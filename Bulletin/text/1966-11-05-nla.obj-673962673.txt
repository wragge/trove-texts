only in India can you live in a Maharajah’s palace-
as a treasured guest
Every evening at dusk, thousands of
green parrots skim across the still
blue waters of the lake, over this
white marble palace (your hotel!),
with its elegant courtyards, cool
colonnades, fountains, gardens. Your
apartment, furnished for a potentate,
glows with colour as its mosaics catch
the water’s reflection. Some say the
Lake Palace at Udaipur is the most
opulent of the world’s fine hotels.
Only India gives you this kind of ex-
perience and so many other de-
lights in the world’s most hospit-
able holiday-land.
So much more to see! Plan an in-
terest-filled holiday (or even a few
days during your next overseas trip)
with AIR-INDIA’s friendly advisers.
They really know India, and work
closely with your Travel Agent to
create your ideal itinerary. And when
you’re there, our offices throughout
India are at your service.

WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’65 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’65
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Hermitage
Long weeks of sunshine and
a rain-free vintage period
favoured the sensitive Her-
mitage (Shiraz) grapes in
1962. After two years in oak,
the wine was bottled and lain
down for further maturing.
Now obtainable, this Hermi-
tage is soft and generous
a full, distinctive wine.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
matured for four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’64 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’64 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

LETTERS
Three Clerics Complain
Sir,
The fact that “Cleric” (8., Sept. 24)
has to remain anonymous, that he can-
not criticise his Church (and ours)
openly for fear of the heavy hand of
ecclesiastical discipline, surely indicates
that something of Christ’s freedom is
missing from the traditional Church.
It seems that the Church today is
beset with a negativist attitude of mind
which thinks of the Christian life in
terms of a certain amount of church-
going, of saying set prayers, of perform-
ing pious practices and of not breaking
the Commandments. Christ’s idea of a
freedom “setting man free” to love
and work for God in our daily lives is
largely missing from the contemporary
scene. This sense of freedom is lost to
the Church because it has also lost much
of its capacity to love. As St. Augustine
expressed it, “Love, and do what you
will;” love creates its own internal
discipline, and where we find that love
missing there flourishes in its place a
multitude of laws, regulations and
sanctions. How many of today’s Chris-
tians would be recognised as the fol-
lowers of Christ if we used His own
criterion. “By this shall all men know
that you are my disciples, that you
have love, one for another”?
According to Catherine Mackerras
(8., Oct. 15), “a person who attends
Mass and the Sacraments is most cer-
tainly a practising Catholic.” At the
risk of upsetting the security which such
a view fosters, we question its validity.
Not for one moment do we doubt the
sincerity of such “Sunday Catholics,”
but, surely, being a Christian means
more than this. Christ’s first and
greatest Commandment to love God
and our neighbor demands of us a prac-
tical charity, the type of consideration
for others that He told us of in the
story of the Good Samaritan and which
was exemplified in His own life as He
"“went about doing good.” The Chris-
tian of today must go out into the
world and work for Christ among his
fellow men. With Mrs. Mackerras we
agree that such Christians are sinners
but, like St. Peter, through apostolic
lives they can become saints. It is a sad
fact, that in proportion to their numeri-
cal strength in the world, Christians
have little influence on its daily exis-

tence and have ceased to be the leaven
of that society.
But if Catholics in Australia have
lost their contact and influence over
contemporary society, could it not be
traced back to the following cause
the attitude of our hierarchy to the
evils of the world, and even to criticisms
and displays of non-conformity within
its own flock?
The Australian Bishops seem to be
obsessed with regarding the faith as
“the pearl of great price,” something
which must be guarded zealously and
handed down in its static entirety to
the next generation. (This would ap-
parently even include the number of
candles which are to appear on the
altar of each Church on “First Class”
feast days.) There is too much fear of
change, fear even of the “excesses” of
Vatican II and Pope John’s revolution.
Far too often is heard the statement of
satisfaction, almost the cry of relief,
from many ecclesiastical authorities
that our Bishops with their caution have
saved us from going the way of British
and American Catholicism. But if we
are to have the correct attitude to
Christianity, then the Bishops should
not be soothing us with caution but
arousing us with statements designed to
break this encrusted traditional thinking
and encouraging us to follow the lead
of our more progressive European and
American counterparts.
The main thing wrong with Christi-
anity is the Church. The internal re-
newal of the Church has been initiated
by Vatican 11, but while the attitude
of the hierarchy continues to be one of
safeguarding the existing edifice, it
seems that Christianity will not be seen
in its right perspective in Australia for
a long time to come.

Killing Adult Education
Sir,
I am strongly opposed to Mr. Bad-
ger’s approval, as reported in “Killing
Adult Education” (8., Oct. 15), of the
University Commission’s recommenda-
tion that support for university adult
education from Commonwealth funds
should terminate from the end of the
1967-1969 triennium. It might seem
surprising that I should be in agreement
with him on many of the points he
makes. Thus, there is no reason to
oppose the suggestion that universities
can or should offer “refresher and other
schools for their own graduates and pro-
vide specialised courses for those people
qualified to participate in them” and
in fact universities have been engaged
in this type of adult education activity
for many years. Nor should there be
much argument that universities are
appropriate bodies to undertake re-
search into various aspects of adult edu-
cation, including “adult learning”
which is not now being neglected as
Mr. Badger suggests and which, of
course, is, or can also be, the subject of
research in Departments other than De-

partments of Adult Education—for ex-
ample, Psychology and Education.
It is with his proposal that universi-
ties should be deprived of the resources
to provide adult education for students
drawn from the community at large
that my disagreement with Mr. Badger
is at its strongest. Here, however, it is
to be noted that he arrives at this con-
clusion only by completely misrepresent-
ing the character of university provision
in this area of adult education as
“popularisation and' dissemination of
general knowledge.” Gn what grounds
can it be asserted that the field of adult
education is exhausted by, on the one
hand, refresher and specialised courses
for, apparently, vocationally selected
groups; and, on the other hand, general-
knowledge courses of a “popularised”
nature? What Mr. Badger omits is the
whole range of adult education activities
especially courses of one, two, or
three years which are offered to mem-
bers of the general public and in which
particular academic disciplines are
treated in a serious and systematic man-
ner. It is a case neither of “popularisa-
tion” nor of “general knowledge.” But
in fact this mispresentation and omission
are essential for Mr. Badger to sustain
his policy proposal.
My criticism of Mr. Badger thus
comes down to the following: (a) he
fails to appreciate that there are many
adults in our community who have a
non-vocational interest in undertaking
serious and sustained study of subjects
at a university level and who have the
ability to do so; (b) he is forced to
ignore the universally accepted view
that the provision of such opportunities
for study falls squarely within the tradi-
tional functions of a university as a “dis-
seminator of knowledge”; and (c) he
omits to deal with the quite funda-
mental point that universities are
uniquely equipped in terms of educa-
tional principle, practice, and experience
to perform this function.
G. SHIPP
University of Sydney
Sir,
Senator Gorton’s statement on the
future of adult education reads: “The
Government agrees that universities
should not set about developing adult
education activities which could be
done more satisfactorily elsewhere, but
at the same time it recognises that there
can be real advantages to the com-
munity in being able to use university
facilities and the talents of university
staff in these informal courses. This is a
matter to which we will give further
consideration in consulting with State
Governments, the Universities Com-
mission and the Advisory Committee
on Advanced Education.”
I fully agree with Mr. Badger’s argu-
ment that “Universities are not, and
should not be encouraged to be, institu-
tions for the popularisation and dis-
semination of general knowledge
throughout the community.” Mr. Bad-
ger suffers from a misunderstanding
here: this is not, as I have often tried
to explain to him, what we have been

drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why

pleasantly surprised.

there is an important need for this in

The Dark World
Sir,
The Prime Minister has the chance
to take a bold step to cut through the
Federal and State tangle of bureauc-
racy, lethargy, and inadequacy that
clogs the administration of Aboriginal
Affairs. Appoint Charles Perkins to the
staff of the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment as, in effect, Under Secretary for
Aboriginal Affairs. Give him a decent
Civil Service salary and facilities, and
charge him to advise on all matters
pertaining to Aboriginal welfare and
the development of a progressive Aus-
tralia-wide policy for the emancipa-
tion of the Aborigines. Authorise him,
too, to act as an “Ombudsman” for
Aborigines so that he may be a bridge
between his people and government.
If the Aborigine can feel that he has
an influential friend of his own race at
Court, and the Government makes good
use of Mr. Perkins’ intimate knowledge
of Aboriginal difficulties and desires, we
may at long last make some real pro-
gress toward solving the problem.

The Yorick Club
Sir,
Marcus Clarke, and many other early
writers, such as Adam Lindsay Gordon,
Henry Kendall, Joseph Furphy (Tom
Collins) belonged to what is perhaps
our oldest literary society of any status
the Yorick Club, founded in Mel-
bourne in 1868.
I am writing in plenty of time for
all lovers of Australian literature and
its history to do something about the
centenary in 1968 of the old Yorick
Club, many of whose members will
always be remembered as the great
writers of the early days of THE BUL-

Tell It on the Mountain
Sir,
The facts of the Snowy Mountains
Authority issue (8., Oct. 8) are not those
stated in your article. The total num-
ber of professional and technical staff
employed by the Authority at June 30,
1966, was 846, not “a mere 98 in the
construction division.” Many of them
were recruited overseas, on the basis
that they were being offered career em-
ployment till at least the early 1980 s.
When through their efforts an acceler-
ated program of construction was
achieved on the Snowy Mountains Pro-
ject, they were led to believe that the
Snowy Mountains Authority organisa-
tion would be used by the Federal Gov-
ernment on future developmental work.
In addition to the staff involved, the
Federal Government has in the Snowy
Mountains Authority a very large in-
vestment in accommodation and ser-
vices, in specialist laboratories, investi-
gation, and design facilities, to which
other Commonwealth, State, and pri-
vate enterprise organisations have in-
creasingly turned for assistance. Their
disbandment would certainly be a loss
of accumulated talent, skill, and
facilities, for much of their success
is based on a team effort by a variety
of specialists, not on individuals.
If it is thought that there are few
rivers in Australia still to be developed,
and this is not a fact, then the outlook
for our future is bleak indeed. How-
ever, less than 15 percent of our avail-
able water resources are now controlled.
The recent drought, which has resulted
in financial losses greater than the cost
of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, has

emphasised again how variable Aus-
tralia’s water resources are.
In these circumstances, it is not sur-
prising that the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment is hesitant in making a
decision on the future of the Snowy
Mountains Authority. In view of the
statements quoted above, they have a
moral obligation to the nation to make
it clear where the Government stands
before the elections. National develop-
ment today needs leadership, vision,
drive, determination, and advanced
technical resources. A policy which dis-
sipates these will result in the loss of
millions of dollars of carefully de-
veloped skills and assets.

86 Years Ago: November 6, 1880
'J'HE Crown Prosecutor at the trial
of Kelly, in his address to the
jury, said the notorious bushranger
was not a hero, but a mean thief,
who picked the pockets of men whom
he had murdered:
He is shorn now, the thief, of his
spurious glory,
And., fetter’d, the murderer lies in
his cell;
While so surely approaches the end
of the story
The herald of vengeance the
funeral bell!
Aye! The funeral bell, and the
rope to come after,
A,nd then the rough clutch of the
hangman so dread,
The unbreakable rope from the
stout oak rafter
A fall and a thud and the
ruffian is dead!
He has lived the vile life of the
rogue and the liar;
His hands are imbrued with the
blood of the brave;
E’en from childhood an outcast, a
thief and pariah
His life has been ever the life of
a knave!
The high heavens cry out on the
crimes he’s committed;
The curses of widows are heaped
on his head:
And is this dire assassin a man to
be pitied
Forgiven the innocent blood that
he’s shed?
Oh, out on such “sympathy”! Can
we discover
One reason this brigand’s existence
to save?
No, indeed! for, in sooth, we should
rather mourn over
Each poor murdered man who lies
stark in his grave!
As he’s lived, let him die: a base
wretch without feeling:
A bushel of quicklime is all that
he’s worth!
Let the grave of a felon his corpse
be concealing
And blot his name off from the
face of the earth!

eral Government’s further delay on

Along the Hard Road
THE Manila Conference must be
counted a great step forward
along the hard road to a just and
enduring peace for Vietnam. The
time for gimmickry for yet more
pleas to Hanoi, for further bomb-
ing pauses —is past.
Communists are not soft-hearted
sentimentalists who will suddenly
be made conciliatory by gestures
of “goodwill” on the part of those
they regard as implacable enemies.
If anything, they will regard them
as signs of weakrtess and indecision.
Realists about power, they are most
likely to be impressed by the
strength of the resistance they meet.
All the postwar crises from Berlin
to Cuba have demonstrated this.
It is a matter of historical fact that
Western strength has been re-
spected and weakness despised.
The Manila communique does
not make it any more difficult for
the Communists to choose peace
if they want it. There can still be
negotiations without pre-con-
ditions, and the aim of the Allied
war effort remains the limited one
of helping South Vietnam against
the attempt to conquer her mili-
tarily. Once that attempt is called
off there can be peace. But while
reaffirming this point, the Manila
Conference went beyond it. It
mobilised unprecedentedly strong
and unanimous international
pledges to the policy of seeing the
war through. Seven heads of Gov-
ernment jointly committed them-
selves without reservation to “con-
tinue military and all other efforts
as firmly and as long as may be
necessary in close consultation
among ourselves until the aggres-
sion is concluded.”
Most important, the American
position is completely firm again.
There had been indications that
they were prepared ito withdraw
on any sign that North Vietnam
was ceasing to send regulars to the
South, Now the U.S. with its
allies is committed not to with-
draw until after three conditions
have been fulfilled; until Northern
regulars have been withdrawn, in-
filtration has ceased, and the level
of violence has been greatly re-
duced. Even then it will only be
done after “close consultation” with
the Allies, and six months will be
allowed to elapse. The reintroduc-
tion of forces is, of course, not pre-
cluded, and should the Communists
resume their war effort, the Allies
would be obliged to resume their
assistance.
The South Vietnam Govern-
ment made valuable contributions
to the joint declaration of policy.
As well as committing itself to con-
tinuing the difficult task of
economic reconstruction while the
war still rages, it has promised two
major lines of social advance.
There is now an unequivocal
promise to hold elections for a
representative parliament before
September, 1967. Secondly, there
is to be a new program of “national
reconciliation” under which Com-
munists who lay down their arms
are to be helped to fully re-enter
civilian life.
Allied troops in the field have
been proving with, great courage
and sacrifice that they can beat the
Communists at their revolutionary
warfare. The military ability ito do
the job has not been in doubt.
What remained unresolved has
been the capacity of the West to
sustain the political support for the
war. Manila has proved there is
a united will to persist.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Death of a Parliament
By ALAN REID
The 25th Federal Parliament died slowly and grimly last week, grinding out
like a sausage machine, legislation and speeches until almost its final moments.
From its ashes and the ashes of the election campaign that will be fought between
now and November 26 will rise the 26th Federal Parliament.
Looking back, the 25th Parliament
was one of change. For 17 years, ever
since he regained the Prime Minister-
ship in 1949, Robert Gordon Menzies
had bestrode the parliamentary scene
like a colossus. But in January 1966
Menzies decided that he had had
enough. He determined that the time
had come to quit. So rich in years and
triumphs (though not nearly as rich in
money as he would have been if he
had stuck to the law, Menzies, at 71,
resigned from both the Prime Minister-
ship and the Parliament. In his place
came Harold Holt, 58, the former
Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the
Liberal Party, and for 16 years
Menzies’ loyal lieutenant in the man-
agement of Australia’s political affairs.
On the parliamentary side, Holt
started uncertainly. He had always been
regarded in the past as a reasonably
good speaker, not in the Menzies class,
but able to hold his own in the cut
and thrust of debate and a quick thinker
on his feet. Perhaps there was a psy-
chological factor in his realisation that
he was a Prime Minister who had
merely succeeded to the office and not
won it by right through the ballot
box.
Whatever happened, Holt could not
achieve the hold over the House that
Menzies had. The Labor Opposition
was quick to realise that here was a
man who would not brush off con-
temptuously their barbs as Menzies
would, and who would not expose
their weaknesses. Here was a man who
was so careful not to make a mistake
that he would not allow a single word
to suffice where he could muster a
dozen circumlocutions.
The Labor Opposition started to
take liberties with Holt that they would
never have taken with Menzies. Oppo-
sition Leader Arthur Calwell started
to conduct across the centre table a
derisive dialogue with Holt that caused
Holt to reach a point of exasperation.
Even in formal speeches, Holt displayed
a dreary addiction to the banal that
produced derision from the Labor
benches and embarrassment among his
own backbenchers. Menzies would
spend days (often, said his enemies, at
the expense of his executive duties)
polishing up a speech so that when
he spoke, even if he was not saying
something notable, he would say it in
notable terms.. But Holt insisted on
speaking unprepared off the cuff. It
was not that his thinking was bad. It
was almost as though he found it
impossible to clothe his thoughts in
the verbal garb that they needed to
make an impression.
Essentially honest, Holt made mis-
takes that a less honest politician would
never have made. On one occasion
challenged as to whether a document
from which he was reading was a
security report, Holt candidly ack-
nowledged that it was, though a babe-
in-arms (and Holt certainly) must have
known the hornets’ nest this was un-
loosing about his unrepentant head.
It has been outside the House that
Holt has had his triumphs and empha-
sised the differences from Menzies that
are to his advantage. He was prepared
to make decisions. Unlike Menzies, who
was rather prone to let time rather
than effort solve a problem, he was
ready to come to a conclusion and
announce the conclusion and stand
by it irrespective of whether the
conclusion was popular or unpopular.
He made the decision to increase the
Australian commitment in Vietnam and
to use National Servicemen integrated
in regular Army units to fill that com-
mitment a decision that in view of
the history of anti-conscription feeling
in Australia was a very courageous one
to face up to and make. He is not
frightened to make unpopular deci-
sions. Even in the past fortnight he and
his Cabinet have made two that can
hardly be classed as vote-winning. The
Holt government has turned down the
Western Australian request for a fur-
ther instalment of aid for the next stage
of the Ord River project and refused
to guarantee the shipbuilding subsidy
that would have brought a shipbuilding
industry to Tasmania.
Holt also brought a new approach
to the problems in Australia’s near
north—the area of the world in which
Australia’s long-term future could very
easily be shaped. For years, Asia has
been a land mass over which Australians
have flown to get to what they regarded
as the important centres of Washing-
ton and New York. For Holt it was
something different. It was the zone iji
which great forces were at work, forces
which could decide the course of Aus-
tralia’s future. His first mission over-
seas was to visit the Australian troops
in Vietnam.
The grateful goodwill that flowed
from this on the part of Asian nations
paid off. At the London Conference
of Commonwealth Prime Ministers I
heard the spokesmen for several Asian
delegations express their appreciation
and gratitude for the interest that Aus-
tralia was displaying in Asia —an in-
terest that the Asian delegations said
had been, manifested by the facts that
Holt’s first journey abroad was to Asia.
Holt also accelerated the movement
away from the old comfortable arrange-
ment with Britain to the new alliance
demanded by circumstance and geo-
graphy with the U.S. clinching the
friendship that Menzies had already
established with President Johnson into
a personal association that culminated
in Johnson’s visit to Australia.
Now comes Holt’s testing time
through the ordeal of a general elec-
tion. If Holt wins on November 26
he could enter the 26th Parliament a
changed man. For he will have stepped
finally from under the giant shadow
cast by Menzies and be Prime Minister,
not by right of succession but by right
of election.
Harold and the Speechwriters
By DONALD HORNE
The typical reaction of the Prime Minister’s friends to his present difficulty in
presenting himself as being at least as good as he is is to say: “What Harold needs
is a speechwriter.” When people say this, what they mean is that he should hire
some second-rater, find him a desk in the basement, and off he goes on his
typewriter, tapping out the speeches.
What Lyndon Johnson and other
American Presidents have done is
quite the opposite of this. To try to
present themselves to the public as
ideals of what a man might be they
have had to woo some of the liveliest
brains in America. To be a Presidential
speechwriter has been, in effect, to be-
come one of the President’s principal
advisers on forward policy. That a
President should consult with some of
the Most Clever Men In All The Land
is not held against him. There is no
shame that other men write his
speeches. Instead, he is given credit for
attracting notable men to his cause.
In a few years’ diversion from their
normal preoccupations, speechwriting
provides them with a chance to exert
influence in politics without dulling
their wits by the tedium and claptrap
of becoming elected persons. To recom-
mend to our own political leaders that
they should use speechwriters is not
merely to suggest that they should
pinch another good idea from America.
It is to suggest a change in the whole
concept of the role of a politician in
Australia. This change is going to come.


It is going to become unbearable to
younger Australians that things should
proceed as they are. First in is likely
to be first served. As it stands, it is
disgraceful that in two and a half days
Lyndon Johnson told us more effectively
what it might mean to be an Austra-
lian and what Australia’s role might be
in the world than most of our own
political leaders have managed to tell
us in the last two and a half years.
Johnson did this in two easy moves.
He praised us. And he gently nagged
us. In praising us he did something that
Australian politicians hardly ever do.
He congratulated us on the very things
at which we are best on our aspira-
tions toward brotherhood and toward
equality in material progress, the Aus-
tralian characteristics of which our own
speechmakers often seem to be most
ashamed, preferring to boast about
more derivative achievements. One
hopes that this provincial period in our
history is just about finished. But why
did Johnson —unlike our own leaders—
also salt his praise by nagging us a bit?
He deliberately raised the questions of
what significant public urges could re-
main in an affluent life like Australia’s,
and he even suggested an answer: that
we should extend our yearnings for
equality toward the people of Asia.
The reason is that Johnson comes
from a more intellectually restless
nation than ours, one in which more
new things are considered possible and
in which there is expected to be con-
stant public debate not only on the
great issues of our time but on the
very meaning of human existence,
which is probably to say the same thing.
A great deal of Johnson’s own rhetoric
was learned from Franklin Roosevelt.
For unemployment read Asia and you
have a large part of it. Even his hand-
ling of the Vietnam War has a 1930 s
touch to it, so that at times he almost
appears to support the right policies
for the wrong reasons.
But he can freshen the Roosevelt
approach and use some of the new
words that are going around, because
in America one of the most important
functions of politics is the making of
speeches that set a general context of
purpose so that individual action is
given meaning, whereas in Australia
we have got into the habit of consider-
ing that the less said about politics the
better.
In America, if you come up with a
few memorable phrases that redefine
what politics should now be about
around those phrases, there might then
spawn all the instruments of policy and
implementation.
Setting new definitions of political
relevance can also send shudders of re-
orientation through many other parts
of the community beyond the govern-
ment, helping to redirect efforts into
new activities when the old ones have
worn out. (In a sentence, one could
almost describe the Australian political
dilemma as what should we do next?)
Out of the whole mess of possibili-
ties, to pick this and that as what now
“Read any good speeches lately?”
matters is the very stuff of political
leadership. Even if all of the ideals
that are thrown up by rhetoric are not
implemented exactly according to plan,
or even implemented in reverse, or not
at all, the process can nevertheless help
sustain belief in the goodness of being
a human being. A political leader has
always had to be created larger than
life, to represent aspiration. But in the
complexities of our present society for
a political leader to do all of this off his
own bat is now almost impossible.
Any statesman is going to be so busily
engaged in the manipulations of power
or in meeting the demands of ceremony
that he will not spend much time think-
ing. Sometimes this doesn’t matter.
There are periods in history when a
statesman is best advised to say and
do as little as possible. But in a time
like our own, when whole useful models
of the world rust away in a few years,
a statesman is likely to look a terrible
dolt if new ideas are not regularly
pumped into him.
He needs people around him, people
he can invite to dinner, who can do
most of his thinking for him, in the
sense that they stimulate his political
imagination. They offer their intel-
lectual wares and the statesman can
then shop around them, seizing what
his own judgment recognises as politic-
ally relevant and practicable. For this
to work properly it may be essential
that these people should be more clever
than the statesman, thereby helping to
make the statesman appear more clever
than he is.
The Manila Line
By PETER SAMUEL
His shirt hanging out of the back of his trousers, his tie loosely noosed around
his neck, the man from External Affairs had little time to talk. He was working a
non-stop day preparing an assessment of the Manila Conference. And he oozed
enthusiasm about its results.
In a short conversation it was that
enthusiasm and conviction of success
that impressed most. What was said
was in substance much the same as the
Prime Minister’s statement in Parlia-
ment. Enthusiasm seems well justified.
The two-day summit meeting put the
seal of approval on the first detailed
statement of joint Allied policy. The
31-point communique which emerged
was merely the public and ceremonial
unveiling of the results of many weeks
of hard bargaining and new thinking
about the intricate problems involved
in trying to bring peace to Vietnam
without endangering the objectives be-
ing fought for. Many new commitments
emerge.
One is to the strongest statement yet
of determination to see the war through
until its limited aim is achieved: “We
shall continue our military and all other
efforts as firmly and as long as may be
necessary, in close consultation among
ourselves, until aggression is ended.”
In Mr. Holt’s words: “It was the view
of us all that only when the other side
realises that our countries mean pre-
cisely what they say that there will
be no weakening or flagging, that all

the necessary measures will be taken
it is only then that the other side will
conclude that the aggression will not
succeed. That conclusion on their part
is the essential requirement for the
bringing about of peace. Firmness is
now the guiding principle.”
President Johnson’s signature was, of
course, the most important, and in the
context of previous policy statements
and actions it indicates ,the abandon-
ment of concessions as a means toward
achieving settlement. On this new hard
line there will be no unilateral de-
escalation, no recognition of the Viet
Cong as a party principal to negotia-
tions, no more bombing pauses, and
fewer gesturings toward Hanoi.
Not that the conference was without
positive new reassurances for Hanoi.
There were two of those: South Viet-
nam’s signature to the renunciation of
any intent to march North and destroy
the Comunist regime, and the promise
by the Allies to withdraw all troops and
evacuate all bases within six months of
the subsidence of violence. So no longer
Is it possible for the Communists to con-
vince anyone that America or its
partners desire any permanent military
presence in Vietnam.
All the same, while the Communists
maintain their military offensive, the
Allied line is to be tougher. Specifically,
Article 29 precludes any withdrawal of
Allied military support until infiltration
has been ceased, Northern personnel
withdrawn, and, most importantly, the
level of violence subsided. Most of all in
Saigon, but also in Seoul, Bangkok, and
Canberra there has been, until this con-
ference, a great deal of worry about the
extent to which the American line
seemed to be weakening in Washing-
ton’s manifest desire to get Planoi
negotiating.
ARTHUR GOLDBERG in the UN
on September 22 significantly
weakened U.S. policy by suggesting “a
phased withdrawal from South Vietnam
of all external forces.” Such a scheme
would not have prevented the indigen-
ous Viet Cong from continuing their
revolutionary warfare. It would not
have prevented the North from continu-
ing to support the war with armaments,
equipment, and supplies (as opposed
to personnel), and it provided no
machinery for enforcement whatso-
ever.
The conference did get the Ameri-
cans to harden at least to the point
where Allied troops must remain until
violence subsides and withdrawal must
at least be done after “consultations.”
Still there is no requirement even that
the Viet Cong armies lay down their
arms, although on the other hand there
is nothing to preclude the reintroduc-
tion of Allied troops should the war
be resumed and South Vietnam again
request assistance.
Negotiations would have to achieve
“effective international guarantees”
that Allied objectives should not be
prejudiced, and presumably these might
contain the provision that foreign
troops be reintroduced on violence
reviving. A most important outcome
of Manila is that the 1954 Geneva
Convention has been side-stepped as
anything except a very long-term
scheme. For the time being the effec-
tive partition of the country is to be
maintained and enforced. A settlement
on the German and Korean models is
to be sought.
Beyond this the conference marked
important progress by the South Viet-
nam authorities. They committed them-
selves as they have not done before to
concrete steps toward the implemen-
tation of constitutional democracy and
representative Government through
declaring a deadline for the formation
of an elected assembly.
The new program of “national recon-
ciliation” offers Communists who lay
down their arms a full place in the life
of South Vietnamese society. Economic
and social improvements as outlined
at Honolulu were spelt out in greater
detail. Australia regards itself specific-
ally committed to diverting resources
to economic aid when military efforts
can be reduced, for what that is worth.

Djakarta Aid
It is a long way round through
Paris to initiate moves for increased
aid to Indonesia. But the appearance
of Australia’s Keith Shann at the De-
velopment Assistance Committee’s
(DAC) meeting there may be a prelude
to new policies.
Acceleration or diversification of our
aid program to Asia generally, and In-
donesia specifically, has long been a
hot issue in Canberra. Now with what
appears to be a commonsense Govern-
ment in Djakarta, the Holt Govern-
ment seems prepared for a rethink.
Australia can do little by itself. Doub-
ling or even trebling our present aid
would scarcely make any impact. To
convince other aid-givers of the
necessity of keeping the Suharto-Malik
Government afloat was one of the
periphery exercises for Mr. Shann, for-
merly Australian Ambassador in
Djakarta.
The DAC is one of the three main
committees within the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment (OECD) a modern and ex-
tended projection of the old Marshall
Plan idea whose 21 full and three
special-status members are responsible
for 90 percent of world aid. DAC does
not administer aid itself: it is a mech-
anism for consultation and discussion
on the main issues and aid policies of
its members (hampered to a certain
extent in its claim as a “world forum”
by the shadow of non-members like the
Soviet Union, China, and Israel, who
all have influential aid programs.)
has special status with-
in OECD, being a member only of
the DAC. As a First Assistant Secretary
of External Affairs in charge of Aid,
Culture, and Information, Keith Shann
headed the Australian representation.
He brought advisers from the Treasury,
Territories, and a Paris-based Australian
expert on DAC affairs. And as Ambas-
sador to Indonesia in the crucial period
of the coup attempt and aftermath,
there was no one more fitting to intro-
duce the argument for more aid to
Indonesia during the “examinations”
by DAC members.
Focal point of discussion was New
Guinea. But observers report that Shann
introduced the Indonesian issue and
that he dwelt for some time on the
“necessity for members to ensure the
new Indonesian government stays
afloat.” Aid-giving to Indonesia has been
so unsuccessful in the past that the new
Suharto government carries the stigma
that nothing useful can be done while
an adequate infra-structure is lacking.
(Foreign Minister Adam Malik thinks
differently, and is desperately trying to
persuade potential aid-givers and credi-
tors that rehabilitation is possible.)
For Australia the need is urgent, and
the problem one with vicious-circle con-
sequences. If the Suharto government
is not dealt with benevolently by OECD
members, its chances of staying de-
crease. We have legitimate economics-
based appeals to OECD members like
America, West Germany, Great Britain,
and Japan, who are unlikly to find mar-
ket conditions improving if there is a
further swing in Djakarta.
Among the obvious difficulties is the
Soviet Union, which is owed more
money by Indonesia than any other
country. Her policy is as yet unclear. In
Djakarta last month a Russian diplo-
mat told me: “We don’t expect a cent.
We have no confidence, either, that
Indonesia can set itself aright.” The
feeling is not restricted to Moscow. The
loss of faith in DAG by its members is
reflected in the relative decline in posi-
tion within OECD. What has been
described as the “inevitability of a
widening of the gap between developed
and under-developed countries” is an
opinion with many adherents.
Australia is appealing at a time when
special conditions in South-East Asia
seem to warrant a revival of aid pro-
grams, but when a certain lack of in-
terest prevails. European members are
more concerned with their own prob-
lems.

Damning the Ord
Western Australia’s Premier, Mr. David Brand, has developed an ulcer in the
past few weeks. And no wonder. Following his defeat on the domestic front over
the apparently innocuous Barracks Arch vote (8., Oct. 15), his disappointment was
so bitter it was widely believed he might resign.
This rumor began with a remarkable
letter by the Speaker, Mr. John Hear-
man, chastising the Liberal back-
benchers who had voted against the
Premier, although this was a free vote.
How would you feel if the Premier now
resigned? he asked of them in an ill-
advised and untimely attempt at wound-
licking.
On top of this has come the far more
significant Ord rebuff from the Com-
monwealth. This has prompted the
State to wipe off hopes of getting the
Federal Government to put up the
$7O million needed to set up the second
stage, a 256-square-mile dam 30 miles
upstream from the present diversion
dam, capable of capturing 1 million
acre feet of the Ord run-off and irriga-
ting 170,000 acres of the rich black
earth, as against the 30,000 acres now
irrigated, 8400 of this planted with
cotton.
Mr. Charles Court, Minister for the
North-West, says of the decision: “We
regard this not as a deferment, but as
a rejection. On previous experience
we can now assume the Ord has been
shelved indefinitely, and we propose
to plan accordingly; this is too import-
ant a national project to be left any
longer. We would probably need to use
capital both from Australia and from
overseas in going it alone, without
Commonwealth help.”
While he would not elaborate
perhaps because no concrete plan has
yet been formulated Mr. Court has
spoken this way before. When he re-
turned from the U.S. last year he said
an American corporation had repeated
an offer to finance the scheme, and
this would bring in large-scale Ameri-
can-style corporation farming to Aus-
tralia for the first time. Despite the
obvious temptations of making such a
gesture in the emotive atmosphere the
Ord rejection has whipped up, the cold
facts of selling out part of Australia
may be hard to justify once the fit of
pique had passed.
Bitterness and suppression of facts
have muddied the Ord from the out-
set, and only history will decide what
might have been in a more illuminated
debate.
First, Dr. Bruce Davidson claims he
was stopped from publishing findings
unfavorable to the Ord economics when
he was a CSIRO scientist; so he quit,
repeated his research, and published
his book, questioning the scheme’s
economics, “The Northern Myth.” He
was challenged by the State Govern-
ment, called an academic knocker, and
it was some time before his views be-
came accepted.
Meanwhile the Federal line unless
it has all along been purely political
cynicism was made clear when Sir
Robert Menzies opened the diversion
dam with his speech that proclaimed
“we are not at the end of something
here today; we are at the beginning
of something. We must go on and on
and on if these great areas of Australia
are to grow and become effective con-
tributors to Australian life.”
But this line changed, and when
Canberra went cold on the scheme the
Department of National Development’s
northern division head Dr. Rex Pater-
son found it his turn to quit;, in a sick
parallel to Dr. Davidson’s gesture.
Many of Dr. Davidson’s arguments have
been refuted by unexpectedly good re-
turns, and Mr. Brand claims con-
fidently that the Ord could produce
cotton profitably, even without a sub-
sidy, with production costs over the
next ten years 25 percent higher and
a world price down 2c a lb.
The bounty, whose $4 million annual
ceiling means that all Australian cotton-
growers compete for it, has brought in
another bitter twist: the Namoi
growers of northern N.S.W., who pro-
duce three-quarters of Australia’s crop,
have been getting yields about 35 per-
cent higher than the Ord’s (because of
freak dry weather, say the Western Aus-
tralians), and have had good argu-
ments against their western rivals.
With the economics of the debate
so balanced, if fuzzy, political con-
siderations prevail. Here again, person-
alities have been all-important. Mr.
Court has clashed on many issues with
his Canberra equivalent in power,
Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen,
who is said to have swung Cabinet
against backing the Ord. Mr. Court
recently caused a potential Cabinet
advocate Mr. Paul Hasluck to storm
out of a Liberal Party meeting after
a row; Sir Shane Paltridge, who might
have tipped the scales in Cabinet, died
early this year.
But if a stalemate has been reached
around the table, the young (average
age 28) Ord farmers, just finishing
picking their crops with yields three
times as high as when they started, are
confident, if bewildered. They plan to
increase acreage next season to 14,000
acres, and believe their average yields
will be up from 8141 b. of lint per acre
to well over 10001 b., world class. They
are going ahead with no Federal
guarantee that the economies of scale
that would come with the second stage
will be forthcoming. Their attitude was
expressed by the growers’ president, Mr.
Dan Clune, when he said of the Federal
decision: “We feel like schoolboys who
have done our homework, passed our
exams, and then got a belt over the
ear.”

Says George Proud
Managing Director of Prouds, Australia’s National Jewellers
\
George Proud,

talks about
Switzerland’s
finest watch.
“There is indeed a watch with a starting price of $425. Its
name is Patek Philippe. It has been the traditional choice of
monarchs and heads of state since 1839. It still is.
“And as you’d expect, it is also the precision leader among
Swiss watches. Eight times during the past ten years, Patek
Philippe took first place in the annual accuracy contest of the
Geneva Observatory.
“We are the only jewellers in Australia to carry this distin-
guished watch. Not only do we regard Patek Philippe as the
finest watch made in Switzerland; we also know that a Patek
Philippe always represents demonstrably fair value.
“I therefore invite you personally to visit a Prouds store in
order to wind a Patek Philippe. (You can actually feel the
difference.)
“Or to compare the movement of a Patek Philippe with that
of a series-produced watch. (You can readily see the difference.)
“Or to let us tell you about the significance of the Geneva
Seal on the movement of a Patek Philippe. (This distinction is
reserved for about one watch in ten thousand.)
“You will then appreciate that, as the owner of a Patek Philippe,
you will have acquired a rare and precious possession which a
grandchild may still be wearing in another day and age.”
Prouds will be pleased to sendyou the latest catalogue of Patek Philippe
horological creations.

Asia: World reaction to the Manila
Conference was not hopeful. The
Communist nations rejected the
Manila peace proposals, and South
Vietnam’s Marshal Ky said he would

The main gains were in Allied
understanding, and a decision to
“secure and hold” rather than
“search and destroy” in South Viet-
nam. Former Foreign Minister
Subandrio was sentenced to death
for subversion in Indonesia. Adam
Malik gathered credits of $lO7 mil-

have closer relations with the USSR
on a basis of anti-imperialism.
Russia protested to China after
young Red Guards stormed the

Moscow spy trial - the familiar image.
From Russia with Law
By ALICE ERH- SOON TAY
A FEW nights before we left Mos-
cow there was great commotion
on one of the floors of the stu-
dents’ hostel on the Lenin Hills. A girl
(we were told) had been raped in her
room; a student who went to her assis-
tance was stabbed. A few weeks earlier
one of our Russian neighbors had told
us that for the second time in several
weeks a man had been murdered while
walking in the park near the university
kicked to death by “hooligans” who
wanted a cigarette, or did not like a
remark he passed, or something of this
sort. Around April, during the Ortho-
dox Easter services, a postgraduate
student in the Department of Atheism
told us proudly how he and his Com-
munist colleagues had stood guard to
protect the believers from “hooligans”
who attacked their processions. Some-
what earlier, when I was beginning to
visit the courts, I was told by a Western
correspondent that the Supreme Court
was occupied in trying a group of men
alleged to have embezzled millions in
Government funds and to have ex-
tended their activities over six repub-
lics of the Union.
Not one of these items was reported
in the Soviet Press. When I made my
way to the Supreme Court to ferret
out the embezzlers I was denied ad-
mission; the Professor of Criminal Law
at Moscow University assured me there-
was nothing of interest going on in the
Supreme Court. Soviet newspapers do
carr Y occasional articles about crime
and criminality, picking out and re-
porting cases as examples of a social
depravity that must be combated. But
there is no routine reporting of crime
or cour t proceedings no direct way
°f telling from the newspapers whether
there is much crime or little crime,
and whether any particular _ crime
(rape, or burglary, or stabbing) is corn-
mon or not. Of several alleged rapes at
the university while I was there, not
one was reported in the student news-
P a per or anywhere else. To the Soviet
citizen who picks up a Western news-
P a per it must seem that the West is
a chaos of criminality beside an orderly,
law-abiding East in which a few scoun-
drels steal money from the Government
and a few anti-social elements occa-
sionally get drunk.
Yet this is exactly what Soviet
citizens do not think. To a foreigner,.
j must Moscow seems a peaceful
anc ] rat h er dreary town, lacking crime
just as it lacks life and gaiety. It
see med absurd to me to think that
hooliganism or juvenile delinquency in
Moscow could possibly be compared
wi(h that in major Westem city
(han ha]f of Moscow>s popu .
lation. Yet almost eveiy Russian I
spoke to thought I was hopelessly naive.
How do you know what our crime
rate is until we publish the figures? a

who was boasting to a Russian how
much further ahead the U.S. would be
economically if, like Russia, it banned
all strikes even for a year. “But
we would have been ahead of you years
ago,” the Russian replied, “if all our
workers stopped stealing for just one
day.”
Generally, Russians displayed the
utmost cynicism in connection with
crime. Almost everyone insisted that
Government workers (that is, the whole
population) steal on the job as a matter
of routine. The woman dispensing soda
is alleged always to pour short; the
factory making prototypes of machines
overestimates its steel requirements and
sells the surplus, partly for factory
profits and partly for personal gain;
waitresses in Moscow restaurants are
widely believed to be making fortunes
quite apart from the tips they receive.
In the University hostel, foreigners are
advised to get special locks for their
rooms. Occasionally Russian news-
papers publish articles and reports ad-
mitting such crimes. The reports, how-
ever, are almost never contemporaneous
with trials and never indicate the num-
ber of prosecutions over a period.
Russians insist that for each criminal
“exposed” in the newspapers there are
several hundred convicted, and for each
one convicted there are several
thousand not charged. (It is one of the
interesting features of the Soviet legal
system that there is no significant dif-
ference between the number of people
convicted and the number charged.)
In June we went to see a play about
juvenile delinquency being performed
privately by the students of one of Mos-
cow’s technical institutes. The play,
like several others about juvenile de-
linquency, had not been passed by the
censorship for performance in a regular
theatre, though several theatres were
interested in it. It was one of the most
serious and striking of the Soviet plays
that we saw in Russia. Four youths
who had kicked and beaten a man to
death after he had objected to their
behaviour were shown in court describ-
ing the events of the day. The court
is puzzled it would like to find a
reason why the youths behaved like
this. Suddenly it clutches at a straw.
“So your father sent you to get vodka
on a Sunday morning,” the judge says
to one of the accused. “And your
father knew you bought some bottles'
for yourself. Is that the sort of home
you come from?” The accused is in-
dignant. “What do you mean, ‘is that
the sort of home’? What are you mak-
ing me out to be different for, as
though I were some sort of monkey?
Everybody’s father sends him out to get
vodka, everybody drinks. I’m not any
different. There isn’t any reason for
what happened. It just happened.”
Among the lawyers, the incidence of
crime is not discussed publicly, and
certainly not in the presence of
foreigners. Even the criminology courses
at the University give the students no
statistics about crime, no estimate of
the prison population, no information
regarding the number of executions. I
had two hints regarding the position.
During a staff seminar I read a paper
on criminal law in Australia to an
audience of senior Moscow academic
lawyers who would have access to such
confidential information. I happened
to mention that the prison population
of Victoria was roughly 1500 for a
population of over three million. There
was an incredulous gasp. The Dean of
the Law School turned to me helpfully:
“You mean 15,000, do you not?” The
fact that I did not mean 15,000 em-
barrassed everyone. A second gasp went
up a little later when I mentioned
that, although several Australian States
have not abolished capital punishment,
there has been an average of only one
execution a year in Australia for the
past 30 years.
Delinquency
'J'HE philosophers are less well
informed about Soviet crime than
the high-ranking academic lawyers, but
openly more cynical. They seem to
have no doubt that material poverty,
lack of personal incentive, cynicism in
relation to the Government and bureau-
cratic incompetence have made Russian
employees into a nation of thieves.
They are also convinced that juvenile
delinquency, coupled with a traditional
Russian drunkenness, is a major social
problem in Russia, showing that Russia
has graduated to the status “industrial
society.” But the West discusses its
problems openly, they say; we Russians
conceal them.
It would be wrong to think of the
Soviet People’s Court, where the vast
majority of ordinary criminal offences
are tried, as an instrument of blatant
political oppression, openly dominated
by the Communist Party and the
Secret Police. The People’s Courts, nor-
mally inadequately housed in a few
partitioned rooms facing on to the
courtyard of an old and smelly build-
ing, have a very wide jurisdiction,
ranging from drunkenness, petty
larceny, and wife-beating to murder
(which in the Soviet Union is not
treated very seriously unless it is
accompanied by hooliganism or is
directed against State interests or State
personnel in their official capacity,
etc.). In atmosphere, they are even
more informal than our magistrates’
courts. The accused is not confronted
by any legal points or procedures too
complicated for him to follow; the wit-
nesses are not subject to any rules of
evidence save the commonsense insis-
tence that they keep somewhere near
the issue before the court. People can
and do volunteer to give evidence from
the body of the court, and I have heard
a judge stop a witness in order to
listen to an interesting interruption
from a spectator who disagreed with
the evidence being given. The general
line is that the court wants to hear
anything that is relevant, whether about
the events said to constitute the offence
or about the character, past behaviour,
and present motive of the accused. The

notion of relevance is stretched pretty
widely 1 once entered a courtroom
where the judge was cross-examining
the accused about the extent to which
he was. maintaining his divorced, wife
and children, to learn, a few minutes
later, that the offence being tried was
one of false pretences. There is no
notion in Soviet law that the accused
should be found guilty of an offence
before his character is examined. (This,
naturally, does operate very much to
the disadvantage of people with “bad
records in the past, even if their past
delinquencies are of a totally different
character from the delinquency they
are being accused of at the moment.)
If Soviet courts are informal, the
judge and the two assessors who sit
with him are now extremely scrupulous
to see that “Soviet legality” is strictly
observed. The point is that “Soviet
legality” has little to do with a Com-
mon Law lawyer’s conception of justice
(a fair and equal contest, not preju-
dicing the accused, etc.). “Soviet
legality” is essentially a set of bureau-
cratic procedures meant to ensure that
police, prosecution, and the court will
not behave arbitrarily, but will act with
proper authority and in the proper
form at each step of the way. The
Criminal Procedure Code, for example,
stipulates that the investigation papers
prepared by the Procuracy shall be
submitted to the court in a certain form,
with certain accompanying declarations.
I have seen judges go into utter panic
because the documents have not been
arranged in the order required or have
lacked a necessary signature on the
police file. I would certainly say that
such formal compliance seems to all
Soviet officials connected with the law
much more important than the actual
content of the rules themselves or the
question whether they ensure a fair
trial.
There is no doubt that in the Soviet
court the result of the trial has nor-
mally been pretty well predetermined
by the police investigation, the records
of which are given to the judge in full
before the trial begins. The theory is
that the police investigation is itself
a sort of trial, the outcome of which
is really only confirmed by the court,
Soviet court proceedings therefore nor-
mally have none of the excitement of
a Common Law trial. There are no
surprises and there is usually no real
contest. Often you hear the accused
mutter, “I have nothing to say, you
know everything.” In the first thirty
cases that I attended, twenty-nine of
the accused had pleaded guilty and
most of them had not availed them-
selves of their right to have a defence
lawyer. The one who pleaded not
guilty (to a charge of attempted rob-
bery) had been convicted, seven years
earlier, of murder and had managed
to have two further convictions in be-
tween. No doubt because his situation
demanded it, he came represented by a
lawyer (a fellow-Georgian) who was
willing to fight on the facts. This
seemed to do some good: the accused

received only half the maximum sen-
tence. It was the only time I saw the
prosecution seriously challenged.
Disastrous as the Soviet legal atmos-
phere is for anyone facing moral or
political persecution, there is no doubt
that the overwhelming majority of
persons coming before the People’s
Courts are accused of non-political
offences and are guilty as charged. They
do receive rough justice and seem to
accept the result as fair enough.
Neither accused nor accusers think it a
right to escape punishment via technical
loopholes or by too strong an insistence
that the prosecution must prove its case
without help from the accused. Where
there is patent unfairness is when the
offence is treated as having political
overtones. “Hooliganism” is treated
politically, merely punching someone
in the face as an ordinary non-political
activity. It depends entirely on the
mood of the police and the extent to
which the city administration or the
newspapers or the Government have
got fed-up with this kind of case
whether a man who punches
man in a restaurant is charged with
“hooliganism” or with punching a man.
The former charge will get him roughly
double the sentence; but no defence
lawyer would seriously attempt to
argue on his client’s behalf that he did
punch, but was not a hooligan. If he
were to make such an attempt, he
would find the Soviet Criminal Code
far too vague in its definition of “hooli-
ganism” for the defence to have much
ground to stand on. Soviet legislators
tend to cast their net very wide.
Soviet mirror
JN so far as the Soviet courts are a
mirror of Soviet society, they con-
firm the cynical attitude of Russians on
the question of Soviet criminality.
There is a constant stream of cases in-
volving hooliganism, petty thieving
from neighbors and from work, wife-
beating, and theft or assault under the
influence of liquor. Those committing
these offences seem overwhelmingly
ordinary Soviet citizens and not mem-
bers of a specific criminal class. The
sentences, on Western standards, are
very harsh. (Judges obviously con-
scious of this who explained pro-
ceedings to me in detail while they
were going on, then displayed great
anxiety that I should leave when the
final adjournment came and before
sentence was imposed.) Two people
charged with a rather minor assault in
public were given three and five years’
hard labor respectively. The cynics at
the university were in favor of this
severity. It seemed to them justified by
the serious proportions that petty crime
was reaching in the Soviet Union.
Those sentenced looked dazed and
helpless.
After all, the two defences they
would offer to their friends are still
completely unacceptable to a Soviet
court, and virtually no Soviet citizen
would try them. You cannot say, “I
do not earn enough and I live badly,”
nor can you say, “I was tempted be-
cause everybody does it.” To say this
would be to come too near to a truth
utterly unpalatable to the Soviet ad-
ministration. At its lower levels, Soviet
crime is remarkably like the crime com-
mitted by the Western proletariat at
the end of the 19th century, when life
was hard and the future drab.

THE BULLETIN has received so
many comments on Henry Fairlie’s
brilliant article “The Style of LBJ,”
in the issue dated October 22, that
in all fairness we should point out
that the article did not originally
appear in THE BULLETIN. It first

Even the experts were saying this only 13 years ago. But Ampol’s initiative and
persistence were finally rewarded when oil was first discovered in Western
Australia in 1953.
Ampol gets things done! Ampol, the Australian Company has its stake in this
country alone. That’s why it pioneered the search for Australian oil and has
contributed to our national development in so many other ways.
It is only with your help that Ampol can continue these achievements.

MORE IN SORROW than in anger
Harold Dvoretsky reports from London
that at the 1966 International Motor
Show, Australia again missed the pub-
licity boat.
“Although a 6ft. 6i'n. kangaroo
gained some limelight for itself and
the Australian-built Valiant, the main
chance was lost on the balcony floor
above,” Dvoretsky reports. ‘There, hid-
den away on a couple of stands, was
Australia’s greatest engineering achieve-
ment. An achievement which only a
few months ago (as I wrote in THE
BULLETIN) took Australia from being
the place where sheep come to a tech-
nological nation in its own right.
“The achievement was Jack Brab-
ham’s success in bringing his Australian-
designed car with an Australian-built
engine to victory against the best in
the world. Provided, I wrote, Australian
firms had the sense to follow up, Aus-
tralia’s engineering export potential
could be given an export boost as never
before.
“Alas, the follow-up has been neglig-
ible. It was almost as though we were
seated we had stepped on the toes of an
industrial giant or two. In the accessory
gallery of the motor show the larger
Repco stand carried a small centrepiece
announcing that Repco were pleased
to congratulate Jack Brabham on his
winning the world championship for
the third time. But there was hardly a
mention that theirs was the engine that
had powered the car. There was no sign
of the engine, no sign of even an
engine.
“A few yards away on the smaller
Kerry-Repco stand, a side wall sported
a couple of small pictures of Brabham
and the car and another noted that
Brabham was 1966 world champion.”
The Bulletin Book
WITH A SMALL SIGH of relief we
announce this week the publication by
Cheshire’s of “The- Bulletin Book, a
Selection from the 19605,” in time both
for Book Week and the Christmas mar-
ket.
Another book just published by
Cheshire’s is “A Long Way from
Home,” a collection of short stories by
a former member of THE BULLETIN
staff, Desmond O’Grady. Cheshire’s,
who grow somewhat aggrieved some-
times when they are written off as
educational publishers only, have some
interesting novels just out or forth-
coming. These include Judah Waten’s
“A Season of Youth,” Raymond
Aitchison’s “Contillo,” Maslyn Wil-
liams’ New Guinea novel, “The Far
Side of the Sky,” Joan Lindsey’s “Pic-
nic at Hanging Rock,” Kenneth Cook’s
“Tuna,” and Dal Stivens’ “Four.”
Just published, too, is George Far-
well’s “Mask of Asia,” on the Philip-
pines. This will be published in New
York the week Farwell is there on his
way to--Montreal, where he will act as
public relations officer for the Aus-
tralian exhibit at Expo ’67.
Warm Welcome
WE RECEIVED the following message
under plain wrapper:
“Do you agree with Craig McGregor?
“The author of ‘Profile of Australia,’
Craig McGregor, warmly welcomes
criticism and discussion of the ideas
put forward in this book. Write to him
care of the publishers, Hodder and
Stoughton Ltd., 429 Kent Street, Syd-
ney, and he will reply personally to
your letter. In the hope of stimulating
further discussion of Australia today,
the publishers will award $lOO to the
most perceptive letter, comment, criti-
cism, or review to reach them by
January 31, 1967.”
What we wouldn’t give if we had
it to stem the flood!
Skal
ONE OF what you might call the old
school of battling Australian writers,
Colin Simpson, who publishes through
Angus and Robertson in Sydney and
Hodder and Stoughton in London, has
been “feeling the breeze” this last six
months because he didn’t produce a
book last year.
“It’s no 40-hour job,” he said at the
gala skal party thrown for him by the
Wilhelmsen Agency to launch his latest
book, “The Viking Circle.” “It’s 15
hours a day, and often seven days a
week. There is so much research and so
much checking up to do on these travel
books that after four or five months
there’s another ten months of work.”
He is a slow writer, which compli-
cates things further, and, as he lives by
royalties alone, he remains in the red
until the next book comes off the type-
writer. “I won’t make a penny on this”
(“The Viking Circle”) “until 4000
copies have been sold. But we should
make that all right.”
No matter what difficulties he faces.
Simpson is at the moment Australia’s
most successful author of popular non-
fiction and Angus and Rogertson’s star
performer. Director George Ferguson
announced at the party that Simpson’s
eight books had sold over 350,000 copies
in Australia. He also made the astonish-
ing statement that Australian publishers
had long been criticised for not pub-
lishing books set in other countries, a
slur that could no longer be cast at
Angus and Robertson’s. But where else
can you set a travel book?
Angus and Robertson’s do not help
their author on his travels except in the
initial stages of planning when their
staff help to make the way smooth.
Arranging bed and breakfast for Colin
Simpson round the world is not always
easy. The more civilised countries are
eager to help and open the doors of
their aircraft with enthusiasm. Scandin-
avian Airways were most helpful during
the research for “The Viking Circle,”
and even Russia agreed to let him in at
a reduction of 50%. But Katmandu, his
latest objective, sent back a long cable
apologising for not being able to help
him with accommodation or any other
service like that, but saying they were
willing to help him in any other way;
a suggestion which Simpson interprets
as meaning they will give him a bearer
to carry his four cameras.
“Although I am often a guest-in-the-
house in foreign countries I am not a
spineless one. I don’t mind being rude.
I never hesistate to roast them if they
need it, and most of them are quite
satisfied as long as my criticisms are
fair. Russia, of course, was very upset
about ‘Take Me To Russia,’ but some
of their hotels, even at 50% discount,
were terrible.”
He says 'rather wistfully that Morris
West tells him that his (Simpson’s)
books sell better in Australia than
West’s. “But I don’t make that sort
of money. Nothing within shouting
distance of West or Cleary. I have to
spend half of what I get on my travels,
because even with bed and breakfast

Business hours
LOOKING much more like an insur-
ance salesman than an artist, Victorian
Fred Williams has recently been on
exhibition, along with his landscapes,
at Rudy Komon’s gallery in Sydney.
“The worst day I’ve had in two years,”
Williams told us, describing the open-
ing of his sell-out exhibition. “We
hung around for four hours, for four
hours, while Rudy made up his mind.
Just standing around while he decided
what he’d do. It was agony.
“I’m very poor copy, you know,”
Williams went on. “I just paint. I paint
the way people go to the office. I go
into the studio and I work ordinary
business hours. Mind you, I don’t
always paint sometimes I’m stretch-
ing canvas, or preparing brushes, or
reading but technically I’m paint-
ing. It takes me a long time. This,”
gesturing back toward the main gal-
lery, “is the product of two years* work.
“I like to work with the best possible
art materials. I use the best brushes.
I use French canvas whenever I can.
,1 couldn’t stand painting on masonite.
I’d never manage to get any feeling
into it. I must have the best.”
Fortunately for Mr. Wiliams, money
is not a problem. Rudy Komon “dis-
covered” him five years ago, and has
been investing in him ever since. “Every
month the cheque comes. I have no
money problems. Of course, 18 months
ago he wanted this exhibition. I said
no. A year ago I said no. Six months
ago it was the same answer. I wasn’t
ready. But you have to exhibit eventu-
ally. It’s all going very well. Oh, yes,
I’ll have enough to live on for two years
from this.
“I don’t let them all go. One has to
keep something. I paint, knowing that
I will sell the product of my brush, but
I paint for myself, too. It’s a business
like any other. I know they will be hung
eventually on someone’s walls, involved
with furniture and curtains and so forth,
but I’m not too concerned about this. I
would like everything I paint to have
the perfect lighting, or even the good
light of the studio, but, of course, even
gallery presentation isn’t perfect.
“I like painting. I like doing land-
scapes. I enjoy the country, but I prefer
the city. I go out and make sketches
interminably. Then I bring them back
and work in my studio. The landscapes
are not of actual scenes, but rather com-
posites of sketches I have made. I can’t
wait to get back home to work again
now. But I won’t fly. I’m sick of rush-
ing. I’m going back to Melbourne by
boat. I’m sorry I’m not more inter-
esting. I don’t wear a beard or dress
like an artist because I don’t have the
figure for it.”
Openings may be agony for the 39-
year-old man from the Dandenongs, but
the impressive progress of his career so
far has prepared him to accept them
now. He originally studied at the
National Gallery Schools in Melbourne,
then went on to the Chelsea Art School
in London, and later to the Central
School of Arts in London. His list of
exhibitions and prizes won was impres-
sive even before his major win, the

Scholarship, in 1963.

Originally a hard-core journalist
with 18 years’ experience on Sydney
papers, Simpson owes his success to the
ABC’s “Australian Walkabout” series.
Simpson conducted the show for several
years, then began to write a book about
his adventures. After long travail he
found he was writing only about
Aborigines. So he turned it into “Adam
in Ochre.”
This met with some critical success.
“This was only because I was a
journalist and other journalists were
being kind to me. Now that I’m get-
ting a bit successful, of course, they
cut me to ribbons. I get good reviews
in the London ‘Times,’ which is
comforting, but not very productive.”
The Tetters of Trevor Gooseboot
(Intercepted by Will Rushton)
Dear Mother,
I’m sorry that I failed to write to you last week, but the excitement of
the President’s visit was altogether too much, and I have only just recovered
from an attack of acute depression. However, that is all behind us, and Aus-
tralia can now settle down to the peace and quiet of an election. I am glad I
shall not be called upon to choose between the two protagonists. Hobson had
more choice. Had I the vote I would probably cast it with the 78 percent of
“Don’t Knows.”
During the Presidential visit, patriotic to the last, I was wandering about
reminding my Australian friends of their heritage. “Remember,” I was saying,
“you don’t play cricket against America. They don’t play Rugby League and
Rugby Union. Does New York sport an Earl’s Court?” and other remarks of
that ilk. And I have to admit the reception was sympathetic. “Vietnam can’t
go on forever,” they said. “The Ashes undoubtedly will, bent arms or no.”
It was then news came from England on the Wallabies tour. The Wallabies
skipper struck down by a violet attack of acne in the scrum. An Englishman,
nursing an extremely unpleasant facial disorder, garnered in New Zealand, had
passed on the complaint in the intimacy of the ruck. Immediately a Wallaby
retorted. In the next game he bit off the ear-lobe of an Oxford undergraduate.
This sort of thing is hardly likely to bind the ties of the Commonwealth.
Picture my alarm when I saw the Royal Navy entering Sydney Harbor. Was
history to be repeated? Was the ghost of Jenkins’ ear to walk again? (Though
how far the ghost of anyone’s ear can walk is a matter of controversy.) How
relieved I was to find it was a visit of goodwill, and to hear the friendly crash
of chair on head as our merry tars discovered Sydney.
Yours ever,
Trevor.
P.S. My little drawing this week has nothing to do with my epistle. I just
thought that, as you are a keen admirer of Mr. Vorster, it might annoy you.

AROUND MELBOURNE
In the Wake of the Shrimp
THE year 1965 will always be
remembered as the year when
female outranked horses at
Flemington. I shall never forget one
red-faced furious owner. “I went
into the ring to see my horse coming
back. I couldn’t even get near it.
You know what was happening?
They had the Shrimp in there, judg-
ing blasted female get-ups. I reckon
the VRC has gone out of its mind.”
But it has .to be admitted that
females are much better for attract-
ing world-wide publicity than horses.
Last year for the Fashions in the
Field contest, the VRC had splendid
backing.
Wool, on behalf of natural fibres,
brought out the lovely French model,
Christine Borge. Dupont, in the op-
posite corner, brought out Jean
Shrimpton on behalf of unnatural
fibres.
Christine Borge as she arrived
walked down the steps of her air-
craft and thereupon fainted most
beautifully away on the tarmac. The
publicity was tremendous and she
remained on front pages for three
days. Wool was ahead, and Christine
said: “I’d like to see how the Shrimp
will beat that one.” What the Shrimp
did is now history.
Full of confidence Dupont opened
its challenge very early this year, by
announcing that the synthetics were
bringing out Baroness Fiona Thyssen.
Not only was she a name of world
social rank but she was New Zealand
born. Admittedly the Baroness left
New Zealand when she was 10
months old, but here in Melbourne
we like to keep up a tradition of New
Zealanders triumphing at the Mel-
bourne Cup.
the announcement that the
Baroness would come we waited
eagerly to see what wool would do.
How could they outshine Baroness
Thyssen? Rumors were afoot that
they would fight back with Princess
Ira Fuerstenberg, or maybe even
Princess Anne. Alas, this was not to
be and finally they pulled out of the
lists altogether. Dupont finally clin-
ched its triumph by also bringing
over Mrs. Peter Young, Tania Ver-
stak, no less.
The Baroness duly arrived and at
the Press conference at Essendon air-
port somebody asked her: “What is
your favorite material.” “Wool,” said
she innocently. Perhaps not able to
believe it, someone asked again.
“WOOL?” “Yes,” she said, “white
wool.”
She said later: “That went down
with Dupont like 10 tons of lead . . .
But this was the first time I had
been confronted by a whole crowd
of reporters. I was petrified. There
was radio, TV cameras, everything.
My mind boggles at the thought of
people going through this all the
time. I have only been at a Press
conference once, when I was
married. My husband answered the
questions that time ... in three
languages.”
Actually the Baroness speaks four
languages herself. English, French,
German, and Italian “not quite so
well.” “In Europe you have no
choice. You really have to do this.”
The John Batman Inn in Queens
Road was delighted to have her,
and, as it does for all celebrities, it
put out a welcome sign: THE
JOHN BATMAN WELCOMES
FIONA BARONESS THYSSEN.
The Baroness didn’t like it.
“Either that comes down or I go.
It is in the worst possible taste.”
At 34, to the jaded eyes of a news-
man, she looks very good indeed,
very lean, long slim legs, exquisite
hands, and her features not pretty,
but beautiful in the manner that
English women can be very beauti-
ful.
One remembered her particularly
from a TV film, when she was de-
picted as living the life of the mil-
lionaire’s wife motor-cars, speed-
boats, personal jet aircraft, glorious
collection of art treasures —so it was
“. .. and as they turn, it’s Miss
Laroo by a short hem.”
interesting to piece together her life
as it is now, two years after the
separation.
She lives at St. Moritz, no ser-
vants, just a nanny. She drives a
Mini-Cooper. Until last year she had
a racing car, but she had an accident,
and that was the end of it. “I was
entirely in the right, driving on the
RIGHT-hand side of the road, when
I was hit by a stupid Englishman.
As he dragged me unconscious from
the car he said he was trying to
teach me a lesson.”
S HE . loves St. Moritz and she skis
all the winter. “My daughter,
Francesca, 8, skis like a bomb.
She’ll be right away from me in a
year or two. My boy, Lome, 3, he
doesn’t ski yet, but he skates beauti-
fully. He learnt when he was two.”
So life now is very quiet. The
Baron had three studs, one in Ger-
many, another in France, and
another in Ireland. He had 150
horses racing. “The sad thing,” said
the Baroness, “was that he wasn’t
interested. I kept things going, loved
it, I went to every racetrack in
Europe. Now that’s finished and his
sister has taken over the interest.”
Money? “I live simply and have
enough for everything I want. I like
to travel and if I want to do that,
well, I have to do things like this.
In the past year or so I have done a
job for ‘American Vogue’ in
Arizona, another in Ceylon, and I
did a job for Cecil Beaton in Paris.”
The Baron, she said, didn’t like
it and was most annoyed when she
took up modelling again as Baroness
Thyssen. “But I have done taste-
ful things. There was one picture
taken from behind, hair flowing
down my bare back. It was the
loveliest picture ever taken of me.
Not lovely me,, lovely picture. He
was almost convinced after, he had
seen it.”
So now she has arrived here with
several thousand dollars worth of
clothes. They have come from the
Paris houses of Givenchy, Courreges,
and Ungaro. The Ungaro clothes
are mostly for the Cup Carnival.
“These are a little bit kooky,” she
said. “Not the sort of things you
would normally wear but clothes to
wear when being stared at.”
The Baroness is still a brave 34-
year-old. She wears her skirts well
above the knee, which she assures
everyone is still the Paris fashion.
When asked whether the mini skirt
is finished she says “Good heavens,
no. It is getting shorter than ever,
even to 12 inches above the knee.”

Best Young Player Anywhere
Bruce Devlin’s Rise to the Top Ten in Golf
By JACK POLLARD
IN May, 1963, Bruce Devlin was
stranded in America with his wife
and two children and only 400
dollars, not enough to pay his hotel
bill, let alone get his family back to
Australia. He had sold his last remain-
ing assets two blocks of land in
Goulburn, N.S.W. and he just had
to win prizemoney in the Waco-Turner
Open at Ardmore, Texas, to remain
solvent.
This week when Devlin plays in the
Dunlop tournament at Kensington in
Sydney, he will have a strong chance
of adding a big piece of the prize-
money to the $200,000 or more (my
estimate, not his) he has made since
those grim days in 1963.
Devlin’s comeback to affluence and
virtual security for life in the short
space of three years is one of the most
remarkable stories of Australian sport,
for it has been achieved despite heart-
breaking setbacks and for much of the
time in defiance of a crippling list of
ailments.
He won $lll5 that crucial week in
•Ardmore, $B5O in prizemoney and $265
in bonuses for eagles and birdies. This
got him to the next tournament on the
U.S. tour and each week for the next
three months he picked up enough
prizemoney to get his family on to a
boat for Australia in August. On his
way home Bruce stopped off in New
Zealand and won three tournaments,
the New Zealand Open, the Caltex,
and the Wills, £l7OO sterling worth in
five weeks. That was the start of it.
Back in Australia, at the end of ’63,
he won four out of seven events and
enough money to put a down-payment
on a house.
!YY"HEN Devlin hits off in the Dunlop
this week he will have shared in
the prizemoney for 51 successive tour-
naments around the world, 36 of them
in America, where his sequence is the
longest any golfer has ever gone without
missing a cheque. Right now he is
probably among the best ten golfers in
the world and very close to the finest
player Australia has ever had.
“In two or three years’ time Bruce
will be the greatest player in the world,”
Nor,man von Nida told me last week.
“His temperament is magnificent. He
has every shot in the bag. His only
weakness is a slight tendency to steer
his iron shots instead of hitting them
freely. This comes from the pressure
of playing for big money every week
in the year. I’ve advised him that he
can overcome this by taking a week or
ten days rest every month. If he does
this he can be the greatest golfer we
have ever seen.”
And yet only a year ago Devlin
frequently suffered agony in the con-
cluding stages of tournaments. Until
a brilliant American surgeon stripped
26 varicose veins from his legs in a
three-hour operation, which required
100 stitches, he could not sleep because
of the pain in his legs, and after most
shots he sprawled on the grass to rest
them or sat on a shooting-stick.
A year ago the accumulation of these
worries and the incredible travel load
he set himself had brought a haggard
and drawn look to his fresh young
face. His eyes were circled in shadows
and thrust back in his head. I thought
the strain of big tournament golf had
got him and that he would soon be
washed up, an opinion shared by Don
Lawrence, the Melbourne “Age’s”
globetrotting golf writer. This strain
is very real, indeed, for topline golfers.
It has converted the great Ben Hogan
into a sad figure on the greens, where
he is sometimes unable even to move
his putter back from his ball. It shorK
ened Von Nida’s time as a big money-
winner. It has broken Sam Snead’s
putting nerves, and reduced Cary
Middlecoff to a state where he can’t
even line up fairway shots.
So it’s something of a minor miracle
that spectators who watch Devlin next
week in Sydney will be watching a
superb shot-maker free of worries about
his health, a confident, smiling figure
walking on sound legs for one of the
first times in a big Sydney tournament.
Even last year when he won the Wills
tournament in Sydney he was anxious
about his legs; it was a try-out after
recuperating from his operation and
his legs were still a patchwork quilt
of vividly new scars.
Devlin will be competing, too, with
the confidence of having ended his
appalling run of near-misses nine
seconds in two years and having this
year collected the biggest prize a golfer
Bruce Devlin
can win, $35,000 from the Carling
world championship at Royal Birkdale
in England.
This is not the ailing Devlin, who, in
1960, became the first amateur for 21
years to win the Australian Open. This
is not the quietly spoken country lad
who, in 1958, led Australia to a notable
victory in the first Eisenhower Cup
competition at St. Andrews, Scotland,
finishing top amateur in the world.
This is a tough, seasoned professional
who has travelled more than half a
million miles farther than a round
trip to the moon to play golf, winner
of $86,000 so far this year and $65,000
last year, a 28-year-old whose income
from endorsements alone would keep
most of us in luxury.
]?OR the past year I have been work-
ing with Devlin on a book, piecing-
it together in between his harrowing
schedule of overseas tournaments and
interstate trips. I have found him com-
pletely unchanged by success, still the
calm, home-loving young man, happiest
when he is fussing about the kitchen
with his wife, his well-disciplined chil-
dren, Kelvin and Kerrie, and an un-
ending array of callers who continually
put him in the position of a king hold-
ing court.
The Devlins moved recently from a
house which they built three years ago
in the Canberra suburb of Hughes to
a bigger, more expensive house at
Deakin. They like Canberra and I
doubt if they would ever leave it.
“Bruce isn r t the type to become swollen-
headed, but it’s good to live in a city
where there are so many celebrities he
is hardly noticed,” says Gloria. Bruce
relaxes in a lounge chair, a tall (6ft.
lin.), lean (lOst. 101 b.), sandy-haired
man who once was the best hockey
goalie in Goulburn and is now learning
to fly.
He is supposed to be resting, and
heaven knows he has earned it, but
when Von Nida calls from Queensland
asking Bruce if he will take two or
three days out of this ten-day spell
to fly to Brisbane and play a round
or two and coach a few kids, Bruce
cannot find it in his heart to refuse.
He shrugs at Gloria as he puts the
phone down. “It was ‘The Von,’ honey,
and he wants me to hold some clinics
for these kids . . .” Gloria sighs and
says, “I know when do you have
to go?”
The mailman comes and hands over
a vast pile of letters. Some of them
are from Bruce’s managers, Interna-
tional Management Inc., who also
handle Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus,
Gary Player, and Bob Charles, a slick
outfit which has swallowed all the text
books on executive efficiency and the

fast-buck. The power in International
Management Inc. is Mark McCormack,
a companionable, blond-haired Ivy
Leaguer, but I get the impression the
donkey work is done by his likeable
aide Arthur J. Lafave, jun. For a handy
slice of everything Bruce makes they
are supposed to take the worry out
of his business affairs so he can con-
centrate on his golf. They tell him
where to play, when to play, what to
sign, how valid are his contracts. At
the last count they had steered Arnold
Palmer to the head of 37 different
corporations, so they know their stuff.
Bruce says a hard-bargainer like Lafave
is necessary if the Devlins are to pre-
serve some of the money Bruce is mak-
ing. Most of Lafave’s clients are in a
bracket in which they have to make
four dollars to keep one.
Bruce Devlin is very loyal to every-
one who helped him in the grim years,
the time when he needed a few hundred
here and there for his fare to America
and to pay his bills. He has been
offered vast sums to leave his cigarette
company, sports-goods firms repeatedly
try to tempt him to leave the outfit he
started with, and barely a week passes
without a newspaper trying to get him
to leave the one he has been with for
years. He is courteous and a good
listener, but he will not desert the
firms which helped him when he was
a nobody, any more than he can refuse
The Von when the little man whisks
him to Queensland. He doesn’t even
have contracts with some of these firms,
a factor which undoubtedly disturbs
Lafave greatly.
jT
all began with a motor accident.
Bruce’s dad, Arthur Devlin, was a
contracting plumber in Goulburn, and
Bruce caddied occasionally to make a
few bob pocketmoney. One night
Arthur Devlin’s car was hit by a coal
truck and he lost an arm. A few weeks
later when he got home to Goulburn
from hospital the whole family shared
his grief. To try to lift his father out
of his depression and get him out on
the course again, Bruce decided to
take up the game seriously.
That was in 1951, when Bruce was
13. For the next eight years father and
son roamed Australia’s golf courses to-
gether, usually with Arthur acting as
Bruce’s caddie. It cost Arthur Devlin
all the £7500 he got in compensation
for his accident, but his son was
thoroughly educated in golf. They were
a heart-warming pair, the lanky kid
with the magnificent strong hands, and
the sunburned one-armed caddie jug-
gling his son’s bag, the flag stick, and
an umbrella which prevented Bruce
getting wet as he putted in the rain.
The experts will tell you that in his
amateur days there has never been a
finer iron player than Devlin. He had
left school in a huff when the head-
master demanded that he choose be-
tween golf and his studies, and he had
become an apprentice in his dad’s
plumbing business. In the six years it
took Bruce to get his Master Plumber’s
certificate, he developed hands and
wrists which hit screaming iron shots,
won just about every honor in amateur
golf, and completely rehabilitated his
dad in the process. Today Arthur
plays off a ten strokes better handicap
than the 24 he was off when he had
two arms. I doubt if there is a putter
in the land to match him.
When Von Nida first saw Bruce play
he gave it as his solemn opinion that
Bruce would never be a good golfer.
Btuce changed his grip slightly and cut
down on his backswing and, in 1960,
beat Von Nida 4 and 3 in an Amateur
v. Pros match at Killara. Long before
that, however, The Von had stood up
before a big audience and publicly
apologised for his mistaken forecast. He
did it with such warmth and sincerity
that Bruce was deeply touched and he
and Von Nida have been close friends
ever since.
Bruce turned professional after win-
ning the 1960 Australian Open as an
amateur, the first lily-white to win the
event since Jim Ferrier in 1939. He
used the shooting-stick a lot in that
event and was in great discomfort in
the final round, scraping home with
rounds of 69, 69, 69, and 75.
Bruce had married the only girl he
ever took out, Gloria Gale, who had
been his sweetheart in the Goulburn
Primary School, and now there were
two children to support. He was very
reluctant to leave amateur golf, which
had given him three good trips over-
seas, but after talking it over with
Gloria and The Von he decided to give
the multi-million-dollar U.S. golfing
circuit a fly.
Unlike other visiting golfers who have
won pri ze money in America, he is
extremely popular among the U.S.
players whom he deprives of cash so
often. Hfe does a great job for Aus-

$2 to See the Cup Show
By MAURICE CAVANOUGH
WITH Meurig Davies, who is now
painting Aboriginal children on
the outskirts of Alice Springs, I
spent two years poring over files in
the Melbourne Public Library, check-
ing the records of the Victoria Racing
Club and interviewing old gentlemen
who invariably maintained that they
knew Carbine’s jockey, Bob Ramage,
like a brother. The results of all this
research we distilled into the 110,000
words that make up “Cup Day,” the
story of the first one hundred years of
the Melbourne Cup.
The most curious discovery we made
was that within five years of its first
running, in 1861, the Cup had acquired
a form and character that has remained
essentially unchanged ever since. Like
the Lesser Doxology, as it was in the
beginning, it is now, and apparently
ever shall be. The Melbourne Cup is as
firmly bound about with tradition as
any rite in England.
Australians cling doggedly to their
passion for the Cup even though they
have reduced racing to a second- or
third-rate sport. Non-racegoers prob-
ably do not realise how steep has been
the decline in racing’s popularity. On a
winter Saturday in Melbourne you will
find about 22,000 at Flemington, per-
haps a couple of thousand more if the
racing is at Caulfield or Moonee Valley.
On the same day there will be 150,000
watching the six games of Victorian
League football. On a warm summer
Saturday there are at least 20 times as
many people on the beaches of Port
Phillip Bay as at the racecourse.
The declining appeal of racing cer-
tainly had an influence on the Victorian
Government when it established the
Totalisator Agencies Board in 1961 to
dam the stream of money that was
flowing into the bank accounts of
illegal starting-price bookmakers. And
in Victoria, as in the other States
which have since set up the TAB,
legalised off-course betting has given
racing a temporary respite from its
financial worries; temporary, because
there are signs of cracks in the TAB
pot of gold.
JN Victoria, at least, there are indi-
cations that TAB turnover has just
about reached saturation point, and
that the amount of money racing can
expect to receive from this source will
stay pretty much at its present figure.
The difficulty is that expenditure will
go on I'ising unless all the usually
reliable economic pointers are aimed in
the wrong direction.
The obvious fact that racing has lost
its spectator appeal made the decision
to open Sandown Racecourse quite in-
explicable. Told very briefly, the story
of Sandown is this: for the best part
of 20 years, the MRC had depended on
the charity of the established clubs to
make their racecourses available in
rotation, but it hungered for its own
domain where it could be lord of the
manor and not just a tolerated guest.
The MRC bought a huge tract of
ground at Springvale, a suburb about
18 miles to the south-east of the heart
Baroness von Thyssen
of Melbourne, and there began to build
a racecourse, Sandown.
It was not very long before the
MRC had driven home to it the un-
palatable fact that its ambitions were
bigger than its bank balance. It then
sought succor from the wealthy Vic-
toria Amateur Turf Club, which has
never extended quite the degree of
filial respect to the Victoria Racing-
Club, which that father organisation
of racing in Victoria is entitled to
expect from its offspring. One attrac-
tion to the VATC of amalgamating
the MRC into its control was that it
would be allotted 29 race meetings a
year compared with the 16 the VRC
receives.
The spokesman for the VATC and
the MRC proffered a more altruistic
reason for the amalgamation: the
reason I mentioned above, that atten-
dances at racecourses have been de-
clining year by year. Their argument
ran that the new racecourse, named
Sandown, was located in an area which
has absorbed the major share of the
post-war population boom, and would
therefore attract new faces to racing.
After the hectic rush of curious
viewers to the first Sandown meeting,
racegoers new and old have shunned
the course in embarrassing numbers.
The most recent meetings at Sandown
have struggled to attract 15,000 to
18,000 spectators. The position has
become so bad that the VATC recently
obtained legislative sanction to transfer
all but half a dozen of Sandown’s meet-
ings to Caulfield.
It therefore follows that in any future
year far more people will go racing
at Caulfield than at Flemington. But
the Caulfield Cup will never challenge

the Melbourne Cup’s hold on popular
fancy. There were probably 90,000
at Flemington on Cup Day this year,
just as there were as long ago as 1880,
the year of Grand Flaneur, the only
Melbourne Cup winner to retire from
the turf undefeated.
Nor will any other race supplant
the Melbourne Cup. The rivalry be-
tween Sydney and Melbourne which
was born in the 1840 s, when the Port
Phillip District was trying to obtain
separation from New South Wales, has
an echo in the relations between the
AJC and the VRC.
The two principal clubs maintain
amicable relations, but the AJC makes
it plain, whenever the occasion arises,
that it is the senior racing club in Aus-
tralia. It was founded in 1842, 22 years
before the VRC was formed by dissi-
dent elements of the existing racing
clubs in Victoria. But a happy accident
of geography gave the VRC and the
race it inherited from its predecessors,
the Melbourne Cup, first place in the
sporting life of the Australian colonies.
Because Melbourne was the most
central of the capital cities, it was the
popular meeting-place of the ruling
elements from the colonies, and its Cup
Week quickly became the social
occasion of the Australian year. While
the AJC would dearly love to make
the Sydney Cup Australia’s premier
race, it has long since accepted the im-
possibility of making up the leeway
which the Melbourne race gained in
the 19th century.
The VRC is so confident of the Mel-
bourne Cup’s continuing appeal that
this year, for the first time, it will put
a loading on its normal admission
prices; and, in even greater defiance of
established procedure, it will charge
women the same price as men.
Racing is one of the few forms of
entertainment which admit women at a
concession price. Last year it cost men
the equivalent of $1.55 to see the Mel-
bourne Cup, but women were admitted
for 80 cents. This year men and women
will both have to pay $2.
The Melbourne Cup has never
looked like losing the eclat which social
patronage gave it in its formative years
when the competition for the sketcher’s
pencil was so intense that one lady
sewed mint-fresh sovereigns on every
square inch of her gown.
Last year some people were in-
genuous enough to believe that the ad-
mission of a mini-skirted young English-
woman, Miss Jean Shrimpton, to the
members’ reserve had devastated the
century-old dress traditions of Cup
Week. But in the salons of Toorak,
South Yarra, and Collins Street, where
more business is transacted in the six
weeks prior to Cup Day than in all
the rest of the year, there was a com-
plete absence of flap over Miss Shrimp-
ton’s possible influence.
Their judgment has been proved
right by the decision of the Du Pont
organisation, which brought The
Shrimp to Melbourne in 1965, to en-
trust the advocacy of synthetic fibres
this year to Baroness Fiona Von
Thyssen, as high a priestess of haute
couture as the fashion world can
exhibit.
The association of high fashion with
the Melbourne Cup had its origin in
the fertile brain of a gentleman named
Tom Colebrook. Originally brought to
Melbourne from Sydney by the VRC
in 1958 to organise a legal exchange of
betting odds between interstate race-
courses, he was asked to assist with the
promotion of the Melbourne Cup cen-
tenary meeting in 1960.
He is a man with a great deal of
native commonsense, as well as excep-
tional business acumen, and although a
Sydneysider he quickly realised that
the social aspect the snob appeal,
if you like of the Melbourne Cup
was the thing above all others that set
it aside from any other Australian race
meeting. He, as a consequence, devised
the Fashions in the Field contest to
make capital of the elaborate standard
of dress which is the hallmark of Cup
Week in Melbourne.
prestige and haute-couture
dressing are not the only unchang-
ing backgrounds to the Melbourne Cup.
Despite the vagaries of Melbourne’s
spring weather (and very often the
first Tuesday in Melbourne’s November
is perishing cold) the picnics in the
members’ reserve go on virtually un-
changed from year to year. These
alfresco parties are conducted all over
the considerable area set aside for mem-
bers’ cars, but there is an elite section
just behind the Birdcage in which a
member has to pay ten dollars to park
his car. Here, more than anywhere
else, one sees liveried chauffeurs doing
the same attentive jobs that coachmen
did in the days of fours-in-hand: pass-
ing around the chicken-and-ham colla-
tions, pouring the champagne. This
year, in addition, there was a Mem-
bers’ Smorgasbord Luncheon in a
marquee in the Birdcage.
But though all its background
elements popular appeal, social
patronage, elaborate dressing, picnic
parties remain constant, there is
another unchanging aspect of Cup
Week which is far more important.
This week at Flemington brings to-
gether the best horses in Australasia.
Except for the Melbourne Cup itself,
the result of which is always difficult
to forecast, the Cup Week racing at
Flemington holds only limited appeal
for the regular punter. In most of the
main events the classic Derby for
colts and Oaks for fillies, the two-year-
old and weight-for-age events the
likely winner is usually equally obvious
to bookmakers and punters, and these
races offer no opportunity to get rich
quick. But to anybody with a real love
of a quality thoroughbred, the spectacle
of the best horses in the land competing
on equal terms is a rare pleasure; and
there is the added advantage of renew-
ing friendships with mates from inter-
state and up country who rarely come
to town.

25 OVERSEAS
AWARDS TO
GRAMP’S
ORLANDO
WINES
Twenty-five Orlando Wines entries in
the 1966 International Wine Fair at
Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, have achieved 25
medals 14 gold and 11 silver. We
have listed some of these wines below,
and commend them for special con-
sideration by all wine lovers.
ORLANDO
MIAMBA CLARET
A medium to full Claret with a pleasing
bouquet and fruity palate, balanced with
a soft and appealing Tannin finish.
Miamba Claret, which was awarded a
Gold MedaL is vintaged from Hermitage
and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown at
Orlando’s famous Miamba Vineyard in
South Australia’s fertile Lyndoch Valley.
The delightful colour, bouquet and astrin-
gency is obtained by careful control of
the fermentation on the grape skins.
Immediately after fermentation, the wine
is aged in imported French Oak Casks to
develop its finest qualities.
BAROSSA
LIQUEUR BRANDY
This fine old, matured liqueur Brandy is
carefully distilled from selected wine
made from Blanquette grapes grown in
the Barossa Valley.
It was aged for many years in imported
Oak Casks, from which it has derived
its mellowness and distinctive bouquet.
Orlando Barossa Liqueur Brandy has also
been a Gold Medal winner in the Aged
Brandy Class at Australian Wine Shows,
as well as being awarded a Gold Medal
at Ljubljana.
1961 BAROSSA
WHITE BURGUNDY
This wine is produced mainly from the
Trebbiano grape, which Orlando planted
extensively in 1954 after prolonged ex-
periments on a smaller scale. The Treb-
biano grape has a very strong bouquet,
and to achieve a perfect balance it is
blended with the more delicate Madeira
grape during vintage. The 1963 vintage
of this wine achieved a Silver Medal at
Ljubljana. The 1961 vintage which we
now recommend for immediate enjoy-
ment, has also been a prize winner in
Australia. It was matured in 500 gallon
oak casks for 18 months, and then
bottled.
ORLANDO
BAROSSA FINO SHERRY
This pale, fairly dry, delicate Flor Sherry
was vintaged from well ripened Pedro,
Palomino, and White Hermitage grapes,
grown in ' the century old Orlando
Vineyards in the Barossa Valley.
After fermentation and clarifying, the
wine was seeded and kept on flor for
two years, then carefully blended with a
very old sweet Amontillado. The sherry
was then allowed to marry and age for a
period in oak casks, thus producing an
appetizer wine of outstanding bouquet
and flavour.
Barossa Fino, which was awarded a Silver
Medal at Ljubljana, has been a consistent
award winner at Wine Shows.

Lock, Stock, and Barrel-boots
The New Romantic Look
WHAT Mr. Charles Lloyd Jones
could not import to his Italian
Fortnight at David Jones’ was
authentic smell.
Over in the men’s store at Market
Street the aroma of Magic Moments
biscuits seemed stronger, if anything,
and not very conducive to the delicate
business of wooing Australian men away
from their conservative dress to the
avant garde Italian clothes of Brioni.
However, the sight of Mr. Brioni’s New
Romantic Look walking up and down
the catwalk did stop a fair number of
men in their tracks, and this is not
surprising, because Mr. Brioni had re-
turned to the 18th-century, lock, stock,
and barrel-boots.
The designer, known throughout the
rag-trade as the Dior of men’s fashion,
sat stoically through the parade check-
ing his address book. He wore a 20th-
century suit with lots of saddle-stitching,
and all his pockets were on the outside.
He had trouble with his figure, he
said, and pockets on the inside would
not help matters. He thought Australian
men’s dress sense was awful. Their
shoes were too pointed, their colors too
dark, which was all too ridiculous when
the climate here was so like Italy’s.
Mr. Jim Crawford, D.J.’s Merchan-
dising Controller, arrived wearing a
bright Brioni striped tie with his con-
servative grey suit. And why shouldn’t
Australian men tie cravats like Brioni?
He thought it not impossible that this
New Romantic Way with neckwear
would catch on. If Carnaby Street could
catch on, there was hope for this, too.
“I will show you,” he said, and com-
manded a young assistant to demon-
strate with a Brioni cravat. It did not
work. A senior gentleman was brought
forth. It still did not work. “We will

for that remark alone.
We had a little talk with Emilio
Pucci in his office off Hairdressing. As
far as he was concerned, he said, the
clothes he showed meant nothing to
him now, with the exception of one
dress that had taken him seventeen
years and three hundred yards of gold
silk and lame jersey to make. It came
from his sketchbook back home of Un-
makeable Dresses and was the Grand-
daddy of all dresses, the one that will
be copied for years to come. “I
imagined a naked woman running in a
field with a piece of gossamer in front
of her. It folds round her and moves
in whirls with her, and now I have
achieved a dress with sexability that
will fit anybody. Would it amuse you
to try it on?”

pointless anyway. Mr. Brioni said the

DAPHNE GUINNESS
WINE OF THE MONTH
All Alone, Just One Alone
THE wine grape
overseas that
produces a
top-quality table
wine will almost
certainly do the
same here. Witness
Rhine Riesling,
Cabernet Sauvig-
non, Trami n e r,
Pinot Blanc, Pinot
Noir, Shiraz, and so
on. Even some
grapes, used traditionally to make cer-
tain styles in other lands, blossom forth
in this land of Milk and Honey Boards
to produce fine table wines. And there
are still other examples of grapes which
don’t do very much in their respective
countries of origin at all, yet really
amount to something in Australia.
Such a one is the Blanquette, or Mau-
zac, which comes from the South of
France. There it is blended with Clair-
ette Blanche to make a sweet sparkling
ulterior-motive wine of quite definite
flavor and character but no distinction
whatsoever. A bit of a wet Blanquette,
in fact. Wfiat is more, it isn’t entirely
persona grappa here, for some South
Australian makers consider what little
Blanquette they have neither a, nor of,
great import.
Yet in the Hunter River Valley, in
that strange little pocket of wine coun-
try that claims so many prizes and so
much acclaim from such limited pro-
duction (far less than one percent of
our total), the Blanquette grape pro-
duces something that is quite unique
and quite delightful.
JTROM the various examples comes
the November Wine-of-the-Month,
Penfolds Blanquette Bin 700 1965.
Not that the year is all that import-
ant, for this is a repetitive bin number
that you will see, provided the seasons
are kind, next year and the year after.
There is not much of this grape
variety in the Hunter, and Penfolds
have most of it, about forty acres bear-
ing. Much of this -is part of the old
H.V.D. vineyard, from which once upon
a time the wine was undoubtedly used
for distillation. Fortunately Penfolds
took it over about twenty years ago, and
fortunately we now understand our wine
a lot better!
The Blanquette grape is oval shaped,
medium sized, tightly bunched, and
yields up to two and a half tons per
acre, which isn’t bad for the Hunter. I
first came in contact with the wine
made from it five or six years ago.
Though I thought it quite delicate and
with a specific flavor appeal, it seemed
rather hard. I felt it needed consider-
able bottle age to show at its best.
Then in 1963 I can remember tast-
ing a much more fragrant, aromatic,
softer, lighter wine that had terrific ap-
peal. I always thought this resulted
from the inception of controlled fer-
mentation, but Perc McGuigan, tfye
maker at Dalwood, says it’s more likely
due to the better seasons and different
time of picking. And don’t forget the
seasons have been successively better
from the good one of ’63, culminating
in a magnificent one this year. From
good to best! Escalating vintages!
But back to the ’65. A great year,
with the whites full flavored and soft,
and both these qualities displayed in
the Bin 700.
The color is a fresh straw-yellow
with a hint of green. The nose full in
volume and rich in bouquet, with a
strong varietal character evident. Yes,
you say, but what does it smell like?
Well I don’t kno\y. I’ve given up try-
ing to pigeonhole smells. A friend of
mine is very good at this sort of thing.
“Ah!” he says. “This is a corned beef
fat nose.” Or, “This has that hint of
freshly cut grass.” I’m afraid I can’t
help in such a way. To me the wine
smelled like a blanquette wine, and I
like it!
But you do get that lovely feeling in
your uvula? I know, I know. Quite,
Apparently it’s that sensitive bit where
the air passages behind the nose strike
the soft palate. Mine definitely responds.
Loads of flavor on the tongue, yet
no coarseness or flabbiness. In fact,
it’s delicate and soft with a gentle acid
fiflish. By this I mean the finish has
a quiet, prolonged cleanness to it rather
than the more familiar crisp ting of
other wines. If you want to classify
the wine I suppose you could call it
a White Burgundy/Dry Graves cross.
In fact, it’s a unique wine of Australia.
I brooded over the wine alongside a_
couple of others' for the purpose of this
exercise. I had been given a bottle of
the new Wybong Blanquette from Pen-
folds, I Bought a bottle of the 700, ancf
brought up fro,m my cellar an older
wine, the 1959 Blanquette Bin 330. The
Wybong wine was of deeper color with_
a more golden hue and didn’t seenx
quite so delicate as the 700. Nor was
the flavor quite as pronounced. The
330 was a ripe old Hunter, full flavored
and rich, with a pronounced varietal
character that seemed quite oily to me.
A good wine, but lacking the finesse-
of the 700.
Just a word of warning. If you do-
try this wine, give it some thought. Itr
has such obvious appealing qualities
and is such easy drinking that you may
be too easily seduced. There are lots
of different nuances and complexities
to it that appear in stages, and it’s-
worth while to look for them.

Caltex Astron is the world’s
most advanced commercial motor fuel.
It has a unique combination of
qualities possessed by no other gasoline.
Astron, developed by Caltex Central
Laboratories in Holland, keeps your engine clean,
protected and operating at full efficiency
for longer than is possible
on other petrols.


motor fuel
The development of Caltex Astron began right in the engines of cars like yours and dozens of other well
known makes. Caltex scientists analysed the fuel needs of today’s driving. Then they developed Astron to
provide peak performance in all cars under all operating conditions. This quality is what makes Caltex
Astron different from other gasolines.
Caltex Astron keeps fuel and power systems in “go” condition, prolonging engine life and saving main-
tenance costs. Here’s how:
CALTEX ASTRON CLEANS AND
PROTECTS FUEL SYSTEMS
1. Astron protection begins before you buy it. Chemical
reaction with certain metals found in storage and dis-
tribution systems can cause deterioration of ordinary
fuels. Caltex Astron contains a special metal deactiva-
tor to prevent such deterioration.
2. Astron protection of your fuel system starts in your
tank. Astron coats the walls of the tank with a thin
molecular film to prevent rust and corrosion. By using
Astron you avoid rust blockages in fuel lines, pump,
filter and carburettor.
3. Astron keeps carburettor throat and jets free from
gummy deposits that can form with other petrols. These
deposits cause stalling, uneven slow running and fuel
wastage. If deposits have formed Astron's detergent
action will clean them out and prevent them forming
again. This action is so effective you will feel power
coming back within 2,000 miles of switching to Astron.
4. Astron's balanced formula prevents vapour-lock
stalling your engine in summer. It also prevents car-
burettor icing in winter.
5. Astron prevents formation of zinc carbonate in car-
burettors a type of corrosion that affects the carbur-
ettor alloy.
Caltex Astron keeps fuel systems in “go”
condition
CALTEX ASTRON RENEWS AND
MAINTAINS POWER SYSTEMS
1. Astron chemically modifies combustion chamber
deposits so they will not become incandescent and
cause pre-ignition or surface ignition. Surface ignition
is a silent thief of your engine power. It causes faulty
combustion, loss of power and robs you of fuel econ-
omy. Surface ignition is also responsible for more
rapid engine wear and in some instances leads to ex-
tensive piston damage.
2. Astron treats deposits on spark plugs, greatly re-
ducing their conductivity, eliminating power-wasting,
spark leakages and misfiring. Astron keeps spark plugs
healthy, more than doubling efficient plug life.
3. Astron’s formulation ensures controlled burning of
the combustion charge so thatfull power and therefore
best possible economy of operation is achieved.
4. Astron’s composition is so balanced to deliver the
right performance for every situation

* Fast warm-up and acceleration

All airlines have pilots. So why be so proud of ours? Because we know them
right from their very first plane ride. Where other airlines buy pilots,
we train them. From scratch. Even though it takes seven of our 56 plane fleet
to do it. And puts our senior captains into the instructor's seat.
And keeps our graduate pilots in the co-pilot’s seat. For a year at least.
And logs each of our captains 10,000 hours or more, before they ever see
the flight deck of a DCB. And still they could be 5,000 hours away
from the controls. Of course, they do make the most experienced flight
engineers, navigators and first officers in the business, which is what
we are after. Exactly. But perhaps you think we’re a little extreme.
(Especially if you know how many pilots we lose to other airlines who buy
and don’t train I) But to us it's worth it. Because it gives us an edge.
A little bit extra to offer all along the line. Even if it’s up front,

The Man From the BBC
WHEN Humphrey Fisher explained
his agnostic views on a radio pro-
gram recently, friends rang and
congratulated him on handling a “diffi-
cult situation” cleverly.
It would be more accurate to say that
the fourth son of Lord Fisher, former
Archbishop of Canterbury, finds an
afternoon’s sailing far more difficult a
situation to handle than declaring into
a microphone his doubt of God’s exis-
tence.
Humphrey Fisher is 41, and would
rather not be reminded of the fact. He
is BBC representative for Australia and
New Zealand and lives in some
opulence with his wife, Diana, in a
Point Piper flat overlooking Sydney
Humphrey Fisher
Harbor—a fact he attributes entirely
to his employer’s largesse.
It is one of nature’s jokes that the
son who most resembles his father
should be the one who least shares
his views. He sat one night watching
for the second time a face-to-face tele-
vision interview of Lord Fisher. It was
for no sentimental reason that he’d
switched on. He wanted to see as a
professional film producer if his father’s
performance was still as bad as it
seemed the first time round. “Oh, why
doesn’t he answer the questions?” he
said, irritated. “Why doesn’t he keep
to the point? They should never have
put it out.” .
Now, it’s hard for some people to
understand how an Archbishop’s son
could be agnostic. Friends with religious
tendencies call him a bit of a weird
bird,- and leave it at that. They might
talk about it for a bit, then go on to
the next thing. Strangers, however, do
their utmost to avoid the topic, but
they do look at him hard, hoping, one
supposes, to find visible evidence of his
attitude.
He and his father have had long
discussions about it, but there is no
animosity. Lord Fisher doesn’t try to
persuade his son to his view, neither is
he upset by his attitude “. . . except in
the sense that any father would be with
a child who didn’t believe in what, after
all, amounts to his life’s work.” Any-
way, he says, he is always willing to
listen to fresh evidence, for who knows
what is going on around us? “I am
not an atheist, and would never be so
categorical as to say ‘There is no God.’
On the other hand, I don’t know that
there is one and until someone gives
me sufficient proof then I must be an
I-Don’t-Know-Man when it comes to
religion.”
In other things he is much more of a
Do-Know man. He knows, for instance,
that his dislike of sailing makes him,
in the eyes of friends who do like sail-
ing, a bit of an odd-ball. Ditto tennis
and skiing and any of the other “re-
quired” social sporting activities. His
only real enthusiasm is golf. He enjoys
music, dislikes pop noise, and can sit for
hours watching television. This so in-
furiated his wife, Diana, last winter
that he was moved to say, “All right,
get me some wool and I’ll knit a
sweater,” and he now wears the end
product of that season’s viewing a
white, long-sleeved sweater for more
casual engagements. This knitting, he
says, is a talent shared by all six Fisher
sons and was fostered by their mother
as a worthwhile childhood occupation.
“I have always been a dissenter,” he
said, “and I suppose I have always
enjoyed being one. If one can pinpoint
the reason why I should have turned
out differently to the rest of my family,
it may be the war that interrupted my
formative years. I know that at Oxford,
where presumably I was sent to become
a teacher, I suddenly got bored with
all the books and spent all my time
watching films. The production side
of it so fascinated me I wanted to earn
my living in no other way.”
And so, after years of more or less
gracious living via public school (Rep-
ton), the army (officer), home (Lam-
beth Palace), he got work as tea-boy
at Pinewood Studios for £4 a week.
Jack Lee, brother of poet Laurie,
directed his first film and they are still
close friends in Sydney. Then came
seven months’ unemployment, but with
the aid of his Lambeth Palace address
and putting Archbishop of Canterbury
as father, he “somehow” got short-
listed for BBC producer. “At least I’ve
never suffered any doubts, as my
brothers may have, that I’d been em-
ployed in the hope that some of
father’s talents would come through.
They’re all in the accepted professions
law, medicine, church, teaching. To
my knowledge, Father wouldn’t know
one end of a television camera from
another.”
Now there are no cameras for
Humphrey Fisher. He is a well-paid
senior executive who works behind a
desk in an office with a traditional bar,
which he keeps locked until noon, and
on the walls hang traditional His and
Her royal photographs. He sees
himself as a BBC ambassador and his
office and staff of eight as a sort af
embassy. He is not too happy talking
about BBC affairs (“I want to keep my
job”), but agrees that when he arrived
two years ago relations between the
ABC and BBC were tricky though it
would be making too much of the situ-
ation to say they were not cordial. “We
had our professional frictions. These,
after all, are bound to happen when
you’ve got two such enormous organ-
isations working so similarly. Each one
expects the other to fall in line, but
this,” with a Lord Fisher-ish pursing of
the lips, “isn’t necessarily possible.”
Things are now more pleasant. Both
organisations are busy co-producing
programs, and BBC directors are com-
ing out in increasing numbers to sample
first-hand the pleasures and joys of
Australian life. Back in London,
Humphrey Fisher’s old department are
placing bets on whether he will ever
want to leave Sydney. So far, it’s a
50-50 chance. He is, however, return-
ing in April for his parents’ Golden
Wedding.
Meanwhile, he has received a letter
from the BBC asking for his bi-annual
report. “They ask for HIGHLIGHTS
ONLY PLEASE, and underline it eight
times.” He has written 6000 words and
knows all they will finally say in Lon-
don is: “Australia Satisfactory.”

NO doubt in an attempt to guide

A typed sheet headed “What the

it sets out with impressive confidence

“This,” says the sheet, “includes
naturally characterisation, a very
important factor. Audibility of speech,
variation in tone, emphasis, gesture,
and movement will also be closely
watched.” The memories of David
Lean’s film version intruded here.
After Charles Laughton, Sydney Cona-

seemed incongruously tall after John

as Brenda De Banzie. But their tonal

“This includes . . . interpretation of

30.000 TONS OF
COAL A DAY!
At Morwell Victoria, the longest single-flight,
high-speed conveyor system in Australia is
carrying brown coal from the open cut to Hazel-
wood Power Station, If miles away. Plans for the
conveyor system were adopted by the State
Electricity Commission Victoria after a thorough
investigation of all means of transporting coal
over such a distance.
Built to exacting specifications by Goodyear
Tyre and Rubber Co. (Australia) Ltd., the two
steel cable conveyors operate at a speed of 1050
feet a minute carrying 2000 tons of coal an hour.
The belts are 7244 feet and 8560 feet long, 48
inches wide, approximately f inch thick and con-
sist entirely of rubber and 500 miles of steel
cables. Minimum breaking strength is 423,000
pounds. The structure of the belt allows the cable
maximum lateral movement. There is no tearing
under impact!
The seven miles of Goodyear belting used on
the two mainlines for Hazelwood is another
example of the numerous advantages of steel
cable belting. It has an extremely high tensile
strength. Its design makes it trough perfectly and
have the best impact resistance of any belt con-
struction. Stretching and elongation is negligible
so short take up lengths are possible.
If you have a project where you need conveyor
belting remember Goodyear conveyor belting. It’s
the best. Contact the Goodyear technical man at
the Goodyear branch in y° ur state.

tions are prompted by a call in “Art
and Artists,” a new London magazine
with one toe in the incomprehensible,
lunatic lands of art, that we need auto-
destructive criticism to accompany
auto-destructive art. Tingueley, whose
sculpture destroyed itself in the court-
yard of New York’s MOMA in 1960,
says that art that aims at permanence
kills life, which itself is unpredictable,
unclassifiable, destructible: “Only fear
of death makes us want to stop life, to
fix it impossibly for ever.”
An air of destruction envelops
Clune’s at present: they have had a
fire and it would be a grim thought to
imagine that a band of art-arsonists had
come to believe in the auto-destructive
gallery. Dust filters, timber clumps into
the yard, and a yellowish pool lies
beneath a table as one looks at Mike
Brown’s sculptures, mainly junk from
the toolshed and the kitchen: waifs,
as it were, from the storm of destruc-
tion above; no slabs of timber, burst
boilers, or rusted chains, but discarded
domestic trivia. A shoe, plastic stars,
and detergent bottles, an oyster bottle,
empty jam tins, and bottle tops are
lassoed and tied in a crisp maze of wire.
Most junk sculpture broods symbolic-
ally about decay, but these are lightly
ironical about the fragile impermanence
of life, playful pieces as though Cedric
Flower had turned to sculpture.
Jupiter Fly Trap retains some of
Brown’s former eccentric imagination
and iconoclasm: one side of an art-
nouveau-ish painted sheet of tin is
studded with nails, point outwards, and
a delicate flower, with a golden bell for
cheerful bud, shoots aloft. They are
rococo pieces; minor amusements, a
long way from the kite, lambasting
local painters and critics, that he flew
once at the Young Contemporaries.
Castigated by critics and curtailed by
courts, his paintings have no four-letter
words, indeed, few at all.
Potluck he calls two, and they are
a mixture: a concave board is pierced
by paint-spattered brooms; others toss
in a kaleidoscopic turmoil of bright
clouds and clear cut geometry as
though the angular kandinsky had run
into the surf of a true Red Sea_ Best
is the grey, black, and white Tribula-
tions of the Artist, which, with its
staccato .movements, broken forms, and
sudden twitches, is like a rioting tapa
cloth. A concealed rhythm saves it
from chaos; rendered in modestly un-
heroic hues, it does look like the
symbolic syndrome of the troubled
artist, who, in this only moderately
successful show, is looking more at his
own life than at the superficial follies-
of others.
Life as surface now engages Louis
James. For some time he presented
life as bejewelled and romantic; dark
areas of blue once opened to reveal
clustered paint like gems; red lands
under black, velvet skies were encrusted
with richness or roamed by slowly
curving roads; life was a mysterious
carnival, a strange, tumultuous pro-
cession of hands, heads, banners, and
whatnot. He has, to stretch a point,
changed Magnasco for Guardi and
Fragonard, the embellished baroque for
the rustling, rococo swish of summer
dresses.
The paint is now almost flat, impasto-
smoothed and romantic mists dissolved.
It is Sydney in spring and summer;
in Waiting in the Sun the light suffuses
and melts the fragile figures into happy

James is more concerned with the
juxtaposition of areas like bouquets
with slabs like the side of an iron
tank, to be too involved with social
comment; his excellent drawings are
more desperate, the people driven as
much by anxiety as traffic signs, and
in For Those Who Trust the Stars,
a row of vague heads across the top
do indicate the woolly aspirations of
the masses, but like Brown he is a
mild commentator. James, however,
has attained a fluency and sophistica-
tion rare in Australia; it could slip
into suavity but at present it is fine,

FILMS
Among Friends
The Wrong Box. Director, Bryan Forbes.
The Liquidator. Director, Jack Cardiff.
BRYAN FORBES probably couldn’t
turn out a completely valueless
film even in an off moment. “The
Wrong Box” offers so much diversion
that I found it easy to forgive its lack
of central purpose, its repetitions—the
j°ke about the band, for instance, was
hardly worth making even once, let
alone three times and its occasional
lapses into modish affectation such as
those silent-film captions! “Tom Jones”
has much to answer for.
It has been described (perhaps not by
Forbes to do him justice) by that
overworked term “black comedy,” and
certainly it jests about death, corpses,
and murder; but its prevailing tone is
affably sunny. It is based on Steven-
son’s comic novel (which wasn’t
“black,” either), but RLS gets lost in
the shuffle very early on, as it becomes
clear that Forbes’ chief aim is to amuse
himself and just about any of his
showbusiness pals who want to gqt
into the act. Fortunately, he’s got some
remarkably talented friends, and there
is enough fun going on for the audience
t 0 have a generous share.
Among the best moments are Peter
Sellers’ scenes as a seedy, ailurophile
doctor; an agonisingly funny sequence
in which John Mills, thankfully escap-
ing from his Terribly-Decent-Chap
type-casting, attempts fratricide with
exuberant inefficiency; a lyrical and
charming love scene in slow-motion
between Michael Caine and Nannette
Newman camera trickery is
thoroughly justified here. Perhaps best
of all is Wilfred Lawson’s appear-
ances as an unbelievably mouldy re-
tainer crumbling under the accumu-
lation of years and booze.
Spy spoofs continue to flood the mar-
ket, and some day soon someone’s
going to be left holding the bag, but
“The Liquidator” is a most acceptable
comedy-thriller. Rod Taylor is likable
and funny as a bumbling fellow who,
having given a totally false impression
of deadly efficiency, finds himself hired
by British Intelligence as a ruthless
killer. The dialogue is smart and amus-
ing, but former photographer Jack
Cardiff lets his lively and skittish
camera tell most of the story; the very
funny sequence involving that oddly
sinister comedian Eric Sykes is pre-
sented almost entirely in visual terms.

Authenticity
New Sydney Woodwind Quintet. Cell
Block Theatre, Sydney.
HOW heartening it is to see that
the members of the New Sydney
Wind Quintet still enjoy per-
forming as much as they did in the
earlier recitals of their brief career!
This welcome freshness, always
tempered with accurate and well-
disciplined playing, helped unify the
Quintet’s realisation of interpretive
problems and in doing so overcame the
clashes in texture which so often under-
mine the effectiveness of wind ensemble
instrumentation.
Hindemith’s “Kleine Kammermusik”
for wind quintet is a charming excur-
sion in colloquial Gebrauchsmusik. The
NSWQ relished in its rhythmic cliches,
exaggerating the phrasing to an almost
satiric degree.. Clarinettist Donald West-
lake, employing his mellowest tone at
every possible opportunity, was very
much the leader of this attractively
humorous trend in the performance.
Almost tripled in number, the Quin-
tet returned after interval to lead what
almost amounted to the entire Sydney
Symphony Orchestra wind section in
the first “authentic” performance of
the Mozart Serenade No. 10 (K 361)
for thirteen, wind instruments. The
authenticity of the performance rested
on the use of the original basset horns
in place of the customary second
clarinet substitutes.
Under the studied direction of
Neville Amadio, this hefty group of
wind musicians produced what could
truly be described as a unique semi-
orchestral sound. The occasional solo
passages for basset horn gave little indi-
cation of their full range, but, coupled
with the clarinets and brace of french
horns, they evoked what must have
been the typical texture of eighteenth-
century outdoor music.

McWilliam’s Lexia, recently intro-
duced to the Australian market, is a
distinctive, dry white table wine
which could not be exhibited in any
Australian Wine show, because there
was. no classification for this new
variety.
McWilliam’s, therefore, entered it
overseas, and are justifiably proud of
receiving a top' Gold Medal award.
In the short time it has been available,
this wine has received considerable
acclaim. McWilliam’s Lexia is made
from the grape variety know as Lexia,
and was produced at McWilliam’s
Robinvale Winery in Victoria.
During fermentation the temperature
was maintained below 55° F., and
this has helped to retain in the wine
a very powerful aroma of the grape,
as well as a tremendous volume of
flavour. This light, dry white table
wine is an ideal accompaniment to
most foods, particularly seasoned fish
dishes, white meats and poultry.
Other successes at Ljubljana for
McWilliam’s included Gold Medals
for Cream Sherry; Private Bin 530
Claret; Mount Pleasant Sauterne; Dry
Friar Sherry; Sherry (fruity type);
Muscat; Mount Pleasant Hermitage;
Champagne and Brandy.

The Next Cliche You Hear Will Be...
AUSTRALIANS are always saying
that Australians don’t, or can’t,
communicate. That’s the only
time you’ll hear an Australian say any-
thing: when he says that Australians
can’t communicate. I used to say it,
too, but that was before I discovered
daytime radio. It’s all communicating
in there. All swing-a-dinging, ring-a-
dinging good old communicating nine
to six Monday thru’ Friday with special
repeats on Sunday of platitudes you
may have missed.
I tell you, if only industry went to
work with the same assiduity; Washing-
ton would be ringing us. It’s comfort-
ing for a lonely per-
son like myself to
know that no mat-
ter how lone I am;
how morose; I can,
merely by flicking
a knob, unleash such
a torrent, such an
instant catharsis of
TALK that would
have laid Dr. John-
son out on his great
dumb ear. Stand
back from that
WIRELESS or
you’ll have your
fool head communi-
cated right off!!
They never stop,
these filibusters of
the air; not for
breath and cer-
tainly never for a
fresh train of
thought. When one speaker momen-
tarily croaks, then a sprightly splash
of theme (the only music you get on
radio these days) heralds another spry
spruiker to the hot and by now sweaty
microphone. Listening to them on their
galloping marathon one is reminded of
that Great American Talker to Some
Purpose, Mort Sahl, when he observed,
on the subject of radio: “It’s like a
kind of Hindu Wheel of Life. You
start to get the feeling that you should
ring up these people and ask permis-
sion to go out and eat.”
Many of the oracles appear in mixed
doubles and here it’s intriguing to
observe what happens to the sex. Not
SEX. They’re much too busy com-
municating for that kind of nonsense
but, rather, to a gradual shifting over
and under of the gender characteristics.
Listen long enough and you will detect
that the male partner becomes passive;
even his voice rises an octave or so,
while the woman becomes gruffer, more
aggressive and starts dictating the
trends in conversation. Maybe this is
true in any marriage; I don’t know,
I’ve never stayed around long enough
to find out.
And in radio I know not whether it
is simply because woman is, by her
nature, more suited to these gabfests or
that the man just gets bored and goes
away, reverting to a normal apathetic
Australian prototype. Whatever the
reason, radio remains a woman’s
Ray Taylor
world. Just listening to it I feel I need
hormones. And IF I need hormones
then I know where to get them. Radio.
They’ll put you on to anything. What-
ever your need ring up Radio and
you’ll discover the true facts about
God, Souffles, Vietnam, the Lavatory,
Poodles, the Church of England,
Liquidity, Dandruff, the Theatre, Foot-
ball, and Face Lifts.
Radio has contrived a metamor-
phosis: it is now the Encyclopedia
Britannica in a plastic case. Miss
Lonelyhearts with knobs on. Got tnari-
tal problems? Ring the station.
“Hello? This Radio 2AZ? Oh, good
afternoon, I won-
der if you can help
me. Every time I
ask my wife to
honor her connubial
obligations she
starts ringing up
radio stations . . .”
More than usual
unease takes over
whenever I hear
those anonymous
telephone treaties;
all couched in
Barry Humphries’
inflected euphem-
ism and all making
rather terrifying
assertions. The
other thirsty after-
noon I Was being
treated to a dia-
logue on alcoholism
and women kept
coming through on filter and saying
casually: “My husband is an alcoholic
and . . . blah blah blah.”
Now wait a minute there, Lilian
Roth. What are you saying? What
spells alcoholism to you doesn’t begin
to spell it to me. And vice versa. Take
a case. A bitter and frustrated wowser
on the outer edge of Doom is married
to this martyr of a man whose only
indulgence is a thimbleful of sherry
before dinner. Suddenly out of the
clear;' slightly blue ether there comes
this voice of accusation for all to hear
and enjoy. “Oh, listen. There she is
again. That poor Mrs. Riley. On about
her husband the alcoholic.” What the
hell is she sprawling around listening to
the radio for anyway? Surely she’d be
better employed hiding the empties?
Of course, for all I know, these
seekers of wisdom and truth are not
people at all. Not real, licence-paying
people anyway. It’s the switch girl with
a list of questions and a few assorted
voices. Carefully aimed so that the
oracles can get in a few good lines.
Maybe and this is a creepy thought
there’s nobody out this end at all.
Just me. Sitting wasting my time with
a grabbag of misinformation when I
should be getting on with my work.
You see, I’m writing this play. It’s all
about people who CAN communicate
and can’t stand it ! ! ! It’s called
“Who’s Afraid of Charmian Clift.”

Miss Murdoch’s Demons
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Time of the Angels. Iris Murdoch.
Chatto and Windus. $3.15.
ONCE upon a time there were two
girls called Muriel and Elizabeth.
They were cousins. Muriel was
dark and Elizabeth was fair and very
beautiful, just like a fairy princess.
though unfortunately she had
hurt her back and had to stay
inside all day playing with a
jig-saw puzzle. Elizabeth was
19 and Muriel 24. They lived
with Muriel’s father in a dark,
cold rectory in London next
door to a bombed Wren
church, only the spire of which
was still standing. Muriel’s
father was called Carel, and
he was a very strange man
who played with paper darts
and liked to listen to the
gramophone, especially to “Swan Lake.”
Three other people lived with them
Eugene Peshkov, a kind of servant
who had a little cell next to the boiler-
room, and his naughty son Leo; and
Pattie O’Driscoll, a West Indian ser-
vant.
The girls had an uncle called Mar-
cus, and he sometimes came to see
them, but Pattie wouldn’t let him in
the door. (One night, though, he fell
in through the coal cellar, and met his
brother, but he couldn’t see him
properly because all the lights were
out.) Marcus had a friend called Norah
Shadox-Brown, who was a rather fright-
ening, but very sensible, schoolteacher.
Then there was a very funny lady
called Mrs. Barlow, who kept on ring-
ing the front door bell, and wanting
to see the rector. But Pattie wouldn’t
let her in either. (One day she just
managed to squeeze into the hall and
leave a bunch of snowdrops.) Mostly,
though, she had to go away and walk
about in the snow. It is not a very
happy story, because no handsome
prince marries the beautiful princess,
and it snows most of the time, and some
very peculiar things happen. For
example, Eugene loses his icon, and
Carel gives Marcus a carrot in the
dark, which frightens him. People talk
about God a good deal.
If that reductio ad absurdam of the
ingedients of “The Time of the
Angels” is not quite fair to the book,
at least it makes clear that we are back
once more in what one can only call
“Murdoch country,” that peculiar
English enchanted ground of witches,
wizards, and fairies, and things that go
bump in the night. The solidly present
Dublin of Miss Murdoch’s last novel
“The Red and the Green,” was, it
seems, only a temporary resting-place.
For though the setting of “The Time
Iris Murdoch
of the Angels” is London, and though
we look out across the spires and domes
of the city, and peer through the snow
and fog at the littered river, and
though the winter cold seeps into the
rectory and defeats the English heat-
ing system, it is the world of nightmare
that we really inhabit for
most of the story.
Through the solid dark of
the rectory moves the diaboli-
cal figure of Carel in his cas-
sock, weaving his evil spells
into the lives of all. Maniac, or
devil, or both? For relief, or
contrast, we are allowed to
enter the limited, but cosy and
sensible, world of Norah
Shadox - Brown, who has
cherry cake and muffins for
tea in a room full of cheerful-
ness and warmth. Or we can walk into
Eugene’s tiny cell, and in doing so
walk back into the Russian past,
through the revolution, into refugee
camps, and see symbolised in his icon
the past and the faith he has lost. There
is variety enough and there are chilly
revelations for those who like them,
but what else?
Well, there is some portable
philosophy. Heidegger’s “Sein und Zeit”
is a member of the cast. Pattie trips
over it in Chapter 1, and there is a
long quotation from it about Dasein
and Death later in the novel. Marcus
is writing a book called “Morality in
a World Without God,” the argument
of which is very much influenced by
his relationship with his brother.
In fact, the title of Marcus’ book
is a convenient, if rather obvious,
device for drawing attention to what
the novel is supposed to be about. At
its centre is a problem in moral
philosophy. If God is dead, what hap-
pens to morality? Various answers
are given through the different charac-
ters in the novel. Eugene’s loss of faith
has left him little more than a hope-
less longing for innocence and happi-
ness. Pattie’s innocence is destroyed
and her life debased by misplaced faith
in Carel, who turns out to be false. To
Carel is given a destructively fatalistic
philosophy. If God is dead the angels,
who are terrible, are set free: “. . . We
are creatures of accident, operated by
forces we do not understand. Only
in the infliction of pain is the effect
so contained in the cause as to con-
vince of the existence of others.” So
Carel gives himself over to the pleasure
of making others suffer. He sells his
soul to the terrible angels, since good-
ness, with or without God, is, on his
argument, impossible to humans.
Marcus, disturbed in his own corn-
placency by Card’s arguments, is left
to ponder the question whether there
is an answer to him. “Was there noth-
ing which was both good and real?”
He comes no nearer an answer than
suggesting that “One’s got to learn
to live without the idea of the Good
being somehow One.” For Norah, on
the other hand, philosophical and theo-
logical disputes are irrelevant to
ordinary morality “I don’t see any
point in either affirming or denying
that the Good is One. I still ought to
pay my bills.” So Miss
snow-blanketed nightmare London, with
its odd inhabitants, is in reality the
setting for a philosophical debate about
religion and morality, guilt and respon-
sibility, crime, and punishment. The
characters enact a grotesque ballet,

weaving into the story threads of the
central argument.
It is all very ingenious and entirely
lacking in conviction. The miscalcula-
tions of “The Unicorn” and “The
Italian Girl” are back with us again.
Miss Murdoch’s chamber of horrors
provides the kind of setting in which
it is virtually impossible to take her
debate seriously. In this novel we have
what we have now come to expect
seduction, homosexuality, a particularly
nasty form of incest, and a suicide.
Good, toothsome meat this for the
jaded appetite, but without nourish-
ment. At the level of moral philosophy,
Miss Murdoch is providing her charac-
ters with vital issues to illustrate and
debate. It matters a great deal whether
ordinary morality is possible without
God; and precisely how loss of faith
affects human lives. But here there are
no human lives who matter in the
least.
Miss Murdoch makes her revelations
with a fine theatrical flourish to the
incest scene, for example, she has
clearly given devoted attention, and as
a spine-chiller it certainly succeeds.
But a journey through “The Time of
the Angels” is very like a ride on the
Ghost Train at Luna Park. Those
skeletons in cupboards, and those name-
less things that flap in your face in the
dark, and those screams of delighted
torture they’re all fearfully and
gruesomely jolly, but how in the world
are they supposed to engage our atten-
tion in human moral dilemmas? So far
as I am concerned, what happens to
Carel, Muriel, Elizabeth, or any other
members of the cast, is a matter of
complete indifference. I confess to a
slight feeling of regret at Pattie’s lost
innocence, but that is all.
Wilderness
Wandering in a wilderness of time,
Three decades down
And Who knows what’s to come
I hunger for a death-defying God
To lead me out
Behind a fiery cloud.
Surrounded by an undergrowth of hours,
Life’s trackless route
Cuts through the overhanging years,
A Godless, loveless waste,
Weedfilled and soured:
Deserted, stranded, lost.
My God, my God, have You forsaken me?
Given up the Ghost
And yielded to a timeless tree?

Sharp Disgust
By LES TANNER
Cartoons. Martin Sharp. Scripts Pty. Ltd.

the satirical vogue says here
that old men have grey beards, that
their faces are wrinkled, their eyes
purging thick amber and plum-tree
gum, and that they have a plentiful
lack of wit.”
Not a bad assessment of the satire
boom of the early 19605. The unfor-
tunate thing is that the obvious was
revolutionary then. It was important
to draw the Prime Minister’s gut
and not just his eyebrows. Cartoons
had become too polite and well man-
nered. I can remember an editorial
crisis in the days when “good taste”
reigned and, readers were “morons”
when the label over Menzies’ head was
changed from “Ming” to “Menzies”
and finally to an anguished “P.M.”
Well, the times they are always
a’changin’. And this book of cartoons
captures its times in a way that is quite
unique. If you want to know what the
swinging Australian liberal conscience
was exercised about in the 1960 s it is
all here.
Martin Sharp is a cartoonist of dis-
gust. He is like the Englishman
Scarfe; flesh revolts him, heads dangle
like old scrotums, not a bone anywhere.
He is very puritanical. Plis characters
don’t kiss, they press facial orifices to-
gether. His women don’t possess
breasts, they have norks. Why anyone
thought he was out to deprave or cor-
rupt I can’t imagine. He wants to
make your flesh creep.
The cartoon of Menzies and Calwell,
the two supreme oldies, is a brilliant
drawing, the cross-hatched lines finger
their way around the shapes with all
the clinical care of a bowel examina-
tion. The trouble with high-powered
disgust is that it gets a bit predictable
and boring. . . . “Look out, here
comes Martin, disgusted again” . . .
“Martin, why aren’t you disgusted
with me any more?” . . .‘"The dis-
gust has gone out of my life.” You
keep lapsing into good spirits and so
does Sharp. His girl with her baby
from the Tempe Tip, his topless nun,
“I was kicked by Simpson’s donkey,”
and “God save our gracious me” are
very funny jokes.
Those of us who tramped our shin-
ing white armor between the magistrate’s
court and the Sydney Quarter Sessions
Appeal Court in his defence obviously
went to the wrong place. We mis-
guidedly thought that we had helped
to establish that “the Gas Lash” and
“The word flashed round the arms”
were not obscene. But the highest court
of this land—Gordon and Gotch—has
ruled: neither appears in the book.
Martin Sharp accuses me of en-
couraging him. I’m glad I did.

The Agony of Greece
By DAVID MARTIN
Special Greek Number. The London
u ® ust ’ Alan Ross
MR. ALAN ROSS, who is not only
an editor but also a publisher
and interested in modem Greek
writing in both these capacities, has
now followed up his collage of Hellenic
material in two 1965 issues of the
“London Magazine” with some assorted
new pieces. Very rightly he does not
claim that, all taken together, what he’
offers us does more than scratch the
surface. Literary life, indeed the whole
of creative life, in Greece appears to
be still in a state of crisis, and the body
of good work is perhaps not exception-
ally large at present, but there is, of
course, much more of it than can be
collected in about 60 pages. It would
serve no purpose to number the poets
alone not to mention the others
who have not found inclusion, since the
list would be longer than the contents
pages of this and several other issues
combined.
Nikos Stangos, in his “Letter to
Athens,” bewails the aridity of his
country’s current intellectual climate,
the contempt in which the avant-
garde writers are held, and the unfair
way in which they are accused of being
either superannuated surrealists or sur-
realists out of touch with their native
reality. He notes that even Seferis (the
Nobel Prize winner), Elytis, and
Gatsos have become respected but un-
read in Greece, and how little they
seem to have produced in recent years.
He discusses the increasingly serious
problem of exilism, the get-rich-at-any-
cost mentality among the young, and
presents as truly hopeful only the
activity of the Pali the word means
“Again” group of artists and writers,
who are trying to establish not a new
school but a new and honest platform
for debate.
'J'HERE are, it is true, many taboos
now operating in Greek verse and
prose, if more in the latter, to judge
by what comparatively little is being
translated; taboos indirectly traceable
to the terrible spiritual and physical
sufferings of the war and, still more,
the indescribably ferocious civil war.
And there is another element, perhaps
complementary: the belated rise of a
middle class, a genuine petit bour-
geoisie in Athens, Salonika, and beyond.
French influence is waning, as American
is rising, notwithstanding that Kazant-
zakis and a few others have made their
homes in Paris. Greece has had trouble
after trouble since at least 191 L; the
war with Turkey, two world wars, mass
transplantation of populations, the
Metaxas dictatorship, and civil war
. . . and its aftermath. Small wonder
that, despite the new relative and not
too broadly based prosperity, optimism
is at a discount. But if there are taboos
and moral self-denial ordinances, they
are not all-embracing: for example, a
powerful erotic element has come into
Greek writing, possibly under the in-
fluence of the Greek cinema, which is
both quantitatively and qualitatively
new.
Of this trend, Andreas Embiricos’
unpublished novel, “The Great
Eastern,” is supposed to be an out-
standing example. This number con-
tains a segment of the same writer’s
book (to call it a novel would, I un-
derstand, not be correct) “Amour
Amour.” Vividly autobiographical in
flavor, it reads like part of a preface
or part of an elucidation, and has much
of the feeling of flux and spaciousness
for which Embiricos, who has passed
through more metamorphoses than most
men do in several lives, is noted. It
takes us to the Crimea, his mother’s

FREEDOM IN AUSTRALIA
by Enid Campbell and Harry Whitmore
This study of present-day Australian law as it relates to the freedom of the individual
is in many ways a disturbing one; and it leaves no doubt that a book of this kind
—one that is influenced by respect both for individual freedom and for the rule of
the law—was needed.

home. Amour refers to love . . . and
to a river.
But to me more impressive and more
unexpected is the sketch or story by
Costas T'achtsis, “The Alibi,” in which
he writes of a boyhood holiday in a
tobacco workers’ camp, his attempted
seduction of a girl of twelve, and the
subtle after-echoes of these happenings
across the bitter years. This is a re-
markable little excursion into a world
of muted suffering and finely trans-
lated.
Among the reproductions, one in
particular caught my attention for its
symbolic force. “Two Aspects of One
Picture,” by Nikos Engonopoulos, re-
lates two figures, one male and one
female, • with the Acropolis distantly
in the background. Actually there are
two pictures, one in which the woman,
a faceless lady in Edwardian attire, is
situated to the right, and another in
which she is situated to the left of the
man who is a German soldier, or
rather a skeleton with a steel helmet,
outside a sentry box. I can only feel
that these paintings in their, fierce but
stylised realism tell us something about
the sad fate of Greece. What exactly it
is I do not know, but it moves me.
Bath-House
Girl
By NANCY KEESING
A Maid From Heaven. Kenneth Greville.
Macmillan. $3.
HOW is one to classify “A Maid
From Heaven”? It is too well
written, too honestly felt, too
crusading to be described in the some-
what disparaging term “library fiction.”
But on the other hand it simply can-
not be rated a. successful serious novel
about the White Australia Policy.
The tale is the first-person narra-
tion of an Australian businessman visit-
ing Taiwan who becomes captivated by
a blind girl employed by a bath-house
as a practitioner of Chinese massage.
The girl becomes his mistress and, be-
fore he knows what is happening, their
love has grown true, deep, and bind-
ing. He has to return to Australia and
his wife. Some time later business again
sends him to Formosa, and with dif-
ficulty he traces the girl, Anna, who
by now is the mother of his infant
daughter. Their love becomes even
deeper and truer and he essays a crazy
scheme to bypass the White Australian
laws and smuggle Anna and his baby
into Australia.
Kenneth Greville knows Taiwan, has
studied Chinese history and literature,
handles dialogue (which in this book
is difficult) very well, and describes
Formosan city and rural life splendidly.

tion of restrictive migration laws and of
the objectionable rackets evolved to
evade them is timely and telling.
There remains the first-hand narra-
tor—perhaps the book’s real weak spot.
It is one thing to postulate a sort of
cross between Sir Galahad and Don
Juan, but quite another to add Quixote
to the mixture. There is no logic at
all in this “give-it-a-go” hero: but in
fiction, if not in life, even James Bond
or the Man From O.R.G.Y. demands
the sort of “suspended” logic which
approximates to the suspended dis-
belief of some poetry. I must add that
for my money Anna is very lucky and
I hope her sterling qualities earn her
some modest security in Red China. For
the one thing that clearly emerges is
the sublime selfishness and lack of
foresight of her lover. One shudders
to think of her eventual fate if she had
remained in Sydney where her beloved
brother is now married to an epileptic
blonde waitress who, though fond of
him, finds that studious and pious
youth “a weird sort of a —i” Nice,
blind Anna should be spared not only
the knowledge of this misalliance but
of her lover’s complacent approval of
the arrangement.
Sick Laughter
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Come Back, Dr. Caligari. Donald
Barthelme. Eyre and Spottiswoode.
THE essential elements in the “New
Yorker” writer Donald Bar-
thelme’s style are surprise, the
juxtaposition of disparate facts, a dead-
pan tone, great verbal dexterity, and
name-dropping. It is the old revue trick.
If you want a laugh from your audience
and you cannot think of a good joke
you drop a name. Those of your audi-
ence who know the name will laugh
to show they are in the know. Those
who don’t will laugh to conceal their
ignorance.
Some of Barthelme’s name-juggling
is occasionally very funny, but a lot
of it can only be justified as preten-
tiousness laughing at itself, which is a
bit like the man laughing up his sleeve
at people who laugh up their sleeves.
“The Viennese Opera Ball” has
about as much humor as a curette, but
then I do not suppose it is meani to
be lightly amusing. This is a particularly
vicious story citing lists of high-fashion
models and their wages in between
descriptions of hysterectomies. Many of
the references in the stories would
probably only be picked up by close
observers of the American scene,
t^ie est diese stories Barthelme
presents an absurd and grotesque situa-
on simply and in a masterly tongue-
in-cheek style.
A very funny example is “Hiding
Man,” who is running from religion
and whose intellectual diet consists of
watching films such as “Blood of
Dracula” and “Amazing Colossal Man.”
He derides the mental shallowness of
people who never confront “Screaming
Skull,” “Teenage Werewolf,” and
“Beast With a Thousand Eyes.”
No doubt some people will read
great significance into these stories and
see them as a diagnosis of contem-
porary American spiritual malaise,
However, one sometimes wonders which
is more toxic, the disease or the
diagnosis?

The stones
And their shadows
Are disposed
On raked white sand
That is the sea.
Its formal waves
And their shoaling shadows
Flow silently around
The ordinary rocks that yet
Are far from normal.
They are not stones or rocks,
But clouds or islands,
Mountains in racks of mist,
Shadows of clouds or islands,
Shadows of mountains in racks of mist,
Stepping-stones in light,
Space-stations to the moon of memory,
Cliffs that clarify enclosure,
The private wall I draw at will
Around my presence and its shadows.

“Broaden your knowledge of business in
a systematic, organized way, learn the
problems and viewpoints of all major
departments of business..."
An interview with James M. Jenks, President,
Alexander Hamilton Institute.
famed management consultants—
Booz, Allen & Hamilton—contend
that “The return of rigorous competition
is forcing the improved use of executives.
In many cases the margin of competi-
tive success or failure is locked up in
the quality of management talent.”*
It is in times such as these that
seniority is often thrown out the win-
dow; and that knowledgeable, ambitious
young people are permitted to rise as
fast and as far as their ability enables
them to go. For business has too much
at stake to discriminate on the basis of
age.
The man who can do the job gets
the job . . . whether he’s 28 or 58.
And today—as in critical eras in the
past —top managerial talent is emerging
from big and small organisations
throughout the country. From engineers,
chemists and other technical men. Among
salesmen. Accountants. Lawyers. Market-
ingmen.
Their backgrounds are diverse; but
all of these men share a compelling force
to succeed, and the intelligence to real-
ize that only people with a well-rounded
grasp of business functions can direct the
activities of subordinates.
A fascinating "How To Succeed" Plan
Most people are surprised to learn
that the average age of our subscribers
is closer to 40 than 20.
And we, in turn, are equally surprised
that this mistaken notion has persisted
for so long.
After all, rarely does a man mature
sufficiently until he is in his thirties to
give any serious thought to his future or
to the security of his family.
But the day comes inevitably when he
asks himself: “Where am I going to be
in five or ten years? Will I be able to
put my children through college? Will
my estate support my family for a
reasonable period without the need for
additional funds?”
If he’s fortunate, acts while time is
still on his side, and if the program
he follows is valid, he frequently becomes
successful while he’s still young,
All of this, necessarily, is an over-
simplification of the problem.
For that reason, we have analyzed the
Institute’s approach to executive-training
problems in written form. The program
is outlined fully in a 32-page book titled
“Forging Ahead in Business.”
This little book is not for children
or even the 20-year-old. Rather, it was
designed to show the mature, ambitious
man how to build his career on a solid
foundation —how to cope realistically
with the problems everybody must
meet and solve before he can hope to
aspire to the top managerial level.
A copy is yours for the asking
After having devoted more than fifty
years to helping ambitious men help
themselves, we’re naturally aware of the
reasons why some men reach the heights
at an early age . . . why others don’t
hit their peak until years later . . . and
why some never do make the grade as
major executives.
Surprisingly, native ability and intel-
ligence are not nearly as dominant influ-
ences as as one might expect (the
$15,000-a-year man is not five times as
intelligent as the $3000).
Few men work at more than a frac-
tion of their capacity . . . and most are
willing to settle for mastery of a single
department of business.
Somehow they fail to realize manage-
ment’s need to understand, relate, and
communicate on an overall administrative
level ... to master the basics of market-
ing, accounting, finance and production.
While helping thousands to accom-
plish more in months than they would,
ordinarily, in years, the Institute has
compiled, analyzed and refined authen-
tic case-history material . . . made depth
studies of real and complex business
situations. Thus the training is immedi-
ately applicable to average everyday
business problems.
Many executives have called the
Institute’s descriptive booklet “One of
the most valuable contributions ever
made to business literature.”
It explains the modern method of
attaining success while you’re young-
while you can still enjoy it to the fullest.
Tells you what you must do, what you
must know, to make upwards of $lO,OOO
a year reasonably early in your career.
The program it describes is not meant
for everybody; but if you happen to fit
the pattern of the success-minded man,
it’s entirely possible that yovi, too, will
find that the Institute’s program will
bring you a little closer each day to
your chosen goal.
There’s no charge for “Forging Ahead
in Business” because —depending on the
individual—it can be worth nothing . . .
or a fortune.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Iron Ore Problems
BEFORE the self-congratulations about solving the
Mt. Newman iron ore problem get out of hand, the
sombre point must be made that the victory has been
at considerable cost to Australia.
This is not simply that the two Australian 60 percent
participants in this $240 million-odd project, CSR and
BHP, will have to raise more than $l4O million to finance
the capital costs alone (representing a doubling of the
original Australian commitment) and that much of this
will have to come out of our battered capital market.
The main and most serious implication of the new
Mt. Newman contract to sell Australia’s cheapest iron ore is
that the terms under which the Japanese have agreed to
go along with the changed plans involve selling the ore at
a price that is below the minimum guide-lines laid down by
the Minister for Trade, Mr. McEwen, when he refused
Hamersley’s additional export contract earlier this year.
This “lower-than-guide-lines” price was behind the last-
minute counter-offer of Hamersley and Mt. Goldsworthy to
take over Mt. Newman’s 100-million-ton contract. From
the original $U.5.890 million price for the total contract,
Mt. Newman has trimmed more than SU.S.IB million by
changing specifications; instead of 75 percent well-screened
lump ore and 25 percent fines, they plan to sell 65 percent
lump and 35 percent fines. It is true the prices per unit
have not changed; they remain at 14.6 cents per unit for
lump ore and 12.7 cents for fines (a unit is 1 percent iron
content to the ton). But the changed specifications bring
the average price per ton down from $U.5.8.90 to $U.5.8.72.
It was this change of contract that opened the door for
Hamersley (the CRA-Kaiser consortium) and Goldsworthy
(Consolidated Gold Fields, Utah Construction and Mining,
and Cyprus Mines) to make the late counter-offer, in which
they planned to match Mt. Newman in both price and speci-
fications, no matter what they were.
Goldsworthy meanwhile had offered 3 million tons of fines
over the next six years to the Japanese, first at 17 cents c.i.f.,
then at 16.5 cents; the new Mt. Newman offer is likely to
have cut them out of this market, although they are doing
well in other directions, having pioneered (on October 29)
the first bulk shipment of W.A. iron ore to Europe.
Politically, the latest backing and filling has interesting
overtones. Mt. Newman was constituted with BHP and CSR
having 30 percent equity each, and Amax 40 percent, to
retain Australian control financially and managerially. But
this is being done at the expense of getting the “quarry”
Mr. McEwen has said we do not want; for the ore fines,
instead of being pelletised in Australia, will be treated in.
Japan. The higher proportion of fines will compound this.
These pellets will then compete with the pellets of Hamers-
ley, of Cliffs (who have until November 14 to come up with,
a scheme for continuing their huge Robe River pelletisation
scheme), and, paradoxically, of BHP, whose Why alia pellets
come into production next year.
Another change in the contract has proved embarrassing
for another reason. The contraction of length of delivery
from 20 to 15 years, to increase throughput and make the
deal a better proposition economically, will severely tax
Port Hedland harbor. The contract allows for 3 million
tons to be shipped the first year, 4.5 million the second,
6.5 million the third, and 7.5 million each year thereafter.
This additional load is not appreciated by Mt. Goldsworthy
whose plans may have to be trimmed accordingly.
MEN AND MATTERS
MR. GORDON BARTON’S main
I battle with the Federal Govern-
ment is not over Vietnam,
despite his elegant “Open Letter to the
President of the United States of
America,” which appeared as a full-
page advertisement (costing $1800) in
the “SMH” on the day of Johnson’s
visit to Sydney. y
This former president of the Sydney
Univeristy Liberal Club is battling with
Mr. Holt’s Ministry over its continued
refusal to grant Ipec, Barton’s interstate
transport company, an import licence
for freighter aircraft, even though the
High Court decided last year that he
should be granted an operator’s licence.
Ipec now has a fleet of four old and
patched-up machines flying in the inter-
state airfreight business because the
Civil Aviation Department will not
allow it to import the DC4 Ipec owns,
which is now standing idle in London
(after almost paying for itself in
charter work).
Unless the Government allows Ipec
to import this DC4, it will gradually
have to pull out of airfreight as its
aircraft eventually get too old, so
losing its ability to send packages over-
night from Brisbane to Melbourne and
removing the prospect of doing likewise
between Sydney and Adelaide. Ipec,
now an established aircraft operator,
demanded two
weeks ago that the
Government give it
an imuort licence.
It has not arrived.
Barton, a 37-year-
old Sydney Univer-
sity graduate (8.A.,
LL.B., B.Ec.), who
worked part time
(gardener, store-
man) while an
undergraduate and
managed to com-
bine study for his economics degree
with work toward his law degree,
started Ipec with a partner when he
was 21 (and still studying law),
taking it in turns to drive the one truck
they had. And he hates flying.
WHEN the redoubtable Sir Norman
Robinson, chairman of the
VATC for the past sixteen years,
last week bowed out in favor of Mr.
T. S. Carlyon, he was virtually sealing
his retirement from a distinguished
public life. He gave up the chairman-
ship of John Brown Industries two
years ago and that of Yarra Falls last
November (after a spell of 40 years as
director nine as managing since
the company’s inception). Only one
directorship now remains to him, that
Sir N. Robinson
T. S. Carlyon
Gordon Barton
of the Melbourne board of Norwich
Union Fire Insurance.
The VATC is swapping a textile
man for one whose name is a byword
in Melbourne’s hotel business. At 64,
twelve years younger than Sir Norman,
“Tom” Carlyon, like his brother Nor-
man, has been running hotels in the
City as long as most people can remem-
ber, one in Spencer and the other in
Elizabeth Street. T. S. has been in the
business ever since he left Geelong
Grammar, having served his appren-
ticeship as far afield as Philadelphia
(USA). Later, he was general manager
of Ushers and the Australia in Syd-
ney. When the war claimed him for
the RAAF (Squadron Leader), he was
general manager of Menzies in Mel-
bourne.


An Accountant's Duty
THE Willowbank case, which has ended with the sen-
tencing of Mr. Stanley Korman to six months’ prison
(Mr. Korman is appealing), reaffirms one important
principle in the presentation of company accounts. It is
simply that if any extraneous or special circumstances pertain
to the earning of profits taken into the accounts this must
be stated as an addendum to those accounts. This was not
done in the case of the profits Factors Ltd. showed in its
1957-58 accounts, which went forward without query from
the investigating accountant into the offending prospectus for
a debenture issue made soon after the publication of those
accounts. In fact, the investigating accountant acted on an
instruction to accept the accounts as published and, as Mr.
Peter Murphy in his investigation indicated, this raises the
question whether the Companies Act as it stands is sufi
ficiently specific as to an investigating accountant’s respon-
sibilities.
The burden of proof that the Willowbank profits were of
an exceptional nature fell on the Crown and after a seven-
teen-day hearing the SM, Mr. K. Hudspeth, declared he was
satisfied that they were. He went further. “I am satisfied
on the evidence,” he stated in the judgment, “that the sale
of Willowbank by General Investments and Discounts
to Dominion Pty. Ltd. and the agreement by G.I.D. to lend
Dominion Pty. Ltd. a sum of £500,000 were not separate
transactions, but one transaction.
“The plan was to lift the profits of Automobile Finance
Company of Australia (A.F.C. changed its name to Factors
Ltd. on October 23, 1958), and G.I.D. and ultimately
resulted in the inclusion of a sum of £49,335, the profit
made on the sale of Willowbank, in the figures which were
compiled and presented in the prospectus issued by Factors.”
Bad Old Protection
THE Government’s wholesale adoption of ultra-
protectionist tariff barriers for the thousand-odd items
produced by the chemical industry is a most depressing
new development in the tariff field. In the bad old protec-
tionist tradition, the least efficient and least economic
sections of the industry are grouped together to get the most
protection—4o to 60 percent ad valorem and heaven knows
what effective rates. Items like polyvinylchloride (PVC),
ethylene, and synthetic rubber get 60 percent, roughly double
the previous protection.
The production of a huge range of organic chemicals is
going to be encouraged behind these high barriers, and in
few of them will it be possible to achieve economies of scale
for a long time to come. There is no attempt at specialisa-
tion to be fostered. Economic products, mainly in the
inorganic part of the industry, get litde encouragement,
tariff rates being kept down to a maximum of 25 percent
ad valorem.
Even more ominous than this heavy application of old-style
tariff protection is a new-fangled protective device introduced
for the first time. For 23 items minimum import prices
are being established and a system of sliding duty scales
erected on top of the new conventional tariff structure. This
is not merely to prevent “dumping” but to counter “disrup-
tive low pricing” due to other causes. And the Board men-
tions specifically: technological changes overseas, foreign
governments’ export incentives, and sharp falls in freight
rates. These are such broad factors that it becomes clear
that for the 23 products at least the Board is prepared to
sanction almost complete protection.
Local prices will be defended only to 90 percent of the
difference between them and the “disruptively low” price,
but even so we are getting dangerously close to a floating
tariff which works rigidly as an import ban. Examination
will probably show that this last innovation is contrary to
the provisions of the ,GATT. In any case, further moves in
the direction of a siege economy are not only a blow to
international co-operation but to national development.

asking for $120m., received a total subscription of
sl93m. ... At the same institution Sir Roland Wilson
has retired as Secretary, to be succeeded by the Deputy
Secretary, Sir Richard Randall.
The September quarter’s balance of payments showed
an improvement on the previous (1965) September
figures, a full monetary deficit of s62m. against $110m.;
on current account a sl72m. deficit compared with the
earlier period’s s3l6m. . . . Building approvals for new
houses and flats reached 32,306 in the September
quarter; for the corresponding 1965 quarter they were
30,163.
Additional tariff protection has been given to the
Australian chemical industry; a method of minimum
import prices is to apply to 23 selected items.
September’s savings banks deposits gained s3sm. to
hit $5,391m.; September 1965’s rise was $26.2m.
The Western Australian Government intends to seek
private capital to continue the Ord scheme, following a
further deferment by the Commonwealth.
For the markets: A lack of any vivid interest
characterises most industrial sections in Australian
share markets and embraces the leaders as well. So
three weeks of mild improvement is arrested on rather
moderate turnovers. Some special interest, notably in
Western Mining Corporation, goes to the metals.
Somewhat dismal economic trends keep London
equities very subdued, with blue-chip issues visibly un-
certain; bonds and fixed interests become increasingly
attractive . . . Wall Street has grown a little stronger,
although leaders are subject to a measure of profit-
taking.
For companies: The Mt. Newman iron ore
group, comprising BHP, CSR, and American Metal
Climax, has achieved a re-negotiated contract with the
Japanese steel mills worth sBoom. and covering 100 m.
tons of ore; the project is to be managed by BHP. This
contact negated a strong counter-bid by the Hamersley-
Mt. Goldsworthy groups acting in concert.
Other miners display considerable activity and
promise . . . Broken Hill South reports an “important”
discovery of big phosphate deposits near Cloncurry,
Queensland, but they need two or three more years of
testing and preliminary work; Souths will once more
reduce lead-zinc-silver ore output at Broken Hill, yet
proposes to treat 200,000 tons of residue . . . Mine sur-
plus of North Broken Hill dropped back by $127,000
in the first quarter of 1966-67; directors look forward
to “reasonably satisfactory” trading with lead-zinc
prices around prevailing levels . . . October’s ore pro-
duction at Mount Isa" touched a record daily rate,
although lead and copper output fell . . . Mount Mor-
gan’s reserves are 1,609,000 tons higher at 9,984,000
tons at slightly lower grades . . . Consolidated Rutile
is aiming to produce 30,000 tons of rutile a year ...
A dividend of 24 cents a 50-cent share comes from King
Island Scheelite for the year to October, contrasting
with the previous year’s 5 cents . . . Australian Alu-
minium suffered a $13,589 loss in the first half of 1966.
Airline Qantas saw earnings dip from $4.1 million to
$4 million and paid the Government a $2,655,000 divi-
dend; it predicts a slower rate of traffic growth . . .
Ansett Transport Industries is to raise $5 million ini
debentures, of which $2.5 million is underwritten; the/
company is experiencing better results for both pas-
senger and freight traffic in airline and road divisions.
The receiver of H. G. Palmer has $4 million in hand,
and expects to make a first distribution “soon” . . .
Latec Investments forecasts the finish of its receiver-
ship during the 1967-68 financial year . . . The U.S.

this is the
Australian way of
making steel*
You tear the heart
from a mountain
And you do it with skill and with
care. Before the blasting there’s
test-drilling to be done, and
samples to be taken. Raw
materials mining is a demanding
task, and for the making of
steel in Australia, BHP handles it
all. Below is shown a BHP
quarryman preparing to blast at
Iron Monarch, South Australia,
one of several sources of iron ore
serving all of the Company’s
fully integrated steel plants in
Australia.
You bring to bear 50 years
of steelmaking know-how
Basic oxygen steelmaking,
continuous casting, spectrographic
analysis, vacuum degassing;
these are the techniques
of today’s modern BHP plant.
And another technique is present,
too . . . that of handling the
complex job with the accumulated
experience of 50 years of
steelmaking in Australia. Below:

N.S.W.
And then you check,
and check again
instruments do much of the
watching in a modern BHP
plant, but it also requires skilled
men to watch the watchers.
BHP’s high standards of quality
control are maintained by
qualified technical personnel
constantly watching, adjusting,
and checking, at every stage
of the steelmaking progress.

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Help of
The Helpless
AN old and simple economic propo-
sition not too well understood in
Canberra is that it makes sense to earn
your living as easily as you can by
doing the job you are best suited to as
well as you can. You don’t spread your-
self too much; you specialise and buy
from others what you can’t make or do
efficiently yourself.
On the national level this means that
you should give most encouragement
to industries which have mutual advan-
tages, so that the products of these may
be exported in increasing quantities in
order to finance the purchase of the
things we are least suited to produce.
But the logic of a number of people
in Canberra works in a precisely con-
trary direction. Just take a look at the
latest TarifF Board report on chemicals
and the Government’s statement on
adopting that report.
It drearily retails the disadvantages
under which important sections of the
chemicals industry suffer: the small size
of the domestic market, high costs of
electricity and freight, the large excess
capacity which has to be carried, the
impossibility of exporting profitably,
and so on. All very good reasons, one
would think, according to normal
logic, for looking elsewhere for indus-
tries which should be fostered. But no.
To the inverted protectionist mind, the
more uneconomic an industry and the
more it suffers disadvantages, the more
it is to be helped along.
iQERTAINLY there is a case, as the
minority section of the Tariff Board
suggested in the recent path-breaking
annual report, for giving a good
measure of protection to existing manu-
facturing and farming concerns which
may be uneconomic. The sudden
abandonment of established tariff pro-
tection is out of the question politically:
existing tariffs are almost a contractual
arrangement between Government and
established businesses, and the interests
of employees have to be looked after
by an orderly scheme of redeploying
workers. On economic grounds there
is also a case for maintaining produc-
tion in existing plans which it would
not pay the nation to establish.
But there is no case at all for the
Government’s present policy of purpose-
fully searching out and then encourag-
ing the further development of un-
economic industries. Incredible as it
sounds stated so bluntly, that is exactly
what is being done in the chemicals
tariff, as it was the textiles case last
year. With the sole exceptions of citric
and tartaric acids, hydrogen peroxide,
and pigments and color lakes, the prin-
cW°l applied is that the more the dis-
ability suffered by a product (i.e., the
less economic it is) the more protec-
tion and encouragement it gets.


Wm. HAUGHTON & CO. LIMITED
545 LITTLE COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE
Chairman's Address
to the
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING on 25th OCTOBER, 1966
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Consolidated Net Profit from
trading activities for the year was
$344,094 compared with $32,528 for
the year ended June 30, 1965.
The circumstances of this improved
result are discussed at some length on
pages 4 and 5 of the Directors’ Report.
With the figure of $344,094, which
I have quoted as arising from trading
for the year, there must also be included
the other separate items listed on page
7 of the Profit and Loss Account.
The most important of these items
is the profit on the sale of fixed assets.
This, together with the recoupment of
depreciation on those assets, which
had been charged against previous pro-
fits, contributed a total of $105,150.
After including all these items and
after providing for income tax and
the exclusion of minority interests, the
consolidated accounts of the year ended
30th June, 1966, show a net contribu-
tion of $418,066 to the shareholders of
Wm. Haughton & Co. Limited.
Out of the profit arising from the
trading for the year your Directors have
appropriated $112,000 to cover an
ordinary dividend of 8 percent and
$36,000 to cover the usual preference
dividend.
After payment of the recommended
dividends, and bringing in the credit
balance brought forward from the
previous year, there remains for further
appropriation and carry forward a
sum of $910,838 which compares with
a corresponding figure of $605,204, at
30th June, 1965, after deleting $36,000,
which was reinstated from General
Reserve in that year.
We have decided that this is an
opportune stage to make some desirable
appropriations from this balance, as
have been described in the Directors’
report, and at the same time we have
made the re-arrangements to our
Reserves which are also mentioned in
that report.
You will note that the Group over-
draft shows an increase of $852,000 for
the year. However, of this figure, a total
of $778,000 directly reflects reductions
in Creditors, Term Liabilities, and
Provisions. Group stocks have increased
by $530,000, but Debtors have been
reduced by $237,000.
In a very fluid export business like
ours the Bank overdraft position on any
day reflects the combination of the
items, Stock and Debtors less Creditors
and is principally affected by export
stocks awaiting shipment and clearance
of proceeds. The total amount thus in-
volved can be very large, and can
vary markedly from day to day.
It will be seen that the expenditure
(net after sales) on Fixed Assets for
the year, at $159,000, is less than the
depreciation of $176,000 provided in
the accounts for the year.
In general, your Directors are pleased
with the year’s operations, especially
after taking into consideration the con-
tinued competitiveness and over-fine
margins of the wool trade, and the
adverse effects of the drought, especially
in New South Wales. It remains to be
fully tested how effective will be our
improved and more sensitive methods
of profit control in coping with the
Company’s historic problem of how
to maintain revenue on a falling market.
Reorganisation of the Group’s activi-
ties to meet changing circumstances has
continued, and as part of that pro-
gramme, our modern sheepskin grad-
ing and packing store near Brisbane
has commenced operations. Improved
techniques of management accounting
are now in operation throughout the
Group. This strengthens the defence
against rising costs, though these remain,
as in other businesses, a serious prob-
lem.
Perhaps I may now offer a few com-
ments in a wider context.
The international trademark for pure
new wool introduced by the Interna-
tional Wool Secretariat in overseas
countries in 1964, was launched into
the Australian market by the Australian
Wool Board in 1966. The Wool Symbol
has important objectives. It aims at
giving pure new wool a clear identity
at the point of sale of the finished
product amongst the vast array of
natural and artificial fibres and fabrics
marketed. In addition, by setting strict
standards of manufacture for articles
which carry the trademark, it “under-
writes” the quality of the articles and
protects the consumer.
If these objectives are attained, they
will establish wool more firmly at the
quality end of the market, and take it
out of direct confrontation with syn-
thetic fibres, whose price in the past
has had a depressive effect on that of
wool.
At the meeting of the International
Wool Textile Organisation held in
Lisbon earlier this year, the greatest
emphasis was placed upon the import-
ance of wool as a textile fibre. This was
a decision taken by the world wool
textile industry, who use not only wool,
but all manner of man-made fibres.
They affirmed many times during the
Conference their confidence in wool as
a fibre, and stressed the need to secure
increased production of wool.
To achieve this end, the Conference
urged the cessation of artificial bar-
riers to free trade in raw wool. They
urged the necessity of encouraging
growers to increase production, and to
this end, that the fruits of research
into production should be disseminated
amongst growers as widely as possible.
In my report one year ago, I referred
to the problem of international liquidity,
or the restrictive effect on international
trade of a chronic shortage of pounds,
dollars, and gold. I then warned that
unless this problem could be solved
soon, companies and countries like
our own would be likely to suffer. It
is a cause for concern that, in the
year which has elapsed, so little pro-
gress has been made towards a solution,
though the Federal Treasurer has ably
represented Australia’s views at a
recent international conference. The
position has, indeed, deteriorated,
largely as a result of the balance of
payments problems of both Britain and
the United States. I can only repeat,
with great earnestness, that the problem
is a grave one and, unless cured, in-
volves a risk of return to something like
the international financial restrictions of
the 1920 s and 19305.
Another cause for concern is seen
in the high level of interest rates
throughout the world. This also is not
unconnected with the balance of pay-
ments problems of London and Wash-
ington. Being like all large export
businesses, both traditionally and nec-
essarily dependent on overdraft financ-
ing, your company finds high interest
rates a heavy burden.
We deeply regret to report the death
in April of Mr. D. H. Hanson, an
Associate Director, who was in charge
of the Company’s sheepskins operations
and had arranged to retire on 30th
June. Mr. Hanson was known and re-
spected internationally in the sheep-
skin trade and had served the company
for almost fifty years.
He was succeeded by his deputy, Mr.
R. C. Mitchell, who was appointed an
Associate Director.
The Company’s staff have been un-
remitting in their efforts, both in
Australia and overseas. On your behalf
I thank them warmly for their loyal
and energetic services.

Talking Their Own Books
PEOPLE in Melbourne talk their
own books harder than usual in
the first week in November. Oil
magnates are no exception. But, like
punters, for all their big words, none
can be confident of affecting the posi-
tion at Flemington or elsewhere.
If the chorus of complaint from dis-
affected oil interests has reached a-
crescendo in ihe last week or so, we
have also been witnessing another chap-
ter in the serialised squabble between
the States and the Commonwealth
Governments for the carve-up of oil
royalties from the as yet undeveloped
oil and gas deposits .discovered off the
Victorian coast. The latter serial has
been in progress for more than a year
now and after their meeting here last
week the various Ministers called it a
day until near Christmas.
While the authorities are not letting
any cats out of the royalties bag, oil
company chairmen have been suffering
from no inhibitions at all in airing their
grievances.
First we had Mr. J. G. Donaldson,
chairman of Woodside, laying it on
thick in the annual report by saying
“It looks almost as if the Common-
wealth and State Governments are bent
on running the Australian exploration
companies into the ground by making
it financially impossible for them to
share in the full rewards of their dis-
coveries.” He was referring, of course,
to the proposed Federal legislation
which provides that 4-9ths of a produc-
ing area be forfeited to the State in
which the discovery is made -and the
State shall then auction the area.
'J'HEN it was Mr. Hamilton Sleigh’s
turn. In the H. C. Sleigh report he
seemed anxious to sustain the head of
steam pressing the Government to drop
its policy of not paying subsidies jail
wells drilled within a radius of between
20 to 30 miles of a discovery well. Next
he joined hands with a lot of others
in their hate against the high level of
protection for indigenous crude, saying
it would be far preferable to increase
the direct subsidies to oil search com-
panies as a means of encouragement
to exploration.
Next it was BP. It’s a pity the
clamor for President Johnson drowned
the rumbustious thought of its chair-
man, Sir Maurice Bridgeman, at the
opening of the Westernport refinery.
But if this big BP occasion went almost
unnoticed by the Melbourne Press,
Bridgeman has since found other com-
munications avenues for an old-style
lion’s roar. While this was refreshing,
with so much trumpeting of America’s
interest in us, coming from an inter-
national oil company enjoying a large
share of the Australian petroleum pro-
ducts market and lately financing its
expansion here mostly on local capital,
it will seem to most Australians that
Bridgeman put his complaints rather
audaciously. ,
The biggest of BP s beefs (shared
by Hamilton Sleigh) would seem to be
the high price of Moonie oil, which it
is at present using at the rate of about
700,000 barrels a year, or roughly 20
percent of the total Moonie output.
Bridgeman said BP was being forced to
pay more for Moonie oil than it could
sell it for. He didn’t quarrel with the
need to assure a guaranteed outlet for
Moonie oil, but only with the exorbi-
tant price the Tariff Board and the
Federal Government had cooked up.
When Sir Maurice says BP is losing
$1 a barrel on all the Moonie oil it
is obliged to refine, the figure is struck
in relation to the profit it earns on
refining crude imported from its own
sources in Kuwait, the cheapest in the
world. Naturally he is jaundiced at
the thought that, at the fixed price
elected by the Government to be paid
for Moonie oil, the latter’s proprietors
earn three times as much per barrel
as his company does in Kuwait. This has
nothing to do with it. Perhaps the
price BP is having to pay for Moonie
oil is higher than it need be, but
national fuel policy cannot be dictated
by BP’s or any other international oil
company’s profit and loss account. BP,
like all other refining companies here,
are going to have increasing quantities
of local crude to refine in the future
and the best way for them to soften
the blow would be to try harder to dis-
cover their own sources of it.

You don’t measure a grinding wheel merely by its physical dimensions.
There’s a lot more to it than that. Knowledge, technical experience,
service ... priceless ingredients which only Australian Abrasives can
provide . . . are equally essential considerations in the measurement
of a grinding wheel. A.A. Sales Engineers and their Distributors are
anxious to prove this to you. If you have a grinding or abrasive mach-
ining problem in your plant, send this advertisement to us on your

MICHAEL BAUME'S SYDNEY
The Money
For Iron Ore
HERE’S hoping that CSR and
BHP will have less difficulty
encouraging Australian financial
institutions (particularly the life
offices) to contribute to their $240
million capital commitment in iron ore
at Mt. Newman than U.S. iron ore
giant Pickands Mather appears to have
had in raising only about $3 million
from them for its Tasmanian iron ore
project.
Pickands Mather, which has negoti-
ated contracts to export 45 million
tons of pellets from Savage River,
worth more than $4OO million in ex-
port income, has, with its associates,
raised $72 million of the $75 million
being put up. But for sensible reasons
it limited the amount of equity being
sold in the U.S. and offered $3 mil-
lion or so to local institutions to allow
for Australian participation. After
several months’ hard selling, it now
appears these arrangements are almost
completed and will probably be
announced soon.
The chairman of Pickands Mather,
Mr. John Sherwin, told me last week,
as he passed through Sydney on a two-
week Australian visit, that the pro-
position put to the locals was a mixture
of 5 to 6 percent redeemable prefer-
ence shares and ordinary equity in
which the expected return is between
15 and 20 percent over the 20 years
of the existing contract. There is a
chance that this return could increase
after eight years when the price of 18£
cents per unit f.o.b. changes to whatever
is the ruling three-year average price
in Japan and Pickands Mather
think it could not be much lower than
the present price, and will very likely
be higher.
ON the face of it, there were some
sound reasons for institutional
caution; both CRA and BHP had
looked at and rejected Mr. Roy Hud-
son’s Savage River ore, largely because
of its high titanium content. But Pick-
ands Mather have found out how to
separate the bulk of the titanium in
the crushing and pelletising process.
The project is owned 50 percent by
the Japanese (Mitsubishi and Sumi-
tomo, involving five steel mills) and
50 percent by the U.S.-Australian
group which Pickands Mather organ-
ised as managing agents, which in-
cludes the Rockfeller brother’s Pocan-
tico Corporation and Cerro Corpora-
tion, and in which Australian interests
(including Mr. Roy Hudson’s Kath-
leen Investments Ltd.) will be taking
up a 10 percent stake in the venture.
The current project would have
capacity for exporting a further 15
million tons of pellets before begin-
ning to develop the major part of the
orebody, most of which is still in Mr.
Hudson’s hands.

After the President - What?
By CROESUS
JOINING in the tumultuous recep-
tion to President Johnson in the
Swanston Street crowds I got to
wondering whether all that many Aus-
tralians were aware of the economic
implications of “going all the way”
or even cared about them. j
My thoughts went back to the Sal-
erno landing in 1943, when the 10th
British Corps was fighting alongside the
American 6th, as equals I’d imagined,
against a common foe. My job was
intelligence and I’d recruited a lot of
agents to help in the hunt for German
spies and disaffected Italians. As the
battle proceeded, some of these agents
necessarily had to move back and forth
between our area and the American.
To avoid being arrested they carried an
official security pass signed by myself
and stamped by the- War Office. One
of these chaps didn’t return from a
mission and I got worried. Eventually
I called at American HQ and dis-
covered that the U.S. Counter Intelli-
gence Corps had arrested him and
thrown him into the civilian jail at
Santa Maria Capua Vetera. I was in-
censed and promptly proceeded to the
.jail (which was in their territory) and,
despite strong protests by the U.S.
janitor, released him.
My point is that it’s very nice to
fight alongside the Americans, but you
don’t want to let them take you over.
I hope that Mr. Holt, an old school
contemporary of mine, is aware of
what exactly he is letting Australia in
for, because, as I and a lot of other
serious-minded people see it, he has
gone in boots and all with the Ameri-
cans. I am not speaking of the military
dangers here, only the economic.
F in the enthusiasm of the moment,
Mr. Holt is not aware of the impli-
cations or has forgotten them, he
should read the final chapters of Pro-
fessor Walter Krause’s “International
Economics.” There they are put on the
line by the professor from the State
University of lowa in terms quite dif-
ferent to those we heard from the gen-
erous, warm-hearted President from
Texas, whose personal attitudes as ex-
pressed in Australia would in them-
selves seem unimpeachable. Let me
quote a few passages from Krause.
Under a subhead “Prevailing Policy”
Krause writes: “The broad objective of
American foreign economic policy is
identical with that of the country’s
overall foreign policy: to protect and
advance the national (U.S.) interest.
This identity of objective a basically
self-interest objective should come
as no surprise, for foreign economic
policy is but one facet of foreign
policy. Indeed, foreign policy should
prove compatible with domestic policy
as well, the two together comprising
the official policy of the country.”
So far so good. Then he says this:
“In the case of the United States, the
basic interpretation of some years’
standing ascribes three main components
to foreign economic policy. First, the
country desires to promote its own
economic strength. To this end there
is an interest in large and growing
markets abroad capable of absorbing
a substantial volume of goods from this
country; in an assured supply of needed
raw-material imports; in more interna-
tional trade generally, likely to assure
this country of more of the potential
benefits of specialisation; and in a
healthy investment situation abroad
able to provide the capital of this
country, especially of private capital,
with attractive outlets.”
WE can pause here and reflect that
American foreign economic policy
has been succeeding very well in all
these objectives in recent years. In par-
ticular, its broad waves have been
washing on our shores with increasing
force in the exact terms of Krause’s ex-
position thus far. We didn’t hear a word
about this first objective of American
foreign economic policy from President
Johnson, and it is. only when Krause
goes on to express the second and third
of the objectives that we link with the
President. That is, the second is “the
country desires to promote the economic
strength of other countries to this
end the hope is for prosperity (with
peace) within the free world generally,
including an accelerated rate of de-
velopment in the underdeveloped
countries” and third, “the country de-
sires to promote unity within the free
world. To this end, the hope is to
eliminate disputes among the free world
countries and to lessen tensions
generally, so as to prevent any weaken-
ing of the free world on that account.”
Thus, says Krause, “The components
of American foreign policy reflect a
mixture of economic and politico-
military considerations. This country
wants prosperity and growing economic
well-being for itself and sees its foreign
economic policy as a contributing
factor. The country also wants politi-
cal-military security for itself and,
again, sees its foreign economic policy
as a contributing factor. And humani-
tarianism is involved, too. This country,
known for its generosity, is not im-
pervious to the sometimes dire needs of
others, particularly of the undeveloped
countries.”
It is a cruel dilemma for us because
we have to face the fact that we might
not be able to have the security and
humanitarian implications of American
foreign economic policy without the
hard commercial ones. This is what
worries me and I dare say it disturbs
the President also. As I have stated
here before, we want America to be in-
terested in us, to help develop the
economy. But we don’t want to be
swamped by America or its business-
men. We don’t want to be left alone,
either. Let us hope we can reach a
sensible compromise before it is too
late and we lose our national identity.
At the moment, I fear, though, that
taking their cue from the popularity of
the President on his recent visit here,
we could be in for a deluge of Ameri-
can business interests coming here for
their chop^-


"Disasters prompted by fraud and dishonest dealings" by-
THE LAND BOOMERS
Company crashes and sending
businessmen to jail are nothing
new in Victoria. It all happened
eighty years ago in the great land
boom. This is the first of three
instalments from Michael Cannon's
book "The Land Boomers" (Mel-
bourne University Press, $7.50) to
be printed in The Bulletin.
VISITORS to the colony of Victoria
in the 1880 s were awed and dazzled
by the astonishing progress of its
capital city. They began to call it “Mar-
vellous Melbourne.” Everywhere they
looked the humble buildings of the early
colonists were being pulled down, and
in their place were rising the great gran-
ite piles of a myriad financial institu-
tions. In the suburbs, on the rolling
hills of Camberwell or the level pad-
docks of Brighton, luxurious mansions
were built by the score for the newly
rich. In the nearer industrial suburbs,
rows of terrace houses and cottages went
up by the thousand for a suddenly pros-
perous and fast-breeding artisan 'class.
Business boomed. Banking boomed.
Money poured in from overseas. The
frenzy grew and fed upon itself. Thous-
ands of acres of suburban land were
subdivided and resold many times, each
time at a higher price. Millions of shares
changed hands in a stock-exchange
saturnalia. Anyone, it seemed, could
make a fortune in this incredible
colony.
his own amusement, a visitor
might hail a horse cab and drive in
leisurely fashion along the “Golden
Street,” Collins Street, a street of
dreams and bubble companies. On his
left, before he crossed Swanston Street,
he could admire Queen’s Walk, with its
wonderful lead-light cupolas sheltering
a shopping arcade. Italianate office
buildings rose magnificently on either
side and a gilt statue of Britannia
reigned on the lofty cornice. This edifice
was built by Sir Matthew Davies out
of the lavish funds of the Freehold
Investment Co. Ltd. Davies put his
elder brother in charge of it. Who
would dare dream that very shortly
Sir Matthew Davies, leading financier
and the Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly, would be arrested on criminal
charges? Or that his brother would go
bankrupt for more than half a million
pounds?
Just over Swanston Street was the
elaborate five-storey Premier Building,
designed in French Renaissance style.
This was the home of the Premier Per-
manent Building Association and its
guiding genius, James Mirams. A
wonderful man* “Jimmy” Mirams; a
strict teetotaller (like most of his fellow
company promoters of the day); a great
provider of houses for the people;
altogether a man to be trusted. Invest-
ors thought so, and gave millions into
his keeping before his arrest and im-
prisonment.
Next door to the Premier Building,
sandwiched between that and the “Age”
office, rose a noble institution known
as the Real Estate Bank. This was
started by another teetotaller, James
Munro, who rose to be Premier of
Victoria. He also founded the Federal
Bank farther down on the corner of
Collins and Elizabeth Streets. Abso-
lutely trustworthy! Depositors agreed
and their faith cost them two million
pounds sterling. When the bubble was
about to burst, Munro hastily had him-
self appointed Agent-General in London
and fled the colony. He returned later
to face his creditors and the Insolvency
Court. There was no provision in the
flimsy Companies Act of the day by
which he could be charged with fraud
and he escaped without penalty.
Just on the other side of the “Age”
office, at 243 Collins Street, there
traded the famous partnership of
Messrs. Munro & Baillieu, then the
city’s most successful auctioneers and
estate agents. Donald Munro was the
son of James Munro, whose history we
have just briefly scanned. W. L. Baillieu
was a large, bustling young man who
had pulled himself up by his own boot-
straps from poverty to sudden wealth.
James Munro backed the two young
fellows. He arranged for his banks to
lend them £lBO,OOO to play the land
market. They lost it all and the de-
positors never saw the money again.
A little farther down Collins Street,
where Centreway Buildings now stand,
were the Metropolitan Bank and the
Metropolitan Permanent Building
Society. These two institutions were
also highly successful in disposing of
their depositors’ cash. One of the direc-
tors was Henry Hayter, the widely re-
spected Government Statist of the day.
Hayter was so good at figures that he
went bankrupt for £36,000 and paid his
creditors 3d. in the £l.
On the other side of Collins Street
was the superb new shopping arcade
known simply as “The Block.” This
was the inspired creation of Benjamin
Fink, another financial genius who rose
from poverty to the control of mil-
lions. Shoppers who thronged “The
Block” often saw his short, portly figure
bustling from one splendid enterprise to
another to his building called Roths-
child Chambers (now Collins House J,
or to the office block in Flinders Street
called Fink’s Buildings. Soon, soon, the
prosperous shoppers and Fink himself
were to disappear from the Melbourne
scene; Fink to go bankrupt, owing
£1,500,000, and to flee abroad with
his family.
Hundreds of other companies,
usually short-lived, crowded the city
during the hectic years of the boom.
Some built whole new suburbs;
pioneered telephone, electricity, gas,
and tram services. Others had nothing,
built nothing, and lived on borrowed
time. Interspersed between these vaga-
bond companies were the responsible
banks, who usually refused to lend
too high a proportion of their funds on
speculative ventures. Most of these
established banks weathered the hard
times by one means or another but
they got such a scare that Australian
banking became an extremely cautious
business for many years thereafter.
In 1886 it appeared to some of the
associated banks that the land boom
had reached its zenith and would now
plunge downwards. They became
alarmed at the large withdrawals being
A New Verb to “Fink” it.
SMITH: “Hello, Brown! I saw that
you were to have a meeting of your
creditors the other day. You didn’t funk
it?”
BROWN: “No; I fink’d it. A half-
penny in the pound.”

and paid ½d. in the pound.)
made to meet land payments, and in-
creased the interest rate on deposits
and overdrafts by one percent.
The land promoters began looking
elsewhere for easy finance. Thus the
years 1888, 1889, and even 1890, saw
the formation of most of the disastrous
land and finance companies, and so-
called “land banks.” Under the loose
banking and company laws of the
time, they were able to take saving
deposits, issue shares, float loans, dis-
count promissory notes and other com-
mercial paper, and, in general, per-
form all the functions of an established
bank.
At the end of 1888, there began a
series of calamitous industrial conflicts
between employers and the developing
unions, mainly in the maritime and
pastoral industries. For a few months,
many investors still appeared to be

hypnotised by the boom. By the time
they realised that the crash was indeed
final, practically every land company
was in liquidation and calls on their
shares had gone forth.
The same pressure was felt by the
land banks, many of which owned
shares in associated speculative com-
panies. Some were able to use the pub-
lic’s cash deposits to stay open a little
longer. But one after the other they
toppled, the pressure multiplying each
day as their depositors took fright and
withdrew their cash. From July, 1891,
when the Imperial Bank suspended pay-
ment, to March, 1892, when the Aus-
tralian Deposit and Mortgage Bank
suspended, no fewer than 20 major
financial institutions, with liabilities of
nearly £2O million, closed down. In
all, more than 130 public companies
wound up their affairs in those eight
desperate months.
By the end of 1891 the bottom had
completely dropped out of the land
market. Superb allotments could be
picked up in almost any suburb for
£lO to £lOO.
'J'HE falsifying of balance sheets, the
payment of dividends from non-
existent profits, and the publication of
misleading optimistic forecast were
among the shocking features of the
crash. Men who were widely known
and trusted, who had been knighted by
the Queen, who occupied the highest
political and business positions took
leading parts in the manipulations.
Once-prosperous merchants were
forced into liquidation. The George
brothers, who ran George and George,
drapers, in Collins Street, both made
private compositions with their credi-
tors. W. K. Thomson, who owned a
half-share in McEwan’s hardware store,
went bankrupt. Finney, Isles & Co.,
famous Brisbane store founded in the
1860 s, went into liquidation with lia-
bilities of £115,000.
The year 1892 may have been
sombre, but the disasters to come in
1893 were quite unprecedented. Enough
misuse of financial power had been
revealed to make every man suspicious
of the soundest institutions, and to be
fearful about the safety of his own
bank deposits. Quietly, then more
quickly, a general run on the established
banks began.
On the weekend of April 29-30 the
great and powerful National Bank
privately advised the Premier that be-
cause of the continuous run on deposits
it intended to suspend business on the
Monday. On Sunday, April 30, Cabi-
net met secretly and decided to declare
the whole week a “banking holiday.”
On Monday, May 1, 1893, men
picked up their morning papers to
read the incredible news that the
colony’s entire banking system had
apparently broken down. However, two
banks, the Union Bank and the Bank
of Australasia, remained open. The task
of reconstructing the banking system
occupied several months while trade
languished and men starved.

ICIANZ's Chemical Reaction
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
THE market does not believe it, but
things are looking up for
ICIANZ. Last week the shares
slipped down to within 7 cents of their
lowest point for the year of $3.40 to
provide almost the cheapest entry into
this company for more than a decade.
ICIANZ has so many irons in the
fire that investors apparently do not
consider last week’s tariff changes by
the Government to merit upgrading the
shares.
But in view of its big stake in inor-
ganic chemicals, which get the biggest
tariff protection, the chemical industry’s
complaint that the new tariff protection
was unsatisfactory and was not enough
to restore profitability may not bear too
much relevance to ICl’s case. In addi-
tion it will benefit from the Govern-
ment’s new $l6-a-ton urea bounty.
Next month’s result from ICIANZ
will probably be of higher profits but
lower earning rates, judging by the
marginal profit rise in the first half
(despite an 18 percent lift in sales) and
the forecast of higher second-half
profits given in the recent debenture
prospectus.
Unimpressive as a likely earning rate
below 10 percent for 1965-66 may look
for this group, investors with an eye
to the future could consider the prob-
able impact on its profits of the end
of the drought (which severely limited
the company’s substantial fertiliser sales
In a period of rapid expansion of
capacity and also of rural chemicals).
And it is significant that in last year’s
report the company complained of the
effect on its profits of cut-price imports
of many chemicals, so the new tariff
situation should help this considerably.
Another company that should benefit
is CSR, whose chemical activities are
heavily -in the inorganic sector. And
Moulded Products and Overseas Cor-
poration have PVC interests that will
come behind a 60 percent tariff wall.
PLUGGING Western Australian
stocks was all the rage two or
three years ago, and, while the
fashion has receded slightly, the West
is still turning in good figures. This
has been pointed out by a Perth broker
who has kept tabs on 30 major com-
panies operating in his State. The sur-
vey covers the past five years. He re-
calls that five years ago the Sydney
Stock Exchange all ordinaries index
was about the same level as it is today;
so changes have been made against a
flat across-the-board backdrop.
In this time the average market gain
of the 30 stocks has been 32 percent, a
rate of 6.4 percent annually. For the
best nine companies, the gain was 115
percent; for the worst nine performers
—and these include the national oil
companies Ampol Petroleum and H. C.
Sleigh—the average loss was 26 percent,
or 5.2 percent annually.
Passiona Bottling Co. has shown the
most spectacular rise with an average
capital appreciation of 33 percent,
mainly through last year’s three-for-five
par issue. Share price of the monopoly
Swan Brewery has improved more
steadily than any other stock at an
average of 32 percent a year; Bunning
Timber’s figure is 27 percent; machin-
ery distributors Wigmores, helped by
the primary sector’s growth, 24 per-
cent; Caterpillar distributors ISAS 15
percent; and West Australian News-
papers 14 percent.
Two others out of the prestige range
went particularly well: Vox -Adeon
Howard, a strong and growing group in
electrical retailing, averaged an 18 per-
cent annual capital appreciation; and
the reorganised hardware wholesaler
McLean Bros, and Rigg has recovered
from a bad run to score 11 percent.
Ripples from the inflow of northern
development capital have helped the
West, which has had a record wheat
harvest at a time other States were
hit by the drought. And the outlook
continues to be favorable, with another
record crop expected. This alone should
help tractor company Chamberlain,
quite apart from the likely benefits
from the Government’s removal of a
limit on profits under the Tractor
Bounty Act.
Apart from some slightly' soft spots
in retail sales and motor vehicles,
economic pointers particularly in
building and construction —are very
favorable indeed. The recent State
Budget, which has had initial defla-
tionary effects by taking money out of
private sector, should, in the medium
term, turn inflationary. This, in turn,
should enhance equity investments.
THE CHARTIST’S recommenda-
tion of Mary Kathleen Uranium
shares on the opposite page fol-
lows suggestions made here many
months ago that the next boom would
be in uranium. But since MKU is un-
likely to start production again until
the 19705, the more interesting way to
share in this prospect seems to be
through its 35 percent owner, Kathleen
Investments, which has many other
money-earning interests as well as two
major underground uranium leases that
make it potentially Australia’s biggest
uranium miner.
Last year’s 10 percent profit went
nowhere near covering its 25 percent
dividend, most of which was paid out
of tax-free uranium profits earned be-
fore Mary Kathleen closed down in
1963. But this year Kathleen Invest-
ment’s $llO,OOO losses on W.A. ilmen-
ite will be turned into sizable profits,
its $230,000 earnings from rutile (it
owns half of Rutile and Zircon Mines
at Newcastle with Peko-Wallsend) will
also rise, and its Pilbara Tin operations,
which last year earned $llO,OOO, will
help to kick its profits along while
waiting for uranium.
And on top of all that, the com-
pany stands to earn between 15 and 20
percent (as a minimum) on its ex-
pected investment in the Savage River
iron ore project by 1968-69, the first
full year of shipments.
SINCE Hunter Douglas shares were'
recommended by our Security
Analyst on September 24 their
price has fallen by about 10 cents,
giving a short-term victory to the
Chartist, who was quite unimpressed
by their technical market position. To
so,me extent this fall may have been
due to last week’s balance sheet, which
showed that the 10 percent profit rise
of the preliminary profit statement was
cut in half when adjustments for capi-
tal losses and tax overprovisions for
the previous year were made. In addi-
tion, the accounts showed a one-third
increase in creditors and debtors des-
pite the fact that turnover remained
steady; revealed a steady depreciation
provision despite a 25 percent addition
to plant and equipment, and an unex-
plained provision of $72,000 being
made before profit.
But things are probably not as they
look; the moves in debtors and credi-
tors are understood to be due simply
to changed seasonal conditions at
balance date, which gave the company
better sales in the past two months
than in the previous year, and not to
any serious change in financial policy;
the profit is very conservatively stated,
with tax at the rate of 46 percent to
pre-tax profit (a rise from the 41
percent of the previous year). This is
well over the “standard” rate of 42-|-

percent, despite the $40,000 or so
available in tax allowances on new
plant—and the company deducts its
long-service leave provision before
striking profit.
The company’s diversification into
other products than Venetian blinds
(which still make up much of its
business), such as coated metals and
building materials like house siding,
should give it greater safety from any
possible fashion swings against Vene-
tians.
And there is plenty of plant capacity
to be taken up should consumer spend-
ing come alive again in co,ming
months; when (and if) that happens,
this stock could be quite interesting.
SINCE Shelleys, British Tobacco’s
Sydney soft-drink subsidiary,
started spending a lot of money
trying to break into the Schweppes-
dominated mixer market (presumably
to counter Schweppes’ move earlier this
year into Shelleys-dominated big-bottle
family-style soft drinks), the price of
Schweppes shares has fallen eight cents.
But probably the main reason for
Schweppes’ market slip was the chair-
man’s forecast last week that world
economic conditions and the drought
“could” have a steadying influence on
Schweppes’ expansion rate for the next
year or so.
Following the August $750,000 new
share issue, last year’s capital expendi-
ture on plant and equipment of
$385,687 (mainly on a Melbourne can-
ning line) seems certain to be exceeded
by this year’s installation of a larger
canning line in Sydney and the re-
location of the existing Sydney line
in Perth (largely for exports). By June
30 the company already had capital
spending commitments of $253,456.
However, this year could see some slow-
ing down in the rate of purchase of
bottles, as the move into 260 z. ones
brought a $-| million increase in the
book value of containers.
Last week’s annual report confirmed
suggestions that the British parent com-
pany had raised the $508,500 needed
to take up its 67.7 percent share of
the recent new issue by the Australian
company by calling up a short-term
loan to the local Schweppes (shown in
the accounts as totalling $558,741). It
was repaid by a long-term bank loan.
Schweppes stands to benefit con-
siderably from the British parent’s
transfer of some of its South-East Asian
areas to the Australian company (for
an undisclosed, but apparently modest,
consideration). Apart from the tax
benefits that export promotion will
bring, increased profits are expected to
follow the further development of these
areas by the Australian company;
development that may have been limi-
ted by the U.K.’s capital export controls
had they remained in the parent com-
pany’s hands.
With big moves from Shelleys and
Coca-Cola, things are hotting up (in-
cluding the weather) in the soft-drink
war, but Schweppes still looks the best
of them all.
The Chartist says:
MARY KATHLEEN URANIUM is a stock in a very promising technical
situation. The long-term downtrend which followed the top formation
of 1959/60 was broken late in 1965 and the steep rise over recent months
has already taken prices to a high point of $3.45 for the year. An uptrend has
now been established at a rate of approximately 100 percent appreciation per
annum and the base consolidation suggests that prices could eventually rise to
about $4.50 where strong resistance would be encountered from the previous top
formation. At this point the situation would call for reassessment as even higher
targets would be a distinct possibility for this stock. Last sale price on 27/10/66
$3.20.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
The quiet markets and wavering tin prices didn’t do much
for two days’ dealings in the much bruited Cleveland Tin
float: the 50 cent shares, paid to 10 cents, hit 49 cents at first
and closed at 45; the theoretical value in September had indi-
cated about 60 cents. Western Mining, however, drew fairly
vigorous attention (especially in Melbourne), gaining 60 cents
to reach $6.70. New tariff provisions could not help ICIANZ,
which shed 5 cents to $3.49.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Boral's Slide at Its End?
HAS Boral past the worst? In the
past three years, the price of
Boral’s 50 cent shares has been
cut in half to sl.7s—and last month
they fell to a seven-year low of $1.59
before bouncing back a bit.
And all with good reason. For during
this period of rapid expansion and
big deals, everything has gone up
except profits and dividends; the
1965-66 profit was 30 percent below
that of 1963-64; earning rate has fallen
from 36.6 percent on capital to 22.2
percent (giving very little cover to
the 20 percent dividend); and earnings
on total funds employed in the business
have slumped from 7.1 percent to only
4.2 percent.
However, there are signs that the
downhill slide may be near, or even
at, its end. There are still a lot of
problems to be faced in the Boral
camp, but there are also what manag-
ing director Elton Griffin describes as
“encouraging developments” that
should improve the 1966-67 results.
Losses on the Queensland beef roads
(which, together with Hebburn coal
losses, cost the company sfm. in 1965-
66) are now finalised, and the Gas
Supply Co. and Petrochemical Hold-
ings look set for more profitable times.
Rationalisation of Victorian quarrying
should boost profits even in 1966-67,
and the Isomax cracker should do like-
wise in 1967-68.
Boral’s ssm. Isomax Hydro Cracker,
now being installed, will be on stream
by April, 1967, and will require 16
percent less crude to produce the same
volume of finished products. Production
of high-value specialty oils not made
here yet will also be possible. But
Boral will get some benefits even before
the cracker comes in; investment allow-
ance on it could reduce Boral’s tax
liability by slm. in 1966-67.
fpAX savings are a big factor in Boral’s
liquidity; it expects a cash flow over
the next three years from these and
from depreciation of about $17.5 mil-
lion, on top of retained profits, so there
are no forced sales of its investments
likely. It has plenty of ready cash now.
Of the sBm. raised in the January,
1966, debenture issue, s6m. went into
the Isomax cracker and s2m. was desig-
nated for the joint fertiliser project
with ICIANZ and Mitsui, which fell
through, leaving Boral with surplus
funds. These, together with bills of
exchange and full use of the large over-
draft accommodation (already used to
$3.5m. at balance date), will finance the
current purchase of Melbourne’s Bay-
view Quarries Ltd.
The offer for Bayview is $12.2m. cash
for its assets of slom. (and net assets
of $5.6m.) and will give Boral 65-70
percent of Victorian stone production,
some 37 percent of concrete and 80
percent of the hotmix business. The big
problem in buying such a large propor-
tion of an industry is that it can provide
an ideal situation for rivals to eat away
at the dominant one’s share.
Nevertheless, transport . costs of
Albion-Reid and Bayview, currently
about ssm. a year, can be reduced sub-
stantially by supplying customers from
the nearest point of production; produc-
tion of the 12 operating quarries can
also be rationalised to substantially in-
crease the profitability of Victorian
operations.
As Boral sees it, it is paying sl2m.
for Bayview, whose net equity is $5.6m.
The balance of $6.4m. can be said to
be for goodwill and stone reserves of
101.5 m. tons (doubling stone reserves
of the group), which works out at less
than 7c a ton, compared with $2.50 a
ton selling price.
The bid for Bayview Quarries Ltd.
was another implementation of a policy
initiated apparently in 1961, whereby
Boral Ltd. secures its lines of supply
and ties up its customers.
At 1966 balance date, the breakdown
of Boral assets was:
% of net
assets, and
excluding
% of total outside
assets. Interests*

During the latest year to June, in-
vestments with book value of $2.26m.
were sold, and most of the proceeds
were used to buy more shares in Ansett
Transport Industries, in which Boral
was already the largest shareholder.
Ansett is the largest user of. oil in Aus-
tralia.
Acquisition of BHP By-Products for
a share exchange in March, 1963, gave;
Boraf control of the largest road-sur-
facing company in N.S.W. With sub-
sequent purchases of BHP shares at
opportune times, Boral is now the larg-
est individual shareholder in BHP. As
BHP is the second largest shareholder
in Boral, Boral sees a community of
interest in the possible discovery of oil
as well as gas off Victorian shores. BHP
has no refinery, Boral,has no crude oil
sources of its own.
Boral is only a junior in the big
league of world oil politics. Its financial
association with California Texas Oil
Co. Ltd. has been watered from a 40
to 14 percent shareholding, as Caltex
did not take up its entitlements when
Boral issued for the many recent take-
overs. Boral still gets its crude oil from
Caltex (UK), except for the Moonie
oil which it is' obliged to buy at a
price considerably above the ruling
price of overseas oil.
The net tangible asset backing has
been strengthened from 89c per 50c
share to over $2.00, and it seems reas-
onable to expect that, given fair
economic conditions, an improving
return on capital could be shown in the
next year or two.

COMMODITIES
Holding the Price of Zinc
Producers act on several fronts
ZINC producers are acting on
several fronts in an effort to avert
a further decline in prices. As
well as operating in the London Metal
Exchange and other markets, miners
are now acting to curb production.
As pointed out when the producer
price was reduced to £stg.lo2 a ton
earlier this year, the producers have
lately become more concerned with
supporting prices than with depressing
them. And the benefits of their actions
are clear when the £2O a ton gap be-
tween the producer zinc price and the
London Metal Exchange lead price is
considered.
The lead market, because of the
importance of scrap supplies, is out-
side the control of producers to a large
extent. In general the lead and zinc
markets would move in concert —bar-
ring outside influence.
At present, however, one of the most
significant factors in the LME zinc
market is producer buying, observers
believe. This support has held prompt
(or cash) metal at the producer price
despite several downward breaks in
recent months.
The price for metal for delivery in
three months’ time is £5 or so below
the cash price, and would be lower but
for producer activity.
When the producer price was intro-
duced two years ago, LME metal was
fetching £l4O a ton and consumers
were happy when the miners set a £125
a ton level. At the time there was talk
■of an eventual cut in the producer
quote to around £9O a ton. Rising
costs in the meantime appear to have
raised this target.
F is probable that at present world
production of zinc exceeds consump-
tion. This is especially so outside the
U.S. the Vietnam war is putting
steady pressure on supplies within
America. U.S. stockpile sales are con-
tinuing and the Government’s anti-
inflation policy probably will keep
them going for the short term at
least.
In recent weeks, the fight to hold
prices entered a new phase with pro-
ducers in several countries announcing
production cuts. This step follows a
decision by the leading Western world
producers to continue to hold the £lO2
line—although, of course, no official
statement to this effect has been made.
Vieille-Montagne in Belgium was the
first to move, with the closure of two
furnaces as part of a cut in monthly
output by 900 tons. Then Cominco of
Canada announced that it would close
its “HB” mine in British Columbia
from November. Cominco officials said
the decision was taken to shut down
one of its smaller mines since “zinc
inventories were starting to increase at
a time when overseas markets for zinc
were showing some weakness.” Monthly
output is 1500 tons of zinc and 300
tons of lead.
That day Falconbridge, also of
Canada, announced a mine closure,
then Metallgesellschaft said it would
close some older furnaces and Hudson
Bay stated it would cut zinc concen-
trate „ output “because of a fall in
grade” of ore.
Electrolytic Zinc Go., Australia’s
major zinc smelter (both from its own
ore and from Broken Hill ore), recently
said that it was considering a produc-
tion cut soon. EZ produced 145,000
tons of zinc in the latest financial year,
making it one of the world’s top smel-
ters. The company said it had been
represented at a recent meeting of
producers in Brussels, at which it was
decided to limit production in view
of the weakness in international mar-
kets. Presumably the company’s ore
suppliers have also made similar de-
cisions.
Leading U.S. zinc producers have
denied that they are considering any
cuts in output.. In the first half of this
year domestic U.S. consumption was
134,000 tons ahead of production. So
production increases are justifiable for
the U.S. miners, but will make the
situation more difficult for foreign pro-
ducers.
The attempt by Western producers to
control markets is an interesting exer-
cise. Artificial inhibition of supplies has:
led other industries into trouble in the
past copper is an example among
the metals. On the other hand, a return
to the £6O-£7O a ton levels of 1962
would also be likely to affect output,
though it could be argued that a
recovery in use would be more accur-
ately reflected in a free market.
MINING
Export Plans for Manganese
THE tremendous growth in the Aus-
tralian iron ore industry, which
followed the lifting of the em-
bargo on exports six years ago, now
seems likely to be paralleled—though
on a smaller scale—by a rapid develop-
ment of the manganese industry. The
stimulus was provided by the recent
change in Federal Government policy
regarding manganese exports. Pre-
viously only one third of proved
additions to reserves could be ex-
ported; now, export proposals are to
be considered on the basis of individual
merit.
Whereas total imports of manganese
ore, ferro manganese and manganese
metal in 1964 cost Australia some $2.3
million compared with exports of man-
ganese ore worth $1.2 million, the
balance should now move rapidly in
Australia’s favor. Exports in 1965 were
worth approximately $1.7 million and
in 1966 are estimated at over $2 million
when at least 80,000 tons will be ex-
ported under contract.
The boost in exports in future years
should result from the development by
BHP of its vast manganese deposits at
Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpen-
taria. Reserves at Groote Eylandt are
believed to be in excess of 50 million
tons of good quality metallurgical ore
(48 percent Mn.). The Groote Eylandt
crushing plant has a capacity to produce
more than 400,000 tons of ore a year,
but initial output is expected to be
only about 200,000 tons. Even at this
lower rate, Australia’s total 1965 man-
ganese ore production will be trebled.
BHP began shipments of manganese
ore to the ferro-manganese plant at
Bell Bay operated by its subsidiary,
Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co.
Pty. Ltd., in March this year. Temco
itself is doubling output capacity from
40,000 tons to 80,000 tons to cope with
the extra supplies from Groote Eylandt.
A new plant costing $3 million is due
to come into operation next month.
Since annual demand from BHP’s iron
and steel works is currently below
40,000 tons of ferro manganese, the
company plans to export the surplus'
until local demand catches up with the
increased output probably in the 19705.
No details of export contracts for
ferro manganese have been announced
but the company is believed to be in the
final stages of negotiating the fexport
of 50,000 tons of manganese ore to
Japan. Although the port at Groote
Eylandt is small by international stan-
dards, taking only ships up to 25,000
tons, the quantity available for export
could be increased to at least 150,000
tons per annum in the near future pro-
vided satisfactory markets are obtained.
The U.S.A. must also be considered a
potential market, since U.S. domestic
output of manganese is negligible in
relation to consumption. U.S. imports
in 1965 totalled 2.55 million tons of
manganese ore principally from Brazil,
Congo, Ghana, Gabon, and India. Con-
sumption of manganese ore in the U.S.
was at record levels of 2.5 million tons
in 1965 compared with 2.1 million in
1964. •
Prior to the development of
Eylandt, the main source of Australian
manganese production and ex-
ports was Western Australia, although
all other States and the Northern Ter-
ritory have produced smaller quantities.
The most important Western Australian
deposits are located in the Pilbara

about beauty
Copper and its alloys, brass
and bronze, are ideal for home
decoration because of their
ageless beauty and dura-
bility. Copper fire hoods,
bronze screens and copper
or brass light fittings will
tastefully complement any
setting period or contem-
porary.
about economy
Copper pipes never rust; are
light, flexible and easy to bend
or fit. For new cold water
services or renewals, they
reduce time and labour costs
for installation and give a life-
time of trouble-free service
because COPPER IS FOR
KEEPS!

A copper or bronze hot water unit
like all-copper plumbing is your
best low cost insurance against

region the centre of the major iron
ore developments. Here proven reserves
containing more than 40 percent are
of the order of 1 million tons.
However, considerable quantities of
lower-grade ore are associated with
these reserves and many deposits have
not yet been assessed. The Peak Hill
district, approximately 300 miles to the
south, has in the past been the main
producing area of the State, but
reserves are thought to be fairly limi-
ted. Other deposits occur in the Ravens-
thorpe district about 150 miles east of
Esperance.
The principal Western Australian
producers are Westralian Ores Pty.
Ltd. (a subsidiary of Bell Bros. Hold-
ings Ltd.) and Mt. Sydney Manganese
Pty. Ltd. (formerly Northern Mineral
Syndicate). These two companies have
been shipping manganese ore in bulk
from the ports of Geraldton and Port
Hedland for the past 14 years. Most
production has been sold to Japan, with
smaller tonnages going to Germany
and also to BHP prior to the develop-
ment of Groote Eylandt. Firm con-
tracts are held for the supply of
80,000 tons to Japan in 1966, compared
with total Australian exports of 65,800
tons in 1965 and 52,800 tons in 1964.
'J'HE Bell Bros, subsidiary, Westralian
Ores Pty. Ltd., has held manganese
mining leases since 1948 in both the
Peak Hill (Horseshoe) and Pilbara
(Skull Springs) areas. The mining of
manganese is making an important
contribution to profits and provides
valuable tax concessions to the group.
In the Bell Bros, prospectus last year,
directors commented that there were
indications of an increasing demand
for manganese at firm prices. At that
stage the company already held export
contracts worth over $400,000 for the
1965/66 year and a special order for
low-grade ore was finalised with Japan
during the year.
Another company which could be-
come a substantial producer of man-
ganese in the Pilbara region is the
Sentinel Mining Co., a member of the
D. K. Ludwig group. This company has
extensive reserves of manganese near
its iron ore deposits at Nimingarra,
approximately 40 miles south-east of
Mount Goldsworthy.
The Ludwig group has been negotia-
ting with the Western Australian
Government during the past 18 months
on plans for the development of the
deposits, a railway, and a port site. It is
believed that the group has already
reached an agreement to sell iron ore
to the Japanese steel mills. Develop-
ment of the nearby manganese deposits
could be expected to follow iron ore
production.
It seems reasonable to predict further
growth in manganese production from
the Pilbara region of Western Aus-
tralia. With the construction of rail-
ways and port facilities in this area
by the various iron ore partnerships,
the economics of manganese production
must have improved considerably.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Steady, but not Dynamic
Chemical Materials now a cyclical stock
CURRENTLY the shares of Chemi-
cal Materials Limited are selling
at $1.20 to give an immediate
dividend yield of 6.25 percent, and at
11.1 times 1965/66 earnings after ad-
justment. The shares have been selling
as low as $1.15 this year, which is only
three cents above last year’s low point.
Yet, according to the preliminary an-
nouncement, net profit before tax for
1965/66 was 31 percent higher than
in 1964/65.
The history of this particular com-
pany is a rather curious one and there
is no guide to the future from the past
in this particular case. The original
company was known as Smith Wylie
(Australia) Limited and was formed
apparently to carry on the business
which today many Sydney newspapers
call “merchant banking.” The only
investment which Smith Wylie made,
and which survived the depression of
the nineteen-thirties, was a company
called Independent Oil Industries. This
company subsequently changed its
name to Purr-Pull Industries; in 1954
its oil-distribution business was acquired
by H. C. Sleigh. This acquisition left
Purr-Pull with 740,000 shares in H. C.
Sleigh, $200,000 in cash, a wholly
owned subsidiary called Chemical
Materials Pty. Ltd. and a 50 percent
interest in Dussek Bros. (Aust.) Pty.
Ltd. So far as Smith Wylie (Australia)
was concerned, the one investment
had paid off handsomely in the end,
but it had been necessary to wait 20
years for the end.
shareholders must have been
very satisfied at the time, for in
1955, and again in 1959, H. C. Sleigh
shares were distributed in specie and
each shareholder seems to have received
11 H. C. Sleigh shares for every five
shares originally held in Purr-Pull. The
distribution was done in a very com-
plicated manner, involving the can-
cellation of old shares and the issue
of new shares in Purr-Pull; this is now
only historical, for apparently this par-
ticular method of achieving a tax-free
distribution is no longer open.
The company started to acquire
other relatively small companies, the
first being Alderson Products Pty. Ltd.
in 1958. Chronol Industrial Chemicals
and Decol Detergents were acquired in
1959, and Alex Minter and Co. in 1961.
After this, and also in 1961, Maclac
Holdings and Maclac Products were
acquired. In the same year the half
interest in Dussek Bros. (Aust.) was
sold to Dussek Bros, of the U.K., the
other partner in the company.
Maclac was a problem at the outset
because, in November, 1961, it was
announced that the group was trading
at a loss and considerable reorganisa-
tion would take place to put it on to a
profitable basis. This was achieved
within a year, although in 1961/62 a
trading loss of $22,000 was incurred.
The paint and lacquer manufacturing
division of Maclac was sold, so there is
a presumption that this division was the
main cause of the problems.
During the 1963/64 year an arrange-
ment was entered into with Quaker
Chemical Corporation, of Pennsylvania,
U.S.A., which resulted in the formation
of Quaker Chemical (A’asia) Pty. Ltd.,
in which the U.S.A. company holds 51
percent of the equity and Chemical
Materials 49 percent. The first dividend
by this company was declared in
1965/66, and Chemical Materials’ share
was about $6,000.
The operations of the group now
seem to depend on the successful mar-
keting of quite a large range of pro-
ducts, but largely of surface active
agents. The back page of the annual
report lists 56 industries which are
supplied by the Chemical Materials
group. Such a large range as this would
indicate the likelihood of considerable
stability in profitability. To some
extent this is borne out by the figures
for net profit before tax and deprecia-
tion over the past four years. If the
dividends received from H. C. Sleigh
and from Quaker Chemical (A’asia)
are eliminated, then the figures are as
follows:
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Net profit before
tax, deprec. ($’000) 239 285 280 272 330
Total capital excl.
investments at start
of year ($’000) 2150 2108 2185 2255 2434
Return thereon % 11.1 13.5 12.8 12.1 13 6
After making adjustments in respect
of the bonus content of the last rights
issue and basing the earnings figure on
net profit before tax, the trend in
per share earnings becomes as follows:
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Cents per share 6.5 8 4 10 0 9.6 8 2 10.8
No marked growth is evident from
these figures, but some allowance must
also be made for the losses of Maclac
in 1960/61 and 1961/62. This would
tend to make the trend even flatter
than it is at the moment. There is
no apparent reason for the slight dip in

Accepting the judgments which have
been made above, Chemical Materials
can only be classified as a cyclical

seems likely to be steady rather than
dynamic. In such circumstances, a
price/earnings multiple of 11.1 could
be a little on the high side, yet I think
it is justified because of the seeming
immunity to fluctuations in the econ-
omy.

MAN ON THE LAND
U.S.A. and the Live Cattle Ban
PRESIDENT JOHNSON’S remark
at the Canberra barbecue, that
Australia would not let any sheep
(Merino) be exported to America and
would not permit America to send
cattle here, may have been something
chosen at random because it more or
less fitted the occasion. Then again it
may have been intended to pave the
way for the American onslaught (which
is definitely coming) against our cattle
import restrictions.
The President, even though the LBJ
ranch itself is only about 400 acres and
as a grazing enterprise could hardly
pay, is a man close to big cattle ranch-
ing interests in U.S.A. He began his
political career, let it be remembered,
as secretary to one of the Klebergs,
owners of the vast King Ranch. While
he has many more important things
than cattle on his mind these days, and
while his own business interests are
mainly television and broadcasting, it
seems reasonable to suppose that he still
maintains personal links with many big
ranchers.
There is much evidence to suggest
that American stud-cattle breeders see
Australia as a potential market. All
that stands in their way is the ban on
live cattle imports dating from 1958.
Although semen can be brought here,
if properly certified, there is a sound
practical reason why this is having
little impact on beef breeding,
To inseminate a cow artificially it
is necessary that the cow be at least
reasonably docile. Any dairy cow, used
to being put in the bails, can be insem-
inated easily. But on large grazing
properties, and particularly those in
the north, the cows just do not get
that kind of handling and the expense
would not be justified,
The cattle which American breeders
want to send here would almost cer-
tainly be destined for the north. There
is nothing to suggest that they are par-
ticularly keen to get into the 'stud
business here in a big way in the south,
What they want to do is to send out
cattle which will improve, or cattle
they think will improve, the herds
destined for the canned meat route to
North America.
There is, in all this, just a faint sug-
gestion of “playing at cowboys.” This
is not meant unkindly. It simply does
seem that some of the big. American
investors in northern cattlelands are
re-living their youth when the Great
Plains were uncluttered and the cow-
boy rode the lone prairie on a horse
and not in a Cadillac. It is just as well
that they do have a lot of money.
Instead of criticising them we should
try to understand why it is that they
have such unbounded faith in them-
selves and their livestock. It is an atti-
tude that has grown from many
things the wealth and power of the
United States, the belief that Texas
is the tail that wags the dog, the place
of the Wild West in American folk-
lore.
When Britain was at the apex of her
empire there was a saying: “What’s
good is English and what isn’t ain’t.”
To illustrate the American belief in
what is Amei'ican, consider the case of
the rancher, bound for Australia, who,
unable to bring his cattle here under
any circumstances, did the next thing.
He decided to bring his beloved Texas
quarter horses here. His journey has
been a modern odyssey. The serpents
all wear ’white coats.
The ship touched at Le Havre and,
at the time, swamp fever had broken
out in France. Therefore British
authorities took the stand that the
quarter horses could not seek refuge
in Britain for the quarantine necessary"
before they come on to Australia. An
order went out that all 40 horses must
be destroyed. After strong entreaties, a
reprieve was granted and special quar-
antine facilities were found, at great
expense no doubt to the American
rancher. When the horses complete
their English quarantine there will still
be the problem of getting them into
Australia. The call at Le Havre might
easily create a situation in which Aus-
tralian authorities could rule the
quarantine in England out of order.
'J'HE real point to the whole story is
that the quarter horse, while a hand-
some and spirited steed, possesses re-
markable and unusual qualities only
in the eyes of his enthusiasts. A noted
American authority, a Dr. Estes, some
years ago exploded the quarter-horse
legend by tracing most of the present-
day strains to discards from 20th-
century American racetracks, instead of
the fabled foundation stock said to have
existed at the time the West was tamed.
The quarter-horse enthusiasts were
naturally furious. Non-enthusiasts were
jubilant. Most people wondered what
all the fuss was about.
Still, we hope that the fellow who is
bringing his quarter horses to Australia
makes it. If all quarantine regulations
are observed he has a good chance.
What we really mean is: if all quaran-
tine officers are satisfied that regulations
have been observed. Is there a differ-
ence? We realise as well as anyone
that Australia is vulnerable to outbreaks
of various livestock diseases, but at the
same time we have long been puzzled
by some aspects of these same regula-
tions.
Remember the blue tongue scare in
Queensland about a year ago? Cattle

were slaughtered, compensation (we
trust) was paid, a fellow who had
smuggled in some Charolais semen was
hauled into court and punished and, re-
markably, tissue had to be sent to South
Africa for analysis. It turned out that
it was harmless. The necessity to send
it to South Africa was probably the
most puzzling aspect of the entire epi-
sode.
We have pursued this one and at
long last have found a possible explan-
ation. According to one American beef
breed organisation it has never been
shown that blue tongue can be trans-
mitted from cattle to sheep. (It is not
a disease of cattle; it is claimed that
cattle can be carriers.) The only place
in the world where there has been an
experiment even suggesting that cattle
can be carriers is South Africa, in 1946.
According to this argument, and it
must be conceded that it is an Ameri-
can Breed Society viewpoint, one scien-
tist in South Africa was able to inject
the disease into the bloodstream of a
cow and succeeded in showing that the
virus was present in the blood even
though no symptoms were evident in
the animal. The South African scientist
then concluded that the disease could
be transferred from cattle to sheep.
'J'HE American Breed Society is now
in the process of questioning the
entire blue tongue theory. Well, they
can do that. It is, after all, a society of
breeders interested in finding markets
for their cattle in Australia, Argentina,
Brazil, and many other parts of the
world. Remember, however, these
cattlemen can pull a few strings and,
if their story is correct, they are
entitled to pull all the strings they can.
If the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture can be prevailed upon to undertake
new exhaustive tests, and if the new
tests blow out the South African theory,
could Australia still ban American
cattle because they are supposed to be
blue tongue carriers?
If, say, the U.S. dropped the 25
percent tariff on Australian wool, would
it not perhaps be good business to let
in American beef cattle? The one
thing certain in all of this is that
American breeders are chafing under
restrictions, imposed by other countries,
which are holding them back. Being
Americans they are, whether we like
it or not, in a better position to do
something about it than breeders else-
where who are chafed just as badly.
America has the money.
If we are cynical about this it is
because too many matters related to
quarantines generally just will not stick.
The quarantine war between Australia
and the Netherlands, involving rulings
against Dutch bulbs countered by rul-
ings against Australian meat countered
by rulings against Dutch cheese, and so
on, has reached the absurd stage. It is
not at all surprising that the Depart-
ment of Health is currently advertising
for a journalist cum public relations
man capable of “developing and main-
taining, through all media, an informa-
tion program on human and animal
quarantine activities.”

A New Order in the CSIRO
FROM the heartland of science in
this country has come a book
which tells us how it all got
started. Entitled “The Origins of
CSIRO,” it was commissioned to mark
the jubilee of the Commonwealth Gov-
-ernment’s involvement in scientific re-
search. On March 16, 1916, Billy
Hughes’ Cabinet formed an Advisory
Council of Science and Industry. This
fathered our existing colossus. The
book describes the machinations of men
of science, government, and affairs from
Federation to the event in 1916 and on
till 1926, when the Science and Indus-
try Research Act was signed by Lord
Bruce. From then to almost now,
Commonwealth-sponsored research has
been relatively well-endowed finan-
cially.
The book contains a litany of famous
and half-forgotten names: Littleton E.
Groom, long-time parliamentarian and
proponent of scientific agriculture,
David Orme Masson, sometime Pro-
fessor of Chemistry in the University
of Melbourne, Frederick W. Hagel-
thorn, one-time Victorian Minister for
Agriculture, W. Russell Grimwade,
full-time captain of industry, and so
on to a hundred or more others. All
the names are spelled out of the
builders of our bastion of science.
Many people, including farmers, im-
pressed by the organisation’s manifold
contributions to science and industrial
technology in both its primary and
secondary arms, may be tempted to
spend their hard-won dollars and well-
deserved repose on it. They will be
maddened if they do. Unfortunately,
the book is dreadfully tedious. This
judgment is not intended to disparage
the efforts of the hard-working authors,
Sir George Currie, sometime research
scientist in CSIRO, and Mr. John
Graham, presently officer-in-charge of
the Organisation’s records.
From the general reader’s point of
view their fault is their scrupulousness.
They have produced a book which the
serious student of political science may
appreciate. Apparently, they ransacked
the minutes of scores of committee
meetings, combed Hansard and news-
paper columns, re-read hundreds of old
letters and memoranda, both private
and official, and even consulted the
memories of the surviving participants.
Altogether, the book exemplifies re-
search itself slow, painstaking, and
pointless except to those already en-
folded in the cult.
A N opportunity has been missed to
explain to the man on the land
and the man in the street one of the
most remarkable developments of
modern times the creation of a
politically insulated and privileged
place in the public process for the prac-
titioners of basic research. Sir David
Orme Masson stood his ground firmly
against two Prime Ministers (Hughes
and Bruce) on this matter and once
resigned his leadership role on the
Advisory Council rather than give way.
He settled for nothing less than exemp-
tion from Public Service control and
the establishment of independent
national laboratories run by scientists
for scientists. His ideology, seemingly,
was simple: the community composed
of the toilers and moneymakers may
expect but must not insist upon a pay-
off from scientific research and must
support to the best of its ability the
country’s research potential. Moreover,
if choices must be made, then the
’Scientists must be left to make them.
In recent times the productive
people, notably the primary producers,
have contrived means of protecting
themselves at least to some extent
through the various industry levy
schemes from the untrammelled
vehemence of this philosophy. The en-
clave upholding this traditional stance
is now being battered as never before
as new views gain the ascendency.
Under the press of economics, the
clamor of a starving world, and the
drive for rapid national development,
this country’s technical prowess is being
bent more and more toward solutions
for the here and now rather than
continuing the expansion of the sum
of fundamental knowledge that may
or may not ultimately have social
and economic import.
The Organisation’s latest annual re-
port complains that interference by
the producers has now reached the

point where the freedom of the
scientists to get on with their own
self-appointed jobs is being seriously
hampered. And the day has arrived
when proposals are afoot and millions
of dollars earmarked for strengthen-
ing regional, i.e., problem-directed re-
search. Federal money, which until
only a few years ago, would have
found its way into CSIRO, is now
being channelled in growing streams
into the universities for teaching and
research.
Clearly, the old order is changing.
The dominance of the scientific interest
is making place for the public interest.
Perhaps the implicit lessons in the
book will help some people to make
the necessary adjustments. One lesson,
for instance, appears to be that the
fathers of science, while piously pro-
fessing an abhorrence of politics and
by never ceasing to remind the lay-
people that they did not understand
science, managed to outwit the politi-
cians at their own game. Masson et al,
in certain fields anyway, proved to be
as adroit in politics as the irascible
Billy himself. The careful and critical
reader may, after all, be able to
squeeze more out of this book than
would appear possible on first sight.

Division among the Experts
Shocks or bright lights for the U.S. market
THERE are two schools of thought about the American stock market. The first
believes the 250-point fall since the beginning of the year is only the beginning
and further shocks are in the offing. This group is headed by the chartists.
The other school sees only bright lights ahead. The fundamentalists are the back-
bone of this group.
The chartists point out that a 25-
year uptrend in the Dow Jones index
has been decisively broken. The impli-
cation could be that a depression is
around the corner. If so, the very im-
pressive profit figures recorded in
recent years will be shattered. So much,
then, for apparently low price earnings
ratios.
The fundamentalists, on the other
hand, are confident that a bull market
will develop from the present base.
They do not consider the sudden re-
covery in the Dow Jones index from
750 to 795 to be just a technical rally.
Instead they regard it as the beginning
of a broad, sustained move that could
carry the index up, breaking through
the several resistance levels as easily
as they were broken on the way down.
It is their belief that prosperity in the
United States will continue, even
though growth in company profits may
be at a slower rate than it has been in
the past.
If economic conditions do remain at
all favorable in the United States,
many of the individual share prices do
look cheap. Even more so when meas-
ured against our own apparently de-
pressed market. Most of our more
substantial stocks are selling at a price
of at least ten times earnings; some,
such as BHP, are up around twenty
times earnings. Compare this with the
following American companies:
Companies Price Earnings
Ratio
Borg Warner 8
Ford Motor 7
Monsanto 10
New York Central Railroad 7
Rheem 6
St. Regis Paper g
U.S. Steel 8
All these companies are probably
known to Australian investors and yet
not one sells on a price earnings ratio
above 10.
The chartists have not confined
their pessimism to the American market.
One prominent Australian chartist has
most stocks on the sell list. One in par-
ticular that has been singled out is
Peko Wallsend. The impact of this
recommendation was sudden and
severe a 40 cent fall in the past
three weeks.
Whether a company is doing well or
badly, there’ll always be price fluctua-
tions. But one must expect some limit
to these fluctuations where the com-
pany has made and should continue
to make steady progress. Peko’s profits
have risen in every year since 1960. As
for the future, any decrease in profits
from copper sales (assuming a fall in
the price of copper) should be more
than offset by the increase in dividend
from the 50 percent-owned Rutile and
Zircon Mines (Newcastle) Ltd. This
associate company will receive a con-
siderably higher price for its rutile
when the contract with du Pont is re-
negotiated next year. As for gold, world
liquidity problems are likely to keep
the focus on this metal. My 200 shares
were bought for $2.06.
I have also had a week of buying
back into companies that had not long
been out of the portfolio. The second
purchase was 1000 United Uranium
fully paid shares at 56 cents. While
the 20 cent contributing shares have
moved up from 27 cents to 37 cents,
the old shares have hardly budged. Mr.
Blake Pelly, the chairman of Mary
Kathleen Uranium, has again expressed
his surprise at the high price of his
shares. I wonder what his reaction
would be if he received a takeover
bid of $4 or so a share?
r pHE one sale this week was the
Macquarie Broadcasting. Now back
up to almost its peak, the sale resulted
in a $36 profit.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
409 Macquarie Broadcasting 1.26 $494
BOUGHT
200 Peko Wallsend 2.06 $421
1000 United Uranium .56 $573
Still a balance of $430 in the account.
I never managed to get close to James
Wallace (now 29 cents), so I’ll just
have to sit on the sidelines and wait
for this stock.

BMC says horse and buggy springs and old-fashioned
shock absorbers belong to history. BMC has har-
nessed fluid forces to tame road surfaces like no
other suspension system you can buy. Hydrolastic*
float on fluid suspension they call it. How does it
work? All wheels are connected; fluid actually pro-
vides corrective forces from front to back. Result:
no bounce, no pitch, no roll a firm, level ride like
you’ve never known it. Additional advantage: no
moving parts to wear and rattle, no maintenance.
Hydrolastic* suspension is one of the unique features
that makes your BMC buy more comfortable, longer
