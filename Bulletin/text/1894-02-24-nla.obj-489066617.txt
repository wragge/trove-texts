“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly— Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and if is.
tinctire Austral inn National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System —one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobilitj. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is riot
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin,
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It- had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the chums of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land,-America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushrnan of the -Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations thi cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

“To W. H. Soul & Co., (Agents for Dr.
Pierce’s Belts and Trusses), 158 Pitt St.,
Sydney: Sirs:—l am in receipt of Belt
and books of instruction, and can safely
say that your advertisements are very truthful in regard to
the statement that a man feels the electrical strength of
thebeltassoon asit isplacedon his bcdy, for I felt the effect
of the belt as soon as I placed it on, and believe me, I am
a sure advocate of this belt.’
From England. ..
Mr. Chas. Middleton, of No. 76 Aston bt., Birmingham,
speaks as follows: “I can say that I have felt better, a great
deal, since! have used your Galvanic Cham Belt, and I
thank you very much. I have taken patent medicines but
I shall not take any more. You can use my name in praise
of your Belt.” From America.
Mb J W.Pohlman, Tacoma, U.S. A., writes— Your No.

could not do, forit has cured me of bciatic Rheumatism
and Weak Back, also, which came * :l £*£ ] f

A Legal Fiction.
The grand old British law, inherited by
Australia in the primeval days of chains and
darkness, is full of moral precepts, and is
loaded down with much beautiful theory
which is seldom put into practice. There
are few things more lofty and strictly
equitable—in theory—than these statutes of
our British forefathers. They are spotted
; over with axionis which are elevating to
contemplate, and with great principles which
are a liberal education in the doctrine of
justice. One of the noblest of these is
the hackneyed assertion that the law
holds every man to be innocent until he is
proved guilty, and that it not only treats
him accordingly, but requires the general
public to do likewise—so far, at least, as
outward observances are concerned. Its
great object, according to legend and public
conviction, is to secure for every suspected
citizen an absolutely fair trial, and, with this
end in view, it professes to fall with all its
massive weight on anybody who endeavours
to prejudice the minds of the court or the
jury. The newspaper man who, in the
mildest manner, assumes the guilt of the
unconvicted prisoner—at least, when the un-
convicted prisoner is a bank magnate, or
other person of money and influence, and
is able to hire expensive counsel to bring the
matter before the court —gets into gaol with
promptitude and certainty ; though, strange
to say, the one who gratuitously assumes
his innocence does not. What would
happen to the journal which headed its
report of the preliminary proceedings
against a representative citizen with the bald
announcement: “ Arrest of a notorious bank-
thief,” no one dare even imagine. The fact
that the law treats every suspect as an inno-
cent man until his guilt is proved is so well-
known that no paper ever runs such a risk.
That is to say, no paper ever does, unless
the suspect is a man of no importance and
has not the means to hire counsel.
• • *
But when the suspect is a common, vulgar
person, charged with a small, mean offence
—when he isn’t in society, and can’t hire
expensive counsel to fall upon the paper
that is guilty of “ contempt,” and when ho
can’t get bail, and is altogether a suspect of
no account—then the noble axiom above
alluded to utterly falls through. Among the
suspects whoso cases are still sub judice, and
whom the law is especially bound to treat as
innocent men in every way except by letting
them get beyond its jurisdiction, the most
notorious at present .are Matthew Davies
and his colleagues at one end of the social
scale, and at the other the two alleged bur-
glars whose arrest made such a sensation the
other day in Sydney. These latter are charged
with burglary in the first place, and with
assault upon certain constables in the
second. But until their crime is proved by
legal process the law doesn’t know, and pro-
fessedly doesn’t allow anyone else to know,
that they have done anything illegal. It is
as absolutely unlawful for any newspaper to
say that they burgled an office and nearly
murdered five policemen as it would be for
the same paper to say, in so many words, that
Matthew Davies, or anybody else of the
same standing, perpetrated a shameless fraud
on the Mercantile Bank shareholders. In
each case it would be assuming the guilt of
an untried man, and prejudicing the minds
of the jury, and grossly libelling a legally
innocent person, and also committing an
aggravated contempt of court. And no
paper dare do these things in the case of the
“ representative ” banker. But every paper
does them constantly and with absolute im-
punity in the case of the alleged burglar or
any other common offender. The law per-
mits anything to be said about a man who
can’t hire a fifty-guinea counsel to draw its
attention to his wrongs.
• * *
When a person of no wealth or social im-
portance is arrested on a sensational charge,
the course of events is always much the
same. There is an urgent demand among
the daily horror-mongers for his portrait,
and if, as often happens, it can’t be obtained
at short notice, any other brutal-looking
portrait does instead. It matters very little
whose portrait it is so long as it is brutal-
looking. The beetle-brow on this awful
production is, in itself, sufficient to
make a fair trial impossible. The misshapen
ears are a living prejudice, and the vulpine
eyes an epitome of lynch law. The gorilla-
like underjaw is perjured evidence against
the defendant. No editor ventures, by any
chance, to publish the portrait of some
hanged Thug as that of the eminent director
who is suspected of misappropriation, and, if
he did, that law which regards every man as
innocent till he is found guilty would
promptly suppress him. But the other man
can be represented by a picture which carries
murder, arson and cannibalism in every
lineament, and the circumstance creates nob
even a ripple on the Dead Sea of public
opinion.
« * *
In the case of the sensational alleged
burglar the ordinary newspaper report is
equally an outrage upon the nominal priciples
of the law. “ The prisoner was seen issuing
from certain premises. . . . He resisted
violently and felled the officer with a jemmy.
. . . After a furious struggle, in which
two constables were disabled, he was at
length captured. . . . On being searched
at the watch-house a quantity of house-
breaking implements were found in his pos-
session. . . . He has since been recog-
nised as a notorious offender with a long list
of previous convictions,” &c. These are the
sort of statements wi ich are to be found in
any daily paper whenever a suspect of the
ordinary humble type is concerned. Yet,
according to the noble maxims of Anglo Aus-
tralian justice, the law doesn’t know, until
it learns from the verdict of the jury,
whether the defendant was seen coming out
of an office, or out of his own house, or out
of anywhere ; it is totally unaware whether
the officer was brained with a jemmy or
whether he wilfully knocked out his own
intelligence by dashing it against a wall ; it
has no knowledge whether there was any
struggle at all, whether anything was found
on the prisoner, and—unless he announces
his own identity—whether he is a notorious
offender, or merely the Chief Justice who has
been arrested by mistake while out walking
at night in company with the local Bishop or
the Cardinal. All the stereotyped news-
paper assertions are merely the ex parte
statements of the prosecution—that is, of
the police. Therefore, the papers which
publish them as facts simply declare in
advance that the accused is guilty, that the
statements of the prosecution are absolutely
true, that the defence—whatever it may bo
—is a lie, and that it is the bounden duty of
the jury to convict the prisoner, no matter
what evidence he may advance. Yet, if the
same papers accepted, in similar fashion, the
assertions of the prosecution in the case of
the influential bank-director, and stated off-
handedly that he had misused the funds, and
wilfully falsified the balance-sheet, and
obtained deposits under false pretences, and
had been a callous swindler generally—what
would happen ?
• • •
In the case already alluded to the prin-
ciples of equity were outraged in an even
more glaring fashion than usual. On that
occasion the bull-headed Premier Dibbs pro-
ceeded, on the very morning after the event,
to recommend for promotion the officers who
said they had distinguished themselves in the
fray. The promotion was distinctly a reward
for the capture of two dangerous male-
factors. Therefore, by his haste in sending
in the aforesaid recommendation, Dibbs
virtually announced, by actions which speak
more loudly than words, that the accused
were malefactors, that the police charges
brought against them were absolutely true,
and, as the natural consequence, that any
statements they might make in their own
defence, which contradicted these police
assertions, were absolutely false. The pro-
motions in question would have been entirely
unobjectionable after the conviction of the
prisoners—-supposing them to be convicted.
But, as things stood, they ought to have
resulted in Premier Dibrs being hauled
before the Supreme Court, and there fined,
or severely admonished, or committed to
prison for a gross act of contempt and a
constructive interference with the course of
justice. And the same punishment should
have been served out to every editor
who arrogated to himself the rights of the
jury by finding the prisoners guilty without
trial, and thereby proceeded to systematically
create a public feeling which must inevit-
ably make a fair trial impossible.
# # #
The person who assumes, and incites the
public to assume, the guilt of an untried
man, and thereby interferes with the course
of justice to procure his conviction, is
morally just as criminal as the one who
bribes a jury and thereby interferes witli
the course of justice to procure his acquittal.
Also, his offence arises from equally
base and mercenary motives; the “jury-
fixer” does his work for cash payment
from the accused, while the owner of
the sensational newspaper does his for cash
payment derived from the extra circulation
of his daily horror. Further, his offence is
aggravated by the fact that it is never com-
mitted except against a poor and friendless
suspect. The court never interferes in such
cases except when it is officially moved to
do so by an array of high-priced counsel.
Therefore, this gross perversion of justice is
always carefully directed against the prisoner
who is too impecunious to obtain bail, so
that—being in prison and cut off from the
outer world—he has practically no knowledge
of the injury that is being done him ; and
who, even if he should become aware
of it, is too poor to take measures for
his own protection. It is a mean, degrad-
ing, wormy offence which is invariably
directed against the man who is already
defenceless, and never against the one who
is in a position to protect himself. In every
respect the assertion that the law treats every
prisoner as innocent until his guilt is proved
is a lie, so far as any save the wealthy
prisoner is concerned. And, further, it
always has been a lie, and, to all appearance,
it always will be one so long as there are
poor and rich in the land.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Chessplay for Seaboards.
The combinations on the European chessboard
are developing startling variations. It is com-
monplace comment to assert that the latest
tariff reciprocity between Germany and Russia
is a Bismarckian move intended to isolate
France, but there are far deeper significances
behind. A counter-move, mysteriously inspired,
is an effort at commercial rapport between
Italy and France. The commonplace observa-
tion on that is that the Triple Alliance of
Germany, Austria, and Italy seems to be un-
stranding. But all these matters are a part of
the great grabs that are being made at seaboard.
Austria warred with Italy for seaboard and
annexed some Adriatic provinces. The Crimean
war was, in reality, not a dispute as to churches,
but one in which Russia acquisitively desired
an always open outlet tor her fleets into the
Mediterranean. So with the Russo-Turkish
war. Germany bought Heligoland from Britain
in order that the Baltic might be her own
free sea, but the Baltic is not all that Germany
desires, since it is easily blockaded, even with-
out Heligoland. Germany has acquired a
diplomatic suzerainty over Holland, because of
the latter’s grand seaboard. Some day Holland
w’ill be a German State, if the fates be propi-
tious. It was Germany that really put forward
Holland’s claim to Dutch New Guinea. British
statesmen have fallen into the trap of German
alliances blindfold. Barkis Bismarck was
willing. Barkis Bismarck was so willing that
he entered into friendly rivalry with J. Bull
in the colonising areas of the world, and
the two States have advanced side by
side and stride for stride in Africa. And
Germany and Britain are the two great rivals
for the supremacy of the Pacific. Russia, on
the other hand, has bluntly been Britain’s foe,
and endeavoured to gain seaboard somewhere
or other by force of arms. Failing the Bos-
phorus, it wrenched Vladivostock from China.
Moving unfalteringly towards Afghanistan, it
means to try for an Indian Ocean seaboard.
Bailing that, it can branch off into the Persian
Gulf. Seaboard it will have. If Britain and
other European Powers let Russia take Con-
stantinople, the Indian aggressiveness would be
abandoned. The friendliness between Germany
and Russia may have this chess-ending : “ You
help me in my designs on Holland, and I’ll
help you auent Constantinople. Let Austria
wilt.” Italy’s move towards France is a clear
case of hedging, in view of possible danger.
The real key to the whole problem is the
isolation, not of France, but of Britain, Yet,
it may bo that France, of all seeming present
probabilities, will once more be the ally of
“perfidious Albion,” It is Germany that is
Britain’s unsleeping enemy.

Patterson’s Land of Promise,
The windy Ministry of Patterson continues
to witch Victoria with its settled policy of
puff and blow, and the things which it was
going to do, and didn’t, promise to outnumber
the hairs on its chieftain’s scalp. From the
time when Patterson and Carter undertook
to save the banks by “cordial co-operation”
the history of this remarkable Government has
been that of an impotent volcano, ever smoking
and spluttering and rumbling ominously, but
throwing up naught save a little dust and
ashes. Patterson was going to construct a
“ necessary' railway,” or two, and didn’t. He
talked of importing an American railway-
expert ami dropped -the idea directly it began
to bum his lingers. He was making arrange-
ments to carry on the Agent-General’s office
without an A.G. when suddenly Giddies was
inserted into the empty nest. He swore
not to let Davies leave for Colombo, but
Davies enjoyed his trip all the same.
The despatch of a beatified butterruan
to foreign parts was said to be on the verge of
occurring, and lo ! Patterson decided not to
send the butterman at all. His invitation to
the Yorks was a mere gilding of the dome of the
Invalides—a mere pretence of doing something.
Adapting himself to the new meat mania he
proposed to erect Government freezing works
in Melbourne, and so “ devclope a great in-
dustry,” but he now truly slates that private
independent action is the one thing necessary
for the meat trade. All round the country he
rants and roars over the free banquet-table
his intention to put the finances straight, the
while that he knows they are getting daily
more crojik, and he keeps Parliament shut up to
prevent the possibility of a land or property
tax doing any damage to his precious
“popularity,” Patterson’s declaration of
sympathy for James Munro, and his avowed
scorn for the “persecutors” of Matthew
Davies, and t he hanging of Mrs. Knorr, are
probably the only things that he has stuck to
hard and fast since he started to save Victoria,
and this is a very solemn matter for considera-
tion at the present time. Premier Patterson
is bent on seeing that nobody wants for food
during the coming winter. His policy for the
moment is centred upon the task of taking care
that the pangs of hunger and cold shall be
unknown among his loyal subjects. Wherefore
by all rules of precedent it appears certain that
hundreds of people in Victoria shall presently
moan for food, clothes and tiring, inasmuch as
Patterson promises to the contrary.
Confidence Men.
By latest advices there is to be more flogging in
New South Wales. The additional crimes to
which the good old nostrum is to be applied-
provided Mr. E. M. Clark’s bill becomes law
are many, the list including :
Burglary, house-breaking, robbery from the person with
and without striking or wounding, wounding with intent
to do bodily harm or resist arrest, assaults with intent
to commit felony or on certain officers, assaults and dis-
turbances by pushes, picking pockets, and the offence
ordinarily known as the confidence'trick.
Therefore the Legislature will presently have
to sit down in a cool place and think out a
comprehensive definition of a “push” and a
“ confidence trick,” and if it is successful —
especially so far as the latter term is concerned
—it will do a good and great work, and hand
down a name which will be reverenced by
posterity. For the “ confidence trick ”is
a crime which wants to be put down
—by flogging dr otherwise worse than
any other in Australia. In a general
sense it covers any variety of swindle which
consists, first, in inspiring confidence, and then
in abusing it and leaving the confiding one
penniless, or as nearly so as possible. The suave
The Suicidal "Stigma."
A number of British divines; have signed
a petition to the Canterbury’ Convocation,
urging the Church to use its influence
upon coroners’ juries for the prevention of
suicides. Suicides have of late increased at
’Ome, owing to the rapid growth of misery, and
the petitioners (who humbly pray) consider that
the practice of finding a verdict of temporary
insanity ought to be abandoned. The good old
“ stigma ” attaching to cases of feto de se was a
Christian deterrent to self-destruction, say
these servants of God, wherefore they want to
see the “stigma” in full blast as of yore.
Many a man who now wipes himself out, upon
the assumption that he will pass muster as a
lunatic, would rather die naturally than have
his cold remains convicted of a crime with a
stigma to it. As regards the restraining custom
of cross-roads burial and fixing the corpse down
with an iron skewer, the British clergymen say
nothing straight out, though they hint at its
efficacy.—
O, restore the lost stigma attaching
To suicide once on a time,
When deeds of self-happy-despatching
Found punishment fitting the crime—
When men, with their brains in a ferment,
Made sober would speedily be
By a dread of the lonely interment
Awaiting a felo de se.
Then the ruffian bent on expiring
Would gaze at the knife in his paw,
Or blunderbuss loaded for firing,
And pause to consider the Law. {
“My word !” he exclaimed with a ■ lover,-'
“ A hole in four roads they will delve, ■
And drive a stake into my liver,
Poor deader ! exactly at twelve.”
He hacked at his throat, feeling sure he
Would go to the “ other place ” when *
The foreman who spoke for thb jury
Had d-—d him forever, Amen.
No prayers o’er his carcase weye chanted,!
No blessing was shed by a priest; ;
As a felo de se he was planted i
Away from his fellow deceas’t.
Say, why did wo part with they stigma,
The stigma druv in by the stake?
Can Charity solve this enigma,
Or Reason explain the mistake?
From the scorn of the world We exempt him,
The wretch who was certainly sane,
And thus do our hardest to tempt him s
To kill himself over again. <,
Small wonder that clergy are rising
Against this unjustified ruth !
No corpse should escape front chastising
’Through jury-perversion oft truth.
The sons of misfortune and daughters
Of shame seek nepenthe when sad ;
But only a parson who slaughters
Himself is undoubtedly mad.


individual who induces a simple-minded person
to let him hold his money, and tow r ait while he
walks round the corner and fails to come back,
is of this order. So is the influential bank-
director who, by his eloquent speeches at the
annual meeting, induces some other “ mug ” to
let the bank hold his money while it goes round
the corner on no visible security, and doesn’t
come back. The eminently pious church-
member of awful and cast-iron morality will be
floggable under this heading when he breaks up
and pays a few coppers in the £ ; the piety and
morality and the church-membership inspire
the confidence, and the subsequent burst is the
confidence-triek. The person who does a dis-
graceful swindle after for years publicly wear-
ing a shiny bell-topper and a white waistcoat
and a shaven upper-lip and a prayer-book, will
also come under the provisions of the Bill—the
bell-topper and the waistcoat are exhibited in
order to inspire confidence, just as the bogus
notes of the ordinary spieler are exhibited to
the person from the country ; the process is the
same and has the same ending. The person
whose K.C.M.G.-ship, or whose teetotalism, or
whose sympathy for the poor, misguided
heathen, or whose loyalism, or aggressive
seriousness and respectability are used to
inspire confidence, which confidence afterwards
proves to be hideously misplaced, will all
be duly skinned under this Act. It is
an Act for the castigation of bank-managers
and directors, fraudulent trustees, solicitors of
high standing, Members of Parliament, pillars
of the church, people who wear long hats and
pompous vests and who live in big stone
mansions—in short, for the castigation of the
Fat Man in general. All of which, of course,
is based on the assumption that it is interpreted
on an equitable principle which will put the
big confidence-man, who swindles in a gorgeous
office with tesselated floors and adornments of
malachite, on the same level as the small one
who swindles in the back of a fusty public-
house amid the effluvium of stale beer and old
sodden cigar stumps. But probably it will
prove in the end that it is only the latter that
Clark’s Bill is looking for, and that the
confidence-man in the massive frock-coat—for
instance, the elaborately-tailored saint who
sells, on the instalment plan, to some poor, trust-
ful ignoramus, a section of land of which he, the
vendor, has hopelessly mortgaged the deeds—
isn’t even taken into consideration.
M’Kiuuon’s Motion.
The following resolution, moved last week in
N.S.W. Assembly by M’Kinnon, M.L.A., is a
premonitory symptom of coming trouble for the
aggregate Fat Man of Australia
That in the opinion of this House the Government
should at once appoint auditors to examine and report
upon the financial position of all hanks which have availed
themselves of tire Bank Issue Act.
There is one obvious mistake in the drafting of
this resolution—it should have applied, not
only to institutions which availed themselves
of the Bank Issue Act, but to banks in general.
Also, it should cover insurance societies, and,
in short, all companies which are, entrusted
with the money of the public. The debate on
Mr. M‘Kinnon’s motion covered most of the
arguments on both sides of the question.
The case for the Lean Man—the represen-
tative of the great, aggregate, long-suffering,
much-swindled depositor, was practically this :
The private auditor is a delusion. He is
generally appointed by the directors and their
adherents, and if he goes habitually seeing
things he isn’t wanted to see he speedily loses
his billet. He is miserably underpaid—so
miserably that if he devoted sufficient time to
the accounts of a big financial concern to audit
them thoroughly, he would only earn some-
thing lik£2os. per week. And he is altogether
a mere automaton, as is demonstrated by the
fact that every rotten and utterly dishonest
financial institution which has ever collapsed
under disgraceful circumstances, in Australia,
was audited and solemnly declared, by allegedly
responsible men, to be sound right up to the
day of its decease. And, on the other
side of the question, the case for the
Fat Person, who strongly objects to being
inquired into by any process of State audit, was
expressed by Messrs. See and Wall, who rose
to state jointly that “ the majority of the banks
were thoroughly sound,” and that “ the share-
holders were sure to see that the affairs of the
bank were properly audited.” Considering the
record of the Federal, Mercantile, Commercial
ofS.A., the Real Estate Bank, the Imperial,
Anglo-Australian, V.D.L., the famous Abigail
institution, the Freehold Investment horror,
and a good many dozen others which died sim-
ply because the shareholders didn’t, and
couldn’t, and never can know whether the
accounts are properly audited or not, this latter
statement is about as brassy as anything well
can be. The one fact which sticks out
conspicuously like an accusing skeleton
out of a sepulchre, is that the ordinary
shareholder or depositor can’t, by any pos-
sibility. know whether the accounts are
properly audited or not, because he only
knows what the directors and the auditors tell
him, and they always tell him the same thing,
and the thing that they tell him is more often a
he than otherwise. As for the statement that
the majority of the surviving banks are
thoroughly sound, it rests on exactly the same
authority as the former statements that all the
dead banks were thoroughly sound till they
died, and it is advanced by much the same
crowd, and supported by the same evidence. If
the banks and the big insurance societies and
building societies and all the rest are sound,
they should be glad to have the fact demon-
strated by State inspection, and the apparent
resolution of their friends to die in the last
ditch rather than have it demonstrated is
eminently suspicious. It is possible for the
State to thoroughly audit the accounts of busi-
ness corporations. See how the United States
audits its life-assurance companies.
One of the papers tells a pathetic story of an
Australian speculative Christian. A good
many years ago a land “ shindykit,” composed
mainly of solid citizens of good religious stand-
ing, bought an “estate” and cut it up into
allotments, which were sold on the instalment
plan at several hundreds per cent, profit. One
of the purchasers was a mechanic who wanted
to make a home for himself and his family. He
bought his allotment, and for years and years,
in good seasons and bad, he persistently
scraped up the money for the monthly instal-
ment. The land-boom died - a natural death ;
and was succeeded by years of flood, and lean-
ness, and scarcity of work, and low wages, and
general desolation, but still the buyer struggled
through, and when his last instalment was
paid he asked for his deeds. Then he was
referred to a bank, where he learned that the
estate had been long , since mortgaged up
to the hair, and foreclosed upon, and, in
short, his allotment was gone, along with
many other allotments sold on the same
fraudulent principle. There was no redress
save by starting a huge equity suit against the
bank and the syndicate, and engaging an
eminent firm of solicitors, and hiring three
barristers of repute and two juniors, and paying
jury fees, and court fees, and shorthand-writer’s
fees, and costs out of pocket, and so on, and
then carrying an appeal to the Privy Council
where it would have been heard after two
years or so—consequently the home and the
result of years of toil had to go. But
now the local council has got a verdict
against the defrauded buyer for accumulated
rates on the stolen allotment—the syndicate
having allowed the rates to get into arrear and
being now dissolved and unfindable ; and the
said rates are recoverable by “distress”-—in
other words, by seizure of the unhappy pur-
chaser’s tables and chairs and his bed, all of
which are probably gone by this time. Truly,
the poor man’s thrift is the fat man’s oppor-
tunity, and the fat man advocates thrift princi-
pally because he lives thereon. Also he objects
to cheap law because it is dear law which keeps
him out of gaol.
Dear Bulletin, —“Titus Salt” has so com-
pletely anticipated the arguments with which
I had intended to confront “ Pax ” that I will
herewith only furnish some collateral evidence.
1. It is the “ emasculated ” nation that most
delights in the combat of brutes—human or
otherwise. The most masculine men the world
has ever seen—the iron Romans of the Repub-
lic—knew nothing of the “ gladiatorics ” which
increased in vogue exactly as. the national
emasculation progressed. 2. General Grant
said, “I do not consider the pugilist a really
courageous man, and I would rather take a
regiment of quill-drivers into action than a
regiment of pugilists. Within certain accus-
tomed lines, the fist-fighter is well enough—
outside them he is a brute, and a poor one
at that!” 3. Lieut.-Col. Stuart says, “It
is a curious fact, observed by not a few
commanding officers, that the men who are un-
steady in action are generally men who have a
pugilistic reputation in their regiments.” 4.
Jackson (not Peter, but “ Gentleman-JACK-
son ” of the Twenties) “ I have kept it”
(pugilism) “as decent as it could be kept, but
the best proof of its real character as a profes-
sion is that I, as a member of it, should be held
up as a miracle, for merely being a tolerably
respectable member of the community.” 5. Is
it the part of a “Spartan” to live, as many of
the obscurer pugilists do, upon the earnings of
prostitutes, of whom their professional “man-
liness ” does not forbid them to make punching-
pads on the slightest provocation?—A.
Dear Bulletin,—Y our correspondent who asks
(Feb. 10) how the exclusion of children under
six from N.S. Wales State schools will affect
the education of the next crop of adults, as
compared with those of Victoria and Queens-
land, may be answered that the country will save
much and the children will lose nothing. It is
incorrect to say that in Victoria and Queensland
children are taken at three years. The school
age is supposed to be five years in each pro-
vince, though children are sometimes sent
before, as the teacher cannot refuse to accept
the parent’s statement of age. I believe
teachers generally will agree that until six or
seven years a child is best at home with its
mother. To send children to school before six,
if they really learn anything, is to risk lower-
ing their vitality and degrading their physique,
which, at that age, should be the first considera-
tion. Many mothers have been in the habit of
thinking that the State should supply nursery
governesses to mind their infants while they
tidied the house or went shopping. Minister
Suttor is right in destroying this amiable
delusion.—Yours, Alpha.
The Separation journals of the North are
writhing in a spasm of delight, for the Lord
hath delivered their arch-enemy, the Brisbane
Courier, into their hands. In attempting to
show that the financial position of Queensland
for 1893 is sound, that organ delivered an elo-
quent piece of special pleading for Separation.
The Courier first lays down the proposition
that out of its gross exports the province first
pays for its imports, and then from the balance
pays the interest on outside debt, public and
private—the remainder, if there be any, being
profit. Now, the excess of exports over imports
for three years (1891-93) was ten and a-half
millions, of which £5,400,000 was contributed
by the Centre ; £5,104,000 by the North ; and
£BB,OOO by the South. The interest on debt
(public and private) for the same period was
also £10,500,000, of which the South paid next
to nothing- according to the Courier’s own
showing. Again, the local public debt of the
province (railways, harbours, etc.) is about
£26,000,000, of which £15,000,000 were spent
in the South ; £5,000,000 in the Centre ; and
£6,000,000 in the North. On this basis the
interest of the debt for three years should be
thus allotted : South, £6,000,000 ; Centre,
£2,000,000; North about £2,500,000 whereas
the South (vide Courier) gets off with £BB,OOO,
while the North and Centre each pays about
£5,000,000 apiece into the pocket of the foreign
usurer. No wonder the South doesn’t want
Separation. No wonder the political mention
of Philp’s name in Townsville is usually accom-
panied by a frantic howl for tar and feathers
and a substantial rail from the nearest available
fence I
♦
Two minutes’ reflection will surely show that
the shearers are right in refusing to give to or
take references from their employers. Their
case is not that of domestic servants, or of
seamen, instanced as analogous. Neither
seamen nor domestic servants have to deal with
an organised body of employers, acting from
the same motives, influenced by the same ideas,
seeking the same ends. Ship master and house-
mistress have no guide but the written reference
in choosing a sailor or a servant from the mass
of floating labour. The pastoralists have their
union, which is naturally in perpetual conflict,
patent or covert, with the shearers’ union. A
union shearer who bears a reference from one
union squatter to another plainly lights the torch
to his own destruction. Whether a system
of private marks exists or not, it is easy to
conceive that the squatter, falling as far short
of perfection as other people, may through the
reference wreak a union grudge. To be sure,
abolition of references will not prevent this,
since it is the easiest thing in the world to
create a pastoralists’ black-list, absolutely de-
barring from employment those whose names
are included. But this will involve report to
the pastoralist management, who may be trusted
to exercise some oversight, some sense of fitness
and justice. When the reference goes direct
from squatter to squatter, the shearer is lost
utterly. Even a jury of pastoralists is better
than no jury at all. If there must be a black-list,
the official list is infinitely preferable to the
private list created by the reference system.
Further, supposing that every squatter is an
angel of justice and mercy, and that the snake
of individual malice will never, never glide into
the Eden of references, the references are still
misleading and worthless. For there is no ulti-
mate criterion of merit. Some squatters like a
fast shearer, and some a slow shearer ; some
prefer one style of cutting, and some another
style; some have this standard of behaviour,
and some a standard entirely different. Of
what use can a reference from one of these
antagonistic sets of employers be to a man who

Happily there is no reason why conflict should
follow the shearers’ decision. After all, the
presence or absence of a reference does not affect
the character of the man. Every shearer was
at one time without a reference, and next season
will simply see all without —or all unionists.
Probably the squatters will prefer men with
references ; but if the shearers hold firm this
need make little difference to them. As for the
resolution not to engage through the pastoralists’
office, it appears that this practice is not
universal at present, and that shearers may
either adopt it or not. If they say “No!” on
the ground that they wish to choose their sheds,
and dislike to be marched about like puppets,
their action cannot be blamed, their right can-
not be denied.
The middleman again ! In common with all
the wheat-growing countries of the world Vic-
toria’s wheat-crop this year is excessive, and
good milling wheat can, as this is written, be
bought in Melbourne at 2s. sd. per bushel, or
lid. less than the ruling prices of 1893.
Although this should mean that the Victorian
consumer will save over a quarter of a million
on his bread bill, it is highly improbable that
this cheerful prospect will be realised when the
treatment experienced by the producer is ex-
plained. One firm secured the tonnage of
nearly all outgoing vessels as far back as Sep-
tember last, and those’producers who stand
outside the ring will have to pay at least 30s.
freight per 480 lbs. for all surplus stocks
which, iu the usual course of trade, are
exported to France. This (freight) charge must
inevitably preclude all chances of recouping the
cost of production when it is remembered that
the Chamber of Deputies has decided to impose
an import duty. The moral for the grower is
obvious. Let him limit his output to the needs
of his country, and abandon his Freetrade
notions of depending for subsistence on external
resources. The consumer, realising that he
seldom gets the benefit of local competition, can
concentrate his hungry optic on the schemes of
domestic middlemen with less unsatisfactory
results than would characterise his attempted
supervision of foreign wire-pullers on the outer
rim of the earth’s surface.
Canon Sharp (to the boys at King’s Schoob
Parramatta, N.S.W.) :
When we set aside and think not of the fear and the
love of God —when we allow large sections of our people
to sink back into virtual paganism—what wonder is it
that we should have amongst us an epidemic of fraud ?
What wonder that our public life should he degraded?
What wonder that reckless gambling and drunkenness
and impurity and larrikinism that fears not God neither
regards man should he rampant among us?
And, now, can Canon Sharp explain how it is
that it is not the backslider into paganism at all,
but the greasy saint, who affects both to fear
God and to regard man, who is the germ of the
“epidemic of fraud”—who also is the “im-
pure ” beast that, under the cloak of sanctity,
ravens on the innocence of the lambs of the
fold? It is the man who boasts that his heart
is fixed in “ the fear and the love of God ” who,
somehow or other, pulls off all the double
events of Satanism that Canon Sharp ascribes
to “virtual paganism.” That is why Canon
Sharp’s homily is just so much wasted breath
—it misplaces its denunciation.
Duncan Gillies, ere departing for his British
picnic, had the astounding gall to debit the
sins of Victoria to Australia at large. This is
commonly done by the “representative” gang
whose friends have “made Smellbourne what
it is,” but never before had the deed been per-
petrated with as much publicity and impudence.
The little oily man placed the continent under
his patronage thuswise : “A great deal that
has been said of these colonies has been said
under a misapprehension. (Cheers.) I am
confident that a great deal that has been said of
these colonies to their detriment has been said
wrongfully and unjustly, and that the best men
in the old country, those who think most of
these colonies and know most about them, will
be prepared to acknowledge that they have no
reason to doubt their honour. (Loud and pro-
longed cheering.) So far as I shall come
in contact with men of influence in the
old country, I shall always speak frankly to
them about this country.” If Duncan carries
out his promise to the letter he will frankly in-
form all and sundry that Victoria is the financial
plague-spot of Australia. And the informa-
tion will be unnecessary because the Britishers
“who know most about these colonies” are
already posted up in the facts of the scandal.
It is Victoria, and Victoria only, that stinks of
fraud, corruption, and compositions, in the
place where puny-minded Duncan will (D.V.)
soon find himself. The laws, manners, and
customs of Smellbourne are pretty well under-
stood over there, and if Duncan starts to
apologise for any province but his own it will
be the duty of Saul Samuel and brethren to
bring him back to the point, or perish in the
attempt.
The best apology for alcohol extant in a popular
form is contained in a sermon lately preached by
Minister Gibson, of Carnoustie, Scotland, from
the text, “ Wine that maketh glad the heart of
man.”—(Psalms civ., 15). He said :
The fanatical teetotaller makes a great mistake in trj'-
ing to abolish the drink traffic. Drink is a creation of
God, intended for the good of man. Alcohol has done
more good than evil in the world. For one that is killed
by it there are 100 gladdened and helped. As opium,
temperately used, is a blessing to the ryot of India, so
beer is a boon to the workman of Britain. Take it from
him, and you deprive him of one of the few solaces of his
hard existence. It is a tonic, a stimulant, and a grateful
vegetable beverage to him. Kind nature grows the barky
and the hops for the joys and the feeding of
her toil-worn children. The wine of Europe is
given by the Great Miracle-worker to cheer the hearts
of the peasantry. It makes their treadmill life possible;
nay, it renders government possible. The rabid tee-
totaller would withdraw it from their lips, but God is
more merciful. Every autumn He sends it gushing in red
rivers out of His beneficent bosom to feed and gladden
the people. When God comes to earth He Himself drinks
it, and so sanctifies its use through all time. The
strongest and greatest races of the world use it. All
great writers, thinkers, preachers, and workers, with few
exceptions, are moderate drinkers. The nations that
don’t drink are lagging in the rear of humanity. The
Mahommedan is teetotal, but he is given to opium
and sensuality. The Turk is sober, but he is the
sick man of Europe, sensual too, retrograde, and
almost moribund. He has banished the God-
planted vine from the Holy Land, and with it
progress and virility. The result of his doings there is
teetotalisra and an intellectual and moral desert. Drink
slays its thousands, no doubt, but it is not the chief sin of
our country. Avarice, lust, dishonesty, ruin more men
spiritually than drink. It is given for use and not abuse.
It goes without saying that it should not be used by
adolescents and youths. Some people are abstainers by
instinct; others wisely abstain when they see they cannot
stop in time. There is again the man whose abstinence is
due to some sad bit of family history, to the injury or
ruin through drink of some near relative. The motive of
the latter is touching and honourable. Let each be fully
persuaded in his own mind ; hut let all be temperate.
Among the painful cacophony of State wails,
the wail of the school-teacher has just now
unusual prominence. Not to put too fine a
point upon it, the school-teacher wants more
screw. There are many admirable reasons why
he (she) should get more screw, and there is
only one why she (he) shouldn’t: the country
can’t afford the money. That reason is, unfor-
tunately, conclusive ; and this is why. The
State school-teacher plays the most important
part in the most important department of State
labour. While most of us are chattering in the
present, he (she) is steadily building up the
future. Neither money nor pains should be
spared to secure her (his) efficiency. Obviously,
at the ordinary market-rate of remuneration for
such things, you cannot expect all the arts and
sciences for £IOO a year. Like every other
employer, to get a good man (or woman), the
State must pay good money. But (1) the State
doesn’t w T ant all the arts and sciences for £IOO
a year ; it only wants a certain specified amount
of learning and capacity, and affirms that this
amount is purchasable at current rates. (2) Many
teachers are paid more than £IOO a year, and
if the avenues to promotion were only kept
open, if aged and incompetent teachers were
removed from well-salaried positions, there
would be far less ground for complaint in the
lower grades. And (3) unfortunately—and this
is a strong point—the supply of the State
school teacher is greater than the demand.
There are more of him (and far more of her)
than the State needs. The calling is not
laborious, the working-days are only five a
week, and the hours are short; there are eight
solid weeks of paid holidays in the school
year ; the position is secure and involves little
anxiety; railway-fares are reduced or abolished,
even if the accommodation is only second-
class. All these things make State school-
teachership sought after, and they must be taken
into account when considering the salary which
they inevitably tend to decrease. The State
cannot disregard them, cannot afford to dis-
regard them. There is a constant pressure on
the Education Department, as on all other
State departments, by young men (and women)
who deliberately prefer the greater ease and
security of the Civil Service to the greater risks
and profits of private business. They cannot
fairly expect to combine State privilege with
private profits. State administration, to be
successful, must look first to the public interest,
and only secondarily to the interest of its ever-
growing class of officials. There remains in
some minds an impression that the State exists
for the benefit of its servants, and not its ser-
vants for the benefit of the State. The sooner
that impression is removed, the better.

One day James Tyson, bachelor and cattle-
king, Australia’s rictiest man, on his way to one
of his out-stations, was caught in a heavy night-
storm and called at a neighbour’s, where he made
himself known, asked to be shown to the bachelors’
quarters—and was made comfortable in the house.
When the hostess asked him why ho had not
visited them sooner, seeing that he lived compara-
tively close, James replied: “Well, you see, I
thought you kept up too much style for me, but I
shall come again, for there’s no style about you.”
The lady, who tells the story herself, still wonders
whether or not the long millionaire intended a
compliment.

The “ Firm’s ” big spectacular drama at
Sydney Lyceum still blazes with unabated splen-
dour down the corridors of Time. There is nothing
especially appropriate about this statement, but
the vastaess of the occasion calls for large and in-
coherent observations. The piece has been com-
pressed somewhat since the opening night; in order
to bring it within a reasonable compass, and,
consequently, the dialogue has suffered a little.
There was exceedingly little dialogue even at the
beginning, and what there was wouldn’t have
been missed, so this abbreviation doesn’t matter
much. Also, the 800 tons or so of scenery goes
smoothly now, and without a hitch. On the
opening night The Bulletin, in an unwonted
spirit of consideration for the vastuess of the
enterprise, forebore to mention that the ship
Henrietta was unmanageable, and threatened more
than once to sink with all hands, and that the
road-agents talked with such needless persistence,
while waiting for the train, as to suggest that the
train had stuck somewhere, and was being shoved
desperately by the whole force of the company.
These troubles, however, have been surmounted.
The axle-box of the wilderness has been greased
to make it go smoothly, and the heaving ocean has
got its second wind, and the primeval forest has
evidently straightened up and sworn off drink.
* • »
As for the company, The Bulletin is in-
clined to the opinion that Miss Polly Emery will
gather more new laurels than anybody else. Miss
Polly is about the best slavey on the Australian
stage, and her wild pursuit of certain domestic
duties under difficulties is a pleasant thing to con-
template. Caicedo, the Columbian, now turns an
extra somersault on the wire, and when his two
rather brief legs and his gleaming spurs and his
shiny top-boots are in the air the public enthu-
siasm is boundless. When he clangs the spurs
together in his atmospheric flight the enthusiasm
is a little more boundless still. A certain lavish
development about the hinder expanse of Caicedo
makes him look a trifle less graceful when he is
upside-down than he does at other times, but he is
always graceful, more or less.
** * *
The early enthusiasm over ‘ ‘ True as
Steel,” at Sydney Majesty’s, has faded somewhat
within the last few days, and that drama will
retire accordingly. The Bulletin, for one, will
regret its departure. The big mill-wheel in par-
ticular was a valuable moral lesson which no Sun-
day-school infant should have missed. It was
round and endless, like eternity. When it started
to grind up George Rignold and the half-drowned
girl in its revolutions it was the very epitome of
Necessity which goes on for ever, and rolls over
every thing in its road, and never looks back to see
if it is a king or a dog that has been squashed.
It was suggestive of the mills of God which grind
slowly, but which grind exceedingly small,
unless the funny man appears at the window
above at the correct moment, and lifts you
off the mill, and leave it to grind away
without you. And the greenness and slimi-
ness of it, and its general crackedness, and
its aspect of old age and decay were evidently
meant to show that even a feeble instrument can
fill a great emergency when the unseen hand of
Providence is shoving it around. The Bulletin
will be sorry to lose that wheel. Also, it has
waited in pained expectancy to see if the steam-
hammer wouldn’t colne down at last on the
beautiful Roberts’ head, but it never came, and
unless it does it by Friday night the chance is
gone. “ The Shamrock and the Rose,” a drama
new to Australia, goes up on Saturday.

“Captain Fritz”is expected to fill Sydney
Criterion on Saturday, and will do its best to
that end. “Fritz” is described as a romantic
musical comedy, and it is an awful fact that the
(•oinantic comedy is generally maudlin, and the
romantic musical comedy is usually a species of
updres,sed farce with wails. If the new produc-
tion is none of these things then it should open
with bright prospects.

The old Royal remains shut, and its future
continues to be uncertain. Sydney, in the present
stage of its progress through a vale of tears, can’t
support four theatres all at once, therefore the
Royal is waiting for some new developments. If
the Cri. is struck by lightning, or the Firm is
fatally gored by a wild gentleman cow, and its
big house shut up, then the ancient establishment
will rise once more to the occasion.

The return of Nellie Stewart to Melb.
Princess’s was celebrated in a fitting manner last
Saturday night. Scaffoldings covered with out
flowers and green stuff found their way to the
stage at critical moments, whereupon the cheers
of the public increased in violence, for nothing
stimulates enthusiasm like an unwieldy floral
tribute. Encores were showered upon the lady
(and truly she deserved them) as a matter of
course. Altogether the occasion vied in splendour
with that first return of Nellie Stewart from Eng-
land, some years since, when, also, she made her
bow as Dorothy Bantam. All other principals in
the cast had changed—Fanny Liddiard, Wood-
field, Knight Aston, Federici, Elton, Alice
Barnett and Ida Osborne were not there—but
Miss Nellie obliterated the lapse of time, so to
speak, and brought the treasured past right up to
date. It was generally conceded on Saturday that
the prima donna’s artificialities of gesture were
less pronounced than when she played at the
Opera House in ’9l, and that her voice was
rounder and sweeter than the one she brought to
bear upon her first “ Dorothy ” performance. So
this third coming of Nellie may be written down
a genuine success. The opera is charmingly
sung all round, and some of the concerted num-
bers go distinctly better than ever. The early
trio between Misses Nellie Stewart, Florence
Voung, and May Pollard, the quartette—“Swear
to be good and true ” —and other familiar items
are heard with fresh interest. Tapley’s opening
solo, terminating with a flight into falsetto, is a
tasteful bit of work. The story of Dorothy seems
very thin and old now, but Lauri’s dancing and
acrobatics as Lurcher don’t leave much Elton to
he desired, and the acting in general is not un-
worthy of the siiiging. “Dorothy” runs six
nights only. “The Mountebanks ”to follow.
** * *
At Melb. Alexandra they had the painful
satisfaction of turning money away from all parts
on Saturday night. There are many windows
adjoining the roof of the oval-shaped edifice, but
the gods having ordained that these windows shall
be closed in winter, they remain shut in summer,
and the recent popularity of the Haleck has its
drawbacks when the weather grows sultry. With
more air let into the proceedings, “After Dark”
will go on and prosper, for it is an intellectual
feast as compared with previous products of
Dan Barry’s season. The original drama has
been more or less pulled about to suit this
occasion, and its strong scenic points stick
out less obtrusively as of yore nevertheless,
the spirit of Dion Boucicault governs the show.
Miss Lilia Wilde is a useful addition to the com-
pany, while Miss Dora Moatyn gets another
chance to show her aptitude for ragged boy parts
and chip in a pleasing ballad. Dan Barry might
roar louder and gnash his teeth more violently as
Old Tom, yet his performance is respectable, like
Appleton’s in the r6le of a black-wigged convict
from Australia. Furthermore, Martyn Hagan, in
the music-hall scene, is a cheerful break in the
clouds of sin and suffering, and the accessories are
all that can be expected, or even more.

Melbourne Royal is to be re-opened on
Saturday by Maggie Moore in her managerial
capacity of Mrs. Williamson, Tempting prices,
from 3s. downwards, are advertised, and bonnets
will receive a welcome to the dress-circle, as in
America, where the taint of vice-regalism does
not infect Democracy. For the sake of this inno-
vation, apart from all other facts, the Maggie
Moore season deserves to prove a huge success.
The Mascotte artist and company will lead off

Funny Fred Garnett is just now appear-
ing at the Alhambra, where things generally are
much the same as usual. The Cycloramas and
Aquariums announce themselves to the world
with increasing confidence since show business
began to improve all round, also the Paltner-Beau-
mont company, just back from a long Maoriland
campaign, will try the effect of a concert at the
Exhibition on Saturday (24th). Last Saturday
the military, 700 strong, gave a warlike display in
this building erected by the taxpayer, and the
bagpipes subsequently made night hideous by
marching down the tram route.

On page 1 of this issue is published the
portrait of the promising Melb. soprano, Miss
Clara Mongredien. Born in Ballarat (Vic.), the
lady, when very young, was taken to Maoriland,
where, at the Dominican Convent, Dunedin, she
received her general education, as well as her first
lessons in singing. From her earliest years she
has always displayed considerable vocal ability.
Miss Mongredien returned to Melbourne five
years ago, and for three years studied singing
under Madame Fanny Simonsen. For nearly
twelve months she has been singing in public, her
first appearance being at the Metropolitan Lieder-
tafel, and very successful. For some time past
Miss Mongredien has been singing principally
at the Melbourne Exhibition concerts.

Much jealousy between the Melb. skirt-dancing schools.

How the papers do rush to put in anything about an
“actrese!" Last week the gobemouches of Australia
were regaled with the doings of a “well-known actress”
over a racehorse. Certainly not one reader in 259 ever
heard of her. All this is very paltry, but it leads one to
reflect how very seldom the real members of the profession
can be laid hold of.
Pianist Bulow, whose death is cabled, was married to
Cosima, the daughter of Abbb Liszt and Countess
d’Agoult. Bulow became charmed with Wagner, and so
did Mrs. Bulow, who had the vagrant blood of her mother,
even as the blood of Maurice de Saxe coursed in the
arteries of Georges Sand. The transference of Cosima
from Bulow to Wagner was cooler than that of Lady
Millais from Ruskin.
Charles Cartwright, agent for “ the Firm ” in London,
has been purchasing plays pretty extensively of late.
Amongst others he has bought the rights of Haddon
Chambers’ new play, which is to be produced by Beerbohm-
Tree. Haddon will be much disappointed if the new play
does not make a hit. He has been commissioned by
Wyndham to write a play for him.
There is strong presumptive evidence that “the Much-
Travelled” is about again, for paragraphs about Mrs.
Besant’s triumphal march through India are commencing
to appear in the London newspapers. The quotations,
marie you, are invariably from “letters home.” She has
submitted her pretty hand—and what a lovely hand she
has!—to a palmist at Kumbackonan—wherever that may
be, Smythe knows, no doubt—and the “Shlokas,” accord-
ing to Mrs. Besant, “gave a very accurate account of her
life, as well as one or two details never printed.” At
Shivas Temple she and her party “ were saluted by the
Temple elephant raising his trunk three times.” Smythe
must buy an elephant. P.S.—The two Smythes— the
Old ’Un and the Young ’Un—have just reached Australia

Forty years ago, he was the most renowned boy-singer in
England. He was attached to Dean Hook’s Leeds
Church, but sang at all big gatherings, even making a
London repute. As a man he had only a thin tenor, and

to England, but came hack gorgeously to Australia, as a
member of the troupe which included Harry Rickards
and Lizzie Watson.

Grattan Riggs once staged “ Handy Andy " in a certain
town. At one point in the play, Andy, supposed to be
dead drunk, has to be carried off by Riggs, after sustaining
a heavy fall. One night, the long and lean Aubrey
Maitland, as Andy, fell heavily across a trap-door with
an iron ring in it. He had slipped his hand under him to
massage the spot, when a funny idea struck him. Passing
his hand through the waistband of his trousers, and grasp-
ing the ring firmly, he awaited developments. On came
Riggs to carry him off, but couldn’t lift him anyhow.
Riggs sought the wings, and said to one of the co.,
“ Would you take that long, lean gossoon to be so heavy ?
I couldn’t lift him! Give me some whisky to put strength
in me.” He got it, and had another try. Still he
couldn’t lift Andy. A second time Grattan sought the
wings. “Couldn’t do it, bedad. But I stirred him.
More whisky, and I’ll do it." He had a second drink,
and went on for a third try. This time Maitland had let
go the ring, so Riggs lifted him with ease. After the
show, in an adjoining bar, Riggs expatiated: “It’s wonder-
ful what strength whisky can put into a man. Look at
me to-night now 1” And he wondered why they smiled.
The chorus-singer applying for a position under Guer-
rera had no show unless his or her vocal attainments went
far beyond the pitch of the usual hack singer, professional
or amateur. Many girls, obliged by the hard times to
work for themselves, essayed to join the chorus, and
emerged from the preliminary test weeping. Unless
their knowledge exceeded the knowledge of the drawing-
room warbler, the conductor would have none of them.
Many of the old stagers who had flourished in the days of
Saurin Lyster and Simonsen broke down under the test.
That is why so many new faces were seen on the stage.
Those who “passed” to Guerrera’s satisfaction were
thorough musicians. Consequence, the chorus was by no
means the weakest part of the show, as it usually is.
The Australasian Dramatic and Musical Association, for
the succour and support of deserving old pros., would
command more respect from the public if it were worthier
of its title. Last year’s subscriptions from members
amounted to £5O. It is true that professionals bought
with their gratuitous services the proceeds’ of benefit
performances in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, but
it is equally true that many people would more gladly
patronise these annual entertainments if the association
were not helplessly dependent upon them. The claim of
the A. D. and M. Asso. upon public sympathy is slight
for the reason that it can’t pretend to be for the benefit
of poor actors and actresses in general, who, as a rule,
don’t belong to it even in the times when they might be
reasonably expected to afford a trifle. Considered as a
trade sick fund, or an anti-starvation guarantee society,
this high-sounding theatrical concern is a tinkling symbol
and a vain thing—more’s the pity.

off him.

The cables respecting the death of a lion-tamer in a

artificial light, is a highly necessary detail towards keep-

tract under its influence; while man is bothered by dark-
ness. The dislike of wild beasts to fire is well-known. In
the ’Frisco tragedy, out went the electric lights ; in-

Off the stage, strong man Sandow, short, gentle,

man of muscle. “Here,” he said one day, “is a trick
my friend, the Emperor of Russia, who is a very powerful
man, once did in my presence.” Then Sandow took a
pack of playing-cards and tore it in half. “ Here,” he
said, “isa trick my friend, the Emperor of Russia, did
not do.” Then he placed two packs together and tore one

Melba’s friend and colleague, Edouard De Reske, is
described as “gorgeous as ever—gigantic in stature,
tremendous in voice, the most triumphant, superb, dash-
ing devil who ever came down to make mischief here
below.”
Melba is described as “in perpetual terror of the
weather of New York. . . . She never ventures out
during the day, on account of the abrupt and violent
changes of temperature, and she dreads the night air as
the average citizen dreads pestilence. The two minutes’
encore at the opera-house make up for all these priva-
tions.”
Haddon Chambers’ “The Honourable Herbert," writes
The Bulletin's London correspondent, may be cited as
a play which the public, for some occult reason, will not
take to. To my mind, it is almost, if not quite, the best
thing Chambers has done, and I feel sure that it would
be well worth trying on an Australian audience. Bad
acting killed it in London.
Dampier sometimes effectively takes to humour. A
certain tragedian had played a season in a Maori-
land city, and, on the last night, announced from
before the curtain that Dampier’g co, would open on
the following evening in the same building. Of
course, he made a patronising speech and clawed
his long hair. “ Ladies and gentlemen, while thanking
you for your kind support, &o. . . . While appearing
as »n artist before the people of New Zealand, I have
invariably been well received, and have dined with lords
and bishops. . . . Let me ask you, then, not only for
his own merits, but for my sake, to extend your warmest
patronage to my old friend, Mr. Dampier-yes, 1 may call
him my old friend—l have known and admired him for 20
years.” And so on. Dampier was in front, and heard it.
The night following the audience was somewhat meagre,
but the tragedian was there, prominent in astage-box. The
veteran Dampier came on, with a wig of gorgeous hair d
la the tragedian, only three times as long and four times
as thick, and straight off gagged a speech into the play.
“My hair, mada.ne, my hair is the admiration of the
world. Actor, madame 1 Do not call me by the plebeian
name of actor (running his hand through his tremendous
hair); lam not an actor, lam an artist! I have dined
with lords and bishops. Why, has not a member of this
very audience publicly stated that he has known and
admired me for nine hundred years—he has, by the way,
only been in the profession for ten years, yet, doubtless,
his remark is true 1” Dampier would, probably, have
gone further, but at this point the tragedian rose up and,
walked out. Then the play proceeded.
Antoinette Sterling’s ear is said to greatly resemble-

The Era says of Richard Mansfield, the American)
alleged actor: “Once in the course of a rehearsal ire
which he considered that certain members of his company

empty benches of the unoccupied auditorium, appealed
to his Maker for patience to endure the unavoidable
aggravations of his calling.” But, after all,, it wasn’t
original. No mummer ever does anything original. Lots-

Mrs. Kendal sends tills dreadful whopper from the

raining cats and dogs. I was in a dreadful dilemma. I
had no goloshes, no umbrella. The coup 6 stood thirty
yards away, and between it and me lay a nasty big mud
puddle. 1 was just on the point of calling to Willie, when
suddenly I noticed that about twenty men in evening
clothes were waiting beside the coup 6 to catch a glimpse
of me as I passed out. As they caught sight of me stand-
ing on the threshold in perplexity, twenty crush-hats
were whisked off with one consent. There was a click like
a diminutive roll of musketry as the hats were shut, and
then, as one man, the well-dressed battalion advanced,
and laid their hats down in the mud, thus forming a series
of stepping-stones, which reached to my carriage-door.”

Last week that unspeakable financier, Treasurer
Carter, of the eternally-muddled Backbone Ministry,
announced that no more 4 per cent, debentures would be
sold in Melbourne under £lOl. A few months ago the
same blessed Govt, gave away a million's worth of bonds
to the British investor at considerably less than £96, and
just now Robert Keid is inspecting the London money-
market—probably to see if another loan can be floated at
a trifle above that figure. Apparently, the Patterson
Government is fond of the British investor—so fond of
him that it would rather take £96 from him than £lOO
from the Vic. capitalist.
Carter’s brilliant move will, of course, choke off
the local capitalist, who is hardly likely to take Vic.
debentures at £lOl when he can get those of N.S.VV. at
£lOO. Then the Backbone Cabinet will have to appeal
once more to J. Bull, and borrow another million nr two
at any price he likes to offer. There is no visible sense or
reason or sanity in Carter's proceeding ; it means loss of
self-reliance, loss of money, loss of prestige, and loss of
any little reputation for intelligence which the wretched
Backbone Cabinet ever possessed. And on the contra
side of the account there is nothing—absolutely nothing.

Last year, for the very first time since 18(59,
N.S. Wales liquidated (he interest on her public and
private debt, not out of borrowed money but out of her
own resources!!! The interest which the afflicted pro-
vince has to pay annually to the British money-lender is
estimated at £4,824,000. When the exports of N.S. Wales
exceed the imports by this amount it is evidence that
the liability has been met; when they don’t, tire interest
is being paid-either wholly or in part-out of more
borrowings from Biitain.
* * «
This is the one test which can’t be “faked.”
In the five years covered by the last Parked Foreign-trade
regime, N.S.W. did not meet one solitary penny of interest
on its public or private debt out of its onn resources—it
was all, to the last coin, paid out of borrowed money.
And the same result has characterised every Foreign-
trade boom for the past quarter of a century. In the last
34 years there have only been nine in w Inch the province
has paid any part, however small, of its interest liabilities
out of revenue, and only four in which it has liquidated
the whole bill. And these rare occasions were mug
ago, when the amount payable in interest vmis very small,
and the curse of foreign capital had not >el settled heavily
upon the land.

cent, on the whole and getting three per cent, on
£1 350,000 and nothing on the balance. This means a

Every 00. in Victoria is more or less in the hands of
one bank or another, and it has only just dawned on those
who have advanced largely on the strength of uncalled
capital, that the professional dummy was a solemn
reality. An advance of over haif-a-million by two insti-
tutions on the uncalled capital of a big brewery will
probably not pan out £lOO,OO0 —thanks to the late

The elasticity of Vic. insolvency law is ap-
parently boundless. Traders threatened with insolvency
have long since jumped their private debts by forming
their businesses into limited liability co.’s (only one out
of 30 has, by the way, been upset), but a late develop-
ment shows that where one trader is heavily involved on
‘‘accommodation paper” with another, the former can,
prior to insolvency, transfer the whole of his hook-debts
(the only free asset) to his friend, and, what’s more, no
one can say “ booh ” to him. Verily is Victoria the land of
promise for the individual who is well read up in the

Some Melb. brokers have been bearing Bayley’s
new shares at 15s. three months ahead. Something is
said about what a man saw who timbered a shaft, but the
writer is told that the underlay shafts are not timbered,
and as the main shaft is of course, sunk away from the
reef it is not easy to see what this rumour has to do with
the question.
« * *
Another version (on Bayley’s own authority) of
Bayley’s sale. When Sylvester Browne first asked Bayley
what he wanted for his Reward Claim, he replied: “ There
isn’t enough money in Australia to buy it.” Then, he
had no idea of selling; later on. he fell ill, and while ill
Ford, his mate, urged him to part. For some time Bayley
stuck out for £lO,OOO and one-fourth share, but finally
agreed to £6OOO and one-sixth. Bayley declares that had
he and Ford been able to leave the mine for a fly-round,
after their many hardships on the field, they would not
have sold at all.
• # •
When Bayley was in Perth offering for sale his
now famous mine, several diggers travelled there from
Coolgardie in the hope of picking up somebody with
money or influence to secure it. Everyone who looked
“ fat ” was besieged as soon as he stepped ashore at Free-
mantle by miners who told him that more gold than the
purchase money could be actually seen on Bayley’s. But
no one listened.
# * •
It is said that 14 days’ additional time was
given Browne to negotiate for Bayley’s, and that had he
liked he could have purchased Bayley’s and Ford’s 4000
original shares at 6s. each—£l4,ooo for an interest now
worth £75,000, and £6OOO for five-sixths of a mine now
worth nearly £500,000, and which, if it continues as rich
for another 100 ft., will be worth over a million.

The lawn-tennis young man should nob rush to
Coolgardie just now. A Bulletin correspondent: “We
reached Coolgardie from Siberia after an awful time.
The bung came out of our water-cask unknown to us, so
we camped without a drop of water for horses or our-
selves, and it was over 110 in the shade, with 30 dry miles
still to go.”
# # •
Another extract: “ I bought for =£lo a 200-
gallon tank yesterday, to take out to our claim eight
miles away ; then we paid £lO for water to fill it. Under
these circumstances, I think the warden should grant us
and others so fixed further exemption.”
tt * *
W.A. mining news is terribly mixed by the
dailies owing to the absence of communication by wire.
Under the heading of “Coolgardie goldfields” we read of
orushings and the scarcity of water at the Marble Bar. It
will be news to a lot of people to hear that Marble Bar is
a goldfield hundreds of miles north of Qeraldton, and
nearly 1000 miles from Coolgardie. Writer met a Marble
Bar miner in Melb. last week. He spoke well of the field
on which there is a 5-head battery kept going in crushing
several-oz. stone.

It is strange to know that the present N.S.W.

Hargreaves, who got the Govt, reward for Australian
gold-discovery, and it may interest the veteran to know
that for years some hundreds of fossiokers have been em-
ployed on the banks and valleys of the Macquarie, where,
as a rule, the gold costs quite as much to get as it is
worth.

For the three months ended December, Oool-
gardie returned 32,3400 z., and Murchison 87650 z. Of
course, Bayley’s hugely accounts for the difference, but
not altogether. The crushing plants now at work will
push Murchison upwards this quarter.

“Ergo’’has published the yields from two or
three mines at Pambula. They amount to over 13000 z.,
and he wants to know why the field is ‘ so shamefully
and persistently run down by a Sydney newspaper.
Pambula has run itself down, and two-thirds of it should
be wound-up. Two or three crushings don t make a
mine, much less a goldfield. “I have not kept the
records of other parts of this field.” “ Ergo has, there-
fore, neglected the easiest part of his duty. His state-
ment that the results of the field cannot be beaten by any
other in N.S.W. is not very wide of the mark, tor, worse
luck, there is not a payable reefing field in the province.

Some men say Murchison (where, as they have
water, they can already turn out gold from crushings) is a

The inventor of a gold-saving machine seeks to
claim the £lOOO reward offered by N.S.W. Mines Depart-
ment for the discovery of a new payable goldfield, but
Govt, says he doesn’t come within the category of eh-

upstanding, whole-souled saver would actually discover 50
new payable goldfields by galvanising the ghosts of the

Some ignorant new - chums out prospecting
dropped across some rich specimens, and, on returning
to camp, showed them and “ blew ” about them, explain-
ing exactly where the pieces had come from. Two or
three sharp people “ took it all in,” and one of these,
feigning illness, disappeared from view-for the purpose
of pegging-out the new-chums’ ground. Later on, the
smartiea accompanied the new-chums to the latter’s
ground, and were, of course, much surprised and rather
indignant to discover that the new arrivals “had been
working on our prospecting area. Why, there’s our pegs.
Don’t you see ’em? Hey!” That is the story told of

Colossal sums have been spent in Barrier sul-

Dr Schnaebel, from Freiburg, at a huge fee, and since
then practically every B.H. mine manager has been

of discarded experimental plants is legion. Shoals ot
private inventors have also been at work. Though special-
class sulphides are made to yield a profit, the real
“ solution of the sulphide problem ” is not yet.
Most of the processes have been either mechani-
cal or chemical. Two Gilbertian students, however, tried
something humorous boiling oil and melted lead.

Marshall Brothers’ Hill End reef is a continuation
of Sftrgeant’s vein, west of and within the township area.
Nearly 40 years ago, when working the matrix for gold
was prohibited, thousands of ounces were obtained 200
yards south of the present find. Fully 500 ft. along the
vein has been exposed, showing splendid specimens. Over
£BOO in value has been taken out, and the picked quartz
would realise over lOOoz. to the ton, while the average
should be over 30oz. to the ton. Professors Taiband
Watson, of Adelaide University, were on the ground
when the find was reported, and themselves knocked out
£3OO worth of specimens in a couple of hours. The result
is the formation of a wealthy S.A. syndicate, headed by
Barr Smith, to work the reef. The specimens have been
compared with Bayley’s and are said to look even better.
The wages difficulty of the Newcastle and Bulli
coal-miners ami of Custom House tide-waiters is, in the

makes from 15s. to 20s. per day, but take the year, and he
makes about £6O; the tide-waiter makes 10s. 6d. per day

Dear Bulletin, —In Tor-

contractor Goddard, uncle to the
Barrier champion, a sturdy little
man with many old-time Syd-
n y reminiscences. Architect
Barnett was originally a stone-
mason in Goddard’s em-
ploy, and got his first
lift when Goddard re-
commended him as a
timekeeper to B aokett,
then building Sydney
University. Over a glass
of ala we discussed the political
genius of Parkes. Goddard re-
membered his first election for
East Sydney, when he was
opposed by Kemp, of the
Herald, a jolly, little, round
man. When Kemp appeared at
the hustings to address the
electors his pants were badly
burst behind. Parkes followed
him, and commenced thus: “You
have heard a speech from my
opponent, in which he has re-
minded you of a great many
fine things. The only thing he
reminds me of is a defective
orange, and the more I look at
him the more defective he ap-
pears.” Hasn’t that the real
Parkesian flavour?—Yours, Aus-
tralian.

T hey bared their breasts and shook their spears,
and charged and bit the earth ;
My children scattered them as the wind the chaff
on the threshing-floor,
For the Lord thy God is the Lard of Hosts, the
Lord is a man of war.
Let the_ altar smoke and the censer swing in the
shrine of the great and good,
But the savour of incense is not so sweet as the
savour of fresh-spilt blood ;
Let the chant be raised by white-robed priests in
the dim cathedral fane,
But the voice of the choir is not so sweet as the
shriek of the dying man ;
There is joy in the pangs of the parting soul whem
the slaughter has been full sore,
ror the Lord is the God of battles, the Lord is ai
man of war.
So, out from the kraal with the carcase! Fling,
out the carrion, fling !
Let the Matabele lions rend the Matabele king !'
Yet lions would scorn such offal—this but a dog
hath been 1
Call hither the vile hyena, summon the bird:
obscene;
Let the unclean vultures gorge their fill of uncleani
flesh and gore,
For the Lord thy God is a vengeful God, the Lordl
is a man of war.

Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and
impurities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic pur-
gative, but operate by perfectly natural means,
by stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.
Beware of the harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. **TSlone are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on the
outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sincerest
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and address of F.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
It is the M.P. with the jimjams who sees
most “strangers in the ’Ouse.”
Premier Patterson’s “ principles ”—free-
tectionist socialindividualism.
The newly-compiled completed N.S.W.
electoral rolls contain 287,013 names.
Anarchist bills, sans imprint, are stuck on
Melb. telegraph poles, and elsewhere.
“ The working class is the only class which
is not a class. It is the nation.’’—Frederic
Harrison.
The S.A. Co. owns lands valued at
.£1,004,438, or more than is owned by 60,000 men
living in S.A.
“Federation” is the “sounding brass,”
“Freetrade” the “tinkling cymbal” of the coming
N.S.W. election cries.
Over 50 per cent, of the Queensland Civil
servants are worse off in ’94 than they were in ’B7.
Many of them as much as 14 per cent, worse.
Seven days before he made him Yic.
Minister of Customs and Education, Patterson
declared Baker to be one of the weakest men in
the House.
Who are the men composing the mys-
terious Junto of the N.S.W. Labour Electoral
League Executive ? And how many of them are
candidates for Parliament ?
Premier Kingston (S.A.) ; —“ My Ministry
has at least two virtues — it does nob contain a
single capitalist, nor does it contain a representa-
b ve of Adelaide Club interests.”
“ A Government weak in its Parlia-
mentary following is often the author of important
r forms because it is obliged to seek for strength
in popular support.”— David Syme.
Eyeglass Reid, M.P. (N.S.W.): “The
Dibbs Government doesn’t know how to die; it
will have to be killed.” Well, Reid doesn’t
know how to do the killing, so—“ Butch-er-r ! ”
There are, in South Australia, 40,277
and tax payers owning .£32,250,000 worth of land.
Only 2192 of these have more than £2OOO worth,
and in the aggregate those 2192 own £21,000,000
worth.
The unusual reticence of the Q. Ministers
during the present recess, at which a Brisbane
paper is so hypocritically surprised, is fully
accounted for by the absence of the Government
in Canada,
N.S.W. Womanhood Suffrage League has
decided to change its name to “Equal Suffrage
League.” And, by the way, let the Labour-party
and its allies go to the country as “ The Demo-
cratic party.”
John Davies, whose vote in N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council turned the scale in favour of pay-
ment of members, will, the first chance he gets, in
whichever House he sits, deliver an emphatic vote
against that measure.
“In China political eminence is reserved
for men who can write elegant verses,” says a
Nineteenth Century writer. The Bulletin
long ago contended that there was a great open-
ing for Parkes in China.
Sixty-one land - tax payers own land
valued at £7,473,472— nearly one-quarter of the
land values of S.A., or just on £1,500,000 more
than the value of the land owned by all the wheat-
farmers in the province.
“Freetrade and cheap goods.” Reapers
and binders, which are landed in Melb., free of
duty, at £27, cost the farmers from £55 to £65.
Because, apologises the importers’ Argus, of the
cost of the bagman’s services.
A prominent S.A. Tory M.L.O. has
“smashed,” but it is kept quiet, as on his resigna-
tion his seat would go to a Democrat. A list of
his principal creditors mostly fellow-Tories —
would explain many things.
It has been estimated that since W. J.
Lyne last accepted the N.S.W. portfolio of Works
he has, in speeches in and out of Parliament, used
the phrase “private enterprise ” enoomiastically,
and with moist mouth, 227,000 times.
Clerical prohibitionists in Sydney and
suburbs propose, in the event of publicans per-
sisting in refusing the use of their balconies to
teetotal candidates for Parliament, to throw open
their churches to the political enemies of Bacchus.
Notice how all the N.S. W. Foreign-trade
candidates tout for an elective Legislative Council.
But they don’t condescend to details ; they forget
to mention that their efective-Upper-House pro-
gramme includes a Property qualification in the
voter.
Last week gave 25 new applicants for ad-
mission to the N.S.W. roll of solicitors. The busi-
ness is, it is wbll known, ludicrously overdone;
but, on the other hand, Grey’s ideal State, in
which every citizen will be a legal expert, is being
evolved.
The N.S.W. drink bill for ’93 was
■£3 6s. 3d. per head, as compared with £3l9s. lOd.
for ’92. The consumption has steadily decreased
since the boom year, ’BB, when it was £4 10s. sd.
Per head. This doesn’t mean more teetotallers—
only less cash.
Many of the elderly gentlemen of N.S.W.
Legislative Gquncil slept peacefully during the
debate on the Mining on Private Lands Bill, only
Waking with a shock whenever the words “ right
°f private property,” or “ vested interests ” pene-
trated their dreams.
A Parliamentary division of 51 to 9, in
which the Premier and three other Cabinet
Ministers are among the nine, is somewhat queer.
Met this is what befel Dibbs when the N.S.W.
Assembly decided that general elections day should
be a public holiday.
Judas Chamberlain’s remedy for all the
troubles which threaten Great Britain is the form-
ation of a party with J. Chamberlain as the head-
stone of the corner. In this he somewhat
resembles H. Parkes, or, for that matter, any
other Australian politician.
E. M. Clark, M.P. (N.S.W.), badgered
the otlrer day about his quixotic Bill for the
extension of flogging, admitted that the Bill owed
its birth partly to his contempt for the opinions of
certain newspapers. Which means that to “rile”
a newspaper he will flog a man.
David Syme in a contemplative mood ;
“There are signs that the personal rule of
sovereigns may yet be necessary to curb the
tendency of popular assemblies to split up into
minute sections, and to waste the time that should
be devoted to national affairs.”
A political genius writing to the Age on
the Education Act, proposes to get over the diffi-
culty with the pietists by a free, religious and
compulsory Sunday-school Education Act. How
nice ! with a lot of “established” parsons and a
pimply, pious Minister for Sunday-schools !
G. D. Prohibition Clark, M.P., got a no-
confidence vote passed against him, the other day,
at a Leichhardt (N.S.W.) meeting. One blas-
phemer yelled out: “Go up, thou baldhead!”
Clark looked around for the 42 she-bears, but they
were away at a Social Gimlet meeting.
N.S.W. Commandant Hutton’s 14-times-a-
-week-repeated argument that the more money
Australia spends on military defence, the more it
will be able to borrow in England, comes simply to
this, that the more Australia borrows from Eng-
land the more she must spend on militarism.
Jabez Balfour, let it be noted, is not
charged with issuing false balance-sheets, but with
“ fraud as director of a public company, and
obtaining money by false pretences.” Yet the
Jabez Balfour companies were worked upon the
same lines as many Australian land-boom institu-
tions, doing a flourishing paper business among
themselves, creating false profits, and disbursing
large dividends which really came from the capital
and deposits. If Jabez be extradited and put
upon his trial in London, a full account of the
proceedings will doubtless interest the Victorian
Crown Law department.
George Opposition Reid,
M.P., says that he has thrice
declined the N.S.W. Attorney-
Generalship—“ the blue riband
of the legal profession.” What
spasm of modesty, or laziness,
saved the country from such
an affliction as Attorney-General
Reid? The mere statement is
a keen illustration of the dan-
gerous stupidity of having the
Attorney-Generalship a political
office. It belongs to the penal
and not to the political order
of things, and should be as per-
manent and non - political a
billet as those of Sheriff Cowper
and Hangman Howard, C.M.G.
(We hope this isn’t a libel.)
How to draft a Parliamen-
tary bill. Take a Govt, steamer
and a special caterer. Have tha
Bill already prepared by a
barrister whom you also invite
—Sunday preferred. Stoke up
well, start your cigars, and, as
you put your thumb down on
each clause, propose a toast
and cry—“ Damn Shecawgo!”
Then send in the bill to tha
Treasury and buy a larger bat.
It would appear that one
of the future troubles of “New
Australia” is to arise out of
the fact that the land is al-
ready largely occupied by Indian
settlers. These settlers, appa-
rently, have no legal title to
the soil; still, they have built
theirhomes there and established
their farms, and the New Aus-
tralians will have to evict them
in the good old Irish fashion
before they can enter into full
possession. In fact, the commu-
nity, where all is to be peace
and plenty and universal brother-
hood, can’t get fairly started
until these unfortunates are
bounced out to take their chance,
with their wives and families,
in the hungry outer world. Par-
aguay, by the way, is reported
to be a place where the public-
houses are open all Sunday, and
where the day of rest is mostly
put in at cock-fighting in the
public-house yard. These cir-
cnmstances don’t promise well for a strictly-
teetotal settlement.
It is averred that the wool-laden teams,
which, of late, have been competing with N.S.W.
railways on the journey to Sydney, are not all run
on their own wheels, as it were, but that subsidies
are paid to at least some of them by interested
persons who wish to discredit the N.S.W. railway
management.
The “business people” of Croydon (Q.)
recently subscribed a purse of sovereigns to
Labour-member Brown towards the £l5O cut off
by Griffith “ to keep an undesirable class of men
out of the House.” Brown, though a bachelor,
has received in all .£l2O from his constituents
since j une last.
The S. A. Govfc. wants the mail-companies
to pay the cost of the blue-lights used for acknow-
ledging the similar signals of the incoming
steamers off Gape Borda. Economy is the alleged
reason for this pettifogging demand. Each blue-
light costs 25., so the weekly retrenchment amounts
yearly to a fiver !
Dear Bulletin, —Who is it that is entitled
to the undying contempt of white men for first in-
troducing Kanakas to Queensland ? I know that
Gilchrist Watt had them on May Downs, 50
miles from St. Lawrence, in 75, when I was there
jaokarooing. Wellshot is said to have been the
first Kanaka home on the Barcoo. Who was the
first “ blackbirder ” ?—Yours, Jeeby,
Lobengula, the deceased Matabele king,
to J. Ball’s Chartered 00. : —“ Land is where my
women plant their corn; land is where my people’s
cattle feed; land is where my young men hunt;
land is the sole livelihood and birthright of my
people. I have no power to cede my people’s land
away to white men.”
The Adelaide unemployed supply an ex-
cellent illustration of the folly which is eagerly
seized upon by opponents to damn the cause of
Labour. They want a private subscription started;
they want church collections ; they want Govt, to
issue free rations. But they won’t crack stones in
return :jfche work is degrading.
A junior N.S.W. barrister, not unknown
in journalism, urged Barton, then Attorney-
General, to advise Gov. Duff to withhold his
assent to the N.S.W. Electoral Act, the junior
contending that the measure demanded a reference
to the Imperial Government. Barton acknow-
ledges, in handsome phrase, that junior’s perspi-
cacity.
The Yic. Public Works Department is
now doing its best to encourage convict-labour on
State contracts, having induced the penal authori-
ties to undercut the prices of legitimate firms who
tender for supplying broken metal— 2Jin. bluestone
broken for Is. 4d. a yard ! The practice of buying
clothing, boots, etc., from Pentridge prison is also
being encouraged amongst Government employes.
The secretary of the sickly Yic. Freetrade
Democratic Association states that its democracy
is confined solely to shrieking for more foreign
goods. “ Whenever, by the abolition of Protection
in all its shapes and forms, freedom of exchange
is gained the association will have done its work,”
says the ingenuous secretary. At which rate the
Crack of Doom will find that syndicate of patriots
still working.
Demos : The strangest thing this week is
Melb. Trades Hall cadging to the Shearers’ Union,
to save its building. Truly, Democracy is beaten
to its knees, fighting with the stump of its sword.

PARSON: “It’s shocking to hear a boy like you, swearing to
himself for mere fun, as you think it.”
BOY (who is temporarily imagining log to he a sulking bullock) :
“I’m not sweatin’ to myself for fun, I’m learning to
drive bullocks. I’m going to drive father’s bullocks

Convention, is pretty well quenched. What’s the
use of illusions ? All the sludge of Trenwith, of
Hancock, of Murphy ?
No matter what may be thought of its
propriety, the pluckiest political action for many
years was the Dibbs Govt’s, retention of Minister
Copeland, in defiance of Mr. and Mrs. Grundy.
Nothing like it has been seen since the time of
Milburn Creek, when gallant old Jack Robertson
stuck to Garrett, while Parkes threw Baker to the
wolves. Not that The Bulletin thinks Baker
deserved anything better.
Why don’t the unemployed women of
Sydney interview the Premier by deputation?
The appearance and re-appearance of unemployed
men only in the capacity of seekers for work is a
mere perpetuation of the old faith that women,
when they suffer, must suffer in silence. Women’s
hearts are being broken daily for want of work,
and they have as much right as the men to be-
labour Government for help.
Dear Bulletin, —You remark on the
absence of “great little men” from Australian
politics. There are plenty of great big men “in
it,” but why? Because broad shoulders and bull-
necks, and York-ham fists, and the bellowing
power of a bison, are the essentials to success in
Australian politics just now. When statesman-
ship and patriotism are wanted again the little
man may show up. lam a small man.—Yours?
Smell.
The S.M. Herald stints its admiration of
the zealots who maintain that only “ Christians ”
should be elected to Parliament. It naively
argues that, were our coinage pure gold, the metal
would melt away in course of circulation, and
that in a similar way Christian men without the
alloy of a few vices would be too soft for legisla-
tive work. People will now clearly understand
why it is that “ Mister James ” has so repeatedly
declined the invitations of Freetrade leagues to
stand for Parliament.
The Earl of Radnor, a recent peer of no
special account, declares that the House of Lords
won’t be abolished except by a gory revolution.
The peers, in fact, are going to wade in blood and
carnage before they let go one of the blessed
privileges of the House which rules because it is
somebody’s eldest son. All the same, when the
time comes, they will knock under unobtrusively.
There is more beer than blood and old tradition in
the Lords nowadays, and beer seldom fights.
Miller, M.P., said the other night that if
there were no N.S.W. Hansard, Parkes and
Dibbs would deny that they made such speeches
as afterwards turned out to be inconvenient to
them. Quite likely; but when Mr. Miller nodded,
“ And so would I,” he suggested the preacher who
quoted St. Paul and nodded, “ My opinion is just
the same.” It is certainly worth while to keep a
Hansard to choke Parkes or Dibbs, but it would
be ruinous waste to keep a five-page primer to
choke a battalion of Millers.
A N.S.W. country bailiff has been made
returning-officer for his electorate. This is a fine
stroke of policy. Hitherto it has been possible to
dodge a local writ; but now in our mind’s eye,
Horatio, do we see the bailiff sitting in his booth
and serving out blue-paper and ballot-papers at
one and the same time. His minions will all be
poll-clerks and assistants, and will catch the un-
wary voter on the hop. Why shouldn’t all the
returning-officers be bailiffs, or all the bailiffs be
returning-officers, and kill two birds with one
stone in the interests of the groaning taxpayer?
Premier Patterson (he has been staying at
Richmond, N.S.W., with Brokenhillionaire Philip
Charley, whose romanticised history was lately
set forth in the daily press) insists blatantly that
the fears about the horrors of winter to the unem-
ployed are groundless. “As a matter of fact,” he
says, “ there is no winter in this country.” It is
a great pity that Patterson cannot be given six
months on the doss without the option of a fine.
Considering the heat of the Melb. summer, a
Melb. winter is a cruel ordeal to the unsheltered.
A new paper, called the Orangeman, is
shortly to be started in Sydney. Its mission is to
boom the memory of Dutch William and the
siege of ’Derry, and incidentally to give a helping
hand to Freetrade, on the good old assumption
that God is on the side of imported calico. The
Cardinal, by the way, is a Freetrader, but as the
Neild crowd doesn’t allow any Catholic to be a
Freetrader he will probably be blasted with the
rest of the Protectionist party. The Orangeman
is to be run by a Hebrew gentleman, on the
“How these Christians love one another” prin-
ciple.
The old English law forbidding the settle-
ment of Jesuits within British territory has never
been repealed in N.S.W. Therefore, if J. Cash
Neild, M.P., likes to rise like one strong Orange-
man in his fury, and take the requisite legal
proceedings, he can hunt away every Jesuit, and
run the emissaries of Rome into the South Sea.
His neglect of this great work makes The Bul-
letin half inclined to suspect that Jawbone is
not a true Orangeman, after all. In fact, this
paper doesn’t feel at all certain that he isn’t a
Popish emissary in disguise.
A member of Melb. Trades Hall council
lately drew attention to the alarming local
increase of Chinese laundries (there are no
Chinese laundries in Sydney—why ?) and said
that the working class were their best customers.
This is one of the awkward facts which persist in
cropping up to show that the working man is no
more of an angel than anybody else. It is generally
the’wife who is to blame, however. “ The practi-
cal animal ” will always prefer a Chinese to a
European cabbage if she can get it for a farthing
less, and often when the price is the same, “John
is so civil!” As a preparation for female suffrage,
working men might try to educate their wives and
daughters in the knowledge that these small
economies won’t work with the great principles
which mean, not economy only, but existence for
them all.

Tin Fr'aposoa Vi,sic of tha Governor.
A public meeting was liel.t in the Council
Chambers last Friday evening for the purpose
of.fully discussing and deciding the question-
of inviting the Governor to visit Bingara on
an eaily date.
About 30 persons were in at tendance t and
the Mayor was votedje the cliajr.
A' long and somewhat lieated discussion
then took place as to whether Governor the
was invited here in the interests of the dis-
trict or whether ha was simply being made a
stalking-horse for political purposes by Mr.
Dowel ; as to how he should be entertained
if he did come ; and as to whether Lady Duff
should Ire invited to accompany His Excel-
lency on the tour or not.
Mr. T. Connolly thought the present time
moat inopportune to invite His Excellency to
the district. We have practically nothing to
show him, while owing to so much Onangial
distress prevailing we could ill afford the
money which would bg required to entertain
ium in a. fitting manner.
The chairman thought that MPT Dowel's
name had dean brought into this matter vert
unfairly. Regarding the statement of om
of the gentlemen who had spoken to the ef
feet that the money spent on enterlainin;
the Governor might better be used in assist
deg the poor, he might say that so far us he
(the chairman) was personally concerned, he
was always prepared to give his share towards
charily— but he was also prepared at any
lime to give a guinea toward* advertising
‘-heplace.
u Mr. John Byrhes moved, —“That tins
mealing is of opinion that an invitation
should he extended to 'His Excellency the
Governor te-visit" Bingara at an early date.”
Mr. Rogerson seconded the resolution, which
was carried unanimously.
It was also decided that Lady Duff’s name
JjeJiicltided in the invitation.

PREMIER PATTERSON—UNDER ALTERED CONDITIONS.
"There is no use in fifty premiers preachiug to the helpless unemployed multitude the doctrine of ‘self reliance,’ and reminding them of the wonders which a
man could perform 30 years ago, with only sixpence in his pocket, when he earned his swag and billy, and broiled his steak at a roadside fire on the point of a stick.
All the conditions of those times have passed away. The soil, which is the matrix of industry, was not monopolised. Labour was then everywhere in request,
Now it is a drug in the market. If Mr. Patterson were to stand to-day on the city pavement, an unknown stranger, with only sixpence in his pocket and self-reliance
in his bosom, he would run a great risk of having to walk the streets for want of a bed, and with the certainty of looking to the street tap for his breakfast and morn-
ing ablutions."-MELB. AGE.

Sydney Evening News states that Queen
Victoria wears white stockings and elastic-side
boots. There is presumably no legal remedy for
this outrage, but if Victoria were to start out one
of her Hindoo servants to kill Henniker Heaton,
who is the Evening News’ near relative, the
great soul of the country would be with her. The
newspaper proprietary which accuses any lady of
wearing white stockings and elastic boots should
be outlawed.

Dear Bulletin, —A contributor praises
the Austral Salon for being quite able to manage
its money affairs, and in spite of the prevailing
depression, having ,£257 to the good. The ex-
planation is simple. Beyond the rent, it had
hardly any other calls on its bank account, for,
whenever the Salon wanted anything, some mem-
ber of the committee would start a fund, and go
round with the hat, into which the women would
drop church-silver, but every unfortunate male
associate was asked to contribute gold. At least,
that was my experience several times. This also
explains why there was, in the early days of the
Salon, such a diligent canvass after male-associates.
When the Austral Salon is on the warpath, Ah
Sin is not “in it.’’—Yours, &c., Ex.-Male-
Associate.

The odd circumstance connected with the
irregularities of the latest levanting Vic. Civil
servant, is that he was not “greatly respected by
all who knew him.” He comes under the news-
paper description of “highly popular,” which
means that he rampaged at hotel-bars, and made
himself favourably known to reporters by his
eternal thirst. An appalling statement that he
was “the very last man who would have been
suspected of any irregularity,” will set a lot of
people wondering where they ought to look for the
first man entitled to such suspicion.

A particularly catchy advertisement—in a
leading Australian daily—for a governess attracted
over 200 applications, from “ society girls ’’ mostly,
who are now only too anxious to turn their hands
to anything. The lady, chosen by personal inter-
view—a young and pretty girl—has ordered, by
direction, several new frocks, and is to proceed,
via a popular health resort, to the scene of her
labours accompanied by her employer, whose wife
and family happen just now to be away in
England. #

If there is one point
on which Maoriland law
is more strict than an-
other it is that the wit-
ness at an inquest must
* 1 see the body. ” The sta-
tute; of the province are
built to fall like a billion
bricks on the witness who
doesn’t make a sufficient
inspection of the “body.”
At a recent Auckland
inquest, held upon some
disfigured and almost un-
recognisable remains, the
wiiow of the deceased
was taken to view the
body according to law.
She fainted at the door
of the morgue, and a com-
passionate constable com-
promised with the law by
carrying her in and out
again. Then the defunct
was removed for burial.
But at the inquest it
transpired that the widow
hadn’t “seen the body”
as provided by law, so a
constable ran after the
cadaver and brought it
back, and the coffin was
unscrewed, and the wit-
ness, in a partially in-
sensible state, was as-
sisted out and “saw the
body.” Then the con-
stable announced that the
body had been duly seen,
and the law was satisfied.
Antoinette Sterling was lionised one day
by tbe Austral Salon, Melbourne. Asked to speak,
she mounted the platform, and requested the one
man present (he was quite tame and had been
handing around tea) to withdraw. This request
he ignored by backing against the wall and staring
stonily into space. “Well, I warn you,” said
Antoinette, “that I’m going to say some very
unpleasant things.” Then she launched out for
two hours against all the vices of humanity, finish-
ing up by a burst of universal brotherhood. “I
love everybody,” she exclaimed; “I love all
women, I love all men—yes, I even love all
reporters.” At the close of her oration she swept
her way to the door, kissing to right and left;
in front of the solitary male she paused, and,
murmuring “Is he not a man and a brother?’’
seized the astonished and now blushing youth
round the neck, firmly pressing her lips upon his
manly brow. Then that youth darted downstairs
in search of the nearest bar.

If the W.C.T.U. saints were better up in
classical history they would not probably have
chosen saffron-coloured window-curtains for their
new premises in Flinders-st., Melb. It may lead
to awkward mistakes in that locality. The tout
ensemble can only be perfected by green shutters
and occasional glimpses of pink-robed ladies
with straw-coloured hair.
By the way, the W.C.T.U. ladies have
celebrated the opening of their new abode by
attacking the enemy in the form of the ice-cream
man. This vessel of wrath lies in wait for Sunday-
school children on their way to school, and
intercepts the missionary-box pennies. Horrified
at seeing the collection and the ice-cream melt
away simultaneously, the ladies interviewed Col-
lingwood City Council, which hit back and talked
quite straight about the religion of a society
that strains at the gnat in Sunday penny ices,
and swallows the camel in encouraging the free
discussion of the most revolting subjects by women
before mixed audiences, including young children.

The son of a Northern squatter, who has
been South for holidays, offered his hand and
fortune to a Sydney girl, lately, and was condi-

girl asserting that she “ wanted to keep out of
anything like Carcoar business.”

The figment under which Australian
Governors are Imperial commanders-in-chief,
enables their military aides-de-camp to set down

brother and Gov. Duff’s aide, obtained promotion
to a majorship, the other day.

Editor Bulletin, — The development of
canine rabies in the hitherto exempt Gape Colony
has an unbounding interest for this cur-cursed
community. Of Sydney’s 20,000 dogs or so, not
half contribute to the revenue, and not one-
twentieth are of any use except circulate
hydatids and render the brain-worker’s night a
hell. In my street, of 41 houses, there are 33
dogs—all curs, all vociferous, and not a few
vicious. On account of the hydatid horror alone
the dog-tax should long ago have been increased
ten-fold.—Growl.

An inhuman story is told of the wife of a
British M.P. who lately flew into a rage when her
husband informed her that he was to be put down
for a baronetcy on the New Year’s list of baubles,
The lady’s indignation was such that the culprit
tottered off to Gladstone, or the person who super-
intends these little matters, and begged to have
his claim to distinction scratched off the paper.
Tothe ordinary woman of Australian “society” this
yarn must sound incredible. The craving for ft
title is born in her, like a secret passion for
diamonds and a thinly-disguised admiration for
curly-haired young men. In the absence of further
particulars as to this mysterious rejection of a
baronetcy out of deference for the wife’s feelings
one can only suppose that the wife was a courtesy
“Lady” already—the daughter of a peer. In
that case, of course, she would prefer the idea of
“Mr. and Lady Clarissa Jones” to the idea of
“ Sir John Jones, Bart., and Lady Jones.” The

The Chicago contingent from Sydney, says
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, are fast
arriving in London, The little Doctor is here,
and Bruce, Terry, and Lew Sampson are on
hand. Several of the staff are going to ’Frisco,
where there is some kind of exhibition on. Terry
has some design in connection with the Antwerp
show. It is strange how men, once they become
connected with exhibitions, can never quite turn
to anything else. It is like journalism, gold-
mining, or the African exploration fever. Once
bitten by it, you can never settle down again to
steady work. # #
Editor Bulletin, —When women’s suffrage

The next council-clerk of Burwood, Syd-
ney —the last one, who was also engineer and over-
seer of works, after fatally shooting the Mayor,
Vdew out his brains last week, should be a
cast-iron man, like “Banjo’s” “Canvasser.’
Aldermen are a quarrelsome lot, but for hot-headed
bickering Burwood heads the list. The meetings
pass off quietly enough, but it has not been un-
common for one mad alderman to be seen hunting
round for another alderman’s gore. No wonder
that Redfearn went looking for blood as well;
nobody expected more from his threats than
another exhilarating scuffle at the outside.
Is it a fact, as stated, that distressed Burwood
residents have had their little “ sticks ” sold up re
trivial sums owing for rates, while aldermen were
allowed to remain unsued for large amounts ?
Privileges of this kind appear to be too often
aldermanic perquisites.
A recent European scandal has enabled the

When an amorous princess elopes with a mashing

persons, male and female, “jump over the broom-
stick,” it is a vile illustration of the vicious
instincts of the lower orders.—

A poor man’s mistress, they call a .

The missionaries of the Batavia River
have scored this time. Had the Kanahooka sur-
vivors landed there some few years ago, they
would probably have been made cold meat of very
quickly. Altogether, they may consider they
have had a marvellous escape. Had they drifted
into the centre of the Gulf, their chance of being
picked up would have been small indeed, for there
it is a sea without a sail. The mail-steamers cross
the mouth from point to point. The Norrnanton
boats keep up to the western side, and the occa-
sional boat to the Roper and Maoarthur keeps to
the east. There is nothing to take a craft in to
the centre of the Gulf. It is, perhaps, for its
locality, the most lonely patch of sea in the world.

An up-country functionary who, with two
companions, visited Sydney within the last two
years to interview Minister Lyne regarding local
requirements, got suddenly lost from his hotel.
Three days afterwards he reappeared, and alleged
that he had passed the interval as a guest of the
Minister. His brother functionaries have, how-
ever, since worked up dates and incidents which
make it appear that their chief, under art assumed
name, had “done time’* in Sydney gaol

Minister LynC to refute the charge. Lyne.iS a

Within the last
three years about 100
murdered infants have

which have not been
found may amount to
another hundred, or,
it may be, to another
thousand. Among
all the multifarious
assassins Francis
Knorr was the only
one discovered. Her
death is a solemn
evidence that in-
fanticide is a safe
pursuit if the infant
is only buried deep
enough, but that
murder will out when
the baby-farmerleaves
the dead offspring in
her own backyard,
with only six inches
of soil above its re-

voice cries out from
the grave to bid the
baby - farmer go and

At a morgue inquest at South Sydney,
on a Chinaman’s wife who had hanged herself,

before the coroner. It was the cord wherewith
the deed had been done.

“Sappho Smith ” in last week’s issue, concerning
the man who got an eloquent friend to write his
love-letters for him, reminds me of another tale I

soul—if he had a soul. He loved his employer’s
A SUMMER NOCTURNE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Night gave to thee thy shadowy hair,
The star-shine brightens in thine eyes,
The languid sweetness of the dusk
Pervades thy low replies.
The mystery of summer night
Is in thy lightest action shown,
Hinting of sweet and subtile things
Known but to thee alone.
Thine arms are as a wished-for rest
Coming when day is done,
To lie at peace upon thy breast
Is shadow after sun.

Warren (N.S.W.) Herald re-opens the
death-adder-sting-tail controversy, despite “Billee
Grant’s ” yarn in a recent Bum etin. One Arthur
Murphy is alleged to have chased a death-adder
at Warren, and, when fairly cornered, the reptile
deliberately committed suicide by stinging itself
with the disputed tail fang. Three or four spec-
tators witnessed this “ rash act,” and a post-

the body “stung” was really punctured and sur-
rounded by a green-coloured circle.

daughter in his own strictly business fashion, and
the old man consented, chiefly because he valued
the bag-youth’s capabilities as a salesman. The
girl also consented, reluctantly. She saw her
bagman seldom during their engagement, because
he was always away pushing the softgoods inter-
est, but he wrote her beautiful, poetic, soulful
letters. And at last she came to love him by reason
of these letters, and decided that it was only a
natural shyness while in her company that made
him conceal his lofty character beneath a hoarse
voice and a perpetual flow of disconnected conver-
sation concerning calico. Then they were married
and presently she found that she had wedded a
bagman pure and simple. The letters had been
written by the other fellow, and the man was
only a plain, unvarnished, red-faced drummer of
the most prosaic description. That was some
fourteen years ago, and all that fourteen years
the bag-husband has come home regularly from
his warehouse, and made a brief remark or two
about the state of trade, and then eaten a large

„ Wellington (M.L.) City Council, the other
day, struck the worst snag in its record. Said
Council has strong moral views concerning the
“ social evil,” and its members are mostly solid on
matters relating to the “age of consent.” But
when a councillor named Petherick rose up and
read out a list of all the eminently respectable
and pious property-holders in the city, whose
houses were let to persons of bad character at
about twice the rental which would be paid by
any person of even moderately good character,
there was a silence which could have been heard
at a distance of many miles. The Council refused
to discuss the matter, and the papers avoided all
mention of the horrible incident. Even the most
aggravated social purist draws the line when it
becomes a question of disturbing the respectable
property-holder.

with detectives, and
maintains that if a poll
of Sydney constabulary
be taken the majority
will favour batons —not
necessarily thebatons now
in use but a weapon
which falls short of chal-
lenging an antagonist to
murder. “ Why don’t
you,” asked the present
scribe, perambulating a
lane in Woolloomooloo at

ver?” “ Not for my life,”

Missus Jackson now?”
BASHFUL BRIDE: “Yes.”
MARY: “Oh, me Missus Jackson once !” —(Conversation ends here.)
Natural enough for three men to repudiate
the paternity of one infant (indeed, it’s 100 to 2on
two doing so), but when three men claim paternity
of one child matters get mixed, especially as there
is only one mother. A case arose in Blackburn
(Lancashire) two months ago where an unmarried
mother left <£2ooo to the father of her child. The
will omitted his name, hence a big law-suit. When
it comes on for hearing the Court ought to be
crowded out.

A TEMPERANCE ADDRESS.
I have no rhyme to spin this week,
No verses can I make ;
The brain, and not the will, is weak ;
My head begins to ache
With every fresh attempt to find
A subject for a song—
And since the Muse is so unkind
1 know my liver’s wrong.
In vain I woo the gentle maid
With soft, appealing sighs.
I’ve pains beneath the shoulder-blade,
And bilious-looking eyes.
The Muse’s heart was not so hard
In days when I was young—
But, ah ! she spurns the hairless bard
With fur upon his tongue.
I mind the time when I could tie
A towel round my head,
And sit me down and versify
Whilst Wisdom lay a-bed.
But now the awful “glass that cheers "
Puts fancies all to rout.
I’m growing old —excuse these tears —
And sin has found me out.
Strong Drink, he is a crafty foe,
Whose guile we never gauge
Until our teeth begin to show
The signs of middle age.
Then manufacturers of verse,
With Wilfrid Denver, say—
“ O, God ! put back Thy universe
And give us yesterday.”
Dear faithful friend, repent in time —
Nay, do not gaily scoff ;
I cannot write a topic rhyme
Because my liver’s “ off.”
I had three “ goes ” of liquid flame
Which wasn’t much ; heigho !
Poor sober Now must bear the blame
For careless Long Ago.
E.F.
Alike is human nature frail,
Or be it female, bo it male.
There’s “Mona’s ” “wanted ” must be old,
Besides possessing storaged gold—
She wants to wed a played-out shape,
And dreams how she would look in crape.
The advertising male above
Hath knowledge how the sexes love ;
Before he mentions trading, mark !
He tells them he is tall and dark ;
And tall and dark men aye declare
Their hearts are fired by maids who’re fair ;
And so he runs the vogue, but, zounds !
His own reserve’s <£1000!

“The Hooligan” (Zeehan): We don’t sympathise with

(Sydney): The E.S. and A. Bank’s debenture scheme is
as good as any other, and is a lot better than the ghastly

“Italia” : Sorry, hut if you want to call wildly on your
lost best girl to come hack, you must do it in the adver-
tising columns. Tun Bulletin pays for all accepted
literary matter, and it isn’t going to pay you for crying
after your own girl “ Waihoa ” (Gis.): (1) Your copy
was condensed somewhat so that you shouldn’t sprawl
all over the paper. Also, the signature was the best shot
we could make at a badly-written autograph. (2) Don’t
remember the yarn “ X.P.” (Burvvood): Judging by
8 pp. of closely-written cursing, you seem to object to
something * Rimu ” (Blackball, M.L.): You complain
because “ men write for money, not for fame.” Well,
supposing you are a bootmaker—which seems a very pro-
bable assumption—do you make hoots for money or for
fame ?....“ lioni Soit, &c.” (Silverton): Will boil down.
W e want Liebig’s extract of joke ; not the original bullock.
“ D. M‘Rae” (Wagga); Lane was “a 'looted ” by the New
Australians, hut he was “appointed” by the Paraguayan
Government, and as a Paraguayan official the State is
bound to support him against the crowd if necessary.
Tney can't shift him by popular vote any more than they
can shift the President. Therefore, there is no more
political liberty in New Australia than in Brisbane. . .
“ J.Mc.” (Camperdownj: All right. The editor w ill he
in on Ist March, 1961, and you can see him then for two
minutes exactly. A preliminary deposit of £6O is re-
quired “ Boz.” : You want an “unbiassed opinion.”
Well, you can’t write, and it is unlikely you ever will.
You want grammar, originality, power of composition,
general education, knowledge of the world, everylhing.
....“ B. Bjornsen ”: Will do when boiled down... “ Ronni ”:
(1) If the “ average death-rate of humanity ” were 14 per
1000 then the average length of life would lie nearly TO 1
years, which is bosh. (2) A life office doesn't always
charge £4O for a £lOOO insurance or anything like it. (3>
In a first class mutual life office, if you insure “ witli pro-
fits, ” you neoer pay more in premiums than the insurance
amounts to. (4) The “chances of his being unable to
continue his payments” are not “ in favour of the office.”
It would take too long to explain this, I ut it is a fact
none the less. (5) Claims are very seldom disputed. (6)
There are no “1001 conditions in (lie contract’’—there
are mostly about half-a-dozen. Why don’t you study
your subject before writing? “J.W.” (Condobolin):
Thanks .. “ Gyp ’’ ; You forgot to put in the tale when
writing your story.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY !
WHA.T IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpenoe, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

“GOOD AD VICE AND A WOODEN DEG.”
If I hadn’t given my friend Jim Smalley the
best piece of advice one young fellow could give
another we should be friends still—that is, if Jim
could have lived without the advice. This may
sound rather strange and mixed to you, but it’s all
right when you take it by the handle.
You see it was this way. Jim was a handsome
chap, 25 years old, foppish and dressy, fond of
society, had plenty of money, but with the seeds
of consumption in him. Got ’em from his mother,
who died of it.
Well, Jim began to cough, and run down hill
fast. The doctors couldn’t help him, and told him
so. One day he was talking to me about it, and
actually broke down and cried. “Jim,” says I,
“ there’s just one chance for you, and I want you
to jump for it right away. That’s to go out West
in America and live on the slopes of the Rocky
Mountains, in the pine woods, in a tent or a hut,
and stay there till you are dead or well. Don’t
write to me for a year, then come back or let me
hear from you.”
Bidding a sad farewell to the young girl he was
engaged to be married to, Jim went.
Two years afterwards I met him in town ; he
was as hearty as a buck, bub walked with a limp.
He had lost his right leg, below the knee, in a fight
with a grizzly bear, and now hobbled around on a
wooden one. “And it’s all your fault,” he said,
“If it hadn’t been for your advice I’d never gone
there. Now Edith won’t marry me. Says she
don’t want a husband with a wooden leg, and I
don’t want a friend who gave me the wooden leg.”
Well, there ! I was never so taken aback. My
advice had saved Jim’s life and restored his health,
yet because he couldn’t have two sound legs and a
wife besides, he threw me overboard. I vowed I’d
never give anybody a bit of good advice again.
I’d let ’em die first. But that’s where I was
wrong. It is a man’s duty to keep on doing
good, whether people are grateful or not. Here is
Mr. Frank Stanley Langman. His wife gave him
a piece of good advice, and he was sensible enough
to act on it. In June, 1882, it was that he fell ill.
He felt weak, tired and weary without any outside
reason for it. His appetite was poor, there was a
bitter taste in his mouth, and a bad pain in the
chest and stomach after eating. Sometimes he
would break out into a sweat and feel so pros-
trated he’d have to lie down. It was feared he
had some kind of internal tumour. Once he had
an attack at the railway station, and people
crowded round him, thinking he was dying.
During another attack he kissed his child, be-
lieving his time had come. A doctor examined
him for heart disease, but couldn’t find any. He
ad vised Langman to take only milk and brandy,
milk and water, and such slops. Still he had
those frightful periodic attacks. After attending
him some time, the doctor said, “ I can’t find out
what is the matter with you ; you had better see a
West End physician.” Mr. Langman did so, and
the West End doctor said the patient’s liver made
too much bile, and ordered medicine and a milk
diet.
Two more doctors were consulted with no better
result, and the unhappy man remained in that
same miserable form for seven years. In Feb-
ruary, 1889, he read in a newspaper of a case like
his own having been cured by Mother Seigel’a
Curative Syrup, but, inasmuch as the best medical
advice in London was of no use, what could be
expected from an advertised medicine? “Noth-
ing, of course,” said Mr. Langman.
His wife thought differently. “ Fom try Seigel’s
Syrup,” she said, “ Everybody speaks well of it.”
He did try it, and in three months he was well,
and has been well ever since. In a letter dated
December 17, 1891, he says, “ Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup saved my life,’’ and signs his
name to what he says—“ Frank Stanley Lang-
man, 44, Comberford Road, Brockley.”
His malady was not heart disease or tumors,
but indigestion and dyspepsia, the cause of almost
all pangs and pains, call them what you will.
Mr. Langman was saved by good advice and a
good medicine, for which he is grateful. So I
take notice that everybody isn’t like Jim Smalley,
witii his grizzly bear and his wooden leg.”

“Have you anything to say before we
eat you?” said the King of the Cannibal Isles to
a Boston missionary. “I have,” was the reply ;
“I want to talk to you awhile on the advantages

Newcastle (N.S.W.) School of Arts decides
by 37 votes to 34 not to open the reading-room on
Sundays. The parsons fought tooth and nail
against the change. But they can’t fight against
the future. Time is on the side of the 34.
Bendigo hospital now supplies Bendigo-
manufactured brandy to its patients. Good. And
the British Army medical authorities have decided
to use Victorian brandy in military hospitals. The
triumphant hour of Australian wines becomes
more visible every day.
Tasmania has an Art Society, and the Art
Society has had an exhibition, and the exhibition
was opened by Gov. Gormanston, and Gov. Gor-
manston has said that Tasmania is making great
artistic strides, and on the subject of strides Gov.
Gormanston is an authority, seeing his own
measures 48 inches. On the subject of art his
dictum is questioned ; and one critic, Montague
Rhys-Jones, erstwhile of Sydney, goes so far as to
say that Tasmanian art consists almost entirely of
hideous daubs. This latter pronouncement has
caused a terrific sensation locally. Everybody in
Tasmania has a hobby. Many people hunt what
the Yankees call “bugs,” including snakes for
bottling purposes; and nearly everyone is a
musician and an artist. The life of Montague
Rhys-. Tones is therefore quite unsafe in Hobart,
and he had better take to the Lake country.
Of 28,294 women on the roll in the chief
cities (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and
Dunedin) at the Maoriland Parliamentary general
election, 23,724 voted ! In New Plymouth, 1289
women voted out of 1465 enrolled, and in Wan-
ganui 1454 out of 1660; Wellington suburbs, 1622
out of 1860. And so it was all round. “Do
women want the franchise ? ” It seems so.
The story of Cyril Haviland, ex-secretary
of Sydney School of Arts, just sentenced to four
years’ gaol for embezzlement, is that of a man who
went to wreck through too much enthusiasm,
Haviland, who was, originally at least, a well-
meaning fellow, lived in a constant state of
enthusiasm. He had a first-class position in the
N.S.W. Civil Service —but threw it up to pursue
spooks and ghosts and elementary spirits and
materialisations of the dead, and other clammy
visitants from over the border. He had a hand-
some fortune, and he spent most of it in publish-
ing alleged poetry of his own and literature which
nobody read, and scattered the rest on the red-
nosed “medium ” who breathes a fragrance of gin
and puts one in communication with the unsub-
stantial wraith of his grandmother. When he
became attached to the School of Arts he started
out with the same deranged enthusiasm as before.
He worked day and night with all his heart and
soul, got women’s subscriptions reduced, filled the
mouldering institution with new subscribers, tore
things to pieces and built them up again, and pub-
lished a paper which nobody read to advertise the
place and make it boom more than ever. The one
thing he could not do was to make the hall a
source of revenue, and, with his usual enthu-
siasm, he secretly took it (or a share in
it) himself at a rental which was a good
deal more than twice the amount of his
salary. Then, with this white elephant on his
hands, he stole the funds of the institution to run
or help run the show with. Also, a vegetarian-
restaurant fad of his seems to have run away with
some of his employers’ money. Most of his steal-
ings seem to have gone in loose, mad enthusiasms
of one kind and another. His fate is a proof that
some kind of asylum is badly wanted for men
with twitching nerves and jumpy muscles, who
have a far away look in their eyes, and talk aloud
to themselves as they hop unevenly along the
street, and stop suddenly in the midst of a con-
versation to listen to the voices of the dead.
Since tobacco was first introduced inEurope,
at least in England, about 300 years ago, its
progress has been incessant, like that of coffee and
tea. Up to the last century a pipe was a luxury
reserved only for the so-called “better classes,” as
it was so dear that for half-a-crown people only got
in tobacco the weight of that coin in silver.
Times have undoubtedly changed for the better in
this respect, since in our days any tobacconist will
give you a packet of Frossard’s Swiss Cigars for a
similar piece of money.
Biggest alligators in the world live in the
Johnstone River (N.Q.). They are to other alli-
gators what bulldogs are to fleas, and when they
yawn a gale of wind levels half the sugar-cane on
the neighbouring plantations. They are very
exclusive-cut even the Chinamen dead when they
meet ’em. Their robust health has a queer
source. A few years ago a plantation punt was
being taken up the Johnstone when it capsized,
and punt, cargo, and Kanakas disappeared.
Before that the alligators had been no better than
those anywhere else, but they began to grow big
and strong from that day. The punt was loaded
with Parsons’ Flaked Oatmeal.
The N.S.W. Fresh Food and Ice Company
has made special preparations for the Lenten
season, and its stock of fish will be unusually
large and choice. All the best Australian and
Maoriland fish are stocked, and a shipment of fine
English fish will arrive by R.M.S. Ophir on 23rd
Feb. The unequalled facilities which this com-
pany has for freezing and preserving fish, game,
&c., ensure that quality remains always first-class,
and orders from country townships or the neigh-
bouring provinces can be promptly filled at the
lowest rates. Milk (now reduced to 3d. per
quart), butter, and all dairy products are also sup-
plied by the N.S.W. Fresh Food and Ice Co.
Premier Dibbs and the Parsons.
Despite his frequent intermittent, public,
bizarre applications of texts of holy writ, when
endeavouring to confound his enemies, N.S.W.
Premier Dibbs must possess a big share of sar-
donic humour. With what infantile assumption
he played last week’s deputation of parsons, and
what a graceless and extraordinary sinner those
neuter-genders must have thought him ! To the
mind tha,t can picture the scene, the whole affair
is a shriek of well-controlled humbug. “We
represent the Council of the Churches.” “ What
is this Council of the Churches ?” Then, with the
oily impressiveness of the saints whose foot-
steps make the foundations of Sheol quiver, it
was told Dibbs that the Council of the
Churches represented “ the six largest Protes-
tant denominations of the province—Anglicans,
Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Congregationalists,
Baptists, and Primitive Methodists.” Dibbs
never turned _a hair. The parsons wanted the
Sunday aquariums and the Tivoli closed up on
Sundays, but could only “get in with their left”
by saying that those institutions made charges.
“Where is this Tivoli ?” asked Dibbs, with new-
chum curiosity. The chief deputationist didn’t
know, but several others did. “Which of you
was there last ?” was the Premier’s next innocent,
baby-like query. “Oh, we don’t go to such
places! The entertainments are secular.” “What
do you_ call secular ?’’ cried Dibbs, with the no-
savee air of a Chinaman.
Parson Walker: They are by no means sacred in any
form. They are comic. And we have evidence that they
sing parodies of sacred songs.
Dibhs: Have you been able to draw the line between
secular and sacred music? I have made several attempts
and failed.
Some further conversation and Dibbs blurted:
—“The paying seems to be the crux of the
business and screwed out of the cleric that the
parsons had no objection to let these secular show's
take up collections and depend on them.
Dibbs: You all take up a collection yourselves. You
send the hat round, every one of you. If you had to
depend on a collection, you would have to close, too.
Walker; Oh, no, we shouldn’t. We are satisfied to
depend on a collection.
In his enthusiasm for the cause, Parson Walker
evidently forgot momentarily that he enjoys an
assured salary, independently of collections. On
his complaining that the Tivoli doings are a
‘desecration of the British Sunday” :
Dibbs : What is the British Sunday? I have heard of
British heer, but not of British Sunday.
Walker: I think you know what it is.
Dibbs; I don’t know what it is. Do you go to the two
tables of stone for it ?
Walker: Yes.
Dibbs: Then you are out of court You clergy,
you know, are too exacting; and, because you are too
exacting, the people are obliged to resort to these tricks.
But the Parthian shot the bald-headed and spec-
tacled old pelican delivered was perhaps the most
delicious bit of the lot (italics ours): —
Dibbs: At the same time, I tell you this, that, pious
Christians as we all are, when we start to straightlace the
Sabbath too much, we do more harm than good.
A fancy portrait of Dibbs straightlacing the
Sabbath would sell like tote-tickets.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Ned Hanlan, the aquatic light of other days,
clings to his profession in a way painful to behold. Ten
years, or thereabouts, have slipped away since Beach
first rowed him to death, and still he goes on issuing
challenges, and swaggering around in the rags of his
reputation. There never was a sadder case than Hanlan
of a man being unable to do more than one thing. He
can’t turn his hands to anything except sculls, or under-
stand that a mildewed ex-champion, having no young
admirers, loses his interest for the old ones if he stays on
to get beaten by all and sundry. There will soon be
nobody to raise a subscription for the poor extinct
volcano. The latest farce arranged is a double sculling
match on the Thames between Hanlan and Gaudaur
(another of Beach’s ancient victims) in the one boat, and
Sullivan and Harding in the other. Mainly a gate-money
affair on the face of it. Two or three steamboats follow
the race, a few jugginses pay 10s. or £1 for places, and a
vast number of thieves buy tickets on the chance of being
able to plunder the jugginses aforesaid. An odd dozen
or two of demented rowing club boobies may buy the
“colours” of their fancy pair at fancy prices, and
perhaps some riverside-pub. keepers allow a commission
on their extra business. That’s about the size of the
whole matter.

The selection committee has picked the follow-
ing 16 oarsmen from whom to choose eight to represent
N.S.\V. in the coming Interprovincial Eight-oar Race:—
Moor, Waters, Ramsay, M'Murdo, Laing, Kennedy,
Cadell, Aldworlh, Pearson, Cox, Astridge, Williams,
Parkinson, Goulding, Higgs, and Keenan. To commence
with, Aldworth, Pearson, and Cox may be put on one
side as unworthy of consideration. In picking an eight-
oar crew more than individual ability has to be taken into
count, and, taking one consideration with another, the
writer would like to see the province represented thus :—
Stroke Side.
st. lb.
Laing (2) 11 4 N.S.R.O.
Keenan (4) 116 E.S.R.C.
Waters (6) 12 4 N.S.R.C.
Moor (str.) 10 6 N.S.R.C.
45 6
Bow Side.
st. lb.
M‘Donald(b) 10 8 M.R.O.
M'Murdo (3) 11 6 N.S.R.C.
Kennedy (5) 12 6 S.R.O.
Berokelm’n(7)10 8 N.S.R.C.
45 0
The above crew is evenly weighted and composed from
first to last of sterling performers. No doubt a deal of
club jealousy would be caused by the inclusion of five
North Shore R.C. men, but the fact that the North Shore
club has, for a couple of seasons, simply walked away with
all the senior races justifies it. Berckehnan, w ho is not
included in the 16, is the next man after Moor the writer
wou;d pick if selecting an eight, as a good No. 7 is even
harder than a stroke to come across ; and Berckelman
has shown his worth in rowing No. 7 to Moor’s stroke in
the eight-oar victories of the North Shore club ; in addi-
tion to being in five winning senior four-oar crews in
succession. As a matter of fact, the North Shore club,
and the North S tore club only, has dropped across the
correct style of getting an eight through the water, and
if the only consideration was the winning of the Inter-
provinoial race by N.S.W., the victorious North Shore
crew would be picked upon holus-bolus to represent the
province.

The Hawkesbury Racing Club is declining fast.
This is a pity, as every penny taken at the gate is devoted

Dooley, of Sydney, is matched against Laing.
Taking the line through Goddard, the half-caste should
win. Then Dooley, as regards condition, seems to have
gone over the line which cannot be reorossed. Better for
him to fight with all his fat on than try to get into trim in
a few weeks. But he is one of those nervous men who
show best in an uphill fight where little is expected from
them.

Carnage may be a better horse than Carbine
was at the same age, for Donald Wallace’s, or rather Dan
O'Brien’s, colt went down before Ensign in the V.ll.O.
Derby, hut atoned for defeat a few days after. Still, it
must he remembered that Carbine trained on, whereas
Carnage, like many others, may decline at four or five.
No horse, at the end of his three-year-old career, had a
belter record than Trident, hut it fell to pieces when he
met the Australian Peer the following spring. Then, as
three-year-olds. The Peer was Abercorn’s equal, if not
superior, hut afterwards there was no comparison.

In Capel Court, never.
It grieves Broken Hill Wilson to learn that the
public are a lot more anxious about the health of Carnage
than they are of his own. Why not? A small percentage
of the public has benefited by (backing) Carnage, but who
has grown fat through Mr. Wilson?

The “gentleman jock.” is as hard to handle as
the professional article. Not long since, in a Corinthian
race near Sydney, an owner decided to keep his horse
for a future Saturday, and gave the “gentleman” rider
orders, at the last moment, to run a bye. “Too late,”
quoth the gent., “I’ve backed the horse to win me a
nice httle stake, and I’m going to ride for all he’s
worth.” The owner only just had time to rush back to
the paddock and get his punter to put the stuff on.

Though it may interfere with the Distressed

jockey-boys for bad language, while the boss starter
indulges in eloquence which would make a bullock-driver

Denying that four lines of doggerel related
to a councillor, a Vic. shire engineer wrote :

most loathsome diseases to the day of my death.

his wife followed the plough, said lady being

N.S.W, Government proposes to take the
Sydney Outer Domain from the control of
Botanical Gardens curator Moore, and vest it in
trustees as a “ park.” Which would prevent the
holding, “save with the trustees’ consent,” of
public meetings there (a public meeting being de-
fined as one consisting of over 10 persons)
and thus block the big Sunday gatherings
of Socialists and others. If the bull-headed
Dibbs wants to infuriate about 20,000 of the
most aggressive and earnest citizens, whose
ideas of Sunday worship take the form
which he is going to abolish, he will go right ahead
with his scheme. He will very soon discover that
even he can’t safely sweep away in one autocratic
act the Sydney Sunday Fair.
Messrs. Haworth, cutlers, of 401 George-sfc.,
Sydney, are doing a large business with the
“Christy bread-knife,” a weapon with a serrated
edge, like a saw or the outer rim of a streak of
lightning. Its special advantage is that it goes
through last week’s stale crust when the usual im-
plement gives up in disgust; that it easily cuts
new bread when the ordinary knife merely bashes
the loaf in some horrifying shape without pene-
trating its dank, tough surface ; and that it does
its work cleanly, unlike the common weapon of
commerce which scatters crumbs over the pre.
mises from the cellar right up to the chimney-top.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bool making is unknown,

A Hymn of the Time.
Where the blue of the Palestine hills casts a shade
o’er the grey of the plain,
Bloody men did a deed that has cursed them for
all the ages to be ;
And, now, in the light of an age herculean, they
slay Christ again—
They slay Him by slaying the poor—by enslaving
the men who were free—
And for naught has Christ died, for the hucksters
who clothed His old temples with shame,
Now spit on his name.
Oh ! Christ, ere a year’s overpast —ere the year
that’s to be is begun
We pray Thee deliver the many who toil ’neath
the whips of the few ;
Burn them, oh Lord, with a flame from a red and
ineffable sun,
They who have stolen the land, and the rains,
and the sea, and the dew ;
Help us, oh ! Many-Times-Slain—distant God,
whom we see through a mist —
Help us, oh Christ!

Australia is now supplying one-thirteenth
of tho total wine consumption of the United
Kingdom. With the exception of France, Spain,
and Portugal, we have passed all competitors, and
our imports into the United Kingdom are fourth
on the list in magnitude.
Foreign critics of Victorian morality will
be glad to get a full report of tho last Gillies
oration. Gillies called them to account, and dis-
posed of their most cruel insinuations with one of
Ids oldest “gags.” It was left for the shiny little
man to restore confidence by accident, for although
he doubtless didn’t intend his remark to apply
to Victoria it is full of comfort all the same.
“ If,” said Gillies, “ we could only induce some of
those gentlemen who have spoken not wisely but
too well, to come here and be told that the colony
was only a little over GO years old—if they could
be shown what the colony had been able to do in
half-a-century, they would be amazed. Some of
them might have been a little hurt by specula-
tions ; but justice was justice notwithstanding
(hear, hear).” A Melbourne bard chants :
A REVELATION.
Our Duncan has said it!
Delighted we read it,
Good news for our credit
Which down in the dust is!
The Law, lately fiouted,
No more shall be doubted,
Suspicion is routed
By “Justice is justice.”
For senators lushing,
All bent upon hushing
Up evidence crushing,
Still strong our disgust is ;
But “pressure” and clatter
(Though Fat Man were falter)
Can’t silence the matter
When Justice is justice.
The Truth, sole and wholly,
For high as for lowly !
We’ll keep the Law holy ;
The boomer w ho bust is,
If guilty of “ hanky ”
In transactions hanky,
Will scarcely any, “ thankee”
When justice is justice.
An end to concealing
Of dark double-dealing,
Now scorn is congealing,
For simple our trust is
In Duncan true-hearted,
Who, ere he departed,
The secret imparted
That justice is justice.
Editor Bulletin, — Centipedes do not
swallow their young. I often turn up broods of
them, sometimes as many as seventeen young in
one clutch. The mother usually gathers up her
family one at a time in the month, passes them
underneath her, until she has them all stowed
away between her legs; then makes for cover.—
John Loader, Edinglassie, Muswellbrook,

Sydney Truth publishes every week a
great slab of an alleged serial described as
“Thirty years reminiscences of Sydney” (copy-
right reserved !), by that much-advertised person,
Timothy Fogarty. Timothy is apparently the
most incurably serious and long-winded man in
N.S.W. A specimen of his “reminiscences”
At the time of my arrival, firewood was brought into
Sydney on wood-carts for sale. The wood was generally
ironbork trees, cut into lengths of about eight or ten feet,
and sold in different parts of the town, blear the Court
House at Darlinghurst, was a great stand—this supply
was generally purchased by the residents of Surry Hills.
A load, say about a ton of th's wood, would cost from
15s. to 20s., according to the supply, but it afterwards
would require to be cut in lengths. Miller and I pur-
chased a large load each, and being strong, vigorous men,
set to work cutting the wood. I borrowed a hand-saw
from my landlord, a German, a good-hearted, jolly fellow,
who laughed heartily when he saw me attacking the job,
but, like a sensible man, he encouraged me. I worked
away, the perspiration teeming off me, and before one
o’clock my hand was quite blistered from holding and
forcing the saw through the wood. When I cooled suffi-
ciently I had a bath ; the bath I constructed out of a
packing case, zinc-lined. Very few houses except large
ones were'supplied with baths in those days. I out
' a hole in the 1 bottom for the water to run out. The
bath was placed in a small wooden room in the
yard, and supplied from the water-tap by a piece of gutta-
percha tubing, and proved a most serviceable article for
the family. After dinner I went over to see my friend ;
Miller was working away, the perspiration teeming off
him, but, unlike me, his hand was not blistered, although
he was using a hand saw: he took the precaution to put
on a strong leather glove. I told him to knock off, and as
soon as he could get ready we would go into town and
purchase a cross-cut saw. This he did, and in about one
hour we were on our way into town and purchased the saw
which I brought home. He promised to be with me in
the morning at six o’clock, when we would set to and cut
my load of wood into short lengths. Miller was over at
time named ; the saw worked well, we were delighted,
and by dinner time we nearly had the wood finished. My
wife arranged to have Mrs. Miller and the children to
spend the evening with us. By four o’clock the wood
was cut and stacked in the shed. Mr. Miller returned
home to change his clothes, and at six o’clock that even-
ing both families sat down to tea as happy as they
possibly could be. Our good wives praising their hus-
bands in turn for the work accomplished, and many a
hearty laugh had we over the wood-cutting. Next day I
went over to help Mr. Miller to cut his wood, and my wife
and children came over in the evening to tea. The wood
being cut, a happy evening was spent with Mrs. Miller
and her family.
It is a gladsome thing to hear that a man made a
hole in the bottom of a zinc case, 30 years ago, so
that the water might run out. And the horror of
it is that he doesn’t mention what he stopped
the hole with while he was standing up in the
case with nothing on him except soap, and wash-
ing himself away back in 1864. This omission
unsettles the reader’s mind. Also, he doesn’t
state whether he dried himself with a towel or
merely stood around until ho evaporated, which
is another dismal gap in the narrative.

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Flumors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the gieat majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour -
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.
Treatment. Cuticura, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
ing, and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, clear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while Cuticura Resolvent, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood ot all
impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.

The survivors of the crew of the coasting
steamer, Kanahooka, wrecked three weeks ago in
the Gulf of Carpentaria, had a particularly rough
time of it. They left the ship in an open boat,
18ft. long, with only two oars. They drifted for
two nights and a day before the wind and sea,
when they struck the coast. The boat capsized
nearly a mile from the shore, on to which it
drifted. Two of the men were unable to
but landed with the assistance of the others. The
party then started to walk towards the Batavia
River. They travelled some miles when the route
became blocked by impenetrable scrubs. T hey
were compelled to return to the boat, and found
that the natives had stolen oars and rowlocks. Tor
days the party kept traversing from the boat to
the scrub, a distance of nearly 15 miles, in the
hope of getting through the scrub. They had
nothing to eat but sand-crabs and berries. Y- om j
of the berries nearly killed them. The men lived
on little else but water, while they dug holes and
partially buried themselves at night as protection
from the mosquitoes and sand-flies. It was
arranged that the second engineer and the second
mate, who were the strongest swimmers in the
party, should push on ahead. This they did, and
after severe trials, swimming the river, dodging
alligators, living on raw beche-de-mer, rotten
anples, rotten cocoanuts and fresh oocoanuts,
which were washed ashore, they reached the
Batavia River mission station. They have since
been brought to Thursday Island.
Dear Bulletin, —After much careful search
for a weak spot in your “missing word” arrange-
ment I have found what may be a weak spot.
“The missing word is placed in a sealed envelope,
&c., and the contents are known only to the
manager of this paper.” Now, I take it, that as
the manager who receives guesses as they arrive is
in a position to recognise their incorrectness at a
glance there may be a possibility of people in the
office getting an occasional inkling of a wrong
word, whereby the chance of somebody finding
the right word might be improved. Without
going further into idle speculations concerning the
manager’s system of treating coupons, I will
challenge your statement that “ every precaution
has been taken to secure absolute secrecy and
fairness.” You can point to the months when
nobody guessed the word as a proof of absolute
secrecy, it is true. All the same, I submit that
there is some possibility of the secrecy not being
absolute. A mesmerist may get hold of the
manager. Why should he know the word which is
placed in a sealed envelope ? Quite unnecessary.
I suggest that the manager write, say, 20 suitable
words on 20 slips of paper and fold them as though
he were conducting a sweep. Twenty words would
be equal to all the available words in the language,
for ten minutes after writing them he will he rni-
able to remember which he selected or which he
didn’t. Then the manager picks one of his folded
slips of paper, encloses it in the envelope, and
burns the other 19 slips. Nobody knows the
missing word.—F.
“ What have you got in your bag, ma V’
“Let me see. Oh ! it is another tin of ‘Fry s
Malted Cocoa.’” “I am so pleased because it
strengthened me when I was so ill.”

ON CHOLERA INFANTUM.-Vol. VII.
“Regulation of the diet constitutes, in fact, the
principal method of treatment for Sporadic

When the mother’s milk is insufficient, Nestle’s
Food is alone to be recommended.” —Pro. Wm. O.

On TREATMENT of RACHITIS.-VoL XVI.
“ In the treatment of rachitis, improper feeding

intestinal disorders which are so dangerous in
infant life. I recommend Nestle’s Infant Food
from personal experience of its value and con-
venience.” —Prof. Senator.
On SCROFULOSIS. —Vol. XVI.
“ What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may
be. briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.” —Prof.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical
School, Glasgow, in an entirely voluntary com-
munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above oilier preparations,and considerably enhances its
value.

Professor Thulinius.—My Dear Sir,-1 feel.l should be want-
ing in duty, did I neglect the opportunity of sending you my
testimony as to the wondrous efficacy of your rheumatic
specific. For the past ten years I have been a, complete
martyr to rheumatism in all its forms. I have tried doctors
. . , with a view of effecting a cure tor this most trying
disease 1 am well known, and scores can testify
that at best 1 could only crawl about with difficulty. . . .
After leaving Little Bay Hospital at the close of last year 1
was persuaded to try a bottle of your “ Thulinius, and in a
week or so afterwards I could get about fairly well. Upon
again suffering a relapse last February, I took another bottle,
with an equally successful result; but at last I determined to
go through a course of treatment, and I have just completed
my fourth bottle, with the gratifying knowledge l hat I am
quite free from pain, can walk any reasonable distance with-
out fatigue, have an excellent appetite, and feel myself again
competent to re-enter my profession, added to which my oft-
repeated attacks of pleurisy have become a thing of the past.
I have not dieted myself in any way, so all the credit is due to
your wonderful remedy, under Providence, that my blood is
becoming purer daily, and its effect upon my liver and kid-
neys most pronoqnced. ... I shall only be too glad
personally to convince fellow-sufferers of the benefits to be
derived from a course of your treatment, as exemplified in
my own case, after ten years’ martyrdom. 1 remain, yours
faithfully, VV. H. NEWTON NEWMAN (Teacher of Elocution
and twenty-five years Actor and Manager),

Moonshine.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It looked to all appearance like the ending of the
night,
Although ’twas only moonshine that had flushed
the east with light,
Time’s signals seemed to signify the night had
had it’s day,
And yet the night was only turning prematurely
grey.
A bold, impulsive rooster thought the night was
almost gone,
Cocksure he saw approaching day he hailed it as
the dawn,
He flapped his wings with conscious strength, then
trumpeted in pride,
And heard his challenge echoed over all the
country-side.
His brethren took the chorus up and kept it up
until
The moon at last, with smiling face, peeped over
Bunkum Hill,
And painful was the silence then, for shame their
cackle hushed,
The cock that crowed the loudest felt the most
severely crushed. /
And mortal men like this mistake the moonshine
for the dawn,
And one man’s self-assurance leads the doubtful
many on.
We credit “ spouters ” if they say, with emphasis
and style,
“Behold! the day is dawning,” when it’s moon-
shine all the while.
Melbourne.
EIFFA.
A woman escaped from the lunatic asylum
at Ballarat the other day, and was re-captured on
the road to Melbourne, She said she wanted to
see Duncan Gillies before he left for England, to
give him a letter of introduction to her aunt in
London. Only a mad woman would do a thing
like that.
Newspaper epitaph on a recent Sydney
suicide: “She was found dead Joy two bailiffs.”
Verily, there are many strange chances in this
world, and nobody knows what strange end he
may come to, or what strange people he may be
found dead by, or what Chinaman may attend
his funeral. After a life of hard work and ill-
fortune, to die alone, by poison, in a miserable
shanty with the rent overdue, and to have one’s
remains discovered by two bailiffs !
The old Kearsage, which sank the Ala-
bama off Cherbourg on June 19, 1864, has, it is
cabled, ended her days by going down in the
Caribbean Sea, Although but a weakly-built
wooden vessel, she has been kept constantly in
commission all over the world since the day of the
memorable fight. Previous to the engagement,
Thornton, Captain Winslow’s executive officer,
suggested to him the idea of tricing her cables up
in layers outside the hull amidships so as to pro-
tect the engines. This was done, in a hurried but
effective manner, and not a shot penetrated that
portion covered by the cable-armour. Had one
done so, a different story would have been told.
John W. Longford, “for many years
senior Warder and recorder at Darlinghurst Gaol,”
but “disrated for a very; trivial error of judg-
ment,” is turning his experience to account in a
16 pp. Bvo, pamphlet, called “ Under Lock and
Key,” to be published serially. The first number
is tilled with threats of awful exposures of Dar-
linghurst mismanagement, but there is nothing
alarming so far, and the introductory eight pages
are dull. Later on come some excellent stories,
which are none the worse for being true:—
The late John Lovett, who rose from warder to b e
governor of Darlinghurst, dearly loved a joke. One day
a friend asked him why he never saw him at Randwick
races. “ Randwick! " replied Lovett, in his well-known
drawling tone, “when I go away from here I like to have 1
a holiday—-a real holiday. I did go to Randwick once, 1
years ago, but I saw so many familiar faces that I couldn’t
help thinking I was on duly all the time 1 "
At Darlinghurst everybody has a nickname.
Here are some prisoners’ titles for the warders :
Long J., Jimmy the Bull, the Racehorse, Lobengula,
Mad Mick, Mickey, the Pig, Drop me a Line, Stumpy J.,
Cough Mixture, German Charlie, Big Liz, Napoleon*
Jimmy the Whisperer, Lord Harris, Straight Edge,
Exactly So, Lobster Face, the Crying Warder, Porky, Dry
Plate, the Braidwood Terrier, Gertie the Gardener, and
Bucky the Marine.
This is a Dubbo Circuit story ;
The calendar was a very heavy one, and there were
several leading barristers up from Sydney, the late David
Buchanan among them. All the accused were provided
with counsel, except one, a hoary-headed old man,
accused of a serious offence. While preliminaries were
being arranged, this individual suddenly stood up and,
addressing the Judge, said: “ Excuse me, sir, but can’t I
have one of these things? (pointing to the bewigged
barristers.) All the others have got one." Counsel were
horrified at this vulgar man, and of course, none offered
to defend him. He had to take his chance, and it hap-
pened, oddly enough, that of all the prisoners who stood
at the bar during the whole sitting he was the only one
acquitted.
On another occasion, in a country town where the
inhabitants were notorious sheep-stealers :
“ Gentlemen of the jury,” said the Judge’s Associate,
“ you will, when your names are called, please take your
seats in the usual places,” and forthwith the first mau
walked into the. dock followed by a second, before the
horrified officials could interpose.

WALTZ MUSIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
Round and round,
As the world swings, so swing we,
Planets on one course set free.
Come what may, this hour has found
My heart beating close to thee.
Circle on,
Faint not, fair feet silken-shod.
That upon my heart have trod,
Limbs I’d die to gaze upon,
Circle still, my sun, my god !
Long, how long
I have waited till this hour
Bring my life to perfect flower,
I have suffered scorn and wrong,
Fled, yet could not flee thy power.
If I {?o,
Empty is the world beyond;
Dead as if a wizard’s wand
Wrought a moon-cold waste of snow
Where her face shines not, fierce or fond.
If in dreams
I behold her, she who keeps
Love a slave that laughs or weeps,
Life a glass of swift sand-streams,
Time a chasm Hope o’erleaps—
If my face, . .
Pressed to hers, makes sleep divine,
As a draught of charmed wine
(Though not mine that happy place.
And that pillow sweet not mine) —
Yet the ghost
Of the rapture that I have nob
Far outrides the lips I crave not
Of the rose-crowned maiden host—
Lips whose kisses lose not, save not.
If I wake
To her cold and careless glance,
There’s a warm, white breast the'dance
Stirs to panting breaths that shake
All the outer walls of chance.
White is she.
White as snow, as fire is white.
As a star-flame in the night,
Only burning cold to_me,
Scorching to a nearer sight.
If I span
With my arm that slender shape.
In the dance there’s no escape ;
Let her fly me if she can,
Though the gulf of Judgment gape!
Near, so near,
Wheeling thus, I breathe her breath,
And the earth whirls underneath
With a joy as deep as fear,
Awful as the kiss of death.
Oh, my own !
(Since one moment with my arm
I may hold thee as a charm,
Call thy beauty mine alone,
Circle, circling thee from harm.)
Tirae that flies
Shall not give this hour again ;
Love that wanes, as moons that wane,
Faints not ever in thine eyes
If thy breast his head disdain.
From thy scorn
He may seek some refuge still
Over valley, over hill,
Through the night and on to morn—•
And thy day-break lone and chill.
Then in vain—
Vain to call him, name on name,
With wide eyes and lips aflame—
Shall to-night return again
'To morrow night and be the same ?
Nay, be wise!
Dear brown eyes that gaze as though
Slumbered still the spirit’s glow
Ere its sun of love arise—
Who shall ever love thee so ?
Better now,
Now to take a whole life’s gift
Than to wait with watchful thrift
And a white-wreathed maiden brow,
As the slow days death ward drift.
On thy breast
Pale tube-roses faint are drooping;
I will give thee for thy stooping
Orange flowers of golden crest
In white robes as angels grouping.
Bronze-brown hair!
They shall wreathe thee, crown thee, make
Monarch of thee for my sake !
Thou a woman art, and fair;
To a woman’s queendom wake !
Round and round !
White and warm and silken-swathed
As a fragrant flower is spathed,
Perfumed tresses lily-crowned,
All in ball-room radiance bathed.
Round and round !
Till the world whirls out of sight,
And the stars dance in the night;
Round my heart a serpent wound,
Long and supple, warm and white.
Round and round!
So the music leads us ever—
As two leaves float down a river.
We are vanquished by the sound.
Closer cling—oh, leave me never !
Round and round !
So I clasp thine hand, and draw
Thy soul homewards by Love’s law.
Till two spirits lost and found,
Grow one soul without a flaw.

all nations. Country friends are particularly
invited to take this rare opportunity of selecting
from immense and varied stocks the choice
bargains which will tend to make homes happy.
The God-Fearing Candidate.
Extract from the election-address of a “ God-
fearing ” candidate who proposes standing for
several Australian constituencies at next general
election :
To the Electors. —Gentlemen,—A sacred and
solemn duty lies before you, which can best be
performed by electing me. I can no longer refrain
from coming forward, having received a call
which, as a God-fearing man, I dare not disobey—
viz., the call of the righteous conference of clergy-
men, held in August of last year. A conscious-
ness of the desperate state of the country, and a
knowledge that the demand for God - fearing
candidates is more than equal to the supply,
alone overcomes my modesty. There were
several other men of undoubted character and
probity, whose sterling qualities would certainly
nave caused me toetface myself and humbly support
them as an inferior labourer in the vineyard. They
were, like myself, God-fearing men. But they
are all, unfortunately, dead [and probably their
worst fears are now realised. —Ed. B.] While
thus acknowledging my inferiority to the dead, I
acknowledge no superiors in virtue amongst the
living. I present herewith a short biography and
programme, extracted from the Daily Morning
Howl, and written by the religious editor of that
paper:—
I was born in England or Scotland. No God-
fearing men are ever born elsewhere; and the
native Australian youth are invariably profane
and irreligious. At an early age I attended
Sunday-school in my native village, and subse-
quently taught there. I always touched my hat
to the squire, the parson, and those whom
Providence had placed in authority over us.
During my Sunday-school pupilage I often had
my ears pinched by grown-up teachers of both
sexes. During my later stages as teacher I
pinched in turn the ears, and surreptitiously
smacked the cheeks of the religious youth of Great
Britain. To this treatment of myself I owe my
present position as a God-fearing candidate for
Parliament. I trust my treatment of others has
led to the same happy results. At the age of 29
I had made considerable progress in miscellaneous
piety, was already bald, and shaved my upper-lip.
(The latter characteristic is an unfailing mark of
the pious.) I married a fellow Sunday-school
teacher of the opposite sex, mainly through the
representations of her father and six of her biggest
brothers. This circumstance will show the esteem
in which I was held, and the eagerness with which
an alliance with me was sought. To the loving
ministrations of my wife I owe much. After
being a member of the local Cobden Club, to
which I contributed many of my earliest pennies,
I emigrated to Australia, and started in busi-
ness. Needless to say, I have been very success-
ful. I have been a large employer of labour, and
was the first to introduce the system of com-
mencing the day’s work with prayer (of course,
deducting the time from the men), and I never
employed any but God-fearing men like myself,
whose aspirations after treasure Above led them
to work at reduced wages here Below.
I was elected alderman soon after I became rich
enough to subscribe to all the local charities, race
clubs and church funds. lam a prominent mem-
ber of the Social Gimlet Society, and have a
remarkably quick eye at a keyhole.
In politics I am, of course, a firm believer in
Freetrade and freedom of contract ; in fact, of
absolute freedom in everything—but religion.
I believe in opening the proceedings of Parlia-
ment with prayer, and will do all I can to achieve
that reform. In fact, I believe in opening every-
thing with prayer; and hope that some day in
Possumland nor even an oyster will be opened
without it.
As to taxation, I believe the best interest of the
God-fearing portion of the inhabitants can best
be served by judiciously taxing the other fellow.
I am in favour of a single-tax on land, which I
consider equitable and just, as I do not own any
land myself.
I object to payment of Labour members. Most
of them come from the improvident classes, and
will only spend their salaries on champagne,
caviare and devilled kidneys on toast, leaving
their families unprovided for, and imperilling the
British constitution. None but God-fearing men
should be paid for their services—the value of
which is enhanced by the prayers of the faithful.
I believe in closing up everything but the
churches on Sundays.
lam a strong advocate of flogging and hanging
as a means of suppressing the other fellow. I
should prefer hanging outright, but in these
degenerate times the maudlin sentimentalists have
the upper hand, and we must be content with
small mercies, until the House is composed
entirely of God-fearing men like myself.
If elected, I shall attach myself to the party of
that pure and noble patriot, Sir Sneakurn Sham,
whose venerable grey hairs are a testimony to his
piety, and from whose lips issue at all times the
most noble and elevated sentiments of patriotism
and morality.
I believe in Possumland federating with those
colonies where God-fearing men are at the head of
affairs. I shall oppose to the utmost of my power
any federation with the ungodly colonies of South
Australia and Mapriland.
I am strongly opposed to sweeps, consultations,
and totes, but regularly attend church bazaars,
raffles, and distributions of work,»~oyhich, con-
ducted on God-fearing principles, are a source of
revenue to the Church, and a blessing toman-
kind.
I am also in favour of One-man-one-vote—that
one man to be the man of property.
To those who are alive to the Best Interests of
the Country I need say no more. Living as we
are at a time when the disastrous effects of class
representation are upon us, those to whom I
appeal will give a ready response. Would the
present depression have existed if our statesmen
had commenced their proceedings with earnest
prayer? I cannot think so. What has intimi-
dated the British money-lenders (all God-fearing
men) but the irreligious tendencies of our
colonies? It is nonsense to say that it
was the locking up of =£24,000,000 to prop up the
Baring firm’s Argentine losses, and the conse-
quent withdrawal of that amount from the
investment market. Such assertions can only
carry conviction to the benighted and the un-
godly. When our Legislature is swept of the un-
righteous who now pollute it, and filled with men
who, like myself, are God-fearing, and who will
earn their salaries by prayer alone, then will the
God-fearing British investor yield to us once more
his confidence. As the Book says “ Tis not by
works alone, but by prayer,” &c., so not only
shall we have our Minister of Public Works, but
our Minister of Public Prayer. And, feeling this,
I place myself in the hands of the Almighty and
His electors, and will pray earnestly that their
hearts may be softened towards me.—l am,
gentlemen, yours obediently,
BRIGHAM YOWLMAN.
