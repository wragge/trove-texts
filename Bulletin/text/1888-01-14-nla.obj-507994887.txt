The Brutality of Competition.
“ Noble spinners ! We have gained a hundred
thousand pounds, which is mine; the three-and-
sixpence daily was yours. Adieu; drink my
health with th’s groat each, which I give you over
and above.” —From the address of Plugson, the
manufacturer , to his workmen -
Carlyle.
It is almost universally assumed by the sort
of political economy which is taught in uni-
versities and believed in by the powers that
be, that the chief and distinguishing glory of
the present era of industrialism is the lovely
theory of competition, by which it is unc-
tuously announced the best man always tills
the best place. The terrible waste and loss
to humanity of splendid energy and culti-
vated talent, which is worn away in the
hideous attrition of competition, is never
mentioned, or only with a sort of impatience,
as one of those trivial concomitants of pro-
gress hardly worth considering in our mag-
nificent and highly-developed civilisation.
Yet this fact is always staring us in the face,
as the unvarying result of competition the
wide world over, namely : The harder a man
works the more he deteriorates the value of
his labour, and almost in reverse proportion
as he receives a smaller and smaller wage,
caused by the increasing cheapness of the
article which he is employed in manufactur-
ing and the competition of the labour of
others against his own, is he compelled to
pay a higher and higher rate for the privi-
lege of existence. Manufactured articles
have an inevitable tendency to become
cheaper ; food products to become dearer.
Notwithstanding that the harder a man
works the cheaper his labour becomes, yet
we have the anomaly of the capitalist, who,
the less he works and the more he can per-
suade others to work for him, the richer he
becomes, and the greater the control he ob-
tains over the results of others’ labour, and
ultimately over their lives and their fates.

Laurence Gronlund, who holds the same
position in regard to social science that
Hackel holds in regard to physical t cience—
taking Henry George as the parallel to
Darwin —says :
“ We should all be starving within one year,
naked •within three, and houseless within ten
years, if Capital was not constantly being re-
created by Labour.”
But the labourer, although the creator of
the world’s wealth, participates least in the
enjoyment of what he creates. He competes
against his fellow man for whom otherwise
he probably entertains the kindliest affec-
tion, simply that some few in the world
should have so much of the world’s goods as
to be able to waste more than they use.
Giles hates Hodge, because he fears that
Hodge will oust him from his place in the
gutter where they are both struggling for a
bone, while Crcesus looks on smoking a
fragrant Havana, his well-digested dinners
hanging in fatty folds about his big prosper-
ous neck and the g.rth of his vest of phe-
nomenal and truly capitalistic pr jportions.
Crcesus smiles his fat, greasy smile at the
canaille cutting each other’s throats there in
the gutter—for his (Crcesus’) exclusive bene-
fit. These poor fools do not get a
bare subsistence wage, simply because
they do not subsist as they should in
order to do the work expected from
them. Their homes are hovels. Crcesus
lives in a palace. They eat coarse and in-
nutritious food. Crcesus, the capitalist,
fares sumptuously every day and dines at the
Cafe de Paris. The lives of these two claseea
are different absolutely. The one labours
simply in order to live, while the other
enjoys the marrow of life on the fruits of
his brother’s labour without working at all.
The author of the “ Co-operative Common-
wealth ” breaks out indignantly with—
“ * If there be in this world a partnership be-
tween men which is natural, wise, and useful,’
one of our American * statesmen ’ is fond of de-
claiming, ‘ it is the partnership between Capital
and Labour.' Indeed, Capital and Labour are
just as harmonious as roast beef and a hungry
etomaoh. There Is the most beautiful harmony,
the most natural partnership between the two —
when they are united in one hand. But what
another contemptible juggling with words we
here have ! As If there were no difference at all
between Capital and individual ‘ capltal-isfs !
. . . Capital and Labour, Siamese Twins 1
Are capitalists and labourers Siamese Twins ?
Why ? Because they are in contact with each
other J So are the horse leech and its victim.”
♦ ♦ »
In order that some idea may be formed of
the true relations between Capital and
Labour, and the use the former makes of its
remorseless weapon, Free Competition, it
will ba necessary to quote a few figures
taken from the American census reports,
which are true of the relations of Capital
and Labour in every country where the
curse of the Industrial era his penetrated
and gained sway. These figures are supplied
by Gronlund, and we summarise from Lis
admirable work on Democratic Socialism.
We find by tur.in2 to lha United States
census report of 1880—a faidy prosperous
year—that the employer paid the worker on
an average £69 4s. in wages, and fleeced, on
an average, from him the sum of £64 14s
Hence we get these deductions. He who
employed 10 workmen gained £647 ; he who
employed 25, gained £l6lB ; the employ-
ment of 50 secured £3235 ; of 100. the sum
of £6470 ; of 500 workmen, £32.350 ; and
of 1000 workmen, £64,700. Says Gron-
lund
“ Nearly sixty-five thousand pounds this latter
employer gained, fleeced, ‘accumulated’ (mark!)
in one year ! For what! What had the workers
in return 1 The privilege each to earn sixty nine
pounds four shillings. The privilege to use the
soil, the machinery, and all the resources of our
civilisation, which this employer possesses !”
• • a
The foregoing figures are very instructive.
The more extensive the operations of capital
the greater the “loot.” The system is a
beautiful one. It has no final ty. Not until
the entire earth becomes the sole property
of one magnificent J ay-Gouldish capi alist
who shall swallow up the smaller fry will the
present system of industrialism reach the
apex of its development. The whole thing
is a regular engine for spoliation. It is
worked with almost ludicrous simplicity.
After paying for raw material, plant, rent,
and interest, a large surplus remains on the
selling price of a manufactured article which
represents the application of Labour to its
production. Does Labour receive this sur-
plus created by itself ? Oh, no ! Labour re-
ceives, perhaps, 50 per cent, or 45 per cent.,
or even 30 per cent., and the remainder goes
into the pocket of the philanthropic capital-
ist, and he calls it profit. The equally
philanthropic bushranger calls it “ the
swag. ” Now this fleecing of ‘' j, rofit ” —t he
sum which represents the margin between
the cost of production and the selling price
of an article—is simple appropiiation—just
that and nothing else. And the appropria-
tion is cruelly and callously enforced by that
beautiful modern institution called Fiea
Competition. Man is pitted against man,
fathi r against son. They slave and sweat and
die that a man like themselves may enjoy good
dinners, rent a box at the opera, take his
airings in a private yacht, and drive his
jewel-bedizened wife abroad in a gaily-ap-
pointed barouche. Men consent to starve
themselves and their children in order that
one man may have more than he wants ; in
order that one man may indulge in criminal
and inhuman waste.
• • •
It all comes about thus : Some few, by
fair means ir foul, have managed to obtain
control of the souraesof production. They are,
indeed, very few—insignificant, compared to
the vast army of the dispossessed who are will-
ing to make great concessions to the for-
tunate usurpers to get back little bits of
their own agaia. But they never get any-
thing back. They simply are allowed to
use the sources of produc ion for the benefit
of the unjust holder. In return ttey obtain
the right to live as cheaply as they can. They
—the white wage slaves—ire so numerous
that they will work for less than food. They
sometimes die of slow starvation, these serfs,
white of skin and Aiyan by descent. But
the capitalist is generous. He contributes a
dole to the parish for the burial of h!s wern-
out white wage slaves.
* * *
When the one labourer erects his spine in
a new laud and ten employers humbly be-
seech him to work for them, to name his
price, and they compete against each other for
the almost inestimable boon of his assistance,
whatever he receives is probably the true value
of his labour, because the employers could ha ve
no object in paying him anything he did not
earn. Suppose he received for his day’s
labour one pound sterling, had there been
ten labourers, and no greater facilities for
their employment than for the one, the
ruling rate of wages per diein would have
been two shillings a man. Free Competition,
and Free Competition alone, would have
brought this about.
* * *
Now, is the capitalist justified in taking
advantage of the necessities of his white
wage slaves ? No ! because if he be, the
highwayman has just as good an excuse.
The one robs by means of hunger, the other
by means of an army Colt’s. It is illogical
to elect one robber to Parliament and to
send the other to Bernina Gaol. Each lives
by appropriating, against their will, the re-
sults of the labour of their fellows, only the
highwayman is the loss sinner of the two.
It is frequently advanced taab as under
existing social conditions Labour cannot
apply itself to the processes of production
without the initial assistance of Capital,
therefore Capital should be regarded as
performing a rather philanthropic function
in making the action of Labour possible. It
must be remembered that the very shackles
that hobble the movements of Labour in this
connection are the outcome of the unjustly
assumed prerogatives of Capital Again,
Capital makes its first assistance an engine
for subsequent spoliation. Its philanthropy
is the philanthropy of the burglarious crow-
bar, which bursts open the bank i f hum n
industry and enables the capitalist to annex
the contents. Similarly, and quiteas logically,
it would be just to compliment the midnight
housebreaker upon the energy and enter-
prise which moved him, no doubt it some
consideiable expense, to supply hincs If with
the tools wherewith to pick the locks and
remove the bars of the bauk he exploits.
We must always remember that in this
age of industrialism nothing is made because
it is wanted. Nothing is undertaken to
benefit the race. All enterprise, all busi-
ness energy and speculation are put in motion
to secure “profit,” Only that, and nothing
else. Contractors do not build railways in
order to afford work to navvies. Lord
Brassey does not run steel rails from I ndus
to the Pole out of any love to the class he
Sprang from. Oh, no ! His business is to
make money—“ profit.” All the money in
the world is slowly focussing. It is slowly,
gradually, gathering to a single centre. It
is aggregating into one pocket. If the
present system continues, there will ulti-
mately be a single monster capitalist. 3 lion
the remainder will awaken to the situation,
and possibly destroy him, or imprison him,
or otherwise put it out of his power further
to harm his fellows. Here is a singularly
beautiful theory of compensation. The
wealth of the world is slowly aggregating
into one pocket. Yet, as the capitalistic
ring narrows, the danger which threatens
the capitalist increases. His daily life is a
hideous struggle against an unknown enemy.
He sees hatred in men’s eyes, and fears for
his vast wealth, and struggles to keep it, if
hut to disperse it to the four winds of
heaven at his death. “Give peace in our
time; O, Lord !” is his constant prayer.
* •
If there is truth in science ; if Spencer
and Hackel, Darwin and Henry George,
Karl Marx and Gronlund are net gibber-
ing lunacies ; if evedutien ii anything and
means anything, tbs preamt t-ya.em of
things will be washed aw*y, like an incor-
rect sum on a child’s s’ate. We knoiv this
mvst ba so. Democratic Socialism is steadily
marthirg forward. In those countries now
enjoying the al eged benefits of representa-
tive gevernmeat the workmen have every-
thing in their own hands. Their aim must
be to control the elections, to manipulate
the caucus, to gradually but surely get a
firm and unflinching grip of the already
existing machinery of government. Work-
men must everywhere organise, or-
ganise, organise. They must sink petty
differences, consolidate their voting power
the crushing force of the ballot—they
must keep their heels firmly down on the
faces of the calculating demagogues who
strive, out of silly and trivial agitations, to
make political reputations. Workmen must
never bother about little reforms. They
must combine in action to secure the great
principle, and they will do it every time.
There must be no multiplicity of organisa-
tions, no diversity of aims. One great
organisation, one great platform upon which
all workmen can meet—-this will conquer
everything. The removal of taxation from
the shoulders of indnsLy and the placing of
it upon land, and combination to keep
up the rate of wages, should be the two
planks of supreme importance. But stop
not at this. Carry the war into the enemy’s
country. Compete against capital. Co-
operate! Co-operate!! Co-operate!!! This
one word summarises all the law and the
prophets of the industrial movement. In-
stead of getting the assistance of that
initial capital from the appropriator of the
results of your labour, by combination
keep up wagts sufficiently to enable you to
stem a litcle of the results of your own
labour, and then—Co-operate ! Meet Capi-
tal cn its own ground. It cannot exi t
apart from Labour. This shows its assump-
tive and unreal character. It is not in itee.f
the treasure ; the .reasure lies locked up in
the safe, the initial capital is the crowbar
which prises the safe-door open. Make your
own crowbars and co operate, for therein is
the death-knell of the class that can live in
affluence without personal industry.
The Coming Invasion.
The British Jingoes, in their treatment of Aus-
tralia, model their conduct on that of the nurse-
maids of our early youth. They cajole with the
titles which are to grown men what rattles are to
babies ; they coax with the gushing phrases of
endearment and patronage, they bribe with the
bauble of glory, and, when all else scorns likely to
fail, they trot out the bogie of foreign invasion
to frighten Australia into the desired partnership
in the work of military murder. Recently the
bogie has been very much in vogue. Promises,
patronage and the prospect of glory have not
raised our Imperial enthusiasm worth a cent, so
now the ghost of national danger is raised to tor
rify the people of these seas into permanent na-
tional dependence. “ Become the servants of the
Empire or you will become the slaves of another
nation,” is the substance of the speeches recently
made by Carnarvon. Parkks, Gillies, and
even in an apologetic kind of way by M‘ Arthur.
T he alleged impotence of Australia in military
affairs is contrasted with the alleged rapacity of
fore'gners, and dependence upon Britain is
asserted to be the only hope of national salvation
for these States. That such an alliance would
prop up the decaying military prestige of Great
Britain, and enable the Tories once more to
swagger round Europe, is one of the inconsequen-
tial fac f s which do not enter into immediate con s
sideration. It is Australia’s safety, not
Britain’s advantage, which prompts] these Jing 0
pro* Australian Carnarvon’s to agitate the ques-
tion of Imperial Federation.
• * *
Considering Australia’s resources in men an
money, it is an imputation of cowardice to
that these States could not defend themsolv e g
against foreign aggression. Is patriotism non-
existent on this continent ? Are the incentives
that aroused American valour and energy 100
years ago not present in Australia to-day ? Pat-
riot'sm and the instincts of self-defence may be at
the present obscured by the m’serable cloak of
dependence which Australia now wears, but they
exist a-d are powerful all the same. If, as the
British Jiogors admit, the d sired offensive and
defensive alliance with Australia would give
England a louder voice in the councils of Europe,
it is absurd to suppose that these States have no
aggressive might. And the- power of defence
would be 50 ti-res the power of aggression. To
argue that Australia cannot maintain her own
integrity, while admitting that she could strike
potent blows abroad, is manifestly fallacious. If
the British Jingo party did not desire the military
assistance of Australia, the argument in favour of
Imperial Federation, based on our own alleged
national impotence, might possibly avail to prove
something ; but, in the face of that desire, the
assertion can cany no weight whatever. In
sizing up the “bogie” it is necessary to notice
the limits to the strength of ary invading party.
No invader could sail from any port less than 9000
miles away, and, in spite of all the military ad-
vantages arising from the use of steam-power,
this distance from the base of operations would
be of great risk and consequence. And the net-
work of railways and telegraph lines covering in-
habited Australia would give the defenders ad-
vantages unknown to the American patriots of
1756. If Melbourne were threatened a Sydney
contingent could be transported thither within 20
hours of the time of alarm : men could be speeded
across from Dubbo to A delaide, or from Bourko
to Brisbane, in 18 hours. There is here every
facility for the rapid concentration of forces, and
an enemy effecting a landing would have to face,
within 18 hours, all the military strength of three
States. An independent Australia could be relied
upon to use all her advantages for defence to the
uttermost. Under the tutelage of the Empire,
and with Imperial warships in our harbours, the
work of defence is undertaken in a desultory
half-hearted fashion, and these colonies, with the
support of England, are probably weaker, even
for repelling an invasion, than without her.
* * *
It is furthermore of c:nsequence to notice that
the danger of invasion would be removed almost
beyond possibility by the advent of Australian in-
dependence. It cannot be too often affirmed that
our only present danger of invasion arises from
the probability of Britain’s becoming involved in
war. Australia has no enemies of her own, and
can have none so long as foreign interference
forms no part of our policy. But out of our pre-
sent dependence dangers are prone to threaten*
for England’s enemies are Also the foes of Austra-
lia. Before B. R. Wise* the present New South
Wales Attorney-General, started to serve a sentence
of Imperial grovel with the Parkes party he upheld
these views strongly, and figured as a deVotee to
the cause of Australian independence, but the
disastrous spell of Parkesian lunacy enveloped
him, and now 1m is as obsequious and subservient
as the rest of the crowd who whoop for Jingoism.
Independent Australia would be able when all
Europe was in tumult to extend her commerce,
and exchange her products in every part of the
World. Australia dependent upon England would
respond to every thrill of European terror, and
when England ws S at war would be shut out as
a belligerent from the markets of the world. The
disasters of war would be her portion although
the objects to be won were not of the remotest
concern to her people. Brisbane might be bom*
barded because Ferdinand of Bulgaria was de-
posed. Sydney might be shelled because Abdur-
rahman Khan proved treacherous.
* * *
The Imperial bogie points rather to foreign
rapacity than to foreign hostility. The idea seems
to be that if Australia were carelessly left lying
loose around, some covetous foreigner would
swoop along and annex it bodily. But nations
are not in the habit of risking such felonies. Chili,
Peru, the Argentine Republic, and dozens of
other little States have never been protected b>
the Imperial shield, but yet they have not been
annexed, and have held their own when the great
Powers of Europe grew rusty. Australia is far
more capable of defending herself than they are ;
she is a Continent —not a paltry little territory,
and the Anglo-Saxon is surely the equal of the
Hispano- American. Acts of annexation of such a
class are entirely out of date, and, If they were
not, the surrounding seas would ensure the safety
of Australasia. The only danger to be feared in
a state of independence would be the Jingoism,
compounded of arrogance and covetousness, of
those who would seek to include under the Aus-
tralian name the small, and, to us, worthless,
islands of the Pacific. They could not be pro


tected, even under the Imperial regime, if a care-
fully planned attack upon one of them were made.
But if the Monroe doctrine, as applied to these
colonies, is strictly confined to the mainland of
Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania, the “ Im-
perial bogie ” raised up to induce our submission
may be relegated to oblivion. This appeal to our
supposed cowardice is about the last, as it is the
meanest, of the Imperial devices to bind Australia
with dishonourable fetters of slavish dependence.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Paddington Election
The retirement of Mr. Trigkbtt into the hcspita
for decayed intellects, known as the New £outl
Wales Upper House, has resulted in a wild and
eager scramble for the vacant seat, and the Prc
tectionists, as is their wont, are found unprepared
As we write, no less than tour candidates are en
gaged in a wild-cat struggle for the dubiou
honour of a place in the Assembly, and dusty fad
and lunacies without number are being trotted
out by the carpet-baggers of the political world
The old, tattered, wilted, half-mast flag o
“Pakkbs and Good Government” is again le
oose to the breeze, and the Freetrade Association
is doing its utmost to get a solid vote for the gooc
cause which is identified with cheap nigger-made
goods, insolvency, Circular Quay jobbery, the
Naval Defence swindle, and the Dead House in
the swamp. The softgoodsmen of York-stree
have rolled up as one importer of foreign shoddy
and their chosen candid ate, Mr. H bllmit ch, despite
his record as the dullest of political mediocrities, wil
receive all the support which they can command
Parkbs, so far, has wisely kept his own person
ality as much as possible in the background, anc
the Freetrade candidate is spared the blighting in
fluence of the first importer of coolie labour, anc
is not actively cursed by the presence o
the man of syndicates, dubious land speou
lations, and Imperial grovel. But, unfor
t’lnately, the other malign shadow of New South
Wales politics is not wise enough to imitate this
policy of reserve. Mr. Dibbs, with his record of
past bungling, and his awkward associations with
schemes for Centennial drunks, is botching his
hardest on behalf of the Protectionist cause, and
the first result of his dire stupidity is the with
drawal of the Protectionists, as an organised
body, from the contest. Mr, W. J. A llen, the
sturdy supporter of the cause of local, as
distinguished from German, British, anc
Chinese industry, is not acceptable to
the long-drawn-out autocrat, and in his
place he wished to substitute an almost
unknown man, whose pants have a more graceful
hang, and whose boots wear a more reliable polish
Failing in this Mr. Dibbs stands out, and leaves
the representative of his opinions to fight as a free
lance, with the aid of such support as the pat-
riotic section of the electors may accord in de-
fiance of their miserably unpatriotic chief. It
remains for tbe people to decide whether the
welfare of their coun'ry or the wounded suscep-
tibilities of Mr. Dibbs are of greater account.
The wooden god of the Prot°c ionist party
solemnly disowns all share in the struggle anc
clambers back to its perch; the wooden god of
the Freetraders, meanwhile, remains on its pedes-
tal and wisely refrains from inflicting on its wor-
shippers the curse of its active interference. The
contest, apparently, will be fought out cn the one
main issue of Freetrade v. Protection —the taxa-
tion for revenue purposes of articles which
New South Maps caiv ot produce, against
the taxation, for revenue and protective pur-
poses combined, of articles which she can
manufacture for herself, thereby furnishing em-
ployment for tire Australian workman in place of
for the slave-driven p oletariat of the Old World.
So long as the Customs House endures New
South Wales is governed under the policy of Pro-
tection. The question which remains to be set-
tled is whether it shall be Protection for the
Chinaman, the Coolie, the German, and the Eng-
lishman, or whether it shall be for the Australian,
at present the only man who is not protected in
New South Wales.
The British Hors* Mai in©.
During the last month the chronic war scare of
Europe has passed through an unusually severe
stage. The Great Powers, severally, individually,
and collectively, tave been standing on (he verge
of a life-or-doath struggle with themselves or
each other, or with somebody or something, for
some reason which nobody knew anything a tout,
and though no one had any distinct idea who was
going to light or what they were going to light
for, reserves have been called out and armies
have been rushed about in frantic haste to
nowhere in particular, and hard-up emperors
have been trying to raise money for a campaign
and haven’t boon able to rape it, and have got
mad in consequence a* d have called out more
reserves The air has been full of that impalpable
thing called “mobilisation,” and for a while there
to be a fair chance that some 8,000,000
Soldiers wou'd go out to butchery without any
single individual knowing why. Even England
has taken the alarm and has added £lOOO to the
Duke of Cambridge’s annual screw, and a huge
iron-clad was hastily put to sea, but the bottom
fell out of her before she had gone a mile. Aus-
tralia, as the satellite of England, has also
suffered in a slight degree from the same fath rn-
less panic, and the drapery Bashi-hazouks
of Victoria have been discussing the advisability
of inviting Lord Wolselby, the hero who rose in
the dead of night and squelched Arabi and his
half-armed Copts, to come out at a high price and
inspect the defences of Australia, in order that he
might recommend the expenditure of more money
on guns and fortifications, and rouse up a spirit
of loyalty among the excited colonial warriors
against the time when Britain next goes out to
murder some little nigger who is asleep in bed
and doesn’t know she is coming. Under the exist-
ing Imperial regime it is always considered ad-
visable, whenever a nation which is located
16,000 miles away, and which the colonists have
never seen, finds itself drifting into war, and
doesn’t know why it is doing it, that Australia
should prepare to lick somebody that she never
heard of, and whom she doesn’t know from Adam,
and, in such a case, the correct thing is to import
a high-priced British horse-marine to give advice
and then go away again. Why this should be
the correct thing no one knows, but it is so.
Britain, at present, has no fortifications worth
speaking of ; her Generals—and she has more than
6to of them—arc perpetually asking what will be-
come of their country if it should be invaded, and
not one of them knows ; and her great sol-
diers of the present generation have fought
against nothing larger than the little nigger afore-
said, and have more than once been defeated
even by him. The British army of to-day loses
its way in an autumn manoeuvre in its own
country, and can’t find itself again without the
aid of a diagram ; the British navy has neither
bottom nor sides; and the British Government
has a hideous knack of wading into foreign com-
plications, and then not knowing how to get out.
It becomes a question, therefore—always suppos-
ing that it is absolutely necessary for Australia to
enter upon a path of bloodshed —whether she
should not endeavour to And some mo e reliable
and less costly guide to slaughter than the British
ammunition-waggon officer of the period. A Ger-
man general of repute could be obtained for a
reasonable figure, and the German soldier has
proved, by actual demonstration, that he
knows how to do something more than
back out whenever a white man tells
him to go; a Turk, such as Osman of Plevna,
could teach the 4 ustralians how to turn a mud-
walled village into a fortress and hold it for six
months without a cent, against a stupendous
army ; but so long as the bulk of the British army
is required to evict old women in Ireland, and
London itself is left open to any sudden raid, we
decline to believe in the value of British advice
in the matter of fortification and internal defence,
The eminfnb dancing officers who came out to
look after the defence of Australian cities have
themselves never defended a city except against
Arabs and Burmese, and have not one in a'l
Britain that is capable of defence, and their high-
priced foreign ignorance is an article which is
hardly worth paying for.
♦
The old Freetrade Lie.
The Paddington election contest has again
brought to the front the old, enduring, cast-iron
lie about the oppressed and tax-laden serfs who,
in loss happy climes, stagger on their joyless
way under the overwhelming burden of Protec-
tive tariffs. According to the mendacious elec-
tioneering Cobdenite, New South Wales, because
it is cursed by a race of ignorant politicians, who
boast unceasingly about the golden ago of com-
mercial freedom, is, therefore, freer and less
heavily taxed than its southern neighbour, Vic-
toria ; that its citizens are not burdened as in
that hapless land of darkness ; and that, because
duties are not levied on certain articles of import
which are liable to Customs charge-) in Victoian
ports, the population pays less to their Govern-
ment and fives more cheaply in consequence than
the white serfs who know not Parkks. The
ignorant multitude are taught on all hands to
believe that Freetrade means that trade is free,
and few imagine even for a moment that under
the policy, whose very name is a lie wherever it
is practiced, the Customs duties are often heavier
and more burdensome than in lands whore this
gospel has never spread. Yet, according to the
New South Wales revenue returns for 1886, that
land of commercial liberty exacted by means
of Customs duties on imports .£6/ f 000 more
than Victoria levied in inport and ex-
port duties combined, and this year the
Paekes Administration, which obtained office
under the false pretence of liberating commerce,
has reduced this exaction by £57,000 only. At
the present moment the population of the Free-
trade country pays £2 per head in Customs duties,
while the citizens of protected Victoria are
charged to the extent of £2 2s. Cd., and other
forms of taxation bring the account practically to
a level. The actual difference to the peopic
amounts to a few pence per head, and it was on
the strength of one or two paltry coppers that
Pahkes and his faction stumped New Fouth
Wales in a blaze of glory from east,
to west, and from north to south, in favour
of the great .cause which means to them
good bidets and high salaries. Moreover, the
present Freetrade Government receives from land
and other sources millions per annum more
than the Protectionist Ministry of Victoria—in
other words, the men of freedom and light draw
from the people in one shape or another an aver-
age of £8 10s. per head, while the downtrodden
serfs of Victoria are despoiled of £7 only. Free-
trade, so far as it has ever been practised on this
earth, is a living lie, and a sham of the
first magnitude. The difference between
it and Protection merely cons sts in a change
in the position of the inevitable burden ;
the Protectionist adjusts it so that taxation itself
may foster industry ; the Freetrader places it
where it lies like a mighty leaden incubus upon
the shoulders of tbe nation. So long ns the land-
owners are not required to tear the c st of
government, so long will Customs tariffs be neces-
sary, but the policy of the Cobdenites consists in
levying duties upon articles which the country is
unable, from its climate and other conditions, to
produce, so that the burden continues to the end
of Time and produces nothing, while his opponent
prefers to tax articles which the country can
manufacture for itself, in the hope that, while
satisfying the wants of the Treasury, he may-
foster industries, which wdl one day make the
nation rich. No civilised Government, whether
Protectioni-t or Freetrade, has ever levied more
money than its exigencies required, and the effect
on the citizen is the same whether he is taxed
upon the tea which he cannot grow, or upon the
clothes which he can produce for himself if he
tries, in place of sending his scanty funds to sup-
port the labourers of a foreign land. The Pro-
tectionist’s experiment is, of course, liable, under
certain circumstances, to end in failure, bit
should it fail the nation is none the poo er. It
has paid to the • tate not one penny more under
the policy which bade it. worr and hope, than
under tbe boasted system of the political rene-
gade, Parkks, who bids it lie down in the
ditch and wait and depend for its support
on foreign industry. Freetrade taxos/the masses
as heavily as Protection, and its only recommen-
dation is that it offers nothing in return. Its
future is a blank. A Freetrade Government is a
means for raising money—nothing more. At-
tempting nothing, doing nothii g, hoping nothing,
creating nothing, it totters on its imbecile way, a
soulless machine which grinds the nation exceed-
ing small, and leaves no human being one whit
the better or the richer for its selfish existence of
empty boasting and barren lies.

‘ Convened by Obscure Persons ’
That sham Democratic oracle, the Sydney D.T.,
has long boon w ell-known to mediocrity as the
special organ of the unfrocked parson, and the
soulfulness of that dumb ecclesiastical dog shines
out in every line of its somnolent pages. The
other night there was formed in Sydney a branch
of the Australian Land Nationalisation League,
and the CRcesus-like scribe who was despatched
to furnish a report of the affair alluded to the
initial meeting in the columns of this lofty Judas
print, as a demonstration “convened by obscure
persons,” “non-residents of Sydney,” &c. This
comes with peculiarly good grace from a paper,
the early obscurity of which bids fair to be
eclipsed only by the murky Letheian oblivion to-
wards which it is now painfully staggering apaper
which pretends to believe, and with all due rever-
ence be it spoken, in the religious teachings first
promulgated by an obscure carpenter—a paper
which preaches the fiscal doctrine advocated by
an obscure British bagman who Used to drop his
H’s, in which peculiarity he is imitated by that
other fiscal fetich of the D. T.’s, the exponent of
Cobdenism in New South Wales, an obscure
journeyman button-maker from Manchester, ob-
scure Chartist, obscure Kiama-ghost raiser, ob-
scure purple-monkey-on-a-yellow-stick constructor
of Hunter-street, Sydney, in the days before the
D.T. had begun to chant the beauty and holiness
of Protection. This is renegadism with a ven-
geance. It is like conspiracy by a lunatic
against the personal freedom of all sane
people. It is only equalled by those Irish
patriots who land-league in Ireland previous
to becoming land-holders in America or
Australia. But does the D.T.’s bloated Jay
Gould know of any single reform which was not
first advocated by “obscure persons?” Were
not the very people who managed to build up
our present perfect condition of things “obscure
persons ?” How about the present Minister for
Lands, no doubt a very sacred person in the eyes
of the D.T.’s capitalist; was not he an obscure
printer’s devil ? Were not Governor Carington s
paternal ancestors very obscure money-lenders ?
The visiting aristocracy to which the Sydney
daily editor is so fond of salaaming, was it not
fed—is it not being continually fed —by very
obscure-persons? The D.T.’s scribe is weaken
his historical legs. Let us give him a few facts.
The magnificent Sunday-school movement which
the D.T. occasionally twaddles about so
grace'ully ow es its origin to an obscure printer.
The nob ost religion of the East, which now
numbers almost as many followers as the faith of
Jesus, and which is spreading 100 times faster
than Christianity, with all its cost’y missions and
paraphernalia of gilded bishops and auriferous
priests, was founded by an obscure camel-driver
in an obscure corner of Arabia, '1 he freedom of
Switzerland was achieved by an obscure moun-
taineer ; that of Tyrol by an obsure inn-
keeper and cattle-dealer. Tamerlane was a
shepherd, yet, notwithstanding his obscurity, he
conquered Asia and a considerable portion of
Europe. During the ascendancy of Napoleon—
himself the son of an obscure lawyer and Italian
refugee—Sweden was governed by an obscure com-
mon soldier, Naples by an obscure ostler, the son of
an equally obscure innkeeper, Holland and Spain by
the obscure brothers of the obscure Bonaparte
Is it necessary to inform the D.T. that the revolu-
tion it admires so much, that of the a merican
colonies against England, was headed by an
obscure surveyor, assisted by a lot of obscure
farmers and settlers in the character of gene-
rals and statesmen ? Must we point out
that one of America’s most famous men,
ambassador to the politest court of Europe,
was an obscure compositor ? Shall we in-
form the D.T. that it was an obscure marine-
surveyor who had been an obscure apprentice in
an obscure collier-brig who discovered Australia,
while another obscure marine-surveyor, who bore
only the obscure title of midshipman, was the
first to circumnavigate it? Must it be informed
that it was an ob cure ship’s surgeon who dis-
covered Bass’s Strait, while the son of another ob-
scure ship’s surgeon was the man to whom New
South Wales owes its Constitution ? Must we in-
sist that every great movement was initiated by
some obscure persons, for the very simple reason
that the great are not specially “interested” in
bringing about reform ? The great labour party
of America, the Knights of Labour, grew out of
an obscure meeting in an obscure room at which
only seven “obscure persons” were present.
Land Nationalisation itself owes most to an ob-
scure type-setter. The abolition of slavery in
England was mainly the outcome of the efforts
of an obscure scribbling barrister who never held a
brief; in America it was the work of an obscure
abolitionist hanged at Harper’s Ferry, of an
obscure printer who was always having his
obscure house burnt down, of a singularly rugged
and obscure rail-splitter who lived to die his
country’s rule' 1 , of an obscure soldier who was too
brusque to take the trouble of explaining to the
world that he was a great man. But we have
neither space nor patience to continue. It is use-
less explaining that publicans maybe postmasters-
general, or cobblers ministers of mines ; sufficient
is it to state generally that although nearly all
great movements of reform are initiated by
“ obscure persons,” there is small chance for the
D.T.’s scribe ever to emerge from the somnolent
obscurity which settles upon the Sydney King-
street twaddle emporium like thrice-boiled dys-
pepsia on the sotd of a suburban hash-house.

If the old prospectors of Ballarat are inclined for
a real good centenary celebration, a favourable
opportunity presents itself. It has taken them 30
years to erect a dirt mound and a plain, goat-proof
fence on the spot where the diggers fought on the
famous morning of the battle at the Eureka
Stockade, and it is now proposed to erect an old
chimney-pot cannon on top of the heap, said piece
of dismantled artillery not to cost more than £7O.
T herefore, we would suggest that the share-
brokers of the “Corner” should put their clay-
headed spectre of Her Gracious up the spout, and
sell all the rest of the grovel they can
lay their hands upon, and spend the
proceeds in a decent monument. The
dead diggers of the old heroic age would probably
sleep no more peacefully in tbeir neglected graves
for this tribute to their memories, but it would at
least show that Victoria was not altogether
unworthy of ihe sons who fought for her, and
that the soft-goods warriors in ridiculous uniforms
who skirmish among the bread-waggons in many
a hard-blundered autumn manoeuvre, and drink
loyal toasts amid the pomp and circumstance of
glorious dinner-struggles, are not—in their miser-
able subserviency to Imperial traditions—the
representatives of the true public spirit of a great
colony.

The Queen’s statue now occupies its pedestal at
the top of King-street, Sydney. There is a tre-
mendous irony of fate in (his. The spot on which

known to have so tender a regard for poverty and
misery, and whose world-wide sympathy is un-
bounded to the very verge of a “collect” tele-
gram. The “statchu” faces the Insolvency
Court. Possibly this is meant for a piece of
satire on the part of the powers that bo, and is
intended to convey to the sneering mind of the
passing scoffer that the outlook of the Britannia
metal ruler is to bo taken symbolically as she gazes
down on a cleaned-out nation, but we trustfully
pray that this is net so. ’lhe very idea is pro-
fanation. Hitherto the people of New Fouth
Wales have been celebrated for being more loyal
than the ultra-1 cries of Ei gland; more English
than the English themselves. This is because
they were acquainted with the outward aspect of
their sovereign only from the golden and silver
coinage of exchange. But you cannot idealise a
Guelph and preserve the likeness. The sculptor
has done his best, but human ability has its limi-
tations. The “ statchu ”ia moderately idealised,
but it isn’t lovely enough to fix the fickle multi
tude. Henceforth the cause of Primrose League-
isra will steadily decline below the Fahrenheitish
zero. The Sydney Imperialists have made a foolish
move. Still, however, the presence of the brassy
image has its advantages. The toadies and llunkeys
of Sydney will now have something concrete to bow
down before and to spill their young affections
over, and a bronze queen is better than a live
governor. Providence is a long way off—a darned
long way and the alleged Chiistians of Australia
feel the want of a live meat deity to worship, or
failing her in person, a bronze caricature will fill
the bill. In the old English prayer-book—the
edition which is still in use in the Royal chapel
at Windsor, although it is abandoned everywhere
else—the pronouns which refer to her Giacious
are each preceded by a huge piratical-look-
ing capital, whi'e a plain small letter is
held to be good enough for the Holy Trinity, and
we would suggest that this edition should be re-
vived in Sydney for the beselit of loyalists in
general, and Primrose Leaguers in particular.
Alexander the Great claimed to bo the son of
Jupiter, Nero and Caligula demanded divine
honours to ba paid them, Romulus was enrolled
among the gods of Rome, and the heroes of
Greece pretended to a divine origin. There is
precedent enough, therefore, for the new religion
of ViCTORiA-worship, and accordingly we toot the
bugle and welt the big dram under the shadow of
the now statue, and bellow, in company with a
loyal throng, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians.”
We have a suggestion to offer in honour of the
hundredth anniversary of Austra’ia. George
Cruickshank by means of a picture, brought
about the abolition of hanging as a punishment
for tbe crime of passing counterfeit one-pound
notes, and taught the world that a human life
was worth more lhan 20s. sterling. Let some
Australian artist now paint a great realistic pic-
ture of the flogging of Rufus Dawes, as an his-
torical blood-offering in honour of the Centenary,
and we engage to reproduce it in colours, end

A good old chestnut of the N. Z. Legisla-
ture. Hon. W. Rolleston, when Min ster of Lands,
made a barefaced bid for the vote of democratic
F. J. Moss. The latter promised to let him know
in writng in the miming, and when the morning
came the Minister received a letter containing the
line “a Rolleston gathers no Moss.” And this
reminds us t f another good story. Moss was leader •
writer for the N.Z. Herald when Sir George Grey
came from the seclusion of Kawau to liberate from
the rule of “J ho Continuous Ministry,” Wilson,
proprietor of the Herald, though a democrat in
politics, was a good deal mixed up with land-rings,
etc. One night, during the progress of an election
campaign, Grey delivered a stirring speech about
Ministerial rottenness, and, as nn instance, men-
tioned that the Government had recently given a
syndicate of their friends a valuable block at a
tenth of its value. Moss, who was at tbe meeting,
rushed off to his office, and produced a stinging
article against the particular job mentioned by
Grey. Next morning ho met Wilson looking very
glum. “ What’s the matter, sir ? ’ asked Moss,
“ nothing wrong, I hope ?” “ Well, no,” said Wil-
son—“not much—that is to say, I have £5OOO ia
that Syndicate you have slated so badly.”

HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
“ The greater number of overseers in the
colony," wrote a man who was himself in charge
of a chain-gang, “ have been criminals themf
selves, and have neither prudence, honesty, nor
humanity. They are lufflans, who are actuated
and influenced by the worst passions, and fre-
quently flog an unfortunate wretch for complain-
ing of their oppression," These were the gentle
creatures to whose tender mercies the newly-
arrived convict was now handed over. When a
convict had passed through the horrors of the
voyage, and the Inferno of convictlsm in the
colony, and had shown to the satisfaction of his
very competent judges that he had been improved
into the lowest grade of brutality, he was made
an overseer of a chain-gang. By this means the
standard of brutality and barbarism was efficiently
kept up. By an exact analogy, and with a very
slight modification of the principle governing the
same process, we find the traditions of convict
government surviving in the colony to this day,
with a criminal cede which, for sanguinary
brutality, will compare favourably with that of
any other country in the world —with the single
exception, perhaps, of Morocco.
* * *
The labour gangs were drafted away into
the Parramatta or Hawkesbury districts, and
set to work in the fields like the beasts of the
same. The political prisoner,.Holt, has a note of
something he saw on entering one of these culti-
vation-paddocks f first time. The Reverend
Mr. Marsden—we must deal with this worthy
presently—Mr. Atkins—the Judge-Advocate, who
also claims a place in the story—Captain John-
stone and Dr. Thompson were with him. “We
proceeded to a Government settlement. At a dis-
tance I saw about fifty men at work, as I thought,
dressed in nankeen jackets, but, on nearer ap-
proach, I found them naked, except fora pair of loose
trousers. Their skin was tanned by the sun and
climate to that colour. I felt much pity for the
poor wretches.” A little conversation ensued,
which is worth recording—
Captain Johnstone addressed me, saying,
• Mr. Holt, you are a*good farmer, I suppose ?'
‘ I do well enough with horses and oxen, but
not with men,’ said I.
Dr. Thompson then said. Do yon not think
these men would understand you better than
horses or oxen 1’
• Yes, sir,’ I replied, ‘ but it appears great
brutality to work men in this manner.’
‘ Well,’ said he, * it matters not what you think
about it, you will scon come into it.’
The humane doctor, it will be seen, had the
profoundest confidence in the brutalising effects of
the system on all who were brought'into contact
with its operation. And he was right.
* * •
The’soil of Parramatta and its vicinity is
scored as deeply by convict labour as ever the
backs of the convicts were excoriated by the lash.
Every hill, probably, has seen its whipping-post,
and every field has been watered by convict
blood. The gallows on Constitution Hill stretched
its black, gaunt arm like a grisly rceptre over the
land, claiming everything in view by the right of
exclusive possession. To this day the ghost of
dead and buried convictism broods over the dis-
trict which bears a repute in old colonial history
not second either to that of Port Arthur or Nor-
folk Island. Horrible stories of convict murders,
of men flogged to death, of convicts at the
triangles and on the gallows, hang like dead-
weights on this chapter of our miserable colonial
story.
The Government regulation set apart a
certain quantity of work to be done in a given
time. The persons to whom convicts were as-
signed gave this out to their white labour by the
day, week, or month. The convict was to be paid
a certain price for all the work he did beyond the
stipulated quantity. Each man cost his employer
12s. per week, for rations, lodging, and such
clothing as he had. If any were idle, and did
not do the regulated quantity of work, “ it was
only necessary to take them before a magistrate,”
says a writer of the time, “and he would order
them 25 lashes of tbe oat on their backs
for the first offence, 50 for the second, and
so on ; and if that would not doin some
cases it did not do, because the slave-driver was
so anxious to get some return for his 12s. per
week that he compelled his victims to w ork while
their wounds were still gaping—“ they were at
last put into a gaol-gang, and made to work in
irons from morning till night." There are some
instances given when an occasional holder of convict
labour treated his men with a certain tolerance.
These cases were few, and happy was the con-
vict who could get into such a service. “ Most
of them," we are told, “ by finding out that
honesty was the best policy, became sincerely
honest and well-conducted, and lived and died
valuable members of society. So much does
gentle and mild treatment win upon the minds of
men, while harsh severity and coarcion hardens
their hearts, and brutalises their characters.”
But the gaolers of these men and the ofliclals
of the settlement cared very little about
these moral observatiots. It was not to their
interest to see their victims become valuable
members of society. That interfered with the
dishonest fortunes these officers were making. It
was to their Interest that the unhappy convict
should be remorselessly and hopelessly ground
down. It was on this view that they consistently
acted.
* * *
The magistrates were in collusion with
the officers, and the judges with tbe magistrates.
Judge Dore was nearly always drunk, and Judge-
Advocate Atkins, who relieved him, was more
drunk still. But this only sharpened their ap-
petite for blood. In Governor Bligh’s report on
the colony he expressly mentions that Judge-
Advocate Richard Atkins had repeatedly pro-
nounced sentence of death in moments of intoxi-
cation. Mann, who has written about the early
days, writes this with a running pen, as it were :
“As instances of the Irregularities [this word is
Machiavellian] that have been practised by some
of those in magisterial capacities, I meed repeat
none others than that I have known men without
trial to be sentenced to transportation by a single
magistrate at his own barrack; and free men,
after having been acquitted by a court of criminal
judicature, to be banished to one or other of the
dependent settlements { and I have heard a magis-
trate tell a prisoner who was then being examined
for a capital offenc •>, and hal some things on him
supposed to be stolen, that were he not going to
be banged so soon, he (the magistrate) would be
d—-d if he would not make him say from whence
he got them ; nor do I believe it less true that
records of an examination, wherein a respectable
young man was innocently engaged, have been
destroyed by the eame magistrate before whom
the depositions were taken.” Io need only be
added to this that transportation meant hard
labour, often for life, in the coal-mines of New-
castle, or banishment to Norfolk Idaid.
* * *
Judge Atkins was not popular, strat ge to
say. He could sentence men to flogging or trans-
portation with a hiccup, and cock the black cap
over his eye with a leery air as he pronounced the
last sentence of the law in what Bligh euphuisti-
cally called his “ moments ” of intoxication—and
yet they did not love him 1 These accomplish-
ments, and the genially sociable qualities of this
drunken Draco palled on their jaded fppeti'es.
So they excogitated a little plot. Unfortunately,
perhaps, it failed in its execution, and the plotters
were arrested. Judge Atkins adjudicated, and
this is what took place :
Question : “ Did you hear the prisoner say all
this ? ”
Witness : “ No; I only heard him say that he
would flog the Judge to death.
Judge Atkins : “Did he say for what reason
he would flog me to death 1 ”
Witness : “ Because, sir, you had ordered
men to be flogged, and they had died from the
flogging,”
And yet the Judge was not popular—except, in-
deed, amongst the class which admired his firm
and uncompromising administration of the law.
Colonial history is always repeating itself, and
this opportunity has not been missed.
* • •
“ The more convicts that can be made
over to individuals, and taken off the stores, the
greater will be the advantage,” said a Whitehall
despatch of 1796. The principle thus laid down
was carried out in a very thorough-paced fashion.
The labourers worked from five in the
morning till eleven, and from two in
the afternoon to sunset. The Governor in
1800, wrote thus “ Notwithstanding the
number of people brought from Ireland by the last
two ships ’’—this was just after the rebellion
“we have received no great accumulation of
The Majesty of the law—rather the worse for
liquor.
strength. Many of the prisoners have been either
bred up in genteel or professions, unaccus-
tomed to hard labour. These are a dead-weight
on the public stores.’ ’ Barrington’s history, re-
ferring to these men, says : “ Notwithstanding the
detestation of the crimes many of them are trans-
ported for, yet it was not possible f r the Go-
vernor to send a physician, the once sheriff of a
county, a Catholic priest, or a Protestant clergy-
man and family to the brick-carts, brick-fields,
grubblng-hoe, or the timber-carriage. The lower
class of convicts in these cargoes were mostly old
men, fit only for hut-keepers, to remain at home
and prevent robbery while the other inhabitants
of the hut were at labour, thus making good the
old proverb, ‘ Set a thief to catch a thief.’ ”
* • •
Each officer had 10 assigned servants.
A letter to the Duke of Portland contains a state-
ment that assigned servants “ were allotted to
the service of convict nrostitute wom°n.” In the
service of private masters convicts received such
bad treatment that the Government resented this
interference with its privileges, and an order was
issued to the effect that “ If any person should
beat or use their (sic) servants ill they will be
taken from them to Government labour, and the
offender dealt with according to their situations
in the colony.” But if any convict attempted to
work for himself while at assigned service, with a
view to improving his condition by and-bye, he
received the reward of his Industry in the shape
of 100 lashes and 12 months in gaol. That
stopped him for the time. “ Magistrates,’
we read, “ would oblige one another as
employers in authorising the removal of ob-
noxious servants, or by Inflicting lashes for
supposed disobedience of orders —an elastic charge
by which the poor fellow lost the benefit of his
fixity of tenure." Many men were kept In a state
of servitude long after the expiration of their sen-
tences. It was not until 1797 that the Secretary
of State promised that “ in future lists shall be
sent from England and Ireland of the terms of
sentence.” For the first two years not an item of
Information on this subject was despatched with
the transports, and only Irregularly afterwards.
The fact proves rather conclusively that the
Government in England had little thought of its
outcasts as soon as it got them off its hands.

Perhaps the most painful thing in connec-
tion with this part of our history is the manner in
which Australian writers have dealt with it. The
fortunes that were made by the oppression and
cruelty of these early days have been worshipped,
and the deeds of the men who made them glozed
over. The unhappy wretches who became ihelr
victims are passed over without a word of pity for
their sufferings, or of reprobation for the conduct
of those who caused them. Yet no class of men
ever called more strongly for reprobation. “It
would have been far more merciful,” sajs an eje-
wltness of what he describes, “ to have hanged all
who violated the laws of their country, than to
have sent them out to New South Wales and its
dependencies, subject to the unmerciful treatment
of human tigers, who tortured or killed those
within their power according to the caprice of the
moment. I saw many a fine man die in misery,
inch by inch, from the oppression ho experienced
—the most cruel of all deaths." All this, and
more also —It is almost impossible to realise it 1—
took place during year after year in sunny New
South Wales I
The Coming Queensland Elections
The elections in Queensland promise to result in
a snrprise. Almost all elections are a surprise,
and these will be so especially. A few years ago,
Griffith went in on the r»emocratic and retrench-
ment racket, while MTlwraith posed as the
Conservative successor of the “ Old Tory” party
and Palmer. He ran the country in the boom,
merrily and wastefully. Griffith came in with
the drought ard ran it more wastefully still.
M Ilwraith legislated for the squatters. Griffith
was backed by Groom and the Darling Downs
selectors. The present Queensland Parliament
has run its full course, and it has done lh tie, save
break its pledges and play the devil with general
administration 1 And now, on the eve of a disso-
lution, Griffith, fallen into the sere and yellow
leaf, makes desperate bids for a return to power.
* * *
From the beginning of his political career. Sir
Thomas MTlwraith has been a consistent Pro-
tectionist, and has been waiting his time. He
said once, jears ago, that he felt it was utterly
useless at that time to advocate Protection. He
would not have found four followers in the House.
The tariff question excited no interest. The colony
was prosperous, and had an Incalculable future
before it. The great cry was for emigrants.
To day all the large coast-towns see swarms of
unemployed mechanics and labourers watching,
with moody despair, the long train of English,
Scotch, and Irish, who poured off from the huge,
subsidized, B I. emigrant ships. The country no
longer subsists on raw material. Queenslanders
no longer are mere resident agents for London
importers. A civilised community, with all its
complex conditions and complex demands, rises to
its feet. MTlwraith would find more than four
men in the House to-day to vote for the national
cause, and the country is weary of Freetrade and
Griffith.
* * *
Griffith, for a great part of his political
career, has been an equally consistent Freetrader.
The Brisbane paper, of which he is part pro-
prietor, and whose policy he dictates, is
run by two Anglo - Australian ex - parsons
of the most virulent Freetrade, “ unlimited com-
petition, within and without,” species. One of
these is also Griffith’s Legislative Council
nominee. When Griffith went home to Eng-
land, at the end of the last session, he had just
begun to be anxious about the elections. His
overwhelming majorities were still unbroken, but
on all sides were signs of discontent. The North
was, of course, bitterly hostile throughout. The
Duttonian Land Bill was a frightful failure. Dut-
ton is a squatter with an amateurish “ sympathy”
with Democratic land aspirations. He used to
quote Henry George, but he never understood
him. Democrats must never forget that the devil
can quote Scripture, and the landowners and
capitalists can distort even Karl Marx or
Henry George to suit their purpo e. The Bill
constructed by this fair-weather Democrat was at
once a fraud and an absurdity, although the Bris-
bane Courier professed to read Henry George's
theories between the lines to the end. Tae capi-
talists of Brisbane did their best to raise the
“ Socialism bogey,” and to frighten the masses.
But the Bill failed on its own demerits. No one
took any notice of it. Ic was born dead. Thus
the “ Darling Downs Democracy ” lost confidence,
and Groom began to get ready once more to
“ turn dog ’ upon his ch’ef.
• *■ *
Griffith himself had never made a personal
friend. His contempt for his colleagues has not
only been shown everywhere, bub often actually
expressed. His temper was souring. The serene
Sam whom no one could “draw" began to be
irritable. He was burning the candle at both
ends. To keep up a large practice at the Bar,
boss a Government, and be a prodigy of minute
Inspection in each public D apartment was telling on
him. On the top of this he went home.
* * *
“I think,” said Service, in Hobart, at the
Federal Council, “ the minds of all the members
of the Council, and the minds of all the colonies
in the Federation, will turn with one accord to the
central figure." The “central figure" was
Griffith, but it was his last appearance in that
character. Bub he was full of confidence then.
“ I, however, 1 ’ he said. “ am able to look forward
to continuing a member of the Council —for the
present at all events.” Sam was exuberant in
these days, and was still untainted by British
political corrupt ion. He said : “ I do not think
that it is in accordance with the spirit of the times
in these colonies, that we should contribute to the
revenue of Great Britain by a distinct money
payment And now—see how it has all changed.
* * *
In London be successfully “ did for” Separation
He quoted his overwhelming majority—the whole
House against nine ; but he did not state that,
with the exception of his own Attorney-General, ex-
parson Routledge, every representative of the
North was included in thatnine. In London he suc-
cessfully posed as the Queensland dictator, and
grovelled to Salisbury in consideration of his
acknowledging this. Salisbury, in return, ex-
torted an assent to Imperial Federationism, and
Griffith “ pledged the country," as he says, to
that very “distinct money-p ayment ” for naval
defence which he has so often and so lately im-
pugned. Salisbury taught him something else,
too, and let him into a secret. The British Con-
servatives were once more going to “dish” the
Liberals by sprlngit g Protection upon them as a
Democratic cry. Griffith returned home deter-
mined that he would not he “dished” in this way
—nay, that he would “ dish " MTlwraith, who
is returning to political life, and make a further
Democratic appeal still, if necessary, by proposing
a land-tax.
* * *
When he came back he found things worse than
he expected. His great whipper-in, Bulcock,
the soi-disant Schnadhorst of Liberal Queens-
land, told him that the whole camp was in revolt.
Griffith at once sprung his mine. He spoke
openly of Protection and of a land-tax. HD
squatting pseudo-democrats answered with their
heels. Dickson, the only man of brains in his
Ministry, resigned the Treasury. Dickson Is an
auctioneer, and his clients are squatters, and all
squatters know that a land-tax is a crime, and
they would die rather than patronise a member of
a Government that advocated it. Macdonald
Patterson, a lawyer, for similar reasons followed
suit. Griffith did not waver. He mooted his
tax proposals ; was defeated, and signified his in-
tention of going back on all bis past record and
appealing to the country on the stolen platform of
Protection, coupled with a land-tax with which
he hoped to propitiate the long-forgotten Demo-
cracy.
t * ♦
The Protectionists, however, decline to follow
him. Sir Thomas MTlwraith is, more than
ever, their natural leader since he has consented
to sink his views with regard to coloured labour,
and they distrusted Griffith's eleventh-hour
conversion, and refnsed to take the battered,
worn-out idol of the Freetrade party for their
divinity. The ma°ses, who once looked on Grif-
fith as their chief, have been alienated by a Imp-
course of treachery ard blundering. The
“Liberal” Premier has a mania for drawirg-up
bills—he took about 16 of them on one of his tours
that he might draft clauses and regulations as be
went along—and he has hampered every industiy
by a thousand paltry rf strict ions. A swarm of
kanaka inspectors and officials of all descriptions
have harassed the Northern planters into utter
ruin; the pearl-fishers 1 ave been swamped with a
multitude of b; e laws and petty dieabill ies ; and.
finding that the country had grown weary of
empty law-making, and of empty lawyers,
whose one great boast it was that they
passed more Acts in a given time than
any previous Government, he resolved to at
least ensure that his opponents should have
no such lease of power as he has himself enjoyed.
Hence the introduction by a defeated Government
that had already made its appeal to the country,
and only retained office to pass the Estimates—
hence the impudent introduction of a Triennial
Bill that would revolutionise political procedure
in Queensland ! Add to this an attempt by such
a Government to foist on the country a “ distinct
money payment ’’ for naval “Imperialistic" de-
fence, denounced by this Griffith in person only
a year ago, and even the lawyers and parsons who
made him what he is, must admit that (saving
always Sir Henry Pabkes) Sir Samuel Griffith
must take the cake for political cheek, “ naked
and not ashamed.”
• « •
The election will be a surprise. No on© really
knows the state of the constituencies. So many
forces are at work there, and Protection is not the
least of them. There are signs of a rudimentary
“ Labour Party,” after the model of the American.
One thing is certain: The tariff question will be
mooted, and energetically mooted. Now is the
time for Protectionists to draw together and or-
ganise. Capital runs the Daily Press, and in
Queensland as in New South Wales Democracy
and Protection are unrepresented.

Pta’myell Griffith la building a gorgeous

charge will feel much relieved when they see the
financial vacuum removed to more commodious
premises.
Even a large and flourishing business in
schrapps, with sundry £1 orders enclosed in each
day’s output, has its drawbacks. A large section
of the community don’t know a £1 order when
they see it, and, consequently, Messrs. Wolfe and
Sons issued a number of these cheques marked
“ specimen copy.” This has opened a new field
of usefulness to some one who wants to be lagged,
and the words in question having been removed
with acid he is now going round trying to collect
about £lOOO or so from the company. So far, It la
satisfactory to know that he hasn’t got it.

The convalescent Brough wi'l shortly take
up his old role of Jonathan Wild, at Sydney
Ciiterion, which is a cause for congratulation, as
Mr. Brown has been steadily deteriorating. Dur-
ing the last week he has infused too much of the
silent unassuming chump into the character,
while those characteristics in Jonathan’s reputa-
tion which unfitted him for keeping a pig have
been a good deal overlooked. The rjcent Wild
was not a man who went about uttering heavy
truths, as reputable eye-witnesses, who were
on intimate terms with the deceased, and
who have no desire to blacken his charac-
ter are prepared to testify upon affidavit
before any respectable justice of the peace. At
the Gaiety, “ The World Against Her” is doing
its third week, and “Faust” is in preparation.
A new and reliable perdition is being constructed
under the stage for that gentleman to drop into,
and every precaution will be taken to prevent the
lost souls getting out when the lid is taken off.
Any who should escape will be seized and thrown
in again before they have time to molest the
audience.

Frank Clark’s clever variety show is still
fin command at the Sydney Opera House with a
■slightly varied programme, and the fun goes fast
and furious. The “great four” do the same
ancient business, and indulge in labial elongation
-over the same white-headed decrepit gags, and
the audience grins in Christian unison. Then
follow the “Dummies” with their concentrated
impertinence to the counterfeit presentment of El
Maestro Allpress, and his demoniac fiddle.
Mademoiselle Garretta continues to charm
the audience with her bevy of performing pigeons,
and Wilson and Cameron stand on their india-
rubber heads as of yore. The whole show, as in
the snowy-craniumed past, ihen glides through
itself in the person of Miss May Cameron, gets its
legs and its arms bewilderlngly mixed up, and
manages to evolve order from chaos by a brain-
splitting complication of supernatural wriggles.
Next, Messrs. Field and Hanson play fantastic
tricks with every variety of musical instruments,
from a deal table to a jam-tin, and the whole
affair leaps into space from a trapeze in the
agile personality of Ouda.

A Yankee criticism of Mrs. Langtry’s
acting in her death scene of “As in a Looking-
Glass ” :
Her contortions here warrant the inference that she has
taken a water-melon, rather than chloral. She hops about
from chair to chair, with her bands upon the pit of her
stomach, like a small boy who has partaken too freely of
green apples; drops upon a sofa and tears the plush with her
teeth; gallops three or four times around the room calling
for Algy; and th-n falls over a trick-chair that comes down
like a combination bed, and expires just as Algy rushes in to
stand over her with one arm stretched out at an angle of 90
degrees, and the other at 70 degrees, thus completing what
the programme says is an “ affecting tableau.”

Hugo’s Buffalo Minstrels are prospering

(N.Z.), a local paper, which hadn't received an

everybody who paid for a front seat while his bills

Bland Holt is his own Judas and carries Ihs bag.
It has grown so heavy in N.Z, that he has quite a

in Melbourne many years ago she had a blear-
eyed poodle of vicious habits, and the dawg ate
part of a dramatic critic in Collins-street. He
tried to brain the animal with his gamp, but Alice
saved it from destruction. That was long, long
ago, but the critic slated "her for it to the day
of her death. In a Queensland town, the other
day a gay and fresh reporter came to act as escort

Opera Company. Jimmy Macmahon threw him
out, and then he came in again, and biffed Joe
Maomahon on the “ bugle.” Joe also threw him
out, and he now writes that the ladies of the
company are all over 50. When, at Sydney
Royal, the other night, the faithful poodle came
on dressed for a journey—in tall hat, gamp, and
coat —a fair and dtcoli-ttee damsel didn’t recognise
the Intelligent beast, and said to her companion,
“ Oh, Charlie ! here’s Sir Henry Parkes.”
Dear Bulletin, —In your last issue 1
notice a paragraph under “ Personal Items,”
about poor old Father Tim M'Carthy, where it
appears that the genial and beloved priest was in
his cups. Permit me to correct this statement.
It was at the time of the Pope’s death that Father
Tim was selected to dilate upon his goodness, his
sermon being duly edited by Archbishop Vaughan.
When the Father appeared in the pulpit, how-
ever, instead of speaking on the subieot In ques-
tion, he cursed the Archbishop in such a discourse
as that venerated priest had never heard before.
Dr. Vaughan sent one of the boys who swing the
incense to tell Father Tim to stop, but he replied
audibly, “ I won’t stop, and you can send as many
boys as you like to me." The fact was that the
genial and charitable old man was mad. Some
time before this he had been eccentric, but this
seems to have been his end. Subsequently, as
you say, he was sent home never to return.
Yours, Soltcitus.
The latest news regarding the widows for
whom the Bull! Fund was so liberally subscribed
is that the first quarter's miserable allowance is
overdue and remains unpaid. Meanwhile the
Wallsend miners have resolved to guarantee £3OO
for the prosecution of claims against the Bull!
Company. Possibly there is a connection between
these two circumstances.
The long-talked off “mounted sword con-
test ” came off at Bondi Aquarium on Saturday in
the presence of a large and hypochondriac crowd.
The two combatants, Captain Jennings, who lays
claim to the “championship of the world”—
almost everybody is champion of something now-
adays, and N.S.W. comes to the front with the
champion dirt eater if it can t do anything else—
and Sergeant Donovan, appeared in leathern
armour, and straightway began to whack at each
other. Each touch on head, arms, or body
counted a point, and there was little scope
for scientific walloping—whenever one com-
batant got near enough to the other
he solemnly clouted him and went back to his
corner. Sometimes one would stop with his
sword held straight out in front of him, and wait
for his foe to fall against it; sometimes they both
rushed at each other and spanked each other on
the brains; occasionally one would miss his enemy
and, while tearing pasthim, would hear his foe's ar-
tillery come down on his back, Donovan, especially,
getting it very warm on the hinder part; and
every few minutes one or other would remain
in the air for a moment and then come
down on the verdure with a concussion and
smother a groan. The combatants came down
a good deal of toner than they got up again,
and they came down very fast and got up very
slowly. The rules of the contest prohibited either
warrior from hitting a man when he was down,
and, as the grass was cool and grateful to the part
of the soldier that he hit it with, the fallen hero
would lie for a minute, and ask himself where he
had got to. Latterly, however, the ground began
to get bard throegh being hit eo much, and then
the contest was brought to a close. Jennings—a
veteran of the France-German war —would prob-
ably have won and retained the championship under
ordinary circumstances, but ho was weak from
fever and went down easily, and Donovan, who
was considerably smashed up in the Crimea, came
off best by seven whacks against six. The
stakes were £5O a-side, with £250 added by the
Bondi Aquarium Company. Larry Foley after-
wards offered £125 in prizes for a series of contests,
and Donovan was backed to the extent of £lOO for
another fight wi.h Jennings, so that the comba-
tants will shortly be knocked about some more.
The point of the following, cat from an
English paper, lies in the Australian application
thereof : —
I want to trace the revival of public interest in prize-
fighting, to show what it all amounts to. Jem Smith calls
himsslf Champion of England. In a communication he was
kind enough to allow to be published a few weeks ago, he
admitted that for sparring on music-hall stages and places of
public amusement, he was in receipt of a salary of £6O a
week. He is the best-made man I ever saw, and his enter-
tainment is graceful, scientific, and well worth seeing. The
reason why he is Champion of England—an empty title—is
that no one disputes his right to call himself so, or anything
else he chooses; in fact, I can see no objection if he styles
himself Archbishop of England, and provided that
thereby he induces people to pay t) see his show,
he is surely justified in the harmless advertisement. But
it was natural that Jem Smith should not be allowed
the whole field to himself. When Irving became a success,
Wilson Barrett cropped up ; so soon as Mrs. Langtry suc-
ceeded Mrs. Brown-Potter adopted the stage as a profes-
sion. After the champion pugilist of England proved a
draw at the music-halls, Mr. ” Pony ” Moore, of the Moore
and Burgess Mins’-.rels, went to America, aud found an op-
position champion to Jem Smith. It is to this state of things
that we are indebted for the privilege of welcoming Jake
Kilrain amongst us. While Smith is exhibiting and draw-
ing in the shillings at the Aquarium, Kilrain is exhibiting
and drawing in the dollars at St. James's Hall. While
Smith's friends are drinking and swaggering at one bar,
Kilrain’s friends are drinking and bragging at another bar.
Bo far, there is a legitimate trade com petition, and as most
people interested in boxing will go to both entertainments,
each competitor is indebte Ito the other for so much adver-
tisement. A match has been made, ostensibly for a thou-
sand pounds aside and the Championship of the World.
Smith and Kilrain are to meet somewhere and sometime
under the old prize-ring rules, and fight for the title and
the money and also for the possession of a diamond belt
presented by the enterprising editor of a low American
Journal. It has been pretty generally circulated that the
fight will take place in Spain—the locality where we build
our imaginary castles—and all sorts of rumours are abroad
as to each man’s capabilities to beat the other. I have even
heard of some betting on the match. Now, to my mind, it is
pretty clear that this is all rubbish. Smith and Kilrain will
never fight in Spain or elsewhere, and for a very obvious rea-
son. So long as Smith calls himself Champion, people will
pay to see him spar, and he will continue to earn his £6O a
week. So long as Kilrain is matched to fight the Champion,
and professes his ability to beat him, people will pay to see
him spar, and compare his style and form with that of the
Champion. If Smith beats Kilrain, all is up with the
latter’s shilling-getting capacity; if Kilrain beats Smith,
down goes the latter, and his means of livelihood have
departed, tinder the circumstances, to imagine that these
men are going to risk so much for nothing at all, is to
I imagine that they are both fools thirsting for gore. Bosh !
They are both showmen, and very clever showmen, too.
If these men were foolish enough to want to fight, there are
dozens of country gentlemen who would find them a safe and
suitable place of combat in their private grounds, where
there would be no chance of police intervention. 1 heard a
well-known nobleman make an offer of such a one to Jem
Smith’s manager on Thursday. It was not accepted. A
Bataille en Espagne is the long and short of it. Kilrain
exhibits, wherever he goes, the diamond belt, which is sup-
posed to be fought for. This Smith objects to. Being a
part of the stake, he contends it should be deposited with
the stakeholder. But Smith is wrong. The bait need not be
relinquished until the fight is about to begin. As this will
probably be never in this country, Kilrain will take it home
with him when the excitement of his presence here has died
out, and when the ruffians and rioters who have come to the
surface owing to the current craze, have found their way
back again to Birmingham. Whitechapel, and the Dials.
At Princess Theatre, Melbourne, they are playing j
“ Ermlm'e ”
(Suit the accent to the rhythm) and the thing ap-
pears to gee;
As opera or comedy but little claim has it
To rank among the miracles of melody or wit.
But, better than the pieces which a culchawed bard
admires.
Are those other master-pieces that the treasurer
requires;
So, what’s the use of saying that Emmie's poor
and thin.
If it tempts the eager multitudes to dissipate their
tin ?
This show is kept agoing by a funny pair of lags,
Who dress in garments snavelled from a viscount’s
carpet bags;
They masquerade as barons and bewitch the titled
tarts —
But there's precious little funniness in any other
parts
Composer Jaoobowski is a melancholy Pole,
With mem'rles of contemporary music in his
soul;
Yet, Instead of leaving airs in their entirety
alone,
He mixes ’em together with some rubbish of his
own.
So, in this comic opera (a very common thing).
It generally happens we are saddest when they
sing ;
But if the ballads bore us, and the situation drags,
The show is kept agoing by a funny pair of lags.
Some minor bits of business smart management
betray—
Lovers enter, sing, and exit in a human kind of
way;
The ladles of the chorns, too, are anything but
hags,
And the show is kept agoing by a funny pair of
lags.
Miss Leonora Braham, and the tenor-voiced
L’umane,
Struggle bravely with their troubles, though the
struggle is in vain ;
Maggie Moore’s as good as ever, but she’s not
about for long;
While massive Alice Barnett doesn’t favour with
a song.
Clever folks like Johnny Wallace, Ida Osborne,
and a lot
Of others take their cues, but never get upon the
spot;
They haven't any music and they haven't any
goes;
But the show is kept agoing by a funny pair of
lags.
Then, hey! for Billy Elton and for Howard Ver-
non, too,
Who clutch this comic opera and fairly pull it
through;
So nimble in their naughtiness—in wickedness
such wags—
That show would fall to pieces if it wasn't for the
lags.
Only a Sod.
“ A party of Irish immigrants arrived at
a Melbourne wharf the other day. The first thing
one of them, a young man, did was to open his
box and take out a hard-baked sod which he gave
to an old woman (evidently the mother of some of
them), who received them on the wharf. She
kissed it and ‘ blessed herself.’ It was part and
parcel of the grand ould sod to which her heart-
strings clung.’’—Melbourne Newspaper.
It’s only a sod, but ’twill break me ould heart
Nigh hardened wid toilin’ and carin’,
And make the ould wounds in it tingle and smart.
It’s only a sod, but it’s parcel and part
Of strugglin’, sufferin’ Erin.
It’s only a sod, but it rakes the ould pain—
The ould love in me heart that still lingers,
That Time has been soothing and docth’ring in
vain;
And now he must soothe it and heal it again
Wid his kindly and gentle ould fingers.
It's only a god, but I see a big ship
Through the gallopin’ waters come tearln’,
And a lass that looks back on the horizon dip,
Wid eyes full of tears and a thrimblin’ lip,
On the last that she saw of ould Brin.
It’s only a sod, but wid care it will keep
Till me brooms and me brushes are silint—
Pat it into me arms ere they bury me deep,
And tell them old Biddy the “ slavey ” does sleep
'Neath a sod from the bogs of ould Irlint.

There is a boss-eyed Chinaman who runs
a ham-and-beef shop in an up-countey town, and
fills in his time by leading a wild, wild life In the
vegetable business, Assisted by a deputy Chow,
he vends the crinkly cabbagce intbee*rly morn-
ing, also the olenge and the Etlawbeliy in their
season, and then all day he supplies ham and eggs
to the public, and at night he sleeps under the
counter. His next reighbour was, until recently,
a Scotch publican, and the other night the latter
gentleman came in in an excited condition and de-
manded supper. Somehow, there cane about a
disagreement between the pair, which culminated
in the foreigner saying : “ Publican man a'n’t no
good,” and then the hotelkeeper went to work
and wrecked the establishment, and left frag-
ments of pigtail, ham, fractmci eggs, ard beef
visible on the horizon, while the assaulted shop
keeper boo-hooed in Chinese sealed on the ruins
of the premises. But he gathered himself up and
had a long and artistic revenge. First he eued
the hotelkeeper for the value cf the «mash, and
added on a bottle of Chinese medicine, pries
£3 10s., which he swore the publican had
poured down his back. Then he loafed
about at night and poisoned the publi-
can’s dog, and when the beer-sel!er threw the
corpse into his shop, he complained to the
police. Nobody ever knew how it was that the
dead deg was afterwards found flrating in a cask
of beer in the hotel cellar, but there it certainly
was, and at the very moment when the dripping
carcase was brought upstairs by the tail a Chinese
face looked in at the bar with an unfa’ homable
Chinese smile, and a hated voice asked mildly,
“Publican fellow whisky man, him wantee any
good pie ?” Then there
was a rather nice-looking
Bridget in the hotel
kitchen, with whom the
publican had long con-
templated matrimony,
but just as he bad made
up his mind to the act,
she eloped with the vin-
dictive Chinaman and
swore to love and honour
his yellow carcase for
evermore. There were
great rejoicings at the
wedding, and somebody
threw a 200 skunk power
stinkpot through the
hotel window and made
the bar smell like 1000
poleca's for a week
afterwards. The publi-
can sallied out and cap-
tured a Chow, whom he
thought to be the off nd-
er. “11l teach ye to
throw yer foreign inven-
tions into ma hoose, ye
miserable caterwaulin’
vagabone I’’ he said,
sternly, and he was as
good as his word, for he
held the Asiatic under
the pump and pumped on
him for a quarter of an
hour. He felt batter after
this, but his satisfaction
died away next morning,
when ho found his horse
painted bright green, and
hisnewdogcf a sky-blue
tint. He washed the
horse and the dog, and
offered a reward for th a
capture of the wretch
who was responsible, and
the very next day the
dog re appeared in start-
ling yelio v colours This
finished l im. He, felt that the enemy was too
numerous and too persist eat, and he sold out his
business and left, A few sympathising friends
escorted him (o the coach, and bade him farewell,
but the other passengers struck on account of the
odour of that Chinese stink-pot, which still clung
to his clothes, and he had to get out and walk.

Ont in the colonial wilds the debt-collector

treats the subject all round with the stern (m-

Mr. B is, but it points out distinctly that he

This is a story of blighted hopes, dashed
affections, frozen-toed misery, anguish, and dark,
moaning, cavernous despair. It is a tale cf the
horrors ot real life, and the grim facts on which
it is built transpired only last week in a small,
bucolic Victorian township. The Mogul of that
turnip-rearing hamlet is a fat, bulgy man who
runs a flour-mill and wallows in family pride—
his ancestors, we believe, mashed carrots for the
Conqueror—and he is possessed of a pretty
daughter and enough money to fill a tank. The
young ltdy, on the other hand, is plim and
ethereal—a pensive, dinging creature, with a big
dark eye and a moat.tain torrent of gush, a-.d eho
has read enough London Journals and yellow-
backed novels, filled with dqkes who brush their
hair in boudoirs with two golden-backed brushes,
to block a street. She is soaked with sentiment
and reeking with romance, and every time a high-
collared dude coims along who starches his mous-
tache and curls his balr with abet nail, and wears
an atmospbe e cf langour, “ haw,” and sucked
walking cane, she pours out at his feet the
wealth of her fresh young hta t. She has
been taken in again ard again by harbors,
French cooks, and young men in the ribbon
department, bat the prosy oil parent has cub up
rough every time. Ha hi» resolved that she shall
marry a solid end weal hy person whose front
name is Hezekiah.and he dedicaes h's-llfe to cast-
ing the gloom cf a club over the gay young men
who have an eye on his daughter and his cash,
and bruises their tendered feelings with a bit cf a
stick These are rough tier es for both him and
the girl. Late at night she rehearses Romeo and
Jul et at the window, and then he wakes at her
impassioned accents and pokes about in the gloom
of the garden with a log in search of the other
fe'low. But some three months ago a freshyoung
man took cha T ge of the local post and telegraph
tfflee. He was tall and willowy, grew a perfect
love of a moustache, and was just too elegant for
anything. He met the miller's daughter— it was
a case of mutual irretrievable mash on first sight,
and they met again too numerous to mention, and
at last. In a moment of blissful enthus'asm, the
lovers planned an elocement. No ordinary, vul-
gar flitting would suit the gushing lady—she in-
tended to flee in slyle, by the light of the mcon,
via a knotted rope, and to have a carriage wait-
ing a diuggcd dog, apathetic letter, and all the
accessories and lime-light effect s peculiar to a
recherche ikedaddle. Dre arrangements were
made, and the night of the ship arrived. The plans
and specifications cf the flit reflected credit upon
the designer, and all would have passed off wiih
eclat, doubtless, had not Romeo made one
little slip—the hot-blooded youth turned up drunk,
firmly but gently drunk ; and, not content with
te'ng drunk, he took a bottle with h : m Promptly
at the call of time, the flour-miller’s only chi d
threw up her chamber-window, and let out a rope

she sneaked down stairs, and slipped out by the

of the onslaught, the fair flitter, who was hanging
on to the rope, uttered a loud, long wail and let
go her grip ; but, her clothes catching on a spike
in the wall, she hung suspended, screaming. The
lover continued to bang the door, and enthu-
siastically demand his daisy and his heart’s
delight; and, in response to his appeals, the
miller presently appeared armed with a larg ■> jug
Just then a serving man came hurrying around
b e house, accompanied by a rake and a deg, and
followed by the female servant'*. Then the
battle began ; the miller, the man-servant, the
maidservant, and the deg all went for Romeo, and
tried to plunge clubs and gardening implements
into him, and Romeo fought like a drayload of
hytenas for 15 rounds, at the end of which he fled
over the garden-wall. Then the miller fetched a
ladder, and took his shrieking daughter down by
the hair, and cuffed her ears several times. This
subdued her a good deal, and she is shortly to
wed the dull and prosy Hezekfah, who is a man
that won’t stand any foolishness.

The locusts are eating everybody out of
house and home in Victoria, so they are going to
exterminate the “pes s” with ona fell swoop
and a horse-roll e l- . It seems our national song-
bird lays its eggs in the grass, and that a man—by
crawling on his stomach with a m agnlfying glass
for sixteen miles with the thermometer rising
can discover the exact spot where, perhaps, three
locusts are in course of erection. Then he must
mark the spot with a sapling, and go back for tha
roller. The track may not be wide enough to
carry the roller, but the exterminator must be
ready to fell and stump on the shortest notice.
When he gets back to she larvae (which is prob
ably seme time next day) he must rush violently
to and fro for some time until the embryo grass-
eaters have died unnatural deaths. Then he can
go home if he is strong enough, and listen as he
goes to the deafening roar of the enemy in the
waving gum-trees with a victor's smile. We are
a little hazy as to which side wears the victer’s
smile—but the grin in question is around some-
where.

During the trial of Johns for attempted
murder, when “Thunderbolts boy” was cal ed
from the gaol as a witness, the PoLce Sergeant in
attendance carefully removed all portable articles,
inclusive of a heavy leaden inkstand, from within
reach of the prisoner-witness, and took his seat
behind the witness-box, affectionately caressing a
formidable “ Neddy,” which he held ready for

We write this in memory of the

jamin Sullivan was an important individual
dwelling at Port Macquarie fifty-six years ago,
and hia master-mind conceived a gigantic project,
by which the present sites of a dozen towns Mere
to be jumped in one act. His idea was contained
in an epistle which he addressed “ To the Nobility
and Gantry cf the British Empire and Its
Colonies,” and set forth a scheme by which a
“joint stock agricultural, commercial, and politi-
cal company” was to purchase for a million
pounds 20,000,000 acres of the land on the astern
coast. His project was not appreciated, and the

POLITICAL
POINTS
An N.Z. paper pleasantly remarks
“ The Premier left for Nelson to-day. Sir F.
Whitaker and Mr. Mitohelaon went North with
the same object.”
William O’Brien, the Irish patriot,
spent part of the period of bis imprisonment in a
cell nine feet by four. There is a velum a of
Tory civilisation in this fact.
The Governor’s Salary aid Allowances
B 11 has passed both Houses of the N.Z. Legisla-
ture, and has been reserved for approval during
her Majesty's pleasure. The said Bill reduces the
pay of all future Governors; if it guaranteed an in-
crease it wouldn’t have been reserved—uot much t
Sir William Jervois would have got out of bed the
moment it passed and assented to il in his shirt-
tail.
The San Francisco Argonaut fixes up a
paradox :
The Bntthsh Government is endeavouring to govern a
country which it hag not conquered, and the Irish people ate
enoeavturing to enjoy a f ccdom which they have not
achieved. Both people are en-havouring to ascertain what
ia the effect if a feeble Govern—eat c me in conflict with a
powerless rebellion.
Speaking a Bega (N.S.W.) last Friday
Parkes said : ‘' I < onaid i myself one of the most
guileless, simple-minded, tnd open young men in
the country.” But then Parbes doesn't know him
self as his creditors know him. If he could come
outside of himself and lend himself money he
would soon have cause to change his views.
The renegade Liberal, Goachen, justifies
Chief-Secretary Balfour’s brutal administration of
the Coercion Act in Ireland by pointing to sundry
larky cartoons of that eminent official which ap-
peared in United Ireland and the Freeman's
Journal. The dignity of a Tory la an awful
thing, and only blood can wipe out the insult.
In N.Z. the Factory Act limits the
working day to eight hours, and in consequence
the toiler ia undersold in all directions by Im-
poit rs, whose goods are manufactured by white
slaves, who labour 14 hours out of the 24. As the
Government refuses to put on sufficient duties to
balance the d fference, lha Auckland an it ana now
base lire workrooms from their employers ; every
man; ia his own boss, and they labour for 10 or 12
hours a day, and as much more as they darned
well please.
Shiels, of the Victorian Assembly says
bitterly that he “ doesn't know the day wnen, b/
backstairs influence, there may be foisted on the
colony,* a Governor who is a wife-beater, a
drunkard, and a debauchee.” So far, however,
Victoria has fortunately escaped this disgrace;
though she once had a Governor who mashed a
girl in the Botanic Gardens, and her brother came
up and kicked him hard behind.
The Sultan of Turkey celebrated Ma-
homet’s birthday by holding a levee— quite a
radical innovation —at his palace. After sherbet
had been served to 500 Pashas, the Sultan made a
speech, promising to repeat the revelry every
year, and “ his Majesty’s gursts left in a state of
much emotion." The Turk is proverbially a self-
contained cuss, but such royal condescension as
this would wring tears from a graven image.
Mr. Mandeville, the Pdor Law Guardian;,
Who was imprisoned in Tullamore Gaol under the
Tory Coercion Act, refused, like William O’Brien,
to wear the prison uniform, falx warders and the
Governor entered Mandeville’s cell one day and
tore his clothes off him, and for some time he
roamed about his apartment quite naked. He is
now serving out the rest of his Lenience in an old
counterpane. O’Brien's clothej were stolen while
he was asleep, but Mandeville slept in his toggery
and violence became necessary.
Monk, of the N. Z. Legislature, is a serious
and melancholious-looking politician, and is In-
terested in the firewood trade. Naturally enough,,
therefore, ho has a bilious flown on the coal-min-
ing industry, and bo will boom along serenely for
hours about the evil effects of that trade upon the
morals. “If you put a boy into a coal-mine for
four years,” he thundered in a recent oration,
“ that boy won’t come to no good. Now, s’posin
instead you put that boy through a sawmill for
four years he will become “ Sassage,"
roared a tired-out member from a back bench.
‘' Sassage ; sit down ! ”
The legend runs that during the height of
the Trafalgar Square riot, H.R.H,’s softly-padded
hansom—with the animated Royal German sau-
sage inside —became blocked by the “ mob, dent-
yerknow,” and the fat Heir-Apparent sat with his
cigar balanced on his big unlerjaw and his puffy
hands folded on the door of his cab, looking coolly
from right to left at the seething mass of haggard
men and women being bludgeoned by the police.
Afterwards HR H. drove on to Marlborough
House, and ordered a gorge for some of the
valiant policemen (we mean to be sarcastic here),
and the rest of the “blue bottles” were enter-
tained, yer know, poor devils, by the Union Club.
At Bally haut- is, Ireland, three girls and
an old woman of seventy have been sent to gaol
for intimidating and obstructing the bailiffs,
police, and military at a seizure Nr rent on the
Bey tagh Estate ! The desperate criminals were es-
corted to Castlebar Gaol by 100 armed constabu-
lary I Great Scott! Farcy young Biddy Murphy
(aged 14, be iabers!), Kitty O’Brine (in her bare
feet), Molly Maguire (armed with a broom-
handle), and that ould, hoary-headed sinner, Judy
Fogarty, who ought to have known betther, fero-
ciously attacking the military and constabulary,
and bums and sheriffs, till the Gatling guns had
to be turned on the furies, and the infantry had to
charge with the baj onet!
William O'Brien, M.P., when committed
to prison, registered a vow that he would not put
c n prison clothes. While he was In bed in the
gaol hospital, his toggery was stolen by the
warders and the prison rags left in their stead,
and then William refused to get up. One day,
however, the turnkeys were flabbergasted on
going into the hospital to find the O'Brien dretsed
in a rate suit o’ tweed. Up to this hour
no one knows how William got the things. Be
told the governor that they came “ down the
chimney,” and it’s just possible they did. A lot
of O’Brien’s friends were always hanging about
the outside of the gaol. Once a brass band
serenaded him, and William waved the tail of his
shirt from his cell-window in acknowledgment.
(The “authorities” had taken away his pocket-
handkerchief.)
Sir William Fitzherbert, Speaker of the
N. Z. Legislative Council, lately took a little trip
home, partly on his own account, and partly to
exhibit his pompous baldness, at the Imperial
Conference, and whilst he was absent, it was
iccessary to appoint some other affluent old
gent to the chair. He was away some time, but
ultimately he shook the dust of Europe from off
hia simple blutchers, returned to the Parliamen-
tary roof, and took up hia cross once more in the
ecrvice of his country. Then someone accidentally
discovered that under the provisions of the new
Civil Service Reform Act Sir William had for-
feited his old-established pension by absenting
himself from his salaried billet and being re-
appointed thereto, and the curtain descends on a
swindled old politician cursing in the Parliamen-
tary refreshment-room with a great and bitter
curse.
Mr. Pyae, o! Lisfinny Castle, county
Waterford, for whoso arrest a warrant is out, has
fortified his stronghold against police, process-
servers, and the military. The other day a big
deputation came from County Cork with fife and
brass band to bid him hail and ask him how he
was getting on. The demonstration took place
in front of the castle, and the president
perched on a gate-post, as nobody had a chair
about him. Mr. Pyne, who was lowered down by
a rope and pulley till he came within 15 or 20
feet of the ground, was received with tremendous
cheering. He said he was sorry he could not
receive the deputation in person, but those who
wished could come up by the rope and visit him,
and present the address in person. He was wait-
ing peacefully for the police to come and serve the
warrant. If they would knock at his hall-door
(80 feet from the ground) they might be let in, and
if he happened to be from home they could call
another day. Since he entered the castle a lady
had sent him a book on ‘ How to Cook Potted
Meats," and another wrote to know if he was
lonely.
John Taylor, of nowhere in particular,
met with a disaster last week. Having got
drunk, he said his prayers on the permanent way
(which, no doubt, he mistook for the road to
Heaven), and lay down on the railway line to
sleep with the other sleepers. When he rose in
the morning he thought no ’arm had befallen him,
and so it had, for on going to the shanty for a re-
fresher the landlord remarked to him that he had
forgotten one of his semaphores. John went
back to the line and found the missing limb which
he sold for a pint of beer to a travelling bone-
setter.

When Dolly Tester left the footlights to
marry the present Marquis of Ailesbrry, she ap-
pears to have entered a rather choice family. Her
husband did his first royal drunk at the early age
of 10—he was a schoolboy at Eton in these days,
and having a woaful lack of courage and an ap-
pointment with the head-master for the purpose
of being swished he filled himself up with a whole
bottle of brandy as a preliminary—and he has
seldom been sober since. Hij father, commonly
known as “ the Duffer,” was accustomed in his
younger days to make considerable sums of money
at White’s Club by betting on his father's breath as
the most villainous in Europe, but after a while
people began to know the old man’s whitkeyfled
atmosphere, and the income from this source fell
off. But thescene at “ Duffer ” Ailesbury’s death-
bed was the greatest feature in the family history.
When the old reprobate found himself closely
followed by the Pale Horseman —pretl y nearly
the only one whom he hadn’t squared in the
course of his sporting career—he resolved to get
religion, but after half-an-hour of pious medita-
tion he remarked bitterly that he “couldn't re-
pent worth a damn.” Baing painfully hard-up, the
idea of making a collection, as the next best
thing to regeneration by faith, did not occur to
him, and, as a last resource, he sent oat for a
crucifix—the biggest that could be found, and be
dashed quick about it. The article was brought,
and the old peer hung on to it. At this crisis one
of his sporting friends arrived with a view to
bringing some horsey comfort to the dying man,
but the old sinner stated that he had renounced
the pomps and vanities of the flash, and bade him
beeone. “ Well, what the dooce are you doing
with that cross?” asked the ghostly consoler.
“I’m hedging, biggod,” was the reply, and with
that the soul of “the Duffer” passed away, and
young Savernake, with his donkey-cart and h's
costermonger costume, became one of the Peers of
glorious Britain.

One of the most sanguinary and blasting
reverses in the history of ancient or modern war-
fare was recently sustained by a detachment of
the Salvation Army at Oamaru (N.Z.) A ruby-
vested contingent under the command of a she
capting of high degree, sallied forth early one
bright Sunday morning to storm the hotel of a
local sinner, and they banged the big bass drum
and tooted on the bassoon and yelled “ ally-
looyer ” in front of the premises until they roused
the hypochondriac publican from his feather-
bedded lair, and brought him out on the balcony
in an airy cos ume cut low at the skirt, and an
exasperated frame of mind, to ascertain what the
howling hosannah the whole racket was about.
He saw a row of poke-bonnetted females kneeling
in the slush, and a crowd of iron-jawed men
holding forth, and then he twigged the moral
aspect of the situation. The man of many beers
was a J.P., so he swiftly skimmed back into the
house for his pants and the Riot Act, and
re appearing on the balcony, he held up
the one and read the other in a sleepy
voice to the immortal choir below. They
took no notice whatever of these proceedings,
and ho next ordered them to disperse In the name
of her Gracious, and fixed his brace buttons and
solemnly put on his boots. “ Now,” he said, em-
phatically, “ are this baleful gathering of lunatics
going to skip off my licensed premises, or are
they going to continue to flop in defiance of the
statoon ? ” They responded by sending up a peti-
tion sky-high in favour of this “ pore” miserable
sinner’s immortal soul. “Very g jod,” said the pub-
lican, grimly, “ then I'm a-coming down." And
he came. He gathered together every able-bodied
citizen on the premises who was capable of bear-
ing arms, and, after loading them up with brooms,
fire-irons,, tin-kettles, old boots, dinner bells,
kerosene-tins, and chair-legs, he loosed the dog, and
they all charged out by the back-door, and wor-
ried the Army in the rear. Wherever they saw a
head they welted it, and the skirmish lasted just
10 seconds by rhe Waterbury which the boy who
cleaned the boots had bought cheap at a sale. The
shemale cipling was the first to turn her bustle
and flee for her life down the street, and the con-
tingent followed wilh ths dog a good third, amid
a storm of howls, mud, and derision. Sundry old
poke-bonnets were left behind as the spoils of
war, and one heavy saved dragoon who could not
keep up with the rest was considerably harassed
about the legs. They never returned to that
hotel, and ever since then balmy peace has reigned
at Oamaru.

The thrilling and wildly interesting news that Mrs. Lang-
try takes a cold bath every day has gotten to us The pecu-
liar softness and dimness of the atmosphere and sky lately
seemed to forbode S'me strange and startling occurrence. It
must have found itself in the Langtry tub. For some unac-
countable reason, we are not in receipt, up to the present, of
news rega-ding tans,try's soap, or whether she uses any.
Does she prefer bran ! Or it may be that borax is the fa-
vourite bathing tipple of the Englishwoman ? Does she use
smooth towels or rough ? Do they have blue borders or red 1
Perhaps a plain white checked or striped border, not wide,
yet not n»rrow, is the choice. If she uses soap, does she
place it on the ledge of the tub, and does it go sliding across
the bath-room floor when she knocks it with her elbow ? If
so, does she jump out of the water and capture it, or does she
balance herself on the edge and try to haul it in with her flesh-
brush ? Or, perhaps, after all, she places thesoap in the dish
at the head nnybe the foot of the tub, or yet again on a
chair by her side. With eager intensity we await the answer
as to whether the Lily’s fingers squeeze a sp' nge or wring a
wash rag. Does she take the plug our. before she gets out or
when she stands up to rub herself V Or does she ute the
English tub, that’s lugged in and out ? If so, why ? Her
passionately desired American citizenship entit’es her to an
American tub. It is slightly cofliny, as a rule, bit one has
to get used to that sooner or late . Most people prefer it
later. Has she telephonic communication with any real
estate firm, so that while taking a bath she need lose no
time in buying real estate and 700-acre ranches? When the
breath-holding West has the foregoing conundrums an-
swered it will feel that through Mrs. Langtry s tub the cob-
webs of curiosity have been washed away.

Extract from the Sydney Mail of Decem-
ber 10:
Burglars entered a house at Highgate while the family
were dining, and upset a bath, the witer of which, to the
surprise of those below, came trickling through the ceiling
Mrs. Oasey, the wife of a medical man. It is alleged that
the prisoners, instead of presenting Mrs. Casey, who was
then in a dying state, for the usual examination, put for-
ward a woman of robust health, who was accepted.
There is a wide field of possibilities in this little
item. When burglars upset a bath on a woman
of robust health, who tsai accepted—l hough what
she was accepted for or whether she accepted the
bath, or the burglars accepted her, is not very
clear—they undoubtedly acted in a more gecorous
manner than if they had upset the bath on Mrs.
Casey, considering that she was in a dying condi-
tion ; but even if the burglars had “ presented
Mrs. Casey ” that -wouldn't have stopped the
water from trickling through the ceiling. Ard if
the water had trickled through the ceiling on to
Mrs. Casey in her dying cordition, the coate
quences might have been serious, so it is just pcs
slble the woman In robust health—no, that can’t
be, for it appears that Mrs. Casey was not pre-
sented for the usual examination to see if she
could stand, having the bath upset on her because
—but, on the other hand, that dotsa't account for
the surprise of those below, and id doesn't say be-
low what, S 3 we are forced to the cinclusion—on
second thoughts we give it up.

The poor Argus iives| in the past— the
buried past, and even the special coi respondents
don’t understand how the world is wagging now-a-
days. A Milan letter to that “leading journal”
discusses the recent visit of Kaiser Wilhelm to
his “royal brother. King Victor Emanuel, of
Italy." If the cast-iron Emperor had already
suconmbid to the effect of lobster salad on a
venerable stomach we could understand him
hugging Victor Emmanuel—but not in Milan.
W'hen those royal brothers do meet It will be else-
where—not there, not there, my child. At thaa
time, maybe, the literary Lazarus will be placidly
laving his white wings with cool fresh water from
thi b?autiful river, while the royal brothers ai e
offering him their kingdoms for a drink. Yrs, in
strict confidence we must whisper to the Argus
that Victor Emanuel is deader than colonial beer.
What can the special correspondent at Milan be
about not to know that Emperor Wiliiam went
there to visit Jalius Ceesar on the occasion of his
jubilee ?

Up on a Queensland station, a few yerr
ago. there lived a young Victorian swell who hat
been sent away from the haunts of civilisation
cool down. It was a lonely, arid spot where h
found himself planted—there was no hotel an
no theatre, no block to do to girls to mash ex
cept one dishwalloping slavey with tha intellect
a heifer, no larks of any kind, and no nice fellow
to talk to, and ha did not take kindly to th
heavy-booted race who devoted their lives to tb
study of the walking realm of baaf So ha mashe
a iubra, and tha dark-skinned daughter of th
soil gave him her heart, and was betrayed—jus
by way of a joke, don’t you know. Then, after
while, the Victorian swell was fouad scattered
loosely on the plain, with a spear stuck through
his back and his held nearly hacked off with
boomerang. The local papers wept and ravec
over “ this bright young life, cut off in th
flower of its thicgamy by these black demons wh
deserve extermination,” and the troopers wen
out and came across a tribe who had never seen
or heard cf the bright young deceased, and ther
was a numerous funeral in that region, and al
that was left of the tribe wasn’t enough to swea
by. A large idiotic stone-fihb was put over the
Victorian swell, with numerous virtues inscribed
on it, ar.d the officer of police sent in his repor
which was duly initialed and pigeon-holed by
young man in the Civil Service, who relnctantl;
stopped sucking the top of his cane to do It, anc
said it was an awful “ haw,” and the lubra was
clubbed to death by an incensed male relative and
the dingoes got her. That was all. There is no
poetic justice to tail on to the story. It ends
right here.

A correspondent writes :
Of all t.he noxious animals to bs met with in Australia
the “ English gentleman” is about the noxiousest. A tot
generous Legislature has, so far, brought no rfpress've mea
sures to bear against him. He goes about like a roaring lion
where he llsteth, and it is, unreasonably enough, accnuntec
a crime to kill him There is no penalty attached to his
entry or exit. He n not poll-taxed, as is the case with the
hss loudly offensive Chinaman ; nor is he blocked anc
watched till there is a chance of running him in, aa is usua
with escaped convicts from New Caledonia. He is not
liable to specific duty at the Custom House, nor is there any
id valorem duty chargeable against him—this, perhaps, for
the sufficient reason that ad valorem duty amounts tc
nothing on anything which has no diecoverable value. Ho is
not even liable to an annual fee for registration, in this re-
spect obtaining an unfair advantage over the other pup ; nor
is he obliged t a give notice of his intention to exist, as is
usual in the case of some other ki da of nuisance. He is
under no disabilities whatever. The full rights of citizenship
are accorded him. He may vote, mw become a suburban
alderman, and attain to other glories with impunity. So
long as he is moderately sober when in the street, the law
permits him to confer his baleful presence and the
full measure of his querulous iosolence upon the
patient abiders on this Continent. Of course,
there are plenty of genuine gentlemen, »ho are
Englishmen, but they have nothing in common with the fly
in the public ointment who travels round perpetually how-
ling that he is an “ English gent'eman." Within five seconds
of the time you first meet the latter human he impresses
this pleasant fact upon your mind, and then he goes on to
tell you of the surpassing excellence of Englishmen in
general and of himself in particular, also the elevated posi-
tion of his family, and how he suffers, as an English gentle-
man, from association with the awful, vulgar ends one
meets in this horrid country. With him every Australian
prospect displeases and the inhabitants are abyssmally vile.
If he affects politics at all they are exclusively English
politics—in fact he doesn't believe that there are any other
on the face of the earth; he moans about the principle of
manhood suffrage, and tells in his culch' wed way how states-
manship disappeared when Disraeli died, and how that
shining Jingo, with the well-oiled loots, has been succeeded
by a lot of common individuals who, instead of propping up
the throne, actually keep worrying about low Irishmen.

When all N.S.W. is getting ready to paint
itself rad, and every colonist is practising how to
snpport himself by the lamp-post and unlock the
street-door with his feet—it is soothing to learn
that what the S.M. Herald calls “ the dark
skinned natives ” are not to be overlooked. That
heavy-footed journal states with tears of printer’s
ink that “The celebration of the end of the first
100 years of Australian civilisation has, doubtless,
a pathetic meaning to the da - k-skinned natives,”
and in view cf this harrowing circumstance King
Billy and his Mary are to be allowed to erntenni-
ate, too —but mildly, as it the colony had her in-
solvent stop down and couldn’t hang the expense.
Says the Herald :
. The chief direction in which they will receive relief will be
m the supply of clothing to helpless or sick people, and es-
pecially will the women and children be remembered: the
others will be provided with a good meal, and a still more
valued gift of a qu rter of a pound of tobacco.
A few yards of print, a square meal for the men,
and a quarter of a pound of vile tobacco each,
constitutes the Centenary of the Simon Pure Aus
tralian, while the white pirates who camp on
stolen ground—who fill up the harbour with
sewage and turn an erstwhile eligible solitude
into a hideous brick and-mortar nightmare of four
rooms and a kitchen —are going to celebrate their
robbery in a ragieg ocean of booze. We feel this

The other day, just as the noon train for

loiterers, and scattering luggeee all over the place
in his wild career. Running along the fca’n, till
he came to a carriage occupied by a woman, a
baby, and a young man of nervous temperament,
he opened the door and entered. Immed ately
after dull thuds, sounds of byaler a, and lush rro-

According to an eminent European scien-
tist, civilisation is gradually wearing away the
human nose, and looking with prophetic eye down
the vista of futurity, ho sees a coming race
with no nose at all. The original savage u-ed his
nose to smell with, but a too-reflaed generatun
hires an inspector of nuisances to remove every-
thing smellable. and the disused organ is fading
away as the human family gets nearer and nearer
to perfection. For our own part, we can quite
believe this theory. In Ne w So Ah Wales the
hangman is pretty nearly the only existing evi-
dence of progress, and he is without a nos?. It
was the want of this organ, too. which gained
him his billet. Quite unconsciously he ha«l
attained the topmost plane of civilisation, ani
being thus fitted for greatnes 0 , he rote like a cork
to the surface of society. It was his nose that
did it—or rather his want of that blowable organ.
Being ourselves weighted down with the double-
dyed curse of a nose, we have never become £ no-
thing In particular, and unless we manage to
place that feature beneath a tram-car, we don t
suppose we ever will. Goodness only nose.

rush out with his gloves on his feet and one boot
on each hand—but alas ! it was too late. Plunging
into the darkness of the shop, he drove bis head

bottles of infallible hair-restoror, and then be

The malarious town of Rockhampton
(Q ) seems at last to stand a fair show of being
shovelled away bodily and sown with salt. The
Fitzroy River has never tmounted to much more
than a large bridge over a very small amount of
water, and now that Port Alma is risk g to im-
portanc, tie steamers which used to come up
ia the ca-ly dew have taken to unloading in

order to get cut of the place, and in other wajs
the city of transgression and pe’rspiraiion shows
signs of going on a sh rt cut to tie dogs.
Old Bill Campbell, of Ravenswcod (Q ), is
a cute fcsslcker. If there were any go d getting,
Bill, by his perseverance and devilish ounnirg,
would h'.va his whack. He is a thoroughly fierce
old Scot and tremendously iroud of his name.
His chiefest prida is the history of his family,
which he can tr .ee back int) remote antiqui'y,
and boast is that none ol them ever turned
their back upon tl eir enemy, even when leafing
a judicious retreat after a marauding expedition
in quest cf their neighbour's cattla and fowls.
Like a war-horse that stiffs the hat la from afar,
old Bill was carried away by the glowing accounts
of the Kimberley goldfield, and, rolling up his
drum, was among the first in the crush to get to
that land of rough peaks and deep gorges. Bill,
like most secretive men, loved solitude, and used
to poke away Into lonely corners. He was warned
that his predilection for fladirg and having a rich
patch all to himself would bring him to grief some
day, but he had a supreme c ntempt for the
oi inions of others, and ht Id on his way. One day,
while sitting ia a deep gully, balancing his
accounts, and having a snack from off the
back cf his inverted dish, which was placed
between his legs, and turned into an
impromptu dining-table, Bill was suddenly
startled by an infernal crash. Looking down, he
beheld a quivering spear right through the tin
di-h and into the ground beyond, and the rattle*
of several others that fell among the rocks around.
In a moment Bill s ears were saluted by hideous
yells, and thjn he saw half-a-dozen niggers on a
high bank close to him, preparing to give him
another volley of spears. Then did old Bill Camp-
bed curse his fchy in not bringing his revolver ;
bnt, nothing daunted, ha seized his long-handled
shovel, and brand shed it over his head as if to
charge the niggers But, seeing that they evidently
meant to make v enison of him, he took a bee-lina
for home, with the darkies “full split” af:er him.
In that moment of (xoi'.ement Bill quite forgot
ancestral pride and dignity —wiih his back to
hla foes he ran for dear life Fortunately, the
yells of his pursuers attracted the attention of a
party that happened to be in the vicinity, who
hastened to his succour. A week after this, Bill
returned to camp one evening to find his tent,
tucker, and horse had been stolen. He had some
hard times after tha* - , bat gob back to civilisation
at last. Whenever his friends want to see him
blow off steam, they refer to Kimberley, and the
old hay sta v ts off at a tangent, to the intense
delight of his audience.
The Croydon (Q.) goldfield is a lively place
where something is always in progress. One day
it ia the two beaks who are doing the wild-cat act
in the street, and clawing each other to flinders,
and the next the spite of the rival editors breaks
loose, and, a'ter a long course of inky and “ inky-
herent” reflections upon each other’s character, one
attacks his neighbour wi h a cowhide, a razsr, a
poker, and two hammers, and the assaulted party
defends himself with a club, a toy the, three
bricks, and a large bull-pup. This amutement
has hardly lad time to subside, and the editors
have just got back to their respective offices and
commenced two articles on “The Necessity for
Better Police Protection,” when a digger strolls
into the dining-room of the hotel, and there find-
ing a perfect stranger putting hash into his
features, he thinks it necessary to jerk his head
forward and empty the remains of the dinner
down the back of his neck. Th’s naturally leads
to more trouble, and shortly afterwards a man is
seen going up the street carrying the most of his
ear wrapped in a newspaper, and inquiring for
the doctor. Most of the time a big man is trying
to tear down the post-office because there isn’t a
letter for Terence O’Muiphy, and when he hasgone
another man breaks all the windows because there

By the River.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I lie by the stream, S 3 dismal and dank.
To myself unchanged, j eb when strangers see
My lurking place 'neath the caving bank
They fine in affright from my grave and me.
Slow at my feet rolls the slimy stream,
’Neath the clustering myalls that line the
shore,
And ’midst the boulders I lie and dream,
And the worms are my guests for evermore.
Over my head the green branches wave
With a hum like the noise of a breaking ssa,
And the carrion birds by my open gr-va
Sing dolorous songs to the river and me.
It is lonely here in this leafy hall,
Bat the voice of the gale is loud and free,
And when evening shades on the fcrest fall
We hold high revel—the Devil and me.
And my fleshless lips wear a smile alway,
While stiff on the rotten bank I slumber,
And the leaves and I together decay
’Mid tints of gold and funereal umber.
Where I fell I lie, the dark rolling waters
Still whisper the tale cf that tragedy.
While earth's unheeding sons and daughters
Paes laughingly by my grave and me.
So I lie here and wait—l have waited long—
For the second coming of that branded Cain,
And his hated presence shall make me strong,
At his hated voice I shall rise aga'n,
Then my bony arms shall be round him cast,
And the vengeance of God shall awaken at last;
And his corpse will rot by the blackened shore,
And his face will bo seen among men no more,
And sharing with me my bed of clay,
His bones will be found on the Judgment Day ;
And the carrion birds will join in my glee
Singing dolorous songs to the river and me.

Vital Questions III!
Ask the most eminent Physician
Of any school, what is the best thing in the
world for quieting and allaying all irritation of the
nerves, and curing all forms of nervous complaints,
giving natural, childlike refreshing sleeo always ?
And they will tell you unhesitatingly
“ Some form of Hops ! ! ! ”
chapter i.
Ask any or all of the most eminent physicians
“ What is the best and only remedy that can be
relied on to cure all diseases of the kidneys and
urinary organs ; such as Br ght’s disease, diabetes,
retention, or inability to retaia urine, and all the
diseases and ailments peculiar to Women ”
And they will tell you explicitly and emphati-
cally “ Buchu."
Ask the same physicians
“ What is the most reliable and surest cure for al
liver diseases or dyspepsia ; constipation, indiges-
tion, biliousness, malaria, fever, ague, &c.,’’ and
they will tell you ;
Mandrake or Dandelion ! ! / /
Hence when these remedies are combined with
others equally valuable,
And compounded into Dr. Soule’s American Hop
Bitters, such a wonderful and mysterious cura-
tive power is developed, which is so varied in its
operations that no disease or ill-health can possibly
exist or resist its power, and yet it is
Harmless for the most frail woman, weakest in-
valid or smallest child to use.

Gentlemen, —I have great pleasure In rooom l-
- Row’s D anellon Bitters. I have been 1
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,,
and been under several doctors for It without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different

all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them, —

depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change In
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.

Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex
or children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
Row’s Steane’s Wine.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. YOUNQ LADIES can take
this when suffering from general debility. It’s
only a pure tonic. Try it.
READ CERTIFICATE RESPECTING ITS
PURITY.
“Having carefully examined a bottle of ROW’S
‘STBANE”S’ WINK, manufactured by Edward
Row and Company, I consider them a very whole-
some tonic, suitable for persons suffering from
weak digestion, being perfectly free from any in-
jurious chemic *ls, too often used in such prepara-
tions. They t-hould become a favorite drink in
these warm climates.
(Signed) JOHN M'KILLOP, analyst.
“ Sydney, December 23, 1884.”
Row’s Steane’s wine
has also weaned many persona from the excessive
use of ardent spirits.
TEETOTALLERS will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
Instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

A chunk of useless Information from
Sydney E. News “ Tie a fresh onion around the
neck, and bruise it to make Its odor thorough,
and you secure sound sleep from nightly inhala-
tion." An asafoetida poultice placed on the chest
and covered with the skin of a polecat is also
said to produce the sweetest slumbers. When the
artificial aids to “ Nature's sweet restorer
cannot be had the best thing to do is to secure
bedroom with a window overlooking a Woolloo
mooloo sewer.
A young fellow named M‘Neil recently
jumped into the front rank of English billiard
players by winning a tournament in splendid style
The inevitable match between M'Ntil and John
Roberts, jun., wss then arranged, the champior
giving 5000 in 12,000-spot-barred. Roberts de-
feated the newa pirant by 1500 points, and Is re-
ported to have shown finer play than ever. Scul-
lers, swimmers, shooters, runners enjoy their little
hour of pre-eminence and drop into obscurity,
but two champions—W. G. Grace and Jack
Roberts—have held their place while babies have
grown up to ba young men and marriageable
maidens. Considering the nature of Roberts’ oc-
cupation, that he lives the best part of his life in
a vitiated atmosphere, and under a strong gas
he must have a wonderful constitution. He
doesn’t inherit ic from that tough veteran, John
Roberts, sen., for the old man is his stepfather
only.
A saved Chinaman, of whom better things
were expected, went on a wholesale and retail
drunk recently in a N. Z, township, and the way
he carried on will be remembered when a good
many other memories have passed away. A
Chinaman doesn t go on a druok the same way as
a white man, and this particular Chow had evi-
dently never been t*ght before. He was simply
trying an experiment. In the first place, he went
into a brewery and bought a whole keg of beer,
and then he took out the plug in the middle of the
street and, rolling the keg on top of himself,
poured the beer into his face until he contained
about three quarts, after which he left the cask
standing in the middle of the road, and cleared
the deck for action. A policeman’s dignity is a
holy thing, but when a somnolent “cop”catnebask-
Ing round the corner, this Chinaman gave a
whoop and slogged him in the jaw, thereby being
guilty of drunkenness and disorderly conduct, dis-
turbing the peace, obscene language, obstructing
the street, rioting, and assault with intent to com
mit homicide, also tearin’ me uniform, grievous
bodily harm, and interfering with an officer in the
execution of his duly. He found a tabby oat
sleeping on a window sill a moment later, and bit
off two-tnirds of its tall, whereupon it let a dismal
screech out of itself, and next he rolled his keg
•of beer down hi 1, and laughed as it travelled
along at the rale of several miles in a very short
time, and scrunched an old lady beneath its
flying form. He b eke three windows with an
axe, and split a deg down the back, and then he
took off eome of his clothes and stood up in a
public thoroughfare. Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like him, and if he had been in
N.S W. he would have been flogged. A little
later he was heard of Ring down in the parlour
of an elderly maid-n lady, bat when she found
him and serfam*d, he left through tbe window,
caps’ziog a horse-load of bric-a-brac wi h his
flying heels, and backed a cart filled with road-
scrapings ioto a ba,.k. A policeman loomed up in
the distance about this lime, bit the hinaman
ate a part of him le ore he succeeded ia stunning
him wit hms club. In tbe lock-up ihe reccllec
tions of his Sunday-school le-sons began to cone
bacx to him, and he shook the building with his
yells, and staged with curses that be wanted to
get out and s'a.-d dr.nks a l round for the Scribes
and Pharisees Then he wept, and broke every-
thing in his cell, and tried to hang himself, bat
was cut down in lime, and finally he went to
sleep as peacefully as an infant, and woke up next
morning to get three months from a cold and
supercilious beak. There are a good many points
about a Chinese drunk, bat the purchase of a
Whole keg of bee-, the greater part of which he
merely rolled downhill instead of drinking it,
shows how terribly behind the age is the Chow of
the nineteenth century.

YOU KNOW BEST.
Or yon ought to. Time is a popular belief
which in some cases perhaps is a delusion, that
you have always a healthy and well-developed
reason on hand for the performance of lh~se
duties or pleasures which you are pleased
imagine distinguishes you from your fellows. Yo
sit down when you are tired, go to bed when yo
are sleepy, laugh when you are merry, eat whe
you are hungry, and drink when you are dry
Possibly you drink some’.imes when you are no
exactly dry, but when you have soma othe
equally sound and cogent reason for It. Perhap
you are just “ a trills off” owing to your res a be
ing disturbed by the youngest, who is teething, o
it may be you are somewhat enervated by th
heat during a prolonged attendance ou your wif
through a shopping tour. But, whatever th
reason, it is yours, and you have a perfect righ
to It. You want a drink that will revive and
Invigorate you, something that will dispel th
sense of fa igue and make you feel as ‘'fla” as the
oft quoted fiidle. Instinctively you thick o
Clausen's Champagne Lager Beer, beciuee you
have heard and read so muoh about it, a:d your
friends have spoken se highly in its favour
Your instincts are !rue and goal, jou drink it
and henceforward you never thick of asking for
anything else when you want a p ire honest drink
made from straight out m alt and hops. And hav
ing discovered its value, you keep it In the house
as well, and you prefer to pay a few pence
dozen more for it, because la the exercise of your
everyday commoa sense y;u know that a really
good thing is always worth more than a doubtful
oue. You feel that you can rely on it, and that
the statements made by competent an horlties
with regard to its purity and Invigorating qualities
are amply sustained by the good name and popu-
larity it has so long enjoyed ; and, berane you
are a sensible man, you shy at iho 19 brands which
have to lower tne'.r prices to gat into consum otion.
Iu nothing so mueh as In what you drink is there
the same possibility of terrible iuj ary to health,
and nowhere Is the danger greater than In the
low class brands of Lager Beer. You can always
gat the genuine Ciausea s New York Chamoagne
Lager Beer from Messrs. Mason Brothers, limited,
Fesq and Co., Tooth and Co , Alio and Co., Bur
rows and Gleeson, Lucas Brothers, R. Butcher

haunted me for years, caused by a sick family and large bi is
fcr doctoring, which did no good. I was comiletely dis-
couraged. until one year avo, by the advice of my pastor, I
procured Da Soule s American Hop Bitters and commenced
their use, and in one month we were til well, and none of us
have been sick a day since; and I want to say to ad poor

PREJUDICE KILLS.
“ Eleven years our daughter suffered on a bed of misery
under the care of several of the best (and some of the worst)
physicians, who gave her disease various names but no relief,
and now she is restored to us in good hnlth by as simple a
r medy as Dr. Soule's American Hop Bitters, that we had
pcohed at for two years, before usmg it We earnt stly hope,
and pray that no on-, else will let their s’ck suffer as we o'id,
on account of prejudice agiiost so g ;od a mi dioine as Dr.
Sou’e’s American Hop Bitters." The Parents “ Telegram."
A Good Remedy for a Cold —On going to bed take a
dose of Freeman's Chlorodyue, either in water or camphor
mixture. The dial horetio action of this excellent remedy
speedily produces a general glow, followed by a free pei spira-
tirn, during which the pulse improves in character from a
feeble to a full, elastic one, a good night's sleep is obtained
and on waking in the morning the co;d will be found to have
disap earered. The ce.tainty of the action of Freeman’s
Chlorodjne is very rem.rkablo in Ague; it frequently pre-
vents an attack, or, fail.ng this, reduces the violence of the
atue fit to a minimum. In many countries F eeman s
Cclotodyne has entirely superseded the use of Quinine, and
in the tea gardens rf India no'hing else is given fur Agu"
and other forms of Fever. A Physician writes, “ In a sub
tropical climate, such as New South Wales, Freeman's
Chlorodyne is simply invaluable "—So d every where through-
out the Colonies. Insist ujon having “freeman's" only

Consumption, Wasting Diseases and General
Debii I. y —Doctors disagree as to the relative value of
Cod Liver Oil and Hypophosphitesthe one supplying
strength and flesh, the other giving nerve j ower and acting
as a tonic to the digestive and entire system But in
“ Scott s Emulsion of Pure Cod Liver Oil with
Hypophosphites " the two are combined, and th j effect is
wonderful. Thousands who have derived no permanent
benefit from other preparations have been curel by this
Scott's Emulsion is perfectly pal. table and is easily
digested even by those who cannot tolerate plain Cod Liver
Oil. Sold by all Chemists, two sizes, large and small.*

up, and atrociously effective both on friends and on enemies. Six circular pictures, each about the
size of a crown piece, can be taken on one plate with most astonishing speed and perfect accuracy.
This Camera can be worn under a coat or dress, the lens projecting through a button-hole cannot be
obeerved, and the simple action of pulling a cord hands down to either reverence or ridicule every
Incident included within the scope of its vision. The “POTSHOT” Camera Is not a toy, but a
really serviceable instrument of the class known as “ DBTECTIYB ” Cameras. At the same time
an immense amount of fun can be got out of it, and photographs of people and things obtained with
ease which are practically impossible by any other method. A limited number only have been

th at recently went leather-hunting for Stoddarb
and Co. Ulyett grimly remarked that he didn’t
consider himself exactly a “colt," but he felt
capable of being a grandson to the smallest Vic-
torian “junior." With a strange matting wicket
and such matured specimens of our boys to con-
tend against, the Englishmen felt themselves to
be rather “ had,” and will probably avoid these
unsatisfactory matches in the future.

W. H. Brown, who comes from “ the
Shore,” states that he is anxious to meet George
Seale “ to a finish for the amateur championship.
Brown is fully six feet in height and a most
powerful man, but size alone will not beat the
little phenomenon.

Gorman and B 11 S'avin, “to a finish,”
was the tit-bit at Foley’s on Saturday night.
Gorman went to work directly the men put thalr
hands np, and the*e ensued the fastest and most
bloodthirsty first round we had ever witnessed,
Slavin havlrg the call when corners we’e called
For four rounds Slavin punished and Gorman re
oelved. but in the flfih, to everybody’s disgust.
William quitted, and the bruised and astounded
Gorman was declared the winner. Slavin gave as
reason that hia left hand was knocked up.

| [Costello’s acceptance of the offer of £26
to nothing that Peter Jackson could not knock
him out in four rounds shows the Yankee’s grit.
Were we in Costello’s place we would as soon
take £25 to tight four rounds with a circular-saw
or a tram-motor. However, there is no account-
ing for taste.

Poor Alec Robertson, who was done to
death by the unlucky Silvemine, is now credited
with more “remarks" just before he fell than ho
would have had time to relieve himself of in a
journey from here to Melbourne. After a man Is
gone it is always remembered that be made a lot
of historic utterances in his last moments, and
died giving his opinion on everyth’ng under the
sun.

Away In a beck-blocks township of
N.S.W. the local storekeeper is an Orangeman of
the most eggravatlngly yellow description. He is
also a sporting man, and owns a horss of great
suddmirfes and velocity. In the same town hangs
out a wandering son of Krin who pos esses a mare
which, he has always believed, can beat any
crater on f <mr legs. For months the storekeeper
nagged a h*m with a view to getting on a match
for £5O, ani at last he fairly bounced the Hiber-
nian in'o declaring that he would race any dirthy
Prrdeatant on earth for everything he had, clown
to his shirt. Pat j aw ed every mevab'e he owned
on earth to raise the £lO deposit, and then he
went round, and laid the case before
h’s clan, and every broth of a bhoy—
every Hooligan and Flaherty in the towmhlp—
planked down his subscription. Amorg them
they made up the money all bat £5, and his re-
verence the praete supplied that for the glory cf
the saints. When the race came off 50 strong-
lunged Irishmen whooped behind the bay mare,
and that terrified animal ran as she had never
run before, and beat the Protestant heme by tbe
length of a street, and there was a howling
Limerick spree out of the winnings Even his
revei enoe the praste looked in at the banquet, and
the toast of the evening was “ God help the Irish,
for be jabers the Prodeetauts can look after them-
selves."
The outside public were considerably in-
terested in lhorp?’s first appearance on the Mel-
bourne ground. Though the Parramatta dark
colt took none of the Erglist men’s wickets the
general opinion was that be performed well with
the ball, and that Garrett Didn’t give him enough
show. Rough remarks too, were made when ha
was sent in “last man ’ for the eecond innings,
just in time to see his very indifferent partrec
get caught out.

Soil anoiher poor unprotected male has
been arrested over a railway carriage affair.
Thatanything but gay Lothario, Harry Hutchens,
the sprfrter, was charged by a solitary female
with having attempted to drug her. It appears
that Harry coughed violently cut of the window
for soma time, and then ostentatiously drew out a
large, clean ponkot-handkerchlef with which to
mop h's penpMog countenance, and the virgin,
whi was al>ne wi-h him, imagined that she smelt
chloroform, and that ahe waa going to bo
smoih'red with Ham's freshly mangled rag. She
so: earned and gave him in charge, but the oaie
was dismissed.
Pants the hert for cooling streams,
Tia, too, for streams the bushman pants,
But the Kljsium of his dreams
Is one square yard of shade sans ants.
