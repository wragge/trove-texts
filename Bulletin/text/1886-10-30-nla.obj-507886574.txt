The Queen’s Jubilee.
To the Jews must be credited the institution
of the jubilee. The world’s indebtedness to
this ancient people has been, and still is,
very great. Not to Imperial Rome itself do
the nations owe so much gratitude—and
money—as to the ingenious race whose
enterprise in book-making alone, beginning
with the Pentateuch, has done so much to
instruct and ravish mankind. But there is
an essential difference between the old
method of jubilation as once carried out
every fiftieth year by the chosen salt in dis-
tant Palestine, and the new as adopted by
Britons when their monarchs are considerate
enough to occupy the throne during half a
century. Under the former plan, slaves
were set free and alienated land reverted
to its original owners. Under the latter,
both toilers and soil remain much as they
were.
* * . «
It is just 49 years since the “ Sailor King ”
dropped the reins of Government into his
niece’s hands and descended to join his
lamented predecessors. As a monarch he
was not an entire success. The necessity
for signing the great Reform Bill distressed
him and caused him to use language charac-
terised by vigour rather than polish. Owing
probably to his early training, his choice of
words on most state occasions was limited
and infelicitous. At his first Council he
evinced commendable grief for his brother
George's death, but marred the effect a
little by remarking, “ This is a damned bad
pen.” Mrs. Jordan, who bore him nine
children, he allowed to starve in a strange
land. It is, however,, but fair to say that he
behaved well towards his little ones-—the
Fixzclarences and generously billeted
them on the nation, from which they have
drawn just a quarter of a million of money
since their father’s death. But his smartest
exploit was done hr conjunction with his
brothers, Wales and York, years pre-
viously. All were in debt—it is a royal
privilege—and so issued joint-and-several
bonds for large sums at high interest. Many
of these were taken up in France, between
which country and England war was then
raging. The holder having crossed the
Channel to press their claims, were seized
under the Alien Act, and sent home only to
be pounced upon when they got there and
beheaded at Paris for corresponding with the
enemy. There tons some pleasure in being
an English Royal Duke 90 years ago.
* * *
A few months since, our beloved Queen
having entered on the fiftieth year of her
reign, the Mayor of Sydney embraced the
happy idea of gathering around him all the
aldermen and chief magistrates of Austra-
lasian cities to rejoice befittingly. The con-
ception was pleasant, and its success entire.
For they have come and gone, have intro-
duced among us many novelties appertaining
to municipal government, and, doubtless,
made themselves acquainted with new
methods to elaborate and," perhaps, adopt in
their distant homes. .At first there was
some slight uneasiness as to whether the be-
ginning or the end or the fiftieth year was
the more appropriate period for carousing,
but in a letter to the press Mayor Young
produced precedents to prove that any time
between the forty-ninth and fiftieth years
would do. Only three English sovereigns,
it appears, have completed the half-century
in office. They were Henry 111., Edward
111., arid GeJrge ill. Oh each occasion
their subjects rejoiced,Tpid were glad. Why
they did so we shall '\mdeavour to show.
Henry IJI., the son of J ohn, took early to
the regal business. As a boy he came to the
throne in 1216, and, except for a severe cor-
rection administered to him in 1205 by
SfMON de Montfort, the founder of the
House of Commons, held it pretty firmly
till 1272, when death called upon him and
demanded an audience. He was known as
cor cereum regis, or “ royal wax heart,” to some
of his subjects, arid as “the bitter king ” to
others. He rode like a tailor, bragged like a
Parolees, and fought like a Falstaff. He
permitted his attendant swash-bucklers to
quarter themselves on his long-suffering
subjects, to eat them out of house and home,
and to cut their throats if they objected. In
the doggerel of the day he was described as
“ the enemy of the whole realm, of the
Church, and of Goo.” His father was the
champion scoundrel of Christendom. “Foul
as it is,” says an old chronicler, “ hell
itself is defiled by the fouler presence of
John.” This same John it was who in his
rage for having been forced to sign “ Magna
Oharta,” rolled on the ground “ gnawing
sticks and straw.” And dearly he made the
English pay for their Charter, for with the
■ sweepings of Continental brothels at his
back he marched up and down the land
slaying all who would say him nay. Henry,
for whom our first jubilee was held, was a
worthy son of the gentle John.
* * *
Edward 111. also began betimes at 14,
and having thrown France into confusion
and half-depopulated Scotland, became the
puppet of a dirty baggage whp, on his death,
stripped the body and decamped. As for
our present ruler’s grandfather :
“ George the First was reckoned vile —viler George
the Second ;
And what mortal ever heard any good of George
the Third?”
If Jambs IT. “threw away three kingdoms
for a mass,” the narrow-minded, obstinate
George, in his published wantonness, jet-
tisoned the grandest heritage a nation ever
possessed. To keep it company he sent
overboard 50,000 brave men, £140,000,000,
and a large slice of the national honour.
Like James 1., he was the bitter foe of all
talent. But for his recurring attacks of
lunacy he would either have lost his throne
—perhaps his head—or have made England
as absolute a monarchy as Russia. It was
the success of the Americans that saved
England. Had the King unfortunately
won, as was very nearly the case more than
once, some of the most gifted Englishmen
would have quickly found, as their fathers
did under the insensate Stuarts, that life
within the four seas was too full of danger
to be agreeable. In Buckle’s great work
the curious reader can obtain information
which may, perhaps, surprise him con-
cerning the direction towards which Great
Britain was drifting when the clear cry of
defiance was sent across the Atlantic.,
Turning from the historian’s account of the
advances made towards Cmsarism by the
half-witted Guelph, to Mayor Young’s
statement of the “ loyalty arid joy” which
bubbled once in 1800, thejast jubilee year,
we stand amazed at the staunch Islanders’
marvellous servility —at the strange longing
of that strangest of peoples, the Biitish, to
kiss the foot that kicks it. In one sense, of
course, it was as ivell that our grandfathers
were filled with gladness when told that
their dull ruler had chastened them for
forty-nine years. It diverted their minds
from the fact that they had little with which
to fill their stomachs.
* * *
The Mayors came. They came clothed in
their robes of office, sparkling and scin-
tillating in the hour of of their pride.
To find a procession equalling in irridescence
that which zigzagged towards the Sydney
Town Hall a couple of weeks ago to
thank the Creator for having endowed
the reigning sovereign with a hearty
appetite and a sound digestion, we must go
back to the world’s morning twilight and
observe that droll crowd streaming out of
the stranded vessel yonder, and pouring
down the mountain side. It is the Ark they
are leaving, and the wear and tear of clothes
during their long confinement has given fine
scope to the play of fancy in the matter of
dress. Motley is the prevailing garb, with
here and there a bold innovation in sheen of
colours where the requirements of propriety
demanded uncompromising patches. Beside
some of those who the other day came among
us to jubilate, Solomon at The summit of his
glory wris but an unkempt mgndicant. No
combination of shades was wanting, no
originally of design absent. The wayward-
ness displayed in hats alone invited and held
the public attention. Looking at those long
lines of happy officials it was impossible to
help feeling a glow of pride in one’s adopted
land, a calm conviction that at last the future
of Australia was safe. Used as our beloved
Queen is to dainty pageantry, it is not too
much to say that had she looked in upon her af-
-1 fectionate antipodean children the other day
the sight would have convinced her that the
spirit that dictates the Court Circular
lives and flourishes among us also.

The hundred and ten millions composing
the English-speaking people are settling
down into two great divisions—British and
American—and three sub-divisions, Cana-
dian, South African, and Australian. Al-
though the latter adopt the political patterns
of their Columbian cousins, they still yearn
for the social usages and sartorial eccentri-
cities of the little North Atlantic Islands.
Drop a Briton down beside a Cooper’s Creek
waterhole where he can run up a bark hut to
sell bad food openly, and bad drink pri-
vately. No sooner does he secure a com-
petence by the ingenious devices known
under the generic name of “lambing-down,”
than an inexpressible longing seizes him to
wear silk stockings, pumps and knee-
breeches, a refulgent robe, and a hat of
abnormal proportions and curious design.
Nor does his ambition stop there. Not con-
tent to emulate, a Mayfair serving-man in
shimmer, he sighs for some titular distinction
—some alphabetical prefix or affix to distin-
guish him from his obscure neighbours. This
will account for a little of the luminosity
which dazzled admiring citizens at Mayor
Young’s late reception. One might travel
from St. Petersburg to Madrid, from Maine
to Nevada, without meeting such a prismatic
display. What wonder that the hearts,
throbbing under such resplendence, beat
wild with the desire for a closer union with
the mother country, for the health of the
august lady whose wisdom and profuseness
were proverbial, and for the creation of
loyal knights to stem the muddy tide of
Democracy an I teach the lower classes their
places ? This brings us to the speeches.
” * * *
Staunch little Tasmania sent a representa-
tive in ruffles and sword, lace and velvet, to
tell of her devotion. As he reached the
platform it was felt that the seventeenth
century greeted the nineteenth. A titter
went round. The innate vulgarity of some
of our so-called “leading” citizens is de-
plorable. Contemplating with calm scorn
the crowd of middle-aged females whence
the unseemly mirth seemed to proceed, the
Mayor of Hobart said “ he was proud to be
able to say that no more loyal colony than
Tasmania existed in the British dominions.”
This assurance was received with acclaim.
It restored confidence and quite dispelled
the whispered apprehension that Tasmania
was indifferent. Men breathed more freely,
looked in each others’ faces and smiled as
they felt that the Empire was safer. But
was it wise to keep the public mind so long
strained I The question may appear ungener-
ous now that all fears are at rest, but—to
continue. Bowing with exceptional grace,
Adelaide’s Magistrate observed : “In South
Australia they were endeavouring to do what
they could to bx-ing the colony prominently
before not only Australia but the whole
world.” This speech, too, secured approval.
For in view of the recent bank and penal
records of that colony it could not be denied
that the Adelaide people were on the right
track and only required to persevere in order
to reach notoriety. The Mayor of Welling-
ton (N.Z.), by touching on the sacrifices en-
tailed on those matrons whose husbands
serve the State, caused much anxiety, but
subsequently restored serenity by adopting a
more cheerful vein. He remarked :
“In the pursuance of their municipal duties
they very often had to neglect their wives and
keep them up late at night waiting their return
from meetings. . . . The Queen’s reign itself
had been at once the most glorious and happy and
prosperous that, so far as he could learn, modern
civilisation had ever witnessed. They had all
great reason to be proud indeed of their relation-
ship with the vast Empire over which their
sovereign ruled with so much goodness and
ability,”
It is doubtful what course would be best for
ladies to follow whose husbands are liable to
stay out at night. We have a natural re-
pugnance to offering advice in a question of
such delicacy. In the hands of a robust
woman we have known an umbrella to do
good. Speaking generally, however, the
plan of keeping spirits in the house is worth
a trial.
* * *
We have left the Mayors of Sydney and
Melbourne to the last. Mr. Young asserted
“ they were proud of their Imperial relation-
ship . . . They gave assurances of this
constant loyalty and affection to the Crown
and Royal family. ” Mr. Stewart (Melb.)
said :
“ Love and reverence for the person of their
Queen, loyalty to her throne . . . and an
underlying determination to remain an integral
portion of that empire were the characteristics
not of any one but of all the colonies of Austra-
lasia. If anything could give Her Majesty
pleasure on the approach of her jubilee year it
must be the satisfaction of looking out on her far-
off subjects > . , a free, a happy, arid a loyal
people, under her wise .and beneficent reign.”
It is difficult to read such opinions with-
out a smile compounded of pity and
derision. They are the opinions not
of Australians but of Englishmen, and
will no more represent the views of
a federated Australia of ten or twenty
millions than the loyal American assurances
of 1755 resembled those of twenty years later.
When this continent becomes sufficiently
populous its “ undying determination” will
be not to be a province of an em-
pire but an empire itself—to be com-
plete mistress of its own destinies, and
brook no interference from outsiders.
When that time arrives the answers to such
speeches as those delivered by Mayors,
Stewart and Young would probably be
discovered in the nearest horse-pond. The
English who have to pay a million a year to
support a number of useless foreigners in
idleness are beginning to i ntertain views
upon Monaichy quite different to those of
Anglo-Australians who have to pay nothing.

their predilections it is by no means

PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Political Gomorrah.
The Parliament of New South Wales is prorogued
What does the expression mean to those who «r«
conversant with the shameful history of the
session -the most disgraceful in the record of
Australian Parliaments ? It means that a lot of
hopeless boozers have staggeredrfor a season fr6m
the liquor-room of the Assembly to rant and rave
and soak and swill in places where their swinish
orgies will not inspire newspaper paragraphs
headed, “Another Disgraceful Scene in the As-
sembly’’ : it means that a herd of corrupt and
thievish libels on humanity will retire from the
public gaze for a time to work up huge jobs and
colossal swindles hereafter to be masked and
passed through the House : it means that a score
or so of public plunderers will depart for a space
to revel with the proceeds of successful frauds
already carried through to the end : it means that
a gang of tricksters, whose political liie is sus-
tained only by the foul garbage floated down by
the waters of sectarian tiife, wilt retire to
plot and plan insidious assaults on the ad-
herents of another faith : and, lastly, it moans
that a few honest; but, in the main, in-
capable, men will be released for a time 'from
compulsory companionship with sharpers, bigots
hypocrites and scoundrels. It is only with men
of the last class that we can deal seriatim. To
allude to a single political thief by name would
simply be to add a profitable libel suit to his as-
sets, therefore we are restricted in ! our personal
criticism to the honest men of the Assembly. And
they are a choice collectively, no
meaner, weaker, or more incapable Ministers ever
sat than those in the present Cabinet. Sir
Patrick Jennings’ own performance during the
season is comprised in a dreary record of weak
vacillation and still-born proposals, and his repu-
tation for veracity has failed to endure the con-
tinual assaults made against it by his own con-
flicting and contradictory statements. Mr. Dibbs,
as lieutenant to Sir Patrick, is worthy of what
honour he can get out of the billet, just as Sir
P atrick is entitled to ail the honour obtainable
from the services of such a lieutenant
And over the rest of the Ministerial crowd the
shadows of past sins and weaknesses darkly falls.
There is Mr. Lyne, chiefly notorious for his
brawl with the burly Clarke ; Mr. Fletcher.
whose unseemly occupancy of the portfolio of
Mines while ho continues to be largely interested
in mining, has long been a political scandal ; Mr.
Copeland whose physical vigour has been some-
what impaired by dyspepsia and lumbago ; Dr.
Renwick, whose foolish boast that he would con-
trol Mr. Dibbs seems t;o have gone the way of all
brag ; and Mr. Garvan,; whose wonted
force and ability have been conspicuously absent
since he descended to office —thbse men all seeming
to have a natural affinity—the affinity of incapa-
city, and to be capable colleagues although
miserably incapable Ministers. And some of
their supporters are like unto tliem. Milburn,
Creek Baker, once kicked out from the House-
already ; Vacation Coonan, just returned fromi
a starring tour in the provinces ; H. 11. Brown,.
whose support has been most noticed since-
his partner landed in a little alleged forgery
trouble ; Andrew Lysaght, whose offence in.
striking Mr. Gibbes would be more easily pard.on.ed,
if he had hit him harder; and Joseph Abbott,.
whose timeserving tactics seem to argue against
the existence of his alleged ability— these are
among the supporters of the Jennings Ministry..
Yet mean and “multy” as his crowd, is> it is
difficult to see what would be gained by kicking,
them out, for their probable successors would be,
meaner and “multier” still. Wisdom, Garrett,.
Davies, Neild, Henson, would be among the
probable successors, and it is difficult to imagine
the possibility of a crowd politically. lower than
these men. It is hard to see how deliverance
from her present miserable position can come to.
New South Wales. There are only two grounds-
for hope : one, that a political Cromwell may.
arise from among the present members ; the other.-
that the electors, profiting by the iesyn they have,
been taught by the recent session, may taka am
early opportunity of preventing drunkards,,
hypocrites, swindlers, log-rollers, and vote-thieves,
from again entering the House.
A Cleric on Divorce.
Canon Selwyn, in a letter to the S." M. Herald,
has added his mite to that pyramid of stupidity,
selfishness, hypocrisy and prejudice which has
been reared by the opponents of Sir Alfred
Stephen’s Divorce Bill. It is hardly necessary to
say that the Canon argues on Scriptural grounds
alone —no cleric ever does otherwise. He put®
forward one solitary text in support of his views
and then sits down as contentedly on top of his text
as a spaniel on a dust heap, convinced, apparently,
that he has crushed his enemies as the Philistines
were crushed by the jawbone of old. “ Whoso-
ever marrieth her that is put away committeth
adultery,” says this stern ecclesiastic, and on
the strength of these words he would refuse aid or
sympathy to the woman who finds herself wedded
to a brutal, drunken tyrant; or, if the law comes to
her relief, would brand her as a pariah, and place
her outside the paid of womanhood. The Bible,
according to Shepherd Selwyn, is sufficient
authority for this monstrous injustice because its
decrees arc just throughput; yet strangely enough
the verse on which ho i dies contains no command-
ment forbidding the divorced man to marry
again. In most cases he is the offender, and yet
so far as can be gathered from the gospel accord-
ing to Selwyn he may make 1 a woman’s li' e a h® l
upon earth, then.force her to seek refuge in the
Divorce Court, and afterwards leave her with a
lifelong curse upon her head —a curse which
as absolutely prevents her from again becoming
a vvi e as if she were a leper or a condemn 6
murderess, while he may choose another farm®
and consign her to the same ruin without violat-
ing the moral law. The Bible, as expounded by
bishops and clergy, becomes the invariable
weapon of the strong against the weak; it 1
made the organ and advocate of tho brute, tn
drunkard, the wife-beater, and the wife-murder ®r.
and meanwhile the sleek divines who seeming l !
cither know not or care nor, for tho daily, hour),
miseries of their unhappy sisters, sitintheircomfo r "
able drawing-rooms and groan out“ Iris the wm


the Loard.” But the people of Australia have
become weary of seeing the perpetual cruelties
which are committed under the auspices of such
scripture as this ; they fail to see Why the woman
who has been mated with a monster should suffer
perpetual exclusion from domestic life, not
because of the wrongs she has done, but because
of the wrongs she has suffered; and if this
Canon and the howlers of his tribe maintain that
such atrocious brutality is based on Scripture law
so mucli the worse for the Scripture and for them.
They are paid high salaries, and sit-; in hgh
places that they may expound God's law, and
when they thick-headediy exert themselves
iu the direction of preying that their
Gon is a monster and Ida laTwma. -.code
of outrageous, unreasoning dire
dung die Devil’s work, and doing it well. The
question of divorce will be settled in accordance
with the dicta) es of reason, and whether
Canon Selwyn argues from the Bible, the Koran,
or the Talmud, the result will be the same. His ver-
sion of the Scrips ure might he valued a'little more
highly if the clergy iu general would obey another
junction which says, “ Soli all that thou hast and
give m the poor,” but the peculiarity of iiutiy a
modem parson is that he hunts up all the texts
which will help to make life a burden to others,
and cat es not one solitary swear fur those which
promise to make things disagreeable for his holy
self. Canon Selwvn, by the way, omits to mom ion
that divbrce has already been sanctioned in Aiis-
tralia; that divorced men and women do marry
again ; and that there can bo found clergymen
who grab with a comprehensive claw the
fees which these marriages bring, thus selling
their gospel and their consciences for a £5 note.
And, judging from what we have seen of the
latter they are uncommonly dear at the price.

More Pence.
The Melbourne Argus is troubled about the
contributions to the Imperial Institute —the pro-
posed contributions to the proposed institute —for
it should be remembered that the whole affair Is
as yet An the realms of conjecture. .Nothing has
been done—it may bo, nothing ever will be done—
for' the Institute has been hooked on to the
Jubilee, and the Jubilee being altogether an affair
of.personal attachment to the Queen (quite apart
from reasonable loyalty to the throne), the
contributions will he, as the Argus admits and
insists, the measure of the attachment of the con-
tributors to that distinguished and venerable lady.
It is only a penny a head, moans the Argus,'
after figuring out the proposed contributions of
some of the colonies. Don’t you care more than
a penny a head for the Queen ? In answer, and
with a multitude of whose companionship we are
by no means ashamed, our reply is—No, we don’t
care a penny, or the sixteenth part of a
penny for the Queen; we should consider
ourselves guiity of, unquestionable wrong if we
expended the least portion of our poor substance
in such a way. For it is a wrong way and a
foolish way—it is turning even the ancient order
topsy-turvy. The old way, in colonial phrase,
was for the King to shout.” His dad should
“shout” for the people when he was born, he
should “ shout” himself when he put the old man
underground, and if he had the marvellous luck
to keep head on shoulders and crown on head
for fifty years he should get behind the bar and
S3i vc out drinks ti all hands while the liquor held.
But iu these degenerate days the Crown remains,
and all the fine oid hospitable duties of the Crown
seem to have passed away. Her Majesty does not
propose to “ shout ” at all, and we must “shout” an
institute for her to perpetuate her name and
generation, or at least tack them on for a little
longer to the disintegrating fabric of the empire.
How new and yet how rotten is the notion, how
mean, how characteristic, how Guelitiic,
' 10 true to the house of Coburg, to the
,poor Dutch blood just dashed with Stuart
; licentiousness, hut lacking the faintest
■ symptom of its broad generosity, its kingly grace !

A Religion of Ritual
There is fuss and fury among the Anglicans of
Sydney. Heal religious zeal has been aroused, and
those of them wno perchance were apathetic be-
fore have now been inspired with 'the desire of
making their voices heard in the councils of their
Church. From the Strange fierceness with which
the struggle rages, from the vehemence with
which charges of deception and trickery are
bandied about, uninstructed onlookers would
think that some vitally important questions were
at issue ; .but yet after all the whole point is as to
whether a gaudy piece of upholstery, to be stuck
up somewhere in Sk Andrew's Cathedral, should
or should not have some sculptured figures and
symbols upon its panels. It is, after all, merely a
question of church millinery which is now in-
volved, yet strangely enough such a contention is
the only thing powerful enotigh to rouse the reli-
gious bodies of to-day out of their apathy and
indifference. Men whose anxiety to keep any of the
commandments was never a subject of comment,
suddenly find that they cannot worship sincerely
while fellow-saints are tempted to the commission
of idolatry by the exhibition of ideal figures.
Others discover in these now ornaments a dis-
tinct advance towards the religion of Rome, while
supporters of the new church decorations aver
that the service is incomplete unless such things
are on view. Yet ifi all this there is nothing mar-
vellous and nothing new. The religion of every
denomination has become degraded into a matter
of ritual and empty form. The Church of-Rome
differs, from the Anglican Church in points of
doctrine and points of ritual only : to alter the
ritual is to alter the church. So the Pharisees
differed from the Sadducees : they wrangled over-
points of doctrine, they hated each other because
of their different fashions of worship, hut the
members of either sect showed equal skill in the
oppression of the poor and weak, and in the rob-
bery by legal means of the ignorant and distressed.
Their faith was dogma, their worship fashion, and
their lives deserving of the compiehensive
denunciations they received from the Great
Teacher of the Gospel of Love. Yet in spite of
those denunciations, Pharisaism never died out.
It flourishes to-day with greater vigour than ever
it formerly possessed ; the old-time phylactery is
represented by the modern white-choker, and the
Pharisee of this generation, heedless of the endless
opportunities for the application of the regenerat-
ing Gospel, is roused to action only by the plan of
a reredqs, the length of a vestment, or the use of
a symbol. And yet there are still some guileless
people who wonder why the influence of modern
churches is not sufficient to banish vice, poverty,
and misery from the four corners of the land.
The wonder rather is that in spite of the shadow
of such alleged religions, virtue and happiness
should be capable of any enduring growth.
The Lord Mayor’s Show.
The London Socialists are going to “ demonstrate”
on Lord Mayor’s day, and announce their inten-
tion of joining in his lordship’s procession. The
police, it is cabled, have intimated to the Socialist
leaders that the latter will be held responsible
for any disorder which may ensue. The costly,
cumbrous, useless “ show ” of the Lord Mayor,
with its concomitant evening gorge at the Guild-
hall, costs thousands of pounds, ihe wasteful ex-
penditure of wlnchis, under present circumstances,
a crime that calls aloud to God for vengeance.
Let the Socialists, say wo, follow in the train of
vulgar magnificence—let gaunt penury and un-
employed hunger walk in the wake, and trample on
the heels of careless wealth and of selfish gluttony.
We have more than once seen the show of the
Lord Mayor of London, and know it to he a
spectacle which, though it may fascinate the truly
“ common ” herd, and satisfy the soul-cravings of
that bourgeoisie which is everywhere the bitterest
enemy of the workman, is as vulgar and as tawdry
as arc the silken trappings of the harlot. The Soci-
alist leaders can well afford to take all the responsi-
bility attendant on the institution of a comparison
between Gilded Apoplexy and Starving Labour.
♦
The same old Policy—Suppression.
If one wants to find the drift of Sydney Herald
policy it is no use looking to the leaders. The
only way is to find out what the paper suppresses.
By this means we have discovered that the organ
of Jbfferis has now twisted round in favour of
the Jennings Ministry. Last Friday s issue gives
proof of this, for all answers to questions tending
to cast suspicion upon Ministers are carefully
omitted. These include the facts that James
Beattie, formerly coachman to the Premier, has
been worked into a nice little billet of £l5O a year ;
that Mr. Lyne has recently furnished a bedroom
at the Works’ Office; that Mr. Vindin, said to be
brother-in-law to the very-much-relatived J. P.
Abbott, was paid £Bl7 salary and travelling ex-
penses in one year ; that Mr. C. J. Lyne, brother
of the Minister, has been ‘ temporarily ’ appointed
to a position worth £3OO a year ; and that Mr.
Sydney Dibbs, holder of a billet in the Customs,
over which G. R. Dibbs presides, received (uinual
increments of £lO and £2O to his salary on Istt
October, 1881, and Ist April, 1885, respectively.'
As it happens, the strongest support that cah ; be
given to the Jennings Ministry is by suppression
of ail record of what they say and do, and, there-
fore, the Herald in going so far on this policy of
smother is to be applauded for its unusual success
in achievement of its aims. Generally, Herald
advocacy means instant andeertain condemnation.
But the triumph obtained in this case must he
somewhat marred by the reflection that the cause
is such that it can best be aided by a conspiracy of
silence.

The Pastoral Land Sharks.
For acumen and covetousness the pastoral lessees
of New South. Wales are a class unique and
unrivalled. When in years gone by they could
obtain leases of a whole county for a. song, they
set up a prolonged howl for fixity of tenure, and
this in 1884'was conceded. Their leased areas
were divided. One-half was retained by the then
holder for a fixed term, the other half Was taken
by the State. Divested of one grievance the
squatters immediately got others; they com-
plained that the rents were too high, and that
they were allowed no compensation for improve-
ments. Then their acumen found scope. They
worked f up a mew-b'orn syynpathy with the
labourers in the pastoral districts, and alleged
that if compensation were not allowed no improve-
ments would be effected, and distress of the
labourer must ensue. Then they got up a
gorgeous manifesto and advertised it in the
country papers. And they obtained gbdd
lecturers and sent them forth to agitate. All
these means were effective. The advocacy of the
labourer s interest was dust in the eyes of many of
his class; the fat ad. in the provincial Press was a
profitable douceur, and the lecturers boosted
along the cause cleverly. The full result of all
this is, that a Bill has been read a "econd time in
the Assembly, and now stands postponed to next
session, framed to secure this tenant-right. Both
j astice and policy array themselves in opposition
to the demand. lu the Western district whence
tae outcry comes the lessees have a tenure of
15 years, and improvements now effected will
have fully paid for themselves during the cur-
rency of the lease ; the lessee, therefore, who now
makes tanks and dams will have been recom-
pensed for his outlay before he is called upon to
meet competitors for his tenancy. To exact
compensation—“ not more than the original cost
thereof,” as the Act cautiously provides—would be
to pay the lessee double his outlay, and justice can
never demand that. And wit h rega rdt o public policy
it is necessary to look to the certain effect of this
Amending Act. To the squatters it will simply
give a freehold of their runs. Aided by the
Banks, which already coutroi millions of the best
acres of the colony, “improvements' will be
effected, not yet, but before the end of the term,
which will raise the cost of the run to an incoming
tenant to an exorbitantandpiolu office fig are, so that
t rm after term lessees will continue in possession
till they collectively grow strong enough and rich
enough to obtain the freehold in reality. And this
concession would extend indefinitely the system of
bribery which has ever obtained with regard to
the valuation of pastoral holdings. At the present
time “tip” in many districts. is unblushingly
given and as shamelessly accepted ; hut with com-
pensation as proposed there would be double
bribery : the incoming and outgoing tenants,
in dealing with a corrupt valuer (and the
percentage of such is distressingly great), would
each present their In tie testimonials, and so the
devil of corruption would rage with more
vehemence than ho has even 3et raged. These are
the main reasons why such compensation should
not be allowed. To pretend that it is similar to
tenant-right in England and Ireland is absurd.
Compensation is asked for there because the
tenants have not the power of obtaining return
for the outlay necessary for their occupancy:
here the case is decidedly otherwise. If the cost
of tanks and reservoirs is not covered by their
return within 15, or even 10 years, it must be that
they have been built, not of necessity, but as a
bar against competition when the run is again
submitted for lease. Injustice and corruption,—
these would be the immediate and prolific fruits
of tenant-right in this instance; and these are
also sufficient reasons against its concession,
*
Plundering the Loan Funds
It was once a pleasant fiction of Now South
Wales politics that loan money was all spent in
reproductive works. Since the introduction of
the Dibbs system that has all been changed, and
now the loans are plundered to make matters
easier for the Revenue Account. Thus,one of the
savings announced by Sir Patrick Jennings was
£20,000 on the vote for Bathurst gaol; now,
months after, when the money has been spent, it
is discovered that this sum was taken from Loan
Account and that the boasted saving was a pure
fiction—whether intentional or not we cannot say.
Other plans of retrenchment are possibly similar
in execution. Among these same loan items are
“ rolling stock, £580,000, railway stores, £300,000,”
sums which should certainly come out of railway
revenue. It is always the policy of the Minister
for the time being to make the railway figures
show a good return, hut plundering the Loan
Fund to this extent for that purpose is nothing
short of political dishonesty. The additional rolling
stock Will depreciate in value every month, and”
the stores can be consumed only once, therefore
the amounts should certainly have been debited
to working expenses. To charge them thus is as
unjustifiable as it would be to use loan monies in
payment of wages, and the railway returns for
this year must be utterly fallacious to the extent
of the votes thus improperly made. Of other
items on the list not one-half of the total sum can
be counted as reproductive in any sense of the
word. Gaols, bridges, and sewerage—these
absorb a very large proportion of the total, and
less than £1,000,000, one-third of the vote, can
ever be expected to return anything like the
amount of interest yearly demanded in future.
Which means that a fresh burden of £lOO,OOO a
year has been added to the vast load which the
New South Wales taxpayer already has to bear.
At the Merchant Taylors’ banquet to the Rev. F.
F. Goe, Bishop-elect of Melbourne, the latter is
reported to have said that “the menacing aspect
of some of the European powers may render Eng-
land glad of help from the colonies. He advo-
cated Imperial Federation.” Of course he did.
As we pointed out when this Bloomsbury Bishop
first condescended to show in Melbourne for £2OOO
a year, his sympathies ai e entirely English ; and
if he can assist in degrading Australia to the
position of a province of the Empire he will cer-
tainly do so. Foreign governors, lords, bishops,
and parsons—these are the traitors to Australia.
It is about Time the patriots of this continent arose
and starlod kicking with a stern determination
not to leave off until the last of the gang were
/lifted across the wafer.

New and highly flattering portraits of the

a suggestion of hair made on the top of his head

prominence of his eyes and rotundity of hia
stomach reduced, while the pretty Princess is
represented with rounded bust and features that
do not exist in the original. Wales is too plump

A bit of Australian natural history—how
they catch cockatoos down Murrumbidgec way.
They wound a cookie and tie him down on his
back. His yells soon attract all the cockles
within 50 miles, who come to his assistance.
They fly to him and walk about on his prostrate
carcass with a view of liberating him. Sooner or
later he catches hold of one with his feet, which
are ceaselessly clawing the air. There is not the
least fear of his letting go again, so the trapper
calmly walks up, releases the new captive and
ties him down on his back, so having two traps in
operation. This is repeated till all the cookies are
captured. It is an impressive sight when about
25 are tied down and about 100 fluttering over
them. With the feathers flying and the shrieks
and yells it is like a snowstorm in Hades.
Editor Bulletin.—Sir, —ln a recent
issue you refer to Mr. Kavanagh, formerly a
member of the Commons, stating that he was an
*■ engaged, young man when he met with an acci-
dent necessitating the amputation of his four
limbs.” Allow me to state that the accident oc-
cnrredlong before Mr. Kavanagh’s engagement, in
fact long before he was born, for at his birth he
was found to be minus his four limbs, or, rather,
the greater part of them. When I met him in ’63
he had been many years married, and had’ a
family of sor 6 children. One stump of his arm
(the left, I think) was about six inches, the other
about 3 inches, long, and these he used with great
effect. A bold rider after hounds, (until he gave
up the chase upon the death, by a very. simple
accident), of the Marquis of Waterford, a good
penman, and an excellent carver at the head of
his own table, he was a great example of perse-
verance in the face of difficulties and restless
energy combined. Some few years since I had
correspondence with him, and was surprised at
the excellence of his writing. He navigated his
own yacht in the Mediterranean, wrote a book on
his voyage, made an impression, in Parliament,
and lately was one of the moving spirits in a land-
lords’ protection association in Ireland. He owned
vast properties in three counties—Carlow, Kil-
kenny and Wexford —but has been unable to get
elected for the last tw® or three Parliaments Last,
but perhaps not least, his wife (the daughter of a
clergyman in Co. Louth) was a very handsome
woman. — Yours truly, A. J. T. — Brisbane, October

The Melbourne Herald publishes a thrill-
ing yarn about a man who had a “ Death Vision ”
of the Caulfield Cup. The circumstances under
which this individual obtained his peep into
futurity are described with a minuteness which
onvinoes us that he must himself have been a
Herald reporter, and the historian of his own
last moments. Who but his own inspired self
could have thrown off this sort of “ copy ?”
“ There were but two occupants of the room, the
soon-to-bc death chamber, the kind y doctor, and
the sick man upon his couch. The serene silence
was only broken by the heavy breathing of the
latter. The hour of midnight chimed, and almost
instantaneously the emaciated, gaunt figure upon
the bad rose with supernatural agility, and renting
himself upon a wasted elbow (with the usual im-
providence of a reporter, he had even wasted his
elbow), fixed his eyes upon vacancy, and in sepul-
chral tones, as if coming from a distance
exclaimed, ‘Doctor, do you bet?’ ... I see
Caulfield. They are starting for the Cup ; they
are off ; and with eager interested gaze the dying
man surveyed the room, as if watching the horses
in their career around the course. Suddenly he
exclaimed, ‘Aha! as I thought, Mick O’Brien
wins !’ and fell back lifeless.” That is the story
which the Herald states “is reported to be
authentic.”

business only commenced with the sixth and final
round. O’Donnell, who stands six feet, is cer-
tainly a fine young fellow, and towered over his
comparatively small opponent, but nevertheless
he came off second-best. The amateur struck
him heavily on the jaw several times, and once
landed his terrible left on to “the mark.”
O Donnell was very weak at the finish. Once the
men closed, when O’Donnell accidently bumped
the amateur on the nose.

What with little “ turns up ” in Macquarie
and King streets, the M.P.’s think it worth while
to brush up their athletic “laming.” No less
than seven of • them were at Foley’s on Saturday
night.

Some good fighting was also gone through
at Dooley and Seymour’s Hall. Seymour and
Fogarty went through four heavy-hitting rounds
without anything to choose between them at the
finish: and the next best was between Mulholland
and Parkes, the latter being clean “ knocked
out ’ in three rounds.

Sailing men had “the bulge” on the rowers
on Saturday, a heavy south-wester making heavy
work of it for the latter. The Balmain Sailing
Club brought off a Hurry-scurry race, for which
s jme thirty boats faced the starter, many of them
capsizing before Goat Island was negotiated. The
winner turned up in Mr. Fitzhardiuge’s Adelphi,
which must have won a host of trophies since she
fell into her present owner’s hands. She was built
many years ago by the late brothers Langford to
the order of Mr. Makinson, who christened her
the Miilgoa. Until Mr. Fitzhardinge became her
o wner she was looked upon as a slow knock-about
pleasiire boat, and no greater example of what
handling will do for a boat can be adduced than
Mr. Fitzhardinge and the Adelphi. The two
crack 20ft half-deckers, Nereus and Genesta, had
a spin on Saturday, when the beautifully-finished
Nereus finished ahead, but the Genesta could not
have shown her true form, as she is far and away
the fastest boat of her class in t he harbor.
Mr. Brickwood Colley will ride Malua in
the Melbourne Cup. After losing the Caulfield
Stakes* John O. Inglis declared he would ride the
horse again himself in B the Cup, but wiser counsels
have since prevailed, and he has determined to
put an artist on him. Brickey has now a chance
of getting home first in the hugest handicap in
the southern hemisphere.
•* * *
Isonomy’s easy victory in the Moonee
Valley Cup practically removes all suspicion that
hi defeat of Malua in the Caulfield Stakes at
weight for age was a fluke. John Hill, who
trains Isonomy, was not at all sanguine of success
—indeed, so little was he impressed with the
horse’s ability to win that he choked off a large
per ventage of his Adelaide friends, including
Charley Mann, Crown Prosecutor of Adelaide,
Billy K. Simms, the rich brewer, and many
others.

Mick O’Brien, who rode Ben Bolt to vic-

Before Abraham “ went macoolah ” over
Ben Bolt’s victory in the Caulfield Cup his Helrow
brothers swore by him. He could do nothing
wrong. Now, however, things are different, and
nothing too bad can be spoken of him, some of his
detractors being men who have breakfasted on
hominy, dined gn hominy, supped on hominy, and
slept on well, not a spring mattress.

Since the arrival at Flemington of Trident,
the yiddisher portion of the Melbourne betting
nng have never ceased praying for his welfare.
One of the tribe recommends his being fed on
mo‘r:a puddings as prepared by himself. Another
suggests a month’s rest, as “de poor ’orse ” has
done too much work; while a third displays
an amount of ingenuity in proposing -that he
should be sent to the stud immediately, purely
for the improving of our thoroughbred stock, and
not from any selfish motives, oh dear no. Ex-
cellent ideas indeed, the more so because they are
free from any sinister motives ; but would it not
be far wiser for them to deputationise Mr. White,
and obtain that gentleman’s permission to hold an
“at home” with Trident on the eve of Derby
Day?

A great fuss was made over the Javelin
episode a while hack. The papers want to know
' why the owner was not disqualilied, and the only
answer suggested was that they couldn’t find the
owner. Javelin, you know, was one of those very
intelligent horses. You would see him any time
; in the paddock saddling himself, and then he
would stroll round taking the odds and telling his
friends whether he was “on the job” or not.
He gave his jockey all his own instructions, and
persistently refused to win unless he had backed
himself well —oh, a very queer horse he was. Jso
wonder they can’t find the owner.

Eleven jockeys having come to grief, and
some of them having sustained serious injuries at

hand, which must now total considerably over a
thousand pounds, but we cannot remember any
unfortunate jockey having received relief from
it. Some deserving cases must have'cropped up
since the Fund was started, but perhaps the
policy of the A.J.C. is to do good by stealth, aud
thus save themselves from blushing.

“ The Sorcerer” shook his gory locks at
our representative at Sydney Royal on Saturday
eveniug. The house was crowded, but most of
the people went out for drinks between the acts
and we are inclined to think that Messrs. Gilbert
and Sullivan also went out for drinks when they
were preparing the opera. We almost wish they
had stayed out. The piece is a good one as com-
pared with that blown-up scarecrow, “ Billee
Taylor,” but contrasted with “ The Mikado ” the
new opera look-i only fit to be seized by the legs
and have its head knocked against the wall. The
story commences with the introduction of an
affectionate military mule who is about to be
married, and an affectionate young lady who is
about to marry this mule. The hero, in the ex-
cess of his happiness, desires to extend the hind
leg of cnarity to the whole village and hires a
respectable and old-established sorcerer to dose
the natives with love-philtres. The aspect of this
wizard scatters the happy illusions of our boyhood
in one act. According to all precedent he should
bo tall and stately, with a long, white beard, and
dressed in flowing robes, but instead of this, he is
distinctly and offensively stumpy; he wears a
1 mg hat which is tipped back wa 1 d sin a rakish, beer-
and-gln drinking sort of way, a loose coat,
and a white waistcoat, and he has more ‘ * h’s ”
in a sentence than there are in all Parked
Medication Hact. He deals in prophecies, witches,
and knells, can recommend his three-and-sixpenny
horoscope as a thoroughly reliable article, and his
Abudah chests, each containing a patent hag who
comes out and foretells disaster, with spring com-
plete, are unrivalled. The gre it speciality of the
firm, however, appears to be the penny curse,
which is much esteemed. An extremely small
prophet, too, is kept on the premises in St. Mary
Axe, where the resident Djinn attends on cus-
tomers. and trusts by courte<y and strict attention
to business to merit a continuance of the public
patronage. This slope-hatted sorcerer arranges
to supply a keg of the patent oxy-hydrogen, lovo-
at first-sight philtre with 25 per cent, off for cash,
and proceeds to prepare a brew in a large teapot.
He places the receptacle on the ground and
win ops into the darkness at one side of the stage
and then screeches into obscurity at the other,
while ghosts and hags answer to the call like
parrots shrieking from under a feather bod ; then
he jumps over all the furniture, walks round the
teapot, first on one leg, then on no log at all, turns
a somersault crushing his plug hat on the floor as
he turns, and yells amid crimson blazes, and a
beastly chemical smell. The incantation being
thus completed the dose is administered in tea, and
the whole population falls with a comprehensive
flop on the stage,
* * *
As the natural result, everybody falls in
love. A stately baronet hitches on to a widow of
the washing, ironing, and starching description ;
the widow’s daughter becomes attached to a
snuffy, dry-rot lawyer, aged 67 ; the sweetheart
of the affectionate military mule passes on to an
ancient clergyman ; and the individual who
Drought about this hideous disaster by investing
m a cask of love-philtre takes refuge in a curse of
Ids own, compared to which the sorcerer’s cheap
and reliable blast of Sheol and his patent spring
hag sink into insignificance. Lastly, a lady of
high degree falls in love with the wizard him-
self, and that cheerful necromantic dawg, who,
a little while ago, was j limping gaily round his
enchanted teapot, shudders when she a-iks,

asR USn^ ess Sydney Alhambra is about
o°iumg .as they make it in Australia. It is a
iderful little show, aud yanks in the dollars
better than a “ Wales ” testimonial, a railway
fraud, or a jubilee institute. It is not the home
of high art or aesthetic drama, but humour of a
substantial and consoling kind is ever on hand in
gratifying quantity. And the audience seem to
become imbued with a species of reckless rollick-
ing abandon which predisposes them to an ex-
treme enjoyment of “ the good'things provided”
—this latter phrase we use in defiance of the
Evknooze whose copyright property it is.

W. B. Warner, lately returned from
Brisbane, lends his energies to boost things along,
and succeeds a mervzille, for his business is
exceedingly familiar to him—as it is likewise to the
big majority of his audience. Without wishing
to disparage Mr. Warner’s present performance
we may yet venture to hint that there are some
newer songs in the market than quite several of
those he sings. Miss Nina Tulloch warbles with
fetching effect, her “Moses and Aaron’’ballad being
like unto a cyclone or a bomb-shell, for it always
brings down the house. Miss Amy Rowe appears,
to our admiring eyes (for we are bright and shiny
where once auburn locks had their habitation), to
grow younger every day, and the sisters Pullen
more beautiful. Miss Edith Wilson irishjigs in
style which goes far to prove the current a
rumour that she was weaned on buttermilk.
Itiley Brothers dance, Matlock sings, and Frank
Smith smiles with peculiar beauty and eloquence,
and these things being so the house must
necessarily maintain its pristine popularity.

Harry Rickards and Co., at the Sydney
Academy, unwilling perhaps to hurt Garnet j
Welch’s feelings by taking off his production, con-
tinue to run, or rather kick along, “ Bric-a-Brac ”
to the modified rapture of moderate audiences.
Yet we are free to admit that there are some very
respectable persons by whom the humour of this
entertainment is beloved and applauded. When,
for instance, Mr. Rickards alludes to a very much
made-up butler, who is familiarly admitted to the
family circ’e as a “ rorty old funeral purcessiou, j
the remark is wildly applauded, and a similar
fate attends his address to the nigger footman—
also admitted to the family circle at Wattle
Grange—whom he calls “ me ton of best-screened
Wallsend.” Possibly there may really be much
humour in “ Bric-a-Brac,” if so it is, and will
we hop) ever be, our misfortune to be unable to
succeed in its discovery. With regard to the
songs, the programme was completely changed on
Saturday last.

The Faust Family are now tenanting the
Sydney Gaiety for the faust time for quite a long
while. They are a company of many excellences,
and many peculiarities. Willie Faust’s mouth is
of the latter order ; it is his chief facial beauty, in
fact his only one, no face yet constructed being
capable of holding another feature without un-
seemly crowding. About the best item rn the
Family’s programme is the marble statuary
business. Dressed in classic style, made up to
resemble marble, and bathed in thick bright lime-
light the actors pose in exquisitely designed groups
with such effect as to curl up the post-office
carvings with incurable envy, and poison the
heart of an alderman with the green-eyed monster
(you will notice that we have made metaphor our
special study). Mr. Bergin, a baritone of good
compass and some science, is with them : so are
Herr Von Der Mehden, the cornet soloist, and the
two Arrowsmiths, Willie and Pearl. The latter
reproaches some imaginary man with the fact
that he does not love her. This is probably
because she sang to him ; she would never have
to reproach us that way, for her voice is to us,
as interesting as a two million deficit, and a lot
more useful,

“ Ingomar ’’ the barbarian is finishing his
career at Sydney Opera House, and will die
deeply regretted by all who knew him, if only for
Parthenia’s sake. Miss Essie Jenyns, as the
Greek maiden, is as winsome as ever. Her father,
a limp and weeping dummy from the Mediter-
ranean ; her lover, the coughing, broken-backed,
broken-winded Polydor; and her spiderish mother,
all vinegar and spite and front teeth, only act as
foils to set off her attractions, and even Ingomar
with his booming laugh, his absent shave, and his
stately and imposing legs, is a secondary character
m comparison with the heroine. In fact Ingomar,
though Mr. Holloway plays the character tolerably
well, has dropped so much into the back-ground,
that he has little save his hair and his legs to
travel on, and iu the last act, when he is shaved
and civilised, he loses a good deal of his import-
ance. Shakespeare’s pastoral comedy, “As You
inke It) i s announced for Friday, and should be
veil received, especially as a good many people
are under the impression that a “ pastoral
comedy has something to do with the humorous
aspect of the frozen-meat trade.

In Rockhampton lately, while a diorama
was unrolling, a laughable incident occurred.
’Twasascene by moonlight, consisting of a large
lake surrounded by mountains. The moon in this
particular diorama begins to rise from the tail of
a cow lhat is drinking at the lake. While she
(the moon) gracefully climbs up the face of the
mountain, the lady at the piano sings “ The Moon
Behind the Hill.” “No, ma’m,” shouted one of
the audience—“you make a mistake; she’s for-

From N.Y. Mercury Once more the
cable reports that Minnie Palmer was married to
John R. Rogers at Dublin, on 13th October.”
A ghastly item. We gather
from a neat circular appro-
priately printed in blue ink that
the Sydney Philharmonic Society
is in extremis :—“ The com-
mittee regret to have to intimate
that the funds so far placed at
their disposal prove quite inade-
quate to continue operations
with any hope of giving four
concerts this season, as originally
intended; on the contrary, the
two concerts already given, with
the new music ordered, have
left a considerable deficit.” The
subscription-list for present
season has up to the present,
only amounted to about £5OO.

hope that the subscribers and
such of the public as have en-
joyed the benefit of free tickets
will raise the amount required.
But we are a little nervous over
the matter. Any hard-working
society which gives a good en-
tertainment for the pure love of
art can, if it sends round “ com-
plimentary ” invitations, get to-
gether a magnificent and
strongly-perfumed array of per-
sonages in elaborate dress-suits
and of other personages in still
more elaborate silks and satins.
But when the little guinea is
reqtiired to help the musician
who has amused the care'ess
crowd—that is nobody’s busi-
| ness. People don’t visit in prison the man
| whose champagne they have drunk, and it is in-
i convenient to remember the roast turkey and
I after-dinner Benedictine of your ruined friend.
And so it is with regard to the society which has
sung for you till it was hoarse.

At the Alexandra Theatre, Melbourne,
Phil,. Day is appearing as Dick Dolland, in Byron s
drama, “ Uncle Dick’s Darling.” It was written
some 17 years ago for J. A Toole, in order to give
the low comedian a chance to exhibit the
emotional power which he doesn’t possess. It has
j been revived apparently to provide Mr. Phil. Day
with the same opportunity. • The story is that of
a hawker who. aspires to make a lady of his
adopted daughter. He sends the little “ darling ”
to a fashionable boarding school—terms, 100
guineas per annum and extras—and when she is
“ finished,” hawker Uncle Dick takes her back to
his caravan and marries her to his nephew, a poor
but honest young man, who wears no waistcoat
and dispense? with braces. That is the story.
But three quarters of the play are devoted
to Uncle Dick’s dream of what would happen if he
allowed his darling to make a match in accord-
ance with the wishes of her superfine school-
mistress. The dream depicts the darling as a
fashionable young woman of the Mrs. Crawford
type married to a Mr. Chevenixand “carryingon”
with the Hon. Claude Lorrimer. She comes to
grief, and poor Uncle Dick dreams himself into a
broken heart, long white hair and' eyebrows of
abnormal bushiness. This is the dream which
decides the benevolent hawker against a fashion-
able alliance for his adopted daughter. It
is a foolish dream entirely. A less impossible
creature than Uncle Dick would have had quite a
different-coloured nightmare. He would have
seen the accomplished boarding-school miss turn-
ing up her nose at the poor, but honest, husband,
and playing waltzes qn the piano when she ought,
to have been peeling potatoes. However, the play
can’t be altered now, because H. J. Byron is dead.
Mr. Phil. Day scarcely, adds to his reputation in
the character of Uncle Dick. In his merry
moments he is amusing but slangy. There is a
thm monotony about his pathos. He doesn't £ive
one the idea that he is in earnest. We remember
the original production of “ Uncle Dick’s Dar-
hng. The principal? were Toole, Irving (Mr.
Chevenix), John Clayton, and Adelaide Neilson.
1 he only member of the Alexandra Company who
r>?.^f 0ac k es performance of his predecessor is
1 ’ ® ay '. iss EUa Claiborne has a light
comedy voice which alone is enough to-disqualify
her for tearful parts. Of the others, Mr. Fred,
btanmaur is a passable Chevenix, and distinctly
reminded us of Irving in the first act. There was
a strong resemblance between the patterns of
their respective trousers—if we remember rightly.
Ihe drama is excellently put upon the stage and
finds favour.

Notwithstanding that the pretty little
town of Grafton is positively to be let (applications
to be addressed to the banks), the mighty Edith
O Gorman, alias “ Escaped Nun,” seems to have
scooped in over a hundred guineas during her re-

is considerably better business than giving up
your money and all chance of making money, and
tramping round in a rusty black gown to visit
the pick.”

The Nymagce publicans and the Nyuiagee

A Gippsland policeman has committed
suicide. Before blowing out his distracted brains
the “ bobby ” wrote a memorandum asking that
the manner of his death should be kept dark from
his parents, and that they should merely be in-
formed how he went off happy and quite ready for
eternity. These last instructions have been faith-
fully carried out by the daily papers.
A heavily-insured London house has been
set on fire by the explosion of a bottle of milk. It
is thought chemical changes took place in some-
thing eatt-n by a heavily-insured cow and a kind
of dynamite was thus produced. This opens up a
new and terrible source of danger. Even the
baby may now be loaded, and spanking that sweet
ipnocent may result in the wrecking of half a
suburb..
At Perth (W.A.), a ticket-of-leave man
was lately “ run in ” for being out at a quarter-
past 10 on Saturday night. The unlucky indivi-
dual who holds a “ ticket ” in that colony must
not even go on his own verandah after 10 o’clock,
and if he puts his head out of the window after
hours to “ shoo ” a hen in his front garden he is
liable to work in the iron-gang for about three
months.

in another pub. the vice is versa.

Mr. William Miller alluded to the loquacious Boy
Politician as “ that fiend Caulfield!” Alderman

ing that Premier Jennings was the Castlereagh of

the other statesman, ho had not yet cut his

According to the Sydney D.T., at the
opening of St. Andrew’s Chapter-house on Monday
afternoon, Lord Carington said “ I have been
asked to suggest that in case any person has for-
gotten their purse I shall be happy as chairman to
receive any promises of subscriptions which any
lady or gentlemen may be pleased to give.”
Surely to goodness, His Excellency, as guardian
of the Queen’s English, said nothing of the kind ?
Certain political oracles in Sydney who
would seem to have some authority for their
opinion, assert that Lord Carington would really
like to be able to mistake D.T. leaders and-the
speeches of Messrs. Hawken, M’Kinnon, Martin,
and Co. for “ the voice of the country.” In that
event, it is thought, he would disregard the or-
dinary constitutional practice and dissolve the
House against the advice of his Ministers. We
cannot think that Lord Carington—anxious though
he very possibly is to do something notable—
would risk so much. His Ministers would be
bound to resign if their advice were disregarded,
and if their party came back victorious from the
country, he would be compelled to ask them again
to accept the offices which he had forced them to
resign. ' '

The rector of Norton-in-the-Moor (Eng.)
displays a marvellous clerical ignorance of the
ns and outs of “ kiss in the ring.” He is such
an unsophisticated child of light as to tell his
flock that “it passes his understanding how any
modest maiden can allow boy or man to come and
kiss her as part of the game.” The maiden
allow ! Great Scott ! On behalf of that sterner
sex which is often more kissed against than kiss-
ing, we will rectify the rector in a doggrel :—■
The Melbourne Herald' (an aesthetic
evening journal of the Noose family) protests, in
the interests of morality, against “ the advent of
a cheap and noisome literature.” The Herald,
bless its little heart! —considers that “ to the
eager perusal of a most pestilent species Of cheap
reading may be traced much of the exceptional
crime which is a feature of the times. . . .
Hide by side with the publication of blood-curdling
fiction, and sty'll worse (O, most just judge!), of
newspapers devoted to the narrative of hideous
outrages, a kind of mimetic frenzy seems to seize
upon the weak and criminal classes of society.
. . . Turn which way we may, we find people
making fortunes by the publication of literature
which panders to morbid tastes and vicious pas-
sions. It gives us downright pleasure to reprint.

A NEW INDUSTRY.
“BACK FROM KIMBERLEY.”
these copious and touching extracts from a penny
paper which has doubled its circulation during
the past three years by a strict attention to hang-
ings, floggings, and miscellaneous social ’trocities.
Only quite recently we referred to the case of a
Melbourne man, who “ went for” his missus in
the proud hope of “ doing something for her which
would make the Herald sell better than when
the Kelly gang was captured.” If the aforequoted
article had only appeared earlier, that ambitious
ruffian might have spared himself a crime which
was distinctly inspired by a pestilent species of
cheap reading. No matter-better late than never.
Now that the'leading horror-monger of these
colonies has started a crusade against “ noisome
literature,” we shall expect the Sydney Nooze to
assist it in holding the mirror up to virtue. It
will soon be possible to lay out our evening penny
in Sydney or Melbourne without blushing.
their daily reports of “shocking suicides,” hor-
rible disclosures, and the like. “By the side of
the ill-fated man,” says one of the recent free
ads., “lay a nickel-plated revolver, which
he had purchased the day before from Messrs.
Ballcartridge and Cos., and which, like all
the articles sold at that establishment, did its
deadly work only too well.” As the rosy little’
game trets better known, we will probably read that
“ the bullet entered just under the breast-pocket
of his marvellously well-fitting coat, which was
made in Messrs. Snip Brothers’ best style, and
his seeks were evidently new, as they still bore
the well-known and popular trade-mark of the’
famed Balbriggan House.” Or maybe we’ll hear
that, “although the dastardly ruffian struck at :
the head of his victim repeatedly, (still such was
the wonderful firmness of his bat, which came
from the unrivalled emporium of Castor Cadie and :
Cos. that it resisted every blow, and to its efficacy
the wearer undoubtedly owes his life.” Thus will
the fame of pur tradesmen be Wafted from Car-
pentaria s rocky mountains to the Yarra’s smell-
ful sands, and thus will the level-headed reporter
be enabled to deprive two birds of existence by
means of one brick.

The very latest pill-and-ointment testi-
nionial. On a certain N.S.W. station a man fell
into a vat of boiling tallow, and before he was
hauled out he had been cooked from the waist
downwards. His mates rushed for a prayer-book
with a view to giving the sufferer some ghostly
consolation ; but they could only find a fragment of
one; still, regarding even that as better than
nothing, they commenced to read the prayer which
invokes a blessing on Albert Edward and the rest
of the Royal Family. But luckily them 'was one
practical man in the crowd, and just as the service
was proceeding gaily he appeared with three
bottles of Boshliar’s ointment, and yelling, “ To
with the Prince of Wales,” he proceeded to
dress the sufferer’s wounds and bandage them
with sheepskin. Then he administered a pint of
rum internally, and left the patient in peace to
await results. This was 12 months ago, and at
last shearing the unfortunate man returned eight
pounds of good crossbred wool. He would have
given more but for the drought.

The breed of European kings is improving.
Ihe late lamented Ludwig of Bavaria used to
think he was a double-headed eagle j and now he
has passed his delusion on to his successor, King
Otto. This gentleman has long wished he were a
bird, and ho has now started, cackling,' under i he
impression that his desire has been realised. He
has also built a nest of straw and dry leaves in his
apartment and is looking round for some eggs to
hatch to keep the family from becoming extinct.
His subjects, however, are loyal to* the last, and
some of them even wish Otto to assume the
government that he may cluck on the Bav arian
throne and greet foreign ambassadors with a
cock-a-doodle-doo. Socialists and other depraved
people, of course, object to be ruled by a monarch
who wants to lay eggs and insists on roosting on
the back of a chair instead of going to bed, but
they don t count for much in South Germany ; the
Boards Anointed is .still boss of the situation.
The Anointed, by the way, has now retired into 1
seclusion for the moulting season.
The “Gamp” as it is Played.
Rector, thou has never played
In some verdant woodland glade
At kiss in the ring,
Else thou woulds’t not wonder how
Maid can manhood’s kiss “ allow
She does no such thing.
In a circle stand they there—
Bashful swains and maidens fair—
With a girl iri the middle ;
She affects a timid grace.
Tries to blush and hide her face
(For a girl’s a riddle).
All the young gazelles, meanwhile,
Frisk about in sportive style—
Eyes full of mischief ;
Round and round they singing go.
Waiting for their chance to throw
The longed-for kerchief.
All the fellows, hot and red,
Meek as lambs to slaughter led,
Try to look pleasant.
(Men to girls are one to eight
At these games, we beg to state.
When we’ve been present.)
Presently the crowd of girls,
Laughing shakos, its wayward curls.
While the one in the centre
Pausing here and pausing there,
With kerchief waving in the air.
Makes the chaps turn magenta.
Soon the maiden spots her “ one
In hot pursuit he has to run
To quiet, dark places ;
Till she thinks they’re out of sight,
Then she stops- the luckless wight
In her embrace is.
Slrephon’s trembling arm she grips,
Glues on his her ardent lips,
And droops her lashes ;
lie, pppr half-unwilling elf,
Doifit'know how to help himself—
’Tie the maid who mashes.
Rector, we have played that game,
And girls treat every chap the same
When once they’ve picked him ;
Pursuer be he or pursued,
The maidens feign that they are wooed—
The man’s the victim.
TOLD AFTER THE CUP.
(BY A BROKER).
On November 2nd in eighty-six,
The Leary Bloke and me,
We puts some brass in our saucy “ kicks,
And we goes the Cup to see ;
We both wore soots o’ slap-up checks
(I ’ad a light green ’at),
And was voted by all o’ the opposite sex,
The toffs o’ the Flemington Flat.
We takes our seats atop of a fence,
Does the Leary Bloke an’ me—
We ’as no truck with the small events.
But we waits there pationtlee—
Waits till the nags ’ad cantered by
(We’d laid out our bits o’ gold),
Bill shoves his glass to his hoagle eye,
And this is the tale he told,
“ They’re up in a line by the startin post,
Some thirty strong or more ;
They’re or/—at the first attempt a’most—
With Meteor to the fore ;
Then, in a cluster agin the rails,
Is Lesbia, Grace, Recall,
With Trident pullin’ like mad at Hales,
And Sheet Anchor last of all.
“ Ere they come, galloping up the straight—
A gallopin’ up like h ;
Don Giovan in front, with his nice light weight,
And Malooa a run n in’ well ;
Away past the lawn and the judge’s box,
Tho’ the battle ain’t arf begun,
Already a lot o’ them weedy crocks
Is a tailing away—clean done.
“ Round by the river it’s much the same,
The light weight’s still in front—
A cove in red, Lord knows ’is name,
Has dropped right out o’ the ’unt;
Away at the back here’s somethin’ in white
Come up with a orful rush—
The favourite keeps with his field all right,
And clear of the bloomin’ crush.
“ They’re closin’ up as they pass the sheds—
The Don and Recall are done ! „
I can’t see well, for the people’s ’eds—
Ah, now for the final run !
Little John, the Anchor, and old Ben Bolt,
Bohemian and Silvermine,
Trenton, Malooa, and the Derby colt—
It rests with some eight or nine.
“ Silvermine’s gone ! He’s under the whip—
The Anchor ’as cried a go !
Trident ’as given the rest the slip—
It’s all over now, you know.
A quarter o’ mile from homo the race'
Is over. What did I say ? *
Didn’t I say it ’ud be the case
When 1 saw ’im on Saturday ?
* Malooa ’as eased, ’ee’s got no show—
No'orse can't give the weight— f i j
It ain’t 'is game to be number two.
’Ere’s one come out too late !
Affluence, s help me ! with Sammy up—
He goes like a little bird-
lie’s second—but Trident wins the Cup,
Little John is a decent third.” - -i

Alexander was a willing actor, and was paid a
good Stiff price for playing his part. The un-

tailor from his yacht in the Mediterranean, de-
siring the head of the firm to come out and take
the ducal order. The firm’s travelling expenses
brought the Duke’s coats up to about £lOO apiece,
more or less. When this £30,000 account was
sent in to the executors of the crazy duke it was
promptly paid, and the joy of getting such a fear-
ful weight off his mind sent the poor tailor mad.
Berry, the British executioner, recently
hanged Mary Ann Britland, and not having her
photo, he wrote the following letter to the Ashton
Chief Constable: —“Sir, —I would take it as a
favour if you would send me a carte-de-visite of
Mary Ann Britland, the Ashton poisoner, whom I
executed at her Majesty’s prison, Strangcways,
Manchester. I did hear them selling outside the
prison, and 1 thought 1 should like one to put in
my collection of murderers whom I have hung oh
different occasions. I here with enclose you my
card, trusting you will send me one, or give me
the address of the photographer.—l am, sir, yours
faithfully, James Berry, Executioner.” The
Chief Constable duly complied with the request.
M. Chevreul, the great French chemist,
ranks as the oldest scientist in the world. He
passed his 100th year last August, and has been
employed in the Jardin des Plantes since 1810.
He has lived under 11 governments —from that of
Louis XVI. down to the third Republic—and
remembers distinctly the hideous Reign of Terror..
During his long life he has neither drunk nor
smoked, and his diet consists almost entirely of
soup, beefsteak and coffee. During the Prussian
bombardment of Paris the Jardin des Plantes
suffered more than any other part of the city, but
M. Chevreul, then 85 years Of age, stuck to his
museum, and while the bursting shells were
scattering his collections he scrambled for the
wrecks of his cherished specimen?, and succeeded
m saving many of them.

The “military movement” is responsible
for one million pounds of the deficit in the N.S.W.
finances. Such is Jingoism, and such is glory !
All that the electors have got for that million is—

The Sydney D.T. wants to “go to the
country.” The French wanted to go to Berlin.
And they did go—as prisoners, like sheep in
railway-trucks. Which is exactly what will
happen to the N.S.W. freetraders.

Summed up, the political situation in
N.S.W. amounts to this : The present Ministry
took to the Protectionists to uphold their failing
cause. The Protectionists will probably be strong
enough after next general election to dispense
with the Ministry,
“ If there is one distinguishing trait in the
political character of New South Wales it is that
of a sublime and almost invulnerable patience)”
says the Sydney D.T. That is so. They haven’t yet
pole-axed Jawbone Neild, and it is alleged that
some people still read Sapphira’s leaders.
More Imperial Federation dogwash. Sir
Anthony Musgrave, Governor of Queensland,
thinks that if the Empire is not federated it will
ultimately be chopped up after the fashion of
Poland. But, as far as we can remember, Po'and
was “ federated ” to death's door before she was
swallowed up.
An argument very commonly urged
against payment of members is that it would
degrade Parliament. This objection can: hardly
apply to the present N.S.W. Assembly. To
attempt to degrade that “deliberative” body
would be as futile as to try to cool the North Pole,
or to warm Rockhampton.
The Railway to Ryanslattery, we mean
Burrowa, found an advocate in Harold Acraman,
the crack amateur N.S.W. light-weight. He says I
that nobody there would be benefited by a rail way
but the cockles. No —but there’s something about |
cutting up big estates into farms that makes us
think Aoraman’s Beverley property might possibly
be on the market if they got their line.
The head office of the N.S.W. Telegraph
Department is in anything but a satisfactory state.
A strike is inevitable unless some measures be
taken to put a stop to “ political ” promotions. It
is not right that useless operators should draw fat
salaries and look on with a benign .Anile at men
getting about £l3O a year. The Melbourne and
Brisbane lines are manned almost solely by men
getting £l3O and £175.
During 1885, N.S.W.’s output of coal was

tons. Since 1872, the colony has exported 91,921
tons,_yajued 934,808. Last, year the export
of copper ' was only"oI92 tons; owing £6 low
prices drought, which brought the output
down to 5746 tons. The increase in the yield of
silver for the year represents £139,407. Forty-

Mr. Blaine to ask whether Head-Constable Magee is to
be retained,at Armagh, notwithstanding that his relations by

M'ss Duffy, now employed as a telegraphist at
rati ick s Well, will soon be promoted.
Home Rule is becoming necessary whether the
people ask for it or not. If the chief council of
the empire is to keep one eye on Constable Magee
and the other on Miss Duffy, what is to become
of the rest of the 300,000,000 people whom it is
supposed to look after ?
“ The following generous offer,” says the

“By law or otherwise ”is good. We guess it
will generally be otherwise—very much other-

The Orange members of the
N.S.W. Parliament have received

There are said to be a num-
ber of very urgent reasons why
Sir Henry Parkes should get into
office—and into the salary attached
thereto —at the earliest possible
moment. But there don’t seem to
be many reasons why the people
should shove Parkes into office and
salary, though it might be a grace-
ful act to give him a salary to stand
out.
The N. S. W. Permanent Ar-
tillery has been reduced from 500
to 350 men in order to get rid of
what the officers term the, “ incor-
rigible and worthless ” characters.
Thirty per cent, is a very decent
proportion of these, but still it is
better than the Ministerial average.
In the Assembly 95 per cent, are
worthless, 89 per cent, are incorri-
gible, and 70 per cent. look like
born fools. We have not had time
to add up these figures, but we will
take our solemn affidavit on a
blown-out match, or a cracked
saucer, that they are perfectly
accurate.
Certain of the papers glee-
fully published the account given
by Mr. Wisdom (per medium of a
so-called narration of proceedings
in the “Burglarian” Parliament)
of recent events in the N.S.W.
Assembly, But when Ninian Meh
ville, continuing the parable of the
hon. member for Morpeth, added
that the “Burglarian” Parliament
was constantly annoyed by a cer-
tain member whose habit it was to
get very drunk, the daily papers
found it convenient to burke all further reference
to the wrangle.
A great salt-water grovel is in contem-
plation in Sydney, and the cash is to come out of
the Soudan goat and donkey— alias the N.-S.W,
Patriotic —Fund. Of that “ Patriotic ” subscrip-
tion, which amounted to over £30,000, 85 per cent,
is still unexpended, and as many of the donors re-
fuse to receive back their cash outpouring, a cer-
tain Mr. Fairfax urges that the money should be
spent in building a comfortable home “ for the
men of her Majesty’s navy while they remain here
to protect our shores.” It might, perhaps, be
better laid out in providing homes for poor
emigrants who have been lured to “ our shores ”
by lying, misrepresentation, and all manner, of
official and miscellaneous perjury, and then, left
to starve in the Sydney Domain or to wander
homeless and hopeless over a bleak and poverty-
stricken land ; but the Soudan goat and donkey
grovellers make small account of these victims-
In deeds and words they tell them to “ starve
and be hanged,” for no Australian ever yet got a
K.C.M.G.-ship by doing justice to the poor.

At Wyndham,’Northern Territory, they
have a new gaol, and for many weeks the local
beak could find no One to put in it, but at last he
gave a sinner a three months’ term, and felt
happy. Then it was suddenly discovered that it
was not all joy to own a gaol and a live criminal.
It was necessary to have a governor if discipline
was to be maintained, also a turnkey to obey the
governor’s order?, and a surgeon, and a chaplain
to look after the morals of the depraved convict,
and in the absence of all fotir tliey had to tell the
prisoner lie had better go and do his sentence on
horseback, in the open air; or any way he liked
best. But the criminal insisted on staying to ex-
piate his offence, and accordingly he has to cook
for himself and be his own chaplain and his own
governor, and all the rest of the staff, and a new
regulation has been made that if he is not in at
9 o’clock every night ho will lose all right, title,
and interest in the gaol. Several friends who are
in low water have offered to take the rest of his
sentence for him, but the Spartan prisoner declines
all such temptations.
A Dream of the Melbourne Cup,
A LONG WAY AFTER GOADON,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bring me a quart of colonial beer
And some doughy damper to make’good cheer,
I must make a heavy dinner;
Heavily dine and heavily sup
Of indigestible things full-up,
Next month they run the Melbourne Cun,
And I have to dream the 'winner.
Stoke it in, boys! the half-cooked ham,
Ihe rich ragout and the charming chain,
I ve got to mix my liquor ;
Give me a gander’s gauntj[hind leg.
Hard and tough as a wooden peg, i
And I’ll grease it down with a ham-boiled egg,
Twill make me dream the quicker.
Now I am full of fearful feed,
Now I may dream a race indeed,
In my restless troubled slutnber ;
W bile the night-mares race through my heated
brain
And their devil-riders spur amain, :
Ihe tip for the Cup-will re ward my pain,
And I’ll spot the winning number.
Thousands and thousands and thousands more
Like sands on the white Paciflc’shoye,
The crowding people cluster'; ’ 1
For evermore it’s the story old,
While races are bought and are sold
Drawn by the greed of the gain of iold, ’
In their thousands still they muster.
And the bookie’s cries grow fierce and hot
‘ I’ll lay the Cup * The double, if > not! ”
4( Five monkeys, Littlejohn, sir!”
Here’s fivers bar one, I lay, I lay ! ”
And so they shout through the livelong day,
And stick to the game that is sure to pay.
While fools put money on, sir !
And now in my dream I seem to go
And bet with a “ book ” that I seem to know-^
A Hebrew money-lender ; f
A million to five is the price I got—
Not bad ! but before I book the bet
The horse’s name I clean forget,
His number and even gender.
Now for the start, and here they come,
And the hoof-strokes roar like a mighty drum
Beat by a hand unsteady ;
They come like a rushing, roaring flood,
Hurrah for the speed of the Chester blood !
For Acme is making the pace sti good
There are some of ’em done already.
But round the back she begins to tire,
And a mighty shout goes up “ Crossfire !”
The magpie jacket’s leading ;
And Crossfire challenges fierce and bold,
And the lead she’ll have and the lead she II hold.
But at length gives way to the black and gold,
Which away to the front is speeding.
Carry them on and keep it up—
A flying race is the Melbourne Cup,
You must race and stay to win it;
And old Commotion, Victoria’s pride;
Now takes the lead with his raking stride,
And a mighty roar goes far and wide—
“ There’s only Commotion in it!’’
But one draws out from the beaten ruck
And up on the rails by a piece of luck
He comes in a style that’s clever ;
‘ It’s Trident! Trident! Hurrah for Hales !
“ Go at ’em now while their courage fails
“ Trident! Trident! for New South Wales!”
“ The blue and white for ever!”
Under the whip ! with the ears flat back.
Under the whip I though the sinews .crack,
No sign of the base white feather;
Stick to it now for your breeding’s sake,
Stick to it now though your hearts should break,
While the yells and roars make the grand-stand
shake,
They come down the straight together.
Trident slowly forges ahead,
The fierce whips cut and the spurs are red,
The pace is undiminished ;
Now for the Panics that never fall 1
But many a backer’s face grows pale
As old Commotion swings his tail
And swerves—and the Cup is finished.
* * *
And now in my dream it all comes back;
I bet my coin on the Sydney crack,
A million I’ve won, no question !
Give me my money, you hook-nosed hog !
Give me my money, bookmaking dog !
But he disappears in a kind of fog,
And I wake with “ the indigestion.”

To a Sydney Civil servant who is an amateur
gardener and knows a jackass from a turnip when
he has a Chinaman to help him, a “friend” gave

and planted it carefully. He has also watered it
regularly and means to watch over it with
tenderest care.
WHITE HANDS AND BROWN.
Soft white hands, they rule the world.
The world they never fed ;
They garner the harvests they never sow,
And dole out the ploughman his bread.
Dainty and fair these hands have grown,
Folded in silken sloth ;
For they toil not, neither do they spin,
But they always measure the cloth.
Soft White hands are lined with gold,
And covered with finest of kid,
And there never was lack of tongues to tell
Of the kindly deeds they did
They are given to “ prificely charities ”
Flinging the bare picked-bone
Back to the beggared working man's child—
A tithe of what was its own.
Yet hard brown hands behind it all
Keep up life’s engine-fires ;
The strength that is stole from their stinted brain
The statesman’s thought inspires.
They fight the bat tie t luit.others plan.
And find in the spoil no share ;
The wealth of the world thro’ their brown palms
pass,
Yet leaves them empty and bare.
O hard brown hands, go carry the hod
And level the forest down,
And hold your badge of toil as dear
As a king his jewelled crown.
Work on in patient honesty, ~
Hope on, and Heaven speed
The day when hard brown hands shall rule
The nations that they feed.

“The Thief of Time."


Society
On Thursday, last week, Lady Caringtoh’s
At Home, at Government House, Sydney, was
hampered hy a charge of one shilling for enti’ance,
because the Horticultural Society were holding
their show in the Inner Domain, through which
one has to pass on the way to the vice-regal abode.
The cause for sorrow lies in the fact that the
money did not go to help out the Jennings de-
ficiency as it should have done, but we hope to
see matters better arranged next time. At the
present crisis surely the aristocrats of Potts Point
would not object to pay even half-a-crown to see
her ladyship if they knew that the money was
going to help their bleeding country, the tariff
should therefore be imposed at once. Season tickets
at reduced rates but not transferable, to chorus-
singers. barmaids, and young ladies who, up to
their elbows in the wash-tub all the morning, are
on reception afternoons up to their necks in glory.
Children half-price.
* * *
The price of admission on opening-day to
the Haughty-cultural Show, at Sydney Inner
Domain, was fixed at half-a-crown, which many
people paid out of a loyal desire to gaze on and
brush skirts with Lady Carington. The figure
had been set at that splendid sum so as to restrict
the company within reasonable and fashionable
limits; in this, however, the device was but
partly successful, as the restriction was so ex-
clusive that many well-known leaders of fashion
were unable to be present. This should be re-
membered on future occasions if it is really
intended that aristocracy and not more mammon
is to be the test of admission : those who are
really the “ best ” people in Sydney can’t afford
half-a-crown. The opening ceremony took place
at the hour when all good people go to luncheon.
Lady Carington was received by Mayor Young,
who presented her with a bouquet which she
smelt twice, and then declared the show open.
Her ladyship was about to continue her speech,
when an enthusiastic M.P. shouted Out, “Three
cheers for the Queen !” and thus the rest of Lady
Carington’s words are lost for ever. The visitors
then spread themselves through the pavilions and
began smelling all they saw and much that they
didn’t,
* * *
As a flower show, the affair must be
accounted a miserable failure, inasmuch as
though space had been provided for enough
flowers to represent this flower-growing land, only
sufficient were sent to make the tents look empty
and desolate. Great gaps between the pots and
plants showed the white canvas of the walls, and
long wooden benches with perhaps a few pansies
at one end and a spectator or two at the other,
made the scene still more ghastly. However,
some of the exhibits were excellent, the roses
being very fine indeed.
* * *
London Life, commenting on the failure to
raise a testimonial to “ Wales,” mercilessly re-
marks : “ The scheme was to all intents and pur-
poses still-born, for, except among the ignorant
natives of India and the lower classes of Colonials
among whom the thing was energetically pushed
by the officials, it was only recivod in a half-
hearted way.” Considering that Sir James Martin
helped to boost the thing along in N.S.W., this
allusion to the “lower classes of Colonials”’ can
be only partially atoned for by Niagaras of gore.
We have not yet heard how much the. eminent
Chief Justice has raked in. He does not boast
about the total collected—possibly because his
native modesty prevents him from publishing his
brilliant success as a collector of Imperial tip.
* * *
A Sydney club has gone wrong. Once
there was a club, also in Sydney, which, having
eaten itself into debt, determined, on the
suggestion of a certain old warrior of a knight, to
drink itself out again ; this effort, thanks to the
exertions of a number of bottle-nosed members,
was entirely successful. But, the members of
this last impecunious hash-house having drunk
themselves into debt, find that they have to eat
themselves out of the toils of Moses and Abraham.
A £lO “call” has been made on the members,
only about thirty of whom have responded ; the
committee therefore find themselves personally
liable for a deficiency of over £2,000.
* * *
A writer in one of the English society
papers asserts that, although male aristocrats arc
getting soberer with every generation, the ladies
are tending to an opposite extreme. He describes
female tippling as a social vice which is becoming
more popular every day, so much so that
confectioners, theatre-managers, and chemists are
extending facilities for its indulgence. Yes, and
we notice that quite a number of portly ladies take
their morning brandy and soda at certain fashion-
able Sydney restaurants.
* * *
The time is rapidly approaching when a
Sydney man about to furnish will buy a six-
shooter even before he purchases a corkscrew.
Burgling is quite common in the suburbs. A
masked man not long ago “ went through ” the
bedroom of Mr. Buchanan, S.M., in the dead of
night. Mrs. Buchanan awakened “his worship”
and drew his attention to the presence of strangers
in the house, but the bold burglar rushed down-
stairs, slammed the door behind him, and
as he, being an expert, had taken the
precaution to tamper with the lock, Mr. Buchanan
was unable until too late to got out of the house
and pursue him. And a week or two since a
burglar entered the bedroom of Mr. and Mrs.
Loughnan, at Woollahra, while the inmates were
asleep, and walked off with over £lOO worth of
jewellery.
* * »
A governess, who had been left a legacy,
bought with her money seven hundred acres of
mortgaged land in Fiji. The other day, in
Sydney, she tried to raise some cash on the title-
deeds, but on enquiry it transpired that when the
vendor sold her the land it had bden twice mort-
gaged, and she had no more claim upon it than a
yam. Ladies, when they dabble in business of this
kind, should be keener over it than when they are
beating down the Chinese vegetable-man at the
back door.
It is now the fashion in the very highest
sassiety of Sydney to extensively “assist ” the lips
and eyebrows. The fact was painfully evident at
last week’s rose show.

The romance fades at about fourteen
knots an hour when the awful silence of a fellow's
honeymoon is only broken by the hall-bell announc-
ing the arrival of still another dun. Under such
circumstances the bridegroom is apt to break into
language which makes the lights burn blue, and
the lady is found to think him a perfect
brute, and i o wonder what on earth induced her
to marry him at her time of life. When the next
daughter—if there is one—gets married the affair
won’t create quite such a stir in the best N.S.W.
sassiety. .. _

In the North of Ireland, lately, a girl and
her lover lately presented themselves to the priest
to get married. They had no money, and his
reverence suggested that the proceedings should
be adjourned for half-an-hour, during which the
happy pair might contrive to raise a small fee.
The girl straightway proceeded to the priest’s
house, and told the housekeeper that the reverend
gentleman had sent her for his overcoat. The
garment was handed to her, and duly pawned by
her with the local Israelite for 55., with which
she calmly paid the good clergyman.

The scene is Tattersall’s. Sunday News}
Bailey is present. “Well, it’s a blanked shame,
and we won’t pay,” said a metallician, “ the
starter had no right to let the horses go a furlong
before the post.” This was enough. The Are of
journalistic fiction burned brightly within its
grate, and the Sabbath-breaker, hearing, drew
his own conclusion. On the day of rest it was an-
nounced thatthe Caulfield Cup had to be run over
again, and a lot of people, merely by spending a
penny, bought for themselves a very miserable
Sunday.

WHY HE LOVED HER.
HE: “DO YOU PLAY THE PIANO.”
SHE: “NO, CAN’T PLAY A NOTE.”
HE: WHAT, NO! THEN I LOVE YOU—WILL YOU BE MINE FOREVER-R-R-R.”
Canon Gunther, of Parramatta, is not
happy. He has called attention to the fact that a
member of the Salvation Army married a lass
under 1(1 years of age, enjoyed slightly interrupted
bliss for two weeks, and then returned his bride,
with thanks, to the Benevolent Asylum. This
has raised the ire of the Canon—who seems to be
not so much annoyed at the girl being sent back,
as at the fact that a clergyman could have been
found who would perform the marriage ceremony
for one so young. But why not ? Have not the
sainted kings and queens been married by bishops
and priests at any age, even at the age of three,
and no Canon ever made the slightest objection?
And as for their being returned to a Benevolent
Asylum, we fancy the Buckingham Palaces of
Europe are nothing more or less, with the
exception of the comfort and the grovel.

Here is a marvellous fact, illustrative of
the utter rottenness of the N.S.W. military
system. The only increase on the military esti-
mates this year is in the case of Lieut.-Colonel
Spalding, whose pay has, for some mysterious
reason, been raised by some £7O per annum. We
can only presume that the advance is given as a
recognition of the services of the gallant warrior
who so distinguished himself a little while ago by
bringing unproveable accusations against his
isubordinate, young Lieutenant Airey. By the
way, isn’t it the etiquette of the Imperial service
for“a man*who ■irasrinadeisuch-oharges and failed
to prove them, to resign his commission ?

The Aldermanic Juhiloe of IVEsiyor Young
has been something very like a fizzle. Outside
the ring no interest whatever has been taken in
these persons’junketings and doings. John made
a mistake in asking them, and they made a m is

Miss Young, the Mayoress, a handsome present of

The Sydney clergy made a handsome show
at the Government auction sale of land at the
Field of Mars the other day—every leading
denomination but the Roman Catholic being
represented by one or two of “the cloth.” It is
satisfactory to find, that our little threepennies
mount up, and that, even after providing for the
necessities of the nigger in the New Hebrides,
our spiritual advisers have a “ bit ” laid by in the
stocking for the land-spec account. Earth-hunger
was written in the faces of the holy bidders, who
made things tropical for the unregonerate in their
endeavours to fulfill the prophecy that the meek
parson shall inherit the earth.

They do these things better in Persia. No
man thinks of murdering a wife of whom he is
tired, but he sends her as a gift to some bachelor
friend whom she has taught to admire her and
who is too courteous to refuse. The Shah sets
this example, and by this means his beloved
spouse of the time being is young, handsome, and I
loving, and his married life is a perpetual honey-
moon. There is no sewing up in sacks, no anti-
mony, no bowstring. The favourite cabinet minis-
ter or general is informed that’be Mil be favoured

“Dear darling, lam dying. Forgive me, 1

‘ ‘ The Governor’s footman was in clare
from head to foot”’ gushes a Melbourne paper. I
is satisfactory to notice that when the gorgeous
menials of Sir Henry Loch are “in liquor” theii
tipple is so aesthetically mild. By the way.thesicken
ing Governor-worship of the Melbourne peonle and
press has surely reached its limit. The other day
a man named Broom was run into gaol for “ in-
sulting behaviour,” his sole offence being that he
had, in his capacity as spokesman for the Mel-
bourne unemployed, insisted on addressing this
well-paid Imperial hireling while the latter was
“ in a hurry.”

A little pastoral poem was enacted the
other day on Howard Smith’s wharf, Brisbane.
A lady had resolved to elope with a new husband,
and was on th'? point of starting ; her two children
and the furniture were also eloping. At the last
moment, however, her lord and boss took her
ashore by her little pink ear, and there was a
tigerish scrimmage, the faithless woman being a
whale-like female of great fighting powers. It
was only at the end of the third round they ob-
served that the steamer was gone, and that the
vile deceiver was gone too, taking the furniture
with him.

It is not long since people were jocosely
warned that peril lurked in the celluloid plate on
which false teeth were grafted, and that the tooth-
brush with celluloid handle might explode and
dash out a careless person’s brains. Maidens were
warned to beware of the celluloid garter, and
ycung men in the habit of hugging their sweet-
hearts were properly impressed with the dangers
of collars and cuffs of the same material. But all
these possibilities are outdone by the actual death
(reported in the papers to hand by last American
mail) of a woman in broad day and in an open
street by the explosion of her celluloid “ improver ”
and the burning of her garments. It would be
ludicrous, if it were not so horrible. ,

One George Haynes has been sued by his
wife for support, and in his reply the unhappy
man sets forth that he only abandoned the domes-
tic altar when his wife insisted upon taking a
butcher’s knife to bed with her. He had endured
beatings in silence and had only gently protested
against the prongs of a fork being stuck in his
back ; but he drew the line at butcher’s knives.
The point seems to be well taken. A knife is an
unpleasant bedfellow, even when lovely woman
handles it. It is even worse than the pipe and to-
bacco, to which some unfeeling wives object.
What is a crying need of the hour, is a code of
matrimonial ethics which will specify where the
line is to be drawn in all cases. Sir Alfred
Stephen might with advantage make the formula-
tion of such a code the “ crowning work ” of his
career.

The Sydney ‘‘dailies” are quite excited
in re a female goat brought from the New Hebrides
by the crew of the victorious Opal, and now to
be seen on board that vessel by the curious and
patriotic. The capture of this wonderful animal
by the dare devils of the navy recalls the bloody
carnage attendant on the annexation of the
Soudan donkey. It is suggested that this last-
acquired trophy of valour shall be retained in the
colony and given into the custody of the Little
Boy at Manly. The Echo even goes so far as to
suggest that it should be “ judiciously crossed ”
with our own merino sheep. But if the colony
really wants to retain a lasting memento of its
military successes in Africa and elsewhere, why
not cross the Opal goat with the Soudan donkey
and utilise the offspring as chargeahs for the
Sydney Lanceahs ?
On Sunday evening, the 19th, the last of

During the progress of Mayor Young’s
Municipal Jubilee he got into some rather queer
company. On one occasion, coffee was being
handed round, and when the sugar-basin was
passed to a country magnate that individual took
a large handful in his dubious-looking paw and
dropped it into his cup. A pressman who was
looking on waited anxiously to see him stir the
beverage with his finger, but it was too hot.
Neither could he stir it with his boot, for that ob-
ject was much too large, so he was reluctantly
compelled to fall back upon the spoon.

A gruesome tale comes from the Swiss

flapped waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled shoes,

still remained in his pockets none bore a later date
than 1765. The body was frozen hard, and as it
lay in a cavern deep down in the icy pit it had
suffered no injury. Even the eyes preserved their
life-like expression, though they had been staring :
out for 100 years from that lonely cave as if look- j
ing for the relief which was so long in coming.
The Salvation Harmy is exhibiting some
preliminary symptoms of a general break-up of its
constitution. Not only in England is the sub-
scription supply running short and mutiny becom-
ing fashionable, but even in Australiat, he happy
hunting ground of cranks, the gilt seems to be
wearing off the Harmy gingerbread. Colonel
Barker is starting a “ Colony Thanksgiving and
Debt Extinction Fund” in Victoria. This sounds
ominous. It is the first muttering of the storm.
Ere long we shall be hearing of the bailiffs being
put into a barracks during knee-drill, and of un-
secured hallelujah creditors getting twopence in

A N OPEN SECRET.
C ome all you jolly shepherds that whistle through
the glen,
L et me tell you all a secret, some courtiers dinna
ken ;
A Scottish invitation that, just borrow’d for the
rhyme,
U nacknowledged theft of verse is a paltry sort of
crime.
S ummer's coming. It is, here. In a week at
most,
E very public in the country, every steamer on
the coast,
N ow arrivals, old colonials, of each the best and
worst ;
S oon will own the soft imp eachment of a forty-
dollar thirst.
L eather medals, bogus prize claims, don’t quench
that thirst at all,
A genuine honest drink is the one great earnest
call:
G ood for brain as well as body, bright, tasty,
clear, and good ;
E ach thirsty soul is hankering for that more than
food.
R ight queer are the dodges, right sorrowful the
jokes,
B orn of flat insipid beer, and the pains that it
provokes ; l
E very day that murmur rises. On the other
hand you hear,
E ach father, brother, husband, who keeps his
senses clear,
R epudiate all other brands for CLAUSEN’S
LAGER BEER.
WHAT SOME VICTORIANS THINK
ABOUT CLAUSEN'S LAGER BEER.
“HARDLY ANY OTHER ORDERED.”
Mr. William O’Neil, lessee of the Cathedral
Hotel, Swanston-street, Melbourne says:—“We
pronounce Clausen’s Beer a great success. All
our patrons praise it highly, and are discontinuing
all other brands in its favour. In our luncheon
rooms hardly any other beer is ordered. Its con
ditidn is very reliable; we have never met a flat
bottle, nor noticed any breakage.”
“A PLEASURE TO SELL.”
Mr. William Ramsay, of Phair’s Hotel, Collins-
street, says “ Clausen’s New York Lager Beer
is greatly appreciated by my customers because of
its sparkling condition and really pleasant flavour.
It is a pleasure to sell it, because of the approval
it meets with.”
“FINE QUALITY.”
Mr. John O’Hagon, of the Sandhurst Hotel
Sandhurst, says I And Clausen’s Ale of fine
quality, sparkling, and free from sediment. It
gives great satisfaction to all my customers.”
“THE MOST POPULAR.”
Mrs. Marion Lane, of the City Club Hotel,
Collins-street, says “ Without any reservation,
Clausen’s Lager Beer is the most popular bottled
I have ever had on sale. Every one praises its
brilliancy, lightness, and flavour, and the sale of
it is increasing daily.”
“ VERY ACCEPTABLE.”
Mr. C. Foster, of the well-known “George”
Hotel, Lydiard-street, Ballarat, says:—“The
general opinion of my customers about Clausen’s
Lager Beer is highly favorable. It is pronounced
to be very acceptable in flavour, and while it
possesses an appetising bitter of delicate purity
and excellence, and is as clear as champagne, it is
free from the sediment which generally chara-
terises much of the Lager Beer I have seen in,
Victoria.”
“THE FINEST LAGER.”
Mr. F. Wilkins, of that renowned old hostelry,
“ The Shamrock,” at Sandhurst, in forwarding a
large re-order for Clausen’s Lager Beer to hia
Melbourne agents, says “ This beer gives im-
mense satisfaction here, and is certainly the finest
Lager I have come across during my 20 years’
hotel experience.”
“FINE QUALITY AND POPULARITY.”
Messrs. J. and H. De Groot, lessees of the Rail-
way Refreshment Rooms at Seymour, say;—“We
have much pleasure in testifying to the fine
qualities of Clausen's Lager Beer, also to its being
the popular brand with the travelling public on
the North-Eastern line.”
“ GREAT SATISFACTION.”
Mr. W. H. Pavier, proprietor of the Dimboola
Hotel, Dimboola, under cover of a large re-order,
writes :—“I find Clausen’s New York Lager Beer
gives great satisfaction to my customers, being a
jight, mild, and clear ale.”
“PREFERRED TO ANY OTHER BRAND.’ |
From the Foresters’ Hotel, Stawell, Mr. J.
Gawley, writes : —“ My customers prefer Clausen’s
Champagne Lager Beer to any other brand in the
market, and they consider it the most suitable
beer for this climate.”
“ESTIMABLE QUALITIES.”
Mr. Robert Tyler, of the Union Tavern Hotel,
St. Arnaud, says:—“Clausen’s New York Lager
Beer is truly a beautiful, sparkling, andinvigorat
ing stimulant, having all those estimable qualities
found in the best English bottled beers. As a
beverage for invalids, it is invaluable, for it is so
mild that it can be taken without affecting them
in the least. Those who have tasted it hei'e speak
highly in its favour.”

It is all right for poets to sing the praises of the beautiful

the glassy ice, hut they can't till the bill with that sort of stuff
when one is sitting with his feet in a tub of hot water, his
head done up in flannels, and with mustard plasters on both
sides of his cheat. What a person needs then is a thorough
dose of Dr. Bell’s Bitters to act as a cathartic, for nothing
will so quickly relieve that congestive, feverish condition
which cornea of a hard cold. Often these colds cause bilious
attacks, lame backs, disordered kidneys, rheumatism, catarrh,

healthy condition.

A Good Remedy for a Cold.— On going to bed
take a dose of Freeman’s Chlorodyne, either in
water or camphor mixture. The diaphoretic action
of this excellent remedy speedily produces a
general glow, followed by a free perspiration, dur-
ing which the pulse improves in character from a
feeble to a full, elastic one, a good night’s sleep is
obtained, and on waking in the morning the cold
will be found to have dissapeared. The certainty
of the action of Freeman’s Chlorodyne is very re-
markable in Ague; it frequently prevents an
attack, or, failing this, reduces the violence of the
ague fit to a minimum. In many countries Free-
man’s Chlorodyne has entirely superseded the use
of Quinine, and in the tea gardens of India noth-
ing else is given for Ague and other forms of Fever.
Insist upon having “Freeman’s” only. Trade
mark, an Elephant,—obtainable from all chemists
and storekeepers.

expansion of our business, and the repeated orders
we receive from customers who dealt with us as
far back as 1882, are gratifying proofs that our
Goods and our method of doing business giv#
satisfaction.
We continue the same system. We buy direct
from the makers in London, Paris, and New York
all such Goods, Watches, &c., as are not the pro-
duct of our Company’s own works. We add a
fair and reasonable profit, and SELL FOR CASH,
thus avoiding bad debts, and steering clear of the
evil system of charging rates which compel paying
customers to make good the default of bad marks

will be paid to it. Payment can be made by Postage Stamp*
of any Australian colony up to £1 worth, by Oh .que at <9

case we do our beat to please and satisfy you.
On receiving the Brooch, or other article, if you don t entirely
like the pattern or style, write by first mail explaining in what
respect you would like it to differ—returning the Broooi W
the same good order as you received it —thereupon we Will
try again, and send a second one to same value.
Or, if you don't like the first Brooch at all, and want font
money back, v/e will send back the full sum, less the postal
outlay incurred.
We make this pledge in all seriousness, althbugh with
something of a light heart; because, although we have

THE LIVER IN THE SPRING.
The liver, located on the right side, below the
right lung, its lower edge being direct ly under the
short ribs, and-extending across te the left side,
is net only the largest gland of the body, but is
one of the most complex in its workings, and, like
a delicate piece of machinery, is easily thrown out
of order. Upon its proper action depends the
mental and ph sical welfare of the body. Any
one of the following symptoms indicates its de-
part ure from health
Symptoms.—Headache, sallow complexion,
gradually increasing constipation, disinclination
to exertion vertigo, d zzincss, highly coloure d
urine, a “splendid” feeling to-day, and a depressed
one to-morrow; pain under ei.tbei shoulder, and
under ribi on the light side ; neuralgia, pain of
chest, heartburn, indigestion, enlargement of side
below the ribs, dropsy of the abdomen, dry mouth;
brown, flabby tongue ; occasional chills, hot flushes
moth patches on the face, yellowish eyeballs, sick
headache, frequent vomiting of bitter matter ;
piles, caused by congestion of the liver; severe
spasmodic pain in upper part of abdomen, relieved
by pressure, h’enough, jaundice, c’ay-coloured
stools, sour stomach variable appc’ite. irritability
of temper, diarrhoea, dysentry, burning palms and
feet, dry cough, sleeplessness.
Tne diseases which are indicated by any of the
above symptoms are jaundice, gall stones, ei ■
largemeat, contraction, congestion, inflammation,
abscess, tumours, hydatids, catarrh, of the ducts,
fatty accumulation, cancer, malaria, and last but
not least, biliousness, which is so common in this
country with both sexes.
History. —Daring winter, Nature wisely arranges
that wo should live on foods containing much fat,
or, as they are known, hydro-carbons, for the
purpose of supplying he,at to the body; tho
chemical operation necessary to transform fat into
heat is (he exclusive work of the liver, and so
during the time stated it is constantly congested.
With the approach of warm weather our diet
changes to muscle-producing food, and the work
of the liver is much lessened. In the majority of
oases, however, it is unable to completely thx - ow
off the excess of bile, but remains congested, caus-
ing that lazy, tired feeling which many have in the
spring months, when the weather becomes warm.
This is evidence of an unhealthy condition, and
though people appreciate the necessity of an altera-
tive at this period, the common idea is to take
drastic pills and produce a cathartic effec’. only
to make matters worse The liver must be un-
loaded, and its proper action restored before ho’
weather, if you wish to preserve health, and if
this distinct call of nature is unheeded, serious re-
sults will occur. The b'ood will become loaded
with bile and lithic acid, arid as every drop of
vital fluid passes through the kidneys to be puri-
fied, they soon break down, and aro rendered un-
able to carry out the deadly poison.
Treatment. Warner’s safe cure and Warder’s
safe pills have not only a specific action on the
kidneys, but on the liver also. • They thin the
thickened bile so that it will pass out through its
duct*, and so enable the glands to unload them-
selves, act as a solvent on all biliary acids, and,
in a word, fit the liver for the season’s work, pre-
venting blood poisoning, inflammation, abscess,
and all affections to which it is so liable. As you
value the blessings of health, do not allow the
summer to approach without giving your system a
“general house-cleaning” with Warner’s safe
remedies. “To he farwarned is to be forearmed.”

THE JUDGE.
Mr. Jones,” said the Manager, with cold severity to
Accountant, while all the tellers and ledger-keepers pricier
up their ears at his tone and manner, “ The Inspector is in
my room and wishes to have a word with you.” When Jon*,
entered the manager’s room I e was followed by that offinn?
who carefully closed the door after him, there was a buzz in
the bank. ‘‘What’s Jones being up to?" "I always saidw2
fiddle with the securities, flist chance,” and so forth »
whispered round. ’
d'ones found the Inspector seated in awful state i n the
manager’s chair.
“ Your salary,” Mr. Jones, said the Inspector, referring to
some notrs "is £450 a year.”
“’lt is,” faltered Jones, who didn’t like the boss’s tone.
“And you have to maintain a wife and five children r
think ’ * 1
“Yes, sir.”
“Your eldest daughter is quite a grown-up young lady,
“Quite so" stammered Jones, growing red and pale Ira
turns. *
“ lam informed that you have no private source of income
Mr. J ODGS.
‘I have rot, sir,
“ Then, Mr. Jones, you will not be surprised when I inform
you that representations have been made to the bank, that
your wife and daughter habitually wear jewellery, when In
evening dress, of a class and costliness which is plainly in.
compatible with your means. I should like to know Mr
Jones, where you derive the money to purchase these beautb
ful and expensive articles I hear of. They can’t be family
heirlooms, for I have the best information that the designs
are m the most recent taste."
Poor Mr. Jones ceased to stroke the bald place on the back
of his head, and his eyes flashing fire, he retorted warmly
so you considered me a thief because my wife and mv
daughter wear such decorations os help to set off their a£
tractions. Do you think sir that your wife and your daughter
monopolize the right to such embellishments. Sir the
jewellery which sets off the lovliness of my daughter and the
mattoply dignity of my wife, to the point of exciting the
jealofis spitefulncss of your daughter and wife (for I under-
stand tiow whence you derive your information) is Oriental
Gold Jewellery. It is a a beautiful as the costliest articles and
yet its trifling cost enables my wife and daughter to appear in
the same society as yours without disadvantage and without
my being guilty of the thefts which you generously suspected
me guilty of. Your questions and your suspicions, your
manner and your attitude are alikv insulting. I tender you
here my resignation and I have to inform you that my
daughter iv next month to he married to Mr. Woolsworth
who has also asked me to accept the management of his
financial affairs, at a salary, sir, which your own manager
dock not enjoy I I wish you good morning, sir."
“Just to think,” grumbled the Inspector's plain, sour
daughter that evening when her father had told her the event
of the morning and stormed at her and her mother for placing
him in so false a position; “just to think that it's all owing
to that Oriental Gold being so lovely and so cheap. To
snatch young Woolworth from under my very nose too.”
