The Soft and Scented Hawks
A new novel by Wells is an adventure.
One opens it to find the latest aspect of the
modern world focussed by the clearest brain
in modern literature, to find new problems
raised and suggestively discussed, to glimpse
the meaning of all the tendencies of our
time. And if, as in The Passionate Friends
(Macmillan), Wells has failed to find room
for much of a story, the New Republican is
not disappointed. The stoty of this latest
Wells is certainly slight, but it is but one
romantic strand in the richest tapestry of
brave visions and constructive thought. It
is cast in the guise of the story of a man’s
life, written down by himself for the guid-
ance of his infant son—an intimate expla-
nation with a moral. Stratton, a parson’s
son, loves Lady Mary. She loves him.
Their early intimacy is the daintiest of
model idylls; but she could not marry this
practically pcmniless youth, and deliberately
took a great financier, making the bargain
that the marriage would be one only in
name. Some years afterwards, Stratton,
who has made his way through the war in
South Africa, meets her again, and their
early love awakens. They become lovers,
and on the discovery of their relations by
the husband t*he price Stratton has to pay
is his exile from England for three years.
In that interval he discovers the East, and
does useful spade-w T ork in the investigation
of the labor problems of the world. After
serving his term, he returns—and Mary
writes to him. He replies, though by this
time he is married. The price that Mary
had to pay he discovers then. She has had
two children. In this correspondence he
finds the missing need of his ego. But time
and distance lead ultimately to the end of
the correspondence; and then, by pure
chance, the passionate friends meet for one
day. This accidental and innocent meeting
is discovered by the husband, he naturally
puts the wrong construction upon it, and
there is the Devil to pay. Mary pays that
gentleman. That is all.
But the texture of this book is vastly
more important than this thin trickle of
incident. Wells has the faculty, unique in
an Englishman, of seeing the Englishman
exactly as he is. There are certain aspects
of that individual that stand out stark to
any Australasian that has the chance of
seeing him in his cage: the curious thing is
that Wells, inhabiting the same cage, should
so unerringly detect those qualities. He
writes of the Englishman with an Australian
aloofness.
Jt
The theme of the book is jealousy. The
thesis is that we must outgrow the mere
animal impulse to “own” the woman we
love. “Oh! Stephen dear,” the wonderful
Mary cries, “can’t there be love —love with-
out this clutching, this gripping, this carry-
ing off?” And the man is equally to blame.
Far more than Mary I was accepting
the conventions of our time. It seemed to
me not merely reasonable but necessary that
because she loved me she should place her
life in my youthful and inexpert keeping,
share my struggles and the real hardships
they would have meant for her, devote her-
self to my happiness, bear me children, be
my inspiration in imaginative moments, my
squaw, helper and possession through the
whole 24 hours of every day, and incidentally
somehow rear whatever family we hap-
pened to produce, and I was still amazed
in the depths of my being that she did not
reciprocate this simple and comprehensive
intention. I was ready enough, I thought,
for equivalent sacrifices. I was prepared to
give my whole life, subordinate all my am-
bitions, to the effort to maintain our home.
But Mary did not want him to relinquish
his ambitions just “to become a horrible
little specialist in feeding and keeping” her.
She wanted “herself.” And Stratton wanted
her)
I wanted her as barbarians want a hunted
enemy, alive or dead. It was a flaming
jealousy to have her mine. That granted,
then I was prepared for all devotions. This
is how men love women. Almost as exclu-
sively and fiercely I think women love men.
And the deepest question before humanity is
just how far this jealous greed may be
subdued to a more generous passion.
So Mary, who was rather a minx, but an
altogether charming minx, married her mil-
lionaire, and Stratton became a man in
South Africa. When her husband came to
know, happened the inevitable triangular
scene of husband, lover, wife. And the
inevitable conundrum: “You must choose
between us. Lover or husband?” But
Mary has quite other ideas.
“Why shouldn’t I stay here? Why must
I choose between two men? I want neither
of you. I want myself. I’m not a thing.
I’m a human being. I’m not your thing,
Justin —nor yours, Stephen. Yet you want
to quarrel over me—like two dogs over a
bone. I am going to stay here —in my
house!”
We had become actors in that new human
comedy that is just beginning in the world,
that comedy in which men still dispute the
possession and the manner of the possession
of women according to the ancient rules,
while they on their side are determining
ever more definitely that they will not be
possessed.
So Stratton makes an undignmeit exit,
and goes into .exile. He revises his per-
spectives. At first he saw the world as “a
vast if as yet a quite inconclusive drama
between employer and employed.” He saw
the history of mankind as a history of labor,
as a history of the perpetual attempts of an
intelligent minority to get things done by
other people. But his final conclusion is
that labor problems are problems merely by
the way.
They have played their part in a greater
scheme. This phase of expropriation and
enslavement, this half designed and half un-
conscious driving of the didler by the clever,
of the pacific by the bolder, of those with
weak appetites and imaginations by those
with stronger appetites and imaginations,
has been a necessary phase in human devel-
opment. But....it is necessary no longer.
Strangest of saviors, there rises over the
conflicts of mankind the glittering angular
promise of the machine. There is no longer
any need for slavery, open or disguised. We
do not need slaves nor toilers nor mere lab-
orers any more ; they are no longer essential
to a civilisation. Man has ridden on his
brother man out of the need of servitude.
He struggles through to a new phase, a
phase of release, a phase when leisure and
an unexampled freedom are possible to
every human being. Are possible.
For Civilisation has never yet existed ; it
has only continually and obstinately at-
tempted to be. Innumerable experiments
have been made from the beginning of his-
tory to evolve a civilisation; and each in
turn has fallen bsck into barbarism. But
this time the attempt seems likely to evolve
into something permanently achieved and
stable. “Mankind may be now in the dawn
of a fresh phase of living altogether.” The
effort now is less concentrated, less dramatic.
There is no one vital centre which could be
destroyed and bring with it the fall of civili-
sation. And it is now not one person or
dynasty or religion or race which carries
our destiny. The world-soul is gradually
evolving: the collective mind will carry on
the experiment without much danger of a
smash, though doubtless minor accidents will
occur on the railway line.
But, as always in modern novels, it is not
the question of humanity that interests the
author, but the question of half of humanity
—that half that wipes the dust off its high-
heeled shoes on to its stockings, preferring
dirty legs to dirty shoes. And here Mary,
the exquisite Mary of the earlier scenes —
first cousin to “Diana of the Crossways”—
becomes merely Wells’ mouthpiece. Hear
that half of the sex suddenly become mas-
culinely articulate: —
Man is the most sexual of all the beasts.
Half of him, womankind, rather more than
half, isn’t simply human at all, it’s special-
ised, specialised for the young, not merely
naturally and physically as animals are,
but mentally and artificially. Womankind
isn’t human, it’s reduced human. It’s “the
Sex,” as the Victorians used to say.... The
future of the sex is the centre of the whole
problem of the human future.
And to Stratton, building up his vast,
clean, commonsense, ideal structure of a
civilisation of brains, Mary writes shatter-
ing his dreams; for this intellectually con-
ceived civilisation hasn’t included Woman
and her ways. Especially her ways.
All this great world-state of your man’s
imagination is going to be wrecked by us
if you ignore us, we women are going to be
the Goths and Huns of another Decline and
Fall. We are going to sit in the conspicu-
ous places of the world and loot all your
patient accumulations. We are going t 0...
turn the princes among you into undignified
slaves. Because, you see, specialised as we
are, we are not quite specialised. We are
specialised under duress, and at the first
glimpse of a chance we abandon our cradles
and drop our pots and pans and go for the
vast and elegant side possibilities—of our
specialisation. Out we come, looking for the
fun the men are having. Dress us, feed us,
play with us ! We’ll pay you in excitement —
tremendous excitement. The State indeed !
All your little triumphs or science and
economy, all your little accumulations of
wealth that you think will presently make
the struggle for life an old story and the
millennium possible—tee spend. And all
yoqr dreams of brotherhood! —we will set
you* by the ears.
It is the passionate side of all humans,
male and female, that is going to upset
Wells’ beautifully constructed apple-cart.
Well, what are we going to do with these
delightful and adorable rebels, these—in
Wells’ fine phrases—these “pretty silken
furry feathery jewelled silences ,” these
“soft and scented hawks”?
We’re all to pieces (says Mary). That’s
what brought down Rome. The women
went to pieces then, and the women are going
to pieces to-day The wives are talking
treason in your houses. It’s no good telling
us to go back to the Ancient Virtues. The
Ancient Virtues haven’t kept. The Ancient
Virtues in an advanced state of decay is
what was the matter with Rome and what
is the matter with us We’ve overflowed.
We’ve got to go on to a lot of new virtues
Everywhere is this prison of sex. Have
you ever thought just all that it means
when every woman in the world goes dressed
in a costume to indicate her sex, her car-
dinal fact, she has her hair grown to
its longest because yours is short, and every-
thing conceivable is done to remind us (and
you) of the fundamental trouble between
us? As if there was need of reminding?
Of course, the problem is chiefly one of
the senseless rich. As Mary remarks: —
Each of us has had her little fling at
maternity—about as much as a washer-
woman does in her odd time every two or
three years—and that is our uttermost real-
ity. All the rest, —trimmings !... .Men in-
vent, create, do miracles with the world, and
we translate it all into shopping, into a
glitter of households, into an immense
parade of pride and excitement. We excite
men, we stir them to get us and keep us.
Men turn from their ideas of brotherhood to
elaborate our separate cages.
Perhaps, Mary delightfully admits, you
can’t have two sexes loose together. You
must shuf one up. But, all the same, woman
is on strike. The workers’ hopes are nothing
to women’s. Already in London women are
taking to sabotage.
Your old social machine is working with-
out us apd in spite of us ; it carries us along
with it, and we are sand in the bearings.
I am not a wheel, I’m grit.
Well, there it is: an arraignment of jeal-
ousy, a plea for the “sister-lover who must
replace the seductive and abject womanhood,
owned, mastered and deceiving, who waste
the world to-day” ; a provocative book, hint-
ing at tremendous possibilities. . . .It is every
year growing more evident that Wells is
almost a millennium in advance of his world.

The competition arranged by the N.S.W. Musical
Association for a prize of £100, presented by Farmer
and Co., Sydney, for the best National Song for Aus-
tralia, resulted in the selection by the adjudicators,
Prof. M. W. MacCallum (Sydney University), Prof.
T. G. Tucker (Melb. University) and W. Arundel
Orchard (N.S.W. Musical Association), of the follow-
ing set of verses, by Arthur H. Adams: —
Vast the heritage we hold,
League on endless league unrolled,
Splashed with sun and wattle-gold,
God’s demesne, Australia!
Great our opportunity,
Greater must our courage be,
For our race we hold in fee
God’s demesne, Australia.
Sons of those who won the sea,
Of Imperial blood are we;
Ours the country of the free —
God’s demesne, Australia 1
Freedom for our onward stride!
Wide our continent, and wide
Are the faiths and hopes that guide
God’s demesne, Australia.
Though begirt with guardian seas,
Not in careless, slothful ease
Shall we shield thy liberties,
God’s demesne, Australia 1
Loyal scions of our race,
Ready chance and change to face,
We shall die, but ne’er disgrace
God’s demesne, Australia.
Under pen-names 722 sets of verses were submitted
from all parts of the Commonwealth. The adjudica-
tors state that they had regard not only for the
literary merit, but for considerations such as these:
The words must be suitable for the music of a song
“of somewhat marked melody.” It must be quite
simple, without any subtlety in diction, metre or
allusion ; it must be social rather than individual in
character ; being for popular use, it must neither be
too subjective nor refer to too special a situation; it
should not be ephemeral, sectional or undignified.
“The youth of the country is passing, its exemp-
tion from war may not last, its recent arrangements
for self-defence will soon be old, and such matters
should not be insisted upon.” The references should
not be exclusively furnished from one State, the
coloring should not be exclusively urban or rural, the
sentiments should not be distinctive of one class or
party. Boastfulness, etc., should be avoided. Only
when these considerations had been fulfilled had the
literary qualities been considered. A further prize
of £100 is now offered by Farmer and Co., for the
best musical setting of these verses. Settings must
be original, and not previously published with other
words; they may be arranged for solo voice or chorus
(of not more than four parts), or solo and chorus
combined, and in either case a piano accompani-
ment may be added. But the right is reserved to
award the prize for the melody alone. All MSS.
must be written in ink, on one side of the paper only,
under a pen-name, with no mark to indicate the
identity of the competitor, a sealed letter must
accompany the music, containing the name of the
composer and marked outside merely with the pen-
name ; and an entrance fee of 5s. must also be for-
warded. The package must be registered, and posted to
the Hon. Sec., the Musical Association of N.S.W., 16
Paling’s Buildings, Ash-street, Sydney. The adjudi-
cators consist of one leading musician from each
State. The entries must reach the above address by
February 20, 1914.
•
Sonneteers are notified that entries for
the sonnet on our November must reach this
page by December (i. Also, the usual half-
guinea will be offered for a sonnet on
December, to reach us by January 3, 1914.
So far there has been a slight slump in
November sonnets.
The most characteristic Christmas book
to send abroad is A. E. Sulman’s Some
Familiar WilS Flowers (Angus and Robert-
son, Sydney)—a series of artistically ar-
ranged photographic reproductions of our
wealth of unique wild flowers. Its local
sale, sure to be great, will stimulate that
love of our own land which still paradoxi-
cally needs stimulation.
The Australian dramatist is advised that
a 2s. edition of William Archer’s Play-
Malcing, a Manual of Craftsmanship, will
shortly be available (Chapman and Hall).
Gwen, a romance of Australian station
life, by Leslie Alfred Redgrave (S. D. Smith,
Sydney J, is quite innocuous. It is true
that, as the author asserts in his foreword,
he has “averted” the “seemingly general pit-
fall of Australian writers,” the pitfall being
“their tendency to fall into the portrayal
of the pitiful plights of the pioneer, the sor-
rowful story of an ill-starred swagsman, and
the dread of the direful drought.” But his
romance is written in stilted phraseology,
and is practically devoid of fiction-interest,
and his sentiment is girly-girly. The Aus-
tralian background is, however, conscienti-
ously delineated. But the story, despite the
fact that each page is decorated with a gum
tree, is quite uncharacteristic of Australia.
Somehow we prefer a Sorrowful Story of an
Ill-Starred Swagsman, or even the Dread of
the Direful Drought.
Novelists Australiennes
Here are two more Australian girls bm
into fiction. Mabel Sprent, the author J
Loves Apprenticeship (Methuen) writes ih
conventional novel fairly well. H er
begins dully in dull England, quickens its
heart-beats in Berlin, raises sudden hones ~?
adventure in Africa, hurries back to An
tralia, where we meet a Prime Minister wh
never was, and ends incontinently and incml-
lbly in Africa. Her heroine’s reckless Aim
tralian temperament is set against a drat
background of provincial English feminity
too vaguely characterised; the hero i s a
Hitchens character, a grim, gaunt man of the
desert; but “Polly had a cat-like weakness for
being caressed by superb beings to whom she
attached herself,” and when the bronzed hero
disappears over the edge of Africa, Polly fi n <j s
in Australia another superb being to caress
her. This is the romantic Premier who
exists only in feminine fiction. But whv
Polly deserts him for her African old man of
the desert is not clearly enough indicated A
just readable novel from a facile pen. Boom
for one picture of Melbourne re-visited
“Polly had seen the town for the first and
only other time when she had come there on
her way to England six years ago. On that
occasion she had been extraordinarily i m „
pressed with the size and grandeur of this
the only city she had ever seen. She remem-
bered that she had been painfully confused
by the sounds of traffic, the number of streets
and all by the incredible numbers of
people. Now she was somewhat nonplussed
to find a big, dusty, straggling village, with
wide, empty streets and irregular houses
which, from the opposite pavement, looked
absurdly small and noticeably shoddy. The
absence of all city noises, and the consequent
audibleness of the people’s voices, was the
next thing that struck her. The voices, too
were nasal and metallic, and affected her
unpleasantly.”
D. Egerton Jones, author of Peter Piper
(Cassell, per Dymock’s Library), has more
pith in her. The heroine tells her story to
her diary, which she personifies as a femi-
nine “Di,” —but Di is more long-suffering
than the average reader. The convention is
out-moded, and it tempts the writer to dis-
cursiveness. But Peter has a story to tell.
Brought up in the back-blocks as a boy by
a soured and drunken father, she in her lone-
liness and ignorance of life gives herself to
the first man who enters her Eden as a
lover. He rides away; but he rides away
cursing himself. Then follows the astound-
ing transformation of Peter. She comes to
Adelaide, puts on corsets, and develops into
a beauty with a perfect complexion! In
Adelaide the only thing that seems to
happen—and it happens all the time
* —is love-making. We learn from “Di”
of a succession of love-affairs among
her friends, and several with Peter.
Of course, the seducer turns up again,
and gets the glassy stare of contempt
from the new Peter. But, obvious to every
hardened novel-reader, there is always the
old way out to the happy ending. She
confesses her lapse to her fiancd, and is turned
down. Thus the way is open for her seducer
again to win her love.
The plot is chiefly picnics, platonics and
passion; but the writing is better than the
plot. Like other Australian girls who ven-
ture into fiction, D. Egerton Jones can write
with that touch of audacity and that bizarre
humor that makes even a diary worth read-
ing. She sees the sun go down, “like a lump
of liver, red and nasty, dripping on to the
horizon.” And when she sees The Man
again: “I felt so funny, just as if a sausage
machine was where my stomach ought to be.
Have you ever felt as if you ended at the
waist ? I am certain if I had tried to stand
on my legs I could no more have managed
them than Dolly’s.” She loves dancing, “the
swish of the frocks, and the nice, sniffy whiff
of the powder on the girls’ shoulders; and to
watch them look sideways with their eyes,
and the men bending right up close.” Also,
“Women are comic things, but they can’t
bluff each other.”
Too long, of course, but full of fun and
intimate feminine touches. D. Egerton Jones
will learn to do better.

AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
Why The Halo Of Quality Surrounds
’WINCHESTER
Rifle and Pistol Cartridges
Except the powder, everything that goes into Winches-
ter Cartridges is made in the Winchester plant. The
metal for the shells is kept exactly right by chemical
analysis and physical tests. The powder used must
show stability and proper pressure and velocity. The
primers must be sure fire, and each lot of finished cart-
ridges must pass a shooting test for accuracy. This
system of manufacture, coupled with the most complete
facilities and years of experience, has made Winchester
Cartridges unequalled for quality and in popularity.
The W brand cost only a few cents more a box than in-
ferior cartridges while they are dollars better. They are

Miss A. M. Cardwell
one of the most brilliant
teachers of the N. S. Wales
Educational Service for over
30 years—who has now re-
tired—and who has filled
some of the highest posi-
tions in the Public School
Service, writes her emphatic
opinion of
CLEMENTS
- - TONIC - ■
Miss Cardwell writes from her 'private residence, “Coreeßooth Street,
Annandalc, Sj/dney: —
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.,
“I have very great pleasure in testifying to Clements Tonic as a
builder-up when in a run-down condition.
“When teaching in the State schools of New South Wales* I many
times resorted to its use, taking one to three bottles in course.
“The ever constant strain on the nerves of a Public School teacher
soon brings on a low state of the whole system. In my case it was over-
strain in teaching and mental worry through family bereavements. See-
ing Clements Tonic advertised, I tried one small bottle, and feeling much
benefit got the larger size. It was such a restorative that whenever I felt
the least run-down, it never failed me. No household should be without
it, or fail to use it in any case of over-strain, for I feel sure it will have
the desired effect. You may publish this letter.
“Gratefully yours, A. M. CARDWELL.”

gestion, Sick Headache, Constipation or Anaemia. All chemists and stores

This Book Tells How You Can
Get Rid of Your Varicose Veins.
If you suffer from Varicose Veins or Ulcers, or both,
I believe that. I can completely cure you. I have treated
hundreds of terrible cases with the utmost success, and I
know that but very few cases are really incurable.
Very few doctors tell you they can cure this trouble.
They prefer to ignore it. Doctors could not cure me, 1 cured
myself. I then cured my friends, and then made hundreds
of new friends by curing people who had suffered in some
cases for a. quarter of a century. Hence I believe I can
cure you.
It will pay you well to fully investigate my method. My
, treatment is applied at your own home, and does not require
you to lay up, and is painless and harmless., The worst cases
usually respond inside the first few weeks, and old, stubborn
cases are perfectly cured under a suitable course of treatment.
GUARANTEE GIVEN IN EVERY CASE ACCEPTED BY US
AS CURABLE.
Give me full details of your case. If I can cure you I
will say so, and send you a guarantee. You run no risk.
You can lose nothing if I should fail; but I have built up a
large business —-not on failures, but on successes in eases formerly given up as hopeless. Let
me send you hundreds of grateful testimonials.
WE WILL SEND YOU SCORES OF LETTERS LIKE THE FOLLOWING:—
Manager Vecsey Varix-arium, Rath scar, Vic., June 9, 1913.
Dear Sir, —After twenty-four years’ suffering from had varicose veins,
your treatment has given me back the use of my legs, comfortable and free
from pain, and my gratitude can he better imagined than described. Since
beginning the treatment, and ever since I completed it, 1 have noticed a vast
difference in my heart action; my circulation is greatly improved, and I feel
better in every respect. Prior to the treatment, my heart was very bad. There
is no doubt that the treatment is not only harmless, but it is wonderful as
well.—Yours gratefully, V. J. JARDINE.

P NTERPRISING PRESERVE CANNERS in every part of the world
‘—have come to realise that the old, slow, unsanitary method of
manufacturing and sealing cans by hand with poisonous solders is ob-
solete.
That is why the MAX AMS SANITARY CANNING MACHINERY
is being used by the world’s leading canners. If you are using cans
ior packing preserves, fruits, vegetables, or in fact any food product, the
SANITARY, SOLDERLESS, HERMETICALLY SEALED CANS
made by these machines will save you time, money and labor.
No. 58 and No. 68 Automatic Double Seamers will seal can tops on
bodies ljin. high and 2in. in diameter up to 1 gallon and over. The
scope in the range of possible changes is instantly appreciated.
No adjusting or fussing, or mechanical skill required. Can be run
by boy or girl.
These machines are BY NO MEANS confined to any PARTICULAR
CLASS of cans. The operation of these Seamers is SIMPLE. The
cans are automatically conveyed to the baseplate with the cover, and
INSTANTLY the CAN engages the rollers, making a CLEAN and tight
DOUBLE SEAM.
We Furnish Complete Outfit for Making These Cans.

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.-
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Jester.
This ant-heap men have called the Earth
I hold since callow youth
A merry jest, a mighty jest,
A pleasant jest, in truth.
For young and old, and rich and poor,
They live and love their while;
By Comus, sir, it is a sight
To make a dead man smile.
’Tis droll to see them delve and draw,
And grasp, and clasp, and clutch ;
Full seriously their gains are hugged,
As though life mattered much.
And some grow rich by honest means,
And some by fraud and stealth;
’Tis folly—folly’s self, for sure —
This heaping up of wealth ;
For, mark you, body-spent and old,
And lame of hands and feet,
When Time cries, “Halt, the feast is set!”
What teeth are left to eat?
The red, roast meats, the ruddy loves,
They set their hearts to win.
Reproach them—toothless, tasteless, worn,
Too old to even sin.
The trickster Time, with art and guile
Befools their fond desires;
No embers under-sleep the ash,
All dead their covered fires.
’Tis Laughter’s rich, appropriate food,
’Tis Humor’s life and breath —
To watch the antics and the games
Of sly old master Death.
For hither, thither, now, anon,
His stealthy footsteps stray—
A squeeze.. ..a gasp, and flesh, Warm flesh
Is turned to pallid clay.
O sir, these things I hold in age,
As once I held in youth—•
A merry jest, a mighty jest,
A pleasant jest, in truth.

Melbourne.
Sydney, Sydney city,
You are more than fair,
With the sunset opals
Braided in your hair;
Like a witch of olden
’Neath your lifted wand,
Lo ! they dream, forgetful,
In a lotus land,
While in dim procession
Laughter-drunken, gay,
All the hours go drifting
Like a dream away !
Sydney, Sydney city,
From your lighted quays
Ferry fleets of Fancy
Ruffle magian seas.
So, with bright wakes chasing
Dragon-flies of gold,
On her lighted waters
Venice dreamed of old ;
Soft as hers thy song is,
Chant and madrigal;
’Tis a younger Venice
Keeping carnival!
Sydney, Sydney city,
Vain your myriad charms,
Vain the soft appeal is
Of your jewelled arms;
There’s a stern grey lady
Holds my heart in fee;
Who has felt her presence
Has no vows for thee ;
On his lips her name is,
In his heart a drouth
For the Grand Grey Lady,
The lady of the South!
VICTORIA.
MARIE E. J. PITT.
Spring Song.
Life would be great, it seems to me,
If one could draw Illusion’s sting
So absolutely as to be
An Atheist in ev’rything.
Take the imposture known as Love,
And estimate the dreadful price
It asks of him who grasps the glove
Which veils its hand of fire and ice.
The wretched nights ; the tortured heart;
The panic stabs of jealous fear;
The gloom when she was far apart;
The greater gloom when she was near.
How good if, when this curse came in,
One could but gaily realise
That nought in all this world of sin
So swiftly and completely dies.
So might one treat Love like a drink —
The sort that’s swallowed by the score—
And, having quaffed it, never think
Of worrying about it more.
Friendships are pleasing, while they last;
The trouble is their chronic way
Of fleeing, civilly but fast,
Just when they’re wanted most to stay.
Wild and incredulous despair
And grief and anger, burning hot
(All things most difficult to bear),
Are then the wretched victim’s lot.
These miseries would not arrive
If one could turn a cynic face
On friendship’s vows, and so contrive
To keep it in its proper place.
My boyhood’s days were rendered black
By marrow-freezing thoughts of Hell:
I saw myself upon the rack,
And most of those I loved as well.
And even now, when I am ill,
The ghastly old-lime fears return
Of deathless worms which eat their fill,
And fires which never cease to burn.
Grant me, O Lord, that priceless shield,
The spurning of such lies as these;
Life may he dull, hut it will yield
At least the recompense of ease.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “ The Editor, Tiie Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE ELECTION IN N. S. WALES.
On Saturday the people of N. S. Wales will
bi given the opportunity to arise in their
majesty and speak—more or less. It will be
what the papers are in the habit of terming,
with tine, sonorous inaccuracy, the electors’
Day of Power. Between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m.,
or thereabouts, the citizens will —strictly in
theory—be the arbiters of their political des-
tinies, so far as the coming three years are
concerned. As a matter of fact, the people
will not attempt to arise and speak to any
great extent. It will be surprising if as
many as six out of 10 of them trouble to
do it. For one thing the more intelligent
students of affairs are tired of straining
their vocal chords to no purpose. The resi-
dents of Sydney’s North Shore have been
clamoring for a Harbor bridge for decades.
The producers of the Southern Tableland
and of the country behind Port Stephens
have been speaking regularly, every three
years, and intermittently at by-elections,
in favor of the opening up of fresh ports.
And the majestic voice of the person in the
street has been heard everywhere, on such
subjects as the advisability of abolishing the
Legislative Council and ceasing to import
Governors. The embittered conclusion which
many of them have formed is that, under
the existing system of government, it is
hardly worth while troubling to speak on
the alleged Day of Power since one Admin-
istration neglects its instructions in much the
same cynical fashion as another; the
object that is common to all being to accom-
plish as little as possible in the way
of drastic change, so that the fears of the
enemy may be soothed, and the way paved
for a further term of office and affluence.
That is one of the reasons why the wail
about “apathy” is raised, and with a good
deal of justification, after each election. It
is against nature to expect anything ap-
proaching widespread enthusiasm for
parties which have proved themselves at
different times to be liars and betrayers of
the trust reposed in them.
The question presents itself: Which of
the two big organisations that are now
battling for those votes which mean a steady
and lucrative job, is the more untrustworthy
and generally hopeless? The Bulletin is
obliged regretfully to hand the prize-money
to the Holman party. That party reflects
the shifty personality of its leader —just
as the Wade party reflects, though in a
lesser degree, the characteristics of its dull
chief. Holman has great ability of a sort.
Also he has magnetism, and charm, and the
light touch, and a talent for controversy,
and the gift of spell-binding the crowd. But
his democracy belongs to a bygone period.
New ideas barely touch him. He is blind
and deaf to the National movement of the
past decade. These things explain in part
his deplorable attitude towards Defence and
the Referenda questions. Quarter of a cen-
tury ago no rising young Radical that was
worth a place in the local debating society
team dreamed of having any truck with
“militarism” ; and when Holman was a lad
the States’ Rights creed was feckoned good
democracy in N. S. Wales. So to-day
Holman belongs to a Peace Society, though
every local worker has a big stake in Aus-
tralia, and every democrat should be pre-
pared, at any sacrifice, to hold the country
for the white races ; and he is hostile to anv
change in the Federal Constitution that wiil
rob the States of their “powers,” though
he should well know that in no other
way can the industrial reforms to which his
party is committed be achieved. Tory
sentiments, _ such as these, are to be
looked for in a Liberal leader, and they are
proportionately harmless. In one who pos-
tures as an advanced democrat, and who
by virtue of his cleverness is able to do it
convincingly, they amount to a menace and
a curse.
* * * *
But Holman and the party which he
leads, have more than these offences to
answer for. The party gained office, to a
great extent, on the sane and honest finance
cry. They were to cease borrowing, except
for the financing of such public works as
would pay interest and provide a contribu-
tion to a sinking fund. Also, they were to
arrange to gradually repay the State’s mon-
strous public debt, and in other respects pro-
vide a good financial example for their
spendthrift predecessors. According to the
Government Statist of N. S. Wales, who
makes every allowance he can for the Min-
istry, this is how they have observed their
pledges in the matter of loan expenditure:—
mi £3,921,758
1912 5,491,103
1913 . . . . . . 7,703,594
And if Labor is returned to power it intends,
on the word of its own leaders, to hit things
up even more vigorously in the borrow-and-
boom line. The first plank of the State
Labor platform demands the abolition of the
office of State Governor, and the wiping-out
of the Legislative Council. The Holman
Government lived up to this part of its
creed by strengthening the Council with a
batch of new members who were not pledged
to vote the Council out of existence, and by
acquiescing unprotestingly in the appoint-
ment of a successor to Lord Chelmsfokd.
On the other hand, it went out of its way to
oust the Governor-General of tie Common-
wealth from Macquarie-street, not, it is sus-
pected, on any point of principle whatever,
but in a futile effort to wring a species of
political blackmail from the Australian Gov-
ernment. Before its advent to power State
Labor postured as the back-blocker’s friend —
the party which was to save him from the
inequitable selfishness of the vested interest-
holders of Sydney. Hope springs eternal
even in the breasts of back-blockers. Act-
ing on the general theory that no Liberal
Government had ever risked offending Syd-
ney by so much as talking of opening up
the rival ports along the coast, and that
Labor had been commonly suspected,
hitherto, of honesty, if of no other virtues,
the producing class put its trust in the de-
centralisation promises of the present N. S.
Wales Ministry. The latter has had three
years wherein to fulfil those promises. The
nett result is that Port Stephens and Jervis
Bay are still, to all intents and purposes, the
isolated waters they were when the aborig-
inal savage roamed their shores; that many
thousands of pounds sterling have been
lost to the farming classes in produce and
stock ruined by needlessly long haulage on
the way to market; that those country dis-
tricts which have been hit in this fashion
are steadily losing in the matter of popula-
tion ; and that Sydney is becoming, propor-
tionately, more and more congested. Inci-
dentally, the N. S. Wales Labor Government
introduced an Income Tax Bill which was a
disgrace to any allegedly democratic party,
and a Fair Rents Bill which was an ab-
surdity. It got the awkward Nielsen out
of the way by a generous sacrifice of the
public’s money. And it has done other
things that no one who listened to its
righteous talk, in the days when it sat in
chronic opposition, would have dreamed of
crediting it with.
* *
On the other side is the Wade party. It
is not the sort of party to rob the widow
and orphan and blew £lOOO of borrowed
money in reckless celebration of the event.
There is nothing heroic about its election-
eering lies. It has none of the cynical dis-
honesty of the care-free political pirate—the
sort of expansive buccaneer who, having
boarded the ship of State on the non-borrow-
ing plank, has the steely nerve to straight-
way inform the crew that they shall see,
presently, such an orgy of borrowing as they
had not conceived of. The main trouble with
N. S. Wales Liberalism is a mud-brown lack
of imagination, and a bias towards a form
of futile larrikinism which is its substitute
for Parliamentary criticism. It suffers,
furthermore, from the disability of having
nothing that can by any stretch of the imag-
ination be called a constructive policy. It
is strong on the wrongs of little Alice
Wilkins. And it has developed a useful
knack of working itself into a frenzy regard-
ing the amount expended by the enemy in the
destruction of some fig-tree or other. But it
has studiously refrained from committing
itself to anything of a definite nature. For
example, it is understood to promise
economy. But it refrains warily from say-
ing there shall be no more visits to the for-
eign pawnshop, and a generous sinking-fund
shall be established for the reduction of the
State debt. It deplores the casualness of the
Holman party on the decentralisation issue.
But wild lions cannot drag from it an under-
taking to throw open and develop even one
of the starved ports of the State. Wade says
that the “Governor-General shall be invited
back,” but he doesn’t commit himself to the
pla ; 1 statement that the Macquarie-street
edifice shall be handed to the Australian Gov-
ernment, on the old terms, the moment he
is returned to power. Y'et there are points
of merit about the very reticences of Wade-
ism. They indicate a glimmering of political
honesty that has long been absent from the
public life of N. S. Wales.
There is also an Independent party in the
field, as well as a Farmers and Settlers’
party; but many of the Independent
party’s members (their leader, Beeby,
for one) are virulent anti-Australians
of the fanatical State-Rights breed,
and several of them (Beeby affords
another case in point) have been as-
sociated with some of the most discredit-
able acts of the McGowen-Holman regime.
In any case an Independent rarely stays
independent, under the party system, for a
minute after his recalcitrancy has been salved
with an offer of office or its financial equiva-
lent —a characteristic which renders him an
unreliable reed to lean on. Taking the situa-
tion by and large, it seems to The Bulletin
that the only struggle worth taking cogniz-
ance of is that which is raging _ between
Labor and Liberalism. And if Liberalism
has no outstanding merit, yet it is at least
free from the demerit of financial insanity
which characterises its opponents. It is
definitely committed to a policy of economy
—for what the assurance is worth. Labor,
on the other hand, has not only declined to
pledge itself to go slow with the expenditure
in future, if it is returned to power, but it
has gone further and exuberantly announced
its intention of being a wilder borrower and
a more frantic spender than ever. It means
to have an uproarious time to-day, even if
it has to file its schedule to-morrow.
Rational people cannot support such a party.
The choice being between two calamities,
there can be no doubt that the lesser of them
is C. G. Wade.
THE STATE WITH ONE HARBOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Morning at sea. A cold and distant shaft
of thin sunlight throws a patch of the
solemn coastal range into relief. Elsewhere
the misty rain-clouds, drifting shorewards,
obscure the lonely, tree-clad peaks and
slopes. The waves leap whitely at the
carven cliffs, and a tall, toy lighthouse, its
night’s work ended, stands at attention be-
side the splendid, deserted harbor our steamer
is contemptuously passing. (“Only eighty-
seven miles more to Sydney !” says someone
reverently.) The decks are slowly drying in
the sun. A few seasick women, well swathed
in rugs, are strewn round in deck chairs.
Other passengers are solemnly watching the
coastline, or looking on at tremendously
solemn sea games. Eight exceedingly grave
albatrosses are following the leisurely ship
with a kingly minimum of exertion that is
fascinating to watch. They do not keep
their beaks to the undulating wake, but
swoop continuously from side to side, mak-
ing splendid, but apparently aimless, excur-
sions far afield over the moving waste of
watery hills and valleys. Far out to sea
giant waves amuse themselves by imitating
a distant coastal range. You see through
the cruel trick only by watching steadily
till the distant mountain foolishly subsides
like a pantomime horse, and the blanc-mange
hill rises where you had imagined a valley.
The seasick passengers keep their eyes shut
tight so that they may not see these infernal
things over the white rail that rules off
alternately on sea and sky the exact extent
of the ship’s roll.
In the smoking-room aft, two elderly men
are gravely performing the solemn rite known
as chess. The board has little round holes
in the centre of each square, and the pieces
have little round legs which hold them in
position while the ship rolls and the players
think in three volumes. A number of silent
and unemployed male passengers are clus-
tered round. They would not be there if
there was anything else to do ; but there is
nothing else to do. They have hung over
the rail and watched the coastline till the
pressure made their chests ache. They have
walked up and down on the port side, where
it is cold and windy, and they have walked
up and down on the starboard side, where it
is windy and hot. They have, searched the
sea for smoke or sails, inspected the log on
the stern rail, shioked on the hatch, argued
about the probable time of arrival, had drinks
at the curious little cramped bar, and told
one another about the two girls who were
up on the boat deck too late on the previous
evening. They have also played all avail-
able deck games. They have hung over the
stern, where the propeller shakes and
grumbles and makes a ragged white scar
on the sea. The attraction there, of course,
is the select flight of tireless sea birds that
follow, apparently just for the sake of fol-
lowing, the lonely, smoking thing with a defi-
nite object in view. Hunger is no( the lure,
for they only interrupt their monotonous
pursuit to pick up an occasional choice scrap
from the wave-tops and hollows. One at
least of the human owls aboard has a dim
idea that these marine birds are oppressed
by the unbearable loneliness of the sea.
There is a slight stir and rattle in the
smoking-room. One of the chess players has
taken his courage in both hands and has
moved one of his pieces. The other, a
knobby, black-bearded man, stares disconso-
late v over Ins steel spectacle-rims and \ rva
lately lingers a pawn. The mover a

travellers. In return for this slight enter
tainment, he leans on the counter 0 f hi'

he has never seen boat drill since* he has been
in the ship, and that the lifeboats would
probably leak like baskets if they were n!t
into the water. Once in a long while thev
practise “boat stations,” and the busy cam
tain strolls round and asks various inconmp
tents what they are supposed to do in the
event of an accident. They tell him in the
barking speech that is supposed to indicate
the man of action, and he moves on apnar
ently satisfied. Nothing is actually done- it
is just question and answer—question and
answer. Presently the grotesque entertain-
ment ends with a note from the bos’n’s
whistle. The lifeboats continue to bake on
the chocks and collect soot from the funnel
while the glib theorists scuffle back to their
potato-peeling jobs, and dishing-up jobs, and
the various jobs of throwing things over-
board. Something is always being thrown
overboard —generally it is cinders, or potato
peelings, or stale bread.
BANG ! BANG ! Somebody is firing some-
thing over the stern rail. Half the ship’s
company hurry along and find it is the tall,
drinky commercial traveller. He has a
rusty revolver with which he is making
efforts to kill one or several of the kingly-
albatrosses that swoop to and fro and go
skating down the wind on one wing-tip.
BANG! The splendid target drifts scorn-
fully past, quite uninjured. CLICK! The
rotten revolver has missed fire! CLICK!
While he is squinting at his murdering im-
plement, the first officer steps up and tells
him it is against the regulations. There is
no more murder attempted, and the alba-
trosses follow on undisturbed. Not that they
minded the firing.
“What about a drink?” asks one of the
inseparable voyagers, suddenly tired of
watching the spinning-wheel of the log and
the long line trailing sinuously behind over
the swells. The other voyager gravely con-
curs, and the drink is performed with great
solemnity while the ship rolls.
On the way back to the sunny side of the
deck, they look in at the smoking-room win-
dow. The two chess-players are still bowed
over the board. The man on the settee is
still heavily asleep. He looks as if he were
doing the trip under chloroform.
The voice of the albatross-shooter is heard
bar-bragging: “I bet you a tenner I can
jump ! Hold on ! I bet you a tenner
I !” A chorus of derisive laughter
drowns the rest of his speech. The albatross-
shooter is plainly the sort of man who can’t
keep still. He couldn’t sit in a deck chair
for hours on end and let things flow past his
eyes. As he tramps along the deck, hatless
and boisterously shouting encouragement to
his dull but faithful band of followers, the
irregular line of rugged meditators glance at
him resentfully. There is something indecent
about his healthy restlessness. He is
presently discovered vigorously conducting a
sort of shoving tournament. One of the
inseparables sits on the hatch, and the other,
being offered a cue or pusher, silently accepts
it and becomes deeply involved in the tricky
game, which consists principally of beating
the slow roll of the ship and getting a wooden
disc to stay somewhere within a chalked
area. All the time the ship steams slowly
and deliberately towards Sydney. And there
are no intermediate cities visible from the
sea —just green cliffs and mountains.
After a long interval, during which atten-
tion has been focussed inboard on the crude
deck game, someone says, “Must be getting
close to Sydney now. Look at the smoke!”
everybody looks up and discovers steamer
smoke everywhere, and, far awa..y on the
horizon rim, the glint of topsails. After
two days’ voyaging along a lonely coastline,
the sea is populous with ships, all of them
going to or coming from the open gates of
the only recognised first-grade port of the
State. d
The game breaks up gradually. Some go
below to finish their packing and disguise
themselves heavily in correct shore clothes.
When they reappear, the steamer is on
Bondi, and the hanging cemetery on the
sloping ocean cliff is showing all its white
gravestones like so many teeth.
Two seamen come aft. and. under the eye
of an officer, start to haul in the trailing log-
line with the winged end. The officer un-
screws the patent log itself from the stern
rail and takes it away to the bridge. The
two inseparables watch him along the deck
until he-disappears up the ladder with his
prize. The dripping line is coiled and hung
un in the steamy den where the restless
steering engine sighs, and starts, ana
clatters, and the great, oily rudder. chains
work slowly to and fro. The two sailors go
forward, carefully watched by the two be-
reaved log-haunters. That part of the enter-
tainment is over.
Presently the ship is sliding steadily up
Sydney Harbor. The deck is thronged tv
people who are strangers to one another sim-
ply because they have got on their shor
clothes and their shore manners. , s,^ e

are all strangers. Tip-hungry stewards
linger like timid birds of prey and look
pathetically faithful. They bear some absurd
resemblance to the lost albatrosses. If the
commercial traveller were not so absorbed,
he might get out his rusty revolver and have
a shot at them. A nervous ferryboat moans
a warning and scuttles out of our way. A
winch wakes up witli a rattle and starts to
unwind a short towing hawser. Circular
Quay and its skeleton electric signs slide
past smokily, and the steamer sidles up to-
wards the Darling Horbor corner. Its
narrow berth is hidden in there somewhere
amongst the masts and funnels and smoke,
and it takes some fine navigation to arrive
safely. But if you allow a State to have
only one first-class harbor, you’ve got to put
up with some overcrowding.
One of the voyagers has an idea. ‘ Come
and have a last drink before the bar closes,
he says. So the voyage ends.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Old Idiocy Prevails.
Victoria had a golden opportunity last
week to rid itself of an anachronism, and an
expense and a profound absurdity. The
news was cabled from London that the
authorities had found great difficulty in get-
ting anyone to accept the job of Governor
of Victoria. The men of means and position
who were available were considered unsuit-
able, and those that the Asquith Govern-
ment considered suitable didn’t regard the
job as worthy of them. Sir John Fuller,
the last Victorian Governor, was presumably
looked upon as a worthy holder of the post,
so it appears to follow thru his successor is
inferior to Fuller. The thought is an ap-
palling one. Yet when the situation is
considered dispassionately, and without re-
gard to irrelevant yelps about “dis-
loyalty,” “traitorism to the Empire,’] etc.,
it becomes plain that there must inevit-
ably be a steady deterioriation in the calibre
of the imported State Governor. Not only
is there nothing for such an official to do,
but, what is far more serious, the utter
needlessness of him and his ornate entourage
has become apparent in the last few years
to the Australian community, and to such
Britishers as take any sort of intelligent
interest in Australian affairs. There is
nothing that discourages a man more than
the knowledge that he is valueless, and has
been discovered in the offence. Australian
State Governors at the present time divide
up naturally into two classes : the ones who
are sufficiently intelligent to know that the
services they perform aren’t nearly worth
the salary they get for them, and the ones
who are so calamitously stupid as to take
themselves and their ridiculous billets seri-
ously. To put it otherwise, the State Gover-
nor is bound to be either something of a
cynical impostor, or something of a fool.
Victoria, as aforesaid, was given a chance
last week to save itself a lot of badly-needed
money owing to a providential shortage .of
upper-middle class Britons who were willing
for a consideration to indulge .in three
years’ solemn leg-pulling. That is to say,
the Watt Government was given this most
valuable opportunity. Of course it failed
miserably to rise to the occasion, just as. a
Labor Government would have done in sim-
ilar circumstances. Hardly any reasoning
human being in Victoria wants the imported
Governor system to be persisted with, or re-
tards the arrangement as other than a sense-
less extravagance and a miserable manifes-
tation of national snobbishness. The State
Governor’s official duties, such as they are,
could be performed equally well, in his spare
time, by any Supreme Court judge ; or. for
that matter," by any Supreme Court judge s
tipstaff. There are plenty of local men
capable of attending to the social side of the
position, as has been proved repeatedly m
every State in the Commonwealth. The
reason why the Victorian Administration has
not done the right and sensible and econo-
mical thing in this respect, and why no \ ic-
torian Administration ever will so act, in all
probability, lies in the fact that Victoria., m
common with the rest of the States, enjoys
the Party system of Government. The 1 arty
system involves a frantic terror of what is
known as the Good Electioneering Cry. This
variety of cry is usually bogus, as witness
the Alice Wilkins uproar in N. S. Wales.
But that in no way detracts from its poli-
tical value. The first Victorian Government
that substitutes a home-grown Governor for
an imported one will have to face a storm
of reproach which, for one election at least,
may stampede the more idiotic among the
electors into the Opposition camp. It will
be told that it is disloyal; that it has insulted
the King, the Queen and the Loyal family
with dastardlv callousness ; that it is a pro-
Boer and an Anarchist; that its action m
hurling the King’s representative out of the
country is the beginning of the end. which
is to sav the casting off of the British tie
and the training of Australian guns on the
warships of the Mother Land. This sort of
humbug—lamentable though it is to have to
confess it —wins a good deal of temporary
support for the frauds who exploit it. And
the Watt Government knows it. So. Victoria
is to go on paying heavily for an imported
nonentity, not because the. State is even
remotelv suspected of wanting him. but be-
cause the Government doesn’t consider it
sound electioneering tactics to dispense with
him. That is the position in plain terms.
The City Which Is Clean —Officially.
The small-pox embargo was removed from
Svdnev last week, and the city was officially
declared to be “clean.” hor months the
most stringent measures have been taken to
wipe out the epidemic. Sydney was ren-
dered during that period a sort of plague-
centre. Unvaccinated Sydneyites were im-
prisoned within the confines of N.. »■ Wa es.
Hundreds of thousands of pounds steiling
were lost to the metropolis m trade-
to do the citizens justice they made the
various sacrifices that were demanded of
them by the Health experts without undue
complaint. The press gave the. authorities
loyal and useful help by discussing exhaus-
tively and clearly the characteristics and
dangers of small-pox ; by making public the
soundest measures of prevention, and 1 \
strengthening the hand of the Department
in other respects. And now Sydney is
“clean” —at any rate,, officially so. In
reality it is, like every other big Australian
city and town, filthily unclean. What wild
illogicality for the Commonwealth to make
the disturbance it has over Sydney’s small-
pox outbreak —this epidemic which killed no
one, which apparently never could have
killed anyone, and which did no lasting
damage to the constitution of a solitary
patient—while remaining inert in the pres-
ence of a disease which is endemic through-
out the length and breadth of Australia;
which is ten thousand times more loathsome
and more dreadful in its after effects than
the trifling complaint that is now appar-
ently expiring ; and which could be as easily
wiped out if some philanthropist-statesman
but arose and grappled courageously with
it! And what lack of a sense of proportion
it betrays on the part of the papers that they
should be prepared cheerfully to devote col-
umns and columns of their news space to
the admittedly good work of instructing the
citizen in the best means to dodge the pocket-
menace of small-pox, while maintaining the
same old murky silence concerning the vast
and hideously'real and ever-present curse of
syphilis. During the past couple of months
the great English dailies and reviews, in-
spired by the proceedings of the last Medical
Congress in London, have begun to break
through the smug conspiracy of silence that
has strangled the discussion of syphilis since
the close of the eighteenth century or earlier
—a period when so little was known of the
disease as to make outspokenness of little
public value. The Times and Daily Mail
have been handling this problem quite
frankly, as it should be handled; and the
current English Review has an article on
the same question that it would pay the
Commonwealth or any local State Govern-
ment to have reprinted and distributed in
pamnhlet form. For the hundredth time, or
thereabouts, The Bulletin mentions vehem-
ently that, without full and open discussion
in the press and elsewhere —discussion of
the comprehensive sort that was accorded
the recent small-pox epidemic —the public
will never be made to appreciate the horror
that they are cherishing in their midst; and
till the public —which is to say the electors
—get anxious on this score, the politicians
may be confidently relied on to do nothing
more harassing to themselves than sit down
comfortably and draw their salaries, as here-
tofore. The Daily Mail (London), in a
powerful snecial article by a doctor, printed
this the other day :
From the surgical out-patient theatre, at the far
end of the hospital, came agonising, penetrating
shrieks. On the table lay a man, strong, vigorous
and in the prime of life. His hair was damp with
the sweat of pain, beads of perspiration ran into one
another on his brow and trickled down his temples,
tears chased each other down his cheeks. As the surgeon
replaced the instrument he had been using in the
basin of disinfectant on the table at his side, the
patient groaned in agony.
“Oh ! . . . .doctor, that was awful!”
The surgeon rinsed his hands, and, leaning over
the table, asked him something in a confidential
tone.
“Nearly 25 years ago,” replied the patient between
his gasps.
The Times simultaneously gave a list of the
more horrible troubles that are the bitter
aftermath of syphilis. And in doing these
things these journals rendered the com-
munity a service indeed. Once any com-
munity gets to understand properly the
exact significance of the syphilis scourge,
there is not the slightest danger of its shrink-
ing from the most drastic action imaginable.
Australia, owing to its isolation, offers a
uniquely favorable field for an assault on
what the local papers still term shamefacedly
the Red Plague. Let the doctors be bound
by law to notify the authorities in the case
of every syphilitic patient who refuses to
submit to a period of isolation and injection
of salvarsan —a treatment which has been
proved, seemingly, to prevent further infec-
tion, even if it doesn’t infallibly cure the
sufferer. By this means alone the spread of
syphilis might be qhecked to an immense
extent. And it represents only the first
beginnings of the stark measures that might
be taken, and that it \yould be more than
worth the nation’s while to take. There
would necessarily be howls of protest when
the first of the innovations were made.
There is a section of the community which
sees impracticability, and inequity, and an
offence against morality in every fresh re-
form that is proposed. But their protests
would die, just as the protests against “con-
scription,” and early closing, and compul-
sory notification of diphtheria and typhoid
have died. And presently the world would be
offered the spectacle of a really clean nation
rubbing its eyes, metaphorically speaking,
and wondering why it was so insane as to
remain dirty during all those years.
The Naval Board Muddle.
From “The Old Soldier” :
Defence Minister Millen has already got his De-
partment seething. He lacks the tact of his prede-
cessor, who, apart from being an exceptionally good
administrator, had the sense to let the Service
panjandrums enjoy their personal jealousies without
assistance or interference from him. What appears
on the surface of the row is the alleged fact that
Captain Hughes-Onslow, the dismissed naval
organiser, objects to the financial member of the
Naval Board being also its secretary, and haying,
in that capacity, constant access to the Minister.
Onslow's version is understood to be that his recom-
mendations have been overruled by incompetent
civilians. If the latter is correct, he appears to
have good cause for annoyance. If a country goes
to the expense of importing an expert, it is as
well, at any rate for the first few months, to give him a
chance to orove his mettle. Even if he then turns
out to be useless, it is hardly wise or right to over-
ride him. The only thing to do is to sack him. As
regards Hughes-Onslow, no one has charged him
with incompetence. On the contrary. His defects,
such as they are, are purely the one finds in
almost every “strong man” —more especially if he is
a Service “strong man.” .
Millen seems to imagine that Service Boards are
usually happy families. His view would be different
had he had a little Admiralty or War Office experi-
ence, or served on the staff of a General-in-com-
mand. Acting on his mistaken assumption he did
things that must have been maddening to the
Board members. His explanation of the trouble is
best proof of the fact. He admits that “the existing
arrangement places undue power in the officer’s hands,
who, first as finance member shares in the delibera-
tions of the Board, and later on, as secretary, places
the Board’s recommendations before the Minister.”
But he goes on: “It. is only right to say, on behalf
of Mr. Manisty, the present finance member and
naval secretary, that I have never known him to
express an opinion on a Board recommendation until
I asked him to, do so, and, further, in presenting a
recommendation from which he disagreed, he invari-
ably laid before me any minutes or other documents
supporting the view from which he differed.” In
other words, Manisty has been allowed to argue out
every question in which he took an interest oyer
again before the Minister, and on oocasion get him
to override the Board’s decisions. If it does not
mean that, what does it mean? As secretary of _ the
Board it was his duty to lay the Board’s decisions
before the Minister, and he, ought not to have given
his private views even if asked. Millen ought to
have known better than to ask for them ; and that he
did not know better is pretty clear proof of his
incompetence, unless, indeed, there is an idea at
the back of the Government’s mind of wrecking the
Defence System.

Exit Fuller,
If the thinking people of Victoria needed
any further evidence against the importation
of Governors it was freely supplied by
Sir John Fuller, late of the vice-regal office.
The first duty of anyone claiming the title
of Excellency is, as Tiie Bulletin under-
stands such matters, to present an appear-
ance in public that shall always command
respect in the best Wowser sense of the
word. A Governor is not required to be the
glass of fashion and the mould of form. But
he must never provoke intelligently disre-
spectful comment. In his own way, whatever
his way may be, he should maintain his posi-
tion before the world, attaching proper social
value to it, and thus distracting attention
from the fact that a Governor, at the best,
is a mere political figurehead and a person-
age of no real interest to the million or more
who never get any sort of benefit from his
salary. Judged by this rule, Sir John
Fuller was quite notoriously wanting. He
was often farcically inefficient as a State
figurehead, and his shortcomings were gener-
ally recognised. In his tourings round the
country he advertised his unfitness to receive
the reverential adulation commonly accorded
to the occupant of his billet; and now that
he has finally quitted a position which he
did not adorn, there is not the least occasion
to pretend regret. Indeed, the fact that
official protestations of profound sorrow
have been made serves to show the hollow
hypocrisy of the whole vice-regal business.

White Slavers in Sydney?
“8.L.” writes :
The utter disappearance of Miss Mona West may
be cleared up before this letter appears. There may
be reasons why a young and beautiful girl may
choose to disappear ; but the evident police theory, and
presumably that of her people, is that she had been
seized by the agents of White Slavery. Sydney has
suddenly been filled with a flood of gossip and rumor,
difficult to trace and substantiate, but all pointing
to the belief, or the scare, that there is such a thing
as White Slavery, and that its agents are particu-
larly energetic in this city. That it was in exist-
ence a few years ago this writer has first-hand evi-
dence to prove. A certain house was let to a busi-
ness man, and the owner was somewhat surprised to
find that the tenant-had suddenly disappeared. From
the police he learnt that this man had been suspected
of decoying girls to his place, but before the law
could put hands on him he had fled.
And now stories such as the following are being
repeated, and possibly exaggerated, throughout Syd-
ney. Several of them deal with women in shops.
There is one of a stranger-woman offering a young
girl tickets for a picture show, to which she pro-
posed taking the girl. There is another of a woman
getting into conversation with a girl shopping, ad-
miring her hat, and attempting to persuade her to
accompany her to a hat-shop in Castlereagh-street,
where the stranger said she bad seen a hat that
would suit the girl infinitely better than the one
she was then wearing. It might be suggested that
this woman was merely a tout for another hat-shop,
but business enterprise hardly goes so far for so little
return. The suggestion is that the woman meant to
decoy the girl to some office in a building in that
street. There is the other story of a girl shopping
with her mother. The mother had to go to another
counter, and while the girl was waiting for her, a
stranger-woman told her that her mother had fainted,
and that she had asked for her daughter; The girl
was about to go with the woman when a friend inter-
posed, saying that she had just seen the mother, and
that she was quite well. Thereupon the woman sud-
denly left. There is the story of a girl, seen in
charge of two nurses in uniform, who attempted to
speak to a policeman. The nurses at once indicated
to John Hop that their charge was mentally
afflicted, and John let them go. Recently, arriving
from the country at the Central station, I noticed a
man with the marks of the brute in his face, lurking
—there is no other word —at the exit of the platform
and carefully scrutinising every girl who arrived
unaccompanied. I could not wait long, nor could I
do anything; but the memory of that man’s face
and his demeanor remains.
All imagination, perhaps; all foolish gossip. But
the suspicion is there. We do not hear anything
from the victims of a successful coup ; all we hear
of are suspicious cases where the girls had enough
sense to decline the proposals. And these, of course,
prove nothing. Yet here is a case that is more
than merely suspicious. A girl was waiting to meet
her “boy” one evening in William-street. There
was a crowd, and suddenly she felt a slight
pin-prick on her arm. She thought nothing of it;
but when she met her “boy” a couple of minutes
later she remarked that she was strangely dizzy, and
felt about to faint. Her friend took her into a
chemist’s shop. The chemist asked if she had felt a
pin-prick on her arm, examined the slight puncture,
and told her that he had had other similar cases.
The suggestion, of course, is that she had been doped
by a hypodermic injection, that if she had not for-
tunately met her friend so soon she would have
fainted', and the gentleman with the hypodermic
syringe (or whatever it was) would have claimed
lier as his sister or wife, and have got her put into a
taxi at once and gone off with her.
It has been said that a girl is quite safe as long
as sue does not speak to any strange man or woman ;
but if the suggestion underlying this last alleged
case is true, the most careful girl would have little
chance. The only method of combating this traffic —
if it exists —is publicity. Here was Miss Mona West,
a girl well known to a large circle of friends, among
whom it is reported she had said that she was
worried nearly every time she went out by a certain
man, disappearing absolutely in the city. Her
guardians inform the police, but shrink from pub-
licity. And now that the police have proved in-
capable of finding her. thev give the girl’s portrait
to the papers. Immediately people arrive who state
that they had seen a girl resembling her at various
places a fortnight or less ago. Had the facts been
made promptly public one or more of these alleged
clues could have been followed up. A false sense of
shame has probably helped her abductors to bestow
her safely out of the way—if she has been abducted.
The William-street case suggests that in every case
of a woman fainting in the streets, the public should
see that' the police are called and every precaution
taken to prevent her being spirited away. Australia
should be the paradise of White Slavers, since the
very independence of Australian girls, their proud
belief in their own ability to take care of themselves,
throws them into the hands of men and women in-
finitely skilled in their trade.
Tobacco and a Trust.
For the prosecution, “Namoi” testifies as
fellows
* There is we.eping and howling among the tobacco
growers of the Tamworth and Manilla districts of
N. S. Wales,, and this is the way of it.
For the lasij few years the tobacco-growing industry
has flourished until it has reached fair dimensions;
now, alas, it has received such a crack that, after
this season, it threatens to die right out unless a
thumping import duty is put on imported leaf.
The growing was started by Chinese, on shares
with farmers who had suitable land ; and the returns
proved so good that many white men are themselves
now growing the leaf. The only market is the
Tobacco Trust, except for a very small quantity
which finds its way to Queensland. Ihe Truat has,
through its buyers, urged the growth of the leaf, and
the Department of Agriculture has not been behind-
hand in doing likewise. The average price paid in
1912 was 9d. per lb. —good quality leaf brought Is.
and over, which paid the grower handsomely. Only
last year a Trust buyer, in answer to a question by a
newspaper man, “Could the tobacco-growing industry
be overdone?’’ assured him that, provided a good
quality leaf was produced, there would always be a
ready market for it. With such a rosy outlook, a lot
of land capable of growing lucerne and wheat was
sown with tobacco. Bores were put down for water,
irrigation plants were erected, ground was prepared
and the number of growers multiplied.
Wait here while the above-mentioned clout is
delivered.... Now go on.
The Trust buyer usually appears about the month
of August each year. But this year there was no
buyer in August. ” A month went by. Still no buyer.
Then mutterings commenced, which presently became
a yell, so loud and long that even the Trust gave ear,
and informed the growers that it didn’t want any
more tobacco —it was already overstocked. But the
howl increased so much that at last a Trust buyer
did appear—two months after his usual time, which
didn’t improve the tobacco leaf, as the growers have
no proper storing facilities and the leaf deteriorates
when it isn’t properly stored. The buyer again
informed the growers that the Trust had all the leaf
it wanted, and he was not anxious to buy. Still lie
would do what he could, and would look at the best
leaf. One grower was lucky enough to get 7£d. per
lb. for leaf which would have brought Is. the year
before. He received his cheque, and some advice not
to grow any more for three or four years. He is
saying hard things now about the Trust, as all his
plants are practically ready for setting-out for next
season’s crop. Another would-be grower has .lust
spent close on £lOOO in preparing ground, plant,
etc. He’s not mad. At least, not yet. These are
not isolated cases. There are others.
Thus the tobacco industry, so flourishing a few
months ago, is completely up a tree. The reason
seems obvious. Whilst Labor held sway in the
Federal House, the Trust encouraged the growth of
tobacco, for it feared an import duty on imported
leaf, and its tobacco leaf would have to come from
somewhere. But immediately the Liberal party got
into power, with Freetrade, Anti-Referenda Joe Cook
at its head, the Trust goes for American leaf without
fear of being smitten by a duty that means business.
Later on, when the pendulum swings back, the
local grower may be wanted again. Till then he
may go hang.
The whole case for No-license under local
option conditions was given away last week
in N. S. Wales by Archdeacon Boyce in the
most barefaced manner. The crowd which
the Archdeacon leads says that its object is
to save the drunkard, and, according to
Boyce, in a letter to the Telegraph, this is
how it proposes to effect the salvation :
It is, of course, known that drink could be bought
outside and brought into a No-license electorate. A
workman, for example, if he does not vote No-license,
could send to Sydney for a couple of gallons of beer,
costing only 3s. or 4s. It would be cheaper than
getting it from a local publican. He would be very
poverty-stricken indeed if he could not afford a
small sum like that. The rich man could do the
same, though nrobably he would buy more expensive
liquors as he does now. The No-license law does not
discriminate between the wealthy ones and the
laborer, and it is all nonsense to call it class legis-
lation.
So there you are! Close the bars where you
drink your pint and go home and din your
head in the family keg. Thus shall the
drunkard be reclaimed and the rising genera-
tion saved from the tempter !

A CURIOUS position arose amongst the
shearers’ union leaders in Maoriland over
the waterside workers’ strike. T ( he Federa-
tion of Labor reckoned on the wool-barbers
as a strong card, but when they were invited
by the strike committee to sky the scissors,
the executive of the union refused to allow
the call to go to the men. So peace reigned
until suddenly the organisers of the union
cut loose and resigned in a phalanx—the
whole three of them. They explained their
position thus :
Our executive’s action practically amounts to a
command that the shearers must scab on the organ-
ised Labor movement of this Dominion. And we
dare not do it. In Australia we have built up a
reputation for clean unionism—the Australian shear-
ers have never yet been guilty of organised scabberv
—and neither they nor the shearers of Maoriland
desire to carry the stigma n0w....0ur members are
instructed that they must remain in the sheds to
shear the wool from the backs of the sheep belong-
ing to scab special constables, wool that will be
duly loaded by scabs who are sworn in as specials,
cargo that no unionist will touch when it gets to
other ports.... Let us declare, once and for all, that
no executive mandate shall ever make us act the
part of traitors to the class that gave us birth, the
class in which our only hope of emancipation lies.
Well, put it this way. The organised Labor
movement sought for and obtained arbitra-
tion. Arbitration is the Labor policy. Cer-
tain enemies of the organised Labor move-
ment, however, struck against Arbitration.
The question now is, Ought those three
organisers to be loyal to the organised Labor
movement, or should they “scab” on ir and
be loyal to the rebels? They have preferred
to be loyal to the rebels. Very good ; but let
them now drop their professions of loyalty
to the organised Labor movement.

spent more than England. English figures
of this year are £5,959,561 higher than for
1904. Every other Power except Italy and
Austria has put on more than that. Ger-
many has increased £12,934,194; Russia,
£12,299,548; the United States, £9,318,557;
France, £8,465,330 ; Japan, £7,758,364 ; Italy,
£5,157,846; Austria, £3,391,091. Thus Italy
puts on nearly as much as England. Ger-
many spends 127 per cent, more than in
1904; the English increase is only 13 per
cent. Japan’s increase is 366 per cent.,
Austria’s 130, Italy’s 102, Russia’s 101,
France’s 67, Uncle Sam’s 47. Germany’s
naval expenditure in 1901 was only
£9,530,000, against England’s £34,872,200;
now Germany’s is £22,876,675, against Eng-
land’s £46,309,300. No doubt the thing
must stop somewhere. But it seems most
likely that it will only stop as the result of
the weaker ones dropping out and going
under. We have seen firms struggling for
the mastery—spending tens of thousands in
advertising, more tens of thousands in de-
vious ways. We have said, as that money
was poured out, the thing must have an end;
and so it has had an end, but generally
through the collapse of the weakest, and the
triumph of the few who could last longest.

The N.S.W. party of platform-breakers and
Labor renegades has done The Bulletin the
justice of issuing a leaflet making it clear
that this paper is not with them in their
present rebellion against the Labor policy.
The writer of the leaflet professes not to
understand how The Bulletin can be op-
posed to borrowing. There was a time, it
says, when the owners had to borrow to keep
going. “Without borrowing, The Bulletin
itself would be non-existent.” And he wants
to know how The Bulletin can denounce
for the country the policy that saved itself
and made it prosperous. It is quite true
that the time once came when The Bulletin
had to borrow or go out. And it was able
to borrow because it hadn’t exhausted its
borrowing powers before the crisis came.
The time may come when Australia will
have to borrow or go out. Yet these traitors
to the Labor policy and these enemies of
Australia are exhausting the country’s bor-
rowing powers before the crisis comes.
Those powers are already so nearly ex-
hausted that within a few pence of 5 per cent,
is being paid for money, and even
at that rate loans are got with difficulty.
Further, if The Bulletin borrowed, it
repaid. It didn’t go on drifting further and
further into debt. It didn’t start off by say-
ing that it would only borrow for interest-
earning works, and then borrow more madly
than ever when the works didn’t show inter-
est. In fact, it did exactly what the Labor
platform directed the Labor Government to
do; and it is because the Labor Govern-
ment has done the very opposite that this
paper denounces the present Ministers as the
worst enemies of the Labor movement in
N. S. Wales.
The Adelaide Art Gallery has bought, out

“Pink Tape”: Apart from pensions to
Judges and others under the Constitution
Act, N. S. Wales is paying away to retired
public servants no less than £157,000 a year,
while the revenue from present contributors
to the old superannuation scheme is only
£13,000. As these contributors will be com-
ing on to the fund at a quicker rate than
the present pensioners die off, Ma State will
have to foot a hefty bill yet before the in-
cubus of that crippled scheme is lifted. There
are now about 600 pensioners of various
ages, ranging from 40 to 92., the most strik-
ing on the list being W. M. M. (Monty)
Arnold, who, in a moribund condition in
1890, laid down the cares of office. Making
a magnificent recovery, Monty, then 39, has
drawn a pension of £192 for 23 years, and
looks good for another 23.
The Rev. Simeon Uppercut’s remarks: —
The Lemon Faces have been sadder than ever
lately in Sydney. Recently they were confronted
with some advertisements on the ferry boats anent
the sparkle of ales and the invigorating- qualities of
Old Tom gin. Very promptly a deputation held up
the manager at the point of the brolly and groaned
a fervent protest. He offered the poor consolation
of saying he would forward the groan to the direc-
tors. Meanwhile, he explained, the advertisements
had been sanctioned in order to meet the drain on
the unfortunate co.’s purse caused by the Government
insisting on larger quantities of lifebelts being
carried on the boats. It’ll take a lot of groaning
to tear the Sydney Ferries from revenue. Next
trouble the holy children suffered came from the
City Council, when it was announced that the Exhi-
bition Building in Prince Alfred Park had been
leased to the ever-green Larry Foley at £2600 a
year. Adding Larry and the tidy rental together,
the cry went up: “More prize fights!” No offer was
made, however, to give £3OOO for the building and
run therein choir practice and bun battles; and, as
the Council must obtain more money from its assets
or raise the rates, the prospects of Larry having his
contract cancelled are insignificant. Brethren, 1 we
will now sing the old favorite, “Here we suffer grief
and pain.”

The Quinlan Opera Co. gave its third and

“Louise” on Saturday night. The chorus
work was notably good in the dressmaker’s
non-sewing room scene. Gladys Ancrum’s
soprano pipe led the workgirls in song. The
sewing suffered so much in consequence that
there’s only a remote prospect of so much as
one pink sleeve being finished by the end of

and others at the Little Theatre. The
moral influence of Wilton Welch’s produc-
tion and of Louise Carbasse’s acting is be-
coming apparent. Quite a number of
bishops, hitherto in the White Slave busi-
ness, have promised to turn over a new leaf
and have nothing more to do with it.

The Society of Artists, whose annual
show is at Queen Victoria Markets (Syd-
ney), has been drawing cheques during the
week—which is the most payable form of
art. _ E. Griiner, whose beautiful canvas,
“Spring Morning, Sydney Harbor,” was
bought for presentation to Russell French,
of the Bank of N. S. Wales, has been given
a commission to do another painting for the
big financial house. Other commissions have
come to budding brushes, and the Society is
treating itself to an extra cup of tobacco
and an additional pipeful of tea. And if
Griiner collects the Wynne prize, as is hoped,
the applause will be deafening.

The Bulletin takes George Reid’s word
for it that the White City at Rushcutter’s
Bay, Sydney, could, “for absolute beauty of
design, challenge comparison with the Great
White City in London. For brilliancy, for
beauty, for convenience, for attractive-
ness it [Sydney’s show] seemed to
him to stand almost alone in the
world to-day.” This was said at the
private view last Friday night, and the other
showmen on the platform said “Hear, hear”
vigorously, and discovered on the instant the
uses of a High Commissioner. Anyhow, the
new amusement park, which is 10 acres in ex-
tent, is beautifully arranged and lighted, and
the amusement scheme is very comprehensive.
The opening of the park to the public was
fixed for last Saturday night, but had to be
pushed forward until too late a day of this
week to allow The Bulletin to express any
opinion on the scenic railway, switchbacks,
mysteries, illusions, glorified merry-go-rounds,
underground river and other diversions.
They seem to be just the thing for the
summer, though.

This week the Tivoli depends on two re-
vivals —Willette Whitaker and Frank Fox.
Both have, on a previous occasion, called
for complimentary remarks from this paper,
and there is no reason why that former
ruling should be set aside now. In the
remote contingency of both Miss Whitaker
and F. Fox going on the land, the Tivoli
will still have, among others, the Five Pet-
leys, Rosa Roma, the Golden Troupe and the
Richards to rely on.

The Australian drama manages somehow
to get a hearing. The newest occurs at the
Repertory Theatre, on December 10, when
Clarence Lee’s Anglo-Australian comedy-
drama, “The Girl with the Diamonds,” will
appear before a Sydney audience.

West’s, Ltd., has secured the 8000 ft. film
representation of “Germinal,” held by many
critics to be Emile Zola’s greatest work.
This much is certain, that modern literature
does not possess such a dramatic story of a
great industrial strike, and the film is
claimed to be a faithful portrayal of the
story. It will be produced on Saturday at
the Glaeiarium and Olympia.

If the show at the National were shifted
into the Y.M.C.A. building; and Dan Green

Miss Mona Drury were to warble “Don’t

and Police Inspector Day chanted “We’re

of half a column. As it is, it can merely
repeat that there is not much to be said
about the Sydney music hall that wasn’t

that the play is unduly kind to Peggy and
her cold-blooded George—the trustful hus-
band who stands aside to watch her being
led into a trap—and unduly unkind to Col-
lingwood. the magnanimous philanderer, who
is made to look like a fool. For the in-
tensely romantic lover in “The Liars” there
is every excuse. Any man of his sort might
have been fooled by the sort of married
woman who eventually throws him over.
For Colling wood’s foolishness, on the other
hand, there is no excuse. The play leaves
him without reasonable grounds for his
error of judgment. On Saturday week
(13th) Lewis Waller and Madge Tither-
adee will appear for the first Australian
time in a romantic drama titled “Miss
Elizabeth’s Prisoner.”
Princess Stephanie of Balaria is the
heroine of “The Balkan Princess,” now pro-
ceeding at Her Majesty’s in Melbourne, and
that enthusiastic lady’s hunt for a husband
is the feeble excuse for involving her in
more or less musical complications. As in for-
mer disturbances of the sort, the Princess
turns her matrimonial eye on a queer assort-
ment of dukes, barons and other refuse from
the Almanach de Gotha, and finally selects
the least eligible of the crowd for the usual
privileges of sharing her throne and cash-
box, and resting his feet on the royal furni-
ture. The successful candidate, Duke Ser-
gius of Balaria, is the conventional type of
aristocratic waster, generally frequenting a
Bohemian cafo where giddy girls turn the
night into noise and chase away the cares
of dyspeptic diners. The happenings in this
resort are much like the events in other
stage cafos, and when the Princess turns up
to discover the Duke frivolling with the pre-
vailing favorite of his wandering affections,
the story begins to wear a familiar aspect and
the expected starts to happen. The “book,”
however, doesn’t count for much, while
the _ slenderness of the music is just as
obvious as the cleverness with which it
avoids anything that is melodiously memor-
able. The main feature of the show is the
comedy business, often taking, never unbear-
able, and always safely conducted by Phil
Smith as Blatz and Robert Whyte, junior,
as Henry the waiter. Smith is a pleasant
improvement on his former impersonations,
and is very useful in pattering away the
time when the gentle music has gone on
strike or has fainted off. Whyte’s waiter
is unctuous low comedy of an entertaining
description, quaintly solemn and decorous.
On the vocal side the achievement of the
company is not so great. Even Miss Florence
Young, as Princess Stephanie, doesn’t sing
up to her reputation. Dramatically speak-
ing, Miss Young’s Princess is a stolid per-

for arch-fiend Ilerod on the Night Side of
London, but their peregrinations will end
this Friday. On Saturday another drama-

On Saturday also the American bur-
lesque crowd at the King’s will return to
their original characters in “The Grafters,”
and leave “A Day at the Races” to be re-

the entertainment first mentioned. “The
Grafters” is for a limited number of nights
only. The nights between now and
Christmas are not many, and all seasons in
the meantime are necessarily limited.
Noteworthy events in the musical world
are the postponement sine die of a Nordica
concert, owing to the sickness of the star
lady, and the final reappearance of John
McCormack at the Auditorium this (Thurs-
day) afternoon. Dr. Price directs a monthly
municipal concert at the Town Hall this
evening, and Clara Butt and Rumford will
warble good-bye songs at the Auditorium on
Saturday (6th). Next Tuesday night the

of Mrs. Pauli Carter, for whom a compli-
mentary concert with a monster programme
has been arranged.

In Adelaide the familiar humors of
“Our Selection” are at the Royal. Bailey

Edith Mote sings well, but her strong point
is the quick change of costumes. Dixie

ing or making a stump oration- and not

strolls easily up to the gallery, holding a
rope with prehensile toes, and the acrobatic
turns are good. The Primrose hour are
again at the Tivoli; also Lillie Langtry,
whose account of the Faggot next door is a
true piece of artistry in its own line. Rey-
nolds and Donegan contrive to be both ath-
letic and graceful on skates, and the banton
athletes could be borne with in a much
longer act. The Literary Theatre has made
an unaccountable change in its policy or
giving fresh plays, and has revived an old
success. “The Servant in the House, with

AT POVERTY POINT.
E. J. Carroll, of Queensland, will play a strong
hand in the theatrical enterprises of Australasia dur-
ing 1914, and later. A few days ago he returned
from America and Britain with a pocket-full of con-
tracts so important as to put him somewhere in
the first flight of management. The first attraction
will be “Bunty Pulls the Strings,” which, under
arrangement with J. C. Williamson, Ltd., will be
played by Graham Moffat’s company of Scotch players
in the firm’s theatres. “Bunty” has brought loads
of money to Moffat (author and producer). It ran
500 nights at the London Haymarket and 10 months
in New York. Carroll has also secured “The Rosary,”
by' Edward E. Rose, and it will be played by an
English co. headed by Australia’s old friend, Harring-
ton Reynolds. Arrangements have been made with Wil-
liam Morris to despatch another English co. with “The
Blindness of Fate,” by Cosmo Hamilton. Morris,
who owns the New York Theatre, Broadway, and a
string of others, is reckoned one of the most enter-
prising managers in America. Le Roy, Talma and
Bosco (26 people) and Victor Hugo’s American Dog
and Pony Show complete the 1914 programme.
“Stalls”: Th ( e Williamson firm imported 10 “show
girls” the other day. In the name of Heaven, why ?
Australia is teeming with superbly tall and beauti-
ful I ,'young women who, in the matter of allurement,
fairly lose any of the overseas charmers whom this
country has seen hitherto. No female imports
equalled in beauty the Beard sisters —now, alas, gone
from our midst for ever, dear brethren. And there
is a more or less new arrival in the comic opera co.
in Melbourne —Nancy Anderson by name —whose slim
loveliness would fill London or Paris with joy.
“Iris”: A word in response to “Jeames” (B.
13/11/’l3) apropos the recent works of Jones and
Pinero being failures. I don’t say anything for
Jones; but with regard to Pinero, after having held
pride of place in England as a dramatist for 20 years
or more, he has recently turhed his attention to
America, where his later works are as successful as
his earlier ones were in England. Among these
American successes are “The Thunderbolt,” “Mid-
Channel,” “Mr. Panmure,” and, lately, “The Mind
the Paint Girl.” Their somewhat tepid reception in
England was due not to a fallihg-off on the part of the
author, but to the stodgy intellect of the English,
who can never be persuaded Of their weaknesses or
their mistakes, and under no circumstances can enjoy
a joke at their own expense. So America laughs
heartily, likewise Germany (in the case of “The
Mind the Paipt Girl”), and Pinero scores. It is
a matter of indifference to him where his successes
occur.
George Portus, who has been helping to keep the
banner flying from the Tivoli citadel during the
absence of Hugh D. Mclntosh in Britain and there-
abouts, has been appointed manager of the firm’s
new theatre in Adelaide.
Dorothy Brunton is beginning to get the recogni-
tion that has long been her due from the J.C.W. firm. In
future she is to play Sombra, the big part in “The
Arcadians”; lilagda in “The Balkan Princess”;
Mascha in “The Chocolate Soldier” ; and Juliette in
“Luxembourg.” This is a big achievement for one
of her age, and a stupendous one when it is recol-
lected that she is a local product. It is easier for
a dipsomaniac to pass by free alcohol than for a
native born and trained artist to get ahead of the
imported star in a Williamson troupe.
“Nemo”: One of the best fellows on the Victorian
Supreme Court Bench is Justice Hood, and people
who know him will be glad of the success of his
daughter, Florence, who has just got the diploma of
the Meisterschule of Vienna. She is a violinist. Miss
Hood has beep away in Austria several years, but
revisted Australia, her native country, recently, ap-
pearing at concerts in Melbourne and Sydney. She
means to remain some years more in Europe, study-
ing music, which is to be her profession. She
has all the Irish talent for music and all
the brilliancy of the Hibernian when he or she suc-
ceeds at all. Her grandfather was an Irish apothe-
cary in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne. Everybody in
the old days knew “Hood’s.”
Maoriland, when it can forget the strike, feels
good, because its sweetest singer, Rosina Buck-
mann, is to have a chance at Covent Garden next
year in grand opera. Melba told the Maorilanders
two years or so ago that Miss Buckmann would
“surely gather the laurel wreath for herself,” and
predicted a great future for her, and when John
McCormack said to them, “She’s got the goods—
send her to London,” they shelled out fvith acclama-
tion.
“Gazer”: Two prima donnas have lately demanded
footlights on concert platforms, and the infliction
threaten to spread. One night last week, at the
opening of the Nordica farewell season, Walter
Kirby lifted up his melodious voice with the glare
full on him. The effect was disastrous. Kirby’s
Kaiser moustachios, fierce enough at any time, were
distorted so appallingly that his sweetly-sung no-
things irresistibly suggested the treacherous wheed-
lings of a land-agent. Big Ken Rumford resolutely
refused, when doing his solo work, to face the pest.
Indeed, one night he literally turned tail before the
disfiguring glow, and held up an audience till the
nuisance was abolished. During the inevitable duet
number, when Mrs. Ken was bathed in the added
illumination, there was always an unmistakable feel-
ing of ructions in the air, the brave baritone get-
ting as far from the torture as possible, and going
through “The Keys of Heaven’’ in obvious agony.
Great the power that could ruffle the sea of that
marital bark 1
“Riverstone”: “Left Hand,” speaking of Canadian
artistic effort, says that the result of a stock
dramatic co. presenting a new play every week is
too vile to detail. That does not accord with the
experience of the Comedie Francaise, or the stock
companies of our youth. In the writer’s experience,
a good actor plays at his best on the second or third
representation. His whole soul is then in his part ;
he is awake to the novelty of it. Frequent repeti-
tion blunts his own interest, and, by sympathy, that
of the audience. Actors forget even their words if
they say them often enough. Personally I have
abandoned the theatre as an entertainment since the
era of long runs; for only here and there does an
artist survive the depressing effect. But I delight
in the recollection of a stock co. at Hobart, which
staged two or three different plays a week, using
the same limited scenfjry and wardrobe over and over
again. The interest then depended on the acting,
and under those conditions the players did act.
They were alive. The success of the Repertory
Theatres is largely due to the disgust intelligent
people have for present methods; and these methods
are only profitable with long runs.
“V.H.C.”: The songs you hear nowanights at the
St. Kilda Dandies are like the bread after a baker’s
holiday. The funny man’s specialties include “Cheap
Sea Trips,” done to death by Thomas’s Pierrots two
years ago; also “Months and Months and Months,”
which Jimmy Campbell used to do in infinitely
funnier fashion years and years and years ago.
Neither song has improved with age. Other items,
“That’s so, Papa,” and “Semi-detached,” have the
dust thick upon them. Branscombe’s prices are
high enough, and when he bumps them up higher on
Saturday nights, it makes us feel that we want some-
thing better for our money than songs which have
been worn as flat as the heel of last year’s boot.
The best six English actors living are, on the
verdict of a vote by readers of London Truth, Tree,
Alexander, Wyndham, Bourchier, H. B. Irving and
Martin Harvey. The odd thing is that, though these
had a clear majority on the bulk vote, not one indi-
vidual vQter named just those six. There was spirited
support for Waller, Hawtrey, Hare, Cyril Maude,
Forbes Robertson, Seymour Hicks, Fred Terry and
Du Maurier; and Grossmith, Asche, James Welch,
Grativille Barker and Benson also had friends.
“S.”: A plucky attempt to give grand opera in the
U.S.A. at cheap prices, and in English, has run
against a snag. A £60,000 subsidy, guaranteed for
three years by an artistic batch of millionaires,
keeps the wolf from the door ; but the singers declare
that the consonants which abound in Anglo-Saxon
play up with their voices, wherefore they begin to
decline contracts that compel English in heavy
opera. “This sword thrust through” is given as a
type of the phrase that no respectable voice can take
on a really high note without feeling unwell after-
wards.
“Stargazer”: My favorite waiter at a popular Mel-
bourne restaurant, a pale Teuton with a family
resemblance to Marguerite, and the gentlest manner
this side Kingdom Come, tells me this story: “You
Blank know dot play mit der biano —yes? He coom
here somedime to his lunch haff. Dot is de day ven
Madame Melpa she is here. 1 go me to see Madame
Melpa sing. Loofly ! Der vos no one sing as Melpa
the same. She ring in mein ear all day. Ven
Blank he sit himseluf at my table I say him too:
‘Goot day,’ I say. He grunt. Ven feesh is serve, I
say about Madame Melpa: ‘You like our sonk pird
very much—yes?’ Blank he no look up from der
flathet; he say: ‘Tanks, no poultry!’”
“Giovanni”: A change has come over theatrical
advts. in the London papers. The modest inch
giving only the title of the piece, the names of the
seven authors, and the cast, is disappearing before
huge illustrated advertisements, sometimes covering
half a page. The noisiest offenders at the moment
are “The Pearl Girl,” who has published most of
her libretto in heavy type, and “This Way, Madam,”
whose advertisements read like the last days of a
millinery sale. Melodrama is also having a cut in.
This- is how the invitations to “The Beggar Girl’s
Wedding” are worded: “Full of Melvillian charac-
terisations. London’s rich and poor. Women, cards
and wine. The road to ruin,” etc. Evidently it
is not going to be a dull ceremony. The next
Ibsen revival will be notified like this: “Are you a
pessimist? If not, see ‘Hedda Gabler.’ Morbid,
yearning, neurotic, suicidal. Why not die?” And
the musical comedy of the future will make this
appeal: “It is estimated that if all the hose shown
in the ‘Girl from Gorridge’s’ were tied end to end,
the resultant silken rope would stretch from West-
minster Abbey to St. Paul’s Cathedral.”
“C. Ockney”: At the annual meeting of Drury
Lane, Limited, last month, a divvy of 10 per cent,
was declared, the profit for the year being £23,960.
It would, in all probability, have been more had
managing-director Arthur Collins staged his usual
autumn Hamilton-Raleigh drama Snstead of the
fancy-dress “morality,” “Everywoman.” Remarked
Collins, speaking of his “breakaway from tradition” :
“Though I was praised for my artistic endeavor,
that ‘cut no ice.’ After the first few weeks of
‘Evervwoman’ the audiences each night grew smaller
by degrees and beautifully less.” Which serves to
show that the B.P. didn’t bite at the much-boomed
piece any more than Australian playgoers.
From “Bunty Pulls the Strings,” which E. J.
Carroll, will shortly introduce to Australia: “Weel,
how’s the wife?” “The wife’s a’ right, but the
coo’s bad.” So N. S. Wales isn’t the only place
where they worship the horned goddess.
Jimmy Glover, the conductor of Drury Lane
orchestra, London, has perpetrated a second seven-
and-sixpenny volume of reminiscences. He was behind
the scenes at the first “Royal Command” variety per-
formance at London Palace, and this is his uncandied
opinion of it: “What a night it was! A night of
dullness, voiceless artists and uncomic comedians!
There never was a more unhappy exhibition of talent
mixed up with mediocrity, tempered with jealousy.
The curtain came down with a dull thud, without a
laugh or a smile or a congratulation, and, of course,
without a knighthood.” A malicious little dig this
last remark, because it was generally believed that
George V. would knight Alfred Britt, the manager,
at the close of the performance.
“Hamlet,” as acted by Forbes Robertson for mov-
ing-picture purposes, seems to make a quite unex-
pectedly good melodrama. It runs on the film for
about an hour and a half. Now an Italian co. has
filmed “Antony and Cleopatra,” with the usual massed
crowds and elaborate scenic effects of Italian work.
Also, the producers improve on Shakspeare, and in-
troduce a beautiful slave girl, whom the jealous Cleo-
patra has first flogged on the bare back and then
hurled to the Nile crocodiles!
“Private Boxer”: America was to the fore at the
opening of the London autumn season with atotal ot
seven plays ; but, with the exception of “Within tne
Law” at the Haymarket, and “Never Say Die at tne
Apollo, which by latest advices are still going strong,
there was nothing remarkable about the bunch ex-
cept the shortness of the runs. “Girls ’ appealed tor
support for one week only, and then turned the job
up. “The Scarlet Band” (known first in t« e States
as “The Conspiracy”) could no do more than hobble
along for 36 performances; “Years of Discretion, at
the Globe, even with the admirable Ethel _lrvmg
in the cast, cried enough after 31.
Game,” at the New, was played 20 times, and lhe
Barrier,” at the Strand, was just getting into the
90’s when the closure was applied.
“Norbell”: Our dramatic co. proposed to perpe-
trate “East Lynne” at Cowshed Creek, and the
manager aproached Mr. Terence McCarthy, of the
Leg-rope Arms, for the loan of his talented son
Mickey to play Little Willie. Mr. McCarthy was
very proud of Mickey, and, for urgent financial reasons,
it was considered advisable to gain McCarthy’s good-
will. We made the request by way of delicate com-
pliment. The fond father consented willingly. “Yis,
said he, “yez can have Mickey. Mind ye, it’s the
great gift he have. Yez should hear him sing, Im
a light-hearted Paddv, an’ do a jig. Sure, Madame
Milba couldn’t do it better.” Mickey duly rehearsed,
and, before the show, prompted by his pa, he came
to a private understanding with the pianist, a local
artist who owed McCarthy money. When the
momentous hour arrived, Mickey looked almost pre-
sentable; his fiery, untamed hair was currycombed
and plastered down with lard, his leopard-spot
freckles were partly hiden under No. 1 i flesh grease-
paint, and he was otherwise disguised in a clean
white jumper and green ribbons. The play proceeded
on its tearful way, and all went well until Lady
Isabel’s elopement. Mr. Horatio Buskem, as Archi-
bald Carlyle, had just sobbed through the erring
Isabel’s farewell letter, when Little Willie made his
appointed entrance. “Papa, papa,” prattled he,
“where is my mamma?” “My boy! my che-ild!
wailed Archibald, “she has gone away. You have
no mamma now!” Then said the incorrigible
Mickey: “My mother gone ! Then here’s me chance
to show vou me song and dance!” And he did!
Little Willie encouraged the pianist with a “Let her
go, Professor!” and sang “I’m a light-hearted
Paddy,” and danced his renowned jig, to the confu-
sion of the co., but to the great gladness of the
audience, which included Mr. Terence McCarthy in
the front seat.

In the House of Reps, the other night:—
W. M. Hughes: The hon. member (Jokook) would
cut the words of the Redeemer Himself in halves.
The Speaker: I would ask the hon. member not to
use language of this kind.
Mr. Fisher: What language?
The Sneaker: I do not think it is fit that the name
of the Redeemer should be brought into debates as it
has been.
It recalls the police-court scene: —
Witness: It’s the God’s truth, your Worship.
His Worship: Silence! We don’t want any of that
here!
“F.”: The dead limit was reached when
Wowserdom of Horsham (Vic.) censured
Frank Tate, Director of Education, for the
crime of spending a Sunday driving out to
see the Wartook Reservoir. Those who know
Horsham on a Sunday would have exculpated
him had he driven out even to see a dead dog.
Sunday in Horsham! The only simile I
can think of is a century in Hades. Still,
he deserved censure. What did he want to
drive out to the reservoir for, when there
was better liquor at the pub he was staying
at?
The Adelaide to Brighton railway was
quietly opened to traffic last week. It is
merely a suburban line, less than 10 miles in
length, but is important as being the first and
easiest bit of a bigger thing. The line already
under construction leaves the plain at Brigh-
ton, and is to climb over the hills (which
there come down to the sea) into the rich
Reynella, Noarlunga and Maclaren Vale dis-
trict. Willunga, 30 miles out, is the present
scheme’s terminus, but .the rails will cer-
tainly be pushed on before long to the cliffs
of Cape Jervis, opposite Kangaroo Island.
Well-managed municipal Socialism is a
profitable outrage. The Perth city auditor
reports that the council, which took over
the Perth Gas Co.’s affairs a year ago, made
£30,768 clear profit on that business during
the 12 months ended October 31. The Lib-
eral suburbanite who finds his bank account
withering under the influence of increased
rates and inflated gas-bills might think it
over. No council or group of councils with
a golden river of cash flowing from a gas
treasury would need to hit the consumers
with increased rates; and there would also be
more loose cash available for the repair of
the roads on which the suburbanite occa-
sionally breaks his neck while hurrying to
pay his taxes.
The mostly-Tory daily press of Australia
is hard put to it to find language to express
its opinion of the Senate just now ; and its
struggles make humorous reading when one
recalls the eulogies showered upon that
House when Federation was going through
the mould. In those days it was “Billy”
Hughes and Labor that howled against the
Senate, while the Tory press declared it
was to be a glorious institution, the very
keep and stronghold of Liberalism; the
guardian of State Rights; a glorified and
more splendid Legislative Council, “broad-
based on the will of all the people of all the
States.” It was thought that Labor would
be powerless in the vast electorate wherein
a whole State voted as one constituency. No
Labor man could get over the ground, it was
believed ; so the Senate would be a house
composed absolutely of “men who had done
some good for themselves.” In other words,
only rich men would have a chance of being
Senators. But the very reverse has hap-
pened ; for while the Liberal organisation
counts for little in the country, the Labor
organisation counts everywhere, and thus to-
day the Senate is the stronghold of Labor.
Time’s whirligig!

which engaged her. — Ciible.
We’ve seen the noble actor dare
The dangers of the mighty sea,
The furies of the earth and air,
And all the wiles of villainy ;
We've seen him show no trace of awe
Confronted by the imps of Hell,
We’ve seen him face a buzzing saw,
And final horrors of the law —
And, Heavens! he has done it well.
But that was acting; nothing true
Was in the dangers that he ran.
The fearful creatures whom he slew
Were wobbly monsters stuffed with bran.
But times are changing, manners, too ;
The actor who has lived on skite
Must drop the game, or dare to do
With fires that crackle, and pursue
Enormous lions that can bite.
The flickergraph demands of him
The courage he has faked so long ;
Since people want the picture film,
Our actors must be stout and strong.
Take risks by flood and field, face mad
Old lions in the wilds and beat ’em.
’Tis well; for now, if they’re as bad
As they have been, we’ll all be glad
To see the hungry lions eat ’em !

BILL (watching Government House parly):
“Rotten bad shot , ain't he?”
JIM: “ Yairs, that's why I give ’im blank
cartridges! ”
The champion bogus mourner got 12
months last week in Melbourne. One day
in March, when the year was feeling very
sick and the wind was chill, he wafted him-
self into a woman florist’s shop on the hill
that the funerals climb on the way to Ivew
and sadly ordered four wreaths for his de-
parted wife’s grave. He was so shaken with
grief that the trader in sad, white blooms was
quite upset, and, as a consequence, was most
unbusinesslike. As he handed her his heart-
broken cheque for £1 10s. 6d., in payment
for the 16s. worth of emblems, he sobbed,
convulsively. When the 14s. 6d. change was
thrust into his hand, he mopped his eyes
hopelessly. Then he departed in a gust,
leaving the sympathetic florist thoroughly
depressed. When she had thought it over
and sighed, she looked wearily at the hope-
less mourner’s cheque, and was electrified
with honest rage, for the tear-stained,
crumpled document was just a valueless Sav-
ings Bank order. The captured weeper,
answering for his cheerless crime on the
threshold of the grave, offered no defence
beyond saying that “there was a woman at
the bottom of it.” Perhaps there was. But
she couldn’t have been the dead wife.
Across in Norfolk Island, when the Church
needs a little more help than usual, they put
a whale in the plate. Financial pressure
lately forced the Church of England and the
Methodists to send out a boat apiece in
search of Jonah’s friend; The Methodies
got their harpoon in first and landed the
whale safely. Five days later, the C.E. boat
made a kill and towed the grease ashore.
Total result, about £lOO worth of oil. This,
less £2O for exes., left £4O for each church.
Probably the Lord saw to it that the whales
were allotted evenly. A religious controversy
on a small island over two dead whales
would be more than Heaven itself could
bear.
The imperishable O’Neill, Victoria’s
wealthiest “vagrant,” was approached by the
law from a new angle last week, when the
authorities charged him with “using a cer-
tain place, to wit, box 51 at the P. 0., Bal-
larat, for purposes of betting.” Long and
expensive argument ensued as to whether a
letter box was or could be a place, the P.M.
ultimately deciding that it was, and fining
the harassed pauper £35, with £l6 2s. 6d.
costs. It would save a lot of legal time and
public money if Parliament curtly declared
that every thing, substance, situation, posi-
tion and locality on earth is a “place”
within the meaning of the Act. But these
are the obvious little things that Parliament
seems never to feel like doing, somehow.
Ecclesiastical note
Anglicanism has at present 20 diocesan bishops in
the Commonwealth—not counting Bishop Sharp, who
shepherds Black Brother in Australia’s dependency,
P'apua. Of these 20, the wearers of the gaiters in
the six State capitals were all directly imported for
their present jobs without previous Australian ex-
perience. These include the three existing arch-
bishops and one shortly-to-become archbishop (Perth).
The other 14 sees, in country districts or health re-
sorts like North Queensland and the Nor’-West, with
scanty incomes below that of many English rectories,
have been reckoned good enough for men who are
mere Australians either by birth or adoption.
Two new dioceses are now to be formed. The
present diocese of Grafton and Armidale (N.S.W.) is
to be subdivided, and Grafton given a bishop of its
own. He is to be elected at a Synod to meet in
Armidale on December 9. Bishop Cooper, who has
bossed the joint see since 1901, will stay at Armi-
dale. Two years ago, in furtherance of his policy of
filling up the best N.S.W. church positions with men
who will back him up in his vestments crusade,
Archgaiters Wright, of Sydney, imported a young
English parson named Druitt, and got him appointed
Coadjutor-Bishop of Grafton and Armidale, the idea
being to have him handy as first bishop of the
new see, and, being personally popular, he will go to
the post a hot favorite for the Bishopric Stakes on
December 9, though there are several other starters.
One of his strongest claims is that, by steady per-
sonal cadging in the districts, he has raised the en-
dowment required to produce the new bishop’s screw
and make the division of the diocese possible. Druitt
runs Bishop Long, of Bathurst, a close second for the
distinction of being the youngest Anglican prelate
in Australia. Both were born in 1874 —Druitt in
the Cold Land, Long in Victoria ; but Long saw the
light a couple of months later.
The other new bishopric is to be in W.A., where
Kalgoorlie is to have a pair of gaiters of its own.
Three-fourths of the endowment has been put up in
W.A., the rest having been cadged abroad. Bishop
Riley, of Perth< and Archbish. Wright, of Sydney,
have had a little dust-up over the matter. By Angli-
can law in Australia, when a State contains three
bishoprics it can become an ecclesiastical “province,’’
and its senior bishop, or “metropolitan,” is styled
Archbishop. But as Trower, of the Nor’-West,
had no Synod, Wright wouldn’t take the
necessary action. So Riley had to set to work
to raise another £lO,OOO and form a bishopric
in some place where a Synod could be held.
The result is the new Kalgoorlie See—-to be
known as “the Goldfields diocese,” since mines have
a habit of petering out, and there may be no such
place as Kalgoorlie in another half-century. Mean-
while, the R.C. Bishop of Perth has become an arch-
bishop, so that Riley will be the junior of the two.
All of which makes Archbish. Wright additionally
popular among W.A. Anglicans. If Archdeacon Col-
lick, of Kalgoorlie, becomes the first Bishop of the
Goldfields (as tipped in a recent Bulletin par.).,
Wowserdom will gnash its few remaining teeth.
Collick doesn’t generally waste time attending Synods,
being able to find something better worth doing;
but he turned up for the first time at a recent Perth
Synod, and made his presence felt by barracking
for Sunday sports, telling the assembled brethren
that rest didn’t mean rust, and that he could find
no commandment forbidding amusement on Sunday.
He carried his point, and caused an attempted resolu-
tion condemning Sunday sport to be amended. But
Wowserdom is not strong in W.A., where the Angli-
can parsons are mostly good sports of the “High”
variety. Its happv-hunting ground is in Sydney,
where brothers Yarrington and Boyce can give it
delightful thrills.
THE ALMTGHTY TRUTH.
MISTRESS: “Now, gel about your work and tell me no more falsehoods .” (A knock.)
“If that’s Mrs. Borer at the door tell her I'm not at home.”
“Lokohu”: They have a way of their own
in dealing with the mixed-marriage question
in Papua. The marriage law does not pre-
vent the fool-European linking himself with
any nondescript nigger; but the divorce ordi-
nance makes the link absolutely unbreakable.
“Do - it,” says the law in effect, “and you
remain a social outcast for ever.” Marriages
between white and color have not been very
numerous to date, and the Draconian divorce
law may possibly keep down the number in
the future, though, of course, there’s this to
be said —I don’t suppose anybody ever con-
templates divorce when he marries, and on
his wedding-day it wouldn’t trouble him if
there wasn’t a divorce law in the world.
Better than any, law to prevent miscegena-
tion is the fact that marriageable white
girls are coming into the land every boat;
so the planter or trader can now console
himself without also degrading 'himself.
Sydney Peace Society met last week and
contemplated with satisfaction the inspiring
details of the construction of the Palace of
Peace at the Hague. Miss Rose Scott re-
lated with pride that all the Governments of
the world had contributed to the embellish-
ment of the structure, which is understood
to mark the elevation of the lamb in man-
kind and the fall of the wolf. And outside
the calm, pacific atmosphere of the Peace
Society’s room the night quivered with the
demented howls of man pursuing his fellow
man all over the world with an axe in each
hand and a razor in his boot. On the far
Bolivian rubber fields the clotted lash mer-
cilessly drove the tribes to work or hell ;
from Tokio the warship Igsumi was roaring
across to Mexico, where 10,000 men
were pouring out their blood in civil war;
in America, the Navajo Indians and Uncle
Sam’s troops stood facing each other with
itching fingers on the magazine rifles; up
north, in Shanghai, the remains of the Kuo
Ming Tang party were organising a band of
assassins to kill the President and military
leaders; in the slaughter-house of mid-
Europe the Albanians were retreating from
the Montenegrins and marking the passage
with their dead and dying; and in Ulster
thousands of men were hurriedly beating
their ploughshares into bayonets in the
expectation of disembowelling their own
countrymen.
“Tom Noddy”: The wisdom of abolishing
canteens in military camps has been tested
again at Gisborne (Vic.). The result is
enough to make Bung sing Hallelujahs in
praise of the angel that watches over him.
The men poured into the township at night,
and drank more than they would have done
in camp—more, anyhow, than I have ever
seen them drink there. They staggered back
about nine, and then the officers took a turn.
With the old regimental canteen system, the
profits went to regimental funds, and so to
some extent benefited the booser. Now Bung
stands by and rubs his hands while the money
pours into his coffers. And all he is con-
cerned about is to make it a lot.

The skipper of the Sydney ferry-boat that
dodges the other juggernauts with great skill
and marvellous luck deserves the squarest
deal available. But, at night, particularly,
he doesn’t get even the oblong or rhomboid
variety of the goods. He accepts philosophi-
cally the half a million or so of red lights
and white lights that pirouette around him
on the water; also, he doesn’t put in an
extra watch cursing the blaze of shop and
street and tram lights along the sea front.
These he regards as inevitable in present
circumstances. But w T hen an infernal elec-
tric device flashes into his blinking vision
from the sky the advice to try lloordocker’s
Pills he does object. The City Council con-
trols the advertising lights around the har-
bor, and lately, responding to complaints
from the Navigation Department, it asked
its official surveyor to report. Mr. Gordon
couldn’t see how the signs could affect the
sight of the navigators, as they were too
high up; which suggests that Mr. Gordon
has never faced a fast bowler with an early
afternoon sun in front of him. So the
Works Committee of the City Council de-
cided to allow Hoofdocker to blaze away as
usual, and remarked cheerfully that it ex-
pected to soon draw £lO,OOO a year from the
various Hoofdockers. When the smash ar-
rives the victims will therefore have as their
last consolation the thought that Hoof-
docker’s specific is selling well, and the City
Council’s revenue is doing nicely.
CHID AND CHIC.—FASHIONS FOR
SYDNEY, 1914.
“Monicq” : I am not surprised at the in-
creasing prevalence of mysterious disappear-
ances of young women in Sydney. About
four have vanished during the last four
months as utterly as though carried off by
genii in the night. The modern motor-car
and motor-boat make the way of the wealthy
scoundrel easy. Take a case which came
under my own notice of late. In a fit of
curiosity 1 answered a matrimonial adver-
tisement in a daily paper. I received an en-
gaging reply ftom a gentleman who was
apparently affluent. He had a home of his
own kept by a housekeeper who was a lady
by birth and education. I could call and see
him there with perfect safety, and his house-
keeper would act as chaperone. He proposed
I should go there on Sunday for dinner. I
did not go, but 1 ferreted round that house
industriously till I got a glimpse of my
would-be lover. He came to the house in a
motor-car, stayed a few T minutes and emerged
reading a letter which I rather fancy I had
posted to him at that address the night be-
fore, and drove away smilingly. His pro-
fession was stamped all over him —a doctor
with a gilded practice. His alleged home
and lady housekeeper were entirely fabu-
lous. Truly he had a den at that address,
and if faces are anything to go by the lady
in charge of it would be a safe accomplice
in any crinte. Well, the doctor has fast
motor-cars ; also he has command of a motor-
boat capable of running out to sea. If that
gentleman got a girl into that place who was
likely to make a fuss afterwards, it would
rest entirely with him whether she came out
alive or not. His motor-car might provide
the means of removing the body to where his
motor-boat would be waiting, and the boat
might provide the means of an ocean burial.
The only thing he would have to guard
against would be his letters. If he could re-
cover them he would be safe, and the average
girl would carry all such clandestine corres-
pondence in her handbag. Altogether, the
personal advt. columns of the morning press
provide a pretty field of operations for nervy
and wealthy scoundrels.

Adelaide University has sustained the
first ofislaught of a woman candidate for
the Council —the governing body of 20,
elected by the graduates. Dr. Helen Mayo
was the advance-guard, and she was ill-
advised in not waiting for a real death-or-
retirement vacancy, such as occurs every
year or so. Five of the Council have to
chance re-election every November, and she
just butted in against this year’s batch.
They were all five good and useful men, and
naturally the majority of graduates did not
care to shunt any one of them for a new-
comer. So Dr. Mayo was practically re-
quested to call again when things are less
busy. South Aus. was the first University on
this continent to allow women to take degrees
(1880), as it was the first State to give them
votes (1893), and it is not likely long to
refuse them representation on the Council,
now they have claimed it.
“Bookware”: The new Melbourne Public
Library is under fire of criticism. The New
School finds it an enormous improvement, but
the Old School dislikes it.
The 30,000 books available
to readers without special
application have the stamp
of modernity, whereas the
volumes immediately avail-
able in the old library were
much more largely of a classic
order. This was the bias
given to the library by Red-
mond Barry and James
Smith. What the trade calls
“furniture” books —those
which “no gentleman’s li-
brary should be without,”
and which hardly anyone
reads —were then in the
foreground. Of course the
library is now more inviting
to the general public. The
arrangement is indeed
superb, with the whole octa-
gon of books under the eye
of an official in the central
desk. And the ensemble is
grand : viewed from the out-
side by night there is no
Melbourne building to equal
the Rotunda in its illumi-
nated magnificence. with
such liberal windowing.
The Sydney citizen who excuses his hiccup
by calling the gods to witness that, as he
had only one whisky all night, he must have
been doped with bad liquor, will do well to
keep the Police Report for 1912 (just pub-
lished) out of the hands of his wife. Other-
wise she might see this passage:—
Since the fixing of the standards of strength on
Nov 29, 1901, to Dec. 31, 1912, 4382 samples of
liquor have been taken by the licensing inspectors,
none of which was found to contain any deleterious
or injurious substances. The liquor was taken from
hotels situate all over the Metropolitan Licensing
district from bottles and vessels as being supplied
to customers in the ordinary way of business.
Thus does another old prop of the unstable
fall away.
THE CASH PERCENTAGE.
THE NEW BOARDER: “How many paying guests are there in this establishment ?"
THE CYNICAL DITTO: “Oh , 'bout half."
Speaking on the burden of Defence last
week, Dr. Maloney, M.H.R., said that, as
Australia could get 6000 aeroplanes for the
cost of a naval unit, it would be better to
spend the money on air-craft. But aero-
planes, under existing conditions, can’t carry
bombs of sufficient power to do an armored
ship any injury ; and against forts they are
no more than mosquitoes. That they are a
nuisance to an attacking force in land opera-
tions is quite true, but that is not so much
on account of the damage they inflict as
through the information they gather. They
make surprises practically impossible.
Neither in the Tripolitan nor the Balkan
campaigns did they inflict sixpenn’orth of
harm. The Italians employed a dirigible —
and it did nothing even against the Turks,
who had no means of retaliation. To over-
come a warship from above, an absolutely
new type of heavier-than-air flying ship is
required —one that can withstand quick-firing
artillery, and rain down 15-inch bombs. If
Maloney can evolve that sort of aeroplane,
he needn’t supply 6000 —60 will be about
enough to guard the coast of the whole con-
tinent. # t
The Maoriland waterfront strike stirred
up some Whitechapel language amongst a
crowd of immigrants last week in Sydney.
-They had been landed from the. Orient
1 steamer Orama expecting to tranship direct
to the Union Co.’s liner for M.L. But the
Union Co.’s ships were on the black list,
and unable to get crews; also, the co. de-
clined to feed and accommodate the immi-
grants prior to the departure of a ship.
Meanwhile, the Orient Co. had washed its
hands of the newcomers, and, as most of
their money had been drafted to M.L., the
position was desperate. Presently they
raised such a row that the Union Co. de-
cided to make a herculean attempt to get a
steamer away. The Maheno was selected
and portion of a crew scraped together.
Gaps were filled up by officers, about 25 of
whom held masters’ certificates. Still the
ship was undermanned. Then somebody had
a bright thought. Why not sign on the
immigrants? No sooner thought of than
done, and sufficient volunteered as seamen,
firemen, cooks, stewards and stewardesses to
make up a crew passable in quantity though
dubious in quality. In fact, it was about
the queerest crew that has taken a modern
steamer out of Port Jackson.
“Machete”: The usual gentle hint comes
from “influential quarters” that a, man will
be imported to fill a good Australian billet.
This time it is the job of that capable sapper,
Kirkpatrick, who goes from the Inspector-
Generalship of Australian Forces to an even
bigger task in India. If we are to have
imported goods I plump for lan Hamilton,
now on his way to Australia on official busi-
ness. Hamilton at present holds a nonde-
script position with the title of Inspector-
General of the Overseas Forces, or something
of the sort. This was an opening created to
get rid of the unmannerly Kitchener, whose
outspoken advocacy of compulsory service
did not commend itself to a Liberal Cabinet.
Kitchener, however, was even ruder than
usual when offered the sinecure, so
Hamilton, who had also incurred dis-
pleasure by his views on the Terri-
torial scheme, was put into the pigeon-
hole. The Australian job would delight him,
and a better choice could hardly be made.
Sound man as he is, Kirkpatrick has had
little experience of leading troops in the
field, though this alleged fault, often
brought against sappers, should hardly be
urged against a branch of the army which
has produced such men as Lee and Stonewall
Jackson. Hamilton, on the other hand, has
seen a tremendous lot of service, dating from
the unpleasantness which ended with the
capture of Majuba, in spite of Jim Page’s
heroic endeavors to save the situation at
Ingogo, shortly before. Much frontier fight-
ing in India followed, and there a cut from
a Malwa knife left Hamilton with a shrivelled
left hand. His second campaign in
South Africa was a brilliant success, and he
later paid a glowing tribute to Australian
troops before the War Commission. There
are few more dramatic pictures in modern
warfare than that of Hamilton and Danie
Opperman swapping revolver shots across
the gun-pit on Naval Hill, when the Boers
made their last desperate assault on Lady-
smith. at the end of a furious day’s fighting.
Opperman was killed later in an attack on
the sth Queenslanders at Onverwacht; his
opponent in the duel lives —perhaps to com-
mand the first Australian Army to take the
field. Who knows?
HOOKS AND EYES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am trying to write a verselet light.
And the subject 1 cannot hit;
But a voice and a step at my door 1 hear,
And I reckon that that is it.
Did I say it’s it? It is she, I mean ;
It is she that I love, no less,
With the three bright hooks that she cannot
reach,
In the 1 ack of her dainty dress.
There are three little hooks that she cannot
hitch
Jo their three little roguish eyes,
And a dear little gap in the dainty blouse
Where the cream of her sweetness lies.
Oh the rosy cream of her shoulders soft,
Just over a fragrant frill,
Would turn the head of an anchorite
Or the blood of a book-worm thrill!
Do I hook those hooks to their anxious eyes?
Do I hasten to hide from view
That kissable bit of her lovely back ?
Now, seriously, would you?

Sydney’s new Collector of Customs is
William Henry Barkley, who comes from
Brisbane to rule over the Custom House
where 13 years ago he was a clerk. Ilis
career has been meteoric. In 1903 he was
picked out to strengthen the Head Office
staff in Melbourne at £3lO a year. Various
promotions and a trip to London followed,
and in 1912 he was. paid £520. In 1913 he
went to Brisbane as Collector at £7OO, and
now he is at Sydney at £B5O.
The day before he walked over for Tenter-
field (N.S.W.), C. A. Lee passed his 73rd
milestone.
Maoriland has lost a noted painter in
Petrus Van Der Velden, who died at Auck-
land the other day, aged 79. He was a
Dutch artist, but had lived so many years
in M.L. that it had adopted him. Before
leaving Holland, he had made the fishers in
Zuyder Zee his specialty; and his art was
widely known when, at 56 years of age, he
sailed for Maoriland. Specimens of his
work are in the public galleries at Sydney,
Melbourne, Auckland, Wellington, Christ-
church and Dunedin.
Concerning the founder of Minchinbury,
the biggest vineyard near Sydney:—
Apropos Lieutenant Wm. Minehin, of the 102nd
Regiment (B. 20/11/T3). His daughter married
Henry Howey, who
at the first land
sale in Melbourne
on June 1, 1837,
nurchased three
half-acres on the
corner of Swanston-
street and Co’l ins-
street, known years
later as “Nichol-
son’s” and “Pupny
Dog Corner”—the
latter from the
men - poodles who
met there to ogle
the ladies on the
Block. Howey, after
making these and
other purchases,
came to Sydney to
take his family to
Port Phillip, but
the vessel was not
heard of after leav-
ing Port Jackson.
Howey’s descend-
ants have drawn
immense sums an-
nually from ground
rents of their Mel-
bourne land. Maior
Howey (a grand-
son) and his son
recently visited
Melbourne and dis-
posed on terms of
some of the pro-
perty ; the land
and absentee taxes
had rattled them.
Henry Howey and
his wife, Minchin’s
daughter, lived at
Minchinbury after
the death of the
original grantee.

Mayor Lavington Bonython, of Adelaide,
is to be given the pleasure of seeing a full-
sized oil-painting of himself placed in the
Town Hall. The only other Mayors so
privileged are brewer Smith and banker
Cohen, both of whom reigned for six years,
whereas Bonython, the youngest in the long
line of Mayors, has served for only two.
Fred Stock, dead in
at 65, was one of that city’s
best-known lawyers, and At-
torney-General for a few
months in a Holder Ministry
20 years ago. Particularly
young-looking till over 40, he
then went on an ill-advised
camel expedition to look for a
gold mine beyond Oodnadatta,
and only just got back alive.
After that his hair went white,
and he looked like the Silver
King in the fourth act. He had
a big commercial business and
many warm friends; but his
somewhat bitter brand of wit
brought him warm enemies too.
As Kingston once remarked
after a lively give-and-take pas-
sage in the S.A. Assembly,
“You can do anything with
Stock except ignore him.”
(’harles Edward Frazer died of success.
But he crammed more into his 33 years
than others even dream of. At 23 this ex-
newsboy was a member of the House of
Reps. At 30 he was Postmaster-General,
wielding enormous power, having control of
one of the greatest spending departments,
employing 16,000 persons. His outlook on
life was rosy. His mining speculations
turned up trumps. His land investments
were profitable beyond anticipations. Even
the turf paid its quota. It was after a re-
puted win of something like £3OOO on a
horse that he opened his mind to the writer,
telling him that adversity steeled a man to
greater deeds; but that success sapped his
vitality. Success was even then Frazer’s
bugbear. If he had lost everything he
would have been alive to-day. Even a writ
might have saved him. It would certainly
have brought the grit to the surface again.
And it came ; but it came too late.
Ex-Mayor Sam Gillott’s fortune of
£300,000 will go to Melbourne charities on
the death of his widow.
Died in Adelaide (1) W. J. Blacker, 70,
country auctioneer with a big voice and a
bluff manner, and “old Bill” to all his friends
in the South Aus. Assembly, in which he had
been member for Alexandra since 1892; (2)
Alexander Smoker, who was with Charles
Todd in the big work of running the tele-
graph line right across Australia, and so
linking up with Europe; (3) A. H. Bryson,
Indian surveyor and Australian fruit-grower,
who, as a boy of eight, went through the
siege of Lucknow, his father being killed
there; (4) A. D. Johnston, 49, one of thf
Oakbank brewing family, and a president of
the Onkaparinga Racing Club.
Died last week Colonel Le Alesurier, the
military commandant of South Aus. A
member of the Military Board before he went
to S.A., the late Le Mesurier, a native of
W.A., was a sort of link between the im-
ported and the local militoeracy. He was
a dandy officah, with a monocle and a haw
and a true British reverence for rules and
regulations. All the same, he was a most
amiable fellow, who carried his years lightly
and made himself liked as well as respected.
As commandant in S.A., he was a great suc-
cess. Le Mesurier had command of the
N.S.W. Imperial Bushmen in S’Africa at
Boer War time, and if his own country had
ever called upon the dapper little gentleman
to fight for it, he would have been fully
equal to the emergency.
The new Governor of Victoria, Arthur
Lyulph Stanley, is said to be a son of Lord
Sheffield —which he is, in a manner of
speaking, and, again, is not. Until 1909 he
was the son of Lord Stanley of Alderney, a
name historic in British politics, and he
is heir to that Barony. In 1909 his father
came into the Irish earldom of Sheffield
(family name Holroyd) ; but the British
Barony of Sheffield died with the earl who
went out in 1909. The wife of the first
Lord Stanley of Alderney was a daughter
of a Lord Sheffield; hence the connection.
The new Governor married Margaret Evans,
daughter of H. Evans Gordon, and has a son
and two daughters. He is 38, and his
father is 74.
The Commonwealth Government sports a
meteorological station on lone, frozen Mac-
quarie Island, whence blizzards are reported
daily by meteorologist Hunt’s officer, who,
with an operator mate, cook, and penguins,
constitutes the population of the rock. Time
being up for relieving the marooned weather
prophet down south, assistant Long, of the
Adelaide weather office, was on his way to
join Mawson’s Aurora at Hobart, en route
to Macquarie; but serious illness stopped
him at Melbourne, giving H. A. Hunt just
half a day to find a qualified Australian
prepared to leave next morning for a year’s
hardship among the ice. It seemed a tough
proposition; but 20-year-old assistant
Power of the Central office, just said “Yes”
or “Yep” to the question “Will you go?”
dashed home to pack his bag, and caught the
boat next morning.
“0.1 v.” writes of another tragedy of
success:—
Why this conspiracy of misrepresentation re the
passing out of Charley Frazer, ex-P.M.G., when his
case might be so aptly used as a warning to young
men? The plain, ghastly truth which ought to be
told is that Frazer died of pneumonia because he
had exposed himself to the risk of untimely decease
by his devotion to whisky. He earned political suc-
cess by strenuous endeavor in the best possible
direction ; but his success was his undoing. Having
raised himself to a place where he could drink with
seeming impunity, the temptation to do it was too
strong foi* him, and before he had thoroughly real-
ised his weakness he unluckily took the fatal chill—-
at the age of 33. Even before he fell sick of
pneumonia he had brought himself “up against it” ;
it was an open secret that in the event of the s Labor
party’s return to power he would be omitted from
the Ministry. Yet, had he taken the warnings, he
might have come again ; for there were the makings
of a new man in him, and as a reformed character
he would have gone far. Fate was, however, unkind,
and refused him the second chance.
The latest addition to Melb. City Council
is Charlie Atkins, who differs from most of
the begowned brethren in being addicted to
work. Atkins does things. He started the
Australian Exhibition of local manufactures,
and originated the idea of a concerted shop-
window display of home-made goods, which
idea has since been adopted in Britain. He
is even daring to talk of greater activity in
dealing with the Melbourne dust evil; so
unless the other councillors sit upon him in
one great fat body, Atkins will doubtless
bring more water-waggons and things into
action. Some years ago he had a craze for
forming patriotic societies, which came to
nothing; but his latest outbreak of that sort
should certainly arrive at a head. He is
promoting an Ancient Mariners’ Society for
the joint purpose of bringing the old salts
together in convivial fellowship and diffus-
ing nautical spirit amongst the rising gene-
ration. Charlie Atkins, like his brother
councillor Davies (of Gordon and Gotch),
was an able-bodied seaman in his early days.
After he had left the bounding, briny, greasy
ocean and started in business for himself, the
pushful young man worked his passage to
England as quarter-master on a mail
steamer. The question now is. Will his energy
survive his election to the City Council?
Harry Holland, editor of MaorilanH
Worker, is at present between four walk
on a charge of sedition and inciting person!
to resist the police when the waterside strike
was at its height in Wellington. This k
the second time he has run up against a
charge of sedition. On the first occasion
the scene of the explosion was at Broken
Hill, and Henry was blown into prison for
two years as the outcome. A most earnest
man is Holland, with all the foraivahk,
faults of the visionary. arable

“Parrakeelyah”: Sam McCaugliey’s letter
of sympathy with Ulster, published at his
native Ballymena, seems to have been a
muddled epistle altogether. According to the
copy supplied to the Ballymena sheet, Sam
says he left Ireland 37 years ago, whereas
56 years ago he was already well planted in
Victoria.
History and the pawnshop again. A
brief cablegram flickered in from Berlin the
other morning to the effect that a collection
of Byzantine jewels and gems which be-
longed to the Princess Gisela, consort of
the Emperor Conrad 11., who reigned in
1030 or thereabouts, had been found in the
ruins of the Jewish quarter at Mayence.
Now the pawn ticket has been lost, and the
Jew is scattered to the winds, and Gisela
herself is as dusty as the ruined loan office.
Remain only the jewels and the query:
“What did she raise the money for?” Con-
rad 11. was a successful practitioner in his
own line, and her uncle, Rudolf 111., King
of Burgundy, or Arles, bequeathed his king-
dom to him ; so the family ended up in a
prosperous way. Perhaps the things were
popped to buy Conrad a new sword. He
did a fair amount of fighting in his time
and must have ruined a lot of cutlery.
A. A. Jones, labor candidate for Dulwich
Hill (N.S.W.), was the originator of the
present N.S.W. Clerks’'Union, which was
formed back in 1907. Jones was employed
in a city house where, to make up for under-
staffing, the clerks were expected to work
back about five nights per week for tea
money. With the assurance of his brother
penpushers that they were at the back of
him, Jones used his tea-money one night to
pay for an advertisement convening a meet-
ing to form a Clerks’ Union. The support
of his brethren in that office did not materi-
alise, but the Union got on its legs
after a struggle, and for a while, at all
events, was an important factor in public
affairs.
News is to hand of the death of Captain
Whitton, the first Australian to become
distinguished in the American Service. A
native of Melbourne, educated at St. Peter’s
College, Adelaide, he early went to sea, and
obtained a master’s certificate when only
22. He had expert knowledge of thousands
of miles of coastline in China, Korea,
Japan, Borneo and the Philippines, and had
the luck to be in Manila when the Spanish-
Ainerican war broke out. Admiral Dewey
took him into the American service, and
made him captain of a desnatch boat in
attendance on the flagship Olympia. Be
accompanied Dewey all through the war,
and afterwards did imnortant work on the
Chinese coasts, in Korea and Japan.
Ordered to San Francisco, he took his ves-
sel round Magellan to join the Atlantic
Fleet, and put in some work at Norfolk,
the U.S. Naval Dep6t, in Virginia, where
he died.
POLONA, THE SAUSAGE QUEEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(A mad song of counter-lunch turned down in the
Australian Anthem Competition.)
There’s a girl ’way down in Swanston-street
That runs through Melbourne town;
All day she drew, for the elite,
The beer that’s red or brown ;
At noon they stormed the counter-lunch,
But, when the shadows fell,
The hungry drinkers, bunch by bunch,
They gave the sausage !
They skinned and ate the sausage wild,
What time my dear Polona smiled.
Polona!
I’d like to own her ;
But, ’spite the love that I have shown that no one
else has shown her,
She’s married to another, though I’d dearly love to
bone her.
Polona,
The Sausage Queen !
At five o’clock the sausage comes
Unto his well-earned rest;
The drinkers bring their little “thrums”
And eat the very best;
Frankfurts and cheese by pounds they gnaw
And clear the counter soon ;
Sausage they eat until the dark,
And sausage ’neath the moon.
Sausage, alas! to me is dead,
Alas, for dear Polona’s wed!
Polona !
I’ve cause to moan her,
Though she may make long penances, I never can
condone her ;
And, though she’s me deserted, I can never leave
alone her.
Polona!
The Sausage Queen !
She’s left the bar in Swanston-street,
That runs through Melbourne town;
She’s married to the sausage suite —
He wheels it up and down ;
He sells the Frankfurt and the spud
From ten p.m. till morn ;
But for the law I’d have his blood,
And so —I laugh in scorn !
My laughter burns him like benzine,
That Sausage King who took my queen.
Polona !
I think I’ll ’phone her,
And tell her that ambition dies; but all the love
I’ve shown her
Shall bring her yet to bitter tears, and sadly she
will moan her.
Polona !
My Sausage Queen.
VICTORIA.
RANDOLPH.

This iu a few plain lines is how the
finances of N. S. Wales are moving:—
five months' transactions.
Revenue .. .. .. £6,787,250
Expenditure .. .. 7,593,099
Deficit £805,849
That is to say, the revenue did not meet the expendi-
ture by £805,849 in five months. On top of that
there is, of course, the loan expenditure:—
Loan expenditure. . . . £3,662,196
Deficit revenue account .. 805,849
Total amount by which the
State failed to live
within its income for
five months . . . . £4,468,045
Last year’s drift to the bad, exclusive of loan expendi-
ture, was £1,200,000. Whatever difference of opinion
there may be on the question of borrowing, there is
room for none whatever on this of drifting into debt
to pay policemen's wages, Ministers’ salaries, and the
like. Yet in one year and five months the State has
gone in this way £2,000,000 to the bad. This is
too serious a matter to play with. The man who
ran a private business on such lines would inevitably
go bankrupt; and, to speak in the plainest terms, he
would have a lot of luck if he didn’t also go to gaol.
He would certainly be refused a certificate on the
grounds of recklessness.

“Profits on repurchase of old deposits, £1315.” That
calls first for a few words of explanation. When
the big trouble came after the boom in borrowing, the
depositors couldn’t get their money back at once:
that would have meant selling securities at an awful
sacrifice. An arrangement, followed by a re-arrange-
ment, had therefore to be made with the depositors.
The debt was cut in halves; on one half the bank
finally agreed to pay 4 p.c. and on the other half 3
p.c. and a further l| p.c. out of profits. For the pro-
tection of depositors the bank must put £15,000 a
year to reserves, to be available for interest pay-
ments, and one-fourth of the profits after various
appropriations are made must go towards buying up
deferred deposits As these deposits are at a discount,
owing mainly to the dearness of money, the £14,385
of profit set aside in 1912 as per agreement bought
inscribed deposit stock of the face value of £15,700.
The difference represents “profits on repurchase of
old deposits”; and the £15,700 is used to write
down assets to correspond with the reduction of debt.
If the assets are worth 20s. in the £, the further
writing down amounts, of course, to the creation of
an inner reserve.
The position with regard to the debt to old deposi-
tors is as follows:
1896. 1910. 1912. 1913.

This money is really a permanent fixed deposit, with
the qualification mentioned above. While money is
scarce and rates for overdraft and other accommoda-
tion are high, it is, of course, a fine thing for the bank
to have it; and the rapid growth of the profits is no
doubt largely due to the fact that jthe bank has been
getting more and more for money for which it has
been paying no more itself. Nor is it likely that
money will be so cheap as to worry this bank for a
long time to come. Perhaps rates will be lower than
they have been lately, but the signs are that the
very cheap money of a few years back won’t repeat
itself. This suits the E. S. and A. down to the
ground.

Generally, the bank has strengthened its position ; it
has reduced its advances and materially increased its
holding of liquid assets. Certainly it owes a trifle
more to depositors, etc., than it did 12
months ago; but £1 of the new debt is
represented by considerably more than 20s. of
liquid assets. Without reckoning bills receivable
and remittances in transit as liquid, there is almost
enough to pay out all the current account depositors.
The position in that respect is distinctly good. And
in other_ respects it is improving. Profits (including
that derived from repurchase of old debt) were last
year £109,009. Of this all that was paid away was
£43,155; the balance goes to strengthen the bank.
Some of the strengthening is obligatory under the
agreement with the old depositors; but apart from
that the management is doing good work in the same
direction. It is unquestionably the right policy,
because, as suggested above, the debt in proportion
to capital is very large (the capital is £539,437 in
£l2 10s. shares), and a lot of the debt carries a
pretty high fixed rate of interest. In other words,
the capital and reserves have to protect a very large
amount of advances, etc.; hence the wisdom of big
reserves, otherwise the capital might be pinched in
time of stress.

That transfer of reserves to capital, equal to a bonus
of 3s. 4d. per share, makes the 150,000 shares fully
paid to 20s. The co.’s performance in the last three
years has been very remarkable. At the end of
September, 1911, the shares were 10s. paid. The other
10s. has been added by successive yearly instalments
of 3s. 4d.; and not only has that been done and the
10 p.c. dividend maintained, but large additions have
still been made to reserves. Put it in another way.
The paid capital three years ago was £75,000.
Since then, in three years, the profits have been
£138,241, which have been cut up as follows:
Transferred to capital .. .. £75,000
Added to reserves . . .. 33,241
Dividends to shareholders . . 30,000
Total £138,241
Thus rather less than 22 p.c. of the profits have.
been taken out of the business. The other 78 p.c.
has been left in for the further protection of policy-
holders. Meantime an internal reserve of £40,000
an unearned premium reserve—has been disclosed;
and there has been a certain amount written off
assets. These latter are, however, of so good a
character that heavy depreciations are not called for;
but the policy of the management is pretty well
shown by the fact that “office furniture at head-
office and branches” has been written down to
nothing. During the past year freehold offices have
been built and opened at Melbourne; and as furni-
ture stands at nil in the books, this means that the
cost of the furniture for the new office has been
charged against the past year’s revenue. Now a
start has been made with an officers’ provident fund,
and £2OOO, voted to that most desirable object, has
also been written off the year’s profits. It is a
story of extraordinary success, and shows what a
money-making business fire and marine insurance is
when once an office establishes itself, makes a good
name, and is blessed with capable management. In
this instance the management has been conspicuously
vigorous as well as otherwise capable, and it has
had the advantage of good backing. It grew out of
a small insurance department of Burns, Philp and
Co., and when it got a home of its own it still had
the push of that influential concern behind it.
Further, it declared itself an Australian office and,
other things being equal, it claimed the support of
Australia on that ground; and it had the good for-
tune to find an increasing number of Australians
ready to admit the claim. On good, solid grounds,
too. Big figures alone are of no value to a policy-
holder when he has had a loss. You can’t satisfy a
claim with a peck of figures. But the local insurer
can ascertain what the local office has behind its
figures. He can test its assets. He knows, gener-
ally speaking, what they are worth. And he knows
also the personnel of the office —can tell whether the
directors are men of good reputation, or financial
sharks who are prepared to fake their accounts in order
to get custom and adopt sharp practices to avoid
paying-out when the policy becomes a claim. He
can do none of these things where a foreign office is
concerned; he has to take everything on trust.
Appropriately, A. McVernon, an Australian trained
in the office, has succeeded the late E. J. Felton as
general manager after 18 months’ probation.
One way and another, then, this co. has sprung
ahead, and in seven years has more than doubled
its premium income:—

With business growing at that rate it is, of course,
very necessary that reserves, or capital and reserves,
should grow rapidly, too, so that policy-holders may
have the protection they are entitled to. The man-
agement has, therefore, done the only right thing in
keeping down the dividends, and that policy ought
still to be pursued. Capital and reserves combined
now total £331,959. Premiums (which are a rough
measure of risks) were last year £215,006. Thus
funds are 154 p.c. of the year’s premiums; and,
though that is not a low percentage—it is about
the same as the English average—it is less than that
of the strongest Australian cos. A few more years
of the present policy of small dividends will, how-
ever, put the co. in as strong a position in this re-
spect as it is in others. As mentioned before, the
assets are an exceptionally good lot: of the total
assets (£383,882), £110,639 was in freeholds (pre-
mises in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and elsewhere)
and everything else is in either deposits and cash
or public securities. Yet, notwithstanding that the
assets are gilt-edged, the interest earnings were more
than enough to pay the year’s dividend; in other
words, the entire underwriting profit and a little
besides was put by where it is available to meet the
claims of policy-holders.

That doesn’t look well; but it would be almost im-
possible for the figures of any insurance co. to look
well for the first two or three years. This, at any
rate, can be said: the co., though it got much more
business in the second year, didn’t go nearly as far
to leeway in getting it. Really, of course, though a
deficit of £20,488 is shown above, the co. is more
money out of pocket than that, because the income
isn’t profit—the co. has to supplv insurance for it.
The exact position can’t be ascertained till a valua-
tion has been made of the policy liabilities; in
other words, until we know what "the co. ought to
have saved up at the end of the second year towards
paying the policies as they fall due. For the
present all that can be said is that, if every policy-
holder forfeited his policy now, and no more claims
had to be paid, the co. would have £29,791 of its
total capital of £52,279 available to refund to
shareholders, assuming that its assets are worth 20s.
in the £. If it had to pay another co. to take
over its contracts there would be less. On the other
hand, the co. has (at great expense, no doubt) estab-
lished a certain connection and goodwill. No insur- !
ance co., as mentioned just now, shows up well for
the first few years. Even the A.M.P.’s industrial
department, notwithstanding the prestige of the office.
issued some rather terrible figures at the end even of
the third year. The experience of the M.L.C. (the
old Citizens’, with others grafted on) has also been
quoted for the encouragement of the Co-operative Co.’s
shareholders. The Bulletin doesn’t want to dis-
courage them; it merely remarks that when one
small boy has robbed the melon-patch, the second
small boy is liable to be disappointed when he at-
tempts to repeat the process. However, while this
co. hopes to get something from the old patch, and
might reasonably point out that there are melons
ripening all the time, it relies largely upon another
patch altogether. This is the house-purchase busi-
ness, which, when in good hands, has been worked
satisfactorily in England. Given good management
it ought to succeed here. The central idea is that
the policy-holder should assure to his family a roof
oyer the heads of the wife and children, whether he
dies soon or late; and it is a good idea entirely.
Naturally, going in for this branch, the co. has most
of its funds in mortgages; apart from that
(£21,887) its assets are nearly all cash.

But in a case of this kind reserves are a matter
only of very rough estimation. Theoretically, re-
serves are the value of the assets in excess of the
capital. Now, the bulk of the capital here is repre-
sented by timber lands and plant; and you can't
arrive at the value of a forest of timber like you can
at that of a handful of sovereigns. In 1908, for in-
stance, when the rule was run. over the co.’s pro-
perties, the management believed that they had been
undervalued to the extent of no less than £277,458
—that is to say, approximately half the total of the
capital. Assets were, therefore, written up to that
extent. Since then large holes have no doubt been
made in the forests; but it is impossible to say
whether corresponding holes have been made in the
book values of the assets. The freehold and lease-
hold timber lands are valued now “on the basis of
the valuation of August 31, 1908 (excepting assets
acquired since that date, which are taken at cost),
less depreciations written off.” Since .1908 timber
has risen very much in price; figures are being got
now which were undreamt of a few years ago. The
chances are, therefore, that the standing and grow-
ing timber asset is undervalued at present, assuming,
of course, that fair amounts have been deducted from
the original valuation as a set-off against the timber
removed since 1908.
The cq.’s financial position has undergone consider-
able change during the past 12 months. Here are
some more figures:—-
1901. 1911. 1912. 1913.
Liabilities in-
cluding de-
bentures .. £327,610 £60,701 £60,553 £128,958
Liquid assets 148,342 225,086 278,717 230,161
Deficit ..£179,268
Surplus .. £164,385 £218,164 £101,203
Liquid assets include consignments, loans, shares in
other cos. and book debts. In the past 12 months
the surplus of all these assets over liabilities has
been cut into to the extent of £116,961. This and other
money has gone into leaseholds ( £41,638), plant and
machinery (£25,362), and stock-in-trade (£75,750).
‘The stock-in-trade, with that big addition for the
year, now amounts to £265,256.
As to the future, only a guess can be made. The
kauri forests are disappearing; some Maoriland
officials have said they won’t last more than another 14
years; others put the life at over 30 years. The
weight of evidence seems to be in favor of the longer
period. Whether this co. will see all the others out
is, of course, another matter; but on all the infor-
mation available it has still a good many years
ahead of it. At present, its liquid surplus (including
interests in other cos.) is £101,203 —which isn’t
much towards returning the capital of £585,000.
But besides liquid assets there is the very big stock
and the land, a good deal of it freehold ; and the
land isn’t given away with a pound of soap when the
timber is cleared. Also, the tremendous change made
between 1901 and 1911—an excess of liabilities
( £179,268) being changed into a surplus of liquid
assets ( £164,385) —shows how rapidly the assets can
be turned into money even in a decade when circum-
stances weren’t uniformly favorable. Finally, there
is the fact that the supply of the world’s kauri is
very limited, and, though the demand may ease off
when the present boom in construction passes, the
price isn’t likely to shrivel much. The tendency
will, no doubt, be the other way.

This co. is cleaning up an old mess; and the size
of the lose shown in previous years has been mostly
governed by the quantity of property got rid of
during the period. The past year shows a profit,
mainly because (1) rents have been higher and in-
terest earnings on loans greater, and (2) the heavy
outlay of some years past on sewerage connections
has apparently come to an end. Having perhaps an
idea that things will be generally better in future,
a re-arrangement has been made with the old credit-
ors. This is reported in these terms: “The society
to pay the depositors the first of the substituted
deposits receipts when same shall become due, and
pay the remainder of the substituted deposit receipts
by 10 yearly payments.” From all accounts, this
means an early payment of something like ss. in the
£. It also seems that, instead of the old 21 p.c.
interest, 3£ p.c. is to be paid on the balance out-
standing. The position with regard to assets and
liabilities is as follows:
„ 1898. 1911. 1912. 1913.
Fixed deposits £251,155 £154,295 £143,609 £l3l 911
Mortgages .. 79,771 5,827 1,578 2,044

Other assets .. 1,129 101 106 4 155
Total assets .. 579,636 359,902 341,724 332’093
Thus since 1898 £247,543 of assets have paid off
£200,781 of debt; and there is £138,424 of debt
still to pay off, and £332,093 of assets to do it win,
Assuming that the remaining assets realise on n
average, as well as the ones that have been got
of, the £332,093 will bring in about £270 00(1
In this calculation the increased rate of iot’p",;
payable on the old deposits has been disregarded | „
it will probably be counterbalanced by the increase,!
earnings. If matters work out according to the rnU
of three, there should thus be about £133,000 over
and above the money which the society owes
Whether things will work out according to rule of
three, this paper doesn’t know. There are 46 90s
shares paid up to £5 = £231,490. But in
case, don’t divide the £133,000 by 46,298’ and snv
that the shares should be worth £3 or so apiece"
because in the first place they are not paying anv
dividend, and in the second place it is quite uncer
tain when the assets will be realised and distributed

That last line looks worse perhaps than it ought to
The fact is, pretty large drafts have been made on a
contingency reserve, no doubt on account of losses
made on the realisation of securities; and in the fore
going these losses have been charged against the
year’s revenue. The position is explained by this
table:—

On current business, therefore, the past year showed
up very well. The losses on sales may have re-
sulted from advances made years ago, and the
securities may have been nursed till now. Thus a
prosperous year, when prices are fair and the pro-
perty market brisk, may show more money written
off than a dull year when no properties are got rid
of. The steady increase in the amount written off
the contingency fund—that is to say, the growing loss
on properties—certainly doesn’t look cheerful; but
for the above-mentioned reasons it may not be as bad
as it looks. If it is as bad as it looks, the 64 p.c.
dividend should not be repeated until the position
improves a lot.

Against that debt there is, besides office and other
properties, advances on mortgage of £145,452. Thus
the mortgages represent more than double the de-
posits and other debts not covered by cash. Even
allowing that property values in a town more or less
dependent on mining have a bad habit of shrinking,
the depositors’ position is far removed from anxietv.
And the shareholders’ capital ( £65,136) is pretty
well secured, too, for, as shown above, there are
£22,585 of reserves; and £22,585 will cover a lot
of shrinkage in advances and other such assets
scheduled in the books at £161,919 in all.

You can get a better idea of the progress the com-
pany is making from this table:—

The liabilities include a mortgage of £BOOO, and
the co. is making fairly energetic efforts to remove
the plaster, which has about four years to stick. At
the present rate of progress it will have to do some
renewing. But after the whole thing has gone, the
co. will still have the job of making provision for the
depreciation of its buildings, which still stand in
the books at cost. True, repairs, etc., are charged
to profit and loss, but you can’t go on patching the
same old building ad infinitum. Receipts from rooms
and beds let (the co. runs a lodging-house) show a
healthy increase of from £5540 to £5696 for the
year; so, all round, shareholders have nothing to be
alarmed at.

Go back 10 years and you’ll find that the reserves
then were rather more than they are now; which
means that, assuming enough and only just enough pro-
fit has been written off to cover wear and tear of plant,
etc., the co. has not quite earned the dividends it
has paid in the 10 years. That is the result on a
10 years’ survey ; and during that period the divi-
dend has got down as low as 2£ p.c. On a survey
of the past five years the results appear much more
attractive. During that time the profits, besides
paying better dividends, have allowed of large
sums being written off against depreciation, for
which apparently it was wasn’t possible to
make proper provision in the previous few years.
The day will come, no doubt, when the neglected
wear and tear will all be provided for; and then
it will be possible, if business keeps up where it
has been lately, to add something substantial to the
reserves. It might even be possible to give the
shareholders a trifle more in the way of dividends.
On past records the management can be trusted not
to do anything rash in the latter respect. Th e

Water-Supply engineers will be interested to learn
that further evidence proving the durability of W. I.
and Steel Pipes when coated by the Asphaltum pro-
cess, has just been obtained by the engineers of the
Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. Certain
alterations were made to the main which supplies the
City of South Melbourne with water, and consequently
some pipes were taken up. These pipes were made in the
year 1889, and were coated with Asphaltum composi-
tion in the usual way, and they were laid in ground
that was particularly unfavorable to the preservation
of any unprotected metal, being originally swampy
land, containing much vegetable matter, and filled
with tidal dredgings. On examination, these 24-year-
old pipes were found to be in an excellent state of
preservation, and the Board’s engineers were so satis-
fied with their condition that they decided to use
them again. They were, therefore, removed to the
works of Messrs. Mephan Ferguson Proprietary Lim-
ited, at Footscray, Victoria, where these 24-year-old
pipes were cleaned, retested, and recoated with
Asphaltum composition in a new and improved pro-
cess. They are now being relaid in a position where
they will have to withstand a working pressure of
1351 b. to the square inch. That the Asphaltum pro-
cess for coating pipes is rust-proof and thoroughly
efficacious is proved by the foregoing.*

finances have been handled very prudently for as far
back as The Bulletin’s history of the co. extends.
Most manufacturing cos. in Australia and Maoriland
have found foreign competition so keen that, in order
to pay any sort of a dividend at all, they have
starved their plant, or gone into debt to provide
renewals. This co. hasn’t been guilty of that ; when
times have been poor the dividend has been poor,
and when times have been good the dividend has
been kept strictly moderate, and the surplus has
been put into new plant. The result is that the
co. is in the happy position of having practically no
debt. And it is in the equally happy position of hav-
ing established a fine name for its products on both
sides of the Tasman Sea.
Apropos the increased div. on Tooth’s pref.
shares, there is not, of course, and never has been, any
doubt about the power of the directors to pay more
than 6 p.c. The resolution which governs the
matter, passed on March 3 of this year, runs as
follows: “Whenever in the opinion of the directors
the profits of the company in respect of any year
shall be more than sufficient to pay the fixed prefer-
ential dividend aforesaid to the close of such year
and also a dividend for such year at the rate of
£lO per centum per annum on the ordinary shares
the directors may increase the dividend on the prefer-
ence and/or ordinary shares to such a rate as they
may determine.”
Some idea of the economy that may come
from scrapping an out-of-date plant and installing a
modern one may be got from the experience of the
Broken Hill Block 10. There the new concentrating
plant designed by Weir is estimated to be making
e 37,250 a year more than the old plant could do,
allowing for differences in grade of ore. As the cost
of the new plant was about £43,000, it pays for
itself in 15 months.
Understood that Broken Hill Junction
North last week learned the worst in connection with
its ill-advised litigation. What its own costs are
have not transpired, but it will pay the B. H. Junc-
tion, in costs and damages, £9OOO. Probably its
own lot will be about £7OOO. So far, the co.
has set aside about £ll,OOO of profit towards the
unfortunate business. From the last half-yearly
report, published the other day, it seemed as if that
ended the matter; but it now looks as if another
£5OOO or so will have to be taken from this
current half-year’s profits.
As indicated some time ago, the Zinc
Corporation has been sadly disappointed at Sunny
Corner (N.S.W.), and has now definitely turned down
the option it held over the old mine.
H. E. Pratten, who has made money out
of Malayan tin and looks like making a lot more,
is putting some of it into N. S. Wales mining. He
and a few friends some months ago took over half
a dozen claims on the old Hargraves goldfield, and
formed the Hargraves Consolidated G. M. Co. Now,
with assistance from the prospecting vote, they are
testing what geologists are agreed are saddle reefs
of the Bendigo type. If they don’t succeed it will
not be for lack of encouragement. Present Under-
Sec. of Mines Pittman, in his “Mineral Resources of
N. S. Wales,” wrote 13 years ago that “it is im-
probable that similar deposits would be allowed to
remain unprospected in depth in any other English-
speaking country.” Some work has, certainly, been
done, an English co., among others, having had a
go at it; but the work in nearly every case was
bad. This English concern, the Hargraves Gold-
fields, Ltd., put down a shaft, but did it so far
from “centre country” that it was practically use-
less for prospecting purposes. The present co., how-
ever, has made use of it for continuing old cross-
cuts and driving new ones; and enough stone, the
management believes, has already been exposed to
justify a small battery. A purchase has accordingly
been made. Water is pretty heavy; hence a good
pump has also been put in. The reefs are so far
erratic in size and value, but naturally the co.
doesn’t think it has yet got the best there is in the
mine. Of one thing one can be certain; the pro-
perty will be tested in a businesslike way. Pratten's
big say in the co. guarantees that much.
Hargraves is about 20 miles from Hill End,
and on the same belt of rocks. It was
one of the first goldfields discovered in N. S. Wales ;
it was there in 1851 that Black Brother found
“Kerr’s Hundredweight,” an almost solid mass of
gold in a quartz outcrop. How much was won
from the field in the first five or six years nobody
knows, but from 1858 to 1874 the records show
that 205,5850 z. were sent away. Then, when the
rich stuff was finished, the comparatively poor stuff
was despised; but with more information about
saddle-reefs and with better appliances, the present
co. is probably justified in believing that it has quite
as good chances as most of the people who were on
the field in the ’6o’s and ’7o’s.
Broken Hill has been having one of its
frequent troubles with its water supply. The co.’s
concession has only five years or so to run, and
naturally it isn’t putting more money than it can
help into renewals and replacements; naturally also,
as its life was limited to 28 years, it didn’t deliber-
' ately put in works in the beginning that would last
100 years when it could get cheaper ones that would
do well enough for 30. So break-downs are numerous
nowadays, and mines and town have both been on
short commons. This sort of thing will give the
Government scheme a fillip when water is available
from Umberumberka; and that won’t tend to improve
the profits of B. 11. Water Supply, Ltd., in its last
days.

for the Broken Hill Water Supply, Ltd.—for 20

cern with great ability—retires about the end of

“Disheartened”: One would think lodide
(Mineral Hill) was in the centre of Australia. For
months the reports have been that shaft-sinking has
been hindered by deficient pumping capacity, or
breakages, or some other old thing ad nauseam. All
bunkum in the case of a mine situated a few miles
from the Condobolin railway station. The mine
itself has shown promise, but is being ruined by the
dilatory methods of the so-called management, one
eyes are being picked and sacrificed, instead of the
main shaft being sunk at express speed to prove the
lode at depth. It is time the contribs. shook things
up, and insisted on a decent run for their money ; the
management being mostly in the hands of pro-
moters, who probably stand on velvet, does not seem
to worry.
“Rope Boy”: The committee appointed
by Edden, N.S.W. Minister for Mines, to inquire into
the dust trouble in collieries has commenced work,
after listening to a strong protect made by the
miners’ unions against its personnel. The objection
to certain members of the committee is on the
ground that they are interested in collieries which
for years have been regarded as dangerous on account
of dust in the- workings. The men haven’t had a
fair deal in this matter. It is well known that in a
large mine on the South Coast the miners have for
years been agitating for an improvement. On one
occasion the only satisfaction they got, in reply to
a request to the manager to reduce the peril, was an
intimation, in writing, that if the conditions did
not suit any of the employees, there was nothing to
stop them seeking work elsewhere. Poor consolation
for men who had in some cases bought land aj
erected cottages! There was, of course, nothing tor
them but to bear it —and feel sore. The men argue
that the Minister already has power to compel cos. to
make great improvements in the conditions under-
ground. Edden being a practical miner, they ex-
pected much from him : but after three years experi-
ence of him they find that he is apparently strangled
by red-tape or bluffed out of action. Whether the
committee's investigations will improve matters re-
mains to be seen. Meantime, another Bulh or Moun
Kembla catastrophe is quite possible. When it happen
perhaps someone will get a move on.
Adelaide shareholders in Baker’s Creek
(N.S.W.) are disappointed at the clean-up of 409
tons for 5350 z. Returns like that at rather long
intervals may mean another call.
Mount Elliott people in London pack a
lot of information into the precis of the annual
report cabled out for the benefit of Australian share-
holders. After, writing off £10,644 for plant depre-
ciation and charging up to working exes, all mine
development except the sinking of the Consols main
shaft, the year gave a profit of £141,811. The
smelter ran 7ft months and chewed up 41,633 tons ore
for 4631 tons copper, 72850 z. silver and 87570 z.
gold. That was an extraction of 11.1 p.c. copper
and 4.2dwt. gold. But what has come out doesn’t
matter much by comparison with what is left in:
and that is Elliott’s weak point. Down to 400 ft. in
the Elliott there are (or were —the date of Corbould’s
estimate isn’t given) 35,000 tons of 10 to 12 p.c.
ore; in the Consols down to 250 ft., 8000 tons; and
in the Selwyn to the 120 ft., 1500 tons —same grade.
That is, say, only eight months’ supply at the same
rate of going. Given the same extraction and markets
(which is putting too good a face on things, because
the copper market has weakened), there would be
just about £150,000 profit in that lot. Then there
is the “probable” ore, 37,000 tons high-grade; and
350,000 tons of 3 p.c. sulphides, which might be
worth a good deal of money if they were in a mine
that had another million tons of them.
Hampden-Cloncurry’s half-yearly report
testifies to a profit of £66,398, less depreciation
£7817. It also claims a surplus of liquid assets
amounting to £48,447. On the strength of this
the co. has declared a dividend of £35,000. This
leaves an apparent surplus of £13,447, not taking
into consideration any profits that may be made to
the date of payment of dividend. It is not much, and
won’t go far with the heavy capital expenditure this
co. is incurring. Capital charges for the half-year
amounted to £102,475, including £54,375, balance
of Macgregor purchase. In reality the craft is nearer
a ducking than the above indicates, for the debenture
debt has yet to be reckoned with. This amounts to
£60,000, of which the trifle of £20,000 must be
paid in 12 months’time, and £40,000 by the year 1916.
So instead of a surplus there really was a deficit of
£11,553 even before the div. was provided for.
If the next half-year be as good as the last, and if
the same rate of dividend be maintained, the co. will
earn £58,000 and distribute £70,000. Divs. are
now paid quarterly. If the next half-year’s share of
the debenture redemption be added, the co. must pay
away (or make provision for) £22,000 above its
earnings, plus the amount of capital expenditure in-
curred during that time. It isn’t cheerful, and, worse
still, the process must continue until the debenture
debt has gone, and until capital charges cease. By
that time the Hampden and Duchess mines won’t be
as vigorous as they are at present. The other alterna-
tive is to reduce the dividend before disaster hap-
pens.
Hampden ore reserves are estimated at 255,000
tons, containing 25,640 tons of copper. An elo-
quent silence is preserved about the details. Earlier
estimates included nearly 60,000 tons of Duchess ore,
averaging about 5 p.c. copper, and this lot can be
wiped out straight away. At any rate, for the
present. The furnaces chewed up 8783 tons of
Hampden ore, 12,129 tons from the Duchess and 3832
tons from elsewhere. Total, 24,744 tons of ore.
This required about 4000 tons of barren flux. Just
here there is a severe dispute with previous practice,
for much the same tonnage of ore last half-year
required more than double the amount of flux. More
basic ore was evidently treated than formerly, though
the growing scarcity of basic ore is a serious problem
already. The estimate of reserves could be quite
interesting on this point, if it cared to be. But
it doesn’t. Anyway, each ton of conper produced cost
£49 55., from ore of an extractable value of 10}
p.c. copper. It is true that the reserves won’t
stretch to that grade, while the lack of basic ore
will make for still higher costs in the future. But
allow a steady cost of £5O per ton of copper, and
throw in, say, £2 10s. for the contained gold and
silver. With electrolytic copper at an average price
of £65 the copper in the reserves would be worth
£450,000, or a shade over 255. per share. After
that there are the Macgregor reserves to make up
the difference in the market price. Accidents might
easily make that difference greater by reducing the
value of the reserves.
Mills United, Charters Towers, has de-
clared a shilling dividend ( £15,000). The aggre-
gate return for 10 months was only £20,299 from
8636 tons; so, with expensive development work to
pay for, the dividend will dig into the accumu-
lated cash. Freehold, with 150,000 shares, and Mills,
with 300,000, require large ore reserves to make
them comfortable.
* * * *
Mount Morgan Extended (Q.) is still peg-
ging away and drawing on its big reserve of faith.
The total depth reached is 1620 ft., but at present,
driving is going on at the 750 level, which is con-
siderably lower than Mount Morgan’s lowest (the
Extended’s surface level is 4 00ft. below that of the
big co.). A zone has just been passed showing
1 p.c. copper and a few grains of gold, and
now hard quartzite is being cut through. Mills,
of Charters Towers, who is financing the concern,
has just looked over the work and pluckily intends
to keep on for some years yet. Mount Morgan has
been given an invitation to come in, but at present
it has quite enough troubles of its own.
Westralia Mount Morgans (W.A.) has
been raised from the dead, and is now treating ore
again. The management reckons that there is at
least two years’ stone in sight, and that plenty more
can be blocked out by the time this reserve is chewed
up by the mill. Nothing is being done at present
below 300 ft. on account of the water-logged con-
dition of the workings, but later on this part of the
mine will receive attention. In its palmy days the
show produced over a million sterling and paid
nearly a quarter of a million in dividends. The
300,000-odd shares were put up to £9, and all was
merry and bright. Then everything seemed to go to
pot, and the co. died in debt. A. E. Morgans, the
original promoter, stuck to the mine right through
the piece, and is at the back of the present effort to
again make it pay.
Evidently F. A. Govett isn’t “shook” on
the Mountain Queen (W.A.). In reviewing the Wes-
tralian assets of the Lake View and Oroya at the
recent shareholders’ meeting, he said: “Plainly the
Mountain Queen itself is not much use, but its second
string, the Transvaal, looks more hopeful. Yuanmi
keeps on producing, and developments are fairly
satisfactory; but the reserves are not sufficiently
blocked out for the mine to lay claims to perma-
nency. Lake View and Star keeps its end up and
steadily returns a profit of something like 18 p.c. on
its capital, and looks like keeping on for an indefi-
nite period.” Since Govett spoke the Mountain
Queen has fastened on to the Great Victoria, and the
probability is that this claim will be acquired as a
third string. # „
London reports that the total number of
shares allotted in the recently reconstructed Chaffers
(W.A.) was 463,828, and that the total cash received
by the co. in respect of these shares was about
£23,000. Reconstruction expenses are roughly esti-
mated at £lOOO. Judging by official reports, the
mine is developing satisfactorily ; but it has so often
failed to come up to expectations that the mill had
better be left to decide the point.
Ex-Queenslander Macleod, of 8.. M. & Co..
has been having a look at Great Fingall (W.A.), and
says that the No. 7 winze from the 18th level is still
going down in rich stuff, and that prospects gener-
ally are improving. Some people have an idea that
this show is looking a good deal better than official
statements indicate, and are prophesying a good mar-
ket rise before long. Sons of Gwalia was another
mine visited by Macleod in his travels, and he speaks
well of its appearance at depth.
Associated Northern (W.A.) has got lift,
of ore showing in the crosscut at the No. 6 level of
the Victorious (Ora Banda), and has done about 20ft.
to 30ft. of driving. Eastward the lode so far aver-
ages £7 per ton, and westward about 465. At No.
5 level the east drive has been extended to 315 ft.,
the last 20ft. assaying 465. The average for the re-
mainder of the distance driven has, except for an occa-
sional poor patch, been good. The co.’s accumulated
profits, made up principally of earnings from this
property, now approximate about £40,000, and its
investments are worth about the same. There are,
therefore, ample funds in hand to declare another Is.
dividend and lay out a bit on reorganisation of plant
for sulphide treatment as well.
From Westons’ (W.A.) : Greenfinch is
making small profits from the treatment of its own
ore and occasional public crushings. A lot has been
said and written about granite interference in this
show; but although present in flat bars, granite has
not disturbed the reefs appreciably. Operations
proved the gold deposit to be merely a pipe, and
values (or rather the best of them) disappeared of
their own accord. Myrtle Consols is reckoned to
have the underlay of the Edna May shoot at depth,
and to settle this point the Edna May is spending
£l5OO or thereabouts on boring. Meantime, it has
protected itself by taking the lease on a £7OOO
option. Edna May has granites on the south or
footwall side, and dark schistose rock on the north.
Whether the granites will cut out the schistose in
depth, and treat the reef in the same way, only sink-
ing will determine. ■ So far, there is nothing to show
that a calamity such as this awaits the shoot in
deeper ground. Above 73ft. the ore is good for a
length of 250 ft., and is being stoped out in varying
widths from 13ft. to 40ft. Reserves above this point
are roughly estimated at 15,000 tons. At 150 ft.
where the reef has just been exposed in the crosscut,
values are reported to average 3oz. for 13ft. Flushed
with success the co. intends to increase the output at
an early date; but many a good mine has been per-
manently injured by being forced to run when it had
barely learned to toddle. Edna May Central is soar-
ing like an aeroplane in price, and for the time being
seems to be well above its intrinsic value. Still, its
speculative value is considerable, and that is what
concerns the market most at present. A level has
been driven 400 ft. on the continuation of the Edna
May reef at the 76ft. level, and four winzes sunk to vari-
ous depths—the deepest is 56ft.- —have furnished assays
up to loz. for Bft., and the reef appears to be widening
and getting richer in depth. In No. 3 winze 200 ft. east
from the Edna May boundary the stone averages
30dwt. at a depth of 37ft., and shows free gold.
About 2000 tons of ore are stacked on the surface, and
a plant is to be put up as soon as possible to treat
it. There are others at Westons’, but none of them
are forward enough to mention.

“Bar None” : In my seasoned opinion
Randell’s (W.A.) is a pitfall and a good deal more
dangerous than has been represented by The Bul-
letin. For years it ruined almost everybody that
had anything to do with it, and when the supply
of fools ran out it had to close up. Later on, several
reputable mine buyers, including Wray, Herbert Moss
and (I believe) R. B. Nicolson, sent samplers to have
a look at it, but all came to the conclusion that it
was best left alone. Now, on certain representations
as regards values, a few knowing persons have ob-
tained, by some occult means, State water-supply
assistance to the tune of £5OOO, and are seeking to
get advances on a mostly second-hand equipment and
something resembling a mine. A good deal of crow-
ing has been indulged in over the fact that one of
these persons obtained, or is alleged to have ob-
tained, 10s. worth of gold out of 12s. tailings. If
this return was got from the old partly-oxidised
residues that lay on the surface of the Santa Claus
for years, then, unless my memory is astray, their
average assay value was about £l, and not 12s.
If, however, the 10s. was extracted from the remains
of a picked parcel of ore treated at Kalgoorlie re-
cently, then all that need be said is that nobody
else ever got such a close extraction from Randell’s
ore. As matters stand, an apparently mesmerised
Government is displaying a generosity towards the
field and those seeking to boom it that is simply
astounding.

“C.E.” : The just-dead Craven. M.L.A., of
Victoria, was in the front rank as a mining surveyor.
His best job was the incline shaft of the Long Tunnel
Co., Walhalla. The underlay had carried the faces
so far from the battery that it took an hour to
fetch up a truck from the 3000 ft. stopes. The travel
was up two separate vertical shafts and along 4000 ft.
of drives and crosscuts. L. W. Grayson designed an
incline shaft, calculating on reducing travel to eight
minutes. Craven surveyed it with brilliant success.
There was 3000 ft. of sinking, begun at two points—
the surface and 1275 ft. down the incline, and he
wasn’t three-eighths of an inch out.
Wallaroo and Moonta (S.A. ) has de-
clared a 2s. dividend ( £16,000). It tries to do it once
a quarter, but doesn’t always succeed. The market is
slightly above par, for the shares are 40s. paid up.
The annual revenue from copper, sulphuric acid and
bluestone is in excess of the capital, and, what is
more to the point, it is in excess also of the share
market value. So, if Wallaroo can earn a moderate
10 p.c. profit on its products, it can shell out divi-.
dends of 10 p.c. on capital. Its output of copper is
now at the rate of over 7000 tons per annum, as in-
dicated by the half-yearly return of 3610 tons, and
subsequent four-weekly returns (August, 567 tons;
September, 563 tons ; October, 430 tons). There
never is any official information with regard to
reserves, but the Wallaroo mine, which produces most
of the copper, is being energetically developed above
and below 2000 ft. There is some natural doubt
about the future of a mine that has been producing
for a lifetime ; but new methods of treatment, includ-
ing the flotation process, will certainly help to pro-
long its life.
Mention has been made before of the new
co. which is to take over the Mount Lyell and Wal-
laroo superphosphate businesses in S. Aus. Of the
£400,000 capital, £363,900 will be issued; and of
this the Mount Lyell Co. takes £136,900 in £1
shares in pavment for the Adelaide “works, plant,
stocks, and so forth.” The amalgamation of interests
will no doubt reduce costs of marketing; also, per-
haps, a little judicious watering will allow the co. to
pay bigger dividends without attracting so much
hostile attention. All the same, the farmer, being
a person much addicted to anti-Socialism, may be
confidently relied on to call very loudly for State
action if the private cos. try to make the pace too
hot.
Although one of the' most important pro-
ducers, Australia has, nominally, no zinc mines at
work. Still, Rosebery (Tas.) -zinc properties are likely
to come into their own. Zinc is the most important
metal at Rosebery, constituting intrinsically from
60 p.c. to 70 p.c. of the total value. Metallurgist
Harris, of the Zeehan smeltery, gives the average
assay of Hercules ore as 9.2 p.c. lead, 11.30 z. silver,
o.lBoz. gold and 27 p.c. zinc. Very similar assays
are obtainable from the Tasmanian Copper and
Primrose mines, which expect some profitable zinc-
recovery process to put them on the dividend list.
In the Tasmanian Copper there are 227,308 tons
blocked out ready for stoping, and still larger quan-
tities of “probable ore” ; but the proposition is loaded
with 325,000 shares and a debenture debt. It is
also bound by a contract with the Tas. Metals Ex-
traction Co. The returning charges are low, and
payment is made for zinc; but so far only a few
thousand tons of ore have been paid for, and a con-
tract that drags along at a snail’s pace isn’t fatten-
ing.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 1, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
The engagement of Victor Corkran, for-
merly on the staff of Governor Beauchamp
in ttiis State, has been mentioned. The
girl is Miss Chichester, a daughter of the
late Lord Templemore, of County Wexford.
Mr. Corkran represented the imported
sleek-haired P.C. and Gentleman Help
species in its most elegant and affable mo-
ments. His manners were once described
by a junior reporter as “polished Irish.”
The nolish, which was made in Dublin, never
wore off. P.C. Corkran, if he had cared
about it. might have graduated into an
Irish-Australian Wallington and a priceless
finger-post to raw Governors in this con-
tinent. Possibly his nerve for the Help
business was shattered at the time by the
good works of the (then) sub-queen, Lady
Mary Lygon, now Forbes-Trefusis. The
rather-shy Corkran was often pounced on to
shadow that haughty dame when she paced
round needlework displays and inspected
infants’ hand-made clothes or wedding
trousseaux for some Cause. He used to blush
like boiled beetroot into his hat on these
occasions ; but he learnt an awful lot about
Val. lace insertion.
Since the sudden disappearance of a
Goulburn girl named Mona West on Novem-
ber 5, we’ve had an epidemic of missing
damsels. Possibly in some of these cases —
one or two have not been reported under
scare headlines —the tales of she-wolves in
Paris frocks who kidnap young maidens
under the very nose of the police in mid-
day sunshine may have some truth in them.
If this is eventually proved the authorities
might suppress the flood of sensational leaf-
lets which worthy women, banded together
in various societies and leagues, are sending
broadcast through this State. The love of
sensation is generally a big bump on youth-
ful craniums. Put the two together, and
you get a missing-girl competition. This
suggestion may have nothing whatever to do
with Mona West’s sudden departure from
her distracted relatives. But the fact that
the police found two missing damsels under
most prosaic circumstances on Saturday,
and returned them both to their anxious
friends, seems to indicate that hysteria is
the most catching complaint of the season.
Owing to the Maoriland strike, the Quin-
lan co. will continue to die here to heavenly
music for a fortnight longer than the ori-
ginal invoice stated. Auckland is cut out of
the itinerary.
“Louise” made its third appearance at
Her Majesty’s on Saturday night, when the
stout d’Oisly, in the baggy breeches and
green velvet coat of artist Julian, and Jeanne
Brola. as Louise, took a big risk. In Act
111. they warbled a love ditty on a frail cane
chair that groaned till even hardened opera
goers feared the worst. But nothing happened,
though the wails of the seat mingled with
the velvet tones of the ’cellos. “Louise”
boldly asserts a fact usually denied by
serious opera. It allows a tenor to be a
really bad man—not a half-and-half sort,
but the whole hog. Tenor Spencer Thomas,
twirling on the toes of his patent pumps,
and clad in the raven swallow-tails of effete
civilisation, represented the spirit of Paris
in its most bedizened follies. Thus lured, at
the end of Act IV. poor Louise vanishes
into the night to the accompaniment of the
crash of a kitchen chair flung by her infuri-
ated male parent; and the curtain falls to a
pronounced sob from the Young Persons in
the gallery.
Mrs. Hugh Ward had John McCormack's
net colleen and her sister in the manager’s
box. Mrs. Fred McQuade, the chief orna-
ment of the front stalls these nights of song,
looked so much like her own portrait by
Florence Rodway at the Society of Artists’
Show that she only wanted to be hung in a
frame to complete the illusion. Numerous
stars of the McQuade family revolved round
their handsome mamma. A head bagged in
a large blue back-hair bandage gave a weird
bathing-cap expression to another stallite.
The owner of this headgear was too heavily
disguised to be recognised from the d.c.,
which had its own troubles in the shape of a
few pyramids of osprey. The George Earps
—whose present address is The Opera,
Sydney-—wandered into the stalls before
Voghera carved out a note of music with his
baton. The Ernest Broughtons (Mrs. Ern-
est was a pupil of De Beaupuis) also spend
most nights a week under the shadow of the
big drum. The Julius Caro dame shows an
attractive coiffure in the same vicinity.
This story may have been invented by
Ananias, but it’s worth repeating. The
heroine is a girl—one of those enthusiastic
maidens who take their seats in the gallery
of Her Majesty’s about 5 p.m. so as to cheer
the tenor on his way to big recalls at 11
p.m. She has been working industriously at
needlework in the intervals, and on Satur-
day night she was in the stalls, wearing the
completed garment—an evening dress. Per-
haps, on reconsideration, it was Sapphira
who had a finger in the invention of that
frock.
The Quinlan Co.’s orchestra played
Chopin’s Funeral March over the coffin of
Mrs. Richard Douglas in Waverley Ceme-
tery the other morning. The lady, who used
to be known in the profession as Miss
Queenie Le Brun, was the wife of one of the
members of the orchestra. Peritonitis was
the cause of her death. Some years ago
Mrs. Douglas was knocked down on the
Brighton-road as she was cycling to London.
The driver of the car kept on his course in
spite of this accident. For 10 months the
victim was laid aside in Charing Cross Hos-
pital. The police made unsuccessful efforts
to find the owner of the murderous machine,
and it drifted into the records as the Yellow
Car Mystery.
The opera season here has had a far-off
echo in M.L., where a whirl of selections
from lyric drama surged through the recent
competitions in Wellington. George An-
drews, who came out on top as champion
heavyweight singer (I suppose a bass may
be counted as the white hope of the musical
arena), got away with three leading events.
He is an amateur who has been studying
for several years under Nevill-Smith in the
Dominion. Baritone N. Smith is a big
Maorilander who is about one size smaller
than Samson. He wandered off to Europe
as a youth, studied singing under Bouhy
in Paris, fiddled in subjection to Sevcik
(who gave him a reference in consequence),
and for some years was musical editor of
the Continental Times, in Berlin. In
spite of this arduous occupation, the M.L.
baritone returned to his native land with a
fairly plentiful supply of hair on top of his
head.
Miss Alice Currie, who mothered the sea-
side-camp chicken, modestly repudiates the
notion that she originated the idea. It grew
first of all in the brain of Mrs. Francis
Moore, formerly of Angledool Station, in the
nor’-west of this State. A year or so ago
she wrote to the Sydney press suggesting that
this kind of help should be given to the
little burnt-up children of the bush. The
seaside-camp egg was then laid with a cheer-
ful cackle.
The Norman Robertson pair are settling
down (she was Neida Playfair a week or
two ago) to sort out the wedding presents
which fell on them suddenly with the force
of a tropical hailstorm. Elder brother Dun-
can, who has the Robertson station, Goree,
gave the bride a tea-set mounted in silver
as a slight token of his esteem. Harrison,
Jones and Devlin came with another gor-
geous offering in china, heavily wrapped up
in silverware. Dr. Robertson, the groom,
is said to have parted with about £3OOO to
buv a practice in a fashionable water sub-
urb. He’s a grandson of the late N.S.W.
politician Jock Robertson, of Free Selection
and freer language fame. The new bride,
who is a pretty little bookworm, is a
daughter of a Sydney meat magnate, Ed-
mund Playfair.
Prof. David, of Sydney Uni., who has
again bustled off to Europe, was suspected
of a secret hankering to slip aboard the
South Pole ferry-boat Aurora, and renew
his old acquaintance with Emperor Pen-
guin and fried blubber d la carte. He
sturdily dodged this temptation and booked
his bunk by mere mail-steamer for Britain.
In Edinburgh, he’ll be able to ask an infant
grandchild named Mclntyre what he really
thinks about the Scottish Sabbath.
Geoffrey McLaughlin, a second son of
solicitor John of that clan, was admitted to
the N.S.W. Bar the other day. A son of
the late Justice Cohen was his mate in this
legal wigging. The long claw of coincidence
brought them together, for John McLaughlin
was the lawyer who handed the late Cohen
his first brief. Barrister Geoffrey, who is
threatened with a generous helping of the
family brains, was private secretary to
Maoriland’s former ruler, the late Dick
Seddon, for a brief spell. Sister Beryl, by
the way, has a Bachelor of Science degree.
Another young lawyer put his head into
a mop of horsehair curls the other day, with
Justice Ferguson to see him across the Bar.
He is Leonard B. Dibbs, one of the North
Sydney “Bertie” Dibbs family, and a grand-
son of veteran banker Tom Dibbs.
A decorative youth named S. G. Gibbs
who le’tenants in the British Army Service
Corps, and came this way on the same ship
as the G. H. Reids, is here on loan. He’ll
lend a hand in some of the local militia
corps, I fancy. He may also instruct the
humble “colonials” in the Right Way to wear
headgear. Local Society, which has some
trouble on a windy day in keeping the new
season’s hats on the right patch of forehead,
is aching to find out whether the Gibbs
millinery (a saucy Army Service Corps cap
worn at an angle of 45 degrees) is gummed
on to that young man’s brains, or merely
ivilled to perch on a few hairs.
A wandering Australian who is still in
France records a glimpse of the Wilfred
Fairfaxes of this town. They were touring
the chateau country in a car that included
most of the comforts of a suburban villa.
With them was Mrs. A. C. Buchanan, who
also belongs hereabouts. The party was
going on to the river where Wagner’s Rhine-
maidens are presumably still giving exclu-
sive turns as long-distance swimmers.
The world is apparently getting so small,
as a tourist resort, that it is next to impos-
sible for one Australian to creep into any
hole or corner without finding another Aus-
tralian half a page ahead in his rush through
the guide book. ’Way up in the wilds of
Inverness, in October, some Sydney" folKs
were steering for the Isles of Staffa and
lona, when they met surgeon McCormick’s
handsome wife and Miss Alison Campbell.
Mutual recriminations of an affable kind
followed, each party being hurt to think it
couldn’t even do Inverness without bumping
up against its next suburb.
Journalist Hamer, the German-Viennese
wanderer and lecturer, leaves Sydney in
February for his native land. He means to
lecture through the Fatherland, Austria (his
Motherland) and France on Australasia as
he saw it in a two years’ tour. He’s a regu-
lar contributor to the Ziet—the Times of
Vienna —and has no fixed address. “Hamer,
the Earth, care of Cook’s Tourist Agency,”
is about the best he can do for the postal
authorities.
Miss Dorothy Stephen, one of the Alfred
Stephen clan, is still moving her easel over
Europe. When last heard of, the girl was
sketching in the Lake country of John
Bull’s isle. Dorothy, who is hon. treasurer
of the N.S.W. Girls’ Realm Guild when she’s
at home, will resume her place at the official
cash desk some time in 1914.
Dr. Maitland is said to have handed out
£12,500 for a house he recently bought
in Macquarie-street. The Pill and Plaster
business seems to be in a flourishing con-
dition, in spite of the tremors of the B.M.A.
Mrs. Scott and two daughters are booked
for Europe, and leave this port in Febru-
ary. She's the widow of the late Dr. Scott,
a former cricketing identity of Scone
(N.S.W.), who used to be counted amongst
its best-liked townsmen.
Still another musical pilgrim from the
other side intends to linger here. He is the
Butt-Rumfords’ late secretary, Roland Fos-
ter, who recently took part with that team
in its American-Australasian raid on Every-
body’s spare cash. Mr. Foster remarks in a
printed leaflet that he is an English vocalist
with a bass voice and a tendency to sing
In opera.
Mr. and Mrs. Critchley Parker (he’s the
thunder behind the Mining Standard) are
going to climb old Kosciusko’s bald pate
this month. Parker is an inveterate Isaak
Walton in his holiday hours, and the terror
of the fish in the upper reaches of the
Snowy; and Mrs. Critchley has caught the
fever from her husband. The pair show up
at Kosciusko hostel with a creel of trout at
odd times, then hurry off again to their
camp on the banks of the river about 15
miles higher up the valley. They set forth
with packhorses, tents, stores and a gener-
ally useful man to tidy up.
Captain Erzey, of Java, has been buying
army remounts here for the Dutch settle-
ment. This year’s deal in “Walers” hasn’t,
however, been as extensive as usual. Vet.
Surgeon Sardeman, of the same force, has
been peering into the mouths of the reputed
treasures. They go back to Java in the
Tasman.
News comes along of singer Carrie
Lancely, who has done consistently well in
the Fog. Lately the Gore Hill songster
has been warbling at the Birmingham Fes-
tival. A younger sister, Sadie, is moving
forward at the London “halls.” Such easy
propositions as “If I built a world for you”
are sung by Sadie with “descriptive action”
to much applause. The descriptive action
in this case would be a fairly large order.
Even Sydney wasn’t built in a day, so it
must take quite a week to knock a world
together.
Leonard Dodds’s youngest son, whose
dancing and singing are his strong points,
has just pirouetted into his first engage-
ment. It’s in the “Come Over Here” party.
Mrs. Mayoress Cocks, in a spirit of un-
flinching devotion to Duty, gave up her
official lair in the Town Hall to a display
of Women’s Handicrafts the other afternoon.
They’re the same Handicrafts we all inter-
viewed quite recently in St. James’s Hall.
The complimentary concert to the clever
Sydney boy, fiddler Donald Mcßeath, occurs
in our City Barn on December 8. John
McCormack, who is foremost in this busi-
ness, will sing the usual number of encores,
if he doesn’t drown Kathleen Mavourneen,
Mother Machree and Molly Bawn in the
meantime. The Tait management is pushing
the concert with the persistence of a batter-
ing ram.
The Anglican Girls’ Grammar School had
an evening party last week. Old English
dances, tempered with music and recitations,
began at 7.45 p.m. and moved steadily for-
ward till half-past bed-time. The learned
Principal, Miss Badham. who acquired a
heavy cargo of Greek and Latin at the knee
of her late father —Prof. Badham, of Sydney
Uni. —was in charge.
Our silver-gilt youths are cackling about
the size and style of the Revue girls, upon
whom in a few weeks the reckless spend-
thrifts hope to squander whole half-crowns
in chocolates and taxi drives. The top lady
Daisy Jerome (whose decollete photo has
fairly paralysed the shepherds of Sydney
flocks), is said to have a way with
her that will knock Johnnydom into a limp
heap of inarticulate worship. But, then
when did they ever say anything else of an
imported charmer?
The Liberal woman voter tied on her best
hat, and sallied forth to Dame Hay’s home-
stead, Crow’s Nest, the other afternoon
Seats were thoughtfully placed in proximity
to refreshment tables, and every comfort
for man and motor was laid out in the
gorgeous garden, which is wearing its best
early-summer frock. The Calico Knight
Macmillan (this is the right way to spell
it. Beware of imitations!) was the hero of
the tea party. He sparkled with a mild
ray of pleasantry when the proceedings
opened. “As my opponents haven’t left me
a leg to stand on, I think someone might
ask me to take a chair,” said the ladies'
favorite. “Isn’t he a dear —so clever!” says
one of the company.
The last mail from Ceylon brings fresh
news about the opposition that Parson
Waddy’s cricket team is going to find waiting
for it on the Colombo wharf. A wrathful
manifesto, signed by 350 leading natives,
mostly of the professional class, is now
bustling through Ceylon. It protests in
loud language against the visit of an Aus-
tralian team. No help can be given by the
All-White first-class Colombo cricketers,
partly because they will have a little affair
of their own on in Burma when the Corn-
stalks throw their baggage ashore at their
destination. The Waddyites, so far as Co-
lombo is concerned, will have to play
on the Nondescripts’ Club ground.
They will perhaps have a better time
when they get up country amongst
the planters. But they’re going to
munch a large slice of cold pie in Colombo
in return for forcing themselves on brown
brother when he is in a nasty temper and
doesn’t want them.
Angledool, a dusty hamlet in the Collar-
endabri district, has rushed into the seaside-
camp fray with a bazaar and other forms
of masked robbery. Mrs. Wiggin, a local
dame who cheered her forces on to this
assault on the countryside, is able to record
a clear profit of £6O. Angledool is the first
outback township to show any practical in-
terest in a scheme which is intended solely
for the benefit of the women and children
of the bush. It is therefore entitled to three
cheers to go on with.
The Shakspeare party will rage at Sydney
Cricket Ground without intermission from
April 21 to 25. The committee has just
mapped out a fearsome list of revels, which
include a youngsters’ fancy-dress ball on
Will’s birthday (23rd), and an item marked
“Ye Transgressors in Ye Stocks.” This is
a side-line, and the company who stick their
boots through the feetcuffs will try to look
as much like Elizabethan rabbit poachers as
they know how. Ye Living Chesse and
Ye Globe Theatre (“Ye” gives an antique
air to the merely modern cricket-ground)
will be extra attractions. The cash collected
goes into the Tercentenary hat.
The Osterle.y, which bustled into this port
the other day, dropped Sir Robert
Chalmers at Colombo on the voyage out. He
is the new sub-royalty of Ceylon, and is said
to have an intimate knowledge of the convolu-
tions of the Pali tongue. This ancient lan-
guage is probably very little altered since it
fell out of a top window in the Tower of
Babel. It is scribbled by the natives on ola
or palm leaves, as you know.
Yours affectionately.
VANDORIAN.
“Lex” : Sydney Telegraph says that “Sir
Edward Carson has brought himself within
the law,” and adds that this “has been speci-
fically shown on legal authority.” It is such a
common error that it requires to be scotched.
The whole difference between the position of
Carson and that of Larkin, the Dublin
strike-leader (the Telegraph was drawing
an analogy between the two agitators), lies
in the fact that, while Larkin has been
.offending against an existing law, Carson
has been concerned about a law that hasn’t
yet arrived. The essence of the crime known
as sedition is that it must be committed
against a law and Government that is in
being. Ireland is not yet autonomous, what-
ever it may be in the future. It therefore
follows that in talking of what he will do
if it should become autonomous. Carson is
on perfectly safe grounds. To threaten
that you will turn Republican or Anarchist
if Kaiser William is made King of England:
or that you will conduct a weekly pogrom
if you become Emperor of Russia; or that
you will cause bloodshed if Ireland is given
self-government—all these things are essen-
tially the same in the eye of the law. No
cognisance can be taken of them till the
necessary conditions arise. If Carson talked
civil war after Home Role had become part
of the Statute law of England, he would not
remain outside gaol for three minutes.

Wolaroi’s C\xp,
Price, l/»{ Post Free, 1/1.
By AMBROSE PRATT (Author of “ Three Years with
Thunderbolt,” ‘‘The Golden Kangaroo,” etc.).
With illustrations by Lionel Lindsay.
The Melbourne Cup annually causes more excitement in Australia than any other sporting event,
and Mr. Pratt has endeavored to show us a Melbourne Cup Winner in the making. “Inside know-
ledge” is the keynote of the story, and many of those who are in the habit of “putting a bit on”
will get their eyes opened as to the methods adopted by owners, trainers and jockeys alike.
Some chapters devoted to the taming of an outlaw are amongst the best in the book, and show
a wonderful insight regarding the varying temperaments of the equine race. The description of this
particular Melbourne Cup race is realistic to a degree, and sure to be enjoyed by those who love a
run for their money.
“A Curate in Bohemia,”
By NORMAN LINDSAY.
Price, 1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
As Australia’s foremost Black and White Artist, Norman Lindsay and his work are well known
and highly appreciated, but no one ever dreamt of accusing the artist of being an author. Neverthe-
less the fact remains, and when we say that the work of the author is on a par with that of the
artist, our readers will know what to expect. “The Curate in Bohemia” fairly bristles with bright
things, and the illustrations alone are well worth the money. That so much genuine humor can be
got out ot the adventures of the luckless curate speaks volumes for the ability of the artist-author
who has so suddenly leapt into the literary limelight.
Sodger Sandy’s Bairn.
By A. BATHGATE.
With six illustrations by Harry Julius
and a cover design by Percy Spence.
Mr. Bathgate is new to Australian readers, which is unfortunate for both author and readers,
for “Sodger Sandy’s Bairn" displays such an amount of ability that it seems a pity he did not ven-
ture sooner. He gives us some splendid pen-pictures of Scotch and colonial types, describes the
early gold rushes and their attendant excitement with wonderful vividity, charms us with his insight
into human nature, possesses a command of the Scotch vernacular that reminds one of J. M. Barrie
or lan Maclaren, whilst his fund of pawky humor is rare and refreshing. Scotch people especially
will welcome this book and want to know more of its author.
“ Bully Hayes: Buccaneer”
and Other Stories
By LOUIS BECKE.
(Author of “ My Native Wife,” “ By Reef and Palm,” etc., etc.)
Price, 1/-j Post Free, 1/1. With Portrait, and Illustrations by Norman Lindsay.
The name of Louis Becke is sufficient guarantee that the writing is strong, dramatic and
interesting, and no man knew “the Islands” better, or had more thrilling experiences there, than
this well-known author. Having served under the famous “Bully Hayes,” his personal anecdotes
anent that worthy are doubly valuable, whilst his other stories are amongst the best, as they are
the last, that Becke ever penned. The Author’s photograph, specially prepared for this work, is
characteristic and lifelike, and is a memento well worth possessing.
A racy sketch of the author’s chequered career forms a fitting introduction to his final effort.
“ ABORJGINAIvITIES,”
From “ The Bulletin.” Selected by CHARLES BERTIE, author of “ Old Sydney,” etc.
With 39 Illustrations by Lionel Lindsay.
Price, 1/= ; Post Free, 1/1.
Readers of The Bulletin, the most popular paper in Australia, will welcome this book with
enthusiasm, as it will enable them to enjoy afresh many a hearty joke that tickled them years ago.
Mr. Bertie has selected only the best, so that readers are saved the weeding-out process inevitable in
such a collection of contributions as appears in a weekly paper.
The supreme advantage of having an artist like Lindsay to illumine the text will be apparent
the moment you open this book, which should prove a mirth producer second to none.
To those who may not be Bulletin readers, we say, “Buy a copy of ‘Aboriginalities’ at once.
You will laugh and grow fat.”

ERNEST McINTOSH, General Manager.
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 1, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The drollest “movement” that ever was
started in Melbourne’s mutual admiration
circles has for its object the glorification of
Henry Gyles Turner. Turner, one-time
manager of the Commercial Bank, is the
exploded financier who was largely respon-
sible for Melbourne’s land boom. Years ago <
he retired from business pursuits, and now *
it is stated that he has been “rendering
various services to the community” all this
time. Also it is alleged by the chairman
and hon. sec. of the H. G. Turner Glory
Movement that the community is burning
to have a portrait of Turner, in oils,
hanging in the National Gallery—of all
places. Subscriptions to the “Turner Por-
trait Fund” are therefore cordially invited.
One suspects the prospective artist, whoever
he or she may be, of taking a lively interest
in the passing round of the hat. But, if it
were possible to raise the price of a
good painting by this simple device, why
order a portrait of Mr. Turner himself?
Why not keep his memory green by painting
his dog, or his ox, or his ass, on the under-
standing that the owner’s name should
appear on the frame? “A musical and
dramatic evening” in aid of the painful
cause will be held at the Athenaeum
to-night (Thursday) under the direction of
Archibald Strong, M.A. It is just what
one would expect of Archibald.
In the opinion of the Law the small and
good G.-G.. is not a god on wheels. The re-
velation was brought about by a traffic con-
stable who summoned a tram driver for not
pulling ud his rumbling caravan when he
(the constable) had signalled “Street
clear!” for the G.-G.’s motor. The con-
stable told the Court that his orders were to
stop all traffic until the vice-regal chariot
had passed ; but the Bench sensibly dismissed
the case. Well, no potentate who is looking
for popularity wants to see a city become
paralysed every time he is sighted.
I The Madden dame opened some new
crfeche buildings at Prahran the other day.
This institution flourishes its small pink leg
joyously because it crows under distinguished
patronage and is blessed with having the
kindly Mrs. Staughton for president. Mrs.
Donald McKinnon is also an honored mem-
ber, and you are told in a sort of delirious
shriek that “she isn’t afraid to ask for
money.” Last year she brought in hundreds
for the deserving feeding-bottle. Sad to
say, the big, breezy dame was unable to be
present at the pleasant function the other
day. She was far from these ignorant
shores and speeding with her young
daughters towards a foreign academy. The
new erbehe is large and airy. (Perhaps you
expected it to be like a damp cellar? Well,
if you did, you’re wrong. Not only is it
large and airy, but it has also room to
spread.) Just to show you how it is get-
ting ahead, I may say that its population
has bounded from 15 to 40 babies, and all of
them alive! Mothers pay 3d. per day per
child, or 2d. each for a quantity. A Mormon
might be able to arrange special terms —say
Is. 6d. per dozen. For this absurd amount the
infants get food and attendance from 7 a.m.
to 6 p.m. A nurse conducts the older chil-
dren to kindergarten, and a kindergarten
nurse brings them back. The new erbehe
has also a gate into the pretty Prahran
Gardens, so that the kiddies have practically
a park of their own. The only difference
is that anybody else who likes can use it.
The charity is well worth your support, for
it takes good care of Mum’s baby -while
Mum does your washing.
Musical Melbourne did its duty on Satur-
day, and attended Pauline Bindley’s Town
Hall benefit concert in trainloads. The aver-
age enthusiast was carefully wrapped in last
year’s opera-cloak and adorned with the hair
ornaments of the season before last. Ap-
plause was supplied by sections, according
to the artist each section knew personally.
Mrs. Hennessy was about the only “distin-
guished patron” present. She was garbed
expensively in cr§me brocade and black vel-
vet. Pauline is Bendigo’s latest production
in soprano culture. Though she is only about
a brick and a half high, she owns a tall,
shining voice which should not require very
much polishing in Europe. All kinds of
local talent put on their best dresses and
platform smiles, and came forward to help
Pauline. Florence Cooney, the blushful
mezzo, made a good impression with a fresh
v ung voice of good quality in Brahms’s
“May Night,” and was emphatically recalled
for a sweet version of “The Little Silver
Ring.” John Amadio fluted melodiously,
and baritone Bartleman, Jessie Cromb, and
a group of depressed-looking virtuous subur-
banites with thinning hair all did their little
bits. Pauline’s encore item from “Butterfly”
was enthused over till there wasn’t a whole
glove in the house, and a perfect Niagara of
vegetables fell over the rampart of undraped
palm pots.
Betty Paterson, a versatile youngster with
a voice and a sympathetic touch on the
violin, made her first public appearance on
Saturday night, at the Pauline Bindley con-
cert. Miss Betty’s violin work is clever, but
the people who know say that her voice is
her fortune. She is a daughter of artist
Hugh Paterson, and sister to Esther, whose
signature on drawings is now familiar to
Bulletin readers. They are a clever pair.
Uncle Johnny Ford Paterson did not preach
“airt” to his nieces in vain.
Miss McNeil, of Incely’s, a woman with
an absolute genius for wearing good clothes
properly, is taking to matrimony and coun-
try life this week. Her bridegroom is rich
. widower Thompson, of Albury. After a
Dr. Marshall blessing, at Scots’ Church, the
pair will depart for a motor trip through
Tasmania. They originally intended to
honeymoon in Maoriland; but the shipping
strike disposed of that scheme. Fashionable
frockers are saying savage things about
Thompson for carrying off their dress archi-
tect.
At St. Peter’s, East Melbourne, on Satur-
day, Frank, youngest of the Tait brethren,
was solemnly hitched to Miss Iris Barnard,
the young lady who had officiated as secre-
tary in the Taits’ Collins-street stronghold.
The pretty bride wore a white cloth suit
and had cousin Miss Finley in close attend-
ance. Dr. Lynch, her uncle, handed her
proudly up the aisle. Lynch, M.P., the fer-
vent Radical who has been gaoled for his
advanced views and aggressive expression
thereof in Great Britain, is another uncle.
Taits attended in great quantities, amongst
them brother Charles, looking like a stout
and prosperous American millionaire. James
Nevin looked on benignly, and Bess Norris
Tait smiled in a vieux rose cr§pe gown and
under a King Charles feathered hat. The
reserved seats were well filled, but there was
not much of a house in the pit or gallery.
Bridegroom Frank, in a Beaufort coat,
looked amazingly slim for one of his family.
He is presently carrying his bride off for a
Maoriland honeymoon tour, which will be
also a business trip.
Lawyer Hector Macdonald was married
recently, and is now on the long,
salt road to Colombo, where he and
his bride, who was June Clapp, are
to honeymoon. When they return to
these parts they hope to get into their
Toorak house by way of the scullery win-
dow. The edifice is small, and vans of fur-
niture continue to be dashed into it. The
popular bridegroom threatens to be home-
less, owing to the kindness and generosity
of an uncle who godfathers him in a splen-
did, overwhelming way. The last present he
contributed was an outfit of furniture. Then
the sisters of bride June, whilst travelling
abroad, secretly bought lovely antiques and
sent them along to further clutter up the
house. These vast presents, added to the
usual pile of sticks gathered by the wealthy
lovers themselves, makes the situation very
desperate indeed. It is unlikely that they
will ever escape from their furniture.
Elsie Kozminsky, daughter of the hat-
mills identity, is back from foreign places,
and spends most of her time shuffling the
trousseau treasures. She is to be married
on Wednesday, December 17, to Dr. Judah
Jona. The bridegroom-elect is an Australian
who got through his exams, in record time
and was never inside a whale. There is
to be an afternoon party in the St. Kilda
Town Hall when the wedding is over.
Mrs. Cornish’s sister Rose (the beautiful
Australienne whbse painted portrait was
bought by Queen Mary) has sent news that
she is about to bestow herself in holy mat-
rimony on a Captain Short. The bride-
groom-elect is now separating himself from
the unhealthy Gold Coast and fixing up for
a position in England, where a beauty’s com-
plexion is moderately safe.
Jean McCracken and “Dud” Smith (of
the Bundorah Park family) are to be
secured in holy matrimony on December 10
at St. John’s, Essendon. The excitement
in the McCracken home is intense, as Jean
is the first of the girls to go to the altar.
The elder sister, Joy, shows signs of develop-
ing into an incurable bachelor-girl. She
spends most of her time on horseback or
shooting up on the Narrandera (N.S.W.)
family sheep run. However, she is getting
a pretty frock made for the bridesmaiding,
and will probably stay in town long enough
to see Jean off. Brother Alec McCracken
will miss the joyful function, having gone
off to foreign places with cousin Bob, who
wants to spend a slice of a recent inherit-
ance. Bob, the son of Collier McCracken
and a relative of the gold-coining brewery,
is the heir to three different fortunes, rela-
tives on both sides of the family having
picked him out as a deserving person. It’s
great to be the lucky one in a rich clan.
Mrs. “Rubber” Edwards varied the usual
foreign tour programme by flying whenever
she got the chance —until her husband ob-
jected, partly on the score of expense. She
was “up” at Hendon, in England, when
there were scores of aircraft afloat in the
blue: she hydroplaned somewhere else; and,
when in Germany, she had a beautiful flight
in a Zeppelin. She speaks of the great
German air-pillow with affectionate fami-
liarity as “Old Zep.” People hardly trouble
to look up now when it drifts past; but
they have to take notice when it bursts and
falls into the teacup. The traveller floated
over three towns in the cloud giant, and
says it is so steady that the best motor on
the best road is a fool by comparison. The
passenger has no idea of the speed at which
she is travelling until she puts her head out
of the window and sees a perspiring eagle
flapping in futile pursuit, like a sheet
on a windy day. When you cross
a river, you can see your face re-*
fleeted in the water —that is, if there isn’t
a fog. Mrs. Rubber and her husband went
under a river at Hamburg. Lifts hurried
them down into the bowels of the
earth, where they found a smooth road and
motored along it till they came to another
lift, which rushed them 400 feet up
to the earth’s surface again. The device
was not made specially for the Edwardses,
as you might suppose. It just happened to
be there. An interesting fashion scrap sup-
plied by the voyager is that the Parisian
women are all in black. Their hats are
flat, and the ostrich or paradise feather
shoots out sideways from under the brim.
The long and lanky Lady Constance
Stewart-Richardson was witnessed danc-
ing in Hammerstein’s Roof Gardens in
New York. The new Tango dresses
are cut to above the knees in front,
with two flares of tulle at the sides to give
full play to the shins. The legs are bound
in jewelled ribbons criss-crossed from toes
to thighs. Just one layer of tulle veils this.
When his Athenaeum picture-show closes,
Septimus Power is off to the Murray to
paint some more scenery. He has his artis-
tic eye on the Yambla Ranges—the old
bushranger stronghold up near the Peter
Mitchell station.
The Overseas Club, which has widened
its policy and is bent on business, is organis-
ing a big garden f§te in aid of its building
fund. The Overseas is a both-sexes club,
and the shivoo is expected to gather them
in their hundreds and thousands. W. H.
Felstead’s grounds at Kew will be the scene.
There are to be “stalls” of all sorts, not
forgetting refreshments; also ponies and
motors, and a sports’ programme for the
kiddies. These latter will go in “on the
nod”; for grown-ups admission will cost a
shilling. The Felstead establishment is
about five minutes’ walk from the station,
where motor ’buses will be in attendance to
bear the f§ters to their destination.
Joan Meynell, daughter of Clyde, who
married young Patrick, is at present grass-
widowing in Melbourne. Her husband is
in America. Joan can’t keep away from
the footlights, and is walking on with the
Waller crowd.
The Harmonists —a male quartet—re-
cently did some tuneful work at the
Athenaeum, and are preparing to go and do
likewise in Victorian inland cities before
pushing further afield. Miss Annie Caddell
got through a few songs on her own, and
Miss Undine Crothers, a prettily-frocked
pianiste, supplied a little Chopin.
Hugh Paterson is busy getting the Com-
monwealth portraits together. They are to
be hung very soon in Queen’s Hall, at Par-
liament House. Someone who is supposed
to have earned it is to be presented with an
inkwell of great magnificence, decorated
with Australian birds, beasts and flowers.
The whole business is at present beautifully
veiled in mystery, and I am just dying to
know all about it.
The Charles Mills family will unpack
their boxes at Queenscliff for a two months’
spell, before taking over Laura Cumming’s
Toorak house, which edifice they are renting
for a year on approval.
Jimmy Macdonald, son of lawyer Mac-
donald, is out after the Wynne Prize, given
annually in Sydney for an Australian paint-
ing. Jimmy has been chasing sunshine for
the last few weeks in the picturesque Arm-
strong garden at Ringwood. He sits on a
hilltop in the home paddock, transcribing
the landscape with his brushes, and so far
no bull has shot him through his canvas
poem.
Mrs. Keep and daughter Heather, together
with the Askin Foster twins and their
parents, will forsake the seaside this season
for a motor trip round Ceylon. They leave
here by the Macedonia.
The judicial Hodge?, after despairfully
searching the suburbs for a home, have got
a delightful place on the Macedon heights.
It stands in the midst of a lovely garden, and
a creek is warranted to run for ever past
the front door. The house is to be enlarged
before the new owners move in.
Mrs. Rumor says the engagement between
a young soldier and one of our Best spinsters
has been ended by the Army regulation
which says the sub. shall not w r ed without
the consent of his colonel. Apparently the
colonel in this case did not approve, and the
girl objected to wait, especially as many
miles of salt sea rolled between them.
The Alliance Francaise is ruffling its bor-
rowed feathers and making ready for a
soirge at the end of this week. Even at this
light function the unfortunate English mem-
bers, bound by convention and fashionable
precedent, will have to mention in French
how many lumps of sugar they want. Terri-
fying facial contortions accompany some of
these efforts ; but the hard-working linguists
sit back with a self-satisfied air when they
struggle through. At the forthcoming spree
John Madden will present prizes, while tenor
Napoleon Boffard and Mrs. Jansen will at-
tend to the music.
“Rosna’s” latest message from London:—
Australian officialdom in London has just flocked
to Victoria Station to say a respectful farewell to
Chief Justice Griffith. He and his wife are going
to have a look at the Continent on the way home
They intend to visit Milan, dash through
sail over Venice, faint with fatigue in Rome, and
fly into Naples just in time to catch the Orvieto bv
the heels.
The autumn concert season has brought the usual
squad of young Australians to the fore. On October
21 Doris Barnett, a clever pianist with sheaves of
good German “notices,” wrestled with her large in-
strument at the Bechstein Hall. On another eve the
ASolian Hall was filled with the brilliant noises of
Arthur Alexander, from Dunedin (M.L.), and subse-
quently he was accused by the Times of an advanced
technique and a high degree of intelligence.
A coming wedding is that of Gwen Collier, a
Sydney damsel now dwelling in Kent, who is to
marry Naval-Lieutenant L. D. Mowat. Also, Leonie,
younger daughter of the late Ralph Gore, of Banana-
land, will shortly be bonded to Walter Owen Bentley,
of Regent’s Park.
A trifle of extra-theological interest
attaches to the diamond jubilee of
Christ Church, Haw-Hawthorn, celebrated
a week ago. Hawthorn was very small
potatoes in 1850. There was not even
a bridge by which to reach it. You had to
go by a punt, established by James Frederic
Palmer, who lived in solitary state in a
dungeon of bluestone on the crown of the
hill beyond the river. He had been a doctor,
but made and sold gingerbeer. Somehow
he was reckoned a miser; yet he was the
chief founder of Melbourne Hospital. Maybe
it was with an eye to his own estate that he
cadged from Governor Latrobe the site for
Christ Church, on the hill, next his place;
anyhow the now-familiar road was soon
chopped out between his house and the
church, thus dividing the hill in two. The
same Palmer was President of the Legisla-
tive Council when it met first in St. Patrick’s
Hall.
The late Miss Timms, to whom Dr.
Strong’s Australian Church is indebted
for saving its financial soul, lived in
Armadale, a suburb having high claims
to sanctity. Dr. Marshall, of Scots’
Church —from which the Australian Church
overflowed —lives opposite the dwelling
lately occupied by Miss Timms; and
there is a whole bunch of churches, all fat
and more or less sleepy, within a stone’s-
throw. The Timms lady was one of those
scarce people with the fad of building a
house around their ancestral furniture. A
large, squat, toadlike structure is the result
in the instance under notice, with every
apparent intention of becoming a private
hospital in its old age. This possibility
pleases some near neighbors just about as
much as the £5OOO legacy no doubt pleased
some near relatives of the deceased. A
nephew is an officer in the mercantile
marine, and a niece teaches music. Neither
of them belongs to a highly-paid profession,
so probably at least one niece and cne
nephew are at present blessing the Austra-
lian Church with considerable fervency.
From my Adelaide correspondent
Sartorially speaking Tattersall’s Morphettville
meeting was a failure. Blame not our taste so
much as the weather, which roved between summer
heat and something below zero. In other respects
things were quite tolerable. For instance, there was
a £34 dividend.
The housing problem is being tackled vigorously
by a few of our hustling female well-doers. Their idea
is to build a house in or near the city, and let it in
single rooms or suites of rooms at ss. or 6s. per
room per week. Also, a dining-hall and kitchen,
reception-room and laundry will 'be provided for
common use, and the tariff for meals will average
about 2s. a day. It is expected that rent and
restaurant revenue will pay interest on borrowed
capital, rates, taxes, caretaker’s wages and upkeep,
and the shareholders are to divide the surplus—-if it
transpires—in the form of additional shares. The
deficit —but why discuss such unpleasantnesses in
this glad springtime of the year?
Miss Ethel Love has decided to risk it with
Edward Gordon Spicer. Their future home will be
in N. S. Wales.
On Thursday Mrs. Ramsay and her daughter leave
for England, via Durban. Miss Kathleen Cussen is
also off. She steers for the Mecca of the indisputably
solvent early in January.
The George Milnes, the E. T. Smith knight, and
Mrs. George Dean and her son returned from the
usual old spot on Saturday. The Smith nobleman
celebrated his 80th birthday by giving himself
another motor-car. If he is arrested for driving it
furiously he can always plead incorrigible youthful-
ness of snirit.
The mother of W. J. Sowden, of the Register,
died on Thursday. She was full of years and religion,
and such-like admirable things.
The Bosanquets leave for Marble Hill in a day or
so, and there abide till their final departure in
March.
Naturalist S. A. White, who, with his wife, has
just travelled over about 1000 miles of Central Aus-
tralia, and particularly the Mac Donnell Ranges, is
back again. He has brought with him the corpses
of innumerable birds, beasts and insects, also a few
odd geological and native curios. He pursued the
flying game aboard a camel for the most part, but
his opinion of the Dreadnought of the desert as a
mount is low. Both he and his wife are as fit as
though they had been sojourning in a health resort,
instead of in one of those places where the white
person is supposed to perish miserably.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

“Nemo”: In past issues of The Bulletin
I have seen pars on the ill-treated white wife and
the browbeating Oriental husband. Up till last week
my sympathy was all with the lady, but since then —
well, what do you think yourself? It was at a coun-
try show and the man with the gong was informing
all and sundry that the local middle-weight Hindoo
wrestler, Otter Singh, was going to meet another
equally gifted local inhabitant. The bawled news
reached the ears of a good-looking, well built,
stylishly-dressed woman, who seemed to be consider-
ably interested thereby. Anyhow, she went through
that side-show like a rocket to where, in the presence
of a crowd of supporters, the combatants were strip-
ping for their work. With a gurgle of fury she
stepped up to the poor Indian and passed him a
right swing to the head that uncoupled about 10
yards of yellow silk ai d nearly lifted the proprietor
off his feet. “You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
fighting in a place like this! If you haven’t any
respect for yourself, you might have some for me!”
Every word was punctuated by a piece of his ward-
robe being thrown at him. His collar was clutched
around his neck, and a coat flung on his shoulders.
The middle-weight Hindoo wrestler moved as a dazed
man (after what he’d got I reckon he was dazed).
He picked up his turban-silk from the trampled earth
and mechanically rolled it round the place where
the cyclone had hit him. Then he strode out of the
tent, and the white woman watched her black trash
get well awav before she moved on.
IN 1925 A.D.
PASSENGER: “Stop, cabby, I've lost my hat! ”
If anyone is seeking information about
wombats—dead or alive—the Mudgee (N.S.W.) Pas-
. „ , ~ _ . ... „
tures Protection Board will supply it, as well as
specimens in any quantity. A month ago the district
had more wombats than it could manage, so the Board
offered 10s. per corpse, under the delusion that the
• . ~ , , . , , , .... ... . ,
animals would be hard to catch When they were last
sighted, an utterly demoralised lot of pastoralists
were down on their knees asking a local bank for a
loan to pay the bonuses. They had only about £4O
in hand when they made their rash offer, and that
didn’t last long when the funerals started, and there
are still 1247 scalps on the doorstep, with others com-
ing in. That means that the Board has upwards of
£750 worth of dead wombat oil hand, as well as an
empty treasury. If Mudgee develops a plague of
tigers, the P. P. Board will brain anyone who sug-
gests even pi. a head for them.
“Pick” : “N or M” (B. 13/11/T3) wants
to know if the wet-nursing platypus disgorges a
milky fluid in giving sustenance to baby. She doth.
But the milky fluid is nothing more than the mas-
ticated bodies of worms foraged from among the
water weeds and rushes along the banks. The platy-
pus is not a mammal; neither is she much of a
bird; but she- feeds her young after the fashion of
pigeons and other feathered mothers, which first
swallow the rations and then transfer a partly-
digested pulp into the yawning cavities of their off-
spring.
“Leo Lear” : To a person who has left the
South and put in years on the Outside, there is some-
thing tragic about the coming back. The realisa-
tion of it all is so different from the anticipation.
During the years of work and strife the rover gets
accustomed to tantalising visions of deep, clear
creeks; and even the columns of dust from the pow-
dered tracks seem to contain long, cool drinks. And,
as he throws another log on the camp fire, he thinks
of the city streets, the football crowds rushing for
trains, the dodging of trams and motors, the wet,
shining pavements, the reflected lights. At last, the
holiday—-back from the loneliness, and the heat, and
the floods, and the storms, and the sand! Now all
the pictures of his dreams are here; but they seem
to have lost their charm. Why all the crowd and
rush, anyhow ? And where are the mates he used to
know? Dead, perhaps, or even married. He pulls
up short as it dawns on him that it doesn't make
much difference to him, in any case. He feels the
discomfort of unusual clothes; he gets a desire to
shout and crack a whip without being thought a
lunatic; he reckons there are worse places than the
stunted scrub and spinifex lit by the long, sloping
rays of a blood-red setting sun. The shops he knew
are changed, the old pub is gone, and the ways of
former friends don’t seem his ways. Rounding a
windy corner a hand falls heavily on his arm, and a
cheery voice says, “Hello, old chap, where have you
been ? Gome and have a drink.” Then in a second
all is changed. An old pal is glad to see him.
(“Good luck!” “Good luck!”) Tobacco; news of
mutual friends; another drink (“Good li ’c
again!”); reminiscences; another pal blows in.
After all, it’s good to come back—“here’s howl”
* * * *
“Jimmy Ducks”: A pile of years has been
worn out since that day I went fishing along ti e
Murray with a party of full-blooded blacks. With
fishing spears in their hands, they swam out and took
station at regular intervals. Then at a signal down
went their heads and up went their walking tools.
They were under water so long that 1 was just going
for the undertaker, but forgot about it in counting
the number of big cod that kept coming to the sur-
face and floating down to where the gins waited in
canoes. Then —pop ! —up came the black heads, and
the river resounded with laughter and chattering as
they told each other how they had found and speared
a whopper under a log. Presently all hands floated
down stream about 100 yards, and the performance
was repeated. In an hour or so, the canoes were
loaded with fish, and we all went back to camp.
As the guest of the evening I was given the titbit—■
a river turtle laid in its shell on the ashes, and
cooked until it melted into soup. George Reid would
have given two quid for that dish.
“S. S. Severn”: In the grey-green deeps
of Carpentaria’s Gulf is seen a mighty Spanish
ghost galleon, of which pearl divers (Japanese,
Malay and Manilamen) whisper—whisper, because
to speak aloud of these ghost ships is unlucky.
As it was described to me the ship
lies slightly canted over, with spars
set and ropes unrotted; the captain
bn his quarter-deck, in wide great-
boots, chain mail and fine steel
head-piece; the crew, splendid in
Old-World gear, with knives stuck
through their sashes, all at their
posts. Each evening at sunset a
bell (the angelus, maybe) rings out,
and these poor skeleton-souls bend
their creaking bones and genuflect
and pray. Becalmed for many days
in a little lugger on the gulf (days
of no sign of life save sea-snakes of
many hues and much wickedness,
and nights of gold-starred infini-
tude), I stared and stared into the
sea and saw nothing, though many
times I heard the tolling of a
great bell. But one hears that in
any complete solitude, such as the
forests of Papua or the deserts of
Sahara. Anyway, I can swear to
the forests of Papua.
“Tiaki”: The man who tattooes designs
on hi s framework is not rare, but only once have I
seen a white woman with anything extraordinary in
the way of facial decoration. She was tattooed on
tlle lips with the tlull m oko of the Maori wahine,
aiK * le *^ ue on th e white skin gave her a
gruesome appearance. She was a “combo,” of
course—a white girl living with the Maori. Such
are not very uncommon. Some time back a prettv
£ ir l pakeha of about six came before a magistrate
! n< l '' er ;\ cf ' lol * ," as rna< '° to * ear Ler from her
foster-mother, a kind-hearted old kuia. The child’s
terror was pitiful. However, the old lady (who had
adopted the child from the day of birth which inei
dentally was the day of her mother’s’ death) was
allowed to retain charge. For months afterwards
the child would erv out in terror while asleep and
her fear of a strange pakeha would have melted the
heart of a stone statue. No one could be kinder to
these little derelicts than their brown foster-mothers
Still there is a strange and regrettable somethin"
about the female “combo,” a something like the
feeling one has for a broken-winged dove brought un
in a duck yard. 6 1
NOT TIRED ENOUGH.
COCKY: "I'm grin' ter sack that young feller."
MISSUS COCKY: "What for? Don't’e do the work o' two meet?"
COCKY: "That may be; but a chap wot's fresh enough ter read the paper fer 'arf a 'our
hevery night ain't wor kin' ’ard enough fer MY likin'."
“S.T.S.”: The horrors of Australia are
set forth in an English penny-dreadful, “Southward
Ho!” by Melton Whyte, now having a large sale
among office boys in London. The noble-hearted kid
(in leggings, with a bright red shirt) wanders
through this terrible land from one peril to another.
Happily he is well armed: “He slipped the revolver
into his pocket, and decided to take a turn through
the Bush in search of a wallaby.” With the trusty
weapon he shoots a snake and a kangaroo and a
bull, all intent on having his life. Leaving out
dingoes, drought, flood, bush-fire and a villainous
valet borrowed from melodrama, his escapes work out
this way:—
(1) The deadly Hotel. That’s the Shearers’ Arms,
the best accommodation house in South Brisbane....
a low, dark room behind, partitioned off like an old-
fashioned coffee-room. . . .He was seized by the hotel-
keeper.... a lean, wiry figure glided out of the
darkness and muffled his shouts with a heavily-
drugged rag. He gave a long-drawn, suffocating
sigh, and, shuddering, felt his senses slip into
oblivion.
(2) Marooned in the Bush. His captor drew rein,
and pitched him heavily to the ground. The fall
stunned him....He began dimly to understand the
hotelkeeper’s object in marooning him there. If he
survived the ordeal he would be too bewildered to
supply a lucid account of his previous adventures.
(3) Poison (unspecified). He plucked and ate
some ripe, luscious berries. .. .presently a feeling of
horrible nausea crept over him.... His eyes seemed
to be bursting from their sockets and his tongue
began to swell. He cried aloud wildly in the agony
which seized his limbs.
(4) The deadly kangaroo. The “old man” looked
immense, its deep-set eyes blinking viciously, and
its long ears set well back. .. .He heard the deep
boom of its tail as, lashing the ground, it leaped at
him. He fired wildly and with a horrible fear in
his heart: the creature swayed, rolled over, and
dropped without a sound at his feet.
(5) Bull. The heaving bulk of a wild highland
bull burst aerross his vision. The brute lowered its
great head and charged straight at him like a whirl-
wind. He snatched at the revolver, and aimed low
down.
(6) Serpent. That most dreaded of all reptiles,
the tiger-snake. This ferocious reptile, unlike others,
attacks and pursues, while its bite is certain death.
So swift are its movements that it has been known
to keep pace with a galloping horse and dart at its
hind legs. . . .The creature seemed to spring towards
him. The long coiled body gathered itself to pur-
sue. With the courage of despair the lad stood his
ground, levelled his weapon, and fired.... His shot
had proved mortal.
(7) Bunyip. A thunderous roar broke upon them,
seeming to make the very ground tremble. He
wheeled in the saddle and seemed to look straight
into two huge lurid orbs. He saw the black tracker
fall; something huge and black seemed to spread
upon him, blotting him out of existence.
No explanation is given of this last incident, so
evidently it was a genuine bunyip, the one thing
against which revolvers are no use. It is not, how-
ever, dangerous to white people; but the black
tracker—a stage nigger of the Uncle Tom brand—
was never heard of again.
“Machete”: “S.S.S.” in a recent Bulletin
tells of an insane Papuan who devoured a
raw serpent some cubits in length. It may be fitting
to add that the Papuan appetite is catholic in the
extreme, quite apart from any question of sanity.
I once went collecting vine rubber in the Northern
Division of Papua with a mate who had traded
and recruited for years in the South-East and the
adjacent islands. He thought he knew all about
Papuan appetites, but the Gira and Waria carriers
we employed broke him up. He first showed signs of
mental disturbance when he found one of the car-
riers roasting two live frogs and a bush rat on the
end of a string over the fire. That, however, passed
off ; but next morning, just before starting, he came
along quite flabbergasted. “Strike me,” he said,
“they’re eating the crimson mosquitoes!” And so
they were. When an insect settled upon any acces-
sible portion of brown brother, th§ latter first fixed
a basilisk glare upon him, and then, when the time
seemed ripe, tapped him out, and duly swallowed
him.
IRONY OF FATE.
“’ E wuz swallered by a halligator! You see,
it wuz eh’ brcedin ’ season, an' this 'ere
female.”
“Gawstrooth! A female!! Nuffin’ on earf
used to make Bill so mad as bein' slobbered
over by a female!”
“J.J.C.” : If the chief Abo-naturalist is still
down for the races will you ask him how long the
crocodile can remain under water? The natives say:
“Long long time; close up two pfellah sleep.” That
is nearly 48 hours. Some authorities state that the
iron-clad lizard cannot sleep at all under water, but
if you ask me how they know I can’t tell you.
(Continued, on page 24.)
ACCOUNTING FOR THE NOSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the recent congress of scientists in John Bull’s
run, one specialist declared that the chin of man was
the outcome of his habit of speech. A muscle at-
tached to the tongue and chin is most powerful in
man, and only rudimentary in other animals.
If the race does not develop some reticence, it may
eventually have to carry its chin in a sling.
Said Mo to Isaac Isaacstein:
“Say, Ike, do you pelief in such ?
Der human chin vould not haf peen
If beople dit nod talk so mudeh.
Dey say der chin it go on growin’,
Vile all der time ve keeb id goin’.”
Then Isaacstein, the wise and old,
He scratched his head a little while.
“Dot iss de tale py science tolt,
But toughts arise vot mage me smile;
Vy iss id, if such thinks as these iss,
My vife’s chin don’d reach vere her knees iss?
“Bud dere is some sense to id, Mo,
Iff looged at mit der broper view;
Youf nodiced dot ve Ileprews grow
A smaller chin as odders do,
Because descendants of olt Moses
Ilaff spogen alvays troo der noses.”

T ur bo- Alternator s
THE efficiency of any Turbo-Alternator depends, to a great extent, on
the ventilation system. In a “ Siemens ” Turbo-Alternator t e
ventilation is well-nigh perfect. The cylindrical rotor and special
improved system of axial ventilation effectually prevent any over-heating.
In our polyphase machines the rotor is a solid steel forging, manufactured
in one with the shaft—thus ensuring great strength. We have already
built, including machines now under course of construction at our Stafford
Works, some 144 machines of this class. Amongst them we may mention
Two 4400 Kw. 3-phase sets for Melbourne City Council.
One 2500 Kw. 3-phase set for Melbourne City Council.
Two 2000 Kw. \-phase sets for Melbourne Electric Supply Co.

“Eddyson” : I have known more than one
inventor of religions, but John Willis Gibbons was
the only man of the bunch who turned his abilities
to commercial account. (Dowie I did not know at
all.) Gibbons was an undersized, stout man with a
head very bald, very polished, and of a beautiful
rose pink. The baldness was extremely useful to him
in his business, since it radiated a sort of halo if the
light was artfully suspended. John, though he came
to Waddy with no flourish of trumpets, within a
month dominated the little wooden conventicle on the
hill. But the Cousin Jack brethren, consumed with
jealousy, used their legal powers to block him;
whereupon he hired Wasley’s stable, knocked up a
pulpit out of a packing case, and took over two-
thirds of the Wesleyan congregation. He had
originated the Zion Gibbonites, and the strong point
of his gospel was the necessity of praying with the
forehead touching the floor. This made heavy de-
mands oh the fat sheep in the flock. But religions
flourish in face of just such obstacles. The gym-
nastics involved became a favorite religious exercise,
and the spectacle drew in the ungodly. There was
something practical in the creed of the Zion Gib-
bonites, as in all the creeds their founder had estab-
lished. John promised believers renewed health on
earth in return for a faithful observance of the
tenets, and it is certain that the digestive powers
of the Gibbonites increased and there was a visible
buck-up among the flock. John featured an original
plan of taking up the offertory. No plate for three-
penny bits, no covered box to conceal the penurious-
ness of the regenerate, suited John. Ten minutes
were allowed for the collection. The giver walked
up out of the congregation, and deposited the gift
on the spacious pulpit in front of the prophet, where-
upon John announced the name of the giver and the
nature of the gift. The prophet took anything use-
ful. I remember one gift was a bale of hay, and
on another Sunday a devout farmer gave a bag of
carrots. Anything in the Sabbath collection John
did not need he auctioned at the Brothers’ meeting
on Monday. The wretch who neglected the offertory
two Sundays running was “named,” with an em-
phasis that covered him with ignominy. When Gib-
bons left Waddy, Brother Best, a well-to-do dairyman,
assumed leadership of the Zion Gibbonites. I next
heard of John Willis Gibbons running the Heavenly
Benders at Tumbledown. John was then featuring
graceful movements of the body to the singing of
hymns. He remained in Tumbledown about 18
months, and then passed on, leaving the Heavenly
Benders in the hands of Brother Glasson. In the
course of three years John established the Zion
Climbers in a South Australian township, and the
Rolling Souls at Two Mile, in Gippsland. Then he
disappeared. I heard a rumor that he had gone to
America, seeking a larger field. What I have since
learned is that the Prophet Gibbons always sold out
his religions after working them up to a certain pitch
of prosperity and skimming the cream from the new
converts.
“Caius Marius”: “Celia Lloyd” (B.
6/11/T3) goes into hysterics over paspalum—“there Is
no other feed in Australia,” he says, “that will carry
cattle and return butter-fat like this weed.” I vote for
Rhodes grass. In various parts paspalum has become
a pest and a curse, and nowadays its friend on the
N.S.W. North Coast is difficult to find. But Rhodes grass
makes fresh conquests every day. When the vege-
table was first introduced it was considered entirely
useless as a winter grass, but it has acclimatised
itself until now it is good all the year round. And
it has made itself at home where nothing else of
value would; I have seen sandy pine-ridges in a
barren wilderness transformed by it into profitable
feeding country. I’ll admit that it does not do well
in heavy black soil, but, giving that in, there is still
more butter produced on Rhodes grass than on paspa-
lum, and the quantity grows in the one case and
dwindles in the other.
THE BENEFIT OF EXPERIENCE.
SQUATTER'S DAUGHTER: “Yes, Susie, I had a
splendid holiday in Sydney.”
BAMARANG SUSIE: “What, you bin lookit out
find 'em husband longa Sydney? ”
S.D.: “Oh, no, Susie, plenty of time for
that.”
B.S.: “By Cripes, you plenty sensible girl.
Wait you get it husband like it mine, and
house like it mine keep clean. By Cripes
no holiday then, eh? ”
WATCHING THE PROCESSION.
“Gosh! I wisht unde would die. Couldn’t we 'ave a boshter funeral!”
“Flinderino”: Billy Dee, the blackfellow,
accompanied Mr. Tomlinson with a mob of fat
cattle to the Lake’s Creek (Q.) Meat Works. They
arrived at the works on Sunday morning and yarded
the beasts. That evening Tomlinson took Billy into
Rockhampton and had a look around town. The
singing at the Baptist church enticed Tomlinson
inside, and William cautiously followed and re-
spectfully seated himself a couple of pews behind
his boss. At the close of the service the parson
baptised by total immersion two young lady members
of his flock. Black Billy was interested, but non-
plussed. He dropped to it, though. “By cripes,
Mister Tom’son,” he hoarsely whispered across the
pews, loud enough to interrupt the ensuing prayer,
“mine tink it plurry ticks dam bad round here, eh!”
“Gouger” : Here’s some of the luck of the
game. Two days ago I caught the glint of some-
thing embedded in an ordinary white-ant bed. Close
examination proved the bed to be made literally of
mud and tin, which had been carried by the ants
from a creek close by. With
boundless energy I boxed
the lot, ants and all, and
in two hours was the
gleeful owner of two hun-
dredweight of good stream
tin. Thinking I’d struck
Alaska, I straightway
sluiced the creek, and in
a week cleaned up twenty -
seven pounds, worth shil-
lings a pound, minus pack-
ing. The ants had got the
lot. A similar case was
a copper gouger’s better
luck outside Cloncurry. To
his intense surprise he one
day came face to face with
a perfectly green anthill.
It was almost all composed
of carbonate of copper,
and close by was a good-
sized reef where the ant
masons had quarried their
building material. At time
of writing I am looking
for an antbed that glistens yellow, and when I find
it —well, give it a name.
“Fax”: The Finley (N.S.W.) lynching
case mentioned by “Ginger” (B. 23/10/’l3)
occurred at the old Murray Hut Hotel, which is
more or less famous as the stopping place of the
Kelly gang the night before the raid on Jerilderie.
The pub—which, prior to the closer settlement of
Tuppal station, constituted the entire township of
Finley—has now been delicensed, and the license
removed to a building in the new town a mile
distant. With the shifting of the beer pump the
old building will probably go to pieces, and a well-
known landmark on the Jerilderie stock route will
be no more. Even the old name is not being pre-
served in the new premises.
“Nunawadiug” : The acclimatisation crank
is at it again. He has been writing in Melbourne to
urge the importation of the mole—“such a blessing
it would be to farmers.” He evidently doesn’t know
that it nibbles at the farmer’s corn roots. All the
woes from rabbits, foxes, hares, sparrows, Indian
minah birds, and other foreigners won’t keep the
crank down. An important consideration is the
change in the habits of acclimatised creatures. Thus,
starlings, imported to Maoriland to destroy fruit
pests, left the pests and went for the fruit; and cats
imported to a New Hebrides island refused to touch
the mice, but destroyed all the birds.
“Kikori”: The remarks of my brother-
navigator “Gouger” (B. 19/6/T3) on the matter of
canoes inspires me to a word about the Dreadnoughts
of the Kikori River (Papua), near the place where
the frisky cannibals digested Dr. Chalmers, his friend
the Rev. O. S. Tompkins, and their dozen or so Pap-
uan companions some ten years or so ago. This portion
of Papua is a network of rivers and swamps, and the
only method of travel is by canoe. The casual canni-
bal selects a soft-wood tree, hacks it down with his
axe (American axes are coming into vogue since
civilisation arrived), and then roughly converts it
into what might be a very good pig trough elsewhere,
but is a canoe here. In these frail craft the guileless
children of nature (.vide Higgs, M.H.R.) cheerfully
journey about the crocodile-infested streams with as
much confidence as the Fat Man lolls in his P. and
O. liner. In the building of these Dreadnoughts the
bow and stern are not included in the scheme at all,
and consequently the canoe is open at both ends!
But the serene savage is able to surmount this little
deficiency; he gets a couple of plump, little black
Cupids to squat, one in each end of the absurdity,
with their buttocks well jambed down into the open-
ings, and thus is the river kept from coming inboard.
When the supply of small boys is insufficient their
place is filled by a lump of mud; but, as the latter
article cannot use a paddle or do any bailing, the
small Papuan is more often used.
“Billy T”: The case of Bennie Maclellan
is still borne in fond remembrance by most of th
inhabitants of Thistles (Vic.). Bennie lived in the
red cottage at the top end of High-street Hi?h
street is Thistles. That is to say, there is nothin-
of Thistles left when High-street is accounted for
Bennie Maclellan had a steady job at the co-opera
tive jam factory for the greater part of the year
and when the jam factory was not active he employed
himself in the manufacture of fruit cases, g
seemed an orderly and peaceable man, and Cora his
wife, was well regarded at Thistles as a goodly crea
ture, of comely exterior and homely habit. Maclellan
had been living in the red cottage at the top of High,
street for about two years, when one afternoon a
woman with a bonnet box, a carpet bag, two bundles
and a portmanteau appeared inquiring for one Ben-
jamin Maclean, alias Maclellan. She was directed to
the red cottage, and knocked at the door. Bennie
opened to her, took one glance, gasped “Agnes!” and
banged the door on his visitor’s nose. Agnes made
no demonstration. She merely put her goods in the
north corner of the verandah, and sat down on a
fruit case. Later in the day, while she was over
at the store, buying a loaf of bread and a tin of
sardines, Bennie sallied forth, and threw her belong-
ings over the fence. Agnes gathered them up again,
and carried them back. The strange female hung
some opened potato sacks along the verandah, and
slept behind them that night. For three days Agnes
camped on Maclellan’s verandah, maintaining a sort
of siege. Every time Bennie left his home the door
was locked behind him, and when he returned ex-
treme precautions were taken to prevent Agnes smug-
gling in on his heels, while Cora seemed to be on
guard all day to resist any efforts Agnes might make
to break and enter. Fully 20 times Bennie threw
Agnes’s possessions into the street. But Agnes was
a patient soul, and carried them back to the verandah
without complaint. While Mac was at work Agnes
resorted to many devices to break the fort, and suc-
ceeded at last by knocking down the sod chimney
with an axe. On returning to his home that even-
ing Maclellan found Agnes quietly taking tea in the
parlor, and Cora storming in a corner. Agnes merely-
said her husband’s house was her house, and defied
contradiction. Meanwhile the township of Thistles
was in a fever of curiosity. Who was Agnes, whence
came she, why did she, and how in the deuce could
such things be? Bennie seemed helpless now in
the face of Agnes and adversity. But Cora was still
full of fight. She sent to Ballarat for her mother,
and the arguments of Cora and her ma made the
top end of High-street vociferous. Then another
woman arrived. She was understood to be Agnes’s
mamma. The vocal contentiousness increased a
hundredfold without securing the dislodgment of
Agnes. Cora sent for an aunt from Horsham, and
Agnes responded with a sister-in-law from Clunes, and
the tumult became deafening. The only apparent
effect was upon the temper and bearing of Bennie
Maclellan. Bennie was a crushed and speechless
victim to the fearful feminine insurrection. It was
he who slept out o’ nights now. He stole to his
work like a man dogged by devils, he crept home
as a blighted and hopeless wretch might creep to the
gallows, and he took scratch meals with a sympa-
thetic collie in the washhouse. The storm burst after
three weeks of stress, strife and suffering. Cora had in-
vited the co-operation of a cousin from Koroit, and
Agnes had replied with a niece from Collingwood.
Arguments ceased at noon on the 15th, and assault
and battery were substituted on the instant. The
battle raged indoors while any indoors remained;
then it roared in the front garden, and overflowed
into High-street. At this stage Cora secured the
hearty co-operation of several townswomen, and
Agnes’s forces, overborne by numbers, retreated, fight-
ing a lost cause with desperate valor. The combat
was waged all along High-street, and out on to the
common, where Agnes’s broken and tattered forces
turned and fled miserably towards Coop Coop. Cora,
at the head of her party, marched in triumph to
the jam-factory to inform Bennie of the discomfiture
of the foe. Bennie was not there, but had left a
note excusing his hasty departure in the direction
of Asia Minor. Thistles has not seen him since,
nor has Cora. Wherever he is I am confident he is
alive to the fact that it is bad tactics to marry a
second wife while a first is still on earth.
A LESSON IN ECONOMICS.
“What d' they mean by protected cruiser,
EM?”
“Why, a boat turned out under union rules,
o' course!”
THE FOOD THAT WALKS SIDEWAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The crayfish industry is now at its height. The
crayfish come principally from Port Stephens, the
Seal Rocks, Cape Hawke and Port Macquarie in the
north; and from Bateman’s Bay in the south. Mr.
Jtayid D. Stead, Government fisheries expert, says:
‘ This is a highly profitable industry, capable of great
expansion.” —Daily paper.
Far down the coast, in tranquil mood,
The fisher dredges from the deep
The homing drunk’s well-armored food
That walks with him towards bed and sleep.
Far off, inland and sober, see
Some men in calculation sunk ;
They are the ones who presently
Will bear the emblem of the drunk.
There stands the engine, breathing steam,
That whirls the crayfish into town;
There waits the barmaid in a dream ;
There glows the liquor golden-brown.
The clock ticks on. Clerk, crayfish, beer,
Barmaid and all work in their mazes ;
Next day all’s well—except, I fear,
The drunk, who says he feels like blazes.

SMIATOGEM
“I HAVE
RECEIVED A
SECOND LIFE
rut' rerrp&sr
Hundreds of thousands of people have derived
immeasurable benefits
From Sanatogen
Thousands of them have written to the proprietors
to say so. Their testimony records marvellous results,
which, until its discovery, could never have been obtained
by any means at the disposal of the physician.
Among the writers are many celebrities with whose
names
You will
be as familiar as with your own.
Tens of thousands of doctors throughout the world
have prescribed Sanatogen, which a med cal authority,
writing in The Medical Press and Circular , states, “has
strengthened the physician’s hand a hundredfold,’’ while,
he adds, “the wonders brought about by this prepara-
tion are no less manifold than amazing.”
This is high praise for any preparation to
Receive
but it has been endorsed by innumerable statements.
Here, for instance, is one by that famous Authoress,
Madame Sarah Grand : “ Sanatogen lias done everything
for me which it is said to be able to do for cases of
nervous weakness and exhaustion. I began to take it
after nearly four years’ enforced idleness from extreme
weakness, and felt the benefit almost immediately. And
now, after taking it steadily three times a day for
twelve weeks, I find myself able to enjoy both work
and play again, and also able to do as much of both as I
ever did.”
To be so revitalised is. indeed, in Shakespeare s
words, to receive
A Second Life
That experience may be duplicated by every reader
of these words, for Sanatogen so influences the nervous
and muscular systems, the digestion and the great blood-
making organs, that it restores the normal balance dis-
organised by illness or disease.
Sanatogen is sold by all Chemists, in tins, at 2S. 6d.,
3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d.
An int resting and instructive booklet, entitled
“The Art of Living,” will be sent, post free, to all
who write, mentioning this paper, to A. Wulfing & Co.,
17, Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W.
Business, Bobbery, etc.
The ordinary citizen imagines the shoplifter to
be a more or less casual thief who runs a profitless
industry and a very great risk; but there is evi-
dently another side to the story. The other day,
when a Sydney woman was convicted of much shop-
lifting, the prosecuting policeman alleged that she
was one of a gang who had been “living on the
game” for 10 years; and “the game” must be a
pretty constant one for anyone to live on it, seeing
that, however ample a lady’s figure (it is usually a
woman who does the lifting; the job of the male
portion of the gang is to dispose of the goods), she
must find it difficult to transport any great quantity
of goods from a shop at any one time.
“J.D.K.Z.”: The thousands John McCormack must
have made on this concert tour and the terrific prices
paid by the Felton Bequest Trustees for pictures for
Melbourne Art Gallery set me thinking. Music and
painting being thus such highly-payable propositions,
can you tell me why such a fuss is made over any-
one with a gift for these businesses'? Money pours
in to send them ’Ome to finish off; yet we never hear
of a fellow who shows brilliant talents as a draper,
grocer or ironmonger, or even as a journalist, being
sent there to get the crown put on his attainments.
Why not?
* * * *
“Wonga”: The lustre of the “great primary indus-
try” is getting somewhat tarnished these prosaic
days. Minister for Agriculture Trefle (N.S.W.) some
time ago aroused quite heated remarks for inferring
that the hen was more profitable per ann. than the
bleating sheep. It was looked upon as an insulting
comparison. But it is a grim fact that the Vic-
torian Govt. Statist’s estimates for 1912 show that
the white leghorn Js at least challenging the yellow
merino. Actual figures of last year’s “crop” in
Victoria are: wool, £3,751,083 ; poultry and eggs,
£1,659,100. Considering the relative amount of
landscape occupied and capital and labor required
for the two industries, these figures must cause some
hard thinking.
“Melb” : At the last general meeting of the Tram-
way Co. manager Clapp said they had an eye on
motor-’buses. From this the public got an impres-
sion that the co. had put a bit of capital into
the business just to see what it was like; but it is
now explicitly denied that the co. has any share in
either of the two present motor-’bus concerns. Each
’bus, it is calculated, pays £ll6 a year in taxation,
m;ide up of £B4 duty on rubber (each ’bus using
three sets a year), £lB duty on petrol, £6 for car
taxes, £ 3 duty" on oil, £ 3 on licensing fees, and £ 2
for drivers’ and conductors’ licenses. The Melbourne
Motor ’Bus Co. has 18 vehicles; the Globe Co. runs
mostly taxi-cabs, but has one regular service. As
for the business elsewhere, on a day in 1906, between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., 441 motor and 1776 horse-’buses
passed a point on Edgeware-road, London. On a
corresponding day in 1913 there were 2324 motor-
’buses, and only one horse-’bus. And the new idea
isn’t confined to London. Bristol has corporation
electric trams and motor-’buses, and the Mayor says
only the motors save the corporation from financial
loss. In Paris the motor service is almost equal to
London’s; and New York has 40 routes under 30
companies.
“P. Harum”: Re Justice Heydon’s suggestion that,
with a view to eliminating one item of household
expenditure, shaving and haircutting should be added
to the new syllabus and taught to the girls in our
public schools. The lady barber is not unknown out
West. Charleville, in my day on the Warrego, had
two expert crinoculturists in the McKay sisters, both
of whom handled a deft razor, and got through
their work without worrying customers about dead-
certs for the next Cup.
“Marloo”: The Darwin Chow who told “J. J.C.”
(B. 13/11/'l3) that the wares he was trading with
the pongs of the China boat at 2s. a time were
iguana’s galls-bags probably lied for a purpose, said
purpose being to prevent “J.J.C.” from breaking-in on
his monopoly. Anyway, my Chow friend, on being
interviewed regarding “J.J.C.’s” statements, grunted:
“Plelly lie. Him clow-gall [crow’s gall]. Cure lem
evelly-tlink.”
“Omar the Tent-Maker”: It’s an ill-wind that
doesn’t blow somebody home. The deplorable scarcity
of dwelling houses in Melbourne has been a blessing
and a boon to local and adjacent tent-makers. Those
parents who find their families getting too large for
the houses they live in, and who are unable to
secure more commodious homes, are all providing
for the overflow in tents. There is a tent in every
third back yard in some suburbs, and where roofing
permits they are even slung on the housetops. There
are more tent-dwellers in Victoria to-day than there
were in the Roaring ’Fifties, when a hollow log was
the only other habitation for our nomadic tribes.
You see in the Age and Argus “Board and Lodg-
ings” advts.: “Tents and breakfast for single men.”
One Moses I know has hired an adjacent block, put
10 tents down, and bedded two lodgers in each.
To your tents, O Israel!
“Boswell”: Re handwriting “experts,” “Norbell”
(B. 13/11/’l3) confirms some remarks I made in
1910 with reference to the humbugs who masquerade
as experts in handwriting. Especially in country
towns this abuse prevails. Often a junior is brought
out of a bank and primed to testify to a similarity
in “fists.” Usually he will swear to anything, the
jury exchanging knowing looks of approval the while.
And let me add that it is very rarely he strikes a
Judge who opens out as Justice Hodges did, T’ve
heard a particularly blatant N.S.W. Judge meta-
phorically pat the bank junior on the back because
of his alleged usefulness to the case in testifying
that there was a “resemblance in the formation of
some of the letters.” How two handwritings could
be produced without some slight similarity in the
formation of certain of the letters it would puzzle
anybody but that Judge and his “expert” to tell.
Ftflther, it is only the “expert” willing to support
the police case who gets a chance to testify. No
wonder Justice Hawkins pointed out to the jury in
a notable case that the evidence of “experts” should
always be looked at with a tinge of suspicion because
of the natural bias attached to it.
* * * > *
“Brolga”: The Western Queensland Labor man
supports brother Pong, and there is just as bad a
state of affairs in the Eastern sugar country. No
man howls louder about his hardships than the
sugar worker, and no man curses the “capitalistic
employer” more luridly ; but he is blissfuly indiffer-
ent to anyone else’s hard mozzle. Three-and-sixpenny
flannels and one-and-tenpenny dungarees appeal to
him. The woman who sews them doesn’t count. I
was asked in the sugar country for an order for
a suit of clothes, and consented, but stipulated for
Australian tweed. They didn’t stock it, and hadn’t
been asked for it before. Yet that man had got
orders for over 20 suits from men on the job—all of
them unionists ; all of them avowedly Protectionists.
How would these same men perform if the sewing-
machine girls and mill operatives bought only im-
ported sugar!
* * * »
“Panjidy”: Westralia has produced at least one
woman with a masterful way of her own. She
was a school teacher when she became acquainted
with and married a rich prospector. They bought
a farm and began life on it; but unfortunately for
the lady’s peace of mind, the farm was within handy
reach of a pub, which hubby got fonder and fonder
of visiting. After using all ordinary means to cure
him, she bought the pub and surrendered the
license. Hubby came home very suddenly one day
and said the pub was closed. “Yes,” said the
missus, quite casually, “I’ve bought it. Here are
the title deeds.” He is still sober.
* * * *
“Boronia”: An attempt is being made in Westralia
to form a co. to extract coin and other things out
of the despised zamia palm and blackboy. It is
claimed that a patented process will enable the co.
to obtain glucose, starch and arrowroot from the
sticky heart of the zamia, which hitherto has been
regarded as a curse, not to say a cow. As for the
blackboy, it has long been known that much sugar
and alcohol lurk about its person, and that the
heart of the vegetable, when treated and pressed,
makes a first-rate fodder. Also, its gum, when sub-
jected to heat, gives off a gas which burns with a
dull yellow flame. Probably this resin only needs
to be purified to yield a good and cheap light. My
experiments in this direction came to a sudden end
when something went wrong, and my flimsy little
plant started out on a journey to the ceiling of
Heaven, with the velocity of a demented comet. In
the bad, mad old days the convicts and others used
to manufacture a very satisfying fantod liquid from
blackboy juice, and I guess some of the fantods
had somehow got into my boiler.
* * » *
“Counter”: There has been of late a perfect deluge
of high-toned advertisements for softgoods recruits.
In most of these notices great stress is laid on the
fact that the youngsters are offered an exceptionally
fine chance to' learn a “gentlemanly” trade. Appar-
ently the old snobbish bait still draws a certain
brand of parent—the one who doesn’t want young
Jack to get his hands grimed at a trade and his
Liberal principles ruined in a union. That dis-
astrous type of parent never dies out. There is a lot
of money in rags—but it doesn’t come the way of
the “gentlemanly” young man who hurries about an
importer’s warehouse. Because he has no union to
stand by him, he is rewarded with 255., 30s. or £2,
after he has put in a few hard-driven years learning
the fluttering job. It isn’t much good having a
“gentlemanly” job if you get less than the laborer
and a good deai less than the trained mechanic, both
of whom can knock round in any old duds while at
work, and in their leisure hours outdress and out
spend the poor young draper, who has to wear out
his one good suit in the warehouse, in order that he
may not look too shabby before his boss’s customers
* * * #
“Melb ” : Alderman Brenan, just back from London
confirms what Councillor Cabena, ex-police Commis-
sioner O’Callaghan and other recent travellers have
said about the eminent success of the motor-’buses
But the Melbourne streets will have to be reinforced
for a heavy motor-’bus traffic, he says; the present
thin concrete foundation won’t do for long. Assum-
ing that that trouble will be got over, he is nervous
about electrifying Melbourne trams, and doubts
whether it will be worth doing.
* * * *
A French firm has decided to collar the Austra-
lian trade in sugar-sprinklers; wherefore this circu-
lar has been dropping into all. the big hotels and
restaurants :• —-
“It is after a good experience acquired in manu-
facturing cristal wares for table use that I am able
to-day to submit you the most perfect Sugarstand
ever appeared.
“I beg to call your attention to the fact that all
apparats in use do not reach by far its scope as to
give an adapt thing for many reasons.
“First of all, because all sugarstands are not
covered enough at the top to prevent flys to go after
it.
“Second reason, that all machines in use do not
work smoothly enough, and consequently makes the
guest loose its patience in shaking all the time.
“The last reason is that the sugarstand, not being
hermetically closed, let easily dust go through, and
in this case I do not need to explain its desadvan-
tages.
“If you will only for a moment study the apparat
I am offering you to-day, from the point of view of
health, cleanliness and easiness, you will be con-
vinced that same do reach the perfection.’’
Peter Keith, of Perth (W.A.), went bankrupt the
other day, and told a staggering tale. He had
borrowed £2O for three months from Thomas Henry
West, a railway signalmen, and agreed to pay £6
for the accommodation. He paid off £lO 10s. at
the rate of 30s. per week. West then renewed, and
charged him another £8 9s. for the renewal of the
£9 10s. balance. On another loan of £lO West
was charging him £4 per month. In spite of these
frightful rates he had secured himself by a lien on
Keith’s furniture. Called upon to verify or contra-
dict these statements, West demanded 9s. 6d. costs
before he would speak; then, having collected the
money, and, presumably, tested it to make sure it
was good, he cheerfully admitted the facts. He
declined to admit that there was anything heartless
about his conduct, and stoutly maintained that 130,
162 and 440 per cent, were perfectly legitimate in-
terest charges. The Official Receiver declared West
should not be in Government employment. He
shouldn’t. What’s more, he shouldn’t need to be.

“Norbell’’: When my friend Curly Webb is suffer-
ing a recovery, he evolves Napoleonic schemes for
raising the wind. The other day Curly was badly in
need of a hair of the bottled dog that bit him, and
although he was, financially speaking, counted out,
his soaring genius easily overcame that trifling em-
barrassment. There is a well-known pub in Mel-
bourne where a deposit of one shilling is demanded
from anyone requiring the key of the lavatory, not
necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee of
good faith. Curly strolled in, marked down his prey,
and, having seen a stranger secure the key, tracked
him to his lair. And presently the unwary stranger
found himself locked in. Strolling back to the bar
Curly threw down the key, gracefully pocketed the
shilling unsuspectingly handed over, and departed
unobtrusively to find the hair before alluded to.

“Australia a wine-producing country!” in effect
says Alan Burgo.vne, wine expert and English M.P.
“Whv, Algiers—you’ve probably heard of Algiers.
Well, anyway, Algiers produces more than 20 times
as much!” Still he confesses that already one
bottle in every 13 consumed in England is Aus-
tralian.
LANES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The lanes that lie behind the streets where all is
bluff and show,
The noisy, narrow, dusty lanes, the truths of trad-
ing know;
No plates of brass, no polished oak, no names in
burnished gold
Are wasted in the shadowed lanes where battered
goods-lifts hold
The bales and cases that enclose the treasures of the
chase
Before they’re polished and arranged—each in its
proper place.
Here stand the patient, sweating teams till lightened
of their loads,
Then back they tug with jingling trace to face the
sun-baked roads.
’Midst whirling chaff, and dust, and yells they
trample out again,
To bring from siding, quay or wharf “stuff” wanted
in the lane.
On Sunday, when the workers rest and all the teams
are free
To graze upon suburban greens, or gaze abstractedly
Over the carter’s stable fence, the lanes are cool
and still;
Perhaps a sleepy warehouse eat sits on a window-
sill,
And sparrows whir from scattered chaff some nose-
bag’s overflow;
But otherwise, in shadowed peace, the long hours
come and go ;
Scarred doors, iron bars and solitude, and, past the
top floors high,
A wheeling pigeon ’gainst the strip of azure summer
sky.
So, after toil, deep rest—the rest that only toil can
gain !
You get the real salt tang of life behind here in
the lane.

“Uhe Public Safely Signal''
x
rpHE MAN AHEAD —whether he
be driving a team, another car, or
on foot —is entitled to an adequate, a
fair warning of the approach of every
motor car.
The ordinary horn operated
by means of the rubber bulb
is incapable of producing such
a warning. We have on hie
signed statements from more
than two hundred authorities
to the effect that safety re-
quires a signal of greater
efficiency, dependability and
warning power.
The list of authorities includes
the presidents of 90 automo-
bile clubs; the heads of traffic
police of 82 cities; the chair-
men of the legislative com-
mittees of 10 automobile
associations; the accident
claim adjusters of 6 large in-
surance companies; anda large
number of other prominent
motorists and non-motorists.
The statements are unpre-
judiced. They are based on
knowledge of actual condi-
tions —from the standpoint of
the public and the motorist.
The bulb horn has outlived
its usefulness. Often when

it is most needed, it fails to

unheeded.
Many car manufacturers have
discarded the bulb horn.
Others are rapidly doing
so. In America laws are
constantly being enacted to
require a signal of a more
adequate character.

In the City- THE “TIGER”
By lightly touching the Klaxon
push-button a short, deep-toned
blast is produced. This is known
as the Klaxon “Tiger."
When driving in town —in nine
cases out of ten —the "Tiger is
all that is necessary for an ample
expression of warning.
This impelling note penetrates
the noise of surrounding traffic-
no matter how loud; it is at once
understood as meaning danger.
Instant action is the result.
One “Tiger” is more effective
than a dozen nagging “honks”
of the bulb-horn; yet it makes
less actual noise. In emergency
it alone can meet the situation.

N?
In the Country —THE LONG BLAST
When touring country highways
the function of the Klaxon is to
give a far-ahead warning.
In still air its blast may be heard
a mile; under road conditions it
warns effectively a quarter of a
mile or more ahead.
The motorist with a Klaxon is not
obliged to slow down and “honk”
until the driver ahead hears him
and sees fit to turn out. The
Klaxon is heard far in advance of
the car’s approach, giving the
driver ample time to make way
long before he is overtaken.
Thus slow-downs and gear-shifts
are avoided; time and temper are
saved; wear and tear upon brakes
and gears —and nerves —are ma-
terially reduced.
TUV Klaxon is a safety device. The sole function of the Klaxon is to warn. The peculiar character ot the
Klaxon note is the result of scientific study of sound properties. It is purposely unpleasant, harsh, repellent.
It is an unmistakable warning. It is instantly and instinctively understood as meaning danger. Used as a toy
or a mere “Noise-maker”, or for any purpose other than that for which it is intended, it becomes a nuisance. Such
abuse should be prevented. If necessary, such abuse should be prohibited by law.

TO DESTROY DANDRUFF AND
MAKE THE HAIR GROW.
BY AN EMINENT SPECIALIST.
An eminent physician and specialist, who
has for years made a study of scalp and
hair troubles, states that practically all
hair and scalp trouble is primarily due to
the dandruff germ which eats into the hair
roots and gradually destroys their vitality,
making the hair grow dry, grey and life-
less, until at last it falls out and total bald-
ness results. To destroy the dandruff germ
and restore the glossy softness and natural
color of youth, he advises the regular appli-
cation of a tonic which can be put up by
any chemist at a small cost, consisting of
3 ounces of Bay Rum, 1 ounce Lavona de
Composee and \ dram Menthol Crystals;
apply night and morning, rubbing briskly
into the scalp and roots with the finger
tips. Do not wet the hair more than is
necessary. It won’t do any harm; but
there is no need to waste the tonic. The
trouble —the dandruff germ—lies in the
roots, and cannot be cured by treating the
hair itself. The regular use of this tonic
once a day not only keeps the hair soft,
glossy and luxuriant, but is also the surest
preventive of all forms of scalp and hair
troubles.
The above is doubtless the best hair tonic
formula known. As a matter of fact, it is
so remarkably effective that it is put up
complete and ready for use under the name
of Lavona Hair Tonic, and in that form is
sold by leading chemists everywhere*
THEY ALL USE IT.
“If anyone comes to our home with a cold we
immediately recommend Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy,” writes Mrs. Eleanor H. Blunt, Princess
Street, Bulimba, Q. “I have used it in my family
for' over 10 years, and all my married children have
reared their children on it. We appreciate the
reasonable price of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy,
its wonderful effectiveness and the easy manner in
which the children take it.”*

POLITICAL
POINTS
O’Connell’s great phrase put the policy in
a nutshell: “As much religion as you like
from Rome, but no politics.”
Vic. Premier Watt’s Redistribution of
Seats Bill abolishes three existing seats
and provides eight new ones, increas-
ing the Assembly membership from 65
to 70—which is a pleasing arrangement,
calculated not to jeopardise the vested in-
terests of sitting members. In detail it
gives the city 24 members; the “country”
46 —and that also leaves things much as
they are. Further, the quota of electors per
member is 13,198 for metropolitan as against
7964 for country seats —which isn’t exactly
gerrymandering, though it gives most of the
Labor electorates more than the average
number of electors and most of the Liberal
seats less. Not that these things matter
very much, perhaps, because the Bill is a
palpable “stall.” John Weary,, who apolo-
getically explained it to the House, immedi-
ately afterwards adjourned discussion until
about a week before the session closes.
Which means that it will be unobtrusively
shelved ; and then, while no sitting member
will be hurt, the Government will be able to
talk about its efforts to secure electoral
reform.
AS APPEAL TO PILE
COUNTRY.
England still loves us. In London the
other day a youth, with three convictions
against him, and now charged with attempt-
ing to shoot a man, was remanded for 14
days to give him a chance to leave for Aus-
tralia, whither a passage had been booked
for him as an assisted immigrant.
From “The Gap” :
One of the likeliest N.S.W. Liberals to go down
next Saturday is J. Macarthur Onslow, the rowdy
V averley representative. He has not made good in
the House. His manners have startled decently-
behaved men on both political sides. And, above
all, he has annoyed the civil servants in his consti-
tuency. At a local tea-worry or bun-battle of sorts
he arose unguardedly, and in his mellifluous falsetto
observed that a little honest toil was the medicine
these servants most required—with a few more re-
marks of the sort. That is to say, his political
enemies allege that he made these statements. The
Matson’s Bay end of the new Bondi seat is a seeth-
ing mass of civil servants. They are most of them
Liberals. And they all have it in for the wretched
Colonel over his supposed assault on their order.
They have in consequence concentrated on Farnell,
the Independent, and taking one wild action on the
Camden Park, warrior’s part with another, the fish
expert should about win. The Laborite has, of
course, no hope. By the way, Onslow's association
with the Peace Society lunatics who are seeking to
undermine compulsory service and the Australian
Navy is doing him a bit of no-good with the numer-
ous elector who reckons they are the best things,
legislatively speaking, that have come Australia’s way
since the introduction of self-government and the
abolition of the convict system. '

From Sydney Sun :
Last night at the meeting of Mr. 11. E. Manning,
the Liberal candidate for the King constituency, a
man knelt on the footpath and prayed for the elec-
tion of Mr. Manning. He was," after a severe
struggle, taken into custody.
Why hasn’t Danny Levy got on to this in-
famy? It is miles worse than the Alice
Wilkins horror. Under the Labor regime
the mere fact of a man praying for Liberal-
ism is enough, evidently, to have him hurried
into an asylum.

The precis of a Bilandersonian bellowdrama

intimation to his constituents by Tom ’Enley
(N.S.W.) that he means presently to rea-
son with them in a suburban town hall.
Maoriland’s Minister for Customs Fisher
recently gave the local House of Reps, a
glimpse at the poverty of the brewing busi-
ness in the land where no-license flourishes.
The number of breweries in 1906 was 72 ; in
1911, 60. In 1906 the 72 breweries em-
ployed 731 hands and paid in wages £92,308 ;
in 1911 the 60 breweries employed 741 hands
and paid in wages £109,544. In 1906 the
72 breweries produced 7,634,362 gallons;
in 1911 the 60 breweries produced 9,582,? 90
gallofis. In 1906 the 72 breweries paid in
beer-tax £103,986; in 1911 the 60 breweries
paid £119,087. If there were no other figures
than those, they would sufficiently condemn
the system of local option, which closes the
pubs on one side of a street and allows the
sly-grog hell to be supplied with liquor from
the pub on the other side.
Jack Scaddan, in Westralia, is going the
same way as Willy Holman in N. 8. Wales.
Returned on the sane finance ticket, Scaddan
finds it so pleasant to splash money around
that the gross debt shouldered by the hand-
ful of people in Australia has bounded from
£23,703,953 in 1911 to £30,276,436 in 1913.
and the net debt has in the same brief time
sprung from £73 7s. lOd. to £B5 17s. 2d. per
head-man, woman and child. If this ex-
penditure was doing what it is alleged to
do, the taxpayer would be better off; but
though taxes have been increased, the deficit
is growing-—-it was £36,453 in 1911, and
Scaddan expects it to be £447,000 by the
end of this year, which means that more
revenue will have to be sweated out of some-
one to keep up the tribute to Cohen. The
more you borrow the more you have to pay
in taxes —it is the experience of N. 8.
Wales repeated in Westralia.
Alice Wilkins and the figtrees have pretty
well overshadowed the question of land ten-
ure in these N.S.W. elections; but here and
there & small Labor voice has been heard
thundering in a whisper that leasehold is
the pea, while the Liberal has cried out that
what the country wants is freehold. The
Liberal is, on the whole, right; the real pro-
ducer, at any rate, wants freehold, and it
is simply because somebody else has got the
freehold first that he mostly has to put up
with leasehold for himself. It is an anomaly,
but true nevertheless, and well known in the
country, that the more encouragement you
give to the freehold, the more general "the
leasehold becomes. So the Liberal’s proud
boast that he has nailed freehold to the
broom-head doesn’t provoke much enthusi-
asm in the very places where he thinks it
ought to.
The other day the S. M. Herald poured
scorn on the idea that Ministers who had
made a mess of things should be put into
office again. “In a private business,” it
said, the thing wouldn’t be thought of. It
wouldn’t —and neither would the party sys-
tem, under which the ideal managers may
never be made use of. Yet The Bulletin
doesn’t notice the Herald giving much help
to the crusade for abolishing the party sys-
tem.
Melbourne’s Gaud Mayor Hennessy pro-
mises a considerable undertaking if he can
get the city and suburban councils to back
him. The Greater Melbourne Council Bill
being obviously doomed, and Premier Watt
having hung up his promise to introduce an
alternative Municipal Tramways Trust Bill,
Hennessy perceives that it will be the end
of next year before a controlling body can
be constructed, and by that time the cable
trams will be worth little by reason of pri-
vate motor-’bus competition. So, noting that
Sheffield (England) lately had to pay
£30,000 to buy out Private Enterprise in the
motor-’bus line, he wants to get in early
with a municipal monopoly of it, so as to
nurse the business for the electric trams
when they come along. It is a capital idea,
and Hennessy should be able to command
enthusiastic support in rushing it through.
“Any pretence will serve the Watt Gov-
ernment for avoiding work. To do things
means responsibility. Rest is essential to
the Willies’ of whom the Cabinet is
full.” That reads like a criticism from a
Labor paper. But it isn’t; it is taken from
an article in the most influential organ of
Liberalism in Victoria, the Age. Prior to
the last State elections, the Age sang an-
other song; and, when next year’s poll
draws near, the Age will go back to it. But
in the meantime, with immense courage, this
Liberal advocate wallops its own State-
House joss with vigor. The Age, however,
hasn’t the heart to beat its futile “true Lib-
erals” in the Reps, who are doing even less.
You see, in the one case, hostile criticism
doesn’t really count, because the Labor repre-
sentation is so small; in the other, parties
being just about equal, hostile criticism
might actually turn out the party which is
doing nothing—and that would be a cal-
amity.
Sectarian item :
The attitude of Father O’Reilly and the militant
section of the Catholic Federation may be annoying
to people Holman, who stand to* be prejudiced
by it, but it is absolutely maddening to the
A.P.D. A. The case of Holman affords a good
example. The fiery variety of Prodistan, who affects
a monkey-shave and wears strange habiliments in
public places on the 12th of July, hates Holman
like the Pope. Not once but many times has the
N.S.W. Premier appeared on R.C. * platforms. He
has always been an enthusiastic Home Ruler. He
was a pro-Boer. In brief, he has been pretty well
everything that the 12th of July Prodistan detests.
And now, just as his seat is in danger, Father
O’Reilly dashes in and announces that Catholics
disaprove of him, and don’t mean to vote for him.
If Holman wins, the Walls-of-Derry crowd will be
dissatisfied, more or less, Holman being no friend
of theirs ; while if he loses, the same crowd will be
exasperated by the knowledge that the event onlv
occurred when he was so rash as to scout the
Karthlieks and their influence. That is why puzzled
and short-tempered "Wowsers have been commoner in
and around Cootamundra than drunks during the
last week.

Higher railway fares and shorter tram
sections are under consideration in N. S.
Wales. Treasurer Cann hasn’t yet received
the Commissioner’s minute on the subject,
but he expects it any day now. So the
chickens of the borrowing boom are already
coming home to roost. And, as though
enough were not being hatched, the mad
Ministry, if it gets the people’s authority on
Saturday, avows its intention of putting
down another few sottirgs.
The land monopolist makes trouble inti,
most unexpected places. For instant
Pearce, ex-Minister of Defence, blames hij

tory at Canberra to be shorn down to a W

“Don’t take any notice of what thev sav

Does that look as though they believed the
Government’s policy was ruining the conn
try ?’ “They” also spent millions during the
last big borrowing boom in Sydney and Mei
bourne And when the borrowing boom was
over and Cohen began to ask for his money
banks shut their doors, and building socie
ties collapsed, and the unemployed marched
m processions, and soup-kitchens were
opened, and relief works were started on
pauper lines. That's the long end of the
drunk : what Willy Holman asks the deluded
public to mark is merely the brief middle
The suspension of Labor-member McGrath
for the rest of the session raises the question
whether any Government should have the
power to disfranchise an electorate in this
manner The idea seems to be catching on
among Liberal Premiers, too; for Denham
of Queensland, shut up a nasty critic
by heaving a member out for the rest of the
session. There are some charming possi-
bilities ahead if the idea is worked on a really
bold scale. Properly handled, it make's
it possible for any unscrupulous Jack-
in-office with a snap majority to disfranchise
the electors opposed to him, and defv the
will .of the people. If the power of sus-
pension should be allowed to stand at all it
should not be exercisable by a bare majority
but by a (say) three-fourths majority of all
the members of the Chamber. This* would
at any rate, save it from being used by a
party with a precarious majority to secure
firm control of the House.
The inevitable results of the N.S.W. Lib-
erals copying the organising methods of the
‘ Caucus party” have come. The local wire-
pullers have selected some of the candidates-
cliques have fixed up cut-and-dried nomina-
tions before the better-class candidate could
get a look in; and, generally, a group of
sore-heads has been created. Some of these
have revolted, and are standing “on their
Pat”; and here comes in the remarkable
attitude of the “Liberal” daily press. When
a Laborite revolted through sore-headedness
at getting diddled out of the nomination, he
was applauded as a noble hero, worthy
almost to be a Liberal; he was pictured as
a glorified William Tell standing against the
Labor Gesslers and the “Caucus tyranny.”
But now the boot is on the other foot. Re-
volt, which, when directed against the Labor
Caucus, was admirable and praiseworthy,
becomes, when it is up against the Liberal
Caucus, a villainous outrage, a traitorous
business, which offends against all the
canons of party loyalty.
It now transpires that, not content with
raising money from the pawnbrokers oi
Europe, the N. S. Wales Labor Government
has spent some of it with the shipbuilders of
Europe. There are yards and docks in
Sydney; but when it wanted a steam-
barge to carry blue-metal, the Government
passed over the Australian workman and
gave the contract to a firm in Holland. The
Dutchman gets the job; the Australian
merely gets the bill.
THE TARTAR’S DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Everywhere in the Orient Europe faces a new
rival—a rival in war, in peace, in manufactures, in
industry.”
Some fifty years have passed and fled
Since Perry’s blast imperious blew
At Nippon’s ports, until in dread,
Her closed gates asunder flew;
And now beneath a banner new
The Mongol proudly fronts the fray,
And one-time foes begin to rue —
This is the Tartar’s dawning day.
But late o’er China’s sleepy head
Her kinsmen’s guns their thunder threw,
And Russia mourns a myriad dead
Beneath Manchuria’s skies of blue;
Her warriors fought in fashion true
And proved their worth as warriors may ;
But vict’ry from her legions drew
To hail the Tartar’s dawning day.
For Western greed hath Asia bled,
And Western greed shall reap its due,
For he who lists may hear the tread
Of some new Timour’s countless crew;
And ye who fight, and ye who sue
For craven peace in craven way,
Must own in whisp’ring marvel, too,
This is the Tartar’s dawning day.

Root Pills,’ and although the aching pains
in the small of the back were severe, I had
almost instant relief. As a family medicine
they are unsurpassed. I have given them to

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Somewhere about 32.0 UO —mostly Gen-
tiles —swarmed in, at enhanced prices, to watch Mat
Wells, the English Hebrew, fight Harry Stone, the
New York Jew, at Sydney Stadium on Saturday
night. Apparently, there was no great love lost
between them. It was a wildly interesting fight,
worth going far to see. Never before has the Stadium
seen such polished, exquisite glove work as displayed
by Matthew Wells. He wasn’t the same galloper who
fought Mehegan and out-pointed clever Owen Moran.
That old Wells fought a rearguard action all the
time, and battled as he retreated. This new Wells
charged right in with terrific • speed but excellent
caution—and such glove work! That flashing left of
Harry Stone’s was over and over again either blocked
on the glove or absolutely dashed aside ere it could
land on his face. It was wonderful and beautiful.
And it was Wells who did the leading, and bored
in, trying to get his man into a corner where he
could paste him to his heart’s content. Stone’s skill,
on the other hand, was displayed in the control of
his feet and in the way he ducked his head and
swung his body. It, too, was amazing; time and
again he baffled the worrying Wells, and got out of
most hopeless-looking hot boxes by sheer agility. Yet
in spite of all the other’s skill, the Londoner landed
again and again, but it was always with his lighter
blows. The heavy ones, which might have carried
sleep with them, Stone always evaded.
In the eighth, Wells incurred the displeasure of a
house that was mostly enthusiastic over Stone, and
was warned by the referee for pushing Stone’s head
back with his palm. In the ninth, Stone started to
do the jumping Jehoshaphat act, and puzzled Wells
with it for a while; but at last that erudite dis-
penser of stoush almost winged him while in mid-
air. The applause was deafening. Stone’s spectacu-
lar display won the hearts of the multitude. He was
a dancing, elusive, supercilious, sneering Mephisto-
pheles ; and ail the while he chewed gum. He chewed
while he smote. He chewed while he was smitten.
He chewed while he was in the air, on his feet and
betwixt and between ; and he chewed while he smiled
derisively on the shoulders of the struggling, wrig-
gling, battling Wells. The 13th was terrific. Wells
went right in and cut loose in an amazing fashion
after flicking Stone’s left aside, and for lOsec. he
gave Stone a torrid time. But that curious freak
swayed his body so that its movements synchronised
exquisitely with the swinging of Wells’s fists. Then,
when the Londoner eased up, Stone came at him like
a cageful of tigers, and showered blows like a Monaro
hailstorm. He fought with a variety of modes that
was astonishing. Sometimes he used a straight left
fully extended, sometimes he carried his hands close
by his side. He seemed to have the knack of doing
the thing he was not expected to do ; but so speedy
was Wells he always seemed to adapt himself per-
fectly to the changed methods. In the 18th he came
out with the left fully extended, and forced Wells
all over the ring, punishing him as he did so Sud-
denly Wells flicked the fist aside, smashed Stone on
the forehead, and, following up, caught him a
vicious uppercut. Had it landed with full force the
fight had ended. But, think of it! Stone sprang
upward, and was soaring skyward when the cut over-
took him. It was the old swinging door again. And
as he came down he bashed Wells on the nose. Then
the gong sounded the respite.
In the 19th they rushed at one another. Wells
went baresark. So did Stone. Blows flew so fast as
they stood head to head that it was impossible to fol-
low them. It was Wells who broke ground, and
Stone danced in dazzlinglv. The 20th was savage.
Stone gave a minute-long burst of meteoric fighting
When that effort had exhausted itself Wells came in
drove his left into Stone’s face, and, following un’
rushed in with such fury that Stone was nearly
hurled over the ropes. As the cords swung them
back WeUs broke loose and smote Stone on the ear
But Stone, undeterred, charged into him, and another
whirlwind was just beginning when the eong sounded
peace, and Scott placed his hand on Stone’s head.
Wells stood still, with bent head, gaping in blank
astonishment.
The decision was popular, for it was a Stone
house; but whether it was a correct one is a matter
of much dispute among the cognoscenti. The case for
Wells was that he scored most hits, that his glove
work was the finest ever seen in the Stadium, that he
the fighting all the time, and from the first to
the 17th round (inclusive) was the attacking partv.
The case for Stone was that he faced an ex-cham-ion
who had the advantages of weight and the harder
punch. Wells was a world-famous man. an ex-
champion, not only of glove work, but of ring general-
ship, and he failed rot only to smash up a compara-
tive unknown, b”t to even mark him. He did all
he could do,_ and made superhuman efforts to smash
no his bewildering opponent, but failed utterly
Summed up, it must be admitted that Wells dis-
played, all the aggression and skill in attack. Stone
shone in his defensive and elusive work, and, after a
gruelling contest, in which he had to take a certain
amount of battering, he won the last three rounds
magnificently; and, moreover, bv skill of hivh order
though unorthodox nature, he nullified Wells’s skill
m attack. You pay your money and take your
choice.
Waldemar Holberg’s luck seems to have
turned at last, and on Saturday night he scored his
second victory in Australia, at Melbourne, over the
plucky, hard-fighting Frank Picato. The Dane put
up the same sort of scrap that he delighted and
amazed Sydney with when he fought Mehegan at
the Rushcutter’s Bay Stadium. He proved to be
altogether too skilful for Picato, whom he rattled
badly for seven rounds with clever in-fighting. At
long range Holberg’s dodging utterly bewildered
Picato, and the Italian boy failed to land any of his
weighty wallops. He was badly battered in the
eighth, but fought on desperately, to be saved by
the gong. Pulling himself together, he managed to
hold Holberg off during the ninth, but in the 10th
struck heavy weather, and was floored three times
in quick succession. Most fighters would have given
in; but Picato battled on, groggy as he was, and
struggled desperately to make a brave show. Again
he worried through to the end of the round. But in
the 11th, exhausted Nature could do no more, and
when he had been down twice referee Fullalove
wisely stopped the fight and handed Holberg the
verdict. Picato’s seconds were wrong to expose him
to unnecessary punishment in what was obviously a
hopeless battle.

•Tack Johnson seems to have had an ex-
citing 10 minutes in Paris last week. He has
always had an itching to enter the wrestling game
and in the French capital he met Liberian Seoul!
and fixed up a catch-as-catch-can contest. Spoui
became temporarily demented, and not satisfied with
Johnson alone, also endeavored to take on the
referee. His fouling became so ferocious that John-
son warned him he would use the champion fist.
Spoul retorted by trying to tie a knot in him,
whereupon Johnson smote. Then no more of Spoul.
There was fun at Sydney Stadium last
Wednesday week, when the pugilistic career of Jack
Jeffries, as far as the Baker circuit is concerned,
ended with a sudden bump. The youth with the
distinguished name, no doubt a descendant of the
able and erudite Judge of that ilk, was bashing one
called Brewer. He had previously outed the same
wight at the end of 14 rounds, but this time it
looked as though Brewer would be top dog. Then
Jeffries, after the manner of his race, went baresark,
and played all he knew ; and he seems to have known
a lot—everything, in fact, bar biting. His worst
offence was the way he lifted his knee; and the
audience got up and roared and cursed. Baker him-
self, usually a most serene man, went furious, and
howled to Jeffries to get out of the ring and leave
the Stadium, disqualified for life.
That tussle between Professor Stevenson
and Sam McVea at Lismore (N.S.W.) seems to have
been a shockingly unfair business, according to a
report by Dr. Gaggin, the Government Medical
Officer. McVea weighed nearly 16st. He was in
partial training and perfect health. He could hit as
hard as he liked, and was at liberty to “out”' the
professor. Stevenson, on the other hand, weighed
barely list. He was much shorter than McVea, who
is sft. 10|in. high ; Re was only four weeks out of
a sick bed and not quite recovered from an attack
of dengue fever ; and, above all, he was not to be
allowed to “out” McVea by jiu-jitsu methods. Pun-
ishment was to cease immediately McVea tapped the
floor as a sign of surrender. McVea would agree to
the match only on those conditions. Yet, though
Stevenson was tied down so tight, during the first
four rounds McVea was quite helpless. He could
not hit Stevenson, and was dragged down and made
to surrender very quickly. The audience, which
knew nothing about jiu-jitsu, could not see why he
was unable to hit, and jumped to the conclusion that
it was a fake. After reading the doctor’s account
there is no doubt as to the genuineness of the con-
test ; also, there is no doubt as to the relative
values of boxing and jiu-jitsu as a means of defence.
As the doctor says, we haven’t a fighter who could
stand up against McVea for four rounds; yet this
sick man, nearly sst. lighter, without striking a
blow, downed him four times in quick succession,
and could have sent him to the hospital or the ceme-
tery on each occasion had he so desired. Moral: If
you want to be able to take your own part effect-
ively, learn jiu-jitsu.

Tennis players back in S. Aus. from
Perth say glowing things of the improvement in the
game in Westralia. Ernest Parker (who was for-
merly at school in Adelaide) has come on so much
that in the recent tournament he beat his famous
namesake, H. A. Parker, and also Roy Taylor, the
Adelaide champion.
North Sydney wicket-keeper E. J. Long
put up a splendid performance against Balmain
recently, when, in a tally of 318 runs, scored off 522
balls, not a single bye was allowed to help the other
sides score. Has the Ma State selection committee
got its glittering eye glued on Long? It should
have.
“ You couldn't see the ring for noses.” Harry
Stone (U.S.A.) is given the verdict over Matt
Wells (the hairy Cohentander) before a large
attendance of the Chosen ones at the Sydney
Stadium.
The sixth round of Sydney First-Grade
Cricket commenced on Saturday on wickets that were
excellent and in weather that was charming though
hot. The previous Saturday’s slaughter of the ball
was bitterly avenged, and only two centuries graced
the burning afternoon. The star batsman was Rix, of
Redfern, who smote 110 off the bowling of Gordon
before Macartney got him with a beautiful straight
one. Davis, of Waverley, had just reached the cen-
tury when he put his leg in front in trying to slog
one from Cotter. After that, the best was the 78
(n. 0.) of Macartney for Gordon and the 64 of Pite for
waverley. None of the club scores were at all
startling, the best being the 248 for nine wickets of
Western Suburbs off the bowling of Sydney. Waverley
biffed 236 off Glebe, and then got one Glebe man out
tor 27. Paddington smacked 226 off Balmain, which
immediately lost three for 42 —a mighty bad start.
Redfern lifted 208 off Gordon, and felt very blue
about the gills when Wade’s merry electors ran up
187 for two wickets. Petersham was disgusted at
making only 195 against Central Cumberland, but it
felt more cheerful when it dismissed five Parra-
mattaites _ for a miserable 57, and decided life was
worth living. North Sydney seems to be in a bad
way with University, the Students having smashed it
for 124 and then hit up 134 for nine wickets. The
roal hero of the afternoon was Massie, of University
who bowled seven North Sydneyites for 66. His runner-
up was Scott, of Gordon, with six Redfern wickets
for 49. Coogan, of Central Cumberland, got six for
' an “ Penman, of Balmain, five for 69. Folkard
°* Baknain, and Macartney, of Gordon, and Cotter’
of Glebe, each got four—for 95, 85 and 78 respec-
tively. ‘ *

It is not often that an athlete expires
with cheers of praise ringing in his ears; but it
happened the other day at Shellharbor (N SW )
George Bursill, playing with the local XI, fell and
died when waving his hat in acknowledgment of the
crowd s applause for a boundary hit.
The St. Kilda (Vic.) Yacht Club’s handi-
cap on Saturday was an exciting affair over a 12-
miles square course. As there were only three start-
ers the third prize was cut out. The race in
a blizzard-like southerly which lashed the waves of
Port Phillip to fury. Siren conceded 14 and 20
minutes respectively to Paringa and Killara. They
went off on a flying start almost simultaneously,
and all three battled through the heavy seas magni-
ficently. Then the wind moderated somewhat, and
things became more pleasant. Siren had just made
up her handicap on both distance boats, when the
bobstay carried away, and 10 precious minutes were
lost refitting it. That done, once more Siren went
in pursuit. The wind began to rise again, but the
pursuer took risks, and drove through the seething
water in magnificent style. A fearful squall caused
Paringa and Killara to slow down, but Siren rode on
the wings of it, and, rushing past, finished 13min.
13sec. ahead of Paringa, with Killara in the rear.
It was a great performance, but it wasn't enough;
for, when the handicaps were allowed, Paringa had
won by 47 seconds. An appeal was lodged against
Paringa relative to the passing of some mark, and
the sailing committee will consider the question
through the week. But, however it goes, it was a
great race.
The Prince Alfred Yacht Club (Sydney)
had a grim N.E. wind and, a choppy sea for the
first of its ocean races on Saturday, when the fleet,
divided into “A” and “B” classes, raced from Fort
Denison to South Reef and back. The “B” class
were contesting for the Sunny Ridge trophies, pre-
sented by an inland squatter named Fagan, who was
on board the following steamer. The “A’s” battled
for a club trophy worth eight guineas. The stiff
breeze suited the big Sayonara right down to the
water, so that, after allowing the formidable Cul-
wulla 111. two minutes start, it overtook the black
yacht at the Heads. The race for first position ended
right there, and interest settled on the struggle
between sky-scraping Rawhiti and Culwulla for
second place. Rawhiti won it-—lmin. 42see. behind
Sayonara.
The Sunny Ridge trophies represented 10,
five and three guineas respectively for first, second
and third places, and as there were only four yachts
entered, the race was the sort that should appeal
to the heart. The Noj-thcote Cup candidate, Rawhiti
11., was among them, and considerable interest
attached to its performance. There was disappoint-
ment when it became apparent that it was hopelessly
outclassed. In fact, it retired shortly after reaching
the ocean. Petrel led the course round the mark,
followed by Aoma and Ranee in that order, 3min.
28sec. and 4min. 4sec. behind respectively. Then
the canvas was crowded on for the run home, and
the yachts disappeared under white clouds, plunging
away through the choppy sea. Ranee overhauled
Aoma, and went bobbing past, but had no chance
against the speedy Petrel, which, bird-like, swept
gracefully ahead, and won by 3min. 47sec. from
Ranee. The latter beat Aoma by 3min. 15sec.
In the Flying Squadron’s handicap Desde-
mona gave a display of speed in the first heat
which staggered even the oldest mariner. Along
one side of the triangle Othello’s wife was a
mighty bad fourth, but at the turn she went gay,
and fairly flew over the other two sides, beating
everything clean out of sight, and leaving the rush-
ing Arline 75 seconds behind. The second heat
was a walk-over for the Australian champion Kismet.
The sensation on this bout was the failure of
Christian Webb’s wonderful Australian to qualify
for the final—an unheard-of thing. When the final
blew along Desdemona tried to repeat the speed
burst, but for some reason failed to do so. Mona’s
spinnaker split to ribbons with a bang, and the race
resolved its.elf into a struggle between Arline,
which was splendidly handled, and Kismet and
Desdemona. Arline struggled first out of the heap
and swept away from Kismet, which, coming with
a burst of splendid speed, left Desdemona standing
comparatively still. Arline won by 10 seconds and
Kismet finished 25 seconds ahead of Desdemona.
Hats off to H. Thompson, of the
(N.S.W.) South Sydney Harriers. On Saturday last,
at the Sports Ground, he won the 161 b. shot, the
broad jump, dead-heated in the pole vault, and was
just defeated in the high-jump. A girl onlooker
remarked at the finish—“ What sort of a hug could
he give!” and roused quite an interesting train of
speculations. Also, caps off to young J. McLennan,
of the Mozart Junior Harriers, who won the 100yds.,
220yds. and 440yds. handicaps, dead-heated in
the mile event, and ran second in the 75yds. handi-
cap. A mighty close effort to scoop the whole pool,
banks and all.
The devouring All Blacks finished their
American tour with an amazing record, having
won the whole 15 matches played, and scored 576
points to six. Of course, this is reducing the tour-
ing business to absurdity. There’s no glory about
it. The Americans, neither in the United States
nor Canada, can play the Rugby game, and they
were just trampled underfoot.

The infernal luck of aeroplaning. French
wonder Perryon was last week killed by his mono-
plane falling a miserable 50ft. Think of it! Last
March, in a Bleriot monoplane, he climbed 19.600 ft.
towards the stars, and came back, very cold, to teli
what it was like. In June he took a passenger
16,270 ft. towards the empyrean, and brought him
back safely, but with his teeth rattling. Both
these flights were world records. And then 50ft.!

The chief item in the Summer Baseball
competition at Sydney Agricultural Ground on Satur-
day was the match between the Waverley Red and Blue
Sox. There is too much imitation of cheap Yankee
nomenclature about this altogether; Australian teams
should get names of local significance. Over a thou-
sand people looked on, and although faults were
many, the game was interesting throughout. The
Blues batted first, and partly by good luck, partly by
reason of blunders and a dash"of smart play, scored
nine men hofne. When Reds responded they got only
two home, and that fearsome handicap was never
wiped out, so that when the numbers went up it was
found that the Blues had won with 16 to 11. The
second event, Petersham v. Leichhardt, wasn’t a game
at all. It was a dog-walloping, with Petersham the
dog, 17 to one.

How the Cbok Government does scatter
the bait around ! No less than £2OOO is on the
estimates to facilitate the dispatch of a rifle team
to take part in the English Bisley meeting. If the
country was rolling in money, and if there were no
wild shouts for more accommodation and facilities
for riflemen to practise, it might be logical. But it
is madness to spend £2OOO in sending a team to
England while the rank and file of our shooters on
whom we must depend in battle-day, have to forego
practice for want of bull’s-eyes to practise on

The Lunacy Department of the Wean-
State developed an unexpected vein of cynicism whin
on Cup day it allowed a party of 10 patients, with
two attendants, to take a dav off from the n™
Mont Park lunatic asylum and 'spend it at Fleming
ton. Presumably they took the odds offered bv th
books in the same docile fashion as the other imhn
ciles present.
Loch Amos, the Wallace gee that won the
Sandhurst Cup in handsome style, is alleged to have
been a doubtful starter until “inducements” were
offered by the party who had drawn him in a Tatts’s
sweep. Whatever may have been the facts in this
particular case, it is certain that the policy of ex
acting sweep inducements from ticket-holders is as
rife as ever it was on the Australian turf or even
rifer. Practically it amounts to blackmail And
the scandal is the greater because it could’ be
easily prevented. In all instances where the sween
money is vastly bigger than the stake that the
horses are entered for, the drawing of the sween
should be delayed until the morning of the race as
with the “special” on Melbourne Cup. It i s ’the
sight of means to do the blackmail trick that makes
the blackmailing done.
“Sarto”: At a recent Albury (NSW)
race meeting, out of a field of eight, Heatherbov
Magic Ring and Fred Bluett came home in a bunch
in that order, with George Mac, close up, fourth
Amid howls from some and groans from others
George Mac’s number was hoisted, and the jockeys
weighed in. The puzzled judge inquired wherefore
the howls, and was told —in very forcible language
He ordered the number to be taken down ; but it was
pointed out that a decision cannot be altered after
the weighing in. So the number was rehoisted and
the flag flown, and the bookies howled that thev
would pay George Mac. The judge explained that
he mistook Heatherbov for George Mac, and ten-
dered the owner of the former his cheque for the
prize money, £2O. And General Opinion said he
was a sport. I contend the General was wrong—
utterly, hopelessly wrong—because the judge did not
tender me the 10s. I had legitimately won on
Ileatherboy. He did not even refund the bob I had
invested. Please lend me a few curses and also sav
whether this is a record or not. I hope it is a
record —it ought to be.
Some of the rising young bloods improved
their reputation in the Inter-State Tennis Tournament
at Melbourne last week, but, thusfar, no new plaver
has proved his Davis Cup quality. The best colts
are coming on, but they have not arrived. They
have still something to learn, and the nerve which
comes of experience is not yet strung to true cham-
pionship pitch.
Another old-time champion cashed-in last
week, when Mick Conlon, of the Glebe, Sydney, died,
aged 72. As a cricketer he made a name for himself
amongst the top-notchers, and, later, as a bowler,
was one of the Ma State’s best. A dozen years ago
he suffered a paralytic stroke, and thereafter one
of the most familiar figures on Sydney Cricket
Ground for half a century was missing.
The best English cricket XI that ever
could have been was voted on lately in London
Trutu. Instead of deciding the competition by a
majority vote, the paper referred the decision to one
expert. He remarked that it was not possible to
speak definitely, as many other names seemed about
as good ; but “with fear and trembling” he gave
the two-guinea prize to this list: Grace, A. G. Steel,
Fry, Jackson and Jessop ; Shrewsbury, Lohmann,
Lilley, Hirst, Peel and Richardson (Ranjitsinghi was
considered not available). To the average Aus-
tralian fancy, the claims of any one of another
dozen are as good: Maclaren, Hobbs, Hayward,
Rhodes, J. T. Brown, Albert Ward, Braund, Bosan-
quet, Barlow, Briggs, Stoddart and Lockwood.
The Wall auto-wheel, described at length
in this page some time ago, is now on the Sydney
market, Bennett and Barkell, Ltd., having secured
the agency. The claim of the auto-wheel is that it
is the ideal motor attachment for the ordinary
bicycle, which it converts into a motor-bike. The
extra wheel containing the power unit (engine, mag-
neto, carburetter, etc.) is clasped to the back-hub
axle and the back fork stays, yoked up with the
chain,/and the deed is done. It can be fixed or
detached with ease in about four minutes.

“Timber” Moore, of Melbourne, in his
day the most burnt-out man in Australia,
left a fortune of six figures, and his will,
read a week or two back, provides that in
the event of the reappearance of his eldest
son within a given term of years, the missing
heir is to take over the heavy end of the
swag. This recalls the mysterious disap-
pearance of young Moore some 10 years ago.
He dropped off the earth, and has never
since, been seen or heard of by his nearest
relatives. A headless body subsequently
found in Albert Park lagoon was supposed
to be that of the rich timber miller’s first-
born ; but Moore was not satisfied. Hence
the provision in his will for the long-lost
child.
Wyndham S. Heathcote, who holds the
Rationalists’ end up in the platform argu-
ments they have drawn the Church into, is
an Oxford man, who was formerly rector
of Bundaberg (Q.). He was a chaplain to
the forces during the S’African unpleasant-
ness. Thenceforward his views on most
things broadened. He threw himself into
the Labor movement in Queensland, and
only just missed selection in the plebiscite
to pick the Labor three for the Senate.
Simultaneously he cut from the Church, and
in these days, when he makes a crust as a
temporary clerk in a public office in Sydney,
he has more doubts than definite views on
most religious questions.


A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

400 ENTREE DISHES
With more t.n arrive regularly, was the order
given by our Managing • Director in Sheffield
some months ago.
WHY?
Well, we wanted to produce an “Fx & R” Entree
Dish of unparalleled value. We secured them
by allowing the manufacturer to make them in
siack time. Each has an extra weight of pure
silver on the finest quality nickel silver base.
The weight of silver deposit is four times more
than that on the Entree Dishes usually sold in
Australia. Then each one is hard soldered
throughout, and may be put into an oven. Most
entrees in Australia are only soft or pewter
soldered.
This “Fx & It” Entree Dish is the most wonder-
ful value we have ever produced.
Similar goods but with less silver have usually
been sold at 70/- each.

“Bilpa”: What devil is it that whispers
in the ear of hospital founders in Melbourne
and tells them where to drop their curing
chambers? There is scarcely one of the
places that isn’t an inferno of noise. The
Melbourne General is, perhaps, the worst of
the lot. Trams racket in front of it; trams
buzz on either side of it; infernal motor-
cycles explode all round it. St. Vincent’s,
in Victoria Parade, runs the General a close
second. It suffers from trams, too, re-
inforced by the howls of the dog-infested
streets of Fitzroy. The Children’s Hos-
pital, in Drummond-street, Carlton, is within
earshot of the State Parliament, and only
does as well as it does because the State
Parliament isn’t always in session. The
private hospitals are, as a rule, no better posi-
tioned.. Two are in the busiest lane
of the city, another in the street with the
heaviest rolling traffic. Speaking from per-
sonal experience, I can truthfully affirm that
my operation, serious though it was, didn’t
compare with the mental agony that I had
to endure from the noises that lasted from
dawn of day to midnight; and I took up my
boots and risked the promised relapse rather
than remain and chance murdering some
rather worse-than-usual noise-fiend.
“0.K.”: Why do Australians assist
theatrical managers in their practice of
making the arrival of his Ex. and party the
opening feature of an entertainment? G.-G.
or mere State Governor, it is all the same
to the showman and his paying customers.
An Ex. and party are the non-paying guests
who delay the rising of the curtain, as a
rule, by coming after eight, to the annoyance
of the impatient orchestra awaiting the
signal to start “Gorsave,” which is also the
signal for 2000 spiritless citizens to stand
up whilst “His Majesty’s representative”
poses in the vice-regal box. The King, ex-
cept on special occasions, tries to enter a
London theatre unnoticed, and take his seat
without disturbing the audience, but a vice-
regal person in Australia conspires with the
management to make his arrival an item in
the programme, and the audience parades its
perfervid “loyalty” by responding to the
blessed Anthem’s call. Furthermore, the
amphitheatre crowd has got into the way of
supplying a burst of applause when the
Anthem stops. Any supercilious new-chum
Britishers or foreigners in the theatre are
justified in sneering at the alleged democratic
sentiment of a people who behave like this.
It is only a little matter, but it helps in the
forming of national character. Even if it
didn’t, the writer, being quartered in Mel-
bourne, where there are usually two im-
ported figureheads, asks of the Lord of
Lords: “Is Thy servant a dog, that he
should be expected to get unon his hind legs
when Sir John Fuller follows him to a
theatre or concert hall?”
The huge Berry Estate at Coolant.,,
(N.S.W.) is being steadily reduced, no
doubt under the pressure of the graduated
land tax. It originally was a grant 0 f
10,000 acres made to Alexander Berry and
Edward Wollstonecraft by Governor Bris-
bane, the one condition attached being that
the grantees maintained 100 convicts on the
land. At that time each convict was cos"
ing the Government £l6 a head, so the
authorities considered they were making a
good largain, especially as the Surveyor
General (John Oxley) had reported that
the land was unsuitable for settlement
being too swampy for sheep. Berry and
his partner took possession of their mm
in May, 1822, kept their own counsel as
to the value of the land, and added all
the acres they could to their original gram
by purchase. They also did all thev could
to keep outsiders away, as the following
advertisement in the Sydney Gazettv
(Sept. 18. 1826) will show: “Messrs
Berry and Wollstonecraft, to obviate an
apparently prevalent mistake, do herebv
give notice that they have not opened a
public tavern at their dwelling at Shoal-
haven, and further, that they have no inten-
tion for the present of making it a house of
call for cattle-jobbers, land seekers or other
authorised bushrangers.”
Amongst historic spots thrown open for
public recreation is Brush Farm Park,
Eastwood (N.S.W.), the old home of
Gregory Blaxland. where the expedition
across the Blue Mountains was planned,
Gregory Blaxland came to Sydney in 1804,
settled on an estate called “The Brush.” not
far from the banks of the Parramatta River,
and died there in 1853. His eldest child,
Elizabeth, married Dr. Forster, of the 50th
Queen’s Own Regiment. After their return
from India (where their eldest son William,
well known later as Minister of the Crown
and Agent-General, was born) the Forsters
resided at Brush Farm, and there both Dr.
Forster and his son the Parliamentarian
died. The property passed into the hands
of John Bennett, of theatrical fame, who
let it to the Government as a home for boys
—the Carpentarian Home. The Government
resumed the property some time ago, and
now the grounds have been handed over to
trustees for public park purposes. On
Brush Farm is the grave of the notorious
George Barrington, who was buried there
over one hundred years ago. Until a few
years ago there was a rough fence around
the plot. Anropos the Blaxlands, the gate-
house of Newington Park, formerly the
home of John Blaxland. is still to be seen
on the Parramatta-road. The old residence,
with many additions, is now a home of rest
for ancient ladies.

would assist the Water Supply Com-
mission by making special provision
for storage on their own grants, there
would be no danger in case of drought.
“Part of the scheme should he the
formation of dams hy the farmers
themselves, so that the storage might

From London: Another “Royal Command” per-
formance in a London variety ’all—this time at
the Coliseum, the handsome and spacious house
bossed by Oswald Stoll, the ex-Melbourne boy. The
show was organised by the 70-year-old Bernhardt,
who has been giving half-hour selections from her
dramatic repertory there during the last six weeks.
Stoll erected a new and gorgeous Royal box for
the occasion, and George, Mary and their satellites
took possession of it at 8.30 on a Saturday night,
after having successfully dodged a contingent of
militant suffragettes in the lane outside. The house
was packed with nobles, Yankee millionaires and
gentlemen, and the three-hours’ performance yielded
£5OOO for division between the Charing Cross and
the London French hospitals. As for the show, the
ancient Ellen Terry, Henry Irving’s old-time leading
lady, started it by reciting some stilted verses
“appropriate to the occasion,” by Owen Seaman,
editor of Punch.
“Blue Mask”: Most of the imported entertainers
on the Brenan-Fuller circuit are from the Lnited
States. For several reasons. Firstly, the people who
pay the salaries reckon them more versatile than
English entertainers and brighter. Then, there is
considerable difference in the travelling—lB days
from ’Frisco as against six weeks from London ; and
fares about half as much. There’s another thing:
in the land of the free, four shows a
day (sometimes five), with Sunday thrown
in, is what lots of them have to sit down
on without a squeal; and when they strike Australia
where only one appearance nightly and two matinees
a week are required, they guess and calculate they’re
on holiday. Hence, they are always cheerfully ready
to go out of their way to convenience a perhaps
harassed manager. Of course, the same virtue is
found amngst the Britishers, but not so generally—
not nearly so generally.
“Cockaigne”: Someone makes a “Poverty Point”
par. about the Windsor Castle performances under
Victoria and Albert. Thespians were paid ridiculously
low salaries in that era-—as much too low as they
now are too high. Jimmy Rogers, a first-rate
London comedian, got £4 a week. Now he would
get £4O. Rogers took part in the last Windsor
performance, as it happened. Next morning he
attended the Bow-street Police Court, and said to
the presiding beak: “Your Worship, I wish to make
a donation to the poor box.” “Thanks, Mr. Rogers;
how much?” “Your Worship, I hand over the sum
of thirteen-and-fourpence, the joint contribution of
her Majesty Queen Victoria and James Rogers, come-
dian.” “What do you mean, sir?” “Well, it’s the
amount I obtained for acting at Windsor Castle last
night.” After that, no more Windsor perform-
ances.
“W.F.M.”: A Fitzroy (Melbourne) cobbler, to
attract custom in these days of high prices, notifies
that any man, woman or child bringing along a
pair of boots for repair will be given' a ticket for
a local picture-show. I can’t quite make out whether
it’s the boot-mending business that’s in a bad way
or the picture show industry that’s on the slump.
Redford, censor formerly of plays, and now of
films, has been talking about his high office. He
doesn’t like Scriptural subjects, but cannot well
object to them now Tree’s “Joseph” holds the regu-
lar stage; however, he is not going to let anybody
appear as Christ. Foreign films need most watch-
ing ; “the elimination of a few feet here and there
makes all the difference between an offensive and a
harmless picture.” It is not morality only that
has to be guarded, as a bullfight, for instance, has
to have a lot of gore cut out. On the other hand,
faddists write to him and denounce the awful cruelty
shown in (for instance) a fox-hunt. It was men-
tioned in the course of the interview that Britain
alone now employs in the film business 125,000
people, earning 12 millions a year.
“Baldy II.”: Theatrical choristers are having the
time of their lives in England. So man3 r of them
have been snapped up for the leg-revues at the
’alls that there is what is termed a “famine” in the
article, which perhaps supplies the real reason for
the slump in musical comedy. No musical comedy
can hope to run when it hasn’t a leg to stand on.
One curious result of this scarcity of limb is that
the latest samples of musical plays are quite artis-
tically compounded, the dramatic requirements of the
poor old “plot” having been attended to with sur-
prising success. For instance, there are no finales
in “The Laughing Husband,” which has recently
knocked London skyhigh. Act I. ends with three
people on the stage, and the curtain drops on the
second act with -one character holding the “situa-
tion,” which the chorus-lady has evidently lost.
What the next development will be no one knows,
but by latest reports the baldheads were just able to
sit up and take a little nourishment.
“Monkbarns”: Re ancient playbills. There is in
existence (I have seen it) one on satin of the very
first night at the Melbourne Theatre Royal, 1855;
it was treasured and handed down to posterity by
Charley Jutson, the box-keeper. The “School for
Scandal” was played with this cast: Sir Peter,
Rogers; Sir Oliver, Walsh; Charles, H. N. Warner;
Joseph, Burford; Crabtree, Phillips; Backbite,
Russell; Careless, Richardson ; Rowley. Salem; Trip,
Howden; Moses, McGowan; Snake, Bertram; Lady
Teazle, Mrs. Poole; Lady Sneerwell, Mrs. Moore;
Mrs. Candour, Mrs. Chester ; Maria, Mrs. Thom. Note
that there were no “Misses” in those days. Coppin’s
company, brought from Launceston to Melbourne in
1845, did not include one. Nowadays there are no
“Mrses.” —except a very rare Mrs. Brough. The
Melbourne Public Library has a playbill of the
farewell appearance of Mr. and Mrs. Coppin, in
1846, at the Queen’s Theatre. The programme in-
cluded “The Ambassador’s Lady,” “Four Sisters” and
“Turnpike Gate.”
Letters forwarded to J. D. Williams in America
have been re-addressed to a Sydney hotel, which
lends substance to the rumor that the picture man
is returning to Australia. J.D., on leaving, swore to
come back and introduce something staggering into
the film business here. A returned voyager relates
that, in America, he met a man who told Williams
that he was going to Australia. “Wa’ll,” said J.D.,
“keep your hands well in your pockets, my boy. If
you don’t, the people out there will sure crowd money
into ’em.”
“Private Boxer”: The much-coveted big advt. has
been achieved by the author of “Within the Law”
for his new play, “The Fight,” produced at the
Hudson Theatre, N’York. The piece dealt in bare-
knuckle fashion with the white-slave traffic, and one
scene in a Flossie establishment so shocked N’Yark
that summonses were issued by the chief magistrate
against the producer. It was decided to leave the
fate of the play to the grand jury, for whom a
special performance was given. Things there turned
out pretty right for the author. Bayard Veiller, as
they should for a man with such a front name ; the
offending scene bad merely to be cut out, and the
performances might continue. So “The Fight” is a
bigger boom than “Within the Law,” and Bayard’s
name is as familiar in the mouth as household bread.
The latest London revue scores heavily with a
scene in which Robert Hale, the most popular of
the younger comedians, delivers a Mark Antohy
oration while made up as Lloyd George. Thus:
“Rufus is an honorable man. So are they all, all
honorable men.” Also: “Friends, Romans, country-
men, lend me your shares. I come to gather taxes,
not to pay them.” And so on.
“The Merry Widow” has a natural pendant in
“The Laughing Husband,” just produced at the New
Theatre, London. The composer, Edmund Eysler, is
hailed by most of the critics as a second Oscar
Strauss. The German libretto has been cleverly
Englished, the unduly-sultry parts of the German
original' being skated over without disaster. Aus-
tralia’s old friend, Courtice Pounds, is the Husband.
“C. Ockney”: Gilbert Chesterton has broken out
in a fresh place—he has written something for the
stage, and it is to be put on at the Little Theatre,
in the Strand, where “Fanny’s First Play” com-
menced its phenomenal run. It is described as a
“fantastic comedy” in three acts and a prelude.
“Magic” is the title—probably chosen because London
managers have been asserting that it requires some-
thing of the sort to draw people to the theatre
nowadays.

Civilization stood aghast at the
news that three men held at bay for nearly
a week 2000 of the finest Police and Troops
of the World, right in the heart of London—
the greatest and most orderly City in the
World. These men were armed with
“Brownings”
and their marvellous powers were so dramati-
cally demonstrated that the World’s greatest
Governments were forced to take steps to
preserve law and order. * To-day, more
“Browning” Automatic Pistols are
in use by Government Troops and Police than
all the other makes put together.
If you want a Pistol for defence
or sport get a “Browning.” It will last
longer (10,000 shots have been fired from one
pistol without cleaning', is more accurate, and
far safer than any other Pocket Arm ever
invented.

The fast man
requires every assistance; he must not be handicapped
by a cramping or painful saddle. Thirty years’ experience
of his needs has developed our B 17 Champion, a saddle
carefully made to give absolute freedom and comfort.
We would specially point out the doming of the back
of the saddle, a feature commended by the leading
path riders as of great value for speed purposes.

EDISON
Diamond Point
Reproduc er
If you have an Amberola or any other type
of Edison Phonograph, excepting the Gem, or
if you are using Edison Blue Amberol
Records, you need a Diamond Point Repro-
ducer.
It will make the New Blue Amberol Records
sound clearer, sweeter and fuller. The
reproducer is the vital point of any Phono-
graph, for upon this delicate mechanism de-
pends to a large extent the tone quality of
all sound-reproducing instruments.
The introduction of the unbreakable Blue
Amberols has made possible the use of a
genuine diamond in place of the old sapphire
point. It is permanent, of course, and in-
destructible, and being round and highly
polished it will neither wear itself nor the
Blue Records. Every Phonograph or
Amberola owner should have an Edison Dia-
mond Point Reproducer. Call on your
nearest Edison dealer, or write direct to us
for full particulars.

Don’t hesitate—
get a bicycle built of
Genuine B.S.A. Fittings.
You will never have cause to regret it. It
may cost you a little more at first than a
“pattern” machine, but it will prove the
cheapest in the end.
You cannot afford to buy a cheap “pattern” machine—
you will be continually'" paying out for repairs, etc.,
and then have to “scrap” it, whereas with one built of
Genuine B.S.A. Fittings you will always have easy and
pleasant cycling, and yopr machine will fetch a good
price should you wish to dispose of it.

ACTD STOMACHS ARE DANGEROUS.
COMMON SENSE ADVICE BY A
DISTINGUISHED SPECIALIST.
“Acid” stomachs are dangerous because
a'cid irritates and inflames the delicate
lining of the stomach, thus hindering and
preventing the proper atcion of the
stomach, and leading to nine-tenths of the
cases of stomach trouble from which people
suffer. Medicines and medicinal treatments
are useless in such cases, for they leave the
source of the trouble, the acid in the
stomach , as dangerous as ever. The acid
must be neutralised, and its formation pre-
vented, and the best thing for this purpose
is half a teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia,
a simple antacid, taken in a little warm or
cold water after eating, which not only neu-
tralises the acid, but also prevents the
fermentation from which acidity is de-
veloped. Foods whieh ordinarily cause
greatest distress can be eaten with impunity
if the meal is followed with a little bisurated
magnesia, which can be obtained of any
chemist, and should always be kept handy.*

IN
BANANA LAND
At Beaconsfield Station, in Central
Queensland, where 21,000 sheep were shorn,
the lead was taken by Maurer, who Com-
peted with Zimmerle for the shearing cham-
pionship a few years ago. His best at
Beaconsfield was 216 in one day. At Cam-
oola Park, in the same neighborhood, Dan
Cooner, who put up a sensational tally some
years ago, was the ringer, with a top score
of 229.
“F. 8.”: High time some of the Labor
folk of Brisbane devoted a little attention
to the hours and conditions of nurses in the
Brisbane Hospital. A recent official state-
ment showed that nurses in that institution
averaged nine hours 50 minutes daily, or,
making allowance for holidays, nine hours
20 minutes. This in a city where no laborer
puts in over 48 hours per week, and where
labor unions seriously meditate a campaign
for a working week of 44 hours.
Bananaland’s Assembly has closed down
for the Christmas holidays. During the ses-
sion 30 bills went through. The only ones
of much importance were four Appropriation
Bills, entitling Denham to spend nearly
£6.000,000 when he can get it; the wobbly
Western Railway Bill, to allow a nebulous
line to wander all over Queensland’s back
yard ; an Elections Bill to disfranchise sus-
picious non-Liberals; a Pure Seeds Bill,
Denham being aware that various people in
the produce trade are (say) careless; and a
Cremation Bill for the benefit of the House
of Has Beens and Never Wases. An Increase
of Salary Bill was accidentally thrown out
through carelessness or a misunderstanding;
and a Separation Bill, ill prepared, was given
a severe knockout in the first round. A
necessary Sugar Cane Price Board Bill, on
which the Government was defeated by Labor !
plus Farmer, was jettisoned to prevent
encroachment on the holiday.
During Bananaland’s last session of Par-
liament Denham one morning was shocked
by some uncomplimentary things said about
his produce-agency. Then Brisbane’s Daily
Mail said much the same things without the
shelter of the Parliamentary roof, and that
last fact made all the difference. Denham
claimed £lO.OOO from the Mail to heal his
own and his firm’s injured reputation, and
was awarded £450, with Costs. Further-
more, he has been pursuing other rash re-
peaters of the libel with satisfactory finan-
cial results. All of which should help to-
wards buying him a new hat after he has
worn the old one out in passing it around in
front of all the Cohens of London.
It took seven days for Justice Chubb and
a jury of four to come to the conclusion that
Senator Ferricks had wantonly slandered
Premier Denham during the last Federal
elections. The case excited great public
interest, and political feeling ran high
throughout. It would be difficult to divorce
strong party coloring from any political
libel case in Queensland; and as no Labor
man has yet emerged scathless from such an
ordeal, even the most enthusiastic barracker
for Ferricks hardly dared hope that he would
break the record. And he didn’t, for despite
the able defence put up by barrister Ryan.
State Labor leader, the defendant was
“shopped” on every question submitted to the
jury, even on that of good faith, though the
reasoning of the jury on that head is mysti-
fying. Damages w T ere assessed at £3OO. An
appeal will, it is said, be made to the High
Court.
THE PINCH OF TOVENTY.
MARY JANE : “I can’t a-bear to look at it—ices
in, an’ me cove's outer a job!"
Not many of the present population of
Queensland Were there when the place was
christened ip 1859. But Mrs. Westaway,
who died a few days ago, landed in Brisbane
15 years before that, and lived there till the
awful climate out her off at the age of 90.
She was one of the first people to purchase
land from the Crown at Moreton Bay—a
matter of 70 years ago.
Bananaland’s Elections Bill has had one
of the stormiest passages on record. It was
introduced in July last, and it was not till
after 30 descents of the guillotine and 135
House divisions that it received its final
push. One shameless party clause is its
outstanding '■feature. Twelve! months’ resi-
dence in the State is the minimum qualifica-
tion for an elector, and two of them must be
spent in one electorate; and the absentee
vote is abolished. Thus the nomadic people
of Queensland —the people who are at the
back of the chief industries; shearers, shed
hands, canecutters, drovers, miners, timber-
getters, navvies, bridge carpenters, plate
layers, etc. —are disfranchised in droves. As
e whole, they give little support to the Lib-
eral party, and therefore obviously don’t de-
serv'd a vote. It is disreputable tricks like
this wholesale disfranchisement that make
men in other countries talk in explosives.
When an earnest citizen avid for reform is
refused the ballot, it is pretty certain that
sooner or later he will be driven to consider
the bullet.
Vice-President Roe told the Council of
Public Morality lately that there was not
one tittle of evidence in support of the ex-
istence of the White Slave traffic in Bris-
bane, and that “houses of ill-fame were being
harried and hunted” ; to which Dr. Jackson
added that they “moved from one suburb to
another.” Evidently the aim of some good
people is to make Flossie a perambulating
iniquity, so that all suburbs in turn may
know her imperfections.
Apropos of Denham’s visit to England,
such excursions on the part of Queensland
Premiers have usually been followed by a
change of political front. Byrnes came back
inclined to Liberalism after partaking of the
Socialistic Countess of Warwick’s hospital-
ity. Ividston turned Tory after his return.
Possibly Denham may come back wearing a
red tie and waving a suffragette’s banner.
By the death of Land Court Judge Scott
Queensland has lost a public servant of over
40 years’ standing, who broke all records as
the bond-slave of official routine and duty.
As Under-Secretary for Lands, Scott seemed
to have no existence outside his office, and
was often to be found there at seven in the
morning, and as late as II at night; his
only recreation was the teaching of a Sun-
day-school class out at Toowong. Able,
zealqus and upright, he inspired the public
with confidence ; but he paid for his devotion
to duty by an untimely departure at the age
of 56. His father, old John Scott, of Ips-
wich, passed out at 92; but no office ever
made a slave of him.
The Bananaland Government seems to be
hopelessly unable in these days to please
the Courier. E. J. Stevens, who sits on a
large chair in the Courier building and
squats like an Oriental potentate in the
House of Fossils, signalised the last week
of the session with a peppery speech about
the rulers in “the other place.” He de-
nounced them because they had wasted time
in sending along bills to the Council which
were out of touch with that ancient assem-
blage and had neglected legislation to make
that Chamber secure from the Labor inter-
ference which seems bound to come after the
next appeal to the country. Nothing could be
too Tory for Stevens ; the greatest reaction-
ary in the State could not introduce a
measure which would shock his soul. After
the attack aforesaid, the Courier talked
like a Dutch aunt to Digby Denham because
he was too slow in spreading out the State
Savings Bank, and had let the dreadful
Australian institution get such a start that
anything that might be done now would be
like sending out a mouse*-to catch a kan-
garoo.

BERNARD INGLEBY.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November 29, 1913
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
Governor Macgregor and family h nvo
been going to and fro in the midst of ™!
hot days and nights without any annajZ
fatigue. The Macgregor has been so E
battling with the horrors of more or W
tropical countries that, judging by the evi
dence of people who know nothing ahmn
those localities, he should have been dehili
tated beyond hope, if not dead, long
This afternoon he cheered up his countrv
men at the Highland sports gathering anri
cocked an alert ear to the bagpipes, almost
as if he appreciated its squeals. On the
previous evening the Government House
clan gathered at His Majesty’s and took »
helping of Bernard Shaw, who is a sort of
literary bagpipes.
Thank goodness, my dear, Rose Day is
over. It eventuated on Wednesday, and
although there was much more day than
rose about it, a handsome financial success
was achieved. The committee is jingling a
profit of over £TSO. The matinee at Hi s
Majesty’s was packed by a fashionable and
philanthropic -audience. Even the wealthy
classes were represented. I don’t know to
what height the profits would have climbed
if arrangements had been made to peddle
ice-creams and cold drinks during the after-
noon. Apparently nobody thought of it or
else sipping ices in a boiling theatre is so
sensible as to be considered plebeian in this
hamlet.
At the Mustard-Brennan wedding some
extra-glad rags were sported, and quite a
royal flavor w r as given to the function by
the appearance of the Cecil Palmer dame
in her Court-presentation costume. The
pageant took place at night. The wedding
veil was handed over for the occasion by
Mrs. Ned Tully, the orange-blossom wreath
was sent along by the Harry Mills lady,
and a wedding-spray was loaned by Mrs!
Cecil Palmer, who had exhibited it at her
own wedding.
The Ramsay-OTlagan knot was neatly
and securely tied on Wednesday. A feature
was the carrying by the lady principals of
huge ostrich feather fans in place of the
orthodox flower bouquets.
The brotherhood of the Queensland Turf
Club 'conducted a service on the racecourse
this afternoon, in the presence of a large
congregation. Quite a respectable percent-
age of the brethren and their parishioners
benefited considerably as a result of the
afternoon’s soul-stirring events, which in
eluded the Summer Cup. Amongst the
sistren was Irene Browne, who worshipped
(or rather, was worshipped) in a creation
of champagne voile and cream lace, ritb «n
Emerald and Oriental sash. Her halo was
of black tulle with awe-inspiring bows of
the same material. The E. K. Tully and
Cecil Palmer dames also deserve inspired
mention for their frocking. Others who at-
tended the service were the Dyson-Holland
ladv (who promenaded in a well-cut black
and white striped coat and skirt and a black
plumed hat), Marjorie Robertson (orna-
mented with a frock of cream silk-striped
tulle partially beaded in black and white)
and Jessie Clarke (in a white crepe foam
frock with wide flounce of lovely lace). Mrs.
Ted Holland’s black costume arranged with
white Irish crochet sent a few thrills
amongst the feminines.
The gallant Knight and his band of fol-
lowers are still engaged in the pleasant
occupation of separating Brisbane theatre-
goers from their spare cash. “Man and
Superman” was the pretext this week, and
on the first night a representative audience
woke up from its chronic lethargy and
loudly cheered the play and the players.
On Monday “Bella Donna” happens along,
and since the original scenery is reposing
blissfully in Maoriland. owing to the water-
side strikers there being adamant concern-
ing its removal, local painters have been
frantically slaving at new cloths. By the
way, Mrs. Brough will strengthen the co.
when it in Sydney. She will have
a strong part in “Diplomacy.”
The f@te epidemic is still raging, the out-
breaks to-day including one at Dutton Park,
to help along the Young Wimmen’s Liberal
Club, at present in its infancy. At Kan-
garoo Point the local R.C.’s were plagued
with hard cash, whilst at Auchenflower the
Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institute got all that
was coming to it.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

Hunyadi Janos
For an adjustment of the system, to dispel Kidney Trouble, medical men
from time immemorial have advocated the use of watery purging. One of
the best of all such agents is Hunyadi Janos Natural Aperient Water.
It ensures a prompt, copious, painless and easy evacuation of the intestines.
Hunyadi Janos neither depresses the patient nor sets up a state of after-
constipation, two points of the utmost importance in dealing with patients
suffering from kidney complaints, which sooner or later give rise to much
emaciation, anaemia, and general debility of body and mind.

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Rob II.: The yarn of the load of bricks
and the M.L. strike-picket has reached this office in
so many forms that The Bulletin begins to sus-
pect that the material was on the way to build the
house that Mrs. ’Arris lived in... .Shadforth: It is
piffle, of course. How could the Labor party abolish
the unnecessary second Chamber without sending to it
members pledged to vote for its abolition ?.. . .
Mabel: Anyhow, Adams won the prize. Presumably
that’s what he wrote for. Whether he would have
written in the same way if he or The Bulletin
were the judge is another matter altogether....
Piasaba: Thanks, anyhow.... Shareholder: The con-
cern seems to have fallen among a gang of thieves,
that’s all E.J.W.: Give us the title, and we’ll see
what we can do. ... J.A.L.: The fact that the Japs
were there has been often noted. They appear to now
stick closer to the coastal towns... . G.L.C.: Evi-
dently you just dash-off your stuff. When a sub-
editor strikes that sort of contribution he wonders
whether there’s an idea in it that shouts for pub-
licity. If he can’t hear the shout distinctly or is
extra-busy, over goes the lot in favor of the work of
somebody who hasn’t developed the just-dashed-off
habit Aliquis: If we told you the honest truth
about your verses you would arrest us for using
inflammatory language. .. .L.L.: lor the millionth
time, we can’t undertake to return the MS. of
unaccepted pars. Yours mostly lack Australian in-
terest. .. .Leo Lear: (1) Lone Hank and Mail
(Sydney), Australasian and Leader (Melb.) ; (2)
Brisbane office, 47 Adelaide-street; Melbourne office,
Clarke’s Buildings, 430 Bourke-street C.C.
(S.A.) : Verses strained and occasionally clumsy....
Mark C.: B-Grade verse O’P.: Confused item.
When the musical enthusiast tries to convey his
exquisite sentiments in mere words he seems to make
a discord. Either there is some quality in music too
elusive to be captured and yarded in language, or
else the musical writer is unable to definitely classify
his emotions E.D.S.: “If this is neither accepted
nor acknowledged in The Bulletin, of Thursday,
the 27 th, I am going to risk it elsewhere. ’ The
item came up for judgment on the date of expiry.
You may risk it elsewhere. ...Alan M.: Camp sketch
too young. .. .C.8.P.: “This is the first I have
written.” Then stop before the habit gets a hold
on you... .Joe R.: “Which undreamt of exists amid
is a dreadful line that would be fatal to any poem.
. ...R.N.: Nothing doing. .. .Alex S.: Not enough
bite in it J.M.G. (Q.) : Good central idea,
but treatment is not crisp enough. Try a local
weekly Ernest C. (S.A.) : Try to write more
clearly. At present your MS. is very difficult. Also,
give your verses a higher polish.... F. Jassey: We
want original jests. You seem to have just gathered
these up. The office boy could have done as much
with a shovel... .1.R.P.: O Lord, why don’t you
say something! Anyone can moan. . . .P.J.M. (V.):
Better bring that poem out in two volumes. . . .Roger
J,: You commit an aggravated assault on the English
language, and then ask us to tell you where you are
wrong. . . .Gilbert T.R.M.: There is some fatal influ-
ence about spacious sheets of foolscap. They seem
to induce longwindedness in writers... .A.M.D.:
Machine verse. . . .W.E.L.: Smoothly rhymed, but it
laeks force and directness, is clumsy in parts, and
too deadly serious everywhere. .. .Fledgling: Verse
all feathers. .'. .G.F. : The lines have no merit. You
couldn’t even hang yourself with them.... Doc (V.):
“My Queen” is too dull to read. She might pass if
heavily disguised with music. Almost anything will
go to music, if the music is good enough.... Glad I:
Story and verses rejected with profound respect....
J.W.T.: Very wild item without name or address
D. : A few £ood hugs in it, but the idea is old
and the treatment unskilful enough to make it slump.
Never cram your lines together, or you will be
cursed by the sub-editor and super-cursed by the
editor Bushman: Ballad not for mere print. It
is the sort of thing that requires a concertina and
a camp fire... .Frank R. M.: Sorry can’t use it.
Returning MS A.H.: “Phantom Fleet” scuttled.
P.L.G.: Unsuitable L.M. (Q.) : Try a re-
ligious paper —Sydney Watchman for preference....
E. (Tas.) : Yes, her eyes must be simply lovely.
But we don’t want your poem—d—d if we d 0....
John 0. M.: You don’t know how tired we are of
ling’ring mem’ries. We get about three quarts by
every mail, and they all linger terribly by dells, and
crannies, and weirs, and nooks. There’s a horrible
sameness about them all, and one day the man who
has to read them will drop his pen and steal away
uproariously to Mexico, there to forget amid the
crash of revolutions.... Douglas T.: Well written;
but incident too small. .. .Jane: Breaks no new
ground, and doesn’t break the old ground in a new
way.... Caius Marius: It read all right—until we
tried to make out what you were driving at
The Pessimist: This paper still loves the Labor party
—loves it so much that it wants the N.S.W. section
of it to go outside and cool off and get back to its
senses Harry B.: No room for large slabs from
English papers. No room for any slabs, in fact,
unless they have an Australian application Har-
borite: Neither of these; and we can’t undertake to
return MS. of unaccepted pars... .
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W.C.A.: Cartoon idea doesn’t appeal to u 5....
F. G. Tamworth: Good idea. Sorry too late.
“Chasuble”: Canon Nash is “coming
back,” as the athletes say. He has made
quite a hit with his Sunday afternoon ad-
dresses in the hall of the Melbourne Good
Young Men, and draws better than any
speaker they have ever had. Really he is
the finest preacher in Melbourne. Spurr
has, perhaps, the greater vogue ; he is flam-
boyant and rhetorical, and has Spurgeons
profusion. He is the polished diamond, hard
in brilliance, while Nash is locally unique
as the preacher of temperament, like Elea-
nora Duse on the stage contrasted with
Bernhardt.
“Billy Blue” : Another good story of Judge
Cheeke (N.S.W.) used to be told. 1869 was
known in sporting parlance as Warrior’s
year, inasmuch as Austin Saqui’s br. g. War-
rior then won the Melbourne Cup.
Saqui bought the horse from Louis
Ulide, the Sydney butcher, for whom
fie had won several races. Ted Lee,
the Crown Prosecutor, a brother of
the late George Lee, of Bathurst, had a mare
galled Phoebe in the race, and she got third.
Both these horses had a good following in
Sydney ; especially had Phoebe a strong can-
tingent of backers amongst the junior Bar,
who had got the “office” from the jovial Lee
that his mare was a trier and had a chance.
The day of the race Justice Cheeke was pre-
siding in a case, and a sportive young barris-
ter was busv cross-examining a witness,
when a tipstaff handed him a telegram. He
apologised to the Court for the delay, and,
opening the telegram, gasped to a long bunch
of juniors. “Warrior!” The Judge sternly
rebuked the counsel for conduct which in-
fringed the dignity of the Court. The bar-
rister at once offered profuse apology. The
Judge as profusely accented the apology, and
wound up with: “By the bye, Mr. did
your telegram mention what was placed.

The Inky Way.
Editor-proprietor Bonython early next month will
complete half a century on the Adelaide Advertiser,
which he joined at the age of 16. He claims to be
the only person now living who heard Adam Lindsay
Gordon, M.L.A., make his single long Parliamentary
speech. It was larded with Latin quotations, he
remembers.
The Inky Way in Sydney loses Thomas R. Royd-
house, who has been padding along it for about
quarter of a century. He commenced fingering a pen
on the provincial press of Maoriland; followed up
the practice on a metropolitan paper there i thence to
Sydney. In turn, he assisted the local Daily Tele-
graph and Melbourne Herald to make ends meet,
but the assistance was more or less brief. He
settled down to his long-distance job as editor of
Sydney’s Sunday Times, and now, after 20 years, he
has retired, to go farming in Maoriland.
* * * *
A sort of cyclone seems to have struck Sydney
Sunday Times lately and scattered the old familiar
staff. Murray, the sub, was blown up to Newcastle,
and apparently worried about things so much that
he overbalanced himself into a better world. That
excellent double in the musical and social phases
of the paper's work, James Donovan and May
Summerbelle, have gone; and now the news is
sprung that T. R. Roydhouse, the editor, has
resigned,
“Nemo”: I knew, for the greater part of his life,
George Vesey Allen, who died in the Melbourne Hos-
pital a week or so back, after a few hours illness —
internal haemorrhage. In one of the earliest years of
the 70’s of last century I was on the Melbourne
Herald’s reporting staff. A simple old gentleman,
a bricklayer by trade, named Forsyth had recently
bought the paper from David Syme, of the Age.
Allen’s father, who, I believe, had been a Govern-
ment official in Dublin, was the Herald’s “printer”
—the man in charge of the composing room. I don’t
think either the proprietor or the printer knew much
or anything about newspaper work. But they were
both of them straight and honest, and did their best.
I was present when Allen, senior, told the proprietor
he had a son who would be a useful young fellow in
the office, and, a few days later, G. V. Allen became
the junior reporter of the staff. He was little more
than a boy. His chief work was to spy shipping and
other things “posted” at the G.P.O. From that
humble position I saw Allen rise, years later, to be
chief of the reporting staff of the Age—-and he was,
for some time, my chief. He was not at all a bril-
liant man ; his writing was commonplace, but he
knew how things ought to be done, was a careful
manager, and had at his disposal a gravity of de-
meanor which gave him an air of importance that
impressed those who did not know him well. During
the latter years of his life he turned his attention to
commercial matters —a thing pressmen seldom do,
for, as a rule, they have no talent for business He
went into the exhibition line, and was successful in
starting and seeing through a number of .those big
advertisements. The old home of the Allens was a
picturesque bower in Albert-street, Fitzroy Gardens,
next door to the mansion of J. G. Francis. The
retired bricklaying gentleman who was G. A. Allen's
first boss was one of the first men in Melbourne to
strive to raise a Labor party, and it was intended
that the Herald should be its organ. The “party”
met periodically at the Belvedere Hotel, corner of
Brunswick-street and Victoria Parade, Fitzroy. They
were few in number, but far-sighted. They were the
coming Labor power, which was casting its shadow
before. But the wrong men had hold of Herald,
their organ. The editor was Dr. J. B. Hickson, a
homoeopathic physician, who could not have known
much more of newspaper work than the proprietor
and printer did. #
Left for his native Glasgie, per Medic, after 50
years of weary tramping along the Australian Inky
Way, George Cathcart Craig. He specialised in
many things, but never long enough to be a special-
ist in any of them. He ran a sugar paper in the
North, an agricultural paper in Victoria, a mining
paper at Broken Hill, a military paper somewhere
else, and of late years represented a leather-trade
paper in Svdney. A kindly, pottering old man, he
has left many" friends, and certainly no enemies,
behind' him in Australia. Craig, by the way, was
editing the Broken Hill Times when the Melbourne
mine-owning crowd decided to buy it and turn it
into the Broken Hill Argus ; and on the new staff
was an utterly irresponsible youngster named Ran-
dolph Bedford. So Bedford got his taste for mining
camps and mining.

John George Davies, of the Mercury, 10 years
Speaker of the Tas. House of Assembly, and 30 years
a member of that quaint little Chamber, was pro-
minent in the early cricket and volunteer history
of the isle, and could hold his end up in other wavs.
Once he fought a battle with Norman Cameron in
the Mercury backyard, and the oldest inhabitants
who remember the scrap aver that it was a great and
glorious “go” while it lasted, which was for five
rounds. The recently-from-Cambridge Cameron, fresh
from a Parisian boxing school, was the winner of
the argument. They say that the agile Cameron
“galvanicked” his more burly adversary—presumably
in the French style, which was foreign to John
George, who was intensely British.
“Bloggs” : Poor old Adams ! I see he has won the
£lOO given by Farmers’ for the best patriotic
anthem. 1 didn’t enter. for this competition, so I
may be suffered, perhaps, to speak frankly in this
matter without arousing suspicions of carking
jealousy. Within 24 hours fl write on the day the
verdict of the judges was made public) my luckless
friend will be the most bitterly execrated man in al
Suburbia. Already I see, in Fancy s eye, the local
versifiers flying at the throat of. his effort like so
many critical jaguars. To-night in 10,000 homes a
similar number of wives will ask their quailing hus-
bands why they didn’t pick up this childishly easy
money, the husbands will explain weakly that they
hadn’t time: that tliev forgot to dash off their
anthems till it was too late; and that. the Judges
in these affairs are invariably wanting in the flair
for true poetical merit. This will not satisfy the
wives and 20,000 or more smacked and severely-
shaken children will realise it before bedtime
arrives. For quite a week Adams, as an object
public detestation, will take rank with ex-Speaker
Willis And it will be months before he lives down
the rancor entirely,' For my part-andßpegg* a
T id before, entirely without bias—-1 question 11
his success is worth it-that is, unless he intends
to spend the monev on a long sea trip, in a ship
empty of Sydney passengers, and bound for some place
where they never read the N. papers.

was h about to make a highly important speech, this

“TFH”: An interesting “Advertising Exhibition”
has iust been opened here in London, and in connec-
tfon with it, to illustrate the size of the advertising
business, the fact is made known that one single
“publicity” agency in London one among scores
a staff of 70 artists and designers all the
™a r round. From the fine collection of old London
papers at this show, one sees how little the pioneers
nf the Inky Way bothered about advertisements or
news either. The Intelligencer of February 1,
1649 casually remarked: “There is little newes, only
the scaffold erected for the King.” Fancy a present-
day journalist putting the preparation for the execu-
tion of the King into a couple of lines 1

Airs. D. Blythe, 6 Marion Street, Caversham, Dunedin, N.Z. “Under troublesome
climate conditions, hot and cold, it has far exceeded my greatest expectations, as I

one trial will echo my praises of its virtues.
The REXONA HABIT.
A habit formed is

easily. The Rexona
habit results in health
and beauty, and once
formed will never be
broken.
There are two Rexona
habits—that of using
Rexona Ointment to
heal all injuries to the
skin, and the Rexona
Soap habit, which con-
sists of keeping oneself
clean and pure with a
delicately scented and
medicated soap. Rexona
Ointment and Rexona
Soap mean clean skin,

The Ever-Sweet-and-Scented
Lands.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEYOND the furthest terminus, and
far from road and rail;
Across the dimmest ridges, and re-
motely past the pale,
They lie, the summer-lands of youth, that
mystic sunsets gild—
The Ever-sweet-and-scented lands, where
dreams are all fulfilled.
The wheel-tracks long have faded out before
you strike the track ;
The trams and trains are left behind, the
cabs have all turned back ;
There’s none of these shall take you there,
nor any coach-and-four,
Nor any ship, by sail or steam, shall raise
its hidden shore !
No motor, though it gasp and spit, and rack
its petrol soul,
Shall climb the hills you’ll have to climb
before you reach your goal,
For any crank of human make that answers
steering-gear
May hoist you over half the world, but
never get you near.
The Ever-sweet-and-scented Lands know
nothing of the fires
That burn the busy hearts of men with
never-quelled desires ;
Nor are there farms to furnish stock and
fatten beasts for meat;
Nor sown and harvested for grain, that
many men may eat.
There are no laws of right and wrong to
aptly work awry ;
No fashions, politics or art; nor things to
sell and buy ;
Most deadly dull to narrow wits are these
sequestered ways ;
Most irksome to the worldly-wise the un-
eventful days.
{Bit hack in your upholstered ear and ivatch
the poles flit by;
The city lights are good to see against the
murky sky;
The roll of wheels, the flaunt of clothes, the
smart ex-change of views;
The waiters and the soft-goods shops; and
lots of noise and news!)
Ah, being in the thick of things, and having
all you need,
Races and Golf and Picture-Shows, you
are well off indeed !
And, anyhow, it matters not, though rich or
poor you be—
You’ll never reach the Summer Lands by
any land or sea.
For these, are walled with unseen walls
against all prying eyes;
Cut off. and unattainable, to all the worldly-
wise ;
No ticket ever bought bv cash will pass you
through the gate,
Nor birth, nor wealth, nor pride of place,
however long you wait.
Yes, some have open entry there, and wel-
come wide and vast,
And these are rich or poor by chance; of
every age and caste ;
And, anyhow, it matters not if high or low
they be,
They always reach the Summer Lands by
every shore and sea.
Ah. roses bursting from their buds, and
starlight in the glooms ;
Ah, limpid pools and winding streams, and
wide-expanding blooms ;
Ah, forest aisles, and mossy coigns, and
music in the shade;.
Fulfilling all idyllic loves, the dreams of
youth and maid.
For there the heart makes summer-sweets,
unmarred by harsh extremes.
And gentlest hopes are welcomed in with
all the noblest dreams ;
Yet wealth and power may climb in vain,
and pride must ever fail —
The Ever-sweet-and-scented Lands are quite
beyond the pale.
VICTORIA.
C. G. A. COLLES.
Guns for the Gulf.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
REAL, knock-me-down Persian Gulf
heat. The decks, even under the
awnings were cooking-hot, the metal-
work of the craft was untouchable, and the
charthouse, when I entered it, was like the
calidarium of a Turkish bath.
The skipper, in pyjamas, was lying back
in a rocker, with a big black Trichinopoly
in his mouth and a soda-syplion at his elbow.
He was a short, powerful man, light of hair
and blunt of feature, with small blue eyes
too near his nose and a clean-shaven face,
showing a hard lipless mouth. He called
himself Barker, and British, but I felt sure
he was neither the one nor the other, though
the trifling dilapidations in his English did
not enable me to “place” his nationality.
He pushed the cigar-box across. “Expected
a visit from you this morning,” he said.
“That so?* Then I suppose you can guess
what I’ve come about.”
“You want to know why we’re standing
over for the Persian side —isn’t that it?”
“Yes. Straker himself told me we were
to discharge machinery at El Katif. '
The skipper looked at me with a myster-
ious half-smile. “One of my owners, eh t
Know much about Burrock and Straker?”
I did —and not to their credit, either, but
this wasn’t the time to say things, so I in-
geniously combined a nod with a shake of the
head. Barker ruminated for half a minute
before he spoke again.
“You know the Gulf well, I’m told, so El
Katif could scarcely fail to strike you as a
very unlikely place for machinery to be con-
signed to.”
“Never believed a word of it!”
( Barker nodded, as a man unsurprised.
‘Well, what do you say to Kangun, on the
Laristan coast?”
I laughed. “Consuls at Kangun, I said
“ —two or three of them. I’ll bet my_ head
you’re not going there with your machinery,
as vou call it.”
The skipper bored a question into me with
little blue eyes.
“Well, perhaps you might call it machin-
ery of a sort,”. I admitted. “A rifle is, in a
sense, a machine. It’s an internal-combus-
tion engine, at all events.”
“You’ve struck it!” Barker said. “The
cases are full of rifles and cartridges, and
I m going to land them at Yesdir. Know the
place?”
“l'es. Quiet little spot on the inlet be-
hind lias Jabrin. And for whom are the
shooters intended, may I ask?”
I used the don’t-care-a-button tone, for I
had suddenly picked up a light upon the sub-
ject. Arms put ashore at El Katif would
have been for the use of the Arabs against
the Turks—none of my funeral. But weap-
ons landed at Yesdir would almost certainly
find their way through Persia and Afghanis-
tan to the hands of the fierce and unruly
tribes of the Indian North-Western Fron-
tier. Barker sat silent for a time, as if
gauging my credulity.
“Why, whom should they be for?” he said
then, in an amused tone. “For the Persians,
of course.”
( “Oh, well,” I said, as I lighted a cheroot,
I m not surprised that the Persians should
want to lay in a stock of up-to-date firearms.
The Russians have been butting in pretty
hard there lately.”
A flicker passed over the skipper’s face —-
a flicker that gave me at last his nationality,
lie was a Russian !
“Yes,” he answered demurely—though in-
ternally he must have been upon the broad
grin—“the Russians are a bad lot. They
require very close watching.”
“They do,” I said to myself—“and one of
them is going to get it, too!”
I stepped out of the chart-house and
mounted to the upper bridge. Here I found
the first mate, a mottle-faced and grizzle-
bearded Scotchman, who lost no time in in-
forming me, in answer to my first question,
that lie was “no’ a communicateeve pairson.”
The skipper, however, was taking no chances
in that direction, for almost immediately I
found him at my elbow.
“You understand the Laristan lingo, I’ve
been told. Is it Persian?”
“Half Persian, half Arabic, with a dash of
Armenia. Why do you ask?”
“Well. I might be troubling you, later on,
to do a little bit of interpreting for me. Have
you any objection?”
“Oh, no,” I said carelessly, “I’m at your
service to the best of my ability.”
I am as little given to deceit as may be,
but here was a case of fighting a man with
his own weapons, and I made up my mind
that if a little judicious mis-translation
would serve the purpose, those rifles should
never be handled by Afridi, Waziri or Swati.
Midnight. Free from the intolerable
tyranny of the sun, but sweltering, never-
theless. with the piled-up temperature of
the fiery hours of daylight. Heat-haze
blotted out the stars, and overhead all was
black, but below, though the Lancashire Lass
had been rung down to “slow.” a trail of
brilliant phosphorescence testified to her
progress through the oily sw T ell. as she stood
in to clear the southward-pointing headland
of Ras Jabrin, on which, though there was
no official light, three bright specks in an
equilateral triangle presented now what was
probably a private signal. The glow of the
binnacle-light showed me the skipper’s
grimly-set face, as he stood by the quarter-
master and gave him low-toned steering
directions.
“This Barker has the bearings at his
finger-ends,” I said to myself. “He’s evi-
dently been here before, and he’s expected
now.”
He was—by others than those he knew
of.
Away to starboard a shaft of intense
white light leaped suddenly forth and
pierced the blackness far to seaward. Then,
slowly and steadily, it worked back along
the water-surface, until, with intolerable
radiance, it took us into its ken, and we
knew that we stood out sharp to sight
within a magic circle of brilliance thrown
upon the sable curtain of the night.
The skipper didn’t take time even to
swear. “Full speed ahead !” he shouted to
the mate upon the bridge, and then, as the
gong clanged in the engine-room, he lugged
out a big army revolver. “Port —hard
a-port I” he snapped to the quartermaster,
and, in his impatience to help with the
wheel, he stuffed his shooter only half-way
back into his side-pocket. It was my
chance. I stepped quickly behind him and
grabbed the weapon, and when he whipped
round he found himself looking into the
muzzle.
“Game’s up !” I said briefly ; and, by the
ghostly radiance that still flooded us, he
saw that I meant shooting, if necessary.
Without a word he rushed away and up on
the bridge.
The vessel had now got into her stride,
and, under her ported helm, was sweeping
round in a wide curve to starboard, but as
soon as that curve had brought the merciless
searchlight nearly dead ahead to southward,
I took a hand.
“Now, my man —starboard again for all
you’re worth, till I tell you to steady.”
The poor quartermaster glimpsed the
levelled pistol with the tail of his eye,
and whirled over the wheel again until the
vessel —checked upon the starboard swing
that would have laid her head to seaward —-
was bearing straight down upon the light
that had never left us. Then the engines
were rung furiously off from the bridge, and
in half a minute the skipper was facing me
again—spluttering for words that would not
come.
“Don’t be a fool, Barkeroffski. or what-
ever it is,” I said. “You’re nailed ! No
guns for the Indian frontier this trip. I
knew there was a cruiser down at Naband,
but I never hoped she’d be here in the nick
of time. Some of your three-star friends
ashore have put you away beautifully.”
The man glared at me speechlessly for a
moment, then he turned frantically to his
two mates, who, with half a dozen of the
hands, had come up behind him.
“Seize! —seize !” was all he could get out.
“It’s no good, my lads,” I put in. “I
don’t believe any of you deck-hands were in
the know, but you’ve been caught gun-run-
ning, and there’s no get-away. That’s the
Astarte down there —two knots to our one.
And, even if we did try to run for it, a
couple of four-inch shells would knock us to
splinters.”

BARCOOROT 1
One of the Terrors of Out-back.
Indescribable Torture of Bursting Blisters and
Spreading Sores.—Other Ointments Prove Useless.
MR. H. McDIARMED, of 150 Nichol-
son Street. Abbotsford, Vic., says :
“ I contracted a terrible skin com-
plaint while employed in the grape-picking
industry in the Mildura district of Victoria. The
disease which is known as 1 Barcoo Rot," started in the
form of blisters, which appeared on the face and then
extended to the arms, finally spreading all over the
back. These blisters would burst and then form
into the shape of ringworms. The irritation nearly
drove me mad, and I felt I could tear myself to
pieces. It was torture indescribable, for I could
not obtain a moment's rest, and I became run-down
in health, and felt depressed and despondent. I
applied an ointment, but this only increased the
irritation and caused it to spread alarmingly, thus
adding to my misery.
“I was tortured in this way for six weeks. I
gave up the idea of ever getting well again, when
Zam-Buk was recommended to me. I promptly
discontinued the ordinary ointments, and com-
menced using Zam-Buk. Immediately Zam-Buk
was applied I felt its soothing effect, and the irri-
tation ceased. Other applications of this healing
balm brought a decided improvement in my con-
dition. It acted like a charm, and I could not
realise that I was fast getting better. After using Zam-Buk fora fortnight, the sores were
all healed, new skin formed, and I was completely cured. My skin was spotless, and, in
fact, I presented a better appearance than I did before I contracted this awful complaint.
My health is better in every w'ay, and I never felt more fit than I do at the present
time, which is entirely due to Zam-Buli”
w.
Mr. McDiarmed, ivho records his
experience, with Zam-Buk.
The Ever-Ready Soother & Healer.
DR.
ANDREW
WILSON,
the well-known medical writer and author of ‘ ‘Homely Talks
on First-Aidsays: “ Wherever a pot of Zam-Buk is
handy, this preparation may be upon as an antiseptic
dressing which requires no preparation , and has the addi-
tional advantage of possessing unique healing properties. ’

Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy.
This is the best medicine procurable for bowel complaint in all its forms. It
relieves pain in the stomach, dysentery, diarrhoea and colic. It has been the means
of saving more pain and suffering than any other known remedy. Thousands of
mothers in all parts of the world have given it to their children and now sing its
praises. This medicine is especially valuable in checking Diarrhoea which nearly
always attacks the babies when teething. One dose will relieve pains in the stomach
and it seldom takes more than three or four doses to stop a severe attack of Diarrhoea.
Always take Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy at the first unusual
looseness of the bowels. There is no class of ailments that attack the system quicker
than bowel complaints and when a medicine is wanted it is wanted quickly. What
has made Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy so popular is that the relief
is just as quick. It is a medicine that should be kept in the home at all times and we
advise you to procure a bottle at once, for it will save trouble later on and perhaps be
the means of saving a life.

also regulate the liver and bowels.
There was no need to say more, for the
cruiser had now ranged up to hailing-dis-
tance, and presently, “’Ship’s that?” came
hurtling across the water. .
I cut in upon the mate's hesitation. L.an-
cashire Lass,” I bawled. “Out of Liverpool,
with guns for the Afridis.”
Something like a gust of laughter came
from the cruiser, as, within half a cable s
length, she slewed round, reversed her en-
gines, and dropped an already-manned boat
from her quarter-davits. Presently, without
help of side-ladder, a clean-shaven young
second-lieutenant hopped on hoard, followed
by four of his men, wearing cutlasses and
grins. Grins, because they had caught my
hail, and suspected that we were merely
plaving a trick on the cruiser. The officer
looked round, spotted the skipper, and
walked up to him,
“I suppose you are merely having a game
with us, my friend. If so, you will find
that” .
The Russian spat furiously in his face.
The astonished young man stood statue-
like for a moment; then, with professional
imperturbability, took out his handkerchief,
wiped his face, and nodded to his men.
“Boat!” he said.
But it was not to be boat for the skipper.
As the men advanced he climbed upon the
rail. “I have spat upon the accursed Eng-
lish Navy!” he shouted —and sprang off.
We all rushed to the side, and somebody
flung a lifebuoy. But we saw nothing save
flashes of light beneath the surface, darting
swiftly towards a common centre.
“End of him!” said the laconic lieutenant.
“Sharks! Where’s the mate? I say —was
your skipper mad? What was that non-
sense he was trying to stuff into us about
guns for the Afridis?”
“’Twasna’ him that hailed ye. ’Twas that
paissenger-body, there.”
The luff turned sharply. “Passenger to
Yesdir? Bit odd, that, isn’t it?”
“Billy Oakes will not think it odd.”
This familiar reference to his commander
ralmost took- the luff’s breath away. He
saluted. “Very good, sir. If you know my
.chief, I’ve no doubt it’s all square. But,
; about these guns?”
“Oh, that’s all square, too. I’ve _ never
seen any of them, but that man who’s just
■drowned himself —if the sharks gave him the
(Chance—told me that the machinery-cases
,on the manifest were full of rifles and cart-
ridges—for the Persians.”
The lieutenant grinned. “Oh, of course —
for the Persians. Well, it’s not my busi-
ness just now to sample-up the cargo, but I
must get hold of her papers. Here, you, Mr.
Mate —get an anchor down. You’ll be here
till morning, at all events. Now for the
scribbles —which I expect are pretty
crooked.”
In three minutes he was back, with the
fiat case of ship’s papers under his arm
and a grim smile on his face. “Pretty much
as I expected,” he said. “Now. sir, we’ll get
on board.”
We got over to the Astarte, and the “pais-
senger-body” duly told his story to his old
acquaintance, Commander Oakes. Then the
papers were overhauled, and within twenty
minutes “Billy” himself was seeing the Lan-
cashire Lass’s cargo broached, with the ulti-
mate results that Burrock & Straker lost
a ship and the Gentlemen of the Hills
aforesaid had to remain minus 50,000
Mausers. 30,000 Lee-Enfields, and about
eight million cartridges.
ALEX. E. MONTGOMERY.
Her Appetite.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GLADYS is a substantial pink and
white girl with laughing blue eyes,
wavy brown hair, and a large mouth.
She was engaged stuffing expensive choco-
lates into it when George, her voluntary and
drivelling slave, introduced me, one spark-
ling afternoon, at Manly.
She nodded and smiled in the friendliest
way. “How-d’ye do?” she mumbled, her
.dimpled face working busily. “Have choc’ !”
she gurgled, holding out the box. When I
-declined with thanks, she sighed gratefully
and pushed another sweet between her pretty
red lips.
George watched her with fatuous delight.
“Do you like those, Kid?” he inquired
: anxiously. , ,
“IVyooful!” sighed his lady happily.
‘“Awflly good of you get them, dear.”
i Gladys has to sub-edit her conversation
severely in order to get through her eating.)
She peered into the box, now almost empty,
and gave a pretty start of dismay. “00, I
say' I’ve almost finished them already!”
Two irresistible blue eyes were turned re-
lentlessly on George. As,he blushed, she
laughed at him, showing milk-white teeth.
“Well, it’s all your fault, you silly boy! You
will go and buy me such lovely Ms, and I
never can carry them about without nib-
bling!” In a burst of bogus generosity she
offered him the box and the last lone lolly,
(George never by any chance eats sweets.)
“Now, this is for you, Mr. George ! Take it
at once!”
I had to wait and watch the pretty dis-
pute which followed. George, after a most
gallant defence, succeeded in getting her to
eat the murderously rich thing herself. She
shrugged her soft shoulders in a resigned
way, stuffed the lolly between her teeth, and
laughed again as she munched. After that
she played a while with the empty box —one
of the large, half-crown size—and chattered
inattentively with both of us. George
shifted his feet uneasily as the minutes and
the crowd went by. Suddenly his face
lighted up and he sprang to. his feet. “I’ll
go and get some fruit!” he cried. “No, don’t
you go, old man ! Stay here with Gladys.
What would you like, Kid? Some pears
or”-— —
“Oh, yes!” Her expression changed in-
stantly from polite boredom to eager, child-
ish delight. “Get some pears—and some
apples, too, dear! You know —those lovely
Ug ones!”
“Right-o! Back in a minute!’ He
hurried away in the direction of the shops
at breakneck speed, while his lady sat back
cosily in her hired canvas chair. “I’m
awfully fond of fruit,” she admitted.
“George always gets such heavenly fruit!”
A few observations of that sort filled in the
time until George got back, perspiring freely,
and indecently overladen with two immense
paper sacks of pears and apples. She
greeted him with suppressed cheers, and in-
stantly decided that it would be better to
shift round to one of the seats at Fairy
Bower. “You can eat round there,” she
announced. Then she laughingly abstracted
a pear from the bag to nibble on the way
round. The devoted George, his arms full of
vegetable nourishment, strode proudly at her
side.
Strolling round the sea-front in the oppo-
site direction, I presently encountered old
Captain Smithjones. He was trying to
make out the name of a small, north-bound
collier with his powerful pair of binoculars.
When he handed the glasses to me to have
a look, I swung round and patiently
searched the ocean beach until I found what
I wanted. Gladys, happy and comfortable,
was munching and swinging her feet, while
George, his straw hat shoved far back on
his head, and his bronzed face shining with
good nature, peeled the fruit with exquisite
care. An unlit cigarette hung between his
lips. Gladys as usual was doing all the eat-
ing. I gave the glasses back to the Captain
and pleased him by saying that I couldn’t
make out the name of the vessel either.
One hour later, as I made my way back
to the boarding-house, I saw George wor-
shipping her while she ate yeast buns in a
teashop. And late at night, after the closing
of the beach entertainers’ open-air show, I
detected them in the act of consuming oy-
sters. At least, Gladys was eating and
George was worshipping in the usual fatuous
fashion.
A whole fortnight went by (42 regular
■meals by food reckoning) before I encoun-
tered George again. It was just about sun-
down, and his aspect was fierce and despe-
rate. “I feel like shaking things up to-
night,” he growled. “What about going into
town? There’s nothing to do in this d —d
hole at night.”
I demurred weakly, but all my impromptu
objections were over ruled. He would not
allow me time to think until we were seated
on the deck of a Sydney-bound boat. We
smoked for a long time in silence. Then
George snarled fiercely, half to himself, “I'd
like to break the cow’s neck !”
“What’s up?”
“Up ! Why, this is the second night he’s
taken her out to dinner !”
“Oh, I seeT I thought copiously in-three
volumes, and then ventured to ask, “Who is
he?”
“That d —d little German snipe. Von
What’s-liis-name ! Fancy a girl like Gladys
standing that waster !. .. . Ah-h ! women
make me tired !”
I couldn’t pump up a satisfactory expres-
sion of sympathy, so smoked on in silence
and waited confidently for more.
“What I can’t understand,” continued
George, “what I can't understand is this.
She says she’s fond of me, and she won’t
let me' break off our friendship—says it
would ruin her life and all that sort of
d —d rot. Yet she cheerfully goes out to
dinner with that rotten little bounder! I
can’t understand it!” He bit savagely, on
his pipe-stem and looked miserably straight
out to sea. A minute’s hopeless gazing at
the blackness of the unlighted ocean, and he
turned to me quivering with dangerous rage.
“By G —d!” he hissed, and I saw his surf-
hardened muscles swell under his coat sleeve,
“if I thought that rotter had any sort of
hold over my Little Girl!” He broke
off wildly. Sweet, abundant Gladys is 12
stone if she’s an ounce; but that wouldn’t
deter George from calling her his Little Girl.
“I wonder what the devil she sees in
him?” he moaned, after another miserable
reverie. '
It took me some time to muster up suffi-
cient courage ; but I did it at last and waded
in. “George, did you ever notice how fond
most women are of food? It isn't exactly
greediness, you know : but they like the fuss
of dressing up and being waited on in public.
It’s a, sort of adventure to them.”
“I wasn’t talking about food, old man,”
said George sullenly. “What I want to
know is : What does my Little Girl see in a
hound like that?”
“Dashed if I know!” I replied. George
had rather irritated pie.
“No, nor I!” barked honest George. Then
he began again. “If I thought That Swine
had any sort of Hold over my. Little Girl,
I’d twist his blamed neck for him!”
We duly reached town and spent a mode-
rately dull night drinking. On the return
trip we encountered the homing Gladys and
her attendant Von What’s-his-name. Gladys
insisted on George coming and sitting beside
her; and she made him listen while she de-
lightedly recounted the dinner, course by
course. She thought in the innocence of her
digestion that she was giving him a treat,
and most reluctantly took leave of him at
Manly, where the miserable Von What’s-his-
name, in the most abject manner, claimed
the privilege of escorting his guest home
alone.
When his radiant and well-dined lady had
vanished, waving in the crowd, George
turned to me in a cold firry and spat words
through his set teeth. “My God! Didn't
she rub it in!” Then and there I resigned
George to his fate.
I saw thpm next day on the ocean beach.
The inevitable lover’s row had happened—
and concluded in the usual way. He wore
the aspect 'of - a well-thrashed hound, and
she, very well-fed and flushed, was graciously
accepting peanuts as he shelled them for her.
An empty chocolate box was under the seat,
and about a ton of muscatel grapes lay in
readiness by his side.
If simple George, who merely eats in
order to keep alive and well, would only take
her to a first-class cafe and treat her to one
of these three-volume meals that last all the
evening, I am quite sure she would agree to
eat before him for the rest of her life. But
George, apparently, does not realise the fact.
He keeps fooling about and plying her with
the mere trimmings of dessert, instead of
heroically assailing her with the whole ban-
quet. I am not sure that he might not
achieve his honorable purpose by suddenly
producing a round of beef and a loaf of
bread from his overcoat pocket some day
when they are alone together. But George
will never do it, unless someone prompts
him. Left to “himself, he will go on mechani-
cally giving her peanuts and ice-cream, fruit
and chocolates, until, in sheer desperation,
she attaches herself for ever to some wise
feeder who really understands the fun of
eating-.
