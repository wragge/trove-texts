Rudyard Kipling
It is many years since Rudyard Kipling
published his “Five Nations,” containing
some of his very best verses and a few of
his worst. Now, in The Years Between
(hjethuen, London), he gives us another col-
lection of odds and ends of verse, topical
jingle, pretentious and preachy rhetoric and
political special pleading, with just a gleam
of the old Kipling here and there. In verse
Rudyard was always rather an indifferent
craftsman, though on occasion he could rise
to the he'iglit of a splendid poem like
“Sussex”; but there was a rugged power, a
daring and a freshness about his work which
came near making him a great poet of the
people in spite of his obvious defects of ear
anl lack of feeling for the value of finer
Wo (Is. lie splashed on color with a stable-
broom, roared a hoarse chorus, and contrived
to get some real dramatic effects. There were
very many crudities, many lines with a limp,
much that resembled bombast, a good deal
that was suited only to the mood of flie
drunken professional soldier reared in the
slums; but over and above all this there was
so much that was strong and manly and in-
tensely human in his' work that it came as a
tonic after the rather anaemic verse which
had the chief vogue in the latter part of the
nineteenth century. We had much to thank
Kipling for. He got very close to us; he
"stirred something real within us; he called us
both to laughter and to tears. Something <>f
what Robert Burns did for Scotland he did
for the exiled Briton in Asia and elsewhere.
In verse, as in prose, he has a place apart;
and though it is by his prose that liis repu-
tation will mostly stand, it is his verse that
will be affectionately quoted.
But, accepting all this, Kipling would have
been particularly well advised had he burned
the “copy” of The Years Between before it
got into the printer’s hands. ' Many of the
things in the book would pass muster as
topical verse in the columns of an ordinary
English newspaper; but very few of them
are worth preserving in book form. In 1597
the “Recessional” won great public favor and
made Kipling thoroughly respectable in the
eyes of those who had been previously
shocked by the words of his blasphemous sol-
diers. Since then he has been trying very
hard to catch the same note; and in quite
half the present book the pursuit of the elu-
sive thing can be clearly seen. But Kipling
will never run his quarry down. About the
nearest lie can get to it is:—
Comfort, content, delight,
Tile ages’ slow-bought gain,
They shrivelled in night.
Only ourselves remain
To face the naked days
In silent fortitude
Through perils and dismays X;
Renewed and re-renewed.
Though all we made depart,
The' old Commandments stand:
“In patience keep your heart,
In strength lift up your hand.”
No great poetry that, nor any very stir-
ring appeal to the multitude. The “Female
of the Species,” which was written in 1911,
has been widely quoted, but it has nothing
really remarkable about it except the single
line oft repeated—
For the female of the ; species is more deadly than
the male.
All Kipling’s Tory prejudice finds full vent
in his verses on Ulster. Ireland is “Eng-
land’s oldest foe” and
We know the war prepared
On every peaceful home,
We know the hells declared
For such as serve not Rome.
After that utterly untrue apd foolish out-
burst of sectarian spleen the lines on the
“Irish Guards” ring with strange falsity:—
We’re not so old in the Army List,
But we’re not so new in the ring,
For we carried our packs' with Marshal Saxe
When Louis was our King.
But Douglas Haig’s our Marshal now
And we’re King George’s men,
And after one hundred and seventy years
We’re fighting for France again!
A curious business surely for the “oldest
foe” with whom the Ulster person is encour-
aged to have no truck !
But, of course, Kipling the politician was
always an absurdity—it is Kipling the singer
who must be judged. Take an example of his
mode of constructing a stanza
On the dawning of Easter Day
Comes Mary Magdalene;
But the stone was rolled away
And the body was not within—
(Within! Within!)
“Ah, who will answer my word?”
The broken mother prayed.
“They have taken away my Lord
And I know not where He is laid.”
Now apart from the fact that Mary Magda-
lene was not His mother, nor anybody else’s
mother as far as we know, how can her name
—with or without the pronunciation of the
final “e” —be made to rhyme with “within” ;
and what in the name of plain poetic decency
can be the force of putting “within” twice in
the brackets with two notes of exasperation?
Among the worst things in the book are
a long series of war epitaphs—clumsy stuff
which any verse-writer could improve on —
but bedrock seems to be reached in the cal-
amity entitled “The Craftsman” :
Once, after long-drawn revel at the Mermaid,
He to the overbearing Boanerges
Jonson, uttered (If half of it were liquor
Blessed be the vintage!)
Saying how, at an alehouse under Cotswold,
He had made sure of his very Cleopatra,
Drunk with enormous, salvation-contemning
Love for a tinker.
How, while he hid from Sir Thomas’s keepers,
Crouched in a ditch and drenched by the midnight
Dews, he had listened to gipsy Juliet
Rail at the dawning.
How at Bankside, a boy drowning kittens
Winced at the business; whereupon his sister
(Lady Macbeth, aged seven) thrust ’em under,
Sombrely scornful.
How on a Sabbath, hushed and compassionate—
She being known since her birth to the townsfolk—
Stratford dredged and delivered from Avon
Dripping Ophelia.
So, with a thin third finger marrying
Drop to wine-drop domed on the table,
Shaksjpeare opened his heart till sunrise
Entered to hear him.
London wakened and he, imperturbable,
Passed from waking to hurry after shadows....
Busied upon shows of no earthly importance?
Yes, but he knew it * .
After that the devout person considering
Rudyard and William in their ripe fame may
pray “Good Lord, deliver us” !
D. M. W.
From Villers to Victory
As the war spun out and the doings of
the Australians mounted up, Bean’s atten-
tion was turned more to the history that
the future would demand than to the
fugitive reports which the moment called
for. So F. M. Cutlack, a young journalist
from S. Australia, was sent to his aid; and
out. of the material he collected he has,
hurriedly knocked together The Australians:
Their Final Campaign, Iff 18 (Sampson)
Low, Marston and Co., London). It doesn’t
purport to be “history” : it- doesn’t attempt
to get things in perspective or weigh events;
it merely aims to follow the five divisions
through their almost, superhuman fighting
of 1918 and describe what the various
brigades and battalions did. It is not com-
plete even in that limited field. For while
Cutlack has 'been permitted —for the first
time in any published book-—to name Aus-
tralian brigades and battalions of infantry,
he has no data as to the work of particular
artillery or engineer units. Still, as far as it
goes, it will be welcomed 'as a close-up
picture in which at last we can recognise
the work of individual infantry units, even
though we are still not permitted to read the
names of their leaders.
The year opened with the five Australian
divisions working together for the first time
under one command. As in so many things,
Australia made no sort of bargain with
Britain. The Commonwealth was prepared
just to do what it was told, to take what
was given. Others, Canada, even Maoriland,
conducted the business on a more business-
like basis. There was the scandalous matter
of the hospitals, for instance: Australia
never had a general hospital in England, but
sick Diggers were scattered all over the
country, nursed for the most part by in-
experienced V.A.D.’s, while the trained Aus-
tralian sisters in the auxiliary hospitals got
mostly convalescents. Maoriland did not
make that blunder. So there is nothing to
be surprised at in the fact that not until
the beginning of 1918 did the G.0.C., A.1.F.,
dispose in battle of the whole Australian
army. in France. Until then the Third
Division, with a magnificent M.L. division
(Cutlack thinks it “probably the all-round
best and strongest division in the British
army”), worked with two Tommy divisions.
And, hardest of all, while the rest wore
their precious Aussie hats turned up at the
side, the Third Division till then had to
keep theirs turned down. The first three
months of the year were spent around Mes-
sines; and the Aussies kept themselves in
forpa by, incessant raids—a diversion in
which they were admittedly unexcelled, for
these were mostly a matter of initiative
and, as one general put it, damned impu-
dence. Then came the smash of the Fifth
Army—largely the combings of England,
left to hold too much line —and the rush of
the five divisions to help save Amiens.
France says they did it. Those who knew
them expected them to do it. Confident in
themselves, they had made the French vil-
lagers confident. But they had inspired more
than confidence :
The reception of the Australians by the local
population was unmistakable and made their return
to the Somme a high romance. Some of the Diggers
here found themselves known by name and remem-
bered like intimate friends. They had fought and
played, lived and died, about this countryside, not
merely as soldiers, but like patriots defending their
homes. To say that the French women and children
rejoiced to see them again is to report the fact
but mildly. As the Australian advance-guards
appeared many of these people, packing their old
waggons to flee, were suddenly seized with new
heart and a great emotion. They tore their house-
hold gods from off the carts again, and dragged
the old people and the youngest children to the
roadside to shout, “Vivmt tins Austmliens t”
This page trusts that it admires sufficiently
such feats of arms as the capture of Mont
Bt. Quentin and of Peronne. But when it
is asked what it is proudest of, it feels
inclined to quote this welcome back to the
bomme;
The interest of Cutlack’s book is
heightened by numerous plans of the dis-
position of divisions and brigades in various
engagements; and (three cheers) there is an

For Constipation
Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been
expelled from the body are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettes, the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do; and
they do not wear out in their effects.
Taken according to directions they
assist the patient so that the use of
an opening medicine is not a con-
stant necessity.

THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL.
Do not add to the trials of travel and of everyday life
by carrying a fountain pen that leaks—that cannot be
filled without a bulb filler.
There is a safer, better way-to carry an Onoto.
The Onoto is the British made fountain pen that
— p ills itself in a flash from any ink supply.
—That never leaks and spoils clothes and carpets.
—That gives writing satisfaction, gliding smoothly and
speedily over the paper.
—ls the only Self-Filling Pen in which Ink Pellets can be
used.
It is sold by all stationers, jewellers, stores, etc. And it is
worth many more times the price asked 17/-.
It is only common sense to discard obsolete pens and ways of
writing -to go to-day to the nearest stationer’s and say—“An
Onoto Pen, please.'

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Night.
A smoking, blood-red disc the dead sun sinks
tinder the round sea-rim.
Cool mists upcurl; gladly the parched land
drinks.
Blue skies grow faint and dim.
A vivid sundown merges into grey;
Scent-laden south winds blow ;
The nomad clouds of Jove, like birds of prey,
Devour the twilight glow.
Softly the gfacile gates of dusk swing wide ;
A lone star upward hies—
A beacon to the rest that, hastening, ride
Outward through pallid skies.
Soars, then aloft the moon, whose fire-motes
ring
The deep on every hand;
Like tresses on the bosom of a king
They stream across the land.
And down the firmament with footstep light,
Her eyes a-shine with mirth,
Wanders the Wonder Woman, star-cowled
Night,
To cast upon the earth.
The lotus-mist of dreams that lures again
Joys that old memories keep
But sadly: visions from the past that men
Draw back once more through sleep.

NIYA BECKE.
The Little Hours.
In the quiet little hours,
When the starlit dewdrops lay
On flower petals, while the flowers,
As it is their wont and way.
Sleeping, still, sweet odors shed,
I was thinking of the dead.
Somewhere in some ancient tale—-
Where, I know not —it is told
When the stars begin to pale
And the earth, grown grey and cold,
Turns upon its side and sighs,
Death moves darkly ’neath the skies.
Then, as though to comfort me,
Over hill and creek and rock,
Far and faint and eerily,
Came the crowing of a cock,
Telling all the sleeping land
That the dawn was nigh at hand.
Then I rose and, looking out,
Saw the darkness slowly die,
Things familiar all about
Taking shape before the eye,
And the miracle of Dawn-
Paling peaks of cloud withdrawn.
Watching thus, a hawk a-wing
Shot across the landscape dim,
And a stir, a-quickening,
Thrilled and rustled leaf and limb,
.And there rose a call of birds
And the lowing of far herds.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
By Day and Night.
Through all the day I walk with you
Down happy fields of fancies true.
Each thought, each dream of mine I close
About your spirit like a rose.
I open many an olden book
To read of singing branch and brook;
But dreams and dreamers slip away
Ar.d pass like some forgotten lay.
For always, through the music clear,
Above the flutes and pipes, I hear
That precious song you sang to me
Of our great love’s first melody.
Ah, Love, through cool, green days we go
Soul linked in soul by ways we know;
But when the night comes crooning sleep,
Eternal fears about me creep.
I lie awake and listen long
To your dear breathing’s sleepy song.
While all about me I can feel
A troop of old, old comrades steal.
They touch me with their tender hands.
Like leaves from far and dream-lorn lands,
As if to wake a long-lost string
Of golden-sweet imagining.
And as a harp my soul vibrates
Wild airs that throb with loves and hates,
With melodies no tongue can find
That sway to Memory’s every wind.
Ah, then I sink to some strange sleep
And seem with all those friends to keep
Above you, dreaming here of me.
A vigil of eternity.
N.s.w.
ZORA CROSS.
Anaesthetic.
The dark boat hides among the fogs
That guard the land of chloroform;
It rocks upon a soundless sea
Where very voiceless is the storm.
Oh, dark boat, do you wait for me
Beyond the mists of chloroform?
The dark boat carries shadowy things-
Odd perfumes and vague memories
From primitive, forgotten lives,
From undeveloped mysteries,
And some half-waking self that strives
Where grey oblivion waits to seize.
The dark boat will set sail at dawn —-
Will your thoughts tarry anxiously
About the spreading of its sail?
Will you. too. feel that soundless gale
That blows towards Eternity,
And wonder where it carries me?

HUDSON SUPER-SIX.
THE HUDSON SUPER-SIX is
* essentially a thoroughbred. Its record-
breaking successes following its advent
o o
electrified the automobile world. Never
before had a stock car performed like this
Car, and consistency was the keynote of its
accomplishments.
The superior quality of this Car compels a
price that removes it from the class of
popular-priced machines, yet the Super-Six
has sold in vast numbers in every community.
The irresistible appeal of the Car’s performance makes it
difficult for buyers to pass it by, with the result that every
day one sees the SUPER-SIX on the road in numbers never
before approached by any one large quality Car.
ESSEX.
CO those who do not know. let it first be
1 said that the ESSEX is manufactured
in the Hudson factory, which is an abundant
guarantee concerning its quality.
It is a small Four-cylinder Motor, with the
patented HUDSON power-producing,
counter-balanced crankshaft; developing over
fifty horse-power, though actually under
twenty taxable horse-power.
Its performance is hardly second to the Super-Six, and its
quality will delight the most exacting purchaser.
It admirably fills the want of a small quality-car with
delightful performance and low cost of upkeep.

WHAT IS FREEDOM?
For five years the British Empire has been
fighting in the name of Freedom; and now.-
the carnage being over, it is natural that
people should demand the prize for which
they sacrificed so much. There are many
conceptions of what it means. The bad
employer interprets it as a license to sweat;
the profiteer as a charter to rob the public;
and the malefactor at the other end of the
financial scale as a condition of affairs in
which it is possible to safely take the pro-
perty of others, and live, without working,
on the proceeds. None of these tendencies is
a new development of human nature; they
are to the fore now, as they have been after
all great wars, chiefly owing to the w-orking
of the old laxv that license comes after re-
straint. Also, there _ have been big
changes in the political outlook of
all parties. The pre-war Socialists clamored
for the State control of everything
as a means of dowering the down-trod-
den with liberty. The extremists among
their opponents —men like Bruce Smith —
opposed the State idea altogether; they con-
tended, as Spencer did 70 years ago, that
the State was going outside its province, and
defeating the operation of the law of natural
selection, when it interfered with the cult of
the individual even to the extent of regulating
industry (Early Closing and Arbitration
Acts) or. looking after the public health
(Notifiable Diseases Acts). After five years
of rigid State control, represented by an
idiotically maladministered War Precautions
Act, everyone is somewhat sick of the thing
—more especially those who in George
Reid’s declining political days were the
loudest barrackers for it. They argue that,
on investigation, Socialism has proved merely
to be the old arrangement, with a Govern-
ment official substituted for the private-enter-
prise employer —often to the detriment of
the person employed. As an alternative a
number of them are calling (always in the
sacred name of Freedom) for Revolution.
Anarchy, Soviets —a reversion to the tribal
system.
. * * * *
To accept the views of fluent illiterates
like the imported agitator Tom Walsh woo’d
be to credit the absurdity that the Soviet
principle is a wonderful new invention, guar-
anteed to supply the boon for which Man
has been struggling ever since the period
when the cream of the human race lived
apprehensively, as families, behind fortifica-
tions. To reject the philosophy on the ex-
position of which Mr. Walsh relies for a
more lucrative job than he ever achieved as
a worker, is to accept the principle that an
essential of real freedom is State control,
and plenty of it. Plainly there are many
activities in connection with which personal
freedom is impossible if popular freedom is
to exist. For example, the right to kill.
And there can be no freedom without security
as regards property, too. Liberty no more
exists in a city like Petrograd, where valu-
ables have to be hidden in the earth and foxl
and fuel guarded with machine-guns, than it
did in the parts of Belgium that were occu-
pied by the Germans. No one can be free
to spread disease, to stock his back yard with
high explosives or poison-gas, or to do a
thousand other things that might readily be
suggested, since all of them limit the freedom
of others. To go further, no one can be free
under modern conditions unless his country
is free. The Brotherhood of Man idealists
justify their call for disarmament and the
Soviet life on the theory which Cobden ad-
vanced in support of Freetrade—that the
other nations must see how beautiful it is
and follow suit. The other nations never do
in such circumstances. There is something
maleficent about our frail human nature
which impels the strong country to take it
out of the weak : it has not been otherwise
for five thousand years, and there are no
signs that the world has suddenly become
regenerate. Accordingly, to avoid an infi-
nitely worse enslavement than that of
“wagery,” Australia, like other countries
situated as it is, must have an army and a
navy. Many thousands of men in ships and
barracks are requirt d to give up a good deal
of their liberty—for liberty.
So it comes to this, that Freedom is not
to be attained by doing away with coercion ;
that there is a liberty which is really the
worst sort of thraldom; that the only
liberty worth having is not to be had ex-
cept by people who will submit in many
things to authority. The old tyrannies—of
Feudal lords, kings and the like—are gone;
no one’s freedom of movement is now in the
hands of some irresponsible neighboring
castle-owner. _ But there remains a tyranny
—an economic one —which civilisation has
itself created. All classes are enslaved, in
a sense, by the world’s new standards of
comfort and luxury. The poor man may
yearn to travel; he is chained by the leg,
unless he is a sailor, as securely as if he
was in gaol. Even the millionaire’s free-
dom is limited by the working-man’s willing-
ness to hew the coal and man the ships and
trains which carry the rich about the world.
Our modern reformers, dazzled by the work-
ing of the Soviet business in Russia, dis-
regard the fact that modern civilisation in
a country like Australia offers any thrifty
working-man more luxuries and freedom
than kings enjoyed when the world was more
or less as Russia is now; and. because all
cannot have the best, they yell for a suicidal
smashing up of everything. If they suc-
ceeded the capitalist would doubtless be
annoyed, but, as always, the greatest suf-
ferers would be the poor during the time of
famine and bloodshed spent by the nation
in getting back to normal and in setting
forth once more on the never-ending evolu-
tionary march.
* * r * *
If the Commonwealth estimates blitherers
of the Walsh brand at their right value it
will progress without any interlude of mur-
der and misery. We already have what
other countries had to go through agonies
to get, and in many cases have not yet
reached. If it were not for a leaven of bad
employers, and for the presence in our midst
of workers, many of them foreigners, who
favor a row at any price and will escape
in the event of its turning out unprofitable,
there would be no place at all here for Bol-
shevik propaganda. But that is not to say
that the country can proceed as though there
had been no war. The war has profoundly
changed the outlook of workers who have
never had any time for the insanities of the
Direct Actionists. To the best of the A.1.F.,
for example, it has given a new dignity,
added to a new determination to secure a
higher standard of life for themselves and
their dependants—in a word, more legiti-
mate freedom —than they had before. The
tendency has been recognised as reasonable
even in the R.N., which, up to the introduc-
tion of the Mate Scheme by Churchill,
was about the most Conservative institution
in the Empire; and it has been accepted as
regards the R.A.N. by the Navy Board in
the last few weeks. It is really a develop-
ment of the theory put forward in the
Whitley Report that the best way to run
any concern is to give all hands some say
in the control of it. In the R.A.N. the men’s
representatives will discuss, amongst other
things, living conditions, pay and promotion.
There is no legitimate private business of
any size in Australia wffiich could not safely,
even profitably, do as much; more especially
as the Australian employing and employed
classes are not, as Disraeli said the British
were, “two nations,” but citizens on very
much of an equality in the matters of in-
dependence and education. The scheme is
calculated to produce harmony between em-
ployees and employers—which is why the
professional agitators oppose it so fiercely;
it promises more productivity, without which
there cannot ]be permanent national freedom
for Australia; and it promises higher wages,
and to that extent increased personal free-
dom, for the workers. It is about the best
that offers in the way of liberty if it is
admitted that civilised man cannot be en-
tirely free —in the sense that a pariah dog
is free.
RAILWAYS.
Among the new crazy-quilt designs to be
drawn immediately with loan-money on the
map of N. S. Wales is a railway from
Griffith to Hillston (461 miles). There is
nothing unusual about it, but it is a sample.
Griffith is 394 miles from Sydney, so Hillston
will be 4401 miles. Hillston, the terminus
of the line that is to be, held 641 people
at last stock-taking, though in 1891 it con-
tained as many as 734. Griffith, 'the present
terminus, is too new to have had a human
stocktaking. Barellan, the town further
back, which was the terminus eight
years before the track moved on to Griffith,
is credited with 295 persons. Griffith _ is
understood to support a mixed train thrice
a week. Or, rather, it doesn’t even pretend
to support its mixed train. The section of
the line from Temora to Barellan (62 miles)
at latest advices paid working expenses and
a trifle towards the interest bill. The loss
for the year was £3164, which was made
good by increasing the taxes. The section
between Barellan and Griffith (33 miles),
being further out, doesn’t even pay working
expenses, let alone interest. The year’s
takings were £2604, and the outgoings
£9B97—loss, £7293. The deficit was
made good by increasing the taxes. Takings
averaged ss. per mile per day. The ex-
tension to Hillston, that place being still
further out, is expected to pay worse, but
the taxes can always be increased. Hillston
is on the Lachlan, far beyond the most
sanguine wheat-growing limit which the
N.S.W. Statistician has marked on his map
—the limit of 1912, when N. S. Wales felt
good and was busy planting a
crop. It is in the county of Nicholson, where
the population is about half a human to the
square mile, and has been decreasing for at
least 20 years. There is plenty of hope for
any line which is on the road to some-
where and is unprofitable only because it
hasn’t yet got there, but for the non-paying
line that is on the road to nowhere hope is
extinct. Hillston is a milepost on the path
to nowhere —except itself. The Lachlan,
needless to say, isn’t navigable in any sense
worth mentioning like the Murray, though
eels of light draught get along there. Nor
is it capable of supplying power like the
Snowy. So far from having nower to spare
it can hardly get along itself unless it is
pushed. The country .thereabouts has
neither iron, coal nor other known minerals,
and it is scarce of timber and sparse of
rain. It is a very moderate cattle and sheep
district, and the prospects thereabouts of a
dead-end railway to a dead-end town, are
limited.
# » * *
In addition to its own drawbacks the
Barellun-Griffitli-llillston line is one of quite
a number running almost parallel and at
close range across the bare plains. One
points to Broken Hill and Adelaide; the
rest simply to nude spots on the plains. The
Hay enterprise was built to open the in-
terior, develop its great natural resources
and bring population. Hay, at last census,
just like Hillston, had a smaller population
than in 1891 (2461, as against 2741). It
is, as already hinted, 466 miles from Sydney,
and its iron highway been working for
37 years, yet most years it doesn’t pay
working exnenses. The interest bill is met
by increasing taxation. The neighboring
line to Cargellico, of which the final instal-
ment (71 miles) is fairly new, doesn’t pay
working expenses either. The balance of
the working expenses and the whole of the
interest are met in the regular way. For
the line that is stretching out from Con-
dobolin towards the Darling there are no
returns yet. The one from Narrandera to
Finley, opened 21 years ago, is among those
that cover working expenses and a fragment
of the interest bill, so it is better than some:
but the bulk of the interest comes out of
taxes, as usual. In this drought-afflicted
section, mostly beyond the agricultural belt,
the passion to build new loan railways is
making the map look like a drunken grid-
iron, and the passion diminishes not even
though the old loan lines have been showiug
disastrous results for as much as 37 years,
and have, in most cases, only led to loss of
population.
* # * *
Railways, it is understood, must be built
somewhere, even if they yield less than
nothing and lead nowhere, and though the
result is a diminution of population, and the
country has to be taxed and extra-taxed and
super-taxed to keep them going, as if they
were bishops or royal palaces. They must
be built, even without purpose or hope or
object, because any dolt-in-office can find
work for the people that way and so post-
pone brain-racking industrial problems. Also
it is a fashion to “develop the great natural
resources of the country” that way, and a
dolt-in-office who didn’t follow the tradition
would be out of order. Also he would be
out of office. But it is a fixed rule that
lines must not be built so that they will
assemble population at any part of the well-
watered coastland near a feasible deep-sea
port, because that port might become in-
flated, and refuse to be obliterated in the
interests of the Great Congestion Monopoly
of Sydney. Thus there might arise com-
peting sea-coast cities, which is the recognised
thing in Britain, where the idea of a Lon-
don shipping monopoly is never dreamed of,
but is held by the Australian Congesters to
be unthinkable. And these ports, if too
much repressed, might follow the shocking
and never-to-be-forgotten examples of Bris-
bane and Melbourne and set up as State
capitals on their own, to the diminution of
the importance of the people in office. Thus
Port Stephens and Eden can’t get railways,
though lines leading that way would be
lines to somewhere, while any long streak
of misery in the dry West that has been a
drag on the taxpayer for 37 years is liable
to be extended to still worse regions m
order to keep up the fiction of briskness and
progress. After the regions which are
blessed with a rainfall and a future—regions
the development of which might raise up
rival ports—have been eliminated, there are
very few save hopeless ones where a brisk
Congestive borrower and developer can get
to work on a big scale. At the date of
the last N.S.W. railway report (June, 1918)
the State possessed 2800 miles of railway
(out of 4679 miles! which didn’t pay work-
ing expenses and interest, and 420 miles of
this didn’t pay working expenses let alone
interest. And enterprises of this sort grow
more numerous. During 1917 and 1918
there appeared for the first time in the
railway accounts 664 miles of new line which
failed to pay working charges and interest
(deficit £144,879) ; and of this lot 193 miles
was of the kind that didn’t cover expenses
to say nothing of interest. As this species
of line grows old and a big repair bill
attaches to it, the position may grow wore 1
Unpayable lines may be necessary just as
the wages of soldiers are necessary. But
they should be paid for strictly out of
revenue. To invest the children’s money in
them (and leaving the bill to the children
is the same thing) and pass to the young
generation a bogus mortgage as an inherit-
ance is the act of a fraudulent trustee. It
is a robbery of the fatherless, for the new
generation will be fatherless by the time it
is old enough to realise the full enormity
of the swindle, and then it will be sorry
it spent so much on the old man’s funeral.
PROTECTION, AND WHEAT AT
9s. 2d. PER BUSHEL.
In the United States the price to the farmer
of the coming wheat crop has been fixed at
9s. 2d. per bushel, and the export of wheat
and flour except by Government permission
has been prohibited. Also importation has
been prohibited—not limited by a duty, bur
shut down on as a crime. That is the end
of Australia’s hope of finding a fine, large
market in the United States for the pro-
duct it most wants to get rid of. In the
rare event of a shortage in Uncle Sam’s
country, a hard official bargain may be made
for some Australian wheat, but this country
won’t be allowed to rush promiscuously into
the market and take the best advantage of
famine prices. The event should also be the
end of the folly of sending persons like H. Y.
Braddon across the water to be beguiled
with lunches tendered by plausible individ-
uals who want the free run of this country
for all their gimeracks and “notions,” but
offer nothing practical save contumely in
return—the individuals who rigidly prohibit
trusts in their own land as being injurious,
but give special legal facilities for the for-
mation of trusts to operate in Australia and
other silly, harmless places.
* * * »
Over the wheat matter the policy of the
U S. is exactly the one which The Bulletin
has urged Australia to follow, and which it
must follow unless its wheat-farmer, except
in favored spots, is to sink to very near the
level of the Indian peasant or the Russian
moujik, who also grow for the world’s mar-
kets and compete with him there on level
terms—or rather better terms, having less
freight to pay. Uncle works on these defined
principles:—
To dot his country with manufacturing towns, so
that the people who make his clothes and machinery
may be under his own control and pay taxes to him
and not to some European Government.
To sell these persons his wheat on the spot at a
price which will enable his farmer to live, instead
of selling it to, them in Europe, and having one-
quarter of the export c op swallowed in middlemen’s
charges, and having his returns fixed by the prices
in European markets, which prices are the lowest
that the gang of international thieves can arrange.
The Yankee person had practically gone out
of th-e wheat export business in 1914. He
went into it again during the war because
the Government seized the crop, allotted an
immense proportion of it for export in order
to help the Allies (and incidentally to make
a heap of money in a famine-stricken mar-
ket.), and bade the nation scramble along
with what was left. The rush caused a
great new area to be sown; but, all the same,
Uncle doesn’t intend to remain in the export
business. He would rather be a trifle short,
and have to import occasionally under strict
Government supervision, than have a huge
surplus to sell at bargain sale prices abroad,
and have local prices and the local farmer’s
wages fixed to correspond. The cheap loaf
is a fine thing to talk about. But if it be-
comes so cheap that the farmer is a degraded
pauper and a danger to the community, or
so .low that !he throws up the business and
becomes part of an unemployed mob which
has to be provided for by setting it to build
loan railways in a wilderness, the cheap loaf
costs too much.
* * * *
Wheat-growers and plumbers and brick-
layers and wharf-laborers at starvation
wages are all part of the same evil. The
Freetrader, speaking for hire or talking gratis
out of the depths of his own incapacity, is
addicted to telling the farmer that there is no-
thing for him in Protection—that it is merely
a device for the benefit of the manufacturer
and the artisan. What Protection has for
the Yankee farmer this year is a guaranteed
9s. 2d. per bushel because it has given him a
local market for his produce, and the price
in that local market can be fixed like any
other minimum wage. Our position is about
this: —
Australia has an absurdly large proportion of its
people on the land, conside ing how few are this
country’s agricultural products at present.
It has too small a proportion of its people on
the land, seeing that it doesn’t grow its own cotton
or flax or sufficient of its own sugar.
It has a ridiculously small proportion of its people
in towns.
It has an insanely large proportion in a few ex-
traordinarily big towns.
And all these are symptoms of the low-tariff
and high importing condition of things which
made the Australian farmer sky his old bat-
tered hat in joy when he heard that a big
sale of belated wheat had been effected for
foreign markets at 4s. 44d. per bushel.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Getting Along Without Freetrade.
The rage of the Freetrader when he hears
that an Australian factory industry shows
signs of progress under Protection is worse
than that of the old-time inquisitor when he
smelled a heretic. Thus A. G. lluie, _of
Sydney, wrote in great anger to the morning
press the other day, and was backed up in
the Telegraph, because an order for 100.000
pairs of boots for England had been placed
here. The idea that Australia should be
able to sell boots, instead of buying them
abroad while its own bootmakers were out of
work and living on loans, struck Huie and
the Telegraph as insufferable, and they


both demanded the abolition of the Protec-
tive duty which had helped to bring the
beastly thing about. Boots (apart from
gum-boots, which are free) are among the
feAv articles which enjoy a decent measure of
Protection—4o and 35 per cent. It might
reasonably be more, for the difference of
AA r ages and hours as compared with some of
competitors is equal to 50 per cent; but
it is much better than nothing. Helped by
the tariff as a steady thing, with the war as
a casual aid, the Australian boot industry
has made some progress as follows: —
Boot Trade Put Into Money.
Money Wasted
to Help Foreign
and Damage
Imports. Exports. Local Industry.
1913 .. £064.709 £18,079 £046,630
1914- 624.265 23,196 601,069
1915- 380,619 34,882 345,737
1916- 448,962 68,900 380,062
1917- 239,801 154,740 85,061
The good work isn’t nearly finished yet, for
a_ country Avhich grows in great plenty the
hides for the boots and laces and the iron
for the metal-Avork, should - not only supply
itself, but have a big surplus for export.
It should sell boots instead of hides. But
there is great progress. The industry has
indeed begun to show the familiar signs
which have characterised protected industries
in Germany, the U.S., Canada and other
countries. With the local market to some
extent secured so that the manufacturer can
get to steady work, instead of having only
the leaA’ings of the trade and being struck
by periodical attacks of dumping, production
becomes so much cheaper that it is possible
to compete occasionally with certain lines
in foreign markets. It was this position, as
shown by a foreign military order for 100,000
pairs of boots in one line, that drove Huie
and the Telegraph to their frantic demand
that the duty should be abolished to prevent
such a thing happening again. The local boot
business had begun to show that it could get
along without Freetrade, and the enraged
Freetrader desired that it should have Free-
trade immediately to prevent it getting along.
♦
Austria.
Austria supplies the most decisive instance
in history of the broken old man going back
to the broken old selection. It was originally
German, and its Government was always
German, and when the non-German parts
are taken away there isn’t enough left of
the second-biggest empire in Europe to make
half of Tasmania. It isn’t a case of con-
fiscation, but merely of freeing the annexed
alien, peoples who wanted to be free. It is
a supreme marvel hoiv such a small robber
managed to steal so much. An ant getting
away with a terrace of houses would be a
parallel. Of course the robbed spoke differ-
ent languages. There was no cohesion among
them and no rallying-point. They were em-
ployed against each other. In fact, towards
the end two sets of them, the Magyars and
the Austrian Poles, were taken into partner-
ship and mollified by being allowed to be
beastly to their smaller neighbors. There
must have been remarkable statesmanship
of a sort, for the Austrian never made a
friend in his life, yet none of his oppressed
subjects ever got away from him except with
outside assistance. The battle of liberty was
fought often enough,, but as usual it didn’t
pan out worth a cent.. Freedom shrieked
when Kosciusko fell, but did nothing else;
and it would still be making the same noise
at the same address if the jug of ambition
hadn’t gone to the well once too often. Over
600 years ago the speck called Austria left
its humble shack to found an empire, and
it stuck at the job persistently. The last
brick of the structure was laid as late as
1908, when nearly 20,000 square miles of
country and nearly 2,000,000 strange people
were roped in. Then there was the reach-
out for another brick (Serbia) ; but the
bricklayer overbalanced, and all the fruits
of over 600 years of buccaneering went at
once. Spain and Portugal and France and
Holland lost great colonies, but the mother-
country remained. Austria has lost most of
what it had come to regard as the mother-
country, and its collapse suggests the British
Empire being reduced to Alfred’s old king-
dom of Wessex. Now it makes a fresh start,
as Rome did. Rome, having gained 1350 years’
experience, and lost a property which once
extended from Scotland to Persia, valiantly
resumed its old job as a city State with a
few paddocks attached, and in the course
of another 1300 years it has risen to be
at least a Power. It developed from office-
boy to Vanderbilt. Then it got back to
being office-boy again, and having by rare
good fortune gone into the Church when
the collections were good, it has so far re-
trieved its fortunes that it is noiv manager
of a branch office. Babylon hasn’t had the
same luck, but there was no church for it
to go into. In fact, Rome is the only re-
liable example of a very great State which
appeared a second time on earth, and if it
hadn’t had the wonderful chance to come
back in a religious capacity it might have
been carried away for building material. It
isn’t at all likely that Austria will revive
in the same fashion. It never had any con-
stitution to speak of in its big days, like
Spain and France. Having been an ordinary
sort of peasant, and then a dissipated peer
who never quite fitted into his surroundings,
it has probably gone back to the old selec-
tion for good. Possibly it may get tired of
the. egg-and-bacon life and hire itself out as
a flunkey in the halls of its reduced but still
imposing neighbor.

Walsh, Filibuster.
The adventurer’s craving to go forth and
“carve out” (i.e.. steal with fire and sword)
a principality for himself never dies. In
and around the Crusading days all sorts of
adventurers with little money, a little cheap
gentility, a coat of mail and a cloak of
matchless effrontery Ayent out and became
rulers. They dotted themselves all over the
city-States of Italy. They held Sicily and
Naples for many years. They were poten-
tates in the Holy Land. And for a while
they divided the Greek Empire in Europe.
In later times squalid German princelings
with morganatic mothers have been in-
stalled in all manner of places, and there
seemed no end to the game till sub-lieutenant
William of Wied made it ridiculous. Le-
baudy, the “Emperor of the Sahara,” and
William Walker, the self-made President
and self-appointed regenerator of Nicaragua,
were of the same filibuster type. It is a
long ery from William the Conqueror to
William Walker and William of Wied,
but the type is the same, though the success
is different. The latest incipient autocrat
is named Thomas, and he has marked out
Australia for his'kingdom. Thomas Walsh
has imported himself to this country to
bestow on it his patronage, condescension
and instruction, to regenerate it, and to
teach the uncultured aborigines the true
road to freedom. In this respect he is akin
to William of Wied and Walker of Nica-
ragua. He has all the monstrous self-con-
fidence of the missionary shedding fresh in-
formation on the unclothed autochthon, and
telling him that two and two make four.
Just before going to gaol on a three months’
sentence, with the assurance that even in
gaol he would keep the industry of his neiv
principality suspended at his pleasure, he fur-
nished details of the new GoAmrnment which
he, Thomas, proposes to bestow. It will be
a Soviet arrangement on the Russian plan—
an administration by local councils com-
posed of manual laborers with everybody
else excluded ; a central Soviet of the same
type, and an official head of the Lenin or
Trotsky or Bela Kun order. Of course
the official head could be none other than
Walsh, for the man who creates a new
Government is naturally its chief. There
might be no great and definite title attached
to the position, but Avlien the reality of
power is there a title doesn’t signify—for a
while, anyhow. Julius Ctesar struggled
along without one, and so did Robespierre.
There would be bloodshed, of course. When
one-third of the people assume the power
that used to belong to the whole, the other
two-thirds is bound to fight, for its life as
Avell as its liberty is at stake. Even if it
didn’t, a section of the on,e-third, being
drunk with its new authority, would run
wild and do much worse things than loot
a hardware store and batter the manager
of a meat-factory. Walsh must be re-
garded as a wholesale murderer by intent,
inasmuch as, being deranged with diseased
vanity, he advocates things which never
have been or can be done without slaughter.
Possibly, like some others of his kind,
slaughter would appeal to him. The frank
statement of his aims reveals the reason
Avhy his dupes were led into a strike Avhen
the friendly Arbitration Court —their own
Court — waiting for them. It was neces-
sary that the dissatisfied workers should get
no concessions except through Walsi-i, and
then Walsh would have to be made head
of a new Government that he might he able
to grant concessions. In fact, it all led up
to the supreme project of making Walsh
another Trotsky —who, by the way, Avas
also imported. Only an overgrown child
with penny romances and cheap pirate litera-
ture in his soul would have conceived the
idea, for Australia isn’t a separate empire
like Russia. It is only about one-ninetieth
part of an Empire in point of population,
and the other 89 parts might take umbrage.
They might even take more than that. It
is hard to say whether the incipient Thomas
the First should be shut up as a lunatic, or
taken seriously and tried on a charge of in-
citing to treason against the Commonwealth
and, incidentally, to murder. In a less degree
the question affects his wife and coadjutor,
Avlhose family seems to haA r e become the
enemies of society and of people’s Govern-
ments in general since the senior Pank-
hurst lady got into trouble in London over
suffragette disturbances. Only a person
with a wonderfully self-important idea of
the importance of a Pankhurst lady in’
London Avould start to wreck a continent
with her wrongs for inspiration. Still, his-
tory or legend recalls similar cases, includ-
ing those of John Cantacuzene. who is
said to have invited the Turks into Eurone,
and Julian, Avho is said to have helped the
Moors into Spain, and Benedict Arnold,
whose motives are uncertain. Large traitors
Avith small motives are common enough.
♦ ;
The Passing of an Old Political Identity.
In a recent issue Sydney Daily Telegraph,
Avhich was one of the bitterest opponents of
the Fisher Government’s original proposals
to amend the Commonwealth Constitution,
remarked :
Australia will insist that new conditions be re-
cognised, and that a remedy be found for defects
and inconveniences which were apparent before the
war. The expense of maintaining seven separate
-Governments was the most obA'ious, but not the
most serious, defect. Progress was hindered by fric-
tion, by uncertainty, and by the desire of each of
seven Prime Ministers to maintain his dignity, if
necessary at the expense of efficiency.
This is apparently the start of a bombard-
ment preparatory to “hopping the bags” in
the Nationaljst cause. And the thing is
natural. There are more and better reasons
now than ever there were for a strong cen-
tral administration with clearly-defined
powers. The Islands mandates, at the same
time as they provide Australia \A 7 ith strategical
security, impose on it tremendous respon-
sibilities in the form of administration; and
not improbably, for years to come, tremen-
dous expenses too. Predatory trusts and
monopolies are fostered by war, and we duly
have them with us. The Commonwealth
has anti-trust legislation on its Statute-book
which aroused the admiration of American
democrats ten years ago; but under our
Constitution most of it happens to be ultra
vires. In these and a dozen other ways the
Avar has made this matter urgent. There is
talk on both sides in the Federal House of
resubmitting the referenda proposals which
were rejected in 1911. But a better way
would be to recast the instrument. At one
end of the scale is a Constitution such as
that of England, which imposes on the
House of Commons the duty of handling
everything, from a great war down to a
row in a provincial police-station. At the
other end is ours, which, unless there is a
great war in progress, leaves the nation’s
Parliament in chronic doubt as to whether
it has any real power at all. The mean is
supplied by Canada. Under the Dominion
Act (1867) there is no such assertion of
State Rights as is embodied in the American
Constitution and in the Australian Common-
wealth Act. The provinces have certain
rights, expressly granted by Statute, and all
other rights and functions .are vested in the
Dominion Parliament. The war and the
circumstances arising from it clamor to us
to similarly set our own house in order.
Old State Rights need no longer be feared;
the bogey is laid even in. the office of
the Sydney Telegraph. And the men who
.count for most —those whose fighting saved
us —are eager to face the world not as
citizens of a number of warring States, but
as the Australians they were in France and
Egypt.
• Australian Defence.
“Field” : To get down to the facts of Aus-
tralian Defence, the original blunder was
made when two military organisations were
formed with the personnel of one largely
drawn from the personnel of the other—
the one organisation being for home defence,
the other for service overseas. Had this
elementary blunder not been perpetrated, the
reason behind the formation of the Army
Reserve —namely, to keep in the forces men
with practical war experience and with
their regimental traditions and regimental
pride—would not have existed. It is im-
possible to get away from the fact that the
Citizen Forces form our first line of defence
against attack. It is therefore obvious 'that
the more returned officers, n.c.o.’s and
men who are persuaded to join the Citizen
Forces the more efficient will that organisa-
tion become. And yet, at the present time,
the short period of annual training required
from members of the Army Reserve is being
held out by the organisers of the Reserve as
an inducement for men who previously were
members of the Citizen Forces to join the
Reserve, and so escape the longer train-
ing required of them as members of the
Citizen Forces; while, in the case of officers,
the inducement consists of having their A.I.F.
rank granted them in the Reserve, whereas
were they to continue in the Citizen Forces
they would revert to the rank they held
prior to the Avar, with only an empty
honorary title to show that they had
achieved rank at the Front. The original
idea of keeping the A.I.F. men. in the ser-
vice is undoubtedly sound, while to preserve
the regimental traditions of the A.I.F. is
very desirable. But to do so at the cost of
drawing from a partially-trained' active
army the very men whose presence in it
is the only possible factor whieh can infuse
into it the spirit of a fighting army is an
exceedinglv dangerous policy; and to do so
at an increased cost of a quarter of a mil-
lion pounds annually is not only dangerous
but criminal.

Jimmy Mitchell’s Job.
The meeting of the Westralian Parliament
has been postponed and postponed again ; and
a suggestion to put off the day until the end
of next year would meet Avith considerable
support. The turning off of the political
gas at the meter would at least give Premier
Mitchell a chance of getting his “produc-
tion” policy started; but with the opening
of the House on the Hill Ministers will be
compelled to give up their time and energies
to the old wearisome party game. Mitchell
on the floor of the Plouse is a Cockshy for
the other side. He thinks clearly enough,
but is slow at the uptake, and his speeches
drive the reporters to drink. But the mem-
ber for Northam likes to work 14 hours
a day, and his honesty matches his optimism.
There is no.doubt that the feeling of the
country, outside of a narrow circle, is to give
him and his new Government a fair trial on a
job that is anything but enviable. The last
financial year ended with a deficit of
£650,000, an accumulated load of £3,400,000,
and perhaps the heaviest per capita debt on
earth. The financial position is ghastly, to
put it mildly; and, in addition, the West
is beginning to be looked upon as a good
place to get away from, and its beggarly
population of a trifle over 300,000 wiil
speedily shrink if the rot is not stopped. It
may require a bigger man than Mitchell
to clean up the mess, but his motto of hard
work and more production offers the only
hope. He sees the quickest road to salva-
tion in the land. Unfortunately in Westralia
good and bad land alternate in a beAvilder-
ing manner, with more of the latter than
the former. Still, the State could certainly
provide its own breakfast, while at present
it pays Eastern States’ producers over £lOOO
a day for dairy products alone. Mitchell
is after this for a start, and he is hustling
the surveyors on to the good, patches in the
South-West, where the rainfall is more than
ample. Against the Premier is urged that
he was responsible for the farming boom of
a decade back which collapsed in the Scad-
dan Government’s day, leaving hundreds of
deserted farms and a semi-insolvent Agri-
cultural Bank. As Frank Wilson’s Lands
Minister, Mitchell unquestionably allowed
his optimism to bolt with his judgment; yet
the disaster might not have been so com-
plete but for the subsequent waste of money
• —money Avhich might have carried a good
many of the settlers through to success.
Still, no matter, 'how it may be promoted,
AA'heat-growing is not going to pull the West
out of the mud. On the other hand, mixed
farming and dairying have been proved to
be payable propositions—until, at any rate,
the State’s own needs are supplied. And
certainly the sane elements in the com-
munity should prefer a Government which

Island Administration.
“Tea 7 oro” : These Pacific Islands mandated
to Australia are self-supporting. If Ave are
going to be an expense to the Common-
wealth it can only , mean that we are going
to be badly administered. The most vital
question to us at the present moment is,
“Who are going to administer us? What
is the personnel?’ We have seen part of
the Commonwealth and M.L. administration.
We have read the conditions, mostly pro-
German. under which New Guinea was occu-
pied. We discuss among ourselves the hap-
penings among the Administrators of these
islands Which do not appear in print. We
hear of an Administrator seeing one-third
of the population around him dying of the
pandemic, countless bodies passing him
piled on lorries. The Americans, a few
hours’ steam away, offered assistance, which
might have saved thousands of the lives of
our brothers. The Administrator refused
it. You need to be one of us who lost
parents, sisters and brothers, while .40
American medical-officers stood idle, willing
and able to help us in a few hours, to know
what maladministration means to us. . Then
we have the Administrator who didn’t like
dogs, so he armed irresponsible natives with
guns to use promiscuously around the
streets, while the European residents, in
order to prevent their children from be-
coming gunshot casualties, had to keep in-
doors. And there was a Commissioner who
kept all Europeans out of the Legislature
to pander to the half-educated natives. We
do not blame him, but we do blame those
who sent him. On looking up his career
we find that his knowledge of island admin-
istration was learnt on a small sheep-farm.
Are we to continue with the new mandates
under such shocking administration? That
is one question that we are all asking each
other. And the other is “Who are the
Commonwealth and M.L. Governments going
to look to for advice?” Our minds turn
with a shudder to some of the octopus
firms that spread out their tentacles
through the Islands, and draw everything
to headquarters, regardless of the welfare
of the Islands or their inhabitants. Is
Australia going to give us a fair deal? Or
are we to be made a happy hunting-ground
to provide fat billets for a favored few?
“To Take Up Rural Pursuits.”
Dear Bulletin, —I came across this item
last week about a man whom I don’t know
from a crow, though I wish him well: —
Mr. James R. Dally, late accountant to the
Woollahra Council, who lately resigned in order
to take up rural pursuits, was presented with a pair
of entree dishes by the Mayor (Alderman Latimer,
M.L.A.).
It has been a tradition ever since the great
days of Rome that the public servant and
all sorts of other people retired after a
strenuous life to their country homes and
lived with dignity under their vine and fig-
tree. Therefore the Australian who is
weary of the city decides to do like Tiberius
and Gladstone and Beaconsfield, and
presently, having no experience to guide
him to his Paradise, finds himself fighting
the drought and the rabbits and the weevils
and the long distances and the low pricds
and the foxes and the bad roads and the
diminishing waterholes and all the rest.
Almost everybody who doesn’t know better
takes a turn at the land, and the money
they take there and don’t bring back is a
godsend to the business. I remember four
theatrical men of some standing within my
limited acquaintance— Albert Norman,
George Bullek, Charles Westmacott and
Howard Vernon —who took a “flier” at it
in their lighter moments. Westmacott, at
all events, brought back some cheerful
reminiscences. “One good thing I can ,say
for the cow,” he remark ed, “is that she is
easier to manage than the leading lady, and
sometimes she has more sense.” I know of
three retired steamboat captains who went
the usual way with the usual remark that
they were tired of ploughing the sea and
would plough, the land instead. One is
skipper of a coal-boat now; another mate
on a pig-boat. I don’t know what has be-
come of the third. A friend of mine has
had great luck, inasmuch as he got off his
farm, after six strenuous years, with as
much money as he put into it, and is now
doing well in another line. Two of lijs
neighbors who also brought city money into
the business haven’t managed to escape,
though the money has. They reckon it is
a life-sentence. The real farmer (I don’t
mean the squatter or the maii of many acres
who exploits share-farms, or the one whose
agriculture is an adjunct to a stock-and-
station business) is the man who was born
to wheat and hard living, and who is, or
thinks himself, unfitted for anything else,
wherefore he sticks. And his life is occasion-
ally brightened by the arrival in his neighbor-
hood of a sanguine stranger with some coin
and a pair of entree dishes.—Yours pessimis-
tically, Henry Horsecollar.

Dr. Maloney’s Suit.
The Anzae tweed industry has developed
into a kind of test case. It was started
as an occupation for partially-crippled
soldiers by the War Council before the Re-
patriation Department got going. This per-
haps made the Department feel rather iike
a mother-in-law to it. Hard figures'proved
that it could be run—was being run, in
fact —at a profit, and there was a great de-
mand for hand-woven tweed. Orders for
years ahead were forthcoming, and any
number more could have been had if there was
a chance of supplying the goods. And it
was shown that it was a simple kind of
art which partially-crippled men could learn
easily, and earn good wages at. Maloney,
M.H.R., paraded recently in a suit made by
a damaged warrior with three months’ ex-
perience, and people agreed that Maloney
looked well in it despite his chronic and
well-known need of a haircut. This proved
industry only asks for the advance of a
trifle of money—less than Millen’s De-
partment can spend in an hour in putting a
dozen impossibly-mortgaged ex-troops with
no agricultural experience on a “farm.”
Also it asks that there shouldn’t be so
many mysterious difficulties about its sup-
ply of yarn. Repatriation Minister Millen,
freetrader and land agent, denounced this
Australian industry offhand as being a hun-
dred years behind the times, by which he
possibly meant that it interfered with the
importation of the same class of behind-
time goods from foreign parts. Being much
worried and besought, he next said he would
look into the hand-woven tweed idea-—with all
the warm sympathy that a Freetrader Would
naturally feel. There was a pause of weeks.
Being further harassed, he promised to con-
sider the industry. Then there was a pause
of months. In fact, it requires so much
Pause to give a penn’orth of countenance to
an Australian manufacture, and so little to

buy £lOO,OOO worth of land, that only one
sort of repatriation gets a show. Therefore
Australia wants a new Repatriation Minis-
ter —and a new kind of Minister. The sort
required is neither an importers’ political
back nor a land-agent. Any repatriator is
out of place if lie starts with the conviction
that grubbing in the dust with a huge debt

Is the only fitting business for an ex-soldier,

A Great Bluff Called.
“Gunner’s” view of it: —
The events of the past five years have demonstrated
nothing more clearly than that warfare, in all but
its highest reaches, is the job of a sort of super-
schoolboy. One of the first essentials in the control
of bodies of men is the capacity to remember their
names and faces, and,, if possible, other details con-
cerning them. A schoolboy does it automatically.
His mind contains all such facts as that Smith
fields best at point, or kicks left-footed, or possesses
a useful right-cross in the ring. When he joins the
Army he knows the name of every man in liis
platoon within a week: in a month or less he is
acquainted with most of the battalion and with all
sorts of points useful for soldiering purposes con-
cerning individuals in it —such as that Jones is a
bootmaker and Robinson a horsebrealcer in civil life.
The nearer an officer is to the schoolboy, the better
chance he has, other things being equal, of making
his unit efficient and himself popular. A schoolboy
places tremendous store on the prestige of his school
if he is any good. Never since' I left school, well
over 20 years ago, have I seen such fierce excite-
ment as that of a very distinguished major during a
football match, played behind the line in France,
which his battalion team won narrowly from an-
other. The capacity to feel that way was one of
his best , assets as a soldier, though he probably
never suspected it. The slight equipment of tech-
nical knowledge which is requisite fqr modern
soldiering is most easily picked up, too, by young-
sters. One reason is that much of it is exactly the
sort of stuff they were doing when they' recently
left the classroom. These things are, in great part,
the explanation of what many people find the most
remarkable phenomenon of the war, namely, the vast
assortment of very youthful majors, colonels and
even generals that it has produced. An analogy is
drawn from the Bar, medicine, journalism, banking,
and so on; and on that basis the thing seems not
far short of miraculous. Yet when it is analysed
there is nothing miraculous about it. The \ com-
munity, instead of marvelling at its splendid young
soldiers, ought to do what it is at present foolishly
neglecting to do: that is, to use them.
A factor which makes profiteering easy—
almost a labor of love, in fact —is persist-
ently overlooked, and that is the snobbish-
ness which impels the customer to shy off
anything cheap. In every large business
this contempt for inexpensive goods on the
part of a considerable proportion of buyers
is an important consideration, and is worked
upon to the firm’s great advantage. Almost
fabulous prices are deliberately imposed
upon attractive items to meet the need of
the exclusive dame who simply wouldn’t
dream of purchasing anything whatever
which might seem to be within the reach of
the wretched herd. This passion is not
peculiar to the gilt-edged female; it extends
well down among the wives of wage-earners,
where it is the quintessence of vulgar pre-
tentiousness, and the source of a consider-
able part of those large fortunes with which
tradesmen scandalise the community and
fill press, pulpit and Parliament with vir-
tuous rhetoric that might wqll be reserved
for the home.
“O.Tv.”: A Train English article on “The
Peril of the Old Men,” referring to the fact
that the Kaiser and .others may really he
brought to trial for the crime of Europe’s
recent bloodshed, says:—
The point is to establish that henceforth an un-
just or wickedly waged war is going to be as dan-
gerous for the highly-placed people at home as for
the humble persons in the field. That done, the
tremendous sensitiveness of chancelleries and the
sabre-rattlings of Courts should be greatly lessened.
My argument for some years past has been
that the main hope of humble mankind
against the long-prevailing influence of mili-
tarism is in the aeroplane service, the young
forces of which will henceforth be in a posi-
tion to rain bombs on Courts, chancelleries,
military headquarters, Parliaments and any
other places where real war-makers abound
and actual fighters have no voice. Civilisa-
tion’s only weapon of defence against the
men who make wars is the flying-machine, as
potentially terrible to hoary-headed magnates
in cities far from fighting lines as to the
poor mud-stained fellows in the midst of the
fray. If there is to be no stronger deterrent
to war-making than a possibility of punish-
ment befalling the elderly instigators in the
event of their scheme failing—well, war will
continue to happen as before. The elderly
miscreants don’t fear a failure. They expect
to win. But if it be a certainty that the
cities of an invading Power will be bomb-d
from the air, and that flocks of reckless
young aviators will endeavor to search out
the haunts of the elderly mighty and drop
destruction on them —why, then the glorious
game of war will wear a new complexion,
and the old professional players will think it
time they abandoned their dreams of Fright-
fulness and took to bowls.
From a man in the business:—
As a body with a conscientious objection to Social
ism the Farmers and Settlers’ Association (N.S.W.) is
weirdly illogical in its proposal to meet the periodi-
cal drought calamity. It asks that the Federal Gov-
ernment should strike a figure of the loss caused by
an average drought, and finance, to that extent, the
purchase of hay and grain in good seasons, store and
pass same out to the cocky and squatter in drought
time, bringing the Jospru-in-Egypt stunt right up
to date. This is Sosh on a gigantic scale, com-
pared to which the State bakery and brickworks,
both projects that bring derisive condemnation from
the same crowd, are a irlere droplet in the sea. The
comparatively small drought of 1914-15, according
to the Farmers and Settlers’ Ass., meant a loss of
£7,000,000 in the Ma State, so 10 millions would
seem a modest estimate of the cost of this scheme,
and six times that amount would be wanted to cover
the Commonwealth. No mention is made as to the
selling price; but experience shows that the cocky
would expect something in the nature of a gift.

It was inevitable that someone at a Syd-
ney Millions Club banquet—it was Minister
Hall, in fact—should get off the moth-eaten
saying about “Peace with Honor.” Disraeli
of the oiled forelock and the glass
tear introduced the saying after the
Berlin Conference, where Bismarck was
allowed to bully the plenipotentiaries of
Europe like a schoolmaster—where the Un-
speakable Turk recovered some of his lost
territories, and the Serbs of Bosnia and
Herzegovina were handed over to Austria,
and Britain secured Cyprus as a bribe for
helping the Turk, and the practice of bring-
ing colored soldiers to Europe was resumed.
Bv reason of its bad associations that
“Peace with Honor” shibboleth should be
buried “with the burial of an ass.”
The late Sam McCaughey was a mass of
contradictions. As a money-maker he was
imaginative, far-seeing, progressive, ready to
listen to any new idea, and quick to see if it
was good. Outside business he was very dull,
lie never read a book; did not appear to
have at any time read anything worth calling
literature; and his contempt for poetry was
immeasurable. He classed poets with vaga-
bonds. No one understood the individual
working-man better, and he liked to yarn
with working-men. Yet he hated any
political movement with which they were
identified. His £lO,OOO gift to the Dread-
nought: Fund was far more intended, as a
smack at Labor than as a manifestation of
devotion to the Empire. He found a Con-
genial spirit in G. 11. Reid, not only in
Reid’s later days, but in the early part of
the present century, when the stout jester
was intensely unpopular in the Union Club
and in pastoral circles generally, owing to
his land legislation. McCaughey had even
less real humor than Reid had, but he loved
leg-pulling as Reid did, and his stolid, sheep-
Hk e f ace anc [ manner enabled him to do it
W ell. He had been a rich man for half a
ce ntury, yet in all that time he never par-
ticipated seriously in any sport or allowed
himself any diversion worth mentioning,
Travel, society, the theatre, music, art —
none 0 f these appealed at all to him. To
j-eep alive, to make money, and occasionally
to gj ve some of it away—these things were
all he asked. Many of his big donations

Samuel Grifflth is easily the greate - t Judge Aus .
tralia has known. Tha nearest approach to him as
a lawyer was James Martin, of N. S. Wales. The
best of Martin’s judgments, like many of Griffith’s,
are classics of Soundness, close reasoning and clear-
ness. The two men were alike in other respects.
Both loved scholarship for its own sake, and both
tried to express their artistic tastes in buildings,
Griffith’s riverside home in Brisbane is famous, and
so > 30 years ago, was the ornate Italian villa which
the much more affluent N. S. Males lawyer built in
Macleay-street, Sydney. The two greatest services
Griffith did for Australia were in advising on the
framing of the Bill for the Constitution Act, and,
later, in interpreting the Act in the High Court.
The Bill was the best, probably, that could have
been devised for Australia as Australia was 20
years ago—that is to say, for a collection of States
which wanted to federate into a nation while each
preserved practically all its previous pomp and cir-
cumstance. Since those days the Commonwealth
has found itself, and it may well be that the ex-
C.J. will do Australia a crowning service by advis-
ing on the framing of a Constitution adapted. to
the changed conditions.

trouble in Melbourne is suffering from

“Hamer”: The foreign-trade Minister of
Repatriation at any rate lives up to his
principles. I inspected some furniture which
was being carried into the Repat. Offices in
Sydney the other day. There was a nice,
large stamp on each of the articles, “Made
in Canada.” They were simple tiling cabi-
nets and things of that sort. MillenA duty
seems quite clear. If Australia’s work is
to be done in Canada, then obviously Aus-
tralia’s workmen should be in Canada; and
instead of landing Australians in Melbourne
or Sydney, they should be dropped at Hali-
fax or Vancouver.
Randolph Bedford in reply :—-
“Adolphus Bedstead” (B. 17/7/’l9) writes ap-
parently only to see in print the tremendous humor
of his noin de plume. For the rest, lie either
stupidly or perversely misinterpreted my objections
to the deportation without open t ial of Australians
Of German parentage or of naturalised Germans who
have married Australians and are the fathers of
Australian children. Let them be deported if open
trial shows their guilt; although even then we will
be deporting their Australian relatives too. “Bed-
stead” talks of “uninvited guests.” These were
guests invited by Australia’s immigration agents;
but my demands were not for consideration for these
only, but for consideration for their relatives —Aus-
tralian mothers and Australian children who would
be lost to Australia by the deportation of the Ger-
man fathers. What’s the objection to open trial,
anyhow? And that’s all I asked for.
Drummond, of the N.S.W. Wheat Board,
who made the sale of 11,000,000 bushels to
Georgeson, is one type of the successful
wheat cocky, and is liable to be quoted as
evidence that no cocky need fail except by
his own incapacity. Drummond let all or
most of his 2000 acres out on shares —that
is to say, he was the landlord. He ran a
stock and station business which, in addi-
tion to other activities, bought and sold
about a million bags of wheat a year, and
he was a member of the Baltic Exchange in
London. If there was so much wheat that
every cocky could collect “commish” by
selling a million bags per year, and enough
acres to give every man 2000 free of mort-
gage, and enough seats on the Baltic Ex-
change, the country might be full of Drum-
monds.
The reply of a committee appointed by a
general meeting of Customs Officers held at
the Customs House, Sydney:—
On June 26 there appeared in The Bulletin a
contribution from “Narrung”—an unwarranted and
cowardly attack on the honor and integrity of
Customs officers. “Narrung” suggested by innuendo
that the thieving and pillaging of cargo on the Syd-
ney water front and Customs warehouses is largely
attributable to the Customs officers. He has thus
branded the officers employed on wharves and in bonds
as thieves and pilferers of cargo, and has cast a re-
flection on the probity of Customs officers generally.
In order to prove his case, to his satisfaction he
cites a recent prosecution of a Customs officer in the
local courts. It is quite true that an officer of the
Customs Department was prosecuted and sentenced
to a term of imprisonment at the Central Criminal
Court recently. His offence was not, however, in
connection with the pillaging of cargo either on the
wharf or in bond. The officer was with others out-
side the Department arraigned on a charge of con-
spiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, to which all
pleaded guilty. The fraud was not on the mer-
chants of Sydney, but on the Customs Department.
It will, therefore, be seen there is no foundation in
fact -for the malicious indictments made by “Nar-
rung.” Further, “Na rung’s” statement that mer-
chants refrain from making claims in respect of
losses from wharves and bond stores owing to the
“dreary circumlocution of Customs procedure and
the terrible danger of arousing spite in a petty offi-
cial” is absurd. The officers have yet to learn that
any reputable merchant would tolerate or allow him-
self to be intimidated by what “Narrung” is pleased
to style “spite in a petty official.” Neither would
such conduct on the part of any officer, “petty” or
otherwise, be tolerated for one moment by the re-
sponsible head of the Department. It may be of
interest to “Narrung” to know that examination of
goods by the Customs is done in all cases only in
the presence of the owner or his representative. If
“Narrung” has knowledge of any specific cases
where officers have been guilty of the practices he
attributes to them,, it is his obvious duty, in the
public interest, to bring such cases under the notice
of the proper authorities, rather than rush into
print and wantonly malign a large body of reputable
citizens, comprising over 400 in this State alone.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The story about Acting Prime Minister
fatt having to resign “owing to ill-health”
is unhappily more than the conventional ex-
planation so often offered by politicians in
similar phraseology. Watt has a badly-
disordered heart, and in addition the curse
of insomnia has lately rested heavily on him.
In the reconstruction of N. S. Wales
Ministry Attorney-General Hall, the most
expert electioneering agent of the bunch,
becomes merely Minister for Housing. His
job is to see that the National party gets
good shelter. A Cabinet has rarely been so
frankly cynical.
In response to a circular sent to Par-
liamentarians by the Wharf-laborers’ Relief
Committee, acting for women and children,
Senator John Earle, of Tassy, forked out
20s. A letter went with the donation,
advising the women to “insist on the sea-
men’s demands being referred to the Arbifra-
tion Court.” The
committee returned
Earl e’s “paltry
£l,” declaring that
“our women would
rather starve than
accept your dole in
the circumstances
you offer it.” But
no starving woman
signed the counter-
blast which blew
Earle’s note back
to him. The people
most likely to
starve through the
strike have never
been given a hand
in any decision as
to their fate, the
matter of the
empty cupboard
having been ar-
ranged for them,
first and last, by
persons whose
class - consciousness
has been supported
by three square
meals a day.
SAM BARNES,
Vic. Minister for
Railways.
At the end of last w.eek the threat of
Thomas Walsh was that he would hunger-
strike in gaol to “compel” the Government
to do this or that. The attitude of the
hunger-striking person, whether his fast is
real or bogus, is a marvel of self-conceit.
Walsh stated in so many words that unless
the Government admitted that he was above
the law. he would die on its hands; and he
assumed that such a calamity was unthink-
able. The answer was obvious. Either the
State must stop caving in to hunger-strikers
or it must face the possibility of having one
day or other to let half the criminal popula-
tion out of gaol on this pretence. It may
as well stop now.
Darling, one of the big wheat-buyers of
Australia, and a member of the Central
Wheat Board, told the Pring Commission in
Sydney that the G6orgeson contract was
drawn by either rogues or fools. After-
wards he withdrew the rogues. And per-
haps they were not fools either. The wheat
was supposed to be of three or four different
grades; anyway, it was sold at three or four
different prices. Yet never a sample was
submitted: nobody said “This grade, so
much ; that grade, so much more.” No de-
posit was required, though the buyer w T as
given a monopoly of “the East” ; and the
contract might be cancelled by the Minister
without compensation. Yet all parties were
apparently quite satisfied. Darling shouldn’t
have called them fools. He should have
called them friends.
Mark Sheldon, who is to be the new Com-
monwealth ' Trade Commissioner in the
U.S.A., has his bag packed and labelled.
H. Y. Braddon will presumably return to his
job with Dalgety’s —he is that big co.’s
manager in Sydney. Sheldon is the head
of Dalton Bros., merchants, chairman of a
bank, and various other things. Presumably
he will remain in the U.S.A. for no more
than a year or so, Then he will, return
and take the knowledge he has gained as
Commonwealth Commissioner into his pri-
vate business. After which the manager
of another big private concern will go forth
and in due course return to his own business
after improving his education at the public
expense. The arrangement seems a pretty
poor one; and it migilt be still poorer if, as
could easily happen, general Australian in-
terests in America clashed with those of the
Commissioner and the Commissioner’s firm
during his term of office.
The manner in which the farmer’s com-
mandeered wheat has been disposed of might
reasonably set the people inquiring about
the metals, too. Certainly they haven t
been commandeered in every case; but it has
been made impossible for the man or com-
pany that produced them to sell them. And
some of the operations of the Government’s
agents in this matter have been scandalous.
For instance, a small quantity of spelter is
wanted for Australian industries, and actu-
ally the Australian manufacturer has had to
pay considerably more than London price.
The same anti-Australian sin has been com-
mitted as regards copper—the Australian
manufacturer has had to pay,. not merely the
London price, but the London price plus the
freight from London to Australia. In other
words,; so that the Australian manufacturer
should not get his natural advantage —the
advantage derived from living in the country
which produces his raw material —the price
has been fixed on the ridiculous assumption
that the material has * be6n taken for a
24,000-mile trip. When the N.. S. Wales
Board of Trade has finished overhauling
Sydney Ferries it ought to be turned on to
this whole metal-marketing ’question.
To celebrate peace and meet the high cost
of living, members of the Vic. Leg. Assembly
are urging an increase in the “reimburse-
ment” now 7 fixed at £3OO a year. Soundings
were taken at the end of last week. One of
the Economy party chieftains was said to
be willin’ to support anything up to £5OO.
What the increase should be those agitating
for a rise were not agreed. John Gavan
Duffy declared that the Irvine Government
fixed its original proposal for the reduction
of members to 56 because Shiels said the
number was half a hundredweight. Perhaps
£9 a week will be adopted bedause there
were nine Muses.
The debate in which Richard Butler sought
to get the S. A. Assembly to publicly declare
him spotless Avas a pathetic thing. It soon be-
came evident that the Labor party disliked
the ex-Treasurer so much that it would not
vote for him even to damage Peake. The
whole debate reflected the opinion of the
public, expressed in a few words by Edwards
for the Labor party: “We don’t think he js
a thief; but we think he is a muddler.”
Gunn, the Labor leader, added that, while
it has no confidence in the general adminis-
tration of the Government, “we believe that
in this single instance Ministers did right,
and we shall support them.” A good-
natured member moved as an amendment
that Butler’s honor is not impaired by the
findings of the Commission; but it was felt
that to carry this would be condemning the
Commission. Both motion and amendment
were lost without being pressed to a division.
The debate was peppered with some savage
personalities. Butler believes that anybody
actively opposed to him is ungrateful and
treacherous; and some of those whom he
attacked hit back unsparingly.
“Match Rifle”: At a Sunday public meet-
ing in Melbourne one Bourke, a delegate of
the Seamen’s Union, is reported to have
said: “We cannot find a way out by revo-
lution, because the people of Australia are
not trained for it.” Now, that’s where I
differ from him. I, for instance, am not
only trained, but in a measure prepared for
revolution. I have two rifles and an auto-
matic pistol, plenty of ammunition, a villa
with a fairly clear field of fire, two soldier
sons who know all the new tricks, a wife
and daughter who are both good nurses, a
cellar, and enough money to buy a supply
of food, drink and medical stores. I don't
want revolution any more than the loud Mr.
Bourke does. It is all right as a Foolish
Sunday Afternoon topic, and no doubt Mr.
Bourke enjoys frightening himself and his
friends. But if the worst came to the worst
I would probably do better on my suburban
roof than he would in town with an un-
familiar 12s. 6d. revolver that exploded in
his hand as soon as it grew foul. If it
comes to a matter of resources and artillery
I have Mr. Bourke beaten. But I can’t
beat him at the ballot-box. He carries as
many guns there as I do. So he’d better
think it over.
N. S. Wales Government gave Justice
Pring a commission to inquire into the cir-
cumstances of the sale of 72,000 tons of
THE RIVAL DECORATIONS.
“Between Dec. 6, 1916, when Mr. Lloyd George
became Prime Minister, and June 1, 1919, the
following hereditary honors were given to civilians,
soldiers and sailors respectivelv: To civilians, 154;
to sailors, 1; to soldiers, none.”
The Soldier: “Hum —where do I come in?”
The Decorated Civilian : “Poof, my friend.
You have your wounds!”
inferior wheat to George Georgeson. His
Honor hasn’t found anything that smells as
bad as some of the old wheat stacks.
But he has had tons of evidence-of shock-
ingly loose management. Poor Cocky had
his wheat commandeered ; it was taken right
out of his control, alul because it was then
scandalously neglected millions of bushels
were either lost outright or turned into pigs’-
feed. Yet not the Government which did
the commandeering, but Cocky, who had no
say in the matter, has been compelled to
stand the loss. Pring’s Commission is
valuable really because it illustrates how
the whole business has been mishandled.
Speaker Coneybeer, of S. A. Assembly, has
ruled that the exhibition in the House of a
placard, not required by the matter under
discussion, is out of order. It was simply
an exhortation in large red letters, displayed
bv some Labor members: “Fight on, and
clean up.” It might be a harmless copy-
book maxim, but Premier Peake saw Bol-
shevism in it, and the Speaker ordered it
out.
The Government had one lucid interval
—it didn’t release all its lunatics on Peace
Day. But it turned loose Peter Simonoff,
Bolshevik prophet and alleged Consul-
General for a hostile Power, so that he
would be in time to help with the strike.
And a lot of boys were set free from the
Mittagong (N.S.W.) labor farm. They
weren’t under sentence, but for the most
part were simply the sons of lazy or vicious
or criminal parents whom the State was
endeavoring to give a chance in life. And
their chance, was cut short by way of a
celebration, just as the most promising stu-
dents might be expelled from a university
out of pure joy and thankfulness.
When John Hancock exclaimed “Thank
God for the sacred right of Revolution!”
Dunky Gillies flung back: “Yes, and thank
God for the sacred right of Hanging !” Adel-
aide began last week to sympathise with
Gillies. Thanks to the seamen’s revolt, the
Adelaide Tramways Trust ran so short of
coal that services were confined to the “busi-
ness” hours of the day. An overhead
electric service cannot save anything worrh
mentioning, as railways can, by cutting out
at slack times; it must be able to turn the
power off altogether. So, after a month of
closing at 7.30 p.m., it'shut off at 9.30 a.m.,
and long lines of cars banked up in the
streets till four, when people were taken
home. Curfew rang at 6.30, and the cars
stopped for the night.
The latest suggestion is that Maoriland
should be divided into a number of States,
with Federal control of
national matters. The
idea issued from G. W.
Russell’s mouth in a
recent speech at Christ-
church, but has been in
the minds of many men
for many days. The fact
that Wellington, the
Cinderella of Maoriland
cities, should be the
centre .of all things in
the islands, annoys other
places. The West Coast
would like to be a State
with its own laws about
timber, liquor, coal and
racing. Auckland, own-
ing half of the North
Island, hates even to
post letters to Welling-
ton, while Otago has its
own ideas on theology
and the fourth dimen-
sion. Canterbury would
like reciprocal agree-
ments with the other
States, with a preferen-
tial clause as regards the
West Coast. Taranaki
and Wellington are old
cobbers, and the two
would jog along quite
comfortably with their
hats pulled down over
their ears to shut out
the gossips’ idle talk.
Hawkes Bay would want
a moat made all round
her to keep Poverty Bay
in her place. The most
easily pleased of all
would be Marlborough.
Make Marlborough
Sounds the naval base,
and she would kiss all
her sisters on the least
provocation. Southland would probably
hear the news of the setting-up of separate
States in time to send to Dunedin for some
more beer. It takes a man like Russell lo
dig up bones of contention.
An extension with loan money of the
Sydney-Bourke railway is proposed, the idea
being to facilitate the transfer of live beef
from Queensland. The Bourke line (511
miles) is regarded as the longest in the Ma
State. It is one of five that reach out tp
the Darling or Barwon. The last-published
railway report gives their losses for the year
and the dates when the lines were opened :
Bourke (1885) .. Loss, £22,696
Brewarrina (1901) .. ~ 7,141
Collarenebri (1906) .. „ 5,512
Walgett (1908) .. „ 4,977
Mungindi (1914) .. ~ 14,329
Two of the termini, Bourke and Brewarrina,
with the oldest railways, are in a county
that is losing population. The town of
Bourke, with the oldest railway of all, had
only half the population at the 1911 census
that it had in 1891, when its line was just
beginning to develop the great natural re-
sources. How old does a railway have to
be before the development of the resources •
begins to attract population?
“Fax”: Now that thousands of working
men have been thrown out of employment by
a shortage of coal, it may be opportunely
remarked that Hughes’s contemptuous
repeal of the Daylight Saving Act was done
in response to the complaints of a section
of the workers and their wives. Other
countries have duly recognised the saving
grace of Daylight Saving. Having adopted
the system they stuck to it. Australia
didn’t. It allowed the old waste of lighting
power to be resumed after three months’
trial of the healthful economy.
In Melbourne last week the Government
was coolly asked to subsidise the so-called
strike, which was really a revolution, being
an open defiance of the law. In other
words, it was demanded that all public relief
should be distributed by the Trades Hall
so that only strikers might be assisted. Even
the Ministerial worm turned at that point.
“AS IT WAS ”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There is an increasing difficulty in finding hous-
ing accommodation .for returned soldiers.”
Ere the first roof-tree was hewn into being,
Ere the dawn-wind of Creation was still,
Herded for safety, alert arid far-seeing,
Chose we our caves near the crest of a hill.
First in the council as first in the fight,
Dooga the Brave took the largest by right.
Fierce swooped the foe in the chill of the morning,
Reiving our cattle, or maybe our wives.
Up sprang our men at the sentinel’s warning,
Ready to pay for our rights with their lives.
Forth to the conflict rushed Dcega the Brave;
Slaaka, the craven, lay crouched in his cave.
Back from the battle crept Doaga, sore smitten,
Victory won at the cost of a life.
Slaaka, the craven, with avarice bitten,
Took Dooga’s cavern, and with it his wife.
Doaga, the while all the tribe held aloof,
Died in a small one with leaks in the roof.

The Q.N. was one of the very few banks
in the Commonwealth whose disclosed pro-
fits did not sag at some time or other dur-
ing the war. Even in the dark patch to-
wards the middle of last year the half’s
profits were £3OOO more than in the simi-
lar term prior to Wilhelm’s adventure.
But this bank has been on an exceptional
footing. It was badly rattled in the ’nine-
ties : a lot of capital and reserves dis-
appeared, while 15s. in the £ of the private
deposits was presently converted into inter-
minable stock, the remaining ss. to be
made aood out of profits before shareholders
could get a div. In addition £1,833,327 of
Government deposits lent on depreciated
securities had to be provided for. It was
a mountainous dead-horse that general-
manager Ralston had to struggle with.
However, the Northern State rapidly re-
covered, and the National went ahead
so fast that the management found it pos-
sible to shift the load much faster than
had been planned, while also strengthening
the bank’s foundations. As the table shows,
before the last of the old debts had been
met visible reserves of over £200.000 had
been accumulated; and so much had been
provided.inside for continaencies that, when
war threatened trouble, the directors de-
cided that there was no need to lay by more
out of profits than usual.
Profits for the past year were eomal to
over 22| p.c. of the capital as written down.
Shareholders have had 10 p.c., but as this
div. required less than half the amount
available for distribution, and as reserves
are not calling for large additions, the direc-
tors devised means by which shareholders
might get a further bite without lifting the
dividend rate to a figure that would in-
vite criticism. Subscribed capital six months
ago stood at £BOO,OOO (160,000 shares of
£5 each) and paid capital £480.000, repre-
senting £3 per share. The directors decided
to get in the uncalled £2 per share, in four
instalments spread over 12 months; and at
June 30 paid capital had been thus increased
to £691,850. Since shareholders get 10 p.c.
on this new capital the arrangement suits
them very well.
This comparison shows the very rapid pro-
gress made during the past 10 years:—

The 138 p.c. increase in private deposits in
10 years is very flattering, because over the
same period deposits in the State have ex-
panded by only 60 p.c. In other words, the
Q.N. has been increasing its deposits at just
double the average speed of banks in Queens-
land.
The balance-sheet discloses a very strong-
position. At June 30, apart from intermin-
able stock (which for all practical purposes
is very cheap pref. capital—it carries only
34 p.c.) total liabilities amounted to
' £9,881,585. Of this 66 p.c. is held within
easy reach. Incidentally, there have been
some interesting movements in the composi-
tion of the liquid assets as a result of the
Commonwealth’s war financing :

Cash balances and money at
short call 29.8 „ 7.8 „
Bills . . . . • • • • 43.6 ~ 21.0 ~
To meet the £3,354,222 of liabilities not re-
presented by liquid assets there are over
seven millions of advances, and also the
premises. The position from the point ot
view of the customer is thus very secuie.
And the foundations are there for a very
much bigger business.

This is the Southland Building Society’s
■jubilee year, and in a comprehensive souvenir
the directors tell the story of its life. It has
been a wonderfully successful little concern,
and has helped Invercargill to own more ot
the homes it lives in than any other town m
Maoriland. During the 50 years it has
advanced £1,136,126 and distributed £215,01 •>
pf profits among borrowers. Like all otner
reputable building societies, it lias perfoimcd
excellent service by assisting householders
to shake off the landlord incubus. Lor some
years it has been charging its clients 6 p.c.,
but, as the directors point out, since the
borrower gets divs., the net interest rate
works out at only about p.c. p.a. on a
loan of 13 years’ currency.
While adding its congratulations, The
Bulletin is impelled to remark that the
management has had amazing luck. Over
the half-century the total losses incurred on
realisation of foreclosures have amounted to
only £3959, or i p.c. of the turnover, and
since 1900 only £T has gone this way. Lo
meet these losses the society has dipped into
a reserve fund which looks like a joke.
The table shows that after its 50 years
only £3957 of undivided profit has been
accumulated, and of this £3518 represents
the balance at credit of the reserve fund.
The rules provide that not exceeding 1 p.c.
of mortgages current shall be held in this
reserve, and the directors reply to this
paper’s previous criticisms on the inadequacy
of this fund by stressing the fact that only
i p.c. has been lost. They also aeffi that
their advances leave a margin' of 25 p.c.
on town properties and 33J p.c. on suburban
and country securities., and that the repay-
ment instalments rapidly . create a further
protecting reserve. Which is true; but
sui’ely the Southland directors know that
scores of building societies in the Common-
wealth were working on similar “conser-
vative” lines, and that many are now defunct
while others are still working off dead-horses.
The Bulletin can ohly repeat that the
Southland has been remarkably fortunate;
Invercargill has experienced nothing out of
the way in land booms or slumps, so this
society has not been hit. Some day, though,
the district may acquire a get-rich-quick
hustler, and there may be another story to
tell.
The insignificant reserve fund is not the
nly weakness. This helps to explain why:
Debenture
Capital. Liabilities. Advances.
1900 .. .. £60,770 £21,092 £74,889
1905 .. .. 60,920 49,722 112,575

1919 .. .. 242,042 122,518 360,655
The “debentures” would be more appro-
priately described as deposits; some repre-
senting merely 3 p.c. call-money, while the
rest is in the management’s care for terms
un to only two years. Further, capital is
not fixed, and apparently share-purchasers
can withdraw when they choose, though the
directors claim that withdrawals are a source
of profit to the society and that the pay-out
can be regulated. But what would happm
if trouble suddenly hit Southland? For a
start no new deposits would be forthcoming,
while the whole of the £122.518 would be
due within two years (£99,778 was called
for during the past 12 months), and in-
addition there would be the maturing shares
(£32,927 last year) and the withdrawn
shares to meet, both the latter being regu-
lated by rotation and ballot if it came to the
worst. To meet such a position the society at
the end of April had £360,655 of its £372,364
of assets tied up in mortgages. At present re-
payments are coming in at the rate of about
£67.500 per annum, but not only would a lot
of this income dry up if trouble set in, but
there would be a fine crop of properties on
the society’s hands to test the strength of the
little reserve of £3518. How the directors
could meet even the depositors under such
circumstances The Bulletin has not the
slightest idea. But Invercargill probably
will not believe it possible that trouble can
ever intrude on its peacefulness.

Queensland Brewery directors are not visibly
perturbed by t'he threatened no-liquor hurri-
cane, and are even inviting shareholders to
put more capital into the business. Bung
has been on a particularly good wicket in
the Northern State, for not only have war
conditions kept the beer-pumps jigging, but
the Ryan Government also refused to cur-
tail trading hours. And since this oo.’s

Management exes. &
depreciation . . 14,435 26,502 46,791 54,748
But note that whereas exes, (including un-
specified amounts for depreciation) took 63.2
p.c. of the gross profits in 1914, the bite is
now 78.8 p.c. So, despite the expansion of
the business, the margin left for share-
holders is now smaller than it was four and
five years ago, although meantime £4444 of
new capital has been put up.
This comparison of the balance-sheet
figures records the 10 years’ progress in
another way :
1909. 1914. 1919.
Capital £29,250 £60,000 £93,333
Liabilities . . . . . . 30,165 26,709 31,750

Book debts . . .. 11,661 32,847 39,364
Cash, etc 794 13,527 12,434
In this table the amounts dropped into the
contingency reserve are not regarded as
lost. In view of the fact that depreciation
is otherwise allowed for and that over three
years ago the directors dipped into the fund
to provide bonus shares, the £9412 at pre-
sent to the credit of the account is treated
as a true reserve, though owing to previous
doubts each year’s contribution is shown as
written off in the first table. The balance-
sheet movements over the two terms can be
summarised in this way :
( Five years to

Between 1909-14 £18,923 was passed out in
divs.; during the past five years, £36,141.
That a froth and hops factory could show
these vastly-improved figures during the pro-
gress of a world war is an indictment of
war finance and a few other things. Premier
Ryan’s refusal to stop the flow of beer after
6 o’clock does not exculpate the Common-
wealth Government; for there is clearly
something seriously wrong with a country
which charges 222 j millions of its 2684
millions war bill to loans and creates con-
ditions which enable its citizens to bend
their elbows more frequently than during
peace years when profligate State Govern-
ments were maintaining mild booms on bor-
rowed money. Having made no serious
attempt to pay for our share of the war.
the bill and its added weight of interest have
to be met in the future, and brewery share-
holders can rest assured that beer is going
to carry its share of the burden. Perhaps
more than its share.
There are at present 250,000 shares fully
paid to 6s. Bd. (£93,333). The directors
now propose to dip into reserves for £6667
and distribute the unissued 20,000 shares as
a bonus. This will bring paid capital to
£lOO,OOO, and it is suggested that in place
of every three shares a fully-paid £1 share
should be issued, thus making the nominal
and paid capital 100,000 shares of £1 each.
The nominal capital is to be increased by
an additional 50,000 shares, parcels of this
unissued lot being offered to present holders
as further working capital is required. On
a £lOO,OOO capital present profits are
sufficient to provide a 12J p.c. div. after
the usual contingency-reserve cut has been
made; so if recent performances can be
maintained there would be no difficulty in
passing out 8 p.c. on a still larger capital.
Whether beer will continue as profitable in
the hard days ahead The Bulletin cannot
guess until the politicians decide how they
are going to shift the Commonwealth’s huge
indebtedness. Meantime, though the Queens-
land Brewery has net assets of 13s. 7d. to
represent each of the present Gs. Bd. shares,
the investor is very shy, and the stock is
at a discount of a couple of pence.

This iittle co., with £30,000 capital and a
Board of a dozen heavyweights, runs Syd-
ney's Royal Exchange. George Judah Cohen
and his team of directors would feel quite
ashamed of themselves if out of any other
enterprise with which they were connected
they could not squeeze more than the G p.c.
p.a. which this co. has paid for many years.
But shareholders are not out to make
fat divs.; in a sense the concern is a public
utility in Sydney commercial circles, and
shareholders are satisfied with a modest re-
turn and the excellent security for their
capital. Revenue comes from “subscriptions
from members and firms, advertising boards,
rents, interest, etc.” Exes, have, of course,
been increasing during recent years ; and addi-
tional charges and rents have been collected
to keep something like the old balance be-
tween income and outgo. Some years back
the Exchange buildings stood in the books
at £70,000 ; but they have since been writ-
ten down to £55,000, which must be a very
modest figure compared with present values.
Naturally a capital of £30,000 was insuffici-
ent to finance the concern, and the manage-
ment has been depending on debentures, of
which there was a heavy load some years
ago. This shows how much has been shifted
in 10 years :

Liabilities .. .. £24,549 £15,926
Liquid assets .. .. 6,862 4,464
Excess liabilities .. £17,687 £11,462
Slow going, considering the modest rate of
div. paid, but the movement is in the right
direction.

Twelve months ago capital stood at £165,000,
in 220,000 shares of 15s. During the year
ss. per share (£55,000) has been handed
back; and for every two of the old shares
reduced to 10s. one of £1 has been issued in
exchange. Thus the capital of £llO,OOO is
now in £1 fully-paids. The refund of capital
has all come from the sale of properties.
The co. in its earlier years owned consider-
able timber-yard and other areas in city and
suburbs, and in 1909 the balance-sheet in-
cluded a dozen properties with a book-value
of £100,670. During the next five years
there were two revaluations of these assets,
each exhibiting a surplus of £lO,OOO over
book-values ; and reserves benefited by these
writings-up. However, the properties
mostly in congested areas—have been un-
loaded, and the business centralised, and by

1913 only £44,000 worth remained on the
books. How the item has moved since then
cannot be ascertained from the balance-
sheets, which nowadays tell shareholders
very little.
Assets are now grouped under four heads
in this way :
Machinery, plant, etc. . . .. .. £39,909
Stock in trade . . . . . . .. 30,424
Sundry debtors and shares in other cos. . . 116,305
Reserve fund (invested outside the business) 55,000
Incidentally, this reserve fund has been taken
right out of the balance-sheet, and is now
shown separately; no doubt it was reckoned
that the huge composite item “sundry debtors
and shares in other cos.” would look a little
less formidable that way. Apparently, to
repay capital without throwing investments
on a weak market the co. has had to lean
on the bank ; anyhow, the sundry creditors
item now stands at £67,400 compared with
£30,289 a year ago. Assuming that as much
as, say, £30,000 is owing by sundry debtors,
then there is no less than £140,000-odd
invested “outside the business” according to
the balance-sheet, and only just over £lOO,OOO
working in the business. On the other side
the co. now owes no less than £67,400.
Without information as to the nature of the
outside investments, very little can be gleaned
as to the present success of Goodlet and
Smith as suppliers of building materials.
Taking into consideration that there are
reserves equal to half the paid capital, the
dividend return is very moderate, while the
margin left after paying shareholders 8 p.c.
is so slender that it would not take much
to reduce the rate of div. The small
return may be due to the fact that the
investments are very gilt-edged; but Tiie
Bulletin would like more information
about them than is provided by the balance-
sheet figures before recommending its maiden
aunt to hand over the 28s. 3d. which holders
are asking for the shares, despite that there
are net assets with a book value of about
31s. Maybe the investments are healthy
and are as well written down as the co.’s
own plant; but the outsider is left quite in
the dark on such matters.

The decision of the Warden at Maitland
that the N.S.W. Mining on Private Pro-
perty Act, passed last session, applies to
coal-bearing lands has caused a commotion
in. the Northern districts. Numerous ap-
plications have been lodged for the leasing
of valuable coal blocks, and on the decision
of the Warden these will have to be granted
if the necessary legal formalities have been
complied with. A. Holland, mining agent,
of Sydney, was the first to test the appli-
cability of the law to freehold coal
lands by applying for a block of over 1000
acres adjoining the Caledonian Colliery, for
which block the owner is said to have re-
fused £25,000 quite recently. All the forces
of the law were arrayed against the appli-
cant, at the instance of the owner and of
adjoining proprietors, and several days
were spent in argument. The Warden’s de-
cision fixing the surface value at merely a
nominal figure also created consternation in
the land monopolists’ camp. The sudden-
ness with which land, which had not been
considered worth fencing in, became ex-
tremely valuable for grazing • purposes, was
amazing, and that the Warden should assess
it at “unfenced” value was denounced as a
gross infringement of the sacred rights of
property! Incidentally, the owners had at
least three months after the passing of the
amended Act in which to make an attempt
to have the coal worked before Holland
applied for right to enter. Since the law as
now interpreted applies to all areas acquired
under the old iniquitous m.c.p. law, the
owners of such areas will have to work
them (if there be anything on them worth
working), or pretend to do so, or walk out.
It is not generally known that nearly all
the Blue Mountain lands along the railway
route from Penrith to Wallerawang were
taken up under this law (principally by an
old political syndicate), which gave selectors
a freehold title on their alleging that they
had spent £5 per acre on “mining work” —
which accounts for the grave-holes that
travellers notice along the line.
Rumor goes . that before Holland left
Maitland after his application had been
granted he was offered £50,000 on a month's
option for his rights! Apart from legal
exes, he had to outlay only 10s.—5s. with
the apnlication and ss. for a miner’s right.
The N.S.W. Mine Owners’ Association
finds a kick at last. Its council has adopted
a series of resolutions, one of which declares
that the system now in vogue has “created
a monopoly of trading in favor of a few l
selling firms,” which has resulted in great
loss to the producers; and in another: —
The Association demands that the restraint of
trade in the metals produced by its members, being
now, they believe, illegally and unconstitutionally
enforced by the Federal Government, be ended forth-
with.
The responsibility for the scandalous mis-
management of the metal-selling business
rests primarily on Hughes. He knew nothing
of the very complex trade; yet he took it
into his own hands, seeking advice only
from those wlio knew very little more about
it than he did himself. The abominable
system of party government closed the
mouths of members on one side and dis-
counted any remarks that those on the other-
side might make; and it was the same with
the newspapers. So the scandal has per-
sisted month after month and year after-
year. to the profit and glory of a very few
people and the starvation of'others.

Block 14 Co. has had no luck hitherto
with its tin, wolfram and bismuth show at
Torrington (N.S.W.), but it is reported
that there is now a brighter- hope in the
discovery of a fair-sized body of cobalt ore,
for which there is a good demand at a satis-
factory price. This is quite a new feature
in the Butler formation, which is one of the
largest and most persistent in length in
Australia, and which in its course has pro-
duced almost every known mineral except
gold. Taking a view on the summit of any
of the high hills around Torrington, the
formation is distinctly discernible both ways
as far as the eye can reach, appearing as a
razor-backed ridge which keeps a. consistent
course through all classes of rocks, the
mineral contents varying with the strata.
It has been surface-scratched for many
miles, but at very few points has any serious
attempt: been made to work it at depth. As
a field for a big prospecting enterprise this
great mother-lode presents most attractive
features, but the law would have to be
materially amended to offer reasonable in-
ducement to. speculators to attack it.
* * * *
Rocky River Mines, N.L., has taken over
the property about 18 miles out from Ten-
terfield (N.S.W.) which was previously
worked by a smaller co. The present go is
in 80,000 10s. shares, of which 60,000 have
been issued. The chief trouble will be the
production of a good-grade concentrate, as
the ore contains molybdenite, wolfram and
bismuth. Even if the molybdenite concen-
trates could be dressed up to the required
90 p.c. the bismuth contents are certain to
prove troublesome. How the bismuth im-
purities are to be eliminated down to 1 p.c.
is the problem for F. IT. Molesworth,~ who
has an interest in the show.
Kampong Kamunting’s figures for the
second half of 1918 have just drifted in from
the Taiping (F.M.S.) headquarters. Here
is the wonderful record of the past three
terms: —

Working Piofit . . ..£42,333 £38,394 £53,369
Divs. paid .. ..£24,500 £28,000 £42,000
With better ground to. handle and a good
market the co. had a very sweet run during
the last half, despite the fact that working
costs ran away with almost sd. per yard.
But the directors entertain no illusions
about the future; even with tin at a con-
siderably better figure than in pre-war days
they confide that owing to heavy costs “it is
unlikely that such a large profit will recur.”
So, though they hope to maintain 2s. quar-
terly distributions (6s. was handed out for
the last half), they whisper that a reduc-
tion to Is. 6d. may be necessary. The
original shareholders have had a gorgeous
time. At the end of last year the co. had
been producing for a little over three years.
Paid capital is £140,000, and at the balance
£157,500 had already been returned in divs.,
while, apart from plant, there was an
amount equal to half the paid capital in
investments, stores (written down heavily),
and other liquid assets after meeting all
liabilities. Starting with an expected 10
years’ life the co. has since .acquired several
small areas (it recently paid £2OOO for 56
acres of low-grade ground), and with 119
acres already treated it has 519 still ahead
of the dredges, which means a further 12 to
13 years’ work.
A year ago Kampong Kamunting under-
took to foster-mother the Asam-Kumbang,
another Freeman show near Taiping which
should have been producing by now if its
dredge had not been delayed. Kampong agreed
to advance up to £50,000 in 7 p.c. debentures
to equip the property; with the right to take
up 10,000 unissued £1 shares at 2os. -apiece.
Delays, however, have proved expensive, so
Kampong has undertaken to advance a fur-
ther £lO,OOO at 7 p.c., with the right to take
up the remaining 15,000 unissued shares,
also at 255., during the currency of the
loan. The co. thus has the call on 25.000
shares at a ss. premium, and, if every f-ing
goes all right with Kumbang (A. W. Free-
man reported that there were over
million yards of ,901 b. ground and a fur-
ther 2 millions of .58 stuff), Kampong gets
in nicely just one short step above "the
ground floor. . To provide the necessary
props the co. is leaning on its bankers, but
with sweet pickings in prospect shareholders
are not at all concerned about such a small
matter as an overdraft.

Tongkah Compound ought to have had its
creel full of mining beauties, for it started
life well at the heels of the Tongkah Harbor
boom. It lacked earth-hunger, being too full
of satisfaction with the splendid run of
dividends it enjoyed after starting its
dredge. Probably nervousness as to the
future of the tin market has been respon-
sible for its failure to reach out for
the good things that Austral-Malay and
others picked up. There came a time when
it had to look round, so a long list of
Eastern tin shows have filed in and out of
the office. The last three include the
Punngha, which was dropped ; then the co.
looked at the Rassa with a favoring eye,
but there must have been a hitch over terms,
for it was withdrawn. Now the Seramban,
to which the locals attach a 15oz. grade in
a block of 120 acres, with lots of possi-
bilities in option blocks all round, is said
to be on the Compound table for inspection.
In the old claim about ss. of profits is still
ahead of the plant; so. with a new show to
get into, the Compound’s life may still be
measured by years—unless, of course, the
Trong episode is repeated.

Mining-engineer A. E. Lewis, who nowa-
days hangs out his signboard at Ipoh
(F.M.S.), and who sampled Kamunting,
Asam Kumbang and Kalumpang, pleads not
guilty to having bored the Bang Tao, men-
tioned on this page (17/4/T9). The Bang
Tao is another of the properties that Tong-
kah Compound let slip, and it has been
taken under the Tongkah Harbor wing. It
contains 256 acres of good-grade ground
suitable for shallow-digging dredges;' and
gives the Harbor’s old plant a further lease
of life.
What is this that T. W. Orton—not
T. W. Horton, of the Austral Malay—tells
Badak syndicate, which is homed in Edna
Central McMurtrie’s Queen-street office? Tin
oxide averaging 61b. to 71b. over a width
of ever so many chains of lead ! If so, it is
the sweetest thing since Miles’s picture of
the millions in Tongkah Harbor was un-
veiled. A crowd quite new to tin is in the
syndicate. One director has flitted to the
Orient to chat over this amazing adventure.
Dahnayne Colliery (Tas.) has some Gov-
ernment on the hook which is willing and
ready to take the whole of its output “at a
very good price,” with the said Government
“extremely anxious for the delivery of the
coal at the earliest possible moment.”
Apparently all that remains is the construc-
tion of the new loading-station. And how
long will that take? Reid Bell’s project for
an island bin has been approved provided it
can be financed and that some mariner de-
clares the site of the station safe for vessels.
Old Cap’n Davis is said to be the man to
look into this side of the proposition. So
confident are the Dalmayne optimists that
they don’t baulk at the likelihood that it
may be a long day before an island hopper
can be dug into a slab of the seashore that
will hold it up against the storms that buffet
the east coast of the Speck. Their plan is
to get the plate filled as fast as possible.
To do that they want the shareholder to
pay up on the nail 3s. 6d. calls in advance;
and they also propose putting out 38,000
reserve shares among debenture-holders and
shareholders. But why ask shareholders to
hop over on this little stunt? They will
have parted up ss. per share to improve the
position of the debenture-holder, so why
should not the latter with his bag of bonus
shares come up with a big contribution mi
this occasion? Anyhow, to make sure about
the projected shipping' facilities, the co. had
better top off its mariner’s recommendation
with a check report on both his and Reid
Bell s proposals.

With Langi Logan South only at develop-
ment w T ork, New Langi has been getting
more parties into its wash. So the same
old swan-song is heard. Given more men,
the day of call-making may go. But what
about a few facts concerning costs to-day
and the width of the run of gold being
stoped? The need for this is that when the
Gathcart gutter swept into the New Langi
it was about 200 ft. wide, but the gold was
m a i narrow run on the high bank. Does
Toole say it has widened in the subsequent
south-westerly sweep of the tributary into
the Langi lead? The very latest is that
some busybody is talking of a merger be-
tween the South and the New Langi. As if
oi. and water can mix!

The Commonwealth Government took an
ontion over the big Blythe River iron-ore
show 'Tas.) last year: but nothing was
done, and the option expired at the end of
May. As there was still a faint hone that
the Government might do something its
rights were revived and extended to August
31—without any payment, of course.
“Exile”: Tom Whaley, the Californian
oil man, who made the first reports on
likely petroleum areas in Queensland, Vic.,
N. S. Wales and New Caledonia, and who
was mendaciously rumored to have gone
west, has a profitable oil proposition in
Bakersfield (Cal.). Whaley reports that the
men who run the modern drilling plants there
think nothing of getting down 2500 feet in 60
days. He still believes that payable oil exists
in Australia and New Caledonia, though it
may mean big expenditure for drilling deep
test boreholes.

On leaving the High Court bench Chief
Justice Griffith is going back to Brisbane to
live. His old picturesque home is Merthyr,
at New Farm.
N.S.W. Supreme Court Justice Richard Sly
wears better, in the physical sense, than any
other Judge in the State. Though now with’n
four months of 70 and a pension, he has
never been able to find a grey hair on his
head. Cullen, C.J., six years his junior,
will never again be able to find anything
else. He has whitened rapidly. Pring (66)
and Ferguson (58) are well frosted.
Every State begins to put forward a can-
didate for the Chief Justiceship, which js
going to be vacant almost as soon as Hughes
gets home. Vic. thinks of the ponderous
Mitchell, beloved of the Argus. N. S. Wales
pufs forward Adrian Knox, an easy first at
the Bar in Sydney. S. Aus., passing over
its incomparable Symon as probably too old
now, suggests its wealthy bachelor Chief
Justice Murray, though without great hope
that he would put up with the inconveni-
ences. After which Hughes may tread on
precedent and call Edmund Barton higher.
The boy whom Adelaide knew as Willie
Bragg has been appointed Professor of
Physics at Manchester University. His father
came from Cambridge to be Professor of
Mathematics, married a daughter of Charles
Todd, and stayed
in S.A. till he was
one of the world’s
authorities on the
new matter of
radium; then he
felt bound to re-
move to England
(1908) to get in
touch with its
latest develop-
ments. Father and
son together were
awarded the Nobel
Prize in 1915. The
senior has lately
been a professor
at London. The
junior replaces at
Manchester Ernest
Rutherford, the
Maorilander, pro-
mo te d to Cam-
bridge.
P. LE CORNU ,
General President
of the Federated
Seamen’s Union.
The re-shuffled Holman Ministry of 12
members contains six lawyers. At any
rate, they have been called to the Bar.
When two Supreme Court Judges were
lately being selected in Victoria, Weigall,
K.C., who specialises in Equity, was ap-
proached. He declined to listen, believing
that the Bar rather than the Bench was his
job.
Chief Justice Griffith made his first appear-
ance in a big case at Rockhampton in 15(17,
when he was junior in the defence of Com-
missioner Griffin, charged with the murder
of Troopers Power and Cahill, of the Cler-
mont gold escort. It was a hopeless case,
and Griffin was duly hanged. The troopers
had about £4OOO in notes for the bank at
Clermont, and Griffin, their superior officer,
went part of the way with them, drugged
their liquor one night in camp and then
shot them. He had actually taken out some
of the notes before the packages left Rock-
hampton and paid them to Chinese diggers
who had lent him money to square gambling
losses. The Chinese were goin_g home to
China, but they missed a boat at Sydney and
were brought back as witnesses. Ten days
after Griffin had been buried his grave was
dug up and his skull was in a house in Rock-
hampton not so long ago.
Samuel Griffith got the habit of taking
the prizes of life very early. Sydney Uni.
used to award scholarships for “general
proficiency”— anything from two to half a
dozen. Griffith gained this prize in each of
his three years : the first year he was second
(the late C. B. Stephen was reckoned the
most proficient scholar that year), next
year he tied for second place with lately-
retired N. S. Wales Judge Murray, and the
third year he was at the top of the list, with
Murray second. They were equally brilliant
at mathematics; but Griffith was slightly
the better at classics. Lately-dead “Bob”
Smith (Norton, Smith and Co.) was in the
list that year, too, and led it the next year.
C. B. Stephen alone beat Griffith’s record
during the 40 years these scholarships were
given; he topped the list in each of his
three years.
John Denniston, until lately a Judge of
the Maoriland Supreme Court, who passed
over the other day, was one of the leanest
inhabitants of the Chilly Isles. He suc-
ceeded Johnston in the Canterbury circuit
in ’B9, and for the first time there Justice
was tempered with Mercy. Johnston had
been a fierce old party who seldom opened
his mouth to mention anything under 10
years. Denniston was a forbearing person
addicted to giving the poor devil in the dock
a fighting chance with 12 months. A Scot
bv birth, he migrated in youth to Dunedin,
pushed a pen in a bank and qualified to
pursue Costs. His first exploits as a bar-
rister were a few terrific rows with old
Judge Bathgate, but these were adjourned
when he married Bathgate’s daughter. A
very temperamental man and a garrulous
one, Denniston was yet a verra judeecious
Judge. His main weaknesses were haggis
and chess. The old man had been on pension
for a couple of years when pneumonia closed
the argument at 74.
August 1 will be the centenary of the birth
of A. C. Gregory, one of the most renowned
of Australian explorers. He died at Bris-
bane June 20, 1905.
Omitting Judges and officials, Mitchell,
Weigall and McArthur are the only prac-
tising King’s Counsel in Victoria. Starke is
likely to take silk towards the end of this
year, and will then have to be accompanied
by a junior. If Hughes wishes to be a
K.C. in Vic. as well as in England, it will
be necessary for him to be admitted to the
State Bar on his N. S. Wales qualifications,
and to then induce Lawson and Robinson
to pass an Order-in-Council.
Nat Gould, author of 130 or 1300 sport-
ing novels, and long ago a horsey journalist
in Australia, died in England during last
week at 62. He wasn’t a great man—
merely a busy one; but some pressman
proudly remembers that Gould the Great
once spoke io him. The little story is de-
livered reverently in Sydney D.T.: —
The man of to-day, then an office boy, collided
with Nat when passing from one room to another.
Placing a hand on the youngster’s shoulder Gould
said, “Always keep to the right, my boy, and you’ll
never go wrong.” Many such stories could be told
of him.
But surely they can’t all be as bright as
that one!
Peace with honors. Haig and Beatty get
an earldom and £lOO,OOO each.
The 80th anniversary of St. Stephen’s
Anglican Church at Penrith (N.S.W.) on
July 20 was attended by Mrs. Sarah Barlow,
who had also attended the first service in
1839. The first parson, by the way, was
sent to Sydney for taking part in the Irish
rising of ’9B.
R. G. D. Fitzgerald, M.L.C., of Muswell-
brook, completed his 50th year on the solici-
tors’ roll of N. S. Wales on July 17. He
served his articles with the late W. It.
Mullen at West Maitland. Though he never
pushed far forward in politics he represented
the Upper Hunter in the Assembly as far
back as 1885.
Died, at Perth, the last white survivor of
John Forrest’s expedition of JB7O, William
Henry Osborn. The party, which comprised
John Forrest and Alec., IJ. McLarty, W. H.
Osborn and two natives, made the journey
from Perth to Adelaide in five months.
Osborn later on became a sub inspector of
police in Westralia.
The first Rhodes scholar chosen in S. Aus.
for some years is Leonard Linden, son of a
long-dead headmaster of Queen’s School,
North Adelaide. The boy was at Geelong
College from 1905 to 1911, and had two years
afterwards at St. Peter’s in Adelaide. He
had just started the medical course when the
war began, and w-ent on active service, but
was sent back to qualify as surgeon. He
has won various scholarships, and in sport
was in all the Uni. teams, captain of the
Boat Club, and sec. of most of the others.
He is 23.
William George Finn, a young shire en-
gineer of Mudgee (N.S.W.), whom ’flu
claimed the other day, came of a well-known
Vic. literary family. His father is Eddy
Finn, one of the oldest Melbourne pressmen
still in action, and his grandfather was Ed-
mund Finn, whose pen-name “Garryoweu”
was two generations ago a household word
along the Yarra, and who left behind him
a history of his State that is of great value
to the student. Pat Finn, who died in Syd-
ney a few years back, was another journal-
istic member of the tribe.
Wearing silk gown and full-bottomed wig,
and looking almost as grand as B. R. Wise
did on that memorable day when the High
Court sat for the first time, Arthur Robin-
son, Vic. Solicitor-General, took precedence
in the Supreme Court when Justices Schutt
and Mann submitted themselves for congratu-
lation. Robinson is a solicitor, and his firm,
as a rule, contents itself with instructing
counsel, but the temptation to shine on the
special occasion was too great, to be resisted.
Lawson, Attorney-General, and Irvine, C.J.,
did not mind, and as Robinson stands pretty
well with the inner barristerial circle he
was not grudged the momentary glory. The
silk and horsehair will serve as souvenirs of
his morning out.
Gibson, who goes to the Vic. ElectriciG
Commission in place of McKinstry is the
brains of the Coal Board. Bv some he is
regarded as a commercial Sir 'Galahad • In-
others as a Machiavelli of the employin'*
class. He really is a big, just man. who is
inclined to view the world as a school with
himself as its master.
PEACE, PERFECT PEACE.
“Seems an awful waste of money, all these
decorations. But I suppose they brir-J
Peace home to us."
“You bet they do. The ‘wife’s beeh out to
see the illuminations every night this
week."
Inspecting-Superintendent W. R. David-
son has just retired from the Ydc. Police
Force on completing his 60th year. For
more than half of the 37 years he was in
the force Davidson was coroner's orderly.
It was a group of journalists who induced
J. B. Patterson, the then Premier and Chief
Sec., to give him his first promotion in 1894.
Of the 10,000 cases he handled at the
morgue (6SOO of them involved inquests)
the most notable were the victim of the boot-
box tragedy, and those done to death by
Deeming, Mrs. Knorr and Mrs. Needle.
Dr. Bevan, who died in Adelaide a year
ago, has just been anchored down in West
Terrace with a five-ton block of granite, sent
from his old home at Beaconsfield (Vic.).
Poor old parson Ronald, of Melbourne,
made application the other day for his name
to be restored to the register of ministers of
religion authorised to collect marriage fees.
One way and another Ronald, who is of the
Scotchbyterian persuasion, has paid dearly
for his lapse into politics.
Lieut.-Governor Irvine is to make Ston-
ington his official home: the Government
thought that, as it has the house on its
hands, his Deputy-Ex. might as well save it
the expense of a caretaker. The rent, with
rates, totals £l2OO a year, and the State can-
not get rid of. the place for 14 months if it
wants to. The lease is annual, but with the
proviso that six months’ notice must be given
before the beginning of the second half of the
year: and the second half of the year begins
in March.
T. R. Gray, who lias retired from the Vic.
Education Dept, after 50 years’ service as a
teacher, had Judge Wasley, the late Judge
Eagleson, Starke (barrister), Bernard
O’Dowd, Peverill (Under-Sec- of Lands) and
no end of majors and colonels among his
thousands of pupils. A big crowd of those
whom he used to chide turned up at a send-
off in his honor at Prahran Town Hall last
week. Old boys of Mount Pleasant School
(Ballarat district) were conspicuous. A few
asserted that Norman Lindsay was among
the young hopefuls with whom Gray had to
deal, but there was uncertainty on this point.
Professor Elliot Smith, just > appointed
Professor of Anatomy at London Uni., is
another capable Australian climber. Born
and brought up in Vic., he went to Britain
to specialise in anatomy. He has done good
work on Australian questions, notably the
make-up of the platypus; but no Australian
Uni. has ever got him for a chair- He also
dabbles in Egyptology, which is unusual for
an anatomist.
Jijn Long, former Labor Senator for Tas-
mania, nowadays keeps the Pastoral pub on
the Racecourse-road at Newmarket. The
place was formerly run by James Kerrigan,
and Long put up there while he sat in the
Senate. The Bulletin can’t remember any-
body who ever left his pub to enter Par-
liament and finished up as a miner.
ON A FIGHTING PATROL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Smithy reported, from Number 2 Post,
■“The click of a pick.” ’Twas the Company’s boast,
That the Boche couldn’t move, except to retire,
For we owned “No Man’s Land” right up to his
wire.
And the photograph, snapped as the birdman had
sped,
Showed a camouflaged sap with a narrow T head
Running put through a gap and most cunningly
made,
So the wily old Hun was planning a raid !
He gets us together, with promise of fun,
Just twenty picked bombers, with one Lewis gun.
Says young Mister Brown: “We’re just taking a
stroll—
The Adjutant calls it a fighting patrol.”
Then he deals us three bombs, and he tells us his
plan
Is to sneak on the sap in the form of a fan. . . .
So we work through our wire, making straight for
the goal.
You’ve your heart in your mouth on a fighting
patrol.
The wind blows towards us, near making us sick
With the stench that it brings; but the sound of
the pick
Keeps us straight on the mark, on a night black as
ink.
In foul, stinking shellholes we flounder and sink.
So, covered in mud, and all reeking with slime,
We gain our objective exactly on time.
We hear Jerry laugh, as he moves to and fro;
So we “out with the pins,” and together let go.
A crowded five seconds, all senses alert,
The din of explosions, the groans of the hurt;
We give them another; 1 crouch in a hole,
For his Emma Gees talk to the fighting patrol.
The bullets crack close, and they whistle up high,
While Verey lights blaze in a dirty black sky ;
There’s a. cobber beside me. We sink in the mire,
When the guns spit, and curse, with their long
tongues of fire.
He lies very still—doesn’t hear what I say ;
So 1 tug at his sleeve—and!' his arm comes away !
Who was he? God knows! But the bullets take
toll—
Someone’s Cobber “goes out” on a fighting patrol.

Organiser of "Strong Posts" and Member of the State Recruiting Committee to relieve
returning Australian Soldiers. Mr. Downes Johnstone speaks of Clements Tonic
as a rare and unequalled Nerve Medicine.
MR. DOWNES JOHNSTONE, in addition to being a member of the New South Wales
State Recruiting Committee, has been a leading celebrity in the Sydney Musical World
for years, and is late Lessee and Sole Proprietor of the Repertory Theatre,
Sydney. Under his direction many intellectual Repertory Plays were successfully produced!
He is now Managing Director of the Albert College of Music and Singing, King Street Sydney.
He writes of Clements Tonic thus: —
Sydney, January 31 1919.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
I am pleased to give my testimony to the wonderful benefits person-
ally derived from Clements Tonic during a serious nervous breakdown
some three years ago, which necessitated my retirement from public
life.
But with a long rest, and the aid of your splendid tonic, I completely
recovered, and I resumed my professional responsibilities and other pub-
Clements Tonic Ltd., Rozelle, N.S.W.
lie services which I have been engaged in during the war. You have my
?ermission to use this in the Australasian, International and Foreign
'ress.
I am, sirs, yours faithfully,
DOWNES JOHNSTONE.
Always keep this medicine in your house and use it. A dose at bedtime will
make you sleep and refresh you. It is a good creator of appetite. It will give
you good, pure blood. It will make you eat well, sleep well, work well. Try it.
Get it from your Chemist or Store to-day. It means Health.
It is sold throughout Australia and New Zealand.
SOCIETY
THE MAN WHO TOOK THE WRONG TURNING.
SMITHKINS: “You know, Miss Dorothea, as I was coming along here to-night I was
trying to screw up my courage to speak to your father about a little matter” —
MISS DOROTHEA (in fluttering expectation): “Ye-yes?”
SMITHKINS : “About a small account from our firm that I’m sure he must have over-
looked.”
“Stuff”: The layman, reading the report
of the Wheat Commission proceedings, was
much more astonished at the horror of
Blacket, K.C., on being accused of “bias”
by Loxton, K.C., than it was shocked at
Loxton’s conduct in levelling the charge.
But the Bar is with Blacket. The point
is entirely one of barristerial etiquette.
Never, probably, in the history of any
British Bar, and never, certainly, in the
history of the N. S. Wales Bar, has such
an accusation been hurled or heaved in
court by one junior at another, much
less by one "silk” at another. The legal
profession, like many others, subsists largely
on bluff. It would be fatal to let the out-
side public into its differences. That is why
a barrister must be courteous in court, even
to one whom he would not associate with
outside. One subtle legitimate distinction
there is, and only one. “My learned friend”
is used in reference to a fellow-barrister who
is not the speaker’s friend and who is not
desired in that capacity; “my friend” is
used in the case of one who is a friend.
The Blacket-Loxton episode was all the
queerer inasmuch as the two men are
friends, while Loxton is one of the kindest
and gentlest of characters. The affair has
reduced the Bar in Sydney to a slightly
stunned condition, which is aggravated by
Loxton’s talk of “bias in the Equity sense.”
Justice Pring said that he had never heard
of that sort of bias. Neither has anyone
else. Bias in the Equity sense is about as
convincing as Beer in the Equity sense.
“Petramos”: I put it to the Diggers.
Among the horrors of war was there ever
a more tragic spectacle than a seasick bugler
trying to blow the cook-house call?
“Dido”: Melbourne has just been discover-
ing what you and I get out of revolutions.
They are not a bit the heroic things it
expected. I saw one non-combatant come
out of a whirling scrim opposite the
Cathedral with his new green felt hat in
his hand, and a cry of mingled bitterness and
reproach upon his lip. “Look at me hat!”
he wailed. “Look at me hat, and I never
done a thing!” His hat had a gaping hole
in it about three inches long. There was
a similar cut in his head, but ho seemed
quite unconscious of that as he repeated his
pathetic wail: “Look at me hat,” and pre-
sented the damaged lid right and left for
inspection. Another victim of cut head, his
hair saturated with blood, cried disgustedly :
“And I’d just bin in to get a packet of fags!
I stepped out ; they come whirlin’ down on
me, and I got it. And I’d just bin in to
get a packet of fags!” His hand went to
his pocket. Horror lit his countenance.
“Good G—d,” he cried, “where are me fags?”
And he plunged into the vortex again, where
batons were bobbing like grasshoppers on
a summer’s day.
“Lex” calls on the British Cabinet
All sorts of people, from Dicey to Horatio Bot-
tomley, have been attacking the unbusinesslike
British Cabinet system for years, and now it is to
be reformed. Under the new arrangement it will
“consist of 12 members, while a notable feature will
be the retention of the secretariat, as developed
under the War Cabinet, enabling a record to be
taken of all deliberations and decisions.” A small
Cabinet will be no innovation. Gladstone’s usually
numbered about 15 or less, and in Pitt’s 1783
Cabinet there were only eight including himself.
Before the institution of the secretariat system,
which was regarded with horror by English Tories,
it was something in the nature of a criminal offence
for a Minister to make so much as a note during
the Cabinet proceedings. There was no reason for
this ; it just was so. And the Sovereign was barred
from attending. (There is obvious sense in this,
though it only became a tradition by the fluke that
the early Georges did not speak English.) Accord-
ingly the Prime Minister of the day had to travel
to the Sovereign and retail the proceedings by word
of mouth. Where the Sovereign and the Prime
Minister liked one another (as in the case of Vic-
toria and Disraeli) the system worked well enough:
where they didn't (as in the case of Victoria and
Gladstone) it creaked badly. Under the Lloyd George
scheme future kings of England (if there are any)
will get their Cabinet reports by messenger—pos-
sibly by registered letter. But the Cabinet still re-
mains a nominee body which is distrusted by nearly
half the House of Commons. It still works under
TOO PEACEFUL.
BRUSH : “Little hit of the Somme in 1916.

constant attack from the minority enemy. And its
members who control such highly technical services
as the Army are still liable to be drawn from the
ranks of eloquent amateu s such as Lord Haldane.
A number of Maoriland soldiers were sta-
tioned in Cologne after the Armistice. They
found the girls good to look upon and will-
ing to bury all animosities and sink grace-
fully on the chest of a good-looking warrior
with a farm in his own country. A few of the
Diggers have married maidens of the Hun
city and now want to bring them home; and
they are finding difficulties in the way. They
ought to. It was in Cologne, when the war
was young and the Hun was feeling fresh,
that the nice girls used to wait on the
wounded prisoners who passed. When a
train-load came in, sick, thirsty, crowded,
neglected and miserable, the nice girls
flocked round them with water and held it
near their lips and then threw it away and
cackled with glee. In fact, the old city and
its ladies had a name all their own long be-
fore defeat made them humble and hypocriti-
cal and subservient and caressing:—
In Koln, a town of monks and bones,
And pavements fanged with murderous stones,
And rags and hogs and hideous wenches,
I counted two-and-seventy stenches.
These Maoriland marriages make the
seventy-third.

The R.S.A. congress in Adelaide split
badly on a question of policy—whether its
officers are better or worse for being in
Parliament. When the election for president
for the coming year came on, the holder,
Col. Bolton, who is a Senator, was unexpec-
tedly displaced by Capt. Dyett, w T ho had two
votes to the good. Then some delegates
(including a chaplain) said this did not
represent the real wish of the States; and a
Tasmanian said that anyone who said he
had not voted as his State directed was a
liar; and the chaplain was not going to be
called a liar by anyone; and the Tasmanian
had only said “if” ; and in general the con-
gress behaved for half an hour like “a lot
of d—d kids,” as more than one member told
it. When it met again, after a Sunday in the
hills, the N. S. Wales delegates withdrew,
claiming that the whole proceedings were
“absolutely unconstitutional.” Blackburn,
Y.C., a member of the S.A. Assembly, and a
lawyer, announced that he had obtained a
K.C.’s opinion on the subject, which con-
firmed his own, and would at once move in
the High Court to upset the election. In
the circumstances the congress honestly de-
clined to send Dyett the usual message of
congratulation. Poor devil!” said someone,
“he doesn’t know what is hanging over him.”
And we don t know' what is hanging over
us, either,” said someone else. So an atmos-
phere of dissension and lawsuits pervaded
what should have been a practical and useful
gathering.

“Drachma”: Beware of the Japanese
graduated glass dispensing-measures, with
which the Australian
market is at present
being inundated. Al-
though these all pur-
port to be two fluid
ounce glasses (apothe-
caries’ measure) and
are marked in ounces,
drachms and minims;
it is rarely that one
can be found which
will stand the test of
comparison with one
of standard Aus-
tralian or English
make. Frequently the
Jap measures vary by
about five or Iten
minims, but a 'few
days ago I found one
which was out by as
much as 30 minims, or
half a drachm. The
effect of using an in-
accurate measure like
(his may not be
iioticeable when its
iise is confined to the
compounding of ordi-
nary mixtures, few of
which contain very
toxic constituents;
but in the making of
a sterile solution of,
say, strychnine, for
hypodermic injection,
there is considerable
danger. If we must
import these goods,
wouldn’t it be a fair
thing for the Customs to insist on every
measuring-glass being tested before being
passed?

“Digger”: “Gunner” (B. 3/7/’l9) con-
nects the officer-caste idea with efficiency. In
99 per cent, of eases an officer’s efficiency is
in inverse ratio to his caste (otherwise
swank). The pernicious part of the busi-
ness is that swank counts for more than
efficiency with other swankers. If “Gunner”
is satisfied that an officer caste is essential
in the Australian Army, he should get busy
and convert to his way of thinking the five
out of every six returning Diggers who are
not joining the Army Reserve. It will, of
course, be necessary for him to explain that
it was not the officer caste that excluded the
Diggers from all the decent hotels in Egypt;
that obliged them to travel with the nigger
on Egyptian railways; that discountenanced
any social intercourse between the Digger
and the Nq.rse, who was in some cases his

sister; that gave officers (including re-
turned duds and worse) a monopoly of
the deck space on troopships, and a thou-
sand per cent, better menu and accommoda-
tion. If “Gunner” can convince the Dig-
gers that these and hundreds of similar dis-
criminations in favor of officers are desirable
things in the Australian Army, he should,
in the interests of the Army Reserve, lose
the least possible time in doing so.

SONG OF THE CENTURIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Discourse of the moment, of various sorts,
Which newspapers foment with heated reports,
To me is as bubbles that burst in the air.
. Industrial troubles, enough and to spare.
May f igiiten my neighbor and worry his wife,
Who prattle of Labor and Capital strife,
And swell with resentment; despite their dismay,
They seek discontentment in books of to-day ;
But I, being prudent, and thoughtful, and sage,
Am ever a student of history’s page.
I turn to the stories of centuries past,
When Whigs hated Tories, and all died at last.
For topical chatter my scorn is intense —
These times will not matter a hundred years hence.
With food for reflection my mind is consoled.
The mad insurrection and riot of old ;
The flaunting of banners and gaudy displays,
The customs and manners, the misguided ways
Of mobs and inciters (the cranks and the crooks),
Discussed by the writers of time-honored books
(Whose careful conclusion, as shown in the text,
Was put to confusion the year after next),
Impart education, and teach one to think
How prognostication is waste of good ink;
How plotters a e thwarted whilst Honor holds good,
Though truth be contorted or misunderstood ;
How Fat men grow fatter who lack commonsense—
And nothing will matter a hundred years hence.
As when Legislatures to Monarchy bowed,
Old Dame Human Nature is boss of the crowd
Of vote-seeking members, now “serving” the State
By stirring the embers of malice and hate;
As when grave despatches- went straight from the
King,
And powder and patches were reckoned the thing,
And dukes, jewel-studded, made meat for the axe,
And persons were blooded for bilious attacks;
As when Newton’s motions were greeted with jeers,
And witches brewed potions from puppy-dogs’ ears,
The classes and masses have passions that rise,
And some men are asses, and some otherwise ;
Some preach bash and batter (thexr Heads being
dense)
Whilst some fawn and flatter, and sit on the fence.
Ah, most of the latter get cake on the platter:
And some save, or scatter, pounds, shillings and
pence—
But what will it matter a hundred years hence?
victoria.

“Two Pip”: Since returning to Australia
I have met many who pretend to dis-
believe that the Germans were barbarous
in war. Well- In the advance between
La Boiselle and Contalmaison the Aus-
tralians crossed a sunken road, the sides
of which had been blown in by shell-fire.
A battalion, sent to clean it out. found
under a mass of earth, stones and debris
three bodies spread-eagled face downwards
on the road. The bodies were held with
wires fastened from wrists and ankles to
stakes driven into the ground, and were
stark naked. As the" Germans would have
no reason to hide the identity of their own
men, it was patent, from the nakedness,
that the bodies were those of Allied soldiers.
It was a sight to make a coward or even
a Universal Brother fight.

“Crump”: At an Aussie camp in France
one of the officers was a major who used to
be a well-known Melbourne train-starter.
One night a shrill voice arose out of the
dark: “Train for Dan-de-nong, Koo-wee-
rup, Nyora, Korumburra and Lee-on -gatha.
Hurry on, please!” After a pause, across
the stillness there' came from the farther
side of the camp a new voice: “Train for
Berwick, Nar-nar-goon, Drouin, Traralgon.
Sale and Bairnsdale. Hurry on, please!”
The calls proceeded for a while, until drowsy
HAD HEARD OF IT.
FORTUNE TELLER : “You will discover a
hurled treasure.”
MR. HENPECK ( resignedly ): “Yes, I know;
it’s my wife’s first husband.”
Diggers had cursed the interrupters into
silence. Next night the thing started again ;
and this time the opening item was followed
by the loud jangling of a bell, dug up during
the daytime in the village near by. That
caused a roar even from the drowsy ones.
The major concerned, being a dinkurn Dig-
ger. took the matter right; and there were
Billjims who swore they dreamed those
nights of getting off at Gibblegobble or
Boggy Flat and going home to a square feed
of corned beef and cabbage. *-

“Gferardy”: To see the Gyppo at his fil-
thiest you must visit a fellaheen village in
one of the upper provinces. The native
rural worker, after his healthful toil in
the open fields, sleeps at night in his work-
ing clothes with his reeking family in a
squalid hatching-bed of disease. A village
of 8000 inhabitants invariably covers less
than 200 acres. Typhus is a frequent visi-
tor. Slops and offal are slung to the dogs
which haunt the sordid, alleyways, lice and
fleas infest the unswept mud hoVels, rats
are everywhere, aind flies swarm untroubiea
on the unwashed faces of diseased children,

A lately-home Australian brought from
N’York a sheaf of circulars and placards
issued by swell clubs for the restraint of
the jazzer. The South Shore Country Club,
for instance, directed
members’ attention to
the rule which pro-
hibits dancing head to
head or cheek to cheek.
And N’York, which is
prepared to put up with
a good deal, is repress-
ing the woman who
smokes in public. A
lively girl graduate told
the homing Australian
that she hadn’t a girl
friend who smoked. The
public cigarette is the
trademark of the fast'
cat. The girl may smoke,
after she’s married,
perhaps; but even then
she must blow her cloud
up the family chimney
—if the family owns a
chimney, which it prob-
ably doesn’t. So it
isn’t astonishing to find
the South Shore Club
adding to its veto on cheek-to-cheek dancing
a rule that prohibits “smoking by women
in any public room of the club or on the
grounds.”

Labor M.L.A. Murphy, of Port Melbourne,
without waiting for the Liberal majority in
the Assembly to act on the advice of the
Fish Commission, is about to push forward
a bill empowering the municipalities to re-
tail from barrows at fair rates, instead of
leaving the spoil to be divided between the
Dago and the garbage-tip. Fish are now at
least as plentiful in Victorian waters as they
were 20 years ago, when a hefty ’eouta could
be bought for sixpence. Handling facilities
have greatly improved since then, the clean-
ing and ice-packing of catches now .being
miles ahead of what they used to be ; yet the
trade has gone into the hands of a few.
Two men are said to control the crayfish-
trade ; and a fresh whiting now sells off the
marble slab at about the price that one of
equal weight can be bought, fried-and-
battered and with parsley on its nose, at
certain restaurants. If Murphy can get
Liberalism to state its real objections to
the direct sale of fish, he will have done
something to bring the cheap-food problem
nearer solution.

Sydney Eight Hours Demonstration com-

But the Sydney Eight
Hours Committee, which,
besides controlling the
Sydney, beanfast, is the
parent of similar bodies
in country towns, says
“No.” Delegates go from
the Sydney committee to
represent that body in
country celebrations; and
these jaunts are nice
little limelit picnics which
are not to be missed.
The war has pretty
nearly destroyed Conven-
tion. Consider the case
of one hitherto irre-
proachably austere dame.
Before the war she would
spend an hour at the
printer’s hesitating about
the most correct form of
pasteboard to us@ for in-
vitation purposes. N)t
once but many tisles did
she hold up her hands in
horror at the slap-dash
modern method of ’pho-
ning guests for a dinner
or dance. Now behold
the metamorphosis! She
wanted to postpone a
party recently. “I wonder,” she mused, “if
I’ll just put a little advertisement in the
Herald of the change of date.”

A Melbourne couple have just served the
shortest sentence on record. The Law in
its wisdom decided to interfere with the
married bliss of George Williams, 23, and
Emily Williams, 17, and they were brought
before the Criminal Court. The husband
was charged with having married a minor
without the written consent of her parents,
and the wife was charged with having made
false statements. Both pleaded guilty. But
Justice Cussen could see no good in gaoling
the youngsters. “Imprisonment till the
rising of the Court” he said ; and (vacating
his chair) “the Court will now rise.”

The Censor, who has been fading for the
past nine months, withered on the stalk last
week. In death he desires nothing but to
be forgotten, wherefore recently he appealed
for the return of all the instructions he had
issued. That could hardly have been done
in the interests of the “National” Govern-
ment, because, as a matter of fact, the
Censorship was most virulent in the days
of the Labor Government; but it may have
been in the interests of Pearce, who was
the responsible Minister throughout. As
usual under Pearce’s administration, the re-
sults were liable to be humorous when they
weren’t tragical. For instance, there was
the occasion when The Bulletin got a hint
from Treasurer Higgs that a bit of help for
his projected tax on war-profits would help
the Government to win the war. As The
Bulletin wanted to help Higgs win the
war, it printed a cartoon on the suggested
lines —to be promptly informed by Higgs’s
colleague Pearce that it was a contravention
of instruction 296541 to suggest that any-
body was making a profit out of the war.
Still, that cartoon was published, so it had
better luck than one which had to be sup-
pressed because it suggested that Uncle Sam
was making a bit of money, too. (This, one,
by the way, was almost the last that
Alf Vincent did for The Bulletin.) Per-
haps the Censor’s finest achievement, though,
was when he suppressed some Povertv Point
verses intended to give Lawson’s ’“While
the Billy Boils” when it was dramatised
and staged in Sydney. The other Billy
was boiling furiously at this time, and the
verses about ‘Lawson’s billy were knocked
out on the ground that they might be taken to
THE VILLAGE GOSS IF.

me why you did no ! give my note to

b& a reflection oil' Hughes. After that Holman
took a hand, and, with Fuller, refused to
be associated with Hughes in the Conscrip-
tion Campaign unless the political censor-
ship was abolished. Billy (the one that
Lawson wasn’t guilty of) climbed down;
and it became allowable even to call Pearce
“futile” —an adjective that had once been
knocked out of a Bulletin proof.

“Mr. Ocky”: Gne day in England, whilst
waiting for the transport to return us to
Australia, we got the order to line up and
hand in our hair-combs. (We had each been
issued with one by the military a few years
before.) We collected all the old, unwanted
relics, broke them each into four or six
pieces; each man handed in a piece; and
everybody seemed quite satisfied.

“E.J.C.”: Those Rising Suns cut in the
chalk by the Diggers on the hills of Wilt-
shire (B. 17/7/’l9) will be places of pil-
grimage to Australians in the years to come
and a source of income to the owners. Yet
the latter, being typical English landlords,
threatened to sue the A.I.F. authorities for
“damage to property,” and the military
paid up. One decoration near Codford cost
Australia £5OO. English landlords are
mostly a bowel-less lot. Heytesbury railway-
station was on Lady Heytesbury\s property,
and adjoined the A.I.F. artillery camp.
The village lay between the station and the
Heytesbury mansion, and the townspeople
used the station. But *the lady declined to
allow it to be used by troops, who had to
be detrained at' either Warminster or Cod-
ford, each about three and a half miles
away. Propputy being sacred in England,
the War Office took it like a lamb, and the
A.I.F. had even, to provide M.P.’s to guard
the station we couldn’t use. But it meant
many a pound for engine-drivers, who would
slow down outside the village and give re-
turning Diggers a chance to jump.
Lady Plunket, a sister of Lady Helen
Munro Ferguson and wife of the ex-Gover-
nor of Maoriland, has started a day nursery
in London, for the benefit in particular of
women who have to earn their living and
cannot take their children with them and
have no responsible person to leave them
with. One of the daughters is acting as
matron; she is very young, but has had war-
hospital experience. The nursery is Palled
after Lord Basil Blackwood, that brother of
the wife of our G.-G. who was killed "in the’
war. A private cable lias brought the news
of the death from meningitis of the youngest
daughter of the Plunkets, a niece of' Lady
Helen, whom she resembled a good deal in
looks. She was only 12.

“I thought they called it the ‘Silent
Navy/ ” said the ingenuous maiden to the
“lent” R.N. officer, pointing to the columns
of social and other information regarding
the wardroom personnel with which her
Sabbath-day journal was garnished. Non-
plussed, the hero gazed at the photographs,
reminiscences, life-stories, and countless
snappy details of his confreres. ‘(Oh, that.”
he said explanatorily, “is the other Navy.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dear, we have spent some golden hours;
Still may we spend the few
Within the limits of our powers;
When all those have their due
Whose teasing bills will never end,
We've nothing else of gold to spend.
Life is a round of rent and bills ;
Love needs a home, and that
Means landlords, and the other ills
That wear the household mat.
With such a cause for discontent,
Small wonder that our love-dream’s rent.
The heavier blows earth gives we bear
And scarcely feel at all;
The things that vex us, here and there,
Are trivial and small:
’Tis easier to gladly .die
Than do the washing, bake or fry.
For my part, 1 would die with ease
If it would do you good ;
Or if a gaudy star would please
I’d reach it, if I could ;
But, still, I frown when cash you seek ,
For one bill twice within a week.
I know the sacrifices you
Would make —indeed, have made ;
Yet there are sundry details due,
To mention I’m afraid
Lest such small, petty things may hurt—>
I want a button on my shirt.
The greater things we both can face:
’Tfs little things that start
The angry storms that swiftly chase
All love-thoughts from the heart;
So let us think when tempest glowers,
Dear, we have spent some golden hours.

Frank Young and Co., shearing con-
tractors, -recently got particulars of what is re-
garded as a record in tallies, put up by
12 shearers, on one of their Westralian contracts.
The dozen started on a mob of 59,606 sheep
on April 3, and cut out on May 16. The
total hours worked were 2291. The highest in-
dividual day’s tally was made on April 29, when
the 12 shore 2954 sheep, an average of 246.016 per
man. Actual working time seven hours. The in-
dividual tallies for that day were as follow: —
Sawallish, 321; Munro, 253; Ryan, 158; Woodall,
262; Lehman, 236; Brooks, 282 ; Brown, 246 ;
Mitchell, 245; McLeod, 239 ; Slade, 233 ; Saltmarsh,
258 ; Yeing, 211. This performance of Sawallish
equals, or betters, that of famous Jack Howe, who
shore 321 at Alipe Downs in Queensland some years
ago. On that occasion Howe worked eight hours.
The 12 barbers earned £849 7s. 6d., or an average
of £70 15s. 8d. per man net, in 38 days, including,
five days’ lost time occasioned through wet weather.
“Barcoo” : The chase after Tom Carr, who
appropriated SO head of horses from near Lake
Oudgelico (tf.S.W.) in the early ’seventies, was a.
long one. The nags were a valuable lot in those
days, being by Caliph, the first thoroughbred
English sire imported into the Lachlan district.
The party which set out in pursuit was O’Sullivan,
owner of the mob; Cavan, a mounted trooper; and
a black-tracker. Th e thief had got
about a fortnight’s start before *he
animals were missed. He had headed
direct for the Queensland border,
which he crossed near Mungindi,
making then on to the Maranoa. The
pursuers here were at fault for a time
owing to their guest having debouched
further west on to the Warrego.
Eventually they got on to the scent
again, and found' that their man Was
making down that river, owing prob-
ably to the fact that ahead of him
he would have had to face bad
droughty conditions. So he hung to
the watercourse till he got on, to .he
Darling. Here the men behind began
to close on to their quarry, and a
few miles from Wilcannia, in a river
bend, the looked-for horses were found
feeding. Carr had gone into the
town for the day to spy out the
land, and probably to arrange for che
disposal of the animals. He was sen-
tenced to 10 years’ hard, but did not
serve his time, breaking gaol after
serving nearly two years. He escaped,
but gave himself up 12 years after-
wards. During 10 years of that period he had
charge of one of the large cattle ranches of Banana-
land.

“B.B.”: Gone to join the tribe in the
Shadows, the aged blackfellow known as William
Collis, king of the Wellington (N.S.W.) aborigines.
He was the last of the full-blooded Macquarie tribe,
and maybe was considerably older than the age he
credited to himself—B2. For over 50 years he had
lived in the Wellington district.

“Te Whare”: South Coast (N.S.W.)
sleeper-cutters come upon the big black, or “magpie,”
squiirel occasionally in felling tall stringy-bark or
box-trees. The animal develops to about 2ft. in
length and is nocturnal in habit. When it has
any remark to make it does so in a loud, whirring
scream. The fur is verjr dark brown, edged
broadly with white, but is not nearly so fine as
that of the little grey sugar-squirrel, which is up-
holstered in material resembling chinchilla. I have
occasionally seen the magpie-squirrel’s skin, stretched
to about 2ft. square, pegged out on the slabs of
bush shanties in South Coast forests; but the beast
is far from common.
NO SPOIL-SPORT.
BOBBY (collecting information) : “Did you see him hanging?”
COCKY: “I did.”
BOBBY: “Well, why the devil didn’t you cut him down?”
COCKY: “Oh, he wasn’t dead then.”
“Melos” : The manager of Yandah station
was the largest-hearted fellow I ever met. On the
death of an abo. stockman he offered to educate the
three orphaned pics, and find employment for their
mother. Pie said, in fact, that he would be a
father to the youngsters. “When he married, some
time later, the gin was among the crowd assembled
at the welcome home. Approaching the young
wife she remarked with much force: “By cripes,
missus, you gotten! good boss! Ilim bin father
longa all my chil’ren!”
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: During the annual cluck
slaughter in Victoria there is one of the family,
the sheldrake or mountain-duck, that escapes most
of the shrapnel. The bird is not considered worth
eating, so it is left alone. Consequently this beauti-
fully plumagcd duck is on the increase. The fox
is its chief enemy,'and many a clutch ends its
days inside the imported pest. The sheldrakes build
in hollow trees, often a mile or more from water,
and it is a treat to see them pilot the babies across
country to the pools. On the least sign of danger
there is a “honk” and the youngsters have disap-
peared in tussocks, grass or anything handy, while
the old birds clear out from the spot as if they
never owned a family in their lives. If you wish
to witness a real good fight, watch the collision that
occurs when a strange male of the species encroaches
cn another pair’s water frontage! Two motors
grappling in a swamp couldn’t “honk” or splash as
much.
* * * *
“Mrs. Lance Rawson” : In 1859 I saw a
corroboree at Stockton (opposite Newcastle) in which
theVe were considerably over 100 blacks, exclusive of
gins and piccaninnies. Old King Timmy was boss of
that district. lie was a fine old man, who wore
with great pride a brass-plate that had been pre-
sented to him by Captain Caswell, of Ballaeara.
Aborigines came to the gathering from Port Stephens,
Stroud, Raymond Terrace, and no doubt from the
Maitland side too. The corroboree was held where
the ground was level and there was plenty of room.
The scene was no doubt grotesque, but to my childish
eyes it was wonderfully grand. The fires, the gins
seated at the back of the painted men (who looked
like skeletons, every rib outlined with pipeclay, circles
round the eyes and mouth, luminous stuck
in their ears and hair, and, of course, all perfectly
naked except for the “shingle” or loin-cloth) —it was
a sight for men and gods to wonder at. We children
might have been scared, but for days we had watched
the preparations and rehearsals, and even assisted
when the gins- asked us for “little bit blue” or “you
gettem red paint.” We gave all we could, and more
than we should. I contributed an ostrich feather
from my own hat, and one of the men wore it with
striking effect. It was a most impressive scene
when the painted abos. capered and danced through
weird figures, all of which had a meaning for those
who were taking part, and all the while the gins
kept up a monotonous sing-song that was not at all
unpleasing. As they sang, or rather hummed (for it
was more that than any articulate song), they beat
their legs in a peculiar way that produced the 1 sound
of drums. It was all in perfect time, as were the
steps and tramping of the men. .That was the
biggest and most important corroboree I ever saw.
Most of the men, I might say almost all, were young
and untainted by drink and civilisation. But that
was a long time ago, and we have “civilised” them
since then. I hold no brief for the blackfellow, and
1 have no cause to love him, but I do know that he
never committed an outrage that, was not justified by
what had happened to him.
BUT WHERE IS HIS TAIL?
PARSON SKINNER: “Ah, my boys, Satan is
always speaking to you to tempt you;
he talks to you while you are at your
lessons, and at your play; and every
minute of the day and night he is whis-
pering to you; he is talking to you even
now!”
“M.A.T.”: When your pipe gets too
strong pack the bowl and stem tightly with young
green grass and put it aside for a month. When
you light up after the spell you'll be glad I was
born.

DISMAL JIM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We each seek out the things we most enjoy;
Some quest adventure, deeds of which to boast;
Some keep the jolly laughter of a boy,
And some nurse grief because it pleases most.
And when I heard the tale of Dismal Jim
This truth remained with me a firm belief.
A brooding sorrow was a joy to him,
For he was happy in a ’life of grief.
’Twas Tom Long told me; “This here Jimmy was
A chap who loved to lose a full day’s pay,
And nark his wife, who had the worst of jaws,
For every funeral that came his way.
“His wife would rouse about it —she was just
The rousin’ sort; but, as old Jim would tell,
About each rumpus, he would nearly bust
With pleasure when he said his life was hell.
“He was the queerest cove a man could know.
I mind me once how in a pleased, sad way
He said his aunt was drowned, and he must go
Down to the Morgue to Spend his holiday.
“His second wife she was, the one that raved.
The first was pleasant as a man could own.
Cheerful she was—she cleaned and laughed and
saved ;
At every virtue Dismal Jim would groan.
“’Course, when she died, he made the best of that,
Talking of all he’d lost; how death was cruel,
But life was crueller—that was all his chat;
He sorter revelled as he took his gruel.
“lie had a mate was dying for a year.
He loved to tell you poor Bill’s case was sad,
Talk of the agonies he had to bear
And give him pity for the wife he had.
“She was the limit of all super-shrews,
Who had to nag, though Death was lurking near ;
And Jim would glory in the latest news
He had of what poor Bill had got to bear.
“When poor Bill died, of course he felt the 1055....
That’s him- —the bloke what’s standing by she
shelf—
HOW IT HAPPENED.
UNCLE WILLIAM: “Why, Johnnie, what’s
the matter with your head? Been fight-
ing again?”
JOHNNIE: “ Fighting? Me! ’Course not! It
was an accident. I got Billy Jones
down, an’ was sitting on him, and for-
got to hold his feet.”
The one who's said a man must bear his cross ;
That’s Dismal Jim, enjoying of himself 1
“He’s had a funeral; and in a race
His horse ran second; and he’s had a fight;
And lost his pay, and has his wife to face—
’Struth, he’s as pleased as punch with things to-
night !
“Well, Jim's mate, dying, left his cares behind,
And Jim lost lots of pleasure from his life,
Until he struck the way new joys to find—
Within a month he wed Bill’s nagging wife!”

“Bill Bowyang”: Dave Black (N.Q.) was
the best buck,jump rider Bananaland ever produced,
and I’ve seen most of the pigskin cracks up that
way during the past 30 years. Lance Skuthorpe
was a good runner-up, but I won’t have it that
Billy Waite was anything more than a circus-riding
horseman. 1 knew Waite on Breadalbane station
(N.Q.) when lie was a boy. Later on, when the
Boer War started, he secured a job breaking in le-
mounts at the old Police Camp near Bowen. As
every second horse managed to throw him out of
the saddle he lasted only a week. His chance of
slipping into the limelight came when Martini’s
buckjumping show visited Proserpine. The star item
on the programme was Bargain's Grey, an outlaw
who was supposed to have been ridden only once,
and then by Harry Morant (“The Breaker”). Waite
did not ride the prad, but the show was .short of
horsemen, and he was offered a job. Billy Emmer-
son, a fine horseman,, also joined the show, but he
was too heavy for circus work, and only remained
with Martini until he reached Ingham. Waite cer-
tainly gave some wonderful exhibitions of riding on
the celebrated Bobs, but he knew the horse and its
way, which was more than the stranger did who
accepted the invitation to step into the ring and
master the outlaw. Dave Black was no show rider,
and it didn’t matter to him if lie rode a horse in
a yard or open country. For many years Love, the
Indian horse-buyer at Townsville, offered £100 to
anyone who could give a better exhibition of horse-
manship than Black, but there were no seekers after
the cash. The last I heard of Black he was break-
ing in remounts for the army in S’Africa, whilst
Billy Waite was on similar work in Canada.

“Sandfly”: Collect a tenner for me from
“A. Sinclair” (B. 22/5/’l9) and “Cycle” (B.
24/4/ 19) for this recipe for schooling or droving
wild or any other pigs. After catching and stying
them feed them for a week or two on molasses two
or three times daily. They’d go to Hell for
molasses. On the morning of departure put a bag
of maize and some molasses into a cart, sprinkle
some about the yards, and start off in front of the
mob,. scattering a little corn here and there and an
occasional drop of treacle Give them a long day,
BLOOD RELATIONS.
B ILLO: “See that bloke just none past?
You'd never think it, but 'im an' me
wus 'it by the same shell at Pozzy; an’
now 'e wants to make out 'e never met
me."
and before pitching camp catch one of them, tie
him by the leg to a tree, and let the rest go for
the night. Don’t worry about them; they won’t
stray more than a quarter of a mile away. Next
morning get ready to start at daybreak, and after
the captive piggy has finished his breakfast get to
him with a switch and belt sparks out of him. In
five minutes every pig will be present in response
to the screaming appeals for help. Get busy with
the molasses and corn, and move off again.
EXCELLENT PROGRESS.
REV. SNICKERS: "And your aaughter, Mrs. Bunks—the one that was going in for
nursing—how is she? Well, I hope?"
MRS. BUNKS: “Splendid, thank you, sir. Last we 'eard from 'er she was goin' up
for 'er final contaminations."
“Old Bill”: All the casual Australians
didn’t parade in France. This bloke was busy on
his selection up north when a sympathetic friend
rushed up to him with the news that his brother
had been drowned. “Which . one, Jack or Bill?”
inquired cocky. “Bill,” was the answer. “Hard
luck for Bill,” said cocky, and went on with the
milking.
“Dopey” : A. B. Piddington, K.C., may be a
good lawyer and a good chairman of the Inter-
State Commission, but he talked without his brief
when he described scab in sheep as one of the
problems of the Australian pastoral industry. Scab
has been extinct in Australia for nearly half a
century. There are still some greybeards at the
game who can remember when sheep used *to be
put through a tobacco dip to kill scab and when
persistently scabby animals were killed and burnt.
But nowadays Pid might as well talk about the
danger of being bitten by dingoes outside his
office in East Melbourne.
* * * *
“Melos”; Why the wattle-bird and snipe
have been black-listed under the N. S. Wales Birds
Protection Act is beyond guessing. The former
especially is a valuable chook, as it destroys
cicadas, whose larvae live on the roots of trees.
Its dietary is the same as that of the other honey-
eaters, barring the garrulous or noisy mina and
friars. By subsisting on insects and worms the
beautiful painted snipe and the long-billed species
render some service to the landowner; but the
protected, fish-devouring ducks need not be seriously
considered as helps. The ducks certainly add pond
snail to their repast of immature mullet, but the
quantity does not compensate for the loss of our
fish. At any rate, we have in the magpie-lark a
much more efficient snail-hunter and one whose
services are rendered gratuitously.
* * * *
“Australian”: I agree with “Azac” (B.
12/6/’l9) in regard to weather cycles, but I think
it will be found that the “fives” are dry winters
only in two succeeding cycles of ten, and dry
through the year in a third cycle. Such has been the
N. S. Wales North Coast experience. In other words,
the real cycle is 30 years, made up of three 10’s.
For example, 1888-89 has its counterpart in 1918-
19. Another fact worth mentioning is that every
bad drought has been followed by a magnificent
spring. . The worse the preceding drought the better
the spring (1902-03, for instance), and every such
spring by a very wet summer, especially if in cul-
minating periods of wet seasons, as 1756-63, 1826-
33, 1886-93. We have recently passed through a
very bad “eight” and a very bad “five,” and the
next series of “eights” and “fives” will probably
prove mild dry spells, similar to 1895 and 1898.
Our very bad “two” was 1902. The next bad one
should fall in 1932. Reasoning from the above, we
should be now on the verge of better seasons than
we have had for 30 years past. To show the re-
markable parallelism between 1889 and 1919: A
diary kept by a stockbreeder in this locality (South
Grafton, N.S.W.) discloses the fact that the tem-
perature on January 25, 1889, was 106 deg., and
the first frost occurred on June 18. The records of
this year show that the temperature was identical
on the same date, and the first frost arrived June
17. Also the drought of 1888-89 broke at the end
of February, the same as it did this year. I chal-
lenge anyone to prove that we on the North Coast
have ever had a bad spring in a “six,” a “three,”
or a “nought” year, that we have ever had a good
winter in a “five,” or a good season in an “eight”
or a “two.” 1812 drove Blaxland and party to
their venture across the Blue Mountains,
while 1842 caused an exodus of stockowners from
the Hunter to the New England tableland and else-
where. 1828 dried up Oxley’s reeds in his
supposed inland sea (aided, of course, by a preceding
bad “five”). Very wet years succeed a very bad
“five” and a very bad “eight” coming together,
and from then onward there is a period of fair
average seasons, which peter out, and are at last
succeeded by a very bad “two.” The bad “fives”
are apparently caused by a weakening of Antarctic
influences for .two periods, and at the third by a
failure of both Antarctic and monsoonal rains. On
the other hand, the bad “eights” and “twos” are
caused by a weak monsoon in each of the milder
periods, and by a failure of both monsoonal and
Arctic influences in the very bad period.
“FY7” : The wedge-tailed eagle must have
changed his habits if, as “Azac” savs, evidence
shows that he preys on rabbits and rats and onlv
occasionally attacks lambs. When I was on a Barege
station the big chap was very plentiful. Any morn-
ing in the lambing season you could see 20 or 30
"up,” as the flying men say, over country where
the ewes were running. Though kangaroo-rats, hi-
staple native food, were as plentiful as peas, the
noble fowl specialised in lamb at such limes and
caused heavy losses. We paid ss. for a set of claws,
and as the eagle is a confirmed carrion-eater a
poisoned sheep or beast would often pay a hand-
some divvy to boundary-riders. The last of these
“fine specimens” to be “indiscriminately murdered”
by the writer died on the St. George-Noondoo road
(Q,). He had been dining off a dead swaggie who
had dropped on the track. The fowl had done him-
self so well that he wouldn’t shift from his perch
on a near-by tree till a Winchester bullet helped
him.
* * * *
“Cowpuncher”: Strawberry’s teats were
very sore and she had just succeeded in kicking me
and my bucket 11 yards when the old hand came
along. On learning that it was sore teats that were
the trouble he said that if his remedy failed he
would eat the bails. Dissolve one tablespoonful of
treacle in about four ounces of boiling water; let
it cool off, and before you start to milk rub the
teats from top to bottom ; also apply when finished.
I used it, and the old hand didn’t have to eat the
bails. The sore teats were well within a week.
“Gouger” : Being short of meat the other
day I shot a wallaby and found that the unllpky
lady had two young ones, twins, exactly the same
size. Have frequently shot marsupials with a young
one in the pouch and a very young one on the
teat, but this is the first set of twins I’ve met.
* * * #
“Oaloola” : Here’s the most reliable bush
remedy for swellings, bruises and painful joints.
Cut about 21b. of green marsh-mallows and stow
the stuff in a can containing about a quart of water.
Place on a slow fire, simmer for half an hour and
use the mess as a poultice. Saw- big Ned Clark,
the “gun” shearer, sprain his hand one day last
year while arguing with a merino ram, and before
half an hour his paw was swollen and black. That
night someone induced him to try the marsh-mallow
cure, with the result that he was back at his stand
after dinner the next day.
* * * *
“D.F.”: In speaking of the big forester
kangaroo, now very nearly extinct in the Speck,
G. T. Lloyd deposes that he measured several
successive leaps “on a slight declivity,” and fourd
them to average 30 feet each, although the hopper
had to rise five or six feet each time to clear dead
trees and limbs. Lloyd came to V.D.L. as a boy,
in 1820, with his uncle, Lieut. Jeffreys, and lived
for years at Frogmore, near Sorell, so that. he had
plenty of chances of studying the animal. But
his book has other yarns that are hard to swallow.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: Re galloping brumbies (B.
19/6/’l9), I, who know, declare that the fastest of
them can’t get away from any well-ridden horse
that is speedy enough to win a hack race at a
country meeting. Twenty years ago I was in a
hunt at Larbert, near Braidwood (N.S.W.), and I
saw Bill Bassingthwaite, mounted on a long Scamp
mare, and going at a swinging canter, head and
wheel the mob half a dozen times on the flats near
Arnprior, the old home of the Ryries. Without
much fast riding we drove the lot into a five-rail
yard; but they jumped out at the other side, and
away to the mountains. They can jumr> all right,
and therein lies their safety. As for' these wild
mokes “skimming” over the morasses, that is all
my eye. Some of the morasses would bog a turkey.
What beats me, and it beats all the bushies I
know, is how these wild neddies, full of grass and
greenstuff, can tire out domesticated mokes fed on
corn and oats and other provender that makes for
endurance. Can anybody explain it?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young widow White of Waterford
But lightly stocked her pastures broad,
So when a Slender season came
It did not disconcert the dame.
Although her cows were thin ar.d weak,
Her poddy calves were fat and sleek —
So fat, indeed, the settlers said
’Twas certain they were overfed.
When parson Worboys went that way,
At her abode he made a stay
A night or two. (Now be it known
The widow had a chaperon.)
A drought was in the land, and fire
Came on its heels with havoc dire;
And Worboys had to wait the while
At her substantial domicile.
Then came a letter from his chief.
This wise it ran: “It gives me grief
To ask the cause of this delay—
Of course I’ve heard what gossips say.”
So Worboys wrote a swift reply
Explaining full the reason why;
And added what he thought would please—
It chilled the bishop’s pious knees —
A postscript thus: “My lord, each day
I think of what you often say:
Though clouds are gathered, dark and drear,
The silver ray is somewhere near.
“’Tis truly said all flesh is grass;
All things of earth too quickly pass:
Where fatness was, a leanness preys,
And settlers mourn the meatless clays,
“Here at the widow’s home I find
A cheering ray the cloud behind
That gives the fainting spirit wings
To rise above earth’s common things.
“The widow’s faith has rightly earned
Abundant blessing’s; be it learned
Unscathed by fire her acres wide,
Though ravished is the Countryside.
“I thank kind Providence for this

Though tyrant Drought the country starves
The widow still has beefy calves.”

A Plain
Fact!
moment: he then contemplated slaying the
Queen’s Representative—but didn’t. And
his Objectcellency wouldn’t have been
missed except by people who wouldn’t have
been missed either.
Arthur Palmer, a big political figure for
many years, is credited with a kind heart,
which is straining a point. The rum of
human kindness wasn’t in Palmer. He was
five times Acting-Governor, and in that
capacity he once told the visitors at a Gov-
ernment House ball what he thought of
them—or some of them—until he was pulled
down by the coat-tails. Certain people had
left before the great patriot had a chance to
“prop-p-posh ’clth Grashus Mashesty,”
and his remarks on the subject were bul-
locky. Palmer certainly had a reputation
for courage, but even that was damaged
when a company official, who had been called
before the Board so that director Palmer
might open his heart and his whole soul to
him, told the potentate frankly that he
hadn’t the manners of a hog. It is said that
the official’s salary was raised in the con-
fusion.
Bernays alludes twice to the unpleasant
remark that Patrick Perkins made to Groom
when the latter was appointed Speaker, but
leaves out the remark, which is as well. He
states, however, quite needlessly, that the
scene reflected no credit on Perkins. No-
thing that could happen was likely to reflect
much credit on the big embittered brewer.
Another person who requires much bowdler-
ising is John Hoolan, “the blood-drinker.”
The performance with which he expressed
his derision of Parliament when leaving
under suspension is only hinted at, but it
was comprehensive. Hoolan was a news-
paper proprietor inasmuch as he owned a rag
in the crocodile country. It was up that way
that a leading article once started “Glad-
stone and Hoolan have resigned,” and lam-
ented that an empire’s misfortunes never
came singly. .Tack Annear, who said, “Hi
ham the Standing Horders,” flits across the
page. He was a sort of Thomas Bent with-
out that wonderful man’s stomach, or inhu-
man vitality or capacity for being found in
possession of other people’s money. The enor-
mous Premier George Thorn is mentioned,
though the end of his career is not. The
unhappy finish of Andy Dawson is left un-
sflid.. Also the calamity of John Douglas’s
life is slurred over. There is a justly keen
aopreciation of Mcllwraith, who looked a
great man in his day, and looks even greater
after his death, which is an unusual thing.
The one fact that he saw the Hun danger in
the Pacific fully 30 years ahead, and took
heroic measures to keep Hans Hun away
from the Australian coasts, puts him in the
front rank of Australia’s public men. Pos-
sibly Bernays under-rates Morehead, who
was Premier and many other things. More-
head bore the Scotch front names of Boyd
Dunlop, and was head of a profoundly
serious mercantile business. Yet he never
said a serious thing in his life; and, though
he had the semblance of an overgrown school-
boy combined with a large friendly dog, he
did few foolish ones and no mean ones. Sam-
uel Walker Griffith stalks through the pages,
of course. Griffith was the supreme, over-
whelming stalker of Australian politics. He
looked wiser than any man could be. He
talked with wisdom. He was cold like one
whose brain was in the upper air. He was
a master of tactics. He knew everything,
and if there had been anything else he would
have known that also. He would permit
the raising of his own salary as if lie was
conferring a favor, and could change sides
on any question and be right both times.
Some people suspected him of political prin-
ciples, aud he was regarded variously as an
icicle, a mystery, an anomaly, a monument
and a calamity. A faiiily numerous lynching
committee proposed to hang him on a lamp-
post if the “Hopeful” prisoners weren’t re-
prieved, though Bernays doesn’t mention this.
They were reprieved almost at the last
moment.
Of the _ existing Government the book
speaks politely. The private records of its
members are not dug up. The Bill for re-
(hieing the voting age to 18 and turning the
school-kid elector loose on the land receives
only a line. The oft-told story or lie about
the reason why Queensland pubs have no
caily closing is not alluded to. The wonder-
ful railway finances and Ryan’s recent heroic
loan pioposal for £9,847,327 in one act are
not so much as called remarkable. A live dog
is better than a dead lion, and Ryan is very
much alive, though he isn’t a dog-—only dog-
matic and a schoolmaster.
Incidentally, Bernays reminds us that Pre-
mier Charles Lilley, a less frozen Griffith,
and greater in some ways, began public own-
ership of steamers in Australia 50 years
ago b.v getting the Governor Blackall built
at Sydney; that Queensland was the first
colony on record which possessed a full-
blown Parliament from the beginning; and
that very early in its career it was afflicted
with a presentation copy of Victoria’s
“Leaves from the Jotirnal of Our Life in the
Highlands.” He tries to describe Vincent
Bernard Joseph Lesina, M.L.A., but the at-
tempt is a failure, for Lesina was indescrib-
able, ana it is a case of taking down a geyser
in shorthand. He reckons the pavement was
not wide enough to accommodate Kidston in
his day of greatness, which rather suggests
that the pavements should be widened than
that Kidston should be reduced. And he
classes William Guy Higgs as a humorist
Many good qualities have been ascribed 10
Higgs both by friends and enemies, but sel-
dom this.
The book includes a record of every im-
portant legislative act in Queensland' from
the beginning, which makes it a valuable
work of reference.
A Satchel of Books
Brief Poems, by E. A. Visiak (Elkin Mathews,
London). These are very short flights in verse of
no particular quality. The writer occasionally falls
down, but never rises to any height; and there are
no memorable lines.
Blight, by M. Fulton (Duckworth, London). A
well-written and interesting book on the problem of
motherhood. Grace, after typewriting for Baird and
being in love with him, marries her second employer,
old Sir Peter Wren. As she cannot have a child
she goes back to her former lover. In the meantime
Baird has married Elsie, who, through refusing to be
a mother, is crippled for life. The characterisation
and the handling of the narrative are better than
the plot.
Kenneth Dugdale, by A. S. Turberville (Methuen,
London). This is a war story of a striking and in-
teresting sort, but depending for plot on a bit of
melodrama which doesn’t quite convince. A coward
Y.C., shot conveniently, but accidentally, while run-
ning from the foe, is an unusual circumstance. Still,
the brave, hard-fighting pacifist gets the girl, and all
is well.
The Wife Who Came Alive, by William Caine
(Herbert Jenkins, London). A yarn of the mother-
in-law from America who came between her daughter
Doll and her English artist-husband. Things are all
right in the end when the wife wakens up to under-
stand. The point of the brightly written tale is the
contrast 'between English and American domestic
ideas.
Cinderella in the South, by Arthur Shearly Cripps
(B. H. Blackwell, Oxford). These are short South
African tales by a missionary who is more anxious
to get atmosphere than to stick to his yarn. There
is a vague encouragement of old superstitious beliefs,
winch most churchmen would repudiate; and most
of the matter leaves the reader cold and confused.
and Dally, written by W. McCartney, pictures
by Poy.” A prose satire on British ways done in
a fashion which doesn't grip hard, and illustrated
in a way that, though clever, doesn’t matter.
The Betrothal, by Maurice Maeterlinck, translated
by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (Methuen, London).
This is a sequel to “The Blue Bird,” but lacks much
of tue charm and sweetness of that curious allegorical
pantomime. Tyltyl chooses a bride with the assist-
ance of his ancestors and descendants. Destiny
stands as a comic figure; and the movement of the
play is without much in the way of surprise.
White Savage. Simon, by Beatrice Grimshaw (Book-
stall Co., Sydney). Simon was brought up among
savages. So was Grace. With the help of a poet,
who had become his friend, Simon rescues the girl.
There are many adventures in the book, all of them
more or less exciting, original in plan and possible.
A good yarn of a loose, discursive sort, but far from
the best Beatrice Grimshaw can do.
The Funnel, by Dorothy M. Richardson (Duck-
worth, London). There is no story here, but just
an unconnected series of vivid pictures as seen by
a London dentist’s secretary a generation ago. The
impressionist style is at first a trifle confusing, but
the work is vivid and the phrasing good. An excel-
lent book of its kind, but one that can hardly be ex-
pected to gain wide popularity.
The Thunderbolt, by George Colmore (T. Fisher
Unwin, London). The book begins quietly with a
narration of somewhat ordinarv events. The char-
acters are convincing and well-drawn ; the writing is
good. Then the thunderbolt falls. The heroine is
infected with syphilis through the mistake of a Ger-
man experimentalist. From the moment of the
Dagedy up to the concluding suicide the yarn fails.
A book that might have been good, but isn’t.
Birth, by Zona Gale (Macmillan, New York) A
of * wo generations of provincial life in’ the
Middle West of the United States. There is fine
character study here and real sympathy. An
occasional attempt at “fine writing” and a bad
choice of words are faults readily forgotten in the
absorbing interest the author contrives to create.
The Shadow of the Past, by T. E. Mills Young
(Hodder and Stoughton, London). The story of a
German attempt to stir up trouble i n South "Africa.
1-ie color is good, but the characters do not con-
\ince, fnd the plot doesn’t in the least matter. A
harmless book which may get a wider public than
it deserves.
The Inky Way
Though Cocky is mostly hard-up, there
seems to be money behind the Vic. Farmers’
union. It has so far had a weekly organ,
the Farmers’ Advocate, to help it in getting
better prices for farm stuff, by cutting out
the middleman, and otherwise; now, in the
hope of _ catching the eyes of more con-
sumers, it proposes to make the Advocate
a daily.
“Seebee”: There is this to be put to the
debit of the commercial aeroplane—it isn’t
going to do the very desirable provincial
papers any good; the big city dailies will
get to places like Bathurst and Bendigo be-
fore the bacon and eggs. The pushful Daily
!l All ,r^ Iready doin £ i,: in th e Cold Country,
lhe Midland edition, printed in Manchester,
has been delivered at Carlisle and Edinburgh
(the latter nearly 200 miles distant) in time
for breakfast.
• ” : , Iu connection with Yankee copy-
right lavv there are possibilities which C. J.
Dennis (B. 3/6/T9) has overlooked. Owing
to the distance between Wilson’s Republic
and the Commonwealth, the Australian
author who sets about having a book copy-
righted in the U.S. is at the mercy of the
publisher with whom he negotiates. If he
strikes a reputable firm things are probably
0.1 v., but the best-known Yankee publishing
houses mostly have their hands full with
their own and English best-sellers and would
be unlikely to rush the handling of an Aus-
tralian publication unless it threatened to
be an unusual American success. The dis-
honest publisher (and there are plenty of
em) has only to rush 6ut an edition of an
Australian book which has been submitted
to him (while the Australian publisher is
holding the work back to permit of more or
less simultaneous publication in the two
countries) and sell one copy a mile, across
the Canadian border, and he secures cony-
right throughout the British Empire. This
may sound fantastic, but I understand it has
been attempted more than once with Eng-
lish books, although the nearness of the
countries enables the English publisher to
keep a much closer watch upon his Amurkan
contemporary than is possible from Aus-
tralia. Possibly there would be some sort
of legal remedy for such dishonesty, but by
the time two sets of lawyers with leagues
of ocean between them had settled the mat-
ter, the Australian author wmuld have spent
considerably more than he would be likely
to earn in royalties.
“Hamer”: All the English papers are
nervous about new slang, but, having once
accepted any word or phrase, it is worked
to death. I steadily fed sundry papers
with the word “Digger,” but invariably they
baulked at it. and “Australian”' or “Aus-
tralian soldier” was substituted. At last
London Evening News took the plunge
and _ printed “Diggers.” It must have
admired itself for its boldness, for after
that Diggers raged in print everywhere.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“U.P.”: It is just as well to ask the
young fellow his age when he wants to open
an account and go into debt. In the
Adelaide Insolvency Court the other day
Vincent H. Ternan, a blouse specialist, was
called up on the petition of Goode, Dumint
and Co., whereupon ids lawyer announced
his discovery by accident that the subject of
the inquiry was an “infant” (under 21).
Then the position was calmly reviewed. If
it were proved to the satisfaction of the
Court that Ternan was an “infant,” it fol-
lowed that he had been incapable of com-
pleting a valid contract, and that he could
not be made bankrupt by reason of such
contract. If there was no suggestion of
fraud he could not be made insolvent even
■ after he had attained full age for a debt
which he could not legally contract. But
if lie had represented himself to be of full
age, under circumstances amounting to
fraud, then he might be made bankrupt
upon attaining full age.
As a “common carrier” the Vic. Railways
Department is a hog, and in its sty the
ordinary statutes governing ordinary carriers
don’t apply. One delegate lately told the
Farmers’ Convention his experiences. He
sent a truck of firewood from Gembrook to
Ringwood, a few miles further along the
same line. It landed days later at Burnley,
where a stranger. “took delivery,” cut it up
and sold it. When found out he offered
half its value, and the amazing Department
disclaimed all responsibility. He sent 20
bags of spuds to a Melbourne agent; only
16 arrived. On complaint the Department
remarked that as he had loaded them into the
truck himself—the boy porter being too
busy—and as the Department hadn’t tallied
them in, it declined to shoulder any of the
blame. He sent four bags of peas to Mel-
bourne, paying passenger-train rates so that
they should reach a rising market early. The
Denartment sent them by goods train and
they were worth less than tuppence when
they landed. And again the Department
turned down a claim for compensation. If
’t isn’t piracy it’s something just as annoy-
ing.
* * * «
"Te hare” : There’s a solid little industry
waiting for Monaro and certain other parts
of N. S. Wales to build —the cultivation of
black and red currants, gooseberries and
raspberries. _ These fruits will only come to
perfection in cold climates, and do not
appear in quantity in the Sydney mar-
kets. Any grocer will tell you that he
rarely gets more than two, or perhaps
three, tins of black currant in a six-dozen
case of mixed jam, while the raspberry is
usually combined with “other choice fruits”
-—at any rate, according to the affidavit on
the label. The black currant contains a
demulcent and astringent principle beneficial
m sore throat and kindred affections, and is
employed as the basis of high-priced
lozenges and pastilles, which might be manu-
factured in Australia, and possibly are so
on a small scale. The jelly made from red
currants is comparatively scarce and com-
mands a high price, and when merely
bottled whole the fruit is excellent; yet most
of these products, as exhibited for sale in
grocers windows, bear the hall-mark of a
famous English house.

my plaint against this injustice was in-
variably met with, “But you know, sir, we

is a small matter.” With suit-lengths
soaring and tweeds from 10s. to 20s. a vard,

piesent pmce of suits should be a standard
one for men of 17st., all others to be paid
tor according to size of wearer. My friend
regards this as a tax on fat men, and that
is just what is needed. Fat men take up
twice as much of the tram as I do and wear
out the footpaths twice as quickly, thev

The Car of Quality.
150,000 Last Year!
—the enormous annual output of Overland motor cars!
Many thousands of them went to all parts of the world. The Overland
is indeed the international motor car, because it is made on a scale which
permits a value unapproached!
Appearance, performance, comfort, service, price all these essen-
tials of the ideal motor car are distinct Overland advantages.
For instance, note the “85-Four” shown here. A car of great power,
but so simple to operate that a child can drive it Sturdy, depend-
able, so satisfactory that it has won the enthusiasm _of everyone who
ever owned one.

his pigs had contracted swine-fever from the
Australians, put in a claim for compensa-
tion. It was just after Amiens, too.
At 84 Sam McCaughey, pioneer squatter
and millionaire, is a very old man. He
sleeps most of his days away now up at
the Yanco homestead, eats a little nee,
drinks some milk and lets the rest go.
Westralia has had its first prosecution
under the provisions of the Health Act re-
lating to venereal disease. The defendant
was prosecuted in the Perth Court for fail-
ing to continue treatment until cured, and
was fined £2 with costs.
Lieut. R. V. Wilson, of A.I.F. Head-
quarters, London, has been appointed private
sec. to Andrew Fisher, who tries, to keep
the wolf from the door of Australia House
on £5OOO a year. Prior to enlisting Wilson
was on the staff of the Inter-State Com-
mission in Melbourne. He saw service at
Gallipoli and in France, and he was on the
Southland when she was torpedoed in 1015.
Dr. Thacker, the footballer and politician
who became Mayor of Christchurch (M.L.)
recently, has introduced other methods in
dealing with callers. As each one enteis
the Mayoral den his name is handed to his
Yv orship, who questions him as to lus busi-
ness. Rapid notes are taken, and the caller
has only got to his preamble when he is
suddenly switched out, with the words .‘very
good, we’ll write to you,” following him
into the outer darkness. Christchurch has
sat up and taken notice since Thacker be-
came Mayor, which is saying something for
a town that has been so well and truly laid
out.
John Blair, recently back from the war. can
boast relationship, through his kinsmen, with
more armies than any other man in Australia.
He is one of 11 brothers, two of whom
fought with the S’Africans, one in “German
East” and the other in Europe ; one was
with the Canadians; and two were amongst
the first lot the U.S.A. sent to Europe. Two
others were with the Tommy forces *,
another was with the French Foreign
Legion; yet another, having taken the chance
of adventure with Italian, forces in the
Algerian trouble of years ago, remained, in.
Italy, and was with that army in its Alpine
stunts. John, who fought with the Aus-
tralians, doesn’t know where the other
brother happens to be.
A notable instance of hope triumphing over
experience is the lay preacher who turns up
every Thursday at lunch-time to conduct a
mission to the employees of Vic. Government
Printing Office. As a rule lie is accom-
panied by two equally zealous friends, one of
whom plays a portable harmonium and the
other sings. No disrespect is shown, simply
indifference. It is not even cold indiffer-
ence. The oratory of the preacher and the
melody of the singer are echoed by the Mines
laboratory and the public buildings, which
surround the space wherein the missionaries
exert themselves, but the printers and book-
binders heed not. Possibly they have enough
of the “chapel” during working hours.
Scraps of early-day Kalgoorlie history are
being resurrected by the Kalgoorlie Miner.
The story is told how, after the Coolgardie
find, W. G. Brookman left Adelaide with £92
as representative of a local syndicate, and
on arrival in the West tramped 400 miles to
Hannan’s. There, in company with W. S.
Pierce, a prospector of 24 years’ experience,
be pegged out the Boulder and Ivanboe.
Brookman walked to Coolgardie to secure
protection, and on his return pegged all the
ground which included the leases afterwards
held by the Lake View, Associated, Royal
Mint and Iron King, Bank of England,
Oroya, Brookman’s Boulder and West
Boulder—in all about 400 acres. Later on
G. P. Doolette went to London on behalf of
the Brookman syndicate to float the Boulder,
but at that time Australian ventures were
not popular, and be had some difficulty in
launching the show. The phenomenal yields
from the Boulder, however, soon dispelled
the feeling o,f distrust.
A line or two from London; —
Energetic Mrs. Tracy, who is with the Repatria-
tion Department at Belgrave Square, as adviser to
the new Mrs. Digger, puts the claimants in three
categories—wives, fiancees and fiascoes; and the
fiascoes, she says, are the most numerous.
Arthur Streeton is exhibiting some very interesting
pictures of war-ruins at the National Society of
Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in London. Blar.iire
Young shows some almost-futuristic color, and other
Australians exhibiting are Charles Bryant, George
Coates, Kay Edmunds, H. A. Fullwood, Frances
Hodgkins, Fred Leist and Thea Proctor.
The Australian artists’ colony in London has been
joined by Dennis Connelly, an old Melbourne
Galleryite, now the staff artist for the Star,
London’s independent daily, for which he has been
doing extraordinarily effective work. Connelly, who
has seen four years’ active service with the Imperial
Army, and has been wounded, gassed and shell-
shocked, is reputed to be the youngest cartoonist
holding a staff appointment on a London daily. He
is a son of Mrs. Peters, wife of Sydney Telegraph’s
news-editor.
“Araminta”: One effect of the war, with
the ensuing scarcity of household supplies,
has been to increase the number of shops
dealing in second-hand items like crockery
and doormats. A vast number of Australian
housewives have no idea of values. The
missus may be anxious to spread out her
husband’s wages by “picking up bargains”
at junk-shops; but the effort is too often
frustrated by lack of knowledge. For
instance, when I wanted some saucers to
mate with half a dozen widowed teacups,
the second-hand dealer asked exactly twice
as much as I afterwards paid for a better
article, first-hand, in a china shop. The
junkman was a fat, prosperous-looking soul
with an ingratiating manner, who pre-
sently, after pretending to make a calcula-
tion, offered the saucers at a reduction
of a ha’penny each for the half-dozen.
And I believe the “reduction” 'would
in most cases have clinched the bargain.
The extent to which the resurrecting busi-
ness has gone ahead, pushed by this sort
of swindling, is shown by the fact that a
friend who lately thought about buying a
rubbishery in a Melbourne suburb, six miles
from the G.P.0., was asked £4OO for the
goodwill alone.

in the bass vibrate at a
much slower rate than
the treble, the wood at
this end of the sound-
board is coarser.
How Perfect Tone-quality is Assured
7HE sound-board has rightly been called the “soul” of a piano. It must be
constructed of most carefully selected timber and be scientifically graded so
as to sympathetically respond to the vibrations of the strings. This is work
for experts—craftsmen who are thoroughly conversant with acoustic principles
and know how to apply them.
In the making of the Beale Piano the sound-board is
constructed in exactly the same way as the belly of a
violin. The best quality white pine is used clear,
straight-grained wood that has the most resonant
properties of all woods for this purpose, ihe
sound-board is not one big piece ot wood but is
built up of small strips of about six inches width.
These are graded from very coarse grain in the bass
to very fine in the treble. The ribs are manufactured
from clear-grained fir and each one is not only glued
to the back of the board, but screwed as well. These
ribs are of a particular shape which gives a convex
surface to the front of the board. Then when the
bridges are affixed and the strings placed into
position the sound-board deflects the tone waves in
exactly the same way as does the belly of a violin.
This convex surface —or camber— must be perma-
nent, otherwise tone-quality will be impaired. Every
Beale sound-board is guaranteed in writing, for 25
years. Even m the far north of Queensland the
Beale Piano retains its fine gradations of tone—a
clear, bell-like treble; a rich, singing, mellow middle
register, and a deep sonorous, powerful bass.
The Beale Piano is made in several styles,

The soft, white light of a Laurel-burning
lamp is immensely satisfying both from
the material and artistic point of view. Its
genial glow gives that real home atmo-
sphere wherein we all find pleasure. It
gives just that artistic touch to the
setting of your rooms that adds so much
to the pleasure of your evenings.
Laurel has many qualities which com-
mend it to capable housekeepers. It
burns steadily and clearly to the last
thimbleful, and is soothing to the eyes.
Laurel is odorless and smokeless, and is
most economical. Laurel means lighting,
heating and cooking satisfaction of a
very high order.
When ordering don’t say Kerosene—ask
for Laurel.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Now that the English Bowling Associa-
tion has made arrangements for a M.L. team to
visit the U.K. next year, Australian devotees of the
solemn game are considering the question of des-
patching a party for a roll-up on English greens.
Bowlers from N.S.W. paid an unofficial visit to
England some years ago and met with fair success.

A flying motor-cycle is the latest terror.
A Swiss inventor has demonstrated the practicability
of his machine by flying it a distance of one
mile at a height of 15 feet. It is a small biplane,
whose wings can be closed up by pulling a lever
when the wheels come to earth. With a 30-h.p.
engine a speed of 56 m.p.h. can be attained in the
air, and about 40 miles an hour on the road.
In Adelaide lacrosse, so far this season,
East Torrens stands out alone, having played 10
matches.and won them all. Sturt, Goodwood and
University follow on the list. The East Torrens
score in goals is 118 made, to 25 lost. A curious
point about their heavy-scoring attack is that it
consists of three brothers Oke. There is a fourth
brother coming on, in the B team, of the club.
“Machete”: “G.N.,” answering “Trot” on
the merits of League and Union Rugby football,
refers to a list of Maoriland Union top-notchers
and says that N. S. Wales produced others as
good “including Abbott, Wickham, Oxenham,
Charley White and Spragg.” Abbott and Oxenham
were Queenslanders before they passed to N.
S. Wales. They came from that great nursery of
Union players, Brisbane Grammar.

A few old Melbourne sports are raising a
little money on behalf of “Dummy” Mace, old-
time boxer, with the idea of putting him in a way
to provide for his old age. Mace has been battling
hard for a living these many years, and now he
has but little eyesight left to lighten his dumbness,
which is hard on one who could sometimes turn his
hand to watchmaking when he wasn't mutely in-
viting a rare pupil to hit him with the gloves.
The Amateur Rowing Association of Eng-
land lias made one small breach in its snobbish
regulation which bars from competition any rowing
man who is not a haw-gentleman—that is, who “is
or has been, by trade or employment for wages, a
mechanic, artisan or laborer, or engaged in any other
menial duty.” At the last meeting of the Ass. an
earnest appeal was made by some of the more pro-
gressive to throw this mouldy regulation overboard ;
but the fool element was too strong. Still, it um
allowed that service rendered to one’s country in
the late war for pay, as by munition-making, shall
not disqualify.

“Ike Pagliacci” : The boxing champion is
mostly keen on the cash, and when the ghost doesn’t
walk he is liable to tear up the fight promoter.
Bob Fitzsimmons threatened to make some invalids
at New Orleans in 1893 after his fight with Hall:
instead of bullion, they wanted to pay him his
whack with the old lumber used to erect the arena.
Tommy Burns hated to part up. When King Cole’s
Bohemians were about to play Bendigo, Cole lent
his tent to Burns for a bio. show. Tent men
worked all night (with the actors giving a hand)
to have the canvas up in time. Burns came along
in the morning, counted the men on the job, and
handed the foreman 4s. 3d.—the exact money for
17 moderate beers.
“J.H.”: Bombardier Wm. G. Staley, who
has just won a- treble, including the singles and
pairs championships, of the Waverley Bowling Club,
has been a topnotcher in every sport he has en-
gaged in. After serving his time at sea he was for
a. while at Port Adelaide. Playing cricket for
Ethelton v. Birkenhead on one occasion he hit, in
one over, 4,4, 4,4, 4, 5. In the same match he
took five wickets for 7 runs. Coming to Sydney, he
joined the old Ultimo Club. Then he took up rifle
shooting. In his second year he won the champion-
ship, which he held for six years. In football he
was a great right-wing player for Balmain under
the Soccer code, and he also handles a decent stick
at billiards. On the Somme in 1916 he captained
the 4th Division Artillery team which won the
tug-of-war. He was gassed at the Somme, but he
wasn t going to be beaten by a mere tenth-rater like
Fritz.
“993”: It was when some of the Light
Horse were at Abbassan on one of the periodical
“rests.” The Brigade sports were being held, and
all ranks were represented, from the G.O.C. down-
wards. Everyone was prepared to back his fancy
and piastre paper pounds and half-pounds were as
plentiful as flies around an unprotected jam-tin in
summer. Also the bowl flowed freely and as the
day went on the average Billjim got into that mood
which made him care not a tinker’s curse for any-
thing or anybody. No matter the event, Billjim
had money to prove that the representative of his
regiment would win. One Aussie, with a 50-piastre
note in his hand, was rushing wildly over the land-
scape during the wrestling on horseback, shouting
“I’ll bet 50 the —th wins!” As he lurched in the
direction of a congregation of Tabs, the Brig, inter-
cepted him with, “Hey, take a pull; there’s the
General.” But instead of the Brig.’s words having
a soothing effect, they only served to increase Bill-
jim s excitement. “Where,” he yelled, “where is
the General? I’ll bet the blanky Geheral 50 the
—th man wips.” And before he could be prevented
the irreverent horseman, shaking the 50-note under
the General’s nose, yapped, “Hey, Genera], I’ll bet
you 50 the —th man wins! Don’t want to bet?
Oh, all right.” Then, as he walked away disgusted,
Some blokes wouldn’t bet on the sun rising.”
A Victorian provincial daily wrote to the
secretaries of the different football clubs in the dis-
trict, asking if they would be good enough to send
in a short report of their matches, as the paper did
not possess enough reporters to cover them all. In
response a club secretary arrived at the office one
night lately wearing a badly-blackened eye, and
handed in this:—
“The Junior Football Clubs of Dogtown and Cow-
ville played a match yesterday on the Cowville re-
creation ground. The chief feature of the game was
the favoritism shown to Cowville by the incom-
petent who acted as umpire. Yes, we refer to Bill
Johnston. If he doesn’t like the way we talk about
him he can come along and get some more of what
I gave him yesterday. Although Dogtown possessed
infinitely the better team, through the favoritism
of the umpire, who gave the ball to Cowville everv
few minutes, no score was made until after the
second half, when Joe Dunstan, one of the stalwarts
of Dogtown, seized the ball, and running the length
of the field kicked a goal. This was of course dis-
allowed by the umpire, who gave as his reason the
pitiful explanation that Joe had broken the nose of
the Cowville full-back en route. Burning with
righteous indignation the supporters of Dogtown
swarmed on to the field, and had not the cowardly
dastard taken to his heels it would indeed have gone
hard with him. However, he did not escape scot-
free, for at. the gate ho collided with our able secre-
tary, who grappled with him and brought him to
the ground, where he administered condign punish-
ment. We would like to say in this connection that
gouging is the last resource of a ruffian and a
hoodlum, and that we are willing to fight the
with fists any time he pleases. He knows that I
can knock the works out of him. so there is no likeli-
hood of him accepting this challenge. I would also
like to say that if any of the Cowville team say that
we lost the game yesterday that we will knock the
“ ii“ down their throats. Anyway, WE didn’t
®j!‘ , ru n away after the match, and OUR captain
didn’t spend the night in the bush because he was
afraid to show his face near honest people. We are
a law-abiding club, but if some people like to go
round slandering us they can thank themselves for
what they get.”

THE LIGHT FOUft
In Studebaker Cars
Quality is Inherent
THE public recognition of quality in
Studebaker Motor Cars is a resultant
of good intentions strictly carried out.
The name Studebaker, for sixty-seven
years has meant just this, for Studebaker
has put into its product honest, careful
and experienced workmanship, and the
best material money can buy.
In the splendid Studebaker models quality is
present in the material deep in the vital parts,
where it is revealed only when the emergencv
comes; by years of durable service, and in its silent
smooth-running efficiency.
Th ere is also an evidence of Studebaker quality that
you can plainly see. Compare the beautiful finish
of body work, the quality of leather upholstery,
the distinctive Gypsy hood.
These are the outward evidences of quality. But
the real quality in Studebaker cars is found in the
provision to meet every contingency, which affords
an assurance of real satisfaction through long years
of service.
Call at our showroom and let us show you,
point by point, why Studebaker cars excel.
Let us demonstrate that to equal their quality
you will have to pay substantially more.

The Outtrim family of Vic. has a line
capacity for sticking it. A. R. Outtrim is
father of the Vic. Leg. Assembly and nine
times a Minister; and a brother, F.T.,
has just thrown up the job of secretary to
the shire of Tullarook after 54 years’
service. And before the shire came to life
he was secretary of a local road board.
Six years ago two young Australian min-
ing engineers went off to help open up the
new tinfidds of Nigeria. One, Jack Tilley,
came back to Sydney, when the war started,
to die of malaria. The other, Theo Ivir-
wan, of Tasmania, was fit enough to fight
through the Cameroons campaign, and then
went on to Mesopotamia. Now news comes
of his burial there.
Skewes, Federal Public Service inspector,
who lately had a brush with Justice Powers
in the Arbitration Court, is regarded as a
likely man for the big job of Commonwealth
Public Service Commissioner. Only a few
minutes before getting ruffled the Judge said
that the work done by Skewes in the Arbi-
tration Court alone was worth four figures
a year. He began 28 years ago as private
secretary to Sargood, then Vic. Minister for
Defence and Education, and has always been
a conspicuous officer-.
Captain H. J. Butler, of Minlaton
(S.A.), arrived in Adelaide the other day.
In 1914 he was a young farmer who used to
disturb his neighbors by escapades on a
motor-bike, but early the next year he went
to the Point Cook aviation school to study
air mechanics. Finding it would be some
time before he got to the Front by that
route he paid his passage to England,
joined the Royal Air Force, and became
first a group-commander and then a fight-
ing instructor. Butler is now waiting in
Adelaide for his Bristol monoplane, and
proposes to fly home to Yorke Peninsula —-
the first serious flight across water in Aus-
tralia.
Law-clerk Bill Slater, who was elected
Labor M.L.A. for Dundas (Vic.) while over-
seas with the A.1.F., is getting early off
the mark in his long journey towards the
State Attorney-Generalship. Slater’s pioneer
effort at law-making is to be a bill guaran-
teeing equal pay for equal work. ShouM
the Liberal majority refrain from snatch-
ing the bill out of Slater’s hands and put-
ting it by for a glorious resurrection later
on, Slater’s attempt, if successful, should
at least do his party no harm. There is
nothing red-flaggish about the idea of pay-
ing as much to a girl who humps boxes in
a factory as, to the youth who does the same
thing no better.
“Deco”: Here is another example of the
centralisation foolishness (or worse) assisted
by the Shipping Ring. Tasmania, badly
catered for through quarantine restrictions,
was in need of flour, sugar and general
goods. An enterprising Speck firm chartered
a vessel to trade direct between Hobart and
Brisbane, and thus be clear of the restrictions
incurred through calling at Sydney. It dis-
covered, however, that it could secure only
20 tons of general cargo; so an almost
empty ship travelled back 1150 miles to
Hobart. The Shipping Ring had no steamers
running direct, so general cargo was railed
or shipped to Sydney, to be discharged and
re-loaded for Tasmania. It’s things like
this that make the sovereign worth less than
20 shillings.
There are two or three people in Tas-
mania who aren’t so sure now that all the
troubles of employees would be over if they
employed themselves —in other words, if the
State employed everybody. A man in the
Speck’s big hydro-electric department had a
brain-wave and worked up the idea, he says,
in his spare time. The Department wants
it, but refuses to pay royalty; and an old,
old. question is being threshed out again.
But there won’t be any definite answer, be-
cause complications inevitably come in, and
in nine cases out of ten it is a matter for
adjustment between the two parties. The
nrivate employer who demanded the full bene-
fits of an employee’s invention without giv-
ing anything in return would certainly be
turned down as a trade-hog.
From an Australian mining man in
S’Africa: —
Recent events indicate that black brother is get-
ting wise to the ways of his white master, and is
practically on strike. Anyone who has worked in
the Rand mines, while having no love for the “boys”
(the deep, hot workings with the effluvia of a sweat-
ing gang of niggers dispels the brotherhood-of-man
theory), cannot honestly overlook the petty and
unjust manner in which they are treated by some
of the cos. Each shift a boy is set a task, which
in the case of a hand-steel stoping boy is 30in., and
any boy who fails to make this distance does not
receive a ticket (his day’s certificate of earning),
and having no ticket he receives no tucker when l.e
reports to the compound, nor wages when his pay-
day comes round. Each boy going on shift receives
only four drills, and if the sharpening has been poor
or faulty, it is practically impossible to bore -he
necessary 30in., as no further drills can be obtained
for the shift. It is pretty tough on a boy who has
put in a good shift in the dust and stink and struck
bad drills or hard ground (and it is hard here) and
bored within an inch or so of the stipulated distance
to lose his day’s pittance and food —tough
when balanced against the dividends that are paid
by these cos. and accepted with pious thanks by
the English shareholders.

Hugh C. Buckler has just got clear of
the Army, and is in London playing in “The
Very Idea” —a Yankee farce having eugenics
for its theme.
“Aisle Seat” : At an Auckland vaudeville
house the other night an imported act got
so much on the nerves of a man in the
front row that he tossed a couple of pennies
on the stage. This is M.L.’s method, of
indicating boredom. But the sarcasm was
wasted on a boxful of newly-arrived Yanks
who, thoroughly enjoying the act, reckoned
this was the islander’s way of expressing
appreciation. They accordingly bombarded
the player with half-crowns and florins.
Not till the lady in the act had finished her
speech on the subject of their manners did
they realise dimly that there was a mistake
somewhere.

The original “Fx and R” Watches are known
throughout Australasia for their marvellous
accuracy and endurance.
But, as usual, we progress, and so now we
are showing the
SUPER “Fx and R” WATCH.
Its present price is 63 /in steel case; but
what a watch it is ! Eve y latest improvement
known to horological science is in it.
It is jewelled in every part where wear occurs.
It will go with profound accuracy ; indeed, it
is so accurate that a ship could be steered to
England by it. . . , ,
For strength and standing up against hard
wear we unhesitatingly say that no watch the
world over equals the SUPER “Fx and R
WATCH.

to-morrow (Friday) night, in order to give
"The Pink Lady” a show. No words from
this paper can cause “The Pink Lady” to
be more loved by habitual Criterionites than
she is at present. As regards the rest of
the community, it should suffice to remark
that the leading parts are in the hands of
Gladys Moncrieff, Phil Smith, Florence
Young and Reginald Roberts'
The very nervous Muriel Starr is playing
her last nights in Australia at Pier Majesty’s
(Sydney). “The Silent Witness” is claimed
bv the management to be the play in which
the lady is at her best. Probably that is
correct, for through a somewhat incoherent
plot she steers the story to a conclusion
which, if it doesn’t satisfy the critical, at
least is comfortably approved by the
audiences that have been flocking to say
good-bye to the leaving lady.
Lauder still swaggers amongst the heather
and bawbees at Sydney Palace. The songs
that he will sing are given out in advance
like hymns, and the prices are plainly
marked on the advertisements, presumably
that Caledonia may not grow too stern and
wild at the door.
“Look Who's Here’.’ is still rattling along
cheerfully at the Tivoli (Sydney), and Archie
and Gertie continue to risk their
necks with great success. These artists
have each broken two bushels of bones dur-
ing their professional careers. It must be
a wearing business. A new musical cocktail
entitled A Rox of Tricks”, is to be poured
out on Saturday.

In Sydney pictures Norma Talmadge
depicts the heartbeats of Wetona, an
Indian girl in love with one whose in-
tentions are strictly dishonorable. Then
Dad and his dusky warriors take a
hand in Cupid’s game, and Wetona is mar-
ried to another. However, at the end of the
story she has struck the right trail and
moccasined herself into the innermost wig-
wam of her husband’s heart. _ The Crys-

Sydney Conservatorium orchestra joined
with the Apollo Club last week and presented
David’s “The Desert” with tenor Newbury
and Maoriland soprano Amy Murphy as
soloists. Conductor Alfred Hill’s baton beat
the air and the instruments filled the Town
Hall with fine music. In the second part
Amy Murphy sang “Australia Awakens”
words by P. E. Quinn, brother to Rod and
a poet in his own right.

Winifred Jenner and Henry Messiter,
pupils of the Philip 'Wilsons. let the King’s
Hall (Sydney) hear an all-British song pro-
gramme last Friday night. The songs in-
eluded poems by Henley, Stevenson, Herrick,
Masefield and Will Shakspeare, and com-
posers Roger Quilter and Albert Mallinson
figured largely on the programme. Miss
Jenner sang with charm and discernment,
and an enunciation that was about humanly
perfect; Mr. Messiter, who has the knack, of
making his songs interesting, in his render-
ing of the “To Julia” cycle warmed even
the chilly caverns of the King’s Hall.
“Going Up” goes out to-morrow after going
on for 15 weeks at Melbourne Majesty’s.
On Saturday “You’re in Love” will be re-
vived for six nights, after which comes a
brief repeat of “Oh, Boy.”

New songs and specialties have been in-
troduced into “The Officers’ Mess,” now in
its eighth week at Melbourne Tivoli. They
didn’t arrive before they were needed.
“Daddies” at Melbourne King’s is still
struggling to enlighten us on the manage-
ment of children. The general argument of
the_ play is that a nipper is best placated by
politely suffering its little tyrannies, and
this opinion gets the support of the gruffest
extempore parent after he has had a few
hours of his own chosen angel. The break-
ing-in of this particular dad (George
Bryant) shows the power of a spoilt, in-
tractable kid, but it also reveals the latitude
of the management’s producer. Bryant’s ex-
perience would have been much briefer if
the producer’s job had been handed to the
matron of a crCche.

A Melbourne one-man show:—
A collection of Phillips Fox canvases at the Fine
Art Society gives one a chance to renew acquaint-
ance with some taking performances. The huge
and unwieldy “Terrace” heads the price-list, but
the painting is grave and portentous and the sub-
ject might be a Family Hera.ld illustration de luxe.
“Lamplight” is more decorative, but it gives one
the impression of a genre strain in the artist
slowly submitting to a French education. In the
majority of the other pictures, however, we get the
Fox who loved the Stark greens of Spring and the
color of vivid gardens. His “Summer” has a fas-
cination for its brilliant .flesh-painting, apart from
its general pictorial effect. It is a spontaneous
tribute to beauty inspired by a fine figure and a
golden day, and no other nude of Fox’s has the
same gleam of genius. “The Reclining Nude” and
The Thorn” are bleak and formal by comparison.
Fox was most at home in the "Dejeuner,” “Love
Story” and “Green Parasol” type of subject, but
he provided a richer entertainment in “The Muslin
Dress,” which has none of the pardonable stridencies
of his outdoor palette. The landscapes include
hurried views around Sydney, Tahiti, the Medi-
terranean and other scattered places, but none
of them have the quality of the two large efforts
“Pine Tree” and “The Pool.” Both of these have
a sort of stealthy magic, whereas in the others the
artist has mostly diarised his rather extensive travels.
Mclntosh has sent to Adelaide Tivoli a
co. which is to revive a number of favorite
comedies. “A Message from Mars” is the
first; Charles Wheeler still holds McMahon’s
place as the Londoner who had to be cur^d
of selfishness by shocks. --Revivals are in
order just now. Wondergraph has the old
“Squaw Man” in a well-filmed version, and
West’s (at the Royal before getting back
into its own renovated house) has “Stolen

Orders,” which is the old Drury Lane
“Sealed Orders” Americanised. (As an
owner once said: “They broke two of the
Commandments. First they stole my work,
and then they adulterated it.”) The com-
pleteness of a screen rendering—airship,
battleship and so on, leaving far behind any
bluff-that a stage carpenter can put Up—
suggests that all spoken drama depending
mainly on spectacle must presently be
knocked out. The Pav. serves up romance,
with Viola Dana as the lame daughter of
a blind father ; and the Grand gives the
continuous thrills of railroad-raiding, with
Marjorie Rambeau. The Majestic has
Gerald, an immensely popular sofdier and
fine eccentric dancer; Villiers Arnold, intro-
ducing his old Mikado attitude into a
Chinese song; and Fuller's nine juvenile
(alleged) Wonders. That there are no
trams after about 6 p.m. does not seem to
worry very many.
The Wellington (M.L.) girl Nellie Fal-
lon, who ventured forth, with eight others,
known as the Dancing Darlings, is a success
in S’Africa. The darlings, however, changed
their title when a dancing gent joined the
act, which now gets on the bills as “The Ten
Anzacs—Nine Beautiful Women and One
Fortunate Man.”
Rupert Browne, a young Bendi-
gonian who worked as a scenic artist under
Phil Goatcher at Melb. Royal, has annexed
a job in the paint-room at Drury Lane, as
assistant to Bruce Smith, the veteran who for
years has been responsible for most of the
big “sets” used in the spectacular melo-
dramas and pantomimes in which the theatre
specialises. Young Browne, who went over-
seas with the A.1.F., is believed to be the
first Australian to hold a job of this kind at
Drury Lane.
Petramos”: Alick Lauder beat brother
Harry to the vaudeville footlights, and,
though he never attained eminence, Jim
Brennan thought the relationship good
enough to import him to Australia. Alick
had one real song success. Wherever he
went he carried a copy of this ditty, together
with some documents, explaining that they
proved his copyright. He guarded the papers
caiefully that an Adelaide manager at
length inquired their cost. “Cost, mon?”
he replied. “A mint o’ money. Every

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Re the oldest
book and stationery store in Australia (B
24/7/T9). William Moffatt was in business
in King-street, Sydney, 90 years ago. In
the late ’thirties he moved into Pitt-street
ft door or two from King-street. When he
died the business fell to his manager, T. R
Yeo, one of the pioneers of Randwick. From
Yeo it passed to the I’enfolds, who are
still to be found at the old shop. An interest-
ing memento is the firm’s specimen-book,
which contains billheads, business-cards, etc
produced in the house for now close upon a
century.
Lloyd’s survey party, which left Sydney
;U January to map out trans-Australian
landing-places for the proposed London-
»/ dne Y aenal service, reached Darwin on
May 00. Three of the party overhauled per
motor-bike and two in side-cars. Some of
the going in the Northern Territory was
rough, but, as for the unspeakable climate,
the days were bonny in the regions of these
Barkly tablelands. The nights were cold,
with glorious skies and stars that twinkled
m millions.” Landing-places were surveyed
at Moree (N.S.W.), Charleville, Longreach,
Cloncurry, Burketown (Q.), Brunette,
Katherine, and Darwin (N.T.).
“Have-not” : “Camelero” unjustly belittles

the end of July, 1918, only two awards of
Oi'der of the Nile had been made in the
A. 1.1. —to Rirdwood and Chauvel. To the
same date but 20 of the A.I.F. had been
awarded the Servian Order of the White
Eagle—in every instance for services on Gai-
li poll. The 20 include such soldiers as
Generals Hobbs and Sinclair-MacLagan:
Colonel Lloycl, a great artillery officer;
Colonels Durrant and Marks, who were in
s A u^ c ® ss * on „ c-o.’s of the most famous of the
A.LF infantry battalions, the 13th; and

A.R. V.”: For joyous surprises in school
you can t beat Scripture examinations. The
pupils had been invited to relate how Christ
dealt with the question of Roman taxation.

, ie round of life prevailing in pre-war days
doesn t happen. A substantial railway ser-
vice has been changed into a phantom
which makes the unfortunates who have to
use it wonder whether they or it have gone
mad. There isn’t any coal to be had —only
thin, shadowy slack that shudders through
the grate in a black, ghostly way. There
is no bacon to speak of, no eggs to be had,
and often no _ meat, though men say that
these substantial things have existence in
large quantities somewhere. There are no
empty houses and no building material. The
shadowy trains will carry beer, but not bricks;
whisky, but not wood. There aren’t any
strikes even, and the shadow of no-work is
creeping over the land. It is quite possible
that when Massey and Ward reach home
they will find that they are not Massey and
Ward at all, but mere gassy shapes. People
who asked for railway tickets for Trentham
racecourse last week were told that there
was no such station on the line —no trains
called there, and if there was a race meet-
ing it was only a ghost of one, with de-
materialised horses skimming over a moon-
shine track.

as one-tenth the money he deserved.
“0.K.”: When does the British- or
American-born actor in our midst cease to be
imported and begin to be Australian? Bland
Holt presumably counts as an old Australian
actor and manager; yet he was born to the
business in England. Atliolwood and Arthur
Styan are bracketed in many people’s minds
as local actors ; but while the former is pure
Australian the latter was brought here by
Charles Cartwright some 20 years ago.
.Leslie Victor, originally one of Brough’s im-
portations, has surely acquired the standing
of Australian actor, seeing that he has
passed a larger proportion of his theatrical
life on the Australian stage than A. E.
Greenaway or, perhaps, George Bryant, both
of whom were young Australian actors ere
they went to America. Harford, now quite
an old-timer, was on the English stage before
this country saw him with Bland Holt.
Surely Harford is an Australian actor by
this time! And Emma Temple, who had her
fare paid from England once upon a time —
isn’t she an Australian actress as compared
with Marie Lohr, who never acted in this
country at all? If “Constant Reader” is
going to . persist in wagering on the question
whether somebody who played First Grave-
digger at the end of last century was “Aus-
tralian” or “imported,” he had better come
to a definite understanding with his friends
as to what constitutes an Australian actor.
“O’Smith”: My strong-man story. When
Sandow was here he was wandering through
the wilds of Bungaree (Vic.) in search of
Bob Ogilvie, the district Hercules. As it
happened he met Bob, who had been doing
a bit of ploughing, and had just unhitched
his team. Sandow asked if Mr. Ogilvie lived
nearabouts. Bob picked up his plough in
one hand, and pointing with it, answered,
“Over there somewhere.” Sandow moved
on.

M AY: “The new dancer's frocks are pretty
brief, aren’t they?”
B ELLE: “ Indecent, I call them. Anyone
would think she was in a ballroom in-
stead of on the stage.”
“M.P.A.”; Our old melodious friend the
“Belle of New York” is in full swing at
London Lyceum, and is likely to run along
till the annual panto. The cast includes
an old Australian, Harry Meymott, who
plays Bronson. This is Meymott’s first Lon-
don appearance in the “Belle,” though he
played the part for five and a half years
with the late Geo. Musgrove’s No. 1 touring
co. in “the provinces.” In 1908 and 1911
he visited Aussie on the Rickards circuit,
and made a hit with “My Burglar” and
“Semi-detached,” Prior to the “Belle” sea-
son Meymott had been on the road with
“The Lilac Domino,” playing the nice fat
comedy part. Mclntosh has secured the
“Domino” for Australia, but will have to
look further afield than his present com-
panies for the singing parts. Perhaps he
will look towards Meymott.
“Deco”: Nellie Mortyne, mentioned by
“E.T.” (B. 26/6/T9), has been in London
for some years. She is now 57, and still
gives good value. Brother Charlie, of Bland
Ilolt and Brough days, has been for a few
years local agent for a steamship co. on the
Clarence River (N.S.W.). Also he is watch-
mender, music-teacher and fishing expert to
the. local community. He’s close on 70, hale
and hearty, and, unlike the old pro. of tradi-
tion, is independence personified.
John Wren did at least one good thing for
the stage while he was dropping coin in
theatrical management. He gave Rosina
Buckman ’ a first big show in opera—“ The
Lily of Killarney.” The girl’s latest
success in London was her Mimi in “La
Bohhme.”
“0.N.G.”; The Maoriland picture-show-
man has had an adventurous life for a year
past. Last winter was climatically the
worst for 10 years, and wound up with the
’flu epidemic. Then Minister Russell pro-
duced his bill reducing the hours —after-
noons 2 to 5; evenings 7 to 10. The idea
was to prevent the spread of the ’flu by
compressing the 11 hours’ attendance of the
continuous theatres into six. The Act also
ensured v well-packed queues outside each
theatre twice daily, enabling the fresh air
and sleet to combat the germs. Now train
services have been cut in halves, and as
Maoriland is run on the circuit system as
to three-fourths of its film service, the coun-
try showman has hud every chance of find-
ing himself hauling his spools out of the
guard’s-van as his audience has been leaving
the hall. Film House, Maoriland’s big
exchange, has had the appearance of being
inhabited by chess-problem fanatics, as it
wrought with the problem of making the
2.55 from Taumaranui connect with the
6.14 from Ohakune. An ingenious system
of motor transit has saved the day, but it
hasn’t decreased the showman’s overhead
expenses.
“Vaudeville Veteran”: The “Mr. C.” (Ser-
geant Currie) who is telling stories to Fuller
audiences was the originator of the masked-
man idea in vaudeville. When he married
the American girl Maud Courtney and
appeared at the Ltindon Palace, he wore a
red mask and scandalised the austere stage-
manager, John Damler, by asking
permission to sing from the royal
circle. Anyone who remembers the
Palace in its best Vaudeville days
will understand John's' horror.
“Mr. C.,” however, dressed the
part well enough to come in con-
tact with dukes and things, and
Damler overcame his objection; so
for the first time in Palace history
a performer invaded the sacred
circle. The ushering-in of an act
at the Palace, by the way, is more
dignified than any Peace ceremony.
Two be-wigged and silk-stockinged
gents appear at the centre opening
of the tab cloth, bearing cards on
which are the performers’ names.
With stately tread they take these
to either side of the stage and fix
them in their slots. Then they
slowly return to the centre, meet,
wheel, and shoulder to shoulder,
bow and exit, the cue for Fincke’s
band of 45 to burst into melody.
“Chu Chin Chow,” at London
Majesty’s, has been followed to the
1000 mark by “The Maid of the
Mountains” at Daly’s. Each of
these has been running for three
years or so; and the modern,cus-
tom of afternoon performances
gets many more into a year than
in the old days of “Our Boys,” for
instance. The Maid is played eight
times a week, and Oscar Asche
crowds in 10. Others still running
are “Going Up” and “The Naughty
each having scored a year, and “Yes,
Uncle,” two.
“C. Ockney”: “O.K.’s” interesting re-
marks re the digging up, of antique melo-
dramas for latter-day production (B.
17/7/’l9) reminds me that John Hollifig"
head,' a particularly shrewd entrepreneur,
made much capital out of such resurrections
when he was managing the Gaiety. “Prac-
tical John” ran these plays at matinees and
kept the “sacred lamp of burlesque” burn-
ing—with Edward Terry, Teddy Royce,
Kate Vaughan and Nellie Farren —at night.
The experiment was highly successful, for
playgoers got as many laughs out of, say,
“Monk” Lewis’s “Castle Spectre,” seriously
played, as ever they did out of “Little Don
Caesar” or “Bohemian Gyurl.” Similarly the
unconscious humor of “The Worst Woman
in London” appealed to amusement-seekers
when that curio was brought from its Shore-
ditch home to the Adelphi. The West-enders
crowded in to see it and advertised it by
word of mouth as the “funniest play going,
don’t yer know.” When it saw the nightly
returns the management laughed loudest of
all.
“Rolfo”: William Thorner, the New York
teacher who coached Galli-Curci for her
American apnearances (Vadislav Tschorachek
was his baptismal moniker), has just drawn
another big prize in the vocal lottery—Rosa
Ponselle, a youthful dramatic soprano wlip
has set all musical New York talking, and
is said to be another Titiens in the making.
Thorner takes a percentage of his pupils’
earnings, and this, together with his studio
fees, is said to bring him in six or seven
thousand pounds per annum. He was for 14
years connected with Jean and Edouart} de
Reszke, and taught in Paris until the war
drove him to the U.S.A. (Unlimited Shekels
Available).
“Make-Up”: If some enterprising specu-
lator would pick up available Australian
vaudeville talent, re-dress it, give it a
polishing up and take it to London, he would
have a sounder proposition than offering hi-
salaries to English and Yankee artists to
come here. A dozen or so Australian
artists who quitted this country in despera
tion are doing well on the London halls,
and in one act at least—Billy Wells and the
“LOOK WHO’S HERE,” AT SYDNEY
TIVOLI.
Gertie and Archie Falls, acrobats, in “a few
hard knocks.”
Eclaire Twins—were getting a three-figure
salary two months ago. The twins were
formerly the Anderson sisters, and showed
round Sydney suburbs quite recently.
“Ox”: The spectacular career of Harry
Sadler had a dramatic climax when he threw
himself off a bridge at Leichhardt (Sydney)
last week. Sadler had run shows in every
capital in Australia, and attracted a patron-
age peculiarly his own. His inveterate habit
of getting into minor troubles that threat-
ened to be big ones kept him from reaping
the reward of undoubted energy and talent
of a kind. His biggest success was at the
Princess’s Theatre (Sydney),, where the
Stiffy and Mo revues originated under his
management.
“Ox”: Sydney James had a hoodoo
in the shape of a replica of his
mechanical Billy. Billy and his shadow
were born in the same Birmingham factory
at the same cost; yet James had a
100-nightmare-power horror of using any
but the Original, although most people
couldn’t tell the difference. Whenever Billy’s
internal mechanism went wrong and the
shadow emerged triumphantly from the box,
something dire happened. It was extra rheu-
matics for James, a bad house, or some other
affliction. James’s faith in the two Bills as
powers, for good and the other for evil,
was tremendous. I don’t mind betting the
shadow got out of the box at Kurachi, but I
also wonder, if he really worked the mischief,
whqt good James’s death his done him.
There’s no orphanage for ventriloquists’ dum-
mies that I know of.
“Ike Pagliacci”: Fred Keeley, the Aus-
tralian who has been dancing through “the
East,” spent Armistice night at Hankow,
where he found Signor Carpi (the man who
had several. fingers in the Gonsalez Opera
Co.’s pie in this country), running an al fresco
show on the banks of the Yangtze-Iviang in
summer and in the Hotel de Ville of the
French concession in winter, and doing very
well out of the few hundred Europeans and
a few million Chinese. Keeley says the
Chow kid talks about Charlie Chap-a-lin, but
mostly knows him from the lithographs, the
high cost of rice preventing little Ah Too
Thin from spending money at the movies.
“Ancient Prompter”: The author of the
new Tait offering, “Daddies,” bears the un-
common surname of Hobble. Superstitious
theatrical folk (and all are more or less built
that way) will say there is a good deal in
a name if the piece doesn’t “run” well.
THE TERROR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Albert E. Huckerby, general secretary of the
Theatrical Employees’ Union, said, speaking of the
determination of the Government of Victoria to stop
the trams: ‘I do not wish to make any threat, but I
would state as a warning that the members of my
union have reached the limit of their patience.’ ”
Consider, Lawson, what you do!
Take thought of these grim men
With whom you’re dealing—villains who
Have stopped at nothing when
Weak virtue faltered in their way,
Or poor rich uncles, bent and grey,
Afforded them an easy prey.
Black fiends, each with a huge cigar,
Who’ve spilt the railway trains
To smash up virtuous heroes, are
The men whose evil brains
You’re up against! Take care, please do,
Or on a bolting sawmill you
May be severely cut in two.
If ruffians subordinate,
Rag-hatted and unshorn,
Be loosed to settle you, your, fate
A nation well may mourn.
They’ll tie yoif in a country gaol—■
Where prayers, dear sir, will nought avail—
Then light the powder in the bale.
Conspirators of Subtle guile
And revolutionists
Who sum their victims by the mile
This Huckerby enlists
To your undoing. Heed his rage,
Nor loose upon a quaking age
The bloody anger of the stage!

Why Should O 1C Saddle You
With an Unfair Responsibility ?
A BRIEF CHAT TO ADVERTISING MEN
\I7HEN you put the letters “ 0.K.” on the proof of a catalogue or
» » folder submitted to you by the printer, this means that you are
satisfied with the proof as presented; in other words you remove the
responsibility from the shoulders of the printer and take it on your own.
This is as it should be; because at some point or other in the transaction
the advertising man (or the buyer of printing) has to assume the liability for
the correctness or otherwise of the job. Generally speaking the 0.K..
applies only to the printed matter. It means that you are satisfied with
the type used, and with the general display; and that no grammatical or
literal errors have occurred in the copy.
But do you realise that after all this is only
one step in the direction of a perfect job?
The paper is just as important as the
type or the spelling. It is obvious that you
cannot expect the printer to pull a perfect
job in the rough; but if he can show you a
specimen of the paper he proposes to use,
printed with subject matter somewhat
similar to your own particular job, your
“0.K.” on the copy is a safe responsibility
to take, because in effect you haye a guarantee
that he will supply a job similar in all essential
details to the finished specimen.
Now how can you get this guarantee ? Ihe
answer is simple. Specify Warren’s Stan-
dard Printing Papers and ask to see
printed sheets, so that you can observe what
results can be achieved. Every printer who
buys Warren’s Standard Printing Papers gets
the top sheet in each case printed with a
typical subject, accompanied by details of
how the results were achieved. Warren’s
make thirteen different kinds of printing
papers, ranging from the beautiful toned dull
surface coated papers to the watermarked
antique finished olde style sheet. Let
Warren’s be your advisers on the printing
problem, for they have the experience of
thousands of printers to go upon ; and their
printed sample sheets are free on application
to their Australian Distributors,

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
BABY, CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Better than calomel, oil or pills to
clean and regulate liver,
bowels and stomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night, and in the
morning all the foul, constipated waste, sour
bile and fermenting food delayed in the
bowels gently moves out of the system. When
you awaken all headache, indigestion, sour-
ness, foul taste, bad breath, fever and dizzi-
ness are gone; your stomach is sweet, liver
and bowels clean, and you feel grand.
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—is a
family laxative. Everyone from grandpa to
baby can safely take it, and no one is ever
disappointed in its pleasant action. Millions
of mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, sick, feverish children. Ask
your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”—Cali-
fornia Syrup of Figs—which has directions
for babies, children of all ages, and for
grown-ups plainly on the bottle. Remember,
imitations are sometimes substituted, so look
and see that your bottle bears the name of
California Fig Syrup Company. Hand back
with contempt any other fig syrup. “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs—is sold by all
chemists in two sizes, 1/6 and 2/4. [7
The meeting at Moonee Valley last Satur-
day gave a further lift in interest to the imminent
Australian Hurdle Race. Waymea won the event
over the little sticks in a distinctly winsome style,
and the fact that it was only a two-mile go is not
to be taken into account as regards Holt’s mare, see-
ing that she is daughter of Carbinier, the sire of so
many noted stayers. With only 9st. 81b. dealt oat
to her for the long race, Waymea has a chance
almost equal to Beltane’s. Also Fastolf seemingly
surprised his friends by a brilliant finish in the
Jumpers’ Flat, suggesting: that last year’s winner of
the Australian Hurdle will be at his very best this
Saturday. Fastolf is raised 131 b. on his'last year’s
weight, but he is now only six years old, and his
breeding is a recommendation. The speedy Vaquero,
another of the first acceptances for both Hurdle and
Steeple, cut a prominent figure in a flat race-which
Court Jester won; also Captain W. coufirmed pre-
vious opinions of his quality as a hurdler. So the
books should get ample opportunity to make them-
selves safe on Saturday for the big race. The e are
about a dozen probabilities among the likely starters,
not to mention possibilities and forlorn hopes. It
seems reasonable to hare a preference for Beltane
and Waymea.
A dead-heat for the six furlongs snrirt at Moonee
Talley provided a run-off with a double change of
jockeys. Killorn took the place of Eaton on? Chal,
whilst Dempsey was substituted for Selbv n
Demonte. The difference in the result was probably
due to a slight Superiority in stamina on the part of
Chal, who got away with the lead both times. In
the first struggle Demonte got on terms with the
pace-maker and actually pushed his nose in front for
an instant, dropping back to level as they passed the
post. In the run-off Demonte never quite reached
Chal and was beaten by a neck—a shot neck at
that. Change of jockeys didn’t appear to matter
twopence.
* * * * i,
Ardlothan (N.S.W.) held a race-meeting
the other day which was a good entry for a
curiosity competition. Only eight horses put in an
appearance for five races, the biggest field being
four. The winner of this race beat the second
horse only by a short head; but he had so much
in hand that, after winning, he bolted five times
round the course before the jock could induce him
to face the weighing machine.
M * * *
Ex-handicapper Henry Hughes, of S.
Aus., was 81 last week. He still takes a great in-
terest in turf matters, and his son Charlie (who
now handicaps for most of the Adelaide metro-
politan meetings) often finds the ancient expert’s
advice valuable.
In the Warwick Farm Handicap on Satur-
day Urney tried to give 91b. to Varico, a useful nag
trained by H. J. Robinson. Apprentice Harry Lilly-
man was on Urney as usual. Brother Bill was
Varico’s passenger. And it was brother William
who won by a touch.

Admiral Collingwood, a two-year-old half-
brother by Trafalgar to Patrobas, raced in partner-
ship by Sam Hordern and M. Sheldon, made a first
appearance at Warwick Farm on Saturday, and
finished at the right end. The Admiral is a gelding.
He cost £472 last year. Saturday's racTT'was worth
£75.
* ♦ * *
The nags all have a birthday this week;
which means a lot of hard work for those which
were only two-year : old till yesterday. From Satur-
day they can start over all distances.
A trotting stallion that had done a lot of
travelling by rail and steamer, as well as by hoof,
had his last feed the other day in M.L. Mervyn
Wilkes was foaled in America and brought to Sydney
—an almost perfect square-gaited performer. After
racing in Sydney he tras bought for harem purposes
in M.L., re-purchased after a year or two for
N.S.W., and later acquired some more for the isles
where the trotting stakes given by provincial clubs
are higher than the stakes given by any racing club
in N.S.W. except the A.J.C.
From to-morrow (Friday) jocks at all
registered meetings in Victoria must wear officially -
approved skull-caps or sacrifice their mounts.
*** * *
liushcutter, who won the Hurdle at
Warwick Farm on . Saturday, had a half-brother by
Malster in Bimeter running in the next race (the
Pace Welter—6 furlongs) ; but he could get no
closer than third to Goonbilly, by Collarit (Paddy
Crick’s old winner), in lmin. 15see. Carrying 161 b.
less in January, at Rosehill, he created a course
record by running the distance in lmin. 13sec.

Entries for next year’s A.J.C. Breeders’
Plate show that more than half of the yearlings
nominated have not yet been named. Among the
colts that have, and that have nothing to complain
about on the subject, are Peroration (Kilbroney—
Flowery Speech), Epicure (The Sybarite—Dudu),
Fib (Popinjay—Peccadillo), Hop Off (Popinjay—
Let Slip), Reputable (Reputation—Lysbeth), and
Scarf (Featherstitch —Necktie). The fatuous coined
word, of course, abounds. For the Beragoon—Gemlet
t olt someone has perpetrated Gemaroon ; arid for the
Kilbroney—Golden Pippin colt, Kilpippin. Other in-
ventions are Coolmoor, Brightacre, Wise Syce, Cherry
Day, Rutarco (Varco —Rutine) and Barosca. Old
John Brown still sticks to the upper classes. Both
his nominations this yea>- are Princes. Among the
fillies in the Gimcrack the naming is no better. For
instance, Bunhaton for a lady b' r Powhaton from
Fremebunda, and Galmagne for a Charlemagne—
Galeria filly.

At the Adelaide Tattersall’s Club meeting
last Saturday there were so many entrants for the
Handicap Hurdles that it had to be run in two divi-
sions. Fourteen started in the first and 13 in the
second, and only two fell out of the lot. And in
Sydney the clubs have difficulty in scratching to-
gether for jumping events half a dozen weeds, any
one of which is liable to crash at the first obstacle.

During Derby week there was an aero-
plane service between London and Epsom carrying
passengers to and from the races. The fee was
£l2 10s. for four passengers.

“The Mug”: I’m enjoying the style of
some of the sporting scribes. “The Whisperer,” in
his “Turf Gabble,” informs those who follow his
tips that “Popoff, that gallant little mare, un-
expectedly met defeat last Saturday at the hands
of the black gelding Zulu.” Then he opens the
stable door of a successful sire to tell him that the
victory of one of his four-legged daughters in a
suburban scramble is “another feather in his cap.’
What sort of toques are the mares wearing this
year ?
* * * *
“G. Arden Hill”: Horse-racing appears to
be tottering on the N.S.W. South Coast. At the
Moruya race meeting held recently the attendance
was the lowest on record, and only two jockeys were
available. This meant that in every race except
two, in which an apprentice was risked on a third
mount, there were only two starters. Every event
on the programme was won by the favorite, ridden
by W. Linkenbagh. The odds are not mentioned, but
presumably the betting was feverish.
* * * *
In view of the news that Dempsey is to
get a million dollars to show on the cinema as
the conqueror of Willard, it seems all the rasher
for Carpentier to have agreed to meet McGoorty so
soon. McGoorty seems to be easily the hardest man
to beat in Europe just now. As a matter of fact,
till Darcy did the trick there was no one of
his weight that could be safely backed to do it
in the world. McGocrty’s war service—which was
in a gymnasium—has probably improved him, if
anything, and, though he is 30, Carpentier is nearly
26. Carpentier has everything to lose financially
■'from a defeat: he has not much to gain from a win
over McGoorty. It is as though the at-present idolised
Frenchman wagered 1,000,000 dollars to an average
London purse that he would beat the Yank; and
the odds in his favor are certainly nothing like
that.
Sid Calley (M.L.), k.o. by Eddie
Lynagh (Q.), at Brisbane Stadium, July 26, 1919.
So the event will figure in the record-books. Sid
passed into Dreamland in the 11th round, to the
gratification of all present.
The Waddy-Lloyd fight in Adelaide on
Peace night was the best that city has seen for
years. Waddy, the local man, who scaled 12st. 41b.,
was giving away 81b. and an inch or so in height
to “the Australian heavyweight champion.” For
the first three rounds he seemed to have all he
could do to smother Lloyd’s attacks, and the visitor
piled up points. After tha't the local man got very
busy, equalising matters rapidly. All through the
ninth and tenth there was hard punching on both
sides, and the referee called it a draw. It was the
best work Waddy has ever done.
* * * *
“Mooltan”: As a rule the men who run
boxing tents at country shows know a thing or two,
fbut one lot fell in badly in the Burnett (Q.) dis-
trict. The hard-face in front of the tent offered £5
to anyone who would stop two rounds with “Pro-
fessor Stoush, the champion heavyweight of Bara-
taria.” Many mugs had a go and went down. At
last an old grey-haired abo. strolled in and ex-
pressed a desire to put ’em on with the Professor.
In the first round the Professor was thinking hard,
in jthe second he was floored twice, and the crowd
cheered. Brother Binghi was Jerry Jerome.
George Mendies and George Eddy put up
a willing but poor fight for the flyweight champion-
ship of Australia at Sydney Stadium on Saturday
night. Eddy was untrained and Mendies was off-
color. Not once did Eddy look like winning;
and as early as the third round he might have
been outed had Menzies displayed a shade more
speed and enterprise. The referee stopped the
struggle and presented the victor’s bays to Mendies
in the 18th.

At the same trysting-place on Monday
night Tom Reeder, who is a hefty welter, utterly
extinguished Jack
Humphries, who is
properly speaking,
a lightweight, in
a round and a half
or less. As in his
last fight, Reeder
displayed a great
variety of hits and
all of them
were weighty.

A cricketer of the olden time, John Sweet-
nam, of Dennis Island, near Bathurst, has gone fur-
ther west at 73. One of the most prominent N. S.
Wales cricketers beyond the Blue Mountains, he
played in most of the big Western mashes and
twice against an All England Eleven. At one time
the Sweetnam family could and did put an eleven
in the field.

M. A. Noble was paid the highest compli-
ment of his cricketing career when, last week,
London Times picked him not only as the greatest
captain in the world, but as the greatest who has
ever lived. The Times included five Australians in
its XI of Elevens (Noble, Trumper, Hill, Spoff,
and Rlackham) and one Indian, who was, of course,
Ranji. Noble, by the way, was given a presentation
on Monday night by the N.S.W. Cricket Ass. to
commemorate his 25 years’ connection with the
game.

Minister Frank Clarke has arranged for
three courts at the Albert (Warehousemen’s)
Cricket Ground, St. Kilda-road, to be set apart by
the Melbourne C.icket Club for tennis. The courts
will be kept up by the club. The arrangement is
in the nature of a compromise. The Lawn Tennis
Association of Vic. wanted the whole or most of tiie
ground, but K.C.’s and others showed that there wee
statutory barriers to any Cromwellian procedure. The
Cricket Club was willing to make a strip on the
St. Ivilda-road side of the reserve available for four
courts, but the cost put the idea out of the question.
All concerned are pleased with the settlement, and,
instead of looking daggers, nod amiably to one
another.

The A.I.F. drew with Notts last week,
making 371 and 242 for five (innings declared
closed), as against 369 and 92 for one. Some of
the famous county’s best are still in Germany.
George Gunn, who played in Test cricket 10 years
ago, made 131. He is now 40: J. and W. are
respectively 43 and 61.

“Trot” : Before a lad is given a license to
ride the stipes have to be satisfied that he can at
least hang on. Prior to a trainer’s license being
issued certain evidence of capacity has to be pro-
duced. But a man can still start a horse in a
hurdle race without anybody bothering to know
whether the animal has had even a rudimentary
education in getting over timber. It is one ex-
planation of the poor class of 75 .per cent, of ihe
alleged hurdlers racing in Sydney now. No horse
should be allowed to start over the sticks without a
license, and the document ought to be withheld in
the case of any animal which has failed to perform
privately to the satisfaction of a competent judge.
Recent happenings at Randwick (where the entire
field fell) and at Warwick Farm on Saturday (where
three finished out of eight) suggest that failing a
change there will certainly be a holocaust.

In N.S.W. Rugby League’s round of
matches on Saturday Wests stopped the triumphal
march of Balmain (21—18). In eight previous
matches this season the worst that had befallen the
losers was a draw with Eastern Suburbs. Both sides
kicked six goals, and Wests scored three tries
against two. The star turn of the match was the
fine drop-kick goal bv White from nearlv half-way.
Also A. McPherson (Wests) put the ball five times
between the uprights. Elsewhere Easts defeated Glebe
I 5 —11; Souths walloped Annandale 18—10; and
Norths surprised Newtown by making a draw of it
10 points each. The day’s round evened up the
premiership table, and Balmain (15 points), Easts
(14 points) and Wests (12 points) are now all in
the running.
footballers gave Australia an-
other licking on Saturday—this time at Brisbane. The
score at the finish was 20—13, after the soldiers had
led by 14 0 in the first half. As a matter of fact,
they were lucky not to lose. There will be an
amalgamation of teams next Saturday. The N. S.
Wales lot will contain seven Diggers (Suttor will
be unavailable) ; and the Bananaland team will be
helped bv Ryan, Egan and Flanagan of the A.I.F.
o i n their game v. Saints on the
South Melbourne Cricket Ground last Saturday, put
up the most remarkable performance that has ever
been seen in Vic. League, or, probably, any other
variety of football. They scored 189 points to Saints’
18. They secured 29 goals—a thing that has never
been done before in a match between two teams of
class and during the last quarter they scored goals
at the rate of one every minute and a half. Robert-
son, with 14 goals off his own toe, established a
record for individual scoring in League ’ball.
This win leaves Souths well on top of the Pre-
miership list with a total of 36 points. ’Wood, which
beat Geelong (83 —31), and Richmond, which outed
Melbourne (72 —48) after a strenuous game, are
level, with four points less.

Queensland Rugby League XIII made
its 17th attempt to defeat N.S.W. at Sydney on
Monday, and for the 17th time it failed—on this
occasion by 12 points to 7. It was the nearest
thing to victory G. has ever achieved, the next best
being a 12 —3 defeat in 1908-9.

Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, after a
long run of success in sporting events with its old
rival St. Peter’s, went down badly in this year’s
football match. The play was not uneven, but the
Saints had the gift of straight kicking—especially
Rymill, who got 8 goals—and won by 15.11 to 8.15.
* * * *
Fine pitching by Harold Franks (Leich-
hardt) knocked Uni. (4 —0) for the fourth time in
Sydney baseball this season. The crash is a record
and suggests that the scholars might profitably be
shifted to a lower division.
On the first day (Saturday) of Queensland
Amateur athletic championship sjfbinter R. R. Bur-
s'll67' broke evens in the 100yds. The time given
was 9 9-10 sec., which equals the previous best in
Australia put up by Stan Rowley at Brisbane in
1899. Burguez won the championship la3t year in
10 l-ssec.

The revived N.S.W. novice cross-country
championship at Sydney on Saturday brought luck
to H. R. Turner (Botany Harriers). After two
miles, Tom Morris (Botany) and H. W. Sweeting
(South Sydney), who were in the lead, emulated the
heroine of melodrama and took the wrong turning.
By the time they realised their error there were five
ahead of them, and yet Morris finished only 40yds.
behind the winner, with G. Molloy third. Turner,
who is a fine striding youth of 18, did the alleged
five miles in 30min. 27 4-ssec. ; but as the track
shifts each year there is no way of getting at the
comparative merits of the different vears’ perform-
ances. The record belongs to P. Bland (Botany)
with 26min. 55sec. in 1915.
The 125,000 who saw the 500-mile auto
race on the speedway at Indianapolis (U,S.A.) on
May 31 got plenty for their money. At the 250-
mile post one car turned over while moving at 90
miles an hour. The driver went to the morgue,
arid the mechanist to the hospital. Another car
skidded and turned over. Leeocq and Bandini, who
were strapped to their seats, were burned to death,
rescue being delayed because other racers were thun-
dering through the flames and picking un the burn-
ing gasoline, which was distributed all over the
speedway. Lecocq, who was 26, overturned in a
big race last year. Bandini was only 21, and had
just inherited a million dollars. The prize of
20,000 dollars went to Wilcox, who finished the
trip in 5 hr. 44 min., including stops for tyres and
“gas.” I-lis average speed was 81.12 m.p.h. The
second man was only 3 min. behind.

“Gustavus Gravelpit” : I regret to have to
announce that China—most conscientious and scrupu-
lous trader amongst the nations, I have always been
led to believe—is taking a hand in the profiteering
game. ■ I am by way of being a fisherman, and for
some considerable time have procured my bait
from a vegetable-John, he allowing me to dig for
worms in a portion of his garden, which worms he
sold me at 6d. the imperial pint. Last week the
price went up to a shilling. I inquired “Whaffor?”
Impassively the yellow man replied: “Allee same
big war make ’em welly dear.”

The death of billiardist George Gray was
lately reported in a London sporting paper’s
cable news. He hasn’t any pet ailments to accourft
for the rumor; and in all respects young George
appears to be as well as ever. But how his star
has waned! He is playing- exhibition games with
his father in Melbourne, whilst his old enemy, Mel-
bourne Inman, is buying racehorses on the other side.
The veterans of England eliminated
S’Africa from the Davis Cup competitions with great
ease last week. Meanwhile the best of the Austra-
lians are leaving England to take part in the U.S.
tennis championships, as though to show the Yanks
that their chivalry in not challenging for the Davis
Cup this year, “on account of the losses suffered by
Australia in the war,” was much exaggerated.
The Sydney v. Manly match in the A
grade tennis premiership- final on Saturday was a
black day for the Andersons. Norman Peach de-
feated N. S. Wales champion Jim (10-8, 6-3) ; ft.
Neil outed Clarence (6-2, 6-2) ; and Eric Pockley
wiped the courts with R.O. (6-3, 6-1). Sydney’s
success (by 4 rubbers 8 sets to nil) was its third
successive win in these competitions.
Details of the remarkable relay mile at
Stamford Bridge (Lon.) with international teams
show that the Maorilanders, who won, were D. L.
Mason (first J. Wilton G-mile), and H. E.
Wilson and J. Lindsay (each 220yds.). It was
touch-and-go with the English four throughout, but
Lindsay got home by about a yard. Time, 3min.

HIS DREAM,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“We must make Melbourne a place where it is
unsafe for people to go out after 7 o'clock at night.”
— Strike-specialist Walsh.
I dreamt a gracious thing last night:
The city streets were dark ;
No gleam of light appeared at all
In house or square or park.
“Now let the sport begin,” I heard
A Bolshevik remark.
Homeward, in furtive twos and threes,
The bourgeois workers fled,
While after them, like angry bees,
Our rifle-bullets sped.
Some leapt and screamed in fear or pain;
Some faltered and fell dead.
Secure behind Ihe bags we lay
And dropped them at our ease:
Their cries came pleasingly to us
Upon the evening breeze,
And through it all our fusillade
Wept on without surcease.
The fusillade went on because
It was as safe for us
As for our bourgeois quarry it
Was deadly dangerous.
We shot so many, old and young,
It grew monotonous.
And all the while, through smashed-in doors,
AVhere bolder ones had gone,
Came other cries—-the cries of girls
Who fought unhelped, alone,
Because their men-folk, in the dark,
Lay still and cold as stone.
I woke and wept to find the town
A flood of garish light;
The street below was bright as day
Although it Still was night ;
And a large policeman paced his beat,
And no one dared to light.
I wept to think the Bolshevik
May never sport by day:
He needs the friendly help of night
To make it safe to slay;
And a few paltry lamps suffice
To keep him from his prey.
N.S.W.

were sufferers from indigestion, constipation and other dis-
orders which are the direct result of the internal muscles
being much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.

Governor Stanley was extensively fare-
welled and feasted in the week before his
departure for England via Adelaide. The
most notable gathering was the dinner
given, nominally by the Victorian Parlia-
ment, really by the taxpayers. So that lie
might not forget his four Premiers (Watt,
Peacock, Bowser and Lawson), Peacock,
who supported the chief toast, gave him this
list to aid his memory—“Plugger Bill,”
“Laughing Alec,” “Solid John” and “Genial
Harry.” Bowser, in disavowing any resent-
ment against his Ex. for refusing him a
dissolution in March, 1918, ventured to sug-
gest that Stanley sympathised with him.
John stressed this point by recalling the
yarn of the Cold Country meenister who
told a controversial kirk elder that the
Aumichty had to do many things in his
offeecial capacity that he would scorn to do
in his private capacity. Manifold and
Mackey, as the official heads of the two
Houses, threw each a stone on the cairn of
commendation; but the 'heartiest cheers of
the evening came when a veiled suggestion
was thrown out by Peacock that Stanley
might return some day as Governor-General,
as Hopetoun did after serving a similar
apprenticeship. Irvine, C.J., was there,
but was a silent guest.
Premier Lawson, who presided, wore a
halo in the shape of a bandage, and also when
he spoke at the Gaud Mayor’s send-off to
his Ex. on the following day. The halo
was neatly placed by Surgeon-General
Plevna Ryan to secure the dressing over the
wound caused by the coward who hurled an
inkstand at him when the ruction was on at
the State public offices. By the way, while
standing up to that hostile crowd Lawson
looked more like the football player that he
used to be than he generally does. There
were moments when he seemed to be on the
point of forgetting his Premiership, his son-
ship of the manse, and his responsibility as
the father of eight children, and trying a
dirtv left on the jaws of a couple of his
tormentors.
The farewell speeches of Sir Arthur came
a little more trippingly off his tongue than
those he made in the pre-war days, when he
was a novice in vice-regality; yet the manner
and matter of his discourse hadn’t. changed
to speak of. He was the most academical
of Excellencies. He had learned his art of
oratory in the school that Dickens' satirised,
Where the earnest pupil is taught to begin
a whole series of sentences with one com-
bination of sounds —such as “When I re-
member this; when I remember that; and
when I remember the other”; or “My im-
pressions of this young city; my impressions
of this great city; my impressions of this
rich city, with its grand future, with its
wonderful future, with its illimitable future.”
The idea in most speechmaking seems to be
to spread it thin, like potted cheese.
For Governor Stanley’s last appearance
on Wednesday last the Vi-torian Division
of the Red Cross Society had the beautiful
panelling of the Town Hall Council Room
covered with flags. Downstairs the big doors
were strongly guarded by Diggers while
his Ex’s motor sang a lullaby -to itself, in
the portico. The meeting, v.hicjh had been
boomed as an important one for Red
Crossers, resolved itself mainly into a
mutual admiration society. The air was
full of compliments and applause, and the
workers could gather no crumb of informa-
tion as to what work was to be done in the
future. The departing Governor blandly
remarked that the Red Gross women could
rest now. as no more pyjamas were needed.
An agitated rustling swept through the audi-
ence ahd mufterings were heard :' “Pyjamas,
indeed ! Why, wp are short, of pyjamas—
we need hundreds of them 1” One woman
whispered fiercely, “If he lmd said socks,
now, there would be some sense in it. We
are swamped yith socks.” But the oratorical
Governor swept on. shedding needed pyjamas
all over the landscape. He’ll be very lucky
if somebody doesn’t report it to the Colonial
Office.
The G.-G. £nd Helen, also the
Irvines, have, promised to bless the big
’Varsity bpll in September. The function
is a sort of welcome tp the shop’s returned
soldiers, and sailors. The professorial wives
have formed a sub-committee, and are work-
ing up the rOvel. i
Liidy IFplen’s :pet , association, the Friendly
Union of Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers, had
a music-and-refreshments rally in the
Masonic Hall last week. Lieut. Prentice
made a speech, Theophilus Roberts arranged
the nrogramme, and Mavis Cunninghame
supplied the piano accompaniments. The
printed programmes were enlivened by ad-
vertisements for cook-generals who must be
wives or widows of soldiers. Applicants
were invited to bring along the child, if
any.
When President Wilson of Paris was
visiting New York just before the armistice,
some Australian visitors saw him fre-
quently. Always Woodrow walked inside a
square of blue-uniformed guards. When he
walked the square walked; when he stopped
the square stopped. Favored people—one
at a time —were allowed inside the square
for a word or a brief interview; but Mr.
President was never seen out of the centre.
General Birdwood has presented to George
V. an Australian horse which did some fine
service in France, and belonged to a Vic.
officer of high rank who was invalided home.
The Vic. officer is said not to be too pleased
at Birdwood having apticipated his wishes.
He thinks he might have been asked to
apnoint “Birdy” his proxy in making the
presentation.
Yet another imported Anglican, Harring-
ton Lees, of Cambridge, is to spread the
light in this country at a high salary. Lc-s
comes out to fill the shoes of lovable only
John Langley, who has retired from the
bishopric of Bendigo after 12 years’ service.
As. usual, the Bishopric Election Board whs
quite unanimous about the matter, onfce the
usual representations had been made from
the Right Quarter.
Horace Lansell, a son of the golden Lan-
sells of Bendigo, dumped his Digger’s kit
into Scott’s Hotel last week and proceeded
to a delightful inspection of baby Lansell,
who was only a few months old when the
head of the family departed for France.
Mrs. (General) Hughes, who has gone
to England, was president of the Friendly
Union of Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers; and
Mrs. (General) Sellheim has been unani-
mously elected her successor. The new
chairlady was voted the most untiring
worker the Association knows.
Mrs. J. Gillies, the handsome Melbourne
girl whom her friends knew as Lea Halin-
bourg and theatre-goers as Leonora Hallin,
is back after a long spell of war-work in
England. Her husband (they had just been
married) died the best kind of death in
France.
Another interesting young woman who
has returned after many years is “Pat” Rus-
sell. On the title-page of sundry novels
(which mostly take the form of solemn
warnings against the Scarlet Woman) she
is Lindsay Russell, and sometimes Harling-
ham Quin, while on her visiting-cards she
is Mrs. lan Scott, and her address is Harley-
street. Her doctor-husband will join her in
November.
Modesty forbids
V. B. Trapp to
mention his full re-
coi’d of activity on
behalf of Australia,
but he won’t; mind
a reference .to his
great work in re-
vealing the superior
virtues of Australian
timber. Years ago
he worked with the
late David Sjme in
making forestry a
live subject, and one
of their first achieve-
ments was the ap-
pointment of a com-
mission to consider
tree-planting and
preservation in Vic-
toria. All the time V. B. Trapp was pour-
ing forth his faith in the local woods with
an enthusiasm worthy of a larger audience.
A while back he helped to found the Gum
Tree, a bright little quarterly devoted to his
hobby, and it is now serving as ammunition
for the Australian Forest League. Trapp,
who is here pictured by Gainsborough, of
Prahran, was the first to advocate the re-
moval of the unsightly fences from Mel-
bourne parks and gardens. He is a Mel-
bourne native, and in his youth figured as
an inter-State cricketer.
Again a little damsel named Macpherson
figures in Melbourne law reports. The
famous Kathleen of old had lost both
parents ere the lawyers argued her case, but
the Mary Violet Thornley Macpherson of this
new dismite has a Canadian major papa,
who wants to recover her from the care of
his sister in Victoria. Auntie gets £2OO a
year from the maternal grandfather’s estate
for the maintenance of Mary, and sends her
to the Ladies’ Grammar School at Geelong:
but papa, having done his bit in the war,
proposes to take her off t& Canada to live
with his second wife, who had charge of her
awhile some years ago. A writ of habeas
corpus —good old habeas corpus! —comes
due next week. But why does romance thus
weave itself around the clan MacphairsonV
Dr. Greville, formerly of South Melbourne,
and previously of Albury and Westralia, died
last week in Gippsland, where he had re-
tired from busy practice. The deceased
doctor, who was of the genial sort, had a
theatrical father—the late J. R. Greville.
Old people never spoke of him without men-
tioning his relationship to Greville the actor.
Harpist Louise
Metters is an in-
tensely musical Aus-
tralian who gained
all her knowledge
in Australia. Years
ago she was a Mar-
shall Hall Conser-
vatorium girl, and
played a viola in the
Master's orchestra.
But her keenest
study is the harp :
and as she also pos-
sesses a voice she is
reviving the old art
of singing to the
harp, so recapturing
some of the lost
charm that pervaded
drawing-rooms in
the 18th century. Violinist Hjalmir
Josephi, who used to be so conspicuous a
figure in the Marshall Hall days, has been
helping Louise in her harp ambitions. Some
promising recitals had been projected by
these two, but they had to be postponed
when the songster-harpist was stricken with
’flu. This portrait of Miss Metters is by
Alice Mills.
At a recent ball for school-girls the cloak-
roof was provided not only with pins and
powder, but with rouge, and this the flappers
simply waded into between dances. Gram-
mar School boys, who provided the male
element, sat smoking cigarettes, languidly
magnificent, on the balcony when they felt
too blas§ to jazz. The children wbuld do
well to take an example in flirtatious foie de
vivre from their grand-parents.
A Squab Dinner was given at the Oafd
Anglaise on Saturday night. A very big
affair in point of numbers, it was the Utility
Pigeon Breeders’ second annual banquet.
Last year, at the first pigeon dinner, there
were only 40 members in the Association.
On Saturday there were nearly 200. The
long tables were decorated with snowdrops,
decorated menu cards and solemn faces.
Just before the eating began all the electrics
went out, and stayed out for 20 minutes.
Some of the elders present filled in the time
with prayer as well as fasting.
Latest gas regulations are the unkindest
cut of all, especially to those few unfavored
householders who have been fined, without
the option of appeal, for burning gas during
“prohibited hours.” They were victimised,
a J ra^ es way of speaking, seeing
that the Gas Co. afterwards admitted that
tens of thousands of other people had ignored
the prohibition, “and the difficulty was to
detect those guilty of such infringement.”
As for the new regulations;—no more pro-
hibited hours, but each consumer is re-
stricted to one-half the quantity of gas re-
corded on the same premises this time last
year! Why, the bitter cry of the good,
honest, economical consumer is that the
meter record varieth not, no matter how
much the gas taps are turned off! One
can’t sit in train or tramcar these times
without hearing the word “Scandalous!”
snorted at large,
. T ll ® eldest daughter of Weigall, K.C.,
electrified the National Council of Women
by actively opposing Mrs. Spencer’s motion
to iollow Canada’s League and refuse to be
associated with the women of Germany
“until repentance had been shown.” Miss
YVeigall said she did not see what progress
there could be if we refused to recognise
Germany. She herself would not object <o
take the hand of a German woman There
was a chorus of “Oh !” and then a woman
who had been in 11 air raids told her story
of slain children. That settled it. The
motion was carried.
Squatter George Howat, who passed out
Jast week after just completing his 75th
year, was a familiar figure in Melbourne,
where he was a stock and station agent De-
tore going in for sheep properties. He had
a nice, old-fashioned . mansion at Parkville
facing Koyal Park. On returning from a
visit to England 24 years ago, bulging with
information of value to graziers and agricul-
turists, he did not know how to unload it
when a pressman was sent to interview him.
He staited to praise the London policeman
and deprecate the crooked streets. The re-
porter then closed his notebook and drilled
tor the ore he was after. Howat told him
he was no than a dentist ; but the
result urns O.K.
One minor result of the strike is the
cutting out of sleeping-berths between Mel-
bourne and Adelaide. A sleeper carries 20
passengers, an ordinary carriage 75; so all
parties now sit up and gloat (or otherwise)
over the “triumph for democracy.”
Few women piled up a more unselfish re-
cord of personal service in the ’flu epidemic
than Tripper Musgrove, youngest sister of
the late George. Although not a trained
nurse and of frail physique, she offered her
services in Melbourne, and did priceless
work in several cases. Years ago Miss Mus-
grove was the partner of Miss Jennie
Brenan in Perth, where the two girls went
to teach the Westralian flappers the
mysteries of the time’s equivalent of the
tickletoe.
Young Louis Pirani has just got success-
fully through an attack of appendicitis. The
doctor had to limit the popular young man’s
visitors to six pretty girls ner diem.
A Melbourne tenor always patronises the
same shavery. The barber recently put up
ins prices and this shocked the singer.
“Would you charge me extra?” he gasped.
“You know I attract custom.” But the
unfeeling barber smilingly told him that '.n
his case the assistants really wanted to
charge extra for acreage. “It means a
shave for three chins for you,” explained
Lather.
The dental students are founding a
memorial scholarship as a tribute to the
mates who will never come home, and the
proceeds of last week’s dance in the
Prahran Town Hall will help the project on.
The tickets were half a guinea, and 600
people turned up to fox-trot. Decorations
were peach-blossom branches and mist-blue
draperies. There was a set for debutantes,
who blossomed out happily in blush-rose and
white, and carried pink rose posies.
Adelaide hears the tramp of thousands:—
We are all footsore. No trams except for a couple
of hours in the early morning and late afternoon,
while over our heads hangs the threat that all cook-
ing by gas will be forbidden next week unless the
consumption is reduced by 50 per cent. Occasional
char-a-bancs bump in and out of most of the
suburbs; but their prices are as elevated as them-
selves.
The City Council has announced its intention of
removing the tin and plaster Bank of Thrift from
the North Terrace-King William-street corner. It
was an item of the Seventh War Loan publicity
campaign, and the novelty wore off it long ago.
The committee of the Army Nurses’ Fund 4 s
arranging a conference between its own trustees, the
nurses’ committee and representatives of the Army
nurses to decide its future policy. Of the £7OOO
in hand £4OOO is earmarked to give assistance to
returned nurses. It is the fate of the remaining
£3OOO that has to be decided.
Dr. Melville Jay, who has been gravely ill fir
some weeks, has improved sufficiently to be moved
from the hospital to his own home.
The inter-collegiate football match, pushed on a
day so that the Oval would be free for Peace Day
festivities on Saturday, brought St. Peters' a 37-
point victory—their first for seven years. In the
evening there Was the Prince Alfred Old Collegians’
dinner, with the Governor and scores of returned red-
and-white Diggers as the principal guests.
The Public Library Board has made a special
record of the good work done by Miss Harwood.
Since 1912 she has been deputy-general secretary,
and at her own suggestion that billet is now to go
to H. W. Marshall, another member of the staff wno
put in two years’ service with the A.I.F.
Captain Percy Dobson, lately back from
the war, will cross to .the Speck when the
strike permits to bestow a gold ring on 'his
Hobart fiancee Coralie Flexmore. The
bridegroom-elect is a son of late barrister
Frank Dobson.
The Greenroom Clubmen who organised
the annual pilgrimage to Lindsay Gordon’s
grave are sticking to their first purpose of
erecting an equestrian statue on the ground.
During the war the collection was given to
the Red Cross, but from now on it will go
to swell the £350 held by ■ the Equity
Trustees Co. towards the statue fund. The
first Sunday in October is the day appointed
this year for the celebration. Senator Rus-
sell and representatives of the A.L.S. and
A.N.A. have been invited to talk, and Ned
Duggan and Margaret Sutcliffe will recite
Gordon poems.
Big Ruby Reynolds, sister of the re-
turned Anzac colonel of that name, has
made a sudden nlunge into the mumming
limelight. 1 She is a handsome, dressy
matron in “The Tailor-made Man” with a
line or so to say. She and Emma Temple
are inseparable companions, but hitherto
Ruby has been content to keep the home fires
burning whilst Emma anted. Perhaps the
coal shortage made the wait in the front
parlor too dreary. ■ .
Mi's. Ted Tait went triumphantly through
the ’flu season in America, and survived 'the
worst of the Sydney epidemic without catch-
ing a germ. But she get her share of the
curse just as her husband got home from a
year abroad. The small dressy lady is now
well enough to cheer the Oriental with some
American frocks these grey afternoons.

THE SYDNEY AGENT FOR THE MILL IS
EMPOWERED TO REDEEM THIS GUARANTEE
TO THE MERCHANT. [2
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
A tidal wave of glad millinery surged up
the Town Hall stairs, each ripple decked with
three square feet of invitation from Mayoress
Richards to meet Lady Helen. Mrs. Rich-
ards matched pink roses and carnations
against the soft brown of chiffon velvet; and
Lady Helen’s smile gained in sweetness from
the violets clasped before the blue of her
velvet and crepe de chine dress. With the
vice-regal pressure still warm upon their best
white gloves, the guests bore into the nearest
group where a familiar face greeted them.
Everybody stood about and watched her
neighbors while they commented on the
beautiful masses of pea and roses used in the
decoration scheme. Ex-Agent-General Cogh-
lan’s lady was charming in black ; the Barton
title was ably supported in mole cloth ; and
the McMillan dame was gladsome in petunia.
Handsome Mrs. Rolin was in black. The brim
of Mrs. Holman’s wide liat made efforts to
reach past her shoulder-blades. In one corner
there was a Hordern strong post; noticeable
in this group was Mrs. Willie Anderson,
with her fair hair and wonderful ermine
wraps. Mrs. Harrison repatriated herself
with a glad' smile; Mrs. Mark Sheldon wore
navy ; Deputy-Town-clerkess Layton wore the
softest of nigger brown. Poland was upheld
by Mrs. G. Earp’s blue and black frock, while
Japan’s little Consulina murmured farewells
from the depths of mole cloth.
Librarian Ifould tells you very proudly
that. the whole of the detail of the Public
Library Exhibition in the Education Gal-
leries was planned and carried out by his
staff of women assistants. The Exhibition
embodies a great display of trade and com-
mercial literature of vital interest to the
business woman or man—perhaps more to
the woman, because her initial education has
not gone to develop the commercial grey-
cells. It isn’t all trade-catalogues. There
are wonderful examples of printing, starting
with beautiful illuminated missals of the
monks of old, and running on to the Edition
de luxe of to-day, which is as close an
imitation as possible of the earliest hand-
printing. Howe, the first printer in Aus-
tralia, did his work well; some of it is
shown dating back to 1801, and, despite* the
poor materials, bearing the test of time well.
But it is the value of the more practical side
of the library that Mr. Ifould wishes to drive
home: the institution is not only a store-
house of dead treasure, but touches each walk
in life chosen by girl or boy. To-night
(Thursday) is set aside for business-women;
seven-thirty's the hour.
Young things crowded Sydney Town Hall
floor and whispered in the galleries on Friday
when the Old Boys of Church of England
Grammar School gave their hop. Head-
master Purves and Mrs. Purves brought
daughter Joyce in the softness of pink
georgette; and Mrs. Davies, whose husband’s
memory is treasured in the hearts of
Old Boys, had with her Gwendolyn, in blue,
and Olwen, in pink. The Camerons, from
Turramurra, brought a daughter in gold net
and a niece in white tulle; Mrs. Roberts
wore black, with a dash of blue in the
corsage; Mrs. Heath’s black frock had reared
a family of red butterflies; Mrs. Randal
Carey weighted down her frock with je:;
Cora Randal Carey wore gold tissue; and
handsome Mrs. Herbert Kendall, in white
tulle, beguiled her little set with the softest
tongue in the world. President Russell
Sinclair brought Mrs. Sinclair in black tulle.
By the way, Dr. Herbert Kendall is proud
of the fact that his name was the first on
the books of the school. The Memorial Play-
ing Ground should face the bill of costs with
a mind more at ease.
The little church on the hill at Menangle,
where the Macarthur Onslows’ pew has a
box-view of the altar, heard the vows of
daughter Helen Maud and Captain Stanham
on Saturday. Some narcissi on the altar
and bowls of arum-lilies at the end of the
church were the only floral decorations, but
the seats in the body of the church bloomed
with expensive fur and feather-millinerv.
The _ wedding ceremony was, with the ex-
ception of a little assistance lent by Padre
Micklem, of St. James’s, done wholly in the
family. Rev. Cecil King, who tied the
knot is a cousin; cousin Anita (in navv
frockmg) drew the strains of “The Voice’’
and “O Perfect Love” from the small cottage
organ, the first sung (in different keys) by
the wedding guests, the latter soloed by
bride’s brother Jim, a lieutenant in the
16th Queen’s Lancers, while the register
was being signed with a gold pen.
Not entering the church, but grouping
themselves on the path outside, the tenantry
watched for the bridal procession. The
bride had draped herself in folds of exquisite
chiffon velvet, opening over an underdress
of georgette, cut so narrow that it necessi-
tated -the up-to-the-moment sashing. Add
to this a court train, a string of pearls from
dad, several acres of Iloniton lace veil that
had been worn by mother, and an armful
of orchids from Camden Park, and you have
an idea of the picturesque girl-bride’s ap-
pearance. Sister Betty, three small cousins
(E’aith, Robina and Margaret) and slim
Cecily Cattrall, all in White georgette and
gold tissue, clutching pink and white carna-
tions, followed the bridal train. The invited
guests climbed into motors and drove to the
exclusiveness of Gilbulla, where the Colonel
and Mrs. Macarthur Onslow gave the glad
hand, and Lady Helen Munro Ferguson
smiled vice-regal approval from navy crSpe
de Chine and velvet. Miss Macarthur
Onslow upheld the dignity of Camden Park
in richly-embroidered mole chiffon, with a
wide mole hat. Brig.-General Macarthur
Onslow brought Mrs. Onslow in fawn tailor-
ings and skunk furs.
There were Onslows everywhere, with a
Knox or two thrown in for balance; the
Streets and the Gordons; the Gordon
Wesches; Cattralls, Laidleys, Massies,
Finns, J. O. Fairfaxes and D’Apices—these
and more partook of the wedding meats in
the pavilion on the lawn, where the bride
cut the almond-icing with her hero’s sword.
Among the gifts, the ltussian leather
writing-case from the Arthur Allens, the
travelling clock from the Iven Austins, the
crystal from Surgeon MacCormick’s wife and
daughters, and the amber necklet from Mrs.
Henderson were very worthy a burglar’s
attention. A feature of the collection were
the fans —a black ostrich-feather one from
Lady Helen, another of lace and tortoishell,
and a charming one of ivory. There were
lots of cheques, myriads of sweet-dishes, tor-
toiseshell accessories and more gold and
silver cigarette-cases than any one girl
could wear out in three lifetimes.
The bride set forth on the trip to Moon-
bara, the Arthur Allens’ Port Hacking honey-
mooners’ camping-place, clad in cherry-
colored cloth with a beaver hat and muff.
The Osterley carries the Stanhams to Eng-
land, where the reciprocal gifts of the bride
and groom are to fye purchased.
In the afternoon the tenantry (by Royal
Command) made its way to the big house,
and by half-past two Menangle village was
a solitude possessed by an elderly man lead-
ing a subdued horse home. In the village of
Menangle the only apparent recreation is
furnished by a tennis-court. Beer nor the
movies have a place on its hallowed soil. Nor
are there trees planted along the road which
the cottages face. In the summer-time it
must be an eye-wearying street; but Gilbulla
is surrounded by pleasant lawn and garden-
plot and wide stretches of tree country.
And so:
God bless the Squire and his relations,
And keep us in our proper stations.
Home lately by the Roda, bringing her
Royal Red Cross with her, Sister A.
R. Paton, daughter
of the late Rev.
James Paton, of
the Petersham kirk,
and of Mrs. Paton,
now of Mosm a n.
Her war service ran
the full term. Holi-
daying in England
when the nations
began to “furiously
rage,” Sister Paton,
who had graduated
at Prince Alfred,
threw in with Queen
Alexandra’s Nurs-
ing Reserve. Two
years’ service in
Woolwich Military
Hospital gained her
the Royal Cross,
to'which she was pinned at Buckingham in
1916. The military hospital at Salonika
was her next care, and the signing of the
Armistice found her in the frigid region of
Cremona tending wounded Austrians and
Italians.
The Mary Elizabeth supplied the farewell
sandwich tendered to Mrs. Mark Sheldon
and the girls by the Tuesday Workers of
the Red Cross Book Depot. The tables
were all yellow and bronze, and the guests of
honor carried away a brown-covered auto-
graph-book in which were the names of the
30 workers whom Mrs. Sheldon and Mrs. F.
Anderson had pressed into the Tuesday ser-
vice.
At the Mark Sheldons’ party last week
there were dances for the older set while
flapper charges were at supper. Somebody
suggested a waltz ; that led to a galop; and
the evident delight of Mrs. Toohey and Frank
Coffee as they moved over the floor in the
old-time dances was a reproach to the set
expression that the new dances have intro-
duced.
The ball in aid of Sydney Hospital is
already under weigh. Lady Davidson is
president, and a committee has been formed.
The date is hovering between the 12th and
the 15th of August, it being hoped that the
Jellicoes may be snared for gold bait.
Tickets, £1 Is.; address, the Town Hall.
The event has been christened The Peace
Offering Ball, and the decorations are to he
in blue and white —the League of Nations’
colors.
The indefatigable humanitarians, Mrs.
Toohey and Miss Egan, have interested
Lady Davidson in the Waitara Foundling
Home, run by the Sisters of Mercy, and last
week when she paid it a visit the tiny tots
received her with flags of greeting. Lady
Davidson has promised to open the annual
fete on August 13.
Lieut.-Commander C. Webb is at present
one of the R.A.N. destroyer captains. As
an R.N.R. man he joined the Encounter at
the outbreak of war
and was transferred
to the destroyer
Huon, which was his
spray-dashed home
for three vears. From
police duty in the
Pacific the destroyer
hurried t o the
Adria t i c, where
everybody was kept
busy dropping depth
charges on sub-
marines and rescu-
ing troops and
civilians from tor-
pedoed steamers.
There were some
bad hours on that
job. Once there was
a mutiny amongst
Greek and Italian troops on a torpedoed
transport. The captain, knowing he had
just enough steam to do it, decided to run
the ship ashore. But the men got in a
panic and massacred every responsible
officer aboard. Then, while the troops
fought amongst themselves, the ship, with
nobody at the helm, steered itself in a circle
for just the length of time it would have
taken to reach the beach. When it slowly
sank it took down 900 men. Only 150 were
saved.
Patrick Church is the name of the young-
est mite at the Waitara Homo. The visitors
the other day heard the story of his naming.
One morning the priest who was to say early
mass at St. Patrick’s discovered on the
church steps a bundle which turned out to
be a lusty baby-boy. So when the baptismal
waters were poured upon the little chap’s
head, the priest gave him the name of the
tabernacle, and added Church for a sur-
name.
The Rix Nicholas farewell by the Council
of the Women Painters was one of last
week’s successes. The Club rooms were
crammed with admirers of the lady’s art;
and three of the canvases from her exhibi-
tion were ipagnets which drew groups all
the afternoon. A few male members of tie
brush trade had turned out to say bravo.
Dattilo Itubbo brought his best red tie and
a staccato of praise; Julian Ashton made a
charming speech to the tall and perfectly-
groomed young lady, who was supported by
a brother-in-law. Mrs. Holman loosed on
approvingly while her Premier turned a
chapter of flowery words: Mrs. Sherwood’s
bright eyes danced ; and “Art in Australia”
was renresented by Bertram Stevens.
Another tea-drinker farewelled was
Japanese Consul Shimizu’s little wife, who
arrived at the party at the Carlton in steel-
grey tailorings with a bonnet to match. The
committee of the Rose Ball presided over the
tea-tables, and Mrs. Hugh D. Mclntosh
handed over a perfectly gorgeous flower-
bed of crimson carnations and tuberose and
hyacinth. _ Madame has associated herself
closely _ with the work of the committee,
which is out for funds to help the Royal
Hospital for Women and the Ren wick ditto
for Infants.
Consul Shimizu and his wife gave a good-
bye luncheon at the Australia, and sweet
pea and fern and golden streamers rested
the eye between courses. Poland was re-
presented by the Earps; America by the
Brittains, whose own departure has been
again postponed. Lecturer Oliver Bain-
bridge was another guest.
The Sep Levys have bought the Harry
Levys’ house, Hillside, for £BOOO. This does
not include the surrounding ground, which
is being sold —at £29 or so a foot, with pur-
chasers clamoring for more.
The evergreen Mrs. Sep Levy keeps her
heels and her heart young. The new order of
the menage is dancing on Sunday afternoons,
after tennis. The balls are kept flying till
four; then comes tea; then jazz until six.
Oh, well, they’ll be dead for such aeons; and
if they come back a second time it might
be as bandicoots or laundry-workers.
Mrs. Nelson and daughter Gwen arranged
still another farewell to Mrs. Shimizu, and
their tea-party at the Australia was a
happy, informal little affair. The film in
which Gwen made her debut in the U.S.A.
is to be screened almost immediately in
Sydney.
St. John’s College has issued cards for
its dance on August 5.
Tom Dalton has placed his beautiful home
at Burradoo at the disposal of the Lewisham
nuns, so many of whom were laid up with
the influenza; several of them paid tue
ultimate price. The Reverend Mother is
still very ill—a brilliant woman with a
knowledge of the arts as intimate as her
knowledge of the sick-room.
The Gilbert Grahams look out over the
peace of Watson’s Bay and wonder if their
Berlin experiences could have been real—till
their eyes rest upon the two paintings of
the Ruhleben camp done by Mr. Graham
while he was interned. One of these
depicts a scene from “School for Scandal”
as acted by one of the Camp’s dramatic
clubs. There were two play-acting schools.
The Arts and Sciencers considered them-
selves the highbrows of the camp, and their
object was to produce the most advanced of
problem plays. They were mostly vcrv
young men.
Mrs Graham was for a year in Berlin
after the war started. She found that the
Englishwoman who remained unobtrusive
was not interfered with. She went about
freely, and when at length she decided to
go to England she gave a month’s notice to
the authorities, excluded all printed and
written matter from her luggage, and made
the journey without much' disagreeableness.
Airs. Graham is a sister to Eirene Alort, the
clever Arts and Crafts girl.
The most popular thing aboard the Aus-
lalia just now is Captain Cumberlege’s
thoroughbred black Pom. She has made
when \°J a fa Wi n h him ’ f tartin s in the days
w . en i} e bad charge of a destroyer, lie
picked her up this time at Colombo, where
she had been tearfully left by the Sydney
gad to whom she originally belonged. " Pom
had been abandoned them on account of the
ngid Commonwealth legislation against the
admission of dogs from foreign parts.
.There are two Generals in the family of
od District Court Judge McFarland, dead
\ T many y e ar s. One daughter married
Alec Jobson, who had a short reign at the
rl'™} as TT a brigadier; another' married
Ryrie, M.11.R. and Major-General, who has
seen more war service than any other Aus-
tralian legislator. By the way, if the actual
ar record of some of those legislators was
produced there would be gasps among them
constituents.
~.I t was a famous woman who recommended
Miss_ Louisa Macdonald for the position she
has just vacated—Airs. Fawcett, the wife of
the blind Postmaster-General of England.
Of Airs. Fawcett it was said: “She has
every qualification for a successful Prime
Minister of England.” Her sister, Airs.
Garrett Anderson, was the first woman to
practise medicine in England. She was
afterwards mayor of her native town.

“E.T.” : Good old Shakesbacon never fails

Under the smile of safety wounds the world.

A.P.: Glad to put it all. right—the Norroy
King of Arms is Sir Henry Farnham Burke, not Sir
Harold Arthur 8., and his wife is the only daughter
of the late H. P. Palmer, of Melbourne.... Mung:
Curses on you for crowding your typewritten lines
together... .Pick: No; the holding runs to “the
thread of the stream”.... Wymac: 33,000 gallons!
Surely that's wrong!... .D.A.T.: The argument is
done to cinders. The Chinese coolie scheme you can
take as having no hope whatever... .J.R. (Melb.):
“I am whirling all my freshened limbs around in
the balmy air.” All right, sister ; don’t let us in-
terrupt... .Sapphire Smith: The point of “The Com-
mon Enemy” was used a couple of weeks ago on
another personage... .Iota: The gag of the blank
face misses by an inch. .. . TI.S.F.: You might sell
it to a London paper—say the Daily Mail. Return-
ing copy.... Miss M. C.: “Her pale yellow hair was
like a superannuated tow-line” would be all right
if there was anything attached to the line... .Ed-
mund C. C.: “Peace” has been worked overtime.
What there is left of her deserves a rest... .Coleraine:
“Night Mail” been done much better... .Yak: It is
not suitable. . . .E. Dath: Glad to hear that Brown is
killed. Saves us a job. .. .Nagrom: How do we
like them ? We hate with a passionate hatred prose
slabs written as verse.... Van Noel: Ditto.... Golly-
wog: Better grow up.. . . Fauntleroy: No. use....
B.W. (Norwood) : Why throw in those irritating jig-
saw bits?.. . .Veritas: That male-goat has happened
before... .D.F.M.: Sorry, but there’s not nearly
enough meat on the bones.... Doe: Why write in
pencil on sheet’s as big as blankets ?... .Elliven:
That ground has been well worked.... Bluebush: No
use for that pompous display of bad English... .L.L.
(Macleod): It has a hint of 'quality in places, but
there is too much echo about it... .11.A.M.: No.
... ..T.B. (North Sydney) : Metrically mad ; and it
ought at least to look as if it might mean some-
( thing. .. .Reginald S.: No use to u 5.... Alfred S.:
Not up....E.D. (Owanyilla) : Rotten;, and get a
pen-name or some more initials. ■ Australia is full
of “E.D.’s,” as Edward Dyson - knows... .M.:
Dreary stuff... .J.H. (Q.) : “The Dream” and “Red
Rose” don't quite do it.... Lotus Lilies: “Iola”
doesn't interest. .. .M.E.M. : Not nearly .. . .A.E.G.:
Too many words to say too little. .. .R.W.G: No
use for the “sad reflections,” so we won’t toll a
“solemn death knell” or beat a “muffled drum”....
J.H.S.: Rather poor attempt. .. .Nemo: It’s as crude
as the song of an ungreased wheelbarrow.... Mag:
What on earth do you mean by “Azure natal dawn
artistically is tinting”? Tinting what? The “lanky
sun-legs” ?... .L.K.: Mutual improvement verse can’t
preach its homily here... ..J.P.G.: Verse not up. ...
Tin: The “Follow, follow” is fine, but “Three
Maidens” doesn’t say enough. . . .A.L.N. : Poets may
be born; but a good deal of honest work goes to the
making of decent verse. ... lone: Bumps out of tune
at the second line. . . .Lois Emile: Put more brain-
sweat into it... .Reginald S.: “Oh, Henry” not our
style... .W.J.C.: We have no use for prose cut into
stove lengths, even when it is peppered> with dots.
....Edward O.: Try a sample in print:—-
In former times Bill used to mend old umbrellas
For a lot of jolly very nice fellows,
Who took Bill and gave him the Prime Minister’s
job,
And then Bill cocked his donkey ears and he turned
out a snob.
Now Bill Hughes called his cobber and said, “Hol-
man, old man,
We will have to pull ourselves together as quick as
we can,
For I fear we will get beat at the next general
election.
Don’t worry, your royal highness, if kicked out we’ll
get invalid pension.”
> .... J.A.M.: Put the plane over it... .F.A.M.: Yarn.,
goes with a heavy step over ancient ground....
PH. (Knoxville): No use H.C.8.: Wouldn't
change places with you for the season's output of
cheese. .. .M.O. (Camberwell): Nothing there....
A.A.:, Don’t believe it C.A.G.C.: Bad prose
Bannerman: Not up FM.B.: You’ve certainly got
the art of verse-making down to a fine point.
Sample:—•
Then to a house they came, ’twas old,
Once lovely, too, shattered now
And blackened by the smoke of fire.
The woman was old. The house all she had.
And only she for its oldness loved it last —
She whose children now were dead
Out there on the field of No Man’s Land.
She waits as the men go past.
Then in through the broken garden gate and
By the trampled hedge she goes.
. ...L.C.R.: Not enough interest. .. .R.C. (Albert
Park): Miles below standard... .Ack-Vic-Ack:
“Home Port” gets very near Keynote: “Flotsam”
just misses G.E.M.: “One Morning Early” goes
thinly... .E.S. (East Melbourne): Poor verse....
W.E.F.: The “Interview” and “Advertisement” miss.
“The Degenerate” is better, but it’s hardly fair to
burlesque a returned soldier like that... .Resurgam:
Feeble little flutter... .Whymsicus: All very slight.
II.R.C. (Napier): Very bad C.8.H.: Not up!
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
K.U.F.: Some of the titles are ingenious,
but it wouldn’t be worth printing the capsized.
map to get them in.... Geo. H.: First said in Lon-
don about 1867 —-unless Grandad was a liar. Per-
haps it belongs to 1837.... H.L.J.: The joke bumps
heavily... .Frank D.: That drawing would have been
declined even during the masked period.... Pencil:
The child is horrible enough, but you score no other
successes Walter C.: It’s a fizzle J.W.G.:
Very weak. .. .A.C.M.: Good work for a beginner.. . .
Colin S.: You wouldn't sell those ideas if you argued
for years H.L.G. : Thoughtful of you to put a
wilderness of margin around your religious hatter.
We’U leave him there if you don’t mind.... ;E.T.:
We’ve decided not to ask the two children and the
policeman to help us earn our sixpence this week. . . .
G.G.: A frivolous poultry journal might appreciate
that jest. But we doubt whether there are any
frivolous poultry journals. Egg-laying competitions
crush the humor out of them... .J.8.G.: Not here. <
... . S.H.: We’re giving that old bird a rest....
M.J.M.: Too many scratches and a joke that creaks,
. ...F.A.: Go ahead and learn. You’ve got some
idea of the thing Grace C.: Rather clumsy
adaptation of an ancient idea.

The genius of the great
Thomas Alva Edison
is once more asserted
If someone told you tliat a great Inventor
had at last PERFECTED sound-reproduc-
tion—had accomplished sound-re-creation —
to whom would your mind instantly turn?
To Edison, of course.
And it is true that sound-re-creation HAS
been made possible by Mr. Edison through
the medium of
The NEW EDISON
This wonderful instrument is as big an
improvement on mere “talking-machines” as
a Strad is on ordinary violins.
Great, world-famed artists have matched
their voices against Mr. Edison’s re-creation
of them —and two hundred thousand music
lovers have expressed their inability to dis-
tinguish the living voice from the Edison
re-creation of it.
No mere “talking-machine” could possibly
sustain such an acid-test.
The NEW EDISON is pre-eminently suited
for music-lovers. You must hear it to realise
how absolutely life-like are its re-creations.
Write at once for fully descriptive printed
matter, post free.

Two Favorites —MISS MURIEL STARR
and DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY
-V.

¥
MISS MURIEL STARR, the clever and popu-
lar actress, a true New Discovery Girt.
(From a May and M. Moore photo.)
Dear Sirs, —I have been using your
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for the
past week, and, although I have
never given a testimonial for any-
thing before in my life, I feel that it
is my duty now to write and tell you
what a splendid remedy I think Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery is.
I had such a nasty little cold, and
it bothered me so much and aifected
my voice when speaking. I never was
so annoyed before, and I could not
seem to get rid of it—sometimes it
was a little better and then much
worse. At last I was told to try Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery, and I did,
and I think it fine. The very first
dose eased my throat and helped my
voice, and now every trace of the cold
is gone. There was no getting better
and then worse again with that cold.
After starting with New Discovery I
simply improved right along and I
want to tell you that I think your
remedy a fine one, and I intend never
to travel again without a bottle in
my grip. Wishing New Discovery
every success.
I am, sincerely yours,
(Sgd.) MURIEL STARR.
STOPS COUGHS,
BANISHES COLDS
Dr, Sliclilon’s New Discovery is Austra-
lia’s favorite Cough and Cold Remedy, and
although it is a discovery of recent years
its fame has spread all over Australia, and
hundreds of women joyfully tell how Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery keeps away
Coughs, Colds, Influenza and Bronchitis
from every member of the household, from
the oldest to the youngest.
Remember, it’s little colds that grow into
big colds, the big colds that may end in
KS.I2X SSSFSAfZS&Z «; r ?
Coughs and Colds will break up a cold if taken at the beginning.
Dr Sheldon’s New Discovery stops the cough and cold, and prevents any serious
complications. It is unequalled for Influenza and Bronchitis, and is invaluable for
Croup and Whooping Cough, for, while it is most powerful in its action, yet it can
be administered to the smallest child with the same safety as to the full-grown adult.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERE in the great gold flower of a
dawn just breaking for ever,
Here in the wan rose-glimmer of the
skies of the deathless Dead,
There is peace and cessation of ill, of the
blind and ceaseless endeavor
To a goal not clearly defined, or to no
goal save bread.
Placid and passionless ever, the symbols of
rest supernal,
Rose-white poppies engird us, in the gar-
dens beyond the sun ;
With immutable calm and quiet, a pulseless
brooding eternal.
The last word of our words is spoken, the
last deed of our doing done.
All, whether dream or desire, men have
striven for, agonised, died for,
Seemed accomplished in Death, as sin-
shriven and naked of passion we came ;
For, sudden, spread over us flame, and we
knew it the dawn men have sighed for-
A fire and a vapor lethean to life with its
sorrow and shame.
And we cried: “Though the sands of silence
have hidden the old gods’ faces
The while we have grieved o’er them fallen,
have they savored delight such as this?
From the haunts of their awful slumbers in
desolate desert places,
Would they murmur as now we murmur,
‘Let be, we have found our bliss’?”
And we said: “We have drunken the wine-
aye, the red bitter draught of Life’s
sorrow.
One by one we have wrestled with years
for no guerdon save not to fall;
We 'have wasted and rotted alive, have
counted Time, morrow by morrow,
For the coming of that which should end
us—behold we have found our all !*’
Yet as otherwhere, still it eludes us —the
hidden, ineffable wonder.
The desire of the moth and the man for
one star still beyond and above
Comes to us in sleep, and we dream of the
lurid low heavens whereunder
Moves Life, with its laughter and storm,
and its sudden sweet lightning of
Love.

J. HOLLOWAY.
The Funny Funeral Writer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STAGGERS when I knew him first was
a tall, lantern-jawed young man who
never smiled outwardly and earned a
good but insufficient living on an evening
paper which, so he complained, insisted on
regarding him as its funeral specialist. For
some reason which was never explained, no
great man could be laid in his tomb without
the assistance of Staggers. Two days after
I got to know him and his pet grievance
against the .omce he told me that he had just
done his 700th funeral in two years. The
way he spoke of his last case made my hair
stand on end; but when I came to read the
obituary notice I could hardly believe that
he hadn’t written it with tears streaming
down his face. Despite his protestations, I
think there must have been a trace of the
undertaker about Staggers.
Staggers had a heart of gold and a failing
for helping people. He helped all sorts of
people, regardless of age or position. He once
helped the Premier of the State (it happened
about 2 a.m. and was very thrilling), and
he possessed a letter of thanks from a con-
demned murderer for whom he had done
something or other. People who wanted his
help, or to whom he had promised help, used
to pursue and fall over him at all hours of
the day or night, and drag him from the arms
of his friends. He would be sighted running
at full speed from someone he had promised
to help and wanted to help, but whom he
wasn’t ready to help. It hurt him horribly
to have to run away from his clients and
change his lodgings so that they wouldn't
haul him out in the middle of the night. But
the best-hearted man must occasionally look
after his own affairs or liis job, so Staggers
occasionally had to run for it, cursing him-
self all the way. It seemed to be his splen-
did ambition to do the worrying for a regi-
ment of complete strangers who were too
tired to help themselves. If you got him into
a corner and tackled him about it, he would
reluctantly admit that he was a fool to do
it; but habit and his golden heart would start
him off again as soon as he escaped. He had
an amazing range of clients, and their faith
in him was touching. If Staggers could have
done half as much for himself as he did for
other neople in the year, he wrnuld have been
too rich to be seen walking.
One day when we were all having a drink
together (we were nearly always all having
a drink together) a speechless, blue-eyed
country lad in ill-fitting clothes was piloted
into the bar by one of the office-boys and
deposited on Staggers’s bosom. The conver-
sation (which was not fit for the ears of
children) at once died a natural death, and
we finished our drinks and went out rever-
ently, leaving Staggers and the boy together.
We knew instinctively that somewhere, at
some time, Staggers must have offered to help
him. The boy’s long trousers looked so recent
that the promise had probably been made to
the boy’s father.
It was two hours before Staggers got back.
He was dejected, and admitted that the boy
was the cause of it. The child had come
straight from the bush to be made into a
journalist by Staggers, who had met his
father once across a post-and-rail fence; and
Staggers sometimes had doubts as to whether
he wrns a journalist himself. Then the boy
had only 15s. to carry him on till he should
be a leader-writer or something worse. The
Helper-General informed the office that, as
far as he could see, the only thing to be done
was to add the child of nature temporarily
to his family, and send him back after a
decent interval.
It was at this precise minute that the wire
arrived from Tasmania acquainting Staggers
of the absurd fact that he had just won
£lO,OOO in the Cup Special. There was a sort
of shocked pause—then the office boiled over,
and a torrent of mostly coatless and hatless
journalists met the upward toiling bush jour-
nalist on the stairs and swept him before
them into the official pub. The subsequent
proceedings were too numerous to be men-
tioned ; but the young bush journalist looked
on with a pleased smile and was ecstatically
speechless. Nobodv had taken the trouble to
explain things to him, and I rather suspect
that he thought journalism was always like
that. The evening closed in a haze of cabs,
one of which contained Staggers and his hon-
orary apprentice, who was taking things as
they came—and they came very fast —with
the calm of utter inexperience.
Next day Staggers wasn’t worried about
anything, least of all about what to do with
the youthful Verdant Green. (That wasn’t
his name, but Verdant Green suited him
much better and he took kindly to it.) He
had a splendid scheme for disposing of Ver-
dant. Now that he had money to play with,
he intended to employ Verdant privately as
a funny funeral writer. Every time he had
a funeral to do he would take Verdant along
and get him to write it up in a cheery way.
He said he calculated to get his money’s
worth and perhaps teach Verdant something
before he went back to the bush.
The scheme worked out wonderfully well.
Staggers bought some dark clothes for his
understudy, and together they did all the
funerals that were worth going to. After
each interment, Staggers would be rewarded
with a priceless account of the proceedings
by Verdant, who had no sense of humor at
all and took his job very seriously. He had
an amazing knack of improvising idiotic
In Memoriam verses and working them into
his graveyard musings. When he asked
Staggers why they weren’t printed in the
paper told him in strict confidence
that the paper intended to issue yearly a
book of obituaries, and that his (Verdant’s)
stuff would have pride of place. He begged
Verdant not to mention the scheme to any-
one, and Verdant promised faithfully not
to do so. However, he reckoned it safe
enough to write home about it. His despatch
was handed round by Staggers, to whom he
had submitted it:
Dear Dad and Mum, —I am getting on grand here
with Mr. Staggers, who takes me to all the funerals.
He does it serious and I do it up humorously for the
Comic Funeral Book of the Year which the paper
is going to print. My wages is £2 a week and
my poetry is much admired by all who see it. Mr.
Staggers says there is nobody else doing anything
so good in town, but he has asked me not to say
anything except to you. I look all right in my
mourning and it is pretty good riding in cabs. I
never cry now when on duty because it used to
annoy Mr. Staggers. Mr. Staggers says the best
thing about funerals is the drink you get after-
wards, but I never have anything but ginger-ale.
Yesterday I had seven ginger-ales in half an hour
and was all blown out. But funerals are not always
as jolly as that. I enclose a copy of the last comie
funeral notice I did. There are some things in it that
are quite right because Mr. Staggers told me them
himself. He says the paper won’t let him put in
the good things he knows about the stiffs, so he
tells them to me. The man this comic is about
used to drink and be in the Legislative Council
before he died.
ALAS! HE’S GONE.
MB. BROWNLING’S FUNERAL TO-DAY!
BARMAIDS IN TEARS!
This afternoon, while the birds were singing in
the trees and all Nature was beautiful, the mortal
remains of that gay old boy Jack Brownling were
lowered to their last resting-place in the presence
of many pals. They did not dry the starting tear
because they hate dryness. No! they would rather
have sung with our bard, who was amongst those
at the graveside—
Dear old Jack has gone for ever,
Gone across the Jordan’s stream,
Though his dear friends will not find him
Still in pubs of him they will dream.
His photograph upon the wall
Is all that’s left to view;
He was a good old M.L.C.
And many barmaids knew.
If he should reach the Golden Shore —■
Of which I have no doubt —-
The angels will sing out to him:
“Swim out, old Jack! Swim out!’’
However, the occasion being a solemn one, the friends
and relatives did not engage in song, but stood round
with their hats off. An old pressman who was present
remarked that it wasn’t like old Jack to lie there
and sav nothing when there were 40 or 50 thirsty
people round him. But, alas! our deaf old friend
will never again lead his friends to the bar, saying
“Well, boys, what’s it to be?” Alas! his voice
is now silent and his Parliamentary salary is no
more. He was always a good friend to pressmen
when he was alive, and he would have been even
better if he had been able to stand it himself. Un-
happily, dear old Jack did not get into politics
until he had been forced to key himself down to
nine whiskies before dinner. His oldest friends used
to say regretfully that the palmy days of his thirst
had been wasted in the house-agent business. He
never got amongst the boys who could appreciate
him until the first flush of his glory had faded. But
old Jack was never a quitter. His cabman used to
call regularly for him at the Nectar, and it was
his proud boast that, if he couldn’t go home by him-
self, he could at least be taken. Most of the bar-
maids knew him well, Horatio, a fellow of infinite
jest, who knew too much to take any draught stuff
and not too much soda in it, vou Little Darling!
Ah well! he is gone now and a lot of the girls round
town will feel is if they had lost a father. No
man could do the honors of a bar better than he,
but look at the practice he had. He leaves a widow
and three daughters—but that is nothing new. His
social engagements in life were so many that he
was always leaving them. When the first sorrow has
faded, and they have forgotten that he is out for
good, they will perhaps think of him and say it is
a pity he is staying out so late. Old Jack’s fortune
was considerable, and it would have been more so
if he hadn’t been such a jolly good pal. The
funeral arrangements were carried out by William
Spade, and William was such a dreary cuss that
anyone could see with one eye that Old Jack had
had nothing to do with the funeral arrangements.
As an old pressman remarked at the graveside: “No
man ever knows his own undertaker.” (P.S. —Mr.
Staggers helped me with all this.)
Staggers had employed and possessed
Verdant Green for three months before Ver-
dant began to show signs of swelled head—-
the result of the unlimited praise Staggers
gave him for his unique cemetery jottings.
First he wanted to know why his “works”
(someone had told him they were “works”)

W orliing' Under a
Continual Strain?
Does a Lame Back Keep You Worn Out All the Time?
Maybe you bave weak kidneys, a trouble
that often follows a cold, a fever or a spell
of worry, overwork or unwise habits. It
shows in constant, dull, throbbing back-
ache, or sharp twinges when stooping,
lifting, getting up or turning in bed, with
headaches, dizzy spells, a tired, nervous
state and irregular kidney action. Don’t
neglect weak kidneys, or you run the
danger of having dropsy, gravel, heart
disease or other complications. The kidneys
are the blood filters, and must work all the
time to keep you in good health. Take
things easier, follow regular habits, and
take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, a
remedy in use the world over and recom-
mended publicly in Sydney week after
week. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
certainly worth a trial.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold
by all chemists and storekeepers at 2/9
per bottle, or post free by Foster-McClellan
Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

Serious Kidney
Trouble.
Sydney Man’s basting Cure.
Mr. James Higgins, 21 Terry Street, Surry Hills, Syd-
ney, says:—“Some time ago I was taken very badly with
kidney trouble. I don’t know how to account for it, unless
several accidents were to blame. I consulted three doctors,
and underwent treatment, and each one failing to do me
good, advised me to go into hospital for an opera Jon. They
said my case was almost hopeless, and that an operation
was my only chance, as one of my kidneys were in a very
diseased state. I took medicines of all sorts, the empty
bottles alone being worth a considerable amount. Every-
thing railed, and I was in such pain and misery that I
did not care if I lived or died. I had severe pains in my
back, giddiness, headaches and scalding urine. I was com-
pletely done up, and scarcely able to lift anything. The
day was appointed for the operation, when a friend asked
me if I had tried Doan’s Backache Kidney Tills. He told me
he knew of a man who was as bad as 1 was and had been
completely cured, and for good, by these pills. I post-
poned the operation, and commenced using Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. A fortnight later I returned to work, and
the men there could not believe ihe change they saw in me
would have ever been possible. There is no doubt it is
wonderful. I am quite cured, and as fit for work as a man
could be.”
Fourteen years later Mr. Higgins says:—“The above
statement is true, every word, and I can now add the
important fact that I am still free of every distressing symp-
tom of kidney trouble. My lasting cure is proof positive
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills will cure serious kidney
complaint.”

were not published in the paper. Staggers
tended him off with the book lie. Then Ver-
dant shocked him by demanding £4 a week.
(Staggers, by this time, had bought a race-
horse and a barmaid out of his sweep win-
dings, and was beginning to see that there
is an end even to £10,000).
“I couldn’t afford it, my boy!” protested
the funeral specialist. “I simply couldn’t
afford it ! Why, as it is”
But isn’t tile office rich enough to pay
me £4 a week?”
Staggers suddenly remembered that the
olrice did not know he had a comic appren-
tice. No!” he said. “The office couldn’t
pay you £4.”
“Well, I can’t get married on £2 a week
these times,” whined Verdant.
Staggers jumped slightly. “Look here!”
ie barked, “don’t you get married while
you re on this job! Now don’t forget that!
lou re not to get married.”
But can t I go to funerals when I’m
Mr. Staggers?”
You 11 go to your own funeral if you <»et
married while you’re on this iob!”
"Why, Mr. Staggers?”
Staggers waved his hands in the air “Oh
/ don t know! Er—the office don’t like the’
juniors to get married.”
“Can’t they do something for me, Mr
staggers l Suppose I was to go to the
Editor and tell him”
Staggers caught him by the lapel of his
„ , wa . n 1 t you to promise me some-

tor hates to be worried about these things

them beer It was Staggers’s policy to pour

fe de i!'’ °, r i w hat6ver it might be. Not till they
ad swallowed a pint each and cooled down

“ the comic funeral writer!” shouted
the-more threadbare undertaker.
Showed me his notes!” screamed the
undertaker with the ruined hat.
“What did you do then?” asked Staggers
in the grave family-physician manner.
"What did I do!” screamed the under-
taker. "I chased him away from the inter-
ment. I wasn’t goin’ ter let him be comical
about me! I wouldn't let no newspaper
print a lot o’ rot about interments 1 had
anything to do with !”
“Quite rightboomed Staggers. “Drink
that and we’ll have another.”
“/ chased him, too!” shouted the thread-
bare undertaker. “We would have made it
very serious for him if we had caught him.
There was tw T o gravediggers and three
mourners as well as myself, but he got
away.”
“lie jumped the fence,” continued the
undertaker with the ruined hat. “One of the
gravediggers aimed his shovel at him, but
missed him.”
“Was the funeral disturbed?” asked Stag-
gers. gravely.
“I never seen an interment so disturbed in
my life,” moaned the threadbare undertaker.
"For five minits or so the deceased was
getrin’ no attention at all.”
"I never ’card about comic funeral-writers
before,” said he of the ruined hat. “When
I asked him what he was writin’, an’ he tole
me, I couldn’t b’lieve it for a minit.”
“He’s made up a song about it,” com-
plained the threadbare colleague. “He had it
all wrote down with th’ name an’ every-
thing.”
“Drink that up and let’s have another,”
remarked Staggers. The glasses were taken
away and refilled.
“Councillor Boggs’s family was very upset
about it!” The threadbare sucked placidly
at his beer, wiped his lips and shook his head.
“They thought perhaps he was th’ bloke
from the Weekly Lunch come ter dig up
that ole trouble about th’ road-metal. You
’eard about that, didn’t you, an’ th’ row in
the council, an’ all?”
“Yes,” said Staggers, the liai*, “I heard
about that.”
“Weil,” said the ruined hat emphatically,
“there wasn’t no truth in it. I wouldn’t ha’
buried ’im if he had done a thing like they
said he did. I can toll you I don’t bury
anybody! I’m particular, I am!”
“Councillor Boggs never did a dirty bit of
work in his life,” moaned the threadbare
one. “He deserved a good interment, an’ he
got a good interment —cxcep’ for this ’ere
comical writer!”
“He won’t do it again!” declared Stag-
gers. “I’m going to send him away to the
country to-night. I can’t have him going
about and interfering with interments. You
will explain the unfortunate affair to Coun-
cillor Boggs’s relatives, won’t you?”
“And we can tell ’em that there won’t be
anything in the paper?” pleaded the thread-
bare undertaker.
“There won’t be a line ! As I told you, the
poor boy is quite mad and doesn’t know what
he is doing. This won’t occur again!”
“It’s a disturbin’ sort of tiling,” said the
ruined-hat undertaker as they rose to go.
“I never experienced anything like it before,
an’ I’ve been conductin’ interments for
twenty-five years.”
“You will apologise to Councillor Boggs’s
family?” requested Staggers at the door.
“We will,” chimed the men of crape, and
shook him warmly by the hand prior to
climbing up on the box-seat of the waiting
mourning-coach.
Verdant Green subsequently broke the
news more or less in the letter he sent on
ahead of him to his parents in the bush:
and Mr. Staggers says that there isn’t much
demand for comic funeral writings and I want more
experience and he’ll speak to the Editor of rhe
ild Dog Banner and try and get me into his office,
ill'. Staggers says that undertakers have a down on
comic funeral writings and I did wrong to tell
them I was making up a poem all about Mr. Boggs,
who was a town councillor and greatly respected by
all. Tell Ned Beavers that I saw Violet vesterday
and”
Staggers doesn’t employ anybody now.
When lie reached the end of his £lO,OOO he
disposed of the supposed racehorse to a
milkman. But he found that he couldn’t sell
the barmaid. Nobody ever sold a barmaid.

SIT down, Slithers,” said the general
manager of that enormously wealthy
firm, Trusts Amalgamated, as, filled
with nervous dread and dire forebodings, I
entered, in obedience to a tap on the bell,
his cosy and sumptuous private office.
“As boy and man, Slithers, you have been
with us about sixteen and a half years, I
think?”
“Yes, sir,” I replied, my legs trembling.
“And we have found you at all times
attentive to your duties, Slithers, even when
tempted by street processions and sounds of
revelry outside the office to be entirely
otherwise.”
“Yes, sir,” I assented, modestly.
“You differ noticeably, Slithers, from the
rest of our employees, most of whom seem to
regard the office as a sort of social club,”
continued the g.m., almost managing to
smile, but restraining himself in time.. “You
appear to be tireless, Slithers. You work all
day. You are an earnest fellow; not one
of those who leave immediately the clock
strikes and forget their work until the next
day. You often lie awake at night, I am
sure v thinking things over.”
“Yes, sir, often,” I answered.
“And only the fact that this office closes
at five o’clock prevents you, Slithers, from
working all nielit as well as all day !”
“Of course, sir, yes,” I stammered.
“You do not stay away from work, on the
pretence that you are ill, in order to go fish-
ing, nor do you steal away for an hour or
two at a time in the morning with a news-
paper or magazine concealed beneath your
waistcoat, as certain other members of our staff
are in the habit of doing. You are very con-
scientious, Slithers. You love work. ' You
are industrious, persevering and efficient;
an ingenuous fellow, unafflicted bv that pre-
cocious pessimism so prevalent * nowadays
among young men who have to work for a
lu ing. You neither drink, smoke nor swear
and when you leave the office —most reluct-
antly—work being over for the day. vou go
straight home. r At least, I hope vou do
Slithers.”
‘‘Yes, sir, always,” I replied, blushingly.
“In short, Slithers,” continued the g.m
“you are the ideal employee, the kind of
employee, if I may say so, that, with the
exception of yourself, we have looked for all
the years that we have been in business. But
in vain, Slithers, always in vain.”
“Thank you very much, sir,” I said
with a pleased smile.
“And though I am the general manager,
Slithers, and receive a thousand a year, while
you are merely one of the slaves,” he con-
tinued affably, “I realise, nevertheless, that
your essential needs are no different from
mine. You would like to dress well, Slithers,
like me. You would like to live where you
could breathe fresh air instead of dust. You
would like to be able to spend a shilling,
sometimes, on an evening’s entertainment,
without having to walk several sections night
and morning all the rest of the week. You
would like, no doubt, to marry and become
the father of a very large family, Slithers.
You would like to- possess a gramophone as
well, and an allotment of land somewhere
for your reclining years, and to bank a little
money now and then. Am I right, Slithers,
in thinking that you would like to do these
things?”
“Yes, sir, quite,” I answered fervently.
“Then you can commence doing them from
next Friday afternoon,” said the g.m. with
another miss-fire or still-born smile, “for
we have decided to advance you, Slithers.
Wishing to prove ourselves your friends, we
have decided to raise your salary to the
minimum prescribed by law for the kind of
work that you are engaged upon.”
There are times when one is only able '.o
control oneself with the very greatest diffi-
culty.
LES ROBINSON.
A Warning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If you must have me at your feet,
And make a sort of mat of me,
I am content; for you are sweet,
Should you require that of me
I’d beard the lion in his lair
If I could find the hours to spare
For bearding lions, let me say,
Means time and care—and missing you ;
Why should I waste full many a day
When I might well be kissing you?
Why should I leave you, may I ask,
Upon a silly, useless task?
So, when exacting you would be,
Remember ( though all latitude,
*^ s as you are fair to me,
I grant) it is my attitude
That, though I am your willing slave,
None but the fair deserve the brave.’
n.s.w.
