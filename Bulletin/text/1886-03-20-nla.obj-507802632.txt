Imperial Federation or Colonial
Federation.
The Bulletin ,
SATURDAY, MARCH 20,1886.
In a passing reference to the sittings of the
Australian Federal Council—so called—the
Pall Mall Gazette remarks—“ If the
future does not rest with Mr. Service
and Colonial Federation, it will, we hope
and believe, be with Mr. Dallby and Im-
perial Federation.” There is a concreteness
of definition in this sentence which stimu-
lates thought. The English writer, observ-
ing from a distance, has not had his
observation distracted by details. To him
all that has been distinguishable above the
horizon have been the actual mountain
peaks. This then, is what it all amounts to.
Colonial Federation or Imperial Federation,
We are not clear that the association of
names with principles is correct, however.
Mr. Service is not, so far as we are aware,
an advocate of Colonial Federation as op-
posed to Imperial Federation; and, if Mr.
Dalley be accepted as a representative of
Imperial Federation, as opposed to Colonial
Federation, so much the worse for the pros-
pects of the former project. There is, of
course, a third possibility, lhat is, no
Federation at all, but a simple perpetuation
of existing conditions. We do not think
that Any reflecting person will be found to
advocate this, or to regard it as a permanent
possibility. The prospect of the British
colonies in Australia repeating the < xperi.
ences of the Spanish colonies in South
America is not an agreeable one. Still, it
may come to pass, as a result of
various cognate influences. Indifference on
the part of the several peoples, coupled
with the trumpery ambitions of the smaller-
souled among local political “ leaders,”
might operate as an effective Conservatism.
But one of these causes is clearly remov-
able The trumpery ambitions of small
men, only great in petty communities, indi-
cate just the sort ol dispositions which could
be playt d upon by the plotters for Imperial
Federation. The paltry creatures who would
resist any plan of Colonial Federation which
would tend to eliminate them from the
front rank of public men and reduce them
to their true level of merely parochial im-
portance, are just of the exact kidney to be
educed by the bribe of some titular distinc-
tion. And one of the most obvious accom-
paniments and consequences of Imperial
Federation would be a broadcast diffusion
of ribbons and stars, and similar baubles.
For Imperial Federation must involve the
assimilation of the lesser to the greater—
the re-modelling of the Democratic struc-
ture of Australian society and institutions
to bring these into harmony with the aristo-
cratic form of the British Constitution.
» f ♦
The object of Imperial Federation neing
to secure intimate union by the medium of
uniformity, the colonies would naturally,
if they consented to surrender the simple
structure of their present Constitutions,
expect all the advantages, real or supposi-
titious, of the aristocratic form. It is quite
conceivable that undir adroit manage-
ment the colonial populations might be
even cajoled and tricked into demanding
e ■ ‘y with the rest of the Empire in this
lv t, aud the ludicrous spectacle might
sented of a mob clamouring to have
*’ ws bestowed in place of C M.G.-ships,
111 • the most prominent humbugs and
■•■■qi itles of the community. It would
be difficult, if there were any adroit-
hes in management, tor astute political
loaders to persuade a sweeping majority of
colonials than anything less than that
in the way of distinctions for pro-
minent Australians—making themselves the
political leaders aforesaid—would be a
slight and an insult to the community at
large. And, indeed, it is not at all clear
that any adequate denial could be opposed
to such arguments. If these colonies are to
be comprised in a Federal Union with the
mother country, there really is no reason
why their populations should be under dis-
advantages or disqualifications which would
THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA.
stamp them as inferior to their brethren in
Great Britain.
♦ * *
Hence, in considering the probabilities of
the future, it must be allowed that the plan
of Imperial Federation has from the start
an advantage over that of Colonial Federa-
tion, inasmuch as the vanity and petty am-
bitions —none the less active because petty—
of influential and wealthy colonists would
he enlisted in favour of the method
which promised the maximum of gra-
tification to their pretensions. And the
Imperial scheme would possess other
advantages. So large an infusion of
immigrants from Great Britain is still
annually distilled inj;o the population, and
so considerable a proportion of that popu-
lation looks back to the old country as its
native land, that an appreciable amount of
sentimental affection has to he reckoned
upon. The native-born Australian and the
colonists of long standing who have come
to recognise that they are Australians in all
respects when the interests of the mother
country and of the colonies may conflict,
furnish the main equipoise for this senti-
mental and quite irrational predilection.
Then, again, the direct social influence of
the British viceroys and their little Courts
is a most important factor. The Governors
appointed by the British-Colonial office are
practically influential foreigners among us;
envoys charged with the duty of throwing
their influence into the sca'e opposed to the
interests of the populations of these colonies
on all subjects and on all occasions involv.
ing a decision as to whether Imperial or
Colonial exigencies or advantage are to pre-
vail.
♦ * ♦
There are abundant indications, even now,
that these envoys have their ins tractions
with express reference to thisvery question.
Tney have been, iu two recent instances,
selected with a degree of care and fore-
thought which was at no previous period
exercised. The good-for-nothing scamps,
brok.mdown diplomatists, and impecuni-
ous aristocrat, who used to be sent out,
very much as families shoot out here their
rubbish of younger eons with whom they
can do nothing at home, have been replaced
by men of a very different mould. It is
clearly no longer considered immaterial
who is sent to occupy the Vice-regal
residences in the principal Australian colo-
nies. In lieu of regarding these posts as
comfortable exile for a ne’er-do-well with
influential friends, or as an opportunity
for this or that friend, relative, or de.
pendent of some noble lord in power to
elude their creditors, leave their estates at
nurse, or simply make a provision for them-
selves by economy, we have picked men,
evidently chosen in view of their aptitude
to execute a particular and definite object.
In Lord Cakington and Sir Henry Loch,
for example, we have the very opposite of
the Marquis of Normanby and Lord Augus-
tus LOFTus. It is diflicult to escape a con-
viction that the mission of these gracious,
intelligent, and adroit viceroys is to; cajole
the populations, and to interest their public
men into subordination of local considera-
tions to those which are essentially British.
• ■ •
On the other hand, Colonial Federation
can look for support from no extraneous
or adventitious influences. Its advocates
have mainly to rely upon the most
difficult to secure of all buttresses—
abstract reasoning. Their very patriotism
is liable to be stigmatised as treason. And
really they could offer no short rebuttal
to such a charge. Theoretically there is no
denying that to advocate anything resem-
bling the dismemberment of the Empire is
treasonable. And a rejoinder—no matter
how cogent—that the apparent evil is a real
and solid good, has ever failed to silence the
voice of authoritative calumny. It was
treason but a few years ago to advocate in
England parliamentary reform, and among
the population of Australia are yet to be
found descendants of martyrs who were
sent hithtr, cooped up—herded with thieves
and murderers, for the felony of loving
their count) y in a fashion which the domi-
nant class felt to be dangerous to the con-
tinuance of the supremacy which they so
grossly abused. The advocates of Colonial
as opposed to Imperial Federation must
be confined to that limited class—men
at once intelligent and disinterested. Dull
men are easily carried away by senti-
ments which carry the prestige of antiquity
and are stamped with the intelligent appro-
bation of authority. Men accessible to the
promptings of self-interest as distinguished
from the interest of the community arc
always open to the arts of corruption; and
that political leaders will sell a country for
empty titles and even for hard cash has been
but too mournfully exemplified by the his-
tory of the intrigues which destroyed the
autonomy of Ireland, and delivered that
unhappy country to be despoiled under the
pretence of union—which is simply another
term for Imperial Federation.
• « «
Nevertheless, the superior advantages
presented by Colonial, as contrasted with
Imperial Federation, appear to us too
obvious and too striking, to fail in securing
a considerable and very eirnest body of
adherents am mg the Australian colonists.
For our own part, we believe that nothing
is calculated to hasten the rupture of
affectionate relations between these colo-
nies and the mother country more certainly
than any scheme of Imperial Federation yet
foreshadowed. And iu like manner it seems


to us that nothing would operate more
favourably to the perpetuation of existing
good feelings than a relaxation of political
relations which cannot long continue on
their present footing. So long as these
colonies remain integral portions of the
British Empire they are liable to disturb-
ance by every convulsion which agitates
the political surface of Europe—troubles
with which, in reality, they have no more
concern than have the people of the United
States. It is not reasonable that on each
occasion that Russia threatens to march on
Constantinople, or moves a brigade in Merv,
Australians should be harassed by anxiety
for the safety of their homesteads and
placed under the necessity of expending
money in preparations to defend their
ports. It is ridiculous that on any occa-
sion when a Parliament’ differing in
its Constitution entirely from our own
representative Chambers plunges, under the
influence|of stock-jobbers, into expeditions
to repress the aspirations of national free-
dom in Egypt, the Soudan, or the Transvaal)
Australians should be dragged into the
trouble without having had the slightest op-
portunity of it. And no scheme
of Imperial Federation which has been fore-
shadowed, or is conceivable, would remove
that objection. The British Government
neither would nor could submit to have its
foreign policy controlled by a few colonial
representatives. Imperial Federation would,
in this respect, merely increase the formal
responsibility of the colonists by securing a
sort of participation in the preliminaries of
a squabble. But Colonial Federation, while
cementing tnese communities into a nation
sufficiently powerful for self-defence—that
is to say, as powerful in regard to
numbers as were the North Ameri-
can colonies when they resisted and ex-
pelled the armies of Great Britain—would
relieve them from participation in the wars
of the old world. It is surely very evident
that a friendship which was all advantage,
as a close relation between mother country
and young offshoot communities would
naturally be, could be better preserved than
a condition of supremacy on the one pant
and dependence on the other, which, while
offering no.additional advantages, would be
burdened, as now, with grievous risks.
* * *
Australians are practical people. The
very essence of their careers is the spirit of
material development and progress. They
are bent, almost without exception, on in-
dustrial progress. Every individual is de-
voted to money-making. What they ap-
preciate most acutely is a constancy of ris-
ing values, expanding industries, and of
territorial reclamations from the wilderness.
Let these be restricted, interrupted, or
arrested : let universal stagnation be
aggravated by interrupted commerce,
general insecurity, and augmented taxation
for defensive purposes; and let these evils
be seen to be due to a connection which
could be done without, and a general im-
patience and inclination to snap bonds so
onerous would supervene. We know of no
Australian loyalty which would be proof
against a universal, commercial, and indus-
trial ruin, clearly attributable to the Im-
perial connection. It would be better to an-
ticipate the event than to await it; and an
Australian Federation en joying an indepen-
dence which had been the free and generous
gift of a mother country—relieved from
participation in quarrels not its own,
strong enough to defend its own shores,
linked in close alliance, offensive and
defensive, with its great parent with re-
spect to all matters which are of common
interest —would be not only England’s best
customer, but her dearest friend. Then, in-
deed, might be witnessed the spectacle at
some future day of Australia, voluntarily,
deliberately, and from sheer affection, send-
ing her contingents to assist the dear old
land in her hour of need, as a son would
rush to the help of a parent in a good cause.
Far different this from being betrayed into
a detestable contest by the interested
treachery of some irresponsible Minister,
who, secure of countenance and support
from the predominant Imperial authority,
risked nothing, although his invasion of the
Constitution of the colony in which he lived,
and the consequences of his interested en-
thusiasm, plunged his Australian com-
patriots into immeasurable calamities.
Favoured and applauded by the Court and
Government of Great Britain, decorated
with a title, and distinguished by the appro-
bation of great statesmen and a powerful
press, representing interests essentially
foreign, be could smile at the complaints of
his fellow-colonists, and sneer at the Aus-
tralian patriot as a rebel to the Crown and
Government—of Great Britain.
Converts to Socialistic Ideas.
Mb. Puff, in “ The Critic,” remarks of characters
upon the stage that “ when they do agree, their
unanimity is wonderful.” The same remarkable
agreement is observable at present among the
actors upon the political stage of New South
Wales. The blast of laughter—expressive about
equally of derision and indignation—which
puffed out poor Sir John Robertson s proposal
to coax pastoral lessees to sunmit to an augmen-
tation of rentals on condition of a deferred re-
coupment of an hundredfold by receiving the
value of improvements at the termination of
their leases, seems to have extinguished the
whole policy of exempting land from taxation.
Sir John’s own Treasurer (Mr. Burns Included a
land tax among his heterogeneous jumble of
half-measures for raising revenues. It was quite
understood that a land tax was among the
bases of agreement arranged for the Jen*
ninqs-Kobbbtson Coalition, and although the
members of the present Jennings Cabinet
did not appear when addressing their con-
stituents on seeking re-election, to know
what policy had brought them into association,
not one of them but gave some intimation of his
readiness to concur in taxing land values. Again
it Is quite an open secret that in Sir Henry
Palrkes’ policy, a land.tax has a foremost place.
■ « •
This unanimity is indeed wonderful, when one
looks back. It Is the very first occasion that in a
modern community propositions to place burdens
upon real estate have not been denounced in
every “respectable ” quarter as spoliation, confis-
cation, and rascality—as anarchical, socialistic,
communistic, revolutionary, and even as an Irre-
ligious flying in the face of Providence. Colonists
who can remember the intensity of the struggle
and the bitter violence of Conservative sourrlllity
flung upon the advocates of the measure, when
the progressive land-tax was introduced and
carried In Victoria, will be able to appreciate the
contrast. There is no gainsaying the old conten-
tion that meesures of this nature are essentially
socialistic and communistic, and that they are
comprised among the conceptions which have
been denounced as anarchical. But yesterday, as
it were, any such proposition was met almost de-
risively. The opponents of the system of political
economy to which land and property taxation
pertain were confident and overbearing. They
laughed at the advocates of such projects as
visionaries, scouted them as demagogues and
impostors, and insulted them as impotent. They
relied upon “the moral sense of the community ”
to detach them from such notions and to flood
their consciences with shame, the moment they
heard the magic formula, “ The Rights of Pro-
perty.” But to-day that jargon is no longer a
phrase to conjure by. To the diffusion during the
last few years of the lucid teachings of Henry
George and other apostles cf the revived prin-
ciples of equal justice, this astounding revolution
in the prevailing modes of thought may be mainly
attributed. It is half a revolution. Andtheothe r
half will inevitably follow. Now a revolution
which progresses and is accomplished piecemeal is
precisely what is meant by constitutional progress.
* + *
By conversions, such as the present attitude of
the public, and of public men in‘New South Wales
Indicates, all that is good in the Socialist and Com-
munist theories could he adopted without a single
spasm of convulsion. We have long perceived
and taught that in these systems there is much
that is good—aye, not only good but necessary and
inevitable. It is encouraging, therefore, to be
able to record so large a progress as is marked by
universal consent to land taxation in New South
Wales, and equally encouraging and surprising to
observe the S.M. Herald giving its imprimatur to
such a sentence as ths following which appears in
its review of the February magazines on the 10th
inst. :
“ Mr. Walter Besant, like all thoughtful men
of this generation, has evidently felt to the very
core of his conscience the data of the Socialists.”
True, the S.M. Herald hastens to qualify its
pregnant admission by appending the remark
“ which of course is a very different thing from
believing in their proposed remedies.” The ad-
mission is, however, a sensational one, proceeding
from such a quarter. When it is considered that
the S.M Hesald has scarcely ceased to denounce
and abuse “ the data of the Socialists,” its reluc-
tance to admit that the physician who dlagnozed
the disease of society is better qualified to ore-
scribe remedies for that disease than practitioners
who had obstir.rtely and arrogantly, refused to
believe in its existence, and had rudely insulted
the demonstrators as quacks and vagabonds, is
merely an exemplification of the ordinary weak-
ness of Inferior natures.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Vicious Syatam.
In the course of the paper on “ Benefit Building
Societies,” read by Mr. S. Teece, president of the
Insurance Institute of N.S.W., to the members of
that body, Mr. Teece referred to “the colossal
land companies and syndicates which, like a huge
devil-fish, are spreading their feelers over the
colony, inflating the value of land, and gulling the
unreflecting citizen.” We consider that if Mr
Teece’s deliverance had begun and ended with
that sentence it would still have been a valuable
utterance. Such land companies and syndicates
are a curse to the country. Not only do they
tempt the working classes, by the pretenea of
“easy” terms, to give for slices of land
prices (ea-fold what can be obtained for the
same in larger areas, which is a swindle, tut
they are responsible for the creation of insanitary
conditions which the subsequent expenditure of
millions will be required to remove. They are
like all corporations, without conscience. They
cut up lands into slices so minute that each dwell-
ing has a cesspit within a few yards of its back
windows, and whole tracts are under their
auspices packed with buildings so closely that
healthy conditions of existence are out of the
question. The Legislature is grossly to blame for
permitting such minuteness of subdivision, and
its i emissness is only accounted for by the circum
stance that a large proportion of its members are
also interested in these companies and syndicates.
How the new suburbs which daily are forced into
existence are ultimately to be drained and
rendered habitable, is a point never con-
sidered. They sell their land, induce work-
ing men to hypothecate their earnings for
a series of years to provide them with their
profits, and they wash their hands of consequences.
One of these consequences is that just at the time
when, in England, the State has found itself com-
pelled to undertake the demolition of slums in the
metropolis, here our leadiag citizens are busily
engaged in creating the slumj of the future. Mr.
G.H. Reid has alone among our legislators done
anything- to mitigate the evil. What is required
is a Bill on the line of the one which he managed
to get passed fixing a minimum width for streets
and lanes, to similarly fix a minimum area for sub-
divisions In the vicinity of towns and cities.

The Martyr Moor house.
Bishop Moohhouse, yyho has just left Mel-
bourne for Manchester, is probably, for a parson,
about as good as they make ’em. He is a clever
man, and liberal—for a priest—which is an im-
portant qualification. And there are tokens that
when duly Inducted to the House of Lords, his
always prudent and guarded coquetting with
heterodoxy will cease altogether. The Bishop
Moohhouse, of the Irrigation versus Prayer-for-
Raln episode, will merge in the Lord Bishop of
Manchester, just as the Dr. Temple, who wrote.
“ The Childhood of the World,” in the essays and
reviews which scandalised the orthodox a
score of years ago, is quite unrecognisable
in his Lordship the Bishop of London. Of
course, when one says that a man is liberal
—for a priest, or heterodox—for a bishop, one
doesn’t mean anything particularly striking in the
way of liberalism or heterodoxy. Colenso was
the only downright heterodox bishop on record,
and if, in lieu of persecuting him, the orthodox
had intrigued to get him a good, fat prelacy, with
a seat in the Lords, it is likely enough that he
might have repented, and talked of his essays on
the Pentateuch as a youthful folly. But, to return
to Dr. Moohhouse; he offered a charming
apologia pro vita sud, in his farewell address. He
quitted Victoria, not because the mental strain of
colonial work was too much for him~heaven
forbid! that would cut two ways. No, it was the
physical exposure. Our readers would, perhaps,
fancy that we were poking fun at them and calum-
niating the Bishop were we merely to summar-
ise the physical strain which dismayed Dr. Moor-
house by jotting it down as three wettings in
thunder-plumps, one windstorm flinging boughs
of trees about his buggy, a lot of jolting, and
finally having to eat selectors’ fare. We will,
therefore, quote Dr. Moobhousb’s own words:—
“‘ Physical strain?’ you may ask; ‘what are you
talking about?’ Well, ladies and gentlemen, you
are not likely to understand it, because you have
not experienced it; but I may tell you that in the
short tour I have just completed I began with
three tremendous storms, that being in an open
buggy I got wet to the skin, and then I had to
encounter a hurricane among the lofty forest
trees, with the boughs crashing down around me,
any one of which, if it struck me, would have
killed me on the spot. The latter was peril, not
hardship, and I do not think I ever cared for peril.
But there was this hardship aggravated by
unavoidable hard living and unavoidable hard
shaking. (Laughter.) Ladies and gentlemen, when
I say this I am not charging anyone with neglect.
The people of this diocese, and especially the
people in the country, have given me hospitality
in the most generous way. (Applause.) But as
one advances in years, getting wetting to the skin
brings on twinges of rheumatism and the like ;
and eating good wholesome food which is not well
cooked is not conducive to health when the diges-
tion is delicate. (Laughter and applause.)”
Bishop Moohhouse seems to us to argue like a
bushman. “ Why should I expose myself to re-
peated drenchings and bush cookery, just to look
after a lot of confounded sheep,"when I am offered
a snug billet in town, with higher wages and a nice
social position?” Only the good bishop is too deli-
cate to refer to the wages question, or to the social
promotion. It is the heavier mental strain he is
running after, which is remarkable self-sacrifice
in a person who is so reluctant to con-
tinue to subject himself to the physical
strain. We shall never hear Dr. Moohhouse s
name mentioned, hereafter, without thinking
of St. Paul -by way of contrast. St. Paul does
not appear to have had a delicate digestion, nor a
particular Inaptitude for supporting physical
strain. He probably got drenched to the skin
when shipwrecked at Cyprus, and as against Dr*
Moohhouse’s repeated dienchings. Jolting buggy*
storm-driven branches, and hard fare, Paul had
to record, and Bishop Moohhouse would be jus-
tified in recording, his opening sentence as almost
offensively personal.
“Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a
fool)! am more; in labours more abundant, in
stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent,
in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I
forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with
rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered ship-
wreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils
of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in
perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in
perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in
perils among false brethren; la weariness and
painfulnees, in watchings often. In hunger and
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
Beside those things that are without, that which
cometh upon me daily, the care of all the
churches If I must needs glory, £
will glory of the things which concern mine
infirmities.”
(Possible this is St. Paul’s manner of conveying
that his “ digestion was delicate.”)
“In Damascus the governor under Aretas, the
king, kept the city of the Damascenes with a
garrison, desirous to apprehend me : And
through a window in a basket was I let down by
the wall, and escaped his hands.”
These outrages neither of the Governors—the
Marquis of Normanby and Sir Henry
Loch— with whom Bishop Moohhouse had
to do, would, we conceive, have ventured upon.
But, of course, all this is beside the question.
The good Bishop defined his motives for abandon-
ing the Victorian to accept the Manchesterian See,
so as to prevent the chance of misconception. He
believed that he would “ be able to work for a
longer period in the Church of God if he changed
the place of his labours.” This, it will be seen, is
quite a Pauline line of reasoning, being, in fact,
probably identical with the method of ratiocina-
tion which impelled the Saint to leave Damascus.
But we venture, with all respect, to doubt
whether Dr. Moohhouse, in his case, has regarded
all the circumstances. He has not, we fear,
weighed naturally the probable influence upon
longevity of a prelatioal cuisine in England, acting
upon “ digestion which is delicate.”

Mai thus and Vanderbilt
The S.M. Herald has so servile a reverence for
accepted theories, and the writer who contributes
under the style of “Nova Cambria” is sommh
responsible for the Herald’s methods, that it is
unusual to observe the germ of a half-thought,
apparently effecting complete acquiescence in the
system of Malthus, in a paper by that gentleman.
VaNDiiHuiLT, it is alleged by “Nova Cambria,”
by organizing the railways of the United States,
cheapened transit, and consequently oheanen«*
food in the Eastern States. Pened

Now the population theory of Malthus Is the one
grand arch upon which the whole justification to!
Inequality of human conditions is built. Mankind
tends to i - crease faster than the means of subsist
ence, says Malthus, and consequently the weakest
go the wall, and the struggle for existence must
continue to the end of time. The redundant ponu.
must be kept down somehow, says the rev
gentleman, and unless the poor will be thoughtful
enough to do without matrimony and illicit con
nections of a fruitful kind, there must be wars
and starvations, and slums, and deadly miseiv
right along. In short, as the poor are so mall/
nantly obdurate that they will not leave to th«
rich the monopoly of sexual enjoyments as
an addition to their other monopolies, earth
must be a hell to the last day. This is
really too bad, considerlng.frhowlilmmense a
proportion of manklnd-and chiefly the poor
who, as Lord Tennyson sang, “in the lump are

We would recommend the latter gentleman to
give a little attention to Henry George's
attempted refutation of Malthus’ entire argu-
ment. For it is evident that even the virtues of
the god-like Vanderbilt must be impotent to
arrest the doom of humanity if Malthus be cor
rect in his main contention. If population, under
all conceivable conditions compatible with general
human happiness, tends to increase, it matters
not a jot whether the productiveness of the earth
be increasing, nor in what ratio. For it is clear that
sooner or later, a time will arrive when-in default
of wars, starvation and miseries-there won’t be
standing room on the earth for all the people! A
paradox; a paradox; a most amusing paradox I
-A
Obscenity in the Churches.
The Rev. Joseph Barrier, of Sydney, has taken
it upon himself to denounce theatres on account
chiefly of the “indecent expressions” used there,
and the “ shock to moral sensibilities ” likely to be
felt by good people who attend them. It is about
time that parsons gave up this line of abuse
Does the Rev. Joseph never bewail the “indecent
expressions ” which he is ordered to read to mixed
congregations from his pulpit or desk ? On Sun-
day, the Uth inst., the second evening lesson of
the Anglican lectionary comprised the 7th chapter
of the Ist Corinthians. We listened to that lesson,
falteringly read by a too conscious parson, and
dare to say that no more “ indecent expressions ”
have been used on the Sydney stage as long as we
have known it than are contained in that chapter-
nor did ever in our theatre-going experience a
mixed audience receive a greater “ moral shook to
their sensibilities” than did the listeners to that
incomprehensible and unsavory chapter. It was
positively painful to see that congregation
Young men and girls strove to appear pre-occul
pled, but only succeeded In showing that they
deeply felt Ihe Insult to their modesty; old men and
women stared straight before them with a fixedness
that betrayed their thoughts; and children listened
intently to something that was to them new,
and only occzslonally understandable. That the
church should permit such passages to be read is
a marvel, that it should order their use is an in-
delible disgrace. The hackneyed clerical argu.
mont to all this would be “ to the pure all things
are pure.” If this is of force when used for the
benefit of the pulpit it will be equally powerful
when applied to the stage. But wo dispute its
applicability. Let any of the parsons who read
this chapter on Sunday night use similar phrases
when amusing the guests at the next tea party he
attends, and he will find that the room has at least
one door, by means of which either he or his
hearers will make a speedy exit—unless, indeed,
they prefer to pitch him out of the window. The
Church requires more radical measures of reform
than the Stage. Time was when Shakespeare’s
plays, as produced on the stage, contained some
very highly spiced passages, which in those coarser
days were not repugnant to the tenor of social
life, but with the advance of thought and morality
these plays have been expurgated and adapted to
the age so that they can now bo listened to by
persons the most modest and sensitive. The Bible,
on the contrary, has not been so revised, and the
constquence is that church audiences, which are
supposed to contain the most modest ornaments
of womanhood, ara continually shocked by having
such chapters as this 7th Corinthians, rung in to
their Indignant and disgusted ears. And, again, the
most lewd of the plays of a former age have been
laid aside by the mandate of an advancing moral-
ity: the most repulsive (to a mixed audience)
chapters of the Bible are, on the contrary, still
placed among the lessons to be publicly read.
Reform your lectionary, Mr. Joseph Barnieh,
before you again dare to condemn a calling of
whose vices you know nothing except by hearsay.
See that all that is ordered to be read to your con-
gregation is pure and fit to be publicly listened to
by modest men and women, before you venture
to anathematise evils existing chiefly in your own
envious imagination. For ourselves we could
ask the most modest and virtuous ladies in
Australia to go to any of the Sydney theatres, and
be certain that no word uttered on the stage will
make the m wish they were elsewhere, but if we
go with them to church, we are never sure that
they nuv not hear verses which will make them
wish that the earth would open to hide their
trepidation and shame. You may read through
every play put upon the stage during the last
year, Mr. Barnieb, and you will not find anything
so shocking to a promiscuous audience as the
on« chapter we cite. And this is only one out of
a number. For ourselves, we will take care that
in future we will find out what the lessons are
like before we face the pulpit music—when such
homilies as that of last Sunday are to be pro-
duced, we will cautiously remain with the unre-
generate outside. Examine your conscience on
tt i i point, reverend sir, and then sit up and let us
kuoiv by m early post exactly how you feel.

will preclude Its extensive adoption for general

cated by his attitude is also said to have affected

and town deck, will still be surrounded with an
occasional halo of beaming eloquence, for Mr. F.
Gibbes, M L A, for Newtown, has, it is rumoured,
consented to give the Minister the “ mother of a

Mrs. Stephens, the suspected murderess of
poor Old Plum, the Wangaratta farmer, claims to
be a descendant of Sir John Moore, who was
" buried darkly at dead of night ” on the battie-
flrld of Corunna. The instinct of slaughter seems
to have run in the family. We wonder what Sir
John would think of his descendant if ho could
know of her games ? His troubles, we suppose. If
instead of being his descendant, she had been his
contemporary, and a camp-follower, she would
probably hive dugup bijbody, stolen the “martial
cloak” that his soldiers folded “around him,”—and
thus another good poem would have had no legs to

eventually sank to be Lord Mayor and M.P., there

to send them to gaol—all in fun. Sir Andrew

about aldermen (who start life with.fourpence), no
one can accuse ’em of delicacy of feeling.
It is refreshing to learn that Mr. Boehm’s
model for the Sydney statue of the Queen has
been “ approved of by the Earl of Rosebery and
Sir Saul Samuel.” The approval of these two
sapient art critics ought to be all-suifloient for us.
Evidently the statue will deal gently with the
Royal wrinkles and add several to the Royal
stature. By the bye, a truthful representation of
her Majesty’s figure would scarcely impress the
most loyal of subjects. Very few, comparatively,
of those loyal subjects have ever seen their
Sovereign Lady in a perpendicular position. Very
few, in fact, have seen her at all—but no matter.
Well, seated in a carriage, the Queen appe irs to
be a lady of average height, but when she stands
up that illusion is dispelled. The spectator is

" A queen has no legs.”
A novelty in electioneering was intro-
duced by Mr. John Woods, of Coiac (Vie), pro-
prietor of the local Herald. In offering himself
to the electors, John, to whom advertising comes
cheaply, after setting forth his policy and promises,
calls a dtnd man from the solitudes of the ceme-
tery to write an ad. for him“ The shade of W.
J. O’Hoa epeaketh; Liberal electors, those of jou
who remember me with gratitude, vote for my
best friend and supporter, John Woods, the true
liberal. Remember the heavy losses ho sustained
through lighting your battles He sever asked
you for a penny towards those expenses; send him
to occupy my seat. He will be true to you; he
was true to me, and followed my remains to the
grave. Farewell.” Comment on this is needless.
The man who would not hesitate to use the dead
would surely agitate the living. John may get in
next time.
From Mr. Fronde’s book “Oceana”:—
“ Among the friends who had come with us from
Auckland was an English gentleman. Colonel
Blank. At some town where we stopped late one
nigbt, two ladies had been put into the railway
carriage with us. We were going to bed and paid
no attention to them. The berth under Colonel
Blank happened to be vacant. To one of these
new arrivals, without his being aware of it, this
berth was assigned as a sleeping place. Tne lady
gathered herself in and the same leather curtain
fell over them both. In the morning, the colonel
feeling about for his underclothes, dropped
his drawers by accident over t e uJo of
the bed. From below he saw thrust a small,
dainty, and nerfectly white hand, with a diamond
ring and a delicate lace frill round the wrist. It
was holding up the article In question, and a brisk,
ringing voice said : ‘ Guess this belongs to you.’ ”
The London correspondent of the Fbbe-
mans Journal (Dublin) says this of the opening
of Parliament:—“ Her Majesty looked more in-
significant and dumpy than ever. Her face bears
an Indescribable expression of misery and trouble.
Her Imperiousness has grown more observable.
Lord Salisbury had a taste of his royal mistress’s
quality in this respect. After she had taken her
place on the throne, Lord Salisbury beside her, in
his faded peer's robes, with the sword of State in
his right hand—looking for all the world like a bent
pilgrim with his staff—the noble lord took the
liberty of looking round the house. In doing
this he partly turned his back on the Queen, who,
having motioned him to resume his position
facing her, without effect, rapped her fan sharply
on her royal knuckles, and brought the Prime
Minister to attention with as much rapidity as if
a pin had been stuck in him. Nothing could be
more striking than the resemblance borne by the
Prince of Wales in his royal robes to Henry v III.”
There is auxarithmetioal quarrel going on

financial responsibilities of that part of Queens-
land which la looking for Separation. In the
course of the quhrrel high words are heard now
and again. This is unbrotherly“ We know that
Mr. Coote’s statements on any subject do not
carry any weight in Brisbane. He has been en-
gaged as a “ free lance ” so long that he has lost all
sense of moral responsibility for his statements.
If they serve his party ho is content. ’ But we re-
member Mr. Coote turning up the obverse side of
the medal some six or seven years ago. He was
in the witness-box, about some case, in the
Supreme Court, in Brisbane, and having described
himself as a “journalist” he declined to let him-
self be addressed as a “pressman.” The Court
asked where the difference in meaning lay, when
the dignified witness explained that a journalist
wrote what in his opinion was right, but that a
pressman was a hireling who wrote to order.
Before Bishop Moorhouseleft for England,

Some bishops’ professional aliases must be rather
inconvenient. George H. North Queensland, for
Instance, has a longish name to sign when he gives
a receipt for the diocesan “screw.” Samuel
Ballarat and W. T. T Brisbane ought to be crisp,
businesslike divines if they act up to their titles.
On the other band, Sydney Rlverlns must be a
sentimental bard. No matter how practical his
turn of mind In the early curate days, we main-
tain that a Sydney Riverina would necessarily
absorb large quantities of dreamy sentiment into
his system It is a name for which a long-haired,
emaciated poet would; willingly swop ten years
of his life; a name to be whispered in the moon-
light, to be bestowed on a Family Herald
romance, to be rolled softly under the tongue of
one of George Darrell’s dramatic heroines. It is
a languorous, velvety, soul-Inspiring name, and we
sincerely hope the good bishop is doing full justice
to it.
“ William Beach, the champion sculler,
accompanied by Mr J. Deeble, is to leave for the
old country on the 37th inst.” We don’t know what
they will do in the old country towards making
some alteration in the oratorical style of William,
but we should like to see him come back “ quite a
gentleman,” as Hanlan was so fond of terming
‘ Mr. Beach,” with sly malice, at the conclusion
of that orator’s most desolate efforts. We don’t
expect much enthusiasm will be got up in Eng-
land, unless Indeed William is challenged and
beaten by Perkins, whose career out here was of
such a triumphant nature. Perhaps Largan will
have a turn at Beach also. There was more fun
in him, anyhow, than in all the other scullers put
together. He never went out on the water to
taae his feet for a row, but some calamity hap-
pened him. He generally turned over. But no
matter how his backers swore, Largan was always
in the best of humour. Ween he rowed Pearce
on the Parramatta River, and bis boat broke
shortly after the start, Lsrgan, with a grin on him
from ear to ear, was deep in all-fours at Gascoigne’s
long before his antagonist had reached the goal of
victory.
As “Ranger of Windsor Home Park ”
Prince Christian—husband of the Princess Helena

tramps—the British Empire. We were once a
“ Ranger ’’—belonged to the 88th Regiment. For
this we got 4d. a day with an unlimited allowance
of cat-o-nine-tails thrown in when we got too
cheeky or went off to look for another job. Be-
sides these perquisites, a musket bullet was pre-
sented to us one night in the trenches by another
Ranger in the employment of Czar Nicholas, and
the year after, one of Nana Sahib's m?n took such
a fancy to us as to leave the top of his lance under
our shoulder blade. The Russians and Sepoys of
those days were the most hospitable people you’d
find in a day’s walk—dropped in upon you without
any ceremony and brought all their frlends-many
of whom it was necessary to detain—just to see
what was inside ’em. Oar reward for all this?
Sixpence a day for 15 months with the promise of
a deferred pension of 4d. per diem for the balance
of life remaining to us after 00. Ten years more

That aggressive freethinker, Joseph Symes,
went last week to “ spread the cause ” at Woodend,
Victoria. The locals gathered in force, and Joseph
was treated worse than a parliamentary candidate.
He had hardly started tne first round on super-
stition before an egg attached itself to bis person
with the pertinacity peculiar to hen-fruit. It was
an aged egg, a back number, dating as far into the
past as 1850. The attack was followed up with
bluestone and execration. Thinking discretion
the better part of valour, the long apostate and a
supporter sought the seclusion of a back room
and waited in darkness till they thought the foe
had decamped. Then they sallied forth. But the
enemy was about and spotted the revilers of re-
vealed religion Hoots and yells signalised the
discovery, and the sceptics had to pick up their
leather and travel for it, hotly pursued by the
push. The police station was their .haven of nope,
but they were refused admission to the domicile of
the protectors of the sweet calm of Woodond. Only
the missus and a cat were at home, and they be-
longed to the opposition, so once more Joseph and*
his solitary bodyguard had to face the crowd.
Stale eggs and harder metal began to come in
again with promptness and accuracy. But Mr.
Symes did not care about officiating as Aunt Sally
to an excited mob any longer than was absolutely
necessary, so clutching a three-legged bush-stool
which happened to be handy, be invited his friend
to come on and waded in. He laid out four or five
defenders of the faith befere his club weat to pieces.
Then a parley was called, and it is said that for
£lO the gentlemen of Woodend agreed to throw
up the leud. Ten minutes were allowed to pro-
duce the sum, and all repaired to a pub.; the trio
were permitted to go in and scrape up the lucre.
They took half an hour over a meal, then slipped
out at the back into a.buggy, and away, followed
for a quarter of a mile by a hooting and discon-
solate mob. Now, Jos. can tell you without a
moment of thought which is the wooden end of
the Woodend locals. He is going to try them again
shortly, however.
This is the “Vagabond’s” style now:—
“ The other day I bad occasion to write a slight
historical sketch of Victoria. My then secretary
spent some hours at the Public Library making
notes from the authorities.” “My then secretary I”
A flood of recollections overwhelms us. Yean
ago—twelve years ago-we occasionally saw in
Melbourne the “ secretary ” of another literary
light. It was nothing to him to spend hours in the
Library. Why, he lived there! At least, he did in
the day-time. Where he lived at night is more
than we dare trust ourselves to imagine. He
seemed to us to be a man who did not fritter his
time or his brains away on a lot of subjects but
kept steadily to one, Anyhow, every time we
saw him he was seated in the last and
darkest alcove on the left-hand side as you go in—
the furthest off from the Librarian. And he was
always asleep. We don’t know, what class of works
that alcove contained, but we believe they were
of an abstruse description. Perhaps that was
why he was asleep. We began to like him
after we had been in a few times and found
him in thp same place and in the same state
on each occasion. He. seemed to have grown
there, or to have come In the first morning the
Library was opened and never to have gone out
after. But we knew better. We noticed on look-
ing at him two or three mornings running that he
had different kinds of grass in his hair eaoh time,
and once he bad enough little twigs in it to make a
bird’s nest. From these signs we concluded that,
like bold Allan-a-Dale, “ the high vault of heaven,
with its crescent so pale,” was the only kind of
roof he cared to sleep under. That secretary man
is dead now, we suppose. Making notes in all pro-
bability killed him. By and bye, when the Vag’s
“ then secretary ” dies, his once-master will, if ne
has left in bim any sense of gratitude, put a little
headstone over the remains of bis coadjutor. The
epitaph need only be—
Born

Mr. Crooks—what a happy name for the
man, by the way—who succeeded so splendidly in
smashing the Commercial Bank of *oUth Aus-
tralia, was another pious and God-fearing person.
He was regarded as a rook of trust. The widow
and the orphan, the little shopkeeper and the
artisan, placed their small savings in the bank of
which he was manager, with the same faith as
though they had “ laid them up in heaven. He

She was black, but ’twas no matter—she wsg

She was round where she should not be—and
where curved she should be—flat;
But her charms were all apparent, to one white
man's eye revealed,
So he stole her fnm hia wigwam, and ii camp
kept her concealed;
And they lived “away up-country,” till of imps

And of hard work now not guilty, country papers

NOTHING adds so much to personal appear-
ance as a bright, clear complexion and a soft
skin. With these, the plainest features become
attractive; without them the handsomest are but
coldly Impressive.
The prevalent use of powders and pigments,
proves the value placed upon the complexion.
Remembering this, and knowing the immensa
amount of Injury that is caused by the use of
powders, we have much pleasure In drawing atten-
tion to a preparation which may be used without
the slightest hesitation, and which will produce
the effect desired. Its action Is based upon purely
physiological effect, and the blonde and brunette
alike may use it. Powders are no longer neces-
sary to build up pretentions to a beautiful com-
plexion, but the face assumes that clear, trans-
parent, healthy look—that natural look—free from
every disfigurement which cause ladies so much
concern.
This preparation is now within the reach of all,
and by sending a stamped addressed envelope to
Doctor Von GEisnkHO, Box 18, Post Office, Hay-
market, Sydney, any lady will receive free,
through the post, the formula and full instruc-
tions.
TO THE MEMBERS OFT3E AUSTRALIAN
MUTUAL PROVIDENT SOCIETY.
Ladies and gentlemen,—l respectfully solicit you
Votes and Interest as a Director of your Society,
of which I am and have been a member for 26 years.
I think it due to you to speak with no uncertain
voice with respect to the action of the Board In
establishing a branch in Bngland for the taking of
English risks.
I believe the step to be unwise, and that the
opinion of the members should have been obtained
prior to adopting such a momentous change in the
.policy of the society. •
I deem this the more incumbent on the directors
as the decision was NOT the unanimous vote of the
Board, but ONLY CARRIED by the votes of a
majority of the directors.

Prince Karageorgivios, the Russian no-
minee to the throne of Servla, has decided to expel
the present Milan, whose head uneasily wears the
crown. We wonder if Prince K.’s name was
attached to the document in one piece, or, like the
tales in the Evening News, continued in his next.
Let us warble a little lay to the air of Kara, &c.
Ho. Karafreorgivios,
Ho, Servia’s Prince, Milan,
Pray stop these foolish tricks
And think—of the Soudan;
The great Powers cannot stop
Your noisy argument,
But wo on you may drop
With Dailey’s Contingent,
And blow you high as kites,
Each Servian bold and Russ.;
Adjusting claims of rights
Is just the game for us.
We have not cares enough,
Nor business of our own,
That’s why It comes so rough,
This letting folks alone;
Our rulers (some) want fight,
Friend Karageorgivios,
You cable out; it’s right.
The cosc will be—well, “ nix.”
We’ll pay the little bill,
’Twill square the Russian bear,
For foeman, then, we will
Have little need to care;
And when the trouble’s o’er
Come out—lt’s «o long since
Our Jingoes, on the shore.
Have gazed upon a Prince.
People who arrange for meetings, presen-
tations, picnics, or political addresses should
adhere religiously to the time and place of rendez-
vous, the manner of their speaking, and other
details as furnished to the Press. Breaches of
faith In this regard lead occasionally to awkward
errors. The Narandera Argus Is the latest
victim of misplaced confidence. A presentation
was to be made to a local gentleman, but owing to
an accident the arrangements miscarried, and the
presentation was not made, but the Argus report
was In type, and the paper came out with a full
account of the proceedings which would have
taken place. But then similar things have hap-
pened in Sydney. Last week, for instance, an
evening paper gave an interesting account of the
swearing in of the Jennings-Kobertson Coalition,
“just before we went to press.” As luck would
have It, the members of that embryo Cabinet swore
off instead of swearing in. How the boss of the
enterprising evening paper swore Is not stated.
“Ah, ha!” we heard the editor of the
Barcoo Rot remark on bis last visit to Sydney as
he stood before the bar of the Vitriol and Blue-
stone, “Ah, ha! We wilfhave rum please, Miss. Two
rums.” She handed them over with a supercilious
smile, and enquired, “ Where’s your friend ?”
"My friend. Ah, I see,—my mistake, I have none,
merely used the editorial ‘ we.’ Force of habit,
you see; but we will drink the two rums,” he
added, reflectively. And for a quarter of an hour
afterwards he was trying to persuade an incredu-
lous damsel that a tintag and “a copy of our last
issue” was legal tender in Sydney for two rums.
At the conclusion of the argument he left very
speedily. Left on bis ear in fact.


The Melbourne correspondent of a Vic-
torian paper says that the body of a certain mili-
tary officer who recently died out here was taken
to England “ packed in an old piano-case as general
cargo." II that be so, what was it they " planted ’
in the general cemetery ? It was bad enough to
ship him away as “general cargo,” but—in a piano
easel This is surely a gross Interference with the
divine prerogative, and If the souls of mortals go
into purgatory there is no precedent for the
corpse being shot into a piano-case, out of which
has perhaps but recently escaped the instrument
for more earthly torture than purgatory ever
afforded the doomed souls of the various late
lamented who have gone there.
The system is strengthened and the nerves toned

When “No Mercy” was produced on

Kw and more completely unanimous than a

drama is chock full of choice sentiment, and the
moral Philosophy is of so high an order that it Is
Soar “the Waggerbone” must have stood on a
tat?-POSt or a gin-case when writing it. The
moral goodness of a man who would not strike
atmther because he was his wife's brother, was a
mMterly and refined piece of spread-eagleism.
Some persons are not so particular in their con-
duct to their mother-in-law. But the Yag.

The Sydney Alhambra still magnetises
the public, who are drawn to its portals as is the

about this simile, but it is as expressive as wa l can

Keenan and Moynham are a humorous duet,
a sweet thing in duplicate, though the expressive-
ness of the former is more marked than that of
any other burnt cork artist in the show. Sam is
mostly all expression, and when he spreads him-
self for a smile there is a degree of sublimity on
his frontispiece which rivals in its intensity the
shadowy depths of a dim and despondent volcano.
Warner, in his speci Uties, takes his share of the
pie, and, as Willy has sense enough to play right
up to the gallery boys, their applause is always
hearty and unstinted, and from their responses to
his efforts comes the liberal applause of the house.

Lance Lenton—who, by the way, will
shortly transfer his allegiance to the Federals-haa
prepared a parody on " Called Back." Its title is
"All Black.” and, after hypercritically viewing
Conway’s dramatic story, we are compelled to
admit that Lenton’s is the more humorous. The
cene opens in a Woolloomooloo hash-house, and
ends in Darlingburst Gaol, with the necessary
intervais of snow, sorrow, and suffering. The
hero of the play dies drunk and departs to eternity
carrying three-quarters of his secret with him. In
this particular he comes clear ahead of Conway’s
hero, who only carries half his secret into the land
of shadows. Those who have seen " Called Back ”
will appreciate the burlesque, and those who have
not should do so. The snow-storm is most realis-
tic. The Herald circulation is increasing. List
night a section of a leading article fell on Bent’s
head and Horace has not b?en the same man since.

At the new Oddfellows’ Hall, Harry Mon-
tague Is running a snowstorm in black, under the
title of the Vanity Fair Minstrels. We noticed in
the combination the faces of several old friends
and favourites, noticeably Misses Eolland and
Francis, who warbled their musical tributes to
“ Little bright eyes,” and “ Mother’s grave,” in
the sweetly pathetic style which usually obtains
in minstrel halls. How strange it seems that the
maternal relative comes in for all the "tat” at
the hands of ballad mongers. Why can’t they let
up on the female racket and give the old man a
chance? A skipping rope dance, by Miss Wilson,
was a peculiarly graceful performance, though,
to a certain extent, lacking in usefulness.
It is not absolutely necessary to skip and dance
at the same time. W© had been at Foley’s
In the morning, and watched young Dooley per-
forming a similar feat. He is in training to tight
black Jackson. We don’t know who Miss Wilson
is training to fight. Flint's chair song went well,
but he left out the comic Dutch song in the second
part; he was evidently at variance with the musi-
cians, Couldn’t stand sing ieg the music of “ Lan-
nigan’s ball,” while the orchestral undertakers
were playing the “Daad March.’’ There is, of
course, the usual “ side-splitting farce,” which
runs with the smoothness of a tram-car and the
hilarity of a funeral procession. Side-splitting
farces are usually mournful. Give us tragedy
when we want a real genuine laugh.

‘ Three Hats Slightly Mixed” promote
hilarity at the Sydney Opera House, and the piece

crowded as a land-sale lunch-tent.

Miss Genevieve Ward informed a reporter
of the Alta California (a San Francisco paper)
that she has played in " Forget-me-not ” one thou-
sand and five times, that Mr. Williamson is the
most liberal manager she ever dealt witn, and that
he gives Mr. Gordon, his scenic artist, a salary of
fiOOOdoi. a year. Mr. Gordon certainly deserves it.
He has painted scenes—some for the Pantomime
in the Melbourne Royal, for instance—which were
real pictures, and deserved a better fate than to be
painted out again to make room for new ones. The
rapturous reporter, speaking of Miss Wasd’s per-
sonal appearance, says “ Miss Ward is a very
beautiful and graceful woman. Her face was
bright with animation, and a glance at the per-
fectly chiselled features was sufficient to tell why
Miss Ward ranks as one of the most beautiful
women who have graced the histrionic profession.”
Hump I Brown sherry, we suppose. It not the
gushing scribe must have interviewed Miss Ward
by means of a telephone, and have got his descrip-
tion of her charms from an ancient editionlof the
Theatrical Dictionary. We have seen Miss Ward
with the naked eye, and failed to notice that she
was of an uaearthly beauty. Her style, In fact, is
massive and early Norman, not graceful and
Graeian. But, perhaps, we would have been even
more ridiculous than the alta California man
'i w@ foad been in his place.

five acts and 16 tableaux, who neatly burned him.
self, and quite “ busted ” up the show, some years
ago in Sydney, appears to have definitely
quitted the salvation Harmy in England, and re-
turned for good and all to the stage. For, behold,
Walter figures in the following ad. (two inches
L double column) in the New York Mirror:-" Mr.
Walter Reynolds’ tour of ‘A Mother’s Sin In
Great Britain,” “A Mother’s Sin” is evidently
Walter’s Harmy address cast in a dramatic form,
and sure to be abounding in Incident, From what
we can gather, Walter Reynolds' opinion of the
“army” must be almost Identical with that so
frequently and poetically expressed of them by a
certain Sydney “captain.” “It's no good, old
pard,” he’ll say. “ I’ve sold the ‘ Medical Wonder
for three years, and been a * Lightning Calculator’
for JO, but struggle all you will with ’em, you
can t as much as best ’em out of a Sunday’s din-
ner. If it hadn’t have been for tafeing the other
captains down at poker on pay day, why, blame
me, if I don’t believe I’d have been a captain
still.”
“Nadjezda” is the title of a new sensa-
tional drama, written by Maurice Barrymore, and
produced at the London Haymarket early in
January last. Among other curious and interest-
ing characters there is an English aristocrat of a
type well known on the stage, who falls in with a
loud American female, who is supposed to re-
present a transatlantic fashionable lady. The
wooing that goes on between these two is rather
remarkable judging by the following passage:—
“Are your intentions honourable or dishonour-
able ?” asks the lady. The Englishman parries this
very natural query with another —“ Am Ito
understand, madam, that I have the choice ?” And
yet the piece is an utter failure. Bring it along
here, Maurice.”

Tahiti is a magnificent place for dramatic
companies to visit. Washington Norton writes us
that he has recently made this discovery. When
ho visited the Island he was only allowed to give
three entertainments—not enough to pay his ex.s
in going there, before the Director of the Interior
prevented farther performances, apparently
for fear that the company would take away from
the community all the coin in circulation. Wash.

It is stated on what should be reliable
authority that Miss Ellen Terry threw up her part
of Olivia in the “ Vicar of Wakefield,” in which
Irving was playing in London, not on account of
Miss Linden’s burlesque of the part at another
theatre, but on account of severe indisposition.
Further, it is alleged that Miss Terry and Miss
Linden are bosom friends, and have always been
tbat way. Can it be then—no, of course, not—
they would never think of manufacturing a yarn
like that just for the purpose of getting a free ad.

Joseph Maas, the well-known English
tenor, died a few weeks back. Mr. Maas first
came prominently before the public as Babil, in
! the original production of “ Babil and Bijon,” at

and as a singer ranked second only to Edward
Lloyd among modern English tenors. We don't
include Sims Reeves unaer that category. The
evergreen Sims was warbling in opera before
, Maas saw the light.

Father Campion, of Belfast (Vic.), went

The rival candidates were Messrs. J. J. Madden
and Joseph Jones, and Father C. told his flockthat
supporters of the former were “standing on rot-
ten planks with hell yawning beneath them.” The
contest, in fact, rested between Hell and Jones,
and it is a melancholy reflection for the hon.

of Belfast threw him over for Hell by a large

A South Australian paper is mildly ram-
pant because an exceedingly holy man, who

There has heen a lot of discussion at vari-
ous times as to the exact interpretation which
should be placed uoon the word “gentleman.”
Mrs. Byrne has settled the point for ever. It ap-
pears two larrikins stole an accorneon from her
and were caught in the act When she was asked
in Court for some particulars of how she captured
them, she said, “They behaved like perfect gentle-
men, your worship, and did not attempt to run
away.” The “perfect gentlemen” got a “three
stretch ” each immediately.
We print this because the obliging man
who sends it has the audacity to say it is new and
true:—"At a meeting of the Ballarat (Yio.) City
Council, the question of beautifying Lake Wen-
douree was bef ore the sittings. After some sug-
gestions on the part of different members, one of
the councillors, a gentleman who had just returned
from Europe, said: 4 Why not procure a gondola ?
‘By the powers, yesl’ exclaimed a Grecian mem-
ber well known In the calico trade; ‘but why not
have a pair, so they can breed ?’ Begorral”
Some of the sentences passed by the legal
meteors who dispense blind and deaf justice from
the southern benches don’t seem to dovetail.
Last week two men—one for stealing a hat worth
half a guinea and the other for annexing a police-
man’s waddy when the zealous guardian was con-
varsin’ wid a cook-got three days’ each. Next
morning a small boy of rueful aspect was awarded
three days for stealing an eighteen penny pigeon.
The youth now knows that It is foolish to prig a
pigeon—that It is more reasonable to serve 72
hours for a turkey.
Hamilton (Vic.) is discovered to be the
Australian Sanatorium. The Hamilton Spectator
gives the reason;—“ We have authority for stating
that cases of consumption . . receive the
greatest benefit, and, indeed, get quite cured by a
residence here . . Perhaps the easiest . . .
explanation is that the minute germ of Bacillus,
which is always present in the affected lungs, can-
not exist in this district.” Fancy people living
where even Bacilli starve! We don’t want to be
told in the next sentence that the Hamilton rate-
payers are all Scotch.
Politeness seems to be rapidly establishing:
as a feature in the conduct of Sydney suburban
meetings. At one meeting a councillor is
threatened to be re-christened by having a glass
of water thrown over at another one is
charged in plain English with being of the same
persuasion as Ananias of glorious memory, while
at a recent meeting of the Leichhardt Council, an
alderman likened another to a “ dunghill,” after
which “ smart rejoinder ” says an evening paper,
“the matter was allowed to drop.” And thus
slowly, but surely, does our civilisation progress.
The tip-oat club down our lane is con-
siderably “narked” over receiving no answer to
its request that Lord Carington be patron of the
institution. The committee can t understand it, as
it was expressly stated In the letter that no sub-
scription to the funds was expected or desired,
since the very great strain upon his lordship’s
purse by charities, &0., had been such as to pre-
clude the noble lord further endowing with uls
wealth institutions that were not of a purely
benevolent character “First Tip for life,’’con

A telegram to the Sydney dailies on the
12th announced that a saloon passenger nam-d
Margaret Stephenson, while proceeding by the
steamer Glanworth from Charters Towers to Mel-
bourne, threw herself(overboard and was drowned
seven miles west of Breaksea spit. James Coutts.
a seaman, jumped overboard to her assistance but
she never' rose again. The gallant tar was pre-
sented with £l4 by the passengers for his conduct.
He has, according to the telegram. “ mved life on
two occasions in a similar manner.” Well.it the
two previous ones were saved In a similar manner
to this it seems to us probable their perfect resus-
citation will not be accomplished till the sobbing
sea gives up its silent dead.
They ran a man out of the Melbourne
Equity Court the other day because he wanted to
smoke. Jt was between acts, so to speak, counsel
were behind with the next case, and there was
absolutely nothing doing. The man considered
this a favourable moment for bringing a long felt
want under Ju ge Moiesworth's notice so he pro
duced half a cigar, and e qnired, “ Mv lord, cav I
light no ? ’ F v that modest request he was igno-
miniouslv chocked. So matter, tne incident
clearly shows that men are beginning to rebel
against antiquated restrictions on their harmless
little pleasures. The time may come when every
church wdl have to be provided with ‘smoking
pews," and when It does—when it does-dear
friends, the gospel will commence to bum m real

Burglary has attained the rark of a
science A Melbourne ponce sergeant stated in
court the other dav that burglars carry a lantern
with red, green, and white lights. This lantern is
held by one confederate while the others are
‘ cracking the crib.” It Is used in exactly the
same way as lanterns on the railways. If the con-
federate turns on the white light everything is
right; if the green, caution Is to be exercised ; if
the red “ stand not on the order of your going
hut run like bl«z 8 ” Is the meaning convt-yed.
Anybody who wiehes can now turn burglar. We
have had serious thoughts of doing so ourselves
before now, bqt we were a 1 ways restrained hy the
fe*r that we might some night wake a policeman
too suddenly, and perhaps render him a mental
cripple for life.
When Sir Alfred Stephen dies he will go
to Singapore, where they have just made the
whipping of women illegal. The law that has
been In operation there these many years bask
empowered a" Judge to order the “ oat ” to be laid
on to the bare backs of females as well as of
males for various offences. The discussion on the
repeal of the measure in the Counoil-chamber was
sometimes warm. Votes were equally divided at
second reading, and the third reading was carried
by a majority of two . only. Mr. Shelford
characterised the measure as “ a silly, sentimental,
and ridiculous Bill;” while Mr. Addis expressed
the opinion that discretionary power should be
left with the justices,” as there might be women
in the gaol at sometime or another who as fully
deserved whipping as some men.”
A Northern constable was charged with
stealing two files and four chisels the other day.
The magistrates exnressed a mild surprise at the
character of the theft. Pshaw I There is nothing
to he surprised at in it. That constable evidently
had an eye to eventualities. It he found catching
thieves did not pay his, plan was clearly to turn
thief himself, so with that view he was beginning
to quietly accumulate a stock of tools In trade.
The report says that he was a young constable.
The information was unnecessary. No old con-
stable would commit such a theft—and be caught I
There is a way known to some In the force of
combining both professions. If it were not for
this where would the terraces of houses come
from which we hear so much about ? [Why from
thrift and teetotaliam, of course. We allow no
scandal about the force In this paper,— Ed. B.]
He was a young, struggling practitioner,
aud took almost any case that was brought to him.
So it came to pass that he had to attend to a
married couple who suffered from the painful,
though not incurable, complaint commonly called
"jumps.” Looking in on his rounds he found
them both prostrated with a severe attack, and
bending kindly over the husband he asked him
how he felt. “ Ah, I’m coming round a bit,”
gurgled the sufferer; “ but, bust me, «he got’em
real bad, and serve her darned well rightl” At
this moment the female patient commenced to
gather three-cornered Insects from off the leech’s
nose and aimed an ioeffeot al blow at the kanga-
roo that was sitting oa nerciest ‘Why do yin
say it serves her right ? ” asked the doctor, gently
withdrawing his propose a and wiping it on the
bedclothes “ B e iuae she ain’t got no right to
have ’em the same time I have ’em I ”
Joseph Palmer Rabbibt’s threat to shoot a
reporter has got out as far as Adelong, and the
editor of the local Argus awakes and pertinently
asks: “ Where are we ? Oan we be under the iron
hand of the Russian Czar, or the censorship of the
French President ? Surely we are only dreaming
that we are living ia free, sunny N.S.W.” He then
becomes retrospective, goes down to the days of
his childhood, and asks if the old institution that
was then his terror is to be re-establisned. “ That
oppressive, infamous c->urt known as the Star
Chamber,” he says “ was abolished, we believe, in
1641; is it possible that the member for Gunnedah
would like to see a similar institution re-estab-
lished within the walls of Parliament ? ’ The way
the Argus writes makes us reflect that, advantage-
ous to the people as the abolition of the Star
Chamber was to many ©f them, the abolition of
tho three-star chamber would be much more so.
“ Physical Wreck! ” exclaims a humorist,
“ You can hardly take the ruby colour out of your
nose in the way you suggest. The man who
charged you 35 dollars for bleaching your nose
and then went away, leaving your inflamed pro-
boscis inserted in a large plaster-oast, was no
gentleman, and I would ce wllllog to have you
tell him so on your own responsibility. 1 cannot
hold out any gllUeringlpromises to you, P. Wreck,
as regards the ultimate fading of your nose. It
may fade, but you will, no doubt, fade with it. It
wilt not grow pale in time for you to marry again.
My advice, for which I charge nothing, simply
appropriating the tare a virgin stamps you en-
closed, is to so live that when you come to die you
will nut be ashamed to let St Peter smell your
breath Farewell, Physical Wreoa. Let your nose
be a lighthouse to the growing youth of our land.
Do not put it under a bushel, but let it be trimmed
and burning. Do not hide it behind the thick
glass toottomof a baer mug, but keep it out in
the open air, where the school phildren can look
with a khudder on the band painted holocaust
which God gave you to smell with.”

supply of oysters and stout and some other people,
we went bv Invitation of the employees of Messrs,
bummerfleld and Company, the well-known Pitt-
street tailors and clothiers, to enjoy ah outing on
the occasion ot a complimentary picnic which was
being tendered to Mr. Predric Jones, the head of
the vast business. On the run do wn to Tennyson,
we were introduced to one or two social gentle-
men, and subsequently Introduced ourselves to a
man who was employed opening ovsters. Bnte*-
ing into discussion with him upon the uncertainty
of earthly things, we kept bis attehtlon fixed on
the for ward part of the boat while ever and a-ion
we snatched a juicy oyster which he bad just
peeled and promptly put it in a place of safety
A. hamper of p rter was standing invitingly open
We removed a bottle, and in the sylvan soli-
tude of the smoke stack transferred its con-

rowing a cigar and a match from Mr. Collins,
the latest imported exponent of Freethought,
we strode to the upper deck, and whispered in the
ear of the captain ot the Telephone, “ Porter and
” ‘ Eh I what d' y’say?” he gasped, as the
wheel spun round like the traveller of a veloci-
pede, “Port her, what’s up?’’ “What are you
twisting that little wheel about for?” we asked.
He fixed his eye on us with a long comprehensive
stare; then slowly worked the wheel straight
again. Still eyeing us as If we were some kind of
new curiosity, he observed, emphatically, “ Well,
I m; I say, mister, didn’t you say • Port—her?’ ’’
“Certainly; and I was about to observe, when you
commenced monkeying with that little wheel,
that porter and oysters are not bad things at sea.”
“ Oh! you was, was you, just going to make that
startling and original observation, eh? Well, now,
I know that, and passengers are requested not to

about your fl. Work y ur originaliry off on

banks of the historical Parramatta, and ahead of
us was—lunch. Thinking upon all these beauties
of nature we mused. Thus. We were ow at a
clothier's holiday. These smart young mm and
smiling maids us were ail employ- d ia dressing
their fellow creatures, providing them with the
outward garb of civilisation And yet, we thought,
how much happier was man in an earner state
ot ignorance when ciothlug was unknown and
tailors unnecessary. How much more comfort-
able, too, no trousers baggy at the knees, no coat
shiny at the seams aad shoulders, n >—in fact, no-
thing Use that We said “how much?" and the
answer came promptly, “ Dm t know,’’ aud we
don’t Perhaps more, perhaps less. But we still
mused as we ploughed the giant billows of the
heaving Parramatta, and then it dawned on us
that the tutors craft was the olsest mi'er the
sun tbe first trade ever practised, and taught, too,
ny the same Being who placed that unfortunate
couple on the small selection at the junction of
the Euphrates and Igris. Then the spirit of
p i sy glided from below, and placed In our naads
a scrou. There was a sudden darkness, a convul-
sive throb, volumes of smoke were being emitted
from the funnel, the whistle shrieked, and all was
still. We were waiting for the man to open the
bridge. Once more the screw revolved, the boat
aped on, and we opened the scroll, half an enve*
lope, and read
Adam and Eve by Nature bleat
Knew not in clothes they should be drest, J
Tib God, of leaves, made garments line,
The nr st of tailors-the Divine.
No masher’s suit, no crinolette,
Mad mis-shaped Nature's form as yet;
No tight-drawn waist, no chimney hat
For head had yet formed habitat.
Oh, God-drest pair, how blest to be
Clothed but in leaves from flower and tree.
No cloth to weave for clothing rare,
No tailors’ bills to cross you there.
&.nd as we read the ooat sped onward, our
musings being suddenly interrupted by the run-
ning out of the gang-plank, and we stepped
ashore. We were at the picnic. Proceeding to
the pavilion we satisfied ourselves that It was
there still, and returning to the beach watched the
aquatic pastimes of the youth with a delighted
eye. The steamer had scarcely moored along-
side the wharf ere the sports of the day com-
menced with the pair-oared racing. The crews
started in divisions of three or four each and
ploughed the billows with a determination-worthy
of a champion’s efforts. The manner of proceed-
ing was most interesting to those who, like our-
selves, have never seen a boat-race. It ditfoia
very much from a horse-race, in that the puller
has his back to the object poluc and approaches it
without seeing where he is going. In the case ot
a pair of oarsmen pulling, a small boy sits in the
hind part of the boat and directs its motions with
a pair of reins. The boy has an excellent oppor-
tunity for studying the beauties of the harbour,
as it is at his sweet will the boat must go, and on
Thursday, in more than one case, the coxswain
took the oarsmen by a very circuitous route from
post to finish. After several heats had been pulled
off with no less nor more than the usual amount
ot fauit-finding inseparable from athletic competi-
tions the gong sounded and a general dart was made
for the pavilion. We did not run, but our move-
ments were marked by considerable activity, as
we made our way to the pavilion, when on the
snow-white cloth was spread the dishes and dain-
ties necessary and requisite to feed 300 hundred
tailors, clothiers, and their friends. Espying a
vacant seat In close proximity to a dissected hen,
we sat and argued the point with the deceased
bird. She, or it, was speedily imbued with bur
opinions, and agreed finally with us in every par-
ticular. The guest of the day busied himself la
waiting upon nis employes, who, in turn, estab-
lished themselves as waiters upon each other/ and
thus it fell out that we did not drink the toasts
subsequently proposed In the Insipid fluid of which
tea is made. No, gentlemen, gold-top, Chateau la
Rose, and Guinness, waited at our elbow, and
each toast was faithfully and loyally absorbed by
us in one or other of the divine nectars above
more particularly specified. Various toasts were
proposed, all directly associated with the business
of the day. “The Guest” (Mr. P. Jones) was
toasted, with “ The Firm, ’ and Mr. H. W. Chap-
man, in a forcible and complimentary speech,
alluded to the growth of the business of
Summerfleld and Co. as an almost marvellous
development. The speaker very sensibly pointed
out that trousers and other garments were a
necessity under the existing laws, and while
these laws remained In force people must be sup-
plied with dry goods. Mr. Jones, on assuming the
management of the business of Summerfleld and
Co., at once grasped this fact, and set himself to
work to make the business known throughout the
colonies. As a business man, he was fully aware
of the necessity for advertising, and striking out a
new line, he shortly placed Summerfleld a songs in
the front rank of readable notices of articles for
sale. Some of these poems were metrical and
melodious, and, while setting forth the fact that
Summerfleld's three-guinea suits were all wool a
perfect fit and thoroughly shrunk, still educated
the colonial reader in the principles of poetical
musmgs What could be more practical and yet
poetical than this:—
“ Dearest love, do you remember
When you beard the wish revealed ?
Yes, we’ll marry in September,
Buy your pants of Summerfleld.”
In this, as the audience would perceive, there wag
a blending of fact and fancy of sentiment and
suitability which could not fall to attract the
attention of all readers. To the firm, which was
practically embodied in the person of Mr. Jones,
much credit was due tor the rapid advance into
favour which their business had made, and be
trusted that poetry and pants would long be inti-
mately associated. After some highly eulogistic
remarks, Mr. Chapman sat down on his hat, which
we had just placed on the seat, to prevent anyone
taking his place while he was speaking. In his
excitement to get up again, he split our glass of
claret, sod we drank success to Summerfleld’s
suits in an empty glass. Mr. Fredric Jones, in
responding for the firm, spoke in an exceedingly
practical manner. After complimenting the vari
ous employees, he expressed the pride he felt in
being present that day to receive at their bands
this pleasant token of esteem. “ But ladies and
gentlemen,” said Mr. Jones (and the words should
be seared into the heart of every young man),
“ some people have said I have been 11 lucky,’ that
it is good luok for me to own the business now in
which, five tears ago, I was, as each of you, an
employee Gentleman, there ig no such thing as
luck; there is nothing which may Influence
a man’s career except that which he carries in his
own breast. Diligence, energy, the will and power
to make the moat of every chance, these, gentle-
men. are the component parts of luck, and without
toem it is little use expecting the co-operation of
Fortune la building up a man’s prosperity If you
each acid every one of you hut apply yourselves
to work, be frugal and industrious, saving care-
fully, and investing judiciously, you may, in
course of time stand in a position similar to my
own.” The hearty appl use and vigorous driok-
ing of champagne which followed proved the
sentiments of the speaker fouud an echo in the
breasts of his auoitory. There were various
toas'S proposed, " The Employees,” “ The Branch
Managers” (at Dubbo, Llthgew, Newcastle, and
Wagga, where sub-establishments are being con-
ducted), “The Visitors,” and “The Ladies.” At
the conclusion of the speech-making the band
played some animating music, and in a few
seconds the flying feet of the holiday makers were
chasing the giddy banana peel across the room.
Other sports were Indulged in, as racing, rowing,
jumping, &c. A pair-oared race for girls attracted
four crews, and proved the most Interesting item
ot the day. On getting the word go they sped off
in an energetic though inartistic manner. The
stroke and bow oars were not labouring In unison,
and the various coxswains did not appear alto-

was that the flag-boat had to chase the competi-

Farmers in Victoria are crying out for
labourers. The labourer's life ii usually not a
happy one there; 15s. a week is average pay at
the busiest season. He has to rise at 4 o'clock in
the morning, go a mile or two ia search of horses,
and then start work. His breakfast is “salt
horse,” and potatoes, generally boiled the day
before. Dinner is much the same. He knocks otf
at dark, but must cut chaff or roll logs till bed-
time. One man says that it is only a few of the
most degraded swipers that can be got to follow
the plough among the “ cockles ” in Victoria.

One of the surprises of the Victorian

supported by the Roman Cataolics. hoteLkeepers,

tion Ministry Politics are to be as
Mr. Matthew Arnold understands G od Power

Pretty writing, isn’t it ? The whole ot the article
is an attack on Mr. Deaki's who atone time was
the white-headed boy of the Age. The reason of
all this seems to be that now the Liberal and Con-
servative parties have Joined together, the Age is
without an ocoupalion—except such as Gutman
ascribed to Carlyle, “ to lie down in the Pathway
of human progress and bellow.’ If it support the
Government, why then so does the Argus, as
well expect these two to agree as to expect a goat
to go in harness with a wombat. The age wants
to boss the Government—that or nothing. Its
motto Is, to paraphrase the expression ot Louis
XIV., Vital c’esT David Syrne.

Graham Berry is to be presented, with a
Service o f plate before he leaves Victoria to ta»e
up hjs Agent-Generalship. A service of plate 1
Weu, be deserves it. Epveii the Coutservativcs say
|o. This shows how the times phange and so on.
We remember when they would have liked to pre-
|hnt him with another kind of plate— a colfln-
plate. He la not, however, going to get hia picture
hung up in the National Gallery just yet, though
Jimmy Service is Bitting for hia portrait, which la
to be suspended among the other masterpieces
there. A member of Parliament suggested, at the
meeting held in connection with the Berry Testi-
monial, that Parliament should pay for the por-
traits of eminent politicians and have them hung
on the walls of the Melbourne Walhalla. The
suggestion was rec lived with a shudder at first,
and then—when the lull grotesquerie of the idea
dawned upon them—with howls of derisive ap-
plause. Just think I There are 86 members in the
Victorian Legislative Assembly. This would mean
86 portraits, or else—well, or else one-fourth of
the members would carry on the government of
the country, half would be in the hospital, and the
remainder In the dead-hmse. The survivors In
the House wnuld, of course, be the eminent politi-
cians. Mr. Bent would take a high rank among
these. So would Patterson, of Uastlemaine. If
little Mirams were a member then, he would be m
the deadhouse-quiet for toe first time in his life.
And probably the proposer of the suggestion
would occupy a place adjacent to him.
Whenever a Parliamentary election is
coming on in Victoria, the edict goes forth from
the Melbourne Age office that all Roman Catholics
are to be boycotted, and David Syme’s organ did
not fail to resort to such disreputable tactics at
the general election just over. In some cases the
Age hits straignt out from the shoulder; in others,
it hits below the belt. This is how it recently hit
Councillor William.levers in the Carlton election:
—“ln Carlton, Cnesar and Pompey are so very
much alike that we confess ourselves unable to
adjudicate between them. But we suppose it Is
between Mr. Gardiner and Mr. levers, the latter of
whom is a Catholic .” The hint was quietly taken
by the bigots with the result that the poll stood
Gardiner, 1565; levers. 968 the defeated candidate
properly complained that the election had not
been decided on the relative merits of the two men.
Everyone has heard of Jack Gardiner. By way
of a joke, the Carlton footballers whom Jack
captained put him up to oppose the Hon.
Jas. Munro, who had ‘ ratted ’’ from the Ltberai
party. The footballer heat the clever politician.
Ever since he has bee a ia Parliament he has been
the laughing stock of the House. His two most
brilliant performances have been in advocating
the abolition of the barmaids, and getting the
Carlton quarry boles filled up. He has been
elected tnree times by the Orange, Rechabite,
Wesleyan, and Salvation Army vote. His late
opponent. Cr. leveis, is a young man who has
worked his way up the ladder, is shrewd and well-
read, has built up a large business by his own
energy, and is one of the smartest members of the
Melbourne City Council. But he Is a Roman
Catholic, and therein lies his sole offence His
f ather was one of the few earnest democrats in Vic-
toria who helped to place Liberalism in ascendancy,
and young Mr levers has always been identified
with,the progressive party. Mr John Gardiner
was unknown when the levers were working on
behalf of the popular cause, and Mr. Gardiner
alongside Mr. levers is a mere pigmy. But this
did not concern the Age, which pretends to be the
organ of Democracy. levers was a Liberal in
politics, but a Papist in religion. Gardiner was a
nonentity in pclitics, but a Protestant in religion.
This was why the Age opposed levers and sup-
ported the incapable Gardiner. If this policy is
pursued it will have the effect (as it already has
had) of excluding from public life some of the
best and most useful men in the Southern colony.
Sir Henniker Heaton has made his open-
ing speech in the House of Commons, and—oh, ye
godsl—the member for Canterbury has been—sat
upon! In this wise. Mr. Chamberlain had asked
the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
whether the British Government was prepared to
send a tleet to prevent the possibility of an attack
upon the Turkish seaboard. Sir Henniker inter-
jected: “Before the right hon. gentleman answers
that question I wish to ask him the following on
thesisame subject—viz , whether his attention has
been called to the following stated ut made to-
day by the correspondent of the Times— ‘ Lord
Salisbury’s sensible action is most opportune tor
the peace of Europe and kindly to Greece herself.
(Cheers and dissent.) Telegrams have come in all
the afternoon and evening testifying to the joy ’
The Speaker: ‘ The hon. gentleman is only reading
extracts from a newspaper. The reading of such
extracts is not asking a question of a Minister.
(Hear, hear).” And so was the extinguisher
placed upon one who was to have shone la the
British Commons as an example of Australian
intelligence. Mr Chamberlain must have felt
keenly gratified by the snub which the bounding
kangaroo received, and it Is just possible the
Under-Secretary was not less pleased. But they
should have let Sir Henniker have a little longer
run. In three months’ time, if unchecked, he
would have been running England on brand new
firms. Six months later his place would be leader
of the lords temporal, and in one year Henniker
would be King of England, Emperor of India,
Czar of Newfoundland, and Mayor of Woolloo-
mooloo. But now he 's sat upon. Letuswaii:
Oh, Heaton, we had hoped, indeed, to see
One name “emblazoned on the scroll of fame,”
To hear one voice from o’er the rolling sea
By nations greeted with a glad acclaim;
Thine was the voice, and thine the name we
viewer
In Fancy, as the name and voice of one
Whose pathway was with laurel wreaths be-
str6w@d
Of whom we wildly would exclaim, “Well done.”
But so it may not be, and thus we weep,
The bitter tears adown our pale cheeks run,
All jealoua of your wit and wisdom deep
(Bee yet to flash it s lightnings had begun).
They bid you shut your head, and go to sleep.
’TIa thus ambition doth itself o’erleap
And straigntway “slither” down the slipp’ry
steep. „
From now, Sir Heaton, “ Henniker,” or “John,
Your title here will be “ Sir Sat-Upon. ’

A new and ingenious method of breaking

learn, the young lady is self-educated and always
had a mechanical turn. Mrs. Norris, landlady of a
pub. at Moorahbln (Vic ), had occasion to “jaw ”
Mary, and the domestic, by way of repartee,
- bashed her with a jug.” Follow, ng up her argu-
ment, the girl broke a tea pot ot s me value over
her mistress’s head, and then, after shleing some
other useful and ornamental articles about the
b.-usc. without waiting for her screw, she with-
drew to the oosom of her family.
Fourteen years ago Ellen Lacy, of Nuna-
wading (Vic.), left that rural seclusion to go to
Melbourne. So far, she has not arrived, nor been
heard of, and her husband, inferring from her
continued absence that she is dead, has applied to
Judge Molesworth for letters of administration to
her estate. Poor Ellen, if she had loft nothing
valuable on earth, her name would long ere this
have been forgotten. But with the perversity of
tne sex she may turn up O K. after all, and spoil
his little game. There was a miner working at
Bendigo not many years ago who went by the
name of De Lacy Evans, lie was a woman. Per-
haps Judge Molesworth remembers her.
“ Many of tbe crimes committed recently
in the colony, and more particularly in Melbourne,
have been so idiosyncratic that they seem to call
for treatment in the hospital rather than in the
gaol.’’ Thus the Melbourne Leader, It is not so
clear that criminal idiosyncrasies are more active
now than at previous periods. A large segment
of each year s circle of crime possesses the charac-
torists of strongly marked individualities. It is
the advance ih knowledge of mental states that
leads some to think that new idiosyncrasies are
being exhibited. However arrived at, the con-
clusion is good. In more and more cases as time
goes on, the hospital w.il take the place of the
gaol, and melielne will work the good which the
“ cat” has failed to perform.
We have received, from Messrs, George
Robertson and Co. a copy of Mr. Robert Louis
Stevenson’s shilling story, “ The strange case of
Hr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, which like most of Mr.
Stevensons books leaves a powerful impression
on the reader s mind. The tale is certainly un-
canny enough to eatisfy the most entnusiastic
admi.er of Hoffmann or Poe. The conception is a
strikingly original one. The Saturday Review
likens it to Poe s “ William Wilson," but we think
the comparison extremely far-fetched. The story
is short—it makes 140 small pages of large print-
hut it is none the less striking tor that. Some of
the papers seem to think that Mr. Stevenson
“underrated the Importance of his central idea,”
and that he should have made his book as long as
“ a. Strange Story.” Had he done so, h:s “central
idea ” would have been drowned in words There
are few authors nowadays who have the courage
to begin a book only when they have something
to tell, and to end it when they have done.
Stevenson is one, Julian Hawthorne another.
Ma y of the other writers might adopt for a
device the needy knife-grinders cry; “Story!
God bless you! 1 have none to tell, sir ” It wouffl
rpoll the reader’s enjoyment of Mr Stevenson’s
story to hint at the plot ; therefore we are dumb.
But let him get it, and if he begin the hook he will
most surely finish it.
The Government Life Insurance Associa-
tion of NZ. has lately appointed a Mrs. Bullock
agent at iVanganul with a view to securing more
or posals from the female sex. Proposals to
assure, of course, we mean. The lady’s name is
very likely to militate against her success. We
have yet to see the lady who was not nearly
scared to death if a cow were walking towards
her at a distance of half a mile, while tne sight ot

We are sorry for you, madam,
On our word we are ma’am, very;
For your chance of making money
At this game is slight indeed,
If your “ screw ” is fixed, you’ve had ’em.
And your agent's life, so merry.
In that land of milk and honey.
You can “ go the pace ” with speed.
But we could have “placed you ” better
If you’d written us before you
Took that little berth of agent,
(Why your name would stop a clock I)
Had you dropped to us a letter
Ere this had Honour o er you
In imaginative pageant, driven just about a
block,
And installed you here in Sydney to insure the
lives of stock.
So many little papers keep on appearing
and having a flutter, just now, in Sydney, that it Is
rather difficult to keep an account of them. In
order, however, to be au courant as to the current
literature of the day, we went into a shop the
other night, purchased all the bantlings, read them
all through and retired to rest in a condition of
extreme dejection la one ot these uproarious
productions somebody (the editor, perhaps,) con-
siders, evident y that he has acquired the art of
* making it ’ : for he comes out with a copy of
verses on Sir Henry Pa kes ot a decidedly
peculiar character The temptation to quote
the whole poem, we own, is great, but we’ll
have this time to content ourselves with two
tanzas Read:—
“ Who though he apes the watch dog's pose.
Is but a wolf in honest cloths, (sic)
And helps himself by others woes? [lll]
The Knight of the tip-tuted nose.
Sir Henry.
Who kept a two-faced diary [l!]
Wnich—may the dev'l admire me I - (sic)
Would only prove just what he choose?
This Knight of the tip-tilted nose,
Sir Henry.
Notwithstanding the heat of the weather, we feel
we must make an effort and deliver unto this un-
fortunate bard a humble homily. Here goes,
then :
It's very easy ain’t it, eh?
You get a “ fay ” to rhyme to “ Bay,”
And then you’re fixed, for bless your heart. I

The other day those benevolent people
the British Tories, stole Burmah from its people
in order that the latter might be given the un-
speakable advantages of a proper religious educa-
tion. Last week it was cabled to Australia that
the ungrateful wretches of fSurmesa were “ re
belling—that a force of 90C0 rebels—armed, pro-
bably, with waddles—had surrounded the Brltisi
garrison at Yemotha, which consists of 860 men
possibly not destitute of Gardner guns and Mat
tlni-Hi nty rifles. Anyhow, it now seems that the
gallant 300 have since got a Jot the bett- r ot tin
trouble, which, were th»ir opponents oieuised Ann
decently-armed troops, would be somewhat sur-
prising. We read that some Interesting experi-
ments in photography are being made by the
British provost-marshal at the Burmese capital.
In the present unsettled state of affairs it happens
that batches of Burmese are led out for exe-
cution every morning before breakfast, and
the provost-marshal, who is quite an enthusiast
with the camera, is anxious to procure some good
negatives of the prisoners at the exact moment
when British bullets lay them low. Accordingly, a®
soon as the wretcbed Burmese are ranged in a
line, and the firing party have received the order
Present I’’ the provost fixes his camera ready for
action. Then he gives the final professional in-
structions No. 1, prisoner, for instance, is re-
quested to “turn a little this way,” No. 2 is desired
to keep his “eyes fixed on the rifles;” No. 3 is
earnestly solicited to “ try to look as pleasant as
possible’’—and so on. Then, just as the order
“ Fire! ” is giv'm, the artist whips off the “ cap,”
and secures his negative. Up to the present these
experiments have not been very successful, be-
cause the fitters—or standers, rather— will tremble
just as the bullets are coming. But as there is
every prospect of executions (by order of the
provost marshal, bear in mind) continuing for
gome time yet, he ought to be able to get a real

The Welsh inhabitants of Ballarat and its
vicinity have been indulging in very virulent
oymric lately. The reason was that they were
Uspleased with the awards given at the recent
Sisteddfodd. What is an Blsteddfodd? Ah, there
rou are. Well, it js a meeting where Taify sings
he songs of his own land in his own mellifluous
congue. Here Is a specimen verse of one of these
vVte may tell you this song always brings down the
house. It is said to have been composed by an old
Welsh bard attached to the court of Owen Glen,
dower (who “could raise spirits from the vasty
deep” whenever he had a mind to), and we are
informed is full of that wild, sweet pathos—that
“sorrow more beautiful than Beauty’s self,” as
Keats says-peculiar to Celtic minstrelsy. We
don’t know much about the language ourselves,
so we can’t say whether all this is true or not, but
we like the sound of the words, rather. They were
sent us by a prominent Eisteddfodder, so we
reckon they are all right. By the way, it is said
that Alice Rees made her debut as a singer at one

As we have informed you several times
previously, we have read some of Mr. Froude's
book about Australia. WeJl, we have, until now,
been in a state of stupeflod surprise as to why
he was so invariably encomiastic about U 3. Now,
we know how it was. He bad never teen in a
Surry Hills boarding-house—just as the hash w# B
being dumped up to the table. If he had I—Well,
be would probably haye branded us all as either
blackfellows or felons. So much, you seo, depends
upon what a man gets to eat. If he had—in order
to study our social life from various points of
view—gone for a week to one of these hash em-
poria, he would have noticed that on the first day
of his stay there would be a fresh joint for dinner
“Hem," he would probably say to himself, “not
very elegant menu, but still good plain food.”
Next morning, when he saw the hacked and
hewn skeleton of that joint put on the table as
the pi(ce de resistance, he might be Inclined to
think that there could be a sort of mo
notony about even good plain food. But he
would be sorry for the thought afterwards—for
he would never see a whole again while he
stayed In that boarding-house. The rest of hlg
time then would be chiefly employed in spearing
with a verdigrlsed fork tor lumps ot fried liver or
mutt n lying at the bottom of as»a of gruesome
gravy, or in grimly gnashing his way along
through serried (and terriole) dishes of hash. And
he would have to be mighty quick about it too, or
the other boarders would leave him o swing his
jaws through vacant air. They never waste time
1“ fastidious preliminaries. They know each other
too well I Th y simply bare their teeth-tnoh
teeth, tool—and wade In. But on Saturday night
he w uid e> joy the stucy ot this phsse of life in

reading. It is late. Suddenly he hears a

THB SQUATTER’S LIFE.
When a squatter’s lost the run of h j employment,
Tanks are empty, sheep all dead about his dam;
His life is not quite cramful of enjoyment—
Hi* lot he’d change for that of any other man;
His feelings he with difficulty smothers.
13 jt his duty It ever must he done—
Taking one consideration with another,
A quitter’s life is not a happy one.
The rabbits, too, are steadily advancing.
Infested soou the stations all will be;
His improvements, too, will go when falls his
lease in,
And the rents increased will put him “up a tree.”
When a pound of wool is fetching only sixpence.
And good sheep are bringing barely half-a-
crown.
When working for the banks and station-agents,
OhJ a Equatter's life is not a happy one.
When the grass and run are pretty well selected,
And the banks begin to gently put on “ screw,”
When no little lambs there are to out the tails off.
The squatter’s apt to look a little blue;
And he thinks he’d better start a magio-lantern,
Upon the tight-ropo put his little son—
Taking one consideration with another,
A squatter's life is not a happy one.
But, when the rain comes down in rushing tor-
rents—
Tanks and dams all brimming full and running
o’er;
Sheep and lambs are all as fat as grass can make
’em,
The squatter says he’ll “ whip the cat” no mbre.
Pour horses now he thinks will just but do him.
For the grass is green and waving on the run,
The banks, he thinks, need now no longer screw
him,
Oh I the squatter’s life Is now a happy one.

Mr. D, M. Davies represents Grenville in
the Victorian Assembly. According to tho Argus
summary ot politicians' politics, Mr. Davies “ is
opposed to pensions, but advocates voting morey
to deserving members of the House.” Such senti-
ments must not go unsung:—
In these days of "jobs” and ‘'favours,” when the
public funds are spent—
Nay squandered-rather recklessly by th se to
whom they’re lent,
’Tls rare, ’tis very rare, indeed, one senator to
find
Who don’t approve of shady tricks, and plainly
speaks bis mind.
But such a one, it now appears, was lately on the
stump
(Among the legislative cards we pick him as a
trump),
The sentiments that he expressed did honour to
his heart—
He stands from other members on a platform quite
apart.
A keen regard has Davies for the people and their
purse;
He’d keep tho strings pulled tightly, nor would
willingly disburse
Stray thousands to the widows ®f the public men
who die
And haven’t been so frugal as to’put a little by.
He don’t approve the custom (and he puts the
matter straight)
Of letting played-out people’lhe a burden on the
State;
fee is quite opposed to pensions, and would no-
thing give away,
Except—a grant ot money to a needy M.L.A.
Now, that’s the sort of patriot ,we look on with
delight,
Who draws a sharp distinction ’twlxt what is
wrong and right ;
The “ members of the House ” alone would he by
grant enrioh—
There are a few deserving ones—and h© knows
which is which.
And if it—oh, the Lord forbid!—should ever com*
to pass
That D. Is out of collar and in want of any braes,
We hope his worthy colleagues won’t be mean
enough to “ohowse”
Him out of what is due to decent “ members cl
the House.”

UNFORTUNATE GUBBINS.
The London correspondent of an Austra-
lian daily paper writes that one of the conse.
quinces of the action of the National League in
Ireland was that “Mr. Gubbins has had to sell his
hounds and hunters preparatory to leaving the
county of Limerick.” Great heavens I Can this
?. e lTX tu ? T> If 8 °’ lfc 18 t00 ’ to ° much * and Jt 1« quite
time the British Government acted upon the Bug-
gestion of the correspondent, and made “the re-
conquest of Ireland, la the meantime abrogating"
its constitutional rights,” Prose is too feeble for
such a theme. Our blood boils when we think of
it. Up till now we had sympathised with the Irish
people. We honestly thought they had something
to complain of. We thought they had been, in a
measure, opposed, and even downtrodden, but
this last desperate wickedness of theirs has
alienated from them our sympathies far ever
Henceforth whatever the Sydney Morning
Hebadd and the Argtts may say upon the Irish
question shall be to us as authentic as Holy Writ,
Nevermore shall we cavil at their utterances on
this subject. Nevermore shall we Insinuate that
their correspondents have coloured their letters
so as to suit a certain class of readers. All this la
over and done with now. We repent of our
heresy in sackcloth and ashes. We wash our
hands of the Irish and their grievances from this
hour. Mush we could have stood from them;
much we could have forgiven from a race strug-
gling—as rve, In our benighted ignorance, believed
—for the right to live In their own country and
tbtir means of living. But this to Gubbias-neverl
Boy, bring the gall! Now for some bitter lines
Ho, Irish miscreants, hear!
Ho, traitors, tremble now!
This crime will cost you dear I
Gubbins, It will—we vow I
Gubbins!—would heaven you had
A better name for rhyme I—
We'll make them skip like mad,
My boy, for that same crime.
Vipers! lhat bit the hand
That struck them (but in mirth);
We’ll sweep them from the land I
We’& wipe them from the earth!
They might—these Irish gnomes—
Have raised seditious shout,
They might have from their homes
Sworn dark'y when turned out-
They might have cur8d4to see-
Mother, and wHe. and chHdi
Cast out,to die, still we—
We only would have smiled.
But this—tfcis fills the cup.
When round the Empire’s bounds
R'ngs the heart-breaking yell—
” Gubbins has had to sell
His hunters and his hounds!”
By heavens, this breaks us up!
Yes, ye shall have no voice
In your fate—know this well I—
And no more Cromwell’s choice;
“To Connaught—or to h j.”
For Connaught they require
To hunt in, so they do,
Each gallant Gubbins squire—
So h—-I must do for you.
Then Britons get up-rise I
For what’s its name and crown ?
And cut and mow them down.
And sweep them In the sea,
“ Gubbins and Glory ” be
Your war-cry—A— b your eyes!

Miss Pitt, daughter of Mr. G. M. Pitt, of
Holbrook, Bt. Leonards, Invited about 80 guests to
witness a performance by a company of private
theatricals of the farce, “ Who a Who,” last Mon-
day night, at Myers’ Assembly Rooms. The piece
had evidently been well rehearsed, and every
crebit is due to the hostess and her clever co-ad-
jutors for the success of the affair. As soon as the
curtain fell the room was speedily cleared for
dancing, which, as the night was tolerably cool,
was very enjoyable.

A pretty wedding eventuated at St. John’s
Church, Parramatta, on the 9dr Inst., when Miss
Alice Bray, of Grahamville was married to Mr. J.
F. Chr, of Normanton, Queensland. The bride
wore a charming gown of ivory satin and lace, and
wreath of orange-blossom, jessamime, and
clematis. The five bridesmaids wore! frocks of
cream Indian muslin with bows of old gold and
pale-blue ribbon, and bonnets of cream tulle.
After the dejeuner the happy pair left by train for
Moss Vale to honeymoon.
* * *
A dance was given by Mr. H. S. Bird at his
residence, Welbeck, Kedmyre, on Thursday, the
11th Inst., previous to the departure of his son for
Europe. The music, which was orovided by Mrs.
Bentley, was very good, and the floor was perfect.
Chinese lanterns were hung around the verandahs
and grounds, also in the pretty fernery. Miss
Braham looked very well m black, handsomely
jetted; Mrs. G. Bird, in white with terracotta
sash and gloves, looked nice; Miss Fairfax looked
pretty in pink relieved with white lace; another
pretty pink, which *as composed of mousaeiino
de soie with silk bodice, was worn by Miss Frayer.
Only one blue satin was to be seen, but it did not
suit the woarer. A very striking and peculiar cos-
tume was competed of dull cerise silk and gold net,
the draperies and bodice being ornate with bullion
tassels; Miss Price, in heliotrope silk, completely
covered with white lace, 100 ed very pretty. Very
lew blacks were to be seen, but, perhaps, the
pretliest were donned by two of the best dancers
in the room, two sisters. Miss Fairfax chose a
pretty white, relieved by pale-blue bows; Mis.
Sly looked pretty in pale-pink; two young ladies
in cream nun s veiling and lace looked cool. A
very pretty little fairy in very pale-pink danced
well. At half-past 1 a special train left the station
to convey the guests to Sydney.

At the Sydney Synagogue o a Tuesday last
Mabel, the eldest daughter of Mr. Fred. Conen, of

eldest son of Mr. Lewis Cohen, of Murella, Wil-
liam-street. The bridesmaids were Misses Kate
and Ruse Cohen, Dolly Solomon, Rebecca Law-
rence, and a little mite, Dolly Gabriel, The
bride looked particularly handsome in a mag-
nificent white satin, elaborately brocaded,
aud the bridesmaids kept her in counteE-
ance by the beauty of their costumes and
faces, the sisters of the bride, and little Dully
Gabriel were in all-white. The mother of the
bride, Mrs. F Cohen, was attired in a rich brocade
velvet, and the bridegroom’s mother wore a green
brocade of great beauty Rabbi Davis officiated.

Last Thursday, March 11, All Saints’
Caurcb, Petersham, wastne scene of a very pretty
wedding, when Miss Ada Cubitt, second daughter
of Alderman Cubitt, of Crownthorpe, Stanmore,
was united to Mr, Greville J. Lswis. The bride s
dress was of rich ivory satin, the front of the
skirt draped with soft iaoe and tulle, caught up
with sprays of orange blossom, the long train
being trimmed with sprays of same; wreath of
orange and myrtle blossom, with long tulle veil,
completed a most charming and effective costume.
The bride carried a very large bouquet, and her
only ornament was a very handsome gold bracelet
set with diamonds and rubies, the gift of the
bridegroom. The bridesmaids, four in number,
were Mieses Cubitt, Kennedy. M’Kenzle and Fer-
guson, and wore ivory flowered muslins, two with
panels and vests of eau de vie satin, and two with
shrimp pink. All wore little mob bonnets, com-
posed of net and lace, with a racking of satin to
match their dresses, with lace strings tied
under the chin, high tan gloves, and carried
large bouquets,' given by the bridegroom
The ceremony was performed by the Rev.
J. D. Langley, incumbent of St. Phillips’.
The chancel was decorated with large arches,
festoons, and wreaths of evergreens and white
flowers, which had a charming effect. Mrs.Cubitfs
dress was a combination of dark brown satin
and broche of a lighter shade, bonnet of pale pick
tulle, with feathers. Amongst the guests soma
very handsome costumes were noticeable. One
lady wore a dark green Ottoman velvet trimmed
with deep lace, embroidered with gold; another
wore a handsome black silk trimmed with rich
black lace of jet ornaments, black straw bonnet
trimmed with black velvet and pale pink feathers.
The church was crowded with interested specta-
tors, who showered the bride and bridegroom
with nee and flowers as they walked down the
aisle. The bridal patty retired to Crownthorpe.
where breakfast was laid. The bride’s travelling
dress was of ficelle canvas trimmed with shot-pUk
silk, white net bonnet, wltn black velvet bows and
strings.

Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,— Things socially are looking
just a trifle livelier since last I wrote. You know
when we arrive at the very end of a season, be it
summer or winter, we have a way of surfeiting
ourselves with pleasures peculiar to the time of
year, just at the last moment, as if we were sorry
we were about to give them up for fresh enjoy-
ments. I suppose
“We do not know how much we love until we
come to leave.”
Eh ? So, then, we are having garden parties,
cricket matches, and various other kind of
matches almost every day, till I begin to think
that, unless we determinedly make up our minds
to repose for a few weeks before the winter season
commences, there will be nothing left of us but a
bag of bones, which won’t facilitate conquests,
will it ? Whenever Lady Carington has breathing
time allowed her between her multitudinous
social duties, she betakes herself to Moss Yale to
get cool, rest, and see her babies, I strongly* sus-
pect, however, that the latter prove the strongest
magnets. I very much wanted to go to the Moss
Yale Show, but our desires, and what is possible to
us are two very different things, so I had to
refuse a very pressing Invitation and be dubbed
“ unsociable ” and “ disagreeable,” when all the
time I longed to go. But it’s quite in the order of
things in this funny world of ours to be cruelly
censured when all the time one is practising an
act of the utmost self-denial, have you not found
it so ? I told you nothing of the Liedertafel con-
cert in my last, which was, I own, very remiss, and
now, of course, you have gleaned all you want to
know from other sources. Between ourselves,
however, I hardly think the affair deserved the
high encomiums it receivedlfrom nearly all sides,
for, taking it altogether, what did it amount to?
The choruses were sung well it’s true, but the
orchestral selections were poorly rendered, Mrs.
Riley’s singing disappointing, the trombone solo
quite unworthy, and Mr. Hallewell’s solo, “ The
Village Blacksmith,” grows just a trifle mono-
tonous. Then, of course, as the latter gentleman
was run In just at the last moment as a substitute
for Mr. Harry Woods, who was suffering from a
cold, I dare say he chose a song which was safe to
please the many, and which he was certain of re-
membering without his music, then, as a matter
of course, •* Simon ” followed as an encore. Mr.
Pier sang his solo pleasantly, rather. So much for
the music. It appears to me that Mr. Delaney,
though a first-rate musician, Is too nervous to make
a good conductor. Little Boodles said of him
“ When any of us make a mistake, Delaney looks
awfully scared, but Vogrich used to make ms
look scared if we made a slip, and that’s just the
difference between the two men.” Rather neat,
wasn’t it?
The officers from the German squadron were in-
vited to the concert, and were treated anything
but courteously, in that there were no seats for
them when they arrived. Their massive forms
towered above all toe other men present, and
they were quite a feature of the concert. Lord
Carington, seeing their plight, sent an aide to in-
vite them to join his party, but what sort of
management was that which left Invited guests
and strangers withal to fight for seats at a Lieder-
taffel concert? At the same time, the society
transgressed its rules and reserved seats for a few
favoured ones, who hadn’t any more claim to the
consideration than the other 3000 present. Old and
valued members of the society are crying out at
this p eoe of injustice, and are so hurt about it
that I don't think they intend to let the nutter
drop until they have made quite certain that the
like will not occur again. “First come, first
served,” has always been the rule at these con-
certs, but if things are to be changed, the
society should at least acquaint the public
with their intentions. One man a subscription fee
is worth as much as another’s, and he should be
able to claim exactly the same privileges. It
seemed like old times, however, to see Mr. tiuem r-
bem’s name down as accompanist, and Mr. Harry
Woods, as soloist, but I snould have to tear my
conscience right up by the roots if I told you as
the morning papers did that it was a most excel-
lent concert and well wortny of the Society. I
wish—oh, how 1 wish-I hadn’t a conscience, for
it’s lar nicer to say pleasant things than the re-
verse—but there, that s enough.
We had begun to think it had forgotten how to
ram till last Saturday, the day set aside for the
picnic given to the German officers by the Mini -
ters, when we were greeted with as dismal and
damp a day as you can well imagine. I never
dreamed anybody would be mad enough to go up
the mountains, of all places, in such a drizzle;
but, sure enough, about 50 hardy pleasure-seekers
dragged themselves from their cosy beds at 7
o clock In the morning and met at the Kedfern
station with “ blue cold nose and wrinkled brow,”
and most of them who were really weather-wise,
provided with overcoats and ulsters, tne
sight of which were quite enough to depress
one’s spirits for the day. But still there
was not a little fun squeezed out of the train
journey, and had the German strangers been able
to see anything of the grand mountain scenery as
they went up, it would have been quite worth
their while rising early that morning, but you
know what the Blue Mountains look like on a wet
day, don’t you, dear ? The sun came out grudg-
ingly for a little while on the return trip, which
was extremely tantalising, as it just gave every-
body a taste of what mlgnt have been had the day
been other than what it was. Admiral Knorr
made himself very popular, and gave a neat little
speech. Somebody said his broken English was
rather too much so, but for my part, I prefer
broken English to cracked ditto. There is gener-
ally a good deal of the latter spoken at these
gatherings in Sydney.
You need not scoff so much about my reluct-
ance, to sit down to a table when the company
numbers 13, and the two instances I have already
given you of the unfortunate oousequenoes of so
doing in our own household are not, as you would
persuade me, mere acciuents. Now, do not try to
talk me out of this-well, call it whim if you like
—but I have noticed that everybody nas his or her
pet superstition, and the fatal number of 13 is
mine. You, I know, would almost sooner die tuan
carry a peacock-feather fan or have your dress
trimmed with the pretty peacock trimming, which
leather, you protest, is so unlucky, and have I
not respected your—well, whim—by refraining
from .sending you either fan or trimming! Cer-
tainly I have, so now leave me alone about the
baker’s dozen and listen to this, please. Foor King
Ailouso visited Arauguez last summer and sat
down to dine in the oaiace in the company of 12
other persons. Tne King quiokiy observed the
latal number, but whilst deeply superstitious
about it, was too proud to fues, and laughingly
affected to treat the matter as a jest and asked to
nave a list of the names of the company, so that
he might know if anjoue should die within the
year. Twelve of the guests still live, but the
thirteenth was King Alfonso. There, does that
shake you at all ?
I believe the baseballers are going to play a
match here soon, which will be Quite a change
from cricket. Ned speaks rather contemptuously
of the game—says it is milk-soppy. I fancy he
means there is little danger In it. and, you know,
an Englishman attaches little importance to a
sport which doesn't savour of broken limbs,
abraded contusions, and that sort of thing. Very
savage of them, isn’t it? but we call It manly
and like it; as much as we dis-hke seeing men
carry fans. One olzzlirg hot day last week I met
two dudes in George-street carrying a large palm-
leaf fan, and the eight was so revolting that I felt
as if I could have shaken them; and yet there Is
no reason on earth why men should notcool them-
selves as well as women if they wish it, is there ?
I suppose it is simply this, that we have been
brought up in the belief that men are quite above
feeling the discomfort of heat, hunger, fatigue,
bullets, and cricket balls, so it is a bit of a shock to
us when we see them carrying fans like women.
It usvd to irritate me to see the Frenchmen playing
their favourite game of “ catchers.” They take a
large soft indiarubber ball and throw it to each
other to catch, and those who never miss are the
best players. It seemed so utterly absurd to see
big men devoting their time to so innocent and
uneventful a pastime as this At all events, base
ball cannot be so ridiculously undangerous, but I
shall not be able to give you my true impressions
until I have seen the match, so you just wait.
The German officers gave a nice dance on Mon-
day afternoon on board the warship Gneisenau,
which was just as pleasant as it Is possible for a
day-time dance to be. The Nelson and Swinger
are both in port again, and now really I think this
is all I have time to tell you in this. Just think of
it! Last week when I wrote to you we were
frizzling with the heat, and now, to-day, I write in
front of a cosy Are.
Ever your loving
MAB.
JACK’S ABOUT.
Sailors and their adventures have ever been a
favourite subject with poets, song writers, and
novelists. Diddin, Campbell, Marryat, Scott, Coo-
per, Russell, and Hannay have depicted Jack to us
in such fascinating form that we have come to sur-
round him with a halo of romance, and endow him
with every virtue of heroism and chivalry. Nor
are we wholly unjustified in doing this. The sailor
take him alt in all, is a line fellow —simple, loyal,
brave, and honest, and we should never permit
our judgment of his character to be warped by
occasional illustrations of exceptional vices. His
occupation is of a kind to inspire in the dullest and
most uncuttured nature that awe and reverence
for the Power by whom the ocean is ruled. He
daily realises the fact that but one plank rests
between him and eternity. He is constantly re-
minded that his skill and strength are but as a
babe’s when the Lord of storm and Ruler of the
winds puts forth His hand. Subjscted to these
impressions, and necessarily prompted to high
thought land humble trust, the sailor must bo in a
bad case indeed who is an irredeemable scoundrel.
Perhaps the best evidence of his nobility of nature
is given in his ready susceptibility to refined in-
fluences. Take Ja.k from the forecastle, and give
him a command, and probably no other man, even
with superior advantages, so rapidly developes in to
the frank and cordial gentleman, who accepts his
position of host to his pasiengers as confidently
and easily as any person of truth and position.
In taking these facts into consideration, we must
remember that the sailor’s life is hard indeed ; not
only has he to encounter peril to life, but the con-
ditions of his occupation are such as lay tne seeds
of disease in many forma. Subjected to cold and
heat, soaked through one day, grilled the next, lay-
ing out on a yard to gather in a sail frozen to tne
stiffness of a deal board, or panting in a hot fore-
castle, and praying fora wind, as his ship rolls in
the doldrums in equatorial seas—his constitution
is subjected to extraordinary strain and trial. At
this moment, in hospitals all over the world, poor
Jack lies stricken down by fever, kidney and liver
complaints, rheumatism, ague, and shattered
bones. Yet his hope and confidence are inexhaus-
tible, and so far as moral influence is concerned, in
fighting sickness, he is possessed of exceptional
powers of resistance.
But powerful as the will may be, in crushing
back the assault of disease, it is not enough. 1 1
asserts the action of medicines, but it cannct
accomplish a cure without their aid. As an
illustration we find Captain John Balfour, of
Latrobe Terrace, West Geelong, thus testifying to
the value of a remedial agent. The Captain says:
“ Having tried many different medicines for liver
and kidney disordeis, I must s?,y I know of none t »
eoual Warner s safe cure and safe pills. I have
recommended them on all hands, and will continue
to do so.” This is a pretty conclusive testimony
to the wisdom of restoring to the use of a specific
whose reputation and virtues have been established
by long and exhaustive experience. Many a sailor,
in every part of the world, could this day endoise
with ready gratitude the statement just quoted.
And this is a reflection which rises superior to any
sordid commercial question. It is doubtless plea-
sant to mahe money; but the gratification is
tenfold, and its influence become purified aud
ennobled, when it is charged with the knowledge
that thousands of the human race have been re-
lieved and made happy by the pioces r ,

It is astonishing the favour in which
Wolfe's Schnapps is held—We suppose because
it is a flrst-olass article.
Persons who labour under the impression
that the youth of Australia have no taste for
anything except sport, fill their heads with a great
mistake indeed. Some of Our Boys search as
earnestly in the field of science as a goat does in a
cook-shop dust-bin, and young Master Edison
Huxley Jinks, of Balmain, is a very fair sample of
this species. Noticing that his soup was largely
impregnated with flies of late, he sat down in a
cool spot, and woolled his head about until he dis-
covered a remedy for the evil in a new style of
fly-paper, which he manufactures out of a blot-
ting sheet covered with dynamite, glue and
treacle. The foolish files being attracted by the
treacle, alight alight for a picnic, and are held fast
by the glue. Should any get away, they at once
begin to kick themselves for joy, when the first
crack causes the dynamite adfierlng to their feet
to explode, and the careful manner in which they
are tnen distributed to the tour corners of the
globe saves their friends the expenses of a funeral.
Inventions like this deserve a suitable reward, and
we are plased to say Master Jinks has received bis
in the shape of a Christmas suit from Summerfleld
and Co., 335 and 337 Pitt-street *

The Sir Joseph Banks handioappers have
. u„t un lately by the Murtoad Mudslinger
Sns the Yarra walla Star,; lor their work in
®“ neo tlon with the recent running. They should
?a?e a lesson from the Bermagui people. A cor-
raanondentwrites:— “I nominated for the Boxing
mv handicap as 50 years of age, married, nine
ihi idren Per fo rmance: ‘ Ran one© in 1862, beaten
£“ 45 yards.’ Of course I had no intention of ac-
'“'Jimr but entered to assist the sport. When the
handicap came out I had nine yards in 150; two
vnnng fellows were two yards In front of me
and three-behind me. I discovered their
«vstem subsequently. Beginning with the oldest,
thev ulace him on scratch and work downwards,
a vard at a time, till they get through the men,
when the youngest and smartest are so far ahead
nf the scratch man that he cannot see them with
a telescope. In the Veterans’ Handicap, the same
dav a white-headed old blaokfellow was scratch,
four old men on the 4yds mark, and a man 37
t ears of age on the tiyds. He won. This is a Bar-
magui mystery, and though I have cleared it up. I
oaonot regard it as a scientific system of handi-
oapplng.” , * *
The Melbourne Sportsman's “Vigilant”
tipster, speaking of Malua s defeat on Newmarket
day, waxed sarcastic at the expense of the griev-
ing ones whr> backed the famous nag, and went on
to ridicule the notion which some people possess
that, because a horse wins a big event once in his
career, he is worthy of any amount of confidence
ever after. “ A prad blossoms once in a lifetime,
not yearly,” said the oracle. This reads very well,
and “ Vigilant ” was proud until Malua took it
into his equine cranium to win the Australian Cup
in the fastest time on record. Then the prophet
bade all his friends adieu, and went and broke the
Piedge. + * * ■
It begins to look as though the Israelite
coup, so long anticipated by the racing nubile,
would never come off. Ever since the "Jew’s”
sensational win at Flemlngton, in the spring of
1888, he has been looked on as a “ rod In- pickle ”
for one of the big handicaps. However, the
horse’s three latest performances make It appear
that he Is not now—whatever he might once have
been-so dangerous as many people'imagined.
One thing is certain, Mr. Crozier’s handsome nag
was as fit as a fiddie at Flemlngton, and presum-
ably his best form was shown.
♦ ♦ ♦
The two most notable features of the la,te
Y.S.C. meeting were Malua and the deaf, dumb,
and blind bookmaker. There is something weird
and wonderful about the way in which this
“book” does business. First of all his clerk
takes hold of his hands and plays a sort of tune
upon the fingers. Then the governor rattles off a
lively waltz upon his own fingers. That means,
"seewhether 6to 4 will fetch ’em.” Then the
clerk yells out, issues tickets to any stray cus-
tomers, and duly records each transaction in the
book, while the bead of the firm stands meekly at
his side waiting to be enlightened as to whether
anything is goicg op. It is an uncanny spectacle
altogether. Yet, perhaps, the d„ d. and b. book-
maker has a better head for figures and a better
memory for performances than any other man in
the ring. Perhaps, too, he has a profound faith in
the morality of the turf. At any rate, he can
never see a horse pulled.
* * •
The haild leap ping of certain horses at the
V.R.C. meetings has been commented on rather
unfavourably. The weight allotted to Lesblain
the Autumn Handicap on “ Champion ” day was
so favourable that even .the most amateur of
packers had no difficulty in spotting the mare as
the pick of the basket. And this is not the only
nmethat Leshla has been “thrown into” nice
tj 1 ™ stakes On the other hand, Mozart was
nanmoapped at least a stone above his form in one
wo events, and his owner struck him out
directly the weights appeared.

AYER’S
Cherry Pectoral.
No other complaints are so insidious in their
attack as those affecting the throat and lungs:
none so trifled with by the majority of suffer-
ers. The ordinary cough or cold, resulting
perhaps from a trifling or unconscious ex-
posure, is often but the beginning of a fatal
sickness. Ayer’s Cheery Pectoral has
well proven its efficacy in a forty years’ fight
with throat and lung diseases, and should be
taken in all cases without delay.
A Terrible Cough Cured.
“In 18571 took a severe cold, which affected
my lungs. I had a terrible cough, and passed
night after night without sleep. The doctors
gave me up. I tried Ayer’s Cherry Pec-
toral, which relieved my lungs, induced
sleep, and afforded me the rest necessary
for the recovery of my strength. By the
continued use of the Pectoral a perma-
nent cure was effected. I am now 62 years
old, hale and hearty, and am satisfied your
Cherry Pectoral saved me.
Horace Fairbrotheb."
Rockingham, Yt., July 15,1882.
® Croup. A Mother’s Tribute.
“ While in the country last winter my little
boy, three years old, was taken ill with croup;
it seemed as if he would die from strangu-
lation. One of the family suggested the use
of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, a bottle of
which was always kept in the house. This
was tried in small and frequent doses, and
to our delight in less than halt an hour the
little patient was breathing easily. The doc-
tor said that the Cherry Pectoral had
.saved my darling’s life. Can you wonder at
our gratitude ? Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Emma Gedney.”
159 West 128th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
“ I have used Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral
in my family fer several years, and do not
hesitate to pronounce it the most effectual
remedy for coughs and colds we have ever
tried. A. J, Crane.”
Lake Crystal, Minn., March 13, 1882.
” I suffered for eight years from Bronchitis,
and after trying many remedies with no suc-
cess, I was cured by the use of Ayer’s Cher-
ry Pectoral. Joseph Walden.’*
Byhalia, Miss., April 5,1882.
‘‘l cannot say enough in praise of Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral, believing as I do that
but for its use I should long since have died
from lung troubles. E. Bragdon.”
Palestine, Texas, April 22, 1882.
No case of an affection of the throat or
lungs exists which cannot be greatly relieved
by the use of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral,
and it will always cure when the disease is
not already beyond the control of medicine.

Oarnrick’s Cod Liver Oil&Mllk
’ PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medidal Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &g.
It will produce an immediate gain fe flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil are refused.'
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver'Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptonised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil, and
makes it as sweet as cream: very palatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
plain oil or any other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most nerfect Emulsion ever
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphitea
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.

Important to Mothers&Nws
Oarnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Pood ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of the solids of milk (digested),
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect mod. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk over made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, fleshy and bOUG, and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed 'lUpon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attaoked : by infantile dis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
“CARNRICK’S SOLUBLE POOD” is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
hi nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient for use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.
