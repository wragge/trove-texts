The Week’s Best: —
DAZZLING BOOK
BY A
SYDNEY GIRL
Christina Stead,
author of The
Salzburg Tales,
and daughter of
one of Sydney’s
best-known scien-
tists, has put forth, through Peter Davies,
London, another book, Seven Poor Men
of Sydney. As it is a work of fiction, it
will probably be classed as a novel, but
it is no more a novel than Furphy’s Such
Is Life. It is rather a diabolically clever
collection of rambling philosophical
essays and satires, given voice by vari-
ous different characters, without form,
but far from being void.
The scenes are set around Watson’s
Bay and Central Sydney, but the char-
acters—the seven poor men and their
lady friends—are a collection which
could not be found were you to pass
the whole mil-
lion of Sydney’s
inhabitants
through a hair
sieve.
The book is
built around
certain me m-
be r s of the
Baguenault
family. The
Baguenault
father and
mother are
poor Irish of
French ances-
try. They are
living at Wat-
son’s Bay—for
some unknown
reason called
Christina Stead.
Fisherman’s Bay —with the children
at school, when the father inherits
£5OOO, and they move to Warrawee,
which hardly comes into the picture
at all. The father is a cipher, the mother
is a repentant sinner, pious in her middle
age. It is the son Michael and the sister
Catherine who are the central figures of
the drama.
Like nearly all the characters in the
book, Michael is quite unnatural. He is
an introvert, and finds joy in none of
the pleasures of youth or of middle age.
He finishes over the Gap, around which
he played in his childhood. He falls
in love twice, once with a girl who is
engaged to another man and who keeps
him at arm’s length. It is through her
influence that he goes to a war in which
he has no interest, and on Blighty leave
has a 100-per-cent, love affair with a
girl who turns up later in Australia as
the wife of a friend. That is all. Suicide
is the logical finish —the only finish—to
such a man as Michael.
Catherine, described as a “nun in
reverse,” is more human. She runs
away from home at 15 and, a born vaga-
bond, works at anything that comes
along, is an artist’s model for a while,
and finds final solace in fighting society
as a militant Communist. Joseph Bague-
nault, to whom the greater part of the
book is devoted, is a shadowy form wlio
is really of little account and not nearly
so picturesque as his cousins.
Much space is given to the activities
of Sydney’s Communistic intelligentsia,
and the reader may be forgiven if he
lays down the book murmuring “Almost
persuadest me to be a moron,” for none
of these intellectuals is a lovable char-
acter. Michael is a horrible prig. Before
he leaves school he has a talk with his
teacher, and addresses him thus:—-
I assure you, if I believed in God, l
would do nothing at all but sink into His
bosom. Be reasonable; any action at all
would be away from God. The wells of
nature, love, ambition, understanding,
sleep, gush in us as oil and water in the
world and blood in the heart. I follow
them lamely; it is I who do their bidding,
in following my bent. Listen, is the world
full of spirits, as the mind? I see no
will or obedience in anything, only the
abrupt, spontaneous will and generation.
It causes the reader to hope that the
teacher observed sternly: “Baguenault,
write that out five hundred times before
Saturday.”
Again, when Michael discovers that
his mother is an adultress and he hijn-
self not old Baguenault’s son, he thinks:
“Who would have thought the old girl
had it in her?” while Catherine, when
he passes on the news, observes: “I
never knew she had the guts. I’ve mis-
judged her.” These cheerful children
are devoted to each other, and, when the
repentant mother weeps over Catherine
as a sinner, Michael cries indignantly
“You don’t know that you have a mag-
nificent daughter, a rebel, a gallant
character.”
When he is eighteen, Michael comes
under the . influence of 24-year-old
Withers —clever, selfish, good-natured
rotter. Not content with being vicious
himself, Withers endeavors to initiate the
boy into the mysteries of vice.
Withers keeps a book of “prospects’
—damsels whom it may be possible to
seduce. He acts the philanthropist and
permits Michael to take a few notes. It
is one of these which leads to Michael’s
unreciprocated love affair. It is another
which Michael attempts, but retires de-
feated. He could not get near the young
lady. The glad tidings had evidently
been widely advertised among the lads
of the village. “Every time I go there,”
he complains to Withers, “it’s like a
meeting of preference shareholders.”
The sanest and most decent character
in the book is Baruch Mendelsohn, the
Yankee Jew who works in the same
struggling printing works as Withers and
Michael. Like all the rest, Baruch is a
highbrow, but he is able to see the prac-
tical side of life. He is a Communist in
theory, but' he knows that the Revolu-
tion is not going to be ac-
complished by singing the
Red Flag and assaulting the
police.
A foil to Baruch is
Winter, who conducts the
Communist library. Winter
is suspicious of the intelli-
gentsia. The proletariat has
been betrayed too many
times, and he looks with
disfavor on any educated
person who professes to
accept his own views: all
the same he makes just as
long speeches as the rest,
and, though the spelling in-
dicates a dialect, his phrases
and his erudition are those
of a-university man.
Seven Poor Men of Syd-
ney is a remarkable book
if only for its virtuosity. Miss Stead
is in the master class as a phrase-
maker and a delineator of original
philosophies. She has also taken her
place in the ranks of those who can show
the literary world that Australia can
produce works other than those dealing
with adventure and romantic love. The
trouble is that all her characters are as
clever as herself and as artificial as those
in a Lonsdale comedy. When you have
finished the last page, you feel sym-
pathetic towards the character who cries
in utter desperation: “Your low high-
brow talk will drive me frantic. I’m
going to tell a dirty story to get you into
the right frame of mind.”
MONTAGUE GROVER.
Howard’s
New Novel
Sundry Red
Page writers on
the Australian
novel, among
them Norman
Lindsay, have
pleaded for the treatment of modern city
life, in which an attempt should be made
not only to express the “locality” sense
as truly as Louis Stone did in Jonah and
Betty Wayside, but to present characters
whose talk, behavior and emotional ex-
periences should be recognisable by Aus-
tralians who know their cities. These
writers have pointed out that we have
Madame Bovarys in plenty and that
Proust and Romains write about under-
grads. and others who are as much Aus-
tralian as French ; so that the establish-
ment of a definite aesthetic for the Aus-
tralian novel rested less on emotional
conflict, which is the same everywhere,
than on the writers’ understanding of
our individual and national conscious-
ness. I have no doubt that Stewart
Howard was prompted by these con-
siderations when he came to write his
second novel, Forty-Six, which capably
and conscientiously describes a not-un-
familiar phase of modern Sydney’s night
life.
Into four days of hectic movement from
Stewart Howard.
cafe to night' club, up and
down the harbor and along
the coast, Howard care-
fully compresses the story
of Richard Westring’s life-
time of forty-six years.
West ring has arrived at that
age free from material
anxieties but unable tem-
peramentally to keep clear
of amorous entanglements.
His first wife turns up, with
their 18-year-old son, to un-
settle him after many years;
his second is “so beautiful,
oh, of course, but so unin-
terested, so passionless, so
cold”; and there are the
two very possessive crea-
tures, Enid and Helen,
whose silken cords tie him
down. As a young man
he had written some stories which had
been praised by the Falstaffian Lewis,
poet and Elizabethan scholar, and he
had started on a novel; but all prospects
of a literary career had been sacrificed
to material promotion. Now he has
lost all faith in his capacity to do posi-
tive things. The success of his son in
selling a couple of stories to a London
review hurts him terribly ; and, looking
back on more than 20 years of “nothing
but weakness, regrets and women,” he
decides to cut the knot.
The story is one that is true, in one form
or another, of the numerous Westrings we
are acquainted with, but the means of
escape are not always so convenient.
The employment of reverie in the
construction of Forty-Six is skil-
fully carried out—in those enjoyable
pages describing Westring’s life with his
little boy, in those recalling his early
days and ambitions as a writer, and in
those towards the end which link up his
life in the South Seas on the Southern
Queen with the Caroline Larsen in the
harbor and the freedom that ship pro-
mises from the silken cords.

The local sense, too, is there. One
remembers Norman Lindsay’s illustra-
tion of the Sydney girl who sees herself
in print, herself and her boy on the way
to Manly, and how different that is
from reading the printed account of a
girl and her boy in London. Lena’s
restaurant in Castlereagh-street, from
which the party emerges on its way to
“that new place the Chou-Chou—l hear
it’s awfully good,” and Westring’s reflec-
tions in the street as “smoke-grey even-
ing gives way to blue-black night” ; and
his own and Helen’s run in the car to
Newport: these, among other passages,
illustrate the author’s understanding of
the personality of the Sydney we live in.
It seems a pity more of the Elizabethan
Lewis’s conversation was not given. He
promises well with his observations on
women writers and The Apes of God
and the manufacture of liqueurs, but the
rest of him is just drunken fumbling.
The three women are well done, each
recognisable.
Howard writes with a cleanliness of
statement not often found in novels de-
voted to the amorous perplexities of
middle age. For that, as for his sin-
cerity and good craftsmanship, and for
the definitely modern Australian note he
strikes in Forty-Six, he deserves thanks.
I for one am eager to See his next novel.
CAMDEN MORRISBY.
Normal and
Abnormal
Man
“The highly
specialised type
of mind,” says
H. A. Lindsay
(R.P. 14/11 / ’34),
“through being
concentrated upon a narrow field, can
become very learned in some directions ;
but this can also lead to other portions
of the brain becoming atrophied through
disuse or remaining in a state of child-
like undevelopment, producing an indi-
vidual akin to genius in some ways and
a child, idiot or beast in others.”
I am not an authority on the struc-
ture of the brain, but I fancy that Mr.
Lindsay is wasting his time conducting
exploring expeditions in that mysterious
region at present. His ideas of the
genius are too quaint and unsophisticated
as yet. They smack of the tea-party in
the suburban manse.
He says that Banjo Paterson met' so
many famous men who were libertines,
alcoholics and moral lepers that he was
delighted and relieved to meet Rudyard
Kipling and find he was a sober, decent
husband, father, citizen, friend and busi-
nessman. Civilisation and society,
according to Mr. Lindsay, were thus
saved. Personally, I don’t think Banjo
Paterson is such a blithering idiot and
simpleton as Mr. Lindsay unconsciously
makes him out to be.
By his Normal Man, Mr. Lindsay
appears to mean Gregarious Man, who,
by a perfectly natural instinct, collects
in herds. But the artist, whom Mr. Lind-
say regards as the Abnormal Man, is just
as gregarious as his Normal Man. The
trouble arises through the artist having
a different conception of what is normal
from the Normal Man.
Mr. Lindsay says that animals which
live in flocks and herds drive out or kill
the weakly and sick or injured, know-
ing instinctively that their presence is
liable to draw upon the herd the atten-
tion of its enemies. He thinks that the
human animal does the same thing. He
says that the human animal carries the
process further with his reasoned know-
ledge and lays down laws which he does
his best to make all obey, and he cites
the Ten Commandments as the herd’s
fundamental code.
Now, this is just too beautiful, but it
doesn’t happen to be true. The herd for
whom Moses legislated did not invent
those laws. It had them forced upon it
by Moses, an exceptional man who knew
better than it did what was good
for it. If Moses had not been strong
enough to do this his herd would have
cast him out and gone on its own irra-
tional way to self-destruction, for the
human herd, although it has instincts
like the animals, has an intellect as well,
but uses it badly, and does not know who
are its real enemies and who its friends.
Moreover, when a Moses has forced his
reasoned notion of how it ought to be-
have on a herd, the herd does not fulfil
the law by a process of reasoning, but
blindly ; so that in course of time, when
the laws become out of date and down-
right dangerous to the safety of the herd,
it still follows them and slays or perse-
cutes or gags any new Moses who
happens to arise and offer it a better set
of laws. The Greek herd cast out
Socrates, but that did not prevent it
perishing in it's turn.
Mr. Lindsay’s Normal Man, in short,
is simply an individual who does what
he has been taught to do without any
thought at all, and who is quite incap-
able of understanding any but the most
immediate effects that' derive from the
things he does. In Germany he is being
prepared to destroy and be destroyed ,
in every other country the same. Shaw
said that it is the horrible things in life
which the normal man thinks are quite
right' and natural. Thus we have divorce
laws that are horrible and social customs
that are horrible and educational systems
that are horrible and an economic system
which is producing such horrible results
that even the Normal Man is beginning
to see that everything is not Quite Right,
though the Abnormal Man saw it aeons
ago. The individual whom Mr. Lindsay
is pleased to call the Abnormal Man is
simply one who has a sense of personal
responsibility as to what he does and
examines the laws and the customs and
the social codes and Nature and his in-
stinctive self and tries to order his life
by his understanding, even if his chosen
and dangerous way conflicts with the
ways that govern his unconscious herd.
This is all very kindergarten, but it
was Mr. Lindsay who started reciting
the alphabet—backwards, I’m afraid.
But when he assumes that it is the
Normal Man who keeps the Abnormal
Man in the path of virtue and prevents
him disregarding the feelings of others
and saves him from falling into a
“slough of bestiality and perversion” he
has become too foolish to be worth
further words.

Maoriland’s
Harvest
of Verse
In a foreword
to New Zealand
Best Poems of
19 34 (H. H.
Tombs, Welling-
ton, M.L. ; 2s.
6d.), editor C. A. Marris remarks that
there may be complaint that the collec-
tion is almost barren of “local color,”
and quotes Goethe to the effect that
purely national poetry can seldom be
great, lacking universal appeal.
Present commentator found enough of
the tang of the flax and the yellow fire
of the kowhai among these 33 short com-
positions to induce nostalgia, but not one
couplet even that bore the print of great-
ness. These Maoriland versifiers seem
to have more head than heart. They
imagine to themselves how someone
other than themselves would feel in cir-
cumstances of which they themselves
have had no experience, a tradi-
tion of artificiality that dates back to
Domett, whose. romantic chiefs and
wahines were as much like Maoris as
Watteau figurines on a mantelpiece.
The exceptions to the rule in the long
roll of poets down to the present day
are so few that they stick in the memory.
Poor Tom Bracken {not in his “Mis-
understood,” but his more frankly auto-
biographical pieces,- such as the lines
about booze that commence “Thou art
the foulest fiend of all”); Blanche Baug-
han, in her first flush of inspiration ;
Jessie Mackay, when she sang more art-
lessly than she does to-day ; Dick Harris,
in just a few of his middle-period verses
—these and a very few others wrote as
they felt and as life had taught them.
Eileen Duggan, who contributes four
pieces to the present volume, was better
when quite unsophisticated. She would
never then have penned the Rosetti-and-
water couplets that end cacophonically:
Lets no earthly king abash her,
King of Europe, King of Asia!
Outside the quiet philosophisings of
Arnold Wall, what takes the mind best
is a very clever essay in the Browning
manner—Robin Hyde’s “The English
Rider.” For the ear there is most music
in Jessie Mackay’s “Go No More
A-Sorrowing.”
A. D. W.
A Satchel of Books
The Myth of the Mystic East, by
Lieut.-Colonel Robert Henry Elliot
(Blackwood; 7s. 6d. net). Vigorous de-
bunking of sentimental misbeliefs con-
cerning the alleged rope trick and other
fancy conjuring of the East. Himself a
conjurer, the author slashes calmly into
the purely good conjuring tricks which
soft-minded tourists represent as major
mysteries. Good weight on the side of
anti-superstition.
Cauldron Bubble, by Leslie Reid (Gol-
lancz; Bs. 6d. English price). Lloyd
George “greatly enjoyed this very in-
teresting and powerful novel,” and its
publishers have “read nothing which
would be more likely to bring home to
the reading public what a new war would
actually mean.” In other words, “popu-
lar” fiction on the lines of Ruritania
reincarnated and bombarded. Lloyd
George’s library should be worth look-
ing at.
A Pageant of the Years, by James
Hume-Cook (The Ruskin Press, Melb.).
A booklet of verse to commemorate
Victoria’s centenary by a man who has
been better known as a M.L.A. and Pro-
tectionist than a poet. His verses,
imaginative, not narrative, have ring-
ing passages of Kiplingesque flavor.
My Confessional, by Havelock Ellis
(Bodley Head; 7s. 6d., English price).
Here is an eminent author who takes his
“fan” mail seriously enough to read it.
Dismissing all those foolish kind of
letters out of which Branch Cabell
recently made that diverting book
“Special Delivery,” Ellis provides almost
Havelock Ellis.
as engaging and
decidedly more
informative and
p r o v o c ative
reading by giv-
ing, in 70-odd
brief chapters,
the answers he
sent or might
have sent to the
more genuine of
his correspon-
dents those
seeking light on
eugenics, war,
birth control, bolshevism, nudism, music,
the young generation and several dozen
other topics in which Ellis’s writings had
led all these, mostly young, people to
assume that he would be interested.
Most of the letters are from America, but
the origin is scattered, and there is not
one from Australia. Australians are
notoriously reluctant letter-writers, but
the moral may not really be so compli-
mentary.
The insane and hopeless passion of
William Hazlitt for Sarah Walker is the
subject of Hesketh Pearson’s The Fool
of Love (Hamish Hamilton ; 10s 6d. net).
Unhappily married and living apart from
his wife, abnormally sensitive and ex-
ceedingly difficult to live with, Hazlitt, at
43, met his landlady’s daughter, Sarah,
and fell desperately in love with her.
To his face Sarah played simplicity and
innocence, but retailed his passionate
speeches below-stairs, and allowed other
lodgers to take liberties with her. Yet
for years Hazlitt was obsessed with this
passion, suffering mental torment and
boring his friends with his praises of the
girl. His death, at 52, was probably
hastened by the affair. In the early
chapters the author falls into the com-
mon error of trying to make his hero
stand out in bolder relief by maligning
others —in this instance Coleridge and
Wordsworth. It seems an unnecessary
sort of book.
Having Crossed the Channel, by X.
Marcel Boulestin (Heinemann ; 6s. net).
Fruits of a gastronomical motor tour,
with neither literary pretension nor
achievement; its chief point of interest,
other than that which it holds for gour-
mets or intending tourists, is the com-
ment it makes on how the tourist com-
merce is destroying the traditional gas-
tronomical character of France.
Detective Inspector
Silver reappears in
Henry Holt’s Murder
at the Bookstall (Crime
Club ; 7s. 6d.); so, un-
fortunately, does his
wisecracking reporter-
friend Andy Collinson.
The verbal interchanges
of the two, which re-
semble the witticisms
of cornermen in a
Christy Minstrel show,
occupy a good deal of
space to no particular
purpose; but it’s a
well-told yarn all the
same. Though the
corpse is found in a
Charing Cross railway
station bookstall, most
of the action takes
place in the English
country and in France.
A Choice of Verse:—
"DIED IN HARNESS."
At his des\ with its litter of papers the old man died;
And it seemed in the morning,
With its frolic of children in rhythms of blue and
gold,
The rattle of dishes, the bustle of men into offices,
A great bell tolled
Grow old . . . Grow old . . . We all grow old.
The scratch of a million pens, the clatter of typists'
hushed,
And in all the world that moment no man was
bought or sold.

AUSTRALIA AND MAORILAND.
A Couple of Maoriland Ministers have
come to Australia to discuss trade matters
with the Commonwealth Cabinet, and an
Australian Minister has gone to Maori-
land for conversations about defence.
Whatever this interchange of views may
lead to, each visit serves as a reminder
that the Dominions separated by the
Tasman have been made nearer neighbors
than ever before by the transport de-
velopments of this wonderful century.
A ’plane of the Comet or Douglas
type could easily take its passengers
from breakfast in Sydney and land them
in time for five-o’clock tea in Auckland
or Wellington. Within a year or two
there will be a regular air service between
the two countries, bringing the Long
White Cloud closer to the Eastern States
of the Commonwealth than Swanland.
Provision was made in the Constitution
Act for “the admission into the Com-
monwealth of other Australasian colo-
nies and possessions of the Queen.” The
Maorilanders have refused to avail them-
selves of it, and the chances are that
they never will. But this need not pre-
vent either nation from treating the other
as a member of the same family, with
common memories, interests and obliga-
tions. They were united in war in the
most human and sacred of partnerships,
and it assuredly never dawned on the
Diggers that they would drift apart as
they have done.
For many years the Maorilanders,
though their general sentiments towards
Australia have been as friendly as ever,
have felt that they are unjustly discrimi-
nated against in various departments of
trade. This feeling has expressed itself
in retaliatory measures and in a drift
of purchases to other countries, particu-
larly Canada. During the last decade, to
go no further back, Australia has re-
ceived for her exports to Maoriland
about two and a half times what she has
paid for imports from that source.
When this disparity is discussed in the
Dominion the opinion is usually ex-
pressed that the people and even the poli-
ticians of Australia are heartily in favor
of a fairer deal, but that whenever there
is a chance for the Maorilanders to turn
an honest penny bureaucratic experts
get in their fine work. Though both
countries engage in about the same sort
of farming, there are seasonal opportuni-
ties for trade in even farm produce. For
instance, recently potatoes were selling in
Sydney for £lB a ton. In Auckland the
quotation was £3 a ton, with buyers hard
to find. Australia will not take Maori-
land potatoes for fear of disease. She
finds a similar excuse for barring other
farm produce in times of scarcity on the
mainland. Protests are met with “proofs”
expressed in unintelligible language, and
reprisals are resorted to in a like spirit
and jargon. Not that Australia is the
worst offender in this regard. Uncle Sam
barred Maoriland butter because a
chemist in the Department of Agriculture
found .000009 of a grain of boric acid in
one pat.
Red-tape and finicky restrictive regu-
lations are out of place between relations
so near in all respects, and the sooner
they are cut out the better. There would
be greater opportunities for Australian
trade with Maoriland, and for Maoriland
trade with Australia, if the causes of
present discontents were removed;
though, of course, trade is not the only
matter to be considered. When world
emergencies occur the two Dominions
find themselves in the one boat. One
threat to their national existence has been
overcome, largely by the valor of their
sons, fighting side by side. Another may
arise, and if it finds them divided and un-
prepared, the consequences may be urn
pleasant for both.
HUGHES OF WESTRALIA.
A trusty watchdog is a useful posses-
sion, and the two-legged equivalent in
public affairs can be very serviceable
to a democracy. He need not be a mem-
ber of Parliament nor yet a journalist,
but he must have some taste for writing
or talking and some talent for ascertain-
ing and assembling facts and ramming
them home. Courage he needs, of
course, and a certain ruggedness of
mind: he must be pertinacious, repeti-
tive and insensitive to criticism —not
afraid of being voted a bore.
Those qualities are seldom combined
under the one hat, and many communi-
ties are without a watchdog. Westralia
has a good one in E. J. Hughes.
He was in the State Parliament once.
The Perth Trades Hall bosses took him
into their favor when they picked a
quarrel with the able J. J. Simons over
a matter unconnected with politics and
drove him to resign his seat. Hughes
won the by-election and became Labor
member for East Perth. But he cut no
noticeable figure in the Assembly, and
resigned after a term or two, returning
to his calling of accountant. He hadn’t
pleased the clique that ruled the Caucus,
and it hadn’t pleased him. The parting
was a relief to both, and his unfriendly
“comrades” told themselves they had
seen the last of him. They were to be
rudely undeceived.
A Nationalist Government set up a
Lotteries Commission with a Labor
M.L.C. as chairman and a Nationalist
M.L.A. as member, both receiving pay.
The Nationalist member went down in
the rout of his party at the polls ; the
ensuing Labor Government confirmed
the appointment of the Labor M.L.C. at
an addition to his Parliamentary salary
of £250 a year. It occurred to Hughes,
now taking a law course at Perth Uni-
versity, that this violated the salutary
provision against members of Parliament
holding offices of profit under the Crown.
He decided to challenge it, and took pro-
ceedings against the Labor M.L.C. at his
own expense ; and the Courts decided
that he was right.
The Labor Government rushed to the
rescue of the Labor M.L.C. Had it
cancelled the appointment and accepted
financial responsibility for acts to
which it and the previous Government
had been parties—substantial penalties
against the Labor M.L.C. were awarded
to Hughes—nothing much would have
been said. Instead, it brought in a Con-
stitution Act Amendment Bill permitting
the Labor M.L.C. to go on holding the
lotteries job and indemnifying him
against all consequences, past, present
and future. “This,” it gleefully thought,
“will settle the hash of Mr. Hughes” ;
but it didn’t'. That gentleman, studying
the iniquitous measure, which had been
drafted and passed in a hurry, found a
flaw in it, as it seemed to him.
He carried the matter to the Supreme
Court, which decided in his favor. An
appeal against its judgment was dis-
missed by the State Full Court; in effect,
both Courts ruled that the Act was defec-
tive on the point of indemnification
against past proceedings, and that the
Labor M.L.C. was still bound to pay the
penalties awarded to Hughes. Leave to
appeal to the High Court was granted,
and after many months the judgments
of the State Courts were upset. It is
useless to indulge in speculation as to
which set of Judges was right; what the
High Court says in these matters goes.
In the meantime, Hughes stood for
one of the Fremantle seats in the Leg.
Council and was defeated. During the
campaign a scurrilous pamphlet was
issued against him by his Labor enemies.
The State electoral law takes a serious
view of charges made against a candi-
date in circumstances rendering it diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for him to dis-
prove them by polling-day; and Hughes
bided his time. Presently he struck at
a Trades Hall worthy, and got the gentle-
man substantially fined.
For another Labor M.L.C. who was
concerned in the publication of the
pamphlet a more leisurely process was
reserved. It was pleaded on behalf of
this M.L.C. that *if a conviction were
recorded he would lose his seat and be
disqualified from standing again for a
term of years. The magistrate replied
that he could not help that; the defen-
dant was presumed to know the law, and
had committed a flagrant breach of it.
A fine was inflicted, and apparently no-
thing remained but for the Government
to declare the seat forfeit. Again it
showed itself ready to violate custom
and precedent to save a “comrade.”
Without reference to Parliament it had
the offender “pardoned” by the Lieu-
tenant-Governor.
The Opposition, in the Leg. Assembly
and a majority of the Leg. Councillors
protested against this outrage. Hughes’s
own comments were racy and pertinent,
and he improved the occasion by recover-
ing Supreme Court damages from the
authors and printers of the pamphlet.
Last week he took proceedings against
Acting-Premier McCallum, who denied
having helped to compile the thing,
though he admitted having suggested the
title. In support of his case the un-
wearied reformer called several “Han-
sard” reporters to testify to what McCal-
lum had said about the matter in Par-
liament ; under instructions they refused
to give evidence. Incidentally, in this
affair and others —notably the career of
a manganese company, in which cer-
tain politicians were interested and which
received large concessions from a past
Government—Hughes has always at-
tacked in the open. Except in the case
of the election pamphlet his Labor foes
have assailed him —sometimes in slan-
derous terms —under cover of privilege.
Other States could do with sturdy
citizens like Hughes. Such men are
sorely needed for the struggle which
will have to be waged—the South. Aus.
Law Society is beginning it —against
Government by regulation. They would
make things unhealthy for the impudent
jacks-in-office who are springing up
everywhere, particularly the petty tyrants
of transport and taxation. Hughes has
given us an example of what
one resolute man can do in a good cause.
Contending single-handed against an
arrogant Government controlling three-
fifths of the votes in the popular
Chamber, he has directed against it such
a concentration of disgust that its days
are numbered. It is saved from imme-
diate disaster only by the Constitution it
has flouted.
SYDNEY’S GOLDEN JEST.
The N. S. Wales Government has had a
Charitable Collections Bill on the stocks
for upwards of a year. “A bill to pro-
vide for the regulation of collections for
charitable purposes, for the keeping and
audit of accounts relating to such col-
lections,” and “for the registration of
charities.” According to report it will
be dumped on the Statute Book before
the Government goes to the country. If
passed in its present form, it will regu-
late some charities, after a fashion, and
let others go unregulated.
Section 3 says:
It shall not be lawful for any person to
make an appeal for the support of charity
unless the appeal is registered under this
Act or exempted.
The list of exemptions stretches almost
to the crack of doom. It includes lottery
organisers, ambulance collectors, the Hos-
pital Saturday Fund, eleemosynary ap-
peals at public meetings, “any collection
made with the approval of the Hos-
pitals Commission” and “persons con-
cerned in any collection for any hospital
,or institution mentioned in the schedules
of the Public Hospitals Act 1901-29
where the collection is made with the
sanction of the board.” Also any
other person or charity whom the Min-
ister chooses to name.
The Langton Clinic is on the exemp-
tion list. According to a 1932-33 balance
sheet, £BO3 was raised for the Langton
Clinic by means of an “art union” which
cost £3845 to run. And the £BO3, plus
£4l, was spent on advertising, “stamps,
stationery, etc.” Patients and the Gov-
ernment found all other expenses of
keeping the Langton Clinic in being.
St. Margaret’s Hospital, an. allied in-
stitution, showed in the last balance
sheet produced' to The Bulletin:
Subscriptions and Donations £4439 15 0
From Patients 2426 15 0
£6866 10 0
Inquiry elicited the information that
£lO3 represented subscriptions and dona-
tions, and £336-odd interest on mort-
gages, £4OOO in a solid lump having
come from “proceeds of entertainments,
‘art unions,’ etc., as per special com-
mittee.” These were not itemised in the
reports, and the special committee was
not named.
St. Margaret’s is to be exempt from
regulation under the Charitable Collec-
tions Bill. So is Dalwood Home, which
belongs to the same string. Dalwood
Home is “For the Babies.” Its last
report (1933) includes an income-and-
expenditure account which gives the fol-
lowing details:
Expenditure £2406 17 5
By Food for Babies Fund,
including £350 received
from the Hospitals Commis-
sion •.. 2372 9 7
Deficit £34 7 10
In another part of the report appears
on a decorated page (opposite an expen-
sive and affecting illustration of a child
praying) the heading “Donations to the
Dalwood Health Home.” Not totalled
in the document, they add up to £4456
19s. —nearly twice as much as the amount
shown as income in the income-and-
expenditure account.
The expenditure includes salaries and
wages, £7Ol 10s. Advertising and pub-
licity and stationery and stamps came to
only £27 15s. On the face of it, the
balance sheet cost that if it cost a penny.
However, this institution’s collections
apparently need no more intensive regu-
lation. About the time the bill was
drafted “The Honorable B. S. B. Stevens,
M.L.A.,” was described as Chief Patron.
The fact is that the Langton Clinic,
St. Margaret’s, Dalwood Home and the
Food for Babies Fund are nourished by
the “art unions” known as the Golden
Jest. Of such lotteries, Messrs. Smith
and Johnson, accountants, have written:
While the character of these ‘art unions’
remains as at present, the collection of
moneys from the public by such means
is to be deplored.... Success is due to the
almost unbelievable credulity of the pub-
lic. The prizes are altogether dispropor-
tionate to the total collections, due to the
expenses incurred being necessarily heavy.
~..In the ‘art union’ under review, the
percentage of net to gross return was
21 per cent.
Some of the literature of a Golden
Jest “art union” has been sent back by
a Bulletin subscriber in Hong Kong.
He says it “doesn’t help Australia’s repu-
tation.” The budget includes a letter
from an “honorary director” who is re-
ported to have made whips of money by
selling shares in Government lottery
tickets —a business under sentence of
death, though sentence has been sus-
pended indefinitely—together with pic-
tures of the Sydney Town Hall (“where
the lottery will be drawn”) and Scottish
House (“Home of the Golden Box”). It
encloses expensively-printed vouchers for
shilling tickets, which can be had whole-
sale 14 to the dozen in the form of
Christmas cards. (“Each one a pretty
Australian scene. They’re colored, too.
You’ll like them.”) No, “it doesn’t help
Australia’s reputation,” but the enterprise
issuing the beguiling stuff is to go on
being privileged under the law. It is to
be exempt from registration and placed
in a position where it can be regu-
lated only after an appeal to the Supreme
Court.
There is some talk of the bill being
altered. It should be scrapped. The
Postmaster-General has power to crush
private lotteries by not delivering their
mail. He winks the other eye. The
Attorney-General has power to regulate
“art unions” or prohibit them altogether.
In the face of d flood of undesirable
practices he takes no action. Without
any new legislation glaring abuses could
be wiped out. But if a Charities Bill is
to be introduced, it should not be one
which looks as if it had been drafted
by the Golden Jest itself.
TAXATION NO REMEDY.
The democratic world has entered on an
era of political bribery. Thus in N. S.
Wales an anti-Socialist Government is
busy with plans for freeing municipal
councils and farmers from part of their
debts, and for helping “purchasers of
homes in difficulties” to pay their instal-
ments. In plain English, the N. S. Wales
Government proposes to make itself what
is known as a good fellow among neces-
sitous electors with the money of those
from whom further taxes can be ex-
tracted.
The British Labor party, whose return
to office is expected, has a Five-Year-Plan,
prepared for it by Sir Stafford Cripps
and Sir Charles Trevelyan. Progressive
reduction of working hours, progres-
sive increases in pensions and standard
wages for non-workers are features, and
the funds are to be acquired by “increas-
ing income tax, surtax and death duties”
and by transferring Defence expenditure
to social services.
President Roosevelt has been setting
the pace for the popularity-seeking poli-
ticians of the world. In an effort to
outdistance him the Democratic rulers
of Louisiana have introduced “one of
the most sensational pieces of economic
legislation ever enacted”—a provision for
an indefinite moratorium on every class
of debt. Louisiana, however, lacks the
resources at the disposal of the Roose-
velt Administration, which is paying
$95,000,000 a month in unemployment
relief alone. It is reported to have put
between 600,000 and 700,000 New
Dealers on the U.S. Government
payrolls. Yet, according to the presi-
dent of the American Federation of
Labor, which is pro-Roosevelt, “more
men are unemployed in the U.S.A. than
a year ago. May it not be a case of
cause and effect?
The phenomenon of 30,000,000 un-
employed workers has coincided in


every civilised country with the phe-
nomenon of professional politicians,
nine-tenths of whom have no qualifica-
tions for being where they are but a
capacity to bamboozle voters. With the
widenings of the suffrage that have taken
place almost everywhere in the past
quarter of a century more and more
workers’ representatives have become
Parliamentarians, and the economic lot
of all but the close aristocracies of labor
has got steadily worse. So has the eco-
nomic lot of nearly all the classes that
pay most of the taxes. A Royal Commis-
sion found the other day that the wheat-
farmers of Australia owe £140,000,000 ;
and the plight of most of the sheep-
farmers is probably little better.
The main problem which nations
have to face is essentially one for
specialists: more money has been bor-
rowed than there is in the world, and
the overdraft is being increased by every
democratic Government that attains
office. Governments have no difficulty
in adding to the overdraft because in
every Parliament there is a preponder-
ance of members who live politically by
going one better than their opponents as
spenders.
In the Parliaments of Australia for
the past 20 years there have been plenty
of lawyers, as a rule, but scarcely any
doctors, architects, engineers or bankers;
plenty of trade-union officials, but few
creators or controllers of great stores or
industries, few successful farmers or
graziers. It isn’t that these men would
not put their talents and experience at the
service of their fellow-citizens if they
could ; they have no chance against the
professional spruikers and promisers.
If Australia is to be saved from
the second innings of the depres-
sion which the U.S.A. has Had, and from
the bankruptcy to which it seems to be
drifting, Australia will need more enlight-
ened and responsible rulers. It will have
to get representative manufacturers, com-
mercial men and so on into its Parlia-
ments. But in order to get them it will
need to alter the status of the franchise.
Our Parliaments are elected in part
by the kind of people whom Huxley
has called “mental Peter Pans.” They
don’t want the vote ; they never have
wanted it. Until compulsory voting
was introduced in the Commonwealth
polls were often as low as 50 p.c.
of the electors, and sometimes lower.
In Canberra last week at a meet-
ing called to demand Parliamentary
representation for the F.C.T. “only about
50 persons attended.” Plainly what this
country needs to be financially saved is
not universal suffrage, with penalties for
those who don’t exercise it, but some de-
vice that will make the act of voting a
solemn rite, reserved as the nation’s re-
ward for proven patriots (e.g., returned
soldiers with good service records) and

EX-DEMOS.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Golden Way Out.
The Commonwealth Government has
become interested in Dr. Rivett’s sugges-
tion that Australia should go in for gold
production on a much more extensive
scale, summoning science to its aid and
abandoning the notion that State aid to
prospecting should begin and end with
sending men out somewhere with picks,
waterbags and orders for groceries. All
going well, the thing is to be discussed
at a conference of State Ministers of
Mines and their principal advisers, to
be held at Melbourne the first week in
December.
Out of nothing nothing comes, and it
is the same with conferences, as a rule.
Possibly this one will be different. Mr.
Stewart, now styled “Under-Secretary for
Re-employment,” is to be present on
behalf of his Government. He is an
accepted authority on Sydney motor-’bus
transport, but of goldmining and the
auriferous resources of Australia he
knows no more than the next man. The
delegates will listen with vastly greater
interest to Dr. Rivett, who, no doubt,
will be asked to attend and develop his
ideas. Even if he were not the projector,
he would have a right to be present on
behalf of the C.S. and I.R.
Gold is the one Australian commo-
dity which is sure of an overseas market
at a highly profitable price. By organ-
ised natiofi-wide effort, our Australian
scientist thinks, we could locate and
mine enough of it to pay off our overseas
debt. Even if this is impracticable, a
great many men and youths now idle or
casually employed on relief jobs that pro-
duce nothing but the seeds of future
taxes could be mobilised in the search
for it, and in the exploitation of known
ore-bodies. And in the process of ex-
panding the goldmining industry a fillip
would be given to allied industries and
trades —incidentally, very good mining
machinery is made in Australia.
Government mining ventures have had
no happy history, but in districts, new
or old, which admit of operations on a
large scale the establishment of com-
panies on the model of Amalgamated
Wireless, in which the Government has
a controlling interest (though it rightly
chooses not to exercise it), might
be considered. Apart from the ques-
tion of the overseas debt, the Com-
monwealth will sooner or later have
to start building up another gold reserve.
Meanwhile State Governments, particu-
larly those of Westralia and Queensland,
might well be asked to enforce Mining
Act conditions on leases held by specu-
lators who do all their mining in the
market, and to refuse transfers of aban-
doned leases known to contain gold to
men of straw.

Where Were the Diggers?
“El V.”: I saw the royal procession in
Sydney from a tall building in Mac-
quarie-street. The setting was superb.
The world has nothing better to show
than that scene with its tracery of bays
studded with anchored craft, its scurry-
ing ferries and motor-boats, its sweep of
ordered gardens and its dignified old
Government House.
And it can produce nothing better than
the escort which rode with the Duke —
well-mounted, well-drilled and riding
in style which would not have disgraced
any of the great horse regiments of
Europe, inured and trained to regular
ceremonial.
But why were there not more of
them? Surely such an occasion called
for a march of Diggers. Ten thousand
Anzacs tramping would have meant a
thousand times more than the industrial
floats with their reclining girls and imi-
tation flowers and weary school-children
in sashes who struggle haltingly through
the streets on these occasions.
Somebody remarked that the crowds
were undemonstrative. They did not
cheer like English crowds. But if a few
of the old battalions had appeared with
colors up, and if a smart battalion of
regulars and a crack marching detach-
ment of naval men had gone down the
street, the housetops would have been
shaken.
The authorities are altogether too
frightened of- offending extreme voters
by giving the Digger his proper place in
public life. He is the exhibit by which
Australia is best known to the world,
yet there is a strong tendency growing
up to teach his sons that the causes for
which he risked his life were unworthy
and that instead of fighting to keep
Australia a British country with a free
Constitution he was merely the dupe of
scoundrels and profiteers. They taught
the same sort of thing in decadent
Rome—till the Goths and the Vandals
arrived.

Only a Gent.!
“Whitehall” on a delicate “subject:
Gladstone once said that the hardest thing
to define was a gentleman. Birth, upbringing,
race have nothing to do with it, and many
of the requisite qualities are negative. There
was the case of the Spanish cardinal who re-
buked a young grandee for levity during an
auto-da-fe. “But you burned the heretic,
Eminence!” “Yes, my son; burned him like
a gentleman—seriously, respectfully.”
A gentleman isn’t necessarily virtuous, sober
or otherwise righteous, and it doesn’t signify
what religious or political creed he professes,
or if he professes none. The chance to prove
himself only comes once in a blue moon; but
his response is instantly recognised by people
of all classes, and it is capable of arousing
almost as much enthusiasm in the human heart
as a great deed of valor.
Herr Kisch had a chance in a million in
Sydney last week. He was asked by a member
to the Fellowship of Writers’ luncheon in
honor of Masefield. It put the chief guest in
a false position as Laureate. Also two Federal
Ministers who have been trying to get Kisch
excluded as an undesirable alien. Masefield
couldn’t refuse to attend in the circumstances;
the Ministers did (likewise Premier Stevens),
and so much unpleasantness was caused in the
fellowship that the inviter of Herr Kisch sent
in his resignation.
Herr Kisch might have written to the fel-
lowship in this strain,:
“I realise that my presence at your lunch
will cause dissension. I am a pacifist.
Rather than foment strife and ill-feeling I
will forego the pleasure of doing honor to
a BritislTCourt official. My critics say that
I am a trouble-maker, and that my trucu-
lent methods have caused me to be kicked
out of my own country. Here is my
answer.”
Instead, he insisted on going to the lunch,
and, on finding that he was not to sit with
the ’Laureate, he said, according to the “Tele-
graph”:—
* “Is this not a slur? Am I not at an
inferior table? Why am I not seated at
the Number One table?”
And, according to the “Labor Daily”:
“I have not met any of the people of
the first table. I did not come here to
meet just the ordinary type, but to meet
Mr. Masefield and other high men to
whom I was not introduced.”
Not a pacifist. Above all, not a gentleman.
Only a gent.
Sackcloth and Ashes Needed.
The soft-heartedness of politicians works
in wondrous ways. The Caledon Bay
native Tuckiar, who admitted having
killed a policeman, has been released be-
cause the High Court did not think the
Darwin Judge’s summing-up was full
enough and because he drew some tech-
nically wrong inferences for the jury.
Immediately Mr. Brennan, M.H.R. for
Batman, asked the Attorney-General
whether he would “take steps to prevent
further public danger in other criminal
trials before the Judge mentioned.” And
Mr. Stewart, formerly Minister for Com-
merce, who might know an aboriginal
if he saw one, remarked:
It is to be hoped you haven’t got many
Judges like him.
An unworthy sneer. Thrice unworthy
since it was uttered by a member of
the Government that first muddled the
Caledon Bay business, then sent inexperi-
enced policemen to the district where
one of them was killed, then pushed its
responsibility for capturing the culprits
on two missionaries, and finally re-
sponded to the clamor of old ladies and
international defence associations by
altering the law and making the death
sentence optional for murder —a respon-
sibility which should never have been
imposed on the Judge.
Admittedly, murders by savages are in
a different category from those com-
mitted by people with a knowledge of
the criminal code. But most of the slay-
ings which now occupy almost the whole
of the time of the Darwin Court could
be prevented by efficient administration,
free from interference by city politicians.
The pity lavished on Tuckiar, who seems
well able to look after himself, might
be spared for the young widow whose
life he blighted when he speared her
husband. The indignation hurled at the
Judge might also be diverted. No
Minister of the last Lyons Cabinet should
ever speak of northern native administra-
tion except in sackcloth and with ashes
on his head.

“You Can’t Kill Santa Claus.”
This bright American discovery has not
been overlooked in Tasmania. Mr. Cos-
grove, the Labor Minister of Agricul-
ture, is sending along a personal letter
with each fruitgrower’s-relief cheque;
it runs as follows:
The Government realises the very diffi-
cult times through which the fruit industry
is passing, and has left nothing undone to
expedite the payments to fruitgrowers
under this legislation.
It is hoped that this measure of relief,
although small, will assist you to carry on
fruitgrowing, an industry which means so
much to Tasmania. I trust that the prices
for the coming season will be more re-
munerative than they have been for the
past few seasons.
The Fruitgrowers’ Relief Act is a Com-
monwealth measure, and the Common-
wealth is providing all the money. But
in Mr. Cosgrove’s representation of Santa
Claus it doesn’t even figure as the rein-
deer.

The Stunter and the Law.
In Victor Hugo’s “Ninety-Three” a
Royalist sailor carelessly lets a gun
escape from its moorings during a heavy
sea. With great courage and intelli-
gence he secures it again. The old
Chouan in control pins a decoration on
the hero’s chest—and has him shot.
Australia might well adopt the prin-
ciple, while choosing another form of
punishment, in dealing with cases like
those of the youngsters Nicholl and
Whitehead, who made the Tasman
flight in a ’plane which all competent
authorities had pronounced unfit for the
task. The courage of the two lads is
something to win the admiration of all;
their folly something to be stamped out
ruthlessly.
Nicholl and Whitehead defied the
Commonwealth’s Civil Aviation Depart-
ment, which had suspended the registra-
tion of the ’plane and its certificate of
airworthiness. They were in much the
same position as the motorist who re-
fuses to obey the signal of the traffic
cop, except that their offence was
ranker. In their heroic folly they
gambled not only with their own lives
but with the lives of other airmen who
might have been sent out to search for
them ; gambled also with public opinion.
Aviation has suffered severe blows of
late. Had Nicholl and Whitehead
crashed it would have sustained an-
other serious setback. If it is to
take the place it should take in the De-
fence and transport services of the Com-
monwealth, foolhardy stunts of this
type must be stamped out without
mercy. For that, adequate Common-
wealth powers are needed, and the State
Parliaments should grant them. State
rights are not involved in the matter;
the public safety is.
The “Poor Clerk.”
There is nothing so touching in a poli-
tical or an uplift speech as a reference
to the “poor clerk.” It is sure-fire stuff.
Even the correspondence schools adver-
tise “Why be a poor clerk all your life
when you can learn snake-charming in
six lessons?”
The extended sympathy may not be
wasted. There are few things more piti-
ful than the honest, hard-working, intelli-
gent man who remains a lifelong clerk
on the basic wage ; but every poor clerk
carries a millionaire’s cheque-book in
his knapsack.
A few years back, when money was
money, an investigation into income-tax
matters revealed the fact that there were
12 actual millionaires in Australia —that
is, 12 men who paid taxation on incomes
capitalised at a million pounds. One
of that opulent dozen had started life
as a marine steward; all of the re-
maining 11 had been poor clerks when
they commenced to earn their own liv-
ings. Not only had they been clerks, but
they had remained clerks—foreman
clerks, boss clerks and owner clerks.
Putting millionaires aside, a glance
over a list of the wealthy—such as have
not inherited wealth or the means of
wealth—will show that nearly every one
of the wealthy and the vast majority of
the well-to-do rose from clerkship.
Many are called to clerkship and few are
chosen to millionairedom, but the prizes
are far bigger, if the chances are remote.
The man who struggles to send his son
to a university to qualify for a profes-
sion is unwittingly making him a finan-
cial mediocrity ; the man who lets his
boy become a poor clerk may live to see
him cleaning his teeth with champagne.
The most able and popular barrister
or surgeon in the Commonwealth makes
perhaps in good times £lO,OOO a year,
and he has to work like a nigger to do
it. The leading businessman regards
£lO,OOO a year as something within the
reach of all businessmen with sufficient
acumen. There are many professional
men, doctors, lawyers, engineers, scien-
tists, who have never cleared £lOOO a
year. There are few city shopkeepers
who haven’t done better than that.

What Is the R.1.L.U.?
It is just as well that Australian trade-
unionists should know exactly what sort
of doctrines they are financing when they
allow their unions to join bodies like the
Red International and the Minority
Movement.
The Red International, as defined by
the world congress which constituted it
in 1921, is a body which “unites the re-
volutionary labor organisations of all
countries.” Russia had four members on
the Central Executive from the start,
other countries one or two according to
membership.
Here are the main objectives for which
this pleasant body was designed:
(1) To organise the large working mass
of the whole world for the overthrow of
capitalism, the emancipation of toilers
from oppression and exploitation and the
establishment of the socialist common-
wealth.
(2) To carry on a wide agitation and
propaganda of principles of revolutionary
class struggle, social revolution, the dictator-
ship of the proletariat and revolutionary
mass action for the purpose of overthrow-
ing the capitalist system and the bourgeois
state.
(3) To fight against the corruptive ulcer
gnawing at the vitals of the world labor
movement, of compromising with the
bourgeoisie, against the ideas of class co-
operation and social peace and the absurd
hopes for a peaceable transition from
capitalism to socialism.
One of the membership conditions is:
(4) Recognition and submission to inter-
national proletarian discipline.
Another is:
(7) United action with all revolutionary
organisations and the Communist party of
the country in all defensive and offensive
activities against the bourgeoisie.
Under Section X of its constitution the
R.I.L.U. sets out its intention “to estab-
lish close and unbreakable connections
between the R.I.L.U. and the Third Com-
munist International Central Council,” to
the executive of which it was allowed to
send three representatives.
The Australian Minority Movement
pamphlet calls the White Australia doc-
trine a “deceptive anti-working class
policy designed to foster racial hatred of
our class brothers in the Pacific in the
hope that they [capitalists] can continue
to exploit and rob us.” It adds:
The capitalists know that if all workers
fight together, regardless of race, color or
creed, we will defeat them.
“To cripple the war machine of the
Australian capitalist class by preparing
for strike action in war industries and in
transport” is one of the things to which
these Red organisations aspire. And of
course they take a leading part in con-
gresses “against war.”

"AMD IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“J.H.M.A.”: One of the quaint things
about the Royal Navy and the R.A.N.—
at least, it seems quaint in an easy-going
country—is their punctuality. H.M.S.
Sussex, bearing the Duke of Gloucester,
passed by South the precise time
—8.30 a.m. —when she was due to
do so. When the Duke’s eldest
brother came here in H.M.S. Renown
she was olf Ben Buckler exactly when
she was expected to be there,
and when H.M.S. Hood ar-
rived she kept her timetable,
too.
“El V.”: I was aboard the
Hood when she came into
Sydney Harbor 10 years ago.
The wardroom viewed the
cliffs with complete detach-
ment and then retired to
breakfast. For a few mo-
ments there was no sound
save that of munched toast
from behind the magazines
propped up against marma-
lade jars. Entered a gloomy
and very junior “loot,” who re-
marked as his glance roamed in search
of his servant: “We’re goin’ in at 12
knots. I bet old B. [the navigator] will
be sweatin’ blood.” A dozen eyes glared
to reprove him for his breach of the
etiquette of morning silence. How dif-
ferently the Sussex crowd behaved,
according to a Sydney daily:
“Good lord, it’s—people! ” suddenly ex-
claimed a signalman, telescope to eye. “It’s
people!” one said, then another . . . Ex-
citement quickened: The Bridge . . .
Cries of admiration went up from those
on board. The Prince stood as if spell-
bound.
They must have developed a new tech-
nique since my time.
“Ike Hollar”: A good indicator of the
improvement in industrial conditions may
be found in the N.S.W. Education De-
partment’s resignations, which are be-
ginning to resume normal proportions.
During the depression the teachers, in
spite of salary cuts, hung so tenaciously
to their jobs that students who had quali-
fied for appointment could not find it.
In ordinary times women teachers,
especially after an exile in the bush, get
married if they is, if the young
man is in a position to marry. The in-
crease of resignations is a sign that jobs
are offering and prospective husbands
have found a more secure financial foot-
ing.

“G.M.”: The Star Theatre, Bourke-
street, Melbourne, is in the hands of
wreckers and commercial premises are to
go up instead. This is the place whence
F. T. Thring made his first rise ; pre-
viously it was Kreitmeyer’s waxworks.
Kreitmeyer was a Bavarian scientist
who drifted into showmanship by acci-
dent and finding it payable stayed there.
He was originally a partner with Dr. L.
L. Smith, father of the ex-Lord Mayor,
in Cremorne Gardens. Three or four
generations of Victorians have shud-
dered their way through Kreitmeyer’s
fearsome lines of homicides and, at one
time, no visitor from the bush ever con-
sidered he’d been to Melbourne unless he
had taken in a visit to the waxworks.
When Kreitmeyer died his widow and
daughter carried on the business until
Thring came in to rent the ground floor
for a continuous picture-show. Thring
later married Miss Kreitmeyer.

“W. 8.”: I rise to support Montague
Grover’s statement (B. 14/11/’34) that
grand opera is always bad art, mainly
tuneless and generally ridiculous. One
wonders how many of the regular “fans”
attend because they enjoy it. Not long
ago at a symphony concert I sat next to
the most passionate music-lover of my
acquaintance. As the orchestra was
tuning up, a bevy of near-society folk
sailed opulently into the priciest seats.
“Look,” said my companion, “at the best
people coming to endure the concert!”

“Millie Soak”: Octogenarian Jimmy
Thomson, who died a few weeks ago in
Fremantle, had his up and downs ; but I
doubt if he ever found journalism so re-
“Now, gentlemen, as man to man’
munerative a trade as when he migrated
to Westralia in 1894, wearing the honor
of having been gaoled on Melbourne
“Standard” thick upon him. Jimmy’s
luck held, a person who had pegged
out the first newspaper claim on
the Murchison —indeed, on the whole
goldfields—having just been jugged for
dishonesty as a postmaster. It was
one of Jimmy’s comps, who gave me my
first glimpse of those halcyon days.
“ ’Strewth!” he said, wiping the froth of
one of Jim Maloney’s beers meditatively
off his upper lip, “the old man was on a
good wicket then. Whenever the fore-
man went to him for copy, he’d grab
the office scissors and slash a chunk out
o’ the ‘Government Gazette.’ ‘Set that,’
he useter say, ‘and space it out.’ ” The
Forrest Government had plenty of money
and few friends, so it didn’t niggle about
advertisement expenses.

“J.8.J.”: Marble Bar (Westralia) can
fairly claim the record for the highest
average shade temperatures in the Com-
monwealth. Its tally is 106 consecutive
days of 100 degrees and over from Nov.
9, 1921, to Feb. 22, 1922. During that
period there were 81 consecutive days
when temperatures of 105 degrees and
over were recorded. The average maxi-
mum shade temperatures extending over
a period of years for the hottest months
of the year are: Nov., 105.5 deg. ; Dec.,
107.1 ; Jan., 107.1 ; Feb., 105.3 ; March,
103.5. There have been many readings
of 115 degrees and over, the highest
being 120.5 degrees in Jan., 1922. The
highest reading for the State, however, is
held by Eucla, which registered 123.2 deg.
in 1906. All these readings were re-
corded under the Stevenson screen, the
standard used by all weather bureaus in
the Commonwealth.

“Next, Please”: There is a lot of talk
about the order of precedence in the
Federal Cabinet; if Lyons and Page
were temporarily incapacitated would
Pearce or Parkhill or Menzies step into
the vacant place? In the old days it
was the moment when a Minister was
sworn in—“kissed hands,” as the phrase
went —which determined his seniority;
and even that wasn’t always settled be-
forehand. When Westralia’s second
Leake Government was formed in 1902,
a story was published of the Premier
shouldering aside Illingworth, his pre-
vious first-lieutenant, who was com-
placently presenting himself to be sworn
in, and intimating that Walter Kingsmill
was in future to stand next to himself.
Kingsmill retained that position until
Leake died, but after that it didn’t do
him any good, for Walter James came
along with an Aut Ccesar ant nullus atti-
tude and secured control of the show.

“Hamer”: The Liverpool (N.S.W.)
State Hospital, where 93-year-old Johnny
Wallace, doyen of the Australian stage,
died the other day, has sheltered
many another man of note in his
closing years. Dan O’Connor, the
State’s most picturesque Minister of
the Crown, finished up there, wearing
his top hat and frock coat, rather frayed
at the end, to the last. To-day it houses
ex-Ms.L.A., barristers, doctors, journal-
ists, musicians and a few who made—
but lost —wealth in commerce, besides
racing and mining men who once spoke
casually of thousands. A couple of
years ago one of the inmates was a pros-
pector who cleared £30,000 as the result
of a lucky find, but spent it as lightly as
it came.

“Selma”: The 10-year-old damsel from
next door attended a youngsters’ shivoo.
“Was it a nice party, darling?” inquired
mother on her return. Daughter as-
sumed an air of intense boredom:
“Awfully dull,” she pronounced, “and
anyway I’m fed up with these Mae West
stories! ”

“Mako”: We had decided to make a
local collection for Christmas cheer for
our backblocks M.L. hospital, and sent
out a call for helpers. Henare, who was
temporarily disengaged, offered his ser-
vices, and being a reputable citizen
was accepted. He made his first
call at the home of two elderly
and well-off maiden ladies who could
usually be relied on to give gener-
ous help in a worthy cause. When
Henare returned from them empty-handed
we thought an explanation was called for.
“Werra,” said our collector, “I ko up and
knock at te door, and nopody come. Ten
I rook in te window and tere t’ey are,
praying on same piano. Too poor to
give any money, I think.” We tried to
impress on Henare that when these par-
ticular old ladies were young a form of
torture known as a pianoforte duet was
popular, and sent him out again. A
cheque for a tenner was the result, but
Henare is still dubious over the two
performers on the one instrument.

“Hanover Jack”: Counterfeit silver
isn’t as plentiful as it was in Sydney two
or three years ago, but it is still about.
So much so that a well-known cleric
thought the “Problem of the Bad Florin”
and what should be done with it
worth some pulpit remarks. His practice
it seems, is to throw it into the harbor .
by passing on worthless money you be-
come a cheat yourself. True enough,
but nine-tenths of the people who
send bad money on further travels
have no idea that it is worthless ;
it isn’t till it encounters the sen-
sitive fingers of a barmaid or a tram
conductor or a bank officer that they are
disillusioned. The preacher went on to
recall that, when he was a boy in Devon-
shire, he used to see counterfeit coins
nailed to the counter in the village shop
—much on the same principle, one sup-
poses, as that which impels gamekeepers
to nail up carcasses of stoats and weasels
on barn doors. Still, if bogus florins
had been as common in Devon as
they have been in Sydney these last
few years, the counters of village shops
would have had to be enlarged to pil-
lory a fraction of them.

“Cosmos”: Herr Kisch is the luckiest
agitator that ever visited Australia. Local
upheavalists agree that as a personality
and speaker he has been a flop: the 11
languages in which he claims to be articu-
late don’t include English, and he looks
more like a prosperous bookie than a
political martyr. But he began with the
advantage of being barred by the Com-
monwealth Government—the publicity
equivalent of a jewel robbery in the case
of a stage star. Then he broke a leg,
which enabled him to cut a pathetic
though fleshy figure in the arms of
admirers. Young Osmond Esmonde was
refused permission to land after the war ;
Hughes suspected him of Sinn Feinism.
It brought sympathetic crowds to his
ship who wouldn’t otherwise have gone
near him. As proof of the multitude’s
blank indifference to most revolutionaries
qua revolutionaries, Karl Marx battled
against capitalism for half a lifetime in
Soho, and barely a dozen Britons knew
he was doing it. If the Government had
tried to censor “Das Kapital,” or so much
as confiscated the author’s top-hat or for-
cibly cut off his whiskers, an army of
scandalised Englishmen and -women
would have rallied round the alien immi-
grant.
“M.G.”: Egon Kisch’s failure to write
40 words of Gaelic from dictation raises
the question whether anybody could do
it. It is almost impossible to secure any
judgment on the language to use as a
standard. When General Hector Mac-
donald visited Australia the Vic.
Assembly gave him a luncheon and
plastered the walls of the dining-hall
with complimentary remarks in Gaelic,
compiled by one Duncan McGregor,
wine merchant and reputed authority on
the language. No sooner were the clans
assembled than a dozen voices were
heard demanding the name of the mis-
creant who had taken such liberties with
their noble tongue. It was in vain that
well-meaning Sassenachs sought to calm
the turmoil; after a few minutes of fierce
general denunciation of the McGregor
the protesters turned on one another, and
charges of ignorance flew about the
room. No two Hielanders seemed to
agree as to what real Gaelic was, so the
Assembly let the posters stand and
chanced it.

“Freud’s Offsider” propounds a theory:
One Archer Whitford, of Sydney, is the first
to introduce Mae West to municipal politics.
A candidate for the Gipps ward at next month’s
elections, Mr. Whitford has issued a dodger
with photo, of himself in the act of cloaking
Miss West’s opulent charms, his own costume
being a natty gent.’s dinner suit and a topper,
cocked over the right eye. “Come up and see
us some time” is the legend. A Sydney parson
recently used this gag in his pulpit. It has been
a stock witticism among local Parliamentarians
for the best part of a year. The locker-rooms
of golf clubs echo with it, every Saturday.
Beach sheiks and their female counterparts
employ it habitually; it is exploited in the
latest “Great Australian Movie” (with an imi-
tation Mae West complete); it is rarely
out of the mouths of small boys and girls of
a precocious and otherwise objectionable type.
There has been nothing to touch it for popu-
larity since “Get yer ’air cut!” swept the Eng-
lish-speaking world. Both catchwords, I sub-
mit, are qf deep social significance. The end
•of the nineteenth century was a pugnacious
Jingoistic era when insults were rife: “Get yer
’air cut!” chanted at a perfect stranger, hirsute
or bald, was considered first-class humor
Members of the present generation are not
looking for fight; they have had enough of it
Sex is their hobby, and any gag that can be
given an erotic twist goes accordingly
success of Mae West’s slogan should teli future
historians things about us that few of us sus-
pect about ourselves.
A LILT TO THE LAUREATE.
Singer of quinqueremes from Tyre and Sidon
To coasters manned by Tyneside sailormen,
Through seas that sever and by ways that widen
Unconsciously you take me back to when
The bays you wear adorned the brows of
Dryden,
The lyre you smite was swept by jovial Ben.
I think of all the forebears that you’ve had,
Illustrious, indifferent and bad.
A mixed assortment, truly. Some were glibber
Their odes than others to articulate;
Some dealt in deathless verse, and some in
gibber
And slush you’d think on any ears would
grate.
No halo we assign to Colley Cibber
Or pertinacious Pye or Nahum Tate;
Still, in their ambit and their little day,
They may have had admirers —who can say?
In finer, firmer footsteps yours to follow,
Victorian celebrities sublime
And eminent disciples of Apollo,
Whose clarion notes so bravely ring and
chime
From many an Arcadian height and hollow
Adown the echoing corridors of Time,
Wordsworth, that is, and Tennyson to wit.
Ah! there were giants then, no doubt of it.
No generous butt of Xeres or canary
Goes with your job, to waken fancy’s glow
And set you straying in the realms of faerie,
Since virtuous Robert Southey, long ago—
Proof of how bardic temperaments vary—
Renounced the wine in favor of the dough,
And took his singularly modest fee
No more in Hippocrene but £ s. d.
Across the seas you came, your laurels bringing,
To lay a wreath on the centenary shrine,
The foremost sailor on the seas of singing
Who ever sailed the other sort of brine.
And, in default of any rhyme more ringing
To you, the latest of the Laureate line,
I look respectfully towards you, John,
With just the bald injunction “Carry On!”

“Norbell”: “Jackaburra’s” yarn about
the leggings which were in every way
satisfactory except that they didn’t fit (B.
14/11/ ’34) reminds me of a story Dan
Barry used to tell at his own expense.
Dan had a most conscientious advance
agent, one Barney Levy, and Barney had
been instructed to spy out the land at
Horsham, where a new hall had been
built and whither the Dan Barry co.
was heading for the race date. His tele-
graphed report ran as follows: “New
hall excellent; seats fifteen hundred. Fine
stage, 30-foot proscenium. Town will
be packed for races, prospects splendid,
but hall is engaged for local concert.”

“M.G.”: Probably no calling has suf-
fered from the depression to the same ex-
tent as the model’s. Art classes have
become depleted, buyers of pictures grow
more and more scarce, and the profes-
sion has been invaded by shapely, out-
of-work girls who wouldn’t have con-
sidered posing in normal times. I re-
cently met a bright damsel of my ac-
quaintance at the home of an artist friend
and found to my surprise that she was
the model. A university student, she had
been frozen out when within afewmonths
of her B.A. degree. Apart from this, ama-
teur models, who pose for vanity, friend-
ship or just for fun, are easily obtain-
able. “1 haven’t paid a model for two
years,” said one young painter to me.
“I’ve a heap of girl friends and I draw
on the best of them whenever I want
anybody. The old false sense of shame
has gone and women have grown to be
proud of their figures.”
* * * *
“Imbros”: According to Monash’s
letters, the Turks hadn’t the remotest
suspicion that Gallip-
oli was to be evacu-
ated until the job was
done. “Five thousand
of our men,” he wrote,
“are holding the front
line against 170,000 of
the enemy—if the Turks
only knew it!” Never-
theless, doubts whether
the Turks were so igno-
rant were expressed im-
mediately after the
event. One war corre-
spondent even hinted
that so far from doing
anything to make the
evacuation more difficult,
Jacko would have been
only too happy to facili-
tate it. The story may
be groundless; but the
fact remains that the
withdrawal of the invad-
ing troops was the best
thing that could pos-
sib 1 y have happened
from the point of view
of the Central Powers.
It dealt a damaging blow
to the prestige of the
Allies in the Near East.
“Sailor”: Some ships are lucky if they
ever get into port. Years ago I was
second mate and navigating officer of a
sugar tramp. For the first few months
I was aboard the old packet the skipper
assiduously took altitude observations
with me, both noon and morning sights.
He always squinted at his arc reading,
asked me what my altitude was and in-
variably agreed. One morning, after a
longitude sight, he put his sextant on a
flag locker while he addressed the mate
who was on watch. Having a slight
doubt about the reading on my instru-
ment I took a look at the old man’s, and
was amazed to find the arc pretty well
devoid of figuring through constant use.
The skipper, turning round, angrily
shouted at me to leave other people’s
property alone. He never took another
sight during my stay on board.
* * * *
“Second Murderer”: Why growl at
Parkhill for the tortoise-service of air
mail between here and the U.K.? He
can’t help it; it’s part of the System.
There is a branch post and telegraph
office in Castlereagh-street, near Bathurst-
street, Sydney. A telegraph office, mark
you. It says so on the window in gold
letters. There is a staff of half a dozen
or so behind the counter, as is demanded
“For the ninety-seventh time, darling, will you marry me?”
“Oh, Clarrie, this is so sudden!”
in a lively business area. I dashed in
there last week to send an urgent tele-
gram, and the young gentleman who
attended to me courteously assured me
that my message would be sent as soon
as ever the boy came back for another
batch of telegrams. The office has no
telegraph instruments, no pneumatic
tube, and apparently no telephone, so
it dispatches all telegrams per boy to
the G.P.O. or nearest telegraph office.
When the boy is feeling fresh the service
is entirely efficient.
* * * *
“Lex”: “For the first time in the
Southern Hemisphere, 2000 divorce peti-
tions have been lodged in one year in
one city”—namely Sydney. There were
18,000 marriages in N. S. Wales last year
—and that is above the yearly average—
“You a lifesaver?”
“I am.”
“Well, ’ow about bringin’ us a coupla beers?”
so if all the petitions are granted it will
mean that nearly 10 p.c. of a year’s
marriages have crashed. Even if the
figure is only 8 p.c. it will represent a
sensational record relatively to other
parts of the world. In England, accord-
ing to recent (Registrar-General’s) statis-
tics, about one marriage in 100 goes
west; in France the tally is one in 250
and hundreds of Americans go to Paris
for their divorces every year. No place
outside the U.S.A. has a more liberal
divorce law than N. S. Wales, except that
insanity is still not a ground, but Eng-
land runs it close these days when a wife
can get a decree for adultery alone;
when power to try at Assizes and other
developments of Poor Persons pro-
cedure has brought divorce to the door-
step of the humblest, so to speak ; and
when the Regulation of Reports Act
(1926) has robbed newspaper publicity
of practically all its terrors. An ominous
phenomenon in N. S. Wales in the eye
of those who regard a fracture of the
marriage tie as a calamity is that the pro-
portion of divorce decrees to marriages
is constantly rising.
* * * *
“Taniwha”: Following the Napier
(M.L.) upheaval of 1931 the banks of the
town joined forces to erect a community
building. It was built in 10 days at a cost
of £5OOO, and housed the financial in-
stitutions adequately as long as they
needed it. But nowadays all the banks
have their own premises again ; so the
community bank building is to be dis-
mantled and presented to the 38 settlers
who have taken up five-acre blocks on
the large area of land raised from the
sea by the earthquake. The idea is to
use the building as a hall, though no
doubt in the case of another upheaval
sending the new land under sea again
the structure will afford shelter to the
courageous settlers now raising chickens
and beans on what was four years ago
a popular yacht anchorage.
'i* *l*
“Oxmead”: Secession like poverty,
finds strange bedfellows. Westralian
Agent-General Colebatch, who has been
assuring everyone concerned in England
that if the secession petition is rejected
by the British Parliament his State will
“find some other way out,” was Premier
for a brief period 15 years ago. He gave
mortal offence to the local Labor party
by trying to squelch a wharfside strike by
force. The attempt failed after some
bloodshed and one fatality ; Collier, then,
as now, Labor leader, tartly and defi-
nitely announced his intention of hound-
ing Colebatch out of public life. Prob-
ably he was sincere enough at the
moment, but times change, and we with
them. And nowadays we have the amaz-
ing spectacle of Collier and Colebatch
collaborating in a demand for the dis-
solution of an “indissoluble” Common-
wealth Constitution.
* * * *
“Scribe”: Mention of Jones, one-time
Vic. hangman, reminds me that he was
something of an artist as well as
an efficient craftsman. When he corn-
mitted suicide he left
among the archives
of Melbourne Gfiol a
small drawing-book,
every page of which
contained statistics
about one or other of
his victims name,
age, weight, length of
drop and other de-
tails. Surrounding
the table in each case
was an exquisitely
designed and executed
bit of Gothic illumi-
nation, reminiscent of
the missals of the
Middle Ages, brightly
colored and adorned
with gold and silver.
I saw and examined
this book many years
ago, and just before
Melbourne Gaol was
abolished one of the papers sent a man
to write it up. It was gone, evidence
that there are dishonest people and
snappers-up of unconsidered trifles every-
where —even in gaols.
* :!• *
“Mid-Vic.”: The Americanisms that
are invading the English language leave
me unmoved. Although no Methu-
selah, I can still recall a cultivated old
London dame that dropped many an “h”
that was sounded (she said “ ’orspital,”
“ ’umble,” etc.); pronounced my “me,”
been “bin,” poetry “poytry,” girl “gairl” ;
and her contemporaries did the same.
Incidentally, she used to sound the “h”
in words such as “when” and “why,”
which we treat as homophones ; and that
sounded all right, too. I doubt if we
could understand much of the colloquial
conversation of fashionable Londoners
of 100 years ago (the English have always
used vogue-words, slang and gags, im-
ported or otherwise, which were incom-
prehensible to succeeding generations),
and I’m sure they couldn’t understand
the “Oh, yeahs” and “You’re telling
mes” of b.y.ts. But that isn’t to
say that there is anything wrong with
the Americanisms. It only means that
our language is still alive. A language
is definitely dead when it stops adding to
itself from outside.
•!• *l*
“Bri Chulann”: It would have been
second nature for the G.-G. of the Irish
Free State when declining in Gaelic an
invitation to the royal wedding to have
attached a translation in English. Towns
and streets in the Free State have Gaelic
names, but outside the Gaeltacht they
all have English names written under-
neath ; no Irishman dreams of calling
them by anything but their English
names. The Cosgrave and De Valera
Governments have battled hard to force
the south to talk Gaelic instead of the
tongue of the oppressor, but it’s no good ;
Gaelic is moribund —as much so as
Breton, and more so than Welsh.
“Sp. Vini. Rect.”: That Swedish chem-
ist’s alleged discovery of a test for
drunkenness by determining the amount
of alcohol in the blood (B. 14/11/’34)
leaves me entirely unconvinced. No
reliable test can possibly be applied to
individuals who vary so obviously in
physiological and psychological make-
up. Psychologist McDougall points out
that the extraverted, or man-of-action,
type of person has a poor head for
liquor, whereas his antithesis, the intro-
verted, or thinker type (to which artists,
writers, musicians and poets all belong),
will ptke much more pushing under the
table. The effect of liquor is to render
a man more violent and less controlled ;
the man-of-action type responds more
readily than the other. What seems to
be rjeeded is not so much a method of
determining the alcohol content of the
blofod as a method of determining the
drinker’s degree of extraversion or
introversion.
IT.
“Some tennis players bring to the courts what
Clara Bow is said to have brought to the screen—
‘lt.’ ” —Sydney “Telegraph.”
She’s fine at volleys and serene at smashes;
Across the court she’ll flit and skim and
glide;
Essentially swallow-like, she dashes
From net to baseline and from side to side.
But what ensures her the intense devotion,
Alike of stalls and galleries and pit,
Is not so much her nimbleness in motion
As that infernally elusive It.
At sheer anticipation she’s a daisy,
And yet it takes a trifle more than that
To send tumultuous spectators crazy
And knock the hardest-boiled reporters flat.
Her strokes are artistry; her limbs are comely;
There’s none may doubt her gumption or her
grit:
But what’s the use of it unless she dumbly
Impresses on you she’s endowed with It.
She blends Diana, so to speak, with Haid6e;
She scorns the simple technique of Suzanne
When that impetuously leaping lady
Suggested an with man.
She’ll bang her service down with whirling
racquet,
She. knows the things the cheering crowds
that hit
Are not her shorts, nor yet her natty jacket;
Out and apart from them she’s still a packet
Of palpably intelligible It.

POLITICAL POINTS
Although Victorian co-operation will
be lacking, projected legislation having
been dropped, a Film Quota Bill is to
be introduced in Macquarie-street, Syd-
ney, “as soon as possible,” if not sooner.
It is to apply to distributors as well as
exhibitors, the requirements in the case
of distributors being 5 p.c. of Australian
films in the first year, increasing by 2
p.c. annually to 15 p.c. in the fifth year,
and, in the case of exhibitors, 4 p.c., in-
creasing to p.c. Very pretty, but will
Mr. Stuart Doyle permit it?
To a country deafened with the in-
structions of prelates—the loudest and
most cocksure member of the chorus is
the new Anglican Bishop of Goulburn —
comes Archbishop Macßory from Ire-
land on “a mission purely spiritual.”
I have no message about politics, and
no advice to offer on economics.
An archbishop without a cure-all! There
must be some mistake..
Lyons is to take with him to Eng-
land assistant secretaries to two depart-
ments, his private secretary, his publicity
officer and a supernumerary or two to
“assist in marketing negotiations.” With
Bruce. and men like A. E. Heath, of
N.S.W., in London, plus a plethora of
marketeers and an expensive publicity
organisation, taxpayers might well be
curious as to the need for this whole-
sale emigration.
“The dispute as to who is deputy-leader of
the Commonwealth U.A.P. is to be put to
the vote.”
As Mr. Parkhill is member for Manly,
why not settle it by means of a typi-
cal Manly competition?
In Perth they are telling the story of
an old 28th Battalion man who flopped
in the street. He was too far gone to
tell the ambulance men his name and
address, but by signs he managed to ask
them to fish in his pocket for means of
identification. They found a letter from
Repat. saying that if there was anything
wrong with him it couldn’t possibly be
a result of war service.
News from London has dashed the ex-
pectations of the Dominion League that
the secesh delegates would figure there
in a scene rivalling King Charles’s
descent' on the Commons and the trial
of Warren Hastings. Scot, Englishman
and Jew, they were to have formed up in a
line as stately as they could make
it and marched with their petition to
the Bar of the House. Instead they are
merely to hand it to a member —perhaps
fat old Newton Moore—who will “place
it in a bag behind the Speaker’s chair.”
Under Spooner’s Act the number of
seats in Sydney City Council is to be
increased from 15 to 20, one more for
each ward. Lang Labor has given two
wards, Gipps and Macquarie, a miss,
which means that it is contesting only
12 seats. Though the restriction on the
lodger vote is blamed, it is really an
admission that Langism is waning fast.
Ex-Mayors Walder and Hagon,
Alderman Parkes and Howie, M.L.C.,
have been returned unopposed for the
Macquarie division of Sydney City Coun-
cil. Mayor Parker is out again for
Gipps as an Independent. He will get the
Labor vote, for what it is worth, but the
odds are against him. Still, aldermen
“bucking the machine” fare better, as a
rule, than members of Parliament.
It is raining complimentary dinners to
Latham. No doubt he deserves them.
At the Sydney one he said, very hand-
somely, that he had served under “two
very fine gentlemen, Mr. Lyons and Mr.
Bruce,” and had quitted party politics
with no feeling against it.
It is in the conflict of discussion and
debate that the truth is most likely to
emerge, and unless men stand for their
principles there can be no proper admini-
stration.
Still, complications are apt to arise
when men stand for one set of principles
one time and for an opposite set another
time. That happens occasionally, even
in the case of “very fine gentlemen.”
It transpires that a mysterious somebody
who was paid 15s. per day and out-of-
pocket expenses—a total of £2O0 —has
helped the authorities in the world’s dull-
est capital to institute 44 betting prose-
cutions which have yielded £397 in fines.
The mysterious person should be drafted
to the G.P.O. There he will find the
Government which employs him selling
telephone and telegraph services to s.-p.
bookies and issuing ss. 6d. postal notes
for the convenience of lottery gamblers.
Queensland Parliament passed the rail-
way estimates without one word of dis-
cussion. In a few seconds Government
and Opposition agreed to the disposal
of £4,625,000, ignoring the Auditor-
General’s report, which showed that the
department’s alleged surplus of £160,118
was really a deficit of £726,793. Appar-
ently the well-organised railway unions
are too powerful and alert for any poli-
tician of either party to risk their active
dislike.
It’s a good thing for Westralian Labor
that it won’t have to go to the country
till 1936. It has 10 Assembly seats to
the good, including the Speaker’s ; at a
general election, with the public in its
present temper, it would lose a dozen at
least. It played ducks and drakes with
the Constitution so that one Labor
M.L.C. might keep a paid job, and with
the Electoral Act so that another, guilty
of a gross breach, might not forfeit his
seat. It has now offered the spectacle
of its oldest member imploring the Pro-
perty Chamber to knock the stuffing out
of its Goldmining Profits Tax Bill. An
utterly demoralised party.
In travelling expenses, those of private
secretaries included, the Labor Govern-
ment cost Queensland £5300 last year.
The highest outlay was that of Stopford,
the Mines Minister —it averaged £lB a
week. Bulcock, the Minister for Agricul-
ture, who surely has as much cause to
travel as his colleagues, spent only £199.
Of course, Forgan Smith’s return of
£555 does not include the cost of his
trip to England.
Unemployed - relief tax - revenue in
Queensland keeps pace with increased
employment; for the 1933-34 year :t
grew by £149,432 to £1,900,000. Expen-
diture for the relief of the decreasing un-
employed also grew by £120,000; but,
of course, it was a pre-election twelve-
month. Brisbane, with 31.6 p.c. of the
State’s population, holds 54.9 p.c. of its
relief workers. The Land Board had a
policy which took relief workers from
the city to the country, but Labor
frowned on it.
Study of political butlers waiting for
the customary gratuities.
There has been more talk about shift-
ing Melbourne Hospital to Sydney-road.
Premier Argyle suggests letting the existing
buildings for commercial purposes, but
what form of commerce could be carried
on in structures built for hospital pur-
poses it is difficult to conjecture. Far better
would it be to utilise them for public
servants now housed in rickety weather-
board cottages, and to close that section
of Little Lonsdale-street between the
hospital and the Public Library and make
a garden avenue. The street carries little
traffic.
State rights are a poor defence against
scourges like grasshoppers. In N. S.
Wales notification of the discovery of
grasshopper eggs is required by law;
in Victoria it is not—any careless or
callous landowner discovering acres of
eggs on his property may keep the thing
to himself. The present visitation in
Victoria came - from the north. Next
time the migration may be in the reverse
direction. ’Hoppers are discourteous
insects with no respect for seven Parlia-
ments, dotted lines on maps or even
rivers like the Murray.
Westralian Labor is proceeding from
government by regulation to govern-
ment by deputation. Trades Hall decides
that a certain reform (!) is overdue;
a deputation goes to a Minister;
in a few days down comes a bill. It
began with a demand for a Minister for
Unemployment, and has reached the
stage where nobody is to sell fags after
a certain hour.
Bolivia and Paraguay are members of
the League, but that body made very half-
hearted efforts to prevent the outbreak
of hostilities. Even when those hostili-
ties were in full swing, it just yawned
and went on to the next business. The
Gran Chaco, according to some ac-
counts a patch of worthless desert, is
the ostensible cause of the war. Evil-
minded persons suspect' that there is oil
or something else of value knocking
about.
The poet Blake died three years before
Queensland was first settled. Had des-
tiny brought them together they would
have disagreed. One of Blake’s pro-
phetic couplets:
The Whore and Gambler, by the State
Licensed, build that Nation’s fate.
Queensland has had the combination for
many years.
What a farce the signed election article
can be is shown by the fact that, though
the poll was taken over two months
ago, the unfortunate editor of the Dar-
win newspaper must still inform his read-
ers that all “unsigned articles, paragraphs
and telegrams” relating to it are his
pidgin. He does it in two or three
places in each paper to make sure. You
have to be very careful in a territory
where even the Anglican parish maga-
zine is obliged to furnish a heavy bond
for good behavior.
There is a rooted belief that a lot of
the country in the neighborhood of Syd-
ney is not worth a rush for farming.
Carter, the C.P. M.L.A. for Liverpool
Plains, differs. He says it includes
Thousands of acres of swamp country
that merely requires drainage and im-
proving; excellent white-box lands which,
cleared and placed under sub. clover and
perennial rye, would, carry stock instead
of firewood. And the rainfall is 45in.
Carter thinks that unemployed now
“chipping weeds and shifting sand”
should be helped to have a go at this
country; “but there is only £2OOO on
the estimates for closer settlement,” he
sighs. “Government and people are
lacking in vision.”
It is illegal in Topsy-turvyland for a
“foreign” lottery to compete with the
local gamble. For selling a ticket the
fine is £2O; for advertising the result,
£2OO. Yet in the last £25,000 sweep
drawn in some foreign country appears
the entry:
Sixteenth prize, £5OO. Five police,
c/o Mr. So-and-so, police station,
Topsy-turvyland.
If the law is a dead letter it should be
repealed.
The Kisch case has revealed that it
is within the power of any petty police
magistrate—even a Jay Pea —to make
Commonwealth policy look ridiculous

agitator arrested under the Immigration
Restriction Act. A measure introduced
last week will plug up this hole in the
law, and strengthen it in other respects.
At least one U.A.P. man has come out
with a challenge to pre-selection. Lionel
Dare, a Sydney solicitor, is to stand for
North Sydney as a supporter of Stevens,
and will defy the party organisation to
expel him or refuse him endorsement.
North Sydney is held, somewhat in-
securely, by H. L. Primrose.

An aerial pioneer retired unobtrusively
the other day and went on the Perth
Stock Exchange Norman Brearley,
founder and chief pilot of Westralian
Airways, one of the first two commercial
flying companies in the Empire. Brear-
ley had been a flying man for 18 years.
The first two were the most exciting ;
they earned him a D. 5.0., an Air Force
Cross and an M.C.
Young S. G. O. Martin, who was
called to the N. S. Wales Bar last week,
is a son of Stevens’s Minister for Justice.
He talks, walks and looks like a sturdier
edition of his father. He won a place in
the champion eights and a football cap-
taincy at T.K.S. Since leaving school
he has divided most of his time between
U.A.P. politics and law.
“Monty”: Jack Sabelburg has died at
Alfred Hospital, Melbourne. A very
old Bulletin contributor, he was a
remarkable example of courage in ad-
versity. At the age of 15 he fractured
his spine. For 45 years he lived in an
invalid’s chair, and no one heard him
whine. To talk to him was like convers-
ing with a genial “Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica” ; he could start on archery and
go right through to zoology if required.
His father who was the oldest practising
solicitor in Victoria, passed out a few
months back at 93.
The Poet Laureate.
From “Also R.A.N.”:
Not being a prohibited immigrant, a hitch-
hiking golfer or a world flier, General
Godley arrived almost unnoticed in Melbourne,
and he hasn’t received much attention since,
except from Diggers. Since commanding the
western defences at Mafeking and an army
corps in Gallipoli, Godley has been C.-in-C. of
the British Army on the Rhine and of the
Southern Command, A.D.C.-General to the
King, and Governor and C.-in-C. of Gibraltar.
Yet he is also liable to go unnoticed in London.
Sitting in an almost empty Guards’ Club he
felt like tea, and asked a near-by subaltern to
join him with an introductory “I’m Godley!”
“I’m righteous,” replied the bright veteran of
two seasons’ campaigning in Mayfair and Bel-
gravia.
Harley Stumm, Queensland Rhodes
scholar for 1936, has represented his uni-
versity in rowing and football, and was
a member of the Australian Universities’
football team that toured Japan. He
means to read for a B.C.L. at Oxford
and practise at the Bar when he gets
back to Brisbane.
It was appropriate that Pat Osborne,
of Currandooley, should have won the
Ulster Handicap at Randwick last week
with Care Free ; the original Osbornes
were Ulstermen. The A.J.C. committee
has no cheerier member than this repre-
sentative of the great pastoral family. He
is also the family’s only prominent rac-
ing owner. He has bred and owned
thoroughbreds ever since he first appeared
in public as an amateur rider 40 years
ago.
“Nordbo”: Henry Stratton-Brown,
F.M.S. rubber-planter and pioneer avia-
tor, passed Cairns the other day en route
to Singapore from Sydney. He is sailing
his 30ft. ketch Mystery single-handed.
When his Avro-Avian, the first ’plane in
Malaya, went west he left for England
to buy another, but the rubber slump
put a crimp in his wings. He came to
Sydney shortly afterwards, designed
the Mystery and built her with his own
hands. Brown holds the Hawkesbury
Diploma of Agriculture, and is keeping
his eye open for suitable spots for plan-
tations as he creeps north.
P. M. Hishon, who becomes Queens-
land’s new chief P.M. in place of H. L.
Archdall, retired, has been dispensing
justice for 45 years. More than half
have been spent on the northern gold-
and copper-fields, and few know more
about mining law and lore. Since 1921
he has sat on the metropolitan Bench.
The Poet Laureate
hasn’t received all the
attention Sydneyites would
like to have paid him,
owing to the presence of
the Duke, but he holds a
secure place in their
hearts. Here is Finey’s
tribute. Mr. Masefield
was entertained at lunch
by the writers of N. S.
Wales last week, and he
made a speech afterwards
that was as delightful in
its whimsical way as one
of his poems.
“Mime”: If Arthur
Pinero had died 30 years
ago, instead of last week,
his newspaper obituaries
would have run to
columns. As it is, he has
passed almost unnoticed.
Unlike his contemporary
Shaw (Pinero was 79;
Shaw is a few months
younger) his mind didn’t
move with the times. He
had been intellectually
dead for quarter of a cen-
tury, though he was writ-
ing charming plays and
playlets almost to the date
of his last illness. Pinero
was a striking figure in his
prime, with the thin re-
pressed face of an ascetic
set off by heavy black
eyebrows. He began his
stage career under Irving, took to
play-writing in the ’eighties, and after
establishing himself as a writer of farce
with “The Magistrate” he scandalised
the world of his day with “The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray.” A great craftsman,
but he had nothing of importance to say.
“El V.” on a visitor:
Lord Sempill, the latest Briton to reach
Australia by air, is the 19th Baron. Queen
Elizabeth sent one of his line as Ambassador
to Spain after the Armada mess had been
cleaned up. Eton didn’t kill his desire to
be an engineer, and he was just through a
shop apprenticeship in time to join the R.F.C.
He was 21 when the war began. He rose to
be a wing-commander. He has been three
times president of the Royal Aeronautical
Society, and is deputy chairman of the council
of the London Chamber of Commerce. He
has competed in the King’s Cup seven times,
sits on most of the important aerial committees
of Great Britain, and is a director of hall a
dozen companies handling aircraft or aircraft
material. He has reported on the Greek Air
Force, he supervised the organisation and
equipment of the Japanese Naval Air Force
in 1921, and he has written a technical classic
on aerial fuels.
Frith’s impression of
Andrew Sneddon, the new
general manager of the
A.M.P. No sylph, but a
big man in every way who
always keeps fit. He does
it mostly nowadays at
Long Reef Golf Club: he
used to be a near-cham-
pion at rowing. The g.m.
has been in the great
society’s service for 37
years. Except for five
years in London just be-
fore the war, he has
spent the whole of his
professional life in N. S.
Wales, where he was born
and educated.
Cardinal Macßory has
arrived as Papal Legate to
the Melbourne Eucharis-
tic Congress. The Cardi-
nal was born in County
Tyrone 73 years ago. He
was vice - president of
Maynooth College from
1912 to 1915, when he was
appointed Bishop of
Down and Connor. In
1928 he became Archbishop of Armagh,
and the Red Hat was conferred on
him the year following. He plays an
enthusiastic game of golf when the
chance offers.
Jack Scaddan is dead. Thirty years
ago he arrived in Westralian Assembly
fresh from an engine-driver’s job on the
Golden Mile ; in 1910 he became leader
of the Labor party ; a year later saw him
Premier (at 35) with a thumping
majority. If ever a man looked to have
the political ball at his feet it was “Happy
Jack” —a nickname fastened on him by
a newspaper competition. He was a
breezy and vigorous speaker and was
liked even by his opponents. His troubles
began during the war. His Ministry sur-
vived the 1914 election, but in 1916 it
was bumped out —Bertie Johnston, now
a C.P. Senator, dealt it the final
blow. After a period of indecision
Scaddan came down on the non-Labor
side in the conscription controversy, and
after that his career was a chequered
one. He won seats and lost them, aban-
doned politics for an unsuccessful excur-
sion into the paths of commerce, and
then again secured a metropolitan seat
and a portfolio under his old opponent
Jimmy Mitchell, only to lose both last
year.
“S.T.S.”: Prof. Harold Davies, of
Adelaide Conservatorium, says that in
S. Aus. just now there must be “some
mysterious influence at work in the
hidden laboratories of Nature.” Brenton
Langbein, a fiddler, aged six, is compared
by his teachers with Philip Hargrave the
pianist at that age. Alison Nelson, at
I\, is already up to Grade IV ; she has
“absolute pitch, reads fluently at sight and
has unusual interpretative sense.” Audrey
White, barely five, is a marvel of “in-
stinctive musical memory,” without any
teaching as yet; she plays anything by
ear. This infant, on the testimony of
her mother, a music-teacher of repute,
“sang the melody of the Finale of Beet-
hoven’s Sonata in F Major” at 13
months!
Dr. Andrew Killian, who has been co-
adjutor to Archbishop Spence in S.A.
and succeeds him, arrived in Australia
from Ireland in ’9B. He worked up
from Bourke (N.S.W.) to Broken Hill,
which he left for Port Augusta (S.A.).
He has a better knowledge of the back-
blocks, and of the problems of miners
and farmers, than probably any arch-
bishop who ever lived.
Bill Drage, of Holbrook (N.S.W.), has
an odd record. He has spent the whole
of his 70 years in the same district, and
during that time he has been in turn
bullocky, horse-teamster and motor-
lorry driver.
ANDREW SNEDDON, the A.M.P.’s new g.m.
“Hush”: Ludwig Kurth, Australia’s
oldest German, has celebrated his 101st
birthday in Ipswich (Q.). He helped to
build the first bridge over the Brisbane
River at Spencer’s Crossing. He reads
without glasses.

Capstan Clock Series, No. 9
Prague, the capital of the Czechoslovak Republic,
is Europe's pre-eminent historical city. A thousand
years ago it was the capital of an independent
Czech State, and from that time until the begin-
ning of the 17th century it maintained that
position.
During the Hussite Wars, and later the Thirty
Years' War, the history of Bohemia was tragic, and
with the accession of the Hapsburg dynasty to the
Bohemian throne, the way zvas paved for the
defeat of the Czechs, and their loss of independ-
ence to Austria.
During its period of greatest importance—and
particularly during the reign of Charles IV. —
Prague became embellished with buildings and
monuments that help to make it such a 'marvellous
‘Took of architecture" to-day.
In the Old Town, pride of place must be given to
the Old Town Hall, which is the historic centre
of Prague. The oldest part is the Tower and the
Chapel inside the tower, while outside is the
famous Bohemian clock made in 1490 and still
drawing groups of people daily at noon to see the
procession of the apostles when the hour strikes.
Old clock that hast for nigh five hundred years
Most faithfully recorded restless Time —
Nor heeded Prague’s grim struggles and the tears
Of vanquished patriots—long may your chime
Mark peace and banished fears.
In Central Europe —as in other parts of the
world —are many famous clocks with important
historical associations. All over the British
Empire clocks are often associated with the
thought—" Time for a Capstan

Marked growth in the figures in all sec-
tions of the business is the outstanding
feature of the latest accounts. The ex-
pansion in the volume of business in
force in the Ordinary and Industrial de-
partments combined (£61,090,957) was
£4,100,154, or more than double the
previous year’s increase. The aggregate
amount of new business put on the books
(£12,816,814, up £1,303,362) was the
largest yet. Another welcome movement
was a shrinkage of £102,566 in sur-
renders, etc. (£349,070). Including Acci-
dent figures, the spring in the year’s net
premiums (£3,267,381) was £215,127, and
interest and rents (£905,353) were up
£64,367, making the growth in total
income (£4,172,734) £279,494. The
£1,648,401 added to Assurance funds,
raising them to £20,338,366, was £371,349
more than the previous year’s addition,
thanks mainly to a lighter crop of claims,
which reflects the shrinkage in surrenders.
As in the preceding term, that was after
striking £50,000 off the book value of
premises and sending a like amount to
the fidelity and contingency fund
(£526,451).
When the books closed the combined
funds of the Ordinary and Industrial de-
partments exceeded the combined liabili-
ties under policies by £720,071, up
£28,462:
1930. 1932. 1933. 1934.
Net surplus:—

Total . . £588,671 £680,140 £691,609 £720,071
The spring of £28,462 in last year’s total
surplus is due largely to a reduction of
£79,098 in the tax bill (£68,574). After
reserving £50,000 for contingencies, re-
versionary bonuses on the same scale as
for the two preceding years are to be dis-
tributed.
The office assumes that its funds will
turn in a uniform 3 p.c. After deduct-
ing taxes, the effective net return on
total funds was £4 4s. Bd. as against
£3 15s. lid. in 1933. The margin avail-
able for policy-holders has thus been
substantially widened.
In the Ordinary section both the aver-
age amount per policy (£273) and the
average premium, per cent. (£3 10s. 6d.)
were a trifle lighter:
1932. 1933. 1934.

the year’s net premiums as against 17.4,
17.1, 18.8 and 19 p.c. for the four pre-
ceding years.
In the Industrial branch exes, less
taxes got away with 35.9 p.c. of the net
premiums (£1,798,928, up £87,146) as
against 35.6 p.c. and 34.9 p.c. in ’33 and

Formed in 1904 by a few Melbourne
hotelkeepers, this co. paid divs.. ranging
from a mere 20 p.c. p.a. to 110 p.c. p.a.
over the next 26 years, and for a long
time the ss. shares fetched around 255.
in the market. In 1920 each ss. share
was exchanged for one fully-paid £1
share. Five years later the business
passed to Carlton and United Breweries
for £650,000 in ord. shares. At the same
time £71,974 of bonus scrip was issued,
followed by another £143,993 worth in
1928, when the face value of the pound
shares was split in halves.
Paid capital thus became £431,981 in
10s. shares. At the end of July last this,
the reserves and £3261 coming to credi-
tors were represented by 650,000 C.U.B.
£1 ords., in at face value ; hotel free-
holds and shares in other cos., etc.,
£36,039; Government securities, £51,180;
secured advances, £15,875; cash, etc.,
£lB.
What the shares and other assets have
turned in and the cost of handling the
income the next table shows:

including taxation.
For the year to June 30, 1933, the
C.U.B. paid 10 p.c. as against 10, l\\
and 15 p.c. for the three preceding years,
and 17y p.c. for the three years before
that. Over the same period its declared
net earnings were 12.2 p.c. on capital as
against 12.2, 11.4, 12.3, 17, 21.6 and
22.8 p.c. At the close of accounts in
1933 there was visibly £1,388,575 of re-
serves to support and assist £1,950,000
of capital in 200,000 7 p.c. cum. prefs.
and 1,750,000 ords. —the prefs. advance
with the ords. beyond 7 p.c.
C.U.B. now proposes to capitalise
£975,000 of its reserves, thus avoiding
the extra taxation to be imposed on such
operations after the end of December
next. The distribution will consist of
100,000 prefs. and 875,000 ords., to be
handed out in the proportion one new
pref. for every two prefs. now held, and
likewise with the ords. That will raise
paid capital to £2,925,000, on which a
10 p.c. div. will call for £57,960 more
than was netted in 1933, or £99,000-odd
less than average net earnings for the
half-dozen years to the close of accounts
in 1930. Certainly conditions have
changed vastly since, but the co. has
bought a lot of hotel freeholds in the last
four years, and unemployment is de-
creasing. So 10 p.c. on £2,925,000 may
not prove to be out of reach.
The gift will lift the Co-op.’s holding
to 975,000 shares. A 10 p.c. return from
these would raise net earnings (on the
basis of last year’s p. and 1. figures) to
£66,000-odd, equal to over 15 p.c. on
its own £431,981 of capital. At 425. the
10s. shares would return 3.5 p.c. on a
15 p.c. div. basis. A one-for-two gift
issue and drop in the div. to 10 p.c.
would give the same return.

It’s a snug business, and has been ever
since the public became interested
in 1922, when Brown and Poison’s was
taken over. The co., which is in the
wholesale dry-goods trade, turns out
several well-established proprietary lines,
and new plant, installed just before the
big break in the markets, helped to keep
costs down. The div. has been kept
steady at 10 p.c. for the last dozen
years, and for the half-dozen to the close
of accounts in 1930 it was sweetened by
a 2+ p.c. bonus. There were some
new issues at par which were also in
the nature of a bonus to shareholders,
the scrip commanding a high premium in
the market.
After providing for depreciation, etc.,
and setting aside £5500 (£7OOO in the
previous year) for the taxgatherer, and
again openly reserving £5OO for doubt-
ful debts, the board figured the year’s
net earnings at 11.8 p.c. on average capi-
tal as against 11.9, 10.9, 12, 13, 15.5 and
15.4 p.c. back to 1928. That was after
adding £BOO to the insurance account
(£9460) and £363 net to the reserve
for contingencies and depreciation
(£110,274), neither of which is included
with the lay-by in the table, the lot being
subject to £72,500 of intangibles.
The trend of business is upwards, and
the board expects to exhibit still better
figures at next balance.
The market for the pound shares is
steady at 50s. as against 38s. two years
ago. At the higher figure the return is
4 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. Including
the depreciation and insurance reserves,
the net tangible cover is 345.

*Nine months. Pref. div. subject to Interest
Reduction Act from October 1, 1931.
Last year’s £42,406 of profit, up £12,516,
is the best since the present co. took
over the business from John Norton’s
trustees in 1925. The spring is due mainly
to increased revenue from advertising
and circulation, following the recovery in
conditions generally, and to the board’s '
work in repairing and stiffening the
organisation. Early in the piece plant
in all States was modernised, free-
holds were bought in the three east-
ern capitals, and new premises were
erected in Sydney. To help finance the
outlay £155,000 of fresh capital was
gathered, raising the total to £400,000 in
100,000 9 p.c. first prefs., a like number
of 8 p.c. seconds and 200,000 ords.
Then slump brought earnings down
with a rush, and the ord. div. fell from
124 p.c. in ’2B to 5 p.c. in ’3O, and re-
mained there for the next two years.
Meanwhile, the N. S. Wales Interest Re-
duction Act slashed p.c. off the prefs.’
contract rates, leaving them the right to
advance with the ords. from the reduced
to the original rates. As conditions
improved the figures responded nicely.
After paying the prefs. their full 9 p.c.
and 8 p.c. respectively, enough remained
to show 12.7 p.c. on ord. capital last
year, and the div. was lifted from 6|
p.c. to 10 p.c. The £5406 that remained,
together with an unexplained addition
of £13,019 to reserves, reduced the
amount of capital unrepresented by tan-
gibles to £45,221 at June 30.
The financial position improved:

strengthened by £34,821. The amount
coming to sundry creditors was increased
by £3703, investments were reduced by
£5540 and stocks by £4042. On plant
£4905 more was written off than was
spent. The improvement in the more
or less liquid surplus (£71,652, including
stocks) was £27,433.
Over the last 12 months the firsts have
advanced from 265. to 345. and the sec-
onds from 225. 6d. to 31s. 3d. in the
market. At the higher prices the return
is 5.2 p.c. and 5.1 p.c. respectively on
the basis of last year’s distributions. The
net tangible cover is £3 10s. lid. firsts
and £2 10s. lid. seconds. The ords.,

gibles, are not listed.

After four years without a taste, the
ords. are back in the picture, and, unless
something very extraordinary happens,
they are likely to remain there, with en-
couraging prospects. When the public
became interested 10 years ago, it was a
10.8 p.c. proposition. Presently share-
holders put up an extra £96,406, of which
£10,726 was share premiums, to help
finance the installation of a new Nathan
brewing plant. But little of the trade
appears to have been anchored, and
slump, which meant contraction of earn-
ings and trouble with debtors’ balances,
brought a run of losses, and £24,959 of
the capital was unrepresented by tan-
gibles in the books at the end of July,
1933. The losses, however, were due
largely to provision for depreciation and
bad and doubtful debts.
Now that the outlook has cleared suf-
ficiently for board to see more definitely
where the business stands, it has been
decided to tidy up the accounts. Includ-
ing £11,964 from last year’s earnings, the
provision for depreciation stood at
£131,372. Of this £24,614, being pro-
vision in excess of admitted requirements
for the purpose, was used to rub out all
but a trifle of the deficit on shareholders’
accounts. The balance (£106,758) was
written off the book value of fixed assets,
down £98,999:

Also, the reserve against book debts, etc.
(£23,193, equal to 14s. 7d. in the £ of
debtors’ balances at July 30, 1933) dis-
appeared. Visibly, the year’s net reduc-
tion in book debts was only £2456. The
already moderate outside debt was re-
duced by £6620. The improvement in the
more or less liquid surplus (£49,588, in-
cluding stocks) was £4766.
Gross earnings, which fell from £43,270
in 1927 to £17,286 in 1930, were £54,976
last year, when the spring was £6249.
There was little change in ordinary trad-
ing exes. (£19,258) and the allowance for
depreciation (£11,964). No specific allow-
ance was made for bad debts, etc.,
whereas £9791 was so set aside in the
previous term. The net result was thus
£15,090 better at 10.3 p.c. on capital, and
5 p.c. was distributed, leaving the whole
of the capital intact and £11,985 besides.
Over the twelvemonth the market
has lengthened its bid for the pound
shares from 16s. 9d. to 275. The return
at the higher figure is 3.6 p.c. on a 5
p.c. div. basis, or a shade under 4\ p.c.
on a 6 p.c. distribution, which is com-
fortably inside last year’s earnings. The
cover is 21s. in net tangibles.

It is the co.’s jubilee year ; but times
are too hard and the outlook too uncer-
tain to warrant anything special in the
way of distribution. Certainly the ord.
div. was lifted from 2\ p.c. to 5 p.c., but
the 5 p.c. was well within earnings. Over
the half century the ords. averaged 64-
p.c., sweetened with a one-for-two bonus
scrip issue in 1921 ; a steady 10 p.c. was
paid for the six years to the close of
accounts in 1930. Though conditions
have changed completely since then,
movements in the figures suggest that the
board lost no time in making a success-
ful assault upon its problems, chiefly
overhead and stocks.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, unemployment in the
Dominion decreased, monthly sales-tax
collections rose by over 12 p.c., and the
clothing, drapery and footwear price

A SUFkE FRIEND IN UNCERTAIN TIME'S
Come in, my A.M.P.
FRIEND!
IT is a wise man who takes time now and again to
talk over his affairs with an A.M.P. counsellor.
There’s comfort in it, and there’s prosperity in
it, too, for an A.M.P. counsellor has a wide ex-
perience and knows what hundreds of other men, in
similar circumstances, are doing to make their
futures secure.
The Society recently published the results of a
Limited Premium Policy for £3,000 effected by Mr.
George Judah Cohen when he was a young man.
By investing £248/10/- a year for five years Mr.
Cohen was able recently to draw £9,037, the amount
of the policy plus bonuses. It was, to most people,
an amazing result, but the policy Mr. Cohen took
out can be taken out by any man in good health.
There are many kinds of A.M.P. policies. There are
policies to meet every life risk that a man runs; to
provide income for old age; to educate children; to
pay off mortgages; to secure the home; all designed
to give men and women peace of mind.
It is a wise man who says to the A.M.P. counsellor:
“Come in and give me your advice!”

index strengthened a trifle. It is all re-
flected in a spring of £18,590 in the
year’s gross earnings (£209,284). Exes.
(£182,700) took £9126 of the increase,
due mainly to a bigger tax bill. But the
statutory cut reduced the pref. div. from
6 p.c. to 5 p.c. for three years from the
close of accounts in 1932; so, allow-
ing for minor reserve adjustments,
enough remained to show 7.8 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 2.5 p.c. in the previous
term. The extra £21,969 of reserves dis-
closed (contingencies £19,540 and plate-
glass £2429) was previously lumped with
sundry creditors in the published
accounts.

During the year £66,000 was raised on
mortgage to pay off deposits at call.
After allowing for reserves disclosed, the
net reduction in the amount coming to
outsiders was £5650. The growth of
£19,539 in stocks was due to early arrival
of the new season’s goods. The actual
improvement in the more or less liquid
surplus (£62,037, including stocks) was
£29,981. On fixed assets £19,783 more
was written off than was spent.
The immediate outlook is for a better
showing at next balance, notwithstanding
the drop in the price of wool. Over the
last 12 months the pound prefs. have
advanced from 20s. to 275. 3d. in the
market, and the fully-paid 10s. ords.
from 13s. to 15s. 6d. At the higher
figures the returns are 3.6 p.c. and 3.2
p.c. respectively on the basis of last
year’s distributions. The net tangible
cover per pound of paid capital is £2
ss. lOd. prefs. and 355. sd. ords.
Mt. Morgan
The board’s decision to issue (date not
yet fixed) 128,000 new ss. shares at a
premium of 15s. each, in the proportion
of 16 for 100, is a nice Christmas-box
for shareholders. Following the an-
nouncement the scrip rose sharply from
355. to 38s. in the market. The rights
should thus be worth around 15s. When
fully paid the issue will bring in £96,000
of premium money and add £32,000 to
share capital, making it £232,000 in
928,000 shares of ss. each. The money
is to be spent £41,008 on the concentra-
tor, £31,661 on mine development,
£9OOO on the power plant and
£30,000 on the tailings retreatment
plant, etc., leaving £11,331 to finance
further expansion of the co.’s pro-
gramme. The object is to further liven
extraction and treatment (now over
15,000 tons of crudes a month), improve
recoveries and lower costs. After satis-
factory results from the pilot plant, the
Edquist process is to be introduced.
With gold at £8 10s. an ounce (Austra-
lian currency), this is expected to add at
least 3.2255. net to the recoverable value
of each ton of ore. On a basis of 15,000
tons of crudes a month (more will be
treated when enlargement of the plant
is complete) net earnings (£80,569 for
the year to June 30 last) should benefit
by over £29,000 p.a. It also means a
nice addition to ore reserves, conserva-
tively estimated at 7,748,000 tons, averag-
ing 4.2Bdwt. gold and 1.76 p.c. copper—
of the 152,983 tons treated last year, 40
p.c. had been previously reckoned as
overburden ; the lot assayed s.9dwt. gold
and 0.4 p.c. copper. The concentrating
ratio was 26.4 to 1, and recoveries 66.81
p.c. gold and 83.02 p.c. copper. In addi-
tion to the ore in the mine, there is a big
heap of tailings, estimated to contain
115,0000 z. of gold, which can be recov-
ered at a profit.
Gold Mines of Australia has taken
another option, this time from the
N.Q.G.M. Development Co., over
practically the whole of the old Oaks
goldfield, near Kidston, 60 miles by road
from Einasleigh, which is 250 miles by
rail from Cairns (N.Q.). The field is a
big low-grade deposit, of which some
3,000,000 to 4,000,000 tons can be mined
by open cutting. At Adelong Creek
(N.S.W.) preliminary boring on an area
containing some 18,000,000 c.y. indicates
an average of about two grains of gold
per yard. Scout-boring of this area is
now under way, and more ground in
the valley is to be tested. No profitable
alluvial has been located on the Gilbert,
Etheridge or Upper Burdekin rivers (Q.),
nor on the Mitchell River (N.S.W.). On
the Lower Burdekin, however, the co. has
applied for a prospecting concession
covering 36 miles. Testing of the tailings
dumps at Ravenswood and Mt. Leyshon
(Q-) continues, but work on the Buck
reef has ceased, pending discussions with
the vendors.
Gold production this year from the
Cracow field (Q.) looks very lopsided.
Up to the end of August the figures were
19,1290 z., of which Plateau claimed
18,7840 z.. Next' best on local crushing
was Lambert’s Surprise with 1630 z. The
Accumulation lode has come into pro-
minence, owing to its purchase by Roma
North. Besides workings to a depth of
100 ft., this co. has 200 tons of ore at
grass, estimated to exceed £lO per ton.
It has also taken over the smaller Gol-
conda for £750 cash, plus 5000 paids, and
next year should run into second place
on the field. The co. recently sent 15
tons to Port Kembla for 3000 z., so it is
amongst the gold.
* * * *
Hawkwood Gold Mines (C.Q.) tally
for the last three months, all from the
Narayen, is 498 tons for gold, valued at
£6300. November’s average was nearly
£l5 a ton. A 4d. dividend has just been
paid, and another distribution is expected
before Christmas. The best news is that
the newly-discovered ore-shoot is now
showing a width of 2ft. 6in., averaging
about 15dwt. Low-grade ore from the
South Narayen will also be tried out,
values having improved in recent de-
velopment.
* * * *
Storey’s Creek (Tas.), a steady pro-
ducer of wolfram and tin, continues to
open up well. The new ore-body met
with in the 100 ft. shaft has been driven
in for over 600 ft., the width being from
Bft. to 9ft., and the ore is reported to be
high-grade. The mine is owned by a
syndicate of half a dozen local in-
vestors, and has been worked for over 40,
years.

“Rifus”: Leaseholders at Kalgoorlie
are growling at the Government again.
The State battery at Hannan’s has
been out of commission for five weeks,
and, although an additional five-head
of stamps has been erected, it will
take over two months to put through
7000 tons of accumulated ore. This
means that many a prospector will miss
his Christmas crushing. Further, the
closing down of the Commonwealth
Health Laboratory—while the carpenters
are busy the sensitive X-ray apparatus has
to be kept in cotton-wool—has resulted
in a stoppage of mineworkers’ health
tickets, without which employment on the
mines is unobtainable. Certainly, pro-
visional clearance certificates are being
granted, but a man who has had one
cannot secure another. All he can do is
remain idle until the laboratory gets back
to business, unless any employer cares to
risk a £2OO fine.

Contrary to Westralian expectations,
Associated Gold Mines of W.A. (New),
Ltd., is not cleaning up and distributing
all its assets in cash. The board has
arranged to dispose of the co.’s belong-
ings to Associated Mining and Finance,
Ltd. —it and the new Associated Co.
were the only beneficiaries under
the will of the original Associated Gold
Mines of W.A., Ltd. Two of the three
directors of Associated G. M. are on
the board of Associated Mining and
Finance, which, besides holding a wad
of Associated G. M. shares, is mainly
interested in Canadian gold and silver
ventures and Wiluna and Lake View and
Star. Associated Gold shareholders are
to receive 2s. cash plus one Associated
Mining and Finance Bs. share for every
two shares now held. The issued capital
of the Finance Co. will be £333,847 in
834,618 shares of Bs. each. In round
figures its assets are valued at £582,000.

During October Norseman (W.A.)
treated 2654 tons of ore and 2072 tons
of tailings for bullion valued at £11,557,
Australian currency. Estimated work-
ing exes, were £3BOO.

The high values mentioned in Cool-
gardie Brilliant’s prospectus have not been
maintained. After a small crushing, it
has been announced that the Brilliant’s
future depends on the quantity rather
than quality of its make-up. Accounts
show cash £18,090, and £355 due to
creditors.

“Old Hand”: Owing to indifferent
saving appliances, the loss of gold on
the West Coast of Maoriland must be
enormous. My 10 years’ prospecting ex-
perience on the Buffer, Matakitaki,
Maruia and other rivers showed that
not less than 25 p.c. of gold is lost under
ordinary conditions. Mercury is use-
less in saving the flour gold ; it simply
floats away. This I have demonstrated
and seen demonstrated thousands of
times. There are many dredging and
sluicing shows just wanting this extra
gold to pay dividends. They could
materially increase their returns by in-
stalling appliances similar to that adopted
by Bulolo Gold Dredging.

“With Williamson Beneath the Sea”
Mr. Williamson, his wife and infant
son descend to the sea-floor by way of
a funnel, and their surroundings are
photographed through the windows of
an undersea room. Most of the shots
produce effects which may be seen in
any good aquarium, and some of the
others are fakes. Notably a struggle
between a swimmer, some divers and a
property octopus. The sharks which are
revealed cruising about tearing at bait on
a hook and eventually being caught are
interesting. Mr. Williamson’s melo-
dramatic comments are not.
“The Cat’s Paw”
According to tradition every clown
yearns to play Hamlet. Harold Lloyd
is reputed to be the richest man in
George Arliss in “The House of Roth-
schild,” at Sydney Regent.
Hollywood, and he has entered the for-
ties, so there were further reasons why
he should have adventured with a new
medium. In his latest film at Sydney
Plaza, he is a righteous youth who has
been brought up in China in the home
of his father, a missionary. In America,
his high ideals stamp him as a half-wit
in the opinion of the political gangsters
who control the town he visits. He
becomes Mayor by accident, and to the
dismay of the gangsters proceeds to pun-
ish wrongdoers on Chinese lines.
This is where the fun comes in. There
is a grisly sequence during which one
thug after another is dragged off by
Chinese executioners, their decapitated
bodies being subsequently borne past the
surviving thugs on stretchers. Actually,
the gangsters are not beheaded ; they and
their horrified colleagues are the victims
of an ingenious Chinese trick.
The film differs from those of Chap-
lin, Charlie Chase et al., inasmuch as
hardly any of the laughs are secured by
the hero. George Barbier gets most of
them as an obese, opulent-looking crook
who alienates sympathy by his truculent
villainies, and when threatened with
death becomes a gibbering cur. Nat
Pendleton evokes shrieks of amusement
on similar lines, and Una Merkel is in
her element as a vulgar worldling who
likes Lloyd, but' is completely baffled by
his manner and methods.
“The Cat’s Paw” demonstrates that
there is nothing comic about Harold
Lloyd in the sense that, say, Laurel or
Hardy is comic ; his voice is as wooden
as his expression. But he knows how to
choose laughable situations, and he is
quaint by contrast as he moves, poker-
faced, among them.
“Palooka”
Schnozzle Durante, Stuart Erwin and
Lupe Velez are billed as the stars of this
fistic fantasia, but Majorie Rambeau as
Mayme Palooka, wife of one middle-
weight champion and mother of another,
scores what acting honors are going. The
Palookas, as Mayme remarks (she used
to be a headliner in vaudeville), are the
best fellows in the world, but they can’t
stand success ; so when Palooka junior
(Erwin) is billed to defend a champion-
ship he won because the holder was
stewed to the eyes she wires him “I hope
he knocks your block off. Love, Mother.”
Throughout the action she lives up to
that note. Palooka junior is defeated,
and goes back to mother on the farm,
after a great deal of vamping by Miss
Velez. Mechanism of the story is well-
worn, but the casting is excellent and
Durante’s malapropisms are occasionally
quite funny. At Sydney Capitol.
“Charlie Chan in London”
Warner Oland’s idea of a Chinese de-
tective has a busy time in the Hollywood
idea of an English country house filled
with hunting folk. He has three days
to discover who murdered a young
aviator in the stable with a Malay kris
taken from the library, for the wrongly-
accused hero is booked to be hanged at
the end of that period. Another murder
and two attempts at homicide put Mr.
Chan on the right track, and the mis-
creant is unmasked at the eleventh hour,
leaving, however, a good many of the
suspicious circumstances that implicated
the wrong people unexplained. Also at
the Capitol.
“The Great Flirtation”
A slow-moving affair. Adolphe Men-
jou is Stephan Karpath, the actor-sensa-
tion of Europe. In Budapest he loves
and quarrels with ElisSa Landi because
she imagines she can act, too. Then they
go to New York, are married and flop.
Stephan becomes Steve to producers of
second-rate plays, and at home his wife
spurns him.
And now the female star in the play
Steve is rehearsing walks out; Miss
Landi takes her place with instant suc-
cess, and falls in love with the author.
Steve gives the greatest performance of
his career; renounces his wife, though
his heart is breaking, and, accompanied
by his manservant', the only person who
realises his genius, goes forth into the
snow to a vaudeville contract in Dakota.
The principals do their best with the
well-worn material. Lynne Overmann,
who repeats his one character, this time
as a cynical theatrical director, gets most
attention.
“The Notorious Sophie Lang”
All about “the woild’s greatest crim-
inal,” who, wounded in her professional
pride by the arrival of a master jewel
Florence Arliss in “The House of
Rothschild.”
thief from Europe, returns to the game.
She has been in retirement for five years,
but such is her brilliancy that inside 24
hours she carries out two daring jewel
robberies, meets and learns to love her
rival, and proves to him that she is still
the woild’s supreme crook. The one
redeeming feature about the thing is that
the characters realise they’re taking part
in an episode from a boy’s comic-paper
story, and act accordingly.
Gertrude Michael and Paul Cavanagh
lead, and it’s at the Prince Edward with
“The Great Flirtation.”
Some First Nights
Sydney’s Venetian Carnival wasn’t a
bit like its prototypes, but it was an im-
pressive show, and it had an audience

Sydney Plaza.
that must have beaten all records. If the
tides in future seem to reach higher levels
in Port Jackson it will be because the
foreshores sank on Saturday night under
their load of humanity. The headlands
flanking Farm Cove and facing it on the
north side were crowded before the
sun sank ; after that they were clogged.
The northsiders had the most unre-
stricted view. Most of the populace in
the Outer Domain, particularly those in
the vicinity of Mrs. Macquarie’s chair,
were at first inclined to curse the man
who planted Moreton Bay fig-trees all
over the promontory, but discovered that
the show was on such a vast scale that
the densest of foliage couldn’t obliterate
rocket's that soared to the zenith and
searchlight beams that swept the heavens
and the earth and all that was therein.
Everybody agreed that never before had
Sydney seen such rockets nor such a mad
riot of stabbing rays. The Bridge was
the searchlights’ target at the end of each
display, and stood out cold and grey and
so sharply defined that one could almost
count the rivets. Sussex, Australia and
Canberra and various smaller warships
were outlined in strings of golden light,
switched off when fireworks or illu-
minated waterworks had the stage. Farm
Cove was densely packed with small craft,
and seemed as busy as a little city when
the searchlights swept through its forest of
masts. Dozens of ferry-steamers hovered
about. A procession of gaily-illuminated
boats passed slowly and proudly. At the
end of the evening the Duke, watching
from G.H. grounds, saw his own linea-
ments outlined on an ebon background
in various brilliant hues and on a colossal
scale. Then a swart moon came up to
see the finish of the fun and take charge
of the illumination business for the rest
of the night.
H- H- V
At Sydney Cri. “Fresh Fields,” Ivor
Novello’s dig at parvenus and titled
ladies without a bean, is being given a
second run. Isabelle Mahon has replaced
Agnes Doyle in the part of Una Pidgeon,
the Australian flapper whose gaucheries
are so disturbing to her Belgravia hostess.
Miss Mahon has a brand of comedy of
her own which makes her treatment of
the part interesting. Grace Lane again
represents Lady Mary Crabbe, who is
reduced to the indignity of opening her
home to paying guests. Miss Lane’s
naturalness is one of the outstanding
features of the production. The part
of the languorous Lady Lilian is still in
the hands of Jane Wood, who gives a
lifelike picture of a muddle-headed aris-
tocrat grappling with the problems of
servant girls. As in the previous Sydney
production Harvey Adams’s typical Eng-
lish voice is sadly out of place in the
part he portrays—a rough diamond from
Bananaland. Gerald Savory could be
more alive as the superior young son,
but there is little to complain about the
acting of Katie Towers, who looks and
talks as if she had just stepped from be-
hind a Brisbane fourpenny bar. Kath-
leen Goodall, John Bedouin and Rita
Pauncefort again give good accounts of
themselves.

A sudden rage for Wagner induced
the Fullers to extend the Melbourne
Apollo season for a week, and its trust
was not misplaced. For the first night
of “Tannhauser” the audience over-
flowed into the aisles. If the production
fell somewhat short of the expectations
aroused by the ornate “Valkyrie” and
the exquisite “Tristan and Isolde,” the
fall did not amount to a major catas-
trophe, and by the second and third per-
formances orchestra and players had got
well into their stride. A Wagnerian
orchestra can be extended almost in-
definitely, but with his 45 conductor De
Abravanel produced a brilliant effect in
the overture.
The curtain went up and disclosed
Ben Williams Tannhauser in the arms of
Berna Stewart on a Venusberg hung with
gigantic icicles. Miss Stewart’s singing
was not quite equal to her appearance,
but Williams was forceful, persua-
sive and dignified as the philandering
knight. Frederick Collier endowed the
Landgrave of Thuringia with a majestic
bass in the second scene, and the min-
strel knights were considerably strength-
ened vocally owing to the importation of
Dutch tenor Sydney de Vries. In Act
11, the Hall of Song, Wagner showed
Verdi points in the matter of striking
spectacle, and producer Moor left no
wardrobe unransacked to realise the
composer’s aim. Thea Philips’s unso-

phisticated acting and her chaste and
pure soprano earned general sympathy
for Elizabeth when Tannhauser made his
ungentlemanly confession regarding his
behavior on the Venusberg.

Having forgotten the lesson Sir Hamil-
ton Harty taught it, Melbourne City
Council reverted to its custom of delug-
ing performers and audience with light
at the first episode of the Centenary
Music Festival on Saturday night. An-
other objection to the production of
Bach’s majestic B Minor Mass in the
Town Hall on Saturday was that the
voices of the soloists were lost in the
immense cave of the auditorium. In full
bay, in the “Gloria Excelsis,” the Festi-
val choir was magnificent, and it was
equally impressive in the other choruses ;
but it only served to throw further out
of balance the pipings of the soloists in
such sections as the “Domine Deus” and
the “Laudamus.” With the above reser-
vations the performance was a credit to
the conducting of George English, the
singing of the choir and the playing of
the symphony orchestra. A gem of

ABORIGINALITIES
“Wilga Willie”: Many stories were
told about Bill K., a recently departed
Bogansider. For one I can vouch.
Early in the 1920-21 season word got
about that crossbred wool was unsale-
able. “Why pay to take it off them?”
said Bill, whose sheep were all cross-
breds, as yet unshorn ; “I’ll leave mine
on the sheep’s backs till it can be sold.”
Next season, his class of staple having
vastly improved in prospects, Bill de-
cided to shear. But there was trouble
about pay, shearers maintaining that as
they had to take off two fleeces instead
of one they ought to get double rates.
“No fear!” said Bill. “I don’t want
you to take off two fleeces. Take off the
bottom one and that’ll do me.”
* * * *
“Banker”: The bush reference to
cheques “as big as a blanket” had no-
thing whatever to do with the size of
the paper on which the amount was
written. That was just the subtle humor
of us old bushmen referring to the size
of the amount, the figures, the value of
the thing when passed over the jump to
serve the proper purpose for which a
cheque is drawn.
* * * *
“Wang”: Dan had been kicked by
the colt, and was hopping about the yard
holding his wounded leg in one hand
and waving his other fist at the animal,
cursing it heedless of the approaching
parson. The playful neddy gave a snort
and another kick, and sent a. stick hurt-
ling across the yard that caught Dan
on the other leg, resulting in more acro-
batics and profanity. “Tut, tut, Dan,”
admonished the Church, “you should
exercise more re” “Exercise!” bel-
lowed Dan as he cavorted past again.
“Exercise! Stone th’ blanky crows, ain’t
what I’m doin’ enough exercise already?”
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: Queer how little things
can influence a man’s fortunes. Six
weeks ago I shifted an apiary from
winter quarters in the scrub to the open
forest country of Bordertown (S.A.). I
was feeling pretty tired by the time 1
came to the end of the trip and spent a
few minutes wondering whether I’d
better put them close to the road or go
to a better spot farther off in the pad-
dock. I decided to fight down the in-
clination to take the easiest course and
drove a bit farther. The worst tornado
in living memory went through the dis-
trict on Nov. 7, and the spot' where I
nearly unloaded the hives is now hidden
under fallen trees and limbs. Three hun-
dred yards away the hives stand un-
injured. Had I given way to that tired
feeling I’d now be moaning over the loss
of £lOO worth of bees and hives, to say
nothing of the honey they would have
brought in during the season.
* * * *
“Takupu”: The big yellow-headed
gannets are busy with their diving cir-
cuses all the way southabout from Bris-
bane round to Fremantle. These tem-
perate-climate fishers are curiously British
birds. With a few minor exceptions in
Iceland and the Faroes, all their breeding
places are situated within the British
Empire. Further, no self-governing
Dominion is without one of their great
family centres —Australian gannets choose
the islands in Bass Strait and the Bight
mostly. Fine spectacular divers, they
flash down with outspread wings like
a plunging aeroplane, disappearing in a
spout of spray and literally flying out of
the water with a capture. They have been
meshed in fishing-nets 100 ft. below the
surface. From the crosstrees of a be-
calmed schooner 1 have watched the
flash of their big white shapes darting and
turning after fish deep down in the clear
water. It is hard to believe that a large
bipj can perform such marvellous sub-
marine evolutions.
* * * *
“Groper”: Kingfish certainly swallow
live bait head first. Who hasn’t felt a
kingie fumbling a dead slice of fish look-
ing for the head? Snapper and jewfish
take a bait just anyhow; it isn’t even
necessary to cover the point of the hook ;
they grab across the belly part, discard-
ing tail and head. Cormorants or shags
can be seen any time swallowing fish
head first, even the painfully venomous
Westralian cobbler or catfish, the three
ivory spikes of which carry so much
THE ABO. PAR.
concentrated agony that even a light
prick will reduce most men nearly to
convulsions. Has anyone ever dissected a
cormorant’s gullet to see what it is lined
with —metal, leather, rubber or what?
* A- * *
“Como”: Melbourne backblockers are
now debating whether a horse—save a
circus horse —ever sits down. They
might next debate whether a horse ever
sings. The overwhelming opinion would
be to the contrary, yet I knew
a warbling prad at Violet Town (Vic.)
many years ago. With the local doctor,
1 drove out to a farm five miles from the
township, and, on pulling up at the gate,
we received a musical welcome from a
big bay who stopped grazing to eye us as
we entered. The moment the gate was
closed he lifted his head and sang—not
a horse-neigh, but full-throated head
notes, such as a giant contralto might
shake the welkin with. He had a beau-
tiful but untrained voice, that horse. His
ear was deficient, and he had no sense of
tune. In fact, I doubt if he was trying to
give us a real song. All he was doing
was to signify his approval of our
presence and let us know he was glad
to be alive. But sing he did.
* * * *
“Rindy”: The eternal triangle—this
time with four corners. Watched two
gentlemen sparrows act the public flagel-
lator on a lady bird whose morals, ap-
parently, had outraged sparrow decency.
Merciless in their punishment, and ob-
livious to the hysterical cries of the vic-
tim, they socked her good and hard.
Soon another gentleman appeared on the
scene ; he waded in as the gallant rescuer,
and in no time had finished the brawl.
Then, swelling with conceit and expect-
ing to receive her commendation, he
cottoned-up to the lady, only to be furi-
ously attacked in turn. He beat a dis-
gruntled retreat.
* * # *
“Inglegar”: Is this another matoa
species (B. 7/11 /’34)? A party at Rydal
(N.S.W.) discovered in the mould-filled
centre of an old stump a vividly beautiful
orchid-like flower about the size of an
Iceland poppy, a bright lemon in color,
with heavy splashes of rich reddish-brown.
A suitable container for forwarding to
the Government Botanist was hunted for,
but the box or tin which would restrain
that odor has yet to be made. A
harassed and apologetic postal official
refused to take charge of the package,
quoting postal regulations profusely.
The bloom had perforce to be given "a
decent burial because no hero was forth-
coming to lay the specimen on the ex-
pert’s doorstep.
* * *
“Nor’-wester”: Loss of a hand is
fairly common among the dynamite
fishermen of Westralia’s north-west,
where schools of fat mullet refuse to
take a baited hook. Some super-op-
timists have both members missing, they
having gone on tossing in the fracture
with the left hand after the right had
vanished. Carbide is safer than dyna-
mite. Get a soda-water bottle with a
glass-alley stopper and rubber ring.
Load with a tablespoonful of carbide,
then about half a cup of water. Reverse
bottle instantly to seal, and drop over-
board. Before it gets to the bottom
sufficient gas will be generated to shatter
the glass and shock most of the fish in
the vicinity. Not so effective as dyna-
mite, of course, but a darned sight safer.
* * * *
“Enemcue”: I wonder how many
young birds do overtime in the nursery.
A pair of house swallows have built over
my window for the last two seasons.
During the second term of housekeeping
I found that when it was long past the
time when the whole family should have
been flying south (or it is north?) food
was still being brought to a lusty young-
ster. Investigation showed that he was
held by the leg to the lining of the nest.
It took a razor-blade to free him, and
he winged away like a veteran.

“Scrofa”: Encouraged, possibly, by
the fact that a Queenslander has been
elected president of the Fed-
eral Council of Stud Pig
Breeders, a sow at Wiyarra
(Q.) has performed a remark-
able feat of self-surgery. She
was found apparently dying,
with marks of a snakebite on
one leg. Her litter of 10 was
removed, and the lady left
to depart in peace. Next
morning she was still alive.
She had ripped open the
wound with her tusks, and
the resultant flow of blood
had drained off the venom.
A couple of days later she
was fully recovered and at-
tending as usual to the family
needs.
* * *
“R. de C.”: On Tas-
mania’s wet west coast I
traced to their eyrie two
“golden-headed” (wedge-
tailed) eagles and took up a
position on the opposite side
of a gully seven or eight
hundred feet deep, hoping
that one or both of the birds
would decide to inspect me
and thus give me the chance
of a shot. Instead, after a
short time, one of the birds
left the nest with a fledgling
on its back. It soared to a
considerable height, then
neatly tipped the youngster
into mid-air. Just as I was
preparing to scramble down
in anticipation of capturing
the eaglet, dead or alive, the
parent bird swooped below
and caught it neatly on its
back. This performance was
repeated several times, and
presently the second parent
appeared with two young-
sters and proceeded to juggle
them in a similar manner.
Since the country in this
vicinity (near Mt. Bischoff)
was very heavily timbered,
and the eagles were birds
with a wing-span of seven
or eight feet, this was appa-
rently the only way they
could teach their fledglings
to fly.
* * *
“De Bee”: In spite of the
mechanisation of labor even
in country districts and the
many changes in the human
outlook, young Australia is
still resourceful in the bush
—sometimes recklessly re-
sourceful. Recently noticed
a boy trapper who had im-
provised a conveyance for
carrying his traps out of a
forked sapling, a box and a
pair of small wheels, and
hooked it on behind his saddle-horse.
In the bush a station-hand almost ran
for safety on seeing the lad coming at
a canter with the trailer rattling along
behind.

“Veega”: Some years ago I used to
pass my Bulletin to an abo. camp on
the station where I rode the boss’s horses
and ate his tucker. A new picaninny
arriving, I asked what his name was to
be. “Mine can’t say it, boss,” replied
the gin. “P’r’aps some day mission pfeller
teach him. Mine show it you.” Dis-
appearing into the wurlie, she emerged
with an out-of-date Bully opened at
the “Shows” page, and proudly exhibited
the picture of a celebrated actor with a
double-barrelled French cognomen. Such
is fame and abo. nomenclature.
RUS IN URBE.
Tis springtime on the housetops now,
The time of bliss and bustle.
When starlings look for loosened tiles,
And sparrows study building styles,
And love the languid dove beguiles
To stir itself and hustle.
Straw mattresses and feather beds,
Above the chimneys carried,
Go by aerial express,
Hand-gallop, to a new address.
Heads bob in every roof recess;
And couples scarcely married,
But all agog to settle down
To life’s domestic labors,
Are making love amidst the leaves,
Inspecting flats beneath the eaves,
Purloining withered grass in sheaves
And squabbling with their neighbors.
They have no time to rhapsodise
On love, like human gabies;
Housekeeping treads on courtship's heel,
And fast the pretty eggs reveal
The mouths, agape for one long meal,
Of a whole batch of babies,
Who soon are feathered, flown and gone.
Then presently there follows
Hn “Avian Ads.”): “To sell or let
Snug pise villa; kitchenette;
High situation; free of debt;
Vacated by the swallows.”

“Walga”: To say there is no love lost
between Macksville and Bowraville
(Nambucca River, N.S.W.) is to praise
them for their happy relations. Macks-
ville’s “late” shopping day is Friday;
Bowraville’s is Saturday. Recently a
motor service between Macksville and
the seaside village of Nambucca Heads
was inaugurated. Macksville decided to
subsidise the ’bus to run a trip on Fri-
days from Bowraville. Bowraville smiled
grimly. When the ’bus arrived a full
load of abos. from the settlement' near
the town was ready for a trip down
river, fares provided. Thus the curiosity
of the Macksville folk as to how many
passengers would avail themselves of the
service and how much they would bring
with’ them was soon satisfied. Before the
homeward trip was commenced the de-
scendants of our first inhabitants were
regaled, at Bowraville’s expense, with
saveloys and ice-cream. The simple
children of Nature left for home bliss-
fully content; but no one is quite sure
yet which town is “one up.”

“Shiggs”: The man who was kicked by
a dead bullock in a N. S. Wales country
town the other day and taken to hospi-
tal may consider himself an unlucky
cuss, but it might, have been a lot worse.
1 had a mate once who was bitten —
fatally—by a dead snake. He was root-
ing around at the bottom of an old
shaft when the fang of a long-dead
wriggler broke the skin of his hand:
the poison worked far quicker than that
of any live snake. The why of it is
beyond me.
* * *
“Zed Kew”: “De Bee” asks (B.
24/10/’34) if there is anything artists
draw so frightfully as an axe. There is—
the atrocity they call a saddle. I would
undertake to use an artist’s axe to chop
enough wood to boil a billy; but I’d be
double-twisted and then some more if
ever I’d put one of their saddles on a
horse’s back and ride on it.

“Wang”: Susie Pinknales took a job
in a country store, and came back
to town enlightened about the free-
and-easy ways of the bush. One day a
“We draw the color-line."
huge man walked up to the counter,
and, without embarrassment, said, “I
want a pair o’ stays fer me ole woman.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Susie, blinking a bit;
“what size does your wife take?”
“Cripes! I forget,” he answered.
“She tole me all right, too.” Sud-
denly he brightened. “Gimme a
piece of string, miss—a good long bit,”
he asked. Then he hurried outside. He
was back in a minute or two, and formed
a circle on the counter with the string.
“That’s a very, large size,” said Sue, as
she gazed at the diameter of the circle.
“That’s th’ size I want, anyway, miss,”
hubby replied. “I’ve jist measured her.”
“Your wife, sir?” the girl queried. “Wife?
No,” he replied, “I’ve jist measured th’
ole mare outside there. Th’ missus is jist
about a foot less than her round th’
brisket.”

“Jimmac”: Re that lightning-stricken
tree on the Bogan (N.S.W.) that white-
ants wouldn’t look at (B. 7/11/’34). !
Along the banks of that river grows
a light pine (don’t know the species)
which termites never touch in any case.
Other trees immune from these destroyers
are gidya and Cooktown ironwood.
* * * *
“Lugger’s Mate”: The seahorse, small
as it is, is a warty mass of spines and
roughness that gives one handling it
a bad time. Perhaps it is this that gen-
erates the mighty bellyache of “Larra-
pinta’s” shags (B. 31/10/’34) once
they’ve got the ugly little devils into
their works. Or it may be the defensive
secretion that the spines exude. I would
as readily swallow a stone-fish or a spiny
urchin as a seahorse ; and I guess the
shag feels that way afterwards, too.
* * * *
“Eck de Sulzbach”: The agility of the
flea (B. 31 /10/’34) is somewhat over-
rated. More than 300 years ago Galileo
disproved the notion that if a flea were
the same size as man it would be able
to jump 1000 feet into the air. But the
idea sticks. The increase in size (neglect-
ing air resistance) would not bring about
a corresponding increase in jumping
power because the height to which any
animal can leap is more nearly indepen-
dent of its size than proportional to it.
The important factor is the efficiency of
the jumping muscles, and in this respect
man is the superior. Otherwise the
ability to hop six feet in the air would
be added to the insect’s already terrific
advantages.
# * * *
“Mundowie”: Denizens of far-northern
waters often grow to huge sizes, and
among them is the giant prawn. Its
abiding place is the Mitchell River (Q.),
where the tasty crustaceans grow to a
length of 12in. and weigh up to a couple
of pounds. One prawn is a meal for a
gourmand. But the giants are not easy
to catch. They live in rock crevices, and,
though they can be lured forth to nibble
at a baited hook, they let go at the first
pull on the line and scuttle back under
cover. A common way of hooking them
is to jag them underneath. The abos.
catch them in cylinder-shaped cane
traps, closed at one end. To get one of
the big fellows Binghi will sometimes
wait and watch for hours.
* * $ *
“Veega”: Flinder’s estimate of one
flock of 132,000,000 petrels (B. 7/11*34)
reminds me of a never-to-be-forgotten
sight at our camp on an anabranch of
the Darling (N.S.W.) in the drought year
of 1928. Just before sunset a flock of
galahs put in an appearance, coming
from the west. When the head of the
column began to land the rear was still
at an estimated distance of five miles, a
grey cloud averaging three-quarters of a
mile wide against a cloudless sky. The
box-trees by the creek took on the ap-
pearance of profuse blossoming, and the
din was indescribable. Seems to me old
Noah must have had a dud tally clerk
when he loaded up his ark —if one com-
pares the present-day members of some
species against others and considers that
they all started from scratch.

“Torquata”: Many bush people main-
tain that the quandong fruits in alternate
years, but they are wrong. Every year
the quandong produces fruit, but some
years, owing to lack of pollination by
bees or abnormal seasons, the crop either
fails or is small. Parasitic by nature,
the tree doesn’t suffer much from
drought. The shallow roots travel long
distances in search of the roots of hosts.
When one is found a bell-shaped suc-
torial disc is placed upon the host and
the sap supplies are diverted to the quan-
“What make you run after t’at pakeha woman, Timi? Her looks?”
“No, yours"
dong. Sometimes when drought prevails
the parasite kills the surrounding small
trees and is thrown back upon its own
resources, when it can live quite com-
fortably. Fruit of the quandong takes
about nine months to develop from
the heavily-scented insignificant flowers,
which are borne in December and
January.

“Billy See”: “Porcupine Joe” (B.
24/9/’34) needn’t have gone to a German
cook to learn the effectiveness of burying
bush-game to make it more palatable.
In Victoria, 40 years ago, we always
buried the ’possums overnight to rid
them of the gummy taste.
* * * %
“Speargrass”: Twenty-odd years back
I went to the Springsure district (C.Q.).
with the reputation of being a
horseman. I busted that and
several teeth. On the station
honored with my presence I
was overseer and book-keeper,
telegraph master and dog-
poisoner, head butcher, head
musterer and the head’s dog to
kick if anything went wrong.
I had to play tennis with the
guests and cards with the boss
and his missus; I had to be
nice to sweet young things and
hand out pints of flour to
travellers. I fell in love,
popped and rode the clouds. I
had three fights with an equal
number of wins and losses —one
was a draw. I was chased by a
wild-boar pig and a ditto
female cook ; was trapped in a
well and thought I was going
to die. Didn’t. Got bushed.
Found myself. Broke an arm
and my engagement, and cleared out.
That, in addition to carrying on with the
usual work, all took place within three
months.
* * * *
“Y.0.Y.”: We hear of fast- and slow-
growing grasses, but how’s this for a fast-
growing tree? A red-gum, culled from
the Westralian bush as a shoot Ift. high,
was planted in a heap of sweepings from
the fowlhouse. Four years later it stood
9ft. high; now, five years old, it
measures 18ft.
* * * *
“Wagga”: Restriction of family cares
is even finding its way to the farm these
days. On a place near Albury (N.S.W.)
the other day a mare gave birth to two
foals. The idea of twins didn’t appeal
to the lady’s finer senses at all; she
treated one of the pair in a most uu-
motherly way, lashing out at it vigor-
ously whenever it demanded maternal
attention, although she lavished all care,
on the other. The unwanted one died,
in spite of efforts made to feed it.
* * * *
“Airline”: Talking of cheap sprees,
one at Julia Creek (n.-w. Q.) takes a lot of
beating. A fire destroyed one of the local
pubs, but a Frigidaire plant directly over
the cellar saved the contents to a large
extent. While the ashes were still smould-
ering a large party of train-hoppers
swept down on the ruins at dead of
night, and after some enthusiastic pros-
pecting located the swag. It would be
hard to say how much they got, but a
scene of desolation greeted the dawn.
Dead marines of all varieties strewed
the town, the railway yards and the sur-
rounding plains, and the police were
busy hunting half-demented bagmen on
to passing trains to get rid of them.
* * * *
“Simpering Jane”: The kookaburra is
not a national bird in the sense that the
peewee, ground lark, wagtail and emu
are. Jack is rarely found off part of the
coastal watershed and is not indigenous
to Westralia. During three years I heard
one, and one only, on the Alice River,
on the Barcoo side. I never heard one
on the Thompson, Diamantina, Hamilton,
Burke or Wills.
* * * *
“Endyar”: “Sydney Absentee” (B.
7/11/ ’34) mentions the Victorian butcher-
bird’s careful habit of sticking birds and
mice on the twigs of pear-trees. To see
the bloodthirsty fowl at his butcheriest
you should go up to North Queensland,
where certain trees growing handy spikes
make a gory paradise for the feathered
slaughterer. It’s not uncommon to see
dozens of tiny victims impaled on the
spikes of a single tree —usually referred
to as a butcher’s shop—saved up for a
rainy day.
Hi St * *
“I. C. Dem”: “Elaps” (B. 7/11/’34) is
right when he says there is no such thing
as a legged snake when first hatched.
But there are 14 species of lizards with-
out legs, two of which occur in New
Guinea. They grow to about 24in., are
non-venomous, but are often killed as
snakes. They are about as thick as a
fountain-pen, and are of varied bright
hues. They differ from snakes in several
respects, having a thick, fleshy tongue,
eyelids composed of a circular, scaly ring,
a distinct ear-opening (the snake has
none visible), and two small scaly flaps,
one on each side of the body, about
a third of the distance from the head to
the tailtip. The head is usually pointed.
They lay eggs —long oval ones, with
parchment-like covers —usually placing
them in decaying stumps or under logs,
then covering them with debris.
KURRAJONGS.
I’ll give you all your box and gum,
Pine, mulga, mallee, river-oak,
And wattle where the wild bees hum
Within a fragrant, golden cloak.
I’ll give you all the myall’s bloom,
The quandong’s harvest apple-red,
And where, amid the ridges’ gloom,
The ironbarks their blossoms shed.
But, where they all exhausted lie
Beneath the noon sun’s hot caress,
The kurrajongs still stir and sigh,
Indifferent, cool and passionless.
Among the glossy leaves that screen
Their gambols from the prying glance
Down airy aisles of golden green
One still may feel the breezes dance.
A shapely tree of habit neat
In emeralds and olives drest,
On which in days of glare and heat
The sun-tired eye delights to rest
While summer noontide lags along;
The coolest shade the bushman knows
Lies where some sturdy kurrajong
Its trembling patch of shadow throws.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND'S
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
BLOWFLY-TRAPS.
“Tarboy”: “Albarmount” (B. 7 /11 / ’34)
says “traps have not been thoroughly
tested out” and “.... it would be neces-
sary to enforce their use over an area of
at least 100 miles square.”
On Dalmally (Q.), where the special
Blowfly Committee operated, they were
considered early in the experiments.
Many kinds of traps were submitted
to the committee, and one of the double
petrol-tin variety caught flies by the hun-
dred million.
We had a battery of 25 in a thousand-
acre paddock. Yet we found that there
was no diminution in the number of
“struck” sheep in that paddock com-
pared with other paddocks unfurnished
with traps.
This class of trap was manufactured
and sold in thousands in all the sheep
districts of the State. Within 12 months
reports had come in that the traps caught
flies in myriads, but there was no abate-
ment of the pest. We tried them for
over two years.
It is worth recording a curious thing
about our traps. At a weekly clearing
we found a number had ceased to catch
flies. All traps were baited with bullock-
liver, which we found, after repeated ex-
periment', to be the best bait. On pull-
ing the traps apart we found that spiders
had spun webs across the inlet passage
and thus effectually prevented access to
the bait chamber.
The chief offender in a fly season is
the primary fly, Lucilia sericata. The
“hairy” maggot fly ( Chrysomia albiceps )
preys on the larvae of Lucilia, and is thus
the greatest enemy of the fly which starts
the mischief. The trap doesn’t discrimi-
nate, but catches all sorts.
It may be a hint to the biologists if
they were asked to concentrate on a lure
which will attract Lucilia and leave
Chrysomia, the cannibal, to continue his
good work.
PERIODIC FLY ATTACKS.
“Albarmount”: I grant that sick and
concertina-breeched sheep are more sus-
ceptible to fly attack; but if such sheep
were “the supreme factor” in avoid-
ing strikes, as “Warramulla” says (B.
14/11/’34), the fly menace could easily
be overcome. As a matter of fact, the
blowies are much more pestilent on
the sound central-west plains of N.S.W.
than in the sour, wormy country.
In normal seasons flies cause few
deaths and give no great amount of
trouble, as crutching and the like is then
usually effective. But when they are
abnormally bad, and even crossbred
wethers succumb to their attack, losses
are heavy and labor costs high.
It is to combat these extra-severe
ravages, which are becoming too fre-
quent, that all efforts should be directed.
PIECE-PICKING.
“Toowong”: I use a method of dealing
with the skirtings that is as applicable to
a board of 40 shearers as to one of four.
When the fleece is thrown on the
table by a picker-up the woolroller
takes off the stained pieces, putting them
into a basket at the end of the table.
Then the fatty points are trimmed off
and the pieces and broken fleece removed
and also placed in a basket, leaving the
fleece clean and ready to be rolled.
It will be seen that the pieces, too, are
clean sorts.
Boiled down, it means that the wool-
rollers are required to skirt three times.
Of course, the operation is slower, but
the ordinary piece-pickers are used as
woolrollers. In practice about the same
number of men is required in the wool-
room as in the common method of mix-
ing the pieces on the floor and then “un-
mixing” them at a distant table. One
great advantage of my method is that
the whole operation is directly under the
eye of the woolclasser.
Every classer knows that often, when
the pieces from the tables have accumu-
lated beyond the capacity of the piece-
pickers to clear, the men are tempted to
take a few armfuls and throw them into
the bin unsorted.
My way, the sweeper around the tables
can look after the baskets. There can-
not be any accumulation of pieces un-
sorted. The classer knows that there is
no wholesale slumming when his back
is turned; and it does not cost an extra
penny-piece. One or two days suffice to
break-in a newchum at the tables while
really good piece-pickers are scarce.
THE LEARNER PROBLEM.
“Jumbuck”: “Patrick’s” remarks (B.
31/10/’34) on the way in which shearing
contractors scout the award clause that
implies the employment of a percentage
of learners touch a serious problem.
The shearer shortage that “Patrick”
complains of becomes greater as time
goes on. Owners themselves are to
blame in many cases. There are some
who curse every time they see a learner
walk on to the board.
Contractors sidestep the learner for
obvious reasons.
I once saw the learner’s pen given to a
shearer who “rung” the shed. Often in
sheds run by contractors the “learners”
are as good as the average shearer.
TWIN-LAMB DISEASE.
“B-gar”: Losses amongst ewes heavy
in lamb may often be diagnosed as due
to excess fat. The condition brings about
a form of paralysis which now bears
the name of Twin-lamb Disease in some
districts.
Observation of the ewes near lambing
is essential. Rich artificial fodder during
drought must be avoided. Much safer
to have the ewes light in condition than
bordering on primeness. Plenty of exer-
cise is necessary. Where ewes are being
artificially fed, the fodder must be dis-
tributed at a reasonable distance from
water.
Symptoms of the disease occur at any-
thing up to three weeks before lambing.
Affected ewes become sluggish, refuse
to feed and isolate themselves. Then
they will not move. They may remain
in this condition for four or five days
before dying.
No known effective treatment has been
discovered. Only preventive measures
are any good. See that ewes get plenty
of exercise to and from pastures and
water, provide them with a reliable lick,
and if feed is plentiful yard them for
periods rather than allow them to be-
come too fat.
“PINK-EYE.”
“Mercury”: “Sorghum’s” success with
zinc sulphate as a cure among sheep (B.
7/11/’34) was the opposite to mine when
treating cattle. Home remedies proved
better than zinc sulphate, and the best
remedy I have tried is powdered alum,
which “Sorghum” condemns as cruel.
If animals are saved from the weeks
of torture which come with the advanced
stages of ophthalmia by the alum treat-
ment, surely its use is an act of mercy.
I have treated dairy cows in the worst
stage of the disease, a huge ulcer cover-
ing the eye and literally protruding from
the eye-socket. Alum cleaned up the
trouble. The sight was always saved.
In the Upper Clarence Valley a neigh-
bor had half his herd of about 100 Cows
in a bad way, some so utterly blind that
they had to be watered by hand. It took
21b. of alum, to cure the herd, and I am
sure he would grin broadly if he read
“Sorghum’s” pronouncement.
WET, COLD AND FEED.
“Henry L.”: A cold snap is tough on
new-shorn sheep. With rain added it
is worse. If they come from the pens
new-shorn and with empty bellies there
will be anything up to 100 per cent,
mortality.
Moral: If there is rain coming get
the sheep out of the pens as soon as
possible and give them a chance to stoke
up and keep their body heat. If possible,
don’t let them huddle and pack together,
even though the warmth generated by
the mob might be some comfort to the
units. It is better to keep them feeding.
I saw a striking instance in ’26 of
what can happen to weak sheep. The
day’s shearing—Boo-odd—met a storm
just as they left the yards. They were
wethers, the strongest in the flock, but
not more than 50 of them answered the
roll in the morning. Under almost simi-
lar conditions, I saw an equal number
of ewes get the same treatment, but
they had the product of an hour’s feed-
ing inside. With odd exceptions, the old
girls came prancing out of the brake in
the morning.
MORE SILAGE TECHNIQUE.
“Aerogenes”: “Stump Jump” states
(B. 14/11 /’34) that it is important to cut
and puli the strings off the bundles of
oats as they are put into a silage pit.
I submit that these are better left on.
We have made stack silage from
bound green oats, leaving all the strings
in position. On opening up, the strings
were mostly in good condition, and were
very useful in handling.
We handled the bundles to a chaff-
cutter, where the strings were cut and
the oats chaffed with lucerne hay. The
silage has to be firm to allow this to
be done, and it must be mixed with the
dry hay to be chaffed successfully.
The difference between feeding silage
and feeding dry feed to dairy cows when
there is no green feed is shown in the
increased fat returns.
I have estimated that when the milkers
are depending entirely on hand-feeding
the change from the ration of 201 b. of
lucerne chaff to the one of 101 b. of
lucerne chaff and 201 b. of silage has in-
creased the fat yield 100 p.c.
My lucerne chaff costs about £1 per
ton and my ensilage 10s. per ton to pro-
duce on the farm ; and I value the butter-
fat at Bd. per pound.
Feeding lucerne only, 100 cows eat
about one ton a day, costing £l. They
return about 501 b. butter-fat, bringing me
335., margin over feed costs being 13s.
Feeding lucerne and ensilage, 100 cows
eat one ton of ensilage and half a ton of
lucerne, costing £l. They return about
1001 b. butter-fat, bringing me 665., the
margin over feed costs being £2 6s.
“West”: “Stump Jump” says (B.
14/11/’34) that lucerne in dry belts is
worth while only in rare seasons, and
then “only gives a thin first-cut and
scrubby aftergrowth.” That’s a fallacy
long exploded. Ken Gault, at Trundle
(N.S.W.) (is that dry enough?) grows
lucerne from which he gets three cuts a
year and good grazing, and there are
numerous others. It’s a matter of know-
ing how to sow it. “Stump Jump” should
try 31b. to the acre, with wheat as a
cover crop, and the amount of super, per
acre usually sown with the wheat. If
the season is good enough to bring the
wheat up, he will find himself with a
good lucerne stand.
PH A LARIS BULBOSA.
“Rich J.”; “Atriplex” (B. 7/11/’34)
mentions Phalaris as a pasture, but it is
also a wonderful haymaker. It should
be cut as soon as the flower heads form,
and should yield 6-8 tons of hay with no
difficulty.
As a pasture, it is perhaps the great-
est winter fodder plant of them all on
account of its frost-resisting qualities
and the fact that it is less selective of
soil and rainfall than, say, perennial rye.
Its deep-rooted growth was shown re-
cently at Gippsland in the Curran
Swamp, where A. F. Wilson has 100
acres of it. The root system was traced
to a dense mass Bft. from the surface.
It seems to thrive everywhere on the
coast and tableland, and in the cooler
areas will give feed practically all the
year round. In grazing trials conducted
at Glen Innes (N.S.W.), over a period of
four years, Phalaris bulbosa carried 2\
sheep to the acre without a spell, and
stock grew fatter and bigger than those
on native grasses carrying one sheep
per acre.
January to May is the time for sowing
at the rate of 51b. per acre. If mixed
with other grasses, English yellow trefoil
should be included, together with white
or sub.-clovers.
PASTURE IMPROVEMENT.
“Hortus”: Dairy-farmers whose winter
output is low should study the pasture
results obtained at the Grafton (N.S.W.)
Experiment Farm.
The peculiar point about N.S.W. N.
Coast low production has been that the
paddocks, which are almost all of pas-
palum, appear to be carrying sufficient
feed.' It is neither nutritious nor milk-
producing.
The following scheme was tried:
About 50 acres of ordinary paspalum
country was divided into paddocks of
about eight acres each, and the surface
worked during the autumn with a
renovator carrying rather fine points.
This relieved the sodbound condition of

BRITISH SCIENTISTS AMAZING
HEALTH DISCOVERY
OF VITAL CONCERN TO SUFFERERS FROM CONSTITUTIONAL AILMENTS AND NERVOUS DISORDERS
. . . ASTOUNDING TRIUMPH OVER OLD-AGE INFIRMITIES.
Remarkable New Method of Drugless Healing Promises Better Health and Longer Life.
OVER 4500 AUSTRALIAN USERS HAVE
ALREADY OBTAINED WONDERFUL RESULTS
If ever a man was entitled to speak with
authority on the subject of health restoration
that man is Mr. O. Overbeck, F.C.S., F.P.C.
(Lond.), the well-known scientist. For to-
day, at 74 years of age, Mr. Overbeck has the
bloom of health, the muscular strength, the
buoyant vitality, the contagious optimism of
a young man, and he owes his present con-
dition entirely to a health process which he
discovered and began to put into practice at
a time when he was such a complete physical
wreck that his doctor told him to make his
will, as he had not long to live.
A ROMANCE OF HEALTH
RECOVERY.
Mr. Overbeck’s recovery of health and
vigor is, indeed, an astonishing romance.
A year or two before the discovery that
made such an amazing change in his life he
used to spend most of his days stretched out
on a sofa. It was painful to see him climb-
ing the staircase to his bedroom on the first
floor—a step and a rest, a step and a rest,
lest this slight exertion should bring on a
heart attack.
His piano, upon which he had so often
improvised with masterly execution for the
entertainment of his friends, was all but
silent now, for the effort of playing even the
briefest and least exacting of pieces was too
much for him. As for any really active
pleasures, they had to be entirely abandoned.
A devoted horticulturist, he no longer dared
to stoop over his beloved plants, and the
glass houses, where he had raised seine of
the rarest plants to be found in Great Britain,
knew his care no longer. On the rare occa-
sions when he went for a walk in his home
town of Grimsby, his halting gait and haggard
looks were marked by all his friends, who
fully shared his doctor’s opinion of the out-
come of his illness.
Mr. Overbeck was, in fact, a prematurely
aged man, with an old man’s sallow skin and
faded eyes, an old man’s infirmities and
maladies, the victim of chronic kidney trouble
and rheumatism, his hair scanty, his sight
blurred, his pulse feeble and erratic.
But, physically broken down as he was, he
still retained the mental outlook, at least,
of the trained man of science, and
a brain that for years had spent its energies in
tackling all kinds of difficult and exacting
problems now turned to the most vital prob-
lem of all —how the fires of life, which so
obviously were dying down, could be stoked
up again, and stirred into a cheerful blaze.
THE SECRET OF YOUTH.
He began experimenting, and before long
he was convinced that he had discovered the
real secret of youth, in a new process of cell
rejuvenation. In the true spirit of the scien-
tist, he tried his process on himself. Some
mistakes had to be corrected. Then one day
he was faced with the startling realisation that
his pulse was definitely stronger and more
regular, his step firmer, his sight clearer.
Gradually his hair began to grow thicker,
too; the twinges of rheumatic pain subsided
more and more, the kidney trouble vanished,
and his whole outlook on life changed. In
short, he was a new man, and friends who
met him in the street were flabbergasted by
the change which had taken place in his
appearance, for, instead of the stooping, woe-
begone figure they had glanced at furtively
with a shake of the head, they saw before
them a man with a firm, elastic stride, and
that fiery glint in the eye which proclaims
an eager, active brain.
FROM DECREPITUDE TO
VIGOR.
At the Savoy Hotel, London, Mr. Overbeckl
announced his discovery to an enthusiastic
audience, including medical men. In the
chair on this momentous occasion was Mr.
W. J. Womersley, M.P., Grimsby, who
vouched for the accuracy of photographs of
Mr. Overbeck taken before he began his new
rejuvenating treatment. These showed Mr.
Overbeck as a decrepit old man, whereas
the Mr. Overbeck who stood upon the plat-
form was seen to be a well-set-up and vigorous
specimen of humanity, to all appearances
many years younger.
After this public announcement of his dis-|
covery, it was no longer possible for Mr.
Overbeck to ignore the demands of the
numerous sufferers who urged him to make
available for others the health process whicl
had so unexpectedly and so completely re
established his own health and renewed hi;
youth.
Mr. Overbeck accordingly made arrange -
ments so that this growing demand migl t
be met, and his “Rejuvenator,” as he aptly
termed the means whereby he had recovered
youth and health, is now doing for othe: s
what it has done for Mr. Overbeck himsel'.
It is banishing the infirmities of age. It is
renewing the waning vital energy and r;-
storing youthful enthusiasm in the middl :-
aged and elderly. It is making old arteri ;s
young again. It is toning up vital organs th at
have become “tired” and sluggish. It is
winning back for thousands who have lost it
the will to win the battle of life, the zest
for action, the desire to lead instead of to
follow.

provement in Mr.

THE BOON OF ROBUST
HEALTH.
Upon men and women of naturally weak
constitution at any age it is conferring the
priceless boon of robust health and vigor,
while athletes, actors, singers, organisers and*
others who are obliged to work at fever pitch j
all the time find in it the most certain j
means of banishing fatigue and keepings
always at the top of their form.
These are astonishing claims, but they are
borne out in the fullest detail by the deeply
grateful reports received by every post from
those who have followed the example of
Mr. Overbeck.
A few such reports are printed on this
page for the benefit of readers of this paper.
Many others, bearing the full names and

Mr. Overbeck’s new health process, by
means of which all the cells in the body
are recharged with energy, the muscles
strengthened, the circulation improved, the
vital organs toned up, and the whole system

ling book, the reading of which has for many

Dear Sir, —I am
pleased to say that
the Overbeck has
done me a wonder-
ful lot of good. I
was a chronic suf-
ferer of Constipa-
tion, also Arthritis
in a very bad form,
Indigestion, Head-

Constipation nearly
corrected and Liver i
trouble greatly re-
duced. I may state
I have not had anyi
sign of a cold since
ysing the Overbeck.

NERVOUS TROUBLE
SCREAMED IN AGONY.
Cremorne, 20/9/’34.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in writing
to inform you of my benefit from the Re-
juvenator.
As you are aware, I suffered from Rheuma-
toid Arthritis and acute nervous trouble.
The pain in my shoulder was so ex-
cruciating that I simply screamed with any
movement of my arm; also 1 could not bear
to touch the flesh.
The hospital I was attending closed down
for a month, so I could not get Diathermy.
1 saw the Overbeck advertised in a maga-
zine, and in desperation bought one.
To-day my arm is normal. I can use it
as well as ever I could. I say with all my
heart the Overbeck is worth its weight in
gold. I will gladly recommend it to any
sufferer. Especially is it good for nerves.

RHEUMATISM AND SCIATICA.
40 Phillips Street, Somerton,
Glenelg, S.A.
Dear Sir, —I have used the Model daily
since I received it twelve months ago, and
it has cured me completely of rheumatism and
sciatica. It has also increased the growth of
my hair, which was getting rather thin, but
there has been no appreciable alteration in
the color of the hair, nor in the erasing of
wrinkles.
One thing more —I have not had a cold
since using the instrument; no indigestion,
unless I feed on things which have always
disagreed with me, and even those foods, such
as onions, fats, curries, sausages—which were
always anathema to my stomach —I can now
eat in strict moderation.
Constipation, too, has been banished, and
I have not taken an aperient for over ten
months.
With sincere good wishes, I remain,
Yours very truly,
( Sgd.) P. W. FRANCIS.
INSOMNIA, ANAEMIA; HAIR.
38 John Street, Cottesloe, W.A.
Dear Sir, —I have now had the Overbeck
for about five months. I consider it a won-
derful little battery. Its use has done me a
lot of good, inducing sleep, and proved a
great help for anaemia by massaging the
epigastric nerves.
It has also benefited the hair growth of the
head. You may make use of my name.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) CONSTANCE H. HORROCKS.

O
FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which Is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

production from the same number of
cows in February was 12791 b. butter.
This was a remarkable increase, as the
peak month of the year was normally
February, and this year the latter month
received its normal rainfall.
The average monthly butter return for
June and July, 1932 and 1933, was 11131 b.
from 53 cows, whereas in the same
months this year, when the cows were
on the improved pastures, the return was
13751 b. butter from 53 animals —an in-
crease of 2621 b. a month.
That the increase was due to the
changed composition of the pastures was
clearly demonstrated when the herd was
removed from the treated areas to the
good average paspalum country which
had not been renovated. An immediate
drop of 30 gallons of milk per day from
the herd resulted.
VALUE OF HERD-TESTING
“Stump Jump”: I allow “Bahb Dwyer”
(B. 7/11 /’34) that the cow-farmer can be
“shrewd and competent,” but I have
never known one to take on line breed-
ing from his Babcock results unless he
had pure-breds. Yet with grades accord-
ing to theory it should be a hundred
times more valuable. And few dairymen
understand line breeding. Most believe
it is only another name for inbreeding,
and there the matter ends.
I still maintain that ability developed
by experience is the main item in picking
Strawberry. No man could write a com-
plete definition of how to do the job.
It’s an ingrained faculty which makes
the difference between a good and bad
breeder.
Three men I’ve known topped their
local herd tests for two years at
least, and never bred an animal in their
herds. They used their innate judgment
to pick at sight what other people bred,
keeping at the same time the Babcock
test to verify their judgment.
At the same time I can give many
examples of men who had bred from the
test result for generations and tailed off
the competition lists. The test is nearly
useless without the ability to use it. Other
men 1 knew were ruined buying cows
from tested dams.
The most glaring example I know was
of a man who had the champion test herd
of his State. He knew how to feed and
pick milkers, and bred religiously from
the test records. He introduced no fresh
blood, being content with the progeny
of his good animals. That worked well
until the third and fourth generations
appeared, when his signal disregard of
type presented him with the queerest set
of cows I have ever seen —so queer in the
bucket that the auctioneer got them.
I will grant that an unlovely animal
may be a butter-fat mine, but she may
also be an accident, and as such unable
to transmit her characteristics. Some
females are prepotent for six generations
and others for none. Success seems to
lie entirely in “cow sense” —and few
have it.
CHILLED BEEF.
“Rich. J.”: Those who advocate the
breeding of bull beef with dairy cows
menace the future of our export trade.
Although, in exceptional cases, a good
beef breed has been produced from a
beef and dairy cross, it is obvious that
the average cross falls far short of the
demands of Smithfield.
Another objection is that not every
calf is a bull, and crossbred beef-milk
heifers are not worth their pasture to
the dairyman. Also, an export trade
supplied with odd dairy lots is going to
fail in consistency of weight and quality.
The suggestion that a good beef type
can be evolved from dairy cattle is quite
true, but the process of changing takes
many generations. It is absurd to waste
time and fodder breeding crosses when
we have established beef breeds such as
Herefords, Shorthorns, etc.
If we are to succeed in the English
market, we must work on a scale pro-
portionate to the opportunities offered.
The Stuart Star’s shipment of 500 tons
was a graziers’ shipment, and it is to the
graziers that we must look to develop
the market type.
A FARM CONCRETE-MIXER,
“Kojonup”: Here’s a handy concrete-
mixer simply made out of an old 44-
gallon petrol-drum. Its use does away
with the toil associated with the shovel.
Cut your drum with a sharp cold-
chisel lengthways from top to bottom.
Then cut in along top . and bottom
rims a sufficient distance to allow a flap
to be turned in to the centre of the drum
—about llin. Next drill or punch two
holes in the centre of each end to take
the spindle. A bit of |in. piping is good
for this, and the handle can be either
bent or elbowed on with pipe-joints at
one end.
Allow a good swing, say, 16in., as
turning with too short a crank is apt to
be awkward.
Next rivet cross-stays on both ends
of drum to stiffen them, and key or
bolt a spindle to the stays to pre-
vent drum turning on the spindle. A
Hin. by fin. flat-iron with a full twist
in the middle to go round spindle will
do for this. Place spindle in position,
bend the flap inwards and wire in a
couple of places to keep in position.
Spindle should project 9in. at each end.
Mount on four posts sunk well into
the ground far enough apart and high
enough to allow your barrow to go com-
fortably underneath the drum. Bolt two
bits of 3in. by 2in. timber across the end
posts and cut grooves in them to accom-
modate the spindle-ends.
Put the mix in dry and turn several
times. Then pour in necessary water and
turn again until thoroughly mixed. A
little practice is necessary to acquire the
correct swing, as inexpert swinging will
allow some of the contents to spill into
the barrow unmixed.
To empty the mixed concrete into
the barrow simply reverse, and the lot
pours out.
The drum will comfortably hold three
kero.-buckets of mix with the necessary
cement and water.
We made ours 10 years ago, and it is
still going strong.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Gumblegubbin”: A simple vermin
wash for sheepskins: Boil lib. arsenate
of soda in 4gal. water, and apply when
cold. Another mixture is made with
4oz. arsenic and Boz. soda crystals to
lgal. water. The pelts should be painted
soon after the skinning.
“Bung”: Wear rubber gloves or grease
hands with vaseline or some other oil
pushed well under the nails when hand-
ling arsenic. The poison may eat its way
under the nails. It is a good idea to
wash the hands daily in limewater or a
weak solution of hypo.
“Brereton”: It is hard to beat a squee-
gee for cleaning cement bail- and dairy-
floors. Throw a bucket of water on the
floor and the squeegee will wipe it clean.
One can be made out of an old car-tyre.
Cut a piece out about 12in. by 4in., and
bolt it between two boards. Fix it on
it to an old broom-handle.
“Tryit”: To crank a light engine with-
out losing skin, wrap a length of lin.
belting one turn around either flywheel.
Have one end of belt below wheel and
one on top. Charge with benzine vapor,
rock on compression by pulling back-
wards and forwards on the belting, and
then give a quick pull on whichever end
of the belting revolves the engine the
right way. It makes easy starting, especi-
ally for two-stand shearing plants.
“O. W. Waireki”: A handy saw-horse
can be quickly made from a couple of
benzine-cases. Cut identical half-moon-
shaped holes in the centre of the top
sides of each box for the wood to rest
in. Place according to the length of the
logs to be sawn. If inclined to wobble,
half-fill each box with gravel or sand.
“Ymar”: From his seven-acre plot of
beans last' season J„ Costello, of Wy
Yung (Vic.), realised almost £lOOO. The
2647 bags, each weighing 501 b., which
he picked sold in the Melbourne market
at from 7s. to 10s. per bag.

FAIRY STORY.
It was well past the lunch hour. Sigh -
ing loudly, the new hand looked at
the blackened tea-billy and then signi-
ficantly at his employer, a hard-hearted
old cow-cocky.
“What about it, boss?” he ventured
timidly.
There was no reply.
Half an hour passed, and the new hand
again asked “What about it?”
Still there was no answer.
Very slowly 20 minutes passed, and
then, almost desperately, the lad cried:
“Hey! What about it?”
The boss, who was stretched full
length on the ground, yawned.
“What about what?” he demanded.
“What about us starting work again?”

“TALKING OF AEROPLANES”
“The birds in ‘Treasure Island’ are the
property of Mr. P. K. Wrigley, and Australians
may feel-a slightly proprietary interest in them
from the fact that a cousin of Mr. Wrigley
is now a resident of Sydney and married a
Sydney girl.”— “S. M. Herald.”
My new film, “Farthingale’s Fortune,”
is certain to be an outstanding success
on account of its international appeal.
Tibetans will feel a proprietary interest
in it, as the edelweiss used in the opening
scene is from the collection of Mr.
Timothy Tightwad, whose uncle once
said “Where is Tibet?” He married an
Assyrian.
A feature that will particularly appeal
to all Spaniards will be the rabbits shot
(at) by Captain Farthingale in the hunt-
ing scene. They were lent by a gentle-
man who wishes to remain anonymous,
but whose grandfather was at one time
a financial adviser to the leading mata-
dor of Seville. His sister married a
baker.
Americans will appreciate a scene to-
wards the end of the play where Far-
thingale discovers the missing family
jewels in a pawnshop in Castlereagh-
street. As this shop is less than a mile
from Circular Quay it is quite probable
that many an American sailor has
pawned his watch or jack-knife there.

Aldous P. Boover perused the adver-
tisement he had just drafted. It con-
cerned his own special course of prac-
tical psychology.
“Are you nervous?” it read. “Are you
chained by petty fears and inhibitions?
Then you’re the man I want! I will de-
velop your latent powers and awaken
the giant within you! I will teach you
self-mastery that will enable you to con-
trol all circumstances! I will fill your
mind with positive thoughts that will
make success an absolute certainty! Just
tear out, sign and post the coupon, and
unlimited confidence and prosperity will
be yours!”
Aldous P. Boover ran his fingers
through his hair nervously.
“If that doesn’t get me a few quid,”
he muttered, “there’s only one thing left
—suicide!,”

“A well-known antique dealer is about to
visit these shores.” — News item.

are definitely not for sale.
FALSE ALARM.
The nervous little man lived in a
semi-rural suburb, half an hour’s walk
from the station, along a badly-lighted
road bordered by bush on both sides,
and for once he stayed out very late.
Pausing to tie a shoe-lace, he heard
footsteps coming along behind him. As
the few other people residing in the street
were in the habit of going to bed early,
visions of gunmen and basher-gangs
coursed through his mind. He was a
fast walker, and alarm lent increased
pace to his strides, but the faster he
walked the more the pedestrian behind
him increased his speed.
He took all the short cuts he could
think of, but relentlessly his pursuer
pounded along after him.
At last, in desperation, the nervous
little man climbed through a hole in the
fence of an ancient and neglected ceme-
tery, where, with his back against a
tombstone, he tried ineffectually to re-
sign himself to his fate.
“What do you want?” he quavered
tremulously when the other man came
up to him. “Why are you following
me?”
“If I scuttled about the' country in
the erratic way you do, my friend, I’d
never touch a drop,” said the other
severely. “I’ve come out here to camp
at a friend’s place, and the night porter
at the station told me you lived next
door to him. Excuse my asking, old
chap, but is this your present as well as
your future address?”
L. R.
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES.
On him I’ll never scowl or frown
Whom Fate has felled with spiteful
whack.
I’ll always help the man who’s down,
The chap who’s flat upon his back.
The under-dog I’ll aid, I say,
Until with weariness l drop —
At any rate until the day
When I’m the chap who sits on top !

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XIV. — The Dictator.
To be a dictator and have at your call
The whole of the nation’s resources —
The Treasury, Excise and Customs and
all
The naval and military forces —
Is surely a thing to make anyone smile
With pleasure he cannot conceal;
But that is the one thing he simply
can’t do,
However bucked up he may feel.
For as soon as a tyrant commences to
grin
He loses his job and lets someone
else in.
Taking them up and down, dictators are
not usually large men, but reading from
left to right they are often fairly bulky.
They usually possess a dynamic per-
sonality, a special brand of shirt and a
special salute. The fact that the last
two are more noticeable than the first
leads many people to think that they
are the more important attributes. Ac-
cordingly, many would-be dictators have
secured a shirt, invented a salute and
have gone forth to dictate, with disas-
trous results to themselves.
A dictator also needs large boots. He
wants them large for three reasons: (1)
So that no one can say he’s getting too
big for his boots, (2) so that no one else
will be able to step into them, and (3)
so that there’ll be room for him to die
in them.
All dictators die in their boots.
One thing a dictator must not have is
a sense of humor. He has, to begin with,
only one supporter —himself. If he has
a sense of humor the idea of himself
dictating to a whole nation will seem so
ludicrous that he’ll
laugh himself out
of it.
But the true dic-
tator doesn’t laugh.
He remains serious
and gathers a few
followers. The rest
of the town laugh
and think what a
funny fellow he is.
He remains serious.
They realise he isn’t
joking. They join
up. Seriousness is
catching, and they
become as serious as
the rest. The pro-
cess goes on until
the whole nation is
gladly being dic-
ta te d to. They
don’t realise that the
joke is on them.
Not a smile any-
where, least of all
on the dictator. One
grin from him and
the spell is broken.
Once established,
the next thing is to
choose a name. Not
a title. Titles are
effete. Any name
will do, but prefer-
ably one that hasn’t
been used before.
Something like “The Deuce” or “The
Brown Terror” is probably the most
suitable.
If you ever become a dictator it is a
good plan to make hay while the sun
shines. Put as much as you can aside
for the wife and youngsters and don’t
let up on the shirt-and-salute racket.
After all, you’re not there for fun. Above
all, don’t smile. Talk as much as you
like, and contradict yourself every
second sentence, but don’t laugh.
On the whole, however, the profession
is not to be recommended. The openings
are so few, there is no guarantee of
tenure, and no superannuation fund.
Furthermore, there is no training school,
and the beginner never really knows
whether he is cut out for a dictator until
he gets there. And then it is too late
to change his mind.

The best way to begin boxing is to take part
in a tournament, but it is advisable to undergo
at least six months’ expert tuition before appear-
ing in public. If no able boxing teachers are
in your district, there are some in Sydney.
Did W. M. Hughes take personal action to
improve Diggers’ conditions during the war ?
If so, what was the result ? —4470.
In 1918 W. M. Hughes, becoming aware that
there were grievances—he was “counted out”
while addressing Diggers in France —invited all
who had a complaint to make to write to him,
guaranteeing that letters would get past the
censor. Over 14,000 letters were received, and
a number of real troubles was rectified.
Amongst these were: Wrongful paybook deduc-
tions, separation allowances made available for
wives and families in England, ration money
while away from units increased, many field
penalties lessened or wiped out, certain hospital
deductions removed and leave to Australia for
original Anzacs granted. A good number of
injustices in individual cases was adjusted.
Is there any detailed account of the life
of Buckley, the “Wild White Man of Aus-
tralia” ? —4478.
In England, in 1836, Governor Arthur pub-
lished Buckley’s account of his 32 years
amongst the blacks, as it was written up by
Surveyor Wedge, who first saw the wanderer
at Indented Camp, when he found Bateman’s
camp. In 1852 Buckley’s “Life, and Adven-
tures,” the work of John Morgan, was pub-
lished in Hobart.
(1) When were convicts last landed in Aus-
tralia ? (2) How was land first acquired, and
were free grants of land made to settlers ? (3)
Percentage of total population employed in the
various trades and industries ? (4) When was
the Labor party first formed in Australia?
(5) Did any other country enjoy universal fran-
chise before Australia ? (6) Books on these
subjects ? —3960.
(1) In N.S.W. and Moreton Bay, 1850;
in Tasmania, 1853; in W.A., transportation did
noc cease until 18 68. (2) Between 1788 and
1831 th ■ early Governors had the power to
make free grants of land to suitable persons,
whether free set ers or emancipists, grants
being usually made up to 2000 acres but
officers and officials helped themselves to big
blocks of many thousand acres. By 1831, prob-
ably 4,000,000 - acres . had been given away.
After this date grants by purchase were intro-
duced. (3) Latest census figures are not yet
available. (4) Although isolated attempts were
made to return Labor representatives in the
'eighties, it was not until 1891,• as- a result of
the maritime strike, that action was taken in
all colonies (except Tasmania) to form a politi-
cal Labor party. (5) Maoriland, 1893.
Universal franchise was introduced into Aus-
tralia as hereunder: N.S.W., 1902; S.A., 1894;
W.A., 1899; Commonwealth, 1902; Tasmania,
1903; Queensland, 1905; Victoria, 1908. (6)
“Australian Encyclopaedia,” from Angus and
Robertson.
(1) What books has Con Drew written ? (2)
Has he written any stage plays ? If so, where
and when produced ? (3) Has any of his work
appeared on the screen ? (4) Are his works
still available ? (5) Is he an Australian ? —4409.
(1) “The Grafter,” “Jinker,” “Doings ot
Dave,” “Rogues and Ruses,” “Fringe of the
Underworld,” “Gilbert Reminiscences,” “Hooks
and Crooks” and “A Sydney Harbor Beach-
comber” (in the press). (2) Yes, “Jinker”
was dramatised and was produced at the Sydney
Theatre Royal in 1917. (3) “Dope,” made by
an Australian film company and released about
10 years ago. (4) Some are out ol print;
most recent ones are obtainable all leading
Sydney bookstalls. (5) Yes, born in Brisbane.
In a recent broadcast a soprano saiig what
was described on the programme as , “Waltz.
Song from 'll Bacio’ ( Arditi).” Is there such
an opera? —44oB.
No. Arditi did write operas—“l Brigand”
and “La Spia” were best known —but the “11
Bacio” waltz, the only composition of his to
survive, was,not part of any of them, being
published separately. sets of words
have been written to it. ..
Can-salts of tartar be used for bleaching the
hair? Is it drying? If so,"can l prevent this
effect when using it ? —4260.
Salts of tartar (carbonate of potash) may
be used as a bleach for fair hair. Dissolve
two level teaspoons in a basin of warm water,
the solution to be used as a final rinse after
shampooing. Dry and brush the hair well in
sunlight, if possible.- To avoid any drying effect,
and also to impart sheen to the hair, apply
a few drops of almond oil as a dressing after
brushing as above. A preliminary shampoo
is essential if the hair is naturally greasy.
(1) To what extent is mutton-bird oil being
used in the treatment of tuberculosis ? (2)
Is it likely to be effective in a case of T.B.
of the kidneys ? (3) Where can supplies be
obtained ? —4215.
(1) The oil has been suggested as a remedy
(internal) in chest, bronchial and lung debilities.
It has virtues similar to cod-liver oil, the com-
bination of fatty elements with iodine, phos-
phates, etc., being of value in dealing with
malnutrition and wasting diseases. (2) No.
T.B. demands treatment under medical super-
vision. (3) Chemists can supply at 3s. per Boz.
Best method of extracting scrub ticks from
the skin ? ■ Also, what after-treatment is recom-
mended ? —4258.
When the tick is located dab lightly with
turpentine or kerosene. This causes the insect
to release its hold in the flesh; the body, with
head intact if possible, being then removed
with a pair of tweezers. Cutting with scissors
is not advised. Some swelling of the part
usually persists for a few days. Bathe fre-
quently with hot water, and paint daily with
tincture of iodine until relieved.
I am troubled with superfluous hairs on my
neck. I have used a mixture of peroxide and
ammonia for months, but it has no effect. Is
there anything I can do ? —4241.
Growth of the kind develops with frequent
shaving of the area after the normal hair-
trim. The fine hair or down that is always
present tends to coarsen. There is no treat-
ment apart from bleaching with hydrogen
peroxide and ammonia. The peroxide applica-
tion should restrict growth by progressive
splitting and destruction of the individual
hair shaft.
Origin of the word "sterling.”— 4473.
It is not quite definite. The Easterlinges
were German traders who established in Eng-
land a reputation for the purity of the silver
they used in exchange: it is conceivable that,
contracts may have been made in Easterlinge
or “sterling.” On the other hand, it is main-
tained that “stoorling,” a small star used on
some early Norman pennies, or the starling
(four of the birds were stamped on some
Edward the Confessor coins) is more likely to
have been the derivation.
I understand that Balzac was keenly inter-
ested in the occult, and wrote books on the
subject. What were these? —4481.
Psychology, mesmerism, physiognomical de-
tails, spiritualism and all manner of mysticism
are woven into the whole labric of his “La
Comedie Humaine,” but are dominant in
“Seraphita,” “Louis Lambert,” “The Quest
of the Absolute,” “The Wild Ass’s Skin” and
most of the short stories collected under the
title “Christ in Flanders.” All are available in
English translations.
(1) When did Sir A. Quiller-Couch ("Q.”)
write ? (2) What are some of his books ? (3) Is
he regarded as a literary genius ? (4) Where
could I obtain a description of some of his
best-known books ? —3626.
(1) Novels (“Troy Town,” etc.) from 1887
to about 1909. (2) “Troy Town,” “From a
Cornish Window,” “Dead Man’s Rock,” “The
Blue Pavilion,” “The Delectable Duchy,” etc.,
and many: volumes of criticism, verse, etc. (3)
No. He is Professor of English Literature at
Cambridge University, and is an accepted
authority on his subject. He was born in 1863,
and began at 24 as a novelist of Cornwall. (4)
Any literary work of . criticism will include him.
A work on the art of literary criticism will
describe his books and give a full examina-
tion of his influence and importance.
It is said that Wordsworth’s ode “On Intima-
tions of Immortality, from Recollections of
Early Childhood” had its germ in a “less-
known poem.” What is the poem referred to ?
—4486.
Critics who cover seventeenth-century litera-
ture trace suggestions for Wordsworth’s master-
piece in “The Retreate” of Henry Vaughan
(1622-95). —
Happy those early days, when I
Shin’d in my angell-infaney!
....When yet I had not walkt above
A mile or two from my first love,
And looking back, at that short space,
Could see a glimpse of His bright face;
When in some gilded cloud, or flowre,
My gazing soul would dwell an houre,
And in those weaker glories spy
Some shadows of eternity.
Also there are traces of influence on the “Inti-
mations” in another poem by Vaughan, “Be-
yond the Veil.”
How can one enter the Diplomatic Service
in Australia ? —4394.
The present policy of the Commonwealtth
of Australia is not to appoint diplomatic repre-
sentatives in other countries, and conse-
quently there is no diplomatic service for Aus-
tralia. Selected graduates of Australian Uni-
versities can, however, enter the Colonial
Service, and a scheme is in operation for ad-
mission to this service. Application for par-
ticulars should be made to Prof. K. H. Bailey,
Melbourne Uni., secretary to the Colonial
Appointments Committee. The appointments
at the disposal of the Secretary of State for
the Colonies cover agricultural, veterinary,
forestry, survey, medical, geological, financial,
educational and various other technical
vocations.
(1) How many "heads” in the civil service
of Queensland are drawing salaries from £BOO
per annum and upwards, including the salaries
of judges and Land Board officials ? (2) Who
represents the Land Administration, Board of
Queensland, what salaries, also their names ?
Do they get any expenses ? If so, what for ? (3)
Can 10 p.c. late penalty be charged on overdue
rents, the Commonwealth Government having
reduced interest on money borrowed from the
banks from 8 p.c. to p.c. ? If so, why the
contrast ? —4414.
(1) 38. (2) W. L. Payne (Chairman), £1400;
A. G. Melville, £1134; and V. Grenning
(Director of Forests), £697. The members
of the board are allowed travelling expenses
when absent from Brisbane on official duties.
(3) The law prescribes a 10 p.c. penalty for
late payment of Crown dues. This is charge-
able for the period only for which the rent is
in arrears. It is not a flat-rate penalty. In
practice the 10 p-.c. penalty is only enforced
in cases of deliberate default, the penalty being
generally written down to 5 p.c. or wholly
remitted in genuine cases of hardship.
I wish to make casein glue on a commercial
scale. (1) What is the method of manufac-
ture ? (2) How is the dirty curd cleansed ?
(3) Market price in Australia ? (4) Is there
an A ustralian demand ? (5) Names of books
on the subject ? —4286.
(1) The milk is heated, charged with acids,
washed, dried and pulverised, eight gallons of
milk being required to produce lib. dry casein.
The glue is made from 1 part casein in fine
powder rubbed up with 3 parts silicate soda.
There are other formulse for adhesives em-
ploying casein. (2) and (5) See Henley’s “Book
of Recipes,” from N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney, 30s. posted. (3) and (4)
Write to the N.S.W. Chamber of Manufac-
tures, 26 O’Connell-street, Sydney.
Particulars of Comtesse du Barry, portrayed
in a current talkie ? —4417.
Marie Jeanne Becu du Barry was born at
Vaucouleurs on Aug. 19, 1746, the illegitimate
daughter of a tax-collector. She lived as a
courtesan in Paris under the name of Mile.
Lange. Jean, Compte du Barry, took her into
his house to make it more attractive to the
dupes whose money he won by gambling. She
became official mistress of Louis XV in 1769
after a nominal marriage with Guillaume du
Barry. She was accused before the Revolu-
tionary Tribunal of having conspired against
the republic, condemned to death on Dec. 7,
1793, and guillotined the same evening.
(1) Value of N.S.W. postage stamp depict-
ing Capt. Cook ? (2) Are N.S.W. stamps in-
scribed “One Hundred Years” of any value ?
(3) What do these stamps represent ? (4) Value
of the penny red “Van Diemen’s Land” ? (5)
Any market for these stamps, if so, where ?
4121.
(1) No value. (2) Yes, the ss. and the £l.
The ss. is catalogued at from Bs. 6d. to 225. 6d.
used, and the £1 from 20s. to 555. used.
Except for certain rare perforation varieties,
the remaining stamps are of practically no
value. (3) These stamps commemorate the cen-
tenary of the founding of the colony of New
South Wales. (4) Catalogued at from Bs. 6d.
to £35, according to watermark and perfora-
tion, etc. (5) Very doubtful unless you possess
some of the ss. and £1 stamps. Try A. C.
Campe and Co., 21 Sydney Arcade, Sydney.
Voltage, current and type of generator re-
quired for electric welding ? —4353.
Electric-welding processes may be placed in
two groups: “arc welding,” using the heat
of an electric arc, and “resistance welding,”
where heat is produced by the resistance of the
metal being welded to the passage of the cur-
rent. Arc welding can be done by any electric
arc having the required degree of stability and
sufficient heat to accomplish fusion. A gene-
rator supplying an E.M.F. of from 60 to 90
volts and a current of from 250 to 600 amperes,
depending upon the thickness of the metal to
be welded, will be suitable. A resistance weld-
ing machine consists of a single-phase trans-
former having a secondary of one or two turns
and a terminal E.M.F. of 5 to 10 volts, the
current being limited only by the sizes of the
pieces to be handled.

STRONG and
SMOOTH-SWINGING
SOME of the first “Cyclone” Gates ever
made (35 years ago) are still in daily
use. As good as those early styles were,
to-day’s “Cyclone” Gates are even better.
Embodying many recently evolved improve-
ments, they are stronger, more durable
smoother-swinging than ever.
The Hinges are bolted right through the
post and can never twist, sag or loosen. The
Chain and Knob Fastener holds under all
conditions. The frame and cross-members
are electrically welded. These, and many
other features, make a “Cyclone” Gate
practically everlasting.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
British Labor has drawn up a set of
regulations designed to prevent graft and
nepotism. Australian Labor should take
note. It would be difficult to estimate
how many votes it has lost in one parti-
cular State through decent sympathisers
declining to support men whose actions
have been under serious and not dis-
proved suspicion.

Cabled that Madison (Wisconsin) has
arranged a welcome to Pat O’Dea, “the
greatest footballer America has known.”
O’Dea is a Melbournite who rowed for
Yarra R.C. and played Australian foot-
ball for Melbourne. He left for U.S.
30 years ago, took on the Yankee game
and is the only Australian so far honored
by Mr. Dooley in his books. The O’Deas
came from Ballarat and had pots of
money up to the ’93 crash.

“Cantab”: From the cables:
Maudsleigh Dudley, 58, an Australian,
has' been sentenced to two years’ imprison-
ment for obtaining £4600 by a confidence
trick.
His Christian name was “Maurice” when
I first struck him, and he was then pos-
turing as a globe-trotting Yorkshire
squire. His only association with Aus-
tralia consists of a visit which he paid
to a leading Sydney hotel with his wife
and small daughter before the war. A
small, dapper, genial customer, he made
a good thing out of two or three confid-
ing Australian officers during the war,
and from then on appears to have
adopted this country as his own. It is
bad luck for the Commonwealth that a
large percentage of British crooks call
themselves Australians and are not con-
tradicted by Scotland Yard. Dudley was
born in Belfast.

“Bondi Pursuivant”: No need to ask
Sir Nevile Wilkinson to explain the
mystery in connection with the Stapley
baronetcy (B. 14/11/’34). It became
extinct in 1701, and, of course, remains
so. There is no means of snatching titles
out of extinction, nor is there any such
phenomenon known to heraldic experts
as the “lapsing” of a title. No man
can put off a title which he has inherited.
He may call himself “Mr.” or “Rev.”
or anything else, but the title remains
in existence. The fact that the Stapley
baronetcy has been “assumed” since
1887 gives it as much standing as if I
were to assume the title of Emperor of
Ethiopia.

The Shandon has a long and varied
career behind her iron hull. She was
built in 1883 at Glasgow; in 1912 she
sailed under the Norwegian flag; she
changed owners several times, and later
became a coal hulk. During the war
she was reconditioned and, under sail,
carried general cargo. Once more she
became a coal barge; but in Melbourne
she has been rejuvenated for the Cen-
tenary Maritime Exhibition sponsored by
the Ship Lovers’ Society. In place of
wheat, tea and timber, she now carries
numbers of model ships, old nautical in-
struments, a sea-chest that smells of brine
and camphor, whales’ teeth, pickled sea
dragons, sharks’ eggs, ships’ log scrap-
books and a journal of Abel Tasman.
Bits from Captain Cook’s journal are so
worded:
March, 1769 —Off Cape Horn Many
birds as ufual were conftantly about the
ship, Mr. Banks killed no lets than 62 in
one day Upon the whole, Rio de
Janeiro is a very good place for fhips to
put in at that want refrefhment, beef

“Jeames”: Cabled that the British
Government is “compounding the pen-
sion of £5OOO p.a. which was granted to
the heirs of Lord Nelson after Trafal-
gar.” Nelson had no children, and the
title and pension went to a brother. The
brother was an Anglican parson, and so
was his son, the third Earl, but the
present Earl is a Catholic, and so can’t
present to the solitary family living. The
Treasury has already paid the family
£650,000 in pensions: the idea is to hand
over £lOO,OOO now and call it square.

TWO-WAY, DOUBLE ACTION
TYRE INFLATION
The “RENRUT” QUADRUPLE TYRE PUMP gives a
remarkable service in tyre inflation. Built on the principle
of quadruple compression, which provides a double-acting
main barrel, drawing in air on both the up and down strokes,
this unique mechanism doubles the capacity of the large barrel,
and so halves the time of inflation. The inner high-pressure
cylinder ensures easy delivery of this large volume.
Sturdily built for a long life of faithful service, the “RENRUT”
QUADRUPLE offers quicker and easier pumping than you
have ever known.

PIONEER OF CLOSED CAR STREAMLINING
PUT THROUGH ITS PACES.
WILLYS 77 GETS AN A-CLASS PASS.
BY FRED BERRY.
AERODYNAMIC principles in body profiles were first fully
i exploited on the Australian market by the Willys 77, which
has now been thoroughly tested over “The Bulletin” course.
In these days, drastic, and sometimes radical, changes
are expected almost as a matter of course in each new-season
model, but the Willys 77 is substantially identical with the car
offered to the public nearly 18 months ago. But, having been
a pioneer, it is still entirely modern in design, and, what is
more to the point, as performance figures clearly prove, it
continues to hold its own with almost anything on the highway.
Any hesitancy in accepting this car’s
unusual design must be more than over-
come when evidence is adduced of its
extreme economy, fine road perform-
ance, ease of handling and passenger
comfort and long life and reliability.
Highly efficient streamlined body of the Willys 77 sedan.
Relatively cheap to buy, yet built of
high-grade materials throughout, the
Willys 77 is a commonsense car that
avoids extravagance of any sort. Its
streamlined profile, while unconven-
tional, is a studied and scientific attempt
to minimise the air pressure that builds
itself up as speed increases, with the
Section of Willys carburettor: A, inlet
needle and seat; B, float; C, bowl vent;
D, accelerating pump; E, idle adjust-
ment; F, choke shutter; G, main nozzle
air bleed; H, main nozzle outlet; I, idle
and low-speed discharge holes; J, throttle
shutter; K, idle channel restriction
holes; L, main nozzle; M and N, meter-
ing-pin assembly; O, main fuel jet; P,
main supply channel; Q, float level; R,
check valve; S, check-valve relief.
result that high average touring speed
can be maintained without excessive
petrol consumption.
Mechanically the engine is in keeping
with modern design. The four cylinders
have a bore of 3|in. and stroke of 4|in.
giving a piston displacement of 134.2
cubic inches. R.A.C. horse-power rating
is 15.63, but a compression ratio of 5.13
to 1 and specially-designed anti-knock
combustion chambers enable the motor
to deliver a 48 b.h.p. at 3200 r.p.m.
Side-by-side valves are used, exhausts
being provided in the cylinder blocks
with case-hardened inserts, thus assuring
good compressions for long periods, to-
gether with freedom from necessity for
valve-grinding. Pistons are of aluminium
alloy, carefully balanced, with floating
gudgeon pins. Four narrow-section
rings are fitted to each piston. Cylinders
are cast en bloc, integral with the upper
half of the crankcase, and, in order to
ensure the rigidity of the crankshaft and
so eliminate engine vibration, heavy webs
extend laterally from the main bearings.
Intake and exhaust manifolds are in
the form of a neat composite casting,
being designed so that the exhaust gases
heat the inlet manifold during cold
weather,. thereby reducing the length
of time the choke must be used and
making the engine more flexible during
the warming-up period.
The down-draught carburettor is of
the fixed-jet type, specially designed and
calibrated for the 77 engine. It auto-
matically provides correct mixture at all
engine speeds and loads except idling,
and provision is made for this. A large
vertical air-cleaner and silencer is
attached to the intake of the carburettor,
and a heavy pressed-steel stay from
cylinder block to air-cleaner keeps the
intake system rigid when the motor
rocks in its flexible mounting.
The Bgal. petrol tank is slung between
rear dumb-irons, and is well protected
from impact' by the metal fairing of the
streamlined body. Fuel is delivered to
the carburettor by means of a diaphram-
type pump driven by an eccentric and
lever from the camshaft. A glass settling
bowl and large-section gauze strainers
readily detachable for cleaning keep im-
purities in the fuel from entering the
induction system.
Particular attention has been given to
the cooling system, air being drawn
through a cellular
radiator core, located
behind the dummy
streamlined grille, by
means of a large four-
bladed fan, driven in
tandem with the cen-
trifugal water pump
by a “V” belt from
the crankshaft pulley.
Water passages in the
cylinder casting are of
generous dimensions,
ensuring efficient cool-
ing of the “hot spots”
adjacent to the
exhaust valve s —a
most important fea-
ture in engine design.
Coil-and-battery ig-
nition system is
employed, with automatic spark advance
located in the distributor head.
Lubrication is of the full pressure
type, feeding crankshaft, connecting rod,
camshaft bearings and timing chain with
a direct spray through the oilways to
other engine parts. The Willys patented
“Float O” floating oil intake in the
crankcase allows pure surface oil only
to pass though the pressure
system.
The engine is suspended in
the chassis by a “floating
power” mounting using com-
pressed rubber anchorages,
while, in order to prevent “whip-
ping” of controls, the clutch
pedal, brake pedal and hand-brake lever
are mounted independently of the power
plant.
Transmission is
through a single-
plate dry - disc
clutch, with auto-
matic compensa-
tion for wear of
clutch fabric, to
a three-speed-and-
reverse gearbox
with central ball-
type change-
speed lever. The
open propeller
shaft is fitted
with enclosed
metal universal
joints fore and
aft, and the rear
axle assembly, in
a banjo-type
housing, is of the
same floating
type, the final
ratio being 4.3 to
1. The differen-
tial gear runs on
Timken taper-
roller bearings,
while live axles
are removable,
with Timken
taper bearings at
the wheel-ends.
Steering is semi-
irreversible worm-
and-gear type,
ratio 12 to 1.
The turning circle is 34ft. The brakes
are of the four-wheel Bendix duo-servo,
internal-expanding, two-shoe, self-energis-
ing type, with a total braking area of
134 sq. in. Road clearance is Bin.
The chassis is extremely rigid, of the
double-drop X-member type, with ad-
ditional loop bracing to prevent flexing
at engine mountings.
Bodywork, upholstery and internal
fittings are of good quality and in keep-
ing with modern practice, while the
simple yet effective instrument-board
located directly in front of the steering-
wheel allows the driver to consult the
various readings without taking his eyes
from the road.

course was a stock demonstrator, driven

gether with driver and observer, the
four-door sedan weighed 24|cwt., and
en route to Parramatta, through city
traffic, the Willys 77 threaded its way
m a most purposeful manner, top-gear
“pick-up” being astonishing for a motor
of moderate power.
On the open road through Baulkham
Hills a steady speed of 40 to 45 m.p.h.
was maintained with ease. Approach-
ing Windsor the rolling test was con-
ducted. Here, from a steady speed of
15 m.p.h., with gear-lever in neutral, the

car rolled 725yds. before coming to rest
—an excellent performance and proof of
truth and freedom in all transmission
details.
Next test, that of determining maxi-
mum speed over a measured mile with
flying start, revealed the value of the
Willys streamlined body, for with little
more than half a mile in which to reach
peak revs, the distance was clocked in
49 2-ssec., averaging 72.8 m.p.h. Over
this section the motor appeared smooth
and free from vibration.
Through Richmond and approaching
Kurrajong, the Grose Valley by-pass
road was taken in order to test the Willys
under “back-country” conditions. Over
this section the car behaved splendidly,
the generous wheel-lock and excellent
road-holding qualities permitting the
difficult going to be negotiated with ease
and comfort.
On the speed climb of Kurrajong
Mountain, from a standing start, the
2 1-5-mile climb was clocked in 3min.
33sec. Second and top gears were used
throughout, and the remarkably fast
climb was due to excellent road-holding
qualities, together with astonishing
second-gear speed on hills, the speed-
ometer dropping below 40 only on diffi-
cult hairpin bends.
Returning down the mountain a test
of the emergency-braking equipment was
made, with satisfactory results, and tak-
ing the cross-country road via Castle-
reagh to Penrith, further performance
tests were conducted. That of covering
l-sth mile in top gear at minimum pace
was clocked in lmin. 45sec., averaging
6.8 m.p.h., while the accelerated section
of a similar dis-
tance occupied but
17sec., the car
crossing the finish-
ing line at almost
60 m.p.h. and aver-
aging 42.3 m.p.h.
From a standing
start to 50 m.p.h.,
through all gears,
was timed at 13
2-ssec., an aston-
ishing performance
for a 15-h.p. sedan.
Acceleration tests
from 10 to 30
m.p.h. in top and second gears produced
similar high performances—9sec. from
10 to 30 in top and 5 4-ssec. from 10
to 30 in second.
Returning along the Western-road via
Penrith, a test of the Bendix braking
equipment was made, the car stopping
from a speed of 25 m.p.h. in 25ft. 9in.
Time taken for the journey of 118 miles,
inclusive of all tests, was found to be
3hr. 20min., averaging 35.4 m.p.h., and
fuel consumed was 3gal. 3pts., an aver-
age petrol consumption of 35 m.p.g.
(42.7 ton-miles) —an extremely gratifying
all-round performance.
Motor Oddities.
A single-cylinder Darraq, owned by
W. J. Winterbottom of the well-known
motor-importing firm, was the first car
licensed by the Perth City Council in
1906. Naturally it bore the number .one.
“Crash”: Makeshift repairs? A hun-
dred miles from the city my motor-bike
konked-out as I was making a steep
grade. Investigation revealed a hole the
size of a pea in the top of the piston.
I pushed the bike back to a small town-
ship with the intention of railing it back
to Wellington (M.L.), as there was no
hope of procuring a new piston locally.
As I was passing a little general store I
noticed a card of pot-mends in the win-
dow. I bought one of these gadgets,
screwed it up tight on the piston face,
retarded the spark and went on my way
rejoicing.

“Spark Gap”: Stranded in a little Vic.
Mallee town recently with a burnt-out
magneto armature, and not a chance of
getting a replacement or a rewind for
several days, we had to rack our brains
for a means of effecting a temporary
repair. The use of an old Ford coil was
suggested, and after a little trouble it
was fitted on the inside of the dash-
board under the bonnet. Next the
magnets were removed from the mag-
neto and the cover-plate dismantled.
Then a lead was run from the positive
terminal on the battery (see diagram)
through the coil to the make-and-break
of the magneto and a condenser. The
negative terminal of the battery was
earthed to the chassis frame. The high-
tension lead from the coil was next con-
nected to a strip of bent metal and insu-
lated from the “mag.,” but making
contact with the rotating distributor
brush, and the result tyas a really first-
class battery-ignition system which has
been in constant operation, and provides
much easier starting than the magneto.

Lap after lap he espied that caterpillar
making steady, if slow, progress. Other
drivers got to hear of it, and bets were
laid as to how long that caterpillar would
last on a roadway on which 40 racing
cars were performing. The caterpillar
survived. When it was within a yard of
the side of the road opposite from
whence it started a humane official picked
it up on a leaf and put it safely in a

A 50 -Year-Old Company that Has Developed into the Largest
Organisation of Its Kind in the Southern Hemisphere
Fifty years ago, before the crack of whip
and the beat of hoofs gave way to the toot
of horns and the purr of powerful cars,
Holden’s Wholesale Leather and Saddlery
business was started at Adelaide. In 1917,
when the firm was then engaged in making
horse-drawn coaches, the first motor car
body was built.
In that first year of production, 100
bodies were built. In recent years pro-
duction has swelled to over 45,000 bodies
annually for local use, whilst overseas
markets are also being catered for.
The main Holden plant at Woodville,
South Australia, covers 40 acres, including
1,000,000 square feet of covered space.
Plant and machinery to a value of over
£700,000 are installed in these buildings,
in which are carried huge stocks of . Aus-
tralian timber, leather, steel, etc., and other
raw material. In all,more than £1,500,000
is invested in this plant, which employs
3,400 Australians.

wound twice around the exhaust-pipe
between tank and carburettor, so as to
deliver the kero. hot. For starting there
is a small auxiliary petrol-tank made
from a coffee-tin. But this pales to in-
significance alongside the treatment
which I saw an old shearer give to his
1918 Ford. He drove up to the shed
in it, let it stand idle all through the
shearing, and before he drove away
again he lit' a fire of brush under the
transmission. He explained that he used
mutton-fat as a lubricant and had to
melt it before he could get a start. Cross-
examined, he admitted that he had twice
set fire to the car, but apparently re-
garded that as only a trivial drawback.
The Trouble Lamp.
S.C.L. (Miranda, N.S.W.): My 1926 Jewett
has the cylinder for oil brakes bolted to the
dash under the bonnet, and l have great trouble
in pumping oil into the brake circulation with
the cylinder pump. Is there any other pump
or cylinder I could fit, or would you advise
repairing, and who would do it ?
Your hydraulic brakes are of the old Lock-
heed type. Pumping the tank will not com-
pensate the brakes but will only take up free
play in the pedal when through any reason
there is lack of oil in the system. Try taking
up the brake band to drum adjustment on each
wheel, and if this fails Better Brakes, Ltd., will
advise you what to do.
A.R.W. (New Farm, Q.). —(1) The small cen-
trifugal type of air-cleaner fitted to my car is
not sufficient on dusty roads, and 1 submit
design for home-made alternative using thick
felt as a filtering medium. Would this work ?
(2) When the small shaft carrying the bevel
pinions in the differential is vertical the top
pinion will drop down about 1-16 in., and when
the engine is started it at once jumps up against
the cap. How can this trouble be rectified ?
(1) It would be better than the original, but
would soon become clogged and restrict entry
of air to the carburettor. Try filling the con-
tainer with steel wool dipped in engine oil.
(2) Only cure is to machine off the rounded
backs of the gears and fit steel packing washers.
These should be at least |in. thick. The turn-
ing job is one for an expert fitter.

Hobart (Hobart). —What makes of cars have
gear positions as shown in accompanying
sketch ?

Motor (Gooloogong, N.S.W.). —(1) New
pistons have been fitted to my Model A Ford
after 16,500 miles, but oil is getting past on
top of the cylinders. Can this be overcome,
and how ? (2) To what pressure should my
30 X 4.50 tyres be inflated ? (3) The service
station 1 frequent uses thick gear oil for lubri-
cating the nipples on the shackles instead of
grease. Is this right ?
(1) Unless oil consumption is excessive and
plugs become foul, this condition is nothing to
worry about at 16,500 miles. If cylinders are
worn oval new rings cannot be expected to
hold either oil or compression. Worn inlet
valve guides will also allow oil to reach top
of piston. Check wear, and if cylinders are
out of round they must be either honed, re-
bored or relined. (2) Tyre pressure will depend
upon load. For a sedan with five passengers
321 b. is correct. (3) Yes.
J.F. (Wamboyne, N.S.W.).— At 40 m.p.h.
my Victory Dodge sways about the road from
side to side. I have had new parts in the
steering box and there is no play in any of
rhe parts. Front tyre wears on outside more
than inside. Cause and cure ?
Front wheels are out of alignment and camber
is excessive. Have camber and toe-in carefully
checked.
J.A.McC. (North Perth). —(1) On starting
my 1934 Standard from cold oil pressure shows
at 40 1 b., but on a run steadily falls to nil.
Oil, however, still comes up the feeder-tube
to the gauge. What should be done ? (2)
Oil consumption has lately increased heavily,
and stopping after a run vapor issues from the
crankcase breather and a film of fresh oil
has formed on the outside of engine. Cause
and cure ?
Both troubles arise from one source. Crank-
shaft bearings are worn slack allowing oil
to pass through freely without generating pres-
sure. Indications also point to worn cylinders
and the immediate need for a general overhaul
of engine.
C.A. (Hurlstone Park, N.S.W.).—(I) What
is wrong with my headlights ? When the car
is stationary with engine running the lights
seem bright, but when going along they get
dim. I use 6-8 -volt bulbs, 21 c.p. Would larger
c.p. overcome the difficulty ? (2) 1 have great
difficulty in selecting first gear. All is well
when starting out on a run, difficulty occurring
when engine is warm. What is the trouble ?
(1) Evidently the battery is in a poorly-
charged state, and the generator cuts out at
high engine revs. Check over the electrical
system. Larger bulbs will only make matters
worse. (2) Cannot suggest a remedy without
knowing make and type of car.
R.H.L. (Caringbah, N.S.W.).— The nut on
the back axle of my car is always coming
loose. The key is very short and no matter
how the nut is tightened it soon comes adrift
again. Cure ?
Have the keyway recut and fit a larger key,
and in addition secure the nut with a heavy
split pin.
A.H.J (Manly, N.S.W.).—/ recently broke a
connecting rod, scoring the side of one cylinder
wall, and now oil works past and fouls the
plug. Is there any remedy save reboring
cy n nder ?
The score can be filled by welding with
spec i a i so f t meta l, but the job will not be
guaranteed. Better to have the scored cylinder
relined, not a very expensive repair.

RADIO-INDUCTIVE INTERFERENCE.
Some Causes and Cures.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
Each year more and more electrical
appliances come into use in the house-
hold, and every store or shop where
perishable foods are handled has its elec-
trically-powered refrigerator. Because of
this increase in the use of electrical appli-
ances interference with radio reception
has gradually become more serious.
It has in many cases reached a stage
where the situation can no longer be
tolerated and the victim feels that some-
thing must be done about it. There arc,
however, varying degrees of the trouble,
and the few hints here should serve to
put many an unsuspecting sufferer on
the trail.
There are many kinds of appliances
and electrical machinery which can be

cited as almost certain offenders, but
sometimes the spluttering and crackling
sound in the radio receiver can be
traced to unsuspected sources. Electric

signs, electric motors (particularly in
lifts), fans, vacuum-cleaners, refrig-
erators, motor-car ignition systems, tram-
cars, trolley-’buses and several other
electrically-powered devices cause inter-
ference for the simple reason that a
spark or sparks occur somewhere. This
can be demonstrated easily by switching
on and off a house light with the receiver
in action. The spark is heard in the
form of a crackle. An electric-motor
commutator may be in such condition
that a series of sparks takes place under
the brushes, and the resulting sound is
a continuous and devastating splutter-

for use with domestic or other appliances.
ing, often amounting to a roar. Such
sparks from electrical apparatus set up
waves similar to those from a marine
spark transmitter, with the exception that
they are untuned and are thus heard
everywhere on the dial. The power-
wiring along the streets and in the house
plays a part in accentuating the pick-up
by the receiver, and may carry such in-
terference a considerable distance from
the point of origin. The logical thing
to do wherever possible is to locate the
source of the interference, and to deal
with it at this point. Reduction of the
sparking and the elimination of radiation
of its energy by means of the wires
carrying the current will result in relief
from the interference.
Interference May Be In Your Own Home.
Often when the blame is laid on the
power company or the neighbor’s
vacuum-cleaner the cause of the trouble
may be much closer at hand, and it is
as well to look over the
house on the following
lines:
Faulty tumbler-switch
contacts, lamps which
have not been pushed
home securely in their
sockets, or in which the
socket-pin springs have
weakened (see Fig. 1).
The screw terminals at
switches, ceiling roses,
fuse-boxes, etc., may be
corroded or loose and
thus making poor con-
tact. If a wire con-
nected to such acces-
sories is loose at the ter-
minal, the mere act of
walking across a room may cause
sufficient vibration to produce an arc.
Fig. 2 shows how the trouble may
be caused by the contact springs of a
wall switch. After some years of use
the springs are likely to slacken off, and
by pinching them closer together with a
pair of pliers the trouble may be
eliminated. Needless to relate, this opera-
tion should be done only with the main
switch at the house fuse-board off! Be-
sides being fairly easy to trace, such
faults are thus easily overcome. Loca-
tion is not usually difficult. If it is sus-
pected that the cause of interference is
within the house, switching on and off
various lights and appliances will narrow
down the search.
Using Chokes and Condensers.
Where sparking occurs at such
domestic appliances as fans, vacuum-
cleaners, refrigerators, sewing-machines,
gramophone-motors, etc., the commu-

arrangement; often effective.
tator and brushes of the motor should
first be examined. Many of these low-
power units use “universal” type motors,
and whether on D.C. or A.C. they can
be responsible for a lot of noise. Often
the cleaning of the parts with a rag
dipped in petrol is enough to remove the
sparking, but if the commutator is worn
it becomes necessary to fit some kind
of suppressor. Even with a brand-new
motor such a device is worth while, and
in the near future will probably be fitted
by the makers of all electrical power
units. In other parts of the world such
devices are compulsory by law, and the
sooner that is the rule in Australia the
better. - Fig. 3 shows the essentials.
There are two chokes in series with each
lead to the motor or whatever unit is
under consideration, and two condensers
are connected in series across the leads.
The centre connection between the con-
densers is connected to the frame of
the motor. It may be more effective to
connect this point to earth as well.
The coils prevent radiation along the
mains and the condensers reduce the in-
tensity of the sparks at the brushes. The
coils must be capable of carrying the
load taken by the motor, and thus neces-
sarily are of large physical dimensions.
About 150 turns of 20 D.C.C. copper
wire on a 3in.-diameter form is a safe
average, but smaller coils with finer-
gauge wire will suffice for low-consump-
tion units. Condenser values of .5 mfd.
at 400 volts working will be suitable.
Fig. 4 shows a more simple arrangement
which may be quite effective. A con-
Fig. 5. —A counterpoise may be an
advantage in some cases.
denser and resistance are connected in
series across the leads.
Interference from Outside Sources.
Where the interference is known to be
carried along the mains from some ex-
ternal source, if the origin is known, it
is necessary to seek the co-operation of
the owner of the offending apparatus,
the power-supply people, and possibly
the radio inspector’s department. Most
people will take a reasonable view of
the question, as they probably use radio
themselves. Often a pair of condensers
is all that is necessary to cut out the
crackle, and there should be no objection
to at least trying this simple remedy. If
the source of interference is unknown,
or there is some reasonable objection to
the fitting of a suppression device, then
the only remaining course is to barricade
the receiver from interference via the
power lines. This is not always fully
effective ; but in many cases it is. Such
interference often reaches the receiver
through the earth, particularly where the
Fig. 6.—Line filter for use at the receiv-
ing position. Similar in effect to that of
Fig. 3.
water-pipe is used to serve this purpose.
A counterpoise will often be effective,
and if an outside aerial is used the erec-
tion of such a counterpoise presents little
difficulty. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.
The screening of aerials and the use of
doublets has been dealt with in previous
articles, and these methods are often a
means to the end. If the interference is
carried along the mains and is in evi-
dence in a receiver using an inside aerial,
and still persists when the aerial is re-
moved entirely from the receiver aerial
terminal, the only likely cure is the line
filter. This is as shown in Fig. 6 and is
similar in effect to the arrangement of
Fig. 3.
Such choke and condenser arrange-
ments in a neat metal box can be ob-
tained from various manufacturers, and
they are quite easily connected between
the power point and the receiver. The
best place for them, however, is at the
point where the mains reach the house —
the fuse-board —but the fitting in this
case is not a job for the layman. If every
house had such a suppressor included
as part of the wiring, much would be
done to give the public quieter radio re-
ception. No doubt such units will in
time be standard equipment.
D. B. K.
SHOULD OPERA BE BROADCAST?
There are people, of course, who
would say, with hearty emphasis, that not
only should opera, grand, comique or
any sort, not be broadcast, but it should
be banned by the police, and all extant
scores burnt by the public hangman.
Holding that view, it is to be gathered, is
Mr. Montague Grover, who in another
place in this journal condemned all opera
as bad art because it “purports to rep-
resent action, which may be swift and
violent, by a medium which is neces-
sarily slow” and to “present by a suc-
cession or combination of sounds senti-
ments which are not presentable in any
medium.” I should like, if safely en-
sconced in a bombproof shelter, to listen
to a debate on this subject between Mr.
Grover and his sometime fellow-jour-
nalist Mr. Richard Wagner, but as Mr.
Wagner is no more I’ll have to wait till
I get to heaven. Most opera-goers will
say Mr. Grover is a tiny mite too sweep-
ing. There are surely some emotions,
and even some actions, for which a more
or less appropriate musical expression
can be found, and any imagination in
good working order can adapt itself to
such operatic conventions as a C in alt.,
delivered with the fervor of a factory
steam-whistle, emanating from a lady
supposed to be dying of a wasting disease
of the lungs.
But whether we stand with the Wag-
nerians or the Groverians we can agree
that there is a dickens of a lot of bad
art about the average presentation of
opera on the stage. Heroines, as a rule,
are judged by the way the librettist pre-
sents them—sweet, frail little creatures
of supernal beauty. Unfortunately, that
sort of physique seldom (some will
say never ) goes with the sort of voice
that can ride the orchestral storm. A
Melbourne critic used to say that once
round a prima donna was half-way
round Flemington, and when a Lola of
commanding height and the correct
voice-producing proportions is belabored
by an Alfio she could put in her pocket,
or a soprano four feet high and as broad
as she is long plays Juliet to a Romeo
like two yards of pump-water, the strain
on all save the finest imaginations reaches
breaking-point.
An eminent American writer has
suggested that it would be a far, far
safer world for art if the characters
were represented by cubical gramo-
phone-cabinets of about human height
and. of distinguishing colors moved in
position by marionette wire. Incident-
ally, it would save a lot of expense.
Still, it is to be supposed there would
be some little loss of spontaneity and
elan in such a presentation, and the idea
has not made headway. However, it
paves the way to a very strong argument
in favor of the broadcast opera—the
music, nothing but the music, and no
such distractions as scenery and people

and dresses that don’t fit the spirit of
the scene. But, again, if there isn’t any
scene, is it opera? Opera should enchant
both eye and ear.
An experiment that might be under-
taken (and it is perhaps on these lines,
when television is a commonplace, that
opera will be best served up) is to have the
acting done by one set of players and the
singing by another, and combine the two
on the talkie screen. Indeed, one could
go further and have the singing done,
per gramophone, by the very finest ex-
ponents (vocally) of the roles to be pre-
sented, living or dead. Melba-Marion
Davies as Marguerita ; Caruso-Rudolph
Valentino as Faust; Santley-Douglas
Fairbanks as Valentine ; Biachi-Wallace
Beery as Mephistopheles—that ought to
make even the Wagnerians admit there’s
something in Gounod after all!
Country Short-wave Explorations.
On Armistice Day the ether was alive
with stations from all parts of the world
recording memorial services, and, as con-
ditions were good, reception was excel-
lent. The most outstanding was the
8.8. C. transmission from GSE, which
was good right from 10 p.m. onwards.
American stations were poor, the best
being WIXAZ in the 31-metre band.
An unusual one on Sunday afternoon
on about 25.1 appeared to be KKQ
(BolinasX
Another unusual transmission was
heard from a German station between
6 and 7 a.m. on about 29 metres —the
only English remark sent out was “Hullo,
Pernambuco.” Probably this was the
’phone station which works with WNB
in New York. It was at excellent
strength and quality.
VUB came in at 9.30 p.m. on the 11th ;
an excellent transmission at full strength
all through till midnight. Reports were
asked for, address being “Bombay
Station, India.”
The 9 p.m. transmission from RNE
was again at excellent strength on a
Sincere sympathy is extended to
the relatives of the late Mr. C. J.
Czisz, well-known and popular radio
dealer of Macksville (N.S.W.), who
passed away on November 11 last
after a short illness. He was a con-
tributor to The Bulletin radio sec-
tion, and specialised in power ampli-
fiers and short-wave experimental
work. A young man with a pleasant
personality, his untimely passing is
felt keenly by all who knew him.
recent Sunday, but the midnight session
was considerably weaker. It will, if last
year’s experience is followed, soon fade
out.
The early mornings continue dis-
appointing. Save for GSB, in the 31-
metre band, practically no stations are
of value between 6 and 7 a.m. Last
year FYA, GSD and 2RO were coming
in at excellent strength at this hour from
mid-October onwards. In the 19-metre
band FYA has been at great strength
after 10 p.m., which is an hour earlier
than last summer. GSF is quite good,
but DJB and PCJ, in the same band,
have not been of much value.
PHI ha?, been consistently good every
night with a fine programme, but there
are more talks or lectures than formerly.
Above 31 metres static has spoilt recep-
tion after sunset, and the Americans on
this band have never been any good in
this locality during daylight hours.
Apart from the short-waves there have
been just three nights in the last two
weeks with decent reception in the broad-
cast band —a pretty comment on our
local stations, and this is in a closely-
settled district! No wonder sets are few
and far between. The usual remark is:
“They are not worth bothering with here
for six months of the year.” Unfortu-
nately, this is quite correct.
NIGHTOWL.
Amateur Chatter.
How galling an effect can our Aus-
tralian weather have on the static-signal
ratio of amateur radio! For weeks 40
and 20 have been a bedlam of crackling
machine-gun-fire static, and the din has
even penetrated to 10 metres. As for 80,
well, the least said the better. Time
these cyclonic disturbances betook them-
selves elsewhere.
Saturday afternoon, 3/11 /’34, a peek
was taken at 40 to see what was doing.
In the sense of rotten operating, every-
thing was doing. First thing to assail
the ears was a hefty raw A.C. self-excited
signal being switched up and down the
bands in frantic efforts, one assumes, to
get an aerial meter to show just another
point. This went on for almost an hour.
It’s bad enough when a xtal outfit is
tuned up for long periods. Almost all of
us are guilty of this at times, and dummy
aerials should be used. Where is this
traditional “Ham spirit” some people
blare about? Next noticeable affront to
the ears was a ’phone station blissfully
radiating no fewer than seven peaks,
each powerful, but one P.D.C. and the
others R.A.C. in varying grades. All these
“carriers” were hefty, but the modulation
percentage of the intended telephony was
about a mere 10. Many reasonable ex-
ponents of amateur radio wonder just
why on earth these people who use DX
Broadcasting studio equipment—designed and manufactured by A.W.A. The
effects cabinet is shown at left for use in broadcasting studios. At the centre
back are the main studio amplifiers, while at the extreme right back is the

bands for telephony to converse with
almost next-door neighbors don’t avail
themselves of the wide-open spaces of
10 and 5 metres. By all means 40 and
20 for DX telephony, but why not the
higher frequencies for local work?
It should be remembered that now that
the public are using all-wave receivers
the amateur bands of 80, 40 and 20
metres are no longer private preserves,
and whistling into indifferent micro-
phones and “Hi! Hi’s!” cannot make
amateur radio communication edifying.
Then, on the telegraphy side, the inter-
minable CQ business still exists. If only
these long CQ’ers would realise the con-
tacts they lose by the pernicious prac-
tice! This is not a growl at amateur
radio, but it is high time some of these
things were mentioned.
Inter-State signals are beginning to
arrive strongly in Sydney after dusk on
20, and in the later hours Europeans are
well in evidence. With the increasing
liveliness on 20 things should look up on
10, as when 20 is very good 10 is
usually in the same state. Ten should
be extremely useful for cross-city tele-
phony, judging by the strength of har-
monics of 40-metre stations heard. The
10-metre harmonic is always stronger
than the 20-metre harmonic. This is
not confined to the particular receiving
location, and is confirmed by other
observers. There should be more activity
on 10.
There are many plums for the pick-
ing in overseas reading. Chief of these js
Ross Hull’s 5-metre aerial array in “QST.”
Two hundred miles on 5, ground-to-
ground station, is something to talk about.
This should give quite an impetus to 5-
metre work, even if the neighbors do
think we are crazy to erect weird-looking
arrangements in the garden. How about
Sydney to Newcastle now? “Radio”
(U.S.A.) has an article which says that,
compared with the 45, the 46 is a washout
as R.F. amp. Now there will be a rush
on 45’s, especially if they are around
4s. 6d. each. “Break-in” (M.L.) has a
good story on a 5-band Tritet or E.C.
outfit. It can be gathered, also, by a
brief par. that somebody has been
stirring things up on 5 in M.L.
VK2NO.
What’s What in Radio.
The subject of radio' interference, par-
ticularly in regard to broadcasting ser-
vices, is receiving the attention of various
authorities throughout the world. The
Institution of Radio Engineers (Austra-
lia) has been giving this matter consider-
able attention for some months, and is
now waiting on a report resulting from
the deliberations of a special committee
which will meet in Berlin at a date pro-
visionally fixed for the end of November,
1934. The I.R.E. is in touch with the
British authorities on this matter and,
appreciating the fact that it is essential
to adopt a most effective and practical
method of measuring the interference of
electrical apparatus which can be utilised
by the various countries, the result of
these international deliberations will be
carefully considered and arrangements
then made for a conference of all inter-
ested parties throughout Australia. The
Institution of Radio Engineers (Aust.) is
co-operating with the International Elec-
trotechnical Commission, headquarters
London, which is holding further confer-
ences at Berlin in November next, and,
after full consideration of these overseas
investigations, together with investigations
in America and Canada, the institution
will take action towards a satisfactory
solution of the problem as affecting Aus-
tralian broadcast listeners. It might be
mentioned that the institution has already
carried out considerable investigations,
and is co-operating with the P.M.G.’s
Department which has performed and
continues to perform valuable practical
work in all parts of the Commonwealth.

Public-address systems for amplification
at open-air gatherings contributed to
Melbourne’s centenary celebrations. At
the dedication of the Shrine of Remem-
brance 32 loudspeakers were employed,
enabling every word to be heard by
250,000 or more persons. At Laverton
20 speakers were used during the air
pageant, serving about 200,000 people.
The technical arrangements were car-
ried out by Amalgamated Wireless. The
speakers performed splendidly, and the
clarity and quality of the reproduction
were highly commended.
Iron-cored Coils Again.
“Practical Wireless,” England, in an
article on permeability and other modern
tuning systems, says: “After being
widely used for some months, the popu-
larity of iron-cored coils began to wane,
and several designers went back to the
old type of tuning coils. Now, at last,
iron-cored coils appear to have settled
down in the place they are entitled to
occupy as the most efficient forms of
tuning device available. There is no
doubt whatever that iron-core tuning is
here to stay, and that tuners embodying
this feature must eventually oust all
others. The benefits to be derived from
permeability tuning are of particular im-
portance in the ‘straight’ circuit and by
no means insignificant even in a super-
het. Iron-cored coils make it possible to
design a ‘straight’ circuit receiver which
will be amply selective for all purposes,
and which is uniformly sensitive. De-
spite the firm hold of the superhet, the
popularity of the multi-R.F. receiver may
increase very considerably in coming
months.” There is a reference which
shows that the English radio trade has
suffered at the hands of “backyarders” in
this matter of iron-cored coils. If such
coils are made in Australia, they must be
the real thing, and made to conform
strictly with such products as those of
Colvern, Ltd. Some Australian manufac-
turer with an eye to progress should
negotiate for the rights without delay.

NEW ZEALAND
Only three days from Australia tourists
find a new zest in New Zealand.
Here are inexorable glaciers; mountain-
locked lakes and fiords; permanently
snow-capped alps; almost incredible ther-
mal wonders and one of the most interest-
ing native races.
To the sportsman, New Zea-
land offers shooting, fishing,
mountaineering, alpine sports,
snow thrills. To the business
man it provides, through its
miraculous thermal springs, a
tonic for tired nerves and an
unexcelled recipe for physical
recovery. Nature has been

Casual Comment.
“S.G.” (Vic.): How’s this for freak
reception? Testing a series of crystals
for sensitivity one evening, I found one
that appeared to be exceptional. It was
placed in a shallow porcelain dish, the
aerial lead-in wire held against it by
means of a metal tie-clip, and the brass
tag of a pair of headphones as a “cat’s-
whisker.” The other ’phone tag was
connected to earth. Speech and music
were heard clearly from the local station,
five miles distant. No condenser, coils
or tuning inductances were used. [The
windings of the headphones in series
with aerial and earth probably did the
tuning, the audible station being some-
where approximate to a harmonic of
the combination. — Ed.]

“Superdyne”: Why don’t the stations
have a gentleman’s agreement about their
music? I am a lowbrow who loves Irving
Berlin and his accomplices, yet I’ll turn
dial after dial and find nothing but Bach,
Beethoven and Grieg on every station.
My wife is a highbrow and worships
these composers, but she can only get
to the radio later, when I’m working.
She is hurt beyond belief because she
finds every station turning out the stuff
I want. Surely it wouldn’t be difficult
to have a highbrow programme on one
station simultaneously with a lowbrow
one on another!

Australian song writers are beginning
to kick in Melbourne against the use of
imported records in radio. They claim
rightly that -Australian songs, some of
which have attained wide popularity in
the popular sphere, should be given a
fair spin. The prejudice which existed
against Australian goods in the past is
still existent among those in musical
authority, though the public cares not
tuppence who writes its songs so long as
it can whistle them with ease ; yet, one
or two songs which have been big hits
here were written in this country, ex-
ported and returned. One composer
tried for a year or two to put off,
say, “Down Where the Murrumbidgee
Flows,” and, failing, turned the Mur-
rumbidgee into the Susquehanna, sent it
to Lil Ole N’Yark and had it played on
a thousand bands, coming back to Aus-
tralia to be hummed from the Leeuwin
to the Line as an American product.

A lot of people concerned with the
radio trade are talking “high fidelity,”
and hoping the public will believe that
it really needs receivers classed under
this heading. According to C. Forrest,
a Sydney radio trader who has just re-
turned from U.S.A., “It looks as if
U.S.A. manufacturers were out to provide
a good excuse for increasing prices. The
only way they could describe this
improved audio reproduction to the
public was to call it ‘high-fidelity.’ ”
Ross Hull, of “QST” (U.S.A.) staff,
has stirred things up in the five-metre
world by his work with directional aerial
systems. Between Connecticut and Mas-
sachusetts ground stations are working
a strong telephony circuit over 200 miles
or so. It is fitting that Hull should be
the one to break new ground in ultra-
short waves, for his development' of the
super-regenerative reception principle
applied to these waves opened up new
fields which are now in everyday com-
mercial use. Hull is an Australian, but
four years ago became an American
citizen.

An English radio weekly publishes an
illustration of a sentry on duty at the
gates of a Moscow broadcasting station
and remarks: “Easier to tune this
station than to get in.” In contrast is
the story in “QST” (U.S.A.) for October
by an American amateur visiting Russia.
When he asked to see the inside of a
Ii Moscow station, permission was imme-
I diately given, and, although the visit
occurred outside broadcasting hours, the
I i engineers started up the lOOkw. plant
just to show how everything worked.

“V.E.”: At 8 p.m. the circuit-breaker
flew out. Engineer on watch found that
a big power unit was faulty. Hurried
: replacements were made, yet the breaker
remained contrary. Great the chaos,
rapid and intense the testing. At 11 a.m.'
next day the office boy, bringing morn-
ing-tea to the experts, spotted the fault.
When the breaker came out each time
it loosened the springs a little, and
eventually was breaking on a very small
amperage. A spring washer, a few spins
of the butterfly nut back to where it
was originally, and the aerial meter
soared once more at 11.15 a.m.

;j A practical example of the way in
which radio amateurs are able to con-
verse with foreign confreres without
knowledge of each other’s language was
demonstrated recently in Soviet Russia.
A visiting America amateur found that
the phonetic interpretation of abbrevia-
tions conveyed nothing, so he and a
group of Soviet amateurs held conversa-
tion by whistling Morse at each other,
much to the mystification and amuse-
ment of an accompanying interpreter.

Latest in the Trade.
The A.W.A. Valve Co. has sent to
all Australian experimental transmitters
a most useful radiotron transmitting-
valve chart. From this chart may be seen
the characteristics of every type of radio-
tron used for transmission, including rec-
tifiers. In order to determine the average
requirements of the experimental trans-
mitter, the co. has also included a sheet
for completion by the recipient, indicat-
ing the valves used at present in experi-
mental equipment. By filling in this
sheet and mailing, experimental trans-
mitters will be assisting the co. to pro-
vide the most needed types, and will
thus be furthering their own interests.
Thom and Smith, Ltd., makers of
Tasma receivers, do not confine their ac-
tivities to receivers for the general public.
Two special interference locators, as illus-
trated, have recently been supplied by
Tasma to the Radio Inspector’s office.
They are really very sensitive 5-valve
superhets, operated entirely from bat-
teries, and are fitted completely into a
small leather attache case for easy trans-
portation. On receipt of an interference
complaint an inspector takes the outfit
to the vicinity. Using headphones, the
“detector” is slowly rotated until a point
is reached where the unwanted sound is
at maximum. He then proceeds in a
straight line to the indicated point until
the source of interference is localised.
These Tasma interference locators have
proved to be particularly efficient in use,
and assist materially in running to earth
sources of man-made static.
The Q. and A. Column.
(1) Coil data in the circuit for the single-
valve super-regenerative receiver (“ A.R.N
13/4/’34)? (2) Would a 2-volt battery work,
the apparatus on p. 64 ( “A.R.N." 2/3/’34)?
—lB2.
(1) The quenching coil details are as given
in Fig. 3. Using I Tin. Marquis formers the
coil specifications are: 14 to 28 metres, aerial
3 turns, grid 4 turns, reaction 5 turns 26
D.S.C.; 25 to 50 metres, aerial 4 turns, grid 9
turns, reaction 7 turns 26 D.S.C.; 48 to 100
metres, aerial 5 turns, grid 18 turns, reaction
11 turns 26 D.S.C. The ranges given are
approximate, and a larger reaction coil than
usual is required owing to the series-capacity
method of feedback control. (2) No. A
6-volt battery is needed. The output would
be 180 volts at 25ma.
Voice coil impedance of the Jensen D 1
speaker ? What locally-made output trans-
formers have the correct secondary impedance
to match ? —lBO.
Write International Radio Co., 254 Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney, for information. This
firm can probably supply the correct trans-
former.
Is the matching of vario-coupled 175/cc. inter-
mediate-frequency transformers altered when
coupling is increased or decreased ? And is
the advantage of air-tuning real or theoretical ?
—179.
The matching is altered when the coupling
is varied, and the condensers will need re-
setting, but the change is not very great.
Air-dielectric condensers have the advantage,
if they are well designed, of remaining con-
stant, but some manufacturers have to-day
achieved extremely high efficiency in mica-
dielectric condensers. One prominent factory
actually impregnates the mica against con-
densation. Better selectivity is obtained with
good mica-dielectric condensers.
Where can a cheap and economical port-
able receiver be purchased ? If a new one is
beyond means, a good second-hand one will
do. —177.
Australian manufacturers have totally
neglected the portable-set business, and so far
as is known here none are made in Australia.
Second-hand ones are not to be recommended,
unless they are of recent design, such as some
of the English models. Try Colville Wireless
Equipment Co., Rowe-street, Sydney.
Can you give me a circuit diagram of an
all-electric audio amplifier suitable for gramo-
phone work, with output high enough for a
large room? —181.
./ be diagram shows such an amplifier. This
will have an output of approximately 20
watts. Input is a 24A screen-grid valve feed-
ing a 46 driver and two 46’s in Class-B out-
put. Values in the diagram are: Rl, 800 ohms
1 watt; Cl, 25 mfd. electrolytic; R 2, 10,000
s?bms 2 watts; R 3, 20,000 ohms 2 watts; R 4,
-5,000 ohms 2 watts; Tl, A.W.A. high-impe-
dance audio choke; R 5, .25 meg. 1 watt; C 7,
25 mfd. electrolytic; R 6, 1500 ohms 1 watt;
R 7, .25 meg, potentiometer; C 2, 1 mfd; C 3,
.01 mfd. mica; C 4, C 5, C 6, 8 mfd. electro-
lytics; Chi, Ch 2, 130 ma. chokes; T 2, Class-B
input transformer; T 3, Class-B output trans-
former. This amplifier is also suitable for
radio work as indicated. A type-57 valve can
be used instead of the 24A input valve.
I propose building a gramophone ampli-
fier to the enclosed diagram. (1) Are resist-
ance values correct? (2) Is the voltage divider
necessary? (3) Are resistances obtainable in
Sydney with a guaranteed accuracy of 1 p.c.
for use with a voltmeter as multipliers ?—l7B.
(1) Yes. (2) This is used as a bleeder in this
case and must be capable of carrying heavy
current. It is not strictly essential, but keeps
voltage distribution constant. If the amplifier
behaves without it, leave it out. (3) W. J.
McLellan, Bradbury House, York-street, can
supply I.R.C. resistors; or Murdoch’s, Ltd.,
Park-street, can supply Shallcross resistors of
high accuracy.
After making up a receiver from the en-
closed circuit, a Straight-forward Battery 3,
/ found that the current drain was 28ma. with
4 \-volt negative bias on the 33 pentode. This
appears to be excessive, and I am considering
rebuilding, with two stages, using a 30 and 31
in place of the 33. Would this be any ad-
vantage ? Also, with the 2-gang condenser and
coils, the tuning range does not reach to
200. How can this be remedied ? —176.
The 33 pentode needs much higher bias volt-
age, about 12| volts. This will reduce the
drain considerably. The 30 and the 31
together would take more current, but why
not use a 30 driver and a 19 Class-B audio?
With fairly high bias on the driver, to a
point where distortion begins to be noticeable,
this will be more economical. Try adding a
few turns to the coils until 2CO appears at
about 98 degrees on the dial. If this leaves
the stations at the lower end off the scale,
the coils will have to be redesigned. Larger-
diameter and finer-gauge wire will be neces-
sary.
We are unable to use a 6-valve receiver while
the house electric-lighting plant is working. The
dynamo is a Lister 32-volt 21-ampere model.
How can we cope with this interference ?■ —
183.
The trouble is due to sparking at the com-
mutator, and this can be filtered by connecting

BANISHING
STOMACH
ILLS
for over 20years
The Stomach Remedy that
does ALL the makers claim
If there is one remedy you can rely
upon to banish digestive troubles it is
< Bisurated ’ Magnesia the stomach
remedy that does ALL the makers claim,
from relieving flatulence and stomach
pain to protecting an ulcerated stomach
until healing is complete and all danger
past.
One dose of ‘ Bisurated ’ Magnesia will
stop an acute attack of stomach pain in
a few minutes. Simply take a teaspoon-
ful of the powder, or 2 to 4 tablets, in a
little water. The moment this soothing
draught reaches the tortured stomach it
begins to sweeten the sour, fermenting,
undigested food. From an excessively
acid state the contents of the stomach
become as bland and soothing as milk to
the sensitive stomach lining. The pain
quickly lessens and presently disappears.
By following up the treatment after
each meal, your harassed stomach will
lose its tenderness, it will grow strong
again until you can eat whatever you
wish, and enjoy every meal without
fear of wind and pain to follow.
GASTRITIS ENDED AFTER 29 YEARS
Mr. H. P. Martin, Corn & Seed

fered with gastritis for the
last 29 years and have had
two operations and been in 5
hospitals ... Seeing your ad-
vertisement for ‘Bisurated’
Magnesia I bought a bottle
and am pleased to tell you I
got free from pain almost at
once. I can now eat my food
without fear of pain and am
better in health than I have
been since I was 20 years of
age.” This is one of countless
cases in which ‘ Bisurated ’
Magnesia has proved its F rom a recent photo
curative power. of Mr. Martin
è
When you buy * Bisurated" Magnesia
you are not speculating on an uncer-
tainty, you are investing in a remedy
which has been banishing stomach
troubles for over 20 years. Get a
bottle, powder or tablets, from the
nearest chemist to-day and try it —
the result will be a revelation to you.

The Reward of Sacrifice.
Dancing means nothing to
me ; but May was determined to go to
the ball, and as the tickets were only two
guineas I resolved at last to make a sac-
rifice. I sacrificed the landlord and
bought the tickets.
May waited until she was sure of that.
“1 must have a fancy dress to go in,”
she said. “Give me five pounds and 1
can get everything.”
This was hot, and I said so, but ulti-
mately we compromised. I made an-
other sacrifice. It was Blobbs, to whom
a few quid was due, this time.
Then at the last moment May said
she was complete except for shoes. She
couldn’t possibly go without new shoes.
So much had gone already that when
the tears were applied I provided 30 bob,
cutting down the claim by ten. I had
to make another sacrifice ; it was Bilge
this time.
I felt a glow of virtue over all this self-
sacrifice, and when, after it was all over,
May said that it must have cost me over
£7, I told her that that was an absurdly
low estimate. Together we put it all
down, including sundries and the whisky
I had to take in my overcoat pocket.
“With fares and all that, you might
call it £10,” I said.
“Well,” said May, “if you can spend
£lO on a single night’s employment, you
ought to be able to increase my house-
keeping allowance.”
Thinking in Values.
“Eric the Red”: The Bishop of Goul-
burn gave the world some good advice
at the Anglican Assembly in Melbourne
when he observed that “our more remote
ancestors would probably have regarded
the dole as a decent income,” inferen-
tially directing attention to the necessity
of thinking in values, not in money
terms, when studying problems of
economics.
He might have gone further. The time
is not so remote when 17s. 6d. paid in
currency each week would have been
considerably more than a decent income
—in the days when Milton received
£lO for “Paradise Lost” and when
“sturdy knaves” were fined Bd. by
Draconian magistrates.
The world is gradually learning to
think in values instead of money ; but
there are still multitudes who regard)
£1 sterling at the time of the Norman.
Conquest as the same thing as £1 sterling-
to-day! Even people who ought to know 1
better speak of- the wonderful architec-
ture of the ancients having been erected’
at a time when “labor was cheap.”
In cold fact, labor never has been'
either cheap or expensive, except.at ab-
normal periods. It has always been the'
same price—the cost of living, with a 1
margin over in good times and a
margin under in bad. Cheops built
his pyramids by slave labor, but
those slaves had to be fed and housed 1
and provided with clothing sufficient to
keep them in health. If they were in!
bad health they , had to be maintained)
and treated or else left to die, which
meant that the supply of labor would-
be depleted—a thing that Cheops’s con-
tractors could not afford to allow. The
people who built the pyramids, moreover,
being slaves, had to be guarded lest they
should escape and leave the contractors
without the means to finish the job. The
guards had to be paid— i.e., provided
with food, clothing, housing and, in addi-
tion, arms, adding a cost-which the
modern contractor does not have to face.
Even with the primitive engineering
appliances and the primitive transport
of Cheops’s*day, it is probable that a
contractor would be able to erect a
similar pyramid at considerably less real
cost than Cheops had to foot. With
modern methods and plant he could turn
out a better pyramid in one-tenth of the
time that Cheops took and at one-hun-
dredth of the cost.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Horses from Randwick kept in Mel-
bourne after the V.R.C. spring meeting
picked up no tasty morsels left over
from the big feast. Locally-trained
neddies took the Williamstown Cup,
the Bendigo Cup and the V.A.T.C. Con-
solation Stakes. The last-named event,
run over a distance of a mile and three
furlongs, was worth £2500 and attracted
21 runners, including Australia Fair and
lolaus, from Sydney, and the Maori-
lander Limbohn.
“Six to 1 the field” was called at the
outset of the betting, Gothic Gem and
lolaus then being in chief demand. These
horses had finished first and second in
the Williamstown Cup ; lolaus was meet-
ing the little black on 121 b. better terms.
Shortly before barrier-rise there was a
rush of money for tile topweight, Hall
Mark, who firmed to 9 to 2.
Burlesque had been heavily backed
for the Bendigo Cup, in which he
could not finish nearer than fifth.
For the Consolation Stakes he started
at 25 to 1, nominal, and paid over £lO for
ss. on the s.o. tote. Frank Dempsey
tried to win all the way on Australia
Fair. The Heroic four-year-old faded
out between the five furlongs and half-
mile posts, where Burlesque made a bril-
liant run on the outside of the field and
assumed command. lolaus came from
second-last along the railway side to get
almost on terms with Burlesque as they
headed for the judge ; but he could not
sustain the effort. Though Burlesque

veered towards the judge’s box under
pressure, O’Brien kept him going suffi-
ciently well to score by three-quarters of
a length from Gay Star, who secured an
uninterrupted run on the rails. The
judge placed Hall Mark third, half a
neck farther off. It took only 2min.
15|sec. to cover the 11 furlongs—Usee,
faster than the previous Australasian
record for the distance.
' ' • • *
Bred in Queensland, Burlesque is by
Seremond Gay Song. In the spring of
1933 he won the A.J.C. Members’ Han-
dicap and Clibborn Stakes, and was then
sold to F. F. and Norman Robinson,
father and son. Jack Donohoe valiantly
strove to land a race with Burlesque,
Weakly supported, he finished a close
second to Upoko Ariki in the Veteran
Stakes on Oaks Day; nevertheless
Donohoe’s patrons passed the horse
along to Gerald Coffey, and Burlesque
was transferred to the stable of M.
Crossey. It has proved to be a bargain
purchase for Coffey. Of the unplaced
horses Verberry impressed most. Out
of the picture until the straight was en-
tered, he fairly flew over the last couple
of furlongs Verberry will take beating
m e St. Leger. .
Theresa Gamba fManfred—Rumex)
did nof give he 7 opponents a chance in
the Stansmore Two-year-old; she
romped home four lengths in advance of
Debham, and ran the five furlongs in
lmin. In the first division o'f the Maiden
Two-year-old a narrow victory was
achieved by Preference, who was bred
at Ernest Clarke’s Melton stud, and is
by Gilt Edge (Valais —Glittering Gold).
Lothion, who vanquished Carnarvon by
a head in the second division, is by Gay
Lothario from Fission, by Valais or
Chrysolaus from a daughter of Miss Bass,
with whom Noud captured the V.A.T.C.
Debutant Stakes of 1907.
Skidmore took the riding honors at
Caulfield by winning on Lothion and
piloting Press Gang to victory in the
Rosstown Plate. He also finished second
on Debham and third on Hall Mark.
With an apprentice up, Press Gang was
a good thing beaten on Williamstown
Cup Day. Holt acted wisely in engag-
ing Skidmore for the Caulfield event.
Backed down to 9 to 4, Press Gang
reached the judge only a neck in advance
of Ogwell.
Sydney is showing a belated apprecia-
tion of the charms of racing at War-
wick Farm. On Saturday upwards of
9000 people visited the pretty course —
3000 more than on the corresponding
day last year. There were nine races ;
O’Sullivan rode three winners (Palady,
Gentility and Irish Elegance), Lightfoot
two and Darby Munro two.
Little Bill Wedgewood, who was bred
by his owners, the Scott brothers, and is
trained by one of them—“at a dairy,”
other trainers say, with a grin—is a great
favorite at the Farm; so there were
loud cheers when he won after leading
throughout. He started at sevens. Darby
Munro tried to slow the field down, but
Winasian made his mount go at top
speed. But Winasian dropped out at
the turn, Bill Wedgewood cleared away,
and the rest was a procession. He ran
the 10 furlongs in 2min. 4sec., equalling
the course record held by lolaus. Cher-
bourg and Lancaster King filled the
places. The favorite, Roxburgh, seems
to have lost his dash for the time being,
......
Rowan is another who likes the War-
w i c k Farm track. He is trained on a
private track at Newcastle, where
D ona i(i did most of his work, and E. F.
Smith’s visits to the metropolis with him
frequently been successful and
profitable. Called at 20 to 1, and wind-
j U p at j2’s, Rowan beat the pace-
ma j cer Leone in the Leumeah Handi-
c a f ter a rousing finish ; the con-
s j stent Babili and the favorite Chat-

King , s Head ( , tQ 4)> raced m fcase ,
Foster and Manley, was always favorite
for the Horsley Handicap, and was never
in danger of defeat from the half-mile,
Misnomer and Questionnaire, second and
third, had every chance, but Leila Vale,
fourth, was not helped by Zensky, and
the stewards reprimanded, him for his
riding. Emily Rose, well backed, could
not hit the front.
‘ ' ' 1 •
Rosehill trainer Shaw, who won many
races with Lord Eudorus, was confident
that Gentility (6 to 1) would score in
the first division of the Juvenile, and she
carried out her part of the contract,
Gentility is a half-sister to Arendal, who
once downed Heroic. In the second
division Shirrob (9 to 2) and Rembrandt
(6 to 4) raced past the judge locked
together. Cablegram was third, and she
will be all the better for the race.
Fabius (14 to 1) gratified the bookies
by annexing the first division of the
Farm Novice from Middlebrook and
Morse. He is raced by Rosehill trainer
Tom Haylen. The second heat went to
Irish Elegance (8 to 1). Maoriland-
owned Palady, a stable-mate of Norman
Conquest, won a division of the Maiden
at sixes. He scored impressively, and
looks like developing into a useful stayer.
He has been rather difficult to train.
* * * *
It doesn’t say much for present-day
Westralian form that Second Wind
should still be reckoned nearly the best
of the local horses at two miles. He has
9st. 41b. in the Perth Cup, to be run on
January 1. It is four years since the
Maoriland-bred chestnut won his first
Williamstown Cup ; he is, in fact, rising
10 years, and has had a power of rac-
ing. Gordon’s Leap tops the list with 9st.
111 b. This son of Heroic-Absurla has
proved himself pretty good, but scarcely
measures up to the standard of past
Perth Cup winners—Blue Spec (1904),
Jolly Beggar (1910), Eurythmic (1919),
Lilypond (1923) and The Dimmer (1930).

“Newmarket”: Bookmaking should
have been a pleasure in Melbourne these
last two or three months, so many rank
outsiders having bobbed up, but it seems
that McShortodds is staggering under the
weight of grievances. One is tote com-
petition, another taxation. He protests
that the stamp duty of 6d. a ticket
is bad enough, but in addition
persons who bet on the nod have a
nefarious habit, after a bad day,
of doing him out of the tax they are
expected to pay, which ranges from Is.
to 10s. on wagers of £5 to £250 and
upwards. No doubt the boys would be
delighted to see the Government do away
with these methods of slugging them and
substitute a 10 p.c. tax on cash punters
who strike a winner—taking their chance
of collecting from the chaps they see
on settling day. That was Lang’s won-
derful idea. The odds-layer deducted
10 p.c., and sent it along to the Treasury
all in good time. If a fellow’s memory
failed him as to the precise amount, or
if his clerk was hard of hearing and
pencilled, say, £lO to £4 against the
winner in his book instead of £lOO to
£4O, it was the Government’s misfortune.
But it is improbable that Argyle will
copy Lang. He may be no statesman,
but he is no mug.
* * *
Though the prizes offered by trotting
clubs rarely soar into four figures, a
good trotter is often a more profitable
investment than a good galloper. For
one thing, he does not cost so much for
training or hire of jockeys; then his
track career, all going well, may last
two or three times as long. Again, if a
stallion, he can earn his keep between
racing seasons, which is rarely the case
with a galloper. For example, Walla
Walla is to go to the stud at Goulburn
(N.S.W.), but his retirement is only tem-
porary. The chances are that he will
be back on the track in a few months
and as good as ever. In Sydney, Maori-
land and' Melbourne Walla Walla has
earned a lot of money for his owner,
Martin, this year. In a race at Melbourne
he “broke” 2min. ssec. for a mile.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
People who enjoy wrestling, or what
passes for it, would like to see Sonnen-
berg meet Lurich, but the width of the
continent separates them. Sonnenberg
had a match with Meyers at Sydney
Stadium on Thursday, and was his master
most of the time ; but in the fourth round
a few blows on the Sonnenberg forehead
weakened him so much that he fell an
easy victim to a forward slam and a body
press. In the fourth Sonnenberg evened
the score, also with a forward slam and
body press, and with flying tackles he
settled Meyers in the sixth. At Leich-
hardt, opposed to Haban Singh, Nylan
repeated the now ragged performance of
diving head first on a press seat and
of being dumped for a deciding fall.
* * * *
“M. Turlutu”: If the Queensland
Government’s proposal to build a new
art gallery and public library for
Brisbane turns out to be more than a
pre-election vote kite, generations of
amateur athletes will mourn the
ing of the old Brisbane Gymnasium.
Founded by one of the Campbells who
have done so much for amateift - sport
in Q., it witnessed the successes and
the failures of thousands of aspiring
athletes. Many a famous professional,
too, trained under its roof and enabled
the lads of the village to boast in later,
portlier, wheezier days that they’d “had
’em on with Bill Squires” or Ted Nelson,
Dave Smith, Langford. A rotund and
genial Brisbane alderman of to-day can
recall hard-won amateur boxing cham-
pionships which he fought out there,
another pleasant, mild-spoken champ,
became Speaker of the Leg. Ass. It was
there, too, that a hitherto promising
middleweight gave up the game in dis-
gust when he failed in three fast rounds
to put a glove on that physical marvel
70-year-old Jack Hamilton, ex-M.L.A.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Melb.”: Densmore Shute was five up
on Leo Diegel at the end of the first 18
in the final of the centenary pros.’ event.
“It’s all over bar the putting,” said an
onlooker as the players went into lunch.
The damnable uncertainty of golf duly
asserted itself in the afternoon; Shute
putted like a rabbit. He missed two-
footers, he even missed eighteen-inchers.
His responses to the cheery badinage of
Diegel, who had never lost heart, grew
feebler, and so did his putting. Let it
be granted that he had rotten luck (over
and over again his ball rapped the rim
of the tin and failed to go down) yet,
with it all he had himself to blame on
the whole. Meanwhile Diegel was play-
ing like the phenomenon he is on his
day. He began with a two at the
sixth, and from then on never we it
wrong. He actually won nine holes run-
ning, and took the game 2 and 1. It
was the finest exhibition of the series,
and one of the finest that most members
of the gallery have ever seen.
Ins and Outs
South Australia did not greatly im-
press in its match at Sydney—the first
of the Sheffield season —with a scratch
Ma State team (Oldfield and Brown were
the only tourists in it). For N. S. Wales
Fingleton and Brown made 249 in 178
minutes; then Brown (111) was caught in
the slips and Fingleton (134) went in the
same over. Five were down for 282 ;
Oldfield and Simmons took the score to
seven for 400 (Simmons 41); at stumps
it was 7 for 422. Next day Oldfield went
l.b.w. to Grimmett at 88, and the side
was out for 479 (Grimmett 4 for 124,
Lee 3 for 70).
Richardson and Nitschke started rather
streakily. At 42 Chilvers, bowling into
a slight breeze, beat Richardson (21)
and had him stumped by Oldfield; Bad-
cock (5) was dismissed in the same
manner. Nitschke (63) threw away his
wicket in an attempt to knock Chilvers
off his length ; nobody else did much,
and they were all out for 154 ; Chilvers
6 for 67 and Hill 2 for 8. South Aus.
had lost Nitschke (24) at stumps; one
for 66. On Monday it was 4 for 139
(Richardson 44, Badcock 17) when rain
caused an interruption.

Under the Whip
The owner of Peter Pan was not
destined to receive a third trophy from
the hands of the Duke of Gloucester.
With a light boy up and a favoring wind
over the last bit, he had galloped seven
furlongs in lmin. 26fsec. on the grass at
Randwick on Tuesday morning, and this
convinced punters that he had recovered
from the effects of his severe races at
Flemington. So for the Duke of Glou-
cester Plate they sent him out at evens
in a field of 15, it being 8 to 1 (Senior)
bar 1, and 10 (Braeburn) to 50 to 1 the
others. In a fast-run race —the time,
2min. 29ysec., cut half a second off the
Randwick record for a mile and a half
—Peter was a good way back till they
surged into the straight; then he moved
forward fast on the rails. But half a
furlong or so from home Magnitas, who
had been fighting it out in front with
Oro and Mr. Kerry, came in a bit and
gave Peter a bump which settled him
and led to Carter, rider of the Magpie
gelding, being suspended for two months.
Darby Munro, pardonably agitated,
swore that Peter Pan was “home on the
bit” before he was “almost knocked
down.” He would doubtless have been
placed, but to observers from the press
stand he did not seem to be going as
well as either Oro or Mr. Kerry. They
had a thrilling set-to, which ended in
Oro’s favor by half a length, Magnitas
being the same distance behind Mr.
Kerry, with Braeburn, King March and
Peter Pan next. On his Melbourne form
there was no incentive to back Oro, and
backers allowed him to go out at 20
to 1, his longest price this year. There
was a bit of money for Mr. Kerry at
16 to 1, very little for Magnitas at 25
to 1. Pratt rode an excellent race on
the victorious chestnut.
So Hunter White collected the Duke
of Gloucester Plate, together with £l5OO
of the £2OOO added by the A.J.C. Other
A.J.C. committeemen shared in the prizes
handed out during the day, Homer, a
very promising colt by Iliad —Quadri-
lateral, owned by J. S. Brunton, winning
the first division of the Culloden Stakes,
and Sally Instep, a Ruffler —Peck o’ Malt
filly, racing in knight James Murdoch’s
colors, winning the second division.
The Duke backed Peter Pan, and got
his money back on Homer.

“D.E.”: It’s like old times to read
that a Perth morning paper published
the wrong starting time of a recent race
in Melbourne and that a knowing one
backed the winner five minutes or so
after he had weighed in. It was no rare
occurrence before wireless came along
(broadcasting ought to be an effective
check, but seemingly there was none in
this instance), and a highly respectable
newspaper became rather notorious for
blunders which facilitated these pranks.
One which shortened the difference be-
tween Perth and Sydney time by quarter
of an hour or so enabled a clever crowd
to back a scarcely-thought-of Sydney
Cup winner at long prices. On that
occasion the police took a hand, but
nothing could be proved against the
caged birds except that their luck had
been uncanny.

There were 120-odd applicants, and the
committee made its final pick from half
a dozen. The B.A.T.C. races on two

Naturally tote revenue has been de-
clining in South Aus. since racecourse
and shop bookmakers were licensed.
Port Adelaide is trying to arrest the
slump by installing a dividend indicator
and reducing the unit of speculation to
2s. 6d. in the grandstand and 2s. on the
flat. The club protests that flat book-
makers already take two-bob bets. Other
clubs are going in for this ignoble com-
petition ; eleventh-hour legislation sanc-
tions it.
Ins and Outs
As is always the case with these testi-
monial matches, players lost all interest
in the Woodfull-Ponsford benefit affair
over the last two days, and the barren
honors went to the Eleven by 7 wickets.
Brown sparkled with 102, made in 153
minutes, and Darling (55 n. 0.) and Kip-
pax (43 n. 0.) had a merry time towards
the finish. Among the bowlers Grimmett
(9 for 172) and O’Reilly (4 for 110) were
outstanding. Fleetwood-Smith failed to
show the improvement with which he had
been credited, and Ebeling, although a
sufferer from mistakes in the field, gave
no indication of ability to go through a
first-class side, which Grimmett and
O’Reilly have done time and time again.
And Grimmett may be unable to stand
up to a Test season in 1936, while
O’Reilly says he’s done with representa-
tive cricket. The selectors will have to
engage in a desperate search for bowlers.
A tempestuous November did its best
to spoil the Woodfull-Ponsford testi-

monial match. It did not quite succeed,
but at the end of the four days there
was only £lBBl in the bank. Subscrip-
tions —some still to come in—will take it
beyond £2OOO, and there were no ex-
penses, or next to none ; but a far better
result was anticipated. More thought was
expended on Charlie Macartney’s bene-
fit after the return of the 1926 Aus-
tralian XI. Four latter-February days
were reserved for it, and £2598 was
realised for “the Governor-General.”
“D.E.”: Ponsford, as well as Woodfull,
announces his retirement from first-class
cricket. This was scarcely expected, in
spite of a hint dropped in England ; and
I predict that in a year or so both lads
will repent of their decision —not that
anyone will be inclined to hold them to
it. They are both of rather full habit,
with a tendency to run to flesh, Ponsford
especially. Overmuch playing of the
game these last three seasons has natu-
rally palled on them, but it will regain its
attractions when they find themselves put-
ting on weight. Woodfull was 37 on
August 22 ; Ponsford 34 on October 19.
Quite young shavers compared with
Hobbs, who will be 52 on December
16, and Barnes, who is rising 62. Barnes
was playing in Test matches when Pons-
ford was just out of the cradle.
“Kerloof”: Marylebone has acknow-
ledged that there is “evidence of cases of
a bowler directly attacking batsmen last
season,” and is “instructing umpires” that
“any action to prevent persistent and
systematic bowling of fast short-pitched
balls at a batsman standing clear of the
wicket” will have its strong support. The
M.C.C. statement places a big responsi-
bility on umpires—“throws the whole
thing on us without telling us what to
do,” Australian umps. complain—and it
ought to be amplified with specific in-
structions as to how offenders are to be
dealt with. Are umps. to have powers
equivalent to those of a boxing or Rugby
referee? They ought to be told. Maryle-
bone is also to try a new l.b.w. rule:
“The striker is out if, with any part of
his person except his hands, he inter-
cepts a ball which, in the opinion of the
umpire, is pitched in a straight line from
the bowler’s wicket to the striker’s
wicket, or is pitched on the off-side of
the striker’s wicket, and would have hit
it.” That’s better.
“Rabbit”: A. J. Ryan, the S.A. bats-
man, was dismissed in an unusual
manner, playing for Adelaide against
’Varsity. He hit a ball between bowler
and mid-on, and began to run. The
batsman at the other end, starting wide,
got his foot in the way of the ball and
deflected it straight to mid-on. A smart
return to the bowler, and Ryan was out
by yards. Unfortunate for Ryan, but
quite in accordance with the rules.
The Nineteenth Hole
An early feature of the Vic. centenary
amateur golf championship at Metropoli-
tan was the collapse of the N. S. Wales
stars. Jim Ferrier, who performed even
more casually than usual, was licked 4
and 3 by young Smith, of Victoria, who
has already profited by the American
invasion. Smith took his time and never
let up for a second ; also, though no
giant, he repeatedly outdrove the strap-
ping lad from Manly.
Dobson’s crash was equally unex-
pected. A. W. Jackson, who is deadly
on his day, downed the Kirk-Windeyer
Cup rep. by 6 and 5 ; Jackson was actu-
ally 8 up at one stage. Weak putting
settled Dobson.
By far the most interesting match of
the day was the one between McLean
and Ryan, though the Scottish champion
never gave the Australian captain a real
hope, and won 5 and 4. Except for a
couple of lapses in the morning, the Scot
played faultless golf in all departments.
He went out in the afternoon in 3 under
par.
Hattersley was the only member of
the N. S. Wales contingent who was
consistently good. He beat the veteran
Ivo Whitton 3 and 2 on the first day,
and fairly smothered young Williams on
Wednesday, while McLean downed Ron
Smith 10 and 9.
Jock McLean is as far ahead of the
best of our amateurs as the crack Ameri-
cans are ahead of our pros. Harry Hat-
tersley, playing very good golf indeed
for the most part, was beaten 11 and 9
on Thursday, and if the Scot hadn’t let
up once or twice things might have been
worse. McLean has been an astonish-
ingly consistent player in Australia, and
he more than deserves the two gold cups
he is taking home with him. Over the
first nine at Metropolitan on Thursday
he unleashed literally flawless golf, and
he completed the round in 67. He ended
the match at the 9th after lunch with a
birdie 4.
Australia’s amateurs have one salve to
their self-respect anyhow. In addition
to being Scottish and Irish champion,
McLean has led the amateurs in the
British open for four years. He agrees
with the Americans that the best of our
amateurs are only definitely weak in the
bunkers, and that they have all the moral
qualities except concentration.
* * * *
“No. 7”: Gene Sarazen before leav-
ing Australia for M.L. was good enough
to rank the local amateurs and golf
courses. The general opinion is that he
made a poor job of both enterprises.
It would have been surprising if he had
done otherwise. He saw little of most
of the amateurs in the nature of things,
and if there is a game in which form
varies to a baffling extent it’s golf. Sara-
zen didn’t give any links a mention
except Metropolitan, Kingston Heath and
Riversdale. It was rather as if he had
put some of the picturesque inland
courses in the vicinity of Ascot in front
of Sandwich and Westward Ho! in a
classification of English links.
Other things reasonably equal, a
course like Metropolitan which
has a basis of soil can’t be as satis-
factory as one of the crack Sydney
courses-whose basis is sand.
“Oke”: The only real thrills of last
Wednesday’s centenary pro. champion-
ship games were young Martin Smith’s
"defeat of Ky Laffoon and the narrow
escape of Thomson at the hands of
Rufus Stewart, whom the Americans
call “Pop.” Stewart looked like beat-
ing the £lOOO prize-winner in the morn-
ing, but Thomson had what he called
the breaks afterwards. Thomson, like
Smith, won 1 up. Smith, by the way,
is about the youngest front-ranker now
playing in Australia. An assistant at the
Kingston Heath Club, he is barely 20.
Smith, the only Australian left in
the pros.’ quarter-finals, went down
to Leo Diegel 7 and 6 on Thursday. He
never had a real chance. The re-
maining Americans, on the other hand,
played fairly close matches, Craig
Wood beating Thomson 2 and 1 before
the biggest gallery of the day, and the
comedian Ezar unexpectedly scraping
home from H. Cooper at the 37th.
Cooper lost owing to slack putting. Dens-


ONE-INCH STRIP
SUSTAINS TWO TONS
Amazing Strength of New
Perdriau Tread Rubber
m
i \ \
One inch of Perdriau tread would suspend
a Sedan Car and six passengers! That
is amazing but a fact nevertheless. Per-
driau engineers made tread rubber
“double tough” to withstand the high
speeds of today’s cars. So great is the
strength and tough elasticity of the Per-
driau tread that a one inch strip will
sustain a weight of over two tons.
Tests on the in-
strument shown
at right prove
every batch of
Perdriau rubber
to have this amaz-
ing strength. And
in the new Per-
mu
driau, extra tread depth and width pro-
vide more of this rubber to resist the
grind of the road. Mo wonder Perdriau
sets new records for long mileage—no
wonder its tread pattern lasts longer.
FACTOR IN FLAT-
TRACTION TREAD
You can see from the section above
how the flatter Perdriau tread ap-
plies all of its surface to the road.
The increase in road-grip and re-
sulting protection from skid or slip
are obvious. Also, this complete
road-contact is secured without any
of the distortion that takes toll of
tread life. The resulting slower,
even wear keeps the pattern deep
and clean-cut for far longer—mean-
ing, of course, longer-lasting safety.
Dealers ready to fit
Never before have tyre dealers been able
to offer such surprising value. With all
its advantages this latest Perdriau costs
no more—it is still available at the lowest
prices in tyre history. Your local dealer
is now showing, and is ready to fit, all
popular sizes.
Cool-running stops
casing “fatigue"
One of the most common causes of casing’ failure
is the spreading of heat from cord to cord. In
the new Perdriau each cord is actually “buried”,,
in live resilient rubber and is completely insulated
from heat. This means that the casing “runs
cooler” and thus has a much longer life. In
addition, each cord has the qualities of tensile
strength and elasticity, balanced to a perfect
degree, allowing them to withstand the constant
flexing necessary for greater riding comfort.

more Shute and Runyan staged some
marvellous golf in the morning. Though
the captain of the American team went
round in par figures Shute actually beat
him 8 up. The winner toured the course
in 66, and won four up in the afternoon
at the 33rd.
Leo Diegel gave his worst display in
Australia in the pro. semi-finals, but he
had no trouble in outing Ezar 6 and 5.
Ezar, though a charming character and
the possessor of four of five great shots,
is not the class golfer that his unattached
comrade Thomson has shown himself to
be. He is always liable to light up ; on
the other hand, he is equally liable to
die down. His iron approaches were
lamentable on Friday.
Densmore Shute, though almost at the
U p of his form (he shot a 68 in the
morning), could only beat Craig Wood
by one up. His afternoon card was 69 —
and, like McLean, he has been round
Metropolitan in 66. Wood blew up at
the finish, doing a 6 at the 36th and
missing some sitters on the greens. Wood
and Ezar lift £lOO apiece as consolation
money, and the wisecracking Syrian was
lucky to collect his wad.
Racquet and Bawl
There will never be anything closer
than the first representative lawn-tennis
match between teams of English and
Australian girls. They finished equal
in rubbers and sets; Australia had the
odd game —108 to 107. Each day it was
3 rubbers to 1, Australia prevailing on
the first day and Britain on the second.
Neither Miss Round nor Miss Hartigan
was in her finest form, though the
English champion won both her singles
—in straight sets against Miss Bickerton
and with the loss of one to Miss Harti-
gan ; Miss Hartigan also dropped one
set against Miss Lyle. Queenslander
Mrs. Westacot't went through the tourney
unvanquished ; in singles she beat Miss
Dearman and Miss Lyle, her defeat of
the latter giving the victory to Australia ;
in doubles she and Miss Hartigan beat
Misses Dearman and Lyle. In the other
doubles the Misses Hartigan and Bicker-
ton found the Misses Round and Dear-
man too strong for them.
The pace of the White City courts
bothered the overseas visitors at first,
and the longer they played on them the
better they looked. Miss Round is
strong in every department of the game.
Mrs. Westacott’s success delighted a
crowd that has had too few opportunities
of seeing her in action, She played with
enormous vigor and exhilarating speed.
* * * *
“Jachris”: The N.S.W. Association’s
tourney kicked off in Sydney last week
with three inter-State matches: N.S.W.
against Victoria, Queensland and Vic-
toria again in a women’s match. The
Ma State’s first team had a hollow win
over Victoria by 17 rubbers to 3, but
the match with Queensland was much
closer, going to Ma by three games—
rubbers and sets even. Ma scooped the
pool by taking the women’s match
against Vic. by 12 rubbers to nil.
In the Victorian games McGrath
notched his first win over Hopman in
competitive matches, two sets to one, 4-6,
6-3, 6-2, and young Bromwich had two
good wins in straight sets over Hassett
and Kay. Of the Southerners Reg Ewin,
who has been boomed as a Davis Cup
possible, pushed Crawford to 10-8 in
the second set, but in his match against
McGrath flopped rather badly, 6-2, 6-4.
The biggest surprise of the Queensland
match was the win of Chrystal over the
former Davis Cup player Gar Moon,
6-0, 6-2. Moon improved in his other
singjles against Ferguson, beating him in
straight sets.
The 16-year-old Thelma Coyne showed
out well against Victoria ; she won both
her singles without losing a set and com-
bined well with Mrs. Hopman in the
doubles. The Victorian junior, Miss
Blick, also did well to take a set in each
of her matches, one from Miss Hatters-
ley and one from Mrs. Hopman.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Patrols in the North
“X.D.”: The Defence Department and
the Civil Administration in Canberra
have been at loggerheads over the type
of vessel to be built for northern ocean
patrol work. The Defence people want
a fast armed launch which will cost
£20,000. It would be 80ft. long and
carry five men. The civil authorities
are for a small launch to cost £sooo,and
carry two men.
Economy is a thing which Ministers
rarely practise, and here it is being pro-
posed in the wrong place. The Govern-
ment usually is wrong when dealing with
the North. If its boat is to hunt sampans
which carry crews of up to 30 men, the
sending of two men is simply courting
trouble. If the patrols are long also,
two men are inadequate for the work.
One merely needs to get a dose of
malaria or be injured at sea and the rest
will be disaster.
Then there is the sea itself. Father
Neptune is not a friendly soul up that
way. The last time I saw him perform-
ing properly he was operating in con-
junction with a bucket of wind which
twisted man-sized palm-trees as if they
were bits of string. I came down from
Daru to T.I. in a powered lugger more
seaworthy than the outfit which the
Commonwealth proposes to equip, and
the two whites who shared the trip with
plenty of native labor (which went sea-
sick at once) said more prayers in two
days than in all the rest of their lives.
The Gulf hurricane can be even worse
than the sort experienced in the straits.
The Navy knows its job. The type of
ship which it prescribes could deal with
most seas, would be amply powered and
manned, would be suitable for long, fast
patrols and expeditions, which the smaller
launches would certainly not be, and could
be adapted for war defence purposes. It
would be useful in a dozen kinds of ser-
vice for which the two-man launch patrol
would be worth no more than a cockle-
shell.
“Vic”: The Queensland abo. census
figures are not reassuring. The
12,306 full-bloods recorded last June
show a decline of 226 compared with
the year before, while half-castes in-
creased almost 11 p.c. to 4916. Two-
fifths of the half-caste increase occurred
round Thursday Island, where there is
a big Asiatic population. It would be
interesting to know exactly what kind of
half-breeds are being produced there now.
The last time I was in T.I. the biggest
boy at the native school was a gangling
person who was Fly River Papuan from
the waist downwards and had bits of
abo., Jap and Manilaman scattered
round his anatomy and perhaps a dash
of Hibernian somewhere —he was called
Paddy O’Sullivan. It isn’t pleasant to
think of a North populated by these sort
of human bits and pieces.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: In one of the usual type of
assault cases in which the defendant was
a native and the victim a European
woman, Judge Phillips remarked in
Rabaul the other day that white people
needed to be more circumspect in their
habits among Kanakas than in a white
country. Knowing my native and seeing
the pictures of some of the lady tourists
who lounge on ships’ decks in shorts the
size of a pocket handkerchief and
bathers which reveal a few square yards
of bare flesh, I wonder that the trouble
is not tenfold what it is. I am not fussy
about clothes, but any female who be-
longed to me and tried to go round in
some of the costumes which these
thoughtless women adopt to their own
danger and that of their resident sisters
would be severely dealt with. A stupid
Administration compels the native
laborer who signs a contract to leave his
womenfolk behind in his village, and he
is, unluckily, only too human. Any female
whose sex appeal strains his emotions is
running the risk of getting him hanged.
* * * *
“D.H.0.”: Most of my 60 years of life
has been spent among abos., Papuans
and other colored folk. The chief thing
in handling them is personality. A
strong-willed person will lead. He will
keep his temper, and he will get better
results than the man who has to drive
his team. The man who drives suffers
more nerve strain, and is apt to treat
his natives harshly. They in turn be-
come sullen, and only do what work
they are forced to do. Like whites, some
colored people are good and others are
bad. A kind word and smile will carry
one a long way with them. Most
appreciate a fair deal. Some will risk
their lives to help a white person who is
in danger. Two types of white people
are mostly found handling colored races.
One considers all are bad and should be
booted all the time. The other imagines
they are angels and would like them
wrapped in cotton-wool. Both are
wrong.
“R.L.”: You can’t kill some Queens-
landers! “Silent” Thompson, a settler
in the Ridgelands district, near Rock-
hampton (Q.), was falling scrub alone on
his holding. Stepping back from a top-
pling tree he tripped and fell. The trunk
crushed his leg below the knee and held
him pinned to the ground. He cut the
lOin. log off his mangled limb and
crawled two miles to the nearest help.
When the ambulance arrived the bone
was sticking out inches and covered with
dirt and leaves. Anyone who has had a
broken leg will guess the hell he suffered
while chopping that log in a sitting posi-
tion. The doctors are hopeful of saving
the limb.

COLOSEPTIC
Do you know the reason for those
frequent headaches, listlessness,
jumpy nerves, insomnia, weakness
and feeling of exhaustion ? It is
‘Autoxima/ or Self-poisoning, the
name given by physicians to the
unhealthy condition caused by in-
complete elimination of the waste
products of the body. Owing to a
flabbiness of the intestinal muscles
caused by soft foods and insuffi-
cient exercise, particles of food-
waste are left in the folds and
crevices of the intestines. Millions
of poison-producing germs breed
in this waste, the blood streatn is
polluted, and your whole bodily
health suffers.
AVOID HARSH LAXATIVES
Violent purges, habit - forming
laxatives and intestinal lubricants
may give you temporary relief, but
they will not rid you of self-poison-
ing, because they do not get at the
basic cause. Before you can enjoy
perfect health you must be clean
internally. Drink COLOSEPTIC.
Coloseptic has a three-fold action.
It not only removes the evils asso-
ciated with self-poisoning, but it
has a beneficial effect upon your
general health and looks. Firstly.
Coloseptic loosens the stagnant
waste matter from the intestinal
walls and gently flushes it right
out of the system. Secondly, it

I presume that the shooting is only being

shooters wild and to develop epidemics

“H. Murray”: Has “Tsnik Geul” fB.
19/9/’34) an answer to this? Some years
ago 15 indentured laborers asked a plan-
tation manager near Port Moresby to let
them break their time, as there was a
fight in their country. Their request was
refused, though they said they would
forego their wages. They pinched a
whaleboat and left. Their village was
150 miles away, the intervening coun-
try, hostile and very hilly, being too dan-
gerous for messengers. Drums in this
case could not have carried messages. It
was a fortnight before the Administra-
tion confirmed the news of a raid. How
did the coons know?

“Waria”: Bullion exports from Man-
dated N.G. fields put up a record in
September—3o,ooooz. valued at £191,316
—and the figures should go higher when
some of the new discoveries, like that
on Mt. Kaindi, overlooking the Golden
Ridges show, are opened up. Last year’s
explorations of new country on the
plateau above the Markham have been
swiftly followed by the advance guard
of prospectors. The Leahy brothers have
established an aerodrome near Mt.
Hagen, and it won’t be many seasons
now before the whole island has given
up its mineral secrets.

“Chinchilla”: Once Boonarga (Q.),
seven miles from Chinchilla, was not
exactly the place to take one’s lady-love
for a stroll in the moonlight unless she
happened to be armor-plated or a porcu-
pine. But the tenderest humanity may
now sit on the ground of Boonarga with
impunity. The thanks of the community
are expressed in the name of the Cacto-
blastis Memorial Hall which is being
built, the Cacto. having lived up to its
slogan “Eat more prickly-pear” with
complete success in the locality.
* * * *
“Marsh”: Graziers in the Burketown
district have been fighting the wal-
laby for years. The n.-w. coastal
areas teem with “scrubbers.” This
year nearly 40,000 scalps have been
paid for, without making any material
difference in numbers. One grazier, re-
ceiving his assessment notice from the
Pests Board, remarked, “May as well
let the wallabies have the grass ; I see
the grasshoppers are advancing on a
hundred-mile front. Let ’em come ; our
wallabies’ll soon fix ’em.” The Govern-
ment doesn’t seem to worry about either
of the jumping pests.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
After our Sir Leslie had greeted Lady Wilson
when she arrived by the Kyogle mail with
daughter Marjorie, the trio hurried off
to the Orontes to attend the Scout bridge
party. Lady Wilson says there is a renais-
sance of needlework and housewifery in the
Old Country and that almost every home has
a piece of incomplete tapestry stretched on a
frame. Two English cousins, Joan and
Dorothy Witting, are staying at Government
House with Marjorie.
Brisbane’s million-pound City Hall was
crowded for the civic receDtion to the Grena-
dier Guards Band. Members of the public,
invited to be present by the city fathers, re-
sponded enthusiastically under the mistaken
belief that the band would perform. So anxious
were they for the music to begin that they
showed unmistakable signs of boredom with
the speakers and chanted “We want the band! ”
Flying-Officer Waveriey Cameron, son of the
Stuart Camerons, of Sherwood, is on his way
home on leave from Singapore, where he has
been stationed for 18 months. Alan Cameron,
a brother, is also airminded —he is one of
Queensland’s best-known pilots.
Mignon Gray came from Sydney to join
sister Colleen, who is staying with grand-
mother Mrs. J. G. Appel. Colleen gave a
party at Lennon’s the night Mignon arrived,
and both girls wore the latest things from
Paris. Colleen wore a coque feather cape with
her ice-blue frock, and Mignon a blue ostrich-
feather cape with her frock of Patou pink.
Debs, who are to leave the shell at the
Combined Charities’ Ball are undergoing a
strict course in etiquette, and the committee
has announced that their escorts must be cor-
rectly attired in tails—dinner suits not being
permitted. To apppear tailless in the presence
of royalty seems to be an offence punishable
with death or the stocks.
Marvyn Jones is to undertake the floral
decorations at Parliament House while the
Duke is here. The Parliamentary dinner is to
be eaten to music, and Nancy Muirhead, of
the glorious soprano voice, and pianiste Bere-
nice Montgomery, who already had appeared
before royalty, are to perform.
Mrs. H. C. Richards and daughter Peggy
are in the thick of farewell teas. Betty Hen-
derson, of Gladstone, is staying with Peggy.
Peggy gave a bridge party for her guest at the
Richards’ home, and Christmas-bells and pink
phlox made the reception-rooms gay.
Ivy Plane and Arthur Sharman are to be
married on December 15. Ruby Massey got
in first with her party for them, which was
held at Rowe’s Caf6 amid baskets of blue
delphiniums and golden coreopsis.
A gown of magnolia satin and a veil of

Mrs. Archie Taylor, Roma, was matron of
honor, and Lorna Richardson was bridesmaid.
Walker Davidson, of Goondiwindi, and Bruce
Wilson, of Gore, were best man and grooms-
man respectively. After the ceremony the
bride’s parents entertained at the Club Hotel.
Wearing a colorful Spanish costume, given
to her by Dandre while the Russian Ballet was
in Brisbane, Peggy Chauncey appeared in one
of the divertissements included in the pro-
gramme of her pupils’ dance display. About
70 took part.
Mrs. M. G. Aland, secretary of the Queens-
land Timber Export Association, has gone to
Sydney, and will look in on Melbourne and
Adelaide before she returns for Christmas.
At the fifth industrial exhibition arranged by
the Girls’ Friendly Society in St. Luke’s Hall
there were about 1000 entries, largely needle-
work sections and church embroideries. Dean
Barrett opened the show in the absence of
Mrs. Wand, who is out of town.
Archbishop Wand officially opened the first
storey of St. Oswald’s Hostel, which will be
either a home for aged men or a combined
boarding-house and club for married men. The
building is Elizabethan in style. At present it
is being used as a temporary dormitory for
150 unemployed single men. The Church of
England Men’s Society gathered the necessary
funds.
Ittamar Ben Avi, editor of the official Jewish
paper in Palestine and emissary for the Jewish
National Fund in Jerusalem, addressed two
meetings in Brisbane. He has gone to Cairns.
Three ladies of the Scots delegation who
attended the centenary celebrations in Mel-
bourne have come to Brisbane. They are
Mrs. N. Craven, Mrs. G. Thompson and Miss
S. Potter. All come from Harrogate (York-
shire), but are of Scottish birth. The bagpipes
mercifully drowned the speeches of welcome.
Violet and Mabel Midson are back after
a trip to Asia.
The Women Graduates’ Association, in the
Lyceum clubrooms, entertained Una Morris,
who is to be married, and also Miss M. S.
Martin, B.Sc., a graduate of Cardiff Univer-
sity, who is collecting Australian plants. Miss
Martin’s favorite sport is flying, and she has
done quite a lot of it in Queensland.
Pretty Elsa Molle, whose father formerly was
Public Curator, and who married Stewart
Dowling Millar, son of the Rev. David and
Mrs. Millar, of Armadale, Melbourne, will
make her home in New Guinea. Elsa was
married in Melbourne, and wore a travelling
frock of ice-blue matelasse, with a hat in the
same tones. Mrs. Molle gave her daughter
away.
Mrs. Graham Drew has been tea’d consist-
ently since she announced her departure for
Hong Kong. Mrs. J. L. Selwood and debutante
daughter Marjorie staged a bridge party for
her.
The Town and Country Women’s Club was
a mass of brown-and-gold Christmas bells when
a carnival party to wind up the year was
held. President Merna Gillies and Mrs. R.
Jenyns received the guests, and there was a
musical and elocutionary programme.
Mr. and Mrs. F. K. Broadribb entertained
about 50 guests at a fancy-dress dinner at the
Carlton in honor of Mrs. Broadribb’s birth-
day. The hostess went as Elizabeth Barrett,
and the guests ranged from Henry VIII. to
a pirate chief.
Tailored in coat and skirt of grey tweed,
Mrs. A. E. Moore played the part of the
Duke of Gloucester, while Kitty Hillcoat im-
personated the Governor, and breathless debs.,
who will come out at the Combined Charities’
Ball rehearsed the turtsy which they will make
to the King’s son. Some of their male escorts
also came along for a course in etiquette, and
struggled through their piece manfully. Mrs.
L. Bedford Elwell acted as matron of honor.

wherein the glorious orchestral accom-

Joey Porter is not exactly the whole
outfit in “On with the Show,” the new
revue at Melb. Tiv., but he is the star
performer in the whole eight of the play-
lets scattered through the programme.
The little plays are thin to attenuation ;
without the weird humor of Porter they
would fall as flat as a pound of tripe.
He is a comedian of the type of Barry
Lupino and Charlie Chaplin—the silent,
stupid man who says the wrong thing in
a way that delights the audience. Then
comes the new trio of Yanks, Nice, Florio
and Lubow, acrobatic dancers who bring
with them a dance in slow-motion and a
fight in a sort of Apache dance trans-
lated into Spanish, wherein the two men,
rivals for the love of the fig-leaved and
brassiered Lubow, throw one another
about like wrestlers. There is much
dancing in the show, and much of it
good. Macdonald and Graham, not in
the least Scotch in their methods, give
some of it, and Grace Hartington, a
beauteous blonde from England, has a
voice rarely found in vaudeville. Doreen
Gray provides comedy singing and a
couple of neat comedy sketches of the
girl tough. Surrounding all are balbts
of 16 girls, well-shaped and pretty and,
what is not so frequent on the stage, well-
trained.

Among the special shows arranged by
Sydney business houses in honor of the
ducal visit the most impressive is that of
Anthony Horderns’. Practically the
whole of the George-street facade of the
premises is occupied by five huge pic-
torial panels, each a triptych. These tell
the story of Britain from Boadicea and
of Australia from Captain Cook on-
wards. The record starts and finishes
with an Alfred—the monarch who
let the cakes burn shares the first
panel with the warrior queen, Norman
William and King Harold, and on the
last Deakin takes his stand with Henry
Parkes. The Anzac landing is not for-
gotten. The whole series is painted in a
manner reminiscent of Brangwyn, with
plenty of color.

German Wool Substitutes
There has been a lot of talk to the effect
that Germany will “have to buy Aus-
tralian wool again at Australia’s price.”
Those who have seen the range of
samples of artificial materials at the
German Consulate-General in Sydney
are not so sure about it. The
things are a century ahead of the arti-
ficial wools and cottons of 1926. They
dye and mix serviceably with wool, and
they are suitable, either pure or adul-
terated with other materials, for every-
thing from heavy army uniforms to the
finest crepes and muslins.
Cost may be against them in competi-
tion with natural products ; but that will
not stop their use in Germany if Hitler
says they are to be used. And it is cer-
tain that present processes will be cheap-
ened and improved with the years.
These materials are bound to have a
regulating effect on the demand for Aus-
tralian wool. We may as well make
up our minds to it and prepare to deal
with the situation, instead of waiting till
it has dealt with us.
Glass, Barley and Beef
The threatened loss of the Belgian
market for South Aus. barley and North
Westralian beef has been averted by a
provisional agreement for a window-glass
quota which allows Belgian manufac-
turers 28.7 p.c. and British 10 p.c. of an
Australian annual consumption level
reckoned at 1\ million square feet. Of
annual consumption above that level, the
Australian manufacturer (there is only
one) is to have 50 p.c., Belgium 35.87
p.c. and Britain 12.5 p.c. Imports are
to be subject to duties of 2s. per 100
square feet British and 4s. foreign, plus
primage, which is not to exceed 10 p.c.
ad val. The Belgian share of the trade is
estimated at about £20,000 Australian p.a.
Belgian imports of Australian barley and
beef were valued at £193,800 sterling
and £81,845 respectively in 1933, and
have been as high as £316,800 and
£299,900 respectively, even during the
depression.
Australian Glass scrip suffered no
slump when the particulars of the ar-
rangement with Belgium were an-
nounced. As a matter of fact, the market
price has advanced from 525. to 625. in
a few weeks. Expectations of a bonus
issue and withdrawal of a prospectus by
a company threatening competition have
influenced the notable rise.
In England—-Now
Dr. Keith Barry, from London:
I happened to be in Lancashire at the time
of the proposed boycott. Manchester news-
papers published some extraordinary things
concerning England’s trade with Australia, not
the least of which was the statement that
“practically all films and cars used in Aus-
tralia are made in America.” I wrote
pointing out that the latest film figures pre-
sented an entirely different story; my letter,
cut to the bone, appeared in an inconspicuous
place where very probably it passed unnoticed.
The original article appeared prominently on
the leader page.
Australia House rarely replies to adverse
criticism of Australia. True enough, Mr.
Bruce bestirred himself when the Lancashire
boycott threatened to be serious, but nothing
is done about the hundred and one . small
articles of an anti-Australian nature which have
appeared recently in this certain section of the
English press. If editors knew that stuff of
this kind would be immediately followed by
a powerful retort, of a nature not to be
ignored, from Australia House, they would be
more careful about what they printed.
Australia, I think, needs a Minister of Propa-
ganda in London. It certainly needs a compe-
tent Australian journalist charged with the duty
of replying to adverse criticism. It requires also
a strong advertising campaign to sell its goods
overseas. Just returned from a thousand-mile
motor tour round England, I found it practi-
cally impossible to get a bottle of Australian
wine at a good hotel. Protests were met with
the answer “Sorry, sir, but there is not suffi-
cient demand for us to stock it.” The same
reply has been met with when one has asked
for other Australian goods.
We must realise that salesmanship is as im-
portant as production and that good fellowship
and good advertising are the essence of con-
tinued sales.
“El V.”: To the organ of the Ger-
man-Australian Chamber of Commerce
it seems extraordinary that British and
Australian shipping interests should pro-
test against the competition of two Nord-
deutscher Lloyd boats which are to in-
stitute a new line between Australia and
Asia via the Mandated Territory. It’s
not so extraordinary as that a country
which couldn’t rustle up £500,000 to
pay Lancashire cotton-spinners could
find the money to build these new vessels
“’Ang on a sec., Alf — there’s
a bonzer thriller on here!”
“appointed with the most modern con-
veniences and leaving nothing to be de-
sired in the matter of safety and speed.”

“Bittento”: “Billy See” (B. 7/ll/’34)
should be told that there is an Aussie
typewriter-ribbon on the market that
costs 2s. Non-filling, Remington port-
able size, it stands up to solid work.
* * * *
“Valerin”: Under the N.S.W. Trans-
port Act traders in country towns served
by rail are forbidden to get their goods
carried by motor-lorry. Goods for the
railway refreshment-rooms are carried
free. R.R.Rs. pay no rates, buy locally
as little as possible: sell liquor and
tobacco at all hours and, in some cases,
go out. of their way to cater for private
functions. It’s damnably unfair com-
petition with citizens who pay rates and
taxes.
* * * *
“Dai R.”: The depression seems to be
producing a depressing trade nomencla-
ture. A friend commissioned me to buy
some dried prunes. When I asked for
them the counter man said blandly,
“Sorry, but we only have dole prunes/’
In another shop I asked for cheese, only
to be told “We have only the issue
cheese.” “Relief cocoa” is a third item
I’ve struck.

A long-drawn-out wrangle over steel
pipes between the N.S.W. Government
and the Water Board has led to the

three contracts for the supply of pipes,
for £135,600 altogether, to the board,
and undertaking to set up a factory in
Sydney. The main tender is for 72in.
pipes for Prospect; they are to be of a
new type, specially welded, and Aus-
tralian materials as well as labor will
be employed. During quarter of a cen-
tury most of the States have sampled
Mephan Ferguson pipes and pronounced
them good. They have been used ex-
tensively in the Westralian goldfields
water scheme.
* * * *
“T’otherside”: The complaint about
the terrible disadvantages which Westra-
lian inhabitants suffer is curious in the
light of the “cost of food and groceries”
average issued' by the Commonwealth
Statistician. Burdens are usually reflected
in cost-of-living figures, but the weighted-
average index-figure for five W.A. towns
is 831, against the 1923-27 capital-city
basis of 1000, while for five N. S. Wales
towns the figure is 848. And whereas
W.A. costs show an increase of only 5.2
p.c. over those of October, 1914, N. S.
Wales has had a 30.1 p.c. growth.

Australian apple-growers, who have
had such a bad time the last season or
two that the Commonwealth Govern-
ment is helping them with a grant, are to
get a deferred rebate of 2d. a case on
overseas shipments in 1935, provided
space bookings are filled. Unfilled space
is to be charged for.

“Black Hackle”: I had become used
to paying two lots of income tax when
I lived in Victoria, and to going through
the farce of getting provisional motor
registrations when I crossed State borders,
and to changing trains at Albury and
Port Augusta ; but anew one has been
sprung on me since I arrived at Can-
berra. The privilege of casting a trout-
fly on the streams of the F.C.T. costs
me five bob a season ; if I cross the
border to tempt N.S.W. fish it is an
extra 10 bob. The Goodradigbee, about
30 miles from Canberra, is in N. S. Wales
(though if you weren’t told,you would
never know), and many of the fish in it
came from ’Berra as fry. But to tickle
them without a Ma State license is an
offence.
Jjc sf: sjc
The tonnage passing through the Port
of London last year was the heaviest
on record since the war except for 1929
and 1930. It stood at 56,480,000 tons
against 26,335,191 in 1919. It doesn’t look
as if there is a depression in one port.
* * * *
“G.M.”: Representatives of imported
colored cement are beseeching the Com-
monwealth to remove the duty on the
British article, asserting that no colored
cement is made in Australia. Four
years ago the building exhibition which
used to be a permanent feature in
Russell-street, Melbourne, showed speci-
mens of colored cement from two dif-
ferent Australian firms, one of which
turned out colors equal to the best
American, which is superior to the
British in effects.
* * * *
“Bobs”: It was a wise man who in-
stituted in Vic. Government schools the
“Penny Bank,” since changed to the
“School Bank.” Deposits at credit in
June totalled £279,119. The deposit is
mother’s, as a rule. Under the guise of
“my boy’s account,” mother can tender
a small coin that pride or fear of de-
rision would prevent her from putting in
an adult’s account, even if she had one.
* * * *
“G.M.”: Australian cities need some
such regulation as exists in Paris and
Edinburgh to prevent the
erection of buildings
liable to offend the eye as
well as the health of the
citizen. In the cities
named landowners are
not permitted to run up
buildings on tiny front-
ages—in central Paris
there are blocks on
which three buildings
and no more must arise.
In Australian cities, the
owner of 16 feet may
erect anything he likes
provided it conforms
with the health regula-
tions ; and, even with the
best architects in the
world, a row of differen-
tiated buildings each 16
feet wide would disfigure
any thoroughfare. Col-
lins-street “Block” is a
horrible example. Structures of the
’sixties are coming down ; the new build-
ings, _ graceful as most of them are, are
spoiling the principal street in Mel-
bourne simply because together they
amount to a mere hotchpotch.

A large carry-over used to be an
annual event in the Australian canned-
fruit trade. It got so serious in Hughes’s
time that the Government had to come
to the rescue with thumping subsidies ;
but canners are now free from anxiety
on this score. Says A. Palfreyman,
chairman of directors of the Henry Jones
concern, reporting to the shareholders
on operations for the year:
Never in the history of the canned-fruit
industry have stocks been cleared so com-
pletely. Exports amounted to 1,400,000
cases, and 800,000 cases have been sold in
Australia.
The result is shown in increased prices
for fruit at canneries and jam factories
availing themselves of the concession
allowed under the sugar agreement.
They go up £3 a ton, to £lO, for pears
and clingstone peaches, and £4 a ton, to
£l2, for apricots.


A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Farm Cove, circled by tall white, gold-
topped staves flying gay pennants ; Farm
Cove, backed by tree- and fern-clad
slopes that blossomed with frocks and
sunshades in blues and pinks, reds and
yellows ; Farm Cove, itself a burnished
grey tumble of waters beneath a grey
sky through which the sun was shining,
was the setting for the Duke of Glou-
cester’s entry to Sydney.
Along the stern lines of the Sussex
smiled a fringe of yachts bright with
flags, the light catching the blues and
reds and browns of the pullovers and
slacks of their holiday crews. Closer
to hand, behind the yachts, was a pulsing
line of rowboats, fours and eights, and
little cockleshells skippered by small
boys: everybody feeling safe as a church
because of the nearness of the keen-eyed
water police in their craft.
Eyes, thousands of them, focused on
the Royal Standard and the white pen-
nant flown by the Sussex. Now the Gov-
ernor’s barge had made its return along
the laneway of little ships, back from his
call on royalty. Up the sky droned and
snarled the aeroplanes ; at the landing-
stage bands flung short bursts of music
into the day, and naval ratings, their blue
sleeves flashing the red and gold em-
blems of their calling, marched smartly
to their positions. Captain Pope, smart
in cocked hat and gold braid, hovered
near the pontoon. On to this, with
its cerise and royal-blue draperies, its
canna-red carpet and its forest of flag-
adorned standards, stepped Common-
wealth Ministers and the Premier and his
merry men, and in their wake stepped
Mr. Lang, his broad shoulders a little
round.
In the white-and-gold pavilion—the
Mayoral fastness —Mayor Parker stood,
a modest man despite the rabbit-
skin and chains of office. Aldermen
arrived and took their stance in this
abode of place and power that was
wedded to the pontoon by a strip of red
carpet, and had stretching on one side of
it the stand in which sat their wives and
friends and the friends and wives of
politicians, and on the other the stands
whereon sat the Church and the Navy
and prominent people.
The King’s colors were brought ashore.
The sun had at last conquered the grey ;
the sky was now a blue banner reflected
in the water. Premier Stevens’s lady, in
neat attire of navy silk, arrived, with her
daughter Gwen, in wood-browns; Lieu-
tenant-Governors, Archbishops, Judges,
Consuls walked or sat. Top-hats were of
every vintage. One hadn’t been worn
since 1914 ; another hadn’t appeared since
its owner left Eton. There was nothing
streamline about any of them.
Low flew the Wapitis, swift circled the
Moths, loud snored the Bulldogs. Bang!
went the guns. A barge, all blue and
black, came between the cheering, clap-
ping water denizens. On to the pontoon
to thunders of welcome from the circling
slopes stepped a tall, broad-shouldered
young man, his Hussar’s cap red-topped,
his dark-blue uniform hung with gold
cord, a gold star on his breast. His
cheeks were tanned, and below the tan
ran the flush of health and excitement.
The Duke of Gloucester had arrived.
Bathed in sunshine by day, floodlit by
night, the Anzac Memorial has caught the
gaze and stirred the emotions of all who
pass Hyde Park. Symbolical with its
friezes, its figure of sacrifice, its well of
contemplation, it is the outward token of
memories shrined in Australia’s heart.
The dedication has been the most serious
act in the Duke’s visit to Sydney.
On Saturday morning thousands, many
of them with the dawn, poured into the
park, and long before the appointed hour
all the ground within eye range was
thickly carpeted with men and women
and children. Some even joined the
locusts in the trees. Here were mothers
and fathers, wives and widows of sol-
diers ; here were men and women who
have worked untiringly in the cause of
the sick and the distressed soldier ; here
were decorated women, now middle-
aged, who had spent four splendid years
of their youth nursing the wounded.
Soldiers, too, came, an army in medal-
brightened mufti, to take part in this
ceremony, whose chief actor must have
been a schoolboy when their own leaf-
brown suits got their first war stains. The
hour was solemn with prayer, with the
singing of the Recessional, with 60 sec-
onds of a silence clamorous of the dead
years. Not till after the Reveille
sounded did the mood of the crowd leap
to meet the laughter of blue sky, gold
sun and crisping breeze.
The surf carnival at Manly on Satur-
day was the show of the week as far as
the Duke was concerned. Other cities
have produced flag-decked streets,
addresses of welcome, balls and race-
meetings ; but none has served up a seem-
ingly limitless stretch of golden sand,
arched by a speckless sky, backed by a
line of dark pines, before it the tumbling
blue rollers of the Pacific, and 28 teams
of sun-tanned stalwarts to battle with
and play among them.
The Duke is the first of the family to
view a surf carnival, and was so de-
lighted with its brave showing that once
he left his stand to walk down on the
beach to see how it was done. The
races and the rescues amid the tossing
plumes of the surf held even beach
habitues breathless. And there were tiers
of onlookers —a mile or more of them.
The Mayor, a justly proud man, wel-
comed the Prince, who had come from
the city in a destroyer—just as well, too,
for from early morning the road to
Manly was thick with motor-cars.
A draVing of Gwen Stevens, the
Premier’s daughter. When not frivolling
in a whirl of royal entertainments Miss
Stevens is a student at the Sydney Uni.,
being in the final year of her Arts course.
She has her eye fixed on a career of
social service.
It was fun to watch late arrivals squar-
ing the shoulders, drawing in the waist-
line and arranging the general faqade for
their bow to the Lord Mayor, and then
to see their lights-out-and-blinds-drawn
look when they found the appointed place
occupied by a kidney-table and a carafe
of water. The little Mayor and his lady
had done valiant and back-breaking ser-
vice bowing two thousand or so guests
into their bail, and only left their post
for the gangway to be cleared and the
buglers placed for the entrance of the
Duke. Until that was an accomplished
fact, the nearer three than two thousand
occupants of the civic cherry-orchard,
ears alert, moved warily, hoping to pro-
mote themselves into front rankers when
the procession passed. No “women and
children first” on these occasions!
Trumpets sounded, drums rolled, and
in walked the official party, eye-dazzling
in satins and sequins and decorations,
but for all the glance they got they might
have been in sackcloth and ashes. All
eyes turned their full voltage on the tall,
young man in the dress-suit, wearing the
blue ribbon of the Garter. The party
reached the dais —a little nest of golds
and browns and easy chairs set unex-
pectedly in a plot of brilliant hydrangea.
This led, by way of gold standard
baskets and a bank of green, to a terrace
on which a triple-arched green hedge gave
the illusion of deeper and greener slopes
beyond, leading finally to an organ
bathed in primrose light. The pillars
supporting the balconies had been turned
into trees by swathings of bark, and each
bloomed with a freight of white-and-pink
blossom.
Jewels flashed. Tiaras were worn a
few of the old fence-like variety ; most,
sweet and low in the modern way. The
Lady Mayoress, the Duke’s first partner,
gleamed in white and silver brocade. Hex-
frock was further enhanced with an
ivory chiffon cape and a sweep of train.
The Premier’s Gwen was the Duke’s
second partner. Her brown frock was
of tulle, a Dryad-ish looking garment,
deeply frilled as to skirt and shoulders.
Lady Game,'who had son Philip as well
as the Governor for escort, moved in a
misty glow of pearl and silvers. Blue
in all its skyey tones was the favorite
shade of the young things. Diana David-
son chose this color, and so did Mary
Page and Noreen Dangar. Margaret
Hamilton Lewis was -a pretty dark-haired
deb. in magnolia satins; Premier Stevens’s
wife toned in with the dais in gold lame ;
Sir Nevile Wilkinson brought his
moustache, his decorations and daughter
Guendoline, looking lovely in a frock
of Titania coloring. Golden lame
was worn by State Chief Justice
Jordan’s lady; golden, too, was Lady
Poynter ; the Claude Reading lady came
forth in periwinkle blues. Captain Boyle
squired his wife, vivid and smart in mas-
tic laces. The dagger-slim Mrs. Venour
Nathan made black the most distinctive
color present.
With its 5000 guests the vice-regal
garden party got
out of hand, and
became a melee,
as it were. The
Duke, who had
commenced hi s
engagements
pretty early that
morning, didn’t
glimpse the
flowers, and saw
little of the lawns
—even the basin
of the fountain
had a thick frieze
of humans around
its edge. Short
of the treetops
humans were
everywhere.
There were acres
of flu 11 eri n g
organdies, chif-
fons and pat-
terned silk. Here
and there like
brilliant butter-
flies, like gaudy
dragon-flies, sun-
shades hovered
above their
wearers’ heads.
Lady Game, how-
ever, defied the
hot sunshine with
a brimful brown
hat. This was
worn as the com-
plement of a soft
and long frock of
coffee - colored
laces.
The Duke flew a white flower in the
buttonhole of his grey morning suit.
With him walked the tall Captain Derek
Schreiber. On the lower lawn the royal
visitor held an informal levee, and the
chosen were plucked forth for a special
word. One of the first' to receive the
accolade was John Lane Mullins, and
two of the most decorative were Faith
Macarthur Onslow, in ivory and cherry
chiffons, and Mrs. Hans Fay, wife of
Norway’s Consul-General (the deep blue
of her frock had dark furs and a black
velvet hat for contrast). Noreen Dangar
wore a silver fox of unimpeachable
family dangling from the shoulder of her
blue frock ; the yellow of broom was
caught in Ruth Allen’s hat-and frock;
Dr. Earle Page brought Mrs. Page and
daughter Mary, in frilly organdies ; Dame
Eadith Walker’s ensemble was navy in
tone ; Mrs. Tony Hordern’s frock was gay
with daffodil-yellows, and delphinium-
blues ; Mrs. W. G. Layton was smart in
black-and-white ; and Mrs. Toby Browne,
in two tones of blue, was notable. Tea
and ices were scattered about in various
marquees, but you juggled with them
standing.
The citizens of Sydney took the Show-
ground for their party for the Prince.
Here he had a chance to see the floats
prepared for his eye. Banda played,
feats of grace and prowess were enacted,
the stands seethed with excitement;
10,000 (or was it ten million?) children
made themselves into a map of Australia,
waved flags, sang songs of greeting, were
graceful, athletic and altogether delight-
ful to the Duke, who, next to soldiers,
loves children. He went out to Rand-
wick to visit the sick Diggers; he placed
a wreath of poppies on the Cenotaph
with a card in his own writing “In
memory, Henry.” And one day they
took him out to the University and
made him a Doctor of Laws. Each of
the girls on the committee of the Under-
grads.’ Association was presented and had
her hand shaken by the Prince.
The floats, a regular comet’s tail of
glory, blazed after the ducal entourage.
A harbor city of futuristic skyscrapers,
pale-buff in color, that dwarfed the
Bridge was the City of Sydney’s offering:
Botany rolled into view, dashing blue
wave and golden strand surrounded by
giant red waratahs stiff as soldiers at
attention. A replica of the Peter Pan
statue in Kensington Gardens raised a
cheer; an accompaniment was a giant
cornucopia from which spilled marrows
and pumpkins and apples. China came
into the scene with nine white horses
ridden by allegorical figures resplendent
in rich silks and imperial reds and
blues, preceding a red and jgold equi-
page whose sides were two writhing gold
dragons. A grim robot stared from the
Chamber of Manufacturers’ waggon, and
a majestic gold-caparisoned war horse be-
strode the Returned Soldiers and Sailors’.
Where the Woollahra float wasn’t pink
roses it was pink asters. It was drawn
by three silver snails driven by a cherub
in green satin, and carried a gold rose
bowl and rose queen and other symbols.
The whole 30ft. of this structure was
drenched with attar of roses, and Syd-
ney is still getting whiffs of its sweetness.
The Army and the Navy and the War-
riors of the Air combined to offer one
great, glad party to royal Gloucester.
The Palais at Moore Park was the chosen
spot. The supper-table was a triumph.
Down the length of the Duke’s crystal
table ran a wide band of red and blue
flowers, and in its centre stood a crystal
fountain that player during supper. Near
by there were round tables of glass sup-
ported by columns of rosy light and
decked with the Duke’s red and blue.
Nothing was forgotten. Before each
guest’s place was an electrically-lit crystal
bulb inscribed with a name.
A Spanish touch was introduced by
a bowered walk of white columns fes-
tooned with heavy garlands of green
leaf and red and yellow blooms. After
10 o’clock the Duke arrived. Loud blew
the trumpets, and down the roped lane-
way banked by hundreds of humans,
he walked, distinctive by his height
and the blue ribbon of the Garter.
In the company walked the Gov-
ernor and Lady Game, she in
mignonette crepe that stretched into a
narrow train. In her hair sparkled an
emerald coronet. The Charles Rosenthal
knight and his lady, Major Marr and
Mrs. Marr, who trailed black chiffons,
and Major-General Howard-Vyse were
others in the march past.
The Premier Stevens couple brought
daughter Gwen, who had pink rosebuds
in her hair ; Mrs. C. J. Pope, who was
with her Captain, wore black satin flying
a flesh-pink scarf. The E. T. Crutchleys
came from Canberra. Brigadier-General
Phillips’s lady glittered in a handsome
frock of sequins. Sunset-blue laces
proved a winner for Mrs. Boyle;
and white moire, with drapes of tulle
floating as she danced with the Duke,
was worn by Admiral Ford’s wife.
Faith Macarthur Onslow, in green, Gwen
Manchester, in gold tissue and the wife of
Lieut.-Commander Porter, of the Can-
berra, were others who kept step with the
princely pumps. One man left Molong
in the morning and arrived at the dance
shining and bright by 9 o’clock.
The A.J.C. hung out the sign of the
horseshoe for the day of the Duke’s arri-
val, and Prince Henry popped out to
Randwick for a bite of lunch with the
committee and an hour with the gees. He
went by car till the course was reached.
At the Kensington gates the State car-
riage took up the running, and to the
accompaniment of powdered postillions
and dashing Lancers the grand entry was
made. Somebody had had an inspiration
and decorated the lunch tables with
bush flowers. In other parts the scene
was lavish with orchids. Afterwards
the Prince sat in the official stand,
saw the Duke of Gloucester Plate won,
handed out the cup amidst the wildest
enthusiasm to Hunter White, con-
gratulated trainer King and jockey Pratt,
and departed for the Showground. •
Poet Laureate lohn Masefield must
have been staggered by the quantity of
authors in this city when he faced the
assemblage at the Wentworth last week.
The Fellowship of Australian Writers
had snared the great man for a lun-
cheon ; but there were musical folk and
other followers of the arts there, and
every writer seemed to have brought a
friend. Four hundred or more broke
their buttered rolls in company with
England’s chosen bard. He was most
amiable, and before and after meat
signed books and menus. Mrs. Mase-
field, who came with her lion, brought
a carnation-red hat to the top board
(and, if you are curious to know it, her
hobby is gardening).

Chatter
The biggest, flattest and most dangerous
hats could be worn with' confidence at
Caufield on Saturday, for the wind had
an engagement elsewhere. Lightweight
suits and printed silks were plentiful,
though a few tweeds appeared out of
respect for the cloudy, grey sky. Navy-
blue predominated, and coolies and
pulled-forward berets were everywhere.
Last season hats obliterated only one
eye ; this year the whole of the face is
hidden (except perhaps the chin) when
viewed from the right-hand side. Mary
Russell was in nutmeg-rippled foulard
and a little brown tarn. Mrs. A. Cairns
(N.S.W.) was attractive in a large navy
hat, her navy coat trimmed with narrow
pipings of ermine. Violet Kelly had a
neat navy beret balanced above the neat
knot of hair on the nape of her neck;
her sisters turnout included a cape made
from alternating layers of navy and
white taffeta. Mrs. Vaughan Cutten
was cool in a frock and hat of waterlily-
green. Mrs. Jack Goulding wore a hat
of the coolie school with her patterned
silk dress and lightweight navy coat.
Mrs. A. Benbow Bullock had a last
flutter on Melbourne turf before setting
sail for M.L. Her spray of pink, mauve
and blue sweet-peas toned beautifully
with her lupin-blue coat and dashing little
hat. The Otto Vetters were there from
Perth', and Mr. and Mrs. L. M. Stubbs
from much' farther afield—Buenos Aires.
Mr. and Mrs. Stubbs are intrigued with
the bookies and Melbourne’s Sabbath.
In the Argentine all betting is per tote,
and races take place every Sunday. It’s
a very noisy cheerful Sunday. The
moment the horses are away everybody
stands up and yells till the finish of the
race. In the centre of the track, the area
which corresponds to our “flat,” are the
jockey-club members with their wives and
children. There, green lawns, flower-beds
and strings of artificial lakes make
pleasant surroundings for the most
important people at Argentine race
meetings.
Hollywood in its most ambitious
moments never presented a show with
8000 legs, and that is what Melbourne
Cricket Ground revealed on Saturday
when the combined physical culture
schools of Vic. turned out a massed dis-
play by their feminine devotees. The first
surprise is that 4000 Melbourne girls
should be physical-culture pupils; the
second is that the vast majority should
prove such magnificent advertisements
for the business. It is only natural to
suppose that girls well-satisfied with their
figures should not bother about physical
culture, and fairly safe to assume that
the massed Venuses who stripped for
action on Saturday were originally in
the B and C classes of bodily pulchri-
tude. And the result was an army of
girls whose build would give any nation
pride, while scattered at frequent inter-
vals were beauties who would win
approval from Florenz Ziegfeld and
Ernest' Rolls. Middle-aged women
anxious to preserve their youthful con-
tours were surprisingly absent. Young-
sters there were in plenty, down to tiny
toddlers, but fully three-quarters were
girls from 17 to 25. The programme
comprised marches, evolutions of the
usual type, an abo. corroboree and
various dances. The costumes were pic-
turesque, but possibly a trifle too con-
cealing—to comply with Melbourne’s
Presbyterian conscience. The only stars
of the day were Gwen Taunt, who
represented Miss Victoria in a finale of
pageantry, and the magnificent Ama-
zonian girl who acted as drum-major for
the band of lady pipers.
It has been a busy 10 days at the Met-
ropolitan links while some of the world’s
best players pursued the little white ball
over beautifully conditioned greens and
fairways. There were a large luncheon
marquee, a smaller tea-tent and several
tents displaying the very best in golfers’
kit. Sets of steel shafts and piles of
shiny new balls made onlookers linger
enviously in the vicinity and wonder how
many yards a new tool would add to
their drives. Men with cameras were
seen in trees, and radio men had camps
on various hillocks on the links.
Scottish amateur champion Jock Mc-
Lean, who won the gold cup for the
centenary amateur championship, is one
of the neatest, cleanest figures who have
ever walked an Australian fairway. He’s
a young man with very fair hair, a clear
skin and white teeth. He usually wears
beige plus-fours and cap, a navy pull-
over, light-blue socks and black-and-
white brogues—clothes that look just
right. Very young Harry Williams wears
black socks and smokes cigarettes while
playing. Jimmy Thomson, with a glove
on his left hand, also puffs a cigarette,
but when he gets into a bunker parks
his coffin-nail on the grass until he gets
out of the difficulty. South Australian
Rufus Stewart is one of the pipe brigade.
Here is a Broothorn portrait of Mrs.
Jimmy Thomson, wife of the golfer
who won the £lOOO prize in the cen-
tenary open championship. She was
movie star Viola Dana, who since
her marriage four years ago has
given up both stage and screen, for she
considers that looking after a hus-
band is sufficient occupation. This is her
first trip away from the States and she’s
enjoying it immensely after having dis-
covered the joys of being an excellent
sailor. Mrs. Thomson had a pleasant
surprise in meeting Louise Lovely (now
Mrs. Bert Cowen) once more. The pair
worked together in the same Hollywood
studio and are spending as much time as
possible with one another in Melbourne.
The Fred Raes had a warm moonlight
night for their party which commenced
in their historical old-stone house in the
Botanical Gardens and continued after
supper with a visit to the Temple of the
Winds and a walk down to the still silver
lake. The duck family was up and about
in the moonlight and from force of habit
swam towards the nocturnal visitors in
the hope of breadcrumbs. Mrs. Rae
filled her lounge with masses of rhodo-
dendrons, watsonias, lupins and tall spiky
strelitzias, and supper was served on an
upstairs balcony under a huge basket of
maidenhair fern and strings of Chinese
lanterns. The newest addition to the
curator’s household is a baby black swan,
at present a ball of pale-grey fluff with
a large beak on the end of an already
elongated neck.
The young swan has a story. A few
days before the dedication of the Shrine
there was a short traffic holdup in St.
Kilda-road, the policeman on point
duty being considerate towards the
strange procession of mother swan, baby
and father swan, who took their time
to walk across the Domain-road inter-
section. They had come from the Botani-
cal Gardens to see something of the
centenary. After a look at Melbourne
Grammar School they returned across
the street, examined the fountain, and,
mother still leading, walked up to the
Shrine and discovered the pool of reflec-
tion. There they lived happily for a day
or two until some small boys (or girls)
kidnapped the baby. Later they re-
turned him, but the parent birds had dis-
appeared, and it was a half-frozen, plain-
tively squeaking youngster which Mr.
Rae rescued. He estimates that the
husky few-days-old cygnet walked a mile
when, he first set out to see the world.
A dozen members of the Power House,
which works in conjunction with Somers
Camp, had heaps of fun rehearsing a
burlesque on the Russian ballet and just
as much fun when they performed the
finished article at a dance in the Caul-
field Town Hall in aid of Somers Camp.
Mrs. Charles Wenman trained the lads,
who, in rainbow-tinted chiffons x with
rosebuds in their hair, pranced about
arching muscular sunburned limbs and
scattering according to their degree of
nervousness either ravishing smiles or
looks of grim and rather damp concen-
tration. Another interlude was a skirt
dance given by Maisie Cowper, Valerie
Wallace-Smith and Joan Govett. Camp
chief Dr. R. G. MeAdam, accompanied
by his mother, and deputy-chief George
Nicholas, with his daughter, were pre-
sent. Mrs. MeAdam wore black inter-
spersed with ninon and Betty Nicholas
was in black taffetas with cartwheel
ruchings of white round neck and
shoulders. Mrs. G. D. Kelly’s primula-
pink romaine was elaborated with lace-
embroidered motifs. Brenda Payne wore
frilled and flounced cream ninon.
Lynette Dickenson was in dusty-pink
satin and Elizabeth Allen was swathed
in the blue of lobelias.
Wives of the visiting golfers do not
often follow the matches round the links,
but a few of them have been seen every
day at Metropolitan in the vicinity of the
garden seats which command an exten-
sive view of the 18th green and fair-
way. Here is Mrs. Paul Runyan, wife of
the captain of the American team. She
is keen on swimming, riding and contract
bridge. While travelling she and her hus-
band make up a steady contract four with
the Harry Coopers. Broothorn picture.
After its feverish gaieties Portland is
once more at a normal temperature, with
an average blood pressure. It has re-
gained its habitual appetite for bacon
and eggs at breakfast, and goes early to
bed as if it had never known the experi-
ence of making merry while the roosters
were crowing. Tales of the 100th birth-
day party are trickling up to Melbourne
on the ebb tide of the festivities. H.R.H.
has a good memory for faces, which has
already been noted on his tour. Coming
face to face with Paddy Goschen he
immediately recognised an acquaintance
of his schooldays at Eton. Later Mr.
Goschen, Trevor Clarke and two lasses,
Patricia and Dorothy Shaw, went riding
m royal company along the beach. The
girls got a tremendous thrill out of the
experience. Among those invited aboard
the Sussex were the Ken McWhaes, who
were honored with a special invitation
to take a refresher in the royal suite.
Hugh MacLeod as Shire President had
official jobs to perform for Portland’s
welcome to the Duke. Mrs. MacLeod
was little Elsa Langley, attraction of
the troupe of English pierrots which
prospered in all the capital cities in the
years before talkies were thought of.
Blue-eyed fair-haired Elsa has learnt all
about chickens, knows something of
cows (maybe she sings “Little Baggy
Breeches” to them) and can master the
temperamental moments of a wood
stove.
A campaign is being planned whereby
Rose Day will benefit the Free Kinder-
gartens. Mrs. T. W. a’Beckett is presi-
dent of the Kindergarten Union, and
Mrs. M. W. Liddell is organising the
appeal on November 30, when it is hoped
no one who can spare a coin will walk
the streets without a Rose Day button
or go home without a bunch of flowers
or jar of jam. The Mayoresses of Mel-
bourne’s suburbs are giving their sup-
port. Gladys Moncrieff is lending her
persuasive powers in the Block, apd the
A.B.C. has promised donations from
community singing at the King’s.
There are over 4000 children under six
on the rolls of the combined Free Kin-
dergartens. The youngsters’ education
begins with the co-ordinated development
of mental, moral and physical attributes.
Milk and hot soup are beneficial to
little under-nourished bodies, and soap
and toothbrushes impress their worth
upon malleable young minds. At the
kindergarten many children meet beauty
for the first time ; it may be merely in
the guise of crisp muslin curtains, a vase
of flowers, fairy-tale pictures or the
smile of a well-groomed happy young
student, but the seed of aesthetic appre-
ciation is sown in the baby mind. Small
boys and girls are given a good deal of
freedom, they develop a community
spirit and understanding of fairplay, and
they seldom experience the disabilities
of self-consciousness. Games and rhythm
are important in the curriculum, and the
children learn simple prayers and hymns.
One grace, sung around small tables set
for a meal of bread and butter and jam,
cake or fruit upon attractive blue or gold
plates, includes: “Thank Him, thank
Him, all little children ; God is love, God
is love.” But many babies with tightly-
clutched fingers and screwed-up eyes,
which sometimes peep behind long lashes
at a rosy piece of apple, persist in sing-
ing, until discovered: “Thank Him,
thank Him, all little children; God is
lunch, God is lunch.”
A wedding with a north-of-the-Tweed
atmosphere was solemnised in Scots
Church by the Rev. H. N. Burns. Lead-
ing parts were played by Mrs. N. Flatau,
who changed her name in a Zulu-brown
and cream dress with pleated fulness
at the hem and a row of “This year,
next year, sometime, never” buttons
down the back. The ’groom was Captain
Scott-Scott. Afterwards guests gravi-
tated to Domain-road, South Yarra, where
Mrs. Norman Falkiner was waiting in a
black gown blown with scarlet poppies.
Margaret Campbell and Elspeth Mac-
kenzie decided that a welcome is just as
warm when served in the morning with
tea and hot buttery scones as it is at any
other time of the day or night. The
party was at Grosvenor for home-comers
and guests of honor Margaret Leitch
and Mary Sproule. Amongst those who
bridged the breakfast-to-luncheon gap
were Betty and Judy Adams, Pat Wenzel,
Joan Guthrie, Mary Devine and Elizabeth
Darling.
The attractive Dane girls have gone on
to Sydney with their trunks of lovely
clothes. Paula and Pat are very hand-
some, extremely modern young things
who arrived from England at the tail-end
of our festivities. Their home is in Lon-
don, where their parents are at present.
Their mother, Mrs. Robert Dane, is also
endowed with good looks. Their grand-
mother, Mrs. Robert Hunter, is well-
known in Melbourne and Bendigo.
A tabby cat who lives at the Apollo
Theatre has stage aspirations which
sometimes get the better of her educa-
tion and good judgment. She has de-
veloped the habit of walking in from the
v/ings towards the footlight in the middle
of grand opera, always choosing a tense
moment when the prima donna, the stage
to herself, is pouring out her soul in
song—definitely her Big Moment. But
puss stands twitching her ears and tail
until she has her applause (or its equiva-
lent in surreptitious giggling), when she
scuttles off, leaving the star to cope with
the effects of the incongruous interlude.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
TASMANIA.
The weather in the south of the Speck
smiled upon Henry of Gloucester, and
reserved its tears for his departure.
The two evening receptions at the
City Hall, given by the Government and
the Mayor and Mayoress respectively,
were quite brilliant affairs. The same
decorative scheme did duty for both.
At the first Lady Clark sported oyster
satin with long, winged sleeves. Mrs.
Ogilvie was in white crepe satin caught
on corsage and hip with silver lame hand-
made roses, Mrs. Davies in white crepe
with a small train. Catherine Cameron
was in her Court presentation dress.
Trained gowns were numerous. A dais
had been erected for the royal party with
a realistic bush-gully background of ferns
and bush trees, and the official supper
was served here, with lights shining
through sunken crystal bowls of shaded
pink sweet-peas, peonies and fern.
On the second occasion the Lady
Mayoress was in metal lame, touched
with mulberry velvet and cut with train.
H.R.H. danced twice —his programme
had had five entries the previous evening.
The race meeting at Elwick was one
of the most successful functions. The
Duke' inspected the horses, and didn’t
seem much impressed by the little mare
Sunbronze, later the winner of the Cup.
The royal guest wore a lounge suit and
soft hat, and there were no show of top-
pers and no freak frocks among the
women, who were tastefully and smartly
turned out. Mrs. A. J. Miller, wife of
the chairman of the T.R.C., wore pat-
terned georgette in grey, black and
white. Prince Henry sat with Mrs.
Miller in the stand. Mrs. Ogilvie wore
navy blue with a fitch fur. Mrs. Thos.
Lyons was another in blue. “Coolie” hats
were more numerous and amusing than
becoming. Some of the younger girls
looked well in frills and flopping pic-
ture-hats.
Launceston was less lucky than the
South in that rain poured unrelentingly
during the Duke’s short visit, and many
projected entertainments had to be aban-
doned. The civic welcome and the re-
ception in the Albert Hall, however,
were unaffected. The Mayor and Mayor-
ess received the royal party, and on the
dais was a chair which had been specially
made for the Duke of Edinburgh in
1868. The Mayoress’s frock was of
black satin with a short coatee in nas-
turtium-shaded velvet.
Private small parties were many and
various during the Duke’s week, many
folk giving dinner parties at Hadley’s
before the two big receptions. Dr. and
Mrs. J. Pearson and Elliott Lewis
and his lady also gave cocktail parties,
the Lewises to greet members of the
Duke’s staff, the Pearsons to welcome
Mrs. Pearson’s mother, Mrs. Meadow-
croft, Maoriland, who is paying her
daughter and son-in-law a visit.
Launceston’s Batman centenary page-
ant struck bad weather, and the out-of-
door scenes, so carefully set up, had to
be transferred to the Albert Hall. Much
interest and amusement was caused by
the make-up of Governor Arthur and
his lady, parson Knopwood, Batman
himself and many other historic charac-
ters. A whole street of little shops and
the Tam o’ Shanter Inn had been recon-
structed from old pictures of the village
of Launceston. The following day saw
the launching of Batman’s little vessel
the Rebecca and a “vice-regal recep-
tion” in St. John’s Rectory grounds.
Lovely old dresses and shawls, to say
nothing of headgear and marvels in the
way of waistcoats, had been disinterred
from grandmothers’ cupboards. One
complete costume was over 100 years
old.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
After a lull of some weeks the Uni.
refectory has been again the scene of a
dance, one arranged by the Uni. swimming
clubs. They sent to Sydney for prehis-
toric bathing costumes, which were sus-
pended upon hangers round the walls.
Mrs. Rex Matters was smartly gowned
in white-and-black-figured crepe. Prof,
and Mrs. H. J. Wilkinson and Mr. and
Mrs. Wood also lent the light of their
presence to the gathering.
To help raise £3OO required for im-
proving the golf links of the Mount
Osmond Country Club, Mesdames J. H.
Vaughan and J. C. Edmunds organised
an afternoon bridge party. Mrs. J. H.
Morish, in a white silk tailored suit and
white stitched hat, presented the prizes.
The Free Kindergarten committees
have hit upon a novel way of raising
money. They have taken on the catering
at the Memorial Drive during the week’s
tennis tournaments, and are making a
great success of it.
Yet another of Adelaide’s pretty girls
departs with a husband to Asia. The
latest is Gladys, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. C. L. Moorhouse, of Glen Osmond,
who is now Mrs. Bob Danter. The
bridegroom comes from Assam, India.
WESTRALIA.
The Naval and Military Club went
gay with flags and rainbow balloons for
its dance in honor of the admiral and
officers of the U.S.S. Augusta. Major
Louch, Lieut.-General Talbot Hobbs and
Major Corbett pressed the hands of the
v.-r. party, who turned up in full force.
The Mitchell lady’s gown was a shim-
mering affair of cyclamen and silver
lame; Phyllis Bryant’s chequer-board
was in red-and-green taffetas, and Molly
Lloyd’s honey chiffons gleamed with gold
lame.
After H. Gourley’s old 30-footer
Pioneer had captured the Felix Levison
challenge cup Royal Perth Yacht Club
put on an informal dance for its opening-
of-the-season. The Chinese lanterns on
the verandahs were gaily reflected in the
waters to the south. Vice-Commodore
George Gwynne was on deck ; Margot
Law spread a canvas of beige lace;
Betty Blackman, Alice Biggs and Ethel
Trigg were in the offing, and Gladys
Hadley sailed in figured blue chiffons.
H. C. Sewell and his wife gave ewe-
lamb Betty to the safe keeping of Gerald
Blake at St. George’s Cathedral. A swirl
of tulle cascaded the length of Betty’s
clinging white satins, and Madonna lilies
added a graceful touch. Olive Blake and
Nancy Le Souef trailed in the bride’s
wake carrying painted leaves which
caught their color from the gold of their
tulle and lame birettas and the pinspots
on their gowns.

When I was born into the world a maid
A kind Natician lent his expert aid;
Then when I came to play a pupil’s part
A stern Dutician exercised his art;
Because my features were not very nice
I called in my Beautician for advice.
The Ungulician kept my fingers neat,
While the Pedician polished up my feet.
Upon my hair, as straight as any stave,
The Undulician fixed a fetching wave.
When with their help a husband I had got
A sleek Nuptician tied the fatal knot.
Now, as the adipose gets on my nerves,
The Figurician tames my swelling curves.
At last, when I have earned my heavenly

The trained Mortician rings the curtain

Radio and
Various
Cultures
As the builder
of a cultural edi-
fice, the Austra-
lian Broadcasting
Commission i s
doing good work
with the roof but forgetting the founda-
tion.
It has, for example, sponsored visits
to Australia of such musical personalities
as Hamilton Harty, Adkins, the Grena-
dier Guards Band. These visits have en-
couraged an enjoyment of music, helped
improve standards of appreciation, in-
creased sales of musical works in rolls,
records and sheets. Many professionally
connected with music have got some
benefit, and many more who love music
have got much pleasure.
But music is not a high cultural in-
fluence. It might be questioned whether
it is a cultural influence at all, since its
appeal is not to reason, or intellect, or
to any creative instinct, but entirely emo-
tional. Some of the most illiterate of
nations are most musical, and musical
people are often illiterate.
However, if music is not culture it is
entertainment, and the supplying of en-
tertainment is one of the primal aspects
which radio has to consider. The ques-
tion, then, is whether culture, also, can
be, although not per se entertainment,
at least welcome to a sufficient public.
Evidence suggests that it can. The basis
of all culture is literature. In its lighter
form, as a novel, it is obviously enter-
tainment as much as music is. In turn,
the basis of literature is poetry. Un-
doubtedly this is the most cultural of all
the arts, and if the aim of the Australian
Broadcasting Commission is to advance
culture as well as entertainment poetry
must no longer be neglected to the extent
that it has been.
It is a legend that people are not in-
terested in poetry, but the evidence as
supplied by the visit of John Masefield
to Australia gives that legend the lie with
almost uncouth heartiness. Certainly,
Masefield is Laureate, but that in itself
is not circumstance to arouse enthusiasm.
The interest in Masefield has centred
primarily in his poetry, which is seldom
prosy, and, to a lesser degree, in his
prose, because it is so often poetry.
As to that interest, it has been remark-
ably active. In Melbourne 800 people
turned up to dinner, and even allowing
for the depression that attendance cannot
be entirely attributed to hunger—unless
it be intellectual hunger. Similarly in
Sydney. A university lecture could have
been booked up several times over, while
a luncheon —given by the Fellowship of
Australian Writers, recently slated on the
Red Page—had to turn away countless
applications for the 500 seats available.
These facts suggest that the Australian
Broadcasting Commission might well
consider the question of sponsoring visits
by other prominent overseas writers. An
opportunity was missed when Bernard
Shaw was visiting Maoriland ; but Ber-
nard might be persuaded to pay another
visit to the sunlit end of the world, and
this would certainly be stimulating and
entertaining, if not entirely cultural. Kip-
ling, too, would be appreciated by a
large number of admirers. He refused
an invitation to the centeenary, but that
might have been merely because the
moment was inconvenient or Mel-
bourne’s pronunciation of the word
scared him. Provocative writers such as
Aldous Huxley and others such as J. B.
Priestley might be invited, assuming, of
course, that they can speak.
Such visits could not but stimulate
culture. Consider the tonic effects, in
their respective spheres, of such visits as
those of Sarazen, Perry and others.
FRANK CLUNE.
Elstree
in Search of
England
If you want to
see an English
story depicted
adequately on the
screen you must
go to Hollywood.
The days have passed since Yankee pro-
ducers have put on allegedly English
settings with skyscrapers showing
through office windows and ice-water
contrivances beside glass-topped desks.
Hollywood uses English actors for
English parts, and every studio worthy
of the name has an English university
man as a sort of national censor to point
out anything likely to offend English sus-
ceptibilities or anything not carried out
The Marlene Dietrich mask in Mrs. Marguerite
Mahood’s exhibition of pottery at Sedon’s, Melbourne.
in accordance with English custom —the
things that are “not done.”
These qualifications for success are,
of course, known by instinct to the Eng-
lish producer. Where he falls down is
principally in his production—Elstree
producers still lag far behind American
—but details of production are not con-
sciously recognised by picture fans.
What they do recognise is bad casting.
It is rare to find even among the
cheapest kinds of Yankee pictures one
in which the best possible human ma-
terial has not been obtained to fit the
various characters. Even the man who
is pushed aside by the villain when he
tries to sell him peanuts looks precisely
the sort of man who would be selling
peanuts. Their gangsters look gang-
sters ; their politicians look politicians ;
their harlots look harlots ; their ingenues
look like vestal virgins.
Contrast what Elstree does. It pos-
sesses a remarkably good little actress in
Jessie Matthews. Jessie looks like a
waitress, a ballet girl, a suburban tart,
a business girl of the cheaper kind ; she
can depict such characters as convinc-
ingly as any woman that the American
screen can boast. But, having made a
success of Jessie in such parts, the
Elstree producer makes her play the
part of the Princess Olga or the Duchess
of Bunke in his next picture. No matter
what lines you give Jessie, it is a matter
of physical impossibility to make her a
convincing princess or a convincing
duchess.
Hollywood discovered the genius of
Londoner Herbert Mundin. He is a per-
feet Cockney type, and Hollywood uses
him as such ; it has more sense than to
give him George Arliss parts. Mundin
as Disraeli would be a ghastly joke, but
had he made good at Elstree he would
probably have disfigured the screen in
some such part.
Yvonne Arnaud is a French actress of
the first flight, but, unfortunately for
talkies in which she appears, she has
never learned to speak English without
an accent. That does not deter Elstree
producers from casting her for a por-
trayal of purely English characters. Yet,
if Garbo or Dietrich had not contrived
to speak 100 per cent, better English
than Mdlle. Arnaud, they would never
have been permitted to appear as any
but foreign characters. Tom Walls, who
is frequently seen with this lady, is a
good comedian with a sinister smile. It
is difficult for Walls to be a straight actor
and almost impossible for an audience
to accept him as a virtuous hero.
Of course, real life provides many
examples of dukes who look like green-
grocers, duchesses who look like washer-
women and vamps who look like vestal
virgins. It is only necessary to visit a
criminal court on sentence day to realise
that. But every art has to observe cer-
tain conventions of its own making, and
chief among these is the obligation to
present not individual freaks but types
standardised by frequency in real life.
Elstree’s failure in casting is all the
more blameworthy because in the spoken
drama English producers are almost
faultless in their casting. Many of the
first-class West End comedies could
be produced convincingly by all the
actresses and actors appearing without
make-up. The people are chosen with
meticulous scrutiny of faces, figures,
voices and movements, and the results
justify the care taken in ninety-nine
cases out of every hundred.
MONTAGUE GROVER.
Sentiment in
Stone
A schoolboyish
hatred of express-
ing emotion is
so inherent in
most British com-
munities that
they can boast few great public works
of art.
How it came about that an architect
with a sense of beauty and a sculptor
with poetry in his chisel and the courage
of lions in his heart were allowed to col-
laborate, with but little curbing and
meddling, in the erection of the Sydnev
Anzac Memorial is one of those great
miracles that should be accepted thank-
fully without too much curiosity. In
proportions elegant, in situation and sur-
roundings the best the City of Sydney
can afford, in conception and embellish-
ment bespeaking an unwonted unity of
purpose, this temple reflects more elo-
quently than words can this nation’s
estimate of the significance in its history
of April 25, 1915.
Few have yet had the opportunity of
seeing the interior of the structure —the
Hall of Memory ; the Hall of Silence ;
the group of statuary symbolising
Sacrifice. The Lake of Reflection (an
Oriental touch, this), in which the struc-
ture will be mirrored, is not yet com-
pleted. What the effect should be when
all is finished is foreshadowed in “The
Book of the Anzac Memorial,” issued by
the Beacon Press, Sydney. Bruce Dellit,
the architect, contributes a few words re-
garding the conception of the design.
Rayner Hoff, the sculptor, has justice
done to his work in the photographs
which copiously illustrate the volume.
Where there is so much to praise criti-
cism is perhaps a little ungracious, but
the figures which surmount the 16 but-
tresses and four corners of the edifice
have been called into question as slightly
grotesque and unfortunate in posture.
Taken singly the objection is not unrea-
sonable ; as features of the architecture,
taken in with the whole work at a glance,
these figures seem in keeping. Great
music is not all sweet melody and dis-
sonances are sometimes intentional.
SIMPLICITAS.
Current
Artbursts
At the 309
Library, which is
over against what
will be Wynyard
Railway Station,
Sydney, when it
gets built, is a show of paintings by three
girls, all of whom have talent. Appar-
ently they started out as adherents of the
Gauguin (or Badly Dented) School, with
leanings to the Pissaro (or Towel Tex-
ture) interpretation of things seen, but
were unable to draw sufficiently badly
and suffered from inhibitions regarding
dead cod and cat’s-meat symphonies. So
at times they gave it up and painted
things as they saw them. As their out-
look on life is cheery and their taste in
coloring natural and healthy, they pro-
duced in this mood of revolt against the
revolutionaries some very jolly pictures.
Margot Read scores a gorgeous decora-
tive effect in “Camellias,” and in “In the
Domain” has very cleverly caught the
atmosphere of a scene familiar to Syd-
ney-siders. Audrey Russell in “Tree Song”
realises the grace and poetry of the
eucalypt, riots in color successfully in
“Poinsettias in Sunlight” and seizes on
all the essentials in her portrayal of
magnolias. Her most ambitious effort,
“Rescue of Marco Polo,” is dreadful in
a borrowed manner. Elsa Russell is at
her best in quiet landscapes, and some
of these are painted with a simplicity and
a directness that are very charming. “She-
oaks” and “The Ketch” are sincere and
have elements of strength.
Mrs. Marguerite Mahood’s exhibition
of pottery at Sedon’s, Melbourne, com-
prises pots of every description, plaques
and ornaments —all glazed and exquisitely
colored. Exhibits include remarkable
specimens of filigree work, and there is
daintiness of design and mastery of
modelling. The exhibitor is not one of
those who take up modelling because
they cannot draw ; Mrs. Mahood, when
she was Miss Callaway, was one of the
brightest of the National Gallery stu-
dents. Perhaps the most notable work
exhibited is one marked “Not for sale”
—a mask of Marlene Dietrich, full face
on a golden ground. Another item was
also marked ‘.‘Not for sale,” but was sold
nevertheless. It attracted an English pot-
tery collector who is a visitor to the cele-
brations, and he pleaded so hard for the
forbidden fruit that the artist was
touched and accepted. He left elated,
advising Mrs. Mahood to hold an exhibi-
tion in London.
Everyman’s Library present's a mixed
artistic grill in the current exhibition of
paintings. The artists range from ortho-
doxy to extreme heterodoxy, and some
of the works of all of them are interest-
ing, if bizarre. Rupert Bunny continues
to disguise his artistic self as completely
as if he were attired in a domino. His
oil-paintings are utterly unlike anything
we know which bears his monogram.
Mostly French landscapes, they are with
a certain charm, but leaving regrets that
he had not signified his approval of
nature in the usual manner. On the
contrary, Dora Wilson exhibits half a
dozen street scenes which broadcast the
name of the artist like an amplifier. They
are good pictures, no better, no worse,
than dozens shown previously. Isabel
Tweddle is distinguished by a couple of
Gauguinesque island scenes, glowing with
color and delightful at the right distance.
Her still-life studies are less impressive.
Eveline W. Syme is 100 per cent, modern-
ist. Her “Gippsland Hillside” is revealed
in accordance with the canons of all the
great landscapists who prepare litho-
graphs of subdivisional land sites, but her
lino.-cuts atone for everything. Kenneth
McQueen’s “Storm Clouds” is an
imaginative piece—the sort of thing that
Sime might have done had he ventured
into color. Its light effect is excellent
and its composition well-balanced. On
the other hand, “Surf” shows the pitfalls
into which modernism may lead a
painter. The spume swirling on the
beach resembles nothing so much as a
spread of rubber bathmats. Vida Lahey
has given a striking still-life in water-
color and a couple of delightful little sea-
scapes in oil.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY
of a BIG-GAME
HUNTER
B y P. Boobe
Drawing's by
ARIA
I MIGHT mention, in, passing, that the
title, in part at least, is somewhat
misleading. Although I am a big-
game hunter, actually I am a small
game hunter —five feet three and a half
inches, to be precise, and 130 pounds of
concentrated courage when facing the
charge of a maddened tsetse.
1 am, needless to say, an Englishman of
gentle birth. Only Englishmen of gentle
birth ever join that exclusive band of
big-game hunters who commit their rem-
iniscences to print; for confirmation of
this it is only necessary
to ask any Englishman of
gentle birth.
Big-game hunting, in
our family, is a matter of
heredity and tradition.
One of my ancestors was
keeper of the Royal
Antlers during the reign
of the Plantagenets (I de-
rive my Christian name
from that reigning
house), whilst a second
cousin to my great-aunt
rode to hounds in the
same meet as the grand-
son of the man who
wrote “Do Ye Ken John
Peel.” Add to this the
fact that an uncle of
mine on the distaff side
once held the position of
temporary assistant taxidermist to the
British Museum, and the wild blood of
adventurous hunting that leaps through
my veins is readily explained.
Many of my readers will doubtless re-
call the sensation in big-game-hunting
circles a generation ago when my father,
who before his elevation to the peerage
was Sir Bloodwing Boobe, and a recog-
nised authority on bear-skin rugs, was
found shot, or half-shot, on the Afghan
“A matter of heredity and
tradition.”
veldt, and he has been more or less in
that condition ever since.
My father was a tall, spare man. He
could always spare the time for a drink,
and he was so tall he could shoot
giraffes through the head and keep a
level rifle —though I don’t know if lie
ever did. Whenever he sat down he
seemed a stranger among us. I only
came up to the bottom button of his
vest. Sometimes he’d look at me in a
queer way, not so much paternally as
thoughtfully.
THE ineradicable hunt-
ing trait in our family
was early evident in my
case, when, at the tender
age of twenty-eight, I
raided my first bird’s-
nest. My father sent for
me. I had feared con-
dign punishment, but
there was a twinkle in
his eye, and he seemed
quite merry—another
couple, in fact, and he’d
have been hilarious.
“Well, Plan —(hie) Plan
—(hie) Plantagenet,” • he
said. “At last you have
justified your existence,
and if you continue your
early promise you will
go far in the big-game-hunting sphere—
perhaps as far as the South Pole, where
they shoot penguins straight off the ice.”
He involuntarily licked his lips. “I
intend,” he went on, “to send you off on
your first big-game hunt to India and
thence to Africa.”
It was he who superintended my out-
fitting in a Savile-row establishment,
selecting, with the fastidious care of the
experienced hunter, the lavender gloves
without which no true sportsman
would think of following such a
thing as a spoor.
Of the vast store of his hunting
wisdom my parent gave to me
liberally prior to my departure. I
shall ever remember his parting
counsel. “Never forget, Planta-
genet,” he said sternly, his eyes
riveted on a pair of enormous tusks
off an old gnu which he had once
brought low (his enemies averred
they were “bought” low), “that you
are a Boobe! ”
THE fellow who shared my cabin
on the voyage to India answered
to the cognomenal gem of Haggis
McParritch. He was addicted to
the wearing of kilts, and he had the
boniest and hairiest knees I ever saw.
The first night out he wasjfitting
on his bunk and appeared to be in
physical distress, hawking and try-
ing to shift some phlegm. 1 ex-
pressed a polite sympathy with his
affliction, which L took to be catarrh, but
it seemed he was talking to me.
“I'm gaen oot to yon India foor some
big-gam’ huntin’,” he said, his
mouth working like an amateur
spaghetti-eater. “I ha’e on’y shot
wild weasel at hame i’ the hie-
lands wie ma fither, the laird o’
Loch Berghew. I’m sae anxious
to shootit yon striped beasties.”
By the time he’d finished I was drying
myself with a towel. After that when
we spoke together on deck, I would get
to windward of him and could safely
watch the spray off his words going harm-
lessly overboard.
I told him that I also proposed hunt-
ing the Bengal tigers.
“Guid!” he said excitedly. “Could we
nae hunt them thegither the noo?”
He seemed in need of some expert
advice, so I agreed.-

in a wind. Besides, conditions would be
windy enough when I saw my first tiger
without the elements barging in.
I had a real brainwave before setting
out. I had heard somewhere that the
natives in that country charm some
animal with music, thus luring it to de-
struction. If one animal, why not an-
other? Though we possessed no musical
instrument, Haggis’s bagpipes (I never
found out whether they go by the set or
pair) might act with the same effect, so I
got him to bring them.
We made our way at a smart hand-
trot through the impenetrable jungle,
keeping a sharp lookout for the man-
eaters that abound in those parts. We
were working that bit of jungle between
Madras and the Himalayas. Haggis had

his bagpipes slung at the “ready.” His
great bony knees had almost been
scratched by the razor-edged leaves of
the giant cactuses growing wild, as I was.
We were despairing of getting a kill when
I thought of the bagpipes.
Haggis’s face went a bright purple as
he blew the things up to their fullest
capacity, and then burst, or almost burst,
into the simple Scottish air: “Oure
bawbee birkie driegh ca’ blaw.” As it
rang through the shattered welkin a
couple of birds fell with a thud at our
feet. Suddenly there was a sound as of
a heavy body crashing through the under-
growth, and in a flash an enormous tiger
was upon us.
I seemed all thumbs that day, and
couldn’t get the buckle of my gun-holster
undone. The great cat ignored me, how-
ever, and made straight for my fellow-
hunter, who was still blowing into the
pipes. With a savage roar that almost
drowned the noise of the instrument the
maddened beast snapped his great yellow
fangs on the inflated portion of it, nearly
causing Haggis to lose his balance. I
have never seen a man fly into such a
rage. With a bellow of blind fury, like
that of a mother bereft of her child, he
fell upon the tiger, who by now was

half choked with the bagpipes, and sank
his strong Scottish teeth into its flank.
I HAD by this time got my gun out of
* its holster. Carefully selecting a likely
looking bullet, I placed it in the gun and
was just putting it up to my stomach to
shoot when it slipped out of my hand.
As the barrel hit the ground there was a
deafening explosion, and when the smoke
cleared the tiger was completely spoiled
as a going concern.
We were naturally disappointed, but
Haggis had a suggestion.
“Weel, why no’ hire yon native
bearer. Instead o’ payin’ the laddie by
the dee offer him an over-ridin’ com-
meesion on ail tigers over twa —we on’y
want twa.”
I made the necessary arrangements
with a native fellow, using the pure, aca-
demic Urdu, a language I was quite pro-
ficient in at
college. I
selected him
because he
looked b i g
enough t c
carry a couple
of tigers back
to the hotel,
where I pro-
posed, with
Hag gis’s as-
sistance, exco-
riating them.
We were to
meet this chap
the next day
on the edge of the jungle. He
must either have been half-witted or
totally uneducated, for he said nothing
to me about bringing an elephant with
him. It was this stupidity on the nigger’s
part that caused the contretemps.
I was leaning against the rich tropical
vegetation manicuring my nails, while
Haggis was idly fleaing his sporran,
when I heard what I thought was a
trumpet. There, but a bare quarter of
a mile off and bearing down upon us,
was a huge elephant, its ears flapping in
the breeze like a couple of tent-flys.
Answering almost instinctively that
hunting urge that is so strong within me,
I took steady aim and with my eighth
bullet shot it' in the howdah.
After the bearer had had his say we
pushed on immediately to Africa.
AFRICA, I am convinced, is over-
**■ boomed as an alleged paradise for
the big-game hunter. The trouble is
that most of the animals are far too
speedy.
We set out on the long trek into the
wilds, determined to do better than in
India, and pitched camp near a water-
hole in the Congo. It was there that
Haggis saved me from a terrible death.
One day as I sat on the bank waiting
for a sign of a river-horse the water
seemed to open at my feet and an enor-
mous head protruded. As the hippo,
caught sight of me he deliberately
yawned, and as I looked down the awful
cavity I felt suddenly giddy with vertigo.
I yelled out, and Haggis, who had
been preparing our repast of fricasseed
yams and walnut juice, rushed over with
a boiler in his hand. With great pres-
ence of mind he dropped it down the
hippo.’s gullet. The tremendous mammal,
with a malevolent look, slowly sank into
the muddy depths again, there doubtless
to digest as best he could our most
useful cooking utensil.
“I made a dasn for cover.”
One day Haggis announced that he
felt like some bagpipe practice, so I de-
cided to go giraffe-hunting some miles
away. 1 found, however, that giraffes
offered poor sport; not that there was
a scarcity of them —as a matter of fact,
I saw thousands. But my luck was out.
My father had once told me always to
shoot a giraffe through the left ear-
drum. I followed his instructions faith-
fully, but found that on level ground I
had to point my gun skywards to get a
shot, a position which is not conducive
to accurate shooting ; moreover the sun
got in one’s eyes looking up. It proved
most annoying, so after a week or two
of ceaseless manoeuvring I gave it up.
WE pushed on as far as Ujiji. The
name of the village was apparently
misleading, for there were certainly no
horses obtainable there. We went on,
however, to the Lake Chad district, and
it was here
that the tragic
note on which
these reminis-
cences must
close was
struck. It was
the king of
beasts that led
to our down-
fall.
We had left
the tent (which
I had camou-
flaged to rep-
resent a bush-
fire in order to
keep the wild animals away) and were
deeply absorbed in following a trail,
Haggis following one spoor and I an-
other. I had caught sight of one, a big,
powerful fellow, some little time back,
but had temporarily lost sight of him.
Haggis had his own gun and was out of
sight behind a knoll. I was most anxious
to get this lion as I had lost my shaving-
brush and wanted the dear little tuft of
hair on the end of its tail.
Suddenly feeling hot air on the back
of my neck, I put my hand up expecting
to shake hands with a broadcasting an-
nouncer. To my horror I discovered the
lion leering at me, his nose only six
inches from mine!
It was a time for action worthy of a
Boobe. Smartly side-stepping, I made a
dash for cover, getting away to a good
start. I actually led throughout the first
fifty yards, but he was gradually over-
hauling me when I thought of a ruse to
trick him. As I felt his hot breath (his
last meal must have been the tent) on
my neck, I suddenly propped, going
down on my hands and knees. Gallop-
ing too fast to pull up, the great beast
tripped headlong over me, rolling over
and over. He sat up slightly dazed, but
before he had time to recover sufficiently
I had scaled a near-by tree.
I yelled for Haggis, but a roar of
animal pain near by proclaimed that the
lion’s mate had mauled Haggis’s knee.
The lioness came into view, spitting out
a few teeth, and the last I saw of Haggis
was his splendid figure beating all-comers
across the African scenery.
Days went by, but the lion still hung
around that tree. At night he would prey,
and so would I. He gave me no chance
of getting down. When my privations
(this was my fourteenth day without a
shave or a wash!) found me getting
visibly weaker, I wedged myself harder
into the fork of the tree, and as far as
I can recall I’m still there.
Lightly Done; Gets Under the Skin:—
A DOMESTIC TRAGEDY
By Michael Roberts
“I’ve always felt a peculiar feeling
every time he looked at me ... he had
such a violent aura, my dear! And
his wife such a splendid creature, too !”
NO decent fellow, living among
comfortable people in a respectable
suburb and holding down a good
job, suddenly cracks his wife over the
head with a water-bottle when they are
quietly reading in bed together.
The male friends of George Harrison,
probably remembering similar but
sternly-controlled sadistic impulses, were
charitable enough, but his female neigh-
bors gloated over the news with volup-
tuous indignation. However, as Mrs.
Langdon-Ross observed—and surely her
name entitled her to claim such a refine*-
ment as psychic power:
“I’ve always felt a peculiar feeling
every time he looked at me ... he had
such a violent aura, my dear! And his
wife such a splendid creature, too!”
Anyway, there they were —George in
one hospital suffering from a complete
nervous breakdown, and his wife at
home in the fatal bed, with a lump on
her head half the size of the water-
bottle itself.
UOW had such an otherwise nice chap
11 as George come to do such a thing?
Of course, everyone blamed him ; but
there you are—nine times out of ten
when you are airing your views about
your neighbors’ affairs you are hope-
lessly wrong, because, after all, what

RHEUMATISM
PAIN IN THE JOINTS
Decide that you must and you will get rid of
that pain in your joints and you have taken the
first big step along the road to recovery.
The remainder of the way is easy. No pur-
gative salts, no harmful drugs, no embrocations
or rubbing oils. Just an inexpensive box of
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from your
chemist. Two pills taken with a drink of water
at night, and then, freedom from pain.
When you think of all you have suffered you
may find it hard to believe that such a simple
method of treatment can accomplish so much in
such a short space of time. Here is the reason.
De Witt’s Pills Heal
and Strengthen your Kidneys
and thus rid your body of the harmful uric acid
that has been causing the pain in your joints.
You cannot obtain results like this by any other
means, and you cannot get rid of the pain in your
joints whilst that harmful uric acid remains.
That is why De Witt’s Pills
are recommended to you. If you
will give them a fair trial pain
will quickly
disappear and
your health
will improve in
many ways.
The most
convincing
proof of the
efficacy of De
Witt’s Pills is
that afforded
by the un-
solicited testi-
monials of men
and women

who have actually used the remedy and by so
doing have banished the joint pains which tor-
tured them.
You, too, can be freed from your jpain. Your
nearest chemist sells and recommends De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills, and if only you will
take them as directed you will quickly get rid of
the swelling, the stiffness and the pains that
make walking difficult and torture you every
time you move. Your health will benefit in many
ways when you get rid of the uric acid from
your system.
RELIEF IN 24 HOURS
A few hours after you take the first dose of
De Witt’s Pills, discolouration of the urine will
prove that they have commenced their good work.
You will be able to see that the cleansing, healing
and strengthening ingredients have passed
through your kidneys and bladder. No other
medicine furnishes proof like this, and when once
you have tried De Witt’s Pills, your one regret
will be that you did not do so before.
Take them for Scalding Pains, Gravel,
Stone, Painful Joints, Stiffness, Lumbago,
Rheumatism, Backache , Sciatica . Give them
to children subject to Bed-wetting and to aged
persons afflicted by Urinary Disorders, and in
every case they will give prompt relief and
lasting benefit.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills are sold
by chemists everywhere, price 3/6, or larger,
more economical size, 6/6. Sold only in the
blue, white and gold boxes.
Beware of imitations. Be sure you ask for,
and see you obtain, the genuine De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills.

Writing from C/o. Birchup P. 0., Victoria,
Mrs. W. Sinclair says :
" Owing to a very bad attack of rheu-
matism I had to stay in bed for over three
months. During that time I completely
lost the use of my limbs. I tried all sorts
of remedies, without result , until I was
recommended to try De Witts Pills.
Then to my surprise and joy I found 1
could move my limbs after taking the
first bottle of pills. Continuing with the
treatment 1 completely regained my
health."

do you know of yourself? And what did
George know of himself—or Millie?
With Millie we' get down to facts.
She was quite a nice woman. Wasn’t
unattractive, kept the house well enough,
was a passable cook, played a good hand
at bridge, and could even grow gay over
a couple of cocktails.
But she had her little hidden ways,
and no one knew them better than
George. And George? George had
been growing steadily middle-aged. He
had thought the world a good enough
one ; anyway, it had given him a fair
deal. Then suddenly in a flash —had it?
The question oozed out of some im-
penetrable place in him. It threw him
out of his tight little world into one
intolerable desire to forget what he was.
He remembered that once he had wanted
to live madly ... to feel. Somewhere
far away he caught a glimpse of some-
one that was himself, tossing back his
hair and laughing, young, triumphant
and eager.
It was like a fly buzzing round his
brain. Never —no, not for a moment —
did it leave him, and the torture of long-
ing, the agony of hate he felt for his
middle-aged self, his way of living, lost
him sleep and destroyed his temper.
Millie, sick of his miserable face, sent
him off to a doctor, one of those jovial
chaps, who clapped him on the back,
talked about George being “taken out of
himself” —as if he could be moved from
his bodily frame by some surgical opera-
tion —and as a final cure advised him to
take up reading.
“Detective stories, mysteries, thrillers,”
he chuckled ; “you’ll get all the adventure
you want there.”
And so George started the cure. At
first he was bored, and would turn over
to the back pages to see how the story
ended. Later on, as his field widened,
he dropped that habit with a shudder for
his crudeness, and insensibly finally lost
himself in print. He read in bed at night
and as soon as he awoke in the morning ;
in trams, during his lunch hour and
with his meals at home, the book
propped up against anything handy.
MILLIE complained that she was ne-
IVI glected. “1 might as well be nothing,”
she gestured dramatically. But that
wasn’t true. You couldn’t neglect
Millie—she saw to that. She was like a
dripping tap —no matter what you did to
take your mind off her, she persisted.
At first she playfully snatched George’s
book away, usually in the middle of
some astounding mystery, or else she
hid the volume, and George had to be
kittenish with her and coaxing, and, at
last, absolutely crawl before she re-
turned it.
Then she got tired of these tactics.
She took his library tickets and went
herself to change his books. She read
them first, one at a time, while George
was away at the office.
Then her tormentings began. While
he read she teased him, talked to him,
detailed the plot, and while he was grap-
pling ecstatically with a particularly in-
volved number of suspects, deliberately
closing his mind to any choice in order
to reap the rich juiciness at the end, she
would leer, it seemed to him, right up
into his face and shout the murderer’s
name. It delighted her. She reminded
George of a vampire, with her eyes
gleaming, her cheeks pale with excite-
ment.
She also developed another little habit.
When he was nicely settled into his read-
ing she would straighten her back, pile
up the pillows behind her, and begin
to whistle. There was no tune in it;
just a long, shrill, dreary whistling that
went on and on.
“My God, do you have to do that?”
he would say bitterly.
According to Millie that was the latest
beauty treatment. Whistling took away
the ugly lines round your mouth and
softened your lips.
He implored her to leave him alone.
But, no matter where he read or how he
tried to escape, she thwarted him. Until
at last his insomnia came back, and his
desire to be alone, to escape, almost suf-
focated him.
THEN it happened. All day he had felt
funny. His head went round, he ached
to be home relaxed in bed, slowly slip-
ping away into the life and movement
that enveloped the creatures of the newest
thriller.
He and Millie were lying in bed, the
table lamp discreetly placed. The day
fell away from him as he flicked the
pages over —he was away, far away, one
of a house-party in a splendid English
castle, making witty remarks to lovely
ladies while the corpse of the owner
lay in the next room.
And then that devil started. She leaned
upon her elbow, grinning into his face,
her rather large hand splaying over the
page he was reading. Every time he
brushed it away she put it back. He
turned to smile to soothe her, but his
quietness seemed to arouse her to fury.
She rumpled his hair, knocked the
book out of his hand, and once even
dislodged his false plate. Then with
that silly smile still tearing her face she
let him take the book again—only to
lean over him chanting “I’ll tell you
who’s the murderer. I’ll tell you who did
it. I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you.”
IT was the end. His hand flew out and
struck the half-filled water-bottle on
the table beside the bed. His spirit swept
into darkness . . . beyond darkness . . .
the silly mouth seemed to swim before
his eyes . . . and Millie’s skull and the
water-bottle met in a crack that knocked
her clean out of bed and into a mystery
world of her own ; while George slipped
finally into his complete nervous break-
down.
The Trees.
And when there is no word more that I can
say,
No last defence for my frail lost city of
thought,
Still the trees I have planted here may be
windblown and gay,
And a surer way to the loveliness blind eyes
sought.
When hope as body of mine shall be fallen
in dust,
Still the full blue cups on a lassiandra tree
Were a flagon of beauty the tired heart might
trust . . .
There may be some content with the rose-
mary.
And the tiny leaves of a maple shall glisten
wet,
Or a young laburnum loose bright tresses
of gold . . .
For the vanquished man shall leave his impress
yet
On that beloved country he might not hold.

Princess, we mourn, the while we praise
That long-dead maid so debonair
For whom men wrought the fiery maze
Of brands high-heaped in Rouen-square;
But many a maid such doom did bear
Whose beauty failed her fame to find —
Whose ghost hath graced no poet’s prayer—
Blossoms that blow before the wind.

So many dames of bygone days,
In silks and purples brave with vair,
Who smiled and swept by stately ways,
’Mid tossing plumes and trumpet’s blare,
Have hanged for carrion-crows to tear,
Or toiled, to thraldom’s scourge assigned:
And passed like leaves on autumn’s air—
Blossoms that blow before the wind!

And she whom Dante’s song could raise
To worlds beyond that threefold stair
He climbed through Love’s and Life’s delays,
From hell to heaven, and found her there,
With gold-crowned virgins round her chair,
And haloed brows of calm inclined:
Must we this lady’s charms declare
Blossoms that blow before the wind?
IV.
Who knows through what strange woodland
strays
Sad Melisande, crazed with care?
Or where sly Lilith smiles and stays,
With wanton wiles, to spread the snare
She weaves from her own golden hair,
The hearts of lovesick youths to bind?
But each with each their fate shall share—
Blossoms that blow before the wind.
V.
Where are they now (in fulsome phrase
We ask), those charms so rich and rare,
Which saw proud Ilium’s streets ablaze
When Sparta smote, nor stayed to spare?
Helen! thy beauty, past compare,
In all men’s hearts still stands enshrined:
Yet were they sisters all, we swear,
Blossoms that blow before the wind.

For some, we know, were false as fair
And some were cruel, and some were kind:
But, Princess, each and all they were
Blossoms that blow before the wind.

My Political
Life
By W. A.HOLMAN
Genesis of Inner Group
T yranny.
THE conference which decided that
the Federal Parliament should be
given the fullest industrial powers
now proceeded to go the whole hog.
Resolutions were carried of a kind never
known in the Labor movement before,
actually forbidding, on pain of expul-
sion, all public expressions of doubt as
to the plenary inspiration of the pro-
posed amendments to the Constitution.
The movement here arrived at a point
of critical importance in its history.
It was then, really, that Labor turned
its back on the principle of free speech
—till then a fundamental with the party.
It was the first time that the alternatives
of conversion or the sword had been
promulgated, or expulsion made the
penalty for dissent. It was, too, the first
time that an effort was made to fix on
members of Parliament adherence to
doctrines to which they had not com-
mitted themselves before their consti-
tuents. 'lt destroyed the constitutional
position of all Labor members, State or
Federal.
For it cannot be too clearly empha-
sised that the amendments now being
propounded were not amendments to be
found in the platform upon which any
of us, State or Federal men, had been
elected. That platform contained the
proposals adopted at the Brisbane Con-
ference and no others. To these, pos-
sibly, every Labor man had bound him-
self by the mere, act of becoming a Labor
candidate and accepting the Labor plat-
form which in-
eluded them,
though in those
days even that was
doubtful, as it was
disputed whether
State men were
bound by the Fed-
eral platform, and
vice versa. It was
now laid down for
the first time that a
mere resolution of
the conference in-
culcating some de-
cision to which
none of us as in-
dividuals had ever
given our assent'
could compel that
assent.

TT ill that Wat-
son, who had been

pal workers at the

ence in bringing

up to the unanimous adoption of the
platform there, should now be a party to
this breach of faith.
We were prepared for such aberrations
on the part of Fisher, who was a con-
scientious but puzzle-headed man, and
of Hughes, who, as a brilliant opportu-
nist, was largely indifferent, so long as
he gained his immediate purpose, to its
ultimate effect on the character of the
movement. But we had hoped for better
things from Watson, who was a man of
high principle
and clear intel-
lect. The iron
of these events
entered into
e v e r y b ody’s
soul, and it
was a year or
two before we

issue, against all of us, and Hughes and
Watson themselves were expelled from
the movement for refusing to accept the
decision of a conference on a matter not
on our platform, it was the lesson learned
in 1911 that then bore fruit. Exactly the
same arguments that had been used by
Hughes and Watson against the min-
ority in 1911 were repeated in 1916. In
1916 the same arguments and the same
action led to the disruption and decad-
ence of the movement, from which it

manent recovery.

urged, in the
right. We were
loyal to the
p 1 a tform of
the movement
which we had
i n d i v idually
accepted. Why
not treat the decision of conference as
the nullity it was, and go round the
country openly opposing the Federal
Government’s scheme?
This view was vigorously combated by
Macdonell and Griffith, who had always
been Federalists. They were, in the
phraseology of the period, “Big Austra-
lians” ; that is, they believed in unifica-
tion and the gradual painless extinction
of State government. In the present
issue they were naturally on the side of
the angels and, incidentally, of the organ-
isation. Although
they showed every
fraternal sympathy
with us in our
special grievances,
they could not be
expected to support
an actual break-
away.
The influence of
our leader, too, was
cast as usual for
u n d i s criminating
loyalty. The whole
duty of man was
for him summed up
in the six words,
“To be true to the
movement,” and
this duty he ac-
cepted at any cost
to his own suscep-
tibilities or prestige.
Still, these were
the only three out
of ten who were on
that side, and such
was the influence
of Neilsen, and
such the special im-
portance attach-
i n g at the
moment to the opinions of Beeby and
myself, as the Cabinet’s only legal minds,
that I do not doubt that if things had
remained so we three could, in our then
mood of violent resentment, have swept
our colleagues off their feet into some
public demonstration of defiance.
DACEY’S
ADVICE
At this point,
however, Dacey,
still a private
member, inter-
vened. He and I and Neilsen had
been on terms of special intimacy
in connection with the party’s affairs
for many years, and his non-in-
clusion in the Ministry had been a
grave disappointment. He now urged
on Neilsen and myself an unhesitating
acceptance of the conference’s decisions.
“Most probably,” said he, “the Fed-
eral proposals will fail. If they fail
after a fair run, the responsibility for
failure will rsst upon the Federal men.
If they fail and the Federal men can
attribute that failure to opposition
offered by us, we shall become the scape-
goats for the disappointment and anger
of all hands, and no arguments based
upon the technical correctness of our
attitude will avail. There is no higher

court than the conference —except per-
haps the Inter-State Conference, which
will be still more hostile. There is no
appeal beyond Caesar. It is no use being
right if Caesar says you are wrong. To
resist now means severing our whole
connection with the movement and
abandoning our whole life’s work. Are
we prepared for that?
“On the other hand, the proposals may
be carried, though that is not likely.
Well, let us face that. If they are car-
ried, we three, at any rate, will take it
as an intimation that State politics are
no longer wanted in Australia. We three
will seek election to the Federal Parlia-
ment and remake our careers there. And,
believe me,” he added grimly, “some of
the Federal numskulls who have been
foremost in this agitation will be the
least gratified persons in the world to
see us coming in there.”
THAT we did this is now a matter of
history. Special efforts were made by
the Liberals to get us to make further
utterances against the Fisher-Hughes
scheme, but unsuccessfully. We were
taunted with having been coerced into
an ignoble silence by the threats of the
organisation. These taunts were par-
ticularly galling because they were true.
After our leader’s departure to Lon-
don, which occurred a little later, special
and personal overtures were made to me.
I received, too, much bad advice from
people who supposed themselves in a
position to give me advice. In spite of
such impulses we thus refrained from
all public offence against the prevailing
fanaticism of the movement.
Hughes, indeed, complained on one
occasion of our hostile reticence. By
obstinately saying nothing, we were do-
ing the sacred cause as much harm as if
we were openly denouncing it. These
blasphemous silences, he hinted darkly,
Jack Murray ( Premier ) and Willie Watt.
would have to be put an end to in some
fashion.
He dealt with my position with more
than friendly candor. “It is not what he
says,” he said, “but what he makes you
believe he could say if he made a start.”
I refused either to be drawn or to
depart from my settled policy of con-
templation.
THE SAVINGS
BANK *
DISPUTE
Fisher ex-
ploded the
next bomb
under our
quiet do-
m © s ticities
by proposing to establish a
Federal Savings Bank. All the
States were moved to alarmed
and indignant protest.
That the Commonwealth
should start a bank of its own was fair
enough. But why a savings bank? Every
State Government had a savings bank
already, covering all the' ground ; and
these approached perfection in their
general management as nearly as is pos-
sible to any merely Governmental affair.
The Victorian Government at once
realised the results of the proposal—the
probable raising of interest on deposits
and the increased proportion of overhead
charges if the bulk of deposits dwindled
—and the consequent likely conversion
of the closely-balanced financing of the
Savings Bank Commissioners from a pay-
ing business, into a losing one.
The Premier, Murray, and the Trea-
surer, W. A. Watt, came over to Sydney
and conferred with McGowen, who in
our State combined both offices. He
called me in, and the four of us drafted
on the spot a letter of remonstrance to
Fisher to which the signatures of the
other State Premiers were obtained.
One of the issues of the Federal elec-
tions had been the establishment of a
Commonwealth Bank, which was in-
scribed on our Federal platform. But there
the bank was described in uncompromis-
ing print as an ordinary trading bank, one
for deposit and issue, and certainly no
word of a Commonwealth Savings Bank
had ever been mentioned in the Labo ( r
movement. I, among others, had spoken
at a score of meetings during the elec-
tion with Labor candidates, and the idea
was quite unheard of.
THIS joint protest of the whole of the
State Governments, representing
every part of Australia, came to nothing.
Fisher treated it with indifference. The
Senate, whose special function it is to
voice the claims of States, was equally
unmoved. The Labor Senators voted
like one man for the “labor” scheme,
although that scheme was not to be
found on the Labor platform and had
never been mentioned at the elections.
The bill became law, and the Federal
Savings Bank is to-day an established
fact over the whole of Australia, every-
where duplicating functions that were
already amply and admirably discharged,
everywhere multiplying functionaries and
increasing expenses.
This overlapping of State and Fed-
eral functions is to-day one of the
commonplaces of pessimistic comment
on Australia’s over-government. But it
should not be forgotten that when this,
the first and in many ways the most im-

miership hat).
portant of all its in-
stances, was sug-
gested the only
serious protest
raised was the one
I have described. It
got no effective
backing anywhere,
and, because the
new savings bank
thus erected at the
risk of ruining all
the old ones was
itself a financial
success, the whole
scheme became in
a year or two a
part of the accepted
order of things.
The Fisher Gov-
ernment had
learned another
valuable lesson as
to the entire un-
importance of stick-
ing to its plat-
form, and the doc-
'trine of the scrap
of paper was far-
ther advanced.
W. A. WATT:
AN ESTIMATE
The episode
had one personal
benefit to me. It
brought me for
the first time into fairly close touch
with the Victorian Ministers, especially
Watt. I had, of course, encountered
both him and Murray before this,’ but
never at such close quarters.
It helped to beat down in my mind a
certain antagonism to Victoria which had
long smouldered there, and it laid the
foundations of an admiration for Watt —
his courage as well as his capacity —
which has never altered.
I am far from pretending that the full
powers of the man were revealed to me
in these two or three short interviews, but
that he was a man quite out of the
ordinary I thereupon ticked off and laid
aside in my mind as something definitely
decided.
AWKWARD
MOMENTS
Our position was
by now distinctly
disconcerting. We
had nearly half
the country in opposition, and we had,
apparently, within the first three months
of our Ministerial life lost the sympathy
and support of our own side. A
before most of us had been among the
foremost exponents of Labor feeling.
To-day we were in hiding, afraid to
express our views, or expressing them
if at all by subterfuge and parables.
It was a bitter, but in some ways a
wholesome experience. It tended to
save me, for example, from any excess
of vainglory over my sudden accession
to the headship of the Government. To
be acting-leader of a party, and to live
in daily expectation of denunciation by
prominent members of that party as a
traitor, is a state of things which, how-
ever bewildering it may be, does help
to preserve one from undue com-
placency.
In order to achieve even bur limited
success at the 1910 election Flowers,
Nielson and I had had to fight for years
against the obsolete and muddle-headed
methods of organisation which were
popular with the older Labor officials.
We had to seize upon executive power,
and had dispossessed other men who
valued very highly the distinction which
their functions and influence within the
movement gave them.
We had not done this without leaving
many vendettas behind us. Many “good”
Labor men greatly regretted our vic-
tory, which appeared to justify the
scorn which we had cast on their
methods and the confidence we had
shown in our own. I hese good men
now fell in with one accord behind the
claims of the Fed-
eral Government as
a swift method of
bringing about re-
tribution.
No Government
ever stood to have
its prestige so en-
tirely and so speedily
destroyed and at
the hands of its offi-
cial supporters as did
ours. That we sur-
vived at all was due
partly to the remark-
ably energetic reac-
tion shown by our
team to every kind
of difficulty, but
chiefly to the funda-
mental honesty of the
movement of those
days, which still
Had not yet lost
All its original brightness.
But I certainly
prayed Heaven with
ardor during this
season for us to be
saved from our
“friends.”

vintage).

What is “Pyorrhea ”
that millions
dread it so?
It’s a pretty grim statement, but the truth is half the people who wear false
teeth must do so because they failed to guard against pyorrhea, which is
responsible for one-half of all adult teeth lost.
They cannot, however, be entirely blamed for their line-draw
sunken cheeks —those telltale marks of artificial teeth.
For pyorrhea, which comes to four people out of five past the aj
a sly, insidious disease. It may infect your gums early in 1
there for years before you become aware of its dangerous presence.
Do not wait for gums to bleed
The first warnings of pyorrhea are tenderness and bleeding of the gums. If
neglected, pyorrhea softens the gums, loosens the teeth in their very sockets,
until extraction is essential to preserve the health.
But do not wait for these warnings. Take care of good teeth
while you have them. See your dentist regularly—before trouble
develops. Visit him at least twice a year.
And in your home brush your teeth, massage your gums with
Forhan’s. This dentifrice is unique in that it contains the benefits
of an ethical preparation developed by Dr. R. Jr Forhan, which
thousands of dentists use in the treatment of pyorrhea.
Protect the teeth you have
Your own teeth are far better than anything you can get to replace them.
Perhaps you do not realise what a blessing they are, so long as they are firm
and your gums are in good health. But do not risk the unhappy experience
of losing them. There is no finer dentifrice than Forhan’s—no better
protection for gleaming teeth and the mouth of youth. By all means, make
Forhan’s your dentifrice —you can make no better investment in the health
of your mouth and the safety of your teeth.
Obtainable from all Chemists and high-class Stores, or will be sent post-free upon receipt of the
price by the Australasian Agents—The Sheldon Drug Co., Ltd., 131-135 Clarence St., Sydney . N.S.IV-

ALL WAVE RECEIVERS
-19-6
The following are a few of the special
features responsible for the amazing per-
formance of the Stromberg-Carlson Dual-
Wave Receiver:
SELECTORLITE DIAL
This dial is divided into two distinct sec-
tions. The top part is used for tuning all
Australian (local and interstate) stations,
the call-sign of each station being shown
against its particular wave-length. The
lower portion is used when tuning on the
short-wave band. Short-wave and broad-
cast sections are lighted automatically and
independently, so that only that part
actually in use is illuminated.
Only one knob is used in tuning, and is
double-geared so that the dial • can be
swung quickly or very slowly as required.
VISUAL TUNING
Tuning without guessing or experimenting.
Just turn to the wave-length required, and
when the visual tuning needle shows the
greatest swing you know you are on your
station. You then simply turn up the
volume to the strength you wish.
AUTOMATIC VOLUME CONTROL
Detects changes in volume from the
broadcasting station before they are
apparent to you and immediately read-
justs power so that the reproduced volume
is unchanged.
Visit your Stromberg-Carlson Dealer to-
day. Ask him to explain fully the features
briefly described above. Hear the faultless
reception of Local, Interstate and Foreign
programmes. There’s a surprise for you
when you do. Give yourself that surprise
to-day.
