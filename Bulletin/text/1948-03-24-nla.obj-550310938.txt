NOW A SPLENDID HOSTELRY IS STATELY TAYMOUTH CASTLE
by some of the loveliest scenes in Scotland,
Taymouth Castle stands near the northern end of Loch Tay,
in Perthshire. Built lBOl .and 1842 on the site of an
ancient stronghold, Taymouth Castle was the seat of the marquesses
and earls of Breadalbane, a Scottish title borne since 1681 by a
branch of the Campbell family, but which expired in 1922. In
1921 Taymouth Castle had been sold by the last earl of Breadal-
bane and has since become a great hostelry, noted especially for
the magnificence of itsi interior. Nestling at the very gates of the
castle is the neat little village of Kenmore, often quoted as Scot-
land’s model village. Here at the Kenmore Hotel Robert Burns
left some verses inscribed over a mantelpiece. Not far from
Kenmore is the small town of Aberfeldy, from which it is but a
short journey to the famous) Falls of Moness, where Burns wrote
“The Birks o’ Aberfeldy.” In this district, too, is the almost
incredibly ancient towni of Fortingall, where they tell of a. Strange
legend. It is this: that a century before Agricola there came from
Rome an embassy to Fortingall. Here the embassy made a stay
and one of the ambassadors became father of a son. The boy
grew up and his name was one of the most unhappily famous in
the world’s history—Pontius Pilate.

CAVE AND JUNGLE.
Stating in the foreword to My Caves
(Dent) his apology for falling down pot-
holes, crawling on his stomach through
caverns and trying to drown himself in
underground rivers, Norbert Casteret
quotes Shelley: “The happiness of the
soul is in action.”
Casteret, as anybody who read his
Ten Years Under the Earth will readily
admit, has every right to credit himself
with a soul. His expression of the soul’s
happiness takes a peculiar form, and for
some reason or other it is difficult not
to regard the exploration of caves, which
subjects the author to much peril and
rewards him with much beauty, as faintly
comical; yet, oddity notwithstanding,
Casteret is a man nf action in almost the
grand manner: reminding one, for his
rare quality of mind, his blending of the
scientific spirit with adventure and with
poetry, of two other distinguished French-
men, Sainte-Exupery and the naturalist
Fabre. He is at once a mole and a
mystic: “The wanderer in these places
below the surface has joys beside those
of action, the calm complete silence, the
solitude in superb surroundings which
conduce to quiet thought and the uplift-
ing of the mind.”
To turn from his book to another and
almost equally interesting volume of ex-
ploration and autobiography, James Rid-
dell’s In the Forests of the Night (Hale),
is to leave the soul behind. Or so, on
the surface, it appears. Riddell, who
spent the years just before the outbreak
of the second World War —when Casteret
was burrowing in the caverns of the
Pyrenees—taking photographs of wild
animals in the Belgian Congo, is anything
but a soulful traveller. He is a very
jaunty one, addicted to light humor and
puns. Whereas Casteret, even in trans-
lation, is obviously a stylist,. Riddell is
slangy.
One is, consequently, tempted to agree
with Riddell that his book should have
been written by his companion Kenneth
Gandar Dower —whom he calls, of course,
“Gander” —but still he is a disarming
fellow. Every night in the jungle he
talks in his sleep, being madly pursued
by the animals he has pursued in his
waking moments, and “Gander” in the
morning tells him what he has said, and
Riddell faithfully records it as a joke
against himself. He confesses, amiably,
that he cannot keep flippancy out of Ijis
writing and, at the end, he imagines
“Gander’s” verdict on his book:
“Not brad, Jimmy. Not good—but not
bad. A little inaccurate in places, perhaps,
but then it all happened a long time ago.
But I do hate all those dots you will
insist on using”
Which certainly disarms a criticism of
his dots, villainous though they are. And
Riddell has more in common with Cas-
, teret than his flippancy will allow him to
mention. It is, presumably, quite as
dangerous to face, armed only with a
camera, a charging forest hog— not to
mention a charging gorilla—as if is to
climb an underground waterfall in pitch
blackness ; and to sit up all night in a
tree watching elephants and flying-foxes
is, even if one is afflicted with a sense of
humor, essentially quite as poetic as to
lie as Casteret does night after night in
a cave studying the behavior of bats and
thinking about prehistoric man. If there
is no magic in Riddell’s style, his place-
names sometimes provide him with it
willy-nilly; “Next to Nyamlagira stands
Ninagonga.”
So Riddell, though he thinks at one
stage of setting his cameras, trip-wires
and flashlights in a hotel corridor to
record the nocturnal activities of the in-
habitants, may be regarded after all as a
worthy companion for Casteret, a man of
action and an adventurer of the soul.
His photographs, indeed, are as full
of beauty as Casteret’s prose ; or at least,
if a close-up of the giant forest hog can
hardly be termed beautiful, they convey
the same sense of strange and primitive
life. Riddell set out to photograph
animals behaving naturally in their
natural surroundings, so everything was
done by trip-wire and flashlight in the
jungle: resulting, when his camera be-
came infected with his own flippancy,
in remarkable representations of an ele-
phant’s foot and the back end pf a hippo-
potamus, but also providing fine views of
leopards, hogs, whole elephants, a flying-
fox and improbable animals named the
bongo and the hydrax.
The gorillas which were his prime
objective eluded the camera, but he met
them more than once and, in defiance of
other authorities, met them sitting in
trees. His other acquaintances • included
pigmies, giants, ferocious Belgian officials,
fish that had been served up cooked
when a volcano poured lava into a lake
and, in his sleep, a tiger which was quite
safe “because it was on a string.”
It may be said for Riddell, slightly
punch-drunk though his typewriter must
have been after he had finished slamming
at it, that In the Forests of the Night
shows him at his best. It is flippant, it
is light, it is a fair record of an adventur-
ous expedition and it is not bad fun.
My Caves, it must be said with regret,
is not Casteret at his best. It is doubt-
ful if, after Ten Years Under the Earth,
he can ever be quite at his best again.
He is one of those lucky and unlucky
litefary amateurs who have produced an
autobiographical masterpiece.
Ten Years Under the Earth, like The
Story of San Michele and Walter Starkie’s
Raggle Toggle, was the sort of book a
man can produce only once in a lifetime
—for the reason that it was, literally, the
book of his lifetime. Any attempt to
carry on such a narrative into a second
volume, such as My Caves, must almost
inevitably be repetitive or a thinning, a
watering-down of the original statement.
My Caves is both thin and repetitive.
Casteret, it is true, paints the world of
his caves and pot-holes vividly, with
drama and imagination:
We had to burrow in thick, sticky clay
which blocked our way and transformed
us into huge lumps of mud. Hammer and
chisel disappeared in a matrix of clay,
while oui; hands resembled boxing-gloves
with a webbing of clay between all the
fingers. We became indistinguishable from
this horrible slime; siderolithic clay, the
geologists call it.
As we were emerging from this last ob-
stacle our ears were struck by a dull
rumbling which increased in intensity and
then rapidly died down.... Our astonish-
ment and our fears soon vanished when we
realised that the phenomenon was merely a
train Creeping about like a caterpillar
in the realms of silence and of darkness I
picture the train rolling rapidly along
through a countryside bathed in sunshine.
We found ourselves wandering in a
vast gallery leading to the grandest cascade
of stalagmitic rock we had ever seen under-
ground.
It is a fascinating world, fascinatingly de-
scribed : but Casteret has done it before.
The book lacks continuity, and chapters
on the history of cave-exploration, on
the celebrated caves of America and on
the .equipment Casteret uses for climbing,''
wriggling, swimming and floundering
below the earth look suspiciously * like
padding.
But when that is understood, My Caves
is still extremely attractive, and readers
who missed the earlier volume will prob-
ably find it a delight. Some of its most
interesting chapters deal with the explora-
tion of the enormous chasms called pot-
holes, an adventure for which Casteret
had the company of the Belgians Max
Cosyns and Vander Elst who had previ-
ously distinguished themselves by ascend-
ing into the stratosphere. The Belgians
had invented a device of a windlass,
bracket and steel cable for sailing almost
as far down into the earth as they had
previously soared above it, and Casteret, as
a gesture of courtesy, was allowed pride
of place in the descent:
The expression “hanging by a thread”
had never appeared to me more appropri-
ate and more unpleasing than when, with
the ring at the end of the wire rope linked
into the clasp-ring of my harness, I deliber-
ately took the step forward which left me
hanging in mid-air, while the metal wind-
lass looked to me deplorably frail and pli-
able as it bent and creaked under the
strain As my eyes came level with the
rim of the pot-hole the vision of this
peaceful bit of forest was suddenly re-
placed by the familiar but always impres-
sive sight of a gaping chasm with damp
glistening walls hung with hart’s-tongue and
soft wads of moss, with knobs of rock
protruding over the abyss like gargoyles
Below the overhang the hole widens out
considerably and I went down out of reach
of the walls, dropping in space. Nor was
it long before I began to be conscious ■ of
the drawbacks of my position, for a gyra-
tory movement began which soon developed
into a wider and faster swing. In the
almost complete darkness the feeble beam
of my torch could only catch a few details
of the cyclopean walls, and before long
the movement became so violent that my
eyes failed to register any impression at all.
I was conscious of a horrible feeling akin to
seasickness.
As a reward for thus spinning seasick
into the abyss, Casteret eventually reaches
the bottom, where no man has previously
trod, and finds the skulls of three dead
sheep—a perfectly satisfying result to the
intrepid and mystical tribe of pot-holers.
Although on that occasion he experi-
enced no worse dangers than a bombard-
ment of stones from above, Casteret was
to learn on another occasion that he was
not unwise in fearing the windlass and the
wire rope, for, exploring at dead of night
the pot-hole of Heyle, the second deepest
in France, he swung in mid-air for half
an hour when the apparatus was out of
order, and it took 50 minutes to haul his
companion to the surface —“I was
horribly anxious for my companion as
he swung about in space at increasing
heights, where the breaking of the cable
must have been fatal; or, if not that, he
might have been suspended without any
possibility of rescue by the definite break-
down of the winding apparatus.”
Except for some imaginative recreations
of their lives Casteret has not so much to
say about the cave-dwellers of antiquity
in this book as he had in Ten Years
Under the Earth : he makes no new dis-
coveries of carvings or relics. For the
most part he is crawling from one great
limestone cavern to another, describing
the wonders of stalagmite and stalactite,
or he is paddling his rubber boat along
the subterranean rivers.
As a compensation for the absence of
cave-men, he has a nightmarish descrip-
tion, quoted from Professor Jeannel, of
an “ocean” of cockroaches plunging and
heaving in the bat-guano in the caves of
Shimoni in East Africa and, from his own
observation, a great deal of information
about his friends the bats. He discovers
that, before going on its evening flight, a
bat must glaze and waterproof its wings
with oil from a gland at the end of its
nose; that bats have a strong homing
sense and, taken as far as 165 miles from
their cave, would fly straight back to it;
that apparently they have other mys j
terious senses which, in the darkness of
the deep caves, tell them-when night has
come and whether or not it is a fine night
for flying. He says that the bat’s heart,
during hibernation, beats only two or
three times in a minute and that bats
join with swallows, swifts, nightingales
and cuckoos in Europe’s great seasonal
migration—a seemingly pointless journey
on the bats’ part, since they do not go
to follow the sun but to sleep in a cave.
Since it contains all this nature-lore,
My Caves, if it is likely to be disappoint-
ing to lovers of Ten Years Under the
Earth, may certainly be recommended to
all admirers of the bat. As for In the
Forests of the Night, that is also a little
bit bats.
Mainly Murder .
Dealing chiefly with the amiable and
popular subject of murder, A. E.
Bowker’s Behind the Bar (Staples Press,
Ltd.) should be assured of a wide audi-
ence : the more so since the murders are
genuine, and since Mr. Bowker, having
been clerk to Marshall Hall and Norman
Birkett, knows the backstage stories be-
hind some memorable dramas.
Even if one’s appetite for the Crippen
case, for instance, has been pretty well
satisfied by a score of previous benefac-
tors, it is pleasing to learn why Marshall
Hall refused the brief.- It was not, of
course, that he thought Crippen not a nice
man, or that the little man, having
poisoned his wife, should hang without
being defended: the difficulty was, says
Mr. Bowker, the fee. Crippen’s solici-
tor, offering to brief Marshall Hall, said
that the fee could not be paid until some
time after the trial was over. Mr.
Bowker, as clerk, had the handling of all
distasteful —or tasteful —money matters,
but in this instance he felt he should con-
sult Marshall Hall:
“Well, sir,” I said, “I am pretty certain
that Newton is banking on selling Crippen’s
own story to raise the necessary money to
cover his own and counsel’s fees, and he
cannot enter into negotiations, or at any
rate complete them, until the trial is over
and Crippen is either condemned to death
or a free man. It may be that in the event
of his being sentenced to death Newton
will obtain some sort of confession which
could be sold to one of the more sensational
newspapers.”
Marshall Hall, says Mr. Bowker,
turned the brief down on the grounds
that it was “too speculative.” The sequel
was:
After Crippen’s appeal had been dis-
missed, and after he had paid the penalty
on the scaffold, there appeared in a daily
newspaper what purported to be a “con-
fession” by Crippen. This document created
a tremendous sensation. Prison governors,
warders and chaplains all denied that
Crippen had confessed and Newton appeared
before the Law Society, where he main-
tained that the confession was genuine.
He was admonished for unprofessional con-
duct.
Though he gives several instances
where both Marshall Hall and Birkett
defended clients without payment, and
though he says Marshall Hall was sel-
dom involved in the most expensive kind
of cases, Mr. Bowker is—to a mere lay-
man —a little alarming on the subject of
fees: telling, as a kind of joke against
himself, how an offer of 250 guineas was
made to him by someohe anxious to
secure Norman Birkett’s services, how he
insisted “We should want at least a
thousand guineas and refreshers of 250
guineas a day,” and how, when that
proposition was eventually accepted, he
learned that the client would have gone
to 2000 guineas to get Birkett.
Mr. Bowker tells, with the same kind
of grim humor, how a young barrister
was called before his Benchers to explain
his taking a fee of 13s. 6d. when the mini-
mum permissible was £1 3s. 6d., and how
the young man pleaded not guilty, adding
“And in my view, far from having com-
mitted any offence lowering to the dig-
nity of my profession, I have carried out
the highest traditions of the Bar in tak-
ing every penny my client possessed.”
The biggest “plum” ever offered to
Marshall Hall, says Mr. Bowker, was a
fee of 25,000 guineas, with expenses for
counsel and his clerk, to go to India to
defend a Maharajah on a charge of kid-
napping a dancing-girl. The Maharajah,
alas, decided to abdicate within 48 hours
of the acceptance of the brief, and all
that remained with Marshall Hall and
Mr. Bowker was their retaining fee.
But it would be a pity to restrict a re-
view of Behind the Bar to the sordid sub-
ject of fees when Mr. Bowker deals with
such inspiring subjects as the Brides in
the Bath case (Marshall Hall impressing
the jury by a brilliant demonstration with
a bath-tub); the Camden Park murder
(Marshall Hall, securing ah acquittal,
telling the jury they “couldn’t hang a
cat” on the evidence); the bizarre case
of Lock Ah Tam, who killed his wife
and daughter after a party and who,
despite Marshall Hall’s public and private
belief in his insanity, was hanged; the
trial of Horatio Bottomley, of whom Mr.
Bowker gives a lively description; the
case of the brewer named Lawrence who,
after Marshall Hall had given one of his
favorite demonstrations with a revolver,
was acquitted of murdering his mistress
and who, within a few days of his ac-
quittal, was fined for assault; and the
motoring case, in which Norman Birkett
appeared, when no verdict could be
reached because one of the jurymen was
an atheist and a Trotskyite and didn’t
believe in ever convicting anyone of any-
thing.
Mr. Bowker, though an unpractised
writer, builds up a fine portrait of his
two great counsel, especially of the dra-
matic Marshall Hall; he is always in-
teresting on their cases; and he brings
very pleasantly to life, too, his “fifty
happy years” in the Temple. He says,
incidentally, that in his whole career he
knew only one cage in which he be-
lieved there had been a wrong convic-
tion.
Verses From the Navy,
It was noticeable during the war while
soldier verses were coming in a flood
that the Navy remained, on the whole,
the silent service. Noel H. Matthews’s
Challenge { A, H. &A. W. Reed, Ltd.,
N.Z.) does something to fill the gap, and,
had it been published two or three years
ago, might have “caught on” and sold
widely,
Matthews served with the R.N. from
1940 to 1945, and has since settled in
New Zealand. His verses are in some
respects typically those of a war writer,
unsophisticated and, in such minor mat-
ters as the use of inversions and the spel-
ling of “every” as “ev’ry,” rather old-
fashioned —the work of an unpractised
craftsman moved by the tremendous
events of warfare. The frequent use of
poetic cliches —“Life’s hard and dusty
street” —and some borrowings from
Rupert Brooke are other signs of literary
inexperience.
But the verses, frequently on themes
of landscape, are not tied down in the
war period, and, in the midst of the art-
lessness, Matthews shows an alert and
original observation —when, for instance,
a dying Indian child addressed as “0
little brown and human fly,” or in the
ant that,becomes a symbol of the decay
of Corsica and the timeless life of the
earth:
an ant on patient feet
Plods with a twig across the sleepy street.
Simplicity, when it is not smothered in
the false simplicity of an outworn and
derivative style, is a virtue that needs no
apology. It is the secret of W. H.
Davies’s strength. And sometimes, merely
by writing sincerely, with deep emotion
and a natural inclination towards poetry’,
Matthews is genuinely effective. His best
complete poem is “The Wanderers,”
romantic and probably youthful—
Sad was the song of their thin, drowned voices.
And they caught at my hair with spume-filled
hands;
Then they turned with the tide, those tireless
horses
And fled with their dead from the silvered
sands—
but a more enduring poetic power shows
in lines and flashes in the realistic
verses: the descriptions of rough land-
scape in “The Hills of Algerie,” the por-
trait of the dead soldier in “Would
Silence Fall,” the heartfelt emotion of
the last line of the poem on the dying
Indian boy:
A dreadful shadow stands across the day.
Challenge is the work of a war poet
who may continue to write. Matthews
should read more of the poetry of his
own century and remember Yeats’s
dictum: “Use the natural words in their
natural order.”

Particulars about cause and cure
of gastritis?
Inflammation of the lining mem-
brane of the stomach, commonly
known as gastritis, may occur in
either acute or chronic form. The
former may be due to food that dis-
agrees, whereas the latter slowly de-
velops as the result of some long-
standing irritation or congestion.
Acute gastritis also follows upon in-
fective fevers, scarlet fever and the
like, the trouble being then caused
by faulty digestion of food. Symp-
toms usually consist first of a sense
of overfulness or distension after
meals—later some pain may be felt
in the upper part of the abdomen
or in the back between the shoulder-
blades. This is relieved by flatulence
or wind from the stomach; hence
the value of peppermint antacids.
By way of treatment all errors of
diet must be corrected —foods must
be simple and easily digested, well
masticated and taken at regular inter-
vals. A doctor prescribes according
to the initial cause.

ROCO'S TREASURE
By GEOFF BINGHAM
r— \ OCO dreams too much. You
IV might say there is little dreaming
\ in digging the sharpened point of
) a broken spade-handle, stabbing
it into the earth, and, in the very hole
made, dropping a tomato plant; but Roco
dreams as he does it.
His hair, which is black, as though
sweat continually seeps through it, droops
and hangs over his white forehead. For
all the world —the wind coming down
from the Blue Mountains, and the sun
that hits the soil and glows into his face
—you would think the skin would be
browned long ago, but Roco’s skin ‘is
as white as the lily madonnas of his old
Italy. Old Italy, all right, but young
Roco.
He likes, almost best of all, to see the
postmaster at the Park post-office. That
man is a great oaf, he'thinks, but not
all an oaf. Often he has a talk with the
postmaster, and likes to taunt him with
his tales of vegetable-growing, and after
the vegetable-growing with his tales of
women, and most of all there is his
description of wine as she is grown in
Italy, and not only is there wine in Italy,
but olives also.
“Tomatoes you have?” he asks Mr.
Spiermont.
“No tomatoes', Roco,” says Mr. Spier-
mont. “It is too early for them.”
Mr, Spiermont is a huge man with a
laugh that is hearty. He roars to the very
heavens when he laughs.
ROCO could sneer. “Ha!” he cannot
help saying with glee, and he finds it
difficult to restrain himself from immedi-
ately launching into a description of his
tomatoes. Mr. Spiermont, as he knows,
loves to provoke him into these explosive
bursts, and then, when he is tied up with
the difficult and lazy Australian words,
Mr. Spiermont will laugh that huge
laugh and Roco will find himself laugh-
ing so that all the fun goes out of de-
scribing the tomatoes.
“Now tomato,” says Roco, and he
tries to look severe. “She are like this.”
His palms curve outwards, so that the
tomato is large, and the fingers caress
the air so that the tomato is smooth,
and Roco makes a red pout with his
mouth so that the tomato is soft, and
wiggles his tongue between his lips so
that the tomato she is very edible. Mr.
Spiermont understands perfectly.
“I don’t believe you have tomatoes,
Roco,” he says, and Roco fairly dances
with rage.
“No tomato? No tomato?” Roco
screams, and there are tears in his eyes.
“I have the ver-r-y beautiful, the tomato.
I bring her.”
He dances with more rage because he
sees the smile in the postmaster’s eyes.
The postmaster has nearly won.
“All-a right,” he says, “I bring you a
pound. Fifteen pound!”
The postmaster stops smiling. He
doesn’t want fifteen pounds of Roco’s
tomatoes, even if he does want some,
but Roco reckons it is worth fifteen
pounds to stop that smile.
“Rhubarb,” he says, although he hates
rhubarb himself, “What you say, two
feet, eh?” He extends his hands.
Mr, Spiermont does not laugh this
time. He does not like rhubarb, either.
All the Eyeties give rhubarb, and he
doesn’t want any from Roco.
“Cucumbers?” suggests Mr. Spiermont.
“Cold cucumbers?” If there is anything
Mr. Spiermont likes it is cold cucumber,
sweated and frosted slightly from being
in the refrigerator.
Roco then thinks, as he plunges the
sharpened spade-handle again, and drops
a seedling into the hole, that Mr. Spier-
mont might do anything for him, now
that he would be having fifteen pounds
of tomatoes, £nd a half-bushel case of
long, green cucumbers. Mrs. Spiermont,
he thinks, will also like the tomatoes
and the cucumbers, and he wonders, with
black roguery in his eyes, what it would
be like to tickle her, as he tickles the
girls in the caf6s and the little restaurants
in Bourke-street. Mr. Spiermont knows
all about this tickling of the girls, and
Roco thinks, perhaps that is why he has
never been invited inside the postmaster’s
house.
THE only thing Roco does not believe
in is trouble, and he does not think
that there is much to worry about in
the pot-bellied Australian picking his way
among cucumber-mounds, and tomato
rows, and ducking beneath the spray-
lines, and coming, eventually, to Roco.
Roco says to him, “Good-a day.”
This man looks like from the Govern-
ment. He has that stern Government
look, a bit foolish, at the same time
omniscient.
He says, “ ’Day,” very briefly, and
stares at the ground so that Roco thinks
there might be something wrong with
it, and he stares up at the sky as though
there has been some miscalculation there,
too, and then he looks at Roco. Roco
wishes Mr. Spiermont were here to talk
to him. Mr. Spiermont has an ease with
all men which is greatly the envy of the
Italian.
“This is your land?” asks the Govern-
ment man, Roco knows it is a Govern-
ment man,
“All-a mine,” says Roco timidly. He
would very much like to send out a
sweeping hand to encircle the entire six
acres, but the Government man would
not understand all that agony of joy
which Roco continually possesses. In
fact, Roco allows his black eyes to go
dreamily over nearly every inch of it
before he returns, timid once more, to
speak to the Government man.
“I buy her,” he explains.
The Government man nods as though
he doubts this, and as though, anyway,
this Italian must have got it by some piece
of trickery. He then wishes to know
how many men Roco employs. This
makes Roco want to smile. Heavens,
one man could work this, surely. He
thinks the Government man might not
know this, and would resent the laugh-
ing suggestion, so he says quietly that no
men are employed. The Government
man’s eyes open wide at that, but he
seems satisfied with the answer, and nods
ponderously.
“No employees,” he says and makes a
note in the small book with the black
cover.
Then he wants Roco’s name, his whole
name. Where was he born?, How long
ago? How long in Australia? He asks
some other questions. Then he seems to
relax and he asks Roco if he likes his
farm.
Roco likes it, all right. He says eagerly
that he thinks it is the best farm in the
Park. Far from pleasing the fat man
it makes him stern again.
“How,” he asks, “do you know your
farm is the best?”
Roco’s eyes become troubled. In one
voice he wants to shout to the foolish
man to go, to pick his way again through
the seedlings and the water-pipes, and to
leave him, Roco, alone, so that he can
dream among these green' bushes with
their red tomatoes, soft and ripening
and rich like the feel of the girls in
Bourke-street. Heavens, he has tickled
some of them, but his heart is not in the
thought as he answers the man.
“It is because I give her the manure,”
he says of his soil. “I give her the cow
manure, and the horse manure ...”
“And the fowl manure, and the pig
manure,” adds the man.
Roco’s eyes brighten. “You know,
eh?” he says, his eyes shining.
The Government man, who has been
heavily humorous, cannot take this honest
look from Roco, and turns away, staring
down the rows of tomatoes and lettuce
and cucumbers. Pity to take the land
from the fellow, but there you are, and
only a Dago in any case.
“We are going to resume your land,”
he says, staring down at it. “It is vitally
necessary.”
Much is incomprehensible, but what
little Roco understands of the Govern-
ment man’s conversation makes his heart
heavy, his dark eyes sorrowful and
frightened. He wishes Mr. Spiermont
were here,
“Resoomay?” he says. He shakes his
head, time and again. No, he can’t
understand that. But it sounds bad.
Before the Government man can say
much more he hustles him off the new
bed of tomatoes, away from the yellow-
blossomed cucumbers, and away from his
precious lettuce, and he hurries him to
Mr. Spiermont. Mr. Spiermont is busy
at the exchange, but when he sees Roco,
white-faced, then the fool of an official,
and the small black book, he hangs up
and ignores the buzzes and the flaps of
his instrument. He gives the pair his
attention.
< * D ESOOMAY! ” says Roco despair-
I \ ingly y his hands gesturing into the
air. Mr. Spiermont knows just about all.
He nods to the official “On resumption?”
he says, casually, as though it does not
matter at all, really. Roco could nearly
scream at this unfeeling attitude. He
thinks of the fifteen pounds of tomatoes,
the half-bushel of cucumbers, and he
thinks, in a black rage, that the post-
master will never see them. Nevertheless,
waiting despairingly, he hopes the post-
master might change.
“School,” says the official. “Resump-
tion for school. Make this place. Pity
in a way.” He is talking about Roco
now, that bit of trembling Italian flesh.
“Pity,” he repeats. “A nice garden, too.”

Worsley Enchanted
1.
(His voyage begins with a dream which, “be-
cause sailors are superstitious men,” sends him
to New Burlington-street, where he finds the
office of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedi-
tion, 1914.)
Commander Worsley, fired with a purpose
Plunged in his dream, like a stocky porpoise,
His blunt nose buffeted sheets of ice,
A snowstorm smothered the blue of his eyes,
His striped pyjamas shone like a rainbow
As morning glittered behind the window.
Commander Worsley supped his porridge:
“I have loved the sea, but that took courage,
To steer a ship through a sky of sleet
And a mad green sea in Burlington-street.
Dreams are dreams and waking, waking,
Yet still in my mind those waves are racing.”
Commander Worsley put on his clobber:
“Had no grog but I’m half-seas over.
There aren’t white icebergs in city streets
But pretty women and bowler hats,
I don’t want hats and I don’t want women,
I follow the wild white goose of an omen.”
Commander Worsley squared his shoulders.
Grinned at his boots like two black boulders:
“Whether it’s daylight, whether it’s dream,
Whether you sink me, whether you swim,
Whether you walked or were pushed or rolled
It’s you and me for the end of the world.”
I.'
(He travels into the country of his dream.)
If'
White, said Worsley, and glistening, the ridgy
plain
Of sea-water, frozen; being a known substance,
Though changed. As changes the frozen brain.
The sky, too, uncertain. At a little distance
A violet mist arises, fume of the frost,
Soon turned to gold to hide the killing of the
ship,
The water black in her hold when her timbers
burst,
Her body, black on the ice, raised twisting up
On the marching floes, then dropped and
trampled; crushed.
There were men and dogs on the ice, a litter of
gear,
But where, what place in the world, when the
dead sea flushed
With the glare of five suns in the sky, five
wheels of fire
Spinning in streams of crimson; where the
winter moon
In rushing silver swept the perpetual night.
And gentle as dream in wavering rose and green
In an abstract beauty, a kind of flowering of
light,
The aurora flowed its colors across the mind?
We longed very much to stand on solid lend.
True there were days of blue and rime in the
sun.
We laughed like men; and then above the
horizon,
Floating in light, a violet and creamy line,
The ice-pack swam in the heavens, wavy and
frozen,
And someone who stood, say, where we began
our drift,
At the point in the moving ice where the ship
wenf ■ down.
Would see us too with the golden bergs that
lift
And shift in the air in the blue Antarctic noon,
Stumbling in frozen color. I saw in that sky,
Huge, dark, Shackleton; the tall man striding
Through the lights that flash like mathematics
at play.
Through* mountains floating in air and icebergs
flying,
In a land beyond that wall of ice or glass
Through which men have seen at times glowing
shadows.
Is it the natural world through which we pass
Or the supernatural ? In the cold shallows and
hollows
I have seen the two as one, and gripped with
my hand
The wood of a boat, and longed for solid land.
3.
(He meditates on the nine Emperor penguins
which, on the day the Endurance was destroyed
by the pack-ice, appeared from a crack in the
ice and uttered wailing cries, such as “none of
us had ever before heard,” that sounded like a
dirge for the ship.)
Oh, there was broken wood,
There were weeds of iron and rope.
The log that was bigger than a tree
Crashed on the frozen sea
And the tall dark penguins stood
And stared at the ice without hope,
Said the nine Emperor penguins.
And these were a race of birds
Majestic, beyond belief;
There where the gold mist hung
They spoke in a foreign tongue.
Loud, sharp, excited words,
They rocked and shook with grief.
Said the nine Emperor penguins.
Bowing we stepped up close.
Our numbers making us brave.
But grinding like frozen thunder
Across the black seas under
Jagged reared up the floes
And crushed that ship in her grave.
Said the nine Emperor penguins.
Oh, it was strange, it was proud,
It was the worst of things.
In the mist and the darkening clouds
Something had happened to our gods
And we were alone and afraid
Who trod the ice like kings.
Said the nine Emperor penguins.
We knew what the blue sea hid.
Sea-leopard and killer-whale;
There was no day beneath
The sun but we thought of death
And shook off the shadow and slid
To the comber’s foam and its fall,
Said the nine Emperor penguins.
But now we have learned a truth
Not easy to shake from the feather
For we know what the blue sky hides.
Penguins that stride like gods,
And under the killer’s tooth
Lie gods and birds together.
Said the nine Emperor penguins.
Nobody knows where they went.
They came from the sky and are gone,
But we remember a ship
Crushed in the ice-floes’ grip.
The black thing broken and rent.
And we shudder with cold in the sun,
Said the nine Emperor penguins,
4.
(He watches the men on Elephant Island after
their six months’ drift on an ice-floe.)
But these men picked up pebbles
Wet from the sea and cold
And cradled them in their hands
As if they were coins of gold;
As if they had ended their troubles
On those lost frozen sands.
As if out of shells on the shore
Human voices would speak.
As if the crag was a house
And the kind wind would cook
On the thin and hungry fire
Gobbets of stone and ice.
Well might the seagulls screech
As reeling upon the sand
Like madmen and like devils
That starving, ragged band
Danced on the strip of beach
Their brief and scarecrow revels.
5.
(He hears Crean singing at the tiller of the
James Caird when with the singer, Shackleton
and three other men he is voyaging in the ship’s
boat to South Georgia to bring help to the men
on Elephant Island.)
“Nine hundred stormy miles”
The wet wind sang to Crean.
And Crean sang at the tiller
“The Wearin’ o’ the Green.”
“South Georgia’s far away
And Ireland’s further yet,
And black are the night and the sea
For a man to be singing at.”
6.
(He hears, as the sixteen days’ voyage pro-
gresses, the undersong of that “monotonous but
somehow cheerful” tune.)
It’s cold, says Crean at the tiller,
And dim in my mind I hear
The sound of a keel on shingle
And surf on a faraway beach
Where ice and pebbles mingle
And, thin for a moment, a cheer
Dying on crags out of reach.
Grey water, grey weather.
Sang Crean at the tiller.
The snowflake’s cold feather.
The hiss of the foam;
Four days of grey weather
For whale and for killer
And I have come home.
Oh grey-green abysses of water
Oh mountains that fall on the deck,
Deep in the trough of a comber
Then high, sang Crean, in the sky
Matting I saw and timber;
Somebody’s dead in a wreck.
Alive in the storm am I.
My friend the porpoise is coming
To roll and to plunge and to tunnel
Black where the blue seas are gleaming
Sang Crean in the sunny James Caira;
So hang up my socks till they’re steaming,
Roll off the ice in a runnel.
Wring out the salt from my beard.
Morning and evening falling,
Crean sang at the tiller,
And stories and men rolling
Gather no kindly moss
But the spray from the wind howling
As low on the long grey roller
Skims the great albatross.
Twelve days of endless combers
Roll, said Crean, in my song,
A weary voyage for roamers
Almost as tired as the dead
Fumbling in broken murmurs
For words that dry on the tongue
Or fade in the fog ahead.
Oh cool ice, sweet snow,
Oh spray that pretends to be rain.
Oh brooks that sing as you flow
Blot yourselves out of my thirst,
Sang Crean dogged and slow;
A man with a bearded grin
Licking his lips in the mist.
Crean sang in the storm
The loneliest song on earth
Of how the heart was warm
And yet a man might come
With his hand on the tiller firm
To his last setting-forth
Gaunt, frozen and dumb,
7.
(Worsley in the hurricane after sighting South
Georgia.)
Not the hunger, not the thirst.
All this world’s a world accursed;
Since the day we lost the Endurance
Nothing’s come but came like nonsense;
Black she lay with her frosty mast,
Here’s their dirtiest trick at last.
Not the storm, the devil take it,
I can bale it out in a bucket.
But on what fool’s errand bent
To cross the Antarctic continent
Came I here to the South at all 7
Not the shrieking knife of the gale
Slashing off the comber’s crest.
Not the land we found and lost,
But here the whole world stands on its head
Crazy alive and crazy dead.
Stand up straight or upside-down,
Die in your bed or swim and drown
But why and in what shadow play
Fights a man till break of day
Where the hurricane that raves
Where the midnight, where the waves
Are shadows of some vaster doom
Shaking the spirit, seen in dream?

WAR IN THE BALANCE.
Belgian Premier Spaak re-
cently made an acute comment
on the recurrent war-scares and
alarms: that if he had his way
all foreign-affairs news would
be published under small-type
headings. A man of humor, he
added that the maximum should
be two-inch type.
Despite the scares being as
sensationally presented in
America as here, a steady feeling
of optimism still runs through
the general outlook there, though
it is freely admitted that some
act of Soviet fanaticism, an
overstepping of the limits that
have been decided on, or some
other such cause might easily
set a war going. With the U.S.
one of the two major prospective
combatants, any optimism there
is at least a straw in the mael-
strom.
The hope outlook is based on
two main beliefs: (1) That,
while the U.S. is at its highest
peak ever in production (and is
thereby, with the atom bomb,
the strongest Power by far in
the world), Russia continues to
lag a long way behind and is
generally iq no condition to
launch a war; (2) for all the
outcry to the contrary in Soviet
propaganda (echoed by its Com.
fifth-column apes everywhere),
the Soviet leaders are well
aware that Russia is under no
threat of aggressive war against
it by the U.S. or any other
country.
As stated in the Budget pre-
sented by Mr. Truman to Con-
gress in January, America’s
output is at record levels;
actually 9 per cent, higher than
the wartime peak. The war
potential which that represents,
rather than America’s admittedly
much-whittled military strength,
is looked upon as a most potent
deterrent facing the Soviet
leaders.
Feeding the optimism from
the other quarter, “U.S, News-
World Report” gives “an
authoritative appraisal of
Russia’s industrial strength as it
now stands and as it is expected
to stand in 1960.” This ap-
praisal, it states, “rests upon in-
formation in the hands of the
U.S. and British Governments,
and is made for official use.”
According to that stock-tak-
ing, Russia’s present strength is
in its large population and a
geographical position which is
almost impregnable. But
“Russia is not strong enough in-
dustrially, at this time, to sup-
port an offensive war. Even by
1960—12 years from now—
Russia’s industrial strength is
likely to be only about two-
fifths that of the U.S.”:
In overall capacity Russia is about
45 years behind the U.S. By 1940,
just before her war with Germany,
her economic potential was equal to
that of the U.S. in 1902. By 1950,
at the end of the present five-year
plan, her potential is expected to
equal that of the U.S, in 1904. And
by 1960, if present trends are con-
tinued, she will achieve an economic
position about equal to that of the
U.S. in 1915.
In worker efficiency Russia in 1960
will be nowhere near the U.S. level
of 1915, however. Careful estimates,
made from available data, are that
her production per capita in 1960
will be about half that of the U.S.
in 1915.
In railroad mileage Russia is far
behind the U.S. By 1940 the total
mileage of her railroads was about
equal to that of the U.S. in 1872,
which was 57,323. Today the U.S.
has more than 226,000 miles of rail-
roads.
Poor transport always a
Russian weakness —is one of the
main reasons for the country’s
slower progress. A railroad
mileage of only one-fourth that
of the U.S. has to serve an area
about three times as large. The
report concludes:
Actually, say the U.S. and British
experts, it is a mistake to think of
Russia as a vast territory of untold
wealth and unlimited possibilities.
Most of the industries, farm land
and population of Russia are concen-
trated in a triangle that stretches from
Leningrad and the Ukraine on the
west to the new industrial areas of
central Siberia on the east. The
triangle is only a small fraction of
Russia’s huge area, but it is the
fraction that is the main source of
LOST.
N. Y. “Times.”
Russia’s economic potential. And
that potential is,held to be now too
weak to support the waging of an
offensive war.
As to the Soviet-propaganda
theme of a war-threat against
Russia, William Henry Cham-
berlin, an astute observer of
both Russia and America, has
pointed out:
The Soviet leaders are not con-
cerned with the possibility that
America might launch an aggressive
war against their country. Had they
taken this possibility seriously they
would have been far more accom-
modating in their attitude since the
end of the war. During the months
which preceded the German attack on
Russia in 1941, Stalin showed himself
willing to go very far in appeasing
Hitler. He fed the Nazi military
machine with exports of food and
raw materials; he humbly broke off
diplomatic relations with countries
which had been the objects of Ger-
man military attack.
This was because the Soviet Gov-
ernment knew that vast German
armies were poised within striking
distance of its frontier. No American
armies are in any such position to-
day. Wherever Soviet or Soviet
satellite armed forces are in close
proximity to American units today,
in Germany, in Austria, in Korea,
In Trieste, the Soviet numerical ad-
vantage is overwhelming.
The Soviet Union has preserved its
mass-conscription system while the
United States has not committed it-
self yet* to any form of universal
military training. Of course there
is a vast American industrial pro-
ductive military potential. And there
is the atomic bomb. But Stalin and
Molotov know that a republic like
the United States, unable to go to
war legally without Congressional
authorisation, would not and could
not strike the kind of sudden stealthy
blow which Hitler aimed at the
Soviet Union.
The fact of the Soviet position,
in Chamberlin’s appraisal, is
that “Russia today is more
secure against foreign attack
than at any time in its history.”
N. Y. “Times” correspondent
Drew Middleton denied re-
entry into Russia because,
while there, he was not con-
tent with merely parroting
official Soviet handouts —points
to one danger: that, as a result
of continued propaganda, the
Russian people “are beginning
to fear American aggression.”
But as for the Soviet leaders,
the very freedom with which
their representatives speak—
“hostile and sometimes insult-
ing to the United States” —is
probably caused by “their
knowledge that the United States
is not going to declare war.”
Two deciding factors, in
Middleton’s view, will be the
degree of success of the Russian
people in “achieving the internal
tasks their masters have set
them,” and whether “the disin-
tegration of the West” will pro-
ceed “at the tempo predicted by
the Kremlin.” Those holding
that an early war is. unlikely
reckon the Kremlin is backing a
loser in each of those events.
A staunch peace advocate,
David Lawrence, in N. Y.
“Sun,” expects Russia will be
having trouble with its satellites
and that this and its own eco-
nomic troubles “may bring the
long-expected internal dissension
that can weaken the Soviet
regime still further. This is why
a gesture- of friendliness from
Russia, secretly or otherwise, in
the hope of patching-up differ-
ences with America would not
be surprising”:
What makes a movement toward
an understanding possible is that
neither nation really wants war—
the Russians even less than America.
Any nation which has lost literally
millions of persons and still has
many more millions on the injured
list cannot look forward to war
with any enthusiasm. On the con-
trary, the prospect of a war can
produce internal trouble in Russia.
Against such optimistic views,
there is always the possibility
that the expansion wave the
Soviet leaders have been riding
may well be like a wave of the
sea, utterly unmanageable; that
they may be incapable of stop-
ping their momentum towards
war even if they wished to do
so. It was something like that
with Hitler.
At all events, Scripps-Howard
foreign editor William Philip
Simms reports that “American
and foreign intelligence agencies
[in Washington] are now receiv-
ing alarming reports concern-
ing Russia. She seems bent on
forcing the issue of peace or
war at an early date”:
Russia is known to have created a
sizable German army behind the
Iron Curtain. She also commands
large Rumanian, Bulgarian, Yugoslav
and Polish armies in addition to her
own huge war machine. She knows
that not a single European Power
could stop her if she started rolling
and that the United States has pretty
thoroughly demobilised.
The greatest peril, it is believed,
lies there. Hitler, it is widely agreed,
did not want war. He wanted to ex-
pand in a way that risked war but
which he thought would not happen.
Everybody, he figured, was afraid of
him. He guessed wrong.
Stalin is even more isolated from
the rest of the world than was Hitler.
Soviet envoys abroad live like her-
mits and are afraid to send in reports
which might fie displeasing to Mos-
cow. Like Hitler, Stalin might guess
wrong and make war inevitable.
In any event, the United States
and Western Europe are fighting
against time. For, no matter what
happens, Russia is certainly going to
go all out to nullify the European
Recovery Programme. Perhaps that
is why she is in such a frenzy.
The same observer sees) as
ominous the indications that
Soviet fifth-columns in France,
Italy, Greece, Belgium “and
other countries” are “getting
ready for trouble.”
Though a commission on
U.S. air policy, in reporting to
Mr. Truman, holds that a
major war is unlikely for about
another four years—“ And this
opinion,” its report says, “has
been expressed to the commis-
sion by high military authori-
ties” —the commission does not
overlook what is always a
danger: “There is, however,
such a thing as blundering into
a war.”
There is also the considerable
danger that the Russian leaders
might follow Hitler in being led
on by what they have acquired
so far to try for the lot. Austria
is mentioned as a specific limit-
mark ; a Soviet attempt to take
it over would mean war. The
Mediterranean, General Eisen-
hower recently pointed out, is a
potential trouble-spot; “Support
of nations whose independence
would assure free communica-
tion through that corridor is
essential.”
“Should the Mediterranean
not remain open,” Eisenhower
added, “war would be close to
us.”
Soviet Adulators.
Referring to the published
secret documents exposing Soviet
Russia’s criminal conniving with
Hitler to launch aggressive war,
N. Y. “Daily News” gives itself
a pat on the back with one hand
and heaves a brick with the other
at a target so large it’s impossible
to miss, either in the U.S. or
Australia;
Well, as our readers know, we are
not accustomed to patting ourselves
on the back. This time we can’t
resist making an exception to that
rule by recalling that throughout the
war we never kotowed to Stalin or
raved about “our noble Russian ally,”
as most of our esteemed contempor-
aries did. We were always sceptical
of Stalin’s good faith, said so now and
then, and were damned from hell to
breakfast for it. How does it feel
now, Russia-lovers of the war years,
to have your noses rubbed in this
proof of Stalin’s 100 per cent,
perfidy?
What the “Daily News” says
of itself could certainly be
claimed here by The Bulletin,
with the slight difference, per-
haps, that, while the “News”
wasn’t the only newspaper in
America sceptical of the Soviet
mythology, the sickly adulation
of the myth in Australia was,
apart from The Bulletin, as
good as unanimous.
It says something both on the
Soviet performance and the sheer
clumsiness and crudeness of its
“diplomacy” that all which that
adulation represented should
have been killed off so com-
pletely.
Bankruptcy Threatens
Britain.
The British Government’s
latest White Paper on the eco-
nomic crisis made evident
beyond any further question that
the threat of bankruptcy is fac-
ing sorely-tried J, Bull. What is
questioned, however, is whether
J.B. is yet really facing the
threat. In the forthright com-
ment of “U.S. News-World Re-
port,” “Britain’s effort to sit on
the lid of a very virulent infla-
tion is going to end some day in
a big explosion.”
As an instance in its conten-
tion that Britain is close to 1 “in-
ternational bankruptcy,” it
points to the deal with Argen-
tina ; Britain “swapping a rail-
way system, built and operated
with British* capital in Argentina
for food and feed —things that
will disappear in a year or so.”
It describes that deal as “an act
of desperation.” The “money
invested in Argentine railroads
by Britons over the last 60 years
totals about $1,000,000,000”;
the “sale-figure finally agreed
upon is around $600,000,000.”
The contention that Britain,
under its) present Government, is
even now not facing the bank-
ruptcy threat with anything like
the realism called for has been
strongly stated by London “Eco-
nomist.” Its comments in an
article on the previous economic
White Paper apply also to the
later Government statement and
could be a guide to develop-
ments ahead ; • a safeguard
against the sort of surprise occa-
sioned by the “dollar crisis,”
despite its having been long and
emphatically forecast.
In the past two years, the
“Economist” stated, the British
people had overspent their in-
come to the extent that, with the
present continued rate of ex-
penditure, the remaining reserves
in gold, dollars and unexhausted
credits may last Britain and the
sterling area until midsummer:
After that, it will just be impossible
to buy either the food or the raw
materials which are necessary for
Britain to eat and work. The spectre
of starvation and mass unemployment
is now alarmingly close
Britain has been living like an im-
provident family which, failing to
make both ends meet, first spends the
accumulated capital of the past, then
borrows from friends —from Ameri-
can friends, from Canadian friends,

from South African friends —and
when their loans are exhausted begins
to pawn the furniture. How else can
one describe the latest deal with
Argentina in which the whole capital
asset represented by the British-owned
railways is bartered away for 18-
months’ supply of meat? It is, of
course, true that there is nothing dis-
creditable in the events which led the
British community to this desperate
plight. Alone of the belligerents
(except the German aggressors) Britain
fought in two world wars from the
first day to the last. The income
from overseas investments which
nearly bridged the gap between im-
ports and exports in 1938 disappeared
in the struggle But the reasons
which have brought the British to
beggary are less likely to be remem-
bered than the fact that they are
beggars. The old soldier showing his
campaign medals at the street comers
is an object of pity, not of respect.
When a family faces bankruptcy
either it goes under to a life of per-
petual makeshift and pauperism or it
restores its solvency by vigorous
action —by buying less, by cutting
down every kind of expense and by
straining every nerve to sell more 9!’
its goods and services. A nation is in
no different case and the choice open
to the British people is in reality pre-
cisely the same difficult choice be-
tween pauperism and gruelling re-
covery. The only question worth
asking today when the crisis is, in
Sir Stafford Cripps’s words, not a
matter of years but of months and
weeks, is what further steps the
British people can take to consume
less and produce more, to reduce their
standard of living and at the same
time do harder work Clearly the
Government’s plea—-it is not much
more —that neither wages nor profits
rise at this juncture is one small part
of the much bigger effort that is
needed to restore solvency to the
British people.
Both wages and profits have to con-
tribute their share. Bankruptcy is a
family responsibility, and no section
of the community can avoid its hard-
ships. The real need for workers and
managers alike is longer hours and
more output for the same income.
In this way more goods could be pro-
duced for export without new
financial pressure being created to
divert those goods to consumption at
home. So drastic a departure from
current industrial practice is too much
to hope for, but at least the principle
of no further wage increases save for
cases where workers are genuinely
below an adequate level of subsistence
must be endorsed....
But the brute fact remains that
standards of consumption in Britain
do not reflect the insolvency which
may lie only a few months ahead.
The “Economist” argued that
cuts in domestic fuel, Govern-
ment overseas expenditure, the
forces, public servants, etc., are*
not yet drastic enough:
In spite of the recent cuts in capi-
tal expenditure, ‘it is clear that more
has to be done. No one will criticise
the Government for wishing to build
better schools, new hospitals and
more and better-equipped houses. But
this programme has added to Britain’s
insolvency by diverting materials and
manpower from the export industries;
in that sense it is Americans,
Canadians and South Africans who
have been paying for part of the
British programme of development at
home. No one denies the desirability
of these things, b,ut it is not usual to
add a bathroom to the house just as
the receivers walk in
These are a few instances picked
from a possible list of further cuts
and reductions, but simply to set them
down shows how painful their execu-
tion would, be and what appalling
stresses it would introduce into the
national life. But bankruptcy is
necessarily an ugly, painful and dis-
tressing business. It tests the temper
of the most united family. It re-
quires not only fortitude and patience
but considerable humility to weather
it with dignity and success. Yet
bankruptcy is nevertheless the crisis
through which this nation may be
about to pass. What are its chances
of surviving this latest test —a test
with none of the glory and solidarity
of a nation at war but perhaps more
gruelling as a result?
It cannot be said that the outlook
is encouraging. In the first place,
the country so far has remained in
ignorance of the facts. The Govern-
ment’s powers of explanation have
never been high, but its inability to
convey to the public the significance
of the gathering economic crisis is
beyond all previous failures. And
this is not simply a question of poor
public relations. The failure goes
deeper. It is not only that the Gov-
ernment has not talked as though
the crisis were serious. Until quite
recently it has not behaved as though
it were. In 1946, before the catas-
trophic rise in American prices and
the fierce winter, there was some ex-
cuse for believing that Britain could
recapture its export trade, police
Europe, rebuild its industries; create
new social services, rehouse the people
and provide cheap food all at the
same time. But the writing on the
wall was there for all to see after
January or February, 1947. The fatal
flux of gold and dollars had begun.
The gap between imports and exports
was growing. Home production con-
tinued to lag, but the Government
went on its Micawberish way, wait-
ing for something to turn up. Mr.
Dalton was happy with his “bal-
anced” Budget, Mr. Morrison declared
that no further sacrifices could be
demanded of the people. Today,
with the gap wide open and no pros-
pect of filling it from British re-
sources, even Sir Stafford Cripps’s
realism may be too late.
If the British had been made to
realise in 1945 that in many ways the
problems of reconstruction facing
them were no less urgent than that
which faced, say, Poland, they might
have set to and worked as the Poles
have done; but cradled in illusions,
they have advanced in their crisis like
sonnambulists. It is the illusion
either of infinite prosperity or of in-
finitely squeezable profits that makes
it still possible for the trade-unions
to press for more wages for fewer
hours. It is the illusion of wealth
withheld by a spiteful Government
that has turned large sections of the
more well-to-do against the controls
and restrictions which they recognised
as necessary during the war. Yet the
reality is of a nation in greater eco-
nomic straits than at any time since
the Napoleonic wars. If the present
attitude of the different classes in
society cannot be mobilised into some-
thing more than the collective and
disgruntled selfishness they show to-
day, then the British will be obliged
to face their supreme economic crisis
without the only assets upon which
they could still draw —their political
balance, their deep natural unity, their
phenomenal staying-power.
Declaring that “a standard of
living has been maintained, re-

serves have been eaten up, ex-
penditures undertaken on a scale
which is quite out of accord with
Britain’s real economic posi-
tion,” the “Economist” asked
what guarantee there was that
the Marshall Plan would not be
used the same way. “The only
proper, the only long-sighted,
the only courageous course,” it
concluded, “would be for Britain
to pursue now the policy it would
pursue if the Marshall Plan
were reduced to a half or a third
and to use the surplus thus
created to build up reserves,
modernise industry, develop eco-
nomic integration in Western
Europe and undertake now the
programme of hard living and
hard working in which in the
long run salvation alone will
lie.”
Cominform Dissension.
An interesting view on the
revival of the Comintern as (lie
Cominform has beert set out in
an “American Mercury” article
by Martin Ebon, author of the
recently-published World Com-
munism Today. The view is con-
tained in the article’s title,
“World Communism Has Passed
Its Peak.” Ebon, in fact, sees
the Cominform as a sign of
weakness and Communist dissen-
sion ;
Until the summer of 1945 world
Communism held all the aces. Rid-
ing high on a wave of Russian pres-
tige, it was in a position to win
millions of adherents in the demo-
cratic countries. Instead it launched
a diplomatic and propaganda war on
democracy. Communism went from
a policy of the outstretched hand to
a policy of the mailed fist.
It hasn’t worked out. And there
are Communists alert enough to see
and understand this. Communists
and their friends in the United States,
in Italy and in Latin America have
openly—although with understandable
timidity—expressed their doubts about
the current policy. The Communist
movement has been weakened by dis-
agreements between individual Com-
munist parties, particularly in Europe.
There are open cleavages inside a
number of Communist parties, not-
ably in Latin America.
It was disagreement between indi-
vidual Communist parties, as much
as anything else, which led to the
September conference of nine Euro-
pean parties in Poland, and to crea-
tion of the Belgrade “Information
Bureau.” Press reports and com-
ment on this matter have been ex-
ceedingly superficial. When it was
reported, on October 5, 1947, that
representatives of nine European
Communist parties (guided, of course,
by the Soviet Union) had agreed on
a bureau “for an exchange of experi-
ence and voluntary co-ordination of
actions of the various parties,” there
was a great deal of talk about a “re-
vival of the Communist Interna-
tional,” about a “new Comintern.”
But the press missed, or slurred
over, the most interesting feature of
the meeting. This was the admission
—in a formal statement issued by the
Communist leaders of the Soviet
Union, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Ru-
mania, Hungary, Poland, France,
Czechoslovakia and Italy—that there
had been serious disagreement be-
tween their parties. The nine-party
resolution specifically referred to the
danger of continued “disunity among
Communist parties” and stated that
“such division between Communist
parties is incorrect and harmful.”
The secretary-general of the Polish
Communist party, Wladyslav
Gomulka, had told the conference
that “closer co-ordination of activity
of Communist parties” had become
necessary. It was “on this question”
and “having in view the negative
phenomena produced by the absence
of contact between parties represented
at the conference” that the Belgrade
Bureau was formed.
Insisting that there has been
“serious trouble inside the Com-
munist camp,” that “every one
of the nine parties present at
the September [Cominform] con-
ference had quarrelled with at
least one of its foreign counter-
parts,” Ebon looks into some of
the intra-party disputes:
Tito’s vociferous demands for
Trieste have seriously hurt the Italian
Communist party, which was also de-
nounced by the French Communist
party for its stand on Trieste. The
Yugoslav Communist regime has
meanwhile had trouble with its Bul-
garian counterpart, largely because
Macedonian nationalists in the Yugo-
slav Communist movement have
shown that they would dearly love to
incorporate Bulgaria into Tito’s so-
called Macedonian People’s Republic.
Hungary’s Communists had two
good reasons for participation in the
September conference. First, their
leaders had come out openly
against the expulsion of the Hun-
garian minority from Czechoslovakia,
whose Government is headed by
Communist Premier Klement Gott-
wald. Second, nationalist elements,in
the Hungarian Communist movement
have been trying to recover Transyl-
vania from Rumania, which also has
a Communist-controlled regime. The
Czechoslovak Communists, too, have
been at odds with their foreign com-
rades. In addition to their squabble
with the Hungarians, they are trying
to ward off demands by the Polish
Communists, who wish to bolster their
prestige among nationalist countrymen
by annexing the coal-rich Teschen
region. It is the Polish Communist
party which has proved to be the
most ardently nationalist and most
nearly anti-Russian in all of Europe.
All these conflicts are on an intra-
party level. All of them affect a large
nationalist element among the Com-
munist rank and file. The Belgrade
“Cominform” had to be publicly in-
stituted, so that even the lowliest
party member or fellow-traveller in
each country would understand that
the interests of world Communism
and of the Soviet Uniojn are upper-
most.
But disunion among its indi-
vidual parties is, in Ebon’s view,
“only one facet of the troubles
which Communists have these
days.” The men who set the
party line, he contends, have
good reason to wonder whether
it was so terribly clever, after
all, to lay down a barrage against
“American imperialism,” The
effect of this Communist policy
in the U.S.A.’s Latin-American
backyard “has been to endanger
the party’s once-great organisa-
tion there.” And the Latin-
American trends “have been
paralleled by similar develop-
ments in Western Europe and
the Far East.”
Aguing from all the signs that
“Communism is losing ground
today,” the writer holds that the
only thing that could now reverse
this trend would be a world-wide
economic disaster.
Dragnet Digest.
Nice New Scapegoat. —lt’s quite a
change to read the current Zionist
advts. in the American press. They’re
still as brutally vicious towards John
Bull as inventive ingenuity can man-
age, but at least they’ve dug up a
new scapegoat. A recent example
opens up: “One Jew is killed in
Palestine each hour of President
Truman’s uncertainty!” It proceeds:
“The President of the United States
is still uncertain whether he should
implement his own proposals, declara-
tions and statements on Palestine. He
is still uncertain as to whether Jewish
blood tips the scales of Arab oil.
He is still uncertain and the price of
his uncertainty is exacted from life
itself, from the Jewish people of
Palestine and the Jews of the world
who have already sacrificed one-third
of their total population, exceeding
the combined casualties of the United
Nations.” Well, it will be an odd
twist if this sort of thing builds up
an anti-Truman Jewish vote by next
November. He did try hard for them.

Palestine “Achievement." Ivor
Thomas, M.P., in a London “Times”
letter on the wretched fiasco which
Dr. Evatt was pleased to call an

months have made it clear that on

played with fire: let us not now
throw fuel on the flames. The United
Nations will indeed lose prestige, but
it will lose less prestige from the
abandonment of its policy than from
its enforcement. Indeed, it is doubt-
ful if the United Nations will lose
any more prestige from abandonment
than it has already lost by its light-
hearted acceptance of so dangerous
a policy and the forms of persuasion
used to get sufficient delegations to
change their votes.”

Grim Tax Prospect. —Looking into
Britain’s serious financial position,
London “Times” finds that even a
modest surplus can be achieved by
the Government “only by levels of
taxation at which little or no private
saving can be expected,” and “the
tendency may well be for civil ex-
penditure to increase.” It adds:
“In other words, there is grave
.•danger of settling down permanently
to a level of national expenditure so
high that income-tax at 9s. and pur-
chase-tax up to 50 per cent, on many
articles which civilised communities
regard as necessary, with astronomical
rates of tax on minor luxuries, be-
come an accepted commonplace. At
the present level of expenditure, even
if no Budget surplus were aimed at,
a reduction of perhaps 10 per cent,
in Customs duties and purchase tax
and a reduction of perhaps Is. in
the £ in the rate of income-tax would
be the most that this generation could
ever look forward to even in a calm
and favorable year.”

Belgium’s King. —lt seems that what
they’d like in Belgium would be for
King Leopold to quietly turn the job
in, clearing the way for his son,
Prince Baudouin, who’ll be 18 in
September, and could then legally take
over. A “Christum Science Monitor”
correspondent reports that “all Bel-
gians, with very few exceptions, agree
that the monarchical system is well
adapted to their political needs and
is the best safeguard of national
unity.” Leopold is not held to have
betrayed his country to the Nazis,
but “he apparently believed the Ger-
mans would win the war, and he
tried to adapt Belgium to a future
German-dominated Europe.” In short,
his judgment wasn’t good enough for
his people to want him back.
* * * *
Motor-ships Preferred. Maybe
steamers are on their way to join, the
old sailing-ships. At any rate,
“Lloyd’s Register” states that of 837
vessels launched throughout the world
last year, 530 were motor-ships,
against 257 steamers, and the rest
non-propelled types.
* * * *
Pacifists of Sorts. —Referring to the
fashion, prevalent between the wars,
of holding armed strength to be itself
a principal cause of war, London
“Nineteenth Century and After”
editor F. S. Voigt comments: “To-
day the fashion still has its followers,
but the present state of the world
compels any Government with any
sense of responsibility to resist the
pressure they exercise, for the danger
of a Third World War is evident,
and it is equally evident that the
danger must increase if Great Britain
is weak and decrease if she is strong.”
Voigt declares that in trying to keep
Britain strong in defence Mr. Bevin
has to resist considerable pressure,
though from a different brand of
“pacifists”: “The pure pacifists are
feeble in numbers and in spirit. But
there are others who make a pretence
of pacifism and are strong in num-
bers and even stronger in determina-
tion. They fear that if war comes
Great Britain and the United States
will win. They want Russia to win.”
* * * *
Soviet Occupation Armies. As
viewed by former U.S. Secretary of
State James F. Byrnes in Speaking
Frankly: “Today the Soviets have
armies in Germany, Austria, Poland,
Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and
Manchuria. An occupation army is
an idle army and an idle army is
a bad army. The very purpose of
retaining soldiers in a foreign country
is to restrict the lives and liberties
of the people of that country. People
who want to be free resent the
presence of occupation troops and
they grow to hate the country that
keeps them there. They grow also
to hate, perhaps even more intensely,
the puppets who are kept in office
by a foreign army. As long as the
army is there the people are cowed
into submission. But when the Red
Army leaves, the legacy of hatred it
leaves behind will mean a difficult
and uncertain future for the puppets.”
* * * *
Government Owns the Wind. —Con-
tending that the vital issue for Britain
is “the restoration of the freedom of
the market,” G. L. Schwartz, writing
from London in “Wall-street Journal,”
refers to the case of the British shop-
keeper who was prohibited from using
a small windmill on his roof for gen-
erating electricity to light his shop
window, and comments: “Govern-
ment planning and control works
through faked prices, faked exchanges
and faked money and interest rates,
and the result is a faked economy
always verging on a crisis and only
kept going by police methods ranging
from the death-penalty to a ban on
the use of the free winds of Heaven.
The Government wants people to eco-
nomise on fuel-generated electricity,
and a man who gets costless electricity
may excite popular discontent. What
a world!” Britain’s old vaunted
freedom has lost something more than
only “freedom of the market.”

HORATIUS HANLON AT THE BRIDGE.
Mick Healyus (McCracken erst),
By his Red gods he lied:
“The bridge I’ll force, though a bleeding corse.”
“Come, friends!” Horatius cried.
Then out spake Spurius Chifleyus,
Who bleats from sea to sea:
“I will NOT stand at thy right hand
And keep the bridge with thee!”
And quoth McGirrnominius,
Pale at the gills was he:
“What, risk my nob in a Commo mob?
Not me, Ned H., not me!”
With drinking and with laughter
They still the story tell,
How Horatius Hanlon kept the bridge
When others ran like hell.

WILL IT BE WAR?
In the democratic world, sick as it is of
being robbed of peace by criminals mas-
querading as Communists, and of seeing
weak nations condemned to or threatened
with a cruel Oriental despotism, events
moved with a rush last week.
From many quarters, though not from
that in' which coldfooted “Labor”
politicians make a sorry pretence of
governing, came concerted resistance
to the monstrous pretensions of the
Kremlin and its nefarious instru-
ments, who speak many tongues but
are united in seeking the destruction of
government of the people, by the people,
for the people, together with warnings to
Stalin, the general significance of which
could not be mistaken: — 4
If you want war you can have it.
If you try to add to your ill-gotten
gains you shall get it.
Meanwhile, having arrived at a common
understanding, we will prepare for anything
that may befall.
At Washington on Sunday the Senate
approved of the Marshall Plan (styled the
European Recovery Bill) by a majority
which would have been impossible before
Czechoslovakia was joined to the string
of Communist States —over four to one.
That same day Chile, with influential
support, asked the U.N.O. Security
Council to “investigate charges that
Russia engineered the Communist coup in
Czechoslovakia” —charges lodged by Jan,
the Czechoslovak delegate, but refused a
hearing on the ground that he had been
repudiated by his “Government.” Before
the day was out the mortal remains of
Jan Masaryk (“the martyred Masaryk”
to Mr. Herbert Morrison) had been con-
signed to a grave adjoining his father’s,
church service, procession and burial be-
ing attended with demonstrations of
public grief and shame which bode ill
for the Communist gang guilty of his
death and its masters at Moscow.
Monday brought a statement from Mr.
Attlee that his Government had decided
to refuse employment “in work vital to
the security of the State” to any known
member of the Communist party and any
person “legitimately suspect.” Explaining
this decision, though in the circumstances
explanation was scarcely needed, the
P.M. said “we must deal very carefully
with the Communist party—l have not
forgotten its attitude in 1939, 1940 and
1941.” He added that dismissals would
be determined by an inquiry into the
associations and behavior of Communists
and fellow-travellers posted in “every
department where secrets must be safe-
guarded.”
There was a characteristic sequel;
Mr. Chifley was asked whether his Gov-
ernment intended taking similar action.
Always afraid of Communists —his elector-
ate is stiff with them, and its Macquarie
Assembly, in his presence, passed a pro-
Soviet resolution infamously insulting to
Britain in 1943 —he replied in his feebly
.evasive way that his “Government” had
“never had reason to believe that any
official engaged in handling documents or
other matters vital to security was other
than trustworthy. Words which Mr. Mac-
kenzie King might have uttered, had he
been a Chifley, when Gouzenko spilt the
beans; in which case that serviceable
Russian would have been turned away, with
his dreadful dossier, to be swiftly and effi-
ciently murdered. Fortunately the old
Canadian is poles apart from Mr. Chifley
in composition and practice.
Mr. Chifley’s “Government” found a
C.S.I.R. job for Mountjoy, whose brother
is a Communist and who himself was a
mouthpiece of Communist malignity in the
House, and another, as a research chemist,
for Rudkin. For Rudkin, who at Perth
in 1940, being then a Communist
editor, got a four-months sentence, to-
gether with a recommendation for intern-
ment throughout the war, for having pub-
lished information useful to the enemy and
the Comintern (1940 headquarters, Vienna),
and who, when he entered the dock with
his confederates, was introduced by prose-
cuting counsel with the words “There is
the Fifth-Column!” Afterwards the “Gov-
ernment” had to deal, in its fashion, with a
Communist threat —of boycott in the first
instance—to the rocket-range. The ugly
facts are all on record, and on record, too,
is the disgraceful story of Mr. Chifley’s
history of subservience to Communists at
every point of their wicked campaign against
Australia, which subservience, independently
of his latest affectation of incredulity and
indifference, stamps him as unfit for his post.
While Mr. Attlee was announcing his
plan for effecting a wholesale clearance
of potential Nunn Mays, Mr. Bevin was
presiding over a London gathering of
delegates from the 16 nations to receive
aid under the Marshall Plan. One of the
delegations came from Italy. To that un-
fortunate country Moscow had addressed
a peremptory demand for reparations,
waived by Britain, France and the
U.S.A., which indeed is reviving the
Italian mercantile marine with scores of
ships as a gift. Considering that Moscow
expects the Italians to go Communist at
the April elections it was an extraordinary
way of trying to “influence” them. But
then Communists are as clumsy as they
are vindictive, or it may be that the in-
ternal situation of the U.S.S.R. is so bad
that the boss Communists have to attempt
extortion even in the case of so poor a
prospect as Italy.
There followed on Wednesday, March
17, two mighty movements in the struggle
for the liberation of Christian Europe
from the atheistic barbarians who came
out of the steppes.
At Brussels there was signed by the
representatives of Britain, France,
Belgium, Luxemburg and Mr. Chifley’s
aversion the Netherlands a 50-year treaty
of “economic, cultural and social co-
operation” and military alliance, the latter
to take effect “if any party should be the
object of armed attack.” At Washington
the President asked a cheering Congress
for the “speedy” completion of the
Marshall Plan legislation, the “temporary”
re-enactment of the selective-service law
so that World War II Veterans might be
recalled to the colors, and the “prompt”
passing of a universal-training bill, all as
“most urgent steps toward securing peace
and preventing w'ar.”
Mr. Truman did not mince his words.
“I am here today,” he began, “to report
on the critical situation of Europe and
to recommend action.” Action to “sup-
port” in every way “those European
countries which are threatened with Com-
munist control and police-State rule.”
Along with the other democratic
nations his country had striven to secure
“a just and honorable peace.” They had
been thwarted by “one nation,”
which “persistently ignored and
violated” such agreements as had
been arrived at and which “obstructed
the work of U.N.O. by constant
abuse of the veto”—it has “vetoed
21 proposals for action in a little over
two years.” Worse still, “the Soviet Union
and its agents have destroyed the inde-
pendence and democratic character of a
whole series of nations in Eastern and
Central Europe,” ending with the Czecho-
slovakion republic, whose “tragic death
has sent a shock throughout the civilised
world” ; but not meaning to end there.
Greece, Italy and, “to the hazard of the
entire Scandinavian peninsula,” Finland
were under threat or attack.
It is this ruthless course of action and
clear design to extend it to the remaining
free nations of Europe that have brought
about this critical situation in Europe.
With the survival of freedom in those
nations the United States was deeply con-
cerned. Until they had regained their
strength, “and as long as Communism
threatens the very existence of demo-
cracy,” the United States “must remain
strong enough to support them.” And
time was the essence of the contract:
“it is of vital importance that we act
now."
So war may be only a matter of
weeks. The issue is in Stalin’s hands, and
Stalin’s hands, if faltering or palsied, as
is perhaps the case, may be forced by
some military adventurer, or by Tito
making a stab at Trieste, or by Italy
being brought into the Communist orbit
by force or fraud, or by the Greek army
being to Athens, for the port of
which a strong American fleet is making.
If war should come Australia will be in
it as a matter of course. In it with, ready
for service, one (1) cruiser, five destroyers
and five frigates ; with an “interim army”
of 19,000 officers and men still unorgan-
ised and without practice in the use of
whatever weapons there may be ; with the
Americans out of Manus, driven out by
the churlish shilly-shallying of Our
Foreign Policy ; with the Dutch still in
their islands but alienated by the same
Foreign Policy, in their case basely
handed over to Communists; and with
the great frontier State, of the first im-
portance as a base in the war against
Japan, blockaded by the Communists of
the Seamen’s Union and the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, whose allies in
Brisbane, headed by a ruffian called
Healy (he came to Australia as Mc-
Cracken) and setting law at defiance,
have been staging what had every appear-
ance of being dress-rehearsals for a rising
on the 1917 Leningrad model. In the
war with railway transport at the mercy
of fellows like Williams, Brown and Fer-
guson ; with a general Communist-caused
shortage of coal, cement, pig-iron, steel
and steel products and even electric power
for the simplest domestic operations, and,
above all, with Mr. Chifley as Prime
Minister and Mr. McGirr as Premier of
the State on which Australia would have
to depend for most of the materials of
war.
If war comes it could be faced without
trepidation only if public opinion asserted
itself, and if the unutterable Chifleys,
McGirrs and O’Sullivans had to make
way for men who have seen war at first
hand and could be trusted to gather up
all the Communists and put them where
they could do no further damage. Men
like Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Duggan in
Queensland, and Mr. Playford and Mr.
Cameron in South Australia, with Mr.
Hollway and Mr. McLarty remaining at
their posts and Mr. Sheehan in the place
which should know Mr. McGirr no more.
Palestine Bluff Called.
Ever since the end of the last war
Palestine has been a football of American
Presidential politics. It was so used
at the latest by Henry A. Wallace, help-
ing a Jewish anti-Truman candidate to
win a Bronx by-election. Those who
have most used it for such political pur-
poses in the past would probably now
like to see it shelved until after the Presi-
dential election in November. But events
are in too much of a hurry for them.
It -is one issue on which it would be
hypocrisy to profess much sympathy for
Uncle Sam. All due respect can be paid
to him on other counts: his colossal war
performance; his 1 generosity to the
threatened world then and since; the
high principles of freedom on which his
peace stand is based. But in regard to
Palestine Uncle Sam has himself been
mainly instrumental in bringing about the
mess he is now undoubtedly in. And that
he has done from no higher motives than
belong to the campaign tactics of party
politics.
The issue having been all through a
wholly false one from any American
national viewpoint—that is, no single
American national interest having been
served by supporting Zionist aims, but
rather the very contrary—the false
element of bluff has figured largely in the
game. It belongs to the category of bluff
that the only interest served has been the
party-political interest of winning the
Jewish vote in America for the most
blatant Presidential bidder. The pretence
was affecting to be moved by inter-
national altruism.
At a critical moment in Britain’s long-
protracted efforts to establish a peaceful
Palestine on the basis of Jewish-Arab
collaboration, Mr. Truman came out with
his party-political bluff demanding that
Britain should forthwith admit 100,000
Jewish immigrants into the Holy
Land; a demand made despite the
desperate protests of Mr. Bevin, who had
advance notice of it; and made simply
because, it was frankly admitted, if Mr.
Truman did not make that bid for the
American Jewish vote Mr. Dewey would.
Angrily, Mr. Bevin made the whole
of the transaction public. From that
moment Britain gave up the very difficult,
and always doubtful, task of reconciling
the Arabs and Jews. Instead, Britain put
the issue up to U.N.0., accompanied by
the gravest warnings, based on its own
experience, that the problem did not
admit of any easy solution, that such a
solution as partition would be certain to
lead to unprecedented violence, and that,
for its part, Britain would take no hand,
either separately or jointly, in implement-
ing any such decision, but would end its
thankless mandate and get out.
In effect, what Britain did was to call
the American party-political bluff. As
well as the damaging interference by the
highest American quarter, there had been
all through the bitterly-resented but
patiently-borne anti-British propaganda
published widely in the American press
and broadcast. Most of it was in the
form of advertisements —the organs
spreading it could defend themselves on
that ground—nonetheless' it was savagely
brutal and false, and little appeared in
contradiction or disapproval. It openly
incited, it caused and it applauded the
murder of British troops in the Holy
Land. There is a limit even to British
patience, and at last it snapped.
Yet the element of bluff remained to
condition and bedevil the U.N.O. proceed-
ings. The most explicit statements by
Britain that it was done with this thing
for good and all were not believed. It
was still wishfully accepted that Britain
was bluffing. The Arabs —as members in
U.N.O. and away from U.N.O. —as ex-
plicitly reiterated that they would
fight against partition, not merely in the
political sense of “fight,” but actually
with arms. Zionists asserted, and
U.N.O. accepted, that the Arabs were
also bluffing. To dismiss the Arab case
the U.N.O. Solomons would have had
to admit that all such peoples as, say,
the Maoris must be given back their
once-owned land. The U.N.O. Solomons
did not dismiss the Arab case; they
ignored it and all the warnings accom-
panying it.
On those assumptions of mere bluffing,
the U.N.O. Solomons—or some of them
—acted. There was another assumption,
fed by the Zionist party and just as
falsely based. Repeatedly Zionist leaders
insisted that their Hagana force could
cope with any Arab opposition. This the
U.N.O. Solomons —or some of them —be-
lieved or affected to believe. It was a
calculated Zionist bluff, the calculation
being that once U.N.O. decided on par-
tition, U.N.O. would be morally obliged
to'do the enforcing.
Thirty-three U.N.O. Solomons —among
them “Australia” —supported the action
based on those assumptions. The voting
was 33 to 13, with 10 abstentions and one
absence. Thus, if U.N.O, were more than
a face-saving fa?ade, the required two-
thirds majority might not have been
obtained. However, in that fashion
it was, with some who had voiced very
strong doubts lobbied in the meantime
into voting in support. And U.N.O. had
added its own monstrous bluff: this being
that, even if all the other assumptions (re-
garding Britain and the Arabs particu-
larly) proved wrong, as they have done,
the supposed status and prestige of
U.N.O. would still work the oracle.
That final monstrous bluff is now in
process of being called and exposed in
all its hollowness. U.N.O.’s presumed
prestige is spurned as a myth ; its physical
force amounts to 100 blue-uniformed
guards employed in keeping order at
U.N.O.’s headquarters, and the force
reckoned necessary for the job is one
of 50,000. Britain will lay down its man-
date in about six weeks from now,
after which, U.N.O.’s own advance party
on the spot has predicted, there would
have been “administrative chaos and
widespread strife and bloodshed.”
Dr. Evatt is welcome to his share of
the credit for the decision of the U.N.O.
Solomons. He has always been one of
the most voluble of them all, and on his
return to Australia he identified himself
further with that particular decision by
specially holding it up for admiration and
applause.
The impasse to which Uncle Sam
has been brought demands for a full
appreciation of it a liberal garnishing of
oil. In this respect it apparently was
assumed that the economic succor Uncle
Sam lavishly offered would sway Arab
policy; more bluntly, that the Arabs
would be happy to take the cash in hand
and waive the rest, and the oil would go
on flowing from the desert sands. There
could, perhaps, have been an alternative
line of policy-reasoning behind what
amounted to daring the Arabs to do the
worst they threatened. It has been sug-
gested that on the highest levels of policy-
making the plan was that Uncle Sam
would take the Arab kick and hold the
Jew friendship, while J. Bull would play
the opposite role. And so the oil would
still flow.
It is further suggested that the Arabs
saw through that game, and that they
wrecked it when Irak disowned the
Mutual-defence Treaty between itself
and Britain which, to the tune of much
inspired British rejoicing, had been made
in London.
Whatever truth there may be in that.
Uncle Sam, out of a process of mixing
international affairs with domestic politics,
became the villain of the piece in Arab
eyes. Uncle Sam does not relish the role
of villain, and, above all, he could not
afford the luxury of allowing the Arab
hostility to shut off the flow of oil. In
this dilemma there was resort to the
element noted as overriding the proceed-
ings throughout. The bluff now took the
form of insistence on continued U.S.
support of partition; but at the same
time it was insisted that the .part of
any U.N.O. armed force would not be
that of enforcing the partition but of
maintaining the peace. The hard fact is
that the tragic events in Palestine were
moving too fast both for the creating of
such a force and for American party
politics.
The confused issue has other points
just as sharply uncomfortable for Unoe
Sam. Now thoroughly disillusioned from
its sentimental regard for Soviet Russia,
America most definitely could not agree
to Soviet troops in Palestine on the kind
of conditions the Kremlin would insist
on. Congress was not likely to authorise
the use of American troops to
attempt the job Britain has found so
tragically costly and thankless. And,
further, not only was the U.S. support
of partition restricted to the political
leaders, but it was most strongly opposed
by the nation’s military leaders.
On all counts, there was little choice
for Uncle Sam but to abandon the U.N_U.
“triumph,” on which the head of U.NU. s
own Palestine Commission has the final
word: “Only fools boast about erecting
a building on shifting sands.”


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Press and Communists.
Written beside a turned-down glass:
Communism is organised envy, greed and hate,
so it is everywhere assured of support from
people dominated by these detestable feelings.
It draws to itself all the elements which, when
the rule of law fails or ceases to restrain, form
into brutal mobs. But in this country it could
never have attained the strength for evil it is
foully exhibiting without the aid of partial
journalism—the kind of journalism that pictured
ill-conditioned Johnny-come-latelys as interest-
ing public characters and their Russian leaders
as paragons of efficiency in every department
and marvels, of military skill, therein putting to
shame those hopeless duffers the English.
This romantic fiction has perforce gone out
of fashion, but not without leaving false im-
pressions which linger or endure. And jour-
nalism which is ignorant and dishonest, even
if the dishonesty is not wilful, is still being
placed at Communists’ service. Some of the
“reporting” of last week’s street disturbances
in Brisbane might have been written by their
own hands and the substance of it was insci-
porated in their inflammatory propaganda.
For example, the people of Sydney and other
cities were informed in sensational stuff with
scare headlines that police had on Monday
batoned marching pickets bearing “big printed
placards.” One account began: “Police used
their batons this morning in a wild scene
when more than 400 strikers broke through
their on a march to the Trades
Hall.” The other was introduced with
the words “Police used their batons but
were unable to halt a march of railway-
strike pickets,” another choice bit baing “In
fierce melees they used their batons on the
hands of the pickets as they struggled to retain
possession.” Both accounts were false. Though
march and carrying of placards, all with insulting
Communist legends, were alike illegal and the
sorely-tried police—daily targets for foul in-
sults and repeatedly exposed to assault —would
have been justified in resorting to their batons
they used none.
This was expressly stated by the chief in-
spector in a report to Mr. Jones, the Minister
of Home Affairs, read by that gentleman in
the House. Said the justly indignant Minister:
This is not the first occasion in the
present emergency where exaggeration and
sensationalism by the press has occurred.
I consider that the press owes a duty to
the Government and the people to cor-
rectly report, without any misrepresentation,
any events that may take place.
Such reporting, Mr. Jones said, “can have
no other effect than to incite persons to further
disobedience of the law.” There was “further
disobedience of the law” on the very morning
his words were published.
Defying both State and municipal law and
carrying a coffin (“Trade-unionism”) and ban-
ners, some the color and shape of shamrocks,
and all mounted on “stout sticks,” a Com-
munist-led mob, 140 in number, went looking
for trouble and got it with efficiency and
dispatch. According to a “Courier-Mail” man
the “clash” \vas all over in 45 seconds, and
though the police “had batons in their cuffs
and hip-pockets,” he did not see any used.
But a Sydney “Morning Herald” reporter in-
sisted that police “drew their batons” and
that there ensued “a bloody struggle,” after
which “Australia’s only Communist member,
Mr. Fred Paterson,” and “a member of the
Australian Railways Union, Mr. John Grayson,”
were carried to hospital; “both had concus-
sion.”
Communist union leaders were prepared for
“the bloody struggle,” and had their propaganda
ready, also plans for “indignation strikes,”
which broke out in various places. That night
Sydney was flooded with leaflets headed “Batons
and Blood of the Police State —Paterson Brutally
Bashed.” Headlines and other bits about
.Paterson (“seriously injured; first victim of the
baton assault”) were late introductions; the
body of the leaflet must have been in type
for days.
In a plain and unvarnished statement to the
House Mr. Hanlon said that Paterson and
Julius, another Communist barrister, “accom-
panied the, procession with writing-pads and
pencils, knowing that there was going to be
a breach of the law.” The “processionists”
marched in military formation, and their placards
were “nailed to hardwood sticks 3ft. 6in. long
and an inch square, roughly sawn and
with sharp corners,” obviously intended
for use. They were halted and warned to
disperse. Instead they tried to force their way
through the police. Paterson, walking
along the footpath, was hit from behind, and
as “an act of charity,” by him accepted, was
taken to the ambulance-station by detectives.
Another man who was “knocked about,”
identified in one account as Grayson, was
hit by a civilian at whom he had aimed a
punch, and who had given his name to the
police.
I am satisfied that the police used every
effort to pacify this illegal procession. Any
disturbance that ensued was forced by its
leaders. If a hundred and fifty men could
take possession of the streets today, there
would be no reason to prevent fifteen hun-
dred doing the same tomorrow.
Patent, of course, to everyone who respects
law and order and wants to be guarded against
a Communist insurrection, in Stalin’s words
to Ribbentrop on the extinction of Poland,
“cemented in blood.”
But newspapers whose editors should have
known better persisted in making a martyr
of Paterson. His skull had been fractured. He
had a “severe brain injury.” He was in a
serious condition. Yet three or four hours
after this frightful damage was inflicted on
him (and more was catalogued) he was able
to give a 250-word statement to reporters—a
statement in which he admitted that he didn’t
know who hit him and had certainly not been
hit by a detective with whom he had been
talking, and that the officers who attended to
him were “very decent and kind.” He improved
so rapidly that the issue of bulletins ceased.
And the “concussion”-caSe Grayson was soon
walking about as large as life.
Sphinx or Squib?
It is surely one of the functions of the
leader of a country to give a lead to his
people on questions of* national import-
ance. In the past month events have
been crowding in upon each other. The
Communist coup in Czechoslovakia
brought forth condemnation from the
Governments in London, Washington and
Paris ; from Canberra came only silence.
Masaryk went to his death. Shocked
comment was made by British Ministers,
by General Smuts, by President Truman.
The Canadian Government endorsed the
previous condemnation of the Gottwald
clique by Britain, U.S. and France.
Chifley said not a word.
In Brussels, Britain, France and the
Benelux countries signed a 50-year pact,
surely an item in which Australia should
be vitally interested. Australia perhaps ,
Chifley no. He stayed mum.
President Truman appealed to Congress
to reintroduce conscription, and gave
Russia a blunt warning that further
aggression meant war. European
countries applauded his action ; Canada’s
Prime Minister told his party the inter-
national situation had never been worse.
Chifley declined to comment.
The Queensland strike continued its
ruinous course. A New Zealand Minister
remarked that unless Mr. Hanlon won
the fight the Communists would gain
control of all Australia. Australia’s
“leader” said nothing. The silence of
strength? Or the silence.of a squib?
Manus.
Manus Island, in the Admiralties, is
rapidly reverting to pre-war uselessness,
and at the week-end it appeared that a
Chinese labor force there was defying
the few remaining Australian officials.
With possibility of war against Russia
generally accepted, Chifley’s equanimity
notwithstanding, the island as a powerful
THE INCOMPLEAT ANGLER.
American base wouk} have been invalu-
able to Australia’s 7 defence of her
northern seaboard.
Now aerodromes used to handling vast
air fleets are cracked and grown with
weeds. Three hundred miles of once-
sound coral roads are breaking into pot-
holes. The 45,000 Quonset huts and
machine-shops which housed 32,000 men
and serviced the American Pacific fleet
at the height of the war sprawl rusted
and empty. Of six long piers, capable
of unloading hundreds of tons of equip-
ment an hour, two remain, in dubious use.
The R.A.N. is making valiant efforts to
salvage what it can for its own small
purposes.
Canberra is to blame for the loss of
what was, and still could be but for its
vacillating policy, one of the southern
Pacific’s strongest bases.
Stark Totalitarians.
Citizens who look with equanimity on
the socialist trends of Commonwealth
legislation might be startled if they were
to delve into a few of the pamphlets which
are to be readily bought in all Communist
bookshops, but which are not issued by
avowed Communists.
There is one, for instance, published
by the Australian Railways Union, called
A Trade-union Plan for Post-war Con-
struction. A notice on its back-cover
says that all A.R.U. branches, sub-
branches and committees are requested
to discuss this plan and to forward deci-
sions to I. F. Chappie, general secretary,
A.R.U., in Melbourne,
A few other people should discuss it,
since it is put forward by representatives
of a large body of civil servants who are
partly paid out of burdensome taxation,
they being—largely because of strikes,
go-slow and other tactics devised by Com-
munists—unable to pull their weight as
servants of the “people” for whom they
profess so strong a regard. Socialised
railways, in short, lose masses of public
money.
In one paragraph the document pro-
claims that the “Australian Council of
the Australian Railways Union” believes
that the needs of present-day civilisation
and the requirements of the future....
demand a complete change from capi-
talism to socialism.” And it sums up its
viewpoint with this:
We say that if it is possible to feed,
clothe, house and equip with costly appara-
tus of war Australians as soldiers, it is
equally possible to treat them similarly as
citizens, replacing the equipment of war
with the equipment of peace. We say that
if it is possible for the Commonwealth
Government to organise the nation for war;
to take to themselves, as they have .done
under the National Security Act and Regu-
lations for war purposes, power to control
and regulate all the industrial and financial .
resources of the Commonwealth, and autho-
rity to regulate and control the economic
and social life of the community so as to
regiment the people according to the Gov-
ernment’s view of the nation’s needs for
war purposes—then it is equally possible for
all these things to he done by the Com-
monwealth Government for the purpose of
peace.
Hitler himself never preached more stark,
brazen or unconstitutional totalitarianism.
And the startling feature of the matter is
that the New South Wales Secretary
of the body which puts this scheme for-
ward is president of the State Branch
of the A.L.P. from which Messrs. Chifley,
Evatt, Rosevear and others high in
Caucus draw their endorsements, and
that it was in his year of office that
nationalisation of banking and the plan
for perpetual price-fixing measures were
brought forward by the Commonwealth
Government.
If the Labor party were still justified
in using the name of “Labor” in its title,
except in derision, every person associ-
ated with such a scheme would long ago
have been rooted out as an enemy of the
basic principles of freedom and demo-
cracy. But “Labor” has ceased to be
Labor. It has become the chained captive
of the Communist party, or of persons
trained within the Communist party.
Queensland Coal.
The bill to bring it under State control
was introduced by Mines' Minister Foley
last week. Though it may have its faults,
and some of its ideas run pretty close to
socialisation, it is Premier Hanlon’s
answer to the long-sustained Communist-
cwm-Federal-Labor attempt to foist the
Chifley Joint Coal Board on his State —
an attempt which Hanlon fought all along
the line, since he rightly suspected one
of its prime objects was to bring the de-"
velopment of the vast Queensland coal
deposits under the control of the Com-
mo-run Miners’ Federation.
A summary of the proposals:
Improve, reorganise and mechanise where
possible the State coalfields. To ensure that
coal is produced regularly to meet local and
other demands. Jo keep prices at reason-
able levels. To provide for welfare of
workers and encourage co-operation between
management and employees. If necessary,
the board can take over and operate any
mine, and can kick out of the mining in-
dustry “any superintendent, manger, or
other person” acting “prejudicially” to the
industry. Any company can export freely
after local needs are met.
Mr. Foley was careful to say that the
bill in no way authorised industrial con-
scription, but he wasn’t too clear on
price-control, now a Federal matter,
merely hoping that it would return to the
State some time. Does' he, then, hope for
a “No” to the Evatt prices referendum?
There are to be three members of the
board, and the legislation does not, ac-
cording to Mr. Foley, affect existing
awards, pension schemes or workers’
compensation. The Powell Duffryn
people are now surveying the State coal-
fields to decide which are best suited for
mechanisation, including cleaning and
grading plant.
Various aspects of the bill will be
attacked by the Opposition parties, but
that is unlikely to worry the Hanlon
Government, since the bill’s best recom-
mendation to Queensland people is that
neither the Communists nor the Canberra
“Labor” crowd like it.
'Timber!**
Addressing delegates to a Timber In-
dustry Stabilisation Conference at Too-
woomba, E. H, F. Swain, formerly
Director of Forests in Queensland and
since Commissioner of Forests in N. S.
Wales, drew attention to a little-known
Russian asset of vast dimensions and let
in light on Russian manoeuvres in Fin-
.land, Poland and Germany.
Already in possession of five or six
times as much forest land as the rest of
Europe holds, the Russians had forced
the cession of extensive forest areas in
Finland and East Poland and had se-
cured control of 40 p.c. of German
forests. A great acquisition that,
can hang on to it, for before and between
the wars, as the Statesman’s Year-Book
has it, “forestry in Germany was an in-
dustry of great importance, conducted on
scientific methods.” Of 31,635,400 acres
mapped out in 1927, 9,110,040 acres were
under oak, birch, ash, beech and the
like, and 22,525,400 acres under pine,
larch, red and white fir and so forth.
Possession of all these forests, Mr.
Swain said, gives Russia “the key to the
world’s timber supply” when there is a
tremendous unsatisfied world demand.
What will the gentlemen in the Kremlin
do with “the key”? Use it to bargain
with the democracies when bluff has
ceased to serve their purpose? Who
knows?
Mr. Swain did not enter into these
speculations. But he insisted, rightly,
that “Australia must produce its own
timber, which it can grow faster than
can any other part of the world.” There-
upon Queensland Forests Director
Grenning said his department had de-
cided to plant 200,000 acres of soft-
woods, which would be “sufficient to
meet bread-and-butter needs.” It has
been found in Westralian pine plantations
that super, stimulates growth, making in
selected plots all the difference between
healthy and unhealthy trees.
Westralia .was not represented at the
Toowoomba conference, which was for
Eastern States only. Still possessed of
splendid hardwood forests in the south-
west, the State is helping to supply the
jarrah and karri needs of its partners in the
Commonwealth, as well as its own; but,
because of “controls” and a chronic labor
shortage, annual output of sawn timber is
not 70 per cent, of the regulation cut.
With the recovery of the Asian market
export of sandalwood has revived and
is expected to yield £lOO,OOO during the
year to June 30. Mallet-bark will also
come into the picture again when 17,000
acres of trees, planted in tardy atonement
for reckless waste of what could have
been made a permanent source of wealth
—Germany was the principal buyer —are
ready for thinning, though this will not
be for two or three years. Reckless
waste and tardy reforestation are com-
mon to all the States.
There remains the Mandated Territory
as a source of supply; but that is an-
other story, a tale to be told.
Abuse of Section 92.
Section 92 of the Commonwealth Con-
stitution, in the news again, has never
been altered or amended in any way, and
it stands as explicit today as when first
printed:
On the imposition of uniform duties of
Customs, trade, commerce and intercourse
among the States, whether by means of
internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall
be absolutely free.
Yet the States themselves are not above
abusing it for their own ends. In the
shilly-shallying that went on between the
Sydney and Canberra “Labor” crowds
about petrol required for road trucks to
carry urgently-needed food and other
things to Commo-beleaguered Queens-
land, it presently came out that, when
private road-hauliers in N.S.W. finally
got everything teed-up to begin the car-
riage of goods, they were held up for
several days awaiting Queensland permits
for N.S.W. trucks to cross the border.
In this day and age, when, night
and day and often in secret, our liberty
is slowly being whittled away by an
evergrowing and increasingly reckless
State and Federal bureaucracy, deliber-
ate and direct infringements of the Com-
monwealth Constitution don’t disturb its
elected guardians. They prefer to regard
it as a nuisance, to be abused and
held up to ridicule, obviously with the
intent of persuading the people that it
isn’t worth keeping in its present form.
Somehow the people persist in believing
that it is, which is why they are sus-
picious of attempts to amend it, as Dr.
Evatt will find out once again in May.

CARRERAS LTD. ■ "OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
On St. Patrick’s Day Brisbane saw a
Communist effort, as fatuous as it was
dangerous, to burst through the law
against intimidation by picketing.
Communist idiots armed a mob with
Eureka flags and placards colored
green, some cut in the form of
shamrocks and all fastened to ugly
sticks, and ordered it to march from
the Trades Hall to somewhere or other
singing “It’s a Great Day for the Irish”—
a Hollywood, not an Irish, song. The
effect of this upon a police force, noted
alike for its determination to uphold the
law and for its link with the Irish, and in-
structed to do its duty by a fighting
Premier named Hanlon, could have been
foreseen by all except Communist
louts. The police seized the placards,
the mob resisting—for 45 seconds. When
it had bolted the Communist M.L.A.
Patterson and one or two others were
down, and Communists in other parts
were vomiting lies and threats. It was a
great day for some Irish.
Told that Clarey, president of the
ignominious A.C.T.U., was on his why
from Melbourne to Brisbane to “settle”
the strikes, Hanlon said “He is not going
to rub my face in the dust” —Clarey’s
natural element —“to do it.” If war
comes this resolute Old Digger may find
himself called upon, temporarily, any-
way, to lead the nation. His party has
no other Man in sight.
Forced to choose between Arabs, with
oil, and Jews, with votes, the U.S.A. has
decided for the Arabs, in the process
abandoning Dr. Evatt’s darling plan for
the partition of Palestine. At the same
time the U.S.A., Britain and France have
come out for the return of Trieste to the
Italians. Inconsistent, of course, on the
U.S.A.’s part, but necessary steps in the
calling of Moscow’s bluff.
N.S.W. coal production is half a mil-
lion tons down this year, and further
losses are threatened by Williams, the
Communist president of the Miners’
Federation, who comes from Wales. It
would mean wholesale unemployment, in
the B.H.P. enterprises for a beginning.
Gloating over the position and prospect.
Brown, the Communist boss of the Vic-
torian railwaymen, said “Let Mr. Holl-
way and his colleagues run Victoria with-
out coal, for they won’t be getting any
soon.” Better # men have been hanged for
less. ,
The A.N.A. in Victoria generally
chooses a good man for leader, and it
has a very good one this year in W. O.
Fulton, C.P. member for Gippsland
North. In his presidential address at Bal-
larat Fulton left delegates in no doubt
as to his views:
Bribery and corruption are rampant in
high and low places... .Not one commodity
essential for development is obtainable un-
less by permit or blackmarket... .Worship-
ping of a foreign country and its ideology
is having a great effect on our national
life... .Extravagance, waste and the taxation
system are killing initiative, though in work
and production and a regard for enter-
prise and thrift lies the only way of avoid-
ing a debacle.... Certain clergymen, pro-
fessors and other pale pinks are trying to
' have the White Australia policy altered.
It must be maintained at all costs.
Agreed ; but, though the Old Digger does
not say so, the White Australia policy
cannot be “maintained” by neglecting the
defences, or by fostering nasty quarrels
with Malaya or China, as Calwell is do-
ing in his provocative fashion.
Last year, though Australian airlines
carried 60 p.c. more passengers than in
1946, T.-A.A. could fill only 56.9 p.c. of
its seats, whereas the privately-operated
A.N.A. and Ansett lines filled 70 p.c.,
Ansetts nearly doubling their passenger
miles. The Government show is trying
to hog business by cutting fares and even
undercutting small road-transport con-
cerns. It won’t mean any reduction of its
vast losses —half a million in its first
year.
According to the “Wall Street Journal”
American buyers are holding off the
Australian wool market because the staple
is too dear. It makes the point that we
sell to other cbuntries whose currency
is no good to us because we can’t buy
things we want from them. True or
not, no American is going to buy wool
here and then see it stuck up on wharves
and in stores for weeks on end by Com-
munist action in contempt of the whole
body of industrial law.
Naive note from the Australian Wool
Board’s “news service”:
March 16: Certain Central European
countries prominent at the last London
wool sales do not appear to be represented
this time.
Czechoslovakia had no need to be repre-
sented. Always vicariously generous,
Chifley gave it “a credit £500,000 for
buying wool” last June.
Wheatgrowers have been told by
Pollard that they’re to get another 10yd.
a bushel for their 1946-47 wheat. And
they are expected to be grateful to the
nice kind “Government” at Canberra,
which intends to “give” them £4,300,000
out of the money it took from them for its
“stabilisation fund,” the gift being “sub-
ject to the international wheat agreement
becoming operative in August.” A lot
of things may happen before August.
When Finnan passed from Tourist
Activities and Immigration to Labor and
Industry he found himself responsible for
an uncontrollable child. Called a Bill to
Enforce Home Deliveries, the infant was
born in the McGirr policy speech and has
survived all attempts to do it in. Caucus
didn’t want it, but union bosses did, and
Haddock jumps when union bosses
whistle; so it is 1 to come before Parlia-
ment after Easter. Making the thing
effective will be about as easy as preserv-
ing ice-cream in Hades.
A few Sydney housewives became
starry-eyed when they learned that Minis-
ter Haddock (no. Finnan) was going to
make tradesmen deliver things to the
door. Then they read that “hundreds of
tons of edible peaches” were to be
dumped at Leeton because “prices are so
low in Sydney.” Whereupon they went
forth with the old string-bag to buy
peaches and found the prices “so low in
Sydney” 3d. to sd. each. Then their
faces took on the old careworn expres-
sion.
With another war threatened “Labor”
will naturally be looking for ways of
economising in the only field in which
it ever practises economy—defence. A
sarcastic naval man points out that in
the prevailing shortage of men and ships
in the R.A.N., the mine-sweeping flotilla
could return to base and leave its under-
sea gardens where they are. Moored
mines remain lethal weapons for eight
years.
One of those Communist women, all
ravishingly beautiful to the young lions
of Sydney “D.T.” before the leonine tails
went down, bobbed up in Cowra (N.S.W.)
to address a public meeting called by the
Communist party. But in Cowra, as in
other parts, they’ve been thinking long,
long thoughts about Communists, and
speaker and party had the mortifica-
tion of hearing the meeting carry a reso-
lution in favor of declaring the whole
Communist outfit illegal and wind up
with the National Anthem. Apropos of
beauty, the high priestess of Commu-
nism is the Rumanian “Foreign Mini-
ster,” Anna Pauker. Judging by her
photographs—and, like Stalin, she has
them stuck up everywhere—Anna Pauker
is the ugliest woman in Europe,
Sydney “Labor” heads had it all sewn
up. The railway triumvirate to succeed
Hartigan was to consist of Garside (chair-
man), Winsor, formerly president of the
Railway Officers and now Superintendent
of Staff, and Ferguson, th 6 A.R.U.
and A.L.P. spouter, who has been every-
thing by turns, as “employees’ represen-
tative.” The road transport setup to take
over when Neale goes was' to include
Brock, the tramwaymen’s secretary.
Ferguson settled his hash by barging in
to help the Communists in their effort to
wreck Hanlon’s Government. That meant
the exclusion of Brock, for even the Mc-
Girrs couldn’t very well leave one picked
union man out and put the other in.
Brock’s thoughts, if imprinted on asbes-
tos, would burn a hole in it.
Until last week, when it was denied
that Chinese left in Manus were careering
round with arms in their hands,
there had been a sudden cessation of
published communications from Ward’s
office (Transport and External Terri-
tories). However, the “West Australian”
had one. It was to the effect that Ward
“welcomed the decision of the Westralian
Government to support the plan for the
standardisation of railway gauges” and
was prepared to do business with
Queensland. It was printed on March
11. Why, that was the day on which ex-
“liaison-officer” Garden, his son and two
others were committed for trial on the
charge of conspiracy, after counsel for
the defence had made remarks which
only Ward’s effigy could have “wel-
comed”—that is, if he has an effigy, and
if effigies ever “welcome” anything.
Somebody put a stopwatch on the
Communist shindy in which Paterson
was hit over the head, probably
by one of his own side, and another
Com. was smitten on the nose by a by-
stander whom he attacked, mistaking
him for a policeman. It lasted nearly as
long as the Eureka scrimmage, on which
the Corns, have cashed-in for more than
it is worth. A Eureka flag was borne into
the “battle” by “Mick Healy,” secretary
of the Trades and Labor Council, who
never heard of Eureka before he arrived
in Queensland, via N.Z., from the north
of Ireland —as McCracken.
An ill-advised English concern is mak-
ing a Eureka film, with a long, thin Aus-
tralian, accent and all, trying to imperson-
ate the stocky Lalor and reproduce Peter’s
brogue. To avert a box-office famine it
will have to keep the approaches to
cinema theatres clear of Eureka Youth
louts and full-grown, Communist larrikins
by any means short of assault and battery.
W. D. Johnson was “Labor” M.L.A.
for Guildford-Midland (formerly called
Guildford) for 36 years. His last majority
(March, 1947) was 1079, The A.L.P.
nominated Brady for the vacancy caused
by Johnson’s death, and, persuading itself
that the McLarty-Watts Government was
slipping and that the plethora of candi-
dates (seven) would help its man, it pre-
dicted that Brady would improve on
Johnson’s score. Actually, he beat
Grayden, the Liberal, by a mere 480, and
that on Communist preferences. In the
plight to which “Labor” is reduced it
has in these cases to depend on Com-
munist preferences, which accounts for a
lot of things.
Morbid note from Canberra:
More than one thing was overlooked by the
authors of the pretty plan for enlarging and
packing the Senate. Even if a way can be found
of enabling the 24 new Senators proposed
to be elected next year to take their seats be-
fore July 1, 1950, so as to validate the pro-
ceedings of Parliament at 1950 sittings prior to
that date —if validated they can be —Mother
Nature may have to be reckoned with.
Most of the “Labor” Senators from Victoria,
S.A. and Westralia, States in whose Parlia-
ments “Labor” .will be in a hopeless minority
for many a long day, are a thought elderly.
Of the South Australians Ward is 75, Beer-
worth 64 and O’Flaherty 62; of the Victorians
Cameron is 70, Katz in the sixties and Sheehan
59; of the Westralians, Harris and Nash are
58 and Fraser, though he doesn’t give his age,
admits to 36 years of married life.
If any or all of these Senators died in har-
ness as did Cunningham (W.A.), in 1943,
opponents would replace them, with unpleas-
antly, possibly fatal, consequences to the party
majority. And there has been a regrettable
mortality among old Federal politicians—mostly,
of course, retired—these latter years. The last
“Parliamentary Handbook” published in Nov.,
1945, records that 14 died in 1940, 15 in ’4l,
four in ’42, 10 in ’43, nine in ’44 (among
them was Dicky Darcey, from Hobart, who had
vacated his Senate seat only 26 days before), and
seven in 1945.
March and April are fateful months
in the political careers of McGirrs.
Gregory of that ilk arrived as M.L.A. for
Yass on March 5, 1913, got in again for
Yass on March 24, 1917, transferred to
Cootamundra on March 20, 1920 and
then to Sydney on March 25, 1922. By
grace of Gregory, Jim, the present
Premier, became M.L.A. for Coota-
mundra on March 25, 1922. Gregory
was sworn in as Minister of Health and
Motherhood on April 13, 1920, and was
passed out of those portfolios, in con-
sequence of a lost election on April 13,
1922 ; from the same cause he had to quit
politics on April 18, 1925. As No. 2to
Dooley, who became a Minister on April
13, 1920, and ceased to be Premier on
April 13, 1922, Greg, engaged in an open
hullabaloo with that worthy and was
adjudged by a cynic of the period to
have lost it because he was all gas and no
guts. In their anger at the ignominous
sell-out to Communists, Bruxner and
Treatt have put the same brand on Jim.
British “Labor” has ceased to be able
to boast that it is doing famously in by-
elections. Its latest and worst reverse
occurred in North Croydon, where, at
the general election, H. U. Willink,
Churchill’s Minister of Health, got only
23,417 of 56,941 effective votes polled,
though he scrambled back with a majority
of 607 over the “Labor” candidate, a
lady. At the by-election the Conserva-
tive, Harris, defeated the “Labor”
nominee by 11,664 and had an absolute
majority of 5343. Yet he was up
against distinguished men in the writer
Harold Nicolson (Lab.), a Nat.-Lab.
M.P. for 10 years, 1935-45, and Parlia-
mentary Secretary for Information in
1940-41 ; and the Queensland-born Air
Vice-Marshal Bennett (Lib.), who sat
for Middlesborough West in May-July,
1945.
Oldham, the Victorian Attorney-
General, after looking into the prices-
referendum proposals, set down some of
the powers which a “yes” vote would give
to Canberra:
By-passing of all arbitration awards.
Fixing of all rents and prices and of
charges and rates imposed by the State
Governments and local-government bodies.
Determining doctors’ bills and the pay of
jobbing-gardeners, world without end.
All concealed in what Dr. Evatt calls
“reserve powers, to be exercised only
in times of need.” Australians have had
his cro.wd’s “reserve powers” and its
ideas of what constitute “times of need.”
Days before Canberra shut-up shop
this occurred in the case in which the
former M.H.R. and “liaison officer”
Garden, his son Harcourt, Farrell and
Parer are charged with conspiracy to
defraud;
Shand, K.C., prosecuting for the Crown,
to R. M. Service, sometime Army Inven-
tions Directorate manager: “Didn’t you say
this to me in my chambers in the presence
of three witnesses: ‘Farrell said he had
seen the Minister [Ward] and was directed
to pass all communications through
Garden?’ ” —“Correct.”
“That is in direct contradiction to what
you have sworn today?”—“Yes.”
Witness treated as hostile. Hearing ad-
journed from Friday to Monday.
Witness, appealing to the magistrate for
protection, admits that what he said to Mr.
Shand was true, an addition being that he
“did not wish to give evidence that would
be embarrassing or injurious to the
Minister.”
Didn’t the Opposition read it? If so it
said nothing “embarrassing to the
Minister,” though the Minister’s favorite
term for its leaders during his Brisbane-
line period was “Quislings,”
Picked up at Canberra, and evidently
written by someone trying his hand at a
parody of the Highlanders’ lament in the
“Canadian Boat Song”:—•
Come, civil strife, let discord burst in slaughter,
A cave or hollow log we then implore;
No blood we’ll shed —it turns at once to water,
Our spines to jelly, when the Commos roar.


MAKING IT QUITE CLEAR.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Macnell”: Faces in the street (B.
10/3/’48)? “Pitt St.” should spend five
minutes outside a Quay pet-shop. In
the window half a dozen pups, and some-
times a kitten or so, put on a show for
the faces peering through the glass.
There’s nothing more lovable than acouple
of midget foxies tugging at each other’s
ears; the crowd’s faces prove it. A
schoolboy is openly delighted ; a flapper
forgets to preen herself. A shabby
woman laden with market shopping
crosses the street a few paces behind her
slouching husband. He stops at the win-
dow. She comes up, stands beside him,
and for a moment as her tired face re-
laxes there is something recaptured be-
tween them. Perhaps, years ago, they
had a dog. He jerks his head impatiently
and she follows him quayward. A bulky
laborer slips his toolbag to the foot-
path and grins through the dirt at a
little black stomach that can wriggle no
further over the restraining partition.
Then the dealer’s hand dives into the
melee and emerges with a pint-sized
cocker. All eyes follow to the counter,
scan the buyer. It is easy to agree with
the caption painted across the window:
“The only love money can buy.”
* * * *
“Plop”: Sydney’s George-street is
being dug up and hurled into the
ignominy of the gutter, not without pro-
testing. All day long the old roadway
“ Tin-openers, third floor."
bellows anguish at the pneumatic-drills
and the high-speed grinders they use in
buffing-down its tramlines; when the
face-lifting is completed the street will
look at itself in shop windows and prob-
ably think it was all worth while. Mean-
while those humans whose shops are set
along it are galloping towards a nervous
breakdown. It is becoming common,
when entering these establishments, to see
an assistant shouting at a customer to
be heard above the din. Suddenly the
drilling stops and leaves the salesman
roaring amid perfect* quiet “They’re the
best underpants on the market, sir. Look
at that seat. Tough as bags.” That sort
of thing is very bad for business. Out
on the street things are even worse, and
the saddest case yet seen was an ageing
gentleman, snookered amid the rubble
in the middle of the road, with the com-
plete terrifying orchestra on one side
and an approaching tram on the other.
Panicking, he darted like a rabbit, nearly
collected the tram and a taxi and finally
got back, in a cold sweat, to the side he’d
started from. He’s probably still there,
* * * *
“Jemac”: The flapper stepped daintily
across George-street’s bared ribs and
halted beside a workman smoothing tram-
line welds with a powered emery-wheel.
He applied his wheel to the line. A
fiery stream of sparks played over the
girl’s legs. She jumped like a stung horse.
In a voice as musical as the tram-brakes
that just saved her skin she told the navvy
what she thought of him. Not only had
he burnt her skin and frightened the
daylights out of her, but, crowning
crime, he’d ruined her nylons.
• * * •
“Oliver Filter”: The rash of adver-
tising for refrigerators has apparently
moved the Associated Conglomeration of
Ice Manufacturers, or some similar body,
to come out in defence of the good old
ice-chest. At the local flea-hatchery the
other .night the audience was treated to
a short film eulogising the merits of ice.
A smart-looking fellow was depicted
entering a house and carefully depositing
the block in the ice-chest; there were a
few well-mannered murmurs from the
audience about “the blokes who leave
the ruddy stuff on the front doorstep,”
then the iceman in the film, after closing
the door of the ice-chest, took a cloth
from his pocket and carefully wiped the
chest to remove any finger-marks or
water he may have left. The mighty
howl of derision that went up from the
audience led me to believe that —er —
well, that icemen call at quite a number
of homes in our suburb.

“Here’s Cheer”: Those with any regard
for posterity’s opinion of them are
advised to write their own obituaries
before it is too late —otherwise they might
collect something like those gathered re-
cently under “Fame’s Fleeting Breath”
in an American paper;
Charles H. Lyon: He invented the
upside-down pipe. Ana Cupanas: She “put
the finger” on John Dillinger for the
F. 8.1. Eli Witt: He was the first to clothe
cigars in cellophane. Charles B. Core: He
had more pictures rejected by the British
Royal Academy than any other artist.
The only person on the list who came
out with real credit, an obvious loss to
mankind in general, was Senator W. J.
Haver, of Ontario:
He never made a speech during 29 years
in the Canadian Senate.
* * * ♦
“V. Cluse”: Early last year our gas
supply became weak and intermittent. A
ring to the gas company brought the
advice that experts would attend to it.
Three hours later two men arrived, ex-
amined the supply and decided that there
was water in the pipes. They departed
without curing the fault. I got home to
find the missus between tears and bad
language, no tea cooked and the gas still
on the blink. Rang the company. Two
men were on the way. They arrived just
on dark, dug a small hole, unscrewed a
plug on the tail-pipe, solemnly watched
the water drain out, rescrewed the plug
and filled in the hole. As a witness of
these proceedings I inquired why the first
two hadn’t done the job. “Oh,” was
the reply, “they’re fitters. This was
plumbers’ work.” Last month the trouble
“Not so much excitement , Pop — they’re not yours!"
recurred and, rather than cause an inter-
union dispute that might tie up the
nation’s industry, I did the job myself. I
was careful to do it in the dead of night,
but somehow the secret must have got
out, for a gas company truck has crawled
slowly past our gate several times lately
and four suspicious eyes have inspected
the new turf that hides the hole.
« * * V
“Philp”: It’s probably a reflection on
our education system that the “Quiz
Kids” can tell like a shot what a llama
has for breakfast or what is the most
popular drink in Nigeria, but are often
floored by questions about their own
country. Asked “What is the Fremantle
Doctor?” they hummed and hawed for
as long as possible before they were
“gonged,” and even the quizmaster was
a bit shaky with his explanation—“a
cooling breeze that blows up the Swan
River.” The westerly which blows in
across Perth and its suburbs nearly every
, afternoon would have to follow a more
tortuous course than a cockeyed-bob to
find its way up the twists and loops of
the placid Swan.
♦ * » *
“Flathead” : In my car I desire only
four wheels and an engine, and after
three years’ fruitless search for this ideal
I was pleased that at least I was not
soured on life. Then I read a General
Motors report on recent developments
in the industry. “Experts,” I found,,
“have been appointed to the staff to deter-
mine what sections of the American
nation prefer what colors in the family
car.” Texas dwellers are claimed to
“favor hues that vie with the brilliance
of their sunsets,” while New Englanders
choose “sombre hues reflecting their
native conservatism.” Something snapped,
but I read on, snarling:
Intellectuals like blue, athletes red,
egoists yellow, and the back-slapping ex-
traverts go for orange.
If anyone knows of a bright-purple “T”
Ford, which should now suit my tempera-
ment perfectly, I’d be greatly obliged to
have its stable number.
# ♦ ■ * *
“Pookie”: At this stage of the beer
strike Sydney is full of men complaining
that they have never felt so well in their
lives.
* * * *
“Clooter”; I suppose there are tricks
in every trade ; still, I was somewhat as-
tonished to come across this advertise-
ment in a church paper;
' Small cottage, 30 miles city (2 bedrooms,
no mod. cons.), nominal rent, offered re-
tired priest desiring home and garden.
Opportunity for exercising ministry in volun-
tary capacity. Possibly paid duty near-by
parish.
If I were such a man I should be glad
of that garden, for a garden is a pleasant
place in which to reflect. Who knows,
in between reflecting on the “no mod
cons.” and the rewards of a devoted and
onerous life, one could always sketch a
sermon to be given buckshee while exer-
cising the buckshee ministry. And think
of those moments of holy joy when an
order came for a baptism or marriage
service in the “near-by parish.”
* * * *
“Jasby”: There’s no doubt the Irish
take a lot of understanding. They’ve
been struggling for three centuries to get
the English landlords out of Ireland and
now they’re trying to coax ’em back
again. At least that is the only interpre-
tation that can be put to an advertisement
in a recent Calcutta “Statesman.” Ad-
dressed obviously to Army officers and
civil servants made surplus by Indian in-
dependence, it invites “those about to
retire on fixed incomes and pensions” to
consider the “numerous advantages of
Eire as a future place of residence,” The
advantages listed include “low taxes, a
surplus of labor . and domestic servants,
the finest sport in Europe and excellent
opportunities for the small or large
farmer.” I don’t know how the jungle
wallahs are responding to the invitation,
but if history is any guide it should get
’em in. After all, the inducements are
very much the same as those that
attracted Englishmen to Ireland in
Strongbow’s time and the appeal of James
I for settlers for his Ulster Plantation
were probably couched in much the same
terms.
<» * * *
“Millswyn”: “Hamfat’s” reference to
stage props (B. 3/4/’4B) will cause many
an old “laddie” to nod his poll in sweet
remembrance ; but there’s one piece of
stage business he didn’t mention. It
consisted of the villain’s placing beneath
the fingernails of his right hand some
carmine grease-paint and then “scratch-
ing” the face of the heroine. Believe
me, old boy, more reaction came from
the male members of the audience than
from the females.
* * * *
“Conda”: The special crew of the
Royal yacht is out of a job; she’s to
be scrapped. Built in 1899, the graceful
craft has borne more crowned heads
than any ship afloat; her crew was wholly
naval, but their dress differed from
normal. All badges of rank were silver
instead of gold, the cap tally was black,
with the words “Royal Yacht” in gold
wire, and jumpers were worn inside bell-
bottoms. Though used infrequently, the
gleaming craft was kept in a spotless con-
dition. A glittering gangway, all brass
and scrubbed-white canvas, led to decks
holystoned to the whiteness of a hound’s
tooth. Her boats were 30ft. galleys, used
by the King for sailing. Hulls were
painted royal-blue, and shone glossily;
tackle-blocks were hand-burnished until
they sparkled like electroplate ; sheets and
halliards were blancoed to whiteness, and
rigging, bell-ropes, tiller and stern-
cushions adorned by ropework intricacies
bespeaking years of experience. During
the war she billeted petty-officers quali-
fied for warrant rank in staterooms which
once knew the crowned heads and am-
bassadors of all the courts of Europe.
A new yacht was authorised under Navy
estimates for 1939, but the war delayed
its building until now.
* * * *
“Rider Mac”: Left out of “Ceg’s”
mouth - watering reminiscences (B
10/3/’4B) were the eight-a-penny black
aniseed-balls. The kids down our street
used to buy ’em, play marbles with ’em
and eat ’em afterwards. They still tasted
pretty good.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket”; One of the trite
cynicisms that gets my goat is “Money
is all that matters nowadays.” My an-
cestor, Sir Percy de Pawnticket, made the
remark 700 years ago when somebody
else got the comely lord-lieutenancy he
had set his heart on; and disgruntled
Pawntickets have been consoling them-
selves with the same hogwash ever since.
Probably the foolishness goes back to
earliest history; Cain may have built up
his spleen for the murder of his brother
with the idea that, “nowadays,” Abels
cash outweighed his own just deserts in
awards of earth’s gifts. The power ot
money and possessions has been a factor
for winning special prizes since the world
began, and the habit of throwing in that
unnecessary “nowadays” as if the world
had only gone bad in this point of view
during the last few years is certainly an
irritation.
AIR-SHY.
“John Bromwich was not included in Australia’s
Davis Cup team after he had made it clear to the
selectors that ‘on no condition would he travel by
air.’ ”
“The feathered race with pinions skim the air,
Not so the mackerel, and still less the bear,”
Some poet tells us —Frere, to be exact —
Enunciating an undoubted fact.
But times have changed since then, one needs
must own,
And not for bear and mackerel alone.
Few things that may not fly can’t now be
flown,
Toted across the world with little fuss,
From genus homo to the platypus.
Most take it equably, but hardly all.
A few there are who face at duty’s call
What’s an ordeal to them. One hears a buzz
Of talk that this is what Doc. Evatt does.
Air travel gives him what is termed the pip,
It’s only patriotic statesmanship
Steels him to bear it with stiff upper lip.
There’s no explaining little things like these;
We mostly have our private allergies.
Take Bromwich for an instance. Trained to
dash
Bird-like about the courts to swipe and smash,
To make the wiliest return his meat
And sweep opposing couples off their feet,
For transport purposes he views the sky
Above, the spacious firmament on high.
Still with implacable antipathy.
For ’vantage he’ll adventure anywhere
That inclination points —but not by air.
Where racquets swish and surging crowds line
up
To watch the contests for the Davis Cup
He’ll fill ho place, a matter for regret
Unquestionably, but no use to fret.
And anyhow, should that prized trophy stay
A bit beyond our grasp, as well it may,
Staunch tennis fans will have the chance to
say
With rueful emphasis it wouldn’t be there
Had Bromwich been induced to take the air.

Engraved on the haft of this fine specimen is a crest with the truculent motto

“Bo”: My quotation-a-day desk calendar
can usually be depended upon to produce
something appropriate for an anniversary.
I know, for instance, long before the
event, that Princess Margaret’s birthday
date will carry the inevitable line of
Tennyson: “Queen rose of a rosebud
garden of girls” ; that Melbourne Cup
day is a soda to be welcomed with the
old saw about no horse being able to
go as fast as the money you put on him.
There even seemed to be prescience in a
Shakspearean quotation on a day set
down for an appointment with my
dentist: “Give it an understanding, but
no tongue”—a reminder, surely, that
with my mouth agape and cluttered with
gadgets during a filling, I’d be expected
with a mixture of gurgles and nods to
do my part in a desultory conversation.
Then on a day last week I turned over
a page and found a quotation on the
anniversary of the founding of the Syd-
ney Turf Club —the hoary jest about the
horse which left his wife because she
was a little nag. Surely, I thought, such
lines as Montesquieu’s “The deteriora-
tion of a Government begins almost
always by the decay of its principles”
would have been more appropriate. Then
I noted the date in brackets (1825) and
realised that it wasn’t His Magnificence
McKell’s great contribution to the war
effort that was commemorated, but the
original club back in Governor Brisbane’s
day.

“O’Proof”: One of Vanguard’s most
important items of supply next year will
be the ship’s company’s issue of best
Jamaica rum. Rum is ruby-gold in the
Navy, and its issue is attended by due
ceremony. A procession, headed by the
captain of the hold and brought up by
a member of the ship’s police, marches
between-decks and halts above a steel
manhole. Keys are produced—after
signing by the aft-deck sentry —the man-
hole is' opened and there arises from the
metallic cave a rich, ripe, fruity smell of
rum 33 p.c. overproof. The captain of
the hold descends an iron ladder, and
with him goes an instrument marked on
the paybob’s books as “pump, rum.
copper.” There is a soft, squelchy clank-
ing sound as “pump, r.c.” does his stuff,
then the captain of the hold reappears,
in one hand the smaller barrel into which
the father barrel has given up the
day’s issue, and in the other, nodding and
smirking in alcoholic satiation, “pump,
rum, copper.” The procession heads
deckwards. Here, in a position of dignity
abreast the funnel, stands an enormous
barrel with “The King, God bless him!”
inscribed on it in six-inch brass letters.
The rum-cask in a British warship lives
in a state of shameless and perpetual
patriotism. The officer of the ritual doles
out the pungent ruby-red liquor as
though it were radium, until, so exact
is the measurement, the cask has to be
tilted for the lastcomers. The gro-g has
been served.

“Ex-C.G.”: The Comrades have been
desperately trying to work up a surge
of public sympathy for the Communist
M.L.A., Paterson, laid low in a dust-
up between police and Communists in
Brisbane and taken to hospital with
what is commonly called a cosh on the
conk. But the public—or even the
victim’s friends —are seldom sympathetic
about that.sort of thing. Anybody hurt
“Well have to use this until We get those house-linen coupons , dear."
in a brawl is generally regarded as merit-
ing it for having been in the thing at all
and is more likely to be laughed at by
his friends than wept over. Years ago I
came out of a fracas with sailors sport-
ing two gorgeous “stinkers” and a blood-
stained shirt. It caused vast amusement
in the circles which I then honored with
my society, earned me a scolding from
the girl-friend and seemed to inspire
several hitherto unregarded squirts with
a desire to emulate the sailors. As for
Paterson, the only comment I’ve heard
in a week is best summed up as “Serve
the so-and-so right.”
“Buster”: The rainbow seen by “Suvic”
around the shadow of his plane (B.
10/3/’4B) is a frequent sight in New
Guinea cloud-formations. The pheno-
menon is known as a “glory,” and is
caused by water droplets in the cloud
acting as prisms and refracting light into
its component colors. Dense cloud below
acts as a screen, enabling the effect to be
seen. The “glory” takes the form of a
ring because our field of vision is cone-
shaped and because the angles of re-
fraction of light in water and air restrict
our observance to a portion of the cone.
Strarige, though, that the circle became
smaller as “Suvic” moved further away.
My experience of the New Guinea area
has shown just the opposite.
* * * *
“Phoongyee” (South Africa): “Conda”
(B, 31/12/’47) remarks about the dupli-
cation of names in shipping. Reminds
me. In 1939 I went, as an invited guest,
on evolutions in H.M-S. Proteus, a
British submarine stationed at Hong
Kong. I made many friends, cement-
ing the comradeship that night at
the Gloucester. Then Hitler went mad,
and I returned to my country and went
into my fourth war. During 1940 pews
came through that the submarine Proteus
had been sunk in the Mediterranean with
all hands. With the best of intentions I
wrote to the Navy Office asking if So-and-
So and Such-and-Such were among
those lost. Then fireworks started. I
was haled to the local H.Q. and put
through a third-degree by a very enlarged
brasshat as to the reason for this query.
Was I a spy that I knew the movements
of H.M.’s subs.? Eventually I was told
that the Proteus which had been lost was
a Greek submarine; H.M.’s Proteus was
still sailing the Atlantic and doing her
job of work.

“W.P.T.”: N.S.W. is to celebrate the
centenary of public education in the State,
and while the little school still standing
at Parramatta can’t be truly associated
with the centenary, it really is the
oldest school still standing in Aus-
tralia. A little brick building built
by John Macarthur for Huon de
Kerillion, who was tutor for Mac-
arthur’s children, it is alongside Fir-
holm, which was built as' a home for
the tutor, and is only a few hundred
yards from Elizabeth Farm House, the
oldest building still standing in Australia.
The little school-building is in remark-
ably good condition and well worth pre-
serving as a relic of the days of early
education.

“Niloc”: Sabotage in Marmalade
FactoVy! U&der this heading London
“Times” repotted the arrest of Mieczy-
slaw Derwinski, trusted manager of the
State marmalade factory in Bydgoszcz,
Poland. “Economic sabotage,” the con-
viction which took him out of office, is
a poser. Possibly it is a reference to the
vast quantities of pumpkin-pulp and
orange-pips in contemporary marmalade ;
more likely it is due to a sudden realisa-
tion by the commissars that marmalade,
so typical of the capitalistic breakfast,
had been planting its sticky, bourgeois
sentiments among the locals. If the Byd-
goszcz State electric-toaster factory suf-
fers a purge in the near future we will
have the answer.
* * * *
“E. & O. E.”: In good Queen Vic-
toria’s latter days Kipling wrote the tragic
story of “The Man Who Was,” which
opens:
Let it be clearly understood that the Rus-
sian is a delightful person till he tucks in
his shirt. As an Oriental he is charming.
It is only when he insists on being treated
as the most Easterly of Western peoples in-
stead of the most Western of Easterns that
he becomes a racial anomaly extremely diffi-
cult to handle. The host never knows
which side of his nature is going to turn up
next.
The story is about an English officer who
fell into Russian hands at Sebastopol.
Because he annoyed a Russian he was
sent t<q Siberia, enslaved, tortured and
beaten*for 30 years, before he escaped
to reach his old regiment at Peshawar,
where he died. Victoria has gone and
her son and grandson have followed her.
The Czars, too, have gone, but the Rus-
sian has not changed. The story is com-
pletely up-to-date except that it concerns
the ill-treatment of only one man, instead
of the many, under the Soviets.

“Q.Q.”: Touching the congestion pro-
duced by the rage for academic learning
at the University of Melbourne. Pro-
fessors don’t seem to me to be of the
same fibre as they were in the Middle
Ages. A psychology lecturef lately
complained that he had to contend with
400 students. Abelard, the poet-philo-
sopher of the eleventh century, proudly
remarks in his celebrated letters to
Heloise that he has 3000.
* * * *
“Findy”: Yes, Army nicknames can
be an embarrassment (B. 17/3/’4B). A
few weeks ago I was walking along Pitt-
street, Sydney, one night with my wife
when I suddenly stepped aside to shake
hands with an old crony I hadn’t seen
since the end of the war, Mrs. Findy
walked on a few steps and then stopped to
gaze in a shop-window, expecting me to
bring the friend over to be introduced. She
waited in vain ; after a few minutes’ chat
I said cheerio to the bloke, walked over
to my wife and hustled her away. How
could I introduce him when the only
name I could bring to mind was one we
didn’t use to his face —Jughead?
* * * ♦
“Kurilla”: “Eve’s” par about the
noisy wool-sales (B. 11/2/’4B) jogged my
memory about a cove I know who is
working on appraisements in a wool-
brokers’ office. “The high prices for wool
are good-oh,” he told me. “The ready-
reckoners we work on are all worn out
at tithe pages round about pre-war prices,
but the pages for present rates are as good
as new.”
NOT “OFF COLOR.”
“The Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir John
Latham, and his colleague, Mr. Justice Williams,
telegraphed to Sydney ‘Morning Herald’ to stigma-
tise the report that they were ‘off color’ (after 28
days of Bank Grab dialectics) as entirely without
foundation.”
Tests for endurance on the fields of war
Have worn out many a combatant before
Today, and in the ring where hefty pugs
And wrestlers trade their punches and their hugs.
Strong men to sleep are all too often sent
By dreary verbiage in Parliament.
But Judges must be made of sterner stuff,
It’s not for them to mutter “Hold, enough!”
Or even to admit they’re tired and sick
Of ceaseless floods of turgid rhetoric.
K.Cs. may chafe and wilt beneath the stress
Of their antagonists’ longwindedness.
The Junior bar, who play the part of pawns
In chess, may openly indulge in yawns,
Or find a lot of solace to allay „
Boredom in fees that grow from day to day.
Not so the Bench, who needs must list intent
To every perspicacious argument
And take prompt steps to contradict reports
Of being “off color” — i.e., “out of sorts.”
“On all great subjects much remains to be
Said” was John Stuart Mill’s philosophy.
And if this Bank Grab biz, as I suppose,
May not unreasonably rank with those,
Seeing the barney where it has begun
And all that may occur before it’s done,
One wonders whether the judicial dons
Whose job will be to weigh the pros and cons
And on whose say-so the result depends
Won’t be a bit “off color” —ere it ends.

THE SERVICE MAN
PERCIVAL v. YAMASHITA.
The Battles for Singapore.
“Ek Dum”: Around the
second week in January, 1942,
as the British-Indian forces pre-
pared to defend Johore, the rela-
tive strengths were: East Sector,
British, one brigade group;
Japanese, one division with air-
borne troops and two reserve
divisions readily available in
Indo - China. West Sector,
British, equivalent of one strong
division; Japanese, two crack
divisions, plus two in reserve.
With the withdrawal into
Johore fighting entered a new
kind of theatre—more settled
than the north, much under
rubber, with a belt of jungle on
the east. The Muar and Batu
Pahat rivers were major
obstacles, crossable by ferry
only in the danger zone. In
Batu Pahat there were extensive
Japanese-owned estates.
Galleghan’s Ambush
The first action in the Johore
defence was in the placing of
the ambush which had been
agreed to at the conference of
commanders on January 14. The
27th Brigade, A.1.F., and the
Bth Indian Brigade were lodged
across road and rail, with the
2 /30th Battalion, A.LF., in the
ambush position west of Gemas.
The 22nd Indian Brigade Group
was similarly placed in depth
athwart the Malacca-Segamat-
road, with the 2nd Loyals, with-
drawn from Singapore garrison,
responsible for the defence of
Segamat, an important crossing-
place. Major-General Barstow
was the senior officer on this
front. The 2/30th was under
that fine fighting soldier, veteran
of World War I, Lieut.-Colonel
F, S. Galleghan. The forward
company covered 700 yards of
road east of the Gemencheh
River, three miles in front of
the main battalion position, con-
cealed in thick scrub along the
roadsides. At about 4 p.m. on
January 14 500 cyclists were in
the ambush and another 500
were seen approaching. Then the
bridge went up behind the
enemy. A hot fire burst from the
roadsides and 400 to 500 Japs
were killed and left tangled with
their bicycles before the com-
pany retired.
Next mprning about 10 a.m.
hostilities were renewed by the
main battalion. There was a
bonny day of scrapping and, for
a loss of under 70, the 2/30th
and its active commander could
lay claim to the scalps of the
best part of a battalion of Japs
and eight or nine tanks. It was
about the worst mauling the
enemy had had so far, and it had
been administered despite the
fact that, though gallant, the air
support had been like a patch-
work quilt with Wirraways,
Vildebeestes and Buffaloes doing
their best against enemy columns
and H.Q. As General Percival
remarks:
The ambush at Gemas provides an
excellent example of the success that
will often attend such tactics in jungle
country. But fresh and reasonably
well-trained troops are required, and
these in the Malayan campaign were
seldom available.
The next move in the cam-
paign was on the 600-yard wide
Muar River, unbridged be-
low the main north - south
road. The 45th Indian Brigade,
newly-arrived with a battery of
Australian Field Artillery, had
the defence of this area, disposed
with two battalions forward. A
tactical error was made in push-
ing a company of each battalion
across the river to harass and
delay the enemy.
Bombing had started at Muar
town on January 11. All
electricity and water employees
took to the timber, as did the
ferrymen. On the morning of
January 16 the Japs crossed and
made contact.
The 111 Indian Corps, sadly
depleted as it was but with the
newly-arrived 53 rd Brigade
under its orders, became respon-
sible at this stage for Westforce
communications. The Sixth
Royal Norfolks were given a de-
file to hold east of the dominat-
ing feature of Bukit Payong, 11
miles east of Yong Peng, with a
detachment at Parit Sulong
bridge five miles on. The Third
Cambridgeshires were at Batu
Pahat and the Fifth Royal Nor-
folks in reserve.
About 2 a.m. on January 16
Japs crossed the Muar again a
few miles upstream from the
town and established a road-
block two miles east of the town
about 9 a.m. Continuous fight-
ing went on all the afternoon.
The A.l.F.’s Heroic Battle
Early next day the 2/29th Bat-
talion, A.1.F., was moved from
Segamat to Baled to meet the
threat, which was especially
dangerous to Westforce’s com-
munications in the Yong Peng
area. If the enemy could reach
the road there all the Segamat
area would be cut off. The
2/19 Battalion, A.1.F., ordered
over from Jemalaung, was re-
lieved temporarily by the Fifth
Royal Norfolks.
Early on January 18 the 45th
Brigade and the 2/29th Bat-
talion, A.1.F., were strongly at-
tacked in their perimeter at
Bakri. The enemy tanks had a
mauling. Nine were knocked out
by Australian anti-tank guns and
tank-hunters. But the enemy cut
off the road between the fighting
force and Brigade H.Q. to the
east. The 2/19th, arriving in
time, restored the status quo.
But the enemy came back again
in strength in the evening, after
having landed a strong force on
the coast north of Batu Pahat.
The position now that the
two crack Jap divisions, the
Imperial Guards and the sth
Division, were in the front-line,
the former in the Muar area, the
latter on the main road —it was
specially trained in landing
operations. That evening bn
General Bennett’s advice with-
drawal behind the Segamat
River was decided on. General
Bennett retained Segamat com-
mand and Sir Lewis Heath took
over Muar front.
On the morning of January 19
Bakri communications were at-
tacked. At midday the detached
4/9th Jats, returning to the 45th
Brigade, were ambushed and lost
heavily. A bomb virtually wiped
out Brigade H.Q., the com-
mander of the fresh and un-
trained 53rd Brigade became re-
sponsible for the Bukit Payong-
Yong Peng area, and the 3/16th
Punjabis were added to this
force. The 45th Brigade was
ordered to withdraw west of
Yong Peng through the 53rd,
which was to hold a line from
the Parit Sulong bridge to Yong
Peng - Muar - Batu Pahat - road
junction.
Tragedy on the Muar
The Muar British forces, act-
ing under w.t. orders from
G.O.C. Westforce, to concen-
trate, were attacked on the even-
ing of January 19 on all sides
and suffered heavily. Early next
morning general withdrawals
started in seven company groups
through swampy land with many
blockages which had to be
cleared in the fiercest and
bloodiest fighting of the whole
campaign. It was nip and tuck
all the time. The Australians,
British and Indians, harassed on
all sides, charged again and
again with the bayonet against
ferocious detachments of the
Japanese Imperial Guards. They
pushed through to the Parit
Sulong bridge at 6 a.m. on Jan-
uary 21 to find it held by the
enemy. It was a tattered but
determined force. Early in the
fight Brigadier Duncan, of the
45th Indian Brigade, had been
killed while leading a bayonet-
charge, and his command de-
volved on Lieut.-Colonel Ander-
son, A.1.F., who for his leader-
ship and courage was' afterwards
awarded the Victoria Cross.
General Bennett was now
in command of the troops at
Yong Peng-Muar-road—all too
exhausted to be much use in
heavy fighting. A forlorn-hope
plan to reopen communications
with the Muar troops through
seven miles of bad country with
the 2nd Loyals was abandoned
for want of transport. That iso-
lated body, the core of it the
A.1.F., fought desperately to
clear the Parit Sulong bridge,
but the appearance of heavy
tanks in its rear—several were
bagged—put it in an ever-tight-
ening squeeze. It held on
through the night.
In the morning three aircraft
from Singapore dropped food
and medical supplies, but by \
9 a.m. there was nothing for it
but to destroy guns, vehicles and
heavy weapons, leave the
wounded behind with volunteers
and take to the bush to walk, if
possible, to Yong Peng.
About 550 A.I.F. and 400
Indian troops reached their des-
tinations. The wounded left be-
hind almost without exception
were massacred. The 45th Indian
Brigade had ceased to exist.
The brigade commander, every
battalion commander and
second-in-command and two of
the three adjutants had been
killed. Only one or two of the
surviving British officers had
more than a few months’ ser-
vice. The brigade “had never
been fit for employment in a
theatre of war” ; though there
was nothing wrong with its raw
material save that it was raw.
It paid “the price of our unpre-
paredness for war and over-
rapid expansion.”
The battle of Muar lasted six
days. It was a gallant episode
in which a small, untried force,
unsupported ‘by effective air
backing, held at bay a division
of crack and constantly rein-
forced Imperial Guards, and
saved the Segamat Force which,
including the A.1.F., otherwise
inevitably would have been
wiped out. It meanwhile had
been withdrawn the 27th
A.LF. Brigade by m.t. to Yong
Peng-road junction, the Ninth
Indian Division, one brigade
group to Labis, one to Kampong
Bahru. The 22nd Indian Brigade
went by m.t. to Kluang after
having ambushed the Japs very
successfully on the main road.
The Eighth Indian Brigade
fought as it fell back south of
Labis, savagely attacked by air-
craft whose onslaughts were be-
coming intensified.
The Crisis in Johore
The denial of the line of aero-
dromes in Central Johore, until
the full strength of the 18th
Division should arrive, had be-
come of primary importance.
The main crisis in Johore had
arrived, but it quickly resolved
itself. Brigadier Challen’s
Second Cambridgeshires and the
Fifth Royal Norfoiks with local
troops and artillery failed to
hold Batu Pahat. The Challen
force was cut off after a gallant
and futile attempt by scratch
armor to rescue - it. Its wounded
left when their comrades dis-
persed were not molested.
Retreat to the Island
The arrival of a Jap force
from the north in the Mersing
area made the fighting Malayan-
wide. With a Japanese convoy
off Endau, resistance to which
absorbed the last of the British
air-striking force, and led to a
naval battle in which H.M.A.S.
Vampire and H.M.S. Thanet
damaged a Jap destroyer and
Thanet was sunk. Retirement be-
came urgent. The advancing Jap
land forces were considerably
mauled before (22-23/1/’42) the
2/18th Battalion was withdrawn
to Nithsdale estate, where, on
the night of January 26-27, it and
its support caught and killed 300
Japs for a loss in killed, wounded
and missing of less than 100.
The troops then fell back
through the Jenalaung position.
General Percival received per-
mission to withdraw into Singa-
pore Island.
Next day the 22nd Indian
Brigade was caught in an am-

Argand made the revolutionary
discovery that a circular cotton wick,
with central draught and the flame
surrounded by a glass chimney,
increased the illuminating power
enormously. By 1860, petroleum
or kerosene had also displaced the

used.
Effective as kerosene lamps became, particularly with
the advent of the incandescent mantle, they were
superseded by the rapid development of the electric

Defence of Singapore
Singapore is 27 miles maxi-
mum east to west, 13 miles mini-
mum north to south. It held a
million people. Add a couple of
hundred thousand troops of both
sides, place a relentless enemy all
round and fill the skies with
enemy bombers which cannot
be effectively resisted, and some
idea will be gained of the prob-
lems Which beset General Per-
cival and his commanders.
There were heavy guns
a battery of 15-inchers with no
ammunition, a 9.2 in. battery
with 30 rounds per gun and
some six-inchers. Some guns
were ruled out of use because
of limited bearing.
The island was very difficult
to defend on the northern and
western shores. It was there a
mass of creeks and mangroves.
All that could be done was to
establish small defended
localities with mobile reserves
for support, and to cover in-
terstices against infiltration.
Three areas were constituted —
the north defended by 111 Indian
Corps under Sir Lewis Heath,
from Causeway to Changi; the
southern, defended by fortress
troops, fixed defences, two
Malay infantry brigades and the
Straits Settlement Volunteers
under Major - General Keith
Simmons ; the western area, in-
cluding Woodlands, Bukit Timath
village to, but not including, the
Jurong River, by the A.I.F. under
Major-General Gordon Bennett.
The 12th Indian Brigade—
what was left of it—formed the
reserve under Brigadier Paris,
Artillery was allotted with a de-
fensive free zone 200 yards in
front of forward defended
localities. Shortage of 25-
pounder ammunition restricted
normal harassing fire except
with special permission.
On February 5, before the Jap
attack, the Empress of Asia was
bombed as she arrived. Man-
power in her was saved, but all
weapons and equipment lost.
The Enemy Lands
At 1.30 p.m. on February 8
the enemy opened on the 22nd
A.I.F. Brigade and on the raw
and untrained 44th Indians with
a heavy bombardment. Casual-
ties, thanks to slit-trenches, were
not heavy. The 22nd Brigade,
A.1.F., was on a three-battalion,
16,000-yard front from the
Kranji to the Berih River,
backed by a neck of land
narrowing to 3000 yards where
the Kranji and Berih headwaters
almost come together. The
2/20th Battalion, A.1.F., with a
company of Dalforce, was on the
right over 8000 yards between
the Kranji and Sarimbun Island ;
the 2/18th Battalion, A.1.F.,
fortified by reinforcements since
its losses on the Muar, on the
left from Murai Point to the
Berih.
There was a m.g. company
along the front. The brigade
was covered by the A.F.A. with
30 heavy guns. Though he has
“no record of orders,” General
Percival says it appears that the
forward troops, if overrun, were
to fall back successively to com-
pany and battalion perimeter
positions.
The first landings took place
at 8.45 p.m. on February 8, and
very soon the whole front from
the right of the 2/20th to the
right of the 2/19th was being
attacked.
Jap boats were driven off at
the mouth of the Berih River.
The Japs crossed in special
armored craft (the later ones
were more vulnerable), each
carrying 40 to 50 men. About
13;000 crossed during the night
and 10,000 soon after dawn. The
attack was made in such a way
that it was certain preparations
had been made for’it long be-
fore war started.
Very heavy, in some cases
hand-to-hand, fighting started in
many localities. Some of the
Australian m.gs. fired till am-
munition was exhausted.
General Percival writes:
Unfortunately it appeared that
SOS calls for artillery support were
not answered until some time after
the attack started. This was due
partly to inadequacy of Verey-light
signals in that close country, partly
to the severing of cable communica-
tion by the enemy’s bombardment
and partly to failure to make full
use of w.t. When the artillery-fire
did, come down it was maintained,
within the limits of resources avail-
able, at a high level throughout the
night and must have done consider-
able damage.
There was also, he says, a
failure to make proper use of
beach searchlights for reasons
now impossible to ascertain.
Presently a wedge was
driven between the 2/18th and
2/19th Battalions, and about
midnight the three A.I.F. bat-
talions were ordered to withdraw.
The 2/18th was too closely
interlocked with the enemy to
disengage; the same applied to
the 2/19th on the left. Few of
either of these two battalions
reached their perimeter at Ama
Keng village. The 2/20th, with-
drawing at midnight to Ama
Keng, found it occupied by the
enemy.
General Percival relates:
The plan for the forward troops to
fall back to battalion perimeter posi-
tions was contrary to the policy laid
down by H.Q. Malaya Command
and, in my opinion, involved an
operation too difficult in the middle-
of-night battle which was being
fought fiercely at close quarters. As
a result there was much confusion and
disorganisation, groups of men be-
coming detached and lost in the close
country. Some were collected and
some made their way to Singapore
town.
The 22nd Brigade, A.1.F., “diu
not cease to exist—on the con-
trary it continued to fight well”
—and it would (in General Per-
cival’s opinion) “be very wrong
to judge the performance of the
A.I.F. by these stragglers, whose
own actions must be judged in
existing conditions. They were
not long-service men, and dis-
cipline in them was not deep-
rooted They had fougfit well
throughout a long night against
heavy odds and were ex-
hausted” :
This is the true picture and should
be judged on its merits. Active and
effective measures were quickly taken
by Malaya Command and A.I.F.
H.Q. to deal with the situation by
means of reinforced stragglers’ posts
and officers’ patrols in the town area.
The 2/29th was moved up to
Tengah with 22nd Brigade com-
mand for counter-attack, but
failed to recapture Tengah vil-
lage. The 12th Indian “Brigade”
—350 Argylls, of which 150 were
Royal Marines, and 400 Indians
—were moved into General
Bennett’s command. Fighting
continued fiercely, with some
lulls. At midnight, February
9-10, the commander of the
22nd Brigade, A.1.F., holding the
Causeway-Kranji sector, issued
orders to withdraw after its for-
ward battalions had been forced
back from the beaches.
This left open the position
overlooking the Causeway and
opened the left flank of the 11th
Indian Division. By the end of
the day Bukit Timah village in
the centre of the island was lost
after the inexperienced 44th
Indian Brigade had got out of
control and marched back four
miles without orders. “It was
not a question of fear or
cowardice.... rather of bewil-
derment in conditions strange to
these raw and untried troops.”
Surrender Comes
After the loss of reservoirs,
breakage of mains, lack of labor
which fled, shortage of gun
ammunition and the Jap com-
mand of sky and overwhelming
reserves made the ultimate de-
cision only a matter of time.
On February 14 Japs seemed
to be everywhere, and even
entered the Alexandra Military
Hospital, where they attacked
some of the staff and patients.
On the A.I.F. front there was
little activity, though there
was fighting on the 18th Division
front and in some other localised
areas. That day the Supreme
Commander, Lord Wa v e 11,
ordered:
In all places where sufficiency of
water exists for troops they must go
on fighting. Your gallant stand is
serving a purpose and must be con-
tinued to the limit of endurance.
On February 15, with the Japs,
now in overwhelming force,
closing in, and with only 24
hours’ water and a few days’
food available, all commanders
and civilian authorities at a con-
ference concurred unanimously
that a counter-attack to retake
the reservoirs was impracticable,
and decided to capitulate.

PERSONAL ITEMS
111-health has caused the retirement
from shipping activities of Thomas
Gordon, chairman and managing-director
of Birt and Co. and a director of a string
of companies connected with wharves and
shipping. During the war he was repre-
sentative in Australia, of the British
Ministry of Transport, chairman of the
Allied Consultative Shipping Council and
from 1942-45 was Commonwealth Direc-
tor of Shipping. Born at Ardrossan
(S.A.) 66 years ago, Gordon lived for
some years in Victoria, but most of his
adult life has been spent in Sydney
where, in addition to* his business in-
terests, he has been associated with many
charitable movements, among them the
Merchant Seamen’s Relief Fund, King
George’s Fund for Sailors, the Corps of
Commissionaires and the Deaf and Dumb
Society. He has been president of the
Belgian Chamber of Commerce in Sydney,
and in 1937 was presented with the Order
of Leopold. He was knighted in 1938.
News of the award of a D.S.O. reached
a Victorian farmer while he was working
on his property at Molyullah, near Ben-
alla. He is Air Vice-Marshal William
Dowling Bostock, C. 8., 0.8. E., Belgian
C. de G., etc. The award was granted,
the citation stated, for his planning and
preparation of the landings at Labuan
Island and Balikpapan and for his cour-
age and inspirational effect on all con-
cerned during the actual landings. He
was a foundation member of the
R.A.A.F., served in both wars and retired
in 1946 under the R.A.A.F. policy of
making space for younger men. He was
born in Sydney in 1892.
Lud Mayor Connelly dreams of Mel-
bourne being the site of the 1956
Olympiad and hopes to go to London in
May to push the claims of his city. His
Olympit Invitation Committee has pre-
pared elaborate brochures presenting in
word and picture the graces of Australia
and particularly what, the country has
to offer to sportsmen. Drawings of the
proposed Olympiad building and the pool
it is hoped to construct at a total cost of
a million will be included, along, no
doubt, with vistas of St. Kilda-road and
the Yarra and Melbourne’s Brighter
Sunday. If anybody can succeed Con-
nelly will; he’s always very much at home
with sportsmen. A fellow-Councillor and
one-time Olympic swimmer, Frank
Beaurepaire, will be in London at the
same time. Connelly’s third term as civic
head will expire while he is away,'but that
won’t matter, as hoary precedent ordains
that nobody can aspire to a fourth term
at the Melbourne Town Hall.
Australians have always been well to
the fore in the tin-dredging industry of
Malaya and Siam, and no family has
been more closely tied up with it than the
Miles clan. First in the field was Captain
E. T. Miles. He floated the pioneer com-
pany, Tongkah Harbor, in 1906, was its
first general manager and later managing-
director and was actively interested in
the industry until a few years before his
death in 1944. He was 95 at the finish,
and had seen five sons and four grandsons
engage in the search for tin. Best known
of the second generation is Arthur, still
in the game after 42 years. He stuck to
his post when the Japs came, and spent
2>\ years in Changi Camp. Since then, as
chairman of the Association of British
Mining Interests in Siam, he has had the
job of negotiating with Gov-
ernment in connection with war damage.
His brothers Leslie, Tom and Sydney are
still on the boards of tin shows ; Temple
Was also in the industry for a while.
When the Pacific war broke three sons
of Leslie and Temple’s son Paddy were
working in Siam. Three of them joined
the local volunteers, were captured and
slaved on the Thailand railway; the
fourth escaped to Australia, joined the
A.I.F, and served in the islands. They
are now back in the East carrying on the
family tradition that as long as there is
tin to be dredged there’ll be a Miles there
to dredge for it.
South-Australian Dr. Harry Wyatt
Wunderly, who directs the Common-
wealth fight against tuberculosis, backs
up, in conjunction with his wife, his life-
long interest in the prevention and cure
of that disease with a gift of £lB,OOO to
enable Australian medical graduates to
study chest affections overseas. Awards
of travelling scholarships tenable from
one to three years will be made by the
Royal College of Physicians, in consulta-
tion with the donors. In his own study
of t.b. Wunderly has made three trips
abroad ; he also served in various military
hospitals during the war.
The subject of Mcßeath’s sketch, Dr.
Lindsay Verrier, is medical officer in
Fiji, but at present he’s spending a six-
month vacation conducting research in
a laboratory next to Dr. Burnet’s at the
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Mel-
bourne. When his “holidav” is finished he

goes back to his far-flung laboratory in
the Pacific, extending from Taveuni a
thousand or more miles to the Gilbert
and Marshall Islands. Preposterous as it
sounds, the doctor knows 1 every man,
woman and child, and even every baby
newly arrived or coming on Taveuni
and the near-by islands. He has often
been credited with being a magician when
he has walked into a village and asked
the headman how Mrs. So-and-So is and
how her new infant is progressing.
During his 15 years’ sojourn he has
worked out an extraordinarily compre-
hensive card-index system which covers
the health and sickness, the births, deaths
and marriages of 27,000 people—and he
has done this in his spare time between
voyages in his launch supervising the
work of his hundreds of assistant g.ps., in-
telligent natives he has trained. On some
of the smaller islands there are com-
munities so isolated that they provide per-
fect opportunities for research into the
effects of the serums that Dr. Burnet is
producing; when he goes back Dr. Ver-
rier will continue to co-operate with that
noted scientist. Dr. Verrier spent three
months in captivity during the Jap occu-
pation, but escaped.
“Ek Dum’s” tribute:
Lately passed on, the third Earl of Strad-
broke, Governor of Victoria 1920-26, whose
tall, moustached, lovable figure was familiar to
more Australians than are generally closely
acquainted with State Governors. Both he and
his active and adventurous wife were undeterred
by hardship or difficulty from seeing as much
of this, continent as time would allow. They
even crossed Australia, south-north, by motor-
car in 1924 when the journey was a really
arduous feat. Coming of a long line of Suffolk
baronets, sportsmen and soldiers—one direct
ancestor had a doughty Peninsular record, and
a collateral was that famous sporting Admiral,
“the Blackstone of the Turf” —Lord Stradbroke
(85 at his death) led a busy life from his youth
onwards, devoting himself largely to the affairs
of the County of Suffolk and to the Royal Field
Artillery, with which he was associated for many
years. He served in World War I in France
and Palestine. In his later years he gave a
great deal of time to Masonry. He was Grand
Master of the United Grand Lodge of Victoria
during his Governorship and, from 1943 on-
wards, Grand Master of Mark Masons of
England and Past Grand Warden. His wife
was a daughter of Major-General- Keith Fraser,
member of the ancient Scottish Lovat family.
Anyone who saw her intrepidly dealing with
the perils of Central Australia could have
deduced her long military ancestry —her grand-
father, a Peninsular veteran, was on the staff
at Waterloo.
“Arunta”: There are other aboriginal
names in Who’s Who in Australia in
addition to the two mentioned in B.
10/3 / ’4B —at least three of them.
Douglas Nicholls, pastor of the Church
of Christ Aborigines’ Mission at Fitzroy
(Vic.), is one. He was born at Cummera-
gunja (N.S.W.) and has a notable record
as an athlete. In 1929, his best running
season, he won the Nyah Gift, the War-
racknabeal Gift and was fourth in the
Melbourne Thousand. He played foot-
ball for Northcote and Fitzroy and repre-
sented Victoria in inter-State matches.
Edwin Pareroultja, like Namatjira, is a
Hermannsburg native who took up paint-
ing at the encouragement of Rex Bat-
tarbee. At his first exhibition, held in
Melbourne, the whole 50 paintings were
sold in three days; some were bought for
the Melbourne National Gallery. Pare-
roultja is also a sprinter with a fair turn
of speed and has competed in the Stawell
Gift. The other dark Australian in
Who’s Who is Reginald Saunders, first
of his race to rise to commissioned rank
in the A.I.F. Son of an old Digger, he
served with the Sixth Division in Libya,
Greece, Crete and New Guinea and re-
ceived his pips in 1944. He is now with
Melbourne Tramways.
Retired after fighting Melbourne’s fires
for almost half a century, Robert Lewis
once drove horse-drawn fire-fighting
vehicles at full-speed down Collins-street.
In those days the Eastern Hill Brigade
(Melbourne’s biggest) boasted 70 horses.
He recalls the trained horses that would
leave the stalls and stand under the
harness when the alarm was given. Lewis
intends to live in the country, but reckons
it will be hard to resist going into action
when the local firebell rings.
Something of the subject’s boundless
energy has crept into Heth’s accompany-
ing sketch of Geoff Bingham ; an impres-
sion which is eminently just, for on his
few visits to The Bulletin he has seized
hands and wrung them with terrible force,
and while he was in Changi he wrote
something like half a dozen novels and
unlimited quantities of short-stories. This
mammoth output was brought into The
Bulletin for reading. One story,
“Laughing Gunner,” was immediately
published, the forerunner of many since
used by this paper. Bingham has had a
story selected for 1947 Coast to Coast,
has a novel being vetted by publishers—
and is still writing. His latest distinction
was military—the M.M., presented a few
weeks ago, for leading a bayonet attack
against the Japs in 1942. Geoff was a
sergeant in Eighth Division Sigs., and
bayoneting would, in an ordinary cam-
paign, have been outside his regular
FARMER-AUTHOR.
duties. For more orthodox work —laying
lines under heavy artillery fire—he col-
lected a “mention.” In his spare time a
farmer at Eungai (North Coast, N.S.W,),
he was born 29 years ago at Box Hill,
near Goulburn, and, like E. O. Schlunke,
was educated at Hurlstone Agricultural
High.
Commander G. C. Oldham, who takes
over from Commander Storey the Navy
Office job of Director of Intelligence,
graduated from Jervis Bay, served in the
battleship Ramillies and aircraft-carriers
Glorious and Eagle, and in 1937 qualified
at the Staff College, Greenwich. During
the war years he commanded H.M.A.S.
Swan and later was appointed to the
Shropshire as executive officer. In the
Leyte Gulf naval action he won the
D.S.C. for “skill, determination and cour-
age” and the Lingayen Gulf show brought
him a “mention.” In 1945 he became
secretary of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Committee. At present he is command-
ing Warramunga up Japan way. He is
a South Australian.
“Ornts”: Surely this must be a record?
At Blacktown (N.S.W.) show, in the Fine
Arts Section ranging from various types
of oil-paintings to charcoal-drawings,
there were 10 sections with a first and
second prize in each. C. F. Caldwell took
the lot.
In Melbourne to confer with Qantas
officials is J. W. S. Brancker, eastern
director of British Overseas Airways Cor-
poration. His rise as an aircraft Admini-
strator is an argument in favor of in-
herited tendencies. His father was Sir
Sefton Brancker, Director of Civil Avia-
tion, who surveyed the air route from
London to Singapore in 1929 and was
killed a year later when the airship RlOl
crashed in flames in France while on a
demonstration flight to India. Another
legacy from his father is his monocle.
After studying aviation engineering in
Switzerland he became an executive of
British airlines. He promises a fast and
a leisurely service from the Old Dart to
Australia in 34-seater planes.
Charles Booth, who succeeds Herbert
Gepp as managing-director of Aus-
tralian Paper Manufacturers, came
from England 25 years ago to take
charge of the Australian business of
Walmsleys, pulp- and paper-mill en-
gineers. He had served in France with
the Royal Engineers and put in four years
with Armstrong Whitworth in Newcastle-
on-Tyne. Six years ago A.P.M. called
him in as a consultant. A seat on the
board followed, and in 1945 he became
assistant managing-director. Herbert
Gepp’s career has been crammed with
hard work and public service. Forty-odd
years ago he was managing an explosives
concern in Melbourne. Then he went to
Broken Hill, joined De Bavay’s, saw it
grow into Amalgamated Zinc and
became its general manager. The Com-
monwealth Government sent him on a
mission to America in 1915, after which
he became g.m. of Electrolytic Zinc. In
1926 he was appointed chairman of the
Commonwealth Development and Migra-
tion Commission and during the next few
years he served on several Royal Com-
missions, directed an aerial survey of
North Australia, found time to write a
batch of books on questions of national
interest and, during the war years, was
chairman of the Commonwealth Central
Cargo Committee, Seventy last Sep-
tember, he has been managing-director
of Australian Paper Manufacturers since
1936. He hands over the reins on his
return from abroad next month, but will
retain his seat on the board.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 74, Alfred Christian Carlsen
Holtz, general manager of The “Argus” and
“Australasian” from 1920-36. He represented
Australian newspapers at the international press
conference in Geneva in 1927 and was chair-
man of the Australian Newspaper Conference
for many years.
In Adelaide, at 69, Stephen Robert Delmont,
founder of a 44-year-old process-engraving
business. He was former Federal president or
the Master Process Engravers’ Association, and
a member of the S.A. Royal Yacht Squadron.
At Kirkcaldy (S.A.), at 77, Canon Thomas
Hugh Frewin, who retired in 1940 after 45
years in the Anglican priesthood. The second
M.A. to graduate at Adelaide University, he
was ordained in Durham (Eng.) in 1895, be-
came curate at Silksworth, and returned to
S.A. in 1898. He was honorary numismatist
at Adelaide University and a member of the
committee of the Royal Blind Institution.
In Adelaide, at 48, Dr. Leon Opit, former
president, treasurer and trustee of the Adelaide
Hebrew Congregation. A graduate of Sydney
University, he practised at Mile End (S.A.)
prior to doing post-graduate work in America
in 1939. Since his return to S.A. he had
specialised in diseases of the heart.
In Swan water West, near St. Arnaud (Vic.),
at 75, Edwin G. Bath, member for the Nelson
Province in the Victorian Legislative Council
for 15 years and founder of' the Pleasant Side
Corriedale sheep stud. A well-known exhibitor
of sheep, cattle and horses, he was a former
president of the Kara Kara Shire Council.
In Corryong (Vic.), at 44, Richard Henry
Matthey, a member of the Victorian Police
Force for a quarter of a century. He won the
police valor badge in 1942 when he attacked
an armed man who had been involved m a
shooting affray.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
On Saturday women tossed a coin for
it, and thereby decided whether it would
be the races or the show. A few man-
aged to contrive both. Women at Rand-
wick flashed bright colors under a leaden
sky—all the new rich reds were there,
and the deep blues. Coq and pheasant
feathers put that cap-over-the-windmill
suggestion into millinery, utterly belied,
as usual, by a pin .with authority, no
matter how ornamental-looking. How-
ever, the real Easter Parade of clothes
is reserved for next Saturday. See you
behind the wire-netting, then!
You could pretend you were a V.A.,
and take Persia Porter’s Red Cross bus
to the showground last Saturday, or try
to get a taxi and finally climb into a
tram. The tram made royal progress—
Easter Show progress—through
the city ways, ending with a caracole be-
fore the R.A.S. turnstiles. There were
milling thousands there ahead of you,
and the grey day was heavy with the
smell of fish and chips. If any perfume-
maker of the future wishes to cause
Easter-time nostalgia among exiled Syd-
neyites, let him distill that subtle, oily, per-
meating scent. Then there were children,
horses, Aberdeen Angus, and, of course,
the Rupert Wilson’s of Oberon. Himself
will be busy not only with the beasties
but with the woodchopping this year.
Then there was Mrs. J. Patterson, of
Port Kembla, and her company of girl
helpers, tucked away literally beneath the
marrows, the pumpkins and the grammas.
Their workshop is below the high back
of the South Coast and Tablelands dis-
play. They’ll make your mouth water
with their show of preserves ; perfect and
peerless pears, stalk and all, pasnip daffo-
dil, carrot cups. At the Central Coast and
Tablelands fastness next door was Mrs.
S. Clark and her helpers making an orna-
mental door for the display. This was a
slow and meticulous business of corn-
stalks and grains of corn. Showing
Palamino polo ponies comes Linda
Desailly from Dandenong, Vic. Gillian
Ashton and Sarah Hordern were young
entrants in the equitation test. Miss R.
Emery, Mrs. Tom Kelly and Mrs. M.
Hoad were the prizewinners.
Whether you firmly declare there’s
“nothing in it,” or belong to the “There
are more things in Heaven and earth”
school, the sight of hundreds of humans
swaying and gently tottering back and
forth at the bidding of Enrico Ceccarelli,
was equally intriguing. Enrico is a
hypnotist. There seems little doubt of
it. He called up to the stage from the
Royal audience the other afternoon a
mixed company and had them shivering
with the cold, playing imaginary violins
and pianos. The audience at the private
performance was sprinkled with business-
men, theatre bigwigs, students, news-
papermen and women and a few men
and women dressed for going on to
dinner-parties. Enrico, who has just
arrived from London, served for two
years with E.N.S.A., and entertained
thousands of United Nations’ troops.
When some historian of the future
writes the history of the famous women
of our times no one will have a higher
place in it than Helen Keller. Miss
Keller, now in her sixties, became blind
and deaf in babyhood as the result of
illness. But her indomitable spirit has
conquered all disabilities, and now she
is accepted as one of the world’s writers
and musicians. This American heroine
is due to arrive in Sydney on March £9,
and from then onwards she will be prin-
cipal character in a programme equal to if
not overtopping that of Eleanor Roose-
velt’s.
The usual silver-lettered invitations are
out for the marriage of Margaret Fyvie
Watt and Arthur MacKinnon, of Tas-
mania. Margaret’s parents are the Fyvie
Watts, of Killara. But the ceremony will
be in St. Mark’s at Darling Point, and the
late-afternoon reception will be held in the
Royal Sydney Golf Club, Rose Bay.
Mrs. Tom Bowling, of Woodstock, Long-
ford, Tasmania, will be matron-of-honor.
The 1948 Easter Egg is simmering, and
there’s a grand handout of spoons to
crack it with. If you’re the sort of woman
this Letter thinks you are, your spoon
will be the new look (but not that terribly
smug “new-rich” look), complete with
new furs. If you have gone slow in the
matter of sample-bags at the Show, you
can, with a clear conscience, wrap your-
self about in broadtail for £139
10s. Or what about a cosy little
pelerine, that Queen Vicky might
have worn, ticketed at a mere £350.
h you think that’s too big a shock for
husband’s overdraft what about three
yards of blue-fox stole at one hundred and
ninety guineas?
And don’t think you can make your
old furs do. All the coats are fuller and
longer. Sleeves suggest Chinese lanterns
when worn full-length, but the really
smart thing is to wear them pushed up.
Collars are back, some are small and
Peter Pan-ish, others get closer to the
ear-line. Fox, in all its variations, will be
seen where’er you walk. Mink and
Kolinsky and Persian lamb are made
into the brisk little jacket coatees with
their flared basques, or the longer coats
with their ripple-back effects. You pay
the money and take your choice.
The three-day Red Cross Branch con-
ference will open at the Assembly Hall
on March 31. It is expected that the
800 branches will each send a delegate—
already 600 have accepted the invitation
to do so. Among the speakers will be
Dr. Rhodes Hambridge, the society’s t.b.
specialist, vice-president of the society
and chairman of social services committee
George Patterson, and Margaret Whale,
not long back from England, where she
made an intensive study of mental health.
One of the matters on the agenda paper
which will get the wholehearted support
of all women is the collecting and sending
to England of all surplus household fat.
The conference will be under the direction
of Mrs. G. R. Strachan, honorary
director of Red Cross Branches.
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital takes this
business of building-up and restoring
health to the community very seriously.
That is why it has just appointed Margaret
Looker as matron of its vast and ever-
growing health colony. Miss Looker,
after six years of war service—she left
Australia with the first convoy—was
awarded a Florence Nightingale Inter-
national Foundation Scholarship by the
Australian Red Cross, This entitled the
holder to a year of study at the Royal
College of Nurses in London and a year
of field work among the hospitals
throughout England. Margaret, of
course, having plucked her diploma from
the Royal - College of Nurses, made the
most of the opportunities for widening
her experience.
These Florence Nightingale scholar-
ships were thought of as far back as 1912.
At an International Conference of
Nurses a distinguished Englishwoman put
forward the idea as a means of keeping
members of the profession in touch with
the most up-to-date movements in science
and medicine in the great hospitals of the
world. Years later, when the Memorial
Scholarships were founded, the Red
Cross of each country provided the funds
for this course. The all - round
qualities of the chosen nurses are
considered, and particularly those which
will, on her return to her own country,
help each scholarship-holder to be a
leader in matters pertaining to her pro-
fession, Nurses from Poland and Nor-
way, Switzerland, China, Maoriland and
other lands reap the benefits of these
scholarships, and in turn pass them on to
suffering humanity. These Florence
Nightingale Memorial Scholarships have
proved their value. Their number and
scope should be increased with the pas-
sing years. Dorothy Welding photo.
A R.A.D. Scholarship to Sadler’s
Wells means more than tuition in danc-
ing. Every student’s education must be
up to leaving certificate —those who have
not acquired this before have to take the
necessary studies. Arnold Haskell, who
is Director of Education, sees to that.
Judith Stout (known in London as Judith
Ker) and Sydney girl Gwen Pike, having
passed this exam, in Sydney, are not re-
quired to attend these classes. They may
visit museums, go to such plays and con-
certs of which A.H. approves, and always
they are required to write an essay on
what they have seen or heard.
From Melbourne
Pretty girls wearing “Easter bonnets”
fashioned of colored cellophane sold
sweets, programmes, cigarettes and
Easter eggs at the parade of fashions held
at Admiralty House to aid the Royal
Melbourne Hospital Centenary Appeal
Lady Herring, wearing a smart navy
jacket-suit and a matching hat, introduced
Evie Hayes, who opened the parade,
Evie was clad in a short-jacketed wool
suit of hunter’s-green; her flat velvet
beret was in two tones —hunter’s-green
and lime. Reta Findlay, of Georges, who
produced the show, matched her high-
crowned beret with a draped frock of
cocoa-brown crepe. Sitting with Mrs.
W. L. Russell Clarke, president of the
Hospital Appeal Entertainments Com-
mittee, were the Governor’s sister, Mrs.
J. O. Haselden, and Penelope Nettlefold.
Mrs. Henry Searby and Mrs. Roy
Chambers, both ardent workers for the
hospital, were there. Among the smartest
fashions displayed were the English tweed
suits with matching topcoats. There
was no “new look” about them, for
lengths were at least Min. from the
ground. Most suitable for this city’s
climate were the tweed coats with their
attached hoods. Fur was used with dis-
cretion to trim smart coats and suits.
One black coat with snug-fitting hood and
collar of leopard skin, was the tops in
smartness. Evening-gowns were either
short and bouffant or long and form-
fitting.
Glenda Raymond, born Glenda Ryan
at Kerang 24 years ago, was a bank clerk
until five years ago, when she decided
on singing as a career. Her singing of
the role of Melba in the radio play of
the diva’s life opened the floodgates for
her, and since then she has been the
singing star of Music for the People in
the Botanic Gardens and in Opera for the
People. Glenda, who is shy, petite and
has big brown eyes, leaves soon for
London, Paris and Rome to see much
and learn more of her chosen art. Photo,

Autumn shades were well in evidence
among racegoers at Moonee Valley on
Saturday reds and greys rubbed
shoulders with soft mist-blues, linden-
greens and frappe limes. The bright
brick-red wool coat worn by Mrs. A. L.
Walters had a fitted back with a slightly-
flared skirt and was double-breasted ; a
black felt hat trimmed with black coq-
feathers at one side lent contrast. Mrs.
Bill Seymour’s tailored grey suit was wofn
with a small upturned grey felt hat. With
her grey suit Mrs. E. Phillips wore a
matching felt hat ' embellished with
pheasant-feathers. A grey suit, mist-blue
crepe blouse, a grey felt hat trimmed with
grey-and-blue-checked taffeta ribbons was
Margaret Viney’s choice.
Mrs. Samuel Fletcher, wife of the U.S.
Consul-General, wore a tailored frock of
oyster-grey wool crepe and small black
wool crepe hat with drapery at the back.
Mrs. T. Lewis’s nigger-brown wool
romaine jacket suit featured a full-flared
skirt and a band of mink outlining the
yoke and shoulders of the jacket; her
small pillbox hat was olive-green. Kath-
leen Syme chose a navy outfit and an up-
turned navy straw hat trimmed with
feather quills speckled with red. Mrs.
Neate’s tailored black coat was Persian-
lamb-trimmed, her hat decorated with
large black ospreys. Mrs. Les Sangster
favored a jacket suit in linden-green
angora and a small brown grosgrain-
ribbon hat bunched with green feathers.
With Mrs. A. A. Lord, who wore silver-
foxes with her smart cyclamen-and-blue
check tweed suit and small cyclamen hat,
was Mrs. A. Dalton, Ballarat, in black
with a small black hat relieved with blue
taffeta ribbon. Floral gaiety was favored
by Mrs. W. K. Burnside, but there was
compensating sobriety in a feather-
trimmed green felt hat. Frappe-lime and
brown checks formed the smart jacket Ivy
Parker wore with her brown skirt and
wide-brimmed brown feather-trimmed
hat. Winsome Dane, just returned from
England, chose a navy wool jacket-suit
and small beret. With her was Pat
Green, smartly tailored in grey tweeds.
Although every designer conforms to
basic principles, it needs the inspired
touch to make the design original.
There were many such notes at
the La Petite fashion parade which
was held in the Australia’s Venetian
Court, and which helped along the funds
of the Children’s Hospital. An ice-blue
French angora coat, lined with cyclamen
silk, was worn over a cyclamen-and-blus
pure silk floral frock. French angora suits
revealed filmy lace blouses when the
jackets were removed, and a pale-pink
duchesse-satin evening gown was allied
with black French lace to make an allur-
ing ball gown. Very attractive was the
black eyeletted and embroidered pure
silk faille floating over pale-pink satin to
make a ballerina frock. Many smartly-
gowned women listened to Lady Mur-
doch, who opened the parade. The Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard Heinze, wore a
deep midnight-blue shot taffeta gown
under a full-length fur coat, Penelope
Nettlefold’s black net evening gown was
embroidered with bluebirds. Mrs. Edgar
Rouse, a member of the Children’s Hos-
pital committee, wore with a short match-
ing jacket an ice-blue gown heavily em-
broidered with silver sequins. Her
daughter, Julia Mary, chose a gown of
pastel-pink crepe. Mrs. John Starke’s
white gown was patterned in tropical
pink and blue flowers and large green
leaves. Mrs. Alec Finlay’s black satin
gown had a deep band of white satin,
lavishly gold-trimmed, outlining the off-
the-shoulder bodice. A black velvet
neckband in which an antique gold
brooch was pinned completed a neat
picture. Mrs. Jimmy Moss, gowned in
silver-grey crepe, sparkling with silver
sequins, was with her prospective
daughter-in-law, Norma Kelly.
The Toorak Presbyterian Church was
the venue when Margaret Marion, only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Sim-
son, of Quirindi (N.S.W.), exchanged
vows with John Wilson, second son of
Mr, and Mrs. Charles Kelly, of Cara-
mut. The bride wore a beautiful gown
of lustrous creamy satin cut on simple
lines with long sleeves and heartshaped
neckline, at the front of which she pinned
an old pearl brooch which belonged to
her great-grandmother. Over it fell a
veil of Limerick lace caught at either
side of the head with gardenias, matching
her bouquet. Malachite-green moire
frocks, with slightly-wired skirts and
draped bodices, were worn by the three
bridesmaids, Pauline Kelly, the bride-
groom's sister, Marion Simson, cousin of
the bride, and Judy McDonald. Their
matching hats of horsehair straw had a
large crimson rose tucked under one side
of the brim to match their bouquets. The
’groom’s brother James was best man,
and his brother Colin and the bride’s
brother John were groomsmen. At the
reception, held at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Russell Grimwade, were many coun-
try and inter-State guests. The bride’s
mother chose a ciel-blue frock and a
tulle hat trimmed with matching blue
feathers. Mrs. Kelly wore the new
“linden green” shade. Mrs. Grimwade
added a black tulle hat to her primrose,
grey-and-white patterned frock.
Shirley, only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. H. W. Robb, of Caulfield, has an-
nounced her engagement to Arthur,
second son of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur W.
Coles, of Toorak. Shirley is on the staff
of the University Guidance Bureau.
Arthur, an old Geelong College boy,
served in the R.A.A.F., and is now doing
his second year commerce course at the
Uni. Engagement was celebrated with a
cocktail-party given by Shirley’s parents.
Dr. Violet Robertson, one of the first
police Judges of the City of Glasgow,
who is also a Doctor of Law, has come
here at the invitation of the British
Council, and will study health problems
and social services. Dr. Robertson, who
is also the “mother” of the Glasgow
Council, to which she was elected in 1921,
believes that more women should stand
for councils, for their knowledge of child-
welfare and all its problems would be
very valuable to the public interest. When
Dr. Robertson is in Court she wears a
black robe, ermine-trimmed, and a three-
cornered hat. Judges also wear a gold
chain engraved with the city’s coat-of-arms.
The visitor urged that this country
send~ more food parcels to the United
Kingdom, for the food situation was
affecting the morale of the people. Dr.
Robertson visited Australia 28 years ago.
In his exhibition of theatre decor and
designs at the Velasquez Galleries War-
wick Armstrong has included the designs
for the Theatre Guild’s presentation
of “Twelfth Night” on April 1. Evie
Hayes, who opened the show, wore a
jacket suit, the jacket of which featured
the nipped-in waistline; the skirt was
pleated. June Clyne, who made some of
the costumes for the production, was on
hand wearing a saucy brow® hat
trimmed with brown and cream taffeta
ribbon and a long brown crepe frock with
pleating at the hemline.

million ords. for cash and received
a quarter of a million in bonus scrip in
1934.
For the first five years, when
money was wanted for development, the
parent gave generous financial assistance
and took nothing out of the business by
way of divs. However, the laying of
solid financial and technical foundations
has yielded good harvests. Divs. have
averaged 18.3 p.c. over the last 16 years,
the average for the last three of them
being 34.5 p.c. But exchange has taken
some of the gilt off the gingerbread.
Since the end of the war demand has
been running well ahead of production
in the rubber-manufacturing industry,
which covers a wide range of custom,
and research is constantly expanding
market scope. On the tyre and tube
side, which accounts for the bulk of the
co.’s turnover, the following comparison
of motor-vehicle registrations in Australia
(service vehicles excluded) is a pointer
to what has happened:

The shoeing of new vehicles has fallen
short of early anticipations, owing to, the
dollar famine and other problems; but
demand is gathering momentum, and
should get a fillip when the all-Australian
car being turned out by G.M.-H. comes
on to the market about the end of this,
year. Meanwhile the call for tyre re-
placements has been exceptional
privately-owned cars long continued in
restricted use on patched shoes.
Government control of purchase and
use of rubber ceased about 18 months ago,
the raw stuff has come forward in grow-
ing volume, while American synthetic has
kept the price down. Main problem has
been to get adequate supplies of skilled
labor and of materials, including carbon-
black, which is a dollar commodity. The
leap of £86,316 in last year’s net earnings
was more than covered by a reduction
of £96,000 in provision for taxation
(£225,000), thanks to abolition of War-
time (Co.) Tax. There was little change
in allowance for depreciation (£75,582,
down £244). The £300,683 of profit
covered pref. requirements and 36.8 p.c.
on ord. capital, as against 25.3, 13.4, 17.5,
16.2, 14.7 and 14.6 p.c. back to 1941.
And £99,430 of reserves “over-provided
in previous years” was brought from
hiding and put in the window, making a
total of £320,214 so disclosed over the
last five years. The div. was raised from
26.4 p.c. to 36.8 p.c.

It is hoped to instal more manufacturing
equipment during the current term, and
so help cushion the effects of the 40-hour
week. Stocks (up £192,035) catch the
eye, but with rubber at its present price
they are a source of less anxiety than
they were in some pre-war years.

This is now mainly a holding co., and
the market expresses its confidence in the
management by pricing the f.-p. pound
share at 45s.—they had touched 475, 6d.
earlier this year. The return at 455. is
3.5 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div, basis, with
prospects that appear more encouraging
in the long- than in the short-run. Net
tangible cover is visibly 31s. lOd. per
share.
The business began to put on weight
after World War I and developed rapidly
following slump in the early 1930’5. Of
the £775,000 of paid capital, £473,333,
which brought with it £83,875 of share
premiums, was gathered during the half-
dozen years to close of accounts in 1939.
This new share and premium money, and
more besides, was used to establish
W. R. Carpenter (Overseas Shipping),
Ltd., operating between New Guinea and
U.K.; form W. R. Carpenter (London),
Ltd., to handle the business of the group
at that end; strengthen the aerial section
of the organisation; increase its island
coastal-shipping fleet; take over the busi-
ness of On Chong and Co., Gilbert
Islands and Coconut Products, Ltd.;
buy all the 100,000 £1 prefs. in W. R.
Carpenter (Solomon Islands), Ltd., mak-
ing this a wholly-owned subsidiary ; pur-
chase the ords. in Brown and Joske, Fiji—
now W. R. Carpenter (Fiji), Ltd.; take
over hotels at Wau and Bulolo on the
New Guinea Goldfields; and set up
Southern Pacific Insurance, Ltd., thus
keeping profit on a good volume of in-
surance business in the family. Early in
the war W. R. Carpenter (Canada), Ltd.,
was formed in Vancouver to crush copra
for the Canadian oil market. Since the
end of hostilities the parent’s interests in
New Guinea have been passed to W. R.
Carpenter (New Guinea), Ltd., registered
in Rabaul.
Meanwhile, the Jap invasion inter-
rupted a flow of 10 p.c, divs.; but the
co.’s Fiji, insurance, shipping and other
interests kept the pot boiling, and a steady
5 p.c. was paid for the five years to 1946,
followed by 1\ p.c. last term, whet) the
final was at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a. The
Fiji co., which recently threw off a sub-
sidiary of its own (Island Industries, Ltd.)
to mill copra and oil-seeds, has paid a
steady 12| p.c. for the last five years, and
the insurance co. 8 p.c. in 1946 and 1947
and 7 p.c. for six years before that. The
curtain is kept drawn over the figures of
the other operating cos.
Owing to inadequate and irregular
shipping, shortage of materials and sup-
plies, and the one-year contract and other
things connected with native labor, re-
habilitation in former war combat zones
remains a slow business, as the following
comparison of New Guinea trade figures
shows:
1939-40. 1946-47.
Merchandise exports .. £3,247,585 £415,125
Gold exports . . .. 2,797,226 179,000
Imports 962,126 1,151,841
The plight of the Solomon and Gilbert
Island groups is even worse than in New
Guinea, where the position has been
aggravated by Mr. Ward’s socialistic pro-
posals and by the Federal Government’s
policy in the purchase of copra. It pays
planters £35 10s. a ton and sells the
stuff in Sydney at about £5O a ton. Of
the difference £6 17s. 6d. goes to a Gov-
ernment-controlled “reserve and stabi-
lisation fund.” Exactly what is to be done
with this fund, and who is entitled to the
money and upon what terms and condi-
tions, has never been clearly explained.
In Fiji the price (in store) is £3B (Fiji)
a ton, approximately £A43; and in
Ceylon and Malaya about £6O (stg.) a
ton. As trading activity in the islands re-
covers earning power of the co.’s interests
there should benefit. All trade accounts
considered irrecoverable have been
written off, and assets are subject to war-
damage claims (amount not stated).
Financially and otherwise the co. is
ready to take prompt advantage of any
opportunity that offers:

Last year’s growth in investments (up
£414,878) was due partly to formation
of the New Guinea subsidiary and partly
to disclosure of £120,000 of contingency
reserves. The improvement in the more
or less liquid surplus (£1,272,014) was
£279,042, due partly to disclosure of
the inner reserves just mentioned.

The table shows 1947 as a bumper year
for this large and progressive co-opera-
tive, though it is not primarily concerned
with winning profits from its dealings
with shareholder-clients. So fine are its
profit-margins that last year’s earnings
represented less than 1 p.c. on the
record turnover of £44 million. More
than half these earnings was then returned
to members (as rebates) in proportion to
their business with the company. Part
of the remainder was used to recompense
them (with a 4i p.c. dividend) on the
basis of their capital contributions. This
is a prudent arrangement, as many
farmers have invested more than
their strict quota of capital and
the company is anxious to encourage
larger contributions from all. Whilst the
minimum subscription for membership is
only £lO, the full business of an average
producer employs something like £250 of
the co-operative’s funds.
Last year’s drive for extra capital suc-
ceeded in raising the total by nearly one-
third. That is still insufficient; cash
balances had to be drawn upon for a
further £51,155 last term to meet expand-
ing business, whilst creditors (this item
includes £105,569 in overdrafts and
£41,700 mortgages in the following table)
were owed £101,106 more than in 1946:

All departments expanded last year, in
line with the general agricultural
prosperity made possible by good
harvests and an acute world demand
for primary products. The co.’s wool
turnover rose by £500,000, mainly because
of higher prices. The livestock handled
was better both in quantity and price,
and the board developed a promising new
export market in Singapore. The stock-
foods factory increased its output, and
better turnovers were recorded in the
farm machinery, fertiliser, fruit packing,
land agency and insurance sections.
Wheat business was still confined to
not very remunerative agency work on
behalf of the official Marketing Board.
The new international wheat-price pro-
posals indicate that the co. will keep
this subsidiary role for some time yet,
but indirectly it will benefit from the
general stability of the industry. Last
year’s record average siding price of 6s.
2jd. to growers is likely to be exceeded
this season, and the harvest will certainly
prove greater. The co. also continues
to carry out agency work for the official
authorities controlling barley, oats, jute,
dried fruits and potatoes.
An amendment to the articles of associ-
ation last month provides for a gradual
transformation of the present board of
seven members until by 1951 it will com-
prise five “general” directors and 16
“zone” directors, the latter representing
all sections of the State. An earlier
amendment in 1947 authorised the board
to pay “reasonable dividends” to share-
holders during times of agricultural de-
pression. Divs. were passed over for
11 years after the 1929 slump to allow
the co. to wipe off debts owed by clients.
Both these measures should enhance
the attraction of the co-operative’s shares
to agriculturists in the West. One method
of raising the extra funds required would
have been to charge higher rates for the
various services and pass the surplus into
reserves, but the board has calculated
that, with company-tax at its present level,
this would not be to the members’ best
advantage. Net tangible asset backing
of the shares, on last balance-sheet figures,
is 275. 3d. each.
Lake View and Star, Ltd.
' This London-controlled co. (paid
capital* £560,000 in 4s. shares) is Aus-
tralia’s biggest gold - producer. The
mine is at the southern end of the Kal-
goorlie Golden Mile (W.A.), and is
serviced by four main shafts —Ivanhoe,
3628 ft.; Chaffers, 3756 ft.; Lake View,
2347 ft.; Associated, 2283 ft. —and a
57,000-ton-a-month flotation plant. There
is also a retreatment plant handling
accumulated residues. The lodes are
numerous and scattered, and prospecting
is complicated by intersection of the ore-
bodies and by pre- and post-lode fault-
ing.
War interrupted development and treat-
ment, but the co. is getting into its stride
again, to the benefit of earnings, out of
which costs take a much bigger bite

There was little change in the
average number of men em-
ployed (852 as against 845 in
1946), and labor turnover was
heavy; but fewer hands were
employed on reconditioning and
more in the slopes. Gold ex-
traction was 90.74 p.c. The re-

reflects the extra throughput and
increased plant efficiency, fol-
lowing alterations to secondary

vestments Pty., which held them
for De Bernales Family Trust in
Westralia. Boulder Persever-
ance is said to have made “an
attractive offer” for this parcel
last year. Great Boulder lies
between Perseverance and Lake
View and Star on the Kalgoorlie
Golden Mile (W.A.). The co.
paid 12j p.c. last year. Ore
reserves' at the end 1946 were
2,448,800 tons, averaging s.4dwt.
Recent developments on the
3100 ft. level exposed ore show-
ing telluride and free gold.
There has been talk recently of
another effort to remove the co.’s
domicile from London to Aus-
tralia. The scrip sold in Adel-
aide last week at 9s. lid.
London quotes have been

Western Mining Corp. has
added the Bonnievale group of
mines to its Coolgardie Gold
options. Bonnievale was an
early-day failure, but was not
worth half as much then as it
is now. Still, the rise in costs
has almost equalled, and in some
cases exceeded, the rise in the
price of gold.

Efforts are being made to re-
vive tin production at Green-
bushes, about 100 miles south of
Perth, and the Westralian Gov-
ernment has promised help. The
field’s past production is
valued at £1,000,000. A lot more
tin, it is claimed, awaits extrac-
tion, and there is some tantalite,
too. Prospecting and treatment
are expensive, which makes the
field a company’s rather than a
gouger’s proposition.

Westralian goldmining cos.’
dividend - total for 1947 was
£894,085 compared with
£713,926 in 1946. Production
has kicked off badly this year.
For the first two months the
total was 90430 z. less than that
for the corresponding period of
1947. Decrease is mainly attri-
buted to fewer prospectors’
crushings and the absence of
some small cos. from the list.

Under the Westralian Coal
Miners’ Welfare Act, which
operates from March 1, the
Collie cos. will pay a royalty of
l-|d. a ton on all coal mined
to establish a fund for the pro-
vision of miners’ amenities. The
fund will be administered by a
board for the improvement of
the physical, cultural and social
wellbeing of the miners.

RAAF 1.62.2 a,
SUNDRY SHOWS
Sydney Show.
The Show, of course, is noth-
ing like it used to be when we
were kids. Remember? The
freshly-painted machinery, the
rich and wonderful smell of
evepdhing from cattle to chips
frying in deep fat, snorts and
bellowings and barkings, shout-
ing sideshowmen, blare of
merry-go-round, roaring motor-
bikes, clink and clatter of
crockery, all the noise and push
and the great blaze of color
shouting back at the sun. And
when it was over, home, laden
like packhorses with “sample-
bags” and windmills on sticks
and round pencil-cases that
rattled, a little tired, slightly
dirty and immensely satisfied.
Different now, of course —we
only go along to give the small
boy an idea of what it was like
once. He had an urgent ap-
pointment elsewhere with some
cops and robbers this year, so
we went alone —just to look
around, that is, and bring home
a few things for the s.b.
The conductor said the tram
was going to the Show if it
didn’t break its ruddy back with
the load —which it didn’t —and
the man at the gate said we’d
get in some time if we got on
the end of the queue, which we
did, and the woman in front
said “I don’t know why I come
to the Show just to be pushed
around like this’, but I always
do.” “Programmes,” shouted the
man inside ; “Fairy floss,” yelled
his neighbor.... .“Hooplas ; nine
for a deener”.... .“I’d like
that cane lounge for the veran-
dah” “Where are the trac-
tors?”. ... .“Mum’s got some
preserved celery in the Agricul-
tural Ha 11”.... “Mind what
you’re doing with that ice-
cream.”
The freshly-painted machinery
is there after all; new cars,
too; furniture, fittings, radios,
refrigerators and lightshades;
supple black canes with kewpies ;
kids with ice-cream ; women in
jodhpurs; farmers with fresh
red faces like apples; lean,
brown men in wide-brimmed
hats “Two hundred quid for
that; ain’t they heard of Mr.
Chifley?” “She’s a beaut car
all right, but where do I buy a
permit?”.. . .“Look at that
bloke with the axe.” “Garn, I
bet his wife cuts the firewood.”
Pushing and being pushed....
standing in straw and yarning
over the back of a cow with a
fresh-faced New Englander...,
sun’s come out. G00d... .“Three
shots for a deener”.... district
exhibits.... fruit, honey, sugar-
cane, cotton, marrows, model
farms, pumpkins, big and
muscled like bullocks!... .“The
death de - fying riders”....
horsey humans and almost-
human horses, proud like hand-
carved chessmen “I wanna
go on the merry-go-round”
shoving, talking, listening....
“Where’s the beer?”.,. .“Yair,
the dahlias’re good,, but the
roses’ve got more smell.”
“You can get a feed, where the
old Burma Pavilion used to be,”
said the man with the white-
handled pocket-knife. “Red
Cross is serving meals there.
Good feed; clean, too”
“There’s good snapper-fishing
off the North Coast,” said the
man across the table “Rex
was upset by the long drive in
this morning,” said his owner.
.... “Oof,” said the handsome
Great Dane who had been up-
set, and “Oof” again, a few
octaves lower than Paul Robe-
son “Ki-yi-yike,” said the
terrier, while the silent spaniel,
with its agitated tail and glow-
ing brown eyes, said more than
any of them.
“Windmill on a stick, mister?”
.... better get one for the boy
.... don’t want any “sample
bags”— waste of money still,
that’s not a bad two-bob’s-
worth ; the boy’d like it.... two-
bob for that! Ah, well, it’s only
once a year... .can’t carry any-
thing else... .all right, empty it
into this bag... .can’t eat chips
and carry all this stuff seat
under that tree.... don’t sit on
that ice-cream bucket feet!
The tram’s back is bent but
not broken, and so home across
the harbor, laden like packhorses
with “sample bags,” windmill on
a stick and a pencil-case that
rattles, a little tired, slightly dirty
and immensely satisfied.
"Love In the Mist."
Kenneth Horne’s light confec-
tion “Love in the Mist” was
pleasantly served at Killara,
Jock Brown making an exag-
gerated but effective’Mr. Evans,
and Hazel Davys, Valerie Davys
and Norma Barker being lightly
competent in the feminine roles.
The plot, concerned with the
stranding of a couple on a
honeymoon and an unmarried
couple on the same errand, is
of the ancient bedroom variety,
but a violent attack of true love
in the last act saves the play
from wickedness, and verbal
wit saves' the drama —by a
narrow margin—from triviality.
The ladies in the cast extracted
the last essence of wit and
character out of their parts, and
the men, although slow to warm
up, were good in a Hollywoodish
way.
The Killara Theatre Guild’s
next play will be Priestley’s
“Time and the Conways.” No
doubt they will make a good
job of it, but it seems a pity such
an excellent amateur dramatic
association with such uniformly
good audiences does not emu-
late Doris Fitton’s crowd and
tackle something more am-
bitious. The Guild has a fond-
ness for light comedy, Priestley
and Shaw. With light comedy
there can be no quarrel, but too
much Shaw and Priestley can
harden the dramatic arteries.
Sydney Royal is occupied
by Professor Ceccarelli, who
claims “hypnotic power of mind
over matter.” On Saturday night
the prof, asked the house to clasp
its hands and hold them over-
head, close the eyes and wait
while he counted three. Anyone
who then found difficulty in un-
clasping his hands was in-
vited on to the stage for further
tests. Some were then rejected
as unsuitable and the others
were more or less' put through
the hoops—several went through
the motions of playing the
piano and of experiencing in-
tense heat and cold ; one young
man conducted an imaginary
orchestra and two others shaped
up to each other in a fanciful
lightweight championship. All
of them afterwards claimed to
have no recollections whatever
of their performances. Being
unaffected by any of the busi-
ness, present commentator can
say nothing except that prof.’s
show is dull enough to be
dinkum.
Current Films.
One of the most interesting
things observed in a recce, of
current films is that Sydney
Mayfair’s cat is partial to ice-
cream, and may be bribed with
spoons of the stuff to pause in
his rounds of the circle. Other
doings at the Mayfair include
“Indian Summer,” which con-
cerns a Boston Judge (Alexan-
der Knox) who leaves his Bench
and home and hearth for a spree
in California with Anne
Sothern, the local hamburger
queen. Such behavior is not
rated unusual by Hollywood
standards, so it’s not surprising
that the Judge winds up on the
Bench of the Supreme Court.
Dumas’s “Prince of Thieves”
has found temporary shelter at
Sydney Lyceum, and looks a
little anaemic in sticky color.
Although the events shown
allegedly took place in Sher-
wood when Robin Hood was a
tenant, Spike Jones and his boys'
would have seemed perfectly at
home in the eucalypt forest. At
least they would have fitted the
scene as naturally as some of the
chainmailed castle guards who
“toined out” whenever their
“lootenant” bade them in power-
ful Brooklyn dialect to “Rayze
the portcullis!”
“Killer McCoy” (Sydney St.
James), with Micky Rooney in
the title role, is modelled on the
earler fight film “Body and
Soul,” with John Garfield. Gar-
field slugged feasibly enough to
have one spectator tying a knot
in her umbrella, but the McCoy
looks as though he might just
hold his own with a paper-bag.
“Lured” (Sydney Plaza) has
Lucille Ball being used by Scot-
land Yard as decoy for a mani-
acal killer who might be George
Sanders, Cedric Hardwicke or
any one of several other her-
rings, red and slightly high.
“I Walk Alone” (Sydney
Prince Edward) is moody melo-
drama with Burt Lancaster re-
turning from 14 years’ prison to
find his bootlegging partner
(Kirk Douglas) has meanwhile
elevated himself to the pro-
prietorship of a swanky night-
club. After being spectacularly
beaten-up in a back alley, Mr.
Lancaster begins to see the light
and Lizabeth Scott, while Mr.
Douglas goes to the inevitable
end of death by lead-poisoning.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The AJ.C.’s Warwick Farm meet-
ing at Randwick on Saturday
did far more to confuse than to
clarify the problem of what’s going
to win the Autumn double. It would
surprise, however, if the winners
should come from anything outside
the bunch which contested Saturday’s
Chipping Norton Stakes and Liver-
pool Handicap.
The Chipping Norton standard
w.f.a. over 10 furlongs—saw all the
fancied runners finish well down the
course, a thrilling finish being fought
out by the three-year-olds Fresh Boy
(W. Cook) and Valiant Crown, both
at 20 to 1. Hitting the front right
from the jump Valiant Crown tried
to steal the race; at one stage he was
a good 10 lengths in front. Fresh
Boy, however, bridged the gap, to
finish a half-head to the good, though
Valiant Crown hung on gamely. Old
Silent was a really good third;
Columnist ran stone-last.
Bookmakers immediately moved
Fresh Boy to the top of the class for
the Cup, with Hiraji next on the
list. On weights and past handicap
performances, however, Hiraji should
again beat Fresh Boy in the Sydney
Cup. In the Caulfield Cup Hiraji
conceded him 201 b. and beat him for
second money. In the Melbourne Cup
Fresh Boy was in receipt of 151 b. and
was again beaten. It seems only
logical that Hiraji will again defeat
Fresh Boy in the Sydney Cup when
he has to give him only 91b. It also
seems utterly illogical handicapping.
Among others with a better-than-
fair chance in the Cup might be
mentioned Black Law, Dark Marne
and Proctor. Black Law’s recent suc-
cess over the Cup distance in Mel-
bourne was, in the colloquial, a
bottler. He lumped 8.13, or 61b.
more than his Cup weight, and ran
time that would win most Melbourne
Cups. Dark Marne is showing good
form, has beaten Hiraji at a distance
and has a handy 8.3 in the Cup.
Proctor, should he tackle the Cup,
is a class horse and has a class horse’s
weight.
Valiant Crown, for his. part in the
finish of the Chipping Norton, found
admirers for his Doncaster chances.
But then, the seven-furlongs Liver-
pool Handicap brought to light
an absolute horde of Doncaster pros-
pects. The winner, in good fashion,
was Murray Stream (J. Eaves), down-
ing Victory Lad and Star Port.
Murray Stream is a likely Don-
caster type, with plenty of speed and
stamina enough to have won two
Metropolitans, but inconsistency is
his middle name. He started at 15 to
1 in the Liverpool and it is interesting
to recall that two years back he won
the same race at the same odds, then
started second favorite for the Don-
caster and was unplaced. With 9.5
Victory Lad carried 31b. more than
his Doncaster weight and came from
the clouds to be a rattling good
second; definitely a possibility for the
mile. Doncaster favorite Money
Moon, having his first run in Syd-
ney, didn’t seem too happy about
the whole affair, ran an upside-down
race and yet did very well to finish
as close up as he did lumping a
crusher of 9.10.
The surprise packet in the Don-
caster might well prove to be Blue
Legend. The weight (9st.) may stop
this game little champion, but it’s
really a modest handicap for a horse
already responsible for the unequalled
effort of Winning two Doncasters and
an Epsom. He finished with all his
well-known dash to be not very far
behind the placegetters in the Liver-
pool.
Saturday’s racing having produced
such a fine profusion of red herrings,
this page will stick to its previously-
expressed Doncaster fancy, Titanic.
An Epsom winner with only 7.12 to
lump must be considered one of
the best handicapped horses in the
big Autumn mile. Carrying 8.3, he
was finishing at least as well as any-
thing else to be a close fourth in the
Liverpool and at his previous start
he won a nine-furlongs Welter lump-
ing 9.4. A class horse, leniently
handicapped, and at the top of his
form.
Progeny of Midstream did extra
well at Randwick and in the process
gave punters a battering. Murray
Stream is a Midstream; so too is
Herbert River (N. Sellwood), who
started at 15 to 1 for the 12-furlongs
Autumn Handicap and won a photo.-
finish from Dark Marne, with Lungi
third. Punters had their doubts abqut
Midstream’s Breeders’ Plate-winning
colt Riptide after his effort at Rose-
hill the previous week and they had
Heliofly an odds-on favorite for the
first Fairfield Handicap; Riptide, at
4 to 1, won it with ease.
v The second Fairfield went to the
fine-looking Brueghel filly Wattle (W.
Cook); a promising second to Wattle
was Bernbrook, another Midstream
and full-brother to Shannon. The
10-furlongs Cobbity Handicap for
three-year-olds went to Stamen (N.
Sellwood), the Encourage (12f.) to
Megaron, also ridden by Sellwood,
who’s having a change of luck, and
the mile Cabramatta Handicap to
Thrums (J. Thompson).
* * * *
About the Moonee Valley meeting,
held in perfect weather on Saturday,
there was a sense of aftermath. All
the recent inter-State visitors had re-
turned to their folds and with them,
went the cream of local horses.
Familiar names, too, were missing
from the riders’ semaphore. Racing
“glamor” had temporarily headed
north.
“Lucky” Porter will be lucky in-
deed if he ever has another such
good ’un in his stable as his old
champion St. Fairy. By far the best
field of the day contested the mile
Glenara Handicap and, carrying top-
weight of 8.13, the St. Magnus geld-
ing gave them a lesson in what it
takes to be a good horse. Badger
timed St. Fairy’s brilliant finishing
run perfectly to pip the odds-on
favorite Chanak; Belle Star was next.
The win took St. Fairy’s stake earn-
ings to £22,590.
An innovation at the Valley was a
sign near the winning-post indicating
the state of the track. For Saturday
it read “Track Fast,” which was no
exaggeration. St. Fairy equalled the
track record of for the mile,
and, in the course of four races over
the odd distance of six furlongs less
20yd., the record for that trip was
approached, equalled and beaten.
The record had stood at 1.12. In
the first Hollymount Handicap for
two-year-olds the Helios colt Phoibus
(R. Heather) clocked 1.13-J- to down
Mile End and Bruvaros. Improving
on that, El Faloos (S. Olsen) took
the second division in 1.12jr, Quilock
and Raysun filling the places. Older
horses had a go over the same trip
in two divisions of the Woodlands
Highweight. The four-year-old Dhoti
mare Mahram (N. Powell) won the
first from Trapani and Carnage; in
doing so she equalled the record. The
second division saw new figures set
by True Law, defeating High Pro-
duction and Yultarra in 1.1 If. True
Law is an aged Law Maker gelding
and hadn’t had a run for more than
12 months.
A class horse in a field of plodders,
Valcurl went out at odds-on for the
Moonee Ponds Handicap but struck
an unexpected snag in some-time
hurdler Latani. Leading most of the
way, Latani beat the favorite a
length and, clocking 3.1 equalled
the course record for furlongs.
“ Don't forget — it's a Federal, number four.”
Bold John, with Badger up, proved
too hot for Trumps, Colin’s Pride
and other three-year-olds in the Sher-
wood Handicap. The Travancore
Steeple went to odds-on favorite
Kindervale, with Bronze Laddie and
Henwood closest to him. About the
time Kindervale was passing the
judge, Anteros hove in sight of the
furlong pole after giving an exhibition
of jumping reminiscent of Mark
Twain’s frog. He got a great hand
from the crowd for his unexpected
success in completing the course.
For Randwick (before acceptances):
Vaucluse Handicap: Pearler, 1;
Trover, 2; Glencrag, 3. Sires’
Produce Stakes: Riptide, 1; Scotwyn,
2; Newborough, 3. Autumn Stakes:

3. A.J.C. St. Leger: Lungi, 1; Fresh
Boy, 2; Stamen, 3. Princess Handi-
cap : Befanna, 1; Jalna, 2; Nizam’s

Doncaster Handicap: Titanic, 1;
Blue Legend, 2; Star Port, 3.
Sydney Cup: Hiraji, 1; Fresh Boy,
2; Proctor, 3.
As a matter of prestige, the value
of the Melbourne Cup has been
bumped up to make it again the
richest race run in Australasia. This
year it is to be worth £12,500, plus
the £3OO drinking utensil. Owner of
the winner will bag £8750, second
£2500 and third £1250. It’s a pity,
however, that no fourth prize has
been provided.

Placegetters in the Aintree Grand
National run on Saturday were
Sheila’s Cottage (25 to 1), First of
the Dandies (25 to 1) and Cromwell
(33 to 1). The infamous Becher’s
Brook toppled favorite Silver Flame
on the first time round.

The cricket tourists set off in the
Strathaird. The tour will open
at Worcester on April 28, with
Tests at Nottingham (June 10-15),
Lords (June 24-29), Old Trafford
(July 8-13), Leeds (July 22-27) and
The Oval (August 14-20). The Board
of Control guarantees manager John-
son and the “amateur” players
£937 10s. each —a rise of £lB7 10s.
on the 1938 hand-out.
Characteristically, Don Bradman’s
last act before leaving for what he
says will be his last tour, was to
break yet another record. Knocking
up 115 against the Westralians, he
became the first batsman to score
eight centuries in first-class matches
in Australia in the one season. He
got them from 12 innings. The pre-
vious record was seven for a season,
thrice recorded by Don and once by
Wally Hammond,
* ■*. / * «
Sunday saw the Wallabies leave on
the last hop home after a grand
tour. In final matches in the States
they beat Californian teams 37-0 at
Los Angeles and 12-6 at Berkeley;
Stanford University succumbed 59-10.
In the European portion or the tour
Trevor Allen, as well as shouldering
the captaincy after Bill McLean had
done his leg, topped the scoring list
with 71 points (12 tries, 10 goals and
five penalty goals).
* * * •
With Bromwich and Pails unavail-
able our chances of regaining the
Davis* Cup are slim. Consequently,
the main justification for sending a
team should be to give up-and-com-
ing players, notably Victoria’s Frank
Sedgman, necessary experience. In-
stead Quist, Sidwell, Long and
Brown have been named as our team;
the exclusion of Sedgman is inexcus-
able,

Rivalling Tommy Burns as a photo-
genic proposition and not so very
far behind him as a pug, Ern Jarvis,
scaling list., made very short work
of Kev McCarthy at Leichhardt. It
lasted roughly one minute; McCarthy
down for five, groggily to his feet,
then down again before ref. Mawson
stopped the massacre. Burns holds
the Australian welter title; Jarvis
reckons Burns couldn’t make the
welter limit with a major operation
and wants to meet him at list.


x The many duties of an

•THERE are many different matters to be handled

FISH BUSINESS.
A general meeting of the
Tuggerah Lakes Fishermen’s
Co-operative on March 5, to
which the press was invited,
threw some small amount of
light on the complicated work-
ings of fish co-operatives, fish-
markets and N.S.W. Government
departments. The meeting was
held at Wyong (N.S.W.), Mr,
Frith, of the Chief Secretary’s
Department, representing the
Government, and among the
guests were the manager of the
Newcastle Fish Market, a
Fisheries Inspector, a represen-
tative of the recently-formed
Palm Beach Co-operative and a
gentleman who was simply in-
troduced as “the Communist
party.”
Immediate cause of dissatis-
faction was contained in the
secretary’s statement: the week
before Mr. Frith and a repre-
sentative of the Sydney Fish
Market called at the Tuggerah
Lakes depot and “directed and
demanded” that 100 boxes of
fish, already packed, be sent to
the Sydney market. The fisher-
men had already been paid for
the fish, and it appears that the
fish had, in fact, been already
ordered and the orders ac-
cepted within the co-op.’s de-
fined zone. All this was ex-
plained to the Government
man, whor nevertheless, insisted
that his order be obeyed; so
the fish was sent off to Sydney,
the co-op. losing £121 10s. 3d.
on the deal, not counting cost
of delivery to Sydney, ice, boxes,
wages to staff, etc.
Questioned on this matter
Frith said, in effect, that it was
simply a matter of redefinition
of boundaries. Manly, hitherto
in Tuggerah’s selling zone, was
now the province of the Palm
Beach show. And a directive
from the Chief Secretary was
read out, ordering that 50 p.c.
of the Tuggerah catch be sent
to Sydney.
At this point someone asked
a question: How long had the
Palm Beach Co-operative been
operating? The answer was';
A fortnight.
Mr. Clifton, a fisherman, then
stated that he had been advised
that the Government had no
power to define boundaries;
that he had, in fact, received
this information from a Gov-
ernment official. To this Mr,
Frith replied diplomatically, re-
marking that with 380,000 resi-
dents in the North Shore area,
the co-operative should have no
difficulty in selling its fish. This,
apparently, was not precisely
the point. The co-op.’s concern
was the dropped £l2l 10&'. 3d.
and the direction and demand
that 100 cases —or, as the Chief
Secretary stated it, “fifty per
cent, of production”—be sup-
plied to the Sydney Fish
Market.
To 3,, question concerning the
production of the Palm Beach
Co-operative, Frith asked for
notice, and from this point the
debate began to deteriorate. The
Government man’s arguments
tended to be emotional and
political.
There was talk of “if you
want a battle you can have it.”
Someone replied; “Then let’s;
have it.”
It was maintained, for the
McGirr Government, that Tug-
gerah was selling fish in other
areas seemingly a heinous
offence. The contention was re-
ceived with derisive cries.
Mr. Frith was asked; “Are
the Sydney markets capable of
handling fifty per cent, of our
production?”
Frith: I’ve told you before that not
a market in the world can guarantee
prices.
Questioner: Have you instructed all
co-operatives to supply 50 p.c. to the
Sydney market?
Frith: Yes.
The representative of a co-
operative, in a brief speech,
pointed out that the Tuggerah
area was not quite what it might
appear on paper, quoting as an
example the northern coalfields
area, where fish was’ being sup-
plied from other sources. Dora
Creek fishermen were men-
tioned, and in the course of a
somewhat heated conversation
it came out that some shops in
Cessnock had permission to buy
fish direct.
A voice; “Baddeley’s area!”
Mr. Patterson, of Tuggerah
Co-operative, was asked if his
concern, since its formation, had
been able to satisfy the demand
for fish. The answer was “No.”
A guest from*Newcastle spoke
at some length (despite interrup-
tions) on the virtues of co-
operatives ; he denied reports of
“chaotic marketing” in New-
castle, darkly hinted that such
reports were “inspired,” and re-
ferred ironically to the “good
old days” when fishermen “took
a terrific belting.” He depre-
cated competition between co-
operatives, saying that when
Tuggerah fish was sold outside
the legitimate zone “you are hit-
ting your fellow co-operatives
over the head with something
hard and heavy.”
Voice (with peculiar empha-
sis): “And vice-versa
With regard to the Sydney
Fish Market, the Newcastle man
said, he agreed that it had not
been properly run.
Voice: “Hear, hear!”
Newcastle man: You have had a
raw deal from Sydney, we have had
a raw deal from Sydney, we have all
had a raw deal from Sydney... .the
market is badly staffed, badly run,
and the Ministerial control is rotten.
That, in his opinion, was no
reason why it should be de-
stroyed, for he hoped that some
day it might be controlled by the
fishermen themselves.
Finally, the major business of
considering what steps 1 should
be taken was handed on to the
directors of the co-operative.
The matter of permits or “con-
sents” being raised again, it
came out that the law allows
the Minister to give a permit to
individual fishermen to sell
small amounts of fish —usual
“This bike y' just sold me carries a guarantee , doesn't It?”
a mpunt 101 b.—to the consumer,
As far as’ the Act and amend-
ment go. it seems that the
Minister has no legal power to
require fish to be sold other than
direct to consumer, and at the
Wyong meeting it was specially
recommended that the regula-
tions be policed, especially in
regard to the Dora Creek fisher-
men and coalfields fish-shops,
At present all permits' to fisher-
men in the Tuggerah Lakes area
bave been withdrawn.
The Wyong meeting being a
Sphering of producers’ not
much was heard from the con-
sumers’ angle-except from the
manager of the Newcastle mar-
ket and a few vague sentiments
from the Government man, Mr.
Frith. But consumers have a
lively interest in the complicated
machinery of fishing co-opera-
fives, marketing and Govern-
ment regulations; and the con-
sumer, likewise, has “taken a
terrific belting.”
Mr. Clive Evatt fathered the
.present scheme, announcing
on July 4, 1945 —when he was
Acting-Chief-Secretary—that the
“Sydney Fish Market would be
taken over by the State Govern-
ment pending the introduction
of a co-operative marketing
scheme.” And Mr. Baddeley,
then Acting-Premier, announced
that Cabinet had approved the
arrangement, that “the marketing
system had been unsatisfactory
and the Government had deter-
mined to make a change,” and
that “the scheme now evolved
was primarily a war-time mea-
sure.”
Like many another war-time
measure, it has persisted. The
position before it was introduced
was, very probably, “unsatisfac-
tory.”
But the present position is not
very far from chaotic, and may
easily grow worse. The Opposi-
tion might do well to make an
investigation into the whole
complicated business paying
special attention to the powers
of the Chief Secretary to “direct
and demand” the disposal of
quotas of fish, not forgetting the
recurring matters’ of “permits”
and the northern coalfields—
which include Mr. Baddeley’s!
own electorate.

Economic Changes
Recently the overall financial
outlook in Australia has assumed
a more mixed appearance. There
has been a hesitation in the trend
of export prices, previously ris-
ing steadily. There has been a
tightening of trade-restrictions
against countries asking for dol-
lars and other “hard” currencies
in payment for goods required
by Australia. Costs have been
rising in the Commonwealth,
and there has been a slowing-
down in the rate of saving by
the people. The entire State of
Queensland has been gripped by
a strike which has seriously
affected the export of wool and
other primary products. The
disruptive aims of the Com-
munist party are becoming more
obvious and determined in Aus-
tralian industry every day,
especially in those States where
no resistance is offered against
their treacherous activities.
Taxation remains stubbornly
high, and Canberra “controls”
are onerous and socialistic.
The European position is
dangerous; the Soviet makes
conditions' on the Continent
more insufferable with each
passing month. Britain’s con-
dition has startled many sec-
tions of Australian business
activity and the sharemarket
has been susceptible to all
these developments, and to
the speculative reaction on the
New York Stock Exchange and
the Chicago grain market. Yet
the volume of trade within Aus-
tralia remains at a high level,
and “the economics of scarcity”
are still the dominant feature of
the industrial landscape.
The wheat industry is perhaps
the most vulnerable, even
though the export price is still
around 20s. a bushel. Here a
world-stabilisation plan that
offers a maximum price of
12s. 6d and a minimum of about
6&'. a bushel is contemplated for
the five years from August this
year. A couple of good wheat
seasons in Europe could cause
a steep drop in the price of the
grain, which is overproduced
more readily than most other
agricultural and pastoral com-
modities. Wool is) in a stronger
position, and so are butter and
most metals. Even with wheat
at 10s. a bushel the Australian
industry would not be badly
off, especially if the rise in in-
ternal costs can be checked and
if seasons remain kind.
There has been a steadying in
the cost of some imports. Morris
cars have been reduced in price,
for instance. But nothing very
definite has yet occurred to in-
dicate that, overseas production
costs have ceased climbing,
which would be the only reliable
signal that the cost of imports
was going to stop rising.
Mr. Chifley has recently felt
impelled to urge Australian
trade-unionists to work harder
and produce more goods—this
after two months’ experience of
a 40-hour week which Judge
Foster, of the Arbitration Court,
seemed to expect would increase
instead of reduce production.
This) scarcity of goods affects
all values, and while it continues
the integrity of our currency will
continue to decline —that is, liv-
ing costs (and expenses of asset-
replacement) will go on inflat-
ing. Inadequate production is
the most influential political and
economic factor in the Com-
monwealth, and it also affects
the defence policy of the nation
and the British Commonwealth
—not only in the very obvious
case of the Centralian rocket
range.
The United States abandoned
price-control in 1946, and it now
has an output of goods' and ser-
vices far in excess of pre-war
levels. In Australia price-con-
trol has been a hindrance to pri-
vate enterprise, hitherto the most
fruitful source of goods produc-
tion, and it has been a
weapon of socialism, as has
been the specially heavy form
of taxation levied upon pub-
lic companies. A referendum
in respect of continuance of
price-control by the Federal
Government is to be held in
May. For a time it looked asi
though it might be carried by
the electorate ; but latest checks
made by the Australian Gallup
Polls, conducted by Roy Mor-
gan, indicate that continuance
of even this Federal control is
no longer desired by the people,
and that in May the Govern-
ment will suffer a reverse in its
appeal. Significantly, the Com-
munists have been all in favor
of retention of the power by
Canberra.
If price-control goes over-
board this year w e can expect
initial problems arising from
free prices and an excess of
spending-power ; but we have to
face that issue eventually, any-
way, and while the real level of
costs is disguised by controls
and subsidies the tendency is
for them to creep up all the
more. The freeing of prices
should set other economic
forces in operation, including an
increased incentive to produce;
but to work effectively there
should be further reductions in
taxation. This country badly
needs the return of a competitive
economy and the breaking-up of
all kinds of conspiracies against
production, whether they eman-
ate from the proprietary side of
industry or from trade-unions.
The latter represent the greatest
vested interest in reduced pro-
duction today; but they are en-
gineering their own rufti in sanc-
tioning the restrictions that their
union bosses have placed on
output in many vital industries'.
Apparently economic pressure
has to be put on trade-unionism
as a whole before it can be
brought to a reasonable state of
mind in this regard, though no
doubt a compulsory secret bal-
lot on major questions of trade-
union policy would do a lot by
itself.
The Australian-London ex-
change rate remains uncertain,
depending principally upon how
Britain fares over the next few
months. But the sudden turn
for the worse in political condi-
tions in Europe may hasten the
implementation of the Marshall
Plan, which has passed the U.S.
Senate, and this, when effective,
should relieve the strain on
sterling, and, incidentally, per-
haps make the Australian dollar
position a little easier. But, in
the long run, the stability of
sterling will depend upon the
volume of output and the level
of costs in Britain itself, a fact
which even the Socialists have
been forced to recognise.
All currencies, including
United States paper dollars, ap-
pear to have drifted a long way
from their gold parity since
1939. There has been very little
official discussion in Britain, the
United States or Australia about
gold since war began, but its
monetary importance seems
bound to crop up again before
very long. When it does it will
be found that the sterling, dol-
lar and Australian price of gold
is much below the metal’s real
parity. But perhaps it will be
best not to acknowledge that
fact too freely until production
of other commodities has caught
up with demand and world
price-levels have tended to stabi-
lise. A higher gold price tends
to boost other prices.
We in Australia have it within
our economic means to create a
period of great national progress
and industrial prosperity, world
confusion notwithstanding. But
to do so the quality of our
Federal and some State Adminis-
trations must be raised and in-
dustrial discipline enforced.
Under normal, competitive
conditions there is still scope
for greatly expanded earnings
by efficient Australian public
companies. Most have still even
to be allowed to catch up with
the depreciation in buying-
power of Australian money.
Australian industry has yet to
see anything like the record of
U.S. inflation in public-company
earnings and share quotations,
which recently experienced a
sharp reaction.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Macnell”; Almost every article, story,
book, photograph, painting or film about
angling is called “With Rod and Line.”
But the first business of the fisherman is
to catch fish, and there are more ways
of landing ’em without hooks than
anglers imagine. At Traitor’s Island, off
n.-w. New Guinea, natives fly a coconut-
husk kite with bait fastened to its tail,
bobbing just above water. Long Toms
were going for their lives, as were the
natives hauling their kites down and
dinners in. Using lights to attract fish is
as old as humanity. In Durban on a
water-lily lagoon Indians from the sugar-
mills hung a lantern over the bow and
dozed placidly while next day’s mullet-
dinner leapt in beside them. In the
Zambesi natives lay nets across-river,
Fish, lying nose-upstream, them-
selves to drift down-current. Before they
know it they’ve landed stern-first into
trouble. Perhaps the laziest of the “with-
out” tribe are the cormorant fishers of
Bombay. In the huge yellow-water bay
their flaring braziers dot the harbor while
a cormorant, a metal-band round its neck
to stop the catch descending further,
catches the fish as they leap for the light.
Half a dozen clever birds can easily
support their indolent master in affluence.
* * * «
“Curate’s Egg”: There is no need to
go into the deeps explored by Beebe to
find a fish which “explodes” in a flash
of light to dazzle pursuers (B. 10/3 / ’4B).
In N.Q. Barrier Reef waters there is a
finny specimen down whose sides run
two glands, each of which secretes a
different gas. These gases, luciferin and
luciferase, are non-luminous in them-
selves, but in combination generate a light
flash which enables the fish to slip away
during the momentary blindness of its
pursuer.
“Ha! A nigger in the Woodpile!”
“GToper”: Don’t attempt to eat your
witchetty grub raw as did “Hep’s” sarge
(B. 18/2/’48); only an abo. can really
relish one that way. Start by impaling
the grub on a wire and grill slowly over
a light flame. When crisp the provender
is ready. I once worked on the Kurra-
wang Woodline (W.A.) with an eldedy
German who specialised in “bardies.”
The forest was of salmon-gum, one of
the smoothest and cleanest of the euca-
lypts. Internal rot generally took the
form of a spongy punk. In this the
bardies waxed big and fat; so, as the
day’s toil proceeded, Hans dumped his
catch into a billy. At tea-time the catch
went into a frying-pan greasy from the
breakfast bacon. Fried, they possessed,
according to Hans, a flavor unsurpassed.
Always hospitable, he never failed to offer
a visitor a taste, but if declined he was
never offended. Something of a classical
scholar, he would quote the epicures of
ancient Rome, who, he averred, fattened
bardies for their tables on a diet of flour
and wine. “I sup with Lucullus,” he
would answer to critics. The taste is
rather like fish-roe slightly tinged with
cinnamon.
“Waddlin’ Willie”: Tasmania’s oldest
apple-tree—a 118-year-old French crab
—which has attracted inter-State visitors
for many years, is no more. Fierce gales
and storms in the Apple Isle early this
month were too strong for the veteran.
Planted at Swansea in 1830 by the pioneer
Adam Amos, the tree has regularly
yielded three bushels cf fruit every year.
* * * *
“Eastern”: Far past the range of
cattle-pads and fences, we camped on the
upper reaches of a little-known stream.
The night was warm and still, and,
wakeful on my bed of tussocks, I took
in the scene. The silence was acute.
Listening intently, it seemed to throb and
reverberate in strange singing, while on
every side was a breathless and mystic
beauty. Overhead the old river gums,
their trunks white in the modnlight, hung
black and shapeless against their back-
ground of light, and across the flat the
giant tussocks stood in little secretive
groups. The night had taken charge.
It camouflaged fallen timber, rocks and
dead brush with a coating of silver until
every daylight ugliness was hidden.
Presently from a black slope came the
shattering howl of a dingo. Minutes
passed before it was repeated closer in.
I raised a cautious head to peer across
the flat. Ghostly spectres everywhere,
waiting . . . waiting . . . Then came the
squeal of a rabbit in mortal terror —a
squeal that ended abruptly. There was
nothing more. The interlude was finished.
Again the singing silence descended, and
the moonlight etched its eerie world of
beauty, hiding yet another ugliness. The
night had taken over once more,
* ♦ * ♦
“Conda”: Organised attempts to
eliminate sharks from Sydney beaches
may benefit surfers, but a similar drive in
Port Phillip Bay resulted in loss for
shrimp-fishers. Octopuses, a favorite dish
with sharks, multiplied freely under the
shark-hunt and cleaned up the coast’s
best shrimp-grounds.
* * * *
“Shamuseen”: In scouting the senti-
mentalism which ascribes binghi’s de-
cline to the advance of civilisation,
“Colonial Cove” (B. 3/ 3/ ’4B) is himself
astray in accepting the Wellsian theory
of the white man’s microbe as the abo’s
chief destroying agent. The plain fact is
that binghi, the stone-age man, was near-
ing his extinction long before the First
Fleet arrived. In fact, civilisation has if
anything halted the decline. Lacking the
rudiments of agriculture, for binghi each
drought, with its curtailment of natural
growth and game, was another mile-
stone on his sunset trail. Proof
is provided by the reversal of the dis-
appearing process in the Kenwyn River
district of Cape York, N-Q. Fourteen
years ago first contact with the natives
showed them so debilitated by starvation
that old people’s locomotion was habi-
tually on all fours, and puberty was absent
in females whose dental age was 18. No
males were present for observation, as
these chivalrous gentry had gone bush,
abandoning the women and old people to
the “invaders.” Through communication
“See if you can dig up a spare steering-wheel, will you, Hilda?”
established by leaving several of the agri-
culturally skilled Torres Straits islanders
behind, the Kenwyn River people today
are a comparatively virile stock, and,
under missionary auspices, rapidly
increasing in population.

“Gip”: Bill had to meet the city agent
at the pub, so, riding to the township, he
left his nag at the blacksmith’s shop and
started towards the street. “Hey, just a
minute!” old Jack called after him.
“Better stick y’r monicker in those two
raffle-books. It’s for the hall fund.” Bill
had barely done so when “Well, now,”
greeted a familiar voice. “I thought I
might catch you here. Round for our
usual self-denial collection, you know.”
Ten minutes later Bill reached the store
verandah and Charlie Proctor. “G’day,
Bill,” Charlie called. “That bloke col-
lectin’ for bush'fire-relief is lookin’ f’r you.
Wants a couple of fat sheep or their
value. How’s things? Didn’t see y’ at the
bush-nurse meetin’ last night.” “No,” Bill
answered. “How’d things go?” “All
right. Bit short o’ funds, so we decided
we’d all chuck in a quid or two,” Charlie
explained. “Right with you? Church
people’s gonna help too, if we support
their effort. Here comes their secretary
now. He’s gettin’ in before Bung stings us
with his hospital appeal.” A bit later Bill
met the agent. As he scraped round in his
pocket for the wherewithal he caught the
other’s grin. “About your only expense,
eh?” the agent chuckled. “Gripes, you’re
lucky living out here in the country where
you haven’t got to be spending money all
the time.”

“Wonk”: Used to think that bull-ant
cure for rheumatism was all eyewash
till we tried it out on old Dan. Dan’s
missus got the idea when the old bloke
was lying round in her way with an extra-
bad bout, but not being able to locate a
bully she got me to help. I snared one
of them, and Mrs. Dan emptied it into
the bed, then I stuck around after Dan
went. After a good while there’s a
helluva bellow from the bedroom, and
Mrs. Dan rushes in to explain. You
see, she hadn’t told the old bloke before-
hand, just in case he got pigheaded and
wouldn’t co-operate. Dan’s funny like
that. But it worked right enough. Dan
still limps something awful, but it’s not
rheumatism. Fact, any time we mention
it he gets mad as blazes and bawls out
that he ain’t got no more flamin’
rheumatism, an’ just see we don’t forget
itr

“B. A. Ker”: It was given as truth in
a Sydney daily, and I’m wondering
whether the reporter was entirely ignor-
ant of Australian natural history or
merely thought everybody else was.
As reported: “A wild ‘opossum’ gave
birth to twins in a suburban laundry.
Thinking the bundle of grey fur in the
clothes-basket was her child’s toy, the lady
of the house was about to move it when
the possum ‘chattered’ at her. Then the
animal was observed to be playing with
two baby possums.” The accompanying
photo showed a man patting a big silver-
grey. Now, I’ve never known a possum
to chatter; I would describe the sound
emitted by a disturbed mother possum as
something between a snort and a “rasp-
berry.” Bush possums can be trained to
come down out of the trees and accept
tit-bits, but my guess is that a mother
possum would allow a stranger to stroke
her in the daytime only if she had been
somebody’s pet for a long time. As for
the alleged playing with her newly-bom
babies, those joeys must have been at
least a month old. When the young
possum is born it is a tiny, hairless, ugly
creature that becomes attached to the
nipple immediately it is placed in the
pouch. Not until joey has become a
furred, pretty little thing does he become
disconnected from the teat again and
thus able to enjoy the affectionate play
of his mother. And twin possums are
rare —as rare as responsible statements
from Canberra.

“Old-timer”; Pocketknife, by the
diligent saving of a modicum of his pay
every week and a win of £23 10s. at two-
up, had accumulated £25 with which to
set off for Sydney’s Easter Show and
races. This was about the 11th time in
15 years that P. had set out for Syd-
ney ; hitherto he had never got further
than the Globe at. Deniliquin. All hands
conspired to get him to Sydney, and
among the more brilliant notions was
that of Little Curl, who urged P. to send
£2O to himself by registered post, care of
Sydney G.P.O. After a deal of argu-
ment P. consented, and the whole gang
went with him to the local p.o. to see the
letter sent. Next day we put him on the
motor-coach for Hay, nearest rail town.
Ten days later he was back. “How’d
Sydney go?” “Dunno,” he said. “On
the way up I see so many good towns
that I reckoned she’d be great t’ spend
me twenty quid doin’ ’em on the way
back. So when I get in I wait till the
post office opens I —cripes, it’s about a
thousand times bigger than the woolshed
—gets me cash an’ hops the first train to
Cootamundra. Been cornin’ back ever
since, an’ had a roarin’ time —better’n
y’d get pokin’ round that! Sydney place.”

“Spinifex”: A well-known Sydney
horse-trainer has opined that if a horse
with one white leg “went wrong” the
trouble would almost certainly be in that
leg. Similarly, a white dog with a black
patch around one eye will probably have
a weakness (especially of the tear-duct) in
the white eye, while the one with the
black border will be sound. Many ex-
perienced dog-owners regard white-eared
dogs as more liable to suffer from ear
trouble (canker, etc.) than those with
“colored” ears ; and albinos —human and
otherwise —frequently have poor eyesight.
It does seem that white hair, in animals,
is an indication of weakness.

“Hub”: I was telling an old sheepman
how a jackeroo was expending a lot of
time and sweat “maggoting” on fly-
struck sheep out Cobar way. “Yes,” he
said, “they have to work harder now than
when I was jackerooing in the same sort
of country about the end of last cen-
tury. Of course, conditions generally are
far better now, but when we had done
with the shearing and the lambing we
had a lot more time to ourselves than
they have now. We never knew what a
fly was then. It’s like all those
other pests introduced from other
countries and find a happy hunting-
ground here. The fly didn’t cause any
trouble until after the big nineteen-O-two
drought; it was brought here by the Ver-
mont sheep.” Vermont sheep had been
introduced from America, mainly b>
McCaughey, to increase the weight ot
Merino fleeces, and for quite a while the
importations had swept the pool at all
the shows. Although they had been de-
veloped from pure Spanish Merino
strains they failed here because they were
too wrinkly and couldn’t stand up to the
hot, dry conditions. In a drought they
were the first to take the knock. I had
never heard them blamed before, how-
ever, for the introduction of the fly.
SONG OF KIMBERLEY.
No dust rises as the herd goes by
And the sun hangs saffron in a sullen sky.
Creak of leather and a tang of sweat
And we’re making Wyndham to confound the
wet.
Dull dusk falling on a region strange
And the grey Ord roaring through the Carr Boyd
range.
Days strain-dreary and the nights sleep-short
As we sway our cattle down to Wyndham Port.
No thanks owing for a fight fair won
But the calming comfort of a job wfell done.
(Dull dusk falling on a region strange
And the grey Ord roaring through the Carr Boyd
range.)
Weary horses at the river bend
But we needs must ride them to the journey’s
- end
With a creak of leather and a quelch of hoofs,
And a warm rain drumming' on the homestead
roofs.
Sulky moonlight in a smoky sky;
(No dust rises as the mo,b goes by)
But we sense the firmness of the Twelve-Mile
Plain
And the wind-borne incense of the Inland rain.
W.A.

“Remfil”: His dial eroded by time and
beer, his whiskers lush, his deep-sunk
eyes peering out from between the corks
that dangled around his hat, he inhabited
the shade of an old kurrajong, the only
tree in a plain as large as a Yorkshire
Riding. We shared the dew-proof tree
for the night. He spoke but once —not
to me, nor to himself, but to his boots
after he had taken them off. I gathered
that he was hurt at their behavior of the
previous week. One he called Bobindie
and the other Gobarralong. Pursuant to
his usual nightly habit he had, it seemed,
placed the trilbies facing the direction of
the morrow’s compass-bearing. But the
dawn had showed Bob to be pointing one
way and Gob the other, and he’d been
there since Sunday barefoot debating the
resolution and the amendment. But the
next morning all was harmony again ;
Bob and Gob were of one mind, there
was a clear majority decision in favor of
going west, and my knight of the plains
was greatly relieved at their decision.
So was I —l was making east.

“M.S.”: Early in March the butcher-
bird’s song faded in against a background
composed mostly of the warblings of
magpies and the blowfly-in-bottle noises
of zebra-finches. It took me a second to
wake up to the butcher. Just as I did
last year, I accepted his first outburst as
a magpie’s, but once I had re-identified
his voice I wondered that I could con-
fuse the two even for a second. True,
they have in common a flute-like quality
of tone, but they differ much as Shak-
speare differs from all other word-artists.
The magpie delivers a one-man conversa-
tion punctuated by coarse chuckles and
droll screams of surprise, then confounds
his listener with phrase after phrase of
breathtaking beauty. And he pours it all
out so carelessly! The butcher-bird’s
range is much more restricted. Still, he’s
no mean performer. Some of his notes
resemble the passionate scolding of the
blackbird at dusk, others the cachinations
of the jackass. His finest air, though, re-
calls a phrase from the “Be Not Afraid”
chorus from “Elijah.” Rather out of
character this, considering his fearsome
attitude to smaller birds.

“E. 2”: When his first son was born
Dan made it known round the district
that all his kids were going to get a
“collige edjercation,” though from where
he was likely to spring the funds re-
mained obscure. Dan pottered on with
his selection and got no further ahead;
the kids grew up and branched out on
their own. Young Tom’s missus, pre-
senting him with a nipper, reminded
Andy. “I s’pose y’ll be sendin’ him t’
collige some day,” he said. “Not him,”
Tom answered. “It might make him con-
ceited. Take the rest o’ the fam’ly, how
stuck-up they are through the old man
always bein’ goin’ t’ give ’em a collige
edjercation. But not me. He always
reckoned I was too dopey f’r collige, an’
it never went t’ me head like the others.”

“Mat’s Mate”: He was about 18,
weighed about seven stone and was full
of cheek. The more beer he drank the
cheekier he became. At last he began
to pick on Mat —doubtless confident that
the big fellow wouldn’t use violence on
him —and in his strident voice uttered
sarcasms about Mat’s shearing ability.
Mat took it for a time, then he grabbed
the midget and sat him on the bar floor.
“Can’t shear, can’t I?” he roared. He
picked up an imaginary handpiece, pulled
it into imaginary gear, grabbed the
“sheep” by the neck, emitted a buzzing
noise. His right hand flashed up and
the waistcoat flew aside. “Belly-wool,”
grunted Mat. “Open up the throat.”
Collar and tie flew off. He turned the
“sheep,” off came coat and braces, over
went Midget, Mat grabbed a boot, peeled
“I’m SORRY you cant stay!"
off his pants and heaved him through the
parlor door. But his kind are irrepres-
sible, Stripped to singlet and shorts, he
shoved his face in and demanded “Hey,
what’s me fleece worth?” “A couple
of beers,” said the grinning publican.
* * * *
“Macnell”: Typhoons are revolving
storms, swirling at frightful velocity
round a low-pressure area in the centre.
Crossing from Bali to Darwin we struck
the edge of one —and the edge was
enough. About noon on a clear day a
long swell was noticed growing from the
sou’-east. An hour later the sky was dirty
like a smoked ceiling. Then came the first
warning puff of wind. We felt its chilly
blast and saw it, like a shadow, move
across the dark water ahead. A moment’s
lull, then came a stronger gust of icy air
that whipped the crest of a near-by swell
into smoke. In a few moments the sea
was thrashed white by the wind, which
was a snarling whine in the rigging, and
growing in force. Within a space of 10
minutes the entire aspect of the eastern
horizon had changed. It looked as
though an inert mass of low cloud was
being rolled up from the rim of the sea
in dark, horizontal folds, trailing like an
immense opaque curtain over the jyater.
Then the typhoon came slewing across
the world and reached us. The sea lifted
itself in a mountain of apparent liquidity
and struck like a steel gauntlet. The
ship shuddered under the hard thrust of
tons of water. She stooped under the
blow. A tremendous wave roared against
her stern, made a breach over her as
over a deep-swimming log, and, brushing
aside the puny counter-effect of rudder,
swept her at right-angles to her course.
Before she could stagger upright another
waterfall reared up and thundered upon
her in a crushing avalanche of liquid
green. But she was game. Cunningly
and stoutly she began to resist the new
master, and challenged it. A frigate, she
was the child of such storms, was de-
signed by an age of them. An hour later,
clear of the violent fringe, she rode easily
to the swell, salt-caked, boatless, but still
afloat.
* * * *
“Bosun’s Mate”: Saw a sub-ocean
cable hauled in over the bows of a cable-
ship once. It looked like a leg of mutton
mauled by a lion. Armor sheath torn
away by sharks or rubbing on rocks, the
tendons of steel hung tangled down
through a matting of mud, barnacles and
seaweed. These giant wires, which make
a Clapham Junction of ocean-beds out-
side great seaports, must lie in the slimy
ooze under miles of water without main-
tenance for years. Their worst enemies
are the teredo-worm and sharks. To
combat these several layers of gutta-
percha are first wrapped round the core.
The gum has excellent insulating qualities
under conditions of pressure and low
temperatures prevailing in ocean depths.
Over these is served a thick coating of
wet jute, forming a soft bed for the
wrapping of tough iron wire to follow.
Around this fits the sheath of armor.
The completed cable is often six to nine
inches thick, weighing as much as 30 tons
per mile. The really essential part inside,
the conductor, is as thick as your finger.

“Cob”: End of the mango season in
North Queensland means sounder sleep-
ing for many householders. From
Bowen to the far north nearly every home
has at least one mango-tree. Many are
surrounded with them, and during the
ripening period nightly hordes of flying-
fox shelter in them and kick up an in-
fernal din as they squeal and squawk
over some choice specimen. The one
that gets the mango tries to fly off, but
generally succeeds in dropping his prize,
with a horrible smack, on the galvanised-
iron roof.

“Bo”: We struck him at one of the
township’s two pubs, and after his third
schooner the spirit of recklessness pre-
vailed and he pulled out some bush verse
he had written and proceeded to dramatic
declamation. The burden of his muse
was the scrumptiousness of the outdoor
life. Give him, he sang, but a bunk
under the heavenly canopy where the
sight of the eternal stars in their courses
would bring balm to his wounded soul,
and he would consider a monarch in his
downy four-poster a wretched wight by
comparison. It was obvious from the
bard’s outpourings that he would even
scorn to dig a hip-hole in Mother
Earth. We heard him out, thankful that
he had spared us at least any reference
to a bronc or a “paint” pony. Around
11 o’clock, as we were leaving McKellar’s
store for home after the usual game of
crib with Mac, we beheld the spectacle
of an irate Bung tossing a battered suit-
case after the ejected versifier, with
luridly-spiced advice to inflict his
presence on Kelly along at the Royal.
After Bung’s blood-pressure had sub-
sided somewhere below the 200 mark
we learned that the lover of the alfresco
bunk had abused the dispenser of hos-
pitality because his mattress was lumpy!

“Plop”: Possibly some Aboliar can
save them a lot of indigestion, but until
help arrives three research men at Cam-
bridge, England, will go on eating every
variety of bird’s-egg they can get, attempt-
ing to help out the food situation there
by determining which eggs are palatable
and which will curdle one’s tonsils. Using
10 as the highest possible flavor-rating,
they have found hen-eggs best with a
score of 8.8. Other scores were turkey,
7.2 ; gull, 7 ; crow, 6.6 ; duck, 6.5. The
stoics claim that big birds generally lay
good stuff, adding with a shudder that
small fowl, notably the wren (on 2), are
responsible for atrocities. The theory
they have adduced is that the small fry,
which cannot stoush attackers, lay their
time-bombs to form a delayed counter-
offensive.

“Zake”: Clisby’s new hand had been
sent with the cart to bring a load of
gravel up from the river for some im-
minent concreting work. A couple of
hours later Clisby came out from morn-
ing tea in the kitchen to see the hand
emerge from the toolshed carrying an
axe. Questions elicited the facts. The
laden cart had hit a low stump on the
way up from the river and had turned
over. Captain wasn’t hurt, but with the
cart still half-full of gravel he couldn’t
shift. The hand was going back with the
axe to hack the shafts off to free the
horse. “But, y’ blinded idiot!” roared
Clisby. “Y’ don’t need to ruin the cart.
Y’ could undo the harness or, if you
haven’t got brains enough for that, cut
the traces, couldn’t y’?” “Y’ went crook
enough when I chucked the saddle on to
the barbed-wire the other day,” replied
the hand hotly. “What’d you have said
if I’d come back with busted traces?”
* * * *
“Plankton”: Much resembling paper
drinking-straws are curious objects I
often notice sticking up an inch or so
above the muddy sand at low tide in some
parts of Moreton Bay (Q.). They always
are about a foot apart, and occur in
pairs. That a connection exists between
them isj proved on blowing down one
tube, when the water inside is expelled
from the other, but that doesn’t signify
it contains nothing else, as is usually
surmised. On the contrary, careful and
rapid excavation with digging-forks will
show that between the quite short ex-
tremities there extends a much wider and
pliable tube wherein resides a parchment-
tube worm ( Chaetopterus ). This unique
creature is the most specialised of its
tribe. Food is swept into the tube by
a continuous current of water set up by
the action of three triangular fans about
the centre of the body. The minute prey
becomes entangled in a sticky mucus
exuded by the worm, small particles are
secured by a pair of large-pointed, leaf-
like appendages, whence they are de-
posited in a central cup-shaped organ ;
here the food is moulded into small pills
and then carried by capillary action along
a narrow groove until finally it reaches
the mouth. Seemingly this oddity must
lead the life of a hermit, the extremities
of the tube being much too narrow to
allow egress when adult. Relatives of
this species having long vertical tubes
are often very beautiful. One I saw on
the Barrier Reef has a spreading crown
of whitish tentacles with pink spots.
While another, the loveliest to come my
way, is of royal-blue and superficially
much like a gerbera blossom*
NORTH WIND.
When the north wind it comes blowing
Its blasts as if from Hell,
I smell the dry lands reaching,
The hot and dusty smell
Of plains and great wool-wagons,
High-piled with bales the loads,
Fleeces from northern stations
That came by dusty roads.
When dust-clouds they come rolling
As the sun burns hot on high,
It’s then I smell that far dust
That once in clouds burned by,
And sense the shimmering hazes,
The crow’s eternal cries,
The drovers, sheep and horses,
Out where the wide land lies.
Again I feel the story
Each time the wind burns down:
The story and the glory
Of lean men strong and brown;
And I, in fancy, listen,
And see and hear it all:
The 'plains’ incessant throbbing
Their far and silent call;
See men keen-eyed and riding
Where circling eagles fly;
The long, grey lines of fences,
The sheep-dogs panting by,
The plains for ever stretching
Out to the hazy bars
Where distance rides majestic
And silence holds the stars.
So when the north wind’s blowing,
It sets my heart to roam
Back to the northern stations,
The sheep plains out from home;
And though my fields be greener,
And narrower my lanes,
I smell the far dust blowing
In the north wind off the plains.
VICTORIA.

"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Lambing Ewes.
“Mr.”: The treatment ewes
receive during pregnancy goes a
long way towards ensuring a
successful lambing season. J. T.
Kelly, B.V.Sc., in Vic. “Journal
of Agriculture,” recommends
getting the ewes used to humans
and dogs well before lambing
begins. This applies to maiden
ewes particularly. These silly
things may abandon their lambs
when startled. The tendency of
young ewes to • bolt can be
checked by running them with
older sheep.
In each paddock have a small
pen where ewes which refuse
their lambs can be placed until
they mother up, and where
bereaved ewes can be persuaded
to adopt an orphan <
Crutch the ewes about a
month before lambing to reduce
risk of flystrike and give the
lambs a chance to suckle under
hygienic conditions. Feed them
sufficiently well to maintain or
slightly increase weight up to a
month before lambing. Then
increase the feed, as most losses
occur when ewes are falling
away.
Rugs for Cows.
“K.W.R.”: A cornsack rug
for each cow will mean the
difference between a hungry
herd huddled beneath some in-
adequate shelter and a herd out
feeding through the heaviest
shower or coldest day. Two
sacks sewn together for the
body of the rug and another
across the withers and shoul-
ders, short lengths of rope or
cord for a breeching, with
straps buckling under the belly
and brisket, are all that is
necessary. Though not really
waterproof (unless treated), until
they have been in use for some
time, these rugs keep the cows
warm. They should be on day
and night while rain or cold
weather continues. During
winter the rugs should be re- (
moved on fine days.
Mounting the Colt.
“Wirrameju”; Mounting
should be quite as much an
exercise for the colt as for his
rider. Blindfolding or immobi-
lising a colt by tying his legs
and such methods have their
places where horses have to be
in work quickly or where a colt
has turned vicious. But they
have no place with quiet stock.
Here the aim is to teach the colt
to stand quietly while the rider
mounts and to stay there until
he gets a signal to move off.
Tie the colt to a centre post
and saddle him. Then get a
light switch and with this tap
him behind one knee until he
moves his foot forward. Pat
him, then work on the other leg.
Work on alternate legs, then,
until he stands “spread out” —
his hind feet together and his
front feet together and two or
three feet further from the hind
ones than normally. Don’t try
to spread him too far for a
start: a foot is plenty, and make
him maintain the position.
Repeat the lesson as often as
possible until a tap behind the
“ ‘Safety-firsi' is our motto , Bill!”
knee will immediately produce
the “spread” position. It is
necessary for the colt to take a
step before he can break the
stance. The time which that
step will occupy should be
ample for even a mediocre
horseman to be safely in the
saddle and his foot in the iron.
That, however, is, secondary to
the fact that this is the colt’s
part of the exercise of mounting,
and when he comes to recog-
nise it as such the whole exer-
cise will no longer be to him
the fearful business it is of hav-
ing a man suddenly clambering
on to his back.
When he has mastered this
exercise begin the actual mount-
ing. “Spread” him out and,
while he holds the stance, put
your foot in the near iron and
apply some weight gradually.
Repeat this often, gradually in-
creasing the weight and the time
for which it is applied, until you
can safely stand in the iron for
a full minute. Don’t make him
hold the stance too long; after
a couple of minutes break it
and give him a short rest before
continuing the exercise. Be
alert always for a forward or
sideways jump. Once you can
stand in the stirrup unhurriedly
ease yourself into the seat. Don’t
flop in and don’t wave that
right leg. Keep the left knee
hard in to his shoulder, just
clear the cantle with your right
knee and find your iron behind
his off elbow with your foot
turned a bit inwards. If you
don’t find the iron
at this stage don’t
kick it round in
looking for it. Dis-
mount and try
again.
Taking him in
easy stages (and
with plenty of encourage-
ment from you), in about
20 or 30 minutes he will
stand quietly while you
vault stirrupless in and
out of the saddle, I al-
ways follow the same
mounting procedure on
both sides, but be careful.
It takes a lot of practice
to dismount from the off-
side gracefully and quickly.
The following day he will
need less preparatory
work, and you will be able
to mount in a minute or
two. Sit in the saddle for
longer periods. If you
consider it safe move
round in the saddle a bit,
patting and handling him
and putting your feet out
where he can see them dis-
tinctly. Take a kerosene-
tin or the sheep-pup up
with you, hang bags on
the dees. Anything, in
fact (except sudden noise,
jerky movements or kicks),
to get him thoroughly
used to your mounting
and to lull him into a
peaceful submission.
The entire lesson in mounting
should be spread over three 20-
or 30-minute periods. From
achieving this much without a
buckjump show riding him suc-
cessfully is almost assured.
A ’Hopper-killer.
“Graz”: The great grass-
hopper ravages so confidently
predicted by the Sydney dailies
didn’t happen. The pests spread
from Moree to Riverina, but,
though isolated districts were
ravaged, in most places the
alleged myriads hatched in
January just faded out.
A species of tachinid-fly
(.Locustivora pachytyli), a para-
site of ’hoppers, has had a good
time. Maggots from the fly, a
greyish insect about 3-id. long,
feed in the necks of ’hoppers
and later eat their way out and
burrow into the soil.
The success of parasites—
there are others beside Locusti-
vora pachytyli —this one season
gives rjo cause for a laissez-faire
attitude. Graziers want to know
if these parasitic flies can be
rapidly cultivated by entomolo-
gists and liberated each season
where plague ’hoppers appear.
Perhaps Mr. Chifley could use
some of those war-time wool
profits to find out.
Mud for Fowlhouses.
“J J.A.”; For permanence,
cheapness, uniformity of tem-
perature and ease in keeping
vermin down a mud-brick or
rammed - earth fowlhouse is
hard to beat. Mud can be
rammed into formers with the
same results as concrete, but the
formers can be taken off im-
mediately if the clay is as stiff
as it should be. It should be
reinforced like concrete.
Mud is cheaper and in these
times far more plentiful than
cement. The mud walls are
cool in summer and warm in
winter. A room made of mud
in this manner only varies, at a
maximum, two degrees from
summer to winter. An open-
fronted fowlhouse, of course,
will have a slightly greater varia-
tion.
In wet districts the mud walls
will need plastering. Cement or
lime plaster will do, and a cheap
plaster can be made with cow-
manure as a basis. It consists
of fresh cow-manure, clay and
sand in equal proportions; it
sticks to the wall like glue and is
waterproof.
With such walls and floors it
is easy to keep vermin down by
spraying, as a good spray-pump
will force the disinfectant into
the smallest crevices. The walls
should be sprayed every time the
pen is cleaned out, if only to re-
move the dust.
Fibro-cemept roof-sheets are
beneficial. There is less change
in temperature and the dew does
not collect under them and drop
into the pen.
The Separator.
“Mr.”: Keep a watch on these
points: Turn the driving wheel
at the speed specified by the
maker; different makes and
sizes have different speeds.
Separate the milk as near to
bloodheat as possible; cold
cream clogs the discs and re-
duces efficiency. The float is to
regulate the flow of milk into
the bowl, so make sure there’s
no fluid in it to weigh it down
and allow more milk through
than it should. Check the dist-
ance between the upper edge of
the cream-cover and the bot-
tom of the cream screw-lug on
the top disc (it should be about
one twenty-fourth inch); adjust
the bowl height by the screw
under the bowl spindle. The
machine should be capable of
handling in an hour all the milk
from the herd. If it runs longer
the slime forming on the discs
will reduce the butterfat taken
from the milk.
Sorghum-planting.
“T.T.T.”: “W. Court” is
astray (B, 3/3/’4B) when he says
that the sorghum-planting sea-
son is at hand. Sorghum is a
summer crop and is sown from
September to December. The
first frost kills it, and if sown in
March its expectancy of life
would be about six weeks, when
it would be killed by the first
frost.
It is not likely that the sweet
sorghums will be forgotten in
favor of the new dwarf varieties.
Sweet sorghums are grown on
coastal dairyfarms * for green
fodder, whilst the dwarf varieties
are the grain sorghums, grown
inland for their grain. The
popularity of the sweet sorg-
hums would not be affected if
we grew 20,000,000 bushels of
grain sorghum annually.
Grain sorghums, of which
Milo and Kalo are the main
varieties, have become popular
during the last eight years in
southern Queensland and
northern New South Wales, and
a record annual production of
4,000,000 bushels was produced
in 1946-47 ; 600,000 bushels ex-
ported, the remainder fed pigs
and poultry.
Vee Belts.
“Radian”: For short drives
they offer a big improvement in
power transmission, belt-slip is
almost unheard of and machines
can be kept closer together. Vee-
drive is particularly suitable for
small pumps, cream-separators
and electric generators. A range
of small vee-pulleys is available
from hardware merchants.
When fitting up a vee-drive
select your pulleys with bores to
suit existing shafts and having
diameters correct for speed ratio
required (B. 25/2/’4B). Pulleys
are available to take one or
more belts, and it pays to err
on the safe side for longer belt-
life. I fit-one belt for powers up
to half-horse, two belts for one-
horse and three belts for two-
horse power. Always note cata-
logue numbers of the belts you
fit to save trouble in ordering
replacements later.
If longer drives are required

Sowing Lucerne.
“Bogan Joe”: When sowing
lucerne it is unwise to risk a
thin crop through being stingy
with the seed. It’s important for
a permanent crop that a good
stand should be obtained at the
outset. Reseeding cannot be
done effectively without again
breaking up the land, and this
means a year or two lost. If re-
seeding is not done the yields
are low for all time. Sowing
further seed is not satisfactory,
as the young plants have to fight
for a living with vigorous ones
already established.
Seeding should be done only
when conditions are favorable
and on land well prepared.
Heavier application of seed when
the ground is dry will not secure
a proper stand. In regular
lucerne districts of good rainfall
101 b. to 151 b. an acre can be
used, but in dry districts 61b. to
81b. is sufficient. For grazing
purposes in the dry districts 21b.,
and at the most 31b., is ample.
Natural Pastures.
“Prof.”: They probably carry
over 75 p.c. of .Australia’s stock,
and almost the whole wool-clip
is cut from sheep run on them.
Where rainfall is fairly reliable
they can certainly be improved.
Subdivision is the first move. It
gives a paddock a chance to re-
cover and can be worked in such
a way as to give lambing ewes
or dairy cows the best feed when
they need it. Subdivision makes
easier the running of mixed
stock.
Some native perennial grasses
don’t respond to super., but
where annual grasses are domin-
ant upwards of half a bag to
the acre is beneficial. Top re-
sults from such dressings come
from incorporating improved
strains of grasses and clovers in
the sward. In our S.A. district
we found that Dwalganup sub.-
clover (21b. per acre), introduced
when topdressing a natural
wallaby-grass pasture, materially
improved it. Wimmera rye has
been successfully established by
this method. Harrowing to
break up and spread animal
droppings and more evenly dis-
tribute the seed of annual species
is useful.
When it is understood that
five rabbits will damage as much
pasture as one sheep can eat,
the importance of their control
is evident. It is useless im-
proving pastures merely as a
benefit for rabbits.
Hints for the Farm.
“Ben Acre”: A sheep killed
in hot weather should have the
kidneys removed immediately,
taking with them as much fat as
possible. Use the loin and leg
first, as they will not keep long.
Jointed meat, or meat that has
been cut and stacked, will not
keep. Even in a refrigerator,
unless frozen, it will soon go
musty. A practice among
drovers is to hang the meat out.
each night and, very early, wrap
it heavily in a tarpaulin. They
say meat can be kept for a week
in the hottest .weather that way.
“Kalo”: Cows suffering from
any kind of lump or swelling
should be tested for tuberculosis.
If the test is negative, cures can
be attempted. Otherwise much
time and money are often
wasted.
“Moira”: Give calves all the
fresh milk offering, and if any
cream is available stir it in,
either with fresh or separated
milk. When milk is scarce feed
a ration of 21b. of oatmeal
mixed with £lb. of crushed lin-
seed. Pour over it five pints of*
boiling water. Next morning
boil for 10 minutes, then add
five pints of separated milk, half-
teaspoon salt and a tablespoon
of sugar. Test first by giving
small quantity of the mixture,
which should feed one calf all
day. Increase sugar or salt if
thought advisable.
“Girrawheen”; Sore teats
sustained from cuts should be
bathed in a weak solution of a
chlorine disinfectant and after-
wards anointed with a little
glycerine or medicinal paraffin.
“Billjim”: There’s plenty to
da in autumn among poultry.
Check mite by painting roosts
with fuel-oil or 50-50 sump-oil
and kerosene. If stock are in-
tensively housed dig up portion
of the yard and dampen to pro-
vide a dust bath. This will en-
able birds to keep themselves
free of lice. Make certain of
adequate ventilation of houses
and sufficiency of roosts.
“Sarina”: Just as important
as keeping the fowls’ water-tins
in clean condition is keeping the
water cool. The tins should be
set under cover during hot
weather. On a hot day poultry
will perish from thirst rather
than leave a shady place to reach
water. Wooden troughs keep
the water at a much lower
temperature than metal ones,
“C.A.A.”: Bran and pollard
are useful with arsenic as bait
for rabbits. Dissolve two pints
of treacle or honey or 51b. of
sugar in a gallon of hot water
and thoroughly mix 21b. of
arsenic, 101 b. of pollard and
21b. of bran. Mix arsenic, bran
and pollard with the sweetened
water until the mass attains the
consistency of dough. After*
kneading, roll it out until it is
pencil-thick, then cut into small
cubes. Drop in furrows.
“Myrrhee”; What may be
called an autumn spray for cod-
lin-moth is made of a summer
white-oil emulsion, five pints,
with 31b. of arsenate of lead
powder (or 61b. paste) in 100
gallons of water.

Just for that little Roco is
grateful. A smile flashes on his
face, but flees before despair.
Smile at Mr. Spiermont Roco
will not.
“Better piece opposite,” says
the postmaster. He leans for-
ward on the counter, smiles in a
slightly deprecatory manner.
“Of course, you’ll think I’m
speaking for myself, since I own
it.”
Well, so the official does, in
a way, although he pretends not.
He is interested, and considers
himself not a fool at all. His
head leans on one side and he
regards the postmaster.
“But, then,” says the post-
master, “I own both pieces, any-
way.”
This Roco cannot believe.
The official has not heard Mr.
Spiermont, for he is ponder-
ously busy with his own
thoughts.
“Of course we need vegetables
for the school. Cook their own
midday meals, you know.”
There is mild triumph in this
revelation, and his eyes gleam.
He looks triumphantly at Mr.
Spiermont. Roco then puts his
head on one side like an inquir-
ing and doubtful magpie.
“As I say,” says Mr. Spier-
mont. “It’s all the same to me,
one piece or the other. I own
them both.”
Now both the official and
Roco hear him. The official
seems suspicious and looks from
the postmaster to the Italian
and back again. Roco’s eyes
dance afresh with rage.
“My garden!” he shouts.
“Ah,” says the official. He
leans upon his pencil, clasped in
a plump hand.
“His garden,” agrees the post-
master. “My land.” He ex-
plains further. “Usual lease,
you know.” Well, the official
does know. He pencils the in-
formation into the neat stomach
of the small notebook. At the
same moment the postmaster
gives Roco a wink.
Now, that wink Roco can
scarcely believe. Never could
he have credited the man with
it, that man, that oaf, that happy
oaf, oh, never the winker. Only
Roco it is who smiles and winks
at the girls, and Roco has a
sudden revelation of the postal
official winking at girls and
tickling them. Perhaps even
Mrs. Spiermont, eh?
“If you care for a cup of
tea,” says Mr. Spiermont, and
he gestures towards the house.
“Mrs. Spiermont always' has one
about this time.”
“Never drink tea,” the official
mumbles. Then with a faint
smile. “But anything to wet the
old whistle, you know...” and
Mr. Spiermont, being an official
of sorts himself, and having
much to do with officials, does
know.
ROCO cannot believe the
postmaster has taken the
other man away just to lie to
him, and Roco trembles, think-
ing where that lie might end.
True, Mr. Spiermont does own
one block, but the other block
he does not own. Roco shakes
his head until suddenly an idea
strikes him and he is running
down the road, running as
though he might never get there
in time, or get back in time for
that matter.
Even before he gets there yet
another idea strikes him, and so
he picks' a lettuce, selects it care-
fully from all the plants and
knows it to be the largest, the
crispest in leaves, the whitest
and yellowest in heart and the
tenderest of all lettuce. Then he
picks shiny red tomatoes from
the green bushes, and, although
loaded, manages to add a few
long green cucumbers and a
cool white one or two, and all
these he takes to the hut.
The big oaf, he thinks joy-
ously. Then he lifts the hessian
from his bed-frame, straw from
beneath it, a layer of boards,
some more straw, and finally
finds- what he looks for and
places it in a wicker basket,
with, of course, the tomatoes,
lettuce and cucumbers.
As to racing back to the post-
office, he is dubious. It might
shake everything, crush the let-
tuce, bruise the tomatoes and
even smash them, so he runs, his
back bent, his body tensed, his
arms stiff so that the basket is
carried rigidly. At the same
time he would like to laugh and
leap, but a terrible feeling comes
coursing around his heart, and
he thinks Mr. Spiermont might
not be a good enough liar with
a face like his.
Mrs 1 . Spiermont opens the
back door to him, Roco first
places the basket on the ground.
He is tempted to wink at the
postmaster’s wife, decides
against it, Mrs. Spiermont is
well worth winking at, Roco
thinks; and, of course, tick-
ling. But that is Mr. Spier-
mont’s privilege. Roco looks
mysterious, picks up the lettuce
and hands it to Mrs. Spiermont.
She is delighted with the lettuce,
but somewhat mystified. The
tomatoes she also appreciates,
and recognises definite quality in
the cucumbers, but her pretty
forehead wrinkles.
Her eyes go round at the sight
of the dark, dust-covered bottle
which Roco draws from the
heart of the basket. Roco, from
the expression of love and agony
in his eyes, might be withdraw-
ing his own heart, but after a
time he pats the slim neck of
the bottle, rolls' his eyes, pats his
neck and says “For the throat,
eh, yes.”
She is further puzzled when
Roco rolls his eyes more, screws
his face and winks. There is no
doubt about that wink. Mrs.
Spiermont remembers suddenly
the official and the murmured
conversations between the two
men and a mention here and
there of Roco, his vegetables and
his land. The postmaster’s wife
understands. She smiles,
Roco is delighted. He is
tempted to tell Mrs. Spiermont
how to make the lettuce sweet
but not too sweet, sour but not
too sour, and he thinks of
olives, and, with a pang, eschal-
lots he might have brought, but
he decides Mrs, Spiermont will
know what to do, and, looking
at the bottle she holds in her
hands, he thinks that even if she
does not there is still the wine,
and Roco knows wine is its own
servant as well as a master.
He would like to talk a long
time to her, but does not. He
thinks of the postmaster and the
tales he has told him about the
girls, and how he has hit his
chest, time and time again, and
said “I, Roco, I kiss and tickle
the girls. I, Roco, am the
ver-r-ry great lover.”
Mr. Spiermont will, perhaps,
remember all those times. He
thinks, sadly, how very beauti-
ful is this postmaster’s wife.
BUT he goes. Roco goes back
to his vegetable garden,
back to his sharpened spade-
handle and the seedlings which
by now are fairly wilting. He
turns on the sprays and the
water bursts from the pipes,
stutters and bursts again, until
it showers all over the tomatoes
and other vegetables. Roco
then gets to dreaming again,
about the plants he is setting
which will bear red fruit, and
he thinks' how Mr. Spiermont
will enjoy some of it and be
astonished at its smooth perfec-
tion, and he thinks how Mr.
Spiermont must be enjoying wet-
ting his throat, and there is re-
gret only for the fact that the
pot-bellied man is enjoying him-
self, too; but Roco, a phil-
osopher in part and a fatalist in
full, decides nothing can be done
about that.
In the end he decides it is all
for the best and that the post-
master will sell his own block of
land and not Roco’s, and that
Roco might sell his vegetables to
the school, which would be very
good, some of them at least, and
he plunges his piece of wood
and drops in the plant and thinks
how, when it cools, towards
evening, he will gather fifteen
pounds of tomatoes, a half-
bushel case of cucumbers, a let-
tuce or two and even a few
passionfruit, and these he will
place upon his wheelbarrow and
wheel towards Mr. Spiermont’s,
where the postmaster will b e

Frustration.
Byzantine Battie threw down
his brush with the same fine
careless rapture that he threw
paint on to his canvases. Not
for such geniuses as he the
meticulousness, the loving care of
detail as practised by misguided
and despised depictionists who
merely painted what they saw.
Byzantine had early recog-
nised himself as a coming
modernist giant when at art
school; on being requested to
draw a circle freehand, he had
executed something unmistak- •-
ably egg-shaped. His tutor, a
dullard who couldn’t recognise
pure genius when it was there
in front of him, wiped his pupil
off as a hopeless dumbbell. But
Byzantine himself realised im-
mediately that he was gifted be-
yond other men —that his sub-
conscious soul had told him that
the object was elliptical. The
conviction that was to be life-
long with him was bom then:
he must never paint what he saw
but what that mystic inner being
of his told him it saw.
At his first and only exhibi-
tion an afternoon paper had
taken a specially-posed photo of
him in velvet coat, floppy beret
and an enormous tie that he
hoped made him look something
like Matisse or Dali, standing
back admiring one of his own
works. The publicity he got
raised high hopes in him that
he might even sell one of his
canvases, but next day the
prominent art critic of a Great
Daily had praised his show,
rapturously describing one work
as being of an “intense diapered
glubularity in which the linear
mordaciousness was exceeded
only by its adhesive disauthori-
tativeness and obreptive lucu-
lence.”
He had tried his hand at all
the schools, from the cubists
and neo-vorticists to the post-
impressionists and surrealists,
and it was in the latter that he
found the true outlet for his
great talents. He couldn’t spell
any of them, of course—his
ABC had never got him beyond
the ability to write lOU, at
.which from long practice he had
become proficient—but wasn’t
learning to spell just as silly and
unnecessary as learning to draw?
The work he had just com-
pleted would, he felt sure, prove
to be his magnum opus, though
he wasn’t sure what it meant.
None, he was confident, would
be able to interpret it. That
would be the true test of its im-
mortality.
He had painted the picture in
the white heat of inspiration,
following a late supper, with his
friends, of home-brew, curried
prawns and,tripe. He stood back
now and with half-closed eyes
savored the beauties of his
masterpiece.
In the foreground half a
magenta cloud was attached by
a butcher’s hook to a slanting
blue telephone-post that was
being carried along by its green
bats’ wings. Bowing in front
of a headless woman with
elephantiasis-stricken arms, oc-
tagonal hips and baking-dishes
for feet was an eviscerated ani-
mal that resembled vaguely
either a greyhound or a wombat.
In the middle distance an enor-
mous detached eye with a halo
over it jostled half a purple
sunflower, a sewerage pipe and
a crocodile’s head coming up
out of a flowerpot. On what
might have been a railway sig-
nal in the background was bal-
anced a longitudinally-dissected
cow, out of the sides jof which
thrust several radio-valves and
a reel of barbed-wire.
Byzantine was still wonder-
ing whether the National Gal-
lery would insult him by offer-
ing only 300 guineas for it when
his fellow-surrealist Lancelot
Panzye came in. Silently the
genius pointed to his canvas,
and Lancelot stood back, head
on one side, as he gave it criti-
cal appraisal. From time to
time came a low “Masterly!” or
“Superb!” At last Byzantine,
with magnificent confidence, said
“Bet you don’t know what it
represents.”
A moment’s pause ; then came
Lancelot’s high-pitched “I think
I do. It’s Psyche bathing her
feet in the morning dew.”
He had hit it! His master-
piece was a failure! “My God!”
groaned Byzantine, and in his
mortification swallowed a tube
of Prussian blue.
It failed to kill him.
A pity.

A Job for Historians
Recently I stood in the presence of one
of the greatest antiquarian tragedies in
Australia. X was in the vaults of the
Government offices in Hobart, where
stored around me was sufficient un-
touched material to keep half a dozen
historians working for years. The tragedy
is that nothing is being done about it.
Through the zealous persistence of one
man, the material is being preserved from
the worst kind of decay, but the con-
ditions under which it is stored are far
from ideal and a certain process of
deterioration is going on.
These countless documents throwing
vivid, interesting and possibly vital light
on early settlement in Tasmania, N. S.
Wales and Victoria are awaiting the
hands which will bring them to life, while
our histories are being read and written
without benefit of this treasure-store.
Technically, no doubt, the job rests
with the Tasmanian Government, but.
Governments are not conspicuous for
their practical interest in historical origins.
The Hobart Public Library comes into
it partly, and there are others with a
degree of official or private interest. But
the official interest is backed by practi-
cally no money, and enthusiastic private
interest hasn’t any, either.
The immediate need is for an archivist
who could examine and classify the
records and bring to light what does
exist. This means the appointment of a
young but trained man prepared to make
a career of it. Then there is need for
better storage against deterioration and a
system of supervision which, while mak-
ing the material available to scholars,
will guard it from signature-hunters and
souvenir-fiends. One officer has done
devoted work in. protecting the material
against vandals, and in securing some
uniform binding for documents other-
wise thrown haphazardly into the vaults.
But only continuous work by an archi-
vist-historian can do justice to what
exists.
The records date voluminously back to
about 1827, when the colony at Hobart
Town was about 24 years old. From then
until recent and, from the historian’s
viewpoint, less difficult times there is con-
tinuous material. Necessarily it overlaps
with early Sydney, and it predates the
establishment of Melbourne by nearly
10 years, so that there is bound to be
material of first-class interest about each
of those mainland settlements. Of a later
period, the history of whaling alone,
with Hobart Town as its nerve-centre, is
one fascinating chapter.
The Governments of N. S. Wales and
Victoria and the historical societies in
each of those States might take some
direct interest in the proper exploration
and use of these early Tasmanian
archives. Tasmania hasn’t much money
to spare, but the joint appointment of an
archivist by the three States could yield
unpredictable dividends.
While I was down in the vaults I saw
the original pardon, signed in person by
William the Fourth (and a bold and
mighty flourish at that) for one of the
Tolpuddle Martyrs; I also saw the
original pardon, signed by the same
monarch, for William Buckley, the
deserter from the Collins expedition to
Port Phillip in 1803 who turned up more
than 30 years later when Melbourne, was
founded, having been living with the
aborigines in the meantime. Concerning
Melbourne, there was an old charge
against John Batman, shown in Court
records, for having aided and abetted a
challenge to a duel. This occurred in
Tasmania before the momentous move to
the Yarra, but we could not find in the
brief time any record of Court proceed-
ings. John Pascoe Fawkner figured in
several cases of assault and battery, as the
apparent aggressor.
These things are but the odds and
ends. The feeling is irresistible, though,
that the vaults could yield important con-
tributions to Australian history, and it
would be a great tragedy to permit the
present state of affairs to continue. —
Warren Denning (N.S.W.).
Papua-N.G. Capital
On the coastal flats of Papua during
the last fortnight, while waiting for beer
and the nor’-west monsoon to come in,
I realised more than ever what an oppor-
tunity the Minister for these Territories
has to be remembered when his political
philosophy will be well and truly buried
with those who do not work.
The Administrative capital of Papua-
N.G. must be in the highlands, and, be-
ing our permanent territory, the Papuan
highlands are the logical place.
With the Administrative capital—the
commercial capital or centres will look
after themselves —at an altitude of four
to six thousand feet, it would become the
health resort and playground for the
Territories. Any resident in need of a
week-end or more could get it in a
climate equal to that of the Blue Moun-
tains of N. S. Wales.—MacAle (Papua).
Military Training
Reports were recently published that
the Government was considering the in-
troduction of compulsory military train-
ing and that the Minister for the Army
was about to discuss the question with
military leaders. The Minister nearly
burst a blood-vessel in his haste to defend
the reputation of the Government by
denying the foul suggestion.
There seems to be no limit to the lies
the capitalist press is prepared to print
about the Chifley Government. Just be-
cause it is prepared to compel Australians
to bank with the Government bank, to
subsidise the New Zealand socialists to
the tune of several millions through the
“cheap-wheat” plan, to compel a small
musical society to travel by the Govern-
ment airline and a few defenceless girls
to give up congenial employment abroad,
“ You’ll really have to do something about that BULGE of yours, Harry!”
and is preparing plans to compel citizens
to belong to a trade-union (i.e., to sub-
scribe willy-nilly to “Labor” funds) let
no one imagine that it is prepared to do
anything serious about the defence of the
country. *>
Certainly nothing so odious to “Labor
principles” as the compulsion of free
Australians to defend it.
Why should it? Haven’t we got Our
Foreign Policy, to say nothing of the
Little Nations whose leader Our Foreign
Policy has said we are? —F. C. S, (Vic).
Civil Defence
The writer is an old A.I.F. commander:
Since Hiroshima and Bikini the world’s press
has pictured the devastation that will result
from atomic and bacterial missiles of increased
range and power and improved technique under
World War 111 conditions. According to Mr.
Attlee, Britain is studying the problem defen-
sively and offensively.
Tojo recently admitted he would repeat Pearl
Harbor if necessary. An Admiralty official
hinted at “using atomic-driven carriers loosing
guided missiles with atomic warheads as atom-
raiders.” The Commmonwealth Government
has given no indication as to how it intends
to deal with such attacks, which are quite
possible, although Australia is off the main
intensive war zone at present.
In World War II a splendid body of 300,000
men and women gave time and labor to the
study of the implications of unexploded and
exploded bombs (h.e. and incendiary) and
other missiles, as well as learning rescue work,
putting out fires, lighting-control and other
duties in the Civil Defence organisation. Prob-
ably their greatest contributions were in main-
taining dviliaa morale, detecting fifth-column
activities, reporting suspicious happenings and
the movement of aircraft, all done without osten-
tation or pay. If an invasion by sea or air had
occurred, they would have given a good account
of themselves, as did those whom Mr. Churchill
thanked for “saving London and other cities
from being burnt to ashes.”
Patrolling wardens created a feeling of secu-
rity among householders whose menfolk were
on service. The keeping-up of morale means
the difference between defeat and victory.
C.D. is designed, not merely to attend the
dead and injured and to quell fires and repair
damage, but to keep up production of munitions
and food and ensure that the national life pro-
ceeds at increased tempo, with morale main-
tained, the will to win and the aggressive spirit
developed, regardless of setbacks, casualties and
disappointments, and tendencies towards a nega-
tive or passive attitude resisted.
In total war soldiers, seamen, airmen and
civilians are in it, boots and all. The closest
tie-up with the armed services is needed, with
mutual trust, rapid interchange of information
and complete co-operation.
In Britain, America, Germany and Russia
these ideals were achieved. Skeleton C.D.
organisations with planning sections are still
maintained, as a component of the general
defence scheme. For some reason the Com-
monwealth precipitately sacked its C.D. people,
and has so far organised no substitute force.
Total war is largely a war of nerves, to
reduce efficiency and production by creating
doubts and fears. If civilians are taught what
to expect and how to act they will not panic
in a blitz. A wholesome fear is not a bad
thing to rouse the lazy and complacent. C.D.
combats a false sense of security which lulls
people into a state of complacency.
In 1901 we federated principally to attain
uniformity in defence control and doctrine, yet
in World War II the essential C.D. component
was handed to the six States and Canberra,
which each developed its own individual ideas
within its borders without a national control
system. Anomalies resulted, and the same thing
had a vastly different meaning in each State.
Communications were labored and ponderous,
with a tragic time lag. For example, instead of
decisions affecting blackouts in various localities
reposing in R.A.A.F. Fighter Sector personnel,
who normally get early and accurate information
of threatened raids, this function was allotted
to other authorities who received the facts by
circuitous route and were less favorably placed
to decide the action required. A most serious
feature affecting the very essence of the war
effort was the queer practice of causing key
and other workers to cease their task and
proceed to shelters every time an enemy air-
craft was reported off the coast, thus playing
the very game the enemy desired. Again there
was no proper system of reinforcement in men
and equipment of a threatened town by per-
sonnel from other areas.
In Queensland’s wood-built coastal towns a
heavy incendiary attack would have burnt every
house to the ground, as the small local C.D.
body was inadequate for the task.
Such vital equipment as fire-hose unions
were not interchangeable between the States,
and in fact within the State in some cases.
The modern bomber is capable of reaching
Australia from Asia in a matter of hours.
Declarations of war prior to attack are out of
date. The C.D. organisation must therefore be
trained to deal with enemy attacks during peace.
Whether this country adopts compulsory
military training or relies on the proven expen-
sive and inefficient volunteer system, C.D. is
vital to our existence. Personnel unfit for the
fighting services could be enrolled and. trained
in C.D. work. In Britain highly mobile
columns, manned and equipped for instant
action and movement by air, rail or road,
proved their worth. They were maintained on
a permanent nucleus basis and acted as a train-
ing cadre for part-time personnel, like regular
fire-brigades.
Australia’s vast wealth of forests, growing
crops, orchards, pastures, herds, woolsheds,
apart from city installations, factories, etc., is
extremely vulnerable to incendiary attack. A
C.D. organisation should again be set up
using many of the old personnel, reinforced
by younger men and women, and there should
be representation on the defence committee,
and at every level of command.
The best advice available from Britain should
be obtained. Uniforms and the normal means
of protection should be provided.
In view of recent happenings the whole nation
should be living in a state of readiness for
war, including war against anti-British elements
in our midst. We should be already train-
ing or re-training C.D. personnel, otherwise
we may suffer like the people of London,
Berlin and Hiroshima. —T. W. (N.S.W.).
Rails and Airways
The Association of American Rail-
roads represents the largest organisation
of carriers in the world, almost the last
of its type to operate under genuine
private enterprise, and it has been fight-
ing for some time for the right to engage
ip air operations. At a hearing of the
President’s Air Policy Commission, coun-
sel- for the association had some hard
things to say;
It was grossly unfair and contrary to the
American system of free competitive enter-
prise to refuse to allow railroads to enter
the air-transport field just because they
were large surface carriers, pie railroads
were making no war on airline operation
or development, but they were protesting
strongly against continuation of the policy
of wholesale subsidisation of the air
carriers out of funds to which the railroads
themselves were large contributors.
To bring about fairness in the competitive
struggle each form of transport must stand
on its own feet with no help from the pub-
lic purse. If a particular form of transport
cannot survive without Government subsi-
dies there is obviously something wrong
with its management or its endeavors. The
air industry is more than 20 years old. It
has attained the stature of a giant. Its
days of being pampered and coddled should
be terminated. If it cannot now stand alone
it probably never will. It should be made
to pay its own way by meeting its own
operating expenses, maintaining its own air-
ways, paying proper rentals for Govern-
ment-constructed airfields and facilities,
carrying on its own research and safety-
producing projects, just as do the railroads
and the pipelines.
I can’t see any fair-minded person tak-
ing exception to that argument, which
merely bears out what I’ve maintained all
along. Ensure that all forms of trans-
port pay their way in full and you’ll have
none of the present transport problems to
which nobody appears to know the
answer. Neither, for that matter, would
you have any air transport worth men-
tioning.—Transporticus (Singapore).
Navy Warrant-officers
The R.A.N. is finding it hard to per-
suade ratings to qualify for warrant rank.
The naval w.-o. is a peculiar species—
though senior to his opposite numbers in
Army and Air Force and entitled to a
salute and “sir,” he is not commissioned.
On a frigate recently in full commission
the gunnery-control officer, armament-
stores officer, navigator and .engineer
officer were w.-os. —which meant, in effect,
that these obviously important duties
were being performed by non-commis-
sioned officers. They lived in the ward-
room on precisely the same terms as the
remaining ship’s officers, yet if drafted to
a shore depot or cruiser would have
been segregated in their own mess.
During the war there were warrant-
officers with 20 years’ experience whose
time on their w.-o’s. course exceeded the
total time reserve sub-lieutenants had in
the Navy. The sub. was still senior.
To qualify for warrant rank a “Higher
Educational Test,” on a par with the
Leaving, must be passed. Though the
Navy provides basic instruction on the
candidate’s technical subject—engineer-
ing, wireless, gunnery, etc. —the rest of
his education is left to him and there is
not much time for it on a seagoing ship
while carrying out normal duties.
Naval warrant rank is a relic from
sailing days. If the Navy wishes to
advance officers from the lower-deck,
with all a rating’s invaluable knowledge
and experience, it should offer him full
commissioned rank, and not something
half-way between.—C. A. M, (N.S.W.).
The Countryman
Cities, no doubt, have their advantages,
but country people who go there on
holidays are soon full to the teeth with
the round of theatres, cafes and society,
and long for the few hundred acres bora
of their sweat and the contentment which
comes with completing a hard day’s work.
The countryman knows the views from
the hills on his land; he knows the
reasons for the varying colors of his pad-
docks ; he knows what lies beyond the
next valley ; but his knowledge does not
detract from his appreciation of their
beauty.
Through the years this inherent love
of nature has given the countryman a
serenity which refuses to be bothered
with many of the ideas born in the dust
and smoke of cities. His standard of use-
fulness is generally unknown to the city-
dweller. He wears a hat to keep the sun
or rain off his head ; clothes to keep him
warm, and not to follow the variations
of some fashion ; so thq condition of his
mind is rarely based on his appearance
and where he lives, but rather on the
good he does for the community and his
inward satisfaction with life. His are
true values.
Australia is still producing its country-
men, and will continue to do so until a
growing population forces them to be-
come city- or suburban-dwellers. Then
we will need to be careful. Then, perhaps,
scatterbrained “isms” and useless catch-
words will mould the standard of life. In
the meantime we may realise what the
men on the land have done for the
country. Their viewpoint may be con-
stricted, it may be narrow, but it is gener-
ally deeper and more abiding than one
which changes for a passing need.—
J.A.A. (Vic.),


Cattle
The fears of “Outback” (B. 17/12/’47)
and other writers for the future of the
cattle industry and Australia’s ability to
supply the export market are a very dif-
ferent cry from that of the ’twenties and
’thirties, when meat could scarcely be sold
and certainly not at a profitable price.
Where the country was at all suitable,
stations changed to sheep.
The large cattle-breeding stations,
which are the backbone of the beef in-
dustry, are mostly in the north —Arn-
hem Land, the Gulf country of Queens-
land and the Cape York Peninsula. They
are adequate and reliable rainfall areas,
but mostly forest country. The trees
take the nourishment from the soil and
only coarser grasses grow. There must'
be a vast programme of ringbarking to
give herbage and filter grasses a chance.
We must not, of course, ring everything
as we have done in parts of the south;
but the fine dairy land in Victoria, worth
£5O to £lOO per acre, was almost worth-
less till ringed and cleared.
Ringbarking in the north must be
carried out in the “wet” from January
till end of March, when the sap is up
and there will be 90 per cent, kill and
no suckering. It is surprising how quickly
the finer grasses and herbage come when
the trees are killed. The process can be
helped by broadcasting seed such as
Townsville lucerne (Stylosanthes Sun-
diaca), which spreads quickly and is a
great fattener.
About 20 years ago a police patrol
visited Aurukun Mission on the west side
of Cape York Peninsula. It was a dry
time and the patrol’s horse-feed con-
tained seed of Townsville lucerne.
The horses spread the seed about pad-
docks and it soon grew where trees had
been rung or paddocks cleared. It has
since kept the mission dairy herd fat
the year round.
A big ringbarking programme needs
labor. There is a fair pool of it on the
aboriginal missions, and the work comes
at a time when there is little labor re-
quired on stations or by pearling fleets.
If the Government could obtain the use
of 50,000 Japs on an indenture basis as
part of reparations it would be a big
lift to the north. There will not be much
of a cattle industry in those parts with-
out mass-killing of trees.
At present the north is only fit for
breeding. Young bullocks have to be
travelled about 1000 miles south for
fattening-off, and another 1000 miles by
road and rail to meatworks. After all
the costs are paid there isn’t much left for
the grower. With extensive ringbarking
and the introduction of better grasses,
cattle could be grown and fattened on
the stations, killed at meatworks reason-
ably near, and shipped direct to the U.K.
—Alpha (8.C.0.F., Japan).
Water-conservation
During the last 18 months I have
travelled extensively over N. S. Wales and
Victoria and have been appalled by the
lack of water-conservation. Sufficient rain
falls to replenish existing tanks indefi-
nitely, but there are not nearly enough
tanks, and there has been no worthwhile
effort to catch the frequent showers that
run to waste. Almost every property
has a place where water could be retained
merely by building a suitable earth wall
reinforced by grass and creepers.
The expense of suitable earth-mdving
equipment is usually a barrier to more
extensive conservation, but now, with
almost every mile of every road under-
going maintenance or due for attention,
there is a solution to the problem, Bull-
dozers are often used for major repairs
and, for economical operation, they
should be working 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. As it is, about 100 work-
hours per machine are lost to the com-
munity every week, although often within
100 yards of where the ’dozers stand
overnight and through the long week-end,
there is a site for a large tank. One
machine alone could throw up a good-
sized tank in two or three nights. Most
cockies would willingly pay the wages.
The Conservation Commission* could
assist in educating the different bodies
who have bulldozers, scoops and graders
standing idle. After one year of this
impromptu conservation the benefit would
be enormous ; 10 years would double the
amount of water conserved today.—
Buster (N.S.W.).
Wattle-bark
Australia imports 90 per cent, of its
wattle-bark, mainly from South Africa.
Ironically, this South African bark is
grown from seeds sent from Australia
about 30 years ago. Surely we should
be able to grow at least enough to supply
our own needs, if not for an export trade.
In coastal areas where wattles thrive
there are thousands of acres, worthless
for grazing or agriculture, but well suited
to wattle. On the South Coast of N. S.
Wales there are dozens of dairyfarms
with clumps of self-sown wattle-trees.
Every couple of years farmers strip the
trees and market the bark, earning a hand-
some cheque for their sideline to dairy-
ing. Most of these farmers have at least
10 acres of country which could be made
into a wattle plantation. The cost would
be small, the wattle would need little
attention beyond pruning and thinning
out, and after a few years the return
would be handsome —wattle-bark has
always been a good price, and there is
always a ready market for it.—W. P. T.
(N.S.W.).
Pensions
“8.R.” (B. 18/2/’4B) apparently knows
little about the provisions of the Social
Services Act. Assuming that he gives
the complete details of property and
income, the man and his wife are entitled
to an age pension of 19s. a week each.
This is how it is calculated. For pen-
sions purposes income and property of
husband and wife are halved. “B.R.’s”
friend has an income of £1 10s. a week
(half his superannuation cheque) and
property valued at £275 (half the £550
bank account). Section 28 of the Act
provides that the full pensionr shall be
reduced by the amount by wj}ich the in-
come exceeds £52 p.a. In this case, that
is £26, so the full pension of £97 10s.
p.a. is reduced by £26, leaving £7l 10s.
a year.
The same section also provides that the
pension shall be reduced by £1 p.a. for
"It's a stupid place to build a house, anyway !”
every complete £lO of property in excess
of £5O. “B.R.’s” friend therefore loses
£1 for each complete £lO in excess of
£225 (£275 less £5O), or £22 p.a. This
deducted from £7l 10s. leaves an annual
pension of £49 10s., pay able to both hus-
band and wife, the calculation being the
same in each case.
Anyone receiving a small superannua-
tion or retiring allowance should consult
an officer of the Pensions Department. I
have seen many cases where retired
people have lost many pounds simply be-
cause some Johnny-in-the-street told
them they were not entitled to a Federal
pension. The house in which an appli-
cant lives is not classed as “property,”
irrespective of its value, nor are furniture
and personal effects. Macßopus
(N.S.W.).
My old friend, having exhausted his
savings, decided to apply for the pension
and asked me to help him with the forms.
First glance at the long questionnaire
had scared him stiff, but the “Statutory
Declaration,” with its threatened pains
and penalties, lost all its terrors when
gone into in detail.
Then came the “personal interview”
with the Special Magistrate. Again the
old chap got the jitters, evidently expect-
ing something in the nature of a third-
degree grilling. When I met him the
following day he was smiling all over.
He had been dealt with punctually,
speedily and courteously. The only new
question he had been asked was whether
he wanted to collect the cash or have it
delivered by mail. Two dayS later he
received the first cheque he had ever got
for nothing in his life, and could scarcely
believe there was no catch in it.
Of course he has earned every penny
of the pension during a lifetime of honest
toil, and it is cheering to know that he,
with thousands of his kind, are receiving
some reward for their labor just when
they need it most. — Civil Service (S.A.).
Education
I am only 14 and therefore not sup-
posed to know much, but I’d like to point
out that the average present-day lad of
my age is more intelligent and sophisti-
cated than was his counterpart of 50 years
ago.
In these days a young fellow has a
chance to learn a good deal of mechanics,
to read more serious literature and to see
“general exhibition” films. His mental
development is thus fairly rapid. Yet the
Government apparently thinks that a boy
of 14 is too young to enter a trade, and he
is pushed back to school at the very time
when he is anxious to learn his future
calling,
J’ve read books and seen pictures of
the wonderful craftsmanship of the Vic-
torian era, and I know that in those
days boys were apprenticed at an early
age, that they often boarded with their
expert employers and that they learned
their trade the hard way—but with the
best results.
Nowadays boys are tempted into dead-
end jobs by high wages and other in-
ducements. This might be all right for
the present, but it means that good crafts-
manship is going to pot and in the near
future we won’t have a decent article
in our homes.—B. Y. (N.S.W.).
Landlord and Tenant
A man who wins a lottery does not
have to pay tax on it because the ticket
has already been subject to taxation, yet
anyone who invests his life’s savings
from his income (already taxed) in build-
ing a house to let finds that his profits,
if any, are taxed again as “unearned
income.”
In these days of soaring costs it is im-
possible for a landlord to grow fat at
the expense of his tenant, who is, rightly,
protected by a Fair Rents Board. The
eviction laws are made for the unprin-
cipled tenant —few owners wish to evict
a good one, with sound reason.
Owning a house to let is a mug ? s game,
as the Housing Commission will soon find
out at the taxpayer’s expense. — On-
looker (Vic.).
Specialists
The university graduates who came into
the forces to do a certain job (B. 25/2/’4B)
knew littldPor nothing of soldiering. On
the other hand very few real soldiers,
sailors or airmen knew anything about
the former’s specialised job. When we
were at an A.G.H. in New Guinea we
were sometimes short of dispensers and
accepted the situation because we were
told there was a shortage of them. Im-
agine our feelings when we learned,
months later, that during this time there
were several on the mainland at an
A.A.M.C. Training Wing being taught to
be soldiers.
Specialists should have been enlisted
without any rank and then there would
never have been the necessity of their
taking parades, etc. Some C.Os. seemed
to delight in seeing such officers and
n.c.os. make fools of themselves by com-
pelling them to take parades.
In the next show doctors and technical
specialists should not be given any rank
or authority over the men in their unit,
but should have executive officers to look
after the administrative side, leaving them
to their technical duties. In the last war
we found women’s and children’s special-
ists as C.Os. of units. These would have
done a better job at home looking after
the civilian population than playing at
soldiers. It was ridiculous for, say, a
doctor-colonel to rank higher than a
major in an infantry show. —R. W.
(N.S.W.) _____
National Health
Despite the achievements of medical
science statistics show there has been no
appreciable change in the average span
of life. Premium rates charged by life-
insurance offices endorse this fact —the
rates have not changed to any extent
during the last 100 years, though keen
competition would enforce reduction if
such were feasible.
It seems obvious that other forms of
disease are replacing those arrested by
modern methods; organic troubles are
being superseded by the more insidious
diseases of the nervous system. Former
dread scourges of pneumonia, malaria,
and even cancer and tuberculosis, have
been checked, but mental illnesses are in-
creasing, and are largely responsible for
lowering the standard of- our national
health.
Dr. Idris Morgan, of Newcastle
(N.S.W.), told a health inspectors’ confer-
ence that one person in every 250 in
Australia is insane, and that 20 per cent,
are suffering from some form of mental
illness. He added that a great majority
of such cases were curable. The chief
deterrent to treatment is the hush-hush
policy adopted by many who suffer in
silence, or by relatives who regard
such diseases as a stigma. Dr. Morgan
stated that “many of our best men in all
walks of life have died before their time.”
Any layman could supply lists of
contributing causey —such as financial
worry, industrial unrest, city noises,
erratic meals, transport discomforts, holi-
day difficulties, lack of rest, domestic
strife and a thousand and one other irri-
tants.
Nerve complaints will continue to in-
crease unless some drastic change is
effected. City congestion is'probably a
contributing factor, and rmich could be
accomplished by decentralisation. There
is, however, an urgent need for a new
attitude towards “mental illness”—the
word “lunacy” should be eradicated.
That all nerve ailments can be re-
lieved or cured should be publicised as
‘widely as possible. Doctors are able to
give medical aid, but they sio not adver-
tise the fact, so the necessary propaganda
will have to be launched on their behalf.
—C. E. T. (N.S.W.).
The Root of the Matter
“Waddlin’ Willie” (B. 11/2/’4B) says
that “the dinkum soldier will never join
the perms” because of the slow and in-
active routine, and because adventure
beckons more from civilian life. What
does he term a “dinkum soldier”? One
who has served at Tobruk, Shaggy Ridge
or Balikpapan? If he believes that cam-
paigns make soldiers it is time he thought
again. Soldiers, be they Old Contemp-
tibles, A.I.F. or militia, are made in the
barrack square and company bullring.
The firmer the discipline while training
and the more thorough the bullring in-
struction, the more reliable the soldier.
If we ensure that our Army setup is
ready to train recruits, whether they be
“sick of the humdrum Australian life”
or not, they will not be found wanting :
Diggers never have been. — Vacco (Q.).
Some primitive forms of life multiply
themselves by giving off cells which break
into more cells, which break into more
cells, and so on, ad infinitum. State
Premiers, especially those “Labor” ones
that baited their election hooks, are dis-
covering that the 40-hour week is gifted
with the same extraordinary power in the
matter of costs, which keep on growing
and creating more costs, ad infinitum.
And they can do nothing about it. —
M. H. S. (N.S.W.).
It’s a favorite contention of these State
Railway Ministers and Commissioners that
their insolvent railways are “the property
of the people” and run for the people ;
thedbfore private motor and air transport
mustn’t be allowed to compete against
them. The Queensland railway strike has
blown that out. Not only was Queens-
land left to depend on road and air trans-
port for very life, but-the A.R.U. gave
orders that no goods for Queensland
should be carried on the N.S.W. rail-
ways. And what it said Went. — Border
Liner (Q.).
Cal well intends to visit the American-
-Australian scientific expedition in Arnhem
Land next August. Anyone know whether
he will go as (1) Minister of Information
seeking information, (2) as Minister of
Immigration seeking migrants, or (3) as
“Labor” member seeking a change of
scene and air at other people’s expense?
—Jim (Vic.).
Czech (or Prague) farmers were photo-
graphed demonstrating in favor of the
Communist Minister of Agriculture, who
“has promised each farmer 120 acres and
a tractor.” It would be interesting to see
their demonstration when he sends the
commissars around to collect the harvest.
—B. J. J. (S.A.).
Two years ago the small firm I work
for was in danger of closing down
absenteeism, combined with a go-slow
policy, had crippled it. The manager
called the men together and, after ex-
plaining the position, outlined a bonus
system that would benefit any man wil-
ling to work. Today production has in-
creased 300 per cent., wages have doubled
and, there is no absenteeism to speak of.
Agitators shirkers have long since
given the game away for more fruitful
fields, and this month the firm announced
it was open for further orders. Moral?
Pay men according to the work they do
and the production bogey will be a thing
of the past.— Vesab (S.A.).

Progress through STEEL
This dynamically styled South
Australian Railways’ locomotive typifies
the progress attained in Australian
rolling stock design and construction.
It is capable of 70 miles per hour
with a load of 500 tons.
Steel is the train travellers best friend. With iron it has made possible the evol-
ution of rail transportation to its present state of service and reliability.
The puffing billy” of the early 1880’s contrasts greatly with today’s air-conditioned inter-
state expresses hauled by such powerful streamlined locomotives as illustrated above.
Australian steel has made possible the transformation. It has been utilised in the building
of bigger and better locomotives and electric trains. It has gone into axles and wheels,
fd
carriage frames, many and varied engine components, bridges
and viaducts, signal and control apparatus, and thousands of
miles of rail tracks, vital arteries serving the nation’s primary
and secondary industries.
