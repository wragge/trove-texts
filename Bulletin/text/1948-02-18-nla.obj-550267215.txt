ELGIN CATHEDRAL, oNE OF BRITAIN'S MOST IMPRESSIVE RUINS
pride of Elgin is its world-famed cathedral. Founded
in 1224 it suffered badly from fire in 1244, and again in
1270, but these misfortunes led to its being built bigger and better
until, with its magnificent entrance and western towers, it became
“the glory of the whole land.” In 1390 it suffered again from
fire, this time caused by the Earl bf Buchan, Alexander Stewart,
known as “the Wolf of Badenoch” and “his wyld, wykked Helan-
men.” The earl was made to bear part of the restoration costs
and the grand building then enjoyed a century of peace. Then
came the Reformation and Elgin cathedral lost its leaden roofings.
Left unprotected, the cathedral fell into disrepair. On Easter
Sunday, 1711, the great central tower crashed down upon nave
and transepts. The clearing of the rubble was begun by one John
Shanks and continued by the Crown authorities through the
exertions of Isadc Forsyth, The ground plan of the building has
been unearthed and, of the structures still standing enough remains
to make Elgin cathedral one of the Empire’s most imposing
ecclesiastical monuments. The portions which have survived include
the western towers and principal entrance, St. Mary’s Aisle and
the Chapterhouse. * ,

ANSWER TO CENSORS.
Eric Partridge’s Shakspeare’s Bawdy
(Routledge) is not so much a book as an
explosion.
It is, first of all, explosive in style. Mr.
Partridge, a learned grammarian but a
curiously irascible manipulator of prose
rhythms, is so anxious not to sound
“academic” that he writes in a series of
barks: —
Throughout his writings, as obviously in
his life, Shakspeare reveals, occasionally
in an explicit, generally in an implicit way,
that in his spirit, his mind, his emotions,
he strove- to reconcile those opposites which,
in fact (as sometimes he perceived), made
him “the myriad-minded,” the universal-
spirited, the catholic-emotioned man he so
dazzlingly, so movingly, was in life and in
print. \
And then, even when he is not directly
dealing with his central theme of Shak-
speare’s bawdiness, Mr, Partridge is
always provocative;
Shakspeare is, beyond question, as in-
dubitably the world’s greatest; wit as he is
the world’s greatest writer: to that wit*
justice has never been adequately rendered.
As a dramatic wit, he surpasses Etherege,
Wycherley, Congreve and the best French
writers of comedy in the 18th Century;
as an intellectual or a Society wit he goes
far beyond the powers of Lamb, Jerrold,
Wilde, Shaw; as a comic wit (a wit in the
widest, furthest-ranging implications of the
word) he has never been approached.
Mr. Partridge knows what he is talk-
ing about, and he documents his case ;
but Bernard Shaw, at any rate, would
undoubtedly find that particular assertion
provoking.
Again, when he is approaching .his
central theme, Mr. Partridge continues to
be challenging, both in his literary re-
searches and in his manner of discussing
them: “But then Keats as well as Byron,
Tennyson as .well as Swinburne, had dirty
minds.” »
It should be explained at this point,
perhaps, that Mr. Partridge is not re-
proving Keats and Tennyson for their
“dirty” minds. He. is noting a fact, as
he notes also that there is “dirt” in
Spenser and in Milton, and he is chal-
lenging *the puritan to admit that what
he—the puritan—would call “dirt” is to
be found in all these great writers. As
to Shakspeare’s “dirt,” Mr. Partridge
rightly regards it as “profound”:
In him, erotic wit often became so
penetrating, so profound, so brilliant that
it would make us forget the eroticism, were
it not that the eroticism itself is penetra-
ting and profound; and certainly the degree
of wit renders the eroticism aseptic and—
• except to prudes and prurierits—innocuous.
It is, of course, in its central theme
that Shakspeare’s Bawdy is most ex-
plosive. In the long introductory essay
which precedes the glossary that makes
the bulk of the book, Mr. Partridge is
positively startling in claiming not merely
that Shakspeare is occasionally indelicate
—which everybody knows —but that he
is the bawdiest of all English playwrights:
How, in this matter of sex and bawdiness,
does Shakspeare compare with other
Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists? With
the Restoration playwrights? And with
those who come later?
Of all the dramatists flourishing in the
Elizabethan and Jacobean periods, Shaks-
peare is the wittiest, profoundest, most
idealistic, yet most cynical, and, proportion-
ally to the corpora operum, the most abun-
dant: Lyly, Marlowe, Kyd, Greene—Ben
Jonson, , Webster, Tourneur, Heywood,
Dekker, Massinger, Middleton, Beaumont
and Fletcher: all these men are inferior,
in all those respects, to Shakspeare, and
only Jonson in his comedies and Beaumont
and Fletcher, whether in comedy or tragi-
comedy, are as smutty....
The Restoration dramatists, Dryden,
Etherege, Wycherley, Otway, Congreve,
Farquhar, are, in their sexual repartees,
often nearly as witty and almost as abun-
dant, but never so profound, rarely so
audaciously objective as Shakspeare; and
only Wycherley is equally scabrous As
for the post-1720 dramatists in England,
I need only say that none of them has
been so free, so liberal, as Shakspeare; no,
not even the most daring and self-expressive,
even at their most nasty (for* at least two
ot them are nasty in a rather underigraduate
and unknown-to-woman way).
One could carry these comparisons
further. The total of Shakspeare’s bawdi-
ness must, for instance, far exceed that
of Fielding, who is probably the frankest
of English novelists, so that a reasonable
claim could be made for Shakspeare’s
pre-eminence in this respect in English
writing as a whole. And, as Mr. Part-
ridge pertinently observes, even the trans-
lators of Rabelais .were pearly under the
playwright’s influence.
But without further comparisons, the
point as to wealth of im-
propriety is sufficiently established; and
this, convincingly argued in the essay, is
arithmetically demonstrated in the glos-
sary, where Mr. Partridge lists no fewer
than 1398 “unprintable” or “doubtful”
terms from ‘Shakspeare’s plays.
It is true that the world is not accus-
tomed to think of Shakspeare as a lewd
or shocking author. This is partly due
to the fact that his mind was so admirably
balanced (hat no single aspect of life was
given undue emphasis in his plays. If
he writes of love, he writes also of hate
and envy and ambition and greed—all
the great passions that move men to
dangerous action. If sex inspired some
of his loveliest'poetry, so did the English
countryside. And, within the balanced
universe of his mind, his outlook on sex
itself was balanced. His bawdiness, says
Partridge, is “broad, ribald, healthily
coarse, unsqueamishly natural and un-
affectedly humorous.”
But it isr also true that the world has,
as Partridge asserts, evaded consideration
of Shakspeare’s bawdiness. There is a
conspiracy of silence on the subject, and
this # conspiracy Mr. Partridge is deter-
mined to challenge:
Quotations could be adduced for every
shade of that elastic word love, from in-
cipient liking to all-pervasive adoration,
devotion, desire: from bestial appetite,
through hearty lusts and vagrant letches,
to night-ethereal, starry loves of the most
spiritual sort. The lowest, Shakspeare,
endowed with an awe-inspiring degree of
sympathy and perception, could under-
stand; honest lust, fugitive libidos, and
ordinary love (half sensuality, half sub-
limation) he knew in his own life; superior
love, true love, was what he himself was
also capable of —and what he aspired
to
The subject has never been more than
skimmed, which is an astounding omission
on the part of British and American critics
and scholars: for, of all English-speaking
writers, indeed of all poets, dramatists,
novelists whatsoever, Shakspeare has dealt
the most profoundly and the most spiritu-
ally (he out-Dante’s Dante), the most
lyrically (bettering even Meredith’s “Love
in the Valley”), the most sympathetically,
the most humorously, the most materialis-
tically and cynically, and, above all, the
most comprehensively and comprehend-
ingly, with that passion and that affection,
that alter-egoing and that sublimation, that
selfishness and selflessness, which are: love.
Except for this paragraph, which occurs
in the glossary, Mr. Partridge is not
directly concerned with Shakspeare’s out-
look on love. That great and neglected
theme—how seldom, compared to the
comparatively tepid “Merchant of
Venice,” is “Anthony ,and Cleopatra”
staged or discussed!—is reserved, he says,
for another day. But the present volume
nevertheless challenges the conspiracy of
silence on that theme as well as on simple
bawdiness ; and on both counts the book
is as valuable as it is courageous.
At its most significant, Shakspeare’s
Bawdy provides a fresh understanding of
Shakspeare, and so of all literature, and
so of life. It is a defence of human
freedom-. At a lower, but more prac-
tical level, it should prove extraordinarily
effective as a weapon against the censor-
ship of literature. The argument that
there are “obscenities” in Shakspeare has
frequently been used in courts of law in
defence of some contemporary book that
has offended the illiterate, but without
Shakspeare’s Bawdy for reference it would
be difficult to present the argument in its
full weight. Mr. Partridge, with his wise
and learned essay and .with his compre-
hensive glossary, might well provide a
lawyer with ammunition of unexampled
power. He wffi certainly provide any
author who has been banned, any author
likely to be banned (as are all authors
in Australia), all men who love books
and all men who hate injustice, with
ample reason for exploding.
No wowser or policeman, however
earnestly he hunts, will find 1398 bawdy
expressions in Ulysses, Redheap or We
Were the Rats. And any judge or poli-
tician, after reading' Shakspeare’s Bawdy,
must admit that while Shakspeare con-
tinues to be printed—and who would
dare to suggest censoring Shakspeare?—
it is unjust to ban any work less bawdy
than his plays. If the law makes this
injustice possible, then the law is plainly
ridiculous and ought to be changed. And
if the law were changed so that, in the
only tolerable form censorship could take,
the author’s intention could be examined,
as to whether it was pornographic or
healthily or profoundly bawdy in the
Shakspearean sense, Ulysses, Redheap
and We Were the Rats would be placed,
beyond doubt, in the category of the
healthy and the profound.
From Another World.
Alfred Noyes’s Portrait of Horace
(Sheed and Ward) is like a breath from
another world, like a ghostly echo of
the music of the spheres: gentle, humane,
scholarly, civilised and ineffably remote :
They took their evening meal in a green
arbor outside. We can picture that scene—
the amphora, and the wine-cups on the
httle tables; Maecenas, acting as a genial
chairman, and turning to Heliodorus, as if
he were a Greek encyclopedia, to confirm a
fact or compl, .e a quotation; Varius and
Plotius discussing the possibilities of the
Roman theatre; and, in the real centre,
wherever they might happen to be sitting,
■ Virgil and Horace.
Remote though it is, Noyes’s world has
its value and its charm. When he is
defending Horace against the absurd as-
persions cast upon him for his humble
origin, when he is searching the Italian
landscape for the original fountain of
Bandusia, when he is reproving earlier
critics for what he believes to be their
errors of taste or understanding, catching
even Saintsbury in a “major blunder,”
and when he is discussing the subtleties
of satire in the reference to eye-ointment
in the lines
Hie oculis ego nigra meis collyria lippus
illinere,
Noyes is a model of urbanity, as pleas-
ing in style as he is temperate in argu-
ment and meticulous in criticism.
And, in one sense, it is the present
generation, unacquainted with the classics,
not Alfred Noyes, that is remote from
realities. What the schools have lost by
the murder of Greek and the slow strangu-
lation of Latin is not merely their ac-
quaintance with the. excellent word
“mensa,” a table, but Euripides and Virgil,
the cultural birthright of European civi-
lisation. Since education, free, secular
and compulsory, became also commercial,
and turned away from the ideal of culti-
vating the mind, it has cut off civilisation
at its roots. Nations, that lose the sense
of the continuity of history and the con-
tinuity of the life of the mind, reflected
in classic literature, walk the earth as
strangers and barbarians.
But Alfred Noyes is too distant and
too refined to make Horace live again for
a wide audience. Also his biography is
too sentimental to strike with conviction
either in the academic or popular worlds.
His Romans are statues of Romans,
lapped in togas of marble. His poets are
poetic dummies; not living men but
idealisations;
Virgil and Horace A curious contrast,
those two. Virgil was a tall and slender
young man, with a delicate and sensitive
face, and dark glowing eyes like those that
look out at us from the face of Saint John
in one of Raphael’s great religious pictures.
It was not merely because he had written
pastoral poetry that one could imagine
him as a shepherd on the hills, with a
crook in his hand, and a lamb in the
fold of his arm... .Horace, sitting opposite
to him, was of much smaller physique, per-
haps about the size of the little Scot who
wrote Dear Brutus; but he was at no dis-
advantage when they talked, and, curiously
enough, one ceased to observe,his physical
dimensions. Occasionally—we may be fairly
sure—he would rally Virgil a little about
his political idealism,..
Poets, generally speaking, do not walk
decoratively about with lambs in the
folds of their arms ; they eat them. Since
he is not able to bring the past richly,
intimately and physically to life, as Robert
Graves has done in his Roman novels,
Alfred Noyes would have done better
not to have attempted a biography, but to
have confined himself to a criticism of
Horace. It is as a critical work that his
book remains valuable, indeed distin-
guished. Its appeal is chiefly to the
academic world ; to which Alfred Noyes’s
name and reputation are doubtless suffi-
cient recommendation.
With Francis MacManus’s Boccaccio,
which arrived for review from Sheed and
Ward at the same time, Portrait of
Horace appears to inaugurate a series of
historical reconstructions. The latest is
The Death of Socrates by Romano
Guardini, which gives the text of four
Platonic dialogues with a commentary
and an essay on the very live subject of
death. In all three books a Catholic view-
point is unobtrusively presented.
Bodley and Soul.
From time to time in The Quest
(Hale) Mr, R. V. C. Bodley feels obliged
to mention the state of his soul; which,
one is happy to note, is pretty well. We
find him, for example, at dawn on a
beach in Java:
When I awoke it was not yet five, so I
went to the seashore. I took no chances
with the sharks and lay on the dazzling
sand with the waves breaking over my
legs. I felt again the peace which I had
begun to know in the Sahara. I tfelt de-
tached. I had the sensation which had
sometimes come to me on the desert that
I did not belong any more to the land of
the living. I looked at everything from a
long distance. I saw things in their true
perspective. I knew that most of the
things we thought mattered did not really
matter, that what convention called sin was
not sin. Right-doing and wrong-doing had
been decreed by men. Most of those acts
which were referred to as sin were created
by minds with ugly thoughts, by the
envious, and by hypocrites I edged my
body a little farther dov&r the beach until
the water lapped over my chest.
The objection to these lucubrations —
and they must be questioned—is not that
they are sinful, nor even that they in-
terrupt the narrative of Mr. Bodley’s
bodily travels, but that they are some-
what obvious. From the higher mystical
point of view it hardly seems worth
while for-Mr. Bodley’s soul to have been
transported from the Sahara to Java and
there immersed to the neck in sea-water
fnerely to make the discovery that the
things we think matter do not matter.
Even to newspapermen in city offices the
same illumination has been revealed.
In The Quest, as in his earlier books
describing his life among the Arabs—
“ The Arabs never kept up with the
Joneses” —Mr. Bodley sets out to find
“peace, or, more exactly, spiritual con-
tent” and, having found it, to bestow
that boon on his readers. An unfortunate
tendency towards sweeping generalisa-
tions —“A captain of a liner leads much
the same existence as the driver of a
Fifth Avenue bus and has much the same
mentality”—makes the fulfilment of that
noble object uncertain in the opening
chapters, at least as far as bus-drivers
and sea-captains are concerned.
The book, however, improves. Mr.
Bodley goes to some out-of-the-way
places in Java, Japan, Korea and China,
and he is an entertaining tale-teller. He
has a very curious experience in an
opium den in Hong Kong, he describes
with a lively pen the peculiarities of
Japanese behavior, and he is shipwrecked
on an island in the Pacific. His acquaint-
ances range from pirates to emperors.
In the concluding chapter, having
taken his soul to pieces “as I might the
engine of a car or the works of a clock,”
Mr. Bodley sails happily with the
machinery to America —“Grew had said
that I would like the Uqited States and
that the United States would like me.
I hoped so.” There, in the certainty that
his soul will burgeon into another book,
the reader leaves him ; if not exactly with
the profoundest of spiritual content, at
kast with tranquillity.
A World-Reformer.
Peace or Power (Faber) is “an analysis
of the condition of the Continent” by
Sir Harold Butler, who cut his teeth as
a bureaucrat and planner in the British
Labor Ministry during World War I, and
in the interval (between the wars was
either assistant-director or director of the
International Labor Organisation of the
now-defunct League of Nations.
Butler is no humorist or he would
hardly have chosen as a motto for his
dedication a sentence from General
Smuts which, without its context, is sheer
irony (and this book is anything but
ironical): “There is no malign fatalism
which makes fools of us in our dark
striving towards the good.”
Butler is one of those earnest souls
whose preaching on international ethics
is always to the English—that is to say,
to the converted: the oiitlook from
which it seems that either U.N.O. (a
mainly Anglo-Saxon ideal) must succeed
or civilisation will perish.
The plain truth is that no nation, per-
haps not even the British, is prepared to
give up sufficient of its sovereignty to
make the U.N.O. ideal work. Certainly
it is no use for Britain to do so alone.
We tiled disarming as an example, im-
posing sanctions as an example, in the
inter-wars period; and everybody else
laughed at us.
Over and above that, this book is too
full of “ifs” to be convincing, even to the
English. The non-English peoples show
no desire whatever to be made politically
perfect and eternally peaceful by British
argument. Between peace and power
those who see a chance of gain ahead of
them will prefer power every time. When
the Allies knocked out both Germany
and Japan—the regulators of Russian
aggression in the world before 1939—they
gave the Soviet an advantage (and even
an incitement towards expansion) which
it would be inhuman to expect Moscow
to resign. So far U.N.O. represents the
Anglo-American effort to persuade the
Soviet Government to turn a blind eye
to that chance—and a Soviet Govern-
ment looking for just such an opening.
A fair sample of Sir Harold Butler’s
conclusions;
National rivalries have prevented the
Continent from exploiting its potential
resources to the full.... Each country did
what seemed best to it without reference
to its neighbors, often prompted by the
belief that the maximum of self-sufficiency
was a proof of national virility or an asset
in time of war. As long as economic
thinking is guided by such preoccupations
Europe will remain a backward area.
And a fair sample of his preaching (his
thinking is riddled with this sort of
thing):
Its [U.N.O.’s] duty is not only to keep
the peace but to promote conditions of
economic and social security which will
raise the general level of well-being. In
many parts of the world it is still de-
plorably low, but if the technical and
scientific knowledge of the West is applied
to the task of raising the standards of back-
ward regions, there is no doubt the prospect
of economic progress is almost unlimited.
If peace is granted them, our grandchildren
may dwell in a world of prosperity which
we should hardly recognise.
All the world now has to do is to
agree with Sir Harold Butler and be
reformed.

On what ruling did N.S.W. Gover-
nor Sir Philip Game rely when he
dismissed the Lang Government in
1932 without reference to higher
authority ?
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, then Sec-
retary for the Colonies, laid it down
clearly in a communication to the
Governor-General of Canada in 1879
that the Governor of any British
colony “has an unquestionable con-
stitutional right to dismiss his Minis-
ters if from any cause he feels it
incumbent upon himself to do so.”
That doctrine was not challenged
while N.S.W. was a colony, and there
has been no alteration of the State’s
Constitution specifically removing the
implied power.

f (1) What were “pipes,” a form of
writing circulated freely in Sydney in
the early days? (2) Where could I
find full information regarding them
and see specimens ?
(1) The name given to scurrilous
papers lampooning high-placed
officials or other well-known persons.
The word is a slang-term and is the
noun of the verb “to pipe”; that is,
to watch a man and in some way
victimise him. The first pipes' were
circulated in 1803 against Governor
King, whose efforts to prevent the
sale of rum met with much hostility.

1915, at Courtney’s Post, Gallipoli,
he and four other privates were hold-
ing portion of a trench and were
attacked. Jacka’s four comrades were
killed or wounded, and single-handed
he disposed of seven Turks, shooting
five and bayoneting the others. (2)

A few details concerning the nan-
keen kestrel?
The Australian representative of
the kestrels, the nankeen kestrel, is
the commonest of all hawks through-
out Australia and Tasmania. It is
often called “sparrow-hawk,” but this
name gives an erroneous idea of its
habits, and belongs to a very different
species. Its food consists almost
entirely of mice, lizards and large
insects; while watching for them it
hangs poised and stationary in the
air, with rapidly-beating wings. In
power of hovering it is surpassed by
the tiny humming-birds of America
* * * *
Who wrote the words and music oj
“Rule Britannia” ?
The words are by James Thomson
(altered by Mallet); the music,
ascribed to Dr. Ame, is said by
Schoelcher (in his life of Handel) to
have been taken from an air in
Handel’s “Occasional Oratorio,” com-
posed in 1746, but the song and
music were really printed in Dr.
Arne’s masque “Alfred” in 1740.

How should carnation-plants affec-
ted by rust be treated ?
Dust lime over the plants while the
dew is on them or spray with a weak
solution of Condy’s fluid. The disease
unless treated is spread quickly from
plant to plant by aphides and insects.
Badly-affected plants should be burnt.
Do not use cuttings taken from plants
affected by the disease or give them
away to fellow-enthusiasts.
* * * *
Can the superb parrakeet be kepi
in an aviary ?
Yes, it is an attractive and delight-
ful cage-bird, easy to keep and breeds
readily in an open-flight aviary, well
known for its powers of mimicry.
Unfortunately, it is usually confined
in small parrot-cages. A hollow log
large enough to allow the birds suf-
ficient space to move about in, with
earth or decayed wood at the bottom
and hung in the open flight, is far
better than any imitation nesting-
place. The female alone incubates
the eggs. The mals feeds her while
sitting and helps her in feeding the
young. These may be left with their
parents for any length of time with-
out risk of injury. They can be fed
on a mixture of canary-seed, millet
and oats, with sunflower-seed added
when they are rearing young. Fruit,
especially apples, and green food
should be added to the diet.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
BRITAIN’S POLICY SHIFT.
Depending on developments
from it, Mr. Bevin’s speech in
the House of Commons on
January 22 may rank as the
most important he ever made.
For it set forth a historic shift
in British policy.
Instead of the traditional
policy of balance of power,
Britain, by the decision an-
nounced by Mr. Bevin, is now
embarked on leading the coun-
tries of the Continent into a
political and economic union—
he referred to it as “the Western
Union.”
Cables in most Australian
newspapers were largely con-
cerned with what others said
about the speech, giving little of
what Mr. Bevin himself said,
and that little mainly his forth-
right, if redundant, condemna-
tion of Soviet methods and
moves. One acute American
observer, noting that some mem-
bers of the Commons went out
for tea while Mr. Bevin was
speaking, commented that that
“was like walking out on his-
tory.”
The extracts from the speech
here given cover the historic
policy decision:
British policy in connection with
Europe, Mr. Bevin said, had been
based on three principles. The first
was that no one nation should
dominate Europe. The second was
that the old-fashioned conception of
the balance of power as an aid should
be discarded' if possible. The third
was that there should be substituted
four-Power co-operation and assist-
ance to all the States of Europe to
enable them to evolve freely, each in
its own way.
He was sure that the House and
the world would realise that if any
one Power pursued a policy of try-
ing to dominate Europe by whatever,
means, direct or indirect, it would
inevitably lead again to another world
war, and he hoped this idea would
be discarded by everyone. This the
British Government had striven, and
would continue to strive, to prevent.
The old-fashioried balance of power
he had no doubt led to intrigues and
to all kinds of difficulties, particularly
for the smaller States, which often
became the instruments of great
Powers. On behalf of the Govern-
ment he had stated that we would
not use, as an instrument of policy,
smaller Powers to produce difficulties
between the larger Powers. But
the Government could not agree to
four-Power co-operation while one of
those four Powers proceeded to im-
pose its political and economic system
on the smaller States. On the con-
trary, as public opinion in these States
changed, and as their economic and
social development progressed, none
of them would willingly submit to
the Great Powers interfering and pre-
venting the introduction of economic
changes or any other changes which
they deemed to be for their own
good.
Now we have to face a new situa-
tion. In this it is impossible to move
as quickly as we would wish. We
are dealing with free nations, free
to take their own decisions. It is
easy enough to draw up* a blueprint
for a united Western Europe and to
construct neat-looking plans on paper;
but that will have to be done a
step at a time. And surely all these
developments [the Russian peace-
obstructing tactics and extensions of
its “Police State” control] point to
the conclusion that the free nations
of Western Europe must now draw
closely together. I believe the time
is ripe for a consolidation of Western
Europe.
First in this context we think of
the people of France. Like all old
friends we have our differences from
time to time, but I doubt whether
ever before in our history there has
been so much underlying goodwill
and respect between the two peoples
as now. We have a firm basis of
co-operation in the Treaty of Dun-
kirk, we are partners in the European
Recovery Programme We are not
now proposing a formal political
union with France, as has sometimes
been suggested [most notably by Mr.
Churchill], but we shall maintain the
closest possible contact and work for
ever closer unity between these two
nations.
The time has come to find ways
and means of developing our relations
with the “Benelux” countries [Bel-
gium, Holland, Luxembourg], I
mean to begin talks with those coun-
tries in close accord with our French
allies 1 hope treaties will be signed
with our near neighbors, the “Bene-
lux” countries, making, with our treaty
with France, an important nucleus
in Western Europe.
We have then to go beyond the
circle of our immediate neighbors.
We shall have to consider the ques-
tion of associating other historic
members of European civilisation, in-
cluding the new Italy, in this great
conception. Their eventual participa-
tion is, of course, no less important
than that of countries with which, if
only for geographical reasons, we
must deal first. We are thinking now
of Western Europe as a unit. The
nations of Western Europe have
already shown at the Paris conference
dealing with the Marshall Plan their
capacity for working together quickly
and effectively. That is a good sign
for the future. We shall do all we
can to foster both the spirit and the
machinery of co-operation
If we are to preserve peace and our
own safety at the same time we can
only do so by the mobilisation of
such moral and material force as will
create confidence and energy in the
West and inspire respect elsewhere.
This means that Britain cannot stand
outside Europe and regard our prob-
lems as quite separate from those
of our European neighbors.
Referring to the organisation and
support of the Western Union —he
said he thought that was the right
description Mr. Bevin emphasised
that Europe had extended its in-
fluence throughout the world. In
Africa great responsibilities were
shared by Britain with France, Bel-
gium and Portugal, and in south-east
Asia we [British] were closely con-
cerned with the Dutch. The Western
organisation of Europe must be
economically supported, and that in-
volved the closest collaboration with
the Commonwealth and with the over-
sea territories of the French, Dutch,
Belgians and .Portuguese. Their raw
materials, food and other resources
could be of mutual advantage to
those territories and Europe and the
world. The other two great Powers,
the United States and Soviet Russia,
had tremendous resources and there
was no need of conflict with them
in this matter. If Western Europe
was to meet its balance of payments,
and in order to get world equilibrium',
it was essential that these resources
should be developed and made avail-
able, and exchanges carried out be-
tween them in a correct and proper
manner.
The [British] Government had been
considering planning for the terri-
tories for which we were responsible
so as to establish, out of our capital
production year by year particularly,
and also out of our production of
consumption goods, a proper propor-
tion, in the right order of priorities,
to assist this development. If they
got the plan they intended to develop
economic co-operation between the
Western European countries step by
step, and also to develop the resources
of the territories with which we were
associated, building up a system of
priorities which would produce the
quickest and most lasting results for
the world. It was hoped that other
countries with dependent territories
would do the same in association
with Britain. This effort would
stretch through Europe, the Middle
East and Africa to the Far East,
and it would not be exclusive but
intended to make the whole world
richer and safer.
In the Middle East Britain had
pursued a similar policy. The de-
velopment of the Arab countries in
the last 30 years had been remark-
able, and Britain had made a great
contribution towards it. The Gov-
ernment would continue efforts to
build up a system of co-operation
in economic and other fields which
would carry with it responsibilities
for mutual defence on both sides.
He had repeatedly said to the United
States and to the Soviet Union that
the Middle East was a vital factor
in world peace, and in addition it
was a lifeline for the British Com-
monwealth. That fact had never been
challenged, and he thought it was
accepted by all.
Mr. Bevin also said: His Majesty’s
Government have striven for the
closer consolidation and economic
development, and eventually for the
spiritual unity, of Western Europe as
a whole; but in Eastern Europe we
are presented with a fait accompli.
No one there is free to speak, or
think, or to enter into trade or other
arrangements of his own free will.
The sovereignty of the Eastern Euro-
pean nations is handicapped.
Neither we, nor the United States,
nor France, is going to approach
Western Europe on that basis. It is
not in keeping with the spirit of
Western civilisation. If we are to
have an organism in the West it must
be a spiritual union. While no doubt
there must be treaties, or at least
understandings, the union must
primarily be a fusion derived from
the basic freedoms and ethical prin-
ciples for which we all stand. It
must be on terms of equality. That
is the goal we are now trying to
reach. It cannot be written down in
a rigid thesis, or in a directive. It
is more of a brotherhood and less
of a rigid system.
Europe, in spite of criticism levelled
at her, has done an amazing job since
the end of the war. The countries
of Europe are returning now to estab-
lished law and order.
In this new settlement Germany,
like the other European nations, must
find her place, but she must not come
before her recent victims. As other
nations settle down Germany can
settle down too, but she must be
prevented from becoming aggressive
again. We shall welcome her return
as a democratic nation
In spite of all the artificial barriers
set up and the propaganda blared out,
we shall pursue a course which will
seek to reunite Europe. If the present
division of Europe continues it will
be by the act and the will of the
Soviet Government, but such a
division would be inconsistent with
the statements of the highest Soviet
authorities and of Stalin himself. He
[Stalin] told Mr. Stassen in Moscow
last April that for collaboration it is
not requisite that people should have
an identical system. We have always
tried, and we are still trying, to
co-operate with the peoples of Eastern
Europe on that basis, although the
activities of the Cominform, and
those of its predecessor the Comin-
tern, afford the greatest Hindrance
to mutual confidence and understand-
ing.
We shall not be diverted by threats,
or propaganda, or fifth-column
methods, from our aim of uniting
by trade, social, cultural and all other
contacts those nations of Europe and
of the world who are ready and able
to co-operate. The speed of our
recovery and the success of our
achievements will be the answer to all
attempts to divide the peoples of the
world into hostile camps.
Russian Wives.
Some weeks back (as noted
at the time in a “Political Points”
par.) A.B.C. broadcast a stagger-
ing and, if true, a shameful item
of news.
According to A.8.C., “Aus-
tralia” supported Russia, in dish-
ing a U.N.O. discussion on the
case of the Russian women
married to Britons and Ameri-
cans and refused their rights to
rejoin their husbands. “Aus-
tralia’s vote,” the A.B.C. broad-
cast reported, “helped to defeat
the British proposal.”
There has since been a dis-
cussion of the matter in a place
where “Australia’s vote” doesn’t
operate—the House of Lords’.
There (London “Times” re-
ported) :
Lord Vansittart called attention to
the continued detention of Soviet
wives of British subjects by the Rus-
sian Government. He said that the
fate of a few married couples might
seem a small affair to the new Moloch
or Molotov, but we did not see it in
that light. It was not merely a piece
of petty tyranny. It went far deeper.
It might be said that he imported
sentiment into politics. He pleaded
guilty to that. The universal pursuit
of happiness would likely be
successful if people ” sometimes fol-
lowed the heart, which God had given
to all, instead of the head, which he
had denied to some. He was sorry.
When he said “a heart to all” he
was wrong. There was no heart in
the Kremlin and no heart in those
who decided that those whom God
had joined must certainly be put
asunder in order to give pain.
His simple proposal was that Britain
should make a final appeal to Stalin
and ask him to fulfil his recent
promise to the Dean of Canterbury.
At the same time the British Gov-
ernment should intimate that if the
wives had not been returned to Britain
by the end of February Britain would
apply the principle of parity and
reciprocity and equalise the number
of Soviet women and children in
Britain with the number of British
women and children in Russia. The
Government should make an end to
the era of retreat. In a world half-
choked by cowardice, he asked them
to exercise an elementary, human right.
Lord Pakenham [for the Govern-
ment] said that he had seen one of
the afflicted husbands that morning
at the Foreign Office and heard from
his own lips his sad story. An issue
of this kind went to the root of
civilised behavior. It had deeply
exercised the Government for some
time past. Continuous and fruitless
representations had been made. It
was entirely incomprehensible why the
Russian Government had refused this
permission, and he was sure that the
people of Soviet Russia would be
equally puzzled if they knew all the
circumstances. The United States,
France and other countries were con-
fronted with the same problem as we
were and, like us, had been unable to
secure exit permits for the Soviet
wives of their nationals. The attempts
to solve the difficulty had been many
and various, and the Government
would continue to take every oppor-
tunity of expressing the indignation
and horror that all men felt at this
disregard of human values.
The “Australia” of the A.B.C.
report must feel proud of itself.
The Slashed R.N.
As announced by, Britain’s
Labor Government, the Royal
Navy—victim of the “recovery
programme” —has suffered a
sad change since Macaulay
described it as “that noble ser-
vice which, of all the instru-
ments employed by the English
government, is the most im-
potent for mischief and the most
powerful for good.”
The latest announcement
(January 21) was that the battle-
ships Queen Elizabeth, Valiant,
Nelson and Rodney and the
battlecruiser Renown would be
scrapped.
On the earlier announcement
that the Home Fleet, which
eight years ago was composed of
five battleships, two battle-
cruisers, two aircraft-carriers,
six cruisers, 28 destroyers and
20 other craft, wasi being re-
duced to one cruiser and four
destroyers, a London correspon-
dent of N. Y. “Times” com-
mented :
The Royal Navy, one of the foun-
dations of the British Empire, is
being reduced so drastically that many
an Englishman who has refused up
to now to accept the fact of Britain’s
waning power finds himself gloomily
admitting it.
“Navy,” the British Navy
League’s journal, commented
after the slashing of the battle-
ships that “the Navy is now un-
able to protect the national
home.”
The reductions mark a big
transition ; from sea to air. “Of
all the services, the R.A.F. is
probably the best off from the
point of view of money avail-
able and procurement priorities.”
The R.N. isn’t the only
sufferer. By the end of March
the total strength of Britain’s
armed forces will be down to
937,000 men, which will release
about 150,000 towards making
up the hard-felt man-power
shortage. This will involve the
removal of some divisions from
Germany and the Middle East;
reduction of the strength of each
infantry regiment of the line
from two battalions) to one;
cuts of up to 50 per cent, in the
strength of some garrisons in
overseas stations ; reduction of
operational ground forces in
R.A.F. stations abroad ; evacu-
ation of temporary Middle East
bases and smaller home estab-
lishments for bomber and
fighter groups.
Meanwhile, Britain’s defence
experts —of the breed that had
the Spitfires and much else ready
when vitally needed—are devot-
ing their time and a huge slice
of the defence vote to research
on such things as atomic bombs
and guided missiles. Moreover,
even with reductions, the R.A.F,
remains “the most formidable
air force in Europe”:
Experimental training with new
types of planes is continuous. The
Attacker, a new jet fighter, has been
perfected and is replacing the Spit-
fire. That most graceful and übiqui-
tous of fighters will be seen no more
in operational roles.
Also, comments the N. Y.
“Times” correspondent, there
are the “intelligence services,
traditionally able, circumspect
and shrewd”:
A joint intelligence bureau has been
set up to co-ordinate the findings of
the services, which exist wherever the
English are. And their footprints are
all over the globe.
Taking such things into ac-
count, “British power, although
its outward manifestations are
different from those to which
the world has been accustomed,
is far from finished.”
Liquidated Science.
In a “Nineteenth Century
and After” article on “Retreat
from Science in Soviet Russia,”
Dr. C. D. Darlington, F.R.S.,
speaks of “Stalin’s mistake” re-
garding Soviet scientists as being
“part of a plan which included
the dismissal of thei geneticists
and a great deal more besides.”
“The first victims,” states Dr.
Darlington, “were in 1932 when
G. A. Levitzky, the cytologist,
and his pupil N. P. Avdoulov
were sent to labor camps. Vavi-
lov asked Stalin for their release,
a request which was temporarily
and grudgingly granted. At the
same time B. S. Chetverikov, the
pioneer of population genetics,
and W. P. Efroimson were sent
to Siberia and nothing was heard
of them for 15 years. In 1935
the first two geneticists, I. J. Agol
and L. P. Ferry, were put to
death. In 1937 the head of the
great institute for medical genetic
research in Moscow, S. G. Levit,
was put to death and at the
same time probably Avdoulov.
In 1939 N. A. Iljin, an outstand-
ing animal-breeder, disappeared,
leaving a posthumous paper to
appear in the ‘Journal of Gen-
etics.’ In 1942, not only Vavi-
lov, but also his closest cyto-
logical colleague G. D. Kar-
, . , ~ , .
pechenko died (Tn the fighting,’
so it was said). At about this
time J. J. Kerkis, the Drosophila
geneticist, disappeared follow-
ing a party-cell intrigue, and
Levitzky was finally sent back
to a labor camp, where he, died,
At about this time also N. K.
Koltzov, the cytologist and
doyen of Russian biology, died
“S? WS Wid ° W COmmitted su ‘-
C ide.
“In a word,” Dr. Darlington
concludes “after 13 years of
Pf “cution, the great fellowship
Russian biological lesearch,
formed in the revolution, had
been crushed and broken.”
Dragnet Digest.
In Atom War. A nice grim
thought for anyone looking forward
to seeing a bit of atom warfare:
“Atomic war,” according to U.S.
expert Maj.-Gen. Leslie Groves, as
reported in Washington “Post,” “will
revolutionise the whole Christian con-
cept of caring for the injured. ,In
past wars, the worst injured were
given the first treatment. This must
be reversed after an atomic attack,
because the worse cases will be hope-
less while the others may be saved.”

Haircuts by Order—An American
correspondent, looking into what’s
wrong with the works in Germany,
reports this specimen in N. Y.
“Herald Tribune”: “An American
general, visiting a plant producing
goods for the occupation forces,
orders all the workers to have hair-
cuts. And this pompously silly order
is actually carried out.” Which at
least leaves a choice as to whom to
laugh at.

Nazi Loot. —Though U.S. authori-
ties in Germany a month or two
back fixed April 30 as the final date
for countries or individuals to put
in claims for restitution of non-
cultural loot, the search for looted
paintings and suchlike cultural items
may last for many years. The range
of returned loot in the first category
runs from 1096-carats’ worth of
diamonds returned to the Netherlands
to “an entire oil-cracking plant” re-
turned to Czechoslovakia. Also, 70
|ons of leather to Austria and 217
mink and silver-fox skins to Norway.
In the cultural class 500 to 600 paint-
ings and drawings and some 100
antique gold pieces from Pompeii and
Herculaneum, all looted from Italy,
are still among the missing. Returned
cultural loot includes many master-
pieces, among them Titian’s “A 1
Danae” (commonly called “Danae
in the Rain of Gold”), which was
Goring’s choice. So good as to be
almost incredible, Hitler’s choice for
Berchtesgaden was Breughel’s “Blind
Leading the Blind.”

Germany Produces. Contrary to
articles which have appeared in Aus-
tralian newspapers, suggesting that the
U.S .-British fusion of zones in Ger-
many has been a flop, a Frankfurt
correspondent of London “Times”
has reported that the value of exports
from the combined zones last year
exceeded $200m.: “Though far short
of the s3som. called.for under the
three-year plan of the Byrnes-Bevin
agreement consolidating ' the two
zones, this is still a remarkable
achievement when it is remembered
that little was achieved in the early
months of 1947, which were devoted
to setting up the joint machinery and
removing various restrictions against
trading with the enemy. Towards the
end of the year deliveries were being
made at a rate of more than s3om. a
month—that is, at a rate exceeding
the required $3 50m. for the year.”

New British Dye. “Wall-street
Journal’s” London correspondent re-
ports that Imperial Chemical Indus-
tries in Britain has developed a new
type of dye called “Aldan Blue,”
the “answer to the textile printers’
prayer.” Enabling the turning-out
of “British turquoise blue which will
stand up well under light and in
laundering,” it is the result of many
years of research.

Danger of Abuse. —In the House
of Commons debate on Mr. Beyin’s
announcement of the new British
foreign policy, Mr. Eden (London
“Times” report) said that “over and
above the actual happenings in vari-
ous countries we had witnessed the
campaign of calumny and abuse of
Western democracies carried out by
[Soviet] press and radio. British
Ministers and others had been the
victims. It might be true —he thought
it was —that it was no part of the
design of the authors of it that it
should lead to hostilities. But he
must be an optimist indeed who con-
sidered that it was possible to con-
tinue month after month, in a Europe
living as it was today, using that
language without imperilling the very
existence of peace itself. One could
not continue to wage a war of nerves
without eventually getting on some-
body’s nerves. There were two imme-
diate threats to peace, and they were
very seriousf One was the violence
of the language used by Communist
propaganda everywhere and the
violence of Communist action m
countries like Greece,. When Europe
was still littered with kindling it was
easily set alight. The other threat
was the risk that the countries of
Europe might fail to make a success
of their efforts to rebuild their coun-
tries with the aid of the Marshall
Plan, which was surely one of the
most generous acts in history.”

FACING THE MUSIC.
In the place where Mr. Sol Rosevear
sometimes presides as Mr. Speaker, and
sometimes descends to the floor of the
House to behave like the most rabid
party politician, there should be lively
times during the new session.
There will be “a full-dress debate” on
the international trade agreement, now
chiefly of theoretical interest, as Mr.
Chifley will have to confess when he
comes to expound his starvation cuts of
dollar imports ; a statement on defence
plans (hitherto confined to “Labor’s”
push-button ideas for making armed
forces unnecessary); and doubtless Our
Foreign 8 Policy will produce, through some
deputy for its Admirable Crichton (other-
wise engaged in the High Court), an
account of what it calls its success in
Palestine and Indonesia.
There will also be some’discussion on
whatever scheme for redistributing the
electorates may seem most favorable to
“Labor.”
Further business, initiated probably by
the Opposition rather than by the Gov-
ernment, should include demands for:
An amende honorable by the Leader of
the House to Mr. Blain, M.P., for the
disgraceful Mulcahy slanders against him
as a soldier and a Parliamentarian, and
expulsion from Parliament of his defamer
(thjs latter not in the least likely).
Failing voluntary action by the Minister
or Cabinet, a resolution that Mr. Ward
shall be suspended from office pending
judgment in the Garden trial.
A full statement and debate on the facts
in the Keane-Goldberg case, declared for
most of last year to be sub judice by the
Speaker.
An explanation from the Treasurer as to
why, when he must have known last year
of the threat to the Empire’s dollar-pool
resources, he permitted reckless expenditure
in dollars on Convairs, Constellations,
Ministers’ new Ministerial Buick cars (when
they already had sumptuous Chryslers), the
maintenance of unnecessary Ministerial
offices, notably in Latin America, and
caucus-members’ extravagant trips overseas.
An Essential Services Bill on the lines
of Victorian legislation, requiring a secret
ballot before any strike, and forbidding,
under heavy penalties against union execu-
tives or other strike-fomenters, the calling-
out of any union in defiance of a Court
order, or in occupations declared to be
essential community services.
A reduction of direct and indirect
taxation and a radical simplification of
income-tax assessment.
A revision of the wheat-acquisition
scheme to introduce such co-operative
management as will assure sales .overseas
and returns to growers at fair and equitatye
prices on ruling markets —not the gross
favoring of some buyers at the expense of
the Australian taxpayer (which includes the
wheatgrower).
These are only some of the heads. There
is to be expected an Opposition motion of
censure—modernly the only course by
which grievances can be seriously debated
—embracing many of these matters. By
that means or some other it is the duty
of Liberal- and Country-party leaders
to force Ministers into disciplinary action
against strikes*and loafing on the job
which are laying Australian industry
waste and killing the efficiency of Aus-
tralian workmen.
Though many “Labor” members may
not realise it, the clearing-up of the Blain
case will provide an eloquent demonstra-
tion before the public of their real atti-
tude towards the dignity and the status
of Parliament. The maligning of Mr.
Blain without evidence did much more
harm to themselves and to the body of
Parliament than to him personally. This
is at least a third instance of un-
scrupulous and false defamation of either
a soldier or a soldier’s relatives by some
“Labor” non-starter from a position of
Parliamentary privilege. The highest
form of national service seems to be as
obnoxious in “Labor’s” view as private
enterprise in commerce.
No less damaging to the Government
is the attempt, maintained through most
of last year, to cover up the unresolved
question (as The Bulletin has already
stated it): “Was Keane a Crook?” Mr.
Chifley ought surely to acknowledge suf-
ficient respect for the reputation of his
Ministry to see that the name of no
member of it continues under suspicion.
The circumstances in which Goldberg
used the late Senator Keane’s dollars
(“You wouldn’t know how many dollars
he had”), to fill with dutiable goods suit-
cases labelled as belonging to the
Minister’s widow, but brought into the
country by a Government typist, have
for long been crying out for ventilation
in Parliament. Whether Goldberg after
10 months still proposes to appeal against
the fine imposed is not the only aspect of
this case demanding some finality, and
Mr. Chifley must be blind indeed if he
cannot see it.
The Garden case is really sub
judice, but not so for Parliament the
question whether Mr. Ward, upon
whose Ministerial conduct serious reflec-
tions have been cast by Garden’s coun-
sel, should, pending the hearing, retain
his Cabinet office.
There are many overt signs of decrepi-
tude in the party which has long since
outlived public confidence. Neither here
nor in Britain will socialisation work ; it
is breaking down because it does not fit
in with human nature or our notions of
democracy. “Full employment,” mean-
ing the artificial creation of a condition
of more jobs than men, is a mockery of
prosperity—a mirage created by the
Chifley brains-trust through the simple
device of paying ever-growing Govern-
ment subsidies to keep down prices of all
essential commodities except labor. The
expedient started by being economic. It
has for some time been mainly political.
Anybody who does not go about in
blinkers can see that the Government’s
present action in withdrawing price-
subsidies is designed not to permit relief
in taxation, but to make a platform point
in the referendum campaign for per-
manent centralised control of all prices
and charges. The blackmarket crowd
have already in effect marked their ballot-
papers for “Yes.”
Those workers whom Mr, Chifley has
refused to “sacrifice” to the performance
of industrial agreements, duly registered
as Court awards, know this “Golden
Age” stuff won’t wash. They are “not
going to strain themselves in working for
Chifley” or anybody else so long as* easy
money lasts ; and, now that they perceive
that won’t last long either, they are just
spinning out the “good time” while they
can,
Mr. Chifley faces Parliament and the
rising gale with one poor hope left, his
Bank Grab Act. As the only “Labor”
member who evaded saying his set piece
in support of that legislation in Parlia-
ment, the Attorney-General is now—in
no good temper, judging by his opening
behavior in the High Court —instructed to
take the lead for the defendant Common-
wealth in the legal lists. Either at the
elections next year, or before, the intract-
able animal will, according to general
expectation, run into a stonewall and
break its neck ; and the sooner the better
for the country’s sake. Misgivings about
it are growing in the “Labor” ranks. Re-
cently the ingenuous young member for
Eden-Monaro told a meeting at Moss
Vale that “not one bank will be closed
until the people have their say at the next
elections.... It will be possible for any
succeeding Government to reinstate the
trading banks.”
What Mr. Fraser must be held to
convey is that Mr, Chifley is getting cold
feet. That, in the professional language
of the Minister for Short Supply and No
Shipping, was always a good bet. But
why, if Mr. Chifley does not mean to
proclaim the Act until [if] the electors
approve it, does he. refuse to hold a refer-
endum now, instead of spending the
money on a Court case which, apparently,
the Government is not defending for any
practical purpose?
This question also Parliament ought to
insist upon ejearing-up.
Cameron and Queensland.
"V
Characteristic of the New Journalism
and appropriate to the silly season was
the huge expanse of newspaper space
given to the affair of an A.B.C. man
who made a “correct-weight” announce-
ment after “the last” at Moonee Valley
when a protest had, in fact, been lodged,
thereby injuring the pockets and feelings
of bookmakers in all the States and
territories. Equally characteristic and ap-
propriate was a contemporary statement
issued by Postmaster-General Cameron,
in part as an answer to Mr. Fadden:
The Government [i.e., his “Government”]
should bring into production all land in
town or country which is being held idle
for speculative purposes all workshops,
mines and anything else needed for the
essential service of the people which are
not being fully used. All this is well within
the possibilities of practical politics under
existing conditions.
No, it is not “within the possibilities of
practical politics under existing condi-
tions.” It is excluded from “the possi-
bilities” for many reasons, the chief of
which is that Senator Cameron and his
colleagues are in office. Where intelli-
gence is called for their “Government”
is always found wanting. Where action
is required it exhibits all the torpidity and
temperature of a toad in a hole.
It is the “Government’s” own fault
that land is “held idle” and that mines
and workshops are “not being fully used.”
Traffic in land has: been stifled by its own
regulations and by the practice of its
land-sales office, except in cases like that
of the “good-as-‘Labor’ ” speculator
Parry. Underproduction in mines, work-
shops and factories is the direct result
of its failure to secure the conditions
under which full production could be
achieved —of its incentive-destroying
taxes, its habitual surrender to Commu-
nist strike-promoters and go-slow artists,
its incapacity not only to put down
union larrikinism but to give the nation
moral leadership. Only a member of this
guilty and incapable mob would have the
face to suggest that it could itself do what
it prevents competent men from doing.
Naturally, Senator Cameron could not
complete his counsel of perfection of the
Labor-socialist variety without blunder-
ing into damaging admissions. “If we
don’t do something on those lines,” he
said, “there is bound to be another de-
pression possibly even worse than that
of the ’thirties.” A self-condemnatory
prophecy considering that the prophet’s
“Government” has been on the Trea-
sury benches since October 7, 1941,
with five State “Labor” Administrations
keeping it company most of the time and
with supreme and unchallenged powers
all the time ; but, with the words “If you
go on keeping us in office” substituted for
“If we don’t do something on those
lines,” it may not be rudely dismissed.
Nor may acceptance be churlishly denied
to this Minister’s closing sentences:
No Government can justify itself unless
it sees that essential industries and services
are kept in commission. We should begin
doing it now.
Agreed, with the rider that “we” should
have begun “doing it” long ago ; but
what has been detaining Mr. Cameron’s
“Government,” especially in this year of
disgrace?
Mr. Cameron’s “Government” sat
supine, except for sneering at the
Ministry immediately concerned, when
a union with a Communist secre-
tary stopped the running of Melbourne’s
trams and feeder buses, in contempt of
the new “streamlined” Federal Arbitra-
tion system, and induced another union
to threaten the stopping of all Govern-
ment trains. The strike broken and the
threat overborne by resolute Liberal-
Country party action, the Communist
war on transport was shifted to Queens-
land by the Seamen’s Union. That Com-
munist-controlled organisation, to which
the Chifley-Cameron “Government’s”
customary attitude is one of total and
ignominious capitulation—it continues to
pay war-risk bonuses for the manning of
ships on the safest routes in the world —
virtually laid siege to the State which has
had “Labor” rule for nearly 31 of the
last 33 years and which, apart from its
own extensive commerce and trade, is a
great supplier of necessaries to southern
industries and consumers. This particular
Communist war was called off when
Government railwaymen, in the Com-
munist jargon, “took up the struggle,”
once more in contempt of industrial
arbitration, by depriving the Queensland
people of all their train services except
for the carriage of coal.
In both cases, as in the Victorian case,
Mr. Cameron’s “Government” did not
even try to “justify itself” by seeing that
“essential industries and services” were
“kept in commission.” On the contrary,
it basely abandoned the people to the
internal enemy.
Mr. Hanlon met the latest Communist
challenge with something of the spirit
shown by Mr. Hollway in Victoria,
though with different methods. For one
thing, he sought the aid of commercial
road transport for the provisioning of
Communist-besieged communities, and,
though commercial road transport has had
a raw deal from “Labor” Ministers, his
summons was loyally and courageously
obeyed. It would serve the Chifley-
Camerons right if the Old Digger Premier
invoked Section 119 of the Common-
wealth Constitution: “The Common-
wealth shall protect every State against
invasion, and, on the application of the
Executive Government of the State,
against domestic violence.” He could
fairly maintain that Queensland has been
invaded by Moscow agents from the
south and that forms of domestic violence
have been threatened and may be prac-
tised.
Developing the North.
“Ek Dum” on the potentialities of the
Northern Territory:
Since 1827, when a detachment was landed
at Port Essington, thousands of minds have
been concerned with the “problem of the
Northern Territory.” Mr. Cyril Chambers,
“Minister for the Army,” who knows a cow
from a horse and can tell grass from trees,
has, after a few butterfly flits into this area,
decided upon a solution. The 523,000 square
miles of the Territory holds about 10,500 white
inhabitants, one-third women, and a dwindling
number of aborigines.
Mr. Chambers’s solution, brilliantly simple,
is: Appoint a Minister for the Northern Terri-
tory.
At present the executive and administrative
set-up of the Territory is meagre, according
to “Labor” conceptions—a mere panjandrum
or so to about every 500 inhabitants. There
is, firstly, a Minister for the Interior. Deputies
of the Ministers of Defence, Army, Navy and
Air Force all have independent hands in the
management of the area. Customs and Foreign
Affairs Departments, as well as the Post Office
and the Railways, are kings in their own N.T.
spheres. The Taxation Department is a law
unto itself under Mr. Chifley. The Administra-
tor rules from a pretentious “residency” in
Darwin, and there is a Legislative Council,
just elected, which has no power whatever to
legislate and which certainly cannot come to
any independent decision, since it includes
a majority of civil servants and can be
overruled by the Administrator, who can in
turn be ordered about by the Interior Minister
or the Cabinet. Next there is a member for
the Northern Territory who has no vote save
on Territory Ordinances, and then only if they
are brought before Parliament, which mostly
they are not. Lastly, there are the two big
English pastoral companies, Vesteys and Bovril
Estates, and the North Australian Workers’
Union. There are hundreds of civil servants
of various brands.
The Territory is, in particular, like parts of
India which are almost barren of population
while 400,000,000 Indians swarm like ants along
the great rivers, in the temperate mountain
climates and in the luxurious south. A very
large proportion of it is four-inch rainfall
country. More than half of it is in the under-
-20-inch rainfall belt. Its rains are seasonal
and come at intervals of months and in sudden
and gusty deluges which in parts of it paralyse
normal life for weeks together.
That part of it which is most fertile, the
Barkly Tableland, and which impresses the
unknowledgeable visitor most, is poor in tim-
ber and almost devoid of herbage, so that it
is, generally, breeding rather than fattening
country, and certainly not sheep country in the
main. It is a fallacy to believe that no real
attempts have been made to develop it. In
the past 25 years it has been well watered
with sub-artesian bores, the quality of the
stock is high, a remarkable amount of fencing
has been done, modem luxuries, such as radio,
air-travel and refrigeration, have been brought
to almost every home' on it, and fine roads
have been built. Yet the population is smaller
than it was a few years ago. The Government
is hard put to it, even with the inducement
of complete freedom from income tax, to find
tenants for 500-mile, low-rental blocks, which as
often as not fall back into the hands of the
big companies.
These, on the Barkly Tableland, have certainly
done a great deal to improve the country, but
they have little encouragement, since the unions
make it difficult and expensive for them to
carry on. Cost of materials is prohibitive, and
the Government, while it gives the owners
freedom from taxes, does not extend the same
concession to employees.
In the west of the Territory, where the big
English meat companies rule, there is no de-
velopment at all. These stations have Gov-
ernment-kept stock-routes and roads to their
doors, where those facilities stop. One in-
dividual pioneer who has built up a rich oasis
and a home (26 miles beyond Victoria Downs)
of which any man could be proud, on a year-
to-year occupation of breeding country with
no fattening-land attached, is left to shift for
himself. Even if the holdings of the big com-
panies were divided they would not provide
settlement for a hundred families.
Generally speaking the Northern Territory is
a much less promising proposition than many
other parts of Northern Australia which are
of greater productive Capacity and more
strategic importance. Though in the beginning
its fine ports were nearer to Europe and closer
to established trade-routes than the south and
east coast, it has not established permanent
and continuing settlement even on the scale
of North Queensland and its central west.
Hundreds of thousands of young and adventur-
ous soldiers passed through the Territory over
a period of four years, but few showed any
disposition to return there except as civil ser-
vants, And certainly the appointment of an-
other expensive Minister and staff will not
impel a rush of population while labor is
under the command of a Communist-
run union that refuses to unload ships
unless the beer cargo is at the bottom of the
hold and which has by its arrogance and ex-
tortion reduced sea commerce to that of a
second-rate Portuguese Timor port.
The best that has been envisioned for the
Territory by knowledgeable men was embodied
in the Payne Commission’s report a decade ago
• —it promised that if "several millions were spent
on railway development it might be possible
to attain a population of 45,000 in a quarter
of a century.
On Queensland experience this is optimistic.
Central-western Queensland, beginning about
100 miles or less from the coast, despite the
fact that it contains some of the richest sheep
country in Australia, carried 23,000 people m
1945 on an area the size of. Victoria. The Far
Central West, which includes such prosperous
areas as Isisford and Winton, holds 5000-odd
on over 110,000 square miles, half of them
in the Winton district. North-western Queens-
land, from Hughenden outwards, is peopled
by 16,000-odd settlers on 150,000 square miles,
despite its rich mining areas. And in the
Peninsula of Cape York, mostly Thursday
Island, there are fewer than 2000 on 50,000
square miles. Three-quarters of Queensland s
population live on 50,000 square miles in the
Moreton and Darling Downs and Maryborough
districts. The 500,000 square miles outside
coastal city environs held only 84,000.
According to the last issue of the Queensland
official year book the mean population of every
inland district of Queensland except the south-
western has been at a standstill. The increases
in coastal areas are nearly all in the big towns
and cities. Under the strain of taxation, high
cost of materials, soaring wage costs, perenma
transport strikes and the paralysing of coastal
shipping by Communist wharf and shipping
unions, primary industry is everywhere in danger
and in some regions dying.
This is happening in country which has fuU
Parliamentary representation, both State ana
Federal, and plenty of Ministers. Like the
Territory, what it needs most is a new policy
which will give stability and restore low costs
and a plentiful supply of developmental
materials. Under present conditions there i
no chance of real development in pastoral areas
even if the whole Federal Cabinet takes a hand.
The best solution for these backward areas
is to give them local independence in govern-
ment so that they can fit their economies t
their regional needs and escape from the i tyran y
of the union bosses and of the dead hand or
Canberra.

The long day closes:
It was an Irishman who wrote, nobly, “I
do not know the method of drawing up an
indictment against a whole people”; and worthy
of remembrance always in this country is the
fact that two of the greatest and most patriotic
Australians of this century were sons of Polish
Jews.
The fathers settled in Victoria, one as a
tailor and the other, at first, as an importer
of fancy-goods. In the way of worldly posses-
sions they never had much, but out of their
decent and devout homes, made gracious by
maternal devotion, came Isaac Isaacs and John
Monash, both destined for honorable and dis-
tinguished careers, each unique, in the service
of the country and empire they loved. Now
Isaacs has gone to join the soldier who led
the Australian Corps to victory in 1918, and
of whom Lloyd George wrote that he had
all the qualities requisite for command of the
Imperial armies, though this the P.M. did not
learn till it was too late.
Melbourne was the birthplace and home-
town of both these eminent Australians of the
Jewish faith, and, after tribulations caused by
lack of pence, both graduated from its univer-
sity. Isaacs, the elder by 10 years (and 16
years the survivor), was an LL.M. of the 1880
vintage; Monash took his B.C.E. degree in
1891, and “finding that knowledge of law would
be invaluable in his work as an engineer,” he
qualified as LL.B. (he was Bachelor of Arts
also) in 1895. By that time Isaacs had not
only prospered at the Victorian Bar but had
become a rising politician: M.L.A. for Bogong
in 1892, James Patterson’s Solicitor-General in
1893, and George Turner’s Attorney-General
in 1894—a1l greatly to the taste of Monash,
who was a frequent visitor to the Assembly
debates. Isaacs was still Attorney-General in
1897 when chosen as one of the 10 Victorian
delegates to the historic Federal Convention
held at Adelaide and Sydney that year, and
at Melbourne January-March, 1898.
The order of election was: Turner, Quick,
Deakin, Peacock (Chief Secretary), Isaacs,
Trenwith, Berry, Fraser, Zeal and Higgins. All
Isaacs’s colleagues predeceased him (as was
recalled when Peacock’s widow died, as it
chanced, four days before Isaacs breathed his
last), and so did all the delegates from N. S.
Wales, South Australia, Westralia and Tas-
mania—Queensland was not represented. As
a member of the Constitutional Committee, and
as an effective debater and platform speaker,
Isaacs was a real architect of Federation, though
he was never fully satisfied with the instrument
of government finally adopted after ignoble
Sydney objections had been met.
From Bogong and the Attorney-Generalship
at Melbourne Isaacs went into Commonwealth
politics as M.H.R. for Indi (elected in 1901 and
re-elected unopposed in 1903), and much of
that early Federal legislation, which has had
enduring effects, bears the impress of his active
intelligence and shaping spirit of imagination.
Deakin, always an admirer, named him
Attorney-General and No. 2 in the Cabinet
in July, 1905, and appointed him a High Court
Justice in October, 1906. On the High Court
Bench he remained for 24 years, always respected
for his ability and character, but sometimes
giving the impression, especially to aspiring
lawyer-politicians whose ideas of constitutional
law did not correspond with his own —one he
silenced with a question, “Do you think we
came down in the last shower?” —that he was
more at home in the political field than in the
exercise of judicial power.
In 1930, when he was 75, Isaacs became
the recipient of honors without precedent or
possibility of repetition. On the retirement
of Adrian Knox he was raised to the Chief
Justiceship. In the course of a few months,
Baron Stonehaven being about to return to
England, he was appointed the first native-
born Governor-General. There were natural
objections, but not on the score of religion,
patriotism, inadequate services or failing powers.
Sworn-in on January 22, 1931, he saw his
five-years term through without treading on
corns or in any way departing from the dignity
of the office.
His powers failed only when he was on his
deathbed. In 1944, challenging the claims of
Zionist zealots to speak for Australians of the
Jewish faith, he wrote a series of articles for
the “Hebrew Standard,” astonishingly able
articles, in which he championed British policy
in Palestine and held that extreme Zionism in
the Holy Land, its inspiration drawn from the
Nazi philosophy, must inevitably descend to
Nazi methods of barbarism. In this matter,
as in others, and in extreme age, Isaac Isaacs
proved himself not only a good Australian but
a wise and farseeing citizen of the world.
That Queensland Railway.
During his tour of the south, Queensland
Premier Hanlon ran into Mr. Ward, the
Federal Minister for Transport—as well
as External Territories —in Sydney, Mr,
Ward happening to be in the big city
on some urgent business at the time.
According to Mr. Hanlon, Mr.. Ward is
still interested in the great rail-standardi-
sation plan, and, when the current Federal
Parliamentary session is over, will visit
Queensland “to go into the question
thoroughly.” That is, Mr. Ward says
he will.
Anyhow, what Mr, Ward wants is a
standard-gauge link from Bourke
(N.S.W.) to Cunnamulla, Charleville,
Blackall, Longreach and Winton. Mr.
Hanlon views this as a deep plot to
divert Western Queensland rail traffic to
Sydney, and holds that it wouldn’t “open
an extra acre, grow another sheep or
settle another person” in the area con-
cerned. What Mr. Hanlon —and most of
Queensland for that matter —wants is a
line through the channel country linked
with State ports like Townsville, Mackay,
Rockhampton and Gladstone. That, to
anyone concerned with decentralisation,
development of north and west Queens-
land, and the bringing into production of
vast agricultural areas and mineral de-
posits, is the only kind of railway—if rail-
way there must be —that would justify
the expense.
But to expect a Minister who depends
for his vote on a crowded Sydney suburb,
and who spends most of his official time
in the seclusion of Canberra, to see the
point is to hold some belief in miracles.
Mr. Hanlon is a bit too hard in the head
to be as credulous as all that. All the
same, he saved his State, from the blight
of the Joint Coal Board ; if he can save
it from the Ward-Clapp railway plan he
will not have lived in vain.
The Cosgrove Trial.
Still in progress at Hobart when this
issue went to press, and unprecedented
in all respects, was the trial of Robert
Cosgrove, Premier of Tasmania for eight
years, 1939-47, previously a Minister and
a party Whip, and member for Denison
since 1919.
Fourteen charges were detailed in the
indictment, which ran to 4000 words —
six of bribery as a member, six of cor-
ruption as Premier and two of con-
spiracy, James Thomas Sullivan, Charles
Guy, Herbert Sylvester Cook and Harold
George Fry, all in the road-transport
business, were named as the other parties
concerned and Sullivan was the principal
witness for the Crown.
Cosgrove pleaded not guilty on all
counts. A special plea of not guilty,
based on the pardons granted to the
alleged accomplices, as recommended by
Royal Commissioner Reed, was rejected
by Chief Justice Morris, after argument
with Cosgrove’s leading counsel, Sholl,
K.C., and his Honor ruled also that royal-
commission evidence was admissible.
Sullivan repeated his testimony as to
payments of £9OO in December, 1944 ?
July, 1945, December, 1945, June, 1946,
and June, 1947. To Mr. Sholl he said
the money was for party funds (this was
said also by Guy and Fry), and the
statement he signed for Opposition-leader
Campbell should have contained a refer-
ence to that fact —and would have had he
noticed the omission. He admitted hav-
ing had “a little trouble on the turf,” and,
under pressure, gave the name of a book-
maker, J. T. McGrath, of Launceston—
with whom he had made a £l5O wager.
“Why are you so hesitant?” the C.J.
asked. The reply was, “Well, there’s a
lot of bookmakers, and sometimes they
don’t put money in their books.”
New witnesses were C. E. Culley and
E, R. Howroyd, past and present Mini-
sters of Transport. Culley said the A.L.P.
had “enunciated a long-term policy for
nationalisation of road-transport ser-
vices,” but a Cosgrove denial that there
would be any “grab” of privately-owned
services had brought no criticism within
the party. That went also for the
Cabinet, Howroyd testified, adding that
Cosgrove had told colleagues he had been ;
offered £3OOO by Sullivan to “go easy.”
His own comment was “Why didn’t you ;
kick him out of the office?”
Evidence as to a Cosgrove account in
the E., S. and A. bank, held with former t
Treasurer Dwyer Gray till the latter’s
death, was given by Kathleen Dart,
Premier’s secretary since 1942. Into this
she paid banknotes handed to her by
Cosgrove, The Premier’s appointment-
book showed appointments with Sullivan
in December, 1944, June and December,
1945, June and December, 1946, and
March and May, 1947, but she did not
remember them, though she had seen
Sullivan in the office.
■♦ . -
Evatt v. Evatt.
In the action challenging the validity of
Chifley’s Bank Grab Act before the High
Court, Dr. Evatt as Attorney-General
is leading for the Commonwealth Govern-
ment ; and that is in the political category.
As Evatt, J., he sat on the case of N.S.W.
v, the Commonwealth in 1932, when Mr.
Lang challenged the right of the Lyons
Government to recover debts paid on be-
half of the defaulting State Government
by garnisheeing State revenue.
Evatt, J,, was one of a minority (of
two) which held that the defaulting State
Government —it was in default to the
Commonwealth Bank as well as the Com-
monwealth Government —could not be so
forced. He said, in part:
In respect of this taking of State revenues
in advance of the High Court’s decision,
the Commonwealth combines the roles
of plaintiff, Judge and executioner. In the
meantime the exercise of [the State’s]
legislative and executive capacities may be
completely paralysed The [Lyons] Act
is a law for the enforcement of the Finan-
cial Agreement as against the States of the
Commonwealth and against them a10ne....
On this part of the case the States
succeed because the Financial Agree-
ment Enforcement Act subjects them to an
“unequal and discriminating” jurisdiction.
Although the States are not (completely)
sovereign bodies, neither is the Common-
wealth.
But now the boot is on the other foot,
and Evatt, J., having in the interim
stepped down from the Bench and re-
entered politics, becomes advocate for a
Government which, balked last year by
the High Court in an effort to compel
local-government bodies in the States to
bank with the Commonwealth Bank and
none other, promptly brought down and
passed a bill to abolish the trading banks
altogether. The Commonwealth under
his legal advice sought to make itself
“plaintiff, Judge, and executioner” in its
socialisation cause, and paid as little heed
to State rights under the Financial
Agreement—to arrange for overdrafts,
for instance, from their regular bankers
—as to the interests of the mass of citi-
zens in their banking habits.
That the Bank Grab Act may “com-
pletely paralyse” the States no longer
seems to matter in the least.

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
Hanlon has only to stand firm and
he will beat the Communists, whose plan
for Queensland, dished in France, Italy
and Victoria, is anarchy and misery.
And in the second week of the railway
stoppage, after a fortnight of the running-
shed strike, he was hanging on as befits
an Old Digger. But, as always, he hadn’t
received a scintilla of support from
Chifley. Chifley—“Chif.” to his press-
boy flatterers —“won’t crucify the
workers” —which, freely translated, means
that Communists have got him where
they want him—scared stiff.
Two contemporary items of news about
Communists, the first from Washington:
The Department of Justice announces
the arrest of John Williamson, national
labor secretary of the U.S. Communist
party, who will be held for deportation to
his native Scotland.
The other was from Brisbane:
Key job of controlling the railway strike
has been taken over by A. Macdonald, a
leading Queensland Communist, secretary
of the Queensland Ironworkers. He be-
comes full-time secretary of the Disputes
Committee, 22 in number, of whom 11
are Communists or fellow-travellers.
What a paradise for Communists this-
country has become! Deported from
America if alien-born, and outlawed
from union office, they can and do set
Australian law at defiance and wage
wicked forms of war on a whole people
with utter impunity.
The Hollway Government is committed
to two big healing projects, each esti-
mated to cost half a million —a t.b. sana-
torium at Watsonia, 10 miles from Mel-
bourne, and a cancer-treatment and -re-
search centre, probably on the site of
the old Queen Victoria Hospital. In
this it is to have co-operation—the Gov-
ernment at Hobart will establish associa-
ted clinics.
The last has not been heard of the
Malays ordered for deportation by Cal-
well, who bungled the whole business, nor
have some of them been seen. Their sym-
pathisers at Singapore, banded together
in the Malay Union, are appealing to the
Human Rights Commission. Why, this
is one of Dr. Evatt’s special U.N.O.
babies, the other being the Palestine Com-
mission which is—somehow —to secure
this “settlement.”
According to one of those “columnists,”
Chifley has four friends to whom he lends
books from his “whodunit” library, and
he proposes to add to the number. Why
not make it six? Droves of people could
suggest the fifth and the sixth.
Ashley found himself in a spot of
bother last week. Called upon to
annul the Gallagher penalty-suspension
inflicted on F.E.D.F.A. men for an illegal
strike, he had to temporise. Whereupon
his bosses withdrew, muttering darkly
about a “general coal strike.”
At a very long convention at Coolan-
gatta (Q.) the A.W.U. urged Calwell to
accelerate the business of bringing in
“migrants” by air. It said the sugar in-
dustry alone was short of 2500 laborers,
adding that it didn’t care where they
came from, provided they are “white and
decent.” Calwell straightway promised the
introduction of 500 Northern Italians.
An ignoble concession to prejudice.
Farm-workers come from southern Italy.
Northern Italians are factory and work-
shop hands.
Canberra has been the scene of more
wheatr conferences: Pollard and the use-
less Australian Agricultural Council;
Pollard and the Wheatgrowers’ Federa-
tion. They were designed to bring forth
an “immediate wheat-stabilisation plan,”
but it was no go. The growers have had
“stabilisation.” What they yearn for is
the feeling that the wheat they grow is
their own property.
The case of the season:
Scene, the High Court. Melbourne, on a
sweltering day, the thermometer at 104. On
the Bench sit six Justices in a precisely-spaced
row, and below them 10 rows of counsel. All
are wigged, and each has before him a type-
written volume as big as War and Peace.
A K.C. is reading from his copy. A Justice who
has temporarily, and very naturally, removed
his wig looks up and asks a question, which
is answered by Dr. Evatt; then the reading
proceeds. Of the general public there are about
20 present. There was a lunch-hour whisper
of a preliminary incident which, if open to
press and people, would have drawn what
showmen call a “capacity” crowd; but audi-
ence there was none.
One with Nineveh and Tyre is the Mc-
Girr fantasy about compelling retail-
deliveries to homes. It has been scrapped
in favor of night trotting with gambling.
Night trotting was the one contribution
of Victorian “Labor” to the imagined
necessities of the times before the axe
fell.
The N.S.W. Agricultural Department’s
“Review of Marketing and Agricultural
Economics” asks, “How long is the cur-
rent rice shortage likely to last?” and
answers the conundrum itself:
Efforts were made to expand the rice
industry in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area and on the Berriquin and Wakool
Irrigation Area So as to avoid the build-
ing up of private vested interests the area
sown at Wakool was handled by the
Water Conservation and Irrigation Com-
mission and not by individual growers.
Rice production was discontinued in that
district in 1946.
So the shortage of rice is due not to
farmers objecting to growing the stuff, but
to a socialist Government preventing them
from growing it.
Brisbane “Grammar” can claim Air
Vice-Marshal Donald Clifford Tyndall
Bennett as one of the many grand Aus-
tralians whose names are on its roll.
Bennett went into the R.A.A.F., thence
into the R.A.F., and as A.O.C. Path-
finders, Bomber Command, he made an
international reputation during the
1939-45 war. Becoming Chief Executive
South American Airways, he managed to
make the enterprise pay when all the
other “nationalised” airways showed im-
mense losses; so, naturally, he was
sacked. Sacked with the sanction of
Lord Nathan, the “Labor” Minister for
Civil Aviation, who came under criticism
in these parts for prodigal use of petrol
rivalling that of racing-mad Com-
monwealth “Labor” politicians; and
though the charge was published there
has been no published answer.
Air Vice-Marshal Bennett was Liberal
M.P. for Middlesborough West in 1945,
losing his seat at the general elec-
tion. He has now come out for the
North Croydon by-election. Good luck
to the gallant Queenslander!
There is a familiar touch in a “Fort-
nightly” article on Eire politick and the
Eire politician: “He becomes not only
the people’s chosen representative but
also their appointed agent for wheedling
facilities from Government departments.”
So it is with our “Labor” politicians of
Irish descent, who are agents when they
are not voting-machines. This would
have horrified Burke, the greatest states-
man of their race, and the greatest of all
British political thinkers. Burke laid it
down also that “the concessions of the
weak are the concessions of fear,” and
that “when bad men combine the good
must associate, else they will fall one by
one; an unpitied sacrifice in a contemp-
tible struggle.” But, “Labor” politicians
of Irish extraction never read Burke.
They prefer racebooks.
“Liberal Opinion” has come out with
a photograph of “the mansion in which
Digger Blain’s slanderer lives —it is in
Hillside-crescent, one of the most charm-
ing parts of exclusive Vaucluse”:
While Mulcahy was amassing, principally
out of selling beer, the wherewithal to
choose this place, the man he slandered,
Digger Blain, M.P., was fighting for him
in both world wars, finally suffering years
of agony in Changi Camp with his mates
of the Eighth Division.
No mention of the Mulcahy booze in-
terests, though by all accounts a Mul-
cahy pub has been the centre of a beer
strike.
Tito is reported as saying “There will
be no war because people don’t want
war.” How different from 1939, when
not only were Britons spoiling for war,
but every man, woman and child in
France and Poland was begging the Gov-
ernments of tljose countries to lead them
into a scrap. And from 1940, when the
Belgiafts, Dutch, Danes and Norwegians
were poised in arms', waiting for the
slightest excuse to spring to their own
defence. And from 1941, when not only
the Greeks but also the Yugoslavs showed
similar warlike intentions, Tito himself
only when the Russians forced their
leaders to wage war on the invading
Germans.
The Communist O’Shea, secretary of
Melbourne’s trammies’ union, which held
up the trams for a fortnight, is on the way
out. However, it is not a case for tears.
O’Shea can drive a tram, and the board is
still short of running staff.
As if 19 Ministers at Canberra and 62
in the States were not enough, Chambers,
the Minister of Forceps, has suggested a
Minister for the Northern Territory. He
has been visiting the Territory and is
“convinced that something should be done
for its development.” The argument
might carry more weight if it came from
someone else. After all, the Army has a
Minister, and Army “development” is
such that “about 5000” regulars have
been enlisted, though 19,000 were asked
for, and “it is doubtful whether suffi-
cient uniforms will be available five
months hence when recruiting for 50,000
militia is due to begin.”
The lag in recruiting for “Labor’s”
army has evidently been remarked in the
Mediterranean and the Middle East.
Anyway, three Maltese, two Greeks and
one Yugoslav have offered to enlist —
by letter from Cairo.
The “W.A. Service Station and Motor
Trader” has a petrol-sales plan guaran-
teed to “shorten the time between hand-
ing over of the envelope and the check-
ing of same” and “reduce to a minimum
the number of hands through which it
will pass”;
As in the past, resellers will place tickets
to the value of a delivery in an envelope
which will be handed to the tank-wagon
driver. When the envelopes reach the par-
ticular ofl company’s depot, they will be
subjected to a check jointly by an official
of the Fuel Board and an officer of the
oil company.
After which, presumably, Ashley will an-
nounce that petrol-rationing is unlikely to
be discontinued.
One of those things which nobody ex-
pected to happen has happened. A war-
widow has been “allotted” a home by the
N.S.W. Housing Commission. Any day
now we may hear of a N.S.W. Digger
who has been allotted a block of land
on which to begin farming.
The great petrol mystery becomes
deeper and darker. When Chifley
warned all hands that there mightn’t be
enough to go round in March, oil com-
panies in three States arose to say they
had plenty of the stuff, and one even
forecast the end of rationing. “Not this
year or next,” howled Ashley, “the
Minister,” thinking of his fuel boards
and their herds of employees. Next a
fuel “authority” was heard threatening to
do all sorts of things to the Sydney
service-stations accused of selling petrol
at cut rates to taximen —yes, at cut rates !
“Lao-dah” has his doubts:
Where formerly the young Malay or Indo-
nesian scraped enough together to get himself
packed in a pilgrim ship and transported to
Mecca, to return —if he survived —as a haji,
now, thanks to Dr. Evatt, he will be eligible
for a scholarship at some Australian seat of
learning. Cost to the taxpayer is reckoned
at “about” £5OOO p.a., which will mean £50,000
or so p.a. It would be cheap at the price
if the object—the promotion of friendly re-
lations —were achieved; but will it be?
Gandhi broke his caste law to go to London
for a university education, and a sharper thorn
for Britain’s side couldn’t have been manu-
factured. Pandit Nehru and most of the other
Indian leaders had the benefits of foreign edu-
cation, and so had many of the figures in the
Indonesian, Philippines and Chinese and Indo-
Chinese revolutionary movements. Indeed, at
the back of every Asia-for-the-Asiatic agitation
will generally be found a turbaned or fezzed
M.A. or B.A. Why, in Australia’s case, it
will be any different is a question to which
Dr. Evatt may have the answer. But unless
they are all fools the Asiatic students will
observe on landing in this country a slight
discrepancy between precept and example, not
only in Dr. Evatt’s case but in that of Calwell,
of “two Wongs don’t make a white” notoriety.
It will be no good Labor turning
Mulcahy, M.P., loose on J. L. Garrick,
whom the N.S.W. Liberal party has
appointed its general secretary at 29.
Though he has spent almost half his adult
life in Jap prison camps, he held no gold
pass which he could be accused of show-
ing to his; captors “to gain special treat-
ment.” The only emblem with which he
was equipped to influence them was a
Japanese Army shovel —and his exhibi-
tions of that on the Burma-Siam railway
didn’t do him much good.
There was a touching exactness about
the Chinese Census Bureau’s announce-
ment that the population of the Flowery
Republic is now 461,006,285. In the days
of Marco Polo the method was that
of counting “fires” and multiplying the
figure by the known fertility of the
Chinese mother. Nothing staggered
Marco more in Kublai Khan’s empire
than the enormous size of the population,
unlike that of any European country he
had known; the Venetian saw a vast
number of walled cities pullulating with
human beings, and rows of small shops
which lined both sides of the highways.
Famine, pestilence, floods, civil war and
infant-mortality make no difference to
the Chinese mother. She continues to fill
her quiver, if not the stomachs of her
family.
Another of those “controllers” has
been heard from. One £L M. Dash,
“Commonwealth Potato Controller,”
“criticised shipping companies for their
failure to provide ships to bring potatoes
from Tasmania.” Hasn’t the man heard
of the Seamen’s Union, whose latest
pleasantry was to tie up Queensland
shipping, of wharfies who quit when the
beer gives out, of docked ships idle
for months because of strikes? Has he
never heard of potato, ships collecting
barnacles in Sydney until potatoes, rot
and the wharfies then demanding “stench
money” to unload them?
Convairs, which T.-A.A. hurriedly
ordered for its inter-State services, have
come under fire from “an official of
an overseas air corporation” who alleged
that the Convair was never intended
to fly routes such as that between
Adelaide and Perth, its normal limit-
range being 800 miles, and its natural
haulage distance 300 miles with full
load. Coles (“Nothing over half a
crown”) protested that the Convair has “a
range of up to 1100 miles and can do
1450 miles with a light load.” Be this as
it may, no private concern would have
thought Convairs a good bet for such a
service at nearly £lOO,OOO each in dol-
lars, with a “Labor” dollar veto to be
reckoned with.
Sydney “D.T.” has rebuked wheat-
growers for rejecting the “Labor -
socialist “stabilisation” scheme. It fails
to realise that the growers don’t get their
money when they earn it, have no equity
in future dividends from “stabilisation
funds” if they should sell out or die, and
have lost all confidence in the mob
that sold 16s. wheat to N.Z. “Labor” for
ss. 9d. Let the “D.T.” imagine itself
“controlled” as to customers, sales, prices
and payments as are the wheatgrowers.
How it would perform if the Govern-
ment took all its revenue, gave it about
a third to go on with, fobbed it off with
another “advance” or two later on, and
held the remainder against a problema-
tical time when “realisations” fell below
a fixed “guarantee price,” meantime let-
ting a pal have advertising space at about
a third of the regular cost!

PERSONAL ITEMS
Toowoomba-born Donald Bennett in
the course of his rise to the rank of
Air Vice-Marshal —at 34 the youngest to
reach that status —collected a long string
of honors, but when he was dismissed
from the job of Chief Executive of
British South American Airways last
week he announced that he had just re-
ceived the greatest honor of his life —
“I have been sacked for having spoken
my own mind.” He followed that up by
revealing his intention of contesting the
Croydon by-election as a Liberal, in order
to fight to the utmost against “Socialist
strangulation.” Just before the war
Bennett made a record crossing of the
Atlantic in the pick-a-back plane Mercury,
and in 1940 he established a world’s
record for a long-distance seaplane flight.
He also made the first non-stop flight
from Britain to South Africa and from
Britain to Canada. Still a young man,
there is no saying what Bennett may yet
achieve, but his real niche in Britain’s
Hall of Fame will always be as the leader
of the Pathfinder Force which spear-
headed the Bomber Command’s attacks
on German industry.
New leader of the Queensland Peoples’
party in succession to Bruce Pie, retired
through pressure of business, Thomas
Alfred Hiley entered Parliament in 1944
as member for Logan and came back
last year with a greatly increased majority.
Educated at Brisbane Grammar, he
entered the Public Service in 1921, but
gave it up after three years to become
a public accountant. He is Queensland
partner of a large accountancy firm, and
a member of the Commerce faculty at
the University of Queensland. A six-
footer and athletically built, Hiley is one
of the best speakers in the House. He’s
42.
No stranger to these shores is the Ven,
Kenneth Julian Bickersteth, Archdeacon
nf Canterbury. Educated at Rugby and
Oxford, he was ordained in England in
1909 and came to Australia in 1915 as
chaplain and assistant-master of Mel-
bourne Grammar. As a chaplain in
World War I he was twice mentioned in
dispatches and was awarded the Military
Cross. On demobilisation he went to St.
Peter’s College, Adelaide, as headmaster,
remaining until 1933, when he returned
to England as head of Felsted School,
Essex, from which position he became
archdeacon of Canterbury. He will
arrive in Australia this month to make
an appeal for funds for the restoration of
Canterbury Cathedral. More than
10,000 explosive and fire bombs fell on
Canterbury, several within the precincts
of the cathedral. The main edifice
escaped, but much of the historic and
beautiful surroundings suffered.
Canberra is smacking its lips over a
story concerning J. S. Weatherston, for
years its principal Parliamentary reporter,
and still a resident. Weatherston, an able
newspaperman in Westralia before he
joined the “Hansard” staff —as was his
eventual successor, George Romans, now
m.c. Parliamentary broadcasts for
A.B.C.—devoted five years of his retire-
ment to the preparation of a book,
Burke’s Dash to Carpentaria. In the
process he made many interesting dis-
coveries, one being that the luckless ex-
plorer was an uncle of the lady who be-
came Mrs. Neville Chamberlain; and,
chiefly to have the work published in
this period of newsprint scarcity, he
applied for a Commonwealth Literary
Fund grant. It was refused on the ground
that his work is historical and history
isn’t literature.
Rhodes Hambridge, M.A., M.R.C.S.,
L.R.C.P., just arrived in Sydney to take
over the Red Cross t.b. clinic, is making
his third visit to these parts since his
original departure 15 years ago—in 1938
he was here as a member of the English
crew which won the Empire Games
“eights” on the Nepean, and during the
war he came back again with the R.N.
Son of Frank Hambridge, mining man
and old Bulletin contributor, Rhodes
was born in Sydney in 1913, began his
education at the Kings and Sydney Uni.
and continued it at St. John’s College,
Cambridge, and St. George’s Hospital,
London. Since then he has been
house - physician and assistant resident
medical officer at Brompton Chest Hos-
pital ; resident medical officer at the
British Legion Sanatorium, Nayland, Col-
chester ; surgeon-lieutenant, R.N.V.R.,
when he was M.0.-in-charge of chest
wards at the R.N. hospital in Sydney
and acting-C.O. of the t.b. division of
106 A.G.H. at Bonegilla (Vic.) and, since
the war, chest physician for the Surrey
County Council —experience which led to
his present appointment over a wide range
of applicants. The t.b. wog occupies
most of his time ; otherwise his main in-
terests are his family, scientific journals,
swimming and listening to radio plays.
“Join the A.N.A. and live to a ripe
old age”! Isaac Isaacs was 92. George
Henry Wise (M.H.R. for Gippsland
1906-13, 1914-22, Hon. Minister 1918-20,
P.M.G. 1920-22) is rising 95. Wise’s
career as a Federalist antedated that of
Isaacs. In January, 1890, he was a vice-
president of the “intercolonial” A.N.A.
Federation conference at Melbourne;
one of his fellow-delegates was S, H.
Prior, afterwards of The Bulletin for
30 years, and then only 21. In the follow-
ing year Wise was the association’s chief
president, and he has been a director since
1887.
“C. 8.”: The State funeral accorded
Tom Tunnecliffe in Melbourne had a
unique feature not mentioned by any of
the dailies, and round which echoed
memories of hot controversies of the
’eighties. An old socialist, Tunnecliffe
requested that his funeral should be con-
ducted under the auspices of the Ration-
alist Association. The ceremony was
performed by W. Glanville Cook, secre-
tary of the association, at the Springvale
Crematorium. The director remarked
afterwards that it was one of the most
impressive he had ever witnessed.
The address, Vic Hall, Northern Terri-
tory, would have been sufficient to find
the subject of this Prior sketch any time
these last 20-odd years—and, for that
matter, stiff is. Hall is an Englishman
who joined the B.E.F. at 17 for World
War I, put in four years in France and
came through with the M.M. and bar,
several wounds and' a feeling of wander-
lust that led him presently to Westralia.
There he roughed it for two years in
pearling luggers out of Broome and a
similar period on a Nor’-west cattle-
station and took part in an expedition to
the Kimberleys, before getting into
the Northern Territory Mounted Police.
As a mountie he covered the Territory
NORTHERN TERRITORY MOUNTIE
from one end to the other, serving in turn
in almost every district. Half a lifetime
in the North has left him with an abiding
love for the country and a deep regard
for the blacktracker, without whom he
considers the job of keeping the Law in
the Territory would be well-nigh im-
possible. Having learned the story of
the North, Hall has set himself the task
of telling it to the world. He has already
published one novel, Bad Medicine;
another is on the way and he has planned
a history of the Mounted Police.
“Cauboy”: Although Ignaz Friedman
had been giving concert performances
for half a century, ever since he was an
infant prodigy in Poland, and had played
before half a million people, what
he liked best when visiting Mqjbourne
was to slip off and seek out his old friend
Edward Goff, the Czech pianist and
teacher, who, like himself, had been an
infant prodigy, had played all over
Europe, U.K. and America while still in
his teens and, like him, had
won the Beethoven Prize,
the most coveted musical
award in Europe. In their
young days the two had
toured together. Seated be-
fore two pianos in Goff's
small study at Mont Albert,
amidst its Beethoven masks
and original scripts of the
master’s music, they would
play one concerto after
another, their entire audi-
ence on one occasion being
myself. Friedman was just
as absorbed as he had been
the previous evening when
he played before an audi-
ence of 3000.
Current shortages in Melbourne include
an acute dearth of Judges, and it has
even been suggested that the existing
Solons do night shift and work on a
roster. The legal profession, however,
views this revolutionary proposal with
great disfavor. The lack will be partly
made up by the appointment of J. F.
Mulvany, K.C., to the County Court and
chairmanship of General Sessions. A
Christian Brothers boy, he is 43 and gives
up a practice worth at least three times
the salary of the Judgeship. A hard-
hitting advocate, he has specialised in
criminal and equity jurisdiction. His
father was a one-time secretary of the
Department of Commerce.
Lieutenant-Commander John Edward
Ironmonger, R.N., who recently joined
the staff of Naval Aviation at Navy
Office, Melbourne, as technical officer for
air and ground radio, knows many Aus-
tralians, yet this is his first visit here. A
keen amateur radio enthusiast, he
“worked” many Australians engaged in
the fascinating hobby through his own
station, GBPO, London. In the four
months before he left England he carried
out experiments with an unusual beam
aerial which brought him 368 telephone
contacts with Australia in 96 days. Now
he is in Melbourne he has been able to
meet the many friends whom he spoke to
“over the air.” Among these was H.
Kingsley Love, pioneer member of the
Wireless Institute of Australia, and one
of the first Australian radio amateurs to
be heard in other lands —more'than a
quarter of a century ago.
The Rennie Memorial Medal, awarded
by the Australian Chemical Institute for
the best contribution to the development
of chemical science in Australia by a
member under 30, goes this year to J, H.
Mills, research fellow and tutor in
chemistry at Adelaide Uni., who continued
the research begun by Professor A. Killen
Mcßeth into the constituents of
eucalyptus oils from trees found on
Kangaroo Island (S.A.). Mills won a
qualifying bursary to Kadina High
School and the Thomas Price Scholarship
to Adelaide Uni., where he collected his
B.Sc. in 1938 and his Master of Science
degree in 1944. He’s 28.
Another Australian to get a big over-
sea job, Charles M. Cock, appointed
electrical engineer to the nationalised
British railways, began his career as
an apprentice fitter and turner at the
Newport Railway Workshops. He helped
in the electrification of the Melbourne
suburban system and the construction
Of the Newport power-station for the
Electricity Commission, was in India
for 14 years installing electric-trains and
power-stations, and when that country
was threatened by a Japanese invasion
organised the Bombay motor-boat patrol,
and later served with the R.I.N.V.R. as a
lieutenant-commander —he had served
with the R.A.N. in the earlier war. He
was chief electrical engineer of the
Southern Railway, England, up to when
the Attlees took it over.
“F.S.” on a fine old Australian:
Isaac Isaacs, Australia’s first native-born
Governor-General, never seemed to know what
fatigue was. Up to the day of'his death in
Melbourne, at 92, he was always ready
to make a statement on any public matter if
asked for it, and always insisted on preparing
it himself on a typewriter which had had
ISAAC ISAACS, as Low saw him.
generations of service. Born in the back room
of an Elizabeth-street shop kept by his father,
a tailor, young Isaac, at five, was transported to
Yackandandah, where the goldminers needed
clothes, but where there Were none of the
facilities for acquiring the culture for which he
displayed an appetite that persisted all his life-
time. So Alfred Isaacs moved to Beechworth,
where there Was a grammar school, at which his
son prospered so quickly that he was a pupil
teacher before he was 13. At 15 he was a full-
blown teacher at £2 10s. a week, teaching in
State school in the daytime and running night
classes of his own. At the University law school
later he rose at four in the morning and went
to bed at midnight. By 25 he had refused the
management of a legal business at £7OO a year
and had his own practice in the old Temple
Court building. Called to the bar, he Was earn-
ing £BOOO p.a. in fees eight years later, and by
1899 was a Q.C. and M.L.A. for Bogong, and
had been Solicitor-General and Attorney-General.
He had attended the Federal Convention of 1897
and was working with Alfred Deakin on the
future Australian Constitution. Elected to the
first Federal Parliament, he was Attorney-
General from 1904-06 and would possibly have
been a Prime Minister had not the High Court
beckoned him. He sat on the High Court for
24 years and was Chief Justice in 1930 when
he was appointed Governor-General on the
Scullin Government’s recommendation and amid
a brief squall of protest. He lived that down
by the way he comported himself in the office,
and there was no more honored citizen when
the simple, dignified, alert little man stepped
down six years later. His scholarship was
enormous; he understood Chinese, French,
Russian and Greek, arid among other things
was an authority on the Bible. His finest
quality was h'is indulgence, displayed particularly
in his statements on the Jewish question.
Directing operations in the R.A.A.F.’s
new job of mapping Australia with the
help of radar, Squadron-Leader H. W.
Hannam is back from a tour of duty
in Africa and Britain with the R.A.F.
A pioneer of radar in the New Guinea
jungle, he later visited the United King-
dom oh a special mission to advise R.A.F.
research establishment and manufacturers
on the adaptation of radar components
for use in the tropics. As a representa-
tive of the C.S.I.R. he went to Canada
and installed radio and radar aids to
navigation for demonstration at the Mon-
treal P.1.C.A.0. conference last year.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 80, Joseph R. Richardson,
former Adelaide City Engineer, who resigned in
1924 to enter private practice with his son in
Melbourne. A member of the Institute of Civil
Engineers, London, he was a qualified muni-
cipal and water-supply engineer and also a
mining and land surveyor.
At West Wickham (Eng.), Rev. William J.
Saville, for 35 years a missionary on Mailu,
Papua. He retired in 1935.
In Adelaide, at 60, James Bruce Murdoch,
fruit- and citrus-grower of Waikerie, and direc-
tor of the Waikerie Co-operative Fruit Packing
Coy. He was former chairman of the State
Advisory Board of Agriculture and the Federal
Government’s nominee on the Commonwealth
Dried-fruit Export Control Board for the past
13 years.
In Ballarat, at 55, Francis Alfred (Frank)
McCleave, soap manufacturer, breeder of
Shorthorn stud stock and director of Ballarat
Woollen and Worsted Co.
In Melbourne, at 77, Rev. Father Patrick
McGrath, S.J., parish priest of St. Ignatius,
Richmond, who came to Australia in 1910 after
studying in Ireland and the south of France.
In Brisbane, at 30, Tasman Thor Long, swim-
ming and surfing champion who gained the
Australian senior surf title in 1937-38. For
31 years he was a p.-0.-w. in Malaya.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Pookie”: Always democratic, Sydney
“D.T.” has opened its Mr. McNicoll’s
column to a variety of “guest” columnists
during the holiday absence of that übi-
quitous man-about-town, poet, etc,
“Guests” include the United States
Ambassador, a “London host” and the
doorman at the Australia. Most of them
have “made a good fist of it, but it is an
interesting fact that the writer who has
most faithfully reflected the usual tone of
the column, indeed of mefst daily
columnists, and in fact of Sydney daily
journalism in general, is Mr. Mick Daw-
son, doorman at the Australia Hotel.
There is a plain danger that all highly-
paid posts on dailies will be occupied by
J,doormen and waiters, and there is not
much evidence to suggest that anyone will
be a whit the worse off for that.

“Uco”: In an effort to convince the
Great American Public that he is still
one of the boys and that translation to
the White House has not given him
notions of grandeur, the President often
resorts to strange devices. When one of
the Australian lads attending the New
York “Herald Tribune’s” Forum visited
Washington he was presented with a pen
inscribed “I swiped this from Harry Tru-
man.” I suppose the idea is to show that
the President hasn’t lost the common
touch, but it reminds me irresistibly of
the publican who engraves on his
schooners “Stolen from Bung’s Hotel.”
• * ♦ * *
“Ex-Gilgai”; Immfired as lam in the
city, nothing cheers me more than to
discover that the gentle art of leg-pulling
is still practised outback. Imagine my
joy when a city paper seriously informed
me that a Mr, W. Gall, of “Langawirra,
60 miles north-east of Broken Hill,” had
bought an Auster aeroplane to “shadow
waterbirds to their secret waterholes in
drought-time,” and that a Mr. Peter
Brown, who apparently sold the plane,
had said;
Waterbirds puzzle graziers in drought
periods. While sheep die in hundreds from
lack of water swans and ducks fly over-
head on fixed courses. Graziers have ridden
for hours on horseback, and combed the
open country by station-wagon, but they
rarely find the waterholes the birds head
for. Mr. Gall will be able to trail the
birds, map the position of the waterholes
and later send his flocks to the spot.
If that item ever reaches the outback it’ll
open a grin wider than the Murray
mouth,

“C.P.R.”; Years ago I was bothered
by a passionate plant-fancier (8..
/11/2/’4B) whose emotions ranged from
! a sort of frustrated rage to sad patience as
|he eyed my lackadaisical gardening. My
principle was to heave in vegetable-seeds
in the vegetable section and flower-seeds in
j the floral section, water the lot and hope
for the best. Though I mostly knew what
veges I had, half the time I couldn’t tell
whether the daisies were Shastas or ever-
lastings or even whether they were
daisies —a dahlia to me was a dahlia,
nothing more. All I wanted was greenery
and color, and generally I got it, which
only exasperated the passionate one the
more. The end came when, excitedly
discovering a grey, thorny bush bearing
a pale-golden buttercup sort of blossom
in my west corner, he demanded its
name. “They’re gaudalanas,” I said
firmly. Deeply moved, he admired the
things and wondered where I had got the
seed. I muttered some fib or other, and,
at his request, gave him a few blossoms.
Our intercourse ceased from the day he
took the blooms to the Department of
Agriculture and learned that the plant
was “Mexican poppy,” a noxious weed.

“Plop”: On some Sydney footpaths
the word “Hot” has been appearing
lately, referring to little squares of
asphalt, set by the council men to replace
worn patches. Nothing remarkable about
that, but the chalked legend has given
at least one new slant on the old gag
of mankind’s weakness for testing the
truth of “Wet Paint” notices. Heading
south along Pitt-street, the man in front
of me saw the notice, disengaged his arm
from his lady’s and, stooping, applied his
“Dear Sirs: Re our application for supply of office furniture...."
thumb to the screenings. “Scorching,” he
observed.

“Ess”; Before the war whenever I
bought a hair-brush it was reasonably
pliable. When I joined up the Army
issued me with a “brush, hair,” the
bristles of which were like spikes of cor-
rugated-iron ; like many others, I used
it for removing mud from boots. On
discharge I attempted to buy a good hair-
brush, but found that the Army-style had
definitely caught on. All that was offer-
ing were brushes with plastic bristles that
ploughed harshly into the scalp, brushes
with bristles like wire, and brushes that
would have been more suitable as pot-
cleaners. Who started this idea that the
human scalp should be curry-combed like
a horse’s coat?
* * * *
“D.H.”: I beg “Youanmi’s” pardon,
but as one who delves into the study of
the structure, function and development
of animals, 1 disagree with his statement
(B. 4/2/’4B) that the drongo is “any
oscine bird of the family Syrphidce.” On
the contrary, the drongo is of the family
of Old World passerine birds known as
Dicruridce. Syrphidce consist of cyclor-
rhaphous dipterous flies, such as Syrphus
and allied genera. Thank you!

“Fons”: Overheard in a city post-office
one Saturday morning: “What’ve you
got there? Registration? Twelve par-
cels? At twenty to twelve? Don’t you
know we knock off at twelve? You’ll
have to tell your boss to send them over
before twenty to twelve. Forty-hour
week now, you know.” He registered
’em, but I got the impression it would
be the last time he’d oblige.
* * * *
“J.F.”: One of the bnght spots of
an unspectacular Army career was my
brief spell as Brigadier’s runner on board
the Aquitania, just out of Bombay. It
was my pleasant privilege to be present
—under a sort of convention of invisi-
bility—while the Brig, ticked off prac-
tically every junior officer in turn. Stand-
ing behind the Brig. I was able to smirk
insolently at my superior—who, poor
devil, stood rigidly at attention, not dar-
ing to do other than stare blankly before
him. For a private soldier there is, prob-
ably, no higher bliss. But I lost my job
by presumption. During Ship’s Rounds
it was my task to arrive at a battalion
“parade ground” just a little ahead of
the Brig, and warn the batt. C.O. The
C.O. would then call the parade to
attention as the Brig, arrived. For some
reason one morning I was crowded out
as we rounded the bend towards X bat-
talion. I saw a gap and scuttled through
■ —but the Brig, was only a step behind
me. Summoning all my breath I bel-
lowed, “X Battal-yun, Ten-shun!” and
as I panted after the last syllable the
Brig.’s voice informed me very precisely
of my error. But it was too late. The
battalion was at attention, and the Brig,
was there, and nothing could be done to
unfix the situation. I still treasure the
memory of the startled, resentful glance
the C.O. shot me as he came unwillingly
to attention.
* * * *
“Mickerman”: Not only American
filmsmiths abuse the English language ;
civil servants with their “depersonneli-
sation of forms” and like barbarities are
great offenders. No one today says
goods are scarce ; they remark that com-
modities are in extremely short supply.
Things are never “used carefully” by
people, but “utmost caution is exercised
in their use.” It is not clear to me why
such clumsy groups of words should be
needed to express simple ideas. My
generation interchanged its ideas quite
well, and in ordinary speech contempo-
raneous with my adolescence it was not
incumbent upon us to introduce grandilo-
quent phraseology and devious circum-
locution into our mundane colloquial-
isms. Or, if you prefer it, we got along
with shorter words then.
* * * *
“Chevroford”; When Norman Martin,
the Victorian Agent-Gteneral, saw the
flower- and fruit-laden tables at a Par-
liament House luncheon in his honor he
cited current London prices, including
£5 10s. for a pineapple and 255. for a
peach. Pineapples were always expensive
in the Great Smoke; hostesses used to
hire them for the evening as a decora-
tion. A man of my acquaintance, invited
to such a dinner, was asked if he would
like some fruit. “I’ll have a piece of
pineapple, thanks,” he said. There was
an embarrassed silence. “Don’t bother,”
he said, ‘Til cut it,” and he suited his
action to his word in the midst of a
silence pregnant with tragic feeling.

“Veecee”: Among other peculiarities
of Perth trams is a rule that passengers
desiring to alight must not signal the
driver; they must catch the conductor’s
eye and give him the nod. On a Mel-
bourne tram recently a Perth lass was
relieved to recognise a landmark near
her stopping-place and turned to bestow
on the conductor a beam and a nod in
the approved Westralian style. She was
rewarded with a broad wink, but the
tram kept going.
* * * *
“Ack-Y-Ack”: In the Ballarat Botani-
cal Gardens there are two rows of busts
of Prime Ministers of Australia. The
other day the bust of Priminister Chifley
made an unheralded appearance — minus
pipe. Locals are a little puzzled why
there was no public announcement of the
erection of the bust. Some profess to
see significance in the fact that Victorian
Premier Hollway lives about half a mile
from the bust, but as against that, the
P.M.’s henchman, Pollard, is Federal
member. There must be some reason
for sticking the thing up in the “wee
sma’ ” hours when nobody was about. In
one of the rows of Prime Ministers is
a statue of Spring. It took the local
historical society quite a lot of trouble
to convince Ballarat that the lady depicted
was Spring and that the basket of fruit,
in which she has one hand, did not
represent a distribution of plums at Can-
berra.
“F.S.”: I see that Mr. Chifley has con-
sented to sit for his official portrait for
King’s Hall, Canberra, and a panel ot
artists has been drawn up, one of whom
will be commissioned. I would advise
him to select his own painter, and to
choose not an artist whose work he likes
but one whose work he doesn’t like. Tens
of thousands of official portraits have
been painted, but few have survived their
subjects. Some very bad portraits have
lived because their subject Was a great
man like Shakspeare or a great sailor
like Nelson, but portraits of beggars,
obscure Jews and ladies of easy virtue
have survived because they were painted
by Titian or Rembrandt. If the P.M. is in
the category of the great man his portrait
will survive even if it is painted by the
sort of artist who fulfils the current
fashion. If he isn’t he has no hope of
survival unless he selects a great painter
to record his pipe and other features,
and his only chance of doing that is to
choose someone who doesn’t fulfil the
prevailing fashion and who therefore
wouldn’t please him.

“Tom”: Australia’s system of book
censorship is illogical right enough (B.
28/1/’4B). Here’s an example. Once I
asked for the Decameron at Sydney
Public Library, and was told it wasn’.t
issuable, even in Italian, as it was on the
Customs Department banned list. I
thereupon looked up a 16th-century
volume containing the Decameron, and
additional tales by Bandello, Margaret of
Navarre and other early Continental
storytellers—a book well known to
students of Shakspeare as having served
him and other dramatists of the time as
a storehouse of plots. Its title gives no
indication of its contents. The book was
available for the asking.

“A.A.H.”: In this Atomic Age I
thought old wives’ tales were laughed at,
but a few days ago in a chemist’s shop I
saw two young girls buying camphor
squares to put on their chests as a pro-
tection against infantile-paralysis germs.
“All the kids' down our way are wearing
camphor,” was the explanation given.
But what I think takes the prize sardine
was the advice given to a woman doctor
by her Irish mother: that on the nights
preceding her examinations she must
sleep with her text-books under the pil-
low. She declared the trick never* failed
to bring the desired results.

“Mullum”: The present cuts in our
newspapers remind me. Mail was scarce
at our base on the n.-w. coast, and read-
ing-matter non-existent. Imagine our joy
when, unpacking a case of stores, we
found a complete newspaper. Not a
skimpy war-time paper but a real, pre-
war Thursday-afternoon daily. Certainly
it was a few years old, but there was a
sheet for each of us and then a couple
left over. I’ll bet no woman studied
those Friday - morning bargains as
thoroughly as we did. I vowed I’d never
again throw those newsless pages away,
but it seems that it will be some years
yet before I have the chance.

“Hello”; He lurched up to me at the
Cross and in a beery voice said “Where
d’y’ get the bus for the city, Dig?” I
pointed to the stop on the other side of
the road. “Well, I don’t want it,” said
the intoxicated one. “Then why did you
ask me?” I replied. “ ’Cos I want that
flamin’ post you’re leanin’ on ’cos I’m
drunk,” came the answer, I gave up the
post.

“Zake’Vt Large and aggressive of mien,
the traffic cop, impatient at the tardiness
with which the old tourer came up to the
yellow crossing-lines at his back, slammed
up a hamlike fist, roared the mild-looking
driver back over the line, turned and
gave the right-of-way to pedestrians. Tie
last of them over, he turned and im-
periously waved on the motorist, who
was, on the slight incline, “riding the
clutch.” The tourer, which was still the
only car at the crossing, chugged forward.
Opposite the cop the driver held up his
hand in the very correct signal, and
stopped. Then pointedly he gazed down
at the cop’s outsize trilbies, looked astern,
slammed her into reverse, backed a few
yards, then came forward again, taking
an exaggeratedly wide sweep around the
traffic man. Opposite him again the
driver let his eyes rove over the cops
ukelele cases, then looked up with a
friendly smile. “Couldn’t take the risk of
runnin’ over ’em,” he said. “Might cap-
size—got a case of eggs in the back,
And on he chugged.
BORDERLINE JOKES.
“Reports presented to the Parliamentary Com-
mittee on Broadcasting, how sitting in Sydney,
emphasise that Australian radio programmes are
marked by horror serials, the vulgarity of ‘smart-
alec’ announcers and borderline jokes.” i
You fellows whose job is providing the fare
For the radio programmes we get on the air,
Who draw up the menus intended, one feels,
For what may be termed intellectual meals,
Who furnish the courses of what, you compute,
Is full of enjoyment—and profit to boot,
There’ll never be perfect agreement on what
Good taste may be held to prohibit or not,
But note that you’re bidden beware of the blokes
Who capture attention with borderline jokes.
These serial horrors of rapine and crime
Are doubtfully suitable stuff for the time
When eventide sessions are set to begin
And kids are the likeliest listeners-in.
Here’s meat that’s too strong, you hear someone
complain,
For immature Eric and juvenile Jane.
But a feature provoking more sinister looks
From moralists’ eyes than the capers of crooks
Is the vogue of allegedly humorous folks
Who base their appeal upon borderline jokes.
“Smart-alec” announcers! How better describe
The pranks of this blatantly voluble tribe,
The wisecracking coves whom you find upon
deck
To give you, too often, a pain in the neck?
But these are inferior evils perhaps
To what we are asked to endure from the chaps
Who bound on the stage with assurance so spry
And a satyr-like wink in the tail of the eye
To get their attraction from all that evokes
A grin or a giggle in borderline jokes.
Cut out witticisms too “close to the knuckle,”
Although you may count them safe draws for
a chuckle.
Your hearers, you mustn’t forget, may include
Good people who frown at what hints at the
rude •
And whose eyebrows go up at the quips which
engender
Dark fears of what’s known as a “double-
intender.”
In spite of the proverb that bids us be sure
And certain that all things are pure—to the pure,
Paste this in your hats and put this in your
smokes,
There’s definite danger in borderline jokes.

T. THE R.


“Clooter”: I see by the papers that Mr.
Geoffrey Cohen has been telling us that
we spend so much time worrying about
the shortage of beer that we forget more
important things, even unto the shortages
of houses. Mr. C. considers this fact
to be a poor reflection on the Australian
way of life. “There are,” says he, “acute
shortages of essential things, from houses
to rat-traps, yet a seasonal shortage of
what is a luxury beverage is much over-
emphasised.” I’m a bit with the gentle-
man, for to anybody claiming to be in-
telligent the fact that ships can be made
idle, and a nation’s transport thrown into
confusion, because some
can’t get a mug of the nut-brown in his
lunch-hour is too sickening for words.
Yet it is true that beer so rules the land
that about the first thing any industrial
conciliator makes sure of is that the wage-
plugs can get the stuff. All the same, I
doubt if Mr. Cohen has ever had to fight
his way through a 5.45 p.m. bar crowd
or pay ss. for a bottle of beer or had to
face any sort of family or national festi-
vity condemned to drink orangeade or
tea. The gentleman is chairman of
Carlton and United Breweries,
* * * *
“Suberton”: The rubbish-tip of our
rather exclusive suburb is an abandoned
quarry, where a 40ft. rill of jam-tins,
bottles, vegetable-peelings, paper and an
occasional deadbeat gives promise of what
some day will be a valuable block of
land. But many quasi-valuable articles
occasionally come over the dump, old
perambulators, beds, stoves, all capable
of renovation at the hands of foragers.
Still, I was decidedly surprised to meet
“Will that be all, Sir ?”
Bloggs, a city man in a big way, prowling
around the dump. Realising the implica-
tions he hastened to explain. “Don’t get
me wrong—blame Chifley! It’s that gas-
producer outfit I had. When they eased
up the petrol a while back I just brought
the car to the edge of the quarry,
loosened a few bolts and let her go. Now,
rationing’s worse than ever. Well, I’ve
got an idea it was just about here the
outfit landed?” I left him to it: a per-
sistent dump-forager myself, I knew that
his gas-outfit must be by now a good 10ft.
under along with a dozen more that I
had seen dumped during that happy
optimistic period when petrol seemed to
be right back.
* * * «
“IF.”: We had been at sea, sub.-
hunting over a big area in heavy fog and
rain for a week without catching so much
as a glimpse of the sun, moon or stars
and with our plotting-table broken down,
so nobody knew within a hundred miles
or so where we were. Ey guesswork we
reckoned on being about 900 miles E.
by N. of Durban, so set a course and
kept going. By Saturday morning we
reckoned we should be near the coast
when we ran into a big break of the rain,
and there was a fully-loaded tramp flat-
out doing about five knots. It was
quicker to ask her than work it out, so
over went the signal, “Where’s Durban,
chum,” as we raced up at 25 knots. Back
came the answer, “Follow me, I am going
there.” After a tactful message that we
were in a hurry, she told us Durban was
20 miles that way, and altered course
slightly. An hour and a half later the
skipper was at the Durban races,

“R.W.”: In an address to the Royal
College of Physicians at the Guildhall
Mr. Churchill advanced the idea of
setting aside days to commemorate the
great discoveries made for all mankind.
He added “Nature, like many of our
pjodern statesmen, is prodigal of pain,
and I should like to find a day when we
could take a holiday, a day of jubilation
for good St. Anaesthesia and the chaste
and pure St. Antiseptic.” He continued
that he himself would feel bound to cele-
brate, among others, St. M. & B. and St.
Penicillin, “both invaluable figures to
whom I was introduced during the war
in good time by Lord Moran, and with-
out whose benediction I might be regard-
ing your present troubles, if not other-
wise preoccupied, front a more serene
sphere.”
* * * *
“F.S.”: Melbourne National Gallery’s
latest acquisition, per bounty of the
Felton Bequest, is “The Passage of the
Red Sea,” a seven- by six-foot canvas
by Nicholas Poussin depicting the Chosen
People making the celebrated crossing.
It cost £14,000, and it is to be hoped it
won’t be another white elephant like the
enormous drawings of Chardin which took
up more space than their artistic merit
justified and had ultimately to be rele-
gated to an outer staircase. Poussin was
Louis XIII’s Court painter who was
driven to Rome by the jealousies of
fellow-artists. He specialised in vast his-
torical subjects, especially Old Testament
stories. He was anathema to the Impres-
sionists, and Cezanne made the tart com-
ment about him: “We must do Poussin
over again from Nature.”
* * * ♦
“Flathead”; “F.S.” is rash to declare
that he’ll swallow any camera nominated
(B. 11/2/’4B) if one does not find “each
piece” of a cut-up Rembrandt “as perfect
a composition as the whole picture.” He
couldn’t have picked a worse example
than Rembrandt. Applying his jigsaw-
puzzle technique to a lot of that artist’s
work one would merely find lop-sided
slivers of face, and large areas of darkness
whose equal in beauty could be found
in asphalt. Composition depends largely
on the shape of the canvas—what looks
excellent in an oblong can be an eyesore
in a circle. Rembrandt used to plan his
compositions to fit the area of his canvas,
so that, as a whole, it would look the
goods. In defence of the snubbed camera-
men, I say that composition is every bit
as vital in photography as in painting and
often harder to achieve ; the artist can do
a lot of underhand form-juggling while
the snapper can merely blackout the bad
bits on his masking-board.
* * * *
“Jasby”: I am used to reading of new
wonders evolved by Russian scientists —
of sheep that shed their wool once a year
to save the cost of shearing; of cows
fitted with false teeth ; of bees trained to
visit only one type of flower so that the
apiarist can turn on at will clover-honey,
sunflower-honey or stinkwort-honey—
and I expect any day to read that Pro-
fessor Nuttski has crossed buckwheat
with Mexican jumping beans, thus pro-
ducing a grain that will strip itself and
hop into the silo of its own volition.
But when the Comrades talk of producing
the fastest racehorse in the world by
crossing blood-mares with wild donkeys
“He loves playing duets'"
from Central Asia I think it’s time we
asked them to give us our legs back.
A mule’s a mule no matter how wild his
father was, and if the punting proletariat
in Moscow is going to fall for that story
the Soviet State Bookies are going to do
a lot of collecting. One thing, though:
the Russian Stud Book should be an easy
one to keep—unless those scientists find
a way of breeding from mules.
* * * #
“Findy”: I have a fellow-feeling for
“B. A. Ker” (B. 11/2/’4B) in his disil-
lusionment at finding that ..the Sioux
Indians properly answer to the name Soo.
In my boyhood when I thrilled to tales
of Buffalo Bill and the redskins I always
thought of them as Syoxes. The radio,
to its shame, has put us right on that one,
but a few years ago Hollywood dealt a
similar blow to the mispronunciation of
the name of another Injun tribe. When
I speak of Fenimore Cooper’s classic,
The Last of the Mohicans, I still pro-
nounce it Mo-icuns, yet throughout the
film of that name the characters—and I
presume, being Americans, they should
know—called the blighters Mo-fee-cuns.

“Bethune”': With unorthodox remedies
for “incurable” diseases now enjoying a
public airing let me quote one that offers
hope to rheumatoid-arthritis sufferers.
Dr. Imre Barsi, of Budapest, wrote in the
“British Medical Journal” a few months
ago of a new treatment he had originated.
He had noticed that women suffering
from rheumatoid arthritis showed con-
siderable improvement when pregnant,
and it occurred to him that blood trans-
fusions from an expectant mother might
be of benefit to other victims of arthritis.
He tried out his theory and claimed some
prompt and seemingly permanent cures.
In South Africa during November the
treatment was tried on Nick van den
Bergh, ex-heavyweight boxing champion
of the Union. He had been crippled by
rheumatoid for 17 years. After one
transfusion he showed remarkable im-
provement, and according to latest re-
ports his doctor does not think further
transfusions will be necessary.
* * * *
“Flip”: Billy, a goat originally im-
ported for his liking of blackberry bush,
had felt ambitious and was half-way
through the roses —the lady next-door
was in tears as I went to her assistance.
After re-tethering him I was in a position
to vouch that goats use the wrong brand,
and that, unprovoked, they are peaceful
to the extent of giving friendly little
nudges while you tend them. This habit
imparts a weird tang on your clothing ;
in my case the scent began growing
weaker only after the clothes had been
hung for a month in the sun. After six
weeks my nostrils could detect nothing
and I decided that it was safe to take the
clobber to the dry-cleaners; what I did
not realise was that living in daily range
of Billy had probably burned out my
olfactory nerve. Quite casually I dumped
them on the counter. The lass behind it
sniffed, turned to her cobber, and asked:
“You seen ‘Something in the Wind,’
Mildred? Great picture.”
“Bo”: “E.J.’s” inability to recall hear-
ing Tauber take a high C (B. 11/2/’4B)
constitutes a poor argument that he never
did. High C is well within the compass
of any true tenor. Rubini and Caruso
could even get to high F without undue
strain, and many present-day singers, in-
cluding Gigli and Bjorling, can take D
and E, as undoubtedly Tauber could.
On his only Australian tour Tauber,
though not classified as a robust tenor,
achieved quite a respectable volume on
high C in operatic numbers—and that
spectacular note in opera is almost in-
variably taken at full throat to get the
necessary apex of the dramatic surge
which composers, especially of the Italian
school, aimed for. The reason why
Tauber was heard less often singing for-
tissimo in the stratospheric register was
that a big proportion of his record-
ings were of Mozart opera and the
lied, which call more for the
polished and well-controlled voice
than for vocal pyrotechnics. As for
“Old Australian’s” doubt whether
an Italian could possibly pronounce
“love” as “ypve” 1 refer him to
Dino Borgioli’s singing of Hage-
man’s “Do Not Go, My Love.”
The title is repeated at least twice
during the song, and Borgioli’s re-
iterated “yove” was a joke among
Sydney Con. audiences a few years
ago. The initial consonant “1,”
native to his own tongue, appar-
ently trips the Italian, and to a
lesser degree the German, singing
in English when the following
vowel is either an “i” or an “o,”
as in “line” or “love.” All singers
hate the “i” or the “o” on a high
register, whereas “e” and “oo” are
welcomed. A word such as “lute”
might present difficulty to the Latin
singing in English, but “leave”
might be managed fairly easily.
“Brolga”; Harry, the Young Digger
who delivers groceries for several shop-
keepers in our suburb, is often prevailed
upon to do odd jobs during his rounds,
but he was floored when Miss Forty-Five
said, “Harry, I’m going away for a week.
There are a lot of mice in this block —
though, of course, none have ever got
into my flat. I’ve bought eighteen mouse-
traps and I was wondering if you’d set
them for me.” “Well,” said Harry, “I’ll
set ’em for you if you want me to, but
have you ever smelt a mouse that’s been
dead a week? What if you catch
eighteen?” Paling noticeably, the lady
changed her mind.
* * *
“Uramao”: Sydney-Melbourne rivalry
is not more intense than that between
Alexandra and Clyde, Central Otago
townships with populations pot running
above three figures. Clyde has an under-
taker, but Alexandra is minus that func-
tionary. A grey-bearded old patriarch of
Alexandra, urged to make his will and
think more of his last end, declared that
he was determined that as long as Alex-
andra was without an undertaker he
would not die —such an indignity as being
buried by the rival town’s body-snatcher
was repellent to him*
* * * *
“T.L.W.C.”: Strange tales are coming
out of New Zealand about the finding of
skeletons of tall, blonde men in the
Raglan sandhills of North Island. A
couple of years ago several skeletons
found there were, after the usual specu-
lation and inquiry, accepted as Maori
remains. The new bones, however, are of
men 6ft. to 7ft. tall; some skulls
had fair hair and congealed blood on
them ; the skeletons were either in coffins
or wrapped in rugs and mats, and among
them were buttons, a pair of scissors,
knives and an old clay cuddy. There
are no stories of shipwreck, massacre or
cannibal feasts attached to the area, and
the most likely theory is that they were
buried by some ship’s crew long since
scattered and forgotten.
V * * *
“Mr. Dribble”: An American author,
Robert Payne, in a novel queerly titled
A Bear Coughs at the North Pole, pro-
pounds a theory that nothing is insigni-
ficant. Even the trivial displacement of
air caused by the bear’s breathing may
have far-reaching consequences, which
may in time gather such momentum that
a nation may be set in flames. This theory
supplied me with a lucid explanation of
the overseas trouble. There is enough
displaced air at Canberra to start an-
other world war.
* * * *
“Plop”: Outstanding ability at billiards
or snooker is traditionally ascribed to “a
misspent youth.” A non-expert myself,
I’ve always drawn consolation from the
thought, but I saw something last week
in a Sydney saloon that shook me. Just
as I entered, a plump citizen of about
50 moved to the table, sighted up, and
began a massacre. He sank the remain-
ing two red balls, and with them blacks,
then potted the six colored balls in order.
Then, putting up his cue, he donned his
hat, adjusted his cleric’s collar and slipped
out the side door.
A SEASONABLE QUERY.
“Remarking on the likelihood of two exceptionally
strong' batting sides meeting in this year’s Tests,
Walter Hammond asked; ‘Who is going to get
everybody out V ”
With scores ever topping past records by far
And centuries common as blackberries are,
With wickets progressively slower to fall
And the bat ever getting the best of the ball,
I venture it goes without saying, or should,
That players who’re likely to do the most good
In the matter of putting opponents to rout
Are, firstly, the chaps who get other chaps out.
/
It’s these who win matches and furnish the cause
Of fewer admittedly wearisome draws.
They can come to the rescue, with things look-
ing ill
For their comrades, by vigor qnd cunning and
skill,
These doughty exponents of spin and of swerve,
Yet how seldom we give them the due they
deserve!
You read of great innings, but little about
Great outings by chaps who get other chaps out.
The batsmen are pelted with laurels and bays,
Prize packets of plaudits and paeans of praise,
For fireworks are what the spectators desire
And here they can count on the stuff they
require,
The cut and the drive, the ball picked off the
toes
To baffle the fieldsman, wherever it goes,
All these are acclaimed with a boisterous shout,
But what of the chaps who get other chaps out?
They stay in the background. Their work, it’s
allowed,
Has no such appeal for the thrill-craving crowd,
1 hough their craft and their guile, it can scarce
be denied,
Hold quite as much value, or more, for their
side.
Since matches no longer depend on the tons
Of notches recorded, these orgies of runs,
From the dexterous snick to the full-blooded
clout
That rattles the pickets, are useless without
Some chaps you can trust to get other chaps
out.

The near-gilt-edged quality of shares in
sound, old-established and progressive
insurance offices puts them high in the
investment category. Their equity status
makes them attractive as a long-term in-
vestment by reason of the policy of profits
allocation, which ensures strong reserves
—in this case built up during three-
quarters of a century of careful
trading—and, at intervals, the issue of
bonus scrip and increase in the amount
distributed as dividends. Mostly the
dividend charge is covered, or nearly
covered, by returns from a wad of Gov-
ernment and other sound securities, thus
leaving the underwriting surplus, or most
of it, available to swell investments and
returns therefrom.
Certainly underwriting runs into bad
patches at times, but overall the theory of
averages works well. Of recent years the
official pursuit of cheap money, control
of rents and steep rise in taxation have
reduced the net return from investments.
This, among other things, means a wider
spacing of benefits. And since the
Maoriland Government has given the
State Insurance Office a monopoly of
workers’ - compensation business, the
vexed question of nationalising the
Dominion’s big private insurance cos.
appears to have wisely passed into the
political background.
Shareholders in this 75-year-old Auck-
land-controlled fire, marine and accident
office, which has world-wide connections,
have reaped some rich harvests in the
past. Of the £1,031,640 of paid capital
£907,000-odd has come from reserves,
which at end August last stood at
£5,723,704—-it includes £1,720,000 for un-
expired risks —or 555 p.c. of paid capital.
Also the year’s net return from invest-
ments (£253,551, after deducting taxa-
tion) was only £4359 short of the in-
creased dividend charge of 25 p.c. Under
more settled conditions the time for
further gift-giving might be considered at
hand. It needs to be remembered, how-
ever, that since the war abnormal condi-
tions and rising values have sent premium
income up with a rush, while the loss rate
has remained moderate and a tight hold
has been kept upon exes., thus greatly
improving the underwriting surplus. Be-
cause such conditions are not expected
to last very much longer, the cautious
board obviously prefers to wait until the
outlook becomes less clouded before com-
mitting the co. to anything with a sting
in its tail, like the capitalisation of re-
serves.
Last term the co. further expanded its
connections, especially in the Asiatic and
island territories where it folded up fol-
lowing the lap invasion, and net premium
income shot up by £507,015. This com-
pares with a growth of £109,273 for the
previous term, and an average annual in-
crease of £238,877 during the five war
years to 1944, when a large volume of
marine business at high rates bumped up
the figures:

Other pleasing features are that last term’s
bigger business was written at £5 16s. p.c.
less cost and the loss rate, over which
management has no control, was £5 2s.
p.c. lighter. The underwriting surplus
benefited by £258,378, reaching £621,862.
Interest and rents turned in £253,551 (up
£44,147), making total profit £875,413.
That was before allowing for unexpired
risks, which on the usually-accepted 40
p.c. basis would reduce the underwriting
profit to £419,056 (up £99,282), and total
net profit to £672,607 (up £143,427),
which is equal to 65.5 p.c. on capital as
against 51.3 p.c. for the previous term.
The div. was lifted from 20 p.c. to 25 p.c.
The very solid protection for both
policyholders and shareholders is in this

When the books closed cash and deposits,

year’s loss claims by £167,196. It is an
exceptionally strong position.
The market, which is prepared to wait
for its benefits, prices the f,-p. 10s. shares
at 905., at which figure the immediate re-
turn is 2.8 p.c. on a 25 p.c. div. basis.
The investor at 90s. who looks for only
3.3 p.c. on his money counts on a 30 p.c.
div., or, say, a four Tor-two bonus scrip
issue and drop in the div. to 10 p.c.,
which would then call for £309,492 p.a.

It. was in 1930 that Carreras, Ltd. (Lon-
don), the prosperous English manufac-
turer of Craven A cigarettes, bought the
ords. of the old G. G. Goode business
in Melbourne at a substantial premium,
and, inside a decade, wrought wonders
with a business which had previously
done little more than lose money. Then,
in 1940, British Tobacco Co. bought the
£200,000 of Carreras’ ord. capital for
£1,463,335 in its own scrip—225,861
p.c, prefs., 618,737 ords. and a like
number of B ords., deferred as to return
of capital only. At B.T.’s present rate of
distribution (9 p.c. to the ords.), that lot
is costing £125,753 p.a. After deducting
its own pref. requirements, Carreras’ net
earnings averaged £103,813 for the seven
years to end October last. Thus, so far
as the big holding co. (8.T.) is concerned,
the deal has proved more of a hindrance
than a help to date.
Since Carreras entered the B.T. stable
the trouble has been that rises in the
price of American leaf, excise, wage and
other costs have more than offset the
gains from expanding consumption. Ex-
cepting a small increase in selling prices
as from the beginning of 1947, the only
growth in costs that the manufacturer has
been able to pass on has been the lifts in
excise. The following table, compiled
from figures published by the Common-
wealth Statistician, shows what has hap-
pened :

* Value added during manufacture.
The drop in the value of output per per-
son (i.e., value added during manufacture,
excluding cost of raw materials) and the
increasing proportion of that value
gobbled by expanding pay-roll totals have
robbed net earnings of the buoyancy that
normally goes with bigger turnover.
Although the price of American leaf
last term was below the 1946 level, ap-
pearances are that but for abolition of
War-time (Co.) Tax the year’s net earn-
ings would have been substantially below
instead of £4319 above the previous
year’s figure. The £111,367 of profit
claimed covered the pref. div. (£6800) and
20.9 p.c. on the half-million ord. capital,
compared with 20, 26.1, 29.3, 21, 18.5
and 29.2 p.c. back to 1941. The div.,
which had come down in halting steps
from 71 p.c. in 1941 to 19 p.c. in 1946,
Was lifted to 23 p.c.
As for the current term, one difficulty
will be to maintain turnover, owing to
the recent Government cut of 20 p.c, in
tobacco imports from U.S. in an effort to
save dollars. Locally retail quotas have
already been cut by 10 p.c., and might
yet be reduced further. Another diffi-
culty will be to check the continued rise
in costs, following introduction of the
40-hour week and all-round lift in price
of everything the co. uses.

largely reflects reduced purchases of

was £10,370 less than at the previous
balance.

It is difficult to say exactly what the
future holds for this co. Its worsted cloth
and other productscompare veryfavorably
with similar-grade goods on the market.
Good worsteds are in short supply at the
moment, and seem likely to remain so
for another year or more. The danger is
that when the present backlog of demand
is overtaken the co.’s competitive power
might be handicapped by heavy overhead,
owing to the position of the mills—
Albury, Orange and Goulburn. Much
will depend upon the condition of thfe
plant, and upon whether the Government
is prepared to give more than lip-service
to the decentralisation plank of its policy
by granting the co. adequate rail-freight
concessions. In the aggregate the co.'s
transport charges place it at a heavy dis-
advantage compared with metropolitan
mills. Plant is reported in good order
and efficient; some of the new machines
on order from Britain have arrived, and
delivery of the balance is expected dur-
ing the current term.
With the commendable aim of decen-
tralisation the co. set up in 1923, when
prices were inflated. Presently the col-
lapse of values, and other troubles, made
prospects look hopeless for a while. How-
ever, internal differences were patched
up, and £156,105 was lopped off capital
in 1929. On paper profits appeared in
1933, when shareholders got their first
div., 5 p.c., which was followed by 3f, 5,
nil and 5 p.c. Then disclosure of succes-
sive overvaluation of stocks showed that
the actual net result of trading for the
decade to close of accounts in 1938 was
a loss averaging £4BOO p.a. The facts
absolved the board from blame. In 1941
another cut (£55,158) was made in capital,
reducing it to its present figure, £239,075,
in 441,369 shares of 10s. lOd. each, and
making payment of a higher rate of
dividend than would be otherwise pos-
sible an easy matter.
Encouraging progress was made during
the war, when output was both stan-
dardised and assured of a ready market
at fixed prices under Government con-
tract, and progressive improvement in the
figures for the three years to the close of
last accounts is most heartening. The
results, however, have been won under
abnormal conditions of scarcity, and
cannot therefore be taken as a reliable
guide to the future.
Last term the improvement in mill
profit, etc. (£115,607), was £23,409, of
wtpch exes. (£66,676, including provision
for taxation) took only £4772, leaving the
net figure £18,637 stronger at £48,931.
That was 20.4 p.c. on capital as against
12.6, 11.5, 8.3, 11.7, 9.8, 14.9 and 12.7 p.c,
back to 1940. The div. was lifted from
9.23 p.c. to 12.3 p.c., making the average
9.4 p.c. over the last seven years. Abo-
lition of War-time (Co.) Tax represented
a saving of approximately £8250 (3.4 p.c.
on capital) in provision for taxation
(£28,314, down £174).

North Queensland tinmining should
prove important to that area. The Vul-
can, recorded as being 2\ miles from the
nearest surface granite, started in 1891
and finished about 1931 with an output
of 165,000 tons ore for a yield of 8300

and ore at 1200 ft. Among
others, it was reported upon by
Government geologist Cameron
about 1913, and mentioned by
mining engineer Herman in a
paper on Australian tin lodes
in 1914. Mention was also made
in a recent overseas article on
Australian pipe deposits by
Roland Blanchard, of Mt. Isa
Mines, Ltd. O. H. Woodward,
formerly g.-m. and now a direc-
tor of North Broken Hill, had
early experience in these N.Q.
tin areas. Some years ago a
summary of Cornish tinmines
listed up to 1000 to 1500 feet as
the usual vertical limits of tin
ores in either altered sediment-
ary or primary granite rocks, or
in each where the lode passes
from the former rocks into the
latter. Some copper lodes near
such contacts were viewed
favorably for tin occurring in
depth with a possible poor zone
between the two ores. Apart
from present high prices for tin,
these N.Q. tin areas still appear
to offer scope for further test-
ing.

Westralian Prospectors’ Asso-
ciation has fired its first shot in
a war against prolonged gold-
mining exemptions by backing
two objectors to an application
for further exemption by a
Coolgardie co. The ground in
question has not been worked
for 20 years, the objectors, say.
Big areas of auriferous country
are still held under exemption,
chiefly by London cos, which
have spent their capital, some
foolishly, and are unable to raise
more or get outside financial
assistance.

that to economically treat the

essential that throughput be in-
creased to 6000 tons per four-
weekly period. By treating this
quantity of l.Tdwt. ore with a
residue value of o.2dwt.,
Blackett estimates that all-in
costs would be reduced to 4s. a
ton and profits would average
£l5OO a month. Capital expen-
diture to achieve this is put at
£7OOO. Co.’s mine is near

“Oiler”:
Air-compressors, particularly small
ones suited to prospecting shows, are
hard to come by. If an engineer can
be found to do the job, an old car
motor or suitable diesel or other
engine may be converted to compress
air. The principle is to fill up the
head chambers with metal and to
have the valves working automatically.
With bores up to 4in., outlets are
satisfactory up to |in. diameter, but
if reduced below that to the receiving
tank restriction is bound to be too
high. Inlets on a side-valve car motor
will work automatically without
alteration, if fitted with light springs
and if recesses are cut in the head
filling to allow valves to rise; outlets
are taken through the plug-holes,
which are reamed to a suitable size.
Specially-made outlet valves are seated
in opposite fashion to car valves, and
are spring-loaded. These machines
may be driven at around 600 r.p.m.,
and will work a single jackhammer
satisfactorily. A large receiving tank
is a definite advantage.

THE CHECK TO PRICES.
Inflation's Back Broken?
The crash in sharemarket
prices throughout the Empire
and the United States last week
was something that elements of
each community have been
awaiting for a couple of years.
Some, with a speculator’s out-
look, took the view that rising
prices had to fall some time;
others had been more seriously
perturbed about what was to
them little more than evidence
of the depreciation of their
currency reflected in higher
costs for almost everything, and
for which overspending by Gov-
ernments and underproduction
by the highly-paid trade-union
community were the principal
present causes, though the dis-
ruption produced by war in
British and Continental indus-
tries gave this disequilibrium its
initial shove.
The U.S. Position
To look at the picture as a
whole it is perhaps best toi start
from the United States. It is
here that world prices for grain
and metals have been set in open
market during the post-war
years. For some time Washing-
ton has been extremely per-
turbed about the constantly
rising prices throughout
America. President Truman
voiced alarm about it on several
occasions since price-control
was abandoned in 1946, and,
failing to get Congress to ap-
prove a reintroduction of price-
control, recently arranged for
alternative measures. Marriner
S. Eccles, president of the
Federal Reserve Board, late last
year said that the basic cause of
price-inflation in the U.S.A. was
too much money in circulation,
and suggested a restricted
Budget and credit policy as a
remedy.
Per capita consumption of
meat in America in 1947 was
about 1561 b., or 25 p.c. above
the pre-war average. Consump-
tion of eggs and poultry was
about 30 p.c. higher. This heavy
consumption at'home was
coupled with big Government
buying for the export trade.
Wheat was influenced most by
export demand, and it seemed
to set a standard for other food-
stuffs. The Government, too,
put a floor under farm-products
prices, and this enabled landmen
to bargain with more assurance.
The cost of food for a long time
has represented the hard frame-
work of the rising cost-of-living
edifice in the U.S.A., and until
it softened it was generally
agreed that it would be diffi-
cult to check the wage-price
spiral.
Recently it has looked as
though Europe might this sum-
mer have a good harvest, and
grain prospects in America have
improved. Then came reports
that U.S. Government buying of
wheat was to be curtailed, and
from Britain it was cabled that
it? reserve of dollars, gold and
other foreign exchange was
rapidly drying up—that dollar
and gold holdings at the begin-
ning of 1948 were down to £512
million sterling, which com-
pares with a trading deficit
within the dollar area of £626
million sterling in 1947 and
£340 million in 1946. With the
Marshall Plan still uncertain, it
occurred to Americans in a
rather sudden manner that buy-
ing by and on behalf of over-
seas Governments might be dras-
tically curtailed this year, and
the grain, meat and cotton mar-
kets took a dip the like of which
has not been seen since the U.S.
price-inflation got really under
way.
The New York Stock Ex-
change followed suit. But it
must be remembered that earn-
ings by U.S. corporations have
been billowing since the end of
the war. President Truman, in
his annual economic report to
Congress in January, said that
corporation earnings, after taxa-
tion, were double those of the
war years and four times those
of 1929. Production in all in-
dustry in 1947 was 76 p.c. above
the 1935-39 average. The slight
drop in agricultural production
was more than offset by output
in the manufacturing and build-
ing trades, transport services
and public utilities.
Plainly boom conditions were
operating in the United States,
even if production was still short
of demand, and the Stock Ex-
change based its prices upon
these conditions. It is natural to
assume that any recession in
prices will be reflected in the
profit-earning capacity of some
industries, even if only tempor-
arily, and the sharp fall in Wall-
street prices was thus under-
standable. But it must not be
forgotten that there is still little
or no real overproduction in the
United States, and that, whilst
it is desirable to check the un-
healthy wage-price spiral that
has been so disturbing to U.S.
economists and Congress, there
is little evidence yet that a busi-
ness slump.is in prospect, though
businesses and farms that have
been established or bought on
the basis of recent price-levels
may now find the going hard.
In industries where costs have
been allowed to creep up with
inflated prices there may also be
some sharp readjustments. But
industry as a whole is capable of
carrying on profitably, and prob-
ably with more stability, in a
future U.S. economy in which
prices and costs have ceased to
chase each other madly. Rising
prices mean loss of buying-
power, of money savings, pen-
sions and other fixed incomes,
such as from interest on war
bonds, as well Ss, in the long
run, a probable loss of capital
in war-loan investments.
The slump has merely “broken
the back of inflation,” said one
U.S. commentator. Another
person who should not be
unduly alarmed by what has
happened to prices in the United
States is Mr. Marriner Eccles.
In November he pronounced the
U.S. economy to be “caught in
a wage-price-profit-credit spiral,
acutely intensified by short farm
crops abroad and reduced corn
and cotton ,crops at home.” This,
and “an excessively swollen
money-supply” arising out of
“war financing and the enor-
mous Federal deficits,” were re-
garded by him as being the
source of the present inflation.
Mr. Truman may not be dis-
pleased with the check to rising
prices, either.
Paper-Money Prosperity
A feature of the high-price
era through which we have
been passing and which has only
been partly appreciated by the
community is that the “full-
employment policy” of Aus-
tralia, Great Britain and, to a
lesser degree, the United States
has brought little more than
paper-money “prosperity” to the
community as a whole. True,
traditionally breadline families
may have had a lift-up in real
living standards, but in Britain
particularly, and in Australia to
a lesser extent, the general liv-
ing standard has fallen since war
began.
Britain’s plight is deplorable,
and in Australia consumption of
meat, butter and milk products
(cheese excepted) per head has
fallen noticeably over 'the past
five years. This may be in con-
trast to United States experi-
ence, where per capita food con-
sumption has risen, but there
the supply of most other pro-
ducts is still lagging behind de-
mand.
The explanation of this posi-
tion is that production has not
equalled the output of paper
money and “credit” by Govern-
ments. There has been a world-
wide tendency for trade-
unionists to do less work ; and
it seems, at the present time,
that the worse a country is off
economically the less eager are
its people to do a fair day’s work
for fair pay. Pressure-group
politics, the vested interests of
trade-union Labor and the
treachery of Communist infiltra-
tion have all played their part in
the creation of a production de-
pression that has been veiled for
a period by paper-money “pros-
perity.” Socialistic Govern-
ments in Australia and Britain,
which have been stressing the
trade-unionist’s consumer angle
without equal emphasis on the
production side, have done
immeasurable damage to indus-
trial morale and the productive
mechanism of their respective
countries.
The rising prices; we have
seen have been evidence only of
this paper - money “pros-
perity.” The continued rise in
prices and wages was something
to be desired by no national-
minded, sane person. It has
been all too easy for Govern-
ments to create paper money and
credit as required to keep “em-
ployment” full in a payroll sense
only.
The setback we have seen
overseas in prices, or even a
levelling-off at the highest points
reached, is not likely to be a
permanent thing unless Govern-
ments generally say firmly “No
increases in wages without
higher production.” The one
exception to this may be metals
and farm products, where supply
and demand are more potent
factors in setting prices than is
the case with manufactured
goods, in which labor costs are
the most important influence,
Britain’s Plight
Britain’s plight is one in which
production has not recovered
sufficiently to provide an export
surplus capable of meeting the
cost of imports, mostly food and
raw materials. Coal output
lagged for a long period, and,
though production of motor-
cars rose to a record level, the
textile trades have not nearly
recovered pre-war capacity, and
overall production is unsatisfac-
tory.
The Socialist Government
is partly to blame in all this, but
the exhaustion of overseas re-
serves in financing war-time pur-
chases, the too-sudden ending of
American lend-lease and actual
war-damage’ of industry—too
often overlooked by critics in
countries which have suffered
little or nothing in that regard
—have all placed colossal handi-
caps in front of the Old
Country. Production per man-
hour in Britain has fallen,
which means that, in relation to
higher wages and money in-
comes being received by the
population, costs have risen
steeply and exports may become
unprofitable in relation to
world-market prices for, say,
French goods, France in her
desperation having begun to
monkey with her currency,
which may do no one any good
and many a lot of harm in the
long run.
Britain’s dollar and gold re-
serves, as mentioned, have
fallen to £512 million. Her
ability to maintain supplies of
food and raw materials from the
dollar area is fast deteriorating;
but in the United States it is
contended that these resources
will last until the Marshall Plan
starts to operate in July, when
Britain will be allocated (on pre-
sent plans) about £540 million,
to be spent over the ensuing 15
months.
Meantime there will be no
let-up in Australia’s export trade
to Great Britain, whatever world
prices may be for wool, wheat,
metals, dairy produce, etc.
What we receive in excess of
what we pay for British manu-
factures will be established as a
credit in London. Our total in-
debtedness to Great Britain is
still of the order of £SOO million
in Australian currency, and our
credit balances in Britain are
little more than a third of that
figure.
Australian Share Prices
In Australia we have seen this
paper-money prosperity, declin-
ing living standards and ever-
increasing living costs for several
years. The buying - power
of our pound note has been
dwindling as output per man-
hour and the number of hours
in the working week fell and
money wages rose. For years
past The Bulletin has advised
the investment of savings in
homes (where they could be
bought at pegged prices) and in
industrial ordinary shares on the
principle that these represented
real assets, or investment in real
assets, the paper-money value of

SPEED AND
ACCURACY
The first thing Pelmanism does is to
quicken the perceptions so that we
are more intensely aware of what is
around us and about us. In con-
sequence, there is a great access of
confidence in our ability to acquire
exact knowledge, remember it and
recall it as required. We learn to
trust our sense perception.
The way to development of inherent
qualities and aptitudes is then open,
and relatively smooth and easy for
the normal man and woman. The
more important of these qualities are
Observation Self-Confidence
Will-Power Judgment
Decision Organisation
Social Ease Concentration
and a THOROUGHLY
DEPENDABLE MEMORY
me exercises are pleasant and each
has its special purpose. The Pelman
Course is a real training, its primary
object being to create good habits
of mind and memory in place of
careless and slovenly ones, to train
the conscious and the subconscious
so that every faculty will, when called
upon, contribute its share in making
a good performance of anything that
has to be done.

which would rise as the cost of
replacement increased.
Recently prospective investors
have been warned that a set-
back was likely about Easter;
in pre-war years such a reverse
was almost an annual affair, the
slumps in March, 1936 (when
the Bank of N. S. Wales raised
its fixed - deposit rate), and
April, 1937 (when a U.S. rumor
was circulated, probably offi-
cially, that Roosevelt was going
to lower the price of gold), being
memorable examples. But there
is little to indicate that the
slump in the market seen last
week is likely to continue for
long, even if prices! do not fully
regain previous levels for some
time.
The sharemarket position in
Australia is in many respects
different from that in the United
States and Britain. There are
the same “economics o f
scarcity,” but in a different de-
gree ; there isn’t as much avail-
able production, per head, as in
the U.S.A. (where rationing
was abandoned long ago), or
as little as in Great Britain.
There has been greater price-
and profits - control than in
either country, and profits of
public companies have in no
way measured up to< the profits-
inflation seen in the United
States. Commonwealth Bank
statistics show that in 1947, for
the first time, profits of Aus-
tralian companies represented a
greater percentage on share-
holders’ funds than before the
war, though the increased cost
of living was in no way compen-
sated for. There is room for
considerable expansion of Aus-
tralian company earnings under
less rigid price-control.
It may be that wheat and
metal prices are in for some de-
cline, with wool not so vulner-
able. But if such declines are
compensated for by lower im-
port costs the effect on the Aus-
tralian economy may not be
very serious, especially as term
contracts cover some of our ex-
port products.
So far as investors in Aus-
tralian industrial shares are con-
cerned they should remember
that demand for most manufac-
turing production is still far in
advance of supply, that there
are prospects of extensive de-
velopment ahead, and that a re-
covery in productivity of the
nation should be to their ad-
vantage in the long run, as im-
proving living standards should
add to profit-earning capacity.
On the other hand, so long as
money, through the operation
of a misguided and much-
abused “full-employment policy”
and through 40-hour weeks and
the like, continues to be created
in excess of production, then the
cost of buying all real assets is
likely to rise, and equity shares
will be sought as investments.
And there is as yet little sign
that Canberra proposes volun-
tarily td abandon its cheap-
money policy, which has been a
factor in the demand for shares
paying a steady dividend.
No Golden Anchor
People should not forget that
the world is still undersupplied
with production,' and that many
things—such as housing—are
still years in arrears. In
contrast, there has been a vast
expansion in paper-money sav-
ings. in Australia, the United
Kingdom, New Zealand,
Canada, the United States and
most other countries. In the
countries mentioned the growth
has been in no case less than
150 p.c.—an unprecedented infla-
tion.
And no country is politically
keen on Budgetary deflation —
least of all those with Socialist
Governments; while New Deal
principles seem to be per-
manently grafted on to- the U.S.
political economy. The general
thing these days is to accept a
zero unemployment total as the
limit to credit and Budgetary ex-
pansion, and a distorted ver-
sion of this Keynesian theory has
invariably created more money
than goods to "date, with an ob-
vious effect upon prices.
There is no golden anchor to
credit-expansion today not
even in the United States.
Golden 10-dollar pieces are no
longer in circulation, and,
though the U.S. Treasury buys
all gold offered to it at $35 an
ounce—the same figure as in
1934, when prices for other
metals and commodities were
much lower than now—no over-
seas country is in a position to
buy gold from the Treasury at
that figure, all needing dollar
goods rather than gold.
If gold at it* fixed price were
allowed to exert its former in-
fluence upon credit and prices
it might soon produce a sharp
contraction in commodity prices.
But it seems certain that any
free gold market that might
operate on an international scale
in the future will only do so on
the basis of a higher gold price
in There is not likely to
be seen, in the U.S. or elsewhere,
a repetition of the Bank of Eng-
land’s policy of 1925, when the
gold standard was restored at
£4 ss. an ounce. There is not
the same political respect for the
gold value of Government loans
that there used to be, nor the
same regard for the rights of
creditors.
Price-control notwithstanding,
we must accept the view that a
large part of our war-time in-
flation is here for keeps, with
more to come, perhaps, on food
items' in Australia. Wars have
this inflationary effect—and we
have Communism and pressure-
politics as well. Looking
back to 1913, wholesale prices
in Australia were represented by
an index of 1088. At the out-
break of World War II the index
stood at 1665. The lowest in-
between figure was 1409, in the
depression year 1933.
Australian sharemarkets be-
gan to show definite signs of re-
covery last week-end. Some
rises were so strong —metal
issues excepted—that it appeared
many investors were prepared
to regard the whole thing as a
nasty dream. Still, there should
be a lesson in it all for specu-
lators' led by a rising market to
believe that the sky is the limit.

SUNDRY SHOWS
The Neglected
Composer.
Evidence given before the
Parliamentary Standing Commit-
tee on Broadcasting by sundry
musical authorities and, in par-
ticular, by Eugene Goossens,
permanent conductor of the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra
and director of the Sydney Con-
servatorium, has given unac-
customed publicity to Australian
compositions.
Goossens “discovered” John
Antill, whose “Corroboree,” the
most important piece of music
in larger form yet written in
Australia, has been acclaimed
overseas, though it has yet to be
heard in its entirety by Aus-
tralian audiences. The en-
couragement which this recog-
nition engendered has spurred
the composer to the writing of
a symphony and two other major
works, on which he is now en-
gaged.
Goossens told the committee
he considered several pianoforte
pieces by the 19-year-old Mel-
bourne composer Edward
Browne to be “the most brilliant
he had read for years”—and the
conductor doesn’t toss such
praise around lightly.
Australian painting' and litera-
ture have been endowed with
comparative richness, but music
has received little such en-
couragement.
Australia can boast of two
eminent composers, but they
didn’t do their composing here.
Percy Grainger is now a
naturalised American, and his
adopted country takes pride in
such compositions as “Shep-
herd’s Hey,” “Molly on the
Shore” ana “Country Gardens,”
which enjoy world-wide popu-
larity. Had he depended on en-
couragement from his native
land Grainger’s native talent
would assuredly have died of
pernicious anaemia. Roy Agnew
had to go overseas to be recog-
nised, while New Zealand-born
Alfred Hill, who has remained
in these parts, has not received
the recognition he merits.
But of late there have been
stirrings. As well as fostering
young talent on the interpreta-
tive side, A.B.C. is doing good
work in bringing to the public’s
notice short works of such com-
petent composers as Miriam
Hyde and Frank Hutchens. Clive
Douglas’s legend, “Jindarra,”
which says something freshly
and with imagination, was given
over the air last week with the
composer conducting. But our
composers need a better deal
yet.
The popular idea that native
talent in composing is in itself
sufficient, that it is just a matter
of a young genius getting an in-
spiration and sitting down
and composing must be dis-
pelled. Composing is a highly-
skilled trade, and has' to be
learned the hard way, Schubert,
who next to Mozart was music’s
supreme natural genius, was
acutely aware throughout his
short life of the disadvantages
to which inadequate instruction
in certain forms of composition
had exposed him.
Where the young Australian
composer can demonstrate be-
fore such competent authorities
as Goossens, Heinze and others
that he has the natural gift for
it he should be assisted in the
same way as are authors by the
Commonwealth Literary Fund.
The tragedies of Mozart and
Schubert, who were left to die
poverty-stricken their early
deaths contributed in’ no small
degree by actual hunger—by
a blindly unappreciative
people should never be paral-
Idled in this country, A Com-
monwealth Music Fund seems
the only alternative to liberal
endowment by wealthy citizens.
Tom Roberts.
A memorial exhibition of 90
pictures embracing most of Tom
Roberts’s art life was opened by
Premier Hollway at the National
Gallery in Melbourne. They
cover the period when Roberts
was purely the. child of his
National Gallery schooling
under Folingsby and Hall, the
period in Paris when he was in-
fluenced by the rising tide of
like Manet, Monet and
Sisley, the Eaglemont period,
when he tried to apply his influ-
ence to Australian landscape,
and the period when he produced
commissioned portraits, and the
big subject-pictures for which
he is most noted.
When Roberts looked at the
works of the men who were
struggling to get away from the
academic tradition and back to
Nature in Paris he was strongly
impressed by the light and air in
their pictures, and his success in
introducing light and air into
the Australian background is
shown in the little landscapes he
painted at the time of the
famous “nine-by-five” exhibi-
tion held in 1889 in Buxton’s
Rooms in Melbourne. There is
a freshness about them which
was wholly absent from the
painting of the previous schools.
“Shearing the Rams,” “The
Breakaway,” “Bailed Up” and
the other big subject-pictures
show not only technical skill,
drama and a love for the Aus-
tralian scene, but a certain
largeness of mind, comparable
to the sweep of Paterson’s
balladry, rarely found, since
Australian painting became
urbanised and proletarian. The
color alone of “The Breakaway”
is enough to demonstrate
Roberts’s influence on the early
Streeton.

"Message for
Margaret."
Phis drama in three acts and
six scenes, put on by the Mel-
bourne Little Theatre, hinges
round the question as to which
Margaret Mr. Hayden meant —
his wife or his mistress —when
he breathed the name with his
last gasp after being run over
in the streets of London, His
wife’s lifelong illusion is shat-
tered when it turns out that he
was referring to the mistress of
whom his wife had never heard.
The mistress’s illusion is shat-
tered when it turns out that
another word he used referred
to a memory of an earlier matri-
monial experience.
There is a lack of subtlety
about the presentation, especi-
ally where the wife, after
attempting to push her rival and
her unborn infant over a bal-
cony, offers to adopt the
souvenir of her dead husband
in order to save it from its
mother.
Margaret Reid, as the mistress,
placed an acid emphasis on her
selfishness, while Murielle
Heame played the wife, just as
possessive as her rival, in senti-
mental fashion.

a- public issue of the case, which,
although he doesn’t know it, in-
volves his daughter (Hazel
Court). Margaret Rutherford
(Madame Arcati in Coward’s
“Blithe Spirit”) enters the fray
as a warring grandmother. Tip-
top entertainment.

“The Upturned Glass” (Syd-
ney Esquire); James Mason, as
a doctor living apart from his
wife, saves the life of a small
child and falls in love with her
mother. Because her husband
hasn’t done anything to deserve
it, they separate, but the woman
is driven to suicide by a nagging
sister-in-law. Hell-bent o n
justice, Mason pushes the s.-i.-l.
out the same window and then
takes off himself from a lofty
cliff. There’s a lot of Mr.
Mason.

“Frieda” (Sydney Embassy):
The story of an English airman
who marries the German girl
who helps him escape, and takes
her home to his quiet English
village. The prejudices of the
villagers and the reactions of the
girl are feelingly represented,
although, towards the finish, the
film loses its drama in a discus-
sion of values. David Farrar
and Mai Zetterling have a fine
appreciation of the main roles,
with Flora Robson, as a Ger-
man-hating M.P., and Albert
Lieven, as an unchangeable
Nazi, turning in excellent per-
formances.
* * * *
“Theirs Is the Glory” (Syd-
ney Savoy): A documentary
record of the First British Air-
borne Division’s fight at Arn-
hem. The cast consists mainly
of men who fought there,
and most of the scenes wer® re-
created in the actual. village.
Well worth a visit.

“Unconquered” (Sydney
Prince Edward): Gary Cooper
and Paulette Goddard in a De
Mille special with Injuns, con-
victs, gun-runners, scalpers,
Indian wars and even the Black
Watch complete with bagpipes.
De Mille is as prodigal as ever
with action and spectacle, and
Howard da Silva as the bad egg
seems to have been hatched from
a long line of particularly odor-
ous henfruit.

“Temptation Harbor” (Sydney
Victory); Excellent psycho-
logical study by Robert New-
ton as a signalman who picks up
£50()0 after the actual thief has
murdered his accomplice. His
struggle with his conscience is
slowly but accurately played out
with admirable support from a
handful of minor characters.

With its inspiration apparently
from “Odd Man Out” and its
title from a juicy section of
“Macbeth,” “The Long Night,”
at Sydney Plaza, should have
had something to it, but apart
from 500 “maggies” fired by
police as Henry Fonda shouts
defiance from his attic window,
the film is dull. It might have
been improved with better act-
ing ; as it stands the best his-
trionic performance comes from
the stuffed teddy-bear o n
Fonda’s dressing-table.


Women’s letters
From Melbourne
As befits a popular pair who, since they
first came to Victoria, have given solid
support to every worthwhile cause, their
Excellencies jointly voice sincere and
moving concern;
Government House,
Melbourne.
We are both deeply distressed to learn that
the appeal for funds to provide a War Nurses’
Centre is not receiving the universal support it
deserves, and we feel compelled to ask our
generous citizens to rally to the rescue in aid
of this worthy cause.
Our nurses: have we forgotten their mag-
nificent services in war and peace, their devo-
tion and their sacrifices? Have we overlooked
the fact that 75 of them—a high percentage—
lost their lives while serving in face of the
enemy, and that many others, sonre still young,
are now suffering ill-health as a result of hard-
ship and exposure as prisoners-of-war? Their
names are legion; they hold a proud place on
the roll of honor of*Australia’s heroes.
What is our answer in gratitude and admira-
tion? Surely it must be some small recognition
of duty well and nobly done, of sacrifices, as
well as some encouragement to those who
follow after; those who are now taking up the
torch and who need all our help in their efforts
in the cause of humanity.
All that our nurses ask for —and it is little
enough—is a centre in which their services in
war and peace be honored by establishing an
institutidh where they may enjoy some measure
of rest and recreation in retirement and where
those now serving may have an opportunity to
devote themselves to the further study of their
profession.
This is the cause we plead for. It is the first
combined appeal we have made and perhaps
the last we shall make to the people of Victoria.

Sister Betty Lawson has been chosen
as the third Centaur scholarship winner.
Betty, who is on the administrative staff
of the Royal Melbourne Hospital as
supervising sister, is a triple-certificated
nurse and a graduate of the Royal Mel-
bourne Hospital. For two years Betty
served with the A.A.N.S., mostly on
hospital ships. Present plans, as an-
nounced by the Centaur Scholarship Com-
mittee, are that Betty will leave for Eng-
land in July.
China, linen and silver were among
the gifts brought to the shower tea-party
given by Mrs. Eric Rogers at Thurlstone,
St. Kilda-road, to Joan Denyer, who
marries Jack Morris, of Sydney, today at
Melbourne Grammar Chapel. The
hostess Wore a white frock patterned in
pink flowers and green leaves. The
guest-of-honor chose a white silk jersey
frock which featured a draped skirt; her
large white hat was bound with red,
black and white ribbon. Joan, who has
appeared in many Little Theatre produc-
tions, was happy to see among the guests
fellow-players Loveday Hills, wearing
mauve crepe spotted in white, and Muriel
Hearne, smart in a beige jacket suit.
Also in a pretty beige jacket suit was song-
stress Muriel Howard. Mrs. Geoff Wil-
son’s brown-and-white-spot frock was set
off by a large natural-straw hat trimmed
with lime-green flowers. Mrs. Denyer’s
frock of pastel-blue Was patterned in
grey. Mrs. W. Flintoft’s white crepe frock
was studded with royal-blue flpwers, her
paler-blue straw hat trimmed with multi-
toned satin ribbon.
Another party for a February bride,
Anne Dunstan, was given by Mrs. Isobel
Green. Venue of the party was the secre-
tary’s residence, Melbourne Aquarium.
Anne, who will marry Mts. Green’s son
Bob, at Mt. Eliza Church of England at
the end of the month, was in a frock of
French-blue crepe and small , flower-
trimmed hat. Mrs. Green’s large black
hat carried a sweeping pink ostrich-
feather round the brim. Mrs. Dunstan
wore a black jacket suit bound in dusty-
pink which matched the ribbon trimming
her black hat. Mrs. Eric Rummery-
Blackford, Anne’s sister, who will be
matron-of-honor at the wedding, wore
black lace over pink and a small stiffened
black-lace hat. Another sister, Mrs.
David Curtain, chose a grey frock and
contrasted it with a small cerise straw
hat. Mrs. Frank Fischer’s ballerina frock
was in pastel-blue. Mrs. Green’s
daughter, Mrs. Ron McGregor, wore with
her pale-lavender crepe frock a matching
hat trimmed with mauve petunias. Mrs.
Gordon Coulter’s all-black ensemble was
topped by an aqua-blue hat. Mrs. Eric
Harrison was also in black ; Alice Wyatt
wore a cyclamen-trimmed hat and gloves
with her black lace frock.
Tivoli first-nighters on a humid night
looked with enyy at the “Fine Feathers”
ballet clad only in a wisp of tulle and a
few sequins, and wielding large white
ostrich - feather fans. Among the
applauders of a show that was pleasantly
even in character, though lacking any out-
standing drawcard, were Mrs. Norman
Lynch, who tucked a blouse of hunter’s -
green crepe into a full-flared brown skirt
which had a wide gold belt; Lucille

The Victoria League’s party was a “hail
and farewell” one. “Good-byes” were
said to Archbishop Booth and Mrs.
Booth, the Bishop of Armidale, Dr. J. S.
Moyes, H. F. Gurney, U.K. Trade Com-
missioner, who with his wife also left
for England in the Orion, Miss Jean
Hamilton, who goes in the Stratheden with
her brother, Admiral Sir Louis Hamilton,
and Lady Crocker, who is also returning
to Englapd. Welcomes were given to Mr.
and Mrs. Basil Henriques, who are in
this city on a short visit. Miss M. E.
Chomley, chairman of the League, and
members of the committee acted as
hostesses. They included Mrs. H. N.
Faull, smart in black with a small black
hat trimmed with aqua-blue satin ribbon ;
Mrs. Bowen Allen, whose pastel-floral
frock was worn with a large white straw
hat with flowers set under the brim, and
Patricia Ker, whose aqua crepe frock
featured a peplum. Mrs. Guy Bakewell,
senior vice-president, and Mesdames
R. A. Staughton and Rupert Greene were
also busy in the throng caring for guests.
Recent engagement is that of Cynthia,
elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bruce
Williams, of Caulfield, to Brian Knowles,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. Reginald H.
Kempton, of Melbourne. Brian, who is
a pilot with the Royal Victorian Aero
Club, put his prowess as a swimmer to
good use when recently he was able to
give valuable assistance in a motor-launch
accident at Lakes Entrance.
Anne Turnbull, a Melbourne girl noted
for her smart dressing, is engaged and
will be married shortly. Anne, who is
the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Turnbull, of Toorak, is now in
England. Her fiance is Major Martin
Clemens, M.C., of the Colonial Admini-
strative Services, Palestine, son of Mrs.
Warren Clemens, of Aberdeen, and the
late Mr. Warren Clemens.
From Sydney
“House Full” laughed at the Royal
last Saturday with Cicely Courtneidge,
thousands went out to the Sports Arena
to watch Johnny Kohlenberg and Ern
Scotton in the push-bike sprints. These
included this Letter’s taxi-driver. He
lives in the memory because in these
days when everybody you know talks in
ballet French, he asked refreshingly:
“Are you going to the ballet?” stressing
the final consonant. Anyway that’s no
worse than wobbly French or Italian.
Why must one always murmur “pas de
trois” instead of boldly uttering “dance
for three” and suchlike? Maybe it adds
to the charm.
Saturday night’s opening ballet was
“Giselle.” And whether its being St.
Valentine’s Day had anything to do with
the matter, there wasn’t a woman in the
crowded-out Tivoli, no matter how suc-
cessful she was, either by marriage or by
graduation in the business world, whose
heart didn’t melt to the story of the gay,
the too-loving, the broken-hearted
heroine. Sally Gilmour with her dear
little Barrie heroine face is probably the
perfect Giselle. If ever she leaves the
world of ballet Sally could make a bril-
liant name as an actress.
The mingling of colors in this work
was an achievement. There was the
orange of the marigold, there was water-
melon-pink, there was a cloud-like grey,
and there was the cornflower-blue ol
Giselle’s own dress. That was all in the
first act, before all the village maidens
turned up again as they did in the second
act as spirits from the yawning grave.
Coldly white then were their frocks. But
the audience wore glittering array. There
were sequins and rhinestones glittering
on every second frock. There were sway-
ing linen evening frocks exotic in their
printed designs. Fur capes were worn,
the expensive furs that all the year round
seem able to snap their teeth at the moth
of bankruptcy.
Dancing teachers were upstairs and
downstairs, the Cay sisters among them.
Miss Doris Beattie and her friend
Miss Lawson were there, and all
the usual first-nighters, including Mrs.
A. E. Grace and a party. Also
there were the Ben Fullers and
daughter Pat. In the same row of the
stalls were knight Benjamin and his lady.
The Robert Noss couple, Mr. and-Mrs.
Russell Catts, the Pierre Manns and
Margaret Gillespie were among the
applauders.
This is a Clarice Boyce study of Sydney
pianist Enith Clarke, who commences
an Australia-wide tour with the A-B.C. on
February 21 playing with the Queensland
Symphony Orchestra conducted by John
Farnsworth Hall. On April 19 she plays
with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
conducted by Eugene Goossens. Enith
leaves Australia in the Stratheden in
June, at the conclusion of her A.B.C.
season. Her objective in going overseas
is to study her art still further in Paris.
Here Luzare-Levy, who taught Solomon,
will be her first teacher ; later she will
have lessons from Alfred Cortot. Enith is
the wife of brilliant pianist Alexander
Sverjensky, with whom she studied when
she came to Sydney from Rockhampton
some years ago.
Commander David Kinloch is about
7ft. tall, so it’s a good job his parents
didn’t apprentice him to a submarine. At
least when he got topside on his
destroyers he was able to uncoil to full
length. The Commander, who scoured
the seas during the years 1939-45 and
has long and glowing citations for brave
deeds in the Mediterranean, the Arctic
and the Atlantic, came to Australia in
the Stratheden. He will, for the next
few weeks, shuttle back and forth be-
tween the North and South Islands of
Maoriland and Sydney, busy on the work
of developing the Overseas League.
On Thursday and Friday sherry was
poured at the Overseas Club in the Com-
mander’s honor. On Thursday the
Council hurried along with smiles and
handshakes. President Keith Smith broke j
into the usual “few words,” but David .
wasn’t to be lured. He had a speech j
prepared for Friday’s “do” when all the
members would be gathered around, and
until then he was just another unit of
the Silent Service —well, 40 per cent,
silent. Sydney secretary Kath Gaden re-
ceived the guests, and her frock of
celadon-blue crepe sprayed with frangi-
pani is herewith mentioned in dis-
patches. Beulah Bolton, from the Vic-
toria League, Dr. Wheatley, from the
Royal Empire Society, and the wife of
United Kingdom’s Ambassador Williams
offered greetings.
The Australian Book Society is holding

For the 1948 Royal Easter Show, start-
ing on March 20 and ending on March
31, the R.A.S. has stepped into line with
modern thought and is turning its old-
time needlework and cookery section into
a “Home and Handcrafts” one. To en-
courage the exhibition of work by dis-
abled servicemen and civilians it is open
to both men and women. The needle-
work and crafts classes carry prizemoney
of £1 first and 10s. second place. In
addition there’s a championship prize of
three guineas for the best piece of needle-
work and for the best handknitted article
two guineas. There are prizes for
cookery, jams and preserves of all kinds
and cakes and biscuits, A wedding-cake
of two tiers, iced and decorated, may even
collect £l9. Schedules are now avail-
able from the R.A.S., 33 Macquarie-place,
Sydney.
Slim and trig ballerinas in cool silks,
or the sombreness of black, the sombre-
ness flashing to bright little hats gay with
flowers, bloomed in the ballroom of the
Australia on an afternoon last week. The
British Council gave a five-to-six-o’clock
party in honor of Madame Rambert and
her company, and the guest list seemed
to include every well-known balletomane
in the city, so that the whole was like
some gathering of the clans. Mr. G.
Thomas, who represents the Council, and
Madame Rambert received the guests.
Madame, small and exquisite in blue,
suggested a Wedgwood figurine.
Sally Gilmour was interesting to talk
to. She has met David Garnett, the
author of “Lady Into Fox” and “Sailor’s
Return,” of which Sally has made such
triumphant ballet. She says David
Garnett is rather like Aldous Huxley.
Another magnet was Spanish dancer Sara
Lusita, who had all the grace of old
Castile in her movement and smile. Her
frock was full-skirted, buoyant; her tiny
curvette had three red roses above each
ear, and it had black velvet streamers.
John Gilpin, enjoying his eighteenth birth-
day, was congratulated by all. Pamela
Vincent, Annette Chappell and Barbara
Grimes were three other ballerinas, slim
and bright. But the party, as far as the
dancers were concerned, was a mere
glancing at the food and a sip or two
of fruit-cup. Ladies and gentlemen of
the ballet are very self-denying.
And then there was Tommy Cochrane.
In fact, this was quite a Tom and Jerry
brew, for Bannister, the much-
quoted, was another notable. Among the
sleekly-groomed women sipping the fruit-
cup or ginny drinks were Mrs. Charles
Lloyd Jones, lovely black frock and
diamond clips ; Mrs. Eugene Goossens,
her soft ice-blue silks served with costume
jewellery; Mrs. Reg. Bettington, frock'
a deep turquoise, her hat upswept
of brim; Mrs. Bertie Kelly, her black
frock gracefully draped. Margaret Gil-
lespie was there, and Mrs. Ben Edye and
daughter Benom. The Hope Gibsons,
Harald Bowden, the Ben Fullers,
cartoonist Jimmy Bancks and Mrs.
Walter Burfitt and everybody.
The Minister for Belgium, Paul Ver-
straeten, had his dinner-party in honor of
Sydney University’s Vice - Chancellor
Roberts and Mrs. Roberts just one lap ;
ahead of Ash Wednesday. It was very |
sumptuous and gay. The guests were bid- I
den for half-past seven, and it was not till i
11 o’clock that cars started to purr home- i
wards. There were 40 guests, a great
percentage Consular. There were also
the State’s Chief Justice Jordan and Lady
Jordan, the Charles Lloyd Joneses and
many academic importants. The dinner
was in one of the private rooms of
Gleneagles, and on the gleaming white
napery of the long table were scattered
carnations and cornflowers. Roses, too,
came into the flower decorations. Dessert
was a super ice served from melons, the
tops of which had been perforated and
lifted off.
This evening at a quarter to six the
Lady Mayoress, Mrs. R. J. Bartley, will
declare the Red Cross V.A.D. Club open.
The club is in Red Cross House, 27
Jamieson-street, and V.As. are very en-
thusiastic about the new venture.

THE SERVICE MAN
PRELUDE TO SINGAPORE.
Some More History.
“Ek Dum”: In the week of
the anniversary of the fall of
Singapore a little history is not
out of place.
On October 24, 1941, two
days after Admiral Nomura,
Japanese special envoy, had
asked to be brought home
from Washington, where he
was leading “a hypocritical
existence” persuading the Ameri-
cans that Japan was peacefully
inclined, the Russian Ambassa-
dor asked for a* stern warning
to be issued by the British and
United States Governments
against aggression by Japan.
The Australian Cabinet, Com.
outcries notwithstanding, had
great hopes from Japanese
“moderation,” and no considera-
tion seems to have been given by
the Canberra “Government” as
to where means of fighting Japan
were to come from. It hadn't a
properly-armed brigade in Aus-
tralia or enough aircraft to fight
a modernly-equipped squadron
of enemy machines. Its Navy at
home was negligible. Its divi-
sions overseas had to depend on
tfie hard-pressed British and
Canadian industry for arms and
ammunition. •
While the Royal Navy was
ready at this period to establish
a base in Australia, there was
no graving-dock, Messrs. Curtin,
Beasley, Holloway and others
having bitterly opposed the
building of one even after war
had begun, though afterwards
they smirked unashamedly for
having completed what the
Menzies Government had begun
in opposition to their scorn.
Japan Moves South
There were known, on
November 29, to be up to
70,000 Japanese troops in Indo-
China and more on the water.
There was every indication from
the gathering concentration of
Jap shipping and its location
that the Japs contemplated
attack on Thailand and the
seizure of the Kra Isthmus, the
narrow neck which connects the
Malay Peninsula to Asia and the
land bridge through which
enemy troops could come down
from Thailand.
But Canberra was quite
happy. About that day it
allowed the C.-in-C. in the
Middle East, its most valued ad-
viser, General Blarney, to fly
back to Cairo. It saw nothing
unusual in the fact that while
the preparations were being
made for air patrols over
Japanese-held waters by the
British and American com-
mands at Singapore and Manila,
the G.O.C. of the two-thirds of
an A.I.F. division in Malaya
(which the Cabinet appeared to
regard as about the equivalent
of a couple of army corps) was
away visiting the Libyan front
5000 miles to the west and, as
was later shown by his diary,
completely out of touch with
the local situation.
Canberra felt no fright suffi-
cient to justify the evacuation of
civilians from Rabaul or pre-
parations to take effective war
measures in New Guinea despite
the report from the D.E.I. that
Japanese concentrations were
gathering at Palau and therefore
threatening the southern Philip-
pines and the Dutch East Indies,
This was more astonishing since
Ministers professed to believe
that attack might be “imminent.”
Cabinet was convinced in any
case that Japan would not be
likely to do anything so un-
gentlemanly as to make a* move
until after the Kurusu-Hull
talks had finished in Washing- 1
ton. Indeed, its viewpoint ap-
pears to have been that when
the crisis came it would take the
form of a well-defined move by
Japan followed by a declaration
of war by the United States. It
was prepared to await the event,
not declaring war until the
United States gave a positive
assurance of armed action, while
continuing to stand by China
by all means short of a declara-
tion of war.
After Pearl Harbor’s disaster
it was obvious from the first that
the situation was serious. It was
also certain that the effort which
the British were making was
little short of herculean, though
anti - British propaganda was
rife in “Labor” and Communist
circles. The censorship, so
far as Britain was concerned,
was wide open in Australia,
except in relation to what she
was actually doing—facts which
security dictated should remain
hidden. Every Communist was
allowed to say exactly what he
pleased about the inefficiency of
British command, the necessity
to import a few Russians to
teach them how to fight and
their cowardice or treachery in
allowing 4,000,000 fat soldiers to
eat their heads off in Britain
“We can take two more! ”
when they could be in Berlin if
they showed a little Communist
courage.
Naval Defence Begins
Two British battleships were
in the Indian Ocean 10 days
after the Pacific war broke out.
The route to Suez was kept safe
so that Australian divisions
could be brought home. A
stream of aircraft was being
diverted from the Middle East.
And help was being sent from
Britain, 11,000 miles to Singa-
pore, even though it was still
problematical whether or no a
desperate effort might have to
be made at any moment to stem
a rusn -ot German divisions
through the Caucasus into
Persia or to make §ome wild
sally to take a little pressure off
nearly-beaten Russia in Europe.
U.S. naval help which had been
expected had been temporarily
wiped out by the Pearl Harbor
disaster. Heavy-bomber squad-
rons which might have aided
Singapore had been destroyed
in the Philippines when they had
been left out in the open.
It was obvious that it would
take four months to send any
competent rescue force from
Europe to Singapore, but logis-
tics was an unknown science to
the Australian Cabinet, and it
constantly cried out for the dis-
patch at once of divisions, battle-
ships, anything.
Plans were made in London
early in December to send the
battleships Queen Elizabeth and
Valiant from the Mediter-
ranean. Warspite was com-
ing from the U.S. Anson,
a new Prince of Wales class
ship, was to be thrown in as
soon as finished. Four of the
Revenge class were to be avail-
able, along with Nelson and
Rodney, the two 16-inch ships,
50 soon as they could be spared.
All this within a few days of
the sinking of Prince of Wales
and Repulse. These ships were
not to be concentrated without
aircraft cover. The great
carriers Indomitable, , Formid-
able, Illustrious and Hermes
wep to provide their umbrella.
Operations were necessarily
hampered by the absence of a
graving-dock and base outside
Singapore. There was no base
outside Singapore, then menaced
by four - Japanese divisions with
150 tanks in the north, from
which Australian sea lines of
. communication could be de-
fended, but it was emphasised
that Britain would stand by her
undertakings and cover the sea-
lines (besides providing carry-
ing-ships) as need arose. That
promise was kept loyally. The
defence of the Indian Ocean was
built up with almost incredible
speed. It is difficult to believe
that the same supposedly beaten
and effete old country which
was being execrated and jeered
at in January and February,
1942, stopped the Japanese west-
ward drive in the Bay of Bengal
in March before the Americans
had enough troops and naval
might. General Eisenhower
afterwards described it as the
turning-point of the world war.
It is almost equally unbeliev-
able, but true, that the Australian
Government opposed the British
plans to defend the Indian
O^pean.
Meanwhile Canberra had not
lost its voice. The “Govern-
ment” demanded bold measures
in Singapore—Mr. Curtin told
the writer some time afterwards
that he had told the British de-
cisively that help must not be
sent in “penny packets.” It de-
manded that the weak air
strength should be made up at
once. When Britain diverted the
first available brigade of the
17th Indian Division to Malaya
to still the complaints—it was
badly needed for Burma —Can-
berra protested that it was en-
tirely insufficient and demanded
to know why the whole division
had not been sent at once.
Apart from the fact that the
division was sent to placate Mr.
Curtin’s wrath and only because
it was thought certain that one
of the Australian divisions in
the Middle East might fill the
gap left in India, the Curtin Gov-
ernment obviously had no con-
ception of the shipping needed
to carry a division and its equip-
ment in one piece. It was a gal-
lant and risky adventure to send
one brigade through Sunda on a
single ship.
Messrs. Curtin, Evatt and
their associates, there being
three A.I.F. divisions in the
Middle East, were not prepared
to tolerate conditions under
which two brigades of A.I.F.
were left in Malaya by the British
without air cover. No word, pre-
sumably, was said in cables to
the British Government about
the fact that only three months,
before at least one Labor
Minister (then a member of the
Australian Advisory War Coun-
cil) was abetting a strike in fac-
tories concerned with the manu-
facture of aircraft parts, which
had been promoted to secure the
release from internment of a
couple of Communist saboteurs.
The British Government was re-
minded bitterly of its failures in
Greece and Crete and told very
plainly that Mr. Curtin and his
colleagues would have no more
of that sort of thing.
Mr. Churchill’s Reply
Since, at that time, a state of
mind existed at Canberra which
impelled Ministers to display
their wounds to anybody who
would listen, it was not diffi-
cult to discover that Mr.
Churchill had met Australian re-
proaches with a hot telegram
in which the greatest reproof
lay in a reminder that for years
Britain had been enforcing uni-
versal compulsory service not
only for men but for women.
Canberra’s publicists then
turned their criticism towards
the Indians, and wailed that
they were bitterly disturbed
to hear that these soldiers were
not suited to the Malayan type
of warfare.
Rabaul Falls
It was at this stage that the
Government really began to
show what it could do.
While it had been instructing
the world in the running of
wars and on the iniquity of a
country 11,000 miles from the
battlefield, and itself locked in
combat on three or four fronts,
in failing to • provide air cover
for Dominion troops in Malaya,
1700 inexperienced Australian
militia and a large number of
Civilians were left out on a limb
at Rabaul to perish in Japanese
hands. They, too, had no air
cover, no artillery, no anything.
This setback did not cramp
the Curtin Government’s style.
It sternly determined to hold
• Moresby, which, it believed,
since Rabaul was lost, to
be the only base in the
Pacific from which the British
and Americans could attack the
Marshalls and Carolines. It
proposed to' stave off the Jap
from Moresby with 5500 men!
Not Available
On the day Rabaul fell the
responsibility for the defence of
North Australia above the line
from Derby (W.A.) to the Gulf
of Carpentaria was delegated to
Field-Marshal Lord Wavell.
Temporarily he was thus
covering the main channel of
possible invasion of Australia,
and it might have been expected
that the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment would offer him the laSt
man and the last ounce of
material to keep the enemy off
Australian soil, more especially
as it had been demanding con-
scripts from England to fight for
Malaya and was on the point of
making a modest call on Messrs.
Churchill and Roosevelt for 25
divisions (plus a requisite
2,000,000 tons of transport
shipping and all armament and
supplies) to defend the Com-
monwealth.
It, however, made it clear to
F.-M. Wavell that its military
forces in the north totalled only
14.000 and that the only part of
these which could leave the Aus-
tralian coast to fight in the
Indies and fend off attack were
a pioneer battalion, a field regi-
ment, and some small units of
A.1.F., all the rest being militia
who were rooted to Australian
soil. The Government which
proclaimed this position was the
same which! a few weeks before
had laid great stress on the fact
that Portuguese Timor was a
vital gateway to Australia which
must be held at any cost.
The Lesson of Singapore
Singapore fell a few days
after these incidents. It would
not have fallen had there been
an adequate force with naval
and air cover to hold it for
another six weeks. By that time
the British-Indian plans called
for the insertion of about
140.000 men into the island. The
military force needed would
have been within the compass
of Australia’s ability when war
actually broke out in Decem-
ber had she had an effective
compulsory-training system in
vogue before World War II
began and a commensurate
organisation for arming it.
Not having these, largely
through the strenuous opposi-
tion of the political Labor
party, the pillage and ruin of
the whole country was invited.
This did not prevent Mr.
Eddie Ward, on the day after
Rabaul fell, remarking savagely
that he would like toi criminally
prosecute those members of the
Liberal-Country party Opposi-
tion who had failed to provide
adequate defence for the Com-
monwealth !
The whole incident should
provide a salutary lesson. We
may not have the same luck next
time.
Socialist Surrender.
“Ek Dum”: The world situa-
tion continues to deteriorate,
and matters seem to have gone
so far that even Mr. Attlee ap-
pears to realise it:
The fight between totalitarianism
and democracy is 0n... .Communism
has turned its back on civilisation.
The Russians have reverted to
Czarism.
One can only hope that if it
comes to blows Mr. Attlee will
not be in charge to do the fight-
ing. His record so far has been
a long series of capitulations'. He
has completely abrogated his
rights in the Pacific to anybody
who cares to take charge.
Burma has been handed over to
people who are no better than
Communists. Malaya has virtu-
ally been handed back to the
sultans. The British forces, or
nearly all of them, have been
withdrawn from Japan. The
Royal Navy, guardian of all
trade-routes, is in a process of
retrenchment and retirement.
The United States Navy has
taken over the defence of trade
routes, and for the first time in
peace-time history has a U.S.
battleship fleet patrolled the
English Channel.
And, judging by the past
week’s happenings, any small or
cheeky nation which cares to
kick, cuff or threaten the British
Empire is at liberty to go ahead.
Argentina is reported to be
sending a naval squadron to
take possession of the Falkland
Islands, and Westminster’s
“reply” is to offer to refer the
claims of Argentina to an inter-
national Court.
This is a staggering situation
The Falklands were ceded to
Britain. by Spain by convention
in 1771, 45 years before Argen-
tina existed as an independent
country.
The islands are a vital stra-
tegic defence platform defending
the Cape Horn route, and there-
fore are of great importance to
Australia,
That was proved on December
8, 1914, when Admiral Sir
Doveton Sturdee caught the
German Pacific Fleet there—
Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Leipzig,
Niirnberg and Dresden —and,
issuing from Port William, sank
the lot except Dresden.
That decisive victory, ending
German cruiser warfare and giv-
ing Britain “undisputed control
of the ocean trade-routes of the
world,” would not have been
possible without possession ot
the Falklands.
Lieutenant General Gordon
Bennett laid a wreath on the
Sydney Cenotaph on February
15 to commemorate the anni-
versary of the fall of Singapore,
but otherwise that sad event was
little remembered in Australia.

Peering into a tyre's future: This uncanny
machine, invented by Goodyear, tests tyres before
they are built! Those bits of rubber hose are made
of the same materials that may be used in the
manufacture of Goodyear tyres. The machine
blows air into these tubes and at the same time
bends and revolves them rapidly. This duplicates
the twisting, stretching strain a tyre gets in ser-
vice. Road speeds of 100 miles, an hour can be
simulated.
Samples that show up best in this test are given
many other tests. The best are then made into
tyres and tested for millions of miles on the rhad.
Goodyear testing has kept Good-

T?rthr>vt rtf ChptfPV brought the science of chemistry
JXOaeri OJ newer to Western Europe. 800 years
ago. Of this remarkable man’s origin little is known except that
he was probably born in Rutland. He was certainly educated
at the then flourishing school at Chester, after which, following
the custom of the times, he studied at the Moorish universities
in Spain. The Moors or Arabs were the world’s leading
scientists at that period. On 11th February. 1144, Robert com-
pleted the translation into Latin of an Arabic treatise on
chemistry. This was Europe’s first chemical text-book.
No doubt he also brought with him from Spain one of the
flowing Arab robes which, as the "gown” of British universities,
still serves to remind us that a close bond once linked the
scholars of East and West. He could no more have dreamed
of the place this garment was to occupy in later years than he
could have imagined the future of another Arabic treatise he
translated. This was a work by a celebrated mathematician.
Khwarizine, on a branch of mathematics developed by the
Arabs and still known to its Arabic name, algebra
Besides his extensive works in' mathematics,
Robert made the first Latin translation of the
Koran. Europe owes an immeasurable debt to
this Englishman. But for him. the knowledge
of the East of chemistry and mathematics might
have remained a closed book to the Western
world for centuries afterwards.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The success of old Tahmoor, Syd-
ney’s lone representative in Saturday’s
Oakleigh Plate at Caulfield, was a
reward for shrewd “setting” of a
horse for the one race he might have
it in him to win. Practically every
race-day provides examples suggest-
ing that that had become a lost art.
Once a topnotch sprinter, capable
of beating the best of them at six
or seven furlongs, Tahmoor over the
last couple of years had been running
fairly consistently up near the place-
getters in such events. Despite com-
ing down to the level of the mere
moderates in the weights, he still
failed to ever look like winning.
Lesser lights would regularly go past
him in the last furlong. He seemed
to have had his day.
Apparently the Oakleigh Plate’s
singular distance of 5) furlongs was
just what the old fellow now re-
quired : certainly he’d have been
beaten in another half-furlong. But
no amount of shrewd placing, nor
anything else, is any good without
luck. Tahmoor had to have his share
of it, or at any rate some of the
others had to do without their share.
Contrary to some reports, Tahmoor
had not been notoriously awkward in
heavy going, and, though his rider,
McGrowdie, said he slipped about a
bit, his feather weight of 7.10 still
gave him a big advantage over the
weight-carriers. Their weight on the
heavy track was too much for Assam
(9.1) and Comedy Prince (8.11) par-
ticularly. Both showed good New-
market form in finishing close to the
place-getters.
Comedy Prince’s weight was a big
burden for a three-year-old; he is
an exceptionally good one. So is the
other South Australian contender,
Galway Pipe (second, after his con-
nections’ protest had been dismissed).
Prince Curl (third) had bad luck in
the running. Denhoti (fifth) is likely
to trouble any of them on a firm
track.
Tahmoor —an eight-year-old gelding
by Royal Sun—started at 25 to 1
and probably brought the books their
greatest harvest, since the majority of
racegoers can’t resist punting on big
events, though these are usually the
very hardest to pick. But the other
winners as well, with only one excep-
tion, helped to make a harvest festival
for the books. The one favorite to
get home was the two-year-old Ben-
gal, very narrowly defeating Anomaly,
with Poona third, in a division of
the five-furlongs Federal Stakes.
In the other Federal divisions,
Dawson downed the joint hot favorite
Comic Court, with Blitzmark next and
the other joint favorite, Gay Saint,
nowhere, and the 200-to-l chance
Melorna beat Queen’s Court and
Sarah Belle, with heavily-backed
Blessing, Chosen and Novam among
the also-rans. Both Dawson and
Melorna are by that fine sire St.
Magnus.
Though backed, Chatsol was only
third favorite in the 12-furlongs Bond
Handicap, in which he raced right
away from Orthodox and Sir Toba.
Even less fancied, Valcurl accounted
for Fresh Boy, Chanak and others
in the nine-furlongs St. George
Stakes (w.f.a.), and outsider Merry
Edition completed the dismal day for
punters in winning the mile Welter
from Constable and El Banco. The
track was evidently not to Chanak’s
liking. Fresh Boy, who ran such
sterling races for his age in the two
big Cups last year, looks like doing
better still this time.

The field for the Flying at Canter-
bury provided the unusual spectacle
of its being led out by a Melbourne
Cup winner, Hiraji; but, unless the
grey has thickened up out of all
reckoning, he represented a good ad-
vertisement for the stable’s oats. Like
most of the field —it included Murray
Stream, Black Pearl, Tamaroa and
Paktong—he looked as if he should
be nicely fit in about a month’s time.
His Cup win has , done the grey no
harm; with 8.9 he seems all the more
the goods for the Sydney Cup. For
all his brewery-horse roundness, he
galloped strongly and finished well
in fourth place, behind Glencrag (V.
Faggotter), Rose Glory and Star Vite.
Rose Glory, for pigrooting at the
barrier, was sent to the outside; it
cost her the race.
Only eight contested the main
event, the 11-furlongs Frank Under-
wood Cup (named after its donor).
It was well won by Cape Neddick
(R. Kerrigan) from Euryalus and
Laudus. The donor himself pre-
sented the Cup; a pleasant little
interlude. There could be more such
gestures against the hard commer-
cialism of Sydney racing.
Favorites Bold Duke (G. Moore)
and Cragside (J. Thompson) won the
five-furlongs events for two-year-olds.
Each carried top weight and looked
as if he should have won easier than
he did, so they’re better-than-average
colts. Their respective runners-up,
the lightly-weighted fillies Autumn
Glory and Byron Lass, both ran
promising races.
In divisions of a six-furlongs Mixed
Stakes the prolific country winner
Blue Tulip (W. Cook) defeated Tom-
boy and Critique (she was lucky to
beat either of them, especially
Critique, the day’s most unlucky run-
ner), and Romany King (F. Williams)
just nutted Penmore, with the grey
Denali next. A shade further distance
should suit Denali, but that goes
also for Romany King, who finished
really well. A Mixed over nine fur-
longs was won by Lord Desmond (G.
Moore) from Merry John and Prince
Verity, and a Welter over the same
distance by Herbert River (N. Sell-
wood) from Thrums and Frontal
Attack. Thrums, a hot favorite, looks
an early winner. Frontal Attack did
by far his best run this time up, and
now looks very fit.
Newcastle jockey A. McHue was
the unluckiest rider of the day—and
the luckiest. Well up in the big
“Are y' ready, ref.? Well, start countin' !"
Victorian W. Johnston headed the
Australian bowling for the Tests, with
16 wickets averaging 11.37; Queens-
lander L. Johnson next, then Toshack,
I. Johnson and Lindwall. Amamath
topped- the Indian attack, bagging 13
wickets, averaging 28.1, in 127 overs.
The much-overworked Mankad bowled
170 overs for the next-best bag of
wickets —l2 though his average
wasn’t so good as Phadkar’s and
Rangachari’s. If there’d been no
Bradman results could have been
very different. Bradman actually
aggregated more than the three next
to him in the averages (Hassett,
aggregate 331; Harvey, 166 ; Morris,
209), whereas the first Indian three
were Phadkar, 314; Hazare, 419;
Mankad, 306.
It was part of the picture of the
Indian visit that at the finish
Amarnath, interviewed by old
cricketer Arthur Mailey, said of the
opposing skipper: “Don Bradman is
a great player, the best cricketer in
the world, and a gentleman and a
field of the nine-furlongs Mixed
Stakes, all crowding for position
making the first turn out of the
straight, his mount, Werriston King,
came down and everything seemed
to go over the top of him. Sellwood
said afterwards that his mount, The
Gaffer, actually jumped over McHue,
who lay moveless after they’d all
passed. Yet McHue got out of it
with a broken shoulder and some
minor damage.

Shannon’s third defeat in America
was his worst —there or here. He
finished only eighth at a distance that
should have suited him (nine fur-
longs), his reputation resting largely
on his Australian record time for a
mile. Perhaps he needs more time
to become acclimatised. On the other
hand, Sydney form when he was at
his top wasn’t anything wonderful.

Perhaps the Indian tourers, when it
came to their follow-on innings in
the final Test, were feeling the strains
of the tour, the luck of the toss and
the like so persistently against them,
and the hopelessness of their positiop
in this particular match ; and maybe
happenings at home, which they must
have been feeling keenly, had their
effect. At any rate, they collapsed:
Mankad, who had scored another of
his fine centuries against the odds in
the first innings, going for a “duck”;
the total 67; Australia by an innings
and 117 runs.
The last match was a forlorn affair
from when Bradman won the toss.
The Indians hadn’t been able to
bring their best side, and the oppo-
sition was simply too hot. But mostly
the visitors played a bright brand of
cricket, which will be remembered for
when they come again. •
Bradman, of course,- was miles
ahead of everyone in runs and aver-
age: a total of 715, av. 178.75, for
6 Test innings. The Melbourne match
was Bradman’s last in big cricket in
Australia; he will lead on the Eng-
lish tour and then turn the game in
—and how they’ll miss him! Cricket
has never had a more potent magnet
nor a greater master of the game.
sportsman. We felt it an honor to
play against him.”
Next to the hopeless wish of want-
ing to see the Indians win a Test,
Australian sporting instinct hoped
Westralia, at its first bid, would win
the Sheffield Shield. It looked just
as unlikely as the other hope, but
it came off, clinched by the outright
win over Queensland —W.A., 446 and
192; Q., 325 and 130. Thanks were
very much due to C. Puckett. Bowl-
ing for close on 2| hours, he took
1 for 39 in the first 17 overs, and
then, in the next 6 overs, three of
them maidens, bagged 5 for 9.
The 17 for England: Bradman,
Barnes, Brown, Harvey, Hamence,
Hassett, W. Johnston, lan Johnson,
Lindwall, Loxton, Arthur Morris,
Miller, McCool, Ring, Saggers,
Toshack, Tallon. The bulk of them
“picked themselves”; hence, as good
a lot as could have been selected;
the comparative dark horses, Ring
and Loxton, being about the equals
of borderliners to whom they were
preferred. MoCool has had the worst
season of the 17, but he could come
good in England. So could Brown,
who hadn’t been doing so well, either,
till he hit up a score in the final Test.
These and Hamence might be rated
lucky; omitted Dooland most un-
lucky.
With borderliners entering into it,
a Westralian might well have been
chosen. Winning the Shield will do
cricket a great deal of good in W.A.,
which will help Australian cricket
altogether. Taking one from the win-
ning State to England would have
done still more in that respect, as
well as widening interest in the tour.
There’s a lot to be learnt about the
value of such gestures.

As with all wars, conflicting
accounts have come out concerning
the Battle of the Eighteenth Hole, in
which, according to one apparently
impartial report, Australian golfer
Norman von Nida and American ditto
Henry Ransom came to blows oyer
the momentous issue of a ball having
been tapped, and “were rolling
around on the ground before police
broke them up.” Apart from its
happening a hole earlier than usual,
and the “rolling around” possibly
demonstrating that the belligerents
may know more about golf than
about stoush, there’s nothing very
surprising about it. It’s merely an-
other step forward for “sport” on
the low road of “temperament.”

Victorian swimmer John Mar-
shall won the Australian 440 freestyle
championship at the North Sydney
pool in the best time ever done by
an Australian —4min. 52.25ec. Wes-
tralian Garrick Agnew gave him a
great race fm it, but Marshall’s
stamina prevailed in the severe last
lap. The Olympic selectors naturally
rated Marshall No. 1 in their 11
nominations from which the rep. team
will be chosen.

For their Melbourne Stadium en-
counter Patrick (9.5| to Tollis’s 9.9)
was short of a gallop. He won in
the early stages, and did well enough
later to have been given the fight,
which ref. Jennings called a draw.
On the other hand, Patrick seldom
hit hard enough to really hurt Tollis,
who would gain most from the ex-
perience and will come out much
more confident next time,
Victorian flyweight champion Mickey
Fay (7.9) couldn’t get going in his
Leichhardt scrap with Jimmy Hogg
(7.12-i), and the N.S.W. Bst. title-
holder got there very easily on points.
Fay looked in poor nick ; only sheer
gameness kept him plugging.


ABORIGINALITIES
“B. A. Ker”: The Dortons were an
easygoing lot to work for, and Ab was
a good old toiler; I was surprised when
he told me he’d got another job. “I had
to clear out now or leave ’em when they’re
in trouble —and they’re too decent to do
that to,” he explained. “That back-
door pony of theirs. He always did
wriggle sliprails down and chew knots
undone, but when he started to pull back
the bar in wooden gates and nose up the
latch of the big Cyclone, I told ’em that
he was going to be more trouble than
he was worth. But they seemed to think
it was a big joke—and a bigger joke
when he shoved his head through the
kitchen window and snatched a piece of
bread and cocky’s joy out of me ’and.
They nearly busted ’emselves the Sunday
afternoon I was havin’ a snore-off
on the side verandah and woke up with
that dappled nuisance lickin’ the sweat
off me forehead. Even when he walked
into the kitchen and put his head in the
sponge mixture they reckoned he was
clever. One morning I saw him walk
across the rotten decking over the well.
I warned old Jack, but he grinned and
said ‘He’s too shrewd to get caught—if he
walks over it you can bet your life it’s
safe,’ Well, I figured out that the next
time that prad is shod the extra weight
will do the trick. So I pulled out. You
can’t walk out on a man when he’s got
a dead horse in his well, but I once
had to drink water that a horse had been
drowned in—never again,”
“Bo”: By the new-style “bushman”
who takes lessons in crooning, gets
around in sartor,ial imitation of Gene
Autry and could get bushed in a 10-acre
paddock such a pastime would probably
be disdainfully regarded as crude, even
un-Australian, but there was something
to be said for the quartpot-boiling com-
petitions that once enlivened many a
bush picnic. Not until the “gun” could
competitors dive for the makings for the
fire; the concentration of it for quick-
burning was an art, and especially so
when the wood was a bit damp. Con-
dition of the quartpot was all-important
—even its shape might mean the few
seconds between defeat and victory. And
the closeness of a finish as the first
bubbles crept up the sides would evoke
enthusiasm that the punters of Flem-
ington and Randwick could never im-
prove on. Thinking it over, perhaps it
is best that the sport passed out with the
old-timers. Consider the restless tossing
in their hoop T pine topcoats were their
spirits to hear some “quartpot-race com-
pere” working himself into a frantic
crescendo as he described the proceedings
over the air!

“Eastern”: Pulled up the nag on my
way to work to watch a big wedgetail
collect his morning feed. Flying past the
end of the paddock where cover was
plentiful, he selected the slopes that were
"You’ll have to hack it out with your niblick , mister."
dug out, and presently spotted his break-
fast. As he circled, his shadow passed
over the rabbit, and it started to run. The
eagle came lower, and realising his
number was up, began to squeal. He
streaked madly up the gully, stopped, and
changed direction. He might just as well
have waited and arched his back for the
pick-up. His squeals ended suddenly as
the eagle made off to tear him to bits on
a log. It is when he pulls on bigger
game, and has to dispense with the mercy
of killing it first, that the wedgie’s cruelty
is apparent. With small game, he kills
quickly. Disturbed one just as he made
his catch once, and he dropped his
rabbit. Its ribs were broken, and the
body pierced clean through in a couple
of places by the sharp talons.
« * * *
“Dronestung”: Watched a large red
bull-ant pause and peer inquisitively in the
entrance of a beehive just as one of the
hive guards stamped imperiously on to
the landing-board. The bee’s reactions
were much the same as when the head
of the house finds a yard or two of snake
draped on the front verandah. A yell
inside for volunteers, and bee locked
jaws with ant; then both were immedi-
ately balled in a rush of 20 or* 30 bees.
The excited knot pushed and shoved for
10 minutes or so. When I returned half
an hour later a bee and a bull-ant twitched
side by side on the ground in front of
the landing-board, and a sister bull-ant
was on the scene flexing muscles pre-
paratory to dragging the bee to the family
pantry.
“Aperist”: “Flathead’s” little fantasy
of the .way that assassin of the beehive
the Miller moth gains entrance (B.
14/1/’4B) cuts across some real facts.
One is that the Miller is a night-flier and
-prowler; and, since the bees, being sun-
shine-lovers, go to rest during the night;,
the moth has no difficulty in gaining
entrance through the slackly-guarded
doorway of the hive. Whether it stays
there depends next day on the strength
of the hive, on the number of police the
hive council is able to detach for the
patrolling of the dark corners of the
combs. Have often seen moths and their
larvae dragged out, stung repeatedly and
then picked up and dumped quite a dis-
tance away.

“E.K.”: “Chick” is out in his state-
ment (B. 28/1 / ’4B) that “abnormal thirst
is Nature’s way of asking for something
to be done about the internal shortage of
saline.” Actually, it is almost the dead
opposite, as it is an indication that the
amount of salt in the body is too great
in proportion to the amount of water,
and that Nature wants the mixture
diluted. This is the reason why ship-
wrecked sailors who drink sea water
only become thirstier, the saline proper-
ties raising again the body’s already high
ratio of salt to water.

“E. 2”; The apple-trees on Gran’pa
Marker’s were old and overgrown, but
they bore large crops of fine apples, in-
cluding luscious varieties not commonly
found in these days of cultivating stand-
ard kinds. Gran’pa, who lived frugally,
shared the fruit with the birds and school-
kids. Came a new family of uppish
neighbors who wanted a case of apples
“We won’t have them unless you allow
us to pay for them,” the woman an-
nounced firmly. Gran’pa bent on her a
withering look and ground his solitary
tooth. “Y’ couldn’t have ’em by payin’
f’r ’em ” he said. “If I started sellin’
’em there’d be no end to it. I d finish
up gittin’ too mean t’ be handin’ ’em

prunin’'an’ runnin’ down codlin-moths
half me time. Then I’d be losin’ money
on the proposition, or makin’ some an’
havin’ t’ pay tax oh it. No, missus, them

life, an’ I ain’t changin’ their attitood by

“C.E.”: Joe’s specialty was a study of
the district rainfall, but not being able
to get hold of a rain-gauge he showed
his independence by making one from a
cut-off oil-drum. A foot-rule measured
the catch near enough for Joe, who pains-
takingly recorded it to the nearest half-
inch in his weather diary. For a couple
of months there were no entries; then
the first spring rain arrived with a rush.
With a happy grin Joe watched the down-
pour for two days and part of the nights,
looked up past records and talked of the
coming season. Wet wood delayed his
breakfast next morning, but as soon as
it was over he made for his rain-gauge.
Presently there was a flow of curses, and
Sam poked his head out. “It all comes
of not having a proper fence,” Joe wailed
wrathfully. “All that rain, and only half
an inch. Half a blasted inch, mind y’,”
he bawled, “an’ cripes, we’d ’a’ had enough
t’ fill me dams easy if that thirsty flamin’
heifer from up the road hadn’t gone an’
beat me for about six inches of it!”

“Emjai”: I had picked up a kelpie-
pointer cross as a likely hunting-dog for
the lads. First night in his new quarters
he was bedded down in the woodshed.
At the back end of the allotment dwelt
the lone survivor of the table-birds. In-
vestigating noisy protests I found the
hound had routed the rooster from his
nest and was droving him down the yard.
He brought him straight and true into the
woodshed in a manner to win any sheep-
dog trial, and stood over him until he
had settled down for the night on a log.
Chanticleer didn’t hail the dawn, and
search disclosed his remnants behind the
woodheap. I am still pondering whether
the dog’s motive was provision for an
early breakfast, or a too-determined urge
to fraternise.
* * * *
“8.A.”: The activities of bushfire-
bugs such as the one alleged to have been
operating in the Cape Otway Ranges
(Vic.) usually stem from either vindic-
tiveness or near-insanity. One who caused
a headache to police and farmers in the
nor’-eastern Victoria district where I
spent my boyhood turned out to be a
lad from a Government institution who
was bond-slave to a local cocky. Ques-
tioned as to why he had turned firebug
the youth said he noticed there was
“always whips o’ scones an’ sandwiches,
an’ brownie, an’ sweet tea” provided at
bushfires, so he took this means of vary-
ing his Spartan fare of eternal boiled
rabbit and pumpkin with an occasional
scrap of corned-beef and a spud.

“D.R.H.”: Thirst, is it (B. 31/12/’47)?
Two days before Christmas I reached
the foot of Mt. Alec, a petrified breaker
rearing its 3700 feet not above the foot-
hills but straight up from a sea of gibbers
and sand. I was carrying a light gun and
containers for small animals and for
seeds —but no water. After a long
battle I reached the knife-edge summit,
and I was very parched—worse by even-
ing, when I reached the car again. I drank
a pint of lovely water, slowly splashed it
on my arms, chest and face, drank a little
more and had a smoke to dry my mouth
out and prolong the pleasure of the
guzzle. They claim T had four pots of
tea that night at home before I went to
bed, still thirsty. Waking next day, I had
a finer hangover than ever achieved by a
day on the grog.

“Sale”: Samoans are bound by no
rules in choosing names for their off-
spring. The unusual and the picturesque
make more appeal than the purely tra-
ditional. A minor Treasury official named
his twins Pei and Aloanisi, in which any
Pay Office authority will easily recog-
nise his dual gods Pay and Allowances.
A boy named Falesiva is a living re-
minder of the romance which led to his
begetting. Falesiva means “dance-hall.”
But perhaps the prize for originality must
go to the laboratory assistant, himself
named Okiseni (oxygen), who had his
numerous progeny christened with the
elements he worked among: Kalorini
(chlorine), Peromini (bromine), Naitero-
seni (nitrogen), Aiodini (iodine), Ilianu
(helium) and so on, right through the
chemistry-book. The eleventh child
found him almost bankrupt of ideas, but
he emerged triumphantly from two days
of concentrated thought with Sio Tu
CO2.

“Hanko”: With a yelp of delight the
cocker-spaniel leaped at the toy balloon
grounded on the lawn, but the thing
bouncdd away from him and wafted into
the air. Cocker eyed the air-borne sphere
with astonishment, sprang up at it, but
only bumped it higher. The dog
took time off to throw us a glance in
which was mingled annoyance and bewil-
derment. Slowly, the balloon settled to
earth. The spaniel stalked it warily ;
set himself for the leap, and was upon it
with scrabbling paws. A snap, and
the balloon was a frazzle of pink rubber.
There was mute inquiry in the wall-
flower eyes the dog turned upon us, and
something of shame, too. He slunk be-
neath a bush and whined dismally. No
dog can bear to be laughed at.
* * * *
“0.D.8.”: At last we’d found a site
for the dam after lugging the gear for
chains over the paddock. The boss
wasn’t satisfied. “It’s too near me boun-
dary-fence,” he said. ‘Me neighbors
rabbits will drink all the flamm water!

“Wonk”: Old Barney’s got rats in his
shanty. I camped with him for a night
or two and offered to get rid of ’em-
Rabbit-trap I use. Like a weak one best,
but Barney only had a newie, so 1 set
that and shoved it up on the roof. Hadn t
been asleep long when there’s a bump-
ing noise and I hopped up to release
a possum. Then I set it under the tank-
stand and just got to sleep when the cat
started a commotion. His own taun,
anyway, for sitting on the thing. ? An
hour later, hang me if it wasnt ol a
Moses. Barney won’t be followed for
a while by his dog, by the look of tha
foot. Well, a bloke had to get some
sleep, so I propped the door open a tew
inches and shoved the trap right where
a rat would be sure to walk on it.
it would’ve, too, if Barney hadnt gone
sneakin’ round in his socks before day-
light. I didn’t have to let him out, thougn
I might just as well, having to get up
anyway to put a bit of butter on my
where the trap landed. Barney, the ol
goat, reckons there are worse pests
around than rats. Some blokes are
funny, right enough.
CROSSING THE WARREGO.
The river was running a banker in flood
The day that we mustered the Irrara Plain,
And a hundred good horses, all beauty and
blood, , ,
Swept down to the crossing; and, foam on
the rein, , , , .
Four mud-spattered horsemen rode hard m
their train.
The chestnut that led them pulled up with a
snort , ,
When the rushing brown water lapped ovei
his feet;
A galloper this one, a thoroughbred sort,
Unbacked and unbroken but lissom and fleet,
An aristocrat out of Quality Street.
The big mob behind him slowed up to his lead,
Their lean heads uplifted, their wild manes
Checked suddenly out of their hurricane speed—
Though crammed full of courage, a moment
at loss ,
How to tackle this hurdle they knew they
must cross.
Beyond it stood opqn the horse-paddock gate
And the road through the sandals that led to
the yard, . ...
But beneath them was rolling that turbulent
spate, .
That threatening flood with the foam on it
starred; .
The masterful Warrego keeping his guard.
The horsemen came nearer, a stockwhip was
cracked * »
The laggards rushed forward, the leaders gave
way;
On the edge of the water the great mob was
packed, ~ , ,
And the chestnut stepped in with a beckoning
neigh
And behind him came plunging brown,
dapple, and bay.
Heads low on the water they breasted the creek,
Swung down by the current and tossed by the
tide
But all swimming strongly with cheek against
check
And pricked ears set forward, a squadron of
priSe „ , .
As they picked up the path from their
confident guide.
One rider went with them, one rider alone —
The others preferring to wait for the boat—
Our champion horseman, our Never-yet-thrown,
Our Not-to-be-beaten aground or afloat
When the trumpet of -challenge had sounded
its note.
With a tpuch of his heel to his high-couraged
ha^ek
He dropped in behind them with confident
smile,
Afloat on his saddle with reins lying slack,
Leaving everything now to his horse for a
while
And prepared for a swim if it covered a mile.
The bold chestnut leader stood first on the bank
And snorted in triumph, a picture of ;pride,
With a conquering glance at his following rank
While the sun turned to silver his glistening
hide
And a score of companions swept up to his
side.
Then biting and bustling and plunging in play
They spread out; and galloping all that they
knew
They raced for the gate with a nicker and neigh
Where a stockman sat mounted to steady
them through
And lead to the ridge where the sandalwood
grew.
At last safely yarded, the rails were shot home,
And, flowing of forelock and tangled of mane.
The wild mob washed clean of their sweat and
their foam
Stood waiting, high-headed, for drafting
again:
Thus we brought in the beauties from Irrara
Plain!
SCOTLAND.
Will H. Ogilvie.


“Old-timer”: Old Bluey Leslie, peace to
his ashes, hated to see things lying about.
Out in the Euston (N.S.W.) country rain
is so rare that when a storm blew up and
about 34 drops fell the hands at once
went round the homestead spouting to
make sure that all was clear for the water
to run to the tanks. Towards dusk rain
actually began to fall in spoonfuls, and
Norman and Little Curl discovered a
blockage in the woolshed gutters. Little
Curl held the ladder while Norman went
to the roof. He called down for a
hammer or file or something, and Curl
went off to get it, Norman huddling down
on the roof under the cornsack
he’d taken up. Home from town
in the wet dusk rode Bluey. He
sighted the ladder, muttered something,
gathered it in from the saddle and rode
to the stables. Curl appeared, saw that
the ladder was gone, concluded Norman
had cleared the blockage and moved on to
the homestead. Curl himself retired to
the hut. About then a real storm de-
veloped ; Norman, stranded on the roof,
began to howl for help, but it was two
hours before search-parties discovered him.
“My Lord,” remarked Bluey. “It’s bad
enough the way they treat tools; now
they’re startin’ t’ leave each other lyin’
about!”
* * * *
“Wippegong”; I’ve been back to the
old valley. The wattles, blackwoods and
willows reach farther across the little
river, so rufous whistlers and grey fannies
now cheer banks that were bare when
we were nippers, and the platypus has
followed cool eddies as the shade spread
down from the hills. With a fat season
caterpillars are plentiful, but the maggies
and plover have that matter in hand, and
one wonders just how much less the milk-
cheques would be without them. Intro-
duced fowl have spread; to the starlings
and sprigs we raided are added Indian
mynas and turtle-doves and the black-
bird, which has drawn vigorous but futile
curses from the growers of soft fruits.
Dusk in the old days brought a clear,
sweet song from a little brown sprite, the
striated field wren, perched on the highest
frond of the matted bracken lining the
road. The song vanished from there
years ago—maybe he didn’t like the black-
berries that overgrew the fern—but I
found the wee chap scurrying along 'the
foot of a fence where the cover was much
the same as I knew him to favor before.
On the roads the carts, buggies and sulkies
we “hung behind” on the way to school
would now be curios. Great semi-trailers
whisk the milk off to the city, tractors
purr their way around the district, power-
mowers and pick-up presses 7 snatch the
surplus grass from the paddocks and
“Happy birthday to you!”
leave, it in geometrical stacks. And pro-
phecy has been mechanised! Once you
could bank on rain if Danny McHugh
had a pain in his club-foot; but now —
“There’ll be a change within 48 hours!”
yelled Mrs. Regan, with never so much
as a glance at the sky, “Me ’frige is
froze up!”
* * * *
“derrick”: Grandpa, who, returning
from the city with bowler-hat and minus
ziff, was bailed up by the dogs (B.
21£l/,’48), must have discarded a charac-
teristic odor with beard and former head-
gear. The intelligent hound knows that
his sight is nothing to brag about, so he
confirms all first impressions of sight and
hearing by taking a sniff. Possibly
Grandpa had changed his brand of soap.
A N.S.W. medical man who took a
job in another State left his year-
old Airedale behind. Though four months
passed before the dog could be collected
he knew the doctor at once. But he
showed no interest in the doctor’s wife, of
whom he had previously been very fond.
Clothes, hats and shoes of former days,
worn especially to awaken the canine
memory, were of no avail. The Airedale
tolerated the lady respectfully, but he
just didn’t know her. She was in failing
health, and died about 12 months after-
wards. I feel sure the doctor, vigorous
and active, following his profession,
handling drugs and disinfectants as
formerly, presented to his dog a well-
known and easily-identifiable odor, while
the lady, undergoing dietary and other
treatment to combat disease, was olfac-
torily a stranger.

“Hanko”; While generally snakes
can’t bear the rays of a scorching sun
(B. 28 /1 1 ’4B), the tiger of the tribe has a
liking for shaded heat. A favored posi-
tion is along the flanges of per.-way
rails, and there they’ll lie in content until
disturbed and angered by an approach-
ing train or rail-trike. But even in fighting
trim the snake is a no-hoper. As “Boga-
duck” points out, experiments by ex-
perts have disclosed that the death-adder
may be rolled, prodded and otherwise
mishandled with impunity. To get the
thing to go off you must grasp the tip of
its tail, wind it up and ask it to say “99.”
Joe is overdue for a debunking, and I’ve
got a special grain of salt for that taipan
feller.
“Tiny”; I had often wondered why
the death-adder, whose lethargy, as
“Bogaduck” says (B. 28/l/’4B), is dissi-
pated only when his extrasensitive tail-
piece is touched, fell a victim so rarely to
the hooves of feeding stock, or why such
stock are seldom bitten. I lit on the
reason when tracking feeding stock
in some of Queensland’s heavy pear
country. When stock are moving slowly
in a body or if lone-feeding animals are
getting too near it the adder curves its
body into the shape of a new moon and
raises and lowers the bend, at the same
time twisting the body so as to show the
conspicuous creamy telly.
* * * *
“The 0.D,”: There is nobody quite so
credulous and ignorant of his own
country’s fauna as the average city
reporter, I wasn’t altogether astonished
to come across this in a Sydney paper:
Melbourne, Friday. An invasion of
large goannas, some over sft. long, is
worrying and sometimes scaring residents
in outlying districts of St. Arnaud, in
western Victoria. Today a 16-year-old
High School boy, Noel Petrie, was chased
across a paddock on his father’s farm at
St. Arnaud North by two goannas. Many
persons are afraid to cross fields at night
for fear of being attacked by goannas.
What does astonish me, however, is the
discovery of a St. Arnaud schoolboy who
could be bluffed by lizards. When I wore
the chocolate-and-blue cap we used to
snare and Scotch-hobble the brindle
bunyips in the old Lady Nelson dam.
* * * *
“M.U.R.”: I’m deeply interested in
that story of the cove who fished up a
blucher boot with a whiting in it (B.
11/2/’4B), but what I really want to see
is the bloke who wore bluchers of such a
size that a 3ylb. fish could live in one of
them.
# ; ♦ * *
“Tulka”: A post-mortem on a seal,
young or old, male or female, will in-
variably reveal up to a dozen rocks, the
size of goose eggs, in its stomach. One
theory is that they are swallowed to aid
digestion, similar to the pebbles in an
emu’s gizzard; another, that during such
times of the year when tucker is plenti-
ful and the water very cold, they put on
extra blubber, which gives them so much
additional buoyancy that the rocks are
taken aboard as ballast and render
it easy to dive. Yet another idea is that
they are swallowed accidentally when
grabbing at fish on broken bottom A big
bull seal has been known to yield as much
“Bring us another ’alf-dozen, Skinny, an we’ll build YOU an
armchair tomorrer."
as 201 b. of rocks. In many cases the
ballast has been established by geologists
as not being found within a few thousand
miles of where the seal died.,
* * =l= *
“Hep-2-3-4”; To our outfit came one
of those young “experts” who’d read up
a trifle about living off the land and ac-
cepted three “hooks” to broadcast his
knowledge. As he went around the dif-
ferent battalions he wisely stuck to such
generalities as how to snare fish if avail-
able, how to get water from tree-roots,
etc. He steered clear of any practical
example of wog-eating until the day a
pupil found a witchetty-grub. As the
mob urged “Go on, surge,” and grinned
like gargoyles, he found his prestige in
the balance, faltered, closed his eyes and
bit at it. When his face had finished
turning from a lime-green back to some-
thing near its normal hue he spat, un-
folded a weak smile and said “Splendid
taste! Something between an oyster and.
veal and, don’t forget, equally as
nutritious.”
* * * *
“Laetitia”: That hatter (B. 21 /1 / ’4B)
who preferred pigs on account of their
Falstaffian figures as more pleasing con-
versationalists than his lean and miser-
able hounds would not hold in high re-
gard the progeny of some of the Captain
Cookers which survive on a few
Torres Strait islands. When all vege-
tation dries off in the parching
south-east-wind season the pigs main-
tain a Spartan existence on crabs,
small fish and other marine life and car-
rion in the shallow reef-pools. Canine
chasers of tin-hares are quite fat in com-
parison with them. When crossed with a
domestic strain the offspring retains Only
the characteristic long snout of the wild
parent, but they are practically useless
as provender, the pork being about 90
per cent. fat.

“Mat’s Mate”; We were in the pickers’
camp at Pinkie Bend, Mildura, one grape
season and there was a lot of skiting
going on. “Well,” the big fellow said.
“You blokes all talk about the chances
y’ missed. Coupler years ago I nilly got
one o’ these fruit blocks; 21 acres it
was, with a house an’ a rubber-tyred
sulky an’ 14 acres in full bearin’ and one
o’ them pianola planners. Could ha’ got
the whole box an’ dice for nothin’, too.
Bloke that owned it was real keen on
handin’ it over. Y’ see, he’d lost his
missus an’ had a few quid an’ he wanted
t’ retire.” Mat paused and looked
dreamily over the river. “Well,” de-
manded somebody impatiently, “why
didn’t y’ take it on? Cripes, y’ could
ha’ bin sittin’ pretty now. What?”
Mat fixed him with a cold eye. “Aw, it
would ha’ bin all right,” he said. “Only
thing was I’d ha’ had t’ marry his daughter
t’ get it.” “Well, cripes, that would ha’
done me. What was wrong with that?”
“Not for mine, mate,” said Mat. “But
gosh,” he added wistfully, “there was a
bonzer creamy pony t’ go with that
sulky.”
* * * *
“McGinty”: Homing pigeons (B.
14 /1 1 ’48)? Not knowing how the brighter
birds return home, I can merely give in-
formation on one that did not. Arriving
at our week-ender on the tip of the
Mornington Peninsula (Vic.) we were sur-
prised to see a beautiful “silver” pigeon
with metal bands on the legs, feeding in
the yard ; neighbors informed us that it
had been there for days. At the local
store someone remembered reading of
the release of a number of Tasmanian
pigeons from Melbourne and that none
had arrived home. We phoned
a racing-pigeon club, gave the details,
and learned that it was a Tasmanian bird
and not to worry as it was only resting
(on its way to Tassie and it rests 60
miles from Melbourne for four days!)
and to take it to the beach and let it go.
Released as instructed the bird fluttered
heavenwards, swept around in a wide
circle and set off in the general direction
of the Speck. When we got back home
it was there waiting for.us at the back
door —where it stayed for three more
days until one of the kids took umbrage
and tried to clock it—not with a stop-
watch, but a saucepan.
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: Without being a
nocturnal feeder (B. 14/1/’4B) the goanna
or any animal could rob suburbia in
what that lethargic offshoot of civilisation
is pleased to regard as the hours of
darkness. To wild animals day corn-
menaces about an hour before sunrise,
when the earth is alive, the ground
springs to the tread, and the air is sweet.
Then for a few hours life throbs, to lapse
into morning lethargy when suburbia
awakes, draws in meagre draughts of
heat-haze, and marvels at the wonders of
an age whose scientific achievements are
directed, mainly, towards prolonging the
time in which newspapers may repose
peacefully on its front lawns.
* * * *
“Nor’-west”: The explanation of frogs
and fishes found after a downpour (B.
31/12/’47) is generally a waterspout, and
if a shoal happens to be handy when
the spout starts its initial whirls it goes
up along with the thousands of tons of
water, even 10-pounders. Once saw
hundreds of big mullet scattered over a
mud-flat quite five miles in from the
actual shore of King Sound, n.-w. W.A.
Not confined to the ocean, waterspouts
have occurred in inland waters —several
have been recorded on Melville Water,
the lakelike estuary of the Swan River,
near Perth—so a harvest of small frogs
could be picked up from the shallows
of a lake, carried perhaps hundreds of
miles by sheer wind pressure and then
dropped in the inevitable rain-shower.
* * * *
“Waddlin’ Willie”: The property of
James O’Shea, Barfold, Northern Vic-
toria, has added another huge tree to
assist the housing problem. Estimated to
be 200 years old, it took the contractor,
W. Carey, five hours to get through the
butt with a mechanical saw. It then
rested on its base for a week without
falling, finally having to be pulled off the
stump. The log gave 3400 super, feet;
the rest of the tree cut logs 81 feet in
length containing 11,500 super, ‘feet —
royalty value, £4O 15s.

“Esk D.”: “It’s not the sort o’ night
t’ be inside,” Ben said. “What about a
bit o’ fishin’? The big cod’d be on the
prowl a night like this.” “I’ve got that
wired-on meat hook and cutty line
ready,” Tom said enthusiastically. “An’
there’s a skinned rabbit in the safe he
might take a sniff at.” The old chaps
rowed by flattie to the channel through
the sandbars and baited-up. Tom was
about to cast out the line when the boat
lurched, he slipped, tumbled overboard
and floundered a few yards astern. Then
there was a dimple on the water as made
by a rising trout, only much bigger, and
Tom went down for keeps. The others
rowed to the bank and went for help
Days of dragging the river failed to find
any sign of Tom, and the hut-dwellers
soon gave up hope for success with the
grappling-irons. Their search goes on
for an enormous cod floundering in the
shallows with acute gastric pains, effects
of trying to digest the hardiest old liar on
the Murray.
FLESHPOTS.
So you have come to this, old china-plate!
You —who barred no living thing on earth;
Who never counted odds in size or weight—
A pacifist of large and flabby girth!
A glaze in eyes that blazed with battle lust —
Some principle at stake, a wrong to right,
Or just a vulgar brawl, a cause unjust—
Who cared? Not you! A fight was still a fight.
I wonder, in your torpor do you dream
Of pleasant things we knew in days gone by:
A spell beside a singing mountain stream;
A camp beneath a roof of stars and sky?
I see a woman’s hand behind your shame —•
And shame it is to see so grim a wreck —
You parody that mocks a gallant name:
“Old Tige” with ribbon tied around your
neck!

Sheep and Cattle.
“Ben Acre”: The question of
grazing cattle with sheep (B.
24/12/’47) could be carried
further to cover the drier inland
area of N.S.W. and Victoria.
This area is of extremely vari-
able carrying capacity and one
that should not be heavily
stocked. If lightly stocked with
sheep, which have a partiality
for fresh short feed, the sheep
have a tendency to graze on
selected areas, often eating them
almost bare before spreading to
other parts of the paddock,
where the grass has become
coarse or rank and has lost much
of its feed value. A better prac-
tice in light seasons is to stock
moderately heavily with sheep
for a time and Jthen leave the
paddock unstocked until it re-
covers. In heavier seasons cattle
should be run with the sheep in
such a proportion that they will
crop off the ranker growth;
actually making it better for the
sheep. There are seasons when
feed growth is so heavy that as
much as half the carrying
capacity of a paddock can be
devoted to cattle without inter-
fering with the sheep.
It is a part of proper farm
management to protect watering
places against damage by heavy
stock. Troughs can have a
fence built over them ; dams can
be fenced in such a way that
only sheep have access to cer-
tain portions of them, or a small
windmill can be used to pump
from it.
Seasonable Calving.
“Prof.”: The importance of
calving in the right season, or
even so exactly as in the right
month, is strikingly illustrated
in graphs compiled from records
of the various herd-testing asso-
ciations in S.A. For districts
relying on winter rains for the
bulk of feed, production can be
increased by calving all cows in
the autumn, with April calving
as the aim. In irrigated areas,
where the bulk of pasture
growth is in late spring and
early summer, late winter and
early spring is the best time for
calving. Five to six months be-
fore the peak-pr duction period,
as found by reference to cream
or milk returns, is a good esti-
mate of the month to calve dairy
stock in the better dairying dis-
tricts.
The general tendency appears
to be to bring the cows in about
two months late to coincide with
the break of the season. If a
cow is in reasonably good con-
dition her production will in-
crease for the first month or two
irrespective of the quantity of
feed available. Following this
natural flush there is a gradual
decline until eventually the cow
dries off. It is at the commence-
ment of this second stage that
the feed must be coming on if
production is to be maintained.
It is essential that each cow be
dried-off for at least a month —
preferably two months—so that
they can maintain themselves in
good condition before calving.
All cows cap be dried-off at the
one time (i.e., in the two worst
months of the year) if months of
calving are restricted, with the
result that the dairyfarmer can
snatch a well-earned holiday.
The question is how to get
cows to come in regularly in a
restricted period. Main thing is
to see that the bull is at the peak
of fertility when he is most
needed. Many farmers keep
their bulls in a state of semi-
starvation, pleading that they
do not work if allowed to de-
velop any condition—which is
rot. To get a herd in calf quickly
the bull must be fed with as
much as he will eat. Further,
he must be under a certain
"Well, she's really earned a little comfort; she's had a
cow of a life."
amount of restraint so that he
does not become overworked.
Let him serve a cow once, then
yard him away from her.
Rabbits and Other Pests.
“Eastern”: The grazier who
cleans up his land (B. 7/1/’4B)
deserves more protection than
he is getting. With his boundary
fences becoming annually worse
through the inability to buy
material, the rabbits from his
easygoing neighbors and in-
fested Crown lands continually
find a way into his better pas-
tures. With hired labor a thing
of the past, rabbit-traps unpro-
curable, and ammunition nearly
so, he is up against it trying to
cope with neighboring vermin.
Instead of the inadequate light
fine for offenders, perhaps the
remedy lies in a much heavier
penalty, if some means of inde-
pendent policing could be
found whereby the measure
could be rigidly enforced on all
parties responsible for rabbit-
infested land.
Further, a priority for land-
holders to buy cartridges would
not be “making rabbit-killing a
graziers’ sport.” Graziers are
far too busy these days to in-
dulge in sport. And, as things
are, the man living near the re-
tailer or, more likely, the man
with a friend in the shop, gets
the ammo. The outbacker hasn’t
a chance. There are certain cir-
cumstances when he needs bul-
lets for rabbits, but for foxes,
crows, wombats, dingoes and
orchard nuisances he needs them
still more. With an empty rifle
and pests killing his stock, be-
lieve me it’s not a fair go to
constantly meet 40-hour-weekers
on holiday from the city blazing
away good ammo at any and
every target.
Wheat on Darling Downs.
“Archaps”: Results achieved
with new rust-resistant wheats
on the Darling Downs this
harvest may revolutionise
wheat-growing there. Gabo,
Kendee, Celebration, Charter
and Yalta were widely grown
from seed harvested last year by
J. E. Bligh, Anchorfield, Brook-
stead, who is working in close
co-operation with Professor
Waterhouse, of Sydney Uni-
versity. Gabo did particularly
well, yields of up to 68 bushels
per acre being reported. Bligh
himself had only a small ex-
perimental area of spring wheats,
which are to be in a new
technique for controlling black
oats.
Old ground, heavily infested
with black oats, is to be sown
with wheat about the end of
January; normally this pad-
dock would have to be sown
with oats or fallowed. Taking
advantage of the rapid nitrogen
build-up during the unusually
wet summer, this wheat should
be ready for harvesting in April
or May, at which time black
oats are starting to germinate,
and the latter can then be
ploughed in.
Bligh reports outstanding re-
sults from a small area sown 1
with a new wheat, evolved by
crossing Gabo with Pusa 4, and
Frank Thomas, also of Brook-
stead, has 130 acres of Charter
wheat, sown on September 12,
which survived one of the worst
rust seasons experienced on
Darling Downs. It was to be
ready for stripping about the
middle of January. Kendee
yielded 16 bags to the acre off
a virgin paddock.
Mouthing a Colt.
“Wirrameju”: Mouthing is
too often looked upon merely
as a method of making a horse
turn left or right at a pull of
the rein. In some circles the
idea still exists that it is neces-
sary that the horse’s mouth be
made sore, I have even seen
farmers filing the corners of a
colt’s mouth to achieve this end.
In a well-broken colt, all the
necessary signals are radioed to
the horse from the rider’s hands,
via the reins. If your colt is to
be susceptible to delicate indi-
cations (and not “club-headed”
round on his bit) it is essential
that extreme care and delicacy
be practised during his mouth-
ing. The bit should be on the
bars of the lower jaw, not half-
way up his head as in hard-
mouthed or sky-gazing horses.
He must be taught to act as in-
dicated ; not forced to act as
desired.
Firstly, place a bridle on the
colt and a surcingle round his
girth. A bar-sided snaffle is the
best bit for this,
but not essential.
Pass the near rein
through the sur-
cingle at a point a
few inches above
his elbow and tie it
firmly there so that
the colt’s head is
turned slightly to
the near side. At
any rate, so that he
can’t turn his head
to the off side. Re-
move the off rein.
Start him moving
round the yard to
the left, slowly at
first and, as he be-
comes used to it, at
a smart trot. Make
every effort to pre-
vent him turning to
the off side. If he
should do so, insist that he
turn back to the near side, and
reward him. He is being taught
to answer the bit on one side.
The pressure of the bit should be
very slight and only as much as
necessary for him to feel it. As
soon as he is going steadily,
time the operation, give him a
short, complete rest, and change
the tackle to the offside. Re-
verse the process, circling him
to the off side. It is important
that he be given exactly the
same time on each side, or he
will become a one-sided “black-
fellow’s” horse.
Watch the corners of his
mouth. Some colts will answer
the bit quietly, while others will
fight it all the way to the detri-
ment of their mouths, A small
scale-like piece of skin may be
lifted with the bit. This is the
danger signal—the lifting of the
hard outer skin. The colt’s
mouth is not broken, but its
first line of defence is gone.
Remove the bit immediately,
rub some grease on the mouth
and turn the colt loose.
Whatever you may hear, no
good can possibly come of a
broken mouth and it is to be
avoided like the plague. Good
judgment and observation and
a delicate handling of the reins
during and after mouthing will
go a long way to making a con-
fident and quiet hack. A broken
and sore mouth will make him
unhappy, sour and cranky.
Next day, repeat the mouth-
ing process until the colt goes
along willingly and steadily with
the breaker walking a safe dis-
tance behind him. Remove the
bridle-reins, ‘fix rings on the
surcingle a few inches above
the elbows and attach a long
pair of driving-reins, leading
them, from behind, through
the rings, to his bit. Drive him
on each side for a few minutes,
gradually shortening the time on
each side until you can turn him
at will. Giving him a set figure-
eight course is best, as he will
learn this quickly and make his
turns as soon as they are indi-
cated. Vary the course by put-
ting in an extra turn occasion-
ally.
It is not advisable to take him
out of the yard at this stage,
unless he is going extremely
well —quietly and intelligently.
If you should do so, first fit him
with a stout neck-rope and have
someone hold it loosely through-
out his schooling. (If he de-
cides to bolt, you will have no
control at all from behind him,
and bolters begin this way.) An
attempt to bolt will be inevi-
table in a colt which is nervous
and jumpy in the yard. As you
proceed with his breaking, drive
him a little each day. Avoid
pulling and twitching the reins
and use only the amount of
steady pressure necessary to
achieve your end, no more.
Lightness cannot be stressed too
strongly. Treat your reins as
though they were cotton threads
and likely to snap, and your colt
will be one which literally can
be guided by a piece of cotton.
Minerals for Stock.
“Mr.”: As a bone-builder for
growing stock and for breeding
and milking animals calcium
phosphate takes beating. The
best way to get it to stock is to
topdress the pastures with super-
phosphate. Meatmeal also con-
tains a fair proportion of cal-
cium phosphate, and if fed in a
protein supplement no further
calcium will be needed. Most
concentrates, grain particularly,
are deficient in lime, but this
can be made good in the rations
of horses, cattle, sheep and pigs
by feeding 31b. of a mixture of
four parts of lime to one part of
salt in each 1001 b. of grain.
Poultry will obtain sufficient
lime from their shellgrit, and
will benefit by the addition of
lib. of salt to each 1001 b. of
mash.
Erosion Control.
“W. Court”: Thousands of
farms in Queensland are gradu-
ally being ruined by the old up-
and-down-the-hill form of culti-
vation. The soil is washed from
the top ends of fields to the bot-
toms, there to bury fences and

IS YOUR SLAVE
Cooidng with an AGA is so easy, so
dean, and so much better. Day or
night it's ready whenever you want to
use it. AGA burns continuously a
hot oven whenever you need it.
Fuel cost? Incredibly small. AGA's
amazing heat-storage principle enables
it to give maximum efficiency with a bare minimum of fuel
in fact it is the only cooker in the world that is guar-
anted not to bum more than a stipulated quantity (which
varies with each model).
As for kitchen comfort, AGA cookers are scientifically insu-
lated. AU outside surfaces (except the hot plates] remain
cool, which means a comfortable room temperature at
all times.
Investigate AGA cooking. Call at any of our branches for
a demonstration, or write for illustrated booklet showing
how AGA cooking will save you time, work and money!

“Knowledge is of two kinds, we either have it ourselves or we know
where to find it from others.”— Dr. Samuel Johnson.

A shrewd analysis from the lips of the immortal Doctor
—true enough in the calm of pre-industrial England
and of greater significance in these days of specialised
knowledge.
We at Babcock are specialists in our knowledge of
thermal engineering. Our beginnings were rooted in
the pioneering days of the simple hand-fed, low tem-
perature and pressure boiler. In the passing decades,
our engineers followed the path of world industriai
expansion, studied the behaviour of foreign fuels,
climates and operating conditions, installed Babcock
boilers throughout the world and, supported by
the research of chemists, metallurgists and engineers in
Babcock laboratories, amassed the knowledge which
enabled us to develop the modern high temperature and
pressure boiler to an unprecedented peak of economy
and efficiency.
This knowledge is available to solve your specific steam
problems; we shall be happy to co-operate with you.
Looking to tomorrow, we at Babcock & Wilcox are planning to
put to use the newly-acquired industrial and technical abilities of
Australia.
This planning gives recognition to the unexcelled facilities of our
British organisation for designing, testing and research, and
envisages a close co-operation to ensure that boiler plant built
in Australia will embody latest design practices and production
techniques.

silt once - permanent water-
courses.
It doesn’t need a marked slope
in a cultivation paddock* to
make run-off rapid and strong
enough to carry hundreds of
tons of topsoil to the lower
headland during a violent storm.
Take, for example, the cane-
fields on the coastal slopes.
During the early summer months
the inter-row spaces have to be
continuously worked to control
weed-growth. Sudden down-
pours send torrents of water
downhill between the cane-rows,
washing away tons of loosened
soil.
The summer storms cannot be
stopped, but washing down the
rows can be eliminated by cut-
ting across the slopes instead of
up and down them. With the
rows of cane crossing its course,
the downhill flow of run-off
water is slowed, more water
soaks' in and there is no loss of
soil. The upper outside furrow
also acts as a trap for water
coming down from above the
field, and conducts it around the
field instead of down through it.
Fowl Perches.
“J.J.A.”: Fowls like wide
roosts. Instead of sleeping rest-
ing on their legs as is character-
istic of flying birds, they support
themselves op their breastbones'.
Give them perches at least three
inches wide, either placed close
enough together to prevent the
fowl getting underneath or cover
the roosts with wire netting.
Block the birds from getting to
their manure.
This keeps the fowl manure
pure and it can be sold or used
with good effect on lucerne, pas-
ture, vegetable or fruit-trees.
More important still, manure
carries germs, particularly of
pullorum, which means a
healthier pen of fowls if they
are kept away from their drop-
pings.
Hints for the Farm.
“Double One”: A widespread
belief among wheatgrowers is
that if you leave your grain in
the paddock for a considerable
time after harvesting, the loss in
weight when it eventually
arrives at the silo is serious. R.
Fairman, of Yalca (Vic.), put
this to the test. He took a bag
of wheat, weighed it carefully
and left it in the paddock for
six weeks, exposed to the sun
and the four winds of Heaven
in a very dry period. He then
weighed it again and found it
1 arlb. heavier. Evidently it had
absorbed that much moisture.
“B. Acre”: It will often be
found with a direct-action
windmill that the pump cylinder
is much more than twice the
length of the mill stroke. Then,
if the plunger is set to work
within the lower half of the
cylinder, there is sufficient length
above, after that portion is
worn, for another stroke. Each
stroke-setting wears a length of
cylinder equal to the mill stroke
plus the length of cylinder occu-
pied by the pump-buckets.
When re-setting a part-worn
cylinder, the entire stroke must
work either within the worn
part of the cylinder or in an
unworn part.
“Woolly”: “Mr.” writes him-
self down as a man of localised
experience when he asserts (B.
28/1/’4B) “The good farmer no
longer scoops out a dam as a
watering-place. Wherever one
of these fluke- and mosquito-
infested mud-wallows disfigures
his property he fills it in,” etc.
By far the greater area of good
Merino sheep country carries no
fluke. Also, a very great deal
of that country, having no river
frontage, and bore-water being
unobtainable, without dams
would carry no sheep, few, if
any, cattle.
“E. 2”: In this Victorian dairy-
ing district farmers fiqd trouble
through having bulls run with
cows before the time for mating
(B. 21 /1 / ’4B). Fence-breakers
are generally the result of weak
fences and bad management, as
happens with most stock. When
the bull has had access to one
or two cows he will be restless
and cagey; if he breaks out once
after that he is likely to do so
on every occasion he can, and,
with the rogue habit established,
an electric fence will be needed
to stop him. But, with the bull
turned with the cows from mat-
ing on till the calving he can
usually be kept quietly in a
secure bull-paddock for the two
or three months till required.
It’s the uncontrolled before-sea-
son activity that incites mischief.
“Myrrhee”; As an alternative
to dusting poultry for lice try
dipping. Add a quarter-pint of
lysol to 3gal. of water warmed
to slightly above bloodheat.
Hold the bird by the wings and
lower all but the head into the
solution; quickly rub the
feathets up the wrong way and
immerse the head for a second.
Then, holding the bird over the
dip to prevent waste, squeeze out
excess fluid from the feathers.
Treat in the morning in reason-
ably good weather. Repeat in
10 days.
“Gip”: A 44-gal, drum makes
a good copper stand. Cut the
top out, turn the drum upside
down and cut a circle out of the
bottom big qnough to allow the
copper to fit down and so that
its rim will catch on the drum.
Cut a door about 6in. by 9in. in
the side about 6in. from the
bottom and hinge it. Wire a
piece of steel mesh just below
the door for a grate. A piece
of downpiping with an elbow
makes a good flue.

“A Prague youth, arrested for
throwing a bottle at a girl, told
police he just wanted to make her
acquaintance.”
“Charmante!” said the
Baron, and kissed his fingers ex-
plosively in the direction of a
Junoesque lady four tables
away. “You will note,” he
added in an aside which shook
the chandelier, “that the lady is
unescorted.”
“But that is” I began. The
Baron silenced me with a single
blow.
“I shall introduce myself in
the courtly fashion of the
Ptomanian bureaucracy. Of
which,” he added modestly, “I
am a distinguished scion.”
Seizing a hydrangea from the
table vase, he tossed it negli-
gently towards the lady’s table.
The aerodynamic properties of
hydrangeas being unpredictable,
it fell short and landed in the
lap of a colonel of the Vul-
garian Guards, who glanced ap-
prehensively at the ceiling and
left without waiting for his bill.
“Peste!” said the Baron, and
cast about for a better introduc-
tory missile. He picked up his
roll of Vulgarian black bread,
and this time found a mark in
the lady’s soup. He smirked
gallantly as she looked in our
direction through a mask of
consomme royal. The next
moment his roll, with its already
formidable weight doubled by a
thorough soaking, took him be-
tween the eyes.

however, how he flounders
around weakly when he finds
himself, as now, properly caught.
Our esteemed member ‘Cutty’
Hunck baited him with a live
question as to a point of order,
and he’s been trying to wriggle
off the number-seven ever since.
Moreover, whenever there’s talk
of the association fighting for its
rights he goes green around the
gills and turns a yellow tail. He
claims to work like a nigger on
our behalf. / think he’s as use-
less as a wirrah!”
At this mortal insult the
president bit —hook, line and
sinker. “Strike!” he exclaimed.
“Here a man’s doing his best for
the likes of you sea-lice, but
you’d crab anything!”
“Corpo di Bacch”
i “And what’s more, it’s always
you small fry in the game who
are never satisfied. Why, some
of you even try to scale out of
paying your subscriptions. I’m
not one to carp, but when some
members sponge on their fel-
low”—
“Sapristi! You insulta da
hones’ feeshaman who pusha da
mullet-gut on da hook all-a day,
unwind da buncha da grape,
pulla da hook out of da cob-
ber’s lug, sect in-a da boat from
befora da sparrowchirp an’
get-a da wet whatsthis an’ no
feesh”
“Garn, Tony, y’ make more
noise than a drummer.”
“Shut up, Kingy. If you
showed more interest in gettin’
a diff’rent kind of schooner
across a bar you’d do better,”
“Hop outside, Taylor, and I’ll
boot y’ in the grummet! ”
“Order! Order! Now have
any more of you hardyheads got
anything further to say on the
motion?”
“Yair. Why hasn’t the com-
mittee done somethin’ about that
bunch o’ sharks that sell our
fish at the markets?”
“Order! Order! The mem-
ber must not use the term
‘shark’ in a derogatory sense. He
should remember that the sea-
lawyer is the basis of all our
present prosperity. Admittedly,
one occasionally is responsible
for only the head of a snapper
or jewie being pulled up, and he
sometimes takes a playful snap
at a netful of mullet or leather-
johnnies. But, gentlemen, where
would we be, I ask you, if the
restaurants who specialise in
fried snapper were to demand
snapper ? No, gentlemen, never
forget that everything in a sand-
paper skin, whether it be
gummy, or hammerhead, tiger or
greynurse is doing a grand job
for us. Let us, therefore, show
our gratitude by refraining from
the comparison of some alleged
humans up at the markets with
the big beauties with the under-
slung jaws and triangular fins
who are netting us two bob a
pound.”
“Hear, hear!” yelled “Blue”
Poynter.
Just as the president was
about to put the motion the
roar went up that the blankards
at the back had broached the
keg of burley. Voting on the
motion was adjourned while the
main business of the evening
was being conducted, though not
without considerable confusion,
for members had to put their
glasses down so they would have
both hands free to describe, in
concertina-style, the varying size
of the one that, just barely
hooked, escaped when he
bumped his nose on the gun’l
when being pulled in.
Some time later, as they were
doing quite a bit of reeling,
“Blue” Poynter asked “Slimy”
MacArell how the voting went
on the last motion.
“Slimy” wept into his beer.
“Blashted presh’dent beat it,” he
sobbed.
“Wha’ —nicked orf?”
“No, flathead beat the
motion. Used hish castin’ vote,
the cow! ”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4|d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
Working Hours
The application of the 40-hour week
to small industries and businesses will
have some nasty effects.
Consider a bush sleeper-mill employ-
ing up to a dozen men, with a reduction
of four hours meaning a loss of eight
loads per fortnight—equal to £5O in hard
cash.
Although the average proprietor of a
spot mill may make big money some-
times over short periods, it is ex-
tremely doubtful if he averages over 12
months a net income of £25 a week.
Obviously, if his weekly takings are to be
reduced by £25 while his operating ex-
penses remain the same, he must go out
of business.
Where is the big monopoly to step in
and take his place? The working owner,
personally liable for production and profit
or loss, is on the job and for his own
sake must get it done. Big enough
timber monopolies may exist to take over,
but they just won’t do it with these small
shows, because, with wage-earners in
charge, they know full well that produc-
tion could not possibly be held up to
similar levels..
It follows also that if the game gets
too hot for the working owner, nobody
else is likely to make a profit, so we
have one unit completely out of produc-
tion, and a number of men on the market
looking for work within a suddenly re-
stricted economy. This certainly doesn’t
apply to timber mills only—they’re just a
single illustration of what will happen
everywhere.
The casual assumption that “small
shows don’t matter” is fraught with
danger, and the cumulative drop in
general production and efficiency if they
go out of business could not be guessed
at. It would almost certainly result in
an even greater shifting of population to
urban areas where the big concerns oper-
ate.
We work not for the sake of working,
but to produce the things that make life
worth living. We shall realise that in due
course.—R. H. G. (W.A.).
Backyard Orchards
The N. S. Wales Government’s decision
to deal with backyard fruitgrowers who
don’t keep their trees free of pests—they
will be liable to a fine of up to £so—is
long overdue.
For years the registration of all fruit-
trees, and the treatment or destruction of
unhealthy trees, has been compulsory in
N. S. Wales, but while the law has been
rigorously enforced against commercial
growers the backyard orchardist has not
been worried.
There are thousands of yards in the
suburbs and country well-stocked with
fruit-trees that never receive attention
and which are riddled with disease. They
not only make it hard for neighbors to
keep their fruit pest-free, hut in many
cases they infect commercial orchards.—
Sam (N.S.W.).
R.A.A.F. Wireless Reserve
“T.P.V.” (B. 4/2/’4B) is right off the
beam in criticising the R.A.A.F. for not
keeping its war-time wireless-operator-
mechanics in training! R.A.A.F. H.Q. has
announced the re-forming of its pre-war
wireless reserve, a body which provided
400 trained wireless-operators at the
beginning of the war, R.A.A.F. signals
would have been in a bad mess in 1939
and 1940 had it not been for these chaps
—they immediately the point-to-
point watches and held the fort until the
service was able to train more ops.
The post-war reserve, to be formed in
consultation with the Wireless Institute
of Australia, will train members in
Morse and radio and radar theory and
practice. It will be a valuable emergency
communication link in times of distress
such as bushfires or floods. Bhlistment
will be entirely voluntary, and the
R.A.A.F. is expected to provide some
equipment.
When bushfires raged throughout
Eastern Victoria in September, 1939,
P-M.G. telephone and telegraph com-
munication was broken. Hundreds of
people faced isolation and possible ex-
tinction. Members of the R.A.A.F.
wireless reserve were quickly on the scene,
and thjeir battery-powered transmitters
brought joy to the isolated, and carried
pleas for food to Red Cross headquarters
in Melbourne. Their work gained the
front-page of every Australian newspaper
and praise from the P.M.G.
If “T.P.V.” is anxious to continue his
radio interest he can still join the ranks
of the Australian radio amateurs and send
his Morse signals around the world until
his ears buzz.— Waddlin' Willie (Vic.).
Life Assurance
Proof of age before payment of life-
assurance claims (B. 4/2/’4B) does not
present any serious difficulty, nor is the
practice of life offices unfair in this
regard. Their experience has shown that
it is not practicable to insist on age evi-
dence before writing a policy, but one of
the basic principles of life assurance is
that the premium charged should be ade-
quate to cover the risk —actuarially com-
puted—for the correct age.
The excellent and comprehensive
Commonwealth “Life Insurance Act,
1945,” would have contained some pro-
vision on this subject had it been con-
sidered equitable and but while
the Act lays down the method of adjust-
ment of errors in age, it wisely refrains
from specifying any particular time dur-
ing the life of the contract for production
of the evidence.
Most companies include with a policy
“ Smartly , girls —WE'LL show these men!”
when issued a leaflet urging the new
member to submit age evidence at his
earliest convenience, and pointing out
that submission of such proof during his
lifetime must obviously be more satis-
factory to both parties than allowing the
duty to devolve upon his executor.
Birth-registration has been compulsory
for so long in Great Britain, New Zealand
and Australia that there can be very
few cases in which a certificate could not
be obtained by air-mail within a fort-
night. In the odd exceptions all respon-
sible companies are prepared to accept
the best evidence available, supported by
a statutory declaration by the claimant
or some relative. — Brutus (Q.).
Save for Security?
A thrifty Australian who lived a good
honest life regularly scraped a few shil-
lings aside for his old age as well as con-
tributing to a superannuation fund. When
he retired he had £550 in the bank and a
superannuation cheque of £3 a week. His
super, and bank balance debar both his
wife and himself from the old-age
pension.*
Now take the case of a free-spender
who went his merry way spending every
penny he earned. Each week an amount
was deducted from his pay for superan-
nuation and, six months before retiring
age, he learned that he could draw the lot
in a lump sum of £lOOO. He did and
bought a home with the money. Having
no income on retirement both he and his
wife now collect the old-age pension.
It’s a strange Government which be-
seeches us to save while encouraging us
to spend all we have. —B. R. (N.S.W.).
“Titoslavia”
The eulogy of that land by “Ek-Nx”
(B. 28 /1 /’4B) bears the hallmark of
honesty. It reminds me of the compli-
ment paid a dead Irishman by his tearful
widow: “Shure he was a foine man when
he was sober, but shure he was never
sober.”
“E.-N.” cannot understand how any man
ef leisure could leave the beauty of the
Dalmatian coast, but admits that nobody
is at leisure to enjoy the scenery—“ Ever-
yone is working, and working hard.” He
claims that all civil servants are civil,
but admits that the civility is compulsory,
the alternative being incarceration in a
labor camp.
There is great progress in transport and
housing, but at the expense of parents
and elderly people, who suffer from the
general austerity without hope of reward
in their lifetime —“Respect for the aged is
less evident than it used to be.”
“E.-N.” does not contradict the sug-
gestion that the returning exiles are
moved by an impulse stronger than nos-
talgia or patriotism. He leaves the im-
pression that everything in “Titoland”
is done by compulsion rather- than for
love, and that the fate of each individual
is fixed by a dictatorship from which
there is no appeal.
“Titoslavia” would be a foine land to
live in if it were free, but shure it isn’t
free at all at all.— lf (S.A.).
Postscript to a Strike
To F. Gallagher, chairman of the
Central Coal Reference Board,’goes the
distinction of being one of the first to
stand up against strike dictatorship in
N. S. Wales. His suspension for three
months of the new award for F.E.D.F.A.
members because they caused the
loss of 137,000 tons of coal indicates
that he means business.
The day before the strike began
Gallagher warned the union that he would
suspend the award if they held slopwork
meetings the following day. He subse-
quently proved that he meant what he
said. I was at the conference when he
told the F.E.D.F.A. he would not alter
his decision, and there was no uncertainty
in how he spoke. ,
“The disobedience of this order calls
for something more than a scowl of dis-
approval,” he said. “And were it not for
the fact that the strike ended quickly,
the board might have been inclined to
increase the penalty.... Strikes in the
coal industry,” he pointed out, “disrupt
the whole economy of Australia,.and are
capable of reducing its population to the
level of serfs. It is not unlikely that, 1
in future, much more drastic action will
be demanded.”
H. Sutherland, State secretary of the
F.E.D.F.A., told Gallagher he would
challenge the decision on the ground that
the Central Coal Reference Board was
not properly constituted. One of the
mine secretaries chipped in with, “You’ll
be killing the goose that laid the golden
egg, Hughie! ” There’s a lot behind that
statement. Even miners agree that
Gallagher has given their claims the ut-
most in sympathethic consideration.
This last strike by about a thousand
men in the coal industry not only
threatened the livelihood of hundreds of
thousands in general industries, but
actually threw 17,000 of the strikers’
workmates out of work for three days.
Typically, the increased week-end penalty
rates demanded by the union affected
only 80 continuous process workers —be-
cause they wanted an extra few shillings
a shift thousands lost three days’ wages,
industry was seriously threatened, and, as
usual, housewives suffered untold incon-
venience and were threatened by a Labor
Government with £5OO fines if they
“scabbed” on the strikers by using gas.
How different from Victoria, where
Premier Hollway has seen that fines are
directed at the instigation of unwarranted
strikes and not at those who suffer by
them.
Still, the signs are, that Gallagher is
viewing things from the same sane angle
as Hollway, and both of them have even
more supporters than they realise. —
M. W. W. (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
Early in the war many servicemen
bought blocks of land intending to build
their own homes. Apparently they had
too much faith in the rulers of their
country—the outcome of such plans
is an only-too-common story. After
paying exorbitant rents for “furnished
■ flats,” generally consisting of one or two
rooms cluttered with rubbish, the men
are now broke. In cases without num-
ber the blocks of land have been sold,
and the sordid conditions of the present
are only matched by the hopelessness of
the future. — Bramley (S.A.).
Eurasians, of whom there are more
than 150,000 in India, are in for a very
thin time under Nehru’s New* Order, and
many will leave the country. Although
they have their faults these people of
mixed British and Indian blood are
attractive and intelligent and proud of
their white blood. Their cultural back-
ground is European rather than Asiatic,
and for the most part they are loyal
British subjects, speaking English as a
matter of course. There should be no
insuperable problem in settling, say,
50,000 of them in Australia’s N.T. We,
and particularly the Territory, need the
population sadly enough, and it would be
better to have a loyal race with some
British strain now than a mob of hostile
Indonesians and Asiatics later. —K. A. S.
(N.S.W.).
Yorkshire “Post,” the Eden family
paper, has come out with an article on
“the need for an Empire secretariat, as
suggested by John turtin.” Deakin sug-
gested it to Downing-street when Curtin
was in knickerbockers. Back in Aus-
tralia, he returned to the Treasury a
large part of the modest sum assigned to
him for expenses. No “Labor” globe-
trotter has followed the great Alfred in
that. — Balaclava (Vic.).
General Blarney says that in-
creases in pay under which Citizen
Force brigadiers are to get £250 a year
for about three full days of work a week
and privates 10s. a day and upwards,
normally for 28 days in the year, “will
not help the defence of Australia.” What
“defence of Australia”? Denison

Any wheatgrowef with a moment to
spare can get in the shade of a Pollard
promise and work out what this means:
Australian home-consumption price, 6s.
3d.; world export parity, 205.; sold by
Canberra to Britain, 80 million bushels
at 175.; by Canberra to India, 25 million
at 18s; 6d.; by Canberra to New Zealand,
18 million at ss. 9d. The answer should
be forwarded, postage-paid, to Ms.H.R.
for wheat districts. —O. T. (N.S.W.).
Chairman Bell, of the Melbourne
Tramways Board, made the quaint
suggestion that parklands and other
“waste areas” should be used as car-
parks, and followed that up by offering,
off his own bat, to lay tram-tracks to the
areas filched from the city’s lungs to
carry motorists to their place of business.
The storm of protest it aroused must have
convinced him that Bell had struck a
false note. —S. G. M. (Vic.).
Much of the congestion on our main
roads would be relieved—and the accident
rate thereby reduced —if more attention
were paid to secondary roads. Families
out for a day’s pleasure like to get off
the beaten track. But because secondary
roads are in such a shocking condition
they will not risk damage to their cars
or suffer the bone-shaking - agony of a
drive over corrugations, ruts and every-
thing else that should not be found
on a decent road. —W. P. T. (N.S.\y.).
To alleviate the present' shortage of
bags for farmers, couldn’t potatoes be
marketed in barrels? This has been done
in Jersey (Channel Islands) for many
years, the barrels being returned empty
at a reduced rate to the growers. They
lasted at least one season, and, as Jersey
has never been well-off for timber, there
must have been good reasons for the use
of wood. —E. and O.E. (Tas.),
Of course, things are not made to last
these days (B. 21/l/’4B). If they were,
supply would soon overtake the demand
and the loss of capital caused by idle
machinery and factory space would
make mass-production financially impos-
sible. In some lines, such as cars and
women’s clothing, where normal wear
and tear is not sufficiently destructive, a
system of fashions maintains an artificial
demand. But the effect of the “cheap
and shoddy” system on national economy
has, apparently, never been considered.
— Mullum (N.S.W.).
Why doesn’t Sydney adopt the Bris-
bane idea of printing tram-tickets a little
