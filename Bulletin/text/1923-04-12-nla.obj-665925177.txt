The Two Greatest Successes
of the Motor-car Industry
NO Accessory has ever been introduced to the Motor-car World
that has met with such unanimous approval as the Stewart
Patented Magnetic type of Speedometer. Laboratory and road
tests on the part of exacting Automotive Engineers, extending over 1 7
years, have proved conclusively the Stewart is without an equal for
accuracy, reliability and durability. As a result, 95 per cent, of Motor-
car Manufacturers to-day are using the Stewart Patented Magnetic
Speedometer as standard equipment. There are De Luxe models for
De Luxe cars. There is also a special Ford model, which has colored
figures, showing up at intervals to remind the driver when oil is required
for various parts of the car.
THE success of the Stewart Vacuum System is history. From the
day it was designed its popularity has increased by leaps and
bounds, until to-day it stands as a recognised standard means
of supplying fuel to the carburetter. It has almost entirely supplanted
other Feed Systems, as evidenced by the fact that nearly 90 per cent,
of all Car Manufacturers now use the Stewart Vacuum System as
standard equipment. The balance nearly all use the air pressure or
gravity systems. After years of trial, the Stewart Vacuum System
remains tlie proved, dependable, absolutely-certain, always-on-the-job
method of feeding fuel to the engine. If you are using a pressure or
gravity-feed system on your car, replace it with a Stewart—you will
never regret it.
OTHER Stewart Accessories that have made a
name for themselves are Stewart Indestructible
Spring Steel Bumpers, Electric and Hand-
operated Signals, De Luxe Searchlights, Rear Vision
Mirrors, Stop Signals, etc.

The Woman Novelist
For more than a century the world has
been familiar with the woman of literary
pretensions; but of late years she has in-
creased and multiplied till it is now almost
safe to say that the bulk of modern fiction is
written by women. Acting is the only art
in which women have scored a greater suc-
cess ; in all the other arts they are far
behind their male rivals. What is the
reason for the comparative success of women
in literature, especially prose literature?
Women “go in” for art of all kinds because
it is a vehicle for the expression of the emo-
tions, and most women are highly emo-
tional. And the more directly an art ex-
presses the emotions, the more women exeel
at it. Music pours emotion through a
highly complex and elusive medium; paint-
ing, too, is indirect in its emotional expres-
sion. Hence there are few great women
painters and fewer women composers. Only
the actor and the writer reproduce actual
and specific emotion, through the medium
of words. Acting, the most direct of all
the arts, is the woman’s art pre-eminently—•
the only one in which she. is fully equal to
man. Her next achievement is in prose;
for poetry begins to have something of the
difficulty and complexity of music, and there
is a consequent check on the outpouring of
emotion. It is easier to cast feeling into
prose than into a Spenserian stanza or a
string quartette; hence the vast flood of
frenzied fiction that pours from the women
of to-day: they are expressing their “souls”
through the most direct medium possible in
artistic creation.
All artists, male and female, express their
“souls”; but in art it is not enough to repro-
duce the precise emotions that surge through
me each moment. The creations of the
artist are from the imagination as well as
the heart, and may have little relation to
he course of his life; and though the novel-
,st may be moved to real tears at the suffer-
ings of his hero, the tears are not necessarily
for himself. It is this capacity for imagin-
ing without necessarily sharing feeling that
distinguishes the great man novelist from
the woman. The woman is always her own
heroine. We seldom, in reading the serious
efforts of women writers, escape the sensa-
tion that here we have the authoress herself
dissected before us. Emily Bronte wreaked
her spite on the world in “Wuthering
Heights”; Maggie Tulliver’s struggles and
passions were those of George Eliot her-
self. Great men have put themselves into
their books, notably Tolstoy in “Anna Kare-
nina” ; but seldom in their novels do we find
that persistent note of autobiography tliat
follows us through the works, not only of
the Brontes and others of their time, but of
Sheila Kaye-Smith, Rebecca West and most
of the best women of to-day. Women feel
the emotions they describe in their. books,
directly and personally; or rather, let us
say, their literary method consists in directly
reproducing their own private emotions.
No one will deny that this method
enables them to draw excellent minute
character studies, as in Rebecca West’s
book, “The Judge.” The modern ten-
dency in literature, which is so much
in the direction' of psychological studies,
is consequently ideally suited to the
women novelists. Our writers have now
abandoned plots, and see only the exploits of
their hero’s mind, neglecting those of his
body. Women, whose experiences of life
are so much more limited than those of men,
either write melodrama based on imperfect
knowledge of the world —the Ethel M. Dells
of fiction—or they, too, abandon plots, and
concern themselves wholly with the amazing
activities of their amazing minds. Even when
plots were the fashion, in the days of Dumas
and Dickens, the women did not. excel at com-
plicated stories. It is interesting to notice
how directly the modern psychological method
is foreshadowed in writers like the Brontes
and Georges Sand. Writing at a time when
psycho-analysis was unheard of, they were
nearly as introspective as the best Freudian
of them all: passion, dissected and described,
was always their theme. Their inventive
faculty was great, but it was small in com-
parison with their power of setting down
their emotions. And this may be said of
all women writers; their intensely personal
style, which is their great strength, has great
limitations: it almost precludes extensive
imaginative power. The writings of
women are not as a rule remarkable for
high flights of fancy, but rather for faith-
ful representation of facts, especially emo-
tional facts, within their own experience;
and, as this experience is usually narrow, the
range of most women novelists is small.
Shall we ever have a “Count of Monte
Cristo” or a “Vanity Fair” from the pen
of a woman?
Women are, moreover, too personal ever
to be detached in their writings. No woman
ever looks on at the scene she is creating, as
Hardy docs, as Thackeray does, with half-
cynical, half-sentimental philosophy. The
woman is there in the midst of it all, with
her “soul.” And since almost all intro-
spections are morbid and tragic, most of the
writings of woman are profoundly sad.
The eternal personal, which excludes detach-
ment/seems also to exclude humor. Wit
women have —-Rose Macaulay is witty. But
wit is often malicious; and the humor of
women is nearly all tinged with spite, and
is consequently lacking in the geniality of
the true humorist. There is only one great
woman humorist—one indeed so great that
she might be said to disprove the statement
that women are lacking in humor ; but I do
not think that Jane Austen does disprove it,
and it is certainly true that her humor had
in it a great deal of very typically feminine
malice. .
Will women ever triumph over their disa-
bilities in the practice of the arts? They
have produced almost no music and com-
paratively little painting; fine verse, but
little poetry. But several women novelists
have deserved the rare title of genius. One
of these appeared when women were as yet
not emancipated into the full privileges of
writers. It is the fashion to talk nowadays
as though women were “emancipated” in
every way; but it is a question whether they
are so, or Over will be from the thraldom
of their sex. Women have been endowed
witlr an infinite capacity for experiencing
emotion, and an infinite longing to express
it. They can express it beautifully, as it
comes direct from the heart. But the
magic faculty for distilling emotion, as it
were, and transforming it into something
other than itself, while preserving its
quality of emotion, has been given to them
only in part. The creative instinct is dom-
inant in woman; but Nature, having en-
dowed her with one transcendent means of
satisfying it—no less than the creation of
other human beings—-seems to have decreed
that she shall possess only in a modified
degree the power of creating masterpieces
in art.
ARTHENICE.
Is Formlessness Art?
Louis Esson in “Expressionism in Drama"’
(R.P. 15/3/’23) makes the extraordinary
assertion, “Everybody is tired of the so-
called ‘well-made’ play.”
I call the pronouncement extraordinary
because, although I have been a worker in
theatres in various parts of the world for
a considerable number of years, have seen
hundreds of plays come and go, have played
in many of the best, and for my sins have
been cast in some of the worst, I have never
to this day come across anybody who is tired
of the well-made play. My experience, in-
deed, has been quite the other way.
The actor likes to know that the part he
is called upon to interpret is written by an
author who understands „his business. The
producer is similarly pleased when he real-
ises that he will not have to spend endless
days and nights making the ’script with
which he lias been entrusted presentable.
The audience, when the piece at last reaches
the footlights, lias the comfortable feeling
that it is looking at a work that hangs to-
gether well, runs easily, is straightforward
.in its action, clear in its exposition.
And here let the fact be stressed that a
general audience does not know enough on
the technical side to judge whether the tra-
gedy. comedy or farce it is witnessing is
Well made or no. It is not worried by any
expert knowledge, but it instinctively feels
the effect of good workmanship and is con-
tent, just as, on the other hand, it feels the
effect of bad workmanship and is discomfited
and in the end dissatisfied. It is only, then,
the critical few—writers themselves mostly
—-who recognise the structural cleverness
of a dramatic presentation. It is only they
who, in recent years, have attempted to
depreciate it.
For the life of me I cannot understand
this belittling of the value of the play that
happens to be well constructed. Art, like
everything else, must conform to certain
rules, ancl in the make-believe of stage per-
formances it is, we know, the art which
conceals art that counts most—a rule that
applies no less to the dramatist than to the
actor. We do not preferably live in jerry-
built houses; we like our boots to be made
by someone who knows his job; not know-
ingly do we buy a watch that only at inter-
vals' tells us the correct time. But some of
us, it seems, when it comes to the highly-
specialised task -of making a play, cry out
for formlessness and a. general disregard of
the sane methods of piecing it together.
The best dramatists have never disdained
a popular appeal, and the good dramatist is
he who takes pains to construct liis play so
that it will be understood and admired by
the people who pay their money to be enter-
tained. Is there no art in technique, no
value in the observance of definite ways and
means of gaining the best effect with regard
to a work which to satisfy its creator must
surely satisfy a majority of those for whom
it was written ?
“Expressionism”—a hateful word, any-
how—has never been denied to any writer
who aspires to fame on the playhouse
boards, Louis Esson’s allusions to “dogmatic
formulas” and “arbitrary rules and restric-
tions” notwithstanding. He may select any
theme he likes, he may treat it in any way
he prefers; his dialogife may be poetical,
whimsical, satirical, fantastical or plain
journalese —-there is, in fact, no field for the
exercise of his talent in which lie is so
untrammelled. But he must, in the final
result, at least, show that he lias something
of what is called the “sense” of the theatre;
his work nnffct not be entirely lacking in
proportion, balance- —in other words, crafts-
manship. That is, if he would “hold” his
audience. ,
If, however, the feelings of the audience
are not to be taken into account, if plays
are to be written solely for the delectation
of the long-haired tribe that talks much of
art but never patronises it in sufficient num-
bers to make it pay, well and good. Form-
lessness and studied disrespect for the dra-
matic conventions may appeal to such. But
in that case, why write plays at all? Or,
if the invertebrate, wobbly things must be
written, why bother about appealing to the
judgment of that commoner class that knows
what it likes, but, after all, only wants value
for its money? The cause of art, .1 imagine,
would be better served jby circulating the
work amongst the long-halted ones as a pam-
phlet or a tract. For, to my mind, the most
inartistic spectacle in a theatre is “a beg-
garly array of empty benches.”
No. Tlie “so-called well-made play”—by
which contemptuous expression Louis Esson
seemingly suggests that the well-made play
would be better if it were worse-made; a
queer, argument—is not to be despised. And
it is, I protest, nothing short of suicidal to
inferentially counsel would-be playwrights in
Australia—a country which has yet to make
its mark in dratnatic literature —that the
way to success lies in throwing technique
to the winds.
The stage in Great Britain is only just
recovering from the blighting influence of
the many followers of the iconoclastic Ber-
nard Shaw. They, minus the brilliant Irish-
man’s audacity and devil-may-careishness,
attempted to walk in his footsteps, and many
milk-and-water imitations of the real McKie
found acceptance at managers’ hands. If he
who claimed that he was “better than Shaks-
peare” elected to give his audiences long
speeches in place of action or movement, they
would do the same. If he perversely insisted,
after working up to a certain and inevitable

denouement, on bringing his curtain down
on an anticlimax, why not do likewise V If,
in place of scenes between the various char-
acters defty contrived to carry on the plot
of the play, lie decided on writing a series
of duologues dragging in every subject under
the sun, they would follow his august
example. Evidently the public wanted the
Shavian touch, and were they not as com-
petent as the master to give it? Of course,
they were not! There is, thank goodness,
only one Shaw, as his imitators and the
managers who produced their counterfeit
efforts have found out. But in the mean-
time the harm had been done; the public
had been frightened away from the box-
offices, and it is only now being coaxed back.
What is the result as we see it to-day?
Shaw is a back number, his pinchbeck copy-
ists have been warned off the boards, and the
well-made drama has come into its own
again. The most notable London successes
of the last 12 months have been old pieces
by the veteran Arthur Pinero—his “Second
Mrs. Tanqueray” made a record for a revival
by running for 222 performances. Alfred
Sutro, of “Walls of Jericho” fame, has also
“come back,” and has supplied Marie Lohr m
“The Laughing Lady” with her first real
hit for years. A play by that careful crafts-
man, Rudolf Besier, “Secrets,” produced last
September, has a long career before it.
“Loyalties,” by another old hand, John Gals-
worthy, has only just been taken off after
a year’s run. These facts constitute the best
answer to the statement that “everybody is
tired of the well-made play.”
EARDLEY TURNER.
Easter Literature
At Easter-time the churches set to work
to build a tale and a moral on rather scanty
materials, and on the whole the work is not
done badly. It is like constructing a new
megatliosaurus out of a few old bones, and
scientists do that not at all badly also. To
begin the list of difficulties there is a doubt
as to the language or languages in which the
New Testament was written. It is gener-
ally accepted that the Old Testament was
in Hebrew, and there is no doubt that the
Koran was published in Arabic, a tongue
which has not changed much since the
Koran days; but it has been speculated that
part, at least, of the New Testament was
done in a temporary speech, akin to Lingua
Franca or Pidgin English, mixed together
for everyday use in a country where Hebrew,
Aramaic, Greek and Latin were all current.
Some theorists have suggested that a special
speech was invented to write the New Testa-
ment in, and was used for no other purpose ;
but the hash-tongue seems to have passed
away, if it ever existed. The authors and
compilers of both Testaments were many,
and most of them are mere names —or pqn-
names, or conventional names. Their dates
are only indicated in spots, and the spots
where they wrote are often uncertain. In
this respect the Bible differs from the Koran,
which rather dreary work was dashed off
by a strictly historical, if not wholly desir-
able, character, at or close about a date and
place concerning which there is no dispute,
and was published at or about another
accepted date, in one volume, by one of the
writer’s nine fathers-in-law, who is also
authentic and historical.
Not one of the four authors who wrote the
life of the Saviour professed to have seen
events he described, and concerning which he
sometimes differed so widely from the other
three, and the other three from one another.
Thus Matthew’s pedigree of Joseph traces
his descent from David’s royal son Solomon,
and through all the line of Hebrew kings
from Solomon to the Captivity, while Luke
traces the pedigree through a much longer
line of obscurities, including Naum,
and Maath, to one Nathan, also said to be a
son of David, but hard to locate. The four
apparently wrote very long after the event;
hence the habit of saying that something
remained, or was believed, or continued
“unto this day,” just as it might be re-
marked in 1923 that the Pyramids still exist.
Luke in particular was careful to explain
that he was putting together beliefs and re-
ports which had stood the test of time.
Plainly the early churches were founded be-
fore Paul, the tireless doctrinaire, put pen
to paper, because his letters were addressed
to them. And it is probable that his volumi-
nous writings ended before the biographical
parts of the New Testament were written,
this idea being founded on Paul’s remarkable
lack of any reference to them. If the
churches came first, founded by word of
mouth, and planting and cultivating legends
and traditions as they went along, and if the
theology came next, and the biographical
works came last, built up on the recollections
of the oldest inhabitant’s elderly grandson,
discrepancies were hardly avoidable. It is
a wonder that there should be anything save
discrepancies.
The vocabulary of the day could hardly
but be painfully insufficient. In a time
when there were no printing-presses, no dic-
tionaries, few books of any sort, and a scar-
city of libraries, periodicals and shorthand-
writers, a language was hardly more than
the number of words that an intelligent man
could carry around in his head without re-
freshing his memory. When the spoken
matter was of great importance and the writ-
ten one of small account, a word could be
eked out by inflections and gesticulations to
answer an amazing number of purposes.
This is why the .Tew discourses with his
hands to this day. When the writings passed
to a strange people who know not the proper
inflections and gesticulations the new owners
had to guess the meanings, in .many in-
stances, by the context, if they hadn’t also
to guess the context to begin with. Thus
the same word in the hunger-stricken
vocabulary has been resolved into “wind”
(that which blew down the house on the
sand), “spirit” (sometimes holy and inter-
changeable with “ghost,” arid sometimes de-
moniac and requiring to he cast out) ; also
it represents life, soul, intelligence, breath
and other things. Struggling manfully with
the context at different times and in differ-
ent circumstances, and with different sets of
traditions, recollections and oldest inhabi-
tants to guide them, the ancient writers
went their ancient variable way under many
tribulations.
These early writers were ill-served by
their informants, hampered by their sketchy
vocabulary, and probably none too well
treated by their translators. Still the litera-
ture which they furnished the world survives
in some fashion, though but for its value as
a bone of contention among the sects it
might not survive so well. It is a proof of
wonderful vitality.

From Brown Furrows
The student of the future who wants. to
catch the atmosphere of South Australian
farming life as it was at the beginning of
the century will be able to turn with con-
fidence to Dr. C. H. Souter (“Nil”)- I n
The Mallee iFire and Other Verses (Angus
and Robertson), just published, he has col-
lected many years’ work, which reaches a
fair level of craftsmanship and is beyond
doubt faithful to the soil. All the people
are convincing, and all the simple joys and
sorrows readily to be believed; but the
author never attempts to soar to any great
height of description or to touch any great
depth of feeling. In describing he describes
the things on the surface; in handling emo-
tion he leaves everything to suggestion; and
the general effect is the presentation of a
set of people and conditions that are a little
too dusty-brown from the furrows. The
reader knows almost exactly what they will
do and say before they do and say it; and they
are well nigh as much alike as the clods of
the harrowed paddock. Lawson worked with
the commonest types of the wayside, but
generally contrived to give an inner glimpse
of the emotions of his people, which invested
the most sordid of them with more than a
passing interest. Souter may be truer to
life than Lawson, as far as his handling of
his men and women goes; but it seldom goes
far enough. The manner of the verse
heightens the drab effect. An ordinary
quatrqin of four lines should have two
pairs of rhymes: but here there are_ gener-
ally two lines left rhymeless. It is true
that a very fine simplicity can occasionally
be achieved in this way, but only when the
choice of words is exquisite.
Take as an example the love-sick swain
in the cow country : — ;
They can’t ’elp but to love yer, Maud —
The cows an’ dogs, an’ that;
They can’t ’elp. but to love yer
Not no more’n the Gawd above yer;
An’ I reckon I’m about the same as them!
I knows I ain’t “no earthly,” Maud,
I’ve knowed it all along;
But I just want to be near yer,
An’ to see yer smile, an’ ’ear yer
W’ile yer singin’ ter vers elf an’ milkin’ Gem !
And here is another —for the motive of the
person who loves in vain is very frequent
in the book :—
Oli, Keziah ! sweet Keziah !
There! So ’elp me! I’m a liar
If I knows ’ow many bits my ’eart is torn in !
As I’m sittin’ on the stile,
Lor! I’d die for just one smile,
Wen yer goes to call the cows up in the mornin’!
And a stanza of a very characteristic type:
I wish I’d not. been too shamefaced
To let you know 7 my heart —
To let you see how it w 7 as yours.
And every beat it gave
Was fraught w r ith anguish at the thought
- That we should ever part
And how 7 I hoped it sooner might
Be stilled and in the grave!
Some of the purely agricultural verses have
an appeal that may be missed by the general
reader. Here, for instance, is the last
stanza of “Fallerin’ ” :—
A cove may drill an’ roll an’ reap,
Usin’ the “super - ’ free,
A-choosin’ ’is seed with every care—
But arsk ’im this from me:
If ’is fallarin’s shirked an’ ’is ground ain’t worked,
Wot will the ’arvest be?
Fallerin’ ! Fallerin’!
It don’t look much, don’t fallerin’!
But ’e wrnn’t grow u 7 heat
If that gets ’im beat,
Fallerin’ on the Flat.
That is verse with as direct a purpose as
Virgil’s second Georgic and, as such, should
have appreciation where ploughs are busy.
But perhaps the best thing in the book |s
the piece entitled "Irish Lords.” In this
the smell of the cowyard and the dust
of cultivation are both absent, and there is
an altogether fresher observation of com-
mon things
The clover burr w 7 as two feet high, and the billabongs
were full;
The brolgas danced a minuet, and the world seemed
made of wool;
The nights were never wearisome, and the days were
never slow,
When first w 7 e came to Irish Lords, on the road to
Ivanhoe.
The rime was on the barley-grass as we passed the
homestead rails ;
A Darling jackass piped us in, with his trills and
turns and scales ;
And youth and health and carelessness sat on the
saddle bow —
And Mary lived at Irish Lords, on the road to
Ivanhoe.
On every hand w 7 as loveliness, and the Fates were
fair and kind ;
AVe drank the very w 7 ine of life, and we never looked
behind ;
And Mary! Mary everywhere went flitting to and
fro,
When first we came to Irish Lords, on the road to
Ivanhoe.
The window of her dainty bower, where the golden
banksia grew,
Stared like a dead man’s glazing eye, and the roof
had fallen through.
No violets in her garden bed. And her voice—hushed
long ago!
AVhen last we camped at Irish Lords, on the road
to Ivanhoe.
There is some semi-topical verse in the lat-
ter part of the volume, but it is not up to the
level of the rest.
D. M. W.
Beaumarchais
Beaumarchais has had numerous bio-
graphers —notably his friend and Boswell.
Gudin de la Brenellerie —who are all more
or less apologists or outright worshippers;
but John Rivers, author of the latest Life
(Hutchinson), has none of their effrontery,
and the result is a book that, whilst cor-
recting sundry errors, holds, up the hero as
a haphazard and festive spirit full of the
defects that have given him a special cachet
to posterity. It is strange that, while his
contemporaries, Diderot. Voltaire, Mirabeau,
Danton and the rest, have grown somewhat
dim in the mists of Time, this extraordinary
character should increase in historical sta-
ture and become as astounding a personality
as Casanova and Stendhal. His life was
one long romance of merchant-adventuring,
intrigue, pamphleteering and espionage,
decorated with the favors of Royalties and
pretty ladies, and it is not surprising that
Horace Walpole, Goethe, Catherine the
Great and Maria Theresa, mother of Marie
Antoinette, were all discussing him about
the same time.
Beaumarchais was born with a silver
tongue in his mouth. His readiness of
speech, combined with a consummate daring
in the use of it, brought him a series of
headlong triumphs. His first success was
a tribute to his artful converse. Madame
Franquet, wife of the Clerk-Controller of
the King’s Household, touched by his
sprightly address, called upon him in his
early watch-making days’ and the upshot
of the encounter, in which his intriguing
discourse played the star part, was the com-
mencement of a friendship which, on the
death of her husband, ripened into marriage
and won him notice*at Court. Always Beau-
marchais had a fascination for women. His
good looks and reputation as the most re-
sourceful small-talker 'in an age when wit
was the passport to Society, invested him
with a singular seductiveness, and virtuous
females found themselves acceding to un-
dreamt-of intimacies in the vanity of being
honored with his, insidtops homage. He
was married three times —and the early death
of the first'., two wives' caused unfounded
rumors of his having poisoned them for
sordid commercial reasons—but with all his
acknowledged tenderness to his legitimate
partners, there were other suppliants for his
affections, and, despite his diverse activities,
he distributed caresses outside without feel-
ing overworked. At various periods he was
tremendously involved, but he was so swift
in his amours that someone published the
mot that “poor Beaumarchais never knew
where his next bed would come from.” Only
one woman, a beautiful Creole, whom he
expected to become his second wife, jilted
him for a less favored friend, but this in-
sult was compensated for by the loyalty and
devotion of well-appointed, titled wenches
who revealed to him the full import of
noblesse oblige. One may mention the epi-
sode of the frail Comtesse de la Marinaie.
She was a titbit that even he, a hardened
philanderer, found fresh and enticing. Well,
she had him freed from the Abbaye prison
during the Terror by paying, with a bitter
reluctance that does her some credit, the
same price that Scarpia had demanded of
Tosca.
In a chronicle so eloquent of the man’s
energies in love and commerce only mod-
erate space is devoted to his efforts as a
dramatist. Beaumarchais was pround of
“The. Barber of Seville” and “The Marriage
of Figaro,” both of which owed something
to his experiences in Madrid in the Clavijo
affair, but they never at any time held the
whole of his attention. As he said in one
of his engaging letters, “I divert myself
from business with fine literature, fine music,
and sometimes fine women.” Business was
his preoccupation, but the word covered
every conceivable method of money-making
that a radiant fancy could devise. He nearly
made a fortune by a devious plan for pro-
visioning and arming George Washington in
the U.S. War of Independence. He financed
the Paris Water Scheme, which was to
supply the capital with liquid drawn from
the Seine by a steam pump. He started
the grotesque Philosophic Literary ana Typo-
graphical Society with the express purpose
of issuing the first complete edition of Vol-
taire. His ideas were countless and colossal,
his optimism notorious ; but no degradation
was too deep, no misfortune too stunning, to
distress his valiant soul. Imagine him as
an admitted felon, according to the drastic
laws of the Capet autocracy, insinuating
himself into the regard of Louis XV and de-
parting on a secret mission to suppress a
threatened volume, “Memories d’Une Femme
Publique,” which professed to catalogue the
Pasts of the Royal concubine Dubarry. He
was afterwards to have himself entrusted
with a more mysterious contract for the
extinction of an alleged lampoon on Marie
Antoinette, but there is strong evidence for
suggesting that he fabricated the whole plot
for the purpose of regaining his old posi-
tion in Court circles. Still, \yith all his
escapades, whims, and perversities, lie was
unquestionably a great man who rendered
immeasurable service to the State. His
audacious appeals to the people in witty and
well-chosen pamphlets after the scandalous
Goezmann trial were the first shots at the
regime that was to perish in the tumbrils of
1793. He wasn’t conscious of invok-
ing the Revolution, nor was he # en-
thusiastic about it when it arrived,
but he put the thought of it into
other men’s hearts. He died in 1799 from
apoplexy, in his sleep, and it was found, on
looking through his papers, that he had
acted the Prodigal Father to an army of
Prodigal Sons'. Wasters and ne’er-do-wells,
some of whom had been his enemies, had
fattened on his bounty to the tune of 900,000
francs!
C. R. BRADISH.
A Satchel of Books
Wanderings in the Queensland Bush, by W.
Lavallin Puxley (Allen and Unwin). A good writer
might drop off a lioat, spend a few days in a strange
country and make an interesting book out of it.
But W. L. Puxle.v isn’t a good writer and he hasn’t
the skill to hide the poverty of his personal experi-
ences and impressions. Plainly his “wanderings”
in the “bush” were restricted to a short excursion
or two from Brisbane and probably a couple of
northern ports, ahd his references to the country
farther out are vague and often botli ridiculous and
harmful. A fair sample both of his matter and
of his manner follows: —
“Even in the less arid districts it is necessary to
have a ‘station’ covering many thousands of acres
even to make a bare living. I have seen farmers
carefully transplanting a single plant of grass and
replanting it near water in the hope of saving it
for the future use of their animals.”
How many “animals” were going to fatten on that
“single piant of grass” isn’t mentioned. Geo. Allen
and Unwin ought to be fined 20s. or three days for
giving their honored names to such rubbish.
The Conquest of the New Zealand Alps, by Samuel
Turner (T. Fisher Unwin). Despite the author’s
pre-occupation with the magnificence of his own
daring, this is a very readable book. His record,
beginning in 1912, includes three trips up Mount
Tutoko and the ascent of Mount Cook, the latter
accomplished alone. He tells us that when he
announced his intention of adding to his list the
conquest of great Aorangi, several of the guides asked
him whether he did not place his wife and family
before the glory of the exploit; but he knew what lie
was about, for he had already climbed most of the
Swiss Alpine peaks, rambled over the highest mount-
ains of Siberia (for which he received the gold
medal of the Russian Geographical Society) and
“slept 20,600 feet up Aconcagua.”

After the long night watch——Sunrise!
cAs the glorious sun rises, and night with its dangers and terrors is dispelled, so science thrusts its
searching beams into the murk of ignorance and fills the world ‘with bright hope to the watcher.
ONE-FIFTH part of the air we
breathe is Oxygen—the life-
element, the gas in whose absence
animal existence is impossible.
Science has known how to produce
pure Oxygen and to apply it to the
merciful work of healing and to the
advancement of industrial achievement.
New uses for oxygen are discovered
daily. When the aeronaut soars or
the alpinist laboriously climbs to an
altitude where rarefadion of the atmos-
phere makes life insupportable, he
relies on his flask of oxygen for succor.
In the depths of the sea-—within the
submarine—it plays also its wonderful
part.
To the practitioner of medicine or
surgery it is one of the greatest gifts
of science. When the patient sinks,
and the resources of drug and scalpel
are exhausted, the wonder-gas plucks
the precious life from the brink of the
abyss. When the life lies shuddering
in its last, desperate entrenchment.
Oxygen is the rescuer.
And, to-day, this talismen of science
is produced in Sydney. The doctor
or scientist has a place of instant resort
for supplies of his greatest ally. Won-
derful Oxygen does more than work
only for the salvation of precious lives.
It saves each year myriads of pounds’
worth of metal work (from the
humblest appliance to the most stupend-
ous and majestic) by a healing of
crack and fradure, or a seamless union
of mighty masses. The wastage
prevented here is, though less spedac-
ular, no less wonderful than its merci-
ful service to human life.

Economise in the Engine Plant
by Improving the Engine Stores
When the hard fact of cutting manufacturing costs and working expenses has to
be shouldered by the engineer, he can be assured of obtaining the utmost efficiency
from his plant, and thus reducing the over-all running cost, by insisting that his
supplies are only the most tried and trustworthy—years beyond the experimental
stage; such are the following items:—
ADAMS’ ASBESTOS BOILER
AND PIPE COVERING
—a non-conducting composition for effectively insulating
Boilers, Steam Piping, Engine Cylinders and all Steam-
heated appliances. Made entirely in our own factory
from highest-quality asbestos produced. Guaranteed an
absolute non-conductor of heat or cold. Adams’
Asbestos Boiler Covering is used extensively in the largest
power plants in Australia; also by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Railways, Sydney Municipal Council, and Lever
Bros., etc. Our staff of experienced laggers is at your
service, and if necessary we will submit our quotation
for both material and labor.
STOPSKAL BOILER COMPOUND
—the guaranteed remedy and preventive of Scale, Oil,
Grease and Pitting or Corrosion in Steam Boilers. Stop-
skal means an all-time full-power output from Boilers—
no laying off; Fuel Bills cut 10 per cent.
SAVES FUEL, as it keeps all sediment off the plates
and tubes. •
SAVES REPAIRS, because Stopskal protects the boiler
with a glazed surface.
Stopskal does not contain acid, caustic soda, arsenic,
malt, eucalyptus, phosphorus or potash.
Price 2/6 per lb. (lib. makes 1 gallon of Stopskal boiler fluid).
“LION” BRAND ENGINE PACKING.
Recognised by engineers the world oyer as the best and
most reliable packing that has ever been produced. For
most classes of engineering where ordinary packing is
unsuitable or otherwise unreliable, “Lion” Brand has
never failed to give the highest satisfaction. It reduces
friction to a minimum, its durability is remarkable,; and
it keeps the gland perfectly tight even under the most
unfavorable conditions. “Lion” Brand Packing has
been adopted and used with complete satisfaction
by the Government Railways and Tramways, and leading Steamship g
Companies. The “Lion” Brand Packings include block packing,’'*
expanding packing and automatic pump packing. r.-T' ,
ADAMSOLINE GEAR COMPOUND
(A Specialty for the Motorist)
is truly unrivalled in its work of checking noisy gears
and reducing wear of gear-teeth to a minimum. It cannot
be squeezed out from the gear-teeth. It adheres with a
uniform coating and without the “tackiness” customary
with ordinary lubricants. Adamsoline is equally effective
in the differential, as cen-
trifugal force cannot
throw it from the pinion
or crown wheel teeth.
Sold by all Good Garages
or direct from us.
“HUILE-D” MOTOR CYLINDER OIL
(A Specialty for the Motorist).
“Huile-D” Motor Cylinder Oil has been unsurpassed for
more than 20 years for successfully preventing friction and
heat, and assuring a perfect flow of engine power at all
times. Another advantage of “Huile-D” is its unusually
high “flash-point,” enabling it to withstand terrific heat
without carbonising, as well as making it particularly
suitable for working under forced feed. Truly the correct
lubrication for engines susceptible to sooting plugs or
carbon. Sold by all Good Garages, or direct from us.
ADAMITE ASBESTOS PACKING
—the Packing that is Positive—for safer joints in Pipes,
Flanges, Cylinders, Covers, Valves, Boiler Joints, etc.,
and where either steam, gas, water or compressed air is
used; also a most efficient jointing for Motor Cylinder
Heads. Adamite is entirely different and superior to any
rubber-sheet packing. Its foundation is of genuine
asbestos, enabling it to withstand the highest temperatures
without charring or burning. Being highly compressed
it safely withstands steam pressures up to 9001 b. per sq.
inch, and when properly packed it cannot blow out,
neither will it expand with pressure.
ANTI-FRICTION BEARING METALS.
Our stocks include only the highest-grade Anti-Friction
White Metals —a complete series to cover all machinery
requirements—-produced from the world’s best virgin
metals. “M.U.” Brand at 1/3 and 1/6 per lb., “Glacier”
Brand at 1/6 per lb., and O.T.L. Brand (in 5 grades,
from 4/- to Bd. per lb.) are three highly satisfactory
brands. We especially re-
commend “M.U.” Brand
Bearing Metals for all
high-speed engine s—
steam or internal combus-
tion—where only a metal
of the highest quality is
required.
THE EMPRESS HIGH-PRESSURE
LUBRICATING SYSTEM
(A Specialty for the Motorist)
is the latest practical system for quickly lubricating the
more inaccessible parts of trucks and motor-car chassis
by means of a high-pressure gun, which is operated by
only one hand and which effectively handles all grades
of grease and oil. It is convenient to handle, simple to
operate, and both cleans and lubricates in the one
operation. The Gun is of simple yet sturdy construction,
enabling it to function perfectly under long and hard
service.
With the “Empress” you do the lubricating job better
and in less time than with any other system.

The Swimmers.
Out where the salmon shimmers,
Showing a silver side,
Gaily the brown young swimmers
Cleave through the mak.ng tide;
Now in the hollows hidden,
Now on the crests they show,
Breasting the fierce sea-surges
Arm over arm they go.
Grace in their every motion,
Body and limb agleam,
Less of the land than the ocean,
Graceful and lithe they seem;
Foam-walls upon them rushing,
White as a hound’s white tooth.
Forward they forge, the swimmers,
Strong with the strength of youth.
Now in the green sea hollows
Hidden a space they lie;
Now, like the swift rock-swallows,
Back to the shore they fly;
Each on a white sea-stallion,
I’rone on his flying mane,
Splendid and bronzed they hurtle
Back to the beach again.

The roses that first broke their buds for

But thick upon the rafters, drearily,
The dead bones of my dreams swing to and

O silent room of my lost childish hopes,
Far off I keep you hid, so none may hear
My stealthy feet steal through the gloam-

What though I leave upon the step a tear?
Back past that dark door where no light

Seven magpies have I found in between the
barley sheaves,
Seven magpies like a shadow crossed the
poplar’s yellow leaves,
Seven magpies in the hollow where the
brambles crowd the leas,
Knitting with their thorny fingers olive
stockings for the trees:
Seven magpies—was I dreaming, drugged
with spice of afternoon,
When I saw their black wings flitting o’er
the golden harvest moon?
And a ghostly light was playing in the
stubble here and there,
While the glistening grain-stook s quivered
to the gambollings of a hare!
When the grass was wet this morning with
the weavings of the dew,
From the glade among the oak-trees seven
birds across it flew !
Now I find the secret pathway lifted to the
larch-ringed hill,
Winding like a dappled ribbon —-and the
wings are with me still!
Noon ! A drowse of scented sunshine soaked
in resins of the pine;
Sable feet of seven magpies keep a dancing
march with mine;
And when violet-vestured evening looks
athwart the darking zone,
Will the witch’s seven servants set their
measure to my own,
Till, when pallid stars are peering at the
chinks of Heaven’s door,
I shall see a ruby signal flashing on the val-
ley’s floor,
And the shadow rising, falling, of the black
cat by the fire,
Till the cavern in the mountain woos me as
a heart’s desire V
Be she old and worn and wizened, with her
scant locks snaky-grey,
And her withered breasts forgetting all the
lovers of her day,
Then I shall go knwHng downward to the
safety of the plain,
Knowing there be maids more comely where
a man mav k : =s again.
But if she be small and subtle, with a face
moon-pale and fair.
Twisting scarlet rowan-berries in the storm-
elouds of her hair,
With a mocking mouth and dewy, and a firm
breast, almond-white,
Then the Curse of Seven Magpies shall be
on me like a blight!
QUEENSLAND.

WANTED: A BEAD.
In his speech on “National safety” at the
United Service Club in Sydney, the Prime
Minister was at some pains to deny that his
Ministry was “imbued with militaristic
ideas.” To challenge what has never been
seriously charged, to rebut an obvious absur-
dity, is one of the commonest tricks of politi-
cal dialectics; but it is disappointing to find
a new figure in the political arena, whose
chief asset is his reputation for honesty, re-
sorting to it. The Bruce-Page Ministry has
so far not Only done nothing for defence, it
has refrained from so much as discussing
defence, except in those warily non-com-
mittal platitudes which its chief unloaded
on the members of the United Service Club
during Easter week. Yet never was a clear
expression of opinion more urgently needed.
It is 60 years now since Britain, through
the House* of Commons, first called on Aus-
tralia to “assist in its own external de-
fence.” The miserable subsidy which was
offered in 18S7, and accepted in a spirit of
protest (“Australia’s contribution,” said one
distinguished admiral, “barely pays for the
squadron’s rum”), constituted our belated
response. After the Boer War, Chamber-
lain put the United Kingdom’s point of
view in an ad misericordiam appeal: —
The wearv Titan staggers under the too-vast orb
of its fate/ We think it time that our children
should help us to support it.
With hearty protestations of Empire loyalty,
and much waving of Union Jacks, the child-
ren unanimously declined to give any addi-
tional help whatever. The R.A.N. was the
first serviceable contribution made by any
dominion to its own sea-defence, and hence
to the sea-defence of the Empire; and it
was fiercely opposed by those who might
have been expected to approve of it, as well as
by its inevitable enemies, the pacifists and
communists. The old Tory hatred of an Aus-
tralian Navy, the old yearning for a hired
one, is with us still.
When an island continent, with close on
£200,000,000 worth of overseas trade to pro-
tect, talks of defence it means “external
defence.” In that respect our position is
exactly the same as Britain’s: Australian
defence is naval defence. Why does the
Bruce-Page Ministry not say so? Two sorts
of naval defence are open to us. One is the
old subsidy system beloved of a certain cla s
of illiterate Australian capitalist, on the
ground, chiefly, that whatever is cheapest is
best. But Britain will never supply another
squadron at £126,000 per annum; not even
one of those squadrons of obsolete sh ps that
were stationed here before the R.A.N. came
into existence. If the orb of the United
Kingdom’s fate was too vast to be sustained
without help in 1902, what an intolerable
burden it must represent to-day, with a
debt to the U.S. alone of 851 millions to be
paid off, and with 100 millions to be found
this year for unemployment doles! Our fair
share of the Imperial defence bill, calculated
on a trade and population basis, three years
ago was 7.74 per cent, of the whole. Even
allowing for the heroic retrenchment which
Britain has effected since the Jellicoe report
was presented, and for any further retrench-
ment, it is impossible that our contribution
should be below £4,000,000 per annum. Mr.
Bruce, as a practical business man, must
know that no country in the world, and least
of all such a nationally self-conscious one
as Australia, would consent to be taxed to
that extent for a fleet which, while provid-
ing day by day security, gave neither sea-
training to the nation’s sons as such, nor
skill and experience in the manufacture of
guns, mountings and munitions. Why does
he not say so, and close the mouths of the
reactionaries of Nationalism out of hand?
The other sort of naval defence which is open
to us—the only sort, as a matter of practical
statesmanship—consists of an Australian
fleet, organised and trained as the A.I.F.
was, to fight in co-operation with Britain
and with the other dominions. That this ideal
could be achieved without derogating from
the efficiency of the Imperial machine was
demonstrated on sea, as strikingly as it was
on land, during the World War. Some mat-
erial advantages that Australia would derive
from putting its £4,000,000 per annum into
a local fleet would be the opportunity of
offering Australian lads a career in their
own navy; the likelihood, as the years went
on, that more and more shipbuilding-yards,
engineering-shops and munition-factories
would spring up locally; and the reflection
that posterity would be handed an Austra-
lian defence engine in working order instead
of the liability to pay the hire of an Eng-
lish one. Mr. Bruce knows all these things.
They are the stock arguments of every R.N.
officer who was in action with a unit of the
R.A.N. during the World War. Why does
he not say them?
* * * *
It may be argued that the details of the
Imperial defence policy have yet to be dis-
closed. But it is a fact that the foundation
of that policy is still sea-power; and the
recent decision to spend £11,000,000 at Sin-
gapore and station a strong British fleet
there permanently is sufficient proof of the
importance of the Pacific in the new scheme
of things. A definite statement by the Aus-
tralian Government that the Commonwealth
was willing to co-operate in any Pacific de-
fence plan based on Singapore could not
fail to be acceptable to the Admiralty. In
fact, only last month the First Lord (Mr.
Amery) dropped a strong hint in the House
of Commons that the Imperial Government
was awaiting such an offer. It has been
argued, and by none more loudly than those
who have lived politically on Imperialism
for years, that Australia cannot afford to ray
adequately for its external defence. This
is only another way of saying that Britain,
which is raising in personal taxation £2 to
every £1 raised by Australia, should under-
take the obligations of defending our trade,
our freedom and our racial purity for us—
a proposition that should be revolting to any
self-respecting citizen of the Commonwealth,
and that will certainly be revolting to the
average Britisher. It is the Prime Minister’s
duty, instead of complaining that unspecified
critics have accused his Government of mili-
tarism, to stress such salutary truths as
these. The effect of his disclosed sensitive-
ness in respect of the alleged charge of mili-
tarism must be to induce the I.W.W. breth-
ren to raise the anti-defence cry with fresh
confidence and vigor; and the effect of his
silence on the subject of the R.A.N.’s future
must lie to encourage ignorant and reaction-
ary Nationalists to renew their efforts to
kill the Australian Navy, even if its depar-
ture leaves the Commonwealth wholly un-
defended. What the country needs at the
present juncture, and more particularly on
the defence issue, is a lead. Mr. Bruce put
it admirably at another Eastertide function:
You need the restoration of confidence in your
own people, and of the confidence of the world. You
will do that only if you get a strong Government
w'hich marks out its own line and carries it through.
When is his Government going to mark out
a defence line and follow it?
The “BIG SCHEME” DISEASE.
The Northern Territory, which is every-
body’s dog, is being made the text for another
of those great “schemes” which aim at
borrowing all the money in the world right
off, and then doing everything immediately.
There have been many of them since
the habit of raising £45.000,000 per annum
by loan set in and destroyed the Aus-
tralian sense of proportion. The Million
Farms project was a vision of the kind.
Premier Fult.er went off to Europe, leaving
behind him a sketch of how to resume
38,000,000 acres of N. S. Wales, and put
on them 38,000 children of misfortune.
Sundry sanguine persons were suddenly
moved by observing that the Victorian irri-
gat’on settlement of Mildurn. after 35 years
of patient toil, had some 15,000 acres under
intense culture and was doing well. So it
was proposed to borrow blankteen millions,
and make a 200.000-acre Mildura on the
N.S.W. side of the Murray with Govern-
ment-stroke labor, and do it right away. The
cutting up of the whole dry Western
Division, where 10,000 acres isn’t a living
area, tue sheep and cattle being first driven
into the .sea or somewhere to make room
for small settlers, was seriously mooted.
When Dooley was running his little jig in
the Ma State, he and his Ministers had a
plan for "resuming” and “settling” almost
everything. Either these wonderful devices
never start, and only serve to waste time
and divert attention from plain, simple
work, or else they make a beginning, and
then fall with a crash over their own big
feet, and leave ruins lying about. The new-
est Northern Territory project is the work
of a ret.red Major-General of the Australian
army. The moving force is to be the North-
ern Australian White Settlement Associa-
tion, and the amount to be put into the big
bubbly venture is mentioned as £15,000,060,
w.th another £10,000,000 later on. It is
part of the scheme, as reported, that the
Commonwealth should guarantee the interest
on tins money, so it would really owe the
lot, though the pleasant, circuitous way of
putting the thing might divert attention for
a while. The difference between this and any
other loan device is apparently to be that
the Government would not have the satisfac-
tion of losing its money itself, but would
entrust the work to men, more or less out-
side its control, their ability and probity be-
ing guaranteed by themseives and oiners.
In fact, the scheme is Repatriation on a
large scale, with all the possible new draw-
backs and unimprovements. Yet influential
papers begin to give it space, and it is the
latest red herring to be drawn across the
N.T. trail.
* * * *
The plan begins, as all the old plans have
done, by treating the Territory as, of neces-
sity, an isolated colony, like the one on Pit-
cairn Island in olden times, or the one the
Scots set up on Darien in the t me of
William 111. —in fact, as a wild, adventu-
rous thing out of a boys’ penny shocker.
There are to be 100,000 “settlers,'’ brought
here from England, by instalments spread
over a number of years, and dry-nursed on
baby food and tracts sent out from the head
pioneering office. To begin with, as the S.
M. Herald put it (28/3/’23) :
The Association proposes to proceed on the lines
of enrolling first as pioneers, subsequently to be
installed as free settlers, companies of young unmar-
ried men, who will volunteer to give their labor for
three years in return for benefits assured at the end
of that period. During the three years they will
receive rations, clothing and housing free, also 3s.
per diem pocket money. At the end of the three
years each will receive, unencumbered, 100 to 150
acres of freehold agricultural land, prepared for sow-
ing, with seed and sustenance for the first year, and
a house fitted with every modern convenience.
That is how the young N. Territory plaster
saint is to be picked in England and shot
straight into the tropics (for the Associa-
tion, being that sort of stereotyped party,
proposes to begin its work at the north end
because it is the wrong end), there to in-
augurate his wild career. There are, as the
show develops, to be “community settle-
ments,” including especially coastal and
river settlements in the most humid section
of the country, and the Association is to
“treat and market” crops and sundries on
the best principles—or, at least, the best it
knows. In short, all hardship, initiative
and excitement are to be cut out, and life is
to be such a sheltered arrangement that, if
the Association should stop short from any
cause, no large baby in the land would know
what to do with himself. The place is to
be an artificial production, combining on
a generous scale the features of Canberra,
Daceyville, New-Australia-in-Paraguay, and,
in its early stages, those of the settlements of
the Essenes, who were also celibates. Even
if the Association lasted, and even if the
good unmarried pioneer young man stayed
on, he might not get his 100 or 150 acres
“with every modern convenience.” He
might get, instead, a medical certificate
about some of the things which may happen
to plaster saints when they get into the
habit of seeking female society in aboriginal
camps for want of any other sort.
* * * *
The scheme includes the resumption of
work in a small way on the transcontinental
railway from the north end. That implies
postponing the time when any part of the
Territory will have direct communication by
rail with any other State, whereas by start-
ing work from the south end the southern
and coolest part of the country might be
made accessible in not so very many months.
It means leaving the whole area six weeks
or more removed from the seat of Govern-
ment and from southern progress, when the
distance should be more like four days. For
some years the Territory has been dominated
by Bolsheviks from North Queensland —the
kind who made, in their own State, the
Townsville riots and who greeted returned
soldiers with curses and expectoration, and
who, in the Territory, suppressed the
shipping industry, chased a local Adminis-
tration off the premises, wrecked the meat
industry, and on one memorable occasion
exacted £7OO from the Government for the
work of removing a tree. A policy of rail-
way-building from the south, as the first
essential of settlement, would make Adelaide
and Melbourne the Territory’s nearest neigh-
bors. By building from the tropical end
Queensland would remain the ruling influ-
ence and the only accessible neighbor till
the last spike of the line was driven some
time in the dim future; and it would come
over the border in force to see how the dis-
tribution of the £25,000,000 was getting on,
and to explain to the imported plaster saints
that their three years’ agreement was akin
to slavery.
* / # * *
The Federal property doesn’t want the
aid of benevolent financial giants in Eng-
land. It doesn’t want great “schemes” ; in
fact, by simply following commonplace busi-
ness methods such as have been adopted in
a thousand other places it could get along
without “schemes” of any sort. And it could
d : spense with £20,000,000 of the proposed
£25 000.000, and be better for the lack of it.
A 4ft. 81in. line could be put through from
the south with the Federal surplus, the
money that has hitherto been lost by build-
ing £400,000 ships for £1,200,000, the baby-
bonus money, and some odds and ends. Then
land could be sold in moderate areas along
the route to the ordinary type of settler
who doesn’t demand to be furn'shed right
off with “power, light, water and sewerage,
and every modern convenience,” as specified
in the Association’s plan. -And better rents
might then be also obtained for leaseholds of
reasonable size. Queensland gathers in aoout
£1,600,000 per annum of land revenue, so
its tropical neighbor should be able to raise
a trifle m the same way for further improve-
ments. But all that hangs on tne railway.
And even before the opening of the Sydney-
Parramatta railway in 1855 accessibility was
recognised as a desirable thing; m fact, an
essential thing.
THE FAIRLY SANE AND THE
WHOLLY MAD.
Queensland has 290,430 more sq. miles of
land than South Aus., and, what is of
greater importance, it has 164,434 more sq.
miles with a rainfall of 30in. per annum and
upwards. It has long rivers, w r hich S.A.
doesn’t possess. It has rich deposits of tin
and coal, whereas S.A. is bare of both. It
has long been a great producer of gold, while
S.A. is, in ordinary years, the poorest gold
supplier among the States. And it was far
the richest copper-producer in the Common-
wealth before it closed its mines as a protest
against “capitalism,” while S.A. was never
more than ordinary. In these circumstances
Queensland ought to be a prosperous giant
compared with South Aus. How the two
actually compare the following figures show
(they are taken from the Commonwealth
“Quarterly Summary” for December, 1922,
and from the preceding annual volume where
later figures are not available) :
Queensland S. Australia

The Federal tax returns, being uniform, are
a fair test of relative prosperity. In five
out of the six cases where the "Year Book”
sets out the States’ uniform-tax contribu-
tions separately, latest figures show that the
smaller and poorer place with 502,000 people
pays more into the common fund than
its big neighbor with 770,000 people—in pro-
portion to population very much more.
Then the scene changes, and the financial
geologist comes on a stratum of figures in
which the big and naturally rich State has a
decided lead over the small poor one:—
Queensland. S. Australia.
State taxes per
head (1921) .. £4 17 11 £3 6 0
State debt per head
(net) . . . . 108 11 1 105 3 8

Unemployed per 1000
unionists(3l/12/’22) 124 33
But it is not the sort of lead that any State
wants to have.
As regards manufactures Theodore Land,
with almost unlimited coal- and water-power,
should beat the one State which has neither
out of sight, also out of human knowledge.
And it really has a distinct lead in gross
figures. But in 1921 (the tables for 1922
in the “Quarterly Summary” are not com-
plete) Queensland was behind, in proportion
to population, both as regards the number
of hands employed and the amount of wages
paid. And it is interesting to note, seeing
that Theodore and Co. specialise, with huge
taxes and huge loans, in being wage-raisers
and friends of the toiler, that S. Australia
has paid better average wages to its artisans
in every year save one of the Queensland
Labor regime. The Federal Statistician fur-
nishes these calculations: —
Wages of Factory Hands for Year.
Queensland. S. Australia.
1915 £lO4 4 2 £lll 10 10
1916 . . . . . . 108 2 7 111 10 10

1920 135 17 2 141 12 7
1921 161 2 4 166 19 2
It isn’t possible to compare the figures of the
two States for 1922, those of S.A. not hav-
ing arrived yet, but Queensland employed
fewer factory-hands then than in 1921. which
was a very rare distinction indeed. Queens-
land ranked fourth on the paysheet in 1921.
its annual factory-wage being less than that
of N. S. Wales, Westralia or S. Australia,
and likewise below the Commonwealth
average.
Piteous tales have been told about a base
conspiracy of capitalists to stop Queensland’s
lOU. Yet in that respect Queensland had
nothing to lament about. Between June,
1916, and June, 1922, which covered the
whole period of alleged loan stoppage, the
six States contrived to add to their net debts
per inhabitant these amounts: —

If that was a loan stoppage it is difficult to
say what a loan acceleration would have
been.
South Aus. has had three Labor Gov-
ernments ; but they were sane, or, at any
rate, moderately sane, and the party behind
them never pushed them into such mad
money-wasting and credit-wrecking schemes
as Ryan and Theodore in Queensland have
carried through. In any case, it is six
years since S. Aus. had the last of them.
Few people question the personal ability of
Theodore or his dead predecessor Ryan.
But their personal qualities have been a
curse instead of a blessing to the unfortunate
State upon which they have imposed them-
selves. With less capable and adroit men
Queensland would long since have realised
the appalling mess which their policies were
making of it. The time has come for the
North to take its eyes off the men and con-
sider the results of their administration; and
no better test can be applied than this com-
parison of what rich Queensland has d-ne
under Theodore and poor South Aus. has
done under the sort of government that
Theodore’s political opponents offer.


CRIME AND THE DOCTOR.
In theory our present method of dealing
with delinquents has a twofold object—
punishment and reformation. In practice
it is doubtful whether the first is always
justifiable, and the second very often at-
tained. The aim of reformation should be
to make a person who has offended against
social laws more desirous of obeying them.
But it cannot be seriously claimed that im-
prisonment usually has this effect. Is not a
young delinquent likely to meet in prison
with greater criminals than himself and be
infected with their villainy? And on re-
gaining Ins freedom is he not less fitted to
cope with his environment than formerly, his
self-confidence and self-respect having been
diminished? His experience will, moreover,
make it less easy for him to obtain employ-
ment, so that he returns to the same condi-
tions which caused his original fall, with his
power to contend against them impaired.
If he has no sense of shame he merely occu-
pies during his term the position of a guest
kept at the expense of the community, which
suggests that the latter is cutting off its nose
to spite its face. Besides, he often has depend-
ing on him innocent persons who are com-
pelled to suffer because their breadwinner
iias been removed, and by thus injuring them
the community injures itself.
At first sight it would appear that heavy
punishment would have the effect, through
fear, of preventing crime. But history
proves the fallacy of this. The point was
well- argued long ago in More’s “Utopia.”
Nearer our own day the convicts at Norfolk
Island gave much less trouble to the authori-
ties when a humane regime replaced a brutal
one. A little over a century ago there were
more than 200 offences for which a man
could be hanged; there are now very few,
yet no one can say that serious and, par-
ticularly, violent crime has increased.
Few normal people, if they analysed their
feelings, would find that it was the fear of
imprisonment that hindered them from, say,
stealing. This being so, the punishment of
imprisonment is no longer justifiable as a
panacea for the prevention of crime, though
it may be effective in some cases. That of
dogging is still less so. A child recognises
instinctively the right of his father to whip
him if he is naughty, and the adult that of
the surgeon to hurt him in order to cure a
disease. But a man condemned to a judi-
cial flogging feels nothing but hatred against
his persecutors. This may poison his whole
life. In a recent Tasmanian case a boy who
had been whipped in a reformatory waited
after his discharge until he grew up and then
violently assaulted the man who had flogged
him. For this offence he was sent to prison,
thereby completing the vicious circle. Dr.
Devon, the experienced medical officer to the
Glasgow prisons, declares that, if you flog
a man because he is a brute, you only
thereby make him more brutal, and at the
same time you probably turn into another
brute the man appointed to use the lash.
The fear of a flogging no doubt has the effect
of making the offender take more pains not
to be found out, and it may even drive him
to murder, the more effectually to cover his
tracks. Neither does the fear of capital
punishment, prevent murder, which is so
often an impulsive crime. There are cer-
tainly not more murders committed in the
States that have abolished this penalty than
in those that still retain it. And the carry-
ing out of this punishment has a bad effect
on all concerned with it. After the hang-
ing of Carpenter at Hobart recently, three
of the gaol officials were so mentally shocked
that they were unable to resume their duties
for some weeks.
What is needed is a system whereby the
causal antecedents of every crime shall be
diligently sought out. Of 300 delinquent
women examined at a New York court 23
per cent, were found to be mentally defec-
tive and 43 per cent, psychopathic. It is
probable that most of these were very little
morally responsible for their crimes. At
present the law merely asks “Does the
accused know the difference between right
and wrong?” Modern dynamic psychology
has shown that a further question should be
put: “Is he capable of doing the right and
avoiding the wrong?” . The first question
merely deals with the intellectual content of
his mind, and this may be quite normal,
whereas the second concerns emotional and
instinctive forces which may drive him, as
a cyclone drives a man to the edge of a
precipice, in directions which he knows will
bring him to grief.
Men are born with a definite brain-struc-
ture which determines the limitations of
their mental development and beyond which
they cannot be improved. This level of
development varies greatly with different
people, yet society demands the same civil
responsibility from each. Many persons are
brought up in an environment to which they
are totally unable to adapt themselves, and
so fall into the hands of the police. Bodily
disease may cause this lack of adaptation,
but very often it is of psychical origin. For
example, the rebellious attitude of an adult
against social authority is frequently the
direct result of a too-harsh exhibition to-
wards him of parental authority during his
childhood, the repressed emotions of youth
finding outlet in anti-social activity as he
grows up, although he is then quite uncon-
scious of the cause of his bad behavior. The
psychological examination of thousands of
American recruits during the late war
showed that an appallingly large proportion
of the population of that country was en-
dowed with very inferior mental equipment,
and it has been stated that 5 p.c. of the
inhabitants are addicted to drug habits, a
sure symptom of mental degeneracy.
Of course, some offenders will be found
so hopeless that it will be necessary to keep
them under restraint during their whole
lives for the protection of the community.
It will also be necessary to take measures
so that many offenders shall be prevented
from handing on their own bad qualities to
posterity, in order that the number of poten-
tial misfits shall be reduced. But if every
person who. came before the courts was care-
fully examined by psychologists and medical
men, who. could inquire carefully as well
into their antecedents and environment, and
if social workers were trained who could
help them to find their proper position in
society after their cases had been accurately
diagnosed—this work to be correlated with
similar treatment of school children before
they become delinquents—it seems highly
probable that our present huge and unpro-
ductive prison population would be greaty
reduced and a system of dealing with offen-
ders instituted that would be at least logical
and rational, as w T ell as more humane and
much less expensive in the long run: Methods
partly on the lines suggested have been
adopted elsewhere, with the result that the
number of delinquents coming before the
courts for a second offence lias fallen to
about one-fifth of that of similar unfor-
tunates with us.
We should also demand, in connection
with this matter, that every person who
sets up as a candidate for the position of
maker or administrator of criminal laws
should have a knowledge of abnormal psy-
chology. And we should forever abolish
that monstrosity, Bumble, J.P., whose only
qualification to judge his fellows is often
the distinction conferred on him by his pos-
session of the not always socially desirable
qualities that have enabled him to amass
wealth.
ENUL M.D.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Propaganda by Deed.
A practical example of “taking and
holding the means of production by revolu-
tionary action,” which beautiful doctrine was
adopted by the All-Australian Congress of
Trades Unions in 1921, and reaffirmed in
1922, came to light the other day at Kal-
goorlie. The jury system got an advertise-
ment at the same time. Until the black
day when the A.W.U. butted into the min-
ing industry, the Westralian Golden Mi’e
had the most successful miners’ union in
the Commonwealth. Its members were paid
high wages, and their prudent and far-
sighted leaders, notably Jabez Dodd, steered
clear of strikes. But with the xvar and the
A.W.U. a different sort of leadership arrived.
Then an enthusiastic attempt was. made to
hitch the union to the red star of Revolu-
tion, meaning strike, go-slow, the class-war,
dictatorship of the proletariat and (at that
juncture) peace with an unwhipped enemy.
The old hands, who had sworn by the now-
ailing Dodd (nearly all the young miners,
and many of the middle-aged, had gone to
the war), stood it until the conscription
controversy, when the attitude of the
Joiinny-come-latelys got beyond their en-
durance. Thereupon they quietly reformed
their old union, resuscitating for this pur-
pose a branch which the A.W.U. hadn’t
bothered about, and carried on. An effort
was made to squelch them by contesting
their application for registration under the
State Arbitration Act. But the objection
crashed with costs against the A.W.U. It
was then thought that the argument of the
boot would succeed where litigation and in-
timidation by word of mouth had failed.
One morning the members of the new-old
union were attacked singly by an organised
mob, which tried to drive them off the min-
ing leases. Some of them were overpowered,
but others resisted stubbornly, and the
State Government standing by them —it
showed more spirit in this instance than
when it abandoned the Fremantle wharf to
a triumphant horde of coalheavers —their
assailants faded away. One of the ring-
leaders in the riot was a certain A. C.
Callanan, the most notorious goldfields ex-
pounder of the gospel according to Trotsky
and Bill Heywood, of Idaho. A subsequent
exploit, in which Callanan played a lone
hand, was described as follows in the papers
of November 18 :
It was pay day at the Great Boulder mine,- and
about 10 o’clock, when the officials were engaged
in making up the pay, a man wearing a mask and
flourishing a large revolver cried “Hands up!” He ad-
vanced to the table ar.d gathered up the money,
stowing it in a bag which he carried slung over
his shoulders. Then he made off in the direction
of the Horseshoe mine. Constables Diggins and
Lapham, the escort for the Horseshoe mine pay,
gave chase in a motor-car. The man disappeared
among some houses. After a search, Detective Reid
arrested A. C. Callanan. He had a large Colt
revolver fully loaded in his possession, and £O2O
was found secreted between the linoleum lining and
the wall of a room in which he had taken refuge.
Brought to trial on March 22, Callanan ad-
mitted “taking and holding” the plutocratic
oppressor’s money. He did it, he said, “to
cause a hullabaloo,” because he and others
had been persecuted by the Employers’ Fed-
eration. Moreover, if he hadn’t been inter-
rupted he would have gone to the Horse-
shoe mine and taken some more. Looking
pityingly at the incredulous gentleman on
the bench, he explained, “It’s what we call
propaganda by deed.” To which McMillan,
C.J., tartly replied that it was the first time
he had heard of propaganda being dragged
in as a defence, and his recollection of crim-
inal cases went back 41 years. But the
plea must have impressed the jury, for that
sapient body agreed to disagree. Some of it
may have decided that robbery under arms
is not the only form of “propaganda by
deed,” and that jurymen are just as acces-
sible as the capitalistic enemy. Anyhow,
the verdict adds one more count to the swell-
ing indictment of the jury system, as it
exists at present. The case suggests also
that the advocacy of theft as a political and
industrial creed should no longer be classed
as pure idealism, but as plain ruffianism.
In short, that Communism is indistinguish-
able from Crime.
Disrupting the Army.
In an address delivered at Melbourne Town
Hall General Rosenthal urged “leading
men and women to give more of their time
to public affairs.” He certainly practises
what he preaches, being an M.L.A. and a
Sydney city alderman, as well as an office-
holder in various propagandist organisations
of the type of the King and Empire Alli-
ance. The anomalous feature of the busi-
ness is that he is also in charge of a C.M.F.
division. General Ryrie is another who,
while holding a high military command, en-
gages in controversial party polities. One
of the reasons why men such as Rosenthal
and Ryrie got harmonious work out of their
men in Egypt. France and elsewhere was that-
they were careful not to betray partisanship
on "any political, religious or social issue.
No doubt they held the same views then as
they do now, but it would have been a cala-
mitous thing if, in the A.1.F., which con-
tained a huge percentage of labor unionists
and very many Roman Catholics, they had
publicly expressed such views. General
Rosenthal observed further that “public
hfe was at a lower stratum than it had ever
been, and that the R.S.L. members had it in
tlieir power to raise it.” The League mem-
bers, and those who might have been League
members, had it in their power once to do
a lot for the State and for tlieir neglected
and unfortunate comrades. But they allowed
themselves to be sundered by Nationalist poli-
ticians and Labor politicians, Protestant sec-
taries and Catholic sectaries; and at the pre-
sent time the R. S. League has little more
influence than General Rosenthal’s King
and Empire Alliance, which he so nearly suc-
ceeded in affiliating with the League. The
phenomenon provides a needed lesson to those
who control the destinies of the C.M.F. There
is not a brigade, a battalion or even a com-
pany in all Australia that can fail to be
affronted, in respect of at least half of its
personnel, by the ojiinions on politics and
religion that are continually being expressed
by Generals Ryrie and Rosenthal. It may
appear right and salutary to the present De-
fence Minister that the highest military com-
mands should be held by Tory propagandists.
What he apparently fails to see is that, at
the next swing of the pendulum, a Labor
Ministry may be in power, with a Defence
Minister anxious to see the highest military
commands, with all the opportunities they
offer for proselytising work, held by Labor
propagandists. And that way lies the chaos
which is already beginning to disclose itself
in the C.M.F.
Justice—at £lO,OOO a Month.
There came to an end in Sydney last week
the public scandal known as the Myerson
case. The issue, as the Judge remarked in
his summing-up, was “of the simplest nature.”
The foreman of the jury told the Court that
(he only evidence which had really impressed
his colleagues and himself was the tour of
Myerson’s houses. This occupied a couple
of days, so that if litigants of moderate,
means had been concerned the matter should
have ended inside a week. But the lawyers
happened to be dealing on the one hand with
a journal which regards libel suits as pub-
licity investments, and on the other with a
foreigner who has yet to learn that law, like
war, is unprofitable to all but a very few.
So the thing was dragged out by one device
and another, and in truculent defiance of the
protests of the Judge, till it had lasted over
a month and had cost the loser the best part
of £12,000. There are all sorts of objections
on public grounds to this glorification of the
“go-slow” doctrine. But perhaps its most dis-
astrous effect is on the repute of the Bar,
and through the Bar on the prestige of the
courts. If Justice Campbell complained once
that the time of the Court —which is only
another way of saying the money of the tax-
payers—was being “deliberately wasted,” he
complained 20 times. Had a Judge publicly
levelled a charge like that at, say, a civil
servant, the latter’s Department would cer-
tainly not have remained deaf. Yet up to
date the controlling body of the Bar has
given no indications that it knew of any-
thing unusual having occurred in Mr. Jus-
tice Campbell’s court. Admitedly, the Bar
Council has only limited powers, but at least
it can publicly rebuke those who offend
against the ethics of the profession, and such
a rebuke, provided it was couched in
adequate language, might amount to a severe
punishment. But sensitiveness to public
opinion, and to the opinion of the Bench, has
largely gone out of fashion with both
branches of the legal profession in N. S.
Wales. Towards the end of last year a re-
markable scheme was evolved by several pro-
minent solicitors, the outcome of which was
that two ladies were bought out of a divorce
suit behind the Court’s back. The details of
the device were sworn to before the Regis-
trar in Bankruptcy by the gentleman whom
it materially helped to render insolvent; and
they have never been denied. The Law In-
stitute, despite comment in the press and
elsewhere, was as inert on the subject as the
Bar Council has been for several years in
regard to the blackguardism which is prac-
tised by certain advocates. Everyone ap-
pears to be shocked at what is going on ex-
cept those who are where they are to see
that shocking things do not go on. What
is obviously needed, in the circumstances, is
an institution which will guard the guar-
dians. A Litigants’ Protection Society,
pledged to formally draw the attention of the
Full Court to scandalous cases that have
been ignored b.v the Bar Council or Law
Institute, would prove a godsend to many
others beside litigants.' Prominent amongst
them to those barristers and attorneys who
are now being made to suffer in their pockets
as well as in their professional self-respect
by the methods of a few of their colleagues.
: •
Diamond-cutting.
“C.0.M.” speaks in parables:—
The hardest thing in the world is native to Aus-
tralian rocks. The Commonwealth has so far pro-
duced no great diamond field, but the small dia-
monds found in various parts are so hard that the
dust of the greater gems of Africa, India and Brazil
will not cut them. There is no known means by
which they can be shaped into lustrous ornaments
save by the hardness of their own dust. All dia-
monds are cut with the dust of diamonds, because
the world produces nothing else that will make so
much as a seratch on the stones; yet all the other dia-
monds of the world —except a few in a small field
of Borneo —might be cut to pieces by the little
crystals found in Australia, without the latter being
in the least affected. Possibly this is some sort of
compensation for the fact that no large diamond-
mine has yet been opened in the Commonwealth;
possibly it is a statement written deep by nature of
a great philosophic truth which must grip the
minds of Australians before they get much farther
forward on the road.
When Australians entered the Big War much of
their energy was wasted in testing a theory of
Kitchener’s. That theory was that they could only
be made soldiers on the British model, and that
the sand of Egypt was the best material that could
be used for cutting them to the desired shape. Look-
ing back on that period, it is now fair enough to
say that not a single facet was ground on the hardy
Australian material by all the marching and counter-
marching in the desert. As far as Australians were
shaped into soldiers at all—and most of them were
natural soldiers without any shaping—it was done
by the comradeship of other Australians. That did
cut and polish as far as was necessary; and the
results were keen wedges of fighting material which
left a deep impression on the clear military mind
of France.
But the lesson has so far failed to bite into the
intelligences of Australian politicians; nor has it
found any very clear, expression in the press. To
borrow something from Europe or imitate something
from America is still the leading idea. Australian
Socialists, after following the German Marx to the
point of absurdity, began hailing the Russian Lenin
as the Moses of their Exodus; yet. all the time their
real hope lay in Bill of Gympie and Jm of Bathurst,
with the stalwart assistance of Mary of Geelong.
Nor are Labor’s opponents capable of estimating
.matters more truly. The model of England is still
as painfu-lly in their minds as in the days when a
Henry Parr eh could argue that what seemed to
keep Manchester, from destruction must necessarily
be good for the country beyond the Darling. The
talk of Empire and the consideration of many lands
as if they w T ere one in nature and texture have
obscured the fact that Australia is, different —and
harder. All comes back to the same point: we
have been trying to cut the Australian-diamond with
softer material. So it comes about that the problems
which faced the Commonwealth at the start are
largely unsolved to-day, though scores of political
reputations have been lost in the years between.
Until we learn the general principle of the thing
it is perhaps fortunate that no greater diamond-field
has yet been discovered. With more and bigger
gems and wider and deeper problems we must use
stronger and harder material than the dust of other
lands and the sands of a weaker past.
Along the Murray Valley.
Fruitgrowers in the Murray Valley have
their worries these days. One is the pro-
longed summer drought. They are not alone
in that respect, since the same complaint
goes up from all pqints of the compass. For
once in a way the Northern Territory
grazier is suffering along with the farmer
on the Snowy River; the Sydney gardener
as well as the corn-coaxer in the Westralian
wheat belt. But nowhere has there been
less rain than in the arid region where the
hopeful Carruthers wanted to unloose so
many of his Million Farmers. For months
the river at Mildura lias been below summer
level. For weeks it has been hazardous to
irrigate owing to the increasing salinity of
the water —always a source of anxiety in
an abnormally dry season. No doubt those
with well-matured vines and fruit-trees can
carry on without irrigation until the river
rises to normal, but the man who is obliged
to give his block a drench has a feeling that
he is taking a desperate chance. And when
the drought becomes an unpleasant memory
there will remain the haunting fear of over-
production. The Australian market was
over-supplied before the war. Where are
buyers to be found for the produce of the
soldier-growers at Red Cliffs (Vic.), in the
S. Aus. districts and on the N. S. Wales
side? There must be nearly a thousand of
these trusting warriors already, and it is
proposed to settle thousands more regardless
of that all-important factor, the buyer.
Bright hopes are cherished that Britain will
find a way out of the difficulty. That coun-
try is a great consumer of raisins, currants,
apricots and the like—in the latest year for
which records are available, it imported
£60,267,000 worth of fruits, fresh, dried and
preserved—and if it granted the Australian
producer a preference sufficient to enable
him to compete on favorable terms with
California and Smyrna, the ghost of over-
production would be laid. The A.D.F.A. has
found a powerful friend in the London
Times. That paper is impressing on the
Bonap. Law Government that the Murray
valley offers a rich field for British settlers;
but whether the argument will prevail over
the traditional Cobdenism of a country which
learned little from the war and hasn’t for-
gotten much remains to be seen. No one
can travel from Mildura to Blanehetown
without being struck by the fine quality of
the settlers, and if he has any imagination
at all he will take away the feeling that they
are laying the foundations of a splendid
State. But serious problems will have to
be solved before the dream comes true.

How T.B. Is Spread.
“Phthisis”: Why does the N. S. Wales
Health Department continue to align itself
with the forces of ignorance, greed and
monopoly in its treatment of consumptives?
In the last 12 months I have known quite
half-a-dozen sufferers who though able to
support themselves financially could not get
accommodation, not even an empty house.
Being ejected from several boarding-houses
and hotels could hardly have helped them
to live longer, but perhaps they were lucky
to escape dying in the street. The ordinary
hospitals will not take such cases, the Q.V.
homes usually have a waiting list and re-
serve their beds for poorer patients, and in
all N.S.W. there are only three private T.B.
hospitals, with a total of 30 beds. I am in
one of these now, where the fee is £5 ss.
weekly {phis doctor and medicines), yet the
matron is turning cases away every day.
What becomes of them and the hundreds of
others who could pay two, three or four
guineas weekly? All the State does is to
maintain one large sanatorium, which is
full of dying and indigent chronics, and
which every physician does his best to keep
his patients out of. In any case its capacity
is only a few hundred beds when thousands
are needed. Yet when competent nurses ask
for licenses they are refused. The excuse
was recently given that there were too many
licenses on the Mountains already, although
there are only two licensed private T.B. hos-
pitals (20 beds) in the whole district. Yet
almost every Sydney practitioner, immedi-
ately he diagnoses a case of T. 8., orders it
to the Mountains, while many more come
from other States, Maoriland and even
European settlements in Asia. The result
of all this is that there are thousands of
active T.B.’s hiding their trouble and mix-
ing with healthy people without taking the
few simple precautions that would make
them quite harmless. So the disease is
spread. Doctors, too, knowing the social and
business boycott (founded on ignorance) in-
volved, do not report cases as they are
statutorily required to; some do not even
inform the patient what his trouble is, and
the T.B. statistics made public are mislead-
ing. The chaotic condition of the whole
matter is brought out by the appeal made
the other day by the National Association
for the Prevention and Cure of Consump-
tion for funds for the erection of a new dis-
pensary. “The Association’s dispensary at
Hay and Parker streets,” we are told, “treats
yearly about 5000 or 6000 cases, and there is

When the doctor says™ 44 Give up Sugar ”
—use Malted Wheat Extract
If yott are wise, you will give up sugar before
your doctor tells you to, for the excessive use
of cane-sugar is frequently the cause of dia-
betes, high blood pressure, and ether ills.
Instead of sugar, use Malted Wheat Extract,
a Sanitarium Health Food made from cereals
without the aid of chemicals of any sort—a
pure and natural sweet. It is pre-digested
in manufacture, and does not cause fermen-
tation.
Eat Malted Wheat Extract in place of break-
fast marmalade oof honey containing cane
sugar and formic acid. Serve it with Gran-
ose flakes, Granose Biscuits, or with por-
ridge. Use it as a sauce to sweeten steamed
puddings—it tastes as good as it looks, and
is highly beneficial to your health.

argent need for extending the work.” This
means that last year 5000 or 6000 active
consumptives attended the dispensary in the
evening, saw a doctor and next day went
back to work amongst their healthy fellows.
If this loosing of 5000 active cases in the
crowded city is safe, why the objection to
licensing more than 20 private beds on the
Mountains? And why the fuss when a few
T.B. Diggers are allowed outside the hospital
grounds? And what about the thousands
that are not even attending dispensaries?
What’s the Matter with Cocky?
More extracts from a bundle of letters: —
“W.E.”: As to whether the man on the land gets
too much or too little Government assistance I have
no opinion to offer. I don’t know. I’m a Spec,
builder and property-jobber, and, like my brother
parasites, I do good business these days. Much of
the money I handle comes from the country. Like
everyone else, I read of stagnation and loss of
population in country towns and districts; but how
could it be otherwise seeing that money made there
is invested or spent elsewhere? And it’s not only
in regard to investments. The squatter in particular
is notorious for passing the local storekeeper with
his big orders. Being a spec.- as distinguished
from an Empire-builder, I offer no advice as to how
to check this steady flow of capital from the country,
where it is evidently badly needed, to the city,
which might be better without it. I merely state
the fact.
"Saaedi” : “My quarrel with the man on the land,”
said the opulent city agent, “is that he does not
conduct his business on business-like lines.
You get good years quite frequently, when
there is a surplus of both fodder and water, quite
sufficient if conserved to carry you over the bad
years. Do you conserve it as a man in any other
business would do with his surplus? No, you let
the water run away, the grass dry and blow away,
and then, when the inevitable drought happens, your
sheep and cattle die in thousands.” While the logic
of the condemnation seems 0.K., experience tells a
different tale. In no other large industry do such
variations in value of assets occur. I have
known sheep to be worth 30s. per head one
week, and two months afterwards only 155., without
any guarantee that they would be saleable at any
price in another eight weeks’ time. Such antics
result in a natural and necessary conservatism in
finance. Thus the average grazier’s disinclination,
and frequent absolute inability, to embark on the
large outlay that any useful measure of fodder con-
servation involves is partially understandable.
Further, if a stock-raiser at any given time is
lucky enough to hold a sufficient surplus of capital
to make fodder-conservation possible, whatever he
does is only a gamble and not a safeguard. In the
1918 drought we started to hand-feed 50 head of
cattle and 45 head of horses on home-grown hay.
We used 200 tons (average value £6 per ton), all
we had, and then had to shoot the horses, which
were starving and unsaleable. A few of the cattle
survived on scrub. The production of hay, lucerne
or other artificial fodder is difficult and expensive
over most of the pastoral country. The alternative
is natural grasses placed in sheds or pits; but this
has proved very unsatisfactory. Conservation of water
is a bird of different plumage. Artesian or sub-
artesian water is procurable throughout most of the
grazing country of N.S.W., and has proved, so far
at least, a reliable supply ; and thus the water problem
tends towards solution. Some misguided persons,
however, persist in regarding the drought difficulty
as being purely a problem of water conservation; but
the implied theory that stock will live for long on
water alone is quite unsound.
“A.C.S.”: The outburst of the gentleman who has
managed to tolerate 50 years in contact with the
man on the land contains much that is true and
little that can be flatly denied. But it is one-eyed.
Certainly there are loud-voiced slackers on the land,
as there are in every walk of life; but they are a nuis-
ance to their fellow-cockies. The slacker there is tole-
rated because, like every other pest, he is so difficult
to eradicate. He is nursed by inspectors because, left
unwatched, he would be even more of a nuisance than
he is at present. The inspectors exist, not for his
good, but for the safety of his worth-while neighbor
and the good of the community. As to success, it is
won in this sphere of life less than in any other
without “digging in,” and that, too, under conditions
of which few but those who undergo them can realise
the severity. Nor are their efforts always fruitful.
The dweller in districts remote from civilisation must
content himself—or else voice his discontent —with
the plainest of fare, the hardest of toil, and the
fewest possible comforts and relaxations. Should he
require a doctor he must pay anything from about
15 guineas upwards for a single attendance. Should
he visit the dentist it means about £5. He must
pay through the nose for freights and charges. But
it’s all too obvious. Must not the farmer fight for
better roads, cheaper freights, for all that would
make for his individual progress and the general pros-
perity? Would “Half a Century” have him con-
tent with things as they are? There is such a thing
as “divine discontent,” and through discontent, backed
by genuine effort, comes progress.

The Illogicality of Woman.
Whenever the registration of prostitutes is
advocated—in the interests, inter alia, of
women who are not prostitutes-—the “femin-
ists” protest against what they call “dis-
criminatory laws directed at women.” These
same ladies are using their political power
in all the States to hamstring the laws
aimed at V.D. (they object to notification
on the alleged ground that it operates more
drastically against women than men), though
perhaps the greatest of all sufferers from
V.D. are the children of innocent women.
Yet in the matter of laws, however question-
able or archaic, which discriminate in favor
of women, the feminists are silent. Breach
of promise of marriage is a ease in point. In
theory, of course, a man may sue for breach:
in practice, unless he is a fool, he will not
trouble a male jury with a forecUomed olaim
of the sort. The lengths to which women
are prepared to go in this direction, without,
a word of rebuke from their political sis.ers,
was exemplified in Melbourne the other day,
when Lena Gay (35) claimed £5OO from
Isaac Jeames (69). The plaintiff adm tted
that the old gentleman had never so much as
kissed her, and that they had addressed each
other from the beginning to the end of their
romance as “Miss Gay” and “Mr. Jeames,”
while the defendant swore that Miss Gay
had first suggested marriage to him, and
both agreed that, whatever the association
was, and whoever began it, Mr. Jeames had
immediately tried to get out of it. There
was no question here of a trusting maiden
being victimised by a libertine; no question
of lacerated feelings occasioned by the ruth-
less ending of a passionate love affair; no
question even of the purchase of a superflu-
ous trousseau. All the affair amounted to
was that an old gentleman somehow blun-
dered into an agreement to marry, and pre-
sently, recognising there had been a mistake,
JUSTIFYING IT.
“The K.A.N. must be replaced by an Imperial squadron supported partly by Australian money.
The idea of an Australian navy was a mistake, first and last.” —Daily paper.
DR. POLITICIAN: “I don't like the job, that’s flat.”
NURSE HEM-PIRRE: “What are you afraid of, dearie? After you’ve done for him I can
produce evidence to show that he never should have been allowed to live.”
did the sensible thing and ended the farce.
For this slip he was given the option be-
tween paying £5OO (out of a total fortune
of £260) and fighting a lawsuit. Men do
not rail much against the breach laws, and
still less do they conspire politically to nullify
them. Yet in no sense is it desirable that
a reluctant admirer should be dragged to
the altar by threats. In practice an engaged
man who finds that his affections have cooled
practically always prefers to pay, if asked
to do so, or to let a jury fix the damages.
It is one of the community’s many recogni-
tions that the social position of-woman differs
from that of man. And woman shows that
she agrees by taking full advantage of the
discrimination. But that being so, why
should she denv the justice of discriminatory
legislation in other directions? There appears
to be no answer except that the typical poli-
tical woman wants to get everything for her
sex, as a sex, and yield nothing in return.

Half of Port Moresby seems to have writ-
ten to The Bulletin about Capt. Hurley,
his visit to New Guinea, and the noise that
, was made when he returned to Australia, A
sample letter will serve for the lot: —
With the arrival of the last mail from Sydney
official and civilian Papua alike clapped its hands
to its sides and yelled with laughter at Capt.
recital of his recent “explorations” in the
western portion of the Territory. In the rSle of
photographic showman, Hdrlet is second to none,
but the explorer toueh tickles us, so far as his
recent joy-ride is concerned. An explorer is a
traveller in unknown regions, and we of Papua, with
the greatest goodwill in the world, find it difficult
to bestow that distinguished title upon the man who
adventures into country which has been repeatedly
traversed by others. Lake Murray was discovered
by Massey-Baker 10 years ago, and has since been
visited time after time. Kaimari, Maipua, Aramia,
Goaribari and other places are as well known to
official Papua as George-street is to the Sydneysider.
Joe Ryan, Wilfred Beaver, Lyons, Burrows and
, a little army of others have left imperishable marks
on the very part of Papua which is now referred to
as unknown. Ryan and Beaver, having done their
best to kill themselves in the filthy swamps and fever-
haunted quagmires of Australia’s “Golden Heritage,”
ultimately succeeded in doing so diming the late
dust-up in France. Their names and memories are
unhonored and almost unknown save by the very
few who can appreciate the real exploratory work
which they so successfully accomplished. But, then,
they never hit an astonished Australia with flourish
of trumpet and rattle of journalistic drum, and there
was no Lord Mayor to give them civic welcomes;
no Millions Club to kill the fatted calf. But we
who know cannot stand by and silently see them
robbed of the honor that is justly theirs.

“Bill ’o Costs” : The quaint law-reform
commission now sitting in S. Aus. arose out
of the demand for inquiry into judicial go-
slow methods and the practices of long-
winded and bullying advocates. Among other
side-issues, trial by jury has been put on the
carpet. The one educated, non-judicial cham-
pion of this old system is Professor Cole-
man Phillipson. It isn’t likely to be helped
to longer life by his form of support, which
is mainly on the score of its ancient origin
and historic interest. A long string of Judges
have given it their blessing; but all Judges
are biased witnesses on this question, as
one of the most eminent of them, Fitzjames
Stephen, frankly admitted. The system
stands condemned, broadly speaking, for rea-
sons that are always glossed over by its
advocates:—
(1) It passes by the most competent and highly-
trained intelligence available (the Judge) to leave
decision to the least competent and least trained.
(2) It is selected haphazard and the test of fitness
is the capacity to live in a house.
(3) All the best brains of the community are
weeded out by exemptions from service and the rignt
of challenge. (Watch the empanelling of a jury and
see who are rejected.)
(4) It materially lengthens every trial.
(5) It is always the target of the bluff and bogus
emotion of counsel who wouldn’t dream of addressing
the same guff to an intelligent Judge.
(6) Twelve men are often likely to include at
least one not above suspicion of partisanship or cor-
ruption.
If one may hazard a forecast, trial by jury
is likely to get a death-knock in S.A., at
least in civil cases. Experience of recent
trials gives it a push towards the execu-
tioner. In criminal cases the responsibility
which would be cast on the Judge will save
the system—in grave cases, anyway—for
some time to come; but we may see smaller
juries, selected on a more rational basis, with
the right to bring in large-majority verdicts.
Meanwhile the legal chorus appears to chant
something like: —
Let laws and learning, art and commerce snuff,
But save our ancient light to bellow, bounce and
bluff.
“Leges” : “Hair Splitter” (B. 5/3/’23)
drew attention to a case at Ashfieid
(N.S.W.) in which the S.M. dismissed the
information because the prosecution couldn’t
prove that certain persons who had been
supplied with liquor were born in the Solo-
mon Islands, though they had admitted that
they were Solomon Islanders. But I don’t
think “Hair Splitter” was fair to the
S.M. The latter merely followed the deci-
sion of the Supreme Court in the case of
ex parte White, reported in Weekly Notes
27, page 3S. White’s case was on all fours
with the Ashfieid one, and is the law of the
land until reversed or the Act is amended.
It was held in that case that as the prosecu-
tion was a criminal one, the offence must be
strictly proved—a proposition even “Hair
Splitter” will not quarrel with. Magis-
trates must follow the decisions of the higher
courts, whether they agree with them or not;
and the S.M. —judging by some remarks he
made during the course of the argument
with counsel —reluctantly dismissed the in-
formation when White’s case was brought
under his notice.
The latest pronouncement of that inverted
Trotsky, Mussolini, has, anyhow, the
merit of frankness :
The Fascismo has no qualms in declaring itself
anti-Liberal, and will trample underfoot the decom-
posed corpse of Liberty.
Since two Australian State Premiers have
set the seal of their approval on Fascism
and its originator, and since branches of the
organisation are reported to have been
already formed in Australia, it may be as
well to recall some of the things that Liberty
stands for—Liberty, like health, being an
asset which few give thought to while they
have it. We have not known in Australia
yet that form of government in which the
decomposed corpse of Liberty is trampled
on by a dictator of the proletariat. But we
have seen Liberty thrown, bound and kicked
by a dictator of the capitalariat. Under
the diluted Fascism of W. M. Hughes, it
was an offence to write or say anything
about Hughes that he considered should not
be said. Scandalous things were happening
in the A.1.F., but no Australian newspaper
was allowed to mention them. The perpe-
trators of gross military blunders, involving
the lives of thousands, were not punished;
they were rewarded. And civilians made
large fortunes, and, because they held quasi-
military or -naval jobs, were immune from
criticism while doing so. Such is life in
a country where Liberty is even temporarily
down and out.
“Wodgil” : “Even municipal councils have
caught the borrowing infection, and little
bobtailed suburban bodies talk in hundred
thousands.” Precisely; and the worst of it
is that they are encouraged so to talk by
the Big-City policy of the Commonwealth
Bank. That policy, as announced in one of
the inspired articles that broke out in cer-
tain newspapers when the political autocracy
crashed on December 16, is to leave rural
securities to the other banks and to concen-
trate as far as possible on loans to local
institutions. Not concerns like the Tam-
worth (N.S.W.) Shire Council, which re-
cently recorded its “indignation and disgust
at the treatment meted out to our president
by the Commonwealth Bank,” the president
having made a special trip to the head office
on important business and been unable to
see anyone to discuss it with, but the boom-
ing corporations that infest bloated capitals.
Thus the Brisbane • Council was lately re-
ported to have got £1,000,000 from the one-
man bank for “improvements.” It was an-
nounced about the same time that £150,000
would be provided by the benevolent despot
for a bridge across Sydney’s Middle Harbor.
And it is a dull month when the “Common-
wealth” isn’t thanked by some beaming
bumble for the loan that made a lighting
scheme or dirt job possible. Also, land
speculators and estate agents bless its name.
Owing to the high cost of labor and mat-
erials, and the tendency to regard all such
undertakings as unemployed relief works, it
is unlikely that the ratepayers are getting
more than half the value of this easy money.
The bank is sufficiently protected, no doubt.
In case of necessity it can always put the
bailiff in. But the question is whether it is
good for an ill-developed continent to have
a banking autocrat with the outlook and en-
thusiasms of a suburban alderman. A board
of directors would probably have bigger ideas.

WATER WELL-DRILLING MACHINES.
There has never been a time when the problem of adequate and safe water supply
was so much under attention as at present.
For nearly 50 years the Keystone Driller Co. has been in the forefront of manufacturers of
well-drilling machinery.
The Keystone Driller is favorably known throughout the world. They
have excelled in traction machines. These are in great demand because
of the ease and cheapness of transport.
LET US TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THEM.
GUTHRIDGE LIMITED, 10 George Street, Camperdown (City), SYDNEY,
Australasian Agents.
POLITICAL
POINTS
Certain ill-informed people are spreading
the glad news that the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment has offered to drop the Commonwealth
income-tax if the States will forego their
share of the customs and excise revenue—
i.e., 255. a head. Nothing would delight the
two-headed Ministry more, but it is out of
the question. The Commonwealth relies on
its income-tax to pay interest on the war
debt. Last year the collections were
£16,790,000, and the amounts paid to the
States out of customs and excise were 10
millions less. Of course, the Bruce-Pages
might say, “We’ll do away with our income-
tax if you abandon your claim to the 25
bob a head (your legal right to it expired
with the Surplus Revenue Act in 1920), and
guarantee us 10 millions a year.” But con-
sidering the impecunious crowd they have
to deal with they would be quite mad if
they did.
An Easter appeal was made on behalf of
the Domain sleepers of Sydney, said to be a
numerous flock. And no matter how num-
erous they may be it is probable there isn't
a single qualified tradesman among them. It
was recently mentioned in Melbourne that
the Amalgamated Carpenters numbered 2700,
including four apprentices. So, even mak-
ing no allowance for the fact that Australia
requires to double its stock of artisans every
35 years or so, one little State alone will re-
quire to import 2696 carpenters when the
present lot are too old to carp. Per contra ,
if carpenters run to a son apiece, 2696 bright
young Australians are studying the milk-
delivery, parcel-carrying or paper-selling pro-
fessions, with a prospect of rising to be
Domainers later on.
Hitherto it has been only Governments
which have offered loans free of Federal and
State income-tax; now the N.S.W. Savings
Bank does the same thing with its 5i p.c.
Rural Credits loan. This tendency needs
watching; and Federal and State Trea-
surers ought to come to an agreement about
it. In theory the offering of tax-free loans
is bad, because, in effect, such a loan offers
varying rates of interest, the exemption
being worth far more to the rich investor
than to the poor one. But for that very
reason, so long as there are tax-free loans
available, the rich investor will concentrate
on them, so that in practice it has become
difficult to get the rich investor to look at
the other sort. In time, no doubt, the market
price of the tax-free loans will be gradu-
ally forced up; but every additional loan of
that sort makes this more remote and diffi-
cult. A great mistake was made in the first
place in greasing the fat pig; and the mis-
take is being made worse by allowing the
present drift to continue.
The toilers are beginning to find that they
are not all such brothers as they thought
they were. In spite of the class-conscious
froth they have drunk, they even suspect
that some employers and their employees
may have more in common than those em-
ployees and other employees. In the c*al
business, for instance, both miners and
owners are vitally interested in keeping
prices high—so high that tens of thousands
of other employees in coal-consuming indus-
tries can get either no work at all or only-
broken time. And presently, when road-
haulage cuts further into railway traffic and
a few hundred railway men are paid off, they
will begin to wonder whether the go-slow
on construction works, which has piled up
the cost of many railways, isn’t mainly re-
sponsible for their misfortune. Already it
is certainly responsible for thousands of
farm-hands finding it hard to get a job.
No wonder the market-gardener groans
that he is starved while the city worker
swears that he hasn’t a bean left after the
week’s bills are paid. In Victoria there is
one shop to every 53 people—men, women
and infants. That is to say, every dozen or
so households are carrying a shop and its
landlord on their shoulders —and that in-
cludes the great stores with the little ones.
And on top of the stores are thousands of
(mostly unnecessary) delivery carts, and a
horde of barrow-men and hawkers, not to
mention droves of agents and other middle-
men. Dirt, God knows, is cheap enough;
yet under present conditions you couldn’t
retail good country dirt to the suburbs for
much under 2d. per lb.
This is Education Minister Bruntnell’s
description of what he found in Kogarah, a
populous Sydney suburb, with the advantage
of being under the sleepless Ministerial eye:
Ceilings falling in. Doors rotted. Floors nearly
gone. Rats jumping through the crevices on to the
books of the girls while they were studying.
The N.S.W. educational apparatus, like the
main roads, which were also constructed in
a measure out of loans, is worn out. It
rotted to death while the men who should
have taken care of it played round with State
fish-shops and timber-yards and other jokes.
Now it requires, the same as the roads do,
very much more loan money to put it even
NOT USED TO KINDNESS.
Dr. Page, the Federal Treasurer, holds out vague hopes of the Federal income-tax being abolished soon.
THE DONK : “ ’Strewth! Is this a blolce going to he kind to me at last, or ’ave I
been doped?”
partly right. And when it rots again—for
the N.S.W. polit.cian never sticks to one
thing long—it will be decided that another
drink out of the same old bottle is inevitable.
State Statistician Smith, a kindly gentleman
who has never been accused of cruelly mis-
representing a fly, says that N.S.W. had 69
fewer State schools in 1921 than in 1913,
and 73,444 more boys and girls to crowd
into them. Apparently places like that at
Kogarah are only dying, whereas some
became so much worse that they are dead.
Putting a robust and hearty aspect on
things for the election, Premier Theodore
states that Queensland hasn’t the slightest
need to “approach” the London market for
a loan, just as Daniel had no need to ap-
proach the lions, and he didn’t get any money
out of them either. Theodore alleges that
his Government offered, in February,
£1,000,000 worth of loan over the Treasury
counter, just to “test the market,” and “the
market” rushed it inside two months with
£905,140. But why should the news buck
up Queensland, as it is evidently expected
to do? It’s the camel that has to hump the
burden, not the man who loads it.
In the Speck, as elsewhere, high railway
freights and fares are sending traffic on to
the roads, and motor-lorry services are
springing up in all directions. Also, there
is chronic dissatisfaction among the railway-
men. A strong case for inaction having thus
been made out, the Government has appointed
the familiar Royal Commission. At first
the excrescence was to consist of a magis-
trate as chairman, a technical man from
Westralia and a defeated Liberal politician.
But the Labor party objected to the ex-
legislator, and the coldfooted crowd on the
Treasury benches handed the Commission to
the technical gentleman as chairman, a
business man and a cocky. The interest-
ing trio are to suggest methods of economy
and efficiency, to advise on organisation,
maintenance and control, “and to make such
other and further inquiries as they deem
advisable.” That ought to keep things going
for at least two years.
“G. Rich’s” new development of dumping:
Eastralian jam is being dumped into Westralia,
at prices much below those collected from retailers
in Eastern capitals. In February, 126,0001 b. came
across. Jam placed in Vic. at 13s. to 19s. a dozen
is changing hands in the West at 11s. 9d. upwards,
and one parcel of 10,000 cases is said to have lately
fallen among Westralian wholesalers at a shade over
9s. a dozen. With the cut prices overshadowing
their output, Western manufacturers haven’t, much
hope of long surviving the onslaught of the Eastern
jampots. The Interstate Commission might have
had something to say about this new development if
it had been permitted to live. Certainly something
will have to be done to protect the baby industries
of the pioneering parts of Australia from the dumping
practices of old-established sections of the continent.
Stewart, the new Minister for Works and
Railways, is again showing the roving dis-
position that took him to sea in days gone
by. He had hardly warmed the chair in his
department before he was off on a voyage
of discovery to Canberra. Then someone
mentioned that things were rusting in the
dejected naval base in Cockburn Sound
(W.A.), and he immediately scurried over
to personally inspect the waste and get
material for a report to Cabinet. Stewart ha 3
good stuff in him, but the temptation to fly
about is strong when a man’s native rest-
lessness is egging him on.
Unless the Massey Government is thrown
out in the meantime, the M.L. embargo on
German goods will be lifted in September.
In 1913 produce to the value of £687,935
was imported from Hohenzollernland. In
1919, under the restrictions then in force,
the amount was £23; in 1920, £5462; in
1922, £25,741. The merchants are clamoring
for 12 months’ notice in the interest of their
Christmas sales. But if Australian experi-
ence is any criterion they have little to worry
about.
The renewal of the beef subsidy put the
Argus in a hole. Having just castigated
the Tasmanian carbide people for asking for
an increased duty to cope with foreign com-
petition, the Foreign-trade paper couldn’t
give the dead-meat bonus its blessing. So
it contented itself with remarking that the
continuation of the sop to its squatter-
friends was “unpleasant news,” not on the
usual Argus ground that it was "coddling”
a native industry, but because it would pro-
vide ammunition for “the party which seeks
to destroy the present economic structure.”
This is a good jest considering that, where
votes are in question, the party referred to
is as promiscuous a subsidiser as any.
“Tuart” thinks he has a great scheme:—
The Westralian A.N.A. suggests that “hospitals,
asylums and charities” should be financed by lottery
loans, “the Government to get the full benefit of
the money subscribed and the prize-winners to be
paid out of the interest.” But there are obvious
objections to borrowing for the upkeep of hospitals
and asylums, even though $ or f p.c. were deducted
from the prize-money to form a sinking fund. As
soon as one loan was exhausted another would be
necessary, and, hospitals and asylums being perpetual,
like constitutions, the list would eventually stretch to
the crack of doom. But the principle might be
applied in the redemption of the war-gratuity bonds,
which mature in May, 1924. Suppose 1 p.c. were
deducted for amortisation, at least a quarter of a
million p.a. might be available for distribution among
the subscribers. Consider how the thing would appeal
to this nation of punters—“A chance in a quarter of
a million a year and your stake-money intact.”
Maoriland’s P.M.G. is sparring for wind.
Recently his proposal to double telephone
charges stirred the Shivery Isles more than
the earthquake on Christmas Day. Now he
is looking hard at the postal rates. Three
years ago the Department was delivering
letters up to soz. with a penny stamp on
them. In August, 1920, the rate went up
to 2d. and the weight came down to 2oz.
In February this year became the fee
for letters, plus Id. per oz. overweight. Gor-
don Coates’s wail is that the P. and T.
Department is not paying, and if anybody
knows a better way of making it pay than
charging a trifle more for the service he
hasn’t mentioned it. The trouble in these
times is that most people don’t care whether
a public service pays or not. The dishonest
habit of cloaking deficits with loans has
demoralised them.
“Henry Horsecollar”: It is all very good
for N.S.W. Labor-leader Dooley to take on
the Bolshevik “objective” and profess to be
"Red” in order to buy support; but I have
little faith in his color. To illustrate m.y
meaning, I became acquainted with a bril-
liant sort of monkey in India, the animal
having a small, bright-crimson face and a
large bright-blue patch behind. It was
called a red monkey, but the bigger and
more important, if not more interesting, part
of it was blue. Of course, if it wore clothes
like Dooley, people might imagine that its
entire objective was red, as Dooley says his
is ; on the other hand, if Dooley didn’t wear
clothes, like the monkey—but the subject is
becoming complicated.
S’African competition in the wattle-bark
industry prompted the Federal Parliament
to increase the duty on the imported article
from 30s, to £3 per ton. It has had its effect.
Tanners and leather merchants, pinched for
the moment, have started to organise the
wattle-growing business; and free parcels
of seeds have been handed out to schools
throughout Vic. Now all the shire councils in
the State are being communicated with and
urged to plant wattle trees on the sides of
roads, etc. The most suitable sorts for
tanning material are the black and golden
wattles. With favorable conditions —and
they are common enough—the black averages
281 b. of bark at five years, and usually 401 b.
can be stripped from a six to seven years
tree.
It is taking a long time to get the Vic.
Charities Control Board into being. Metro-
politan hospitals have nominated Fred
Knight, the taxpayers’ protector; Donald
Mackinnon, ex-politician; Lockyer, ex-Comp-
troller of Customs; and Dr. I-lurley, a former
head of the Melbourne Hospital professional
staff. The country hospitals’ contingent will
consist of Saltan, of Warrnambool; Glen-
cross (the political lady’s husband) ; Dun-
stan, of the Midlands; and Dr. Thompson,
one of the Castlemaine Foundry family.
Four more have to be chosen by non-hospital
charities, and then will come McPherson’s
brace, making 14 in all. It will be early in
May before R. J. Love, the new Inspector
of Charities, takes the 14 in hand, and that
won’t give McPherson much chance to orate
on his pet board in the Budget speech—if
there is to be any Budget speech for him
this year.

(Did ever you hear of “ringing a grey”?)
I quite forget how it came my way.
Much gain at two-up it might afford,
But I’d scorn to spin it. Why, then, inveigh
At a ballot-box with a sliding board ?
Envoy.
From loaded dice and from doped Tokay,
Or hocussed rum, deliver us, Lord!
But it might be used for a mousetrap, eh ?
The ballot-box with the sliding board.

FREEDOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Premier of Italy has denounced liberty."
—Cable.
Put out the lights and let the curtain fall!
No longer from her old historic home
Shall ordered freedom to the nations call,
Nor manhood kindle from the fires of Rome
The democratic torch of some new day.
In vain did Tarquin fail and Caesar bleed.
The tyrant’s sceptre has a lighter sway
And readier force to match a people’s need
Than all the clamor of the voting throng
That drowns the thought of ages in a cry,
And makes of haggard peace a monstrous wrong,
Where sloth has honor and ambitions die. . . .
Vain words of age that age to age has flung--
Yet freedom lives because the world is young!

Profits have fallen below’ £200,000, and are
less than for any half-year since 1910. In
any other business show’ing such a decline
the management would hasten to explain;
but Denison Miller, who is at present in sole
command of the Commonwealth Bank, is
as silent as any of the steel-bound holding
cos. of the hush-class. This should not be
so; every citizen is part-owner, and has the
right to" know precisely what is happening
in this national banking enterprise, which,
after all, is only a Government department.
The Commonwealth Bank has not issued a
report on its current activities since it
began; its balance-sheets have said less than
those of any proprietary bank. Denison
Miller has missed opportunities no other
Australian banker, and very few else-
where, ever had: without fear or favor, he
has been in the xiosition to discuss current
conditions, and could have performed a public
service by utilising his extensive organisa-
tion and a few pounds of profits to enlighten
the public concerning the numerous little-
understood problems of the money market.
Instead, even his periodic accounts serve up
onlv bare bones, which are certified by Audi-
tor-General Israel as the true skeleton of
the business. This secretiveness is, perhaps,
the most unsatisfactory feature of the Deni-
son Miller control. Only higher officials and
the Auditor-General’s staff get a glimpse of
details. The owners are given no informa-
tion whatever to enable them to decide
whether the enterprise is capably directed.
The Profit and Loss account is confined to
one entry which merely states that the pro-
fits from combined general and savings busi-
ness are so much ; there is no disclosure of
gross profits or of expenses. The fact that
handsome net profits are shown at each
balance is tendered as ample evidence that
the management is all it should be. But if
net earnings are small in relation to gross
earnings—there is no evidence one way or
the other on that point—the magnitude of
net profits at present disclosed may be en-
tirely misleading. The Bulletin would not
be surprised to learn that Commonwealth
Bank costs arc high. Anyway, what banker
less gifted than Denison Miller could not
have shown handsome profits from the excep-
tional opportunities of the war period and
since?
The very meagre information presented in
the published accounts is supplemented to a
slight extent by this division of profits in
the Auditor-General’s annual report, which
otherwise throws no light on the bank’s
affairs: —-

The curtailment of profitable activities
directly associated with war-time conditions
—particularly with respect to loan flotations
and exchanges—probably accounts for most
of the falling-off of earnings from general
banking business. Money in London has also
been earning considerably less than it did a
few years ago. On the savings bank side
the raising of depositors’ interest to p.c.
in 1920 has been partly responsible for
smaller profits, though the ‘decline from
£80,266 in 1918 to £55,226 last year—de-
posits having meanwhile more than doubled
—is a matter which surely demands some
explanation from the management. When
the Federal Parliament next gives attention
to the Commonwealth Bank Act it should not
hesitate to insist that ail accounts shall be
presented in detail, and that the Governor
and his aides shall report regularly to Par-
liament on happenings during accounting
periods.
In the following comparisons, grouping
some balance-sheet figures, it has been im-
possible to separate general and savings
assets:—

How much of the 27£ millions of general
-deposits was carrying interest, or how m ch
was Government money, is not told. The
mixing of investments and other assets back-
ing both lots of deposits prevents the appli-
cation of the acid-tests which generally
enable the public to ascertain the soundness
of banking enterprises. Nevertheless, the
figures as presented indicate that the Com-
monwealth Bank is very robust, quite apart
from the Government guarantee.
The Commonwealth Bank developed with
astonishing rapidity when financing of war
operations began and money-market condi-
tions became abnormal. By that time the
enterprise was soundly established and in
smooth working order. A substantial con-
nection, apart from Government accounts,
had been attracted without interfering seri-
ously with existing banks. In fact, th s
“experiment in State socialism,” as directed
by Denison Miller, has not attempted to
undercut the Associated Banks’ rates. It
did, however/effect big savings for the Com-
monwealth Government in - some matters.
Prior to the war the London cost of under-
writing loans averaged 2.35 p.c,; the Com-
monwealth Bank raised more than 250 mil-
lions at a cost of slightly less than .3 p.c.
Taking into account the reduced charges for
managing the loans during their currency,
there will be a total saving of a half-million
or so. Besides these operations the Com-
monwealth Bank took the lead in financing
the various produce pools. Not quite 11
years ago Denison Miller started with a tem-
porary advance of £5OOO from the Treasury ;
at December 31 his balance-sheet total, apart
from the note-issue department, amounted to
nearly 74| millions. That included the totals
of the Queensland and Tas. State savings
banks which were transferred. The bark
now’ handles the accounts of a couple of State
Governments, negotiates their loans, has
more than 60 branches of its own and nearly
3200 agencies to assist its savings bank acti-
vities. In 10i} years £4,198,966 of profit has
accumulated, but the whole of that cannot
be regarded as permanent funds. Half of
it is the bank’s owm reserve; the balance
is in a redemption fund which, in the first
instance, is to be applied to redeeming Trea-
sury advances and stock or debentures issued
by the bank —no funds have been raised in
this way—and “any excess may be used for
the purposes of the redemption of any Com-
monwealth debts, or State debts taken over
by the Commonwealth.” So far the Govern-
ment has not received a penny except in-
directly through the savings effected in ser-
vices. The bank is not even called upon to
pay taxes into the Treasury. At June 30
last, the Auditor-General’s report disclosed,
no less than £86,633 had accumulated in a
staff superannuation fund.

The ordinary div. rate has fallen to 5 p.c.
again, and the average for the past 10
years has been only 7 5 p.c. p.a. There has
not been the looked-for glitter in the movie
business, and, so far as this co. is concerned,
the big amalgamation of hiring and exhibit-
ing interests effected 10 years ago has not
produced the results generally expected of a
powerful combine. Amalgamated Pictures
took over the pioneer enterprise of the Tait
brethren in Vic., and later on linked up with
the General Film Co. Its holding in that
concern is represented by 43,808 £1 fully-
paids in Union Theatres and the same num-
ber of shares in Australasian Films, Ltd.
In addition, it holds £11,700 of General
Film debentures. There is considerable
goodwill m. the share interests, but Amalga-
mated directors very wisely did not regard
that asset as of much value: they took the
scrip into their- books at face value, but on
the other side of the balance-sheet introduced
a “capital realisation reserve” of £59,664
“to provide for any fluctuation in the value
of shares.” The introductory table —which
shows £75.950 aiding £72,710 paid capital
—includes this realisation account, hence re-
serves are labelled “nominal.” Besides its
interests in the General Film Co. and sub-
sidiaries, Amalgamated Pictures owns the
freehold of the St. Kilda Theatre and the
leasehold of the Majestic, and has share in-
terests in movie-halls at Geelong (£2500),
Moonee Ponds (£1000) and Northcote
(£500). Its own properties have been show-
ing fairly steady returns, but divs. from
share interests have been very erratic:—

condition of the controlling and subsidiary’
cos.

In eight years liabilities (including provi-
sion for taxation) have declined £11,905.
War Loan, book debts and cash tot up about
£lOO less. So the co.’s position has improved
somewhat after paying a mild rate of div.
At February 28 liquid assets (not including
share and debenture interests) exceeded all
liabilities by £13,093, but that includes sink-
ing fund investments in respect of the Majes-
tic leasehold.

That table gives one view of the very pros-
perous career of this big dealer in time-pay-
ment business. The following comparison
is additional evidence :

Liabilities .. .. £59,014 £38,010
Total assets .. .. 184,486 341,930
Net assets .. .. £125,472 £303,920
In 10 years net assets (book value) had
expanded £178,448, and the only new capital
introduced during that period was £5644 from
shareholders and £768 from employees, the
latter staff bonuses. In 1912 paid capital
was £81,963; at December 31 last no less
than £148,393 of accumulated profits had
been converted into bonus scrip. Some of
those additions to capital did not come from
disclosed profits: the management had also
accumulated internal reserves which were
brought to light when the directors thought
fit. With a shake of the sleeve they are
now disclosing £36,000 more, which is to
be employed to pay up 10s. per share on the
contribs., which were issued as bonus shares
paid to 10s. two years ago. That will take
paid capital to £272,768, and £184,393 of
it has come out of profits. It is a stunning
performance, particularly when the extent
of the t.-p. business is considered. Assets
at December 31 were as follows: Leasehold
property and plant, £15,008; stock, £77,160;
book debts, £75,447; shares, debentures and
short loans, £103,121; mortgages, £50,976;
War Loan, £19,941; cash, £277, After hav-
ing unearthed £36,000 of internal reserves
recently the directors assured shareholders
that “provision had been made for contin-
gencies, and that the co.’s investments were
of a thoroughly reliable nature.”
Gordon’s big line is its cash-orders: it
makes paper-advances to clients which are
negotiable at a string of retailors. The loans
are small and interest is stiff, though on in-
dividual accounts the charge looks trifling.
The co. turns over its loan funds rapidly,
and for 20 weeks charges 5 p.c. on a prin-
cipal which is gradually extinguished by
weekly collections. Then there is the eo.’s
own furnishing business, much of Which is
also on t.-p. terms. In addition, investments
are turning in a tidy income. Inciden-
tally, the profits claimed by the directors for
any year do not coincide with the figures in
the introductory table. In the first column
of the comparison below the net profits dis-
closed by the management are shown, and
visible additions to reserves in the second
column —the two together making up the
profits shown in the introductory table :

This co. holds all the scrip in three subsidi-
ary concerns: shares with a book value of
£589,996 in a. Melbourne warehouse and
retail drapery, to which the old Robertson
and Moffat business was added during the
past year; £54,997 in knitting mills; and
£lOO,OOO in woollen mills. In addition the
co. has £426,967 on deposit with the three
cos. The only other assets are cash in hand,
£73,784, and interest accrued, £4025. No
particulars are available as to the actual state
of health of the subsidiaries, though the man-
agement talks in superlatives of the past
year’s performances. The 12| p.c. div. on
ordinaries certainly supports the directors’
enthusiasm. The public is interested in
the prefs.: there are half a million carrying
9 p.c. cumulative, the rate having been
lifted from 8 p.c. when a new issue was
offered 12 months ago. Subscribers to 50,000
of these shares during the period under re-
view paid a premium of Is. per share. Ordi-
nary capital is- £589,996, and there are also
74,300 employees’ shares paid to £45,965.
The prefs.’ 9 p.c. requires iTo.OuO per annum,
which was covered almost three times over
by the disclosed profits for the past 12
months, though some of the capital was not
at work for the full period. The assets
backing also looks good, but the precise sup-
port is not ascertainable owing to the absence
of details concerning the subsidiaries, par-
ticularly with respect to the presence of
any goodwill in the share interests.

Amalgamated Textiles (Australia).
Ltd. —This is the biggest and most ambitious
of the numerous woollen-mill floats which
have been before the public since made-in-
Australia woollens became the fashion. Two
graziers, T. M. Daskein and A. F. Man-
chee; V. L. Ilaigh, of the Henry Haigh wool-
scouring and fellmongering works; and two
York-street merchants, Wm. Johnson and
W. A. Doyle, are sponsoring the scheme.
Nominal capital is a million, and 750,000
ordinaries are offered for a start. There is
no promoters’ consideration, either in cash
or in shares. Numerous centres have been
selected as suitable factory locations, and
the promoters propose “a chain of mills”
throughout the Commonwealth. The first
will go up when £lOO,OOO has been sub-
scribed. and others will follow when the
necessary additional capital is provided.
Prospects depend entirely, first, on the estab-
lishment of good mills, and, for the rest, on
good management. The promoters state that
close attention has been given these matters,
and they also propose to import a number of
skilled operatives from English mills to train
local labor. The profit-earning prospects of
local mills are bright: the industry is now
well protected, and most old-established con-
cerns, which struggled in the bad old days
of Freetrade or low duties, are prospering.
The manufacture of woollens is essentially
an Australian industry, and, provided the
management is capable from the beginning,
Amalgamated Textiles should do well. The
only doubt is whether a series of widely-
separated mills can be efficiently controlled
from one centre: on the other hand, the pro-
moters believe that centralised control will
reduce administration costs, and that sav-

When the Commonwealth Government
floated its early War Loans its advisers in-
duced it to raise the money for short periods
in anticipation of interest-rates declining
when the world settled down again. On
September 15 £35,700,000 raised in 1918 at
5 p.c. will fall due. Treasurer Earle Page
is now endeavoring to cover this obligation
by permitting holders to convert into 5 p.c.
stock with a currency of 25 years, but they
will also receive an immediate cash bonus
of 1 p.c., which will make the effective rate
£5 Is. sd. p.c. over the whole period. In-
terest will be liable to Commonwealth, but
not State, taxation. This prospectus should
appeal to holders who want a long-term in-
vestment. The feature of the conversion
from the taxpayers’ point of view is that
the Commonwealth’s burden is not light-
ened: for the new loan the Treasurer has
indeed to find an average of £27,400 more
per annum. The currency of the loan sug-
gests that, in the view of the Treasury’s
advisers, little relief can be expected for
many years. Existing money-market condi-
tions have, of course, affected the terms;
and those conditions are so little favorable
that it is questionable whether the Govern-
ment would not make a better deal by pay-
ing stiller interest for a shorter period in
the hope of compensating lower rates ruling
within a few years. In fact, Treasurer Earle
Page makes out a case for that procedure
in the examples of recent flotations he men-
tioned in his speech to Melbourne Stock Ex-
change.
The rush election in Queensland, which
cut out the proposed last session, has de-
prived Minister Jones of his intention to
push through the Bill controlling oil-pros-
pecting. The provisions were drafted last
session, and the promise was made that the
bill would go through at the start of the
next. Two notable provisions were to be
the larger areas available for boring, and the
registration of qualified men for reporting on
oil areas.
The large Australian-built percussion-
drill for the Mersey Valley Oil Co. (Tas.)
has been completed and is being erected for
the deep hole, which Capt. De Hautpick is
confident will tap “a good flow of oil.” The
ceven test-bores of 100 ft. deep have been
completed, and it remains now for the deep
well to tell its tale. As against the decided
opinion of De Hautpick, Government Geolo-
gist Loftus Hills still holds out no hope of
a payable oil reservoir.
* * * *
Driller Roy Fife, at Associated Oil, Mt.
Gambier (S. Aus.), is now down 1830 ft. and
in blue-grey and brown shale. This forma-
tion is cheering the Associated crowd, par-
ticularly as there is an aroma around the
bore-head which excites curiosity.
* * * *
Vendors, at least, have unearthed a “gold-
mine” in the Bombandy Mount proposition,
midway between Mudgee and Hill End
(N.S.W.). In the float, which has been
oversubscribed, thev get £ll,OOO cash and
47,000 fully-paid 10s. shares; so there’s
gold for them whatever there may be for
others. The surface prospects referred to
by the “Wild Cat” (B. 22/3/’23) have now
to be taken into consideration with the terms
of this no-liability float. Instead of the pro-
position remaining in the hands of a comfort-
ably-financed syndicate which would under-
take systematic prospecting, it has been
turned over to a co. in which 100,000 10s.
shares subscribed can, on allotment and after
the vendors have had their bite, give only
£4900 working capital, with £10.600 more
that may dribble in from monthly calls of
6d. per ' share. The directors are holding
50,000 shares in reserve “to provide future
working capital for erection of plant.” There
is at present nothing to warrant a float on
this scale. Certainly there are good surface
prospects, but the reports of R. A. Rolfe
and E. P. Johnson disclose that nowhere on
the hillsides has definite information been
gleaned as to what lies below. 25ft. Some-
thing more than that is required for a co.
which is reserving 50,000 10s. shares for a
treatment plant, and makes large cash and
share payments to vendors.
Bombandy should not be associated with
the riches of Hill End. It is .22 miles as
the crow flies from that historic field, and
only 15 from Rylstone, which has never
proved a gold-producer to any extent. In
that belt of country gold has generally
occurred in small shoots sparsely dissemi-
nated through the lode, and though small
working parties often did well in soft sur-
face patches, systematic mining by cos. was
never justified. Bombandy has yet to dis-
close whether it is anything more than a sur-
face show—and development alone can prove
that. The stiff terms demanded by the ven-
dors suggest that there may be more thorns
than gold in the Crown.
Sydney is being introduced to the Digger
Prince Gold and Diamond mines, in 160,000
half-crown shares. The vendors are to get
60.000 paid to Is. 6d. and £lOOO cash. Con-
tribs. are to nut up Od. per share, the balance
being callable at 3d. per share per month.
Old Gulgong is the location, and it is pro-
posed to bore through the basalt to trace the
deep leads. The field has produced more
than £3,000,000 of gold, but very little work
has been done in recent years, and several
options have been turned down by dredging
interests. A. F. Penman likes prospects, and
the opinions of the late C. S. Wilkinson, one-
time Government geologist, are also un-
earthed in support. The principal objective
is the deep-lead underlying the woolshed-
paddock at Guntawang, which is virgin
ground. It is a legitimate prospecting go,
but the task of proving the deep-leads will
not be easy, and the disclosure of payable
results is wholly problematical. Everything
is hidden by basalt, and the co. will do well
to restrict its attention to boring before tak-
ing any leap in the dark. Deep-lead values
invariably become less further from the
source of the gold, and thorough prospecting
alone can establish the Digger Prince’s pre-.
tensions. When most of the old-time ven-
tures faded, one Fletcher installed powerful
pumping plant and bottomed on the Gulgong
lead only to find a duffer, and about 1903
the Mines Department put down two lines
of bores on the Home Rule lead but got no
values.

Muriel Tank field (.N.S.W.) is now re-
presented by one show, Taylor and Trevor-
row’s Golden Horseshoe, where the shaft is
down 60ft. on a lode lOin. wide. A picked
sample from 45ft. assayed 1240 z. per ton.,
and a reputed average sample from sur-
face to 45ft., soz. 7dwt. But why was the
last 15ft. of the shaft not included in the
sampling?
From an Emmaville correspondent:—
The Great Britain Secretary’s statement (‘B,
5/4/’23) that I had been “misinformed and that the co, ■
has, and had, no intention of terminating the tri-
bute agreement” is interesting in view of local
information. I had it from one of the tributors
that, as far as the tribute conditions were Concerned,
the men had received a month’s notice. The co.
is now introducing a scheme which will allow the
men to make up to a maximum of £6 per week,
but I haven’t heard whether a minimum is to be
fixed. The men were displeased at the abrupt termi-
nation of the old conditions, under which, with richer
dirt and better tin prices, they would have had an
opportunity to make extra earnings to compensate
for a long period of low returns.

Block 10 Misima (Papua) seems to be
doomed. Work was suspended in August
last, as sufficient ore could not be handled to
cover expenses. In the deeper workings the
ore had changed to sulphide, for the treat-
ment of which the plant is not suitable. A
call of 6d. was made oayable this month, but
B. H. Block 10, which holds 66 p.c. of the
shares, is not disposed to pay further calls,
and shareholders have agreed to cancel the
call.
B. H. Block 10 ’will probably have to
write off its Misima interests. As an alterna-
tive it could take over the show, but that
might be a greater calamity than cutting its
losses and writing “Finis” to the Island gold
venture. It is rather a bitter pill for Block
10 shareholders, most of whom live in, Eng-
land. To date the co. has spent something
like £130,000, about 265. per share, in Papua.
Despite the fact that Misima was known to
be a proposition calling for management of
a high order, no one seems to have thought
it desirable to obtain independent expert
advice during the halts and stumbles of the
past 10 years.

Westralia’s divs. from gold for 1922
amounted to £191.251, and all except £5OOO
came out of Kalgoorlie. The previous year’s
distributions totalled £306,958. of which
£301,500 was from the Golden Mile.
* * * •
The Westralian syndicate which acquired
the Gt. Victoria, near Southern Cross
(W.A.), has tackled something that will
keep it thinking for some time. The show
is about Westralia’s biggest lode proposi-
tion, but the grade is low. Weakly-financed
owners have for years failed to make good,
but possibly as a result of improved methods
the huge deposit may yet give divs.
4 * * «
Will the Ives Reward Board (W.A.)
please explain? In a report dated July 15,
1921, two directors, Williams and Russell,
estimated the main-ldde ore, then exposed
to a depth of 100 ft.. at 42.000 tqns. and
added that it should develop into a “won-
derful ore-body.” A little more than 1000
tons have since been treated, and now the
manager estimates the quantity in sight
down to llSft. at 25,000 tons.
* #• * *
Bendigo returns indicate that the current
year will show a marked improvement over
last year. In 1922 calls totalled £36,880
and divs. only £31.500. To date tins year
calls amount to £9400 and divs. £21.875,
the latter solely from New Blue. It is pro-
bable that Carlisle will soon appear in the
list, and there are chances that Hercules
and Ulster may also figure in it before the
end of the year. As several cos. are en-
gaged in costly prospecting work calls will
continue to be heavy. It is estimated that
the monthly costs-sheet is now about
£10.000: a few years back that would have
represented two or three days’ work.
New Blue (Bendigo) battery ran nine
days in the past fortnight, and treated 800
tons for 756-Joz. An important develop-
ment is reported. In a rise from the 760 ft.
to 640 ft. levels two lode formations were
passed through. The first of these is being
driven on to the South, and rich stone has
been disclosed. There is a large extent of
unworked ground at this point. Other
parts are reported to be maintaining a
satisfactory appearance. A div. of 2s. per
share has been declared, making 9s. 6d.
(£21,875) for the current year. The yield
for the quarter from 8180 tons is 81200 z.,
of an approximate value of £32,500; so two-
thirds of the product is profit.
* * * *
The last crushing from Clark’s, Charters
Towers (N.Q.), was worth £BO9 from 190
tons, a shade over £4 a ton, and to this cya-
niding should add another 30s. There can-
not be much profit in that, considering the
narrow reef and the depth and the distance
between the ore shoots. Unless something
turns up soon, Clark’s looks like singing its
swan song. For a small mine it has paid
wonderfully well —Bs. 6d. per share on a
90,000 issue paid to Is. Od. Tne scrip could
be bought for 2d. in 1914.
* * * *
Driller Berry, who put down the holes on
the Palmer for the late Jim Watters, has
got his first hole well under way on the
Rainbow line, Charters Towers. Expecta-
tions are that the reef will be struck inside
of 500 ft., and a further site has been picked
where the Rainbow and Mary are likely to
junction.
* # * *
Shareholders of the Eclipse No. 1 and No.
2, at Brookfield (Q.), are floating a co. on
the strength of Govt. Geologist St. Smith’s
report. The report says that values are
high; along one reef averaging Sin. wide
they run to 20oz. The other dimensions of
this shoot are not given. St. Smith reckons
Eclipse No. 2 will pnjbahly contain the big-
ger tonnage of pay stone, hut that as yet
it is only a promising prospecting show. He
approves of the proposal to raise funds for
working capital to drive and crosscut, with
a big possibility of locating further parallel
veins. The point that should be made clear
to the public is that it is not yet a mine,
but has a decent chance of becoming one.
* * * *
Queensland Government geologist Morton
has had a look over the Billy Hughes, on
the Normanby field, and the co. will
soon learn the fate of its application for a
subsidy. Meanwhile it is going slow on
its Frederick mine, but is contemplating an
active programme if Morton’s report is fav-
orable. The cyanide plant is almost ready,
but crushing has not re-started: heavy rains
have delayed the carting of pay stuff from
the Grant mine.
Walter Colley, g.-m. of the Billy Hughes,
has completed his sampling of Mt. Madden
and Mt. Buchanan for the syndicate which
was formed some months ago by Cairns
sharebroker Arthur Clarke to test those
Palmer goldfield shows. Forty £25 shares
were placed, and, in anticipation of favor-
able prospects, three times that figure has
been paid for scrip. Colley’s report and
sampling results should be ready in a few
weeks.
Robinson Bros., from their mine near
Irvinebank (N.Q.), have just cleaned up
7 tons. 3cwt. tin concentrates from 20 tons
4cwt. of stone crushed at the State Battery.
The concentrates assay 75.5p.c. Their pre-
vious crushing of 22 tons 6cwt. stone gave
9j tons of the same grade concentrates.
« * * *
From J. Kenna. chairman of directors of
the Ulam White Marble Co. (Q.) :
The statement (B. 5/4/’23) regarding the quality
of Ulam marble is likely to create a wrong impres-
sion. In August, 1921, the co. submitted samples
of its marble to Professor 11. C. Richards, D.Sc., of
Queensland Uni., for the compression test, with the
following results: Sample 1,55701 b. per sq. in.
resistance; sample 2,52221 b. ; sample 3,62251 b.
In his report Professor Richards says: “Compared
with Carrara marble this is quite reasonable. Vogt
gives Carrara (Italian) marble as having a resist-
ance to crushing of 63291 b. per sq. inch (ordinary
44501 b.).” So Ulam marble has practically the
same resistance as the best Italian marble. Sculptor
Harold Parker, who has tested Ulam marble, says:—
It is ’certainly very fine marble. This last block
seems to me equal to any. There ought to be a
great demand for this in London. Most of the best
sculpture is done in Terravezza marble. This last
block appears to me to be equal to it.
There is no better test as to the fineness of the
quality of marble than its suitableness for sculpture.
The statement that Ulam marble is becoming
coarser and softer as it goes down is absolutely
without foundation. The co. has at present £5OOO
worth of marble on hand, every block of which it is
prepared to guarantee, but it cannot possibly com-
pete with Italian marble owing principally to the
rate of exchange operating against us to the extent
of about 40 p.c. The Italians are taking full advan-
tage of this, and are flooding the market.
The Ulam quarries contain millions of feet of
beautiful white marble of a quality and texture not
excelled by any other country. It is really unique.
Recently the co. offered to supply a large number
of blocks of “Srowflake” for a special purpose of
these dimensions: 23ft. x 2ft. 3in. x 2ft. 3in. I ven-
ture to say that no Italian quarry could turn out
such blocks.
The Ulam quarries are only 13 miles from rail,
not 20. If the output warranted it, no difficulty
would be experienced in reducing the cost of car-
riage either by constructing a tramline from Bagcol
to the quarries, or by using motor lorries. The co.
has installed machinery and plant, costing about
£7OOO, on its quarries, but owing to the slump in
the marble market, consequent upon the dumping
of large quantities by the Italians, it has been com-
pelled to cease operations until conditions are more
favorable.
rh * *
North Mt. Farrell (Tas.) is pushing No.
7 crosscut for the lode, and expects to cut
galena shortly. Output has dropped to about
100 tons silver-lead ore per fortnight, de-
velopihent work having failed to keep pace
with extraction. O. B. Williams, like all
other Speck m.ne-managers, is handicapped
by a shortage of skilled labor. How-
ever, a sound policy of development is under
way, and the mine generally is looking well.
A Bendigo syndicate is investigating the
old Tasmania gold-mine at Beaconsheld
(Tas.). The possibility of obtaining cheap
hydro-electric power from the Government
is claimed to give the mine another chance;
but the absence of a milling-plant—the old
battery was sold some time ago to b edera-
tion tin—and the state of the mainshaft and
underground workings will make the pro-
position very costly. Above the 1500th. level
very little ore remains, and it was considered
too poor even for tributors, who, for a time,
worked for about ss. per shift. The pay-ore
shoot was apparently shortening to a point
with depth, and that considerably influenced
late manager Heathcote in his decision to
shut down. This contention was borne out
by John Taylor’s engineer, who considered
that at or about liOOft. the two converg-
ing boundaries of the good ore would
meet. There is still a small block of high-
grade ore east on the 500 ft. level, directly
under the Methodist Church in the main
street, but the co. thought it better policy
to leave that rather than risk damaging the
church and facing the angry Cousin Jack
adherents. # #
In the early days of Zeehan (Tas.) the
Colonel North was a prom nent mine. It
had a 13ft. lode of high-grade galena, but
a slide cut it off. More than £lOO,OOO was
spent in Irving to locate the lode, one drive
going 1100 ft. into hard country. After a
lapse of nearly 30 years a prospecting party
claims to have discovered the continuation
of the lode. # #

H.C.L. AGAIN.
H UBBY: “You know, 1 have so many old
clothes to throw away that, I sometimes
think it is a pity we have no small sons
they could be cut down for.”
W IFEY: “My dear, if we had any small sons
you wouldn’t have any old clothes to
throw away.”
“Howitzer”: There was a “lead-swinger”
of Gallipoli days who played Simple Simon
so well that lie got from Anzac to the Palace
Hospital, Heliopolis, where he was placed
under observation. He had developed a curi-
ous mania for chasing stray bits of paper,
scrutinising them closely anil throwing them
disgustedly away. Eventually he wrns re-
turned to Aussie and discharged “medically
unfit.” The sarg.-major sympathised with
Silly Dick, and as he handed him the dis-
charge warned him to be careful and not
tear up this bit of paper. He went st'ff
when the supposed half-wit answered with
a grin: “Not on yer life, s’major—that’s the
bit of paper I bin chasin’ for 18 months !”
“Orp” : For sheer
cussed wronghead-
edness commend me
to “10-2-4” (B.
22,/3/’23) when he
discourses on
Bruce and his im-
ported spats. It is
ridiculous to judge
the Australian
worker by a pony-
course sample. In
Melbourne, at ary
rate, the workers
dress in any way
but flashly. Their
best clothes are as
drab as “10-2-4”
would care to see;
Fleinington, the
football matches,
the Stadium o r
any place where
the worker congre-
gates on holidays
will bear this out.
Admittedly at the
pony meetings you
will see the flashy
type of Australian,
but lie is not a
worker. When the
s q u i bby gee-gees
gallop in Mel-
bourne, 99 p.c. of
the unionists are
engaged at their
usual job. It is
only the idle rich,
barristers, thieves,
tugs, pugs, publi-
can s, politicians
and the like
who can fore-
father on week-
days to lay their
toll at the shrine
of Wren.
“Digger’s Batman”: The British Army
Council has at last abolished the barbaric
F. No. 1. The S. M. Herald, in a foot-
note to the cable announcing this decision,
said that, the punishment was not
inflicted by A.I.F. courts-martial.” Wrong.
In the sth Battalion the guard was called
upon to help in a crucifixion, each man to do
his share of strapping up the victim so that
the ignominy would be shared equally. The
guard unanimously refused, was placed under
arrest, and its members sentenced to 90 days
—which, of course, meant 90 days’ depriva-
tion of pay—for what the “heads” at the
subsequent appeal against the sentence de-
scribed as “a very serious offence, being prac-
tically mutiny.” But the attempt to carry
out the crucifixion was abandoned in the
face of the temper of the A.I.F. on the sub-
ject. Another time some Diggers, finding a
Tommy “crucified” by being bound to the
wheel of a limber, invaded the Tommy camp
and released the victim, threatening to re-
turn and inflict punishment upon any who
tried to re-enact the penalty. It was the
Diggers’ own attitude against F.P. No. 1
that gave them immunity; and it is an open
secret that when the delegation of Austra-
lian newspaper “heads” met Haig at G.H.Q.
the Field-Marshal spent most of the inter-
view in trying to persuade them to advocate
the use of these extreme penalties in the
Digger army.

“H.C.”: Is it too late to enter for the
Malaprop Stakes? In a colony of Italians
in Bananaland was one Giuseppe who was
reputed to be the offspring of a former king
of Italy. The matter was being discussed
in the local pub one day, when Bill spoke
up: “Yes, lie’s the king’s son all right; but
it was by one of these ’ere Mount Morgan
marriages.”
“Azrim”: “C. McL.” gives good advice
(B. 15/3/’23) to those desiring to suffer
from longevity. The subject has intrigued
mankind ever since the insurance sawbones
refused to pass the young Methuselah as a
first-class risk. The alchemist sought to
distil an “elixir of life” from various chemi-
cals. John Hunter, the great authority on
anatomy, who sacrificed himself on the altar
of science, proposed to live his life in slabs
by a process of alternate freezing and thaw-
ing—an idea taken and elaborated in Hou-
dini’s recent “pitcher.” Then Brown-
Sequard’s experiments suggested the use of
testicular extract, which reappears to-day
in the somewhat modified form of injecting
extracts from all the ductless glands. Came
Metchnikoff with sour milk (modern “Rus-
sian culture”) and Arbuthnot Lane’s colon
excision—both promising longer life in the
absence of intestinal decomposition and auto-
intoxication. The latest contribution of.
G. B. Shaw’s in “Back to Methuselah” is
that longevity may ensue as a result < f pas-
sionate desire. But this is more Shavian
than scientific.
“Hal G.” : Whether Hickson has succeeded
in healing people I don’t know, but I do

accumulation of sick, halt and blind in our
midst came as a shock to the press and the
rest of us. No one had had time to dream,
or bothered to dream, that our side streets
and our back streets and our lanes and our
alleys could disgorge so much infirmity and
woe. The Age, when it was quite awake,
smote the community for the lack of fresh
air in the home, putting the bad-air habit
down as the cause of much of the suddenly-
disclosed ill-health. The paper was right; but
I don’t think the people who keep their win-
dows shut are to blame. Burglar Bill
is the real trouble. Many people prefer a
locked window and bad air to a crack over
the skull and a loss of property. And I
don’t blame them. A few months back I
threw my own windows open for the air
to come in. but William came in as well. All
the windows will go up the night Bill Burg-
lar ceases to prowl around. How he is
go’ng to be made to cease prowling round
I don’t know. But, assuming that the per-
sistent wrongdoer is abnormal—that is to
say, sick—what about asking Hickson to
try his hand on this sort of patient?

tio n. She was

her their bangles,

that she would

This case is a very' peculiar one. The accused,

Then the limelight was shifted at once to a
bold buccaneer who selects infants as his

on them at first hand.
“ J.H.M.A.”: There is a curious legend in
Parramatta that that venerable borough is
the oldest settlement in Australia —which, of
course, it isn’t. But Manly has some slight
claims to seniority of Sydney, having re-
ceived its name first, and also having been
an earlier seat of government. When Cap-
tain Phillip, being dissatisfied with Botany
Bay as a location on which to plant the
First Fleet’s passengers, went exploring with
three boats to the northward on January 23,
1788, and discovered Our Beautiful, he first of
all investigated the harbor’s northern arms.
Rowing along the beach in the most north-
erly of all, followed on shore by a horde of
binghis, he remarked their manly and fear-
less bearing, and immediately named the bay
Manly Cove. That night his party slept in
the boats in a nearby inlet. So that if those
two facts do not give the village a claim to
look upon Sydney as an upstart, there is
nothing in precedence. But Watson’s Bay
lias a still more venerable title —for the
boats’ crews landed in Camp Cove and had
dinner there immediately after passing
through the Heads.

“H.K.”: During the 1920 contest for
Cootamundra (N.S.W.), a shabbily-dressed
and obviously penurious elector hurled this
interjection at Greg McGirr: “How you can
be a Labor man, with all the money that
you have got, Mr. McGirr, is beyond me.”
Whereupon that audacious politician smil-
ingly rejoined : “And how you, with the seat
hanging out of your trousers, can be a
Nationalist, Mr. Blank, is beyond me."
“T.S.”: The “Angaston case” in S. Aus.
is throwing a strong light on the danger of
secrecy in criminal trials. A popular doc-
tor of the country town was accused of
about the gravest offence against a patient
that a medical man can commit. Two trials
have been held, and in each case the jury
has disagreed, so clearly there is room for
doubt. The public, which had absolutely
condemned the doctor on the strength of
rumor, has to wonder what the other side
of the question may be, for in both trials
the Bench—a different Judge each time —
has ordered, as lie can do under the S. Aus.
law, that none of the evidence shall be pub-
lished. The newspaper columns have been
kept clean; but those who argue that too
high a price can be paid for cleanliness have
an argument straight to their hand.
As “Lex” views it: —
If the verdict in the Myerson case in Sydney
has a meaning—and there are few jury verdicts that
have —it is that anyone who owns slum properties
may be attacked in opprobrious terms with safety.
The factor that weighed chiefly with the jury,
according to its foreman, was the spectacle of
Myerson’s houses: they were considered “an affront
to decency.” About, two years ago a Sydney
paper published a list of slum properties, with
the names of the owners attached, and at the head
was a great church, while further down figured
prominent philanthropists and commercial magnates.
The argument may be advanced that Myerson
specialised in slum properties, whereas his moral
betters only went in for them as a side-line —that,
like the housemaid’s baby, their irregularity was
“only a little one.” But in reason and equity an
archbishop or a big insurance man should be
blamed a thousand times more severely for allow-
ing his name to be associated with such a traffic
than a Myerson. An educated Britisher of stand-
ing is as much at home as landlord of a palace as
he is in the capacity of slum-owner. Myerson,
owing to disabilities for which he can hardly be
blamed, is probably ill-fitted to administer any
sort of estate but the particular sort he has
acquired. While houses which affront the sense
of decency of special jurors exist, someone has got

“If you disturb me again with that thing

“All right, dad — I’ll wait till you’re asleep.”
to own them. For many years, for example, the
Rose Bay Golf Club has owned some of the most
decency-affronting tenements outside . Asia. Clearly
the proper course is not to sell our slums, at a
good round profit, to Chinese gardeners or immi-
grant Hebrews, and then seek to vindicate our-
selves as righteous Australians by damning the pur-
chasers as the possessors of “farthing souls,” but.
rather by destroying the slums to put it out of
the' power of these deplorable persons to own such
places. And that is what we would do if there was
logic in us, as well as vague aspirations after a state
of virtue. But we are good Britishers, and so, in
about 90 per cent, of us, logic is crowded out by
Cant and his unpleasant twin-brother Snuffle.

“Out there they don’t bother about fashions. 1
assure you that the ladies don’t trouble about such
things in the hot climate. All they wear are sun
bonnets and very comfortable clothing—-no high-
heeled boots.” — Sir Godfrey Layden, president of
the Royal Colonial Institute , at a recent London
function.
All is hustle and fuss at Dingo Creek
In the shadow of Bellevue Hill,
Whence, day after day and week after week,
Sir Horrible Bounder goes forth to seek
A trifle to add to his till.
The manager he of a Sydney bank,
And a social star of the foremost rank.
“’Ere, shake it up there with them bowyangs, Mum,
An’ see to me dinner-pail, girls;
In me tea put a tot or two of rum—
Likker sortuv assists the thoughts to come
When the brain of the banker whirls.”
Thus Bounder, raucous, emphatic and grim,
And his women dash to obey each whim.
Now look at him bound for his daily toil
In his weather-worn bowler hat,
And his blucher boots, with their frame of soil,
And his trousers grimy with engine oil.
He deposits a careless pat
On his angular Waler’s coat of rust,
And dashes away in a cloud of dust.
In the meantime Mum and the girls work hard—
There’s the shearing to supervise,
And soap to be made from the cook-house lard,
And half a sackful of wool to card,
And a wheatfield to fertilise—
Oh, a hundred of these and similar jobs
That colonial life of its dulness robs.
The crack of a stockwhip is heard at six
And Sir Horrible gallops up:
Two friends ride beside him ; their rough oaths mix,
And they coarsely boast of their business tricks
As they throw themselves down to sup.
But suddenly comes the familiar cry :
“The ’rangers are out! To the rescue! Fly!”
On horses, on foot, in buggies and carts,
All surge to the scene of the crime:
In face of that onslaught of bold bush hearts
The criminals hasten to distant parts
With a minimum waste of time.
And Sir Horrible takes his homeward way,
Thus ending a typical Aussie day.

“Sidweelan” : “ ’Ow would yer like my name

“Scalpel”: Sydney now has another man

Robert Jones, while diving at Little Coogee,
bumped his head ungently on a rocky bot-

apparently all right. A similar accident
happened in the Balmain baths a couple of
years ago, and its victim is still alive.

“Tiri”; A writer in one of the dailies re-
cently extolled the humane prison methods
of Maoriland. They’re that, right enough.
I was stationed up-country, and boarded at
a place kept by a splendid woman tied to
a worthless husband. In a spasm of jeal-
ousy he shot her, pleaded insanity occasioned
by ill-health, and got gaol for life. Four
years later, attending the Ellerslie races in

osity prompted me to go up and ask how
it was done. The explanation was simple.
He was an exemplary prisoner, and after a
long period of ill-health was sent to the
Auckland Hospital for observation. After
a month there he was allowed to walk in
the grounds unwatched; then he sauntered
into the Domain alongside the hospital gar-
dens, and, going further afield, he walked the
quiet roads near by, always returning on
time. One day he saw a motor-’bus labelled
“Races,” and with the afternoon before him
got in and went off, spent the afternoon at
the course, and was just about to catch a
’bus back when I saw him. For all I know
he’s still on the prison books, and still going
to the races.

SYLVIA: “Will is very intellectual , isn’t he?”
MAY: “Yes. He gives me a headache every time I talk to him.”
“Skipper”: “Drayman” (B. 29/?/’23)
doesn’t mention the 10th Battalion in his
war casualty-list, though its losses were
heavier than any quoted by him. He gives
top place to the 25th with 3068 killed and
wounded, but the 10th had 966 killed and
2543 wounded, or a total of 3509. Of the
57 officers killed—nine on Gallipoli and 48
in France: —ten held commissions in the
original battalion, while several of the others
were “originals” promoted in the field.
Honors and awards totalled 260, and in-
cluded 3 V.O.’s.
“J.P.”: At the Footscray (Vic.) court the
other day a caterer was charged with having
allowed offensive matter to accumulate in
his yard, and the inspector drew a fearsome
picture of what the place looked and smelt
like. The caterer’s wife turned up to say
that the inspector had drawn the long bow
a little, then apologised for the absence of
her husband. “He is too busy to come to
the court, your Worship,” she explained,
“because he is preparing the Lord Mayor’s
dinner.”

“T.A.W.”: “Drayman” (B. 29/3/’23)
claims for the 25th Battalion 3068 killed
and wounded (excluding gassed). Admitted;
but the 13th had 1060 names of dead heroes
on its honor list before Feb., 1919, and some
have died in our military hospitals s'nce,
one at Randwiek in Jan. this year, Even
adding only 1060 to 2059 wounded (also ex-
cluding gassed) puts the 25th at least second,
and I believe that at least two other bat-
talions in the 4th Brigade have higher
figures than the Two Blues. But losses
are nothing to be proud of. Considering,
results, the 4th was probably the most
economical brigade in human wastage in the
A.I.F. Also, if “Drayman” is looking up
figures, let him find a fighting battalion with
less cases of shell-shock than the 13th, whose
figures from the Landing to the Armistice
are also 13-

“N.A.E.” wants more variety:—
Our journals have of late acquired a habit of pro-
ducing the portraits of society ladies, and mentioning
their favorite amusements. For instance: “This is
the portrait of Miss Nancy Richer, a charming young
lady, well known in our best social circles. She is
an outdoor girl, extremely fond of motoring. Her
favorite amusements are tennis and bridge, at which
she excels.” Apart from the utter idiocy of this (for
who is there who does not feel a mild pleasure in
motoring?), why should one class have such publicity
given to their likes and dislikes when there is another
section with far more interesting predilections? Why
doesn’t some public-spirited journal produce some-
thirg like this? “Here is the portrait of Miss Lizzie
Johnson, a well-known figure in Surry Hills. She is
very versatile, an adept at all sorts of laundry work,
and in an emergency has been known to cut wood..
Her favorite amusements are vaudeville shows and
Garvice novels.” Eleven times in one year an
evening paper printed the uninspiring portrait of
a public man, mentioning (three times) that he is
“a cricket enthusiast, and very partial to bowls,”
and (twice) that he has for years taken a glass of
cold water on retiring and another on arising, and
that to this he attributes his excellent health. For
a change I long to read: “Mr. William Smith, whose
portrait is here shown, has resided at Pyrmont for
some time, and is well known at Randwiek. His
amusements are very simple, frequently taking the
form of barracking at a football match. It is his
invariable custom to take a glass of beer at exactly
five minutes to six every afternoon. He attaches
great importance to this custom, which has in his
case produced astonishing results. Most public men
have their special aversions. Mr. Smith is no excep-
tion to this rule. His antipathies are lawyers and
policemen.” What is the matter with that?

“Wang”: “Bolem’s” tale (B. 29/3/’23) re-
minds me. A few weeks ago a pair I know
went honeymooning at a mountain resort.
They arrived at their hotel just as the even-
ing meal was being handed out, and in the
crowded dining-room the ’groom, Jones,
spotted a friend of his, one Jobson, who
came across and was introduced to the three-
hours’ bride. “For God’s sake, Jobson,”
pleaded Jones, with a newly-wed’s horror of
publicity, “don’t let on to any of the push
here we’ve just been married.” Jobson pro-
mised. Next morning Jones noticed that
he and his wife seemed to be attracting more
than a fair amount of attention, so he sought
out Jobson. “Look here, old chap,” he said,
•“the crowd seem to be gigging us off pretty
hard. You didn’t tell them we had just
been married* did you?” “No, old chap,”
said Jobson cheerily; “on the contrary I
told ’em you weren’t.”

“Otus”: “2nd Divvy’s” conscientious
objector who was dragged along the duck-
walk at Ypres (B. 8/3/’23) wasn’t a
Quaker —he was a Socialist. And the Dig-
gers didn’t unbind him and throw the ser-
geant into a shellhole. The Diggers came
into the picture later. The “conchie,” on
his return to M.L., gave me the storv him-
self. A wire rope was fastened under his
arms, and he was dragged over the duck-
walk for the best part of a mile by several
soldiers under the orders of a sergeant of.
military police. His clothes were torn oft
and he sustained huge flesh wounds. He
was thrown into and dragged through shell-
craters full of water until he was no longer
able to stand without assistance, and was
eventuallv helped back to camp almost dead.
That night the Diggers went around with
hand-grenades looking for the M.P. sergeant,
who owes his life to the fact that he made
himself unfindable.
* * * *
“R.F.L.”: Talking about Abdul’s military
qualities (B. 22/3/’23), doubtless the
Zulu and the Ghoorka are peerless fighters'
given their own weapons and methods, but
let the big guns boom and Abdul will endure
the strain with more fortitude than either.
I can speak only of what I know, so will
take the Ghoorkas’ performances in Pales-
tine and on Gallipoli as read; but in France
they were a distinct failure, although their
advent was blatantly trumpeted by the Eng-
lish Yellow Press. They certainly at first
put up some wonderful stunts in their own
special line, and fairly revelled in those noc-
turnal jaunts across No Man’s Land that
invariably left some Boche sentries decapi-
tated at their posts; but as soon as Fritz
commenced to make play with his 5.9’s the
Ghoorkas had very little stomach left for the
fray, and after some months they were all
quietly shipped off from the scene of action.
The apologists of the Indian troops attri-
buted their failure in France to climatic con-
ditions. This may have been a factor, but
most fighting-men know that Fritz’s big guns
were the real demoralising agents.

“J.C.L.”: Re “4641” on the Hamel stunt
(B. 8/3/’23). The Yanks were certainly
at the spot—one company was attached to
each battalion of the 4th Brigade for in-
struction. (They needed it, by the way,
for although they had Lewis guns and Mills
bombs they didn’t know much about using
’em.) But Yanks, or anyone else, “hiding
in the long grass in No Man’s Land waiting
for the zero hour to join the Diggers as they
hopped the bags” would have received scant
consideration from either Digger patrols or
Fritz. At that time patrols were very active
on both sides, and any “hiders in No Man’s
Land” would have been speedily dug out
with bayonet or bomb by a patrol or with
a. machine-gun from the front line. Despite
many tales to the contrary, No Man’s Land
(especially from the Somme to Villers-Bret.)
wasn’t the place to go for a stroll unless
your own company and those on both flanks

“Henry Horsecollar”: One of the ideas of
Burley Griffin, the U.S. town-planning ex-
pert who cost so much at Canberra, was
for a mosquito-hatchery in the centre of the
city, so that people might have exercise walk-
ing round it in their spare time. Now they
say the lake has been abandoned, along with
many other things that were planned. Some-
how it recalls the speech of Briggs. Parlia-
mentary candidate for Stoke Pogis. in a
play that was never written :
“Dunn’ the course of my long and honorary career
it has been my privilege to serve this town in
many incapacities. While I was mayor I promoted
’undreds of improvements. The art gallery, which
is my work, is built of the best red bricks through-
out, arid contains a collection that my daughters tell
me would be hard to beat anywheres. The side door
of oak, carved by hand, is entirely out of my
head. I was for years chairman of the committee
of our hospital, a hornate structure in which, so
I was once told, the death-rate is remarkable. It
was me laid the foundation-stone of a charitable
institution which there isn’t another like it in
the county. I mean our Home for Unbearables”....
A Voice: “Incurables, old chap.’’
“Anyhow, I laid the stone, and it’s there still, and
my name’s on it. But my coping-stone, so to
speak, was the hornamental lake in the park. First
we made the lake, and there was fish in it till they
WOULD DEVELOP.
“But father doesn’t think you can support
me, darling.”

to take up physical culture.”
died. Then as it blocked the traffic we made a sub-
way under it for the traffic, but the subway was too
steep, and it leaked too much, and at last it fell
in. So we built a causeway instead, but we had
to widen it so often that at last it filled in the
lake. When his royal ’ighness the Prince of Wales
came here and we showed him where the lake had
been his royal Highness was graciously pleased to
Bay he’d never heard of anything like it in his-
life.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though life still laughs and love still flowers,
And God sends wind and weather,
They say that this good old earth of ours
Has reached the end of its tether.
An evil tale is the tale they preach,
Heads nodding, all things knowing,
While in and out on the brown sea-beach
The tides of the sea are flowing.
Fate sounds its knell, and the end of day
Draws in for king and peasant,
Yet ever and ever, for all they say,
Youth laughs, and the world is pleasant.
Though kingdoms fall and man kills man,
And chaos rends and rages,
The world runs round as it always ran.
Unchecked by the weight of ages.
From birth of day to death of day,
From dawn till dusk, it races,
And none may hinder and none may stay
Its course through the crystal spaces.
Though gloomsters watch it, soured, forlorn,
Through eyes thought-dimmed and olden,
’Twill still go garbed with its hues of morn,
And vestured with sunset golden.
To rosy light, and liquid sound,
With dancers, singers, players,
Right merrily does it spin around,
In spite of the grim soothsayers.

“Whitehall” : One of the most absurd cable
messages sent to Australia for many a day
was that which attributed the late Lord
Carnarvon’s interest in Egyptology “to the
fact that he once casually asked the keeper
of Egyptian antiques in the British Museum
to suggest a hobby, and Egyptology was sug-
gested;” As a young man Lord Carnarvon
had plenty of hobbies. For years he ranked
amongst the half-dozen best game-shots in
England. He was a prominent racing-owner,
and during the season that was ended by the
World War Rivoli won the Queen’s Prize
(Kempton) and the Ascot Stakes for him.
He first went to Cairo as a result of being
attacked in both nostrils by lupus. In
those days the sun-cure was largely relied
on in this complaint. A remarkably hand-
some man in a tall, lean, fine-featured Way,
Carnarvon’s face was given a most sinister
expression by this disfiguring disease.. He
took a private physician with him on most
of his travels, and for many years employed
a member of a well-known Melbourne family
in this capacity.
Edward Twynam, Surveyor-General of
the Ma State from 1888 till 1900, who passed
out at Goulburn the other day at 91, came
to Australia in 1856 to survey railway
routes and then joined the Lands Dept. He
did the original survey of the Lachlan and
Darling, and, incidentally, a good deal of
exploration around these rivers, and laid
out the base line for the trigonometrical
survey of the State. Mrs. Gordon Wesche,
wife of the Australian general manager of
the P. and O. Co., is one of his daughters.

There is mourn-
ing for Miss Kate
Ryan, who had
established a re-
cord of 50 years
as a school-teacher
when she retired
in 1915 from her
last job as headmistress of the New-
town (N.S.W.) Public School; but
almost at once she returned to work as a
sewing-mistress to fill a gap caused by the
enlistment of many male teachers and’their
temporary replacement by women.
The Westralian Agent-Generalship will
soon be vacant again, and it looks as though
Education Minister Colebatch will take the'
job. It will be a lucky move for the big ex-
pressman. Some years ago as temporary
Premier he raised the ire of the wharf-lum-
pers by trying to protect non-union labor on
the waterfront, and the wharfies nearly in-
vited him to his own funeral. Now he has
mortally offended another influential section.
At a big carnival in Perth recently one ot
the chief attractions was goat-racing. The
goats and their young owners came from the
goldfields, where “stinker-racing” flourishes,
and for the lads the free trip to Perth during
the goat season was an uproarious holiday.
But the Minister discovered that six were
under 14, and the sec. of the carnival was
fined for “employing boys under the age ot
14 for the purpose of gain.” So if Colebatch
doesn’t soon get aboard the lugger and steer
for England, the Noble Order of the Goat-
herd may finish the job the wharfies left in-
complete.
Justice Mann, who is to try Nurse Mit-
chell for the alleged murder of Bertha Cogh-
lan in Melbourne, is a brother of the Mann
who beat J. M. Fowler for the Perth seat
in the House of Iteps. The family hails
from Mount Gambier (S.A.), where the
Judge was born in 1869. After the local
Grammar School had finished with him he
headed for Melbourne ’Varsity, and was
called to the Bar in 1896. though he didn’t
start practice till six years later. Some of
the interim lie filled in getting wounded at
the S’African War.
Father Power, head of the new Corpus
Ohristi College at Werribee (Vic.), was a
professor and chief of the R.C. Theological
College in Dublin before coming to Austra-
lia. For a term he was rector of Riverview
College, Sydney,
and five years ago
jumped into com-
mand of Newman
College at Me 1-
bourne ’Varsity. In
this job be has
been followed by
Father Murphy,
late chief of
Xavier’s, Ke w,
who is also Dub-
lin-trained and
held a research
scholarship at Ox-
ford in classical
archaeology. lie
has also found
time to burrow
into the teachings
of John Stuart
Mill and other

Power is 52; the
other is 12 years
younger.

MURRAY, who is

C. H. Mills, just dead in M.L. at 79,
was a school teacher, a miner and a deep-
sea skipper before going into polities. His
chief claim to fame was his 10 years’ agi-
tation for the release of an Italian named
Chemis, serving a life sentence for murder.
Chemis had been convicted because pieces
of the one newspaper were found in the
Wounds of the murdered man, in the scrub
close _to where the murder was committed
anfi in the pocket of an old pair of pants
belonging to the Italian. Only because the
police had failed to mark any of the bits
of paper, thus identifying those which came
from the ground as against the piece taken
from the prisoner’s pocket, Chemis was not
hanged. Mills was finally successful in his
agitation, and the Italian immediately showed
his gratitude by blowing himself up with
dynamite.
Lieut.-Governor Irvine has again taken
charge of the Vic. Rubber Stamp box, and
will hold the key till his Ex. Stradbroke re-
turns m October. He will have a much
easier time as Cooked Hat than he d'd 20
years ago as Premier, when he had to handle
a railway strike, do the cleaning-up after a
drought, and fume in private regarding the
delay of the Colonial Office in having his
Reform Bill assented to. The role of Admin-
istrator suits the temperament of Irvine in
his 65th year; hut he could hardly have en-
dured it when he was verging on 45.
The most unpleasant experience Watt,
Speaker of the Reps., has ever had was when
he was Vic. P.M.G. in 1899. A hysterical
woman, who constituted herself the cham-
pion of somebody with a real or imaginary
grievance, hit him with a horsewhip as he
was coming out of his office at the then
G.P.O. in Elizabeth-street. All he could
do was to remonstrate and scurry off.
Months afterwards in the Leg. Assembly
it. was explained that Watt didn’t do some
administrative act of which he was accused,
whereupon Higgins, now of the High Court,
provoked a smile with: “Then he ought not
to have been admonished by the lady in that
way.”
George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Her-
bert, in the peerage Earl of Carnarvon, rvho
at 57 years has passed out from blood poison-
ing contracted in his Egyptian researches,
was son of that Earl > who visited Sydney
some years ago to look into investments in
real estate which he and English friends
had handled, including the Northbridge
estate and the Middle Harbor bridge. After
a cruise around the little Hebrew-looking
nobleman said that no more English money
would find its way there.
Retiring Frank Walsh is the first N.S.W.
Parliamentary librarian to give up his job:
his three predecessors died in harness. The
first librarian was Walter McEvilly, in his
day a well-known sportsman who owed Yat-
tendon, the famous racing sire; then came
painter Conrad Martens, and the third was
“Bob” Rogers, a nephew of McEvilly, as
popular an officer as any on the Parlia-
mentary staff. Fellow-officers and “heads”
attended a lunch to Walsh the other day,
which was a change from attending funerals.
“Alastor”: Mick Kirwan, member for
Brisbane in the Bananaland Parliament, is
Theodore’s long-range orator. He used to
be a porter at the Central Station, and o’
Sunday nights his “All aboard!” could be
heard in every pew of the two neighboring
churches. One night in the Presbyterian
kirk the minister was giving the congrega-
tion “beans,” and pointed out that some weak
souls listened to every luring call and tra-
velled instantly to Hell in company with
their tempters. There was an impressive
silence; then Ivirwan’s voice boomed in the
distance : “Right through—all aboard !”
Passed out at Tocabil. liillston (N.S.W.),
John Costello, one of the squatter-pioneers,
who at various times owned a long list of
stations in Queensland, N. Territory and
the Ma State. He opened up the Cooper’s
Creek (Q.) country, organising and leading
the first little band of whites to go there
after Burke and Wills, and he took the first
stock out beyond the Bulloo as far back as
1865. Costello was of that fine type of
back-countryman, courageous, straight and
generous, to which Australia owes much,
lie was 84 when he took the East Trail.
Alderman Burton, the Melbourne City
Dad, will be 78 on May 3, an event which
his fellow-councillors will celebrate with
food and drink. Burton came to Vic. in the
’fifties, remembers paying £1 a load for water
from the Yarra in summer arid requiring
a searchlight and file of bloodhounds to find
the St. Ivilda-road in winter, He has been
28 years in the council, and clings tenaciously
to his Toryism and the mutton-chop whisk-
ers which he first grew as a young man.
But his main distinction is that he is Mel-
bourne’s oldest carriage-builder—he has been
running that business for over lialf-a-
century.
Charlie Mills, who was touched off by the
Reaper in Maoriland last week, was for
many years Seddon’s Chief Whip, and at
the end of the dictatorship the old man’s
Minister for Customs. Mills was native-
born, and spent his early days knocking
about Cook Strait and the Sounds in the
little trading hookers of the time. Later,
going farming and storekeeping at Havelock,
he was known from the Wakamarina to
Jackson’s Head. A burly, squat fellow, he
Ipoked like the skipper of a limejuicer ashore
for a holiday; but when he was handed a
portfolio he camouflaged himself in a silk
hat and frock-coat, and adopted a pompous
speech that made him the funniest thing in
the vicinity of Lambton Quay. But in many
a bay along the Pelorus the little goatee on
the end of a cheerful, weather-beaten face is
going to be sadly missed.
Another civil servant to get out is J. J.
Kingsbury, 'who, after holding the job of
Crown Prosecutor in Queensland for nearly
a quarter of a century, has resigned in order
to re-enter private practice as a barrister.
Kingsbury was once fairly prominent in
Bananaland politics, is a past president of
the Queensland Irish Assoc, and a prominent
man in the Methodist Church.
Archdeacon Boyce gave himself a birthday
treat the other day by going on a “dry” depu-
tation to N.S.W. Minister Ley. Though he
has reached his 79th peg the ginger-beer
enthusiast, who remarried only a couple of
years ago, is still a vigorous personality. He
has been rector of St. Paul’s, Redfern, for un-
told years, and numbered Jim McGowen,
N.S.W.’s first Labor Premier, among his
“boys.”
Miss Annie Rebecca Hallen, who died in
her 67th year the other day, was the daugh-
ter of Edward and Sophia West Hallen. The
latter, a daughter of Lieut. William Lawson,
was born in 1813, the year her father, with
Blaxland and Wentworth, crossed the Blue
Mountains. Edward Hallen’s name is cut
in the memorial stone of Sydney Grammar
School, of the central portion of which he
was the architect. Ambrose Hallen, a sur-
veyor brother, married another Lawson girl.
The Amalgamated Society of Engineers
in Sydney recently congratulated a long-
distance official in George Kidston, who now
keeps its register of vacant jobs. He joined
the society in England 50 years ago, and has
held office of one sort or another for 45 years.
Alfred James Kent, the new Government
Printer for N.S.W., was reader’s assistant
30 years ago, when Fred Ironside, the little
man with the tall hat, known as “the cricket
historian,” was chief reader. The Govern-
ment Printing Office was established in 1840,
and Kent is the eighth occupant of the
boss’s chair.
When John Sutton died at Hornsby, Syd-
ney, the pioneer of an Australian industry
went with him.
After doing good
business as an
architect and con-
tractor, he struck
a slump in both
Maoriland and
Australia, when
nobody seemed to
want anything de-
signed or built.
Then during some
household preserv-
ing experiments,
he was impressed
with the possibili-
ties in dried fruit
and vegetables pro-
duced in a whole-
sale way. Although
79 years old be
was still head of
a firm running
such a business at
the finish.
FORDYCE
WHEELER, who
with, Monty
Grover has had the
job of making the
Sun rise in
Melbourne.
Two lady preacheresses, one with the front
name of Mary and the other yclept Sylvia,
have been licensed in Brisbane to celebrate
marriages. They are the pioneers in their
line. Sydney woman has done nothing special
of late, but the Melbourne police have charged
a handsome and fashionably-dressed young
lady of modest demeanor with 18 experi-
ments in burglary. Her tender front name
is Eileen, which means Light.
A cheerful old bachelor and early member
of the defunct Athenaeum Club, Albert Bond,
passed out the other day at 81. He was
born on Brickfield Hill, a site now covered
by the big Hordern shop, and lived all his
life in Sydney. Bond found the profession
of architect profitable and was a staunch
pillar of the Anglican Church.
Mrs. Annie Moses, wife of Henry Moses,
of the N.S.W, Upper House, left £71,427.
Her widower is now in his 89th year and
reputedly wealthy, while her sons have wooed
fame as horsebreeders. Melbourne-Cup-
winner Poitrel was of their stock. But the
turf hasn’t had all their attention. Harry,
one of them, after being a champion cricketer,
became a champion bowler.
The benevolent old single-taxer P. J.
Firth, who at 88 recently died at Hobart,
whither he went “for a change,” had no
quarrel with fate. In early life he was a
railway man in England. Coming to Aus-
tralia, he for a while raised sheep on the
Murrutnbidgee ; then, towards the end of last
century, he started cardboard-box making in
Sydney, and built up a big business.
“Digger’s Batman” : Francis P. J. Killeen,
who had a perpetual feud with the Repat., has
thrown in his job as president of the Limb-
less and Maimed Soldiers’ Assoc. Killeen
had little tact, a warm temper and a supreme
confidence that nothing he could demand was
over the odds so long as it was for injured
men. This attitude paid while the war-feel-
ing was still warm, but afterwards his
methods often did harm. Still. Killeen has
done much for the stricken ex-Diggers, and
when he handed over the chair the assoc,
had £l6OO on the right side of the ledger.
“Xox” on some underground doings:—
In hoping- that the makeshift Parliament at Can-
berra will provide a proper gymnasium for members,
Blakeley, M.H.R., the other day scoffed at the dingy
basement in Melbourne where a few politicians used
to exercise with Sandow developers and what not.
The implements are still there, excepting- a fine
punching-ball which disappeared mysteriously; but
no longer do the rats listen to the heavy breathing
of Earle Page, who used to be a visitor to the
crypt. Page appeared in the early morning, and
the dumb-bells and clubs led a terrible existence for
weeks, until the Treasurer’s biceps and calves started
to bulge through his clothes. Michael Considine was
another who had curvature of the muscle through
stoushing the punching-ball, and Patrick Glynn
straightened his student’s back for a while with an
occasional field-day with the Sandow exerciser. Years
ago the late Justice O’Connor, then an M.H.R., was
a violent gymnast, but if he had been roosting at
the House during an all-night sitting he used to
indulge in corybantics with a skipping-rope along
the corridors in. his pyjamas. But f never heard of
Blakeley pushing the bar-bell about, nor have the
great majority of members been caught perspiring
over the pastime.
YOUTH AND TRUTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘She's not as young as she was once,”
They used to say in years gone by ;
But now that lady is a dunce
Who lets her youthful charming die
And takes to manners staid because
The years of youth away should fly.
“She’s not as old as once she was,”
Is now the cheerful social lie.
She’s not as old as once she was,
When she was forty, years ago;
She’s quite a juvenile because
Her cheeks with youthful color glow,
And at the other end of her
Jazz garters do her short skills show ;
She sets her festive days a-whir,
And no-one hints that she is slow.
She’s ceased to be a social jest—
Too many of her now we see;
And yet, all youngly as she’s dressed,
Youth sets derisive laughter free
When her young grandchild, nine years sprung,
Says as she stands beside her knee,
“Oh, grandmamma, you look so young !
Which is the oldest —you or me?”

iggii
Ability to stand up to the hardest task has made the ESSEX
a firm favorite amongst all who know it.
To-day the ESSEX is the absolute leader in its class, a triumph
gained by four years of steady progress, and sheer merit of the
car itself.
ESSEX success has been gained in two ways —competition
and contest have revealed its ability to out-perform cars, often
of two or three times its horse-power and price; amongst owners
it has made its irresistible appeal by reason of its comfort,
silence and, above all, reliability.

“Parama”: Custom dies hard, and in
parts of New Guinea the mourning mother still digs
up the recently buried body of her infant and pre-
pares it as a dainty dish to set before her best
friend. The white man’s law is all against this sort
of thing, and the discolored ladies are forced to
use considerable ingenuity to dodge it. There was a
deuce of a row recently because a still-weeping
widow dug up her defunct hubby and fed him to a
surprise part}' of lady friends who’d dropped in to
console and to discuss the latest thing in grass
undies. One of the village benedicts got wind of
what was going on at this hen-party, straightway
called a meeting of married men, and pointed out
that unless something was done to stop this nasty
habit of the women, the chances were that, he and
the rest of them present would sooner or later be
dug- up and dished out as sandwiches at afternoon
tea to a lot of visiting tabbies. His conviction
that their ghosts would not be powerful enough to
stop it finally put the wind up some of the old
men, and later word somehow drifted through to
the police. The officials paid a visit to the village,
warned the giddy widow against doing it again, and
departed. But the married men are not comfortable.
The}- say that widows are not to be trusted—especi-
ally where custom and kaikai are concerned.

“Dinnie Mite”: If “Yeltuor’s” (B.
8/2/’23) nerves are right again, he might like to
test an effective way of breaking up Bunny’s happy
home —at least it has been effective here in
Doodlakine (W.A.). Our method is to trap a rabbit
at the warren, and then, having stopped up all
entrances bar the main one, to fasten a plug of
dynamite, with about 14 inches of fuse attached, under
the' bingey. Then we let him go down the hole,
stop it up and retire about 20 yards. A little
muffled explosion, and the subsequent proceedings
interest the inmates of the warren no more. We have
proved this to be cheaper, quicker and better than
all other known methods, and we have tried the
lot.

“Yurool”: Years ago, during an invasion
of domestic help from Finland, consequent upon
Russian oppression, our old mailman, Malone, had to
bring out a cook to the station for my mother.
As Katrina’s English vocabulary was about as exten-
sive as the old chap’s Finnish, conversation was
conspicuous by its absence for the greater part of
the 70-mile journey. At last, when nearing the
end, Malone pointed out a large old man kangaroo,
and the little Finn found her tongue. “Oh!” she
gasped. “Mouse!” “Well,” replied Malone, “if that’s
the size the mice are in Finland, God help the cats!"
* * * *
“Raupo”: Jimmy All Foo, mentioned by
“Noswad” (B. l/3/’23), was very popular with the
shearers in the late ’eighties and early ’nineties.
When the Shearers’ Union first materialised in W.
Queensland, some of Jimmy’s admirers diffidently
approached the big-hearted Celestial, and intimated
that, in accordance with union rules, they would be
reluctantly compelled to boycott his pub if he didn’t
dispense with the Mongolian chef. Swift to cut the
Gordian knot, Jimmy replied, “All li, all li; I
sack him cook —I go cookey myselluf.” The Ah Foo
brass band (each member of the family played an
instrument) was a well-appreciated institution in
Longreach in its infant days, before the snort of
the iron horse rang through the welkin. In those
care-free years 1 was one of many bearded pards who
oft-times loitered opposite the Royal Hotel, in the
cool evening shadows, and revelled in the sweet strains
of “Little Annie Rooney,” “Molly Riley” and
“Maggie Murphy’s Home,” as they floated down
from the balcony.
* * * *
“D.H.W.”: “Widgee” (B. 8/3/’23) re-
minds me. Years back, in Maoriland, I used
to ride over to get the mail in the next deep
valley to ours, and coming hack would take
a short-cut, a sheeptrack, down the steepest
of steep hills. My mare, thinking of oats,
was doing it one day in spanking style, when
she suddenly propped all her feet together,
nearly sending me flying over her head. As
she wouldn’t move on for mild persuasion,
and I’d at least sense enough to know she
wouldn’t stop for nothing with her nose
towards her stable, I gave her a loose rein
and let her follow her own devices. She left
the track, climbed the hill diagonally for
20 yards or so, then dropped back to the
path. The next man who rode along there
went through. An underground streamlet
had made a erabhole, and the crust was thin.
He thrashed his horse for stupidity, and his
own stupidity cost him a broken head.
* * * *
“0.M.”: How is tMs for a unique
scratch pull? I was bringing in 200 fats
from Delamere station to Port Darwin. One
day, while we were watering the cattle in the
Katherine River, something startled them and
they all rushed up the bank. All except
one—a big bullock, which, when we rode
round to see \yhat was the matter, had a huge
alligator adhering to its tail. The bullock
bucked, bellowed and pulled, but the ’gator
stuck its front claws into the ground and
hung on. For a few minutes it was a great
go, neither combatant having a shade the
better nn noints. Fimllv w-'+h a PTcat
heave the bullock got clear with a badly-torn tail.
“F. Clinton”: The prickly-pear is com-
monly pictured as a thick-leaved, thorny army
marching oyer the pastures and areas where crops
ought to be. Few realise that it can get into
holts with standing timber as well. Pilliga Scrub,
one of the few remaining pine belts in N. S. Wales,
is infested with pear. Once the parasite obtains a
good grip it finishes off the smaller saplings, pre-
vents the growth of young trees, and makes the
cutting out of matured timber very difficult. And
afforestation of pear-infested country is practically
impossible, in view of the heavy cost of clearing.

“Lightning Jerker”: “Billy T.’s” blow-
flies at Haunted Stream (Vic.) (B. 15/3/’23) weren’t
bad; but. for cunning workers I dip my lid to the
able-bodied butchers’ canaries on the Tongalong,
Murray River (Vic.). They couldn’t blow our fish,
’cause we hadn’t caught any; and they couldn’t blow
our meat, ’cause we hadn’t opened the tins —so
blow me if they didn’t blow our clean plates on
the off-chance of our putting some meat on them.

“Skyrider”: Can any Abo. tell me whether
there is anything in the yarn about springs breaking
out in a droughty season? A Bungonia (N.S.W.)
resident, writing .recently to a. Goulburn paper,, avers
that this phenomenon is now taking place, and says
that old hands look on it as a sure sign of con-
tinued dryness. A few years ago, in the Crookwell
district, the same remark was made by some wiseacre;
A BIT OF A SHOWER.
“Did you get that there storm here yesterday?”
“Storm? Gripes, the bloomin' rain washed all the holes out of the wire-netting and I
had to bore new ones to give the rabbits a bit of air.”
but a fortnight later it began to rain, and after
four inches had fallen the springs were so deep under
mud that no one could say if they were still -running.
I have often seen springs break out in a gully on.
the sides of which big timber had been ring-barked,
and I believe this is the cause of the present bust-up.

“Allbutt”: Last season a sheep mustered
for shearing near Blandford (N.S.W.) was found
to be badly staked. A piece of wood about 21ft.
long entered the shoulder-blade and came out under
the belly. The end of the stick was touching the
ground and had been worn smooth by the continual
contact. Obviously the accident had happened some
time before, as the flesh at the entrance was healed
up, though the underneath sore was a bit raw. When
we pulled the stake out the sheep died in 10 minutes.
* # * »
“Ariha”: Mac Alpine will read with delight
about “Wal’s” giant goanna (B. 9/11/’22). Mac-
Alpine’s party of two was held up on the wrong
side of a Papuan river by a flood. The two horses were
let go, and late In the evening they suddenly gal-
loped out of the river-bed, where they had been to
drink, one screaming with pain. He was tracked
up and found dead with his entrails torn out by a
crocodile. This tale was rather tame to relate, hence
the invention of the giant goaniia. The then Gov-
ernment Secretary, Anthony Musgrave, heard of the
yarn and questioned some Motu “boys” about it.
The native in his natural state is very polite, and
if he thinks that to have seen a herd of icthyosaurus
will please his questioner he will have seen a herd.
So they knew of the giant goanna. Would they get
one ? Of course they would. Musgrave fitted out
a small expedition, and they returned with one. 1
forget now whether it was 8 or 18 inches long.

“Joseph”: Re “Pick’s” feathered alarmists
(B. l/3/’23). Years ago in North Westralia I used
to puzzle over the fact that, whereas I could, by
taking ordinary pains, get within rifle shot of a ’roo
in the open, I rarely got anything but a distant view
of an animal that took to the timber near isolated
trees. After much waste of energy and profanity
it dawned on me that a little drab joker about the
size of a sparrow was always to be found in the
particular tree my ’roo had discarded in a hurry.
While walking with a hunter I heard the familiar
twitter, and my friend exclaimed, “There is a kan-
garoo there, or one has just gone.” Investigation
then, and at many times since, has proved this to
be correct in 90 p.e. of cases, and “just gone” nearly
always applies.
“Brutus”: “Csesar” drew on Ms imagina-
tion for his facts about Pepper’s balloon (B. l/3/’23).
About 38 years ago Pepper talked of producing rain
by means of explosives carried aloft by an immense
kite and detonated by electric current sent along
the kite wire (not string). Hp made the experi-
ment at Eagle Farm racecourse. But there was
no wind and never a cloud, so the kites could not
be persuaded to go aloft. A few small cannon, lent
by the late George Harris, were fired off. But
there was no thunderstorm that day, neither did
we pay 2s. to go in.
“H.E.R.” : Mention of the Chinaman who
married an Irishwoman (B. l/3/’23) reminds me of
another saffron-colored gent, in Yic. who did like-
wise. He housed her in a fine home, and reared a
family of exceptionally good-looking daughters. But
there was a fly in the ointment. The lady used to
go on periodical benders. During one liquid month
she aroused curiosity by suddenly disappearing.
Friends called on the daughters with a view to pry-
ing, and getting no clue of her whereabouts they
communicated with the police. Two deteeu.es went
along and baldly asked the Chink what he had done
with the lady. ‘‘Me puttee her down the well,”
came the unabashed answer. The d.’s asked to be
led to the spot, and were taken about half-a-mile
in the Chow’s own paddock to an abandoned alluvial
shaft about 12ft. deep. The old windlass was still
in good order, but was covered over with bags and
bushes. At the bottom was the missing woman,
almost quite recovered from her shicker. She had
SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE.

plenty of good food and milk, newspapers and books,
and a mattress with sheets and pillows. As she
made no complaint about her treatment, the detec-
tives accepted her husband’s assurance that she was
“all li’ ” and withdrew.

THE PIONEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He sits by the door of his daughter’s home.
In the swaying dapple of light and shade
That sun and wind and the scented foam
Of a regal, turbulent rose have made ;
But all unheeded the brilliant day
On his failing senses its glory spills,
For his old, slow thoughts are far away
With his bygone youth in the Gippsland hills.
Far, green Gippsland! He hewed his farm
Out of the shadowy forest’s heart;
Those withered hands, that scarce can harm
A fluttering insect, rent apart
The stubborn portals of Nature’s shrine,
And the grieving trees saw their kindred pass,
With flower and fern and looping vine,
To clear a way for the conquering grass.
The world’s too wide on these northern plains
AVhere the Sun goes down in a sea of wheat;
’Tis the little paddocks, the drifting rains,
The long, lush grasses about his feet,
The ranges sombre with mighty trees,
The ferny clefts with their singing rills,
And the snow-falls white on the crests he sees,
Living again in the Gippsland hills.
He does not notice the perfumed air
With its falling petals and roving bees,
Nor the rose spray touching his thin, white hair,
Nor the grandchild clinging about his knees ;
In vain midsummer her wealth displays,
A dearer vision his fancy fills
For his spirit wanders in ancient ways
Treading the slopes of the Gippsland hills.

“Spenner” : When not in use, I generally
hang my saddle across a spar suspended from the
roof of the shed by two pieces of twisted wire.
There are no holes in the galvanised-iron roof, and
the stirrups hang 3ft. from the floor. When I went
to get the saddle this morning there was a 4ft.

UNCLE TED: “’ Struth! Religion?”
TED: “Yes, but different to Joe’s. I’m taught that we all come

and at any time during the day the pests may be

Every scheme, from poisoning to shooting, has been
tried in order to get rid of them, but their numbers
seem to increase rather than to decrease. Inci-
dentally, the deposits obtained from the ground at

“Skyrider”: I was pottering in the garden
when they went past, the old drover and his dog,
following a handful of tired sheep on their way to
the saleyards. The kelpie was limping, but just
before they drew level with my gate she jumped across
to round up a couple of stragglers. The old' man
shot out a volley of blistering profanity, winding

old man, as quietly as if he were speaking to a

“Bill R.”: The performance of ‘‘Nugget’s’’
small ironbark (B.
15/3/’23), which, after
falling, was blown
upright again, has
been bettered. During
a fortnight’s rainstorm
on the N.S.W. South
Coast, in 1904, a
lofty spotted gum
growing by the coastal
road to Xarooma was
blown over. In falling
it lifted and held with
its massed roots a
miniature hill of earth
and stone, leaving an
excavation that could
have buried a small
church. A neighbor-
ing cocky, to be first
in for a bit of handy
splitting, began clear-
ing the branches, but
he had lopped only a
few when he got the
start of his life. Pulled
Dack by the weight of
the mullock, the gigan-
tic vegetable sprang
to the perpendicular
again and settled
neatly back into the
cavity where it had
formerly grown. For
years after it flour-
ished, a constant won-
der to travellers, who
marvelled how and why
some idiot had ascen-
ded the long barrel
to cut down those few
branches. It finally
fell to the sawmiller’s
axe.
“Me J.” : I have always known the spar-
row-hawk to be a game chap, but not till the other
day was I aware that he would tackle a laughing-
jackass. Three or four jacks were in a big blood-
wood-tree enjoying the everlasting joke when a
hawk came straight at one of them. Both birds
crashed to the ground, and Jack was in a very
bad way when I took a hand.
“Boon”: Let me nominate for the fly-
weight fowl championship a week-end cobber, the
barley-bird (Cisticola exilis). He and his missus
own in bird right a two-acre patch of lucerne, with
a river frontage of thistles and purpletops. He’s
arranged to take the family for a run of a thousand
or so miles up north, and I’ve promised to put in
some of his performances
for the Council’s inspec-
tion. His fighting weight
is well under the ounce;
length (including a dinky
little fantail of 1* inch),
barely 34 inches. His
residence, a masterpiece
of bird architecture, is
an elaborate woven affair
of fibre and thistledown,
securely fixed to the ground
in a fancy basket of woven
and sewn grass. I hate
to mention anything that
might arouse the cupidity
of the Bird Burglars’
Association, but the eggs
are the daintiest things
in shells I’ve seen. They
are pale, opalescent, green
little treasures flecked
with brown. Song? He
runs his next-door neigh-
bor, the reed-warbler, a
good second for melody;
but outpoints him in a
full 24 rounds go. I rank
him above the yellow-
tailed tit. On bright
moonlight nights, when
the reed-warblers are go-
ing through their best
turns, the missus urges
him to put on his
star act. He climbs
aloft, and the soaring sere-
nade to his lady-love on
the nest is the best
in his bag. I hear also
that he is the only abo.
bird that sports a new
overcoat twice a year. He
puts on an expensive
looking tail and other-
wise disguises himself in
the off-season, when not
directly under the old
girl's eye. Between songs
he has helped to rear two
families of ginger-headed
kids and instructed them
in the art of keeping the
family patch clear of small flies, scales and cater-
pillars. Address ? Any old farm fronting any old
coastal liver from Cape Howe north —from September
to March.
“Tin Hat” reads an Amurrikan novel:—
It came from a lending library, and the well-
thumbed pages stamped it a popular book. The
usual number of bad men pay the penalty of being
slow on the draw: then comes the Great .Scene. The
hero is escaping from the rustlers when he hears a
noise as of distant thunder ; a flock of maddened ani-
mals is stampeding towards him. Suddenly the
gurrl gallops up on her horse, the animal exhausted.
There is only one thing to be done. Swiftly the
hero shoots his own horse, then those of the gurrl
and his cobber; the bodies are dragged together and
piled up, and the three crouch behind the rampart
of quivering meat. As the maddened herd surges up
the humans empty their revolvers into its front
ranks, then flatten themselves behind the
barricade. The avalanche thunders over and around
them, and mostly falls over a nearby cliff into the
river. In amazement the three find themselves still
alive, though unnerved with the terrible experience.
And thus the hero gains the gurrl’s love, but loses
his own herd —-of 2000 merino sheep !
“L.F.S.”: What is the record for deep
diving in the altogether ? At Rendova, Solomon
Islands, Roviani boys went down 56 feet and un-
loaded ballast from a sunken schooner. Present:
Rev. Goldie, Major Collinson, one Hayes and the
writer. The same boys released an anchor jambed in
the coral at a depth of 90 feet. Most of them can
hammer a sheet of copper on a ship’s bottom under
water.
“Tom Pepper”: What is the record of
kangaroos shot at one “sitting,” excluding those shot
at night when coming in to drink? Years ago, when
’roo shooting on the Overflow station, I and two
others tramped across a paddock a good distance
apart. I had khot six “singles” and was just think-
ing of returning to camp, as the sun W’as getting
low, when I heard the thud of many feet coming
towards me. I was in an open space in low scrub,
and I promptly knelt on one knee. Presently, a
mob of about 16 or 18 ’roos appeared hurrying in to
water, and would have passed me had I not whistled.
Instantly they all stopped and sat up. I was using
a 13-shot 44-cal. Winchester (12 in magazine and
one in barrel), and picking out the biggest and
shooting at the thigh, I dropped eight before I was
“spotted.” Those 14 skins made a very heavy load
to carry back to camp—over two mile 3.

“Azrim” : Aestivation, the summer equiva-
lent to hibernation, is practised by only a few
animals, one of them being the “catholic” frog,
which gets its ecclesiastical monikgr from the pale
cross decorating its back. When the billabongs
are almost dry it engulfs as much w r ater as possible,
becoming as large and as rounded as an orange.
burrow 3 into the mud for a couple of feet, and
lies there motionless. The heart beats very slowly
and the skin takes on the function of respiration.
When the rains again fill the lakes the croaker digs
his way out. Apart from some turtles, which
crawl under rocks, or even mud, for several days
at a time, the frog is the only Aussie to dodge
summer in this way. Central Australia is the
creature’s domicile.
* * * *
“A. Jocelyn”: When I was doing a bit
of reporting at the local police-court the other
day, Bill Duffy, an old offender, was charged
with “drunk, disorderly and knocking his wife
about, v' Washup.” He was fined 10s. When the
Court rose 1 tackled McZaney, the J.P. “\\ hy, sir,
I argued, “you should have logged him —or at
least fined him about a tenner.’’ “Tut, tut!” said
Mac. ‘‘Why, the man’s maize crop’s all waiting
to be picked, and he owing money all round the
town!” Then I remembered that Mac. owned the
local store and bakery, and I fell silent.
“Jim Carew” : Has any Abo. come across
Binghi superstitions relating to eels? Among several
tribes in Western N.S.W. and Queensland the bucks
considered it certain death if they handled a living
eel, but made no fuss about eating one when it was
cooked. The gins caught them, of course. 1
questioned several Binghis in trying to get at the
origin of this belief, but found them closer than
oysters.
# * * *
“Country Fed ” : “Wonki’s” horse, whose
sagacity saved him from death under a falling tree
(B. l/3/’23), reminds me of Nolan’s old Lizzie. Not
long ago Nolan was driving along a tree-infested
road, quite unconscious of any danger. Suddenly
Lizzie gave an unexpected and inexplicable bound
forward. A falling limb crashed just behind Nolan’s
back, and tore the folded hood and part of the
seat from its moorings. You wouldn’t have expected
such uncanny instinct in a 1914 Ford. But there
y’are.
• * * •
“210” : The shrewdness of the crow doesn’t
over-impress me. In 12 months at Iveera station
(N.S.W.) I shot the eye-pickers at an average rate
of a little over double figures per shoot. My best
tally, secured between daylight and breakfast-time,
was 23, and my highest return for the expenditure
of a single smokeless cartridge was five. I
resorted to no subtle stratagems. The muzzle of the
gun was merely pushed through a small aperture in
a wall of the hide-curing room, and the birds were
blown off the sheepskins drying on the slaughter-yard
fence. After each shot I collected the slain, returned
to my firing possie, and continued the good work.
The hide-curing room was not 15 yards from the
fence where the jumbucks’ overcoats were hung to
dry, and there were innumerable chinks in the wali.
* * * *
“N’lmporte” : Gundy was shovelling quartz
into a pass at the Hercules mine in Bendigo, when
•limma, the underground boss, passed by with the
advice to “whip that quartz into the pass, Gundy;
we’re short of ore.” Coming back an hour later, he
found Gundy seated on the heap (a crime of itself
sufficient to produce a roar from Jimma) and gently
tapping the quartz with a whip improvised from a
piece of fuse and a splinter of wood. “What’s thee
doin’, boy?” roared Jimma. “What’s thee doin’?”
“What you told me to do,” replied Gundy, “whippin’
in the ore. It’s not half as quick as shovellin’,
though.” For the first time in his renowned career
Jimma’s vocabulary was unequal to the occasion.

“H.M.”: Has the Abo. Council any reason-
able explanation of the origin of the expression “So
long,” meaning “Good-bye”?

“Pick” : My experience goes to show that
the fox is more successful in lying in wait for his
meal than in stalking it (B. 22/3/’23). With legs
widely spread and chin resting on the ground, he
crouches flatly on the likely feeding-grounds of
pigeons or ducks, and is expert at choosing a spot
where the ground coloring harmonises with his coat.
He lacks the feline spring, but when anything tooth-

some unsuspectingly wanders within his range, he
relies upon a stealthy lurch forward and a lightning
snap. Lying in the open in clear daylight, I have
seen him snatch up a wood-duck—the most wary of
all the wild birds —and in rabbit country the frequent
agonised squeal at night indicates where the murderer
has squatted in wait for the playful bunny kittens.
FRIENDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have ridden him far,
By night and day;
The gleam of a star
ifas lit our way ;
The sun and the moon
Have heard us pass
To a hoof-heat tune
In the Mitchell grass ;
To the West o’ West
The moon and sun
Have seen us rest
When the day was done.
Oh ! never a task
Have I asked him yet
To do, but to ask
Mas to feel him fret
On the bit, and to hear,
... ..
As the pace grew faster,
His horse words clear,
“I can do it, Master.”
And we have met
The wind and rain,
The cold and wet,
By hill and plain;
And known the drought
And the long dry
weather,
And faced it out
Together, together.
And this, to the end,
He will share with me,
As a friend with a friend,
The memory
, .
Of a sunset sky
T .. , ,
Like mother o pearl,
... , T
And he, and I,
... ’ , . ,
And a brown-eyed girl
Whispering low
In his small stiff ear,
Bidding him know
That she holds him dear
For his own dear sake;
And I stood apart
And fought the ache
That beset my heart,
Vet saw, and knew,
As my soul plumbed
hell,
That between us two
She had chosen well.
I hope we may die
Together, we two,
Under a sky
Of cloud-blurred blue,
With no pale, prying
Parson or priest
To shrive the dying
Man, and the beast
To heed not, ah no!
But, better than this,
The sunset glow,
And the wind’s cool
kiss;
The song of a bird
In the tossing trees,
And a shadowy third
At our obsequies ;
Just as of old,
By the grey colt’s side,
In the sunset gold
A girl, brown-eyed,
Whispering low
In the small stiff ear,
Bidding him know
That she holds him
dear;
While I, from my place,
As of old, apart,
May look on her face
And know my heart,
And yield thanksgiving
To God, that I
Have loved her, living,
And loving her, die.
So thus, life ended
At Death's brief nod,
Horse-befriended
Go to my God.

Providence sent weather from the prize
stock for Ladies’ Day at I'. indwick. It
gave the owners of hand*. me between-
seasons gowns a chance of a 1 ng them, and
many beautiful sunshades were unfurled to
keep off the sun’s beaming rays rom faces
that snuggled under jaunty little teques.
Around the vice-regal box an Indian atmo-
sphere was suggested by the curry-powder
shades worn by all the visitors; but Dame
Margaret kept up her reputat on as a taste-
ful gowner in a handsome black br scaded
marocain three-piece, the corsage and Piling
of her suit be.ng pearl grey. Atop was a
little toque of ostrich. Miss Henderson let
her secretarial job lapse for the day, and
tempered the harsh browns and yellows in a
tailored suit of navy and a neat black velvet
hat. But the Governor was the gayest
thing in the vice-regal enclosure. He smiled
benignly under a Tom Mix hat, and a vivid
shot tie of wine shades brightened up his
grey suit. Mrs. Bruce left her Pr'me Min-
ister to wangle with affairs of State, and
viewed Dav.d’s victory without his escort.
The warm day brought out many draped
things of flimsy quality, with little more
underneath them than cumbered the Egyp-
tian handmaidens from whom the styles were
copied. There ; s always a breeze at Rand-
wick, and one lady who had no nether secu-
rity for her skirt drape found it present'y
desirable to keep well to the leeward. But
the breeze became so mischievous that, fail-
ing to secure safety-pins, she left early.
The last day of the Autumn Race Meeting
was an orgy of furs; the unfortunates who
braved the sulking day of alternate sun-
shine shower and steady bleak wind without
them came away with sore throats and a
sniff. Dame Margaret wore her favorite
grey with tr'mmings of black musquash, but
sprang a surprise with a vivid emerald-green
hat and a black ostrich feather mount. Air-
man Geoffrey Hughes’s tall English wife was
a visitor to the vice-regal enclosure. She
was enveloped in a gorgeous black satin
coat, handsonfely embroidered in gold, was
muffled in skunk furs, and wore a big ' lack
velvet hat. Mrs. Geoffrey Fairfax, well for-
tified behind furs, was also with the vice-
regals, as well as Lady Stanley. Mrs. Swin-
soji, Mrs. Willie Collins and Mrs. Walters
(Jervis Bay).
The Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers was one of the
best-lookers in the official stand. She was
tailored in navy, and had a glycerined black
plume round her snug little black satin hat.
Mrs. Norman Burdekin, wearing a navy
and grey turnout, had a wonderful pair of
drop earrings—Australian golden sapphires:
they looked just like two faceted pieces of
sunshine. Mrs. Otway Falkiner watched David
romp off with the A.J.C. Plate from under
the shadow of a myrtle-green turban. Mark
Sheldon’s lady—who, by the way, has be-
come more slender than her daughters—was
all in tabac brown, and had a skunk shoulder-
wrap that made many a woman covetous.
Two of her girls were with her, in shades of
brown —quite an autumn symphony. The
Richards dame was another wearer of ex-
quisite furs; so were Mrs. Felix Booth and
Mrs. Tom Watson.
After David’s win in Melbourne his owner
bought his daughter a necklace at a high-
toned jewellery shop in the southern capital.
While selecting the gewgaw the young lady
warmly admired another which cost a mere
two thousand or so, and dad jokingly re-
marked that if David won in Sydney he
might think of buying her that, too. The
night following the horse’s triumph on this
side a suave person greeted the owner at his
hotel with, “Good evening, Mr. Falkiner;
perhaps you don’t recognise me?” The
Riverina man look puzzled for a while, then
said: “Aren’t you a salesman at Blank’s, in
Melbourne?” '“Exactly,” beamed the other.
“And you’ll remember promising to buy this
if your horse won over here.” And he pro-
duced a scintillating vision from his pocket.
There was no sale.
It took Archbishop Wriglit, Rev. Howard
Lea and Rev. Arthur Rix to turn architect
Burcham Clamp’s daughter Vera into Mrs.
James Neill Creer at St. Mark’s on Thurs-
day evening. And yet she didn’t seem a bit
unwilling. Vera’s pals of St. Mark’s Girls’
Guild must have stripped every garden in
the district for the wealth of pink lilies
and Easter daisies they scattered about the
edifice. The bride was in ivory meteor. Her
veil and train were of silk net, and gleamed
at intervals with silver. She carried a sheaf
of lilies. Her sister Eileen and his sister
Madge attended her, in early Victorian
frocks of rose taffetas, with black velvet
picture-hats. Tristrim Holcombe and John
Creer saw that the ’groom did not arrive
too early. At the Hotel Mansions after-
wards 130 guests enjoyed themselves.
Dean Crotty came from the coalfields to
celebrate the wedding of Lyall Cadell and
Dr. Harold Clark, of Newcastle. The pretty
little bride, in a blush-pink georgette frock,
gleamed vyith crystals and diamente; the
court train was of silver tissue, like the
leaves that bound her brow and the strap
under her. round chin. Sister Josephine and
two Newcastle girls, Ruth Miller and Marie
Reid, followed her up the aisle. They were
in georgette frocks the color of cabbage roses,
and sported a deep cherry ostrich plume
suspended over the left ear from a plated
head-band of gold and rose. They went out
of St. Philip’s on the arms of A. J. Swan,
Eric Traill and Allan Clark. The F. A.
Cadell couple gave dinner to 80 at the Went-
worth before bride and ’groom went off
motoring.
St. Mary’s Cathedral had a pretty Easter
bride in fair Marion Cailen, only daughter of
the Michael Callens, of Newcastle. Her
chosen was John Davison, of Girilambone.
Mar on was a vision of white satin, silver and
pearls; and the ’groom’s sister Brownie
and Doris Wilk.nson made pretty foils in
their o’d-gold and silver toilettes. His
brother Georse and her brother Dr. Arthur
were the groomsmen. At the Hotel Carlton
afterwards the cake was trimmed With ships
and sheep, to testify to the interests ot the
two families. John gave his Jill a. motor-
car and vai-ious diamond ornaments as sou-
venirs of the glad day. Father Moran, of
Nyngan, was the celebrant.
Contralto Lilian Gibson made Alec Scott,
of Taree, happy on Saturday at St. Stephen’s,
by g.ving him first claim to the musm of the
deep voice that Melba advised her to take
to London. Lilian is not going to Taree,
which already has another famous contralto,
Ella (Caspers) Maloney, to settle down per-
manently. Her husband plans to take the
voice to London in a year’s time, and, if
Lilian still cherishes the ambition, she will
train for an appearance in the Big Fog.
Lilian said “I will” under a tulle veil that
fell from a regal coronet of pearls.
She was a handsomely Junoesque bride in her
ivory-satin draperies. Organist Lilian Frost
boomed out the bridal march, and Mrs. Her-
bert Field lifted her voice in song. Later
on a few special friends were received at
the Macouarie by the bride’s two married
sisters.
Una Sherman, a girl from Woollahra, who
graduated at Sydney Uni., has been working
at a Toron-
to public
school for a
twelvemonth
now. There
was not a
teachers’ ex-
change in
Canada t o
place the
Au stralian
girl before
she set out
for that Cold
Land; bu t
as she had
made up her
mind to see
the world,
she threw
up her post
on the staff
of A 1 b u r y
High School
and trusted
to luck to see her through. She has been
interviewed lately by the Toronto Free
Press, which noted her “charming accent”
—worthy of record considering the things
said about Australians’ mode of speech. The
Woollahra girl is noted for her geography
lessons on her homeland; she has scores of
pupils and parents aching to see the Blue
Mountains that are really blue. She intends
going across to London in June to continue
her profession, if she can get a job; then
her goal is France, where she hopes to find
another berth, and so on round the world.
The Scott Fletchers’ only girl, Ida, hasn’t
yet fixed the wedding day. The only boy, who
is Dr. L. 11. Foote, of Ipswich (Q.), is
going to practise in the Banana State when
he hangs out his plate. After the orange-
blossoming, Ida’s scholarly father will leave
for England to do research work at London
University. „
Mrs. Regan, who arrived in the Moldavia,
brought news of the engagement of her
daughter Kathleen to McEvilly O’Hara, who
two years ago gave up managing his pro-
perty, Ballyglass. Co. Mayo, Ireland, to pick
up medicine at Trinity College, Dublin. Miss
Regan has been taking singing lessons in
London from Mavrogordato, erstwhile of Syd-
ney Conservatorium. Before settling down
she intends to do some further study in
Paris and Italy,
The iveisu Kings managed to fit a pri-
vate entertainment into* last week’s sur-
feit of jollities. They gave a garden party
Hi honor of Chief Scout Sir Alfred Pickforu,
and had a prize day for showing up the beau-
Les of Quambi lawns. The Boy Scouts
roped in to do honor to the Big Scout were
all frightfully disappointed that he did not
turn up in his shorts and slouch ; and they
took no compensation from the circumstance
that they were inspected through a monocle
at a six-foot elevation. The Kelso couple
and daughter Olive stood for over an hour
receiving early and late comers, who were
all presented' to the Scout Master. Mrs.
Kelso King was in the popular tan colors;
Olive wore ivory-brocaded marocain simply
draped, with a violet hat.
Iris de Cairos Rego, clever pianiste and
nice girl, is guiding the destinies of several
budding young Carrenos at the Conserva-
torium. She
herself play-
ed at the
farewell
given last
week by the
Shaks-
pear e a n
Society to
Elsie Dum-
ol o, who
goes to Lon-
don on the
Largs Bay—
by the grace
of the sea-
men. Iris
played com-
positions by
her brother
Rex. who is
a harmonist
of distinc-
tion. Julia
Caroli helped
to build the programme. Mrs. Kelly re-
told Portia’s sentiments about Mercy, and
president W. F. Jackson said flowery things
about the departing guest’s good work in
spreading knowledge of the Bard among the
youth of Sydney.
The Tony Horderns gave a bait during
Thursday’s tropical downpour, but none of
their guests worried —the whole 170 owned
limousines, or had a kind friend who did.
The beautiful ballroom was adorned with
tall palms, and tawny-tinted dahlias deco-
rated the reception and supper rooms. The
hostess wore a and cyclamen-draped
gown that suited her brunette coloring. The
Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers and Mrs. Pitt
Osborne, who were her house-guests over the
festivities, were in their handsome Golf Ball
gowns.
The Royal Sydney Golf Club gave the en-
tertainment de luxe of Race Week in the club-
house at Rose Bay. Cheerful yellow tones
governed the color scheme of decoration. Sir
Tom and Lady Bridges topped the guest-list.
French Consul Campana and his soft-voiced,
dark-eyed spouse brought along the still solid
entente. The Belgian Segaerts chaperoned
daughter Henriette. The Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers
was handsome in black tulle and jet. The
softness of black velvet enhanced Mrs. George
Vivers’s blonde beauty. Mrs. Hugh Main—
Joan Tregarthen that was—gave her grace-
ful kitten’s ear silk wedding-garment an air-
ing. Clemence Davies, a nice-looking Point
Piper lass, came into the social whirl wear-
ing a delightfully unsophisticated frock of
white. It was a big squeeze getting the
400 or so guests into the dancing-space, but
the overflow jazzed cheerfully wherever they
could find foothold.
The Innuendo Club had its official open-
ing on Saturday night at the Women Paint-
ers’ Hall in Victoria Buildings. Anyone
who is puzzling over the title can solve the
problem by paying 7s. 6d. initiation fee, and
swearing on a wet finger and an imaginary
cut-throat not to divulge the mysteries. The
Innuendoes burst on themselves and a few
privileged friends through the medium of a
masquerade ball, and be it said to their
credit that most of the massed masqueraders
dressed-up to the club’s title. The most
arresting innuendo or query was a lady in
a backless white satin corsage embroidered
in big black spider-webs, allied to a pair of
white satin trunks, surrounded by a black
tulle frill on which silver butterflies were
embroidered. She had short black socks and
high-heeled shoes. (Yes. she wore flesh-
tinted tights.) Mervyn O’Hara, who is the
president of the club, tried to disguise him-
self as Napoleon, and the forelock painted
on his broad brow might have won out if
he had kept his right hand buried in his waist-
coat instead of using it for hearty grips of
welcome. The decorations round the hall
were worthy of note. Friezes from Tutank-
hamen’s Tomb were freely and humorously
applied, there were a few futurist caricatures
and a clever skit on Lambert’s “Important
People”—all the people being the one and
only George.
The Country Visitors’ Ball at Sargent’s
on Saturday night was a function arranged
by Mrs. Carleton to help the Home of the
Good Shepherd at Ashfield. A crowd of
country girls and boys—mostly from Coon-
amble, Cowra and Gilgandra—attended, and
had a most enjoyable time. The frocking
was delightfully fresh.
St. Vincent’s Poster Ball will bring a few
more people into the limelight next Wednes-
day ; for J. C. Williamson, Ltd., is going
to operate the spotlight on the girls and
boys who will act as living advertisements.
Over a hundred firms are preparing posters,
and there are to be prizes for the most beau-
tiful, the most original and the funniest. The
gallery plan is at Paling’s.
Newcastle’s coal baron John BrowD is
not much given to entertaining, but he spilt a
few black diamonds on Monday night at a
swagger dinner at Usher’s in Sir Harry and
Lady Lauder’s honor. The sugar Knoxes
were there, but didn’t seem to enjoy it nearly
as much as the Scottish ballad kni-**u
Harry Lauder and his Hieland Lassie will
this afternoon listen —if things gang aricht—-
to the congratulations of the combined
Women’s Leagues. They have decided that
a title and a handsome fortune are small
recompenses for his services to the sex in
warbling “Stop Yer Ticklin’, Jock,” and so
on; wherefore they are going to offer per-
sonal congratulations at Paling’s auditorium.
Mrs. Maekinnon will enliven the gathering
by speaking of the value of Folk Songs, and
Mrs. Newby Fraser will tell how the natives
of India can imitate their birds. And Sir
Harry will wonder what he has done to de-
serve it.
Acting-Premier Charlie Oakes and Under-
secretary E. B. Ilarkness were invested
with their C.M.G.’s at Government House
between race days. Their families came to
the ceremonial, and Dame Margaret pre-
pared a dish of tea for them and the Prime
Minister’s wife and the Chief Justice and
his wife, Miss Ailsa Cullen and a few
politicians, who went round whispering that
the Acting-Premier’s C.M.G. stands for Can
Manage Greg.
Died on Good Friday at St. Vincent’s
Private Hospital, Mrs. Grondona, widow of
Charles Grondona, of Melbourne, and mother
of Leo St. C. Grondona, of the Repat. The
lady was a well-known Melbourne identity,
and a foundation member of the Alexander
Club. A daughter by her first marriage is
the wife of a leading surgeon of Guy’s Hos-
pital, London.
Mrs. Richard Arthur is taking her daugh-
ters Gwen and Beatrice abroad for a year.
They intend leaving early next week.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Five buds blossomed in the Government House
ballroom on the third —A. D. Walsh’s daughter
Elfrida; Olga and Dorothy Bruche, the State
Commandant’s girls; Grizel Gibson, daughter of Dr.
Lockhart; and Dr. A. B. Carvosso’s Beryl. Boses
and palms made a background for his Ex., who has
N. Territory Urquhart and his spouse staying with
him. They helped Sir Matt to bear the onrush of
the 150 guests.
By way of open-air treatment Sir Matt has been
making a study of the working of the Rural Cor-
respondence Schools, with John Iluxham and B.
McKenna to blaze the trail and Ted Hurworth to
act aa scout. His Ex. approved the system, and
stuck up for the old idea of paving the youthful
mind with dates. Hurworth, who edits the Educa-
tion Office’s Gazette and the School Paper, used
to live in the late Brunton Stephens’s old home in
Stanthorpe and wield the cane in the poet’s old
school.
The “Back to Brisbane” bands have retired to
their own fastnesses. No more does one meet with
arguing bandsmen at every corner of our world, nor
is there a bassoon groaning behind every bush or a
piccolo piercing the welkin in every park. The
trees are sleeping it off, and financial Brisbane looks
appreciatively at the ashes of money burnt here
during Easter.
Pioneer J. Shannon, of Wyalla, Toowoomba, has
been hard hit this week by the death at Holyrood
Hospital, Brisbane, of his daughter Ruby, wife of
Tom Maeleod, who won so many decorations as a
flying man in the war. Mrs. Maeleod, who had
been married only two years, was a real bit of sun-
shine, and the light went out too soon.
Bobs Ricardo took her Feez for better or worse
on April 4 at St. Paul’s, Leichhardt-street. Dr.
Merrington did the knot-tying before hundreds of
spectators and much gorgeous frocking. By way of
an innovation the wedding-wreath worn by the
bride’s mother, Mrs. Arthur Street, when she married
the late Colonel Ricardo, was Stitched on to Bobs'?
train. On her head she wore her o\Vn coronet of
orange buds, and the frock was cloth-of-silver
covered with ivory chiffon. Marjorie Ricardo and
Elma White were bridesmaids in flarite color, while
two tots as train-bearers were Mary Gunter, Dr.
Jean Thompson’s baby, and Alice, daughter of J. M.
Thomson. They were in white organdie and Dutch
caps. The cake-cutting was at Incholm, Grandpa
Jock Thomson’s old home; and Pilton, on the
Downs, sees the honeymoon rise.
On the same day Olive Lockwood Graham gave
hand and heart to Andrew Crombie at St. James's
Kirk, Toowoomba. Joyce Graham wa3 bridesmaid,
and Colin Graham handed over his sister. The his-
toric old Hermitage saw the wedding shivoo.
A diamond brooch was pinned on Matron Chat-
field, and a manicure set with a ton of good wishes
was handed her at the National, the other day, from
the Children’s Hospital committee. Mrs. Ted Theo-
dore spoke the part, and hoped for a pleasant trip
to Europe for the voyager.

Lady Honor Ward, Earl Dudley’s eldest
daughter, slipped on her matrimonial chains
with her Maoriland Major Alan Bridgman
in her little home town, llimley, in Stafford-
shire, the other day. The ex-G.G. handed
her over, and she had the support of her
younger sister, Lady Pat—whom we remem-
ber as a curly-headed tot of four—and a
Troubridge cousin. Sister Morvyth, who
married some time back, helped to hostess
the champagne-and-cake ceremony. The pair
go to India, where the Major’s regiment is
stationed.
The Society for the Admiration of Evelyn
Scotney filled most of the vacant space at
the Town Hall on Saturday. From the back
it appeared as if one of Myer’s dress-parades
had broken loose and distributed its gladdest
details over the front chairs. Upstairs also
the spread of confections was an unexpected
salute to the popularity of the songstress.
When she appeared the young madame was
assailed with tremendous clamor, and all
eyes were focussed on the close-fitting gown
of silver which alleged that an early Egyp-
tian fashion had risen from the dead. The
garment slid off the left shoulder, to be res-
cued from collapse by a couple of vast silver
buttons on the right hip, and there was just
a hint of lilac in the slit at the side to relieve
the monotony of the wedding-present effect.
Flowers began to be carted up early, and
before the interval was reached the bouquets
joined up with the hired greenery on both sides
of the platform. A large initial E in pinkish
blooms and two or three small mysterious
boxes, which were understood to contain
choice things for the innards, were received
with an especially enraptured salaam. The
Scotney bow is neither distant nor deferen-
tial. It is a frank and hearty bend stating
that the artist regards the occasion as a bit
of orlright.
The Easter decorative effects at St.
Colomb’s, Glenferrie, had been touched up
with a further consignment of flowers and
white satin ribbon for the marriage of Viola
Norgrove Clutterbuck and Ernest Guyett.
Brother Roy gave away the little bride,
whose brunette beauty, glowed in a cloudy
setting of white satin and tulle, under tulle
veiling, which flowed over a circlet of orange
blossoms. The bridegroom’s two sisters,
armed with sheaves of pink gladioli, partici-
pated in the triumph. After the knot had
been tied, the bride’s mother, in black, veiling
a steel-emblazoned white underskirt, staged
a health-drinking supper at her Toorak place,
Glen Norge, which ended up as a two-step
frivol. Daughter Fillide Dane, a pic-
ture in floral silk, lent a helping hand. To
the superstitious the union has already been
hall-marked with prosperity by the big black
spider which, after being furiously shooed
off the bridal drapings where it had perched
before the start to the church, was again
sighted at the ceremony sitting on a side
fold.
From where the vice-regal Forsters were
boxed at the King’s last Saturday they got
a full view of the female nood which set
the amphitheatre in a giggle as soon as the
curtain rose on the last act. The young
woman whom the second Mrs. Quilter was
supposed to have painted had a humorously-
nalced and unashamed appearance. Although
the G.-G.’s —he in his decorations and she
in her be trusted to regard the
matter with becoming dignity, the house must
have had misgivings about the two young
aides.
Dr. Stork handed the D.P.M.G. and Mrs.
Charlie Bright a new baby-girl the other day.
The thoughtless old bird overlooked the fact
that the Bright homestead is well stocked
with daughters. Mac., the only son of the
house, who is now brother to four sisters,
left Geelong Grammar last term to get
acquainted with the land before tackling the
responsibilities of looking after the ancestral
Queensland acres which descended to him
from the maternal side —she was a Macansh.
All the best intellects shivered on one or
other of the three Repertory play nights in
the bleak and draughty Melba Hall. It was
a good show; but it is hard for humanity to
wax enthusiastic when frozen. Clever Mrs.
Apperly, as the designing little widow in
Harold Chapin’s three-decker, “Art and
Opportunity,” was just one show-room
triumph after another, beginning with brown
afternoon georgette with brown wings in her
brown toque. One ducky frock of jade green
silk sported ribbon-bordered flounces all along
the skirt. The lady apparently recognises
the power of attractive frocking effects on
mere man, and she mashed the older peer
in beautiful blue satin evening togs, en-
meshed with tulle and designed to show
up the whiteness of her snowy skin. But a
red wig fitted the part better than it did
the lady. Her final push was made in inky
hangings with lengths of chiffon falling from
the armpits.
Uld friend Dicky Nevill is said to be
heading for the Harbor. Lord Richard has
helped on many vice-regal staffs, and his last
Aussie job was “Chamberlain ’ to the Dud-
leys—the first time the title was used here.
Although a walking dictionary of vice-regal
etiquette, the perfection of his manner kept
him on good terms with the crowd. Time
and ill-health are said to have left their mark
on Richard’s lordly person. Some years
back, by the way, a relative who went over
the hill left him something to tide him more
cosily along his later years.
For its annual Easter Tennis Week Gee-
long feverishly outdid the local speed-limit.
A big contingent trekked up from town, and
the squattocracy flocked in and simply
howled applause when Betty Fairbairn and
a school pal, Nancy Clemons, caught cham-
pion Esna Boyd and Mary Addison napping
half-way through the ladies’ doubles. But
the girleens went down at the end before
Dorothy Rendall and Cis Roberts, who in
turn were beaten by the youthful Toyne
sisters in the final. Esna Boyd scored as
usual in the singles. After the champion-
ships the most palpitating thrill of the seven
days’ whirl was the tennis dance in the
Corio Club hall. Here a brace of white
doves found their wings—Cecily Wilson,
daughter of the club president, and the Neil
Campbells’ younger chick, Alison. Mrs. Wil-
son struck a bright autumnal note in froth-
ings of brown-beaded tulle. Mrs. Gerald
Patterson wreathed the middle of her lilac
velvet hangings with flowers. Chief Justice
Irvine’s second chick, Nancy, revolved in
pink with opalescent fins, and the Lascelles
widow, whose husband was one of
the Princess Mary Lascelles clan, stood
majestically in black lace. A trio of
tennis experts, Esna Boyd, Dorothy
Rendall and Mary Addison, whirled rosily
in pink; Barbara Bayles was a blue shriek,
and sister Shirley flew a blue-striped pinny
effect with her rose-tinted skirt. The cold
turkey was laid out on a bier of pink carna-
tions and white poppies.
The best jazzers scampered to Barwon
Heads for the golf fox-trot fixture on Easter
Saturday night. The dancing happened in
the Colite Hall what time the elders punted
at poker or bridge at Mrs. Russell Lewis’s
place, Sunnyside, a stone’s throw away.
On Saturday David and Mrs. Beath will
celebrate their diamond wedding. He was
the founder of the softgoods firm of Beath,
Sehiess and Co., originally called Pyne, Har-
rison, Beath and Co. He came from Fife-
shire in 1858, and was wedded five years
later, at Geelong, to a daughter of W. H.
Bowden, of Barwon Banks. Mr. Beath, who
is 88 years young, was one of the early pre-
sidents of the Y.M.C.A. J. M. Bruce, dad
of the Priminister, was another.
This is Eileen Hope-Cooper, who knows
as much about current literature as
any woman
in the State.
It was her
original in-
tention to
earn her
crust as a
musician, but
she was
tempted to
look after
the circulat-
ing end of
Robe r t-
son’s library
for a few
months after
closing her
s c h o 1 astic
career at
the Gir 1 s’
Grammar,
and she made
such a suc-
cess of the
job that she stayed on. After the amalga-
mation of Mullen’s and Robertson’s she
switched over to Hutchinson’s, where she
now is, although she did quite a lot of pro-
fessional piano-play inv last year. During
the war, and after, her fingers and fine
soprano voice worked overtime for Bill, Jim
and Co., especially in the interests of the
Janefield Hospital inmates.
There is much sh-sh-ing in one fashion-
able little circle over the escapade of a girl
who, for a wager, did the Lady Godiva act
through the city in a covered-in motor-car.
The one stipulation was that the blinds were
to be kept up. Godiva was handicapped in
that she wore bobbed hair, but nevertheless
she flashed through the city like a comet, and
so far Pro Bono Publico and Father-of-
Seven have not been heard from, so it is
possible that few got even a glimpse of the
daring female.
Incidentally, the march of the motor-car is
being emphasised by the ract that now-a-
nights at least one lady of an ancient pro-
fession touts for business in her limousine.
And gets it, too.
Sylvia Shaw vamps in “Bulldog Drum-
mond” in two perfectly heavenly made-in-
Australia frocks. The first is a stunning
combination of fuchsia and gold brocade,
bodiced with gold tissue, with over-veilings of
fuchsia chiffon, gladdened by golden lining.
The other is a coat dress of peacock-blue cloth
hemmed round with brown fur panelled for’-
ard with Oriental embroidery on an ivory
satin backing. With this rigout her head
is tucked into a toque delicately balconied
with fur. Eve Gray ingenues beautifully in
a trio of froeky successes. She opens up
with black tailorings contrasting fiercely with
white fur wrappings and an ermine-edged
white velour hat. She next smiles engagingly
in a jade green silver tissue evening frock,
sashed with Oriental colorings and lace
drooping round the upper edge of the bodice;
but somehow her pale hair and the stage sur-
roundings disagree with this green outfit. She
takes her final curtain in black silk over
silver lace with a huge silver rose clutching a
side fall of pearls and silver.
Herewith Monteath’s view of Thelma
Baulderstone, an Adelaide girl who is to
give a dramatic recital in the Holy City in
June. She is
a pupil of
Mrs. W. Iv.
Langsford, of
Adelaide, and
first came to
light as a
seven - year-
old prize-
winner at the
Unley (S.A.)
competitions.
Six years
later she an-
nexed the
Grand Aggre-
gate at the an-
nual South-
street (Bal-
larat) con-
test, and es-
tablished
something
like a record
for youth'
fulness in fhe scrimmage. In Adelaide she
has since done good work with the local
Repertory Theatre.
Kerang, which has been storm-tossed with
its annual lawn-tennis frenzy, laid down its
racquet for a moment to shower congratu-
lations on Maurice, of the wool-growing
Officer brothers, over his engagement to a
popular local damsel, Charlotte Wallace. The
’groom-to-be divides his working hours
between his prize sheep and the Kerang end
of L. Fairbairn’s stock and station activities.
Hal Gye, the illustrator of C. J. Dennis’s
books, _ will be represented in clay in the
near future, the rights of his “Sentimental
Bloke” drawings having been acquired by
the Grimwade Co.’s Staffordshire Potteries.
Leonard L. Grimwade, the managing direc-
tor of the firm, acquired the rights while
in Australia. Some lines from the book will
be printed with the pictures, which are to
be transferred in color on to plates, cups,
mugs and other pottery publications; so it
is quite possible that thousands of years
hence the Cupid Bloke will “dip his lid” to
future Australians from beneath the morn-
ing porridge, if no one cracks him in the
meantime, and Doreen will smile gracefully
at the afternoon tea-table between the cakes
and sandwiches. Gye and Dennis will pay
income-tax on the royalties.
Western Districters mourn the passing of
Mrs. Wilfrid Austin, formerly a Melbourne
belle, Bessie Maclellan. She was a remark-
ably capable matron. When their Western
District property was not returning great
profit she converted the homestead into a
prep, school for sons of the local squattoc-
racy, and old Greenvale boys look back to
their schooldays there with pleasure. The
Wilfrid Austins’ only son, Don, is now a sur-
geon in the Australian Navy.
The most severe test of prospective Rhodes
scholars is the lunch at State Government
House, where his Ex., his family and the
selection committee meet the applicants.
At one such gathering most of the contest-
ants carefully neglected those dishes for
which one might commit the unpardonable
sin of choosing the wrong weapon of assault;
but when fruit salad arrived as the only
sweet, no evasion was possible. There was
a strained pause for some minutes. Then,
to the relief of those in her immediate
vicinTy, her Ex. daintily took up her fork
for the attack. Straightway forks were the
order at that end of the table. A moment
later his Ex. nonchalantly took up his
spoon, so spoons became the offensive
weapons at his end. Thus was the table
divided almost equally into “spoons” and
“forks,” and the poor unfortunate half-way
men had untold spasms of agony before they
could decide which faction they should join.
The Robert Power widow has sold her
Toorak homestead, Myrnong, which has a
setting of several acres of park lands and
has been in the family for nearly a century.
She now goes to Mathoura, which she has
bought from the widow of the late Admiral
Bridges, who, having settled across seas, has
no further use for the place. In the old days
Mathoura sheltered the Klingender family.
In older days The Bulletin’s Sydney
office was in Archdeacon Langley’s parish,
and the very likeable old gentleman, who
did great work in the Rocks area, was missed
when he was made the first Bishop of Ben-
digo. He died some years ago, and has
widow followed him last week, aged 81. She
was a daughter of the late Frederick
Strachan, of Bathurst. They had 12 chil-
dren, and all of them are living—Canon
Langley, of All Saints’, Woollahra (N.S.W.),
Canon Thomas Langley, of Caulfield,
medicoes Frank and Arthur, and plain
misters Archie and Aylmer; Mrs. Carring-
ton, wife of Canon Carrington, Mrs. L.
Pearce, of Neutral Bay (Sydney), Mrs. H.
Pearce, and the Misses Ruth, Hilda and Dferis.
The marriage of Genge Stodart Martin,
only son of the late Stodart C. Martin and
Mrs. J. O. Frith, Toolmarree station (Q.),
to Sybil Margaret Martin, eldest daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. 11. C. Martin, Hillard,
East Malvern, was quietly celebrated at All
Saints’ recently. The bride was given
away by her brother, Dr. Colin Martin, who
came over from Tasmania for the occasion.
The young couple will live at Barneda sta-
tion (Q.).
On Easter Monday the Launceston (Tas.)
Musical and Literary Competitions “came
of age.” The first session started on April
13, 1903, and occupied four days. Now it
takes about 10 days, with two sittings a
day, to get through the contests. Competi-
tors come from all over the Speck, and of
late solid opposition has been met in success-
ful spruikers and songsters from the main-
land. Last year the Southern (Melbourne)
Choral Society carried home the shield and
the £75 prize for the big championship.
These Launceston competitions rank second
to those at Ballarat as regards choral work,
and the aggregate prize money for that sec-
tion amounts to £l5O. By the end of this
session 10,000 people had taken part in the
competitions, and £lO,OOO had been paid out
in prize-money.
Ballarat Junior Technical School, which is
a flourishing concern, was built on an acre
excised from the gaol site that was formerly
a cemetery for prisoners. Five skeletons
were transferred to the Ballarat cemetery,
but seven other bodies supposed to be there
couldn’t be traced. There must be some
special affinity between gaols and technical
schools. When Melb. Gaol is abolished a
few months hence the whole or a big slice
of the site, including the burying-ground, is
to be given to the Workingmen’s College
(Tech. School). And hasn’t Darlinghurst
Gaol in Sydney been turned holus-bolus into
a Tech.?
A little gossip from Adelaide :
Among homing S. Australians is Edward Stokes.
He is the eldest of the Frank Stokes sons, and has
left the Indian education service after a good many
years to become headmaster of the prep, school
at St. Peter’s College.
Oakbank races had a record attendance, though
vice-royalty was “off”-—the Bridges being in Sydney,
and the Murrays, never keen racegoers, lunching
the Stradbrokes at Government House. It is said
that the Strads. threw out a hint to the P. and O.
Co. that the Narkunda might be delayed long enough
for passengers to run up and see a race or two, but
there was nothing doing.
The Cedric Haywards and their small daughter
have gone to the Cold Country for a year. He was
admitted to the Bar by the C.J. (a member of the
Hayward, Magarey and Isbister firm before he took
a judgeship) a few days before he sailed. Hayward
was at Oxford when war broke out, and during four
years’ service, chiefly with the R.A.F., was so badly
wounded that he has never quite got back to his
old form—his present trip is largely in quest of
health. Fellow passengers by the Narkunda included
the Egerton Joneses.
Gone west, Mrs. Bessie Moore, once a teacher in
the State schools, then the Government’s matron-in-
charge of immigrant girls from England, then head
of the women’s department of the Government Labor
Bureau, and finally housekeeper at the Adelaide hos-
pital. Two monuments will stand to her always—
the cemeteries at Upper Sturt and Gilles Plains,
which on her initiative were transformed from
neglected wildernesses into gardens.
The March of the Petticoat goes on. The Bishop
of Adelaide has accepted Miss Mildred Magarey as
a deaconess of the Anglican Church. She will work
in St. Mary Magdalene’s parish—one of the poorer
parts of the city where Archdeacon Hornabrook did
such wonderful things.
The death of J. W. Bakewell snaps another link
with the old-time social life of the State. For years
he and his wife had made their home in England,
with only an occasional trip Australiawards, but
time was when their beautiful house at Mount Lofty
was one of our best known and most hospitable
homes. He and his son-in-law, Dr. Evelyn O’Leary,
were on a visit here when he died.
Mrs. Vaiben Solomon, of Ash Grove, Toorak (Vic.),
has been made a J.P. by our Government. This
gives her no legal authority in Victoria, but enables
her to act for visitors from S. Aus. who want one
of their own J’s.P. on the spot. The lady is the
widow of a former Premier of ours.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
The Company has been formed for the purpose of establishing
a chain of woollen mills throughout Australia; each mill to under-
take one or more of the particular processes of woollen or worsted
manufacture. It is intended that Amalgamated Textiles (Australia),
Ltd., will manufacture, not only for consumption within our own
land, but also for export abroad—such export will be principally
confined to wool tops, scoured wool, carbonised wool and blankets.
This chain system of specialising in manufacture has long since
appealed to and been adopted by English millowners.
During recent years Australia has made marked progress in
the Woollen Manufacturing Industry, and yet to-day statistics show
the position to be economically bad, in that during the year
1920-1921 Australian mills were able to manufacture only approxi-
mately 25 per cent, of our requirements in woollen and worsted
piece goods.
The Provisional Directors of Amalgamated Textiles (Aus-
tralia), Ltd., are of opinion that the time has arrived when
Australia must take immediate action to eliminate a position that
forces her to ship her wool, plus grease and dirt, 12,000 miles,
let others add to the value of it, and then buy back about 75 per
cent, of her textile requirements at a price over which she has no
control.
The following figures give food for serious thought:—
The value of the Australian wool clip in
1919-1920 was £46,000,000 0 0
The value of material manufactured by Aus-
tralian woollen mills in 1919-1920 was 3,290,511 0 0
As regards the local market, the importer of textiles finds a
very profitable outlet for his goods in spite of the heavy duty,
amounting to 30 per cent, on British and 45 per cent, on foreign
materials. This duty, together with freight, insurance, exchange
and other charges, gives the Australian manufacturer an estimated
protection of 40 per cent, and 50 per cent, respectively.
It is estimated that £lOO,OOO will be required to erect, equip
and carry on a modern Worsted Mill, but as an enormous national
undertaking like Amalgamated Textiles (Australia), Ltd., must
take time to put into complete operation, it has been decided that
immediately 100,000 shares have been subscribed the Company
will proceed to lay down its first mill—a weaving and finishing
plant for the manufacture of high-grade worsted piece goods—
thereby insuring shareholders’ money being profit-earning from the
time it is subscribed.
The return from a weaving and finishing plant, based on a
yearly output of 500,000 yards of high-grade worsted material,
would be:—

Balance, being estimated net profit on one year’s
trading, is therefore . - . . . . £20,708 0 0
Equivalent to 20.7 per cent, on paid-up capital.
(The above statement has been carefully checked
by a well-known and experienced woollen manu-
facturer, and the Provisional Directors hold his
certificate verifying the figures mentioned.)
The Directors have made provision which will enable them
to select the Company’s general manager from a number of gentle-
men whose qualifications are undoubted, and who, apart from
their wide experience in the industry abroad, all have the added
advantage of a thorough knowledge of Australian conditions.
The Provisional Directors are in communication with a gentle-
man in England who has had a wide experience in the manufacture
of woollen and worsted goods, and who has agreed to act there in
an advisory capacity.
The Memorandum and Articles of Association have been
framed in accordance with the regulations of the Stock Exchange,
and perused by the Secretary. Application will later on be made
to have the shares listed.
No consideration, either in the form of cash, paid-up shares,
or otherwise, is being given to the Promoters.
No Contracts have been entered into by the Provisional
Directors.
Prospectuses and Application Forms can be obtained from
the Secretary.

SURE CATCH TACKLE
David has restored the ancient reputa-
tion of the Australian thoroughbred. During the
A.J.C. Easter meeting this Australian of the third
generation galloped 7i miles, won three races and
was beaten a neck in the fourth, manifestly because
he needed the gallop. In his last exploit he took
on the four best staying three-year-olds and the Mel-
bourne Cup winner in the A.J.C. Plate, made nearly
allhis own running and beat them pointless in 3min.
58jsec. for the 18 furlongs—and the going was on the
heavy side. The farther they travel the better
David likes it, in which respect he differs from
99 per cent, of the progeny of imported stock. Like
the grand old Australian horses of a past that knew
not squibby English sires, the black son of
Baverstoek-Linotype improves with age and racing.
and is a better horse
at the end of a gruel-
ling meeting than at
the start. A great
stayer with a great
heart and legs like
steel, he has proved
himself worthy to be
ranked with Malua,
Trenton, Merman, Aber-
corn, Wallace and
Trafalgar. Yet because
of the craze for im-
ported stuff he was
knocked down at the
1918 yearling sales for
40 guineas.
J. WA RREN
WHITE, chair-
man of the V.R.C.
stipendiary
stewards.
The A.J.C. Plate showed that there is very little
difference between Rivoli and The Cypher over a
journey. Rivoli finished a neck ahead, but the other
had done all the battling. Sir Andrew, the A.J.C.
St. Leger winner, was never in the hunt. But up to
a mile and a quarter, which is probably as far
as he cares to go with a good weight up, Whittier
is decidedly the fastest three-year-old. The Woorak
colt had poor luck in both his races. When he ran
in the Doncaster he was a bit above himself, and then
Brown made his task impossible by bringing him
out too soon. Ridden with any sort of judgment in
the All-Aged Stakes the bonny brown must have won.
But the stable jockey completed a saddening exhibi-
tion of horsemanship by letting Whittier bear out
when he had the race in his keeping and giving
Purser a lucky run on the rails. There was some very
rotten riding at Randwick during the round. Race
after race was thrown in the air, and not only by
apprentices and known third-raters. Even pilots
with first-class reputations were guilty of stupid
blunders, such as trying to win from the three-
furlong post—a feat only possible at Randwick when
the horse has exceptional stamina or exceptional
speed. But nothing was more lamentable than the
oerformanee on Whittier in the All-Aged Stakes.
Although King Carnival failed in the Sires’ Produce
Stakes, after being ridden into the ground, he is a
more likely-looking Derby colt than The Monk, who
won. The Monk is by Absurd-Cowl, and Absurd
horses seldom stay. It is the same with Tressady’s
offspring, but Rahiri, one of the Tressadys, was fin-
ishing at a great bat in both his races, and may
prove more trustworthy than the ill-remembered
Strathredole. Black Scot was a dreadful disappoint-
ment. After the Sires’ Produce and the Champagne
Stakes excuses were made for him, but in the eight-
furlong Second Nursery, won by Quintus, he had every
chance, only to be beaten out of a place. Ridden
in the hell-for-leather style, Quintus (Valais-Desmine)
was fading at the end of six furlongs in the
Breeders’ Plate, but, nursed for a final run, he out-
stayed the opposition in the Second Nursery and tnay
go the Derby distance. Erie Connolly’s All Black colt
All Sunshine is a nice bit of stuff that is certain to
improve; and Trilisa, winner of the Breeders’ Plate,
has any amount of pace. But it is improbable that
she will stay.
Horses trained and owned in Victoria won 11 of
the 26 races run at the meeting. J. R. Corteen,
owner of Purser, and Cecil Godby, who trains the
animal, had two royal wins, and Darcy Eccles (The
Cypher and Quintus) and Eric Connolly (Fleuriste)
must have been well ahead of it when the curtain
fell. The only unpleasant incident of the round was
the analysing of saliva from Fleuriste’s mouth after
the horse had won the Flying Handicap. It proved
to contain no trace of dope, and Connolly is indig-
nant for two reasons: (1) because he was suspected
and (2) because he didn’t receive a swab for inde-
pendent analysis—he was certainly entitled to that.
In the abstract, big punters are of doubtful utility
to the turf, but Connolly has certainly given the pub-
lic a fair spin. Nothing could be more open and
aboveboard than the way he ran out Rostrum and
Fleuriste at Randwick in the Spring. The sale of
the English horse for 500 guineas also excited re-
mark. But Fleuriste is no champion, and is well
up in the weights; and after his showing in the
Rous Handicap on Saturday it is not so certain that
Connolly “simply gave him away.”
* * * *
“0.K.” : Seven to one about Mufti (s.p.)
for the Dangar Handicap, last Saturday, was surely
a good bet, seeing that the mare had an established
reputation for staying well in heavy going. Mufti is
an unrobust mare who feels the benefit of every small
reduction in weight, and at 7st. 121 b., or 21b. less
than her Sydney Cup burden, she seemed to have a
big pull over Purser (9st. 101 b.), who has shown no
partiality for dirt. Purser was carrying only a
light weight in the Caulfield Cup of 1921 when the
heavy going enabled Violoncello to beat him.
* * * *
“Whitehall”: The Prince’s win last week,
at Hawthorn Hill, in the Welsh Guards Cup, is
probably the most meritorious of his career as an
amateur horseman. Hawthorn Hill racecourse, which
is on the original estate of the Hares of Bracknell
(a Sydney daily, by the way, mentioned that he had
ridden Bracknell!), has made fences which are bigger
than those of Sandown, where the coveted Grand
Military event is run. A good class of animal turns
out at the annual Household Brigade meeting, at
Hawthorn Hill, the riders in the six events comprising
some of the wealthiest young men in the kingdom.
The humblest of their mounts are thoroughbreds that
have hunted with the fast Brigade Drag, and some
are of Grand National class.
* * * *
The main features of the annual Onka-
paringa meeting in the hills behind Adelaide were
a record totalisator, a probably record crowd and
the fourth win of Doiran in the Great Eastern
Steeplechase. Immensely popular, he was received
with general cheers on going out, and the over-
worked term “ovation” was for once appropriate
when he finished. The ancient was backed down to
3 to 2 in a field of 13, carried 12st. 71b. and won
easily. But the Oakbank fields are not as strong
as they used to be when Victorian ’chasers made a
point of going across.
* * * #
“Kop”: In a race at Swift’s Creek (Yic.)
the other day, De Valera, a rank outsider, romped
home from the odds-on favorite Shouldn’t Wonder.
The third horse was Kiltowyn!
* * * #
“Caesar”: For the quick-thinking event I
nominate old Jimmy Moore, well known on the Bris-
bane River years agone. Jimmy was behind the
famous Duchess in a trotting event, and was winning
easily when the traces snapped about 20 yards from
the post. Like: a flash Jimmy grabbed the mare by
the tail, and was hauled in a winner, while the grand-
stand rocked with joyous noises.
* * * *
There were more wet than dry wickets
about Sydney in 1921-22, but this season there has
been only one moist Saturday. It arrived last week,
and helped Waverley (8 for 315, innings closed)
to extinguish Mosman (142 and 3 for 97) and Gor-
don to eliminate North Sydney (288 to 108). A.
C. Lawrie (6 for 28) reaped a harvest for Gordon.
The winners are to play off for the premiership.
* * * *
“Machete”: One of the quaintest inci-
dents in the history of cricket came to an end last
week, when the N.S.W. Umpires’ Association, which
had been on strike for some weeks, decided to don
the white jackets of regular graft again. The indig-
nant old gentlemen, however, have declined to work
alongside a breakaway section which truckled to the
base employer. The trouble started because a Parra-
matta player, who had stoushed an umpire, was
awarded only a month’s suspension. In spite of
vigorous protests from the Umps, the C.A. refused to
reopen the matter. Hence the strike.
* * * *
“Snow” : Mention of old Bill Howell (B.
5/4/’23) recalls that he was often connected with
something out of the way in cricket. Originally
picked as a batsman in a Country v. City match
he was discovered as a bowler while playing for
N.S.W. against Stoddart’s team at Sydney in 1894.
The Englishmen had the bowling well collared,
when Bill remarked to the captain that “he thought
he could get one of those coves out.” He was
given a go, and was as good as his word, securing
5 wickets for 44 runs in a score of 394, all clean
bowled. Then in 1898, for N.S.W. against Stod-
dart’s second combination, he belted the bowling for
95 in less than an hour, and went in last at that.
A hit out, of the ground was only worth five in those
days or Bill would have been well over the hundred.
The old ’un was a restive onlooker at a dull inter-
state game played during the summer. “Is there
a penalty now for hitting ’em over the pickets?” he
was heard to remark.
“The Deacon”: What about this for a
country-cricket record ? L. Benaud, playing in
Nepean district (N.S.W.) matches, captured the
.vhole 20 wickets in a match. On the first Satur-
day he dismissed the opposition for 30, following
this up a week later by getting 10 for 35 ; an aver-
age of 3.25. Old Bill Howeil startled the local
, by bagging 10 wickets in one innings in
1920, but Bill never did it twice running.
* * * *
The first spasm of the struggle for the Mel-
™"lle cricket premiership attracted a crowd of
suoo, who saw some desperately slow cricket for their
money. P ran, who had snatched a victory from ’Roy in
the previous semi-final, won the toss from North, the
conquerors of Melbourne, and North’s supporters be-
f?" t 0 wiM things with their hats when Thomsom,
kills, Willis and Flewellen went for 13, 0, 6 and 2,
the board reading 4 for 48. Then Healv’s value
to his side as a defensive batsman in a tight corner
became conspicuous. Slowly he hit up runs, with
Stephens plodding along doggedly at the other end,
and, despite frequent changes of bowling, they kept
ta 3 the bell—Healy, 116 ; Stephens
47. with 4 down for 192, ’Pran’s chances look good.

“Tren”: Unique was the cricket match, at
Melbourne, between the Rankins of Geelong and the
McConehies of Richmond. The Macs won by 09
iuns (1(0—101), but they are a team in regular
practice, who, during their nine years in the Southern
Cross competition, have been five times premiers,
twice second and twice third. To the end of last
season they had won 99 out of 114 completed com-
petitive games. The Rankins, on the contrary, do
not play regularly together, so against such formid-
able opposition put up a good performance. If it
was at football well, Ted Rankin was Geelong’s
star for many years, and the best rover of his time
and his sons are both champions. Cliff was full
back in the A.I.F. Rugby team, and, now Dick Lee
has retired, is the best full forward in the Austra-
lian game; and Bert has no superior in the centre
in which position he often represents Victoria.
* * • .
“Treble”: The talk of Victoria needing
bowlers so badly that she will give promising ones
—no matter where from —a fair trial is all guff.
It it is so, why has Clarrie Grimrnett, of Prahran,
been overlooked? He has been for a long- time the
best slow-bowler in pennant cricket, yet has only
been picked once in a Sheffield Shield match, and
on that occasion, against N.S.W. in 1918-19, was
allowed to bowl only six overs. His one real chance
was against the Englishmen, and he bore the brunt
of the attack while Patsy Hendren made 271 and
Douglas 133 not out. On the shirt-front wicket suffi-
cient break to beat the bat was impossible, and as
no rabbits” came out for him to bowl over. Ins
one wicket cost 104 runs. This year he is miles
ahead of all others in pennant matches, and has
taken 63 wickets at a cost of 11.4; and was not
picked. If Arthur Mailey—who is a “rabbit-killer”
if ever there was one—-had been judged by a per-
formance against the crack batsmen of an English
team without an opportunity at the tail-enders, he
would still be a pennant cricketer and nothing more.
* * * *
International cricket for the next few
seasons is definitely scheduled in the new Wisden's
Annual. Next year South Africa visits England. At
Christmas, 1924, an England XI will be in Australia.
The next Australian XI goes on its travels in 1926.
Sydney Pardon, editor of Wisden’s, finds young Chap-
man, as Australia has just found him, “the most attrac-
tive personality in the new generation of English
players.” And he is glad that the eight-ball over
has been formally recognised by the M.C.C. for
Australian use, though “not the slightest disposition
was shown to adopt it in this country; it has not
had the least effect in Australia in checking the
excessive run-getting."- But anyway “Australians
have secured official sanction for their innovation.
Though nobody seemed to mind, their matches among
themselves for three or four seasons were not played
in accordance with the Laws of Cricket.” Austra-
lia has evidently “married the girl,” so to speak.
* * * *
“Centurion”; The Rugger international
between France and England was won by England,
12—-3. Davies, the English half-back, who inter-
rupted his honeymoon to play his final game for
England, dropped for goal, but the ball struck a
Frenchman. Catching the rebound, Davies tried
again and this time found the posts. The Austra-
lian record for a queer field goal was put up by
J. Patterson, of Queensland, against N.S.W. at
Svdjpey in 1894. Patterson, a forward, was drib-
bling through the loose, when he trod on the ball.
Some amazing chance sent it well over the cross
bar and the Northerners were credited with a field
goal. ,f%. --.,4;,...

“Leagueite”: The N.S.W. Rugby League
has been caught napping again. Last week it lost
the North Sydney ground to the Australian-rulers,
wTio offered £3OO and 20 p.c. of the net takings,
whereas £lOO and 10 p.c. net was the League’s
paltry bid. It is bad business on the League’s part to
allow the premiers to lose their ground, especially
as the Australian game and Soccer are making such
progress at the professional code’s expense. Glebe
and Newtown are also homeless. Western Suburbs,
Balmain and St. George are the only League clubs
now in possession of local grounds.
* * * *
Gerald Patterson avenged himself on
young Schlesinger at the Geelong tournament.
Schlesinger, who hasn’t yet learnt to vary his game,
drove the big fellow to 7 — -5 in the first spasm,
but only gathered two games in the next, and it was
evident from the way that Patterson was behaving
that, if the match had been extended to the inter-
national standard of the best three sets out of five,
Schlesinger’s defeat would have been even more
decisive. Hawkes proved that he has further widened
the gap between himself and Wertheim by allowing
the tall M.C.C. player two whole games in two
sets. The Geelong youth annexed one set in the
final against Patterson, but the latter was too good.
In fact, Patterson showed a welcome return to
some of his old form in the severity of his service
and the placing of some of his shorter ground shots.
It is now stated that Hawkes is willing to join the
expedition that will shortly set out for the Davis
Cup. If this is true, Australia’s strength will be
practically doubled in the singles, and the possi-
bility of this country defeating Japan and even
working into the challenge round—an eminently
desirable objective on account of the gate—doesn’t
now look so remote.
Ivid Dale, the 18-year-old Melbourne light-
weight, is not particularly fast, but he was too
tough for Jack Finney, who boxes right hand fore-
most. Finney, who drew with Jamito in his last
fight, landed lefts on the body and rights on the
jaw, but Dale kept coming in for more, and, early
in the sixth round, he sent Finney down for eight
seconds. The Sydney pug. crawled up, but was soon on
the floor again, for nine seconds this time. Again he
sank to the beards, to stay down for the count.
It wasn’t previously suspected that Dale carried a
knockout punch.
* * * *
Australia has acquired a new lightweight
champion in Harry Collins, the English-born New-
castle (N.S.W.) pug. Although beaten by the Ameri-
can Eagel in short order, he knocked out Hughie
Dwyer at Melbourne in 19 rounds. For 16 of them
Dwyer, employing defensive tactics, outboxed his
man, and then, stung by the crowd’s sarcasm, he
went in to fight. It was a disastrous manoeuvre, for
in the 18th round Collins felled him twice with right
swings, and when the bell sounded for the 19tn
canto Dwyer was too dazed to keep away. A right
on the chin ended the business, leaving Collins
champion and Dwyer under the dreadful suspicion
that he owns a glass jaw.
* * * «
“Push Off”: In Doyle (14), Barrett (16),
,Stuart (16) and Charlton (15) Sydney owns four
remarkable boy-swimmers. Charlton has proved him-
self, and according to Harris, the man from Honolulu,
will beat all-comers over a journey at the Olympic
Games next year, but
the other nippers have
yet to compete against
the topnotchers. Doyle
is a freak; though a
child in years, he is
6ft. tall and weighs
over 11 stone. He de-
feated Barrett and
Stuart for the State
junior title, but his
victims have since
notched better times.
Barrett dead-heated
with George Proudfoot
for the supremacy of
the Pyrmont club,' get-
ting over 100 3'ards
in 61sec., and on
Saturday he swam 60
yards in 24 4-ssec.
Stuart has twice cov-
ered the hundred inside
a minute. His stroke
is perfect, and he has
just the right tempera-
ment for competition
swimming.

A proud man was Darcy Donkin when
Greyhound won the N.S.W. motor-boat pennant The
success rubbed some of the sting off Donkin’s dis-
qualification at Adelaide. Miss Aussie was the Grey-
hound s only serious opponent (Miss Brisbane and
Miss Sydney broke down), but Donkin’s craft streaked
away comfortably over che concluding end of the
20-mile journey. Greyhound covered the course in
31mm. 32sec., and Miss Aussie did it in 3Smin.

for further matches.

“F.A.” : Appo, who chopped the State
championship out of a 15in. hardwood log at Sydnev
"*ow, is a Maori who has never seen the
Wmdy fFs- His pa arrived on the Tweed River
(N.S.W.) before the advent of the mightv hewer.
But there are any number of axemen in Australia
who can clip seconds off the big fellow’s time The
£l5 offered as prize-money by the R.A.S. was not
reckoned 'sufficient inducement by first-class men,
many of whom were hewing for bigger money in
their own districts. For instance, Amos Murrill won
a £lOO prize at Wauchope (N.S.W.) on the dav
that Appo annexed his 15 notes in Sydney, Wood-
chopping is both spectacular and useful, and when
the R.A.S. wakes up to this and offers a worth-while
prize the chopping competitions will be a feature
of the big Easter gathering. No M.L. or Westralian
axeman will come to Sydney on the off-chance of
winning a £l5 prize.
* * * *
After the solemn preliminaries customary
on these occasions, Jim Paddon and Darcy Hadfield
have each deposited £lOO to bind their match for
the sculling title. The affair will take place over
the Woodburn (Richmond River) course on a date
to be fixed.

A strong team of bowlers came from Bris-
bane to Sydney for the inter-State matches and re-
turned triumphant. The Victorians took a match
from them and so did N. S'. Wales, but not before
the Queenslanders had won the rubber by inflicting
two defeats on the Mother State. They were an
excellent side in every department of the game, and
Tom Bouchard, one of their skippers, is quite first-
class. _ His four twice defeated Billy Alderson’s, and
Billy is the Ma State’s best.

THE INKY WAY.
Flown West, T. H. Bird, of Queensland's Hansard
staff. Besides a son and two daughters he left a
father, aged 83, who was proved guilty, years ago,
of being the author of “The Early Days of Rock-
hampton.’’
“Te Pana”: Christchurch newspapers are the
first in M.L. to make a move towards the pre-war
price of their sheets. They are now ljd. to regular
subscribers, although the man in the street still
pays tuppence a time.
“Jacky Roo” (Lond.): A mighty inky wayfarer
was Lord Dalziel, who has just retired after ,30
years’ work in Fleet-street. At 16 he was writing
leaders for a small Scottish paper; at 18 London
editor of a Scottish daily. At 23 he became M.P.
for Kirkcaldy, and had been its representative until
the other day. His controlling interests in Daily
Chronicle, Lloyd’s News, Reynolds’s, Pall Mall
Gazette and the Era have been disposed of.
“Stellsby”: The Arous is sore over Acting-Premier
McPherson's “City Square” proposal. Among its
other objections, it fears that, should we some day,
get a Socialistic City Council, the Collins-street square
would blossom into a forum where the noble rage
of cranks and demagogues would be irrepressible.
But there is just a suspicion that the Argus regrets
its premature grabbing at a site for its new offices
at the northern end of Elizabeth-street, when with
a little more foresight, it might have secured a
choice position in Collins-street, in the neighborhood
of “the business centre of Australia.”
“Wilfrido”: The Turnbull Library (M.L.) has
been described as the finest private collection south
of the Line. The late A. H. Turnbull specialised
in the literature of Australia and Maoriland. Apropos
of the recent purchase by the Australian Government
of the Captain Cook manuscripts in London, there
is in the Turnbull Collection a copy of the Dolphin’s
log from June, 1766, to June, 1768, but it is appa-
rently the work of Captain Wallis, who was in
charge of the boat, and is signed by him. A copy
of one log kept on the Endeavour between December,
1768, and June, 1770 —it is not known by whom —
is also in the collection, together with various
manuscript letters of Cook’s.
“Horton”: La Li3Re Belgique was not the only
paper clandestinely published in Belgium during
the German occupation. There was one other; Du
Vlaamsche Leeuw (“The FTemish Lion”). It was
printed in a Brussels cellar, and secretly distributed
among the hopfields and villages. Lacking the
brilliancy of the Walloon paper, it was at least
an evidence that not all the FTemish were pro-German
in their sympathies. Those Diggers who paid through
the neck for souvenir copies of La Libre Belgique
during their stay in the Charleroi district probably
know by now that they were re-prints foisted cn
them by enterprising publishers; but if anyone has
a copy of De Vlaamsche Leeuw it’s odds on
that it’s genuine.
“Pedro”: There was once a club whose members
were high among the headiest professional and about-
town men in Sydney, and did all the things that the
amateur high-rollers who love to call themselves
Bohemians would be afraid to do. One night a
group of them had been doing some of those th'ngs
with bottles and glasses, and then sallied out. They
brought up at the coffee-stall in front of the Herald
office, an American visitor among them. In those
days the captain of that stall was an old party
whose manners were as venerable as his years. The
American was greatly impressed. Yes, said the
boys, but that was only what you would expect. For
this pile before him in the hour when churchyards
yawn was the Herald office; the chief proprietor of
the Herald was Mr. James; he was so wrapped up
in the welfare of his staff that he insisted upon tak-
ing personal charge of this wayside cafe where they
ate; and he was the venerable old <ren'leman whom
the visitor saw before him. “ Jee-hoshaphat! ” said
the Yankee, “ain’t this the greatest country on the
map!”
“P.A.L.”: Handed in his last slip of copy at
Wellington (M.L.), Fred. K. Reeves. Astonishing
energy was tucked away in his small body—you
could almost see it dripping from his fingertips
as with inseparable gamp, everlasting pipe in mouth,
and quick elastic step he trotted from the Post to
do his Parliamentary rounds. But two or three
decades of intense activity seemed to burn the life-
blood out of poor Reeves, and then ill-health laid
distressing hands on him. I shall always think of
him as the foster-father of many an inky-way nest-
ling. His kindly severity to the callow youths has
helped to make many a steady pressman in M.L.
to-day. I remember his advice to me when once,
years back, I left to seek fame in Sydney. I recol-
lect every word of it as he whispered it in his
staccato little voice over the gangway: “Be quick
to gauge the altered perspective. Always remember
that the man whose duty it is to tell you what to
do knows more than you do —if he doesn't he is
paid for it, and you are not paid for arguing with
him. Never discuss with other men the faults of
those above you. This is not only common-sense but
charity. If you succeed send me a letter. If you
strike rough weather send me a letter once a week,
postage unpaid, until you do succeed. And now
goodbye, and my blessing go with you every inch
of the way.” How could one forget a man like that?
“Pedro”: Certain young barristers, according to
“P.P.J.” (B. 29/3/’23), take briefs and get not a
penny for their work, but are glad to do it for the
sweet uses of advertisement. The more reason why
young Costs should join the other branch of the gent,
profession, become a solicitor, and make money out
of fake libel suits —as so many do. It is too true
that every day every newspaper publishes one or
more libels. There are certain solicitors who make
it their business to watch for these, and start specu-
lative actions thereon; and as the people alleged
to be libelled are usually straw men it pays the
paper better to settle the case out of court than to
fight a stone-broker ‘ who couldn’t pay costs if he
lost. I remember a case of this kind in which Sydney
Daily Telegraph was writted when Watkin Wynne
was general manager. It looked rather a bad thing
for the paper, but presently Wynne came to his news
editor and with wreathed smiles announced that he
had settled the whole thing for £3O. “But that’s
pretty cheap, isn’t it?” said the news editor. “Well,
of course it is,” Wynne replied ; “and I said so to
the solicitor. But he said to me, ‘Well, you know,
Mr. Wynne, I’ve had a good many transactions of
this kind with you and you’ve always treated me
white, so I thought I’d put this one into you cheap.’ ”
“But what will the plaintiff say about it?” asked
Wynne. “What’s he got to do with it?” the shark
rapped back, “except about a fiver, it’s not his
money! ”
“Haka”: Three years ago, in an attempt to do
my literary bit for Maoriland, I published a book
of epigrams. Some of my critics assured me that
they were not epigrams, but merely a play upon
words. However, three weeks ago I bought a book
of epigrams by Walter Pulitzer, who, according to
London Sketch, “stands head and shoulders above
other American writers of epigram.” Here are a
few of the illustrious Yankee’s epigrams, accom-
panied by my plays upon words. In each case I
place Walter in the lead: —
“Too often, gilt-edged security is just guilt-
edged.”
“Beware of the man who offers you a guilt-edged
security.”
“One thing that always carries its face value —a
kiss.”
“A bought complexion will always bring its face
value.”
“Drink, and the world drinks with you. Settle
the bill, and you settle alone.”
“Spend, and the world drinks with you. Save and
it wants a loan.”
“Where there’s a man’s will there’s a woman’s
way—to break it.”
“Where there’s a man’s will there’s a woman’s
won’t.”
The only point I want to make is that if ever the
world's epigrammatic championship is run in Maori-
land, Uncle Samuel should be debarred from enter-
ing Walter Pulitzer.


THere is No Loss ojf Power
with A
ICcTOSCTIC FttYtYl and General Purpose Tractor
NOTE by the diagram below how the CASE Engine
is mounted crosswise on the frame, allowing the
use of plain Spur Gears, which transmit the power
DIRECT to the wheels. This arrangement ensures
delivery of maximum power at the drawbar. The belt
pulley being on the crankshaft is in plain view, and allows
the operator to line up and back into the belt with the
greatest ease by use of the Tractor’s regular transmission.
The CASE Tractor Has No Right Angle Drive!
We will gladly
send you catalog
and booklets.
Sign and send the
corner slip to-day.
Another important result of the engine being placed crosswise is that the rear
axle is in one piece, resulting in great rigidity and strength, and also having
the effect of allowing the two back wheels to be easily locked. This feature
enables the CASE to operate in soil of a soft, slippery nature—if one wheel
slips the CASE Tractor will still go on.
Give us an opportunity of explaining to you many other superior features
which go to make the CASE the Tractor for Australian Farms.

country in order that a fearfully expensive
wife may have 10-o-vely times in town. She
otherwise interests herself by fascinating
hubby’s dearest friend, a poet, who finds his
pet ideal of womanhood in this highly un-
satisfactory matron. That the lady may ter-
minate her unfortunate marriage with him-
self, and then elevate his friend the poet to
rhe throne of her affections, is the literary
Grossmith’s secret wish. Therefore, by way
of inciting her to divorce, he lavishes nis in-
come on her. Meanwhile, his wife’s cousin,
a gushful maiden of 18, reveals a wondrous
talent, both for illustrating Grossmith’s
tawdry novels and for cooking beef and
Yorkshire pudding, whereas her manner of
setting her young cap at the hard-working
philosopher reveals no genius at all. The
fifth figure in this strange eventful history
is an aviator, who lives in military uniform
with medals on his breast, with a view to
earning a character for irresistibility, and a
consequent notoriety as co-re. in divorce
suits. The incredible wife of the novelist
chooses to be suspected by the poet of frailty
at the fiat of the aviator, which shatters his
dream of fair womanhood for the time being.
In fact, she accuses herself, in the presence
of the poet and her liege lord, but in the
absence of the flying man, whose interest in
the lady has already ceased, owing to her
having confessed privately to him that her
sole object in life was to get quit of the
indulgent husband who paid her bills, and
marry the blind poet who persisted in ideal-
ising instead of hugging her. Grossmith
somehow persuades himself to get the divorce
during an interval between Acts 2 and 3,
after which the lady artist, in her teens,
forsakes art for matrimony (with Mr. G.,
of course), terminating her career as
draughtswoman by painting a study in the
nude, which she calls “Inspiration” instead
of “Naked Untruth.” The coast is now clear
for the expensive divorcee to restore confi-
dence and ideals in the mind of her late hus-
band’s faithful Mend, the poet.

Cosmo Hamilton, an evident collector of
humorous “gags,” is billed as author of an
oddly farcical comedy that could have been
vastly improved upon by Bernard Shaw.
Still, for all its gross misrepresentations of
human nature in brainy circles, the comedy
is amusing for five-sixths of the journey, de-
spite a faulty cast. The women characters
are truthfully presented as to type by Diana
Wilson and Doris Kendal, and because she
has little to do save look and talk syrenishly
and wear charming raiment, Diana Wilson
is less unconvincing than Doris Kendal.
Doris’s part is really more difficult, because
of its transformation from damsel to wife,
and she falls deeply into the temptation to
“overdo” it. As for the men, Grossmith and
Ashton .Tarry, the husband and idealist re-
spectively, are competent actors misfitted by
their parts; but, as their parts bear no re-
semblance to possible literary fact, their mis-
fitness matters less than it would if realism
were aimed at. Paul Plunket, as fifth wheel
of the coach, is another outrage on the laws
of selection. Miss Wilson’s sinister stage
intrigue with airman Plunket is no more
reasonable than her marriage with Grossmith
what time she was adoring friend Jarry.
Nor is her adoring of Jarry dramatically
comprehensible. On the stage women are
expected to concentrate on attractive men,
but Diana Wilson’s husband, lofty lover and
alleged leader-astray haven’t a winsome smile
among them. Nor the sort of smile that, in
the words of the song, make life worth while.

With its company of five only, and but one

Evelyn Scotney was welcomed back by a
glad house at Melbourne Town Hall on
Saturday. Though she never has an abso-
lutely heavenly moment, the picturesque
soprano sings effectively, and she quickly
caught the house with a selection of Italian
and Russian titbits, mixed with English airs
of a rather restful disposition. Probably
she warbled best in the Russian bracket
which included Rachmaninoff’s peaceful
“Ecstasy of Spring” and Stravinsky’s “Pas-
torale,” a gentle melody in keeping with its
title; but the greatest applause greeted the
hoary “Caro Nome,” the effusive “O, Mio
Babbino Caro,” from Puccini’s “Gianni
Schicchi,” and the dear old “Miserere” from
“Trovatore,” delivered with the help of
Hampson Taylor and the Orpheon Choristers
under the baton of Haydyn West. None of
the items shook the Australian out of her
undramatic attitude near the piano. That
is to say, she didn’t draw heavily on her
prima-donna personality, and apparently
loved most to throw her head back and lin-
ger on a low, caressing note until the im-
patient composer moved her on. The sup-
port was distinctly second-rate. First there
was the choir aforesaid, pleasing but not
exciting, in a couple of unremarkable part
songs. Then there was the tenor, Hampson
Taylor, who rendered “M’appari tutt’ amor”
from Flotow’s “Marta” in a manner appro-
priate for idle lilts about lambkins and
daisies. His style, or lack of it, was shown
when he appealed to “pretty Jane” to spend
the evening Avith him, as if he wanted her
to take a hand at ludo or tiddly-winks.
Cecil Parkes, now too old to trade on his
departed precocity, fiddled unimpressively in
two or three standard items; but Welsford
Smithers was a capital accompanist, and
well deserved to be dragged out by the lead-
ing lady to take a homoeopathic helping of
applause.

“Bulldog Drummond,” at Melbourne
Palace, where fine new fittings are getting
purged of their smell of paint, has been toned
up in some places and toned down in others.
If it still fails to explain its great success
in more crowded cities far away, the failure
can be attributed firstly to the fact that the
melodrama supposes a universal acquaint-
ance with the novel, and secondly to the
fact that the performance does not strike the
right key loud enough at the start. Prob-
ably the very easiness of G. H. Mulcaster’s
likeable impersonation of the name character
is against its theatrical effect. Mulcaster is
pleasingly casual in his acting, but in this
pure and lurid melodrama an airy manner
carries insufficient weight. You get an open-
ing impression of an awf’ly nice sort of bloke
in a brown suit, and find it hard, if not im-
possible, to take his subsequent deeds of
audacity seriously, notAvithstanding his en-
gaging naturalness. The personality is not
strong, the cheery heroism fails to thrill,
almost as utterly as Eve Gray fails in her
opening appeal for help. To remember the
vibrant tones of the unhappy heroine who
appealed to Sherlock Holmes of yore is to
feel sorry for the yellow-haired girl who
calls on Bulldog Drummond. Charle’s Road
Night should extract a little of the venom
from some of the threatening speeches he
spits at most people, whereas more pep
should be imparted to the bogus policemen
Avho steal the boss villain away and leave
Drummond to explain the corpse of the
Mephistopheles he has choked.

A. A. Milne’s “Stepmother” and Harold
Chapin’s “Art and Opportunity” were given
a hearing by the Mermaid Play Society at
the Melba Hall, Melbourne, last week. The
first-named is a flimsy one-acter which is
only suspected of satirical intentions when
it breaks off in a note of interrogation regard-
ing the little problem it refuses to solve.
Edith Fraser did pretty well as a resource-
ful English lady confronted by the appari-
tion of her husband’s illegitimate son. The
latter character was played by Allan Murray,
who adopted a false Repertory tone unsuit-

able for an apparent waster in distress. “Art
and Opportunity,” which is not unlike
Milne’s “Belinda” in its readiness to dissemi-
nate the author’s delusions regarding the
feminine intelligence, was right in the hands
of Melbourne’s original Belinda, Mrs.
Apperly, who delivered a clever widow’s senti-
ments with the almost mechanical readiness
of a penny-in-the-slot. She was “too quick
on the draw,” so to speak, to dissipate the
impression that she was only revelling in the
verbal felicities of her part. Helton Daniell’s
usually matter-of-fact style was derailed by
his preposterous position as a love-stricken
nobleman, while Norman Simpson, as an-
other blue-blooded nincompoop, Avas stiff and
doleful. Russell Gourlay played Algernon
very well; Norman Mitchell was fair as
Henry Bentley; and Mary Curtain was
humorously rugged as the hard-tongued Lady
O’Hoyle.

“Lucky Durham” came to light at Mel-
bourne Playhouse on Saturday, and Victor
Fitzherbert, as the shiftless Lord Mount-
fallon, suffered the double humiliation of see-
ing his ancestral home torn from him by his
illicit son and then restored at the instance
of the young man’s mamma. A later genera-
tion is apparently superior to the false
pathos of the old Wilson Barrett play, for
there were isolated bursts of mirth on Satur-
day where in earlier times a respectful atti-
tude could be expected. Little interest, how-
ever, lies in the current revival, unless it is
interesting to find Nellie Bramley again out-
dressing her company in a secondary charac-
ter who has to leave a lot of the stage to
Guy Hastings, munificently writing out
cheques as if they were orders for small
domestic supplies. Hastings, as a million-
aire, is just the thing. He expresses the
downright contempt for money which only a
Wall-street Napoleon can afford to feel.
All eyes are turned on “Yellow Men and
Gold,” at Melbourne Majestic this week. It
is the tale of a treasure hunt with plenty of
blud supplied by two shiploads of supers on
murder bent. At the same house “Three
Pals” gives the short, uneventful history of
two kids and a dog. The past, present and
future in movie production are airily chal-
lenged by Hoyt’s “Fall of Babylon,” a mag-
nificent spectacle, but wanting a coherent
story and attractive human interest. Hoyt’s
customers are probably more touched by the
appearance of Dorothy Dalton as a Sussiety
beauty, alone with two men “On the High
Seas.” The onick and the dead are con-
spicuous in “Without Compromise” at the
Melba, William Farnum bemg at large in a
primeval part. “Betsy’s Burglar” is visible
at the Britannia, and Betsy (Connie Tal-
madge) is all the rage.
“Madame Butterfly” hasn’t desisted from
harrowing the flappers Avho bite chocolates
at Sydney Royal, nor “French Leave” from
making repatriated warriors grin. There
are shrewd hits at the British Army system
in this comedy of a brisk war-bride in quest
of a tete-a-tete with her lord at brigade head-
quarters, where a bride shouldn’t be.
“If Winter Comes,” with Garry Marsh
as Mark Sabre and Muriel Martin-Harvey
as the ill-starred Effie, continues to interest
readers of the novel at Sydney Royal. The
newcomers are supported by some clever
Australian people, notably Leslie Victor and
George Blunt. And the low-comedy stuff
is in capable hands —those of Georgia Har-
vey and little Lorna Helms.
No change is reported in the condition of
“Sally” at Her Majesty’s, where
that storied river the Schnitza Komisski
flows melodiously to the sea. It has been
doing the thing nightly since January 6, Sun-
days and Good Friday excepted.
At Sydney Palace, Lauder is confiding to
audiences which are easily seduced into Dom-
ing in the chorus that he loves a lassie, and
that’s the reason noo he wears a kilt; also
that she is his Rosie, his wee Annie, his
bonnie, bonnie Jean —in fact, he’d rather
lose his spurs than lose his Daisy. After
extricating himself from this embarrassment
of Scotch tabbies, he gives masterly, imita-
tions of a distracted baker and a sentimental
man-o’-warsman, The non-Lauder part of
the programme maintains its unremarkable
level. Probably out of consideration for the
star, no one has yet shot the man who plays
tne cornet.

At Sydney Town Hall on Saturday even-
ing Gerardy will give the first of his con-

Sydney Tivoli has a varied assortment in
the current programme. The newest arrival,
Vera Benson, is a warbler of pleasing melo-
dies, who would do better if she let us know
what she was singing about. Togo, the Jap
juggler, keeps a kitchen-full of utensils spin-
ning in the air, and makes a great display
in his six-sticks juggling act. La Ventura
continues to bewilder the eye in her colorful
transformation acts. Oswald Bemand’s
white pigeons obey their master with the
promptitude of a Boche in front of a Pots-
dam s’major. And the Southern Singers,
the Akaba'h Arabs and Gus McNaughton and
Jesse Sweet, his partner, carry on each in
his fashion.
Sydney film-flappers are . giving the
Lyceum’s “Silent Voice” pride of place
this Aveek in the Shadow Stakes. The
flapper’s brother, however, plumps for
the other film at this house, “Yellow Men
and Gold.” At the Strand Jack Holt and
Dorothy Dalton go gallivanting “On the
High Seas.” They endure a fire at sea and
two wreckages, and are landed high and dry,
only to take ship on the equally uncertain
ocean of matrimony. The Empress and Rialto
present “The Ladder Jinx,” the story of a
superstitious maiden, and “Timothy’s Quest,”
which has a pull on sensitive heartstrings.
Hoyt’s stock of rough-and-readies shows no
sign of diminishing. Current releases in-
clude Bill Russell in “The Great Night” and
Hoot Gibson in “Ridin’ Wild.” At the
Globe pretty Mae Murray is fascinating as
“Broadway Rose,” and at the Crystal Palace
Mary Pickford keeps her curly head up as
“Tess of the Storm Country.”
First-class variety shows are Adelaide's
present dissipation. “The Girl for the Boy,"
at the Royal, is little more than one, though
the turns are neatly welded together, mainly
by the skill of Miss Lee White, to whom
Clay Smith plays up handsomely. Other
clever people get their chances, and the
dancing is good. A new-to-Australia revue
is just being put on. At the Prince of Wales
the Musgrove eo. relies on the mid-air feats
of Wells and Dells, the chalk effects of Paddy
Saunders, the dancing of Moon and Morris,
and (latterly) the fooling of the two. Ceaiks.
Meanwhile the Majestic continues Avith Fred
Bluett, the enchanted forest of Klicks and
the musical comedy co. of Jim Gerald. But
Hugh Huxham’s Serenaders have at last
closed their open-air sittings after a long,
dry summer, for which they should be duly
thankful. At the Town Hall are the Sis-
tine soloists, about Avhom Adelaide was, after
its usual custom, cold at starting, but en-
thusiastic at the finish.
“Second Murderer”: I went to our sub-
urban palace to see a film version of “A
Woman of No Importance,” wondering bow
the perdoocer could juggle a reasonably in-
teresting movie out of Oscar Wilde. He
has done the trick, however, although the
sub-titles make a quaint shandygaff. Not
that our audience minds; an epigram or a
telegram is all the same to us. What we
yearn for is lots of muddle ending in cuddle.
But the acting was delightful. Fay Comp-
ton as the Woman was a convincing per-
sonality. This lady has been recently placed
first in a newspaper estimate of the best
six mummers in the U.K. She is a radiant
creature with glorious red hair, and can and
does act anything, stepping from Peter Pan
to Caesar’s Wife with ease and distinction.
She has lately married one of the Quarter-
maines, and that makes her third sprint to
the altar. Her first experiment was Harry
Gabriel Pelissier, creator of The Follies.
No. 2 was Laurie de Freece. Fay’s father,
Edward Compton, showed London at the St.

“0.K.” lays a contemporary to rest: —
Last week’s notices of Sarah Bernhardt, with their
repeated allusions to her greatness as an actress and
a citizen, reminded me of something I once said
impulsively to a stranger seated beside me at the
little Garrick Theatre, London. The curtain was just
falling on the second act of “Lady Frederick,” in
which Ethel Irving had been stung to fury by the
other woman’s insults. I said to my neighbor,
“Sarah Bernhardt never acted like that!" He
admitted rather grudgingly that Lady Frederick’s
outburst had taken him by surprise, considering that
Miss Irving had been playing secondary parts in musi-
cal comedy.
From my British point of view—and no man can
fully appreciate histrionic art save in his native tongue
—Bernhardt never acted like Ethel Irving at her best.
How she may have appeared to French folk, able
to follow every word and nuance of intonation in
her rapid utterance —so rapid that she was rarely
quite intelligible to the average Britisher who
“speaks French”—l know not. I speak of the much-
travelled Bernhardt, famous in England, America,
and other English-speaking countries long before she
came to Australia in 1891, and drawing with her
name a public which for the most part understood
hardly a word that she or her company uttered.
Herself was the hardest of the lot to follow, though
her gestures, of course, were most expressive. Of
Bernhardt’s work in the half-dozen plays she staged
in Australia my recollection is that she scored her
chief artistic success as Camille, the consumptive
courtesan, and Theodora, the highly improper empress.
Her Cleopatra, in Sardou’s drama of that name, was
distinctly less of a regular royal Egyptian queen
than we had looked for. The fact was she suited
every character to her personality, and played, ns
far as one could understand the performance, for
broad effects, rather than for subtle appeal to our
foreign understanding.
The force of her personality was as unquestionable
as the charm of her voice. For 32 years the picture
of Bernhardt standing with outstretched arms on the
stage of Melbourne Princess’s, in response to a roar
of welcome, has remained vivid in my memory. She
was then 46 at the most, plumper far and more
seductively graceful than the Sarah who first took
London by storm, and wonderfully magnetic on
account of—as I afterwards learned —her exceedirig
nervousness. She had never been so nervous as on
this first night of her appearance before an Aus-
tralian audience, we were told. When she spoke
she was bewitching. The “golden drone” was all
it had been alleged to be. Her incidental comments
and pleased remarks were caresses. I heard a man
of limited means protest in all sincerity that he’d
like to give Bernhardt a fiver to talk to him for
10 minutes whilst he smoked a cigar. But neither
her voice, nor her personality, nor her love and
death scenes, explained the financial success of Sarah’s
visit to Australia, a risk taken by Abbey and Grau
by arrangement with the old Williamson firm.
She was not, in my reckoning, so wonderful in
acting as superlative in self-advertisement. She
had been more talked about for 20 years than any
contemporary actress. If I was not familiar with
the name of Sarah Bernhardt previous to the out-
break of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, I cer-
tainly ate numerous paragraphs about her soon after
' the establishment of the Third Republic. Her exceed-
ing thinness became a standard theatrical joke.
Sarah’s tame tiger pup, Sarah’s amateur sculptur-
ing and Sarah’s coffin were written of in all Paris
letters to London papers in the early ’seventies. I smiled
to read the other day that Sarah’s coffin had been
lying in readiness for 30 years. Why, it must be
considerably more than 40 years since we were told
of the lady having received a press interviewer whilst
she lay in her coffin —presumably the same rosewood
casket wherein she was buried last week. When
there was nothing else to do in the way of notoriety,
she gave a display of fireworks with her temper, like
many other stage and platform artists. She made
a specialty of profusion in money matters. Often-
times the 100 sovereigns piled up beside her break-
fast plate every morning of her Abbey-Grau tour
were spent in calling attention to her extravagance.
On the last morning of her stay in Sydney she
lavished more than £3O on toys for the hotelkeeper’s
little daughter. But there was a lot of business
method in Divine Sarah’s madness.
A hundred pounds a performance, with contingen-
cies which brought her Australian income up to
a considerably higher figure, was a very good holiday
payment in 1891. Had Sarah’s hereditary Jewishness
been more civilised she would doubtless have died
rich in spite of her gaudy expenditure. But she
was of Romany extraction; the gipsy was in her
blood and in her eccentricities of diet. Who but
a gipsy would have eaten 12 hard-boiled eggs whilst
conducting a morning rehearsal of a play? A
wonderful woman, and in nothing more wonderful
than in her capacity for doing the things that one
ought to do to get talked about, and leaving undone
the things that don’t matter for advertisement pur-
poses.
“Norbell”: “The Mug” (B. 5/4/’23)
doubts if 30 years have slipped by s.nce
Julius Knight first stormed in Australia.
To be exact, it is 32 years. As thus:
Melbourne Royal, “The Dancing Girl,” July
22, ’9l; “Wood Barrow Farm,” August 8;
“A Celebrated Case” (Knight as Lazare),
August 22; “Lost in London,” September 5.
Also, Julius was Rashleigh Osbaldistone in
“Rob Roy,” and Serafina Dell Aquilla yi
“The Fool’s Revenge,” with Bentley, in De-
cember of the same year. “The Mug” says
Knight was with Irving at the Lyceum,
1894-97. It was in ’97 that Knight broke
out here in “Prisoner of Zenda” and “Sign
of the Cross.” But why blame poor Henry
Irving and Alfred Lord Tennyson for
cramping Julius’s style? After all, the man
did shine in meaty, bellow stuff quite fis
effulgently as if he had been trained in the
coldly-classical school of transpontine melo-
drama.
Agnes G. Murphy’s view of it:—
Poverty Pointers, the Herald, the Son and others
have lately been discussing whether Amy Castles's
voice is that very rare thing, a pure dramatic
soprano, or a phenomenal mezzo. The Bulletin’s
Sundry Showman plumped' for the Victorian as of
dramatic quality, and said Amy’s voice was compar-
able to that of the great Destinn. I side with
The Bulletin, but I go one better and say the
Castles voice is superior to that of Destinn, for che
organ of the famous Bohemian has a certain reedy
quality which is entirely lacking in the perfect
sound-box of the genial Australian. During the last
20 years I have heard all the great vocal stars of
Europe and America, and I have never heard any
dramatic soprano to approach Amy in either quality
or reserve power. Alfred Kalisch said that by tone
alone, without any physical movement whatsoever,
Amy Castles’s voice could express all the human
emotions.
“J.F.IJ.” (Loud.) : Undiscouraged by the
first-night failure of “Good Gracious, Anna-
belle,” Marie Tempest is gamely keeping it
on instead of replacing it with one of her
old-time successes, as most of the critics
“Bulldog Drummond ,”
at Melbourne Palace.
Lou Vernon as the
man who was doped.
suggested. “A first-
night audience,”
Marie says, “is
different from
others. It is essen-
tially critical, and
prides itself on the
fact. We may get
quite a different-
type of people on
other night s.”
Asked for her
opinion concerning
noisy disapproval
of plays by first-
-11 ig h t audiences,
Miss Tempest re-
plied that it was
just a question of
individual manners
and the habits of
the country. In
London it is the
custom to hiss and
boo,-and “the same
thing happens in
Australia, although,
thank goodness, it
has never been my
lot.” In America,
she says, there is
nothing of that,
sort. If people there
don’t like a play
they simply get up
and walk out. That
strikes her as being more effective than the
English method of expressing disapproval,
as well as more polite.
“Thersites”: When an imported mummer
doesn’t click in Australia, are
always eager to blame the local “support.”
“G.A.C.” (B. 5/4/’23) complains that Joseph
Coyne, with “a first-class London reputa-
tion,” was damned by incompetent female
assistance. That can’t be the whole secret
of his comparative failure, for Marie La
Varre was as slick a -farceur as Joseph him-
self. Many mummers with first-class Lon-
don reputations have missed the ’bus hqre
througn many causes, one being that they
are institutions in the Fog, and their
public there would consider it heresy to
question their Heaven-sent genius. Perhaps
Coyne struck a public here that knew nut
Joseph. Many visiting mummers have
made a do of farce here with local help,
from G. V. Brooke’s day (oh, yes, he played
farce, too), but, per contra, we have had
Idling frosts, like the London idol, John L.
Toole. In Coyne’s case a wrong ’un to
open in had much to do with his non-
success.

Both Roland Stavely and his wife were

directions given in a Yankee atrocity. In

wax and the steel; and the process of manu-
facture was meticulously illustrated. With
the whole tiling impressed on his mind the
snipe had fashioned a key, cracked a crib
and planted the swag. Something more than
a capricious censorship is needed to deliver
the Australian kid from the plague of moral
rottenness fabricated in the cinema studios
of California.
“Willie?” : The morning after the Allan
Wilkie co. did “The Merchant of Venice”
in a small South Aus. town, Wilkie was
absorbing a. soda and milk in the local bar.
A hardy toiler engaged him in conversation.
“See the play last night, mate?” Bow.vangs
asked. Wilkie replied that he had. “What-
clier think o’ the bloke who played Shylock?”
The actor-manager said that he didn’t like
to say, being the culprit himself. “Go on,”
said Bowyangs. “You don’t look much like
yer pitcher on the ’oardin’s.” He was re-
ferring to the bust of Shakspeare which
adorns the Wilkie bills.
“Whitebait”: “Snowdrop” (B. 5/4/’23)
gives Robert Sherard’g version of Wilde’s
trouble with Sarah Bernhardt over
“Salome.” Robert Ross, Wilde’s literary
executor, tells a different story. He says
that Oscar never wrote the little piece with
a view* to production, but that, when Sarah
asked him to do something for her, he jest-
ingly said he had already done so, and,
being pressed for further details, proffered
her the MSS. She Avas undoubtedly de-
lighted with it, and wanted to stage it in
London in 1892, quite ignorant of the stupid
British law which then prevented the appear-
ance of Biblical characters on the stage.
Therefore, Sarah was not altogether respon-
sible for Wilde’s disappointment. It is true
that she was reluctant to try the piece in
Paris, but that was for the very good reason
that the dialogue isn’t in a Frenchman’s
French, and sounded rather arid and halting
to her sensitive ear.
“C.R.8.”: The latest gag about Harry
Lauder is that, when he arrived in Sydney
the other day, he opened his purse to pay
for a newspaper, and a couple of moths flew
cut. This story is only half-true. What
actually happened was that only one flew
out. Starved by his long imprisonment, he
bad eaten the other.
“Whitehall’s” so-long to a Reformer: —
Mrs. Ormiston Chant, who has just died with
hardly a word of press comment, was in the late
'nineties one of the best-known women in England.
She was the first of the Wowsers, so far as modern
London was concerned; and it must be admitted
that the Empire promenade, which was the scandal
on which she first concentrated, gave her something
to wowse about. In those days private night-clubs,
such as the Alsatians, were periodically raided by
the police in the interests of decency, yet hundreds
of ladies paraded the Empire lounges nightly—some
sober, some otherwise —amidst hundreds of young
men—most of them unsober —without any attempt
at concealment of the traffic that was going on. Mrs.
Ormiston Chant (the unforgettable name was an
asset) directed her first attack against the Empire
because, as she said, it was “the biggest and most
fashionable vice-centre in England.” She passed on
amidst a storm of abuse and derision to assault the
promenades of the smaller halls, and, though she
failed to banish the bars, she and her associates
were not long in getting rid of the ladies. Her
campaign did nothing to exterminate vice. Such
campaigns never do: they merely shift vice to another
spot—in London’s case, the streets. But she made
the West End music-halls such respectable resorts
that all classes began to patronise them, with bene-
ficent results to her old enemies the proprietors.
“Nord” : So “Mari tana” was composed in
Rowe-street, Sydney (“Bello,” B. 29/3/’23).
Years ago, when visiting the old Bush Inn
at New Norfolk (Tas.), we were assured
by the proud landlady that Wallace did the
job there —in fact, she indicated the pre-
cise spot on the balcony where he jotted
down the delightful old airs. We have ever
since thought we were standing on hallowed
flooring-boards. Another dream shattered!
“J.R.A.”: “C. Ockney’s” criticism of
Edwin Booth (B. 22/3/’23) is a libel on
that eminent actor. Booth made the mistake
of opening in London with “Hamlet” instead
of “Richelieu,” one of his most successful
plays. Irving was playing “Hamlet” at the
Lyceum, and Edwin’s Dane looked like a
direct challenge to Henry’s. About this
time there was an epidemic of Shakspearean
productions in London—lrving at the
Lyceum, Booth at the Princess’s, Warner
and Vezin at Sadler’s Wells, Rossi at Her
Majesty’s and Salvini at Covent Garden.
Booth had a fine presence, beautiful eyes
and a musical voice. His articulation was
so good that you could hear his faintest
whisper, and in the whirlwind of Ms pas-
sion he never ranted or tore it to shreds.
After his London season he played in Ger-
many, and made a great hit. No mean
achievement, for the Germans are keener
on the Bard than his own countrymen.
From an old playgoer:—
There is serious talk in London of reviving bur-
lesque, once a popular and profitable form of enter-
tainment both in England and Australia. In the
days of my youth it had a double appeal. One’s
sense of humor was catered for by a representative*
funmalcer, and the music was deftly stolen from
Gounod, Rossini, Verdi, Mozart, Balfe, Offenbach and
other famous composers. The laws of musical copy-
right were very lax in those days. Two outstand-
ing burlesques in the history of the Australian stage
are “Catching a Conspirator” and “The Happy
Land.” The former was an amusing sequel to
Barry Sullivan’s three years’ tenancy of Melbourne
Royal. He returned home by the American route,
and, landing at Cork, was promptly arrested on
suspicion of being - a Fenian expected from Yankee-
land. The incident delighted his Australian friends,
and R. P. Whitworth turned it into a happy
burlesque that ran for 100 nights. Part of
its success was due to H. R. Harwood’s lifelike
imitation of Sullivan spouting Shakspeare to the
Cork police to convince them that he was reallv
the actor-r. The original “Happy Land” was the
joint work of W. S. Gilbert and one of the A’Becketls
of London Punch. It was a diverting skit on the
political England of the period, Gladstone, Ayrton
and Robert Lowe being cleverly guyed. Marcus
Clarke did a local adaptation for a Melbourne theatre,
substituting Graham Berry, Major Smith, of Bal-
larat, and John Woods, for the British celebrities,
but the Berry Government interposed a veto. Clarke
avenged himself by having the text published in
the Age, with which he was then journalistically
associated after a violent quarrel with the Argus.
“Jacky Roo” (London) : Despite her good
looks and flawless manners, in which respect
she makes the average U.S. pitcher-tabby
look cheap, Lady Diana Manners has not
succeeded on the movies. “The Glorious
Adventure” was an ambitious but wearisome
experiment in color-photography, and “The
Virgin Queen” is just as dead. Yet Di sac-
rificed her eyebrows and wore ginger ones
to represent Shakspeare’s queen as she really
was.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Sydney shelters a mum-
mer whose meanness is notorious. Ap-
proached by an old friend with a hard-luck
story, he was all sympathy and no shekels.
“I have nowhere to sleep to-night,” the down-
nnd-outer wailed. “Don’t let that worry
you,” said the other heartily, “I’ll get you
a pass for our show.”
LOVE’S SOS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Wanted to meet Young Gentleman, view matri-
mony ; urgent. Write , care D.T. Office.”
The Springtime’s past, and the sky’s o’ercast,
Come, print this ad. for me ;
And print it quick, would you turn the trick,
And capture a mate for me.
The years slip by; my ogling eye,
Which careless men call “glad,”
Has 80-peeped all who strut or crawl,
Good, f.a.q. and bad.
But the blase sex ignores my becks,
Or stares with a sated eye;
No answering glance, no shy advance,
Rewards my suppliant sigh.
They call maids coy! Each yawning boy,
Who flaunts in his dry-cleaned suit,
Would rather a drink than a maiden’s blink,
And he’s deaf to a lover’s lute.
So bang the drum, and a man may come —-
I’m weary of wearing rue.
Just print this ad. for a likely lad,
And I want him p.d.q.

Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap is speci-
ally recommended to those suffering
with a diseased or sensitive skin. It
is invaluable when used in conjunc-
tion with Zam-Buk balm for all skin
troubles.
1/- per tablet of all Chemists.
You can t avoid accidents —they would not be accidents if you
could.
Children seem to have a special weakness for knocking or
burning their little limbs and faces and for catching any prevalent
skin or scalp disease.
No matter how careful mother may be in preparing meals or in
cleaning, she, too, cannot escape cuts, bruises and scratches.
Then there are workshop accidents that call for a pure balm
that will ensure clean, safe healing.
Zam-Buk is world renowned as a first-aid, because of its
healing, antiseptic and pain-soothing properties. These unique
qualities of Zam-Buk are derived from its herbal character and its
absolute freedom from the animal fats and minerals found in
most ointments and salves. Zam-Buk is highly concentrated, and
therefore very economical in use.

NOW AT REDUCED PRICES
Lister Patent Tension Nut, with
self-levelling Taper Crown Plate,
of which Mr. D. G. Graham, a well-known expert, wrote
on 24/4/’22: — “I have had the ‘Lister’ Tension Nut, with
Patent Self-levelling Taper Crown Plate, in use at ‘Goonoo
Goonoo,’ ‘Abbington’ and ‘Lyndhurst’ during 1920, ’2l and ’22
shearings. The work done by the machines in which this Nut
was fitted was as follows: Sheep shorn, 17,600; crutched,
24,000. This Nut has required no attention whatever since I
first put it into use.
“As an expert among shearing machines for close on 20
years 1 consider the ‘Lister’ Self-levelling Taper Crown
Plate one of the best improvements brought out in
Shearing Machines in recent years. It is a great advantage
that it can be fitted to several makes of popular handpieces,”
Other makes of machines may claim to be lowest in
upkeep, but experienced shed-owners have only to
examine the distinctive “Lister” features once to
realise how far the “Lister” has eliminated upkeep
expense in the shearing shed. In fact this point is
now so universally recognised that hundreds of
machines of other makes are sent in every year to
be fitted with “Lister” patents where possible.
The improvement illustrated on the left makes “Lister”
Handpieces practically 100% efficient, so that no time is
lost during shearing owing to shear repairs. What is more, the
certainty of perfectly level tension being maintained saves the
shearer a lot of worry, and makes for more efficient shearing,
with a consequent gain to the shed-owner. And this is only one
of many points of “Lister” superiority. The whole thing is
set out in detail in our latest booklet, Bulletin 145 A. It is
worth your while reading, and we should like to send you a copy
while the supply lasts. Ask for it.

HOT WATER
on a Commercial Basis
For Horn’s —Hotels, Hospitals and Clubs.
Hot water costs a lot of money, generated the old way in small quantities,
to say nothing of the time expended and the vexation incurred when guests
are kept waiting, particularly during the early morning rush on the bath-
rooms. Then it becomes time to install the British-American and European
system of
“IDEAL”
HOT-WATER SOPHY
which gives a continuous stream of hot water at the
taps, in the bathrooms, kitchen, laundry or wherever
required, day or night, singly or simultaneously. “Ideal”
Boilers burn coke, require charging with fuel about four
times in 24 hours, and supply up to 2000 gallons per hour.
The “Ideal” Boiler furnishes 50 gallons of really hot water
from about Olbs. of coke. By banking the fire at night
you economise fuel, and ensure an ample supply for the
early-morning rush.
“Ideal” Boilers fit in snugly with any existing kitchen
scheme. Their saving of fuel and smooth working soon
pay for an installation. We will give you an approximate
cost if you write or call. No obligation incurred by
inquiry. “Ideal” Hot-Water booklet free for your
address.
Room warming by “Ideal” Radia-
tors connected with “Ideal” Boilers
is another domestic comfort pro-
vided by the “Ideal” System. An
average-sized room can be heated
in this manner for 24 hours for
about one penny. Write for “Ideal”

New Season’s Styles
in Men’s Overcoats
at LOWE’S.
This is one of the two most important occa-
sions of the year when not only the well-
dressed, but practically attired man decides
on the main features of his wardrobe. Over-
coats are, of course, one of the first con-
siderations. In these, though the old and
popular favorites of dead and gone 1922 are
again to the fore, there is considerable clio ce
as regards color, style and material.

Illustration No. 1 shows a smart style with inset
sleeves, of an extremely smart-patterned Tweed ; the
lapels are a little higher and wider than those of
last year; either plain or strap cuffs may be had,
while choice is about evenly divided as regards flap
and patch pockets. Prices for this coat range from
55/-, 63/-, 75/- to £6/6/-
Gabardine, plain and full-belted styles, not illus-
trated, with fly fronts, run from 38/6. 55/-

No. 2.
Almost equally popular is the double-breasted plain
Tweed Overcoat, with inset sleeves and inverted
pleats at back. In this style dark grey seems to be
the predominating shade, while a dark heather also
compels admiration. Illustration No. 2 shows a
full-skirt model with rather wide and deep lapels, six
buttons, breast and two flap pockets; some feature
plain cuffs, others prefer the turn-back variety.
Prices are 84/-, £5/5/-, £6/15/- to £7/7/-
No. 3.
Double-breasted, full-belted Raglans, in both heavy
and light Tweeds, are coming into greater promi-
nence, especially with younger men. In these, too,
brown and grey shades have no serious rivals, while
the materials most favored are Donegal and English
Tweeds. Prices are uniformly keen, and range from
84/-, £5/15/-, £6/6/- to £7/7/-
The overcheck English Tweed shown in illustration
No. 3 is, perhaps, the most exclusive coat of the
season. It certainly leaves nothing to be desired
as regards smartness. Prices range from £5/15/-
to £9/9/-
Those described above are what may be termed the
“most popular.” There are, of course, numerous
others, but, whatever they are, if worth while, Lowe’s
have them. All the leading English Manufacturers,
as well as Lowe’s “own-made” Overcoats, are repre-

KEEP YOUR BODY IN TUNE.
Your health and strength depend upon exercise.
Exercise is the judicious movement of the organs ot
the body, so that they will not become flabby ; it can-
not carry out its functions in a natural way. It goes
from bad to worse. Eventually, it is a source of
never-ending annoyance—then chronic ill-health.
Judicious exercise is the key of Health. It cuts out
monotony, accomplishes permanent results quickly,
takes up very little time —every movement goes right
to the spot.
THE BAKER POSTAL COURSE OF

quite worked out for the moment.... G.U.S.: Come
down off your verbal stilts ; nobody ever talked like
that and had an audience. .. - Bert S. (Hobart) : How
old are you ? And will you swear it’s original?....
T.8.W.: Makes no points that haven’t been made
already.... Maknade: Interesting if it’s true; but
how was it done?.. . .P.N.: The ailment was fully
discussed by the Abo. Council some time ag0....
B.B.: Hardly worth it... .J.L.: Impossible to handle
such closely-typed stuff Nomad: A yarn very like
that has already seen print... .Mallee: A man like
that deserves one verse, anyway:—
For 60 years as regular as Fate
He went to bed at half-past eight;
His days were filled with honest work,
For there was no kind of toil that the old man would
shirk. .
..... Cox: Only a thin echo of Fitzgerald.... D.M.IC.:
Not quite well enough done... .Hassan (Armidale) :
Choose another pen-name; there is already a Hassan.
None of the verses, up.... Margaret M.; “Brown
Hands” doesn’t even make a pretence of being verse;
“Dream Baby” is too old an idea; “Tranquillity” is
not altogether bad, but you might make it better.
.. ..M.E.D. (Rockhampton): You can't have
“Deirdre” as a pen-name. It belongs to another writer.
The verse falls flat. . . .Chatterton: “Romance” misses,
but not by much. Get rid of the habit of stick-
ing in a word like “so” to eke out a line....
1C.J.8.: Watch your rhymes. You can’t use “firm”
with “turn” without maddening somebody..,.
Wazir: Pleasant enough, but r.ot for us. . . .1.M.M.:
The fierce thing misses. .. .The Trifl'er: A lightweight.
.. ..A.P.W.: He was a very tame sort of knight to
stand that cheap abuse in such bad verse M.0’8.:
A nice idea; see if you can’t make the verse stronger.
Kat: The indictment is tremendous, but we dare
not put the hero's name at the top :
He worked in a dark and dismal shop
To get the wherewithal to buy the meanest chop.
That was before he knew the value of h's “blow',”
Before the principle and man from him did go.
Then he showed the wharfies, who were out in the
cold,
The art of fleecing their boss. His gold
Showed them that to get forty-eight hours a week
They must give a blithering lot of cheek.
But when he humped Matilda through the shearing
shed
Fear from the downcast shearers fled,
And flew' to the squatter. When he awoke
He found himself bleeding and going broke.
He always flew his kite with a string of poisonous
skite,
And using for its tail a scorpion bite.
The opportune wind (that he often wished would
never fail)
Dropped for a little while. So ends my tale.
...F.S.F.: You “wander on without a band” through
the back-of-beyond. Now that is very careless of
you ; you ought to take a church organ at least....
R.L.J.: It could be a little worse.... Eve R.: The
verse needed to be daintier... .C.L.C.: We note that
they wear, tall silk hats at dinner in the mansions
of Potts Point.... Marjorie L.: Not up... .Bertram
I.: Good enough verse, but the subject is without
interest. . . .W.B. (Lovell’s Flat) : Dick is no good.

Your desire to sleep out in the wind and rain should
lie easily gratified in Wellington.... Rio: Re the
Whaddon Chase row, see any current London paper
and bring your knowledge on the subject up to date.

office alligator is much worse than his bark....
Plodder: “The Call” is good, but too slight....
E. (Melbourne): “Food of Love” not for u 5....
ILF.S.S.: Old ideas wrapped in too much common-
place. .. .E.T.A.: Feeble. .. .F.J.C.: Doesn’t make a
yarn. .. . W.M.F.: The sermon misses. ...Sirod: Bad
verse on hard-worked themes... .H.E.T.: Horrible
verse that not even a bribe of seven-and-six in cash
would induce us to print.... Ceme: Not well enough
done. . . .Elfrida: Very crude. . . .R.A.S.: The forest
leaping in tongues of fire because you sang is a

reasonable.... T. Jimm: Don’t care for it that way.

enough in camel sketch. .. .R.F.L.S.: Absurd yarn of
the doings of three idiots... .Yanga: Not good
enough. . . .Z.V.W.: “St. Kilda” doesn’t thrill us. .. .
Knighty: A yarn about the smell of a corpse wifh no
point except the smell. .. .N.J.S.: Very rough....
M.R.S,: You must get a better idea of metre... .
H.W.D.: What’s that —“lips of scarlet shoon” ? You
are sure you don’t mean neck of ivory blucher?....
F. : The worst description of dawn we have
read for a week. .. . A.8.M.: The sort of thing that’s
wailed in a suburban drawing-room. . .8.8. (Argyle) :
Pointless description of misery.... Bellcrive: The
tragic fatalism of the worm moves us strangely:—
Said a snail unto a twisting worm,
“Just mind what you’re about;
Burrow deep beneath the soil,
The greedy fowls are out.
I give you warning as a friend,
They claim you for their dinner;
Burrow under yonder stone,
You’re not a venomous sinner.”
“I thank thee for thy warning, friend,”
The poor worm did reply :
“But I’m fated, sadly fated,
By tragedy to die.”
....Tom P.: Doesn’t make a yarn .. . . H.C.D.S.:
Most of it is quite unintelligible. .. .M.M. (Glenelg) :
None of them get to anything. . . .E.H.8.: “Friend”
found none here.... Askarri: We’d like to help you;
but you’re too general, ... Alastair: Good, but off

wires is interesting... .M.H.: You should get some-
body to show you how to do it... .N.A.M.: You
can't handle pen-and-ink yet....C.K.: An amazing
perpetration.... L.L.: Better stick to the farm.
A.S.: Both off the target. .. ..T.H.: Gags weak or
old, and drawings awful.... Fairplay: You are quite
right. Thank you.

TONY OCTOPUS: HIS BUSY DAY.
fFou Tiie Bulletin.]
“At the Central Police Court a dozen foreign food
purveyors were fined under the Pure Food Act. In
one case the Inspector found two bowls of brawn in
a cooling chamber. There were ‘whiskers’ on the
brawn, and it was mouldy. Defendant said he could
‘trim’ the brawn and sell it.’’
Tony Octopus had started on his sixteen-hour day
When his oysters (marked “fresh daily”) simply
yawned,
For many weeks had vanished since they sipped the
salt-sea spray
On the far-off rocky shore where they were spawned.
So Tony gets his oyster knife and scoops them from
the shell—
When they’re ripe, no other course you can
pursue—
And although they tickle even Tony’s hardened sense
of smell,
They are quite all right when seasoned in the
stew.
Then he polishes the cruet and rejuvenates the sauce
(Made from recipes of noblemen long dead),
And, when fly-tracks have been banished from their
exercising course,
He damps and freshens up some ancient bread.
He gathers ziffs the prawn experts have left upon
their plates
Or strewn around, the floor in drunken sport;
Stacked lightly in the measure (Tony’s hand is like
his weights)
They will make a pint of prawns look like a quart.
Next he puts a little lip-salv.e on anaemic-looking flsli,
Just a touch of varnish brightens up the “cray” ;
And a mass of wilted salad he has shot into a dish
Whilst he hoses off the dust of yesterday.
But tlie crowning renovation that appeals to Tony’s
art,
Though to do it puls his dirty soul in pawn,
Is to hide the fateful warning when old Nature does
her part
By growing mouldy whiskers on the brawn.
Oh, the brawn! the brawn! that talks from dusk
till dawn,»
The meat that from the old cow’s head is sawn,
It’s a fair old dinnyhaiser when our Tony strops his
razor,
And removes the weeping whiskers from the brawn.

' I’at Bushie” ; It is now almost 12 months
since the £lB p.a. drop in the basic wage
affected the salaries oi : N.S.W. public ser-
vants and law clerks, hut still nothing has
been done to reduce solicitors’ and court
fees, to which 20 per cent, was added when
the cost of living spared.

“Hus”: Now under the wrecker’s ham-
mer, the old Adam and Eve Hotel, in Little
Collins-street, which figured prominently in
the _ Gun Alley horror. At one time the
ancient hostelry was the meeting-place of
the Bohemians of the city, and V ictor Daley
and Henry Lawson have sheltered under its
roof. It fell from grace a few years ago,
was delicensed, and has since been used as
a cheap dosshouse.

"Girofla”: “X2X’s” suggestion, that per-
fumes could be profitably extracted from
many indigenous plants, looks better on
paper than it works out. Among the lime-
stone ridges in North Queensland grows a
dwarf shrub, every part of which exhales a
beautiful, mercaptan-like odor. A friend
and 1, alter a series of experiments and cal-
culations, concluded that, with up-to-date
machinery, we could not put the extract on
the_ market at less than the impossible price
of ss. an ounce. The extraction of the alco-
hol is a tedious process, requiring an expen-
sive apparatus. Some excellent scents are
extracted commercially from many species of
eucalyptus, but not with any sort of cheap
plant. Boronia has the fault that it gives
very little perfume. Waratah is not nearly
plentiful enough to be considered commer-
cially. The wattle flower is good as far as
its perfume goes, but there is not enough
body in it.

“Country Bed”: Our women writers are
always mourning over the hard working con-
ditions of women on the land. But it is no
use blaming politicians; the person most
responsible generally answers to the name
of Dad. He buys the most up-to-date im-
plements for his farming operations, but
doesn’t give a thought to the need of the
missus and the girls for labor-saving devices
in the kitchen, around the house and in the
dairy. If only he had them dinned into his
head as often as he ha s the advantages of
modern farming implements, it might make
him more considerate. Our agricultural
societies might do some of the necessary edu-
cational work by featuring effective modern
kitchens, dairies, pantries, bathrooms, wash-
houses, etc. A well-illustrated pamphlet
dealing with costs would add to the produc-
tiveness of the scheme. lam satisfied that
more good would emanate from such a scheme
than is derived from the exhibition of cats
and londogs, not to mention circus stunts
with high-jumping horses.

“PLS.S.” on droughts and bush-fires: —
Some large stockowners try to view a drought as
Nature’s cure for a few of the ills that beset the
grazier, and regard it therefore as something of a
blessing in disguise. They argue that it sweetens
the country and gives it a needed rest, and that the
losses incidental to the sweetening and resting pro-
cess are more than compensated for by the advantages
and profits that accrue in the good seasons that
follow. Pastoralists generally agree with that state-
ment in so far as it relates to soil-sweetening influences
and the extermination of certain stock diseases; but
most of them have reason to know that the remedy
is worse than the disease. The drought of 1900-01
killed so many sheep that it took 10 years to breed
up to the old numbers again; and many a squatter
was too utterly down and out to make another
start. In coastal districts the bush fire is a period-
ical sweetener. It runs amok at times, but no
grazier would willingly exchange it for the other
calamity. It mightn’t be as deadly to certain organ-
isms as an old-man drought, but it leaves a more
wholesome atmosphere, for part of the drought’s
legacy consists of putrefying carcases, blowflies in
billions, and stagnant water that becomes so foul
as to cause typhoid, diphtheria, and other un-
pleasantnesses.

COMPRESSION
Compression good? Of course:
that’s the sort of thing you take for
granted. As soon as you have cause
to doubt your compression you’re
likely to get an uncomfortable feel-
ing' about the whole engine.
Doubtful compression will knock half
the joy out of driving any car.
But there’s no real excuse for it.
When your cylinder walls become
“gummed up,’’ when carbon gets in
the way, there’s generally just one
cause—faulty lubrication.
Texaco Motor Oil maintains perfect
compression because it has the neces-
sary stamina to resist the tremen-
dous temperature: and it does keep
your cylinder free from hard carbon.
Texaco Motor Oil lubricates your
cylinder wall with a smooth film
that holds the compression as the
piston rings slide up and down.
Your engine power depends on that
compression.
Use Texaco Motor Oil and get the
power you are entitled to: take your
compression for granted.

YouTl admit that the four-cylinder, four-

reliable and most satisfactory engine for hard
Marine use.
Ybull admit that. 15h.p. is the right, size for
most fast runabouts, family launches, cruisers
and .work boats up to 32ft., and for twin-screw
installations in larger beats.
After edreful study and experiment we de-
cided to make the wearing parts of our latest
mobel the 15-h.p. “B-4” Engine inter-
changeable with “Ford” Parts.
Two major considerations influenced this
decision; first, they are of strong, rugged con-
struction, made of the best raw materials
obtainable; and, second, replacements can be
secured promptly and at small cost, in practi-
cally any part of Australia.

filling. His score, at present, is 32. His.
first wife bore him 21 olive branches in 23
years; his second wife has presented him
with 11—the youngest a few months old. In-
cluded in the grand total is one pair of twins.
“Topee”: “Caveman” (B. 22/3/’23) is
far out at sea on the “graveyard-watch”
question. He confounds “graveyard” with
“gravy-eye.” The former term is peculiar
to the South Pacific; the latter was the
time-honored designation for the morning
(4 to 8 a.m.) watch long before the
early ’seventies, when I sailed in the China
tea and eke the Cape Horn trades.
Died recently in London, almost a nona-
genarian, Annie Sophia, daughter of Robert
Campbell, of The Wharf, Treasurer in the
first anfi second Cowper Ministries. In
1857 she married Colonel Edward Wolsten-
holme Ward, of the Royal Engineers, first
Master of the Sydney Mint (1853-61)) and
of the Melbourne Mint (1869-76). Major-
General Ward, as he had become in 1877,
died in 1890. In Sydney he was better
known as cricketer than soldier.
“C. Coral”: A recent correspondent work-
ing out The Bulletin’s delivery days in
various centres of the Commonwealth specu-
lates as to when the red cover reaches Thurs-
day Island. That depends on boats, ship-
ping strikes and so forth. ‘But even after
it gets to T.I. the “Bully” has to do an-
other 100 miles or so in a fishing lugger
before it gets to its furthest-north subscriber
in Australian waters —one of the lone white
dwellers on an island in Torres Strait.
“Jacky Roo” (Lond.) : In the hour of his
fall Hughes got better notices from the Lon-
don papers than at any time since 1916. The
one notable exception was the Star. That
journal moodily remarked :
W. M. Hughes, the last sham and charlatan of the
war, has been exposed and exploded. His exit has
little dignity. “These be thy gods, O Israel,” might
well be the reproach directed to a people who fell
down before such a golden calf as this.
I wonder what William did to the Star.
“The Deacon”: How’s this for the “Hard
Luck” Stakes? A mate and I were hanging
on to the only available possie—the platform
of our homing train —when a red-hot cinder
blew into Bill’s eye. In agony he whipped
his ’kerchief from his hip pocket and away
flew four single £1 notes. Although it
seemed to me as hopeless as looking for
Casabianca after the ship’s explosion, Bill
strained far out in a last endeavor to locate
his lost wealth, and —collected a red-hot
cinder in his other eye!
Those who are behind the importation of
the Dreadnought boys should discourage
General Rosenthal’s practice of meeting the
lads on arrival in Sydney, and signing them
up as members of his King and Empire
Alliance. The Alliance has been definitely
condemned by members of the R. S. League
as a political and sectarian institution. The
object of Australia should be to imbue these
youngsters with neither Imperialism nor
Ilibernianism, neither Mannixism nor Rosen-
thalism, but with loyalty to the Common-
wealth. If Rosenthal is allowed to meet
each ship with the nominal roll of the King
and Empire Alliance in his hand, there is
no reason in logic or equity why A.L.P.
representatives shouldn’t do likewise.
“Rotom” on medical inspection in schools:
My experience in the country schools of N. S.
Wales makes me less sanguine than “Country Ped”
(B. 22/3/’23) respecting the benefits to be derived
from departmental medical inspection. Doctors may
diagnose, but it rests with the parents whether the
recommendations are carried out, and I can affirm
that usually they are not. The smallest provisional
schools in N. S. Wales have had periodical medical
and dental examinations during the past 10 years.
To the parents of children found physically imper-
fect official notices are sent, suggesting suitable treat-
ment. It is the exception to find them acted upon ;
by many they are simply ignored, from others the
teacher receives an insulting .note intimating that
parents are quite capable of managing their family
affairs without his interference.
“Pedro”: N.S.W. Education Department
deserves sympathy in the hubbub now raging
about its inability to supply schoolbooks
free; for this promise was made by some
politically jacked-up Minister bitten in sev-
eral places by the "free education” bug, and
the Department should not be barked at be-
cause it can’t do the financially impossible.
But what it ought to be caned for is the
unconscionable number of books which it
compels parents to buy and pupils to study.
For the intermediate exam, this year It
expects the youth delivered into its hands
to know and “pass” Dickens’s “Great Ex-
pectations,” “Twelfth Night,” “Robinson
Crusoe,” “Selections from the Australian
Poets” and some of Tennyson’s poems. In
Latin, Cresar’s “Seventh Campaign in Gaul”
and some of Ovid. In French, probably two
small books. All this “English” and “lan-
. guages” for youngsters of from 13 to 16, who
also have to swat up mathematics and his-
tory and physics and other alleged mind-
food. Ail in quick time, too. At the school
attended by Pedro, jun., not all the “Eng-
lish” books are available, and what are on
tap have only arrived durum the last week or
two. It is impossible for any child who isn’t
a cormorant to get all this down in the
eight months now available, and what the
smartest may manage to swallow will give
them mental indigestion. The Education
Department needs to consolidate. At pre-
sent it flings so many subjects and books
at the unfortunate pupil that he emerges
from his annual surfeit stuffed with an in-
choate hash of promiscuous learning, and,
except in rare cases, with no solid grip on
any sort of school-fed knowledge.

“My motto is Rexona."
—Miss Dorothy Brunton.
Why Not Enjoy
a Good
Complexion?
You cannot enjoy a Rood complexion it
you do not care for the delicate skin of the
face. When you wash your face do you
realise that it is not enough to simply re-
move the dirt, but that your skin needs a
soothing, healing influence to keep your com-
plexion fresh and free from blemish t Scented
toilet soaps are often very pleasant, but do
not assert this influence, as you are well

joy and pain.
We’ve been over all the world, there

Piping down the windy ways,
Dancing, singing through the days,
We, the ragged rhymers, gypsies out of Spain.
Feathers red within our caps, shod with

Jingling silver in our hands stolen from

Gold have we a-plenty—see
Splashes of the sun! Ah, we—
We are rich in wonder, ask of us a boon!
Ask of P'ain for laughter, pay her w T ith a kiss,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\\T OT I says,” remarked Private
| V William Mainguy, of the Mar-
ines, “is that a cove can’t stand
it. That’s wot I says, an’ that’s wot I
maintains. Stiffen me, they calls us leather-
necks, but to my way o’ thinlcin’ leather-
guts ’d be nearer th’ mark, judgin’ by wot
they gives us to put into ’em. I arsk ye, is
two pound o’ pork, an’ two and a ’arf o’
flour, a pint o’ rice, an’ a pint o’ pease
enough for a growed-up man for a week?
Wot if they does give us ten pound o’ fish
when they catches it? Wot abart it? ’Ow
often does they catch it? ’Oo gets it w’en
it is caught? I ain’t never ’ad it. An’ th’
pork stinks. An’ th’ flour’s weevily, an’
the rice’s mouldy, an’ th’ pease is like slugs
ye put in a musket. An’ there ain’t no
flamin’ beef at all. Yus, I arsks ye, ’oo’s
a-goin’ for to stand it? Not Bill Mainguy!”
The group of seven soldiers of Sydney’s
earliest garrison, seated round a little fire
before one of the thatched huts in the
Marine lines above the Cove, looked with
some apprehension upon the burly figure of
the speaker, who stood with hi's back to
the moonlit waters of the harbor, staring
down at the white faces of his audience.
Behind them still stood many trees of the
forest that had clothed all the country when
they had first landed in Port Jackson, some
15 months before, and the sides of the long
valley tapering to the southward reared
themselves against the stars in a dark and
lonely fashion. There was a subdued hum
of trivial noises from the huts of the little
settlement —still hardly better than an en-
campment—on either side of the Tank
Stream, and somewhere in the women’s lines
an indifferent musician played “The British
Grenadiers” upon a tin-whistle.
“How ain’t ye a-goin’ for to stand it, Bill?”
presently asked a ruddy-cheeked youth at
the end of the horseshoe of squatting men.
“How are you a-goin’ for to not stand it?
What can ye do? What can any of us do?
All hands share these reduced rations —even
th’ Commodore hisself. What can you do
about it?”
“That iss right, William, my fine fellow,”
chimed in another from the centre of the
group. “ ’Tis fery right, indeed, what .Timmy
says. How the tefil are you a-goin’ to
change it? Haf you a shipload of profisions
of your own out o’ London River? Got
pless my soul, William, I think you talk a
little big—I do, indeed !”
Mainguy leaned forward and shook a fore-
finger at the last speaker.
“’Tis no big talk, Taffy Jones. You
coveys listen to me, an’ I’ll tell ye ’ow ’tis
to be done, quick enough. An’ safe enough,
too. There’s a-plenty waitin’ for them as
is game to take it. Lookye, boys, we’re all
in th’ one hut here, an’ all friends. Will
ye promise not to talk outside us seven if
I tell ye of th’ plan I’ve made? ’Twill not
do to have more in it—’twouldn’t be safe.
The seven of us is plenty. We ean live like
gentlemen, if th’ rest of you coves’ll bear a ’and
in carryin’ out my lay. AYot say ye, now?”
Another man voiced the feeling of the
meeting by remarking simply: “Bill Main-
guy, if you can show us how to fill our guts
we’re with ye to a man.”
A chorus of grunts expressed approval of
this sentiment.
“Then listen to me,” said the Cockney in
a half-whisper. “You mark wot I says.
I’ve pot a lecy to th’ stores.”
A low whistle came from one of the group,
and, open-mouthed, the six marines stared
up at Private Mainguy.
“Yus,” he went on in a low tone. “I was
sentry over th’ big store Toosday se’nnight
when th’ Commissary come down to do some
work be candle-light. ’E lef’ th’ key in
th’ padlock, an’ w’ile Vs inside I ups an’
takes a himpression of it on a bit o’ soap
I ’ad in me pocket. Nex’ day I takes a
drorin’ o’ th’ key to Barney Wilkins, th’
blacksmith, an’ arsks ’im could ’e make one
like it, a-tellin’ ’im ’twas th’ key o’ me chest
wot I’d lorst. ’E made me a lock, too, wot
I arsked ’im for to do, to fit th’ key. an’
two keys. I give ’im a guinea for tli’ job.
I put th’ lock on me chest, an’ threw the
old one away. So now I’ve got two keys
that’ll let me into th’ store any time I likes.
Well, now. wot d’ye think o’ that?”
Again there was a silence for a full half-
minute. Then another man rose to his feet,
took a stick from the fire and lit his pipe
and stood up beside the blaze, close beside
Rill Mainguy.
“Bill.” he said, “ ’tis robbin’ th’ stores,
y’r thankin’ of?”
“Aye—better to rob ’em than to starve.”
“ ’Tis death if y’r caught!”
“ ’Tis death if y ain't got enough o’ food
to keep ye alive.” Mainguy turned from
him with an impatient gesture, and addressed
himself again to the half-circle of his won-
dering comrades. "We needn’t be caught.
Wat’s easier, I arsk ye, than for a couple
of us, when any one o’ th’ rest ’appens for
to be sentry over th’-store-’ouse, to slip in
there wi’ one o’ these ’ere keys, an ’elp
theirselves to wot’s there to be took away?
I’ve a-thought it all bout, I tell ye, an’ ’tis
as safe an’ heasy as smokin’ a pipe o’ ’baccy.
’Tis th’ heasiest thing in th’ world. But
we must be all in it—all or none.” He
turned to the man beside him. “Ain’t ye
game, Tom Pearce, to save y’self from a-dyin’
o’ starvation?”
“Oh, I’m game,” replied the other slowly.
“I’m game enough—-on’y I’m thinkin’ ’tes no
use bein’ blind to it that each one of us goof!
about wi’ a rope round his neck from the
first time we does it. Ye ought to think o’
that, lads.”
“What says you, Taffy?” asked Mainguy.
The Welshman puffed at his pipe for a
moment or two. Then he took it from his
mouth and waved it in the air. “Yess, Billy.
I’ll go in with ye.”
“And you, Johnny Waters?”
“Aye, I’m one,’’grunted the man on the right.
The Cockney asked each in turn by name
whether he would share in the desperate en-
terprise, and each, with more or less hesi-
tation. grunted or whispered his assent.
Ten months after the incorporation of the
co-operative company outlined above, Major
Itoss, the officer commanding the-Marine de-
tachment, called one evening upon his Excel-
lency the Governor, lie found him in con-
sultation with that much harassed official
of the civil department, Mr. Andrew Miller,
the Commissary-General.
Captain Phillip had been installed for some
time in his new quarters on the eastern side
of Sydney Cove —a six-roomed brick cottage,
which stood on the south-west corner of the
present intersection of Phillip and Bridge
streets—which were, with many additions,
to do duty as Government House until 1845,
when the present building in the Inner
Domain was first occupied.
Upon his inquiry whether the Governor
was disengaged, the orderly on duty informed
Major Ross of Mr. Miller’s presence. Where-
upon the Commandant, with the pomposity
for which he was noted, requested the man
to take his name in at once.
Phillip rose to his feet as his second-in-
command entered the room. His lined face
was pale and worried, and he had an air
of anxiety and care that made him look older
than he really was. The arrival of Major
Ross —who was not the least of his anxieties
—was not an event that might be expected
to clear his brow or suffuse his countenance
with cheerfulness. Mr. Miller also rose and
made his bow to the Major.
“Good evening. Major,” said the Gover-
nor. “You wish to see me? Pray be seated.
Mr. Miller and I were discussing the state
of the stores. I understand your business is
of importance, so our endeavors to make
bricks without straw, or to feed hungry
people on next to nothing, can wait a little
while. And to what business, may I ask, Major,
am I indebted for the honor of this visit?”
There was a note of quiet sarcasm in Phil-
lip’s voice which was not lost upon the
Lieutenant-Governor. Seldom a week passed
when the much-Worried viceroy did not re-
ceive a more or less wordy communication
in writing from the Major, setting forth some
grievance, real or imaginary, which had to
do with the status of the Commandant of the
garrison, with the grumblings of its officers
or the discontents of its rank and file.
“I have called, your Excellency,” said the
Major stiffly, “I have called with reference
to the six men of my corps who were to-day
condemned to death by the Criminal Court
for robbing the stores, and who are to be
executed in the morning. I have one or two
representations with regard to the case "-hat
I would like to put before your Excellency.”
Phillip frowned slightly, and a deeper
shadow came into his weary face.
“Yes, yes, Major. I do not wish particularly
to reopen a discussion concerning the fate
of these misguided men ; but. pray, what is
it you have to say about them ? Prey, express
your views. I shall be glad to hear them.”
Major Ross cleared his throat a little ner-
vously and hesitated, as though even he
could feel that the request he was about
to make was hardly a fair one to the Governor.
“I am hoping that your Excellency may,
even at the eleventh hour, be inclined to
extend your clemency to these unfortunate
men—if not out of considerations of mercy
to them as individuals, at least out of some
consideration for the honor of the corps to
which they belong. It must appear to you,
sir—as it "does to me—that this is a dread-
ful thing to happen to the Royal Regiment
of Marines.”
Phillip nodded wearily. “It does, my dear
Major, it does, indeed,” he said.
“May I beg, therefore, your Excellency,
that you will be pleased to grant them a re-
prieve, and deal with their offence in some
other fashion? I assure you that such clem-
ency will not be misconstrued by the de-
tachment. If, perhaps, one man were to
suffer death, and the remainder to undergo
such punishment and degradation as might
be deemed proper in the circumstances, I
feel sure that the ends of justice would be
adequately met.”
Phillip rose to his feet, and began to pace
up and down the room with his hands be-
hind him. The Commissary leaned back
in his chair, and watched his two superiors.
Major Ross sat bolt upright, and stared at
the Governor aggressively. Presently the
latter halted, rested his hand on the back of
a chair, and addressed the Major.
“Lookye. sir.” he said, slowly. “You
know the desperate situation in which we
stand —the whole of this settlement?”
The Major nodded stiffly.
“We have in the Stores —I have just been
computing it with Mr. Miller —scarce enough
provisions to sustain life in this community,
even at the reduced ration which is now on
issue, for another six months. Our situa-
tion is perilous in the extreme. It is of the
greatest importance that every ounce of
food be weighed and measured out, to high
and low alike, with the utmost impartiality.
You and I and all the officers have had to
go upon short commons in the same way as
has the meanest of the convicts. We do not

They have doubled their pay
for a farthing a day.
This headline means
exactly what it says.
The man and the girl
in the picture are real
people. You may see them
any day working side by
side in a city office—the
man as manager of a de-
partment, the girl as his
typist.
Always you’ll find them
fresh, alert and cheerful.
No chance of improving
their work —and their
prospects —escapes them.
As a result, they have
each doubled their pay —
for a farthing a day —the
cost of the Kruschen habit
which has made them fit
and efficient.
They were not always
bright and cheery at their
work. They used to have
“off-color” days days
when they felt as if their
bodies were all nerves.
But one day he read
something about Kruschen
Salts and he discussed it
with her, and it sounded
so sincere and convincing
that they both decided
to start the Kruschen
habit. It’s very simple, as
they found. You just take
every morning as much
Kruschen Salts as will lie
on a sixpence in your
breakfast cup of tea.
That’s all —but the result
is amazing.
After a fortnight you
feel a new being, because
liver and kidneys are func-
tioning properly and your
whole system is being
toned up. Impurities are
cleared from the blood.
In their place comes a
glorious, exhilarating feel-
ing of physical health and
mental vigor, of buoyant
cheerfulness and self-con-
fidence.
Your whole outlook is
changed, brightened. You
are fit and well—and you
know it.
Prove this to your pro-
fit. It may double your
pay—for a farthing a day.
Why? Because a bright,
alert worker is worth two
sleepy ones at any time.
z>
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will
lie on a sixpence. It’s
the little daily dosa
that does it.
Good Health for a Farthing a Day
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
just the right amount for a most in-
vigorating daily tonic. The medici-
nal dose for persons suffering from
pains of rheumatism and gout, or
habitual constipation, with inactive
liver, etc., is half to one teaspoonful
in a tumbler of hot water before
breakfast.
Every chemist sells Kruschen
Salts in 2/9 bottles (2/6 in New
Zealand) ; one bottle contains 96
morning “pinches”—enough to last
three months. Get a bottle to-day.
NOTE.—Kruschen Salts are made in Manchester, Eng-
land, by E. Griffiths Hughes, Ltd., established 1754,
in the reign of George the Second.

know when relief may reach us. It is so
long overdue that one is led to wonder
whether we may have not been entirely for-
gotten in England.”
"Yes, sir—yes. But that is not the ques-
tion.”
“You must excuse me, Major, but it is
very much the question, unfortunately. A
question which we cannot beg. And what
have we found at the trial of these soldiers?
Why, that for many months —for close upon
a year—the very men upon whom we have
depended to guard and conserve our slender
resources have been systematically plunder-
ing them. Selfishly, callously, treacherously.
There could have been no more deliberate
scheme invented than that which this man
Mainguy has been proved—on his own con-
fession—to be the author of. I regret that
we have had to accept this fellow as King’s
evidence. His guilt is ten times more than
that of the men he has led astray. It is a
rank injustice that his life, should be spared,
whilst his dupes suffer, but it is an injustice
which I cannot help, lie has had his pro-
mise of mercy, and it must be fulfilled. But
were I to accede to your desire, it would be
an end of all government in the Territory.
The thing is impossible. These wretched
men must suffer. The very existence of this
community depends upon the force of such
an example in deterring others from doing
likewise.”
“But the disgrace to the Regiment, your
Excellency!”
Phillip held up his hand. “It is true that
the Marines have been disgraced by these
seven men, but they would be still further
disgraced were an exception made in,their
favor because they are Marines. I gave it
very clearly to be understood that the death
penalty would uncompromisingly be inflicted
upon any one detected in such a crime as
they have been guilty of. There is no help
for it—they must suffer. Their crime is
worse than if they had been common con-
victs. Infinitely worse. No, my dear Major,
I regret that I cannot entertain your request
for one moment. I am sorry that you; have
thought fit to make it. My duty is a pain-
ful one—but it is clear.”
Major Ross stood up, frowning and dis-
pleased. “Would to God I had never been
ordered upon this service, sir!”
Momentarily Phillip lost the divine gift
of an 'all-enduring patience that was his.
“Would to God you hadn’t, sir!” he ex-
claimed.
Scowling blackly, the Major bowed, and put
on his hat. “Good evening, your Excellency.”
“Good evening, Major Ross,” responded the
Governor sternly.
“Your Excellency is right, if I may be per-
mitted,” observed the Commissary, when
Major Ross had left the. room.
“Yes, yes, Mr. Miller,” said the Governor
wearily. “Quite right, I know. But ’tis a
trying life, sir—a trying life. A man needs
to be made of iron to discharge his duties
faithfully in this place.”
« * *
At 8 o’clock on the following morning
the three companies of Marines were under
arms and paraded in the open space that had
been cleared of scrub and timber to serve them
as a drill-ground. A little before 9 they
marched, to the tapping of the drums, down
to the head of the Cove, about the position
of the present Macquarie-place. Here a
great gum-tree stood with six noosed ropes
dangling from its lower branches; The troops
were formed into a hollow square about three
sides of the place of execution. Outside
them, talking noisily and excitedly, crowded
the little population of the colony. A party
of convicts grouped themselves about the
executioner beneath the shady branches of
the big. tree. They were his assistants, who
would 'haul upon the ropes that were to
swing the unfortunate men into eternity.
Acrdss the rude bridge of logs that
spanned the Tank Stream there presently
came marching, with the Provost-Marshal at
their head, a little party of soldiers with
bayonets fixed, and in their midst, arms
bound behind them, walked the six pale men
who were appointed to die. The chattering
convicts immediately became silent. But
when William Mainguy, escorted, by two sol-
diers, appeared in the rear of the melancholy
procession there was a momentary murmur
that sounded like execration. Behind them
all walked the Rev. Richard Johnson, the
chaplain of the colony.
“Halt!” commanded the Provost-Marshal,
when his party reached, the tree. Then, to
the executioner: “Fix them up—put the
ropes about their necks.”
In a deathly silence, the hangman and his
men went amongst the victims, and escorted
each to one of the dangling nooses. Behind
each man, large pegs had been driven into the
ground, to which the other end of the ropes
would be tied wdien tlie unfortunate men
were lifted from the ground. Two convicts
held the slack ends of the ropes in their
hands, ready to haul them up when the sig-
nal should be given.
The Provost-Marshal, Mr. Brewer, then
stepped into the middle of the parade and
read his warrant for the execution of .the six
men. When he had finished this grim for-
mality, he turned towards the Governor, and
waited a sign from him for the completion of
his morning’s work. Sadly and dejectedly
the Governor stepped forward and spoke.
“I regret extremely,” he said, “the neces-
sity of having had to call all the inhabitants
of the colony together in this way to witness
the punishment of these men. Gladly would
I have pardoned them but for one thing. It
must be impressed upon each and every
man, woman and child in the settlement that
the most serious crime it is possible to com-
mit here at the present juncture is the one of
which these six soldiers have been found
guilty by the court, and for which they are
now about to suffer death. Under no cir-
cumstances hereafter will clemency be shown
to any, person who is detected in robbing the
Stores. I give fair warning to you all. and
trust that the example which you now see
before, you may act as a deterrent. That is
all. Mr. Brewer. You may proceed.”
Suddenly from the Provost-Marshal’s
guard a loud yell split the awful silence that
lay over the valley.
“Cap’n Phillip—y’r Ex’lenzy! F’r th’
love o’ Gawd—a moment. Jest one moment!”
It was the voice, hoarse and excited, of the
informer, Mainguy—the man who had be-
trayed his six fellows to their doom. The
Governor turned, and held up his hand to
stay the executioners. There was a buzz of
excitement from the crowd behind the parade.
“Yes, what is it?” called the Governor.
“I takes it all back, y’r honor. ’Twas me
alone that done it. Th’ blame is all mihe.
F'r th’ love o’ Gawd spare these men. Let
me swing instead of them-,”
Phillip shook his head-4ml waved a signal
to the Provost-Marshal. At the very last
moment a cry came from one of the men
about to die:
“Bill Mainguy, ye we’ve but one
Hell to face. You’ve this world an’ the
next!” '

The Cripple.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MM HERE had been a slight accident in the
g shunting yard during the morning.
Two or three trucks had jumped the
points, but tne wneels were quickly drawn
back on to the rails and the marks on the
road covered before any interfering examiner
had time to notice the misadventure. This
saved official reporting and subsequent ex-
plaining, and the shunters went merrily on
with their train marshalling. The delay
caused by the accident was not sufficient to
make itself felt, and the rake of No. 91 was
backed into the shed for loading one minute
before time.
No. 91 was the bogey of the shed loading-
staff. Spasmodically she had started late
throughout the year, but this week she had
disgraced her loaders by being behind five
consecutive evenings. Hot messages came
sizzling along . the wires from the top
office, and blame was passed from one to the
other until even the old deaf barrow-mender
was drawn into the embroilment.
Matters would have cooled down and con-
tinued much in tne same way, early or late,
had it not been the eve of the holidays. That
set the whole staff out to rush the business,
so as to sign off as early as possible.
It had been a stinging day. The inside of
the long shed was piled high with cases,
packages, casks, bags, bales, furniture and
machinery, all jumbled together like so much
wreckage. We sorted out and loaded with a
swing, and there was hardly an idle moment
all day. Trains were completed and sent
out to the transit yard in record time. At
7.25 p.m. there was a slight lull for a
breath. Then No. 91 was backed in, groan-
ing on her wheels like a huge reptile in
. distress.
Now. the real battle against time com-
menced. The rake was due out at 9.15 p.m.
Amid the clatter of work and the chatter
of voices the goods on the shed floor began
to fade out of sight. Exactly at the stroke
of 9 o’clock the doors of the last big covered
van were slid open, and a double-header put
on—two gangs loading the same truck at
the same time, with two stowers in the truck.
Three Star, the long, angular Irishman,
was in charge of one end, while Old Peter,
with whiskers down to his chest, stowed the
goods at the other end. Barrowmen were
now to burn, and a constant stream rattled
past the tallymen as the pickers-out piled the
goods on. Brands were shouted out, and the
work swayfed with a shed-made chantey ;! —
Tommy Brown was a stower bold —
Use no hooks! Use no hooks!
Tommy Brown had never been told
Use no hooks! Use no hooks!
They sent him in a piano grand,
He used his hook instead of his hand —-
Now he’s leading the unemploy’d band!
Tommy Brown! Tommy Brown!
. Three Star was drenched with perspira-
tion. He clapped big, wire-fingered hands
on to the goods as they were shot in at him.
“Come inside,” he would shout, although he
could not have coped with an acceleration
of speed. “Don’t stand outside—ye’ll ketch
cold. Come inside, fer Hiven’s sake.”
A constant raillery was directed at Old
Peter, like machine-gun fire. “Keep it up,
Peter, keep it up.” The old stower’s eyes
lit up with fury, and his wet, bald head was
visible for a moment under the rays of the
hurricane lamp. “Be !” he boomed,
fiercely. He made a savage swipe at a
cheeky barrowman, but his whiskers got
caught in the hoop-iron of a case.
“Be —!”
“Don’t say that wur-r-rd,” admonished
Three Star. “Shure ye’ll be here till mid-
night if ye swear.”
Up and down, in and out, the head porter
walked,' clasping his hands first in front, then
behind. In spirit he lifted with; the men,
pushed the barrows, stowed the goods. Even
he sweated with the imagination of toil.
At last the big van was on the finishing
strokes, and the shunter’s engine was honk-
ing outside. The head porter went in to
Three Star. “We’re on the heels of it,” he
said. Then he turned to Old Peter. “Only
a hatful left, Peter. We’re on time.”
“Be —- —!” shouted Peter.
“Mahn, ye’re silly,” said Three Star; “luk
outside, ye can see the last uv of the goods
wid the naked eye.”
The last article went in; the head porter
smiled. “Boys, you’ve done well. Record
tonnage, too.”
“Not enough to fill me eye,” said Three
Star, extravagant] v.
The van was labelled and sealed. Barrows
were left standing or flung to one side. Bag
aprons were removed and hands washed
under the taps along the wall. Then coats
were got into and the crowd filed towards
the window of the time-office.
The head porter was taking a last look
around when his eye caught the feeble ray of
a hand-lamp the other side of the line of
trucks. Fascinated, he watched the lamp
move slowly along the rake, the under por-
tions of the vehicles showing up in relief.
The light stopped at the big van just com-
pleted. A body clambered noisily over the
couplings. The head and shoulders of a
rat-faced man appeared above the edge of
the platform.
The newcomer grinned and chuckled devil-
ishly. He fumbled in his pocket and pro-
duced a. card. This he slipped in over the
destination label on the truck, and, to make
sure it stayed, drove a tack through it with
a hammer he carried. Even as a rat dis-
appears, so he disappeared.
With a start the head porter awoke to a
sense of duty. He rushed towards the time-
office, where the men were putting in their
dockets.
“Boys, boys,” he shouted. “Wait —wait!
You 11 all have to come back! The blasted
examiner’s red-carded the van a cripple.
We’ll have to tranship her!”
THE RUMPUS.
