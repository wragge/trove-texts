LINDISFARNE PRIORY, CRADLE OF CHRISTIANITY IN NORTH ENGLAND
T INDISFARNE PRIORY was the cradle of English Christianity
in the north of England during the sixth century. The Priory
was founded in a.d. 635 by St. Aiden, a missionary from lona who
was invited by King Oswald to establish Christianity in his king-
dom. St. Cuthbert was made bishop of Lindisfarne in 684 and
was buried on the island. In the monastery which was established
here Ceolwolph, King of Northumberland (a.d. 729), having abdi-
cated his throne, became a monk, and it is recorded that it was he
who obtained permission for his monastery to be allowed to drink
wine and ale.
When the pagan Vikings descended on Holy Island in a.d. 875
and destroyed the monastery, the monks fled, taking with them the
body of St. Cuthbert, and the successive removals of the saint’s
body from place to place before reaching Durham is men-
tioned by Sir Walter Scott, who also describes Lindisfarne in
“Marmion.”
The existing ruins, as shown above, date from 1083, when a
Benedictine monastery was founded on Lindisfarne Island as a cell
to Durham Priory. The ruins, mostly of red sandstone, afford an
admirable example of Norman work with a strong resemblance to
the mother-house at Durham.
Recent excavations on Holy Island have revealed a number of
stone crosses dating from the Anglican period (a.d. 675-875), which
are now preserved in a small museum on the site of the original
monastery. The most important relic is, however, the Lindisfarne
Gospels, the superb illuminated manuscript of the early years of
the eighth century, which is one of the chief treasures of the British
Museum in London.

THE GO EBBELS DIARIES.
The Goebbels Diaries, translated and
edited by Louis P, Lochner (Hamish
Hamilton), is a selection from a mass of
typed manuscript, singed and smelling of
smoke, found in the courtyard of his
Ministry in Berlin. Mr. Lochner attributes
the smoke to the amiable Russian habit
of burning the German archives and send-
ing the empty filing-cabinets to Russia,
but it would be pleasing to believe, rather,
that Goebbels left a whiff of brimstone
behind him.
To give the devil his due, he did leave a
fascinating book. As a work of literature
it is not in the class of Ciano’s Diary —an
opinion which would have distressed
Goebbels, for he thought little of Ciano
as a writer and much of himself—but as
an exposure of the Axis from within, if
not as a human document, it is almost
equally absorbing.
As a self-portrait it lacks candor. Even
in the privacy of his own mind, or in such
privacy as a dictated diary afforded,
Goebbels had a habit of addressing him-
self as if he were a public meeting. He
blames the Jews for causing the war ; he
blames the Poles, the French, the English
and once, under Goering’s influence,
Ribbentrop; but not once does he admit
that Goebbels may have had anything to
do with it. One regrets that the diary
ends in December, 1943, for by that time
the disasters on the Russian front and in
the Middle East and, especially, the
R.A.F. raids on Berlin —
The sky above Berlin is bloody, deep
red and awe-inspiringly beautiful. I just
can’t stand looking at it. It seems as
though all the elements of fate and nature
have conspired against us to create diffi-
culties. If only frost would set in, so
that our tanks might moVe again in the
East! —
are beginning to make the war real to
him.
For the most part of the diary he lives
in his own unreal world of propaganda.
“I have received confidential informa-
tion concerning the probable successor
to the Archbishop of Canterbury,” he
wrote on January 25, 1942. “He will be
Bishop Temple, who is much more
dangerous than the old Canterbury
gentleman. That means we may expect
a number of severe attacks from the
English clergy. But for the moment I
see no special danger in this fact.” The
war was something on paper, a long way
off; menacing and .terrible sermons
might be preached in churches across
the Channel, but Goebbels would ward
them off, Goebbels would do his job for
Hitler, Goebbels would save Germany:
he would write a deadly article.
People, it is true, were getting killed
somewhere or other in the war, but they
were so far off they hardly existed any-
how. They were statistics. The problem
was to decide when would be the best
“psychological moment,” for propa-
ganda purposes, to release the casualty
lists.
There is something strangely unreal
in the whole of Goebbels’s outlook. He
dealt in abstractions. There was an
abstraction called the Jews. He pro-
posed to wipe this abstraction right out
of Europe, The Jews were wicked capi-
talists ; the Jews were wicked Com-
munists : both these, simultaneously,
without any thought of a contradiction.
The Jews (except when it happened to
be the Poles, the English, the French or
Ribbentrop) had caused the war. The
Jews were “the first to introduce the lie
into politics as a weapon”; Hitler had
told him so:
Aboriginal man, the Fiihrer believes, did
not know how to lie. The higher the
human being developed intellectually, the
more .he acquired the ability to hide his
innermost thoughts and give expression to
what he did not really feel. The Jew,
as a primarily intellectual creature, was
the first to learn this art. He can there-
fore be regarded not only as the carrier
but as the inventor of the fie among human
beings.
And, as a matter of fact, not only were
the Jews capitalists. Communists, the in-
stigators of the war and the inventors of
the lie, but they were also English; or
at any rate the English were Jews, which
came to the same thing:
Eden delivered a flood of sobstuff
bemoaning the fate of the Polish Jews.
•All members of Parliament rose from their
seats as a silent tribute to Jewiy. That
was quite appropriate for the British House
of Commons, which really is a sort of
Jewish exchange. The English are, any-
way, the Jews among the Aryans. The
perfumed British Foreign Minister, Eden,
cuts a good figure among these characters
from the synagogue. His whole education
and his entire bearing can be characterised
as thoroughly Jewish.
Obviously, therefore, the Jews would
have to be abolished; “that is only right.”
They would be abolished in gas-
chambers. “Beginning with Lublin, the
Jews under the General Government are
now being evacuated eastward. Not
much will remain of the Jews. About
60 per cent, of them will have to be
liquidated; only about 40 per cent, can
be used for forced labor.”
True, the “procedure” would be
“pretty barbaric” ; true, there would be
“a multitude of personal tragedies” when
it came to separating husbands from
wives and parents from children when a
Jew had married a non-Jew ; but then,
“you just cannot talk humanitarianism
when dealing with Jews.” And the
“pretty barbaric procedure” was hap-
pening a long way off: in gas-chambers,
in Poland. Everything, except the
statistics, was unreal; and as far as the
statistics were concerned, Goebbels could
only rejoice that “fortunately a whole
series of possibilities presents itself to us
in war-time which would be denied us in
peace,”
Monstrous though Goebbels is in such
passages, it is the unreality of his utter-
ances rather than their ferocity which
strikes the reader most forcibly. Basi-
cally, one doubts whether he hated the
Jews at all. Any exercise of power and
any act of murder was gratifying to him,
but he found his real satisfaction in this
respect in objects nearer at hand. The
Jews were merely a convenient scape-
goat, a symbol of his own bad con-
science. It was Goebbels who (.with
Hitler) was the liar ; Goebbels who (with
the rest of the Nazis) had started the
war; and, deep down, where the truth
lay hidden, it was Goebbels whom
Goebbels hated. One wonders whether,
when his six children were poisoned and
he and his wife went out into the garden
of Hitler’s chancellery to be shot by his
S.S. orderly, Goebbels faced himself as
well as death at the end; or whether he
died as he had lived, deceiving himself.
Certainly he himself had to die one way
or another, and perhaps his wife, too, if
she was to escape trial and imprison-
ment ; but the horrible slaughter of the
children seems to have been quite un-
necessary—a last gesture of propaganda,
a final unreality.
When he allows his real personality to
escape from the smokescreen of the
propagandist, Goebbels reveals himself
chiefly as a petty tyrant. He is always
calling in some miserable subordinate
for “a good dressing-down.” He likes
to throw a few ministers of religion into
a concentration camp for criticising the
regime; he likes to see “exemplary
punishment” imposed on an artist for
being unwilling to exhibit his pictures
for fear they should be destroyed in air
raids; be has notions about imprisoning
all the teachers of dramatic schools; he
is continually exasperated with the judges
for not punishing people who have com-
mitted no legal offence; he orders that
no judicial decisions are to be published
in the newspapers without the permission
of his department; he wants secret re-
ports on the officers of the Army ; he in-
trigues against his colleagues and notes,
for the day of reckoning, the names of
the “pigs” and the “camels” he most
dislikes.
Sometimes, as when he feels com-
pelled to offer prizes to encourage polite-
ness among the people, or when he
orders an investigation into the “nuisance
of questionnaires” —“This has really
become a public scandal. One can hardly
buy an orange today without answering
one of these absurd questionnaires”—
he arouses a certain sympathy; even the
Nazis had to put up with National
Socialism, But the typical Goebbels is
the Goebbels who agrees with Himmler
that conscientious objectors to military
service must be put to death or who,
when Mussolini is in refuge in Germany
after his fall, simply cannot understand
the Duce’s reluctance to murder those
who had deposed him:
If the Duce were a man whose politics
were uninfluenced by family considerations
he would have Ciano executed instead of
forgiving him, and would have his daughter
whipped The Fiihrer expected that the
first thing the Duce would do would be
to wreak full vengeance on his betrayers.
He gave no such indication, however,
which showed his real limitations. He is
not a revolutionary like the Fiihrer or
Stalin. He is so bound to his own Italian
people that he lacks the broad qualities of
a worldwide revolutionary and insurrec-
tionist.
Fear drove Goebbels, of course; that,
and the love of power. The fear, always
hastily smothered in propaganda, shows
clearly throughout the diary, in the inces-
sant reassurances to himself that the de-
bacle of 1918 could not happen again,
in the continual complaints that not only
the common people but the highest
officials were listening to British broad-
casts, in the talk about defeatism and in-
flation, in the suspicion of the generals,
concerning whom Hitler’s opinion was
“devastating”:
All generals lie, he says. All generals
are disloyal. All generals are opposed to
National Socialism. All generals are re-
actionaries. While that is not true, he is
nevertheless right in some respects. He
just can’t stand them.
It is a curious picture that Goebbels
gives of Hitler. Mr. Lochner, quoting
from an earlier, unpublished diary, be-
lieves that Goebbels genuinely wor-
shipped his leader —“And those large
blue eyes! Like stars! He is glad to
see me. I am supremely happy.” In the
present volume there is something of the
same enthusiasm, but there are also
moments of doubt and, more than any-
thing, a kind of protective pity. It is a
quaint, lonely Hitler who, unhappy at his
headquarters among the disloyal generals,
plays tenderly with his little dog Blondi
—“The Fiihrer had great fun with his
dog Blondi, who has become his faithful
companion. It is surprising how much
this animal has adjusted herself to him.
It is a good thing that the Fiihrer has
at least one living thing constantly with
him.” It is a peculiar, mystical Hitler,
who has fought the whole Russian Army,
all through the winter, with his will-
power. It is a mad Hitler, talking abso-
lute lunacy about the Jews. It is a sad,
pitiful Hitler who, after the winter of
1942, “never wants to see the snow again
in his life,” and who needs “air, sun-
shine, spring; the whole atmosphere at
G.H.Q. is most depressing. Always sur-
rounded by snow, ice and frost no man
can live there happily, not even a super-
man.” It is a Hitler so much in need
of love that Goebbels “decided then and
there that my family and I must look
after him more after the war.” It is a
sort of ghost of Hitler.
One does not quite know what to make
of Goebbels’s adoration of Hitler. Other
people’s gods, like other people’s babies,
are always difficult to appreciate. But if
loyalty, wherever it appears, is a virtue
and if human affection, on whatever it
may be lavished, makes a man human,
then Goebbels, where Hitler was con-
cerned, had virtue and humanity. Per-
haps, as Louis Lochner suggests, his
suicide, 24 hours after Hitler’s, was an
act of loyalty as well as a recognition of
necessity.
But it is impossible to see Goebbels,
except in rare moments, as a great or dig-
nified personality. Even in thef* conclud-
ing pages of the diary when, itching with
a nervous rash and sick with headache,
he picks his way among the ruins of the
Nazi palaces, praying for one night’s
respite from the R.A.F.’s bombardment,
the dignity he acquires by his sympathy
for the victims and his efforts to relieve
them is marred- by his cheap opportunism
and his vanity. “Show these people a
few small favors and you can twist them
round your fingers,” he says after one
demonstration of popular affection.
“There were deeply touching scenes,” he
says after a visit to the industrial suburb
of Wedding: “One woman had given
birth to a child during an air raid two
or three days ago ; nevertheless she in-
sisted on getting up when she heard I had
come, dressed and hurried to the Platz.”
Goebbels was “touched” by what flattered
his vanity.
He had a hand in great events;
recorded that the Vichy French would
have “tears in their eyes” if they knew
what Hitler really intended for them;
said that Quisling (his phrase that
Quisling was “nothing but a Quisling”
may be credited to him as a genuine
witticism amongst his customary crude
vituperation) was “very childish” in bis
hope of eventually establishing a free
Norway; he had plans for seizing Venice
as well as South Tyrol from Italy after
Mussolini’s downfall; he hoped that
Sweden and Switzerland would “burn
their fingers before this war is over,” re-
gretted that the Nazis had not taken
Sweden during the campaign in the
north, and said that “this State has no
right to national existence anyway” ; he
regretted, because he feared the “Yellow
Peril,” that the Dutch, “the most obsti-
nate and obstreperous people in Europe,”
had lost Java, but concluded that “in the
last analysis so small a people has no
right to any overseas possessions while a
nation of Germany’s rank has none” ; he
bore with equanimity the news that the
Japanese proposed to occupy strategic
points in Australia before proceeding to
Ceylon to paralyse British shipping in the
Indian Ocean; he agreed with Hitler
that “the rubbish of small nations” in
Europe must be cleaned up after the war.
But a man is not necessarily great be-
cause he takes part in events of this mag-
nitude. Goebbels’s plans for world-
domination seem no more than an exten-
sion of that petty tyranny he practised at
home, with the difference that here, as in
his attacks on the Jews, there was some-
thing abstract and unreal about his
malevolence.
Louis Lochner sees him as “a coldly
calculating realist,” but that is applicable
only to his little bullyings at home and
his personal intrigues for power. What is
there realistic about a statesman who,
with a mere blast of invective, thinks he
has wiped out the most powerful factor
in contemporary world politics—Ameri-
can arms production? What is realistic
about a statesman who shows, time and
again, that he secretly admires the British
above all other peoples—both as “a civi-
lised opponent” and as a “pigheaded
nation” whose ability to take hard blows
“compels admiration” —and who, most of
the time, affects to despise them as “bark-
ing dogs” and “the Jews among the
Aryans”? What is there “cold and cal-
culating” about a man who, on the news
of British victories, “cannot endure
falling into a black rage every day and
fairly tearing myself to bits with anger”?
And what, in the final count, is realistic
in Goebbels’s! pretence that “some day,
somehow” he will carve up the world to
his liking when, on the second page of
his diary, talking about defeatism in Ber-
lin, it is obvious that he knows in his
heart that Germany will be beaten?
Ciano had at least the wit to see what
kind of men were plunging Europe into
destruction: “tragic clowns,” he called
them. Goebbels, though he hated most
of his colleagues, was too vain and too
lacking in imagination to comprehend the
tragedy he was helping to bring upon the
world. “Dressing-down” his subordinates,
adoring the boss, tyrannising ordinary
citizens who had no redress against him,
raging against the mitigating influences
of law and religion, treating artists with
brutal contempt, winning battles with an
article and carving up the world in a
dream, he seems like some clerk out of
a government department jumped up to
rule a nation. In a period of stable and
aristocratic government his talent for
vituperation and his willingness to do
murder would hardly have raised him
higher than the gallows. In a period of
revolutions he saw his chance, took it,
and, with the press and the radio at his
command and the Gestapo at his back,
held it; and, obviously from his diary,
while his reign lasted, enjoyed it. There
is no fun like the fun of pushing people
around.
Reviewed Briefly.
There Was a Time: Taylor Caldwell
(Collins). Long, romantic novel dealing
with the struggles of a writer. It begins
in Leeds, with some comedy and much
rain in the slums, then shifts to America,
where it ranges from the New York
business world to the oilfields of Ken-
tucky. Overwritten, but colorful.
A ttainment: Alan Gross (Bread and
Cheese Club, Melbourne). This booklet,
printed for private distribution, is sub-
titled “a critical study of the literature
of Federation.” It contains a useful
bibliography of works directly related to
Federation, there are some kind words
for The Bulletin and a good apprecia-
tion of Deakin and The Federal Story,
but, since it widens into a general survey
of Australian literature, it can hardly be
more —in nine pages—than an introduc-
tion to the subject, a preliminary study
suggesting a method of approach.
A Basic Course in Technical Drawing:
Alan Sierp (Angus and Robertson). The
author is senior master at Adelaide High
School, and the book, recommended by
the S.A. Superintendent of Technical
Schools, is “designed for secondary
schools meeting the public examination
requirements.”
A Direct Entry to Organic Chemistry :
John Read, F.R.S. (Methuen). One of
a series of “Home Study” books edited
by B. Ifor Evans. It is intended for the
layman as well as the student.
Willow’s Point: C. Drummond Man-
son (Museum Press). Sheep-stealing
and other adventures for children with a
setting on a New Zealand station. The
author knows a totara when he sees one.
Hull-Down for Action: Armstrong
Sperry (Bodley Head). Adventure for
boys set on Guadalcanal. The book is
nicely made, and the reptiles encountered
in the jungle include Japanese.
Alsos: Samuel A. Goudsmit (Sigma
Books). The author led an American
mission to Germany after the war to dis-
cover how far the Germans had pro-
gressed with atomic research. He found
. that their scientists had not gone beyond
“halfhearted preliminary experiments
into the possibilities of a nuclear chain
reaction,” and has made a readable book
out of his inquiries. The professor s con-
cluding plea for the international ex-
change of atomic secrets, on the grounds
that America might develop Germany s
complacence, is ingenious but singular y
unconvincing. Professor Goudsmit does
not specify the nation or nations to o
taught how to make atom bombs; out
if the Soviet is to be told, as is usually
the plea, would the Professor, to be com-
pletely fair, place this dangerous y
also in the hands of the Japanese? Ana
what about the Hottentots?

Text of the letter written by Mr.
Balfour to Lord Rothschild in 1917
commonly known as the Balfour
Declaration ?
Dear Lord Rothschild, — I have
much pleasure in conveying to you
on behalf of His Majesty’s Govern-
ment the following declaration of
sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspira-
tions, which has been submitted to
and approved by the Cabinet: “His
Majesty’s Government view with
favor the establishment in Palestine
of a national home for the Jewish
people, and will use their best en-
deavors to facilitate the achievement
of this object, it being clearly under-
stood that nothing shall be done
which may prejudice the civil and
religious rights of existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine or the rights
and political status enjoyed by Jews
in any other country. I should be
grateful if you would bring this
Declaration to the knowledge of the
Zionist Federation.”

What is vegetable ivory?
Vegetable ivory is obtained from
the tagua-palm, which grows wild
along the west coast of South
America. It is a palm-fern, 10ft.
to 20ft. high, with a short trunk
crowned with laBge, bright-green
feathery leaves. The fruit is some-
what similar to the coconut, grow-
ing in drupes about the size of a
man’s head. A woody fibrous wall ,
encloses the seeds proper, which are
hard, white and fine-grained, like real
ivory.

How is celluloid joined?
A mixture composed of three parts
alcohol and four parts of ether is
used. Being very volatile it should
be kept in a well-corked bottle. The
surfaces to be joined are painted over
with the mixture until they soften.
The surfaces are then pressed together
and left for at least 24 hours.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.S. Views Berlin.
All manner of American com-
ment has never ceased remind-
ing Britain and France of
Munich. In Berlin, the U.S.
has had an equivalent on its
own hands, for responsibilities
long since assumed have made
the final decision on Berlin an
American prerogative.
Also, it is quite certain that
this time Britain is not going to
be caught holding the fort alone,
at the staggering cost which has
J. Bull on crutches still.
The major American responsi-
bility for final decision against
the Russian aggression a
Munich, or a stand at the risk of
war —has been accepted in most
U.S. quarters. On the Munich
course —further appeasement of
Russia by a Western withdrawal
from Berlin —N. Y. “Times”
has commented that “such a
course might postpone a show-
down, but could not possibly
avert it.
“For a Western surrender of
Berlin would be such a blow to
the democratic forces and give
such an impetus to further Com-
munist expansion that the loss
of Berlin would inevitably lead
to the loss of Germany. And
the loss of Germany would in
the end mean the loss of Western
Europe, which would confront
Britain and the United States
with at least as grave a menace
as was ever posed by Hitler.
“That is not only freely pro-
claimed by the Communists but
is also fully realised by most
leaders of the West, except pos-
sibly in divided France. And
that realisation is also behind
the solemn Western statements
that we are in Berlin to stay and
cannot be forced out by any-
thing short of war.”
Similarly accepting that this
time Uncle Sam is called oh to
be in it from the beginning,
“Christian Science Monitor”
has viewed Berlin as meaning
the Russians, for the first time,
contesting a major area held
by American troops “a
direct challenge to the American
military position at a point
which holds a direct key to
prestige and responsibility on the
European Continent.”
The “Monitor” has seen the
Russians as hoping that the sig-
nificance of their pressure
on Berlin would not be under-
stood in the United States. “For
if they can obtain evacuation by
American troops it would be a
withering blow at Europe’s con-
fidence. The overweening ques-
tion is whether America will
keep its commitments —whether
it really intends to hold the dike
until the Marshall Plan begins
to rebuild economic and politi-
cal sanity.
“Withdrawal would snuff the
last candle of light east of the
Iron Curtain. And it would set
ablaze new fires of Communism
to the West.”
The “Monitor” holds that
probably the Kremlin would
never have dared its action in
Berlin had it not counted on the
confusions of an electoral year
in the United States. “What
Russia needs to understand is
that the noise and fury [of the
Presidential shindy] are only
overtones. It needs know
that the purposeful foreign
policy which is committed to the
support of freedom in Europe
will not be sidetracked by
political parades.”
N. Y. “Times,” however, has
contrasted the unity being shown
in Britain with the lack of it in
the U.S., and has suggested that
the British example might well
be followed by Mr. Dewey and
President Truman “to dispel any
Russian notion that the Ameri-
can Presidential election can
immobilise the United States.
For whatever may befall us,
there is now a fateful urgency
in the maxim that united we
stand and divided we fall.”
On this aspect also, N. Y.
“Herald Tribune” has com-
mented that Washington has
“remained wrapped in Presi-
dential politics.” This, it has
stated, “is having a shattering
effect on every friend we [U.S.]
possess in Europe ; it is repeat-
ing a picture of inertia and divi-
sion quite comparable to that
which led to Munich and cap-
able of quite as serious conse-
quences.”
The Russians, the “Herald
Tribune” comment added, “are
not playing simply for the Wes-
tern sectors of Berlin. They are
playing for all Germany and the
Ruhr, trying to force the West
to readmit them to a ‘joint’ con-
trol of all Germany on terms
which would soon convert Ger-
many into another Soviet satel-
lite. This has been their aim
from the beginning; this is a
last and desperate effort to
achieve it. The best answer is
to prove to them once and for
all how desperate it is and how
colossal will be the damage to
the Soviet Union from any
attempt to pursue it further by
these barbaric and disgraceful
means. That is the best answer ;
but the West cannot make it if
all the West gets from Washing-
ton is timidity.”
Ample Provocation.
Berlin has at least provided
the strongest evidence of the
Western Powers’ desire for peace
and reluctance to fight.
Part of the long list of
Russian provocation there, as
checked by N. Y. “World-Tele-
gram,” is that Russia has vetoed
every German peace move;
walked out of tjje Big Four Ber-
lin Council, where common
policy was supposed to be de-
cided ; imposed rules which
made life in the German capital
uncomfortable ; arrested Allied
personnel without cause and
held them incommunicado for
days; established roadblocks
along the corridors, forcing day-
long detours for a journey pre-
viously made in an hour; sub-
jected freight-trains, passenger-
trains, automobiles, trucks and
personnel to humiliating search ;
and finally blockaded the two
and a half million Germans in
the American, British and
French sectors of Berlin with a
view to starving them into sur-
render.
It isn’t so long since half that
calculated provocation would
have set a war going.
Dewey on Corns.
Probable next U.S. President,
Governor Dewey left no doubt
about his attitude to the fifth-
column fraternity in three short
answers to questions:
1. Do you agree that the
Communist organisations in the
world today are under the direc-
tion of the Kremlin in Moscow?
Certainly.
2. Do you agree that the
world Communist organisation
is a threat to world peace? Cer-
tainly.
3. Do you agree that the ob-
jectives of these Communist
organisations is to destroy the
liberties of other men? Cer-
tainly.
Dewey added, however, that
he would not favor outlawing
them.
Uncle Sam’s Navy.
During the next 12 months the
U.S. will operate the very power-
ful Navy of 277 major combat
ships, supported by others, total-
ling 486 (including landing
craft); a grand total of 763 in
service.
A report by N. Y. “Times”
military writer Hanson W. Bald-
win states that the bulk of the
ships will be manned to 65-75
per cent, of war-time comple-
ment ; the fleet operating in the
Atlantic slightly larger than that
for the Pacific, Both fleets will
be especially formidable in
carriers.
In addition to maintaining
and operating these ships, the
U.S. Navy is maintaining 1970
vessels of all types in the inactive
or “mothball” fleet; 664 of
these are major combatant
vessels,
■ As well, funds provided re-
cently by Congress are going
into a huge building programme,
the big list of new ships includ-
ing one mammoth. This is the
65,000-ton carrier to cost
$124,468,000, completion date
not yet known, but expected to
require 46 months’ building
time. This ship will carry 24
50-ton four-engined bombers —
possibly jet-bombers capable
of operating in radii of about
1700 miles. The ship’s engines
are expected to develop 280,000
horsepower, which will give it a
speed of 33 knots, and it will be
heavily armed with new-type
guns.
The designs of the mammoth,
says Baldwin, indicate it will be
the largest ship ever built. It is
to be 1030 ft. long at the water-
line, 1090 ft. overall. Beam will
be 130 ft. at the waterline ; 190 ft.
normal maximum, which can be
increased to 236 ft. by hinged
extensions.
Concessions to Arabs.
Jew-against-Jew in Israel is a
serious development, for the
moment obscured by the return
to war; and it isn’t confined to
Israel.
Zionists and the Council of
Judaism are having a dingdong
tongue-war in America, where,
also, the League for a Free
Palestine carries on a propa-
ganda-war against the Israeli
Provisional Government, charg-
ing:
“(1) The Provisional Govern-
ment would not oppose the an-
nexation of the Negeb by Ab-
dullah,
“(2) The Government would
surrender Jaffa to Abdullah and,
in addition, pay ‘a considerable
indemnity’ for Arab losses in the
battle of Jaffa.
“(3) The Government would
create a free zone in the port of
Haifa for the use of Abdullah.”
Also the statement of charges
adds that even greater demands
were being made by the Arab
king, and “are being con-
sidered.”
Jewish Nationality.
London “Times” was here
quoted (B. 7/7/’4B) as contend-
ing in regard to the Jewish State
of Israel that “the privileges of
secular statehood must carry
with them the accompanying
sacrifice of any claim upon the
allegiance of Jewish citizens of
other countries; no claim for
double nationality can be ac-
cepted.”
An identical view is) taken by
the American Council of Juda-
ism (non-Zionist, but representa-
tive of a considerable strength
of Jewish Americans). This
organisation, citing contentions
of the Provisional Government
of Israel that it represents “the
self-evident right of the Jewish
people to be a nation,” stated
that such contentions “impinge
upon the authority of every
nation of the world over its citi-
zens of Jewish faith.”
It added: “We therefore em-
phatically declare that the State
of Israel is not the State or
homeland of ‘the Jewish people.’
To Americans of Jewish faith
it is a foreign State. Our single
and exclusive national identity is
to the United States. Our ex-
clusive spokesman in all inter-
national affairs is) the Govern-
ment of the United States
through its authorised repre-
sentatives. American citizens
have no right to participate in
the political life of'the State of
Israel except through the proper
agencies and procedures of the
Government of the United
States,”
It is also “essential,” the
group said, that Israel’s national-
ism be confined to its own
borders, and added that the new
State cannot represent those of
Jewish faith who are citizens of
other nations, and “cannot be-
stow rights upon them or exact
obligations from them.”
The statement concluded :
“We hope that both the Zionist
movement and the Provisional
Government will recognise the
necessity of making clear the
complete severance of Jews who
are citizens of other nations
from this new State.”
Dissidents in Russia.
A Russian publication in
Belgium called “Chasovoy”
(the “Leader”) has published an
article based on the informa-
tion of recent escapees fpom
Russia suggesting that fears of
a revolt to get rid of the Kremlin
dictatorship is a strong factor
against a Soviet-launched war.
On the main dissident ele-
ments, one of the exiles writes:
“There are, first, the technical
professionals who work to ex-
haustion for the realisation of
plans foreign to their accustomed
Russian ways. Then there are
officers of the Soviet Army whose
military distinctions have failed
to bring expected results and
who are pushed aside by new re-
placements —only now, since
the last war, have they fully
understood the real meaning of
dictatorship. And finally there
are veterans —soldiers whose
heroism and self-sacrifice dur-
ing the last war are forgotten.
Back from war, they have to
work like madmen for a pur-
pose they don’t understand.
They are hungry and in many
cases without a roof over their
heads that they could call
‘home.’ ”
Fear of internal trouble from
such dissidents is elsewhere re-
garded as one of the main brakes
on Soviet policies leading to
war. The Tito bust-up is re-
garded as indicating that, while
Communists would be Soviet
fifth-columns wherever the breed
flourishes, Russia would have
plenty fifth-columns on its own
hands if it set a war going.
Free Health.
A London correspondent of
“Wall-street Journal” describes
Britain’s “ambitious new ‘free’
health service” as having (on
July 5) “got off to a running
start —with the gait of a rather
lame duck.”
The service “will be ‘free’ in
the sense that the taxpayer will
shell out most of the cost—some
£120,000,000 in the first 12
months and much more later.
The theory is that henceforward
the Government will foot the
bills for anything from a bad
tooth to a broken leg or a new
baby; the Britisher in pain
won’t have to plunk down a
penny.
“In practice such a medical
Utopia is a long way off. In
the first place, there won’t be
enough doctors. The majority
of them have been feuding
bitterly with Aneurin Bevan,
Minister of Health. No one
knows how many can be lured
into the programme. The battle
is over terms of employment —
many doctors refuse to become
mere paid civil servants. They
want it down in black-and-white
that their professional freedom
will be protected from Whitehall
bureaucrats.
“The men with drills and
forceps feel much the same way.
Furthermore, there won’t be
nearly enough nurses, midwives,
hospitals, medical and dental
apparatus to swing the scheme.
Some shortages can’t be
remedied for a generation, say
critics of the plan. The Gov-
ernment’s own curbs on build-
ing, for instance, will hold up by
several years the new health
centres supposed to go up in
local communities.”
But, “ready or not, Britain’s
health service begins, along with
a giant and costly social-
security programme, the
national insurance scheme which
is supposed to provide payments
for most everyone in Britain —
from dukes to dustmen —in the
event of birth, death and a host
of other contingencies.”
So henceforth, “whether they
like it or not, and need it or
not, Britons will reach into their
wallets every week” to foot the
bill for their latest British free-
dom, new style.
Dragnet Digest.
The Berlin Danger. —ln the view
of a N. Y. ■ “Times” correspondent
on the spot it has all turned on the
simple fact that where troops of two
antagonistic power groups are in
close contact, as they are in Berlin,
the possibility of the type of “in-
cidents” which lead to war is always
present. “Intemperate words of
statesmen and generals can be dis-
counted by skilful diplomacy. But
not bullets and death.”

Another Gouzenko Revelation. —
The Soviet Embassy cipher clerk in
Ottawa, Igor Gouzenko, who gave
the information exposing the Russian
spy-network in Canada, gives a curi-
ous item of additional information in
his book The Iron Curtain. Gouzenko
relates that one of many amazing
discoveries he made after arriving in
Ottawa was that “everything favor-
able to the Soviet cause and to the
Communist party-line was being sup-
ported by a large number of Canadian
Jews.” It surprised him, he states,
because he knew that in Russia anti-
Semitism has been encouraged by the
Stalinist regime.

Governor Dewey’s speech accepting
the Republican Presidential nomina-
tion:' “Our future —our peace, our
prosperity, the very fate of freedom
—hangs in a precarious balance. Mere
victory in an election is not our task
or our purpose. Our task is to fill
our victory with such meaning that
mankind everywhere, yearning for
freedom, will take heart and move
forward out of this desperate dark-
ness into the light of freedom’s
promise.”

The New Janissaries. —Referring to
the janissaries of the Ottoman Em-
pire, youths recruited from con-
quered populations and trained as
soldier-slaves, who were at once the
backbone of thaf empire and the most
savage warriors of their time, employed
to terrorise the very people from
whom they came, N. Y. “Times” has
reported on the new janissaries. These
are the Greek children who are being
kidnapped by the thousands by Greek
Communist guerrillas and sent to
Russia’s Balkan puppet States,
including Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,
Hungary and even Czechoslovakia, to
be trained as Communist agents and
guerrillas of the future. ,
* * * *
Callous New World. —Referring to
the Soviet kidnapping of
many thousands of Greek children,
N. Y. “Times” has commented; “The
world has seen so much horror dur-
ing the past few decades that it may
have become too callous to take
much note of more. But it would
seem that the time has come for the
United Nations to take at least some
action to wipe this particularly shame-
ful blot from our civilisation.” It
seems just part of the picture that
“United Nations action” has become
merely a funny expression like
“civilisation.”

Hard on Henry. —ln the American
Presidential-election fashion of not
pulling any punches, George E.
Sokolsky, in N. Y. “Sun,” comments
on Henry A. Wallace’s position;
“When Wallace’s name is mentioned,
it is often met with a leer. To most
Americans one meets, Wallace seems
to be queer; they do not seem to
understand what he means. Wallace’s
influence is on the wane everywhere
because he has made himself alien
to the current manner and thought
of his own people. He has pushed
himself into the position of an out-
sider. Even should he get a large
vote in New York and California,
his leadership in the country is gone.
Everybody wants peace, but not a
coward’s peace.”

Britain’s Coal Flop. —For all the
machinery put into it, British coal-
mining shows no improvement.
Washington “Post” states that “the
coal output per man-shift at mine-
face is slightly less at present than
it was in 1938, although the per-
centage of coal mechanically cut has
risen during the past decade from 58
per cent, to 74 per cent, of total
output, with comparable increases in
mechanical conveying. Furthermore,
the percentage of absenteeism is far
above pre-war rates and more ton-
nage was lost through wage disputes
in 1947 than in 1938.” The U.S.
interest is connected with the Marshall
Plan; evidence that aided countries
are not doing all they might to help
themselves isn’t going to encourage
future dollar handouts.
* * * *
U.S. and Spain. —Commenting on
various points of difference in British
and U.S. Mediterranean policies,
N. Y. “Times” chief European
correspondent C. L. Sulzberger makes
one revelation about which more will
no doubt soon be heard. “The United
States,” he reports, “has quietly in-
timated to Spain that it harbors less
antipathy for the Franco Government
than that of the British Cabinet.”

Nice Job for U.N.O. —If U.N.O.
isn’t too busy trying to rectify the
gross blunder of Palestine partition
(called by Dr. Evatt an “achieve-
ment”), it might be interested in
another job suggested by Senpps-
Howard foreign editor William Philip
Simms, touching on Berlin : “Some
Allied diplomatists are convinced the
whole matter of Russia’s making
scraps of paper of all treaties and
understandings should be taken to
the United Nations without delay. It
world peace was ever in danger, it
is pointed out, now is the time, ft
the U.N. ever intends to act as peace-
maker by citing an aggressor, count
by count, the time is now. me
evidence would be damning.

“The Commonwealth civil service, at over 166,000 persons, has almost trebled since 1938. Income taxes levied on behalf of the Commonwealth have multiplied nearly sixteen
times. Departmental costs alone in 1947-48 were six times the figure for 1938-39."

"PHILOSOPHER" ABROAD.
During his five-day-week visit to Lon-
don Mr. Chifley excited the press boys
with a “hectic” passage to Berlin and
back, where those admiring fellows,
moved to superlatives to do him justice,
declared that, whizzing around the city’s
western zones in a mere supercharged
ground-machine, he “saw more in eight
hours than most observers would see in
eight weeks.”
In Berlin Mr. Chifley peeked through
some railings at the Russian zone. He
received from Allied officers on the spot,
and from the evidence of his own senses,
confirmation of hitherto (to him) incred-
ible warnings that this Red revolutionary
“philosophy” really aims at anarchy,
mass misery and, if necessary, another
great war. He conversed with German
trade-unionists, from whom heard that
this was actually what they, too, thought
about the Communist “philosophers.”
Then he returned to London and spoke
over the radio like a man convinced at
last that counter-action is necessary:
We must hold on. The Australian Gov-
ernment fully approves the stand which
the Allies have taken. It is the only one
which can be taken. That is what I shall
tell Australia.
That is not all he is pledged to “tell
Australia,” by which expression—since
all loyal Australians require no telling
—he must be referring to the Moscow
agents bossing the local trade-unions, the
firebrands who take their orders from the
same Moscow gang whose work he
glimpsed in Berlin, Mr. Chifley has
committed himself to this also:
For Australians the going will continue
to be hard The key to the situation lies
in production. Hard work isn’t only a
national duty, but the stern responsibility
of every Australian if we are to survive.
We are standing by Britons now in
the fight for economic stability. It may be
a long fight.
Mr. Chifley himself has done a lot to
make it a long fight by allowing the
potential national effort during these
past three post-war years to be frustrated
and go to waste. If, as he says, he has
given “assurances of support for Britain’s
firm policy with Russia” —if his Govern-
ment is going to play its part in the effort
of the Western democracies concentrated
at the moment in Berlin —then it is time
he made his demand for home produc-
tion (reiterated a dozen times this past
two years) mean something.
Mr. Chifley has returned home to find
the output of coal being sabotaged, as
ever, by the same larrikin lawlessness,
industry in every State idle for one work-
ing day a week, the railways so starved
for coal and manpower that in N.S.W.
they can’t shift wheat to flourmills
or waiting ships, the steelworks so
short of rationed coal that plants are
working at about 60 per cent, of capacity,
the miners demanding a 35-day week, the
A.C.T.U. joining forces with the miners
to declare for nationalisation of the mines
(which Mr. Chifley has already refused)
and a rise of 245. a week in the basic
wage, which would make it £7 a week
and send every State Government bank-
rupt. And the ’A.C.T.U. boss, whose
habit is to mimic the Prime Minister
when he is not mimicking Molotov, had
only just before Mr. Chifley’s departure
overseas “supported” his latest plea—or
the one before last —for more produc-
tion, which, he told “the toilers,” alone
could secure to them a higher basic wage,
“The Government,” said Mr. Chifley
in his London broadcast, “will take ap-
propriate action in the future, however
drastic it might be.” What “drastic” may
mean in his vocabulary nobody can be
sure, but what he ought to do is to:
Cut taxation “drastically” enough to
give directors and employees in industry
alike sufficient incentive to work for those
rewards which alone will boost production;
Cut down the intolerable overburden of
bureaucracy, and the scandalous expen-
diture it involves, of which the joint effect
in cost, irritation, interference in enterprise
and draining of the labor market com-
pletely neutralises any effort to increase
production.
Demand, and call upon State Govern-
ments to demand, that, if the 40-hour week
is to stand, necessary overtime shall be
recognised as mandatory in every Govern-
mental or semi-Governmental enterprise.
Notify union executives in every essential
service and industry that, if it is neces-
sary in order to check wanton strikes called
by those executives, the Government will
proclaim a state of emergency under the
Crimes Act, and take the prescribed action
thereunder, especially where these wanton
strikes are in defiance of the Federal
authority or of tribunals or agencies of
the Federal authority.
Nothing less will serve as a test of the
Prime Minister’s sincerity. He is up
against the same enemy here that he
identified in London and Berlin as oppos-
ing the organisation of peace and eco-
nomic prosperity. He sees the same ser-
vants of Moscow enforcing, at their
whim, the same stoppage of transport,
the same idleness upon railways and
wharves and shipping, the same closing-
down of industry generally, and all for
the same objective of anarchy and revo-
lution. He sees the mass of honest
workers “crucified” by this brutal
devastation of the national economy, but
he has hitherto shut his eyes to that, for
his narrow view has been that only the
capitalist boss “crucifies” workers. If he
does not know better now, and does not
mean to give effect to his latest pledges, he
had far better resign, take to pub-keeping
and admit that the salvation of the nation
from the “economic disaster” he has fore-
shadowed requires some leader with
“guts.”
There is nothing more treacherous to
the country than to pretend that ctirrent
symptoms are evanescent, that industry
will soon “shake down” happily to the
reduced working week, that a bit more
socialisation here and there will call back
the promise of the “Golden Age,” that
strike-drunk unions will sober up if only
the country gives them time and
sympathy and all the “bunce” they want.
The truth is that the 40-hour week, as
The Bulletin foretold, is a fraud and a
direct germ-carrier of inflation; that
“full employment,” in the “Labor” inter-
pretation, is nothing but a warrant for
loafing and indiscipline on the job ; that
hamstringing of the tried and proven
arbitration system, and the substitution of
the newfangled “conciliators” and special
tribunals, are making hay of all authority
in industry; and that to work for a liv-
ing, once acclaimed a “right” by “Labor,”
is now mocked by “Labor,” terms like
“mug” and “scab” being used.
That is what nearly seven years of
“Labor” rule has done for Australia, and
Mr. Chifley has one last chance now to
assure that it will not be his political
monument.
Mr. Chifley can fly—“dramatically,” as
the press boys cable —to Berlin to “see
for himself” and look the devil in the
face. Why, in six years, has he
never gone to “see for himself” the
northern coalfields? On the evidence of
published statistics, during the past
six years of “Labor” rule (mostly his
own rule) —despite the fact that nearly
four of those years were of grave war
emergency, despite the doubling (and
more) since 1939 of mechanical equipment
underground, despite steadily increased
amounts of open-cut coal elsewhere,
despite an actual increase of some 6 per
cent, in numbers of coal-getting em-
ployees, despite higher wages, special
tribunals, Government control of the
mines, improved conditions of working
and every effort to provide “amenitiesi”
in a hurry, the yearly output of N.S.W.
coal is no greater today than it was in
1939, and the output in tons per man-shift
has steadily fallep with every passing year
of “Labor” government. The man-days of
work lost through strikes in the mines
during “Labor’s” six years in office
amounted to 6330 years. Six years in
office: over 6000 years in man-days of
work lost!
Mr. Chifley from Berlin says he is
going to take “appropriate action, how-
ever drastic.” It is high time he did, even
if only in a mood of deathbed repentance.
Malaya Once More.
Anyone in the mood for seeking relief
from his present discontents in ironic
laughter can get it in large quantities by
turning up Sydney newspaper files for
1937 and ensuing years and reading what
the Oracles wrote about the Storm, when
it was gathering and when it burst.
There is food for laughter especially in
Sydney press accounts of the Eighth
A.I.F. Division in training, though as the
reader reads on the laughter will, turn
bitter until it ceases altogether. About
the middle of 1941 some of the officers
and favored n.c.os., a lady “war” cor-
respondent from the “Women’s Weekly”
reports, are leading “glamorous” lives in
the mansions of Chinese millionaires,
but “other ranks,” as viewed by a parcel
of little editors, are in a distressful
condition. They are short of beer- and
girl-money, sporting materials and
picture-shows, and are a prey to dhoby
itch and “bloody-mindedness,” the latter
a condition brought,on by the inescap-
able sight of rubber-trees. But a Sydney
Sunday paper charges into print with a
balm for all their “pain.”
War comes to Malaya; and, the
tragedy over, but not the peril, the
“Daily Telegraph” gives us the benefit of
its strategy; “Fight for Australia in
Java!”
Fortunately, the rush of events pre-
vents full acceptance of “this basic prin-
ciple of our strategy,” to which “several
editors of leading newspapers” com-
mitted themselves, according to Mr.
Joe Harsch, of the “Christian Science
Monitor” —then in Sydney and delighted
with his reception as a savior—but part
of the Seventh Division, homing from
the Middle East, is landed in Java and
lost, except for those who survived the
hopeless fight and the terrible captivity.
The “Telegraph” strategists are not
dismayed. They continue to issue in-
structions to the incompetents directing
the war. They hurl scorn at General
Percival (“the Japs made him one of the
outstanding flops of 1942”); and so, mis-
led by Communist “reports,” does the
“Sunday Sun,” accusing him of igno-
minious behavior at the capitulation.
Though General Percival, to save* his
soldiers from massacre, had to obey
Yamashita’s demand that he present him-
self at Japanese H.Q. as “parlementaire,”
he did nothing mean or base; nothing
that departed from the standards laid
down in “Hague Rules” for a com-
mander who has had to accept defeat.
Actually, it would seem, the Communists
diluted the draught that came to the
“Sunday Sun” so that it would be swal-
lowed. The full poison was administered
to the public through a pamphlet, A Year
of People's War, by W. A. Wood, with
preface by Rupert Lockwood, who re-
cently set out for Commoland with a
“Labor”-issued passport; and this was
the foulest dose:
General Percival was photographed by
gleeful Japanese pressmen advancing with
a white flag in one hand and a Union
Jack in the other to surrender his army
of 80,000 men to Yamashita.
The “in one hand” and “in the other”
were foul concoctions. In a “Time”
photograph a color-sergeant carries the
Jack and a trumpeter the white flag. If
a photograph of the general bearing both
flags exists it must have been faked, as
would have been easy—faked by Jap-
anese for circulation in Asian countries
or by Russians for distribution among
English-speaking Communists; most
probably by both. And most probably
the gloating Communists in these parts
got theirs from Vladivostok. During the
war in which Russia was neutral till the
last'few days the Japs let Soviet ships go
to San Francisco and come to Sydney
without molestation, passengers (at least
one notorious “Australian” Communist
among them) as well.
Another extract from the pamphlet per-
petrated by Wood, one of those “creep-
ing creatures, venomous and low”:
One episode lit the gloom of Singapore’s
decline and fall. The Government restored
legality to the local branch of the Kuo-
min-tang, previously banned to please the
Japanese. It also recognised and armed the
Communist party. As these drove off
through the city to fight to the death they
sang a Chinese war-song: “Arise, arise,
those who do not want to be slaves. Build
a great new world with your flesh and
blood.” The British commanders were
not built that way.
This evil stuff was fabricated in
Sydney, doubtless on “information”
supplied from the usual quarter, and
though at the time it may have served its
purpose, as! an appeal from knaves to
fools, it now affords sinister evidence of
the sympathies and associations of the
gang to which Wood belongs. No Aus-
tralian then in Singapore saw Wood’s
heroes drive through the doomed city
(in what conveyances?) “to fight to the
death” or was uplifted by their “war
song” or heard of their doing any fight-
ing at any time. Every Australian who
stayed on in or returned to Malaya has
bitter cause to know that they survived
the occupation and turned from revolu-
tionary strikes to armed revolt, aimed at
setting up “a Soviet State” and marked
by Oriental ferocities of murder and
rapine at the expense of whites and
Kuo-min-tang Chinese alike.
A letter from one of these Australians
to The Bulletin :
At a meeting of planters, many from
isolated and threatened parts and a large
proportion Australians, we were told, on
the authority of a resident commissioner,
that Commissioner-General MacDonald had
asked the Australian Government for auto-
matic weapons so that threatened planters
and miners might defend themselves. The
reply was that, as many of the persons who
would be concerned in the packing and
export of the weapons were on the same
side as the killers, the Australian Gov-
ernment regretted that it could not help.
Horrible, but all too probable. It
would be a natural sequel to the craven
fear of Communists which “Labor” has
exhibited all along and in every field ; in
particular, to its cowardly connivance in
the Communist war on the Dutch in their
East Indies, to its failure to exact retribu-
tion for the murder of three Australian
officers by “our Indernesian comrades”
(it did not even try) and, in the latest of
many instances, to its accrediting of the
Communist president Sharkey to the
Indian Communist-party conference, from
which, given marching orders by the
Indian Government, he cast up in Singa-
pore. Even the expulsion of Malayan
seamen has, among effects damaging to
Australia and Australians, weakened the
British: position in Malaya by admitting
of its being alleged that they were ex-
pelled because they were loyal to Britain,
as most of the Malays are.
“The terrorist outbreak in Malaya,” said
the Commissioner-General on July 7, “is
part of a Communist plan to seize power
and establish government by murderers
for murderers.” Supporting this state-
ment Colonial Secretary Creech Jones re-
ferred in the Commons to “the vilification
of Britain and the wilful lies put across
from Moscow,” source of every hateful
thing going on in Asia and Europe, add-
ing that “the situation in Malaya is
grave.” Grave it is, and it is a situation
in which the Administration at Canberra
should intervene with warships capable
of furnishing stout landing parties, a
force of volunteers and all the bombers
it can spare. If no other consideration
occurs to it, if it is unmoved by what the
Eighth Division fought and suffered for
and by the threat to British supremacy, it
has a plain duty to protect the lives of
the Australians who are in danger and
the great Australian interests they serve.
But acceptance of the duty would call
for courage and energy, and in its rela-
tions with Communists during its seven
years in office “Labor” has never shown
a particle of either.
Britain's Grim Task.
Voluntarily or involuntarily, Mr.
Chifley has agreed to a “co-ordination of
efforts” with Britain for economic re-
covery. The British position in all its
stark reality was given to the House of
Commons by Sir Stafford Cripps two days
before Mr. Chifley arrived in London.
The gravity of the emergency had been
outlined three months earlier by the
Attlee Government’s Economic Survey,
of which the kernel was this:
Without external aid by midsummer [t.e.,
now] there would have to be damaging cuts
in food and raw material which would
progressively weaken our whole economy
and bring “wholesale unemployment, dis-
tress, and dislocation of our production.”
Cripps set out the elements of the posi-
tion thus, and showed that it entailed
“disinflation,” suppressing the black-
market and “intelligence in the de-
mocracy” :
By one means or another we must see that
we do not draw further on gold and dollar
reserves. That is the basis of our planning.
These reserves stand at £473 millions.
During the past six months the drain on
our reserves, disregarding E.R.P. aid, was
£254 millions —£147 millions in the first
quarter, £lO7 millions in the second. The
first E.R.P. payment received, part re-
imbursement for purchases in the second
quarter, was dollars equal to £22 millions.
Total grants for that quarter would be
£75 millions, and the maximum amount
offered as loan for the quarter was £25
millions equivalent.
If prices in the dollar area continued to
soar, and were followed (as they
would be) by prices in other parts of the
world, we should find our reserve position
more difficult and have to cut dollar im-
ports.
We must also avoid getting into a severe
unbalance with the non-dollar world.
The Budget surplus would help in “dis-
inflation.”
Challenged on this term, Cripps; said
“disinflation” was “the reduction of an
undesirable degree of inflation to a point
considered currently necessary or desir-
able,” while “deflation” was “not merely
the removal of undesirable inflation but
the creation of a positive degree of de-
flation below the normal in order to gain
some particular end.” Oh for the
language of a Churchill in interpreting
these Socialists’ economic jargon!
Cripps continued with the story;
As much restraint will b'e required [in
checking rises, including wages] as was
necessary three months ago when the White
Paper on [limiting] prices, profits and per-
sonal incomes was published. The response
had been proof of the intelligence of pur
democracy.
We have undertaken to see that the
commodities and services provided are not
misused, and goods are kept off the black-
market.
We have agreed to maintain “a valid
rate of exchange.” The important word,
so far as we are concerned, is “a,” especi-
ally in view of what is happening in some
countries.
Then followed a conditional acknow-
ledgment—highly significant considering
what is happening in Malaya —that
Malaya was among those colonial Gov-
ernments which had not at that date
acceded to the agreement (but was ex-
pected to do so), and that it was also one
of the territories whose non-adherence
within a reasonable period would be re-
garded by the U.S.A. as a matter of
major importance, entitling U.S.A. to
discontinue aid to Britain. This is be-
cause it is one of “those territories which
are the principal producers of strategic
raw materials which U.S.A. might wish
to acquire.”
Here is a picture of the state to which
three years of socialisation has brought
proud Britain —weakened as a result of
the war effort, but not that much. It
also suggests the reason for Moscow s
incitement of the violence and destruc-
tion by Communists in Malaya, as also
in France and Italy,
It is against this background, as
drawn by Cripps, that Chifley is due to
announce Australia’s new collaboration
with the Attlee Government in its fight
to avert disaster —for Britain and for us.


PLAIN ENGLISH
It COULD Happen Here.
Land of so many gifts from Beauty’s
dower,
Where after rain the very deserts flower;
Land of majestic, though unbridled,
streams
And vast, not yet exploited, reefs and
seams;
Land of the fleece, the sheepwalks not so
bounded
As when the fleece Old England’s fortune
founded;
Land that has known not what it is to feel
The bondman’s fetter or the conqueror’s
heel —
Your people have it in them to be great;
But they must learn, before it is too late.
That sloth and faction can destroy a State.
“Unite for strength ” — how true the
adjuration,
How true that righteousness exalts a
nation !
France had for each, at most, a dicer’s
oath.
And we could perish for despising both.
Britain shed “blood and tears,” but had
at call
Union and “sweat”—and saved herself,
and all.
Albeit at what a sacrifice and cost,
With India, Burma, Egypt, Palestine lost;
With overseas investments at an end.
Replaced by handouts from a candid
friend ;
With freedoms (not the least of all her
cares)
Assailed by barnacles and doctrinaires.
Withal she’s “England yet”; in purpose
steeled.
To base and paltry things she does not
yield.
Her hungry cities, with their bomb-scarred
points,
Not pockmarked are with crowded lottery
joints;
Her famous press, with cause enough for
fretting,
Disdains to feed the appetite for betting;
And to her 8.8. C., however odd.
The “sport” is not the noblest work of
God.
Her leaders, too, in some respects so raw,
Are strong and steadfast when the rule of
law
Is challenged—as it. was by wharf side
toughs —■
And never crawl to Moscow or its roughs.
How fares A ustralia in these matters ? 111.
Here the Red ruffian works his wicked
will.
Not even scolded, much less brought to
book.
Though easy it would be his goose to
cook:
The means exist, and prime would be the
cuts;
The one thing lacking is essential guts.
Yet, plagued and pushed around by crook
and clown,
The sons of Anzacs take it lying down.
They grumble, and they wonder, but no
more;
For “What’s the use?” they say, and
“What’s the score ?”
“These drinks are mine.” So, ire assuaged,
and thirst,
They hope to “back the card,” or “win a
first.”
Brothers, let not inertia be your bane;
Assert your rights, your liberties regain.
Remember what the Bard, our greatest,
urges:
Our “pleasant vices” can become our
scourges.
We need (as engines oil and woodwork
paint)
“Law, Order, Duty, Discipline, Restraint.”
This is too grand a country to be wrecked
By bullies, loafers, parasites unchecked,
Its story too magnificent to close
In bondage such as serfs on serfs impose,
Yet mark Malaya and its rabble rout.
Aussies, wake up, and throw the rascals
out!
Kogarah.
A by-election of tremendous signifi-
cance ;
If the term “heroic” were not ludicrously
inappropriate to N.S.W. “Labor” in any con-
nection it could be applied with some warrant
to the efforts of that party’s leaders to save
the Kogarah Assembly seat.
By-election week broke badly for them in-
asmuch as theje was a State strike of firemen.
Premier McGirr “settled” it with a show of
sternness, after Dr. Evatt had offered him the
use of 500 Commonwealth Peace Officers during
the “emergency”—an offer and a precedent
which will be remembered in other “emer-
gencies.” This “victory” was followed, though
not till the week-end, by the calling-off of the
gasmen’s overtime strike, which led to the
promise of a bit more gas. Use of radiators
for a couple of hours had been promised on
the previous day, and though it was regretted
that the coal position prevented the running
of special trajns to the races a “special service”
of buses was substituted.
So far so good; and Mr. McGirr sought
to improve the deceptively shining hour by con-
ducting ‘ a large party of official guests,” in “four
special ; carriages coupled to the Newcastle
Express” (the coal position wasn’t too bad for
that) and in special buses, to “open the State
coalmine” at Awaba and “turn the first sod
of the Lake Macquarie power-station.” He
rather spoilt the effect of the ceremony by
admitting that it would be “about five years”
before mine and power-plant were in “full
operation,” there being no plant in either case
a ? . scrapings of the ground, the work
« Mr. McGirr himself when he “fired the
first shot” and toyed with “a silver spade” on
the first sod.” Then a lady protested that
the missionaries were trespassing on private
property, the owner of which hadn’t been
notified. But host and guests were compen-
sated for this interruption, and for any short-
comings felt, by recruiting their exhausted
energies at a Government lunch and listening
to a school choir, which sang “Land of Hope
and Glory” and “Advance Australia Fair.”

Heffron visited the Ramsgate primary school
with the “Labor” candidate, Mr. Oxblood (he
is an Education Department lecturer), promised
the children a grand new school and granted
them a holiday for the rest of the day. This
was not to the taste of two clergymen who
arrived at the emptying school to give scripture
lessons, and who had not been taken into the
Minister’s confidence. Nor could it have been
to the taste of Ramsgate mothers, busy with
their household cares or out shopping. But
Ramsgate is not only part of the Kogarah
electmate but was expected to be the critical
subdivision, so “Laibor” felt that something
had to be done to keep it faithful to the
Cause.
Unfortunately Mr. Maxie Falstein, “Labor”
M.H.R. for Watson, chose that day to draw
invidious attention tQ what was pending.
Charged, in company with an importer and
a Customs man, with violations of the Customs
Act in respect of imports of votches and votch
movements, he said he had “a complete answer”
and regarded the whole thing as “an attempt
to embarrass the Government on the eve of
the Kogarah by-election.” In effect, an accu-
sation against the Commonwealth Solicitor-
General, who is responsible to Dr. Evatt. That
day also “S. M. Herald” had a report of a
Supreme Court case in which Mr. Downing,
the “Labor”- Minister of Justice, secured an
order for the eviction of a cottager, in the
depth of almost the coldest winter on record,
from a Goulburn grazing property—not the
cottager’s, of course, nor the McKells’ estate,
nor the Tullys’, but Mr. Downing’s, the Minister
of Justice.
Saturday was the bitterest July day for 80
years, and, since there is a fellow-feeling in
these matters and Australians are naturally a
kindly people, the thoughts of many Kogarah
electors must have turned to the poor devil
of a Downing tenant. And obviously they had
other feelings and thoughts that sank deep.
For when the numbers went up the “Labor”
candidate was horribly defeated. He con-
fessed defeat, and took it well, while Mr.
McGirr prefaced a characteristic squeal with
an inane profession of hope for a hopeless
recovery. With round 25,000 people voting,
“Labor” majorities of 4762 in 1944 and 3732
in 1947 were converted into a minority of
nearly 900.
It is an omen of ruin for “Labor,” for
Kogarah is more working-class than middle-class.
What is more, it is the centre of a populous
region which during eight years had returned
none but “Labor” members, Federal and State,
among them the two Ministerial Evatts.
Socialisation or Dollars?
Leaving aside the details of whatever
arrangement Mr. Chifley may have made
with the British Ministry, it would seem
that dollar-earning is now his Number
One preoccupation.
What “the co-ordination of efforts of
the United Kingdom and Australia” may
mean the Prime Minister has yet to ex-
plain. He went to London to find out
if dollars were available, and they are
not. He went to see whether he would
be able to buy the capital equipment
from U.S.A. which the Commonwealth’s
industrial development requires—for the
heavy industries’ plans at Kembla and
Whyalla and elsewhere, and for electric
power-plants, and for tooling-up factories
—and he came away saying Australia
must throw herself into producing more
meat and butter and wheat for Britain
and other consumers in the sterling area.
He went to Whitehall to urge that we
should get some consideration from the
dollar pool for the goods we were ex-
porting to Britain which might otherwise
go to America; and he came away con-
vinced that there is no dollar pool to
draw from. Only the Marshall Plan
dollar-dispensary remains.
Mr. Chifley’s London broadcast im-
plied that dollar'imports will have to be
further cut. Their present cost is about
double what our exports earn from the
U.S.A. Whether he means now to try
Professor Copland’s dollar-loan proposal,
or whether that, too, didn’t ring any bell
in London, the country has yet to learn.
But, these points apart, if dollar-earn-
ing, whether under short-range or long-
range plans, now holds first place, has
socialisation been shelved? Mr. Chifley’s
broadcast from London dwelt upon hard
work by all, “the stern responsibility of
every Australian if we are to survive” —
highest possible production with what
system and machines and working energy
we have at hand. He is not going to get
these results if he means to throw the
community into strife and dissension by
persisting with socialisation of the trad-
ing banks; nor will he get an all-out
drive for production unless he cuts down
hard on Government expenditure and the
growth of his swollen departments, and
also upon his exorbitant taxation imposts.
Socialisation requires the maintenance of
both these burdens.
In plain language, the crazy socialisa-
tion experiment must go if we are to
haul ourselves out of the present mess.
The Bank Grab Act and an effective
response to a call for united hard work
and increased output will not run to-
gether.
.Which is it to be—dollar-earning or
socialisation?
The Luck Turns.
Situation in the Speck:
Five-year Parliaments and Proportional Re-
presentation have served Tasmanian “Labor”
well as a party, whatever the consequences to
the electors, for many years. By the irony of
events, they are at length forcing it to face
the people at a very unwelcome Assembly elec-
tion which three-year Parliaments and pro-
vision for by-elections could have averted.
The last election was held on November 23,
1946. It gave “Labor” 16 of the 30 seats;
it was previously 20-10. One of the 16 mem-
bers was Dr. Turnbull, who fell into the
habit, unusual for a Labor politician, of
speaking his mind in public, and thus became
“difficult.” Dr. Turnbull made it known that
he had no use for what he called “backdoor
methods of bringing about nationalisation
of road transport.” The Legislative Council,
for its part, refused to vote £367,000 for “Gov-
ernment transport undertakings.”
Then Assembly Opposition-leader Campbell
produced a statement in which a “road
operator” alleged that he and two other “road
operators” had paid Premier Cosgrove £lBOO
a year for three years as a guarantee against
being “put off the roads.” The Premier denied
the payments and the promise.
Meanwhile the party’s one seat in the Council
became vacant, Mines Minister McDonald hav-
ing died. He was succeeded as member by
Mr. D’Alton, a former Minister of Forests and
Commonwealth representative in N.Z., who, as
a result of a royal commissioner’s report, had
figured in the dock on a charge of having, when

AS THE YEARS ROLL ON.
“With a great display of ceremony N. S. Wales Premier McGirr last week turned a sod and ‘fired a shot’ on what might or might
not eventually be sites for a powerhouse and a new State coalmine at Awaba.”
“At last! Some Awaba coal!”
“No, no, Mr. McGirr. Don’t you recognise it? It’s that sod you turned away back in 1948!”

We are bound, without personalities or
bitterness, to face up to the situation
created by the trial of the Premier. There
were certain admitted facts which must give
us food for serious thought.
The Premier was in charge of a special
secret fund, which was systematised to the
extent of books being kept. Gifts were
received from bookmakers, a certain Mr
Fitz Patrick, who had need to obtain licences
for the sale of Tattersall’s tickets, and
licensed victuallers. This practice is wrong,
and has a vicious tendency. The present
want of confidence is due to the atmosphere
of suspicion that remains.
We must deal with the politician on the
same footing as we would deal with a
public servant. In England even a breath
of suspicion is sufficient to disqualify.
The fullest disclosure and the greatest
frankness were called for from the Gov-
ernment. Instead, it chose to draw a veil
over those events.
The conscience of the Commonwealth has
been deeply stirred by several such events
in recent years. The issue is simply the
moral integrity of public life, and the
people should be allowed to decide.
So the “Government” that looked forward
to another five years of office without inter-
ruption will have to put its fortune to the
touch, in very adverse circumstances, within
21 months of its return. Yet if Mr, Cosgrove
could have gone to a by-election and been
re-elected he would have had a fair excuse
for returning to his Premiership and trying
to hang on.
POLITICAL POINTS
To the Canberra and Sydney “Labor”
parties there was a colder place thain
Kosciusko on Saturday—Kogarah.
A bit of Hurstville, broken off from the
constituency which McGirr’s pet, C.
Evatt, of “Russia and Us” notoriety, re-
presents, is in the Kogarah electorate and
it used to be pre-eminently “Labor.” Vot-
ing on Saturday was 412 for Oxford
(“Labor”) and 588 for Cross (Liberal).
Apropos, C. Evatt is to run a gardening
competition for tenants of Housing Com-
mission cottages with cash prizes. Any-
body who grows raspberries will be dis-
qualified.
What a mean and miserable mind Ded-
man has! Just as the Government of his
State was bringing in legislation to take
control of prices and land sales, Dedman
rapped out the threat that the States
would be refused subsidies on inter-State
shipping and clothing materials. “The
people were told what a ‘No’ vote would
mean,” he sneered. They weren’t told
that, nor would Dedman’s fainthearted
crowd have dared to tell them that.
Withdrawal of the subsidies of which
Dedman pronounced the doom (if he
really speaks for his mob) would mean
a steep rise in prices of wearing apparel,
sugar and all other necessaries carried
by inter-State ships which, because of
Communist strikes and go-slow, spend
most of their time in ports. Naturally
the poor would suffer most; but what
does “Labor” care for the poor? Illogi-
cal as well as heartless, Dedman made
no promise of tax-reduction equivalent to
the amount of subsidy money “saved.”
On the contrary, he tried, in his disin-
genuous way, to justify the terrific taxa-
tion and the prodigious and incessantly
increasing number of barnacles feeding
on it.
Going to Cairns, Brisbane’s Lud Mayor
Chandler announced his support for a
North Queensland State —for three States
in fact: North, Centre and South. Obvi-
ously Chandler has been studying Ameri-
can history with profit and making per-
tinent comparisons.
The P.M. came back with the report
that “it is going to be a long, hard road
ahead 'in regard to the availability of
dollars.” Does this mean that when the
second fleet of Ministerial super-cars, all
American, is worn out the boys will take
to English jobs for the “long, hard road”
from Canberra to Sydney and Mel-
bourne?
Most of Sydney awoke last Sunday
morning to grey skies, freezing winds and
sleety rain. Those .whose business took
them abroad were convinced that the
chilly winds came from the south. Three
citizens, a Mr. McGirr, a Dr. Evatt and
a Mr. C. Evatt, felt most keenly the blast
that blew their way from Kogarah.
Kogarah election drama in three acts:
Act 1. —May 3, 1947, “Labor” retains seat
by 3732 votes. Figures in Ramsgate sub-
division: “Labor” 1635, Liberal 981.
Act 2. —July 16, 1948. Education Minister
Heffron and “Labor” candidate Oxford visit
Ramsgate Primary School and promised to
build a new school, “the best in the Southern
Hemisphere.” Grant children a half-holiday.
Act 3. —July 17, 1948. “Labor” loses seat
by close on 900 votes. Figures in Ramsgate
subdivision: “Labor” 1601, Liberal 1379.
Flashback. —One Ramsgate mother to another
the night before the poll: “What do the
mugs think they’re doing? Here’s me in the
middle of my cleaning and three kids land
home with muddy boots and say they don’t
have to go back ’cos Heifron’s given them
a half-holiday. Gas restrictions, power ration-
ing, no this, no that, and to top it all they
bung this on us. Half-holiday! I’ll show
them tomorrow what I think of ’em!”
Motor-trucks are taking 1000 tons of
wheat per day from the N.S.W. north-
west to waiting ships at Newcastle. It
means about 2s. a bushel less for the
grower, but there was no other means of
getting 1947-48 wheat out of the way be-
fore the next harvest comes in ; the rail-
ways couldn’t do the job through lack of
coal and trucks. Pollard was positive
there would be no difficulty in handling
1947-48 wheat.
Unable to get Eisenhower, the Demo-
crats have nominated Truman for Presi-
dent and Barkley for Vice-President.
Truman comes from Missouri, which has
never had an elected President, and
Barkley from Kentucky, which is in the
same boat, though there were two Ken-
tuckian v.-ps. in the last century —R. M.
Johnson (1837-1841) and Breckinridge
(1857-1861). Even if the Democrats’
record were not against them, the fact
that Dewey is a New Yorker, like the two
Roosevelts and Cleveland, and Warren a
Californian, like Hoover, would give the
Republicans a tremendous advantage.
Sir Laurence Olivier doesn’t seem to
care for McGirr’s favorite Minister, the
younger Evatt. Asked to give his blessing
to the Evatt-Haylen project of a “national
theatre,” he politely refused it. Asked
again, by Evatt (Haylen is in Japan), to
“select a Sydney site” for the thing, which
would use up heaps of building materials
needed to give servicemen shelter (and
Evatt is Minister for Housing) he refused
again, “with as much firmness as pos-
sible.” Perhaps the English actor has been
reading the house organ of the Aus-
tralian-Russian Society (Evatt is local
president), which lauds Russia in such
terms as that “she has freed almost more
colonial races than Britain has ever sub-
jected.”
The circus known as the A.C.T.U.
executive has billed “nationalisation” as
“the real solution of the coal problem”—
“nationalisation” and the 35-hour week,
Britain has had “nationalisation” and the
five-day week for 18 months, and after
taking a third of the period to work out
the losses for 12 months the National
Coal Board gave them as £23,255,500.
Another 4s. a ton was put on the price
to the consumer, but rise in cost of pro-
duction was 4s. 3d.; “the prevalence
of unofficial strikes” and “a poor atten-
dance at the coal face,” compared with
“attendance before the war,” accounted
for the rest. As for “new collieries,” the
McGirr “remedy,” depreciation and in-
terest will run away with “ss. per ton of
coal mined.” In fine, “the outlook for
the industry, and for those who earn a
living from it, is bleak indeed.” “Nation-
alisation the real solution” ; that and 25
hours’ less exertion every week—l27s
hours per man per year. What makes
these imbeciles think they can get away
with such insults to the public intelli-
gence?
Discovering that there are “thousands
of unionists in the Kogarah electorate,”
W. H. Spooner, the Liberals’ president,
chose to address them on election-eve in
these terms:
A Liberal victory would be a clear-cut
instruction to Labor to embrace again the
old principles that made the Labor move-
ment successful.
“Yeronner,” the bullying barrister com-
plained, “did you hear witness mumble
that I am a blackguard?” The reply from
the Bench was “Witness, don’t mumble! ”
Spooner, don’t snuffle!
Pollard has been delivered of another
“wheat-stabilisation scheme.” This time
he offers growers 6s. 3d. a bushel for five
years, but it is not a “firm” guarantee;
the price is to “vary according to index of
production costs each season.” And there
is to be an old-style “stabilisation fund,”
financed by an export tax of 50 p.c. of
the difference between guaranteed and ex-
port price, with a limit of 2s. 2d. Com-
monwealth “liability” is also to be limited
to 160,000,000 bushels a year. The States
have to “ratify” the thing, and growers
are eyeing it in much the same manner
as a man eyes an insect which may or
may not bite.
Queensland Judge Mansfield, fining a
unionist £2O for common assault in a
case arising out of the railway strike,
said the word “scab” should be pro-
hibited by law ; and so it should be. It is
a deadly weapon in the armory of Com-
munists exploiting natural fears and
mateship and trading on sectarianism, as
they do.
Though Italy is in a bad way,
financially and industrially, and though
over-population remains an unsolved
problem, there is good hope for the
country now that it has been proved to
have what N. S. Wales and the Common-
wealth so signally lack, an understand-
ing Government that governs.
A Sicilian shot the Communist leader
Togliatti (he has had other names), and
Togliatti’s confederates ordered a general
strike as a prelude to revolution. It was
nearly that; from Turin to Naples mobs
rushed into the streets, broke into prisons
and newspaper offices and took control
of factories, workshops’, cities and towns.
The Gasperi Government ordered troops
and police to protect decent people, pub-
lic buildings and transport, and this they
did most effectually. After two days the
Reds, who had been fortified by a mes-
sage from Stalin, realised that the game
was up, and, the general strike called off,
the mobs dissolved and streamed back to
work. Calm in the moment of victory,
Premier de Gasperi said his Government
would introduce “anti-strike legislation.”
Last month 120 minor clerks were
counted in the stalled “free-medicine”
department at Canberra. They were wait-
ing to tot-up the monthly statements of
Government payments for “free” pre-
scriptions and are still waiting, there
being nothing to tot-up.
Australia can earn more dollars by in-
creasing pig-iron exports to America.
From Whyalla (S.A.) this year 30,000
tons of pig-iron went on U.S. orders,
and a lot more could follow it, only
shortage of coal forbids. If the miners
had permitted, output of steel ingots
and castings in this country last year
would have challenged Canada’s for
second place in the Empire.
While B.H.P. lives from hand to
mouth for coal, Rylands and Lysaghts
must in turn wait for the material for
wire, wire-netting and corrugated-iron;
steel shipments for all States are banking
up on Newcastle wharves, held there by
shipping delays, and factories of every
kind that use it are starved in turn. At
the far end of the line of frustration
stand wheatgrowers, who did such a
grand job last year. “Because of the
shortage of farm machinery at least 30
per cent, less land will be sown to wheat
in N.S.W. this season” —so it was said
by farmers met in conference to protest
at the hold-ups.
According to “Truth” a small host of
more or less Important People interested
itself in the case (B. 14/7/’4B) in which a
soldier-plumber thrashed a city lout found
on a bed with the soldier-plumber’s
fiancee, and contributed to the lad’s being
brought to trial and having to face heavy
costs for his successful defence. And
“Truth” attributes this statement to the
Gollan who is “Labor” member for
Randwick, apropos of the police-
sergeant’s objection to a prosecution:
I’ll take the matter up in the House. I’ll
see my friend the Commissioner and see
that he takes action. If he refuses, I’ll
make it a matter for Parliament to decide!
After this, the Liberal Gollan (Parra-
matta) should assuredly “take the matter
up in the House.”
U.N.O. claims to have brought off a
cease-fire truce in Palestine, and, super-
ficially, this seems to be a fact. But the
spadework was done by the Swedish
Count Bernadette, descendant of one of
Napoleon’s marshals and a leader of the
Red Cross. The Red Cross (may its in-
fluence become universal!) stands for the
hope of humanity: mercy, pity and peace.
U.N.O. is founded on the fallacy that you
can prevent war by threatening it or, in
the last resort, making war yourself.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Adelaide ’Varsity will be farewelling
two more professors at the end of the
year, John Burton Cleland, the pathology
prof,, and Garnet Vere Portus, whose
province is political science and history.
Cleland stems back to the early days of
the State; his father was S.A.’s Colonial
Surgeon and his grandfather Registrar-
General. The son took his medical
degrees at Sydney Uni. at the beginning
of the century, visited China and Japan,
was the first Australian to gain the
diploma of the London School of Tropi-
cal Medicine and was Cancer Research
Scholar at London Hospital before taking
on the job of Government Pathologist
and Bacteriologist in Perth in 1906. After
three years in the West he went to Sydney
and put in six years as microbiologist
in the Public Health department, coming
to Adelaide as Professor of Pathology in
1919. He has been President of the Royal
Society in both New South Wales and
South Australia. Outside his own particu-
lar branches of science he is interested in
anthropology, botany and ornithology;
he has led scientific expeditions to
Central Australia and is deputy-chairman
of the Aborigines Protection Board.
Professor Portus was N.S.W. Rhodes
Scholar in 1907. At Oxford he graduated
B.A. and B.Litt. and played Rugby
Union for England against Ireland and
France. He has occupied the History
chair in Adelaide since 1934, but 20
years before that he was there for a
while as acting-professor of History and
English. After that he was a military
censor and for 16 years was lecturer
in Economic History and Director of
Tutorial Classes at Sydney Uni. Portus
has always been a prominent figure in
the Workers’ Educational Association and
the Students’ Christian Union; he has
written a string of historical and socio-
logical works and has the knack of com-
bining commonsense and knowledge in
popular radio talks.
Back in Australia after 20 years in
London as a sort of theatrical agent-
general, Nevin Tait has bought more
Virtuosi, musical comedies, operas and
other entertainments over the counter
than any other Australian, Over the
years he has been instrumental in get-
ting singers like Melba, Clara Butt, Galli-
Curci, John McCormack, Chaliapin,
Richard Crooks, Lawrence Tibbett, a
long string of fiddlers and pianists, from
Paderewski to Menuhin, dancers like
Pavlova and a posse of Russian ballets,
the Grenadier Guards’ band and Harry
Lauder to cross the ocean. He comes
back as envoy for the Italian opera com-
pany, and he estimates it will cost £lOOO
for each performance. Grand opera has
never been a profitable enterprise in Aus-
tralia, and on one occasion the Firm lost
£20,000 on a venture, though houses were
packed and the season was a triumph.
The Melbourne season opens on August
14 with 120 performers and with Signor
Franco Ghione wielding the baton. There
will be 17 operas, and audiences’ hearts
will throb to all the old motives, from
Mimi dying of consumption to Aida being
walled up in her Egyptian coffin. No
new operas will be presented.
Dr L. D. A. Hussey, ship’s doctor
aboard the British freighter Clan Macau-
lay, now in Melbourne, has strong asso-
ciations with Australia. He accompanied
Shackleton on his 1914 and 1922 expedi-
tions, Hubert Wilkins and Douglas Maw-
son on other trips, and he is entitled to
wear the Polar Star, one of the world’s
rarest decorations. He is the man who
buried Shackleton. It was on South
Georgia, and the “soil” was solid ice.
The cairn and cross he and his mates
erected over the body of the explorer still
serve as a landmark. Since his Antarctic
days Dr. Hussey has been a g.p. in Lon-
don,
When Tom Hollway was Minister for
Public Instruction in the Victorian Gov-
ernment in 1943-45 he remarked that the
portfolio was a full-time job for one man.
As Premier he has so much respect for
the capacity of Colonel Wilfred Selwyn.
Kent Hughes, M.V.0., M.C., 8.A., that
he has loaded not only Education but
Transport on to his shoulders. Kent
Hughes has a lot of the drive of his
father, who was one of Melbourne’s most
distinguished and most picturesque
surgeons—he ran second in the half-
mile championship of the world in 1888
and managed a hospital in Russia during
the 1914 war. The son was a leading
rower, head of Christchurch, Oxford—
he was Rhodes Scholar for 1914 —was

POLITICIAN AND SOLDIER.
Lacrosse Club. He won his M.C. with the
Bth Light Horse and emerged a major
from World War I, represented Australia
in the Olympic Games in 1920, entered
Parliament in 1927 and got leave of
absence to go with the Eighth Division in
1941 to Malaya, While p.-0.-w. for 3j
years he wrote his Slaves of the Samurai,
an epic poem of 60,000 words written
on tiny scraps of paper and hidden
in various queer places. He pub-
lished the work after his release, as a
companion volume to his Modern
Crusaders, written after the first war.
A soldier departs:
During the war, when names like Marshall,
Eisenhower, MacArthur and Patton held the
headlines, John Joseph Pershing’s name faded
into the background of history; so much so
that when cables reported his death last
week many people were probably surprised
to find that the man who led the American
Army in the First World War had outlived
most of the leaders of that conflict. Yet in
1919 his prestige was as high in America as
that of any of the generals of the more recent
scrap; so high, indeed, that his country con-
ferred on him the rank of General of the
Armies of the United States, which had pre-
viously been held by only four men —Washing-
ton, Grant, Sherman and Sheridan. Born at
Laclede, Missouri, in 1860, he won a scholar-
ship to West Point, graduated in 1886 and saw
service with the 6th Cavalry in the Indian
risings in Arizona and Dakota. He fought in
Cuba in the Spanish-American war of 1898
and a few years later went to the Philippines,
where he made such a name for himself as
soldier and administrator that Theodore Roose-
velt promoted him from captain to brigadier-
general over the heads of 862 senior officers.
While military attache to the U.S. Embassy
in Tokyo he went to Manchuria with General
Kuroki’s army and observed the closing cam-
paigns of the Russo-Japanese war.
In 1914 Pershing was given command of the
Bth Brigade in California, and shortly after-
wards took charge of the forces on the Mexican
border, which was at that time Uncle Sam’s
chief trouble-spot. This assignment involved
an expedition into Mexico chasing Pancho Villa.
It wasn’t very successful, but by that time
America had entered the European war and
Pershing was sent to France in command of the
American Expeditionary Force. There has been
much controversy over the effect on the Allied
cause of his insistence on maintaining an in-
dependent American Army instead of placing
the Doughboys unreservedly at Foch’s disposal,
but his own country had no doubt about the
correctness of his decision. There was little
glamor about Pershing, but he possessed driving
force and organising ability and he built up
the American Army virtually from scratch.
After the Armistice and demobilisation he had
much the same job to do over again in blue-
print form; as Chief-of-Staff he drew up plans
for the permanent framework of the U.S.
Army.
“T.P.”: Still absorbed in his legal prac-
tice, George H. Wise, pioneer Gipps-
lander, doyen of Australian solicitors,
legislator and whole-souled Australian,
went from Sale to spend his 95th
birthday in the head office of the A.N.A,
as trustee, discussing a big forward move.
The association has owed much to the
veteran, as it heartily recognises. When
Wise was Postmaster-General his chief
executive officer went into his office one
day to prime him for his visit to Europe
for an international conference and began
to stress the importance of certain matters
to be dealt with there. Wise snapped
“I have plenty of work to do here, I’m
not going!” “But the Minister must
represent Australia, sir,” protested the
officer. “You go. You have inside
knowledge. I haven’t,” replied his chief.
The real expert went, and did admirable
work. That’s old-fashioned. Nowadays
a Minister, no matter what the depth of
his ignorance, goes abroad —often with
a daughter or niece as secretary, his wife
and a few others —and John Citizen foots
the bill.
“Sixth Soldier,” from behind the foot-
lights of the Old Vic.:
For “Richard, III” there are six Australians
employed in the cast as soldiers. They are
changed at each of the capital cities, but the
courtesy of Olivier never varies. He meets the
supers personally and thanks them for “help-
ing out,” At the matinee when he injured
his knee there was a preceding mishap which
caused almost as much consternation. As one
of the company put it, “They’ve lost the boss’s
sword.” The boss, instead of sitting and wait-
ing for the instrument to materialise, joined
in the flurried search, so that at least one Aus-
tralian was shocked while making up to see
the grim features of Richard peer around the
door of the dressing-room and inquire whether
the sword had been left there. When the
doctors had examined his injured knee Olivier
was forced to make alterations during the per-
formance. Thus while the audience was rest-
ing at interval, members of the cast were
sweating through variations to “get them up”
before the curtain rose for the second half.
One of the surest tests for an actor is his
ability to rise above setbacks like these, and
in this as in every other aspect of his art
Sir Laurence has shown himself a master.
Canadian Dr. W. Gibson, M.D., Ph,D„
sketched here by Prior, is that rare medical
bird a clinical pathologist—a “doctor’s
doctor.” Where the surgeon answers his
problem with cold steel, the pathologist,
with the removed tissue under his micro-
scope, checks the surgeon’s answer with
cold fact. Out from Montreal for lectur-
ing and research in mental diseases at
Sydney Uni., Gibson studied neurology
in Spain, Germany and Russia before
joining the R.C.A.F., for which he
carried out research on a cure
for plane- and seasickness, the
latter to keep invasion troops in trim
while surfing in landing barges. With
12,000 patients in N.S.W.’s mental homes,
and cost for their custody tremendous,
Gibson would like to see a research lab.
and diagnostic centre for brain injuries
set up in Sydney, on the lines of the
famous McGill Neurological Institute in
PATHOLOGIST.
Montreal —spending money to save
mone,y. With psychiatrists booked out
weeks ahead, the importance of Gibson’s
work as a neuropathologist is obvious.
He was first sold on Australia by Jack
Eccles, his Sydney-born tutor at Oxford,
and later came into favorable contact
with many Australians of the Empire Air
Training Scheme.
Cyril F. Uwins, 0.8. E., A.F.C., at pre-
sent visiting Australia, is managing-
director of the aircraft division of the
Bristol Aeroplane Company. He served
with the R.F.C. in World War I, and
joined Bristol Co. as chief test-pilot in
1919, Flying a Vickers Vespa with a
Bristol Pegasus engine, he collected the
altitude record of 43,976 ft. in 1932,
and in the same year was awarded the
Britannia Trophy and the first award of
the British Silver Medal for Aeronautics.
A Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical
Society, Uwins: is a quiet retiring bloke
from whom it is almost impossible to
drag any information; the only an-
nouncement he has made since arriving
in Australia is that his firm is working
on an airliner which will outclass the
Constellations and replace them by
1954.
A Hugh Chisholm once edited the
Encyclopedia Britannica. An Alec of the
same name though not the same family
will edit the Australian Encyclopedia, a
quarter-of-a-century job which will make
its initial bow in a five-volume edition
five years hence. Alec Chisholm has
probably done more editing than any
scribe in Australia. Who’s Who in Aus-
tralia, the Victorian Naturalist, the
Queensland Naturalist, the Emu, the Mel-
bourne “Argus,” the “Australasian,” the
Sydney “Sunday Pictorial” and a host of
other weeklies, monthlies, quarterlies and
annuals have passed under his blue pencil.
In addition he has published original
works ranging from Bird Wonders of
Australia to The Making of a Sentimental
Bloke , his tribute to his old friend C. J.
Dennis. He gained the Australian
Natural History medallion in 1940.
A native of Dunedin (M.L.), of which
he is now Mayor, Donald Cameron col-
lected a knighthood in last month’s birth-
day honors. Born 71 years ago, he started
with the engineering firm of Reid and
Grey as office-boy and became a director.
In 1906 he entered suburban politics, be-
coming a councillor for the borough of
St. Kilda, and later Mayor. After amal-
gamation of the suburbs he was elected to
the City Council; he became Mayor in
1944. Twelve years ago he retired from
business and made the job of Mayor of
Dunedin a whole-time one. “Tonal” was
re-elected last year with a majority of
12,000 votes. His knighthood comes in
Dunedin’s centennial year.
Australian Squadron-Leader H. B.
(“Mick”) Martin, D.S.O. and bar,
D.F.C. and two bars, who piloted a Mos-
quito as pathfinder for the initial jet
flight across the Atlantic, was a member
of the famous 617 Squadron, but despite
his long experience he found this last
job the most exacting; he had to fly
ahead of the jets, informing them of the
weather conditions. In May, 1947,
Martin set a new Lopdon-Capetown
record of 21 hours 31 minutes, clipping
10 hours' 50 minutes off the previous best.
Into the silence;
In Sydney, at 78, Ernest C. Andrews, a
world authority on physiography and N.S.W.
Government Geologist from 1920-31. He led
the Australian delegation at the Pacific Science
Congresses in Java (1929), Canada (1933) and
U.S.A. (1939), held offices in the Australasian
Association for the Advancement of Science
for many years and was its president 1930-32,
and won scientific awards in this country, New
Zealand, Britain and America. He published
several books; the last; The Eternal Goodness,
was received from the printer the day before
he died.
In Melbourne, at 98, August Frederick
Beker, doyen of Melbourne’s Bonifaces. Born
at Danzig, Beker was a keen sport, and until
recent years was seen at Flemmgton and the
M.C.G., of both of which clubs he was the oldest
member. At various times he managed the
Grand, Windsor and White Hart, where he met
the leading politicians of the day.
At Tweed Heads (N.S.W.), at 82, Charles
Morley, a Cornishman who came to Australia
in 1886, opened up as a chemist in Mackay
and in 1900 becatme Mayor of the sugar town.
In 1910 he moved to Tweed Heads and estab-
lished Morley’s Ltd., a firm of general mer-
chants.
In Adelaide, at 58, Edward Wilckens, past-
president of the S.A. Builders and Contractors’
Association and its representative on the Re-
construction Training Scheme for ex-service-
men. He was a member of Kensington and
Norwood Council.
At Bendigo (Vic.), Mrs. Polglase, who was
a baby in arms when her mother, Mrs.
Margaret Kennedy, scooped a heap of gold
out of a nearby creek and stored it in a stocking
and a quartpot. A State Parliamentary Com-
mittee subsequently recognised her as one of the
discoverers of the metal in Victoria.

“Hist”: There is a touch of the ap-
propriate about the names of some of
these Commo newspapers. The simple
Czech bravos have their “Rude Pravo”;
and in Trieste, if my local rag is to be
believed, all true-blue Reds on their way
to work bury their noses in “II Lavora-
tore.”

“Conda”: What’s all this about short-
ages? Went to a party last night, called for
by my host’s conveyance and helped into it
by its driver with a polite “Mind the step,
sir.” While Sydney shivered, was shown
into a room lit by eight electric-light
bulbs and warmed by a huge electric
radiator. Counted five open packets of
cigarettes of a good brand on the occa-
sional-table, and horrified my host by
opening one of my own, saved from
last week for the occasion. With a
“Can’t do that, old man ; and, anyway, I
get ’em for sevenpence,” was given a fag,
the packet pushed suggestively nearer,
and at the touch of a bell a waiter ap-
peared with a foaming tankard. “Cold
enough, sir?” Then dinner, piping hot
from its electric heater. Followed port,
liqueurs and more tankards; and, at
leisurely midnight, “Mind the step, sir.”
Admittedly the warship is heading for
New Guinea now, but age alone pre-
vented my stepping through the recruit-
ing-office door straight into a real
Golden Age.

“Bo”; The two heavily-minked
dowagers coming from Sydney Tiv. were
discussing animatedly the Olivier show
they had just seen. “It’s all very provok-
ing,” said one, “and very cynical, but
I don’t like the title of it: ‘Skin of Our
Teeth’.” “That’s exactly what I think,”
agreed the other. “Why these playwrights
have to go to the gutter to pick up a
common slang expression for a name for
their plays is something I can’t undei-
stand. I think it’s disgusting! ” Good old
“gutter”! I suppose a Gallup Poll would
reveal that “Escaped with the skin of his
teeth,” “At their wits’ end,” “Lick the
dust,” “Teeth set on edge,” “Laughed to
scorn” and a hundred others are regarded
widely as everyday modern “slang” ex-
pressions, coined a few years ago by
some cove with a flair for expressing
things aptly and concisely. All have their
origin in the Old Testament.

“Cine Ma”: Victorian Chief Secretary
Dodgshun has absolved the churches
from having to register as theatres under
his Film Act, and a film of the 23rd
Psalm will not have to be preceded with
the notice “Passed by Censor,” which, as
the Rev. Hamilton Aiken, of the Religious
Film Society, says, would look rather
odd. It certainly would look odd, but I
can imagine a situation where the censors
would get even more embarrassed than
they must have been when they were sur-
yeying “Duel in the Sun,” described by
its sponsors as the most provocative film
ever presented to the public. The Old
Testament writers were forthright people,
and there are chapters in Holy Writ
which are intoned every week in the
churches without raising the least excite-
ment in their verbal form. What can be
described in verbal symbols, however,
should be equally capable of being de-
scribed in visual symbols, and it would be
interesting to see how Mr. Dodgshun
would react to, say, a visual presentation
of the story of Lot and his Daughters.

“Jasby”: What are kids made of these
days? One of the most repugnant
memories of my childhood is the recol-
lection of the occasional dose of castor-
oil —the horrors of anticipation; the
howls, entreaties and struggles in the
effort to avoid the inevitable ; the calling-
in of reinforcements to hold hands and
nose and to ensure that the mouth and
head were held at the proper angle ; the
final kick, the gurgling splutter and
the shuddering surrender* All this
passed through my mind the other
night when I was pressed into
service to administer castor-oil to my
eight-year-old. He opened his mouth
without protest as I approached with the
spoon and I felt rathe r like Hubert on
“And how DO you like my new skirt, Rupert?”
his way to put out the eyes of little Prince
Arthur. He took the spoon from me and
sipped the stuff. “Don’t take it like that,”
1 advised, “Get it down in one big gulp.
It’s better that way.” “No fear,” he re-
plied. “I want to make it last. I like it.”
And taking another sip he proceeded to
roll it on his tongue, like a connoisseur
savoring the taste of a vintage wine.

“Becks’’: That 1885 railway smash
resurrected by “Horseless Horseman” (B.
14/7 / ’4B) occurred at a time when there
was a strong agitation for the running of
a Sunday train to the Blue Mountains —
a suggestion that was being staunchly
opposed by the unco guid. A Bulletin
Plain English writer pointed out to advo-
cates of a trainless Sabbath that here was
sure proof that Providence was on their
side —the accident had occurred on a
Sunday—but that there had been a cer-
tain lack of discrimination in the choos-
ing of the victims.
Vengeance (for Sabbath-breaking) has
fallen on a few otherwise innocent railway
employees and a woman and child, and-
has spared those direct children of the
evil one, the betting men. This is not at
all as it should be, and unless explained
away will lead to scoffing by the thought-
less If the bookmakers had only been
picked up in bits, there would have been
complete unity and harmoniousness about
the accident, and the wretches would have
been properly turned into hell.
Instead of which the bookies, with the
exception of one with a broken leg and
another with a crushed rib, went on to
Rand wick to accept the tribute of the
Sydney punters.

“Dong”: One film scene which regis-
tered on my childhood “unconscious”
(B. 14/7/’4B) was set in a stadium dress-
ing-room where a crooked pug was having
his hands bandaged for the big bout. As
his opponent drank milk, was kind to his
grandmother, and therefore had right on
his side, the bad type’s trainers were
worried. Someone suggested horseshoes,
but they shook their heads ; then the chief
villain snapped his fingers and produced
from his bag of tricks a bottle of some
liquid which he painted on his fighter’s
bandages, declaring “This stuff is dyna-
mite.” In puzzling over it later in my
life 1 have come to the conclusion that
the liquid was some type of hardening
agent intended to merely shock the hero’s
jaw, but at the time I was greatly dis-
appointed that it didn’t blow his- head
off.

“Pitt St.”: Juggins is an apostle of
change. “One of the troubles with people
in a big city like Sydney,” he said, “is the
monotony of their lives. They come to
the same job every day on the same bus,
train, tram or ferry, see the same people,
go out and eat the same lunch and walk
along the same old streets past the same
old shops. No wonder they get in a
rut; no wonder you can’t stir them up.”
“Here, hold on,” I said. “You can’t call
life in Sydney, monotonous just now.
Just look at the gas business and firemen’s
strike and the coal shortage and all that.”
“Nothing new about it,” countered Jug-
gins. “If it isn’t one strike it’s another ;
if one thing isn’t short another is. Just
the same old monotony. What we need is
a violent change of some sort.” We left
it at that. Two days later Juggins
showed up full of wrath. “It’s the ruddy
boss,” he growled. “Old fool reckoned
I was gettin’ stale in the bolts department
and transferred me to the paints and var-
nishes. What the hell does he want to
go shoving me around for?”
* * * *
“Clooter”: I read where a chief in-
spector of London’s Scotland Yard,
having discovered that his 17-years-old
daughter was getting 20 notes a week as
a model in a fashionable hatshop, sur-
veyed his own £l4 a week and then went
along to the girl’s employer and said he
thought she was being overpaid for her
age. The employer agreed to chop it
down, and the flapper is reported as say-
ing that she saw her daddy’s point and
consoled herself with the remark that she
would earn “much more” when she is
older. One of the worst aspects of cur-
rent labor shortages and high wages in
this country is the big money being
handled every week by youngsters of
both sexes. Boys no sooner leave school
than they’re collecting four or five quid
a week, and the parent who tries to per-
suade his son to stay on at school on a
small allowance is up against it. I don’t
know what can be done, but it does seem
that some sort of compulsory savings
scheme is called for. Far too many of
our gilded youth spend their big wages
as though they expect the ‘“good times”
to last for ever.

“M.’s Boy”: A weird and wonderful
article is the post-war sock. The first
time it is worn it caresses a man’s foot
and clings affectionately to his lower leg.
After the first wash the thing promptly
ages inordinately and hangs upon the
line or the back of the dressing-table full
of wrinkles and whorls and sulking like
a pained poodle. It dries and is again
introduced to the foot. It has lost all
affinity for that extremity, The heel
slides under the sole, the upper flops
round the ankle like the limp cuffs of a
poverty-stricken clerk wearing a shirt too
large for him. At night, when the sock is
removed, peculiar patterns in strange
colors appear on the hitherto lilywhite
skin, and the peeled sock lies on the floor
like a wilted sponge, shapeless and life-
less. Giving it a look of utter distaste
this owner fishes for his slippers, won-
dering whether those girls who go sock-
less aren’t the better for it.

“Lyle”; Schoolboy nicknames are an
intriguing study. At a school football
game I heard a lad cheered by his school-
mates in the pavilion with “Good old
Tojo.” Now, however did a flaxen-haired
youngster get that nickname? Namgai
Dhoola, the sobriquet of another school
forward I used to watch, was under-
standable. He was ruggedly built and
red-haired like Kipling’s character of the
name. Another lad of my acquaintance
is known as Dagwood. There is a
resemblance between him and the comic-
strip character; but I’d dearly like to
know how a mate of his came to be
called Abdul. With light-brown hair and
as British a face as could be found, there
is nothing about him to suggest an Otto-
man Turk.

“Uncle Alfy”: Debt-collectors and
landladies (B. 9/6/’48)? Back in my
youth my wheezy typewriter was destined
for repossession, but they reckoned with-
out Mrs. Murphy. My ear at the keyhole
heard Mrs. M. open the door. “I’m a
debt-collector from Antique Typewriters.”
“Are ye indade? Then no' dit-collector
good nor bad puts his foot over my
clane doorstep. Isn’t it ashamed ye are,
a great hulking fellow like yerself, bother-
ing the likes of them that has a bit of
learnin’, and after collectin’ dits when
the rubbish-bin is overflowing in the back-
yard fer the want of collectin’?” The
slashing went on in broadest Kerry. The
hapless dit-collector apparently got the
gist of it; he ducked.

“Angus”: That flood reporter may not
have been so wide of the mark as
“T. McN.” (B. 23/6/’4B) imagines. Not
that I saw any hyacinth-loads of death-
adders, but snakes there were in abun-
dance, as one farmer found on returning
to his flooded-out home. He had to dis-
patch 42 “squatters” before he could take
possession. On one islanded farm, the
owner and his two sons bagged 122 Joe
Blakes, the majority of them blacks, but
with a fair sprinkling of copperheads and
browns. Snake stories came from all
points of the compass. There was the
lady enjoying a bath who looked up to
see a foot of a reptile swaying gracefully
through the window just above her head.
Her scream brought her husband, who
in turn brought the carving-knife, and
expertly slashed off the weaving head.
Probably the most enthusiastic dive into
the floodwaters was taken by the lady
who, having been ferried “down to the
bottom of the garden” by her husband,
looked up to see a large black snake
swimming in! Her scream, her leap and
her dive, over the snake, through the
open doorway, were, she declares, simul-
taneous!. “Women!” grumbled her boat-
man. “You never know how to take ’em.
Took me away from my work to row her
down, and then she decided to swim
back.”
* * * *
“Macnell”:
Old Vendetta has gone. Last of our “V’’-
class destroyers, she sank, with her sides opened,
to rest in the cemetery of warships off Sydney
Heads. Fast and heavily-gunned (for those
days), Vendetta was in almost as many
stoushes in the first war as in the second.
A few days after commissioning in October,
1917, she opened out to her 34 knots to get
in amongst a flotilla of German minesweepers
in the Kattegat. A month later she was in
action against German light cruisers in Heligo-
land Bight, and next year, in heavy Baltic
weather, bucked alongside mined Cassandra
and took off 430 of her crew. Before the year
was out she fought and drove ashore the
Bolshevik destroyer Spartak, and a few months
later captured another Red destroyer, Lennuk.
In 1920 she was privileged to escort the body
of the unknown warrior from Ostend to Dover
for burial in the Abbey—nearly 20 years later
she was to carry the body of Prime Minister
Lyons from Sydney to Tasmania for burial.
Peace brought the Navy’s usual duties —from
patrolling off Port Sudan during the Jiddah war
in 1924, when the Sirdar, Sir Lee Stack, was
murdered, to escorting the King and Queen in
March, 1925, on the Victoria and Albert’s cruise.
Vendetta’s wardroom received autographed por-
traits in recognition. When the second war
came the ship was 23 years old, but, scorning
Haw Haw’s references to “wire and string,”
she flung herself into the bombs and shells of
Malta convoys and Wavell’s “spud run.” In
seven weeks she carried 4000 men and 650
tons of supplies and ammunition to Tobruk.
In March, 1940, she beat the life out of an
Italian sub. with depth-charges, and shortly
after was at sea with the British Fleet when
the Italian Battle Fleet was sighted. All ships
turned to engage, but an engine defect held
Vendetta back from what developed into the
Battle of Matapan. After bombarding Bardia,
evacuating 350 men from Greece, being almost
constantly at sea and steaming 100,000 miles
in the Med., the old ship was withdrawn to
Singapore for badly-needed refit, and arrived
just before the Jap bombers. She was m
dock, guns on the pier, but, bolted down, they
opened fire and collected a bomber. In January,
1942, she was ordered to prepare for towing
from Singapore. On the trip south she and
towing destroyer Stronghold fought off heavy
air attacks, one while a broken tow was being
repassed. Meeting sloop Yarra, Vendetta took
her mail inboard on a line —it was the last
Yarra sent. With heavy seas in the Bight,
tow parted again, and the captain of the fo c sle
had his leg broken by a flying capstan bar
as cable flew out of the bullring. Adrift for
72 hours, rolling scuppers-under, she was
blown 102 miles before, by superb seamanship,
tow was passed and both ships, rusted and
salt-caked, made Williamstown. Though re-
fitted, she couldn’t compete with modern 4.7 in.
boats for Fleet duties, and from January, 1943,
to mid-1944 she carried troops and stores in
New Guinea waters, loosing a handy bombard-
ment now and then. At the end she was m
Rabaul with carrier Glory for the Jap sur-
render. Returning to Sydney, worn out, the
gallant old craft was paid-off into reserve m
November, 1945, and sold the next year lor
scrap.
TELL THEM!
“Mr. Chifley, after his tour of Berlin, said that the
strong stand of ’the Western Powers against Russia’s
attempt to blockade the city was the only one
that could be taken. « That was what he would tell
Australia.’'
You found a situation past endurance
And mean to tell us so? Well, Ben, it’s true
Not many are in need of such assurance
But clearly some misguided persons do.
These self-styled “Friends of Russia,” whose
aggressions,
They seem to think, are nothing to condemn,
May get some good from your first-hand im-
pressions.
Tell them I
Those who proclaim in terms enthusiastic
Their firm conviction, their profound belief
No land has ever found such swift and drastic
Short-cuts to progress in a term so brief,
Those who profess to see in her an ample
Reason, a well-established theorem
Of methods we should take for an example,
Tell them I
Tell them about the rulers of a nation
Accepted by themselves as trusty friends
Who’re not above resorting to starvation
Of hapless millions to attain their ends,
Who hold good faith an unsubstantial vapor
And honor an exploded apophthegm
And treaties negligible scraps of paper.
Tell them 1
Inform the noisy few who like being labelled
The “Friends of Russia” all she’s done to beat
Poor Europe, sorely stricken and disabled,
From getting back again upon her feet;
What brutal force she’s used across her border
And, further off, what evil stratagem
To block agreement and foment disorder.
Tell them I
Tell those who never weary of exuding
Benevolence and on platforms love to pose
As full of charity for all —including
Apparently their country’s deadliest foes —
Your frank opinion of Berlin’s position
And why stern measures must be used to stem
The crooked Kremlin’s damnable ambition.
But don’t tell us who need no such monition,
Tell them I

T. THE R.


“Zake”; A little unexpected drama
was witnessed by the herds of free-feeding
politicians who were carried from Sydney
last week in the Deadhead Express
Awaba-bound to watch that stout fighter
McGirr (“I’ll have any housewife fined
five hundred pounds if she dares use any
gas!”) fire the first shot at a “mine”
(blueprinted only) and turn the first sod
at a power-station (ditto), both to be built
and operated at some future dream-time,
Commos permitting. A Mrs. Israel and
her daughter went verbally for Baddeley,
McGirr’s offsider, after James had given
a very amateurish imitation of a man
wielding a silver spade. The ladies,
it seemed, owned the land on which
the power-station will supposedly rise,
and they angrily alleged that Jim,
Jack and Co, were about to shove up their
power-station without so much as a “by
your leave.” The Badly cowered before
the hosts of Israel, in keeping with the
non-fighting tradition of the N.S.W.
“Labor” Cabinet. But it appears that
McGirr, Baddeley and Co., who got lost
driving up and arrived after the train
passengers, “may have turned the wrong
sod” (“S. M. Herald”). On the morn-
ing after, Baddeley explained: “The site
for the ceremony was selected because it
was accessible. I don’t know whether the
power-station will be built on Mrs. Israel’s
property or not. All I know is that a
power-station is to be built at Lake Mac-
quarie.” And all he knows is all he
cares.

“Glen Rowan”: He hasn’t been seen
lately, that old fellow who was alleged
to be Dan Kelly, and maybe that’s as it
should be, 68 years having passed since
the gang was wiped out. Two years' after
Gienrowan the American outlaw Jesse
James was shot by a couple of his own
henchmen, and it seems that just as there
were many Australians who believed Dan
Kelly escaped the police bullets, so there
are Americans who reckon James’s death
was “faked” or something. Anyway, a
101-year-old has turned up in San
Leandro (Cal.) and been “positively
identified” by A 1 Jennings, ex-train rob-
ber, now 85. The two recognised each
“ Careful, there, or you'll ruin the color scheme!”
other, and both remembered an episode
of their youth wherein Jennings beat
James to the draw. What I’m waiting
for is the inevitable old bloke who will
rise up and declare that both are im-
postors, asserting that he is the real Jesse
L and that he and Jennings shot each
other to death in the brasada below
Eagle Pass rather than be taken by the
Royal North-west Mounted, then hot on
their trail.
“Melbn”: Probably the only living link
with Victoria’s founders still in service
is the old Edina. Launched on the Clyde
in 1854, she was taken over by the Ad-
miralty to carry stores and ammunition
to the Crimea. Later she was heard of
running the blockade for the South in
the American civil war. In 1863, Stephen
Henty, who founded Portland, bought
her, and subsequently she was used to
carry gold-diggers to New Zealand, after
which she settled down to half a century
or more of service on Port Phillip Bay.
In 1938 her present owners, the Victorian
Lighterage Pty., bought her, still as
staunch as ever, intending to convert her
to lighterage duties, but the Navy took
her over and she suffered the ignominy
of being a floating storehouse. It says a
lot for the quality of the stuff turned
out by British workshops 94 years ago
that she is shortly to be taken out of
Rotten Row and used as a cargo lighter.

“Wusslean”: Newspaper reminiscences
on the occasion of the Royal silver-wed-
ding celebrations were notable for the
absence of anything in the shape of
youthful escapades of the King. From
this point of view George VI may present
a problem to his future biographers; his
eariy life, unlike some of his pre-
decessors’ efforts, appears to have been
exemplary. Leigh Hunt once referred
to an hotel in Barbados the pro-
prietress of which used to boast that she
had successfully presented a bill of
damages to the amount of £7OO to His
Royal Highness Prince William, after-
wards Duke of Clarence and King
William IV, who “in a fit of ultrajoviality,
with the mess of the 49th Regiment, de-
molished all the furniture in her house, to
the very beds.” The hostess had refused
to interfere with the high spirits of the
King’s son, prudently concluding that he
would pay up like a gentleman.

“Balander”: The rather virulent form
of influenza afflicting eastern Australia
has caused several deaths in Brisbane
this month, one doctor claiming that it
was the most serious epidemic the city
has had since 1926, Another diagnosed it
as pneumonic influenza, which was the
name given to the dreadful epidemic of
1919-20, when millions died throughout
the world. It’s my belief we’ve been
saved from something like a repetition
of those days by the advent of the sulpha,
drugs, which shows that medical science
is by no means sitting back in the breech-
ing.

“W.P.T.”: Chimney - sweeps (B.
7/7/’48)? On the side of a two-storied
house in a short thoroughfare off Oxford-
street, Paddington (Sydney), can be seen
the Vice-Regal coat-of-arms. This is'
the home of the Provost family, who
were chimney-sweeps, seyeral generations
of them attending the chimneys of Gov-
ernment House and other Government
buildings. The coat-of-arms stands out
in bold relief, and is really a work of
art. Today only about half a dozen
chimney-sweeps operate in the whole of
Sydney.

“Jemac”: Old hands of cruisers Aus-
tralia and Sydney will remember the
Mediterranean First Cruiser Squadron,
Mountbatten’s new command they
served in it in 1935-36, and were detached
from it on their pilgrimage to Gallipoli.
When Italy made her demands on Abys-
sinia in 1935 Australia was in Malta. She
fuelled and ammunitioned to full capacity
in a day and raced at 28 knots to join the
squadron in Alexandria, the six eight-
inchers weighing almost immediately and
steaming to sea for exercises. Australia,
being junior ship, was detailed as
launcher and controller of the new radio-
controlled target-plane Queen Bee. A
Tiger Moth, the little plane flew down
the squadron line, each ship blasting
away with single four-inchers as it passed.
Completely untouched. Queen Bee sailed
serenely on over the horizon out of sight,
and was recovered resting gently on the
mouth of the Nile. Australia’s a.-a.
gunnery in the Philippines was something
of an improvement on that effort; The
squadron now comprises four modern
cruisers, Newcastle, Euryalus, Phoebe
and Liverpool, the ship which lost its
foc’s’le off Crete and was towed back to
Alexandria (B. 5/5/’4B).
“There's plenty more in the kitchen, Mrs. Hunter-Tweedle, if you'd like
a second helping.”
“C. Pipe”: I was sitting before the
fire, half-asleep, hearing the A.B.C. an-
nouncer’s voice as a sort of soporific
drone. Wife and younger child were
abed, the elder child beside me. Sud-
denly a disgusted voice said “You bloody
fool.” My eyes shot open to meet those
of the horror-stricken young one oppo-
site. “What do you mean?” I growled.
“Forgot yourself, eh? Go on, get off to
bed,” “But” “But nothing!” I
roared. “I’ll have no bad language in
this house.” A second later I was alone.
Next. morning I had to apologise, the
papers being full of the strange voice
which had burst in on the A.B.C. broad-
cast with the Shavian adjective. It wasn’t
made any easier by the missus’s tart
comment that I “never do listen to any-
one else’s side.”
* * * *
“Flathead”: Distressed by an epidemic
of large holes in his telegraph poles,
Britain’s P.M.G. went after the culprits
and found them to be woodpeckers, in
particular the green and greater-spotted
varieties. I wonder if these saboteurs
could be the same about which passing
trainloads of troops used to warn each
other with the advice to “pull your heads
in or the woodpeckers’ll get you”? Such
choice pickings are scarce in peace-time,
and, knowing that there is nothing that
can squash a civilian’s morale quicker
than a falling telegraph pole, the green
and greater-spotted peckers are probably
going through a form of rehabilitation.
The P.M.G. has a different theory; he
holds the view that the birds have sud-
denly been attracted by the humming
wires, and he has instructed his engineers
to silence the hum by binding lead strips
near the insulators. The public is asked
to “report all cases of attack to the
P.M.G. so that the value of treatment may
be assessed.”
* * * *
“Plop”: Magnificent as some of his
neckties have been, my neighbor’s latest,
in royal-blue velvet with crimson spots,
was blinding even through the tissue-
paper in its box. He told me that al-
though it would make a fine collector’s
piece he could never wear it, and then
he broke into a saddening story. He
suffers from an allergy which makes his
hair bristle whenever he meets such stuff
as this tie is made of. He can never don
suede shoes to set off his cravats in a
fitting manner, nor can he enjoy the
pleasure of biting deep through a peach-
skin —he can barely manage to peel one
with a long-handled knife, holding the
fruit in a napkin. More than once he has
been forced to leave a theatre because the
pile on the upholstery had the same effect
on him as a knife screeching on a sauce-
pan has to other folk. “And now,” he
concluded, “I’ve been given this, on my
birthday, by my own son. I’ll have to
give it back to him —he likes them bright,
too, and doesn’t suffer from this velvet
business. Wait a minute! Do you
suppose the young devil had that in
mind?”

“F.S.”: Two unexpected benefactions
outside the Felton Bequest have come
the way of Melbourne National Gallery.
One comprises four valuable Constable
landscapes “Denham Church,”
“Summer House,” “Summer Sunset” and
“Dawn” —a sea-piece by Cotman of the
Norwich school, “Watering Place,” by
Gainsborough, and “Calm,” by Van der
Velde. They have been presented by
Gwendoline Violet Davis in memory of
her brother, Ernest de Grayes, a British
artist. The other gift—a Constable and a
Wilson—comes from the famous Nettle-
fold collection, which is being distributed
throughout the Empire. The Acting Lud
Mayor -will come in for several from the
same source; his relatives established the
collection.

“Jemac”: R.A.N. Nursing Service, last
of the service’s women auxiliaries, has
been disbanded. Comprising at full
strength 56 nurses, plus three physiothera-
pists and a bacteriologist, the R.A.N.N.S.
did a first-rate job in shore hospitals as
far north as Milne Bay, allowing trained
male staff to ship on seagoing vessels.
Sick-berth attendants afloat today will
remember benefits of early training at
Flinders —a ward petty-officer assumed
you’d swept under all beds; a ward sister
looked.
* * * *
“Spare Corp.”: A news item about an
old gentleman in South Australia who
died happy at the age of 82 because, after
a lifetime of devotion to cribbage, he
recently got the “possible” 29 points in
a hand, leaves me unmoved. Crib has
been only an occasional game with me,
but I have three times held a jack and
three fives with the fourth five turned up
in the jack’s suit. One occasion was on
the troopship Karoa coming back from
World War I; on that trip I also, play-
ing bridge, was dealt 13 hearts, and at
solo picked up a lay-down misere, with
the four lowest cards of three suits and
the two of the fourth. Probably just as
remarkable was the draw of five sixes in
a game of dominoes, and, going for an
additional draw, the other two sixes at
once —which meant, of course, the full
pack for my opponent. But don’t say I
was lucky—vaccination after Colombo
gave me an upper arm like a leg of
mutton.

“Kendon”: A man who must be think-
ing harsh things about the law has just
been refused a divorce because for two
years he has been paying a separation
allowance at the rate of £A2 per week
instead of £2 sterling. The award was
made in a British court, and, although the
wife had made no complaint, and the
husband had acted in good faith, his
Honor ruled that the order implied Eng-
lish currency. It will cost the man the dif-
ference —about five bob in the pound—to
make himself eligible for a decree. Igno-
rance of divorce laws is less common
now than it was a decade or two ago. I
recall one case where a divorced hus-
band, sued for arrears of maintenance,
pleaded that, as he had remarried, he
was unable to meet his obligations. His
ex-wife admitted that she, also, had re-
married. Their amazement when told
that alimony should have ceased on her
remarriage was tempered, at least on the
man’s part, by the thought of years of
unnecessary payments.
* * * *
“Atlanta”: Retirement of a northern
police inspector led him recently to relate
one of the less glorious episodes of his
career when, as a young and zealous
sergeant in an outback town, he investi-
gated the murder of a traveller whose
skull had been cleft with an axe and his
wagonette stolen. Close to the scene of
the crime was the camp of Billy Sing,
Chinese ringbarker, to which the sergeant
rode. The place seemed deserted, but the
law took full precautions: dismounted,
tied his horse some distance back in
the bush, and advanced with revolver
drawn. As he neared the tent a scream-
ing apparition broke forth, pigtail flying,
and headed for the bush, but an erratic
volley from the sergeant’s .38 caused it
to reverse its decision, and Billy Sing,
handcuffed, was marched back to town.
There news awaited the sergeant. Forty
miles north and still driving the stolen
wagonette, the real murderer had been
apprehended.
“WALKING” THE WATERS.
“Joe Simms, a dockworker, ‘walked’ across the
Thames at Chelsea, his arms folded across his chest
and his hands on his shoulders, the novel feat being
acclaimed by cheering thousands.” — Cable.
He “walked” the Thames, put up the same
display
As might a swan across the surface skimming.
“Walked it?” Why, that’s impossible, you say.
Well, term it what you like, but anyway
It can’t be classed as swimming.
He “walked” the waters, calm, assured, serene.
But in his feat ’twere foolish to endeavor
To find some likeness to the Bible scene
St. Matthew writes about in chap, xiv,
For there was none whatever.
He “walked” the river with his frame upright
As far as it was possible to show it,
But with the upper part alone in sight
Topping the tide, it’s clear his feet were quite
The length of him below it.
He “walked” ,the stream, not “qp.” so much
as “through,”
To give aquatic souls a mild convulsion.
And cheering crowds acclaimed it as the due
Of the inventor of a wholly new
Mode of marine propulsion.
Old Father Thames, what memories of the past
You conjure up! What- means to curb and
boss you
Men have devised, what bonds to hold you
fast
Since London Bridge above your course was
cast!
What changes have you seen! And now at last
A chap has “walked” across you.

With headquarters at Suva, this co. does
a large merchandising business through-
out Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, and is a
large plantation (copra) owner as well.
The £739,613 of capital—2l9,2o6 6 p.c.
cum. prefs. and 520,407 ords.—is en-
trenched behind £805,803 of visible re-
serves; so the two combined need turn
in only 4.2 p.c. to cover pref. require-
ments and 10 p.c. to the ords. Last
term’s profit was 7.6 p.c. on shareholders’
funds, giving current dividend rates a
comfortable appearance.
Ever since the sharp, short slump after
World War I, when a loss of £90,074
Showed up, the board has followed a
conservative policy, keeping divs.
moderate and strengthening the prop for
capital, visibly and otherwise. The ords.
averaged 5.7 p.c. for the 16 years to close
of accounts in 1939, followed by three
lots of 6 p.c., two of 8i p.c. and then
10 p.c. for the last four years, sweetened
with a 5 p.c. victory bonus in 1946.
Also, since 1942, £288,000 of inner re-,
serves and £84,026 of capital profits on
sale of securities have been disclosed.
And, put into the crucible, the “Wild
Cat” believes assets would still assay a
lot more than book-value.
Since V.-P. Day trade—governed largely
by conditions in the sugar, copra, mining,
banana and dairying industries—has
hummed like a hive of bees in summer-
time, thanks to ready markets at fat
prices for practically all island produce.
Last term a record sugar crop (140,000
tons raws) was sold at a bumper figure,
gold production (14,000 ounces) in-
creased, and the price of copra in Suva
shot up from £29 10s. to £46 a ton, f.m.s.
grade—in 1939 the stuff fetched as little
as £8 12s. 6d. a ton. The British Ministry
of Food now buys and ships all copra
produced in the area where the co.
operates, the co. acting as agent, appar-
ently on a very satisfactory basis.
The year’s improvement in gross earn-
ings from trading (after providing for

The scrip of this welf-entrencbed Rock-
hampton merchandising business falls into
the category of sound trading equities.
The co t has strong connections in the
centre and central-west of Queensland,
there are branches at Brisbane and Syd-
ney, and the cautious management has
long followed a policy of underpinning
the structure against the effects of drought
and other misfortunes. Paid capital ad-
vanced from £93,750 early this century to
£250,000 in 1918 with the aid of only
£11,250 of cash subscriptions. In 1945
4s. a share (£50,000) was returned, re-
ducing the figure to £200,000 in 250,000
shares of 16s. each. And over the last
43 years shareholders have never failed
to receive a div,, the average being a
little over 10 p.c.
Last term trade was interrupted by the
hold-up in rail transport, and drought
and stock losses in the central-west hit
the co.’s clients there. Conditions else-
where were favorable, and so were in-
comes and employment generally. So
bigger turnover, due partly to price rises,
sent gross earnings up £5165:

allowing for depreciation (shown as
written-off in the introductory table), the
net result (£34,019) was £938 stronger at
17 p.c. on capital as against 16.5, 15.6,
13.8 and 14.1 p.c back to 1944. On
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves
combined) the year’s net earnings were
only 5.9 p.c. The div. was kept at 141
p.c., and there is nothing in sight at the
moment to suggest that it is likely to be
interfered with during the current term.

A year or so ago the board said “it is
gratifying.... to be able to restore the
dividend to the pre-war level of 12£ p.c.”
Now, having taken a second look at the
way events are shaping, the directors
have decided to adopt a more conservative
dividend policy. They put it this way;
The destructive effect of trying to get the
last ounce of usefulness out of such assets
must be allowed for in our accounts.
Accordingly, in addition to the amount
allowed for depreciation by the Taxation
Department, we have doubled our appro-
priation of profits to plant-renewal account
for the above reasons and the further reason
that the cost of replacement of these items
has risen substantially. The higher cost
of maintenance is not entirely reflected in
our accounts, because of the impossibility
of carrying out all that is necessary. While
your directors regret the reduction in the
rate of dividend, they feel that it is neces-
sary to stress the importance and prudence
of ensuring that the co. has sufficient funds
set aside to keep the wheels turning.
Production and sales were a record,
and plant was taxed to capacity, which
is about 70 p.c. above pre-war. If pre-
sent production efficiency is to be main-
tained, further increase in output means
“installing additional plant from start to
finish,” not merely adding a boiler or a
vat. Australian beer consumption per
head of population rose from 10.34 gal-
lons in 1936-37 to 13.45 gallons in
1945-46, then shot up to 15.94 gallons
for 1946-47, and promises to be higher
still for 1947-48. He would be a bold
man, however, who would predict that
the public’s pockets will be always as
well lined as they are today.
Despite higher production costs,
gross earnings from brewing, etc.,
stepped up £5803, and rents, etc., from
the co.’s 92 hotels turned in an extra
£6514, making a total gross gain of
£12,317;

But management, distribution and other
charges (up £15,388) won the race, not-
withstanding abolition of War-time (Co.)
Tax. Including an unexplained addition
to reserves of £BOOO in 1947, the slip in
last term’s net result was £11,071. Still,
the £43,336 covered the pref. div. and
14.3 p.c. on ord. capital as against 18.7,
12.3 and 10 p.c. for the three preceding
years. Of the £10,836 left after paying
divs., £lO,OOO was tossed into plant-re-
newals reserve, etc. (£114,500).
During the year £34,000 was clipped
off mortgages and £16,780 off the over-
draft, cash (down £27,615) and debtors’
balances (down £12,512) being reduced
for the purpose;

The more-or-less liquid surplus (£81,012)
was £12,183 stronger. There was little
change in the book value of brewery,
hotels, etc., reckoned to be worth over
£170,000 more than the figure at which
they appeared a couple of years ago.
The price of the f,-p. pound ords. fell
sharply from 595. in April to 555. (seller)

Paringa Mining and Exploration
This London-controlled co. (paid capi-
tal £270,440 in Is. stock units) holds two
main groups of leases—Paringa, 160
acres, and Maritana, 300 acres —on the
Kalgoorlie Golden Mile (W.A.). Only
the Paringa mine (24 acres), served by
two shafts, North (680 ft.) and South
(1300 ft.), is in full-scale production. Other
mines and areas on the leases are being
either developed or tested.
Here are treatment figures and financial

t Less U.K. income tax, now 9s. in the £.
About 80 p.c. of last year’s bigger ton-
nage came from stopes in the Paringa
and the balance from development of the
near-by Croesus South and Block 45
mines. The profit, written after charging
£16,079 (up £2151) to development, £6945
(up £776) depreciation and £9682 (down
£1445) taxation, was 6.29 p.c. on capital.
However, finances are comfortable
and the outlook encouraging, so the
board repeated the nominal 12} p.c. div.,
which English income tax of 9s. in the £
makes worth only 6} p.c. in shareholders’
hands.
Despite wage and price lifts 1 , costs were
got back lOd, a ton, thanks to larger

Wages and prices for stores, power, etc.,
have continued to rise since the close of
accounts. Worse still, a reduction in
working hours to 40 surface and 37}
underground per five-day week threatens
to reduce ore extraction, unless more
suitable labor can be obtained, which
would further bump up the wages bill.
Under existing conditions it is by no
means certain that profit for the current
term will cover a nominal 12} p.c. div.
The continued rise in costs and reduc-
tion of hours have already brought post-
ponement of the proposed mill extension
—a 50,000-ton-p.a. unit was to be added
to handle marginal-grade oxidised ore
from the upper levels.
At end August last ore reserves—
-195,646 tons averaging 5.24dwt. —were
about two years ahead of present mill
capacity. However, provided the margin
between costs and values doesn’t shrink
too much, the outlook is encouraging.
In the Paringa mine a new ore channel,
showing payable values, is being opened
up on the eastern boundary between
640 ft. and 800 ft., and a new drive at
976 ft. in South shaft is on the way to tap
a borehole find (9.77dwt.) on the western
boundary. The drill has also disclosed a

Canberra Finance
The demands of the bloated
Canberra Administration grow
greater with each passing year.
The demands on the people are
taken in the shape of money,
manpower and materials. The
result is heavy taxation, inflat-
ing Government payrolls, labor
and material shortages and a re-
ducing standard of living that is
accompanied by a depreciation
in the buying-power of wage and
other earnings and of savings.
The colossal taxation levies of
today could be taken only by
an Administration with an
equally colossal hide. Canberra
“Labor’s” post-war “planning”
has brought failure on the pro-
duction side, and yet it continues
to divert into the stagnant waters
of Socialism an increasing
amount of manpower and tax-
payers’ money, robbing the
stream of industrial enterprise
of<*its volume and strength.
One reason advanced by Mr.
Chifley for continued heavy
taxation has been that it is a
preventative of inflation. But
inflation continues in spite of
taxes and “controls,” and the
Chifley attitude towards produc-
tion has been largely respon-
sible. Private enterprise has not
been given the encouragement it
deserves, and Canberra “Labor”
has done nothing to enforce in-
dustrial discipline, so necessary
in order to increase production.
Industrial anarchy on the coal-
fields and elsewhere has been a
result of the Chifley policy, and
man-hour production has fallen
far and wide.
The Federal civil service now
exceeds 166,000 persons, against
60.000 before the war. Total
“employment” has risen by over
600.000 in nine years, but con-
sumer-demand has increased at
a greater rate than output of
goods' and services. Heavy taxes,
despite inflating wages, have
dulled incentives.
The enormous exactions by
the Canberra Government upon
the people are revealed in this
tabular comparison:

£71.4 million “social-services

cludes some entertainments tax)

ernments, compared with £41.6

The “Defence and post-war
charges (1939-45)” require some
explanation. Actual “defence
and service departments,” with
a few etceteras, cost £75 million
last year, compared with £129.5
million in the preceding period.
But, although there was no £25
million gift to Britain in the
1947-48 accounts, the “post-war
charges” totted up to £144.2 mil-
lion, against £161.1 million in
1946-47, when there was such a
gift. Included in the figures are
“subsidies” —£45.8 million last
year, £30.4 million the year be-
fore. Interest on the 1939-45
war debt cost us £48.2 million
last year, compared with £46
million the period before.
After deducting “miscel-
laneous credits” of £39.1 million,
partly representing revenue from
disposals (against £5B million in
1946-47), net “defence” outgo
was £52.6 million lower at £lBO
million. Though this expendi-
ture remains grossly inflated, the
huge revenue extracted from the
pockets of the community en-
abled it and all other outgo to
be met without borrowing (ex-
cept for advances to the States),
whereas £37.9 million was
borrowed for “defence” in the
preceding Budget period.
There was a tremendous leap
in administrative expenditure.
Outgo of the inflated depart-
ments —the intake of new “em-
ployees” during the year con-
tinued at a great rate—rose by
£11.3 million, reaching £26.8
million. Gross abuse of the pub-
lic purse and of a half-baked
“full-employment” policy are
visible all through the 1947-48
Federal accounts. Waste and ex-
travagance are evident on a
staggering scale, and the inflated
national income reported for the
year is an illusion. Mr. Chifley
ended the year with a surplus of
£1.5 million. He could have
hardly presented a greater insult
to an overtaxed and overcon-
trolled people.
Maoriland “Social Security”
Social security cost New
Zealand the staggering total of
£40,443,000 in the year ended
March, against £36,825,000 in
1946-47, Compare this with
Maoriland’s cost of £25,890,568
for all services (omitting unem-
ployment-relief) in 1935-36, the
year Labor leaped into the
saddle. Then the bill for all
social services was a mere
£7,750,000. For the same today
M.L. is paying nearly £6O million
yearly, and the figure is still
soaring. It’s a terrific load on
the backs of taxpayers.
When M.L. State planners
started their super-pension-hos-
pital-medical-drug scheme nine
years ago, chemists estimated
the cost of free medicine at
£300,000. Today the State has
to cough up more than a million
a year for this item. Govern-
ment heads reckoned the whole
outlay when social security was
in full swing would be £l6 mil-
lion a year. When Prof. A. H.
Tocker, leading economist, set
that figure alongside the £4O mil-
lion lately he said: “If ever a
scheme was unplanned it was
social security,” No one has
yet warned that if expansion
goes on something will burst, but
that’s what plenty of Maori-
landers think. Last year, instead
of tightening the rein, Fraser,
Nash and Co. dipped into con-
solidated revenue for £l6 million
to add to £2B million collected
in direct social-security taxes.
Labor won’t admit 40 mil-
lions is too much to spend on
social security for a million and
three-quarters of population (not
“And if you Want it more powerful there's a special
booster-switch .”
much more than Sydney’s); but
it is not only excessive and ex-
travagant—it’s bad for Maori-'
landers. It is possible for a
hypochondriac to get half a
dozen bottles of medicine and
drink the lot, or pour it down
the sink—and a good deal is
going both ways. Another big
leakage is that a doctor can
make half a dozen calls when
one would be enough, and be
paid half a dozen fees.
Any businessman who allowed
a fraction of the waste and in-
efficiency in this scheme to creep
into his business would go to
the wall. Prof. Tocker estimates
that at least three-quarters of the
people are paying much more in
than they’re getting out, so they’d
be better off if the scheme were
scrapped. The other quarter
could be well cared for by spend-
ing £lO million.
Sweden’s method might get
M.L. out of its fix. The main
difference is that Swedish
patients pay a small part of the
medico’s fee and foot a quarter
or a third of the cost of medi-
cine. Swedish doctors aren’t run
off their feet to attend trivial
cases and accumulate fees, the
quantity of medicine used is
small, there’s no sign of waste,
and the scheme supports itself,
How else can M.L. be saved
from its growing army of dis-
honest, selfish, dope-drinking
sick or half-sick, and quacks
who drag their calling down
to swell incomes? Businessmen,
worried about the trend, are
asking for a “competent and
non-political investigation” into
social security, with the spot-
light focused on costs and re-
suits, and they want the scheme
to carry itself without leaning
on general revenue. But Finance
Minister Nash, jubilant about the
balance of £7f million in the
fund with which to start the
1948-49 year, can’t see danger.
The 40-hour week, after “a
fair trial,” has, according to
Latham Withall, director of the
Associated Chambers of Manu-
factures, reduced production by
from 8 p.c. to 12 p.c. (accord-
ing to the type of industry), in-
creased commodity prices by
from 4 p.c. to 6 p.c. (transport
costs higher) and labor costs by
11 p.c. Since Mr. Withall spoke
the Commonwealth basic wage
has been lifted 4s, a week (to
£6) in Sydney, with an average
rise of 2s, a week (to £5 165.)
in all the capital cities.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
The Docks
The report of the Working
Party on the turn-round of
shipping in British ports, pub-
lished on June 8, was a shrewd
and commonsense document, of
practical value to the nation in
its fight for recovery. That its
publication should have been
overshadowed and its usefulness
defeated by an inexcusable and
wanton strike in the London
docks is yet another highly
serious instance of the frustra-
tion with which the country is'
overtried. It is rather as if a
man had shored-up his house as
temporary protection against a
blizzard only to have it crushed
by an avalanche.
In order to increase the dollar-
earning capacity of ports the
Working Party advocated wider
mechanisation and more effec-
tive use of available labor. It
found that there was substance
in complaints of restrictive prac-
tices on both Sides of the in-
dustry, and urged that full use
be made of existing machinery
to. solve the problem. Above all,
it stressed that importers, ex-
porters and shipowners should
give first thought to the saving
of time in the turn-round of
shipping.
The Minister of Transport, in
introducing the report, said that
British shipping amounted to
15.700.000 gross tons only
1.200.000 tons less than at the
beginning of the war —but that
it was necessary to charter in
dry cargo alone something like
2.000. tons deadweight. A
saving of one day on turn-round
would reduce the foreign ton-
nage required by 100,000 dead-
weight tons.
In the light of after-events the
report makes sad reading.
Within a week of the publica-
tion of the report 20,000 workers'
out of 26,000 came out on
strike; and, although there was
some early resumption, upwards
of 19,000 stayed out for a fort-
night. It is estimated that
2.000. working hours were
lost, that the strikers forfeited
£300,000 in wages and that
£17,500,000-worth of exports
was held up.
The Strike
What of the strike itself, which
may well have been as serious
an attempt to browbeat the
nation into submission as any
since the general strike of
1926? A gang of 11 men
(whose weekly earnings are
stated to average more than
£10) three times demanded a
Special rate of ss. a ton instead
of 3s. 4d, for handling a “dirty”
cargo of 100 tons of zinc oxide.
Three times a viewing commit-
tee, which included representa-
tives of the men, endorsed the
lower rate. On the fourth time
of appeal the gang was sus-
pended, and a special board,
whose chairman had been ap-
proved by both sides, confirmed
the suspension but shortened its
period. Then came the strike.
The feature that stands out
prominently from these simple
facts is the patience with which
the men’s complaint was investi-
gated. There was no harsh or
summary treatment. The “exist-
ing machinery” referred to by
the Working Party was applied
in a reasonable and democratic
way, even to the extent of an
independent and impartial
board.
Much has been said of late
by Government leaders about
democracy in industry. Only
the day before the strike Mr.
Morrison, speaking at Cardiff,
said; “Our minds must be
turned and our organisations
adapted to see that we can build
up democracy and get results in
industry.” At the dockyard
gates it was anarchy, not de-
mocracy, The need for adapta-
tion is in the rank-and-file of
the workers and, more particu-
larly, in their own leaders.
The trade-union chiefly con-
cerned is the largest of them all,
the Transport and General
Workers’ Union, with 1,200,000
members —about a sixth of the
total T.U.C. membership. Over
a number of years an organisa-
tion has been built up substan-
tially to the advantage of the
workmen themselves. The old
grounds for discontent in-
security, the hazards of casual
employment and lack of protec-
tion have been removed.
Nationalisation measures, so
long sought as a cure for all ills,
are on the way. Because the
union is big—much too big—the
hard-won benefits are obscured
by the petty and vexatious trivi-
alities which follow overcentra-
lisation and the niggling ways of
bureaucracy.
It is known that there has
been much discontent within the
union: this strike was essentially
a revolt against the authority of
its high-ups. The great body of
workers, who can never get very
far away from the anti-boss
complex, now view their own
elected but remote leaders in the
same vaguely tyrannical light as
once they viewed the “despotic”
master of old. Between the
rank-and-file and their leaders
is a rift as wide as that between
doctrinary Capital and Labor.
The Consequences
Because of his long personal
connections with Dockland, the
pleading of the Prime Minister
in his radio speech may have in-
fluenced the strikers more than
did the proclamation of the state
of emergency. The British pub-
lic, nevertheless, finds it hard to
understand why it was so long
delayed.
In its continuance the conduct
of the strike represents a good
example of a Communist recon-
naissance-in-force, even to the
face-saving words of the “non-
party”-dominated strike com-
mittee ; “In view of the complete
line-up of the reactionary forces
against us,” etc., etc. It would
be wrong to overrate its suc-
cess, particularly as the great
energy employed in trying to
provoke sympathetic strikes in
other ports brought only a half-
hearted response. And it is sig-
nificant that the strikers them-
selves’ became vocally impatient
of political issues. Four-fifths of
the dockyard-workers turned to
their shop-stewards and sup-
ported the strike committee only
because they were nearer to
them than the union bosses.
To what degree subversive
elements sought to exploit the
situation for non-pertinent rea-
sons can only be left to surmise.
With the relentless cancer of
Soviet policy striving to take
root and then to strangulate, it
is not to be expected that the
enemies within will pass un-
noticed.
The problem that remains—
and it is a very considerable one
—is how this union, which has
grown mighty, unwieldy and
impersonal, will be able to re-
gain the respect and confidence
of the greater part of its mem-
bers.

Under present conditions the availability of
modern household equipment is the main
consideration in the buyer’s mind. We are
glad to buy without asking searching questions about what is underneath
the porcelain enamel. But with increasing production and a wider
range of buying choice, purchasers will rightly and wisely become
more inquisitive. “What steel is underneath?” will be a wise leading
question. The seller who can answer “COMROL Sheet Steel” will clinch
his sale . . . and the buyer will have a gilt-edged

SUNDRY SHOWS
Watercolors.
Arctic Sydney weather, the
dark Educational Department
Galleries and the usual large
number of exhibits are inci-
dental disadvantages of the Aus-
tralian Watercolor Institute’s
annual exhibition. Little can be
done about the first two ; but it
might be a good thing for the
institute to consider limiting the
number of exhibits since, in such
a huge collection, good work
usually suffers from being
jostled by inferiors.
This criticism naturally applies
to all large mixed exhibitions,
and is offered with caution, since
prolific painting is in itself a
healthy sign. And, despite every-
thing, the watercolors at the
Education Department Galleries
come out very well. There is an
interesting departure in the style
of Rah Fizelle, who, painting
eroded rocks and tree-stumps’,
as do countless contemporary
painters, has, unlike the count-
less artists, given them color and
light. “Cycle,” a simple tree-
stump resting on green earth, is
enlivened by vivid little dashes
of color, and is not simply a
symbol of death and decay but
of renewal and life. The picture
is, perhaps, a little too-highly
colored and symbolical, with a
charged, swirling wash of sky
behind it, as though the artist
has thought it proper to paint in
the details of the Nitrogen
Cycle and with difficulty re-
strained himself. But other
paintings, “Sentinel, Whale
Beach,” and “Wind Worn,” are
excellent studies of eroded rock,
“Sentinel” —an anvil-shaped
rock with strength and variety
in the form, and with color and
light and the bright washed
illumination proper to rocks on
beaches —is a particularly fine
piece of work, and, like “Cycle,”
it is a symbol of life.
Robert Campbell has four
pictures in the exhibition; his
study of “Old Salt Works, Rott-
nest Island,” in brown curt lines
was bought by the N. S. Wales
Gallery. Dora Jarret’s “Holy
Trinity Church, Berrim^” —a
solid bulk of church thrusting
out from a. dark landscape;
striking, competent and a little
mannered —was also bought by
the Gallery, as were A. J.
Murch’s “Girl with a Goat,”
Lorna Muir Nimmo’s “Collit’s
Inn and the Dark Pines,” Frank
McNamara’s “Pyrmont Bridge”
and Erik Langker’s “River Re-
flections,” the last two for the
Marshall Bequest, “River Re-
flections” is a mild little piece of
work, “Collit’s Inn and Dark
Pines” is green, grey and cold,
while Murch’s “Girl with a
Goat” is typical in its quiet
charm, though not very strongly
girlish or goatish.
McNamara has two other
watercolors, “April 25th” and
“April Afternoon, Newport.”
The first is something like
“Pyrmont Bridge,” with wet
shiny streets, and the second has
boats and jetty and water caught
in a sort of dark sparkle. All
three paintings are good.- Mc-
Namara has yet to paint a fine
day and to handle color.
But, as is not unusual, the best
paintings in the exhibition were
not those bought by the Gallery.
Margaret Coen has two fine
flowerpieces, “Fall of Snow-
drops” and “Daffodil Time,”
and John Eldershaw has a round
half-dozen “Kiama Street,”
“Brandy Mary, Tumut,”
“Autumn,” “Pether’s Farm,”
“The Headland” and “The
Road, Tumut.” The painting of
“Brandy Mary’s Flat” is rich,
painted with a full clear wash,
and has a splendid grouping of
houses, golden poplars and dark
hills. “Pether’s Farm” is good,
with a fairly typical Eldershaw
grouping of the wooded tip of
a hill poised over a huddle of
house and trees, with grazing
cattle in the foreground. “The
Headland” is a coast study, with
a bold bluff of cliff sinking down
to a frill of sea. Of “Kiama
Street” it should be said that an
artist of Eldershaw’s powers has
no business painting streets and
bakers’ carts.
Two paintings by Norman
Lindsay, “Tawhai and Whana”
(N.F.S.) and “The Death of
Huyssen” (N.F.S.), are splendid
examples of the artist’s power in
two moods. The first, a charac-
terisation from “The Golden
Lover,” is full of moonlight on
masses of New Zealand ferns,
with the two central figures, the
Maori girl and the demon lover,
charging and focussing the
poetry of the composition. “The
Death of Huyssen” is large, rich,
full of brilliant action and
drama, with an equally brilliant
portrayal of character and ex-
ploitation of the richness of
costume.
Other paintings worthy of
mention are Jean Isherwood’s
“Bermagui”; all Townshend’s
paintings, particularly his “Clay
Pits,” with its clear rugged
sparkle ; Marjorie Stewart’s bold
and mannered flower-piece,
“Happy Days”; the solid,
cubistic color of Max Ragless’s
“Mannum, River Murray”;
J. H. E. Flak’s motor-cycling
and carnival vignettes; and
others by Alfred Cook, the late
Frank Medworth, J. W. Maund
and Enid Cambridge.
Industrial Drawings.
Coalminers', wharflaborers,
seamen and ironworkers, drawn
with a sort of sombre sketchi-
ness and most of them working
like blazes, compose an exhibi-
tion of Roy Dalgarno’s In-
dustrial Drawings at the Studio
of Realist Art.
Since part, at least, of the
artist’s intention is ideological
—the emphasis is not so much
on Man, or even Man Working,
as on Working Man—it is not
improper to point out that at
this time there is a certain
flavor of irony about the depic-
tion of coalminers, for instance,
so immoderately occupied. And,
of course, if the drawings were
capable of standing on their
own there would be no place for
irony in fheir inspection, in-
dustrial or otherwise.
A drawing with very little
darkness in it and some charac-
ter in the face was bought by
the N.S.W. National Art Gal-
lery. The best of the bunch, it
is still a doubtful bargain, its
most notable weakness being
the scrabbling and immature
quality of the line, which, in the
darker hues, may be permissible
as an impressionistic - device, but
under the more exacting de-
mands of a white background is
revealed as a definite weakness
of technique.
Considered as purely social
documents, the drawings appear
to err by omission. Beside the
pictures of heroically toiling
miners there should, perhaps, be
drawings in light relief. Dog-
meetings, for instance, and foot-
ball matches. And, for balance,
a drawing of a Sydney worker
warming himself under a cold
shower with blue language would
give the exhibition topical im-
pact. The language, fortunately,
could be indicated by Mr. Dal-
garno’s grim masses of black
ink.
Ginette Neveu.
The French violinist opened
her Sydney Town Hall recitals
with the cheerful Mozart Con-
certo in G Major. The charm-
ing effect of the sudden switch
in the Rondo to an Andante in
the minor key gained point from
Mile. Neveu’s splendid bowing.
Her playing of the unaccom-
panied Bach Chaconne was a
revelation in self-discipline and
a demonstration of complete
mastery over her instrument.
The Brahms Sonata in A Major,
Op. 100, was taken with a broad
sweep and depth of tone which
brought out all its grandeur and
romanticism.
In subsequent recitals the
finest playing was performed in
the Cesar Franck A Major
Sonata. In further concerts two
delightful short Corelli works, a
Vitali Chaconne, the Beethoven
Sonata in G Major, Op. 30,
No, 3 and two of Paganini’s
works fully tested the violinist’s
technique and remarkable inter-
pretative ability.
"Julius Caesar."
“C.”: Mayne Lynton is to be
commended for giving the
youngsters, in such productions
as “Julius Caesar,” at Sydney
Royal, something more of Shak-
speare’s characters than the hol-
low shell they tote about in
schoolbags.
As Caesar, Augustus Neville
showed a doddering old man,
giving the impression that, as
well as suffering from “the fall-
ing sickness,” the general was
coming down with Sydney ’flu.
John Faassen, as the lean and
hungry Cassius, and Edward
Smith, an ampler Brutus, suc-
cessfully dispatched Caesar and,
for their acting, deserved better
fates than hara-kiri on the plains
of Philippi.
Mayne Lynton, quieter and
less robust than of old, plays
Antony. Softly he calls the
friends and Romans' back to look
at Caesar, and plants the famous
spawn so cunningly that even
hardened usherettes were think-
ing ill of Brutus, and the toes of
murdered Caesar seemed to
stretch with pleasure at the lines.
“John Loves Mary,” Sydney
Royal’s current offering, is a
light-comedy confection about
the troubles of a U.S, soldier
who marries his cobber’s fiancee
in London simply to get her over
to America. Sundry well-worn
complications ensue, and it takes
a good deal of shaking to make
them fizz. Fortunately, Hartley
Power, June Clyde, Stewart
Long and the rest of the cast are
admirable shakers.

Sydney Minerva is presenting
“Storm in a Teacup,” James
Bridie’s whimsicality about
bureaucracy, human rights and
whatnot in a small Scottish
town. As presented, the play
might just as well be broadcast
—there’s nothing of any import-
ance in the performance that
couldn’t come through a micro-
phone.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Celebration of France’s National Day
concluded with a dance in the Lower
Town Hall which was sponsored by the
Alliance Franpaise de Victoria. In the
official party were the French Consul, M.
Roger Loubere ; Madame Gay, president
of the Alliance Franfaise; the Consul-
General for the U.S.A., Mr. Samuel J.
Fletcher, and his wife, whose black crepe
gown was styled with a deep, heart-shaped
neckline; the U.S. Military Attache,
Colonel Hester, and Mrs. Hester, her
flame crepe bodice encrusted with gold
sequins and worn with a black skirt; the
representative of the Consul for China,
Mr. Lui, and his wife, and the Consul
for Chile, Mr. Le Plastriere, and Mrs.
Le Plastriere, she wearing a black velvet
gown. The secretary of the Alliance,
Madame Cockerton, was impressive in a
burgundy satin gown with its corsage of
fragrant daphne. Mile. Lilian Gay wore
a waterlily-green moire gown fashioned
with narrow shoulder-straps and detach-
able flowing sleeves; Mrs. J. Le Grand’s
ice-blue crepes glittered with silver
paillettes). Mrs. W. Osbaldiston’s black
crepe gown was printed in a design of
red-centred lilies.
Two hostesses, Mesdames K. Hart and
M. Saker, gave a late-afternoon party in
the Orchid Room of the Australia to give
guests, including the press, an opportun-
ity of meeting Dr. Ursula Hoff and
Robert Haines—he is assistant-director
of the National Gallery, which organised
the Exhibition of Modern European
Paintings and Sculpture in the Lower
Town Hall. The paintings, which are
privately owned, include works by Picas-
so, Degas and Augustus John. Among the
sculptures is one by Epstein. All proceeds
will go to the funds of St. Hubert’s
C.E.B.S. Training Farm for Boys at
Yering. The Church of England is ap-
pealing for £50,000 to develop the work
of the Training Farm, and plans to bring
out boys from England to train as
farmers or give them a working know-
ledge of other occupations.
Chief Justice Sir Edmund Herring
opened the exhibition. Lady Herring wore
a black crepe gown with a small matching
jacket, embroidered down the front in
a gold-leaf motif. Busy with programme-
selling were Paddy Wilkinson, whose
black dinner gown was covered with a
white lambswool coat, Nan Heath, snug
in a long tailored black velvet coat, and
Mrs. lan Potter, whose sweeping gown
was of striped cyclamen taffeta. Mrs.
Rupert Downes covered her hyacinth-blue
dinner gown with a dyed-ermine coat.
Mrs. Guy Smith was also fur-coated.
Mrs. Philip Dare’s striking black pan-
niered taffeta frock was worn with a blue-
fox coat. Mrs. John Vincent’s dove-grey
gown had a draped skirt and touches of
chartreuse on the bodice. With her aqua-
blue gown Mrs. Essington Lewis wore a
short ermine cape. Mrs. H. G. Connell’s
wine-toned crepe beaded gown was worn
with a matching velvet coat. Mrs. Basil
Hart took the eye in a flowing taffeta-
tailored coat of French brocade striped
in gold, blue, green and black. Mrs.
Esmond Lillies chose black-ring velvet.
Black taffeta was Mrs. Roger Fairbairn’s
choice.
Melbourne Grammar Chapel was the
venue for the marriage of Mrs. Marion
Mary Tibbetts, only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. E. V. Hoban, of Kew, and Hugh
Guthrie Ramsay, son of Commander and
Mrs. H. M. Ramsay, of South Yarra.
Mary wore a ballerina frock of pinky-
beige lace with a sunray-pleated skirt and
matching bonnet-shaped lace hat trimmed
with pink and green flowers. Her only
attendant was Margaret Neville, whose
ballerina-length brown georgette frock
was worn with a pinky-beige straw
bonnet trimmed with matching flowers
and ribbon. Kenneth Tucker was best
man. The reception was held at the Aus-
tralia.
Stage dressing was picturesque for “The
Winslow Boy”—large hats heavily laden
with flowers and feathers, hobble skirts
and exaggerated peplums were worn by
Kathleen Robinson and Jessica Noad. In
the audience dressing was not all of a
piece—the formal rubbed shoulders with
the more homely tweed coats and suits.
Mrs. Garnet Carroll covered her white
gold-beaded crepe gown with a white-fox
cape. With her was Mrs. Ben Blue, wife
of the visiting American comedian, in a
ballerina-length frock of dove-grey and
mink cape stole. Mrs. Leo Britt, whose
husband will be in the Noel Coward
play coming to the Princess, wore a long,
form-fitting black crepe frock. Mrs.
George Griffith’s pastel-blue draped gown
was highlighted with silver sequins. Her
daughter Carol was dainty in blue-spotted
tulle over cyclamen taffeta. Mrs. Alex.
Finlay’s black crepe gown had a deep
yoke of white satin embroidered in gold
beads. Mrs. Bowen Pain chose a French
velvet gown patterned with glowing
autumn flowers. Mrs. A. G. Warner com-
bined black velvet and a grey squirrel
coat. Mrs. Henry Dennett wore hyacinth-
blue. Mrs. Lloyd Brind’s turquoise-blue
crepe gown was heavily embroidered with
gold sequins. Mrs, Peter Thornley’s
white crepes carried crystal beads. Lady
Robinson was in black velvet and grey
squirrel coat. Mrs. Ada Colman’s short
frock of aqua-blue crepe had a draped
skirt. Mrs. F. C. Irvine wore a Persian-
lamb coat over her black gown.
Lovely subject of this John Warlow
portrait is Helen, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Douglas W. London, of Garden-
vale, who as “Miss Blood Bank” has been
nominated by the Red Cross Transfusion
Service for the Miss Australia Quest.
Helen was' educated at the C.E.G.G.S.,
Merton Hall, did a course of dress
designing at the Melbourne Technical
College, and for the past 12 months has
been working with the Blood Bank at the
Royal Melbourne Hospital.
At Moonee Valley one racegoer
staggered every other woman in the pad-
dock by appearing in a grey moire taffeta
ballerina frock, but generally the day was
given to more seasonal clothes. Color
was lent by the many gay wool jackets
worn with contrasting skirts. Striking
was the henna-toned wool tailored coat
worn by Mrs. A. L. Walters. For con-
trast she topped it with a swept off-the-
face felt hat with trailing streamers of
veiling, all in hunters-green. Mrs. John
Nancarrow’s natty grey suitings were
worn with a small grey-and-white felt
boater, trimmed with veiling patterned
with red, green and gold chenille. Judith
Silk added a small leopard-skin hat and
shoulder bag to her fine-checked tailored
suit in brown and beige. Anne Wilton’s
red knitted cap and red gloves went
smartly with her tweed suit with its green
and-red weave. A feathered green cap
gave a sporty finish to Honor Furze-
Morrish’s green and brown tweed suit.
Mrs. Peter Watkins matched her tailored
coat of azure-blue wool with a felt hat.
Mrs. Edward Campbell was in junior
navy, with a cyclamen-jersey turban for
contrast. Her sister, Nancy Woodrow,
wore a small winter-white, brown trimmed
felt hat with her grey suit. A ruby-red
corduroy jacket suit was Mrs. S. T.
Davies’s choice. Mrs. Geoff Berger’s
royal-blue coat with its silver-fox collar
was topped with a matching felt hat.
University circles are keenly interested
in the engagement of Winsome, only child
of Mrs. Comport, and the late H. O.
Comport, to Derek, younger son of Mr.
and Mrs. A. Wright Denniss, of East
Malvern. Winsome, who played pennant
tennis for ’Varsity, and graduated in Arts
last year, hopes to clinch her Bachelor of
Commerce degree this year. Her fiance,
a Bachelor of Mining Engineering, is
with the Zinc Corporation at Broken Hill.
Mr. and Mrs. Frank O’Collins, of
Frankston, have received news that
daughter Moira Shelton is on her way
home from England with baby Stewart,
husband Jim having gone to the U.S.A.
for further clinical work; and that other
daughter Dympna was in Sweden with
the Cravens, of Adelaide, after having
been “presented” and been a guest at a
big Dorchester party in honor of Princess
Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh.
After Sweden Dympna goes to Scotland
and the Hebrides ; on the latter jaunt she
will be accompanied by Mrs. W. Caw-
thorne, wife of the Deputy-Chief-of-Staff
of the Pakistan Army.
From Sydney
Parties for the Old Vic. Company held
the spotlight last week. There was the
after-the-show rally given by the directors
and members of the cast of the present
Minerva production. The big affair was
an afternoon-party given by the Actors
and Announcers’ Equity. This was in the
Savarin, and the long, narrow room was
soon crowded with stage, radio and film
personalities. Sir Laurence and Lady
Olivier, surrounded by 40 members of
the Old Vic, Company, were there. Lady
Olivier’s new topcoat —at least new to
Sydney—was the centre of attraction.
This Christian Dior model was in black-
and-white tweed. It was long, and had
Magyar sleeves, the cuffs of which were
tied with a narrow band of the material.
Her small black sailor hat was banded in
white, and a small white bow stood very
upright in front. The guests were re-
ceived by John Dease, Hal Lashwood
and Wilson Irving. Each of the women
was presented with orchids. Lady Olivier’s
prize bloom was in beautiful mauve
tonings.
Sir Laurence and Lady Olivier moved
about talking in an easy and friendly
fashion with most of the guests. One
guest with whom they held animated con-
verse was eight-year-old Nicky Yardley,
whom you will remember starred in the
film “Bush Christmas,” and was Tom in
“Tom and the Waterbabies.” Sydney s
one and only Mo (Roy Rene) was at this
party ; so was actor and playwright Frank
Harvey. It was recalled that Sir Laurence
played the part of an airman in the
London production of Frank’s play,
“The Last Enemy.”
On one point Sir Laurence was very
firm —that was refusing to select a site
for a National Theatre.
Up in David Jones’s Art Gallery there
is an exhibition interesting from the point
of view of theatre in our midst. Though
indeed when visited a few days after the
opening this show seemed to be making
very little stir indeed, judging by the few
stragglers enjoying its merits. There are
merits in this “Design for Theatre” show,
and theatre-going Sydneyites can view at
close range work by Amie Kingston and
William Constable, who have supplied
the decor for so many professional shows
in the city. Frequenters of the Inde-
pendent, New Theatre and Bryant’s will
find their favorite Cedric Flowers’s work
about the walls. The costumes by Ken-
neth Rowell (doing work just now for
the Ballet Rambert) for Salome are very
attractive. The decor for the. Rev. Alan
Tory’s recent play “Festival for Simon”
can be studied by admirers. It is the
work of Robin Lovejoy. This show is a
vital bit of Sydney week, because it shows
that our artists are infused with enthusi-
asm for the living theatre. If our artists
and writers can get together a national
drama could fruit and ripen as sweetly
as a citrus orchard. It does not depend
on any Canberra-given pile of stone.
Tall and blonde Maree Marsden, of
Melbourne, was born in England 22
years ago. She is the latest addition to
the ranks of Australian film actresses,
and makes her cinema debut in “Strong
Is the Seed,” which Arthur Collins, late
of Hollywood, has just completed in
Sydney. She plays the part of Nina, wife
of William Farrer, famous pioneer of
Australian. wheat development. Maree
left an office job to take up photographic
modelling and mannequin work, became
interested in the theatre and took up
dramatic art as a career. She was appear-
ing with the Melbourne Little Theatre
when Arthur Collins chose her for lead-
ing woman in “Strong Is the Seed.” In
private life she is Mrs. Peter Whitehead.
Her husband is an Englishman, and in
her spare time Maree, who is an ac-
complished horsewoman, helps him to
school horses for export. In addition
she finds time to design and make all her
own clothes.
Perhaps more than anything in the
State the Sydney Hospital is a memorial
to the wisdom and humanitarian feelings
of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, its
founder. This amazing institution is part
of our city, and every citizen should sup-
port it in every way. A chance to help
and also have a night’s fun will be given
on August 11. The Sydney Hospital
Ball is a date to remember. On that night
the ballroom of the Wentworth on old
Church Hill will be the scene of the
revels. There’s a good committee,
headed by Mrs. G. Schartl as president.
The night’s official guests will be
chairman of the Hospitals Commis-
sion, Dr. A. B. Lilley, and Mrs. Lilley,
and president of the Sydney Hospital,
knight Norman Paul, and his wife. If
you are seeking tickets ring BW 6934.
Another of the Fagans of Mandurama
faces matrimony. This time it is Bill,
and he and graceful Coralie Kelly, of
Sydney, will be married on September 4.
Honeymoon’s a trip to England.
The English artists Webster Booth,
tenor, and Anne Ziegler,, soprano, will
give a series of concerts in the Sydney
Town Hall under the direction of J. and
N. Tait, commencing on Tuesday,
August 3. Husband and wife in real life,
these two stars: are well known through
the radio and films. They have given
several command performances in Eng-
land. Both appeared in the English films
“Waltztime” and “The Vagabond King,”
and will shortly be seen in the techni-
color film “The Laughing Lady.”
Sir Laurence and Lady Olivier,
who are unable to attend Ginette
Neveu’s recitals, went along to one
of the rehearsals of this noted French
violinist last week. Ginette, who
is dark-haired and dark-eyed, has
a most engaging smile. So far
she has appeared in concerts in either
black or white. One white frock to which
she is addicted is of heavy crepe, the skirt
very full and soft and falling in classic
folds ; on the peasant-like sleeves is a wide
band of silver and gold beads caught in
at the wrist. A black frock worn by this
player has great charm. Its slim tight
bodice is sleeveless, and from the waist
the skirt is very full and spreading and
has its hemline embroidered in a deep
band of glittering sequins.
William Shakspeare did not entirely
depend last week upon the publicity given
to him by the Old Vic. Company. Mr,
Mayne Lynton began a very interesting
presentation of “Julius Caesar” in the
Theatre Royal on last Thursday after-
noon. This was continued on Friday of
last week, and will be played again to-
morrow and Friday at the same address.
Although the packed audience was in
great part made up of school and college
girls and boys, there were many grown-
ups. Many of the grown-ups recalled, a
little regretful longing in their voices,
the seasons of Shakspeare which Allan
Wilkie gave in this city. The girls were
very good. So was the Caesar of the
piece, Augustus Neville, until he got
bumped off in his prime, and Mayne
Lynton’s Mark Antony spoke with really
noble inflections in the oration over
Caesar’s body. Altogether it is very good
for the dramatic health of a country to
have these Shakspearian productions
acted by groups of home-grown actors
and actresses.
The Minister of Belgium, Mr. Paul B.
Verstraeten, has sent out cards for a re-
ception on the occasion of his country’s
national Commemoration Day. The func-
tion will be held at the Australia this
afternoon from five till seven.
The gala presentation of the new
Christian Dior models threatens to rival
any first-night theatrical opening Sydney
has known. This will be in the restaurant
of David Jones’s Elizabeth-street store on
Saturday, July 31. The performance
starts at 8.30, doors open at eight o’clock.
Congratulations to the Hugh Munrosi
on their golden wedding. This was cele-
brated by a big family party at the home-
stead, Keera, Bingara, to which the
married sons and daughter, Mrs. Nivison,
brought the Munro grandchildren, Mrs.
Munro’s gift from her children was a
gold watch, father’s gift a Packard car.
Mrs. Munro is planning a six-weeks
holiday in Darwin. She hopes to leave
by plane during the week.
It was a crowded gallery for the open-
ing by Eugene Goossens of the Australian
Watercolorists’ 25th annual exhibition.
Greatly admired among the Gallery pur-
chases were Erik Langker’s “George’s
River,” a gem of afternoon light and
shade, Dora Jarret’s “Holy Trinity
Church, Berrima,” and the “Dark Pines”
of Lorna Muir Nimmo, Arthur Murch
was another of the congratulated.
Among the guests were Mrs. Frank
Medworth and two young daughters.
News comes from London that John
Preece is back in his flat at Chelsea after
attending the International P.E.N. Con-
gress at Copenhagen. Among the 29
countries represented and with over 300
members of the P.E.N. he was the only
Australian present. After the congress
he went through Germany to Holland,
there meeting booksellers, publishers and
personal friends and a number of Dutch
writers. Holland’s leading weekly paper,
“Vrij Nederland,” has appointed him
its Australian correspondent and has
arranged for an exchange of articles deal-
ing with the cultural life of both coun-
tries. He will return to Australia at the
end of August.


THE SERVICE MAN
Arms and Malaya.
“Ek Dum”; The situation in
Malaya has reached a stage at
which no European life in cer-
tain areas is safe, and in which
the only thing which separates
the present condition of affairs
from full-scale civil war is the
lack of an openly admitted co-
ordinated command, which the
organisers of murder and
rapine are not likely to establish
until they are pressed.
Mr. Chifley’s and Mr. Mal-
colm MacDonald’s easygoing
public assumption that the
present movement can be
brought under control is all too
optimistic. The policy of the
Communists has been plain for
a long time. Furtively but'
thoroughly they have estab-
lished huge islands of Commu-
nism in southern China and
Indo-China. They have a large
well-financed organisation in
Australia which has been work-
ing specifically for South Asian
revolution since 1928, when
J. S, Garden had the concept of
the Pan-Pacific Trade Union
organisation head, Solomon
Losovsky, in Moscow —accepted
by the A.C.T.U.
It is significant that overnight,
after the A-C.T.U. took that
decision, the Australian Com-
munist party acquired a new set
of leaders and changed from a
struggling show, living mostly
on Labor finance, to a big busi-
ness with money to burn.
This organisation and that in
Southern China put the whole
East India area in between in a
Communist sandwich, which has
been thickened on the southern
side in the last few weeks by
the creation of a Soviet Legation
at Jokjakarta in Java.
While Communist interests
were being served in Indonesia
by the Japanese-sponsored rebel
elements, the Australian Com-
munist unions held the hands of
the Commonwealth Government.
The British High Commis-
sioner has refused to comment
on a suggestion that Mr. Chifley
has denied help in arms and
otherwise to Malaya because the
Communist unions will not let
him. That is much more
serious because Malaya is part
of Australia’s specific defensive
area. Dr. Evatt and Mr. Curtin
both firmly held that view.
The public should insist on
knowing the facts, and if they
are as alleged they become a
vital matter. If the Government
is taking this stand it has no
right to remain a Government.
Public opinion should, if
what is stated is found to be
true, demand that the Governor-
General should send Mr. Chifley
and his followers to the country
to explain their failure to honor
their obligations to the British
Commonwealth and particularly
their appeasement of the local
agents' of a foreign and hostile
Power.
Danger Grows in
Europe.
‘‘Ek Dum”: In spite of Mr.
Chifley’s assurance that war is
unlikely—a few weeks ago he
was saying that war could not
come for 10 years—happenings
in Europe strongly suggest that
war is possible.
Everything appears to be
working to a directed pattern,
the direction coming from Mos-
cow, apart from the fact that
European events synchronise
with world-wide disturbances,
in all of which Communists
are involved, ranging from the
war in North China to the coal
and gas shortage in Australia,
and from the savage terrorism
of Malaya to the Communist
hampering of settlements in
U.N.0., which is dealing with
the Palestine crisis.
It is becoming more certain
every day that the Russians
have virtually annexed Eastern
Germany and that they propose
to drive the British and Ameri-
cans out of it, They propose to
establish in it a Government like
that of Czechoslovakia —one
which looks German and does
what Moscow tells it and which
hangs an iron curtain along the
border through which no in-
quisitive eyes can effectively
penetrate. It is certain also that
it proposes to annex the rest of
Germany so soon as the British
and Americans can be pushed
out of it.
This intention dominates the
material in the Russian answer
to the Allied Note about Berlin.
The essence of that specious and
prevaricating document is that,
in spite of alleged breaches of
agreement by the English-speak-
ing Allies, Stalin and his sup-
porters are willing to talk the
matter over provided subjects of
the talks include four-Power
control of the Ruhr. In other
words, having got into Berlin
through four-Power control and
flouted every condition of the
agreement under which they are
there, they now propose to lay
the groundwork for an advance
from the Elbe to the Rhine by
the same methods. Were they
to be allowed into the control
of the Ruhr a large Russian
mass would arrive in that region,
a Communist party would be
established on an extensive scale,
and either that party or the
Russians themselves would pre-
sently declare that the Western
Allies) must get out, and the
same game would be played all
over again.
Strategically what is happen-
ing is as ominous as can be.
Large numbers of Russian
troops have moved into the Ber-
lin area and even forward of it
close to the Elbe. Troop move-
ments westward are reported in
the Danube Valley. They are
said by the Turks to be on a
large scale.
The Warsaw Cominform Con-
ference, with Molotov present,
provided an excuse for aggres-
sion against Yugoslavia and the
entry of Russian troops into it
if necessary. Or possibly it was
only providing an atmosphere
in which Tito could mobilise his
forces without raising suspicion
that he was doing so except for
the purpose of protecting him-
self against his dear allies of
Eastern Europe. It may even be
that the whole game is being
played in the hope that the Wes-
tern Powers will take him to
their bosoms and give him their
confidence, so that Moscow may
know what they are about. The
fact that the Albanians have
been so loud in their denuncia-
tion of Yugoslavia and their
positive action against that
country gives good ground for
suspicion.
Next, “a Sicilian law student”
goes to Italy’s Parliament House
and pumps a few shots into the
hide of Togliatti, the Moscow-
trained Communist ruffian who
is boss of a large mass of mur-
derous elements, including a
large number of old-time Fascist
leaders, which forms the Com-
munist party. This was the sig-
nal for an outburst of organised
violence throughout the country,
which proved the power of the
Communists to organise insur-
rection.
The rioting had the approval
of Moscow. Stalin sent a mes-
sage which expressed his sense
of indignation at this brutal
attempt on the life of a Com-
munist saint:
The Soviet Communist party is
outraged by an outcast of humanity’s
villainous attempt on the life of a
leader of the working classes.
The ghosts of the millions of
men, women and children who
have been done to death in cold
blood by Stalin and his agents
must have filled the spirit world
with cynical laughter as they
heard this indignant message
passing through the cold ether.
However, in the face of a
stronger show of authority by
the Government than was ex-
pected, the strike collapsed, too
suddenly to allow it to be be-
lieved that it was not both pro-
duced and ended by a Com-
munist organisation with dis-
ciplined headquarters and forces
obedient to it throughout Italy,
At the same time the Com-
munists of Paris and other great
cities of France were endeavor-
ing to extend a strike of civil
servants. The strike is being par-
ticularly aimed at communica-
tions and postal services.
The German position becomes
daily more untenable. While
the Western Allies have the
greatest difficulty in maintaining
even emergency supplies for
western Berlin’s 2,000,000 people
by air, it will be utterly impos-
sible for them to do so later
under winter conditions. And
this the Russians know. Despite
the shouts of wonder from the
daily press at the vastness of the
lifts of Western Allied aircraft,
the fact is that only 20,000-odd
tons had been taken to Berlin
by air since June 19. Compared
with the carriage of men and
material in the Burma campaign,
when something like 674,000
tons was shifted in four months,
the operation is a very minor
one, limited both by the short-
age of the types of aircraft
needed for the kind of transport
involved and particularly by the
shortage of landing space; also
the shortness of runways, which
cuts down loads.
The latest Russian move,
which accompanied the sending
“I don’t need to Work, hut a bloke’s got to do SOMETHINK
to keep is brain active.”
of its reply to the Allied Note,
has been the letting loose of
large numbers of Yak fighters
on the air-transport route, round
which they fly like hornets en-
dangering their own and other
peoples’ lives and deliberately
aiming to hamper flights and
frighten pilots.
Contemporaneously, Moscow
is indulging in a large-scale mili-
tary air pageant, obviously, from
the descriptive broadcasts, meant
to put fear of the mighty Red
Air Force into the hearts of the
Western world.
By July 19 there were horrible
signs which suggested that the
Soviet Union was doing all it
could to provoke war.
Communist journals through-
out the world associated
the United States with the
attempted assassination of Tog-
liatti. The Australian Commu-
nist general secretary (Sharkey)
cabled to Italy the positive state-
ment that “this attack was not
accidental but is the outcome of
the machinations of American
imperialism... .in preparation
for atomic war.”
On the same day 79 Czechs
were arrested and accused of the
normal things which enemies of
Communism are charged with
when the party wishes to immo-
late them —the same things
exactly that the Australia-First
men .were charged with when
they were flung into internment
camps in Australia after the
Communist party had demanded
their internment and branded
them as “Trotskyites”: espion-
age, terrorism, destroying the
means of defence and a plot to
murder public men, all under
the direction of a foreign Power,
which in this case is the United
States. It was Britain and Ger-
many in the case of the original
Rightists and Trotskyites in
Moscow, Japan in the case of
the Australia-First men. When
the last cables left Prague before
this issue went to press it looked
as if the whole range of the
opponents of Communism was
involved.
The Western Powers’ actions
are stem and ominous. It is
reported that the United States
and Canada are about to join
the union of Western nations in
Europe, thus integrating their
defence with that of France, the
Benelux countries and Italy.
France faces, as this is written,
a crisis on its defence estimates
which is really a struggle be-
tween the Communist and near-
Communist elements, which
love Socialism or Russia more
than their country, and the
patriotic section of Frenchmen.
There is talk of sending
armed convoys by land into
Berlin, a ban on Russian ship-
ping passing through the
Panama Canal and the imposi-
tion of economic sanctions
against the U.S.S.R. —which, in-
cidentally, is buying Australian
wool of a type used for uni-
forms and military purposes with-
out the Federal Government lift-
ing a finger to control the traffic.
Whatever Russian intentions,
there is little question that
Russia has been building up its
industrial and military strength
during the past three years, par-
ticularly in the air and in armor
and transport and oil produc-
tion, while the rest of the world
has been demobilising in a fools’
paradise.
All-in in Palestine.
“Ek Dum”: The Jews having
rejected Count Bernadette’s
peace proposals for Palestine,
which had already been rejected
by the Arabs, there was a fran-
tic scramble at U.N.O. to save
face, while Arabs and Jews once
more opened fire on each other.
In this new round of the war
the Arabs, as had been expected,
did not show the same force
and drive as in their early on-
slaught. They are not a patient
people. Once started in a fight
they will fight, but an Arab is
inclined to go home if he is
asked to sit around in a camp
while somebody else, argues.
Furthermore, during the re-
cess the Jews appeared to have
gained new strength and
materiel. The truce ended on
July 9, and within a few hours
the air resounded with the news
of great victories, of which
there seemed to be plenty to go
round. Each of the two com-
batants beat the other soundly
in what was represented as a
fierce battle at Lake Hula, on
the north-eastern front. The
Arabs claimed an advance to-
wards Tel Aviv, but the Jews
shouted that they had taken
Lydda airport. The Lebanese,
who had been trying hard to
make themselves heard above
the cries of victory from more
accessible wielders of the loud
timbrel, now got a word in edge-
ways to declare that they had
slaughtered 213 Israelis on the
northern border, but their shout
of triumph was drowned in the
roar of Egypt rejoicing at the
havoc wrought by a whole eight
bombs in Tel Aviv.
Fired with a proper spirit of
emulation, the Jews in New
Jerusalem let fly at the old city
with 100 mortar bombs. The
count of target results showed
that they had collected one hos-
pital, a convent or two and a
few windows in the British
Consulate, while a sniper’s bul-
let (an ungrateful missile)
plunged into the U.S. Consul-
General’s car without injuring
that anxious friend of Jewry—
he was one of the tribe Mc-
Donald. No Arab casualties
were mentioned.
,At that stage “noises off”
were heard which, to the intent
ear, resolved themselves as the
bewildered grumblings of Am-
man at the inexplicable lack of
sportsmanship on the part of the
British in clamping down on
the arms supply. The sound of
wings was heard from Rhodes,
where Count Bernadette was
taking off for Lake Success,
some of the denizens of which
apparently have still faith in him
as a Colossus.
He carried with him the
promise of the Israelis' that they
would agree to another 10 days
of cease-fire in Palestine, to be-
gin at 10 a.m. on July 10, only
a few hours after the reopen-
ing of hostilities. Inexplicably
the Arabs, who were supposed
to be beaten to a frazzle, refused
to agree, so Count Bernadotte
rushed off to U.N.O. to inform
it that “prompt and effective
action by the Security Council
now could well be the decisive
factor in solving the problem.”
So it could, but U.N.O. is in-
capable of it.
Meanwhile it was estimated
by the press that 100,000 Jewish
troops of Haganah and the
militia and 10,000 bloodthirsty
ruffians of the Irgun Zvai Leumi
—now courteously referred to
by the Australian press agencies
as a “dissident Jewish organisa-
tion” —were whaling into any-
thing (according to taste) from
40,000 to 100,000 Arabs’, whose
forces appeared to be making
heavy weather against a very
well-conducted and strategically-
correct Jewish campaign, reach-
ing out from the core of central
strength and with every advan-
tage in armament and world sup-
port on the Israelite side.
Uncle Sam, with an election
on his hands, and Britain at
once urged U.N.O. to issue the
new cease-fire order, disobedi-
ence after three days to be
punished by declaring the
offender “responsible for a peace
breach and subject to U.N.O.
penalties.” The combatants were
apparently too busy on the
Ramleh and south-of-Tel-Aviv
fronts and the Jerusalem con-
voy-road to burst out laughing,
even when five other nation-
members of the Council — i.e.,
the junior diplomats who repre-
sent them supported the
motion. It went without saying
that the proceedings would de-
velop into the usual farce, with
the Western Powers making pro-
posals and Mr. Gromyko sul-
lenly rejecting them and making
counter-proposals.
Mr. Gromyko came straight
out;, on the side of Israel. He
moved that the name of Count
Bernadotte should be struck off
the record in recognition of the
fact that the Count’s mediation
proposals ignored the U.N.O.
settlement of last November,
which provided for an independ-
ent Israeli State. Mr. Gromyko
is all for this, even if it is
achieved by military sanctions.
He knows that his stand pro-
vides awkward problems for
both the British, with their tra-
ditional Arab friendship, and for
the Americans, with their elec-
tion campaign. And he also may
have other fish, to fry in view of
what is happening in Europe.
On the day that the debate
opened the combatants in
Palestine curbed their rage
almost to the point of extinguish-
ing it. Palestine, in fact, was
nearly as quiet as Canberra,
where one of the lions of Judah,
the father of the Palestine settle-
ment of yesteryear, was resting
on his laurels and seemingly
hoping that nobody would re-
member his? name in connection
with it. Eventually, after bitter
fighting at Jerusalem it was re-
ported on July 18 that both sides
had agreed to accept the new
cease-fire order as from 1 a.m.
(Sydney time) on July 19.
But the pause amounts only
Jo a rest between rounds.

John Dalton , an English Quaker, was the first
to propound the theory that the atom was the
smallest particle of matter imaginable—a theory
that was not assailed until more than a century
later. Even in Dalton’s day, the idea that matter
was composed of small indivisible particles was
not new. A similar theory had been put forward
by the Greek philosopher Democritus two thousand
years earlier. Sir Isaac Newton had restated it
as the “corpuscular theory” a hundred years before
Dalton. Where Dalton excelled them was in
formulating these theories in abvay that explained
known chemical processes, and enabled deductions
to be made which could be submitted to the test
of practical experiment. In short, he translated them
from philosophical abstractions into a method for
accurately forecasting and controlling chemical
reactions and manufacturing processes.
Dalton, the son of a weaver, was born in 1766.
He went to work at the age of I'2, but studied in
his spare time to such effect that in 1793 the
Manchester Academy appointed him tutor in
mathematics and natural science. Six years later
he set himself up as a private teacher, devoting
his leisure to research and the fashioning of his
Atomic Theory, which was first published in
1808 in his book “A New System of Chemical
Philosophy.” Dalton's theory, unaltered in its
essentials, is still used to explain the laws of
chemical combination. Dalton’s work
was the basis of the knowledge
which enabled British scientists to
contribute so much to the startling
development of atomic disintegra-
tion.

RED MILL RUM.
A welcome string of well-backed
winners at Canterbury on Saturday
recompensed the smallish crowd of
racegoers who braved the coldest day
in 70-odd years with its accompani-
ment of rain, hail and all else short
of snow —or was there snow?
Standing head and shoulders, as he
does, above anything else at present
in training, Columnist must have a
second-to-none chance in either leg
of the S-T.C.’s forthcoming winter
double. However, risk of incurring
a penalty may prompt connections to
pass over the £3OOO sprint and tackle
only the £5OOO Cup.
In the absence of Columnist, one
of the hardest to beat in, the sprint
must be the brilliant three-year-old
Deep Sea, who scored a runaway win
in Saturday’s Flying Handicap (7£f.).
Ridden by E. Fordyce, the Nizami
colt carried 9st., made all the run-
ning, and was four lengths clear of
Hava Chat and Ulterior at the finish.
For the Winter Handicap at Rosehill
he drops in the weights to 8.5, the
distance being seven furlongs. Others
likely to be near the money are The
Groom, Hpmeleigh Dick and Karachi.
With a maximum topweight of 9.7
for the 12-furlongs S.T.C. Cup,
lesser lights are too close to Columnist
in the weights to be given much show
of beating him. However, should
things go amiss with the “good
thing,” one very likely to be near
the money is Silver Link, who, in
winning Saturday’s Canterbury Park
Handicap, showed his first glimpse
of form since prior to his unsuccess-
ful trip to New Zealand. Carrying
topweight of 8.13, he finished strongly
to down High Order and Drummer
Boy in time only a second worse than
the course record, and the track was
far from favorable. Silver Link drops
half a stone to 8.3 for the Cup, and
he’s very much at home over the
Rosehill mile-and-a-half journey.
A wine firm, whose advertisement
in a weekly trade journal includes
a couple of “best bets” for the
morrow’s racing, made the seemingly
facetious choice of All Spirit and.
Cognac as their selections for Can-
terbury. Surprisingly, W. Cook
managed to land this bibulous double,
All Spirit taking the second Two-year-
old Handicap, and Cognac the second
Mixed Stakes (6f.); moreover, both
were favorites.
J. Thompson and E. Fordyce also
each landed a double. Thompson
took the Three- and Four-year-old
Maiden Stakes on the Ajax colt
Faraway and the first Mixed Stakes
on Mortar—another pair of favorites.
Fordyce, having scored with Deep
Sea, also won the Welter with Skilled,
The first Two-year-old went to The
Duke (F. Delaney).

At Moonee Valley, Melbourne
Hunt Club held the first Saturday
meeting it has had in 20 years. The
weather was fine but nippy, as it
should be in the jumping season, and
the track was excellent.
The most interesting, if not the
best-endowed race of the day, was
the Hunt Club’s Cup of £350, plus
trophy, “for horses which have, in
the opinion of the committee, been
fairly hunted with any recognised
pack of hounds twice during 1948.
There were amateur riders aboard
six of the 11 runners, including
favorite Hopwood (Colonel J. F.
Forster). Unfortunately Hopwood,
along with several others, failed to
see out the trip and the winner was
second-favorite Paroxena (W. Carter),
beating Waib'on and Gay Shepherd
by large margins. Paroxena looks
capable of better things. The Oak-
lands Steeple, also over two miles,
was won by the much-improved
’chaser Cheery Boy, an aged son of
Cimbrian.
An exceptionally good effort was
returned by the John James colt Beau
John (N. Powell) in winning the
Springbank Handicap for three- and
fpur-year-olds. The handicapper had
given him 9st., Mahram 8.9, Our
Land Bst. and the rest well below
fist. Within easy reach of the leaders
all the way, Beau John went to the
flont entering the straight and, win-
ning by four lengths from Foxacre
and Mahram, clocked course-record
time of 1.1 li for the six furlongs
less 20yds. Winning the second
division of the same race from
Dhotrium and Irregular, country per-
former Armentier (R. Heather) also
did reasonably well, clocking 1.12;
the previous record was True Law’s
I.ll*.
• . / « •
Excellent handicapping was evident
in the finish of the Arundel Handi-
cap for two-year-old colts; a length
and a half covered the first four,
whose weights ranged from 7.9 up
to 9st. Waezieri (J. Purtell) just
shaded Royal Monarch, then a half-
head to King Simeon and a further
half-length to topweight Bartolus.
There was much more daylight in the
finish of a similar event for fillies,
with Star of the East (D. Barclay)
an easy winner from Atomic Lass
and Last Trick.
Backers of Golden Gem in the
Inverness Handicap (13f.) bad to
accept odds of 11 to 4, but with
Badger riding in his very best form
their cash was safe, the Golden
Promise gelding winning well enough
from Sunhaven and Real Guy. It
was Golden Gem’s 20th win—most
of them on provincial tracks —and
he seems a fair bargain at an original
cost of 25 guineas. The mile Glende-
war Welter was won by the favorite,
Law Case.

Cardinal Color, who ran a place,
and one or two other horses, com-
peted at Canterbury on Saturday in
fulfilment of one of the last wishes
expressed by their trainer, Dudley
Allsop, who died at his Randwick
home towards the end of last week.
Allsop was held in high regard in
Turf circles as a very good chap
and was a trainer with an excellent
team, as was his father before him —
until the father had to give up through
blindness; he went to Germany for
treatment, and was there when the
1914 war broke out, but was allowed
to return. Like the Kelsos, with
whom they, are connected, Allsops
have been at Randwick for the best
part of a century. In each case a
son is carrying on the tradition.

American racegoers must be won-
dering what on earth to think of
Australian form—as represented there
by Shannon. He has mingled bril-
liant wins with runs which wouldn’t
beat a field of Percherons. On Satur-
day, after some miserable failures, he
very easily won the 100,000 dollars
Hollywood Gold Cup from his stable-
mate On Trust and the Santa Anita
Handicap-winner Olhaverry.
Shannon’s cut of the prize was
£21,125, by far the richest prize ever
won by an Australian horse, and
some couple of thousand pounds
more than his total winnings in Aus-
tralia. The win raised his total stake-
earnings to over £53,500, second only
to Phar Lap (£66,738) among Aus-
tralian money-winner, 1 }; when he left
for America he wasn’t in the first
40 —which gives some idea of the
present scale of stakes in America
and also shows the absurdity of com-
paring horses on a basis of prize-
money won by them.

The official Australian Davis Cup
team —that is, the team from which
Bromwich • and Sedgman were ex-
cluded —has arrived in Havana to
play Cuba in the first round. Brom-
wich and Sedgman, having given Aus-
tralia its first good year at Wimble-
don since Crawford was in his prime,
are pottering round Europe —Brom-
wich due to return here, while the
A.L.T.A. has graciously given Sedg-
man permission to tour the U.S.A.
at somebody else’s expense.
* * * *
Most troubled member of the Aus-
tralian Olympic team is pedestrian
George Knott, who has belatedly dis-
covered that his walking style, satis-
factory to Australian judges, does
not pass in England, where he has
been disqualified at his only two
starts. Still, this is hardly surprising
when one considers that Australia,
which has always produced oarsmen
of world class, and has sent a sculler
and a four to the coming Games,
doesn’t hold one solitary important
race over the standard Olympic dis-
tance of 2000 metres, preferring the
archaic three-miler.
Other members of the team, how-
ever, have been having a good spin.
A trip to Eire netted them, apart
from some good tucker, a pile of
titles and trophies, and Curotta broke
the local 300yds. record by recording
31sec. Back in England they swept
through a programme of special in-
vitation events at Motspur Park.
Australian marksmen overseas have
been doing well. Members of the
rifle teaip bagged a bunch of prizes
in early stages of the King’s Prize
shoot at Bisley. Five of them quali-
fied for the final stage, and Victorian
Percy Pavey became the first Aus-
tralian to win the coveted prize since
1907. Field-Marshal Montgomery
handed oyer the cheque—£2so.

The cricketers:
England had reason to suspect the
presence of a cross-eyed Chinaman
when rain washed out the third Test
at Old Trafford, Manchester. Under
favorable and even conditions, Aus-
tralia was down 142 runs on the first
innings, which England improved to
316 with seven wickets in hand on
the third day. Then rain set in,
“If he tries any clinches you'll be all set.”
completely washing out the fourth
day, and allowing only 160 minutes
of play on the fifth day. Yardley,
of course, declared at once, and the
tourists went in with no other in-
tention than to play out time. Eng-
land’s hopes were raised for a moment
when substitute-opener lan Johnson
was quickly dismissed, but then Mor-
ris and Bradman, rarely even
changing ends, gave a deadly display
of stonewalling which saw out the
day. Spectators were treated to the
unbelievable spectacle of Bradman
playing a dead bat to a slow full-
toss.

Nothing occurred on Saturday to
alter the composition of the V.F.L.
“four,” though Fitzroy, leaders until
a fortnight before, suffered their
second successive defeat, this time
by Carlton, well down the list but
now showing the old “Blues” form.
Fitzroy tried using weight, but Carl-
ton proved the old axiom that speed
on the ground and dominance in the
air can beat anything and won by
16.17 to 12.12. Collingwood, still
on top, got a fright from “Sowth”
in the second quarter, and in a
scared manner kicked 13.16 to 10.12.
Essendon ran all over Hhwthorn,
18.14-9.12, and Melbourne allowed
St, Kllda to retain its record of
no wins by booting 24.19 to 8.10.
Out at North Melbourne the on-
coming Geelong side lost its star,
White, lost the lead and then tost
North Melbpurne in a whirling finish
—Geelong by 10.15-10.8. Richmond
stayed in “the four” by downing
Footscray, 12,9-10.14.
Rugby Union: Eastern Suburbs,
playing wet-weather football in Satur-
day’s blizzard, downed Manly 11-8 at
Waverley Oval; lock Webb, playing
as emergency centre, ran and handled
well and scored a decisive try. Eastes,
playing again for Manly, made a few
good runs, but the conditions were
more favorable for swimming than
sprinting. In other games, Gordon
drew with Drummoyne, 3-all; Wests
beat Parramatta 3-nil; University beat
Northern Suburbs 9-6; St. George
swamped Eastwood 22-3.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Bo”: Whenever Jim Margetts came
into the township his favorite subject over
a pot or two with his cronies would be
the utter uselessness of Harry, his “hand,”
Apparently Jim’s request to do anything
remotely resembling hard work would
bring from his employee the tired obser-
vation that he might have been able to
do that a few years ago, but he couldn’t
take it now. The burden of Harry’s com-
plaint was that he’d had work. “Some-
times,” Jim would tell us in his quizzical
way, “I think the dopy cow expects me
to pension him off—and he’d have the
hide to take it if I were to offer it, too.”
From time to time we’d hear of Harry
taking about five minutes to straighten
up after he’d bent down to pick some-
thing up, or of his being found snoring-
off under a tree after doing hardly enough
toil to get his sweat-glands to work for
the first time. Then one afternoon Ted,
the counter-hand at the post-office, came
over with the news that Harry had
brought in a note to him from Jim—he
wanted Ted to fill in an official form for
Harry, “What, is the lazy old cow going
to apply for the old-age pension?” some-
one asked. “Not quite,” grinned Jed.
“Y’ see, Harry’U be twenty-one next
month, and he wanted to know how you
go about getting a vote.”

“Curate’s Egg”; Though less civilised,
the Sunday-afternoon football battles in
the Tully-Cardwell area, N.Q.; are poor
spectacles by comparison with those pro-
vided for earlier residents by the real
Mackay All-Black teams of the day.
These were the “pruns,” or weekly gladia-
torial contests, staged en masse between
the Cardwell and Tully River blacks.
With spears and boomerangs the oppos-
ing teams lined up in a circular clearing,
with gins, piccaninnies and old men as
vociferous supporters. Play did not com-
mence tiff either a member or partisan of
one team had coined an insult worthy of
a spear or boomerang throw. Usually a
bit of carefree bloodshed contributed to
the good time had by all.
* * * *
“Blime”: Each time the two men met
Sam’s big ginger mong never failed to
snarl a challenge at Dick’s kelpie, occa-
sionally bowling the little tyke over for
good measure. Dick smarted under the
affront tiff the day his kelpie turned and
accepted battle. Sam was aiming a kick
into the mix-up when Dick’s protest
halted him. “Frightened your ugly brute’ll
get the licking he deserves, are y’?” he
broke in. “G’on, let him have it ... or
can’t neither of y’ take it?” Sam’s eyes
narrowed, and his claim about taking it
was backed by a straight right on Dick’s
j&w. Two seconds later the noise of the
dogs was punctuated by thuds and grunts
as the men attended their more personal
affair. Blood spouted, eyes grew black,
the landscape swayed, but the two slogged
mercilessly on till Dick went down for
the count. Some time went by before he
moved, drew himself painfully to a sit-
ting position, and from a mutilated
face one half-opened eye roamed the
vicinity. The low moan turned to a
cackle as he drew Sam’s attention. “There
“She’s always bragging about her breeding!”
y’are,” he wheezed triumphantly, pointing
a bleeding finger at the mongs; “I told
y’ Kelp’d belt the daylights out o’ your
ugly sooner. Y’ poor silly cow! ”

“Mat’s Mate”: The match between
Walpebool and Undowangie had been a
slogging affair for three-quarters in
drizzling rain and a cold wind, and when
we puffed up for the final change Mat
was disgusted to find that our Undo-
wangie crowd had brought only oranges
for our refreshment. He eyed his fruit
with aversion, threw it to an admiring
small boy and edged nearer the Walpe-
bool crowd, who were joyfully guzzling
rum and hot water. “How about a nip,
mate?” he asked. “Nick off,” said the
Walpe. captain darkly. “We ain’t nursin’
you Undowangie urgers.” Mat went into
that final quarter with his ears back. He
outmarked and outbumped the Walpe.
skipper, fell on him, sat on him, ran him
ragged ; he dominated the rucks, won the
knockouts, fed rover and forwards and
Undowangie, inspired, slapped on 8.7
and cantered in. As we ran off, passing
the battered and bewildered Walpe. man,
Mat touched his shoulder. “How about a
nip, mate?” he asked, preferring a small
flask he’d got from somewhere.
* * * *
“Zake”: Once saw a cove win a bet
that a pig which had drunk a bucketful
of skim-milk couldn’t weigh any more
than before he had scoffed it. The porker
didn’t. There were a few pounds of milk
in that bucket. My guess is that the milk
created gases which had the effect of
lightening the pig on the scales to the
extent of offsetting the extra poundage
taken on. Any others?

“C.E.”: Steve had worked for Ted
Matheson for so many years the pair had
become firm friends, despite Steve’s prac-
tice of blaming Capitalism for every iff,
and yelling less-work-and-more-pay on
every presentable occasion. When Mathe-
son’s health collapsed and he was taken
away for treatment he turned the place
over to Steve on a profit-sharing arrange-
ment for 12 months. Matheson re-
covered and, at the end of the term,
presented himself back on the farm.
“Well, how did you go?” he greeted
Steve. The old hand lost no time telling
him. Starting on the tax, he roared his
way through shortages, prices, permits,
red-tape, breakages, bad luck, grass-
hoppers and the weather. Then, as a
thought struck him, he paused. A grin
started in his eyes, spread over his mug,
and ended half-way down his neck. “You’ll
be takin’ over again?” he murmured.
“Awright, I ain’t boss no longer.” Kick-
ing off his light boots, he grimly laced
on a pair of hobnails, and took off in the
direction of the hut. “Won’t be long.”
He threw Matheson a diabolic grin. “Just
goin’ to pay a couple o’ lazy, money-
grubbin’ hands what I been secretly prom-
isin’ ’em for the past 12 months.”
* * * *
“Betcha”: In a nature talk on the air
recently a question arose regarding the
origin of the old belief that a snake never
kicked the bucket till sundown. Decision
was that the story was probably fabri-
cated with the object of keeping children
away from the reptile. Seems a bit thin
to me. More likely it had something to
do with a snake’s nervous 'system and
his propensity for wriggling after death.
Have found that a snake is much like
an eel, and sometimes hours after it has
been killed it will give a first-class ex-
hibition of true-to-life wriggling when
handled. Again, the story may have its
roots in the haphazard manner some
blokes give Joe his send-off. Any sort of
hit breaks the long bloke’s back and pins
him to the spot, and often he is left that
way to peg-out in his own good time.
With nothing to do but lie considering his
troubles it is heaven help anything that
ventures within range of his striking head.
After the first bang has halted him surely
it is easy enough to finish the job with
another one on his more troublesome
head.

“Mul”; “Scrubby’s a queer sort o’
bloke,” observed Bill. “Only yesterday
he gets into a stew because the cows
broke out of the house-paddock into the
lucerne. He opens the gate on the
lucerne paddock, then tears across the
yard to the house-paddock and opens that
gate, then pushes a strainer into me hand
and starts hammering a staple into a
post to hold a strand of barbed-wire. I
asks him what’s the idea. ‘Tell you
later,’ he hollered back as he concen-
trated on fixing the fence. When we’d
finished he sits down and says ‘You
see. Bill, if the boss was to come home
tonight and find the fence down he’d
make me turn round and fix it before
I milked the cows, but as it is he’ll prob-
ably just call me a lazy swine for leav-
ing the gates open.’ Then suddenly
Scrubby ups and starts tearing the fence
down again. ‘ ’Struth,’ he snorts, T ain’t
goin’ to be called a lazy swine by
nobody !’ ”

“Anthropo”: Traditionally the Aus-
tralian aboriginal in search of a wife
cracked the object of his affection over
the head with a waddy, then dragged her,
unconscious, by the hair to his gunyah.
But not always. Out north-west from
King George’s Sound in Sept., 1830, Dr.
Wilson noticed at one camping-place a
curious object half-hidden in a shrub. A
scrap of netting about the size of the
palm of the hand, woven with alternate
strands of soft human hair and fine native
string. Mokare, native guide, explained.
It was a love token placed there by some
girl of the near-by tribe, woven from her
own hair. It was to be found by her
lover, if he cared to search for it, and
when returned to her would be in the
nature of a love pledge, much as was the
return of a purposely-lost lady’s glove in
the Middle Ages. Such a courtship,
Mokare further explained, was most prob-
ably illicit and, if discovered, would be
attended with unpleasant consequences.
In the effort to avoid these the guilty
lovers might flee to relatives in tribes at
the far end of the nation’s domain,
where, since they brought fresh blood,
they mighty be welcomed and protected.
Or the male, if sturdy enough, might
stand his ground right at home, fight
duels with the girl’s offended brothers
and, if he emerged the victor, take the
maiden by right of conquest.

“Bughouse”: “G’snatcher’s” definition
of light (B. 23/6/’4B) is as obsolete as
phlogiston. Light in modern terms is any
ray that will affect the photographic plate.
And light will penetrate a brick wall.
Prisoners condemned to live in utter dark-
ness, in dungeons deep beneath Castle
walls, gradually acquired sufficient vision
to observe their surroundings, which
shows that some kind of light rays pene-
trated through brick, stone and earth to
a considerable depth. Yet when brought
up to sunlight such prisoners became
temporarily blind, as long as three weeks
being required before normal sight was
regained. Thick muffling of the eyes was
necessary ; if this was neglected loss of
sight, sometimes complete, ensued.
* * * *
“Dekko”: “Conda” (B. 30/6/’4B) asks
why small fishes swimming amidst the
tentacles of a Portuguese man-o’-war are
immune to their deadly stings. The
existence of any such “immunity” in the
light of the lowly structure of the animal
may be ruled out. Actually a colony of
highly specialised polyps, the tentacles are
inactive units of a drifting organism lack-
ing means of locomotion, and the capture
of food is a matter of chance. The stings
automatically react to a touch, and the
tentacles contract, so it can hardly be
credited that they could have any sense
of discrimination. More likely the active
fishes may well avoid contact with the
trailing tentacles, if merely as obstacles
to complete freedom of movement. In-
cidentally, small fishes are often noted
beneath the discs of some jellyfish. On
the Gredt Barrier Reef is found a parti-
cularly curious association of the tiny
fish Actinioola percula with a large sea-
anemone. On experimenting with the
latter I found the stings comparatively
harmless except to very small fry, whereas
some species, including one with tentacles
forming rosettes, can sting severely,
* * * *
“Aperist”: When “L. de F.” heard
those bees busily humming long after
proper knock-off time (B. 30/6/’4B) they
were engaged in making wax. For this
a hive-temperature higher than normal
is necessary, to attain which the wax-
makers join in dense clusters hanging
to the combs. This crowding generates
warmth, just as with animals. Before-
hand each bee has taken in a cropful of
honey. Now clustered, with gently fan-
ning wings, their bodies by some subtle
alchemy produce wax, which forms under
the minute scales of the abdomen. There
it remains for the moment, warm, soft,
plastic, ready to be wiped out by the
antennae when required for the building
of the combs.
* * * *
“Hanko”: When we were crossing the
wild Wonderwhere Ranges Lofty couldn’t
find a flat surface on which to stand his
newly-cooked damper, so he chocked the
thing as best he could with his
hat, but the floury disc flattened in his
Stetson and dashed off down a steep
slope. We gave chase, and then gave up.
Suddenly the long bloke pulled me into
a clump of wombat. “Look out,” ne
yelled. “The blankard’s cornin’ back.”
The damper dashed past and we took
up the chase and then a jerry to ourselves.
We reasoned that it would gradually lose
momentum charging between the oppos-.
ing slopes and eventually come to rest
in a gully. And it did just that, but the
thing was by then worn down to the size
of a two-bob bit and was hardly worth
while.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Ventriloquial birds (B.
19/5/’48)? Maoriland’s most skilful
practitioner is the shining cuckoo. Ac-
cording to that eminent authority Sir
Walter Buffer, the cuckoo utters eight or
nine notes of long, silvery sound. Though
the listener may be a few feet from the
bird the first note appears to come from a
distance, then each successive note draws
the sound nearer tiff it is heard being
emitted from the near-by cuckoo, which
then enters on an ecstasy of melody. The
long-tailed cuckoo is credited with the
same ventriloquial powers. Canaries also
demonstrate similar gifts. A Dunedin
man who once took charge of a canary
for a neighbor during his absence on holi-
day was mystified at hearing the bird’s
song being replied to by a mate in adja-
cent trees. Investigation revealed that it
was the canary pitching its voice afar.
Shifting the cage to another position was
attended with similar ventriloquial enter-
tainment from a different direction.
COUNTRY DIARY.
1. Childhood.
As a child I leaned down and gathered tokens
Of an unforgettable love not far from heaven
Where the wind Mew gum-scent over the casual
valley
And the inland sun struck glory into stone.
Warriors darker than shadows lithely stepped
Round the boulders long ago and left a legend
As they passed, which the hill has taken as its
own.
What is my love? The hollow tree with the
wind-voice
In its throat replies; “Gaunt hill, green valley;
rock
Of the rushing stream and blue-wren, little
lover;
Tree with the burning leaves and dew on web
Of the spider; sun on the flesh and earth in
the hand;
Bush-call, color, the golden- oak-flower, lone
cloud
Of the sky: these are his love, and the tokens
were dreams.”
2. The Bridge.
The wild vine grips the bridge-boards, ravelled
by sun
And wind into a labyrinth of whispers,
Like the years between —How far behind the
laughter
We knew, and the walks cross-country to those
remoter
And dearer places of the heart! Here again
Is the rough intimate fellow whose splinters
pricked
Our heels in those middle-winters and spurred
us over
The creek towards the mountains. Ours was
the blood
Of Leichhardt, murmuring for the unknown,
and we longed
To stand where the bunyas grew and hold the
sunset
In our arms; to cry exaltation to the world,
Caring not if the triumph consumed... What
dreams
Were these, never so strong to lead to death
Yet great enough never to be forgotten?
t
3. The Ploughman.
In clouded field he plods, under an autumn
Heaven, guiding his clumsy team and drawing
The furrow his father drew when the world
was young;
When day was the time to plant a challenge in
And watch it grow like a colored sail unfurling
In the wind, Halts the plough at the hillside
corner; -
The ploughman stands still in the sun, like a
sailor
Petrified with awe beside his tiller
As his eyes behold some new formidaMe thing
In his undulating seas. Man with a fire
In his soul, he burns against the years, and, body
Broken at last above his labor, will call
His son to the tiller, knowing that faith shall
give
The good voyage and promise of anchorage.
4. The Letter.
He will be whistling in the corn when you come,
An old English air, no doubt; a little out
Of tune, perhaps, but you remember how.
His hands are still as quick, his wrists as strong.
I cannot compete with him in picking corn.
There is something in his song that makes him
master
And he fills the cart in no time, deftly flinging
The cobs over his flannelled shoulder. And he’s
No older, nor less remarkable; you’ll love
Him more and join us in a labor of faith
Among these hills that lounge against the winds
Of amber evenings. Come back, dear friend,
O come!
The wild cotton is bursting on the slopes now.
Come home to him and the earth, whose son
you are.
QUEENSLAND.
DAVID IL ROWHOTHAM.


“Old-timer”: Cold? Listen! Big
Fleming and I were punching a mob of
wethers up the Mathoura-road from
Moama one July and it was so cold the
match-flame used to freeze before we
could get it to our pipes. What had us
worried was the blobs of frozen flame
we left on the stock-route as we threw
the matches away, and Big Fleming
reckoned that, come warm weather, they’d
defrost and set the grass alight. The
sheep were in full wool, but even then
they were so chilled that every time they
tried to bleat all you heard was a rattling
sound as their teeth chattered. Since
they were full-mouthed the effect of this
noise on the surrounding plains can be
imagined, their upper pads being as hard
as ice. Four miles out of Moama the
dogs turned it up and went back to the
hot rum and log-fire in the Border Inn,
and though Big Fleming and I tried to
hunt the wethers along it was no go, and
our chance of getting them across that
freezing plain wasn’t worth two bob. But
the initiative of the bushmen pulled us
through. Yair, we found old Jimmy
O’Brien camped beside a decent fire,
bought it off him for 10 bob and a second-
hand quart-pot, wired it together and
dragged it along the road in front of the
sheep. Shivering and chattering they ran
after it. Two days later, feeding it with
our last blanket, we led ’em into the yards
at Mathoura.
* * * *
“Moujik”: “G’snatcher’s” thumbnail
history of Baalbek (B. 30/6/’4B) is
correct —except that its mighty temples
were not built by Solomon, who died
round about 975 b.c., but by Antoninus
Pius, Emperor of Rome in the 2nd
century a.d. ; died a.d. 161. Also, the
70ft.-high columns were not erected to
the honor of Jupiter but to Bacchus. It
has been suggested that the site was
originally occupied
by a temple of Baal;
hence the name,
which means “place
of Baal.” But Baal
was long dead by the
time Antoninus de-
cided to do honor to
the then local deities,
Isis and Osiris, who,
being deities of love,
had become linked
with the jovial god of
wine, Bacchus. The
Levant at that time
was a fertile, thickly-
populated country,
hence the labor avail-
able. Further, Baal-
bek was not ever
occupied by the
Crusaders, but by
their opponent
Saladin, or Sal-a-din.
It also fell to
Genghis Khan, and
later still to Tamer-
lane. So it is pos-
sible to make a wide
guess as to who last defended it. Nor
was its first destruction brought about by
the iniquity of the priests of Baal, but
simply because tile armies incessantly
weaving to and fro between Europe and
Asia destroyed the forests, so changing
the climate that the vast population that
built and supported Baalbek vanished.
Finally it wasn’t called Baalbek by its
Roman builders, but the Temple of
Bacchus at Baalbek.
“Wippegong”; My old cobber Ben,
even more deeply addicted to bird-watch-
ing than I, has a secret sorrow. Ever
since his lad could toddle old Ben has
taken the young ’un across paddocks,
through scrub and along the river find-
ing nests, peeping at eggs, handling nest-
lings and generally leading him along the
desired path ; but the patient has reacted
wrongly to the injections, and now shows
strong symptoms of degenerating into a
passionate entomologist. He ignores tree-
creepers except to imitate them in search-
ing under bark for flat-bodied "spiders,
shows less, interest in ibis than in the
grasshoppers they destroy, and even sank
so low as to hurl a gibber at a scissors-
grinder hot on the heels of a brown
butterfly. But on one bleak night lately
salt was rubbed into the wound. Old
Ben turned in a bit early and could hear
the young scientist still poking about in
his room ; B. junior was recovering from
’flu and the parental voice promptly
ordered him to get back into bed and stay
there. The shuffler subsided ; then after
silence spake, “Dad, could you spare a
minute in here, please?” Ben stumped
in, growling, to be met with, “Dad, would
you mind opening the window and getting
that moth? He’s tap-tap-tapping to get
in—l have the other nine in here in a
box and he wants to be with them.”
* * * *
“Lower Tops’l”; Many Admiralty
charts have had a new look for longer
than a year (B. 30/6/ ’4B). Those made
by the R.A,N. of the New Guinea area
(and later beyond) as far back as 1943
had the land colored a brilliant yellow,
the sea blue, with the shallow spots
conveniently left white. Incidentally, the
R.A.N. survey branch was highly com-
mended by the R.N., the U.S.N.. and the
merchant skippers of all countries for
their chart work in Pacific waters —
kudos richly deserved, and which isn’t
generally known.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: South Aus-
tralia’s Minister for Agriculture, Sir
George Jenkins, was astounded to see
rabbits climbing trees while on a trip .to
the arid north-west of his State last
month. Many cottontails, he reports, are
climbing trees and scrubs to a height of
nine feet and barking them on the upper
branches. To realise the tree-climbing
and tree-living propensities of these
rodents one wants to witness the Murray
River overflowing its banks. In the
record 1931 flood at Tammit most lean-
ing box or small gums carried furred
residents. Rowing in the horse paddock
we observed several “pets” that lived for
a month in trees. Each day they went
further out the branches for leaves or
young bark, and in between feeds the
grass-eaters snored off in a fork after the
manner of a koala.
* * * * *
“The Pirate”: Darnley Island skin-
divers in Torres Strait —and they should
know —aver that the sting of the cobalt-
blue Portuguese men-o’-war (B. 30/6/’4B)
is effective in humans only if the bite
has been exposed to the air. So long as
the contacted part of the body is kept
under water and rubbed with the slime
of certain fish the pain, they say, is
slight. Most people, of course, don’t
realise they are stung until they come
out of the water.
* * * *
“M.U.R.”: A creature long familiar to
denizens of the Murray and its tribu-
“Hold you breath, Fat!”
taries appeared on a lagoon near Gunda-
gai (N.S.W.) and was promptly identi-
fied as a bunyip. Whereupon the usual
crackbrained locals careered forth bent
pn murder and sudden death. One of
them, described by a city paper as a
“crack rifle-shot,” fired six shots alto-
gether before he killed it. Brought from
the water it was nothing more harmful
than a lone musk duck. Places like Gun-
dagai are supposed to be educated com-
munities, with a love for the flora and
fauna of their country, but let anything
unusual appear and it promptly becomes
the target of some local “sportsman” or
other. Gundagai seems to be a worse
case than usual. Long established in song
and story as the home and haunt of bush-
men of the old school, it held a high
place in my esteem. Now, alas! by the
“Hope you don't mind me interrupting your obser-
vations, Professor, but I'm out of matches."
wanton hunting and killing of a harmless
bird it has fallen so low that in future
I’ll save my thirst for Tarcutta or Jugiong.
* * * *
“Shamuseen”: The Normanby River
(Q.) blacks had a simple explanation for
the crimson dewlap and the dancing
mania of the brolga. Originally it was
a prosaic grey-plumaged bird whose only
claim to remark was his great greed.
One day, indulging his insatiable appetite,
he scoffed the fruit of a shrub, which
somewhat resembles the imported “chilli.”
As an effect of the pungent repast the
bird’s features became chronically suf-
fused, and, in his discomfort, he broke
into the eccentric terpsichorean man-
oeuvres for which he is still famous.
* * * *
“Laetitia”: Probably “Creole’s” sea-
louse (B. 30/6/’4B) is identical with the
Torres Strait specimen, which runs to
half an inch in length. This para-
site has a special affinity for the shark,
to whose hide he adheres limpet-like. In
fact, he is rarely found detached from his
unwilling patron. Because of this associa-
tion Binghi knows him as “epi baidem,”
or “shark’s wife,” and harbors a super-
stitious belief that any injury done to a
detached sea-louse will render the per-
petrator liable to dire retribution at the
maws of the sea-tiger. Accordingly any
specimens which the islanders find
attached to their own persons are prised
off with extreme care and carefully re-
leased in the water. And who in the risky
game of skin-diving wouldn’t adopt such
a form of shark-insurance?
* * * *
“Billy T-”: lummy’s five hares with one
shot, as reported by “B. A. Ker” (B.
7/7/’4B), has a parallel even more con-
vincingly recorded. H.H. the Maharaja
of Narsinghgarh, Central India, bagged
six tigers with one shot in the same way ;
but he promptly had the taxidermists on
the job, and now the five cubs which
never saw daylight are “romping” in a
large glass-case that stands below heads
of cheetal and chinkara nilgai and sambur
and other such trophies. The coats of the
tiny striped kittens are indescribably silky,
and recall the days when the skins of un-
born calves were in demand for the
flashest waistcoats. The incident is re-
corded in detail in H.H.’s gamebook. I’ve
read the entry and handled the rifle used
—a magnificent d.b. 45. Incidentally, is
a litter of four usual among hares? I’ve
never found leverets in more than pairs.
* * * *
“Kendon”: Krakatoa’s eruption was
“the loudest noise ever recorded on
earth” (B. 23/6/’4B), but that description
hardly conveys a correct impression of
the enormity of the explosion. In this
case comparisons are futile. No explo-
sion generated by man could even faintly
echo the devastating roar that accom-
panied Krakatoa’s end. On July 16,
1945, a bomb, the first of its kind, was
exploded on top of a 100 ft. steel tower in
a New Mexico desert. The steel tower
was melted and a surging cloud was hurled
40,000 ft. into the air. Krakatoa’s erup-
tion shot an entire island 17 miles high
and originated waves that affected ship-
ping thousands of miles away in the
English Channel. Hell has few surprises
for the man who can visualise that tur-
moil.
#*■ * *
“Eastern”: When Mum was called
away for a lengthy period Dad took over
the running of the
vegetable - garden.
His letters sparkled
with enthusiasm and
success, so that when
Mum eventually re-
turned her first tour
of inspection in-
cluded the vegetable
patch. “B-but the
weeds, Dad,” she
gasped, pulling up at
the first plot to stare
in dismay at the
waving crop of
greenness. “Weeds?”
The old bloke looked
puzzled. “Y* don't
mean me perennial
rye? Gripes, Mum,
that’s the best
growth o' rye grass I
ever seen. Wish it’d
grow in the paddocks
like that. Come up
itself, too. An’ look
over here.” He led
her proudly to the
other ’ side of the
garden. “See that?”
he pointed. “Gripes,
I didn’t know clover
c’d grow so thick.
And that there’s a
patch o’ prairie-grass
that come up.” “Yes,
but the peas. Dad.
They’re smothered.”
“Peas?” The old
bloke rubbed his
chin reflectively.
“No, they don’t seem
to ’a’ done much
good this year, do they?” he murmured.
“Still, a man couldn’t pull up beautiful
grasses like them, just for a few lousy
vegetables.” *
* * * *
“Bybren”: “Woman’s work is never
done” (B. 30/6/’4B) reminds me that a
new baker is responsible for the Bybren
indigestion now. As his predecessor had
always given reasonable service, and there
was never more than 6in. of string to the
loaf, I sought the reason from my
spouse, “Oh, he was cheeky,” she re-
plied with that noncommittal air her sex
adopt when touched upon a sore point.
“In what way?” I persisted. “Well, if
you must know, I happened to mention
that a woman’s work is never done”
She faltered and bit her lip. “And what
did he say?” “He said” —and the tears
came with a rush —“It would be if they
stayed home and did it.” Honestly, I
never saw a woman cry so much.
* * * *
“Dusty Mile”; The pub at Laura (Q.)
is not unique (B. 16/6/’4B). I know a
few off the beaten track where real ser-
vice at a moderate srice is still con-
sidered the correct thing. The Hamilton
Hotel, op the Boulia road, nearly 200
miles from a railhead and scores of
miles from the nearest township, has a
coffee-room, refrigeration and electric
light. Even remoter is the little baked-
mud hotel at the junction of the Mayne
and Diamantina Rivers. It is at least 160
miles from the nearest township, and its
amenities surpass many city hotels. A
wide warm smile assures the traveller
that the real Australia has not yet died,
even though he has had to come a long
way to discover it.
* * * *
'“Mat’s Mate”: The Jeparit land-agent
told us of a job on the Kenmare Road.
“But,” said he, “the bloke’ll want ref-
erences. No good goin’ if y’ haven’t got
any.” We never bothered with them,
since we considered written references
were mostly lies, but we needed that job
and made for it. “You come after the
job?” the boss, asked. “Yair,” Mat
replied. “Have y’ any references an’ why
did y’r last men leave y’?” The boss
gaped, recovered, and blurted, “What-
inell’s that got t’ do with it?” “A lot,”
Mat answered. “We don’t work for
anybody unless he’s got a good name, an’
if the last blokes y’ had left they must ha’
had a good reason; if y’ sacked ’em
either them or you was at fault.” The
boss reflected, watching Mat closely.
Then he said, “Look, I’ll give y’ a job
on one condition. That y’ don’t start
any arguments with me, see? Gripes, a
man wouldn’t be in the hunt with you.”
Then he looked at me and said, “An’
what have you got t’ say for y’self?”
“Don’t pick on me,” I said ; “you only
got to employ him; I got t’ camp an’
work with him an’ everythin’.” “Righto,”
he said. “I’ll start y’ both in the mor-
nin’.” He looked at Mat and then at me
and, as he turned away, I just caught his
murpaured “Poor blankard! ”
THE SHAFTS.
Where men once mined, their faith their driving
master,
Their labor written in the mullock heap,
The shafts today are foul of air and creeping:
Black holes that stare for ever, stark and
deep.
There’s moss about * their sides, and
showing,
Dark, stagnant pools below all rank with
slime;
And hollow sounds that down below go
rumbling,
Deep down within the darkness of all time.
They mark the hills and gullies and the
mountains:
The milestones of the men who’ve gone-
before :
The tombstones of the dreams of men who
sank them,
The churchyard of the faith the dreamers
bore.
“I think we’ll strike the reef again at fifty!”
“We’re down another forty feet or soT”
Hark to the echoes of the long-dead voices!
Hear you the hopes that lived there long
ago?
Old shafts that lie far-scattered on earth’s
surface;
Old shafts abandoned now to earth’s
decay ;..
See you a man still straining at the windlass?
See you the scene of long-dead yesterday?
Down, down, the dark deep shafts are ever
sleeping;
Down, down, the tunnels run where men
sought gold;
And high above, pressed to the earth in sun-
light,
The groundlark builds her nest in sunny fold.

THE WAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Menace of Scabby-mouth.
“Murrawong”: Indications
are that it will be more prevalent
than for many years. Outbreaks
have already occurred in widely
separated areas, both in lambs
and grown sheep free from con-
tact with lambs. Scabby-mouth
(contagious pustular dermatitis)
is caused by a wog that enters
through a break in the skin
caused by grazing among thistles
or even by medium of scalded
lips through grazing on frosted
grass. Blisters break and form
scabs that spread rapidly over
lips and nostrils. The disease is
highly infectious. Lambs infect
the udders of the ewes, which
are frequently damaged beyond
hope of recovery, and the ewes
suffer the infection on lips and
legs.
Direct consequence is a check
to the lamb from which it may
never recover. Grazing, or feed-
ing from the udder, is so painful
that the lamb loses condition
rapidly. It may be deserted by
the ewe. Mortality may be sub-
stantial. Indirect consequences
represent even greater loss.
Shearers will not handle scabby-
mouthed sheep. The award con-
dones their refusal, but the
majority go much farther and'
won’t shear any part of a mob
in which one single case or sus-
pect is found.
Already in N.S.W. shearing
teams are pulling out and leaving
flocks unshorn because one or
two cases of scabby-mouth have
been detected. Shearing labor is
scarcer than ever. The shortage
has not been relieved by the
generous increase in shearing
rates; there is still far more
money in rabbits, where a man
is his own boss and can easily
evade payment of wages tax.
Many of the best types of
shearer have permanent jobs in
the cities, and have given up all
thoughts of toiling on the end
of a tube. Wet weather has re-
sulted in delays, planned runs
are far behind schedule and men
are not forthcoming to make up
relief teams.
Sheepmen can’t control
weather, but they can avoid
trouble by vaccinating lambs and
young sheep before shearing. A
prudent man will treat all his
lambs every year, and thus build
up a flock immune to scabby-
mouth. It takes 10-14 days after
vaccination to get full protection,
so the futility of waiting until the
disease appears must be evident.
One treatment gives the animal
life immunity.
Cost of the vaccine is low—
about Id. for five sheep. Vac-
cinating outfits will each treat
about 400 lambs and comprise
two small bottles. One, contain-
ing powder which is actually the
live virus of the disease, is
emptied into the larger bottle of
clear fluid and shaken up well
just before use. The virus must
be kept in a refrigerator or at a
very low temperature. In view
of this and of the necessity to
use it within three months of
manufacture it is inadvisable to
carry stocks.
Commonwealth Serum Labor-
atories do not supply needles.
Grind the blunt end off a stout
darning needle, leaving the two
arms of the eye with a sharp
point or edge on each. Stick
the sharp end of the needle into
a 3in. length of light dowelling
or a cut-down penholder. By
vaccinating at marking, extra
mustering and handling are re-
duced to a minimum, but it is
imperative that at least a fort-
night elapse between vaccination
and shearing. If lambs are oe-
ing inoculated for pulpy kidney,
one operator can do both jobs;
inject the pulpy-kidney vaccine
in one hindleg and on the bare
patch inside the opposite thigh
apply the scabby-mouth vaccine.
With an auger bore a hole in
the top of a convenient post or
rail to hold the bottle of S-M.
vaccine. Dip the needle into the
vaccine so that a drop will be
retained between the arms of the
eye, then scratch the skin of the
lamb. To be on the safe side,
dip again and make a second
scratch either parallel to or across
the first. It is not necessary to
draw blood, and the skin must
not be cleaned with iodine or
methylated spirits, etc. If the
vaccination takes, a scab will
form which may cause tem-
porary lameness. Don’t vac-
cinate an animal already in-
fected. Order requirements well
ahead and make a regular habit
of vaccination.
Pig-meal Production.
“N.H.”: In Queensland it is
steadily increasing and will get
an enormous fillip from the
British Food Mission’s grain-
sorghum production scheme in
C.Q. There will be a wide de-
mand for good boars and sows.
New Guinea pigmen are in the
market for good breeding stock.
Rehabilitation of the Danish
bacon industry is the only ele-
ment which could seriously cut
into the Australian supply. But
Denmark is a long way from
reaching that stage. Canada
mainly eased the bacon shortage
in the U.K. when the war ousted
Denmark, but Canadian exports
are steadily declining because of
largely increased home consump-
tion. Australia and New
Zealand look to be the logical
suppliers to the U.K. for a long
time to come.
There is a sound return for
the dairyfarmer who increases
his pig numbers, more particu-
larly if he grows his own feed or
most of it. But haphazard breed-
ing won’t do. Boars and sows of
stock which can show good pro-
duction results, particularly those
which have produced pigs of
right type for bacon carcasses,
must be star-boarders on the
farms. The English market
wants quality (it took 450,000
tons of pig-meats before the
war), and the Australian product
must be of a class to compete
with its rivals.
Up to now Australian • pig
production has been largely con-
trolled by the price of grain and
its availability. The British
Food Mission’s C.Q. grain-
sorghum planting should help.
In the past 30 years, except in
Queensland, pig population
showed little permanent advance.
Queensland production today is
on the heels of N.S.W. and is
well ahead of Victorian figures.
Feeding the Horse.
“Sarina”: Working horses, no
matter how well fed, need good
night grazing in order to keep
their condition. If possible, the
paddock should be above winter
frosts, which soon spoil many
grasses, besides being so situated
that there is no chance of the
nags being trapped against a
fence by an unexpected fire in
summer. If the paddock adjoins
a crop paddock, the separating
fence should be well strained
with sound barbed-wire.
Native grasses are all right in
districts where the rainfall is well
distributed over the year, but
they provide very little nutriment
during a cold, dry winter. Pas-
palum dilatatum is an excellent
horse grass; it is very nutritious
and will stay green all the year
on Queensland’s blacksoil flats.
Couch grass is very hardy and
will grow on both light and
heavy soils. Buffalo - couch
makes a splendid sward pasture
most of the year in mild districts,
but it is badly knocked about by
a hot, rainless spring.
Of the taller grasses, Guinea
is superior to all others for
north-central Queensland con-
ditions. It is temporarily killed
by frost, but even the dry stuff
is good feed. No matter how
serious the drought, it is un-
usual to see Guinea grass really
dried up. Elephant grass is also
drought-resistant and provides
the very best of feed, but is not
such a free spreader as Guinea
grass.
Electric Fences.
“Outback”; Graziers in the
Stonehenge district, south of
Longreach, have found electric
fences such a good barrier
against the dingo that they are
seeking to have the cost of erec-
tion and maintenance of such
fences made an allowable deduc-
tion for income-tax purposes. If
materials and labor were avail-
able electric fences in dog-
infested country would give a
measure of control until such
time as ordinary dogproof
fencies can be constructed. The
consensus of opinion among
graziers and departmental
officials is that dogproof fences
make the only dingo-control mea-
sure which will eventually eradi-
cate wild dogs, and the Queens-
land Government plans to spend
“Keep still or I'll cut your jugular !”
thousands on their erection. But
until this work can be done
something more than the em-
ployment of doggers and the
payment of a bonus on scalps is
required.
Plans—and Supplies.
“Agric”: In view of the
desperate shortage of meatmeal
in Queensland today, pig- and
poultry-raisers are alarmed re-
garding the possible meatmeal
position when the Queensland-
British Food Corporation’s pig-
raising scheme gets under way.
Queensland today produces
about 4000 tons of meatmeal
per annum, which is sufficient to
meet only one-third of current
requirements. The corporation
aims to run about 500,000 pigs,
which will require 19,250 tons
of meatmeal, based on feeding
ilb. meal per day to baconer
pigs and daily to brood
sows. Even if 50 per cent, of
their protein requirements was
made up by feeding vegetable
protein, such as peanut- and
sunflower-meal, they would still
require 10,000 tons of meat-
meal annually. It is possible,
of course, that the Canberra and
London planners have devised a
special formula for the supply
of proteins' to grain-fed pigs,
formularies being well to the
fore today, but it looks as
though there will shortly be an
increased demand for headache
powders.
Planting a Hedge.
“Sundowner”: Late spring is
the best time for planting an
evergreen hedge, but the bed
should be prepared now. Double-
trench the soil and incorporate
a humus of decayed farm
manure and blood and bone or
bonedust. Plant during reason-
ably dry conditions and allow
Ift. to sft. between plants accord-
ing to type used. If in an ex-
posed situation staking will be
worth while. Hoe and water
frequently during summer and
apply a mulch of decayed dung
or leaf-mould.
Don’t prune during the first
season. With the exception of
conifers most
plants should be
cut back hard the
following spring.
Top conifers when
within Ift. to 2ft.
of required height.
Hard cutting in the
early stages encour-
ages multiple basal
branching which is
most essential to
furnish a healthy
and well - clothed
base. Walls should
slope slightly in-
wards to afford
plenty of light and
air to maintain the
base in a dense and
healthy condition.
A late - summer
trim is often necessary with ever-
greens and conifers. Flowering
varieties should be cut immedi-
ately after flowering, except
where they form attractive
berries, when clipping may be
delayed until late in winter.
Japanese Millet.
“Mr.*’: It’s nice to have a
paddock or two showing green
as late-spring and early-summer
pastures go off. Jap millet has
bulk, is nutritious and recovers
well after cutting and grazing,
and will grow reasonably well
over a wide range of soils. Be-
ing rather shallow-rooted, it’s
not particularly drought-resistant
and needs a well-prepared seed-
bed with some summer rain or
irrigation.
Allow it to be well established
before feeding off, and then
make the grazing rapid and
clean. This encourages, stooling
and won’t punish the plants as

much as extended grazing and
trampling. After the stock come
off, harrow the stand and irri-
gate it. When required for feed-
ing out to stock or as silage,
mow before the millet seeds and
take it off at least Sin. above-
ground to encourage further
growth. For hay, defer cutting
until the seed-head forms, but
don’t leave it beyond that stage
or the quality will deteriorate
rapidly.
The seeding rate varies be-
tween 61b. per acre in dry dis-
tricts to 151 b. in the wet or irri-
gated areas, the average being
101 b. to 12 lb. in a seed-bed V 2 -m.
deep. Monthly sowings from
September to January for con-
tinuous green feed.
Branding Bales.
“Green Ink”: The correct side
is the one with the seam running
around it, not “the seamless
side” (B. 26/5/’4B). The reason
is that on the show-floor, bales
are stood on end, as close to-
gether as possible, brands facing
outwards, two rows back to
back. Every fourth bale
usually is placed upside-down.
These are opened along the seam
about a foot at the top corner
by cutting the stitches. After
buyer’s inspection they are sewn
up neatly at the seam. Branding
the other side would mean the
bale would be cut across the
material, and when resewn
would be a damaged and weak-
ened bale. When they encounter
bales wrongly branded brokers
put them in the rows right-side
out, and, as the brand is then
hidden, chalk the brand on the
front.
* Hints for the Farm.
“Bill C.”; An efficient self-
feeder for pigs is made out of
a 44gal. oil-drum mounted on
a concrete cone, itself set on a
square concrete platform. Three
posts are sunk into the con-
crete, both ends are knocked
out of the drum and the latter
is placed over the cone and
securely bolted to the posts. The
grain flows out of the cone on
to the concrete floor as the pigs
feed.
“Sarina”: Bare, scalded or
stony parts need not spoil pas-
toral grasslands in N.Q. (B.
16/6/’4B), for Townsville lucerne
may be established there from
seed. It is an annual legume
with a growing season lasting
from spring until late autumn.
Stock do not eat it much when
green, but are fond of it when
winter cold has dried it up. Its
crude protein at the dry stage is
over 13 per cent.
“Hoa”; Trees will grow in
half the usual time if given a
couple of ounces of super, every
few years. The first helping
should be given at time of plant-
ing, and successive ones put
close to the trunk when growth
appears to be slackening. Coni-
fers require super., which can
be placed in drains between the
rows of seedlings in early years
of growth if water is available.
“M.”: To get the cockchafer
grub from a lawn, mix 51b. of
lead arsenate with a bushel of
moist, screened soil and spread
over the grass thinly and evenly.
This is sufficient to treat 1000
square feet. Lightly hose to
water the poison in.
“Sundowner”; Best remedy
for a zinc deficiency of fruit-
trees, noticeable in some Vic-
torian districts this year, is a
winter zinc-sulphate spray of
501 b. of zinc sulphate to 100
gallons of water. Best period is
either just before or two or
three weeks after pruning.
“Billjim”: Besides being a
valuable soil-binder in wind-
swept Mallee areas, ryecorn pro-
vides a great bulk of nutritions
green leafage which aids in the
prevention of pregnancy
toxaemia in ewes.
“M.A.T.”; Make sure that
your wireless is firmly closed
against small creatures. Ours
burst into flames when a large
cockroach flew into the back and
started a short circuit, and a
neighbor’s went up when a frog
made a “short.”
“Ben Acre”: Water can be
strained from petrol by pouring
it through a cloth or fine gauze
that has been dipped in petrol.
Oil and kerosene can be strained
in the same way,
“Kimat”: It is surprising that
artificially-reared chicks who
have never known a mother be-
come good mothers themselves.
My broody, one of six from the
incubator, was the most devoted
mother, breaking up the grain
before passing it to the chicks,
teaching them to scratch, shep-
herding them from the sun, see-
ing that her young were well
grounded in all the crafts she
had had to learn for herself.
But there was one art she and
her companions had never learnt
in their parentless youth and
could not pass on—the jubilant
cackling that normally accom-
panies the laying of an egg. The
artificially-reared generation de-
posited their eggs in silence.
Was it because they never heard
the sound as chicks?

□ t
The introduction of the
Forward Moving Grate,
discharging ash continu-
ously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
1. Combustion conditions
are not disturbed by inter-
mittent ash removal.
2. There is no clinker for-
mation, even with ash
having very low fusion tem-
perature, as the bulk of the
air required for combustion
passes through and cools
the ash layer, thereby
avoiding harmful deposits
on the pressure parts.
3. Automatic control is
simply applied.
4. High burning rates are
readily attained, as the fuel
and the air are evenly dis-
tributed over every square
foot of grate area.
Whatever your steam requirements may be, and whatever fuel you
may use, you can rely upon Babcock & Ltd. for advice,
which will be given without bias. As manufacturers of chain grate,

“I am one of those fortunate wives
who know to a penny how much my
husband earns and how much insur-
ance he carries.” —“New Idea.”
Does he run a harem?
A Good Time Wasn’t Had.
“The latest idea for parties is that
the hostess and her family act with
a ‘Take-us-as-you-find-us’ attitude.”
It was the first party of its
kind in our suburb, and as the c
hostess opened the door to us
the curlers on her head rattled
and her face grew pale. After
pausing in thought for a moment
she smiled and welcomed us
with “Blast you, I haven’t a
thing in the place!” We found
her husband filing the serial
numbers off a neighbor’s lawn-
mower, the dog and baby were
fighting over a chop-bone and
grandfather, who was sticking
pin-up girls in an album when
we met him, called repeatedly
throughout the afternoon:
“Haven’t those blankards gone
yet?”
But the finest interpretation
of the take-us-as-you-find-us
idea was given by the family’s
maiden aunt, who tripped out of
the bathroom with a towel
around her middle and a cigar
in her mouth. After a glass of
water all round we prepared to
depart, voting that the hostess
had launched the scheme with
startling success. She beamed
and remarked that she had
really tried to make it so, but
had found surprising difficulty
in forcing herself and her family
to forget propriety and play the
parts they did. We applauded
her warmly. Then grandfather
showed up and bellowed:
“Effie, didn’t you tell me these
goats were coming next week?”

“Mr. Chifley arrived at Gatow airport,
Berlin, at noon, and left at 7.35 p.m.
for London. But in those eight hours
he observed more than most others would
see in eight weeks. He spent some
time with German unionists, whom he
praised.” —Cable blurb.
Boneless Ben, the Bathurst
Wonder, had been broadening
that mind of his.
Five minutes after the plane
touched-down at Berlin he was
closeted with Herr Haffschi-
kerdt, chairman of the Tempel-
hof Labor League. After diplo-
matically promising that his cele-
brated colleague the Herr Dok-
tor Evatt would, as acknow-
ledged champion of the small
nations, be delighted to take
Germany under his wing when
it was at last admitted to the
United Nations, Ben asked if
full employment had been
achieved in Germany as it had
in Australia.
“Nein, Herr Chifley,” said
Herr Haffschikerdt sadly. “Un-
vortunately ve der great number
of vorkless haff, ain’t it.”
“But surely,” commented
Boneless, “your officials, with
“If’s better than a suitcase for getting through crowds !”
the permission of the Allied
Control Council, could start
some boards! There is, so lam
told, plenty of rubble .still in
Berlin from the Allied bombing.
Why not start a Rubble Board?
You commence with a chair-
man, a typist and an office-boy,
and within three months there
will be a staff of at least five
hundred. They won’t da any-
thing, of course, but at least
they are employed, and when'
you set up a Labor Government
here after the Allies have handed
control of affairs back to you—
well, won’t all the people
‘temporarily’ employed on all the
boardsi vote Labor to keep them-
selves in jobs? We’ve done
that for years in Australia. Soon
we hope to have more than half
the population in boards and
Government departments, then
we’ll never be out of office. Be-
sides, we’ve found that by ap-
pointing boards for this and that
they run the country, which
saves us politicians quite a lot
of time which we can devote to
thinking what further boards we
can establish.”
“But iff der beoble are doing
noddings bud villing in vorms
vod aboud brodugtion?” asked
Herr Haffschikerdt.
Ben looked at his host pity-
ingly. “You don’t seem to grasp
the fundamentals of socialistic
economy as us Labor statesman
do,” he said. “The fewer people
we have in our factories the
greater the output —at least in
theory. You see, there is less
crowding at the benches, which
puts the worker in such a happy
state of mind that he works like
mad —or so we hope —thus re-
sulting in a flood of consumer
goods being turned out. Just as
when we reduced hours from
forty-four to forty production
rose immediately—or at least it
would have had it not been for
the inefficiency of the grasping
employers. You see, the workers
were so gratified at having four
hours more each week to spend in
the pubs that they now can’t get
to work in the morning quickly
enough, and they whale in to
such an extent that we are
almost embarrassed by the tre-
mendous increase in output. We
hope to give our workers even
greater leisure, but not until we
have more dog- and horse-rac-
ing courses available for the
mid-week racing which will be
Labor’s contribution to the great
cultural needs of the workers.
Now that is proper socialistic
planning, and”
“But ve haff heard,” put in
Herr Haffschikerdt, “that der
beoble in Australia gannot buy
goal or goke, matches or sugar
or”
“Now if you’ll excuse me I
must go!” interrupted the Bone-
less Wonder hurriedly. “I must
examine in detail the many
complexities of the Allied prob-
lem here.” And he shot through.
A few minutes later he was at

yes, it was the Railwaymen’s
Union greeted him as a
brother. For an hour they dis-
coursed on such vital topics as
the procedure of proxy voting
in the union and its representa-
tion in the Socialist party. Only
once did the secretary, Herr
Skwarehedt, express surprise,
and that was when his distin-
guished guest, discussing the
ethics of his old calling, con-
tended that no real railwayman
would be worthy of the name
unless he was prepared, in the
interests of working-class soli-
darity, not only to go on strike
when his country was in the
middle of a death-struggle for
existence but to abandon his
train miles from anywhere.
Off again on his tour to grasp
fully the complexities of the Ber-
lin problem and its impact on
world affairs, Ben dashed to the
Trades and Labor Council to
discuss with officials the world-
shattering problem of whether
apprentices should be entitled to
vote in appdinting shop-stewards
in unions ; thence he tore around
to the Union Secretaries’ Union,
the Berlin Council of Trades
Unions and the headquarters of
the Social Democrat party to
give them a' few hints on how
to nationalise Germany’s banks
at a later date. Then someone
pointed out to him the leader of
the German Communist party.
At sight of the Kremlin’s agent,
who was being ordered off the

turned a sickly green around the
gills. After he had stopped
shaking he said to the chairman
of the party in an awed whisper ;
“You want to be more careful.
He’s a powerful man. We
wouldn’t dare do that in our
country!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

The Seventh State
The next five years should see New
England take its place as a seventh State
of the Commonwealth, At Armidale
(N.S.W.) 100 practical delegates from 40
north and north-western local-governing
areas were not only unanimously in favor
of creating a new political unit but took
steps to bring it about. A provisional
executive committee was formed to
organise a New-State campaign, and
money was enthusiastically subscribed.
The enthusiasm, conspicuously absent
from earlier conferences, was the key-
note of the convention.
Enthusiasm, however, should not blind
the New State’s organisers to the pitfalls
ahead of them. The most dangerous is
the tendency to try to bring too large an
area under the new Government. This
is a common mistake of very young pro-
vinces—Victoria, Queensland and South
Australia were all guilty of it in their early
days. And at Armidale one delegate
urged that the Hunter Valley and New-
castle be included in the seceding area.
That would amount to no more than a
mere change of masters, for the Coal City
would speedily take Sydney’s place. Syd-
ney control has been bad, but that of
Newcastle would be worse. It is a strong-
hold of a brand of politics inimical to
country interests. It bitterly opposed the
North Coast Deep-sea Port Scheme.
With its Communist-tainted section in a
population of 130,000, and a similar
population in such near-by satellites as
Maitland and Cessnock, it could dominate
the new State indefinitely. The coalies
and wharfies of Newcastle district have
nothing in common with the farmers and
graziers further north.
In any case, the Hunter valley is no
part, geographically, of the future
northern province, whose boundaries have
been fairly clearly drawn by nature. To
the east, there is the Pacific ; to the north,
the Queensland border; to the west, the
Barwon and Castlereagh Rivers; to the
south, the Warrumbungles, the arc of the
Liverpool Range, and the courses of the
Barnard and the Manning. These borders
enclose a compact, fertile, well-watered
area with a well-distributed, industrious
population, for the most part engaged in
agriculture or stock-raising. Industries
are growing, and education up to uni-
versity standard Is on a sound basis.
Thus there are all the conditions neces-
sary to a flourishing and well-balanced
economy.
There is no sign of centralisation. With
the population around the half-million
mark, only three towns have more than
10,000 people—Tam worth, Grafton and
Lismore. Lismore, the biggest, has 17,000
—approximately three per cent, of the
total. Queensland and Tasmania, the least
centralised States, both have more than 25
per cent, of their people in their capital
cities.
The absence of any overwhelmingly
large town need not, as has been pre-
dicted, cause any great difficulty in select-
ing the capital. The main requirement is
accessibility, so that a site on the New
England Tableland, readily reached from
coast and plains, would be most suit-
able. From this, as from most other
points of view, Armidale itself appears to
be the logical choice. In addition to its
central position, it is a cathedral city and
a university town. It is a noted educa-
tional centre, and no other town in the
area has so good a claim to the seat of
government.
Once established, the Seventh State’s
future should be bright. Its foundation
entails no revolution, but merely the con-
tinuation of the natural political process
begun many years ago when Victoria and
Queensland were separated from the
parent colony.—K. A, S, (N.S.W.)
Decentralisation
The plans of New-State advocates are
only a very passive attempt to achieve
greater prosperity for country areas. Re-
organisation should begin in the areas
concerned.
In northern N. S. Wales residents and
local-government bodies could alleviate
at least some of the evilsi of centralisa-
tion. The drabness of provincial towns
often indicates a lack of interest in any-
thing except beer and betting. Simple
beautification schemes, modern civic
centres, libraries and so forth would work
wonders. True, such things cost money,
but generally it is energy rather than
funds which isi needed.
Industry could be encouraged by offers
of land at reasonable prices. Already one
factory is being built at Coffs Harbor
(N.S.W.) because the power supply is
more certain than in Sydney. It is up to
the rural bodies to convince manufac-
turers of the benefits of their districts.
Decentralisation has been effected to
some extent in Queensland. Lands Titles
Office, Stamp Duties Office and Supreme
Courts function successfully in Rock-
hampton and Townsville. Rail services
cater for short trips to and from country
cities. That is in marked contrast to
N. S. Wales, where every train route ends
at Central. True, there is a move for a
new State in north Queensland, but it is
directed against Canberra rather than
Brisbane.
The main reason for the better set-up
in the north is the independent spirit of
the people—-an awareness of their own
importance and their refusal to be tied
to Brisbane. Politicians quickly realised
this and planned their administration ac-
“Pardon me, Mrs. Smith; your husband's been moved to Ward nine!"
cordingly. Now practical measures are
in hand for regional development all over
Queensland.
Armidale (N.S.W.) New Staters would
do well to work from the inside instead
of waiting for their political severance
from N.S.W. Remote Government con-
trol has its faults, but a larger unit can
better withstand droughts, floods and
other disasters —if one district is suffer-
ing badly there is always a chance of
compensating prosperity in another part
of the State.
What isi needed is constructive work
in country areas to improve living con-
ditions and cultural amenities and to
attract secondary industries. Co-opera-
tion between districts —this has been lack-
ing—must replace the petty parochial out-
look of local-government bodies. Once
industries are established Sydney poli-
ticians will be forced to follow the
Queensland example.
An honest effort along those lines will
do more for the cause of decentralisation
than destructive criticism of Sydney ad-
ininistration. — Coffsite (N.S.W.).
War Damage Insurance
In Queensland, which was more or less
a garrison State during the war, property-
owners took out more than the 10s.
minimum war-damage insurance.
The anticipated £10,000,000 surplus in
the fund should not be dropped into
consolidated revenue or into the loan
fund; it should be distributed to shire
and municipal councils in areas where
defence activity was heavy to relieve
property-owners of the costs of recon-
structing roads which were worn out
by Army traffic. When councils put in
claims for compensation the Defence
authorities were niggardly, payments in
many instances being only enough to
grade dirt on to short sections of road-
way. Most councils have had to borrow
heavily to remake roads.
The insurance fund rightly belongs to
the property-owners. Good roads are as
essential to increased production as any-
thing else.
Reports also indicate that between
£10,000,000 and £15,000,000 from the
petrol tax will go into consolidated
revenue. Since the Treasurer has mil-
lions in “reserves:’ the. petrol-tax money
should be added to the roads grants to
the States. Twenty millions handed over
to the States and to local-governing
bodies would ease the drain on the loan
fund and would save property-owners
extra rating. The Valuer-General’s De-
partment has recently valued some
Queensland areas, and valuation increases
have run from 90 per cent, on small
areas to 50 and 60 per cent, on rural
lands, with urban lands in small town-
ships up prodigiously— What About It
(Q-).
Dollars and Petrol
Being cursed with an inadequate petrol
ration myself I can sympathise with
“Country Chemist’ 7 (B. 9/6/’4B), but then
I live in a dollar-producing area and he
doesn’t. Chifley, who passed through
here, may persuade Attlee to take less
food so that Australia may get more
petrol, but I doubt it. Australians seem
unable to realise that the world is short
of both oil and tankers and most of it
lacks dollars, so there’s little point in
“C.C.” blaming the politicians. They
do themselves well, but the amount of
petrol they use is trifling compared with
the amount which is just wasted.
If “C.C.” reads his Bulletin he can
see many examples of waste. In West-
ralia they’ve let their railways decay to
the stage where, instead of the wheat
harvest being carried at the cost of a few
hundred tons of Collie coal, they’ve had
to use three-ton trucks at a cost of thou-
sands of gallons of petrol. In Queens-
land, somebody is rejoicing because, in-
stead of using the hated but nonetheless
coal-burning State railway, they’ve shifted
25,000 head of sheep by motor at a cost
of more thousands of gallons.
On inter-city routes like Sydney-Mel-
bourne and Sydney-Brisbane there are
coal-burning trains competing with oil-
burning ships, planes, trucks, buses and
private cars. The aeroplane is used not as a
luxurious method of travel for those who
can afford to pay for it, but subsidised
to bring it within the reach of everybody.
In fact, the whole national economy is
based on the free use of imported oil. The
time is approaching when even Australia
may have to cut its coat to the available
cloth. — Transporticus (Singapore).
Foley Goes North
Innisfail (N.Q.), a place wherein the
summer visitor may be drowned in
oceans of rain and the winter visitor kid-
napped and pressed into work on the
adjoining sugarcane farms, got itself
talked at the other week by Mr. Foley,
the State Minister for Mines, who seemed
to think that not only was N.Q. a
veritable El Dorado but there was about
to burst upon it a fabulous era beside
which Mr. Chifley’s Golden Age was as
cold and dark as a Sydney kitchen dur-
ing a gas strike.
Premising that “prospectors and
gougers” had taken most of the mineral
wealth from the surface, and that hence-
forth “big capital” must now dig deep
for the stuff, and entirely unconscious of
the heresy of a Labor Minister using
such terms, Mr. Foley let himself go:
Fifteen large companies were using aerial
photography, geophysics, drilling, etc., in
search of oil, copper, gold, coal and other
valuables. His Government had an irri-
gation “programme” extending from the
border streams of the south-west to the
Nogoa, the Burdekin, the Walsh and the
Barron. Dam-sites were being sought on
the Walsh and the Barron; water from the
Barron could be gravitated to Mareeba and
Dimbulah and—in fioodtime —to the Walsh.
His Government had spent £3l million in
reafforestation and would spend more,
since there was now only five years’ supply
of pine available. The Bureau of Industry
was “constantly in touch with those in-
terested in establishing secondary indus-
tries.” Powell, Duffryn experts had looked
upon the Moreton coal deposits and said
coal production could he doubled. Test-
drills were driving into other coal areas.
He expected Blair Athol to produce 3£
million tons a year, and its electric trains
would haul 800 to 1000 tons a trip to the
coast. The agreement with the British
Food Mission meant unheard-of develop-
ments in land production.
After which Innisfail dutifully ap-
plauded and, a little uncertain as to
whether or no Mr. Foley should be cap-
tured and sent to cut cane, went home
or round to the pub and thought hard.
And presently it dawned upon them that
Mr. Foley must have had some reason
for his outburst, whereupon they recalled
that around Cairns, Innisfail, Townsville
and Ingham there was great talk of a
plan to nominate for the next Federal
and State elections only North Queens-
land candidates sworn to work for a new
North Queensland State, and who would
contest every seat north of Mackay. And,
grinning wryly at the speed with which
information of these doings had reached
Queen-street, they went to bed, their new-
State dreams undiminished by the words
of Mr. Foley.—C. S. (Q.).
Drift to the Cities
The last census revealed population in-
creases in all States, though with some
States it was the city only which bene-
fited, rural populations having declined.
But, in keeping with the times, farming
today is streamlined, machines supplanting
human, horse and bullock labor. Where
once four teams of horses and a driver
for each were needed to plough a wheat-
field, one man operating both tractor and
plough do the job. There is a similar
saving of time and labor in harvesting.
Where bullock-teams once labored for
days Fringing the clip to the railhead
trucks and trailers now shift the wool in
as many hours. For every heavy truck
employed on the roads a teamster or two
is done away with.
On large holdings, boundary-riders use
old station cars to look after more and
larger paddocks than they could with a
horse.
Dairyfarmers have replaced milkmaids
with machines, and even market-gar-
deners use power-driven rotary-hoes to
cultivate between the cabbage rows.
Manual workers are not wanted, except
to tend these tireless workers.—C. A. L.
(W.A.).
Root of the Matter
I’ve lately had personal experience of
the prevalent itinerancy of employees
mentioned by “K.M.C.” (B. 16/6/’4B).
About three months ago the breadcarter
who had served us for for five years went
to another firm. Five men have since
filled the post. Some lasted only a week,
the present holder being the only one to
exceed a fortnight. The firm, an old-
established one, used to keep its workers
for years. All the new men have been
young and unmarried. Their policy,
apparently, is to try a job for a week or
two, then tackle something else, probably
after a few days’ holiday.—A. L. D.
(N.S.W.).
From the “Railway Advocate,” pub-
lished in Sydney by the National Union
of Railwaymen and read in Tasmania
by members of the branch:
We have been informed that the Com-
munist-controlled shop-committee Council
has arranged for railway employees to strike
in July. All decent, intelligent railwaymen
will reject any such proposal without hesi-
tation. Our conciliation and arbitration
legislation is entirely sufficient to meet the
requirements of all law-abiding citizens:
and is always available.
N.U.R. members will certainly disregard
any coaxing by agents of foreign Powers
to act as traitors to their country.
Australia needs! more unions like the
N.U.R. —S. U. (Tas.).
The Potato Board is only one of a mul-
titude functioning in Adelaide. At
present the law is that potatoes may not
be sold before inspection, but, having
had some bad “murphies” foisted on
me, I went to the markets to investigate.
The grower drives to the inspector’s
office, but from a load of anything
up to a hundred bags only two are ex-
amined. The taxpayer, of course, pays
for the service.—A. D. (S.A.).
Recommending compulsory military
training to the “Government,” and re-
calling that it had been R.S.L. policy for
30 years, the Rockhampton branch of the
League got an impudent reply from
Dedman, who said he couldn’t see that
ex - servicemen’s associations were
“peculiarly fitted” to “advise on high
Government policy.” Only pigheadedness
prevents his seeing it. After all, these
associations are composed of men who,
unlike 16 of Desman’s colleagues,
served in all ranks in the two world wars,
and have a knowledge of their country
and its preparedness needs which no set
of homekeeping politicians could possibly
rival. Had their advice been taken and
acted upon in time Australia would have
been saved rivers of blood and mountains
of treasure. — Rocky (Q.).
