WIT AND HUMOUR
()ME of our correspondents are still
puzzled as to the difference between
wit and humour. Properly seen, there
is no difference, or no difference of
race. There is a distinction of class and
mode only. Wit is condensed humour, with
the relationship of the forked flash to summer
lightning, of the beef extract to the ox.
Both depend essentially upon a perception
of incongruities, but wit farther unfolds
implicit congruities. Humour has a more
individual aspect; wit a wider scope. But
it is always easier to explain by illustration.
Here is E. W. Lucas writing in The Outlook
about days of the week :
Monday, he says, can be flat enough, but in ,a
different way from Tuesday. Monday is flat be
cause one has been idling, perhaps unconsciously,
absorbing notions of living like the lilies; because
so many days must pass before the week ends, be
cause yesterday is no more. But Tuesday has the
sheer essential flatness of nonentity ; Tuesday is
nothing. With all its faults, Monday has a posi
tive character. Monday brings a feeling of revolt
Tuesday, the base craven, reconciles us to the
machine.
With Wednesday, the week stirs itself, turns
over, begins to wake. There are matinees on
Wednesday ; on Wednesday some of the more
genial weekly papers come out. The very wore
has a good honest round air—Wednesday. Things,
adventures, might happen on Wednesday very
naturally; but that nothing ever happened on
a Tuesday I am convinced. I am sure it is my
favourite day.
On Thursday the week falls back a little, the
stirring of Wednesday is not forgotten ; there is a
return to the folding of the hands. 1 am not sure
that Thursday has not become the real day of rest.
That it is a good honest day is the most that can
be said for it. It is certainly not Thor’s day any
longer—if my reading of the character of the
blacksmith god is true. There is nothing strong
and downright and fine about it. .Compared with
Tuesday’s small l>eer. Thursday is almost cham-
pagne ; but none the less they are related ,
I group Friday with Wednesday as a day that
Can be friendly to me, but it has not Wednesday’s
quality. Wednesday is calm, assured, urbane
Friday allows itself to be a little flurried and ex-
cited. Wednesday stands alone ; Friday to some
extent throws in its lot with Saturday. Friday is
too busy. Too many papers come out, too many
bags are packed, on Friday. But herein, of course,
is some of its virtue ; it is the beginning of the
end, the forerunner of Saturday and Sunday.
And so we come to Saturday and Sunday. But
here the analyst falters, for Saturday and Sunday
pass from the region of definable days. Monday
and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and
Friday, these are days with a character fixed more
or less for all. But Saturday and Sunday are
what we individually make of them.
That is clearly Humour. It is idiosyncra-
tic and loitering: it lightens yet does not
flash. Now look at Wit: without searching
for profound instances one may take those
nearest to hand, one whiskered, one a con-
temporary youngster.
Said a tedious counsel to Lord Brougham in a
protracted ease, “My lord. I will now address
myself to the furniture.” Said Brougham,
suavely, “You have been doing that for some
time.”
A food inspector in London recently said he had
summoned a milk retailer for selling watered milk.
He now applied for a summons against the-farmer
who supplied the retailer. Sir Francis Oory-
Wright: “You want to get to the fountain-head.
Granted.”
That is humour concentrated — Wit. And,
with the examples before you, when one
repeats that M it is subjectively intense with
a wide objective range, and Humour sub-
jectively extense with a narrow objective — 1
that Humour, in fact, is always looking
through the large end of Wit’s telescope :
the thing is quite simple ?

Meredith’s books are lengthy reading, which
is not precisely saying that they have des
longueurs. Yet Chas. Legras, a French critic,
points out that we have to live so long in the
company of the characters of any of Meredith’s
novels (about a fortnight, he'reckons) that it is
no wonder we remember them.
Art ancl Architecture ,. No. 2 (Syd., Brooks and
Co. ; Is. (id.). More interesting than the first
number, but less well-printed ; with many small
errors of type and language. D. H. Soutef’s
article on Sid Long's work, bringing together
illustrations of his p.ctures without the attractive
colour, enables one to see how radical are his
faults of drawing and composition. Sydney
Hoben’s article on “Maori Art,” with the splen-
dent illustrations, and S. W. Bacon’s on the
mechanical reproduction of drawings, are well
worth reading. Architecture is represented ; and
on the whole the magazine can be commended
heartily.
“Dom” (a school-teacher) writes :
It is admitted that, to write grammar, children should
read grammar. I cite some blunders disfiguring “ Reader
IV ” used in N.S. W. schools (W. Brooks, publisher):
“ Its base rose and sunk," (p. 99) : “... which, breaking
high with foam-lined its base.” No doubt a typographi-
cal error, but it turns the sentence into an ’absurdity.
“The Song- that Men Should Sing” (p. 101) offends twice.
“ When the tattered folds of this crimson rag was dearer
than life or love ” ; “ When the cheery notes of the stock-
whip’s ring gives place to the rifle’s crash.” Again (p.
104): “...lamenting the. loss of his father, ■ he
concluded was drowned.” This, on p. 34, is vague, at
least “ In the position, in which he was holding his
head, f ought to have hit him about halfway between the
nostrils and the eyes, which was- impossible.” There are
so many other mistakes that it would be worth while for
the editor of the books to examine them carefully.

Til E VYING POET TO BIS WIFE
[Echoes of the announcement of a new Aus-
tralasian anthology had not died away before it
was reported that two other collections were being
made. Also, material is being sought for a book
of the Sublime Sayings of Austral Authors (and
mmd the step!) Further, an Australian Who’s
Who 1 inquirer is plodding persistently round his
circular path. Altogether the despised local
Homer is having something very like the time of
his life —with seven cities in which he
may have begged his bread asking kindly what
o’clock it is. ’Authors who have languished in
obscurity for a dozen years are surprised by'
missives, each more courteous than the other,
desiring noble notions, detailed information, and
profound secresy.
postmen undulating round the Commonwealth,
serenely arriving, arriving, to all, to each, sooner
or later _ bringing Hope of Immortality ? We
Really think it is the postmen. A dying poet may
salute one:—]
MARY ! MARY ! I am dying ! Prop
me up to see the dawn !
Let me watch again Aurora stepping
o’er the rosy lawn.. .
Not that way now, Mary, d—n you ! Don’t
you know the east from west ?
Oh, I beg your pardon, Mary ; but we ’re
fretful at the best—
Horace Said so : good old 1 Horace ... Eh ?
your brother ? No, no, no ! ...
That will do now. Thank you, Mary. Leave
me for a little ... Go !. ..
Dear Aurora ! see her blushing through her
misty morning veil !
She has done me faithful service—though
she i s a trifle stale ;
For the tropes are all exhausted—ah ! the
poet’s lot is hard
In a world of weary cynics crying for a brand-
new bard.
Yes, I thought I was that bard once—thought
that sky and earth and sea
Called in beauty, called in wonder, to be
written up by me ; —
And I wrote them up ! I did that—seven
epics, thirty odes,
Ballads as the stars in number, lyrics in
unnumbered loads !
Toil of genius—whose the profit ? Sacred
Muse ! it wasn’t mine :
Though a foolish generation keeps on asking
for a sign.
For a sign ! as if I hadn’t painted mine
across the heavens :
Here’s your Poet ! Come and Buy Him !
and they came—by six and sevens;
Came to sneer, and growl, and cavil—till I
felt that red-hot skewers
Would not pierce the blockish skulls of
those incompetent reviewers.
So I paid the printers’ bills and wrapped my
toga round my soul,
Writing on, and writing ever, with Posterity
for goal.
Now I ’m dying—poor and friendless—
never introduced to Fame ;
But I know that Future Ages will do honour
to my name...
Mary ! Mary ! where’s that woman ? Oh,
you ’re there ! You might stand by :
Try and soothe my last sad moments, since
you know I’m going to die.
Heat some milk, and bring the rum to stop
that rattle in my throat :
Let me have a decent drink before I board
old Charon’s boat. . .
There’s the postman coming, Mary; never
more he ’ll come to me—
Me the editors once used to hob-a-nob with,
gay and. free :
How my youthful heart would flutter for
rejected MSS.—-
’T was in vain ' and now the brutes have all
forgotten my address. . .
But the postman’s stopping, Mary—surely,
Mary, that is queer :
Now, by all . the bards of Ossian, I believe
he ’$ stopping here !
Off, you gaby ! Goodness me, what is the
woman waiting for •
Give them here, you dolt, you duffer ! there,
you’ve dropped them on the floor...
Three, four, five, six, seven letters—no
mistake about the name—•
More rum, Marti! I am fainting. Mary!
Mary ! this is FAME ! !
I think I ’in better now, Mary : take that wet
rag away :
You know I hate my forehead slopped—no,
never mind ; obey !
Give me the letters here, Mary, and bring
the bottle too ;
You never mix it strong enough ; Mary, you
never do.
Aha!—here’s Jones—yes, Jones it is!—
“compiling an anthology ”...
“ Make extracts ”... why, of course he can
... that does n’t need apology ;
And Robinson—dear me, how strange ! —is
“ m iking a collection,”
And begs the honour to include my “Ode
to Vivisection.”
And Bones asks most politely—yes, he asks
me .• Mary, look !
To add the lustre of my name to grace his
little book.
And Simpson wants my autograph—l ’ll write
it now 7 —and hark !
Here’s Smith desires my portrait for his
“Famous Men of Mark” ;
And Brown would like ‘ ‘ some passages of
genius ” in a letter ;
And Harrison requires my “life,” and “ will
remain mv debtor ! ”
* * * *
Fame ! fame at last! I knew it would come,
though it nearly arrived too late ;
But now I am better, now I am well, now I
am lord of my fate...
Dying ? Who talked about dying ? Not I !
I could conquer a host;
And I ’ll answer these gentlemen now, Mary
—and you ’ll have to run to the post.
My brain is on fire—no, it is n’t the rum—
’t is the genius of ancient delight
Exalts me and thrills me with rapturous bliss,
and showers on me images bright.
Quick, give me my dressing-gown, Mary !
don’t stand staring there while I write...
Now go —and no noise till I’m finished —or
I ’ll murder you, Mary, to-night !
SON IDEE, SA VIE
Some “ apothegms and pensees ” sent by
Arthur Lynch—a man who differs from
others in this : that he did gladly offer life
and all to maintain his vision of Freedom.
Artists are children; poets are adolescents;
philosophers should be men.
Truly as I reflect on niy experiences I recognise
how great a virtue is honesty. I do not mean
any sublimated or metaphysical virtue of honour,
but simple honesty, as we all should think it. A
man who is in all circumstances honest, honest in
his soul, is a man for whom it is worth while to
go through fire arid water. He is one of the
precious things of this earth. He is a man in a
million.
When I see how great a proportion of one’s in-
come goes in mere ornament and in luxuries, and
when I reflect how small a proportion of it is given
to the general cause of the nation, I feel that here-
in is a great strain of immorality vitiating the
people, or, rather; that the sense of public morality
has not been sufficiently developed ; and I see how
possible it may be to turn even the fashion of
thought toward those great standards of mutual
advancement which are the basis of the true
republic.
What would be thought of a general and staff of
officers who directed their whole attention to the
sweating and driving of their troops, and who
lived in shameful and pernicious luxury in the
sight of their famished soldiers ? And yet is mili-
tary life to teach us a lesson of morality in the
matters that appertain to civil life? This point
should be driven home.
Society is formed of republicans, princes, and
domestic servants.
A great aphorism is as rare as a great sonnet; a
great sonnet is as rare as a great epic. The reason
is that each demands great qualities of heart, great
experience, and subtle intelligence,
A great sonnet is as true and deep as a great
principle of nature; and of such a principle the
bright and quick expression that lights with sur-
prise is the aphorism.
Of the fine qualities of the soul I would nam®
courtesy. But by that Ido not mean such manners
as would be included in the vile principle that
“ politeness costs nothing.” Politeness should
cost a life. I would rather see the courtesy that
springs from deep sympathy with what is best in
others, and which emanates from the soul in its
distillation of genial and good spirit. This is not
inconsistent with strength; rather, it implies
strength.
That was a deep appreciation of Shakespeare,
“the Sweet witty soul of Ovid.” It brings to
light so much of what is hid in the orthodox appre-
ciation of the man.
One has not lived till one has loved ; and a life
that expires without having sacrificed to some
loved object has been but a false shoot in the great,
movement of the world. This love, in a man, is
projected towards an ideal ; in woman, it may be
incarnated in a man.
The intellect should be a luminous beam playing
through and rendering comprehensible the course
of life; and. if possible, by a hardy philosophic
line cast forth in advance, whether by deep study,
or by a sort of philosophic instinct, or both, the
philosophy should precede the experience. Lucky
are we if that line of philosophy he verified ; but
not wholly hopeless if it be cast down by our ex-
periences ; for it will ever afford a standard to which
we can refer; and thus we may gradually arrive
at a true and well-understood theory.
We must always have an aristocracy : crede
experto. Let our aristocracy be an aristocracy, of
merit. Let the currents of liberalism so nourish
the entire body politic that it will make leas and
less difference to a boy whether he be the son of a
dustman or the son of a duke.
What has counted in the way of the world’s
civilisation has been science, art, literature, the
passions—these have been the encouragements,
the amusements, the distractions of the great
mysterious journey : but science only has been
effective in opening up new horizons to men, in
gaining new vistas in the strange, eternal voyage
in quest of God.
Why should philosophy put on a sour and for-
bidding aspect? I would like to see the philoso-
pher in silk stockings and buckled shoes, accom-
plished in mind and in body, grave, courteous,
considerate, and not indifferent to any form of
human activity. I would have him enjoy a foot-
race, a poem, the beauty of a fine woman, .even as
the subtle explications of science.
Frederic Harrison printed in his essay o
Buskin some illuminating remarks on allitera-
tion. Alliteration, as an artful aid, is not so
simple as it seems. It should be felt without
being visible. “O, lips full of lust and or
laughter,” for example, is bad alliteration ; ana
Frederic Harrison knows it. So in his recent
counterblast against tobacco be did not
“The habitual smoker habitually smells. He
wrote, “The habitual smoker habitually stinks.
We don’t deny that other reasons may have
directed his choice of the word, but we like to
think that even in the full heat and torrent of his
rage he remembered his rhetoric, and was con-
soled, were it ever so little, by his art. If Art
cannot console us, why does The Daily Telegraph
print pictures of the Show ?
Our April magazines. Steele Rudd’s, had it been
published at date, would have contained an
admirable article on dengue fever, which pros-
trate 1 the staff and all its relatioi-s, a*

new editor will be ,1. F. Millington, who has
written several memorable tales in The Bulletin.

account of Tas. saw-milling. Life persists in

Writes “ Chip ”
The scientific definition of Love (6/4/5) somewhat dis-
concerts the accepted poetical ideas in which the heart
plays so important a part. How would O. L. Rivers
recent verse “ Vale 1 ” sound if adapted to the statements
quoted by Ellis in reference to the emotional importance
of the skin ? Like this ?
“Dick” writes:
As to Women’s Insides. The tight-lacers are in a
minority- for one tight-lacer there are many natural-
figure women. You do harm when you make this minor
vice responsible for the empty cradle. The major vice is
the system under which we live, whereby the father of
a family usually has a worse time than the bachelor.
When' monopoly of land and monopoly of money have had
a good long innings, the mass of the people are virtually
enslaved. And now the slaves are ceasing- to breed, for
degraded as they are, they still love their potential
children, and they don’t like the prospect for them offered
by a monopolistic world. Women will do what their
lovers wish : if hE desires progeny, and healthy, SHE will
aid at any expense of her prejudices and pleasures.
Also as to the Collectivist Ideal. Were we all in the
same boat, the influence of the mass would tend to
efficiency. When every honest man’s bread and butter
was a certainty, man’s competitive instincts would be
employed in obtaining honour. The boy plays up for his
side : the man holds up his end when working with his
mates: the Department, under a collectivist regime,
would sweat itself for the general weal, in face of loss ol
prestige.
Look how we bred in Maoriland at first, when land was
cheap, money almost non-existent, and hope was normal.
Under those good conditions the people were kindly,
hospitable, contented, good-natured, and took pride in
their work: in fact, they realised to some extent the
ideals of Christ and of Bernard Shaw. It is infernal con-
ditions that make devils of us all.
“Exile” writes:— . ;..V .
As to water finding in Australia. In 1898 I was in-
terested in a Coolgardie well which, like nearly all there,
went dry. An old gentleman, whose name, I believe,
was Dorrington, called at the Miner office one day and
claimed the ability to find water or mineral. I promptly
conducted him to the dry well. Producing a short leng th
of copper wire, he bent it in the middle and, holding out
his hands palms upwards, passed the ends of the wire
between the thumb and forefinger and then between the
third and little fingers of each hand. The wire was quite
loosely held. ,
He then commenced to pace steadily round the welL
On reaching the south side the wire seemed to spring up-
wards, the apex- striking him sharply on the vest. At
that he made a mark with his heel and proceeded. The
wire soon afterwards dropped forward quite slack, and he
marked again. These two marks indicated a space about
4 feet wide along which, he asserted, there was a nice
stream of water running east and west.
Water was at that time very valuable and worth a little
risk, so we put a couple, of men on to drive in the
direction indicated. When in about 7to 8 feet they struck
a nice flow, which forced out the drill, and rendered a
prompt return to grass on the part of the men urgently
necessary.
While I remained in the West they were never able to
get down to open, up the drill hole. I discovered after-
wards that we had tapped the stream which had hitherto
supplied an Afghan’s well two blocks away, but we did
not lose any sleep at night on that account. Mr. Dor-
rington was a well-dressed and evidently well-educated
man, and told me he had been a member of the South
Australian Assembly. I believe I read of his death about
three years ago, but there must be many Bulletin readers
who remember the very polite, quiet-spoken old gentle-
man to whom I have every reason to feel very grateful.
The principle of American copyright law until
recently has been to refuse copyright to foreign
books not first published and printed in America.
The Athenaeum reports that Congress has decided
that in future twelve months grace shall be given
to books in foreign languages— i.e., that first or
simultaneous publication in U.S.A. shall be no
longer required, yet copyright may be given if the
book is reprinted in TJ.S.A. within twelve month*.
It seems probable that the concession will be ex-
tended to English books also. This decision fol-
lows the Canadian plan, though the Canadian
grace is only three months, and the use of foreign
stereo plates is permitted without any compulsion
that the type be actually set in Canada. One
hopes that the Australian Minister of Customs-
said now to be drafting a copyright Bill—will
follow the Canadian model.

Skin's skin, farewell! The twilight shades
Stoop downward like the frown of Fate,
0 sweetly fair of all fair maids,
With tissue eiotheii inviolate.
Hostile bacteria, and cold
And heat, and change electrical,
Against that wall of adamant,
Emasculated, dying, fall!
Skin’s skin, our joyance here was brief
And splendid as the glory slime
Of tissue, silk-like to the feel
And snail’s antennai-touch divine ;
But science coldly steps between
And calls our kiss a “ sucking bite,”
Kills sentiment with lengthy words
And banishes our brief delight !
Skin’s skin, be brave ! though joy is slain
And love ecstatic’s out of date,
A nd we may never meet again,
Skin-hearts , responsive, osculate:
Heat-regulating moans, strong,
Impervious -more than rubber hose,
May we stand once more skin to skin,
Where fate is dead, at brief life’s close !

complaints should consult Dr. MARTIN, always feeling certain that by so doing they will find a friend in need ;
one who will not turn a deaf ear to them, be their complaint what it may. Many, on the other hand, think that
because their muscular system is strongly developed, they do not require attention. This is a fallacy: for
apparently trivial symptoms often lead to the most disastrous results.

GENERAL DEBILITY
COMPLETE PROSTRATION.
SOMETHING LIKE A CURE.
The Case of Mrs. E. LAWES.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
As the following case achieved un-
usual notoriety it is proper that the
main facts should be put belore the
public in complete form. We are in-
debted to Airs, Lmily Lawes, of Mo.
21 Kedfern-street, Redfern, for the nar-
rative, which was begun in answer to
this statement by a reporter : —
“I have been informed that about
thirteen j ears ago you caused general
surprise by shaking off a serious ill-
ness. Will you kindly give me the par-
ticulars
“With pleasure,” acquiesced Mrs.
Lawes. ‘Wes ; it s all thirteen years
since my T nlncss, for it was after my
first child was born that I sank into
such a pitiful state of weakness that
for six weary weeks 1 could not put
my foot to the ground. The nurse who
attended me told mother she thought
1 was going into a decline, and you
ehoiuld have seen me then. You would!
have thought so, too. Talk about
feebleness ! ft was awful. I had a lit-
tle dog that came into my room one
night and jumped on the bod, and
would you believe that I didn't havo
enough strength to push him off 1"
“At the end of sux weeks were you
any better ?”
“If .1 was it was very slightly, I can
tell you, for I was just barely able to
stand, and that was all. The nurse
used to say : ‘Lor goodness sake don’t
go to the door because you look so
wretched.’ and, my word, I felt
wretched. When I persisted in trying
to crawl for a few yards about the
house, it was impossible for me to
straighten myself up, and there 1 was
—bent double lika an old woman. But
it wasn’t every day that I could get
up, and 1 remember on one occasion a
relative coming into my bedroom,
and, after looking at me, rushing out,
saying : ‘Come in, film’s dead !’ so
wiTl give you an idea of the
deathly appearance I bore. The truth
was, i atterwards learned, that she
could not notice me breathing, my re-
spiration was so feeble, and that, com-
bined with the fact that I was not ex-
pected to recover, gave her the idea
at once that I was dead. I was very
near it though, and I’m sure I never
thought for a moment that I would
ever recover. But there is a Divine
Providence watching over all of us,
and He did not desert me in my hour
of need. I had got so fearfully thin
that it must have been painful to look
at me.”
“Have you any idea what weight
you were then ?’
“I was greatly reduced, and as
ghastly a mortal as you could find in
a day’s march. Well, I was going to
tell you about the blessings that were
afterwards showered upon me. By some
means or other, when death was un-
doubtedly staring me in the face, I
got into touch with Clements Tonic, a
remedy that 1 had heard a good deal
about, and do you know that the dif-
ference which that medicine made in
me was something extraordinary? Up
till then I had the greatest difficulty
in the world in making myself eat.
Let the food be as nicely prepared,
and as light as it could possibly be, it
was all the same—one or two mouth-
fuls, and 1 was done. But not so with
the pain. It was then that it started.
My chest felt chocked up with some-
thing, and I was oppressed almost to
suffocation. Hot flushes used to come
and go. the blood rushing to my head,
and making me feel quite giddy, while
•the pains in my head nearly distract-
ed me. Now, this is what I liked
about Clements Tonic. It was abso-
lutely the only medicine to do me good
in regard to those symptoms.’-
“How many others had you given a
trial to ?”
“A great number. I took all sorts
of physics, and not one of them ap-
pealed to my case at all. They we.e
absolutely worthless. i5ut C.cmouts
Tonic acted like a charm. I could ie„*l
it inst.lling fresh vigour into me as
distinctly as one feels the warm glow
of a welcome lire on a winter's night,
and shortly after commencing with it
1 began to feel hungry. This was sure-
ly something surprising. But what
will you think when 1 tell you that
Clements Tonic so acted upon my in-
ternal organs that my food started to
digest again ? Why, there are people
who saw me at the time, who heard
me say how much Clements Tonic had
done, and yet could scarcely belleve
their eyes or ears. But it was an in
disputable fact that I was on the
mend, and to my dying day 1 shall
thank Clements Tonic for it. I u ed
to sleep very indifferently, and awoke
feeling nona the fresher f >r the r si I had
got—in fact, I was always so weary
and melancholy, and had such an in-
tense aching feeling right through my
body that I often felt that I would
like to lie down and die. I don’t look
as if I am much troubled with such
gruesome thoughts now, though, do 1?”
“-No ; you certainly look the picture
of health, Mrs. Lawes.”
“That’s what everybody tells me,
which shows what can happen in even
the most hopeless cases so long as a
few bottles of Clements Tonic can be
got. Goodness me, 1 am now over
twelve stone weight, and have had six
child ten since Clements Tonic snatched
me from the grave thirteen years ago,
and I can honestly tell you that from
then till now I have not had one day’s
illness. That will show you whether
my cure was a complete one or not.
But T don’t think ]’ve told you half I
vvent through yet. 1 didn’t refer to the
times that 1 had giddy seizures—well,
they were very numerous occasions
indeed ; and I didn’t say anything
about the horrible feeling of fulness in
the stomach which used to come on
when 1 liad been given some refresh-
ment. This was before using Clements
Tonic, you know. Afterwards, I was
not like the same woman, for I could
eat anything, and not oxper’ence the
least inconvenience, every particle of
pain arising from indigestion having
disappeared. There is another thing I
would like to mention in order to
point out what a snlendid all-round
remedy Clements Tonic is. It is that
during my illness mv heart was great-
lv affected with palpitation, and. un-
der the influence of Clements Tonic
j that trouble left me. Again, I was one
1 of the most nervous of women, and if
I I happened to be left in the house
alone I felt so timid that I dared not
move, while to be without a light was
always enough to make me fret terri-
bly. You’ve no idea the excessive mis-
ery my nervousness brought me. and
i as I’ve been free from it all these
years it’s time similar sufferers had the
i benefit of my experience.”
“So I’ll print it ?”
“Certainly : in any way you please
you may publish it.”

Various Verses.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Captive.
“ The Land is master,” moans the Sea—
Poor, bonded slave, his fetters gall—
Tho’ kindly bards may hail him free,
He knows and hates the tyrant’s thrall.
At Dawn’s pale light he woos the shore
With lover’s coaxing, tender song.
“More room,” his wavelets beg, and “More ”
His rollers croon, the whole day long.
Anon he comes in royal might,
With darkling face not good to see ;
And, mad with rage, the livelong night
His breakers shriek, “ We will be free ! ”
At times, in plaintive, tearful mood.
His passion spent, he sobs his plea.
At times he seems to fret and brood,
But dreams, for aye, of Liberty.
•And dreams in vain ; the sturdy rocks
Defiant stand, in silent scorn ;
The heartless shore his striving mocks—
This hapless king, his purple shorn.
N.S.W.
P.J.D.
A Prayer.
Lord of my life, when, at the set of sun,
Low stoop the dreams from out the skies —of
Death—
To drowse me in my sleep, and one by one,
Filch every heaving breath, —
Grant, in Thy graciousness, the splendid time
Of dewy dawn, in a dear pastern sky,
Along the hillside where the young winds climb,
For me to die.
Beneath the shadow of the wild wood heights
Take what is Thine, but leave me quiet there,
That I may know in glorious, golden nights
The nightingale’s fine prayer.
A lonely star is drowned against the sky,
The clouds reel by, the world is all a-frown.
The Dark has ravished the Day, and I
Can hear the Dreams loom down !
Q.
C. L. RIVERS.
March.
March’s arms are lily-brimming,
Roses crown her rippling hair;
March’s eyes are sunshine swimming,
And her voice is sweet and clear.
March, they say, is surely dying,
Soon, they murmur, she’ll be gone—
For they see young April trying
For her sister’s vacant throne.
March, I cling to you with yearning,
Comrade of my lonely walks ;
But (alas !) the leaves are turning,
Close behind young April stalks !
-March, ’tis come, the hour of parting ;
Kiss me, friend, and flit away ;
Tears within my eyes are smarting—
April, be not quite so gay !
vio.
DOROTHY FRANCES McCRAE.
Frailty.
What did the good sun see to-day,
As he sank to rest in a stormy crush
Of tumbled clouds?—Ah, better not say—
Since he went down with an angry blush.
You vowed last eve that you would be true,
And the sun went down without a frown ;
But what did you do to-day, I wonder,
That made him blush through his clouds of
thunder?
What did the good sun see to-day
That angered him as he went to rest ?
He saw—ah, well, let us only say,
A girl’s false heart in a girl’s fair breast.
And yet, ’tis strange, when the sun went down
In his red storm skies, he showed surprise
(Full strange for him who sees all things human)
That you —a woman—should be but a woman.
N.s.w.
RODERIO QUINN.
The Jest of the Gods.
The high gods sate at festival;
The nectar passed around ;
And gushed from out that crystal hall
Bewitching streams of sound.
But when, awhile, the music died,
And song began to flag :
“A jest! a jest!” great Zeus, he cried,
His mighty beard a-wag.
“ Now, ev’ry god to flesh descends—
Till flesh is dust again;
To blindly work for god-like ends,
Nor know himself till then.”
Thus Zeus, and quick the giant hall
Its approbation roared ;
“ Agreed ! agreed ! ” cried one and all—
“ Agreed !” rang round the board.
So when, with downward glance, to-day,
On earth the spirit creeps ;
Imprisoned in impervious day,
The God within us sleeps.
Yet, now and then, celestial tints
May touch this murky stage—
A thousand promptings give us hints
Of heavenly lineage.
For when our love towards fellow-men,
Some act of mercy proves,
With half-extended pinion then
The God within us moves.
And when the stroke of knightly death
This sad enchantment breaks,
Emerging with our severed breath
The God within us wakes!
N.S.W.

ITCHING HUMOURS
SPEEDY CURE TREATMENT
FOR EVERY HUMOUR.
Bathe the affected parts with hot water and CUTICURA
SOAP, to cleanse the skin and scalp of crusts and scales, and
soften the thickened cuticle. Dry, without hard rubbing, and
apply CUTICURA OINTMENT freely to allay itching, irritation,
and inflammation, and soothe and heal, and lastly take CUTI-
CURA RESOLVENT PILLS, to cool and cleanse the blood.
This pure, sweet, and wholesome treatment affords instant
relief, permits rest and sleep, and points to a speedy, perman-
ent, and economical cure of the most torturing, disfiguring,
itching, burning, and scaly skin, scalp, and blood humours,
eczemas, rashes, and irritations, from infancy to age, with
loss of hair, when all else fails.
MILLIONS USE CUTICURA SOAP
Assisted by Cuticura Ointment, for preserving, purifying, and beautify-
ing the skin, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the
stopping of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough,
and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, and for all the pur-
poses of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Millions of Women use Cuticura
Soap in the form of baths for annoying irritations, inflammations, and
excoriations, for too free or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes
for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many sanative, antiseptic purposes which
readily suggest themselves to women, especially mothers.
CUTICURA RESOLVENT PILLS, CHOCOLATE COATED,
Are a new, tasteless, odourless, economical substitute for the celebrated liquid Cuticura
Resolvent, as well as for all other blood purifiers and humour cures. Put up in screw,
cap pocket vials containing 60 doses. Cuticura Pills are alterative, antiseptic, toDic,
and digestive, and beyond question the purest, sweetest, most successful and economical
blood and skin purifiers, humour cures, and tonic-digestives, yet compounded.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
g
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? if so, try
our great remedy.

THE PILLS
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as '* run-down ’* or u out of sorts. Females
of every age find Holloway's Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, 01(2
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every
kind, and should be used in conjunction with the
Pills. It is also the speediest remedy for Rheu-
matism, Lumbago, Pains and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,
Holloway's Ointment affords most welcome relief
in a very short time.

How to Address I.otters.
Correspondents to Tiie Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (tvith regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
■mvi te inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of

bWums submitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
two columns in length, or, say, SOQO words, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs, Letters, or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.

CONCERNING A UNITED SYDNEY.
Whereas The Bulletin has recently “had its
attention drawn,” by that aggressive and impartial
re r ormer the Plague and its yellow brother the
Dengue, to the fact that the large and populous city
of Sydney has no municipal organisation worth a
rap ; that its government is split up into 50 or 00
small pocket-handkerchief boroughs of ridiculously
inadequate powers, and is misgoverned by an army
of 600 or 700 aldermen, mostly all afflicted with
that tired feeling. And whereas this paper
has also noted the fact that the bubonic rat is
playing its annual season in Sydney, and that the
alleged municipal bodies aforesaid, with no par-
ticular powers, are trying to chase it to their
borders, having no guarantee that the pursuit will
be continued in the neighboring pocket-handker-
chief borough. And whereas this paper
remembers that most cities of the same size (and
also of half and quarter the size) in Britain have
one efficient and powerful council governing their
whole area, carrying on huge municipal and
Socialistic services as owners (for the people) of
docks, ferries, trams, gas, electric-light, model
dwellings, sewage farms, and other things (all of
which pay interest, redemption funds, and
dividends with commendable regularity, and
without causing any appreciable deteriora-
tion of the sanctity of the home and
the marriage-tie). And whereas The Bulletin
has heard faintly, as from a far distance, that Mr.
Carrutiiers has been incubating a municipal
reform scheme, this paper, borrowing his ear,
takes this opportunity of whispering therein the
following memorial on the subject of Sydney :
• * * •
We desire to recall your attention to the fact
that we are the gateway of the Pacific, the portal
of the Commonwealth, the front door of Austral-
asia, the city of the Beautiful Harbor, and—
unless Coghlan is a liar—the fourth in trade of
the cities of the British Empire. The growth of
the population of Sydney during the last decade
has been so great that, at the same rate of increase,
in about 20 years we will probably have a million
people here. We desire to point out that the
inner city is a narrow-streeted, place,
and that the amazingly rapid growth of the out-
lying suburbs is a danger, inasmuch as the primi-
tive conditions of the earlier growth are being re-
produced—narrow streets, faulty construction,
jerry building, insufficient air-space, no provision
for parks, playgrounds, or open spaces. In short,
all the conditions which, within a few years, create
slums, disease, and premature death, are arising
from day to day, and problems which should be
easily settled now are being passed on to vex the
citizens of the future.
.* * * •
e desire (with rising indignation) to draw your
attention to the fact that the natural beauty of the
area upon which the city is built is being rapidly
defaced by hideous advertisements, and by con-
ditions arising from neglect, which a powerful and
vigilant Greater Sydney Council (if we had
one) would speedily forbid. No proper pro-
vision is being made for lung spaces for these
newly-created suburbs, and the splendid primeval
forests on the metropolitan area are being rapidly
cut down by rich vandals who build suburban
owiss-El l zabethan mixtures, and replace the mag-
nificent gum trees with funereal pines and other
horrid vegetables. These splendid forests should
be conserved, as “like a bold peasantry, their
country’s pride, when once destroyed, can never be
supplied. ” Natural park spaces which are available
now will soon disappear before the rapid growth
of the red-tiled roof of suburban settlement, and
there is no municipal authority now in existence
which has power enough, or which cares enough,
to interfere to prevent the denudation of the
beauty spots of our splendid native trees. A
green girdle round the city, which is the dream of
the Londoner, is possible in Sydney now. But it
is a disappearing possibility.
* * « •
We would also beg you to note that in the cen-
tj6 i u a Clt y- festering slums exist, which no
Health Act can make clean; areas in which
workers are compelled to herd, to the injury of
their health, the deterioration of the race, and the
waste of precious human life ; and no provision
has been made by Parliament for the better hous-
lng of those who are forced to live near the centre
of things in order to be near their, often precarious,
chances of work.
* * * *
We desire to point out that in these days of
municipal progress, when great cities are discover-
ing the enormous advantages of the new science
of modern civic (co-operative or Socialistic)
government, the citizens of Sydney have a
«ght to expect a better municipal system
than they have now. They turn to yOu
to Parliament, and ask that the scandal
of divided control, inadequate power, and the
usurpation of municipal functions by non-elective
or partially elective Governmental Boards and
trusts, shall cease, and that all the functions
which are properly municipal shall be divided
from those which are purely governmental, and
entrusted to the. citizens through their elected
representatives in one central Municipal or
County Council.
* * * *
We pass over the fact that the principles ©f our
present Municipal Acts were laid down by Lord
John Bussell away back in the ’thirties (before
you were born, young man), and we therefore do
not hold you responsible for the defects which
exist, and which have created in the people of this
btate a disposition to lean up against the nearest
Government ist discernible on the horizon, and
wait for someone in a Government department to
do something after a pile of correspondence with
the local member. We do not take it down in
evidence to be used against you that out of 300,000
square miles of N.S..W. territory (about twice the
area of Japan) there is only about a hundredth part
with any local government bodies in existence at all,
and most of these are bankrupt and incapable.
We will confine ourselves strictly to the city of
Sydney, and impress upon you that the problems
of that city must be treated separately, as the
highly organised and complex services of a great
city require special treatment. We ask you to
give the citizens of Sydney power to elect one
Central Council to govern the whole metropolitan
area. We request you to abolish the 50 or 60
semi-bankrupt boroughs which now exist, and to
take measures to render metaphorically fatal the
sleeping sickness which now infects the 600 or 700
aldermen.
* » « *
A\ liile upon this subject, we would respectfully
warn you against following the example set by the
British Parliament with regard to London. In
that great nation-city divided control exists in
all its horrors. In order that the picturesque
though useless flummery of municipal tradition
might be preserved, the Tories divided London
into 33 boroughs, each with a mayor (with robe
and gown), a town clerk (with a wig), and all the
other liveried but unnecessary officials. Above
these useless bodies stands the London Council,
whose chairman is not a mayor or a Lord Mayor,
and who may sit (if he chooses) in a sac suit or
pyjamas instead of robes and ermine. The London
County Council, innocent of frippery, has done
splendid work, its only trouble being the difficulty
of overcoming the competition of the 33 boroughs
which get in its way, and get trodden on in the
stress of work. You will be asked by all the tin-pot
boroughs on the Greater Sydney area to preserve
their useless existences and continue their func-
tions, which consist mainly of pillow-fight coun-
cil meetings and renewals of overdrafts.
* * * *
We, therefore, becoming emboldened by the
fact that so far you have not interjected on us,
tell you plainly that we, your memorialists, will
not have municipal federation on the London
plan, which will perpetuate the existence of the
present councils and hordes of aldermen, instead
of painfully extinguishing them ; but demand
resolutely one central, absolute council, modelled
on Glasgow, Birmingham, or Liverpool, which
will takeover the debts, the powers and the obli-
gations of the present councils (including the City
Council), and of the Government boards; with
such powers over and above as are necessary to
conduct the services of a great city as they should
be conducted. We cannot see why, if 75 Scotch
councillors can govern the city of Glasgow, with
nearly a million of inhabitants, in such a way as
to make it a model for Europe and America, it
requires 600 Australian aldermen to govern a city
half the size. The inference that it requires a
large number of Australians to do a thing badly,
which a few Scotchmen can do brilliantly, will
require more argument than has hitherto been
adduced. Our opinion is that, if Australian city
dwellers get a chance, they will, by the exercise
of that genius for progressive democracy which
distinguishes .them, eclipse even the highest
manifestations, of. municipal statesmanship, as
displayed in Birmingham and Glasgow. .
* * * •
We, your memorialists, know that you will be
told that the red-tiled suburb can have nothing in
common with the Sydney slum, and that, there-
fore, the comparative density of the population
should be considered in the preservation of the
present small, tin-pot municipalities on the
greater Sydney area. While admitting that the
density of the individual may have something
to do with the case, we contend that the
density of the population has nothing; as in
such vital matters as public health, the sanitary
condition of the slum is a large question for
everyone on the area. The operations of that
impartial reformer, the Plague, recently demon-
strated this; and it is now well-ascertained that
the measure of the immunity of the slum from
insanitary conditions is the measure of the security
of the mansion and the red tiled roof from epi-
demic disease. The Bulletin feels strongly on
this, as it is itself a husband, a father, a ratepayer,
and a red-tiled roofer, and therefore plumps for a
Greater Sydney Council, which can, at any rate,
deal with the vital question of Public Health in a
large way, and can continue the pursuit of a plagub-
stncken rat all over the area, instead of having to'
stop at the border of each pocket-handkerchief
borough, and ask permission of the mayor, aider-
men, town-clerk and inspector of nuisances on the
other side.
* * * *
Finally, we are of opinion that all cities
decay and ought to be rebuilt periodically, and
improved in the building; and we implore you to
read up history, which will show that Birming-
ham, a city about the size of our own, resumed a
slum (its council having power given by Parlia-
ment so to do) where infant life could not exist,
cleared it, and built on it —or caused to be built—
one of the finest business streets in Europe—
Corporation-street. You will find that that
scheme of improvement will give a property
worth three millions sterling to the citizens of
Birmingham within about 30 years from now, as
the ground was let on building leases, and these
will fall in to the Council at the end of a 75 years
term. We need hardly go on to show that enor-
mous profits can be made out of the re-building of
the squalid portions of this ancient city, if we had
one small, but powerful, council in existence, filled
with men representative of all classes of citizens—
like those of Glasgow and Birmingham—and a
P u “l 'u had developed the municipal spirit,
and had learned to look at Sydney as one and
indivisible, and forgotten to regard the man in
Balmain, or Wahroonga, or Manly, or Hurstville
as a foreigner, an Outlander, and a t’othersider.
* * . *
We recognise that there are many difficult
problems to be dealt with; but these can-
not be settled either by conferences of aider-
men, select committees of Parliament, or
Royal Commissions, however ably manned; and
this is proved by the fact that both London and
New York municipal government schemes,
as they now stand, are the work of commissions,
and they both give the greatest possible dissatis-
faction. We recommend that you create one
constituency, and, voting on the Parliamentary
franchise, ask the citizens to elect about 40 men of
common sense and intelligence to draft a Charter,
which, after submission to a referendum, and ac-
ceptance by the citizens of Sydney, Parliament
may pass into law. That charter should pro-
vide one central Council for the whole
Greater Sydney area, and should abolish all
minor municipal bodies. We would cause Parlia-
ment to give such a Council power to rfesume
slum lands and re-build the areas, to re-model the
city by cutting wide avenues to splendid boule-
vards where foul and foetid slums now exist;
to take over and control gas supply and water
supply and hydraulic power supply, as the
City Council now controls the electric supply ;
to acquire and manage the ferries, and the
wharves, and the beautiful harbor, and the
parks; to build model dwellings for workmen;
to stamp out plague and the still more deadly
consumption, and typhoid, by destroying the
germ morasses of slums which were planned and
built at a time when sanitation and hygienic and
bacteriological science and the builders’ and
plumbers’ arts were as yet undiscovered, or in
their infancy. This would be a genuine “Reform,”
which could not be declared “bogus” even by the
worst of your enemies on the Sydney daily press,
who have been pelting stones at you from behind
ever since the great “Reform ” victory.
ENTERPRISE OF ONE SORT AND
ANOTHER.
Ip a man went to a banker or a merchant and sought
credit, and, being asked what his securities were,
replied “ a lot, ” the banker or the merchant would
probably reckon he had a fool or a rogue to deal
with, and would ask him to get to business and
give details. Yet the same banker or merchant
doesn’t hesitate to be just as vague and unsatis-
factory as that when he approaches public affaiis.
He denounces Socialism, and proves what a vague
and unsatisfactory person he is by asking for
Socialism in the next breath. Pressed a
little, he instances the Arbitration Act, though
the Socialist —the thorough-going Socialist—
damns that Act violently. The Arbitration Act,
says the man of finance, is “ playing the devil "
with business. But lie will never, or rarely, come
down to hard, concrete facts, and show a balance-
sheet. If he puts in a new machine, he works out
the result and shows that it saved him per
cent. But as for this “Socialistic legislation”
that is ruining him, he refuses anything more
definite than a comprehensive curse. And some-
times, after a more comprehensive curse than
usual, he mentions casually that his directors will
pay the usual 10 per cent, dividend, with a per
cent, bonus. He drops quite naturally into de-
finite statements only at that stage.
* * * *
Occasionally, but very rarely, he meets another
business man, whose business it happens to be to
more or less defend these things, and then he has
to get down to facts. There was a case of this sort
a while ago. The iron trade people had a griev-
ance against Socialism as represented by the
Fitzroy Hock, in Sydney Harbor. The Fitzroy
Hock had tendered for work at a price with which
they could not compete ; and as it is an article of
the anti-Socialists’ faith that Private Enter-
prise can always do things cheaper than
the State, there was obviously fraud or trickery or
corruption. And they knew how that kind of
thing could be worked—the State got the job, and
then charged part of the cost to repairs, and so
hid the loss. Now, it is safe to say things like
that in a general way ; such things are said in the
clubs, and on Patman platforms, every week.
But part of the deputation made the mistake of
applying it to particular works ; so at last there
was a chance to probe the matter. _ Then the thing
happened that might have been expected to hap-
pen. No attempt was made to support the
charge. On the contrary, it was withdrawn as
soon as it was shown that it could be
tested. “ What had been said was said
in a general way.” Precisely. If the iron-
people were charged in a general way with being a
thief, and a j udge in a general way sentenced the
lot to seven years, folk would believe that jus-
tice was taking a rest. Some might even have
stronger opinions upon that subject if, when one
iron founder was put up for regular trial, the
accuser turned tail and ran. The “ general way ”
business deserves only contempt. And it gets
contempt in practically every relation of life
ex cept in politics.
* • * *
The worst of the charges against State Enter-
prise as represented by the Fitzroy Dock was
thus withdrawn; what remained was that it
competed unfairly with Private Enterprise by
taking contracts at unprofitable prices, and
making up the los3 out of public revenue. But
again Private Enterprise was in difficulties when
it got down to details. It instanced two small
jobs ; and it was proved that these were taken, not
with the object of making a profit, but simply in
order to keep the works open. Primarily the
dock is part of the naval defence of the country ;
and it must, therefore, always be available.
Because of that, work was occasionally taken at
a rate which covered wages and cost of material
flus 10 per cent, for supervision and use of tools.
t was contended that to this should have been
added interest, depreciation, and other standing
charges. Private Enterprise alleged that it had
to include such items, that the State works
were unfairly competing with them by not
running the business on sound commercial
principles, and that, but for this, State Enterprise
could not compete with Private Enterprise. The
argument is nonsense, and every business man
knows it. Even the little man who runs the
grocery-store at the corner knows ; he makes sugar
a “ catch-line,” and sells it at next-to no profit; it
brings custom, and keeps him going. The big
manufacturer knows it—for he does on a huge
scale what the dock did on a little ; that is how he
makes the stuff which he is able to “dump” at
knock-out rates. Undoubtedly the Fitzroy Dock
ought to pay interest and sinking fund ; it ought
to keep and show a profit and loss account; but it
isn’t for its competitors to say what special jobs
shall be made to pay that interest and sinking-
fund contribution. If they have the right to tell
that to the State management, then the State
management, as a competitor on equal terms, has
the same right to take the management of the
private works out of their owners’ hands.
• * * *
In other words, if State Enterprise would give
up well-recognised business methods, Private
Enterprise could beat it. But because it won’t,
Private Enterprise can’t. That is the conclusion
of that matter. And while that was being proved
by the hardware people, the software people were
proving much the same thing before the same
Public Service Board. The N.S, W. State Cloth-
Factory in 1903-4 supplied garments at a cost
of £17,743. Comparing that with the price paid
before the State Factory was open, and allowing
for differences in cost of materials, the board
finds that the whole of the clothing required by
the Government could be supplied by the State
factory for £G93 over the private contractors’
price. And only this very small loss (in a
total turnover of about £30,000) would accrue
even though the State paid in every branch
and for every article the highest wage paid
by the most liberal of the outside factories. Some
of those factories pay as little, on the average, as
10s. o£d. per week to female employees. The State
factory, paying all round over 155., which is the
highest average wage paid by any private factory,
could still do the whole work for but £693 more.
And this remarkable success has been achieved in
spite of the fact that the State factory is as yet an
infant; with that more perfect organisation which
will come from experience, and that specialisation
which is most of the secret of industrial success,
there can be hardly a doubt that even the £693 loss
will disappear. We should then have the State
supplying its own clothes as cheaply as Private
Enterprise supplied them, and, into the bargain,
paying all round the highest wages paid in any
factory, whereas some brands of Private Enter-
prise had been in the habit of clothing the police-
man by working the sweated factory; girl some-
thing more than full hours for about 10s. a week.
* *■ * !*
Yet, after all, what a poor little thing it is to
quarrel about, and have fearsome reports upon,
and build articles around—this as to whether a
few hundred pounds worth of work should be
done in Sydney in a private factory or one bossed
by the State. Even if it is proved, as it is, that all
the yarns about the enormous superiority of Pri-
vate Enterprise are rot, what a small thing is
gained compared with what might be: gained if
Australia employed its own workmen to do all the
work it needs done ! We quarrel as to whether
Mort’s Dock or the Fitzroy Dock, Weingott’s or
the State factory, shall have the paying out of
£59,000 or £60,000 a year ; and then the Common-
wealth imports £37,000,000 worth of foreign-made
goods, most of them goods which we could pro-
duce ourselves. Over the £50,000 or £60,000.
which our own workpeople would handle anyway,
we quarrel like Furies ; and George Reid says that
the question whether Mort’s Dock or the Fitzroy
Dock shall do the paying is too enormous a thing to
be mixed with anything else, and he must fight a
general election on that alone. But the £37,000,000,
which the foreigner handles, he can go on
handling. That isn’t worth fighting about. On
that question the “wdll preserve an
attitude of absolute neutrality.” In the struggle
of two small terriers over one small bone, the
valiant “anti-Socialistic” leader will take a great
interest; but he won’t interfere with the 10-ton
elephant whose lumbering feet will presently
crush out the life of both.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Poorly-Paid Public Service.
If the N.S.W. Commission on the Lands Depart-
ment gets to the bottom of the Lands scandals—
though that is by no means certain—one of its con-
clusions as to causes will probably be that the aver-
age civil servant is not sufficiently well paid to en-
sure his honesty and efficiency. That the majority
of civil servants are honest is true. That very many
of them are more efficient than the country has a
right to expect at the price is also true. But the fact
remains that, roughly, an employer can only expect
to get what he pays for, and the average Australian
Government does not pay for high honesty and
high efficiency in its Civil Service. (There are of
course grades of honesty just as there are grades
of efficiency. The men who would take direc t
bribes are few. The men who, from laxity of
principle or want of intelligence, would allow them-
selves to be influenced against their employers’
interests by social, friendly or other considerations
are many.) In the public service purely clerical
work is, as a rule, well paid. The man who
addresses envelopes and the man who, stumbling
stupidly along a whim-horse round indites those
wonderful communications—
I have the honor, by the direction of the Hon. the
Minister of Works, to acknowledge the receipt of your
communication of the 31st ultimo, having reference to
. . . . and to state that a reply thereto will be forwarded
to you in due course, this being merely an intimation that
your letter has been received, &c., &c., &c.—
are not sweated. They are not paid magnifi-
cently ; but their services are not magnificent.
In a properly-conducted civil service other and
more manly work would be found for them
than the weary unrolling of millions of yards of
useless red-tape. It is when a civil servant gets
above the mere clerk grade, when there is called
for, some general knowledge, some faculty of
decision and of independent thought, -Some firm


ness of character and acuteness of mind against im-
posture, that sweating begins.' Generally speak-
imr the civil service is the very poorest calling
for the man of high ability — administrative,
scientific or financial. The legal expert occa-
sionally commands a decent salary from the public
paymaster, but, excepting lawyers, the people
invariably sweat the brain-workers whom they
employ. As a natural result, the tendency is for
first-classmen to keep out of the service and for
those who are in it to become lax, and m some
few cases actually dishonest. As an example of
the estimation of brains in the public employ,
N.S. W. Public Service Board the other day circu-
larised the various departments as to ,the employ-
ment of a man to act as head of an agency to
advertise the State. He was to be a man of
originality and resource, well versed in the pas-
toral and agricultural and mining interests of the
State, in touch with financial circles, of good
address and sound j udgment, and so on ; and he
was to be paid £300 a year. Such a man would
be worth at the very least double that
sum to scores of private firms. The various
States do not secure economy by civil ser-
vice parsimony. The effect of low salaries
is inefficiency, multiplication of subordinates,
and a growth of laborious routine necessary to
reinforce low-grade brains, but which would be
quite superfluous to keen and decisive men.
When, say, £1,000,000 a year would keep a strong
service of 2500 men, each with a good wage, it
takes, say, £1,100,000 to pay a weak service of
5000 men, half of whose labors are made up of
useless routine work.
Not Half Awake.
Victorians wake up very slowly to the real busi-
ness of Bunt’s Closer Settlement “girl” ; but a few
facts which have lately come to the public show the
lady up for what she is. Bent, at the Farmers’
and Property Owners’ Association Conference,
blurted it out that the price of Wyuna was
£120,001. “ The first estate we shall acquire will
be for £120,000. and that we intend to pay for out
of revenue.” Next, Tait, before the Railway
Works Committee, jibbed at making any more
lines, and for the reason that “it was not advis-
able to spend public money in opening up new
areas until the areas alongside existing lines were
utilised as they ought to be.” On top of that
Bent again volunteers the statement, that, “as
£0,000,000 worth of land has already been
offered to the Commissioners, it is not neces-
sary to bother about the compulsory taking
of land at present.” Taking these nuggets of
facts as they stand, the first thing made plain is
that the owners of Wyuna get just about £5 an
acre for the whole of their estate. Wyuna, under
the Berry Land Tax, paid but £252 a year, and
therefore was not set down as either first or
second class. So far, no second-class land in Vic-
toria, in a block of 10,000 acres or upwards, has
brought more than £3 ss. per acre. Buyers
within the last three years have stopped
short of £3 ss. for Murray River properties,
Moira amongst others. Lake Bolec Station,
Western District, was sold for £2l2s. fid. ; Benam-
bool for £3 ; Trawalla, Ballarat, for £3. Wyuna
as sheep country is not better than, if as good as,
any of these, and therefore if its value is £5,
at least £2 of that value has been made
by the State-constructed railway and the enter-
prise of the adjacent settlers and townsfolk. The
State borrowed money to do its share of the bet-
terment ; the farmers and others put in their
graft and savings to make up the balance.
The Wyuna proprietors, therefore, are to get
two-fifths of their cheque for value which
has been created by State expenditure and
other people’s labor and enterprise. As with
this one lot, so. presumably it will be with all.
Commissioner Tait’s policy, which would be excel-
lent if there were a stiff land tax, makes this
boodler’s game practicable. “Vast areas of un-
utilised land are lying alongside existing railway
lines.” Of course they are. And they have been
kept unutilised in the expectation of such a de-
mand as is now made for land. The game is as
old as subdivision and settlement; but never be-
fore has the State taken a hand in playing the
boodler’s game—buying back its own improve-
ments, and paying cash down for value which it
has itself created. If this business is once under-
stood, the effects ought to be volcanic.
The N.S.W. Pest-breeders.
N.S. W. Fruitgrowers’ and Best-breeders’ League
has held its annual conference, and has decided
that it would be a dreadful thingif-Parhament were
to pass a Fruit Bests Act to insist on the crooked
grower being made straight and the dirty fruit
farm clean. Without his pests—his scales, spots,
bugs, flies, moths —the fruit-grower’s life, dele-
gates moaned, would not be worth living. Abolish
the pests, and “ three-fourths of the fruitgrowers
would go with them.” But, since codlin
moth and fruit fly had reached to a stage
at which they threatened to kill the dirty
orchards —dirt and all—the growers expressed
a reluctant willingness for the State to under-
take the work ,of subjugation in regard to
those two evils alone. All other evils had to be
left unchecked by State socialism until, pre-
sumably, they got so bad as to threaten to be
absolutely deadly, when perhaps the orchardst
will let the State take further action. It is all
very tragic, in spite of its touch of low comedy—
this grim grip of the orchardist on his dirt. He
loves his little insects—as did that ancient saint
who carefully replaced on his body any parasites
that dropped off—and will not be washed. If he is
he wails, he will die. Still, if the doctor
insists, he will let his left leg, which threatens
to part company with him, and his right hand,
which is also giving notice, be washed. But he
will not, must not, can not be washed com-
pletely. If he be so washed, he will die.
Nevertheless, the experiment should be tried.
The county of Cumberland is better fitted
to grow fruit than any patch of similar
area in the world. You can pick guavas
and raspberries, oranges and medlars, persimmons
and strawberries from the same acre. Almost any
fruit will grow and flourish. But the natural
penalty of such opulence is a liability to attack by
parasites. Freetrade brought foreign parasites to
re-inforce the local ones, and the county of Cum-
berland is the dirtiest as well as the richest fruit,
district m the world. Its dirt has been so long in
use and its dreadful insects so familiar that most
orchardists have come to look upon pest-culture
as an inseparable part of the industry, if not the
industry itself. But for the sake of the rest
of the State they must be cleansed of their dirt —
even if the bath is fatal.
History and the Child.
Discussion recently current shows that the Aus-
tralian child has very little chance of acquiring
from the history taught in the schools ideas at all
consistent with, or helpful to, Australian national
aspirations. Some have, in deploring this fact,
argued that the history lesson should be given a,
definite purpose in inculcating democratic views.
But that, of course, is as wrong as is the present
system of using it to preach .1 ingo-Imperialism.
The purpose of the historical lesson should be to
teach facts, and allow the pupils to form
their own conclusions from those facts. What
has to be aimed at principally is to make
the range of facts sufficiently wide, and to exclude,
as far as possible, text-books which turn the facts
to the propaganda of some particular cult of
thought. The latter is not easy, for it is the
delight of the historian to draw from his facts
conclusions to plead for his fads. But, at any rate,
it can be seen to that all the argument is not on
the same line, that the leanings of one writer are
balanced by attention to the contrary views of
another. At present most teaching in the schools
has a definite aim of instilling that rabid Jingoism
which has infected British public life lately. That
is altogether wrong. The first achievement of
historical study on the part of the Australian child
should be to learnthe history of his own country, and
after that the history of countries kindred to his
own in sentiment and in blood-ties. Unfortunatelv
Australian history is as yet somewhat dull of
incident. There has been no occasion in our
usually placid and quietly-progressive records for
the display of any torrential energy in revolt or
magnificent stability in defence. And it is occa-
sions, more than superhuman qualities, that make
men. What little of the storm and stress of life
has come to Australia lias not found her lacking
in patriotic sons. There was enough of energy
and heroism in the land to overcome the diffi-
culties of early exploration, to make violent
(sufficiently violent to be effective) protest against
the attempt to keep it as a sink for British
criminals, or as a sink for Asiatic immigrants, and,
at Eureka, to assert its right to self-govern-
ment. So far there has been no Washington,
or Hamilton, as in North America, no Bolivar,
as in South America, no deb Flue or Wali>
MANN, as in Switzerland. There has been
no actual need of t l ' 3m. What has been done,
as occasions arose, suggests that when the
call does come it will not remain unanswered.
But for the while it is necessary for Aus-
tralians to spend a good deal of admiration on the
heroes of other lands. And it is an unfortunate
fact that England, the country to which Australia
is most closely bound, and to whose history and
traditions it most naturally turns, of all great
countries lacks most markedly records such as
would Stimulate the democratic patriotism which
would be most useful to Australia. England
is a land of many great men, but they
were nearly all of a system and an epoch
and a political code foreign to the thought of the
present day. A crusading king or a warrior of
great strength to carry out rapacious schemes of
conquest—from them Australia can get inspiration
of no more value than from Alexander of Mace-
don or Pompey of Home. The one people’s Re-
publican movement in English history was so
disfigured by cant and cruelty that Cromwell s
name is impossible in the calendar of honor of a
democrat. Yet it is English history alone which
most Australians read ; for it even their own
brave little records are often neglected. The
records of republican France, of Switzerland,
or of the great English-speaking Republic
of America are practically unknown to nine-
tenths of the people of this Commonwealth.
Nevertheless, from the deeds therein recorded
Australian democracy might find splendid his-
torical inspiration. The memory of the prowess
of warrior kings fighting great battles and inflict-
ing great miseries over small points of dynastic eti-
quette is romantic enough, but of no political use to
a people working to freedom in the 20th century.
Probably the history of the United States of
America would, after the history of Australia, be
the most useful to the Australian child as bringing
him nearer to the facts of his own country.
American history conveys lessons in economics, in
constitutional law and on race questions, of
vital importance to Australia because touch-
ing problems which now face this continent. In a
well-regulated educational Syllabus the records of
Australia, Great Britain and Amierica would be
given equal prominence in the history class.
♦ —:
A Federal Department of Agriculture.
The name is poor, perhaps, but its main objects
express sound Commonwealth sense. The other
Prime Minister, Mr. M’Lean, marks these as
(1) legislating for uniformity in the standard of
food imports and exports for man and beast, and
(2) the dissemination through the High Commis-
sioner’s office of news regarding our products.
Some of the State Premiers are already barking
against the proposal. They see in it a fresh
assault on State frights. But all their barking
counts for little where the interests of all Australia
are concerned. Without a uniform standard of
quantity and quality the producers of the Common-
wealth can never appear at their best. Their
character in the world’s markets will be that of
their least conscientious member. In a recent
discussion in the British Commons upon alleged
short-weight jam exported from Victoria to
S’Africa, Victoria was Seldom mentioned. The
alleged light - weight commodity was called
Australian jam. The butter rejected by the
United States because it contained boracic
acid was described as Australian butter. The
good name of Australia is involved in the
exports of each State. To maintain that good
name is one of the duties of the Commonwealth
Parliament. Even though the States should
promise to mutually agree to a common standard,
there is no re ison why the Commonwealth should
wait for them to do so ; and if it waited there is
no certainty the standard would be observed.
Moreover the Commonwealth should not leave to
the States what it is its own duty to do. With
regard to imports the case is equally strong.
Foreign manufacturers of food stuffs will try
to get the better of the tariff by reducing
quantity or lowering quality. It is impossible
for the States, acting singly, to prevent
such importations. If the door of one
State be sufficiently guarded that of another will
not be. And, once the stuff enters any State, it is
easy for it to pass over the borders into all.
Here, again, States politicians talk of coming
together and framing a uniform law. It is enough
to say that for such purposes the States have
already come together, and are the Commonwealth.
The dissemination of information by the High
Commissioner’s office follows naturally. The
Commonwealth will, through that office, speak to
the markets as well as to the courts of the world,
telling what it can sell and buy, in what quanti-
ties and of what qualities. When the British
Government or any large buyer gives an order,
the High Commissioner will be able to say he
will execute the order and will guarantee quantity
and quality. It is clear that in such circumstances
foreign buyers will choose the High Commissioner’s
office as their medium, and just as clear that it
will be the ambition of the Australian producer to
conform to the established standard. There will
be little good in exporters sending out inferior
stuff on their own account, as buyers will in a
short time insist on seeing the Commonwealth
official brand on every article. Indeed, it would
not be going too far if the Common wealth Govern-
ment prevented the exportation of any food stuff
not passed by its local department. At the start,
that would seem harsh to some, but honest
exporters would realise its advantages, and soon it
would be insisted on by all. The commercial
reputation of Australia is in the hands of the
Commonwealth Government, and should be
guarded as a trust.
The Distributing Thief.
“ Ignotus ” on this point:—
Re Bulletin (13/4’05) on “the distributing thief." I
wanted some magnesium wire, and asked a friend in
Wellington (M L.), to go to a chemist and say that, as
the retail price in London was Is. 7d, I would give him
4s. 6d. an ounce and no more. Chemist told my friend
confidentially I had been hoaxed, and asked 12s. fid.
Finally he rang up the wholesale people, and my friend,
by some unexplained chance, overheard their quotation,
3s. in m,v opinion, our methods of distribution are in fault.
To remedy them, the first thing wanted, as in all cases of
seeking a remedy, is knowledge of facts. I suggest,
very diffidently, that it be made the business of the
Minister of Commerce to publish from time to
time lists of various articles showing as far as
possible, cost of manufacture, wholesale price abroad,
and wholesale price here, and local retail price.
Once I saw a beautiful rug and wanted to send it to Eng-
lahd as a present. I managed to trace it back as follows :
The mills (in Maoriland) got 255., the warehouseman got
325. fid., the retailer (up country) asked 455. The mills
would not sell to the retailer, nor the warehouseman to
me. But suppose we knew the facts, before we could
really do anything we must deal with the present system
of credit. I fully believe in “ business credit.” There is
a lot of available capital whose owners have not the know-
ledge to use it, and consequently must lend it. What I
object to is the ordinary shop credit which f call “ tick."
As to “secured” accounts, where there is a guarantee,
or even any careful inquiry, I see no harm. But my ex-
perience is that in country places anybody can run a
tick. I have known a farm hand, intemperate, living
on casual jobs of fencing, etc., run up a tick for luxuries
to the extent of £4O. I never knew a man get tick for
stamps, railway ticket or tram fare. Why, then,
for guns or accordeons V If a man wants goods he should
pay cash. If he wants to borrow he should go to a money-
lender. If you look at it understandingly, you will
see that the average storekeeper is a money-lender first
and a storekeeper second. When I go to him for an
accordeon on tick what does he do? First lends me a
sum. then sells me an accordeon for it. Now, it is quite
clear that, as he charges me nothing for the loan, he must
get a big extra percentage on the accordeon. I am con-
vinced that we could so simplify distribution as to
enormously cheapen goods, and so, also, . liberate a
number of new hands to engage in production, which
would further cheapen goods.
The Hew northern Bogey.
The Australian Tory lives mainly on bogeys. In
Queensland he thus managed to keep in office for
15 years or so, not through any merit of his own,
but simply by telling the people that the other
party was a Monster, all fangs and claws and no
conscience. But Philp at last became so lament-
ably weak that Queensland decided that it might
almost as well be torn to death as die of starva-
tion ; so Morgan and the Monster were trem-
blingly permitted a chance. And of all places in
the State the Monster was given the Treasury to
mind. Eighteen months have passed since then, and
there hasn’t been any riot. The Monster, when
he materialised, turned out to be just a plain,
practical, common-sense, shrewd Scotchman, who
wanted 20 shiliings-worth for the State’s sovereign,
and sometimes just a little more if he could get it
without inflicting hardship. Borrowing nothing,
shutting down hard on extravagance, and pur-
suing the nimble sixpence with such zeal as to
promise this year to turn a huge deficit (£101,341
in Phtlp’s last year) into a surplus, he was so
utterly unlike what the Boodle party had
pictured him that even commercial Queensland
is satisfied, and more than satisfied. All
its old alarms are dead. It knows now
that it was swindled for years—swindled out of its
senses by bogey-yarns. The old bogey having
been nicely killed and buried, the Queensland
Tory finds it therefore necessary to his existence
to invent another ; and it turns up in the Better-
ment Tax, for which Kidston, the limb of the
Monster who has been at the Treasury, is under-
stood to have a peculiar affection. Premier
Morgan, on the other hand, is said to have no
great love for it; yet it is represented as being
such an infamous and monstrous thing that even
if he loves it ever so little, it is sufficient
to damn him with his own agricultural
constituency and with every other in the
country. But surely Queensland has been too
much fooled in the past to take any more bogeys
out of the same bogey-mill on trust. It needs for
the future to see what the animal is stuffed with.
The farmer especially needs to see —for it is the
farmer whom they want to make the special fool
of this time. He is told that he will be the chief
sufferer by the tax. That, of course, is untrue.
The chief sufferers will be the man, or the syndi-
cate, or the mortgagee co. that is holding land 101
a rise, and not x:e man who is tilling it tor a
harvest. When the public spends money to
build a railway, up goes the price of the land
That extra value clearly belongs to the public,
and some of it ought to be used to pay for the
railway. Under present arrangements the syndi-
cate. pockets the extra value, and the farmer and
the other members of the public pay for the rail-
way no matter where they may be. Ihe farmer
may be 500 miles from the railway, and yet he is
taxed to pay interest and keep it going. The Better-
ment Tax will partly stop that; and the farmer,
who has suffered more from land-grabbing sharks
than anybody else, will agree that it ought to be
stopped. If his own property is enhanced m
value, he will be content to pay for
that service, just as he is content _ to
pay for any other service. If it isn’t
enhanced, he will not pay anything. That
is as absolutely fair as any tax can be. And,
after all, it is not the agricultural land which
appreciates most. The railway line once open,
farmers’ own land remains approximately at the
same price year after year —that is, so long as it
is used for farming, and has no other use. It is
city land which rises to dizzy boom heights ; and,
in the long run, the farmer and other producers
have to pay for that, too. If the grain-merchant
has to pay exorbitant rent to the landlord, per-
haps an absentee, it has to come out of the price
of wheat. The tax is a tax on the speculator, on
the do-nothing, on the man who merely sits down
and waits while others bring grist to him ; and
that the Queensland Boodler should try to rouse
up the producer against it shows how desperately
hard-up the Boodler is for material to make
a bogey with.
The Snoozing State.
S. Australia is due for a general election before
the end of the month ; and it threatens to be just
about as unsatisfactory as a general election well
can be. The State has got into a condition in
which it seems to think that nothing matters
much so long as its Parliament is “respectable.”
Probably the arrival of the woman-voter, who
hasn’t yet become quite a political student, has
had most to do with this. The “nice man” who
can cut a satisfactory figure at tea meetings and
the like is swallowed wholesale, on the ground
that “he wouldn’t do anything wrong.” Whether
he will do anything right doesn’t count.
The consequence is a generation of political
neuters, very well represented by the supposedly
democratic Advertiser, which hasn’t a fight
in it. It ventures democratic ideas occasionally,
but it never takes its coat off to battle for them.
Jenkins, clever book-canvasser, knew his public;
he just tickled their ears, never alarmed them,
smiled on everybody—and then took the “ stiddy
job” of Agent-General. His coalition with the
other side didn’t seem to these people anything
out of the way. Why shouldn’t Mr. Jenkins and
Mr. Darling stand in a Cabinet together, just
as well as they could stand on a plat-
form together after a Sunday-school tea-meeting ?
No condition could well be more deplorable than
all this, from the democratic point of view. For
where there is no fighting, there is no progress.
The tendency is to slip back all the time. The line of
least resistance runs towards rot and decay.
Jenkins was an instance of that—Jenkins who
started as the colleague of Kingston and ended
virtually as the colleague of John Darling.
Butler in the same way has slipped back from
being a supporter of a household franchise for the
Council to being a supporter of a £2O residential
qualification. So we have the sorry spectacle of a
State drifting along without ideals, and turning
listlessly from the few men who are struggling to
rouse it to earnestness.

Thus Rev. H. S. Buntine, at the Presbyterian
Fellowship Unions’ Convention (Melb.), the other
day
When the clause in the Postal Bill affecting “ Tatter-
Sacl's ” (sweeps) was going- through Parliament, one of
the members told him that, if any representative was
willing to sell his vote on three questions, one of which
was “'TatTersall’s,” he could get £IOOO for it. For the
credit of the Commonwealth let it be said that there were
not half-a-dozen members who could be bought even at
that price.
It is due now to the Rev. Buntine to tell: What
were the other two questions ? Who were the
persons who offered bribes concerning them ?
Who were the five (or less) members whop as the
Rev. Buntine infers, were bribed by “Tatter-
sall” in respect of the Postal Bill.' 1 Who was
the member who gave him this information,
and why has he kept his knowledge to him-
self all this time? If the Rev. Buntine
doesn’t answer these questions fairly and frankly
of his own accord, it will be the duty of the
Federal Parliament to make him. His charges
must be pinned down definitely, and either proved
to be slanders or carried to tlieir logical end by
the punishment of the guilty politicians.
Some ten or eleven years ago an attempt was
made to exchange a large portion of the foreshores
at Cremorne Point, Sydney, for an area of land on
the surmounting ridge which belonged to the late
James Milson, then alive—the excuse being that
the latter would some day be needed for a public
park. The transaction was, however, not com-
pleted owing to the vigilance of Alderman E. M.
Clark, and a perfect howl of public indigna-
tion went up when it was known that
the foreshores were wanted for wharfage
and water access to the proposed Sydney
Colliery, whose promoters were then boring
for coal,- at public expense, on the promontory.
After this attempt to alienate the foreshores was
defeated, the colliery shaft was put down at Bal-
main', and the matter died out of public mind.
But it has recently been resuscitated by the North
Sydney Council—curiously enough on the motion
of Alderman E. M. Clark, no longer in Parlia-
ment —which recently carried a motion in favor
of the exchange being made. What is behind this
attempt to alienate the people’s heritage is not
now apparent, but it is rather strange that it
should be backed up by Alderman Clark, who
years ago defeated a similar endeavor, and by the
North Sydney Council, which for years has been
advocating the preservation of public water
frontages, and the resumption of many of those
that have been alienated.

“ C.E.D.” from a big N.S.W. inside town :
Chief reason Australians do not buy more of their home-
made tweeds and other woollen goods is that the whole-
sale merchants, and through them the retailers, won’t or
don’t offer them. Being an Australian, I have been used
to purchasing Australian tweeds ; but when requiring
anew suit here, I inquired for Australian serge and
tweed. As usual, was informed that they did
not stock them. Insisted, and at last patterns
were obtained of a Ballarat serge; and business re-
sulted. Wife wanted some flannel; but, as they only
stock “ imported,” was compelled to delay the purchase
until I went to Melbourne last week. Purchase of that
dozen of flannel was enough to break a Protectionist’s
heart, for I .went from shop to shop stipulating that it
must be Australian manufacture, having almost to insult
shop-walkers who rushed when that magic word “Sign ”
“Bring Out Your Dead.”
[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
During the height of the plague, men bearing torches
went through the streets at night crying, “Bring out
your dead.” —History of the London Playue.
Ouu cities throng with life ; our streets
Have never heard those wheels of woe ;
Yet in our land a voice repeats
To-day that cry of long ago,
Sadly and solemnly and slow—
“Bring out your dead!” “Bring out your dead!”
“ Bring out your dead ! ” nor fear the rot
And reek of them, be strong, be bold ;
Bring out each damned Iscariot
That sells his brother man for gold,
To death and miseries untold—
“Bring out your dead !” “Bring out your dead !”
“ Bring out your dead ! ” In fear bring forth
The putrefying castes and creeds,
The frothy mouthings, nothing worth,
The sleek hypocrisy that breeds
A wealth of words, a dearth of deeds —
“ Bring out your dead ! ” “ Bring out your dead ! ”
“Bring out your dead !” The dead of State,
The coward hearts, the party rule,
The lies of grossness, power elate,
That stun the wise and dupe the fool,
And bring the truth to ridicule—
“ Bring out your dead! ” “ Bring out your dead! ”
“Bring out your dead !” The sins that fret
Like ceaseless maggots at the soul;
The unchecked passions that beget
Strong waves of lust that over-roll
In fiercest tumult, all control.
God’s burial agent is abroad—
The wheels groan loud, His torch flares red ;
The grave is diggSd in the sod—
“ Bring out your dead! ” “ Bring out your dead!”

Mr. George Edwardes, of London Gaiety
fame, is reported to be “fearful ” of the decay of
musical comedy. “Hopeful” would be a better
word. Musical comedy has had a fair innings in
Australia as well as London, and it will denote a
reformation in the taste of theatre goers if they
demand productions with more of music and less
of farce. With the growth of the Gaiety perform-
ances fostered by Mr. Edwardes to suit the peculiar
powers of the principal artists on whom he has
chosen to rely, music has been squeezed more and
more out of the bill of fare, and the comic element
has been enlarged until its preponderance has be-
come quite inordinate. Of late the principal low
comedian has practically filled the leading role.
Of music proper there has been little or none, and
in its place there has been degeneracy into the
comic song with the inevitable tendency to sug-
gestiveness. The redeeming feature has been the
leaven of clever dancing; but in connection with
the last London Gaiety co. to visit Australia, it
will be remembered that even this was expunged,
and reliance had to be placed entirely upon one
gifted comedian, whose specialty was the repre-
sentation of the shallow-pated lordling in all his
drivelling idiocy.
#
The popularity of musical comedy has
experienced a heavy slump in London, and the
cause thereof is said to be the monotonous irrele-
vancy of the variety business introduced into the
second act. Musical comedy is usually a thea-
trical show for 20 minutes, and a music-hall show for
the rest of the time. The story drops into
oblivion, the characters lose their interest for
the public, if they ever had any, and the second
act is a succession of loose items, not as bright or
as cleverly performed as the best music-hall stuff.
The public having “tumbled” to the truth, it
will be necessary for theatre-managers to preserve
their entertainments of the gay and frisky class
from odious comparison with the “turns” at the
’alls. The author who constructs the first act
must be permitted to have his way in the second
act. Under the new, discredited system of musi-
cal-variety comedy, the author is not respon-
sible for the second act. He merely sketches in a
little dialogue, leaving a number of gaps to be
filled with “business” that makes him squirm as
he sits in front- and sees it perpetrated. The
public were supposed to enjoy this extraneous
hotch-potch in the second act, and a noisy
minority of them certainly laughed at it. Now
they are supposed to be tired. It’s time they
were.

If in Australia anybody proposed to run a
State theatre, or a State-subsidised theatre,
George Reid would certainly jot down the fact as
proof of the socialistic degradation to which Aus-
tralia, of all countries in the world, had descended.
Yet ‘in England, which this awful blight of
Socialism isn’t supposed to afflict, the proposal is
being calmly discussed, and looks like coming off.
And, of course, like most well-directed State-help,
it will do good. Where particularly, as in Russia,
the theatre subsidy is graduated so as to encourage
native dramas and operas, a national, as well as a
general educational, purpose is served. The
British Government does not subsidise, and the
only opera Britain gets, except on rare occa-
sions, is foreign. The conductors are foreign, the
principals for the main part are foreign, the
orchestras are mostly foreign. On the other hand,
Italy subsidises over 400 theatres, the annual
allowances running from £2O to £BOOO. Germany
pays one opera house £54,000 per year, and
another £20,000. Austria is similarly liberal.
The French Govt, subsidises opera in Paris only,
but the municipalities do it in the outer districts.
The subsidy is not so much more money uncondi-
tionally dropped into the pockets of the pro-
prietors. The Government, when arranging the
subsidy, takes into account the character of the
performance—the more artistic and elevating the
performance, the higher the subsidy—and fixes the
scale of charges for the public. It is the public
that financially gains by the subsidy, though the
performers gain, too, bv having constant local
occupation. The proprietors do not make as
much as the private-enterprise proprietor while he
is successful, but they are guaranteed against
disaster.
Kara, the juggler, having fallen ill of
appendicitis, manager Rickards gets into the large
hole thus made in the Tivoli bill, and sings some-
thing new in coster clothes ; but this paper had to
go to press too soon to see the buttons this week.
The show has been strengthened by Robins,
described with inaccuracy as an original black and
white comedian, and a Spanish dancing lady with
large claims to beauty. And the advts. begin to
hint at a brief return visit of the inimitable and
briefer Tich.

Sydney won’t have to wait past Saturday
for “The Cingalee.” The picturesque stranger

“ If I Were King ” —a drama of proved

“Skirt Dancer,” at the Criterion, is a
fixed theatrical deposit for the present. A little

increased the value of the piece.

In addition to the aerial flights of the Her-
berts, and the jumping feats of Playmate, Fitz-
geralds are just now showing the two poles of
physical development. The bulky, broad-beamed
Japs represent the one extreme of athleticism, in
which the main object is to acquire the slipperi-
ness of the eel; while Cameron and Johnstone
represent the other, in which the cultivation of
vast muscular power is the objective. It is the old
story of the East and the West again. Richard, the
Lion Heart, laid a bar of iron on the floor, and with
one blow of his sword (which, by the way, was made
by day labor) shore it in two. Saladin tossed a
cushion into the air, and with a sweep of his scimi-
tar divided it in the centre. At heaving the 161 b.
shot and tossing 561bs. of iron about the big Scotch-
men are seen at their best.

Among the Japanese wrestlers at Fitz-
gerald’s circus is Otokojima, who understands
ju-jitsu. For some time he has been teaching
strong man Professor Gordon the ju-jitsu holds
and falls, and during last week, two private exhi-
bitions have been given of the “ game.” Game is
hardly a word for ju-jitsu. It is murderous
assault raised to a scienoe. A bout of ju-jitsu
entered into as a sport ends when one of
the parties indicates that he surrenders; no
sort of “fall” counts, the beaten man
must surrender. The object of the ju-jitsu
man, therefore, is to secure such a hold on
his opponent (all holds are legal) that he
can strangle him, or tear a piece off him, or break
one of his limbs. When two men who know the
tricks, but are resolved not to push an advantage
to the point of murder or mutilation, are engaged
in a bout, the sport is intensely exciting. If A has
a strangle hold on B, B perhaps is in a position of
being able to tear off A’s big toe, and essays to do
so. If he is at all successful, A decides to post-
pone the strangling till another occasion, and they
grapple again, intent on homicidal grips. Dis-
plays of ju-jitsu—under, of course, friendly con-
test conditions—will shortly be made a feature of
the circus programme.
* # * *
“The Best of Friends,” at Melb. Royal, has
the unique distinction of being a melodrama which
ends in silence. There are no last words to bring
the curtain down. The body of a third-rate villain
falls through space without pausing to explain
how it happened. He is suspected of having
dropped by accident, but he was possibly hurled
from the unseen dome of Bland Holt’s circus
building by an invisible agency. In any case, he
doesn’t matter much. The crowd at Holt’s circus
are for the most part an unemotional people, who
view this catastrophe with stony indifference.
Nothing interests them. Some of their animated
neighbors appear to be enjoying the performance
as far as it goes, but the thoughts of the motionless
majority are evidently far away. And yet the
voice of a ring-master, or somebody, implores them
to preserve perfect order whilst the Dook’s long-
lost granddaughter is dangling at the end of a
rope. As though they ever talked !

At Her Majesty’s the Andrew Mack Co.
has played “Tom Moore” for three weeks, and
will give that genial balladrama a rest after
Friday. Mack has a number of other dramas to
stage during the season, and the foremost of these
others is “The Way to Kenmare,” billed for
Saturday.

A considerable change in the programme
at the Opera House next Saturday. To-night
(Thursday) is the last of Little Tich, and to-
morrow brings sundry other people to the end of
their present tether. Meanwhile, the one new
person on the Rickards job is Dryden, who has a
tuneful voice and a poor assortment of songs.
His third song is mainly talk to the effect that he
is Sydney Carton, waiting to be guillotined.
Finally, he goes away to get chopped, whereupon
his admirers applaud rather warmly.
The gaudy tragedy of “Theodora” con-
tinues to deserve public respect at Melbourne
Princess’s. A large percentage of the public re-
spects it all the more for not knowing what place
and period in history Theodora and Justinian be-
long to. The name Belisarius seems to remind
them of a modern racehorse, but their ideas about
Byzantium are very vague, and the incidental bar-
barian who hangs around the court winking at
Mrs. Belisarius is a pretty general subject for
amazement. An explanatory footnote on the pro-
gramme would rob the performance of a certain
element of impressive mystery.

At Adelaide Royal, an Anderson Co. has
been instructing the public in the art of sister-
poisoning and racehorse-nobbling. “ The Favor-
ite” has now made way for “Between Two
Women.” The Exhibition of Manufactures has
closed after six weeks of solid success, with con-
certs most evenings. A strong amateur co. has
been playing “Sweet Lavender” and “One
Summer’s Day ” to audiences which found the
somewhat overstrained sentiment of those pieces
acceptable, and signified the same in the usual
manner,
Theodora was a scorcher, very sultry, very warm,
Like a breathless summer noontide when the
clouds foretell a storm,
In her youth a circus-rider, a performer in the
ring
She became the lawful lady of a craven-hearted
Ring-
Yea, the partner fair and flighty
Of a ruler high and mighty
Who was erst a royal puppet if she chose to pull
the string.
Now, to keep him in subjection should he strive
to break away
Theodora ordered “philtre ” from a sorceress one
day.
“When my hubby’s flower of passion shows a
tendency to die
I will drop a dose of philtre in his porridge or his
pie :
Then he’ll be my true adorer
As before,” quoth Theodora,
“ And I’ll silence his suspicions with my cus-
tomary lie.”
A Greek, the young Andreas, was the lady’s
dearest “boy”;
She hugged him hard and often with a great, un-
holy joy.
He thought the wife a widow, for he didn’t know
her name,
And she mid she was a widow, flitting mothlike
round the flame;
But at last he learned the “ widdy ”
Was the Empress, gay and giddy,
And he looked for words to tell her what he
thought about her sh-a-ame.
Theodora let him curse her. He said “ blanky,”
likewise “dam.”
She listened—and she loved him —she was meek as
Mary’s lamb.
She had stood no cheek and nonsense from His
Majesty the King;
But the insults of Andreas —they were quite
another thing.
Though the language of a lover
Shake the Heavens high above her,
Yet a woman can forgive it (Love’s a doosid funny
thing).
She gave her “ boy ” some philtre, and it turned
his tummy sick,
Eor the sorceress had played her, O, a nasty low-
down trick.
The draught, that should have made him kind and
tender once again,
Served to carry off Andreas in an agony of pain.
The Greek she’d thought to cherish
Did a brief dramatic perish ;
By the hand of Theodora he had certainly been
slain.
Then the King, her husband, caught her weeping
sadly o’er the dead.
And she fell from his affections like a heavy lump
of lead.
He pulled the string in this case, and it left a
cruel mark
On the throat of Theodora when it left her stiff
and stark.
Note the moral in this story,
In this story, short and gory,
Of a Queen who gallivanted round the city after
dark :
Kings may go and get a skinful
And be altogether sinful
But a Queen, a Queen, must not go gallivanting
after dark.
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Camperdown, one of the forty-odd municipali-
ties which keep forty-odd cupboards and town halls and
bits of unnecessary frill around Sydney, and burn gas at
forty-odd unnecessary meetings, at which they oall one
another “ Mr. Mayor ” and “ Mr. Alderman,” had the tail-
end of a recent heavy rainstorm. The streets were in a
wretched state before, but the flood washed more holes in
them, so that now when you go down some Camperdown
roads in the dark you take risks with your life. The
council met, as usual, some time after the storm and had
the chasms reported to it; and it sighed and said
it was very sorry, but that it had a bailiff on the
premises, and was merely a figure-head itself. The
bailiff, it seems, has been in for about three years; he
handles all the money, and when the council wants a
load or two of stones tipped into a particularly deep
chasm, it has to go to the bailiff in a very respectful way,
and ask him if he would spare a few shillings out of the
rates to do the job. Most often he replies that Cohen is
calling, and he’s very sorry, but he can’t oblige. Between
sighs at the last council meeting aldermen told one
another that, though the place was going from
bad to worse, and no public works were done,
and property was losing its value, still the debt
had increased by £3600 under the bailiff’s dispensation ;
and the future was one big gloomy fog, without a break
in it. Yet Camperdown only did just what the States
are doing—it borrowed, and forgot that debt is a much
more vigorous thing than public works, and is just as
flourishing as ever even when the works are in a state of
decay. It is a lamentable illustration of a concern which
gaily sailed into debt, and then wouldn’t tax itself to
provide a sinking fund ; and now it has to take its meals
with the bailiff, and it is finding out that a bailiff is poor
company.

Of the amount shown as written off, &c., £19,276 goes to
depreciation reserve, which now amounts to £227,155 ;
this is apparently not invested separately—in other
words, the depreciation reserve is represented by as solid
securities as the assurance fund, which now amounts to
£20,567,135. During the past year this depreciation
reserve has been drawn upon to the extent of £49,950,
while profit and loss has been charged direct with another
£17,984. Together this looks a pretty large shrinkage for
a single year, though, after all, it is barely more than
i p.c. on the total assets. And £lO,OOO of that is due to
further writing down premises.
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1895 ~ £8 8 8 per cent. 1900 .. £9 0 6 per cent.
1896.. 818 1 „ 1901.. 810 0 „

1898 .. 9 4 0 „ 1903 .. 817 0 „
1899 .. 919 8 „ 1904 .. 816 7 „
On the total income this shows a slight reduction. But
on premium income alone the year’s rate is £l3 6s. 9d.
against £l3 6s. 2d. in 1903. With the growth of funds,
and the increase of investments, the management of
which costs comparatively little, there ought to be a
steady reduction in expense rate, on the total income
basis at any rate. For 1894 the interest was £699,107;
for last year, £906,394. The expense of managing
investments to produce the extra £207,287 of interest was
not great (a trustee co. might do it for 1£ per cent.) ; yet
on total income the expense-rate has moved up from £8
7s. in 1894 to £8 16s. 7d. in 1904. Most of this increase
was no doubt due to increased taxation ; but the question
is whether, in view of the growth of cheaply-earned
interest, there should have been any increase at all.
Renewal premiums cost much less to collect than first
premiums, and there were £1,609,173 of such premiums
last year against £1,166,416 in 1894 ; yet the present
expenses on total premiums amount to £l3 6s. 9d. per
cent., whereas in 1894 they amounted to only £l2 18s. sd.
per cent. Evidently the" business is a good deal more
costly than it was ;' though probably the new industrial
department, by providing an opening for some of the
senior officers, and sharing the services and salaries of
others, may stop the present upward movement.

Last year there was a satisfactory movement —a result of
the recent dearness of money during the drought. But the
tendency seems the other way again now ; so that it is
almost too much to hope that the upward movement will
continue. Even now, however, it is an excellent rate ;
the management’s prudent policy of steadily writing down
premises and other assets (the furniture item wholly dis-
appeared some years ago) is no doubt partly responsible
for these first-rate figures. The assets have been at
various periods distributed in this way :

The assets include some other small items; while the
outstanding premiums not shown above are approximately
balanced by outstanding claims. The disposition of the
assets has therefore moved as follows: —

In 1894 the earnings were £5 11s. lOd. p.c. ; but against
the shrinkage which has occurred since then set the
splendid increase in public (including municipal) secur-
ties ; there cannot be a doubt that the society has gained
immensely in safety, and that is the big point in connec-
tion with a life office.
The valuation shows a surplus of £704,677, of
which £618,486 is available, providing reversionary
bonuses of about £1,200,000. Policies in force number
190,259, assuring £53,786,864, in addition to £49,474 of
annuities. One further comparison, showing the amount

Australia may be “going to the do B' s ” ; but ° om P^ e
surrenders and forfeitures for 1894 with those for 1904, and
you won’t find much to support the argument. Probably
the public knows better now than it did even 10 years ago
what a splendid concern the A.M.P. is, and is willing to
make more sacrifices to keep a share in it; but, even
admitting that, it looks as though the A.M.P. s clientele
is much less hard-up than it was before this awful social-
istic party came on the scene.

Some Sydney Daily Telegraph shares have
been on the market lately, with sales at £63. This makes
the market value of the property £693,000. The return
on that only looks like 3? per cent. ; but for years the co.
has been issuing bonus shares at par (in five years 5000
have been issued), and the hope that they will keep that
pleasant little process going makes all the difference.

The total funds now amount to £1,868,774, of which
£819,791 has been added during the past ten years.
The society had an abnormal year in 1903, and
has not been able to live up to it; but comparing the
figures with those of previous years they are satisfactory
enough. The expense rate is, certainly, above the aver-
age of the previous five years:—
Expenses Compared with Total Revenue.
1895 ..£l9 10 2 per cent. 1900 ..£2O 11 2 per cent.
1896 .. 21 311 „ „ 1901 .. 19 19 3 „ „

1899 .. 18 17 10 „ „ 1904 .. 19 19 7 „ „
A few pence of the increase is due to quinquennial investi-
gation expenses, but mainly it is due to a small growth in
almost every line of expenditure. On premium income
alone the expense-rate was £26 17s. Bd. per cent. Taking
the figures arrived at on either basis, there is a good deal
of room for improvement. In 1903, on the total-income
basis, the M.L.A. reached fourth place among Australian
offices ; for last year, it looks as though it may be seventh.
With the growth of funds and business there ought to be
a gradual reduction in expenses; but in a good many
cases the thing that ought to be isn’t. In this respect,
the M.L.A. isn’t worse than, if it is as bad as, some others.
Interest earnings move a point the good way :

In 1903 there were outstanding liabilities of £14,074
against these funds ;in 1904, £20,641. The interest rate
is close up to the average of Australasian offices—
perhaps a few pence under. . But while of these
offices’ aggregrate funds 64 p.c. is out on mort-
gage and policy loans, the M.L.A. has only
58? p.c. out on those usually high-rate securities.
On the other hand, its holding of freeholds is consider-
ably above the average ; and insurance co.’s can’t generally
show a good rate from that class of investment. Thus
the M.L.A. has rather less than the average of securities
which usually show the highest rate, and rather more of
the average of those securities which usually show the
lowest rale ; and still its earnings are very nearly up to
the average. This seems to indicate very good manage-
ment —for even poor management can show a high rate
if it handles only high-rate, risky business. But the in-
crease of cash, &c., seems to indicate also that the society,
like most others with capital at command, has a difficulty
in finding an outlet for it at recent rates. As before
remarked, it is about up to all these people to first
jump hard on the Stinking Fish crowd, and then try
and instil into Australians a bit more confidence
in their country. While they encourage people to howl
it down, there won’t ever be any demand for capital. And
it won’t be only the banks that will suffer. The chicken
will come home to roost in the shape of diminished insur-
ance bonuses, too.
The M.L.A. finds it has £124,553 to divide in
bonuses for the past five years. The valuation has been
partly made on a 3 per cent, basis, using a new “ Ordinary
male” mortality-expectation table. The society came
down from 4 to 3? per cent. (“ Healthy male” table) five
years ago, and the present is a further small move towards
increased safety.

This strikingly-solid institution, whose only fault (or
thereabouts) is that it is an absentee, has felt the back-
wasb which has reduced by a little the profits of most of
the banks. In the bad, droughty times, when money
was tight, rates for deposits were put up 1 per cent., and
for advances 2 per cent, or more ; and, as many people
had to borrow, the hanks, on the ground that they were
taking extra-big risks, extracted fine profits. As it
happens, two extra-good wheat and wool harvests whit-
tled away the risk, made more money available, and
reduced the call for advances ; and the figures show the
consequences. The Australasia’s capital is £1,600,000;
on that and reserves, profits have moved :

The steady reduction of the already small premises ac-
count is one of the most striking features about this bank.
Bills in circulation include “sundry liabilities,” which
probably take in the bank’s inner reserve; while the
steady writing-down of properties, doubtless below their
value in some cases, provides what is practically another re-
serve. The decreased advances and increased deposits are
represented wholly by liquid assets in the shape of money
at call or short notice (£1,470,039 against £295,000 twelve
months ago)—held in London, no doubt, and earning at
most 2 per cent., which is quite enough to account for the
profit shrinkage. But, notwithstanding the shrinkage,
the Australasia stands alongside the Bank of Westralia at
the top of the list of Australian banks in this matter of
earnings per cent, of shareholders’ funds.

The directors report a profit of £171,362 ; but from this
£16,045 is to be written off, being applied to replacement
and depreciation. The fund for this purpose has been
stationary for some years ; plant additions, &c., have been
mostly paid for but of revenue, which has amounted to a
corresponding writing-down of existing assets. Now,
however, with no additions, &c., in progress, this most
conservatively-managed co. goes back to the old plan and
writes something off the value of existing mills, &c. As
to the capacity of the co. to pay more than the regular 10
per cent., it is impossible to tell from the published
accounts how much really was earned prior to this last
half-year—in other words, how much, in addition to the
amounts stated, was netted, but was spent on refineries,
lands, plant, &0., and written off. No doubt, however, a
very considerable part of the extra profit shown during
the past half-year arises, not from spending and writing-
off less, but from the higher price realised for sugar ; and
there is no telling how long that will last, though as an
artificial movement it isn’t likely to be permanent.
Further, last season’s sugar crop was unusually heavy,
which was in the co.’s favor also. But as often remarked,
the published accounts are not much of a guide asto
what the co. is really capable of doing ; and the ease with
which the c,o. shows a 60 p.c. increase when it wants to
do a little celebrating is at least significant. And it is
more significant still if, as the chairman alleges, the co.
“ has obtained no advantage at all from the higher prices
in respect of raw sugar purchased in Q., N.S.W. and Fiji.”

There have not been many more sorrowful busi-
nesses than that of meat-freezing in Australia dur-
ing the past few years ; the co.’s mostly were projected
at a time when the country was over-stocked,
and prices were poor; but drought and rabbits (which
wouldn’t have mattered so much but for the overstocking)
got to work ahead of the freezers and the digesters ; and
when the co.’s have struggled through at all it has nearly
always been because the stock-owners have subsidised
them as a handy means of keeping the market firm.
Next year this unfortunate co., whose own capital is now
£19,584, has £15,000 of debentures falling due; but,
partly by calling up capital (£7022 in two years), it has,
in spite of its losses, reduced its overdraft from £6305 to
£1927, and its trade debts from £656 to £ll9. But it has
not been able to write anything off for depreciation of
plant, &c.—the amount shown as written off last year
was a small sum spent on repairs.
* * * *
In addition to the Riverina Frozen Meat Co.,
there is the Riverina Chilled Meat Co., which has been
even more disastrous. After it had itself struggled
unsuccessfully for some years with the works at Naran-
dera (N.S.W.), it leased them to the Pastoral Finance
Association ; when that co. wouldn’t renew, the Rose-
warne Packing Co. tried them, and failed ; and now they
have been leased by a Wagga speculator, who is turning
them from chilling to freezing works, with an eye not so
much to mutton as to rabbits.

This sad society, whose capital used to be £300,000, has
now a paid capital of £45,589. Shareholders’ reserves
(only made possible by the forfeiture of written-down
capital) are £14,788 ; the liabilities to the public consist
of deposits £35,120, and sundries £4089. Twelve months
ago deposits were £33,258, overdraft £2422 (now wiped
out), and sundries £4939. Against present liabilities co.
has £40,371 of advances, £2082 due on land-purchases,
£54,013 of mostly-foreclosed properties (apparently written
down from £107,530 by means of forfeited capital), £2589
of cash, and a few pounds in furniture, &c. How the
heavy swag of properties still carried will pan out no man
can say; but current business has looked up con-
siderably the society has paid less interest
and earned more than in the previous year, is
quit of its overdraft, and but for the awful heritage from
Queensland’s drunk period might look forward with some
hope to the future. And even with that handicap a few
years more of clean living - and hard work may land it on
firm ground. Certainly clean living and boom-values in
land don’t run together ; so a society which can’t easily
get back to its old place except through a land boom
hasn’t so much to hope from the present healthy trend of
things up North as most others have. And that’s a good
thing for the country if a rough thing for the shareholders.
* * * *
One mostly-overlooked cause of the present pro-
sperity of Broken Hill co.’s is the reduction in foreign
returning-charges (the deductions from the market value
of metal contents made by ore-buyers to cover freight,
insurance, smelting, &c.). This accounts for the much
greater improvement in figures relating to South, British,
and North, which sell their concentrates, than to B.H-
Prop., which smelts its own. A drop of 12s. per ton of
concentrates in foreign charges is equal to a rise of £1 per
ton of lead. This dependence upon the foreigner is, of
course, risky; and it is pretty certain that, before long,
he will send up the charges to the old rate. The knock-
out of Australian competition (the Dapto works are closed
already) will tend that way. This is one considerable
speck on Broken Hill’s horizon, though so far the market
doesn’t seem to have taken it into account.

The position for the past two years as thus represented
seems to call for some explanation. Assets were re-
valued during 1903, and a deficiency of £9662 was
disclosed; £5OOO of this was written off from the
reserve fund, and the balance was temporarily carried for-
ward as an asset. In the past year a further £136 has been
added to this deficiency “asset.” In the foregoing, of
course, the whole amount is shown as written off. The
profit and loss credit (£525) has also been turned into
a debit of £3670 ; this is said to be due to the old drought
and the lack of loading in the back-country. Directors,
who have cut down expenses hard (including, by the way,
repairs), are hopeful; but if co. has another bad year,
there should be no alternative but to write down capital.
The co. formerly paid divs. that were not earned ; now,
though it doubtless sinned in ignorance, it must atone.
And the atonement comes the harder because the over-
draft, £6807 twelve months ago, is up to £9297 now'.

Broken Hill Junction North had its half-yearly
meeting in Melbourne last Friday. Directors proposed
to alter the articles and provide for monthly calls;
Broken Hill shareholders carried an amendment against
them, that the meeting be adjourned for six weeks.
Chairman Sheppard said, if this were carried, the two
new Broken Hill directors would have to take the
responsibility of keeping things going. The obvious duty
of chairman and the old members of the board was to
resign, shareholders having taken the management out of
their hands. To talk of two directors, who commanded a
majority of the shareholders, having to accept the respon-
sibility for what the shareholders decided upon was absurd.
First result of the change in the board was that the
trouble with the Aus. Metal Co. (which put in the new
plant) was fixed up, and Ullrich, the Metal Co.’s manager,
takes charge of the new mill. Co. has been losing, it is
alleged, £4OO a week lately, and is now over £5OOO to the
bad on profit and loss account; but Broken Hill share-
holders are most sanguine that the new plant can be made
to show a profit almost at once if it is handled right.
All the same, it is worth remembering that, though the
Metal Co. has been treating some stuff successfully for
years, it has only handled one very little lot of the Junc-
tion North’s rhodonite ; so that the success of the process
for dealing with this very refractory ore on a large scale
isn’t settled, by any means.

Litigation over the acid process for making
zinc concentrates isn’t finished yet. So far B.H. Prop,
has got the better of the Potter Co. (latter claims right to
every acid process); but as the Potter people are pur-
suing the matter to Vic. Supreme Court, the B.H. Prop,
applied for a Commission to take evidence in England.
This Commission proved so costly a business that the
Potter Co. has had to go into liquidation as the easiest
way of raising money. Originally the Potter process was
in a 160-share syndicate, which developed into a 200,000
share co. ; £1 shares, fully paid. Forty thousand shares
were reserved. To keep things going 480 debentures, of
£5 each, were issued. New co. will be in 200,000 shares ;
old£l shares will be issued paid to 17s. 6d., and deben-
ture holders (who are also shareholders) will be offered 50
shares for each debenture. The Potter people had
Crookes arid Dewar, two British front-rank chemists, as
their chief witnesses before the Commission in England ;
and a cable to the co. says the evidence was satisfactory.
Meantime the B.H. Prop, goes on extending its acid plant
as though it had nothing whatever to fear from the rest
of the proceedings.

B.H. Block 14 hopes to get some of the way out
of its financial troubles by stripping out what is left of its
carbonates in the upper levels ; but the quantity and
quality are both uncertain. There is a good market for
this ore at present. In fact, if it could be conveniently
got at now, some of the old filling would fetch a rattling
price. With good management and ordinary luck in the
way of metal markets, this mine is going to do all right.

B.H. Junction has got down to working the mill
one shift a day. And a B.H. mine which can only run its
mill one shift shouldn’t run its mill at all till it has more
ore.

Hillgrove Prop. (N.S.W.) has let a contract to
sink 200 ft. with machine drills. Not likely any shaft-
sinking records will be broken ; for one thing, the rock is
too hard. Some Baker’s Creek ground was exceptionally
hard boring, and the Prop.’s shaft is only 90ft. from the
boundary. The mine is going the pace with development.
Eveu suggested that the Prop, adit should be extended to
prove the Eleanora deep levels ; but sinking and driving
would have to be done in any case to prove intermediate
ground below the present Eleanora workings.

East Greta (Stanford Merthyr, Newcastle) is
one of the few N.S.W. coal co.’s which continue to wear
a smile. Last half-year’* output was a record, and the
directors don’t make any gloomy remarks about the
future. Now proposed to raise the capital from £125,000
to £150,000, in order to better handle the larger output
(this co. is using coal-cutting machines); though, as the
co. has been paying 10 per cent., it looks as though it
ought to have been able to do a little thing like that in
some other way. Last half year’s profit was £8053, after pay-
ing £3792 royalty and writing off £1668 depreciation. Co.
still, however, owes £4300 on Stanford Merthyr property
account, besides £9OOO raised on mortgage ; so that it has
something to shift besides coal. Hence the proposal to
raise the money by going to shareholders, in the hope of
getting both the debt and the coal shifted promptly.

Mr. Hugh Reid, George’s fat brother, has been
displaying family characteristics. He is widow J. A. Wal-
lace’s father, and so is on the Chiltern Valley Mines
board. The show is the best alluvial dividend-payer in
Vic., and the Wallace-Reid combination is credited with
taking a fat slice of the profits earned each year. Yet
Hugh Reid must patter out at the half-yearly meeting a
lot of figures intended to show that gold mining
does not pay in Vic. For the matter of that, if
insolvencies are any criterion, the failures in any
business pursuit outnumber the successes. Why, then,
should a Flinders Lane softgoods merchant, who
knows as much about mining as he does about
manual work, sling mud at the industry that has done so
much for Australia ? The finest pioneering element in
the world was attracted to Australia by the gold dis-
covery, and it is the pioneering blood that moves the
best spirits of the Commonwealth to-day to make the
country a place fit for a man to live in, and not a Reid
community of fat-men importers. Queensland, Vic.,
Westralia have the miner everywhere, and their people
have too much solid sense not to know that the balance-
sheet must be on the right side or he would of necessity
soon disappear. Bendigo, body and soul, is a mining
town ; and there is more prosperity there than in any
other town in the State of Victoria. Where Mr.
Reid made his error was in linking up Stock Exchange
floats that never represent real mining with genuine shows.
Victoria has had plenty of the former; but the wild-
cat’s innings isn’t what it was there, because the public
is better looked after by the press, and skilled mining
talent soon detects a fraud. Reid’s taste in speaking in
this way of the industry from which he draws his divs.
is on a par with his attack on mine workers at the pre-
vious meeting of the co.

Managers and directors who are desirous of cutting down
working expenses, without sacrificing efficiency. Most
mines use a considerable quantity of rubber goods per
annum, which is imported in most cases, and in many
instances partly perished before put in use, the con-
sequence being frequent replacements. If manage! s
will use Dunlop rubber belting, packings, gaskets, suction,
air and steam hose, they can effect a considerable saving,
as these goods are freshly made of the best grade rubber,
and are free from perish. The Dunlop Tyre Co., who

The Wilfley Slime Table which has been in
operation on the Ivanhoe Gold Mines for some months
past has been giving extremely good results. Mr. H. T.
Brett, Metallurgist of the Ivanhoe Gold Corporation, in an
article contributed to the March number of the Chamber
of Mines Journal, W.A., gives particulars of the sayings
made, and states that the introduction of the Wilfley
Slime Table will be of great service in treating the low-
grade sulphide ores of the field. Since the future of
Kalgoorlie is so intimately bound up with the most
economical solution of this sulphide problem, this
assurance from Mr. Brett is a most important matter.

Oil Engines.—lnformation has just reached
us that the Government Award (Gold Medal) in this class,
at the present Capetown Exhibition, has been awarded to
the “ Hornsby ” Oil Engine. The success of this engine is
perhaps the most remarkable in engineering history.
There is no engineering speciality which can claim, as
the “ Hornsby ” oil engine does, to have obtained every
highest award in the world—viz., England, America,
Australian, France and Russia, &c.—and last year it
secured the British Government award of £lOOO. It is
made in various types of fixed, portable, traction and

The Babcock Boiler seems to be favored by
mining engineers, over 50 mines in Australia using these
boilers. Mount Morgan has 20, Waihi Gold Mining Co.
24, Mount Lyell 12, Tasmanian Gold Mining Company 7,
and at Broken Hill there are 30 distributed amongst the
mines, water works, and electric supply, while in
Western Australia they are looked upon as a necessity,
there being now 68 in the principal mines and Kalgoorlie
Water Supply. It will be noted that coal is expensive at
Broken Hill, and wood fuel is expensive at W.A. These
figures speak for themselves. Evidently the ease of
transportation, the economy in fuel and maintenance and
the adaptability to any class of fuel, that are such con-
spicuous points in the Babcock Boiler, are much
appreciated in Australian mines.*^

Associated Northern, Kalgoorlie, is admittedly
getting played out, its life being put at two years, or
thereabouts. Under circumstances, management is look-
ing for a new property, and has its eye on something in
the Southern Cross district. So far, Cross mining ha 3
been a failure. Still, people are tired of looking for shows
outback, where mines have a nasty habit of petering out
at shallow depths ; and as most Cross mining hitherto
has been hampered by want of cash, and as no work has
been done below 300 ft. or in sulphide zone, there may be
something there worth trying.

Smith’s Creek (N.Q.) report that a bulk sample
from lode (taken Bft. wide) at 200 ft. is worth 4 per cent,
tin oxide, does net mean 4 per cent, metallic tin by a
long chalk ; it probably means about 3 per cent, metal.
As some oxide is also lost in concentrating, the assays
stated in this manner give a very poor idea of ore values.
The smelter probably makes more out of tin ore than any
other ; that’s no doubt why most of it is snapped up by
foreign buyers. Tin was smelted years ago at Irvine-
bank (N.Q.) and packed over the ranges to the coast on
mules. Australia is still largely in the pack-mule stage,
exporting ore and importing tin plates.

Article on the chivalry of the Japanese in
Sydney D.T. (2!)/4/’05) assumes as facts a lot of
loose statements about the doings of Japs and
Russians on the battle-field, and from them makes
some curious deductions. One must hit the
evangelical supporters of the Telegraph hard:
But it may perhaps ba said that the Japanese moral
code of “ Bushido ” is at least more straightforward than
the contradictory obligations which beset the con-
scientious Christian.
Paganism is thus pronounced a more straight-
forward code of morals than the Christian religion.
CONVERSATION IN THE SMART SET.
MISS BINKLER : “And so you prefer motoring to riding?”

Dear Bulletin : I wish to call your atten-
tion to the danger to the purity of the home and
the sanctity of the marriage tie involved in the
existence of State Socialistic baths in Woolloo-
mooloo Bay, Sydney. The Government has set
up there a swimming area which is conspicuously
clean, well-kept, and neat. It is a constant
temptation to men to go and bathe. And I refer
you to the writings of some of the Early Christian
Fathers as to the moral dangers of bathing.—

Rev. J. J. Stead, at a recent Baptist con-

that is essential, but the godly snuffle of the elect
as they give it tongue. No Snuffle, no salvation.

“ Mulga Mat ”
“ Country Schoolmaster” surely exaggerates greatly(B.
20/4/’O5) in his remarks as to the increase of nervous weak-
ness among back-blocks school-children. I have visited
almost every out-back school west of the meridian, on
business bent. Having been a teacher once, in my salad
days, I still take a keen interest in school-children, apart
from their commercial value to myself. I certainly saw
but rare cases of loss of control of limbs. In Broken Hill
the pupils seem.to be smaller than the average in
other large towns; but there, as elsewhere, owing
to sensible sympathetic culture, the pupils are sturdy
and active. Recently I attended a school func-
tion west o’ Darling-. Chief item was a splendidly-
performed floral maypole dance by mere babies, who were
all fine physical specimens of Commonwealthers —sound
in mind and limb, especially in mind. The great physical
evil used to be sore eyes. This was particularly notice-
able during the drought. Many out-back teachers made
their sore-eyed pupils use castor oil externally with won-
derful results. Where constant involuntary twitchings of
the head, of the arms, or a swaying of the body is common,
the fault lies, not with the education system, but with the
abominable in-breeding, &c.—especially the infernal &c.
My experience West and West-o’-West is that the State
school is fast becoming the one bright spot in the lives of
the children of out back.

Theatrical managers in Sydney grumble at
the City Council’s action in abolishing the “queue”
system—the organisation of the waiting crowds
outside theatres into long lines—but carefully dodge
the real issue. It is not so much the queue as the
misuse of the queue that is undesirable. The
theatrical managers take ad vantage of the system
to frame early door rules which are seemingly
designed to make people pay something more than
the advertised price of admission in order to get
good seats. That is bad policy, and since it
creates a street nuisance, blocking the thorough-
fare, the City Council has a right to interfere. If
it goes further, and insists that theatres open all
their doors at least an hour before the beginning
of the performance. Or makes it a condition of
license that seats to all parts of the house can bq
reserved on payment of a small booking fee, there
would be no more trouble. Then, should the
theatrical managers conclude that their present
prices are not remunerative without an early door
extortion added, let them be raised.

“ S.S.” : Other experts have aired their
views about the splendid gun practice and fine
efficiency of ‘ ‘ our boys ” at the Easter Encamp-
ment (Vic.), but the only thing that impressed me
was the quality and quantity of the big beer practice
maintained throughout the several days of the
encampment. Immediately the swaddy could
break away from any other form of military
manoeuvre, he descended heavily upon the adja-
cent beer, and the enemy of his country got a
terribly severe handling. It is a melancholy fact
that many of our young heroes regard the en-
campment as a liquid picnic. This year it was
dry externally, but the application of beer to the
affected parts was more strenuous and sustained
than usual. Which recalls a Colonel Price shivoo
after the Boer war. “Our lads would go through
fire and water for the mother country ! ” cried the
colonel. “Make it beer, Tom!” interjected an
anxious voice.

N.S.W. Chief Secretary Hogue on Social-
ism “as a dream of madmen” : “All men are
not alike; some are abler and in every way better
than others, and no amount of artificial restriction
can keep these from succeeding beyond their
fellows.” Note the shallow mind’s ready accept-
ance of the conventional absurdity that success is
the reward of the good and the gifted. Had Mr.
Hogue said, “ Some men are less scrupulous and in
every way worse than others, and no amount of arti-
ficial restriction can keep these from succeeding
beyond their fellows,” he would have been uttering a
much more convincing reflection upon the times.
The idea that in present circumstances the good
man and the able one always get their reward is
quite a telling argument with tne stupid, who do
not pause to investigate with a view to discover-
ing in what way the class now enjoying the
“rewards” are more gifted, or more virtuous,
than their fellows. In the mind of Mr. Hogue,
“haying” and “deserving” are synonymous,
despite the fact that many men are in gaol, and
many more ought to be, for merely “having.”

Everything comes to him who hates. To

That benevolent-looking old

Australia as variegated as the sign
over his book-arcades, has published
a new pamphlet in the interests of
his pet gospel. He prints five dia-
grams to show “ the nearness of vast
colored populations to us.” To the
ordinary man that would suggest the
necessity of hurrying up with a white
population to keep the others out; but
to Mr. Cole it merely suggests open-
ing the door, and pasting up a
notice that it is open. There are
crowds of people who would like to
rifle Mr. Cole’s book-shelves ; yet,
strange to say, the impossibility of
keeping them out doesn’t occur to
him, and every night he puts up the
shutters as usual. And the chances
are that if one lot of shutters didn’t
keep them out he would put up two.

“ Melb.” : What are the Syd-
ney police paid for? During a visit
to Sydney, a week or two ago; I
was watching a wedding from my Phillip-
street boarding-house verandah, and was
surprised to see no less than four police-
men in attendance to see, as I thought,
that the society crowd didn’t play up
and break the stlbet lamps. Then out of
the church popped a stout sergeant,
yelling, “Lady H ’s carriage !” as if
his billet depended upon Lady H ’s
carriage being on the spot in five seconds.
The four other policemen took up the cry,
and for a few moments it was like the
tail end of a part song. It may sound a
bit superior to say so, but over here in
Melbourne we put our cops to better use
than to act as call-boys at society functions.
AS TO THE CRITICS.
“ The hero was true till death, anyway!”
“Well , he certainly wasn't true to life!”
There’s room in the Yic. Assembly for a
member who will keep aii eye on the parks and
garden reserves, and raise a question every time
a piece of public property is fenced off and built
upon. The South Yarra Domain skirting the
Botanical Gardens, Melbourne, seems to be
gradually being converted into a private township,
with a thoroughfare running through it. During
the past few years many trees have been cut down
and sundry buildings have cropped up. The
Domain is not the “spooning” ground it was in
the days when the modern Angelina’s mother was
luring Edwin’s father to his doom. It must have
been a public reserve before the encroachments
began. An inquiry into the wherefore of these
inner reserves might lead to a useful exposure of
petty land-grabbing in other directions. A good
many well-to-do Melbourne citizens are said to
have built their villas upon land which was
originally reserved by the Government for ceme-
tery purposes, and was never sold to the people
who squatted on it. It was granted to them in a
mysterious manner.
THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL.
[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
A holy man was travailing along the steep, strait road,
A slim and sinewy sinner apast him gaily strode.
No burden bore that sinner, without nor yet within,
Naught but hard bone and muscle beneath a shining skin.
“ O, tarry,” cried the pilgrim, “ but tarry for a while,
That innocence may gather some wisdom from thy guile ;
How comes it that thou climbest up this steep hill so
fresh ?
Where hast thou left thy burden—the burden of the
flesh ? ”
Then spoke that sinewy sinner, “If thou wouldst enter in
The narrow gate of Heaven thou must be trained by Sin ;
The load which chafes and galls thee was given thee to
spend,
But thou, 0 foolish pilgrim, would bear it to the end."

THE PATH OF LOVE.
[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
A whisper like the breath o i summer airs
Trembles to me;
A rose-flush such as sea-sprung morning bears,
I see, I see ;
A quickening as of new life in the heart
Of trees and flowers, I feel within me start;
Faint pulsings seem to be
Young laughing Love re-born, and singing unawares.
A pathway to my heart, my love, there is,
And thy dear eyes
Have found it out: my happiness were this,

Queensland hasn’t yet been educated out
of treating its leper casually. A white, who
had contracted the disease, was reported Ironi
Townsville at the end of November. Something
was officially said about the matter in December ;
but “before anything could be done, he had
moved on to Cairns—where they take off their
hats to the man who brings the leprosy. Ap-
parently, as he had moved to Cairns, it wasn t
thought necessary to pursue the subject any
further, until another complaint was made.
At the end of December the man was
found living at the back of his sister s
house, was examined on the 30th by a
doctor, and pronounced a leper. He seems to have
waited over a month for something to happen ;
but, as nothing did happen, he moved on with his
spots. Naturally, therefore, when, in February
the Board of Health “officially declared” him a
leper, he wasn’t to be found ; but at latest the
authorities had an idea that he was somewhere up
north, living on a station ; and there they proposed
to leave him. In another case the leper actually
died between the time he was “ reported ” and the
date on which the Board issued its “ official recog-
nition,” though there wasn’t much delay in this
instance. And all the satisfaction that the Cairns
municipal council got, when it said that its leper
was becoming rather more than even it could
stand, was a cheerful note remarking that there
were several worse diseases than leprosy.

The young bankrupt from Singleton
(N.S.W.) still languishes in prison for declining
to answer a question put by the Bankruptcy
Registrar. Unless he breaks the seal he has put
on his lips as a matter of honor, he may become a
unique replica of the Fleet-street debtor of old.
According to the N.S. Wales Insolvency law, he
is committed to prison “there to remain until he
shall have done the thing required of him or shall
be discharged by the Court.” An appeal for his
release can only be made to a Judge when he has
“fully answered all lawful questions put to him.”

An English woman visitor to Maoriland,
who professed to be an Alpine climber, has been
complaining in the local papers that she was
debarred from ascending Mount Cook by the im-
possibility of getting guides and by the enormity
of their charges. M.L. Tourist Department points
out that guides were offered to ner, and that a
lady who had avowedly come all the way from
England in order to climb Mount Cook should
scarcely think £l2 too much for a four or five days’
climb with two guides—about the same sum as is
charged for an ascent of Mont Blanc in two days.
Chief guide Clark further asserts that the lady’s
chief trouble was that she couldn’t climb up to
the level of even the ordinary amateur. M.L. is
beginning to find that a Tourist Department is
not all roses. Lately there was a noble deer-
stalking visitor from England, who went away
seething with indignation because the M.L. hills
were rough, and a “ noble ” sport was expected to
sleep in the same hut with his guide when out on
the trail.

Federal Customs authorities have stopped
the entry of a publication entitled “The Illus-
trated Artistio Encyclopaedia”—a collection of
photographs from the nude designed for artists’
use. The action is an ill-advised bit of prudery.
Artists must study the nude, in real life or in
photographs. To shut them off from the use of
photographs is only to make more study from life
necessary, and probably the Customs official whose
sensitive mind is shocked by the idea of artists
seeing photographs of nude women would be
even more shocked at the idea of them seeing the
nude in the warm flesh, instead of the cold print of
the camera. Of course the objection is, to an
extent, valid that pictures such as those stopped
(which, by the way, judging from specimens
that got through, are not coarse) are bought
by some folk from prurient and not artistic
motives, just as some soft-brained voluptuaries are
wont to pretend to be artists in order to have nude
subjects posed before them. But the law can’t
afford to deprive some people of what is practically
a necessity, because some other people may also
acquire it and use it ill. The logical outcome of
that idea would be the legal abolition of one or
other of the sexes.
Yic. Govt, offers incurable consumptives,
in the place of the finely appointed and splendidly
equipped Kronheimer wing of the Austin hospital,
an abiding place in a few tents on a bleak clearing
at Broadmeadows, a spot almost inaccessible to
the relatives of the afflicted, and with no water
supply. The tents are not even properly rain-
proof, and there are no fireplaces. “In winter
the patients would starve with cold,” says Dr.
Duncan Turner, who has been investigating as an
expert. It would be business-like of the Govt, to
locate this “ sanatorium ” at the new cemetery. It
would save a second handling of patients.
The reported boo-hooing (denied by some)
of Governor Rawson by a small section in
a Broken Hill theatre, the other night, was
falsely and maliciously set down by the
D.T. to the influence of the Labor Party’s
manifesto, and particularly to that phrase
which advised “the cultivation of an Aus-
tralian sentiment, based upon the maintenance
of racial purity, and the development in Australia
of an enlightened and self-reliant community.”
What is there in that to suggest that the
presence of Governor Rawson at Broken
Hill, should be accounted a menace to
“racial purity” or calculated to prevent the
development of “self-reliance” among Austra-'
lians ? The very trifling demonstration arose
from the fact that on the Barrier there are num-
bers of Russians, Poles, Austrians, Italians, Ger-
mans and others, all sufferers from the tyranny of
monarchy, and many of them exiled because of
their refusal to submit to oppression. To such
men any representative of royalty is odious, and
Governor Rawson’s presence seems to have evoked
a slight demonstration of feeling.

ers ! ” Give the Tory
press a fair run, and
how much longer
before it is quoting
with approval the
statement of Mr. Job
Jobwock, now in
London on a tour,
that in Australia the
labor unions, aided
by a Socialistic Go-
vernment, are in the
habit of kidnapping employers
and dragging them to the Arbitration
Court, where, on the rack, with hot irons to their
feet, they are examined as to what increases of
wages they will give ?

The Melbourne police have just unearthed
what looks like a well-developed case of klepto-
mania, though, the interested party not being a
“representative citizen,” that plea has not been
raised so far. Till the police traced to his house
certain timber stolen from a partly-built house, he
had been accepted as the embodiment of all the
virtues. Employed for nine years steadily at one
factory, a husband and a father, sober and a
church-goer, buying his house on time-payment,
and spending every spare moment in improving
his property —no man’s life could have been
steadier. But when the police had finished over-
hauling his things, they carried away enough
stolen property to fill three cells and the watch-
house yard twice over. The man must have
spent every spare hour in irregular acquisition.
Calico, sheeting, flannelette, underclothing, boots,
bikes, harness, carpenter’s tools, window-frames,
doors, flooring-boards, galvanised-iron, piping, a
hand-truck, a phaeton, a jinker, a kitchen-range,
gas-fittings, a rocking-horse, Indian shawls, vases,
tables, chairs, china tea-sets, scores of choice pot-
plants, garden-hose, clocks, a motor-bike —all was
fish to his net. Building allotments, cathedrals, and
tram-cars were about the only things he had not
lifted. And. in the midst of all this rush and toil,
he had found time to build three kiosks in
Japanese style to accommodate pot-plants, and a
house for the phaeton. Also, he kept in order a
choice little garden, and always found time to
hoist a Royal Standard or a Union Jack on his
perhaps stolen flag-pole on fitting “loyal” occa-
sions.

Whafc is happening to the “boys of the
Bull-dog breed” ? According to the official figures
of last year, notwithstanding the pitifully low
physical standards now required, “of 92,000 men
who offered themselves to the recruiting sergeants,
45,000 were rejected as physically unfit ! ” A Bull-
dog is not expected to be an animal distinguished
for an excess of brain-power, but he should have
at least weight and muscle. Now a century of
Freetrade and Capitalism has reduced him to
the proportions of an ill-fed poodle.

Alleged by men who know much of
the working of Australian asylums for the
insane that quite a “trade” is carried on
in the shipment of “dotty” persons .from
the continent of Europe. Certainly the
law blocks persons with general paralysis
or advanced or acute mania; but there
are plenty of other brands of mental
lesion. It is a significant fact, anyway,
that, while the German-born population
of N.S.W. represents only 0'67 per cent,
of the whole, the German patients in
the asylums number 2 per cent, of the
whole ; and some other foreign countries
show up in much the same way.

“Itan”: Be the practice in some
States of making witnesses stand in the
law courts (B. 13/4/’O5), seats are pro-
vided in Queensland in all but the police
courts. Even in the latter, when the
evidence of the witness is lengthy, a
chair is brought forward, especially for
female witnesses. The result is that
there is less hysteria exhibited amongst
that class of witnesses, while the males
give their testimony apparently in a
more comfortable way.

Apparently those “authorities”
who gave Melbourne’s various park trusts
their powers had but a poor conception
of the meaning of the word “trustee.”
A while back the Albert Park trustees
obligingly gave the Middle Park Bowl-

land ; now they have presented a choice
block next to the S. Melb. Cricket
Ground to another bowling club. Also a
trotting track has been handed over to the
Speedway Club. And the rich men so favored
are very well able to buy their own play-grounds.

“ H.G.” : Was yarning, the other,
day, with a Norwegian sailor, and had my
eyes opened to a few facts of the sea-
man’s life. Had hitherto believed
that, as a set-off to low wages, long
hours, bad food and constant
danger, the sailor was able to seo
the world without difficulty, but
found that in a very large number
of ports tlie men never leave
their ships. This man, who had
been to sea since childhood, told
me that, although he had eight
times visited Rio, he had never
once landed at that port, the captain
stating that the prevalence of fever
ashore necessitated the crew stay-
ing on board the ship, anchored in
the harbor. Four trips to Argen-
tina gave him only one oppor-
tunity to land on a half-hour’s
errand to a ship-chandler. New
York he knew fairly well,
mainly owing to his having
deserted there; but, out of
dozens of calls to London,
he had never really been
inside the big city, all the
vessels having berthed at
Tilbury Docks, 20 miles
down the Thames.

of Australasia, doesn’t appear to have a single
whole-life policy-holder who has passed 94. But
it has at least one annuitant of 100. Certainly a
man who is now 100 would have been a bit past
the average insurance age when the society was
formed, 56 years ago.

She may imagine that she does, but the old Eve is

You sang of love which never fails,

How foolish it all seems ;

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Mat 2, 1905.
My Dear Arini.—
For fresh impressions of a Governor-General’s
ball—ask a debutante. There were several at the
Northcotes’ party on Thursday night, carrying
their virginal posies, as the wise ones carried their
lamps to that Scriptural wedding. There was
little or no dancing for the fluffy ones. Space
admits only of the vice-regal tangle, or lancers,
with which the ball is started—and stopped.
Lady Northcote is faithful to mauve, either
because it suits her or, perhaps, it is her mascotte
shade. I see that the papers are now calling it
amethyst, which sounds more peeressy than simple
mauve. The Wards of M.L. were the only
strangers to the Commonwealth in the vice-regal
set—the lady trailing a lovely gown of white with
big heliotrope flowers.
Most of the really useful society women—those
who are prominent in good works—were there.
Mrs. Barton, Mrs. M‘Millan, the Admiraless,
Mrs. R. E. O’Connor. Excitement of the evening
was the presence of pretty widow Burdekin, who,
with her bride-elect daughter, had returned to
Sydney that morning. She is a little younger
and plumper, and wore white satin with the
latest thing in white silver sequined adornment.
A number of shaded dresses took the eye. Mrs.
Ewan Frazer’s green chiffon was shaded, from the
darkest green at the hem up to Brussels sprouts
tint, and from that to the livid hue that plays on
the Face at the Window, or the figure of the ghost
in “Hamlet.” Mrs. Walter Hall, as a precious-
stone exposition, ran Lady Northcote close. But
how odd a heavily-jewelled woman looks wearing
s pecs and carelessly screwed-up hair !
Last two days of the Autumn race meeting
were made merry by the number of freak dresses,
and the outburst of Joseph’s-coat feathers. Mrs.
E. Frazer, who is supposed to be one of the dressers
of this continent, caused an obstruction of lawn-
J lacing by wearing a flaring-red kimono. A long,
ace theatre coat with jewelled crabs at the neck,
waist, and wide sieves was also there, and all the
crabs had on all their numerous limbs. Mrs.
Alec Hay needed only to lower the neck
of a blue chiffon velvet dress to make it
a _ first-rate ball gown. It had an eel
skirt that prevented her taking steps longer
than those of a high-born Chinese maiden. All
the Burdekin clan wore shaded feathers, and Miss
Eadith Walker had an extra long one shaded green
to white. Shot glace silks are “in,” so evidently
is blotting-paper pink as a hue. Mrs. Jack Toohey
exhibited it in cloth, and Miss Nora Dangar in
hop-sack. It is soothing to one’s patriotism to
learn that the b.p.p. cloth is manufactured here.
Mrs. Blanche - Wallace - Potts was a quietly-
dressed figure at the races. And Miss Maud
Amber, the noted American Travesty star, was
around after a long, long attack of gastritis. The
sleek Mr. Hugh Pollock, back from the Cold
Land, was there, and also the Woodfords, who
have been with the Northcotes on very chummy
terms. Mr. W. is High Commissioner of some or
other islands that are set in dark-purple spheres
of sea.
A visitor from Melbourne quite kept up
the reputation she acquired in Hobart (as one of
the givers of the Garter-and-Stocking dinner).
She had an escort of some of the sheepish naval
youths, and probably a discussion on feet or
hosiery was in progress, for the group paused near
the tea-house and the lady, drawing up her skirts,
extended a shapely limb with a “ Now, isn’t that
a three ?’’ air. Another caper of this Dodo-ish
lady is get ‘ 1 smart men ” to write their autographs
on one of the flounces of her underskirt. She
boasts twelve autos, in blue pencil.
Two personages who seem to enjoy themselves
greatly these race and garden-party days among a
crowd of sentimental young things are Mr.
Francis Suttor and Commandant Gordon. Mrs.
Suttor is in England, Mrs. Gordon arrives to-day
from Melbourne and will be quartered at the
Barracks.
The best-looking girl of some importance we
have had with us for some time is Miss Fanshawe,
daughter of the Admiral. I hear that the Fan-
shawes give a dance this week. An Admiralty
House ball is a very solemn affair. There’s the
same “atmosphere ” whether at a dance, a garden
party, a rag-mat-for-the-heathen bee, or a bazaar
m aid of Destitute Dolphins.
Victorian State-Governor Talbots are over here,
but not for any of our frisks. They go to Medlow
and Katoomba and the Caves. Talking of Med-
low : Mr. Mark Foy has been seriously ill at his
house at Bellevue Hill.
One of the finest set of exhibits at the Agri-
cultural Show was of canned fruit and vegetables
sent from the West. Awhile ago the dwellers
there couldn’t grow a green cabbage or fresh
fruit. Artesian bores have changed the face of
the land. Now two of its (preserved) peaches fill
a biff glass jar. Another good item was the
exhibit of Australian-made pure wool tweeds and
cloth. Perhaps the local pure-merino ladies will
be encouraged to oftener wear what has been
shorn from their own flocks and manufactured
here by , the bold advertisement of Lady
Northcote’s good example. As good tweeds are
made in this new country as ever were made in the
old, but, alas, much of our patriotism is of the
bunting order of the Empire League women.
At the Northcotes’ ball, the band played “ Roast
Beef of Old England ” when the guests went in to
supper. How unoriginal! Couldn’t Australians
rush the supper-table to a two-step called “Rabbit
Ragout” or a grand march, “The Boiled Emu of
Brewarrina.”
Three fashionable weddings filled last week
with chimes and the scent of orange blossoms.
Mr. T. Leslie Willsallen, a son of squatter people
in Gunnedah, married Miss Pearl King, third
daughter of other squatter people —the Gidley
Kings—and a descendant of the third Governor
of this State. The Gidley Kings have been
squatting here and in Norfolk Island for
close on 120 years. Mr. Gerald Campbell,
a popular young widower, was married to
Miss Marion Mein, a niece of late Charles
Stuart Mein, who was someone in Brisbane.
Bride is one of two nice girls who have lived very
quietly here with their grandmother. Third
wedding was that of a Darling Point man
named Mansfield to Miss Lucy Huthwaite, one of
the Stephen family.
An English paper:—“A welcome and distin-
fuished figure in the play is that of Mr. Maurice
'arkoa, whose dainty humor and splendid voice
are too well-known to need any,” etc., etc. No
wonder Wybert Reeve writes in local S.M.H.
that the English are an unmusical nation !
Awhile ago a handsome Maorilander, married
to a member of one of our biggest families, started
dressmaking. She is doing a huge trade. An
order from Lady Nortlicote for six gowns gave her
a great and swift vogue.
Latest recruit to the “society” milliners and
dressmakers is Mrs. Macnamara, widow of the
late well-known and much-esteemed solicitor. She
was a Miss Hill, sister of a former belle of Sydney
—Miss Nelly Hill. For partner, Mrs. Macna-
mara has Mrs. Turner, who I think is best known
as the mother of a beautiful daughter—Miss
Birdie Turner, now squatteress Maddrell.
The Victorian bowlers in Sydney for the inter-
state contest were entertained at the close of
the contest by Mr. John Young, of Annandale, at
an all-day party. None but bowlers (who have
notoriously teak and steel constitutions) could go
through an all-day programme of sports, dancing,
speeching, singing, biograph views (with numerous
interludes for refreshments), and come out still at
the top of their condition. Mr. Young, who,
among other righteous and unrighteous works,
has been Mayor of Sydney, a collector of Neapoli-
tan marbles, and builder of old St. Mary’s Cathe-
dral, lives in one of the quaintest of old houses.
On his 25 year-old green were played the first
inter-State bowling matches.
Mr. Charles Moore, who was director of Sydney
Botanic Gardens for over 48 years—from ’4B to ’96
—died on Sunday night, aged 86. He was a dis-
tinguished botanist and zoologist and was a mem-
ber of pretty well every scientific association. Mr.
Moore’s wife died some years ago. He was child-
less, but a young niece was a devoted nurse and
housekeeper. Mr. Moore leaves considerable
money which, report says, goes mainly to Scotch
relatives.
Marriage of Miss Noni Rickards was a sump-
tuous function, lavish as you read of in fashion-
able novels.. Bride got, as presents from her
father, an income and a grand piano. Among
her jewels worn at the ceremony were valuable
amethysts and turquoises, the gift of Mr. G.
Rignold (worn by his late wife on her wedding
day). As for rare chinas, silver-ware, and the
like, Mrs. Maas will have to get a good space of
the Safe Deposit. Bridegroom Maas is a tall,
pale, Lord Beauchamp-ish cast of young man.
They will occupy “Canonbury,” the Rickards
mansion at Darling Point, during the absence of
Papa and Mama Rickards in England.
Miss Jessie Maclachlan, the Scottish singer,
is the most Spanish-looking Jessie I have ever
seen. Ha,ir so black that, if an artist were
painting it, he’d use green in the shadows.
Complexion of perfect, unbroken whiteness—the
“radiant pallor,” if ever there was such; eyes
black but soft. (Black eyes mostly snap.) A
rather small, short face with regular features;
a fine, full figure (dressed in unrelieved black
velvet), and a speaking voice of such charm that no
wonder the middle-aged Scotch gentlemen who
formed her escort at the Highland Soc.’s re-
reption last night gambolled and fawned
around her, and all but told the audience
that they never loved till now. In private
life, the singer is Mrs. Buchanan. Her husband
is the accompanist. After Mr. James Inglis had
introduced her to the packed gathering of the
clans, Miss Maclachlan made a speech in unac-
cented English, and later —the clans nearly
jumped out of their kilts with joy—spoke in
Gaelic. Irish ballads as well as Scotch master-
pieces are to be on her programme.
Mrs. Pilcher, who was Miss Alice Mack, sister
of Louise, leaves for London presently. Her
husband, who “follows the sea,” has been trans-
ferred to a liner that swims between old-world
parts.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“ How our sex dissimulates even to its very self
in a dark, empty room ! An artiste, on tour, tells
how she has been followed on land and sea all
the way from the Cold Country by an infatuated
youth. ‘ Isn’t it dreadful! ’ she exclaims, with
sadly puckered brows. Of course, she has never
given him the slightest encouragement. She
won’t even let on in the still, dark room that she
has. And I’ve actually heard some sympathisers
turn to each other and express indignation at
the forward young man. They pretend to show
sympathy, but it’s only a sense of esprit de corps
leading them to join in the humbug. ‘ Isn’t he a
nuisance?’ the engaged girl says on the approach
of the man whom she has wired (reply-paid) to
come.
“The abrupt announcement in the Easter
Saturday papers setting out that Miss Dora
Vaughan Kent had been married to Mr. David
Louis Howard, at Christ Church, South Yarra,
two days previously, was astonishing. There
hadn’t been a single bugle blast—not even the
blow of a penny whistle—to herald the event. It
was obviously a romantic mating. Gossips started
ringing each other up on the ’phone early on
Monday morning. By the evening, it was known
that the ’groom was the visiting son of a Liver-
pool medico—a youth with money.
“The assorted medical students in the public
hospitals are a source of much pain and tribulation
to the shy patients. I know a gentle young per-
son, greatly reduced in circumstances, having to
enter a public hospital recently for a most delicate
but highly respectable operation. In a private
institution it would have cost well over £lOO ; so
there was no choice. With tears, she told me she
felt like a disorderly person had up for some
horrible offence before a female magistrate. The
woman-official in the high dock (inquiry desk)
asked her the usual questions of domestic circum-
stances, marriage, residence with husband, means
of livelihood, etc., etc., with a sharp, inquisitorial
air, and the seedy and evil onlookers (other wait-
ing sufferers) looked on with a grim, gutter-wise,
cynical air of knowingness. Later came the
doctor’s cross-examination of physical conditions
before assorted students, all cheerful and brightly
curious. At about the tenth awful inquiry as to
her state (she is married) the patient broke down.
The medico thereon hinted that the students
might go to the casualty-ward. The men went —
every one of them. The women stopped. After
some more blushful inquiries the squirming patient
looked with a dog-like appeal to the doctor, and he
found some reason for the earnest young shemales
to go to an adjoining ward. And then the patient
spoke up her answers bravely. It was the assorted
audience she found so terrible.
“ While on the Hospital subject: A clever
medico declares that, neither in the practitioner
nor in the students in advanced study, are any
‘ feelings ’ whatever aroused. The mind of science
is alone active and exercised. The patient (male
or female) is merely an object of surgical or
medical inquiry. Sex, color or types scarcely
count at all. ‘ I have had as many as a thousand
women surgical cases a year in the various hos-
pitals—and of that thousand not one face do I
remember, but I have a vivid picture of many
figures.’ He said it out bluntly, with enthusiasm.
I suppose, on the operating table, when one of the
numbfer returns a second or a third time for a
misplaced liver, the sawbones enthusiastically
greets the figure as an old friend, with a sort of
here-you-are-again wave of the saw in his surgical
right hand.
“A school committee requisitioned Miss Ruby
Madden to open a bun fete and cruet raffle, the
other day, which is Melbourne’s way of drawing a
crowd and having an interesting young person on
show. The i.y.p. generally doesn’t mind the
ordeal of stare. She likes being displayed in her
best clothes and brief authority before the multi-
tude. It’s different with some of the elders. The
Countess of Hopetoun always wore a look of
sufferance—sometimes of forbidding freeze. Lady
Brassey smiled through it painfully. Lady Clarke
made supreme efforts to convince the crowd how
much irksome duty became her pleasure. The
present Lady of Stonington gets through the
operation sotto voce, and; with a sudden look to
her Aides to come forth as a relief corps. But
give the brick-blessing ceremony to a sprightly
widow of importance, or to a Madden gem, and
there’s a tranquil sense of joy in the performance.
■ “In a southern suburb a young couple in their
teens—the girl nearer the twenties than the chappie
—marched home from a holiday outing last week
to her ma with the announcement that they had
been lawfully wedded that day. As soon as the
ma had recovered her senses siie asked, woman-
like, hadn’t they been to the picnic ? They
said simultaneously a nay. ‘But didn’t you
set out with your basket—the basket I packed—to
go to the picnic ? ’ ‘We got married instead,’ said
the girl in an excited giggle. Bure enough they
had. The basket of picnic provisions subsequently
served a honeymoon snack on the St. Hilda beach.
At present two lots of parents are seeing what can
be done about it.
“A globe-trotter writes out that she has met
quite a dozen of Melbourne’s established spinsters
in the Big Smoke. She gives accounts of their
doings in Anglo-Australian circles. Three or four
years ago when I was last there, all Australiennes
were rushed like Yank heiresses. * Wool-money ’
went round with a wink ! But since then—such
a change ! ‘Not a bean’ is the word given out
now and our girls are no longer suspected of
wealth.
“An elderly Dives, close up to the eighties, re-
ceives congratulations on the arrival of a son and
heir (a result of a second marriage) without any
excessive enthusiasm. To him it seems an ordi-
nary affair. He thinks people ought to fully expect
that sort of thing to happen in wedlock.
“London femininity are wearing hats with ap-
proachable brims. The prohibitive wide leaf that
formerly balconied the brow has gone right out,
and a snug little t6te-h-t6te toque is the thing. I
saw two smart matrons yarning at a creamy At-
home last week, when their wide-leafed millinery
scraped and sawed edges each time they faced
about for a spicy bit. It must have been annoy-
ing. The tete-h-tete toque should cotton on.
“Miss Doris Madden, a proficient young
pianiste, and Miss Ruby Grey, singing-bird, are
conjointly giving a concert this week at Glen’s
Hall. Miss Annie Davidson, on the strength of
Conservatorium starring, is marked down for a
special sing-song of her own at the Masonic Hall
before the May is far advanced.
“The smart girl no longer sings nigger plantation
refrains or goo-goo lullabies at breezy At Homes.
She whistles them. The Easter carnival brought
one musical respirator to fame. This was Miss
Clarice Robertson. The tone she produces by the
adroit management of her steam is quite sweet,
clear and flexible —so they say. But what will
she look like ? A whistling woman and a crowing
hen, etc.
“ Treasurer E. J. Tait, of Her Majesty’s, and
Miss Nita Coutie were married on Easter Wednes-
day. The pair took Polar furs and welted boots
for Mountain viewing up Katoomba’s chilly April
track.
“ Even Geelong wakes up for its yearly tennis
tournament, which, this Easter, included croquet
as well. At the nets, dainty, dark-eyed Miss
Raleigh, who has already won golf and tennis
trophies to the value of £7O, was beaten, when
partnered by her big, blonde brother, and again
in the ‘ladies double,’ when she and Judge
Molesworth’s daughter surrendered to tne
acrobatic energy of Miss Le Neveu and
Miss M. Simpson. On the croquet lawn, Mrs.
Monty Douglas, in the short, smart skirt and
business-like etceteras of the seasoned she-athlete,
came to the top with coadjutor Mackinnon. In
the single championship, W. R. Butler, a Mel-
bourne architect, beat W. G. A’Beckett.
“Mrs. Tom Fitzgerald had a rally of curious
and interested friends round her, at the Grand,
last week, to inspect the hundred and one quaint
novelties she had brought back from jungle and
prairie. While her hubbie snared the jaguar and
other wild beasties, Mrs. Fitzgerald visited fairs
and Indian bazaars, adding to her private museum
of curios.
“An ex-chorus chick, who once figured in a
case that might have been called ‘ The Romance
of a Typewriter,’ has fallen on her neat feet in the
Big Smoke. She is married to a man of money,
ana runs her high-rate motor, her private hansom
and sets of luxurious Polar furs on her fat income.
Another interesting fact is the likely marriage of
a wealthy widower (a big gun in mining circles)
with a recently returned footlighter of comely
attractiveness.
“ The interesting honeymooners, Mr. and Mrs.
D. L. Howard (who was Dora Kent), are sailing by
the Sonoma for an American jaunt. After that—
dalliance about the Mediterranean coast for any
jolly length of time.
“ The Yarra sculptors open a show on Friday
(sth inst.). Formerly, Margaret Baskerville—
whose deftness with chisel and brush is at present
being attested in the Big Smoke—ran this annual
display. Now a brother is to take her place in
charge.
“ Two dances made night merry in Geelong
during Tournament time. Mrs. Austin, whose
hospitable energy enlivened the week’s fixtures,
announced the engagement of her elder daughter
to Mr. Gatehouse, a young architect, physically
thin but financially fat.
“ Beauty sheds a tear over the solid square-toed
shoe that is prescribed for the damp season. It’s
a Yank fashion. Without examining the label I
know that. Wanting to be shod anew myself, I
found in a Collins-street store a dazzler in heavy
frown, and her stockinged foot atilt above a pile of
the new-toed gear. ‘Of course,’ said the boot-
man, ‘I can give you the tooth-pick shape,
madam, but, if I may venture to say so, you’ll
not be pleased when you see the new sensible
square-toe in general use.’ ‘Let me see them
again ! ’ moaned the dazzler. Thereat the shoer
went down on his marrow-bones and shoe-horned
the pretty foot into fifteen shapes one after
another. As she couldn’t reconcile her feelings to
the horrid sight of square-toes, she had her old
shoe laced on, and passed out with the petulant
remark that she ‘ would see.’
“The absentee blinds are hanging slack at the
two Vice-Regal mansions. As a consequence,
Toorak gives time to a hair-dip and a general
autumn renovation of its charms. Whenever
nothing is happening Society gets dyeing its wool
afresh and sugaring its smile for a future cam-
paign.
An Adelaide correspondent writes : —.
This year’s Onkaparinga race meeting, which S. Aus.
looks forward to as its biggest picnic party, was pictur-
esque. We wandered round in slush, wet through from
north to south. Coming back to town we bad a happy
time crossing Onkaparinga Creek. Womenfolk wandered
round with skirts gathered up to their knees, awaiting
their opportunity to get across by way of stepping-stones.
The water was almost waist-deep, and many of us
tumbled in. Half the men waded in; some of the
other half, who had won something, mistook the
depth and tried to swim the stream. A commercial
traveller, in high spirits, was wading through when a cab
wheel touched him. Very playfully he dipped his hands
into the muddy stream and, like a youngster sea-bathing,
splashed the people inside. A stout lady of quality
attempted to pass the flood waters by riding on the back
step of a waggonette cab, but became excited, and was
washed away, but was heroically rescued amidst
tremendous excitement.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
Twenty or 30 years ago, following on the
advances in surgery consequent on the discovery
of anaesthetics by dames Y. Simpson, of Edin-
burgh, in the 40’s, and of antiseptics by Lister, in
the 70’s, the knife in surgical cases came into such
wild use that the surgeon who was permitted to
make an abdominal section was frequently guilty
of “ highway robbery in the abdomen”— he was
prone to search for organs whose condition fur-
nished him with an excuse for removing them.
To-day, however, writes Samuel Hopkins A dams,
in McClure’s, “ the operator does not carry away
a diseased organ, or as much of it as he can get;
he rather excises the disease, performing not as
much as he may, but as little as he can.” This
reform has also spread to Australia.


MAD WITH PAIN.
CURED OF NEURALGIA BY DR. WILLIAMS’ PINK PILLS.
“"I jIOR MONTHS Neuralgia nagged at my
nerves night and day,” said Miss E.
JL Lucas, Kensington Street, Summer Hill,
Sydney. “I was simply driven mad
with pain. I tried all sorts of liniments, but they
did me not the least good. When they failed, I
made up my mind to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
as a last hope. They cured me like magic—and
they cured me for good.”
It is terrible to think of Miss Lucas suffering
such torture and trying to cure her Neuralgia with
worthless liniments. Neuralgia comes from bad
blood, and the best liniments and lotions in the
world are utterly useless to cure it. Neuralgia is
an acute irritation of the nerves caused by bad
blood—and good blood is the only possible cure
for it. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills actually moke
new blood—and that is the simple reason why
they cured Miss Lucas’ Neuralgia so easily after
everything else failed.
“No one ever had neuralgia worse than me,”
Miss Lucas went on. “It began suddenly with
sharp pains through my head. I could get no
sleep, for the pain was always worse at night. It
used to shoot through my head and up both sides
of my face. Every nerve in my body seemed to
be on fire. No words can tell what I suffered.
My whole nervous system broke down.”
The nerves are usually the first to break down
in ill-health, as Miss Lucas found, for they are the
most delicate part of the system. When they do
not get enough nourishment, they grow unstrung,
fretful, and painfully tender. Then any acids in
the blood irritate tiie delicate fibres, set up in-
flammation, and send the piercing pains shooting
through the tenderest nerves. That is neuralgia
—cruel, burning, nagging, agonising neuralgia,
making life unbearable. If Miss Lucas had only
recognised that all her suffering was caused by the
blood in this way, she would have taken Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills immediately to make new
blood for her, drive the painful impurities out of
her veins, and build up her whole health.
“My health went to pieces,” Miss Lucas con-
tinued. “My appetite disappeared. I grew thin
and weak and miserable. I had neither heart nor
strength for my house work. I was simply worn
out with pain.
“When everything failed to give me any relief
I gave up hope,” added Miss Lucas'. “But my
mother said I must take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
and give them a fair trial, too. The first box gave
me an appetite, and made me feel better in fifty
ways. Gradually the pains eased up, and I
gained in health with every dose. Before four
bixes were finished I was rid of every trace of
Neuralgia. You can see what perfect health I
am enjoying to-day—and I owe it all to Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. When they cured me they
cured the worst case of Neuralgia a man or woman
could have.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People never
fail to cure Neuralgia, because they go right to
the root of the trouble in the blood. They don’t
tinker with symptoms—they simply root out the
cause, and bad blood is the one cause of all
common diseases like anaemia (bloodlessness),
eczema, paleness, headaches, neuralgia, sciatica,
rheumatism, lumbago, backache, kidney com-
plaint, liver trouble, biliousness, indigestion,
general weakness, and the special ailments that
only women-folk know. Bad Blood is the one
cause—and Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are the one
cure, because they actually make new blood. They
do just that one thing, but they do it well. But,
of course, you must get the genuine Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People—2s. 9d. a box, six
boxes 15s. 3d.—from retailers or, post free, from
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Queen’s Place,
Sydney. Medical advice given free.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
C. C. Kingston, alas, is still very sick, and
few are allowed to see him.
On her own statement, Melba will be 40
on May 19th.
Said in Maoriland that “Dick” Seddon
has been suffering for some time from ‘ ner\ ous
degeneration of the brain.” It is a charitable
explanation of his S’African war policy.
Barrister Curlewis, husband of Ethel
Turner, does a little in literature on his own ; a
clever series of law sketches, “ The Mirror of Jus-
tice,” in Sydney D.T., are from his pen.
The most typical remark made to
mier Reid while he was “doing’ the West came
from Mayor Keenan, of Kalgoorlie, who told him
that the public didn’t want politics from him, but
expected him to be funny. He tried to oblige
them.
The last words of Oscar Wilde :
Just before he died he came to, after a long period of
unconsciousness, and said to a faithful friend who sat by
his bedside : “ I have had a dreadful dream ; I dreamt
that I dined with the dead.” “My dear Oscar,” replied
his friend, “ I am sure you were the life and soul of the
party.” “ Really, you are sometimes very witty,” replied
Oscar Wilde, and went off into his last unconscious phase
with a smile on his lips.
In the M‘Donald murder trial at Goulburn
the three lawyers engaged—W. Tighe (Crown-
Prosecutor), Sid. Mack, and W. F. Richards, for
defendant—were all fellow students at Sydney
University, and fellow-inembers of the football
team. First and last played three-quarters with
the team; the second was captain.
Major Lenehan, restored to his military
rank and dignities, commanded his old battery at
the Easter camp in N.S.W.
A few weeks ago Dr. A. Nash, of Lambton
(N.S.W.), died from blood-poisoning contracted
whilst treating a miner patient. His successor,
Dr. Leslie, had scarcely started practice when he
contracted plague whilst post-mortem- ing a plague
patient, and is now in a serious condition.
Of an astronomer and weather-prophet
now definitely retired let this story be told
for the last time. His handsome girls were
noticed once carrying umbrellas on a fine
day. “Has your father forecasted rain?”
asked an acquaintance. “Oh, no ; it’s not pa’s
prophecies, but ma’s corns we rely on. They’re
aching to-day.”
The unhappy, Pope-liaunted Watchman
has rounded on Carruthers and accuses him of
going over to Rome, because of his temporary
appointment of Coghlan to the N.S.W. Agent-
Generalship.
For the Rhodes scholarships, Queensland,
Westralia, and Tasmania have this year
nominated schoolboys. S’Australia nominated
a junior school teacher, 'Victoria has
selected a qualified doctor, while N.S.W.
has not yet decided, though it looks
like going to a graduate. Clearly,
as indignant persons have
pointed out, this is con-
trary to Rhodes’ express
wish, as he wanted school-
boys in their teens, but
it is cause for rejoicing as
far as Australia is con-
cerned. The graduate of
22 or 23 is far less likely,
when he goes to Oxford,
to fall a victim to the
sirens of Imperialism, far
more likely to remain a
national Australian.
Dr. Gibney, R.C.
Bishop of Perth (W.A.),
who gets himself particu-
larly disliked among the
’Groper families through
his outspokenness over
the treatment of the abo-
rigines, habitually goe3
amongst the wild
blacks out West
unarmed and un-
protected i n
any way ; and
has learned
thereby just
what is the
truth about them. He
is the Dean Gibney
who, at the “ Siege of
Glenrowan,” in spite
of Superintendent
Sadlier’s efforts to pre-
vent him, risked being
shot by running up to
the blazing building to
offer help to the wounded
inmates, and saw, through
the windows, the bodies of
Steve Hart and Dan Kelly lying
side by side. As only ashes were re-
covered later, the dean’s was the only evidence of
the bushrangers’ deaths.
N.S. W. Minister Hogue has a Liquor Bill
for the coming session. He announces that “bar-
maids are not to be abolished, but an age limit for
barmaids is to be fixed.” At which end? Is the
barmaid to have the fangs of youth drawn, and
only innocuous old ladies serve the foaming beer ?
Or does Abe Lincoln Hogue propose a master-
stroke of statesmanship by banning the aged
barmaid ?
Alan G. Pendleton, S.A. Commissioner of
Railways, is 68 years old. He came to S. A. in
1876, when there were only 300 miles of line in the
State.
Policeman Robert Mayne, who died, last
week, at 93, enjoyed his pension from the N.S.W.
Police Fund for nearly 30 years. He spent 30
years in the force in England and N.S.W.
There still survive, in a cottage in North
Perth (W.A.), three members of the old Fenian
Brotherhood, sentenced to transportation nearly
40 years ago. The cottage is a gift of admirers of
their cause.
Barrister Halliday, of Sydney, abandoned
Law for the Church last week, and this week Mr.
J. J. E. Done, of N.S.W. Taxation Department,
resigns the official file for an ecclesiastical career.
Rabbi Landau, who recently resigned his
post, occupied for 12 years, at the Great Syna-
gogue, Sydney, is now Superintendent of the
Young Men’s Hebrew Association of Boston.
Ernest Blackwell, whose work was once a
feature of Australian journalism, but who gave up
the pen for the forceps, is now established in
Macquarie-street, Sydney, which is, so to speak,
the Mecca of the doctor and dentist.
Back in Sydney just now for a holiday,
Frank M‘Comas, who, after doing good work in
Australia, migrated to the United States, wliere
his landscapes show, and sell, among the best.
“F.” : The old King’s School boys (Syd-
ney) have been celebrating. Are there no Cape
School boys left ? Mr. Cape was the recognised
teacher of his time, and educated more men who
have made a mark in Australian history than did
the King’s School.
Father Hays, the R.C. temperance advo-
cate, has fallen out with the R.C. Church folk in
M.L. In Australasia the R.C. officials show very
little sympathy with the extreme liquor party,
reckoning that a little grog is not inconsistent
with spirituality.
“B” : Reid’s influence in politics is
shrinking because as Federal half-Premier he
thinks it necessary to put on an over-serious look,
aud to drop the political clown and burlesque
style. As a humorist, Reid was a successful
politician ; without the antics, Reid is mere mud.
The 135th anniversary of Cook’s landing at
Botany Bay was celebrated last week. Premier
Carruthers instituted the Kurnell ceremony, and,
to listen to the small knot of partisan politicians at
the celebration, one would think that it was Mr.
Carruthers who struck Kurnell 135 years ago.
Died at Unley, S. Aus., the other day, old
“Bill” Chance, aged 88. He lived on a corner
known as “Chance’s.” He grew the first
tomatoes cultivated in S. Aus., sometime about
1839; and pioneered the condiment-making busi-
ness which, later on in S.A., grew to a very
respectable size.
Garcia, the inventor of the laryngoscope,
celebrated his 100th birthday last month. The
scientific world gave him a banquet in London.
He chatted pleasantly with those about him,
smoked his cigarette and drank his lager beer with
relish. The banquet was long and he stayed late,
but was none the worse.
Identification by a woman is coming to
count for very little in the law courts. Another
man has been released by the British Government,
after serving seven months out of a year’s
sentence, for obtaining money from women by
false pretences. The case is almost identical with
that of Adolf Beck, except that the right man has
not been found. The one sentenced (who is now
clearly shown to have been far away when the
frauds were worked) was positively “identified”
by several women victims. So was Beck.

Witnesses are now regularly seated in the
Sydney District Courts while giving evidence.
The same consideration might be shown them
in the Supreme Court. Chief Equity Judge A.
H. Simpson, by the way, prefers to stand while on
the Bench. As he descends into a well behind his
desk, this is only noticed when he is enter-
ing or leaving his court.
Gov. Talbot, in Bendigo last week, stated
that he had just received a letter from King
Edward asking him to write and tell his Royal
Nibs “ all about Victoria.” Somebody must have
been talking to Edward about the awful results of
“Socialism” in Australia, and he wants to know
whether Talbot and the Government are in
imminent danger of being dynamited. One would
like to read Talbot’s description of Bent.
What has become of the blessedness of
Mafeking night ? Melb. daily papers, telling all
they know against the suspected Girgaree mur-
derer, publish from their Rutherglen correspon-
dents the information that when he was in that
town he attracted the attention of the police
‘ 1 owing to his frequenting the company of returned
cohentingenters.” Sample of police evidence of the
near future : “ He’s continually consortin’ with re-
turned S’African soldiers an’ convicted criminals.”
Miss Elizabeth Driver, one of the oldest
natives of N.S. Wales, died last week, aged 81.
She was the daughter of Richard Driver, himself
a native, and grand-daughter of John Driver, one
of the very earliest settlers. In 1809 Lieut.-Gov.
Foveaux gave John Driver a grant of land in Cas-
tlereagh-street, then known as Camden-street,
which for some time previously he had held on
lease, and where he had a general store. He was
also one of 20 licensed by Governor Macquarie in
1810 as a hotel-keeper.
In the old days Victorian Chief Justice
Fellowes used to walk to his home at St. Kilda,
and writer npticed him one day absent-mindedly
kicking along an old tin-can for a hundred yards
or so. It was a boyish trick, and showed in the
old man a valuable capacity for keeping up the
habit of rolling on the grass occasionally. The
present Chief Justice of Victoria also walks home
to St. Kilda, but you never see him kicking a tin-
oan along.
The other day a Melb. sporting journalist
made the mistake of trying to light his pipe on
the outskirts of a crowded tram-car just as the
dummy made a sweep round a curve, with the
result that he dived off the conveyance, landing
on his frontal bone. He was gathered up and
taken to hospital to be stitched. His first request
on recovering consciousness was for his pipe. He
was told that'it had been broken to fragments in
the fall. Ten minutes later a fit of coughing
seized the patient, and he coughed up three-and-
a-half inches of pipe-stem. The bowl is still
missing.
An appeal has been received by the Maori-
land Health Department from 15 expectant mothers,
at Kahaihi, away back in Auckland province. Their
restricted means prevent them from going to-
Auckland for child-birth, and they ask that a
doctor and midwife should be sent up to them.
The request is not likely to be refused; 15 new
citizens are worth the expense.

A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION.

“ B ” : Concerning the presence of body
hair on men. I have noticed among bathers that
even those almost hairless about the legs, arms,
and trunk up to 40 years almost invariably begin
to grow hair thereon after attaining middle age.
“ Vy vyene” is wrong in thinking that the baring of
the skin does not induce the growth of hair.
Apart altogether from the effect which light and
air undoubtedly have in stimulating plant growth
(the hair is surely a plant), there are other factors
to be considered—the removal of the hair by the
friction of clothing, and the demand of the un-
covered skin in all save tropical climates,
for the covering of its natural protector—the
hair.
“Arch”: If bald-headedness is due to
hair-cutting (“Thickhead,” B. 13/4/’O5), how is it
that a man never gets bald-faced through shaving ?
In 50 years of shaving a man of ordinary beard-
growth will have removed 50ft. of face-hair.

with advantage, test the Rodier system of rabbit
extermination— i.e., netting the land, and then
waging war against the does only. An experi-
ment would not cost more than £lOOO, and the
idea of it seems to be scientifically reasonable.

“Bannis”: At frequent intervals along
the W.A. rabbit-proof fence are small enclosures
intended as traps for bunny when he should
arrive. He hasn’t turned up, but numerous
other small animals, such as kangaroo-rats,
are trapped. A man just returned from a horse-
hunting trip along the fence tells a pitiful tale of
these captives—some dying, some apparently just
got in, many with the hide worn off the skull
through beating the head against the enclosing
wire-netting. The doors of the traps were locked
so the bushman could do nothing to relieve them.

The rabbit pays if you know how to catch
him. And he is a fat enough rabbit if you catch
him in the right place. A War&nga (Vic.) man
and his two sons—three experienced rabbiters—
claim to have sold over £lOOO worth of bunny
during the last 12 months.

“G.P.8.” : Re animal suicide. In ’9l, I
sold a knowing old prad to a shepherd, who rode
him 35 miles, and then turned him out, on a
winter’s morning, without the feed of chaff to
which he was accustomed. The horse thereupon
lay down in a creek that had barely a foot of water
in it, and deliberately drowned himself.
* * * *
“ W.P.8.” (ominous initials) : Re animal
suicide. I had a cat and dog, who were great
friends. One day they picked up a poisoned bait,
and the cat died ; but with great trouble I
managed to save the dog. As soon as he was able
to walk about he dug up pussy, devoured her, was
thus re-poisoned, and died. Now, did that dog—
inconsolable for the loss of his friend —choose
death at the hands of one he loved ? [Or did he
have the usual dog’sAaste for carrion ? Fancy the
decadent, over-civilised state of mind of a dog that
would think out that form of suicide !—Ed. B.]
» * * *
“ S.D.” : Re dingo-poisoning in the sheep
districts. Only the most cunning survive, and
they are almost impossible to get at. But in
localities where they do little harm and are little
molested they are easily poisoned or shot. I
walked up to one recently in heavy rain and killed
it with No. G shot.

“Vigilans”: Land set-
tlement is on Westralia’s pro-
gramme, but the Government
shies at water conservation
on the stock routes. Re-
cently took 35 horses from
Fowler’s Bay (S.A.) to Cool-
gardie (W. A.). From Fowler’s
to Eucla (240 miles), the S.A.
Government has placed every
30 miles a cemented under-
ground tank, holding 70,000
gal., and sheds in between
with five lOOOgal. tanks in
each shed. In Jurie last these
were all full and running over.
On the Groper side, from
Eucla to Eyre’s Sand Patch
(100 miles), there is not a
Govt, tank of any descrip-
tion. The only station can’t
spare water, and the kan-
garoo-hunters and sandal-
wood-hewers have only small
catchments made in the cliffs.
We had to water our mob in
ones and twos at the few
rockholes we came across.
For 120 miles the route lies'
under the cliffs, and there is a
splendid catchment, yet noth-
ing is done: Very many who
have attempted to take stock
across have lost the lot in the
warm months. One man left
Yallata station with 5000
sheep, and arrived at Cool-
gardie with 1000 ; and a team-
ster lost 15 horses, and rode
into the gold town with one,
leaving the waggon behind.
Near Eyre’s there is an old
tank belonging to a starved-
out squatter. This is full of
dead rabbits, and the water is
putrid. From Eyre’s you
travel 90 miles through the
wilderness without getting a
drink. At the 90 Mile there
is a Govt, tank holding 10,000
gals.—the first in 250 miles. You ascend
the cliffs here to Ikilladonia, 80 miles. There is
one tank in between. Many people start on this
track without knowing how it is watered, trusting
to Providence; and everything perishes. The
country being of a sandy nature, there are no
natural catchments or waterways. Although it
rained every day when I went through we could
not get a drink for ourselves, let alone stock, and
had to carry water with us.

“ Look here, I found this child wandering in the

“I’m blanked if I know who he is. Yer see, when

1200 swam the Namoi, in flood, and got safely

“Kolonga”. To “Eiddal” (B. 23/2/’O5)
about harvesting up Kyabramapootra. So the
boy up for the holidays takes in 85 bags a day
easily, does he ? And mother sews the bags ? A
few facts from one who has been at the game : To
take in 85 bags per day he would require two
teams, of eight horses each (and pretty free goers),
about a 10-bag per acre crop, a man to relieve him
for dinner, and bed and water change of horses,
and easy-going land. A bag-sewer would be kept
pretty busy if he “ topped-up ” the bags properly,
and mother would be kept busy attending to the
commissariat department, while the “ boy ” could
look to the spare horses.

“ Rita 5.,” with the bright, ruddy glow
of the Easter feasting on her imagination :
Only felt sorry for a snake once in my life. Barney,
our pig-man, landed home with a clutch of native com-
panions’ eggs—four beauties. He commandeered Biddy,
our perpetual brooder, and covered her in a box with a
strip of coarse wire-netting, after setting her to incubate
those eggs. When we caine home from church yesterday
we found Barney in the throes of despair, for while he
was looking after the dinner, Scaly, our pet carpet snake,
and vermin-exterminator, got in* through the wire and
swallowed tfie eggs, notwithstanding Biddy’s protests.
After Scaly had dined he couldn’t retire the way he had
come —he looked like a big necklace—so the circus was in
full swing when we arrived. Barney wanted to exter-
minate Scaly, to save the eggs, but dad objected. He’d
“ rather have a snake than a bird about the place, any
day.” After dinner Biddy’s antics again attracted our
attention—she and Scaly had always been pals. Just as
we arrived on the scene a tragedy occurred. What with
the gastric juices and the warmth of the snake’s innards,
those eggs had hatched, and Scaly was in trouble. His
contortions were painful to behold. Then a native com-
panion chick’s beak appeared through his bulging side,
followed by the other three —a few struggles and they
broke loose. Dad’s concern was about his pet; Biddy’s
joy was intense. With a sack needle and twine Dad
undertook to patch Scaly up—so he administered a dose
of chlorod.vne to ease his wriggles, and tied his head and
tail to different posts to keep the patient in position. Dad
made a good job of the stitching, and he has hopes our
pet will pull through, but he’s very limp.

“ P.Q.F.” : We were surprised, the other
day, when a wild, unbroken filly walked into the
kitchen. Turned her out, and in a few minutes
she began to tremble, and soon died. Found
afterwards that she had been bitten by a tiger-
snake. I have heard it said that a horse, when
bitten by a snake, will make for the sound of
men’s voices.

“ Nymsie ” : Two questions for aborigina-
liars. Every trevalla caught off Warrnambool
has in its mouth a large whitish grub—sometimes
two. What function does this parasite"perform in
piscian economy ? No. 2 : How is it that while
some of the perch caught in lakes Terang and
Elingamite are poisonous, perch of the same
species caught in Mt. Emu Creek, near by, are
wholesome ?
“Leonardo”: I
fancy Maoriland
has more deaths
from drowning
than any other
place of its popu-
lation this side of
the line. Last year
the total was 247.
Still, after seeing
theaverage Maori-
land river, it isn’t
worth while won-
dering why the
man who gets in
generally stays in.
Many of the tidal
rivers rush in and
out with a five or
six knot current,
and there is often
a moving bed of
shingle below the
current, and once
in the grip of these
waters it is like
struggling with a
wet boa-constrictor,
and a quicksand and
the father of all
squids at once. An
old settler at Wairoa
told me that in his
earlier life it was nothing
unusual for two or three
men to be drowned in the
local river in a single week.
These were the days when
the white man was drunk
in Tussock Land—violently
whisky-drunk, not peacefully
beer-drunk; and when he
waded with a howl of chal-
lenge into the swollen ford
on his way home, he went
down waving his bottle to the
last. Once my friend noticed
a punt, apparently empty,
sprinting down the river and
doing weird gyrations in the
current. He pulled out and
intercepted it. It was half
full of water, and lying on the
bottom were four drowned
men with many empty bottles
washing about above their heads.

“ Vigilans ” writes from Sheol :
Wyndham, Duraektown, The Dead Finish —it’s all one.
Situated on the banks of Cambridge Gufll (W.A.), and
half surrounded by high hills, the place is a perfect
inferno for six months. The heat is awful by day and
night. All day you are covered with flies, and at night
the swarming' mcsquitoes and sandflies render a cheese-
cloth indispensable. To strike this place at night would
puzzle the uninitiated. Everyone sleeps under a small
cheese-cloth net in the street, while huge cow-dung fires
are burning all around. Lamps have to be extinguished,
otherwise insects would do it for you. The gaol holds
sometimes as many as 200 niggers. In the day-time they
go about in twos and threes, making roads, with a chain
round their necks, and at night they sleep chained toge-
ther by the wrist. Strings of niggers are continually
being brought into Wyndham, who have done no wrong ;
but then the police are allowed 2s. sd. each nig. per day.

“Bandar” : Watering my garden the other
evening I turned the hose on to a red (meat) ants
nest. Immediately a column of ants swarmed up
the hole. About an inch below the surface they
wedged themselves into a compact mass, com-
pletely plugged up the hole, and so stopped any
water descending. The mass resembled the old
Roman “tortoise.” I got some nearly-boiling
water and poured it down the hole. But the
“tortoise” never budged. The ants died at their
posts like heroes. Were they too tightly wedged
to move, or did they agree to die to save the
nation ?

“ Caber ” : “ Binga ” (B. 10/3/’O5) growls
about paying 3s. per acre for ringbarking, then
“Arp” (23/3/’O5) explains that that was because
“ suckering ” had to be done four times. When the
disputants have tried ringbarking anything more
substantial than thistles, they’ll know that the
price of killing forests depends upon their dense-
ness. I have seen miles of country where 9d. per
acre would pay handsomely. As for “ suckering ” :
when the sap is up, a tree “ girdled ” dies at once.
But if only ringbarked when the sap is at the root,
suckers always follow. If trees are “girdled ”
(i.e., have a ring cut in the sap-wood after the
ring of bark is stripped) at the proper season of
the year, the odd florin per acre can be saved to
help build our own locomotives with our own
workmen.

“11.P.A.” : Be long distance bike-riding,
“ D.H.R.” (B. 6/5/’O5) mentions good roads for his
records, but here are some records of heavy, dusty,
blacksoil roads in our droughty Western Queens-
land which will compare favorably : —Tom Kerr,
a well-known shearer, rode from Longreach to
Tangorin, 140 miles, 15 hours; from Pambridge
to Longreach, 300 miles, without any sleep, in 41
hours; his last feat was from Longreach to
Bimerah, 92 miles, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., and
takes beating. He always carries a swag weighing
30 to 401bs.

“ Jimpan ” : Said the bloke with whiskers
on his ears : —“ ’Twas on one of them plains that s
all covered with dead spear-grass. Not a bit a
wood about, or bark—not even saltbush. I fills
me billy from me water-bag, gethers a big heap of
dead grass, lights it, an’ the fire starts off aerosst
th’ plain in a thin, red line. I toilers it, holdin’
th’ billy on it all th’ while, and when I’d run about
four mile th’ water begins to boil lovely. Then I
discovered I’d left me tea and sugar behind. It
was a bit a ’ard ! ”
THE PHANTOM MOB.
[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
Yes ; I’m Harry Black —“ Mad Harry ” —and I often hear
’em say :
“Oh ! he’s off, poor chap ; don’t heed him—he has seen a
better day.
He was king- of all the drovers on a dry and dusty track ;
He tried it once too often ; it’s Mad Harry—Harry Black.”
I had got a mob of cattle out beyond the back Paroo,
When stock routes were the paddocks and fences far and
few,
And the track was dry as wisdom, and the days were
scorching hot,
The beasts were dropping off like flies—l thought we’d
lose the lot.
And my mates were turning cranky—day and night with-
out a drink—
But I kept ’em to the music, and I never slept a wink.
X had to keep ’em goin’, or the beggars, beast and man,
Would have perished like a bettle in an empt}' biliy-can.
I woke and found, one mornin’, there was not a hoof
alive,
But I rode around the bodies and started on to drive.
They were bloomin’ hard to manage, but I kept ’em all
the same,
For whoever knows Mad Harry will admit that he is
game.
And I took ’em on my lonely, kept ’em movin’ on the
track,
Till the fellows who had left me one by one came sneakin’
back.
And I never swore or cursed ’em—simply let ’em take a
hand,
Till the curious way they watched me brought me round
to understand.
I was drivin’ ghosts o’ cattle—not a live hoof in the lot !
And they’d never camp a moment, though the day was
blazin’ hot.
And at night they never rested, always movin’, movin’
round, .
With a restless sort o’ movin’ and a moanin’ sort of sound.
Till at last I swore at Murphy, cursed Joe Cowly to his
teeth,
And I saw' their lips a-grinnin’ and a skeleton beneath 1
I cursed ’em both as useless, and then all at once I saw
They had travelled with the cattle, and were livin’ men
no more.
Ghost o’ men and ghosts o’ cattle, I could see ’em through
the day
In a strange and curious fashion and a hazy sort o’ way.
And at night they gathered round me till my flesh w'as all
a-creep,
And at last—l couldn’t help it—while they watched I fell
asleep.
Then they w'ent and left me sleepin’—went and left me
where I lay,
And I swore an oath I’d find ’em if I looked till Judgment
Day !
Yes, I’m Harry Black Mad Harry and I never can
forget
Those pikers from the back Paroo—l’m looking for ’em
yet !

He was one of those
big spiders of Bentesque
figure, who live in a circu-
lar shaft 4 or sin. deep and
topped-off with a lreatly-
fitting hinged trap-door.
To this door came a hornet,
and, crouching close behind
the hinge, imitated the
buzzing of a fly in distress.
Up flew the door and out
rushed the spider, only to
be grabbed by the hornet
and killed in one short
round. Hornet then drag-
ged the corpse to the creek
bank, where he had a neat
clay coffin prepared for it.

“Ramoth”: The ant inquired about by
“0.P.” (B. G/4/’O5) is not a new species ; but it
isn’t numerous, and it keeps within certain parts
of the country. Bushmen call it the “elevator
(on account of its action of elevating hind
parts), the “spider-ant,” or the “sky-pilot.’ Ihe
blacks name is “ woorlian ” (lightning), on account
of its swift motion. It lives on the minute msect
life of trees.

“ H. 8.” : During the recent out-back
plague of mice, a certain cocky caught the little
rodents wholesale in kerosene-tin water-traps.
Passing his place one day, I saw a large boiler
suspended over a fire in the back-yard, and the
old chap emptying the contents of the traps into
it. Asked him what he was doing. “We don t
waste nothin’ ’ere, mister,” he said. “No need to
buy fowls’ feed while there’s plenty o’ mice
knockin’ about.”

“C.H.R.”: According to his size, I shall
plank my stuff on the little blue-black jumper-
ant of Tasmania for sudden attention to busmens
and sharpness of attack when he gets there. I
once innocently sat down on one of his mounds.
The best plan in a case of this kind is to peel off
strictly to the skin, without asking leave. You
must take your time from the ant, and he is not a
sluggard.
A PEDIGREE.
“ Yer know that cove what butts fer Kinks ? Well , ’e was
wantin’ my mare. I asks thirty quid (would ’ave
taken five). ‘ ’Ow’s she bred?' sez’e. ‘ The same as any
other ’orse,’ says I, thinking to bluff him like, when ’e
up and sez, ‘ I think she is out of condition, by Gosh.’
And, would yer believe me, I took ’in to the pub. an
spent four bob with ’im, an’ then couldn’t knock it into
his red head that there never was no such a ’orse as
Gosh in the district! ”
“Nyvn.” : Sundry aboriginaliars, up North,
have asserted that golden perch are extinct in the
inland water-courses of their localities. Not so;
these fish are coming on better than any other
since the drought, but they’re mighty shy, have
regular hours,for dining, and generally seek their
food along sunken logs, &c. Keen of sight, they’Jl
seemingly sleep within a few feet of a “ bait,” bi t
won’t touch it if a strange shadow looms near,
Black perch are cultivating similar cussedness,
The best angling for the goldies is in the spring,
when they’re returning from spawning.
A CAMPING OUTFIT.

“Chip” : Anyone growing watermelons at
Normanton (N.Q.) may expect to find three out of
four (although looking tip-top) full of mud. White
ants bore a small hole underneath, hollow out the
melon, and fill it with earth. A remedy is to lift
the melon while small, and place an iron stump-
cap underneath.

“Mars” : One of the features of the
maps issued by Vic. Lands Department is the
mythical township. On several occasions I have
travelled over partly uninhabited country, and,
noting on the map that there was a town marked
where I should probably pass, have gone on quite
contented as regards accommodation. But the
township, on closer approach, faded into the air.
Scattered over the country are the rotted pegs of
surveyed townships (relics of the sportive fancies
of early surveyors) which have been surveyed,
mapped, named and forgotten. As an instance,
there are Stradbroke and Gifford, on Merriman’s
Creek, Gippsland; and Kinglake, near Whittle-
sea —all townships of pegs and inhabited by trees.

“ Scally ” : To wake at any required hour
is easily managed. Suppose you perch at mid-
night, and want to rise at 5.30 a.m. You have
5.j hours for snooze. Compare this time in your
mind with some similar period of your day’s work,
sav from 1.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Try to get a mental
grasp of this time, then keep thinking of it while
you’re dozing, and you’ll rise at 5.30 all right.
“C.T.” : Port Darwin hasn’t a
monopoly of the “cathedral” termite
nests (B. 2/3/’O5). On the Upper Bur-
dekin, between old Glendhu and Gun-
nawarra stations, the ordinary cofiical
yellow nests are interspersed with the
long, narrow, many-spired nests, all
facing east and west. Lower down
the river, near the Valley of Lagoons,
are some curious basaltic craters and
caves, containing plant-life not known
elsewhere. The coast and tableland
flora of N.Q. has .yet to be written up.
“ Tip” : The Bulletin (30/3/’O5)
asks if there are any well-authenticated
cases of water-finding in Australia.
One Fleming, a West Indian, residing
at Grantville, South Gippsland, has
been remarkably successful as a
“dowser” in the Bairnsdale district
during the last two months. He re-
ceives high fees, and is in great request,
but says he does not want to continue
the work, because it takes too much out
of him. Scoffers contend that he always
goes where water is, and cannot help
locating it.

“ Oktis ” : Can corroborate
“Dom” (B. 2/3/’()5) re the great pre-
valence of hydatids-disease in N.S.W.
Know several instances of hydatids in
the lung being mistaken for consump-
tion. One man was treated for the
latter complaint for five years before
the mistake was discovered. He was
operated on, and recovered.
“D.H.R.”: I have noticed that poison-
weed grows mostly after rains <jr floods and is
apparently impossible of eradication. I know a
band in the Macquarie River that was thick with
poison-weed 30 years ago ; and to this day never a
mob of stock camps there without losing some of
its number. On Stony Plain, on the Warrego
River, poison-weed first grew after the ’O4 flood,
and is still there ; but it has not spread. The leaf
is puce underneath, and green tinged with red on
top. It is known amongst carriers and horsey
men as “ tricky weed,” or “ puce devil.”
“D.H.R.”: Myall Creek estate, now
advertised for settlement, is the place of the
legend of the “ Brass well,” which Lawson
versified. Some travellers, in the early days, were
lost in the scrub thereabout. For two days and a
half they tramped without finding their way out.
Then, overpowered by thirst, they commenced to
dig in the sandy bottom of a small, dry creek.
One of them threw up shovelsful of yellow metal,
which they, in their ignorance, supposed to
be brass. The attempt to find water proving
futile, they wandered on, and at length escaped
from the scrub. Several years after, on a gold-
field, they recognised in the gold what they had
supposed to be brass, and knew that they had lost
a fortune. The legend still clings round Myall
Creek, and boundary-riders, owners, settlers,
travellers, and others whose business takes them
that way, still keep a sharp eye out for the well,
which is now supposed to be scrub-overgrown, but
still waiting the lucky finder.

“Jimmy Pannikin”: Waiting for the
coach at the Battered Pelican hotel. Outback,
I heard some travellers talking pubs and pub-
licans. Said one, 11 By crumbs ! old Mulga Mickie
wuz good-iron, lie used to set us off, when our
cheques was done-in, with a couple of bottles
apiece for th’ road.” “Ho yes,” replied another,
“he wusn’t too stinkun ; but old Mother Three-
teeth used give her departin’ boarders a bag full
of good tucker’s well as three bottles a th’ best
each.” And so it went on till Ruggy Ned rose,
stretched himself, spat copiously and correctly
into til l cat’s face, and said, “Yers can all talk
and talk, but the best publican in th’ Darlin’
country wuz Mammy Mustarsh. Last time I
done in a £lB cheque in five days, an’ she started
me up th’ Darling, 50 miles from ’ome, with three
fish-’ooks !”

“ Jay bell ” : Nothing like a drought-
resisting waterhole to rid marsupial-infested coun-
try of these grass-eaters. In ’97, in Warrego,
Paroo, and Bulloo country, ’roos and wallabies
used to travel 20 to 30 miles to their deaths.
Probably they were filled up with feed, and arriv-
ing at the water, drank till something burst inter-
nally. Had frequently to shift their carcases to
dip the water for my own use.
* • * *
“Nulla”: Re edible scrub. Was with a
survey party, near Girilambone, during a dry
time. There were gangs of scrub-cutters about, so
the sheep got to know what chopping meant;
and, when we were clearing a line through the
scrub, it was pitiful to see the starving sheep
scrambling for the fallen stuff. But we used the
220 yards chain up there, and on a hot dav, to get
a mob of sheep, and acres of scrub, tied up with
a furlong of steel-wire, was very prolific of
“ language.” Kurrajong is the best fodder (if
there isn’t a regulation re the cutting of it, there
should be), but sheep eat wilga, belar, myall,
coolabah, orange-bush, oak, and, at a pinch, box
and the tops of stringy-bark. Still the utility of
scrub-feeding is doubtful. On some trees, notably
wilga, sheep thrive at first, but after a month or
so they fall away and die, apparently from severe
constipation. And, as one Westerner put it,
“It’s cheaper to let ’em die and get a fresh lot
when she breaks.”
The most pernicious of the doxies is
paradoxy.
“ Chasselas ” : “ S.S.” (B. 13/4/’O5) refers
to Mount William Estate (Vic.) as a deserted
goldfield. A joke surely ? This estate is the
centre of S.-W. Vic.’s rotten tenant system and
the boss agricultural sweat-shop of this State,
with about GO tenants grinding in the mill. Some
40,000 acres of Mount William will, with the aid
of superphosphates, grow wheat second to none in
the Commonwealth.
The unearthing of a wondrously rich and
gaudy Egyptian tomb has revealed the fact that
black crepe was a funereal emblem way back in
the time of the Pharaohs. A gilded mask belong-
ing to one of the mummers in this tomb was veiled
in black crepey muslin. Some pieces of cooked
meat were found, each piece being stowed away in
a black box for the use of the mummy at resurrec-
tion time. The person in question seems to have
lived about half a century previous to the period
of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife.
Latest novelty in the postcard craze is the
talking card. You buy your card with a thin
gelatine disc attached, remove the latter, place it
in a talking machine, have your message recorded,
re-affix the disc to the card (or to any picture
card), and post in the ordinary way. Recipient
places the disc in an ordinary disc talking machine,
and receives the message viva voce. A London
firm promises the novelty for next Xmas at six-
pence each.
“ E.F.” gives his view :
“From 6000 to 10,000 acres is the size of the holdings
between the Natal boundary and Johannesburg ... all
the Boer instincts a»e against subdivision. . . . One longs
in travelling all the day through these untilled lands and
empty pastures to be permitted to try, for the space of 10
years', the fertilising influence of a land-tax,” writes
B. R. Wise in Tun Bui.lktix. But he avoids the very
point on which the real S’African trouble turns to-day as
it has ever turned. The lazy Boer landholders are untax-
able. They own all the earth—or nearly all of it. The
biggest farms in the Transvaal run to half-a-million, a
million, and more than a million acres each, and the sulky,
psalm-smiting lords thereof fondle their rifles at the bare
mention of the word “taxation.” They are a bloated
brotherhood of fat landlords militant, feeding with scrip-
tural texts their hatred of progress, and their animosity
to the non-landed class, by whom they have been enorm-
ously enriched. An unparalleled squattocraey cursing
the Government which fears to tax them, and nursing an
intention to fight the Government when it attempts to
tax them. N ) longer the nominal rulers of the country
thev are as much as ever the owners of it, refusing to
cultivate the soil for the employment of white labor.
Before “ the fertilising influence of a land tax” can be
tried upon the Boers, as B. R. Wise suggests, the
land will need the invasion of a tax-collecting army.
The war has done nothing to mitigate the evil of Boer
landownership in S’Africa. whereas the evil of Jew Rand-
lordism has been shockingly intensified.

“ Well, so long as there's nothin' to swear at you

A complete exposure has been made of
the brutal practice of flogging, caning, and
birching boys aboard British training ships. Such
punishments are left almost entirely at the dis-
cretion of the ships’ corporals—hardened old sea-
dogs, accustomed to the infliction of torture, and
made callous by the flogging experiences of their
youth.

The Captain
of the Household
A GOOD General knows that
his brave fellows will have
little chance of winning the
battle if he neglects to provide
them with the best, the most
modern weapons. In the same
way the good housewife sooner or
later realises that, to overcome the
horde of maladies which contin-
ually menace the health of her
little band, she must provide them
with that perfect product of
modern healing science, Scott’s
Emulsion of cod liver oil with
glycerine and the liypophosphites
of lime and soda. Scott’s Emul-
sion is a remedy which has no
equal for combating coughs and
colds, lung, throat, skin and blood
troubles, wasting diseases, and
weakness of any kind, whether in
adults or infants.
[-1
Listen for a
moment to what
Mrs. George Ave-
ry wrote us on
this subject. Her
letter is dated
July 12th, 1904,
from Wide Street,
West Kempsey,
N.S.W. —
“My little
daughter, Edith,
aged four years,
recently caught
a severe cold,
which unfortun-
ately developed
into a bad attack
of bronchitis.
From the first
she took Scott’s
Emulsion readily
and soon began
to like it and look
for it. It eased
her cough and
breathing, redu-
ced all feverish-
ness, and in a
little while it ef-
fected a thorough
and complete
cure. She is now a
fine, healthy and
strong child.”
This power of making a general
assault upon disease is cliaracter-
istic of Scott’s Emulsion. The
reason is that
Scott’s Emulsion
reinforces the vitality and thus
compels all disease or weakness of
whatsoever kind, to give ground
first, then to decamp altogether.

“G. 8.” : “G.K.”, in Bulletin 23rd March, hints that
Labor papers haven’t freedom to criticise the Labor
leaders. Some notable instances to tire contrary : When
the Liberal Labor (Federal) alliance was being formed,
the Tocsin took a very vigorous stand in opposition, and
freely criticised Watson, Hughes, and others. The
Westralian Labor Ministry has come in for a considerable
amount of advice from the Labor press. Queensland
Labor members have also received due attention from
their local paper.

Frora a recent S.M. Herald :
“ One of the most remarkable instances of hereditary
office among solicitors is that of the acting Under Sheriff
for the City of London. Tufnell Burchell sits in his
Sheriff’s court in Ited Lion Square on the bench that his
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather successively
occupied.”
Certainly remarkable. In that generation the grand-
child must have been born before his grandfather.
“Uloola” writes about the late S. Crombie Brown :
The last three years of his life were one long battle against
poverty and disease. He often thought of suicide as a
way out, but it seems he endured to the end without
availing himself of that short-cut. Brown could speak
Maori fluently, having lived six months in a Maori pah.
using the native dress all the time. At the close of the
American civil war he made a walking tour right through
the U.S. (north to south), describing the country for the
Edinburgh Daily Review. The sketches were collected
and published in book form, under the title of, 1 think,
“ From the Lakes to the Mississippi,” or some such name.
Brown was a nephew of Thomas Crombie-Brown, the
eminent botanist and authority on forestry. He impressed
me as having been, in his best days, a man of alert intelli-
gence and resourcefulness, and he was, when I knew him,

“ Shade ” : lie necessity for reporters’ union in Sydney
(B. 6/4/’O5). One was started in Melbourne over a dozen
years ago, called the Victorian Reporters Association.
Late Rbys-Jones, of Melbourne Herald, was prime
mover, and late S. V. Winter, also of Herald, was
understood to tolerate the idea so long as there
was no affiliation with the Trades Hall. The
few independent spirits on the Age joined, and two
or three Argus men signed on tentatively. A vigorous
appeal to country offices and Tasmania was made, but
very few answers were received. A silver badg'e with a
bar of navy-blue enamel inscribed “ Press ” was manufac-
tured, and sold for 2s. 6d., and the fellows who had watch-
chains hung it thereon, and flaunted it in the dazzled eye
of the police, who had been instructed by the Commis-
sioner to “recognise” it. Subscriptions and meetings
and minutes and good resolutions were regular enougn
for a while, but men’s duties interfered with attendance,
and often as not there was no quorum. This at last
caused Saturday night to be fixed upon for the
meetings, and as this was the one “ night off ”
for the majority, the majority soon gave up spend-
ing it in a hotel dining-room talking abstractions.
Somehow or other, S. V. Winter became president of the
remnants, and presently they were patched together as
a “Journalists’ Institute,” a mere monthly club affair
with a fresh set of rules. Then the Argus and
Age, from Haddon and Syme down, beamed on it.
But the council soon tired of meeting itself only, and
there were no new candidates, so it died. That was
Melbourne’s first and last effort at a reporters’ union.
Has Sydney any hope of doing any better ? It is a far
more difficult and complicated matter to well and truly
lay the foundation of a reporters’ union, I believe, than
to organise any other class of workers.
“ O’F.” : While “ comping” at Broken Hill in 1888, met
a curio in the way of travelling comps. Coming into the
B.H. Argus office, straight off the track from Wilcannia,
he was engaged, dumped his swag under a frame, and
commenced setting, with the dust of the road still thick
on him. Soon, however, he sent out for four bottles of
beer, and before he had set a stickful he had stretched
himself out on his swag and was asleep. So ended his
first night’s work. When the Argus blew put, he
wanted me to tramp to Sydney. I saw no points in walk-
ing, as we both had well-lined pockets, but he reproached
me for spurning this “ fine tucker track.”

Mr Henry Stead returns to London, giving up the
editorship of Australian Review of Reviews, in which
Mr. W. H. Judkins succeeds him.

J. E. Davidson, for many years past chief political
reporter of Melb. Argus, leaves the Conservative daily to
take up the position of associate-editor of the Weekly
Times. Davidson is a native of Detroit, U.S.A., and
served his apprenticeship to journalism on the local I ref
Press, at a time when Robert Barr, latter-day novelist,
used to do the police court for the same paper. Ten
years ago, he was private-secretary to Bigjohn Forrest,
and from that returned to presswork on the West
Australian, and thence to the Argus.

Adelaide Advertiser had a g-ood exhibit in the Chamber
of Manufactures Exhibition in that city. There was
erected the machine which printed its first issue in July,
1858, and the man (Archie Mather) then in charge of it,
but now pensioned off, was engaged in turning off on
it a four-paire daily with “ all the news of the show.
Adelaide Evening Journal is publishing a serial by a
local writer, Alice Grant Rosinan (whose verses have ap-
peared in The Bulletin). The title is “ A Stately Lady.
Mr. Langdon Bonython still has a hankering to be
called “editor” of his Adelaide paper. The man who
does the work isn’t called “ editor” in the office. Adver-
tiser employees smile picturesquely sometimes and re-
mark that the “editor” is away attending to his 1 arlia-
mentary duties. * * *

Maoriland has no less than 60 daily papers. With ft
population of less than 180,000 Auckland has a morning
and evening paper and 12 other periodicals VV ellington,
population about 50,000, has two dailies and
prints. A little place like Nelson, with 8,0(>0 people,
keeps two dailies going ; and Hokitika, Blenheim,
Wanganui, Invercargill, Christchurch, Oamaru, etc., have
all got their morning and evening news hydrants.
The Cornwall Hotel, Cameron-street, Launceston,
where John Pascoe Fawlcner dispensed the flowing rum,
is the alleged birthplace of the second newspaper
printed in North Tasmania ; first was The lasmanian
Gazette and Launceston Advertiser, owned and printed
bv an Australian named George Howe in IS2 >, which had
a short life of six weeks. In 1829 Fawkner as proprietor,
and Hen " Dowling as editor, started The Advertiser
This was'followed by The Cornwall Ciironk le
years afterwards. Both papers were absorbed in 184- hy
The Launceston Examiner, brought into existence by
Messrs Aikenbead and Waddel. „
Even reporters have moments of aberration. An Age
man once concluded a report of the visit by ex-Governoi
Hopetoun to a Deaf and Dumb .School with the statement
that “ the children gave his Ex. three cheers.^
“Viator”: The Australasian Traveller, just issued
for March, is a new paper, compounded of: th«uMelbourne
Traveller, Sydney By Road and Sea, and the Commercial
of Westralia. These were the organs of the local Com
mercial Travellers’ Associations, and all the C.T. Associa
tiona of Australasia have co-operated m the J.ra\ eller.
“Drifter” puts all this poetry and frill
around a “mash”:-
The Strand (Sydney) was bathed in electric light. From
the gloom of a passage within, I watched with straining
eyes for a face amidst the passing crowd. A man swung
jauntily round into the light. He wore a shiny black hat,
well-waxed moustachios, and the air of benevolent
geniality born of a good dinner. Suddenly I saw the
devil flash in his dark eyes. He grew erect and
alert like a tiger scenting the tender fleecy lamb.
Through the radiance with graceful, swinging steps a
girlish vision came, her dainty high heels lightly tapping
the tiles to the frou-frou of a silken skirt. Then she
saw the devil in the dark eyes. A smile, full of tender
suggestion, flitted across his face ; the spiky moustachios
curled with rapture; he heaved a tender sigh as the vision,
with a sham start of dismay, passed with quickened steps,
But one of the subtle wiles at least went home. The
dainty figure slackened pace .and finally paused before a
window. I saw the light of triumph in the eyes of
Mephistopheles. He circled towards the scented bird like
a gilded hawk. A well-bred, insinuating cough at her
gossamered elbow, and the pretty, startled face met the
glory of the devil’s smile turned full on at the meter. It
was irresistible. Then he raised his shiny hat with an air
of honeyed adoration, and the pretty bird went forth with
him out into the roaring night.
“T.D.” from London: One reason
for the degeneracy of the Londoner is proba-
bly his passion for pickles and marmalade,

POLITICAL
POINTS
Mr. Reid has announced a strenuous policy
for the coming Federal session—a discussion of
Binding Orders. Anything to avoid marching
ok'ders.
Iceberg Irvine, who seeks to enter the
Federal Parliament, would bean ideal candidate,
for the electorate that is to be eliminated by the
Seats Redistribution Commissioner.
Dooley (who must have heard Dan
O’Connor): —
Whenever I go to a political meetin* an’ th’ la-ad
with th’ open-wumik face mintions Rome or Athens, I
grab f’r me hat. I know he’s nob goin’ to say annything
that ought to keep me out of bed.
George Reid says the first word of the
motto of his new political league will be ‘ ‘ Liberty. ”
George’s conception of liberty has been put by
another statesman: “I shall never rest, gentle-
men, until every man in this State is free to do as
I damn well please.”
“In that speech Mackinnon laid the cop-
ing-stone of his downfall.”— Bent, on his political
rival.
Rumored now that Mr. George Turner is
tired of Mr. Reid and his fake cry of anti-
Socialism, and will shortly retire from the Cabinet.
It would be a wise decision. Better to walk out
than to be thrown out with Mr. Reid a month or
two hence.
A SLEEPING SICKNESS.
“Has the sleeping sickness come to Australia?”—
Daily newspaper heading.
Well, politically speaking, Yes!
One sorrowful result of the absence of
“live” politics in S. Aus. is a big crop of candi-
dates who trade on the pressing need of a culvert
over Dry Creek. But this sort of thing will pro-
bably end in good. A Parliament elected on a
culvert basis will, sooner or later, be confined to
culvert business, the rest going to the Australian
Parliament.
Mr. Reid has again defined his attitude on
the tariff question. It is, in brief :
There must be no attempt to interfere with the tariff.
A fiscal truce must reign.
But there is no reason why there should not be any
number of tariff changes to correct anomalies.
At Perth and Adelaide Mr. G.’H. Reid
didn’t even succeed in being funny. The anti-
Soeialism campaign is clearly hopeless.
You can tell a man, or a paper, by his
friends —or the friends he aspires to. Melbourne
Argus optimistically forecasts :
With tact on our part, there should be no real reason
why Great Britain’s ally (Japan) should not become our
permanent friend.
The decision of the Victorian Cold Tea
party to oppose the Labor party’s announced
policy of nationalising the liquor trade again
illustrates the fact that genuine liquor reform is
about the last thing many “temperance” folk
want. Campaigning against liquor is too pleasant
a game to have its existence endangered.
H. J. Scott, an Adelaide business man,
who represented Australian producers at the
S’African Exhibition, is back in S. Aus., with the
same story of how “the Empire” was “had.”
The Government of the Transvaal is, he says—
a council formed principally by nominees of the Chamber
of Mines, who make laws and regulations to suit them-
selves.
He went to S’Africa an Imperialist; but—
justice was more favorable to the people under Kruger
than it is under the present system of Government, under
which the control is in the hands of Jewish financial
houses ; and I have no hesitation in calling myself a pro-
Boer, and in stating that the condition of British subject s
in the Transvaal is worse to-day than it was under the
Government of the Transvaal Republic.
That section of Sydney Single-tax League
which is sincere and not merely a wing of the Con-
servative ex-Freetrade party, has decided to
abjure Mr. G. H. Reid and all his wiles.
Premier Butler, of S. Aus., is developing
G. H. Reid’s pretty talent for repartee. 1 He con-
vincingly answered one interjection, in the course
of his policy-speech, with “Put your head in a
bag!” and to another remarked, “Oh, you ought
to have been hanged long ago.”
Sydney D.T., which, a little while ago,
was actively backing up the Protestant Defence
Association in its campaign against “ Rome in
politics,” now daily quotes with eager approval
the opinions of Popes, cardinals and bishops
against Socialism as a means of fighting the Labor
party.
London Daily Mail lately printed the
fine screed of an alleged Australian who called
himself “Anti-Socialist,”
and declared there was
no opening in Australia
for farmers “until the
cost of labor is lowered,
taxation lightened, rail-
way freights reduced,
and our enormous public
debt lifted off our shoul-
ders.” How this amazing
ass is going to lighten
the “enormous public
debt” by cutting down
railway freights and re-
ducing taxation he
naturally didn’t mention.
Apparently he reckons
that you can get rid of
a load by shooting the
horses and taking off a
wheel.
The political achieve-
ment which old John
Darling (he was born
in Scotland, and was a
“merchant prince”) re-
membered with the keen-
est satisfaction was that
his first election to the
S.A. Assembly cost him
less than 30s.
The awful Bent
frankly refers to himself
as member for Brighton
in the first place and
Premier of Victoria
afterwards. Touching a
Brighton complaint
about the railway service
on the Mordialloc line
Bent remarked : “My
constituents are up in
arms and I’ll have to try
to get something done.”
Let any other local poli-
tician came along with
a complaint that his
constituents are worry-
ing for something to be
done and Bent assumes a
broad public attitude and
says he’ll see’em warmed
up first.
The Royal Commis-
sion appointed to inquire
into the administration
of the N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Lands should, so
far as abuses are con-
cerned, inquire exhaus-
tively into all land
exchanges, improvement
leases, and settlement
leases, and into all the larger cases in which land
agents have gone between applicants and the
department.
The Sydney convention of the A.N.A. has
resolved to take steps to have a national holiday
fixed, to be celebrated throughout the Common-
wealth. The A.N.A. would be better employed
in getting the Commonwealth worker more employ-
ment instead of another holiday.
In the verandah of Melbourne G.P.O. has
lately been put up a penny-in-the-slot post-card
machine, which works satisfactorily, and relieves
the clerks inside of all post-card sales. Why not
extend the system to stamps —Id., 3d., 6d. and Is.
stamps could be sold thus, and they would cover
practically all postal demands. An automatic
weighing machine and a clerk to answer queries
and sell the larger denominations of stamps would
then meet all requirements.
“ D.H.R.” : How humiliating is it for an
Australian to go on his own show-ground! On
every side he sees the wares of foreigners—the
American plough, boiler, traction-engine, scoop,
windmill, pump, and a thousand and one other
accessories of farming industry. The boiler-
making industry, which, at one time, was acquir-
ing quite a footing in N.S. Wales, has been com-
pletely supplanted by the introduction of the
tubular system of producing steam—the pro-
prietors of which are foreigners. And all this on
account of our chicken-hearted tariff.
Even while the Land Boards were
sitting at Vic. back-block towns, and prov-
ing that the cry about the farmers’ po-
verty is mostly bunkum, several country
M.’sL.A., posing as farmers’ friend-,
but really friends of mortgagees and
rich landlords, interviewed Premier
Bent, and urged that blustery per-
son to stay the proceedings because
“ the farmers in arrears would have
to attend the Land Boards, and
everybody would know they were
in debt.” Thomas characterised
the request as too quaint even for
him, remarking that he 1 ad not i o-
ticed any of this shy sensitiveness
about the farmer when the G.vt.
was giving out seed wheat.
The N.S.W. Government is
still, after four or five years delay,
considering the site of a new public
library— to house the nation’s books,
including’ the Mitchell collection.
The sites under cons delation are
three —that now occupied by the
Education Department, which is
hardly sufficiently central; that in
the Domain, which is even more
out of the way, and whose loneli-
ness would debar most women from
using it after nightfall; and a posi-
tion in Cook Park—in line with tl ©
Museum —which seems, on the
whole, the best, if any park area is
taken.
The Transvaal is offered by
the English Tory Cabinet, as re-
demption of the promise of self-
government, a poor shadow of a
Constitution. There is to be a
Parliament, but the Parliament is
not to rule. Downing-street (with
telephone connection to the New Jeru-
salem in Park Lane) will still rule
through its High Commissioner. In
short, the despotism is to be modified
by running in conjunction with it a
talking-shop—a Parliament which may
talk but cannot enact.
Lever Bros., the soap people, have
returned to the N.S.W. Government the steamer
Victoria. After trial they will not purchase.
N.S.W. Premier now pins his hopes to the chance
of transferring her to the Federal Government,
and with George Turner at the Treasury that is a
cold chance.
Australian Socialist League at its annual
Conference in Sydney has again repudiated J. C.
Watson and his party as advocating “a mere
caricature of Socialism.” There have been no
leading-articles in the daily papers to impress this
fact, which, however, is an honest expression of
opinion from a revolutionary body which believes
in Socialism, full and immediate, and which has
consistently opposed the Labor Party—an evolu-
tionary socialistic organisation.
The Butter Commission of smellful
memory is to sit at Sydney during May.
Solicitor J. Woolf, who represented N.S. Wales
interests at the Melbourne sittings, will pre-
sumably continue that representation in Sydney,
and it looks as if the importation of quite a crowd
of commissioners and advocates will be necessary.
And the whole result will be to stir up again the
old smell. Australia knows all that it can
know about the butter business, and the time for
investigation should have passed : what is wanted
now is some wholesome action.
In the new Transvaal Constitution the
size of a man’s wage is to be a test of his qualifi-
cations as a citizen. The man in receipt of £lOO
per annum will have a vote, the man getting £O9
19s. 9d. will not. Which means that the bosses
are to be the judges of the political rights of men.
There were strong enough undercurrents already
in existence to encourage the Landlords to keep
down wages ; the knowledge that the wretch they
give £2 a week to may vote against their pet rob-
beries will doubtless prove yet another.
S.M. Herald is gradually swinging to
Protection. From its yarn on the local manufac-
ture of locomotives: —
The obvious reflection here suggested is that if the com-
petitor abroad can afford to cut his prices in this way to
secure our trade, and prevent us from building up an
industry of our own, the Government of this State can
make a corresponding sacrifice to protect these two ad-
vantages.
Precisely; “the obvious reflection” is that Pro-
tection is the best policy.
At the “Jubilee meeting” of that gilt-
edged investment concern, the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co., the chairman moaned as usual over
conditions (they were paying a 15 per cent, divi-
dend, and declaring just twice the profits shown
only five years ago). “In Queensland,” he
said, “the farmers have been unable to learn
anything as to their fate concerning the
employment of colored laborers.” Well, their
uncertainty is their own fault. Australia has
spoken plainly enough, anyway. It may stand a
who Yes-Noes on some things; but
even he hasn’t got nerve to Yes-No on the question
of a White Australia. But what these planters
ought to know is the fate of the white-sugar bonus.
Parliament owes it to them to settle that, and let
them make their plans.
A recent Henniker Heaton letter to the
Commonwealth P.M.G. was the quintessence of
drivel. “ I hope you have seen your way to meet-
ing the wishes of the people of this country (Hen-
niker’s adopted Hingiand) by allowing us to send
letters to Australia for a penny each. It will give
us great pleasure if you are able to do so.” Apart
from a few scores or hundreds of exporters who
carry on an extensive business correspondence
with Australia, the public of Great Britain takes
little or no interest in the question of postal rates;
90 per cent, of the population will not care six-
pence a year whether a half-ounce letter goes for
a penny or twopence - halfpenny. The large
majority will live and die without knowing that
the rate has been reduced. They never send a
letter to Australia.
“ Anti-Socialism ” hasn’t materialised yet
in Westralia, but it’s coming—Bigjohn Forrest
will see to that. When it does arrive it will be
the prize joke of the Commonwealth. For these
are some of the anti-Socialistic things the farmer
gets in Groperland :—• __
Stud bulls, State flour-mills, State grain-sheds, agricul-
tural society grants, free copies of the Agricultural
Journal, free aid from State agricultural, viticultural,
horticultural and poultry experts, free parasites for fruit
disease, free instruction at State farms, differential rail-
way rates, and cheap loans from the State Agricultural
Bank.
Also, in two or three favored districts Govt, pays
men for clearing land, then gives farmers the land,
gets them credit at the store, pays a man for
instructing them, hands them a loan from the
Agricultural Bank, and provides facilities for
getting their stuff to market. Yet, of course, it
will be the farmer whom Bigjohn will expect to
get most of his “anti-Socialistic” support from.
"AHEM!”
1ST BAD LOT: “ Yes, she is a jolly clever little
actress. I have endeavored to see her in
everything .”
2ND DO.: “ Well, I've seen her in nothing !”
Said, on very good authority, that the last
N.S.W. Government intended to abolish the
N.S.W. Land Court—about the only judicial
bulwark the State has against Lands mal-adminis-
tration. The Royal Commission might investi-
gate that report, and ask “ why? ”
What has become of the scheme, fathered
by Mr. Farnell, of establishing steam trawlers on
the Australian coast, and giving the State a cheap,
and plentiful supply of fish ? Some years ago a
Government steamer trawled about N.S.W. coast-
line, with Mr. Farnell at the helm, and succeeded
in destroying the life’s happiness of many fish.
As a result, the State was promised that private
enterprise would step in and catch fish for it aIL
day long. But, having paid for the experiment,
the State has heard no more. Mr. Farnell has
caught a well-paid State billet, private enterprise
is busy writing to the papers on anti-Socialism,
and fish is dearer than ever.
Mr. Gr. H. Reid is somewhat too artful.
Since Mr. Deakin shows a natural reluctance to
join him on the anti-Socialist platform, Mr. Reid
announces that that platform is to be exactly the
same as was promulgated by Mr. Deakin at
Ballarat when the National Political League was
formed. In fact, the National Political League
programme Mr. Reid adopts holus-bolus. But the
artifice is too obvious. Mr. Deakin will probably
refuse to be snared. Then what mud will Mr.
Reid throw ! The yarns Mr. Reid used to tell of
Mr. Deakin in the Petriana days will be milk-and-
water compared with the abuse that will be poured
on him a few months hence.
Vic. Premier Bent allowed the public to
gauge his sense of justice with tolerable accuracy
at an interview with ex-constable Crowe last
week. Crowe wants investigation into a case of
assault and robbery, 22 years old, claiming that
two innocent men were imprisoned for it. Bent
listened to his arguments with a tired expression,
until Crowe mentioned the word “compensation.”
Then Bent jumped up with the air of a hippo-
potamus which has sat on a barb wire fence.
“Oho, that’s it!” he bellowed; “what about
compensation, eh?” Crowe explained that he
did not seek for compensation, but only a
cancellation of the sentence. Then Bent pro-
mised to make full inquiry into the case. The
inference left was that, had compensation been
demanded, the position would have been different.
S.M. Herald’s London correspondent on
the “Stinking Fish” policy (and the Herald
itself is the leader of the Anti-Socialistic Stinking
Fish party):—
How is it, then, we are asking here, that not even tht
smallest attempt can be made to advertise the resource*
of Australia, blit someone professing to be an Australian
comes forward to do his utmost, in a venomous spirit and
in violent language, to belittle the country with which he
claims to be connected. I have referred more than once
to the very modest attempt which is being made to
familiarise the British public with Australian scenery.
The scheme, however, is no sooner launched than we find
someone writes as an Australian, and signs himself an
“ Anti-Socialist,” describing the whole arrangement in a
letter to the press as a scheme to hoodwink the British
public, and to tempt men with capital out to a sort of
earthly Gehenna, where they will simply be despoiled and
ruined by a set of political harpies.

Catarrh of the Stomach
CURED BY
VITADATIO
Ten Years’ Intense Suffering.
Call and See Mrs. Cummins.
16 Vine-street, Itedfern, N.S.W.
Dear Sir, —For ten years I have suffered from catarrh
of the stomach, suffering intense pain during the whole
time. Several times my life was despaired of, and at last
the doctor said he could do no more for me. At this
time I read your advertisement, and determined to give
VITADATIO a trial. The result has exceeded my greatest
anticipations. lam now fully recovered, and am in better
health than I have been for the past twelve years. I
earnestly recommend the medicine to similar sufferers.
You are at liberty to make what use you like of this, and
I shall feel a pleasure in answering any questions re my
complaint.
Yours truly,
(Signed) ISABELLA CUMMINS.

Mr. J. KING, Swan’s St., North Freemantle, W. Australia,^
HAS BEEN CURED
OF A SCROTAL
RUPTURE
Mb. J. KING
of 20 years 7 standiing without operation, and has dis-
carded his truss. He had suffered not only from his rupture,
but also from the effects of ill-fitting spring trusses, which caused
more pain thau the rupture. He had given up all hopes of a cure
until he heard of the Eice method. He tried it and it cured him.
Thousands of men, women and children have been cured by this
method without pain, danger or operation. Among them are
Chas. Pittner. Mossman, via Port Douglas, Queensland; Mrs.
P. Medley, 331, Swan Street, Eichmond, Melbourne; L. Exton
(child), 2, Haifold Street, Newtown, near Sydney, N.S.W.; and
J. Westhead, Elver Darling, Pooncaria, N.S.W. Your rupture
cannot be worse than some I have cured. You owe it to yourself to
at least investigate carefully this method of cure. BEWARE of
any person or ) persons claiming to be or to have been at any time
connected witli me in business in any way. Such statements are
absolutely fraudulent and devoid of all foundation. BEWARE
of all imitatioits of my method. The genuine Eice method can be
obtained from my London office only. I will send you a book
giving a complete description of rupture and its cure, and telling
why the Eice method has succeeded in so many thousands of
cases, if you will write for it. Do not be misled by worthless
guarantees, but write for my world-wide-known and tested
method. Wri be to-day to W. S. RICE, Rupture Specialist

Fit For Nothing.
Three Strong Words Which Describe John
Murray’s Condition. After He Had Been
Made a Physical Wreck.
When a man is only twenty-five years old he is
presumed to be in the pink of young manhood —
fit for anything—and if his normal condition of
health fails him and he becomes unable to work,
or attend to his ordinary affairs, he is in a position
of great seriousness. Yet that is what actually
befell John Murray, who is a resident of
Paddington, N.S.W., living at No. 12 Olive-street, j
He is tall, slender, dark complexioned, and was
born in the town of Deniliquin, on the banks of
the Murray River, twenty-seven years ago.
LET HIM TELL HIS OWN STORY.
In a letter dated December Bth, 1904, he says : .
“ For three years I was a confirmed sufferer from
indigestion and chest weakness. I took all kinds
of medicines without beneficial results, and at last
became so weak that for six whole months I had
to give up work. I attended Prince Alfred
Hospital as an out-door patient; but the treat-
ment did me no good whatever. My chest became
so bad that I thought I was in a consumption. I
dreaded to go to bed, because when I lay down I
seemed to smother, and so I would pass night after
night propped up by pillows, sleepless and longing
for the morn. I was very nervous, too, and the
least sound or noise would set my heart beating
like a steam-hammer.
HOPELESS AND A WRECK.
“As a consequence I became thoroughly hope-
less and a mere wreck of skin and bone, when a
friend, two-and-a-half years back, first induced me
to take Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I used two bottles
before I felt it was doing me good. After that,
however, my health rapidly improved. I put on
flesh, could eat and sleep, and was soon able to do
some light work. A few more bottles restored me
to perfect health. My chest is now quite strong,
and my digestion good enough for anything.”
In “perfect health” and with “digestion good
enough for anything ” is a good strong statement
of fact and indicates a strong man. Mr. Murray
is married, the father of a small family, and all of
them are made happy by his good health and
spirits.*
Home Nursing Book. —A valuable book
on Home Nursing and the treatment of the sick
has just been issued by the proprietors of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. The book covers a
very wide range, containing a mass of information
dealing with most of the complaints to be found
in a complete medical work. An important
feature is that devoted to children’s complaints,
also accidents and poisoning. The idea has been
to avoid all technical terms, and the book should
be especially valuable to those who are unable to
procure medical advice. A copy of this book will
be sent free on receipt of a penny stamp by the
W. H. Comstock Co. Ltd., 58 Pitt-street,
Sydney.*
A Heal Good Thing.— The great difficulty
hitherto experienced in obtaining, in this country,
a regular supply of fresh cream has been entirely
overcome by Messrs. Fussell and Co. Ltd., who
have placed on the market an exquisite pure
cream fresh from milk from cows fed on the high
Norwegian pastures, sterilized by a new process,
and packed in cans hermetically sealed without

A FUTILE floweret of romance had
struggled up in Lil’s heart with her bud-
ding womanhood, but its neglected life
drew but poor nourishment from her starved
nature. Joe’s ungraceful wooing, because of
this poor thing in her heart, had failed to
satisfy her, and, with a sort of dull surprise, the
young man had felt that his advances were un-
welcome. That was not the way of the girls of
those parts. When a neighbor’s son wooed one of
them, as a matter of course his suit succeeded, and
in due time the girl would leave her father’s
weatherboard for the humbler bark hut of her
husband.
Joe had persisted, more resolute for the thwart-
ing, but it is doubtful how he would have fared
had not chance come to his aid. He was assisting
Lil’s father to harvest his bit of oats, and she,
with the rest, was lending a hand with the bind-
ing. The day had been hot, and towards sunset
the girl, with aching back, having tied the last
sheaf, by way of giving vent to her satisfaction,
tossed it up into the air. A little ripe grain as it
fell was shaken but on the stubble. With a cry of
wrath at the Waste, old Dubb struck his daugh-
ter. “There’s for you, for shedding the grain
like that.”
Joe at once shot out his fist and sent him spin-
ning to the ground. Old Dubb picked him-
self up frowning, but said never a word as they
walked home together. It was after tea that Lil
came to Joe, who was sitting outside with the old
man, friendly enough. Crooking her finger she
beckoned him. Then she faced him and said,
“I’ll marry you, Joe.” As much surprised as his
bovine nature would allow him to be, Joe, remov-
ing his pipe, claimed his lover’s right; drawing
Lil’s to his own stubbly, well-washed face. And
so they had married.
Ten hard years she had served him inside the
house and out: the clearing and dwelling told of
early and late, and constant toil. And to-day he
had struck her, just as her father in the old days
had done many a time. It was the beginning of a
new life of bitterness. The young children
played around her unnoticed.
Two stood on the door-step, the father and the
eldest son, already marked with the stain of labor
beyond his years. They had come for the four
o'clock tea. She roused herself with a dull sense
of dismay. The fire, fortunately, had not gone
out, and the full kettle was simmering. She rose
and took up the teapot.
She avoided her husband’s face after the first
glance, with an instinct half resentment, half
sorrow.
His hand touched and closed over hers as he
took the pot from her. “ Leave it to me,” he said
with a little shake in his voice ; “ you go and lay
down, you look bad.” She saw in his eyes the
traces of a worse afternoon than hers had been.
She resigned the pot and obeyed him without a
word.
The woman passed into the bedroom and threw
herself on the bed. It was not to be the beginning
of another bitter epoch after all; never again,
never again would he strike her, she told herself
amid her tears. A blow had brought them together
at first'; a blow would unite them again. She
looked up ; her husband was standing before her
with a cup'of tea. She felt his bearded face touch
hers a moment. Then silently he was gone.

HOGAN eye I the horse with the air of
a connoisseur; and felt his near front
leg with a magnificent assumption of
veterinary knowledge. “Sound’s a bell,” he
announced with authority, “an’ a dam foine bit o’
hor’rseflesh, too. How’d ’oo come to git um so
chape ? ”
I laughed contemptuously.
“You fellows,” I replied, “never attend a
pound sale ; and then you grumble if you miss a
good thing.”
The new-chum bank-clerk listened anxiously.
The coach-driver walked round behind the
animal. “ Beautiful quavers,” he murmured
rapturously. “ A wee bit faulty in the shoulder;
but ’e’s quarters are something out o’ the common.
Ought t’ be able t’ jump a bit,” he added.
I agreed, and remarked that I had thought of
keeping him for the maiden hurdles at the amateur
meeting.
Then the butcher chipped-in. “If ’e’s as good
as ’e looks,” he ventured, “ there’s nothink ’ere
can arst ’im t’ gallop.”
“Oh, y’ can’t tell,” I rejoined, modestly.
“ All th’ same he looks a slippery customer.”
The bank-clerk opened the horse’s mouth and
asked the coach-driver if he could tell a horse’s
age. . ...
The driver rose to the occasion. “Basin’five,”
he announced unblushingly.
Hogan bent down to resume his veterinary
manoeuvres. ‘‘ I s’pose, ’’ he said contemplatively,
“y J wudn’t be wantin’ t’ sell ’um, wud y’? Oi
c’d do wid a hor’rse thot hov a bit o’ pace.”
“I’m afraid,” I began, “at least —that is—he’s
already under offer.” I looked hard at the bank-
clerk. Of course, if Mr. Allcuff doesn’t want
him ”
Mr. Allcuff interrupted me. “ Ten pounds, I
think you said ? ”
Hogan gasped. “ Tin pounds,” he ejacu-
lated, “for a hor’rse loike that! Tin Oh!
moi precious sowl! ” He collapsed utterly, -
I nodded assent to the bank-clerk.
“Then he’s mine!” he announced with the air
of Napoleon winning the battle of Austerlitz, and
casting upon Hogan a look of malicious triumph.
Hogan bore it with Christian fortitude. We
adjourned to the pub. to ratify the agreement.
Before he took his purchase away, the bank-clerk
shouted.
After he had gone, Hogan looked at me inquir-
ingly. I drew out one of the notes and threw it
on the counter. “I suppose it’s up to me,” I
admitted.
Hogan’s snort of disdain was powerful. ‘* He go
t’th’poun’sale,” he spluttered wrathfully, “an’
he give fifteen bob fer a dahmed owld hat-rack yez
wouldn’t be seen dead with ; an’ thin whin he

[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
MAN was looking at himself. Zeus
watched him with much interest, wait-
ing to accept his creature’s gratitude.
“I am indeed a noble person,” said the first
man. “My physical beauty is surpassed only by
my intelligenqe. In fact, no one but a person of
my intelligence could have created so perfect a
form. I don’t remember doing it, but it is quite
evident that lam self-made. Assuredly lam a
great artist.”
Zeus was a little disappointed, but tried again.
And presently the first man found himself madly
in love with the first woman. “ Adorable crea-
ture,” he exclaimed, “ you surpass my noblest
dreams ! Even my brain is incapable of making
you. There must he someone—though it is almost
inconceivable—wiser and nobler than I.” Then,
remembering vaguely a phrase he seemed to have
heard in visions, he struck an attitude of heroic
modesty, and cried, “ Let there be gods ! ” And l
man has had gods ever since.
“H-m-m-m,” said Zeus, reflectively. “Well,
they say competition is the soul of business.”

From Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.*
Frederick Harrison, Positivist, has been
fulminating against smoking, in the Bystander.
He protests against the habitual use of tobacco as
“a degrading appetite,” “a beastly disease,”
“loathsome to most women and all decent men,
and unworthy of a gentleman,” and declares that
the man is “a dirty brute who habitually smokes
everywhere and anywhere, in mixed society and
in association with ladies.”
Touching the lately-exhibited collection
of Whistler’s paintings, the judicial “Merlin” of
London Referee has something to say.
It is a good thing that a pioneer like Whistler should
at last come into his kingdom, but it is not a good thing
that a little wave of hysteria should be allowed to over-
flow and obliterate a sane judgment of his qualities
. . . the great popular rush to the collection now on view
is a thousand times more a tribute to a passing fashion
than to the faculty of a dexterous and occasionally
exquisite artist.
But this is the age of “mafficking.” Whistler
conquered the forces of ignorant prejudice, and
the mob magnifies his achievement and mafficks
over it.
“E.F.” : Amiable Wilson Dobbs defend-
ing the mutual admiration policy of the Litera-
ture Society of Melbourne, may be advised to
look up the first chapter of Oliver Wendell
Holmes’ “ Autocrat ” :
All generous companies of artists, authors, philanthro-
pists, men of science, are or ought to be Societies of
Mutual Admiration. A man of genius or an}' kind of
superiority is not debarred from admiring the same
quality in another, nor the other from returning his
admiration. And so of a dozen such men, if any one
place is fortunate to hold so many. . . . Such a society
is the crown of a literary metropolis ; if a town has not
material for it, and spirit and good-feeling enough to
organise it, it is a mere caravansary, fit for a man of genius
to lodge in, but not to live in. Foolish people hate and
dread and envy such an association of men of varied
powers and influence, because it is lofty, serene, im-
pregnable and, by the necessity of the case, exclusive.
Wise men are prouder of the title M.S.M.A. than of their
other honors put together.
Allowing a discount for his humor of exaggeration,
this represents what the “Autocrat” thought
about social gatherings of clever people who don’t
send reports of their mutual compliments to the
newspapers. At the same time he remarked
that—
Unpretending mediocrity is good, andgenius is glorious ;
but a weak flavor of genius in an essentially common
person is detestable. It spoils the grand neutrality of a
commonplace character, as the rinsings of an unwashed
wine-glass spoil a draught of fair water. . . If the Mutuals
have really nothing among them worth admiring, that
alters the question.
The question is—have the members of Melbourne’s
Literary Society anything among them worth
admiring, or are they but as vessels full of com-
monplace water spoiled by a weak flavor of wine?


Blood Turning to Water. Mrs.
Reyer de Moel, of Peabody-street,
Beimore, praises Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. Her recovery, after doc-
tors had failed, was almost a miracle.
Mrs. de Moel’s letter is as follows :—“ For some
years I have suffered with bad health, and during
the last twelve months my strength seemed to fail
me altogether. At times I became dizzy and lost
the use of my legs, and have been almost wholly
confined to my home. I dared not go far from
home for fear of not being able to get back. In
December last my skin became blotchy, and
pimples appeared all over my body. I went to
Prince Alfred Hospital, and the doctor gave me
some medicine, which, however, did not do me
good. I made about twelve visits to the
hospital extending over a period of two months,
but I did not seem to get better, and I was in
despair, ihe doctor said my blood was out of
order, and was like water, causing my flesh to be-
come puffed and swollen. Early in March a
neighbor advised me to try Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, which was a splendid medicine for
purifying and enriching the blood, and on the
followmg day my husband purchased a bottle.
After a couple of days my appetite improved,
so I decided to persevere with the pills, and took
them as directed. In the course of three weeks I
found a wonderful improvement in my health. I
seemed to gain strength daily. The pimples had
disappeared, and as I gained strength the dizziness
which I used to experience entirely left me. To-
r u a ne 'f w oman, and am enjoying the best
of health. I still take your pills on alternate days,
and recommend them to everyone. The neighbors
can all testify to my condition three months ago,
and are surprised at the wonderful curative
properties of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. You
are at liberty to use this letter in any way you may
decide so that those who are suffering as I did
may take heart and know that your pills will do
ttemgood. Kate de Moel.” These are words
that should carry weight with all women suffering
as Mrs. de Moel did. Anyone doubting the
correctness of this statement can write her at her
address, Peabody-street, Beimore, near Sydney,
and she will furnish them with any information
they may want in reference to her marvellous
recovery after doctors had failed to do her the
slightest good. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
make weak women strong and sick women well.
They get at the cause as no other remedy does,
healing inflammation, drying debilitating drains,
cleansing the stomach, driving all impurities out
of the blood, and assisting in the assimilation and
digestion of food by keeping the liver and kidneys
in proper working order.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A.J.C. Autumn meeting scraps:—Trainer of
Cup winner Tartan didn’t invest a cent; he feared the
horse would fail near the end—which, strangely enough,
was where he shone. M.L. bookmaker Bill Lyons, who
recently bought Up-to-Date for £4OO, got more than his
outlay back over the horse’s win 01 First Steeple, and will
scoop still further later. Meeting was ruinous for
backers. Reversals of form were much more frequent
than usual; principal cases being Charles Stuart, P. K.,
Fashoda, Rosemead, Long Tom, Hollette, and Rowley.
Among; owners, Mr. E. E. D. Clarke was first (three wins),
and, with brother Rupert, he was concerned in two more.
Mr. M'Master came next, through Binnia’s and Marvel
Loch’s successes. Victorian horses won all w.f.a. events.
Of £15,681 prize-money Mr. J. J. Macken (owner of Cup
winner Tartan) got £2310, Mr. W. Austin (through Don-
caster winner Famous) £1547, Mr. E. E. D. Clarke £1530,
Messrs. Clarke Bros. £1502, and Mr. M’Master £1290.
* * * •
Only three (Emir, Cherson and Overdale) stripped
for Cumberland Stakes (three miles), and they finished as
named. Emir landed the prize and the bets easily
in 3.27J —the fastest two mile w.f.a. race ever run in Aus-
tralia, only the fraction less than Tartan’s record estab-
lished in Sydney Cup on Easter Monday. It was a bril-
liant performance indeed; the last mile was thrown
behind in 1.41 J.
* * • *
W.f.a. race All Aged Stakes proved a facer for
punters generally. Nineteen of 24 in the book were with-
drawn on the course, and Gladsome was voted a good
thing, for the only other (Charles Stuart) to be seriously
considered was easily beaten in Sires’ Produce Stakes,
Saturday ; yet Charles Stuart ultimately won comfortably
in record time—l.3B—making Gladsome (previously voted
by many the best in Australasia over a mile at w.f.a.) and
thrte other top-notch milers (Sir Leonard, Ibex, and
Doncaster winner Famous) look no better Jian second-
raters. Nothing in the race had a hope with the winner
at any stage. Previous best mile figures (1.38 J) were
created by Sequence.
* * • •
Only Emir, Signature, and Lord Fitzroy saddled
up for rich A.J.C. Plate (3m.) on Saturday. The thing
looked so sure for Emir that there was practically no
betting, though some books risked a little when
backers would lay 10 or 12 to 1 on. Other two nags were
beaten pointless from end to end, and the favorite won
by over 100 yards, in s.24|sec. —lsec. worse than Austra-
lian record made by Wallace and Quiver in that often-
referred-to champion race dead-heat nine years ago.
Signature surprised muchly by just beating Lord Fitzroy
in a very wobbly finish.
* * * 0
Concluding event (Final Hep.) of the meeting
provided sensation. P.K., strongly tipped and weightily
backed for the Doncaster, Saturday week, and also tipped,
but apparently not backed by the right people, for
Wednesday’s Welter, was invested upon to such an extent
that his price shortened from 25 to 10 to 1, while punters
fell over each other to back P.K.’s stable chum, Fungus,
who started favorite in a field of 31. Near the finish the
race looked Graceton’s, but P.K. came full of running, and
beat her by 2 lengths, with ancient Lucknow third. At
the scales it was discovered that, even with the bridle,
P.K. carried Jib. short, which, of course, caused disquali-
fication, and Graceton (20 to 1 against) got the money.
Happening meant a loss of over £l6OO to the nag’s owner
(Mr. E. H. Knight), as he had £l2OO to £B3 in bets, and
the prize was worth £330. Trainer (Dick O’Connor) tells
that he weighed the rider, Quinn, in jockeys’ room, and
found him exactly right, but responsible official dis-
covered an overdose of ljlb., whereat the only piece of
lead carried was removed. Quinn is confident nothing
was lost on the trip, for the full and sufficient reason that
there was nothing to lose but himself or the saddle.
Strangely enough, same owner had a similar experience
with Moth, at Moorefield, 10 years ago.
* * * •
Death of A.J.C. judge, Mr. Chas. Perry, aged
about 48, was startlingly sudden. After getting through
the third day’s (Wednesday’s) responsibilities, Mr. Perry
was on his way to dine with a friend when paralysis
struck him down, and he succumbed a little later in the
hospital. Though under medical treatment lately, the
deceased’s condition did not indicate the possibility of
early death.
* * * *
The members of the big Sydney drapery firm of
Foy are probably finding horse-owning almost as profit-
able as softgoods. Nags belonging to the partners have,
so far this season, gathered big plums of Australian turf-
dom, as follows : Maribyrnong Plate, Anniversary Handi-
cap, Newmarket Handicap, Australian Cup and Sydney
Cup.
* * * *
Second Steeple induced 7 starters. Easy
winner (M.L. crack Up-To-Date) of first ’Chase a week
before was an absentee. Tasmanian bred young Creswick
went to the post favorite, 5 to 2 against, and won easily.
Winner took his jumps capitally all the way and 'is
evidently a good class of lepper.
* * * *
Despite that entries haven’t yet been made for
Melbourne Cup and date of race is still 6 months off, Mo
announces Charles Stuart has already been backed for
Derby and Cup double at 1000 to 30 and 40. Another
instance of how idiotic some punters are.
■****
There were only 13 starters for the big Steeple
at Onkaparinga this year, and the winner, Poster, was a
close second favorite, but he paid a dividend of £4 14s.
The third horse, Lamond, was a 20 to 1 chance, a lovely
satire on Ikey Mo betting. Would Ikey lay 20 to 1 against
Lamond in a field of 13 ?
* • * *
“The excuse for Charles Stuart’s startling “re-
versal of form ” in the Champagne Stakes was that “ he
had evidently needed Saturday’s gallop to sharpen him
up.” Exactly the same excuse was offered for the Bal-
larat colt’s similar surprise at the V.R.G. Autumn Meet-
ing. Charles Stuart is a terror for needing a defeat to
sharpen him up to winning point.
Larras Lake (there is no lake, but a confluence
of the Bell and Molong rivers), N.S.W., where so many
swift racers were bred, has been in the possession of the
Lee (Bathurst) family for 80 years. It is, probably, the
richest pasture land—chocolate soil, lime country—in the
Commonwealth, and a drought never damages it.
At the recent sale of thoroughbred yearlings, T.
,S. Clibborn, the auctioneer, through failing eyesight,
resigned the hammer to John Inglis. Mr. Clibborn had
conducted these sales for 32 years. Secretary to the
Ballarat Racing Club when Mr. Buchan Thomson’s reign
at the A.J.C. came to an end, he applied for the Sydney
billet and got it.

Jockey Carslake, who rode Famous in the Don-
caster Handicap of the A. J.C., drew £5OO for 100 seconds
work, or £5 a second. That puts opera-singers and poets
something to the rear. But even that has been beaten
£3OOO going to one jock, for a win in a 150 seconds’ race’

The 6.4 jump scored by Playmate at Sydney
Agricultural Show is spoken of as an extraordinary feat for
a pony to accomplish, hut the people who think that a
big horse should be able to jump higher than a little
horse can give no good reason for their opinion. The
piebald Playmate is strong enough to spring his own
weight into the air as easily as a heavier horse can spring
his weight. When it comes to the question of tucking
four legs across a bar, the pony has an advantage over
a longer and taller animal.

Sydney Rugby Metropolitan football compe-
tition starts on Saturday. This season will see nine com-
petitors in the first grade lists instead of eight. The
baby, and a fine vigorous infant it promises to be, is the
Sydney District Club. A Rugby Union has been formed
KIERAN, THE CHAMPION SWIMMER.
at Perth, Westralia. Maoriland University will send a
Rugby team across to N.S.W. to do battle with the
Sydney University team, which, it will be remembered,
won last season’s premiership. The status of the Sydney
Uni. team will raise the struggle to the dignity of an
inter-State contest. Many ’bailers will regret that the
English governing body has wiped the field goal out of
existence. It was like the joker in euchre—it made for
uncertainty. Also, it made for the better show of a light,
fast team against a solid, heavy one. A light team, which
had no chance of breaking through and getting over the
line, could often save a game by feeding a couple of fast
runners who could also kick long shots with precision.
Presumably the local governing body will also amend its
code so as to make the game uniform, but the amendment
will not be an improvement.
Last season the Australian Footballers showed
the wisdom of the serpent in endeavoring to capture the
school boys, and already are reaping the reward in the
upspringing of a whole crop of new clubs. Last season
the Australians were unlucky ; the game that was sup-
posed to be far less risky than Rugby had a couple of acci-
dents that the Rugbyites declared made their hair stand
on end. If the Rugby game is to hold its own, the people
who run it will have to take steps to capture the school
boys, or face a birth-rate problem which will prove fatal.
Saturday sees the start of the “Soccer* foot-
ball competitions. The British Association game is
spreading in N.S.W. A Maoriland team will arrive here
in June, and play its first inter-State match on 17th of
that month. Last season a N.S.W. team visited Maori-
land, and kept its end of' the log up very well indeed.
The “Soccer” people have arranged with the Rugby and
Australian people that their inter-State matches shall not
clash with any big fixtures under either of the other
codes.
» * * «
Another visit to Maoriland of an English Rugby-
team is scheduled for 1907.

The M.L. footballer is associated with the
leather from birth nowadays. A “junior,” elected as a
member of a Christchurch Club lately, was barely a
fortnight old.

Notwithstanding the fact that Yic. Football
League denies it, professionalism exists in nearly all the
Melbourne clubs. The price of a “star” man this season
is a lump sum of from £2O to £SO, and a weekly wage of
£2 and free board. Second-raters living at, say, Ballarat
or Geelong, obtain a guinea a match and liberal travelling
expenses. Good, useful men are only worth a job ; that
is, the club secretary uses his influence to obtain outside
employment for them. The metropolitan touts are all
over the country now searching for “ stars.”

There’s great heart-burning in Sydney public
schools at the proposal of teachers to compel the

accompany Kieran, the swimmer, to England. The com-
mittee of the Amateur Swimming Association (N.S.W.) is
feeling pretty sore just now, and some of its members are
talking loudly about the “ ingratitude of Kieran.” It
would be more just and sensible if they lamented their
own want of tact and commonsense. When Kieran had
wrecked numerous world’s records the eye of J. Bull fell
upon him, and he was invited to call in at the power-
house of the Empire and show off his muscles before the
Boss. The Boss would pay half the exes and treat him as
a guest while he remained at the head-station. Never-
theless money would be required, and it was desirable
that someone should accompany the young man as
manager and trainer. The public put up the money,
and the Amateur Swimming Association took charge of
the proceedings. If it ever asked Kieran whom he would
like to accompany him, it flouted his wishes and, “in the
best interests of the sport,” appointed its own honorary
secretary to the job. The people who put up the money
were ignored, and so was the man for whom the money
was put up. First intimation public had of the appoint-
ment was that some of the subscribers were indignant
that Mr. Mitchell, Kieran’s discoverer and present trainer,
had not been nominated. Then the storm burst. When
Kieran said he would prefer Mr. Mitchell to go with him,
the committee ignored him. When he said he would go
with no one else, it held a meeting and said he must go
with Mr. Hill, and hinted vaguely that if he didn’t he
wouldn’t go at all. Then Mr. Hill resigned, and all ended
satisfactorily, with Mr. Mitchell in charge.

“G. 8.” : A great deal of rubbish has been
written about Annette Kellermann’s performance in swim-
ming XOJ miles in 4 hours 52 minutes, with the aid of the
Yarra’s strong current, and with no contention from
cold and baffling winds and waves. It has been styled
“a record,” and we are told that “Miss Kellermann is
going to Europe to challenge the world’s greatest swim-
mers,” and also to make an attempt “ to swim the English
Channel.” If Miss Kellermann acts wisely she will have a
trial of speed and endurance with Kieran or with some other
local celebrity ere she claims to be either a record-breaker
or a world’s champion. Ten miles is a distance not often
swum, but the record for 5 miles 66yds. in the Thames
was made by Jarvis, in 1903, with the time of lh. 3min.
48 l-ssec. Fred Bounes, in 1894, swam from Blackwall to
Gravesend, a distance of 20J miles, in 4h. 55min.—10
miles further than Annette in 3min. longer, and under
much more difficult conditions. As for swimming the
Channel, when Webb swam from Dover to Calais, it was
supposed that he covered 35 miles, and that the time
occupied was 21h. 45min. Since then, Cavil], sen., is said
also to have swum across, but a dozen other burly men
have failed, and it is certain that Miss Kellermann’s friends
can have no idea of the terrible privations, difficulties and
dangers she would have to encounter en route , or they
would not even hint at such an undertaking.
The bowling-ground success of cricketer H.
Moses is easily explainable. In powers of eye and hand
good bowling needs the same set-up of nerves and prac-
tice that good cricket calls for. Fierce slogging is not
good cricket. Keenness of eye and a precise calculation
of cause and effect govern the difference between sound
Play and luck, and these qualities are equally exercised in
the best performances on cricket field and bowling green.
Remarkable that, of 84 original competitors (in-
cluding many Victorians) who contested individual bowl-
ing supremacy, under auspices of Waverley (Sydney)
Bowling Club, two (Messrs. H. Young and P. Gartrell)
left to fight the final should be representatives of same
body (Chatswood B. C.), which entered five men. Both
were very nervous right through, consequently neither
showed true form. Young, who won, 21 to 17, has been a
bowler 10 years, and was once runner-up for N.S.W.
Championship, and on another occasion finished third in
the competition for that honor. Features of the tourney
were easy defeat (21 to 4) of present Victorian champion
Waxman by N.S.W. man Whittle, also fact that, of all
Victorian “ starters,” there wasn’t one left in after second
day’s play.

The latest outbreak of Australian club-swinger
Tom Burrows is to keep going in London for 4fi hours at a
stretch. He twirled them at the rate of 150 revolutions to
the minute, and covered somewhere in the neighborhood
of half-a-million turns. People who watched him went to
sleep, mesmerised by the whirling clubs. Thomas melted
away visibly the last day of the awful strain.

The Australian Board of Control for inter-
national cricket begins to emerge from its cocoon.
N.S.W. and Victoria have joined, Queensland has asked
to come in, and although S.A. has refused to recog'nise
the movement, there is little doubt that the Crow-eaters
will give in their adhesion shortly. If they are going
to have any decent cricket they will have to.
* * * *
Two players stood out clearly on the N.S.W.
t.de in the recent inter-State cricket match against
Queensland —Mackay, scoring 131 out of the total of 355 ;
and O’Connor, bagging 10 wickets for 79 runs. Both
players are colts of promise ; and, although Mackay has
scored hosts of centuries in club and other cricket, it is
his first three-figure total in inter-State matches. In
Association matches Mackay piled up over 1000 runs this
season.

By covering the deposit of £IOO put up by Stan-
bury for the sculling championship race, George Towns
ended the wrangle which has been drifting along
for a couple of months. In the end, Towns gained his
point (75 per cent, of boat receipts in case of defeat, and
equal share if successful). The match is not likely to
come off for a while yet. Stanbury has been training for
nearly six months and has reduced his fat considerably,
but Towns had treated the challenge as bluff and refused
to train ; hence Towns will certainly delay the date of the
race until he has regained his “form.” And the longer
the delay, the worse for Stanbury.

Some of those hard-faced persons who periodi-
cally career along country roads with their noses almost
touching the front tyres of their bikes fooled the Law
disgracefully lately up Ballarat way. They were about to
hold a road race when the Law stepped up and asked to
see their permission to do so from the local council. The
committee apologised profusely; it had forgotten that
formality, but would rush away and see the mayor at
once. The Law was pacified, and sat down to await
the committee’s return. Presently the competitors
“ mooched off ” unostentatiously to see what had become
of the committee. The Law continued in a state of
patient expectation—and remained so most of that day.
Towards evening a youngster strolled casuallv up arid
informed the boss constable that “it had been a fine race,
and that the scratch man had won by less’n a wheel.”
Then the Law plodded disgustedly home by a side street.

The Cooper-Blakesley fight at the Sydney
National Sporting Club came to a sudden and unsatis-
factory end. Blakesley is a colored man, and, therefore,
out of favor with the crowd that makes the noise ; and
Cooper, who is a fine young bruiser, was favorite from
the jump. He did his best to justify the public choice,
and opened with a savage attack, to which the black man
responded just as energetically, but with slightly less
power. Both threw science to the winds, and slogged
after the manner of the neolithic bruiser, and in a wild
rally the top of Cooper’s head crashed against the black
man’s cheekbone, and split the skin round the eye.
Blood gushed out at such a rate that Blakesley was
practically blinded, and the referee stopped the fight and
awarded the money to the white. Cooper hadn’t won
the fight, although he had made the best showing.
Blakesley only lost through being rammed on the
conning-tower.

Jessop and Lenton put up twelve rounds of
interesting evolutions at Sydney Gaiety on Saturday
night. It was all marching and counter-marching.
Extreme caution marked the operations of both. There
was much whirling of arms, there was splendid foot-work,
and they stamped at each other like poley cows, but the
blows thev struck could have been counted on the
fingers, and the damage they did was not apparent to the
naked eye. It was a right cross in the 12th round which
ended the “fight,” by causing Lenton to fall down,
where he stayed till counted out. Both men must have
been hopelessly exhausted—they had travelled over such
a lot of country.

Mat Mitchie versus Alf. Wells at Queen’s Hall,
Melb., the other night was an interesting demonstration
of the fact that a big, powerful, tough, worrying fighter
with little knowledge of the craft, is a soft snap for the
fighter who is small and gritty, and knows all the mys-
teries. A few months back Wells fought one of the goriest
and gamest battles ever seen in Melbourne against a man
of his own class, but Mitchie had him beaten in round one,
and outed him in round two, after having him on the
boards twice for 9sec. Wells, who is a Dandenong iron-
worker, was close upon two stone heavier than Mitchie,
stood nearly a head taller, and has an arm like an adult
gorilla’s. He went in a glutton, but the small scientist
timed him like a clock, head-work and foct-work nullified
his rushes, and his strength was all against him, since it
only served to bring him, head on, to Mitehie’s punches,
which, having Mat’s power behind them and Alf’s vehem-
ence before them, soon put the big boy to bed-a-by.

A Bethnal Green (Eng.) bruiser has confessed
that he lives by supplying pugilists as “protectors” to
bookmakers, M’s.P. at election times, litigants in divorce
and breach of promise cases, and to young noblemen who
are being black-mailed. Prices vary from ss. to £5,
according to the duration of the job and the severity of
the encounter. The same business is not unknown in
Australia. The great Freetrade party in N.S.W. had
always a ring of ex-pugs, engaged to smother interjec-
tions at Cobdenite meeting's.

“Old Timer”: Recently saw it printed in a
Tasmanian paper that Gipsy Cooper had died in Launces-
ton. There was no comment beyond that he had been an
old-time prize fighter. If the Gipsy Cooper referred to
was identical with the individual of that name who
figured prominently in the palmy days of the English
P.R., he must have been over 100 years of age. Though
never a champion, Cooper got very close to the positio'n.
He was a tough, determined and very gritty pug in the
10st. class, and could always, until he fell from grace,
command heavy backing. Among the best men Cooper
faced were Scroggins, West Country Dick, Alec Read,
Bishop Thorpe and Dutch Sam. After scoring six suc-
cessive wins, Cooper was charged with selling one fight
and was promptly dropped by his friends. Then he
drifted down, and was ultimately transported to Australia
for theft.
Recent Age advt., which hints at the
growth of the abominable “tip” system in Aus-
tralia :
"jt/TAN, elderly, milk two or three cows, grow vege-
tables, flowers, clean boots, knives, scrub veran-
dah, generally useful indoors and outdoors, must be
early riser. Permanent situation with good home for
right man. Wages, 7s. 6d. and tips. Apply,
The “tip” breeds the cadging, forelock-pulling
type of creature who renounces most of his manli-
ness ; and it can’t be jumped on with too heavy a
boot. It is an offence in some States under the
Truck Act to pay a person his wages in anything
but coin ; the law ought to be stretched a bit to
make it illegal to pay him by “ tip.”
The Jap. at home lives mainly on various
vegetables, many kinds of fish, and the soya bean.
In the field, he gets dried fish, the soya bean, and
anything which may be met with. The soya bean,
practically unknown outside of Manchuria and
Japan, yields on analysis from 35 to 40 per cent,
of albumen and 17 per cent, of fat —more than
double the nutriment of beef and mutton.
Not a single sword was to be seen at most
of the Easter encampments, and yet, if you go
where the fat officer men are on show and
swaggering socially, you can’t hear yourself
think for the clank of their cutlery. The sword is
now admitted to be useless as an implement of
war, and the swashing officer retains it only as an
ornament. This being so, why not wear it as a
hatpin ?
Noticed in the Sydney daily papers, the
other day—
Anew commercial sketch map of the N.S. Wales rail-
ways has been issued. It shows at a glance every station
and platform, with the distance against each, also the
complete list of passenger fares, which should be very
useful to the mercantile community generally.
And this map, if you please, is run out as an advt.

“ Valak ” on the Boer war :
B. R. Wise, in his “Impressions in South Africa”
(20/4/’OS), states that the Boer war was due to Mr. Glad-
stone’s untimely lenience. Not so ; it was due to the fact
that the Rand mine-owners found the Boer Republic in
the way of their schemes (the Chinese were calling), and
there happened to be in office a British Government
which, by some occult means, was induced to look
through the mine-owners’ spectacles. Certainly, had Mr.
Gladstone been less a man, and more a Chamberlain,
there would have been no Boer war for obvious reasons ;
even dead Boers do not fight a second time. So if Mr.
Gladstone had not been guilty of being just, Mr. Chamber-
lain would have been unable to perpetrate the late Boer
outrage. No, it is not against Mr. Gladstone that the
slaughtered Boers, murdered children, ruined homes, and
Chinese cry out, and it reflects little credit on Mr. Wise
that he can so cheerfully ignore the obvious and shameful
cause of the war, and try to fasten it on Mr. Gladstone,
and one of the deeds which shine out in British history, and
give one some idea of what British fair play ought to
mean. Carried out to its logical conclusion, Mr. Wise’s policy
means that the right is only to be upheld when it is on
the winning side, since to defend it when losing is only to
encourage it in a hopeless struggle. Truly a noble senti-
ment ! Even if the Boers were encouraged to carry on
the struggle owing to the support of the Liberals and
pro-Boers (and this is only an opinion), does Mr. Wise think
that it would reflect more credit on the Boers to he alive
and living in amity with the Chinese and mine-owners
than to be dead? They perished fighting for liberty,
home, and country, and Englishmen did not at one time
consider that a misfortune. Mr. Wise states they were
sacrificed to ignorance and faction. It seems to me he
chooses his nouns badly ; rather “ greed and lying."

Memory Training .
MEMORY MEANS MONEY.
A poor memory is a hindrance to a man’s success in
life. Whatever your position in life may be you
cannot but benefit by improving: your memory.
Memory is the foundation of all brain work ; thus the
better the memory, the better the brain work. No
matter how good or how bad a memory you may have
you can develop it by proper training-, just as you can
develop strength by proper exercise. Do not let a
poor memory hinder your success in life, but organise
your memory by a Course of
PELMAN’S SYSTEM OF MEMORY TRAINING
which will teach you how to use your brains syste-
matically and turn failure into success. The PELMAN
SYSTEM aims at the Scientific development of the
Natural Memory, and is therefore invaluable to Busi-
ness Men, Students, Lawyers, Doctors, Clergymen,
&c. The Course is simple, easy and interesting, and
may be mastered in six weeks. Takes up very little
time, and results are immediate and permanent.

A fortnightly debauch and intervening
abstinence is preferable to the daily tippling which
never causes complete drunkenness but only
muddlement.— Dr. It. S. Porter.
A London undertaker astonished a com-
mittee of inquiry last year by explaining how easy
it was to get two corpses buried in different ceme-
teries on the strength of only one death certificate.
In an English law court it was recently
stated by a medical expert that one-third of
England’s rural laborers die comparatively early
because their lack of intelligent thought brings
about softening of the brain, through the starva-
tion of the nerves which convey blood to that
organ.
“Nulla”: In the struggle to be “gen-
teel,” it’s wonderful what a woman will put up
with. Know one girl, who worked in a music
shop. Hours, 9 to (5; till 9 on Saturday. Had to
give short lessons on mandoline, violin, and banjo,
play over new music, serve at counter, and in her
spare time rattle out cakewalks on the piano as
an advertisement. Wages, 12s. 6d. per week;
about the earnings of an indifferent newsboy.
“ Misocant ” further pursues a promising
subject:—
I notice, without surprise, that a sympathetic lady
correspondent (Woman's Letter, 20/4/’05) is quite assured
that it is the Tyrant Man who makes woman wear
skirts and keeps her from hygiene and happiness
in trousers. Fudge ! When I hear of Tyrant Man being
able to exercise some control over woman’s financially
disastrous habit (to him) of wearing a five-guinea hat and
a 15-guinea dress that, after half-a-dozen appearances,
“isn’t fit to wear,” I’ll believe that he has a say in the
matter of woman’s dress. But not before. Why should
woman hesitate to own to the truth, that she wears skirts
and not trousers because there‘is more of the seductive-
ness of mystery and less of the disenchantment of the
obvious in skirts? They are the best illustrations of the
logic phrase suppressio veri suggestio falsi, hiding the
plain truth and hinting at the beautiful untruth. Skirts
are the cheese in the man-trap. And woman knows it.
Parts of Far-West N.S.W., which have
had a couple of good seasons, never had rabbits
thicker than at present. One station reported,
from men in charge of tanks, 160,000 of the pest
killed in the first onslaught, with word from three
tanks still to come in ; and on a neighboring
station, at one slaughter place, 80 buckets of
poisoned water were lapped up in one night.
Victoria is nowadays not so much the
cabbage-garden as the cauliflower-garden of
N.S.W. Like the more aesthetic rose and such
flowers, the cauliflower is often attacked by aphis,
and this year infested cauliflowers have been
stopped at the border, and the loss of the whole
export trade to N.S.W. is threatened : that will
cut away from Victoria some thousands of pounds
worth of trade.
The young Marquis of Bute thinks that he
has now got enough to marry upon. He owns
117,000 acres in Wales, practically the town of
Cardiff, the Isle of Bute, six country seats, a
London residence, a large area in Palestine, and a
rental of £250,000 a year. The founder of the
house was the illegitimate son of Robert II of
Scotland, the Welsh estates were acquired by
marriage, and the foreshores of Cardiff, his
wealthiest possession, were granted by the cor-
poration for an annual dinner, now no longer
given.
“ W.L.D.” : Has “ barracker ” been traced
to its origin yet ? Seems closely allied to “ barri-
kin,” an old slang term, easily derived from French
“ baragouin ” (gibberish, cant, nonsense), and
thus, by easy assimilation, applied to the loud
mouthing of to-day’s barracker. But this shouter
is something more ; he is a vehement partisan, and
thus suggests Turkish “barakdir,” a standard-
bearer. Yet again, might not the term be a
coinage from Scripture ? The prophetess Deborah
cries, “Barak, up!” and Barak ups accordingly
and smites Visera after the manner of the bar-
racker smiting the referee.
Tor most women life is a prolonged bazaar.
—Benjamin Swift.
Sydney cabmen stand in their own light
by sticking conservatively to shilling fares (in
practice generally Is. 6d. fares) for a quarter-hour.
If they ran 6d. fares for five minutes, they would
about double their income. Thousands who don’t
Want a quarter-hour would take 6d. worth,
especially in city centres.
S. Aus. Premier Butler is trying to scare
his electors against the Labor Party by holding
up the £6,000,000 4 per cent, bonds which will
begin to pour in 12 months from now. Well, the
Labor Party is pledged not to borrow any more
money for new public works unless they can show
interest and a sinking fund contribution ; and
that’s the best guarantee Bull-Cohen can have
that the money he has loaned will be all right. The
difference between Butler and Price is that Butler
won’t promise not to water down Cohen’s security
any more, while Price absolutely pledges himself
to it. So between the two Cohen should prefer
Price.
“Jimmy S.” : Have just had anew pit-
horse experience. Customary when two wheelers
are drawing from a district to signal to each other,
to prevent the skips fouling. Swing a lamp from
side to side is “ Hold on,” and holding one rigidly
upright means, “Draw the sprags and let her
rock.” A party of shiftmen was fixing up a bit of
bad roof at the turn. One wheeler slewed round
the turn, gave the “ Come on ” signal to the other,
and rattled on with the full set to the flat. You
could hear the other set start, and then stop.
Then the wheeler came down the road. “Which
of you idiots swung a lamp?” he growled.
“I can’t get my horse to start. Then he whistled
and held his lamp up. The trapper boy drew the
sprags, and the horse came at once. Turned out
that, someone had been swinging a lamp while
looking for tools.

In a letter to The Bulletin (20/4/’O5),
Mr. E. Wilson Dobbs wrote : “ Certainly I did
not agree with him (Mr. H. G. Turner) on that
nor on other occasions.” A malevolent comp, (it
was really the comp. !) “improved ” that into “ on
that nor any other occasion.” Which made a
difference.
Mr. E. T. DAVENPORT, Valley Head, Ala,
writes : —“I have used Jayne’s Expectorant in my family

“Honey” as a term of endearment is
attributed in its origin to the American negroes.
As a matter of fact, its use in this sense antedates
the discovery of Columbus. Shakspeare makes
Othello say to Desdemona: “Honey, you shall
be well desired in Cyprus.”
The Tariff Commission has been intro-
ducing foreign politics into its examination of

cheerfulness is best acquired by well regulated

Birthday, Berringa, has dropped its dividend to
6d. This is the first time that so small a sum has been
paid in the long: and successful career of the co. Only
£1350 has been called up, and about £125,000 has been
distributed. The trouble with the co. to-day is that
while there is plenty of quartz at the bottom level,
there is very little gold. The pay shoot, such as
it is, is also pitching fast to the south, so that co. only
has about 280 ft. to go to reach the boundary. Fortu-
nately for Berringa, patches of gold have been picked up
in the Birthday Tunnel and Williams’ Fancy, and as these
two properties are most cheaply managed, capital is being
kept on the field. Some of the late floats, though, don’t
count up to much.

Lord Nelson North, St. Arnaud, beat the Lord
Nelson over the little game played by the latter. Minister
M'Leod got up on stilts over the Lord Nelson not telling
the North that it could not bore from its ground. But he
must be singularly innocent if he really believed that
the North people expected that the other co. would sound
its own death-knell. The amusing part is that the North
scrip is well held by some of the people who were con-
nected with the South German Deep Co., whose claim old
Maldon Gray always contended was jumped from the
South German. Lord Nelson, anyway, ought to have told
the North straight that they would not help them in the
least, and then seen that they worked their ground. If
they had done this they would not have shown up so
poorly.

It is quite easy to grasp why the Long Tunnel
directors declined to publish the amalgam returns of the
co. week by week. The co.’s bank at present is the
rich stone met with near the break south of the Extended
boundary. As the other stone is under lOdwt. grade, a
little good stuff will have to be added if a 15dwt. average
is to be kept up. When the new level is opened up at the
2350 ft., the position will be vastly improved if the shoot
of 3tone pitches south from the Extended. At present,
3ft. of good stone is showing at this level.

The Forbes-Maindample crowd has taken up
with the Marmont at Molesworth (Vic.). W. F. Link is
their manager, and his optimism is as great as ever. Very
little better than a reef channel has been met with in the
Marmont at the 175 ft. level. But disappointment such as
this does not daunt so happy-dispositioned a man as Link.
“ It is not unusual,” he says, “ for reefs in all districts to
pihch out and again make in large and payable bodies of
stone when the lode or reef channel is explored at greater
length.” True ; but, as a rule, when this happens, the
quartz has not petered out in a depth of 175 ft. At the
same time, it might be fair to ask Mr. Link to define a
“ sandstone dyke formation.”
The recent death of Joseph Lock, at Colling-
wood (Vic.), recalls that he was the discoverer of Lock’s
Beef, Sandy Creek, from which he took £40,000 worth of
gold. He lost most of it in the land-boom crash.
* * * *
Mundaring water scheme (W.A.) is being hope-
lessly muddled. After every shower the weir overflows,
and Government is at its wits’ ends to know what to do
with the water, but won’t reduce the price. Three mines
at Southern Cross—Hope’s Hill (40 stamps), Greenmount
(20 stamps), and Haddon (10 stamps)—have closed down,
declaring the price of water prohibitive. At Coolgardie,
Bayley’s (20 stamps), Tindall’s (10 stamps), and Empress
of Coolgardie (10 stamps) have also thrown up the
sponge for an alleged similar reason. At Kal-
goorlie there are many complaints, and Hannan’s
Beward (10 stamps) and North Kalgurli (10 stamps) both
use salt water. Even the big mines only use half the
water they would were it sold at a lower price. Small
consumers are charged 10s. per 1000 ; big consumers ss.
A lot has been talked on the subject by Federal members
during their visit, and possibly something may come of
the wordy warfare. No doubt the Government is in a
quandary. The scheme is a great frost from the point of
view of paying its way and providing the statutory
sinking fund. The Government wants more revenue, and
it needs an assurance, before it lowers the price, that
that won’t simply mean lowering the revenue, instead of
increasing it.
* * • •
Princess Royal Central, Norseman (W.A.), is
driving south at 950 ft., to try and pick up the pay shoot,
which it is expected to cut 100 to 150 ft. south. Lode is
Bft. wide, of solid quartz, and very low grade and unpay-
able at present. A month or six weeks should prove
whether shoot continues from Princess Boyal or not.
Manager Henderson, since taking charge some 15
months ago, has opened eyes of Adelaide dawdlers as
to what can be done by an energetic man.

Bellevue, Mt. Sir Samuel (W.A.), seems to be
far from the great mine Algernon Moreing has never tired of
telling shareholders it is. March return shows a miserable
average of 4‘2dwt., and month’s working shows loss of
£2OOO, or 10s. lOd. per ton treated. Development reports
are poor, and prospects far from rosy. Much money has
been spent on new equipment, buildings, &c. ; and,
although co. reconstructed and started two years ago
with £70,000 working capital, most of it has been spent.
One little “inside” group at time of reconstruction held
230,000 out of the 400,000 shares. It would be interesting
to know how many they hold now.
* * * *
Associated, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), has had the
predicted accident With electric winding engine. This
engine derives its motive power from the mill engine, and
its brake power from the air compressor. If either of
these stops, driver is helpless. While a platman was
going from 600 ft. to 1000 ft., brake failed to act, as there
was no air, and he went to 1000 ft. at railway speed, but
escaped with his life for a wonder. What are inspectors
doing to allow such conditions ?
» * * *
Westralia Mt. Morgans is still working at a loss
of somewhere about 255. a ton. Latest return pans out
at only 4'9dwt. per ton. It is expected, however, that
shortly the mine will be on a better basis. Systematic
sampling is being done, as on all other big mines, as
values in W.A. are so erratic that nothing short of con-
stant sampling is reliable. A 900-h.p. engine has been
installed, and mine is now equipped with the biggest mill
engine and heaviest stamps on the fields. There is an
enormous lode on property, but values are irregular.
Brown Hill Extended, Kalgoorlie, may yet
become payable. Of three parcels recently treated, it
turns out that 224 tons, which averaged 15dwt., came
from the drive on the new lode at 700 ft. This ore was
broken in driving 200 ft. on a lode 3ft. wide. Management
has recommended sinking a new shaft, as this lode is
800 ft. east of main shaft. Work will entail a big expense,
but can easily be done within a year, judging from experi-
ence of Boulder’s Hamilton shaft.

Queen Cross, Charters Towers (Q.), for the fort-
night crushed 952 tons for 13350 z. Besidues and concen-
trates, £1648. Wages men are employed running the
Stulls, so as to keep up tonnage ; while interested people
are in England explaining what a fine property is the
Cross. Bull talks of sending an expert out to inspect, and
complains that there never was any difficulty in buying
shares at 655. Other day a rise holed through to Victoria
and Queen’s underhand stope unexpectedly ; market was
shocked—a hundred feet or so less backs than was guessed
at. They go more by guess at the Towers than on any
other big mining field of Australia.

With John Moffatt’s name to back it, Mt.
Molloy (N.Q.) has been turned over from a syndicate to a
30. in 100,000 £1 shares, 60,000 going to the promoters,
20,000 to the public (who applied for nearly three times as
many), and 20,000 reserved. Show, which is in from Pt.
Douglas, was discovered 20 years ago, and called after
Paddy Molloy, who (or his mate) unearthed it while after
cattle. After a few thousands had been taken out of it,
a Melb. co. got it, put down some shafts which succeeded
in dodging the ore, and threw it up. Then James For-
sythe, an old Northerner, got it, passed it on to Tenter-
field Beid, who passed it on to John Moffatt, the biggest
and one of the cleanest mining men in the North. He
paid £l5OO for it, £lOOO of the money out of profits. A
quantity of work, more or less pig-rooting:, has been done ;
shafts are on the underlay ; a cupola furnace has been
put up away from the mine (cartage between the two, 3s.
a ton; ; and iron flux is scarce in the rough district, and
dear. Very low-grade matte is turned out; but there is
talk of two reverbs. Ore bodies are irregular ;as usual,
rich at surface ; and have been touched at about 180 ft.
Nothing in the way of reliable estimates can be made on
present development, and mine should have been opened
up further before a £lOO,OOO co. was formed. There are
certainly a few thousand tons in sight worth from 7 to 15
percent., with slugs going much higher ; but the exces-
sive costs must be considered in connection with these
percentages. The mine may be big ; but its bigness is, so
far, speculation.
* * * *
Shockingly overloaded Chillagoe (N.Q.)—and
others seem to be going the same way, thanks to the
nearly always deceptive surface prospects of copper
shows—gets a lift from debenture-holders, whose name is
mostly J. Bull. Debenture debt is £500,000 at 6 per cent.;
J.B. agrees to take 5 p.c., and for three years this is to be
payable only out of profits. Also £47,000 of overdue
interest can stand over. But it wouldn’t be wise for
shareholders to shout to any great extent over the con-
cessions. Last year’s working account showed a profit of
£10,249, and that was the best so far ; so the co. has a
long way to go before £10,249 becomes £25,000, and it’s
only at that point that shareholders will begin to have a
look in. Moreover, at that point there will be the heavy
maintenance of the railway to reckon with. All the con-
cessions give them is a hold on the mine for three years,
and a chance in anything that turns up in that time.

Queensland Government has decided to proceed
with a railway to connect Cloncurry with Richmond.
Stated that the work will begin in August, and the
Government is encouraged to go ahead with the first sec-
tion because it will open up pastoral country. By that
time some conclusion will have been arrived at from the
small but earnest efforts of the G. O. Wilcocks syndicate-
cwm-Government to explore the sulphide bodies of Olon-
curry. Cloncurry miners recently met and denounced
these exploration efforts as inadequate. If the two or
three shafts now being put down unearth good sulphide
bodies, no doubt they will have another meeting, and
hold up the fact as ample justification for the construc-
tion of the line. The rich carbonates that are again
coming out at Cloncurry keep the field in good repute,
and of all those that are clamoring for a line to the coast
this district promises, on paper, by far the best return.

A tin lode has been re-discovered at Stockyard
Creek, near Charters Towers. Fifteen tons treated over
the Wilfley tables gave 4£ tons tin ore, assaying 70 per
cent, metallic tin. Price of the metal makes tin shows
popular.

Kulamadau, Woodlark Island, crushed 450 tons
for 2840 z. A 3d. dividend has been declared. What’s
wrong—buyers only lid. ? Manager reports : “ The dam
burst, and a flood of silt and water went down into the
mine. I have plenty of ore to go on with. There are 40ft.
of backs left.”

So it has at last been announced that the Briseis
(Tas.) has an option over that Bull failure on the other
side of the river from the Briseis—the North Ringarooma.
Clausten, who managed the concern, has gone up Queens-
land way, presumably to control a tin dredging show for
Gibbs, Bright and Co. The North Ringarooma was tied
with a pumping plant, but the overburden was higher
and more troublesome than the Briseis Hill capping.
With the latter out of the way, the Briseis Co. will have
plenty of water to spare, and so it could attack the over-
burden leisurely. In that way it might make the mine
pay, though the fact that the tin will have to be elevated
owing to the dip of the lead under the level of the
Ringarooma will add to costs.
* * * *
Tin Smelting and Refining Co. scratched J.
Bull harder than any other recent Anglo- Australian con-
cern. When it was announced two years ago. that
arrangements had been made guaranteeing a good supply
of ore, £1 preference shares went to £1 15s. In London,
even before the works closed down the other day, they
stood at 9d. Some directors are now involved in a lawsuit
arising out of alleged misrepresentation.

Sometimes the truth concerning Chinese labor
bubbles up, even when a mineowner in Australia is talk-
ing. Mr. John M’Donald, whose mission to Australia in
the interests of Bull kept him in the Northern Territory
for six months reorganising the poor affairs of the Nor-
thern Territory Mining and Smelting Co., informed the
N.Q. press that it would pay his co. better to employ
white miners at 11s. Bd. per day than Chinamen at 7s.
This on the score of work alone. How much it is worth
to keep Ah Sin out of a gold mine on the other score only
the bland gentleman can tell; and he doesn’t.

The illuminating efficiency of the best oil-burn-
ing (usually colza or half colza and half kerosene) safety-
lamps yet invented, is much below a candle-power. Of
course, so far as illumination is concerned, the electric
light is best, but has the objection that it gives the
miner no warning against gas. A Newcastle (N.S.W.)
watchmaker recently patented an automatic acetylene
gas safety-lamp. Gas is generated by a valve dripping
water on to calcium carbide, and the dripping of the
valve is regulated by the pressure of the gas. The
illuminating efficiency is 6J-candle-power, and the lamp
has stood critical tests at several gassy mines in the
Newcastle district under actual working conditions. The
illuminating cost is about the same as that of the oil-
lamp—under Id. per day.

J. Bull is having his usual anxious time with
the Northern Territory mines. The Northern Territory
Mining and Smelting Co. kicks off with a new manager
(Dyson, of Cobar) and new capital, and hopes to get some
money out of the erratic Iron Blow gold show, and the
Great Ellison copper mine, each of which might have
been better developed before erection of the blast furnace
and two reverbs. Last manager is reported to have
stated that the blast furnace was turning out more matte
than the two reverbs, could deal with, but the London
board sent a man to inspect the excessive production,
and his report wasn’t so cheerful. All circumstances
considered, it is surprising that Bull put up additional
capital at the present time, for the mining areas of the
Territory are, generally speaking, not more promising
to-day than they were reported to be 20 years ago. The
copper shows are, and will probably continue to be, the
best risks; no respectable tin lode has been developed,
and the gold reefs are small, and so far have been proved
to have no existence in depth.
AT POVERTY POINT.
An American critic said of someone who acted Lear,
that he played the King as if he continually expected
someone else to play the ace.
The Nellie Stewart co. doubles back in M.L., consequent
on Sydney Lyceum sale and the upsetting of Musgrove’s
plans.
Miss Jessie Maynard, who came to Australia a few years
ago with “Nurse” and other comedies, is again in Mel-
bourne. The awful Cold Country climate drove her back
to Australia’s suns.
“ F.” : It is a treasonable utterance —but I must say that
the late Joe Jefferson’s performance of Rip Van Winkle was
a rather wearisome thing when I saw it in London a while
after the actor had visited Australia. Too much elabo-
rated in the later scenes, tediously prolonged, wire-
drawn. Jefferson at that time, perhaps, had been
spoiled by excessive laudation of the petty details in his
acting. He assumed that everything he did (as Rip) was
enthrallingly interesting, though some of the business
was simply tiresome. When I saw J. C. Williamson play
the part in Melbourne a few years later I thought his
perfomanee had nearly all the virtues of the “original
creation,” and none of its vanities.
Barney Bernard, who was a small comic object in con-
junction with Kolb and Dill here, is saying bitter things
about Australia, wherever opportunity offers, since his
return to America. 8.8.’s complaint against the Common-
wealth arises from “ the Australian’s lamentable lack of
humor.” In ’Frisco he has been working a turn based on
our antipodean inability to see a joke that is not as large
and familiar as a church. Bernard is an ungrateful
Hebrew. He was quite a popular item in the shows
staged by the Yank Travesty Stars, although it is true
that Australia had grown tired of laughing at many of his
jokes some considerable time before his arrival. It is the
old worry. The Travesty Stars, although they had a
good harvest in Sydney, did not get away with a bundle
of Australian money. It is an American axiom that
money talks, but it is the lack of it that makes for
loquacity in the average pro.
“ H.”: Jefferson, in his autobiography, wrote fully
about Sydney. He left America partly for his health
and partly to recover from the depression caused by the
death of his wife. He was a trifle surprised that not the
faintest whiff of his reputation had reached the all-potent
manager Tolano. He was much impressed by the merits
of the Sydney actors, Rogers and others. With genuine
modesty, he felt rather nervous in standing beside them.
However, Rip Van Winkle and “ Our American Cousin"
hit hard. The inimitable versatile Rogers took Dundreary.
Tolano became as obsequious to Jefferson as Buckstone
was to Sothern. Coming to Melbourne, Jefferson was in
the worthy hands of Jimmy Simmonds. at the Princess’s.
“ Rip Van Winkle ” took at once, and was presented with
Jefferson also in the burlesque of “ Mazeppa,” withdrawn
after a night or two. Simmonds kept on engaging leading
performers in a manner which looked reckless to the
Ooppin school, with such a small theatre, too. Stewart
was a very remarkable Dundreary in “ Our American
Cousin.” “The Octoroon” evoked a culmination of
talented performers. The cast included Jefferson,
Stewart (Uncle Pete, an amazing contrast to Dundreary),
Clarence Holt, Lambert, Heir, Fitzgerald, Dunn, Ireland,
Mrs. Heir, Rosa Dunn, Mrs. Phillips, and Dolly Green.
Jefferson’s successes included “The Cricket on the
Hearth,” “ Heir at Law,” and “ Poor Gentleman.” After
the season, Jefferson took a spell. He opened Coppin’s
new Haymarket Theatre with “ Our American Cousin.”
Jefferson was never more nervous than when he acted
“ The Ticket-of-Leave Man ” in Hobart, where it was
received with the utmost favor. His Melbourne Princess’
season had included just three nights with Barry Sullivan,
in “The School for Scandal,” “ Much Ado About Nothing,”
and “ Money.” He acted a brief season under Sullivan’s
management at the Royal.
A daughter of the old-time sterling comedian, G. H.
Rogers, passed over last week at Melbourne—Mrs. Fanny
Julia Patterson. She was the widow of J. A. Patterson,
an actor of some note 15 years ago.
“ Z.” : Once I lived in Tallangatta, in the Mitta Valley.
Theatrical companies used to come thither—strange com-
panies who played “ East Lynne,” “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’
and a host of pirated plays, which bore any titles except
those their authors gave them. Sometimes they came by
rail, sometimes by road. One company constantly came
and went in a van. I remember its “ last appearance.”
One misty morning the company boarded the van and
drove away up the Mitta Valle}'. The valley leads to no-
where, except the mountains, and whither the company
was going no man knew. Toward Omeo there was only a
bridle path, along which no van could pass. For months
we watched for that company to return, but not a hares-
foot of it ever re-appeared. Some day prospectors will
drop across them—either a host of bleached skeletons or
a settlement of pros, on some sheltered plateau. It is 16
years since then—there may be by now, in the mountains
north-east, the finest juvenile company in Victoria.
Evan Roberts, the Welsh revivalist, recently told, in
writing, his credulous followers that he had directly
received a Divine command that he was to remain
absolutely silent for seven days. The late Antoinette
Sterling once announced in Sydney that she would hence-
forth refrain, by Divine command, from taking the
swelling top note in the Lost Chord. The “command”
appears to have reached her sensorium by way of her vocal
chords which absolutely refused to sound the note.
Doubtless, too, Roberts was hoarse.
Roxy Barton, formerly leading lady of the Willoughby
and Geach Company, is now playing medium parts with
F. R. Benson’s Shakspeare Repertoire Company in Eng-
land. Benson’s Company interlards Shakspeare with “ the
School for Scandal,” “She Stoops to Conquer,’’and one or
two of the old Greek plays. It is the very best mumming
school in Britain, and the aspirant who works in there is
very lucky, for the jealousies of the “star” system are
excluded, and the “hero” of to-day changes places with
the walking gentleman to-morrow. Oscar Asche, who has
established high-water mark in the way of Australian
mummers’ progress, got his schooling with Benson, and
Cyril Keightly is now with the organisation.
Mr. Hugh Ward, formerly of Williamson’s, now very
near the head of the pantomime world in England,
manages to gather round him quite a lot of Australians at
times, and gives Sunday afternoon “at homes ” to help
things along. At one of these, a few weeks back, appeared
the newly-arrived Cuvier Hastings (now on the look-out
for London appearances), George Giddens, Maude Chet-
wynd and her new husband, and quite a number of other
favorites. Kate Rooney, of Sydney, Thorold Waters, of
Melb., and Ward’s own “Australian Ladies’Quartette ”
helped in the programme.
Bigger risks than most people conceive are taken by
English mummers and musicians when they tour Aus-
tralia. The London market is so crowded with aspirants
that an absence of even a few weeks sometimes gives an
eagerly-seized advantage to some gradually-mounting
rival. Even such a popular favorite as Ada Crossley got
back to London from her Australian and S’African tour to
discover that two new contraltos, Muriel Foster (the
handsomest woman on the English concert platform) and
Kirkby Lunn, had jumped a lot of her work, and, although
she has re-established herself, it involved much solid work
to do so.
“T.D.”: I spend much time in London watching the
factory girls and street slatterns dancing in mid-street to
the strains of barrel-organs. Most of them have a
wonderful dexterity, especially in dancing of the cake-
walk kind, and the precision of youngsters of five or six
years is quite remarkable. From these ranks the ballets
are generally recruited, but beyond that stage the girls
never seem to climb, as they always remain mere copyists.
Many of them get across to Paris, where the ballets are
composed almost entirely of London girls. But where
individuality is required, the continental girl scores, and
all the premiere danseuses of both London and Paris are
French, Austrian or Russian.
Maude Thornton as Griolet, the drummer boy, in recent
revival at Melbourne of “Tambour Major,”gave an imita-
tion of Nellie Stewart, remarkable in its way. It was in
this part that Nellie Stewart so fascinated the officers of
a visiting Russian warship that they took the dress circle
box for the season and nightly attended to load the
beauteous drummer with flowers.
“ Petramos ”: Have met a fair number of Australian
theatrical advance agents, and know most of them by
repute, but haven’t discovered one with an atom of
journalistic instinct in him. Not one that I know can
write a decent advance paragraph for a newspaper, and
some can’t even spell. Their advance pars are all so
sticky with puff that they stand absolutely no chance of
getting into print. An ideal advance agent, in my opinion,
is a man who understands the art of booming his snow in
a slick and quick manner—a fellow who can write an ode
to, say, Tittell Brune’s big toe, and get an editor to pub-
lish it. Another fault with advance agents is that they
always want to shout when the editor hasn’t time even to
think about beer. [Petramos evidently never met R. S.
Smythe—to give one instance.]

EASTER VISITORS
TO
SYDNEY
If you are ill, call on us. Our Specialists will give you Good Advice Free.
We have FOUR LEGALLY-QUALIFIED DOCTORS to advise you. We are
Exports in the Treatment of MEN’S SERIOUS DISORDERS. We do not
experiment. We cure to stay cured, where others fail.
Visitors to Sydney for the Easter holidays will have an opportunity whilst in town of calling at our Institute and consulting
the various members of its Medical and Surgical Staff entirely Free, for we make no charge for any friendly chats upon Medical
matters which may be productive of ultimate good.
At this ttime of the year thousands of people gravitate to the Metropolis on pleasure bent. If any visitor is afflicted with any
Specific Disesase resulting from csertain causes, and fails to obtain the necessary treatment in the remote country parts from which
he comes, he should not neglect the opportunity of receiving these Free consultations, whilst they are offered to him. Opportunity
is not a gift foi; fools. To-morrow, when you are far away in your country home, you may not have the chance of consulting us.
FOUR LEGALLY QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS may be consulted at the one time. Operations will
be arranged, if necessary; also private appointments. The Physician-in-Chief, Db. Wallace, will be in attendance at the
Institute each, morning during tine Easter holidays from 10 to 1 a.m. and 7to 9 p.m. Patients specially recommended by any one
who has received treatment at the Institute are requested to state the direct sources of such recommendations.
FACTS THAT DEFY
ARGUMENT,
We are treating thousands of cases annually,
and is it not reasonable to suppose that we
understand such cases better than those who
are treating only a few hundred? Practice
makes perfect in any line, and it is none the
less true in the treatment of disease. You get
the benefit of Experience when you place your
case in our hands. Do not despair. Order
your treatment at once, and let us add your
name to our long list of cures.
If the slightest doubt exists in your mind
that our treatment will not cure you, it is a
duty you owe to yourself to write to some of
the references we publish, and send an ad-
dressed envelope for reply. We court the
closest investigation. Our Parcel Post System
is a blessing to all sick men living in centres far
from medical men and aid. Thousands of men
would now be in their graves had we not reached
and treated them by our Parcel Post System.
Mr. JAMES C. STERLING, of Do-
vonport, N.Z., who suffered from
INSOMNIA, after three months’
treatment, writes:—
“ I despaired of ever obtaining relief from
your methods, I had tried so many sources
unsuccessfully. lam glad to say, however,
that I am better now than I have been for
years. I now sleep splendidly, and am fast
regaining my health in consequence.”
DEAD MEN TEEL NO TALES. —lt has been said that dead men tell no tales. This may be perfectly true in many
instances, but in thousands of cases it may be regarded as a popular error. Thousands of men who have died from premature
decay, early deaths caused by insidious diseases which have been neglected in their incipiency, although dead and in their graves
tell the history of disease and blighted life. A man whose constitution and health is threatened with ruin by the presence of a
Vital Disorder runs the risk of early doath unless he is competently and skilfully treated by a Specialist who thoroughly under-
stands the causation and phenomena of the said ailment. There are thousands of men in Australia to-day who are living monu-
ments to the expert and timely skill afforded them by the Specialists of
$ Freeman & Wallace Medical Institute
whose Staff of Experts have been consulted in time.
We have cured so many thousands of cases of Varicocele, Rupture, Prostatic Diseases and other ailments associated with
the Nerve and Blood Systems that if tlipre is a cure for your disease you will find it at our Institute. With proper obedience to our
Medical instructions and by faithfully following our methods there is no such thing as failure to our treatment, and if there is a cure
for your disease you will find it at our hands.
We will explain how and why we can cure you and why DISEASES OF MEN require the skill of the Specialist. Natural aptitude claims a
man to certain pursuits. You seldom find one man a good Carpenter, Baker, Shoemaker, or Grocer and his own Physician, but you do find men
who, by applying themselves tfo certain trades and professions become perfect.
The Public recognise quickly the greatest good for the greatest number, especially where Medical study is applied to the ills of humanity.
In treating the AILMENTS OF MEN there is a vast field for human study, and it is impossible for one man to generalise the disease with suffi-
cient effectiveness to be successful. KANE, the gneat American Specialist, says “There is no branch of Science which demands such special
knowledge of any class of diseases wlfich require sueji special treatment as Pelvic Diseases or Complaints effecting the Nerve and Blood Systems.
In these Diseases the Specialists of THE FREEMAN AND WALLACE INSTITUTE excel because they are continuously treating individual
cases. They do not profess to treat all diseases, but/they cure all they treat. By reason of the great cures effected by them they are recognised
throughout Australia. They make a point, in the interests of the public good, of giving to any individual FREE ADVICE, if required. They advertise
because by this means they perpetuate a principle of'the greatest good for the greatest number. They assert their privileges as men and Citizens to
tell the world what their success has be»en.
The Physieian-in-Chief, DR. RICHARD WALLACE, M.D., is a
Specialist of International renown, and much of his experience has
been gained with the British Army. He is registered by Australian,
English, and American Medical Boards, which prove bis credentials
and ability. He may be consulted for the price of one letter or post
card only, which will be replied to, punctually. Applicants will,
however, please mention the Sydney Bulletin, and cut out this advt.
when applying. His 600-page Medical Work, “ OLINICAJjj EXPERI-
ENCES,” profusely illustrated, will be posted free to any address in
Australasia. “ A genuine Medical work.— Sunday Times, Rerth.

Japan’s treatment of its war prisoners is a
thing that can at present only be heard of from
Japanese sources. It is therefore instructive to
find a Kobe paper of March 2nd recording, in a
matter-of-course way, that two Russian officers
(who couldn’t have been under parole, or they
wouldn’t have been there at all) have been tried
for attempting to escape and, very naturally,
resisting the police who arrested them. Ihey
were at once sent to the Penitentiary, where they
will serve their sentence ; the term of it is not
made public.”
Lord Chelmsford, who died the other day,
was perhaps the unluckiest British general in the
history of S’African warfare. The son of a great
lawyer, Chelmsford, in 1879, had proved himself
ft master of German military tactics on paper.
Sent out to S’Africa with a small army to crush
the Zulus, he did, at first, as any other imported
British or German stiff-necked, red-taped, gilt-
buttoned commander would have done. He
walked into a trap, and got out of it with diffi-
culty, losing a portion of his force and the whole
of his reputation. The Boers, wise in the tactics
of the valorous savages, looked on and laughed at
Chelmsford’s mistakes, as they laughed at
General Colley two years later, and at other
generals twenty years after Colley. The
world laughed. Chelmsford at the time looked
an utterly incapable person, whereas he was
the unfortunate result of a European high-
class military education. The difference between
him and subsequent generals from England was
that he didn’t repeat his mistake. Before Sir
Garnet Wolseley was able to reach the ‘ ‘ front ”
and take the command out of his hands, Chelms-
ford ended the war by slaughtering a thousand or
two of the {Zulus and capturing Cetewayo, their
fat and fiery Icing. Then he returned to England
with a little of the “ disgrace ” rubbed off him, and
was heard of no more. Viewed in the light of
subsequent British military proceedings in
S’Africa, the teachableness of Chelmsford seems
quite remarkable. He profited by his experience.
Wolseley, next year, got great credit for managing
a little native war in the same way that Chelmsford
had contrived to crush Cetewayo. Chelmsford’s
brief campaign taught his successor what to avoid
and what to do with the blackfellows who knew
the country. Had Wolseley been first in the field,
Chelmsford would have been sent to supersede
him , perhaps, in which case he probably would
have arrived before the other man had made
amends for his early stupidity.

NEW BOOK ON CONSUMPTION.
Price Qcl., Poet Free.
From Coombe Lodge, Peckham, London, S.E., England
“ H.S.R.” writes :
I see B. R. Wise (B. 20/4 ’O5), giving his impressions of
S’Africa, uses the old wheeze of the misplaced mag-
nanimity of Gladstone in 1881 after Ma.juba being the
cause of the late Boer war. He appears to entirely ig'nore
the rascally Jamieson Raid, and conveniently forgets that
up to then the Boers were practically unarmed, and that
the animosity between the races had almost died out. He
also seems to take it for granted that the British could
easily have wiped the Boers out in 1881, when there were
hardly any railways, and to have forgotten that only for
the railways the Boers would have won in the late war.
Paul Kruger always regretted that it was not a fight to a
finish in 18S1, as he knew that the peace patched up then
was deceitful and onlv made because it was expedient.
But how could B. li. Wise form just opinions running
over a few miles of S’African railways and hobnobbing
with the Jingoes in the clubs ?
“Dico” on the pleasures of a teacher’s
life in Vic. :
Discussing bank clerks’ salaries Age declares £3 a week
to be a “miserable pittance.” That’s all right. But
Wasn’t it the same Age that, about the time of the rail-
way trouble, used to fill its columns with references to
the “fat salaries” of the “pampered civil servants?”
Many hundreds of these civil servants are sixth and
seventh class bush-teachers, whose salaries are nearer £2
than £3. They live in the remotest parts of the State,
lucky indeed if within 10 miles of a railway station. If
married, their home is a two or three-roomed shanty. If
a teacher is moved from one end of the State to the other,
he pays every penny of freight on furniture, and all travel-
ling expenses for himself and family—and he is liable to
be ordered any day from Mildura to Croajingolong!
What would that shift leave *f three months’ salary ?
Thus “ G.H.” :
Article on “Religious Revivalism” (13/4/’O5) went to
the core of the question. Revivalists, whether clad in
the flaming chest-wrap of Booth or otherwise, are a public
calamity. They work upon the weak-minded section of
the community ; and that section shouts Hallelujah, and
pounds the drum or the harmonium, and neglects its
business, and acts the fool generally. All these Booths
and Torreys and Geils and Alexanders trade upon the
emotional excitability so characteristic of religious
people. And the weaker the individual, in physical as
well as in mental fibre, the more subject he is to these
gusts of unreasonable emotion. I reported many of the
revivalist meetings held in Australia by the raucous
Torrey a year or two hack, and was struck with the
uniform feebleness of nine-tenths of the enthusiasts. The
weak-chinned, fishy-eyed portion of the audiences shouted
“Ah-men!” “Praiserlord!” etc., but the stronger types
surveyed the “show” either with amusement or
indifference. The dread of death, and the fear of
the hereafter, only trouble the weakling. The evan-
gelist, who prays and prays over them, has his
tongue in his cheek generally. Talmage and Co.
can always live in a princely fashion by exploiting the
vague fears of these putty-faced people. Look at Dowie s
disciples—consider the converts that Voliva is steadily
exporting to Zion. One would have to boil down a
dozen of them in order to make one vigorous, straight-
backed man.

Gratitude and Appreciation of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
It proved a most effective remedy for a
severe attack of Bronchitis.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I lately had a severe
attack of Bronchitis, and, acting on the advice of a friend,
obtained a supply of your Bronchitis Cure. lam pleased
to inform you it has proved a most effective remedy,
causing me to feel grateful to you for furnishing such a
valuable medicine to the public. Hay you meet with the
success you so well deserve. I place this communica-

" ASTHMA.
▲ Five Years case.
At times very bad indeed.
Quickly and completely Cured by Blame’s
Bronchitis and Asthma Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —For five or six years I was
troubled with asthma, at times very bad indeed. 1 was
very ill just after Christmas, so sent to the local chemist
for a bottle of your Bronchitis and Asthma Cure. I took
the first dose on going to bed, and was not troubled that
night. I finished the medicine, and have not had a
touch of the asthma since, I tell everyone about it.

HAY ASTHMA,
A Severe Attack Believed in Ten Minutes
by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
The Effect was Wonderful.
Mr. W. G. Hearne Dear Sir,—About three weeks ago
While in the vicinity of musty chaff, I gradually felt
a difficulty to breathe. My nose began to run, and to all
appearances I was developing a severe attack of Bron-
chitis or Asthma. At last I could stand it no longer. I
then tried your Bronchitis Cure, and its effect was
wonderful. In less than ten minutes I was all right
again. Such a result, and so quick, astounded me.
This is no exaggeration, I am pleased to say.—Yours
truly, S. H. MAYO, Meredith, Victoria.
BRONCHITIS and ASTHMA.
A Sydney Resident Suffered for Over Sixty
Years.
So Bad He Dared Not Stir.
Relieved in a Few Minutes by Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
Would Give £5O for the Same Benefit rather
than Suffer.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Friend,—Chronic Bronchitis I had from birth, and
I am now 66 years old. Some time back I contracted
Asthma, and for months I was so bad that any remedy
that had previously relieved smothering was of no use to
me. I was so bad that I dared not stir, and spent the
worst night I ever had. When, in a conversation, Mr.
Marsh, J.P., of Balmain, Sydney, kindly told me that a
friend of his was using your Bronchitis Cure, and that it
was good. So my sister bought me a bottle of it, and in
a few minutes after taking the first dose I could breathe a
little. The next day I was better, and kept getting better
every day. To-day lam better than I have been for the
last seven years. I took the medicine as directed, six
bottles, and it cost me less than £l. I would give £5O for
the same benefit rather than suffer as I did. Please make
what use of this letter you think fit. If by so doing it
would only cause one to get rid of this fearful complaint.
—Yours faithfully,
WILLIAM CANHAM,

HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Its Efficacy in chest complaints testified to
by a Grateful Victorian.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in
adding my testimony in praise of your invaluable Bron-
chitis Cure. I have used it for the last three or four years,
and its efficacy I have fully proved in common colds,
severe colds, croupy coughs, and other similar chest com-
plaints. I have given it to infants a few weeks old, young
children and adults of all ages, and have never known it
to fail in relieving at once, and rapidly effecting a cure
with a few doses. I have recommended it to many of my
friends, and they have fully proved its wonderful curative
properties. I feel very grateful to you for a chest medi-
cine so valuable, and cheap enough to be available to any-
one. Trusting its present popularity and sales wiU be
doubled, I am, yours very gratefully,

BRONCHITIS-
An English Lady so ill that th« Doctor
held out no hope.
Was given Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and it
effected a complete recovery.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir. —Not long- since I had occasion
to visit the old country, and before leaving Melburne pur-
chased a bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, which I took
with me. When I arrived in Leeds I found that my niece,
Miss C. Matthews, was suffering from a very severe attack
of Bronchitis, in fact, she was so bad that the family doctor
held out no hope of her recovery. She was then given
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure according to the direction on
the label, and I am very pleased to say that it effected a
complete cure. " R. J. MATTHEWS,

ASTHMA.
A Sufferer 73 Years of Age cured by Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cur*.
Sir, —I am thankful to say that the medicine you sent
for asthma has had a wonderful effect. I have not taken
all the Bronchitis Cure, as I did not need it ; therefore
I send you my hearty good wishes for your future success.
I myself will, for the benefit of others, make it known to
all I know. lam 7 3 years of age—Yours truly,

BRONCHO-PNEUMONIA.
Two Severe Cases cured by One Bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—Kindly forward without
delay another small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. The
bottle I had from you has cured two of my children, but I
do not feel safe without it in the house. I have also re-
commended it to my friends. I lost a fine little girl, three
years of age, from influenza and Broncho-Pneumonia. I
really believe if I had had your medicine my child would
not have died, for the other two, a boy five years old, and
a babj' 8 months old, were suffering exactly in the same
way, and it acted like magic on them ; in fact, a small
bottlefn' both of them ; so trusting you will forward
dela y—l am, yours most gratefully,

A Queensland Sufferer from Bronchitis.
Seventy-two years of age, weak and
Wasted.
The Doctor considered it a hopeless case.
Cured by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l beg: leave to draw your
attention to a remarkable Cure of Bronchitis, which disease
attacked me last May. It was looked upon by the doctor
as a hopeless case. In such an extremity I naturally
looked about for something- to try. I thought it a hard
thing, after 72 years’ experience of the ups and downs of
this life, to die in such an inglorious manner ; besides, I
was very poor in flesh, and thin, and this stimulated me
to make an effort for recovery, if only to improve my con-
dition. I saw your Bronchitis Cure advertised', and
thought I would give it a trial, so I sent to W. H. Harris,
chemist, Gill-street, Charters Towers, and got a small
bottle of it. I had scarcely finished it when I gave up all
thought of leaving my wife a widow, and hopefully looked
forwarded to many more delightful days of up and downs,
principally downs. The second small bottle caused the
Bronchitis and me to part company, greatly to its regret,
I opine. The third bottle stood me on my legs to receive
the congratulations of my friends.
I have been a resident of Charters Towers for 30 years,
and, being gifted with the spirit of good fellowship! have
not the least objection to you making any use of this
testimonial you think proper, as a means of relieving
others similarly situated to myself.
JOHN SHEPHERD,
Queenton, Charters Towers, Queensland.
Relieved by one dose of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and cured by two bottles.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l wish to add my testimony
to the wonderful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I
suffered for nine months, and the cough was so dis-
tressingly bad at nights, I was obliged to get up and sit
by the fire. I had medical advice, and tried other
remedies, without avail. I tried yours, and never had a
fit of coughing after taking the first dose, and though I
have had but two bottles, I feel I am a different man, and
the cough has vanished. You may depend upon my
making known the efficacy of your wonderful remedy to
anyone I see afflicted.—Yours faithfully,

Uric Acid: The Cause of Hany Diseases,
(By “Escu.”
The health of man is influenced to a very great extant by the condition of the kidneys. Any
disease of the kidneys, or interference with their action, a foots the whole system, because the purity
of the blood is dependent upbn the proper extraction from it of certain specific poisons, which it is the
duty of the kidneys to remove.
The kidneys are situated in the small of the back, one on each side of the spine. Human kidneys
are similar in shape to those of a sheep, but are somewhat larger. They are encased in fat, and are
supplied with arteries which convey blood to them from the heart. By a process akin to filtering, the
kidneys take any excess of water from the blood, and they also extract from the blood various waste
poisons with which it becomes laden in its journey through the veins.
When a person is in good health these waste poisons are dissolved in the water taken from the
blood by the kidneys, and the solution is passed through narrow passages leading from each kidney
into the bladder, and is thence expelled from the body. This solution is known as urine. Some of
the poisons contained in urine are animal matter, such as urea and uric acid; others are mineral
matter, being salts of lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.
Unless the kidneys do their work thoroughly, the waste matter is incompletely extracted from
the blood, and becomes actively poisonous, causing us to suffer from various disorders which cannot
be cured until the kidneys are restored to health and activity. _ . .
After the blood is filtered and purified by the kidneys it enters the veins, and is, in due time,
returned to the heart, having, in the meanwhile, traversed the body and taken up a fresh supply of
waste matter. The heart again sends the blood to the kidneys, which once more filter it and extract
the impurities. This process goes en without ceasing day or night.
The kidneys of the average man filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine m
twenty-four hours. In this quantity of urine are dissolved abiut an ounce of urea, and ten or twelve
grains, in weight, of uric acid, together with other animal and mineral matter, varying from a third Ox
an ounce to nearly an ounce. _ . .
The blood, in the course of its circulation, carries nourishment, derived from the food we eat, and
oxygen to every part of the tissues of the body, and receives from the tissues matter which they have
consumed and for which they have no further use. This waste matter it is the duty of the skin, lungs,
and kidneys to throw off and get rid ©f. In the form of carbonic acid, the lungs throw off the equiva-
lent of eight ounces of pure charcoal every twenty-four hours, and the kidneys do their share by
eliminating urea, uric acid, etc., as described.
The principal disorders directly attributed to failure of the kidneys to perform their alloted task
are Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago, Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia, Anaemia, Gravel, Stone
and Bladder Troubles. When the kidneys are properly doing their work none of the complaints
mentioned can exist, because the causative poisons are then duly removed in a natural manner.
The only remedy known to science which is able to establish a regular and healthy action of the
kidneys is Warner’s Safe Cure. This remarkable medicine is the outcome of years of research, and
has been in use throughout the world for more than a quarter of a century. It is the only known
medicine which has the power to expel uric acid from the system, and it owes this power simply to its
ability to restore worn, weak, or diseased kidneys to their natural vigor. Nature does the rest.
thousands suffer from kidney disease and do not know it. The commonest first symptom is pain
in the back. A simple test to make as to the condition of the kidneys is to put some of the urine,
passed the first thing in the morning, into a bottle or covered glass, and let it stand until next
morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if particles float about in it,
then the kidneys are not healthy, and no time should be lost in adopting remedial measures or
Bright’s Disease or some serious illness will be the result.
Remember that Warner’s Safe Cure will in all cases restore the kidneys to health and will con-
sequently cure—and permanently cure—all diseases arising from their feeble condition and the reten-
tion of uric acid in the system.
A treatise containing a full description of the curative action of Warner’s Safe Cure and many
accounts of cases cured will be sent free on application to H. H. Warner and Co., Limited, Austra-
lasian Branch, Melbourne. [3]

A Toast.
[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
I LOVE them all: the grey I ride at dawn,
To match the spirit of the plain,
As furtive Erebus flees further West
Attended by his shadow train,
Leaving flushed Eos trembling there
To check awhile in vain despite
The flaunting pennons flashing bright
That herald Phoebus in his might.
I love them all: the creamy that I guide
When Phoebus beams on sweetheart Earth,
Fresh rescued from the sombre thrall of Night,
And dries her dewy tears in mirth.
And saucy,shafts search through each nook
And forth the rearmost shadows fling,
The while the breezes sweetly sing
His glory through each bough a-swing.
I love them all: the chestnut that I soothe
As he curvets, his feet a-dance—■
His coat aflame with ev’ry fiery hue
That kindles ’neath Apollo’s glance.
’Tis him I ride through noonday heat,
When on the plain the mirage plays,
And scrubs, as islands, swim in haze.
And parching dust-storms sweep the ways.
I Jove them all : the satin-coated bay
I wheel when shine and shadows blend
In sweeping bars across the seared sward,
Proclaiming that the day will end
Quite soon, and join the days long dead,
Mourned by but one pale blinking star
That hangs above the black belar,
While stoekbells softly toll afar.
I love them all : the brown I cross at dusk
When twilight holds her fleeting sway,
And, gently swathed in soothing tender tints,
Tired Busliland rests—a very fay
Delightful to the sun-sick eye ;
While in the east a glimmer soon
Foretells the coming of the moon
To view her face in the lagoon.
I love them all : the black that carries me
When Night, as sable as his hide,
Envelops me, and phantoms, fancy-bred,
Throng by the dreary path I ride,
Marshalled by curlews’ chilling call,
And gusty winds their trystings keep
Where saplings bow their heads and weep
The waters that from heaven sweep. ,
I love them all—and he who loves them not
Lacks something that should be a part
Of all good men : for faithful service breeds
Good-fellowship with each true heart.
So fill your glasses, comrades mine,
It is a manly toast I call—
I drink to love that may not pall:
“ Our stock-horse friends ! I love them all ! ”

N.S.W.
Jerry and Mrs. Jerry.
[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
JERRY’S origin illustrates in part the
process by which the back-country was,
and is still being, stocked with the queerest
set of human beings, outside of an anthropolo-
gist’s collection of subjects.
His father was Jeremiah Pudsey, a lump of
Yorkshire earth, dumped on to a Sydney wharf
from an immigrant ship. Pudsey mooned about
the city for a few days before he made up his
mind to go into the country. He applied at a
registry-office, and was offered a job on a station,
as married couple, £56 a year and food, with fare
one way. The terms were good ; but he was not a
married couple. He knew that much.
“Ah’m not a food,” he said, querulously.
“ Ah can tell me nose fro’ me thoomb, tha knows,
lass.”
The registry woman had a good look at him,
and said—“ I can find you a woman in two shakes
of a lamb’s tail. W’y, bless yer, there’s ’ardly
one couple in ten leaving this office as ‘ married
couples’ that ain’t post-entry, in a manner o’
speakin’. I’ve got a real good sort waitin’ now
for a man. And we don’t haslc no foolish ques-
tions about church; we sends ’em to the stations
as God made’em. We on’y want the silver.”
“Ah’ll coom back an’ tell thee later,” said
Pudsey, and he went off to think it over for a
couple of hours. During the process he had his
Socket picked. He made up his mind, and went
ack to the registry-office.
He inspected the other party, and, perceiving
that she was strong and likely to do her share of
the work, signed on. That night Mr. and Mrs.
Pudsey (as the consignment note described them)
were on their way to a western station as, “ Man
to milk and garden. Woman to cook and wash.
No encumbrances.” And that’s how Jerry got
born.
The first consequence of his advent was the
indignant dismissal of Mr. and'Mrs. Pudsey.
Mrs. Merino was astounded at their “lack of
consideration.”
Pudsey took the woman into the township and
—promptly deserted her, taking the treasury with
him. So Jerry got a very poor start in life. His
mother was by turns a carrier’s wife, offsider to a
hawker, and finally, when Jerry was about five
years old, regularly married to a man who took
fencing contracts, and who, when at home, lived
in a hut on an abandoned block of worthless
mulga country. Here the boy grew up into a tall
youth, with as little knowledge of the world as a
child of three, rarely seeing other than “home”
faces. The stepfather, when Jerry was about
15 years old, tried"'him at axe work, and found
that he would be a very good hand were it not
that he was subject to violent outbursts of passion.
The man at last got tired of keeping him, for he
feared that some day the lad would be too strong
to be thrashed ; so he turned him adrift.
Thus, at the age of 24, Jerry was out in the
world—quite illiterate, very powerful, possessed
of many of the attributes of an aboriginal, abso-
lutely fearless, and almost insensible to pain and
hardship.
He made a name for himself amongst men, but
was truculent, and, being a most dangerous oppo-
nent, soon became a “hatter,’’shunned and feared
by all but a few masters, who found him useful.
He didn’t mind in the least.
But one fine morning in the little town which
had grown up at the terminus of the new railway,
Chinese Kate marked him down, as being likely
to suit her. Kate was not, as her name implied,
an alien; she was merely—well, not particular.
She was not nearly as old as she looked, but the
storm and stress of 25 years of the slum life in a
big city, plus three years of a railway terminus
in the bush, had left her distinctly the worse for
wear.
“So,” to quote old Solomon, “she caught him
and kissed him, and, with an impudent face, said
unto him—‘Come and see me home, ducky.’”
Kate’s voice was almost the first which had ever
addressed him in accents of goodwill; and, besides,
she was a woman, and he, even in an uncouth
way, was a man. Kate saw that he was a
“ softy,” and persuaded him to marry her.
Kate was soon disillusioned as to his
“softness.” In Jerry’s clouded brain one trait
of primitive man came out; he looked upon
her as his property. The first time that
strange men appeared about their humpy on
the outskirts of the town, Jerry beat
them; and, afterwards, beat Kate. This was
followed by an attempt on Kate’s part to
bolt with a carrier; for she feared Jerry now.
He tracked her down, nearly killed the carrier,
and beat Kate again.
Then every morning before he went away he
swept the ground around the humpy quite bare ;
and woe betide Kate if footmark of man was seen
on the holy ground. At last nobody dared to go
near Jerry’s mansion; and Kate was religiously
left alone.
In time J erry got tired of town life, and decided
to go back to the bush. Kate agreed that it
would be best; she could look after the place until
Jerry returned with some more money.
“ You’re cornin’! ” said Jerry, laconically, and
from that there was no appeal.
So Kate went. Her real troubles began then.
She had never walked three consecutive miles in
her whole sodden life, and Jerry had no idea that
he was asking an impossibility of her. He thought
inability was merely disobedience, and he beat
her. On the third day from town she threw her-
self down in despair, and Jerry was standing over
her when a trap, driven by the manager of a
station some CO miles down the river, came
abreast of them. The manager recognised Jerry,
and, having heard particulars of his wedding m
town, pulled up. He said :
“What have you got there, Jerry?*'
“My missus. She won’t walk.”
“Good heavens, man, you cannot expect a
woman to walk like you. She’ll die ! ”
This unsettled Jerry. He looked at Kate and
then at the manager. “ I was going 1 ) ask you to
give me a job as married man when I got down,”
he said.
“All right, Jerry. You can have the two
back paddocks, and there’s a hut where you’ll be
comfortable pound a-week and two rations.
Eh?”
“ All right,” said Jerry.
“You can put the missus in the waggonette
coming a couple of miles behind.”
The clean life set Kate up. Fresh air, whole-
some food, and exercise (Jerry did not cut the
wood) made quite another woman' of her. Yet
the feeling of vigorous health did not make her
Jhanker any the less for the excitement and
debauchery she had left behind.
She had learned that a coach left the station
on Tuesdays for the railway terminus. So
one morning as soon as Jerry was out of
sight in the timber she started along the pad to
walk into the station; 12 miles. She had the
coach-fare, stolen from Jerry’s hoard ; and knew
that once in town the way to the city would be
easy. Jerry crossed the homestead road soon
after his wife had passed through the gate, and of
course noticed her tracks. He followed, caught
up to her, and thrashed her well.
Later, a child was born, and Jerry was the
proudest man in the back-country. The poor
little creature with the wrinkled, weary face of a
very old man, received the love of one wlic
hitherto had lived apart from his kind, as if he were
of a different genus. For eighteen happy months
The Kid (Jerry’s only name for the baby) was his
one thought, and when he was old enough to
notice, Jerry used to bring him all kinds of
curious things out of the bush. The child
never smiled nor cried, but seemed to understand
all his father said to him, and looked at him
gravely and silently, as if he knew of the great
love which was being lavished upon him, and was
wondering.
Jerry changed. He was more companion-
able when he met his fellow-stockmen, and
they won his heart by listening to his tales of
The Kid’s doings.
But Kate was unutterably bored by it all, and
again she contemplated escape. She had dis-
covered where Jerry kept his money, but let it
bide until a safe opportunity to escape should
present itself.
The Kid fell sick. Kate saw her chance, and
said that it should be seen by a doctor. J erry was in
a quandary. He did not want to leave his job, for
The Kid’s sake; yet he did n’t want his wife
to go away by herself. Then he remembered—
poor, simple fellow —that nothing living had ever
got away from him if lie got on its tracks; and
Kate knew that, too, from experience. She could
take the child up by the next coach and return
by the following one. He got some money out of
his “bank,” aiid said to his wife, “Now, you
look after The Kid. ’Ere’s money, and don’t
spare none for him ; and don’t spend none on
yerself, neither. If yer try to get away I ’ll pick
up yer tracks, and when I catch yer”
She listened sullenly, and next morning, after
lifting the balance of Jerry’s hoard, took the
coach. On arriving at the railway terminus she
promptly took the first train to the city. But the
journey just about settled the child’s poor chance
of life; so Kate was free very soon, and back
again in her old haunts, with £6O of Jerry’s
money. She became the old original Kate again
within ten days.
Jerry was in to meet the return-coach. No
Kate, and no Kid.
“ Where’s my little boy ?” he asked the driver.
“ Dunno,” said he ; “I couldn’t find the missus
anywhere. She didn’t go to the doctor, either.
Nobody knew where she went.”
Jerry said no more, but rode back home as
quickly as possible. He looked up his travelling
kit, and went to the “bank” for his money.
“Gone! —my money and my pore little Kid!”
he howled. “I’ll have her life.”
He started away on foot, and did the 84
miles without stopping, excepting once to eat.
He went to the doctor. She had not been
there. At the railway-station he was told that
she had gone to the city. He would go there.
Having no money, he couldn’t go by train. He
would walk there—and he did.
How he managed for the fortnight he stayed in
the city nobody will ever know. In the end he
returned to his district unsuccessful, looking 20
years older, and quite mad. He took to
roaming the country in search of Kate and The
Kid. Bourke to Wilcannia, and back to Bourke;
then to Cunnamulla, and later to Hughenden.
He was quite harmless, and everybody was sorry
for him, so he wanted not for food or clothes, and
he became a well-known figure in the West.
Four years after Kate had run away, Jerry
happened to hear a casual bush spieler, while
telling how he served three months “ on the vag ”
at Bathurst, observe incidentally that Chinese
Kate was also doing a sentence there. Then Jerry
took the road once more.
* * * *
Kate had been doing six mouths for vagrancy,
and, on leaving the prison, had been taken m
hand by the Army. She desired to appear grate-
ful for their efforts, and to see if the Army’s enthusi-
asm would run to the price of a pass back to the
city. So she became “ a brand plucked from the
burning.”
And one evening she was saying, in the circle
standing in the road : “ Once I ’ad a ’appy ’ome,
a sweet child, and a ’usband who thought no
end of me. A wicked man took me away, and I
listened to the voice of the Devil. I left my
’umble ’ut. I took the child ”
A gaunt form broke into the centre of the ring,
amid a clamor of “Hallelujah!” “God bless
you, brother ! ” “ Another soul! ”
The man said : “Where’s my pore sick boy?
Where’s The Kid ? ”
“ My God, it’s Jerry ! ”
“ Where’s The Kid ? ”
“ He died, goin’ in the train, Jerry.”
He reached out a lean, tough arm, naked to the
shoulder, and before the bystanders realised
what was happening, Jerry had choked out the
sodden, ignoble life of Chinese Kate. She had a
holy funeral, having died sanctified. J erry is in a
lunatic-asylum, still asking for his “pore sick
Kid.”

A Martyr for Years.

|OR many years I have been a martyr to Biliousness,” says Mrs. M.
Jordan, of Ivelly-street, Scone, N.S.W. “Almost every fortnight I
. . would have an attack, and try what I would I could get no relief. The
pain m my head was unbearable, also the
pain across the eyes. After eating I
would vomit terribly. I tried many so-
called remedies, but gained no relief. I
then decided to give Bile Beans a trial,
although I had little faith in them after
my experiences with other medicines.
To my surprise I gained relief from the
first dose. Thus encouraged, I continued
with the Beans, following the directions
closely, and now can truthfully say I am
enjoying splendid health, and have never
had a Bilious attack since I first com-
menced to take Bile Beans. My work is
now a pleasure, and my friends have
noticed the great improvement there
is in me. Words cannot express my
gratitude to you for your wonderful
medicine, and 1 hope that many others
suffering from Biliousness will be per-
suaded to try Bile Beans.”

GRANT HERVEY.
A Nicht wi’ Burns.
[FOR THE BUOLLETIN .]
He is a general agent, and we met
through an introduction from a mutual
friend. Mr. George Burns might easily
have been mistaken for an Englishman, speaking
the best English ; I had known him a week before
be betrayed his Scotch parentage by saying “a
wee bit tie,” for “ a little,” in a moment of excite-
ment. \\ e were often together in that first week
and at the end of it he told me he would be
engaged for the next three nights.
“Going away, Mr. Burns?”
just three Robbie Burns dinners.”
He tried to say it carelessly, but involuntarily
his figure straightened from sft. llin. to Gft. 2in
and the blue eyes, that seemed so far-seeing and
business-like in the office, brightened with the
suggestion of a Baresark gleam.
Then I won’t see you for a week, Mr. Burns?”
Wee V at my office every

1 believed him ; but a few nights afterwards, as
I was walking, about midnight, from Vincent-
stieet towards my hotel, a big hand clutched me,
and, as I turned, the bulging shirt-front of George
.burns, the seemingly cold and English agent,
struck mine. The agent’s head was held well
nacic, to preserve the balance of his body, although
even then he rocked unsteadily on his heels. He
Had lost his hat, his hair was t juzled, and his blue
eyes blazed his temporary mania. I put my hand
against the bulging shirt-front that threatened to
smother both of us, and it crackled like dry sticks
under a pot.
His fierce glance changed to a look of abiding
sorrow. &
Hinna do that, laddie—dinna do that! ’Tisa

Avee.v. 1 wadna liae ma sark soiled —’tis a nice

He shed tears over the bulging shirt-front, and
then spread his handkerchief over it, to save it
from damage, saying, explanatorily :

Mr. A. Moyes, Franklin St.,
Adelaide, So. Australia, sends us
his photograph, and says:
“I feel sure that it is to Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla and Pills that I owe
my good health. Previous to
taking this medicine, I had no
appetite and suffered from loss
of sleep. I had no energy to do
or to go anywhere. The doctor
told me to go away for a change.
I did so, and I did not feel any
better after coming back. I came
to the conclusion it was old age
coming on me. Anyhow, I soon
altered my opinion after taking
the Sarsaparilla and Pills. Now
I can eat and sleep well; in -fact,
I feel twenty years younger. And
when West I need never fear the
diet one has to put up with on the
fields, when my medicine-chest
contains a bottle or so of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla and Pills.”
Why is it that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is such a strong nerve tonic ? Why is it
that this family medicine brings back the appetite, makes the nerves steady
and strong, and gives sound and refreshing sleep? The answer is easy.
Because it removes the impurities from the blood which irritate the nerves
and keep them in a restless and weakened condition. When fed with pure
blood, the nerves settle right down to their regular duties; the brain,
stomach, kidneys, and heart all do their work as nature intended.
To get these results you must take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, not some other
kind. The market is full of imitations.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
Purifies the Blood. Strengthens the Nerves.
Ayer's Pills keep the liver active. They aid the Sarsaparilla*
