The Lawsons. — Three Generations .
TALES OF A GRANDFATHER
HIS name was Harry Albury. He was
big’, strong, dark, handsome man, w
came from Kent with his family. Wa
black hair, worn long ; and profi
Roman. His people were supposed to have bee
gypsies, and lie was very gypsy-like in his habit
He had sight like a blackfellow, and was a firs
class bushman of the old school. A humourist o
the loud-voiced order. When he was sixty 1
could handle timber and knock out palings anc
shingles with any young man. He had the heac
of an intellectual man, a strong man, a leader o
men, but he couldn't read or write —a fact wliic
he hid successfully from mail}’. He liked to cam
by himself in the bush. " 1 never had no eddicr
tion, ’ he’d sa ; and he did n’t see what his chi
dren wanted with it. He drank. At home 1
had been known to smash all the crockery anc
bring home a string of pint-pots and a pile of ti
plates and dump them on the table.
He was very mysterious, and seldom did thing
like other men. For instance, he’d go to Mudgt
and nuy a string of boots for the family, but 1
would n’t bring them home. No, not lie. He c
roar at one of the girls : “ D’ yer see that shalle
digger s hole up there on the sidin’ ? ”
“Yes. Father.”
. “Then go up there; yer’ll find a piece of bar
m the bottom, lift it up an’ see what yer’ll find.
And the girls would find the boots. Agaii
when they were married and had families, he ’c
visit them in turn, and most unexpectedly o
course, once in years. But he - would n’t come u
to the door and knock. No. In the morning tl
daughter or one of the children would look oi
and see a big man standing at the gate with h
Kick to the house, or, more likely, leaning on
fence across the road. Then : “ Why, there
Father!” or “Why, there’s Grandfather !” an
he’d be brought in. He would be very clean, anc
have on a full new suit of tweed, with maybe
dandy pair of shoes and a little strip of leather a
the bottom of his pants; but his old greasy hat.
“Father, why did n’t you get another hat?”
“What do I want with another hat? I hain
got two heads, have I ? ”
He’d leave as unexpectedly as he came.
J*
He nearly always shouted at the top of h
voice, and it was a big voice.
“ Mr. Albury, why do you speak so loud ? ”
Grandfather (roarinr/).- “BECAUSE I WANT
PEORLE TO HEAR ME ! ”
I ve seen a man roll on the ground and shriek a
something Grandfather said, and heard him, wit
a face as solemn as a Judge’s, tell that man to ge
up and not be a “ thund’rin’ jumped-up fool.”
Save for “ thund’rin’,” or “jumped-up,” I neve
heard Grandfather swear. There’s a legend t
the effect that once, in his young days, h
swore so badly at his bullocks that he frightened
himself ; but I don’t believe that.
J*
I worked with him now and again in the moun
tains in the ’eighties, humping palings and rail
out of gullies. He was taking care of an empty
house, and camping there. He “ had the writin’s
(a letter from the owner, authorising him as care
taker). He had great faith in “ writin’s.”
An ordinary fire would n’t do Grandfather ; he’d
pile on logs till he roasted us to the back of the
room, and sometimes outside altogether. He was
a good cook and very clean in camp ; he’d polish
up his tin-ware till he could shave in it. Saturda>
afternoon or Sunday morning he’d clean up. The
furniture and things would be chucked out with
great noise and clatter—the furniture was home
made and strong and could stand it. Then Grand
father would take off his boots, tuck up his
trousers, and arm himself with a broom and
mop. My business was to run to the tank anc
back as fast as I could with two buckets. We
camped in an outhouse, and when the house was
let he was asked to clean it out for the new tenant
It was a great cleaning—l ’ll never forget it. They
say the house was damp all Summer—but it was
clean.
He could n’t do things like an ordinary man. He
was fond of dogs, little mongrel dogs, and he ’d
talk to them, and they seemed to understand.
But if a strange dog came sneaking around Grand-
father would lay for bun He would n’t attack
that dog in the ordinary way ; he’d heave a chair,
or table, or something equally handy. I remem-
ber a big, hairy, thievish dog used to come sneak-
ing round. Grandfather laid for him. He had
just finished making a picket gate, and it stood
inside the door. It was dark inside and broad
moonlight in the yard, and when the dog sneaked
into the yard he did n’t see us. Suddenly Grand-
father jumped up, seized the gate, and hove it. It
missed the clog by a hair, struck on one corner,
and smashed to smithereens. I never saw that
dog again.
He was a great man in Mudgee in the early days.
He cleared the main street, and owned blocks of
land in town. He lost them. Amongst other
things he was an undertaker. He buried many,
and under all sorts of conditions—some in sheets
of bark ; and he was in great demand at funerals.
He usually had a coffin cut out roughly and stuck
up over the tie-beams of the kitchen to season,
and wait. The family hated this sort of thing.
They say he generally luxcl an eye on a prospec-
tive client too, and cut his coffin accordingly.
Jones, the legitimate undertaker, made a pali-
sading for a child’s grave, gave it a coat of paint,
and stood it outside his shop to dry. Grandfather
coming along, vaulted into the palisading, took
hold of each side, lifted it and ran, with Jones out
and after him. Grandfather ran up a blind lane,
dropped the palisading; and jumped the fence.
Jones took his palisading back in a dray, and
nothing would convince him that Grandfather
did n’t want to steal it.
The old man would suddenly go down on his
knees in the middle of the street, and stare hard
at a stone till the floating population gathered
round and put its hands on its knees and stared
too. Then he’d get up and go away. And they’d
stare harder after him than they had at the stone.
The last time I saw him in Sydney he’d bought
some tools and a new carpenter’s bag to carry them
in. He put the handle of an adze through the
loop of the bag and carried it across his back. Out
° ne s^e stuck an auger and out of the other the
blade of a saw. He walked straight down the
middle of George-street, towards Redfern railway
station—the tram wasn’t there then—and he
walked fast. It was Saturday evening, and the
street was pretty full. Every few yards a passen-
ger coming in the opposite direction, would catch
sight of the point of the saw or auger, and duck
just in time to save an eye or an ear. Heads were
bobbing to right or left all the way. I saw no
trace of anger on any of their faces. Just mild,
startled surprise. Just such an expression as a
man might wear who has nearly stumbled against
a cart coming out of a lane. An uncle and I
walked behind the old man all the way, and en-
joyed the show. One would have thought that
he was absolutely unconscious of the mild sensa-
tion ho was creating, but we knew the old man
better than that.
I don’t remember ever hearing Grandfather
augh Little Jimmy liowlett, the bullock-driver
[iMowlett in my books), could throw some light on
the subject. One day he was out, looking for a
bullock in the scrub just outside Mudgee, and had
sit down to rest and smoke on a log on the edge
of a little clearing about fifty yards from the road,
when he saw Grandfather coming along. The old
man seemed rather more mysterious than usual,
and Jimmy watched him—he thought perhaps he
had come to look for some timber. Grandfather
glanced round very cautiously, like a blackfellow,
but lie did n’t see Jimmy. Then he started to
1 e llg , ‘ lan 2 h< ? d till the tears ran down his
cheeks. He put his hands on his hips and roared
till lie doubled up, then, when he recovered, he
straightened himself, composed his face, and went
baea whence he’d come. And thereafter it worried
Jimmy a good deal at times, for he never could
find out what Harry Albury was laughing at tha;
day.
I have moods now, sometimes, when I fee
inclined to go out of the world a piece and laugh
But then I am growing old.
Father used to work with Grandfather as
young man, and there are many anecdotes.
Father got on with him famously, - 'and I neve
met two characters more opposite in every way
Add to this the fact that Father was a tota
abstainer. Father used to sav that the one thin
he liked and admired the old man for, above a]
else, was that he’d never harp on a string—he ’c
say a thing and have done with it.
I never heard the old man say an ill word o
anybody. The worst things I remember of him
were : First, he drank—but I drink too. Second
he would seldom sack a man for whom he had no
further use—lie’d wait for an excuse to have i.
row with him, and the man would leave burstinj
with indignation, and burning with a sense o
injustice : but that was, in a way, in keeping
with the old man’s character. Third : He go)
nearly all his stringy-bark palings out of mountain
ash ; but that was due (a) to the prejudice of his
clients (who could never hope to live as long as
that timber) in favour of stringv-bark, (b) the
extreme scarcity of stringy-bark, - (<fl the preva
•ence of mountain-ash. I ourth : Hens used to
come round our camp for what they could pick
up, and were encouraged, and often picked up
more than they came for and left but their heads
but then I was fond of poultry too, and the blame,
if any, was on our gypsy ancestry.
j.he old man usually had an old horse, bony and
angular past description, popularly believed to be
as old as himself, and locally known as “Old
Albury ” too. The old man fed the old horse
well, but no power on earth could ever fatten him.
(1 ve noticed that bosses who are extra fond of
animals are, usually hardest on their men.) I
remember seeing the old man throwing out some
corn he kept for the horse to a stray fowl. He
explained that he was fattening that fowl up for
Christmas. I asked if the hen belonged to him,
and he said No, not exactly, but he thought it
would about Christmas time. He bought a fowl
occasionally, for the sake of appearance and to
provide against accidents. He had, as I, said, the
sight of a blackfellow, and would bring his heavv
eyebrows together and peer at something in the
distance, standing and looking for the moment
just like a blackfellow, and seeing as far.
I got on well with him, and was, I think, the
only one in the family who could get him to sing.
He had a good voice, and I used to read old songs
to him and he d get them line by line. Like most
illiterate men, he remembered nearly all he had
ever seen or heard. Supposed to be without senti-
ment, I discovered him to be a dumb poet— a poet
of the trees, the timber,” and all living things
amongst or in them. Supposed to be without
affection, 1 know that in his old age, when the
family was scattered and he alone, he made a long
and useless journey just to have a look at the
ruins of the church he was married in.
Granny was the daughter of an English clergy-
man. She came out to Australia as an immigrant
and went into domestic service Penrith way,
where she met Grandfather, who looked like'a
young god then ; and married him for his looks.
She went with him over the mountains, and went
through forty years of a rougher bush life than you
could imagine. She was good, and well-meaning,
&nd old-fashioned and helpless. The diggers on
Pipeclay in its flush days once proposed sub-
scribing to send my Mother to England to have
her voice trained, but Granny would not hear of
it, for she had a horror of any of her children
“ becoming public.”
H.L.
MOTH ER AND SON
IT is curious to find mother and son publishing
each in the same month a book of verses:
to note their identity of aims, of moods, of
manners-allowing for the accidents of ’sex
and epoch. Without doubt Henry Lawson is
temperamentally his mother’s child, as she is
temperamentally the child of her father—the
whimsical wanderer whom Lawson describes in
the columns preceding.
Who wrote “ The Digger’s Daughter”?'
The waratah las stained her cheek,
Her Ups are even brighter ;
Like virgin quartz without a streak
Her teeth are, but far whiter.
Her eyes are large, and soft, and dark,
And clear as running water ;
And straight as any stringy hark
Is Lil, the digger’s, daughter...
Anybody might recognise that as one of Lawson’s
earlier verses. Bat it appears in Mrs. Lawson’s
book of The Lonely Crossing and Other Poems.
Who wrote “ The Water Lily ” ?
A lonely young wife
In her dreaming discerns
A lily-decked pool
With a border of ferns,
And a beautiful child
With butterfly wings,
Trips down to the edge of the water and sings :
“ Come, mamma ! come !
Quick ! follow me—
Step out on the leaves of the water-lily ! ”
That is a verse from Lawson’s When I was King
and Other Verses —a verse that would appear
naturally in his mother’s book.
His sympathy, his sincerity, his power of keen
observation : Lawson inherits them all from his
mother. As a girl she loved poetry and scribbled
verses : as a woman she was revoltress as he is
revolter from the smug conventional order —
espousing the cause of downtrodden women as he
has defended the attitude of luckless, striving
men. The pulses of both beat higher for the ideal
of Australia. And unluckily, at times, they both
have seen life gloomily, through the shadows of
'their “wrongs.”
Friends will quickly leave you,
Slight you and deceive you,
Or will not believe you
If you have a wrong—
writes Mrs. Lawson. And her son writes :
But, oh ! beware of bitterness
When you are wronged, my l id—
I wish I had the, faith in men
And women that I had !
And alas ! sensitive and noble natures, brooding
over “wrongs” real or imaginary, may become
suspicious and soured.
This has to be noted and remembered when one
considers the Lawsons’ representations of Aus-
tralia in verse. Henry Lawson is aged 38 ; Mrs.
Peter Lawson is 57; yet her verses are less
gloomy than ii is, less self-conscious, less
querulous: he has to carry the burden
of another generation. “The Lonely Crossing”
is the story of a dying swagman, and the idea of
death colours too many of the verses; but Mrs.
Lawson’s mood is rather melancholy than gloomy,
and the verses “of widowed years were written
for solace when under stress of pain, and sorrow.”
Others “were composed before leaving school,
ahd others later on with babe at nurse.” The
form is often smooth and careful, and odd verses
show decided poetic faculty—if the writer’s wings
could bear her continuously on the same level.
I care not what thy failings are,
Thy faults I would not see,
I only knew I loved thee well
And thought thee dear to me . . .
Or with a stronger note :
How did she fight ? She fought well.
How did she light ? Ah, she fell.
Why did she fall ? God, who knows all,
Only can tell.
Or note the epithets in this :
For you love to look on the lotus feast,
And drift in a westering way ;
But I’ve set my face to the pregnant east
Where I ivatch for a broad, new day.
Here is a graphic picture of “Coming Home ” :
Going round the bach street,
Through the twilight lane,
While the folk at church meet—
Coming home again.
Faded hat and creasy,
Long since it was 'new ;
Tent-fly torn and greasy,
Bluey shelving through,
Billy burnt and battered,
Boots all badly burst,
Lace and lace-holes shattered,
Trousers at their worst.. .
Young face lined and sunburnt,
Hair just turning grey ;
Many a lesson unlearnt
Since he went a way.
But he need not bother,
There \s a bite and sup ;
And for all the other —
Mother’ll fix him up.
It is _ a little book of primitive verse: but
keenly felt, and sometimes adequately expressed.
■J*
The book When I Was King is below Henry
Lawson’s reputation, and below his merit. It was
a mistake to collect in a Volume so many casual
newspaper verses, so many jaundiced reflections
of bitter hours. These are not the best of Lawson,
but the worst; and he has written so much that is
good, and strong, and brave, that one cannot be
satisfied with dismal doggerel of the alleys and
the pubs. It is necessary to say this, for Lawson
is regarded as a representative Australian author :
he is possibly the most original and characteristic
author that this country has produced ; but his
vision includes only a small arc of the Australian
horizon, and the foreigner who relies upon him
alone for a picture of Australia will be led very
far astray. His woeful pictures must not be taken
as fully descriptive of the Bush, and his miserable
broodings are far from depicting the cheerful
courage of the men and women of the Bush.
When he can get rid of his incubus of Black
Care, Lawson is still worth reading. In this
volume, which in point of form and style is
the worst he has published, there are lines
and verses that have some of the old humour
and the old intensity. The ballad of “ The Elder
Son ” is a very human statement of the other side
of things—and Lawson could have written it
better in prose. Racy sketches in the vernacular,
like “The Fourth Cook,” “Knockin’ Around,”
and “ L’lie Good Samaritan,” will come home to
hundreds of hearts. Others, like “ The Wander-
Light”—
And ny dreams are strange dreams , are day- dreams,
. are grey dreams,
And my dreams are wild dreams.and old; dreams and
new.;
They haunt me and daunt me with fears of the morrow —
My brothers they doubt me—but my dreams come true ......
For my ways are strange ways and new ways-and old
ways,
And deep ways and steep ways and high ways and low;.
I’m at home and at ease on a track that I know not,
And restless atul lost on a road that I knew—
have the phrase and pulse of poetry and it is-a;
pity to drop to the abyss of
They are standing up grand, Toby Barton and See,
Anl Australia's all right, you can take it from me;
At times energy comes back in lines like these::
Ay, the cities claim the triumphs of a land they do not
know,
But all empty is the. day they celebrate !
For the. men who made A ustralia federated long ago,
And the men to rule Australia—they can wait.
Though the bed may be the rough bunk or the gum leaves
or the sand,
And the roof for half the year may be the sky —
There are men aig. "s H the Bushmen who were bom to
save the lan. f
And they'll take tKevhplaces sternly by-and-by .....
Round the camp-fire of the fencers by the furthest panel
west,
In the men’s hrct by the muddy billabong,
On the Great North- Western Stock-routes where the drovers
never rest,
They are sorting out the right things from the wrong.
In the shearers’ hut the slush-lamp shows a haggard
stem-faced man
Preaching war against the Wool-King to his mates ;
And wherever go the billy, water-bag and frying-pan,
They are drafting future histories of States!
If Lawson will leave himself and his troubles
right out of his writing, and use his good eyes and
his good heart to write the joys and sorrows of
other people—especially the joys—his future work
will be a great deal more satisfactory.

T. C. Lothian, Melbourne, is publishing a new
book for Bernard O’Dowd, The Silent Land anct
Other Verses. The title-piece contains about 170
stanzas, with “the inner life” for their leading
theme. f 4
George Meredith unfortunately slipped the
other day and fractured a leg —“ a simple frac-
ture ”; but Meredith’s simplicity is so complex
that his friends are anxious. At 77 one should be
content to break hearts.
Paradise, by Alice Brown (Lond., Constable
2s. 6c?.), is a little picture of New England life
very well painted. The author might have been
an early Dutch artist, so lovingly does she linger
upon the small, intimate details that take shape
and glow under her hand. “ These sayings are
faithful and true,’’ the author quotes; and the
words might be applied to her own work. Uncle
Timmie, the humourist, is a treat that intelligent
readers should not miss.
W. Tuckwell’s Horace comes aptly in Bell’s
series of “miniature biographies” (Is. net) to illustrate
some recent remarks. The book gives a good glimpse
of the man and the artist.
Somebody has been “ pulling the leg ” of our
estimable contemporary The Studio, which in its issue of
Oct. 14 prints a notice of “the recent exhibition” of
N.S.W. Art Society that deals chiefly with the exhibition
of September, 1904. Despite the confusion of dates, the
contributor ladles butter with a generous hand to un-
deservers.
An Australian Point of View, by F. A. Russell
(Syd., Angus & Robertson ; 'is.), considers current social
and political questions. The writer’s ideas, democratic
and patriotic, are expressed lucidly and intelligently ; and
his pamphlet, with allowance for points of individual
difference, may be accepted as a sound and useful state-
ment
Notes From My South Sea Log , by Louis Becke
(Lond., Laurie ; 2s. Gel.), exhibits a familiar author agree-
ably. Becke has frankly ceased endeavouring to shape
his work into literary form, and contents himself with
reeling off conversational “ yarns ” of his Australian boy-
hood and his Island cruises. Everything conies in ; and
nearly everything is what the average man likes to hear
about—fishing and shooting, beach-combing and beach-
fighting, the merits of brown girls and the delinquencies
of missionaries. Becke’s memory stands to him wonder-
fully. He had always a good dramatic sense ; and, now
that he takes no pains at all, his books are as good
company as himself (bar the stutter)—and
always the best of company. The South Sea Log can be
commended to solitary men wanting somebody to frater-
nise with.
The Anomalies of the Industrial Arbitration Act,
1901 : A Criticism of the Act and its Administration Hi
the First Court of Arbitration in New South Wales, bv
N. Bay (Syd., Gordon and Gotch : 6 d.). Acute an_
interesting : worth consideration.
Sullivan and Co., by A.J.O. (Hobart: 77
Clipper.) Graphic stories of the exploits of three
scoundrels in Tasmania. The matter has adventurous
interest; and the writer presents it as plainly and flatly
as if he were adding a column of skeletons.
The Magazine of Commerce justifies one’s original
commendation, and is commended anew to the notice of
Australian merchants. It grows irksome to read month
after month, upon this maga.’s “ enquiries page,” scores )t
notices from enterprising Canadian firms desiring to do
business with Britain, and notices from British firms
demanding to do business with Canada ; yet not one
announcement from or to Australia.
The Professor s Legacy, by Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick
(Lond., Arnold ; 2s. Gd.) is an attractive story, supplying
new variations on the old theme ; that of the girl who
marries reluctantly, and after marriage has to woo and
win a reluctant husband. This husband is a long time in
being won, and is very dull in wooing : features necessary
for the development of the story—and the delineation of
English character.

during a period of over 30 years is the best proof of
their shooting qualities. They always give satisfac-

Indigestion & Rheumatism.
A THOROUGH CURE.
Tho Case of
Mr. J. TYE.
(By a Special .Reporter.)
The public will be interested to
learn now it came about that Mr.
Jacob Tye threw off a serious illness
that had overtaken him, and full de
tails of the fortunate event will be
found in the following conversation,
which took place at his residence, .No
19 Victoria-street, Alexandria :
Mr. Tye : “Two years last month 1
was laid up with rheumatism and in-
digestion, and if ever a man felt that
his term on this planet was just about
ended it was 1. Such acute pains a?
those which had entered my shoulders
and arms you could not imagine, and
1 felt so stiff and sore that it took
me all my time to get out of bed in
tho morning, let alone work."
Rcpoi ter : “Had you been suffering
from those complaints for any length
of time ?"
Mr. Tye : “Yes ; far too long for my
liking, and I earnestly hope that J
shall never have such experiences
again. In one way I would rather be
dead than go through the same
agony, for it was really too dreadful
for words. I tried all ’ sorts of lini-
ments for the rheumatism, but even
temporary relief did not come from
them ; and as for taking medicine in-
ternally —well, it was not my fault
that 1 did not get better, for 1 took
plenty of it. lor months my diges-
tive organs were on strike—wonldn t
do their work at all, in fact—and
there is no doubt that the nossibilitv
of getting well again seemed very re-
mote. It was an extraordinary thing
if for half a day my head was not
aching, and I do not tnink anybody
could be more troubled with giddiness
than i was. it was a peculiar feeling,
as if I was on the point of fainting,
and what also assisted in adding to
my physical troubles was a sensation
in my chest as if the breathing tubes
were clogged up. Of a morning the
taste I had in my mouth was enough
to turn one sick, 'but 1 had enough 'of
that as it was, for after every meal 1
vomited the food up again almost di-
rectly, and getting as thin as I did
was only a natural consequence.”
Reporter : “Perhaps you ate too
heartily, and took more food than the
weakened condition of your stomach
could withstand
Mr. Tye : “There was no fear of that
for my appetite was too poor. No ; if
1 only took a couple of biscuits L
would vomit them up again, so you
can see what a critical state 1 was in.
One day I was seized with cramps all
over me, and I had to come home and
lie up for a couple of weeks. Oh, I
thought I. was done for then, and the
way my loins used to ache was some-
thing fearful. 1 was so restless that I
could not get half as much sleep as L
wanted—just dozing off in fits and
starts like —and 1 never slept but what
i. had dreams of a most repulsive char-
acter ; that my nerves were all broken
down was quite evident from the way
in which 1 used to tromble if anything
out of the way occurred, and 1 became
the victim of an uncontrollable cranki-
ness that used to arise on the least
provocation. Truly, 1 got excited and
bad tempered sometimes for nothing,
although I tried hard enough not to,
and the longer I suffered the more dis-
mal in mind I became. I felt that 1
had no desire for anything—no amuse-
ment, no work, no company—nothing
at all, in fact, except to lie down and
remain as quiet as possible. Many a
day 1 came home with a sinking feel-
ing, which induced me to say that I
wanted some noU'rishment, but directly
it was placed before me I’d turn
against it. But there was something
else that worried me a great deal.””
Reporter : “Yes ; what was that ?”
Mr. Tyo : “My. noart, for the way it
palpitated, especially if I had been ex-
erting myself in the Jeast, was some-
thing terrible, and when I retired at
night, after lying down a little while
it would start fluttering in a most dis-
tressing manner. Naturally enough l
thought 1 had some torm of heart dis-
ease. but soon after accepting a
friend’s advice, and starling on a
course of Clements Tonic, all doubts
on that question were settled for the
heart/s action became as regular as it
could be. I'hat was a great relief to
my mind, I can tell you, and didn t I
leel delighted to know that at last l
had got a remedy that was really able
to do me some good '! Don t lor a mo-
ment think that L am overdrawing aiy
story, as 1 have no reason lor doing
so, and it is nothing but the plain
truth when l tell you that Clements
Tonic actually saved my life, tor when
1 started on it 1 was almost too weak
to move, and I bad certainly nothing
to expect from any other medicine!
Nothing J had hitherto tried could
lessen in tbo slightest degree my rheu-
matic pains, but 1 can honestly say
that Clements Tonic gave me relief in
a few weeks, and by continuing with
the same remedy I was freed from
those torments altogether. Oh, how
thankful I was for all that, yet other
benelits still awaited me."
Reporter : “In respect to your di-
gestion, 1 suppose
Mr. Tye : “In every possible way 1
benelited by the use of Clements Tonic,
and 1 reckon there is nothing in- crea-
tion to equal it for giving an appetite
to a sick person. Why, Clements Tonic
made me eat so that 1 never lelt satis-
fied, and it was a healthy appetite,
too, for J. never felt uncomfortable af-
ter eating. And weren’t my people sur-
prised at the way 1 was comino round
again—right back from the grave, 1
might say—and what a treat it was
to feel some vigour and strength run-
ning through my frame once more. My
nerves were setile-d and invigorated to
a remarkable degree, and it was not
long before J ceased turning about at
nights instead of sleeping soundly, and
my sleep was not marked by frightful
dreams as was previously tho case. No;
in every way 1 had improved beyond
recognition, my sunken cheeks having
filled out, and there was an air of ac-
tivity a-bout me that had been lacking
for months past. Constipation had
troubled me considerably, but by tak-
ing Dr. Fletcher’s pills wit-h the Cle-
ments Tonic 1 soon got over that dif-
ficulty permanently, and from tho day
1 was cured over two years ago my
health has been as sound- as a boll. I
ought to make special' mention of the
promptitude with winch Clements To-
nic stopped the vomiting after meals,
and when that was done 1 made
wholesale progress, and soon lost
every pain and ache.”
Reporter : “Well, if you are agree-
able your narrative will appear iu~ tho
paners V'”
Mr. Tye : “And J trust every sull'erer
in the land may read it. Certainly,
publish tho facts Tve given you how
and when you please.’’

The Song of Love’s Passing.
Oyez ! Oycz!
Love is passing by this way.
You can hear her all along,
Bringing song, making song.
Oh, the glad surprise of her !
Merry way and wise of her !
Look in the two eyes of her !
Long you ’ll look, and looking, long.
You can see her all in white
Bringing light, making light;
Light entangled in her hair,
On her raiment snowy fair ;
Love must aye be debonair—
Always Love must walk in white.
See you everywhere she goes
Each bud blows, lifts and blows,
All to touch the feet of her.
Winds a kiss entreat of her ;
Oh, the breath is sweet of her
Down the winding way she goes !
Love is past ! The clear skies blur
Wanting the dear grace of her.-
Silence falls on bough and spra v.
Clouds are creeping up the day,
Chill breeze falters down the way—
Ah me, the vanished face of her !
QUEENSLAND.

O lightsome leaps the lieai t when the year is i’
the gold !
When the skies are big with promise that the
fates may not withhold.
When we gather in full measure
Where the year has spilt her treasure—

When the year is i’ the gold !
There’s a love for every lover wlun the year is i’

In the pulsing blue-veiled distance !
O the glory of existence
When the year is i’ the gold !
But listless lags the heart when the year is i’ the
grey,
When the bee has quit the blosscm, and bright
love has flown away.
When the wind-swept leaves are heap ng

Saved from the envious years,
We smile on thee, and yet
My eyes are dim with tears !
0 quaint, O sad spinet !
Forgotten melodies
Entrance the listening air,
As, sinking on my knees,
I raise a loving prayer •
Above thy silent keys.
A prayer for them who bent
In rapture, long ago,
O’er thee, sweet instrument 1
Charmed by the silver flow
Now in thy soul fast pent.
A prayer for us who gaze
On thine old-fashioned form
(With tender words of praise),
I lotsam from Time’s fierce storm,
Wonder of modern days !
0 sad, 0 quaint spinet !
Relic of lon«- ago,
Farewell! With fond regret
We leave thee ; soft and slow—
O quaint, O sad spinet !
DOROTHY FRANCES McCRAE.
An Undertaking Ode.
I pass the Undertakery each early morn at three,
When I go home from toiling on the Daily
Pharisee.
I pass the coffin-factory at deadest hours of night,
And hear the hammers pounding there for some
departed wight.
They seem to beat a lullaby—a sort of tombstone
tune—
Those merry hammers chorusing their ancient
graveyard rune !
The ghastly caskets glisten there in stately rows
and piles—
There’s rosewood and mahogany in stock in many
styles !
Their silver handles beckon me, when I go home
at three—
And I am fascinated by the Undertakery.
I wonder who’s the customer the ghouls are toil-
ing o’er—
Is someone dead who should have died a century
before ?
A poet or a publican ?—I wish that I could see
The craft that they are launching to the wormy
ceinet’ry!
Is it a narrow casket built to hold some bony
seer,
Or a capacious envelope for one who peddled
beer ?
Are they engaged in sending forth a sinner or a
saint ?
They varnish them alike and there’s no difference
in the paint.
But all the time the hammers go a-clattering on
with glee,
And someone’s being published in the Under-
takery.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

Observations by Great Observers
From the Autobiography of HERBERT SPENCER, VoU 11, Page 167,
American Edition.
“The presentation watch named in Prof. Youman’s letter, was one of
those manufactured by the Waltham Watch Company It has
proved a great treasure as a timekeeper, and has excited the envy of friends
who have known its performances.”*
*“I find in a letter written in December, 1880, after the watch had been in my possession
fourteen years, a paragraph respecting it which may fitly be quoted:— ‘ I have several times
intended to tell you how wonderfully well my American watch has been going of late. It has
always gone with perfect regularity, either losing a little or gaining a little; but of course it has
been difficult to adjust its regulator to such a nicety as that there should be scarcely any loss or
gain. This, however, was done last summer. It was set by the chronometer-maker in July, and
it is now half a minute too slow ; never having varied
more than half a minute from the true time since the
period when it was set. This is wonderful going.
As the Admiral says, one might very well navigate a
ship by it.’ ”
(“ In 1890 it went with equal nicety; lost 42 seconds in half a year.”)

HERBERT SPENCER.
RALPH WALDO EMERSON.
From a drawing made in 1857 by S. W. Rowse,
now in possession of O. E. Norton.
RALPH WALDO EMERSON, the Concord Philosopher, used the Waltham
Watch as a type of the highest development when he wrote in one of his.
Essays on Eloquence, in speaking of a man whom he described as a leader
and a God-send to his community:
He is put together like
a Waltham Watch.”
The REV. R. J. CAMPBELL, in a
sermon preached at the City Temple,
London, on Sunday, September 18th, 1904, spoke as follows :
“ When I was in the United States last year, I visited the well-known
Waltham Watch Factory ; some of you now are wearing the products of this
American manufactory. Do you understand, or do you ever try to under-
stand how it is that you are able to afford these articles as compared with
the earlier day ? I will tell you : It is because the brains of a whole army
of men are concentrated in that marvellous institution. I remember asking
my guide, as we went from room to room, £ How many watchmakers of an
older day do you estimate sit on each of those stools, and the men who do
the work by machinery —how many are they equivalent to ? ’ He replied:
‘ Everyone you see at work here is equivalent to fifty at the very least of
operators who lived before this day, conscientious and able though they may
have been.’ Inventions have increased the working value of every individual
man; they have raised the level of the productive output of the civilised
world. So it is in a higher region/'

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1905.
CARRUTHERS’ ANTI-FEDERAL
UPHEAVAL.
(1) That this House desires to express its profound dis-
satisfaction with the treatment accorded to this State by
the Federal Parliament in many matters of serious con-
cern, and more especially in regard to the selection of the
Federal territory for the seat of government.
(2) That the Government should, by as simple and
effective a means as it can devise, afford the electors of
this State an opportunity to express their opinion on the
aforesaid subject.
On the last day of the session of N.S.W. State
Parliament that small, peevish, political insect,
State Premier Carkuthers, sneaked through the
two hazy and uncertain resolutions quoted above.
In the Assembly they were carried by means of
the closure. The closure was applied almost as
soon as Carruthers had told his strange and
tearful story of how his State had been wronged
by the villain of the melodrama, and almost as
soon as signs of hostility began to appear ; even the
Leader of the Opposition was not allowed to
speak, and in disgust he retired with his following
and left Joseph and his crowd to “resolve”
all by themselves. In the Upper House the
resolutions came on late at night, at the
hour when the burglar and the dog-thief are
abroad, and at feast one M.L.C., who would
have opposed them, states that he was got
out of the way by something as near as pos-
sible to direct falsehood, being informed that
there was really no business left to attend to, save
one Bill of little or no importance. The alleged
grievances which Carruthers cited as a reason
for his misty lamentation were mostly either
direct untruths or misrepresentations that came
as near to being directly untrue as was possible
without actually arriving there; and while the
means were crooked the end was nothing in par-
ticular. Possibly there is going to be a refer-
endum; possibly there isn't. Carruthers, at all
events, didn't directly propose a referendum or
directly ask authority to take one. If there is to
be one, nobody knows when it will happen, or
how. The questions to be submitted to the
people, supposing there is some kind of a refer-
endum, were not laid before Parliament. Even
the indefinite Joseph was never quite so indefinite
before, and he never will be any more indefinite
again, for such a thing isn’t possible.
• * * *,
Out of the tangled wilderness of mental scrub
and intellectual sand which made up Carruthers’
cry of woe it is possible to dig out these eleven
statements to begin with :
Fikst Grievance : That “New South Wal.-s, when she
joined this union and accepted the compact, made certain
sacrifices.” What sacrifices N.S.W. made that weren’t
equally made by the other States Joseph neglected to
mention. Probably he had reasons for his neglect.
Second Grievance : That “ New South Wales entered
with reluctance into the Federation, and as the statutory
majority was not obtained at the first referendum a con-
ference of the Premiers of the various States met in Mel-
bourne and agreed to make a compromise.” This pose
that N.S.W. was “led” or “beguiled” or “duped” or
dragged with reluctance into Federation by the other
States is a comparatively new falsehood. It was N.S.W.
which led the way and asked the other States to join it,
and two or three years ago Parkes and Reid (of
N.S.W.) were held up to admiration as the fathers
and founders of the union, and the fact that the
“initial impulse” came from N.S.W. couldn’t be suffi-
ciently enthused over. In fact the enthusiasm was
deafening. If N.S.W. was “reluctant,” as alleged, it
shouldn’t have led the way till it got over its reluctance,
and it is too much to pose at one and the same time as
the father and founder and leader of the Federation, and
as the small yellow dog that was dragged into it tied by a
bit of string at the end of the cart. Moreover, N.S.W.
did give the statutory majority for Federation as agreed
upon between the States at the first referendum, but by a
shameless act of ill-faith the degraded State Parliament
broke its agreement and raised that statutory majority
from 50,000 to 80,000, whereby the people’s decision at the
first referendum was cancelled and annulled.
Third Grievance : That the right of N.S.W. to carry
its woes to the Privy Council at the far end of the world
has been done away with, and that it can now get
justice from its own High Court, composed of three
judges, two of them New South Welshmen. In other
words, it can no longer import its law. The other States
are in the same position, but they aren’t weeping over it.
Carruthers says that a New South Welshman (Barton)
is responsible for this horror.
Fourth Grievance: That “the Senate rejected a vote
of £lOOO towards the upkeep of the Federal Government
House in Sydney.” This statement was flatly untrue.
The Senate passed the vote just as it stood, and it still
stands.
Fifth Grievance: That N.S.W. was swindled out of a
member at last Federal election. “ The population
returns were made out, and they showed that N.S.W.
was entitled to 27 members as against the existing
number, 26, and Victoria to 22 members as against 23.
When these returns by the statisticians were made up
the Federal Government said they were wrong . . . The
consequence was that N.S.W. was denied its proper
representation.” And in every essential particular this
beautifully circumstantial yarn is bald, naked and wicked
fabrication. When the Federal election took place at the
end of 1903 N.S.W. got as many members as its own
statistician’s figures showed it to he entitled to. About a
year or 18 months later it was reckoned that its popula-
tion had so increased as to entitle it to another member,
and a Bill was brought in to put this matter right in time
for next election.
* * * *
Sixth Grievance: That the N.S.W. State Governor
(Beauchamp) was “ bustled out ” to make room for the
Federal Governor-General. It was the N.S.W. State
Government that bustled him out, but Joseph makes
even that a cause of woe and lamentation against the
Commonwealth.
Seventh Grievance : That “ an attempt is being made”
to send the N.S.W. patent records to Melbourne. They
haven’t been sent to Melbourne, and there is no such
attempt. Certainly an inquiry was made as to whether
the Sydney patent office, like some of the other offices,
kept its records in duplicate, so that one set could be
spared for the new Australian Patent Office —just now in
Melbourne but to be removed later on to the Federal
capital. The same inquiry was addressed to the other
States, for it is very little good having a central Patent
Office unless the patents of all Australia can be traced
there ; but, as usual, Carruthers was the only braying ass
who saw a horrible injury in the matter. The real posi-
tion now is that copies are being made of N.S.W. patent
records, and the copies will go to Melbourne, and after-
wards to the Federal capital.
Eighth Grievance : That the N.S.W. State Savings
Bank is no longer allowed to hang out in the Federal
Post Office at . Sydney. The business of the Post Office
had so increased under Federation that there was no
longer space for the Savings Bank, so a year or two ago
that institution found more roomy quarters elsewhere,
and saved the rent it had been paying to the Australian
Government. No one complained at the time, but
Joseph has just discovered that a great wrong was done.
Ninth Grievance : That the Australian Government
has its own auditors, instead of having its accounts
audited by N.S.W. State officials. Some auditing was
formerly done for it by N.S.W. State officials, but the
Federal Public Service Commissioner (a N.S.W. man)
decided to employ his own men instead of borrowing
the public servants of the State. Carruthers describes
this, if the Sydney Telegraph’s report is accurate,
as “turning these unfortunate officers and their
families into the streets.” The event only happened
a week before Carruthers made his complaint, but
apparently these N.S.W. State officials were already
starving for want of Federal employment. A day or two
later the S.M. Herald rather gave Joseph away over this
matter. It explained that when the Federal Government
decided on having its own auditors, it offered to take
over the State officials who had previously done the work
for it, and to make them Federal officials, and the Car-
rutiiers Government, which wept so bitterly about these
men having lost their job, had refused to let them be
taken over so that they could continue in the job.
Tenth Grievance : That the High Court, composed of
three Judg-es (two of them from N.S.W.), has decided that
Federal officials are not liable to pay income-tax on their
Federal' salaries to the State Government. This hits
every State which has an income-tax, but, as usual, Car-
ruthers is the only Premier who is bellowing with grief
about it.
Eleventh Grievance: That N.S.W. is charged more
than its share for “ new works ” undertaken by the Aus-
tralian Government. In a sense, this is correct —also,
Victoria is charged more than its share, and is even a
heavier loser than N.S.W. The money comes from all the
States, but the works (mostly new post-offices and tele-
graphs) are only put up where they are wanted.
As Victoria and N.S.W. are already pretty well
supplied with these necessaries, a large propor-
tion of the money is being spent in WeStralia,
which is ill supplied. When the present temporary
financial arrangement ends and the postal accounts
are lumped together, N.S.W. and Victoria will begin to
get some of the profits of this extra Westralian expendi-
ture, and thing's will be equal, but in the meantime they
both lose a few thousands, though only Carruthers is
weeping over it. It was George Reid, of N.S.W., who,
when Federal Premier, started the present system which
Carruthers laments over —the one under which N.S.W.
and Victoria lose a trifle —but Joseph prefers to regard it
as a horrible conspiracy of the other States against
N.S.W.
* # * *
On top of all this verbal and vociferous mullock
Joseph has, of course, his usual woe about the
Federal capital. It is a very complicated old woe
by this time. Ip the Genesis of the Federal
movement —or rather a little after the Genesis,
say about Deuteronomy—the people of N.S.W.
accepted a Federal Constitution —drawn up
by the people’s elected representatives. In
it there was no mention of any parti-
cular State as the site of the capital. By
an infamous breach of faith—the raising of the
minimum vote necessary to ensure acceptance
from 50,000 to 80,000 —which made the name
of the N.S.W. Parliament stink as that of the boss
liar and pledge-breaker of Australia, the people’s
acceptance was cancelled. Then George Reid,
of N.S.W., called the other Premiers together and
got a clause inserted that the Federal capital was
to be in N.S.W., 100 miles or any greater distance
from Sydney, and was to consist of 100 square
miles or any larger area, which area was to be
handed over by N.S.W. to the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth asked the N.S.W. State
Government for many months to suggest or offer
some possible sites, and the N.S.W. State Gover-
nment grumpily replied that it was none of its busi-
ness, and that the Commonwealth must hustle for
itself. Finally the State Government was per-
suaded to allow one of its own officials to report
on proposed sites, and it also reserved from sale
the State lands in the sites reported upon. That
was the nearest approach t j a definite offer that
could be procured. The Australian Parliament
selected one of the sites thus reserved—a site in a
locality highly recommended by the N.S.W. State
official" appointed to deal with the matter—and
now the State’s political insect, Carruthers,
declines to surrender it. He claims, by way of
four more woes and injuries
Twelfth Grievance : That the present N.S.W. Govern-
ment has a right—and this right hasn’t been sufficiently
recognised— to repudiate the acts of the previous State
Government which refused to interfere with the selection
of a site, and thus Carruitiers seeks to compel the Aus-
tralian Parliament to start the weary business all over
ao . a j n-
Grievance : That the site of the capital and
the area of the Federal territory should be decided solely
by the State Parliament of N.S.W., and that a bitter
wrong has arisen somewhere hereabouts The Australian
Parliament, and the other States, and the vast majonty
of the people are thus to have no voice in the selection of
their own capital. They were first tricked out of the
right to select a capital anywhere except in N.S. W., and
it is now proposed to trick them out of all rights of
selection whatsoever. Yet the Constitution says the seat
pL?iament nent “ S ‘ lall ** determ,ned ” by the et
Fourteenth Grievance : That there was a private
arrangement between George Reid and the other State
Premiers that the capital was to be at “a reasonable
distance ” from Sydney. E"en if this yarn is true, the
private and hidden arrangements arrived at by George
Reid and anv other State Premier, at a hole-and-corner
meeting, don’t affect the people of Australia in the least,
Probably the yarn isn’t so true as it might be. Certainly
Carruthers’ word isn’t sufficient security, and his assur-
ance that the Dalgety site isn't at a reasonable distance
from Sydney is worth very little. Carruthers’ wo. d is at
a discount just now, and his sudden discovery of alleged
hidden agreements, said to have been arrived at by irre-
sponsible persons five or six years ago, doesn’t necessarily
improve his reputation for accuracy'. Still this consti-
tutes another bruise to Joseph’s feelings.
Also, though it doesn’t seem to have been
specially mentioned this time,, there is always
standing in type
Fifteenth Grievance : That the Dalgety site should be
rejected in any case because it is nearer to Melbourne
than to Sydney. It isn’t nearer to Melbourne than to
Sydney, but that is a mere detail.
There was also a composite grievance about some small
Oustoms matters, but the Customs Department replies
that Joe’s statement about it doing certain work at a low
rate for the Melbourne Harbor Trust is not true ; that his
statement that it refused to do similar work for the
Sydney Harbor Trust is not true, and that all the rest of
the alleged grievance is pure delusion.
* * *
And now that Joseph Carruthers has done
all these wails—almost all of which are based on
gross misrepresentation, while the small balance
are the howls of a spoilt child that wants the
moon—and then hanged the door of Parliament
and gone home, the country waits to learn what
he is going to do about it. For a year Carru-
thicks has perpetrated the cuttle-fish act, and
diverted attention from N.S.W. Lands troubles,
and from other matters that badly want investi-
gation on his own premises, by throwing out an
inky and evil-smelling fluid at the Federal
legislature ; but even the cuttle-fish is expected to
do something more than merely remain for ever
i n one place and cuttle. So far as he has gone,
Carruthers has been a traitor to Australia, a
mean and petty individual who made his unclean
little political advertisement by seeking indirectly
to tear up the union and to fill a community of four
million people with malice, hatred, uncharitable-
ness and dissension ; and a politician who lias, in
the course of his anti-Federal campaign, been
howled out in so many inventions, misrepresenta-
tions and suppressions as should put a bagman to
shame and make a dealer in time-payment man-
gles blush. In a community with a cleaner and
healthier public feeling Car hut hers, instead of
being Premier of a State, would he unable to find
an electorate sufficiently stupid to return him
to Parliament. Now, if he doesn’t want to be a
hopelessly inefficient joke as well as a blot and a
disgrace, it is “ up to ” Joseph to act with some
energy. He is due to secede, or to start a revolu-
tion, or to take a referendum, or to appeal to the
British Parliament, or to hustle in some way.
Australia is waiting for Joseph to leave
off playing the nasty small hoy, and to
rise up and obliterate tilings. No doubt, if
lie does attempt a referendum of the State, tlie
questions that the public will he invited to
answer with a “yes” or a “no” will be such a
vast misstatement of the case that the popular
vote will amount to nothing—when the ballot-
paper asks tlie people to say whether they approve
of Deakin’s conduct in swindling N.S.W. out of
the capital and in executing the Six Hatters at
Dalgety, or something like that, very remarkable
results may he looked for. Still, though no one
expects Carruthers to go straight, it is reason-
able to expect that he will go somewhere.
TWEEDLE-DUM (AND DEE) IN BRITAIN.
Tiiere has been a change of Government in
Britain ; and the Australian papers are filled with
pictures of smug gentlemen who are Cabinet
Ministers, or who want to be Cabinet Ministers
and are now going to be Lords ; and with long
extracts from “Who’s Who ” about other gentle-
men who are going to occupy minor positions
in the new Administration, and are all
appallingly respectable (there is, seemingly,
not any savor of disreputableness in the
whole collection). And there is all this
laborious effort to mislead the public into the
idea that Something Has Happened. But nothing
has happened. Things are as they were. One
set of drifters has drifted out of the main current;
and the other set of drifters has come in from a
back eddy to represent a slow purposeless floating
around as “ progress,” and a position on top of the
fluctuating tide as “Government.” The names
of Ministers have changed, and that is all. In
policy nothing essential is different. The
Government that has gone out believed fiercely
that the Empire’s salvation depended on
having Chinese slaves in S’Africa. The
Government that has come in has its
doubts about that idea, but won’t interfere in the
matter, and at least is certain that the Empire’s
salvation is bound up with the free'entry of
Chinese, Japanese, Hindus, Russian Jews and
European proletariat into Britain —a policy about
which the outgoing Cabinet had some doubts. In
brief, the Conservative is rabid on having Chinese
for S ’Africa ; the Liberal is rabid on having them
for England, if they choose to come. The differ-
ence is hardly worth getting excited about,
though, from an Englishman’s point of view,
the Conservative policy is better, for it is—or
seems to be—to keep the objectionable alien out
of his own country and dump him into somebody
else’s country, after you have hit somebody else on
the head sufficiently hard to smother all protest.
One other small point of difference (which makes
itself visible by the fact that Balfour stressed it
in a farewell speech) between the Conservative
and the Liberal is that the former thought the
alliance with Japan so important that he
stayed in office with the pertinacity of a
thieving pig in a potato patch, swallowing all
sorts of insults, in order to bind the country
in unholy matrimony with the Asiatic for
10 years. The Liberal doesn’t think so much of
the alliance but will do nothing to disturb it, and,
as a sort of r'iahe-weight, to show that he is as
good a pro-Asiatic as the Conservative, he is
strenuous in his opposition to proposals (which the
Conservative is inclined to support) for keeping
British work for British workers by a tariff against
Asiatic and other cheap-labor products.
* * * *
An intelligent Japanese standing before the
ruins of humanity which infest London Bridge, and
ruminating sardonically on the means to hasten
the decay of the greatness before him, might be
pardoned for a long hesitation before making up
his mind as to which party was most deserving of
his sympathy and support. The Conservatives,
he would admit, were more effusive in their friend-
ship. The Liberals, he would have to conclude,
were a shade more practical since they viewed
with abhorrence any proposals to restrict alien
immigrants or alien manufactures. Probably, in
the end his vote would go to the Liberal, since
the Jap is an eminently practical man. As to the
intelligent British voter (whose existence must
be presumed, in spite of the weight of circum-
stantial evidence to the contrary) his perplexity
in deciding how to vote must be pitiable. There
is really nothing for him to vote upon unless he is
an Irishman, when he has the privilege of
choosing between the Home Rule professions of
the Liberals and the practical concessions of land
reform which he is able to wring out of the Con-
servatives. If he is Welsh, he can take some
interest in the question of Welsh dis-establish-
ment. In odd places some small local issues
relieve the tedium of politics. In some counties
the questions of the Eastern Position, and the
Rubric, and the passementerie on the clergyman’s
pinafore arouse great excitement. But there is
no essentially British issue, in voting on which the
intelligent British elector may find a hope of
practical reform.
Nor can the intelligent elector even buoy him-
self up with the idea that he can, by voting one
way or the other, make sure of efficient and intelli-
gent administration. Military administration is
an issue which is always much canvassed at
British elections. The last time the Liberals held
office they were kicked out summarily owing to
the discovery that they had so neglected the com-
monest military precautions as to allow the supply
of cordite to dwindle to vanishing point. The
Conservatives took office with a warrant to secure
Army reform at all hazards. They reformed the
army to a standard the height of which was con-
spicuously exhibited during the S’African war,
and, since that war, according to those best able to
judge, the army has, if anything, deteriorated.
Financial administration has always been a strong
point with English statesmen. The habit that
the country got into of fighting over “Ship-
Money ” and “ Supply ” and hinging its patriotism
on its tax payments, led to the growth of a keen
financial sense in politics, and in that respect
there is little to complain of in the peace ad-
ministration of the finances by either party,
though the balance is in favor of the
Liberals. But the very absence of the sins
and follies of extravagance so rife in Aus-
tralia deprive Finance of any supreme power
as an issue in British politics. The voter has to
choose between two parties, each of which spends
his taxes for him fairly well in times of peace,
muddles matters abominably in times of war, ami
believes in practically the same policy of drift and
stagnation. What he cannot vote for is a party
which will grapple boldly with the evils that are
sapping England’s greatness. There are any
numbers of suggestions from various sections
and parties to secure the welfare of “ the
colonies”; and there is a superfluity of decided
opinions as to the government of the
Balkans and the “ sphere of influence ”
in China and the like. What is conspicuously
lacking is an English party —an organisation to
rescue England for the Englishman and save it
from the foreign plutocrat, from the local land
monopolist, from the alien knocking at its gates,
and the alien goods bumping on its wharves. An
English party is really more needed in England
than an Australian party is needed here ; and that
is saying much.
* * * *
An English party—or, to put it more broadly, a
British party —would have as the main planks of
its platform the British land for the British
people, and the British market for the British
manufacturer. It would sweep out of existence
not only the huge aggregation of foreign
plutocrats who have squatted contemptuously on
Britain’s soil and made it their poultry-run and
their goat-pasture, but also the local wastrel, with
or without a title, who locks up good land which
should be breeding Britishers and reserves it fo.'
the use of pheasants and deer. It would put up a
stringent barrier against the pauper foreign immi-
grant, a barrier of total prohibition, sine ,
whilst Britain continues to export British
men and women, it can have no need for the
population refuse of other lands. It would
put up just as stringent a barrier against
•the pauper foreigner’s cheap goods, holding that
whilst British men were unemployed for Briti h
markets to be open to foreign comp tition
was a wrong to the nation. In addition to
these economic reforms, a British party would
insist on a self-respecting scheme of National
Defence, making it the duty of every man to assist
in the guarding of his country, and making un-
necessary any dependence on an Asiatic for
safety ; and would abolish the senseless House
of Lords and the unjust State subsidy of the
Anglican Church. Those are the main points
of reform needed in Great Britain as they
strike an outsider with no ingrained superstitions
in favor of established institutions, no idea
that because a thing is mouldy and ancient
it is therefore sacred. But the “insiders,” the
men who have to do the voting, seem to be so
grooved and ground into superstitious idolatry
of what is ancient, as to be blind to the possibili-
ties of a reformed England. The one man,
Chamberlain, with half an idea of the right
track is not included in either of the great
governing parties, and seems, with his half-an-
idea, to have been smothered under the fluff of
immemorial tradition and the shoddy of sanctified
precedent. It is a poor look-out for Britain.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Federal Capital.
Regarding the yarn that the Federal Parliamentis
willing to re consider its choice of a Federal capital
site, and, at the bullying of Joseph Carruthers,
sacrifice the interests of Australia to the rude
clamor of a small Sydney section, consider once
again, in chronological order, the various steps
in this Federal capital settlement
N.S.W., by an Enabling Act of its Parliament (Dec. 23,
1895), joined with the other States in constituting a
Federal Convention to draw up a Constitution, to be
submitted to a Referendum, stipulating that 50,000
affirmative votes should be necessary V> carry assent to
the Constitution. \ , , ... ,
The Federal Convention was elected Y>n sa h ( Marc “
and April, 1897) and drafted a Constitute 11 which pro-


vided, among other things, that the Federal capital
should be within Federal territory, and chosen by the
Federal legislature. A proposal at the 1891 Convention
was made that the Constitution should fix a site
at Sydney, and was defeated by 26 votes to 4 Georgb
Dibbs being the only N.S.W. member to vote for it. At
this 1895 Convention a proposal that the capital should be
fixed in Sydney was unanimously scouted. Lyne’s mo-
tion to provide that the site must be in N.S. Wales was
defeated by 33 votes to 5. .
In Dec., 1897, the N.S. Wales Parliament, breaking faith
with the other States, amended its Enabling Act and
altered the minimum effective vote necessary to secure
acceptance of the Federal Constitution from 50,000 to
80,000. „
In June, 1898, a Referendum was taken on the Constitu-
tion, and the N.S. Wales vote was 71,595 for, and 66,228
against. The vote thus fulfilled the conditions for
acceptance of the 1895 Enabling Act, but not of the 1897
breach-of-faith Amending Act.
George Reid of N.S.W. suggested a Conference of Pre-
miers to meet the situation resulting from this breach of
faith. At this conference it was agreed, in deference to the
clamor of the Sydney provincialists, to so amend the Consti-
tution that the Federal capital must be in N.S. W., must be
at least 100 miles from Sydney, and must be within an
area of Federal territory not less than 100 square miles in
extent. With these changes, the Federal Constitution
was accepted in N.S. W. by 107,420 votes to 82,741 (June
20, 1899).
The Australian Government, prompt to put in action
the Federal machinery, suggested to the N.S.W. Govern-
ment to offer a site, or a selection of sites, for the Federal
capital. The N.S.W. Government refused to offer a par-
ticular site. After some pressing, it appointed a Royal
Commission to report on various proposed sites, and
agreed to offer a choice of sites.
The N.S.W. Royal Commission recommended as the
very best site one in Southern Monaro, within 20 miles of
the site now proposed at Dalgety. In accordance with
an Australian Government request, the N.S.W. Govern-
ment agreed to reserve from alienation all Crown lands
around Dalgety, Bombala, and other proposed sites.
After lengthy consideration the Australian Parliament
picked upon Dalgety as the best possible site, and by an
Act chose that.
The N.S.W. Government then withdrew its offer of the
Dalgety site, threw' mud at the report of its own Royal
Commission, and Joseph Carruthers shrieked “ Federal
tyranny ” (Kosciusko stayed just where it was before).
To some Bulletin readers this recital, for the
manyth time, of very well-known facts may suggest
weariness. But there is nothing like a precise fact
to bump against impudent bluff. Joseph Carru-
thers’ shrieks represent a most impudent bluff.
He is anxious to call attention from his own
political misdeeds by yelling false accusations
against the Federation. In Sydney he has some
sort of following, and people have stopped talking
about the Lands scandals to admire Joseph in his
new rdle of Federal accuser. (It’s a refreshing
change for Joseph to be the accuser.) But it is
not likely that N.S.W. will be gulled into follow-
ing the lead of the Sydney shriekers, whose ideas
of Australia are bounded by Woolloomooloo,
Surry Hills, and the Abattoirs. It is even more
unlikely that the people of Australia will be turned
from their will by the poor tricks of the Bad Boy
of politics.
-
A Referendum re Secession.
After N.S.W. State Premier Carruthers pushed
through his hazy resolutions re taking a referen-
dum about something not very clearly defined,
there was a small faint eruption of letters in
Sydney Telegraph. Only one of them, however,
was really interesting; the writer went bald-
headed for a referendum on the subject of seces-
sion, and foamed at the brain with a bogus
patriotic frenzy till the top of his head was barely
visible above the froth of his own exuberance.
All the same, and despite his frenzy, there was at
least something definite about this gentleman. A
referendum on the subject of secession wouldn’t
lead to anything, but it would be an amusing re-
creation, and if it were taken fairly, and fully, and
honestly, it would supply some interesting read-
ing. But to supply any information worth having
it must be taken on all the aspects of secession—-
not merely on Joey Carruthers’ pet aspect.
The Bulletin suggests that the vote be taken
separately, and counted separately, in each State
electorate, and that the ballot paper should read
as follows:
0) Co you believe that New South Wales should secede
from the British empire ?
(2) Do you believe that New South Wales should secede
from the Commonwealth ?
(3) Do you believe, supposing New South Wales secedes
from the Commonwealth, that your electorate should
secede from New South Wales and remain in the Common-
wealth, either as part of a new State, or by annexation to
one of the existing States?
If that vote were taken at a General Election so
as to secure a heavy poll, or taken separately
under an Act which made voting compulsory, the
results would be something to look back upon.
But it would be highly advisable to pass an Act
making voting compulsory. Otherwise the public
would probably take Joe’s grievance as a joke,
and mostly stay away, while many of those who
voted would scrawl ribald remarks like “My
Oath,” or “ Mine’s a Beer, ” on the ballot-paper,
and thus bring J oseph into mockery and derision.
Westralia’s Shocking Treasurer.
Westralia had a general election the other day,
and encouraged Rason ; and Rason responds to
the encouragement in this noble fashion
He estimated that the deficit at the end of the present
year would be £132,851. . . He was not prepared to
impose further taxation than that previously outlined. . .
He would not make lengthy reference to further borrow-
ing, but it was apparent that many works hitherto under-
taken solely from revenue would have to be built out of
loans.
And Westralia almost deserves it, because Rason
told the people before the elections that that was
the sort of shiftless person he was. “What is
thereto be afraid of?” he asks. In June, 1900,
the debt was £63 10s. lid. per head ; in June last,
five years later, it stood at only £61195. lid. per
head. That showed “a healthy condition of
affairs not equalled or even approached by any
other Australian State.” And the State, which
apparently swallows that kind of logic, doesn’t
take into account the fact that in 1900 the popu-
lation was 173,000, and in June, 1905, it was
250,433, and that by far the greater number of the
arrivals meantime have been women and children —
the families of men who rushed over in the
early days. If Rason pawned his house for
£127 Is. lOd. when he got married ; and then, on
Rason junior’s arrival, decided that the household
was only pawned to tne extent of £42 7s. 3id. per
head instead of £63 10s. lid. per head as before,
wherefore he was justified in going out and bor-
rowing another £2l 3s. 7d. to even matters up ;
and if on the arrival of every succeeding Rason
he celebrated the event by putting the house-
vi ,^ urt^er into pawn, Rason would prob-
ably be a very tired man by the time he found out
that, though the arrivals reduced the debt per
head, they didn’t make it any easier to pay the
interest bill. And that is Westralia’s position
exactly- Rason finds another reason, however,
why Westralia should make even less attempt in
the future than it has made in the past to
pay its way. The net debt is £16,968,929, and
the amount of loan money spent on more or less
directly reproductive works is £16,166,000.” What
he doesn’t mention is the amount which has been
squandered on mining fields whose life is strictly
limited. Large sums have been spent on public
buildings ir districts which have already been
abandoned. Railways have been laid to other
districts where no mining is now being done.
When the money was borrowed for these works,
their true character was more or less recognised,
and sinking funds were provided for. Yet the
Auditor-General said in his last report
As far as I am aware, with the exception of one year, up
to the present no provision has been made in the railway
accounts for the contribution to the sinking fund neces-
sary under the Loan Acts.
As to the goldfields water scheme, in which
another huge slice of loans was sunk, even Big-
john Forrest recognised that it was only the
honest thing to make it pay for itself within about
30 years. The term was too long certainly ; for al-
ready we have the Lake View Consols, one of
the greatest of the Kalgoorlie mines, admitting
that it has about got to the end of its tether,
wherefore it has bought mines elsewhere, and is
preparing to scuttle out of Westralia, leaving the
expensive water scheme and its share of the debt
behind. “ The actual loss on the water scheme, ’
Rason said in his Budget speech, “ was £13,000;
but it had been calculated that the mining indus-
try benefited by the scheme to the extent of
£300,000 annually.” In plain English, Rason
allows the foreign mine-owner, who will presently
pack up and clear, leaving only a hole in the
ground—Rason allows him to make £300,000 a
year out of a scheme which is costing the State
£13,000 a year to run, and which will presently be
thrown back oh the hands of the taxpayers, use-
less and worn-out, yet loaded with an annual
interest charge of £90,000. When Parliament
authorised this work, and when Cohen lent the
money for it, a sinking fund was expressly pro-
vided for. Not only has not a penny of sinking
fund ever been earned, but the State has ac-
tually subsidised the undertaking to the extent
of £13,000 a year ; and Rason, who is supposed to
watch the financial interests of the people, cheer-
fully announces that absentee capitalists are suck-
ing £300,000 a year out of the business—in fact, lie
seems proud of it, just as he seems proud of his
expected £130,000 deficit. And, as he can’t be
just to the State and generous to the absentee
capitalist at the same time, he decides to be gene-
rous to the absentee and unjust to the State. The
absentee shall have his present of £300,000 a year;
if the State wants anything for itself, well, it can
go and pawn itself to get it.
A Commission of Inquiry.
What was Judge Rogers appointed to the N.S. W.
Railways coal-contracts Commission for.? He
hadn’t been sitting three hours before his conduct
raised the question. Holman, M.L.A., whose
speech in the Assembly led to the appointment of
the Commission, had made an incidental reference
to large investments in mortgages made during the
past year or two by a chief Railways officer. The
first witness was asked whether he had given the
information to Holman ; when he said he hadn’t,
Rogers broke out
Then I understand that some sneak goes to some
member of Parliament, who has a special search into
people’s private affairs. I never saw a much more dis-
graceful thing. I want to get at the root of this matter.
Ido not know whether we have the proper man. When
we have we will deal with him, unless there is ground for
his action.
Later on he said he “ took a very strong view of
this sort of thing.” No evidence had been given
one way or the other when he took this “strong
view ” ; yet the man who was supposed to be
making a judicial inquiry sprang out on the
threshold to denounce “some sneak” who had
searched into “people’s private affairs”; and
the calm, judicial person promised to “ deal with
him ” when he found out who he was, unless there
was ground for his action. Presumably, if Judge
Rogers had been inquiring into the N.S.W.
Lands scandals, he would have had the same
“very strong view” about “sneaks” who searched
into “people’s private affairs”—land agents’
affairs included ; and His Honor’s opinion
of Justice Owen, who ordered precisely
the same sort of information to be got
regarding two or three people, is doubtless too
deep for words. But Judge Rogers, who
rushed out to resent an imputation against a rail-
way officer, and took such a “ very strong view of
this sort of thing ” before any evidence had been
given about it, and before the imputation
against the officer had been withdrawn, took
a curiously mild view of very much the same
sort of thing when it was referred to at
the very same sitting. One of the Western
mine-owners, who had tendered coal at a much
lower price than the combine’s price, said
that the combine, or a member of the combine,
had previously offered him £lOOO to shut up his
mine—that is, not to tender. The matter appears
to be of enormous importance; it has a most direct
bearing upon the morals and methods of the com-
bine ; and as the combine supplies the public’s
railways with coal, it has also a direct bearing on
the public interest. It was practically a sugges-
tion that there was a systematic attempt to pre-
vent the Railways getting cheap coal. Yet Judge
Rogers evidently had no use for evidence about
“ this sort of thing” :
Mr. Broomfield : May I ask a question about this offer
of if 1000 ?
The Chairman : I do not think it matters.
Fortunately, Judge Rogers does not sit alone.
E. W. Knox, in the front ranlc of Sydney’s com-
mercial men, is with him, as well as the Chairman
of the Public Service Board. Knox, in a per-
fectly proper way, remarked, after certain evi-
dence had been given, that he thought “a prima
facie case had been made out that the best contract
had not been made.” Whereupon, attention
having been drawn to the remark—
The Chairman : It is.a great pity it was reported. . . .
I am quite sure none of the Royal Commissioners have
come to any conclusion at all, or holds any strong views
whatever.
Wherein Judge Rogers forgot his own “very
strong views.” Somebody digs up evidence which
might suggest corruption in the department; and
he is called a “sneak,” and the chairman
threatens to “deal with him” under certain
circumstances. When a Commissioner expresses
the opinion that there is a prima facie case to
answer, the chairman says “it is a great pity it
was reported.” When counsel proposes to ask
about the coal combine’s alleged bribes, the chair-
man silences him with, “I do not think it
matters.” Again, then, what was Judge Rogers
appointed for? Or what does he think he was
appointed for ?

The Maoriland Elections.
From an Australian point of view the most inter-
esting feature of the Maoriland elections was the
vote on the liquor traffic. A year or two ago it
seemed as if Maoriland were about to try the
experiment of absolute prohibition of alcoholic
liquor. To Australia such a decision would have
been of some value—equivalent, in effect, to “ try-
ing it on the dog” a thing of doubtful wholesome-
ness. The hope—many Australians were selfish
enough to entertain the hope—that the sturdy
islanders would chart out a clear path for us on the
liquor problem seems now to be vain. Maoriland
has barely tasted prohibition—partial, and neces-
sarily therefore ineffective, prohibition in one or
two districts is as far as the experiment has yet
gone —and is inclined already to go back on its
steps, and refuse to show to the white world if it
is really possible for a civilised community to lead
a beerless life and be moderately happy withal.
A sip and the taste for no license seems to fail.
Premier Seddon’s great personal triumph is also in
a fashion a set-back to the Prohibition cause,
for it was Skddon who cruelly pinned the party
down to the point, “No pubs., no private flasks
in the family cupboard.” He proposed that if it
were to be Prohibition it must be genuine Prohi-
bition, with not only no sale but also no consump-
tion of liquor, and the Cold Water folk—who
seem to secretly hanker after a little whisky on
the quiet—didn’t like the issue when it was put
that way. As to Seddon’s party triumph, there
is no shadow of a doubt. The Opposition has
been almost wiped out and King Dick left as
despotic monarch of the new Parliament. Evi-
dently the country thoroughly endorses the
socialistic legislation by which he has
abolished the sweater and the land mono-
polist and made Maoriland the Paradise of
the “small man.” In only one point is Seddon's
policy weak—finance; and that is a point on
which, judging by recent events, The Bulletin
almost despairs of rousing an enlightened public
opinion. A great many of the blessings which
the Seddon Administration showers on Maoriland
are bought with borrowed money. They represent
the extra rasher of bacon for breakfast which is
got by pawning the axe, and the plum-pudding
paid for out of the amount Cohen lent on the
drawing-room piano. Side by side with a
progressive policy of High Protection, adequate
anti-sweating laws, and fairly stiff land taxation
which is probably unmatched in the world for its
scientific encouragement of industry, Seddon
carries on an extravagant borrowing system,
which must in time canker away all those benefits,
The rule of Seddon is benevolent. Mortgagee
rule would be a very different matter; under it
the era of high wages and easily accessible land
would very soon be swept away. And to the
rule by the mortgagee Maoriland is steadily
drifting’. Its borrowing rate is a sheer madness
which must, if persisted in, bring disaster. But
the disaster will not have to be faced by Richird
Skddon, and so he does not care, Mor will it
have to be faced by the majority of the voters of
the present generation ; and so they, seemingly,
do not care. They are content to have a good
time for themselves, and to leave it to their
children to face Cohen and the foreclosure.

Remember the Sabbath Day to Flog
thy Nigger Thereon.
Piano-manufacturer Beale, of Sydney, met an
Englishman, a many years resident of South
Africa, on the San Francisco boat, and extracted
from him these particulars. In South Africa the
British authorities, who were so deeply shocked
at Australia’s immigration laws, impose
restrictions of many kinds against immigrants, and even
agents. For instance, a commercial traveller from abroad
must pay £25 cash down for a license to travel in each of
the four South African colonies. For a whole year he
may compound for the four by a payment of £75. Beyond
that, the full £lOO. This applies to all travellers, British
or foreign. (In Portuguese territory they are free.)
Moreover they are subject, and often subjected, to per-
sonal examination. Recently, before I left, a Hebrew
gentleman had jewellery to the value of £6OOO seized
and confiscated. Hence the examination. Third-class
passengers are required to deposit £2O in London, and
any others that the company may doubt. At Capetown
undesirables are rejected, and no reasons are given. This
appears to make chiefly against pro-Boers and British
labor. No one can go to the Transvaal without mil tary
permit, which makes chiefly against foreigners. Chinese
may land, for business purposes, if possessing £2OO in
cash. Hindoos may land without restriction. But
Hindoos are not admitted to the Transvaal or Orange
River Colony.
When we proposed to exclude Britain’s nigger,
Bull, the boss hypocrite of the globe, told us
that no distinction could be allowed between the
black and the white subjects of the blessed
empire. And the Transvaal and Orange State,
under direct British rule, draw the distinction in
a most emphatic manner. Again, about the com-
parative value of a white British subject and a
Chinaman :
It is quite true that many Australians and other British
who fought through the war, as well as others of them
who have arrived since, are in complete destitution, alto-
gether excluded from any chance of work or legitimate
occupation, but given a pittance of one shilling a day to
do nominal work, and, of course, very much worse fed
than the Chinese. Ido not think it true that rations
refused by the Chinese were given to the British people,
for all the supplies for the Chinese are bought and im-
ported in bulk under contract. But, as you say, some of
these supplies were quite likely rejected, and thus were
fed to the indigent British.
The white Briton fought to conquer the Transvaal
in order, he was told, that the British inhabitants
thereof might be freed from oppression. And
now the Transvaal is owned by German Jews and
overrun by Chinamen, and the white Briton,
knocked out of his job and refused a chance of
work, is a pauper worse fed than the China-
man. Finally, consider this picture of the British
Sunday at Jo’burg, and the treatment of the black
British subject there—the Kaffir about whose
alleged harsh usage under Boer rule J. Bull used
to weep tears of blood :
After a while the Chinese became mutinous, three
murders were committed at once, so the Governor inter-
fered, and ordered the floggings to cease. One China-
man, with a mate, must drill 12 inches in a day by hand,
mostly roof work. Under the same conditions, a Kaffir
will do 15 to 18 inches. Therefore, when the Chinese fell
short of the smaller task the trouble began. The Kaffirs
are still flogged with the sjambok. The whip is made of
rhinoceros or hippo, hide, either will do. No ;it is not
made square, just a round thong. Cut the flesh ? Why,
yes ; deeply, and never less than 25 lashes are given.
Who does the flogging ? Always a man of another tribe,
for they will not flog one another ; and then, being an
enemy, the flagellator does not miss a blow, but gives it
for all he is worth. He only hits in the same place after
the flesh has been thoroughly cut up all over. When
finished, the back is in a fearful state, raw' meat and
blood, but it heals wonderfully quickly with the Kaffirs.
Some make nO murmur, others scream incessantly under
the torture. They have two days’ holiday, and go to
work again. This punishment is often inflicted for a very
trivial fault or neglect.
“What day is usually devoted to this flogging
business?”
“ SUNDAY.”
South Africa is being rapidly Christianised. The
Kaffir already remembers the Sabbath. He knows
when it comes round by the horrible condition of
his back. The Chinaman isn’t flogged so much
because he retaliates by committing murder. And
the Chinaman—“ that splendid worker ”as Bruce
Smith called him—does far less work, it seems,
than the Kaffir, as well as committing far more
butchery. Yet he was allegedly imported because
the Kaffir didn’t do enough work. What a tangle
it all is, and how much flogging is needed to sort
it out.

The Resurrection of the Fish.
Sydney Telegraph is something extra in the way
of a hypocrite. After applauding the Agents-
General when they remark that it would pay
Australia to drop the Stinking Fish business, it
proceeds to sneak in the very Stinking Fish yelps
that they say do all the harm :
In 1885 N.S. W. stocks topped Canada on the London
market. Even up to 1900 we kept pace with Canada very
closely. But with 1901 came Federation, the Arbitration
Court, and then labor domination, and the result is that
our 3 per cents, are quoted 13J per cent, below those of
Canada.
And it then drags in over again “ labor-socialism,
the contract-labor clause, exclusion of colored labor
from the mail contract, and similar incidents ”
—the Six Hatters and the Petriana perjury
being understood—all hauled in by their decaying
fins to help the Telegraph through with its
dirty case. Between 1900 and the end of 1905, it
says, N.S.W. per cents, fell from 104 to 98 and
3 per cents, from 99 to 85—due to “Federation,
the Arbitration Court, and Labor domination.”
What it doesn’t mention is that, within the same
five years, British Consols also fell from 106 to 88.
At the worst the N.S.W. stock fell 14 points;
British Consols fell 18 points. Presumably that
was “Federation, the Arbitration Court, and
Labor domination” too ! N.S. Wales’stock hasn’t
therefore fallen as much as British Consols ; and
as British Consols obviously haven’t been affected
by “Federation, Arbitration Court, and Labor
domination,” it is a fair thing to assume tljat
N.S.W. stocks haven’t been affected either. In
fact, if they have been affected at all it ha 3
apparently been to strengthen and support them,
seeing that they haven’t fallen as much as Consols.
Seriously, what sort of oil ought an alleged
Australian paper like the Sydney Telegraph to
be boiled in—an alleged Australian paper which
noses round in any ash-barrel to find something
particularly dirty and putrid to throw at the coun-
try which keeps it in fatness?'

Rc-Ent( r William M'Millan.
Another man'on the situation :
William M’Millan, after a brilliant flash of silence has
broken out again with an interview on Carruihers’
infantile squeak about the “grievances” of the poor old
Ma State. As might have been expected, he seems to
approve of the lamentable performance. He says that
“ the question in its various phases is too big for an inter-
view.” The fact is that the question in its various phases
is too big for the mind of William M’Millan— a mind
which seems to be capable of evolving nothing but
priggish platitudes on every subject to which it is applied.
M‘Millan’s contribution to the discussion consists chiefly
of long-winded and meaningless sentences to the effect
that the capital question “demands broad-minded and
A Prayer in Time of Defeat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The House of Representatives opens its proceedings with
prayer. It is suggested that—to avoid the apparent blas-
phemy of prayer followed by the Opposition’s envious
insult of the party which has committed the crimes of
being Australian, National, and Protectionist, and is
guilty of the unforgiveable offence of being in power—
the Opposition should have a prayer all to itself, some-
what as follows :
O Lord, we pray Thee wake ! Arise !
The devil’s Deacon and his line
Deploy in might before our eyes,
And spoil our taste for ginger wine.
By Hatters’ lie and Lascar myth
We seek our envious spite to feed ;
For sounding brass is Pumpkin Smith,
And out of power is G. H. Reid.
We love the world —such Christians we—
The world that’s cheap and all its goods ;
We let the aliens’ work in free,
And love all other nationhoods ;
Freetrade in sects alone we bar—
(Australia’s very close to Rome) —
Give us cheap shoddy fiom afar,
And send us bishops out from ’Ome.
We love all men—such Christians we—
(All men who not Australians are);
Old hates we love to hold in fee,
And long-dead feuds we will not bar ;
The sweated aliens’ gcods we love,
The old world hates, across the sea
We bring, with shoddy boot and glove,
And “ The Boyne Water,” duty free.
Remember, Lord, our Joseph Cook
Who bites the hand that once did feed ;
Oh ! write him in Thy Doomsday Book,
A man upon the side of greed.
Remember how You treated Noe
Who digged and drank a winery—
If Laborites all go below
Be kind to William Henry Lee.
O Lord, be good to Pumpkin Smith —
Who dresses, rouges, makes up Reid ;
Be good to Bruce —who made that myth
Of British shipwrecked nigs who bleed
LTpon our coast cast up by wreck
(Like to the whale from Jonah’s belly).
Pour oil ! O Lord, upon the neck
And motor of sweet Willie Kelly.
Be good to Fysh —he’s cold and wan,
And, like us all, sees office not;
Look kindly upon Cameron
(In this, we know, we ask a lot).
For Generalissimo McCay ;
Lord ! he is not.like other men,
So let him have another day,
On which he yet may rat again.
And Robinson, and Skene, and Gibb,
Lonsdale and Liddell and the rest;
Wilson and Johnson, faithless, glib,
And all of our Lefthanded'Blest.
Give to our fees Thy righteous raps—
Ere our sectarian Logey busts ;
Give to Bill Lyne Thy knocks and slaps ;
And 0, we pray, he good to Trusts 1
The Harpers harp at duty’s call;
The rivers’ songs the Chanter sings;
Help us, 0 Lord, to howl and bawl;
Poison our insults and our stings !
The other side is steeped in sin,
And, to Thee, but one Christian owes ;
Help us, O Lord, to bring him in—
(Dividing the portfolios).
The Quick is dead —but we, 0 Lord !
Are living still—(You hear us yell ?
All night and day we screamed and roared
And bellowed for the quorum bell.)
Give office unto us, O Lord !
Send o’er the seas the German silks;
And look not cross-eyed, cold, or bored
Upon dear William Henry Wilks.

liberal treatment ” ; that the “ broad equities of the situa-
tion should be kept entirely in the foreground of the dis-
cussion ”; that “mutual susceptibilities must be care-
fully studied ” ; and that a “ widespread public opinion
should be evoked, which will insist on hurling- out of
political life the members who have failed to do their duty
to the people of this State.” As long as M’Millan sticks
to these Pecksniffian maxims, he is on safe ground.
Nobody can contradict them, and nobody wants to.
As soon, however, as this lofty-minded gentleman
condescends to discuss the facts about which his opinion
was asked, he shows all the provincial bias of an ordinary
man, who doesn’t care a hang about “ broad equities ” or
“mutual susceptibilities,” and whose only notion of
Federation is that it is a new piece of machinery designed
to grab something for N.S.W. in general, and Sydney in
particular. “It was always felt,” he says, “that no
federation could be effective without N.S.W.” It is quite
clear that this was always felt—by N.S.W. ; but there is
no evidence that it was always felt by the rest of Aus-
tralia. Even if it was, it is now beginning to be felt, and
not without reason, that no federation can be effective
with N.S.W. So far, all that the Federation has to thank
N.S.W. for is a long-sustained bellow about imaginary
“grievances,” and a gang of members in the Parliament
whose sole object has been to obstruct, in the most offen-
sive way possible, every attempt at useful legislation. If
N.S.W. is never going to contribute anything to the
politics of Australia but the snarls of J. Cook, the ill-
mannered garrulity of Kelly, the senseless babble of
Wilks, and the ponderous stupidity of Sydney Smith, it
may become a question whether the Commonwealth
won’t have to secede from N.S.W. in order to make itself
“ effective.”
M‘Millan’, s provincialism shows itself again when, after
an extended excursion into the regions of platitude, he
comes back to his subject, and talks about the meaning
of the Capital clause in the Constitution. Was it not
clearly meant, he says, “that, outside the 100-mile limit,
in the selection of a site the views of N.S.W. were to be
considered as paramount, provided the selected site was
reasonably convenient for members travelling from the
different States, and fulfilled all the conditions of a healthy
domicile ” ? In other (and much more intelligible) words,
was it not meant that N.S.W. should have the right to
select the site, provided only that it must be healthy and
convenient? If William M'Millan wants an answer to
his question, it is simply this—that nothing of the sort
was meant, nor could possibly have been meant, by the
words used. The words are that “the seat of Govern-
ment . . . SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE PARLIAMENT, and
shall be within territory which shall have been granted to
or acquired by the Commonwealth,” &c. Those words are
just about as capable of meaning what M ‘Mill an says
they mean as they are of meaning that the site shall be
selected by the Mikado, provided it is surrounded by a
whitewashed fence and is covered with blue grass. If the
Constitution meant that the capital site should be selected
by N.S.W., why in the name of all that is intelligent did
it say that the site should be determined by the Parlia-
ment of the Commonwealth ? The only right lhat
N.S.W. has in the matter is the right to grant the
territory, or, if it won’t do that, the “right” to have it
compulsorily taken. If Prime Minister Deakin has any
backbone, N.S.W. will have a chance of enjoying the last-
mentioned “ right” before very long. If M'Millan had
confined himself to a complaint about the long delay in
introducing the necessary Bill to assume jurisdiction over
the selected territory, most people would have agreed
with him, although the Federal Government is not
primarily responsible even for this. Deakin’s mistake,
and the real ground for complaint, lies in his having
spent such a lot of useless time and trouble in arguing
with the pettifogging and shifty Premier of N.S.W.
The Session-end Rush.
The Vic. House of Rich Landlords had its usual
outburst at the end of the session, doing as much
alleged work in the last 24 hours as it had done in
the previous six months, and doing it very badly.
Bent was trying to finish up in a hurry, tossing
some Bills overboard and pushing others through
holus bolus, so the Landlords had to “review”
things at a glance or throw them out. They
started by tossing out unceremoniously the Chinese
Registration Bill, which proposed to compel the
furniture-making Chinamen, who have hitherto
defied the law, to register themselves, and
refused any new licenses to the law-breakers.
This went by 17 votes to 11, after the
usual remarks from Manifold. Embling and
Co. about “ persecuting our fellow subjects,” “un-
Britisli and un-Christian legislation ” and so
forth. This action appeased the Landlords some-
what, and thereafter they contented themselves
with amending every measure almost out of
shape and throwing it back to the Assembly with
the implied threat, “take it or leave it.” Bent
lost his temper after awhile—what little he has of
it—and talked about a conference, going so far as
to name the managers, and as that meant another
two or three days added to the session the Rich
Landlords gave way somewhat, for they hate
work above all things. The Pure Food Bill
was altered by reducing the number of sam-
ples each municipality must submit for
analysis from 10 per 1000 of the population to two
per 1000, a percentage so low as to be almost farci-
cal ; and by stipulating that samples of goods
seized must be sent to the manufacturer as well as
to the consignor. Adulteration or false description
was made punishable only when the article was
sold to the prejudice of the purchaser; and,
finally, the Food Standards Committee was
enlarged by the addition of two representatives of
manufactures and two of commerce. This last
amendment was so “strong” that the Assem-
bly returned the Bill in disgust with the remark
that it had already accepted 36 of the Coun-
cil’s suggestions and would take no more, and the
House of Landlords could take the responsibility
of throwing out the measure. The obstructives
caved in, by 13 votes to 12. Then they threw out
of the Geelong Harbor Bill the provision for a 7s.
minimum-wage, whereupon Bent grew angry and
promised to fix the 7s. by regulation if he couldn’t
do it by law. After damaging the Amending
Factories and Shops Act and mangling the Agri-
cultural Colleges and Teachers Bills, the Land-
lords tackled the Milk Supervision Bill again and
insisted once more on their absurd Advisory
Board proposal. This the Lower House again
rejected. After the Sabbath rest, the Men
of Property met once more in a worse temper
than ever. They were bustled into giving
up their Advisory Board fad by the alternative of
throwing out the Bill altogether. Then five out
of the seven extra-obstructionists, when the
Tobacco Bill came on, tramped out of the
Chamber, leaving no quorum, and the House
was counted out, whilst Bent, in “ another
place,” was still trying to put his Small Holdings
Bill through. That last week is almost always
a choice commentary on legislation. For weeks
members—Fat members especially—sit for two or
three hours a week and do little or nothing ; then
the “ Houses of Review ” hack, hew, rush, bluff,
bellow and compromise over important matters,
and after about 24 hours’ real, steady graft, fall
down exhausted and let everything rip, or throw
everything out. And Australia keeps six Upper
Houses perpetrating nothing else but this sort of
farce !

An intricate tale :
The Vic. Police Commission is gathering little solid infor-
mation, but of late it has garnered a healthy crop of com-
plications, plain and colored. First, Detective Fryer
alleged that on a tram-car, in Bourke-street, he heard
theatrical entrepreneur Musgrove tell Detective Christie
that a certain person had taken him down for £3500, and
that he had got £3OOO back, of which he gave 10 per cent,
to the two Macs. —meaning thereby McManamny, of
Melbourne, and McLean, of Sydney. Detective Dungey
also said that both Fryer and Christie told him (Dun-
gey) this. Inspector Beck likewise said that Christie
told him (Beck) about it. Then Musgrove came
along, and swore that he never had any such
conversation with Christie, and that if he ever
lost any such sum, or got any back—he declined
to say whether he actually did or not —he never
gave 10 per cent, or any other sum to the two Macs, or
anybody else. Next, Christie arrived and alleged that he
did have a conversation with Musgrove, on a tram, about
the £3500 and the £3OOO recovered, but no bribe of 10
per cent, was mentioned. Also he said that he never
told either Dungey or Beck a word about the matter.
Here the Commission adjourned to get its wind and
sort things out. Next day a Mrs. Hogan, of St. Kilda,
announced that Detective Whitney had received £2B out
of £75 stolen from her and recovered by him. She
said straightly that she had handed Superintendent
Brown £8 to be divided among the four “demons” who
had a hand in the job, but that next day Whitney met
her at the Town Hall, and they had oysters and stout
together, and he then persuaded her to part an extra
£2o—the matter to be kept secret—for which £2O he gave
a receipt. Whitney then denied the whole circumstance
absolutely, especially the oysters and stout part of it.
He explained that the receipt was given at the
detective office overnight because Mrs. Hogan didn’t
wish to carry the money about with her, and
left it with him, but that, on returning it, he
forgot to get the receipt back. Detective Sexton
corroborated this, and Super. Brown showed that Mrs.
Hogan had apparently pondered the matter thoughtfully
for two whole years before she made a complaint. Brown
casually admitted that he had, during his career, accepted
private rewards of £lOO, £5O, £3O, and so forth, and “ had
thought nothing of it. He always reckoned he had justly
earned the rewards.” The Commission looked coldly at
Mrs. Hogan, but she was still a cocksure —and a very
angry—lady, so there was evidently nothing to be done
but swallow everything and adjourn once more. The
Commission is evidently expected to have the swallowing
capacity of a crocodile.

In its leading article of 15/12/’O5 the S.M. Herald
began with the statement: —
When Sydney gave up her pre-eminence as the practi-
cally free port in Australia as the price of Federation she
admittedly made a great sacrifice.
Then later on :
The figures show that the balance is decidedly in our
favor. During the first 11 months of the current year,
as was pointed out in our commercial columns yesterday,
the imports of the State have increased by £2,505,809, of
which £1,752,777 is explained as the increase from inter-
state sources. One item that may be isolated as an in-
stance of the beneficent freedom accruing to our carrying
trade is the increase of £200,000 on wool imported from
Queensland and transhipped from this port. ... Our
exports to other interstate centres have grown in almost
equal ratio with our imports, showing the firm
hold we have on the distributing trade. .. .
Our supremacy as a trade centre is in no real danger.
Strongly symptomatic of the thoroughly genuine char-
acter of our advance are the detailed figures, for these
show clearly enough that the success of the State is not
due to adventitious and sporadic circumstances, but that,
on the contrary, the gain is fairly evenly distributed over
every staple article of trade. While this remains true
we can perhaps afford not to take the little unpleasant-
nesses that arise from federalism in the making too
seriously ; THE ASSURANCE OF SUBSTANTIAL GAIN
that no political disabilities can destroy makes an effec-
tive set-off against many things that, no doubt, we
would much rather order differently.
In other words, after weeping its mechanical
stock tear over the commercial “ sacrifices ” which
N.S.W. “admittedly” made (who admitted it?)
for Federation, the Herald goes on to state that
there were no sacrifices at all, but a fine, large
profit and “ the assurance of substantial gain.”

The Deakin Government allowed so much of the
session to be wasted in obstruction before it shut
up Joe Cook’s howling mob by the closure that
comparatively little was done after all. The
saddest feature of the session was the hanging up
of the Anti-Trust Bill, merely on the ground that
members were tired, and wanted to go home ; and
the saddest part of this particular case was that it
was Labor-leader Watson —the Affable Watson ,
—who proposed leaving the matter over till next
session, and letting the Foreign Trusts ravage
industry for another six months or so.
The Anti-Trust Bill was not a new or wild or
experimental idea that required deep thought.
Joe Cook, who is always against Australian indus-
try, said it was, as a matter of course, but though
a thing may be correct even though Joe
Cook says it is, this wasn’t an instance
in point. It was much the same measure
as exists in Maoriland and in several States
of America, and was built on experience—not on
experiment. But a section of the Labor party
apparently didn’t see that the preservation or im-
provement of the Australian workman’s job was
any part of its business, and mere gratitude for
the assistance it had got in the matter of the Union
Label wasn’t a strong enough emotion to keep it
on the grind for a week or so longer. So the
Foreign Trust curse gets another six months’ lease
of life. But in this instance, it is pleasing to note,
Prime Minister Deakin wasn’t affable. He was
rather a victim of the lamentable affability of
Watson.

APPLIED ART.
From the dawn of humanity applied art has marched in
step with fine art, culminating in the great soul-efforts of
the Renaissance, when the love of the beautiful inspired
immortals like Michael Angelo to apply their art to other
than pictorial work, and there rose upon the sea of
human delight such wonders of applied aj t as the bronze
gates of Ghiberti, the colossal towers of Giotti, and the
masterpieces of such immortal craftsmen as Cellini,
Leonardo, and other great spirits, who shone in the en-
couragement applied art received in those davs. In these
modern days there is no need to look far for the appli-
cation of art to domestic decoration. We find it every-
where.—D.T.
Even Mrs. Cassidy may eclipse the bronze gates
of Chiberti by the adaptation of Patsy's working
tools to the adornment of the “ fr-ront room."

Every Sydney theatre without exception
has been busy crimping the tail of the cat, and
pinning something cheerful over the Window where
the Face has been, and across the keyhole where
the ear of the wicked has been listening to terrible
secrets throughout 1905. Recently a good deal of
gloom has been pervading the theatres —burglaries
and sermons at Her Majesty’s, divorce-courts at
the Royal, tea-meetings and tracts at the Lyceum,
Mephisto at the Tiv., silence and spiders at the
Palace, and tears and sad farewells at the Criterion.
The last days of this week are being devoted to the
good purpose of clearing out the spiders, wiping
up the crumbs of the stale bath-bun, mopping up
the tears, and making pipe-lights of the sermons.
“Leah Kleselma” will cease to burgle at Her
Majesty’s on Friday night; on Saturday Miss
Brune will farewell in “ Sunday ” ; Monday will
be a day of geese and goodfill; and on Tuesday
“The Girl from Kay’s” will frivol once more,
with Lauri where Huntley used to be. Wm.
Anderson at the Royal is doing something more
heroic ; it takes three days and two nights to wipe
out the blood, and the powder-smoke, and the
stains of divorce-court proceedings that have
accumulated during the year, so the house
will be closed for a couple of evenings before
it bursts out into a gorgeous pantomime
on Saturday night the first Christmas
panto. Sydney has had a chance to see for
some time. Edwin Geach has two theatres to
keep his eye upon—Thurston at the Palace, re-
opening on Saturday night; “ Two Little Vaga-
bonds,” opening at the Cri. on Boxing Night. As
usual, nowadays, Beatrice Holloway will be the
little vagabond who doesn’t want to be a black-
smith, and in the way of melodrama there aren’t
many better things. And, finally, at the Tivoli
the place of Leroy, Talma and Bosco will be taken
by “The Eight Primroses,” plucked lately by
Manager Rickards as they were a-blowing and
a-toeing at the London ’alls. This toeing is some-
thing extra —“ Danse des jambes en l’air,” the bill
calls it, jambes being French for what you can
cover with stockings.

Miss Nellie Stewart’s announcement that
her present season at Sydney Criterion is
good-bye-for-ever surrounds it and her with
a tender melancholy interest. The audience
is watching “Sweet Nell” with that look in
its collective eye that the girl he left behind
him wears when the liner with him on
board pulls up its gangways. A solemn morning
daily devotes a leader, a long one, with poetical
quotations, to the s übj ect of Miss Stewart’s intend ed
translation to the great American republic. It says
in effect that she shouldn’t because she’s so well
appreciated and supported here. And some of
her admirers are talking of forcibly stopping the
liegira—Nellienapping, in fact. It seems that
“ Sweet Nell of Old Drury ” has never been per-
formed in San Francisco or Chicago, and Miss
Stewart purposes to fill the wide void. It is a
fascinating piece—at least, Miss Stewart’s
acting and capital support make it so;
but the Commonwealth is just a little tired
of it. The Commonwealth knows the dia-
logue of all the characters off by heart, and
when the Commonwealth strides into its circle
stalls and gallery, to another and yet another
performance of the dog-carrying king and the
brilliant orange girl, it is solely because it hasn’t
sagged in its love for Miss Stewart. The Bulle-
tin wishes Sweet Nell of Young Australia all the
luck she deserves, and she deserves luck as long
and wide as the territory she is going to conquer.

In aid of the local Epileptic Colony an
amateur performance of Planquette’s “Rip Van
Winkle” came to passat Melbourne Princess’s
last Saturday night, and will continue to pass
until Friday of this week (D.V.). There are some
amateur shows that might be better, and others
that might be worse. “Rip Van Winkle ”at the
Princess’s is one of those others. The dainty
music gets tuneful treatment from orchestra,
chorus, and some of the principals, none of whom
have pretensions to lift the roof with his or her
upper register. The staging is more than good
enough, and the arduous name-part is played by
Edgar Marsden (a military lieutenant off the
boards) in a happy, unaffected manner. Although
he doesn’t put any force into the character, Mr.
Marsden conveys an idea of the Dutchman he
ought to be, singing in a sweet light tenor voice,
with good enunciation, and striking a faint note
of pathos when he returns from his 20 years’ sleep
as a hairy rheumatic ancient. Frank Wicks, as
Nick Veclder, is also a noticeably intelligent
actor, and the rest of the principals, bar one or
two, struggle through their tasks in a way that
almost merits forgiveness. All the same, they
can be advised to feel sorry for their mild in-
efficiency. Some of them forgot their lines on
Saturday, which enabled the prompter to throw
humorous sidelights on the dialogue, as it were,
and introduced an element of missing-word com-
petition into the tail-end of the protracted trouble.
But the story of “Rip” is not sufficiently
buoyant for an effective amateur performance.
It needs all the practised art of confident pros to
make it go happily, and the meagre audience that
samples the first attempt of the Arion Operatic
Society gave no indication of being overjoyed.
The epileptics of Victoria are not likely to get
luxuriously colonised on the proceeds of this six-
nights’ season under distinguished patronage.

On Saturday the Gilbert and Sullivan
Opera Co. will take up the running at Melbourne
Princess’s, with 10 operas of the G. and S. series
on its Christmas holiday programme. The cam-
paign opens in “Pinafore,” and Melbourne is
looking forward to the event.

At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), a revival
of “The Girl from Kay’s” was to end last night
(Wednesday), in order to leave the co. at liberty
for Theatrical Carnival purposes. “The Girl
from Kay’s” compared favorably and otherwise
with the previous performance of George Huntley
and co. Lauri gave only a tame, cramped imita-
tion of Huntley’s convincing Hoggenheimer;
whereas Miss Young was a more virile Winnie,
with more of the style of a girl who had been on
the stage than the mere crafty young milliner
that Madge Crichton presented. But, like the
other Winnie, she failed to rise to the stormy
occasion in the scene where her contempt
for Hoggie gets the better of her inten-
tion to punish his banking account. The
anger of a young woman who thinks she would
rather “chuck” her infatuated millionaire than
tolerate any more of his stupidity ought to be
tragically expressed. For the moment she is
willing to sacrifice her hopes of plunder rather
than smile upon her greasy captive. She ought
to seem to boil with chagrin. The charm of Miss
Delia Mason’s sugary little voice and ingenue
method were partly wanting in Miss Thomas,
whilst Miss Musgrove over - accentuated her
soubrette pertness as the lady’s maid, and Bantock
played the offensive old uncle in the crudest style.
On the other hand, this company scored freely as
variety artists. They could dance rings round the
people who played at the Princess’s a couple of
years ago. “ Max-ixe,” the interpolated dance by
Fred Leslie and Tilly Woodlock, will be remem-
bered as a delightful thing worked on the lines
laid down by Barney Fagan for himself and wife.

Her Majesty’s re-opens on Boxing Night
when Miss Tittell Brune and the J.C.W. Dramatic
Co. will introduce Mary Ann—“ Merely Mary
Ann ” —to Melbourne notice.
To-day (Thursday) the full strength of the
two Williamson musical companies will be em
ployed upon a Theatrical Charities Carnival at
Princes Court and Fitzgeralds’ Circus building.
George Lauri is honorary organiser of the mad
proceedings, and if this paragraph should meet
the eye of any Melbourne person who is not yet
aware of the widespread entertainment now in
progress, it may be the means of bringing one more
shilling to the fund.

tion to Christmas dinner. Bland’s bill-of-fare for

Melbourne Bijou is to be opened for

In place of the two circuses lately
departed, Melbourne is to have a more modern
form of entertainment under canvas. Bostock
and Wombwell, who state that their firm was
born 100 years ago, are coming from England and
elsewhere with “a variety show and trained
animal exhibition ” wherein the educated horse is
conspicuous by its absence. The animals range
from athletic baboons to untamable lions, war-
ranted to lash their tails at an intrepid keeper.
The variety “turns” are staged in a portable
theatre within the tent, it is said, and the pitch
selected for the composite show is on the St.
Kilda-road, south of Prince’s Bridge. It starts
with a matinee on Boxing Day.

Christmas Day will be kept holy at Mel-
bourne Town Hall as usual by the Philharmonic
Society’s annual performance of “The Messiah,”

will probably add to the joyous solemnity of the
occasion. A man who is said to be cataleptically
slumbering was buried four feet underground at
the Court a few nights ago, and, although the
management has arranged to wake him up next
Saturday (23rd) there is no visible reason why he
shouldn’t he bui’ied again before Christmas for the
amusement of the children.

About Our Nellie :
Nellie Stewart, who sails on Christmas Day, still swears
by her resolve, publicly voiced for her by Premier Bent at
her farewell performance, never to show her face in Aus-
tralia again, should she fail to grab Uncle Sam by the
wool. A feverish ambition gnaws “Sweet Nell ” nowa-
days. Only happy when she is on the boards, her House
of Mirth is no sooner silent than the Furies steal out of
their corners to whisper “Fame! Now or Never!”
Her success, past and present, her popularity, her unique
position on the Australian stage, all these are dust and
ashes to the woman who dreamed in her soaring youth
of swaying the world by her genius, and returned in her
maturity to her own small native State to find that even
her compatriots, the worshippers of her girlhood, were
apt to falter in their allegiance, unless stimulated by
show, sensation, and all the costly catch-audience nos-
trums of the hour.
The fair Helen herself, ’tis said, denies that she has
been “lucky.” “Nature showered her gifts,” says she,
“but Fortune was niggardly with hers.” And there is
truth in the contention. Born with great musical and
vocal aptitude, Our Nellie, in the recklessness of
strenuous and ambitious youth, forced and over-worked
her singing notes, with the result that the voice, which
might have won for its owner a cosmopolitan triumph,
fell short, when submitted to training, of its might-have-
been. Again, Miss Stewart’s undoubted dramatic power
is marred by the traces of those years of comic opera and
pantomime. In some of her moods, one would say that
burlesque had got into Nellie’s bones. Her beauty for all
histrionic purposes still remains unimpaired. No fairer
stage portraits could be desired than some of her Gwynne
presentments. This Commonwealth might have done
worse than secure a worthy picture of Australasia’s
beautiful, gifted, and representative actress in the close
curls, ’kerchief-cap, and quaint robes of Mistress Gwynne.
Off the stage, Miss Stewart is described by her friends
as more than ever a fascinating companion and magnetic
talker. A restlessness that she makes no attempt to hide
peeps out between moments of eag'er, interested discussion
of the god of her devotion—her stage career. She mentions
frankly both her own gifts and her defects. “Yes, I
know I’m tod much of a mimic. The temptation to
reproduce or caricature some oddity of speech or deport-
ment assails me suddenly. My little girl is just the
same.” Discussing the ideal size for an actress, she says,
“Tastes differ, of course, but I vote for a medium-sized
well-made figure on the stage. Large beauties don’t
appeal to me.” Somebody mentions Miss Stewart’s
own exquisite stage figure. “ Yes,” is the rejoinder, “ but
my hands are not decorative ; I keep them in the back-
ground as much as possible.”
Close observers of Nellie Stewart’s last Melbourne
performance discerned the melancholy which at times
saddened her smiles and haunted her dimples. Premier
Bent’s well-meant but clumsily-dreary valedictory speech
was an agony to the accomplished entertainer, trained to
keep the stage alive “on her own,” and now, on the
occasion when she had hoped to vanish in a blaze of
glory, so to speak, condemned to stand by and feel
things drag. Poor Nellie felt that she was lugged with
her plump panegyrist across the line which divides the
sublime from the ridiculous.

Adelaide Royal has been resolutely keep-
ing holiday, and the Town Hall has been the most
lively place of late, with a mixed biograph show,
which gave Port Arthur and motor accidents and
comic pictures with much impartiality. „ Inc
artist behind the scenes who did the “ boom and
the “chug-chug” did them mostreahsfcibally, butthe
most striking feature was a colored representation
of Hades and the outskirts, delicately styled the
“condemnation ”of Faust. The Tivoli also broke
out for two nights with flicker-films of a light-
weight championship alleged to have occurred m
California; but there is not much demand for
secondhand stoush in the steepled city.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Melb.” : There is to be no pantomime. Half a century
ao’O (1855) Melbourne Theatre Royal presented its first,
“°The Magician’s Daughter,” or “ Harlequin, King of the
Golden Island of Australia,” by Tom Pavey, the lawyer.
At the same time Coppin’s Olympic (the Iron Pot) gave
its first and only pantomime, Akhurst’s “Harlequin,
L.S.D., or King Malachite and the Demon of the Gold
Mine.” Coppin had transferred to the Royal in 1856,
when he presented Akhurst’s “ Harlequin Rule of Three
and Pretty Practice ; or Multiplication is Vexation, Divi-
sion is as Bad.” What ingenuity there used to be over
pantomimes. Now it is the dismal, mechanical grind
over “Sinbad,” “Aladdin,” “Cinderella,” and two or
three more, just a varnishing up of the old books by
hacks, instead of by men like Nelson Lee.
“Two Seas”: Re R. G. Knowles refusing to omit
“ damn ” from his music-hall patter (B. 2,11/'O5) because
of its appreciation by the humorous British public. lam
reminded that the mirth-provoking word “hell” runs
“ damn ” very closely in the affections of the great B.P.
When Arthur Roberts was delighting the patrons of the
old “ Pav.” in Leicester Square, the most appreciated
verse in his whistling song ran thus :
I wouldn’t like to be the Czar of Russia now, I think.
(Whistle)
Afraid to walk, afraid to talk, afraid to eat or drink,
(Whistle)
He’s just about as happy as a prisoner in his cell,
For at any hour the dreaded news may come to him to
tell
If he isn’t fit to rule on earth, he’d better rule in
“Bang!” goes the big drum. Arthur advances to the
footlights, glares reproachfully at the culprit, and, amid
shrieks of approval, remarks to the audience “ Now what’s
that wicked man thinking about ? ”
R. S. Smythe, the much-knowing, in warning the
girl or lad with a singing vice, who wants to be off to
London: —“1 know of a number of artists of both sexes
that are making a bare livelihood, and some that are not
even doing that. There are Australians in London who
would be back again in Australia if they could only raise
the money to pay their passage back again. The fees
usually paid to any but first-class artists for concerts in
England only amount to a few guineas, and engagements
are few and far between.”
Miss Gertrude Alger, a Melbourne violiniste, has secured
the Nortlicote vote and interest, and will presently pro-
ceed to Europe on the testimonial ticket. Australia ex-
pends quite a lot of money in exporting its musical
natives.
Sir Frederick Bridge, musician, talking on the Nelson
Centenary, reminded his audience that the melody of
“The Death of Nelson” was stolen by Braham, the
alleged composer, from a stirring French song. Also he
mentioned that the term, “Hearts of Oak,” should be
“ Heart of Oak,” signifying the tough core of the tree.
This is a point worth noting by singers of the ancient
Jingo song. “Heart of oak are our ships” admits of a
more forcible enunciation than if the illegitimate “s”
\yere included, and the fact that the old “ wooden walls
of England ” are out of date is no reason why a time-
honored inaccuracy shouldn’t be corrected.
The production of “ In the Bishop’s Carriage,” drama-
tised from an American novel of the same name, invites
comparison with “Leah Kleschna.” The two plays are
so similar in plot and characterisation that the public
would like to know whether the novel was stolen from
“Leah Kleschna,!*or vice versa. In its dramatised form
“The Bishop’s Carriage” is practically unknown to
America.
SANT A GLAUS, 1905.
“ O’Fipp ” : Seems to me that several among the names
given to account for the authorship of most musical
comedies must disguise the identity of a committee of our
colored brethren. If my theory is correct, these insidious
persons tossed for first go, and the Jap secured it. Re-
sult, “ The Geisha,” with white men wanting to marry
brown girls and an old Jap securing a young white wife.
Then came the Filipino’s turn in “ Florodora,” which re-
peated the tale, with the variation that brown girls from
the Philippines were the ideal wives. Next, the Chow
arrived with his “San Toy” sermon, to the effect
that the millennium will arrive when white and yellow
races intermarry freely. Now the man from Kandy is
giving us his share of the doctrine in “The Cingalee.”
The propagandists do not spoil their teaching by bringing
forth the real colored sister, with her frequent lack of
anything like good looks. White Australian girls dab a
little brown on their faces, and some playgoers seem to
imagine that Mongolians just as charming are plentiful
as rabbits somewhere in the North. Probably certain
politicians get their ideas of the advantages of a piebald
Australia from the theatre. The programme asserts that
a beautiful white girl with a hairless face represents a
Hairy Ainu woman and her wealth of whisker, and next
day the Hon. Blank Blank rises in Parliament to declare
that unless 250,000 Hairy Ainus are immediately admitted
to the Commonwealth our nation might just as well shut
up shop. And other members, who have seen alleged
specimens of the race making love and sorting tea-leaves
in their native habitat of the theatre, fall over each other
in their eagerness to support B. Blank.
“ Edyson ” : The production of “ The Girl from Kay’s ”
was nothing short of a misfortune for George Lauri, who
was called upon to reproduce the rich Mr. Hoggertheimer,
a unique character as created by Huntley, but a mere
commonplace snob as resurrected by the portly comedian
of the Comic Opera Co. Huntley’s Hoggy was all humor,
and the Dutch-rigged millionaire had to be regarded as
perhaps the drollest figure ever presented in burlesque in
Australia. Every accent, every movement was instinct
with character and pure comedy. Nobody could have
thought for a moment of resenting Hoggy’s impudence
and vulgarity, for the reason that they were as ingenuous
as the insolence and presumption of an infant, and im-
mensely ludicrous always. Max Hoggenheimer, as Lauri
understands him, is just a gross German gold-bug. The
character is not so far out, either ; but with the Huntley
example before his feyes he has not been able to clown the
part as ruthlessly as he might otherwise have done.
The two portrayals provide a vivid object lesson on the
difference between a true artist and an industrious
mechanic. Lauri is the industrious mechanic. And the
Argus says that had Lauri’s version been given first it
would have been considered superior to that of G. P.
Huntley. Acting is never so bad that daily paper
criticism can’t'contrive to be worse.
Hackenschmidt talks seriously of returning to Australia
“to take up land ” and lead a rural life. But the brawny
one can’t start pastoral pursuits for the next two years,
anyhow. He has music-hall engagements in Europe and
America that will keep him busy until 1907, and the
salaries in view are “ pretty big,” he says. Hacky is not
the man to blow about his earnings, nevertheless he
admits that he hopes to be rich presently.
Had Sydney Lyceum Theatre catered for Christmas
crowds in its theatrical character the city authorities
would have insisted on certain internal improvements.
They did so in other theatres, the Criterion spending
£12,000 to bring itself up to date. But the Lyceum
proffers a religious bill of fare, and that, it seems, makes
it unnecessary to provide all the exits and fire-escapes
the city authorities would otherwise require. And therein
the city authorities are not the ass that might be sup-
posed. The crowd at an average religious show could all
get away through the fanlight in time to sajve itself from
combustion. Moreover, the ballet is combustible, whereas
Noah’s deluge wouldn’t burn if you. poured all the oil
from Jonah’s whale over it. ■
The sort of limelight that the oriel windows of Mel-
bourne Criminal Court shed on the man standing his trial,
fell on Grant Hervey last week. As a show the function
was excellently stage managed. It was the last case of
the sessions—and the jury—wholly composed of working-
men—was chosen overnight, so that the rest of the panel
might be released. Ten o’clock was too early for the
ladies, but the court was crowded with men. After lunch
a score or so of female sightseers, acquaintances and
friends of both parties, brightened the scene. The lady
in the case ” sat silent by her husband during the fore-
noon ; afterwards she moved nearer the jury. A pale-
faced, brown-haired, grey-eyed young woman ; plump and
pleasing, but scarcely fascinating, as far as looks go, she
looked the pink of propriety in black skirt, flounced
white blouse and large, pale-green hat with a single
pink rose atop. The long wait, from three till
nearly six, while the jury argued the pros and cons,
disturbed her not; but Baker, unaccountably, seemed
nervous, even anxious, and—when not talking to friends
—unduly restless. Possibly he missed the accustomed
limelight. G.H. was, of course, invisible through this
wait ; he seemed quite at ease when called to hear the
verdict in fact, he looked the most indifferent man in
the court. He was lucky in being charged with “ shoot-
ing with intent to kill ” • a lighter count might have
resulted in a different verdict—but he chose his jury skil-
fully. And the little ’Erald did him the honor of issuing
an extra edition to notify the public that the big ex-
blacksmith was acquitted.
The intense humor seen by some vaudeville patrons in a
man with blue hair and a red nose throwing things at a
man with red hair and a blue nose resulted in a fatality at
Southampton musichall(Eng.)recently. Some knockabout
comedians were giving a sketch that largely depended
upon the missile brand of wit, when one was struck in
toe eye by a piece of bread, and was so seriously injured
that he had to undergo an operation. He died under
chloroform, and the coroner’s jury returned a verdict of
Accidental death,” instead of making it “Slain by
foolishly solid repartee.” J
How the Church improves the occasion !
The news of the death of Lady Rawson was
hardly a day old, when outside the Congrega-
tional church, in Pitt-street, Sydney, there was
posted a huge, black-bordered calico sign, an-
nouncing that a memorial service would be held
on Sunday. Another church of the same denomi-
nation went in for a sermon on “ The Grave in the
Red Sea.” To which The Bulletin says, “Oh,
the thousands of graves in seas that lie nearer
home, graves for which there have been no
memorial services, for they were only those of
men who went down to the sea in ships ; and
d bad ships they were.”
Died, the other day, aged 76, O. E.
Edwards, who formerly loomed large among
Ballarat (Vic.) mining speculators. He was a
native of Wales, and in 1852 came to Ballarat,
where he turned his trade (he was a sailmaker) to
account by making the Southern Cross flag, under
which Peter Lalor put up his fight at the Stockade.
He did a lot of speculating, and was one of the
syndicate which purchased the Egerton mine.
This mine later on achieved fame as the subject of
a big lawsuit, with issues involving something like
£60,000. Like others at the game, Edwards made
money—and lost it; and, in his later days, earned
a crust by bell-ringing in the call-room at Ballarat
Stock Exchange, where once upon a time he had
kept his end up with the best of them.
Melbourne lost two of its wealthiest
citizens last week in Fitz Gibbon and Junor
Brown. Junor Brown, the eccentric spiritualist,
is not expected to “cut up” as richly as the old
White Knight, but his estate will probably run
into six figures, and the publication of his last
will and testament is looked forward to with
interest, seeing that Premier Deakin was his
son-in-law. For some time before his death J.B.
nursed a savage antipathy to Deakin and his
belongings—railed against his political tactics,,
scoffed at his little peculiarities, refused to attend
the marriage of his daughter, and scowled like
the irate father-in-law of farcical comedy who is
pretending to cut off his relatives with a shilling.
It remains to be discovered whether Junor
Brown, after all, was not secretly proud of his
connection with the amiable Alfred.
A probate notice in Sydney newspapers
recalls a personage historical in Australia. In the
will of William Lachlan Macquarie Redfern, late
of Jermyn-street, St. James, application is being
made for the seal of the State Court. The origi-
nal Redfern was a surgeon’s mate at the time of
the Mutiny of the Nore, and expressed sympathy
with the men. He was sent to Botany Bay for
his sympathies, and was one of four emancipists
whom Governor Lachlan Macquarie made Jus-
tices of the Peace and invited to Government
House. Redfern had a grant of 100 acres in the
suburb now named after him. The recently-
deceased man, if the baptismal names be an indi-
cation, must have been a son, and, if so, a very old
man.
By way of discouraging these National
Ass organisations which “object” to democratic
voters wholesale—whereby each voter has either
to lose a day’s work so that he may turn up at
the Revision Court and prove that he isn’t dead,
or else lose his vote —the new Federal law orders
a deposit of ss. with each objection. Likewise it
enacts that if the objection is frivolous, the voter
may recover up to £5 for expenses attending the
court. In this connection Page, M.H.R., told a
story of how a Tory association in North Queens-
land once took the heroic step of lodging objec-
tions to the effect that every live democratic
elector in the constituency was dead or had gone
away. This sort of wholesale jest, when the
price is ss. and expenses for each joke, will go out
of fashion.
A fool action that is coming before the
High Court is an application on behalf of the State
of N.S.W. to recover much money from the Com-
monwealth. The Australian Government pur-
chased a bit of land to use as a post-office for the
benefit of the people of N.S.W., the people of
N.S.W. paying, of course, their share of the pur-
chase money. Now the Carruthers Government
demands stamp duty on the transaction.
As the people of N.S.W. are included in the
people of Australia they will have to pay their
share per head of the amount, and their share of the
legal expenses—that is if the claim succeeds—and
that will leave them just about where they were.
If the claim does not succeed N.S.W. will have to
pay all the costs. It is a certain loss one way and
no profit the other way, but it gives Bad Boy
Carruthers a chance to be nasty.
THE WILLIAMSON GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ The girl of the Royal Comic Opera co. forms a type in
herself. You would know her anywhere.” The Austral-
asian.
You may talk of allurements of Paris,
The kiss of its dainty grisette,
With tricks, smiles and laughter to harass
The heart and the pocket beset;
Lorn lovers may strum their gay lute on
The Spanish maid’s ebony curl,
Or praise the pale plaits of the Teuton,
But we’ve got the Williamson girl.
Great London has none to suggest her,
Where fashion and beauty inflame
That rorty rectangle of Leicester,
That isn’t as square as its name.
More brilliance have we in the dancing
And contours and grace of that pearl
Among women, entirely entrancing—
The wonderful Williamson girl.
Who cares what the Puritan clan did
When Gibson evolved them a type ?
The damsels that man has demanded
Are human and rosy and ripe,
Whose smiles and whose dimples besprinkle
The stage where their petticoats swirl
Round limbs that in shapeliness twinkle—
And such is the Williamson girl.
And may she continue to do so
Until ’tis the day to prepare
The intricate points of her trousseau,
And marry a big millionaire.
Come ! fire every heart and despoil it,
Till lingerie lacy you furl
’Neath folds of a tailor-made toilet—
No longer a Williamson girl.

At Brisbane lately it took four Judges,
three barristers and two teams of solicitors several
days to decide whether a 14-year-old girl should
be brought up as a Wesleyan or a Roman Catholic.
The girl herself wasn’t consulted. In all proba-
bility the poor kid would rather have been brought
up to go to the theatre regularly, or taken to a
circus.
A South African mining engineer tells the
Illustrated London News something about the
South African Chinese curse :
They are an unsavory crowd to handle, and revel in
mrschief of every kind. Devilry is, perhaps, a better
word than mischief in this instance. It was a rule in our
T'jj 6 when a man had to climb up on a rope or rope
ladder from one stage to another a Chinaman should
always go first. If this simple insurance were disre-
garded, some Celestial gentleman, quite unseen, would be
fairly safe to take the chance of hurling rock or stones on
the head of the climber. On many occasions these
Chinamen have tampered with the cage by which we go
to our work, and we have to examine the fittings care-
fully every time. The conditions of work have even got
U P9T • e . nerves of men who have served on mining
staffs in wilder countries than South Africa. The railway
points have been deliberately altered on several occa-
sions, small accidents have resulted, and big ones been
averted by chance. Indeed, I think it fair to sav that
John Chinaman has no moral sense at all as we Westerners
see things, and he would not flinch from anv action,
however monstrous ... We had the whole camp out one
night because we interfered to prevent an unpopular
overseer from being roasted alive. The Chinaman as 1
have met him on the Rand is not on speaking terms with
honesty. You can leave nothing within his reach. He
is as susceptible to bright colors as a magpie, and when
once a thing has disappeared, it will never come back.

The latest execution at Perth (W.A.) was
a gruesome muddle. Two of the hangees quar-
relled wildly in a foreign language on the scaffold.
One of them held on to the rope, and refused to
suspend. The hangman lost his presence of mind
and wept, and the chief gaol-warder fell down
t-ie trap along with the hanged prisoners, and
dabbed his head so hard on the pavement 12ft.
below that he was picked up insensible. For
sheer confusion it was just like Premier Rason’s
finances.

Melb. Hospital, after going through a
painful series of operations in the effort to tack
the title “Royal” on to its name, has ended
pretty much where it began. First of all, some-
body got the abject idea and mentioned it to his
abject colleagues on the Hospital Committee. It
pleased them so much that the Governor, or the
Governor-General, or King Ned, or the type-
writer to the Under-Secretary was approached.
I he appeal was breathed into a favorable ear, and
the committee was told that if it liked it could
have it. The committee decided officially that it
would be a glorious thing to be “Royal.” It was
decided to spend £5O on the job. The subscribers
met and resolved that it would be just heavenly
to be ,. . Ro 7 aL ’ All these things were notified to
f Ehief Secretary, and now the Chief Secretary
(it s Gillott, and he’s a member of the Hospital
Committee) has written in cold, formal style to
say that the change of name must be sanctioned
by the original subscribers—those who gave the
place its original title of the Melbourne Hospital.
As most of the original subscribers have been dead
for the last twenty years, and it would be as easy
to get the consent of the lost Ten Tribes, the
enmmittee begins to think that somebody has been
playing a vile Christmas jest with it.

Waiotapu prison in Noithern Maoriland—
the thermal region whither good conduct prisoners
are sent to plant trees —is quite a convict’s para-
dise, but after some recent revelations in the
Supreme Court the idyllic existence of the inmates
will probably be harassed by stronger discipline.
A couple of prisoners strolled out one night and
broke into the Waiotapu Hotel to secure liquor
and tobacco ; the incident ended by one “ turning
dog” on the other, and giving evidence against
him. Cross-examination revealed that playing
hazard for tobacco is an every day occurrence, and
that there is a fepielers College in the prison, a
gentleman convict being the Professor thereof.
Esperance, the decayed Westralian town-
ship that once had high hopes of being the seaport

On top of that
somebody else
has got dam-
ttg-co against
the councd for trespass, and another man has
been awarded £4 damages as against the council
clerk because the latter left his name off the
municipal roll. It looks as though it ought to be
worth about £4 to have one’s name off such a
roll; but some people have strange ambitions.

“Nulla ” : I think the making of crooked
streets must be a mania with the authorities about
Sydney. Even in some of the comparatively
modern suburbs, the roads are as the writhing of a
wounded corkscrew. At Coogee for instance,
there are streets, formed during the last few years,
which, though not so tortuous as Reid’s career, are
hardly as straight as a dog’s hind leg.
THE BARGAIN CRAZE.
PROFESSIONAL BARGAIN HUNTER : “ What are your terms?”
DENTIST : "Ten guineas for a full set, jewelled and enamelled; stopping, twelvec-and-six;
filling, seven-and-six.”
P.B.H.: “ Oh! but haven't you any remnants?"
At Melbourne City Court last week a wan
young woman was committed for trial on a pitiful
charge of bigamy, laid by the father of her several
offspring. Informant stated that he took the
woman for his wife eight years ago and lived con-
tentedly with her until last September, when she
secured a billet as barmaid, he being out of work.
Incidentally it was stated that before she started
to pull beer she had pawned a pair of boots for his
benefit. “ But from what he heard he resolved to
take a warrant out for her arrest on a charge of
bigamy,” because she told him when her fourth
child was born, 17 months previously, that she had
been married before he met her, and the other
fellow was still living. All those 17 months
he had, by his own showing, been a consenting
party to the bigamy. It was open to him to leave
the woman and get legally married to some one
else if he wished, but he hung on until he “heard
something” that apparently made him jealous of
the first husband, and then he appealed to the
Law. Isn’t it about time for the blessed Law to
introduce a statute of limitations to meet such
cases as this ? Five years possession of a woman
under a marriage contract ought to make it
binding at the option of either party, and if the
Women’s Defence Leagues want a new plank in
their platform, they might at least agitate for a
one-sided option in favor of the sex.

The recent discovery in Sydney harbor of
a very dead Chinaman, with a rope round his
neck, has again drawn attention to the fact that
there is still a considerable smuggling of Mongols
into the Commonwealth. The smuggling is done
by the Chrnise crews of vessels coming from Asia,
and the contraband persons are hidden in all
manner of places—often in recesses among the
coal. When the ship rolls it often happens that
the coal falls in, and there is a defunct Chinaman,
and then the remains are sneaked overboard.
Also, if the contraband article gets into bad con-
dition, and its groans are liable to attract attention,
it goes overboard. The bulk of the passage
money isn’t paid till delivery ; if it were paid in
advance, it seems to be generally believed that,
the smuggled Chinaman would be helped over-
board by his countrymen as a regular thing. In
the present case the report is that the Chinaman
deteriorated on the voyage, and, being too lame
to go ashore, he went to the bottom instead. If
the sea-bottom could be investigated all the way
along the regular track from China to here, prob-
ably many a pig-tailed marauder would be found
sleeping his last sleep down there among the
things that Clarence saw in his dream.
In sentencing the Cohens, father and son,
for fraudulent bankruptcy, N.S.W. Justice
Prynnge carried to excess his unpleasant habit of
throwing in a heavy sermon along with the sen-
tence. To the father he handed out four years’
gaol, while the son got nine months, and Justice
Prynnge concluded a moral exhortation with the
advice to little Solomon never to see his father
Moses again. Such advice was distinctly
anti-social. If Mr. Prynnge felt that he
must indulge in a little moral exhortation
in order to waste the time of the Court,
he might at least have followed the maxim
which both Christian and Hebrew ethics enjoin—
“ Honor thy father.” Granted that father Moses
Cohen is a bad lot. Is is good advice to son Solo*
mon Cohen to let the old man go to the devil or
the poor-house when his gaol sentence is ended ?
Wouldn’t it be better to urge him to stick to the
old man and try to better him ? There’s too little
respect for parents in this community as it is,
without judicial encouragement to unfilial con-
duct. To a Hebrew, by the way, advice to
“drop” a parent would most likely be useless.
One thing to the credit of the ancient race of
Palestine is that, as a rule, it stands by old man
Moses and old woman Rebecca for all it is worth.

Something unusual in the way of a sensa-
tion was provided in the Collings judicial separa-
tion case in Brisbane, when Pa Collings rose to
state on oath that he didn’t brand, or attempt to
brand, his daughter Myrtle along With the calves.
This charge of putting the cow-brand on a
daughter is comparatively fresh, though in a land
of so much cow it might be expected to arise at
any time.

After a long period, during which it dug
out nothing save little ha’penny squabbles, the
Victorian Commission which is inquiring into the
shockingly disorganised Victorian bobby fell last
week on something interesting. This was a detec-
tive who admitted having issued cheques on a
bank where he had no account, and having bor-
rowed money from a discharged prisoner. There
was also a mysterious yarn about one ’tec having
accused another of receiving a £5O bribe, and
withdrawing the unpleasant remark in writing at
the order of a third boss detective, who wanted
the force to present a united chest to the public,
whatever its internal dissensions might be. Also,
there was a hazy tale about how a ’tec said another
’tec got £2OO a year for warning gambling clubs
about intended raids. When all these ’tecs have
finished throwing the mud of slander and the
slush-ball of aspersion at each other, the force
will badly need a clean uniform.

While the glorious music rolls,
Wave on wave of melody,
Till it stirs their shrunken souls
To a transient thought of me,
Their brother in adversity.
These have all—and I have naught;
These will buy—and I am bought :
I must seek—but these are sought ;
These shall feast where I have wrought.
What is it to them that I
Starve and languish, groan and sigh ;
Workless, breadless, wander by—
Hopeless live, and homeless d.e ?
Yea, the very Christ they sing,
Could He but come back again,
To the gutter they would fling ;
He should seek for bread in vain
Did He unrevealed remain !
Yet the earth is broad and fair ;
All things needful flourish there ;
Fields that yield, and trees that bear—
Yet 1 am forbade a share !
I may build, and I may break,
I may hew and dig and make ;
I may reap and thresh and bake,
But no morsel must I take
If their livery I wear not,
If their brand be not upon me,
If by their dead gods I swear not
With a scornful gaze they con me,
And my toilings have undone me.
Yea, the Church—accursed name !
On the High God puts the shame —
And The Unnameablk would blame
For the miseries which came
Of its teachings long ago,
In the dreadful years and slow,
When to Freedom it was foe
And forbade mankind to grow.
Powers, of Darkness—Powers of Light-
Look upon us all, and see
Privilege, and wealth, and might,
Joined to “ intercede ” for me —

Dowieism seems to pay. Dowie’s locum
tenens or deputy prophet in Victoria is Voliva, a
tremendous person who speaks through his nose.
He carefully watched the evidence given at
Melbourne morgue, last week, over a lady disciple
whose faith failed to make her whole, and over
whose death the nasty coroner insisted on holding
an inquest. Voliva drove up in a flash landau,
drawn by a pair of magnificent bay horses. On
the box-seat sat a regal-looking coachman and
footman. Inside sat Voliva —beside him a nice-
looking 22-year-old laxly shorthand-writer. Those
who knew Wilbur Glenn Voliva thought he was
going into the mortuary to raise the _ dead ;
but he didn’t. He strode into the inquest
chamber as Jove might have entered Olympus.
His splendid tailoring, his lofty mien, and his
god-like gait severely frightened Coroner Candler.
He looked as though Voliva might expect him to
crawl about the room on his hands and knees.
Voliva, however, merely muttered something
about “Peace,” and sat down on an ordinary
chair in the usual way. The shorthand girl
crowded round him and took a verbatim note of
the proceedings. This so upset Mr. Candler that
he reserved his decision for a day. But despite the
deputy prophet, and the landau, and the two big
horses, and the coach-gentleman and the foot-
gentleman, and the shorthand-writer and all the
rest, the woman who had been faith-healed till
she died remained dead. And the old shoeless
pedestrian gospel of Galilee showed better results
than that.

Nothing like revolutions for making
phrases. Prince Khilkoff angered the Moscow
railway strikers—asking for an Fight Hours Day

“he had worked 16 hours a day, and still con-
trived to do one hour’s reading.” “ We,” replied
the men grimly, “ require more time for reading.”

Westralia seems to be getting tired of an
old wheeze. Usually when an incorrigible rascal
lias come up before a Westralian beak he has
pleaded for a chance to “ getaway to Melbourne,”
and pretty often the beak has let him go —a nice
brotherly arrangement by which Westralia has
got rid of its criminals at the expense of Victoria.
Justice Burnside shut down on the plea the other
day, and gave the man two years instead ; but
about the same time Gus Roe, S.M., decided to
try the old dodge once more, and let his man off
on the understanding that he worked His passage
across. Three days later the man—Avho ought to
have been by that time reefing the marlin-spike
on the Australian Bight—was up again for aggra-
vated assault, and it turned out that it was his
02ud conviction. Even Gus Hoe, S.M., dropped
the old dodge of passing the prisoner on to a
neighbor when he heard that.

paper mentioned the affluent coin, whereupon ti e
President of the Sydney Ladies Pro-Nigger League wrote
that her league wasn’t aware of the existence of the
other one—the sixpenny it.on. This case of
Codlin repudiating Short leaves some doubt as to which
is the genuine anti-Australian organisation, and implies
that B. Smith might have inadvertently brayed in the
wrong paddock, so to speak.

Adelaide ’Varsity undergrads, this year
borrowed for the first time the Sydney idea of a
burlesque procession through the streets on Com-
memoration Day. The chief feature was a dray
showing an operation being conducted with a two-
handed saw, two powerful nurses holding down a
lighting patient the while. The cheerful inscrip-
tion was:—
Press descriptions of the arrival
of the new flagship Powerful were very
silent on the fact that the new admiral
kept dodging outside Sydney Heads
waiting for high water, being afraid
that his lengthy deep ship could not
navigate the channel up the harbor till
then. Seeing that Port Jackson is
about the easiest port in the Common-
wealth to enter, the Powerful, it would
seem, will also be able to enter and
leave Port Phillip and the rest only on
the top of the tide. In the event of
war it is to be hoped that an enemy
will be found c m i lerate enough to con-
sider the tide before inconveniencing
the new flagship.
“ Timbarra ” : The Bulletin is wrong in
saying that we have only King Billy’s boomerang
to shy at an invader. Melbourne alone possesses
two German bands, a paddock full of Chow-made
furniture, scores of l)ago dining rooms, many
Chinese banana merchants, Rickards’ nigger,
Monkey Cole, the Argus, and the Post Office

“A.C.L.”: Re the hair-pads which nearly
every woman now wears. It is curious that
fashion nearly always decrees that women shall
pad some part designed by nature to be flat,
Horribly insanitary things, these pads. Worn
from one month to another, they must gather up
a ll kinds of dirt. As a rule, the scantier the hair
thy fatter the pad, and to most women it seems
quite immaterial that the stuffing shall match the
tnatch. Also, to a mere male the pad is a
howling fraud. Viewed from the front, a
luxuriant sweep of thick hair rises over a snowy
brow, yet this jungle of tresses ends ignominiously
at the back in a knot the size of a penn’orth of
coppers.
A little up-country N.S. W. political league
casts the light of this idea on the liquor question :
That this meeting deems it expedient to prohibit any
man from paying for another man’s drink, except in his
own house.
That goes too far on the anti-social track, but
there’s not the least doubt that the “ shouting ”
nuisance is the cause of many cases of drunken-
ness. Dunn, Triggs, Blake and Thompson meet
casually, and Blake, hospitable soul, suggests a
drink. All are thirsty, and a whisky-and-
soda each meets the situation admirably and
leaves them more cheerful citizens. But,
then, Dunn, Triggs and Thompson have
each an uneasy feeling that something more is
demanded of the situation. Blake has shouted.
Should the}' not be clamorous too? Thompson
finally suggests another. Not one of them wants
it, but Dunn and Triggs assent, as otherwise it
would be thought that, though they would drink
with Blake, they wouldn’t drink with Thompson.
Ultimate result four drinks each—three of them
not wanted. The “sho'uting” custom calls for
limitation—yet its total abolition, and the conse-
quent sad spectacle of everybody paying for h:s
own liquor and “drinking with the flies” in a
lonesome and speechless fashion is not wholly de-
sirable either. If legislation could provide that,
when a certain number of friends meet, it shall be
illegal for them all to shout, but that a “ bob in ”
shall be permissible, it might perhaps meet the
case.

Puzzling to understand why the Watch-
man, the organ of Sydney Orangeism, published
practically verbatim the evidence before the
Select Committee which so effectively exposed
the Orange champion. Rev. Woods Rutledge, and
exploded his statements about the Public Service.
Possibly the Orange intellect is so Weak that
Watchman readers can be trusted to read into
anything which that paper prints proofs of
Rome’s perfidv, even when the thing printed is
an exposure of Woods Rutledge’s pious “snakes.”

Paris Nesbifc, K.C., raised a line point of
law in Adelaide lately on behalf of an insolvent
charged (under the local Act) with “leaving the
State for the purpose of defrauding his creditors.”
There was no offence, he claimed, until “ the last
portion of insolvent’s person” had crossed the
border—and the moment that had happened S.A.
law had no jurisdiction over him ! “ Who drafted
the fool of an Act?” asked the Judge (or words to
that effect), and Nesbit replied, “I think that I
did.”

The plaintiff in a breach of promise case,
heard at Melbourne County Court last week,
stated that when her lover pleaded for an early
union she said —“ I don’t know about getting
married, as a Chinese doctor has forbidden me to
get married until my health is fixed up.” Defen-
dant subsequently decided that it would be a pity
to mar the effect of the Chow treatment by marry-
ing the lady.
The Melbourne Chow has converted Little
Bourke-street, in the heart of the city, into a
horror. Periodically the police stir up Little
Bourke-street. Sometimes it’s fan-tan ; some-
times it’s sly grog ; sometimes it’s lottery tickets ;
last week it was disorderly houses. A few hoary
Chows and their female goods were dragged before
Panton, P.M. It was shown that the women did
nothing but smoke opium and earn dollars for the
boss of the seraglio—for Ah Who or Ah What or
Ah Where, Pan ton discoursed luridly, his pero-
ration in each case being 12 months’ “hard”
without the option. The women found in the
houses all swore that they had just arrived a
second or two before the police raided them. Most
of them were married, or said they were, to Chows;
three claimed Japanese ruffians for husbands;
and all declared that they were highly respectable.
If the ghastly, holy humbugs who wail about the
iniquity of excluding the Chow Will go for a
walk some fine night—not up Little Bourke-street,
but through the labyrinth of reeking lanes which
Little Bourke-street serves to screen from the
passer-by, their very noses should convert them.
Melbourne’s Little Lonsdale-street marks the
lowest depth to which the white woman can
descend with only the white man to help her
but it is respectability comjjared with the,
Little Bourke-s reet lanes, where the unutterable
Chow has dug an abyss that no white man or
woman ever dreamed of before he came.

At the recent marine inquiry into the loss
of the North Coast (N.S. W.) steamer Wollumbin,
when the verdict was “Just sank,” or words to
that effect, the presiding Judge again drew public
attention to the unreasonable hours worked by
officers on some coastal boats. It is not long since
the Court found that a steamer ran into an island
in broad daylight because the master, after 30
hours on deck, was asleep on watch. In the Wol-
lumbin inquiry it was not insinuated that the ship
was lost because the officers were all worn-out, but
the Judge pointed out that, had the circumstances
demanded arduous effort from master, mates and
engineers, their condition was such that sustained
exertion would have been too much to expect. It
is common enough for a coastal master to return
from a round trip and say that he has not had his
clothes off once, and such a state of affairs should
engage the attention of Parliament. It is one of
N.S. W.’s grievances, and, though it isn’t a Federal
grievance, it might still get a little notice.

The Maoriland Presbyterian has a pretty
tall opinion of himself. For instance witness this
clause in a recent report of a General Assembly
committee :
It may be well occasionally not to keep silent about the
exceptionally lofty standard of thought and conduct
which our Church, through God’s grace to our fathers,
inherits, and which association with members of even
some of the worthiest of the sister communities is liable
to impair.
This statement that the old Whisky Church can’t
associate with even the better class of other
denominations without being deteriorated has
already led one angry citizen to publish the ille-
gitimacy statistics of Scotland—the Presbyterian
stronghold—and to make insulting remarks.
THE GAME HE KNEW.
On Monday, the King: shook hands with G.W.Tyler, one
of the Maoriland Rugby footballers, and congratulated
the team on its success.
HIS MAJ. : “ Now if it only were baccarat I’d
hare a cut at you myself.”
“P.”: Walking through Sydney Domain
recently I passed two urchins in converse. One
wanted his mate to do something or other, and
persuasion having failed, had got him down to
bribery. “ I’ll let yer ’ave a spin er me top if yer
do.” “ Naw.” “Let yer have two spins.”
“Maw.” “ ’Ere, I’ll give yer the thing.” “Naw.”
First boy thought awhile ; then he was suddenly
inspired : “ Tell yer what. If yer do, I’ll show
yer where me father died ! ” His mate’s eyes glis-
tened, and he replied “ Right-oh ” with en-
thusiasm. I watched the lads, and saw them
walk to the rear of Sydney Hospital, at which
they gazed with great interest.”
Two ways by which a woman can
Win homage from the heart of man:
With beauties rare she may enslave
The young and old, the gay and grave.
With clever arts of cooking, too,
She may hold one for ever true.
This is sufficient to explain
Why cooks are always very plain.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
.The A.M.P. directors have once more resur-
rected the matter of going outside Australia after busi-
ness and investments. Five years ago, for the severalth
time, they asked the question, and for the severalth time
policy-holders roared a “No” at them. Now, just at a
t.me of year when it may be difficult to get policy-holders
to take an interest in the matter, they slip out the old
question once more. As usual, they don’t ask for a plain
“\es” or “No.” They ask policj’-holders to appoint
either the chairman or the vice-chairman their proxy, and
both chairman and vice-chairman favor the proposal. It
is absolutely certain that, if they ask often enough, they
will get a “ Yes ” majority some time, and then
they will stop asking lest they should get a “No.”
If Brown, and Jones play nap for a sheep-
station, and Brown’s wins aren’t allowed to count,
it is dead-sure that Jones will eventually get the sheep
station ; and that is the case with the A.M.P. The direc-
tors have been told “No” again and again ; but these
“ Noes ” apparently don’t count. Thev ask again, and do
it under circumstances under which it will be easiest to
sneak a “Yes” majority ; and that “Yes” will count.
The whole thing looks far too much like a trick to be
worthy of such a vast semi-national concern as the A.M.P.
And what’s the excuse for appealing again to
policy-holders so soon after the last decision, anyway?
General Manager Teece furnishes it—“ Since the matter
was last before members there are now in existence some
CO,OOO new policy-holders who did not on the former
occasion have policies on the books.” Sixty thousand
new policy-holders have been added in five years. And
.vet the very first reason given by the directors for seeking
the change is that the Commonwealth is practically at a
standstill in the matter of population (which it isn’t), so
tnat “ the acquisition of new business ” is “ difficult and
costly.” In one sentence they say that they can’t get
new business, and in the next they say that in the past
five years they have got so much new business that the
“No ” of five years back can’t be taken as conclusive to-
day. So the only excuse offered for sneaking behind the
“ No ” of five years back is a sham on the face of it.
The directors say that “ the constant reduction
in the average sum assured under new policies shows
that the business now obtainable is of a less stable char-
acter than has been the case in the past.” The directors
seem to pursue the policy-holders not only with argu-
ments that won’t hold water, but-with facts that won’t
hold water either. For here is a statement showing the
av rage amount per new policy issued during the past
live years:—
1900 .. .. £251 I 1903 .. .. £258
1901 .. .. 253 1904 .. .. 258
1902 .. .. 238 !
Where is the “ constant reduction in the average sum
assured under new policies”? The directors, if their
arguments bump one another, anyhow owe it to the
policy-holders not to mislead them ‘with mis-statements
of fact. .Supposing the directors get their “Yes”
majority while the bulk of the policy-holders are busy
pursuing the Christmas goose, how, in the face of these
figures, compiled from their own reports, do they think
the matter would look in an Equity Court ?
The A.M.P. directors say that “the constant
reduction in the average sum assured under the new
policies ” shows that “the new business now'obtainable
is of a less stable character than has been the case in the
past.” The first part has been shown to be a mis-
statement ; the second partis both a mis-statement and
a libel on the men of moderate means in the Common-
wealth. Compare the figures for the last two years w'ith
those for the corresponding years of last decade

Compared with the position 10 years ago, there are now'
only half as many forfeitures whether they are reckoned
in proportion to new business or to total business. In
otherwords, the present business is more than twice as
stable as that of 10 years ago. And yet on the strength
of telling them the exact opposite, the A.M.P. directors
ask policy-holders to agree to a certain proposal. This
is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of fact, and the
directors’ owm reports are the authority.
There may be another chance of digging further
into the directors’ manifesto, and proving that almost
all their statements are, to put it more politely than the
case calls for, plausible fabrications. Meantime, while
the directors don’t make out any case at all for the
change, here are a few reasons against the change :
(1) The A.M.P. has built up one of the most phenomenal
insurance successes in the world. Its bonuses have been
larger than those given by any other office probably in
the world. This has been the result partly of the high
interest-earnings in Australia, and partly of the excep-
tional mortality experience of Australia.* It is now pro-
posed to share bonuses with people in countries where
the interest-earnings are lower and the death-rate is
higher. This will inevitably mean smaller bonuses for
Australian policy-holders.
(2) The death rate in England and Wales in 1903 was
154 per 10,000 people, and that was below the average.
In Australasia for the same year it was 118 per 10,000.
The A.M.P. directors want the Australasian policy-
holders, who belong to one of the healthiest and longest-
lived peoples in the world, to share their insurance and
their bonuses with people who are far less healthy and less
long-lived. This means reduced bonuses.
(3) The A.M.P. last year earned £4 9s. per cent, on the
average, of its funds. The Scottish Widows’ Fund, of
approximately the same size, earned £3 16s. 6d. per cent.
Bonuses arise partly from a superior death-rate, partly
from superior interest-earnings. To shift funds from
where they earn £4 9s. per cent, to a country where they
can earn only £3l6s. 6d. per cent., means reduced bonuses.
(4) The Scottish Widows’ Fund is about the most suc-
cessful life office in Great Britain. According to the last
issue of “ The Insurance Blue Book,” the previous seven
years’ reversionary Scottish Widows’ bonus on a life policy
of £100,: taken out at age 30, and in force 10 years, was at
the rate of £1 15s. 9d. per cent, per annum. The last
A.M.P. bonus under similar conditions was £2 16s. The
A.M.P. cannot hope to be more successful in Great Britain
than the Scottish Widows. Therefore the more business
it does there the nearer will its bonuses, both Australian
and English, get to the £1 15s. 9d. of the Scottish Widows’
Fund ; the further will they get from the £2 16s. earned
under present conditions. This means reduced bonuses
•for Australian policy-holders. The Australian policy-
holder will have to forego some of the bonuses which the
Australian business earns in order to increase the British
policy-holders’ bonus.
(5) If there were a country in the world where insur-'
ance business was earning larger bonuses than in Aus-
tralia, that would be the country to go to if an extension
were desired. But a business man who can make 2J per
cent., profit at home doesn’t take his goods to a place
where the most successfu’ people in the same business are
only making If per cent. Yet that is the proposal of the
A.M.P. directors.
(6) There is a third way by which bonuses are earned—
by a low expense rate. Two Australian offices have for
some time past been struggling after business in Great
Britain and S’Africa ; and here are the expense rates for
last year of those two and the A.M.P. :
Expenses p.c. Expenses p.c.
of Income. of Premiums.
A -M.P 16 7 p.c. £l3 10 6 p.c.
National Mutual .. 18 1 6 „ 26 410 „
Colonial Mutual 20 15 1 „ 27 18 0 „
It costs the Australian offices which have been doing what
the A.M.P. directors now want to do twice as much
to get and keep their business as it costs the A.M.P. This
means reduced bonuses.
If the A.M.P. policy-holders want less bonuses
than they have been getting, they will either vote “ Yes,”
or give an open proxy to the directors, which means the
same thing. If they want to get all the bonuses they
Can, they will vote “ No,” the same as they did five years
ago.

In both departments the progress made in the last few
years stamps the T. and G. as one of the live offices of the
Commonwealth ; and the past year’s progress is even
ahead of the excellent average made since 1900—the year
when “ the blight of Federation ” fell upon the land and
began to shrivel things up, according to the testimony of
people who scorn such definite tests as figures supply.
Not only is this society doing a great deal more insurance
business, but it is able to get people to insure at a much
less expenditure of tongue and shoe-leather and money
than previously. The exact figures on the outlay of
tongue are not available ; but these figures cover the cost
in moneju—

The figures are becoming quite respectable; in the
ordinary section the T. and G. is now in the group which
includes theM.L.A., Colonial Mutual, and Widows’ Fund,
which is very fair company. In the mournful four-pence-
a-fortnight department, it still costs more than half the
total receipts from premiums and interest to pursue the
fourpence, leaving less than half available for claims;
and yet, with the single exception of the Citizens, no
other Australian office has published better figures.
Considering the extent of the new business, the improve-
ment in the ordinary department expense-rate is even
better than it looks. In 1900, when the cost was
£36 17s. Bd. percent., the proportion of new premiums
was 23'3 per cent. ; now, though the proportion of new
business is 24'3 per cent., the expenses are down to
£2l Is. Id. There is still plenty of room, no doubt, for
improvement ; the office must work down to a 15 per
cent, expense rate before it can be reckoned among the
first three in Australia, and that is some distance away
yet. Bonuses are meantime helped on by the society’s
high interest earnings :

Only the National Mutual and City Mutual show larger
figures than those for 1905 above. But the National
Mutual has only 5\3 per cent, and the City Mutual only
9'4 per cent, of their total assets invested in public securi-
ties, while the T. & G. has 26T per cent., which is about
the same proportion as the A.M.P. and the Citizens.
Apparently, however, in regard to public securities the
T. & G; favors the municipal rather than the State
security. The holding of freeholds, including properties
held as mortgagee in possession, is excessive, amounting
to 22 per cent.-of total assets ; it is surprising, under the
circumstances, that the interest-rate is so high. But this
is a legacy. Present surplus funds are going almost
wholly into public securities (£46,000 has been added
during the year), loans on policies, &c. ; and that is
another of the several things which call on the public to
again view the T. & G. w'i th respect.
But large figures are not everything ; one must
know how they are procured before deciding whether
they are good or not. Surpluses and bonuses are a tre-
mendous factor in securing new life assurance business,
and the T. and G. shows (in its quinquennial valuation)
something considerable in that way. But how? “ A full
year’s premium was assumed to be due in each case in the
ordinary department,” says the actuary. A full year’s
premium is not really due, though, more than once "in 365
times. On any given date there will be premiums
which have anything to run from 1 day to 365 days.
And while “ a full year’s premium is assumed to
be due,” what about a full year’s liability ? Has
that been allowed for also ? If not, it seems pretty clear
that the surplus is over-estimated, and the proposed
bonus not actually earned. As to the industrial depart-
ment, endowment policies to the number of 34,982 have
been issued ; and apparently most of the increase in the
society’s industrial business has been under this table.
Industrial assurance is poor assurance at the best; but
endowment industrial assurance is probably the ’least
desirable, of all forms of it. Under industrial life or “full-
tehn” tables a family at least gets the full amount
of insurance, no matter when the bread-winner
dies; but under industrial endowment tables, it
gets only the premiums back if the insured ’dies
before the endowment period expires—and in some
offices not that much. Practically it amounts to
an insurance society running a savings bank business,
and absorbing 50 per cent, of the deposits in collecting
them. The increase in the industrial department, since
it is largely due to activity in the endowment branch,
must therefore be viewed with mixed feelings. The
premiums under these endowment policies total £48,173.
The sum assured is £597,810; the reserves already
accumulated are only £49,734 ; and considering the small-
ness of the reserves, and the comparative short duration
of the average industrial endowment policy, there is a
question whether the premiums are sufficient for their
purpose. This is a case where a Federal insurance
department should be able to do most important work—
either by certifying, after actuarial investigation, that
the premiums are sufficient for, their purpose, or, if it
found that the tables were unsound, prohibiting business
under them—just as the French insurance law does. At
present there is merely a haunting suspicion ; and insur-
ance is too serious a business to be mixed up with
haunting suspicions.

With one exception, the net profit is the largest shown
for 13 years ; this may be due to less provision being
necessary for bad and doubtful debts, Dalgetv’s customers
being now mostly in temporary affluence. The capital is
£1,000,000 ; outstanding debentures amount to £2,263,210
irredeemable, and £442,850 terminable. During the past
year £lOO,OOO terminable 4 per cents, have been issued.

With the cheapening of money for Australian use the co.
probably begins to again look with sorrow on its 4£ and 4
per cent, irredeemable debenture stock. It issued the
first of these 4£ per cents, over 20 years ago, and the first
of the 4 per cents, about 17 years ago ; and though Aus-
tralia is supposed to have gone to the dogs since then, the
co. finds it can nowadays get money on much better
terms, which suggests a grave doubt whether the animal
that Australia is supposed to have gone to isn’t a mere
figure of speech. Anyhow, here is a co. which is very
closely connected with the Australian industry that is
supposed to have suffered most, and it has paid no divi-
dend of less than 5 p.c., and this year makes over 8£ p.c.
on its capital, and looks as though it might easily make
considerably mote until a bad season happens. But even
in a bad seasop, when the horrors of drought move the
churches to special prayers, this co. can pay bigger divi-
dends than Australian manufacturing industries can pay
in good times under the present tariff. Yet, though Aus-
tralian manufactures are thus, it seems, suffering from a
more severe drought than struck Dalgetv’s and other
pastoralists, no b s mp is ordering special prayers on their
behalf. Why not?

A timber co. which doesn’t go in for tree-planting as well
as tree-chopping is in much the same position as a mining
co. ; its profits are not true profits, because they result
from using up the assets. In this case the co. has
an Assets Depreciation Fund, “ being for timber cut off
from formation of co. to Aug-. 31st, 1901, and consequently
not represented by assets.” In 1902 the directors an-
nounced that “in calculating the trading profit it has been
decided to provide for the value of the timber cut
off the co.’s land during the year.” This explains the
drop in profits after 1901. The profits shown down to
1901 (inclusive) were gross ; since 1901 they have been
net, except that depreciation of plant has to be charged
against them. Previous to 1901 it was possible to find
out how much of the so-called profits the directors had
applied to wipe out capital account (in other words, how
much they had put into the assets depreciation fund).
Under the present system the accounts disclose nothing
of that kind. The directors may have written off Id., or
they may have written off £25.000 ; so the disclosed pro-
fits may be real, or they may be very largely mere con-
version of assets. It is all a question of-trusting the
directors and other officers. It is no use following the
item in the balance-sheet which includes the forests, be-
cause it also includes leaseholds, mills, buildings, vessels,
rafting gear, furniture and stocks ; such as it is, it has
moved like this
1900 .. £535,393 I 1903 ..' £481,164
1901 .. 514,511 1904 .. 545,672
1902 .. 521,674 | 1905 .. 489,864
Presumably something was written off in 1904 ; yet the
item increased by £67,508 in that year—no doubt through
acquisition of plant, and probably forests. The amount
shown as written off during 1905 (as in other recent
years) is in respect to real estate and mills. The cash
position has changed as follows in five years :
1900. 1905.
Liquid Assets .. £110,699 .. £132,706
Liabilities.. .. 317,569 .. 251,258
Deficit £206,870 £118,552
Liabilities include debentures. An improvement of
£88,318 is thus shown in five years. That is the amount
which has been available after paying the dividend and
after paying for new plant, property, &c. ; but how much
has been put into new plant it is impossible to say, or
whether the aggregate amount so expended plus the
£88,318 covers the depreciation of assets.

The profits are shown after an allowance (generally very
poor) has been made for depreciation ; the further
amount shown above as written off is in respect to
certain reserve accounts. The total amount written off
and charged to profit and loss for the half-year was
£1956 ; and as the assets stand at £313,311, none of which
is cash, the amount written off is equal to only an insio--
nificant lj per cent, per annum. Apparently beer casks,
horses, and machinery, not to mention leaseholds and
hotels, are very long-lived in the West; yet to assume a
life of about 60 years for a cask does seem to be reposing
rather too much confidence in the vessel. It is possible,
of course, that other assets—properties, for instance—-
may have increased in market value ; if so, the better
course would be to openly write them up, instead of
writing them up in an obscure, indirect way, by neglect-
ing to write down other things which have deteriorated.
How long- the high values are goingto last it is impossible
to tell ; but when the gilt is off the goldfields ginger-
bread, it is almost certain that a good deal of it will come
off this and other Perth cos’, gingerbread too. The co.’s
present holding of hotels (at cost) is £153,099, all but
£18,793 of which has been acquired since 1900 '; so very ’
little of the property was bought at the low prices of the
days before the boom. The profits are truly magnifi-
cent while they last—too magnificent to justify the over-
draft of £18,099 with which the half-year finished, as
against £4220 twelve months previously ; but the accounts
leave a suspicion that some day a blue pencil will have to
be used to severely write down values.

In spite of the cleaning-up which was completed in 1904,
when three-fifths of the capital was wiped out, the
accounts don’t look very cheerful. The trouble is that,
though the shareholders might write down three-fifths of
their own capital, reducing it to £50,922, they couldn’t
write down the debentures, mortgages and other borrow-
ings ; and these now amount to £66,290. - That, as Aus-
tralia has taken a long while to find out, is the worst of
loans —they are as good as new, and the interest bill
comes in regularlv, even though the money has been lost
in a bubble or has been eaten by white ants or rust. In
this case over five-sixths of the capital and loans is in
foreclosed properties and oti.er freeholds ; and, after pay-
ing up-keep and rates, &c., these properties only re-
turn a fraction over 3 per cent. And as the loans
carry, on an average, over 4 per cent., while only
£14,315 is out in advances to help the society
along, it has to cut things fine to dodge a loss.
By getting rid of the properties on terms, the position
would show an improvement; but the net profits will have
to be four times larger than they were in the past year to
show 4 per cent.—and 4 per cent, isn’t an outrageous
return, considering that three-fifths of the capital has
been written off and no dividend has been paid since
1892. Still, it is hardly worth while mentioning divi-
dends yet, as they can’t be paid till the debentures have
been got rid of, and there are still £17,088 of “ A”s and
£26,485 of “ B ”s. Most of these “B ” debentures are
held in Scotland ; and when those Glasgow men think of
the things the six old directors of this society did prim
to 1892, they probably form their own ideas as to who the
Six Hatters are who have made capital so timid about,
coming to Australia. . .

W.A.’s Nov. gold return (163,2480 z.-) brings the
year’s total to 1,793,2240 z. against 1,983,2300 z. for all last

£280,000 better than for 1904, owing to reduced costs.

W.A. mines have declared divs. totting up

Great Boulder (W.A.) continues to have its pro-
verbial luck. Two lodes have been located by boring from
the south drive from the 1000 ft. level of Hamilton shaft.
The first, 24in. wide, is worth 40dwt., and the second,
9ft. wide, worth 27dwt. These lodes are on lease 102 E,
hitherto neglected. The finds, which are a continuation
of the Ivanhoe lodes, have not been touched so far, and
should largely increase co.’s reserves and lengthen its
life. The trend of these lodes is towards Boulder No. 1,
and should give a prospective value to those shares ; but,
at current prices, any developments are discounted.
North End, Kalgoorlie, has had a trial run of
its 15-head mill, and the result has been highly satisfac-
tory. It will now run full time, and materially add to
field’s output. At the 180 ft. level both faces are in oie
worth over 2oz. for the full width of the drive, and it
looks as if good times were opening up for the north end
of the Kalgoorlie fields. The lode is, however, irregular,
and little developed. Co. is in 200,000 shares, whit li
have not yet been marketed. It was reported that Winch,
of Adelaide, had secured an option on 50,000 at 2s. 6d.,
but this has been denied.
» * * *
Associated Northern, Kalgoorlie, was estimated
to have 89,400 tons of 22’4d\vt. ore in reserve on Sept. 30,
as against 67,000 tons worth 25'4dwt. a year ago. As
about 40,000 tons were treated during the year, 62,000
tons have been opened up, which is not bad for a mine
supposed to be worked out. At present rate of con-
sumption, mine will last 27 months at least. Meantime
anything may happen.

Golden Pole (W.A.) is not improving. In
October an attempt was made to liven things up ; but in
November they sagged worse than ever. Profits for pa t
four months have been £3700, £3BOO, £4500, and £2aoo.
Worse still, in November 600 torik more residues than ore
were treated. The oxidised ore is about done, and the
mill, much of it second-hand when the co. bought it,
can’t cope with hard sulphides; and there are grate
doubts about the filter press.

Merton’s Reward (W.A.), which successive
managers condemned as worked out, is estimated by
manager Judd to contain 76,300 tons of ore worth 305., or
27 months’ supply. Costs are put at 255., thus leaving a
profit of ss. per ton, or £7OO a month. Whether Judd is
too sanguine, or not, remains to be seen. Hitherto he
has been more successful with the mine than anyone
since Fred Merton. Judd and Kaufmann are on then-
way out together to inaugurate a policy.

Peak Hill (W.A.) has applied for six months’
exemption, and it is not certain that it will re-start. Co.
worked an alluvial deposit, and should never have been
floated according to the then existing laws of W.A. ; but
there was much influence behind it, and it went through
the laws. The wash on the surface was so rich that,
although only floated in September,’97, co. paid divs. of
£30,606 in 1898, £50,000 in 1899, and £25,000 in 1900. At
the height of the boom in ’99 shares rose to £9 ss„ and,
needless to say, insiders passed on the baby to a new
nurse. In Dec., 1903, a div. of Is. a share, or £15,000, w-as
paid even if it wasn’t earned, and since then co. has been
in permanent residence in Queer-street.

old tailings. Quite recently the 700 ft. level, which has
not been worked for years, was unwatered, and in laying
a tramline a patch was found from which 10 tons yielding
1158 oz. were broken. This happy accident led to the div.

Cosmopolitan, Kookynie (W.A.), has been
having a roug-h time, and shareholders have not had a
run for their money. A six months’tribute of the mine
above the fifth level,was let, and the tributors have been
raking in £4OOO to £5OOO w'orth of gold monthly. 7\en
a row occurred, and things came to light, with the ; jsult
that B.M. and Co. stepped in and smashed up the tribute,
and ended a very doubtful piece of business.

The electric plant of the Federal Palace Hotel,
corner Collins and King 1 Streets, Melbourne, furnishes a
good example of a thoroughly successful electric installa-
tion, in technical as well as in commercial respects. This
plant generates all electric current required for the hotel
lighting ; it consists of a 20 horse-power gas engine belted
to a “Ganz” 12 kilowatts dynamo, a “Ganz” switch-
hoard containing' all the controlling and measuring instru-
ments, and a storage battery with 62 cells. The generating
machinery runs continually during the day time at its
full capacity and highest efficiency ; the surplus current
being stored into the battery ; the latter supplies all
necessary electricity required during the night; the
battery forms also a substantial reserve in case of acci-
dents. Compared with the previous method of working a
swing' of £4OO per annum has been effected by this plant.
The contractors for this plant were The Austral Otis
Engineering Company, Ltd,, corner Hanah and Kavanagh
Streets, South Melbourne, as sole agents for Ganz and
Company, Budapest, Hungary.* , [3.]

The Policyholder (Manchester, England), of
16th August, 1005, wrote with legard to The Colonial
Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited “ Always con-
trolled in its finances and business developments by able
and experienced insurance men, the history of this insti-
tution now extending over thirty-two years, is one which
proclaims an unflagging energy, conjoined with a proper
foresight on the part of those who have been entrusted
with its acini.nistration.”*

The old plan of making a friend of the family
the trustee and executor under the head of the family’s
will is gradually disappearing ; the new plan is to get the
work done by a trustee company. Such a co. has officers
specially trained for the work, it is always available, its
fidelity is guaranteed by its capital. The Perpetual
Trustee Co., of Spring-street, Sydney, offers all these and
many more advantages.*
* * * *
A trustee co. has only one business the
management of estates committed to its charge. The
inevitable result is that, being expert in a business to
which it gives its constant and undivided attention, it
makes few or none of those mistakes which, when com-
mitted by amateur trustees, are often so costly. Nobody
knows what administration by aprivate or amateur trustee
will cost ; on the other hand, the Perpetual Trustee Co.,
of Spring-street, Sydney, established under special Act of
Parliament, has its fixed scale of charges, and the testator
knows what the cost will be. The charges are low, and
the faithful performance of the trust is guaranteed by the
co.’s capital, its reserves, and its good name.*
* * * #
The Perpetual Trustee Co., of Sydney, has
made remarkable progress in securing the confidence of
the public of N.S. Wales. In 1895 the total value of the
trust estates in its control was £2,424,413. In 1905
within 10 years—the amount had reached £5,589,194.
This striking success is the best proof of the value of the
services it has rendered to its clients. The company’s
address is 2, Spring-street, Sydney ; it undertakes all
business of a fiduciary character, and its wide experience
is placed at the disposal of testators, absentees, and
others, at extremely moderate charges.*

A 12 inch Suction Dredging Plant is being built
for the Weldbrook Tin Mines Go. The plant will be
similar in design to those erected at the Pioneer and
Briseis Extended Tin Mines (Tasmania). The engines will
be of the vertical compound condensing type of about
300h.p. fitted with an Edwards type of air pump and
large surface condenser. The boilers will be two in
number, of the marine type, and will work at a pressure
of 1501 b. to the square inch. The nozzle pump will be
centrifugal and directly connected to a vertical compound
steam engine. The barge will be 45ft. square. The
Austral Otis Engineering Go., of South Melbourne, W'hich
is constructing this dredge, has been particularly success-
ful in building these large type of suctiondredges and
owing to their reputation have just concluded a contract
for the erection of a plant in the Federated Malay States
which promises to be the fore-runner of many more of the
like.*

The British Broken Hill Silver Mining Co.,
after careful consideration of all types of boilers, have
placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 500 h.p. Superheaters, chain grate
mechanical stokers and economiser have also been
ordered from the same firm. This now makes 40 boilers
of the Babcock and Wilcox type supplied to the various
mines and industries at Broken Hill. Wherever economy
in fuel and maintenance of boiler has to be seriously con-
sidered by competent engineers, the Babcock boiler is
installed. Hence the recent unanimous decision of the
Expert Admiralty Committee to install Babcock boilers as
the standard for the British Navy.*

The strength, lightness, durability and low cost
of spiral rivited pipe have given it a place of superiority
above any other pipe. This pipe possesses enormous
bursting strength, and is protected, inside and out, with a
perfect coating manufactured from asphalt. Asphalt
coaled steel pipes have lasted from 25 to 40 years without
any sign of decay, and may last as long again. Spiral
pipe is manufactured by Mephan Ferguson, at Wanganui,
New Zealand, and at his engineering and pipe works,
Melbourne, where the latest up-to-date machinery is also
used for making boilers, fluming, refrigerators, bolts, nuts,
and every discretion of cast or wrought iron work.*
“Nothing Succeeds Like Success.” The
Hornsby “Upright” Water Tube Boiler continues its

gether 5500h.p. The Strand and Charing Cross Electric
Light Corporation of London, after similar experience,
have installed and on order over 20,000h.p., while the
Municipal Council of Finchley, London, have similarly
placed repeat orders for large installations. In Austra-
lasia, besides the 2500b.p. now being installed for the
Mount Morgan Gold Mining Coy., Ltd., further orders
have been received from both Queensland and W.A.
mines, and for factory work. Messrs. Wm. Arnott, Ltd.,
the well-known biscuit manufacturers of Sydney, and

know any more about zinc treatment than was known
already. The public had a vague idea that the new con-
cern had the solutions of all Barrier problems up its
sleeve; and it comes as a shock to the crowd that has
been buying shares and painting things red in conse-
quence to find that the Corporation hasn’t got anything
up its sleeve. The process to be used for a start is Pot-
ter’s, which has been well known for a couple of years
past, and with which one Broken Hill co. has only been
able to make a profit of about 3s. 6d. per ton of tailings,
in spite of the abnormal price of spelter. Now Broken
Hill finds out further that no big - works are going up—
merely experimental works, to begin with anyway. If it
hadn’t been for tlm boom in the metal markets, there
would have been a nasty slump in Barrier stocks on these
discoveries. As it is, the slump is postponed till the boom
breaks ; and then it will be a very bad slump.
The Zinc Corporation, and the crowd behind it
which has pushed itself into the North, Junction North,
Block 14, and South Blocks, have also managed to make
themselves unpopular on the field. The very sudden
retirement of J. R. Godfrey from the management of
Block 14 has led to some severe things being said ; sym-
pathy is all with Godfrey. And among other co.’s the
Corporation is regarded as a sort of Ishmael. It secured
lately as chief metallurgist, Les. Bradford, the chemist who
has been carrying on experiments for years with the B.H.
Prop. ; and the B. H. Prop, people made violent remarks in
consequence. Meantime Broken Hill has quite made up its
mind that the metal-markets will break presently and
that a share-slump will follow ; and it begins to wonder
what view the people who are left to nurse shares bought
at boom prices will take of the matter. In past times
when metals have slumped wages have been ground down
and mines have been unskilfully worked in the struggle
to pay such divs. as would give a modest return on the
old boom prices ; now, in several cases, share registers
have been enlarged, and the struggle will be more severe
than ever. This partly accounts for the Broken Hill
miners’anxiety to get the award under the Arbitration
Act, which recently expired, fixed up again promptly ;
they wouldn’t risk the delay involved in an appeal to the
Court, but came to an agreement on almost all points in
conference with the managers.

wide ore body has been struck), if the lode is anything
like it is at the two levels above, it will be found that„a
width in one or two places is no criterion. I was in one
of the first parties that stoped at the 800 ft. when that
level was worked from M'Bryde’s shaft ; 50ft. south of
M‘Br,vde’s crosscut a breast of 60ft. was exposed, and 70ft.
north of the same crosscut there was only 7ft; of ore in
the face. At, the 1000 ft. in Block 10 they had nothing at
Campbell’s end (south); in the centre they had 50ft.
wide of good ore on the sills, but had not gone up. very far
before they found a horse of mullock 15ft. to 20ft. wide had
split the lode. At Kelly’s (north) end they had about 12ft.
of a face, and on getting towards Block 11 boundary it
began to widen again to a bold breast. Workings on
1000 ft. Block 11 have proved the lode there to do precisely
what, it had done in IBook 10—that is, to narroyv to
nothing, open out, and narrow again ; so any estimate
of reserve based on a width at one place is moon-
shine. Bulletin (30/11/’O5) says “ the 1700 ft. north of
Delprat’s shaft is untouched below 600 ft.” Good reason
why—they can’t find anything to touch. All that driving,
crosscutting and diamond-drilling have found in that
direction is a little pyrites. Miners here are of the opinion
that there is a big saddle'of mullock splitting the lode,
and that Block 13 is on top of the saddle. If this
theory is right (and workings to a great extent prove
it), then the B.H.P.’s mine is not what it is made out
to be.

C.S.A. syndicate (N.S.W.), originally in 44
shares of £5O, passes into a limited liability co. of 44,000
shares at £1 each. Original holders bagged 22,000, and
nominally 22,000 were offered at 2s. on application and 2s.
on allotment, old shareholders having the right to take
them. Knowing that the 4s. share would be saleable at
; bout 705., old holders, of course, snapped them all. New
issue brings in £22,000, if all is called up ; but probably
bef jre the last call is made, C.S.A. will expand itself,
eit.ier by increase of capital or through selling off
“pups.” Meantime the market (especially Sydney) has
been rushing the shares, offering £5 7s. 6d. for them ; and
they are not easy to get at even that price.

The blocks south and south-west of Central
C. have been sold, allegedly to Prank Gardner, for
£2OOO. Therefore there is probably something in the
rumor that an offer of 15s. per share and one-sixth inter-
est in a big co. is about to be made for the Central. Cen-
tral shares, of which there are 1000 at the face value of
610, have been selling at between £l3 and 614. Gardner
would no doubt like the area for one big float; and if he
acquires the Central his purpose will be accomplished.
His first purchase, now known as “Gardner’s Block,” is
the key to the situation.
Mt. Boppy South, near Cobar (N.S.W.), begins
to get noticed from outside. It has an area of 31 acres ;
but parent mine, by some accident, got in a six-acre block
between the South’s leases. South has tried to buy the
sandwiched block, and has suggested amalgamation ; but
the big co. has not been friendly so far. Probably its
directors reflect from London that their co. has 290 acres
and is too big to notice a 31-acre proposition ; but very
much of the 290 acres is merely make-weight—you can
always tickle Bull with a big area. Their expert, Freche-
ville, also had his own idea about the trend of the reef, and
it wasn’t favorable to South Boppy ; hut his Idea hasn’t
been supported by the crosscutting, &c., on which some
thousands have been spent. Clemes, who preceded
Frecheville, considered the South held the extension of
the reef, and things point that way more firmly than ever.
In the end big Boppy will most likely stretch out after its
neighbor ; but by that time the South may have reached
the sulphide, and will in that case no doubt consider that
t is strong enough to float out of its own troubles.

Junction, Wyalong (N.S.W.), is brighter at the
800 ft. The four shareholders have had uphill work
through a barren zone, but at their last meeting £950
was divided to relieve the monotony of call-paying. The
first-grade ore is treated at Cockle Creek, and a further
parcel of 50 tons is now undergoing treatment. Late
Wyalong crushings include Golden Fleece, 261 tons for
870 z., and 47 tons for 240 z. The Mousetrap has been
acquired by the Fleece Co. ; price is stated to be £llOO.
The field’s output of gold for this year will fall a trifle
short of the total for last year, which was 22,0000 z.

Returns have been received from the experi-
mental parcel sent away from Irving’s Mt. Gifford, Coppa-
bella (N.S. \V.). Result: 16oz. silver, 48£ per cent, lead, 8
per cent. zinc. Gross payment was £lO 14s. 9d. per ton ;
this has to bear £3los. smelting charges, &c., 12s. penalty
for excess of zinc and sulphur, £2 ss. Id. freight; total,
£6 7s. _d. There is left to cover mining and all other
charges £4 7s. Bd. per ton. But the stuff was hand-
dressed down from between 4 and 5 tons to 1 ton. so the
£4 7s. Bd. per ton has to pay for mining between 4 and
5 tons. Certainly there are the seconds (6oz. silver, 8£ per
cent, lead), but, for the time, they must be disregarded.
On the te6t parcel there can be no profit; but as another
lot, which is estimated to go higher, is being got out, hope
hasn’t been abandoned yet.
Even Chillagoe, which hasn’t much immediate
interest for anybody but the debenture-holders, is sharing-
in Queensland’s “ wave of prosperity.” For a long- while
past only one 'smelter has been running; but a second
will soon be warmed up. Railway traffic must have shown
much better profits lately, the boring at Zillmanton has
given good results, and at the Queenslander good stuff
has been found, though it isn’t possible to say how much
there is of it. And debenture-holders were surprised
lately with some interest before .they expected it.

Charters Towers mines and market—particu-
larly the market—are on the up-grade. Latest resusci-
tation is the Columbia, to be known as the Brilliant
North. Capital £50,000, in 200,000 shares at ss. each,
80,000 to be paid up. Columbians get one paid share for
every two they hold. There are 90,000 shares in the old
co., so that will mpp up 40,000 paids. Then one coupon
share is to be given to every holder of four contribs. if he
pays calls totalling 2s. These bonus shares will swallow'
30,000. The other 5000 paids are not worth considering,
so they are g-iven to people for their trouble. It is not
well to inquire into these matters too closely. Co. will
pay out of application moneys flotation expenses. The
liabilities of old co. (£1300) are to be taken over, also the
assets. Assets consist of a 50-acre lease decorated with a
hole 1970 ft. deep, a squib of a crosscut, and two short
levels. Prospectus says the show is in the vicinity of
Brilliant Extended. Certainly, the boundaries touch,
and the stone is going that way. But it is a very long
shot, and contribs. are loaded with 3d. a month in calls,
and prospecting a long shot on calls is an uncertain
game.
* * * *
At their half-yearly meeting Manager MacLeod,
of the Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, staggered
shareholders by telling them what their property is like.
For the first time in Towers mining an estimate of ore
reserves was made public. Even now' systematic sampling
has not been done ; and it would also be worth a lot more
if tonnag-e w'ere given instead of cubic-footag-e. Co. turned
out for the six months 16,975 tons, or 4024 tons more than
in previous term. Stone all through has averaged £2l9s. fid.
per ton. The last month’s run was good, 3000 tons for
gold worth £5300, and concentrates (£3597), cyanide, &c.,
carry the total to £10,175. Last June 2710 tons
returned £7152. Total tonnage hauled was 116,360
tons, but of this 99,728 tons was water ! Develop-
ment (2696 ft.) has opened up some fine blocks of
ground, notably at 12 east and w'est, 2400 ft. deep.
Reef in this level is exposed for some 400 ft., and will
average between 4ft. and sft. of stone that the battery
says is worth £6 a ton. Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are out on large
bodies of payable stone. No. 3 underlie has been carried
down .to 524fc. No. 13 levels, east and west, are to be
started ; but they will not begin in stone. No. 7 west, a
level that has contributed very little towards the returns,
show's a big improvement. For the last 160 ft. there is
3ft. of £2 10s. stone showing. A crosscut started from
No. 4 west to intersect a rise coming up from No. 7, has
cut good stone, proving (unless the unforeseen happens)
that the rise will be in stone all the w'ay up, about 170 ft.
Half-year’s costs were £2 os. 3d. a ton ; value, £2 19s. Gd.;
profit, 19s. 3d. Nothing elaborate about the profits yet ;
still, there is hope. MacLeod, w'ho does not make wild
statements, says he can knock 7s. off costs during this
term. The three preceding- terms’ costs ran to £2 45., £2
13s. 4d. and £2 7s. Directors promise quarterly divs.,
commencing next March; and the promise is justi-
fied by appearances.
* * * *
If market activity is any criterion, Kelly’s
Queen, Charters Towers (Q.), should be choice. Co. turned
out two paddocks of stone from the foot and hanging
wall reefs. Returns when they reached the public were
lumped. Moreover, gold was in the bank for some time
before shareholders knew that 325 tons averaged
£6 16s. lid. per ton. At No. 2 shaft a crosscut has
opened up a foot of promising stone. But this is not a
new discovery; its whereabouts was known three years
ago. This show may have to be reckoned with yet,
though it is a stock that is liable to bite anybody who
handles it carelessly.

Work done by West of Scotland, Gympie (Q.),
has been taken as a test for the deep ground at the S.E.
end of the field. It was argued that the Inglew’ood cross-
course or dyke continued. If so, West of Scotland would
be on the W. side of the crosscourse, and the slate
“ country ” should therefore be found at a deep level in
it. (The* Gympie field is intersected and displaced by a
series of crosscourses running roughly E. and W., and
thus crossing the layers of country.) The shaft w'as sunk
3136 ft., and a drill lias tested the ground to below 4000 ft.,
and holes were also put in E. and W. , Still the
auriferous bed of country was not met. Co.' has thus
spent thousands without return ; and the manager, who is
just back from Scotland, has been told by his directors
that more will be raised if a favorable report can be got
from an authority. Baling has therefore been in pro-
gress, and when the mine is clear ex-Government Geolo-
gist Rands will report. Rands formerly held the view
that nothing could be expected of the country south of
the Inglewood, so the chances of a favorable report are
none too bright.
* * * •
Something is going to be done with Tartana (Q.)
at last; a tribute co. has been underwritten in Sydney'
and Brisbane—ls,ooo shares, anyway, of the 20,000 offered ;
and even if the public doesn’t take the other 5000 the co.
will be called floated. Tribute shares are £1 each ; £5OOO
of the cash goes to the old Tartana Co., which then hands
over 10 shares for each one in the tribute (Tartana is in
504,000 shares). Presumably Tartana wants the £5OOO to
wipe off its debts with. The promoter takes 5000 shares
in the tribute co., and pays brokerage and underwriting.
So far the property has given the mine-reporter
more work to do than the miner. The elder Gibb,
who overhauled it thoroughly, estimated that the
developed portion of the oxidised mass should yield some-
thing over 4000 tons metallic copper and over 160,0000 z.
silver; and his estimate of cost of production (by
precipitation) and marketing was £42 per ton. At present
prices of copper and silver, Gibb’s estimated output of
copper and silver would leave a monthly profit of £4OOO,
less royalty (£2 per ton, with copper at £5O, and moving
up slowly from that point). Quite likely the metal
markets won’t stay where they are, though the copper
market looks more hopeful than most of them ; but if
Tartana has one sort of possibilities in the way of market
slumps, it has another sort in the way of p.vritic ores,
which cap the oxidised mass. The extent of this pyritic
ore is unknown ; but there is a great quantity of it. The
old Tartana co. is a mostly Queensland concern ; the
tribute is mostly N.S.W., and will have its office in
Sydney. The tribute lease is for seven years.
Allan Gibb, late manager of O.K. copper mine
(N.Q.), has gone to Glassford Creek, outside Gladstone
(Q.). For time being he takes the place of his father,
who proceeds to Cloncurry to report for the Willcocks
Syndicate. Glassford Creek, unlike 0.K., is a low-grade
proposition at present, and is quite a baby concern.
Worked in conjunction with the Hector mine, however,
it appears to have good possibilities.

The Long Tunnel crowd comes out with the
biggest thing the Australian market has yet been tried with
in the way of tin-floats—the Oybele, whose 948 acres join
on to some of the Gladstone blocks (Tas.). Co. is in 12,000
shares of £lO each ; promoters take 6000 paid, £4500 cash,
and £3OOO out of the first profits ; public is invited to take
5000 shares and pay flotation charges ; and 1000 are held
in reserve. Assuming shares are worth what the public
is asked to pay for them, the vendors get £47,000 and the
promoters £2o,soo—latter being also just the sum avail-
able out of the £5 to be paid on application, to provide
preliminary exes and buy dredges with. L. W. Grayson,
on whose word the Long Tunnel crowd has taken the
thing up, estimates the necessary expenditure at £46,000 ;
so, as it isn’t likely the promoters will let the co. provide
plant out of profits while there is capital uncalled, people
who take shares can make up their minds that the whole
£lO will be called for. Even that will most likely not be
enough, in which case there are the 1000 reserved shares
to play with. On Grayson’s figures, Long Tunnel Dawson,
who signs the prospectus as manager pro tem., estimates
a monthly profit of £5007 10s., or £60,090 a year = 50 per-
cent. on the capital ; and his figures show 18 years at that
rate. Grayson is more modest: he puts the profits at
£750,000. Why the solid people behind Grayson and
Dawson want to give aw-ay £375,000, when all that is
necessary to earn it is to put up, say, £20,000 for a couple
of dredges, buying the rest out of profits, isn’t clear.
There seems to be a fly in the ointment somewhere.
Fact is, the estimates are based on the oxide being- worth
£9O net on the ground—say £l4O for the metal. It is past
£l5O now certainly ; but (going back 25 years) in ISBO it
was £B7 7s. Od. ; in 1885, £B6 12s. 6d. ; 1890, £O4 3s. 6d. ;
and 1895, £63 7s. Id. Between times it was sometimes
higher, sometimes lower. It 1904 the average was only
£126 10s., notwithstanding the big jump of the last three
or four years. Those who believe present high prices
have come to stay will jump at the Cybele ; it has been
well bored, and contains an enormous quantity of tin-
bearing stuff, and most of it can be cheaply worked with
bucket dredge. Those who have less faith in the tin
market will probably say that the public is taking all the
risk and not getting a big enough interest in return.
* * * *
The Anchor, Lottah (Tas.), is out of the Mt.
Lyell tin deal. It is on the wrong side of the slope—or,
at least, Luke Williams seems to think so —and so it has
to plug away on its own. Co. works a big granite-bearing
formation like that which the Lyell folk are going to
prospect. As it has 100 stampers going full swing, it
gives a better idea of what the ore is worth than all the
boring and scratching that will be possible with the
£lO,OOO that the Lyell tin “ pup ” is to expend.
For the June quarter the Anchor treated 32,026
tons of ore for 60 tons of oxide. And this
record demonstrates pretty well just what is ahead of
the Lyell combination. On one hand, rain is wanted to
give water to provide motive power for the battery ; on
the other hand, rain is not wanted because it damages
the races and makes the ore wet and sticky, block-
ing it in the shoots and in the crusher. These
are little physical difficulties that Bowes Kelly and
his friends may or may not know about, but which they
will wot of in good time. The 32,000 tons for 60 tons of
tin oxide works out so low an average that if Lewis, the
manager, can make it pay he is a wonder. There is
nothing to show that the Lyell leases contain anything
better in bulk than those of the Anchor.
* * * *
Weldbrook tin (Tas.) shares look as if they are
to replace Briseis Extended on the share market of
Melbourne. If the public is lured into buying shares
before it sees that the mine has more promise than the
Briseis Extended, it will deserve all it may get. Indica-
tions point to the making of a market in anticipation of
the starting of the plant. That was what took place at
the Briseis, ditto at the New Brothers Home, ditto at the
Gladstone, ditto at the YVyniford, ditto at the Briseis
Extended, and in every case there was a later slump.
So the wise man will be he who lands Weldbrooks into the
lap of anyone trying the game, inasmuch as there can be
no greater certainty than that he will be able to buy back
at a considerable saving.

“Macqui”: Re Lyell Blocks (B. 23/11/’O5),
these are the figures. For past three months 5000 tons
copper-bearing clay treated _ per four weeks for 70 tons
fine copper, equal to a saving of 1-4 per cent. As the
clay is valued at about 2 per cent, on an average, this
shows an extraction of 70 per cent. How many concen-
trating mills in Australia are doing as well? The soapy
schist spoken of is the old sulphide lode worked by the
old co. about three years ago. The present workings are
in clay, not schist.

Bull’s spirits are rising a little as to Vic. deep-
lead mining; and well the3 r might, when the Duke
United and half-a-dozen other earlier shows in which his
cash is sunk pass like phantoms before him. Obviously
inspired paragraphs in the Melbourne.dailies tell of fine
prospects at the New Havillah and Charlotte Plains
mines, where Drysdale Brown’s crowd has beaten the
water and got into the wash ; and now comes the story
of Sin. square of wash giving so many dwt. This is all very
nice ; but prospects don’t make a mine. If they did, on such
an estimate the Bank of France wouldn’t be in it with
Brown’s shows in the matter of gold reserves, taking
width and length of the lead in the two mines into
account. Runs of gold are very tricky, beaten only in
that respect by the prospects got from bores. It happens,
too, that a drive will often hit a patch, while the blocking
will give a tally immeasurably lower. This is not said
carpingly, for apparently Brown and his friends have
worked hard and spent cash freely, but the experience at
the Main Leads and other mines shows that often there
may be acres of wash and only a very few feet of payable
dirt. What surprises the grey-heads is that the gold is
coarse. How it could be with all the glacial conglomerate
intervening is a little puzzle which the pick will have to
disclose.

Catherine Reef, Bendigo, has given the wise
set a cold shiver. Up to 84s. one day, at 655. the next,
and then flop to 50s. Two poor yields did the trick after
one or two good ones ; the wiseheads concluded that all
the talk about the rich spurs was flam, that the scrip was
a fair Aunt Sally mark, and so let go. Their shying
brought forth a statement from manager Ooakes, and the
board took the unusual step, for Bendigo, where they
prefer to let the mine speak, of publishing the remarks.
The position seems to be that the west side of the forma-
tion carries low-grade stone, and the late crushing coming
from there showed up badly. The best gold is in the
spurs on the east side of the formation. North the face
is 40ft. wide, and south 20ft. wide, and Coakes goes out
of his way to tell shareholders not to get alarmed. He
intends to shut down during the holidays to connect new
plant, and he wants to timber up and put his mine safe
before stopping work. He is an old-time, solid, and not-
to-be-bustled sort, but he knows his work and knows his
mine. So to-day the issue is narrowed down to this :
whether the Catherine Reef development is the big thing
he and his people believe, or whether the gold will only
be found near the break. Whether true or not, an indus-
triously circulated rumor that Mueller had cleared out a
lot of scrip had a depressing effect.

Surveyor Cundy has come out with a report on
the North Argus, Bendigo, which shocks the management
by telling it that, instead of pegging away east, it ought
to go west in order to pick up the main track of the
centre country ; also it ought to sink the shaft another
100 ft. to strike the downward continuation. This advice
recalls the story of one of Lansell’s early successes. He
had an idea that in one Bendisro mine all the work was in
the wrong direction. So he bided his time till he could
nibble in a commanding interest; then he kicked out the
old board, put in his own nominees, drove west instead of
east, struck the reef, and got over £50,000 in divs. in a
long way less time than it had taken him to buy the scrip
in for the calls.

Dredging is the one profitable mining industry
at Bright (Vic.). A score or so of dredges are in full
swing, owned in Vic., N.S.W., and Maoriland, and not a
duffer among them. Latest to come on to the div. list
is the Maori Queen. This co. once owned pretty well all
the flats towards Harrietville, but it was a frost for years.
Its last foolish act has been to sell its Freeburgh‘lease,
which some Melbourne folk bought for £lOOO, and
promptly floated into a £6OOO co. Ladies generally prize
their jewels, but the Maori Queen seems to be an excep-
tion.

Dear Bulletin,— ls the A.M.P. Society run by
Chinamen? I received a letter last week from somebody
signing himself Thomas Littlejohn, asking me to sign a
proxy form which leaves a blank line and no instructions
how it is to be filled. In the letter one of the
reasons given for extending the Society’s business to
South Africa is : “The British South African colonies are
being developed by people of our own race and tradi-
tions.” Damn it! Ah Littlejohn may be a Chow, but
I’m not, and I resent being called one by the society into
which I pay my good red gold every quarter.—Yours, &c..

Price, Waterhouse and Co., the London
accountants, were engaged some months back to go over
to the U.S. and find out, if they could, just how the
Equitable Life Assurance Society does stand. A cable
now says that their valuation of assets and liabilities
gives the society a surplus of £13,797,859. That is to say
the society has this amount in excess of the sum necessary
to meet its policy liabilities ; and this sum is available for
bonuses. lhe official valuation was about £3,000,000
more than this ; but even £13,797,859 is a very tidy sum.
In considering- the vast size of American offices’ sur-
pluses, it must, however, be remembered that they issue
a very large number of policies on a 10 and 15-year profit-
distribution plan, and, while these policies are maturing,
their share of profits is not divided or even ear-marked.'

“ Snell : A few years back a prospecting
party, mooning about north-eastern Victoria in
quest of reefs for the English market, struck the
hut of a quaint recluse. He was about 40, and
astonishingly hairy, with an enormous outcrop of
whiskers. He wore a coat made from a potato-
sack, and the fragments of a pair of moleskin
trousers. He was sufficiently sane to run an
excellent vegetable garden and control a herd of
goats, but absolutely refused to recognise the
existence of his visitors. The strangers questioned
him, but he remained silent, and his eyes passed
over the faces and figures of his unbidden guests
without a hint of recognition. The fact that the
party camped at his hut, ate his potatoes, and
roasted one of his kids had no effect upon the
shaggy hermit. At the back of the hut of this
curious crank was a small structure of rough slabs,
foolishly built and capable of being upset with a
shove, but with a massive bullock-chain and great
padlock securing the ramshackle door. The recluse
was noticed stealing cautiously to this place, and
when he had entered and closed the door after him a
miner sneaked up and peeped through the cracks.
Tiie hermit was kneeling before some object not
distinguishable in the gloom, praying fervently in
gibberish—or at least gibbering fervently. After
the crank’s third visit to his chapel, a digger, for
mere idle curiosity, leaned up against the struc-
ture and overturned it. The god of the recluse
was a cone-shaped outcrop of beautiful white
quartz richly studded with gold. The Idol reef
subsequently panned out a small fortune for the
proprietors, and meanwhile the hermit was quite
content with an imitation of his original shrine
set up in another part of his garden.

“ Galena ” issues a challenge to De Rouge-
mont: —
Von Kotze wrote in a recent Bum,t.tin of the man who
was treed in New Guinea. Bet me tell of a wors e horror that
befell me. Was on the wallaby in Tasmania when a furious
gust of wind and rain sent me for shelter behind some big
trees. Here I made a pleasant discovery. One of the
trees was hollow. I squeezed through the opening and
stood inside dry and comfortable. I worked my swag in,
and with a little manoeuvring managed to sit down. Then
I dozed off, and dreamed that I was in the cab'n of a
schooner on a raging sea. The gale increased, and the
vessel pitched and tossed, until with a mighty crash she
struck a rocky shore. I awoke, dazed and half-stunned ;
I was lying in some cramped space in inky darkness,
powerless to move, and hardly able to breathe.
Gradually the truth came. The gale had uprooted
my tree, and it was now lying prone, with the
opening underneath, and I was inside! I then
found that I had earth instead of wood beneath
me, and with my knife I tried hard to dig my way out,
only to find that the ground was as hard as flint, and that
even if I could penetrate it, there was no room for the
excavated stuff. Its hardness puzzled me. I struck a
match and examined it. Road-metal ! I reflected that,
since my tree had evidently fallen across the road, I
must soon be rescued, for the road-men would have to
remove the obstruction. So 1 waited patiently and one
morning a few'days later, a familiar rasping noise awoke
me. I could faintly hear voices, and called out again and
again. The sawing went on, however, and then terror
smote me. Not hearing my shouts as they worked their
great cross-cut, the road men might saw me in two with
the tree ! I lay waiting until some grains of sawdust fell
on my neck. With a frenz ed effort I retreated inch by
inch, till I found that the sawdust was falling beyond my
head. Then the blade snarled its way through.the hollow,
and was withdrawn. With laboring creaks andgroans the
black mass rolled away from my prison, and with a yell I
forced my head and shoulders into dazzling daylight.
The sawyers are running yet.
About a
sensitive
bloke :
They were
discussing the
latest murder.
“ Why do I pity
him '/ ” sa i d
Harry. “ ’Cos
I pity any bloke
wot does a mur-
der. I know
what the feelin’
ismeself.” This
speech fell like
a bombshell in
the slian t y,
and one man
dropped his
beer on the
floor.
“ I’ll tell yer
how it hap-
pened,” he con-
tinued. “You
know Colling-
wood ? Well, I
was with a girl
in Studley Park
opposite the
flour mills,
about fifty
yards from the
river. I forget
exactly how it
was, but some-
thing I did or
said riled her,
and she got up
saying she
would throw
herself in the
river. I put it
down to over-
doses of Bland
Holt. When she
walked towards
the water I
laughed and
barracked like ;
but 6he goes
out of me sight
and down the
bank, and I was
just thinking
she was carry-
ing the joke a
bit far, when—
‘Splash 1’ I
rushed over in
no time, and
saw the ripples
on the water.
I’m a sensitive-
feeling sort of
bloke, and I sat down on a rock as miserable
as a bandicoot, for I thought somebody ’d sure to
have seen us go out together. I can tell you I was feeling
pretty bad about it, and was wondering which way to
sneak home, when, bli’me, I saw her hiding behind a tree.
Then I dropped.; she must have shoved a rock in.”
“ I guess you were glad," interjected some one.
. Ye s, I suppose I was,"Harry replied somewhat doubt-
fully ; but I was as mad as a hatter at being made such
a fool of. So I cracked I didn’t see her, and kept sitting
a few minutes ; then I lights me pipe and strolls off. I
hadn’t gone far when I heard her yelling: ‘Yer ’artless
brute ! I ain’t in, and yer wouldn’t care if I was.’ Them
unjust remarks hurt me, considering how I had worried •
so I waited at the top of the cliff above the falls and
then pretended to shy her down the precipice. ’ She
screamed like an eagle. We made it up on the way
home, I don’t mind telling you that I was a bit shook
on her, and if she had drowned herself I would have been
dead miserable for a couple of days. J always was a sen-
sitive sort of bloke.”
“Republican”: Tears ago Smith, now
dead, made a home in the scrub of N.Q.
At that time no one but Smith would
have lived there on his own, on
account of the niggers; but he had
a strong slab hut, with 2in. auger
holes commanding a view of all
parts of the surrounding
scenery. Occasionally the
niggers got home on him for
sweet potatoes, and sugar
cane, and things ; but
Smith discouraged them
by potting a few and
sticking their heads
around on the garden
fence. Nothing dis-
gusts a nigger with a
place quicker than a
skull on a post, even
if it belongs to one
of his own tribe.
He’s a bit super-
stitious about
dead skulls. One
day a gorgeous
traveller came
along, and reck- t
oned he was col- t
leeting specimens ,
for a museum,
and he offered
Smith £lO for
a good mummy
blackfellow. Smith
knew of a few
buried up in the
trees close handy,
but found that
they were spoilt
by the wet season
that was then on.
However, he pro-
mised to have one
ready by the time
the eoi lector got
back from Clon-
curry. He had
some trouble in
securing one with
a shot-gun (a bul-
let spoils them),
and he took the in-
side out, and stuffed
it with dry grass, and made a sapling platform up
in the chimney and put it there to season. We
were coming down to the coast, and called at
Smith’s for dinner. He had shot a couple of
birds, and had made soup of them in a kerosene
tin. It was good soup, but Daintree Dick asked
Smith [The rest of the story of Smith is
unpublishable.—Ed. B.]

Crowds flocked to the Westralian Agricul-
tural Show, held lately for the first time on
the new grounds at Claremont. Over 22,000
travelled by train alone, and a fair estimate of
the attendance on the principal day was 30,000.
But as to exhibits—well, this was what was said
by the West Australian, which has been fran-
tically booming agriculture for years past:—
The exhibition of good breeding stock was not up to
the standard of former years, and the brood mares in
.particular were wanting in quality.. . Last year there
was considerable competition in young horses, and gene-
rally the youngsters were of a better class. In this year’s
show there are but a couple in each section... Small
and uninteresting exhibition of agricultural produce.
The classes, chaff) truss straw and hay, and sheaves of
hay, failed to attract any entries... Competition in the
remaining classes was limited... Display of dairy pro-
duce was an exceptionally poor one... Butter was mostly
Victorian, or from N.S. W., and so were hams, bacon, and
cheese... No entries of extracted honey, comb honey,
comb foundations, or wax... Much valuable space
allotted for the display of honey, etc., was left idle...
Vegetables could only be considered second-rate.
Yet, according to Bigjohn and other patriotic
Gropers, Westralia is the finest agricultural
country in the Commonwealth. Ten years ago it
was predicted that Bunbury potatoes and Nor-
tham flour would be exported to the Eastern
States, but agricultural and dairy products are
Still imported to the extent of over a million per
annum, and oranges and lemons from the Medi-
terranean are being brought in by the shipload.
Westralia has an enormously costly Agricultural
Department, bigger than that in N.S.W. or Vic-
toria, but very few farmers. The Bulletin sug-
gests that the officials drawing big screws should
peel off their coats and start producing some-
thing. With onions recently at Gd. per pound,
there should be a chance of turning the army of
lecturers, inspectors, under-secretaries, directors,
demonstrators, and others of inferior rank to
good account.

E. J. Brady writes :
“ Ed.” in Bulletin (16 11./’O5) speaks feelingly of the
goanna. I sympathise with him in his hatred of that
uncouth, carrion reptile. I was at Pilliga, camped in a
deserted hut alongside the Namoi, writing verses. Boy
Frank had gone into town for something, leaving our
frying-pan with the cold, reproachful aftermath of that
morning’s breakfast caked thereon in oleaginous hoar-
frost. In the middle of my inspiration I was wakened
by an industrious noise in the fire-place. Turned round
and perceived—with the immediate horror no man is
proof against—a six-foot reptile within touch of my boot.
In the second psychological moment I knew him fora
goanna—and harmless. But, with a thorough appre-
ciation of the situation’ on both sides, he readied for the
door. I grabbed my revolver lying, as it happened, on
the sawn pine table in front of me. Now, if there was
one vanity I could plead guilty to in those days, it might
be a pride in correctly pumping lead out of that little
shooter. As the horror streaked through the open door
I fired—with malevolence and bad intention. The “ go.”
proceeded—unhurt. I sprang after him. There was a
coolabah tree 20 paces from the door of the hut, and as.
the “go.” took his first grip of the bark I fired again.
He swung himself round to the opposite side. I bounded
forward. Before he had reached the first limb I emptied
the third cartridge. He merely poked a forked, derisive
tongue at me, and sought a higher altitude. Thereafter,
as he went skyward, I raced round and round the coola-.
bah and shot the remaining chambers at him vainly. I
was so grieved, annoyed and hurt in my pride and dignity
that I did an utterly unsportsmanlike thing. I loaded
my shot-gun with a No. 8 cartridge and stalked him
crouching on the topmost limb. He fell with a tired,
philosophic thud, and his hide was full, of ticks. It is the
one criine of my life that I am not sorry for.
LOVE'S SACRIFICE.
SHE: “ But when we get married something
might make you stop loving me."
HE: “ Look here, Liz , if you was to break your
right hand so’s you couldn't milk, I'd love
you still."
“David H. Richards”: I was drifting
along with an idle song through the aisles of
woodland trees, when a strong perfume as from a
tomb came borne on the gentle breeze. It was-
so great it seemed to state that something there
was dead. I smelt awhile, then with a smile,
thus to myself I said: “Ido surmise that near
me lies (thought fathered by a wish) dead and
defunct that gruesome crowd whose motto is
Stinking Fish!” But soon I found, dashed to
the ground, my hopes ; for (Oh, Hosannah !) when
round I sought, I found ’twas nought but a dread-
fully dead goanna ! But still I pray for that
fairer day when I can shout right hearty, in
numbers brave, above the grave of the Great
Decayed Fish Party.

“Jimmie Pannikin ” : The camel nuisance
is beceming very pronounced at Broken Hill. The
Impounding Act does not give the Inspector of
Nuisances power to gather in an animal found
straying on private land or land held under lease.
Again, the Act does not allow of an animal’s being
impounded between the hours of sunset and sun-
rise ; but the offending beast may be detained at
any hour and on any day, and driven to the
nearest pound between sunrise and sunset. Huf-
ferers allege that Abdul Sooghee Bhag, Ram Jam
Tinn, Mueka Turban Singh and Gholab Fez per-
sistently let their camels loose after sunset. Cer-
tainly the “ships of the deseit ” roam rounj
freely at night, destroying gardens maintained in
spite of awful handicaps, upsetting out-houses,
tangling up clothes-lines, creating havo'c generally
—but the ungainly brutes are religiously driven
into camp before sunrise. Hence the sanitary in-
spector would have to watch all nighf if he
wanted to impound a mob of these destructive
devils, and the job would be a dangerous one fora
person who was not a “hooshta” expert. One
night recently a herd of camels ate up a garden
and the contents of a clothes-line. Then they
tangled themselves up in the line, which was
hitched to a fence and the door of an outhouse,
and fled, groaning horribly, with these buildings
trailing behind them. The fence was found lialf-
a-mile away, and the outhouse was discovered in a
gully, but a camel with a door attached is sup-
posed to be still fleeing towards Cobar.

M‘.Coll, M.H.R., has brought back from
Yankeeland some ideas about the cultivation of
drought areas, which he has submitted to the
Victorian Department of Agriculture. The scheme,
recommended by one Professor Campbell, of
Nebraska, consists simply of deep subsoiling, the
aim being to impound the water in rainy seasons,
and keep it until it is wanted in. the spring.
Evaporation is greatly reduced by the layer of
loose earth, 2ft. deep, above the damp area, and
it is claimed that, in the arid central States and in
California, fruit crops have been brought to per-
fection with an annual rainfall of only 12in.
IJnfortunately, half of Australia doesn’t get lOin.
of rain, and in much of it the soil 2ft. down is too
porous to hold water, and in a great part of the
interior the 2ft. of loose soil on top would all
blow away in a drought year. Still there may
be something in the idea.
THE HARVESTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It is anticipated that this year’s wheat yield will be
nearly equal to that of last season, The prospects are
excellent in nearly every district.” —Agricultural Report.
Prom the edges of the Mallee,
. From the stretches back o’ Bourke,
You can hear the bushies rally
As they start their yearly work.
For the yellow swells are glistening
As the zephyr softly purrs,
And the ears of w'heat are listening
For the harvesters.
For the drought’s no longer lurking,
And the harvest vast is won,
When the silver rain is working
With the glowing golden sun.
For, when brain and hand are proffered,
Nature never baulks or errs ;
So her leagues of wheat are offered
To the harvesters.
Now the smiling sun is shedding
Blessings in his rays replete,
He’s the parson at the wedding
Of the water and the wheat.
While the soil has fed them steady
With a force that naught deters,
Till the wheat is ripe and ready
For the harvesters.
Ev’ry steamer on the rivers
Tows a trailing, wailing fleet,
And each engine throbs and quivers
’Neath the barges deep in wheat;
While each truck, with ceaseless humming,
To the gaping port transfers
Golden grain that’s surely coming
From the harvesters.
And afar, they’re calculating
Through the hunger that they feel,
On the waving wheat they’re ’waiting
For their eager, meagre meal.
While with sweeping bow and pliant
To the breezes it defers
Till it falls at last, defiant.
To the harvesters.
So they move in line, achieving
Brightest prospects of the year
In the tracks that they are cleaving
Till the acres wide they clear.
While the suns are slowly waning
And the gearing clicks and purrs,
All the ears of wheat are straining
For the harvesters.

Vigilans” : Wyndham, the last townlet
°f Westralia, may well be called “The Dead
linish.” No town or district in Australia is
cursed by monopoly like Wyndham. Three men
absolutely own the place. Pub, store, butchery,
agency, cattle-yards, all belong to them. Three
miles from Wyndham they have another pub.
They charter most of the steamers, boss the cattle
ring, and own the country right up the Ord, and
right out to the Victoria River; employing
mostly blacks. By appearances they also have all
the money. No money is in circulation, except
tjieir paper in sums of ss. up to £5 (locally called
“shin-plasters”). “On demand we promise to
pay by order on our bankers the sum of one pound
sterling.” No bank is mentioned. An immense
amount, of this paper is in circulation; in fact,
you can’t get any other money, not even from the
post-office. They are making money in every
conceivable manner. They boss the Roads Board,
run the Mechanic’s Institute, and handle the
Government grant. The only thing they don’t
run is the contract to supply the gaol with bread.
A Chow does that.

The tale of a dog :
“ Talkin’ about dogs,” the stranger began, as he leaned
against the bar and lighted his pipe, “ I reckon I oughter
know somethin’ in thet line. I had one thet was a kind
o’ barkin’ dictionary. Fact I’d have him yet, only a queer
kind o’ accident happened to him.”
“ How’s that? ” the crowd asked, as it sipped its beer.
“ It’s like this,” the stranger went on. “ Thet dog had
brains, an’ sorter hankered after a bit o’ schoolin’, lie
was always swallerin’ books an’ them thar newspapers,
what no one else swallers, an’ he seemed to like ’em. At
last, I begins to think’twouldn’t be a bad idea to give
him a bit o’ schoolin’ on me own, an’ so I starts an’ teaches
him the alphabit. ’Twas simple enough. 1 used to grab
him by the paw an’ make him draw letters on the floor o’
the hut. He got the hang o’ them quick, an’ could soon
draw anythin’l wanted. Then I gets him on to spellin’,
an’ it wasn’t long before he could spell anythin’ I asked
for. I used to sit an’ smoke, an’ put questions to thet
thar dog, an’, s’elp me, if he wouldn't scratch away on the
floor an* spell out the answers. We used to have some
good talks, an’ one day I starts him on the job o’ spellin’
thro’ the Bible. Before he’d got thro’ Exodus he’d worn
both his front paws off an’scratched a big hole in the
floor o’ the hut. He got very quick at scratchin’ out the
letters, an’ then one day he gets killed.”
“ How?” the crowd asked) as it called for more beer.
“Well, a chap calls to see thet dog, an’says it can’t
spell. The way that bark factory scratched cm-s words
on the floor when he heard this was great. Then the
idiot says as how thet dog can’t spell ‘unparalleled.’
Well, the dog spells it right away, an’ the cove says it’s
wrong. Then, to prove he’s right, the dog makes a
spring at the shelf where I keeps me dictionary, and pulls
a case o’ kerosene down on him, breakin' his back in two
places. After tryin’ to offer up a prayer with his back
leg he pegs out.”
A ROUGH PASSAGE.
PHITTS : “ Thort you said yer was a rough-rider?"
CHIBBS : “ Great Scott I aint this rough enough?”
“Elmore”: Have never yet seen in
Bulletin, mention of a Madame Melba billycan,
well known among Victorian swaggies. Term
originated at Colbinabbin station, where large
meat-preserving works were once carried on, but
proved a failure. Mitchell (Melba’s dad) bought
the works, and every swaggie who was short of a
billy would call at the station and select one to his
liking from the thousands of empty tins lying in
the shed. A hole in each side and a bit of fencing
wiie for handle made a billy that any old tramp
would back to boil quicker than an ordinary one.
A RARE FOWL.
LITTLE BILL: “Ere, gran'pa, look at the funny bird. He's got hair on he's fearers, so
he must be a lizard."
“Orthos” : I have a bird which I was
told would whistle, talk, or imitate anything. He
won’t talk, and I have elephantiasis of the
lips through vainly striving to teach him to
whistle, but he can bark to perfection. Constable
X. asked: “Have yer registered yer dawg?”
“Ain’t got one,” I said; but as Jacko from the
rear was just then barking vigorously, the Law
went away unconvinced, and later on another
“ John ” called. “Jacko” was howling as if the
whole street was dead. “Is he registered ? ” “Is
what registered?” “The dawg.” “Ain’t got
one.” “ Then what’s that ’owlin’? ” “My bii !.’’
He, too, wouldn’t take it in, and at last the ser-
geant sneaked round the back with a now-I-got-
ver kind of air. Jacko was in the kitchen, yelp-
ing furiously, but when the sergeant peered in, the
bird shut up like an oyster. Next day I got a
summons ; and while I was trying to convince the
Hibernian beak that the only dog I owned was
a bower bird, he cut my eloquence short with
“Tin shilliix’s an’ costs ! —an’ rigisther the baste
immediately ! ”

“ W.A.F.” : Going oufc-baclc some time
since, I saw a tattooed aboriginal, and a curious
exam pie he was. He was
done in designs all over
at all angles, and looked
a sort of maze. On his
chest I noticed, in large
letters, “Nelson” and
“ Australia,” also designs
of cricket bats, stumps
and balls. On his back
and arms %vere such say-
ings as “Good Luck”
and “Success,” with
horse-shoes and sundries,
including the usual hands
across the sea. Inquired,
and found that the
tattooing was done by a
sailor some years back.
I was just admiring the
work when Billy held out
his hand. On the palm
was tattooed “Thrum,
mate.”

“ F.H.R.” : One of
the greatest abomina-
tions, as far as the travel-
ling public is concerned,
is the Asiatic. Not that
he shouldn’t travel in
trains, for he invariably
pays his fare; but he
doesn’t pay his bundles’ fare. One Chinaman or
Hindu takes up as much room as a family from
Bargo. I saw four Chinamen in a railway carriage
recently, and they and their bundles completely
filled the compartment. If a white man took any
excess luggage into the carriage he would soon
hear of it; still, he must put up with being crushed
between a huge chaff bag and a calico-covered
package the size of a circus, when he meets Ah Foo
and Ram Bosh in a railway carriage.

“ W.P.8.” : Can any “ Abo.” reader
identify the species of the dark-winged moth that
recently swarmed along the N.S.W. coastal dis-
trict? Also at the same time there was here
(Newcastle district) a plague of blowflies—big,
sluggish brutes that gave one the creeps. Then,
with the hot weather, both pests disappeared sud-
denly. Whereto?
A letter from Yam Creek (Northern
Territory)
In 1873 gold was first discovered in the N.T. by the
overland tdegraph party at the Shackles, Yam Creek.
Captain YVestcott ma i.aged for the first co., the Northern
Territory Cold Mining Co. Captain Douglas, the Govern-
ment Resident at the time, brought over the first batch
of 200 Chinamen from Singapore, in charge of Dr. Gowie.
These coolies were hired out to mine-owners at 2s. per
day. They shammed sickness, and ultimately became a
nuisance. In the next five or six years about 20,000
Chinese flocked into the Territory. How much gold they
took out of it will never be known. Old resident's
put it down at tons. In 1883, Millar Bros, had the
contract to lay the Pine Creek railway, which was
done with Chinese labor. To-day (1905) the country is
deserted, except for Chinamen and a handful of whites,
while Palmerston is practically in yellow hands. The
drones; the sloths and the diseased remain ; and this is the
labor they depend upon to develop the country ! Had
those 20,000 Chinamen been 20,000 Europeans, there is no
gainsaying that the Territory would have been one of the
most prosperous parts of Australia, instead of a deserted
wilderness. Palmerston would have been a thriving sea-
port, with a railway right through to YVinton or Bourke.
A dock, with ship-building yards, and a coaling station
would have been in evidence, and the three hotels
and two stores would be replaced by rows of
shops and other buildings. Now the Chows
have the rows of shops. Pine Creek would have
had meat and other works, and farms would have
flourished in the locality. There is no settlement of any
kind. You could not sell 109 bullocks in Darwin to-
morrow. There is not a single farm in the whole of this
immense country. Brock’s Creek, Yam Creek, Union and
Pine Creek, the back country mining townships, are mere
collections of Chinese hovels, with a few scattered houses
occupied by white men. These Chinese towns are stag-
gerers. Mostly built of grass and old iron, thev are the
filthiest dens of iniquity in Australia. Blacks live
amongst and work for the heathens for a smoke
of opium or a drink of “samsin.” Immorality is
rampant. Young children openly solicit. Opium is
the curse of the place ; the blacks will do anything
for the drug. " “ Samsin ” is sold at 2s. a bottle.
The wet season is now setting in, and the blacks are
flocking into these Chinese hovels in mobs from the Alli-
gator and other rivers. At Yam Creek dozens of niggers
are camped in a defunct battery. Each one has one or
more piccaninnies, which are traded to the Mongolians.
There are no alnr ginal reserves in the Territory, and prac-
tically no protection. Dr. Fulton, of Palmerston, is Pro-
tector in name, but he has no power. He is allowed £5O
per annum.
AN ADVENTIST’S ADVENTURES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Seventh Adventist stayed the night
At Wheeler’s on The Gap ;
He was an agent, but, despite,
A very decent chap ;
So o’er the Bible, after tea,
To recompense for board,
He told from ancient prophecy
The coming of the Lord.
At midnight, yea, as if in proof
Of what the man had said,
Ten cats upon the iron roof
Did howl to wake the dead.
Then he who of the “ Coming” dreamed,
Awoke a little scared,
And jumped from out his bed, and screamed :
“O Lord, 1 am prepared ! ”
Old Wheeler was awake, and sought
Relief in language blue ;
He heard the stranger yell, but thought
That he was swearing too ;
So to the g'ood man, who, with groans,
Was waiting for his crown,
He shouted : “ Get some blanky stones
And knock these ten blanks down.”

Harrington’s Photographic Warehouse, at 386
George-street, Sydney, is just now assuming a great
briskness of trade, which it is very pleasant to observe.
Requisitions for cameras, large and small and of different
grades ranging in price from ss. to several guineas, are
daily increasing. Doubtless a large proportion of these
will take the form of Xmas gifts to many favored persons.
In view of the approaching holiday season, too, some
thousands of packets of plates, films and papers are pass-
ing over the counter to a multitude of photographic
aspirants. Altogether the business being done at Har-
rington’s is pitched m a high key of enthusiasm telling of
Christmas, holidays, picnics, &e., and we may well anti-
cipate an enormous multiplication of summer photo-
graphs long ere the first month of the new year has
passed.*
Horse and Hound.— People are always trying various
new things for their baths, but to really refresh one
nothing comes up to Scrubb’s Cloudy Ammonia, it being
far and away in front of everything that I have yet come
across as a pick-me-up when tired after shooting, hunting,
or what not. Quite excellent, too, in every respect, is the
Antiseptic Skin Soap supplied by Messrs. Scrubb, and I
strongly recommend it from personal experience.*
The Fed. Govt, did not drop the Anti-
Trust Bill with such alacrity because they’d lost
their faith in the ability of D.C.L. Whisky to
urge willing minds to desired ends. But against
a combination of ill-will and unwillingness even
D.C.L. counselled a waiting policy. The Whisky
of The Wise is a spirit of discretion, and its
devotees do nothing rash.*
His Mother’s Advice.
After Years of Suffering from Indigestion,
Mr. Bdair is Cured by Mother
Seigel’s Syrup.
“What appears to me the longest period in my
life,” writes Mr. A. P. Blair, of 94 Pilgrim Street,
Footscray, Victoria, in a letter dated January
23rd, 1905, “is the three years that I suffered
from indigestion. I was then in the grocery busi-
ness, and there is no doubt but that my illness
arose from my lack of exercise in the open air.
“ I became depressed, and was so run down and
fagged that every duty was a trouble to me. As
I was more often than not unable to retain food, I
became extremely weak. I also suffered "from
insomnia and headaches, especially in summer.
When I succeeded in my effort to keep a little
food down, it would be like a leaden weight on my
chest or cause intolerable pain in the stomach.
“My general health was very bad, and of all
the various medicines I tried none did me any
good. As time went on, and my condition grew
steadily worse, I began to despair. After I had
endured this misery for three years, my mother
urgently advised me to try Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup, a medicine to which she attributes her
own excellent health. When I had used the
Syrup for a little while, my appetite showed signs
of revival. I was again able to retain a moderate
quantity of plain food without the usual retching
and vomiting, my tongue was cleaner, and I was
no longer troubled with an acid, bitter taste in
the mouthi Headaches were a thing of the past,
and natural, refreshing sleep was mine once more.
“ The wonderful curative properties of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup surprised me. To that medicine
alone is due my complete cure, for during the last
six and a half years my health has been perfect. ?

surmounted by a small boy vainly trying to
break a bundle of sticks ; and it plasters the
design over its offices and its literature in
great profusion. The other day, when
Joseph started out on his great Secesh
movement with a pop-gun, Joseph’s life
assurance society put scaffolding up
against the small boy who was trying to
break the bundle of sticks at the top of
the building, and people thought the boy
and the motto had been getting on Joseph’s
nerves and were going to be hauled down
and thrown into the cellar. But nothing of
that sort happened. Joseph, in his busi-
ness capacity, just ordered the small boy
to be given an extra coat of paint, and
the “Union is strength” motto to be
printed in gold and made a trifle more con-
spicuous. Joseph is thus a versatile person,
who can preach that union is strength
from the roof of his office and that dis-
union is strength from the basement.
Henry Campbell - Bannerman, a
heavy, ordinary man whom Nature plainly
intended for something respectable in the
retail grocery, is the new Prime Minister
of Britain. Ordinary—incurably ordinary
—is Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The
only name he could really live up to is that
of Samuel Bloggs. He is a relic of the old
Gladstone days; Freetrade is his god, and
Cobden his profit. But this prosy old man,
by constant mention of such words as
“liberty,” “justice,” “freedom,” “ex-
pansion,” and so on, has climbed in his dull,
heavy way till he is at the top of things, and the
Brixton empire looks to him for its salvation.
Apropos of that Thibetan Buddha and
its marvellous likeness to a distinguished member
of the N.S.W. Bench (8., 7/12/’O5), it haslongbeen
wondered where Justice G. B. Simpson got
all his marvellous stock of dignity and wisdom.
At last the secret is out—G. Buddha Simpson,
the god incarnate.
The chief reason of an Australian civil
servant’s sensational downfall is said to have been
a big Bourke-street (Melbourne) hazard school
from which he one night took away £5OO. One
night, and one night only. The other nights he
left hundreds with the professional members of
the school.
Henniker Heaton has taken a K.C.M.G.
—the bauble of nigger princes and casual mayors.
It was always understood that his price was at
least a baronetcy, but then Henniker’s friends
were going out, and the vista of probable years
before they get in again looks long, and Henniker
isn’t so young as he was before he became as old
as he is now.
The conduct of an Australian minor Judge
is gossiped about, at the expense of the Bench’s
shattered dignity. A crooked elbow is the whole
cause. Awhile ago it is alleged that his Honor
had a riotous and drunken night with a quantity
of defendants, and next day balanced himself care-
fully on the bench and began giving judgments
in their favor with such velocity that “the Grown”
presently withdrew the rest of the cases. His
Honor, it is said, saw three Crowns, and appealed
to the.two outside ones to go on, but they refused,
and withdrew along with the middle Crown.
CHARITY AWAY FROM HOME.
JOVIAL REFORMER : “A ticket to Kyabram, young
feller, and, as you're very obligin', yer’d
better 'ave one yer self. "
The memorial edition of John Farrell’s
verses brought in a profit of £6B odd; and, as
Angus and Robertson handed back their half-share
of publishers’ profits, the total available for the.
deceased penman’s family was £137. The com-
mittee had its final meeting last week; and,
as the memorial edition was limited to 250 copies,
it had reason to be well satisfied with the result.
W. M. Arnold—known among some as
“ Wanting-Memory ” Arnold—was before N.S. W.
Bankruptcy Court the other day for a scathing
lecture. Years ago he retired from the N.S.W.
civil service as an invalid, suffering from want of
memory and other symptoms, and drew a pension
thereafter with pathetic regularity. Also, he
spent his invalided time in business as a share-
broker, and amused his leisure as a Rugby football
umpire. Altogether he was a most interesting
sufferer, and now he comes again before the public
eye as a bankrupt, who has been refused a certifi-
cate with even more than the usual emphasis.
THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER.
Bravely he rode—and well;
Into the jaws of death—
Into the mouth of .
Where does Australia find itself with regard
to Protection now that the session is practically
finished?
The late Baronet O’Loghlen, in addition
to his poor little £1228 worth of goods, left a
widow and ten.children —five boys and five girls.
The successor to the title is named Michael, after
the first holder, his grandfather, and is 19 years
of age. The widow is the daughter of a wealthy
Melbourne leatherware merchant who flourished
in the sixties.
Judge Homburg, of S.A., is not a rapid
calculator. The other day a solicitor appeared
before him, and asked to be allowed costs on an
estate of £2OO at the rate of 5 per cent. Learned
Judge: “Five per cent! Too much, Mr. So-
and-So. I will make an order for £20.” Solicitor
went no further into the matter, but took his 10
per cent, and was thankful.
Governor Belmore, whose old city mar-
kets keep the Sydney Corporation and the
Government at loggerheads, was a bit of a
market gardener himself. Cabbages, car-
rots, and parsley were specialties with
him, and, before sending them into
the city for sale, he used to fix th 6
lowest prices with his carter.
Some days half a load would
go back, and the Earl would
be hard to live with for a
icouple of hours. He was
an unaggressive man on
almost all subjects except
: home-grown vegetables'*
but over them he was
ready to wrangle on
the slightest provoca-
tion. His wife, a
niece of W. E. Glad-
stone, lived in
horror of market
days and her hus-
band’s wild anger
over an unsold
g lettuce.
x No man in Australian
public life has changed so
much in personal manner
as John Forrest has done
in the last ten years.
Fifteen or twenty years
ago he was a hard worker,
unobtrusive, silent, almost
secretive. 11e wAs regarded
as pliant rather than head-
strong. It was the good
he had done as an explorer
that gave him a place in
public estimation. When
to that claim was added
the knowledge that he had
amassed wealth, his posi-
tion was assured. But those who knew him in
those days saw nothing which portended the
bluff, heady, guffawing, bounder-mannered Fal-
staff of the present.
“O’F.” : Queen Victoria is not quite for-
gotten. The other day the legal luminaries of a
suburban court condoled with aJ.P. on the loss
of his wife, and received for answer: “Thank
yer, gentlemen ; thank yer kindly. It’s a ’orrible
lorse. Still, there’s the consolation of knowing
that Ilemtna—my good lady, I mean—died at just
the same hage, almost to a hinstant, as our late
beloved Queen ! ”
Since his elevation to the leadership of the
S.A. Libor party, Archibal 1 lias developed a
regrettable loqu icity. He appears to consider it
his duty to make a long speech on every possible
occasion. Recently when the E irly Closing Bill
was about to be put to tlie voici s, he jumped to
his feet and talked the opportunity away. The
Bill would have passed then, and delays are
always dangerous.
Attorney-General Isaacs’ pugnacity appears
in his gestures. When warmed into vigorous
argument, he removes his pince-nez from his nose,
and whirls it rapidly up and down like a man
using a meat-chopper. Somewhere in Isaacs’
ancestry there was a man who used to hold a
tomahawk as their descendant holds his glasses.
And the hairy persons who entered into negoti-
ations with that ancestor used to find him a most
convincing gentleman in debate.
An interesting incident in the life of late
Fredk. Lord Claye, solicitor, of early Melbourne :
On being given his articles by Swain and Co., one
of the oldest legal firms in London, he took the
office seat just vacated by Benjamin Disraeli, who
had determined that the law had no attractions for
him, and had gone forth in the famous green
velvet pantaloons of his early literary days, also
in his scent and his bangle, to sparkle along the
paths of fiction.
Jas. Bywater Humphreys, who died in
Melbourne, the other day, at the age of 50, was
manager of the Simpson’s Road branch of the
National Bank when, about eight years back, it
was stuck up. The robbers were in possession of
the premises before his arrival at 9.50 a.m., and
promptly secured him and got at the cash with
his keys. Humphreys was afterwards transferred
to the branch at Swan-street, Richmond, but
things did not go well with him for long. The
directors finally gave him a free trip to the Cold
Country and retired him.
Bendigo ex-teller Gray, alleged to hare
stolen 2100 sovs. from his bank, has been acquitted
on one set of charges at his third trial. He is
being proceeded against on other charges. Stated
(though unofficially) that the Crown intends to
proceed with charge after charge. Many Vic-
torians contemplate apprenticing their sons to the
profession of jurymen, for Gray’s case promises
permanence to the industry.
Australian Governors seldom do anything
striking in the political line after their supposed
enlarged experience in Greater Britain. Their
usual course is to become guinea-pigs, or fade out
in gilded leisure. Carrington’s inclusion in ajlive
British Cabinet is therefore something notable.
Belmore did a little in Imperial politics; and
Hercules Robinson, as Lord Rosmead, did more ;
but they were exceptions.
E. G. Fitz Gibbon may be fairly termed
the father of Municipal Melbourne, for though
Wm, Kerr was its first town clerk, Fitz. was the
man who wiped out the old publican alderman
and councillor, and brought in the pick of mercan-
tile Melbourne to assist him. In-the old council
of the fifties were such men as Gallagher, who
kept the Rose of Australia in King-street; Cos-
grove, who had the Fitzroy Arms in the same
street; Bennett, of the Globe in Swanston-street;
Hughes, a sodawater-maker ; and Storey,
originally a night-contractor, and afterwards a
publican. These, and others like them, mostly
did municipal business in the back parlor of
Councillor Jordan’s Rainbow Inn, at the corner
of Little Collins and Swanston streets. In the
early sixties came Butters, Mowbray, Bayley,
E. Cohen, and men of that stamp, who first made
Melbourne move ahead.
Billy Wamba, of the Gulf, is the only
Kanaka squatter in Australia. As a stockman he
stuck to his cash, and after a while he got a herd
together. Then losses fell upon him, and he had
to make a fresh start, so he went further out and
leased Gum Holes Station. There he met with
considerable success, and, marrying an aboriginal
lady, he now has a family and a comfortable home.
According to repute William has a solid bank
balance and is not above giving a job to a decent
white man of industrious habits.
The recently-deceased Ralph Copeland,
Astronomer Royal for Scotland, resided in Vic-
toria from ’53 to ’5B. It was while looking after
Malcolm M'Farlane’s sheep, like the Chaldean
shepherds of old, that he began his astronomical
stud ies.
Vic. Premier Bent last week resumed his
old habit of hurting himself. A while ago he was
addicted to slipping down or falling off, but this
time he got into trouble whilst ascending the
companion ladder of the Government picnic
steamer Lady Loch. Bent hanged his head
against an iron bar, and had to retire to the cap-
tain’s cabin for some hours whilst the pain was
wearing off.
Deceased E. G. Fitz Gibbon was to the
city of Melbourne what the late John Rae was to
Sydney—a Town Clerk with authority over his
official masters. Rae, though sporting the silk
glove, carried the ironbark hand of Fitz Gibbon.
Both drew a portion of their power direct from
the Governor-in-Council, and that fact helped
them much in their pursuit of autocracy. Aider-
men in Sydney and Melbourne in the early sixties
were demoralised incompetents, and although it
was a bad system which turned the clerk into
boss, it was the only practicable one at the time.
Rae was Scotch and Fitz Gibbon Irish born, and
their many years of tempestuous fighting with all
sorts lengthened their lives.
Thomas Archer, ex-Agent-General for
Queensland, who died recently in London, was
born in Scotland in 1823, and came to Sydney in
1837. In 1841, with his brothers John and David,
he started from the Castlereagh with 5900 sheep
for the Moreton Bay district. They passed the
present dividing line between N.S. W. and Queens-
land near the site of Goondiwindi, crossed the
Cohdamine somewhere below Canning Downs,
pushed on through the then practically unexplored
Darling Downs to Eton Vale, and crossed the
main range at Hodgson’s Gap. Then they moved
on through virgin country to Durandur, on Stanley
Creek. There they halted, and during the next
four years did a lot of exploring, and took up two
stations by the main range. In 1848, Thomas,
accompanied by a white mate and a black hoy,
crossed to Jiinbour, and got to Fitzroy Downs.
Later on he explored the upper Burnett, and dis-
covered and named the Fitzroy River. He settled
in England in 1878. He was twice Queensland’s
Agent-General—between ’Bl and 84, and 88 and
’9O. Dramatic critic William Archer is his son.
THE LATE EDMOND GERALD FITZ-
GIBBON, OF MELBOURNE.
Photo, by Alice Mills, Melbourne.
“Melb.” : The late Fitz Gibbon’s service
as Town Clerk of Melbourne from 1856 to 1891 was
unique and splendid, but he ought not to have
been appointed chairman ,to the Metropolitan
Board of Works. Life has no second spring. He
had put in his first-rate 35 years, and a new man
should have been secured while Fitz. could have
gone on as long as lie liked as city clerk. The
finances of the Metropolitan Board are not exactly
a scandal, but they are a muddle, and the task of
righting the ship is much more difficult than that
which M’Eacharn, Gillott, and Clayton contrived
to face when the city finances got tangled up,
three years ago, through the similar reason of a
good financial man being kept in charge past his
time.
MAX HIRSOH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Max Hirsch, acting 1 on the advice of his doctor, has
decided to leave Australia at the end of the month for
Europe, and his friends propose to take advantage of the
occasion to entertain him at a dinner.
There’s a sudden burst of tears from Flinders Lane ;
There’s a snuffle right along Importers’ Row ;
Their stomachs all are heaving with the tumult of their
grieving
For Maximilian Hirsch has got to go.
Would you know the inward reason of their pain ?
Why the family of Sargood sit and weep ?
They have lost a foreign servant who was faithful, fond
and fervent —
And they’ll never get another man as cheap.
A restless little man of many arts,
Who from Foreign-trade allegiance never swerved —
He would not desert the alien for the sake of things
Australian,
And he hardly got the pay that he deserved.
For the Fatmen held him warmly to their hearts
Till he loved them and forgot his Single-tax ;
But the mungo-men he boosted on their money-boxes
roosted,
And they rarely paid a dollar out for Max.
I watched him slowly drift from bad to worse,
Saw him perish as a decent democrat,
For his text in recent sermons was “Australia for the
Germans ”
And the masters whom he served were always Fat.
So I’m writing him this valedictory verse,
Ere he sails away across the spacious foam.
I am sorry that he’s sickly, but I’m glad he’s leaving
quickly,
And I hope he ’ll find a steady job at “ home.”

Rev. Charles Wincott
WRITES :
“Gentlemen, —About three years ago I
was confined to my bed for a short time with
a very acute attack of Liver complaint.
After other medicines had failed to take any
effect, I was recommended by my doctor to
try Kutnow’s Powder, and I am glad to say
that after taking two bottles I was com-
pletely cured, and my health has been
better ever since. I have since .recommended
your excellent preparation to quite a number
of sufferers, who testify of similar results.
“(Rev.) CHAS E. WINCOTT.”

“ I prescribe Kutnow’s Powder and take
it myself occasionally ; it never fails to bring
about the most gratifying results in the most
pleasant manner.”
Sir J. B. MONCKTON
(Late Town Clerk of London) wrote :
“Guildhall, London, E.C.
“ Gentlemen, —I have much satisfaction in
stating that for the last two years I have
regularly used Kutnqw’s Powder, with the
result that troublesome and frequent attacks
of lumbago, with other gouty symptoms that
had troubled me for years, seem to have
entirely disappeared. ’ ’
THE FOOD PASSAGES
and ORGANS.
The body is a working machine, and like all other
machines wears away in use. Our bones and muscles, so firm
and strong, need constant repair to keep them so. For this
purpose food is necessary, and a series of instruments or
organs by which it may be changed into flesh and bone. We
are, therefore, furnished with teeth to chew, palates to taste,
stomachs to digest, livers to aid digestion, and bowels to carry
off the refuse matter. The Liver is the very gateway of
health, the sewage farm, where the poisons are neutralised by
the action of the bile ; it exerts an all-powerful influence on
the mind, temperament, and disposition. If your Liver is
active you are happy and light-hearted, if sluggish you are
crabby and miserable. Kutnow’s Powder will keep the
liver in perfect order.
Important Caution I
All respectable Chemists sell Kutnow’s Powder, but there are others ,
who, for the sake of a little extra profit, will attempt to foist upon
you some cheap imitation of their own. It is well known that
these cheap concoctions are highly dangerous, and in the case of
delicate, sensitive persons capable of inflicting permanent injury.
Kutnow’s Powder is pure, painless, palatable, free from sugar, and
absolutely harmless. See that the fac-sirnile signature, “S. Kutnow
& Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade mark, “ Hirsehensprung, or
Deer Leap, ” are on the carton in which the bottle is packed, and
also on the label on the bottle. This signature and trade mark
will alone insure your obtaining the
GENUINE Kutnow’s Powder.
CAPTAIN BARCLAY™,
“Kirsteen, Cisbury Road, Brighton.
“ Gentlemen, —You kindly forwarded me
a bottle of your Kutnow’s Powder a short
time ago. I am very unwilling to testify
that things have worked wonders, but really
I cannot speak too highly of it. I have
suffered for years from constipation and liver
troubles. Your powder has done all that it
claimed, and more than that, it has given me
comfort. Its action is sure and gentle, and
at the same time certain, without any dis-
tressing effects.—Faithfully yours,
“R. BARCLAY (Capt.).”
Dr. Tertius Marks we™,

A ssociation ; Medical Director of the Q.A.R. of
the Department of Texas, Ex-Pension Medical
Examiner, U.S.A.)
“ Having tried your excellent preparation
(Kutnow’s Powder) personally, I am in a
position to say it is as good as it is possible
to conceive.”
Dr. I. N. LOVE
WROTE :
Late Professor of Clinical Medical Diseases,
Marion-Sims College of Medicine and College
of Physicians and Surgeons, says :
“ Kutnow’s Powder stimulates the activi-
ties of the bowels and kidneys, it cleanses
the bowels, dilutes the urine, and flushes
out the kidneys in the most satisfactory way.
Thorough elimination is salvation, and there
is no better eliminator than Kutnow’s Pow-
der. “I. N. LOVE, M.D.”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ Sydney, December 19, 1905.
My Dear Arini,—
Our State is practically in mourning for Lady
Rawson. This generation of Sydneysiders never
had as its society official head so beloved a woman
as she. Gentleness, charity, and tact and sympa-
thy they were all hers in full measure. “ Our
adts our angels are for good and ill,” so the
deceased lady’s memory will live long in ours;
and the angels,” all white ones, are innumer-
able. Governor Rawson will arrive at the end of
this month, and will finish his term of office. He
wishes to land as quietly as possible, and will
come to Rose Bay, leaving the liner for a steam
launch, and go almost immediately to Sutton
Forest. His private secretary and Mrs. Harrison
Smith leave for that objective this week.
Mrs. Jack Want and her daughters have taken
a house at Darling Point. Mrs. Edward Knox,
her three daughters, and Mr. Noel Stephen are
off to Tasmania presently. So are the Forbes
Anguses. Young parson Ashley Teece takes
charge of the soular system of a parish outside
Hobart. His fiancee, Miss Giblin, lives adjacent.
Mrs. Lachlan Beaton and her children are at
Katoomba. Mr. Austin Chapman and his wife
are off to the Postal Conference at Vienna ; so are
the John Hughes pair; and these departers’
elegantly situated and furnished houses’’are to
be let.
Fpr the hundredth time, the husband is a
marine product. Mrs. Langloh Parker, who has
written so much nigger lore, met Mr. Stow, the
man she has just married, at sea. He is a member
of an Adelaide firm of solicitors. She is dark
charming, and moderately adiposey.
Miss Venables, matron of the Children’s Hos-
pital, is returning to Sydney from London. This
tact is nothing compared to the information that
she is bringing out two woollen petticoats “creamy
m tint, worked by the Princess of Wales, to be
presented next Empire Day to the two youngest
girl inmates of the R.A. Hospital for Children.
Ihe market value of the garments is probably
eighteenpence each. Mrs. Charles Fairfax sends
them out Hope they are insured. And if the
liner should founder, Miss Venables will only do
her duty if she fastens a life buoy to the petticoats,
-then she may drown in peace.
Radies of Premier Seddon’s family were right
“ “ ont ’ d ,unng recent elections. Stalwart
Miss Mary and her sisters escorted their old man
around the polling booths of Wellington, and
were lavish with smiles and bows. “Pa dear” is
by no means persona grata with the would-be
aristocrats of the wooden capital, and this preiu-
dice had not a little to do with the return of
young Fisher for Wellington Central, and the
defeat of the Government man. Many women
made no secret of their intention to vote for
-b isher because he wore such nice ties and was so
good to his mother. O’Regan, the beaten man,
was presumably just as good to his maternal
progenitor. Anyhow, no one ever saw him
walloping her. But then his profile and his ties
were not “subtle.” Besides, Fisher cantered
around everywhere with his mother and sister,
and didn t hide his domestic virtues.
A memoir of the late Mr. Want is being written
by a barrister friend of his.
Thirlmere Home fete, in aid of the Consumptive
Home for Women, is running at Sydney Town
-nail like a bush lire before a hot westerly At
the opening, Dr. Sydney Jones got off his usual
wheeze about one-seventh of the human race
being carried off by the great white plague.
Dr. Sinclair the man who out-generals the cun-
mng bacillus at the Wentworth Falls Sanatorium
freshly brilhantmed his hair and his top hat
ana ran down for the ceremony. At Mrs. .T. c!
Williamson s stall sat Tittell Brune, and signed
photographs of herself on a strict- cash basis
lhat dandy little parson, Rev. North Ash, bought
one for 12s. 6d. It carried, as well as the Brune’s
signature, the line from “Merely Mary Ann”—
‘God made me.” A soured amateur read it over
the parson s shoulder, and added “ When He had
nothing else to do, I suppose.” Thus do malice
and envy burst forth when least expected.
• r^? ere s a giG in this city who always appears
in the latest hat or skirt, or sundries, a week
before we read in the imported fashion notes that
that kind of hat, or skirt, or sundry is the Latest
or the Just It. She must have a watchful and
prompt friend under Northern skies. Other day
she was wearing a deep berthe of tiny crystal
beads, which may be taken as the coming garment
which casts its glamor before it.
I notice by the cable that Edward VII. has
struck disaster again. The corpse of a ' bird
dropped dead on his head while he was out shoot-
ing, and his Majesty’s cranium was shockingly
decorated with gore and feathers.
New flagship, the Powerful, looks a well-
manned vessel. He (I suppose a man-o’-war is a
he) swings at anchor in Farm Cove, all French
grey, his men swarming about like the innumer-
able caterpillar, his numerous tons or more of steel
displacing a lot of the Cove’s water, and his fight-
ing tops and torpedo tubes, topgallant forecastle
and poop, armored decks and sailors’ laundry out
to dry, all there. The British Government hasn’t
cheated us, so far as I can learn, in the quantity of
material. At night, with tiers of lights—long
lines of low lights, and higher lights, and lights
aloft like stars, and a half-mile of drifting smoke
on the heavy air—the majestic craft looks for
all the world like a section of Mark Foy’s hydro
at Medlow. Report says that the single officers
on board have clubbed and bound themselves by
vows not to marry Australian girls. Well, the
making and breaking of vows is easier work than
say climbing up the Powerful’s smoke-stack’.
And the clubbers don’t know the Australian girl
i , d t 0 beat - Perhaps Mrs. Juliana Fawkes
the Admiral s wife, will be more tolerant of lovers’
vows than was her predecessor.
Talking of Medlow: If you want to realize
what Browning felt when he wrote “My Soul
smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroli fresh -
enmg and fluttering in the wind,” go and find
yourself up the Blue Mountains when there’s a
wet wind blowing and all creation looks like the
first wasli-in of a Payne’s grey picture. You your-
self rolled round and round with hurrying pearl-
grey clouds, and the gums and hill summits
darkling through the fog and receding as a dream
recedes. You’ll feel as if the world was draw-
ing back, taking its light with it and
leaving you alone, a wildly joyful spook on the
verge of the cliffs that shut' in the valley. It was
all better than amber weather and gentian-
colored skies. And the hurry of those clouds to
get down the valley ! One hour it was as a chalice
filled with purple wine—the next it was packed
with dimpled mist. “The silence of the place
was like a sleep” until the voices of certain
Hydro-tourist women broke in talking of dress
and describing, on the note of F in alt, vignettes of
foreign travel. “ Talk about style in short skirts !
I 11 never forget that skating-rink in Paris as long
as I live. _ Real ice, and half the leaders of French
and English society racing round, or waltzing, on
skates. The loveliest short frocks, barely to the
ankle, and scores of yards of underskirts in shaded
silk. . . Countess of Warwick was there doing the
lightning act on skates. She was all in ermine .”
A voice of another color broke in with something
about the Champs Elysees (“ Billy calls that the
‘Chance of Eliza’”), and the next instant they
had intruded into my cloud and were talking
about the Alhambra Music Hall. “O, mention
of the Alhambra reminds me of the impertinence
of some Sydney people when they are abroad.
If they just barely know you by sight here,
.and you run up against them in London, they’ll
behave as if you’d been brought up in the same
cradle. One night I and Ted stopped to look at
a woman coming down the stairs of the Alhambra.
O, she was a flamer ! A white brocade gown with
a lot of jewelled net and a great crimson theatre
coat of brocade with a huge Medici collar and
diamond buttons. Just as Ted was saying ‘ This
is a roaster,’ she caught sight of us, niade a dash
at me, took both my hands and screamed ‘O, you
dear ! you are from - darling old Sydney. Come
and see me—you must come to see me. What do
you think ?—a duke is keeping me now !’ I had
never before seen the dreadful creature in my
life.”
Concerning Maoriland items of little import-
ance, a correspondent tells me that Pearl Grace,
youngest daughter of the late Dr. Morgan S.
Grace, Count of the Holy Roman Empire, is
engaged to be married to a Mr. Dalziell, a partner
in the firm of Findlay, Dalziell and Co., bar-
risters, of Wellington. Bride has money and
looks and other good qualities, and, although her
future husband is not of the same faith as herself,
the Church consents and will wave its vestments
at the wedding ceremony. The Grace family get
their money from the maternal side. Grandfather
Johnston, who was one of the earliest arrivals in
Wellington, had a most successful calico store
in that City of Many Shocks. “Count”
Grace, who died a few years ago, was a
Maori War veteran, and shortly before his death
published an amusing book of war reminiscences.
He was a surgeon, attached to one of the British
regiments, and his book made other veterans—
brigadiers, and generals, and things— very wroth
by its criticisms of their methods of campaigning.
Said methods often so amused the “rebel”
Maoris that they used to leave off fighting to
laugh at the enemy. Those were the days when
the British soldier was supposed to dress himself
in bright red and give three cheers, and then try
to approach the enemy quite unobserved.
“Sylvia Blackston, contralto, with kind remem-
brances,” are the words of a card to hand from
the bright little Sydneysider. Note that she
sticks to the contralto, Emily Soldene to the con-
trary notwithstanding. Emily generally knows
what she’s writing of when she opinionates on
music (and food), and she says Sylvia is now a
mezzo-soprano. The French maestro has made
this change. But Sydney musicians always
asserted, in private at least, that Sylvia ought to
be a mezzo.
Miss Theodosia Britton, who left the staff of
the Australasian to run the “ Woman’s Page ”
of the local S.M. Herald, is to be married shortly
to Mr. Wallace, a man in the Civil Service of this
State.
Now, who is Madame Carlotta Reynal ? She’s
been telling the Chicago musical interviewer that
she was the principal mezzo-soprano of the Belle
Cole co., and that when the co. collapsed she
wrote for the press :
Editors proved only too eager to buy her brilliant con-
tributions. In a year Madame Reynal had added largely
to her bank account, and this enabled her to plan a song
recital tour through Australia. Her only companions on
the journey were her small son, aged four, and the faith-
ful horse on which mother and infant rode between the
little settlements in the Bush, as the wilderness in Aus-
tralia is called.
I fancy I see Madame, her infant, and moke doing
the journey between, say, the two little settle-
ments Tocumwal and Jerilderie.
Miss Marie Narelle arrives in Sydney soon
and will sing under the agency of flautist
Leinmone.
Announcement of Miss Vinia De Loitte’s
engagement to marry Mr. Howard Vernon is a
surprise. Pretty Vinia is only 22, and Vernon,
even if he doesn’t look it, ought to be old
enough to be a grandfather. Her relatives
entreat and weep, but the bride-elect says the
Voice will Breathe soon after the arrival of the co.
in Melbourne. She is an only child, and her
father died a few months since. Miss Ruby
Adams, who is one of Sydney’s belles, is a first
cousin of Miss Vinia de Loitte, and she also has
a singing voice of more than average charm.
Mr. Robert Farrell, who'was for twenty years
engaged in the export trade of sheep, cattle, and
frozen produce in this State, and whose business
was crippled by the drought, has succeeded after
hard experience in establishing himself success-
fully in South Africa. He is on his way back to
look after the edible beast importation trade. His
wife has been prominently associated with
women’s movements in Sydney, and is hon.
secretary of the Women’s Branch of the British
Empire League.
A lady lately sued Dr. Howse, V.C., of Orange,
for £lOOO damages, the reason assigned being that
he had burnt her feet badly by deputy to keep her
out of heaven. At least, that wasn't exactly how
itwas put, but it may be condensed that way.
She had collapsed during an operation, and had
been revived by hot-water bottles when she was
practically dead—scalded back from the gates of
Paradise, so to speak. Evidence proved (1) that
the doctor did not own the private hospital where
the event happened, and (2) that the patient was
bottled by the nurse—not by the doctor. The
jury awarded her £5O, but there will be the usual
appeal. By the way, I know of two other cases
of this parboiling of lower supports by hot revivers
during unconsciousness. Only in the “other”
cases the damage was done by loving relatives
in the sufferers’ own homes.
Recently-deceased Hugh Junor Browne, of
Melbourne (father-in-law of Alfred Deakin), was
converted to Spiritualism by the American
medium, Charles Roster, who, visited Victoria in
’72 and took away many shekels. To most people
who had interviews with him, Foster was a very
obvious impostor, but Browne never wavered in
his spiritualistic faith. Whatever Deakin’s views
on the subject were, he kept them dark after he
entered political life. The greater part of
H.J.B.’s considerable means was derived from a
cargo of sugar vvhicn he imported from Mauritius
at a time of scarcity in Melbourne.
A treatise T shall write in the days when I get a
nib to suit me will be “ The Pursuit of the Medical
Man by the Amorous Clamorous Female.” More
than any other class of professional quarry is the
medical man stalked by the unquiet sex for the
purposes of (1) holy matrimony, (2) blackmail, (3)
plain mash. But as most medical men are mar-
ried and marry fairly early, and very few
women know how to blackmail, the amorous
clamorous female usually pursues for purposes of
plain mash. She stalks her doctor hot foot.
If sickness keeps her in bed, then does she assume
the pale-blue silk robe, inset with lace and fas-
tened with jewelled pins; or the white one, run
through with rose ribbons. “A doctor is a
machine.” Go to ! He is a man first,
cause enough, he may also get an attack of plain
mash. After he has mended her fading form,
surely he may repair her spirit’s broken shrine.
With his piercing insight he’ll discern that she
and Jack are a mis-mated pair, and in conversa-
tion the topic of personal relations usurps that of
symptoms.
It is a rarity to find a woman who has not at
one time or other gone daffy on a medical man.
According to rumor, certain Macquarie-street
physicians must be half their time making a des-
perate stand at their last ditch —or, if they haven’t
a ditch, at the trench where the Gas Co. has torn
up the street. Somewhere and somehow Mrs.
Humphrey Ward has put it in print that woman
eternally prostrates herself before thd man who
can do without her. She was, I think, speaking
of a priest or a priestly personality. If priests
were more men of the world, if they had a manner
(manner is more than manners), and if they
weren’t so thick in the neck, red in the face and
elementary-handed, their lives wouldn’t be worth
living because of the pursuit of the amorous
clamorous female.
The Most Pursued in the medical man hunt is
nearly always a specialist or a consultant physi-
cian. He has personality as well as professional
skill. Sometimes he is a Brute. Knew one in
another country. Wherever he went he was
pursued by a lady, the joyless mother of many
children. She was for ever dropping on her
knees before the medicine man and exclaiming,
“ Let us poison ourselves.” Usually he said that
that wasn’t his day for taking poison, and that he
only died on Tuesdays and Fridays, but finally he
gave her a written list of poisons with accurate
directions for taking the fatal dose. Next time
she rose in his path he shouted, “ What—why are
you such a procrastinator ? ”
Besides the Brute there is the Pursued who has
a Manner, a nice taste in tweeds, a voice that
reminds the stalker of a harp played with muted
strings, and the glance of a Grand Inquisitor. He
is a conscious actor, and sometimes enjoys the fun
of flight because he can admire his own skill in
doubling. But whether he is Brute or anything
else his stand at the last ditch against the plain
mash is only humorous to the onlookers. I must
certainly write that treatise.
This queer yarn appears in the Barrier
Miner
When W. P. Crick was Minister for Lands, he visited
the Barwon and West o’ Darling- in 1902, and planted a
tree in the Menindie Park. The tree flourished until the
opening of the Lands Commission in Sydney, when it
commenced to droop. When W. P. Crick was brought
before the court and committed for trial, the tree died.
I have often noticed myself how the vegetables
that are associated with us sympathise with our
financial disasters. Almost every time I lose
another umbrella, which happens about three
times a week, one of my pot plants gives up the
ghost.
Someone sends me this notice of a ball from the
Maori part of Maoriland :
Notice, Waikirikiri, Nov. 18th, 1905. Dance Waikiri-
kiri. Ball going to start. To be held at Waikirikiri on

There is a vigor and energy about that notice
which makes me think that the brown people
enjoy themselves.
Lea Park, the palace build by late champion
Wild-Catter Whittaker Wright, has been con-
verted into a hydro. The description of its

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 18, 1905.
Mr Dear Yarrie,—
The Vice-Regals are constantly getting mixed
up in the institutions they look through from day
to day, and wholly incongruous sentiments are
put down to them. Last instance was a visit paid
by Dame Northcote and her Countess guest to
the Children’s Hospital, when the pair expressed
great pleasure at what they had seen ! Of course
they didn’t mean that the children were an en-
joyable and entertaining sight to behold, or any-
thing of the kind ; but the sentiment is recorded
by the press without explanation. One of the
superfluous Aides ought to be told off to prepare
fit sentiments for every occasion so that the Vice-
Regals are not misled into remarking that the
brick-laying was a matter of deep regret and the
hospital visit a source of much merriment.
The last superfluity to be attached to the G.-G.
staff is one Kerr-Pearse with the usual military
prefix. This attachment is an attractive young
party with a foreign air, or at least a romant o
blackness of eye and hair and an upward kick of
the moustache that passes for such.
The young feminine relatives of the Stonington
Ex. seem to suffer from scanty wardrobes. Miss
Grosvenor was particularly thrifty about her rai-
ment. The present Miss of the hyphen is almost
as poorly clad. Toorak now wonders if it is
aristocratic to look as if one’s pin money didn’t
supply any luxuries. Up to now the Cream has
reckoned it a cardinal virtue to look extremely
prosperous, but the Talbot relatives, by their
cheap dressing, are causing Toorak a profound
think.
There were two droll features about the chil-
dren’s spree provided by the Northcotes as a last
flutter for the year. One was a solemn procession
of dog at the Exes’ heels what time the long file
of boy and girl started to wend its way towards
the dais—doggie taking up an effective pose beside
the Vice-Regals during the burlesque of a recep-
tion. The second droll circumstance was the
figure of the R.C. Archbishop—plumpest advocate
of patriotism and population in this State. The
G.-G. took the church dignitary in tow whilst
reviewing the somewhat joyless juvenile shivoo.
Probably the two childless personages talked in an
exalted strain concerning other people’s progeny.
Th epater fnmilias with a quiverful never enthuses
any on such occasions. His views on the birth-
rate are patent to all.
Nothing more stilted or less mirthful than that
kiddie corroboree could be imagined. The young-
sters blubbered, sulked, and kicked against orders
in most instances. Only the feeble, mild, pitiful,
characterless sort did as it was told, bobbed to
order, ate to order, laughed to order, and never
once raised a rebellious note against the mummery.
The aides had to carry out the work of corner-men
—burnt-cork vaudevillers. They had to wheedle
the sulky along, play the buffoon for the whim-
perers, dance the unwilling into a perspiring heat,
rescue the house dog when he fell within danger
of wicked heels, and generally behave as the
clowns of the party. The Northcote dame begged
the mommers to help the Idds to bon-bons. Miss
Ruby Madden, chubbier than any babe, circled
softly about the place. Miss Stuart-Wortley was
the one grown-up who unaffectedly polkaed with
the short-sock youngsters and enjoyed the
spree. Commander Dent, looking like Charley
Ryley doing his second time on earth, wore clothes
full of travel creases, and was a lion amongst the
Toorak doves.
Rev. Wheeler, the young cleric who succeeds
the touring Rev. Sugden as Argus music critic, is
a pet of the Northcote Dame. He was lassooed
in at that juvenile show a week or two ago, and
made an impression on the assembled dames as a
sweet young man of the croquet-muffin order.
Local singers, however, don’t regard him as any-
thing of the sort. A pedant in a parson’s collar is
the common or garden verdict. The Argus has a
growing taste for the cloth, but the cloth has
no real kinship with art.
The putting-up of the State Parliamentary
shutters for the recess was accompanied by the
usual blare of brass band and flourish of rooster
trimmings. The few chiffons shown in the Council
Chamber act were as naught compared with the
Buchanan plaidies and kilts, and towering head
muff, or the Buxton tartans and the long angry-
cat s tail of a brush in his war-cap, or the shining
brasswork and plates of a swarm of high-grade
Tommies flanking the dreary Governor. Himself
wore a row of medals on his robin red breast, and
droned out his shutter remarks in a voice too tired
to mark the full stops or to retrace a passage in
which the tongue had wearily blundered. As a
proroguer, the Talbottle is a rank failure.
Mrs. Speaker Madden’s te a party saw a crush
and a scramble for the buttered scone. No extra-
vagance about the spread or the decorations.
Everything done on a plain, thrifty scale. The
Talbotess wore white muslin with fresh-air ridges
in the yoke and sleeves, also a severe black
feathered hat. No compromise about that style
of head-gear. The Dowager of Cliveden wore a
postscript bereavement rig and a large gold heart
on her chest.
A long-winded engagement matured recently in
a street where crowds of Melbourne’s very naicest
live and move and have their stretchers. The
man and woman had a few words over the length
of the engagement, and made a sudden resolve to
get married. They sent for the parson forthwith,
and were fixed up right away, with the best
blessing of the lady’s mama and papa. Then the
unblushing bride rang up all her good pals and
told them she was a wife, so that they shouldn’t
call her “Miss” when they met her in the train.
A widow f rom another State is doing large
damage just now among susceptible males. The
report goes that she is engaged three deep already,
and the end is not yet. One finger is insufficient
to bear this white widow’s burden. The engage-
ment rings are all over her tapered hands, and
any future ones will have to be worn in the ear.

Word comes along that the widow of merchant
Frederick Sargood and her young chick are both
doing Veil in the Cold Country. The Miss in
question has been polishing up her top C and
training her fingers in the way they should dance
on the wary keyboard. None of the Sargoods
have been music-mad, but the Rippon Lea shivoos
were noted through a stretch of festive years for
the best musical talent to be hired in the State.
The lady of the house always believed in helping
along local industries and stranded professionals.
She was gorgeously philanthropic in her ways.
In the Cold Country now she rambles about
quietly.
The movable feast days have commenced. All
the mountain cottagers and sea-side sojourners
have packed up and hied away for the great
season of mosquitoes. It is the thing to turn out
of the town kennel, to drop the blinds and put
pinnies on the furniture till the March flies start
their racket. Suzettes are in demand among the
unfortunates who have to eat the Christmas goose
and other Yule-tide indigestibles, but there are
none to be had. Mosquito time is Suzette’s
shining period, when tips at the beach hotel or
the large Todgers establishment are plentiful and
nights off ” are frequent, and there’s always a
willin Barkis ready for a pas cl deux in the moon-
light. Catch Suzette sitting among the back-
numbers in a deserted city when the swagger are
net-casting from fashionable shores.
Ihe Bowes Kelly clan—cousins, aunts, and
household pets—charter the Loongana for the
Bass Straits’ trip this week, arriving in the Weary
Isle in time to roast the fatted goose. Mrs.
Edwin Miller —the grass widow with the burnt
gold hair—remains behind to keep up the family’s
end of the stick.
The Archbishop Clarkes ship for Seddon Land
in the babyhood of 1906 This will leave the
chagrined Grace in complete mastery of the Arch
situation for a month or two. The matter of pre-
cedence and priority doesn’t only affect the
Arches. The faithful have taken it up, and now
S P-oL- W k en " Archbishop” is mentioned.
Which Archbls bop ? ” says the Anglican inarm.
< the Arc hbishop,” says the R.C. dame.
,mu doean ’ fc clear things,” snorts the A.M.
Ihe Archbishop is Dr. Carr, of course,” sniffs
the R.C. dame, and then the battle rages round
the Arches.
A pair of Camperdown trippers—Mr. and Mrs.
Leslie Macarthur—hie back from a long jaunt
this week. The Macedonia bears them to these
shores.
The Athenaeum Club shivoo the other Monday
didn t come off without a violent protest from the
elderly element. The idea of petticoats swishing
about the club quarters angered the grey Conser-
vatives, but the jaunty Bohemian bachelors were
in the majority and won the toss. The shivoo
proved the gayest and fizziest spree of this straw-
berry season. Mr. Dick Rowe, as the heaviest
swell of the club, was on the Collins-street mat
with the forward paw of greeting. A shoal of
femininity swept up the stairs and flowed over the
big comfy apartments, where song and story,
and, the Sibyl, and lots of bubbly-water were
turned on for the willing.
Nothing perkier than the Georgian millinery
flourished by Mrs. Bowes Kelly was to be seen at
the Athenaeum Club spree; and that’s saying much,
for the clothes-competition was tremendous. Some
of Williamson’s little stars, revolved among the
social satellites, notably Miss Rose Musgrove
m a , Trenchy rig and a very pallid complexion.
JLyphoid seems to have taken all the color out of
Rose’s complexion. The girleens of the party and
the middle-aged members flourishing silk socks and
red ties were wroth that the much-married marms
were eight deep round the Oracle, leaving
no room or hope for anyone else. What the
mother of seven can have to expect or learn from
a prophetess passes understanding. Yet even the
cheapest suburban oracle will tell you that her
most reliable client is the broad-bui'lt mother of
many children who still dreams of romance and
has faint visions of eloping with a duke.
The demonstration of high kick and frantic fling
by the pupils of Mrs. W. Green was a bigger
surprise than ever this year. The expert wlurler
came not as a single spy, but in battalions. Every
step possible to the trained trilby and the well-
drilled toe was precociously executed by mites of
three summers and upwards. One dot—Queenie
Williams—a,cted, danced and sang like a highly-
paid professional artist. Her voice filled the Town
Hall, and her grotesque coon waddle knocked the
huge audience over like one single ninepin. Miss
Irene Dillon turned her special high-grade dancing
feet to good account in a seductive impudent
whirl. Dozens of soloists in whirlwind frillies
cavorted high and fast, their legs and their skirts
being lost alternately in the air with an amazing
rapidity. But regarded as a children’s ball the
Green display _ was not so happy as the Hon.
Hyam’s gathering a week earlier.
The limb de resistance at the Town Hall fling
belonged to Miss Florrie Green, the youthful
trainer of the dancing toe. She had a second
limb to match it, and used the pair in an entranc-
ing series of wave-movements, a vaporish scarf
lending the effect of a billowing sea. It was a
sea dance. This by degrees resolved itself into
Siren revolvings of dreamful languor. The whirler
warmed to it, her step grew faster, her movements
more amazing, and she finished with a whirlwind
fling of brilliant diablerie. It was the Siren
waking to life and a fit of tantalising exuberance.
Whole nurseries of exotics were emptied on the
stage in reward for Miss Florrie’s performance.
Miss Queenie Cadden’s voice pleased an expen-
sively dressed audience one night recently, and
her chiffons counted high in the platformer’s
favor. She’s altogether a sweeter, more taking
Miss than she was before her jaunt to the Cold
Country and the subsequent quartet wanderings
in the provinces. A short season of comic opera
has given Miss Cadden an enticing air on the
concert planks.
Miss Florence Young introduces all her re-
cently-cultivated Yank style into “ The Girl
from Kay’s.” All the frocks of the giddy hat-
rigger role are full, short, and severely cut in the
slap-up manner of the New Yorker. The clothing
of Florence, from the time she has Hoggie
threading her needles in the front act to the
triumphant moment when she arrives at the tune
of being Mrs. Hoggenheimer, of Park Lane, is
faultlessly smart and festive. Florence has never
looked sprightlier in any production.
Miss Tilly Woodlock has been re-engaged for
the special comic opera pirouette in the place of
Miss May Hillas, the sprightly nymph of the
tangled thatch and whirling understandings. The
importation of Tilly is a vast concern to the
theatre-goer, on account of her great gamut of
expressions, which match her convolutions to a
nicety. Her features have an eloquently gay
Parisienne way of accompanying the dance, and
one is as well occupied watching these as following
the flashing feet.
Miss Rita Kiddle is flaunting her Asiatic tastes
in the eyes of Collins-street and Toorak once
more. She bursts periodically on the view, has a
meteoric fling, and is gone again. At “The Girl
from Kay’s, ” last Saturday, the squatter’s bright
chick was enveloped in a fiery red silk irides-
cent cloak, so that in the distance she looked like
a brilliant conflagration, with a shining coal-black
head-piece. However, no one bothered to put her
out.
The death of a wealthy old squatter-dame was
conducted recently with all the pomp and cere-
mony of a great domestic event. For the occasion,
the patient’s bed was drawn into the ballroom,
and there her kith and kin collected in solemn
conclave for the final moment. Faint memories
came to one of the feudal fashion that called for
the assemblage of vassals and serfs when some
wrinkled potentate was at his last gasp. The
ballroom as a place for a religious old lady to
die in doesn’t seem quite the usual thing, but it
was her fancy to pass away in state, and the clan
didn’t dispute the matter.
The polo ponies of one of the Lempriere
brothers went under the hammer the other day.
It’s Charlie of that ilk, and his contemplation of
the matrimonial stakes with Miss Dora Mitchell
may have something to do with the sale. The
trio of baby nags were named Dolly, Dottie, and
Diana.
When H.M.S. Challenger called at Portland
(Vic.) recently an aldermanic party rowed out to
the vessel to take a cup of tea with the captain
and tell him all about Portland’s magnificent
natural resources. Just as the mayor stepped
from the boat on his return the 21 guns of a royal
salute started to boom forth. The mayor’s chest
swelled visibly, while the smiles of the town clerk
and the aldermen were like so many open boot
trunks, and the local editor rushed off to get out
an edition that would rise to the: occasion. But,
alas ! in the next issue this happened :
Correction.—ln alluding to the salute given by H.M.S.
Challenger on Friday at noon, we were in error in in-
ferring such was to mark the landing of the Mayor and
party on the wharf, after an official visit to the ship. It
was, however, rather a strange coincidence that the salute
should take place just on the landing of the Mayoral
party. The salute, however, was a royal one of 21 guns,
given to mark the anniversary of the'birthday of Queen
Alexandra.
Just died in Adelaide, John Sumner, a well-
known half-caste, and a valuable exhibit on the
platform for Home Missions. Two years ago he
got an Aborigines’ Friends’ Association meeting
all tangled up with his eloquent candor. “ I have
a wife, and everyone on the mission station will
tell you I have never said a word to her.
(Laughter.) I have twins there. (Loud
laughter.) I tell all you young men that I hope
you will follow my example.” (Uncontrollable
laughter.) Curious how the Truly Good always
laugh at twins.
A friend, writing from Kalgoorlie : “Gardening
here is an expensive hobby, even if one runs but a
little flower patch. A flower show is held twice a
year, and there is a prize for the best garden.
Hocking, proprietor of the Miner, or a merchant
named Brennan takes the prize every time. It
oosts each of them quite £2OO a year for garden
water.”
, Yankee Artist Dana Gibson announces his
intention of giving up black and white work, so
the “Gibson Girl ” will, according to the cards,
get a well-earned rest.
The skittish now allude to Rep. Kelly’s motor
as “Master Willie’s pram.” This is the cruellest
cut of all. “ Elijah’s chariot ” used to please the
Harbor Rep. The new label hurts.
Yours Affectionately, Tryphena.
Page, M.H.R., raised the question, t’other
day, as to why the Sergeant-at-Arms, when he
ushers Mr. Speaker into the House, carries the
blessed Mace on his shoulder and comports him-
self with special dignity, whereas he merely uses
the bauble as a walking stick when Mr. Deputy-
Speaker is about to take the Chair. The Deputy
explained that by the sacred laws of tradition the
Mace-bearer was bound to draw this distinction
between the “star” official and his understudy.
As regards their authority for ruling purposes one
man is as good as the other, but in relation to the
Sergeant and the Mace they have different degrees
of importance. And we call it a Commonwealth
Government ! The only Commonwealth that
Britain ever knew was controlled by a nubbly-
faced farmer who ordered the Mace off the pre-
mises as if it had been a stray dog.
The Paraffine Paint Co., the people who
are covering the roofs of Australia with P. & B.
materials, and supplying paints and dampcourses
to keep out the wet when there is any, has struck
a new and interesting idea of letting its agents
throughout Australasia know what one another
are doing. This new idea is a booklet, “ Our
Interchange,” which furnishes particulars of the-
vast number of things that the various agents
have found P. & B. materials to be good for ; and
they are certified to be good for anything from a
cathedral to a fowl-house.
John L. Sullivan had been appearing: fora year or two
as hero of a pugilistic drama when America's foremost
actor, Edwin Booth, died. On hearing of Booth’s death
John L. sadly remarked, “It's a great loss. There are'
dam few of us left ! ”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Told to the Tariff Commission that kan-
garoo skin makes the finest leather in the world.
The Yankees know it, get our Too skins, tan them,
and make them into boots which come back here as
samples of “the sort of work Australians can’t
turnout.” The Australian share in the process
is the “ great national industry ” of allowing the
little Too to grow in mama’s marsupium.
Under the wonderful Federal tariff stained
glass windows for churches and public institu-
tions come in free, while if a local man imports
the glass to make the beautiful church window he
pays 15 per cent, on it. Consequently, in this
respect, the foreign maker of the window with the
picture of Jpnah swallowing Goliath on it gets 15
per cent. Protection against the Australian under
the amazing fool of an Australian tariff.
Considering the flagrant violation of his
promises on the subject of loan moneys, a statu-
tory declaration should be insisted on from
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers as to the ultimate
destination of the £lO,OOO cash for which he sold
the yacht Victoria to an English firm. This toy
boat cost about £36,000 out of loan votes, so that
a permanent interest charge of £lOOO a year was
added to the public debt as a result of the transac-
tion. Parliament should see that slippery Joseph
does not pay this £lO,OOO towards his next sur-
plus, but make certain that it is applied to extin-
guishing a part of the old loan. The other part
of the old loan should be extinguished out of
revenue seeing that the asset is gone.
N.S. W. is preparing to again go into the
assisted immigration business. The idea is a good
one if the land for the immigrants to go on, or the
factories for them to go into, were all ready, but
in the present ineffective state of the tariff and
the present muddled condition of the improve-
ment lease any large immigration policy is a put-
ting of the cart before the horse —a process which
deteriorates the vehicle and aggravates the animal.
Something definite seems to have emerged
from the Russian chaos ; a Lettish Republic has
arisen in the Baltic provinces. Probably it will
be short-lived, but, even so, it may be the precursor
of a real Russian Republic. There are about 30
Grand Dukes who urgently require hanging before
the republic has a fair chance, but trees are plenti-
ful, and time is plentiful, and-with trees and time
an immense amount can be done in the rehabilita-
tion of the Muscovite State.
The clause in the Commonwealth Electoral
Bill making it an offence punishable by fine for an
employee to absent himself from his employment
under the pretence of voting, but without a bona
fide intention of voting, strikes a big army of
dodgers. At State elections these individuals
have obtained leave to quit work (by the Com-
monwealth law, employers will be obliged under a
penalty to grant leave) and have promptly acquired
a hook and a prawm and gone fishing.
The N.S.W. State Ministry has crawled
into recess. Its North Coast Railway Bill is dead
somewhere. Its Municipalities Bill got lost, and
for the second time Carruthers funked on his
Banking Bill. But he whacks violently at the
stuffed lion of Federal grievances, and says that
on tliis matter he lias “ only begun to fight.” On
his proposal to pay half the price of the North
Coast railway out of revenue, Joe apparently
hasn’t even begun to think of fighting.
The loss of the Manufacture's Encourage-
ment Bill, which was thrown out in the Senate by
a majority of one, wasn’t such a great loss after
all. The original idea was to start the Australian
iron industry by a system of bonuses, and shove it
along till it was fairly equal to local demands;
then to stop the bonuses and suppress imports
with a sufficient duty, and let things take their
course. The Bill which didn’t pass proposed to
put a very insufficient duty on imported iron as
soon as there was a respectable local supply, but
as it proposed nothing in the way of bonuses to
create that local supply in the first place it wasn’t
likely to lead to very much. It is true that the
N.S.W. State Government is doing something by
bonuses to start a N.S.W. iron industry, but
unless there is a Federal boqus in addition the
supply that will meet the whole Australian
demand seems al'jgwayoff. Next session the
Bill should come up as a Federal Iron Bonus Bill,
with a duty to follow —a large bonus to begin
with and a 50 per cent, duty to follow.
THE MAN IN CHARGE.
To-day Japan had charge of Australia, if they read the
treaty with Britain aright, and the slur cast on the in-
habitants of the East would have to be removed.
Melville, M.L.C. (Vic.), on Chinese Employment.
Pulsford moved the adjournment of the
Senate to elicit expressions of opinion regarding
the Carruthers-capital outburst. And these are
some of the expressions he elicited :
“Mr. Carruthers’ picture has been over-colored.”—
Pulsford himself.
“Little short of impudent.”—Matiieson.
“ Perky little Premier.”—Mulcahy.
“ A pig stuck under a gate.”—Givens.
“ A bandit and a highway robber.”—Stewart.
When the Senate starts out to express an opinion
it does it vigorously.
It is now announced that £1,978,000 worth
of neutral shipping was destroyed during the
Bear-Monkey war, the Bear having destroyed
£620,000 worth, while the Ape did the other
£1,358,000 worth of damage. The cable-howls
didn’t sound like that at the time ; while the war
was on one might have thought that the Bear was
sinking everything in sight, while the sea-Monkey
only stopped neutral ships' in order to put pro-
visions and liquor on board them and ask the
captains to dinner. But the cable is a hysterical
sort of sea-serpent, and supplies remarkable infor-
mation.
“ lied Tape Junior ” writes :
Early next year is to see the quinquennial grading of
N.S.W. Public Service by the P.S. Board when, according
to the P.S. Act, each public servant who can show his
right to increased pay has a chance to get it, and as in-
crements of late years have been as rare as blue giraffes,
the public servants, intend to make the most of the
chance. And said chance is equal to Buckley’s. For
Carruthers placed on his Estimates the sum of £l6OO to
meet these increases—equal to about 2s. lOd. per head all
round. If one man grabs enough to make a decent rise
of salary, arithmetic will unanimously agree that a horde
of other public officers must go without. There is, of
course, the chance of getting Carruthers to exceed the
amount voted, but that chance seems Buckley’s also.
Premier Bent with a Parliamentary party
visited Queenscliff (Vic.) forts, the other day, and
at the inevitable food-and-drink, State Command-
ant Colonel Ricardo is reported to have said :
He was pleased that the Premier had accepted the sug-
gestion to visit the forts. Personally he always felt that
as Commandant he was a State officer first, and a Com-
monwealth officer next. It was very well to talk of the
Commonwealth military forces, but the State paid for its
own defences.
Minister Playford has promised an inquiry ; and
if the inquiry shows that Mr. Ricardo really used
the words attributed to him, then Mr. Ricardo
should be taught that, whatever Mr. Ricardo
“feels personally, ’’ the Commonwealth, and not
Victoria, is Mr. Ricardo’s master. And the
lesson should be such that, for a long time to
come, no Commonwealth servant will dare to kow-
tow to petty State politicians by publicly sneering
at his employer.
N.S.W. Political Labor League has de-
cided to appoint an organiser to tour the State in
the interests of the party. But the party wants
a definite purpose more than an organiser just
now.
William M‘Millan hangs out a lot of fine
fluffy stuff re Federal capital controversy :
In dealing between States, sovereign or semi-sovereign,
the broad equities of the situation must be kept entirely
in the foreground of the discussion—mutual susceptibili-
ties must be carefully studied, the spirit, not the letter
of the law, must be kept constantly in view.
But no sooner have customers approved of these
trimmings than he demands that N.S.W. shall be
granted “ paramountcy ” in choosing the capital
site.
Canadian Commissioner Larke, returning
from Canada, tells of the whyness of its pros-
perity :
Every city visited by Mr. Larke he found marvellously
improved. He scarcely found one factory that could not
have employed more labor had it been obtainable. Many
other factories had lately been completely rebuilt, and
nearly every one has been fitted with modern machinery.
And with the same sort of tariff as Canada
Australia could do that, and better; for our
timber, coal, iron and copper resources are
superior.
The people of the little back-blocky town of
Parkes (N.S.W.) have held a meeting and decided
that the conduct of the Australian in
not at once fixing the capital at Lyndhurst, so as
to be right alongside Parkes, is a breach of good
faith and shows an anti-Federal spirit. And
seeing that the Commonwealth only exists, in the
opinion of Parkes, so that the Federal capital
may be near Parkes, this feeling on the part of
Parkes is quite understandable. Parkes is close
to Tomingley, Trundle, Manildra, Bindogundia
and Bunbury, and isn’t a place to be scoffed at
with impunity.
Even Sydney Telegraph falls in gratitude
on the neck of the High Court for upsetting the
foolish decision of N.S.W. Supreme Court, which
exempted the half-circus Agricultural Soc'ety of
N.S.W. from paying its rates to the City Council,
on the ground that it was a public institution. It
would serve the circus and pumpkin people right
if the public money wasted through its endeavor
to burke the council of its dues was deducted from
the Society’s subsidy. This decision is supposed
to have brought to a head the whole question of
exempting charitable and other public institutions
from payment of municipal rates. The way to
settle it is plainly to abolish all exemptions, and
if any institution is considered worthy of public aid
to vote that aid openly out of the revenue.
‘ ‘ Two Seas ” : Having had a woeful ex-
perience of the difficulty in making the N.S.W.
Lands Depart-
ment hustle
without first
greasing a
land agent, I
don’t claim
that the fol-
lowing ex-
ample is a
record. On
May 9th, 1872,
a selector paid
up the balance
due on his con-
ditional pur-
chase, and
then sat down
to await the
issue of a
Crown grant
for the same.
The poor fel-
low waited
patiently for
five years and
then died, ex-
horting hi s
wife to bear
up and pbtain
that Crown
grant before
she followed him. The wife died, and the
Department was still politely informing her
in a beautiful round hand on an unnecessary
expanse of costly paper that “the grant would
issue in due course,” and that it “had the
honor to remain,” etc. So the years tolled on
until last August, when a descendant of the
selector who paid up in 1872 thought it was time
to make application for that grant through an
agent. Then the Department fell over itself in
ics haste, and a Crown grant was issued a fortnight
after the agent got on the job.
“ Maroona ” : I want right here to
endorse all the remarks of “A Victorian Corres-
pondent” re the extended “lengths” of 10 miles
to be kept in repair by four men on Victorian
railways (B. 26/10/’O5). On the 10 miles there are
40 miles of “chipping” to be done —10 miles
along railway fence on each side for firebreak,
and 10 miles each side of the rails, sft. out,
beside keeping weeds down inside and outside the
rails. And if four men do this they won’t have
time to keep the line itself in repair.. Already
one can notice bad “nips ” in the line, and many
places that want “pulling” badly. Yes, that big
smash is coming all right.
The latest N.S.W. State woe is that the
local Attorney-General has “ strongly protested ”
to Prime Minister Deakin about the proposal to
restrict the sittings of the High Court to Mel-
bourne. It might be mentioned that it was
George Reid of N.S.W., who, when Federal
Prime Minister, brought forward this proposal,
or allowed his Attorney-General to do it, and
that was a long time ago. Presumably the
present protest to Deakin is intended to create
the idea that the scheme is a live one, fathered
by the “enemies of N.S.W. now in power,” and
consequently another “grievance.”
' Bottles are being imported into Australia
from Japan in tons. The ruling Jap wage for
bottle makers is lOd. per day, against 10s. per day
in Australia. The local manufacture has slumped
heavily since Federation imposed the present in-
adequate duties, and for several months in each
year most of the bottle works in the Common-
wealth have to close down for want of work.
Japanese-made bottles are also swamping Britain,
where they are free of duty. The U. S. bottle-
duty is 60 per cent.
A return has been issued showing the
amount which the Senators cost their country in
stamps and telegrams during the past 12 months.
Keating (Tasmania) cost £l7 4s. 4d. ; Walker
(N.S.W.), £l5 13s. 3d. ; Dobson (Tasmania),
£l3 ss. lOd. ; and Pearce (W.A.), £l2 11s. Bd.
At the other end of the list six senators, including
Minister Playford (S.A.), managed to keep under
£l, and Trenwith (Victoria) struggled through on
Bd. When a man gets so near to it as that he might
as well make an effort, and cost nothing at all.
For the sake of helping a fellow-creature'to put
up a record this paper would pay the Bd.
Japan, which complains so bitterly of Aus-
tralian legislation, won’t allow an Australian any
patent rights in Japland. An Australian inventor
wanting protection for his patent in Japan must
get it through a dummy.
“ Are white men so frightened of the Mon-
golian that they come crawling to the Government
for this kind of legislation?” yapped Harwood,
M.L.C., in the Victorian Upper House re the
Chinese Employment Bill. If Victorian electors
had a decent sense of pride they would answer
Harwood next time he comes crawling for votes.
He can understand his friends the squatters
being so frightened of the rabbit and the thistle
that they crawl to the Government to have their
industries protected from the plagues, but when
the worker wants his billet protected from a worse
plague the scorn of Harwood is like the scoff of
seven devils.
The “ great Freetrade Party ” in N.S.W.
is rapidly giving up the ghost. One of its erstwhile
leaders, David Storey, M.L.A., spoke thus during
the N.S.W. Financial Statement debate (Han-
sard, No. 29, page 3555): —
If we have a shrinkage in revenue, there can be no
doubt that we have a greater number of men employed
in manufacturing. That is the natural consequence of
the Federal tariff. I know that the shrinkage must grow
every year, as the operation of the Federal tariff becomes
more effective. Any Freetrader will admit that a heavy
tariff will stop imports and therefore decrease the Customs
revenue ; so that it really means that we have more
people employed and more Australian goods sold than we
had prior to Federation.
The Jay Pee received the cruellest blow
that has yet fallen on his unappreciated cranium
in the House of Representatives the other night.
The Electoral Bill provided that applications for
postal votes might be witnessed by schoolmasters,
postmasters, policemen, quarantine station-keepers,
even lighthouse-keepers—and" by justices of the
peace. Whereupon Jim Page, M.H.R., arose to
declare that the Jay Pee was politically rotten,
and should not be allowed to witness anything.
Storrer, a weary Tasmanian, arose and said that
he was a Jay Pee, and was insulted by such gross
allegations. Nevertheless, the Reps, expunged
the Jay Pees with joyful contumely. So it appears
that the Bumbles who administer the law cannot
be trusted to witness a private document, lest they
should go away and sell the information for a
beer to the first man they meet.
The wildest secessionist cockadoodle up to
date was probably a letter (headed “A Spade”
and signed “ Van ”) in Sydney ’Graph :
New South Wales is now the Commonwealth of
Australia, and has the right to summon the States’
representatives to meet at Runnymede, 100 miles from
Sydney, beneath the spreading eucalypt, with a saddle-
flap for the President’s de-lt, and there repeal all Acts
showing partiality for olass or State.
The allusion to “ the President ” evidently means
that Edward VII. and his Governor and Gov.-
General are played out, and the blanky shirt of
rebellion is going to wave. Heaven only knows
what “Van” has been drinking, but it seems a
remarkably good brand, and if he will send in the
name this paper will buy a keg ot it.
A military officer writing to express thanks
for Bulletin advocacy of a self-respecting defence
system :
Even with that it would be necessary to bring the thing
down to a business proposition instead of attempting a
feeble —an almost laughable—imitation of the Imperial
army—an attempt which is utterly useless where condi-
tions are so dissimilar. I certaiidy don’t think it would
be an exaggeration to say that 10 per cent, of defence
expenditure is incurred in making up returns of useless
information, prepared simply and solely because similar
returns are prepared in the Imperial army. Yet in
Australia there is hardly time for work which should be
done, while in the Imperial army work must be made, or
the men would go crazy with the monotony of idleness.
And that is the essential difference.
F. A. McKenzie gives London Daily Mail
some facts about the Protectionist and anti-alien
policy of Japan :
About 1896 fresh legislation was passed that drove the
majority of English officers and engineers out of the
shipping service.. . A scale of bounties for home ship-
building was fixed, 245. a ton for steamers of from 700
to 1000 tons, and £2 a ton for those over a thousand tons
in size. There is a further allowance of 10s. for each one-
horse power on the engine. Only thirty-six steamers had
been built in Japan in 1896. In 1901 the number built
was seventy-one. At.the same time the total of steamers
purchased abroad, mainly in England, dropped instantly.
Once Japan bought sailing ships abroad ; now she builds
practically all her own, and is beginning to sell vessels
to outside nations.
The subsidies for the establishment of shipping lines
were on a still more liberal scale. Japan has now spent
about a million and a half a year, for some years in suc-
cession, on direct subsidies to traders. The main part of
this has gone to one semi-Government line—the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha. The companies connected with shipping
which are thus subsidised by the Government pay an
average of 12 per cent, in dividends. No part of their
shares can be held by foreigners. In nine years ending
1902 the Japanese Government paid over ten million
pounds in industrial subsidies. Wealth for wealth, it
is as though England had paid a hundred millions to help
on her commerce in the same time.
During the discussion on the Contract
Immigrants Bill in the Senate, the other} night,
Senator Fraser said :
He knew a case in which Mr. Carruthers Premier of
N.S.W., had had land near Wagga ready for immigrants,
and had wished to bring them here, but had been
stopped. Mr. Carruthers had said so in a letter to them
(the Freetraders).
Labor Senators challenged Fraser to produce that
letter, but, as might have been expected, Fraser
produced nothing of the kind. Yet the matter
wants clearing up. When did Carruthers have this
alleged land ready? Who stopped himfrom bringing
out his alleged immigrants? Under what law or
authority did anyone stop him ? Why didn’t Car-
ruthers explain the affair publicly instead of (as
Fraset alleges) writing about it to his Tory pals
in the Senate? Why didn’t Fraser publish
Carruthers’ alleged letter immediately on its re-
ception, so that the public might know that some-
one was keeping immigrants out of the country ?
And why didn’t Fraser produce and read the
alleged letter in the Senate, particularly when
challenged to do so? And how did Carruthers
manage to have this blessed land and immigration
policy all ready without N.S.W. Assembly know-
ing anything about it ? In short, is it just the
usual Tory slander and invention ?
SECESH.

When your party cries have failed you and your followers
grow lax,
And the fellows who’ve assailed you are renewing their
attacks,
Don’t waste your time in hunting round the world for
something fresh ;
Hoist the good old hunk of bunting—raise the standard
of Secesh,
Secesh !
Raise it high and see if that’ll cause the local drum to
rattle.; pass the word for blood and battle and the
standard of Secesh !
Ho, stand and watch Oarruthers while he foameth at the
jore,
Crying, “Come, my trodden brothers ; let us bend the
knee no more ;
Let us twist the gory tyrant in a legislative mesh ;
Fellow-citizens aspirant! join with me and howl Secesh—
Secesh !
Green dog and pup of yellow; cease to chew the other
fellow ! just shut your eyes and bellow for Oarruthers
and Secesh 1 "
Did we federate? We rue it—as the Sydney papers tell,
But Oarruthers will undo it: holy Moses, hear him yell 1
You may judge how earnest is he by the quiver of his flesh,
By his language loud and dizzy, by the way he squeals
Secesh—

By his steamings and his vapors, by his wild and giddy
capers while he raves at all the papers that refuse him

A feature of peculiar politics in Banana-
land just now is the warm friendship between
Janny Leahy and Joe Lesina.
The Philp crowd in Queensland is supply-
ing country rags with free “leaders” abusing
Federation'. Joey hasn’t got as far as that yet in
N.S.W. in working up public opinion.

“H.S.R.”: If the. Affable One intends
buying some of Britannia’s old iron in the shape
of ships, why not try and get the Encounter or

three or four years on the stocks, and are obsolete
before being launched ?
The Balfour Government will possibly go
down to history as the “Asiatic Cabinet.” It
waged war in S’Africa to supplant British and
Boer workmen with Chinese slaves, and dropped
the British tradition of “splendid isolation” to
make an alliance with an Asiatic power.
About the most humorous thing on record
is the cool effrontery with which the Carruthers
people chirp that under their guidance N.S.W. is
balanced on the apex of prosperity, while they
are prepared to prove that, through Federal mis-
government, the Ma State is wallowing in the
slough of despond.
Thus Senator Stewart :
They had heard that Australia was in bad odor in Great
Britain. Where was Great Britain ? It was that wretched
quarter of London known as the Stock Exchange, where
the sharks of the money-market fleeced the entire world.
He admitted that Australia stank in the nostrils of the
Stock Exchange, but that was because they could not
make enough money out of it.

Oldsmobile Standard 7 h.p. Runabout.
The Oldsmobile is America’s most successful motor car.
It is so strongly and perfectly built, so durable and reliable, that it
has successfully accomplished a 3000 mile endurance run in England, a
30 days’ continuous trial trip on the continent and a 3500 mile race across
the United States of America.
It is especially adapted for use in this country because of its con-
struction, economy of operation, mechanical simplicity (repairs cost
practically nothing with intelligent handling) and its ample power.
The Oldsmobile Standard Runabout is really worth twice what it
costs—and is sold at a remarkably low price, because we know how to
produce the highest automobile efficiency at a minimum cost.
Investigate the merits and save money by owning an Oldsmobile.

Lack of Energy.
That Feeling op “Not too Well.”
In almost every instance that Lack of Energy
is due to a weak system. Weak, because the
liver or kidneys, or bowels are in a sluggish con-
u ol |’ /, ncl , the wll ole energy of the body is
absorbed by these organs. Have you ever noticed
how much better you can work, or walk or pkiy
when you feel quite well ? Yes ; and use twice as
much energy and yet feel less tired. Yet thou-
sands of men and women feel weak and tired, and
wear that weary look. It positively becomes a
disease in many cases, and its ultimate results are
not to be conjectured. Stimulants and tonics give
temporary relief only. You must get the remedy
tnat will put new life into your body, fresh energy
into your muscles, brace up your nerves, brighten
your countenance, and give a silver lining to every
cloud. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills tone up the
liver and kidneys, and by aiding in the digestion
and assimilation of food they replenish the system
with warm and healthy blond, giving vigor to the
whole body, and a happy issue out of all your
afflictions. I)r. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a
perfect blood purifier, and a positive and perman-

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Melbournes most classic cycling meeting, the
Austral, ended on Saturday night in glorious weather
after a day of stormy incidents. The racing was held
during both afternoon and evening, and in the daylight
the attendance was just wretched. At night, when the
Austral final was to be on deck, the people came and
barracked enthusiastically. The afternoon saw the
M.B.C. Plate, a mile affair with £4O first prize, fall to O.
H. Brook, of N.S. VV. The Exhibition Mile produced a
whole crop of troubles in the final heat, where Rutt got
hemmed in and finally forced off the track on to the grass.
Then the stewards came down heavily, and, after an
investigation, fined Pye and Clarke £5 each for collusion
and dealt with George Earley to the same amount for un-
fair riding and blocking Rutt. Farley was immensely
disgusted, and at once withdrew from the meeting-
throwing up his start in the Austral semi-final; which
was as regrettable as it was foolish. In the evening
the three semi-final and final heats of the Austral
were run off amid great excitement. In the final J. H.
Sandberg, on the 140yds. mark, was at the tail of the pro-
cession, with Joe Megson (40yds.) in front. The man who
led the show was far away, 140yds. ahead, on the 280yds.
mark. The front markers did not whizz as they might
have done, and the result was that after a lap the field
bunched. Then Levey and Sandberg dashed away, with
Megson in full flight close behind. Levey went to the
front, and 20yds. from home swerved violently in front of
Sandberg, who, to avoid a collision, ran up the bank, sat
up, and raised his hand in protest. Levey dashed over
the line ; Sandberg rode over it slowly, with Megson just
a wheel behind. The stewards upheld the protest, and
awarded the £5OO to Sandberg, the £lOO to Megson, and
the £2O to Eryon, the limit man. Levey is talking of
appealing, and other things.
Sandberg, who was declared winner of the
Austral Wheel Race, is a 6ft. Victorian, who, two years
ago, got flattened out by a falling tree while touring in
Tasmania. However, they pulled him straight, and the
inside works readjusted themselves in the course of over
a year’s careful nursing. Now he comes back to the track
m real earnest, and starts to make up lost time by
winning three races at this one meeting, and running
second twice. This is tiie second time that the race has
been run on an asphalt track. The time, 4min. 24 2-ssec.,
is 8 2-ssec. slower than last year's, when A. J. Clark won
from the 150yd*. mark. One feature of the race was that
not a foreign crack competed in the final.
* * *
Walter Butt, Henri Mayer, and George Farley,
the Australian, put up a wonderful pacing exhibition in
their heat of the Austral. Mayer was not ready at gun
fire, and made a shocking start only when the field was
well on its way. Rutt went off at a tremendous bat,
under the impression that he was pacing Mayer up to the
front markers, but when he pulled off for Mayer to take
his turn at the end of the lap, he found that Mayer was,
like the' beer in the Scriptures, afar off. There was
nothing for it but to wait, or go on and bust, and Rutt
waited. Then Mayer came up, full of wrath and sauer-
kraut, and the two Germans wiped the sweat out of their
eyes, and with Teutonic grunts rushed on after the field
that tore away in front. After desperate alternate efforts
they overtook Farley, and when the three took turns at
pacing the field was caught in the rush for home. Then
the front markers went like the wind, and the exhausted
Teutons fell back ; but big Farley bent down and lifted
his machine clean out of the ruck, and finished first by a
rim. It was a great race, and by far the most interesting
of all the tussles for the big £5OO prize.

“ F.C.” sends a bit of description :—“ The great
Austral Wheel Race, which, a few years back, was a
sassiety function boasting 30,000 spectators, this year
reached the level of a suburban pony meeting—and
transpired in an even worse odor. The preliminary heats,
interspersed with sundry scratch and handicap events,
had been spread over four afternoons and as many even-
ings, but none save enthusiasts took much notice thereof,
while barely 8000 attended on Saturday night to see the
final run. Ikey Noses were there by the score, bellowing
as at Flemington or Richmond ; while one could hardly
move along the bank for the pestiferous attentions of
sweep-promoters. Yankee pie-biters Lawson and MacFar-
land had got the pip, or the hump, or something, and
had gone off to what they said were the superior
attractions of Westralia, but as there was no
£650 Austral to be run for over there, that
excuse got the credit it deserved, and no more.
Most of the favorites—J. Arnst, A. J. Clark, P. O’Brien,
H. O. Brook—dropped out in the semi-final, and the final
was reckoned to lie between Sandberg, the actual scratch
man, at 140yds., and Rivers, the limit man, at 270yds.
Ikey yelled 2 to 1 Rivers, 3 to 1 Sandberg, 6 to 1 Megson,
10 to 1 others. Sandberg caught his field in the second
lap, and thenceforward the bunch of a dozen crawled
gradually round till the bell announced the final sprint.
With the back-markers right up it looked their race till
the last five yards, when S. S. Levey, of Vic., shot out of
the front row and beat Sandberg by a yard, with Megson
third, and Freyon fourth. Time 4.24 2-5. Painfully
slow. Sandberg won on a protest, which was also pain-
fully slow.”

Melbourne Bicycle Club adorned the entrance
to the Exhibition, where the Austral meeting was being
held, with glaring notices reading thus :
No person will be permitted to wager or bet, or
offer to make or pay or promise to pay any wager or
bet at the bicycle races. . ..
Signed for and on behalf of the Melb. Bicycle Club
as promoters,
R. McCullagh, Secretary.
Inside, Israel with its bag, its badge, its raucous voice and
its infinitesimal odds, created the same joyful clamor as of
yore. The notice was to comply with the Betting at
Sports Act, and the posting of it gave the M.B.C. power
to shy Israel out of the gate even after he had paid for his
ticket. Israel was allowed to bet because the public has
not yet learned that it can’t pick winners when the win-
ners don’t want it to. There is, therefore, a big demand
for the presence of Israel, and the M.8.C., sensibly
enough, meets the demand. But there’s no need to paste
up a notice on the outer gate which pretends that there’s
no betting inside when you can hear the yells of Israel
even before you arrive at the notice.

George Farley was to have gone to Westralia
for the January racing, but has changed his mind, and
will appear in Sydney to battle for the Emu against the
German Eagle, when the plums of the Summer Wheel
Race are on the table. Judging by recent running
Farley will be the best Australian rival of the foreign
sprinters.

The motor-racing track at Aspendale (Vic.),
which was to have been the scene of a big motor
meeting during Melbourne Cup week, is now considered
to have hardened sufficiently, and the big event
will take place on Boxing Day. Some tall doings are
expected, and all the crack speed, cars of Victoria have
entered for the various events. Hobbs’ Flying Mercedes,
which made such a splash in the Dunlop Reliability Test,
is to be attacked by a whizzing motor bike, which its
owner believes can knock the crack German car right out
in the matter of speed.

Although France won the last Vanderbilt Motor
Cup race, the highest speed was made by one of the
Italian representatives, who got over 198 miles at the rate
of 70 miles an hour, when he came to grief and wasouted.
The terrific speed was probably the cause of the smash.
Hitherto all the world’s records have been made on sandy
beaches, just after the tide went out, and while the sand
was still wet. The flying cars do not have time to sink
into the sand.

The gloom that is hanging over Maoriland at
time of writing is not, as might be supposed by its
density, due to volcanic disturbances, but to the fact that
the world’s record tour has had its symmetry spoilt by a
crowd of prancing Taffies. Wales beat Maoriland by a
solitary try, but the Seddon Islands are still shivering at
the narrow escape from something like a debacle. The
Welsh goal seems to have been in danger only twice,
white the Maorilanders were fighting- all they knew on
their line again and again, and only saved the position

the end of the game the Maorilanders seem to have

by forward passing. This was probably due

Properly managed, the Motor Boat Club has got an

it is necessary that the events should be got off to time

Being the first affair of its kind in Australia,
|i b -L regatta was exceedingly interesting from a historical
point of view. Motors are only in their infancy, and it was
w ith prophetic eye—made more prophetic by lunch—that
this scribe gazed round on the half-dozen speed boats
I'h! Ch for nothing else but shooting
through the water at somewhere about 16 mites an hour
and wondered what his last motor-boat regatta—which
vM™£ on -Fa U ! :,ak< i ldm to wit h great care about 35

the regatta did not compare with the inaugural gathering
and procession to Chowder Bay a few weeks back. The
number of boats was smaller, and only the cruiser that
acted as starter s boat was decorated, and it hung out a
long string of colored flags between the grev water and
the greyer sky on which the storm clouds were laid in
qnl*pnr| h 1 ng * J f he speed launches present were Gorrick’s
splendid new Standard 111., a cedar craft fitted with
20.h.p. engines, which glides noiselessly through the water

raises no backwash. Hissing in and out among the flo-

with -5-h.p. engines, but it looks a crowded, uncomfort-
able craft, built for the maximum of speed with the
minimum of comfort. More graceful, though slower
were the cedar launches Bullet and Little De Dion’
charming little 6-b.p. craft with just room for the girl to
sit beside the navigator, and hold an umbrella over him
and knock the ash off his cigar while lie steers. Aii that
the De Dion and Bullet want to make them perfect is an
awning, and a disappearing table with a supply of mixed
drinks, which can be raised in front of the'captain by
pressing the foot on the button. Ranged up in rows were
the pleasure launches, many of them models of comfort
and even the gray sky and gray water looked bright
around them with the glow of soft-tinted hats.

When ex-world champion runner Duffey got
back to the States after his trip round the world the Inter-
collegiate Assoc ation began to sniff loudly. It said it
had suspicions and would riot issue a card till it had held
an investigation. Duffey did not apply for the card and
instead announced his retirement and the fact that he
had secured an appointment as sporting editor, and would
shake up the athletic world. He commenced to shake it
u p by a large and generous exposure of his own “past,”
stating that he had “lived on the game ” since 1898.
Then something that he had not anticipated hit him on
his vanity. All his best records, including the evergreen
and amazing 9 3-ssec. for the 100yds., were made after that
date and the secretary of the Amateur Athletic Union of
the U.S.A. at once expunged his name and records from
the book, and declared the men who ran next to him to
have been winners. It was the biggest act of disquali-
fication in athletic history, and setting back the clock of
time is nothing to it. Duffey is now declared to
have never been champion of the world, and his having-
run the 100yds. in 9 3-ssec. has been unrun, and ceased to
have even been done, so to speak. It is proposed to
prosecute him for having competed for tea-pots and other
baubles under false pretences ; also, it is possible that a
whole series of legal actions may be commenced against
him to recover much electro-plated ware ; and altogether
the angry amateur governing bodies are taking the busi-
ness in a very nasty spirit. It seems that in England
Duffey could be prosecuted for what he says he did and
that a fund exists out of which the cost of such prosecu-
twns is defrayed. But Duffey is not in England, and it is
doubtful if there is any law in the great brummy republic
to pursue him. In the meantime Duffey is decidedly
unpopular. The professionals don’t like him—they sav
he has “ narked ” the game ; and the amateurs hold their
noses and turn up the ends of their pants when they
pass him on the sidewalk. Duffey’s magazine is selling
splendidly, but whether he will be able to write interest-
ing matter after he has finished writing about what a bad
lot he is himself remains to be seen.
The moral of the whole pow-wow is that it is
absurd in an age of business, as revealed by land and
butter commissions, to expect a man to incur the hard
toil and self-denial of training for the pleasure of seeing
his name at the head of a list in a record book. If people
are willing to pay money to see a certain man run, jump
or ride a bicycle, or anything else, that fortunate man if
he has any business acumen ” whatever, contrives some-
how to get a share of that money. This fact has been
tacitly recognised by giving for prizes pianos, household
furniture, or open orders on tradesmen. The amateur
business is largely a lie and a smug make-believe, and
founded on some ancient fetish that to race for money is
ungentlemanly, white it is quite proper to race for the
things money will buy. It isn’t the cash prize that the
amateurs need to worry about, it’s the presence of Ikev
Moses. He is the dry rot, and also the centre of the
smell.

is the Axeman’s Cup of £l4O.
The N.S.W.-S.A. cricket match at Adelaide
was a most unpleasant surprise for the home team. In
spite of a couple of ducks the S.A. side pasted 359 on the
board, and handed over the wicket to the Cornstalks with
the satisfied feeling that it had left something solid for
the visitors to climb over. But by evening S.A. began to
realise that it was in a bad plight, the Cornstalks having
made 357 (only two behind) for the loss of two wickets,
and one of the not out men who had piled up 164
showed no signs of breaking down. On Monday the
century-maker, Diamond, retired from the match on
account of his brother’s death ; but his departure did not
stop the scoring, though it certainly reduced it. The
innings ended with 556, leaving S.A. 197 to make to avoid
a defeat on the first innings alone. Apparently the
prospect took the grit out of the Crow-eaters, and
they began to crumple up at the very start. The
first two wickets fell for only one run, the mighty
Clem Hill, who had made 146 in the first innings,
being responsible for the bird. This disaster broke the
team right up ; despair gat hold of them, as father Bunyan
would say, and the side disappeared for 115. Cotter’s
bowling seems to have had something to do with • the
result, for that human 'balista sent down 10 overs, of
which two were maidens, and had only 27 runs scored off
him, although he only took one wicket. Garnsey bowled
15 overs, of which three were maidens, and although he
had a whole 48 runs scored off him, he was responsible for
the fall of six wickets. It was a regular Liao-Yang in
cricket.
* * • *
While Noble’s team was pounding S.A. to pieces
at Adelaide, a second Cornstalk XI. was doing the same
kind office for Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Queensland went to the w'ickets, and played amidst fall-
ing rain to the accompaniment of thunder. Hordern ancf
Penman bowled for N.S. W., and the Queensland innings
ended for 192. Saturday, although threatening, was dry,
and Monday was glorious. N.S.W. did slightly better
than the Bananalanders, scoring 208—16 more—for the
first effort. Queensland’s second innings saw 151 scored,
and the home team required only 136 to win. The
start was very unpropitious, three w'ickets falling for 13.
Then Pye and Barnes made 106 between them, and 138
were notched and the game won by four wickets. The
most interesting feature of the match was the success of
Hordern in the second innings, no less than six men being
caught off his bowling, w'hile he smashed two Bananaland
wickets himself. Of 24 overs three were maidens, and his
eight wickets cost only 81 runs. The other pair of sticks
were clean bowled by l’enman, who rocked in 161 overs
of w'hich four were maidens, and his two wickets cost only
34 runs. Which circumstance will probably be told witii
pride by his grandchildren.

Cricketer A. Diamond is evidently one of the
coming batsmen, and joins the exceedingly limited group
of men who have scored a century in their first Sheffield
Shield match. As stated elsewhere, he made 164, and by
the way he was shaping might have made a double century
but for the sad news that his brother had died suddenly
in Sydney on Saturday. He retired from the game.
Adelaide worked up the usual excitement over
the College match this year, the chief interest being as to
’what young Dolling would do for Prince Alfred’s College.
Last year he made 311, and his side won by an innings.
This time he made a century and 50 not out, and took 13
wickets. There was a strong newspaper agitation to play
him against N.S. W., but the selectors (Joe Darling and
two others) would not do it. Supporters recall that the
only two others to make really enormous scores in the
College matchs were Darling himself and Clem Hill.

“ B ” writes : The defection—forced and other-
w's,e-°f a large number of those players who have figured
of late in interstate cricket matches on the side of the
Ma State sets one soliloquising. For the second time of
late years during the long rivalry between N.S.W. and
Victoria the tally is level—37 each, and of the last eight
matches, Ma has won seven. This run of success has been
due largely to S. Gregory (once called Syd.), W. P. Howell
(used to be Bill), Kelly, Hopkins, Trumper (the “ Victor”
of fame), and Duff, former idols whose omission this year
has been hailed with glee. Should the Ma State get in
front this season the honor will be for the new brigade. I
am a bit of a new brigader myself, but pause to shed a
tear for the boys of the old brigade, who, as my friend
Ginger on the hill remarks, were a bosker push.

Tasmania, which has been a drought-stricken
land as far as promising cricketers are concerned for
quite a long time, has at last produced what it believes
to be a real good one. Bowling for Esk against Cornwall
in a Pennant match, one P. Darby took nine wickets for
seven runs off nine overs, five of which were maidens.
Then the Island took a long, deep breath, yelled for beer
and proudly announced that it had found the bowler
that was to come.

Sydney’s Prince Alfred Yacht Club was to have

The fina.l of the Syd. Flying Squadron’s handicap
on I ort Jackson, on Saturday, was completely spoilt by the
changing of the position of the finishing line from the
south to the north of Shark Island. The two preliminary
hfeats finished on the south side. The finishing line for
the final was changed without warning while the race
was in progress, and the deplorable bungle which fol-
lowed deprived the race of all interest.

Juggler Paul Cinqucvalli now carries a motor-
car round in his luggage. At Liverpool recently it was
running across the gangway on to a ferry boat when the
steamer started, and the car, containing a lady relative
of the great juggler and the driver, fell backwards into
25ft. of water, turning over as it fell. The occupants
were fished out uninjured. Had Cinque been on the car
he would probably have got ashore with the motor-man
in one hand, the lady in the other, and the wet motor
balanced on his ear.

The 100yds. Swimming Championship of N S W
was contested at Bondi Baths (Sydney) on Saturday
under the grey threatening sky and in a breeze that was
far from refreshing-. The event was considered a gift to
Cecil Healey on the strength of his performance at Bris-
bane, and it was fondly hoped by his friends that a new
record would be created. In the final the excitement ran
~ 1( ri at the turn for the second half it was seen
that Murray was 2yds. ahead of the champion and streak-
ing away gamely. Healey too seemed to recognise that the
positwn was critical, and he settled down to “crawl” for
all he was worth Slowly he gained, and as the race went
on the speed of the pursuer increased till with 25yds. to
go he was dead level with Murray. Latter pulled himself
together for a supreme effort, and for a while shore
through the water neck and neck with the champion.
Then Healey crept to the front, and Murray, weakening
was beaten by about 3yds. in 59 2-ssec., 2-ssec. slower
than the joint record held by Cavill and Healey
for the distance. J

Williams and Bill Lang leaned heavily on
each other for some 20 rounds of uneventful fight at the
newly-formed Olympic Club (Melb.), Monday evening last.
Ihe lighter Williams piled up points from the jump. His
dodging and footwork" were too disconcerting for his
bulky opponent, who repeatedly got tangled in the ropes
through no fault of his own. Referee Joe Stokesbury
gave a popular verdict when he declared Williams the
winner on points. A £lOO “ house ”, greeted the club’s
initial effort.

The person who pins his faith to “science”
alone against “brute strength” in the game of scrap
could have seen the foolishness of his belief demonstrated
at Sidney Gaiety Club on Saturday night, when Messrs.
Green and llanley squared up. Green was and is bantam
ch unpion, weighing 7st. 131 b., while Hanley turned the
sca.e a couple of pounds lighter, llanley had all the

skill, and he simply exuded science, and he finessed, and
lured, and baulked, and practised tactics galore. On the
other side, Green, showing hairy teeth, waved a couple of
furious frying-pans, and they hit Hanley twice. It was
enough. Science is no better than drivelling idiocy when
hit by meat and bone, and the slugged-out Hanley turned
it up at the end of the fifth round.
* * * *
The Squires-Felix scrap, at Sydney National
Sporting Club last week, was another exhibition of how
the man with force scrunches the man with skill but
without force, when he reaches him. Squires, the white
man, weighed only 12st. 61b., while the black with the
beautiful left kicked the beam at 13st. 31b. The white
man drove in, and smashing away at the black’s fists, beat
down his guard and bashed him on the throat and ribs.
The black s left pierced the white man’s g'uard again and
again, but he disregarded it, and springing in close
sledge-hammered the black man on to the ropes. Getting
up, Felix hit the white man every time, but that terrible
right white arm swung upwards like a pendulum, and
smote tne black in the stomach till lie fell with a crash,
and took nine seconds respite on the floor. The fourth
round saw tile black man open out with a series of beauti-
ful symmetrical lunges into the white man’s face, and he
brought an elegant right cross of infinite grace on to the
jaw, and avoided the stomach blows by skilful
footwork, and the dazed white man swung his left
crash on one of the ring posts. The fifth and sixth were
a repetition of the previous rounds. Science scored up
points galore, but nothing in the shape of a knock-out.
And the strong white man stood it all, and wiped the
blood and sweat out of his eyes, and waited grimly for
the opening to swing the hammer-like right. It came in
the seventh. Felix had hit him over the head with a
right chop and before the left could leap out Squires was
in close under it, and his right fist struck upwards three
tunes. The tall black swayed, tried to leap away, and
He was counted out without making the slightest
effort to rise.

The undignified squabble between Justice
Real and the Full Court recently, at Brisbane,
was vastly more insectarian than judicial. The
case was one in which Dill Macky’s Botchman
would have revelled. It lasted for days, and the
church stood out boldly in argument and.affidavit.
Real, who talked more than the rest of the Bench
and all the Bar put together, has become intensely
religious in his old age. During the case he heard
various kinds of bees and wasps buzzing about
his bonnet, and kept lashing out accordingly till
the Court’s dignity was very much shrunken.
The straw of consolation grasped at just now by
the public is that this indignant Judge is entitled
to his pension in about a year’s time if he cares to
retire.
“ S.” writes an obituary :
E. G. Fitz Gibbon, who has just abandoned the chair-
manship of Melbourne Metropolitan Board at the call of
Death, is well spoken of by the respectable press of his
State, and even the Age, which derided him long and
heartily while he lived and breathed and had his being,
finds him to have been a very amiable, excellent and
useful gentleman after all. No doubt Fitz. was a very
nice old man in his private capacity, but as a public
personage it is difficult to find anything agreeable to say
of the late Bard of Works that the Victorian public will
find convincing. He handled the Board’s finances like a
child ; was squeezed in London like a very Hayseed ;
selected the rockiest bank for his confidence when he
returned ; and mulled everything in Melbourne. There
is a general desire to heap honors on his head for his
noble work in preserving the public parks and gardens
from the vandals, but though he toiled hard in this
direction, the man who goes through the Yarra capital,
and sees how the great parks have been hacked about
and broken up with grants of patches to all kinds and
agglomerations of fat men, will sometimes wonder where
the White Knight’s success came in. Yet in this direction
he did his best.

BEAUTY is woman’s supreme prerogative.
Its possession means glory and power.
, Since the world began History relates
innumerable momentous occasions when
the Beauty of a Woman has swayed the
destinies of Empires. Poets have apostrophised
Beauty in all the ages; romance is full of the
same entrancing tale; artists have used their
best talent portraying the female face and form
divine. “Oh, give me Beauty for my prize ”is
the twentieth century aspiration of all woman-
kind. And so long as the world endures, so
long will woman take pride in preserving her
most precious possession, so long will men
admire that womanly charm, and so long will
Beauty remain a power in the world of
humanity. The woman of to-day, more than
ever, proclaims her wish to be made beautiful.
Man approves. In a hundred ways of expres-
sion he says in effect, “Pray, be beautiful.”
For centuries the ways and means have been
sought, and in every country of the world the
quest still goes on.
Mdlle. Rubinstein, who is responsible for the.
introduction to Australia of the Valaze Prepara-
tions, which, owing to their intrinsic value,
have had such a vogue during the past
few years, has just returned from a nine months’
trip to Europe, during which time she visited
all the leading Complexion and Hair Special-
ists in the principal cities of the Continent.
Although Miss Rubinstein’s faith in Yalaze was
unshaken, she was determined during her visit
to study, with an unprejudiced mind, all the
well-known systems and preparations in use on
the Continent, with the intention of placing
before her clients in Australia any that proved
to be better than Valaze. Miss Rubinstein's
faith in Valaze was justified, for after careful
and indefatigable inquiry she came to the con-
clusion-satisfactory to herself and to her
clientele here—that Valaze is the pleasantest,
the safest, the quickest, and the most reliable
skin preparation on the world’s market.
Ihe effect of the use of Valaze is certainly
magical. Wrinkles, Freckles, Tan, Sallowness,
Blackheads, Sunburn, Chafing, the ravages of
Time, Illness, or Weather, every Blemish, Dis-
figurement, or Imperfection imaginable disap-
pears under its spell immediately. The face
then becomes fair and radiant as a little child’s.
After regular applications, the skin assumes the
soft, dainty glow of perfect health and Beauty,
and an enviable brilliant complexion is secure.
Another good point about Valaze is that it is
absolutely non-hair producing. It is simply a
pure herbal food, which builds up the tissues
and nourishes the delicate pores of the skin,
preserving the youthful freshness indefinitely.
In fact, by its use one can defy Time in a great
measure.
Miss Rubinstein, on her recent trip, visited
Dr. Lykuski, the famous discoverer of Valaze,
in his home on the, Carpathian Mountains, on
the slopes of which 'the little herb grows that
possesses the marvellous properties in nourish-
ing, cleansing, and making the skin beautiful.
No man living holds such a potent secret—the
secret of perpetual Beauty—in the hollow of his
hand; no laboratory has ever seen an equally
wonderful discovery ; no similar boon has ever
been brought—ever will be brought—to the pro-
duction and perpetuation of Beauty in Woman-
hood than this marvellous Russian Skin Food
—Valaze.
This great discovery of the famous Dr.
Lykuski’s might have remained absolutely un-
known to the Women this end of the world had
it not been for the enterprise of Mdlle. Rubin-
stein, a Countrywoman of the famous Doctor,
who has brought it to the daughters of this Fair
Southern land. The debt of gratitude the users
of this marvellous Skin-food feel they owe to
Mdlle. Rubinstein is 'expressed in thousands of
letters telling eloquently and gratefully of its
skin-transforming powers. The writers of these
unsolicited testimonials can hardly find words
extravagant enough to express their astonish-
ment and delight at its Beauty-giving virtues.
Miss Rubinstein had another purpose in
going to Europe—to make a special study of
the skin and its treatment under the very best
skin specialists. She not only saw the leading
skin doctors established at headquarters, but
entered into negotiations for tuition and the
learning of everything that could be taught to
an expert. She not only studied, but had two
young Viennese ladies initiated into the various
branches of Massage as practised in the most
famous laboratories. The three boast certificates
proving the value of the close study with emi-
nent professors.
The result of Miss Rubinstein’s world-wide
investigations is the establishment of the Beauty
Institute at 274 Collins-street, Melbourne, where
a suite of five rooms are fitted up on the most
up-to-date Continental plan. The reception
rooms are charmingly artistic and beautifully
decorated ; the Massage Department is replete
w.th almost every rectifier that could possibly be
employed in the improvement or remedying of
the female face and figure. There are a wonderful
variety of instruments of ingenious contrivance
employed for the treatment of Wrinkles, Double
Chins, Superfluous Hair, Warts, and all other
blemishes. Besides, for the use of those who
are at too great a distance to visit the Institute,
simple and inexpensive Massage Rollers are
provided which can lie sent by post with full
instructions for home use.
“Did you find any good toilet preparations?”
Miss Rubinstein was asked.
“ Yes,” she replied ; “I have brought some
very good ones—plenty of Valaze, of course,
for there is absolutely nothing to equal it. The
new things include a preparation called
‘ Voskpasta,’ to be used in conjunction with
Valaze Herbal Soap, which will wonderfully
improve the skin and help to fill out hollows
and impart new life to the complexion. Another
is called Creme Promenade, to use when going
out by day and evening, which is most sooth-
ing, prevents any brownness or sunburn, and is
altogether cooling and refreshing. Then I have
a splendid cure for Blackheads and Open Pores,
prepared by Dr. Lykuski. This is a great boon
to Australian women, who are, unfortunately,
so frequently troubled with that complaint.
This preparation is guaranteed to speedily cure
the worst and most obstinate cases of Black-
heads.
“It is really wonderful what can be accom-
plished with these new preparations in conjunc-
tion with the Massage Treatment when it is
properly and scientifically applied, as it will be
here. Here is a special machine for curing
unduly flushed skins, or those disfigured by
blotches. We can cure red noses now by elec-
tricity, you know. This, here, is the latest
method for removing superfluous hairs. It is
quicker and less painful than electricity. This
is for the paraffin treatment, to fill up wrinkles
and hollows in the face and neck. This, again,
is for removing wrinkles by method of suction.
Have you heard of the peeling process ?”
“The peeling process?”
“ Yes, it is simply wonderfid; the skin is
removed wholly, not by any violent means, of
course, and you would be astonished to see how
youthful and creaseless the face looks after-
wards. It takes five days to do, and you must
not go out during that time. Nearly all the
European doctors have Private Hospitals, and
patients are treated there. No, I have not
started that, but we would attend to patients
at their homes.”
For use after shaving, Valaze is delightful.
Thousands of gentlemen use it regularly. It
allays any irritation shaving may have caused,
and leaves the skin cool and sweet and soft.
The fact that many of the most eminent
physicians and surgeons use Valaze is proof of
its soothing after-shaving properties. It is
pure, and it induces purity. Goes straight to
the spot, and works its way into the tiny pores
of the most sensitive, delicate skin. It is one
of the things that makes the morning shave a
pleasant matter. And when the Valaze Herbal
Soap is used for the shaving itself, followed by
the application of the Valaze Skin Food, the
comfort-bringing combination is complete. Men
who are more than ordinarily particular about
their facial appearance use Valaze.
There is an admirably-written and fully-illus-
trated “Guide to Beauty” Booklet issued by
Mdlle. Rubinstein on the subject of skin care
and treatment, containing valuable and most
practical knowledge regarding the complexion.
It is published at threepence, but a copy will be
posted FREE to anyone mentioning this paper.
In the booklet one learns much that is new and
vastly interesting. Mdlle. Rubinstein is im-
mersed in the subject, and she writes with
authority on all matters concerning toilette care.
Later on, Mdlle. Rubinstein intends to estab-
lish branches of the Beauty Institute in all the
cities of Australia and New Zealand. En-
couraged by the many inquiries from New Zea-
land, she intends paying that country of pic-
turesque scenery and pretty women a visit early
in 1906, and ladies there are advised to await her
coming.
The greatest tribute to the virtue of Valaze is
abundantly set forth in the thousands of letters
Miss Rubinstein has received from ladies in
every station of life and in every corner of the
world. It would be absolutely impossible to
quote at length from a perfect mountain of eulo-
gistic letters—letters that come as genuine ex-
pressions of gratitude and appreciation, but
here are some :
Newcastle Hospital,
Nov. 21, 1905.
To Helena Rubinstein.
Dear Mdlle.—l shall b' very glad to receive the
booklet and list of new goods. 1 must take this
opportunity to tell you that the Blackhead Cure is
simply marvellous. 1 had them very badly, and two
applications made a wonderful dilference. lam still
using it.
Yours truly,
FLORENCE McALLISTER, Matron.
Charlton, Victoria,
Feb. 14, 1905.
Dear Miss Rubinstein.—Please send me another jar
of Valaze. My daughter has had a rash on her face
for years, and I cannot say how many doctors she has
seen. I heard of Valaze, and she lias just used one
pot, and her face is quite clean.
Yours truly,
M. E. WILSON.
Castlemaine, Victoria,
Dec. 11, 1905.
Mdlle. Rubinstein & Co. —Kindly send me one cake
of Herbal Soap. Postal Note enclosed. I find your
soap very good for the skin, and will always for the
future use it.
Yours sincerely,
R. E. DINSDALE.
40 Burnett-street, St. Kilda,
November Ist.
Dear Miss Rubinstein.—Will you allow me to say
how highly I approve of “ Valaze,” Skin Tonic and
Soap—the first is not only pleasant to use, but of
signal service in counteracting the trying effects of
the Australian climate ; it is, in fact, a perfect skin
food, giving new life, strength and beauty to the skin
tissues. The Herbal Soap is the very best 1 have ever
used, and is so durable as to be really economical. It
should certainly be used in conjunction with Valaze.
The Skin Lotion, which is antiseptic and tonic, is
most refreshing and invigorating. With every good
wish for your continued success.
Believe me, Faithfully yours,
FRANCES E. SADLIER FORSTER,
Sec. Women’s Health Society.
Otago, New Zealand,
January 2nd, 1905.
Mdlle. Rubinstein and Co.—Would you kindly send
me two large jars of your marvellous Valaze. The
small jar you sent me simply worked wonders. I
have tried other preparations of so-called skin foods,
but they are not to be compared with Valaze.
Yours gratefully,
MRS. E. FITZGERALD.
Drouin, Gippsland.
H. Rubinstein & Co.
Dear Madam, —Kindly send one small jar of Valaze
by return. The result of the first jar is far beyond
mv expectations, and I shall recommend it confi-
dentially to all my friends. Trusting you and Valaze
may meet the good fortune you deserve.
Yours sincerely,
F. S. MURRAY.
“The Nest,” Leura, New South Wales.
To Mddle Rubinstein.
lam enclosing stamps for a second jar of Valaze. I
am pleased to say it has already made an improve-
ment in my skin.
Yours faithfully,
MRS. CLEMENTS.
Outtrim Park, Outtrim,
Miss Rubinstein. December, 1904.
Please send "me another pot of your Valaze, and
also one cake of the herbal soap by return. I have
used several jars of Valaze, and it has made a wonder-
ful improvement in mv skin.
DORA HART.
Singleton, New South Wales.
Dear Miss Rubinstein.
I do not think I could find words to express my
pleasure of Valaze as a skin food. It has made a vast
difference in my complexion, all the dark blemishes
entirely disappearing after a few applications. Will
you at your earliest convenience send me another
jar ’!
Yours faithfully,
M. L. VINES.

Thus a reliable correspondent :
I came, I saw, and was 90nquered. Being- out of health,
I went to northern Victoria for a change of air. Knowing
the magnificence of the Reform carried out by the people
of Kyabram, I went there. I was certain that the town
which reformed the whole Civil Service of Victoria, put
all the Government affairs in order, and generally cleaned
up the globe, must be healthy and well-kept
About 5 p m. a pale greenish-blue fog rose in the south-
west end of the town. “ All right,” said the Reformers
I felt curious, so went to see. A su.focating stench
met me. Some 500.vds. back of the town is an oblo»«-
dam, into which all the drainage of the community
meanders through unformed, clogged, weed-grown drains.
Ilus filth festers and stews in the sun ; it does not smell
—it emits a paralysing shriek of odor. Still the Re-
formers notice nothing amiss. Their latest move is to
reform the British navy and bring about a union of the
nations of the world —still their drains stink. Footscrav
is pure ozone by contrast.
The neighboring George-Turner town of Elmore, al-
though no larger than Kyabram, never thinks of Reform.
It quietly sewers its streets, provides a septic tank to
purify its drainage, and is healthy. Kvabram oives good
advice to the universe ; its foolish Ben Goddards and its
wooden Sammy Lancasters telegraph instructions to
r ederal and State Parliaments how to do thing's, and c* ve
to Bent and Go(i ; and the town fully believes that
if it had been consulted at the Creation it could have fixed
thmofs much better. And it smells like the accumulated
hogs of Christendom.
Goffs Harbor”: “Nulla” need not
worry his soul over the Dorrigo forest for many
a long day yet. The N.S.W. Department of
Public Works, pursuing the even tenor of its way,
deaf to the universal cry for land, is taking things
so easily that it will he years before the road is
finished, and the 141,000 acres of the Dorrigo are
locked up in the meantime.
There was nothing dilettante about the
Melbourne Herald of 50 years ago. Listen to
this (Oct. 2nd, ’55) about the House of Rich Land-
lords which was then much as it is now :
The purse-proud and official oligarchies which rule these
colonies have so contrived that no man shall have a
chance of representing the people unless he possesses a cer-
tain kind of money qualification, which will confine the
selection within the narrow and bigoted precincts of tl t r
own order. It is not money alone which these apes and
lickspittles of aristocracy have set up as a standard, but
money invested in a particular way—in a fee simple of the
value of £2OOO. .. . Has not he (a Councillor) the common
understanding to perceive that his projei t must lead
either to a sanguinary, ferocious scramble for the laigest
and richest slices of the public estate, or to a return to
that abominable and corrupt system of gianting land
which formerly prevailed in New'South Wales and made
every man in the colony the fawning, truckling slave of
the possessor of so much power ?
British M.P. Burgoyne coined a good
phrase in expressing the depth of contempt merited
by another member’s conduct. He remarked that
such behavior “would arouse the disgust of the
meanest menial in a Chinese hotel. ’

RADIUM WATER-CURE.— This is the greatest discovery
of the 20th century. It cures rapidly many of the so-called
“ incurable ” nerve disorders of man. It brings the curative
Mineral Springs to the fireside of every family. Radium is
proved to be the mortal enemy of disease and impurity, taken
into the human system in solution, it at once attacks the
diseased parts of the body, destroys the germs in the tissues
and in the blood, and restores the body to soundness and
health. The Radium-Charged Water, as used in the leading
hospitalsof the world, and by theFreemanand Wallacelnstitute,
will cure effectively where many other means absolutely fail.

The scrub land at Bangalow (N.S.W.), for
which £l7 per acre was refused the other day by the
beneficiaries in the Garvan estate, originally cost J. P.
(selected by the sons while the father was a
politician) £1 per acre. It transpired after the sale that
the reserve was £25 per acre—this for land on which
nothing had been spent in improvements. Cleared land
in the same district is valued at £3O to £4O per acre. The
scrub can be felled for £1 ss. per acre, and the stumps rot
away quickly, so that the selector does pretty well in this
country. Writer knows one man who went to that
district 20 years ago worth nothing. Now he owns in
one block 1000 acres, worth £3O per acre, valuable stock,
and a big bank balance. Yet in all these cases the State
did not get a shilling for betterment created by the rail-
way line. On the other hand, it has been actually making
roads for these people without any direct contribution
from them, because there is no system of local govern-
ment. A large area of this scrub land was dummied in
the early days, and is still standing with the original bush
upon it. A fat land-tax would shift something—if only
the virgin bush.
One of the worries which liquidators of broken in-
stitutions have to endure is the demand for dividends from
.British shareholders, who are unable to realise that they
are not depositors when there is 6d. in the £ to pay away.
Thousands of letters of explanation have to be sent out
every year, and, in reply to these, come shoals of corres-
pondence reflecting on the personal honesty of the
liquidators and making ribald references to* the Six
Hatters. The British mind hasn’t j r et grasped the fact
that it was the very crowd which is angriest about the Six
Hatters that boodled them out of the money they invested
in the boom period.
* * * *
In its “Memories of the Early Days” Melb.
Age gives an instance of the sweet profits the early land-
grabbers made—just as many of them still do. “In ’52
squatter T. Robertson bought a square mile on the Cam-
paspe. Of these C4O acres, bought for £1 an acre, he
fenced in SO acres and sowed oats. The land was splendid
meadow, requiring no clearing—nothing but the post-
and-rail fence. Prom these 80 acres he cut 100 tons of
oaten hay, which he sold to the Government for the camp
at Bendigo at £6O a ton 1 So inside 12 months he got a
square mile of splendid land for nothing and cleared over
£5OOO beside ! ”

J.A.I. ’: In your paper (12/10/’OG), in Answers
to Correspondents, is a reference to “ the crudely humor-
ous way you fixed up the stamps.” I have also met that
crudely humorous person. I was running a registry office
for servants some few years ago, and sent a young and
apparently intelligent chap to an up-country station. He
was short 2s. 6d. of his fee and I told him he could for-
ward me stamps out of his first week’s wages. In due
time I received a letter with 2s. Cd. worth of stamps on the
outside of the envelope. They were, of course, defaced by
the Postal authorities. I wrote to my client and enclosed
the envelope, telling him he should have put the stamps
loose inside his letter. Received a reply apologising for
his mistake, which he said was made through ignorance.
He added that he had now enclosed stamps as desired,
loose. He had, but they were the same defaced stamps.
He had soaked them off the envelope. In the face of
such overwhelming ignorance it didn’t seem worth while
pursuing the subject further.

“ Elmore ” : I stood on a corner musing sorrow-
fully on butter commissions, land agents, and such-like
things, when a young girl came along doing some crochet
work. The little white tag from her cotton reel fluttered
through her fingers and fell on the path a few feet from
me, looking very like sixpence. A stout, well-dressed
man came bustling along and he propped suddenly.
“Lovely morning,” he said, sidling slowly towards the
paper tag. “It is,” I answered, gazing over into the pub.
opposite. He gave me a quick glance and stooped to turn
up the base of his pants. Then he said “slam," or
something, and bustled onwards, without even bidding
me good day. Then a very stout lady came, and turning
her back on me started poking vigorously at the pave-
ment. “Young man,” she said, “I’ve dropped a coin !
Would you be so good as to pick it up for me ? ” Without
turning, I said, “ It’s only a paper tag, madam.” With a
withering look of scorn she passed on. The affability of
the people who passed me that morning astonished me,
and the bootlaces that came undone, and the sudden dis-
appearance of the affability when the boots were tied,
was bewildering. Finally the policeman came and made
one swoop. Then he straightened himself, and looking at
me severely, simply' said “ Git.”
* * » ,
“ Hiphen ” : At the fashionable lending library
where I get my supply of alleged literature, most ordinary
people find it difficult to procure the books they want.
The usual method is to hand over the list of books
desired, and if the subscriber does not happen to live in
Toorak or own a tote, the brazen-faced youth behind the
counter hands it back and remarks “Nunin !” Now, lam
neither a squatter nor a land-agent nor anything “class ” ;
still I get the books I want. Igo in, settle myself com-
fortably and fix the youth with a stony stare. Then I
start reeling off a list of the very newest books which he
has been instructed to reserve for Mrs. Fatman and which
I have no desire to read :
“ Have you the Nursemaids’ Dilemma ? ”
“No!” promptly answers the youth with the deal-
board face.
“ Lady Anstruther’s Appendix ? ” “NoI ’’
“The Duke’s Excitement?” “No !”
“ The Slavey’s Revenge ? ” “ No-o-o !! ”
“ The Moral Dilapidations of Elizabeth ? ” “ No-o-o ! ! ! ”
“ The Deterioration of Gwendoline? ” “ No-o-o-o !!! ! ”
By this time the flinty-faced one is somewhat rattled and
exhausted. Then I start on the books I do want. It
works like a secret commission ! With a sigh of anguish,
he dashes the rain from his brow and, diving into the
secret hoard, produces the volume he has been so valiantly
preserving for Mrs. Studsheep. Considering the time I
waste effecting this, it would no doubt pay me better to
buy the books outright. But what great victory has ever
been won cheaply ? Did not Wellington lose .-his life at
Trafalgar, and Malcolm M‘Eacharn his voice promising’
things to the constituents who wouldn’t have him after
all.

Australian Pharmaceutical Notes and News
(a paper that hopes to be quoted should really get a
shorter name !) gives one reason why the chemist, in some
cases, has to charge exorbitantly. He is blackmailed by
the doctor. It cites one case where the chemist, in order
to get the recommendation of the doctor, had to supply
him with certain goods free and allow him 50p.c. of the
price charged for prescriptions. Commonwealth legisla-
tion will shortly do away with such swindling secret
commissions.

“If you buy whisky by the bottle or flask,”
said the red-nosed man, “take my advice and go to a
publican who doesn’t know you. When he doesn’t know
you he doesn’t know but what you’re an official out to
catch him, and he parts with his very best. The watered
stuff he keeps for his friends. Common to hear a man
say he got rattling stuff the first time he called, but never
as good after. That’s why ; the publican knew at the late
visits there was no danger, and handed out the 10 or 15
per cent, watered variety. To be friends with a publican
is a mistake. Always go to a man as doesn’t know you.”
And the red-nosed man proceeded to walk a mile to find
a publican “as didn’t know him.”

“ J.T.Gr. ” writes the history of a First Family:—
“ In the roaring days, ‘ Happy Joe,’ otherwise Mr. Joseph
Scatterthorn, started a store at the diggings. Making
money, he bought bullock teams and carried his own
goods from the capital. Railways had not yet arrived.
Business continued brisk ; but ‘ Happy Joe ’ pined to
accomplish something special, and so he set about it. In
the city, where his credit was Al, he secured all the stuff he
could get, which was considerable, on tick. Later on,
when the wholesale people started to get rude and ask
for money, 1 Happy ’ played his trump. He announced
that everything—shop and contents, bullock teams and
all—belonged to Mrs. Scatterthorn. Now, the only cere-
mony in connection with Mrs. Scatterthorn’s installation
at the store was the handing over of one of ‘Happy’s’
teams to her ‘old man.’ When Scatterthorn went insol-
vent there was rather a big- row', in the midst of w'hich
the lady got so tired of it all that she went off to Sydney
with the head shopman and married him. She then re-
turned and took charge of her property. The old shop
has long- since given place to a pile of bricks coverin'"-
about half an acre ; but ‘ Happy Joe,’ now an ancient
and decrepit person, never passes that way—he lives in a
wattle-and-dab structure in a very back street.’

commenced the first bottle of your treatment. Almost
immediately I found that I had made a mistake by not
taking it before. lam now about half-way through the
second bottle, and so much do I feel relieved that I take
tills opportunity of sending this testimonial along- for you
to make whatever use you may think fit. I intend
continuing your treatment, and I trust that before I have
nms.ied the third bottle I shall be able to write to you
that lam perfectly cured. I am pleased to say the effect
has been wonderful.
Yours very gratefully, PHIL. HANN,

BRONCHITIS.
A South. Australian storekeeper testifies
to the Efficacy of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
A sufferer 70 years old cured by it.
Well and hearty now.
’ Hearne. Dear Sir, —I am a storekeeper
living in this township for the last 20 years. One of mv
oldest customers has been subject to Bronchitis for a
number of years, and has been in the hospital with it
several times. Hearing of your valuable medicine he
tried it, and found that it gave him great relief One
bottle was sufficient to put him right. This gentleman
is over 70 years of age, an old bushrnan who has been "in
these parts for the last 30 years, and is well known. He
makes my house his home when here, and got the medi-
cine from me. He is at my place now, and he says that
this winter is the freest he has had from Bronchitis for a
number of years, and he wishes to return you thanks for
your valuable Bronchitis Cure. He is well and hearty
now. You are quite at liberty to publish this or anv part
of it you like, as it may be of g-reat benefit to other ueonle
suffering from Bronchitis.—Yours truly,
M. GOGLIN, Storekeeper,

CONSUMPTION-
Too ill to leave his bed.
A complete cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir,-l am writing to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be con-
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
you* Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed,
but I commenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. I am glad to say that the two lots of medicine
you sent have effected a complete cure, for which accept
my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR,
Westminster-bridge Road, S.E., London.
Distressing, suffocating, dry cough for twelve
years.
Entirely removed by five doses of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
No other treatment could even ease it.
Sir, My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from most
distressing, suffocating, dry cough, that could not be re-
moved or even eased by any remedy, doctors’ prescrip-
tions and patent medicines having been tried ; but I am
happy to state that the cough, pain in the chest, and dif-
ficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by the
fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure. —I remain, sir, yours
most respectfully,
WILLIAM CROCKETT,
Baker’s Swamp P. 0., via Dripstone, N.S.W.
A five years’ case cured by one small bottle
of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Kindly send me one
large bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. I am more than
pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a
small bottle cured my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.
—I remain, yours respectfully,

IS LIFE WORTH LIVING?
(BY “PHILO.”)
To almost everyone there occur times when the question whether life is worth living thrusts
itself upon them, but there are, fortunately, very few who come to a negative conclusion and decide to
anticipate nature by hurrying “ behind the veil.” x ~ , t ..
To those in the possession of buoyant health the question occurs but seldom, but there are so
many people who are never in thorough health, and others who suffer from pain and sickness, that to
them—the far larger class—the vital question is apt to intrude itself with persistency.
It is remarkable how many people suffer from pain and sickness which they could readily be cured
of if they were aware of the cause of their trouble. Of course there are diseases which cannot be cured,
but such disorders as rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, lumbago, backache, sciatica, blood disorders,
anaemia, indigestion, biliousness, jaundice, sick headache, general debility, gravel, stone, bladder
troubles and Bright’s disease are all curable. One and all arise from a diseased or inactive condition
of the kidneys and liver. When the kidneys and liver are working actively and in harmony, uric and
biliary poisons are thrown off from the system in a natural manner, and as it is the presence of these
poisons in the blood which causes the suffering entailed by any of the complaints mentioned, the
removal of the poisons means the subsequent cessation of pain and suffering. ...
The kidneys of the average person filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine
cverv day In this quantity of urine should be dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten or twelve grains
in weight of uric acid, and other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly
an ounce. If the kidneys are working freely and healthily all this solid matter leaves the body dis-
solved in the urine, but if, through weakness or disease, the kidneys are unable to do their work
properly a quantity of these urinary substances remains in the blood and flows through the veins,
contaminating the whole system. Then we suffer from some form of uric poisoning, such as
Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago, Backache; Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia, Gravel, Stone,
and Bladder Troubles. A simple test to make as to whether the kidneys are healthy is to place some
urine passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand until next morning. If
it is then cloudy, shows a sediment like briekdust, is of an unnatural color, or has particles floating
about in it the kidneys are weak or diseased, and steps must immediately be taken to restore their
vigor or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some of the many manifestations of uric poisoning will result.
The Liver is an automatic.chemical laboratory. In the liver various substances are actually made
from the blood. Two or three pounds of bile are thus made by the liver every day. The liver takes
sugar from the blood, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it
to the blood, as the latter may require enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble,
into urea which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles which have
lived their life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from some
form of biliary poisoning, such as Indigestion, Biliousness, Anaemia, Jaundice, Sick Pleadache,
General Debility, and Blood Disorders. . , ~ , , ~.
So intimate is the relation between the work done by the kidneys and that done by the liver, that
where there is any failure on the part of the kidneys the liver becomes affected in sympathy, and
vice versd It was the realisation of the importance of this close union of the labor of these vital
organs wliich resulted in the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as Warner s
Safe Cure Certain medical men, knowing what a boon it would be to humanity if some medicine
could be found which would act specifically on both the kidneys and liver, devoted themselves to an
exhaustive search for such a medium, and their devotion was eventually rewarded by their success in
compounding a medicine which possesses the required quality in the fullest degree. Warner s Safe
Cure exhibits a marvellous healing action in all cases of functional or chronic disease of the kidneys
and liver and restoring them, as it is able to do, to health and activity, it, of necessity, cures all
complaints due to the retention in the system of urinary and biliary poisons. A vigorous action of
the kidneys and liver naturally eliminates the poisons, and troubles due to the presence of the poisons
cease. Cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent, simply because they are natural. [6

INDIGESTION - comprises many ailments, has many varied symptoms.
Pain after food, relieved slightly when wind is rifted, a feeling of
sickness if awakened suddenly; headache; a bad taste in the mouth ;
the recurrence of food; heartburn; sleeplessness—all these, or any of
them, may be present. They all mean that the digestive organs are out
of order, and need a little help to get equal to their work. Bile Beans
give that help, and tone up the digestive organs so that they can do
their work properly. “My hus-
band was troubled with Indi-
gestion,” says Mrs. G. Willoughby,
of Buckland-street, Alexandria,
Sydney. “ After a meal, his food
would lie heavy on his chest, and
it would seem to rise, and a nasty
taste come into his mouth. He
also suffered from heartburn, and
felt drowsy, and unfit for work.
V
His sleep was disturbed, and altogether he was in a wretched state
of health. Bile Beans were recommended to him. Speedy relief was
the outcome of the first few doses, and which was shortly followed by a
complete restoration to health. I find Bile Beans also suitable for myself
and children when we feel out-of-sorts, and I never lose an opportunity
of recommending them to others.”
BILE BEANS are obtainable from all Medicine Vendors throughout Aus-
tralasia, price Is. l|d. or 2s. 9d. large box (containing three times Is. 1-gd. size).

The Train That Never Was
Booked.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHAT ! she ain’t a-goin’ as fast as you
padded the hoof up East ?
Well, it isn’t as slow as that, you
know, not by a yard at least;
You see we can shake her a good old pace from
Woolgangie to Gnarlbine Rocks,
But to take her quick this side of that would give
the Service shocks.
We might give her a twist in the noon-time sun on
these claypans you see so far
But if we steamed her so in the night we’d be
frightened by every star.
So at night when we’re westing to Southern Cross,
we calm her across the plain
With the headlights trim and the lookout sharp
for the ghost of the Unbooked Train.
“So they made for this length a ‘ Service speed,
though I laugh at the thing myself—
At the thought of crawling a hundred miles like
a sticky fly on delf—
At wasting steam for a phantom train that’s said
to be lost on the road,
And may turn up any time to collide with me
and my blessed load.
But still ! they’ve made a ‘ Service ’ speed, and,
phantom train or no,
We run that speed from Gnarlbine Rocks to the
Soak at the Cross below.
And we crawl in the dark in a weary way —for the
records were never cooked
To account for the loco, that never arrived —the
train that never was booked.
“ The tale ? There’s not much tale to tell; but,
anyhow, here it starts :
When Bullabulling had got the rails as the
furthest in Eastern parts,
The Beverley loco., ‘K 24,’was booked out one
night last year
With a compo. van and two empty trucks and the
tanks, and she left all clear.
Due at the Cross next day at nine, and then to be
loaded back
To Gnarlbine Rocks with contractors’ stores and
rails for the Hannan’s track.
Well, they booked her out, but she never booked
in—next day no ‘ 24 ’
Steamed to the cleaning sheds of the Cross, nor
watered her tanks at The Bore-
Booked out all right with her compo. van, but
never booked in again ;
And that’s why they say she’s lost on the track,
and call her the Phantom Train.
She was driven that night by George R. Sims,
and fired by his cousin John,
And they with the cab of ‘24 ’ and her brazen
dome have gone.
We traced her down to the 30-Mile, where she ran
away from her guard,
But from there she seemed to be lost in air, or
melted into lard ;
And the 30-Mile is where we slow as the start of
that engine’s loss,
And the affidavits of all concerned say she never
went past the Cross.
An emergency man—a driver —tells a yarn that
at Doodlekine,
At one in the morn of that pregnant night, he saw
drawn up on the line
In the siding a loco., like ‘24,’ waiting for him to
pass—
But the man who’d say she could go that length
in the time is drunk or an ass.
He didn’t stop to see if the train was real, for the
grade was steep ;
But it sounds like the yarn of a man on a burst or
the tale of a kid in his sleep.
“And I said so too, till at Mingenew, on my
holidays last week,
I got a fright that near froze my blood. I tell yer
I couldn’t speak,
For there, though I hardly believed my eyes till I
looked, and looked, and looked,
Were Sims and his cousin, who drove and fired
the train that never was booked.
Well, they seemed as scared as I did of them, but
I shouted them both a drink,
And I said, ‘ Now, what’s the game, old man ? ’
and I gave ’em a cheerful wink—
And I told them how careful the lengths was run,
and the slow down after dark ;
And they laughed till the tears ran down their
cheeks—they thought it a lovely lark.
And they plucked up heart and they told the
yarn which I’m telling just once again—
The tale of the loss of ‘ K 24’ and the myth of the
Phantom Tram.
“Says Sims: ‘We booked out at seven fifteen
with only one train to cross —
The Perth mail down at the 30-Mile, and that’s
where began the loss.
The Perth mail down was late that night, and we
made good time to the loop,
And she let off steam in a muffled cough, like a
giant sick with croup.
It was just a windless, star-dark night, with only
a thought of rain,
And I went to the shanty to get a drink, and the
guard stood by his train.
I was having my rum when up there stepped a
man, strong-built and young,
With an eye that would dare a dozen hells, and,
my oath ! what a taking tongue.
In a minute he’d got me fair by the wool, in two
we were like old friends ;
And then he out with a scheme for me to help
him in one of his ends.
“You’re bound,” says he, “to trust your mate,
but the guard must stay on here,
I want your train when the mail goes through to
steam like hell, and clear ;
By the dawn of the day, ten hours from now, you
must cover the Northam points.”
I said, “ Great Scott ! it can’t be done—there’s no
ballast laid on the joints”—
But he lays his hand on my arm and says : “You
must do it, my friend, no kid,
And if we steam to the Burlong Pool you own
this five hundred quid.”
“ ‘Well, I hummed and hawed, but I heard the
mail come shrieking along the plain,
And I said “ All right ” and we both sneaked back
in the shade of my stolen train.
I took him up on the tender then, and he lay face
down on the coal,
And I says to Jack, “ Don’t talk, you fool, for the
sake of your sinful soul,
I’ll tell you all when we males a start —fill the fire-
box full to the bars,”
And just then the mail came dashing up and her
chimney paled the stars.
And as soon as she passed, I whistled the guard
and I says to him “Go back
To the shanty by—there’s a sick girl there who’s
got to go down the track.”
Well, he grumbled a bit, but the trick came off,
and he did just as I said ;
And as soon as he’d gone we up with the brakes
and gave the machine her head.
She rose to the steam like a fish to the fly, and she
thundered along the road
Where was never an ounce of ballast laid, and I
prayed for a larger load.
Her lubricators, they swam in oil, and we fired her
often and hard,
And at ten miles out we three sat down and
laughed at the swindled guard.
At twelve we breasted the Southern bore with the
lights all masked, and slowed ;
And crouched in the shade—so the ghostly
train crept over the ghostly road.
Asleep as of old was the station, housed in a fog
as thick as moss,
And we shook her again at a half-mile out when
we’d crawled past Southern Cross.
She shook like a leaf under all that steam —I
thought she would jump the rails —
Making thirty miles on a ten-mile road—but old
‘ Beverley ’ never fails.
In the nick of time I recalled the card —the mail
would be on the line,
And we masked her fires again in the loop at the
siding of Doodlekine.
In the nick of time we crossed the points, and.
running where we had been,
Dashed the mail—and the face of the driver seeing
the train that never was seen.
When the stars sailed down to the dawn, we sped
through Northam and past the Pool;
We had stopped but once to cross the mail, and
once for a box to cool;
We left him an hour ere the Albany mail was due
at Spencer’s Brook—
And he gave us the gold (and money is money,
clean got, or got on the crook).
And we steamed her back to the ballast pits, and
left “ K 24”
Half hid in scrub new-grown on the track, and
grass to the furnace-door.
And we struck out West for the Midland line, and
got away safe to Cue,
And we’ve bought a sliicer and floated it, and I’m
“ Mister ” to all but you.'
So I says to him : * George, putting money aside,
’twas done from a kindly heart.
I s’pose his missus was dyin’ out East, and that’s
what made him part.’
‘ Not much,’ says Sims, ‘he wanted the mail —
he told us along the line—
He was scooting like hell for the English boat—
he was going to float a mine.’
“ So that’s why we shake her a good old pace from
Woolgangie to Gnarlbine Rocks,
But to take her quick on the West of that would
give the Service shocks.
So at night, when we’re Westing to Southern
Cross, we calm her across the plain,
With the headlights trim and the lookout sharp
for the ghost of the Unbooked Train
That stands on the line that's been long disused—
unknown by the men who’ve looked,
For the loco, lost somewhere East of the Cross—
the train that never was booked.”

RANDOLPH BEDFROD.
A Cup Comedy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN HE was a clever woman. Not one of
the booky ones who heave their cleverness
at male inferiors, but one of those women
whose talent goes unsuspected, consisting as it
does of a genius for correct estimate of the
respective value of individual curves. If a woman
isn’t pretty according to the rules of the society
for relieving men of their assets by forging a
complexion, she must possess a certain sort of
cleverness if she has decided to live nicely and
walk in purple.
She was married and had her Friend in due
course. In her set, no self-respecting woman
ever seriously went in for the study of Plato until
this picturesque background was sketched in.
Like the rest of her class, she sniffed the air when
her moral raiment came into proximity with one
of the unsuccessful of her sisters, but she had
absolutely no scruples about accepting money
under false pretences from two men at the same
time.
The situation was possible only because her
husband loved her to foolishness and her friend
had no sense of proportion. She continued to
divide honors for twelve months successfully.
The husband thought how good she was; the
friend, how adorable. She preferred to be ador-
able, so neglected the goodness.
She was entirely a product of the Smart Set.
The Melbourne Cup was to be momentous for
Her and Him—not him.
They had arranged to realise the true ideals of
platonic friendships—if his horse won. It would
be a matter of twenty thousand—one could buy a
lot of things besides respectability, she reflected.
Besides, the situation was becoming unendurable ;
it was simply absurd to expect a brilliant young
woman to put up with it any longer. And fancy
an old age in the suburbs —and him and one maid !
And one seldom has friends after thirty-five.
* * * *
Her husband had also backed a horse whose
success would mean ten thousand. She sneered
gently : “ Imagine you winning anything, you
dear old simpleton!” He patted her hand lov-
ingly and looked wise.
The Cup was heralded in by a brilliant day
trimmed with gold. The lawn was a royal spread
of green, relieved by half-tones and pastel shades
of feminine loveliness and otherwise. The race of
the day was in progress. She and her husband
stood together on the lawn, straining their eyes
after different horses. The third in the comedy
stood some distance away, alternately watching
her and the horse.
A moment of tense silence, and then a mighty
roar : “Wombat has won ! ”
It was her husband’s horse. She turned to him
with shining eyes. “ Dearest, let us go home ; I
want to hug you.”
“Dear little wife,” he said; “best little wife.
It is all for you.”
She smiled up at him.
Her friend watched them get into the cab and
drive homewards—her hand nestled in her hus-
band’s.
Thus is virtue rewarded.

to follow. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are endorsed by
friends and neighbors, by people you know.
You think Backache comes from fatigue. Sometimes it does. But ,
when it comes again and again, it is Kidnegache. The kidneys lie under the
small of the back, and a pain in the kidneys is felt in the small of the back.
SYDNEY WOMAN CURED OF
BACKACHE and KIDNEY TROUBLE.
Mrs. M. Mullins, 49 Iliinter-street, this City, says:—“For about three
years I suffered with kidney derangement. The worst symptom was a constant
backache, which became more painful whenever I stooped much. I tried many
remedies for this complaint; but the results were anything but beneficial.
However, Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills permanently cured me. When I say
‘cured,’ I mean that it is oyer twelve months since I used these pills, and I’ve
had no return of the old pain. I have advised many people to use Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and some have obtained very good results from their use.”
Mrs. Mullins informs us that she is still well. She says : —“ I have never
had a sign of the complaint since. They are splendid Pills, and have made a
great difference in my health. My permanent cure, for it is over five years
since I used the Pills, speaks for itself.”

DOAN’S OINTMENT,
ITCHING PILES CUHED.
Mr. Edgar Wood, Engineer, Randwick
Tram, whose private address is 23 Young-
street, Redfern, says : “For seventeen years
I suffered with itching and protruding Piles.
During that time I was treated by several
well-known Sydney doctors; i also tried
chemists’ prescriptions and remedies adver-
tised t> cue this complaint; but nothing
g ive me the slightest relief. The irritation
was so ;r at that it caused me annoyance and
inconvi nie ice during the day, and kept me
awake for hours at night. I almost despaired
of ever getting anything to relieve me, as I
had experienced so many failures. How-
ever, I saw an article in the paper stating
that Doan’s Ointment had cured a Sydney
man who had suffered for twenty years with
this complaint. lat once got the Ointment,
and I am pleased to tell you that the first
application gave me relief. I continued
u nrig it, and am now perfectly cured, and
t i's means a lot to me, and is wonderful,
considering I had been afflicted for 17 years.
Since my cure I have recommended Doan’s
Ointment to other sufferers, and I will
always do so. I wish you to publish par-
ticulars of my cure for the benefit of other
sufferers who do not know the value of
Doan’s Ointment.”
ECZEMA CURED.
Mr. H. Watson, Alfred-street, Annandale,
this city, says: —-“A couple of years ago I
had eczema break out very badly on my
chest. It was shortly after a trip I took to
India with horses, where 1 contracted fever,
the eczema seeming to me to be the result of
this sickness. It started severely, and spread
rapidly, until I was in such a bad state that
the irritation nearly drove me mad. When
I went t' bed at night my sufferings were
worse, and it would be nearly morning before
I conld get to sleep. A fellow I know ad-
vised me to get .Doan’s Ointment, saying that
he had heard of great results gained by using
this prepar it, on. I thought it a good idea, and
obtained a pot. The first application was
cooling, and the second soothed the itch, and
after that I got along splendidly ; every time
I applied the ointment there was a marked
improvement, until I was quite cured.
Within a month from the first time I used
the ointment, not one trace of the ailment
remained. am twelve months cured now.
Doan’s Ointment is a splendid preparation
for eczema, skin irritation, and to take in-
flammation from the skin, and to heal.
Doan's Ointment is splendid in all diseases
of tiie skin, eczema, piles, hives, insect bites,
chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe, and very
effective. Very often two or three pots have
cured chronic cases, which have resisted
other treatment for years.

REMEMBER THE NAME -DOAN’S.
Selling Mangles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
808 TRAVERS was smart. He had
need to be. Plunkett and Co., mangle
and sewing-machine importers, had no
use for a canvasser who was not. Business was very
slack one atternoon when the Boss sent for
Travers to his private office, and asked him if he
knew Agincourt Alley.
For answer, Bob Travers bared his fore-arm
and proudly displ iyed three variegated scars.
“When I was hawking Players’ machines,” he
explained laconically. The Boss uttered a grunt
and continued. ‘ 1 here was a woman in here
last week—a Mrs. Delaney—after a mangle. By
some unaccountable means she got away without
buying ! ” The Bxss spoke in tones in which sur-
prise and annoyance were blended. “We hear
that Ritchie’s have got hold of her, and we want
you to go down and bring her in before they
finish her. You bring her in, dead or alive—we’ll
do the rest.”
“Very good, sir,” answered Bob Travers, con-
fidently. “Dead or alive ; leave it to me.”
Five minutes later he was in the street, waiting
for a tram-car.
He got off at the terminus and strolled leisurely
down towards Agincourt Alley. Then suddenly
his alert eye saw something in the distance that
made him quicken his pace and breathe loudly
through his nose, while the battle-light showed
fiercely through his small, red eyes. There, in
the distance, was his hated rival, Smithson,
Ritchie Bros.’ smartest and most trusted traveller.
Bob Travers turned down the alley at a run,
dashed into the yard of Mrs. Delaney’s dwelling,
and battered impatiently on the door.
There was no answer.
He rushed to the gate and peered cautiously
down the alley. The unsuspecting Smithson was
not yet in sight. Travers dashed back to the
door, and knocked once more desperately. At all
costs he must gain admittance before his rival saw
him. He was seriously contemplating staving in
the kitchen window, when the door cautiously
opened a few inches. Like a flash he inserted his
boot in the aperture, heaved with his shoulder
against the latch, sprawled into a dishevelled
apartment, and banged the door behind him.
Before he could offer a word in untruthful ex-
planation, “ wop ” came something into his eye.
Instinctively he backed into a corner and pro-
tected himself with a chair, pending the return of
his eyesight. After a few moments the astrono-
mical complications cleared off, and he beheld the
youthful daughter of the house preparing to renew
hostilities with the large mop. With a glib
longue and half-a-crown he convinced the Amazon
of the purity and honesty of his intentions.
Assured that he was neither a bailiff nor a tax-
collector, the young lady dropped the broom and
fastened on to the coin, which she bit, rung, and
tested by various methods till, satisfied of its
genuineness, she dropped it down the neck of her
exceedingly loose and grimy bodice.
“Y’ve jist missed me muvver,” she informed
him. “ She’s this minit gone down to see a noo
mangle at Ritchie’s. She’ve got the green dress
on an’ the ’at wif ther feavers,” she added with
infinite pride.
But Mr. Travers had heard enough. He dashed
out of the house, sprinted down the unkempt
yard, swerved round the corner, and went crash
into the portly form of the astonished Mr.
Smithson and fell on him heavily. He picked
himself up, glanced hurriedly at his semi-uncon-
scious rival, forgot all about his hat, and rocketted
down the alley. He reached the main street just
in time to see a large, green-clad figure step on to
a tram some few hundred yards off. He pursued
it for some distance, yelling, whistling and gesticu-
lating wildly. But the tram-man was deaf, or late,
or independent, or something, and Bob Travers
was left hatless, dishevelled and cursing in the
middle of the road.
The reappearance of a highly excited and pro-
fane Smithson spurred him into further action.
He flew across to a cab-rank, where two hansoms
and the same amount of decrepit horseflesh were
drowsing. No one was in sight save Smithson, but
loud laughter and the clinking of glasses from the
pub.-house opposite betrayed the whereabouts of
the jehus.
It was no time for hesitation, so, clambering on
to the aerial seat of one of the ramshackle vehicles,
he awoke the outraged beast tethered thereto with
the butt end of the whip, and drove off citywards,
large and free, in pursuit of the green figure on
the tram-car. Now, Mr. Bob Travers knew less
than nothing about the management and guidance
of horses. He admitted himself that he was better
at driving a bargain than a cab. Still, beyond
upsetting a paper stall and running over a dog
and a, cyclist, he managed very well for a beginner.
By dint of unflagging application of the whip on
the animal’s protruding ribs, he overhauled the
tram-car just at the approach to the city.
The lady of the green dress was sitting peace-
fully on the dummy when he drove alongside and
attracted her attention by leaning perilously side-
ways from his swaying perch, and tapping her
gently on the hat with his whip-handle. She
looked up and shrieked.
“Be calm, ma’am, be calm!” gasped Mr.
Travers. “I am a friend—from Plunkett and
Co.—steady, you brute—of 143 Swine-street,
agents for—the celebrated —Esiwuk—man—gles.
I warn you—don’t go to Ritchie’s —come to us
and ”
There was a terrific clatter behind, Travers
looked round just in time to see the other hansom,
driven by the enraged Smithson, charging down
on him at a gallop. There was a grating of
wheels, a whirr and a crash, and two hansoms and
a tram-car went over together. Then all was
dark.
Travers was dazed and almost blinded when he
regained consciousness. There was something
heavy lying all over him. It was Smith-
son and another corpse. With a superhuman
effort he disentangled himself and looked
round. Busy policemen were holding back the
crowd, rescuing the wounded from under the
mass of debris, and taking the names and
addresses of the slain. Travers, with dogged
determination, staggered to his feet and, clamber-
ing over the prostrate form of his late cab-horse,
surveyed the scene. A tangled mass of green
drapery caught his eye close at hand. He hauled
himself painfully to it. It was his quarry.
“I warn you, ma’am, not to go to Ritchie’s,” he
said as well as he could with two broken teeth.
The green mass never moved. With superhuman
strength he picked it up in his arms and staggered
over the heap of splintered tram-car, cab-liorse
and slain and wounded. He pushed his way with
his prize through the crowd and sank down with
it in the gutter. The warehouse, by superlative
good fortune, was not far distant; he could even
see the Boss watching from the doorway. The
cool moisture of the gutter revived him, and,
grabbing the unresisting female by the neck of her
green costume, he hauled her with his last remain-
ing strength along the pavement and lurched into
the Boss’s arms.
“Dead or alive, you said,” he gasped. “Here
she is.”
Then he swooned away.
When he came to it was to find the Boss’s angry
red face and tangle of white whisker confronting
him.
“Dead or alive!” he gurgled once more in a
dazed though proud voice.
“Dead or alive, be damned!” shrieked the
Boss. “ You've brought the icrong woman! ”
Then Bob Travers swooned again.
* * * •
The accountant was waiting for him when he
recovered with a neat packet containing two days
and five hours’ worth of wages. The packet also
bore the legend in red ink, “ Services no longer
required.”
Then, slowly and sadly, Bob Travers, broken in
more senses than one, limped out into the street,
where the Law was seeking him.
ALF BRACH.
The Camel and His Driver.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IVrOT generally known that most of the
I far back pastoral country would be un-
occupied at present but for the use of the
camel. Formerly, when seasons were good, horse
and bullock-teams were numerous. Up here at
Farina, in the far north of S. A., where the prin-
cipal road into Queensland branches off, there
would at times be from 30 to 40 teams camped,
waiting for loading; and on the road to Inna-
mincka, and thence into Queensland, you could
make sure of meeting four or five teams every day.
Now, in that district, you could travel for a
month and not meet one. Their place has been
taken by the camel, which doesn’t mind a day or
two without water, although if he’s watered regu-
lai-ly every day he will look for it.
A camel will carry from 4cvvt. to lOcwt. Cows
average 4cwt. ; bulls from scwt. to lOcwt.,
according to size. Also according to ownership.
For, if the camel is his own, the Afghan will stack
on all he can carry ; but if the animal is yours,
and the Afghan is working for you, a quarter of a
ton is his limit, even if the beast is as big as a
house. It saves a lot of work in unloading and
loading night and morning. Distance travelled
per day averages 15 miles loaded; 20 miles
“ empty.”
Most of the camels are Afghan-owned and
worked. Wages in this district are £4 to £5 per
month with rations. Thanks to the immigration
laws Afghan workers are rather scarce, and wages
are high. A lot of them returned to their own
country for a space, and were confronted with a
language test when they tried to come back. Now
some of the big owners are going to use their
camels in waggons and have whites to drive them,
in consequence of the scarcity of colored labor.
The Afghan may go on the “ bust ” in his own
country, but he certainly doesn’t do it here. His
yearly account with the storekeeper consists of a
shirt and trousers, two yards of calico for a turban,
and a pair of ten-shilling hobnailers. The more
extravagant ones indulge in a stick of tobacco
occasionally. Their smoke procedure consists of
one or two deep inhalations, through water for
preference, the smoke being drawn right into the
lungs, and allowed to filter out as it may.
The Af. abhors pig, and will not knowingly
carry bacon in his loading, so the accursed thing
usually figures on the waybill as “ Groceries.” I
knew a case in which the “ Groceries” fell off,
and, breaking open, disclosed two lovely sides of
bacon. The Af. left them where they lay, and on
his return paid for them without a murmur, but
he would take no more loading from that store.
The Af. will not take interest on his money-
Numbers of them bank in the Savings Bank, but
refuse to take their interest. Although hardly
any of them can read or write they can reckon up
their wages and accounts very accurately. They
are great borrowers and lenders ; nearly all have
a promissory-note or two flying about.
Camels will pull more than they will carry, and
working them this way dispenses with loading
and unloading every halt, and enables stuff to be
conveyed that could not be carried in back-loads.
Camels will not, however, make more than 10 or
12 miles a day “in harness,” and they take a
lot more driving than bullocks. If you don’t hit
them hard and often enough they won’t pull, but
if you hit them too hard (in hot weather) they
will lie down. You want to strike the happy
medium as well as the camel. Also you want to
have the constitution of a camel yourself to stand
the smell of the brutes.
The driving in waggons is all done by whites,
and the camels so used are, so far, white-owned. It
is too like hard work for the colored gent. A driver
recently told me he had driven his team nearly
3000 miles within the year, but out of that dis-
tance he hadn’t been able to ride 10 miles on the
waggon, because if the driver even starts to fill
liis pipe the camels stop and look back to super-
intend the operation. They are worked without
winkers, though sometimes a blind is put on the
rear eye of an extra lazy one. They will pull as
many times as you can belt them up to it, unless
the weather is very hot, when, as has been said,
they will lie down.
The white man will never care for the camel as
a charge, because he bites, strikes, kicks, and
stinks, and wanders too far over-night. Never-
theless, he can travel and work where the horse
and bullock would die.

Impure blood is the cause of very many of the ills to which
flesh is heir. Ayer's Sarsaparilla purifies, vitalizes and n-
riches the blood, as testified to by Mr. W. J. Pickering, Store-
keeper, Breeza, N. S. W., who sends his portrait and tells the
following interesting story:
IV
s -I
“In the year 1890 my ankle
broke out, and I went to a
doctor, who told me 1 was
suffering from blood poison-
ing. He prescribed for me,
but did me no good, and I
tried several other physicians
without benefit. went into
St. Vincent’s Hospital, Syd-
ney, and, after a few months’
treatment there, came out
worse than ever, feeling
greatly discouraged. I suf-
fered terribly for four years,
until my wife, hearing of
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm aaa msmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmammsammHm
got me a bottle. She persuaded me to give it a thorough trial. Soon
I noticed that the sore on my ankle began to heal, then the pain dimin-
ished, and after a course of six bottles I became as well as ever I was
in my life, and I remain in the best of health.
“ Everybody for miles around here knows what tribulation I went
through. 1 now recommend Ayer's Sarsaparilla to all who suffer from
impure blood, and I am glad to say that it has done good to all who
have tried it.”
Be sure you get the original AYER'S Sarsaparilla. See
that the name—AYER'S SARSAPARILLA—is on the wrapper,
and blown in the glass of each bottle.
