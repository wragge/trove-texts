The Red Page
Thomas Dekker
Among the flickering, uncertain, mothlike
figures which circle round the flame of
Shakspeare’s genius' is one Thomas Dekker,
journalist, gaolbird and whilom dramatist.
His works have suffered the devastating cor-
rosion of time. The chill winds of oblivion
have blighted much that was fair; and that
which remains has come down to us stained
with the dust of years, scattered in old books,
corrupted in clumsy printing, and exhibiting
in quaint conceit the stilted grammar and
bizarre spelling of the period.
That Dekker lived solely by his pen is a
fact less doubted than established. It is
possible that his father was a shoemaker,
or that Dekker himself had been apprenticed
to a shoemaker in early life; but whatever
his humble occupation, it is certain that he
left his trade to follow the Muse’s beckoning,
and the fruit of his imagination had to serve
as his daily bread. A spendthrift genius,
his lesser works are undoubtedly the mis-
carriage of nobler aims blighted or curtailed
by the rude buffetings of fate. Baptised in
the Phlegethon of adversity, Dekker knew
poverty at first hand and gaol from the in-
side ; he knew the down-at-heel feeling of
destitution, and suffered the humility of the
borrower. Yet he carried his cross courage-
ously. In brighter days he mixed with the
rollicking tavern troupe and the jovial wits
of the “Mermaid.” He enjoyed the intel-
lectual companionship of liis equals and the
flattering homage of lesser scribes. The joys
of creative invention were his: his also the
divine gift of Song, untrammelled and unpre-
meditated ; and, singing, he reached ecstasy
and knew the “j’lory that is brighter than the
sun.” So in tlie tragi-comcdy of liis life he
learned tolerance and a sympathy for all
men ; and. though his plays exhibit strange
contrasts of inspiration and triviality, his
verse is instinct with humility; and gentle
and smiling are the words with which he
unpacked his heart.
When Marlowe died, like a setting sun,
leaving his trail of glory in the sky, play-
acting became the vogue in London, and the
demand for plays rose out of all recognition.
Many which were bought by producers and
actor-managers were the hurried productions
of journeymen dramatists. To piece together
and patch-up the ragged imperfections of old
plays was a commission often undertaken by
Dekker. His hand is to be traced in many
collaborations with Chettle. Hauglitou, Day,
Massinger, Ford and Rowley. Of his own
plays, in “The Pleasant Comedy of Old For-
tunatus,” written at the instigation of Hens-
lowe, Dekker has taken an old German
legend and embellished it with all the poetry
at his command. The play as it stands in
the original quarto of 1600 shows him in his
most expansive and fluent vein. It is rich
in metaphor and bold in imagery. It indi-
cates the desires of men; it smiles at their
follies. The poetry is gay and sparkling like
the music of Mozart. “The Shoemaker’s
Holiday” is a comical sketch of middle-class
London life, exhaling the homely philosophy
of mental and physical contentment. Here
Dekker propitiated the dimpled music of
comedy, and his laughter is as contagious as
it is honest. But “The Honest Whore” is
his dramatic masterpiece, with its pathos of
thwarted passion and the charm of its inno-
cent nakedness. The theme, the conversion of
a courtesan, is as old as the Pyramids, but
Dekker has developed it with rare contra-
puntal cunning, raising a sordid subject into
the high sphere of art.
Words came easily and ideas never failed
this ragged beadle of Apollo. True, his
promise always outshone his performance,
yet his plays, lacking in construction, want-
ing the cohesion of great dramatic execution,
contain many scenes of animated action
which here and there proclaim the true worth
of the dramatist. Gleams of fugitive poetry
shine at* short intervals through even his
hastiest and most slipshod work. He had a
dancing wit. He knew gaiety; but he knew
sorrow also, and when the curtain of con-
tentment was roughly torn aside 11 by fate, he
viewed the sordid turmoil of the world with
sadness and surprise. Then he would utter
his indignant declamations, and the tender
voice of a baffled song-bird would sound in
pathetic undertone through his bitter-
freighted words. He had been tricked
many times by “this strumpet world,”
but the weight of his misfortunes
never dragged him down—his torch was
“ne’er extinguished with his tears.” Dim
bodings darken his pages but rarely. He
sees the proud man persecuted and the sage
crucified and the gilded fool at play with
his gauds. He sees the fair shield of virtue
smirched by traitorous hands, and every
noble aim shot at with darts of derision.
He sees the mockery of life, but he sees the
comedy of it also. Possessing a bounteous
tolerance for all things human, he learnt
to suffer fools gladly, and delighted to launch
his most lecherous jests at the thickest skulls.
Dekker lived always in the matrix of
hurrying and insistent life. He belonged to
the town, to the narrow and crooked streets
with their high-gabled, red-roofed houses and
Tudor towers and projecting signboards. He
knew no snobbery. He was at home with
the wits and the strolling players; he frater-
nised with hprse-thieves and courtesans and
men of turbulent blood. All types were
caught in the cobweb of his daily life, and
reproduced in his prose works and pamphlets.
“The Gull’s Horn Book,” “The Seven
Deadly Sins of London,” “A Rod of Run-
aways” and “The Bellman of London” —to
mention the better known of his pamphlets
—give us some very humorous insights into
the lives of gallants at the taverns and play-
houses in England’s historic city.
Happy and irresolute by nature, he stitched
rhyme to a couplet, mended a metaphor, em-
broidered a sketch and drove the polished
bodkin of wit through the quilted costume
of comedy. He improvised with ease, and
working always against time, under the
shadow of the sheriff’s officer, and with cork-
ing cares oppressed, stayed not to soften
the harshness of a rhyme, nor to polish the
crudity of a phrase. His elegance was hap-
hazard. He seemed iucapable of self-criti-
cism, and so it is easy to point to his faults
and blemishes—easy to carp and cavil at
the incongruities and inconsistencies in his
plays. But when the severest critic has
done his worst, there remains much to praise
in the work of this kind-hearted poet —much
that will live in the sunlight for ever, as in
“The Virgin Martyr,” “Old Fortunatus” and
“Patient Grissel,” where inspiration’s very
dawn resides in such music as holds the
lutanist enchanted.

Jekyll and Hyde in Science
Science is sometimes- represented as a
woman with a lamp in her hands, and the
sciences have certainly done much to lighten
the darkness of ignorance and superstition.
This Jekyll side of science is too well known
to need elaboration. Like religion, it has
its martyrs and its devotees; and, like
religion, it is ever seeking something higher
than itself.
But in one branch- of- science we distinctly
recognise the presence of both Jekyll and
Hyde. “Apes with all science in their
hands,” as Mr. Britling called them, did not
cease their search for super-means of destruc-
tion when the Great War ended. So diligently
have they gone on with their deadly work
that they now claim to possess a formula
for poison-gas capable of wiping out the
population of London in an afternoon.
Future wars will be in the hands of chemists.
But there are other habitues of the labora-
tory who affirm that in 50 years chemistry
will have exterminated disease. Will Dr.
Jekyll have time to wipe out disease before
Mr. Hyde wipes -out the white races with
poison-gas ?
It is not only in chemical laboratories that
Mr. Hyde makes his presence felt. Putting
on one side the broad issue of the justifica-
tion or otherwise of vivisection—from the
utilitarian point of view, a question impos-
sible for the layman to decide —the fact re-
mains that in certain laboratories of the
world things take place which, from an
ethical standpoint, are damnable. Among
scientists the question of benefits accruing
from the practice even of normal vivisection
is a debated one because of the difference be-
tween the response of animal and human
organisms, animals physiologically closest to
man, anthropoid apes, being rare and costly.
Sir Frederick Treves admitted that his ex-
periments on the canine bowel unfitted him
to deal with the. human bowel, but success in
other directions probably kept him with-
in the ranks of the vivisectionists. Claude
Bernard, some of whose experiments may
fairly be classed as abnormal, wrote: “Sans
doubte nos mains sont vides aujourd’hui,
mais notre bouce pent etre pleine de legitimes
promesses pour l’avenir.” And this after
nearly a lifetime spent at the practice of
the grossest form of vivisection!
How does lie attempt to persuade these
promises to materialise? His “gospel” in-
cludes the precept that “a vivisector is no
ordinary man. He does not hear the animals’
cries of pain. He is blind to the blood that
flows.” Claude Bernard makes free use of
the drug curare, the effects of which he
describes as follows: “In this motionless
body, behind that glazing eye, and with all
the appearance of death, sensitiveness and
intelligence persist in their entirety. The
corpse before us hears and distinguishes all
that is done around it.... In a word,, it has
consciousness and volition, but it has lost
the instruments which serve to manifest
them. Death under the influence of this
drug is accompanied by suffering the mo,st
atrocious that the imagination of man can
conceive.” Picture your favorite dog,
acutely alive to sensation, but dead to all
means of expression, and at the mercy of
Claude Bernard. Then thank God that he
is no ordinary man! Among his inventions
is an oven in which dogs and other animals
are slowly baked to death while an experi-
menter watches through a window. Mephis-
topheles feeding the fires of Hell while the
damned shriek for mercy is expurgated from
enlightened forms of belief. Yet the twen-
tietli-centurv vivisector watches through a
window while an animal as highly organised
as a dog dies slowly in a torture chamber
that is surely part of Hell.
Poe’s Tales of Mystery and Imagination
fade into insignificance before articles appear-
ing in some of the physiological magazines of
to-day. There you can sometimes read horror
piled on horror until you begin to question
the sanity of what you perhaps believed to be
the sanest thing in the world —science. You
can leave your Poe on the bookshelf and
harrow yourself with Pawlow’s description of
his own method of obtaining gastric juice
from dogs. You may read of the infliction of
prolonged torture for the sake of ascertain-
ing how much pain an animal can endure
before death intervenes. You will surely
forego tales of mystery for such vivid reality
as the description of the setting on fire of a
fully-conscious dog, previously soaked in tur-
pentine, and the subjection of other animals
of the same species to atmospheric pressure
intense enough to stiffen their bodies and
melt their brains. Iu these terribly true
physiological stories unchloroformed dogs
are skinned alive and kept alive until death
(whom we are in the habit of stigmatising
as cruel!) ends their torture. Tales of the
kind prove that the spirit of the Inquisition
still lives. This time it haunts the altars
of science, instead of the altars of religion,
and its victims are defenceless brutes, unfor-
tified by the vision of an ideal.
Even if we accept the doubtful axiom that
the end justifies the means, Claude Bernard’s
confession robs the means of its one shred
of justification. It is time we gave up our
dreams that all vivisectors are as merciful
as possible and that morphia, ether and
chloroform are freely used in all laboratories
where animals are sacrificed to science. It
seems that a diabolical love of torture in-
spires some of the torments to which brutes
are subjected in countries that are sup-
posed to reverence the teaching of the all-
compassionate Christ. Physiologists as well

I. WILKINSON.
Anatole France at Ease
It was in 1903 that a young man hailing
from Languedoc—lie was then 21 came to
seek his fortune in Paris. His name was
Jean-Jacques Brousson, and he was fresh
from the University with some knowledge
of the classics (he regarded Anatole France
as a classic) but with little knowledge of
contemporary literature. One day, armed
with a letter of introduction to the famous
writer, ho wended his way to the Villa baid,
absorbing numerous cups of coffee, cn route
to nerve himself for the ordeal. In this way
an acquaintance and collaboration began
which was to last for about six years. Brous-
son’s position was that of secretary, and he
soon became indispensable in the carrying
out of the great work that Anatole France
had been engaged upon at intervals for more
than 20 years. lie was at once introduced
to the famous history of Joan of Arc. Josc-
phine was summoned by a furious ringing ot
the bell, and on appearing she was. told to
bring in the bag. This turned out to be
a sort of mattress which had remained m
a garret for months, and which weighed over
60 kilogrammes. “Do you know what this
bag contains, young man?” said the Master
grimly, and enlightened him by adding: It
is the MS. of ‘Jeanne d’ Arc.’ ” Brousson
found notes written on all sorts of fragments
of paper, envelopes, postcards, old letters,
tradesmen’s bills. There were innumerable
newspaper cuttings, and a heap of copybooks
in a cloth fastened by safety-pins. He treated
his secretary to a discourse on his methods
of composition, and the part played therein
by paste and scissors. “I am like Renan,
in this respect,” lie explained. “The author
of ‘La Vie do Jesus’ scribbled anything that
came into his head, and sent it along to the
printer. He got busy with proofs, until at
the fifth correction the writing began to look
like Renan’s.” Anatole himself required six,
seven or even eight corrections.
“Q'ue voufoz-vom?” he would say. ‘ I am
supposed to have no imagination, but I have
a lot of patience. You think, my young
friend, that an angel inspires me, and. that
I can produce pages and chapters in a
moment. I have rarely felt the breath of
inspiration, and ray pen is anything but lyric.
It doesn’t leap, but plods along in a very
commonplace, humdrum way. I have never
felt the intoxication of creative effort. I
write painfully and laboriously. If anybody
.asks me for a hundred or a hundred and fifty
lines I ask him which he means? There is
a vast difference between them. I am like
a schoolchild kept in to do an imposition.”
He believed that the semi-colon ought to be
abolished. It was useful in the age of com-
pliments, in speeches and funeral orations,
and marked the repose of the period; but to-
day we lived at a quicker pace, lie abhorred
long sentences. The shortest was the best.
His rule was to avoid too long and too melo-
dious sentences. They may lull at first,
but, eventually, they send the reader to sleep.
He was careful of his adjectives, and remem-
bered that Voltaire had said that, although
the adjective agrees with the noun in gender,
number and case, nevertheless they don’t
always hit it. What was the use of multiply-
ing adjectives in order to say the same thing?
“Do not,” he counselled, “entirely neglect
a negative epithet—it has its uses, and some-
times its effect is wonderful. For instance,
don’t write ‘les allees sans fours,’ but ‘les
alU.es defouries.’ ” It is the meringue which
hides the poorness of the cake: it spoils the
finest pages, and on it the first wrinkles
appear. He was. he owned, addicted to la
patisserie in his first versions of “Jeanne d’
Arc,” which were written for devout people.
Tie wanted to be picturesque. lie walked
in Jeanne’s’garden and culled the many-
tinted flowers, and even bit into an apple,
lie called that “pastry,” and asked for the
scissors in order to cut out the fruit and
flowers. When a thing has been well said
there is every reason, he thought, why it
should be adopted and copied. Give refer-
ences? What’s the use? Either your read-
ers know where you have cribbed the pas-
sage and the precaution would be useless,
or they don’t know. A reference would offend
them by exposing their ignorance. Here is
a golden thought: “Caress your sentence for
a long while, and it will smile upon you in
the end.”
Brousson tells a story of how the bath at
the Villa which was too big for the bathroom
was used as a depository for the books and
pamphlets which his employer was unable
to read owing to their dulness. A bookseller
was sent for to take them away, the price
agreed upon being 50 francs. “He could
have asked a hundred easily enough,” said
the great man. He was astonished when
he received 50 francs from the bookseller.
In Anatole France cn Pantoufles (Cres.
Paris) Brousson has accomplished his task
with the faithfulness and exactitude of a Bos-
well. and Paris is expecting a second and even
a third instalment. There was a journey to the
Argentine which must be full of “copy.” In
that country there was some sort of a quarrel,
and the result was that Brousson was com-
pelled to come back to France without his
companion. He was deserted. Perhaps that
is one reason for the occasional bitterness
that one finds in the book, and why it is
so overpowcrihgly frank.
L.G.D.
Advertisement’s Artful Aids
In Publicity That Pays (Gay and Han-
cock, London) Leonard Summers gives adver-
tisement almost a pivotal position in politi-
cal economy. It is, he seems to say, a part
of productivity, so precise in its percentages
as to be nearly a science; if not economically
essential for all time, psychologically essen-
tial here and now. .The casual reader is un-
likely to leave the eulogium without being
impressed. It may even make him appre-
ciate better than before Hamlet’s sarcasm on
Horatio’s limited philosophy. Such amazing
things had surely never been dreamt ot bj
him! ...
As a contribution to commerce most busi-
ness men will esteem the little book the
better because it is not literary. Its plain
sense is redolent of the self-made merchant s
“Letters” ; but in nothing else are the two
comparable. What impresses at first are
the strong claims made by big minds tor the
value of advertising; and, secondly, what
sets one gasping are the stupendous results
from the recipes. In the last category a
rattling rhyme tells the whole truth:
If you are wise, you’ll advertise,
Don’t heed what sceptics say;
The only doubt that will arise
Is just this: “Will it pay?”
For answer, reason out this way
(Ignore the cynic’s sneers):
“If advertising doesn’t pay,
What makes the millionaires?”
As to testimony, Sir Charles Iligham con-
siders that advertising is the greatest pro-
fession ; witness its worth in war in recruit-
ing and in raising millions of money, bays
he- “An advertising man is a scientist even
as a surgeon is In time, advertisers will
become the world’s schoolmasters. Hold
Burnham declares that “advertising is the
master key of modern trade.” Sir Woodman
Burbridge (Harrod’s) says that among all
modern forces for business development
advertising stands first and foremost. (Bur-
bridge’s firm spent over £140,000 on adver-
tising during 3919, and increased its turn-
over by £1.850,000 on the previous years
trading.) Mr. Kellaway, Director ot the
Department of Overseas Trade, asserts that,
“British people are the finest producers ot
goods and the worst salesmen.” That ‘Bri-
tain is far behind the times in advertising
knowledge” is a discovery made by \\ilson-
L a wren son (World’s Ad. Club Convention).
“The plain truth,” lie adds, “is that 80 per
cent, of British business men do not under-
stand the elements of publicity, so cannot
grasp its immense possibilities.” •
The figures given to substantiate the
opinions of the foregoing and of men like
Sir Robert Horne, Licut.-Col. Amery, M.F.,
and Mr. Carnage are colossal. Win. }\ lute-
ley, Sir .J. Lyons and “Toffee King” Mackin-
tosh are cited as three who made advertis-
ing “the serious business which it really
is” and gained fortunes out of small be-
ginnings. When Day and Martin Were about
to go into liquidation through having dropped
advertising, the widespread advertisement ot
the situation dramatically rescued the firm
at the eleventh hour. Lord Rotliermere says
that, advertising creates a valuable asset—
goodwill—’(‘which may quite possibly be
worth more than the whole of the plant.
On the question of cost the economics are
astounding. T. .T. Barratt (rears’ Soap),
after spending three millions' in 23 years
on ads., certified that they then sold soap at
over 30 per cent, less than the price charged
without advertising expenditure. With in-
creased trade through ads., sales expenses
decreased despite tremendous competition.
The cost is comparatively small. An investi-
gation in 1917 bv the Department of Busi-
ness Administration. Yale University, showed
an average of only 5.2 per cent, of the turn-
over as the advertising expense of 90 national
advertisers. These are figures relating to
some of the industries: —

A newspaper man experiences a pardon-
able pride when it becomes plain that news-
paper advertising is the wise way to finan-
cial achievements, and that it cheapens cost,
to buyers. Sir Frank Bowden (Raleigh
Cycle Co.) affirms that the cycle trade and
industry could never have been built up with-
out the papers. Sir Hall Caine concludes
that “newspaper advertising is generally the
most effectual, the widest in its range, the
most immediate in its effect, the most direct
in its appeal.” The compendium indeed
proves that the advertiser as such does not
get money at the expense of the public,
wealthy as advertising may make linn.
What advertisement does in detecting
crime, in finding missing persons, etc., is
supported by evidence and the views of Mr.
Justice Darling and others. How the bulk
of postal revenue .is derived through the
enterprise of advertisers is established. lor
the man of business there are useful
“points” on the psychology of the problem,
on the treatment of copy, on the feminine
“orgy of acquisition” known to the big dress
houses, and on the utility of brands and
trade-marks.
“Publicity that Pays,” one conceives, is
but one of many humble predecessors of
tomes on the grand scale. The theme will
possibly have its great hours like Pragma-
tism. Relativity. Coueism, Psycho-analysis
and Co. There is already a Publicity Club
in London, and it is intriguing to read that
at a meeting in April Sir Charles Higham
held that the only way to put off the next
war was by publicity. In an impassioned
address lie claimed that the League of
Nations would never be an effective instru-
ment until it called in the ad. men. A dozen
such “could boil down the whole League of
Nations’ case to a thousand words, which
the multitudes in every land would be will-
ing to read.” The business of ad. men, he
added, was to clarify thought.
Strange to say, these potentialities had not
hitherto alarmed one’s complacent journalis-
tic contentment. Is our century to shoot up
ad. writing as the Newest Journalism?
R. S. Ross.
A Satchel of Books
The Brand of the Beast, by Michael Lewis (Allen
and Unwin). An open and avowed shocker. Sensation
right off the oven.
Bullwhack Joe, by R. B. Townshend (John Lane).
“Bullwhack” is American for “bullocky.” A
collection of short stories, marked by a vivid and
dramatic presentation which holds the reader’s
interest.
The Half-Loaf, by Agnes Mure Mackenzie (Ileinc-
mann). “Half a loaf is better than no bread’
said the Wise Man. The Wiser Man lifted eyebrows
and said “Always V” A conventional story of simple
lives in tranquil days.
The Motor Cycle Overseas Annual (Iliffe & Sons).
An English publication designed to form a link
between the British manufacturer and motor-cyclists
overseas. It contains a body of information useful
to owners of motor-cycles and prospective buyers.
The Boy from Bullarah, by Arthur Wright (State
Publishing Co.). This latest addition to the Book-
stall series of novels deals with the adventures of
a bush boy who becomes a professional boxer. It
moves briskly through an atmosphere of pugilism,
racing, cinema actors, criminals and love-making.
The House of Madame Tellier, by Guy de Mau-
passant (Lawrie). The greatest of French short-
story writers is not as well known to this generation
as he deserves to be. If this cheap edition does no
more than to revive an interest in his little master-
pieces, it will serve good purpose. The volume under
notice is the fourth of the series, and the work of
translation is competently done;
Still More Prejudice, by A. B. Walkley (Heine-
mann). Delightful essays on art and life by an
Englishman whom the American Nathan described as
the finest critic writing to-day. Both men have the
same viewpoint, though their approach is widely
different. Walkley is as refined and gentle as the
other is bawling and Rabelaisian. In the long run
the Englishman gets home the shrewdest thrusts.
My Marne is Legion, by Charles Morgan (Heine-
mann). A decidedly promising first novel. 1
used to think that the love of man and woman was
a barrier to the love of God —a w'all between the l *
spirits and the universal spirit. Now 1 know that
it may be not a wall but a window. This ex-
presses the inner meaning of a carefully-thought -
out but somewhat complex plot. A capital piece
of work. _
Mount and Man, by M. F McTaggart (Country
Life). This well and copiously illustrated book is
put forward by the author, a British cavalry officer,
as “a key to better horsemanship.” He comes to
the task well equipped as an accomplished horseman
and horsemastcr with wide and varied experience.
The two main points laid down by him in the ait
of successful riding are balance and sympathy, ine
book is essentially one for the English horseman, who
attaches more importance to his seat on the animal
than we do in this part of the world. It, howevei,
contains some hints by which Australians may piofif.
Out of the Past, by Margaret Symonds (John
Murray). This volume of the correspondence of
John Addington Symonds complements the admirable
hioinanliv by H. F. Brown, disclosing through the
sympathetic medium of his daughter the inner
domestic life of one who adorned the literature of
the later part of the Victorian era. Symonds was
never a popular writer in the sense of one who
appeals to the world at large The earlier editions
of his works are long out of print. One or two
editions have followed the first, but only among
scholars and lovers of exquisite prose have they
any present-day sale. •
Doughty Heeds, by R. B. lunninghamm Graham
(Ileinemann). An account of the life of Robert
Criliam of Gartmore, drawn from his letter-books
and correspondence. The book covers the greater part
of the eighteenth century, and, apart from its abstract
of the life of a poet and politician, gives the leader
an interesting insight into the then administrative
policy and methods of the Crown in its Imperial
possessions abroad. For some years Doughty Deeds
exercised the office of Receiver-General of the Taxes
in Jamaica, and his life there constitutes. the most
interesting part of this old-time record.
The British Drama League Library (Basil Black-
well) Plays selected for publication by the Reading
Committee of the League. The collection includes a
masque in classic setting, a ballad opera, religious
and secular dramas and modern comedy; and the
outstanding specimen is “The Web,” by T. Stirling
Boyd, the motive of which is to show how, through
some mischance, a man may be convicted of a crime
of which he is guiltless. The work is obviously from
the pen of a writer well acquainted with the principles
of criminal law, and with a little simplification in
technical details and some reconstruction for theatrical
effect should make a' fair bid for success on the
stage.
A King in the Making, by Genevieve Parkhurst
(Putnam’s). This American volume is offered as the
“authentic story of Edward, seventeenth Prince of
Wales.” “When news is at the peak of its abundance
and the papers are beyond further gorging with world
crises falling Cabinets,” and so on, says the writer,
“but let the Prince of Wales affect a new color
in ties, dance a new dance, or smile at a new girl,
and he at once becomes a florid headliner.” The
lady appears to have made a, very thorough search
for material out of which to weave her chatty
panegyric and one closes the book with a ‘ thank
God” that common humanity has not to live up to
the high standard imposed on the affable and pleasing
young man. The book is well produced and profusely
illustrated.
Contemporary British Composers, by Joseph Hol-
brooke (Cecil Palmer). “The men who are able to
put our music forward without bending the, knee to
foreign produce are few; but w 7 e have them. Ih u ®
Holbrooke, himself a composer and a vigorous writer,
as this book shows. “There is no audience for native
music in England,” he continues. “An opera, by an
Englishman means an empty Opera House. hoi
this newspapers are, in a measure, to blame, since
they serve up “appalling dope,” and “often label the
moribund, the tiresome, the dull and the hopeless
as masterpieces.... The general trend of our populai
journalism is to give hearty headlines to foreign
visitors and treat the native product as a quantity
neither valuable nor interesting.” Of course, this
never happens in Australia. The author goes on to
analyse the work of representative composers ol
British origin. These he divides into three classes,
placing Edward Elgar, Granville Bantock, John Ire-
land, Cyril Scott, Vaughan Williams Arnold Bax,
Rutland Boughton, Frank Bridge and Havergal Brian
in the first group. The principal works ot each
of the composers in the three groups are distinguished,
apart from a complete list, and comments of value
to music-lovers follow. A very interesting book,
handsomely illustrated. *
“MD”- “8.D.0.” is right about the ballroom
incident, or the lack of one, on the eve of Waterloo.
Thomas Hardv, who is worth 100 Byrons foi
accuracy—lie even puts an accent on the ein
Napoleon—gets out of the difficulty by leaving out
the date in “The Dynasts” when he lays the scene
in “A Ballroom in Brussels.” It is just a June
midnight at the Duke and Duchess of Richmonds.
Wellington, having remarked that Nap. has gained
a good 21 hours’ good march on him, calls for a
map and says:—
“I have bidden my army concentrate in strengtn
At Quatre-Bras. But we shan’t stop him there,
So I must fight him here.”
He marks Waterloo on the map with his thumbnail.
Strange to say, the ballroom, though so famous, has
never been located with certainty.
“C.N.”: The oldest and the quaintest book club
in S. Aus. is the Adelaide Book Society, founded in
1814 The original membership was limited to 24.
at which figure it still stands, despite the ever-
increasing “waiting” list. As a vacancy occuis
death is the usual cause—the committee elects a new
member. The Governor, as patron, first receives a
hook; at the end of a week he is required by the
rules to pass it on to another member, w'ho in his
turn hands it to another member, and so on until
every member has read the book. At the end of
each year the books are auctioned among the mem
bers and the proceeds used for purchasing new
volume's.

A Legacy from the Inventor

With the dream of his life realized —
William Seward Burroughs did not find a
world eager to give up the laborious, in-
accurate pencil and scratch pad for his new
adding machine.
But the inventor overcame this obstacle
as he had so many others. To convince
business men of those that his machine
was accurate and easy to operate he left it
on trial. Thus the business man was able
to determine for himself whether the ma-
chine was practical and if it would do, in
actual operation, what its inventor made it
do in his demonstration.
Right from the start the trial method was
successful. And William Seward Burroughs,
before he died (1898), saw this machine prove
its own value in the hands of business men.
And to this day, the Burroughs Company
continues to employ this trial or demonstra-
tion idea—this legacy handed down from
the inventor —to modern business. It places adding ma-
chines on fiee trial, where the work is simple and no in-
struction is needed. In other fields—where bookkeeping,
calculating or duplex machines become a part of an
improved method—it is Burroughs policy to make a
thorough analysis of the work to be done, and then make
a recommendation.
Why not avail yourself of this service to-day?
Let a Burroughs representative analyse your par-
ticular work. Let him show you how others in your
line of business are saving time and money in handling
the same kind of work. There’s no obligation—yet his
suggestion may mean a saving of hundreds of pounds
to you every year. Simply fill out and mail the coupon.
A Burroughs repre-
sentative will be
pleased to show you
how you can use Bur-
roughs Machines to the
best advantage in your
business.

The Phaeton
Power Without Precedent in
the New Chrysler Six.
It’s no trick to build a car that will go 65 or
70 miles an hour if it has a power plant big
enough to haul a goods train.
It’s a great achievement to get over 70 miles
an hour out of a motor of 3-inch bore and
4f-inch stroke, with a petrol mileage safely
above 20 miles per gallon.
And that’s the wonder of the Chrysler Six.
Before it was made available to the public,
the Chrysler was given thousands upon
thousands of miles, and months and months
of the most heartbreaking tests.
The story of two years of road-testing the
Chrysler is a story of human and mechanical
adventure as thrilling as the movies.
Repeatedly, on the Ligonier Mountain, the
Chrysler ran rings around big, expensive,
supposedly high-powered cars. It went past
them so fast on those murderous grades that
they looked as though they were tied.
And when they finally pounded their way
to the top, in “second’’ or in “first,” the
conversation would be something like this:
“Say, what car is that?’’
“Sorry, but we can’t tell you. It isn’t ready
for the public yet.’’
“Well, it’s good enough for me. Here’s my
name and address. Keep it, will you? And
when that car is announced, write me. I’m
going to have one of those.”
That happened not once, but many times.
But prove it for yourself.
Take your own high-powered” car out on
your favorite hill—and we hope it’s the
fastest car and the steepest hill you know.
Then do the same job with a fully-loaded
Chrysler. We know the result now, but we
want you to know it.
Such a test is a revelation of what real
science in engineering, manufacturing and
selecting materials can accomplish.
Of course, you don’t want t® drive your
Chrysler over 70 miles an hour. In fact,
you may never go that fast.
But there is something you do want every
minute and at every speed that only a speed-
ability of 70 miles an hour can give.
That something is sure, steady power for
steepest hill or deepest sand. It is pick-up
to flash you out of a traffic tangle before you
can say “Jack Robinson.” It is sturdy,
dogged pull, so you can throttle to five,
three or two miles an hour on high without
“bucking.”
That’s Chrysler performance in a nutshell.
Another of the Chrysler wonders is that you
feel no strain or tension at 60 or 65 or 70
miles an hour.
The smooth, vibrationless power torque is
constant. Never was there such a steadily
progressive power curve.
And the riding quality is perfect—no bounc-
ing around the road.
1 he Chrysler has such a low centre of gravity
that it seems to flatten down at high speed
like a greyhound after a rabbit.
Chrysler pivotal steering, with spindles
operating in ball bearings, is also as easy at
70 as at 17. You never find yourself clutch-
ing the wheel. You don’t have to strain to
keep your Chrysler on the road.
For the first time, as far as we know, here
is a car whose performance carries no quali-
fications.
Please read that again—no qualifications.
And best of all, you can stop even quicker
than you can speed up in a Chrysler.
Chrysler-Lockheed hydraulic 4-wheel brakes
give the ultimate degree of safety. They
are soft, positive and easy to apply.
They are the final touch of scientific engi-
neering in this wonderful car.
But Chrysler superiority doesn’t stop with
phenomenal performance. It goes deep
into materials and manufacturing. No car is
built of finer material; no car is built to finer
standards. The result is quality throughout
which is as extraordinary as its performance.
You should certainly try out the Chrysler.
That’s the only way you can fully appreciate
it.

VARIOVS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Square Peg and the Round.
When John McCosh went on the spree
He left his wife at home;
Said he: “The Lord He made man free,
And gave him leave to roam;
The Lord was very wise,” said he—
And blew upon the foam.
“xhe Lord was wise, and more than wise,
When He made human kind ;
For one the road where’er it lies,
And one to stay behind;
For one to chase the hour that flies,
And one to sheaf and bind.
“The Lord was very wise,” he said,
And leaned above his beer,
And every loafer raised his head
That he might better hear;
“For what,” said he, “were women bred
But for man’s help and cheer!”
But all night long the woman watched,
Afraid at every sound;
And, as she sat, she sewed and patched,
And darned each rent she found—
And maybe wondered who had matched
The square peg with the round.
N.S.W.

Firelight.
If you have not sat by the firelight
In a home with rugged walls
Coated with whitewash, ages old,
Rolling and billowing, fold on fold,
You have not known
What it is to own
A little old corner in Fairyland,
A nook in the elfin halls,
Where sprite and fay
In the shadows play,
As the firelight flickers and falls.
The north wind moans in the woodland
And an owl in the old tower cries,
But the ruddy gleams of the embers glow,
lake the sunset over a field of snow,
And I reign alone
In a wonder zone,
Tiny, but boundless as Wonderland;
And the last spark flares and dies
As the moonbeams leap
Over plain and steep
Where the billowing snow veil lies.
Now the dim forms steal through the gloom-
liglit,
Over shadowy vale and deep—
Wayfarer, traveller, hunter and herd,
Wandering lonely beast and bird.
Each one tells,
Through phantom spells,
Of the bourne of his journey through Shadow-
land, 7
Or the watch that he must keep
Till shape and shade,
As the embers fade,
Melt into the mists of sleep.

Counsel.
Find some freckled fern seed to sprinkle in
your shoes
And you may step invisible down the
peopled street,
Or curve about the apple houghs like swallows
if you choose,
Lifted by the elfin wings that tingle m your
feet.
Oh, you may cull a-many sweet with fern-
seed in your shoe!
But leave alone the rue —
Little boy, little girl,
Leave alone the rue!
Keep the downy dittany and storms will bring
you calm,
Fill a vervain pillow for a thought-grieved
head;
Cherish balm whene’er you can, there s none
too much of balm,
And never stop for rosemary, ’twill follow
where you tread.
Taste the scarlet love-apple, if youth will
drive you to.
But leave alone the rue-—
Fair lass, fine lad,
Leave alone the rue!
Mis tansy in your Easter cake and earn a
placid year,
For though you cross the Little Folk they
cannot then offend;
Give a spray and take a spray of ivy from
your dear,
But pay with coin for parsley, or its price
will be a friend.
Wear a four-leafed clover and the charm will
win you through;
But leave alone the rue—
Grave man, wise woman,
Leave alone the rue!
Lovelier than wealth is laughing potentilla's
gold,
Eyebright is beautiful and kind to eyes
that weep;
Rich herbs of healing the wild glens hold
With hemlock and foxglove for those sick
for sleep.
Surely there are flowers enough and strong
leaves, too.
Must you gather rue?
Poor things, poor things,
Leave alone the rue!
Come the aged, creeping, each with wreaths
for his own grave.
Dried roses, laurel leaves, wisps of dead
grass,
Young-eyed forget-me-nots that old tears lave.
Heartsease and love-lies-bleeding, bare
thorns, alas!
Choice of life's harvesting, that tells the tale
true:
And all carry rue,
Evergreen, bitter green,
All carry rue!
VICTORIA.

A FRIENDLY CALL.
A few hours after this issue of The Bul-
letin begins to blush upon the bookstalls,
nine highly-polished evidences of Uncle
Sam’s self-respect will be tramping into
Sydney Harbor, and about the same time
a larger number of exemplars of the same
virtue will be plodding into Melbourne. The
joint value in ordinary commercial terms of
all these concrete witnesses to Uncle’s psy-
chological condition is stated to be
£146,000,000, an! he has a lot more at home
or pottering about the seven seas. These
demonstrations of national self-confidence
require to be frequently washed and scrubbed,
painted and fed, and the annual bill for up-
keep and renewals runs into the neighbor-
hood of £60,000,000. The figure is
large, but our relation on the other side of
the Pacific doesn’t seem' to consider it a
high one. He has examples on his doorstep
of a nation, four times his own human ton-
nage, which has lost its self-respect, and
despite the most frantic efforts, has been for
a long time unable to recover it. The price
that nation has had to pay for the loss in
terms of cash is almost incalculable; and
the moral damage is considerable. It has had
t.o sit still and see smaller European nations
build cities exempt from local rates, taxes
and control inside its borders, lay down their
own railways across its territories, set up
in its capital their own courts of justice,
police its rivers, and dictate the size and
incidence of the tariff they are to pay on
the goods they sell to it. It has had to
take a licking from a sub-branch of its own
race an eighth of its size, and has had to
endure on three occasions within the last
30 years the drums and tramplings of
foreign nations engaged in settling au argu-
ment of their own. The only means the
nation that has lost its self-respect had of
demonstrating its objection to these proceed-
ings was by riots or diplomatic protests.
The diplomatic protests were ignored, and
the riots were summarily put down by foreign
troops, and the Government was charged
with the whole cost of the operations and a
good bit over.
* * * #
„ Still, even before this horrible example
Uncle Sam was a whale on self-respect. As
an independent unit he made such rapid
strides in the acquisition of the virtue that
within 20 years of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence his traders were recognised
throughout the world as having behind them
the backing of all the might of their country.
Any insult to the flag or outrage to an
American citizen was inquired into with a
promptness and decision that earned the re-
gard of every shambling Oriental potentate.
Uncle’s home territories are large, and
economists calculate that their capacity will
not be filled until 700 million throats are
singing about the Star-spangled Banner; as
the present population is only a little over
100 millions, there is as yet no lack of
elbow-room. Consequently Samuel in his
foreign policy has stuck stolidly to business
and has never claimed to harbor imperialist
ambitions. Although he finds himself saddled
with 600,000 square miles or so of colonial
empire, he has no genuine appetite for other
people’s territory. He could long ago have
occupied Mexico but refrained from adding
to his racial perplexities in that direction.
Several of his colonies he acquired by pur-
chase, and others fell into his hands as a
result of a war with Spain, a country that
had long lost all moral claim to her posses-
sions and would have lost them to other and
more inconvenient neighbors if Sam had not
forestalled them. For the same reason,
Uncle lias occupied various strategic points
around his shores and warned off in no un-
certain manner all European interlopers who
have hoped to make a Donnybrook of any
portion of the two Americas.
* * * *
Australia’s spontaneous welcome to the
biggest aggregation of ironmongery Uncle
Sam has ever sent across the seas is the tri-
bute of one self-governing nation to another.
It. is a recognition of the fact that the coun-
tries with the white ideal have much in
common, that they are destined to tread
similar paths towards much the same goal,
and, that the process does not involve the
risk of treading on each other’s toes. The
scientific prophets who proclaim that it is
America’s destiny to harbor 700 million
human beings at the same time place Aus-
tralia’s ouota at 70. millions. The latter
figure does not look important alongside the
bigger one, but. it will suffice to make a self-
respecting nation, self-respect not being a
monopoly of the large nations, as witness
Switzerland, Holland and other sturdy pyg-
mies. There are American influences that
this country does not love, but on the major
issues, which are the main factors in +he
history of a nation’s growth, the two white
Pacific nations are entirely in accord. Includ-
ing Maoriland in the category, they are the
only truly white nations bordering on the
monstrous lake which is destined to become
the commercial, cultural and military centre
of the world. There is no reason why they
should ever be enemies: there is every ’’eason
why they should be firm friends.
OUR FINANCIAL AMERICAN
COUSIN.
The Commonwealth has toddled another
yard on the downward path, having “over-
come its original reluctance to raise money
in the United States,” and thus have two
shops to borrow at instead of one. Whether
tin! struggle with the original reluctance was
severe or otherwise is unknown, but no
sounds of fierce midnight disturbance were
audible. The chief consideration, apparently,
was to make sure that the Old Man in
London didn’t object, for it would have been
miserable to lose the old and tried lender
for the sake of getting a new and experimen-
tal one. The Old Man didn’t object enough
to stop the operation. His position, as has
been clearly explained, is that times are
cold and hard and tight, that business is
bad and isn’t likely to improve till Britain
gets a Protectionist tariff of its own and is
able to demand concessions in return for con-
cessions, and that the income derived for
services rendered abroad in the way of sea
carriage, etc., is only an imitation of its old
self. In addition, the Old Man is now a
debtor himself. So he can’t continue lend-
ing ad libitum to States which want more
and more, and have ceased to pay interest
save with a fresh lOU. J. Bull naturally
had no desire that his debtor should finan-
cially perish, to J. Bull’s great loss, and so
is willing that he should stave off disaster
by borrowing at the rival shop. The money
that is wanted is chiefly for the States. When
State borrowings came to average some
£40,000,000 a year, half in Australia and
half abroad, the Commonwealth, with its
own war loans to renew, foresaw a crash
unless the rush to be first-at-any-price in
reaching the early door of the pawnshop
was regulated. Someone would be trodden
underfoot in the tumult, like the peer who
was squashed at the gate of Samaria. So
it got into the way of borrowing on behalf
of its impecunious sons, which meant putting
its name at the back of an increasingly large
proportion of the aggregate State p.n. Our
American cousin, who has no great opinion
of States, having a fine family of once in-
solvent children himself, insists that this
practice shall be continued. Possibly he sees
an advantage in dealing with the central
authority, which may be asked for trade con-
cessions on renewal day. In consequence of
all this the country’s public finance begins
to look almost as tangled as the accounts of
a land bank in 18D3, and the process of
degeneration goes on. The position seems
to be that a financial crisis has arrived, and is
being adroitly smothered and patched by lay-
ing the foundations of another crisis in the
future. The United States only recently
entered into the foreign-loan business, hav-
ing a preference for industrialism., One of
its earliest ventures was when it lent
Queensland 24 millions at 7 per cent, and
on rigid conditions.
*• * * *
It is a matter of speculation what would
have happened if the New York loan market
hadn’t been available at the moment when
the Old Man in London showed signs of
financial overwork. Probably a period of
leanness, economy and hard work would have
set in, and imported Communists who avow
with impunity their intention to drench Aus-
tralia in the blood of revolution would have
got busy turning the consequent dissatisfac-
tion to account. But it is doubtful if the
American cousin will ever prove a very satis-
factory creditor. He may go "out of the
foreign-loan business as suddenly as he went
into it, for it is only an experiment with him.
He is never likely to forget that the Aus-
tralia that came to him for aid was not the
free untrammelled youth who first applied
for a trifle of accommodation in London some
70 years ago, but an embarrassed and pre-
maturely-aged creature who has in a con-
siderable measure worn out his welcome.
Also he is likely to charge for not forgetting.
There are only two money mairkets in the
world where there is the ghost of a chance
to do business on the Australian scale, and
when a countrv borrows hard in both of them
it has no spare chances left. The Aus-
tralian is a careless and casual .optimist, who
is going the wmy of the generation of Irish
landlords who began to be sold up wholesale
under a special law in 1849, ancf he will pro-
bably be as much surprised s|pme day as
they were when they found that the
dance had a finish. The six States
have practically doubled their idebts in 11
years. They have increased their debts by
50 per cent, in five years. They are due, at
the present rate of progress, to owe, or go
broke for, a thousand million pounds, quite
apart from the Federal war liability 7, in 1934.
All the minerals dug out of the Common-
wealth in the year to June, 1924, just
amounted to half the value which the States
dug out of the moneylender’s pocket in the
same year, the minerals being 22$ millions
and the additions to the State debts 444-
millions. The wheat crop didn’t approach
the borrowing crop by millions. The policy
of the day is to borrow enough gold abroad
to cover the interest bill which has to be met
abroad, and to pay the old interest, and some
accounts for the surplus importations which
help to keep Australia’s factories dosed, out
of the new loan. The expenditure here of
a corresponding amount in paper money on
what are called “works” nominally turns the
interest loan into a public works loan, but
that doesn’t alter the fact that the country
is accumulating wonderful liabilities which
can only be met with gold (and Australia is
fast going out of the gold-production busi-
ness) or by producing a very large surplus of
exports over imports. At present there
is a very large shortage instead, and
the general tendency is to reduce hours
and output and increase the shortage.
The “works” in which loan money is in-
vested now 7 consist of anything that happens
along.. Lately about one-fifth has been snent.
on railways, but the habit is to build lines
where there are plenty of voters and plenty
of lines already. Therefore, far too many
of the new ones earn neither interest nor
running expenses. Consequently it would be
cheaper to invest the loan mqney in pyra-
mids. which incur no running expenses be-
cause no one yet saw a pyramid run. The
h°pny folk of the six States have spent some
75 borrowed millions on buying their own
land from themselves and selling it to them-
selves at an advance on long terms. This is
called “settlement.” and it hasn’t been very
satisfactory. The revolutionary section of
society, which seems to have quite a respect-
able chance of attaining power unless Federal
Governments become less futile, proposes, of
course, to repudiate State and Federal debts
in their entirety. Bonds will be “taken over”
along with other property.
*-* . * *
It is an interesting financial field ,on
which our American cousin has entered, and
if he stays in it he may have experiences.
AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION AND
INTELLIGENCE.
Dear Bulletin, —A feature of the Sydney
press of late has been the daily recrimina-
tion between the rather futile Ministerial
Potts and the rather mild Opposition
Slurk, each expressing his opinion of the
other, which isn’t high. Recently Potts said
to Slurk, or else Slurk said to Potts (it
doesn’t matter which), that his position was
untenable, because the people of N. S. Wales,
being probably the most intelligent in the
world, were not to be beguiled by the guff
of the deceiver. A remark of the sort, about
almost any part of Australia or about nil
Australia, may be come across almost any
day, almost anywhere. If the Australian
really has cultivated his intelligence to the
degree specified it is pleasant to be informed
of the fact. If, on the other hand, he hasn't
done so, it is as well to be informed of that
also, for being puffed up with baseless self-
satisfaction only tends to stagnation. One
test of a community’s intelligence is the
speed and energy with which it goes in pur-
suit of knowledge. Compulsory primary
schooling prevails now in practically every
white community which knows the English
language, and in many which don’t. A
reason for this is that compulsory primary
education is a doctrine, and that the State
which didn’t profess it would be an object of
scorn and a mark for the finger of derision.
When children complete the compulsory
period after more or less regular attendance,
they can hardly avoid knowing how to read
and write, or being so described on the
census paper, even if they haven’t Darned
much in the way of brains, or acquired any
particular intelligence or reasoning capacity,
or any desire to know more than the irre-
ducible minimum. Therefore, the standard
of literacy as shown by the census can easily
be high, unless the returns are adulterated
by the careless admission of hordes of low-
grade immigrants. But if too large a pro-
portion of the children stop short when they
have scrambled through the compulsory time,
and if too many of them take to dead-end
occupations for lack of chances to do better,
•and to the study of inferior literature tcsn-oi
ally tips and odds) and inferior politic? £
average intellectual standard may be noth
remarkable after all. It is a -good sign “f
there is a healthy demand for college »dn,.,
tion to follow the school course, for it hag
to be sought, often with considerable effo-*
instead ot being served out free and r -,k‘.o'
under penalty, like, trades-union membership
or the victuals of a forcibly-fed suffra-et
in the days when the Pankhursts, of 7 on
don, went window-breaking. Much contumely
has been heaped on college education l‘
reason of the legend of Oxford 2d Cam-
bridge, greatly exploited in fiction as places
expenditure, free,u.nited by the sons
-of dukes and of rich vulgarians who wan-
to scrape acquaintance with dukes This
-especially applies to Oxford, the home of lost
causes, classics and the Oxford bleat P, u
most universities are places of hard work
and no fashionable pretensions, and are quip
devoid of dukes, there being insufficient dV-- s
to go round.
Australia doesn’t shape well in the suiiniv
•of university education by comparison witi,
many British-speaking communities, which
in a self-governing country, means that it
•doesn t shape well in the demand either it
shapes badly for its population, and worn-
tor its size, home comparisons' are taken in
a random way from the “Statesman's Year
Boole, the population and the return of the
number of students being for the same venr
and the number of colleges in brackets:--

ihe two States of the Union are quoted
chiefly because their statistics are presented
in a handy form, but practically the whole
4S, including some which are too much
nigger to be pleasant, might be called in
evidence. Connecticut, for instance, has an
area of 4965 square miles, which is less than
one-fifth of Tasmania, and on census-dar
had a population of 1,380,631. Its four prin-
cipal universities have 6095 students, and
there are minor colleges here and there.
Even Nevada, the desent State of 77,407 in-
habitants, which lives largely on selling cheap
-divorce, has a university which is 39 years
old and lately boasted 855 students—more
than equal to the record of Queensland and
Westralia put together. Maoriland, with
four universities, one adjacent to each end
and two towards the middle, is an example
also. The higher education isn’t always of
the same quality, but it is an outstanding
fact that there is no white or nearly-white
country in the world, barring perhaps one
Polar stretch and one Soviet region, where
it is so easy for an ambitious boy or girl to
be a hopeless distance away from any and
every form of it as in Australia, and by
reason of the massing of population in cities,
and the consequent emptiness of other
regions, primary teaching may easily be out
-of reach likewise. If higher education is sup-
plied at one spot (the State capital) the
State has “saved its face,” and its duty has
been done. The outlying possible student
may be 200 miles away or 2000 miles—it is
all the same. Queensland has seven, and
N. S. Wales has .14 country towns which
are larger than the Transvaal university
centreof Potchefstroom, and no loud, audible
■demand for a local fount of knowledge is heard
among the lot. The last return in the Fed-
eral “Official Year Book” (1922) showed a
falling-off even in the small number of stu-
dents, the decline being almost entirely in
N. S. Wales. Incomparably the best showing of
students in proportion to population was
that of S. Australia, while Queensland’s was
far the worst.
Australia has had good fortune, inasmuch
as its educational standard hasn’t been much
adulterated by a multitudinous population,
cither aboriginal or immigrant, which is
closer than the average to our alleged monkey
fathers. It has made no particular use of its
good fortune. It would have done better if so
many of its people hadn’t discarded the search
for knowledge too early. With a greater leaven
of inhabitants who had voluntarily pursued
information to its lair the general intelli-
gence would be more lofty. A few years ago
Sydney possessed only four “great” dailies,
and the editors of at least three of them,
also presumably the staffs, fully believed that
James uook was the original and historical
finder of Australia. They so instructed their
public on anniversaries, in leading articles of
length and weight, and, equipped with a
wealth of mussed-up detail. Dating from
the first known white visitor the record of
their country went back some 300 years, and
apparently seven-twelfths of it was a sealed
hook to them. Their patient and numerous
subscribers showed no signs of dissent. The
Bulletin publishes letters frequently from
heated patriots, who denounce any allusion
to the fact that tropical Australia isn’t fill-
ing up in the way the national safety re-
quires as a slanderous invention, instead of
an effort at improvement. One of them
(“Muddo” by pen-name), who certainly had
a gift of eloquence, lately went so far as to
declare with fury that “the population of the
North is growing faster than that of any
other part of Australia.” Doubtless he be-
lieved it. Yet in the last two census periods
(20 years) the increases were:—
Tropical Australia (1,149,320 sq. miles).. 36,120
Rest of Australia (1,825,261 sq. miles) .. 1,625,813
Total 1,661,933
Persons like “Muddo” should be impossible
in an intelligent, or at least a fairly accu-
rate, community, but they are far from rare
in Australia.
But if this country is short in the higher
education it more than makes up in compul-
sory trades-unionists, trades-union secre-
taries, strikes, strike-makers, and imported
preachers of gory and unpleasant revolution,
with entrails and sundries. To judge by the
quality of some of its Governments it is
nearer to the bog of Communism than any
other Dominion of the Empire. That is to
say, it seems to have a very fair and increas-
ing supply of these uninformed folk who
believe in unlimited papei* money, the Red
Objective, the general confiscation of pro-
perty, and, above all, the creation of much
more wealth by doing much less work or no


work at all. It has had, and probably will
have again, Ministers who proposed to abol-
ish the teaching of history m schools lest
Young Australia should profit by the lessons
of the past. They lack something of being
the sort of rulers that a really well-informed
community should produce. Outstanding fea-
tures of Australian life are abnormally vast
cities, vast debts with poor assets to show
for them, vast blank spaces, the vast obedi-
ence of the working classes to political and
industrial bosses of a low type, and the vast
recriminations among the bosses about the
alleged frauds at the pre-selection ballot—
the pre-selection ballot being now almost the
chief business of life. The artisan class has
been so levelled down by rules about day
labor and uniform pav that it has practically
no scope for ambition left unless it takes to
politics, the only line which it can attempt
without risking disqualification for its 30b.
Even if the Australian is all he is cracked up
to be for highly-cultivated intelligence, an
effort at mental improvement never does any
harm.—Yours fraternally, Griffith Moses.

A Sink for Millions.
Last March, which is about as near as the
figures can be expected to go, the Common-
wealth had lent to the State Governments
*34,758,165 for the purpose of “settling sol-
diers on the land.” The other £36,000,000
or so of loan money which the States buried
in this great work they borrowed them-
selves. The Federal authority now proposes
to write off £5,000,000 as having been lost
and muddled away in a very short time.
This, it is said, will make the Common-
wealth’s loss over £10,000,000, so there have
been previous operations. The plan doesn’t
necessarily imply an intention to clean up
the loss out of revenue and make an end
of it. The familiar way of writing off is
to shift an item out of the list of allegedly
"permanent and reproductive” debts and put
it among the hopeless cases, but to go on
owing it, and paying interest on it, and
renewing it all the same. Quite probably
more will have to be written off in time. The
State Governments are writing off similar
big losses, and expect to do a great deal
more in that line. In fact, they have no
clear idea when they will finish doing it.
The settlers fall naturally into four cate-
gories. There are those who have succeeded,
and they seem to be a thin crop. There are
the failures who remain in evidence, and the
failures who have passed out of evidence.
The chief causes alleged for failure are in-
experience, poor land, not enough land (in
many places farms were doled out in spoons-
ful by city theorists who had been reading
about closer settlement), outrageous prices
(the financing was done by hardy borrowers
of the town variety who were accustomed
to spend loan millions on building railways
which afterwards lived on the taxpayer), and
remoteness from a market, which is inevit-
able in a land where only one real city is
allowed to each State. A fourth class is
that which hasn’t been long enough on the
soil to succeed definitely or to definitely fail,
but unless it receives liberal concessions a
pretty general collapse is anticipated. .The
unsettled “settlers” who have totally vanished
are subdivided into those who only lost the
money advanced by the State, and those who
also lost money of their own, having been
led, in their inexperience, to put their savings
into the Government’s bad bargains. One
loser of £lOOO was recently mentioned. This
kind of person is liable to shoot the next
political philanthropist on sight. No com-
plete census of the disappearances has been
taken, but it was stated the other day that
there were 742 settlers or families in the
first series of Westralian “groups.” and of
these 359 are there no longer. The Aus-
tralians vanished on a larger scale than the
immigrants. This is said to be because they
were better acquainted with the ways of
the Public Works Department, which pays a
very fair wage out of loans for a 44-hour
week. When the returned soldier first be-
came in evidence two principal lines of
policy presented themselves. One was to
concentrate on teaching trades, to promote
the building of factories, and to start making
a multitude of things for the local market,
thus saving, in most cases, 10,000 miles of
import freight. The right kind of tariff
would have assured the local market, 'which
is big and ravenous, and if an effort had been
made to break with mouldy tradition and
settle the new artisans in provincial towns
many of their sons would have gone on the
land in due course. The cost of settling, a
man in a factory is small, and the financial
damage if he disappears out of it is not
worth mentioning. The other alternative
was to go in solidly for dabbing men down
on the soil at vast expense (some unsuccess-
ful settlers cost, and lost, a small factory
apiece), there to grow herbage, often out ot
union hours and at less than union wages,
that it might be sent away thousands ot
miles, thus losing great sums in outward
export freight. The second idea appealed to
Freetraders and importers, who have no use
for Australian manufactures. It touched the
imaginations of people with land which they
could sell to that patient ass the Govern-
ment, and the hearts of land-jobbers
and intermediaries, and the souls of
boomsters of all sorts who saw fortune
in a big influx of loan money. It struck the
ready and responsive instincts of a nation
which huddles wonderfully in a few big cities,
and hates even to go out and build a cross-
Australian railway lest it should get too far
from home, but which talks settlement with
the best. And it woke up politicians of all
sorts, especially the worst sort. The building
up of factory industries would have been
work for experts —mostly Private Enterprise
experts. But any eloquent public man could
gain kudos by leaving people on the soil in
the hope that their failure wouldn’t be appa-
rent for a Parliament or two. Mrs. .Tfxlaby
made her place in fiction by land settlement
at Borrioboola-Gha, and General Soaudeb
exists solely b.y reason of the fact that he
settled Maetin Chttzzlewit and Mark
Tapley at Eden. If the returned-soldier
business hadn’t been to a very great extent
jobbery the Federal Government would have
spent part of the money it has lost in put-
ting a railway through its own province, after
which it could have given away accessible
farms. Somehow the plain and obvious thing
doesn’t
Fruits of an Alliance.
The lately-interred Anglo-Japanese alliance
had consequences undreamt of by one ot tne
contracting parties. It gave Japan a breath-
ing-space in which to become a great Jracinc
Power, and to acquire further sinews of war
and industry on the Asiatic mainland, de-
signed to remove the menace of the Kussian-
Bear from the India frontiers, it assisted
Nippon to bash the same Bear in Manchuria
and annex his mess of pottage. Cheered by
this success, the Japanese gained a
controlling interest in the great coal
deposits and iron industry of the Upper
Yang-tse, and began a struggle, not
yet completed, to do the same in Shan-
tung. Oil having become a necessary in-
gredient of an expanding nation s dietaiy,
the Japanese increased their hold on bagha-
lien, their recent retirement at the Bol-
sheviks’ request being made at the price ot
large oil concessions. Fresh elbow-room was
obligingly given by the League of Nations
when it confirmed the Japanese Government
in its occupation of the Marshall and other
Pacific islands. The position to-day should
give Father Bull occasion for reflections.
He has been put to the expense of taking
out a new insurance policy at Singapore, and
has been obliged to sit idly by and watch
his former proteges helping themselves to
his tediously-built trade with China. Fnat
trade, he querulously complained m Parlia-
ment the other day, is dwindling. I lie
carrying trade of the world, once almost a
monopoly of his offspring, is rapidly being
taken over by his erstwhile foster-child. A
chart of Japanese steamship lines is quite
an extraordinarily healthy-lookmg octopus,
considering that it is only 25 years old, and
that for 217 years previous to 1854 : the
Japanese Government had made it unlawful
for any Japanese to build a ship longer than
75 feet, and decapitated any Japanese who
tried to leave the country. To-day there is
no portion of the globe, except the Poles,
which isn’t served by Japanese shipping lines.
But perhaps the most striking commentary
on the late alliance came the other day
from the lips of Westralian Premier COLLIER,
who has just returned from the Empire s
hub He said that many highly-skilled Eng-
lish shipbuilding mechanics are migrating to
Japan, because the new Japanese naval build-
ing programme promises the employment they
cannot get in England.
. *
The R.A.N. and the BN.
Fkom “Forebridge” who has been in both:
“The Australian Fleet has nothing to learn from
the British Navy.” This bland assertion fell from
the lips of Federal Labor-leader Charlton in the
course of an attack on the policy of exchanging
men-o’-war with the Royal Navy. The worst of suen
clap-trap is that, although the R.A.N. and thinking
citizens know that it & clap-trap, the unthinking
lap it up like beer. Short of abolistiing it altogether,
no more damaging blow could be dealt to the
struggling Australian Navy than by discontinuing the
system of periodical exchange of ships with the R.N.
Yet Charlton’s remark suggests that the fatal altera-
tion will be made by his party when (or if) it re-
gains office. . , .
The R.A.N. has been retrenched to a point pleasin„
only to unfriendly foreigners and pacifists. All the
four cruisers on the active list are obsolete. At
the so-called “Fleet” exercises last year, the destroyer
“flotilla” consisted of two boats, and a leader-less
than one division ; whilst the light-cruiser ‘ squadron
consisted of one light-cruiser. The Platypus, a depot-
ship completed the Armada. Although several care-
fully-staged attacks on a. mythical battle-fleet (repre-
sented by the solitary 1.-e.) were conscientiously
carried out by the “flotilla,” it is doubtful if the
tactical value of the operations to officers and men
amounted to a row of pins. In a big fleet, a
flotilla of destroyers consists of a dozen or more
boats with a leader. In the daytime, their chief
duty is to screen the battle-fleet from submarine
attack, while at night they screen the big ships
from .enemy destroyer attacks. In action, night or
day, their main function is to deliver torpedo attacks
on the enemy's battle-line, and also to thwart any
counter-attack which enemy destroyers may make on
their own battleships. These duties require more
than courage or zeal, or even mere seamanlike
ability on the part of the personnel. Years of
preparation, years of training, years of strenuous
fleet-exercises with big fleets, where conditions are
made to assume a similarity as near as practicable
to the real thing, are necessary before the art of
destroyer warfare can be mastered. It is only in
such a school that destroyers can learn their job
thoroughly.
During the war the famous Harwich I orce in-
variably cruised at night without lights. Not
even a green shaded stern light was shown. Course
was often altered as much as 180 degrees without
signal, and large alterations of speed were also
frequently made without warning. The tactical
efficiency' of that force was superb, and the fact
that Tyrwiiitt could trust his squadron of 30 ships
to manoeuvre in such a manner enhanced its offensive
value tenfold. But it was only years of intensive
and arduous training in peace time that made such
a feat possible in war. In the R.A.N. such training
cannot be obtained. However zealous and keen the
personnel of the three or four destroyers may be,
they have not a sufliciently large number of other
boats with which to practise. But it is not only
their mere tactical efficiency that is impaired. The
destroyers of the R.A.N. —unless they are periodically
exchanged with destroyers of the R.N. are debarred
from ever becoming proficient in the most important
single phase of their duties. They cannot learn the
art of attacking battle-fleets. The best they can do
is to make dummy attacks—-like the one referred
to earlier in this article —on one or two light-
cruisers representing a battle-fleet.
In ’ order ,to decide what course should be steered
to reach quickly the most favorable position for
firing torpedoes, rapid and accurate calculations must
be made, usually in very trying circumstances.
These calculations —and therefore the success
of the whole attack—depend chiefly on the correct
estimation by those in the destroyers of the “incli-
nation” of the opposing battle-line, which inclina-
tion may- be roughly described as the angular
'‘difference between the battleships’ course and the
destroyers’ course. In modern fleet-exercises the correct
estimation of inclination (which is also one of the
essentials of good gunnery) is treated as of para-
mount importance. Constant practice in judging
inclination is systematically indulged in by officer? in
• every class of ship; but it may properly be claimed
that the ability to judge it correctly should be one
of the main qualifications of a destroyer officer. An
error of • a few degrees . in judging the inclination
may—and usually does —render the attack abortive.
The torpedoes will pass harmlessly ahead or astern
of the enemy’s line. In the R.A.N. this long line
of battleships has, perforce, to be represented by
a short line of light cruisers, or perhaps only one. At
a range of eight or ten miles —which is the range
at which a destroyer attack is usually initiated
one light cruiser has not the remotest resemblance to
a battle-line. Nor, for the matter of that, have two
or three light cruisers. They are just indistinguish-
able smudges on the dim horizon, and it is impossible
for the most hawk-eyed observer to judge whether
they are steering north, south, east or west. I have
seen torpedoes, fired at a range of five miles in
such an attack, pass three miles astern of their
targets. In effect, officers of the R.A.N., unless
they exchange into the R.N. for periodical
courses of training, can never learn to estimate
inclination correctly.
The light cruisers of the R.A.N. are in almost the
same case as the destroyers. Owing to their lack of
numbers they cannot practise in peace-time the
complicated manoeuvres and tactics which, in a large
and efficient fleet, would be expected of them in war.
Gunnery exercises must necessarily be of the simplest.
Squadron-firing is practically impossible, for it is
only on very rare occasions that even three light-
cruisers arc available for fleet exercises. Only single-
ship firing can be carried out; and unless the
authorities have either salved the one and only
battle-practice target which was wrecked last year
at Jervis Bay, or procured a new one, even that
modest form of gunnery practice is barred.
In a country unable to afford a large navy, and
yet willing and eager to provide a small one, the
doctrine that such a navy, if kept at home, cannot
become efficient, is bound to meet with much opposi-
tion. Yet if that small navy, in time of war, is
going to join hands with a big navy in the common
cause, its officers and men must have trained exten-
sively with the big navy in time of peace. At
present 11.M.A.5. Brisbane is with the British China
Squadron. That is good, but it would be even
better if she were with the Atlantic or Mediterranean
Fleets, for they are larger organisations and there
is more to be learnt with them.

The Patient Bruce.
After a fortnight’s weary debate on the
plain and simple bill for tin) deporta-
tion of foreign criminals, the House
of Hops, was still being allowed to talk, and
the job wasn’t near finished. One Opposi-
tionist ' after another. but especially
Moloney and Scullin, discoursed about the
“liberty of the subject” as if_ the measure
was directed against Australian-born sub-
jects instead of outsiders. Laborite
McDonald dragged in the hackneyed quota-
tion, “My country, right or wrong,” as an
argument that our country is always wrong
if it tries to send some cheeky insurrection-
ist back to Ms country, which is always right.
He muddled the phrase, of course, but then
it is generally muddled. It reads something
like: —
My country.
Right or wrong, my country.
But may she always be right.
Laborite Maloney (the one with the “a”
and the hair) said sadly that there was no
knowing how far the measure would reach,
though as it can’t possibly reach more than
14J per cent, of the white population the
little man was talking wildly, as usual. An-
other theoretical person (the Age report said
it was Mahony) wanted to deport Austra-
lian traders who had charged 100 per cent,
profit on goods, though considering the rents
in some parts of Sydney there are traders
in perishables who would have a poor time if
they charged less. He further desired to de-
port Australian banks which took 25 per
cent, interest, but as bank rates are pub-
lished daily, and run to about 7 per cent.,
this was mere boggy conversation. The
amazing patience of the Prime Minister amid
all this melodrama led some people to
imagine that be was willing that the Yankee
Fleet recess should be reached ahead of the
tariff question. And that happened in the
end, although the Immigration Bill was put
through at length, as also was a measure
empowering the Government to suspend the
coasting-trade clauses of the Navigation
Act. To judge by appearances the
problem before a. man of peace and com-
promise is how to give so little aid to Aus-
tralian industry as to prevent the “Coun-
try” party deserting the composite Ministry,
it having acquired a craze for foreign goods
which is almost as senseless as Labor’s craze
for foreign criminals, and yet how to give
enough to prevent the National party throw-
ing said Ministry into the scrap-heap. The
principal landlords of the Country party
would probably climb down if an uncompro-
mising Prime Minister took a stand, but
Bruce seldom does, except perhaps before
the glass when he is shaving.

Cakes and Ale.
“Give your judgment but never your rea-
sons.” 'Giles Siiaw, C.S.M., must have had
this bit of judicial wisdom in mind when
he delivered his finding in a Sydney liquor
case. It was a reserved decision and a still
more reserved utterance —“Dismissed.” The
case concerned two constables who, being in
a city hotel 20 minutes after the bars closed,
called for a meal. Supplied with food in
the dining-room, they called for liquor to
wash it down, and got it. As a result, the
publican got a summons. He was charged
before the C.S.M. with having sold liquor and
permitted it to be consumed on his premises
after 6 p.m. He said he was within the
law in doing so, as the constables were
inmates within the meaning of the law, and
inmates were entitled to a drink, or, for that
matter, as many as they could hold. The
N. S. Wales Liquor Act provides that no
licensee shall keep his premises open for the
sale of liquor, or permit the same to be
consumed on his premises, on ordinary week-
days except between the hours of 6 in the
morning and 6 at night, but this does not
apply to “the sale or consumption of liquor
to or by any lona fide lodger, servant or
inmate if the'liquor is not drunk at the public
bar of the licensee’s premises.” Webster
defines inmate as “a person who lodges or
dwells in the same house with another, one
who dwells with a family.” and derives
it from “inn and mate”—that is to
say, a mate in an inn. But no
special meaning was given by the Act
to the word, and it was left to the
lawyers to wangle one into it, which they
did. It was argued for the defence that the
two constables were in all good faith “in-
mates,” their primary object being to get a
meal, and that the liquor was merely inci-
dental, a sort of appanage to the cooked
meats. The word “inmate” meant any per-
son lawfully on the premises, and tlie con-
stables were there lawfully to obtain the
square meal that every iun must supply to
the traveller who has money in his purse.
The prosecution, with the dictionary in its
right hand, contended that an inmate meant
only “one who dwelt at the hotel”; and that
is what the entire body of prohibitionists
will say. Giles Shaw, however, didn’t say
it. He said nothing beyond “Dismissed,”
but that simple word will be quite sufficient
to carry the case on to appeal. Ma Staters
who are troubled with thirst for strong
waters after 6 p.m. will look for tlie final re*
suit with interest. If the C.S.M.’s finding is
upheld there will be howls of anguish from
the advocates of compulsory drouth, for even
the eating of a bun in a hotel dining-room
after 6 p.m. may carry with it tlie solace ot
a beer.
Widows, Races, etc.
“S.M.”: A pension scheme for widows in
difficulties, which generally means widows
with no trade or profession, or who have
been too long away from it to resume success-
fully. and with children to care for, is on the
N.S.W. Government programme. Maori land
provides for, among others, widows and
victims of miners’ phthisis, though it never
had a Labor Government. The Baldwin
Ministry is pushing a widows’ pension plan
through in England, and the system exists
here and there besides. Old-age pensions
arrived in N.S.W. as a State business in
1901, under Dyne and See, and Carruthers
added invalid pensions. Then there was a
long silence. The Storey-Dooley Govern-
ment said it had on its programme a mother-
hood endowment device, but it never saw the
light, and not even a draft of it could lie
found among the Cabinet’s papers after
death. The galvanic McGirr was the man
in charge. Probably the Widows’ Pensions
Bill will eventuate, though the party is
better at providing billets for supporters than
at constructive work. There is talk of a
State lottery to furnish some of the funds,
and as tlie Golden Casket is almost the only
remunerative public undertaking that Queens-
land possesses, it is plain that there is money
in the business. A good deal of N.S.W. money
is in the Queensland business. State lot-
teries are not beautiful things, but some
points may be advanced in apology foi
one: —
It would probably take some money away from
the race business, and it might keep some people
away from the racecourse, they having bought
tickets instead of horse.
It couldn’t be so dishonest as the race business,
not even if the Treasurer occasionally bolted for parts
unknown with the entire bag.
It couldn’t by any possibility have so many
parasites, or such an unpleasant crowd of parasites,
to support as hang on to the horse and pony industry,
therefore more money would be left for the investors,
even after deducting the widow’s mite. It would
never be so extortionate as the bookmaker’s mite.
A lottery doesn’t lend itself extensively to em-
bezzlement, as few people purchase lottery tickets
by the pound. And it doesn’t encourage profanity,
wasted afternoons, free fights, expectoration, robbery
of the winner with violence, and drinking at booths
where barmen steal some of the money and
patrons steal most of the glasses. The dis-
appearance of 600 glasses has been reported in one
day.
Further, while it might demoralise a saintly com-
munity, it is doubtful whether one which has so
many pony meetings and so many accusations of
cronk practices at pre-selection ballots would suffer
much, or at all. It might even prove an uplift.
There exists a legend of a Dago community which
was so much belbw par that a distinct moral im-
provement set in with the introduction of bull-
fighting.
Of course, it isn’t certain that the lottery
game would bankrupt a pony course or two,
but having provided a new vent for the effer-
vescent spirits of the people some Govern-
ment might venture to close the worst of
them, if it is possible to discriminate. The
lottery has at least the advantage that it
doesn’t lend itself to the “tipping” business,
and when as much as 10s. 6d. is charged for
tips the point is worth considering.

The Barkly Tableland.
Some years ago the Queensland Parliament
authorised the construction of a rail-
way continuing from the present ter-
minus of the Great Northern line at
Dajarra to Camooweal, at the eastern
edge of tlie Barkly Tableland and within 10
miles of the boundary of Queensland and
the Northern Territory. The earthworks
were put down for about 20 miles beyond
Dajarra, and there tlie matter ended. Perhaps
the loan money gave out, or it may have been
decided that there were not enough votes in
the affair. At all events, the forgotten rail-
wav would promote permanent settlement
in North Australia, and its usefulness would
be multiplied if it ivere continued across the
Barkly Tableland iu a north-westerly direc-
tion as far as Newcastle Waters, filiat might
be done by virtue of an arrangement such
as is enabling Victoria to extend its rail-
ways into the Riverina. The tableland con-
tains from 40,000 to 50,000 square miles ot
country, nearly all of which is suitable tor
\voolgrowing, and would carry, on an aver-
age a sheep to four acres. After stocking
for a few years it might carry a sheep to
three acres. Sheep already run on the ie-
sumptions on Barkly Downs station, round
Camooweal, and tlie owners ot the unresume*
pottion, the Queensland National Pastoral
Co., are replacing cattle with sheep. Wool
from the Camooweal district is equal to the
best clips from Richmond and Julia Creek,
and these at Brisbane sales for some years
past have fetched the highest prices with
one exception, in the State. Jhe tablelan l
consists of open rolling downs well covered
with Mitchell and Flinders grasses, and has
a consistent rainfall averaging about o
inches annually. The elevation averages be-
tween 400 and 500 feet, and, although the) e
are no constantly-running watercourses,> su
artesian bores down to the levels of the ma-
under ground rivers at 200 to 000 feet wil
give good supplies. The cost of a bore, with
pump and troughing, runs to about £lot .
At present the area is given over to cattle
stations, running from 2000 to dOOO square
miles. Some years ago Avon Hovvns carried
45.000 sheep, but the expense of carriage
and the difficulty of getting labor mduced tee
owners to go back to cattle. From Brunette

to Dajarra loading costs from £4O to £5O
per ton in dry weather, and after rain it is
sometimes impossible for weeks to carry any-
thing to or from the railhead. In the larger
interests of Australia this huge area should
be converted from cattle to sheep country by
purchase of existing rights at a fair price
and subdivision into grazing farms, with
modern means of communication, including,
perhaps, spur lines similar to the 2ft. tram-
ways which have been of such service in the
Queensland sugar districts. A conservative
estimate is that there arc 30,000,000 acres
of good sheep country on the tableland
capable of carrying from 7,000,000 to
8,000,000 sheep, growing fleeces of the liigh-
est-grade merino wool. In a normal season
the clip would total 150,000 bales of a value
of between four and five millions sterling.
The climate of the tableland is equal to that
of Central Queensland or the Barwon-Darling
area of N. >S. Wales; the airplane service
extends to Oamooweal, and frequent trips
are made from there to distant parts of the
tableland: and the doctor from Cloncurry
can be landed at any of the tableland sta-
tions in six hours. A 60,000-acre block
would be enough to provide a good living
for a man and his family, and there arc no
rabbits or dingoes to speak of west of Camoo-
weal. Leasehold blocks of 50,000 acres and
upwards, suitable for sheep, are nearly im-
possible to obtain in any part of the Com-
monwealth, except remote districts of West-
ralia. Since 1890 the numbers of our sheep have
decreased by over 20 per cent. It is sound
policy to foster the woolgrowing industry-
even now the chief mainstay of Australian
wealth —by opening up such sheep country as
can be made available without any great
outlay or trouble. One of the few areas of
any extent left to us is the Barkly Table-
land in the neglected North.

Castles (and Slums) in Spain.
Dr. Bradfield, who is building Sydney’s
harbor bridge, having got the ear of the
Town-Planning Association which plans no
towns, discoursed to it the other day as it
loves to be talked to. In other words he
stroked the lunching cat the right way, and
it purred harmoniously, lie told it that
by 1950 the population of the County of
Cumberland will be 2,500,000, or about 1500
inhabitants per square mile, and will thus
lick every country of Europe into a cocked
hat for density. (He was slow compared
with a rival prophet, who said that Sydney
alone will have 2,900,000 citizens and citi-
zenesses by 1950.) North Sydney is to have
1,000,000 inhabitants a quarter-century
hence. The metropolis is to be rebuilt, sky-
scraper fashion, regardless of cost, to make
room, and to shut out the light. City rail-
ways and tramways are to be put under-
ground, regardless of expense, to make room,
and to create a burrowing population. There
are to be two or three or more harbor bridges
instead of one, whatever the bill comes to.
Presumably Bradfield is willing to build the
lot. It is impossible for a State of very small
population to wholly reconstruct a very great
city which requires so much done to it, but
as much as possible is to be done, at an
impossible price, if necessary, and even after
that many of the narrow thoroughfares are
to be almost impassable and uninhabitable by
reason of the rush of the dazzling throng.
These are not exactly the brilliant guest’s
words, for he spoke in the Town-Planning
language, but they are the coarse and simple
equivalent of what he said. The subterra-
nean railway and tramway scheme is of
especial interest, as all grandiose things are.
In 1916, before the “grouping” system dam-
aged the symmetry of the railway accounts
in the handy Whitaker, London had some
126 miles of subterranean communication.
The cost was set down at close on
£60,000,000, or £475,000 per mile, the total
being as much as N.S.W. had paid, up to
1914, for 3967 miles of line, though it has
paid a lot more since. The London lines
were built in ante-war days, with cheap and
comparatively long-hour labor, with cheap-
made materials, and by hard Private Enter-
prisers who had no need to mollify their
employees lest they should lose their votes.
They were worked on similar principles. In
the same year the dividends on ordinary
stock (seven varieties were mentioned) were
respectively nil, 11 p.c., 11 p.c., 1 p.c., 2| p.c.,
nil and 31 p.c. The private shareholders
had to stand the loss on their bad invest-
ment, and, save themselves, it was nobody’s
funeral. But if N.S.W. goes in for that kind
of financial dash, building on Government-
stroke principles, with loan money on
which 5 per cent. dividend has to
be paid even if nothing is earned, it
will be the community’s funeral, and it is
not much of a community to stagger under
such a load. The outstanding feature of all
such plannings and schemings is their pre-
posterous uselessness. N. S. Wales has
plenty of favorable sites for new cities, and
it has good but unused ports which could
be made accessible by a little cheap railway-
building. The price of one or two miles of
underground line would suffice in some cases.
There is something abnormal aboufe the type
of mind which avoids the great open spaces
and tries to shut up more and more of the
population of a baby State in streets and
lanes —one particular maze of streets and
lanes. And there is a kink in the mentality
which can grow enthusiastic over a scheme,
however remote and visionary, which would
involve pawning the thinly-peopled land for
centuries ahead iu order to buy holes for
the folk of the one great breathless centre
to burrow into, as if they were rabbits. The
vision is natural enough for the represen-
tative of a firm whose business it is to build
pyramids’ and imlaees and Babylons and
catacombs for ull and sundry, including
lunatics, provided there is a market for the
bonds with which the lunatics pay—it is
natural enough when he recognises an audi-
ence to which such guff will be acceptable.
But Australia hasn’t got beyond the pioneer-
ing stage, and its record is that of a very
neglected and dreadfully-embarrassed pioneer,
so it shouldn’t provide the audience. The
Town-Jamming Association is no sparkling
advertisement for this country.

Preference to Unionists—New Style.
The N. S. Wales Minister for Agriculture
did something easy when he ordered all the
employees of his department to join up with
unions under pain of the sack, without order-
ing the unions to take them in, or not to
throw them out, which would have been a
THE FAITHFUL HEART.
M RS. MICAWBER LANG (preparing to pawn the saucepan) : “Mr. Bull, I will never
desert you.”
much more serious matter. The position
seems to be that any departmental officer
whose billet is wanted for someone with a
“pull” may be disqualified out of the service
by expulsion from his union for alleged break-
age of a rule, such as absence from meetings
or non-purchase of the union paper, and a
vacancy thus created. Preference to union-
ists was originally established because the
unions promised to arbitrate instead of strik-
ing. Absolute monopoly of employment by
unionists is now demanded because union
bosses scoff at arbitration, and strikes are
incessant, . while the quality of work done
has deteriorated. The name remains the
same, but that means nothing. Of course,
there is always the chance of reaction. The
logical culmination of the present movement
is that everybody will belong by compulsion
to a union, and that the union tribunals
will mostly supersede the law, for when they
can, by expulsion or suspension, put any
citizen outside the money-earning class, the
law will be practically superfluous and will
only exist on sufferance.. When such a posi-
tion arises some sort of improvement becomes
due, though it is generally long of arrival.
The mills of God are said to be reliable but
slow. They are hardly ever in time to grind
the original offender, but sometimes they
overtake and damage his grandson.
The S’African Situation.
Robert Brothers writes:—
H. G. Wells has criticised what he calls “the
smiling, inept tours of the Prince of Wales.” I,
an Australian who has been in Africa for 18 years,
can testify that the latest of the tours at which
Wells carps has had a very good eflect in this land
of mixed races, especially as the Prince came at
the invitation of the Hertzog Government. South
Africa, to all intents and purposes, is a Republic, but
the view generally held In Australia that the Nation-
alists are all secessionists is not true. There are
secessionists, of course, and Hertzog (who is not
one of them) throws a sop to them occasionally by
promising that S’Africa will secede when everybody
wants to secede. Not a bare, a two-thirds or a three-
fifths majority, mind you, but everybody. This
seems to please the back veld and the wild young
Stellenbosch students, and it doesn’t offend the Bri-
tish. Travelling S’Africa, as I do, from top to bot-
tom and light across, and meeting all shades of
Dutch people, I long since decided that there was no
danger of secession. Generally speaking, the Dutch
realise that it would be a calamity to the country.
Australians who knew S’Africa during the Boer
War have no idea of the change that has come over
the country. In those days you could pick out the
Dutch from the English by both dress and' speech.
Now you can only know when you hear the name,
as Smith and Van Zyl speak the same tongue and
look exactly alike. Very proud are the young Dutch
people of their correct English. The change is
largely due to English literature. Dutch literature
has had very little influence, I think; but go into
any Dutch hom e and you will find the works of
English authors filling the bookshelves, with, maybe,
a few works by Afrikanders. It naturally follows
that the young people imbibe British ideas and Brit-
ish sympathies. Held up one night through floods
at a Boer farm and hospitably treated, I asked a
friend how I could best return the hospitality. “Oh,
send them a couple of good English novels,” he said!
Smuts is biding his time, and will perhaps attempt
to split up the Nationalist-Labor pact by springing
some proposal which the Laborites must support,
but before he can regain his old supremacy a great
deal of feeling will have to be overcome. Hertzog
was not placed in power by the Dutch vote alone.
He had a large following of English supporters,
business men whose takings had suffered from re-
trenchment. Statesman as Smuts has shown him-
self in international affairs, he was too patently kind
to big interests, and showed little sympathy with
the working-class people, to whom the kindly Hert-
zog makes a distinct appeal. Hertzog is doing as
much as he can to get rid of unemployment. But
one of his measures, the putting of 7000 white men
on the railways, meant the displacing of as many
or more Kaffirs and colored men, and it looked as
if there might be a black rising, the tone of the
blacks was so threatening. In my own case I
noticed less servility among the native workers, who
seemed sullen and cheeky, no doubt expecting their
own turn to come soon. Edward Albert Christian
George Andrew Patrick. David's advent greatly
improved the situation. The Dutch are vieing with
the British to give him a good time, and the blacks
seem to have forgotten their resentment against the
whites, and to have returned to their old belief
that British justice is as careful of the rights of the
black man as of the white.
o
Looking like an angry scorpion with its tail
uplifted, the Italian-built, French-engined
seaplane which has made a wonderful Might
from Rome to Australia appeared out of
heavy cloud-banks from the direction of Mel-
bourne, and, after tracing an elegant halo
over the mastheads of the Australian Fleet,
flopped on the waters of Farm Cove, Syd-
ney. Then it taxied up to a decorated stand
where Wing-Commander De Pinedo and his
mechanic, Campanelli, received the benedic-
tions of authority. A startled crowd fancied
at one stage of the graceful evolution that
the distinguished Neapolitan had mistaken
the green sward of the Botanic Gardens for
his appropriate element, so low did he swoop
above the bushes. It was an interesting ex-
hibition of the mobility of his machine, which
looked as if it could alight in a cup of cocoa
without spilling a drop. The exploit of Dr
Pinedo is an instructive lesson in the value
of amphibians for the defence of a country
whose only frontiers are the sea. Australia
has inventive geniuses capable ’of devising
machines equal to the visiting specimen. The
inventor of the seaplane which, a few days
before, temporarily showed an aptitude for
submarining in Botany Bay, and who hopes
for better luck at the second test, lias him-
self made mechanical fowls of the dry land
variety with notable success. It only needs
the stimulus of public interest and a Govern-
mental sense of the importance of the issues
to set the enthusiasts working.

“Bill Ding” : Trades unions, for the most
part, have dropped the argument that as
much can be produced in 44 hours as in 48:
Bill Bowyangs’ need of more leisure
for “intellectual improvement” is advanced
to justify the new departure, whatever the
cost. But the cost is heavier than most
people think. A big Australian sawmilling
firm has spent a heap of time finding the
exact production for several years, 44 hours
and 48, and the results of the innovation
have been worse than was anticipated. In
itself the loss of four hours per week has
been less serious (though serious enough)
than the spread of other losses on 44 hours
instead of 48 —the starting-up, the changing
of saws several times per day, the little
breakages and delays which no management
can prevent, and the slack feeling, the what-
the-blazes-does-it-matter mood that descends
upon men when the span of work is short-
ened without a complementary shortening of
the pay-packet. All these factors contribute
to diminishing production, with increase of
overhead expenses. Lots of workers think
the loss is only a matter of four hours per
week, a mere 8$ per cent. Actually, when
everything is allowed for, it mounts up to
15 per cent., in the sawmilling business, at
any rate.
*
Rev. Kirby, of Sydney, who is head of a
Bush Church Aid movement, recently re-
turned from wandering*? in certain dry and
unpromising parts of S. Australia, between
Spencer's Gulf and the Westralian border,
with this report:—-
I passed through immense areas of mal3.ee scrub
which are now being rapidly opened up, not on!v
for pastoral purposes but also for wheat-growing on
a fairly extensive scale. It was interesting to note
the provision being made by the Government of S A
to ensure a water supply. The nature of the soil
is such that the ground does not hold water conse-
quently dams and underground tanks have’ to be
lined with concrete and covered with iron sheets
to prevent percolation and evaporation. Right through
this country a chain of underground tanks is being
constructed. These tanks hold up to 500,000 gallons
each. The Government has completed the first sta<m
of a pipe line along the coast from the Todd Rive”,
near Port Lincoln, towards Ceduna. When com-
pleted, this pipe line will be approximately 300 miles
in length, assuring a permanent water supply for
stock in an immense area of pastoral country, the
settlement of which, in consequence, is proceeding
at a rapid . rate. Settlement had previously been
retarded owing to the entire absence of rivers and
creeks.
It looks like a valiant effort to do something
with an unpromising corner of Australia, and
better than the N. Territory device of
appointing commissioners. Perhaps it would
be best to put the S.A. people in charge of
the Territory again, with some millions to
spend on development, and let them build
the transcontinental railway and dam the
Finke River. The partial failure of pre-
Federation days came about because little
Adelaide hadn’t enough millions.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The present N.S.W. Government wastes
neither time nor frill. One of its hurried
deeds of sack was the dismissal, at a moment s
notice, of Mrs. Dillon, wife of a crippled
soldier, who had been one of the offaei.J
visitors to mental hospitals for nine years.
Nothing was alleged against her, and as she
lasted through the Storey-Dooley Administra-
tion there was probably nothing to allege.
Still a Labor supporter was waiting for the
billet, and though the dismissa lacked some-
thing of the courtesy with which a gentle-
man treats a lady, it was possibly considered
that a soldier’s wife is outside the pale.
A proposal was mooted the other day that
the five Labor-ruled States should meet the
strike trouble from a new angle by starting
a submissive coastal service of their own.
On hearing of which T. Walsh snid, Good,
good ! That’s the thing for us. Meaning
doubtless himself and Johanson. .
An early general election is expected in
Queensland. The Opposition, whose tom-
fooleries have assisted the Labor crowd to
hold office for an inglorious decade, although
the Federal Labor party has been routed in
Queensland at three elections, lias had its
annual split and change of labels. There
are now a “United party” of four members
and a “Country Progressive party of £>,
each “party” having formally expelled the
other. The Uniteds used to call themselves
Nationalists and Liberals, and there are
former Uniteds, Nats.. Libs, and Cockles in
the other lot, in addition to a gentleman
who has been Labor, Cocky, United r ol'd
Country Progressive all in three years. The
indications are that Gillies will scamper
through the session and rush to the country
in October. He will be a fool if he doesn t.
One reason among many for the soldier-
settlement frost was the tendency to cut
the areas too small, in the dread lest the
soldier should develop into a baron or some-
thing. The same niggling policy pervades
Minister Pearce’s scheme for selling free-
holds in the Northern Territory. An indi-
vidual may acquire not more than 1-80 acres
of good land, as good land goes in the Aus-
tralian interior, or 2500 acres of interior
land, at not less than 2s. 6d. per acre. I hat
sort of space isn’t going to attract sheep-
and cattle-men, and until railways are built
nobody is likely to go kitchen-gardening
much. Then the Minister for Small Things
lias his eye on Large Areas of not more than
20,000 acres, which, he thinks, are eminently
suited for development by companies, and
these may acquire the fee-simple on “certain
set conditions.” The idea of a whole man-
ager, board of directors and incorporated
body of shareholders grazing on a mere
20,000 acres of virgin, wilderness is pure
unadulterated Pearce.
THE TON OF THEORY.
“’Ow long ’ave yer been outer work, mate?”
“Ever since our- mob started job-control!”
The Speck’s new Parliament will meet on
Jnlv 28. The first job, after the formalities,
will be the election, by both Houses sitting
together, of a successor to Senator Foster,
resigned. Labor will probably nominate
McDonald, formerly M.L.C., but it is un-
likely that he will get more than 16 votes
of the total of 48. There may be a dozen
Nat. aspirants, among them ex-Senators Mu -
cahv, Keating and Earle, but the result will
depend largely upon whether the Labor
party’s number twos will be cast solidly in
one direction. If they are, C. W Grant,
of the Cascade Brewery, should about win.
A bit of history:—
The death of Senator E. J. Russell reduces the
number of Labor conscriptionists still in Federal
politics to five— Hughes, Bamford, Pearce, Lynch and
Newland. At one period of the war, Russell, who
drove a dray before he became a politician, was as
hostile to Hughes as any Laborite in the land, but
on the night when the affairs of the Parliamentary
Labor party came to a crisis, and Billy called
upon his supporters to follow him from the caucus
room, Russell joined in the procession. A wild and
woolly night that was. Tudor was immediately
elected Labor leader, and the usual placard, wit
the legend “Leader of Australian Labor Party, was
hung on the door of the room allotted him. One o
the seceders then placed in block letters above
the inscription the words “Pro-German, When
the trick was discovered detectives were sent for,
and three sleuths were deputed to ferret out the
offender. Their suspicions fell on a blameless member
of the staff, but on breathing them to Charlie
McDonald, the Speaker, they were politely told that
if they could do no better than that they were only
wasting their time and his. Nothing happened to
the culprit, whose identity was no secret, except
to the Sherlocks.
The navigation problem is a difficult one
for any Government to deal with, and no
one ever suspected the Bruce-Page combine
of that love of difficulties which makes some
men start for the Pole, and others go to
Darkest Africa to lightly tackle the rhino-
ceros in his den. The Government has cer-
tainly passed a new Act, providing that,
when coastal services are on strike, certain
clauses of the old Act may be suspended,
and outside ships be admitted to take up
the running. But no regular line is likely
to buy into a long-distance quarrel for the
sake of some brief casual employment, am
the services of a few tramp ships which
chanced to be at a loose end would amount
to little. The permanent difficulty is that,
under the navigation law, there has ceased
to be any navigation along a great stretch
of coast, save for a very occasional highly
subsidised ark of some minor sort. A searca
should be made for the leak.
It is in order to remind ex-Speaker Levy
that N.S.W. people expect something ot
him. He raised the startling issue that the
filling of Assembly vacancies by nomination
has been illegal since February, 1922, and
adduced what looked like good evidence. The
practice continues, and if there is the price
of a High Court argument in the Opposition
treasury he is called upon to win fame and
fortune by proving his case.
By 29 votes to 27 Vic. Leg. Assembly
threw out Laborite Webber’s motion declar-
ing for the abolition of the office of State
Governor. Webber’s idea was that all the
rubber-stamp work necessary could be done
by the Lieut.-Governor in his spare time.
Only that Farthing (Lib.), who favored the
motion, was obliging enough to pair with
Greenwood, who was somewhere in the city,
it would have been 28 all, and Speaker
Bowser would have had to use his casting
vote. Dick Toutcher (Lib.) was the only
Ministerialist who voted with the 26 Labor-
ites present. For years Dick has been up
against the Governor-importing system.
Eight absentees paired, and the full House
was thus accounted for. The result was a
triumph rather for Government Whip Groves
than for the Ministry that feebly defended
the present system. If Labor had been lest>
eager for limelight, and had allowed or im-
portuned a Ministerialist to submit the
motion, the Ayes would have had it.
A book was once written about a pirate
who had the misfortune to be frozen hard.
Being thawed about a century later, he
proved as young and wicked as ever. He
remained so till one afternoon the shock
of a slight fall set the wheels of time revolv-
ing, and ho died of immense old age the same
night. The remarkable series of accidents
(including one which cost a number of lives)
on the Queensland Labor Government s rail-
ways since engineer Buchanan aroused the
departmental bile by remarking on Ins ex-
periences suggests another case of a spell
breaking. The bottoms have dropped out ot.
trucks, engines have struck work, and at one
spot half a mile of line was found to have
become 2in. too wide, so trains apparently
ran that stretch on their luck. A parallel
which doesn’t quite fit is that of the Une-
Hoss Shay, which, because it was built ot
equal strength throughout, ran without am-
dent for a generation or two, and then, its
time being come, dissolved into dust on an
instant and blew away.
The most impressive speeches from the
Ministerial side of the House of Reps, during
the stormy debates on the Immigration Bill
were made by Latham, the Kooyong (Vic.)
Liberal, who has turned Nationalist, and
Maxwell, the sightless member for Fawkner
(Vic.). The least effective was contributed
by Mann, the self-advertising Freetrader from
Perth. Mann is fairly skilful at juggling
with words, but his denunciation of strike-
leaders stirred the Opposition to anger, for
which, in this case, there was some justifica-
tion. “Didn’t you lead a strike of civil ser-
vants in Perth yourself?” demanded a Labour-
ite. “It was the strikers who put you in
Parliament,” shouted another. The taunts
were well founded. While a Westralian
civil servant, Mann took a prominent part
in an agitation against the Nationalist Gov-
eminent, which was followed by his being
retrenched. When subsequently lie stood
for the Perth seat as a “Nationalist” the
civil servants, though mostly Labor support-
ers, rallied to Mann, while J. M. Fowler’s
friends, taking another win for granted, were
caught napping. The ex-civil servant will
get no Labor votes next time.
Lloyd Weathercock George, Britain’s ex-
Prime Mystery, has staged himself in a new
piece. At latest he was weeping lest the
Empire should “march through the ages
bearing the brand of Cain upon its brow.
This isn’t because the Empire has been kill-
ing anybody in particular of late, but be-
cause some Allied troops are occupying, m
an orderly way, the Hun city of Cologne, on
the Rhine, not far from the Belgian border.
It is held chiefiv that said Allies may keep
an eye on the German military arrangements,
which are regarded as large and suspicious.
The occupation of places for one reason or
another is too common an incident to call
for excitement. But Lloyd George, like a
hysterical woman, has to do “a good cry
now and then.
“lan C.”: Some of the Parliamentary
members of Vic. Farmers’ Union live in
Suburbia, and the organisation is wondering
whether it is sufficiently keeping up appear-
ances by tolerating this sort of thing. One per-
sistent Cocky candidate is reported to have
“qualified” by buying a bit of wheat and put-
ting it in the voluntary pool. And there is a
seat-holder who carries on a microscopic
farm by proxy —he employs a married couple.
The late George Graham, when member for
a north-eastern constituency, had a lotty
scorn for the class he dubbed ‘Colhns-street
cockies.” If he had lived he would have been
eloquent on farmless members of the Farm-
ers’ party.
Touching a conference: —
The drearily familiar spectacle of the White Aus-
tralian shipping industry, which pays the highest
wages in the world, being brought to a standstill
while Asiatic cheap-labor ships were loaded and
unloaded by White Australian wharf-laborers, has
been witnessed once more. However, while vessel
after vessel was being tied up the Walsh-Johanson
gang, through E. J. Holloway and E. A. Painter
of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, “requested”
a conference with the shipowners, the request being
supported by the other marine-transport unions.
The conference was duly arranged, and optimists
predict that it will result in a settlement on the
basis of the abandonment of job-control (it has been
abandoned several times already), while pessimists
foreshadow the usual additions to fares and freight
rates. Influences which helped to bring the parties
together were, on the one side, the threatened sus-
pension of the coasting-trade section of the Navigation
Act; and, on the other, the refusal of the other
unions to finance the seamen, the passing of the
Immigration Bill with the deportation clauses in-
tact, Labor Senator Ogden’s sturdy stand againrt
Walsh-Johanson tactics, and the deportation of Lyons,
who tried to introduce the said tactics into Maori-
land. The M.L. Government treated Lyons as a
public nuisance, and had the satisfaction of seeing
him leave the country with his tail down. Australia
treats the Walshes, Johansons and Gardens as eminent
public characters and has paid dearly for its folly.
THE PERFECT POLL.

In a bill it, was embodied; in a trice it was the law,
For its obvious perfections ev’n the Opposition saw.
So in blissful expectation they got names upon the
rolls .
And all parties started singing when they thought
about the polls.
Though by higher mathematics the results must be
worked out,
Not a candidate was troubled by the very slightest
doubt.
The election-day went over. All the State at concert-

Helped to keep the heavy polling from the very

But the figures spread by wireless in the middle of
the night -
Shed on all the situation but a very little light.

Then the Opposition fainted and the Government
went flat; . .
And each man of the Progressives rose and jumped

can’t prove to he untrue.”
SHE: “No fear, they don’t! This one told
me I would marry a man who was not
worthy of me.”
“Harold Hardupp”: Inadequate parental
control is giving police magistrates materia!
for homilies in Melbourne. In one case a
whole series of robberies was traced to a
gang of boy thieves, who had stored their
loot in a dugout hidden beneath a kennel
in the yard of the house where one of them
lived. In another three boys and a girl, all
about the age of 12, smashed windows whole-
sale to keep themselves supplied with cigar-
ettes, lollies and picture-show money. In
this case the parents admitted that their
progeny were entirely out of hand, but it
is something worse than lack of control that
is the trouble with some progenitors. In a
children’s court case, where the father of a
young outlaw had promised to try to keep
the youngster in better order, the magistrate
severely warned Dad against his apparent
tendency to regard his juvenile’s misdeeds
as mere youthful exuberance. “But, in
view of your promise,” he concluded, 1
think a caution will about cover the case.
Pride beamed in the fatuous father s eye.
“Yes, he is a caution, ain’t ’e, y’ Worship:'
he said.

“Oxmead”: In the earlier days of the
Westralian goldfields, until the railways
gradually circumscribed, their activities, the
camels and their Asiatic drivers were an
almost essential part of the community, lue
turbaned cameliers, Afghans or Beloocuis,
generally had their camps and depots within
easy distance of the principal settlements,
and although there wasn’t much interchange
of social amenities the whites viewed them,
on the whole, tolerantly. Liquor was pro-
bably forbidden the Mahomets and the Khans
by their religion; their nearest approach to
apparent enjoyment took the form of mild
and periodical corybantics held around a
blazing camp-fire on winter nights, .towns-
men and tent-dwelling miners were greeted
courteously if they cared to look in at these
jamborees; I have even known an invitation
to be extended to the local press to come
and witness the celebrations at what was pre-
sumably some feast or fast-ending day ot
more than ordinary importance, ihe paper
in its next morning’s issue gave the enter-
tainment a friendly word, a young reporter
venturing on the flippant assertion that the
dancers had “sprung off their tails with
immense empressement.” It was an unfor-
tunate phrase. Next day a score of swarthy
persons, looking as if they had stepped out
of that Biblical picture which represents
Joseph’s brethren as throwing him into the
pit, demanded audience with the editor. Ihcy
brought with them an interpreter who ex-
plained that the deputation were aggrieved
at what they regarded as a slur upon their
race —-Afghans had no tails. The correction
duly appeared in the next issue.

“X.N.0.”: Re the rounding up by the Syd-
ney police of suspicious characters, in anti-
cipation of the U.S. Fleet’s arrival (I>.
16/7/’25). I was in New York when the
Prince of Wales paid it his first visit m
1919. The leaders of the anti-British were
the persons from whom trouble was appre-
hended, and drastic steps were taken to pre-
vent it. The N.Y. police sent for each sus-
pect separately. Each one was told that if
any of the crowd actually made. himsell
objectionable he was going to Sin Sing any-
way and would find it hard to get out again,
whether proof of complicity was available or
not. Those who wouldn’t definitely promise
to abstain from agitation were jugged on the
spot. The others said they’d be good—and
they were.

“Simon”: “Norn’s” par. (B. 16/7/’25) on
the Engine-street (Sydney) brothers who
made their fortune running a two-up school
reminds me that on the walls of the estab-
lishment was painted “All fines paid in the
event of a raid.” But so well did the
“tylers” work that for years the police were
thwarted. A patron winning £lOO was given
15 minutes’ start before anyone was per-
mitted to leave the school. Then luck
changed, and three times in one year the
police broke through the cordon of guardian
angels and bagged all hands and the kip.
Then the management decided to go out of
business through excessive overhead expenses,
but they paid even the last fines, amounting
to £l4OO, to the uttermost bob. That’s 20
years ago.

“F.S.”: The occasion of the last excursion
of an Uncle Sam armada this way in 1908
was brightened up for Maorilanders by the
following advt. which appeared in the Auck-
land papers:—
DEPARTURE OF THE AMERICAN F T EET..
Members of the General Committee and their wives
or substitutes who are desirous of witnessing the
departure of the fleet are requested to assemble
at the Northern Steamship Company’s wharf, Quay-
street. on Saturday morning at 7.30 sharp to
accompany them as far as the North Head. All
members are requested to be present.
“Substitutes” was at any rate a gentlemanly
way of putting it. # #
“Giza”: Travelling to England about ten
years ago a woman in the second-class
gave birth to a son, her third child, and a
fellow-passenger started a collection. There
were wealthy people in the first saloon, and
the response was exceptionally generous. Just
after the ship left Colombo a concert was
held in the second-class, and the nest-egg
handed to the recent mother. She was
a diminutive, shy-looking woman, and re-
sponded to calls for a speech rather falter-
ingly; but what she said was frank and to
the point: “I thank you, one and all,” she
began, “for this very generous gift. It will
not only enable me to start a banking-
account for my baby, but also to see my hus-
band again. I haven’t seen him for three
years.”

“F N W.” * Nautical superstitions may die
hard, but die they do. With many years of

“ Don’t tell me you never kissed a girl before!”
“Hoio do you know?”
Shipping agents, possibly with a regard for
tradition, may continue to make the bnl-of-
lading read “Case of Natural History bpeci-
mens,’’ but it deceives nobody. I remember
the chief officer of one overseas ship that
carried such a case paying a surprise visit
to the ’tween decks which his men were
cleaning after the discharge, of cargo at an
intermediate port, and finding four of the
party peacefully utilising the boxed coffin as
a card-table. After the mate, had concluded
his harangue, one of the sailors spoke up
soothingly: “Well, anyhow, the old bloke
ain’t complained!’’ Following the Armistice
the Americans had several transports solely
engaged in the work of taking back their
d-n’d from Europe, to be re-interred in the
U.S.A., and there was no difficulty in man-
ning these melancholy vessels. I have been
through the sheds at Antwerp and inspected
a “full cargo” of nearly 4000 coffins —la’d
o»-* ?’-> resr” I '’!’ and each neatly covered
with a new Stars and Stripes—awaiting
the arrival of the U.S.S. Wheaton.
“Alwyn”: The recently celebrated anni-
versary of Captain Cook recalls that the
sons of the great circumnavigator had shock-
ing bad luck. When the Endeavor reached
England with the news of his George
111. or his advisers arranged that £25 a year
should be paid to each of the three sons.
One son, 16 years of age, perished in a foun-
dered ship; another, about 17, caught fever
and died; the third went to sea and was?
never heard of again. The King then con-
ferred a pension of £2OO a year on Mrs.
Cook, who lived to 93, surviving her husband
for 56 years.

visitors would take this effort of a Mel-
bourne paper: “In

that [ among other

reminds me of the
breaking of a long-

“Beetle-nut”: Mention of bagpipes (B.
2/7/’25) recalls the sensation in Papua
when a big MacSoraetliing, of ruddy
complexion, stepped off the schooner at
Port Moresby and played himself up
to the bar of Tom McCrann’s pub.
The first weird blast sent the waterfront
niggers scuttling for shelter, but curiosity
soon overcame their fears, and before the
piper had wiped the taste of his third
whisky off his lips a crowd of gaping fuzzy-
headed nigs., ready to run at the first sign
of danger from the new debil-d.ebil, had
gathered around the pub. A fortnight later,
when the hospitality of the port and the
supplv of Scotch showed signs of waning, the
piper boarded a recruiting schooner for
Woodlark Island. The fame and wonder of
the strange musician preceded him, and from
the landing to the Kulumadau township the

whole native population, in its walk-about
finery, lined the tramway to listen with awe
to the strange music and gaze with wonder
on the new species of mad dim-dim (white
man). Several days later the piper led a
vast procession of Murua nigs, on the six
miles’ tramp that separated Kulumadau and

THE FIRST FLEET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
>Tis midnight, and the lights grow less
Along the northern shore ;
The harbor sleeps, its loveliness
By darkness shrouded o’er.
Past point and point that sombrely
To port and starboard loom
A collier makes her way to sea,
Dark-bulking in the gloom.
So still is all, so hushed of sound,
So void of stir and strife,
The past seems breathing all around
As though renewed with life.
Though still the stars shine down, as when
They lit unsullied skies,
All changed seems all; and once again
Dead scenes, dead years arise.
’Tis midnight, yet no high-set clocks
Their solemn tones fling wide,
But only washing round the rocks
Lap-laps the making tide.
What ships are those in yonder bay
That swing to tide and wind,
With riding lights that slowly sway,
And boats a-trail behind?
As on the tide, bluff stern and stem
Rise gently, gently fall—-
Who strikes the midnight bell on them
What bos’n pipes his call?
Mute grow their bells, and Silence old
Once more the moment grips—
Who captains them? What sailor bold
Brought hither yonder ships?
What writing hand of Destiny
Gold-lettering time’s page,
Sent him o’er windy wastes of sea
To find yon anchorage?
From cloudless skies star-shine downcast
Gleams over rock and wave;
The dream-hour passes, and the Past
Goes shrouded to its grave.
A low wind, waking leaf and flower,
Across the harbor comes,
A city clock chimes out the hour—-
Far-off late traffic hums.
The dream-hour dies, its magic fled,
And, mist-like, from yon bay—
Dim phantoms of a night long dead—
The First Fleet fades away.

SCOTCH WHISKY
Beautifully Clean, Soft and Mellow.
“American River” : The late Simpson New-
land is the only Australian writer who has
made use of the abundant material for romance
offered by the old whaling days. Perhaps
the best of his “Paving the Way” is the part
of the story woven round the station of the
Van Diemen’s Land whalemen at Encounter
Ray, where they established themselves when
South Aus. had hardly begun to exist even
in the fertile brain of E. G. Wakefield. Be-
fore Major Lockyer founded in 1826 the first
tiny settlement within the limits of what
is now Westralia the sealers from Van
Diemen’s Land and Kangaroo Island worked
their way in schooners or in open whale-
boats along the whole southern coast of Aus-
tralia, and as far as Rottnest and the Swan
River. Not only at Encounter Bay but at
Fowler’s Bay (S.A.), at Twofold Bay
(N.S.W.), at Portland Bay and Port Fairy
(Vic.) the whalers were far ahead of settle-
MERELY AN OVERSIGHT.
“What sort of a reception did your wife
give you when you got home?’

"Good Lord! How did you get that black

meat. In the South island of Maoriland, too,
limy were busy at Cloudy Bay, Jacob’s River,
the Bluff, Stewart’s Island. Banks Peninsula
and many other parts from 1829 onward,
and the sealers had been there long before
them. For sheer daring, hardihood and en-
durance, for strange adventures by sea and
land, for wild doings in peace and war with
cannibals and primitive savages, the experi-
ences of the sealers and bay whalers of the
early days of Australasia are not easily
paralleled. What were the hardships and
shifts of Robinson Crusoe compared to those
of the four men who landed on a mere rock
off the southern end of Maoriland with an
iron pot and half a bushel of potatoes, and
spent seven years there?
LOOK both ways.
“That pretty little widoic, Mrs. James, gave me a box of cigars for my birthday .”
“Beware of widoics’ weeds, old man.”
“11. Hardupp”: I don’t think “Wallaby”
need worry over Celestial resentment at the
desecration of the South Melbourne joss-
house ; most Melbourne Chinese are Congre-
gationalists or Presbyterians these times, and
those who can afford it send their sons to
Scotch College. There is something in Scot-
tish creeds and cults that seems to appeal
particularly to the Australianised Chinese,
by the way. There is a movement now in
Melbourne to revive a volunteer Highland
regiment, and one of the first inquirers about
it was a wealthy Chinaman who said that he
was not only prepared to give a substantial
donation for equipment, but he had two stal-
wart sons who were eager to enlist. Their
mother is a half-caste whose mother was a
McParritch (or something) and McParritch
is proudly preserved in the names of both the
boys.
* * * *
“Lampada”: I wonder if “The Oldest In-
habitant” (B. 2/7/’25) ever heard of an
offer made somewhere in the 1830’s by the
then Government official responsible for
handing out land by the square mile to in-
tending settlers round about Sydney Cove?
One Wyndham—he came from England and
settled later at Dalwood, in the Maitland
district—was offered as much as he liked
to take of Sydney’s North Shore. He de-
clined, on the ground that he wanted to run
stock, and that the harbor shores made poor
grazing country. The story, whatever it may
rest upon, has been handed down through
four or five generations of the family; the
Wyndham of to-day still shakes his head
sorrowfully as he tells of his ancestor s re-
fusal of North Shore as a gift.
* * * *
“H.K.”: Touching those early S. Aus. sov-
ereigns (B. 16/7/’25), another form of gold
coinage issued from the Adelaide Assay Office
in 1852. It bore on the obverse a figure
of a kangaroo, and “1853, Port Phillip, Aus-
tralia ” and on the reverse “Two ounces” in
the centre with a foliated border. This coin
was probably never in circulation, being
apparently used as a “proof.”
* * * *
“Forebridge”: More than two years since
the old Burns-Philp steamer Mindini found
a last resting-place on Mellish Reef, one of
the most isolated coral atolls of the N.-W.
Pacific. At the inquiry into the loss of
the vessel grave doubt was cast by the ship’s
officers on the accuracy of the Admiralty
charts of the locality, and the plea—impos-
sible of disproof at the time—doubtless con-
tributed to their exoneration. The British
Admiralty, however, was not so easily con-
vinced, and in June, 1923, H.M.A.S. Bris-
bane. whilst on passage from Hervey Bay to
Tulagi, was ordered to fix the position of
the reef. This was done by the warship’s
navigating officer, and records of the astro-
nomical observations, together with all the
calculations involved, were duly dispatched
to the Hydrographic Department. In the
absence of any notification therefrom,
after a lapse of 18 months, it may
be assumed that the calculations have passed
the very searching scrutiny invariably given
to such work. At the inquiry it was sug-
gested that the reef was placed at least 15
miles wrong on the Admiralty charts. My
observations showed the error to be less than
1500yds. Which suggests another unsolved
riddle to be added to the long tale of sea-
mysteries .
* * * *
“X.N.0.”: It isn’t only members of the
underworld who need watching when the
Commonwealth is entertaining guests. When
the Renown was here in 1920 some of the
officei's were taken down by an exception-
ally clever knave who managed to get
an introduction to them by the presentation
of a card which described him as president
of some industrial enterprise. He was a
highly-educated man of really charming man-
ners, the most pleasant and entertaining of
companions; some of the officers went on
personally-conducted tours through the coun-
try with him, passes being cheerfully
provided by the N.S.W. Government.
Several invested money in a concern
in which the “president” was interested.
Unfortunately I was one of them; all I have
to show for the investment is an unsatisfied
judgment.
* * * *
“Caractacus”: Mysterious are the ways in
which the milk of human kindness flows.
Watch in the newspapers an appeal for a
family in distress, for a mem-
orial to a literary or artistic
giant, for a fund to beautify a
city, and see how slowly the shil-
lings and crowns dribble in. Yet
in Melbourne an
appeal to save
three tigers from a
cage in a circus,
and to transfer
them to a cage in
a zoo, whipped up
£3OO in a few days.
The irony of it is
that the Zoo has
enough tigers —it
has cubs thrust
upon it every year
by a prolific pair
of carnivora—and
was very pleased to
see £lOO and some
feline and other
“boot” for its last
tiger litter, the sub-
ject of the present
appeal for a re-
purchase. It sug-
gests a new indus-
try for Melbourne
money-bugs embar-
rassed to find in-
vestments for their
ever - accumulating
pi'ofits. Instead of
financing motor-
firms, theatres, land
companies, sky-
scrapers and the
like they could contract to take the Zoo’s
tiger output, threaten to run a menagerie-
circus, and so build a fine business on the
soft hearts of human beings who prefer a
live lion to a dead deadbeat.
* * * *
“Lai” (B. 9/7/’2o) is wrong in his dates
when he makes the name “Dubbo” a product
of the early ’seventies. In 1866 I was sur-
veying for the S.A. Government some 20
miles from the Burra, and had in my camp
an old Government horse which had come
from Dubbo (N.S.W.) and was named accord-
ingly. Steve King, a member of McDouall
Stuart’s transcontinental expedition, was my
chainman at the time, and could bear me out
if he is still living. Anyhow, Dubbo was
then well known as the name of the N. S.
Wales town.
“Yacko”: Though South Australia is
proud of having escaped the convict birth-
stain, some recent papers read before the
Geographical Society are a reminder that
her earliest history was a lurid one. Escaped
lags and absconded sailors made their homes
on Kangaroo Island, Thistle and St. Peter's
isles, and went along the coast far to the
westward. On one of these expeditions the
shipwrecked crew of an American whaler
were murdered, and because grog was apt
to loosen the tongue of one of the murderers,
and it was feared he might boast of the
crime, his mates secured his silence by cut-
ting the rope when they were hauling him up
the cliffs. Lubras were kidnapped by these
buccaneers from Port Lincoln, Encounter
Bay and Tasmania. Captain Sutherland, a
chronicler of doubtful veracity, says that in
1819 he came across a community of 40,
consisting of white men, native women and
half-caste children. To-day only the off-
spring of one man and his native “wife” can
be traced.
* * * *
“ILK.”: Apropos reluctant brides (B.
2/7/’25). At a very largely-attended
Bathurst (N.S.W.) wedding some years ago
the leading lady astounded those present by
replying to the parson's question, “Will you
take this man, etc.,” with a most uncompro-
mising. “I will not.” “Then what brought
you here?” inquired the astonished cele-
brant. “Just to tell him so,” sturdily an-
swered the fair one, turning on her heel and
leaving the church.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: A cable about the unveiling
of a memorial in the Dorrington Cemetery
to the 141 Australians who died in the Lark-
hill Camp during the war sets me wonder-
ing how many Diggers were invalided as a
result of exposure in that supremely unsuit-
able place. It was something approaching
a crime to dump men from Australia, least
inured to bleak conditions, in one of the
bleakest spots in England. The big casualty-
list occurred in the particularly severe and
prolonged winter of ’l6-17. In the latter
year snow fell even as late as May; and
Diggers familiar with the icy water of
French trenches said much worse things
about the Larkliill weather. Until the
casualties put the wind up the camp authori-
ties, formal parades required that men should
be kept standing still in a wind that cut
like a knife; it was when men commenced to
drop where they stood in the ranks, and one
was found to be dead before he reached hos-
pital, that the foolishness was stopped. To-
FORGETFUL FLOSS.

wards the. autumn of ’l7, A.I.F. representa-
tions having borne fruit at last, the Austra-
lians were suddenly turned out of the camp
and rushed down to Sutton Veny and there-
abouts. The Dorrington memorial remains
to testify to one of the many blunders of the
War Office.
* * * *
“X.N.0.”: The paragraph on the Santa
Barbara (Cal.) earthquake (B. 16/7/’25)
reminds me that the Americans dislike refer-
ences to the San Francisco earthquake of
April, 3906. In fact, because it might
damage California’s reputation, many refuse
to admit there was an earthquake at all.
They will talk ad lib. about the ’Frisco fire
of the same date, but by general agreement
the preceding calamity is ignored.

Who live our lives in Melbourne, where the Polar

The figures prior to 1919 are interesting but
of no particular value to the investor. For
a dreary run of years following the great
smashes of the early ’nineties the manage-
ment was faced with the problem of clean-
ing up a mess which at the time must have
looked almost hopeless. Most of the task
fell on \Y. V. Ralston, who completed it be-
fore he passed out on the eve of the bank’s
jubilee. However, those incidents belong to
the past, and 1919 marks the new starting-
post. In 1922 (the jubilee year) a bonus
of 21 p.c. was added to the div., and
was repeated in the next two terms. Follow-
ing the 1924 distribution, however, it was
officially announced that the div. rate
would in future be 10 p.c., and that
issues of new capital would be offered
to shareholders at par. That was decidedly
more satisfactory than the arrangement it
displaced: part of the distribution in bonus
form and share issues at unknown premiums.
In March last an issue was made under the
new conditions: 60,000 £5 shares, in the
proportion of one in four, payable 30s. on
application, the balance to be collected in
calls during the current year. But as calls
paid in advance after April 1 participated
in divs., most of the money was in by the
close of the accounts. In view of that definite
pronouncement it is fairly certain that the
div. rate is fixed for some time, but the
market holds the scrip in high esteem,
as much for the quality of the invest-
ment as for the possibilities of fui-ther par.
issues. The Q.N.’s reserves are substantial
enough in relation to paid capital without
the necessity of swelling them by large par-
cels of premiums, particularly as it has
£3.091669 of interminable inscribed deposit
stock—sole relic of the bad old days—which
bears the low interest rate of 3J p.c. The
Bank is in a strong position. During the
latter part of the recovery it got well in
advance of its plan for the- repayment of
old deposits, and the internal strength
was added to. In the circumstances the
payment of the 10 p.c. div., even on
the increased capital, offers no difficulty.
The accounts merely disclose the net profit
without indicating the various provisions,
apart from £12500 written off premises.
Whether the amount of profit claimed was
the true figure is hard to say; even the man-
agement cannot be sure. Bankers have to
provide against every known contingency,
and although wool, sugar, maize and wheat
have shown wonderful yields, and promise
to repeat the performance, the times are by
no means normal even yet. Bankers make it
their rule to play safe; generally very safe.
Judged on its past, the Q.N. did not forget
any provision when it wrote in its record
profit figure. And on interest-earning assets
(£200,000 of the bank premises item is re-
venue-producing) the £196,946 represented
only 1-J p.c.
Paid capital on June 30 was £1,453,551,
which will expand to £1,500,000 when the
last of the call money is in. At the con-
clusion of the clean-up it was £480,000. The
interminable inscribed deposit stock is cheap
fixed capital, the 31 p.c. interest which it
carries having been' a bargain rate in the
later years of dear money. Balance-sheet
figures disclose a very solid position ;

Every movement was an improvement.
Deposits increased by £190,921, and advances
expanded by £452,622, and the management
isn’t cramped so far as the latter is con-
cerned, a capital position to be in at the pre-
sent time. The liquid position is very strong,
almost half of the money for which deposi-
tors and other creditors could call bein o
handy. Among the investments are Alilia-
quin Sugar, a solid S p.c. proposition, and
Q.N. Pastoral, which has not paid divs. on
ords. since the 1920 slump. Including the
interminable stock with capital and tne
£675,950 of reserves remaining after nnai
appropriation on June 30, the banks own
funds amounted to £5,221,170. Liabilities
to the public totalled £8,322,410; hence the
Q.N. was holding less than £1 12s. tor
each £1 of its own funds. Of course such a
remarkably large proportion of funds to out-
side liabilities means exceptional security to
depositors. With the proportion of assets
liquid much greater than is usually considered
adequate, and the proportion, of money held
so small, the management is in a position to
increase its business materially.

In recent times there is nothing so good as
the figures for the past half-year. Back in
the summer of 1914, before the Croat l\ar
on Germany and Beer, a profit ot £4U, < 18
was disclosed —relatively better than last
half, for 11 years ago capital was £252,900
compared with the £854,190 w’liich was at
work last half-year. But those were the
days when gold-mining flourish/ed in the
West, and the idea of a bonus on production
was not dreamed of. Still, there were bad
days before the good days. In its early years
large parcels of Swan shares were held by
Vic. land-boomers, and when call-time came
the forfeitures were on a high scale. The
Coolgardie rush, however, filled the land with
a great thirst, and there came a long run
of big divs., mostly 24 p.c. with odd 32 p.c.
euln”'""fing in a bonus issue of
£101,450 in 1912.
Two years ago the Board decided to in-
crease capital in order to modernise some
hotel properties and manufacture lager and
bitter beer. Only a ss. premium was asked,
so that shareholders were on a 13J p.c. basis
on their new holdings. In any case, unless
the Drys win unexpected victories, the 16
p.c. on ordinaries seems assured; for seven
recent half-years the divs. were at the rate
of 20 p.c., and for the past twelvemonths
profits were well beyond 16 p.c. div. require-
ments. That, of course, is not surprising, in
view of the heavy visible accumulations which
helped capital—mean visible reserves _ last
year amounted to £315,781. In addition,
fixed assets have been written down hard;
plant and machinery are in at £267,314 less
£147,407 written off, rolling-stock £40.664
less £33 847 and hotel properties £364,776
less £52 500. Hotel property in Perth has
greatly appreciated of recent years, but that
does not stop and has not stopped the de-
preciation of the buildings themselves; and.
of course, there is always the possibility of
delicensing and the consequent disappearance
of much of the value even of the physical
assets.
The Swan is a Melbourne co. controlled by
men closely connected with Melbourne brew-
ing. Montague Cohen, of the Carlton and
United Breweries, is chairman. There have
been rumors of amalgamation, but these have
been given official denial. There certainly
seems no particular reason for it. The posi-
tion as at March 31 was very solid; mort-
gages amounted to £9046, trade debts were
£24 7,33 and “accounts in credit, including
goodwills accruing,” £52,090. More or less
liquid assets amounted to £186,000.

And having built that table the Wild Cat
views it with a certain amount of suspicion:
some of it may be putty and not sound
timber. The published accounts say the
profit for the past year was £14,165 “after
making provision for depreciation, insurance
....and boiler repairs accounts.” Into one
insurance account £5005 was dropped
during the term and £2121 into another, and
£3500 went into the boilers account ; and
the question is how much of all that is real
profit? It certainly doesn’t look all putty.
At any rate, last year’s profits, taking
them at £24,800, and after allowing an un-
known amount for depreciation, were equal
to very nearly 10 p.c. on the capital plus
all the insurance and other reserves. That
looks as though those reserves are to a great
extent genuine reserves, and the profits which
feed them genuine profits. Yet there has
never been much in it for shareholders. Re-
gistered in 1881, the co. suffered in the
smashes of the early ’nineties, ss. 6d. being
written off each £1 share. Present capital
(£101,412) is in 172,291 fully-paid shares of
14s. 6d. and 104,289 paid to 7s. —unaltered
since pre-war days. The 7 p.c. divs. with
which the table opens sti-etcli back to ’97.
Conditions are unquestionably better to-day ;
for, though costs have jumped, there is more
settlement in the districts served by the co.’s
little fleet, and the man on the land is nowa-
days comparatively affluent. What looks
like solid progress is further reflected in
these figures:—

The ship item has shrunk no doubt, through
depreciation; and, though it is apparently
earning more than ever it did, replacement
has to be provided for. Even so, it is clear
that the co. has been in a position during
the past few years to sock away a nice
dry bit.

Or you can knock out that “property reserve,
£l7 641,” and thus reduce the reserves to
£6229. and this Column won’t quarrel with
you. It comes about this way. The co
plunged during the year, bought freehold
and leasehold licensed properties and placed
them in the books at £BB 693. The proper-
ties are in “at valuation”; but £17.641 re-
presents. on “a very conservative estimate,”
the bonus value of the licenses attached to
the properties, and this amount has been
treated as a special reserve. Apparently the
idea is to write it down out of profits as
they are made, reducing the valuation of
the asset simultaneously. According to the
management same of the freeholds have
already been written down. Further: “This
special reserve was established for the pur-
pose of equalising the bonuses earned on the
sale of these freehold and licensed properties
and to prevent undue proportion of profit
from coming into the accounts of the co. in
one year, for the sale of such leases may have
a currency of several years.” The depend-
ence on outsiders was heavy owing to the
large amount tied up in stocks. And, apart
from the mortgages, the co. leaned more
heavily on its bankers, the overdraft increas-
ing from £7626 to £23 392. Trading debts
were somewhat heavier. and deposits
advanced from £8495 to £l4 571. Here is
a comparison of balance-sheet figures from
the time the public became interested: —
1920. 1922. 1923. 1924.

Cash, etc 253 561 1,450 1,394
The purchases belong to the latter part of
the year, and did not influence the accounts
to any considerable extent: gross profits
were £47,764 compared with £43,462 for
1923 What the return was on ordinaries
is difficult to estimate. The amount dis-
closed after providing for the prefs. and the
staff bonus was equal to 14.6 p.c., but that
figure must be reduced by whatever was
necessary to pay State and Federal taxes,
for they were to be met out of the undistri-
buted balance, which would probably leave
a narrow margin between profits and distri-
bution. There is not much in wine on that
showing, notwithstanding that the co. owns
or controls a number of saloons. A recent
campaign against the low-class saloons doubt-
less affected the trade generally, and the
growers, vignerons and merchants are sultei-
ing because of it. Australia grows very fine
wines • it has the climate which should make
it a wine-drinking country, but there is no
organised effort to make and keep the retail
trade irreproachable. The consequence is
that instead of expansion there is almost
continual conflict with the anti-salooners
who, to scotch a small evil, are prepared to
kill a national industry. The market does
not fancy the scrip. Sales were made prior
to the div. at 17s. Gd. and 18s., which was
o s better than the previous year. Capital
of £95,500 was represented by net assets
with a book value of £119,370. This was
equal to £6 2s. 7d. for each pref. share or
255. for each £1 of capital. But that valua-
tion has to be considered along with the
remarks previously made about the proper-
ties.

The Victorian belongings have been sold to
Freehold Assets, Ltd., a Melbourne co. Botli
cos. are in business as financial undertakers,
and both are developing beyond their origi-
nal scope. Melbourne Trust was formed in
1<)03 to deal with the assets of various cos.
that were handling the corpses of the
City of Melbourne Bank, the Federal
Bank of Australia, the English and
Australian Mortgage Bank, and (later)
the Mercantile Bank of Australia, all
of which crashed in the earthquakes_ or
the ’nineties. Owing mainly to the original
under-valuation of assets, the business has
been very profitable. In 1910 the Board esti-
mated its profit on the purchase of the Mer-
cantile assets at £28,782, and, after a revalua-
tion, wrote up its other assets by £145 205.
These movements, with the accumulations of
profits on sales and reserves, made a total
of £295,555, of which the Board took
£246,559 for a special bonus distribution in
4 p.c. debentures. It was almost as good as
cash, since the issue was redeemed for cash.
The last was bought in 1916. A small
amount of 41 p.c. stock issued for cash a
few years earlier is represented in the figures
from that date: —

Big profits were made on property prior to
1910 because of the under-valuation; but
with the revaluation the figures shrank and
realisations for some years showed a loss
on book values. But in the past few years
property values have again made enthusias-
tic progress heavenward. Profits from sales
are included in the profit figures of the in-
troductory table, which also include the taxes
paid by the co. on behalf of shareholders.

business is being overshadowed by the co.'s

Tlie economy of Pioneer Wood Pipe is stressed in
this report from the Great Western Milling Co., Ltd.,
which reads; “We installed wood pipes at our
Millthorpe Mill, and a drain to take away the warm
water from the condenser, and they are giving entire
satisfaction. Prior to installing wood pipes and
drain we were using galvanised-iron, which had to be
replaced about every two years. The wooden ones,
installed three years ago, are quite as good now, as
when erected.”—The Australian Wood Pipe Co., Ltd.,

President Hamilton, replying oil behalf of
the Westralian Chamber of Mines, to Royal
Commissioner Thomas’s sweeping condemna-
tion of Kalgoorlie mining treatment and
administrative methods, denies that the high
working costs of the mining cos. there arc
due to inefficient management, and declares
that, on the whole, Kalgoorlie results compare
favorably with those of S’Africa. He quotes
figures disproving Thomas’s allegation that
much more work per man is done in the
Transvaal than in Wcstralia, and asserts
that Thomas’s plan for reviving Westralia’s
gold-mining industry by amalgamations, cen-
tral shafts and plants at Kalgoorlie, and by
deeper exploration of out-hack mines, presents
great financial difficulties which Thomas
either overlooked or did not appreciate.
Hamilton adds that the otic thing needful to
revive the industry is a 20s. per oz. gold
bonus, lie believes that the payment of such
a bonus would result in the employment of
more men, the production of more tonnage,
the mining and treatment of ore of a lower
grade than is now possible, the better develop-
ment and equipment of mines, the bucking-up
of prospecting and the expansion of industry.

When Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) held
its annual roll-up in London chairman
Moreing announced that tlic expected
div. could not he paid. Things were
not as bright as they might be on
the co.’s Westralian mine, and its invest-
ment in the California Exploration Ltd.,
which promoted the Plymouth Consolidated
Go., had depreciated. At present the share-
holders’ most important asset was the Corn-
ish kaolin pits. The cut prices prevailing
for China clay had caused a restriction in the
co.’s output, but when conditions were more
favorable it would be immediately increased.

E. B. Jensen, mining engineer, recently
inspected the Radio mine (W.A.), and, later,
informed Adelaide that the show had been
incorrectly described iii newspaper reports.
Jensen said that instead of being a narrow
lode, widening out in places to three feet, it
was more correctly defined as an ore-bearing
zone of considerable width. The ore-bearing
zone or channel is there all right, but the in-
formation the public wants is what portions
of the zone hold the high gold values for
which the mine is noted. These are contained
only within the series of narrow quartz veins
which bulge at points to 3ft. in width and at
one place to 9ft. So long as this continues, it
does not appear to matter what width the
ore zone may be. The Radio is a rich little
show, the owners of which are content to
rely, in connection with the option held over
it, on the merits of its quartz veins series.
References to wide ore channels and what
not may convey a wrong impression of the
show.
# * * #
Wiluua Options Syndicate lias started
crosscutting at 300 ft. in Gwalia Consolidated,
and expects to strike the lode this month. As
the diamond drill has previously proved the
lode contains values ranging from 20s. to
£2O per ton, impending developments are be-
ing awaited with interest, not only by the
Syndicate, but also by the Mararoa and Emu
cos., which hold options on adjacent leases.

Paralysed Westonia (W.A.) lias hopes of
recovery. Someone claims to have struck
a new shoot in ground which was formerly
part and parcel of the old Edna May group,
and one or two others have reported good
prospects elsewhere. A Bulletin man who
passed by the field some time ago reported
that all that remained of a onee-prosperous
centre were some dismal-looking structures,
rusting plant and a handful of downhearted
people. Mining was stone-dead. Since then
the inhabitants, encouraged by Government
subsidies and a little outside capital, have
bucked up a bit, and a little gold has been
won from shows which were thought to be
down and out.

Ives Reward (W.A.) has at one point in
its so far unprofitable mine a stoping width
of over 30ft. of 425. ore. Unfortunately, de-
velopments at other points are not go promis-
iiig as regards width and gold content. The
manager intends trying to improve the posi-
tion by installing supplementary plant with
a view to increasing the output. Mean-
while three parties are watching pros-
pective profits with interest. The Mines
Department, by virtue of a mortgage
to secure cash advances, will be first,
debenture-holders a bad second, and
shareholders’ dividends a worse third. It can
be said that Ives Reward is showing slight
improvement compared with any time pre-
viously, but it need not look very well to
justify that being said of it.

The erection of the battery on Stanhills
tinfield (Q.) will be completed shortly. Cash
seems still to be scarce, for development work
is not being pushed on as it should be if
the dumps are going to be kept busy.
There is a disposition to wait and see liow
the Mauretania erusliings turn out. Many
northern mining men have had a look at the
field ; among them I\ L. Goddard and Fred
Reid, of Chi Hague, and J. W. Moule, repre-
senting Southern interests. They speak fairly
well of the field and have secured options. A
fair number of tin-miners from other fields
are also drifting in.

For the past three months nothing much
lias been heard of the Marvel tin-mine at
hjinut'ord (N.Q.), whose float went off with
such a bang last year. The original shoot
on which hopes had centred petered out
badly, and the ore formation, though rich,
was apparently only an incrustation of tin
along two joint planes, and not a true lode.
However, one of the co.’s other strings, the
Gem, has turned out well, and Fred Reid
is putting through a crushing which, the
mulgas state, will be good enough to pay a
comfortable dividend for a start, with a
likelihood of more to follow. Marvel scrip,
after being over par, receded badly on the
market and could be bought almost for a
song. The “Wild Cat” some months ago
advised holders to wait* for one crushing at
least before thinking of getting out.

The bottom is not out of the Philippine
Dredges yet, as two of its plants are in action.
No. 4 dredge last year earned 18697 above
exes., but No. 2’s loss cut that sum down
so that a profit of only £Bl7O went to P. and
L. Then snags like interest and other odd-
ments mounted up to £4399. depreciation
took £1823 and amortisation £1285. 'ln the
end the year's campaign showed a loss of
£3lOB. Still interest on the debenture
debt of £41,400 was met, but a mountain of
accrued interest of £18,500 stares the co. in
the face. Sundry creditors here and in
Manila are owed £4400, while £6150 is due
to bankers. So it is just as well that John
McWhae is on hand. Some 500,000 c. yds.
were handled by the two dredges for 42630 z.
gold, but No. 2 did shockingly. Bill Taylor
says this was due to its having to grope
through a big pond of mud and clay. The
plant will now have a shot at re-dredging
the old Maximalo claim where prospects
are fair. From November to the end of
February the. two plants provided 19590 z., or
nearly as much as the whole of the previous
year’s yield. When No. 4 plant got going
single-handled it set up this record: March,
5780 z.; April, 6820 z.; May, 6620 z. This
showed that when gold is about the co. does
better than almost any other claim now being
worked. All Telford will say of the future
is that wash ahead will give payable results.
He has No. 2 plant in working order, but
his wail is that bucket bands and buckets
on both dredges are ineffective, and both pon-
toons are more or less creaky—they soon get
that way in the tropics. Assets total
£246,091. Of that Paracale interests tot up
to £111,788. The two dredges have a book
value of £30,400 ; claims and rights stand at
£57.860. These items with the debit balance
of P. and L. of £40,439 account for nearly
£240,000. Of the balance of £6OOO. gold in
transit and firewood £2400 are the biggest
items. Philippines is a sadly-dwindled show,
and one that deserved better luck than has
come its way.
* * * *
Briseis picked up £6092 last year, thereby
cutting its P. and L. debit down to £8536.
That such a smudge is in the accounts doesn’t
mean that the co. isn’t financial. The manage-
ment, has been too spry for that. Even when it
went fooling with coal it kept cash in hand
above any prospective liability. Now it
shows cash assets of £28.672 and a reserve
fund of £26,951. That isn’t much to split
up among 500,000 shares, but it keeps the
old mine jigging, especially with tin around
£260 a ton. Lindesay Clark lias had to
work on variable wash since he passed the
run of rich drift on the south-eastern side of
the granite spur. He also lias been faced
with solid pug bars through which the nozzle
bored holes as cleanly as if hit by a cannon
shot. Blasting, he followed the drift round
the spur, only to discover that away from the
centre of the gutter the wash was patchy
and disappointing. Pug blocked quick work
in the way of opening up the central run of
tin. Hence to get returns he had to operate
in poor ground loft behind. His not return
for a year’s campaign runs out at 258 tons,
of which 245 tons came from the Kruslika
flat faces, the rest from tributors. The big
job of the year has been to have the Cascade
dam built in time to conserve winter rains,
and so give water for smashing down the
overburden effectively. That will lead to the
exposure of the drift containing good tin
averages, as the block barring progress can
be attacked from both ends. The job will bo
completed by Christmas if the rainfall keeps
up. Meantime, only the poorer drifts be-
tween the Ringarooma and the main gutter
will supply tin to pay the cost of work, and
perhaps yield a profit. With dead work
done a wider plan of attack can be applied.
• * * *
Warragul’s ambition is to be a Gippsland
black-coal centre, but Stanley Hunter of the
Mine’s staff isn’t having it yet. So far the
Gippsland coal industry outside Powlctt has
been the costliest State-subsidised concern
the Cabbage Garden has supported. Warra-
gul’s best are seams going from lOin. to 3ft.,
and Hunter wants to see the latter. When
it shows lie will talk boring. Till then he
is better employed trying to find out when
G. D. Meudell’s oil spots will make into
gushers.
* * * *
Mt. Patterson, Attunga (N.S.W.), speaks
of starting its battery in October, but in the
ordinary way the end of the year would be a
safer forecast. The old 20-hcad mill from
Mt. Dudley has been assembled on the 24-
acre lease held by the Patterson folk, the pro-
perty comprising one of the central peaks
which ruti through the belt of country from
Nun die to Barra ba. This hill is mostly sedi-
mentary rock, whereas all the surrounding
peaks are of granite. Managing-director P.
S. Graham, M.E., classes the show as the
best low-grade proposition he has ever seen.
SHc considers that the two big lodes can be
worked by open cut, and explains that two of
these have been put in :
One to intercept tlie lode at a depth of 60ft., and
the other at 25ft. perpendicular. These cuttings
are 80ft. apart, and show the same class of auriferous
formation. No. 1 cutting lias exposed a face of
auriferous crushing material 00ft. high, while the
lode has been sampled to a width of 80ft. across,
and is still going into the hill. The two cuttings
have proved a 20,000-ton block carrying half an
ounce by assay.... A bulk crushing' of 15 tons from
the centre of the face gave 12dvvt. over the plates
and Cldwt. in the tailings.
‘'The top lode,” says Graham, ‘‘is of tremen-
dous size. Near the south end it_ has been
cut across for 65ft., all solid crushing stuff.”
It can, he believes, be quarried out hundreds
of tons at a shot, and can be mined and milled
for 10s. 6d. a ton. The eo., which is in the
Holder stable, Pitt-strcet, is in 80,000 ss.
shares. Of these the vendors got 15,500, and
50,000 contribs. have been absorbed. The
14,500 contribs. held in reserve are now being
parcelled out. ,

4500 contribs. on'the complete share register.
Chairman A. J. Aucher made the unusual
announcement that the directors have no
intention of drawing fees until the co. is
on a dividend basis. The Butler battery and
complete outfit for recovering reef tin are
being dismantled for removal to the Flag-
stone. The N.S.W. Mines Department
valued the whole plant at £20,000 three
years ago. Unless there has been undue de-
preciation the new owners have made a capi-
tal bargain by getting it for £2860.

Vegetable Creek, operating the old Cherry
mine at Ardlethan (N.S.W.), crushed 2750
tons for the year at May 1, and from the
resultant 137 tons tin concentrates showed
a net profit of £4315 after mine and office
had been paid. Three divs. of 6d. each on
the 57,564 surviving, shares required £4317;
and £2 thus added to the debit at p. and j.
increased it to £1938. The vendors of the
Cherry property are still owed £739, after
accounting for £1286 paid off during the
term under review. Capital loss stands at
£120,735; There are 77,436 forfeited shares
on the books. A small flotation plant was
installed during the year, and its efforts
improved the value of concentrates from
p.c. to 67.1 p.c. The battery lias seen
its best days, and if the co. gets, on to further
ore chutes of an extensive nature, ways and
means will have to be devised in this connec-
tion. A 3d. call this month raked in £717,
and the kick from 7d. to 2s. 4d. in the
scrip indicates the cognoscenti’s opinion of
the latest development.

Hysterical newspaper accounts of the
“find” at Lucknow (N.S.W.) have encour-
aged a company-promoting group operating
there to renewed effort. It reports no de-
velopment work, hut is improving the shin-
ing hour by another flotation, the Marshall-
Longton, in 400,000 2s. shares of which the
vendors modestly take half. The document
breaking the glad tidings states that this
fledgling is to acquire a nine-acre area
known as “Norford’s Paddock,” a freehold
“immune from the provisions of the N.S.W.
mining laws.” The only immunity available
is non-enforcement of labor conditions.
“Immensely rich gold” lias been located a
• few feet from the boundary, and then follows
a quotation from the superlatives employed
in tlic original fit of hysteria. “The whole
issue has been underwritten,” continues the
screed. Applicants for shares will find the
directors in Equitable Building, Melbourne,
hut the gentlemen are not named. Priority
will be given to shareholders in Lucknow
Amalgamated, Extension and North e.Ex-
tended cos,, the lot containing 000,000 2s.
shares. If they absorb the current offering,
MarshalLLongton and co. will be the (i.11.Q.
of 1,300,000 2s shares, of which half are
drones. Meantime, there is no evidence of
further shots being put in to shatter or con-
firm the impressions excited by sensational
journalism.
Ronpibon (Siam) got 28 tons from 120.000
yards for .Tune. The May return of 21?.
tons and similar percentage for the first half
of June prompted the Board to cable the
manager, suggesting a change of policy. The
idea was to abandon the tailings and turn
the plant into virgin ground. The buck-up
of 18 tons for the second half of June, how-
ever, emboldened the management to con-
tinue in the tailings for another three months.

Lieut.General
HARRY
CHAUVEL, who
has reported that
the Australian
military forces are
“in a serious con-
dition in regard to
war material .”
After suffering for more than two years
from mental trouble, E. J. Russell, one of .
Vic.’s six in the Senate, passed out on Satur- j
day morning. A native of Warrnambool
and a very fluent speaker, Russell got into
the Senate in 1906, when only 27, and was
Assistant Minister at 35. During the war
period he worked under great stress and
strain. When Labor showed Hughes the;
door, Russell walked out with him, and as
a reward w T as made Vice-President of the
Executive Council, a job he held from March,
1918, till December, 1921. It was not long'
after his retirement from Ministerial office
that he showed the first painful signs of
the disease which was to overcloud his
intellect and cause his early death.
“Staff”: A precedent for N.S.W. Speaker
Dooley’s discarding the wig (B. 9/7/’25)
was established in 1910, when Charlie
McDonald, Speaker of the Reps., and Harry
Turley, President of the Senate, declared
wig, gown, mace and other flummeries
“black,” as far as they were concerned. Not
long after Turley was installed two young
visitors from England found their way into
the public gallery. Sorely puzzled as to the
position ho occupied, they beckdned a mes-
senger from whom they sought enlightenment.
On being told he was the President they were
awe-stricken. “Doesn’t he wear a wig,” they
asked. “No,” replied the messenger, “but he
could dashed well do with one!” Turley
was as bald as a billiard-ball.
Goble and De Pinedo, the men in charge
of the two successful Australian Bight flights,
offered a striking study in contrasts. Goble
and Mclntyre co-ordinated as friends and
partners, but Pinedo always remembered
that he was marchese as well as pilot. His
companion was laborer and valet, as well as
mechanic. At one portlet, on their way
from the beach to the only residence,
Pinedo, who was walking unencumbered,
threw his coat to his mechanic —already
hardly visible and struggling uuder a load of
baggage—to carry. The half-dozen inhabi-
tants gasped.
In a few years, perhaps, a Government
with the numbers against it may wire-
less to one of its members absent in Pata-
gonia and get a few supporters to stonewall
until he returns through the blue; but actu-
ally the first use of the ’plane in Parlia-
mentary warfare was made in Victoria last
week. The Bruce-Page Government was
short of a vote in the Senate. Pastoralist
Guthrie was known to be at Geelong, his
political fortress, but the difficulty was to
get hold of him and deposit him on the pre-
mises before the division was taken. How-
ever, the summons from the Government
Whip, Walter Duncan, found him ready for
anything. A ’plane shot him swiftly over
the distance to Williamstown, whence a car
rushed him to Parliament House just in time
to record his vote and save the situation.
Joe Coates, M.L.C., Minister without pay
in the N.S.W. Lang Government, is the wit
of that combination. His happiest speech
in the playful line was made at a manu-
facturers’ dinner. “I have pleasure in
rising,” he said, “from my Austrian chair
and asking you to raise your Belgian glasses
off the Irish linen before you. and charge them
with the Scotch whisky with which you are
to drink the toast of ‘Australian Manufac
tnrers.’ Neither the I’reach dishes, nor the
devilled sardines from Scandinavia, nor yet
the Californian asparagus you ate and have
advertised by eating to-night need detract
from your proper appreciation of the toast,
though somehow they suggest a more appro-
priate setting for the next occasion you meet
to honor it.” Then Joseph solemnly poured
some Australian water in his Caledonian
usquebaugh and drank.
Jarrahland lost a cheerful soul when Austin
Alvis Horan went west. A railwayman from
N. S. Wales, Horan joined the W.A. service
in the roaring days of the goldfields, and won
the Yilgarn seat for Labor in 1904. holding
it for seven years. A man of genuine capa-
city, he had his full share of buffets before
and after he left the Labor party, but his
temperament was such that he could neither
bear malice nor even animosity. Though past
the military age, lie managed to get into the
ranks of the Sappers in the early days of
the war, and took his share of the campaign-
ing hardships and climatic rigors which
pressed so heavily on men whose health was
no longer robust. He retained his sunny
humanness to the end.
The D. and W. Murray co., which has
branches in several States, is losing from its*
head office in Adelaide two of its oldest
identities: John Tassie, chairman of
directors, and A. M. Pettinger, secretary
and also a director; the latter retires after
50 years’ service, and Tassie after 52.
Pettinger is a little all-round athlete who
was prominent in the early days of S.A.
cricket and the later days of bowls, doing
good,work also in football, baseball, lacrosse,
and with the sporting gun. He once finished
second in an amateur steeplechase on the
old Lockleys course. As a side-line he plays
golf.
Rowan Macneil, the soldier-student who
has been appointed to the chaplaincy of
Scotch College, Melbourne, is distinguished
on both sides of the hyphen. Serving with
the 6th Brigade in France, he got the M.C.
and bar for conspicuous! gallantry ; he special-
ised in the hazardous business of conducting
small shell-hole forays in the enemy's lines.
»On his return lie went into residence at
• Ormond College, winning his B.A. with a
first-class at the beginning of last year. He
was president of the Melbourne ’Varsity
, Students in 1923, and is major in the
University Rifles.
Ernest Baynes, new president of the Royal
National Agricultural Assoc, of Queensland,
/has seen a lot of Australia in his time. A
; Brisbane, native, he made paper darts at
Horton College (Tas.) and the Toowoomba
Grammar School, did a bit of exploring in
Westrajia, and bad his share of out-back
station (life. But he is best known for his asso-
ciation with the business called The Graziers,
which once had a famous cricket eleven —
' some of the finest players in Bananaland
; were employees. Baynes was also one of
the fiW3 original founders of the Queensland
Ambulance and Transport Brigade.
As Grandmaster Snowball, M.L.A., was
preparing jjto undergo a surgical operation
for stomach trouble, lie was unable to lead
the revels pt the Battle of the Boyne cele-
• brations in Melbourne, and the very tame
affair had ilto depend mainly upon A. G. C.
Ramsay and Parson Worrall. Ramsay had
a short innings (from 1900 to 1904) as mem-
ber for WilliamstoWn in Vic. Assembly. In
the last 20 years he has had to trust to the
July fireworks of the L.O.L. for the trifle
of publicity he gets. Nor is Worrall so pro-
minent as he used to be. In 1906 he reached
his top-note, and got summoned to the bar
of the Assembly, where Speaker Madden, as
mouthpiece for the House, said a few scorch-
ing words to him.
When It. D. Boys, successor to E. La
Touche Armstrong as chief librarian of Mel-
bourne Public Lib-
rary, was a lad 40-
odd years ago he
and Stan Argyle
sat in the same
class at Hinsby’s
school, Kyneton.
Argyle, a s Chief
Sec., was delighted
to sign the papers
appointing Boy s.
There was no favor-
itism about it, as
Boys was next in
command to Arm-
strong. He will be-
gin with £B5O a
year and work up
to £950.
Prof. GRIFFITH
TAYLOR, of
Sydney University,

of Mongol.
The second session of S. Australia's _ 25th
Parliament opened with Lancelot Stirling
again taking the chair as President of the
Leg. Council. He has been President for
24 years and a member for 34. A great
athlete in his youth, he was amateur cham-
pion hurdler of England in 1870, being then
21, and again in 1872.
If the bill which Vic. Government intends
introducing to concentrate all medical ser-
vices (including school inspection) under one
department is passed, a new Minister will be
needed. Dr. Harris, Honorary Minister in
the Uppah House, would have an excellent
chance if the Assembly were disposed
to concede 50 p.c. of Ministers to the Plush
House —it already has two. The appropria-
tion for the present eight Ministers is £lO,OOO
a year, of which Allan t r, k'' <3 +’1450. Peacock
£1350 and the other six £l2OO each.
Australia’s longest surname, which put
such imported hyphenations as Cholmon-
deley-FitzStephen to shame, has been dug
out by Dr Basedow, and belongs to an old
woman of the Dieri (S.A.) tribe. Her short
title is Yangingurrekupulapaiawattimakan-
tana. Only the first half or so of it is used
in familiar conversation.
Donald Mackinnon, ex-Attorney-General
of Vic., and ex-Australian envoy to U.S.A.,
is beginning to look elderly, despite the care
he takes of himself. If he had not been so
well endowed by considerate forebears he
would probably have been, first, Premier and
then Chief Justice of Vic., but not having
the urge to bid for the biggest things he
was content with the lesser. In the late
’eighties he helped the great Iliginbotham,
then C.J., to consolidate the statutes.
Twenty-one years ago he was bluffed out of
the Opposition leadership, and next, with
loss of status, he took office as honorary
Minister under Bent in 1907. lie is ex-
pected to try the Senate now that a vacancy
has occurred. Vic. Parliament has a good
feeling towards him, and he might manage
to command a sufficient number of votes —
say 43—to do the trick.
The S.A. Supreme Court has broken, m
favor of F. M. Cutlack, its own rule requir-
ing a candidate for admission to the Bar to
have lived in the State for the previous
three months. Cutlack lived in it for many
years as a boy at Kenmark, and as a pro-
mising junior on the Adelaide Register staff.
He went to London to try his hand at jour-
nalism there, but later read for the Bar and
was admitted at Lincoln’s Inn in 1919, after
having been an accredited Australian official
correspondent during the war. Latterly he
has been a leader-writer on the Sydney
Morning Herald.
“Uramao”: Commander Frank Worslcy
will not be the only Maorilander with Algars-
son’s expedition which voyages into the
frozen regions to dig up the North Pole next
year (B. 29/l/’25). Gordon Burt, of Dun-
edin, will also join the picnic party. He
served his apprenticeship in the engineering
firm of A. and T. Burt, in the Scotclibyterian
city, and has done flying work in Britain
for Vicker’s co. Burt, who is 25 years of
age, has gone to Spitzbergen as chief engi-
neer of a steamer which Algarsson is prepar-
ing for the expedition.
“Alwyn”: Mention of the Red Cow Hotel
(B. 16/7/’25) recalls that contained in that
ancient Parramatta inn is a fine stained-
glass window, originally belonging to an
early church. Emblazoned on it was the
text “I was glad when they said unto me.
Come, let us go up into the House of the
Lord.” The two last words, however, have
been altered to “Tom Smith.” Tom was the
pioneer publican.
Tile Last Post recently sounded for John
C. Morris, of Townsville (N.Q.). Morris
served in the early part of the Boer War
with the first Queensland contingent, and.
having been invalided home, re-enlisted at
Townsville and saw the campaign through.
Staying on in Boerland, he engaged in theat-
rical work; when trouble with the Zulus was
threatening he joined up with Royston’s
Light Horse. Again laying aside the grease-
paint, he enlisted at Melbourne in 1914. and
saw service with the Light Horse till 1917.
S. Aus. Labor’s three candidates to run
for the Senate next year are .1. ,1. Daly, 11. .1.
George and F. W. Lundie. Daly is a young
solicitor and partner of State Attorney
General Denny. George is secretary of the
Fed. Locomotive Enginedrivers and Fire-
men’s Union, and Lundie is State secretary
of the A.W.U. Daly has had a shot for
the Leg. Council, George has had three tries
at the East Torrens Assembly seat, and
Lundie contested a Senate election in com-
pany with Hill and Butterfield, now mem-
bers of the Gunn Government. They all
missed.
Alfred Downward, Minister of Lands, has
completed over 30 consecutive years in the
Vic. Assembly. He contested Mornington
against the sitting member, the late Dr. L.
L. Smith, who practically made him a
present of the seat by losing his temper at
one of his election meetings on the Koowee-
rup reclamation works in ’94. The doctor
had an impediment in his speech, and while
addressing the navvies made some reference
to the “Murway Walley.” This was seized
on by some youths at the back, and every
time the speaker paused for a word they
interjected “Murway Walley.” Finally the
doctor became exasperated, and told the meet-
ing that if he wanted their votes he could
“buy them for a pint of beer.” That remark
caused over 300 navvies to vote solidly
against him, and he lost the election by three
votes. He managed to prove three of Down-
ward’s votes informal, but at the second elec-
tion he lost by nearly half the distance.
“Austral Scot” : Have seen one Jew wield
a pick and banjo with real heartiness. Joe
Phillips, an Adelaide hairdresser who tried
his luck on the Stewart Range (S.A.) opal
fields in 1919-20, was recognised as one
of the hardest battlers on the field. Joe
sank some 90 seven-foot shafts in three
months without once getting even patch and
color, but a Jew’s luck must turn. In part-
nership with another chap he set out sinking
abandoned shafts a few more feet, and the
first try yielded 200 ounces of saleable

“stuff.” On Sundays Joe would keep his hand
in by haircutting and shaving a few of the
gougers gratis. A local humorist once worked
a joke on him by gathering up about 30
gougers and sending them over to'.Toe’s dug-
out to be operated on. .Toe got level by giving
a dozen of them professional attention, and
then sending in a bill to the humorist. The
latter paid.
BALLADE OF RECTORY CRADLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Canon Charlton, of the N.S.W. Home Missions,
said it was a mistake to think that clergymen have
large families nowadays. He took down a list of
N.S.W. clergy to prove his contention; the first
41 names in alphabetical order provided these
families: 1,3, 0, 2’, 2,2, 3,3, 12, 4,1, 3,0, 4,
1,0, 2,0, 3,1, 0,4, 2,1, 2,1, 2, ; 0,7, 2,0, 0,
5,0, 0,3, 0,2, 0,2, o—an average, of only two
children per rectory.’’ —Sydney Sun.
Where are the old-time bucks and fops,
Figures that Leech and Cruikshank drew,
Gallants with whiskers like mutton chops,
Pegtop pants and a tight surtout?
Where are their ancient rendezvous?
Vanished and gone, reflection sad!
Here is a mournful query, too;
Where are the kids the parsons had ?
Where are the ladies in hoops at hops
Ere crinoline the sex outgrew?
Where are the bustles they bought in shops
ltound, let us say, about ’eighty-two?
Where are the names like Poll and Sue?
Where is the quaint-shaped Scottish plaid?
Where is the triple-hatted Jew?
And where are the kids the parsons had?
Lower and lower the birth-rate drops,
Faint and more faint is the cradle coo;
And many a godly preacher mops
His brow as in vehement words and true
He tells his flock what they shouldn’t do
And gives good counsel to mum and dad.
But where —ah, how do I know or you ?—-
Where are the kids the parsons had?
Envoy.
Where’s the old woman who lived in a shoe
Crammed to bursting with lass and lad?
And where (when a rectory holds but two 1)
Oh, where are the kids the parsons had ?

GIVE IT A NAME.
CRANK : “The great Fleet, with thousands of brave men
from the Dry Republic, is in Sydney Harbor. Ask
them what they think of drink.”
BILL: “ Strewth, a bloke couldn’t afford to shout for
that many!”
“Hasen” : “Gouger’s” witch-doctor, who
successfully bit bones out of a patient (B 25/6/’25),
is not such a primitive after all. At all events, he
calls to mind, and is surely own trade-brother to,
a certain modem surgeon of a much higher civilisa-
tion who had won a remarkable reputation for suc-
cess in bladder, kidney and gall-bladder operations.
Even professional colleagues were moved to wonder
at the unfailing correctness of his diagnoses, and the
inevitable certainty of his tracking the wily “stone”
to its lair, until, alas! one of them struck him in
an unguarded moment. It was just at the end ox
an operation. “Ah, I see you’ve done old Brown
at last,” said the friend, meeting him at the door,
“Get many gallstones out of hint?” The great
man’s thoughts were straying a little. “No,” he
said unthinkingly, “I left the dam’ things in my
other coat.”
“Pick": Along the ocean-front may be
found a link between plant and animal life. A
rounded nodule attached' to sea-washed rocks, it
extends from its centre what to outward appearance
is a pretty tuft of seaweed. In reality it is a living
creature capable of feeling, taste and quick move-
ment. Experimenting with one of these curiosities
I found that it could readily enfold and retain bits
of fish-bait, small shellfish and even a spent wax-
match ; but empty shells and live matches it con-
temptuously ejected. Presently a small shrimp
fooled his way amongst the living fronds. Imme-
diately he was seized in a tentacle grip. Tie gave
a convulsive struggle, and when lifeless was slowly
absorbed. Probably the sea-anemone can exert a
paralysing effect, on its victims in a similar way to
the electric-eel when getting in his punch.
“The Rumpus”: Re white-ants' nests
being appropriated to other uses. Near Alice Springs'
I once saw. an ant mound being used to great advan-
tage by a fencer, lie pitched his camp alongside
and soon axed out a fireplace in the earth monument.
Then he bowed out shelves all around, and levelled
off the top for his cooking utensils. “The whites
never touch your food,” he explained, “and they
are never curious about who knocks their home
about, or for what reason. There’s another reason:
no black ant has ever *been known to climb a
white-ant heap.”
* * * *
“Slam”: The common go anna is a tree-
lizard and gets the bulk of its food from nests and
nesting-hollows in the trees, but the smaller brown
and yellow go. of the arid parts, usually called
Gould's lizard, never ascends a tree, and is far
easier to approach and tame than the 6ft. go.
There is also a small variety, about 2ft. long and
covered with yellow spots, which is likewise strictly
confined to the ground, and is a burrower, though
usually found in hollow logs or under loose bark.
Where a dead cow is available this spotted go. takes
up its abode inside the carcase and remains there
so long as there is anything left to eat, or till chased
away by hungry crows or eaglehawks.
* * * *
“Itidgemire” : My Ron is farming in Queens-
land, and finds it impossible to work lucerne
hay. The dust from it gets into his lungs to such
an extent that it' would smother him if he per-
sisted. He has resorted to tying a wet bandage
over nose and mouth, but without relief. He can’t
last any time when stacking dried hay in a shed.
No doubt others have experienced similar trouble, and
may have discovered some cure or preventive which
they will pass on to a fellow-farmer.
* * * *
“Golub”: The N.Q. sea-snake (Enhydrina
ratal'dien) is not as helpless when out of the water as
“Bouragi” asserts (B. 2f>/6/’25). It infests the coast
between Madang and Morobe, and I myself have seen
one nearly a mile away from the
water* others have been seen
three and four miles distant. It
will not attack a human being
unprovoked, and when disturbed
tries only to get away. It can
move at a fairly rapid rate;,
especially on flat and level
ground, but the curious forma-
tion of the tip of the tail seems
to prevent its having complete
control over the course it desires
to steer, with the result that it
goes first in one direction and
then in another. The sea-snake
has been known to enter houses;
and some years ago a man at
Finehhafen had a narrow escape
from being bitten by one which
had found its way into his bunga-
low. Its venom glands seem to
secrete only a few drops of
poison, but the secretion makes
up in toxicity what it lacks in
volume, the reptile being more
deadly than even the Australian
tiger-snake. The natives fear it
greatly.
* * *
“Wingella”: “Mulgo” (B.
9/4/’25) would have seen boys
wearing bells had he visited tile
N.T. I knew of two kiddies at
Brock’s Creek who would never
leave their mother’s house with-
out bullock-bells on their belts.
They wore them for choice, but
the mother welcomed the innova-
tion, as the children were inveter-
ate wanderers, and the bells kept
her mind at ease. The children’s
bitterest grievance, however, was
that they were not permitted to
wear them when on train days
they paid their fortnightly visit to the township,
* * * *
“FY7” : The high price of furs has again
brought the murderous cyanide poisoner to work on
our western fur-bearing animals. This villainous
practice is illegal, but the poisoners are hard to
identify with their poisoned baits or water, while
the reward is so great as to make it well worth while
to risk a fine, especially the paltry £5 penalty
inflicted recently at Wagga Police Court. At the
same court another man found in illegal possession
MURDER IN TITS HEART.
THE BYSTANDER: “What are you looking for?”
MOTORIST : “Me blinkin’ mascot.”
of 25 skins of undoubtedly poisoned 'possums was
fined £25, though the law permits a penalty up to
£5 a skin. In addition to the ’possums, birds
and even sheep, cattle and horses are being killed
in some districts by the broadcast baits. The
only method of staying this wholesale slaughter
is to prohibit the export of fur skins. The St. Louis
fur market is the Moloch which is swallowing up
our fur-bearers.
» * # *
“Jimmy Possum”: There arc many bush
cures for rheumatism (B. 11/G/’25). One claimed to
give good results is to sleep on a bed of spotted-
gum leaves freshly-gathered, the leaves being changed
daily. I tried it once myself; but got the flamin’
spotted-gum itch, a holy terror, so badly that 1
hopped up and kicked the stuff outside. The inhaled
fumes of boiling gum-leaves are also claimed by
some to be a certain cure for asthma. I knew one
old chap who swore he had been healed by it, after
having been given up by doctors. Anyway, he was
sound enough when he told me the yarn.
* * * *
“Te W.”: Wild birds trap themselves in
strange ways at times. I struck a sparrow on one
occasion so tangled up in some coarse sewing-twine
it was carrying home for nesting purposes that it
dropped to the ground. Another time a “diamond
sparrow” (spotted-sided finch) volplaned suddenly,
having picked up a long strand of wool which more
than counterbalanced the float air in its bones. A
Queensland observer records that he found a curlew-
sandpiper on the coast with a cockle, a fairly heavy
shell, hanging to one of its toes. In this way,
occasionally, both marine and fresh-water shells arc
transported great distances. Small snails, for instance,
are not infrequently found clinging between the
damp toes of wild ducks, the birds having walked
Upon them. It is possible that in this way wanderers
such as sea curlews, sandpipers, stints and the
“Jack” or Japanese snipe, all of which breed in
Northern Asia, may have introduced foreign shells to
Australia. The eggs, as well as the shells themselves,
sometimes adhere to their feet or feathers.
* * * *
“Gouger”: “Fitz’s” (B. 18/6/’25) instance
of a black gin hailing a white man as her long
dead son has a number of parallels in abo. history.
The conception arises out of the belief in reincarna-
tion. Every white man is held to be the incarnated
soul of a dead black man. A fancied resemblance
to a departed nig. is sufficient to have the stranger
adopted into the tribe, admitted into social inter
course, and given a share in the common property.
Such recognition has saved a number of white men
and at least one white woman from death. The woman
was the wife of a sea captain whose ship was wrecked
on Prince of Wales Island, somewhere in the vicinity
of the place where the Douglas Mawson went down.
Boroto, chief of the island tribe, claimed the woman,
but this notwithstanding she was in imminent danger
of having her brains dashed out, the gins urging
their men to kill her. At the critical moment a
tribesman stepped forward and demanded her as
“Giom,” the spirit of his dead daughter. That settled
tire matter, and she was adopted.
* * * *
“Up Top” : Sun-heat, like everything else,
has its soft side if a man only learns to adapt him-
self to it. For instance, at times it is actually
cooler to be out in a blazing sun and walking
about than it is to be „ lying under an
inefficient shelter. I remember oppressive days,
unbearable when lying in a sweltering hut, that
became quiet bearable when I got out in the open
and commenced working. From shelter I’ve watched
men toiling ( in the hot sun with pick and shovel,
and felt sorry for them, but later experience has
taught me that they were actually cooler than I
was. To lie in the usual bush shelter on a broiling
days is misery indeed. Get up and do some work,
either mental or physical. I believe physical is the
better. I don’t know whether it is that a man’s
mind is taken off the heat and his hard-luck worries.
or that physical movement in some way sets up a
reaction that cools the body, but it is a fact. The
troops noticed the same thing on the desert. The
halts in the march were always the hottest, and
when on the move the unbearable oppressiveness of
the heat seemed to relax. So long as a man wears
few clothes, and loose ones at that, the act of
movement creates a draught that cools the body.
* * * *
“Albatross”: Tepunaki, our New Britain
house-boy, had crude ideas of waiting at table:
personal cleanliness and he were strangers. One
day, at dinner-time, he placed in front of me a
plate of soup, which had been annexed by a fili-
bustering “bluebottle” as a swimming pool. Dis-
gustedly I roared “Hey, boy 1 What name this
feller fly along soup?” Before 1 was aware of it,
he thi-ust his grimy black fingers into my plate, and.
retrieving the fly, dashed it on the floor. Crushing
it beneath his black heel, he exclaimed triumphantly:
“Ply no more master —he finis’!” and looked around
for applause. He didn’t get it.
A MATTER OF 582[?] MILES.
FLEET FOLLOWER: “Say, porter, how does
this southern train run?”
PORTER: “She goes to Melbourne in two
minutes.”
FLEET FOLLOWER: “Gee! And I’ll say that
little train moves some.”
“Coot”: Re “tarantula” or “triantelope”
(B. 2/7/’25). -Morris in his “Austral English” de-
clares the latter to be “a European comic variation
of the scientific name ‘tarantula’; it is applied in
Australia to a spider belonging to a quite different
genus, Voconia, a perfectly harmless spider, though
popularly supposed to be poisonous.”

OUR FIRFFRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ail night upon a nigged ridge
We camped, and heard the call,
Uprising from dark depths beneath,
Of wind and waterfall.
It seemed as if about our camp
Night wove strange mysteries,
And that a hostile presence moved
Among the shrinking trees.
As though brought down by unseen hands
Now snapped and fell a bough,
Now rolled a boulder down a slope,
Disturbed, we knew not how.
And once, when half the night was gone,
We heard wild waterfowl
High overhead, and thrice there rose
The hooting of an owl.
And often through the haunted dark,
That knew nor moon nor star,
To us a hunting dingo sent
His blood-call from afar.
Hand clasping knees, around a friend
We gathered unafraid ;
No evil thing could enter in
The circle that he made.
Without that circle, red and warm,
To do us lasting hurt,
It seemed a baleful Presence moved
Unseen, but all alert.
Our faces flushed, our foreheads bathed,
By that friend’s saving light,
We felt like long-dead forest men
Who feared the things of night.
Skin clad, with wild, dark watchful eyes,
Slim sons and claw-tom sires,
Of old, of old in ancient glooms
They gathered round night flics.
And as each fire launched ruddy spears
Against gloom’s evil brood,
They called it friend, and nourished it
With ferns and leaves and wood.
Like forest men in camp at night
In regions far withdrawn,
No star above, no moon above,
We waited for the dawn.
And, waiting thus, through hour and hour
Night-long, to stay our fears,
Our ruddy fire-friend leapt and glowed,
And launched his flashing spears.

IN A NUT-SHELL.
“This fuss about the Elect gives me ther pip. Wot do
we owe America enny'ow?”
“Twenty million quid.”
“Parama”: “Gelto” (B. 2/7/’25) states
that the New Guinea method of treating a cut finger
is to tap it with a short stick until the blood qeases
to flow. His idea, apparently, is that by stopping
the bleeding immunity from festering or blood-
poisoning is secured. The natives of every island "in
the Pacific, including N.G., that I’ve visited have
always tapped the flesh surrounding any punctured
or other wound to make it bleed. The free flow of
blood from a newly-inflicted wound apparently re-
duces the risk of blood poisoning, by the blood
washing out any foreign matter that may have been
left by the weapon, thorn or whatever happened to
have done the damage. I have always done the
same thing myself since first seeing it done by a
Mashona “boy” many years ago in Bulawayo. Tapped
long enough, the blood congeals and ceases to flow,
though I doubt whether the tapping causes it to
do so.

“R. 8.” (S’Africa) : From my information
regarding abo. religion, I think “W.J.C.’s” asser-
tion that the N.Q. tribes are without any idea of
a Supreme Being is wrong. N.S.W. coast natives
told me that the one religion is universal through-
out Australia. The proof of this is in the free-
masonry of religious origin, known to exist through-
out the land. When an old man has had his name
sent among the tribes his person is treated as
sacred, and he can travel anywhere and at any
time as a welcome guest. He first receives acknow-
ledgment among his own tribe as a great and
good man, and then to do him honor his name
is sent by messenger to near-by tribes, who reply
that they will protect him and give him a home
should he desire it. They in turn send their
messengers further out, and thus the word goes
far and wide, vows of protection being sent back.
Tile old man’s person being sacred, members of
the tribe are careful when walking near him that
their shadows do not fall upon him, lest sickness
and ueatn ensue. They will not cross between him
and the fire for the same reason. A Monaro tribe
was exterminated about 100 years ago because
it killed an old man whose name had thus been
sent round. Strange tribes came from near and
far to wreck vengeance. It must be remembered
that the abo. religion is secret. Only after a
boy has passed through the bora rites is the name
of God told to him. Women never hear it. There
is something Semitic about the abo. religion with
its rule of elders and rite of circumcision.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: I do not think many
people who know the real coastal mangrove will
endorse “Gouger’s” opinion of its value and virtue
in reclaiming and protecting the shores of Australia
(B. 4/6/’25). The home of the mangrove is mud —
pure, unadulterated mud—and if in time the roots
do raise a barrier against the tide of the ocean, the
trees may possibly die, but the mud remains in its
natural state or becomes frosted with salty particles
Which are inimical to all vegetation. These patches
become salt-pans, and along the coast of Queens-
land there are hundreds such. When a king-tide
happens, the sea-water rises a few inches over them
and stays until evaporated by the rays of the sun.
Then the stink is the last word in evil.
* * * •
“Gouger”: Crab life on most of the long
mud reaches in the Gulf country is a thing of count-
less millions and feverish activity when the tide
goes out. “Frenzied finance” is nothing to the speeding
up shown by the crabs during the few hours they are
above water. Little fellows the Rize of a shilling, with
blue overcoats and brown leggings, form close inshore
in massed army corps that 1 have seen cover like a
wavering carpet fully an acre of
ground. As the carpet hops along
one realises that it is really a
seething mass of toil, for millions
of tiny legs and clashing nippers
make an indescribable noise in
the air. Others, slightly larger,
seem to make their hunting-
grounds along the line where sand
and mud meet. These scurry
along in dense columns, the sound
oi their going being like a mil-
lion centipedes galloping over
crinkly brown paper. Behind them
their countless tiny tracks and
diggings are plain and Droad on
the spreading beach. On the man-
grove banks just above high-water
line, where the mud is stiff, more
civilised crabs make each a little
home in the deposit. These beaus
dress in scarlet with a black
beauty spot on the back. They
are very timid, but will stand
being admired. You gaze at thou-
sands of these red blobs with a
queer feeling of eyes you can’t
see staring back at you. Move,
and they’re gone like a flash, quick
as the twitch of a camera shutter.
Away out on the spreading mud
where it meets the sleeping sea
are far bigger crabs in battalions
of countless thousands, their
tunics glinting yellow in the rays
of the sun. These crabs are good
eating, but just try to rush into
the thick of them to catch one.
What a scatter! When you get
on the rough coast, the crabs are
quite different, bigger and
cheekier, and when between the
big rocks under water will dare
you to come on, with threatening
squirmings of big, green nippers.
“Herodot”: Not long ago I saw an ingeni-
ous method of attracting rabbits by night so as to
bring them within reach of a couple of waiting guns.
The apparatus consisted of a small portable battery,
an electric-light globe and about 20 yard% of wire.
The globe was set up near the mouth of a warren
and the battery placed alongside where the shooters
were concealed. When the light was first switched
on the rabbits scattered, but it was not long before
their curiosity drew them back to investigate, and
soon there were swarms of them around the globe.
When a sufficient number had gathered the guns
let fly, and as the charge used was small shot the
execution was great. Bags of over 100 were frequently
obtained, the light being moved about from place
to place.
DESTINY.
THE OLD HAND: “Do you know what’s before that young feller?”
FRIEND: “No.”
OLD HAND: “ Thirty years of asphalt pavement!”
“Yarrum”: Once I saw a defunct goanna
18in. long and 31b. in weight borne along for 10
yards by a colony of red ants. Some pulled, others
pushed, others again lifted. There must have been
thousands of workers, and they all heaved together.
A big, fat fellow stood off a bit well to the front.
He must have been a ganger, as his antennae waved
all the time, as if signalling to the toilers. Next
morning not a skerrick of flesh was left on the
bones. It had all been carried down below.
* * * *
The bickerings of “Nicanor” and
“T.A.O ” are not worth two hoots when it comes to
arguing about a single degree of difference in maxi-
mum temperatures, for the simple reason that liquid
in a glass thermometer does not hold its calibra-
tion. As I write, I have two maximum thermo-
meters in operation, both supplied by the Meteoro-
logical Bureau, and the closest they have ever been
together when registering the same air temperature
is four-tenths of a degree. Thermometers change with
age, so that in making reliable liquid in glass Ther-
mometers, manufacturers blow the bulb on the stem
and then leave the tube to season for a year or so
before filling and graduating. Even then the instru-
ments require checking periodically against standards.
Of the two mentioned, one has been in use nearly
eight years, the other about four months; a fact
which may account for, the difference. Household
thermometers turned out by mass-production methods
are even more unreliable. Boiling-point and freezing-
point are scratched on the stem, and the interval
divided uniformly. As the cross-section varies from
point to point, so does the degree indicated, so that,
even if two thermometers agree at freezing-point
and boiling-point, the odds are against their tallying
over the whole scale. If “Nicanor” and co. want
to bet on their records, they had better accompany
the figures with calibration data and corrections,
especially when they are arguing about a mere
degree, and also with a description of the shade
conditions. If these do not 7 come up to standard,
then the figures are not strictly comparable.
* * # *
“Akran”: It happened at Mac Dade’s farm,
North Quandong (Q.). One of the abos. employed
on the place was sent for the cows at milking-time.
His saddle, with an old chaff-bag cloth, was always
left near the kerosene-tin in the barn, and the cloth
in time became saturated with oil. jimmy mounted
his nag one evening, and before setting out for the
cattle decided to light his pipe. Having done so,
he dropped the burning match. It fell >on the
saddlecloth, which at once burst into flames. ' Jimmy
hau no time to dismount, as the hag sprang away
at a terrific pace, with the breeze fanning the flames.
We set off in pursuit, and found Jimmy alongside
a wire-fence, with one leg broken and the seat of
his pants burnt out. The horse we recovered next
day. It still had a little Of the saddle left on it,
but its back was one long scar which took 12 months
to heal.
“C. Coral”: In many parts of the world
the natives use a funnel-shaped basket or cane fish-
trap, the fish, which can enter freely, being caught
by thorn-needles which line the sides of the trap.
It is curious that,
though these traps are
found even in New
Guinea, the natives of
Torres Strait seem not
to have used them at
all. They use a basket-
trap very similar in
appearance, made oi
bamboo and the mid-
rib of the eocoanut
leaf, laced together
with two or three
varieties of bush cane,
but it is quite free
from the thorn device,
and is used with the
hands for sardine catch-
ing. There are three
varieties of Torres
Strait “weres,” as they
are called. One is
shaped like an elon-
gated beehive, some
4ft. or so in length;
another, much smaller,
is cone-shaped; the
third is a huge affair
about Oft. in diameter
at the mouth, in ap-
pearance like a big con-
volvulus flower. Th c
first-named is the one
now generally used. It
is worked by a native
assisted by others as
drivers, who guide the
shoals of sardines to
within such distance
that the trap-man can
take a long running
dive and scoop up the
silvery mass. Small
weres are used where
the sea bottom is
stony, and are gener-
ally placed in suitable
openings in the walls
of the big stone flsh-
weirs, attendant natives
holding them and cap-
sizing the contents into
baskets as the impris-
oned fish swim into
the funnels. In the old
days competitions were
very popular among
the Murray Islanders,
and the man who could
scoop up eight or ten baskets of fish put on swagger.
* * * *
“Lexel”: The recent floods on the N.S.W.
coastal rivers washed down some queer things. Few
people ever dreamed that the platypus still survived
in the upper reaches of the Hawkesbury until the
banker washed out a few of these unique creatures
and carried them far down the river. Even at Wise-
man’s Ferry, where the water is normally as salt
as the ocean, two duckbills were lately seen struggling
through the perturbed and muddy stream.
* * * *
“Mephisto”: “Artificial” is an ill-chosen
word to apply to the cause of crimp in wool (B.
11/6/’25). Whether the crimp is caused by the
pressure of the heavy fleece or otherwise, as long
as it is not caused by influences . outside of the
wool’s growth, it is natural. On reading “J.D.C.’s”
par. I went out and examined some of the wool
resulting from the “crutehing” of several thousand
sheep. I took the wool from the board, and found
SOCIAL ITEM.
“Our esteemed friend, Mr. Cawker Bung, is going-
home by raiL”
that, with a few exceptions, the crimp in the short
five-months’ growth of wool was just as great as
that in many of the long fleeces then in the shed.
That does not bear out “J.D.C.’s” argument that
it needs a heavy growth of wool to give the
pressure necessary to produce a good crimp.
IF TURNIPS TALKED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The motor-bike that barked at night
Tore peace and rest to little shreds;
A gramophone upon the right
Howled over the carnation-beds;
Next door a thousand voices rose
In clamor from a single room;
But there was blown across my nose
Perfume of gardens steeped in bloom.
More voices came, then honking horns;
And then the* motor-bike returned.
As if cows jumped on all his corns,
A hidden hero’s anger burned
In murderous, elevated speech,
While eighteen women broke in song,
Answering each other screech for screech
With high notes tenuous and long.
But still the garden roses bent
On gentle stems across the night;
I breathed the soft delightful scent
Of one great queen with petals white
That grew against the nearest fence.
I said: “Great Nature still has some
Small touch of decency and sense;
She made the roses sweetly dumb!”
The white rose heard the thing I said;
And on a sudden gentle breeze
She lifted up her perfumed head
And, speaking in a kind of sneeze,
Remarked: “We’re learning all the time.
We hear a lot the whole week through.
Don’t think you’ll stop us with a rhyme
From saying what we think of you.
“Though we can only whisper now,
All green things yet will have their day
And rise and make a. bigger row
Than all the horns of Judgment Day.”
The breeze died down, the whisper ceased,
The white rose leaned against the fence;
And then the storm of noise increased
And battered at the gates of sense.
The roaring of ten thousand trees
Came on a sudden down the air;
The yell of the anemones
Went o’er the moaning maidenhair.
And loud and long the climbing beans
Discussed their friends from row to row,
While little tender infant greens
Lifted their baby tale of woe.
Then I was glad that quiet reigned
So sweetly in a street like ours,
And that the air was never strained
By vegetable vocal powers.
T borrowed sixteen gramophones,
And started them around my bed
That 1 might get the real tones
Of perfect silence in my head.

A day which promised fine and then broke
its promise, caused the V.A.T.C. meeting
at Caulfield on Saturday to be the best
mannequin parade for several moons, oports
coats and ensemble suits were prominent,
a line of buttons, like tlie portholes of a
warship, down the centre of the back from
neck to hem being tlie latest adornment.
The American Admiral’s wife, Mrs. Cooutz,
cultivated low visibility in an unimpressive
coat of black and grey-flecked tweed, topped
by a black hat with a feather mount;
daughter Barbara likewise favored protective
coloring of brown felt millinery; while Miss
Green, the niece, had the smartest of rose-
decked felt hats, allied to biege coat, faced
with powder blue. Our Rear-Admiral Hall
Thompson, escorted by acting U.S.A. Consul-
general Anderson, extended a welcoming
hand to the Coontz cortege. Mrs. Leonard,
wife of Chairman Clive Leonard, was tidy in
brown. Mrs. Daw Taylor, just back from
the Great Smoke, was musquash-coated and
her daughter aired squirrel-covering. A
sympnony in tan hues was Mrs. ,T. Merrilles.
Mrs, H. J. Robertson, Miss Margaret
Thomas, Mrs. Ariel and Sister Eflie Ball
were a few of tlie feminine sports.
Geelong went gay for six days last week
in honor of the greyhound. At the Ford
metropolis was decided tlie Waterloo Cup, the
richest prize in the world, mark you, for
coursing. Dogs from all over Australia and
Tasmania competed for the stake of £6BO
and the £l5O silver cup. Other attractions
were the Geelong Cup and Steeplechase, the
Hospital Ball, a boxing contest and other
frivols. This year country visitors were not
so numerous; all the same, there was
a record attendance at the picturesque
racecourse, green as a pasture land,
with wattle-trees in saddling-paddoek
and betting area all a-blowing. Big
fields and excellent racing provided splendid
sport; between events numbers of folk took
a keen interest in the charmingly-played
numbers by St. Augustine’s Orphanage Brass
Band. President R. Vincent and his
wife presided over a tea-drinking contest, in
which Gov. Stradbroke took part, in the ti-
tree plantation under the shelter of a wig-
wam. Tailored suits and furs were the
general wear. Mrs. Vincent touched up her
navy with a ’possum collar topped by black
coque feather-trimmed millinery; her daugh-
ter Sammy was woollen-suited in brown tones,
with a felt headpiece to match. Mrs.‘Shep-
pard Grimwade covered a black-beaded
gown with a fur coat, her velvet hat having
a feather mount; Mrs. N. Faulkiner, of
Rockbank, wore a wrap-coat of check pat-
tern in henna coloring and tan-hued hatting.
Mrs. James Russell, whose home, Barunali,
is one of the show pasturages of the West;
Mr. and Mrs. Iven McWhae, of Ellengerrin,
Mrs. Jack Napthine, of Nerang, and Mrs.
Ormond Foster, of Boisdale, were of station-
owners represented.
A sort of exclamation-mark was put to
France’s National Day reception at the Con-
sulate, airman Pinedo circling in his ’plane-
above the chimney-pots and saluting the Tri-
color at close range. The ball of the Alli-
ance Frangaise at night filled St. Kilda
Town Hall and the Alfred Hospital money-
box at one and the same time. Tricolor
draperies and balloons amid garlands tvere
the decorations, plus a miniature Bastille,
with the flag and lilies of France, against
a black background. Alfred Hospital
Auxiliary and members of the Alliance shoul-
dered the work of the dance, and the former
made some extra profit by sales of sweets,
balloons and pretty novelties. French Con-
sul Rene Turck and his amber lace-clad wife
entered tlie ballroom to the strains of the
“Marseillaise,” Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, president of
the Alliance, who wore draped gowning of
reseda green patterned with gold, doing the
honors. All Melbourne’s corisuls and their
womenfolk were present, including the Ger-
man Consul’s wife, quite a remarkable-
looking lady with dark hair softly coiled
above an elegant figure wrapped in pale grey
with ruby and amethyst embroidery. Mrs.
Robert Knox was sheathed in silver tissue
with gold and brown lace. Very striking
was Mrs. Atlee Hunt, in apparel of Can-
terbury bell hue, traced with silver. Mrs. Nor-
man Anderson, Avife of the Acting-Consul-
General for U.S.A., wore black and gold.
The most beautiful of model coats in gold-
embroidered tapestry Avas aired by Mrs.
Fitcher, who was one of the evening’s sales-
ladies ; Miss Davies, in a cerise gown, was
also of the trade promoters. May _ Rimming-
ton, who glistened in black draperies* shared
honors of secretaryship with M. Pierre
llerry. Melbourne’s Mayor and the
Mayor and Mayoress of St. Kilda were among
the visitors to the celebration hop, which
concluded with the Farandole, danced amid
a snowstorm of confetti and a whirl of paper
streamers.
Conflicting rumors of what the men of the
American invasion like and dislike have given
Melbourne’s hosts and hostesses worried
looks. “In a year in this country I have
learnt more about ourselves than in a life-
time over there,” confided one George Wash-
ington to this Letter, as he worked his way
steadily through plum pudding with much
cream, a dish we have been specially warned
against putting on the menu. Perhaps our
visitors would like to do as Australia does
for once and feel like children on a holiday.
Kreisler, who packed his Guarnerius and
set out for Adelaide on Friday, had a noble
send-off at the Auditorium the night before.
The hall could not have held any more,
and the spellbound listeners only came out
of their trance sufficiently to ask for extra
numbers. A laurel wreath, a basket of
flowers and a package or two were the
fiddler’s gleanings, for which he only bowed
his gratitude. Mrs. Kreisler hovered around
the back curtain in her jungle coat, shin-
ing hue the moon with reflected glory.
St. Mary’s I-lall, Geelong, housed the
Hospital Ball, jointly plotted by the Waterloo
Cup committee and the Mayor of Geelong,
the proceeds going to the nurses’ quarters of
the Kitchener Memorial Hospital. Wattle,
golden draperies and shaded lights decked
the ballroom; and, as a gentle reminder that
every pleasure has its corresponding pain,
an income-tax notice was posted on the
door. The Mayoress, Mrs. F. G. 11. Ritchie,
combined white georgette, silver brocade and
white feather trimmings; Mrs. R. Vincent’s
black gown resounded with crystal bugles;
and Mrs. F. Broadknight was in grey
draperies bead-embroidered. Mrs. Jack
Murray, of Bri Bid, wore glistening black,
and Mrs. James Russell covered black with
a squirrel coat, for the hall was only a
shade or two above freezing-point. Mrs.
Jack Acton, of Frogmore, swished a charm-
ing frock of French blue, traced with smoked
pearls and silver beads; and Mrs. Ormond
Foster, who had an interest in the Waterloo
Cup, wore fascinating covering of Chinese
red, traced with blue and gold embroidery.
Mrs. George Russell carried off dress honors
in dull green lace embroidered at intervals in
ruby beads and gold. Mr. J. B. Blakeley
held up tlie duties of secretary and treasurer
of the hop.
Governor Stradbroke’s popular wife, off
color of late, has gone into a private hospital
for a few days’ rest. This looks as if she
will not be present at many of the A.F.
functions.
The awed silence which hung like a pall
over all Kreisler’s concerts nearly gave one
male patron a nervous breakdown. Whisper-
ing to his wife that he was afraid lie was
going to cough, he got from her a lozenge,
which, according to his own description, only
added to his misery. “The confounded thing
seemed to hit against my teeth like smash-
ing crockery, and when I tried to swallow it
the noises I emitted sounded in the deathly
silence of some thousands of mesmerised
people like the family bath-heater on Satur-
day night.”
This is Mrs. May Quinnell, widow of the
late Surgeon-Colonel Quinnell, who had
service m
India prior to
coming to Aus-
tralia. Mrs.
Quinnell, who
is off for a
holiday to her
native land,
has honorary-
secretaried the
Austral Salon
for nearly 20
years. Founded
about 35 years
ago by the late
Mrs. Hirst
Alexander and
Miss Myra
Brown as a
meeting place
for press-
wom e n, the
Salon is now a
social club
which gives
talented young folk opportunities for study
and chances of being seen and heard. T.
Humphrey and Co. made the picture.
It isn’t often that an ex-students’ annual
ball leads tlie way in frocking, but the dance
of Genazzano College Old Girls put up the
season’s record in this respect. St. Kilda
Town Hall staged the happening, for which
there were 57 hostesses decoratively clutch-
ing posies. Amber, gold and blue_w*as the
background for the dress parade, which fairly
radiated with crystal, beads and gold and
silver oddments. Mrs. Pei’cy Shelton pre-
sided in silver and cosmos purple brocade,
and Lady Hennessy’s daughter Sylvia, in
cream crepe maroeain and blue, secretaned
with Rose Bullen, the latter looking like a
wheat-field touched with crystal dew.
Preparations for welcoming and eJjter-
taining the section of Uncle Sam’s I leet
coming to Melbourne are not nearly so
perfect as they were when the late Magni-
ficent McCall had charge of things in 190 S.
It will be a miracle if there isn’t confusion.
Hundreds will stop away or just look in
at the State’s reception at the Exhibition on
July 31. They dread going near a cloak-
room or a buffet with 4900 or 5000 others

Before taking
up this fasci-
nating craft
the lady’s con-
tralto notes
were often
heard on con-
cert platforms,
and she had
standing as
a successful
teac h e r of
singing. A
love of the
beautiful and
a study of botany aroused her to the possi-
bilities of pastures almost new in art, and
the demand for the products of her deft
fingers has induced her to give up her former
career entirely.
Essendon’s Mayor and Mayoress, Councillor
and Mrs. G. A. Mitchell, staged something
special in civic balls the other night at the
Town Hall, Moonee Ponds. The path of
the guests was literally flower-laden, for
decorators had wandered over the whole
building scattering blossoms in their wake.
The ballroom glowed in golden lights, flowers
and streamers, and housed a special turn by
Curator Oliver of the local park, which
represented an abandoned mine strayed into
a Blue Mountain fern-tree glen. Sixteen
debs, made obeisance to Mayor Brunton
and his lady and their host and hostess,
presenting the latter with a string of pearls
as a memento. Mrs. Brunton wore gowning
of heliotrope with black and bronze beaded
and sequined covering, and Essendon’s
leading lady was frocked in geranium pink
with attachments of gold lace. The ball
served as an unlisted celebration to com-
memorate the coinplete linking by electric
tram service of the city and Esscndon.
The Quamby Club put the sugar of
remembrance into the cup of parting for
Gertrude Rennie, who goes early next month
to Westralia. Mrs. Crime Gardner, in rai-
ment of black crepe satin and furs with
black felt hat, was hostess, and Madame
Mina Heseleva warbled between the chat
and cake. Well-wishers included the Tallis
lady, wearing fawn wrapeoat, fur-collared
and cuffed; Madame Mortill, who burnished
up a black ensemble suit with ecru-lace
collar and feather-decked headpiece; and
Mrs. Kent Hughes, also in black relieved
with white, and ditto hat.
St. Vincent’s Hospital is likely to have its
specially-endowed bed for sick nurses, as a
result- of the pleasant hop at Carlyon’s the
other night. Of the organising quartette were
Mrs. R. F. England, whose green frock glis-
tened with crystal; Miss M. Quinlan, who
cheered black with orange; Miss S. Quin-
lan, a study in gold, and Miss S. Purcell in
black sashed with cerise. The entire medical
profession had left its consulting-rooms
empty, and many ministering angels welcomed
the chance of a one-step to the rhythmical
music of the Savoy Havana band.
Jessie Black, a student of the University
who took her voice for further development
to the Continent, promises to make good.
Studying in France under Madame Litvinne,
she lately sang for Hengel, whose approval
is leading to an introduction to the conduc-
tor of the Opera Comique. Gladys Petrie,
who with Miss Black studied at the Con.
under Miss Clarice Malyon, is in London,
and has come under the notice of the famous
teacher Dink Gilly, who has extended her
a helping hand. Arice Hornidge and Doris
Rose, pianists from the Con. also getting
polish in the Great Smoke, send word of
progress, the latter having the good fortune
to have Leonard Borwiek to wield the
shammy.
Newspaper reporters in a Melbourne office
have been supplied with a lengthy black list
of words, phrases and topics to be barred
while the nautical Yanks are in our State,
so there shall be nothing to break the
harmony of jazz arid mastication, as there
are about 44 private hops as well as official
trippings, the Fleet footers will carry away
the idea we have dethroned our old love the
horse for a mere one-step.
Althouse and Middleton, even weightier
than a couple of years ago, received a great
welcome from a crowded house, which in-
cluded a State vice-regal party, the Alberto
Zelman pair and some Taits.
The cosy Kooyong Tennis Club house
staged a dance and bridge party on Saturday
night to augment the funds of the entertain-
ments committee ot' the Melbourne Hospital
Red Cross Auxiliary. The enjoyable jollo
was socretarieu by Miss E. Spowers, who
covered blue gowning with a harmonising
shawl, and Miss Williamson, who wore a
simple black robe. Mrs. Walter Sproule,
J. G. Latham, M.H.R., Mrs. Latham and the
Victor Little couple were of the gathering.
Mrs. Barry Thomson, who has lately
figured in the film world in Louise Lovely's
version of “Jewelled Nights,’’ had the bad
luck to sprain both ankles when up at one
of our Alpine resorts recently. A forced
walk in high heels is blamed.
Gertrude Rennie, who was social editress
of the Evening Sun during its short shine
in Melbourne, is to be secretary of Berth’s most
exclusive women’s social club, the Ivarra-
katta. Miss Rennie was the original founder
and proprietor of the Quarnby Club, so she
knows all the pitfalls. She has been inter-
ested in many charities and hospitals here,
and is at present organising the Golden
Pacific ball for the Civil Ambulance. It will
be one of the. big functions of Fleet fortnight.
An engagement recently announced is that;
of Doreen O’Brien, second daughter oi
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. O’Brien, of Park-
street, South Yarra, well known in West-
ralia, and Captain P. J. A. Bartlett, late
13th Duke of Connaught Lancers, 1.A., sou
of the Rev. 11. .T. Bartlett and Mrs. Bartlett,
of Halstown, Cornwall. The prospective
bridegroom is of the batch of English officers
who came to these parts about two and a halt
3'ears ago and started growing sheep and
wheat under group-settlement conditions at
Leslie Manor, Camperdown.
Back in Melbourne for a holiday from her
home in Japan is Mrs. Lister Henry, who.
with her two bairnies, is staying with her
mother, Mrs. Crisp, at Auburn. The traveller
left Kobe a few days after the recent quake,
which, though not doing any damage in tin-
town, was the worst quiver experienced there.
Miss Adelaide’s addendum: —
The Glenelg Maison de Danse has been com-
mandeered by another bachelor committee for a dance
2i of them this time, with an Angas Parsons
son, Gordon Taylor and Basil Proctor among them.
Ked-sliaded lights and branches of blue-gum bedizened
the ballroom and on the supper tables sweet-peas
divided the honors with the übiquitous Iceland poppy.
The frivol organised at the Palais on the same
night by the Alliance Prancaise was of the fancy-
dress-optional and masks-imperative variety. of
the costumes, one of the most effective was Mi-.
A. E. Richardson’s mediaeval midnight blue and gold.
Miss N. Jcnas annexed first prize for being a
cigarette.
IV. J. Sowden said the opening words for the
interesting Phillips Fox-Ethel Carriole exhibition, with
the Society of Arts President (John White) to support
him. Mrs. Fox, in short-sleeved black satin topped
by a small black hat, was kept busy afterwards
personally conducting people round the show, and
saw one of the first red seals go on her husband’s
picture of the Temple of Love at Versailles. She
was teaed the previous day at the Lyceum Club,
with Dr. Christina Krakowsky, the Club’s president,
to do the honors.
Adelaide and Dorothea Spinney have had bad luck.
Throat trouble has compelled thg elocutionist to
cancel the balance of her season here, and she is
now busy nursing her voice back to fitness for her
Melbourne trip. At the moment she is resting- m
the country, as the guest of the Edmund Curners
at Reynella.
Under Mr. Winsloe Hall’s baton, the Glee Club
surpassed even its own good standard at its Town
Hall concert. Three Cavalier songs of Stanford and
the “Meistersingers” chorus, “Apotheosis of Hans
Sachs,” were the star items of the evening.
The resourceful Australian again! A small boy,
bound homewards from kindergarten, found that his
braces had gone back on him and found, too, that
progress clutching a pair of slipping nether-garments
was slow and wearisome. So he peeled off the
offending garments, slung them over his arm, and
went on his way—probably chilly, but otherwise
unperturbed.
The weather is doing scurvy things to the feminine
dress parades at horsey fixtures. Saturday, when
the Hunt Club went racing at Cheltenham, turned
on an icy wind that penetrated everything except
inch-thick leather. Femininity muffled itself to the
eyes in tweeds and furs and pulled hats well over
blue noses, so that each item of it looked exactly
like the last, except that some shapes were broad
and fat and others long and lean.

STOCKINGS
Italian airman De Pinedo was Sydney s
hero for a few days last week. He arrived
on a grey afternoon, liis seaplane a perfect
rhythm against the horizon, and those faith-
ful souls who had waited at harm Cove
from 2 o’clock till after 4 felt more than
compensated by the graceful swoop and glide
on which the Marehese entered Sydney
waters. Squadron-leader Wackett took
charge of the visiting flying-boat with a touch
that was like a mother’s caress, no doubt
thinking of the day when his Widgeon would
make as gay and debonair an entrance to
the harbors of the world. Brown-faced,
brown-haired and brown-suited, I nicdo
looked like an attractive bronze as he took
the salute from Italy’s Vice-Consul, and
gathered in the contents of a well-stocked
flower-shop thrust on him by admiring coun-
trymen. A dinner-dance at the Ambassadors
gave the birdman a chance to find his land
legs. lie found them all right. They were
still in action at 2 o’clock in the morning.
P. —He’s unmarried.
The wool sales in other States and France’s
Day clashing, the fall of the Bastille .was
not celebrated by the usual dance at night.
The lunch'at Paris House the day’s big
fixture. Here the Consul, in waxed mus-
tachios and a befrogged coat, greeted over
again all those with whom lie had clicked
glasses at the Consulate earlier in the day,
and a stream of the younger set. His speech
over the caramel custard and the champagne
was half in French and half in English.
The first half was a defence of France’s
post-war delay in paying up, and its policy
in the New Hebrides; the other moiety was
mostly complimentary to the visitors, ou
whose behalf Owen Cox responded in the
same tongue. Shipping people were con-
spicuous in the gathering. Two bearded
French priests from Church Hill were at
the table of honor, and Father Piquet, surely
the oldest inhabitant of Sydney’s French
colony, gave a personal endorsement of the
kindly feeling between the Australians and
the French. The gathering was prettily
rounded off by the presentation to Mrs. Hig-
ginbotham of a cheque for £lO0 —-the gener-
ous Alfred Wunderlich subscribed half —just
to celebrate the golden jubilee of her activi-
ties among Sydney’s French colony.
Mrs. Higginbotham is a daughter of the
late Mrs. Henri, who may perhaps claim
the distinction of being the first woman to
hold a salon in Australia. She instituted
the first French conversation circle, at which
all the highbrows of the day congregated, as
well as noted professional men. Mrs. Henri’s
husband designed the most pictorial of our
stamp issues, and was the first artist to
comment on the beauty of Australian flora
and its adaptability to conventional design-
ing. As a child Mrs. Higginbotham was in
the Siege of Paris, and she was the most
consistent hostess of the French colonial
troops passing through Sydney to the Front
during the Great War. Her bright person
ality and keen intellect enabled her to carry
on her mother’s conversational circle for
many years.
For 17 years the Sydney Rowing Club lias
rejoiced over its own existence openly and
shamelessly. This year the jazz shook the
floor and the rafters of the Wentworth, while
hundreds of men who go down to the sea
in ships forgot the stern austerities of their
avocation and filled the night with the infec-
tious gaiety of your Seasoned Salt. Veteran
Q. D. Deloitte was at the helm, and had an
attractive bos’n and mates in Mrs. A. W.
Shadforth, Mrs. D. McCrie Johnston and
Miss Norma Fyfe Henderson ; the trio wore
the ship’s colors, blue and white, in the form
of wristlet posies, and further enhanced their
vice-presidentship with de luxe frocking.
Town Clerk Layton was there, a stalwart
and well-groomed sign that all was well.
Poor Mrs. Cowan, Australia’s first woman
M.P., had a sad homecoming from the
women’s conference at Washington. Just
before she arrived word was sent to her of
the death of her only son, a Westraliari solici-
tor. During her brief stay in Sydney she
gave the women’s organisations the benefit
of her experience as a delegate in the politi-
cal heart of the States. But after she has
told you or the enormous energy and the
amount of good works American sister has to
her credit, Mrs. Cowan emphatically adds
that the Australian woman more than keeps
pace with her in the march of progress.
The girls and boys of Sydney’s various
banking houses have been responsible once
more for one of the most successful dances
of the season. For some remote reason
the flutter is always called the Bankers’
Ball, though of actual Rothschilds the ball
is as bare as a red-cross bun of currants.
The girls of the banks are the real money-
spinners, and carry out the arrangements in
fine style. This year some financial genius
suggested a series of small dances to clear
the expenses of the big affair, and the result
was a preliminary £5OO or so in the treasury.
The Town Hall was hung with rosy lights,
and lanterns blazed against the banked-up
greenerv around the balconies. The stage
was set with three large mirrors, and many
a girl who had had a rush day must have
felt, when she saw herself through the
looking-glass, that Alice in Wonderland’s
quick changes were nothing compared with
her own lightning transformation. Prince
Alfred’s will benefit again from the dance,
and a group of the hospital’s Nightingales
trafficked gaily in jazz caps. Nine snowy
white debs, formed a guard of honor for the
G.-G. and his lady, who were convoyed by
Captain Lawrence and Captain Mulholland.
When the vice-regals were enthroned on the
dais, the youngsters were presented by Mrs.
Charles Walker, the hospital’s organising sec-
retary, and Miss Edith Hall.
At 5 to 5 precisely, if not sooner, one
evening last week the Sydney typist snapped
her rubber band around the cover of her
notebook and the page of notes she was
transcribing, powdered her nose before the
mirror above her old jigger, and made a dash
for ferry and tram and train. For by 8
o'clock she had to be dressed and out at
the Palais at Moore Park to do her bit in
helping the Typists’ Ball attaiu the £5OO
of its ambition. And as at least 1000 girls
arrived with 1000 partners it looks as though
the £5OO will fall into the coffers of the Child-
ren’s Hospital. The Palais has never had a
greater collection of beauty beneath its roof.
Pretty, well turned-out, fresh as daisies in
spite of the day’s work, those girls were the
greatest possible argument in favor of the
flapper. Elaine de Chair came to the ball,
and brought in her train the Commander
Pullen couple, Margaret Macarthur Onslow,
Sir. Penfold and Sir. Chance.
For a week or more Kensington racecourse
has been the haunt of country people down
for the polo, and city-dwellers who love the
game have made the daily pilgrimage with
an equally religious fervor. The dressing
has been mostly woolly and warm, and
brunette in coloring. An occasional pure-
bred fur allied itself to tailor-mades with a
result extremely satisfactory to the wearer;
and fur coats sprang eternal on the female
back. Saturday, when Cooma just man-
aged to beat Muswellbrook, was a day of
such beauty that it drew a record crowd. The
Federal Exes, and the State vice-regals were
among the most constant devotees, and Elaine
de Chair and Margaret O’Grady were among
the early-doors for every match. Mrs.
Dudley Gibson probably takes the palm for
the smartest dresser. One knutty cream
outfit caught every woman’s eye, and on
Saturday her grey frock flew a cat-like
cape, and her hat obeyed the latest edict—it
was of felt in pastel tones. Horderns, Mae-
Oormicks, the Iven Austins, the Spencer
Rruntons, Eric Mackellar and other polo
devotees sooled the players on to victory.
Notable features of Saturday were the num-
ber of girls who “fagged” up—and the first
appearance in Sydney of the Oxford bags.
May Moore’s camera caught Mrs. Coates,
wife of Maoriland's new Premier, be-
tween the
moment she
stepped into
Sydney and
h e r hurried
flight to Mel-
bourne to be
in time for the
Fleet festivi-
ties at Federal
headquarters.
Her husband
is described
by Maoriland-
ers as unimagi-
native but
transparently
honest and sin-
cere, and his
appointment is
popular. Mrs.
Coates, who is
English by
birth, is tall
and graceful
and a magnificent dresser. A sister, the wife
of Dr. Gibbs, lives at the Australia.
The ball for the Kambala endowment fund
was in the nature of a personal triumph for
the two Misses Roseby, the school’s princi-
pals. Old pupils, their parents and friends
found their way in legions out to the Palais
to make the function not only a success but
a brilliant memory to these popular ladies.
Both Lord and Lady Forster and the State
Viking and his lady smiled approval on the
gathering,- at which Elaine de Chair and
Margaret O’Grady danced all through the
night. There were seven debs. —very young
old Ivambala girls—and the pretty creatures
were presented to their Exes, by Miss Rose-
by, herself a study in lilac and silver bro-
cades. The F. B. S. Falkiner matron, trail-
ing handsome primrose and silver trappings,
and Mrs. Bassett were among the experi-
enced heads that helped youth to run the
ball. A Dance of Fortune was a graceful
interlude to the regulation proceedings. This
was performed by Visione Lorraine, in a kind
of eurhythmic rig of flame georgette. Under
her magic spell a monster balloon that had
been pi'osaically enough wheeled into the
room burst asunder, and out stepped two
pretty youngsters who distributed lucky
favors among the dancers. Meg Maequeen
was secretary, and Alice Gill treasurer of
the success.
The tea-caddy is being rapidly emptied for
Dorothy Helmrich. Last week the Queen
Victoria Club, the Women's Club and the
Independent Theosophists worked up a regu-
lar social storm in the teacup over the visit-
ing singer. The Queen Victorians, of course,
served their buttered crumpet to an accom-
paniment of the best composers. These were
interpreted by violinist Dagmar Thomson,
Cecile Adkins and many others. At the
Women’s Club the Macmillan lady, in twi-
light grey silkiness, passed out the good
word, amr Dorothy, whose black satin frock
was hand-painted in the newest way with
what appeared to be scenes from the China
war-zone, responded over her posy of. red
roses, making happy reference to her friend,
the Cooper lady, who helped to open the
doors of artistic London to the Sydney girl.
Singing-teacher W. B. Beattie looks out
from this picture on thousands who have list-
ened-in to his
discourses on
music and its
mission. He
has a special
interest at the
moment, as he
was the first
singing-master
Dorothy Helm-
rich had. Mar-
garet Bruce,
now with the
Dink Gilly
school in Lon-
don, mastered
her first sing-
ing exercises
uuder Billy’s
tuition, as did
basso A. E.
Y. Benham.
Mr. Beattie
has a fine re-
cord of stage
work in Australia. He was with J. O. Wil-
liamson and Hugh Ward companies, and
was a principal in the first Australian per-
formance of “Pinafore.”
A wedding with a local interest crowded
St. John’s, Ashfield, with guests and lookers-
on last week, when Peggy Napier Robinson,
of Ashfield, became Mrs. Lindsay Aitken.
The bridegroom is of Burwood, which, as
everybody knows, is just round the corner
from Ashfield. The bride abated not one jot
of the conventional satin and tulle in her
wedding garment, and threw in a mellowed-
by-time Limerick lace veil for good measure.
Three attractive ’maids mingled mauves and
blues in frocking that suggested a Chinese
glaze; and the subsequent reception—over
200 strong—was staged at Kurrawong, the
home of the bride’s father and mother.
The White Pavilion! It sounds like a
tryst amid the meads of Camelot, but it was
really Anthony Horderns’ exhibition build-
ing on the Showground. And here the
Countrywomen’s Association staged their
Extra Chukka dance on Saturday. The night
was clear and cold, and the intending revel-
lers had all the advantage of a complete
change of air as they took the long, long
trail that led to the far-flung Pavilion. This
proved to be a most decorative ballroom.
The dome in the middle of the room through
which the light streamed is circled by white
pillars; and within their magic ring the
orchestra poured out music that was merely
jazz, and music that was the signal for polo
enthusiasts to burst into song concerning
the merits of the team they liked the best.
The white background and the brilliant (but
not hard) lighting combined to throw up
not only the shades of the colorful frocks
but the skin and hair of the dancers with a
marvellous effect. Truly in these times of
beauty-culture no woman need seek the sub-
dued lights of other days. Town and coun-
try and two sets of vice-regals came to the
party. The G.-G. and his lady, she wrapped
cosily in ermine, took their farewell ball in
Sydney with mixed emotions, especially
when the crowded room burst into “Auld Lang
Syne” in the most pointed manner. Lady
de Chair sported handsome blue and gold
brocades, while Elaine wore misty greys with
side panels of georgette to attain the new
flying silhouette. Margaret O’Grady matched
her Titian coloring with georgette in warm
tones of yellow. Four debs, dropped grace-
ful curtseys, sponsored by Mrs. Marie Hwine,
secretary of the O.W.A. Mrs. Pat Levy
and Mrs. Venour Nathan wore their slim-
ness smartly frocked, and Mrs. John Mc-
Kelvey’s legs emerged from a jungle of fringe
around a short dress of lilac marocain,
Doreen and Audrey Hordern were subdued
in black lace. Mrs. Studdy, the popular
president, defied • superstition and flew pea-
cock greens with an air that almost invited
the presence of a ladder to walk under.
Knoxes and Stephens and the Maple Browns
and the nice-looking Morna MacCormiclt
were a few others of the hundreds who
danced that they might not freeze.
Louis Nettement, Consul-General for
France, who was in Sydney 20 years ago
and then escaped the darts of Cupid, has
succumbed since his return to- the charm of
Suzanne Herchuelz, whose father is a wool-
buyer in the Masurel firm. The wedding,
which will take place before the end of the
year, will be as quiet as the bridegroom’s
position allows.
One of Lady Forster’s last functions in
Sydney was designed to stimulate interest in
the Infants’ Home at Ashfield, by combining
a meeting and tea-drinking at Admiralty
House. The Home is now in its 50th year,
and the committee has determined to cele-
brate the event by adding a new wing to
its scattered buildings. It was not only
interesting but heart-gripping to hear Pro-
fessor MacCallum’s lady, who has made this
institution the chief devotion of her life
outside her home, tell of its growth from a
little house in Victoria-street, Darlinghm-st.
to the pleasant place it is to-day. Behind
her a glass door that looked a panel, in
which was set a great tree with spreading
branches in the garden beyond, Mrs. MacCal-
lnm made her appeal against a background
that might have been specially chosen for
its symbolism. How many mother birds had
the tree harbored? How many fledglings
had it sheltered till, strong of wing, they had
gone about their own business? Professor
Mills, too, had a word to say for the Home.
He sounded as though he might have stepped
from a Neil Lyons story as he sent his breezy
invitation to everybody to “Come along on
Sunday.” T. R. Bavin ran the lawn-mower
of •introduction over the meeting; and be-
cause he is a modern he referred to the babies
who will never know their fathers as the
“children of the unmarried mother.” At
tea-time the group was joined by Margaret
O’Grady, daughter of Tasmania’s new Gov-
ernor, who might reasonably change her
name to Titianella, her coloring is such.
A word or two from Brisbane: —
Sir Matthew presided at the reception to Toe 11.
Clayton in the Elite Theatre, with Tassie’s Governor,
the O’Grady, on his right hand. His Ex. introduced
the stout reverend as “an expert in youth,” intend-
ing no allusion to a beauty parlor or a gland-
grafting business. Lantern slides of the Ypres salient
were shown, the spot where Toe H. was born out of
the death of Gilbert Talbot.
The centre of interest at the evening arranged by the
Causerie Francais for France’s Day, in the Women’s
Club, was a torn French flag hanging on the wall
with the inscription: “This flag was hoisted by
Australian soldiers on the ruins of the Town Hall
at Villers-Bretonneux when they retook the town
on March 27, 1918.” The Comte de Tournouer,
president, welcomed officers of the Ville de Strasbourg,
the evening’s guests, while his Comtesse beamed.
Clarice Cox, Nora Halford, Miss Manltey, Mile.
Laroche, Professor Henri and others dispensed the
harmony.
Barbara Sisley welcomed the Allan Wilkies to her
studio amid gum tips, wattle and pink roses.
The mummers are about to strike their tents, at the
close of their eighth week in Brisbane, a season more
than twice as long as they had expected.
Sir Matthew has been to Toogoolawah, where lie
stayed with the Cressbrook McConnels, and the
Country Women’s Association spread the cloth for
the vice-regal party in the township. It is his
Ex.’s farewell visit there.
Princess Rangiriri and her nine Maori maidens,
who will introduce the poi and other dances to jazz-
weary Brisbane, turned up in mats and feathers for
the welcome Mayoress Mrs. M. J. Barry extended to
them at the Town Hall. Brown was the mayoral
lady’s wear, possibly intended as a delicate compli-
ment to her guests.
The westerlies retired before the influx of people
for the vice-regal garden party, and royal weather
greeted the guests, amongst whom were Mrs. Glyn
Connolly, in Oriental silk; Mrs. T. .7. Ryan
in white; Leith Graham in almond; Mary
Macgregor, the Cumbrae Stewarts, Allan Wilkie,
Tessa Reading, the Forrests, Pixleys, Mottes and
Lukins. A visitor from Canada remarked that he
had never felt so cold in his life as he had done
for the past week in Brisbane, and everyone who
possessed handsome furs agreed with him. Sir James
O’Grady was with Sir Matthew on the terrace.
Fred Homer gathered a few pals in his rooms at
the Savage Club for the cheerful glass and sandwich.
Amongst the throng were Lorna Forbes of the Wilkie.

Saunders (he is Enid Bennett’s cousin and has

with the late J. B’. Archibald), Mrs. Greenfield,

SPORTINO
NOTIONS
Threfi-year-olds have won an extraordinary
number of handicaps on Sydney courses during the
1924-25 racing season, now dying. Four of them
to do it at Roseliill on Saturday (there were lice
fiat races for all ages) were Boaster (5 to 2) in
Ihe Flying Handicap, 7 furlongs; Moisha (20’6) in
the Rosehill Handicap, 11 furlong's; Sweet Tress
(5 to 4) in the first division of the Granville Stakes.
7 furlongs, and Wliizbro (7’s) in the second division.
Moisha, who is by Bowman—Stayiacc, beat a field
which included Ston.v, Mirthmaker, Dialogue and
Hermealdo, and did it with ease; but Boaster’s
performance made more impression on those interested
in the September-October events, for he vanquished
a respectable lot of sprinters in smashing style,
although it was his first public gallop for many
months and he can obviously be improved. He is
now charted as favorite for the Epsom Handicap
in which lie will carry Sst. lib. A black gelding
by Magpie—Galtec Princess,- in appearance he is
very like his mother, who was raced in Perth by
Mick and Dan Mulcahy, publicans. She is the dam
of those smart sprinters Chatterbox, Gael (a cham-
pion on the pony courses) and Gaelic Maid. Boaster
is trained by W. Kelso for Robert Miller, owner of
Windbag, who is being prepared for the Melbourne
Cup.
* * * *
The going was heavy at Caulfield oil Satur-
day, hut the mud plus list. 91b. couldn’t stop
Fiscom from registering a very impressive per-
formance in the Leamington Hurdle, 17 furlongs
and a bit. The S„ Aus. champion fell on the flat
in the G. N. Hurdle, and did not run brilliantly
in the Doutta Galla. Nevertheless there was a lot
of Adelaide cash for him at Caulfield, and at barrier-
rise it was hal'd to get 7’s. Showing a lot of his old
dash, Fiscom was always at or near the front, and
was galloping easily, three lengths ahead of Rear-
guard, at the judge’s box, with the fast-finishing
Roisel a length behind the second horse. Clan
Robert has been a disappointment in Melbourne over
the battens, hut he promises well as a ’chaser. Favor-
ite at 7 to 2 for the Godfrey Watson Steeple, 19
furlongs, he failed by a neck to beat another ex-
liurdler in West Wimmera, to Whom he was giving
.751 b., but lie was travelling much the faster at
the judge’s box. Silver Heart, the fourth horse,
also impressed. The worst away front a shocking
start, the Australian Hurdle winner made up
his -10 lengths’ disadvantage in a taking manner,
although not desperately hurried by Dynon, and was
Within six lengths of West Wimmera at the finish.
Loading' at the turn in the Murrumbeena Handicap,
II furlongs, Llanthonv (s’s) drew away from the
rails and took Peithias (7’s) and Vahvyne (4’s)
with him. This enabled Smoke Bomb (4’s) to get
through on the rails. The Holt brigade hacked
Smoke Bomb in large sums from 7’s to 4’s, hut he
was going very wearilv a head in front of Val-wync
at the close. But for the Llanthony incident he
would not have been in a place.
The Y.A.T.C. secretaryship, like that of
the V.R.C., has gone away from the junior officer
who was expected by most people to succeed his
former chief; in this Case J. B. Gargurevich,
assistant secretary to T. W. Moulo, was passed over.
The position has been given to T. A. Tabart, who
has been secretary of the Tasmanian Racing Club
for 20 of his 45 years. An all-round sportsman in
his younger days, Tabart represented the Speck
both in cricket and football. lie also raced horses.

“Hasen”: “I see,” said Peter Punthard,
watching two flies race over the bar for a drop of
beer, “that Moonee Valley’s putting on a real
American day for the Fleet. They’ve got the U.S.A.
Hurdle, the Seattle Handicap, the Ooontz Steeple
and the rest, though they forgot to mention the
Wet-and-Dry Welter. Reminds me of when Teddy
Woodbine was here. I saw ol’ Bill Betclier just
after the big race. He’d come a thud and was cryin'
about it. ‘Prince o’ Wales Handicap! ’ says he.
‘Blime, that's what comes o’ me tryin’ to mix with
the Upper Ton. Why didn’t they tell me that the
• thing belonged to him, and I wouldn’t ’ve tried
to take it off liini ?’” He paused to swat the
losing fly. “Now, if you ask me,” he went on,
“what they ought to have is a punters’ day. It’d
start off with the High Hopes Hurdle, and after that
the Tliis-Is-a-Ceit Two-Year-Old. Tlien’d come the
Have-a-Heart Handicap. The next ought to be the
Sick Punters’ Purse, and then the Comcanaveadrink
Cup. And, of course,” he finished up with a sigh,
“tlie last race’d be the Walk-Home Welter.”
“Centurion”: William Allison, just dead
in England at 75, was out of the rut in which the usual
racing writer revels. As “The Special Commissioner”
of the Sportsman, lie was the leading authority on
the turf the wide world over. A Yorkshi reman, he
was born at Thirsk, in the North A Riding, the
very heart of the Yorkshire racing country, his
people being well-known stock and corn dealers in
the ancient borough, which owns one of flic oldest
racecourses in England. At Rugby and Cambridge,
Allison developed a talent for Latin verse which,
CIRCUMSTAATIAL EVIDENCE.
“Dad went to the races yesterday, didn't he, Mummie?"
“Yes, darling. However did you know?"
“My money-box wouldn't ratlle this morning.”
perhaps, helped the sense of style which distinguished
him from his racing contemporaries. As a judge of
bloodstock and breeding, he stood alone. He founded
the once-famous Cobham stud, and lie it was who
brought his darling Musket strain back to England
by purchasing Trenton and urging Carbine’s deporta-
tion from this country. Mrs. Langtry was advised by
him to buy Merman, one of the things it is safe to
say the famous Jersey Lily never regretted, for the
horse rehabilitated her fading fortunes. A better
than Merman, according to Allison, was Aurum, but
after showing his trainer a great trial in England
the beautiful little son of Trenton —Aura went wrong.
Allison it was who founded and edited the long-dead
St. Stephen's Review, on which Phil May got his
first chance after his return from Australia and Tiie
Bulletin.
In the annual polo tournament, which be-
gan at Kensington last week, over a dozen teams
from the country and Sydney competed for the
Dudley Cup. Unexpected was the defeat of Muswell-
brook, last year’s cup-holders, by Cooma, which won
in the straight by 8 goals to 7. The game, like
most of the series, was fast, furious and individu-
alistic. None- of the teams show signs of having
learned much in tire way of co-ordination from the
South Australians, who recently took the Australasian
cup i'rotn all comers. The best form in this respect
has been shown by Harden, all of which team appeared
in the Australasian tournament, three of them on
one K.S.W. side.
“The Rumpus”: Entries had hardly closed
for the married ladies’ race at the briekpointers’
picnic when Mrs. Spotem voiced a protest in regard
to a large, bony woman, heatedly declaring her to
be lacking in the essential qualification. Under Mrs.
Spotem’s nose the impugned lady displayed the
thiid finger of her left hand, and, pointing to the
gold band, said: “That ring speaks for itself.’’
The dramatic defence did not silence the complainant,
“it’s a pity it couldn’t speak,” she retorted. “I’d
be willing to bet it would say it's borrowed, like
any husband you’ll ever get.” The fight between
Spotem and the bony woman’s consort delayed the
race half an hour.
The English amateur athletic champion-
ships at Stamford Bridge included a notable triumph
for Australia. Dr. R. ,T. Homier, of Sydney Uni.,
won the long jump with 23ft. 11-Jin., an English
record, an Afrikander, Steyn, being second. '£he
Australian was beaten in the 440 flat and hurdle
events. The 10-0 yards and the 220 were taken by an
American, Murchison ; while Riley and Schwarz also
scored for the States in the 440 hurdles and the
stiot put, respectively. Ripley won the 44 0 flat and
Blewitt the four miles for England.

Large crowds went to the dogs at Geelong
to see the destiny of the Waterloo Cup decided.
Open Fire, a popular choice, flattered his supporters
until the final, in which his opponent was the
Wodonga bitch Erie. The latter had eliminated
the S. Aus. representative Lady Hope. By this time
Open Fire was troubled with soreness, but sore or
not he could hardly have overcome Eric, who got
away with a two-lengths lead and picked up ihe
hare in 24 seconds. Eric earned .£6BO and a cup
worth £25 for her Wodonga owners, the Carter
brothers, and the township collected about £5OOO
in bets. There were 112 nominations at £lO 10s.

Patrons of the Melbourne Stadium who,
seeing nothing attractive in the programme billed
for Saturday night, stayed away in large numbers,
showed excellent foresight. Of the two ten-rounders,
that between Stan Love (9st. 9!b.) and Salvino Jamito
(9st. 8lb.) was a most inglorious display, and the
crowd was relieved to see the verdict given to the
Manilaman on points. It would have been equally
relieved to see the decision given to Love; and if
the pair had gone to sleep before the 10 rounds were
finished it would have been intensely gratified. The
encounter between Yank Hanneberry (12st. 8lb.)
and Alf Stewart (list. 1211 b.) was also a weariness
of the flesh. Hanneberry had no idea of taking
advantage of his big superiority in weight, and his
manner of hanging on to his lighter opponent recalled
the line in the “Comedy of Errors” —“Thou art the
elm, my husband; I the vine.” Hanneberry came
down from Albury for the affair, and a few years
ago he distinguished himself by a plucky rescue
of some people in a capsized boat at the Sydney
Heads; but as far as fighting is concerned, himself
he could not save. Stewart on points.
Sydney owns a new bantam champion of
Australia in Stan Thurbon. Stan met Jimmy Sem-
mens, of Melbourne, at Leichhardt Stadium on
Friday night, before 5000 people—fully 1000 more
couldn’t get in—and, after giving the Victorian a
great hiding for five rounds, knocked him out. The
winner weighed Sst. SJlb., and Semmens Bst. 511 b.
The new champion is a red-headed brother of hill
Thurbon, a lad Mho might well have been feather
or lightweight champion had he received a fair
chance when he was Stan’s age.
Eddie Butcher, the Westralian welter-
weight who was a Digger at 10, fought 12 whole-
hearted rounds with Archibald Bradley, of Gympic
(Q.), at Brisbane on Saturday night. Then one of
Boulder’s punches landed too low, and the referee
pointed to Gympic. Kdward was leading on points
at the time, but Archibald was apparently stronger.
‘'F.X.W”; English light-promoters have
a better sense of giving value for money passed
through the pay-box than their Australian brethren.
I looked in at the Ring (London) a couple of montiis
ago and saw a 16-round meeting between Charlie
Ring, billed as the middle and cruiserweight champion
of Australia, and Dave Magi 11, the cruiser champion
of Ireland. The disturbance went the full distance,
to a draw, and was rated by the management as one
of the finest and cleanest contests they had staged
of late years. The supporting items consisted of
three clashes over a 10-rounds route, and three of
the six-rounds variety. Prices ranged from 6s. Cd.
for a reserved ringside seat to is. fid. in the
balcony, including tax.
With the rubber won, the Englishmen
let themselves go in the first half of the fourth
Soccer Test against Australia at the Sydney Show
Ground. They got four goals in the first 20 minutes,
and thereafter were content to give an exhibition of
combined play and ball-control which some of their
opponents might well memorise for future imitation.
They ended with 5 goals to nil. Though most of
the Australians hare played together in game after
game this season, the side was less organised than
in any previous match, and individual gallery play
was more in evidence than ever. Lambert, at centre-
half, was a poor substitute for Edwards, and Batten
frolicked round him like a spring lamb. Spunvay
was again the best of Australia’s half-back line,
but was outnumbered by the brilliant English trio,
Hamilton, Graham and Spencer. England’s total
score now reads 121 goals to 10 in 21 games. The
15,000 crowd on Saturday brought the takings to
£18,350, well over the estimated aggregate cost of
the tour.
Having, with the assistance of two
Queenslanders, unexpectedly defeated the M.L. Rugby
League XIII, Sydney Uni. tried to lower South
Sydney’s color’s on Saturday, but South prevailed
by 8 points to 2. The students led by 2 to nil
in Hie opening half, but everything went wrong
with them after the interval; often their play was
too selfish when a score looked possible. Laphain
and Carr, the forwards, did well for the winners, and
Carr is a possible rep. when Latta gets too old for
tiie job. By overcoming Eastern Suburbs, 17 —10,
Balmain took second place in the premiership
scramble, while North Sydney went to third position,
Glebe downing it by 21—20 ; and Western Suburbs
surprised St. George, 21—12. South (20 points)
leads from Balmain (14), and only if it loses all
three remaining matches will it miss the medals.
All roads in Melbourne oil Saturday led
to ’’Essendon, where Geelong was tackling the local
champions; and. despite threatening weather, about
32,000 packed the ground. A fast, clever and close
game kept the barrackers roaring right up to the
close, but in the last term the Seasiders played
with a cool certainty that swamped the ’Dons’ eager-
ness, and the ultimate tally was Geelong, 11 goal-
-10 behinds; ’Don, 9 goals 11 behinds. Best man on
the ground was Tom Fitzmaurice, former ’Don hali-
back and champion high mark, now doing his best
for Geelong. The Richmond Tigers vanquished St.
Hilda by 62 points to 45; Fitzroy gave . South
Melbourne a further dressing down, by 84 points to
47; Collingwood collected 113' points to North
Melbourne’s 70, in a very willing game; Melbourne
jumped on Hawthorn with 102 to 46 ; and Carlton
pushed Footscray another rung down the.ladder, scor-
ing 66 points to 53. With six more matches to play
before the finals, Geelong (10 games) leads from
Melbourne (84), ’Wood and ’Don (8 each), with
’Roy (7), and'St. Hilda (6) next. The rest haven t
Buckley’s. Geelong is fairly certain of the “minor
premiership.
“Wink”; The most precocious footballer the Mel-
bourne League lias yet found is Jimmy Smith, whose
big stop from the lowest grade (State School foot-
ball) into Richmond’s strong team is unique. When
it was decided to make a Tiger of him. most people
declared he should first serve a term with the Cubs,
with them to learn the craft of the game, rather
than have his spirit and confidence shaken by the
wiles of strong men. There was no need to cuddle
this brilliant kid, however, for in bis League tria-
he played just as well as in the schoolboy game the
day before. He was placed on the forward line
for a season, and there succeeded, but when, to
fill a temporary gap, bo was sent to the back line,
bis true position was discovered. Here he developed
great talent and soon won a place in \ ic.’s inter-
state team.

“The Ballarat Miners’ Turf Club has decided to
insure its meeting on July 22 and 27 against rain.
The amount of insurance a day is £lOO, and the
period is from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., 10 points of rain to
constitute a claim. The premium is £lO 10s. per day.”
—Melbourne paper..
Old Fate, the grim judge, is at last in his box,
The course of the heavens swept clear;
The stands are aglow with celestial frocks,
For this is the race of the year.
See Dawn, the new starter! The barrier’s up!
“They’re off!” for the Met’orological Cup.
There’s backing, of course, for that plodder, “The
High” ;
There’s good money, too, for “The Low” ;
And quite a respectable wad on “Blue Sky,”
A pound here and there for “A Blow.”
There’s little or nothing on old “Thunderbolt,”
But stacks on the Jupiter Pluvius colt.
A bit of a rogue, so they say, is this “Rain,”
A rangy and long-striding black,
But fancied a lot by the “shrewdies,” it’s plain,
And “Stormy,” his dam, was a crack,
A shade under tens was the price that they got,
A iair enough figure among such a lot.
They’re galloping now, with the black and grey
sleeves
Of “Rain” many lengths from the lead;
Now something’s away to a break and it leaves
The rest with a spasm of speed.
It’s what?.... “Fair and Warmer” in purple and
gold;
A staunch a performer as ever was foaled.
They're into the straight and the field’s stretching
out,
“Blue Sky’s” running right on their tails;
He’s catching them fast. “It’s a moral,” they shout;
But look! Coming through on the rails. •
The Pluvius colt, like the flash of a knife;
Young Cloudy is riding the race of his life.
He’s cutting it fine, for it’s surely near two;
But “Rain!” rings the shout through the sky.
“He’s got them,” they’re shrieking. “He’s blocked!
No, lie’s through!
He’ll eat them!” And then a huge sigh:
On those dread isobars at the last lie’s hemmed in,
And the book, Ike Assurance, collects with a grin.
VICTORIA.

“Kerys”: “Piriti” is right in his assertion
that in searching for men with German-
looking names among the M.L. troops some
ridiculous errors were made. One Auckland
man who fell under suspicion was loud in his
protests at being sent back from the line. As
he went off he mentioned that he had spent
his leave op an estate in Devonshire which
had been in his father’s family for three
centuries, and that Lord , who was his
cousin and the possessor of the same family
name, would be pleased to know he was
being branded as a Hun, as would also an-
other relative, who happened to be a well-
known general. Needless to say, he didn’t
get far, and the subsequent wrath of the
general was quite up to expectations.
“Der Tong”: How these scientists love
one another! The now famous Taungs skull,
found in Beckuanaland and pronounced by the
Australian Professor Dart to be that of a" pri-
mitive ape-like man, is being discounted by
rival “ologists.” Sir Arthur Keith, a recog-
nised arm-chair authority on anthropology,
says that the skull is merely that of a young:
anthropoid ape. As he has not seen the
original, but merely examined casts of it
at Wembley Exhibition, his judgment seems
somewhat offhand. Outside prima donnas,
evening newspaper proprietaries and poodles,
there is no one on earth so eaten up with
jealousy of the other fellow’s stunts as your
scientist, and none more given to savage and
elaborate contradiction of his theories. The
anthropologist is especially prone to this
aggressiveness, and he is on safe ground, for
anthropology, even to-day, is a science that
can be moulded to one’s own pet theories.
No doubt Professor Dart will hit back with
some staggering evidence of his critic’s igno-
rance.
“‘Bill Bowyang”: Strict orders had been
issued to the guard at 14tli A.H.H., Cairo,
to search patients returning from leave who
bore upon their persons suspicious signs of
concealed bottles of liquor, and as a result
patients like myself, whose wounds would not
admit of their being granted leave, had to
put up with a great thirst. A boyish-faced
Digger was placed in the next bed to mine.
After his first afternoon’s leave to Cairo he
returned to the ward with a huge bouquet
which he presented to the sister-in-charge.
Anzac veterans scowled and muttered, “Only
a recently-arrived re-instouchment, and try-
ing to work a trip back home.” However, I
took a keen interest in that lad when he us'd
to whisper after lights out, “Have a nip?”
and produce a bottle from under his pillow.
The invitation always came after the bouquet-
hunting trips to Cairo, and many a bottle
we emptied in that darkened ward. He
always refused to tell me how he had man-
aged to dodge the guard with the whisky,
until the morning he was leaving for Aus-
tralia. Then he whispered, “When you go on
leave alwavs buy a bouquet—there’s nothing
like it for hiding a bottle in.
The wish was father to the editorial
thought when the Japanese newspaper
Nicm Nichi suggested that Uncle Sam was
aiming at isolating Bull in Asia when
he proposed a conference of Powers to clean
up the Chinese breakage; The Japanese
newspaper's suggestion that Britain must re-
establish her old relations with Japan, leaves
out of account the fact that Nippon has re-
cently made a dubious contract with the
Red Bear. Moscow propaganda and supplies
have largely brought about the present
uppishness of the Chinese mandarins.
Figures tell the same old mournful story
about South Australia. Last year 3035
dwellings were erected in the metropolitan
area, and 544 in the country. The expendi-
ture on buildings in the metropolitan area
was £3,695,260, in the country £476,116.
The population of the State at the end of
December was 538,506, and 289,914 —more
than half —are in the neighborhood of the
G.P.O. Even S. Australia’s virtues of thrift
and hard economy have been turned to bad
account; for thousands of comparatively
young men, who have made a few thousands
on the land during the post dozen years, are
loafing around the suburbs content to vege-
tate on six or eight pounds a week, seeing
that they can milk their own cow and grow
their own cabbage.
_ “Mephisto”: There is a hard-headed
citizen in Blackall (Q.) who is always ready
to charge a door and batter it through with
his bare head at the first try, provided he
gets a drink and someone else pays for the
damaged fixture. On one occasion he was
challenged by a sheep-farmer to an encounter
such as rams indulge in, and on the first
charge he laid the selector out for four hours.
There is an idea he ought to join the police
force of one of the southern States ; a man
like this could walk any Melbourne street
at midnight without fear of clubs or pieces
of lead pipe.
“Hamer”: The Melbourne Civil Ambu-
lance deals with an average of 11,000 cases
per annum, but during the visit of the British
Special Squadron it had 1500 calls for help
in accident and sudden sickness tacked to
its ordinary tally. Hence it is making special
preparations for a busy time when Uncle
Sam’s mariners arrive on July 23. This
means extra expense, of course, and the
Ambulance Committee therefore wants it to
be remembered that its annual ball on July
30 will help it to some funds. Anyway
people who don’t want to go to a ball can
send along a donation.
“Sixenate”: The Melbourne police have
made a few fair hauls of opium lately;
and at least one of the Celestials
who have suffered is still brooding
over the dark ways and guileful tricks
of the Caucasian. A furtive stranger came
to Ah Sam and offered for sale a number
of tins of opium, producing a sample tin ot
the treacly stuff, and asking £3OO for the lot.
Apparently Ah Sam was not a regular dealer,
but the price and a knowledge of the profit
to be made upon it tempted him, and he fell.
Immediately afterwards his premises were
raided, and the perilous stuff seized. But
when he was tried the charge against him
was one of having in his possession one tin
of opium; except for the sample tin all the
others were found to contain mere treacle.
The exceeding soreness of poor Ah Sam rests
on his conviction that the information that
he had opium could only have been supplied
by a confederate of the man who took his
money, and that, therefore, the guileful con-
spirators, getting a police reward also for
the information supplied, had scored both
ways.

A little Well-meant Advice to
Australian Hosts and American Guests
rriHAT Admiral Coontz has correctly estimated the measure of
■*- Australian hospitality is admirably shown by his request that
the men of his Fleet be not “ Killed with Kindness.”
The Medicinal Pro-
perties of Wolfe’s
Schnapps are due
to the presence of
Extract of Italian
Juniper. It is thus
a diuretic, which
assists nature in
maintaining the
purity of the blood*
stream.
TO AUSTRALIAN HOSTS this little piece of advice also may
be timely. During the festivities, that the visit of the American
Fleet will so fully justify, never fail to observe the rule,
“Have One Wolfe 9 s Schnapps a Day for
Your Health's Sake. 99
TO OUR AMERICAN GUESTS, whose principles will permit
them, when in Australia, to “do as Australians do,” the same
piece of advice is tendered with the very best intentions.
Wolfe’s Schnapps may be taken with Soda-water or Dry Ginger
Ale —with a dash of Peppermint and Soda-water, or in any High-
ball, Sling, Fizz or Cocktail. With hot water, lemon and sugar,
Wolfe’s Schnapps makes the best of Cold Weather Nightcaps.

HUDSON SUPER-SIX
The World’s Largest Selling Fine Car
After ten successful years the patented Super-Six principle today is responsible for
the largest selling 6-cylinder car in the world. Only a supreme and exclusive
advantage could maintain such leadership in the brilliant competition of
today. With such proof, can the Super-Six motor have any rival in importance?
Only Hudson Can Have It
It adds vast power, without added weight, size,
cylinders or cost* It almost doubles endurance* It
is responsible for the way Hudsons endure the
hardest service, free of mechanical annoyance, and
retain their new car vigor and flexibility when they
have become old in point of years and service*
Most important of all, the Super-Six principle
makes possible Hudson’s one great policy and issue
—to give greatest value for the money*
And today, economies possible only to the world’s
largest production of 6-cylinder cars give it value
advantages never held by any rival.
Of course the preference it enjoys everywhere rests
altogether upon this consistent supremacy of value*
Everyone knows its reputation for performance,
reliability and trouble-free service.
Today’s Hudson gives greater economy of fuel,
oil and maintenance, as well as added smoothness
in every phase of operation.
Low cost of replacement parts is another un-
matched economy advantage of the Hudson
policy.
Hudson’s high service standards, developed in 15
years of manufacturing and merchandising experi-
ence, are also a major factor in the satisfaction,
enjoyment and value of Hudson ownership.

At Sydney Palace in another week
The sadness of farewell will elond the brow,
For “Cappy Hicks” weighs anchor, so to
speak,
Eight roaring nights from now.
A portraitist of mixed quality:—
Echoes of Lambert are heard in the show, at
Horderns’, Sydney, of Marion Jones, the Bendigo girl
who won the National Gallery Travelling Scholarship
in 1917. Her portrait of herself (No. 8), clown
to the biceps on the little linger, might have been
lifted from a Lambert picture. Nevertheless, the
lady has something of her own to say, and in
places says it with decision. Her drawing is
almost invariably very vigorous, and if her studies
of young girls do not actually speak, it is because
they have just finished doing so or are about to
begin. No. 19, a portrait of a woman in
a Roman shawl, is a very dashing arrangement, and
in No. 3, “Red and Gold,” she has achieved with the
background and the red-gowned figure a color
pattern that is very pleasing. Except for Her nice
smooth-faced old ladies and her apple-cheeked children,
however, her way of simulating flesh is a trifle
prosy, and Parisiennes know how to paint themselves
better than she admits in No. 4. She has painted
the Right Hon. W. M. Hughes, P.C., M.11.K., with
the exalted expression that mounts his prophetic
visage when lie is about to open a daldia show with
a denunciation of Bolshevism; the portrait is efficient,
and earned encomiums from Paris and London critics,
but it hasn't the quality of revelation of a Low
cartoon. The still-lifes are distinctly, fetching—
except the dahlias (No. 15), which are feeling the
proximity of Mr. Hughes.
Sydney Opera House is still liaugiug on
the adieux or an revoirs of Dorothy Brunton
in “Little Jessie James.”
Cri-wards the Sydney crowds each evening
thresh:
Here’s Pauline Frederick in the dainty flesh.
And who would dare to say it’s aught but
clean —
"Spring Cleaning” by au artist like Pauline?
"THE STREET SINGER," AT HER
MAJESTY’S, SYDNEY.
Arthur Stigant us Francois —“O ’ow I ’ate
winmen”; and Noel Leyland as Bo[?].,
the artist.
A show of woodcuts:—
The conscientious artist, when he tackles a stubborn
medium with a just regard for its limitations, has
his reward in effects often superior to those obtain-
able with easier methods. The French and English
woodcuts now on exhibition at the Macquarie Gal
lories, Kligh-.street, Sydney, are, in many cases,
richer in color suggestion than some paintings and
more startling in their realism than a photograph.
The exciting shadows and dramatic high lights Jolrn
Greenwood gets into his pictures could scarcely be
excelled. “Cove Lane” (No. 14) is a real road
inviting the city-dweller into a countryside full of
interest. “The Free Library," by C. W. Taylor
(No. 21), is an extraordinarily brilliant study. In
No. 28, “l’Espagnole,” Hermann Paul shows that
the wood can express the texture of a shawl and
dresa as vividly as the appearance of a rain-drenched
path; and Gordon Craig is able, in the same diffi-
cult material, to expound his imaginative theories
about stage scenery. Most of the Frenchmen are
exponents 'of the futuristic cult, whose primitive
deities certainly appear more at home when carved
in wood than when painted in pigment.
* * *
Sydney Tivoli versatile Milton Hayes’s
meandering speech about nothing in particu-
lar, with its smart allusions to current
events, remains the brightest variety turn in
town. The imported Scotch comedian, Neil
McKay, is a quite creditable fun-purveyor;
but patrons of Hibernian extraction are be-
ginning to grumble at the absence in the
repertoire of the humor that finds a vent in
digs at absentee landowners and Saxon tour-
ists. Nora Jane and Karl have blended the
old style and the new in dancing, and while
the compromise is entertaining it is doubt-
ful whether dance-palace patrons will tackle
the intricate steps presented. Yvonne Ardell
and her violin are doing first-class work,
and “Traps,” the drummer-boy, is kicking
up more row than a gang of riveters on a
steel building.
Acrobats and tumblers are still the prin-
cipal features at Sydney Fullers’. It is
rumored that the infant who is propelled
into the air by means of a springboard has
refused to allow himself to be sent on a
journey to the moon by an experimentmg
scientist. Character-impersonator Estelle
Rose continues to burlesque abstainers
from roast pork; her Rebecca, who returns
from Mecca with a lowered standard of pro-
priety, should constitute a warning to flap-
pers with a leaning towards sheiks. From
Alec Kellaway’s expansive mouth there flows
a torrent of popular songs that endears him
to bathroom baritones, and there are people
with excuses for the jazz music played by
Linn Smith’s Band.
# $ *
A motley collection of eighteenth-century
American Quakers are going “Down to the
Sea in Ships” at Sydney Hoyt’s this week.
The plot is rather difficult to sort out from
tlie mass of minor details, but the costumes
are picturesque and the harpooning of an
immense whale is a stirring item. “What a
Wife Learnt” at the Lyceum, the lady being
a successful novelist and the man a rather
oafish countryman, exhibits a rather tedious
method of acquiring information; and the
slapstick humor of Ben Turpin comes as a
relief. The scene of “The Trail Rider,”
the Strand’s magnet, is pitched somewhere in
Kansas, U.S.A., where the incessant revolver
shooting by the local population would glad-
den the heart of any enterprising undertaker.
“The Right of Way” is being asserted at
the Lyric; and “Girl Shy” will be pushed
out of the Crystal Palace by “Quo Vadis”
to-morrow evening.
There was a touch of humor at the open-
ing concert of the Althouse and Middleton
combination at Melbourne Auditorium which
brought it home to the big audience that
tlie singers are men and brothers as well
as vocalists of distinction. After Arthur
Middleton had shown the range and quality
of his voice in Flegier’s “Tlie Horn,” the
particularly well-nourished bass-baritone an-
nounced his encore as “Shall I, Wasting in
Despair?” The audience, surprised out of
the seriousness it wears for these big
occasions, paused in a puzzled fashion for
one second before letting the laugh go; but
Middleton joined it when it came. After
that, there was comradeship as well as en-
thusiasm in the house. In a Ros-
sini excerpt the large voice skipped
as lightly as a well-trained feather-
weight along the rapid phrases at the
end. “Captain Stratton’s Fancy” was given
in forthright fashion, and “The Song of the
Flea” with sprightly sarcasm. Paul Alt-
house led off with “My Arms” and “Sound
an Alarm”; in the second number be failed
to develop the full martial thrill. The Meyer-
beer aria, “O Paradiso,” was better sung, and
there was tenderness in the rendering of Hol-
brooke’s setting of Tennyson’s “Come Not
When I Am Dead.” The “Faust” duet, “Be
Mine the Delight,” was one of the best num-
bers of the evening, the voices blending per-
fectly. There are further concerts to be held
to-night (Thursday), on Saturday and next
Tuesday.
The New Princess, Melbourne, home of
“No, No, Nanette,” is still housing as many
people as it can accommodate. A large pro-
portion of them are married ladies who
visibly approve of the sentiment that “the
only way to keep a husband straight is to
keep him broke.”
Muriel Starr will cease to expose the
“Secrets” of a matrimonial life full of a
sweet devotion at the end of this week;
and, leaving the Melbourne Royal for the
King’s, will on Saturday night produce
“The Pelicans.” A play with a name like
that ought to prove as strong a bill as the
managerial announcements say it is; but
this Showman sees the passing of the deli-
cate “Secrets” with regret
“KID BOOTS," AT HIS MAJESTY’S,
MELBOURNE.
Josie Melville, Gco. Volluire and
Gladys Hermes.
Thurston Hull is moving' from Melbourne
King's to the Royal, where on Saturday, for
the last five nights of his season, he will
revive “So This Is London,” while the
elaborate props, of “The Broken Wing” are
moved to where they will bo wanted next.
“Wildflower,” with Marie Burke, whom Mel-
bourne last saw in vaudeville, will presently
bloom on the stage of the ancient Royal.
Fogbound art:—
Miss Clarice Beckett makes so much use of fog-
in her landscapes that occasionally she loses herself
in it. Into the 5S canvases she is showing at the
Athenseum Hall, Melbourne, the mist creeps so often
as to get a trifle monotonous. Several, however,
show under the pall considerable delicacy of treat-
ment. There is atmosphere in “Sultry Morning” (No.
4) and in “Frosty Sunrise” (No. 245), and there are
appropriate effects in' “The Dark Pool” (No. 7) and
“Early Morning” (No. 1). Insufficient consideration
has been paid to the rights of foliage, except iu
the flower studies, in which the artist is uniformly
successful; a nice tone is secured in “Amethyst”
(No. 31), and “Chrysanthemums” (No. 27) is par-
ticularly harmonious.
Gladys Hermes is back again in “Kid
Roots,” _ at His Majesty’s, Melbourne, and
adds brightness to the show. Which is say-
ing nothing against the work of her substi-
tute, Nellie Hutton, who did very well.
Yvonne Banvard, a brisk young dancer and
comedienne with a personality that gives
life to her not very original specialties, has
joined the Lee White co., which holds the
fort at the Melbourne Athenaeum.
Harrington Reynolds improves on
acquaintance as he speeds off his yarns at ,
the Now Palace, where “Snap,” with a slight '
reshuffling of the turns, remains as incon
sequential and as full of levity as a revue
should be.
Kreisler moved on after his “final” con-
cert at the Auditorium last Thursday, leav-
ing Melbourne still unsatisfied. On his way
back to Sydney from Adelaide the Austrian
is to squeeze in a matinee performance this
afternoon.
“The Oojah Bird” is an Eastern fruit of
some kind (at least the references to it at.
the Bijou suggest that it is either that or
a variety of noxious weed) ; and by putting
himself and his co. into ari Oriental setting
George Wallace has succeeded in giving
about the best of his shows to date. Par-
ticularly bright, as rendered by George with
the assistance of Sadie Gale, is a hit of very
old nonsense about instructing an amateur
to be a waiter. The rest of the programme
keeps up the average; and the Reverend
Frank Gorman, growing throaty and stagey,
is back again. It is so many years “since the
reverend gentleman arrived with the procla-
mation that lie had gone into vaudeville for
the benefit of the church, in order that he
might return to it with money that would
enable him to minister untrammelled'by finan-
cial considerations, that one is encouraged
to hope the day is not far distant when he
will return to the church for the benefit of
vaudeville.
Syd Moorehouse, a comedy merchant who
interlards his not exactly extravagant humor
with some hollow-sounding sentiments about
the joys of vagabondage and some sob-sturt
about the dead wife and che-ild, made a first
appearance at the Melbourne Tivoli on
Saturday, but his leading act is quite an old
friend. Whether he deserves sympathy as
one of the numerous victims of tlije
vaudeville pirate or condemnation for a
lack of enterprise in not looking for fresh
material remains an unsettled ' question.
Harry Green is still clinging to “The Cherry
Tree,” from which, it is understood, he will
be shaken on Saturday. It is a good act,
anyway. Ernest Hastings, Iris and Phyllis
and Keith Desmond continue to please.
“The Midnight Express” rushes a drama
of thrill across the screen at Melbourne
Majestic, where “The Riders Of the Sand
Storm” certainly does not let up the whirl
of action. “Down to the Sea in Ships” is
a pleasing film shown at Hoyt’s De Luxe,
and “Rulin’ Pretty” supports it. . “The Ten
Commandments” has finished its Gaiety
revival.
“Whirled Into Happiness,” at Adelaide
Royal, is not a great play. There is much
old humor (“Say Your Grace” out of the
ancient “Dorothy,” for instance), and ■ the
long shaving scene is just horse-play. Still,
audiences seem to love it all. Much of the
effect is due to the sheer charm, of Maud
Fane, the cleverness of Winnie Collins
(though her strong French accent does not
help a clever American song which is dragged
in), the unctuous humor of Kelleway and
the bustling low comedy of Blake Adams.
Also, the .many athletic dancers actually con-
trive some new thrills. Kreisler’s fiddle is
just arriving, but Dorothea Spinney has a
throat, and has had to cancel her instructive
and interesting recitals. Tn pictures, “The
Ten Commandments” is of course pie for
the Adelaide taste, and Wondergraph lias to
use its House-Full notices; West’s, Pav. and
York are very American just now. The
P. of Wales has the old “When London
Sleeps” drama, with the idol scene climax.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : The latest hour for the
curtain to rise on any show that I can re-
collect was a few minutes to 10. Having
taken the co. away from the railway line to
avoid a clash with two circuses, I found my
heart down to my boots when at 8.30 there
was not a soul in the hall, and two small
boys outside, in response to an offer of
tickets for taking round the bell, said they
didn’t want to see the show. There seemed
iio reason for any hope in a town where small
boys were not eager to go in on the nod ;
but the hotelkeeper comforted me With
flagons, and told me that people thereabouts
didn’t arrive until late. They didn’t; but
when they came it was with a rush. The
subsequent difficulty was in rousing the play-
ers, who had decided that there would be no

performance, and had gone to their beds
early to make sure of them; and in the
rush I forgot that I had to scramble into
kneebreeclies and stockings and “open” the
piece. It was a packed house, the lateness
in its arrival being due to the fact that,
being in the Taranaki district, the people
had to milk the cows before they went to
their amusements—the small boys were not
allowed to go because they had to be up early
to bring in the beasts. Subsequently we
never sent up the curtain whilst iu the Tar-

before 9.30.

Face this fact squarely
for your wife’s sake!
Healthy men rarely consider sickness, and death only As
something far off—never an immediate possibility.
Naturally, they never bother about protecting their
dependents against such an event. This, no doubt,
accounts for the thousands of widows, who, having led
protected married lives, are left unprotected at their
husband’s death, and are now struggling against unfair
odds to earn a living.
Face this possibility squarely! No man knows
the length of his life! The act of assuring will not
lengthen or shorten life by a day, but it WILL protect
dependents against future hardships. See about it

THE SAILOR’S HORNPIPE.
American syncopated version.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Nothing violent occurred
at the chance meeting of a moderately
famous actress, her long-ago husband and
his present Avife. On the contrary, the stage
lady was angelically polite, and a night or
two later her ex-husband and his new partner
were her guests at the theatre in box seats.
I have a personal remembrance of a meeting
at a rehearsal which gave our co. a momen-
tary thrill. The central figure was Belinda
Blossom, who then called Augustus Tomato
husband, Vincent St. Blither having been
known in that character years before. Drop-
ping in unexpectedly and seeing Belinda,
Vincent approached her with an affectionate
greeting. Tomato’s eyes glittered. “Excuse
me,” he hissed, “that lady is my wife!” St.
Blither stared at him for a moment. “Oh. I
beg your pardon!” he then said, courteously.
“My mistake, sir. I thought she was mine.”
“Alastor”: Phil Walsh, who has produced
a filmed version of “John O’Brien’s” “Around
the Boree Log” (“John O’Brien” is Father
Hartigan, of Narandera, N.S.W.), is satis-
fied that there is a good market in Aus-
tralia for genuine Aussib photo-plays. Pri-
vate screenings of “Around the Boree Log”
have already resulted in bookings to the
extent of £7OOO. It is a seven-reel film with
dinkum Australian characters and plenty of
that N.S.W. mountain scenery over which
Mrs. Coontz, the American Admiral’s lady,
went into raptures when she caught sight
of it.
“Hamfat”: The conversation was about a
certain star, and somebody remarked: “It
was when she was playing “The Diapbo-
nous Diaphragm” with her husband, Raoul
Rampton, playing Paul Piffle, that” ——
“Pardon me,” interrupted the man who
knows all old theatrical history, “you
are making a mistake. She played that pieco
on her third trip; Raoul Rampton Avas her
husband on her second visit.” As most of
us kneAv the lady’s penchant for husbands,
avc let the correction stand.
“Sammas”: At the screening of “The Sea
HaAvk” in our Perth suburb the orchestra
rendered excerpts from “Pirates of Pen-
zance” throughout. The music was fairly
appropriate until the galley-slaves Avere
lashed by their crool taskmaster; then the
musicians struck up “A Policeman’s Lot is
Not a Happy One.” It recalled a picture in
Avhich the villain was getting his deserts at
the gallows. While the chaplain was gri-
macing the string band played “Honey Boy,
I Hate to See You Leaving”; and as Ketch
adjusted the rope the chune was changed to
“Won’t You Buy My Pretty Flowers?”
“Simla”: “C.K.” (B. 9/7/’25) recalls an
incident which is evergreen in my memory.
A first-night revival of a Gilbert and Sulli-
van opera which had not been heard for
five years, a packed theatre, the “House-full”
notice displayed long before 8 o'clock, and —
a principal performer missing. Chaos reigned
behind the scenes. Henry Bracey, frantic
with anxiety, appealed to Howard Vernon
for inspiration. “Cut the scene, tell Caron
[the conductor]', and go on to the finale,”
said Vernon. Flo Young was on the stage
at the time, but she finished her speech and
made her exit without turning a hair. After-
wards she told me she was dreadfully scared
by the commotion in the wings, imagining
that the theatre was on fire. Hunter, a
man well versed in G. and S. operas, hur-
riedly dressed in the clothes of the actor who
had taken the wrong turning, while the
chorus sang and the comedian joked. Up to
that time the entrance of artists into- the
theatre had been but casually noticed by the
stage-doorkeeper, but a check of the roll-
book in every J.C.W. playhouse has been
strictly enforced ever since.
“Gan”: In a world of change music-hall
humor is almost changeless. The French
have only one joke knows what
that is), and the English are satisfied with
mothers-in-law. policemen, sausages, the
wife’s cold feet, drunks and a few other
hardy annuals. Max Beerbohm once de-
voted an essay to the subject of popular
humor, . and G. K. Chesterton jumped
on him " for his superior attitude. Accord-
ing to the stout sage, people are
moved to laughter only by elemental and
eternal things, such as a politician slipping
on a banana-skin (an aspiring being brought
down to earth) or a piece of mature cheese
(the relationship between animate and in-
animate life). Perhaps Chesterton wasn’t
joking that time.
“F.T.K.” finishes what he began”:—
“AV.E.F.’s” defence of Duncan Macdougall not-
withstanding (B. 9/7/’25), I adhere to my opinion
that the little Scot is overdoing it in always
casting himself for star parts. In “Masses and
Man” Sonia is the one character that matters.
Duncan was Sonia in the Sydney Playbox production.
In “The Adding Machine.” Zero—an automaton and
not a cipher, as “AV.E.F.” has it—collects all the
kudos. Mac was Zero. In “Morality,” Dr. Brewer
and the courtesan are the leading figures, but whereas
the lady of slippery kerbstone morality is only on
in one act, Dr. Brewer is on in every scene. Duncan
“effaces” himself by playing Brewer. In “The Push-
cart Vendor” the little Caledonian was that perse-
cuted French coster; and in “R.U.R.,” though he
certainly abstained from playing either Radius or
Dr. Sail, he cast himself for Harry Domain (a
r6le for which Arthur Reardon would have been
much better suited), and, after Harry dropped out,
came on to collect the “hands” as the Robot Avho
finds his soul in the last act. An odd example of
“self-effacement.”
“Hamfat” : The Repertory movement has ex-
tended to Geelong. A visit of J. Beresford
FoAvler Avith the “Doll’s House” production
Avliich he put on in Melbourne went so well
that Geelong decided it could do with
more Repertory productions, and a Reper-
tory Club was the result. In about ten
Aveeks the club expects to stage its first
show, with Beresford Fowler’s assistance;
“Chains,” v T ery likely.
“R.K.D.N.”: Repertory societies generally
are loud in their condemnation of the star
system (B. 2/7/'25), but do not practise
what they preach. As they produce nothing
but “masterpieces,” for Avhich the “commer-
cial” managers have no use, it is their busi-
ness to give the masterpieces masterly treat-
ment. Some of the really splendid pieces
that have fallen into the hands of Repertory
producers of late could not have been acted
worse by professional mummers. What with
the bad plays that the professionals have
to interpret and the good plays being mur-
dered by amateurs, is it any wonder that
the public is staying away from the Temples
of Drama?
“Hamfat”: Mrs. Coppin (“Coot,” B.
16/7/’25) must have been going hard to play
eight characters in one piece; but old Grat-
tan Riggs sometimes exceeded that number.
I don’t remember how many changes Grattan
made in “The Irish Detective,” but as a
pie-stall owner, an undertaker and several
other people who used to reveal themselves
as the Irish “demon” in time to foil the
villain, he used to delight his audience. I
myself have been called upon to play five
parts in “The Christian”: I was a tough,
a director of Guy’s Hospital, a doctor and
a couple of other people all in one pair of
pants. And I know an old mummer who
claimed a more difficult task. With a seedy
company in Scotland, he helped to stage
“East Lynne” with four people. The two
women had a fairly easy job, but the men
who in their own selves had to be Leidson
and Archibald Carlyle were compelled to
A CASE FOR THE QUACK.
THE P.M.: “You accuse the prisoner of stealing your works
of art?"
THE ARTIST : “Yes, your Worship. He”
P.M.: “Remanded for medical observation.”
cut up Justice Hare, Richard Hare, Lord
Mount Severn, P.C. Bullock and the rest
between them. They did it to the entire
satisfaction of the audience; and as there
was £1 17s. B£d. in the house they were
satisfied themselves.
An interesting stage couple:—
Henry A. Lytton (B. 16/7/’26) and his wife, under
their own name of Henri, commenced their theatrical
careers in the chorus of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera
co. touring the English “smalls.” Fearing that
the married state was not conducive to professional
advancement, the youngsters (they were in their
’teens) travelled as brother and sister. One day
they were talking about the cheapness of their
lodgings. “Only that,” said a friend, “for a sitting-
room and two bedrooms!” “One bedroom!” cor-
rected Harry, so their little fiction had to be dropped.
Eater, when the clever young actor was required in
London to rehearse Robin Oakapple (“Ruddigore”)
for tour, W. S. Gilbert christened him Lytton, as
he did not like the French name on the bill.
Henri was quite agreeable, and has always been
proud of the fact that W.S.G. was his theatrical
godfather. Lytton was very good in the Grossmith
parts (Jack Point, Koko, etc.), and in London, when
Walter Passmore played the Jester, he was excellent
as Shadbolt. Also in the 1898 revival of “The Gon-
doliers,” when Billy Elton (once very popular in
Australia), was cast for Plaza Toro, Lytton, being
almost as good a baritone vocalist as he was a
comedian and dancer, played Giuseppe; his wife,
who retains her own name of Louie Henri, being
Tessa. Since then he has engineered a number of
successful revivals in London, and is a prominent
member of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society.
“Lond”: A strong protest is being made
in London against the constant revival by
alleged highbrow stage societies of all the
most unpleasant seventeenth-century plays
of the Restoration period. The move-
ment was started mostly by R.G.’s and the
Referee. It has spread to the Play Pic-
torial, the Daily Express and other
papers, and the Bishop of London. And it
has the blessing of the Theatrical Managers’
Association, which further suggests that
modern offensive studies of “Cocktail Connies
and Cocaine Carries” might be banned as
well as the bad old stuff.
“C. Ockney”: An English novelist, May
Edginton, is part-author of “Secrets,” now
being staged in Melbourne, and was con-
cerned with the writing of the “book” of
“No, No, Nanette,” also in the Melbourne
bills. The latter piece is an adaptation of
the lady|s comedy, “His Lady Friends.”
which was originally done in London by
Charles Hawtrey and later on in Australia
by Joseph Coyne.
“Lysander”: Not many years need pass
to turn a thrilling “situation” in stagecraft
into a squib. It was in 1921 that Clemence
Dane’s “Bill of Divorcement” set Puritan
teeth gnashing and the Nonconformist Con-
science ou edge. (It had the same effect on
Melbourne Age last week when Melbourne
Repertory Society staged the play, but that
does not affect the argument—the Age is the
Age, and custom cannot stale its infinite re-
spectability !) The modern views on love,
eugenics and divorce ethics put into the
mouth of near-flapper Sydney Fairfield pro-
vided the reason. The simple soul of Sydney
of 1921 was staunch in shunning matrimony
for conscience sake, and out of thought for
possible children who would inherit her con-
genital tendency to insanity. Thud was revo-
lutionary in 1921. The Sydneys of 1925
wouldn’t Avorry. Insanity as a ground for
divorce is now a law of the land, and the
bride-to-be’s concern is not whether her chil-
dren will inherit embarrassing lesions, but
whether she proposes to have children at all.
An author is put to it most devilishly to
write these days a masterpiece that will live
beyond next session of Parliament or the
publication of Dr. Stopes’s next book.
“X.N.0.”: Can I claim to have taken part
in the Furthest North theatrical performance?
Scapa Flow lies somewhere about latitude
59dcg. north, and a good many home-made
shows were produced
on board Grand
Fleet ships there
while we were wait-
ing for Fritz. Real-
ising that the writ-
ing and producing
of plays by officers
and men was a use-
ful way of filling in
time, the Admiralty
had the main deck
of the Fleet auxili-
ary, the s.s. Ghurko,
fitted up with a
stage, special light-
ing and seats. One
of the plays pro-
duced was called
“Squeeze That
Lemon”; the plot
was the conception
of an Irishman,
Fitzgerald by name,
and “X.N.0.” was
responsible for put-
ting the first and
third acts into verse.
Unfortunately for
my reputation as a
jingler, our skipper
insisted on taking a hand in the operation,
and interpolated such rhymes as “escape”
and “relate.” They had to stand, unfortu-
nately: captains of battleships must be de-
ferred to by junior officers even when writing
verse.
“Lud”: Two Oscars have a good deal to
do with a new musical play put on at Lon-
don Daly’s. The novelty is called “Cleo-
patra,” but has nothing in common with the
pieces on the same subject written by Shak-
speare and Bernard Shaw. Oscar Straus
supplied the harmless necessary score, and
Oscar Asche “produced.” Both are highly
commended for their work.
“C. Ockney”: Mussolini, the Italian dic-
tator, is, in his spare time, dictating a play
to his stenographer, which will ere long be
done in America with the Italo-American
actress, Maria Bazzi, in the lead. The piece
is a three-act dramatic romance called
“Gentlemen. It Begins,” and its author
started writing it 15 years ago. The signor
is not the only present-day statesman-play-
wright. England has one in Patrick Hast-
ings, K.C., Attorney-General in the short-
lived Ramsay Macdonald Government. He
is the author of a recently produced drama.
“The River,” at London St. James’.
“Peter Pannikin”: I noticed, when tour
ing the smalls, that large numbers of the
yokels designate all classes of theatrical
entertainment by the one term —“panto-
mime”—regardless of whether the show is
Shakspeare or “East Lynne.” “I’m coming
to see your ‘pantomine’ to-night,” the pride
of the village will tell you. When Allan
Wilkie w r as leaving Broken Hill, arriving at
the station at the last minute, he was held
up for his ticket, the tickets for the whole
company being in the care of the business-
manager. The station-master’s deputy, notic-
ing the big actor’s gesticulations, shouted
from the far end of the platform : “It’s all
right; pantomime—let him through.”
“Hamfat”: An actor once showed me a
dramatic version of “Nicholas Nickleby” and
it read very well. He had interested a
backer in a scheme for putting on a Dickens
cycle with himself in such parts as Ralph
Nickleby, Mark Tapley, Micawber, Dick
Swiveller and Sam Weller, his idea being
that lovei's of the novels would support the
venture in multitudes. Unfortunately the
backer got cold feet, and the actor-r resumed
his travels with “Robbery Under Arms,”
“The Kelly Gang” and “East Lynne”-—the
good old stuff that spells safety.

No effort
to lift a heavy car
with the
Weed Chain Jack
Just a few pulls on the chain of the
Weed Chain Jack while you stand
erect -away from springs and other
projections, and the work is done.
No crouching in a cramped position,
no groveling in mud and grease. So
simple that a child can operate it. To
lower, pull chain in opposite di-
rection.
The Weed Chain Jack never gets
out of order. Quickly adjusted to
any height. Be sure to have it along
for that unforeseen emergency.
Weed Chain jacks can also be sup-
plied with extension handle which
allows you to place the jack under
the car with greater ease.
At good dealers everywhere.
Made by the makers of Weed De
Luxe Tyre Chains.

ORIGINAL AMERICAN
Bruah
Reaches Every Part of Every Tooth
SCIENCE has created a brush that is designed and made so
that it reaches and thoroughly cleans every part of every
tooth, as well as the gums, every time. That brush is the Pro-
phy-lac-tic.
The curved surface of the Pro-phy-lac-tic is made to fit the
mouth, making it easy to brush all around the teeth. The saw-
tooth bristle tufts reach in between the teeth. The large end
tuft cleans the backs of front teeth and the backs of the hard-
to-reach molars. Not a part of any tooth is left untouched.
No other brush cleans as thoroughly as the Pro-phy-lac-tic.
Made in three sizes: Adult, Small and Baby, in medium, soft and
hard bristles. Always sold in the yellow box. Look for the fac-simile
hyphenated name on both box and brush handle.

DRAWING IS PROFITABLE
The Weston method of
teaching drawing by post
is the most successful, be-
cause Mr. Weston teaches
his students to DRAW, not
to copy.
Many Weston pupils earn
money before they complete
the course, whilst several
successful Australian artists
owe their first training to
the Weston School.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
E.B. J.: Faint pencil never won fair per-
usal. .. .Eric T.: Shocking rubbish that has no remote
connection with reality... .M.G.W.: The wretched
yam stumbles about drunkenly without making its
meaning clear.... J.A.H.: “Those Pioneers” fail to
move us. They were a pretty tame lot if they
couldn’t muddle things better than that... .R.J.L.:
Not very fresh in idea and rather labored... .L.8.F.:
Harriet makes only a very thin and obvious yarn.
Walter M.: The ideas are very slight and the
verse js poor. “Toddling/’ as a rhyme for “goblin,”
is cruel A.R.R.: Awful verse. You .can't steal
another man’s well-known pen-name... .Caesar: Can’t
answer your question why you don’t “burst into
song,” but the fact that you don't is pretty
obvious.... Elman: Not bad verse, but it is only
a preface to something which doesn’t arrive....
C.A.T.: Moves feebly in an attempt to clown in
an ancient and tiresome way....1.H.: You
say you have “written a poem.” We should
call the screed by a less lofty name. It
isn’t prose and it isn’t verse, but it is pretty stupid.
....Popple: Doesn’t get anywhere near G.Mc.:
It couldn’t be much feebler.... Grace L.: It is ail
very young and crude... .C.F.J.: The bombardment
of the Fleet is likely to be a heavy one, but a few
blasts like yours should give It a bad shaking....
M.G. (Bendigo) : The thrilling sporting item deserves
a place:—
A bushman tall with a 303
A slip on the rocks and a great d
A staghound weak
With his side ripped through
Done an hour back
By an old man ’roo
A wild dog nest
’Neath a fur-tree scrub
A dingo fierce
And her mate and cub
A rush from the dog
And an anguished cry
With the wild dogs fast
On neck and thigh
Two shots rang out
And the gun spoke true
And two scalps in his belt
In the wild Paroo.
... .A.R.A.: The old sailor is about as interesting
as an aged turnip... .Peter F.: Falls all over its
own feet. You don’t seem to have any real idea
what you are trying to d 0... .C.O’M.: Misses, but
not by many miles... .A.R.L.: That yarn of the
returned cat has been working overtime for many
years. For shame’s sake bury the beast with some
disinfectant and have done with it....8.C. (Manly):
Doesn’t strike us L.0.W.: There have been worse
first attempts, also better... .Lucy R.: Read some
decent verse and try to find out what it is... .W.J.S.:
Don’t get the idea that you have written a sonnet
when you have chopped 14 lines to the required
length and put the rhymes in the right places
S.S.M.: Too weak and thin Onyx: It flops into
utter feebleness 8.A.N.: The idea was all right,
but the handling is terrible... .J.L.R.: The bull
yarn is a bit confused and the verse that carries it
is terrifying.... J.C. (Homewood) : Dreary, pointless
fooling E.J.G.: Suitable for writing in a lady’s
album —that is if the lady is not too particular
Ripponlea: We publish it as a warning to everybody:
A BEAUTIFUL REUNION.
Did the American sailor
Steal into a pub,
As his mouth with th’ back
Of his hand did he rub.
With tears in his eyes
He gaped around,
For his brain couldn’t grasp
The old familiar sounds.
His hands were trembling;
His head it did spin.
With a wan, wistful smile,
He said, “Guy, gimme a gin.”
He grasped it with fever;
His throat felt like brass,
His elbow did lever
As he gulped at th’ glass.
They tried to restrain him,
Persuade him to sip it;
But he clutched at it fiercely,
And down did he tip it.
The gin didn’t touch
Th’ sides as it sped;
But th’ shock was too much,
And he fell down dead.
....D.R.M.: We read on and on hoping to come to
some sort of point, but the thing merely lost itself
in a slither of commonplace words... .R.L.D.: The
verse is very weak and says nothing that has not
been said better a thousand times before L.L.
(Katoomba): Its chief feature is the lack of know-
ledge of the subject displayed... .G.H.P.: The yarn
is horrible without being credible Wm. D.: You
don’t contrive to make it anything like convincing.
Jessie R.: Weak little flutter towards the basket.
A.H.F.: You say you have “avoided rhymes as
bad art.” Most people who avoid rhymes do so
because they can’t find them. But why avoid metre,
grammar and commonsense also? K.H.S.: You
waste a lot of good space trying to get a perfectly
unnecessary person started telling the yarn; and
when he does get going he has n > yarn to tell
J.G.S.: Stiff with dreary commonplaces Augustus
VY.: A poem in all but the making:—
Where ever I live, where ever I roam
Where ever I sleep there is my home
Sometimes under a tree, sometimes a cave
That is the sort of home, my fate me gave.
My home are the Trees on the River bank,
The Water like Wine so often I drank.
When I wander from plase to plase.
Some cruel hardship I have to fase,
I carry my swag through Sunshine and Ram
Searching for happiness, but all in Vain
My friends are the Birds the sing to me
Amongst flowers under a shady Tree.
Times are fleeting, old age is creeping
Many sad broken hearts are sleeping
Under the grass and flowers in the spring
Under shady Trees where the Birds sing
Now I think of my Youth, far, far away
I wished I had known, what I know to-day.
D.O.C.: The woman with “insectivorous locks”
is a bit of a novelty... .L.M.H.: Hardly worth ill
that space W.E.8.: The “Bargain” doesn’t con-
vince.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
S.D.P.: If Australian squires exist, we refuse to
recognise the fact... .Andrews: Doesn’t quite ring
the bell M.S.: Too many lines and too little
drawing. Also the jokes are either ancient jokes or
not properly jokes at a11....L.R.: The quip is old,
the criminals don’t convince, and the addition of a
badly-drawn feline doesn’t improve matters
J.C.L.L.; Beyond our comprehension... .T.C.: It’s no
laughing matter... .W.G.: A slender talent that can
stand a lot of fattening... .L.R.: Human beings are
beyond you. Try illustrating a conversation between
a saucepan and a sausage... .0.M.G.: Nothing in it.
L.McC.: It has virtues as an illustration, but
not as a humorous drawing.

“Clerk”: The first “Mikado” type of loco-
motive in Australia, having just earned the
approval of Vic. railway mechanical engi-
neer A. E. Smith, has now been placed in
running. The engine was designed and built
by Victorians; and Clapp, with an eye for
the future, ordered that it be so constructed
as to be readily adaptable to a 4ft. B£in.
gauge, if necessary. Nine additional engines
of the same type are to be constructed at
Njtewport.

“Bill Bowyang”: The last pearling season
in the Trobriand waters, off the Papuan
coast, was the most successful for years; one
well-known dealer is said to have purchased
from the natives gems to tbe value of
£2Q(000. Most of the lapi shell containing
pearls was found in shallow water near
Vakuta and Kiriwina. The law does not
allow other than natives to dive for shell,
;yn<l the pearls are sold to traders who pay
£5O a year for a license.

“Paradise”: He comes regularly to me
every quarter for two weeks’ work. I place
two unemployed-insurance stamps at 3d. each
in my wages-book, and two more upon his
card. He takes his card, representing one
shilling revenue to the Government, and re-
gisters “out of work.” This entitles him to
15 weeks’ unemployed pay at 15s. and family
allowances as well, c.g., 15s. to himself, 15s.
to his wife and ss. for his son and heir.
This is the latest in Queensland State in-
dustries ; Is. judiciously invested to produce
355. per week.

“Uramao”: The celebration of the half-
century of the U.S.S. Co. revives memories
of the early steamers that spluttered round
Maoriland’s coast. The first was the Gover-
nor Wynyard, a paddle-steamer, built in
M.L., that traded between Auckland and
Tamaki in the early ’fifties. In the late
’fifties the N.Z. Steam Navigation Co. of
Wellington purchased the Wonga-Wonga
(200 tons) in Australia. Captain Renner
took command-of her when she arrived. Next,
the Stormbird was added under Capt. Ken-
nedy, who later became Commodore of the
U.S.S. fleet. The third accession was the
Ladybird, a three-mast schooner converted
into a steamer. The co. met with rough
financial weather later, and sank; its fleet
was dispersed, and the infant U.S.S. Co.
acquired the three vessels mentioned.
* * * *
“ J.11.D.”: All the ad. men aren’t in the
cities. At Nagambie (Vic.),a Goulburn Valley
hamlet, some years ago, Greenwood, one of
the town’s two blacksmiths, put up this
notice on a gum-tree in front of the sale-
yards : “Go to Greenwood for first-class shoe-
ing.” When sale day came round the cockies
spied the sign, and twitted Paddy Nolan,
the other blacksmith, about it. Paddy went
to his forge, got a piece of tin, and painted
on it: “If Paddy Nolan is not home.” Be-
fore the sale was over his slogan was nailed
above Greenwood’s.
* * * *
“Alwyn”: The long baize-topped table on
which N.S.W. Income-tax Commissioner
Whiddon’s professional shekel-gatherers gar-
ner the daily harvest is a stout piece of
mahogany with a history; it was used by the
first N.S.W. Executive Council. The Taxa-
tion authorities obtained it from the Colonial
Secretary’s office nearly 30 years ago.
* * * *
“Stratton”: The canning of meats is far
from being a modern discovery. Captain
Philip King, R.N., in his “Narrative of a
Survey of the Inter-Tropical and Western
Coasts of Australia,” quotes this paragraph
from his journal while he was on the nor’-
western coast, near Cape Bougainville, on
September 20, 1820 :
A steep peaked hill near our landing-place was
named Donkin’s Hill, after the inventor of the
preserved meats; upon a canister of which our party
dined. This invention is now so generally known
that its merits do not require to be recorded here;
we had lately used a case that was preserved m
1814, which was equally good with some that had
been packed up in 1818. This was the first time
it had been employed upon our boat excursions, and
the result fully answered every expectation, as it
prevented that excessive and distressing thirst from
which in all other previous expeditions we had
suffered very much.
* * * *
“X2X”: Worse than the arrack of Meso-
potamia or the mescal of Mexico is the sam-
shui which the Chinaman makes from rice
and other things. Rice, unlike most other
alcohol-yielding substances, does not require
the process of dialysis, or the addition of
yeast, to start it off in a tropical country,
as it contains a characteristic ferment of its
own. This produces chemical bodies, apart
from the alcohol, which give it added “kick.”
Some years ago a gang of Sydney wharf-
laborers, working in the hold of a China
ship, broached a case of samshui and con-
sumed about three-quarters of a pint each.
Though they were hardened to beer, all had
to be treated at the hospital, and even then
the stomach-pump, plus the usual remedies,
failed to restore some of them for several
hours. Some of the chemical bodies which
do the damage have a pharmacological action
not unlike that of certain narcotics, and pos-
sibly the fact that the average Celestial can
drink a great deal of the stuff is due to his
habit of opium-smoking.
* * * *
“Sturt”: Professor Cleland, of Adelaide
Uni., has given the S.A. Government an in-
terim report on complaints from wood-
workers about the ill-effects of handling red
pine or blackwood. The last-named seems to
cause eczema, but only in rare instances:
both cause asthma occasionally, and medical
knowledge suggests no remedy except letting
any man shown to be susceptible avoid the
stuff. The inhaling of sawdust is a different
matter, being almost universal, with blue
gum, red pine and rimu probably the most
irritating. The Professor reports that the
tickling cough passes away with a week-end’s
rest, and seems to have no ill effect on the
lungs; but he recommends proper exhausts
for carrying off the fine wood-dust as a pre-
ventive ; they are being installed in some fac-
tories, and should be made universal.

of J. C. Williamson's Grand Op.era Company, now appearing at
the Ambassadors, writes: “I am a user of Rexona Soap and
find it unequalled for keeping the skin and hair in perfect
condition."
Be a Rexona Girl!
It Means Health
and Beauty.
Rexona and Rexona Soap are the Rexona Girl’s
aids to beauty. With their assistance she rids her
skin of blemishes and pimples, keeps her hair and
scalp in such perfect condition that she is the envy
of all her friends. The Rexona Girl is not selfish
—she does not keep the secret to herself, but wishes
all the world to rejoice with her. Over 5000 girls
have written to the Company the glad news that
they are Rexona Girls and find the Rexona Products
the most wonderful aids to health and beauty.
They say that Rexona Soap keeps their skin and
hair healthy and beautiful, and should be used by
every girl who values her good looks. They say
they are always finding new uses for Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, and many of their letters contain a
photograph which shows by its beauty that these
users are getting the best results in health and happi-
ness. Are you satisfied with your looks? Why not
become a Rexona Girl and use only Rexona and
Rexona Soap, too?

Following on tlie successful use of aero-
planes in eliminating boll-weevil from cotton-
crops by means of clouds of calcium arsenate
shaken from the sky, Uncle Sam’s Depart-
ment of Agriculture proposes to employ the
same method in fighting the malarial mos-
quito, which has turned vast areas of the
Southern States into a no-man's land. Ex-
periments on a small section of larvse-
breeding swamp have already been made, and
have turned out satisfactorily enough to
justify further operations.
The Government in N. S. Wales is going,
in its mind’s eye, to expedite the Sydney city
railway, lest the harbor bridge, which is a
contract job and started 10 years later, should
be completed first. The railway was recom-
mended by a royal commission in 1909. It
got under way, and when the war made bor-
rowing difficult (early in 1915) it was in-
cluded in the famous Norton Griffiths con-
tract, by which the firm was* to build rail-
ways and be paid by a percentage on the cost,
so the higher the cost the better for the firm.
Holman’s Government saw the point at last,
and bought its capitalists out. Nine Pre-
miers have wrestled with the little bit of
line—McGowen, two Holmans (one Labor
and one mixed), a Storey, two Dooleys, two
Fullers and a Lang; and there is a rumor
that the first mile or so of it will open one
of these days.
“Sou’-East”: Beachport, in the south-east
of S.A., is between the Devil and deep sea.
The shifting sandhills, threatening to engulf
the town on the one side, are the Devil;
meanwhile the sea on the other side is rapidly
eating into the land. Sheet piling along
the water-front and marram grass behind are
urgently needed, but procrastination and in-
decision have the job in hand. The sand is
already creeping over the back fences, while
the liarbor-master’s house threatens to dis-
appear beneath the waves.
“Centurion” counters:—
“Cartoit” errs in attempting to correct my
remarks on the duties of mediaeval execu-
tioners (B. 2/7/’2o). He refers to the “ordeal
by water” as a “punishment” and states that it de-
manded extreme skill on the part of the practitioner.
Nothing could be more incorrect. Like all forms of
tlie Middle Justice, the “ordeal” was not a punish-
ment, but a rather emphatic equivalent to our
modern cross-examination. It was chiefly used in
France, and as French law allowed a tortured person
to sue his judges if he were proved innocent, strict
formalities were observed. For the “ordinary” ordeal
the victim, stretched over a trestle 21ft. high, had
four jars of water, each containing two pints,
poured down his throat. For the “extraordinary”
the trestle was replaced by one a foot higher, and
four more jars were administered, no more and no
less. M. Jousse, an eminent jurist of the seven-
teenth century, set out the methods to be observed
in a standard treatise on the French criminal law of
his day, from which the above particulars have been
extracted. The Marquise de Brenvilliers was so little
injured by her four gallons that she was able to
make the amende honorable outside Notre Dame the
same evening in a white shift, and then, after ascend-
ing the scaffold, to wait nearly an hour, standing,
before the executioner’s sword ended her earthly
troubles.
“Sixenate”: New breach-of-prornise dan-
gers lurk in the use of modern idiom. A
Melbourne Percival who had been philander-
ing with no serious intentions sent the lady
a note: “If I can see you to-morrow I will
give you a ring.” Percival knew it had
reference to a telephone call; but he was
advised that so much might be made of it, in
conjunction with sundry canoodlings, that
he had better pay up and look pleasant. He
did the one and tried to do the other.
“Hamer” : The conquest of the world by
the adventurous motorist goes on apace. The
last exploit has been the traversing of Africa
from north to south by a French officer, one
Captain Delingette. He drove his car, shod with
balloon tyres, from Algiers across the Sahara
and down by way of Victoria Falls and
Buluwayo to Cape Town. Then he started
on the return trip through East Africa and
Khartoum. And he didn’t altogether startle
the natives. Whilst on the way across the
Sahara he struck a company of travellers
moving in the usual caravan style, but in
the procession was an old and very unkempt
Ford, the property of a sheik with progres-
sive ideas.
“Sehnorrer”: Percy J. Marks, an autho-
rity upon .Jewish histox*y in Australia, re-
cently gave some information to the Austra-
lian Historical Society on the early history
of the Jews in Australia. The first Syna-
gogue was established in Sydney in 1831,' but
there had been services, or “Minyons,” held
before that. The building converted for the
purpose having long disappeared, details
about it are indefinite. In 1837 a building
at No. 4 Bridge-street was acquired and be-
came a synagogue. It was built upon the
original grant made to Lieutenant William
Kent, who erected a substantial home and
offices upon it. These, with a considerable
portion of the grant, comprising 2 acres 17
perches, were purchased by Governor King
in 1800 for Australia’s first orphan asylum
and school, the sum paid being £1539 17s.
3d. In a subdivision in 1827 lot 3, with a
building erected in 1810, was purchased by
John Tawell. That building became the
Synagogue in the ’thirties, and remained the
meeting-place of the Chosen until the York-
street synagogue w r as built in 1844. The
building was then deconsecrated, and put to
other uses, but it was built so substantially
that it was 103 years old when demolished in
1913 to make room for the present tall block
of buildings.
“Wallaby”: He looked to me like the
twin brother of that ferocious, bushy-eye-
browed, massive giant who once supplied the
target for Charlie Chaplin’s well-directed
custard-tarts. Little wonder, then, that as
he thumped into his seat and glared around
the compartment I tightened my grip on my
umbrella and sank full back into the cushions
—screened, I hoped, by Bloggs’s portly figure.
Bloggs, however, to my utter astonishment,
addressed a word of greeting to the levia-
than and received a sonorous grunt in re-
turn before Orson spread open and retired
into his newspaper. It was not until we had
reached our destination, and the awesome
stranger had departed, that I dared so L
enlightenment. “Who?” said Bloggs. “Oh,
that was Freddy Fairchild—runs the lingerie
department in Gay and Nuckley’s!”

Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
Of all the new discoveries in medical science the most remark-
able of recent years is one which has proved invaluable to
thousands of people and which is rapidly taking the place of
all other remedies for the relief of coughs and colds. This
preparation is called Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for Coughs
and Colds, and is a scientific compound of great merit. It is
most healing to the lungs and throat and stops the cough or
cold in a remarkably short time, leaving no bad after-effects.
A few doses of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery taken when a
cold is coming on are generally all that is needed to soothe the
fever and correct the bodily discomfort of a severe cold. It is
well to continue taking New Discovery for a day or two, even
after the attack seems averted, for its soothing influence on the
mucous membrane renders one less liable to a second attack.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for Coughs and Colds is a universal
favorite with men, women and children. So universal has become
the use of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery that it can now be readily
obtained from over 25,000 Chemists and Stores in Australasia. Its
immense sale is a substantial proof of its merit and popularity.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
ONE morn in Egypt and a thousand
here
Have I beheld upon the arclifed skies
This tender blue that deepens in thine eyes,
Beneath the crystal of their saltless tear;
So soft 1 thought God’s eyes seemed very
near,
That they would teach me all, would make
me wise;
And then Day touched his dome with
darker dyes,
And all the harvest that I had was fear.
But oli, those eyes seemed sweetly innocent!
Aye, even as thine own, my tender son!
And all these things, law’s, lusts, men blame
on God
They seemed to say His children did invent:
And, peering thus on what He had begun,
God fashioned thee, and threw away His rod.
11.
Near, nearer come, and live within my heart,
That 1 may know again forgotten hours,
And learn to laugh at all this fear that
lours
And all this bitterness of Sorrow’s smart;
That I might walk with thee that greater
part
Of God’s dominion where the fragrant
flow’rs
Of Love and Truth and Beauty cup their
show’rs,
Above the taint of this unhallowed mart.
Dear son, wdiose tender bud must know the
frost
That too, too certain waits the hour to be
And bites ere yet the petals are unfurl’d,
Oh, help me find again what I have lost
Among the weeds of earthly vanity,
And lusts and longings of this lonely world.
111.
Come, take my hand, and to yon fragrant
mound
These footsteps, young again, lead on and
on,
And there together shall we gaze upon
The azure walls that this fair earth sur-
round :
There taste the scented air, watch Heaven
gowned
In all the robes one hour may see her don ;
You visioning what is, I all that’s gone;
And listening both whilst God’s deep drums
resound.
All, cheating Thought, that blindfold thus
would turn
Old Hope to foolish gropings for the skies
That smile on none but Youth’s uncharted
streams!
Alas, one thing, the greatest that I yearn,
This gulf of years too steadfastly denies —
Dear child, I cannot know nor share thy
dreams.

CECIL MANN.
Ambition.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A BITTER wind, rainsoaked and chilling,
whined across the lucerne fields in
the Peel River valley; and at each
blast of the gale the windows of the little
farmhouse on the hill rattled like dried
bones. An ancient bracket-lamp dimly
lighted the kitchen where Mrs. Carey bent
over the sink, pursuing her perennial drud-
gery in an atmosphere of burning wood and
stale cabbage-water. Her task completed,
she prodded the fire into greater activity, and
sat awhile in its warmth, drawing the chair
closer as an unusually sharp squall sent a
freezing draught down the wide chimney. In
the momentary lull that followed she listened
disgustedly to the snores and grunts that pro-
ceeded from the front room, where her hus-
band had been slumbering for the better
part of an hour. Rebellion flamed up in the
harassed soul of Mrs. Carey, and she swept
a contemptuous glance at her surroundings.
“Gawd, wot a life!” she muttered, smooth-
ing a recalcitrant wisp of hair from her
forehead. “Washin’, sweepin’, cookin’ an’
churnin’, with only ’im ter talk ter. Even
’is ’orses gits a spell ’ere an’ there, an’ ’e’s
more perticler about ’is pigs than ’e is about
me,” she told herself, as her ears were
assailed by a series of reverberating snorts
and gasps from her sleeping lord. “It’s a
wonder I don’t go mad. P’r’aps I will soon,
if somethin’ don’t ’appen.”
Married at eighteen, life had been a bitter
experience for the haggard little woman. It
had been one ceaseless struggle since Father
Callaghan had blessed her union with Tim
Carey thirty years before. Inexorably the
tides of time had swept away her early
romanticisms, and carried her far beyond
reach of the happiness she craved. She
hated life, and would have given it up were
it not for the tousled-haired boy who slept
so peacefully in the adjoining room. He
was the one ray of comfort in her drab world
—her only companion and hope.
Not even the vicissitudes of marital slavery
had dimmed the lustre of her plans for his
future. From the day of his birth she had
nourished an ambition that he should become
a power in the world of affairs, for it was un-
thinkable that he should ever mature into
such an uncouth, porcine creature as her
husband. There were obvious difficulties in
her path, but they merely served to strengthen
her determination. She must succeed, de-
spite the atmosphere in which she had to
bring up her child, her last baby, now twelve
years old. Her other youngsters, all boys,
were dead. Twice the fruit of her body had
crossed the river, consigned to the little
cemetery at the foot of the ranges. Some-
where beneath the -waving poppies in Flan-
ders a third lad was at rest. And now there
was only one left. She and Carey had had
no education to speak of. They had married
young, and in the interminable battle with
the elements they had no time to waste on
anything that was not essential to their
mechanical existence. But their son—so
much hers and so little his—was to be
different.
Although Carey knew nothing of his wife’s
ambitions in this direction, it would soon be
necessary for him to be told. The boy was
progressing well at the Tamworth district
school, and the periodical reports that found
their way to the bleak farmhouse spoke in
glowing terms of his diligence and aptitude.
He was one of the most promising boys in
his class and, so his mother judged, eminently
fitted for further education that would enable
him to take his place in life as a doctor or
lawyer, such as she sometimes read about in
the weekly papers. In her scheme of things
he would eventually leave the district school,
go to the high school, and thence to college in
Sydney, where his mental equipment would
receive its final burnishing. Yes, Carey must
be told without further delay; education was
an expensive luxury, and they must begin
saving immediately.
Winding the clock, and taking the lamp
with her, Mrs. Carey headed for the bedroom.
For a moment she had a notion to wake her
husband and tell him there and then; but
while she hesitated her courage failed her,
and she decided to postpone the matter until
next morning. Long afterwards, while still
rehearsing suitable arguments, she fell asleep.
Before daybreak she woke with a start,
and felt the room fiercely -cold. She climbed
out of bed, found the matches and saw that
it was nearly half-past four—time for the
daily routine to commence. She dressed
with numbed fingers, took down the bracket-
lamp from the mantel-shelf, and repaired to
the cold, cheerless kitchen, which was still
heavy with the odors of the night before.
Habitually her thoughts returned to her
little boy, who was still sleeping peacefully
in the room without.
“ ’E ain’t goin’ ter stop ’ere all ’is life,”
she muttered, lighting the fire, and going
through all the motions of preparing break-
fast. “ E’d be better dead than slavin’ ’is
life away like ’is father ’as been doin’.”
The snoring in the front room had ceased,
and she could hear Carey stamping on the
cold floor like a horse. Presently he
appeared, a huge, lumbering figure, hairy
and unkempt. Scorning the wash-basin she
had filled with hot water, lie slumped into a
chair, and attacked the breakfast that was
laid out on one corner of the paper-covered
table. No words of greeting had been ex-
changed ; such courtesies were not the custom
in the Carey household. While he ate, the
woman stood by the stove and watched him.
No detail of that shaggy hair, the untidy
clothes and the beast-like table manners
escaped her. However small her knowledge
of the correct way to bring up her boy, she
was resolved that he must never grow up
like that. Pouring his tea into the saucer,
Carey guzzled it audibly; he looked up,
smacking his lips.
“Ain’t yer eatin’?” he demanded.
“I et early.” Her reply was colorless.
Without further comment, the man speared
a potato with his knife and devoured it
noisily. Something in this gastronomic dis-
play stirred Mrs. Carey out of her lethargy.
A sudden courage came to her, and she re-
solved to unburden her mind without any
preliminary explanations.
“Tim,” she said, in a low voice, “ain’t it
near time we started savin’ fer young ’Erbie
ter go ter college when ’e leaves ther district
school?” She spoke half-fearfully, not dar-
ing to look at his face. She had no fear of
physical violence at his hands, for he had
never been cruel to her in that sense; he had
merely accepted her as a kind of machine
that functioned for his own personal benefit.
“Wot’s this new foolin’?” he inquired,
regarding her in a stolid, puzzled way. “Col-
leges ain’t fer the likes of ’im. There ain’t
no room fer perfessers on this farm.”
“Yes, Tim, ’c’s goin’ ter git proper learnin’
an’ be somethin’ when ’e grows up. Yer boy
ain’t goin’ ter do wot we’ve been doin’,
strugglin’ an’ gettin’ nowhere. Better to ’ave
’im dead than that.” Her own courage sur-
prised her; it was the longest speech she had
ever made to her husband on this all-absorb-
ing topic. Carey glowered at her over the
top of his saucer.
“Don’t let me ’ear sich talk agin,” he
warned. “I never ’ad no eddication, yet
ye’re still livin’ with me after thirty years.
Ain’t I good enough fer yer? Let’s ’ave no
more of it.” His tone carried an air of
finality that effectually closed the subject.
Pushing the dishes aside, he rose from the
table, and, without a word of thanks, took
from her hands his heavy coat to which the
smells of the sty and cowbail still clung. An
instant later the back door banged behind
him with noisy significance.
Left to herself again, Mrs. Carey busied
herself about the kitchen, sternly resisting
the temptation to run out of the house and
keep on running. It was while she indulged
in a brief respite from her labors that the
great idea took shape in her mind. For a
moment it seemed so tremendous that she
almost quailed before it. She had never
cheated Carey in any way before, neither
was she conscious of ever having told him a
deliberate lie. Still, while he held the purse-
strings her ambitious plans would never
reach fruition. Something drastic had to be
done, and at last she knew how it might be
accomplished. She would steal the neces-
sary funds from him gradually! At first
sight it seemed so easy. Every week Carey's
rickety waggon was a familiar sight outside
the Tamworth markets, and it was Mrs.
Carey herself who took the produce. in for
sale. She could drive a harder bargain than
her husband, and he knew it. He depended
on her to do most of the weighing and
measuring; and heretofore he had always
exercised a careful check on the proceeds.
Still, there were ways and means of defraud-
ing him in a mild way, and she decided to
work along those lines. By making better
butter she could get higher prices without
his knowledge, and a slight manipulation of
the scales would also assist her new plans
—plans that would eventually take her boy
out of his stultifying environment, and help
to develop the type of man she could be
proud, if a little afraid, to call her son. With
this goal in view, Mrs. Carey decided that
she must stop dreaming. Stepping to the
window, she glanced out across the fields.
The rain had ceased, and a watery sun was
struggling up feebly from behind the hills.
As she watched the habitual dejection seemed
to pour out of her. and her spare frame to
expand with a sudden influx of hope. Turn-
ire she tonk up the broom and attacked
Two days later she went to the market,
almost enjoying the trip which, previously,
had been one of the most troublesome thorns

AID THE KIDNEYS.
Do Not Endanger Life when there
is a Way to Avoid It.
Why will people continue to suffer the agonies of
kidney complaint, backache, urinary disorders, lameness,
headaches, languor? Why allow themselves to become
chronic invalids when a tested remedy is offered them?
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have been used in Kidney
trouble for years, and have been tested in thousands of
cases. If you have any, even one, of the symptoms of
kidney disease, act now. Serious kidney disease may
set in and make neglect dangerous. Sydney testimony is
given here:—

A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:— “Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not wbrk. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief ; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. I am fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me, many years ago, and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”

AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says:—“For years I suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to lie up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. I
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to
me to try this remedy. I got some, and it proved a blessing,
giving quick relief, and gradually effected a perfect cure. I feel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.”

iri her crown of woe. Perhaps by that night
she would have a nucleus of the fund which
would relieve her lad’s future wife of such
a humiliating task as marketing. In the
sale-rooms she drove her bargains as she had
never driven them before,, selling everything
she had brought with her. In the grocer’s
shop afterwards she made straggling calcu-
lations in atrocious figures, holding her breath
for fear of possible mistakes; but when she
counted the money into Carey’s outstretched
hand later in the day, his surly silence told
her that she had figured correctly. She was
vaguely surprised at the success of her first
deliberate deception, but the greasy ten-
shilling note felt warm against her bosom.
Breathing a prayer of thanksgiving, she
resumed her housework with a vigor that
might have puzzled a more alert man than
her husband.
Spring came. The weekly trips to market
continued, and each trip added fresh figures
to the columns in the little bank-book that
nestled so close to her heart. The deposits
fluctuated with the seasons, but, however in-
significant, each addition to the total was an
inspiration to the wistful little mother. At
first she would not part with the book; after-
wards, however, prompted by a fear that
Carey might accidentally discover it, she
left it with the young man at the Savings
Bank.
In the passing years the boy grew steadily,
and the school reports maintained their note
of praise for his scholastic progress. Not
even the long winters that followed one
another so quickly could damp Mrs. Carey’s
spirit. She no longer felt a prisoner in
her surroundings. Carey was still there, of
course, but he had steadily passed out of her
conscioußnesls. All her soul, everything,
was for her boy, who was now 16 and in
the highest class; at the district school.
Things had not. become any easier for the
slaving little woman. When the rains came
the potatoes would sometimes rot in the
ground; and on other occasions a dry season
meant a serious diminution in the cows’
yield, which made her butter the best in
the whole district. At one period the magic
figures in the bank-book had been stationary
for nearly four months. But she never de-
spaired ; in spite of every set-back those
savings had grown astonishingly, and her
secret was still safe. One thing alone troubled
her; Herbert had entered upon his last
quarter at the local school, and each sun-
rise brought her a day nearer to the time
when Carey would have to be confronted
with the evidence of her duplicity. From
his attitude it was evident that her husband
thought her earlier ambitions had been aban-
doned, since neither he nor she had since
referred to it in any of their rare conver-
sations.
However, when the fateful day arrived
Destiny sided with the little mother, as it
sometimes does with one who fights bravely
and unselfishly. Her son returned from the
district school, winner of a bursary en-
titling him to a four years’ course at the
High School in Armidale. Overjoyed at
this providential stroke of fortune, Mrs.
Carey handled the final report card rev-
erently, and placed it behind the clock, where
she could refer to it frequently. During the
few months that followed Carey was stub-
born in his opposition to the boy’s further
education, in spite of tlie fact that it would
cost him nothing. But his wife’s new-found
determination, supplemented by the boy’s own
spirited appeals, eventually prevailed, and
life at the farmhouse resumed its mechanical
rhythm.
“You’ve ’ad yer way about th’ ’lgh
School ’’ he growled at her the day her boy
left. “But I ain’t budgin’ a inch from wot
I sed about ’im goin’ ter college, I ain't
spendin’ no more on ’im. It ain’t doctors
we want on this farm —it’s workers.”
In the four years that followed, Mrs.
Carey worked with fanatical purpose. Her
customary household duties were now sup-
plemented by long hours in the fields, and
back-breaking stretches in the potato-patch.
It was killing work, nossible only to a woman
with her child’s welfare at heart. Through
it all Carey treated her with little more re-
spect than he exhibited towards the pigs and
horses. Deprived of his son’s occasional
assistance outside school-hours, he accepted
his wife’s substitution without comment or
thanks. If he ever wondered at this turn
of events, if it ever occurred to him that
the frail little woman was grinding away
her very boul for some hidden purpose, he
gave no sign and spoke no word.
Then came a letter from her boy, and Mrs.
Carey opened it with trembling fingers. His
school-days would be ended in a week, and
he wrote with mysterious optimism. “I
have a great surprise for you,” she read,
laboriously, “and 1 know you will be pleased
when you find out what it is. You may
expect me home by the afternoon train on
Friday.” Long after Carey began snoring
regularly that night she lay awake, planning
how she would hand Herbert the bank-book
the moment he stepped inside the door. Would
he be pleased? She wondered. Perhaps he
might even kiss her again, just as he had
done as the train was about to start for
Armidale four years before. She had never
forgotten that kiss; it had thrilled her like
the kiss of a lover. Still wondering and
planning, she fell asleep.
The sun was peeping over the hills when
she woke next morning. She had over-
slept herself, and must hurry with the break-
fast. Dressing hastily, she busied herself
about the kitchen. Another day of endless
struggling took its toll of her life-strength,
and night found her in bed early, sleeping
like a child. Dreams came to her—wonder-
ful pictures of a' golden future through
which her boy moved, a commanding figure
in the world of affairs; dreams vaguely
clouded by regrets that she had never taken
the lad fully into her confidence. He knew
nothing of her hidden affection, of the long-
years during which she had quelled almost
overpowering impulses to fondle him. The
memory of that parting kiss returned, and
before its message of understanding all,
shadow fled. Mrs. Carey slept on.
Next day she journeyed to the markets,
and made her last deposit at the hank.
Demanding the pass-book, she took it rever-
ently, and bestowed a rare smile upon the
sleek young man who handed it across the
counter. Two more days, and she could
hand her son the little book which would
be liis passport to the outer world.
Friday came, a day of wonder with the
sun flooding the countryside with a dazzling-
splendorl. Standing by the window and
breathing in the air of the new day, Mrs.
Carey glanced at the cracked mirror, and
almost recoiled from what its blurred sur-
face returned to her. Not since her girl-
hood had there been such a bright light in
her eyes. With a foolish little laugh of
sheer happiness, she took up her daily cross
once more. The morning drew to a close,
and afternoon came, hot and blistering.
Three o’clock! He would be home soon.
She began tidying herself, giving her scraggy
hair little womanish touches, and, with
new-found vanity, smoothing the more
noticeable wrinkles from her skirt. Con-
scious of her shabbiness, she would have
liked to greet him with the comforting poise
and assurance that accompanies the wearing
of new clothes; but clothes were expensive,
and she had banked every possible penny.
Taking the bank-book from behind the clock
she thrust it into her blouse, and drew a
chair near the window where she could
watch the road. There it lay, shimmering
in the afternoon heat, but with no sign of
life on what she could see of its narrow,
winding course. For the fiftieth time she
read his last letter, and chuckled at his
reference to that- promised surprise. What-
ever it was she knew that it could be
nothing to the surprise she had been keep-
ing for him.
Intent upon her thoughts, Mrs. Carey did
not see a closed buggy rounding the bend,
and turning into the farm. The front door
clicked, opened. Hurriedly pushing the
letter into her blouse, she stumbled down
the passage with unaccustomed haste, and
found him standing’ on the threshold. Mrs.
Carey’s cry of welcome was strangled in
her throat, for he was not alone. Behind
him—was she seeing rightly?—stood a stout-
built. girl, with sullen eyes and bony, red
hands.
“Mother,” her son was speaking, and she
strove to listen calmly, “this is Eileen Regan.
She used to work in the sundae shop at
Armidale, and we’ve been great friends.
She has no relations in Australia, and came
here to settle down in the country. We were
married just before we left. I' thought I’d
surprise you by keeping it a secret. I’m
nearly 20 now, and the minister must have
thought II was more, because ho never
asked my age. We want to stay with you
for a while until we can get a farm of our
own.”
Mrs. Carey’s hand flew to her breast, and
she kept her attitude of listening long after
he had ceased to speak. All the life ebbed
from her heart, her knees trembled, and
she almost fell.
“Aren’t you pleased, mother?” inquired
the boy, wondering at her silence.
“Yes, ’Erbie, I’m real —glad,” she gulped,
still stupefied. Mrs. Carey took • the girl’s
hand in hers absently. “Yer can ’ave yer
own room fer as long as yer wants it. I’ll
run off an’ fix it up fer yer.”
During the preparation of her son’s room
Mrs. Carey sensed the first full bitterness
of her defeat. Carey had won. Her boy
was to be one with the pigs and oxen,
while his wife would for ever tread the same
dismal path she herself had traversed. She
wanted to cry, but decided that she must do
nothing that might let her son know that
she _ even cared. The bank-book felt cold
against her heart, so she took it out and
looked at tlie little figures, wondering
whether she might yet give the money to
Herbert as a start for his new life. But.
after all, it would be of little service; that
strange insipid child in the front room
would only fritter it away on useless trifles.
A great wave of misery engulfed the worn
little woman, completely shutting out the
world and sending her to her knees beside
the bed. Strange strangled sounds came from
the bowed figure, and the long-neglected tears
coursed down those faded cheeks.
Long afterwards she recovered herself to
find the room darkening at the approach of
night. Supper must be hurried on; there
was much to do, for another mouth had to
be fed. Back in the kitchen, she placed the
bank-book in its accustomed place on the
mantel-shelf, and turned to light the fire.
Prom the inside room Herbert’s voice came
indistinctly, the manly tones intermingling
with the lighter ones of her new daughter.
Mrs. Carey reached for the matches. Carey
came lumbering in from the fields, his clothes
redolent with the odor of sty and cowbail;
a horse whinnied loudly in the paddock with-
out. Carey had won, but he would never
know what she had lost; her secret was
safe.
Mrs. Carey struck a match; and, as the
tiny flame leaped into being, a new thought
came to the little mother, lifting her out of
the depths. When she raised her eyes from
the stove the room seemed all bright and
shining.
“P’r’aps ther money’ll be ’andy, after all.
Maybe Erbie’ll ’ave a son of ’is own; an’
then” She crooned the words ecstati-
cally, but softly, so that none might hear.
