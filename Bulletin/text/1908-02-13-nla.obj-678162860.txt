THE RED PAGE
THAT EPIGRAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I noticed in the Bulletin
How half-a-guinea he will win
Who sends (typed copy is the best)
The epigram held happiest
On cricket, now the sporting rage,
To him who runs the Purple Page.
“ What Ho ! ” I cried, and smiled in glee,
“ That ten-and-six is up to me ;
For though no cricketer I am,
I’ll find that winning epigram.”
Then on a dusty neighb’ring square
I sought the children playing there.
And spake to one who nursed a leg—
“ Sweet urchin, tell me now, I beg,
In simple words and sentence short,
What do you think of this your sport ? ’*
“You wait awhile and see,” he said,
I'll break the bally umpire’s head 1
Look at me shin ! and then—to git
Out leg-before as well as hit! ”
Anon, I sought a cricket ground
And there a dozen players found ;
And, picking one who seemed to be
With intellectuality
Adorned, stood drinks, and once more tried
To get the epigram supplied.
“ I’m secretary of this show,
And, if you really want to know,
It is not sport at all,” said he ;
“ It’s just a game of £ s. d.”
I tried again, ’twas at the Test;
A man who wore no coat and vest
All through the last hot trying day
Kept giving good advice away ;
So, when the winning hit was made
I lured him to a cooling shade.
“My friend,” I asked “ what is this game?"
He answered (as he gave it name),
“ Well, seeing as two quid I’ve lost,
I reckon it’s a blanky frost.”
MILEY WHITE.
THE ELEVEN, THE SCORE, AND THE
THOUSANDS
f twenty-two thousand that look
| on at the twenty-two are not stimu-
lated to epigrams. The solemn
ritual of scientific run-getting does not
stir the brain to brilliancy—judging
from the 199 epigrams that were sent in
in response to the modest request for a
definition of cricket. Here, for a taste,
are a few epigrams that failed :
Chiefly Recreation, In Couples, Keenly
Exasperating Twenty.
Walter J. Walters.
The attempt of two elevens to make more
than twenty-two.
Thos. Porter.
A ceremonious battering of a ball.
B. B. Atkins.
A game that ladies can witness without
blushing.
Albatross.
The defence of the wicket gate.
G. Bron.
Some mortals, a sphere and the Styx.
Poleaxe.
A game in which crowds of fools make
outings to watch the innings of a few.
L. Du Lane.
Cricket was invented by the Englishman,
not so much as a sport, as to persuade him-
self that he possessed a climate.
W. Gull.
An English game—an Australian fetich.
V. A. S.
The levelling of one small wicket for the
building of the big gate.
Geo. Beach.
Fooling with the ball to the bawling of
fools.
Nulla.
Misguided energy worthy of its namesake.
« P. Lebud.
The battle for the bawl.
Brooklet.
A game composed of bash, trash, ash and
cash.
Nulla.
Asses after ashes.
Hm.
The unscrupulous attaining the unneces-
sary.
Albatross.
Concern of a small brain for a small ball.
Helen Jerome.
An attempt to compile centuries while you
wait.
A.R.
Paying a blasted bob to behold Banner-
man blocking a ball.
E. B. Atkins.
A balance of probabilities—eleven on each
side.
E. F. G. Jolley.
Leather violently assaulted by the leather-
headed to the delight of the leather-lunged.
W. J. Morton.
So we are left with these—all passable :
Too literary :
The futile efforts of men to prevent the
sphere being hurled into the Styx.
S. J, Gilbert.
These two are clever, but hardly con-
cise enough :
A game requiring patience, practice and
endurance—on the part of the spectators.
A. F. Brasch.
Sport for twenty-two and advice from
twenty-two thousand.
Archibald Hett.
“ Jeach’s ” effort is too labored :
A game in which the players keep the
wicket, the club keeps the money, and the
public keeps both.
Jeach.
This has humor, but might equally
well apply to two-up :
A game. Call it work and forget it.
W. J. Morton.
And, for a rough-and-ready definition,
there is much to commend :
A crowd of chumps around six stumps.
J. 11. Sallinger.
W
So, in the final sorting, we are left
with three:
The endeavor of eleven to make a score.
Archibald Hett, 181 BarJdy-street,
St. Kilda.
Twenty-two men taking a ball home by a
circuitous route.
Thomas Porter, Woodside-road, Mt. Eden ,
Auckland, M.L.
A running like Hell-for-leather.
A. E. Weller, 1 Thelma Place, Perth, W.A.
The cleverness of Archibald Hett’s
epigram is, after all, a mere verbal clever-
ness ; the humor of Thomas Porter’s
quaint circuitous definition is essentially
Bulletinesque, and might have won, but
for the universal Australian appeal of
A. E. Weller’s crisp and slangy epigram.
The slang phrase “to go (or gallop, or
run) like Hell-for-leather ” is known to
every Australian bloke; and the many
who will disapprove of our choice may
be cricketers or critics, but they are not
blokes. And, really, the most painful
thing that can happen to a person is not
to be a bloke. So the paltry prize goes
to Westralia, and still more paltry con-
solation prizes will be forwarded to St.
Kilda and Mt. Eden.
A NOVEL OF FANTASY
Regretfully we must depose J. c.
Snaith. He joins the sad company
of cast-off monarchs who failed to
carry out their promises. In that literary
limbo he will find May Sinclair and
others—the pathetic potentates of one book.
Broke of Covenden and Henry Northcote
raised expectations that only a master could
satisfy ; and William Jordan, Junior (Con-
stable) but defers the final answer. This latest
novel of Snaith’s leaves things very much as
they were ; it does not show Snaith on the
way to become a second Meredith. The
work is interesting and remarkable, but the
author seems tired. He has lost himself in
the mists of fantasy ; he is risking the pos-
sibility of becoming unintelligible. "In
William Jordan, Junior, Snaith shows no
weakening of his originality ; but he suffers
solely from his own reputation; he has
been deposed by himself.
It is hard to imagine anything less like
the conventional novel than the life-story of
William Jordan. He is a weak and sickly
boy, strangely brought up by his father in the
back room of a small second-hand book-
shop. The child is reared on the
ancient authors, addresses his father as
“ thou,” and is so out of touch with modern
life that he cannot understand the speech,
still less the thoughts, of what he calls
“street persons”—which are you and me.
He is even afraid of the streets, afraid to
sleep in the dark; and everywhere in our
ordinary modern life he finds strangeness
and fear. The conception, it will be guessed,
affords a unique opportunity for a criticism
of the worth of our civilisation ; and the
boy’s impressions of a modern newspaper, of
an evening “party,” of the ballet, of a
cricket-match, are delightfully incisive pieces
of analysis. After his great adventure, at
the age of fifteen, of buying a newspaper, he
sits down to read the strange, new thing.
He knew Homer off by heart; but up till
this moment he had never seen a newspaper.
W
As he studied it,
“ A kind of proud bewilderment came over
him that Ms own personal initiative had
brought a thing of such mysterious import
into the little room. He began to read the
newspaper at the first word of the first page,
at the top corner of the left hand. He read
slowly and carefully every word the page
contained. He then turned to the next, and
continued to go word by word through each
one of the twelve pages. When he had
finished, he found to his consternation that
he had not been able to draw a single ray of
meaning out of all that vast assemblage of
words. After a period of reflection, he pro-
ceeded very carefully to read it again. His
failure to understand it proved just as
lamentable. In his chagrin and dismay he
read it a third time, and a foui'th ; he com-
mitted portions of it by heart ; he committed
other portions to paper. In the evening he
said to his father, with a blank face, 4 Why,
my father, dost thou know that I have not
the strength of understanding to comprehend
a phrase of what is written in the news-
paper.’
“ His father smiled in his secret manner.
“ ‘ Can it be, Achilles,’ he said, ‘ that
here is a bow that you cannot bend ? . . .
Is it not, beloved one, that these news-
papers are composed in the strange tongues
of those curious beings who walk the streets
of the great city 1 ’
“ ‘ You would say, my father,’ said the
boy, 4 that only street-persons can compre-
hend that which is written in these news-
papers of theirs ? . . . He that has a passion,
my father, to understand all things, must
even understand the contents of a news-
paper, must he not ? Yet, if he would
understand that, must he not first learn all
that these street-persons, who darken the
great city, are doing and thinking and talk-
ing about ?’
“ ‘The penalty is dire, beloved one,’ said
his father softly, 4 for all passions that are
imperious.’ ”
W
It will easily be guessed that a youth so
out of touch with his age must come to grief ;
though by luck he is given a job in a great
publishing house, over whose dignified
methods Snaith allows his sense of humor to
run riot, he is sent to gaol for six months for
theft. And in gaol the miracle happens.
William Jordan, for whom the novelist leads
us to expect vast achievements, sheds all his
hesitation and incompetency and emerges
upon his final phrase, with the long-needed
strength given to his right hand. After a
wander jahr with nature he returns to his
father’s room and writes his great poem—
writes it, so Snaith would have us to believe,
straight on, for five consecutive days—a
Eoem “longer than Paradise Lost.” Then
e sleeps for two days. Then follow
the efforts of a commonplace friend of the
poet’s to get the poem published. And here
Snaith uses his gift of satire to show us the
reception accorded by the world of pub-
lishers to a masterpiece. Ultimately it is
published by the payment of £3OO, but the
poet, already blind, and dying, is made
happy by a loving deception practised upon
him by his father and his friend They
announce to him the enthusiastic reception
of the work by the critics, and read him
bogus criticisms of the poem. The reviews,
of course, have not even mentioned the work.
The poet even sends the MS. of his great
work to the British Museum, there to be
preserved as a heritage for the nation ; and
the bewilderment of the officials at the receipt
of a brown paper parcel containing the MS. of
a writer who is not dead is solved by a janitor,
who lights the tire with it.
But when the poet lies dead, an old man, a
reviewer of books for one of the quarterlies,
arrives from Edinburgh, and, admitted to
the little room, sinks on his knees by the
bedside.
“ When he arose the aged man was gazing
at him with his half-blind eyes. They con-
fronted one another like a pair of children.
“ Suddenly the visitor leaned across the
bed in an act of further homage to the life-
less clay.
“ 4 W T hy do you do that ? ’ said the white-
haired man at his side.
“‘Why do I do this?’ said the other,
and his powerful spreading northern speech
appeared to strike the walls of the tiny
chamber. ‘ Why do Ido this ? lam afraid,
sir, it must be left to my great-great-grand-
children to answer your question.’ ”
On that vague note of hope this strange
novel ends. The book is an achievement,
and by an unknown author would have
assuredly aroused much speculation as to his
future. But Snaith must be compared with
no less an author than Snaith. F 2.

An art book, whose chief value resides in
its illustrations, is Artists of the Italian
Renaissance, by E. L. Seeley (Chatto and
Windus). The letterpress consists of trans-
lations from the Italian chroniclers, and is
as dull and rambling as most medieval
chroniclers were. The color and half-tone
reproductions of Italian pictures are well
done.
For the rapidly-increasing class of scientific
readers, Science Progress, a quarterly journal of
scientific thought (Murray, 55.), provides interest-
ing and up-to-date information. The articles in
the last number range from 44 Bread ” and “ The
Origin of the ‘Flower,’ ” to 44 The Pineal Gland.”
Most of these essay* are somewhat technical in
character, but all are authoritative.
WOMEN OF FLORENCE.
Out of Isidoro del Lungo’s Women of
Florence (translated by Mary C. Steegmann,
Chatto and Windus), the reader may glean
forgotten but interesting facts. The work is
an attempt to bring to light from private
chronicles the domestic life of Florentine
women from the period of the rise of the
Commune to the Renaissance—that name-
less multitude of the obscure chorus behind
the stage of the great tragedy.” In an in-
teresting preface Guido Biagi indicates that
the women herein pictured are neither
dames of high lineage nor the idealised
women of the poets, but ‘ ‘ those other more
humble figures, who within their own houses
played their modest parts in the simple
comedy devoid of exciting intrigue or heroic
adventure, inspired no songs or madrigals,
still less a famous epic.”
However, the historian discusses at length
one woman who, if humble in life, inspired a
great poem. He proves the actual exist-
ence of a certain woman named Beatrice,
“ Madonna Bice, wife to Messer Simone de’
Bardi,” for whom Dante’s literary love was
not at all incommodated by his marriage
with somebody else. In those days—which,
after all, were not unlike our days—poets
made a sharp distinction between their lady-
loves and their wives. They wrote sonnets
to their ideals—who were invariably married
to mere husbands—but they did not write
sonnets to their wives. Why, indeed, should
they 1 And it is not on record that Mrs.
Bardi was in any way perturbed in her
household tasks by the literary effusions of
that peculiar poet Dante. Probably she
knew him by sight. Isidoro del Lungo
points out that “the respective marriages
of the poet and his lady were events
entirely outside of, and indifferent to, the
psychological drama of the Vila Nuova. . . .
It must not be concluded that the Vita
Nuova is entirely deficient in historical
truth, and that Beatrice was a mere myth.”
She was his poetic lady, his symbol; but
indubitably there was a woman named
Beatrice for whose death Dante wept.
Among other curious facts dug up by the
historian is an account of the trouble that a
Sistice had in carrying out the sumptuary
ws of the Commune. Like all the
laws passed against the excessive luxury of
women’s attire, these laws proved futile.
Here are some of the aldermanic prohibi-
tions against feminine vanity : “ ISo woman
shall wear either crown or wreath, nor
pearls or precious stones, nor silk ...
neither shall she be permitted to wear more
than two rings upon her fingers, nor any
belt or girdle of more than twelve links of
silver. . . . And no woman shall wear the train
of her dress more than two braccia (46 inches)
in length behind, or cut out round the
neck more than a braccio and a quarter (29
inches).” The Florentine Judkins wentabout
the streets with his notary, looking for
pneumonia blouses, and, in the language of
his official report, “ He findeth one wearing
buttons in front of her dress, and he saith
unto her, ‘ Ye are not allowed to wear these
buttons.’ But she answereth, 4 Yea, Messer,
but I may, for these are not buttons, but
studs, and if ye do not believe me, look,
they have no loops, and, moreover, there are
no button-holes.” And the Lords Priori
gave up their vain effort to combat the vanity
of woman.
The book is charmingly put forth, and
illustrated with well-reproduced portraits—
several in color—of typical women of
Florence.

HOW LIGHT!—
that will be your first exclamation when you test the weight of a bicycle built of
B.S.A. FITTINGS.
“Mow good! ” will be your verdict after the severest test. Every part of such a
bicycle is designed by men of unrivalled experience, and manufactured in the finest
factory devoted to cycle component construction.
Don’t be put off with"B.S.H. pattern”—components so described are not of our
manufacture—they are not, as probably you will be told,“just as good”—they cannot
bear the mark of the Piled Rifles, which alone is a guarantee of genuineness.
Look for this mark on every part, see it is there—and be sure of satisfaction.

The Gyro-Car.
We ve seen a-many changes,
From molecule to sun,
As forwards science ranges—
And now the rAway’s done !
We follow where The pennon
Leads on the race afar,
For now Torpedo Brennan
Has launched his Gyro-Car.
Defunct as are the Sages
With all their ancient code,
We’ll hear no more of gauges
I hat ruled the double road ;
No side-thrusts and no jolting,
For soon, on gliding keels,
Shall gyro-cars go Ixdting,
Alive with whirring wheels !
The loco’s days are numbered ;
No more the growling trains—
That, huge and heavy, lumbered
Across the hills and plains—
Shall roar along the sleepers
With clanking coupling-bars ;
Expresses are but creepers
To Brennan’s gyro-cars.
And soon, by bank and siding,
The passenger shall hail
A swift land-monster, gliding
Along its mono-rail;
Its going and its coming
Unvexed by smoke and din ;
And noiseless, but for humming
Of living wheels within.
Above the stream that hisses
Down to some gloomy deep,
On cords across abysses
The winged car shall sweety
Appearing and dissolving;
Still on at whirlwind pace,
By law of things revolving
Held surely in its place !
Swift to adjust and parry—
More quick than brain or hand
Strong to bear up and carry,
To poise, and lean, and stand ;
Away, with flight unerring,
This triumph of the djinns
With duplex wheels a-whirring
Across the future spins.
We follow where the pennon
Of science soars ahead ;
Lead on, Torpedo Brennan,
As all the lights have led.
As forwards science ranges,
From monad up to star,
Not least of all the changes
Shall be your gyro-car !

The Nun.
I have but dreamed of Joy.
This sense of endless rest—
This commune with the Blest—
Is peace complete, without alloy,
Save this —that I have dreamed of Joy !
I have but dreamed of Love.
These four gray walls have held
My life from youth to eld.
As close pent as the caged dove ;
Yet sometimes I have dreamed of Love !
I have but dreamed of Life.
So now, with whitened hair
And sunken eyes, I stare
Down sheltered years, untouched of strife—
And weep ! I have but dreamed of Life !
N.S.W.
O.M.N.
Memories.
The scars we get in wars or life
Smart with brief pain ; when that is gone
Remains a memory of strife
That we are proud to think upon.
So, dreaming now o’er Jane—or Kate—
Their tender smiles, their laughing eyes,
My heart grows warm, yet desolate—
I would not have it otherwise !
F 'in love’s melancholy lies
A sweetness better than its glee,
And Mary’s lips and Edith’s eyes—
I love them best in memory.
From Time we hold the better part
Of everything we feel and know,
And Nell is shrined within my heart
In tender thoughts of long ago.
In dreams of Rose, my first-wished mate,
Unmarred by selfish passion’s strife,
I’m pleasantly disconsolate
(I do not say so to my wife);
But when we do not quite concur,
I sometimes wonder how ’twould be,
What gentle thoughts I’d have of her,
Were she a tender memory.
Yet would I never have it so—
That she should leave me desolate.
That feeling’s one I keep for Flo,
For Violet, and Jane, and Kate.
Her presence gives the sweet content
That I can feel in lovers missed,
In pleasant dreams of Millicent,
And sundry other girls I kissed.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Bailor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy .” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead o
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

MORE FEDERAL CAPITAL QUESTIONS.
Sometime during the current Federal session, it is
hoped, an effort will really be made to bring the
long-drawn-out question of the Australian capital
to a head. The only way in which that can be
done is by the passing of an Act to authorise the
Federal Government to take over, by formal occu-
pation, military or otherwise, the Monaro site
which it has legally selected as a Federal terri-
tory and capital. Then, if there is a semblance
of truth in the ravings of the Carruthers-Wadk
faction at Sydney, that faction will have a visible,
tangible “ Federal outrage” to carry to the High
Court, and the High Court will give it justice.
The present deadlock must end somehow and
sometime. According to the Constitution, the
site of the Australian capital must be in N.S.W.;
it must be at least 100 miles from Sydney,
though it may be any greater distance; it
must consist of at least 100 square miles, but
it may be any greater area so long as it doesn t,
after swallowing up all N.S.W. outside the 100-
mile limit of Sydney, go further, and spread
inside th&t limit. Subject to these conditions,
which may look absurd, but which, nevertheless,
were the conditions which George Reid, State
Premier of N.S.W., forced on the Commonwealth,
the selection of a site rests with the Australian
Parliament absolute’, v. Acting on its powers, and
following the adv.ce tendered by an expert
specially appointed by the N.S.W. State Govern-
ment to report on possible sites, the Australian
Parliament has selected Dalgety, on the Snowy
River. And after, with ridiculous patience,
allowing all progress to be blocked for four years by
some very ordinary notoriety-hunters in Sydney,
it is up to the Australian Government to move
decisively.
The position of ex-Premier Carrutiiers of
N.S.W. and of his successor, Premier Wade, is
simple enough. They represent the “State
Rights” element—a common, vulgar, rebellious,
advertisement-seeking institution which crops up
in the beginning of every movement towards
national union. The King of Bavaria and his
Government represented it at the beginning of
the present German empire. Nova Scotia and
that wretchedly commonplace demagogue Joseph
Howe represented\it at the beginning of the
Canadian Dominion, and for 18 long years the
Howe party shrieked secession, and passed secesh
resolutions in the State Legislature, and even
sent delegations to England to show that their
State was “ trodden on. In the United States
practically every one of the older members of th
Union got the State grievance complaint at one
time or another, and all the older States threat-
ened, at one time or another, to break away
unless the process of being trodden on
were relinquished. So Carruthers and Wade
don’t represent any principle; they only
stand for a very poor kind of skin-disease that
every voung Federation has gone through
since the time of the Israehtish Commonwealth
when Ephraim was the Ma State and the chrom
grumbler. In the struggle to maintain the theory
(1) that the States are greater than Australia, and
2 that N.S.W. alone is greater than the Com-
monwealth, it was necessary to select some im-
portant point to fight over CARRUTHERS and
Wade selected the Australian capital just as
THE SNOWY RIVER.

for a Federal Capital. This is the region where, according to N.S.W. State Premie
Wade, settlement is so close on the banks of the river that the water is sure to be con-
taminated. (Please look for the close settlement with a microscope.)

Britain and Spain once decided to fight over the
question of some alleged damage done to JENKINS
ear. The Wade-Carruthers theory is that the
capital must be moved somewhere, or anywhere,
from the site legally selected by the Australian
Parliament, so that by causing its removal they
can demonstrate the power of the State Govern-
ment of N.S.W. If the change now proposed can
be made, N.S.W. and Australia will both be
worse off, but the passing Wade of the moment
will enjoy his fleeting spell of petty triumph.
Wade will probably disappear from politics in
three or four years. He will probably be dead m
30 years. He will be dust some little time after
that. Long before he is dust he will be as com-
pletely forgotten in a political sense as, say,
Forster or Farnell, whom probably not one
Sydneyite in 1000 now remembers as having once
held the position Wade holds to-day. But it is
proposed, just to give a few seconds of self-com-
placency to the Insect of the moment, that Aus-
tralia should be condemned for centuries to have
its capital on a dry barren plain, with no water
supply worth mentioning, while a great gorgeous

river runs to waste not many miles away. It
doesn’t seem worth the sacrifice, even to please
Wade.
« * * *
The business is not one which concerns any one
or any two States. It is the duty of all Australia
to create for Australia a capital of which its people
may feel proud for all generations. In this respect
the difference between Canberra and Dalgety
stands out conspicuously. Canberra is served, in
a sense, by the same branch line which leads
towards Dalgety, and all the drawbacks that have
been charged to that branch line in Dalgety’s case
apply equally to Canberra. It lies about 10
miles off the line, so that unless the whole railway
is shifted it must be served by a sub-branch which
will come to a dead end at the capital of all Aus-
tralia. It lies in a wretchedly dry region.
Queanbeyan, 10 miles away, is the nearest
meteorological station, and the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Statistics report that over a series of
years Queanbeyan averaged 24 inches of rain
per annum—less than half the recordof Syd-
ney. On the other hand, the Kiandra district,
the rainfall of winch feeds the Snowy^ River, he-
ai'dP which the Australian capital is to stand,
an average of 64 inches. Drought, barrenness, and
the lack of any special ad vantages in the way
accessibility seem to be the reasons why Danoerra
wS viced by the State GovernmentandI why
it is nersistently supported. Apparently in t
desire of Carruthers and Wade to'
insult Australia, they see some points in clamor
intr for the worst kind of capital they can find, so
that its meanness will reflect their idea of the
meanness of Australia. A city .at Canberra, de-
pendent on a mere pencil streak of w»te.
would always be short of drinking and bathing
facilities; it would bean mnvholesome pDce
with unflushed drains, and typhoid germs, and
parched gardens and dried-up parks , it
be lighted cheaply by electricity furnished by
water-driven machinery as Dalgety coul ,
could it, like Dalgety, become the greatest and
cheapest manufacturing city in Australia by reason
of the unlimited force supplied almost free of cost
from a mountain river rushing past its doors.
Something about the dignity of Cudgegong or
Bvrock is what Nature fitted Canberrra to tie.
There are, in the N.S.W. Statistical Register
for 1905 (the last volume issued), records of the rain-
fall at 97 stations, and only 25 of these are drier
than Queanbeyan, the township alongside Can-
berra. If the dry western plains are left out of
consideration, there are only nine places in N .S. W.
with a worse record for continuous drought
than the horror which Carruthers and Wade
insist on recommending for a Federal city- And
it hasn’t, like some other dry regions— Bourke,
for example—the compensating advantage that a
river comes down to it from better-watered regions
beyond. It has nothing save its own local dribble
of water ; for the Murrumbidgee is practically
undrinkable, and in any case to lift contaminated
water over a ridge about 600 ft. or lOOft. lugfh
would be the last possible fool of an undertaking.
(As a side issue, a very similar lift will be required
to bring the waters of Cotter Creek to the site of
Wade’s proposed City.)

it is to be hoped, for thousands of years to
come. The alleged grievances of Sydney and
the alleged “claims” of Canberra (which is only
one house, anyway), and the alleged injuries of
Wade are of no more account than the grievances
of the fly that was before Romulus, or the
claims and constitutional rights of the beetle that
was previous to Constantine. Wade, when he
is dead, will be the same dust as the beetle, and
won’t know whether he carried his miserable
point of vanity and disorder or not; but hundreds
of years hence, when even the old borders of
N.S.W are as hard to find as the limits of the
old English kingdom of Mercia, Australia will
know whether its capital is a great city planted
on one of the finest watercourses in the continent,
or a dreary, hopeless little town on a dry plain.
And just because the Australians of to-day are
building for posterity as far ahead as the eye of
prophecy can reach, they should set to work reso-
lutely in a large spirit worthy of the size of the
undertaking. #
It is proposed that the Federal territory should
cover 900 square miles. The area is absurdly
small • 5000 square miles would be none too great.
Yet it is well-known that a serious attempt will
be made to cut the space down to 200 square
miles, which proposal is too ridiculous for words.
Svdney is the mere capital of a State, and it is
planted in a comparatively well-watered part of
the country, yet it requires nearly 400 square
miles for water catchment alone. Ihe
Snowy gathers its waters from a large
area, and every inch of that area needs
to be under the control of the Australian
Government, in order that it may ensure the
purity of the supply, and prevent it being
diverted by State interference. Ihe demand of
the State Frights people that the Federal Govern-
ment shall be content with a bit of ground for a
city, and leave the sources of its water supply
understate control, and trust to the State Gov-
ernment’s honesty and forbearance not to divert
the water and to guard it against infection, is too
thin If the Federal city’s catchment area is to
be kept clean and free from pollution it must he
kept, to a great extent, clear of settlement, and it
cannot be heavily stocked Therefore, if that
catchment area is left in State hands, it can t be
any appreciable source of revenue to the
State, and the Federal authority might as
well have it. The only reason why the State
Government can want to keep it is that it may
have the power to bully and threaten the Federal
capital, to remind it from time to time how much
it is dependent on State forbearance and how ex-
tensively it is at the State’s mercy, and to enjoy
the pleasure of seeing the Federal Government
coming to it in a respectful attitude, and asking
permission to put up a reservoir or do some such
necessary work. There is absolutely nothing else
to be gained by the State, and when the
C AKRUTHERS- W ADK party of parochialists is so
insistent on having the power to do these things
the Australian Parliament should assume that
they mean to make the worst usei of that
power —that being the only use they can
make of it—and be guided accordingly. In
this matter ..the recent episode of the
Cooma-Bombala railway is worth remembering.
That proposed line was to traverse the tableland
on which Dalgety stands. It might be taken
along the edge, through Nimitybelle, which would
he rather the shorter route, but also tbe
difficult, and there it would have on the east the
huge precipice which drops down to the coast, and
as no goods would be dragged up that precipice,
it would gather traffic from the west only. On
the other hand, it might be taken along a slightly
longer, but decidedly easier, route by dalgety,
whereby it would cross the tableland and gather
in traffic from both sides The decision was given
at once for the line by Nimitybelle, so as to be as
inconvenient to the Federal capital as possible.
Even then the N.S.W. Upper House m a
voice tremulous with anger and old age, if there
wasn’t some chance that the line would benefit
the Federal capital. It was assured by the
Government representative that there was none;
every care had been taken to be as narrow, aggra-
vating, unpatriotic, and disagreeable as possible-
But the Upper House wasn t satisfied. It said
that the line might benefit the Federal capital
after all, and threw it out. And the btate
Government acquiesced. There has been no news
of the Cooma-Bombala railway since.
The Australian Parliament should be taught bv
this experience, and take no risks. Supposing e
episodeof therailway tobeany criterion, the chances
are that, if the Federal capital is placed where it will
depend on the State Government of N.S.W for
its railway and road commumca-tion and its
water supply, it will have no railway or road
outlet, and no water supply-unless N.S.W. gets
a very different kind of State Government. On
the strength of that railway episode it is abso-
lutely essential that the Federal authority shall
control its own water catchment area, its own
reservoirs, and its own outlet for drainage ; that
it shall have its own port, lest the State Govern-
ment carefully makes the road to the nearest port
impassable ; and that the territory shall be a
border one. with an alternative outlet through a
State where Wade doesn’t rule, and where GAR-
ruthers doesn’t clamor, and where there is no
Sydnev Telegraph or Evening News, or similar
anti-Australian influence. The hint conveyed
in the throwing out of the Cooma-Bombala Kaii-
way Bill was broad enough for any Legislature
which can see into the future. Even if 10,0 W
square miles of country are required to make tne
Federal city secure, the area should be insisted
upon.
*** * -
A curious, sham-constitutional point which has
been raised before, and which will doubtless
raised again in the final fight over the Federal
capital settlement, is to the effect that the P
posed Dalgety site, because it abuts on Victoria,
isn’t wholly and legally “in N.b.W , and as th
capital must be “in ” N.S.W. the Dalgety site is
therefore illegal. The point is almost too absurd
be worth mention; if theproposed Dalgety site isn
“in ’’ N.S.W., in the ordinary sense of the term,
then the question arises—what State is it in •
But it is a quaint fact that, if anyone desire,
to stickle for the extraordinary sense ot tne
term, a Federal capital at Canberra or Gynm
hurst, or anywhere else, wouldn t re y
be “in ” N.S.W. That part of the Constitution
which says that the capital must beinJN.o.v*.
can’t be read quite literally. Logic makes!*
impossible. When that incredible bungler
George Reid, got the other Premiers togethe
and started tinkering with the Constitution,
and his unauthorised colleagues managed to pro
duce this new clause ...
125. The seat of government of the \ e
shall be determined by the Parliament, an or
within territory which shall have been gr ted ( n
acquired by the Commonwealth, and * South
and belong to the Commonwealth, and, if New be
Wales be an original State, shall be mthat Sta ,
distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney.
Taken in the most horribly literal sense,
clause reads that the Federal capital shall be
N.S.W., and at the same time shall not oe
N S W., but in some area that has wh J
ceased to be N.S.W. and has become a separat
Commonwealth territory. No doubt the“jjjj
Court, if the matter ever comes be t° re e
hand down a common-sense reading of the
which will straighten matters out; DU " t
italicised words are, none the less, am on urn
George Reid’s incapacity as a Farharnentary
draftsman. Anyhow, if a question « raised * i
whether the proposed Dalgety site, hemg ,
Victorian border, is legally m w -“-”V th j 8
obvious answer is that, for the purposes
clause, it is just as much there as any o
possible site is likely to be.


THE QUEENSLAND ELECTION, AND THE
POSTAL VOTE THAT SAVED
ROBERT PHILP.
Queensland has given its decision. It is weary
to death of Philp, the monumental incapable—
Philp, the Tory and the blunderer —Philp of the
huge deficits, and the big loans, and the un-
limited promises. Two of his Ministers have
gone; a good section of his party has
gone; and but for the swindle and fraud of the
postal vote Philp would be gone likewise. The
postal vote was an invention of the Devil, who, in
this case, was the Tory Upper House. It destroys
the secrecy of the ballot; enables the employer,
who is mostly a Tory, to coerce his employee to
vote the Tory ticket; permits the J.P., who is
mostly a Tory, to bully lone females to vote the
Tory ticket, and gives him a fair opportunity to
fake their ballot papers and make them appear to
vote the Tory ticket when they didn’t, or to sup-
press their votes altogether if the lone female has
voted so definitely for the Democratic candidate
that the ballot paper can t be altered or faked or
forged. The Queensland postal vote not only
provides that persons who are absent from their
electorates on polling day may vote by post, but
it allows any woman, whether she is absent or
not, to vote by post. But her ballot must be
witnessed by a J.P., therefore quite a lot of things
happen. Swarms of Js.P. go round and call on
unmarried women, or on married women when
their husbands are away at work and can’t assault
the J.P., and affably invite them to vote for Smith,
the Tory candidate, and to fill up the papers
at once. If the woman voter is known to
be a Democrat, she may be assured that Smith,
the Tory, is really the Labor candidate, and very
often she is taken in. If this device doesn’t work,
she may be urged, in any case, to vote on the
postal system for Brown, her own candidate, and
to let the obliging J.P. take her ballot paper to
the post office for her, and thus save her trouble.
Very often this device does work, and then there
are three possibilities : (1) that the lady, making
the necessary mark on the ballot paper where the
J.P. tells her to do it, will, in her flurry, vote for
Smith, the Tory, after all; (2) that if the vote is
really given to Brown, it will be found possible
to alter the paper after the J.P. gets it; (3) that
if it is impossible to make the ballot paper into a
vote for the Tory Smith, it will be burnt so that,
at all events, it won’t count for the abhorred
Democrat, Brown.
* * * *
It is needless to say that the Tory employer
often brings much pressure to bear on his female
employees to induce them to vote by the postal
system, which offers such splendid facilities for
either suppressing the vote given for Brown, the
Democrat, or for turning it into a vote for the
Tory, Smith. And it is worthy of note that the
Philp Government, during its brief spell of office,
appointed a horde of new Js.P., many of whom,
according to common report, at once started to
scour the country per bike, horse, or buggy in
search of postal votes. And it is so well known,
not only in Queensland, but also outside Queens-
land, that the postal vote is a Tory
swindle, that when the polling left Robert
Philp and his Tory colleague, Hanran,
in a serious minority at Townsville, even
the Sydney papers remarked that the postal vote
was yet to be counted and the blessed pair would
probably be all right as soon as that was done.
Sydney is a long way from Townsville, but the
fact that the postal vote at Townsville would almost
certainly, by a curious combination of circum-
stances, prove to be a solid Tory vote, was quite
well known even to the Tory papers of the
N.S.W. capital. And they were right. Through
the dirt and degradation of the postal vote fraud,
Robert Philp crawls back into the Legislature,
in which he has been a curse to Queensland’s
public interests.
* * * *
It is impossible as yet to say with certainty what
will be the next move in Queensland politics. Kid-
ston, Bowman, and Philp lead three parties that
are not very far from equal. But the Kidston
and Bowman parties are both Democratic, and are
separated by very small differences. In fact, the
chief difference lies in the character of the leaders.
Kidston is the honest practical Democrat who
takes one step at a time, and Bowman is the
honest but visionary Democrat who regards
Kidston’s Scottish caution as lukewarmness
in the cause. When The Bulletin described
Kidston as being placed between the robbers and
the dreamers it sized up the whole situation. But
Philp and his gang of political brigands stand
outside the pale. Queensland hasn’t definitely
decided whether it wants the Kidston brand of
cautious progress or the wliole-hog ideas
of Bowman —probably it wants the two leaders
to combine, and form a Government that
will be a little faster than Kidston and not quite
so sudden as Bowman —but it has decided by a
huge majority that it regards Philp and his
Tory following as impossible and accursed. Some
arrangement or coalition between the two Demo-
cratic parties, to enable them to carry on the
Government, is urgently necessary. And the first
duty of any new Government that may be formed is
to make a rigid inquiry into the mysteries of that
postal vote which saved Robert Philp’s seat at
Townsville. When it was so well known that the
postal vote —supervised by the mainly Tory J.P. —
would pan out as an almost solid Tory vote, that
Tory papers nearly 1000 miles away from the
scene of action explained cheerfully how the
counting of that vote would almost certainly make
good Philp’s shortage at the polls, it is certainly
time for an inquiry.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wade Hollers about a Federal Capital.
Some recent remarks about the proposed-Aus-
tralian capital shifted Mr. Gregory Wade, State
Premier of N.S.WL into a state of excitement,
and the Sydney Telegraph and S. M. Herald
came out with inspired paragraphs to this effect:
Referring to some illustrations published in a weekly
paper, with the object of comparing the magnitude of the
Snowy River, the “ water frontage ” of Dalgety, with the
insignificance of the Cotter River, which is the source of
the water supply for the Canberra site, Mr. Wade said the
obvious suggestion was that the water supply for the
capital, if Dalgety was chosen, is to come from the Snowy
River. “ There is no doubt that the Snowy River is a fine
body of water,” the Premier added, “ but it has settle-
ment along its banks for many miles above Dalgety. lhe
commissioner distinctly eliminated the Snowy River as a
source of water supply, and recommended that the supply
be drawn from the Moonbah, which, like the Cotter, is
free from the danger of contamination from settlement.
In other respects it resembles the Cotter, and, what-
ever may be the demerits of the Cotter, this at all events
is clear—that the gaugings taken in the t )e £ mnl 'ht
January, when the river was abnormally low, showed the
daily flow to be equal to the present consumption of water
in the Sydney metropolitan area.”
That represents Wade at his best. He ap-
parently didn’t take the least trouble to find out
whether the Snowy River is contaminated by
anything worth calling “settlement ” or not; he
just made the statement and fitted it to
his case. To get down to exact details: Eight
miles above Dalgety is Merritt’s house—the
first sign of settlement in that direction. Eight
miles further is Rose’s house—the second sign of
settlement. These make two houses in 16 miles.
After that, the average of settlement along the
river is about one house in 20 miles. There are
probably 20 residences in all on the Snowy above
Dalgety and on its principal branches. And this
includes the so-called town of Jindabyne—which
consists of about three structures. The whole lot
could be shifted at the cost of a few thousand
pounds, and nobody ever finds a water supply for
a city without incurring some small expense like
that. As for Cotter Creek having a supply of water
equal to the daily consumption of Sydney, the state-
ment is too absurd for words. The real length of
Cotter Creek, The Bulletin is this week in-
formed, is 24 to 26 miles. Like any other little
creek it rises rapidly during rain, and falls almost
immediately when the rain stops. It carries a
city’s supply sometimes, and many times a cow
could almost drink it dry. And even if Cotter
Creek would furnish a fair supply of drinkables to
a Federal city near Canberra, it isn’t so good a
supply as the Moonbah would furnish —if it was
decided not to use the mountain waters of the
Snowy—to a city at Dalgety. And the city at
Dalgety would then be the whole Snowy River
to the good. That would mean force almost
gratis in sufficient quantities to electrically light
and heat a metropolis, and to run as many
manufactures as there are in Sydney and
Melbourne combined. Even Wade hasn’t
the front to suggest that there is any-
thing of this kind at Canberra. So the ques-
tion still crops up—why does Wade want a site
at Canberra unless it is to gratify his vanity by
showing that his own unaided cantankerousness
can shift the capital of all Australia, and because
he wants to increase his pomp and importance by
encroaching on Federal rights ? As for the
Sydney papers that support Wade, they seem to
do it simply because (1) it is their habit to
support Wade ; (2) it is their habit to be
nasty to tjhe Commonwealth. When a Bulletin
representative the other day explored the mass of
dry boulders and fallen timber and the trickle of
water that were then posing as most of Cotter
Creek, he was assured by a local inhabitant (there
are a few settlers along the Cotter, same as along
the Snowy, though Wade doesn’t mention them)
that he was the first newspaper man who had ever
come so far. There was a legend that one Sydney
paper had sent along a representative, who looked
at the entrance to the Cotter from across the
Murrumbidgee. and left things at that. There
was no news of any other papers having attempted
to investigate the merits of the place they
clamored for—they just clamored for it because
Wade did. And Wade apparently hollered just
for the sake of being disagreeable to the Common-
wealth. He seems to have started hollering for
Canberra long before he took the trouble to look
at it, or to go near it.

The Tory Press as a Prophet.
The Queensland election drives home a fact which
was revealed over and over again at Seddon’s
elections in Maoriland, and which has been twice
expounded within recent years at Federal elec-
tions in N.S.W. —the feeling of a country can’t be
judged by its newspaper press. The press is
almost always more Tory than the people, because
rich men are mostly Tory, and it is rich men who
can afford to buy up newspapers. Then they put
their own Tory views in these papers, and repre-
sent them as the unanimous and concentrated
howl of the community ; and to the person who
reads, but has no independent thinking apparatus,
the mass of Tory public opinion seems over-
whelming. If any unsophisticated stranger had,
on any given day during the recent electoral cam-
paign, got a copy of every paper published in
Queensland, and waded laboriously through the lot,
he would have emerged with a tolerably firm convic-
tion that Philp’s victory wasassured, and that Kid-
ston and Bowman had better give up the hopeless
struggle and run for some kind of billet nearer to
their size—an alderman’s job, for instance. The
Tory press was proud with the pride that makes
the frog climb up on the balcony ; and it was
supercilious and confident, and it fell in. In the
same way, at the election which put Ballance at
the head of affairs in Maoriland, and at Seddon’s
first two elections later on, the amazing unanimity
of the press would have made a stranger imagine
that those two men hadn’t a friend in the country;
yet, with almost every paper busily demonstrating
the certainty of their defeat, they swept the polls
at every time of asking. And a unanimous daily
press in Sydney, also a good deal of the press
outside Sydney, has been assuring N.S.W. fora
long dreary while that (1) the State is strongly
Foreign trade; (2) itisstrongly Toryand Anti-Sosh ;
(3) it simply yearns for the leadership of George
Reid; (4) it is raving mad at the “wrongs”
of N.S.W. ; (5) it won’t stand at any price the
Federal capital selected by the Australian Parlia-
ment ; (6) it has risen as one man to demand a
Federal city at Canbera, or any other of the sites
that the daily press nominates to-day and drops
to-morrow. Yet meanwhile N.S.W., when elect-
ing members for the House of Reps., turned Pro-
tectionist right before the eyes of the buzzard
press ; it rejected the Anti-Sosh party by a
big majority; it not only almost demolished
George Reid’s Federal following, but it came
fairly near, last election, to demolishing Reid
himself ; it doesn’t even know what the
“wrongs” of N.S.W. are; and nobody can
raise any semblance of a public curse against
the proposed capital on the Snowy River, or a
penn’orth of visible popular enthusiasm re Can-
bera. The Tory press is a gigantic and rather
futile bluff. Now and then its bluff succeeds,
and it annexes the stakes with only a small pair
to go upon, but as a rule it overdoes the thing.
Again the Freetectionist Person.
A characteristic of the Freetrader is that while
rabidly Freetrade wherever the policy is a matter
of theory, he is mostly a fervent Protectionist
when it comes to practice. Apropos Lord
Cromer’s recent pro-Freetrade speech, one W. <j.
Ling writes from Cairo to the London papers,
alleging that he (Ling) is “bewildered. Lord
Cromer, it is pointed out, “ruled Egypt with a
rod of iron for 25 years,” and during that time im-
posed a “ Protective tariff on every article capable
of Protection.” If Lord Cromer reckons b ree-
trade to be the only sane fiscal doctrine,
why, demands Ling, didn’t he inaugurate it
during the quarter of a century’s chance he had .
Wherefore deny the boon to poor old Egypt,
bowed beneath the weight of its years, and its
debts, and its dirt, and its pyramids and dead
Pharaohs, and attempt to rum the aged spot .
Also whv, under the burden of Protection, didn t
Egypt get properly ruined ? How was it that Egypt
uprose during those 25 years of fiscal bhght, and
flourished, and paid its debts? These are the
complaints Ling levels at Cromer ; also he
points out mournfully that the portion of the
speech referring to the danger of Great
Britain arousing foreign hostility by imposing
a tariff against Europe has been copied
into the native press, and “huakh&f” (“he is
afraid ”) is the judgment passed on their late idol
by the perceptive local niggers. Ling’s bewilder-
ment is due mainly to the amazing “ trueness to
type ” of the Freetrade enthusiast, whether he be
found in Egypt, or N.S.W., or Sheol. When re-
quired merely to theorise vaguely on a platform,
this brand of economist can talk the platitudes of
his creed with the best; when responsibility and
practical needs face him he jettisons the views of
the late Cobden with despatch. There is a
horrible resemblance between the attitudes of
Cromer and N.S.W.’s own Greid in this respect.
Didn’t Know it was Loaded.
A provision was put in the N. S. Wales Arbitra-
tion Act enabling unions to sue members for con-
tributions, and to compel members to go on being
members for a given time. While the papers and
the politicians like 0. G. Wade were throwing a
daily handful of mud at the Act and at Arbitra-
tion, this provision was held up to very special
execration. “ Unionists under Compulsion !
shrieked the Sydney D.T., while the S. M.
Herald said it was monstrous that the law should
be used to collect labor-union dues. Time after
time The Bulletin pointed out that unions
were responsible for what their members did,
and if the law wanted to clothe the unions with
responsibility, the only way to do it was to give
them a legal hold over their members. If mem-
bers could “ pull out ” at 24 hours’ n<~' '?e, or on
no notice at all, obviously it would ~e no use
making an award against a union, because imme-
diately an adverse decision was given the union
would vanish into thin air. Still, argument didn’t
trouble the Arbitration-wreckers, and the union
officers who went to the Courts were made to feel
that they ought to be ashamed of themselves—
that they had no proper respect for human liberty,
and that they were so depraved that a man’s con-
science was nothing to them. So much mud of
this sort was thrown at them and at the Act that
the unions practically let that part of the law go
—especially as the Courts, too, had begun to be
unfriendly. Now there is trouble up at New-
castle, and the N.S.W. Government, having
found out that, after all, strikes are much too
terrible to be tolerated, has appointed a special
Arbitration Court. But, unfortunately, either
side can withdraw from that Court if a strike or a
lock-out takes place; and as little tinpot
strikes have been occurring all the time,
the settlement of the big trouble by the
Court has been again and again im-
perilled. Things reached a climax on Tuesday
of last week, when there was another little strike,
and the owners’ representative declined to go on
with Arbitration. Then Judge HeYdoN, the pre-
sident, simply had to let himself go. What was
the use of going on if they simply floundered from
strike to strike ? He had, he said, his own self-
respect to consider, and he wasn’t sure whether
he ought not to resign his commission. However,
it was such a big matter that he would give the
Miners’ Federation a chance to say—“We will
put our foot down and severely punish the boys
who strike without reference to us.” So spoke
a Judge, specially trained in these matters, con-
fronted with the practical difficulties in connec-
tion with the peaceful settlement of industrial
troubles. It all only proves over again the excel-
lence of the Act as it was originally framed by
B. R. Wise. During all the long, ignorant, and
venomous attacks upon the Act and the prin-
ciple underlying it, it has been cheerfully assumed
that the principle was adopted haphazard, and
that the Act Was just chucked together anyhow.
As a matter of fact, the principle was only
adopted after long and careful consideration, and
after the strike method had brought Australia
nearer civil war than it ever was before or, let us
hope, will ever be again ; and the Act was drafted
by men who had given years of special study to.
the question, and after a Royal Commission—
Judge Backhouse —had travelled around gather-
ing the experience of those who had adopted
Arbitration elsewhere. Such practical difficulties
as are now arising at Newcastle were foreseen and
provided for. In their fatuous ignorance those
who have been throwing mud at the Act and at
Arbitration could not see the difficulties and
dangers, and therefore could not see the need to
provide for them. And if, having covered the
law with ridicule, having taught the public to
have a profound disrespect for it, the State can
now escape the consequences of the folly of such
as Wade, the present Premier, and almost the
whole daily press, the State will be more for-
tunate than it deserves to be.
Japan and America.
The latent feeling among Americans that to whip
Japan is a necessary preliminary to peace in the
Pacific, gets expression now and again by some
unguarded utterance or reckless newspaper article.
Thereupon responsibility says, in an awed voice,
“ H-s-sh,” and official assurances are poured out
that the American fleet is going round the Horn just
for fresh air, and the Philippines are being fever-
ishly stocked with arms and ammunition for no
particular reason at all. But it is quite plain that
war between the two nations will come unless
Japan revises its behavior considerably. An
argument in favor of that revision is the bitter
poverty which Nippon has had to face since the
weary, resultless war with Russia. A force on the
other side is the national swelled-head, and the
dream that the next war might be made to pay a
dividend by means of plunder, annexations, and
the collection of an indemnity. The Japanese
populace’s vanity has been so pumped up of late
that there is an ever-present danger of the
mob taking charge of affairs, and forcing the
rulers into a war against all considerations
of prudence. Another possible development is
that the Japanese rulers, finding themselves un-
able to stem the flood of Jingoism, will direct it
against, not America, but China. A war against
China would offer some cheap glory and the
possibility of restoring the crippled finances of
Japan by the exaction of a huge indemnity as the
price of "peace. The Japanese mind would not be
at a loss for a pretext if such a war were con-
sidered advisable. But it is at least doubtful
whether the white races would stand by and see
Japan ravage China ; for the ultimate result of a
China absolutely under the dominance of Japan
would bring the Yellow Peril within strangle-
hold of Caucasian civilisation.
Defence and Protection.
A contribution from “ Fluffy ” :
“Copper” (B. 26/12/’O7) has regrets for the ingots of
Wallaroo copper exported what time sheet, wire, and
cable are imported. When the Spanish-American war
began the U.S.A. found it necessary to order huge quan-
tities of wire for the field telephone and telegraph service.
In Cuba the U.S.A. General could ring up his base at any
time. In one instance, while a battle was in progress, the
officer commanding the U.S.A. troops was switched on to
White House, Washington, and made his report direct to
the President. A little bit theatrical, but it serves for an
illustration. Modern warfare demands such means
of communication, and it will take hundreds of tons
of wire. The difference between Australian and American
conditions is that the Americans had their factories
equipped and running before the war began. It appears
that Australia will go to war first and depend on worry-
ing through with imports, or with makeshifts locally im-
provised. It would be excellent policy for the Post Office
to establish its own wire-drawing works. Something may
be said for this from the economic and political aspects, but
the military importance of such an establishment is
beyond question.
iron manufactures are wanted against the day of war.
Lithgow should be made to flourish, not because of the
price of rails, but because rails are a munition of war, and
will be wanted in great quantity when Australia, by its
own or its relatives’ policy, gets tangled with some
foreign power. Great Britain recognises rails as con-
ditionally contraband, and so does Japan. If military
operations were in course at Newcastle or Sydney, rails
consigned thither would be regarded as contraband of war.
The law of contraband is worth a moment’s attention.
Australia is bound by the British Admiralty’s policy as a
matter of fact and law and reason. Arms are absolutely
contraband and all machinery for their manufacture.
Australia has no small arms or ordnance factories, though
I am proud to think that our big engineering shops, in-
cluding the railway shops, could be of some assistance—
but this is not enough. Of course ammunition and its
parts are contraband. Australia to an insufficient degree
does make cartridges. The Colonial Ammunition Co.
imports brass blanks for the cases, nickel blanks for the
bullets, primers and cordite, and puts the lot together at
its works, Footscray (Vic.). In time of war Australia
might have to get the enemy’s permission to import these
cartridge parts. The establishment of a cordite factory
No Opening.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Owing to the glowing accounts in the papers in
regard to emigrants’ chances in Australia, I went there.
At a boarding-house they offered me 10s. a week. . . .
There is absolutely no opening for butlers or footmen in
Australia.— Shrill ivail in an English newspaper.
Listen, brethren, to the wail
Of the person soft and pale—
Heed a palpitating butler, heed the anguished
Jeames’s warning ;
For the footman hither steaming,
Of great affluence a-dreaming,
He will weep and he will sorrow, he will rage in
bitter scorning !
Like that Job who wailed of old,
He will quiver unconsoled,
And the ashes on his hat-brim he will pile in
lamentation ;
For the fact, alas ! is known—
Hear the distant footmen groan—
That Australia needs no persons of the buttling
occupation !
For the English artisan
And the earnest working man
There’s a job gesticulating in the glad Australian
distance;
For the chap who hammers steel
And can lay a steamer’s keel
Lo, this land of ours is shouting with a voice of
loud insistence !
Anybody who can work,
Any man who will not shirk—
These Australia welcomes gladly, and she’ll find
a job to suit them ;
But the party tall and drear—
He’s a useless substance here,
So he’d better stay in Hingland where the land-
lords fat recruit them.
Here’s a continent to till,
Calling men of granite will—
Calling Europe’s best to labor with their thews
and corded muscles;
Every man whose blood is red —
He will find a job ahead,
But Australia scorns the flunkey with the strength-
less white corpuscles !
We have ships to launch and man
And a Commonwealth to span—
We have lands to plough and harrow, we have
wool to weave and fashion ;
But there’s nary job in sight
For the plush-accoutred wight—
Aye, this land’s the worst existing for poor
Jeames to hunt for cash on !
’Ome in Hingland, far away,
Let the helpless footman stay—
Let the butler cling to Hitchin and the joys of
placid Surrey ;
Let him pass the nuts and wine
Where the haughty landlords dine—
’Ware Australia, .Jeames and Joseph— it’s a land
in Hell’s own hurry !
Persons sleek and parties slow
Will avoid much pain and woe
If they stop at ’Ome in Britain, where they wor-
ship jimp regalia ;
We must toil like Titans here,
Disregarding golf and beer —
Yea, there’s work piled up in mountains ’way
down south in young Australia !
Britain’s wheezy, Britain’s old,
Likewise damp and dull and cold,
And the butler tamely browses with a calm and
vacant eye now ;
There the footman, like the sheep,
Meditateth half-asleep.
But Australia’s star goes blazing like a meteor up
the sky now.
Asia’s drum we hear afar,
And the countless Tasks that Are—
They are howling out for workers with a voice
like all Jehannum ;
Lest our land sink in eclipse,
We must build our fighting ships—
We must launch our ships of battle—in red haste
we’ll build and man ’em !
So the buttling folk at ’Ome
Would be ill-advised to roam,
For we mean to smite our landlords with a tax
that’s most emphatic;
And the footman person, he
Should infest his livery
In the halls of dear Hold Hingland—-where the
paupers crawl rheumatic!
He who flunketh, let him flunk
Where the maudlin London drunk
In the gutter sadly lifteth dreary sounds of lamen-
tation ;
For Australians all must Work,
And sleek Jeames is prone to shirk—
Yea, a hundred million butlers wouldn’t make
one stalwart Nation !

seems to be contemplated. A par. going the rounds has
it that a cordite factory is to he established in Victoria
and a siiall-arms factory in N.S.W. Presumably the
gun-carriages will be made in Westralia, saddlery and
harness in South Australia, army and navy clothing in Tas-
mania, and the ordnance in Queensland. This would put
a fowl in every State’s pot—and, incidentally, put Austra-
lia’s pot on. Paragraphs that go the rounds are not always
reliable, and it is possible yet that military necessity and
not parish-pump politics will determine the location and
organisation of Australia’s arsenal.
Returning to contraband, it is to be noted that Great
Britain recognises as absolutely contraband all naval and
military stores, including masts and spars, cordage,
marine engines and parts, anchors, angle iron
and plate. Contraband is a big net with a
very fine mesh. Circumstances such as destina-
tion may make contraband the following:—Pro-
visions and liquors fit for the consumption of the army
or navy, money, telegraphic materials (such as wire,
porous caps, sulphuric acid), railway materials, coal, hay,
horses and timber. Australians who are content to
depend on foreign supplies in time of war are warned to
consider the difficulties. If the enemy be a first-class
naval power the difficulty of getting transport
in the first place, and the risk of running the gauntlet of
the enemy’s cruisers in the second, will make supplies
uncertain and ruinously expensive. Preparation for war
is held to be the best guarantee of peace. Preparation
for war includes more than drill halls and military en-
campments. An army wants transport, and that includes
railways, permanent way and rolling stock, fuel, waggons,
horses and forage. It means the equipment of camps,
tents, rugs. It means the commissariat of an army—
food by the ton, drink by the tank. An army
must be clothed. An army must be armed and kept
armed ; supplied with ammunition and kept supplied.
Loud and insistent demands for ammunition will be
heard from every corner of Australia —those called “ to
battle in the mornin’ ” will want cartridges ; those not
yet called will want to practise shooting. In that day,
to what extent will Australia depend on the Antipodean
or foreign contractor? British war demands will be
large. Australia will have second, third, or fourth call in
British markets. In Australian markets alone will it be
first, and that is why those local markets should be large
and varied.

The Danysz Microbe.
The pertinacity of the Danysz microbe people is
wonderful. The official report of Dr. Tidswell,
founded on the recent exhaustive experiments at
Broughton Island, read thus :
I am far from being assured that the microbe can be
successfully used for the destruction of rabbits. Whilst
it has been easy to arrange conditions under which the
disease will prevail amongst these animals in confine-
ment, yet such conditions do not represent a natural
state of affairs, and the extent of dissemination has
appeared to become progressively less as the area to be
covered has increased. This result is explicable since the
disease is spread, principally at least, by direct convey-
ance from rabbit to rabbit; the more room the animals
have the less chance there will be of contact close enough
for transfer of the disease between them. The natural
behavior of an identical or at least indistinguishable virus
upon the mainland of Australia in past years has not
sufficed to keep the rabbits in check, and no result has
come out of the experiments to indicate that the virus
can be artificially manipulated with greater efficiency.
As already remarked, the factors of infection are un-
known, so that it is very problematical if we can acquire
sufficient practical control over them to determine epi-
zootics when and where we will. For my own part, I
have gleaned from the experiments the impression that
the task of harnessing the microbe is likely to prove a
difficult and uncertain process.
Which at least doesn’t encourage Australia to
spend large sums on the microbe. But the capi-
talists who have the microbe under their pa! on-
age seem to be all the more inflamed by this
report as to its probable uselessness, and desire
more bitterly than ever to undertake its expensive
dissemination. They’re prepared to make a State
Frights issue of the matter, and secesh if they are
not allowed to waste their money in spreading
microbes around. All of which confirms The
Bulletin’s suspicions that it is not the rabbit so
much as the rabbit-trapper that the Danysz
microbe is aimed at. It seems certain that
it will not kill the rabbit nuisance,
but will certainly kill the rabbit-trapping busi-
ness, which to some people is also a nuisance.
But Australia, if it allows the dissemination of
the Danysz virus, will probably find itself ulti-
mately in a much worse plight than before. The
rabbits will be just as numerous, and the rabbit-
trapping industry, which acts as some sort of a
check, and which brings in some revenue, will be
ruined by the widely-spread “report” that the
bunny of Australia is a diseased beast, to eat
which is lingering death.

The Canadian roughs who lately haggled their
way through a lacrosse tour in Australia have got
back home, and are telling the Frozen Country
papers some amazing yarns. Miller, the manager,
is particularly sorry for Australia. The railways,
which “ sickened him of public ownership,” creep
along the coast (Miller evidently missed the
Perth-Kalgoorlie line, and the one from Port
Augusta to Oodnadatta, and the Port Darwin-
Pine Creek railway, and the eight lines which strike
inland from Melbourne, and the lines from Sydney
to Bourke, Cobar, Hay, etc., and the Hobart-
Launceston railway, and four big Queensland
railways, and some sundries). “Their principal
use,” says Miller, “is for forwarding mails ; the
freight and even the passengers go mostly by
steamer.” Last year the N. S. Wales railways alone
carried 41,413,084 passengers ; but a small matter
like 41,413,084 is neither here nor there. Things
are, however, likely to improve any time now,
according to Miller, as the benighted coun-
try lately had a glimmer of sense, and
imported “Mr. Tait, a Canadian, to try to put
the Australian railways on a paying basis.” Still,
Bent encouraged any visiting (Canadian bounder
to say that sort of thing, by going to the shriek-
ing, man-smashing, land-dealing Canadian cos,
for a manager. As for the rest, there are,
according to Miller, hardly any buildings
in Melbourne more than one storey high; the
labor element “has the eight-hour day, and
is agitating to have it reduced to six hours ” ;
when Australians can’t find any other amuse-
ments they race dogs; and “ the West Australian
Government exacts a royalty on all the gold
mined—even the piece of ore given Mr. Miller
as a souvenir had to be accounted for.” Whether
the Canadian papers have misrepresented their
lacrosse roughs, or whether the lacrosse roughs
have misrepresented Australia, isn’t certain ; but
between them, anyhow, they have managed not
to mention anything without putting such fabulous
frills about the truth that its best friend wouldn’t
know it.

N.S.W. Premier Wade’s foolish statements
about the alleged failure of London County Coun-
cil’s Socialistic enterprises, in his recent munici-
pal election manifesto, proved too strong for even
the Anti-Sosh S. M. Herald, and that paper
(6/2/’08), in an article on “ Local Governnient, ”
told Wade he was conversing through his bell-
topper :
The Premier’s reliance upon Sir John Lubbock’s attack
on the London County Council’s operations is a frail sup-
port. Over and over again Lord Avebury’s conclusions
have been challenged and confuted. The attack on
County Council finance and bookkeeping has lamentably
failed, the independent auditor appointed by the Coun-
cil’s critics having found in its favor. But, were it other-
wise, the failure of the London County Council would not
condemn advanced and business-like municipalism.
London is known to be the most backward of the great
municipalities of England. Glasgow, Birmingham, Liver-
pool, Manchester and others are shining examples of
success.
Then the Herald heaved this brick at Wade’s
own financial policy :
There are two matters which must be remembered in
considering this attack on English municipalism—a field
in which Great Britain is the envy of the world. The
first is that, though the debt is enormous, more than half
of it is reproductive and dividend-earning. Moreover,
the central Government of Britain has insisted on sinking
funds, and therefore it must be remembered that these
debts are being gradually extinguished. In this way
they are unlike the national debt of N.S.W., which is
apparently borrowed for ever, and is not repayable.
So that when the great English, Scottish and Irish
municipalities have repaid their debts, and have their
dividend-earning services free—like any other com-
mercial business—N.S.W., and other Australian States,
will be floundering along with a huge mill-stone of debt
around their necks.
Premier Jacky Evans announced the other day
that Tasmania hadn’t filled the vacant place on
the Bench caused by Justice Inglis Clark’s
death, and wasn’t going to do it for 12 months or
so, and probably not at all, “ with a view, of
course, to economy.” Premier Jacky went on to
say that, “owing to the congestion of business
consequent upon Justice Clark’s death,” the other
Judges had extra work, but they “would be
granted additional remuneration.” So, already,
though Justice Clark has been dead but two or
three months, business is admittedly congested ;
nevertheless Premier Jacky, who admits the con-
gestion, proposes to let things go on for 12 months
at least, paying the other two Judges overtime,
so as to encourage them to struggle with this con-
gestion somehow. Thus Jacky Evans handles
law and justice much as the sweating white-
work ' factory boss handles the etceteras of
his trade. Instead of paying three hands to work
at the factory, the boss pays two, who take the
rest of the work home with them, and “ run ’em
up” for three-ha’pence an evening. Just when a
Judge’s overtime starts or ends The Bulletin
can’t say off-hand ; presumably some rules of
court will be made on the subject. For a start, it
does seem a fair thing to count it as overtime if
Dodds, C. J., has to take Equity along with his
morning bath. Meantime, however, while Tas-
mania is paying its two Judges overtime, so as to
avoid the appointment of a third Judge, the great
Van Diemen’s Land Co. and the other big land-
owners who grow sheep (and very few of them)
are paying no land-tax. What between the con-
sequent dwindling of population and lack of
revenue, Tasmania has therefore to put up with
law laid down out of hours, and justice dispensed
by a Judge plodding along on overtime.

Caulfield (Melb.) Council traded away its tram-
way rights to Private Enterprise, and now the
usual trouble is coming home to roost. In the
boom days of 1888 the Council gave a 30-years’
lease of a tram route from Caulfield to Glen
Huntly and Elsternwick. The allegedly wealthy
shindykit that got the concession laid rails
and built two or three horse cars at a
cost of about £16,000; but it managed
its business so badly that in 1890 it was
glad to sell out for £5650 to another little
blossom of Private Enterprise. That flower
bloomed for a year or two, when the bank fore-
closed on its petals and nipped it in the bud, so to
speak. The bank slept over its acquisition for a
space and then put on a manager, who ran the
cars and collected his wages —and that was about
all. Next the bank persuaded still another
Private Enterprise co. to hold the infant, and it
got to work with the dilapidated cars on the worn-
out rails. All these years the different samples
of Private Enterprise had utterly neglected the
stipulated repairs to the roads, so the Council had
to touch them up hereand there. Finally, the Coun-
cil wearied of sending in the ever-accumulating bill
for repairs, and pushed the last co. into liquida-
tion, where it stops. Now the district is thickly
populated and the Council wants to run the
tramway, being sure it would pay with decent
management; but the company declines to return
the remaining 11 years of the concession it can’t
use, and says it is being robbed and that several
millions of capital are being driven out of the
country, or words to that effect. The Council has
asked Works Minister Cameron to cancel the
lease, but Cameron never does anything without
asking Bent, and Bent is busy with other jobs

“ J.G.” : The other day a lad of 16 was brought
into Eaglehawk (Vic.) in a battered condition. He
was a mass of bruises, some front teeth had broken
loose, a finger was smashed, and his clothes were
torn and blood-stained. The lad looked as though
he might have been run over by a train, or been
ploughed and harrowed ; but, as a matter of fact,
all that was wrong was that he had been reproved
on a kind cocky’s farm a few miles out. The
lad had been hired to the cocky, as a ward of the
State, for a bob or two a week; and ap-
parently the kid didn’t milk enough cows,
or something of the sort. These youngsters
are not always models, certainly ; and that is all
the more reason why the State supervision should
be strict. Instead, it is so lax that a system of
organised slavery has been introduced. During
the late harvest I saw wards of the State, hired
out in the first place to persons for a couple of
shillings a week, and then passed on to cockies,
who paid up to ss. a day for them. But instead of
the lads getting the 30s. a week, the kind people
who obtained them from the State pocketed 28s. a
week and gave the hired-out slaves the other 2s.

A few months ago Private Enterprise announced
that it was going to provide S. Australia with a
dry dock at Port Adelaide, big enough to accom-
modate all but the largest ocean-going steamers;
whereupon P. Enterprise stood on a pedestal and
invited the public to consider the great boon it
was conferring on the State; and P. Enterprise’s
newspaper showmen stood around and asked the
public to consider what a blessed thing it was for
a country to have Private Enterprise. Now,
however, the public has a chance to see the other
side of Private Enterprise. The capital put up
was £40,000, based on the assumption that
the job would cost about £25,000, with
£5OOO more for machinery and about £4OOO
for land. But the estimate was all wrong:
the lowest tender submitted for the work was
£34,275, and, as Rrivate Enterprise can’t see good
enough dividends in it at that price, the Dry
Dock Co. has decided to wind up and return
the £40,000. But it didn’t decide upon that before
growling bitterly at the high wages now ruling.
So really the Private Enterprise that stood on the
pedestal the other week turns out to be a concern
that wouldn’t be enterprising worth tuppence
except on the basis of big dividends and low wages.
Now, before long, there will be a demand that the
State shall undertake the job ; and when the State
does it, and probably shows a loss, Private Enter-
prise’s showmen will stand around and take
advantage of the dock, and meantime remark (as
Wade, of N. S. Wales, did the other day) that
Socialism manages things so shockingly that they
don’t pay.
♦
The Argus now tells what it wants :
A comparatively small, well-trained, thoroughly
equipped, and intensely mobile force would be infinitely
more effective for our purposes than a half-trained, badly
equipped, and practically undisciplined crowd, such as
the Ministerial conscripts would inevitably become.
It takes very good care, however, to shirk details.
It doesn’t go into the question of cost, for in-
stance. All it is sure of is that it must not be a
compulsory-service force. How will it be re-
cruited, then ? If by voluntary enlistment, it
will be necessary to fix the pay at rates above the
ordinary laborers’ wages, otherwise the men will
be constantly deserting—unless, of course, they
are kept locked up in fortified places, as
the Prussian army was in the 18th century.
That army, the best of its time, was recruited by
an organised system of kidnapping, and disci-
pline was maintained by the unsparing use of the
stick. Instead of pensions, disabled soldiers
were given licenses to beg. That was the Prussian
army of the great Frederick. When Napoleon
came on top he forbade Prussia to keep up a large
army, but the great Minister Stein, with
Scharnhorst, Gnkisenau, and others, supported
by popular feeling, contrived a system of compul-
sory training. This enabled them to pass great
numbers of men through the ranks, without keep-
ing more than the very limited number allowed
them bj' treaty actually serving at one time. It
was not conscription in the French sense, but
something infinitely more efficient, because it
allowed a comparatively small army to be rapidly
increased to three or four times its strength,
while a conscript army, with its long term of ser-
vice, has no reserve, like the landwehr, to increase
its strength in case of emergency. The French
generals were struck with dismay when, in 1813,
they saw landwehr men rising as if from the earth
to join France’s enemies, while France had no
trained citizen forces with which to meet them.
That’s the difference between conscription and
compulsory training.
Newcastle (N.S.W.) is the horse-leech’s offspring
and Oliver Twist, all in one. Coal is hauled by
the State, railways to the State-owned wharfs,
where Private Enterprise drags it away over the
State-dredged bar at the entrance to the harbor.
At present, Private Enterprise is set upon rushing
away more coal than usual ; consequently, there
have been delays to vessels, and Private Enter-
prise, still unsatisfied with the help it has had,
yells to the State to come along and do more. In
the harbor itself a whole bay has lately been
scooped out; at Carrington, new wharfs are being
built at State expense; the State railways have
spent large sums in deviations and new lines,
while £70,000 worth of new dumping machines are
on the way out. Also expensive alterations to
the dredge Jupiter have been carried out, to make
it fit to dig a more rapid way over the bar.
Altogether nearly half-a-million has been spent or
authorised lately. For all, or most, of this Private
Enterprise pays nothing. There is an Act of
Parliament imposing charges on vessels loading at
Government wharves, but in the long ago it was
abolished as far as Newcastle was concerned, and
the revenue that is collected can’t pay even the
interest on the money that has been poured out.
And then, after it has got all this and yelled for
more, more, more, Newcastle Private Enterprise
goes away with a smug countenance and votes
“ Down with Socialism ” !
New address : Robert Philp, Postal Vote
member for Out-of-Townsville (Q.).
Justice Owen, senior puisne Judge of
N. S. Wales, who retired last week at the age of
74 years, is a son of Colonel Owen of the 72nd
Highlanders, and a Dubliner by birth. He was
educated at Trinity College, Dublin ; was called
to the Irish Bar in 1859, and came Sydneywards
in ’6O. He was Chief Under-Secretary for a
couple of years, and then commenced on the
Equity side of the Court and built up a large
practice. In 1886, when he was on a visit to
England, Chief Justice Martin died, and Premier
Jennings cabled Owen an offer of the Chief Jus-
ticeship. But the cablegram didn’t find him, and,
after Julian Salomons had held the billet for a
troubled week, the appointment, on a second time
of asking, fell to Frederick Darley. Mr. Owen
became a Judge in 1887. After 20 years’service
he retires on a pension of £lB2O per year.
A curious cuss is the girl with a grievance
against the monster man ; and appalling are her
little ways. At Broken Hill, the other night, one
of her appeared suddenly in the main street,
clamant for “ a man in a straw hat.” (Someone,
it appeared, with straw head-gear had “deceived”
her.) As an immense revolver wobbled ominously
in the aggrieved one’s right hand, there was an
instant dive on the part of every adjacent deceiver
who had ever straw-hatted himself, for 3afe
obscurity. Thus it came about that half the male
portion of Broken Hill was couchant in ambush
within an incredibly short space of time. The
only policeman the town possesses who is able
truthfully to say (1) that he has never deceived
anyone, and (2) that he has not in all his life
hidden his thatch beneath a tile of straw, was
summoned and induced to advance persuasively
on complainant. She endured arrest, and was
taken to the lockup. There it transpired that her
revolver was old and defective, and had been
loaded the wrong way, and was otherwise harmless
save as a club or missile. But the state of the
revolver was a mere side issue. The really in-
teresting aspect of the case is that the girl, appa-
rently, didn’t call for her enemy by name, but
merely as a man with a straw hat. If that means
that she hadn’t taken the precaution to learn his
name before being “deceived,” her carelessness
was simply inexcusable. To be deceived is bad
enough, but to be deceived anonymously is most
unbusiness-like.

Consideration of “ Lured to London,’
the new Sydney Criterion show, does not induce
cheery optimism in regard to the future of the
local drama. As a play this is about the most
undistinguished that the faithful patron of stage
sensationalism has had to submit to hereabouts of
late years. It lacks the horrible originality which
marked “The Face at the Window,” “ Because I
Love You,” and the like ; and is less convincing
than “The Land of Gold ” —the which is a hard
saying. Redeeming features are the all-round
earnestness of the players, and a refreshing
dearth of sesquipedalian heroics on the part of
Carrington, the leading j uvenile. (This latter is the
more remarkable since Carrington is a parson—the
Rev. Leslie of that ilk—and “ A People’s Parson ”
at that.) Lill Sterling, daughter of an honest but
idiotic village carpenter, is the luree; her lurer
being Geoffrey Carrington, cousin of the Rev.
Leslie. The luring of Lill is really subsidiary to
the main motive of the piece. True, the lady’s trip
to London results (1) in further odium being
brought ultimately on the head' of Geoffrey, and
(2) in considerable blood-letting in connection with
the various attempts made to rescue her. But
that is all. So far as any lasting damage
goes, Lill might never have been decoyed a
yard from her native bailiwick. It does not
appear (despite her arrival in Act IV. wear-
ing the conventional black cowl, without which
the wardrobe of the repentant fallen one is
incomplete) that she has been “ruined.” Her
parents’ grey hairs remain unshamed. Of far more
urgency than the missing Lill is the missing Will.
The Will is lured away by one Jake, a burglar,
wherefrom arise most of the calamities that give
the play its interest.
* * * #
Rev. Leslie is accused of luring and several
other offences, and (despite his stout denial) en-
dures unfrocking, dishouselment, gnashing, or
whatever other indignity is put upon the modern
clerical suspect. Act III. finds him a figure of
pathos bereft of the shovel-hat that so well became
him, and clad in an unsuitably debonair
brand of straw head-gear. An upright but
weirdly incompetent policeman, P.-C. Coppard
(when was there ever a brainy stage P.-C. who had
pink hair and an Irish accent ?) also appears in
mufti immediately after the flitting of Lill and
the Will; and so remains till the end. The bur-
glar, Jake, whose comic make-up and quaint
enunciation indicate to the cognoscenti that he
has a good heart, and condone absolutely the
trifling facts that he is a blackmailer, robbery-
with-violence expert and other things, guards the
Will in his limelighted shanty by the Regent’s
Canal. Also, chained up somewhere in the O.P.
wings, he retains Lill. To the Jake shanty comes
Geoffrey in pursuit of Lill and the Will. Most of
the other characters follow and behave according
to their lights. Father Abe gets a richly-deserved
knock-out blow on the back of the head
from a life-preserver (he has perpetrated the
amazing foolishness of turning his back on
Geoffrey—a human armory—immediately after
felling that outrageous person to earth), and is
heaved into the canal. And now things begin to
go the way of the righteous. Lill is salvaged ; so
is the Will. Geoffrey becomes a penniless outcast
—a pariah. Rev. Leslie inherits “an estate
bringing in £5000 a year,” resumes his shovel hat
and halo, and announces his approaching marriage
to sweet Constance Stuart (Loyal and True).
P.-C. Coppard rejoins the force without a stain on
his character. All is well. The curtain falls
upon a scene of edifying joy.
* # # *
Max Maxwell does nicely as Leslie Car-
rington, and to the cleric’s rigid virtue Godfrey
Cass—the dreadful Geoffrey—presents a fine
counterfoil. J. P. O’Neill (Jake) and Merry
Lynch (Coppard) play character-parts for all they
are worth. Miss Harrie Ireland (Lill), a Bland
Holt favorite, compels tears and shrieks of
approval in nicely-balanced proportions; and
pretty Miss Katherine Brook succeeds as Con-
stance. Other notably well-filled rdles are
Rosannah Lovejoy (Miss Helen Fergus) and
Natty, a Slum-boy (Miss Buckley).

The advantage of one type of play is that
it does not unduly divert attention from the pro-
gramme ; and there are sometimes highly interest-
ing things on the programme. For instance, at
Sydney Royal, where “Claudian” is now being
played, the programme gives some valuable infor-
mation about “ The Language of Flowers” : —
Flowers may be combined and arranged so as to express
even the nicest shades of sentiment.. ..
“ I am ” is expressed by a laurel leaf twined around the
bouquet; “ I have,” by an ivy leaf folded together.
This is interesting, but hardly goes far enough.
“I am,” except as the pronunciamento of an
egoistic politician, has little practical value in
conversation. Can the laurel leaf be manipulated
in any way, or conjoined with a clove to express
“I am thirsty”—a very much wanted phrase in
the theatre, especially during the production of
turgid nonsense of the “ Claudian ” order? There
is more particularity in these interpretations : —
{I trust you will find con-
solation through faith, in
your sorrow ; be assured
of my unchanging friend-
ship.
The bouquet will be a little glaring in color
scheme, but one can imagine no more promising
sentence with which to begin a “mash ” of your
interesting-looking neighbor in the next seat.
There is a useful bit of language too in this :—
Columbine, Day Lily, Broken I Your folly and coquetry
Straw, Witch Hazel, and-! have broken the spell of
Colored Daisy b your beauty.
A broken straw can always be got at a squash
shop, and, except that the bearer of this bit of
flower talk would attract as much attention as

Spencer s Theatrescope, at Sydney Palace
is the sort of show that should be simply rushed
by lovers of melodrama. Whereas the usual
theatre gives one long-drawn-out show in one
night, bpencer reels off, perhaps, four or five, with-
out wasting time and filling in long scene-shifting
gaps with dreary conversation between two
alleged comic idiots. The figures rush on to
the canvas, tear through their parts, and
tucker off, and the scene changes from the
wild mountain gorge to the middle of the
Parisian drawing-room in the twinkling of an
eye. . Each series of pictures tells a story,
ror instance,, when the showman gives a race
between a train and an automobile, it is the dizzy
climax of a love yarn in which a scoundrel and a
pretty girl are racing to register a mine containing
millions, and the man who drives the automobile
is racing for the pretty girl. One of the finest
films this writer has seen is that which illustrates
a run on the Cairns-Mareeba (Queensland) rail-
way, and ends up with a magnificent set of views
of the superb Barron Balls. Mrs. Spencer focusses
her pictures so well that the whole theatre seems
to be sliding down the track at about 35 miles an
hour.

Boiled down to figures, Musgrove’s Ger-
man opera tour resulted like this
Net profit on performances mopped up.. .. £497
Subscribed capital absorbed .. .. 1908
Deficit to be made up by G. Musgrove .. .. 298
Total loss £2703
So the people who subscribed for shares lose all
their capital, and, of course, get no dividend—
and those who were wise didn’t expect any. As
a financial proposition the prospectus was a pretty
obvious joke, and probably nine-tenths of those
who took shares simply looked upon the sum
paid as a subsidy to Art. George Musgrove had
absolute control; he was in the happy position of
the man who fixes his own salary and allowances.
Therefore, though he can’t have done as well as
he deserved, his loss may not be as serious as it
looks on paper.

The new arrivals at Sydney Tivoli are
the Three Ounards and a Mr. Charles Dumont,
who has come all the way from Paris to teach this
country how to play Diabolo. The spinning of a
sort of reel on a string seems rather a trivial
proceeding to justify anyone in dragging a
man out of a far land and bringing him
at enormous expense across the ocean.
Mr. Dumont certainly spins his cotton reel, or
whatever it is, very nicely, but this paper—which
is cynical and bald-headed—confesses it feels in-
clined to adopt a hostile attitude when an
apparently respectable ratepayer tries to amuse
it by playing a nursery game in front of it for
several minutes. The Cunards —who are not a
line of steamships, but a trio of nimble young men
—have a smart step-dancing turn. The brilliant
Artois Brothers, Edwin Boyde, Alma Gray,
Ernest Leicester, Clarence Tisdale, and Herbert
La Martine are also among those present. The
Tivoli Ballarinas—who seem to have resigned
their old-time judicial attitude in the background,
and taken to mild gaiety—prance carefully round
a sort of illuminated maypole.

The panto, of “ Humpty Dumpty,” afc
Melbourne Her Majesty’s, is going strong for the
century, same as Armstrong did the other day.
Meantime King Solium asks pertinently, “ When
is a jester not a jester ? ” and replies to his own
question, “Nine times out of ten!” Nobody
seems to think it worth his while to deny the
charge. Barring the unforeseen, even the very
youngest jests of “H. Dumpty” will be 62 to-
night.

“ Camille,” at Melbourne Royal, has
offered no just cause or impediment towards the
alteration of last week’s views. As revealed by
Miss Mclntosh, the lady is individual and nicely
robust—the latter a quality midway between
feeble ness and histrionic convulsions. Even the
practice of “ flam,” which is sedulously cultivated
by the sex from the age of hair-pads on-
wards, is, in this case, pretty and becoming ;
only man, from innocence or exaggeration,
terms it finesse— the art of being rude to
general satisfaction. Naturally, Camille, with
a record like a variegated mat, would consider
finesse an artifice necessary to the preservation of
the status quo —the alliances between herself and
Armand and de Varville. But, in another re-
spect, she now appeals more generally to respect-
able mothers of large families. Now she mends
socks in Act 111. and, during the operation,
Pbdosophises to Gustave and Nichette, who chirp
eaven > which seems an incongruous, out-of-
the-way subject in that doll’s house, even with
the doll perishing on the premises. However,
the final struggles of the phthisical lady are timed

pewters, and homicidal implements, desperadoes
royster in sixteenth-century togs; and where
follows sudden death and gore. The flicker is a bit

Melbourne Opera House introduces some
new items this week. The most important is the
slab of Berntish roast beef, “ Sunshine,” served
by Miss Margaret Parker and Co. It is “a true
incident of London,” which concerns a female with
skirts to match her infantile innocence, and
a figure to match her 17 years, and a mature
contralto voice. Also it deals with a platonic
painter-chap and a longr-lost parent who
manufactures sewing machines. Apart from
the fact that Miss Parker sings a ballad
entitled “Daddy,” “Sunshine” is as irrelevant
as may be, and its acting is just ordinary. The
Biograph pictures of the first Weiss-Roberts
match on an oval table are worth 2s. 6d. a night
to any student of snooker. It’s a clear smooth
exposition of the exquisite in billiards. Martin
Henderson, who squeezes melody out of concer-
tinas, and the Eugenes, who dc some capital capers
in mid-air, are both edifying items. The sisters
Klos are to be withdrawn in the interests of another
community at the week’s end.
“The Squatter’s Daughter” is having
matters very much her own way at Adelaide
Royal, and the story of the young Australian hero
who had to keep on getting his life saved by a
girl continues to fill the Andersonian pocket.
The management, in its advertising, shows itself
a sound judge. It lays great stress on the
mechanical effects and mounting, and doesn’t
trouble to mention the authors or to say much
about the plot.
There is a satisfactory sincerity in Prime
Minister Deakin’s utterances on the Defence
question since he made the plunge and declared for
universal service. Public support, too. lias been
most encouraging. The people one meets seem
to acckiirn the idea, and the fact that the anti-
Australian press and Bruce Smith are antagonistic
is a most favorable sign.
An oppressed, shrinking young damsel —
Kay Lacey by name—charged “Skinny ” Lamb, at
Sydney Water Police Court, last week, with
assaulting and battering her. According to Ray,
Lamb grossly insulted her, where-'t she (hankering
for peace) ran swiftly and unobtrusively away.
But the ravening Lamb overtook her, she said,
despite her frantic efforts to be peaceful, and
struck her and otherwise behaved like a demon.
Then the defending solicitor took a hand, with the
following result: —
Solicitor: You have “ dealt it out ”to Lamb at times
haven’t you ?
Prosecutrix: Yes.
Solicitor : Have you stabbed him?
Prosecutrix : Yes.
Solicitor : A good many times ?
Prosecutrix : When he deserved it.
Solicitor : Have you stabbed him four or five times?
Prosecutrix : Yes.
Magistrate : Do you mean to say you have stabbed him
four or five times ?
Prosecutrix: Yes.
Magistrate: It is a wonder he is not dead.
Prosecutrix also admitted that she had struck Lamb on
the neck with a stone, and that she tore up his straw hat.
Solicitor : Did you strike your husband over the head
with something, and send him to the hospital ?
Prosecutrix : Yes.
Solicitor : What was it you hit him with ?
Prosecutrix : A knife.
Solicitor : Did you throw a cup at Lamb at a wedding ?
Prosecutrix: Yes.
And so on. Later Lamb told a tearful tale of a
ruined hat, and the assault charge against him was
dismissed. The magistrate didn’t ask for labored
testimony from Lamb or his friends. He seems
to have gone on the assumption that the man
who deliberately followed up a person like Ray,
once he had got her on the run, was a raving
maniac, and he released “ Skinny ” simply and
solely because, there being no signs of insanity
about him, he couldn’t have followed Ray.

The death of Luscombe Searelle (once called Scare-hell
by a South African paper), musical composer, is cabled
from England. He was 57 years of age at the time of his
passing out. Luscombe was the son of a Devonshire clergy-
man. When quite young he went to Maoriland, but at
14 years of age ran away to sea. In Maoriland and Aus-
tralia he was best known as a composer. Subsequently
he went to South Africa, and wrote bool;-., and became a
theatrical proprietor, and made money, which he lost
during the war. In ’O6 he went to Klondyice on behalf of
a syndicate. He had many alleged escapes in Smith
Africa, and was once, it is rumored, sentenced to death
for some political offence. Also, it is faintly alleged that
on another occasion his horse was eaten by a lion, he
being asleep up a tree—a strangely uncommodious and
perpendicular bunk. Luscombe Searelle made his first
appearance in Australia in the early’seventies at New-
castle, as pianiste to a small variety company, which in-
cluded an Italian with a troupe of dogs and monkeys.

Bulletin artists who imagine mines can be dug without
leaving any visible surface evidence in the shape of a tip.
In “ The Red Lamp ’’a set of revolutionists have dug a
mine, and from that a drive running out under a public
square. The mine is in a house in a suspected district in
the centre of St. Petersburg, subject to occasional raids
by the secret police, and yet the burrowings of the con-
spirators are not discovered. Of course the gifted author,
Outram Tristram, forgot all about the hundreds of cart-
loads of material that would come from such a tunnel;
and so does the audience, so it doesn’t matter much.
“JeanS.”: Out of seventeen characters in “The Red
Lamp ” (Melbourne Princess’s), eight appear for a few
minutes only—three in Act I ; one in Act II.; and four in
Act 111. They are accountable for mostly monosyllabic
conversation, lasting five minutes or so ; and they retire
for ever before they have assumed the significance of
entities. These personages present no visible apology
for worrying the spectator. They are dreary, un-
demonstrative ; do not argue or fight ; are, in every
sense, pacific in an atmosphere that promises any sort of
natural and unnatural convulsion every minute. The
women are well dressed joyless frumps. The men
are revoltingly dull. So there you are. And, talking
about another matter, why should Prince Alexis Valerian
require to give the password “ Russia ! ” before he may
enter the artistic “ dive ” of his Nihilistic friends, when,
funnily enough, any casual, such as Demetrius, the police
spy, Princess Marakoff, or Kertch, the servant, need only
bang heavily on the door ? Further, what is the virtue of
a drama that keeps everybody expectant of explosions
and demolition of the whole globe, and then finishes up
with a cheap, little, sickly, absurd Andersonian sensation
like the deaths of Valerian and Zazzulic (pronounced best
by opening a bottle of soda and letting it fizz), which
gentlemen pour their gore all over the pretty gold
furniture, and waggle expensive dancing-pumps in the
agony of sudden extinction ?

“ Nero ” : I have just read this in the.cabled report of
the Portuguese assassination : “The Queen rose in the

After that I wouldn’t be an assassin for £1 a week and

in the drama. For instance, the taunted heroine rises’
stands majestically over the leering villain (who has a
treacherous fly-paper concealed under his robe), then
whirling her posy aloft she brings it down with a crash on
his skull, and with a iwild cry he falls up dead, and his
mangled remains are afterwards found by the police on
the ceiling.
The moving-picture craze has culminated in a proposal
from a flickergraph showman to lease Sydney Town
Hall every night for six months that he may flicker there
continuously. It is to be hoped the City Council will
suppress the idea. The Town Hall belongs to the citizens
and no one man should have a lengthy monopoly of it!
Long before the six months expired the hall might be
"'anted for George Reid to lecture in favor
of Anti-Sosh ; .also it might be still more urgently
required for him to lecture against Anti-Sosh. Apart
from anything else, the cinematograph exhibition is
as dangerous a show as there is in the amusement
line, and an explosion in the Town Hall—explosions are
not infrequent elsewhere—might produce a holocaust.
Lgress from that building isn’t easy, and it is a bad place
for a panic. r
. The latest to advertise domesticity and the clingsome
infant is Miss Beatrice Day, of Herbert Flemming’s Co.
Miss Day told a Melbourne “ sassiety ” paper that, during
her last tour, mommer didn’t see her offspring for three
years ;so this time she has brought him with her. He
is ha nd y , and she can spring off to him at any moment.
Miss Day is amenable to the influence of colors. Some
repel or attract. Green, above all, distracts. Mr. Varna
stage manager for H. Flemming, has often requested her
to wear a green frock. But she would perish first. And,
of the beauteous simplicity of ’omelife, she is refreshingly
verbose. The artificiality of hotel life palls or does some-
thing! like that, and all is the Dead Sea vegetable. Of
course, her favorite part this tour is that of Olivia—so
sweet and domesticated, so redolent of the charm of the
ome, though, to be sure, Olivia g’lode away with a fleet
young man and became the subject of conversation and
of pa s mixed prayers and maledictions.
The most notable features about the break-
down of the Manly ferry-boat Brighton, on Satur-
day night, in Sydney harbor, seem to have been
these: —
(1) The boat was very old.
(2) It had something like 1200 people on board.
(3) When it broke down and drifted about in a most
dangerous part of the harbor, the co. seems to have re-
fused the offer of the pilot steamer Captain Cook to go to
the rescue. Anyhow, the Captain Cook didn’t go.
(4) There seemed to have been few strong hawsers and
many weak ones among the co.’s own boats that went to
the rescue, and the proportion of breakages and failures
was something lamentable.
(5) The co. was apparently too tired to ’phone the
tramway departments, and see if late trams were pro-
curable. Consequently when the mob of passengers were
landed about 1.30 a.m., after some four hours of muddle-
ment, they were shot helplessly into a sleeping city and
left to hustle.
Apart from these things, there seems to have been
little to complain of.

SOCIETY
PENFOLD'S
WINES
Ballarat makes very little progress at
clearing up the mystery of the Body in the Shaft,
which has beaten the Body in the Boot-box in
“ popularity.” When the medicos asserted that
the semi-skeleton found down the 16ft. shaft
must have been there at least three months the
’tecs smiled ; they had the evidence of those who
made the victim’s boots, hat, and clothes
that the articles found were Mrs. Graham’s,
and they had the date of her disappearance. The
pathologists asserted that a particular organ of
the body should have been discernible, and that, as
a matter of fact, it was absent. The ’tecs replied
that it might have been removed, for reasons, by
HAD AGAIN!— ALL THE FRONT
SEATS GONE.
those who placed the corpse where it was found.
Therein may lie the real solution of the question
why Mrs. Graham, leaving her lodgings to go and
visit friends, with a dress basket containing her
Sunday-best clothes and hat, should have
been subsequently found down a shaft,
dressed in those same best clothes, and with
the basket, the worn clothes, and some
of herself missing. The fact that there
were no hairpins in the head of the de-
ceased is held to suggest that she had
gone, to bed somewhere, and had been taken
from the bed, either dead or alive, and brought
to the place where the remains were found.
On the other hand, there are some
vague individuals who think they saw her
walking to the place in an ordinary sort of way
with a man. There are signs that the skull was
battered before the body was thrown into the
shaft, and there are gruesome theories that this
might have been done to a dead woman to make
it look like a case of plain out-door murder, and
prevent the police looking for a house where
a woman died' through an illegal operation.
On the other hand, the police have captured the
coffee-palace where a woman, who seems to have
been Mrs. Graham, slept the night before the
supposed date of the tragedy, and the coffee-
palace never heard of anj r curious happenings.
The requests of the ’tecs that Mrs. Graham s best
boy, William lies, should happen along to assist
them are more seductive than effective. An
amazing side issue is that, though it is
lies called at Mrs. Graham’s address at 10.30 on
the evening when she finally left, a Mrs. Young
and several other witnesses swear that he spent
the hours from 8 p.m. till 3 a.m. in Mrs. Young s
back parlor. For a young man who has been on
friendly terms with at least two attractive widows
.—grass and genuine—lies seems to have suddenly
become of a very retiring nature. Anyhow, it is
a most absorbing mystery, and Ballarat has tem-
porarily forgotten the absence of mining divi-
dends in worrying out the pros and cons.
* * * *
The detectives plainly made a mess of
their work in connection with the dead woman
found down a Ballarat shaft. They were informed
of William lies’ relations with the dead woman a
few days after the discovery of her body. There
was certainly no proof of his having any con-
nection with the murder, but he should have been
hunted up at once ; yet it was 10 days before the
police learnt that a passage had been booked by
the Grantala to “ the West ” in the name of lies.
After they had wasted more time in inquiries in
this direction, they discovered that the passage
had been booked while lies was still. in
Ballarat—possibly it had been booked as a blind.
Moreover, three days after the identification of
the body, Mrs. Young, the Ballarat widow whom
lies had promised to marry, said that a stranger
called and told her to meet him that evening at a
quiet corner and he would tell her where lies was.
She kept the appointment, with her 14-year-old
daughter as company, .and the man passed but did
not speak. She was such a simple, trusting soul
that it didn’t occur to her to follow him; she
merely waited another hour—vainly, of course.
The ’tecs ought to have taken an interest in that
man. m
Last week four words, written into an
information laid against a Newtown (Sydney)
publican, made Gold Tea gnash its teeth, and
throw itself about like a flurried octopus. The
publican was charged with selling “food, to wit,
whisky,” which wasn’t what it should have been.
It was the idea of blue ruin being officially de-
scribed as “ food ” that broke up Cold Tea and
Co.

“Hamer” : The drunks’ train that leaves
Sydney at midnight is a triumph in State
benevolence. The railway officials search the
station for all the odd, or unassorted, or bulk
drunks who have stowed themselves
away in corners, and escort them
tenderly to the vehicle. Occasionally
they escort someone who didn’t want
to take the train, but just happened
into the station because it was there,
but that is unavoidable. Then, just
as everyone seems nicely settled,
there is a rush of about a score of
people on to the station, and the
train waits whilst the tender officials
help them aboard. The drunks’
train officials always appear to me as
the Florence Nightingales of the
railway service. The steam caravan
stops at every station, and every
passenger is awakened and asked if
it is his station, which it mostly isn’t.
This is a lengthy business, but time
is no object. The atmosphere of the
drunks’ train is a sleepy one, and
nearly everyone goes to sleep. Even
a belated cavalier leans his head on
the shoulder of his fair partner.
When I had been wakened for the
sixth time, the last time I caught the
drunks’ train, I was alarmed to notice
that the movements that usually sent
me to sleep again didn’t re-coinmence.
I got out and walked along to a com-
partment that seemed to be the centre
of some commotion. It held an un-
dressed drunk who, with the help of
the porter, was struggling into his
trousers. He had imagined himself
at home, and had gone to bed, and
he delayed the train for five minutes. Yet on
Monday he was holding forth in the car against
State interference. And only 48 hours pre-
viously he had depended on the State to find
his pants.

The bottled oyster has had his character
violently aspersed of late, and unless he is pre-
pared to rush into litigation and clear himself, it
will probably take him a long time to live down
the cloud that has fallen upon him. It is alleged
that the person who hawks the bottled fish has a
dreadful habit of hunting in ash-barrels and rub-
bish tips for his bottles, and that his ideas about
cleaning and disinfecting them are primitive. He
just finds his bottle, dashes it into water if its
condition is very bad, doesn’t dash it at all if its
aspect is fair to middling, and shoves in the
oysters. Then the trusting human eats them,
and, when the angel of death hits him square on
the stomach,, wonders why.
In spite of Judkins and rampant Cold Tea,
there are some Maoriland towns that don t hang
far behind the droughtiest parts of Australia in
the matter of pub population. Kumara borough,
where King Richard came from, has 12 licenses
to moisten 919 people—one license to every 77
throats-and Ross, with 580 people, has seven
places where you may ask for the same again,
please. But Invercargill, with the other Inver-
cargill boroughs, representing 11,783 people in all,
is as dry as the Devil’s boots.
THE ANTI-THEATRICAL MOVEMENT.
“ I went to the theatre last evening, and, believe
me, I saw nothing I could object to.”
“ Indeed. Did you ask for your money back?”
“Stony”: Private Enterprise, however
much it may spread itself to cater for the wants
of the travelling public, still has a great deal to
answer for to the unhealthily-quartered men of
its mercantile marine. One of the latest boats on
the Australian coast, although up-to-date in
passenger and other accommodation, and in
devices for the traveller’s comfort, is a galley-
slaver in the matter of its ordinary seamen’s
quarters. There, in a cabin about the size of a
cheap hotel bedroom, some 12 men are housed,
and there they sleep, feed, dress and lounge.
Things are certainly better at sea than they used
to be in the weevil days of yore, but this is mainly
because the owners have been pushed. They
didn’t go of their own free will; and they will
require a good deal more pushing before the
ordinary seaman is treated as anything but the
hog which he is not. The Australian people, at
least, should look after the men who work along
their own shores, however the stout, conservative
gentlemen of dear old England fail in their
duty to those of their free British brothers
who go down to the sea in smellful snips infested
with cockroaches.

The difference, from a race point of view,
between the white and the colored man was pic-
turesquely shown at the recent London scientific
pow-wow on plague. Two of the world’s ex-
perts read papers—Haffkine (Indian experi-
ence), Ashburton Thompson (Sydney experi-
ence). Haffkine’s note throughout was one
of pessimism. Rats couldn’t be exterminated
and couldn’t be kept out of the homes ; the
best device for fighting the plague was in-
oculation, which reduced the mortality 85 per
cent. That was a true view dealing with
colored races living in hovels. To make the
hovel of the Hindu earning eightpence a day
rat-proof is obviously an economic iinpossi-
bility. Ashburton Thompson had a different
tale to tell, of the plague breaking out in a
white community and being sturdily met
and practically defeated by rendering the
habitations of man inaccessible to rats.
England hates to abolish anything. All
the old more or less useless billets that have been
accumulating along the course of its history are
religiously preserved and given to staid, common-
place Britishers who have influence at Court.
One of these ancient jobs is that of Ulster King
at Arms. The holder of the office is supposed,
among other heavy duties, to guard the State
regalia in Dublin Castle, and, as it seems a yawn-
ing, tiresome job, one can hardly blame the King
at Legs for getting sick of it and going off to bed—
which he must have done, for some blackguard got
in lately and stole several of the baubles. A solemn
Commission sat on the case, but the only thing it
hatched was a remark that the Emperor at
Stomach couldn’t have exercised proper care. The
accused wassodem’d tired and felt solittle curiosity
concerning it that he didn’t even trouble to drop
in while the Commission was sitting—just read
the report in the dem’d papers as if it was a dog-
fight. Anyhow, he lost his job.
Having got the Wallace divorce case off
its mind, and given up the Ballarat corpse in
the mine as a bad job, part of Melbourne satdown
last week to consider a matter of great moment
and immense tonnage. Two eminent and expen-
sive barristers, instructed by two expensive firms
of solicitors, argued for two whole days before a
learned and expensive Judge, after which his
Honor observed that there were but two wit-
nesses, and they emphatically contradicted each
other, so plaintiff would be non-suited. And all
this yabber, not to mention about two columns of
the little ’Erald, was over a common, ordinary
fight between two half-bred dogs, in which one
(value, ss. or less) was killed.

“The Listener ” : In these days of unions,
associations, leagues, and other swindles for pre-
serving secretaries from suicide and office-boys
from the Children’s Court, why not a
League for the Suppression of Louts ? One
sees the unspeakable animals everywhere.
To vary the Psalmist’s wail: “Whither
shall I go from thy spirit, O Lout, or
whither shall I flee from thy presence ? If
I ascend into the mountains (via Hornsby,
at greatly reduced holiday fares) thou art
there ; if I pitch my Matilda on the plain,
behold, thou art there ! If I take the
wings of the morning (H.M.S. Kirribilli
from Mosman, first boat) and fall into the
train at Central to the uttermost parts of the
Ma-State, even there shall The Lout be.”
He is indeed everywhere. The peaceful
upper reaches of the beautiful rivers, where
one was erstwhile wont to journey a-boat
with one’s best girl, are now mere bathing-
pools for his unutterable half-nude majesty.
Where the respectable taxpayer desires but
to hear the singing of birds and the buzz of
the honey-getters, he hears the vocabulary
of the larrikin. His face is a faithful
index to Darwin’s philosophy. His fore-
head is low, eyes vacillating and vicious.
In a clean, young, vigorous country he
is an anomaly and a paradox. Mean-
time, Breadwinner, his squaw and pro-
geny, are less and less inclined to journey
forth where the sun shines and sweet,
green water magnifies the brown rocks.
The Lout is in possession of Sydney’s
choicest haunts, and Breadwinner elects
to remain at home, and trim the lawn
with bis wife’s best scissors, and wash
the dog. Therefore I assert that a League
for the Suppression of Louts would do well,
each member sworn to attack the Lout in his
weakest part and kick him something incredible.

For a country that, according to some
people, can’t do anything, the number of things
Australia contrives to do better than many other
countries is remarkable. Recently, contractors
C. R. McKenzie and Co., who do a lot of work
for the N.S.W. Government, wanted an extra big
drill for wharf and similar construction, and, in
the natural order of things, tried to procure it
from abroad. The omnipotent foreigner couldn t
supply one large enough. Then the Horsefield
(Bendigo, Vic.) foundry came to the rescue, and
turned out what is said to be the biggest machine
of its kind in the world. It is 18 inches in dia-
meter, intended to bore 30 or 40 feet under water,
and weighs a ton and a quarter. Experts have
tested the colossal gimlet and pronounced it Al.

Three hundred guests attended.
The bride and bridegroom received £250,000 worth of
presents, all of which were placed under glass .... The
count, who is 28 years of age, received a gift.of £1,000,000
on the day of the wedding, but it is so held in trust that
he can use only the interest.—Daily paper.
When a lady espouses a count or a king
It’s a hundred to one he’s an ass,
So, to keep him intact, he is carefully packed—
Like the presents—and put under glass ;
And his salary stops if he later on hops
With a hussy who dances and sings,
For the lord so adored when he feels rather bored
Is inclined to forget wedding rings
(Stupid things!),
For a creature who does Highland flings.
The cute heiress in white is a girl of the world,
So —to make sure no sirens encroach —
She takes care she remains where she handles the reins
On the old matrimonial coach ;
Then she drives it with grace at a good steady pace —
Leaving room for the hansoms to pass —
With a sweet, dimpled smile, for she knows all the while
She has got the young man under glass
(Golden glass !),
Safely pinned like a moth under glass.

Lancelot Dawson, skipper of the Taiyuan,
found himself in a curious strait last week. On
hoard his vessel was a Chinaman named Ying
Coon, and the Customs informed Dawson that if
Coon landed in Australia he (Dawson) would be
fined £lOO. Ying also talked law to the skipper,
mentioned Habeas Corpus, Magna Charta, and
the Riot Act, and spoke about an action for £lOOO
for trespass, barratry, and jettison. Ying’s argu-
ment was that he was a Victorian born and bred.
His father was Goon Ming, his mother Winifred
Minahan, and he was born in 1877 at Emerald
Hill. He also remarked he had been 26 years in
China. He couldn’t explain how he came to be
called Ying Coon, couldn’t produce his birth cer-
tificate, couldn’t even produce Emerald Hill. The
Customs, therefore, regarded his tale with disdain.
In despair Captain Dawson took his troubles before
Justice Street. The Customs didn’t argue the
matter, not wanting to keep the ship here indefi-
nitely, and the Judge ordered the harassed mariner
to let Ying go at once. Dawson, overjoyed,
hurried back to his ship and told Coon to go to
the Devil, or words to that effect. Then a police-
man captured Coon ashore on a charge of being a
prohibited alien, and the Emerald Hill story is to
be carefully investigated.

Remarks London Daily Express :
The American has a perfect craze for talking about
everything. He talks about accuracy and speed, while
the Englishman stolidly goes ahead. He puts up tablets
on every wall bearing the legend “ Do it now,” and while
he is driving in the nails to hold the tablet the English-
man does the job. He indulges in “ quick lunches,” in-
vites dyspepsia, and then spends more time in talking
about how quickly he has lunched than the time spent in
eating.
THE MISTAKE.
NEW TENAT: "‘Look here,
you'll have to make some alteration in this place. It's not fit for a pigsty.”
LANDLORD : “I didn’t know yer wanted it fer a pigsty. I thought yer wanted it ter live in."
‘ D. : I stood in one of our parks last
week and watched two youths of the shop-hand
class try not to fight each other. Truly, the way
of a man with one he doesn’t want to fight—but in
regard to whom he finds it necessary, for honor’s
sake, to assume bloodthirstiness—is
a pathetic circumstance. In the
case under notice everyone, barring
the two principals, was fairly pant-
ing for the fray. A consumptive
lad with a weakly gleaming eye
hissed in. the ear of the smaller dis-
putant: “’lt ’im, I sy; ’it ’im.
’E called yer a Sosherlist. Ain’t
that enough ?” But the other
turned harassedly upon his goader.
“Let ’im say it again,” He urged.
“Only oncet again. That’s all I
arsk.” The consumptive’s voice
rose to a suppressed scream. “But
’e’s said it twice already. ’Ow
many more ? ” Of a sudden there
was a smack, and the insulted one
reeled, smitten in a sore place. His
enemy had found further resistance
to the blood-lust of his supporters
hopeless. The injured one pranced
in anguish. “Ho!” he wailed.
“ Lem me alone ; lemme get at ’im.”
No one offered to stop him. On
the contrary. Falsely secure, the
smiter now walked deliberately up,
and again struck his outraged
acquaintance in the neighborhood
of the left eye. The blow let out
fear, diffidence, or whatever senti-
ment had been rendering the other
innocuous. He became a gyrating
thing of arms and teeth. His op-
ponent fell back in amaze. He
glanced around him wildly, as
though seeking succor. A bony
anaemic fist shot against the side of
his nose. Straightway he lay (not
fell) down, holding a trembling
hand to his injury. With foot up-
raised the other stood near him,
prepared to kick ; but the onlookers
intervened. This ended the first
round. Two more like it followed,
the most futile I have ever wit-
nessed. I then left in a bored
state, carrying with me a friendly feeling for
Billo of Fivedock and his friend Erb, to whom
stoush is a solemn rite, and a thing that may in
no way be trifled with.

It lias been reserved for a Haw-Hawthorn
(Vie.) municipal ass to show how ratepayers
should be treated. Hawthorn residents pay the
comparatively high rate of Is. 9d. in the £, and,
like fools, expect corresponding benefits. They
have horse-trams, and yet they want electric
cars. Their streets are well-grassed, yet they
clamor for asphalt. Even in the hot weather the
Council employs as many as a man and a boy to do
the daily grind, and to pick up the decayed
banana skin and the errant dog. The ratepayers
ask what becomes of their money, and when the
councillors scratch their collective head in council
assembled, the Mayor rises in dignity and says,
waving the atmosphere from him in a large way —
“ Gentlemen, gentlemen, surely you are not going
to take this seriously.” Surely not! When a
municipality takes criticism seriously, and really
buckles down to hard graft, we can expect any-
thing.
The Melbourne police have wearied them-
selves inquiring into another Mystery of a Hansom
Cab. Soon after midnight on Jan. 28, in the
middle of the lonely Dynon-road, that runs from
North Melbourne to Footscray, a senior John,
going his rounds, found a horse lying dead between
the shafts of an overturned hansom cab. The
lamps and windows were broken, and inside the
cab were a lady’s silver belt, a half-smoked cigar,
and a couple of hatpins. Both driver and “fares”
were missing. The senior John prospected for
clues, but could find none. Mystified, he went to
the station and telephoned neighboring and
city watchhouses, and finally the hospitals; but
nobody knew anything. Then, through the vehicle’s
number, the owner was hunted up, but could
only say that the driver —a regular employee—
had taken the turn-out from the stables in Fitzroy
the previous afternoon. Later on a message came
from the Melbourne Hospital that a man who had
been brought in unconscious carried a cabby’s
license bearing certain numbers. That informa-
tion identified him as the missing driver, but left
the police as much in the dark as ever as to what
happened on that lonely swamp road, how the
unconscious cabby got to the hospital, how the
“fares” fared, or who they were, or how they got
away so mysteriously. At time of writing, the
mystery was no clearer, for the driver was still
unconscious, and nobody had turned up to claim
the silver belt. The owner of that belt possibly
doesn’t want to explain how she came to be driv-
ing in a hansom, along with a half-burnt cigar,
at one in the morning.

The crowd that runs the Gippsland coal
mines is trying a new trick. Five years ago it got
to loggerheads with the Coal Miners’ Association,
and starved that body to death, and filled the
mines with non-unionists. Gradually the non-
unionists began to see that they had been extra-
sized fools, and, after being reduced to something
not far from starvation, they combined under the
Commonwealth Arbitration Act. The owners
tried to prevent registration, on the ground that
Gippsland wasn’t in two States; but they had
Justice Higgins to argue with, and the union was
allowed to go on the roll. Now, as they couldn’t
beat it by assault, they try to undermine it, and
the Victorian Colliery Owners and Employees’
Federation is established—a nice, friendly concern
“to promote harmony between capital and
labor” (the same trick, by the way, as the
“Machine Shearers Union of N.S.W.” The
promotion of justice isn’t mentioned. There
are a lot of households like that—house-
holds in which there are never any rows, because
the old man cheats the missus into submission, or
long ago bashed her into the same state.
The League of Ancient Mariners Ijad a
picnic last Saturday at Middle Harbor, Sydney.
The daddy mariner of the crowd was Captain
Charles, M.L.C., who will be 90 next August.
Captain Bremner is trending that way, and
Capt. A. S. Murray is aged 80 years. Capt.
Murray claims to be the oldest shipowner
hereabouts, as he had a vessel of his own
in 1849. He visited California in it, so he is one
of the very few Forty-niners left in Sydney.
Capt. Murray is well known to tourists as the boss
of the stern-wheel steamer, General Gordon,
which used to do the Hawkesbury pleasure trips.
The General Gordon was the connecting-link be-
tween Peat’s Ferry and Mullet Island before the
Hawkesbury bridge was imported by Protectionist
George Dibbs.

“ 10-2-4 ” writes :
One Hudson writes to the S. M. Herald (7/2/’08) clamor-
ing that Coogee—-abhorred at present of the righteous—
shall “ be made like Margate and other seaside places in
the Old Country.” One wonders if Hudson has ever seen
Margate the Awful, and, if so, what sort of a patriot he is,
anyway, that be should hanker to transform a pleasant
and picturesque Sydney suburb into the semblance of one
of the most dreadful spots the “ old country ” boasts.
Margate’s main thoroughfare, “ The Front,” looks upon
a cold gray sea. On a grimy, inadequate beach, ribbed
with black drain pipes, swarm the people who make the
town the fairly prosperous place it is. Just clear of the
sluggish ripple that laps the wet sands stand in hundreds
the bathing boxes of Old England, practically unchanged
since the days of Leech. From these emerge at intervals
men and women in a burlesque form of bathing dress.
They do not swim. Hardly any but a Oavill could
actually swim in the outrageous get-up these people affect.
For a few minutes they bob up and down very cautiously
in the water, with hands joined, and then re-enter their
smelly boxes shudderingly, and dress.
The bathers at Margate, Ramsgate and other places of
the sort form a negligible fraction of the populace. In
his heart the Britisher who goes down to the sea in an ex-
cursion train despises the bather; reckoning him a crank
and a notoriety-seeker, and a person who wantonly lays
himself open to catching cold. Margate’s real attraction
is to be found under the sea-wall which circles “ The
Front.” Here, amid the acrid odor of drain pipes, orange
peel and beer, cluster the entertainers. Their “ pitches ”
are at intervals of from 10 to 35 yards. Nigger minstrel
troupes howling in chorus the latest and “ hottest ”
Marie Lloyd song; Pierrots with a harmonium
and a repertoire ranging from the “Holy City’
to “ Gor’ Save ” ; gramophones (about 15 of
which go to the mile); clog-dancers, who thunder
upon boards especially laid on the sand; heavily-
masked singers, whose horrible voices are only endured
patiently by the beach frequenters on the understanding
that their owners are broken aristocrats in disguise—all
these fill every available inch of the strand. Above their
din sounds the crashing notes of the steam merry-go-
round from the Hall-by-the-Sea end of the town, and the
joyful shrieks and howls of ’Arry and ’Arriet, who have
come down from London for the day, and become alcohol-
smitten on the road.
You will hear more foul language on any summers
morning at Margate than in a week at Coogee. You will
observe a finer collection of drunks (male and female)
between the pier and the town railway station on any
given Saturday in July or August than in Coogee, Bondi,
Bronte, and Manly Beach combined during the hottest
of our Australian hot weather. Were Judkins to board
London-bound Chatham and Dover or South-Eastern train
on a Sunday night during the English summer he would
swoon with joy at the huge field for social reform that he
would see open before him. There are many foolish-
nesses this unhappy old country has been urged to copy
from the “ old country,” but Margate is the limit.

“Poneke”: “Determined Suicide” is a
common enough headline in newspapers. I have
often wondered how any genuine case of deliberate
self destruction can be anything but “deter-
mined,” but few are so extraordinarily determined
as one which occurred at New Plymouth (M.L.)
the other day. A man blew himself up with such
determination that it was a matter of exploration
to discover the corpse. An arm was found in one
street, an ear in another, and sundry fragments
were scattered around, and what was left of the
trunk was near by where the explosion eventuated.
Some sort of identification was arrived at
through the discovery of a collar bearing the name
of a townsman who is not to be found in the flesh.
Talking of severed ears reminds me that one time
on a Napier (M.L.) racecourse a man was watch-
ing a race from the outer rails near the winning
post. He was backing a rank outsider. The
rank animal won, and, fleeing to the totalisator to
collect the dividend, he attempted to cross the
track before the field had passed. The last horse
—Spade Guinea it was —came along and kicked
his ear clean off ! In a few minutes the backer
was carrying about a pot of money in one hand
and an ear in the other.

A male Goth (presumably if he were a
female he would be a Gothess) sends this from
Launceston (Tas.)
Arrived in Hobart with the Fiji cricketers. Marvellou
the excitement in the apple port. The ladies were
delighted, particularly those at the Carlton Club Hotel.
The hostelry being fairly full, they jammed all Fiji in
one room about 14 x 16. Fiji seemed happy.
Kadavu Levu attends the local clubs, plays billiards,
etc., and generally endeavors to keep up the dignity of
Fiji; but Ratu Pope Seniloli is the ladies’ man. On
Tuesday evening three ladies, two of fair tonnage, were
leaving in a brougham for the railway station. Ratu
Pope Seniloli, attired in his short shirt and walking stick,
jumped in with them, tucking his cocoanut-oiled legs
and feet amongst their frills. His bass broom head
looked a picture alongside the feathers as they drove
away. He came back with one female only, and as they
left the hotel again to continue the drive, one of two
astonished girls on the footpath exclaimed “Great
Scott! Is she by herself?” 1 saw them return at 10
p.m. Seniloli paid the cabby in a proud spirit with
money which he extracted from somewhere in the
vicinity of his oiled leg. I went to bed in disgust.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
There are several ways of driving capital out of
the country, and some of the people who have rayed
most against the Labor party for doing it have adopted
far more powerful methods of doing the same thing' them-
selves. In connection with several reconstructions after
the financial crisis of the early ’nineties, horrible frauds
were perpetrated. People were encouraged to lend those
concerns money on debentures and otherwise, on the
strength of uncalled capital standing in the names of
solid people ; yet, as soon as the concerns got into further
trouble, those solid people began to shuffle out of
their liabilities, and, in one or two cases, were
cunningly able to actually influence legislation to
help them in doing so. The debenture-holders in most
cases were English, Scotch, and other outside capitalists
the very people whom we are warned we must not scare.
Yet hundreds of those people believe (and have good
reason to believe) that rich, anti-Socialistic Australians
played the confidence trick on them and swindled them.
Wherefore they will have no more to do with Australia.
The last case that has happened isn’t altogether
like some of those old ones, but it has some points
of resemblance, and is bad enoug'h. W. and A.
McArthur and Co., the old Sydney wholesale firm,
was formed into a limited liability co. in 1898.
The vendors took £150,000 in ordinary shares.
At first the British public subscribed £75,000 ; but later
on it put up another £lOO,OOO. And the public was un-
questionably encouraged, if not induced, to put up this
extra money by the action of the vendors (ordinary share-
holders) in also taking up 10,000 ordinary shares, paid to
£l, and liable for another £9. The holders of the ordinary
shares controlled the business ; and the British public
said that the thing was good, or these people who knew
wouldn’t take on a liability of £90,000. Now, however,
the official receiver announces that he doesn’t hope to be
able to get that £90,000.
Of course there is a row. A man who put his
money into this Australian concern wrote recently to the
London Financial Times “To add to the misery, we
are told that calls upon the McArthur family for their
unpaid liability will be useless. When £lOO,OOO of extra
preference shares were issued about six years ago pari
passu with the existing shares, it was held out as an in-
ducement that the directors would subscribe for an equal
amount of ordinary shares. We now see the meaning of
such collateral subscriptions. When the preference shares
commenced to fall in value, I thought of selling out and
cutting my loss, but refrained when I examined the share
list, and saw the security of the directors’ uncalled
capital. Now, we are coolly told by the liquidator
that such calls cannot be reckoned as an asset. ..
A cable a day or two ago said that the liquidator
“ had issued a call on four directors of the old co. for
£90,000, but he did not believe that he would realise any
substantial sum.” If the McArthurs and McMillans
haven’t got the money, then certainly the liquidator
can’t get it either, but that won’t make things
any better for Australia. Yet no doubt when,
a few years hence, somebody draws attention to
the fact that a certain amount of foreign capital has been
withdrawn from Australia, the same old tale will be told
—the foreign capitalist was scared out of Australia by the
Labor party, or Sosh, or something of that kind. The
part that the McArthurs and the McMillans have played
in the driving-out process will be carefully forgotten.

The position is not very clear. Six months ago there was
a deficit of £172,449, less £6402 made up of various
balances and some forfeited capital, etc., leaving £166,047
of a net deficit. That net deficit has now been wiped out
and a contingency account of £29,901 created ; total of the
two items, £195,948. But from the maze of forfeitures and
surrenders of shares at various stages it can be vaguely
made out that rather more than that was written off, so
apparently a little of what was at first put into con-
tingency account may have been since wiped out. Any-
how, it doesn’t matter much. The present situation is
that only 146,622 shares remain, paid to £1 instead of the
recent £2 75., and liable for another £llos. (Part of the
£1 is represented by calls not yet paid on all shares ; the
actually paid capital is £113,567).
The following comparison shows the foregoing
and some other movements :

Cash, etc. .. 29,392 74,054 128,188 38,798
There is also a paper asset—discount on calls paid in
advance, £24B9—which ought to have been wiped out in
the cleaning-up process. The fact that it was left sug-
gests that the operation hasn’t been any too thorough.
The debentures have been heavily reduced, mainly by re-
ducing the cash balance accumulated in the previous
half-year. The properties sold for the six months
had a book value (as reduced) of £21,170 ; but how the
transactions have panned out can’t be said definitely.
The gross income for the half-year was £11,490, equal to,
say, £4 19s. per cent, per annum on the book value of
assets as at December 31. Debenture interest, as well as
upkeep and management, has to be met out of this, so
there is small margin for profit. Fortunately the man-
agement expenses are very moderate. The advances are
considerably more than double the value of properties in
hand ; and, with good management, the proportion of
advances will be strengthened. At present, advances,
plus liquid assets, exceed the whole of the debenture and
other debt, leaving for shareholders the properties in
hand. That, of course, assumes that 20s. of advances as
written down will pay off £1 of debt. But it is a melan-
choly business, for all that. Of 250,000 shares only 146,622
are alive ; and from £5 they have been written down to
£2 10s. ; while the debenture-holders, for a great part of
the years since the smash, have been pulling along on 3£
per cent, interest.

Nothing is hinted at to explain the slump in profits. The
profit and loss account shows the revenue in a lump,
“ after providing for contingencies.” In the past half-year
the revenue, after making that unknown provision, was
£4806 ;in the preceding half-year it was £6150. Possibly
the variation arises from the manner (also unknown) in
which the Commission on the capital value of estates
(likewise unknown) is treated. The directors give hardly
any information about anything. The paid capital is
£25,000 ; the uncalled capital is £lOO,OOO. The total liabili-
ties to the public are only £99. All the capital is therefore
available to ensure the due fulfilment of trusts ; none is
safeguarding the investment of borrowed money. Of the
assets, £24,239 is in public stocks ; the reserves are in
premises (£15,962), outstanding commissions, etc. The
table printed above starts with the first 8 per cent. div. ;
for four years before that 7Jper cent, per annum was paid ;
before that again, 6 per cent. The business, so far as the
published figures enable one to judge, is very profitable ;
capital and reserves combined earned £l5 4s. 6d. percent,
last year. For the past half-year alone, in spite of the
slump, the profits work out at the rate of £lO 18s. per
cent, per annum.

If, however, the dividend is calculated on the capital
actuallv paid (£140,000), it is equal to £l2 11s. 3d. per
cent., instead of 11 per cent. The profit and loss account
is inadequate. “Manufacture, depreciation, etc., are
lumped into one item. How much “ depreciation ”
stands for, and what “ etc.” consists of, are not
suggested. Apparently, however, “ etc.” means repairs
and renewals, among other things. Anyway, reserves
of all sorts totalled £i6,967 six months ago, and the total
additions to reserves for the past six months were £2651,
so the aggregate is £19,618; and as the reserves now
stand at that figure, it is clear that nothing has
been paid out of these reserves—for renewal of
meters, retort beds, etc. Yet though depreciation is
apparently allowed for, it seems as though the re-
serves are, in part at any rate, cover for special
depreciation. As before mentioned, it is impossible to
tell what amount is put aside out of revenue to provide
for general depreciation ; it may be hidden by being put
into new plant, mains, etc. It does not, however, look as
though very much had been done in that way. Five years
ago the assets totalled £183,957, and the gross revenue
was £22,056 for the half-year, or £23 19s. per cent. The
assets are now £205,451, and the gross revenue is
£24,923, or £24 ss. p.c. That shows an improvement, and
suggests that some extensions of mains, etc., may have
been paid for out of revenue to cover the depreciation of
old mains; but the improvement i 3 very small. The
cash position is strong. Take a comparison :

Some years ago the co. sold a block of land to the Bris-
bane City Council, and made a good bargain. Five years
ago £24,000 was owing on this transaction (this debt
is" included in the liquid assets above); all has now
been paid off but £4OOO. On the other side is a suspense
item—“ Land: Suspense account for Dividend Reserve
Fund, £5100,” and for all practical purposes this may now
be added to the reserves shown in the first table above.

The amounts shown above as written off have been spent
on the renewing of retorts, and don’t cover general
depreciation. There is apparently some provision for
this general depreciation, but it is lumped into one item
in this way— “ Manufacture, depreciation, etc.” How
much is written off is never mentioned; whatever
revenue is applied to the purpose is put into new plant,
mains, etc. At December, 1903, this item—“ plant, land
and buildings ’’—stood at £77,352 ; and the gas sales, etc.,
that half-year brought in £7438, or at the rate of
£l9 4s. Bd. per cent. At December, 1907, the item stood
at £81,680, and gas sales, etc., were £8663, or at the rate
of £2l’4s. 2d. per cent. In proportion to the book value
of the undertaking, the receipts have therefore im-
proved a good deal during the last four years.
A little of the improvement is due to the earnings
of deposits; but that wouldn’t account for much.
Whether the bulk of it is due to new mains, etc.,
having been paid for out of revenue, or to Brisbane being
now able to pay for more gas, there is no way of ascer-
taining. Consequently there is no way of ascertaining
how much depreciation is allowed for ; and, unless suf-
ficient allowance is made for that, some of the profit
shown may not be true profit at all, and some of the
reserves may be a mere set-off against rust and wreckage
and decay. On the whole, however, the position appears
to be strong, for even after making some (unknown) pro-
vision for depreciation, the recent additions to formal
reserves have been very substantial. The co., besides
£52,500 of capital, has £15,000 of 4 per cent, debentures
repayable in 1915. Of the capital, £17,500 is 6 per cent,
preference (50,000 shares of 10s., paid to 75.); the other
is in 70,000 shares fully paid to 10s. The co.’s liabilities
apart from debentures total £1518; and liquid assets
before paying the dividend exceed* £4500.

Herein you see some of the fruits of the new tariff. It is
true that the attempt, based on the fat seasons, to pro-
mote a wild boom in Sydney suburban land failed ; yet
the landscape, half-way up in the wilderness towards
Newcastle, is littered with “ Great Auction Sale ’ signs
from Gosford they reach down to Gronulla. Still, m the
aggregate these transactions don’t amount to very much ;
the big ones, with which R. and W. are most concerned,
have been in city and suburban properties—properties
secured for factories, and for new warehouses to hold
the new Australian goods, and for shops to cater for
the new customers that new industries mean. A wild
idea has prevailed, in Sydney especially, that only two
classes benefit by Protection —“ bloated ” manufacturers
and (sometimes) their workpeople. Yet here is a
concern, some of whose chief owners are typical Sydney
Freetraders, largely benefiting by the policy which these
chief owners have been fighting and decrying for years.
Some people don’t deserve to get more than 5 per cent.
R. and W., Ltd., is now 18J years old. It began with
£57,500 of a goodwill item; this has now been written
down to £40,500, and, after paying current div., there
will be £1684 left over to further reduce that deficit. The
capital represented by tangible assets totals £21,184,
or about 7s. Id. per share. The shares are worth about
13s. 6d. in the market, so the market presumably values
the goodwill now at about £19,500. It is a lot Of
money to pay for a signboard, and the right to use the
names of two long-since-departed gentlemen ; still it is a
lot less than the £57,500 which the co. paid originally.
By the way, it is just 50 years ago since Mr. Wrench suc-
ceeded Mr. Richardson as general manager of the A. J.S.
Bank—or Mr. Richardson succeeded Mr. Wrench, writer
isn’t sure which. Anyway, both of them shortly after-
wards went out of banking, and hoisted the R. and W.
placard.

It is a strange, eventful history. The co. was formed in
1888, and next year the new idea in pictures began to coin
money. In June, 1889, 5 per cent, was paid; in July
another 5 per cent. Then a coolness began. It was
December before a further 2£ per cent, arrived. But the
holiday rush was fair, and January and February, 1889,
supplied each another 2£ per cent. Then for 18 years
there was not another breath of a dividend. But all this
time the co. hung on to its freehold block in George-
street, and in 1906 another new idea in amusement broke
out—ice-skating. Promptly another co. was formed,
which took from this Cyclorama Co. a 20 years’ lease of
the land and building at £lOOO a year, with £5OOO as a
sort of ingoing or cash bonus, with the right to buy
the property for another £20,000 inside five years.
The £5OOO has been paid, and has wiped out
the old co.’s mortgage ; the co. squares things by
writing down the value of the property to the £20,000
which the new co. has the right to buy it for. The rent
pays the div. shown above—it scarcely pays 5 per cent, a
year, but there are a few hundreds besides in hand. So
the new co. is bound to either pay £lOOO a year for 20
years, or buy straight out for £20,000, which, with cash in
hand, means 20s. in the £ of the old co.’s capital (£20,800).
One question that remains hangs upon the of the
new co. to go on paying £lOOO for 20 years supposing ice-
skating fizzles out; and that is a matter of opinion. On
the Melbourne experience, the prospects of its being able
to pay the £lOOO a year, out of profits from the ice-skating
business anyway, are not cheerful.

The way in which this co.’s accounts are presented is
absurd. For the past year the profit and loss account
show's a profit of £440 ; but £1278 falls into the reserve
fund in the balance sheet, and there isn’t a word to ex-
plain where it comes from, or how it is made up, or what
it consists of. It may be provision for depreciation, in
which case it isn’t true reserve at all; if a milk cart cost
£4O, and is half worn out, then the £2O which is in the
depreciation reserve is a mere set-off against the half of
the value of the cart that has disappeared. The nature
of these reserves ought to he specified. The co.
owes £16,520 ; and its live capital is only £1425. As
buildings and plant stand at £28,218, it is obviously of the
utmost importance that the reserves should be solid ; for
a very small depreciation of the value of the buildings
and plant would wipe out all the capital. The concern
may be highly prosperous ; the dividend of 10 per cent,
may be amply justified ; but for a concern whose debts
are 12 times the amount of the live capital, and whose
capital and borrowings are sunk in buildings and plant,
far too little information is forthcoming as to (1) the
depreciation allowed and (2) the nature of the reserves.

The Bulletin’s record of this co. runs back to 1897,
when it was paying 15 per cent, apparently as a con-
firmed habit. What amount it provides out of revenue to
cover depreciation isn’t mentioned. Part of the reserves
(£3947) represents plant and meter renewal accounts.
This is a set-off against the decay of plant that isn’t yet
decayed enough to need renewing. But, in addition,
something has, it seems, been directly written off the
book value of plant, etc. Five years ago • “ land, mains,
etc.,” were valued at £13,052 ; they stand now at £12,360.
Meantime the surplus of liquid assets over liabilities has
moved on from £4041 to £8516 ; so, besides paying for
any works carried out since 1902, and keeping up the 15
per cent, div., the co. has put by £4475 in cash or its
equivalent. The shareholders, at any rate, have no
reason to complain. The co. charges 10s. per 1000 for
gas ; and it looks as though it might now take a trifle off
that without endangering the dividend. Certainly the
consumers, rather than shareholders, are entitled to
the first concession ; and the history of the co. shows
that some concession is about due.

This co. is the Shocking Example and the Awful Warning.
It paid away its net revenue, thinking the money was all
profit, and put aside nothing to represent wear and tear ;
so when the plant was worn, it had nothing to buy more
plant with. At December, 1903, when the auditors re-
ported that the balance-sheet didn’t show the true
position, the electric light plant, mains, and fittings were
alleged by the books to be worth £13,051 ; and in that
half-year the loss on the working of that branch was
£llB. These assets have now been written down to
£8734, and something has also come off the gas works.
Expenses have been cut down in the electric-light
branch, but even now the profit shown for the half-year
is only £l3, and £26 a year isn’t a glittering return on
£8734, so there is a lot more writing-down to do yet. The
gas business is remunerative ; the profit shown is after
paying for repairs and maintenance, which, after so long
neglect, are of course heavy—£s32 for last half-year. The
money written off out of revenue is being applied to
the reduction of debenture debt, wnich in 1903 was
£25,000 and is now £17,000. Of course, with so much
capital lost—in other words, improperly paid away in
dividends—no ordinary dividend ought to be paid now ;
the only excuse is that it is a little one.

The amounts shown as written off during the past two
years have been applied as follows i —-Plant and
machinery, £lOOO : Prospect tramway, £250 ; horses and
drays, £125. Possibly the land, quarries, etc., which are
a wasting security, are also being written down out of
revenue ; but it is not shown in the published accounts.
It was stated some time ago that 2d. per ton was added
direct to metal cost to cover wear and tear. This
amount would presumably appear in the balance-sheet in
the shape of a reduction of the book value of the assets;
but quarry and lands stand at exactly the same figure at
December 31 as they did at June 30, so there is no evi-
dence of writing down. Apart from that, good progress
is being made. In addition to the four dividends paid, or
provided for, in the past two years, the position as to
cash and liquid assets has been improved by £2440, the
excess of liabilities having been reduced from £4828 to
£2388. Part of this improvement represents depreciation,
of course—the co. has the money instead of the
depreciated value of the other assets. But while
this money is, in part, provision for future renewals, cur-
rent repairs and renewals have been charged direct to
profit and loss, at any rate during the past six months
(£489); and that strengthens the situation. Besides the
reserve shown, there is a fund to meet possible bad debts.
This has been standing at £446 for years ; so presumably
either the expected bad debts have not turned up, or if
they have turned up they have been provided for through
profit and loss account. The co. was reconstructed in
1903, when the capital was reduced from £34,000 to
£27,200 ; and that probably explains why nothing was
written off plant, etc., in 1904 and 1905. As shown above,
the quarries, etc., have not been written down during the
past term ; yet it is certain that in years to come there
will have to be a further writing down of capital unless
the wasting assets are gradually written down out of
revenue.

The sudden fall in the bank rate in London,
and the consequent jump in the share markets, has got a
good many dealers and gambling brokers in a tight place.
The brokers had got an idea that the troubles wouldn’t
lift for months—that things would probably be worse by
March instead of better—and they sold forward whenever
they could get a buyer. When things suddenly changed,
and the share markets started to pick up, there was a
rush to cover, which accounts for the Broken Hill group
alone putting on a total of nearly a million one recent
24 hours. Even now the market in B. H. Souths and
Junction Norths especially is heavily oversold, and
there is a worried demand for scrip. Some members
of the bear family see that when this quite artificial
demand is satisfied the tendency' must be (other condi-
tions being equal) for the market to fall back; but un-
fortunately for them, they are in a trap, and can’t wait
for the market to fall back. Already there have been
three failures in the southern markets.

Julius Matton, the metal man whose statistics
are known in most places, writes from London (Dec. 27): —
“The accumulation of concentrates in the hands of
dealers at Port Pirie has been made the most of by bears
in our lead market, and has no doubt contributed to the
loss which the mines have suffered through the low price
of lead. It strikes me, however, the mines at Broken
Hill are themselves partly responsible for this loss. Lead
had been very short in Europe during the greater part of
this year, and, even now, there are no stocks here, so
that these concentrates could easily have been sold, if it
had not been for the short-sighted policy of the mines in
stimulating such competition between the dealers, that
they' had to allow a reduction-charge at which it was im-
possible for them to sell to the smelters. With so low a
reduction-charge the smelters could not only make no-
thing out of it, but would have to work with a loss. If you
sell a product above its value, you may think yourself
very clever at the time, but you will find out that it
works against your interest later on.
“It is not my intention to intercede for the
dealers ; on the contrary, I think the mines would do much
better if they would deal direct with the smelting works in
Europe. It is a bad thing for the lead market that the
original Broken Hill mine has been split up in different
companies. If it were still one co., what a power it would
be in regulating the output and thereby the price of lead 1
What is the use of the different mines trying to increase
their production and selling large quantities for less than
they could obtain for smaller quantities—to say nothing of
shortening the life of their mines thereby? As the mis-
chief of splitting up the original mine is done, there
remains only one remedy, viz., combined action. Why
don’t the mines open a selling agency in Europe, which
would have to deal with the whole output of the different
mines? If they would offer the concentrates c.i.f. Euro-
pean ports, at the monthly or half-monthly average price
on arrival and a reasonable reduction charge—going up
and down with the price of lead, as the loss in smelting is
larger at a higher price—they would most likely be able
to dispose of their yearly output on contract beforehand.
Each mine would have to participate in the contract in
proportion of, say, its present production, and would
have to curtail production in the same ratio, if enough
had been sold. Only in combined action in this or a
similar way rests the prolonged and permanent pro-
sperity of the different mines at Broken Hill. Lastly, if
they want to get a steadier market and a good average
price, they ought to induce the Broken Hill Prop, to give
up selling its lead to dealers on average prices. The
dealer cannot buy and sell at the same price, and I don’t
blame him for manipulating the market in such a way
that he gets a low average price. But this, as a child can
see, is detrimental to the producer who sells on this basis,
and to the market in general.”
What metal-expert Matton proposes may be
a good enough thing for the Broken Hill cos., but it isn’t
a good enough thing for Australia. Why should Aus-
tralia feed the furnaces of Germany and Belgium ? Why,
when it wants population so badly, should it give em-
ployment to foreign smelters, coal-miners, coke-makers,
engineers, machinery-builders, and brick-makers, instead
of having the smelters, miners, etc., etc., here? Why
cart dirt to Europe, at great expense, when the dirt can
be got out in Australia just as well, with the
help of coal which is even cheaper in Australia
than it is in Europe? By a system of bonuses ana
subsidies Germany has collared the smelting business,
and Australia has so far meekly' allowed it to do the
collaring. All this, however, doesn’t alter the fact that
the Broken Hill cos. can be just as guilty of cutting one
another’s throats as the Newcastle coal cos. have been at
various times ; and a combination to regulate the

the Colonial Mutual was, to use an Americanism, ‘ trying
to bite off more than it could chew.’ Time has proved,
however, that if the then four-year old could go fast it
could also go sure, and its completion of £1,156,510 of
new life business last year indicates that not only is the
energy of its younger days unabated, but that it retains
the confidence placed in it from the moment of its birth.”*

The Zino Corporation, of which it was boasted
that it was going to do its own smelting has been
anxiously looking for a firm to smelt its lead concern
rates and to that end opened up negotiations wfth
tne n. n. jrrop. JNo hnality has yet been reached u
imposing pile of mill buildings has been erected neir the
South Blocks mine and, a.? a working modetthe con-
traption seems fairly perfect. If things go all right
there will be no handling of material from the time the
tailings are placed in the bins till they leave the plant in
the shape of residues and concentrates. p
The expert sent to Broken Hill by the Sulphide
Corporation to try to effect a separation of the zinc from
the lead concentrates produced at the slimes plant only
reached half-way to success. The slime plant is still idle
and the Corporation intends to wait and see what can be’
done with the concentrates in their present zinc-lead con-
dition. It is a pity the zinc trouble cannot be overcome
seeing the excellent concentrating work the plant was
doing in other respects. y

Notwithstanding that a small profit over work-
ing expenses can still be obtained at the present price of
tin the Board has deemed it expedient to cease operations
for the present. That is the pith and marrow of the
Elsmore report. The co. was formed of big Melbourne
people to sweep up some New England (N.S. W.) tin. The
co. undertook to pay £2500 cash to the vendors out of the
hrst profits, and by the time £2500 was accumulated the
tin market wasn t looking quite so gay ; £2500 didn’t
look much on a prospectus, but it is a lot to wash
out of stuff that only goes 2Jlb. of tin to the cubic yard
However, the money has been paid, as well as one six-
penny dividend (7s. was called up); and when the tin on
hand is &old the overdraft will only be a couple of hundred

stand better in the future why the few Chinese up Tingha'

Barrambie Ranges have got a report with a
little ginger in it. Writers are Sanderson Bros., Hopking
and Co., of Perth, who don’t mince matters. Ore in sight
above hio. 1 level is given at 3400 tons, worth loz. per
" c^ors differ, of course, but where, oh ! where is
al <?e3oz stuff on which the market was boomed? Out
of the 3400 tons a profit of £l7OO a month is looked for
or about £oooo from the lot. But the whole of the present
scheme of working is condemned. A new shaft is advised
money is needed to bring the battery up-to-date, while
rock drills and other little etceteras are asked for. There
won t be much left when these things are provided, save
the wailing of those who rushed scrip at over 455. The
phrase that the lode has the appearance of living to great
depth, and that the present size and value are likely to
continue, are the only words of cheer in a yard of cold
criticism. It isn’t much to live on in such tough country
as that at Barrambie Range. J

The reserves of the Golden Horseshoe (W. A.)
are now given as 1,062,332 tons, containing 650,608 fine oz.
The tonnage is about the same as last year, but the value
is £123,000 less. A gradual falling-off in grade as com-
pared with shallower points—the general thing with the
Kalgoorlie ore—accounts for this drop. The Horseshoe
still ranks, however, as one of the best mines of the
field, and will be paying dividends long after some of the
other Golden Mile producers are dead and gone.
* * * «
Gwalia South Co. (W. A.) seems to be in a violent
hurry to pay dividends. First distribution of ss. per
share on 16,000 pref. shares has just been made ; and
almost the whole of the co.’s spare cash was mopped up
in doing it. Another ss. remains to be paid on these
shares, after which all the 66,000 shares in the co. rank
alike as regards dividends. Someone has started a rumor
that, when the pref. dividends are paid, there will be
little left in the mine for ordinary shareholders, but
from what The Bulletin can learn things are not nearly
so bad as that. Probably the mine will pay good divi-
dends for a time ; but, as it loses its shoot at about 600 ft.
from the surface, its life must necessarily be short, unless
new makes of ore are discovered.
« » » *
Burbanks Main Lode (W. A.) paid its first divi-
dend (10 per cent.) the other day, and, according to the
Board, “shareholders may confidently look forward to
regular distributions on an increasing scale.” In the
past, profits have been put back into the mine and swal-
lowed up in the purchase of machinery ; but now that
development is a good way ahead of the mill, and the
equipment is completed, most of the surplus earned in
the future is to be divided among shareholders. The co.
has a, small capital—for a London concern—and, con-
sidering its prospects as per recent official reports, it is
surprising that its shares are still quoted at under par.
Either speculators have no faith in what the management
says, or a good thing is going begging.

Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) is now said to
have 461,598 tons of 7£d\vt. ore in sight. Compared with
last year’s figures, this estimate shows an increase in
tonnage, but the grade is more than ldwt. less. The cur-
rent year’s profit is estimated at £90,000, and no doubt
this much will be made ; but it will come as a surprise if,
after that, the mine is not found to be much poorer than
the estimate just issued indicates. Meantime, the treat-
ment plant employees are losing sleep trying to discover
how the published figures as to monthly tonnage are
arrived at.

Oroya East Co. (W.A.) has decided to wind up.
This concern is one of the Hannan’s Proprietary pups,
and was floated in 1899 to acquire and work a valueless
block of ground lying east of the Hannan’s Oroya. After
all the working capital had vanished and shareholders
had jibbed at subscribing any more, work on the half-wages
half-tribute system was started, and has been carried on
ever since. Now, as no one seems anxious to look for gold
in the lease, the co. has wisely decided to pass itself out.
Tributors now have possession of the Cosmo-
politan Proprietary (W.A.), and the management is doing
its utmost to make them comfortable. The co. may earn
a little by hauling and treating tributors’ stone, but So
! ar *® profits from the mine itself are concerned share-
holders have seen the last of dividends.

Golden Pike and Lake View East Co. (W.A.)
still wears a mournful expression. For some time past

chance of getting the continuation of the rich patch of
ore ® l (P ose d in the adjoining Boulder No. 1 lease, but re-

R y tbe time this issue is hatched the Great
kitzroy (Central Q.) should have started smelting, if it
intends to start at all. Fitzroy was a great bait for the
public when Doolette got hold of it, and brought 8., M.
and Co. in Copper was then sky high, the public had
some cash, and a large section of it had very little
sense ; and so it looked as if the promoters would have a
good time. But copper fell, and share values shrank, and
cover ” bad t 0 be P u k U P> and the public found
that it was gradually getting sober. And the more sober
it got the more scrip it discovered it held, and the same
old recovery is now being suffered. All the time the
above was happening, B„ M. and Co. were getting Great
kitzroy ready. But the market broke, and now without
much public money in the concern 8., M. and Co., at
Great lutzroy, are up against a snag. It’s not the first
they ye struck, so they will probably know how to get
round it if they can’t get over it.

There are close on 500 men at the Oaks gold
rush, Einasleigh (N.Q.). With further prospecting, it is
found that the alluvial area is greater than was originally
supposed. As usual, men are being warned from
rushing the place, and as usual the warning is disre-
garded, because up to date over IOOOoz. of gold have
been recovered from the alluvial, and IOOOoz. sounds
a good bit until you divide it by 500. One thing in its
favor: “tucker” is fairly cheap—the district can supply
better and cheaper beef than the cities. There is magni-
ficent agricultural land round the Einasleigh, too, and
with the advent of the Etheridge line maize and other
cereals will be grown largely. Queensland mineral fields,
generally speaking, are excellently situated in point of
elevation, climate, and arable land. Cloncurry is the
most notable exception.

Accounts of Gilmore, the best North Queensland
tin-show put off during the recent boom, have been made
up to January 28. The half-vear’s dividends—only one
month was missed—ran to £5906, including div.-duty ;
but, in order to pay that much, the profit-and-loss credit
of £633 at the start was turned into a debit of £239 at the
end. Only the tin actually sold has, however, been passed
through profit-and-loss account; and, though the figures
don’t show it, the directors say that about 90 tons of tin
concentrates, estimated to be worth £3OOO, have also
been produced. This is apparently additional to
the 100 tons of Dolly Grev stone which was
going through the mill at the end of the half-
year. But, though there will be dividends in future,
they will be irregular ; the reserves blocked out are not
large, and the shoots are irregular, as tin shoots almost
always are.
* * * *
Geologist Rands’ report on Peak Downs is one
of the most copious ever written about a Queensland
mine ; and in practically every respect he supports the
views that, to the disgust of the directors, have been ex-
pressed in The Bulletin for many months. “ Very little
prospecting or development has,” he says, “ been carried
out by the present co., and nothing has been done to test
the lode below the old workings. . . An error was made
in erecting the furnace plant before carrying out develop-
ment. . . Leaving out the quality of tbe ore, there was
not sufficient ground opened up to keep the furnace sup-
plied with ore without overcrowding the miners. . . If
operations are started again, the development of the mine
below the present levels must be the first consideration,
as on that depends the future.” Rands strongly recom-
mends that the mine be further prospected : “ There is
every reason to expect that good bodies of ore will be
met with below.” Then, given success in that direction,
and with better management (that is, reduced mining
and smelting charges, etc.), “ ore containing about 4J per
cent, of copper should be mined and smelted at a profit
with copper at its present price.”
* * * *
Mount Molloy (Q.) shareholders will probably
want John Moffat to explain how the co.’s finances got
into their present mess. Things would probably have
drifted still further if the Q. N. Bank hadn’t put down an
emphatic foot —a very proper thing to do, though it cost
the bank an account. The question now is, shall it be
debentures or a pref. issue ? In the end it will probably
be the latter. There is no doubt about John Moffat’s
faith in the concern being still strong; even when it was
certain the market would weaken, his party hung on to
its very big holding. It seems to he just a case of a very
busy man allowing matters to drift, and when John
Moffat didn’t interfere nobody else felt he had a right to,
so great is the remarkable old gentleman’s influence in
those quarters.
• • * *
The Mt. Cannindah (Q.) accounts are issued
without any remarks by the directors—apparently
Robert Philp and his colleagues were too overcome for
words. Profit and loss account shows a debit balance of
£3653, after writing off £2628 for depreciation ; but, then,
the proceeds of the sale of the 60,000 shares bought by
8., M. and 00. for £9OOO are credited to this account—
which is extraordinary bookkeeping, to say the least of
it. The actual position is that £17,127 was derived from
ore, concentrates, etc., while expenses (apart from depre-
ciation and works charged to capital account) amounted
to £27,152, leaving a loss of £10,025 on the operations.
Fortunately, the sale to 8., M. and 00. saved the co.
from a heavy overdraft: the year ended on January 27
with a credit balance of £282 and no liabilities. Work is,
of course, now suspended. R. C. Philp, the general
manager, thinks that if the partly-erected new mill were
completed and a blast furnace substituted for the reverb.,
the mine would pay with copper at £6O per ton.
That, however, means reconstruction, the present capital
(£36,000 in 360,000 shares) being exhausted. Something
more cheerful than that “ the mine could he made to
pay ” at £6O per ton may have to be said before more
money is put up, though up to now the bulk of the share-
holders have provided very little.

country reached at 500 ft. as identical with the Bendigo
auriferous zone. Therefore he wants capitalists to sink
snafts and crosscut east and west to pick up the saddles
and the gold. The mining geologist is on a better
P! a ? e nowadays ; but, unless Castlemaine puts up a
little of the cash it has made out of dredging, Dunn’s re-
commendation will fall flat. More’s the pity, for Castle-
maine is real geologist's ground.

Mt. Lyell has at last hit the bornite with the
Pmkat 1000 ft. in the North Lyell mine. The market was
doubtful to the last, and hammered at the scrip, believing
that risks could be taken when a co. has a million shares.
Hut it is really not the strike of bornite at 1000 ft. that
holds up prices. The 850 ft. level is opening out like a
jeweller s shop in Nos. 18 and 20 stopes, the bornite in
some places glistening like a peacock's tail in the sun-
nght. Both richness and extent have been proved, so
that at least a couple of years’ life can be tacked on to
the mine on account of the late developments at 850 ft.
alone.

Tasmanian Copper, Rosebery (Tas.), was so
hurt by the fall in copper that it wants a modest £25,000
to repair finances. Not that the Tasmanian mine did the
damage. The Blinman, Leigh’s Creek, and other shows
up north in South Australia, ate up an alleged profit of
£30,000, built when the metal was booming. Tasmania
holds a big block of scrip, but, seemingly, doesn’t like
parting up, knowing that J. Bull control’s the manage-
ment, and may dribble the cash away. A. J. Thynne, of
Queensland, is putting up £5OOO to bind a contract to
smelt the ore from the Tasmanian mine, which ought to
fix the value of the 200,000 tons in sight. By the way,
whom does A. J. Thynne represent? It would be inter-
esting to know.
• * • *
Excuses won’t make the attitude of the Briseis
(Tas.) directors any better. Wash going up to 301 b. to
the yard, has been got in the tunnels driven in the North
Ringarooma ground. The man in the market knows it,
for he gets the news from Tassy or London ; but share-
holders have to starve for an official word. The Argus
pitches into A. J. Peacock ; but it knows well enough that
Peacock isn’t likely to trouble when membership of a nice
comfortable Board like the Briseis weighs in the balance.
Bowes Kelly is ill, and, even if well, doesn’t give much
away ; while the militant Hughes is very tame when out
of his uniform. A clean sweep is the remedy, and if the
weary-Willies in Melbourne perked up to the extent of
unitedly protesting to London, they would compel prompt
attention.
* • • •
Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) has been mining and milling
its dirt at the low cost of 5». 4d. per ton. Last half-year
gave a profit of £14,768 ; and, as 58,830 tons were sent to
the mill, the profit pans out at j'ust about ss. a ton.
Even at present prices Bischoff only requires to recover
71b. or 81b. of tin oxide per ton of ore to pay expenses.
Mine developments have been good ; some hundreds of
feet have been driven on “ first-class lode material,” 4ft.
wide. New brooms sweep clean, and new manager J. D.
Millen suggests many changes, including the removal of
the mill. Pretty well everj'thing is run by electricity,
and two small electric engines are now to do the under-
ground haulage. The mine pays reasonable wages, yet the
cost of mining only averages 2s. 7d. a ton. The coolie,
in the Straits Settlements, doesn’t produce tin cheaper;
but payment of wages in silver upsets a comparison as
to costs.
* * * *
Magnet mine (Tas.) recently had trouble with
the men. The manager refused to receive a deputation
from the Miners’ Association, but agreed to meet the
men simply as employees. This the men (who all belong
to the Union) resented, and ceased work. Executive
officers were able to effect a compromise, so as to give
the directors time to consider whether they would
recognise the Union. The directors belong to a past age,
but should still be able to see that but for the existence
of the organisation, they would now be fighting their
employees in a very doubtful and expensive battle.

The Colebrook, Rosebery (Tas.), is expected to
move along directly, though some cautious people still
doubt whether the smelters will be completed. This
seems now, however, beyond doubt ; the more doubtful
thing is whether prospects will improve afterwards.
Those in control say that with copper at £6O, 2 per cent,
ore will pay dividends, and that plenty of ore above this
value is available. The co. should have nearly enough in
hand to reach the production stage.

The public feels a mild sensation of curiosity
concerning Adelaide’s latest. It is the prospectus of
something called “The Christian Colonists, Ltd.,” with a
capital of £1,000,000 in £1 shares and a pilot (sky-pilot ?)
syndicate for the same with a capital of £lO,OOO. (This
sounds like an appropriation for surveying a stock-route
to the banks of Jordan.) The prospectus, which is decked
out with scriptural quotations, states that the object of
the promoters is the founding of a colony, and that the
scheme is connected with J. T. Moate’s proposal for the
Australian transcontinental line. The looality of the
proposed settlement, however, is not mentioned, and the
question of what the Christian Colonists are going to do
once they have dumped their swag in the wilderness isn’t
touched upon. Moses and Brigham Young were the two
most conspicuous characters who led great religious
movements out into the wilderness ; but this affair doesn’t
seem to be exactly Prophet Moses nor exactly Prophet
Young.
• • * •
Waihi, which is Maoriland’s pride, and Mt.
Morgan, which is Queensland’s, run each other very close
in the value of production. The Waihi treated 25,967
tons in December for £64,085; Mt. Morgan during
January treated 35,065 tons gold and copper ore for
£64,400. The Queensland show has paid the most money
in dividends ; but then Mt. Morgan has to carry twice as
many shares. Waihi was put on its feet by the cyanide
process ; up to the discovery of that, the show had been
a struggling concern in a district mainly devoted to pigs
and peaches. Chlorine did the same for Mt. Morgan.
Both chemicals dissolve the gold, and give a good extrac-
tion when the metal is precipitated. Producer gas has
caught on at Waihi, and a large plant is at work. A
place where coal is dear will generally give producer gas
a trial, although small installations without proper appli-
ances for extracting tar and other by-products have not
been an unqualified success.

The Gilmore (N.Q.) directors “congratulate
shareholders on coming through a period of unusual
depression (in the tin market) with such satisfactor
results. There has been no unusual depression in the
tin market. The present London price is £l3O. and it
has got very little below that. Instead of being poor
that is an excellent price. The average for not one single
year between 1880 and 1900 was so high. Ten years
ago the average (for 1897) was £6l Bs. Just because last
year ana the year before prices boomed tremendously, an
awful lot of rubbish is now talked about “ the unusual
depression in the metal markets.”

CUTTIN’ FLAX.
[Fob The Bulletin.]
Trampin’ deep in gullies cool,
Workin’ early, workin’ long,
Where the water in each pool
Ripples like the bell-bird’s song ;
Sinkin’ in the sticky soil
On the rough-hewn bushland tracks,
So we burn aw'ay life’s oil
Cuttin’ flax.
On my right a ne’er-do-weel,
On my left a “ convict once,”
And a Danish lout from Kiel,
Half an idiot, half a dunce,
Bearded Yankee from the States,
Bluenose cove from Halifax —
Oh, we meet some quaint old mates
Cuttin’ flax.
Far away from any town,
Miles away from any pub,
Some our past lives living down,
Others living just for grub,
With our only boon a smoke
(Straining arms and aching backs) —
O, I tell you ’tis no joke
Cuttin’ flax.
And this blanky bush is dumb,
That’s the horror of it all,
For sometimes old dreams will come,
And old scenes we will recall !
But we keep no count of years,
We’ve no use for almanacks ;
There are graves for hopes and fears
Cuttin’ flax.
MAORILAND. TE ArOIIA.
“ Entiac ” : “ Gip ” has taken only a
superficial glance at the “ green grub ’’ which so
surprised the black ants. This grub is a cater-
pillar, and has the power of exuding a very acrid
and offensive fluid for defensive purposes. Those
ants “ Gip ” saw had possibly been carting sugar
the day previously, and the change from sugar to
green grub cannot be expressed in figures. Any-
way, an ant, whenever he hits anything too
steep, pretends to be drunk—just as some men
do under similar circumstances. Saw an unedu-
cated magpie drive his bill into a green grub. As
soon as he got the flavor he gave a wild yell and
backed water, flying tail first for a few yards,
trying to shake off the smell. He managed to
reach the low branch of a friendly gum, and I
thought he would knock his bill off belting it
against the hard wood. This “catter” has a
particularly bland and child-like demeanor ; but
then so has Limburger cheese.
“ Pine Scrub ” : Agree with “ Agricola ”
(B. 9/l/’08) as to the futility of erecting low
netting fences. Even with 3ft. Gin. netting (Gin.
in ground), some rabbits climb over. In one
instance, where a corner was netted to a height of
3ft. 10in., I found a rabbit caught by the leg in
the top of the netting while attempting to scale it.
Also there are hundreds of bushes here (Nyma-
gee, N.S.W.) ringbarked up to 6ft. or 7ft. from
the ground, and in dozens of these bushes are
dead rabbits hanging by the legs or neck. In this
district, the netting fences are laid down with pit
traps every half-mile, and when rabbits are thick,
cleaning said traps is Gehenna’s own undertaking.
Think of one vast stench, a conglomeration of all
the aromas mentioned in a bad-smell competition,
then add a charnel house and a dead chemist’s
shop, and you may have a faint idea of a pit-trap
that is working overtime in midsummer.
HIS INDIGNANT PROTEST.
PARSON : "My kind friend, are you a Christian ?”
NIGGER: “Does I look like a Jew , boss?”
Uncle Sam fell the other day— fell and lay
helpless in the gutter. He was a giant who rose
200 ft. from the ground alongside the Healesville
to Maryville track (Vic.), and spanned 70ft. in
circumference at the base. Even then Sam didn’t
hold the record, which, so far as is known, belongs
to a bit of a stick on Mount Horsfall, North
Gippsland, which trifle of wood stands up 400 ft.,
and takes a 90ft. tape to circle it. Uncle Sam
aforesaid was found to be completely rotten inside
—doubtless the result of republican institutions.
“Kodak”: Gash-
leigh has a hunting
dog. Gashleigh doesn’t
call it a hunting dog,
but that’s what it is.
It sits on the hearth-
rug before you and
hunts while you talk to
Gashleigh. When I
pass Gashleigh’s place
on the way to the
station I see Bizzy
sitting on the mat
hunting. Coming home
in the evening, I look
over the fence and see
Bizzy in a contorted
attitude in the middle
of the path—still hunt-
ing. Bizzy is called
after the late Prince
Bismarck. I used to
think at first that he
got his name through
being such an indus-
trious dog. Whenever
I gaze upon Bizzy I
feel glad that I’m not
famous. Somebody
might name a dog like
Bizzy after me. At
odd intervals the
thought seems to
strike Gashleigh that
Bizzy might be a more
restful animal “if
something could be
done for him, y’
know.” Gashleigh
talks about it as if it
were a case for an arch-
bishop and a full choir
to grapple with, in-
stead of being a matter
of dog-soap' and water.
He assures everybody
in a tearful voice that
“ there’s really nothing
in it. He just does it,
y’ know. Stop it,
Bizzy 1 ” Bizzy looks
round in a reproachful
way and desists for
exactly 32| seconds, at
the end of which period
he has to turn like a
fiend and fight a des-
perate rearguard
action on the
slope of his left
hind leg. Most
of Gashleigh’s
callers are re-
signed to Bizzy,
but a man went
out to see Gash-
leigh on business,
the other night. The
man had had no
warning about Bizzy and his status in Gash-
leigh’s household, and. as he was one of the
bluff, outspoken kind, he asked Gashleigh in
a stern, loud tone what he was doing for
the dog. Gashleigh replied in his usual tearful
fashion that he had tried everything. The
stranger was himself the possessor of several dogs,
and, being well up in the subject, reeled off a list
of about 85 different remedies. Gashleigh couldn’t
possibly claim to have tried them all, so Vie fell
back on his usual excuse that “ there was really
nothing in it —he just did it, y’ know.” The
newcomer gave one glance at Bizzy under the
table putting up a game fight for his life, and
pointed a trembling hand at his optimistic owner.
“By G d, sir,” he burst out passionately, “if I
owned an animal and he scratched like that, I’d
have him d n well boiled, and if he didn’t
stop then, I’d have him shot.” Then the stranger
got up and strode out of the house, leaving Gash-
leigh breathing hard through his nose and Bizzy
tied up in four knots on the hearthrug.

“ J.P.” : If you haven’t shut down on the
Deadville competition, kindly consider
Jericho? Situated in the desert country
between Barcaldine and Alpha (Queens-
land), and within a mile of the river Jor-
dan, its very name and associations seem
to me to give it a mortgage over the
title. Milparinka, indeed—and Tiboo-
burra? 'Why, it’s like comparing
New York or Chicago to Botany.
None of the disturbing influences
of advanced civilisation contaminate
Jericho. Its inhabitants, immune
from all worldly temptation, pass
their lives in righteousness and
piety. Occasionally a bullock wag-
gon turns up with a load of wool.
This event the townspeople cele-
brate by a public holiday. Fowls
camp in the gum trees adorning the
main street, while goats feed up and
down the footpaths unmolested by
anyone. When night falls, and the
goats get tired of walking, they just
make a shakedown on any old
verandah that happens along. A
vast amount of other evidence could
he adduced in support of this town’s claim.
However, enough. If it doesn’t win I shall be
disappointed, also surprised, for, properly speak-
ing, Jericho isn’t a town —it’s a morgue.
“W. P. B.” : It would appear that
“ Hassan ” is in darkness re sharks (B. 23/l/’08),
and I will throw a little light thereon, and so
prove that our friend is in ignorance. He says
that in 15 years he has only known of one case
where a person, while surf bathing, has been
taken by a shark, and that was at Newcastle;
also that the beach shark doesn’t diet on flesh,
etc. Verily, “ Hassan ” knoweth not what he
gasseth about, not by a long chalk. Within less
than 15 years (by a great deal) two people to my
knowledge have been assailed by the finny denizen.
One was on Newcastle beach proper and the other
at Merewether. One lost his arm, and it w T as
only by the efforts of his brother that he didn’t
get lost altogether; the other, by the greatest
fluke in the world, escaped with a lacerated
limb. And these instances occurred in shallow
water. Then, again, as regards the creatures eat-
ing dead bodies. “Hassan” says they don’t.
Some few years ago a girl lost her life on New-
castle beach, and when her body was recovered—
she had been floating no great distance out —it
was plainly seen that a shark or sharks had been
at her. Also sharks have been known to become
almost stranded on the beach in their efforts to
get at bathers. How can “ Hassan ” account for
these instances? Does he imagine it was the
same shark all the time ? He’s quite correct in
scooting for shore when he sees one in the surf,
and not taking any risks.
FOUND GUILTY.
MRS. JONES : “Is that you, Jones?"
JONES (been having a good time): “I dunno,
my dear, ye'd better cumanavalook."
“Gip ” : A joy in rabbit-infested country
is “cut-out’’ on a farm. Not “cut-out” in a
shearing sense, but the cut-out of each and every
cultivation paddock. Witnessed one once. We
all went up with the “lunch,” otherwise “four
o’clock.” There was mother in lilac print (she
might well be described as “ comfortable-look-
ing ”j, two small boys, one small girl, one toddling
chap of three dragging the pannikins, the lady
help (scraggy and hysterical), and two city girls
—young ladies, in fact —decorated with
long trains. On the battlefield were Dad,
genial and blustering, seven enormous sons
(nearly all six-footers), and four “stookers.”
The reaper and binder was being driven
steadily round a small patch of standing
wheat. The men knocked off to partake of
refreshment, and hurriedly resumed work.
The party from the house gathered sticks—
good solid ones for themselves and the
men. When the patch in the middle
of the paddock had been reduced to a very
small ring, work was stopped, and the
boys, after whistling to the dogs, beat it
violently, yelling like savages. Then out
rushed the rabbits that had been gradually
driven in by the machine, hundreds —nay,
thousands of them—and the corroboree
started. Everyone was yelling and sprint-
ing and bringing a stick down with violence
and effect. Mother’s jaw was set squarely
and her print skirt tucked high. One
city girl, exhausted with laughter, sat fiat
in everyone’s road, her life in imminent
danger. The other, frowning heavily, had
her train over her head. Already she had
slaughtered four rabbits, and meant to kill
at least four more. The lady-help’s thin
sandy hair had fallen about her face—she
was a fearsome thing as she ran and
screamed, her mouth wide open. The
toddler bawled lustily. The tiny girl
nursed in her small lap four baby quail.
Dad, with the whip, had killed an enormous
snake. In every corner of the field were
flying rabbits and shouting men until at
last the bunnies had disappeared. Then
proudly and breathlessly we counted our
bag—l 67 rabbits, not to mention the snake.

“ J.G.” : Be bigotry of bees (B. 9/l/’08).
They are not all Holy Romans. I was once work-
ing for a cow cocky, who rented a farm from a big
land-grabber on the northern plains of Victoria.
One season turned out a failure, and left cocky
about £lOO brief in his rent. So one day a man,
carrying a black handbag, stalked across the pad-
docks, and, marching into the cooky’s house,
cast anchor on the sofa. He said his name was
Patrick O’Grady, and he sounded like it. He was
a bailiff, he said, and was going to take an inven-
tory of the cocky’s goods, with a view of having
them sold for rent. The cocky’s wife black-
guarded the bailiff and the landlord, while the
cocky himself went over to where a few hives were
fixed up on a stand. He carefully took one off,
and, going to the door of the house, said, “ Hi,
you, Irish, while you’re at it you might as well
take a note of this.” Then he pitched the hive of
bees near the bailiff, and promptly bolted. The
bees seemed to blame the bailiff for the disturb-
ance. He got clear of the house, but he didn’t
get clear of the bees till he had plunged into a
handy dam. Another bailiff took that inventory.
During the fruit season keep a bottle of
Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera, and Diarrhoea
Remedy on hand. It may save a life.*
“ Saturday ” : This was the yarn told us
by Borego, the deck-hand late of Italy, also late
of the s.s. Flying Cinder
“ I tella you,” he said, with an apologetic wave of his
hand.
“The war-sheep ’Oratius wasa lyin’ outa froma the pier
at Geelong, an’ two-tree rivre boats run offa the people to
see ovre the war-sheep. We get gooda crowds an’ maka

Borego shook his head mournfully at the recollection.
“ Engnee drinka too mooch. Belonga to Glassaco’.
Thisa treep engnee get fool right oop with ze beer, an’

to shaka the engnee. Engnee jus’ snore—he too much

just the same. The voica-pipe say, more loudre this a
time, ‘ Stopre the eng, Borego.’ I pulla the levre. I
pulla evra ting thisa way and that. No diff-rence.
“ Skipre yell ‘ Stopre, Borego, stopre!’ I sticka my
head out the skylight and say, ‘ I no can stopre the dam
begre, skipre ! Begre no stopre ! Stopre yourself 1’ ”
Borego stood with both feet on the stool, head
lowered and clenched fists beating the air.
“ Crise ! Tree plerry tima thata Fline Cind’ steam
rounda the war-sheep. People he say, ‘ Ainta we go
aboarda?’ Crise ! Ino lika to tella them the begre no

time we scoot round they senda the gig and I giva the

Borego sat down and wiped bis lips.
“ I s’pose the engineer got the sack over that,
Borego?” queried the winchman.
“ W’at 1 ” snapped Borego. “No feer for the engnee.
When we cooma backa to Melb’n’, skipre he say, ‘ I paya

‘My worka 1 Skipre, I praya for you.’”

The wisdom of “ 8.P.” :
“ Benbie ” (B. 30/l/’08) writes to say that the single-
handed sinking of prospecting shafts may be fairly com-
mon with Chows, but not so with white men. I cannot
agree with him. I have seen dozens of shafts sunk to a
considerable depth, on the “ hatter ” system, by white
men. I once sunk to a depth of 35ft. myself, but have
sworn off that kind of biz for life—too slow and
laborious.
On one copper mine where about 30 of us were working
on tribute, at least ten were “ hatters,” and during the
two years we worked there they must have totalled
hundreds of feet of sinking on their “ Pat Malone.”
One genius spent about a week perfecting a device by
which he thought to land his mullock on the dump whilst
remaining in the bottom of the shaft hims If. He fixed
an arrangement of blocks and pulleys by which he lifted
the bucket to the brace, where it was to tip and empty
automatically, afterwards returning to the bottom by its
own weight. This experiment was watched by the
rest of the “hatters,” with a view to copying it, if
successful. Sad to state, through some cause unforeseen
by the inventor, the bucket emptied itself down the shaft
instead of on the dump, which necessitated the retirement
of one hatter to the nearest hospital.
Another old prospector, in the same district, sunk two
shafts single-handed. One was 105 ft. deep and the other
80ft. Both proved “ shicers.” He then drove a tunnel
into the side of a hill, to a distance of 200 ft., in search of
some dream gold which never materialised. All this
work he did in the space of three years.
At latest, this old fellow, who is over 60, was still pur-
suing his quest of the elusive metal in the McDonnell
Ranges, about 60 miles from any human habitation. He
was still sinking shafts and making tunnels, with no
better results than of yore.
While on the subject of the “hatter” —I met an old
chap, not long ago, in the vicinity of Pichi ltichi Pass
(northern S.A.), who was looking for a huge copper lode
which (so he alleged) he discovered about 45 years ago
when engaged with a survey party. His outfit consisted
of a pick, shovel, tomahawk, billy-can, nosebag and swag.
Said swag was the final word in originality—itr consisted
of a sheepskin wrapped around a sheet of tin. The tin
he used as a mattress, and the sheepskin as a covering.
The object of the metal bunk, he informed me, was to
“kape the rheumatiz out of me ould bones.” He scorn-
fully repudiated my insinuation that he was too old for
such work, and, informing me that he was good for
another 20 years, pursued his way.

FAIRFAX & ROBERTS,

“Agricola” : I hereby rise to pick up
“Pine Scrub” in his argument with “Brad ”
(B. 16/l/’08) re “triantelopes” spinning webs.
As “Pine Scrub” maintains, tarantulas do not
spin webs. They have no need for them, because
they catch their prey by stalking, instead of sit-
ting behind the fence and waiting for the unfor-
tunate insect to tangle itself in cobweb. I have
observed many varieties of the tarantula spider,
and have never found one with a web. There
are, however, several varieties of large spiders,
not tarantulas, which spin webs strong enough to
hold, not only bees, but large beetles. Perhaps
“Brad” alludes to them. Regarding the bee
flying home in the dusk, “Brad” remarks that
“ Pine Scrub ” must be unobservant if he has not
seen bees locked up in flowers at closing time. I
have seen them, anyway, and consider that
“Brad” weakens his case by alluding to them.
Bees seem to lose their sense of direction in the
dark, and, therefore, when they have tarried too
long, they deliberately camp, rather than chance
being bushed. Has “ Brad ” never seen them in
bell-flowers or foxgloves, or other large garden
blossoms which do not shut up and imprison them?
“ Brad’s” statement that the bee can kill a taran-
tula is, however, quite true. A tarantula is no
shucks as a fighter. Bull-dog ants, hornets and
centipedes slay him with ease, and I stand willing
to back two ordinary meat-ants against a taran-
tula any day.
CARELESSNESS.
“ No, losin’ me leg don't 'worry me so much,
mister, hut they charged me 30 bob fer cut-
tin it orf in the orspittle, and I’m blamed if
they didn’t go and bury it with a brand noo
boot on!”
“ David H. Richards ” : Bundaberg (Q.)
is the town of bootless inhabitants. All sorts and
conditions of men, women, and the birthrate
meander about shod like Adam and his missus.
One well-known storekeeper, it is alleged, has
never worn boots in his life, and yet he rides a
steel-pedalled bike with ease ; while a yarn is
current that a local Mayor once attended a coun-
cil meeting with his feet arrayed in nakedness.
True, by way of a precedent, Justice Fellows is
alleged to have sat once in Victoria in the same
state. It was in Chambers, too, so he couldn’t
hide the nakedness of his ends as he could have
done if he had been on the Bench.
TAKING HIM AT HIS WORD.
YOUNG BILL: “ Wot ’orse am I ter catch, dad? ”
DAD: "Catch the old mare, o’ course. Always wear the old ’uns out first."
YOUNG BILL: “ Then yer better go an catch her yerself."
“Happy Jack:” Travelling from Warra-
wagine station (nor’-west Westralia) to the Mur-
chison, I struck three battlers on their way to a
new rush “ about 500 miles up.” They had been
three weeks on the road, and their luck wasn’t too
good. On leaving Peak Hill they had a bicycle
a-pieee. Two bikes, however, had become total
wrecks, and they had ‘‘thrown them up a crik.”
The third bike was punctured, and was travelling
on the rims, but all the same it had to do duty as a
pack horse. At tne last boundary fence the handy
man of the three (a full-blown engineer) had
helped himself
to enough wire
to make a frame
for the bike,
and a set of
leading harness.
On the frame
the three swags
were tied, and
the leading har-
ness was fixed
on the front
fork. Each man
took his turn in
the “lead” to
pull, and one
kept the pack
horse on the
upright. They
all had sore
hands and feet.
Tucker was
nearly done, and
there was no
chance of buy-
ing any under
150 miles. They
hadn’t gone
short of meat,
however. A day
or two pre-
viously they
had struck a
b u n g a r r a’s
“nest,” and
had captured
about a dozen
of thegohanna’s
relatives. They
had a glorious
gorge, and took
the balance of
thei r catch
(alive) with
them. When I
happened o n
them they had
four left. A live
one and a roast-
ed oi.e were
riding on the
“pack - horse,”
and the man
whose turn it
was to do no-
thing but walk had a roasted one on his
shoulder, and on the end of a string he was
leading the daddy of the lot. Asked him
why he didn’t kill the said daddy. He ex-
plained that the meat wouldn’t keep so well dead,
and they weren’t sure where they would catch
the next lot. I gave them some flour, and half a
sheep, and left them battling.

“Snakebite Be Bulletin (23/l/’08) on
female wood-cutters at Gym pie (Q.). At Knowsley
(Vic.), some eight months ago, two young women
took out a permit to cut wood in the State forest.
They built a neat little humpy themselves, and
there they are still living. They work solidly all
day cutting five-foot boiler wood for the Bendigo
mines, and they can swing the axe and use the
maul and crosscut with the best. They cut on an
average five trucks a week (60 tons by measure-
ment), which is worth 18s. per truck at the stump.
“ W.8.H.” : Can give “ Vedette ”
(B. 30/l/’08) yet another instance of a big lake’s
disappearance. Lake Buloke, near Donald (Vic.),
was, till a few years ago, fed from the Wimmera
by the Avon and Richardson Rivers. Now, it is a
crab-hole, a mile square, and the rest of what was
formerly lake is being cultivated and grazed. And
for once the land shark has been kept out, for a
decent lot of bona-fide settlers are tearing up the
earth and wiping out the vermin which appeared
as soon as the water receded.

“Snowy”: A solitary horseman, as
G. P. R. James would say, was lately
making across country from Monaro to Vic-
toria, his possessions represented by two gallant
steeds and his pack. In the wilds of Croajingo-
long he halted to boil the billy. Having lit a fire,
he went along the gully in search of water. When
he returned he found that his pack had somehow
combusted—and it contained, besides £6 in notes,
a box of cartridges ! Just at that moment the
pack opened fire wildly, like an Ashantee army
with an old Snider rifle. When the scout at last
emerged from the shelter of a friendly messmate
tree, only ashes and a few cartridge cases re-
mained. This is probably the first case on record
of a man being stuck up and fired at by his own
pack-saddle.
Mary Gilmore, re the ant and the heat-
wave, likewise the spider
Yes, he was here. He swarmed up the verandah-posts
and the corner posts of the house, and in at the doors and
through the windows. He dropped from the ceilings,
looked in through the chimney, and recrudesced from the
floor. You couldn’t sit on the back steps for him, nor
yet on the front; and when you lay on the bare floor
under wet vinegar cloths, and opened your mouth and
gasped—yea ! he was even there.
He followed the fresh meat from safe to safe, and from
room to room, and when, as a last resort, it was laid away
under the house in a gloomy little calico bag, he swarmed
all over it trying to find a way in. He drowned himself
in the water that surrounded what once was butter, and
drownded (for “ drowned,” in the face of his numbers, is
too feeble a word) —drowmded himself in the oil that had
been the aforesaid butter, till he lay, a black wall, round
the dish. He died in thousands in the milk jug, and
formed rings round the water bucket. He investigated
the iron tanks. He sought the back yard, and the front
yard, the side yard and the far yard for hidden springs
that were not. He thirsted and hungered, the blackest-
looking little black ant ever pursued by angry house-
wives. Yet, contrary to usage, he never even looked at
the jams and the jellies, the honey and the sugar—at
least, not while the heat wave lasted. When the cool
change came—then, of course !
As for the spiders, I found them in my hair, and in the
blankets, in my skirts on the wall, and in the sleeves of
my blouses on the backs of chairs. They dropped from a
super-heated ceiling and rose from a blazing earth. The
young ones, sun-hatched before their hour, hung on tiny
threads, and spun “money” from every shady tree and
shrub and from the roof and the aforementioned ceiling,
ran over one’s fingers as one wrote, and down one’s nose
as one ate, turned in under one’s pillow, and drank of the
same cup.
But the spider had the best of it. For, when his many
legs wearied, he curled them up and went to sleep in a
crevice ; but the ant—the hotter and drier and dreadfuller
it grew, the more he ran and the more he multiplied.
P-S.—lt is a terrible thing to be an ant in a beat wave.
P.P.S.—I know it is a shocking thing to say, but —I
wouldn’t like to be an ant in Hell.

John Leo: Admire your adjectives—angry,
scowling, menacing, terrible, awful, furious, demoniac,
blinding, darksome, fiery, terrific, awful (twice), watery,
deadly, terrible, awful (again), angry, terrible, loud,
grand, awful (some more), sublime, majestic, heaving,
raging, relentless, spacious, foaming, supreme, raging—
all on two pages of note-paper. In fact, you seem to have
got in all the adjectives except boshter. Why did you
leave out boshter?.... Meph : Verses only fair. And
when two individuals are moaning by the fire, and listen-
ing to the wailing of the blast, or the blasting of the
whale, or something, and thinking of dead friends, and
then urging each other with artificial cheerfulness to
“drink up,” the verse needs to be better than fair
Opsonin: Just a hopeless, blank futility. Otherwise there’s
nothing wrong with it L.P.: Killed by the effort to
rhyme “ outlook ” with “ score-book.” G.H.M. : Item
about “Frederick Augustus ” and “ Stinker ” only a very
slight—almost imperceptible—variation of an oft-told tale.
... .K. A. Watts :Heis 40 years old ; also he isn’t married
that we know of. The writing of the book you speak of
spread over a few years. Probably he was about 28 when
it commenced C.E.D. : .Never rejected a batch of
copy more unanimously Jocro : “The cold grey
earth,” “ sombre bush,” “twilight’s mystic hour”—they
are phrases that would kill a better poem than yours.
Syd C.: Good lines here and there, but rather tame for the
subject.... Leonard : Just merely pretty, like a nine-
penny wax d011....Dew W. : Bulletin published that
bathroom yarn years ago P.N.E.: Bunny poem doesn’t
soar to any great poetic altitude L.M.: Don’t know
whether “Tramping” is worse than “Advertisements,”
or whether “Advertisements” is worse than “Tramp-
ing,” and the problem disturbs our sleep.... Brooklet:
Pretty in a small flowery-dell, evening-zephyr sort of way.
VV'.G.: Pun rejected with contumely J.F.D.: Not
exactly poetry. Don’t quite know what it i5....A.
Lyon: “Anagram” fails badly. “Fallen Star” must
have hit something in its descent. It’s smashed
Selah : You begin, “ Why does not somebody—a parson
who understands or wise man who knows —rise up and
speak a badly-needed word of caution to his fellow-men
against the wiles of the most dangerous variety of all the
desirable and undesirable sirens who manoeuvre on this
rose-and-purple-tinted ocean of life 1 ” Dunno ! Perhaps
he lias torn his pants at the back and daren’t rise
Hume: Begins well, then metre runs off the rails and is
ditched Cyclone: Metre jolts along pleasantly enough,
but ideas are commonplace. ..Constant Reader:
You ask, “Is it possible to make 100 per cent, or more profit
on any transaction.” It’s quite possible, but it’s darned
difficult “Carl Beston ” : Can’t recall your verses on
“ Melbourne” and “ The Sunset,” but they were probably
unsuitable : the titles sound vesy ominous. Pars aren’t
acknowledged, except in urgent cases where an imme-
diate operation seems necessary to save the patient
Risso : Theory that blood (hot) should be drunk as a cure
for (1) anaemia and (2) consumption, and also as a
means of inducing the weary of the Commonwealth
to (a) “streak out for nationhood” and (b) “hurry
up the birthrate,” submitted to our medical expert;
and by him contemned most blasphemously
Wang : Didn’t knovy Vic. lovers invariably addressed each
other when parting as Mr. and Miss Chirnside. Can’t
imagine why they do, if they do, and don’t care Phil
Random : Your exposure of “ what might be termed the
remorseless tyranny of pastoral fat,” is interesting, but
far too personal . Wertalson : Uneven as a crosscut saw
Chas. S. G.: “Hearts” close up, but not quite.
Passed on as requested Darkie : “Providence” built
on a rather slight foundation of p10t... .Tahuna : “ Sister
o’ Mine ” has just one defect —when you wrote it you had
nothing particular to say....H.C. : Only striking point
about poem wherein you apostrophise (1) “ wondrous
sea,” (2) “ stupendous sea,” (3) “ tremendous sea,” (4)
“ marvellous sea,” is the line in which you picture Ocean
as “gathering skittles from the strand” W.B.S. :
Nothingin “Cause and Effect.”.... W.R.C. : Grieved to
learn that the son of Baronet Kellett, of Kew (Vic.), is
ipso facto “a knight by letters patent.” It seems unfair
that a calamity like knighthood should come on an inno-
cent lad ai an age when protest is impracticable. Remains
for young Kellett to set his jaw and live the stigma down.
G.M.L. (Meekatharra): B£che-de-mer—viz., “sea-
cucumber” —is an echinoderm found on coral reefs. It is
a Chow-Jap food luxury... .’Possum :No plot at all—at
least not enough to be worth a mention Sidney:
“ Diabolo ” has too many weak lines.... J. McMillan:
Thanks ; it simply means that somebody sold us a stolen
joke.. ..Staunch: Notguilty.. ..Maericker: Your lengthy
history of Bill, the Dereel bush-whacker, boils down to
the following : —Bill kept a loaded gun, which he pointed
at passers-by ; he used to howl at nights (particularly at
full moon), and could be heard half-a-mile away ; in the
middle of January the countryside was fired, William was
blamed. Detectives who went to arrest Bill heard him
talking to himself. Now Bill is under restraint, and
in the place he ought to have reached years ago
H. Bell: No, they don’t rhyme at all Charles : Prob-
ably the paragraph went into the basket ages ago. If
stamps are not enclosed it’s little use sending them a
week later. By that time the thing is either accepted or
dead.... Allan : “ The Exile’s Death” tells baldly of how
a man died and was buried in the Malay Peninsula.
There are certain touches that would make such a theme
interesting, even if the subject passed out at Paddington,
but there is a dearth of them in your work.. ..W.M.A. :
“ Originalities ” lacks originality J. F. Daly : Too
many bumps in the rhythm T.E.W.: Some very good
touches ; but the track is so old and worn. Get on to a
new one, and don’t try- to cover so much ground....
Natus : Regret to say this verse would kill any poem :
When “ Mud ” saw what they were playing
His face grew hard and stern.
Small charity or pity there
While the fad within him burned.
His voice was choked with passion—
A hoarse roar came from his throat
It was not like the noise from a human—
’Twas more like an old billy-goat.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
N. Swindells : Not one out of the lot came even near
to the mark.... Realm : Wouldn’t make a coherent pic-
ture R.L.D. : It’s a pretty face, and a lovely heap of
hair, but don’t really see what we can do with it....
M.A.C. : It’s a mistake to try to invent perfectly new
human beings. Better to draw man as something dimly
resembling what he is. Then it can be seen that he is a
man, and not a gooroomaroomaroomarool C.S.F. :
Your “ first attempt.” Well, go on, and send us your
51st —and use Indian ink....XXX: Not excessively
hilarious To Some Party Who Is Still At Large: Re-
ceived huge useless picture of reddish female in scarlet robe.
She is reading a book, and a large, reddish bubble or foot-
ball hangs beside her. No name, no address, no explana-
tion—only red woman and bubbly football Iverson:
Drawing no good, and joke been used before M. 8.:
Idea worn out.... Max Caw: Sketch of a huge pair of
black feet with something (alleged to be an aboriginal)
sprouting therefrom, and pointing to a delirium tremens
dog, rejected. Ditto joke about the Irishman who only-
sawed wood with an axe.

LEAP FEAR
M [FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE year that is divides by four,
Which means, as old tradition goes,
A spinster, feeling fierce and sore
Because the men do not propose,
May climb down from her dusty shelf,
And get to business for herself.
Maids need not rave and tear their hair
If coward man neglects to ask;
Each tracks a skulker to his lair,
And takes upon herself the task.
See man in fear up every pole,
And at the foot a patient soul.
Grim joy is ours if this evoke
A change of humor for the year,
So that the great torn trousers joke,
The scorned lovers endless care, .
The dog, the boots grim fathers hurl,
May now attack the suing girl !

"TALMA ” WEEDON, photographer , and
Mayor of Melbourne.
The new city electrical engineer for the
Sydney Municipal Council is said to be one
Forbes Mackay, now employed by the Great
Western Railway Co., England. Sydney City
Council can always be relied upon to import its
big-salaried men. Though the Australian univer-
sities turn out high-class electrical engineers, not
one Australian graduate was in the final selection.
If the City Council were requested to import a
dozen aldermen from London it would get a very
necessary shock.
Captain Hunter, who took the North
Coast Steamship Co.’s Orara on its first trip to
Byron Bay (N.S.W.), has now run six steamers on
their maiden trip to that place. At the present
rate of tonnage increase, he says the last of the
next half-dozen new boats he takes there will be a
5000-ton craft, with a 27-knot speed.
Albert Edward Bird, champion long-
distance runner of the long ago, who was im-
ported by George Coppin, in 1869, along with
George Topley and Frank Hewitt, was one day
last week arrested at Port Melbourne for his own
protection. He had been wandering about in a
miserable condition, and was remanded for medi-
cal treatment. At Launceston, on Aug. 29, 1870,
Bird ran 10J miles in 56 minutes.
Mark Hammond, who died suddenly at
Manly (N.S.W.), aged 63 years, was well known in
mining circles, and made his money out of them.
He had a practical knowledge of gold-mining,
acquired at Hill End. In one N.S.W. Assembly
he represented Canterbury, and was the father of
the Act empowering municipalities to make their
own gas. He was one of the six chosen as a Pro-
tectionist bunch for the Senate at the first Com-
monwealth election.
Forbes (N.S.W.) possesses a popular
person named Hutchinson, who was elected to the
local town council in 1872, and has never yet
been beaten. When the recent municipal elections
came on, Hutchinson was on a holiday in Tasmania
and could not make any efforts on his own behalf,
nevertheless he received every vote recorded
except one. And he regards that defaulter as a
sorrowful evidence of the fact that he who is out
of sight is also out of mind.
Urged thereto a while ago by the Mount
Ida progress committee, the Westralian Govern-
ment granted a small annuity to Phil Saunders,
one of the men who have been blazing
the track to mining fields for close upon half a
century. Phil Saunders is nearly 70 now, and his
eyesight has almost gone, yet he still battles away
at) the back of Menzies, and even now isn’t past
hoping to strike the “big thing” that every pro-
spector is after. It is a favorite topic in far-back
prospectors’ camps whether, pending the arrival
of universal pensions, it isn’t up to the Australian
Government to “ do something ” for such men—
men whose wanderings bar them absolutely from
any State pension.
The estate of the late Edward Terry, of
Ryde (N.S.W.), has been sworn for probate pur-
poses at £119,768. The Terry money has been
accumulating and fluctuating since the beginning
of last century. Samuel Terry, in the early days,
married a widow, Rosetta Marsh, who, in the first
decade of the 19th century, had property in Pitt-
street. The money and property of the pair grew
until the name of Terry dotted the map of Aus-
tralia in almost innumerable places. Samuel
Terry, who was the grandfather of Edward Terry,
held from Governor Macquarie a “hotel license,”
which then simply meant a license to sell spirits,
etc., and didn’t imply accommodation, or even
counter-lunch. He had also the credit of being
the first pawnbroker in Sydney, though possibly
not a licensed one. At one time he owned several
of the most valuable corner lots in Sydney, and
when he died in 1838 his will disclosed property
to the value of half a million.
S.A. Premier Tom Price unexpectedly
bumped against the landlord in the days
when he worked on the outside of Parlia-
ment House as a stone-cutter. Price had
slaved to buy his little home ; and when
he had the deeds locked away in the “front
room,” he fondly imagined that he was clear
of landlordism. But he wasn’t. His garden
brought forth an excellent crop of fine
peaches, and he took a sample to a King
William street retailer for a quotation.
The fruiterer frankly admired the sample,
and offered 7s. 6d. a case. Price didn’t
think it was enough. While he was hesi-
tating, a fashionable dame came in to order
a case of peaches, and explained that she
wanted the best. Then she caught sight
of Price’s sample, and exclaimed enthusias-
tically, “Oh, what beauties! Can I have
acase of those?” “Yes,” said the mer-
chant, promptly. The dame expressed her
pleasure and asked how much. The seller
looked at Price, and then quoted 21s. a
case. Thomas kept silence with difficulty
until the customer had gone, and then he
demanded: “Who are you robbing; me
or that lady ? ” The retailer resented the
imputation, and threatened to heave
Thomas from the premises. But the fiery
Price repeated his question. “You must
be robbing one of us,” he added. Then
the shopkeeper explained wearily that he
had to find £l4 a week for the landlord
who lived affluently upon him in England ;
and Thomas Price went sadly to his little
suburban home, took out his title deeds,
and thought hard. He is still thinking,
and perhaps if he lives long enough he
will be able to do something in the matter.
It is a tougher problem than the Murray
waters business, though.
They knew what genuine loyalty
was in the old days. The following is from.
“ The Cruise of the Galatea ” (an account of
the Duke of Edinburgh’s trip to these
parts):—
3rd January, 1868. —The Governor and all classes have
vied with each other to make the Duke’s stay agreeable to
him, and to testify, in the warmest manner,’ the pleasure
and gratification which this visit of His Royal Highness
had afforded them ; and in all this fervor of loyalty none
were more earnest than the inmates of the Yarra Bend
Lunatic Asylum, who erected, at the entrance to their
grounds, an arch with the inscription, “ Welcome,
Alfred.”
Punjab Times, discussing Dr. Arthur’s
praise of Australia :
From the Australians we are lucky enough to have in
the Punjab, we are rather inclined to believe Dr. Arthur.
We believe we are right in saying that our local ruler,
the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, hails from the
Great Antarctic continent. Well, he, at any rate, is a
man of whom Australia or any other country may be
proud. He has an independent mind ; he is a man, from
his topee to his bootsoles ; and if Australia could spare a
few more like him we could do with them here in India.
Unfortunately Australia can’t wholly claim
Governor Ibbetson. But he was educated in
Australia (St. Peter’s College, Adelaide); hence
probably his virtues.
Law is hereditary in some families. Fully
75 years ago Gamaliel Butler was admitted to the
Bar of Tasmania —such Bar as there was in those
days. Gamaliel was a man of size in his time.
His son, Charles Butler, became a lawyer in 1843,
and his grandson, E. H. Butler, in 1872 ; and the
other day Gamaliel’s great-grandson, Lionel
Butler, was admitted. Old great-grandfather
Gamaliel is the only one of the crowd who has
passed away, so three generations of Butlers now
pursue the scanty and ill-paid brief on the Apple
Island—a State where the brief is a hungry thing
compared with the same substance on the main-
land.
AN APOLOGY.
THE CELEBRITY : “ What do you mean by
referring to me as ' soulless-minded ’?”
THE VERY PERSONAL JOURNALIST: “So
sorry. That comp, again! I dis-
tinctly wrote 'oules t-minded.’”
“ Peter Pan ” : An interesting personality
is Canon Wise, the dark-eyed and soulful person
who has had thrown at him the well-paid billet of
rector of Christ Church, South Yarra (Vic.). The
Rev. P. W. C. Wise blew into S. Australia in a
casual way many years ago, and began to make
history by converting a Low Church in an insig-
nificant country township into a giddy thing of
chasubles and stoles. The hairy Outback denizens
almost died of fright at the mystic rites and
ceremonies their shepherd carried on. The gentle-
man then floated into a large city job, and the
High Church business took on a very tall aspect.
It became so high that you couldn't see the top of
it with a telescope. An immense edifice had to
be built to accommodate the who flocked
every Sunday to see the “ show.” Notwithstand-
ing determined opposition, the Canon force-
fully did as he pleased, and at present he
is easily the Anglican High Priest of Aus-
tralia. At the last Synodical Conference he
horrified his colleagues by suggesting that con-
fession should be introduced into the church in
Australia. The stripling sat heavily on the grey-
headed clergy of his diocese, and if ecclesiastical
laws were proved to be against him he quickly
unearthed a bylaw or a writing on the wall or
something to overcome the difficulty. When the
new Bishop was imported it was hoped that High
Churchism would be trodden flat, but the Canon
lost no time in nobbling his Gaiters as well. Many
dissatisfied tray-bit donors are trying to figure out
who is running the show —the Bishop or the
Canon.
From a Melbourne reporter :
Candler, the octogenarian coroner, who has just crept
away to a secluded spot in Melbourne Club after a half-
century spent in sitting on the human dust, developed an
annoying habit which filled all who had occasion to attend
the morgue with terror. The ancient coroner got into
the way of holding his inquests in a little back room
divided from the morgue by a narrow corridor on the
north side. During nine months in the year the orderly
used to light a big coal fire in this room, and, under strict
injunction, he would carefully stop up every aperture.
Then Candler would shiver before the big fire whilst
everybody else burst out into uneasy and violent per-
•piration. One day a well-known legal light objected to
being stifled to death with the weight of his iniquities
full upon him. Candler, who is nearly stone deaf, raised
Cain when the import of the objection at last struck him.
With a malicious gleam in his dim old optic he instructed
the orderly to open a ventilator or the corridor side. A
north wind blew that day, and there were 13 deads in the
morgue. It was the last time a window was opened in
those premises while the old, smell-proof coroner was
around.
Things are not panning out too well for
the old McMillan-McArthur firm of Sydney, and
«old blasts are blowing towards Parkes’s “Heaven-
born financier.” When the old co. couldn t go
any further, William McMillan went to London
to take the chair and break the news gently,
and the cables mentioned that, of course, Wm.
McMillan and one or two of the McArthurs
would be directors of the new co. Now, how-
ever, it is cruelly cabled that, instead, “an influ-
ential directorate ” has been secured, and neither
William McMillan nor the McArthurs have a
place on it. Also “four of the old directors”
have been asked to pay up £90,000 —and a call for
£90,000 isn’t exactly a vote of confidence. In
these latter days the importers’ papers really
might have more sympathy for their old god than
they are showing ; for, after all, it was they who
puffed him up and spoiled him.
P. F. Hanran, the man whom Townsville
has for nine years reckoned just the right sort of
partner for Philp, was never known to really have
a political opinion of his own, and even in the House
the oldest reporter scarcely knows him by sight,
and wouldn’t recognise his voice if he heard it.
Townsville elected him in the first place, just as it
elected Philp, because he was a “ good sort.” He
had run a store for years, and had given “tick”
liberally when the cupboard was empty, and
hadn’t worried anybody when the bill wasn’t
paid ; and Townsville settled up finally by giving
the easy-going old chap a seat in the House to
help run the country on the same principles.
It was over Justice Owen, the just-retired
senior Puisne Judge (N.S.W.), that the old-time
row mainly raged regarding relatives practising
before pas and uncles and pas-indaw. There had
been other instances, but Justice Owen sat in
Equity, and his son practised in Equity, and
there are comparatively few Equity lawyers, so
father and son were thrown much together.
Later (1896), papa Owen went over to the Common
Law side ; but the profession didn’t give him as
much credit for it as it would have done if he had
gone six years earlier.
Pumpkin Smith has been dug up by a
Sydney Telegraph reporter for his views on the
N.S.W. Agricultural Department. Pumpkin did
not seem to have many views on the subject, but
he possessed a vast store of information about
Pumpkin. He told the reporter that he, when
Agricultural Minister, had given the fanners free
agricultural education for poor students at
Hawkesbury College, the gratis Agricultural
Gazette, free seed distributions, and a free State
bull. Also he introduced a system of free State
agricultural education, and a State Agricultural
Bank, which died. And then Pumpkin Smith
and the reporter probably had a drink to the
toast, 44 Anti-Socialism in our time.”
R.C. Coadjutor Kelly flits Hibernia-wards
shortly, which suggests the reflection that age
fails amazingly to wither the Cardinal, while
custom does not stale his capacity for saintly
graft. It has been the tradition in the past
for the Coadjutor to arrive what time the existing
head of affairs tottered in the vicinity of the sar-
cophagus. Thus Vaughan came to Australia to
coadjute for the moribund Polding. While already
on the high seas Vaughan threatened to resign
unless he were given full control in certain
directions ; a»d he got his way. Dill Mackv’s
fighting partner is of a different brand, and not at
all like Polding. He faces Time standing. Not a
convent wing opening, or school break-up, or Irish
gathering, but he is there with a few genial
stoush-provoking comments on the current
thought of the day. And he is as handy
at the game at the present moment as he
was twenty years ago. Dr. Kelly seems to have
adjudged the coadjutor job too much of a sinecure
in the circumstances for a pastor of spirit. So ho
is off. And shareholders in religious journals,
throughout the Commonwealth, breathe stertor-
ously in their relief, and smother a cheer in their
Sabbath head-gear.
THE EXPERT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If unification ever comes, I do not believe it will come
within the next 100 years. If there were a poll taken on
the question of unification or a dissolution of the
Federal bond, I believe that in almost every one of the
six States, if not the whole six, the vote would go for
dissolution rather than for unification. If the people had
come to think more of federation in its practical working
than they do, the result might be otherwise. But they
have come to think much less of it than they did. — G. U.
Reid, in Sydney Daily.
The work of Deakin, Barton, Parkes,
And other men, alive or dead,
Is futile rot, and only narks
Great minds like MINE—I urge instead
That it should be undone with speed,
It does not satisfy G. Reid.
The Herald and the Terroraph,
The Argus and the Evening News,
Agree with me ; they only laugh
And sneer, and poisonous lies diffuse,
And sow dissension’s deadly seed,
In imitation of G. Reid.
Whate’er is false, whate’er is vile,
Whate’er will work our country ill,
With forked tongue and venomed style,
We speak, and write, and fight for still.
“ Australian Nationhood,” indeed !
It does not satisfy G. Reid.
Up with our flag—the Blanky Shirt!
And raise our battle-cry anew :
“ Down with, Australia in the dirt!
Dissolve! Destroy! Defame! Undo!
Though patriots for the Nation plead,
It does not satisfy G. Reid.
The ship’s a botch ; she cannot sail;
Her crew are idiots and knaves !
Who says she can ride out the gale
In safety only lies or raves !
Of what’s been done we take no heed,
It does not satisfy G. Reid.
Let half the crew but join with me,
And all the other mutineers,
And we will sink her in the sea,
And whelm her for a hundred years?
Down with her to the ooze and weed !
She does not satisfy G. Reid.
I have condemned her fore and aft,
No matter what the world may say,
She is a slow, unwieldy craft,
Unfit to sail, or steer, or stay ;
And I’m well qualified to know,
For I’m the man who made her so !

POLITICAL
POINTS
Peter Airey (the “P. Luftig ” of much
good Bulletin verse) has come back to Queens-
land politics, having wiped up the dust of South
Brisbane with Willie Stephens, Philp’s Minister
for Vegetables and Manure.
That was a line epigram of the French
Deputy, who remarked that King Carlos “ met
with an accident incidental to his profession.”
A little unfeeling, perhaps, but the cold truth.
Autocracy must always expect to be tempered by
assassination.
“Mr. Philp has been judged and found
UTTERLY WORTHLESS,” Said the BRISBANE COURIER
in a burst of candor on February 2, 1903. And
now, after all the Courier’s struggles to boost
Philp back into power, Queensland sticks by that
opinion of five years ago.
While he is considering the question of
the size of wheat bags, Minister Chapman might
note that 30,000 tons of malting barley lately
reached Melbourne from California, the whole of
which was carried in 1001 b. sacks. There are no
4001 b. or 6001 b. bags in Uncle Sam’s country.
And yet Uncle Sam’s country seems to be moving
ahead a bit.
There were only nine months between the
last two general elections in Queensland. Kidston
was Premier about six months of that time, while
Philp ran the show for the rest of the period. The
people inspected Kidston, and increased his ma-
jority at Rockhampton from 916 last May to 918.
Then they had a brief experience of the awful
Philp, and they reduced his majority at Towns-
ville from 882 last year to 174. As for Labor-
leader Bowman, his majority last May was 352 ;
last week it had gone up to 862. Roughly speak-
ing, in his own electorate, popular opinion of
Bowman has gone up 510, and Kidston has gone
tup 2; while Philp, in the town where he is best
known, has gone down in popular estimation 708.
The heroic and successful efforts made by
six white men to rescue the Chinese crew of the
Windsor, wrecked on the Westralian coast, will
doubtless, when the Stinking Fish party gets its
second wind, be published as another Petriana
lie. Then, through the enthusiastic efforts
of the friends of G. Reid and B. Smith, it
will be told to the world how the six kept
weary vigil on the beach, armed with long
poles to shove the drowning Chows back into
deep water, and how, when they were all satis-
factorily drowned, the White Australia party held
a banquet to celebrate the event, and the first
toast on the list was “The Sharks,” with “The
Labor Party ” to follow.
There is talk of a municipal Hansard in
Sydney—talk which arises from the solidly un-
patriotic attitude of the daily papers in their re-
ports. Very little notice is taken of really good,
sound municipal work. A civic statesman may
make a speech bristling with valuable suggestions
and hardly attract a line of notice. But every
row or disagreement is reported with great detail,
so that the public gets an al together incorrect idea
of its representatives’ work.
It was only the other day that P.M.-G.
Mauger put his heaviest foot on a scheme to
supply postal officials with uniforms made in
China ; and now Minister Lyne is inquiring into
a contract made with a Melbourne firm for supply-
ing the Australian Government Printer with
copying paper “made in Japan.”. It looks as if
some of the Public Service chiefs were unduly keen
on blocking White Australia and Protection, and
in those matters there’s a point not far distant at
which Australia will start to take its coat off, and
maybe its boots also.
Evidently the weakness of the Oppo-
sition, and his own massive vanity, have per-
suaded Bent that he can do just what he
pleases. When, last session, Parliament voted
£90,000 to shire councils for the repair of roads
and bridges—this was over and above the annual
municipal subsidy of £lOO,OO0 —it was not sup-
posed that Thomas would distribute it according
to his own sweet will, yet that is what he has
actually done with the £50,000 that was allocated
in January. Also, he coolly refuses any informa-
tion as to how the amount has been distributed.
Prime Minister Deakin proposes to estab-
lish a Federal Agricultural Bureau, with the main
object of bringing the power of Australia to bear
on the suppression of the pests which afflict the
tiller of the soil. If Local Insect Wade does not
see a Wrong in this, the Ma State is clearly
betrayed by its trusted grumbler. Surely if any-
thing should be sacred to the State it should be
the potato bug and the hen louse and the various
worms, grubs, scales and other pests which afflict
the products of the soil. Let us arm in the
defence of our insects, and fight for all we are
worth against Federal interference.
“ N.” writes discursively :
The fatal shot to Portuguese Monarchy was the Brazil
revolution of 1889. The cablegramsagreed that it was an
ephemeral flutter, but the U.S. people knew better.
Under stress of Bonaparte, the Portuguese King and
Court removed to Rio in 1807. Stuck there till 1820,
when a Braganza branch was cut off for Brazil’s Emperor.
Portugal has only been under the Spanish thumb 60 years,
from 1580 to 1640. Mickle’s translation of Camoens’
Lusiad is wonderfully fiery and inspiring, but not so cor-
rect as Burton’s and two others. All four are in the
Melbourne Public Library, with a sumptuous edition of
Camoens, in Portuguese, presented by restaurateur De
Freitas, renowned for the 8 o’clock rush. The sniffs of
recent antiquarians have unearthed that Camoens was
mistaken in Portugal being the Roman Lusitania. That
region was all south of the Tagus.
Philp, Hanran, E. B. Forrest, “Kanaka”
Cowley, and Cribb were among the Queensland
Tories whom the postal vote saved from ex-
tinction at the recent elections. In each case
there is need for a close inquiry into the method
by which that postal vote came to be so strangely
and unanimously Tory. Also, there is need for
an Act completely abolishing the postal iniquity
save as regards people who are actually absent
from their electorates on polling day. The theory
that woman is such a timid, shrinking blossom
that she can’t be expected to go to the poll in per-
son, but should rather be called upon in the peace-
ful seclusion of her own home and bullied by a
hulking J.P. into voting as he pleases, is a fool of
a theory.
HIS DEFIANCE.
We to-day, if need be, will defy and destroy the unholy
Deakin-Labor conscription alliance by refusing to be
trained or to allow our sons to be trained in the hellish
art of war. I speak, at least, for myself when I say that
I will go to gaol and stay in gaol rather than be involved
in war or preparations therefor. —I am, etc., J. R. FIRTH.
Letter to S.M.H.
“ For God's sake, Mr. Constable, lock me up. I
can hear the enemy coming. But, mind you,
it's not fear on my part , it’s only principle.
When Tariff Bill Lyne proposed a duty on
fruit cases, to prevent a little of the waste of
Australian timber, and to give work to Australian
sawmill hands, the usual lie was told—the primary
producer was going to be taxed, and Australia
couldn’t make a fruit case, anyway. Now, in
Victoria alone, factories at Mornington, Har-
court, Gembrook, and Timboon are handling
hardwood that would otherwise go into the fire-
place, cutting it up into strips of standard sizes,
which the fruit-grower has only to nail together to
make into more durable cases than the pine make-
shifts he was using before. And that little bit of
Protection gives him his cases at 6|d. each, as
against the lOd. and he used to pay for the
imported articles.
Josh Symon and Jawbone Neild lately
wasted half one afternoon in the Senate in an un-
successful attempt to uphold their alleged dignity.
Senator Best, as Minister in charge, had made a
Ministerial statement on a question of policy.
Symon and the other claimed that they, as well as
Opposition-leader Millen, had a right of reply. The
Chairman of Committees stated that only party
leaders had the privilege of reply, and they said
they were party leaders. As Neild’s party con-
sists of Neild, and the Symon party is about two
strong, including Josiah himself, the Chairman
refused them a hearing. The irate pair appealed
to President Gould, and, after a long discussion,
Mary Ann fired them out of court. When last
heard of, the Symon and Neild parties were
making overtures with a view to a coalition.
“Mate”: It’s not only in strike time,
when they had some slight excuse, that deep-
water ships compete with coasters. Right now
there are two large steamers (chartered by Scott
Fell and Co.) discharging Newcastle coal in Mel-
bourne for the Victorian railways. They are on
deep-water wages and manned by colored crews.
This is unfair competition, and calls loudly for the
Navigation Bill, which is to stop that kind of
thing. How can we Australian sailormen force
decent conditions from Australian ship-owners if
they have to compete against the cheap nigger in
their own waters? It’s a much bigger thing than
the question of the Adelaide postmen getting
Chinese hats, about which such a noise was made
a few weeks ago. The coastal companies are lay-
ing their ships up ; and no wonder, if they have to
buck against opposition of this kind.
Bungaree, one of the richest districts in
Victoria, was recently informed by its banker
that its overdraft was large enough. Then the
shire councillors —mainly portions of the backbone
of the country-—howled dismally, and cursed Bent
because he would not give them any sub-
sidy for months yet. Finally, as there
seemed absolutely no other way outfit
was decided to get in the overdue-
rates; yet it was not till the col-
lector was ordered to issue sum-
monses that there was any rush
to part up. The mostly-well-
off land-owners held off to
the last moment, hoping
that something would
happen to save them
the indignity of pay-
ing their rates. An-
other, and a still
wealthier shire, War-
rnambool, has been re-
fused any subsidy at all
for one of its ridings,
wherefore, the most heart-
rending groans are to be
heard coming from strick-
en councillors, who will
have to let the roads and
bridges of that particular
riding go to pot, unless (perish
the unholy thought !) they agree to clap a few
pence in the £ extra on their present disgrace-
fully under-rated and still more disgracefully un-
dervalued land.
With an eye on the Commonwealth
Government’s proposals for universal military
training, Sydney D.T. discusses “Japan’s Place
in the World,” points out that the Monkey can’t
do much harm “while international conditions
remain as they are at present,” and concludes—
“ There is no immediate danger of a Japanese
invasion of Australia.” No, and there doesn’t
seem to be any immediate danger of Sydney
D.T. office being burned down ; yet, as conditions
may change, and the office may be burned down
some day—though it never has been burned down
so far—Sydney D.T. maintains an office down in
Kent-street stocked with reserve appliances.
Sydney D.T. seems to be a darned sight more
careful about its own future than it is about
Australia’s.
Redfern, which Labor-leader McGowen
represents in the State Parliament, is the first
metropolitan N.S.W. municipality to elect a
Labor mayor. But Broken Hill, which isn’t met-
ropolitan, has had a long succession of Labor
mayors, beginning with Jabez Wright, the pretty
v(ell-to-do undertaker, who somehow always
recalls the French Revolution. During the recent
elections Jabez was in Sydney, as Broken Hill’s
representative at the Political Labor Conference.
Before it was over, though, he had left the Con-
ference in disgust. The P.L.L. bosses, he says,
want to refer everything to committees, and hang
most things up till next year, and generally let
the ’bus go without them ; while the furiously-
energetic Barrier representative wants to catch
the vehicle, and use the whip, and make the
animals gallop.
“Nulla”: The news that the N.S.W.
State Government Printer has been rushing into
the heat of the semi-political stamp-printing con-
troversy recalls the experience of another highly-
placed N.S.W. official, some time back. He also
ventured into print—it was over the site of the
Mitchell Library—but, although he was the Aus-
tralian authority in his own particular branch, and
a man who has devoted a lifetime to the beauti-
fication of Sydney, his views came into conflict
with those of the Carruthers of the moment, and
he was promptly told that it behoved a public
servant to keep his opinions to himself. Of
course, nothing like that will happen to the
Government Printer. The Federal Government—
in N.S.W., at all events —is a thing that even the
State’s office kid may throw clods at with
impunity.
By “ Harrison O.” :
The Sydney Telegraph really makes me tired, there
are such a number of thing's it does not know—or does
not choose to know. It rouses all the worst passions
within me to think that it can succeed in ramming all
this rot about “ conscription ” down the throats of the
people who are brainless enough and anti-Australian
enough to spend their pennies on the rag. The Bulletin
has already exposed the lie that compulsory service is
un-British. It has shown how often this system has been,
recognised and sanctioned by Britain in the past; but it
will, no doubt, surprise the hysterical D.T. leader-writers,
who shriek in raucous voices and wave their rummy little
arms about, to know that such a system is even nowin
vogue under British rule in Egypt. There all male in-
habitants are liable for six years’ service in the army, five
in the police and four in the reserve. There are always
about 150,000 men on the rolls for CONSCRIPTION. (I
use the word for the special benefit of editor Ward, he
seems to like the sound of it so.) Just by way of a
peroration, I would like to point out to the violent Cab-
bage-tree Mob the difference between conscription and
compulsory training. When a man is dragged away from
his occupation and from his family, and forced to serve
his country whether he likes it or not for the fifteen best
years of his life (as in Egypt), that is conscription. When
the young men of Australia are given three weeks’ holi-
day every year, and are taught to shoot and boil a billy
and do a lot of other useful things, and are given.a bit of
pocket.money to spend when they get back, that will be
compulsory training.
More results of the Protective policy of
the Commonwealth. The other day, Buckley and
Nunn, of Melbourne, opened a new four-storey
factory, employing 100 hands, for the making of
high-class furniture. Better still, the standard of
wages fixed by the firm is higher than that pay-
able under the Wages Board’s determinations.
And still there are some Laborites who profess to
be Freetraders —or some Freetraders who profess
to be Laborites.
“Tryphena” (from London) gives a pic-
ture of a suffragette :
As 9he yelled Suffrage eloquence to the election crowd
she held on to a lamp-post (it was an unearned Bacchic
pose), finding the high office-stool that supported her an
uncertain matter. Every now and then she flung herself
precipitately at the audience in the tempest of her
oratory ; and then caught herself back to the lamp post •
and the light winked down upon her through a smeared’
glass, and her wild aspect, her threatening eye, her big,
vicious teeth and waving right arm made me think of a
she-devil driven to strong expostulation with contending
powers.
SKETCH AT MITCHELL (QUEENSLAND).
On the road to the Land Court to ballot for
prickly-pear selections.
.While Wade was shuddering about
municipal Socialism on the morning when N.S.W.
was to elect its new hundred thousand (or so)
aldermen, he ought to have turned to Paris, as
well as to London and America. There the
Socialists have a clear majority, and their pro-
gramme runs: —
(1) Care of the unemployed. (2) Development of the
Assistance Publique (what Wade calls “charity”). (3)
Building cheap and healthy dwellings for the poor. (4)
Feeding and clothing poor children going to school. (5)
Municipal ownership of gas and electric light supplies,
street-cars, omnibuses, motor-lines, steamers on the Seine,
metropolitan railways, and the undertaking business.
Already the municipality runs the 21 hospitals of
the city ; also it provides experienced midwives
to attend poor women at their own homes, and
asks no questions; and in its great maternity
hospital it cares for both mothers and children,
prying into no secrets, but simply giving help
where it is wanted. If only Wade had thoughtof
Paris !
N.S.W. Premier Wade, in his recent
municipal elections manifesto :
If you put Socialists into the municipal and shire
councils of this State, you are simply paving the way for
a majority of Socialists to enter the State and Federal
Parliaments.
Now was Wade afraid that, if municipal Socialism
was given a chance, it would make so good
an impression that the people would want to try
Socialism on a larger scale ? And if he didn’t
mean that, what did he mean ? If Socialism is the
dreadful thing that Wade says it is, he should be
glad to see Socialists getting into the municipal
and shire councils. Their administration would,
according to Wade, show up the disastrous
character of their policy, and discredit them with
the people ; and next election McGowen and his
friends would lose their seats, and Wade would
triumph. The Anti-Sosh Premier who says that
Socialism only wants a trial to make people
demand more of it, is a horrible failure.
THE MARTYR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Parliament was opened to-day by the King in person.
A member ol the Women’s Freedom League, holding a
petition, darted forward to present it to the King.
Members of the league carried banners bearing the de-
vice, “ Votes for Women.” The demonstration enraged
the crowd, and one of the standard-bearers was rushed,
and had her coat and hat destroyed.—English news item.
The woman wearing the simple hat, and the togs that are
striped like Willie’s,
She lifts her voice in the places where choice men-folk
flaunt their frillies.
Her cry goes up, “ 0, King, how long l” — and we get the
news by cable,
How the commoner brays, for his noble boss, “ As long as
we chaps are able 1 ”
And the clamorous, roaring Cockney crowd a nasty
wrath evinces,
As she plunges around in a seething mass of mayors, and
dooks and princes,
With lords and councillors scrowging by, and knights of
the [purchased] Garter —
And the populace sits on her neat Leghorn, and makes her
a gibbering martyr.
The woman wearing the icy smile, with a splendid speech
in her handbag,
She’d bring King Edward to his knees with a stunning
verbal sandbag,
And she climbs on the neck of the roaring crowd with a
crimson face, and screeches,
As the lord of the People passes by, “ Oh King ! Just heat
these speeches.”
And the blithering populace groans and howls, and
hollers its curses gory,
And falls, all wild, on the prophetess, and sad is that
woman’s story.
They don’t quite tear her limb from limb, in the way of
the Turk or Tartar —
But they cast her hat to the four wild winds, and her fate
is that of a martyr.
The woman wearing the granite chin, and the stiff
unyielding collar,
She claims the right o’ the native-born—to raise her voice
and holler ;
And the joyless John, with the weary eye, tears the mul
titude off her bonnet;
Yes, her cry is loud when she sees her hat with a mad
crowd trampling on it !
How the sons of the Empiah play the game in the face of
a common danger !
And fall on the British matron, same as they might on a
wild bushranger.
They ribbon her coat to rags, and her hat’s a job for the
refuse-carter,
But they leave her her boots and her tattered skirt—and
her job as a public martyr.

The unemployed
. Don’t seem annoyed
When Parliament’s beginning.
They stand around
On frozen ground
While Death their ranks is thinning
They don’t appear
To laugh or sneer,
Or scoff or jeer,
Or drop a tear,
But only cheer
(It’s very queer !)
When Parliament’s beginning.
The unemployed
Of food are void
When Parliament’s beginning.
They think Freetrade,
By Cobden made,
Is England’s underpinning.
Each weary wight,
In wretched plight,
Has not a bite ;
But it is right !
’Tis England’s might!
So cheer the sight
Of Parliament beginning.

A home dancing party, informally im-

can be carried through so easily with the
Edison Phonograph.
The other alternatives are hiring a small
orchestra, with expense and bother and taking up
the room, or some girl tied down to the piano to
grind out waltzes and two-steps when she would
much rather be dancing.
But the Edison Phonograph likes to play dance music. It never gets tired.
It gives you the music of a brass band or a stringed orchestra, as you like.

for ever ; but it will make your beauty outlast your
happiest anticipations, and probably win for you a beauty
you never realised you could possess. Not only does

NEVER A MEAL WITH COMFORT.
Indigestion Caused Sydney Woman Great
Suffering.
Heavy Burning Pain after Eating. Sick
Headaches. Lacked Appetite. Always
Languid and Weary. Cured by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills.
Indigestion Caused Sydney Woman Great
Suffering for over Eighteen Months.
In that Time She had Never a Meal with
Comfort owing to the Heavy Burning
Pain which Food Caused Her. She was
Cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
“I suffered very badly from indigestion,” said
Mrs. Lucy Hanbiry, 125 Albion Street, Annan-
dale, Sydney. “After eating, a heavy burning
pain came in my chest, and it seemed as if a big
lump was there. I always had a headache, and
the smallest particle I would eat would cause me
to have a cramping pain in the stomach. My
appetite was very poor, and at last I became afraid
to eat, because of the pain it caused me. I felt
languid and tired —as though it was too much
trouble to move. I had a doctor attending me
for a long time, but he gave me no relief whatever.
Through several friends of mine receiving relief
from Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, 1 decided to give
them a trial. After taking several boxes the pain
in my chest left me, and I was able to eat my
food. As my appetite got better I seemed to get
stronger, and I lost my headache. By the time
that I had finished another six boxes I was com-
pletely cured of indigestion.”
The tonic treatment for indigestion, dyspepsia,
catarrh of the stomach and gastritis is having re-
markable success in curing obstinate cases, and
deserves attention from every sufferer.
The principle is that remedies for indigestion
that digest the food for the stomach give relief for
only a short time. Ultimately they unfit the
stomach to do its own proper work, because they
make its already weak powers still weaker by
disuse, while the remedy that strengthens the
stomach makes it more and more capable of
digesting the food for itself; this benefit lasts. A
remedy that is a tonic not only for the stomach
but for the blood and nerves as well, invigorates
the whole system and makes recovery from the
weakening effects of indigestion rapid and
thorough.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are such a tonic, and
have proved themselves an ideal remedy for
chronic cases of stomach trouble. Sold by most
chemists and the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.

SEMPER IDEM
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, February 11, 1908.
My Dear Arint,—
Every paper in Sydney has burst into con-
gratulatory paragraphs on the extension by a
twelvemonth of Governor-Admiral Rawson’s term
of office. N.S. W. looks upon it as a compliment
that His Excellency and Missßawson should desire
to abide with us a year longer than they need,
The Smart-setters declare that the Governor is
an “old dear,” and that Miss Rawson is “a per-
fect pet.” The vocabulary of this group of persons
is limited, but its intentions are good, and in this
case it means what it says, though it doesn’t fully
convey its meaning.
The head of a Sydney girls’ school lately
demanded that the diaries kept by her resident
pupils be produced for her inspection. Possibly
the lady has read that the Principal of the ex-
pensive American school where the much-adver-
tised Evelyn Thaw of The Case was a pupil,
has been ruined merely because the fact became
known that she had such a Young Idea to
train. The girl had been sent to school
by her former lover, Stanford White, and the
diary she wrote up whilst a pupil was read in
Court when her lawfully-wedded lunatic was on
trial for murder. The poor school-marm, in her
insolvency exam., said she had spent £12,000
within the last year on refitting her school-build-
ings, and yet she had no more show of getting a
pupil than if she were dead. And all because
a damsel with a warm imagination, and a lock of
hair twisted into a note of interrogation, wrote
precocious things in a diary. Presumably the
head of that Sydney academy wants to overhaul
the diaries to see if there are any traces of
incipient homicide-by-deputy in them, and is
seeking for possible signs that the future of any
of the girls is lilcely to be a Past later on.
Authoritatively stated that Lipton—the one and
only Lipton—-arrives here shortly from Colombo.
He told a travelling Australian recently that if
he visited Sydney he would donate a yacht trophy
to be raced for by local craft. Length of practice
and purse has made of him an expert at this game.
He is the Carnegie of sport. Where the laird of
Skiboand Pittsburg gives a library, Lipton weighs
in with a 1000-guinea cup or something. Lipton,
among a glut of other attractions, is 6ft. high,
a member of the Marlborough, an intimate
friend of the King, and is the holder of the world’s
record for rejections from the Royal Yacht
Squadron at Cowes—the haughty institution that
won’t have a trader within its portals for tanks of
gold. Lipton is unmarried, yet it is said he is no
woman-hater, therefore the Australian girl may
put on the hat with most fowl in it, and go forth
in search of big game.
The Intelligence Department strikes a few
unsuitable immigrants amongst the batches it
brings out. An indignant woman who was
hawking post-cards last week explained to one
buyer that she, her husband, and her children
had come out under representations that the man
could find ready employment. He is a chauffeur.
He couldn’t get work at his calling, but on
all sides he was asked, “Can you milk?”
He couldn’t. He had never seen the trick. A few
nights he and his wife had to spend in the open
air, and their children, by the kindness of
an official, were allowed to remain at Ormond
House.
A noted doctor once said that “the public is
a great baby.” The phrase comes to mind when
one learns that the Civic League, which is a circle
within a circle of the Sydney Women’s Club, is
going to take a hand at leading the public to
higher things:—
The aim of the proposed league is to inform and
organise public sentiment in civic matters, and to pro-
mote the study, careful framing and systematic agitation
of measures of social improvement.
Its stairs, so to speak, are the following :
1. Sanitation of city. Street cleansing and watering.
Better kept sidewalks and roadways, etc.
2. Smoke nuisance— e.g., factories and ferry-boats in
Harbor.
3. Hoardings and other defacements— e.g., on city
front—at Circular Quay and other places.
4. Parks and playgrounds— e.g. , recent alteration of
parks—inartistic.
5. Widening of streets (city betterment)— e.g., beauti-
fying of city—of back yards and waste areas.
6. Watch and ward. (Care of public morals in prints
and pictures, mutoscopes, post-cards, books, etc.) Decent
streets. Amusements, etc.
One is sorry that the Civic League does not in-
clude food adulteration in the list of things it
means to keep a sharp feminine eye on. At
least it might threaten to throw its weight on the
person who adulterates milk. Adulteration of
infants’ food by so-called preservatives and water
ought to be made a more serious offence than, say,
shop-lifting. In the sanitation of the city and
street cleaning and watering campaign, the
League will have to prove its inventive
faculty. Some Leaguer may invent a means of
collecting the street-dust sweepings other than the
prehistoric method of to-day. No matter how high
or dry the wind, a biped employed by the Council
spades up a couple of quarts of street sweepings,
and with a swing as if he was bowling at
Gunn’s wicket hurls about a pint Pf it into
a cart. The wind carries about three pints
of the powdery refuse into shops and streets and
bakers’ carts and over the persons of other bipeds.
Meat in butchers’ shops gets a large share of the
many-microbed dirt. So does any exposed
food. The League would beleaguer well if
it worked against the indecent exposure of
food, and the needless handling thereof. If
the League wants some more tips, there is the
carriage of bread in the hands—the necessarilv
dirty hands—of the carters. Why not agitate for
a bye-law compelling bakers to enclose their loaves
in little card-board cartons, as,, I believe, is done
in some cities of the world now ? Woman can do
much good in politics if she will determine to
develop her “house-keeping” instinct on muni-
cipal and State lines. A lot of politics is just
house-keeping writ large.
Mr. B. R. Wise must have advanced long past
the stage where he could just sit up and take
nourishment. He seems now fit to move round
and battle for his nourishment. At the
annual meeting of the Central Emigra-
tion Board, held last week in London,
Mr. Wise lifted up his voice against the exporta-
tion of “ human driftwood ” to overseas dominions.
According to the cables, there were warring
elements at the meeting, and the opinions didn’t
all fall like the gentle rain from Heaven. If Wise
hadn’t been a fairly sound man he wouldn’t have
been firing off pointed periods at a strenuous
gathering.
It is announced that the work of collecting pic-
tures in London for the Melbourne Exhibition
next March has been completed. Nearly 50 tons
of Inspiration and Soul are understood to
have started by the Orontes, and many bags
and bales of Art left previously per the Afric.
The collection seems to cover a fairly wide
range. In landscapes there are works by Water-
low, David Murray, Alfred East and Leader, and
there is a seascape by the marine painter, Julius
Olsson. In figure subjects, the monumental
“Perseus and Andromeda,’’ by the late Lord
Leighton, and the “ Laus Deo ” of Solomon J.
Solomon, will be shown. Caton Woodville’s
“Saving the Guns” is another of the visiting
pictures. Twenty loan pictures from “noble
owners ” and public institutions will occur.
Countess Brownlow, sister of the Governor of
Victoria, started the loan collection with “The
Courtship of King Rene.” Dicksee’s “ Reverie,”
Byam Shaw’s “Love’s Baubles,” and Haynes
Williams’ “Ancestors on Tapestry” have been
lent by the Liverpool Corporation. And a col-
lection of 80 typical examples in etchings and a
quantity of proof-etchings will enrich the Ex.,
which ought to be worth travelling from here by
cattle-truck to see.
From a jolly girl in Wellington (M.L.): —
Went to hear Clara Butt at her third and last concert
on Saturday night. Between 3000 and 4000 people there.
It was a splendid programme, and most people—even not
musical cranks—were enthusiastic.
For the first time in Wellington at the Butt-Rumford
concerts the Town Hall authorities made thecommon crowd
at the door form a queue, and during the hour or so of wait-
ing we were uplifted and cheered by watching the police
chivvy into their proper places in the line women and
girls who were rebellious, and tried to sneak up the steps
and get close to the doors. We were there, a party of
nine strong. We had all wanted, with a terrific ache, to
hear Clara Butt; but January is a long and droughty
month after the wild orgies of the Christmas holidays,
and eight out of the nine were in a condition described
as “stony.” Muriel, the wise and far-seeing one, came to
the rescue. She had 15s. fid., intended for the purchase
of a pair of dancing shoes, hidden in an egg-cup, and she
offered to finance the crowd, and wait for the new shoon
until the summer sales broke out. We accepted the loan
thus floated, and promised to buy her a keg of chocolates,
and also pray she might never again suffer from corns.
While we waited in the crowd at the door of the
hall several little comedies amused us. There was
the woman with the 12-inch hat pin sticking
out murderously for half its length close to her
neighbor’s eye; the sensible woman who had the
courage to ask her to remove the weapon ; the angry
looks of the wearer of the skewer, who was inwardly
calling her “ cat ” for interfering ; the sentimental young
lady with elbow sleeves, transparent yoke and pearl neck-
lace who was reading an enthralling “sixpenny” called
“ Heart of My Heart,” and who was rabidly anxious to
find out whether She got Him ; the little man hidden
behind two fine young female Dotninionites, and who
shamelessly listened to their exchanged opinions about
the case of the bookseller who was prosecuted for selling
a copy of Thf. Lone Hand containing an alleged
naughty picture ; the large policeman, who came up
to those nearest the door and wearily advised
them to knock and hurry up the opening, as the
ladies in the line bevant were abusing him something
shocking; the young lady with a No. 5| hand, who
tapped on the trig door with a noise like a woodpecker
tapping on the Pyramids, and who was encouraged by the
hig policeman to “ try yer fut, Miss”; then the tardy
opening of half the main door, which I did not enjoy at
all, because the crowd made what my young brother
would call “ a blackguard rush,” and knocked me down
my full sft. 7£in. length, and but for the efforts of the big
policeman and the caretaker I should have been effect-
ually trampled on and all my worldly troubles ended. I
lay there just long enough to think about a kinemato-
graph picture I once saw of a man run over by a motor,
squashed flat, and then taken in hand by a kindly person
with a bicycle pump, who blew him up into shape again.
I had no hope of the pump being efficacious in my case.
However, I rose safely, adjusted my hat over both ears
instead of one, ran my fingers through my hair, shook
my skirts, and Miranda was herself again, and rejoined
the other eight girls, who had visions of a funeral, flower
wreaths, and a stone inscribed, “To Dear Miranda. Killed
in the Rush to Hear Clara Butt for 2s. 6d. Her End
was Squeeze.”
Miss Ruby Adams, the young soprano who
created a sensation at Sydney Town Hall re-
cently, sang to Melba at Albury last week. Aus-
tralia’s greatest artist was satisfied, and gave Miss
Ruby a letter to Marchesi—the marvel amongst
voice-grower 3. Miss Adams leaves on the 19th of
this month, and makes straight for Paris and the
strenuous life.
The Countess of Yarmouth (who was Miss
Alice Thaw, and sister of the architect-slayer and
New York degenerate of that ilk) has obtained a
decree of nullity of marriage against her skirt-
dancing husband. The suit was held in camera,
so the “grounds” are undisclosed. But, on
general principles, a man whose main hobby is
skirt-dancing ought not to be married, anyway ;
any more than should a woman who has aban-
doned all feminine vanity and wears close-cropped
hair and aggressively sensible boots “on prin-
ciple.” The wife of cricketer De Trafford, who
fluttered here the other day, is one of Yarmouth’s
sisters, and both are the offspring of the still un-
planted Marquis of Hertford.
Sydney’s stateliest school-marm, Miss Beatrice
Fullerton, was the most imposing figure in last
week’s “Engagements Announced.” She rules
Claremont College, at Randwick ; and ex-Maori-
land art-teacher Collins wins the first prize. The
lady is a grand-daughter of the late Henry
Clarke, for years “Father of the House” in
N, S. Wales. It was a sister of hers, Mrs. Austin,
who, marrying the keeper of a little manse in an
up-country township in S. Australia, spent the
honeymooning period in a dark-brown study, and
then rushed across to Sydney University to sit for
her M.A. degree, and take it triumphantly.
There are no end of ways, you see, of spending
the honey-month.
Clara Butt is to be personally conducted over
Rotorua by T. E. Donne, and will make ac-
quaintance, helped by that discreet guide, with
ts carved gods and demons and hot and cold
spouting water. She won’t find anything much
taller than herself unless it be Waimangu in
action, or Wairoa when it gets busy trying to
quench the sun or stars. Either the baths will be
deepened specially for the singer, or she will take
her course of treatment doubled up.
Talking of Maoriland concerns : Mr. Vincent
Ward, second son of Maoriland’s Premier, was in
Sydney last week. He departed by the Dorset
for “the Great Blot,” as some writer calls
London. Eldest Ward boy is to be married in
July to a Miss Davidson, a cousin of General
Babington’s wife and a niece of the Mr. Alovsius
Macdonald who car ves so much frozen substance
in R.C. circles. Another caller of last week was
Mr. Harcus Plimmer, chief of staff of the
Dominion. He got out of our sunshine back to
his own a few hours before brother Harry
appeared as the Tetrarch in the revival of
“Claudian.” Mrs. .Knox Gilmer (the May
Seddon girl) stayed to see hpr friend, Miss Ola
Humphrey, in the production, and will go back
next Saturday.
An Auckland visitor here is advertising for
a parlormaid to take back with her. One
of the inducements offered is a return saloon
passage to this city. (Australia is plagued
by the want of Mary Ann, but evidently
not so badly as Maoriland.) Looking over
the daily paper columns of “ Servants
Wanted,” one is struck by the cringing attitude of
the advertiser. Even to laundresses a bait held
out is “no washing.” Presumably the laundress
is wanted only for ironing jobs. “ Wanted a
competent laundress; no starched pieces, no
collars or cuffs,” is another bit of bird
seed. As for generals, “no washing or
scrubbing” is the regulation bait. Missuses
living across the water offer “ steamer ticket ” as
part of the inducement. As for the would-be
employees’ advertisements, the obvious point
about them is the outburst of refinement. Every
girl and woman wanting a situation in a bar, or as
a general, or lady’s-help, or inquiring for offices to
clean, is “refined.” It is a most catching qualifi-
cation amongst advertisers. When the “ refined
girl” advertises for a situation with a “plain,
homely couple,” and gets it, one wonders how her
refinement stands being rasped by the plainness
and homeliness of her employers. Sometimes
“ refined ” is replaced by “ genteel,” and then you
know the advertiser has been reading an Early
Victorian novel. That compulsory domestic
service for girls will have to come.
Mrs. Agnes Janson has been in Sydney for a
change of heat. She and Mrs. Slapoffski, on a
night last week, were the main guests at an
evening warble given by Dr. and Mrs. Le Brun.
Both ladies lifted their voices in song, and the
listening guests, sitting out in five acres of garden,
were glad that they had not been killed by a tram
on their way there.
Miss Mollie Toohey, a daughter of the late
James Toohey, senior partner in the Toohey
hrewery firm, is engaged to a young Maorilander
from Napier, Gleeson by name. He was a River-
view student. The James Tooheys—six of them
—leave for a European trip presently, so the
pair who are going to stand under a wedding bell
won’t stand there yet awhile.
Saturday’s heat got to be vicious towards night-
fall, yet a crowded audience braized itself at the
Royal watching Julius Claudian live through
a hundred years. Julius got a silver laurel
wreath and Miss Humphrey one posy. It was
a beauty, but it had no rival. Yet
twenty-three orders for bouquets for the artiste
had been lodged with two florist firms. Before
the sun went down upon their (the florists’) wrath,
every flower looked as if it had been boiled, and
twenty-three of the audience, not knowing the
cause of the trouble, composed reproaches to be
sprayed at florist girls on Monday.
In the melodrama “ Claudian,” Miss Ola Hum-
phrey, as Almida, has little chance for either
acting or frocking. The latter is Greek draping.
She displays three shades of yellow crepe-de-chine
in the first swathing, when, as the vigneron’s daugh-
ter, she comes on the scene smiling and chortling
through Love’s young dream—love for a superb
young blacksmith in a leopard skin. Then she
disports in three shades of blue cr£pe-de-chine in
the second swathing when—-blind, and grieving
for her new Love, the Prefect—she follows him
through the Byzantine city. The swathing and
draping are most cunningly and artistically
wrought by the artist herself. There are
dozens of yards of material and hundreds of
safety pins. The winding process begins at the
knee 3, and is continued up to the bust, where the
flowing, draping effect is achieved. Only a quite
slender, prettily-modelled figure would look any-
thing but fearsome in the series of fragile wrap-
pings, for the outline of the body is in evidence
from shoulders to feet. Miss Humphrey wears
sandals, and her own dusky coppery hair flows
loose to the early Christian winds.
Of course it is impossible to suppose that the
Greek women of that era looked in the least like
Miss Humphrey. In the hustle and clamor of
everyday life a woman couldn’t possibly have time
to begin dressing herself at the knees, and to
wrap 180yds. of gossamer clo’ round her 150
times, and fasten it with 140 safety pins. The
thing is absurd ; besides on washing-day the thing
would have had to be hung out to dry on a line
about 90ft. high, and even then the he-goat might
have come frisking out of Thrace and eaten the
ends of it.
At the Presbyterian Church, Neutral Bay, on
January 16, were wedded Marcus Ponsonbv
Brownrigg, eldest son of Crosbie Blake Brown-
rigg, of Neutral Bay, and Miss Adeline Con-
stance, daughter of A. K. Doyle, of North
Sydney. The bridegroom is grandson of an old
navy man, Captain Brownrigg, who was P.M. at
Albury for many years, and great-grandson of
General Brownrigg, who was offered the governor-
ship of N. S. Wales in succession to Bligh, but
refused on account of his wife’s ill-health. Con-
sequently Macquarie, the Sticker, got the job,
and hung on to it for nearly 12 years.
Wedded on July 29, at St. Stephen’s, Newtown,
by Rev. T. H. Sapsford, brother of the bride,
and Rev. W. F. Langley (double-parson-power
affair), Cortes R. Hodgson, M.D., 8.5., London,
to Janie, daughter of the late T. H. Sapsford’
Sydney City Architect.
Notice in the Abgus word of the marriage, to

is, excepting Richard Teece, of the A.M. P. Society,
the sole remaining son of William Teece, who
(with his wife Catherine) came to Sydney from the
Bay of Islands (Maoriland) in 1852, and went into
business as a tanner and boot manufacturer. The
Teeces were a brainy lot. One, ,T. ,T. Teee'e, was
Crown Prosecutor; another, Wm. Teece, r'epre.
sented Goulburn in the Assembly for some years-
and another had a position in the N.S.W. Mines
Department.
Artist W. A. Moir is showing portraits of
Captain Cook, Captain Phillip, and Viscount
Sydney at his studio. The pictures of Cook and
Phillip are copies of famous originals in the
British National Gallery. Viscount Sydney’s
Georgian face is taken from the original, loaned
for copying purposes by its owner, the Marquis of
Townshend. Captain Phillip is shown leaving
footprints on the sands of the seashore. His ship
appears on a blue sea background, and the
mariner wears the regulation unserviceable and
liable-to-blow-off cocked hat of his rank and
period. These pictures ought to be of interest to
Sydneysiders, but visitors seem to take more
interest in Mr. Moir’s very own original work, of
which he has many examples.
“Mario,” from Brisbane :
The elections are over, and the name of the Govern-
ment appears to be Mud. And what will happen next
except that the early resignation of the Chelmsford Lord
is looked for, it is hard to say.
The week has been one of goodbyes. Mrs. Brockwav
wife of one of our leading men, has been tea’d prior to
departing Fogwards with her interesting little daughter.
Then Miss Fewings has been busy saying ta-ta all round
pending a flight per Marathon to the land of Taffy, who
was a thief. Miss Fewings, it will be remembered,’is the
lady who raised a notable dust at the Brisbane Gram-
mar School some time ago. She has since run
the High School for Girls on the reputation of
that upheaval, and she now retires, her mantle
having fallen upon the capable shoulders of Miss
Constance Harker. Latter is a graduate of brilliant
polish—patent leather boots aren’t a circumstance to it—
from your own University ; she has lately spent three
years on the European Continent putting an extra
shimmer on her French and German. It is said that Miss
Fewings will devote some of her spare time to lecturing
to Taffy’s descendants in Wales. She is a stirring speaker,
and denounces in strong terms the pupil-teacher system
that is bringing the State schools into such appalling in-
efficiency.
•fas. Forsyth and his comfortable missis, who leave,
with their adopted daughter, for England by the Orontes
on Wednesday, are doing the usual round. “Jimmie”
was the guest of honor at a farewell dinner at the City
Club on Saturday evening. At that function you could
have cut the haggis accent with a bar of soap.
Old Mr. Alfred William Compignd, the last of the
original House of Fossils in Queensland, has been giving a
reminiscence or two in the papers. One fact that is not
mentioned, probably for fear of shocking possible descen-
dants, is that young Compignd’s nerves got a considerable
shock when, stepping ashore, on June 30,1839, he found
himself confronted by a gallows, upon which no less than
nine bodies swung fitfully in gruesome array. They did
things in a large way those times. The old man has now
topped 90, and in spite of failing strength and loss of sight
is in good spirits and robust in his mental equipment.
Like most folk of French origin, he talks as much with
his hands as with his face, and very agile indeed are those
hands.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 10, 1908.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Melba sang at Wangaratta last week. Wan-
garatta built itself a fine hall some years ago. On
the strength of this, and with a musical com-
munity to back up the hall, Wangaratta has
successfully drawn Paderewski, Dolores, and now
Melba, by guaranteeing a sizable audience.
Melba stayed at the Commercial Hotel. She
sent on ahead a hamper of luxuries and cold
game—partridges and such —also her own wine.
These were set out in a room in the hotel awaiting
the returning warbler’s appetite. A hungry, thirsty
traveller got into the room by mistake, and selected
a nice plump bird for demolishment; also wine
from off the ice, and other luxuries. He remarked
inwardly that for a supper in a country hotel the
“blow-out” was far beyond his expectations.
The concert over, orders went out for the supper.
Then the outrage was discovered. They say
Melba’s anger was not fit for publication.
Florence Young is ill with a poisoned throat,
and Dr. Strong is in attendance. She had to give
up her part in “ Humpty Dumpty,” and the
world is a trifle darker by reason of her eclipse.
Another explosion in the Anglican Church.
Not a canon this time, only a gun, but a big one.
He sails for Japan and foreign parts; and his
wife, with a quiver of fledglings, goes to England.
His particular church has come under notice a
good deal within the last few years.
The sensation of the week in social and com-
mercial circles is the “hammering” of a man
whose engagement to one of Melbourne’s prettiest
girls had just been announced. Congratulations
were still pouring in when the financial bomb
burst.
Several Bulletin correspondents want to know
Canon Nash’s offence. To satisfy them, I asked
one of St. Columb’s lady teachers what his “ nibs ”
really did, and got this lucid reply : “He didn’t
do it; and, even if he did—but he didn’t.” So
there you are, and I hope everybody’s satisfied.
We may expect a scandal in high life within a
month or two ! Divorce ! ! and the folk are two
of our aristocracy. The lady, ’tis said, petitions.
The husband is taking his ease, and seems to
regard his imminent ejection from his missus’s
bosom with huge equanimity, and won’t defend
himself very strenuously. A protegee of his
declares that she will be his wife in real earnest
when a decree absolute returns him to bachelor-
hood, and she enlarges upon the sort of perform-
ance she’ll give in the legitimate play. Alto-
gether “ sassiety ” has every right to expect a
horrible scandal, and it is grateful.
This impending disunion and a bad many
others point out to foolish woman—or they should
—the unwisdom of wedding the moral agricul-
turist, whose hobby is sowing wild oats. Of course,
every female likes the man who is capable of
setting the oats in attractive patterns, but
they ought to be all set before marriage.
The lady wants to know that he can do it; she
wants him to have done it because that is the
only possible proof that he can do it; but she
doesn’t want him to do it any more.
Charming Madge Mclntosh quits Melbourne
next week, and leaves behind her an interesting
acquaintance-list. The usual mob of leading-lady
worshippers haven’t found her peculiarly amusing.
Her adorers have been the unexpected ones—the
preoccupied young men who take an argumenta-
tive interest in national drama, the women with
aspirations towards intellect, and serious, weighty
folk who like to hear the lady’s quite incandescent
criticism of G.B.S. and Celtic singer Yeats.
Miss Mclntosh has been one of a London coterie
that numbers a host of alluring folk. The little
Madge is one of the exceptional women who prove
the rule that actor-folk have mere instincts, and
not intellect, as their vital spark.
That experienced heavy villain, mummer Mer-
vale, is trying to find an antidote for the attacks
of entranced young women who worship his stage
wickedness. He has struck an unactor-like admix-
ture. He is going on tour with a bristling black
moustache and his clear-colored wife to chaperone
him.
A lordly personage for a long time infested our
most superior hostelry. There he gained much
trade credit, and the affectionate regard of two
matrons. It was a pretty play, the gentleman
angling for love and lucre with no more material
bait than his pretensions. The ladies—life-long
friends—shared in their charming Platonist until
he showed an access of admiration for the elder of
them. Then t’other quarrelled bitterly with her
rival, but still remained an ally of the man of con-
tention. (Which is characteristic of a woman—
she has such an adjustable sense of justice !) Now,
the dear women are reconciled, and a hungry
legion of creditors is engaged in causing the arrest
and return from a far country of the lordly
personage.
The atmosphere of Melbourne is thick with
gossamer just now. If you haven’t five yards of
veil streaming back from your top-hamper, other
gorgeous sartorial elements avail nothing. The
veils are voluminous, and usually silky and cling-
ing. Take a bunch of ninon, chiffon, or crepe-de-
chine, and throw it at a brick. It grips like an
octopus. Three yards of chiffon in twin tails and
an unshaven chin are the elements of a common
tragedy on the Block. I witnessed one in front
of Allan’s. The skirt-length with the floating
tentacles was bounding east; the lank man with
the unshaven chin was butting west. The
chiffon floated across, and gripped his bristles.
Then came the shock. The accumulated force of
her easterly impetus and his westerly rush nearly
tore her head off. As it was, the hat came away,
and the hair came down, and a dismantled lady
was led tottering into a convenient hat shop to
recuperate. The man received a bad wrench to
the neck, and was reduced to the ignominy of
having to collect his store teeth off the sidewalk.
If you don’t shave regularly beware of floating
chiffon.
A man who is old and married enough not to
notice such things, sends me this :
She outfit to have been auburn-haired with sea-green
eyes ;as it was, night shone in both hair and eyes. But
her skin was ivory ; and from head to heel she was
apparelled in bronze-green. Hat, blouse and skirt, belt
of coppery bronze, shoes and stockings. I admit it wa
these last that caught my eye. I have seen scarlet, white,
brown, and water-colored—but never, before now, this
browny-green. And as the wicked wind in the Melbourne
street blew the silken garments taut, her figure showed
like a bronze Circe. But a living Circe.
A frantic screed from a Maoriland lass heralds
an important discovery. “Did you notice what
a general resemblance there is between ‘Blue
Moon’ Kennethand Kennerleyßumford ? They’re
wonderfully like in manner, and appearance too.
And really Kenneth’s singing reminds one of
Kennerley’s. Of course, being married and so on
has made Mr. Rumford more serious. Still they’re
awfully like ! ” Of course they are a little inno-
cent in Maoriland ! Except in externals there’s
seldom a ha’porth of difference ’twixt one success-
ful tickler of feminine ears and another. A senti-
mentality that slops over on to the front stalls,
and a pair of large, active eyes, and a leg —as
Mrs. Mountsteuart Jenkins remarked, “ most
decidedly a leg ” —are the attributes that all truly
gifted baritones must share that they may snare
nimble dollars. Other characteristics are only
useful to engage the emotional attentions of their
sister artists.
Mrs. Wich4, a charming dame with artistic
gifts, the other day completed a decorative
scheme in the way of window curtains. On a
ground of white washing-silk she twined graceful
wreaths of native flowers and ferns. Now her
handiwork is the prettiest item in a beautiful
room. If oversea fabric weavers could see such
successful adaptations of our flora, we might be
blessed with some new drapery details of beauty.
The only civilian son of Colonel Hoad makes
up for the want of gold lace by strict attention to
ordinary attire. The Exquisite parades a suit of
such verdant green that Collins-street keb horses
bite at it. He whispers darkly of other gear too
vivid for Melbourne in the city’s present state of
sartorial darkness—coats with hip-pleats and
waists that grip ; dress suits of plum color and
blue facings ; joys kept in the tissue paper of a
glory box till they dare see Australian light. The
civilian youth captains a regiment of gilded cubs
who hang with awe on the decision of the Just-
Returned in socks or ties, and gloat over the care-
fully practised “ Oxford accent.”
An open-air performance of “As You Like It” is
to be done in the Ross-Soden garden. The idyll
will be played in the interests of amateur vanity
and sweet charity.
The young person with whom one of our local
Aristocrats usually shares his theatre box is back
again. The other day I came upon a small staring
crowd. She was its centre. She was deserving
of some notice. She reminded one of a bouquet
of Baudelaire’s verse. Her length of flesh and
bone, with its crest of copper hair, was
miraculously adorned. A quite short skirt showed
a pair of bird-like ankles and shining slippers; an
18th century coat, ruffled, brocaded and flowing,
blew back from a quaint pastel waistcoat. Her
hair was coiled peruke-like, and she faced the
world armed only with an ivory cane and her self-
possession. It was a memorable spectacle.
The German Opera Co.’s tour leaves a loss of
£298. Poor impresario ! After all the worry
inflicted on him by the song-birds, who wouldn’t
sing, and the shareholders’ womenkind who
would, even though they weren’t wanted (G. M.
confessed that he couldn’t make up his mind
which nuisance was more intolerable.) It’s highly
improbable that we’ll get another Wagnerian
menagerie for a while, for a variety of reasons.
Apparently high art in Australia —when the art is
too beastly high—doesn’t earn ice for its lager-
bier, and plump prima donnas conduce to
domestic disruption. Cryptic? No ! very obvious
to those in the know—especially the last clause.
Mistress Isa Bell —a matron who boasts five
bouncing babes, ranging from three to fourteen
years—has issued a challenge to Australia. She
tears off her trained skirt and her toque, and
standing erect in pedestrian garb, bids any women
who dare, race her over any stipulated distance for
the usual sporting considerations, and the title
of champion woman runner of the Commonwealth.
The sport, who is 36 years old, says that she has
done 150 yards in 17£ seconds—and she doesn’t
doubt probably in her valiant heart that she could
do the hundred in even time. Should no one—
either male or female—accept her gage, she
threatens to adopt the championship title without
further ado. It will be interesting to see if the
Australian girl can be fast in other fashion than
metaphorically.
The Rummy Ratu Khadavu of Fiji is a much-
petted individual, but he received a shock the
other day when his whim clashed with Queen
Melba’s. The Ratu has a little way of showing the
Glad Hand by bestowing the Order of the Whale’s
Tooth on people. Ex-Justice Holroyd, king of the
Savage Club, got the offer of a cetaceous molar ;
so did Melba. She graciously named a
spare quarter-hour to get the tooth. The
Fiji man failed to arrive. His cricketing
lieutenant fumed about the hotel and spent all his
eloquence in apologies for the delay, then rushed
off and cabbed wildly round the city looking for
the lost chief. He turned up late, placidly smil-
ing. Melba nearly threw The Tooth at his head,
and rated him soundly. His Darkness is still
cogitating the matter.
Miss Elsie Gillespie, daughter of the Men-
tone Gillespies, wedded one Frederick William
Welford, a Maorilander, last week, at St. John’s,
Melbourne. The weddin-g was quiet, but exceed-
ingly frocky. The bride was in “silk and satin
and silver and lace.” Four bridesmaids helped
in the brilliant flummery— two sisters and Misses
Burton and Watt, softly frocked in white, with a
telling touch of color in masses of pinky-blue
hydrangeas. Two brothers, Harold and Stanley
Gillespie, backed up the bridegroom. Mrs. Wel-
ford went away in navy cloth tailorings, and an
adorable hat, all dull-blue droopy plumes.
Another last-week wedding was that of Miss
Irene Earle, of “ Elrae,” Richmond, who mar ried
barrister Sam Leon’s only son, a youthful and
rising medico.
By the Orontes we will lose quite a personality
in Carl Bogue Luffmann, a man of parts, who has
been in the public eye, off and on, in this State
for some thirteen years past. He is the adored
of women students of the Government School of
Horticulture at Burnley (of which he was princi-
pal). The gardening maidens have presented the
departing one with a travelling bag. Other ad-
mirers will ask him to accept a purse of sovereigns.
Before coming to Australia LufFmann published
“A Vagabond in Spain,” a result of personal
wanderings. It is probable that he will again go
on the wallaby, or its European equivalent. At
present the energetic gentleman is busv hurling
burning letters, at our elongated Minister for
Agriculture, who, he asserts, is responsible for his
departure. The Minister is kept busy composing
epistles of the same warmth embellished with re-
marks about Carl’s eccentricities. Minister Swin-
burne relates how he (the same Carl) wept in his
office. The Bogue man hits back with : “It may
be true that he has caused me to blush—for him—
and to weep bitter tears for myself ; but, after all,
tears help to keep the world clean.”
LufFmann had a rare collection of brass and
copper of ancient Spanish date that has been
quickly snatched by collectors. He is an enthu-
siast on “ form,” architecture and design in park
and garden. He leaves the mark of his influence
on many Toorak and Kew gardens, chiefly through
women students who caught his enthusiasm.
Paymaster Tracey, of the Nelson, has been pro-
moted to third class in the Federal service.
Lady Holled-Smith (when her husband was in
command on the station) discovered this Beau
Brummell in the Defence Department, and
floated him into notice.
At Saturday’s Test match Mrs. Potts, the
Blanche Wallace of other days, looked large and
beautiful set into a close framework of men.
Another Test figure was Mrs. Archie Burt,
of Westralia, formerly the lovely Florrie Roberts.
This is the tail of the tale of two tabbies.
Tabbies were in the habit of drifting and frivol-
ling together for quite a while. And frequently
they invaded a well-furnished restaurant to enjoy
their fish and milk. One fine day, tabbies fell out,
with arching of backs and horrid hissings. Next
morning the restaurateur received a note —a feline
shriek and unsigned. It bade him go forth to a
suburban household, taking a posse of policemen,
and there he would find a fine collection of his
cafe silver. Being a chivalrous chef he did nothing
of the kind. He merely mentioned his knowledge
to Oat No. 1, and suggested that his silver finger-
bowls looked better on his tables than they
possibly could piled with hair-pins on hers.
Oat One had a fit of hysterics, and promised the
return of the goods. Immediately she sought the
sanctum of Cat Two, and stole away with her
share of the plunder. This the man of hash
thankfully received in due course. One purloin-
ing puss lost her reputation; t’other lost her
silver. The puss who hates her sister in iniquity
most is the latter Cat.
The Thos. Hugheses are at Menzies’ for the
week. The family has just returned from Tassy,
where it motored some.
The Wilmot “George” girls joined the big
crowd of Macedonia passengers for a London
jaunt. Sister Mrs. Lindley takes the running of
the Wilmot house in the meantime. Mine-
manager Loring and his frocky American wife
departed by the same boat for a short trip. Miss
Topsy Conn farewelled the whole party at an iced
and violet-tinted luncheon, with soft music laid
on to cool the Hades atmosphere of this glorious
city.
Miss Connie Usher, the sweet music-maker,
returns from Maoriland and Tasmania to get
ready for her wedding in Sydney, in April. Miss
Usher is to marry Mr. Baikey, chief officer of the
Yawata Maru. Preparations for the wedding
point to something lofty and extra. Rose-color is
to be the appropriate tint of the whole show.
From “Rosna,”in Adelaide :
We have achieved a sensational robbery, just to relieve
the monotony of things. There were several small
robberies by way of preface. First of all the Edwin
Smith mansion and a number of other houses were
burgled, but only to a small extent, though in one in-
stance the family valuables were unaccountably left
scattered on the law®. These matters were kept a fairly
dark secret—a sort of pale-black mystery—to enable the
police to look round. Finally, however, the thieves got
into “ Payneham ” early one evening, and Mrs. Stewart’s
jewels, to the value of £BOO, were carried off. The victim
is one of our most hospitable and generous dames, and a
notable frocker, and she had some beautiful trinkets. No
trace of the vanished loot has been found to date.
In another recent burglary case hereabouts the thief
was a gentleman of taste. He entered the house of a
newly-married couple, and annexed, among other things
the bride’s wedding dress, a parasol, gloves, soap, scent
and several rare editions from the library. The things
were found in the house of a maiden, towards whom he
was suspected of tender leanings. Evidently the girl was
no mere ’Arriet or Hemma when her lover wooed her
with rare editions and classics and such-like, instead of
with boiled lollies.
News comes from Britain that Adelaide actor Otto
Heggie is about to dive into matrimony, the happy
damsel being a fellow mummer.
Another stray South Australian in Edward’s Island,
Charles Gosse (son of the late Dr. Gosse, of this holy town),
is engaged to Miss Beryl Nicholas, who hails from that
sp®>;k in the Southern Ocean where mail boats call for
apples—the speck that tips up if you put four apples on
one side of it.
“The Squatter’s Daughter,” just now undergoing all
manner of trials and tribulations at the Royal, had a
really ecstatic welcome in this hot but robust town.
The first night every seat in the house was grabbed soon
after 7 o’clock, and crowds of disappointed folk had to go
dejectedly home without a glimpse of the Pastoralist’s
Offspring. Even now, after a run of more than a week (a
long run for a play in Tortoiseville), throngs of enthusiasts
crowd at the back of the circle every night and stand
through the whole performance, sometimes on one leg,
and then on the other when the first leg is worn out.'
Even Julius Knight didn’t command such houses ; in fact
we haven’t seen anything like it since “ Mother Goose ”
came this way. Evidently pantomime and yellodrama
just about reach Adelaide’s average of intellect.
Once more hath Blanche Arral eluded us, after working
us up to a pitch of expectation that was terrible in its
intensity. Two days before her concert was due, she
sent word that the air of Slowbart had played marbles or
ducks and drakes, or bumble-puppy, or some old game
with her health, and her medico had ordered her to cease
warbling, and rest. The booking was not all it should
have been anyhow, so perhaps the little lady was wise.
All the same, we feel the insult considerably, and we
now say that Mrs. Arral is stout, badly dressed and
over-rated. And if we can think of any other nasty thino'
to say about her we will say it.
The Clem Hill baby is not to be permitted to forget her
male parent’s prowess in the cricket field. She has had
yet another trophy hurled at her defenceless head this
time in the form of a brooch—“l6o” in diamonds’on a
gold bar, with a gold bat and ball suspended from it bv a
fine chain.
The Fred Scarfes are among the latest Britain-gadders
from this side. They sailed by the Macedonia last week
taking their small picture infant along with them Bv
the same boat the W. Popes sailed off to the land which
our ancestors had the sense to quit before we were born
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.
Evidently before there can be peace anc
goodwill in the Newcastle mining district then
will have to be found a means—by electrics'
machinery or otherwise—to spank a sense of re
sponsibility into the coal pit boys. These lads
fresh from school, suffering—many of them—from
the first consequences of the cigarette habit, have
the power now, for the sake of the merest whim
to stick up the collieries by a strike. When a pit’
boy wins ss. backing a pony, and lays in an exlra
stock of cigarettes, there may be a strike until he
and his mates have smoked them. To have the
fate of a big industry dependent on the reckless
whims of a few boys is intolerable, and demands
some remedy ; an effective spanking machine is
the best The Bulletin can think of.

Desks.
Did you ever sit at a roomy Roll-top Desk ? It
is an office in itself. Nothing can take its place
for comfort, convenience and appearance. Our
Roll-top Desks are modern in every feature, have
centre drawer, five-ply writing bed, raised cross-
panelling, and the massive square effect that has
always been and always will be so popular.
Selected oak, finished in any way you may
desire. Our stocks are complete, and our low
prices are based on the one-profit plan. Write
and tell us the style of desk you have in mind,
and we will supply, post free, all particulars.
Safes.
A Fire-proof Safe is a first essential to every
business man. Your records are your only means
of establishing a claim with your insurance com-
pany. Your books of account, receipts, stock
sheets, etc., are worth a great deal, yet they can-
not be insured. A reliable safe makes you secure.
The Safe we supply has a perfect record of
nearly forty years throughout Australasia. Im-
provements in construction and locking device
have been introduced, and there is to-day no more
reliable safe made. Write for a description of the
new keyless lock, and receive our new catalogue.
Your Office
is
TalKing*.
It speaks plainly to every man who enters.
You do not hear what it says, but the message is
delivered nevertheless. The silent message, the
impression given to a possible customer or client
by a barren, ill-arranged shabby office, may cause
. the loss of hundreds of pounds sterling in a year.
A man stepping into your office does not need
to be a mind reader to know that if you are pro-
gressive enough to adopt time-saving, mistake-
avoiding, modern office equipment in the conduct
of your affairs, you are careful and progressive
enough to be entrusted with his.
The good old days, when any place was good
enough for the office, and anything good enough
for its equipment, are past. To-day, Business is
recognised as a Science, and to prosper the Business
Man must equip his office with modern Appliances
and his Brain with modern ideas.
It is our business to supply all that is proved in
the way of Office Equipment, and the best current

“Snell” : There was a great fire raging in the
city. The mighty tongues of flame licked at the heavens
“ with a resolute endeavor now, now to sit or never by
the side of the pale-faced moon.” Great, rolling billows
of sparks and smoke filled half the sky, and the luddy
glare lit up miles of buildings. Presently the motors
came speeding in from the suburbs the big, shiny, black
motors, and the great red motors all glittering with nickel,
and the long, yellow motors resplendent with burnished
brass. The motors came like living things, panting and
agitated. The first was Nosenbloom’s, and “Mithith
Nothenbloom ” was sitting beside Nosenbloom, and there
were three little Nosenblooms ; and all were transported
with ecstasy at the sight of “ der beaudiful fire.” Flegel
H'legeltaub was in the next motor, and the Misses r legel-
t mb • and old grandfather Flegeltaub—who is 100 and a
cripple—was on the back seat, wrapped in blankets.
The veteran Flegeltaub’s head poked out of the
bundle, and his old eyes danced, and he joined
shrilly in the eloquent appreciation of “ dot mosd
lofely fire.” Then came the Offstems, and the Goldbergs,
and the Morrishes, and the Finkinsteins, and the Gold-
steins, the great procession of the rich Yids, on their
expensive motors, and all the motors swarmed with little
Yids, and far and wide sounded the Hebraic adjectives in
innocent appreciation of “ Der preddy fire Der mos
magniffcend fire ! ” 1 stood aside and listened, and my
heart went out to those dear ingenuous children of Israel
bubbling their rapture, their almost sacred adulation of
the mighty element in its unrestrained magnificence.
Now, in my calmer moments, I want to know if there is
a strain of the Parsee in the average Hebrew, or is tins
development of fire-worship a comparatively modern in-
stinct, based on policy—insurancejaolicy, for mstance t
Bent’s Licensing Act, passed the session before
last, has been kind to Captain Vallange, owner of two
small shops and the old ltose, Thistle and Shamrock
Hotel, alongside the burnt-out Wallach s building in
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne. The pub stood the fire, but
a slab of Wallach’s wall fell on it a day or two afterwards,
wrecked the building, and broke the water pipes under-
neath. The foundations sank, and the old Rose sagged
like a snake climbing a wire fence, so the Council ordered
its demolition. Under the old Licensing Act, Vallange
must have either rebuilt or forfeited the license ; but the
new measure allows him to surrender that valuable
article and claim compensation—which he has done, the
Cold-tea party views this as wholly iniquitous, and
though the demolition of the hotel was manifestly an
“ act of God,” Mudkins and co. are understood to be very
much displeased about it. r
“ G. Hard ” : Re weight of cornsacks. To
allege, as Cocky’s press friends are doing, that the four-
bushel bag 1 weighs only ‘2401b., is pure guff. The so-called
standard cornsack is certainly supposed to hold four
bushels when new ; but if wet, or wetted and weathered,
it will hold easily a bushel more. The 3151 b. bags are not
cornsacks, but “ washed sugars,” and could, I think, be
made to hold close on 4481 b. Bent will prohibit these,
but apparently will not interfere with the standard corn-
sack, described above. The average citizen has no idea
of the amount of labor Cocky puts into ramming his
wheat bags, often going over them again when they hav°
slackened by standing out in the weather. It is by frit-
tering his time on such futile “ economies that Cocky
stretches his work from daylight till dark, even in the
summer time. ,

“Tame Cat”: Out of the N.S.W. Miners’
Accident Relief Fund—to which every man working on
every sort of mine except the very smallest has to contri-
bute —the member laid up through accident gets 15s. per
week. At least, that is what he is supposed to get. But
he must present two medical certificates—the first stating
that he can’t work, and the second later on stating that
he can —and in some districts for these certificates he
has to pay ss. each. So if he is off a week he gets os.,
and the doctor gets 10s. Can’t some arrangement be
made wdth the Government Medical Officer (nearly every
town has one) to perform this service? Obviously, at
present the object of the fund is being defeated in such
cases as I have described.

The Royal Insurance Company has purchased
from Messrs. D. and A. Brown the land in Spring-street,
Sydney, abutting on Pitt-street and extending through
to O’Connell-street, and intends to erect its offices on the
site. In Governor Bligh’s time the land was a portion of
a lease belonging to Sergeant Thomas VVhittle, designated
bv Bligh a “most infamous character.” The Brown wine
and spirit firm was founded in 1827 in George-street.
Later on it removed into Bridge-street, No. 2, the build-
ing used at one time as the Synagogue, and still standing.
(It has been occupied all its days by religion and rum.)
In the early ’forties the Browns returned to George-street
in the neighborhood of the General Post Office, where
they remained until 1852, when they shifted to Spnng-
street. Eighty years is a fairly good record in “ wines
and spirits.” * . *
Byron Bay, on the N.S.W. North Coast, owns
the biggest butter factory this end of the planet. Last
half-year it turned out 3,417,2731 b. of butter ; that is to

shipped straight away to London. She is an energetic

“ Jean SiW ” : A real good thing is this Tariff of
ours. Last week, I found myself in the Customs Depart-
ment of the Parcels Post at Melbourne G.P.O. A stupen-
dous official from a British fire insurance co. was h av i n £
a small discussion. It transpired that his company had
received a blue document requesting the payment of
16s. Sd., being: short postage on 10 pm* nery
from England, which amount the young man paid, ex
pectin"-to receive the parcels. But a mere bloke behind
the counter informed him that the stationery (receipt-
books, I believe) was dutiable, and that, aocordinglj . he
would have to produce the invoice and manufaciturer s
certificate of origin before their conversation v,ould be
continued. The young insurance “ an wm in a state oi
collapse, and painfully admitted that he. could produce
neither invoice nor certificate as his so “ ethl "°“
head-office was too silly to supply either 1 'earntsubse
quently that he had to declare per Customs entry that
the value of the lot was £lO. The iniquitous Australian
Tariff smote the amount heavily in this way .

“ Chopper ” : I want an introduction to one ot
those terrified capitalists whom the Heraldgraph bogies
have not quite succeeded in shooing off , for■ I can p
my finger on the raw material of a p r o fi t a b 1 ei n d u s t ry,
and I want him to work it. Formerly the Australian
axeman paid from Is. upwards for a Yankee axe-handle.
Since Lyne’s tariff arrived we pay an extra twopence or
more as a hint that we are asses to pay anything at all
for American handles when we could have better Aus
tralian ones. Our forefathers, the pioneers, worked
up the water-gum into axe handles, and the
Yankee handle was despised as the mark of the
new chum. But we of the languid generation seem con-
tent to merely bear of the wondrous water-gums, silky
smooth and bending like whalebone, that let the first
burst of sunshine into most of our coastal river scrubs.
Scarcely one of Australia’s young axemen will spend a
wet day making a handle for himself. Yairs . he 11
remark, “ they must have been great handles. Then he
rides over to the shop and spends 10 minutes testing a
Yankee stick which probably goes “ bung first tree he
tackles. The water-gum, a beautiful timber totrim, arid
superior to any hickory, is abundant along the N. S. Wales
coastal rivers. The requisite plant to turn handles out
wholesale could not be expensive.

“Agricola”: Those benevolent firms which
give magnificent rolled gold, solid silver watches, jewelled
in 17 holes and warranted for 14 years, as a reward for
selling three packets of postcards at 2jd. each, or four
boxes of sample pills at 9d. a box, must be immediately
suppressed, otherwise the teaching profession will be
compelled to hump bluey in large squads. The terms,
“Send no money—simply your address,” encourage no
end of kids to pass along a postcard and then start out
hawking. They reckon the teacher is their first meat
and a sure thing ; and it requires an extra stony heart to
rei.-.se the pleading glance of your best worker, especially
when ! t’s “ Only sixpence, sir." I myself have sfi u ? n "
deredm.-'h lucre on patent medicine samples, which I
have dropp. d into the creek. The postcards I manage to
distribute as u wards for punctuality, etc. But its get-
ting so now, that 'f I see a youngster bucking in extra
heavy, I look for tlm bulge in his coat, where I suspect
the sample packet to .urk. The pill sample casteth its
shadow before it.

“ Araemo ” : He was small, alert, self-confident,
ao-ed about nine or ten, and the possessor of an Eye, also
a "chin. He stood purposefully outside the M.C.C. ground
durim'- the second Test match. To my query he answered :
“I’m waitin’ till lunch-time. When lunch-time comes
I’ll get in fer nix. I ask coves fer their pass-out checks.
Yesterday I got three, so I tore them in halves and sold
five halves to some kids for 2d. each, and got in on the
other myself. I saw the match that way and had a profit
of 10d., besides what I made inside by filling bottles of
water and selling them. On hot days I get 2d. for a beer-
bottle full of Water and Id. for a soda-water bottle. I
think I’ll make about five bob out of this match. Say,
how is it for a sprat to get me in this afternoon in case I
don’t get any checks? Thanks. You needn’t put any
other kids up to this game, mind ; too many’d kill it. I 8
that fag you’re smoking an orphan ? Thanks. You don’t
happen to have any cigarette cards on you, I suppose?
No Well, so-long; hope our chaps ’ll win.”

“ Knop ” : Re the enterprise of the Australian
kid. Know one, aged 11 years and some days, who has
started business as a stock-raiser. He has a line and con-
stantly-growing connection, and a substantial annual
turnover. It is his custom to present courteously to any
likely buyer a business card, whereon is printed with a
cheap rubber stamp, the words, “Bill Brown, white
mouse breeder.” Thereafter he produces an aged account
book and endeavors to book orders at 9d. a pair. Bill is
troubled in his venture neither by droughts nor wire-
netting problems, and is wont to boast genially that he
is one of the few primary producers who has never
crawled to the Government for State aid to his industry.

“W.J.A.” tells of the gain (and loss) of an
ultra-sensitive employee :
“ I was a draper, religious, and a hater of lies and liars.
Mv opponent in the same line two doors away announced
a great reduction sale of 30 per cent, on former prices,
‘ for one month only.’ Fairs and bargain sales were un-
known in our tow'n prior to that. During the whole of that
month my 14 idle employees would scrape, bow and kow-
tow to any straggler who happened to miss the great sale
practically next door. Bankruptcy stared me in the face.
At the expiration of that sale, I beckoned my opponent’s
foreman, and began : ‘ I want a managing foreman.’ ‘l’m
leaving this job on Saturday,’ he said. ‘ For what reason?’
I asked. ‘ Well, my boss called me a liar this morning,
and I leave on Saturday. I’ll allow no man to call me a
liar.’ Thereupon I engaged that foreman, and he proved
a revelation. ‘ How did you make that business pay with
a3O per cent, reduction?’ I asked. ‘ Well, it was a re-
duction and an increase at the same time,’ he explained.
‘ For a reduction sale I generally tack on 40 per cent, and
take off 30. So you see our reduction sales show an in-
creased profit of 10 per cent., and a reduction to the
public of 30. You know people will walk miles out of
their way to get a reduction, and 30 is not too much to
give them—under the circumstances. It would never do
to give public reductions like that for more than a month.
No tradesman could afford it, you know. ‘ Then the 30
per cent, reduction is a lie ? ’ ‘ Well, if you will, it may
be a simple, harmless trade lie, but the public gets the
reduction, and the boss gets the increase, and both are
highly satisfied.’
“Bieduction sales on the same lines were frequent
thereafter in my business under the new foreman, and my
former 14 idle hands quickly developed into 28 dead-tired,
over-worked and weary employees.
“ The Pick-and-Shovel tavern adjoining my shop had a
fast-dying trade and a killing-whisky name. Patrons
were few and contemptuous. The complaint was that
proprietor Bung only kept one whisky, and that was too
new and too cheap, and he had no invalid port. I bought
Bung’s lease, and installed my foreman as manager.
Three days later I was confronted with two bills ; viz,,
one hogshead of whisky' (in bond), no brand, at 4s. per
gal., and one hogshead of invalid port at 3s. per gal.
‘ Good God,’ I said, ‘ why didn’t you get a variety of
whiskies instead of a whole hogshead of one brand?’ ‘I
have a variety,’ he said, ‘ all in one cask. ‘ Invalid port
at 3s. per gal.,’ I murmured. ‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘the
town will be full of invalids shortly.’
“Next day there glared in the windows of the Pick-
and-Shovel large posters bearing the words: ‘ Under
New Management, Six Brands of Bare Bulk Whisky, 10
to 15 years old. Invalid Port, The finest Made, 20 years
old, 10s. per bottle.’ ‘ It’s the age that makes it so dear,’
said the foreman to inquiring invalids.
“The 20-year-old port, the six brands of rare bulk
whisky (from one cask), and the new management of the
Pick-and-Shovel soon told their tale. The fame of the
new manager, who would allow no one to call him a liar,
spread to the adjoining villages, and confidence in the
liquor at the Pick-and-Shovel was restored.
“Many a time a few buckets of water, with a
bottle of angostura added, poured into a freshly-emptied
beer barrel, did duty for light English at the Pick-and-
Shovel. ‘ That’s a very light ale,’ said a customer one
da.y. ‘ I feels it in me stomach, but not in me ’ead.’
‘ Yes,’ says the managing foreman; ‘they can’t make it
so beautifully light in Australia.’
“An unlucky day came. I lost that foreman. In a
hasty moment I called him a liar. ‘ I’ll allow no man tc
call me a liar,’ he said, and left.”
THE BELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No superstitious fear have I
For goblins, ghosts, nor anything
That is not present to the eye ;
Yet when I hear a doorbell ring,
To a weird pitch my mind is wrought,
And gets involved in tangled thought.
A royal span my life, 1 know ;
Not many pleasures I have missed,
But pleasures come and pleasures go ;
And lovers, shipwrecked at the tryst,
Drift with the sea of wine that flows
Round the red beacon of the nose.
And so it came that on a day,
Still in the sea of wine immersed,
My cash and credit sailed away,
And clouds grew black and bubbles burst;
Then I awoke to feel the sting,
And hear the blessed doorbell ring.
Not any ruse appeared to stale
The infinite variety
Of characters in this true tale,
That used to ring the bell for me,
Till neighbors, gossiping, would grin
And say, “ Is that man ever in ? ”
I used to sit behind the blind,
The while they gathered round the door
And mentioned me in terms unkind,
Comparing each the lengthy score ;
And very heavy grew the load
Of monumental sums I owed.
The Fates are kind to whom they love —
To resurrect them from despair
They send along the fabled dove
With leaves and holly in its hair ;
And half my troubles went like smoke
The day the blessed bell wire broke !
Yet, though to my philosophy
No graveyard spectres gain access,
And though I clothe in mystery
The theologic wilderness,
Accusing spooks drab dirges sing
Whene’er I hear a door-bell ring 1

The only Horizontal Grand Piano in tHe World witH Solid Iron Wrest-Plank,
and wHicH will REMAIN at full Philharmonic, or any other PitcH.
Every Beale Piano, horizontal or upright, has a solid iron wrest-plate.
Every imported piano, whether horizontal or upright, has a wooden wrest-plank.
The advantages of the iron wrest-plate over the wooden wrest-plank are enormous.
In a horizontal Grand there are two hundred and forty wrest-pins, each a quarter of an inch in diameter. In an imported piano
they are all driven tightly into a wooden plank. The strings are then attached, and they are wrested round with a key, so
as to draw the strings tight.
When the strings are in tune, the total strain on these two hundred and forty pins amounts to thirty tons. Each pin is acting
like a lever on the unfortunate wooden plank.
The wooden plank cannot stand such a strain, and it lets the pins turn backwards by the pull of the strings.
The piano is then out of tune.
The tuner comes again and turns those pins backwards and forwards some more. They get looser every time he touches them.
In a few years the piano cannot hold the proper pitch, especially if it has been used for concert work, for pianos with wooden
wrest-planks have to be re-tuned before each concert.
But the Beale Pianos have a solid iron wrest-plate, in which the pins are entirely contained. By a simple tension-screw they can
be regulated to withstand any wresting strain, and, of course a direct pull has no effect on them at all.
Therefore we guarantee our pianos for twenty-five years. They require tuning only at very long intervals, and any way no amount
of tuning would injure the pins or the wrest-plate.
Further particulars with our free catalogue. We shall be pleased if you will call or write us.

, The Royal Agricultural Show (Sydney) is in
luck this year. Easter arrives late, so the congregation
of wool and whiskers from the uttermost ends of the State
will not commence till April 14. Which means that the
full benefit of the recent golden rains will have been ex-

HEADACHES.
One of the chief causes of headaches is the
circulation of poisons in the blood. Poisons are
constantly being formed in the body in the diges-
tion and absorption of food, but they produce no
ill effects unless formed in excess. In indigestion
the formation of these poisons takes place at an
enormous rate ; they pass through the system in
the circulating blood, and produce high blood
pressure and a sense of general ill-health, irrita-
bility of temper, and headache, which only the
sufferer can realise the extent of. To overcome
headaches it is absolutely necessary to get at the
cause. Drugs which act on the heart and reduce
the pulsations only have a temporary effect. If
you suffer from indigestion, biliousness, constipa-
tion, any disorder of the liver and kidneys, or
from any weakness peculiar to your sex, there is
no better remedy than Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills.
Mrs Johnson, of 397 Pyrmont Street, Pyrmont,
Sydney, states :—“I wish to add my testimony to
the valuable properties of your pills. I have
always found them a most efficacious remedy for
headaches and dizziness, and a most valuable
medicine for married women. I am convinced if
your pills were more universally adopted as a
family medicine there would be far less suffering.
I always recommend them, and use no other
medicine in my family.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Though there was much excuse for the English
failuie to score in the first innings of the Fourth Test,
there was none for the Australians’ exhibition for 214.
They started on a wicket all in their favor, but, excepting
Noble and Ransford, none of them were comfortable with
Fielder’s length and Crawford’s “ fatal fluency.” As usual
the “ champagne ” personage succumbed for the round
figure in Fielder’s second over. Hill, following, knocked
up seven as if in pain, and then fell to Barnes, who had
leg theory on exhibition. Barnes’s field had eight
men on the on-side —five in the vicinity of silly leg
—while the off-field consisted of one at mid-off
and another with a roving commission between
point and third slip. This keeps runs down and spoils
the spectacle. Noble was bowled by Crawford for 48,
made by clean cutting. McAlister’s 37 was the most
confident exhibition. Syd Gregory’s 10 were made
mostly with his favorite glance, and when he crawled
pavilionwards after being taken by Fielder at point, the
record was 5-10-105. Then Armstrong and little Rans-
ford collaborated and lifted the figures to 196, when Rans-
ford, caught in the slips by Braund, retired for 51. The
cataclysm came with the total for 214, Armstrong being
37.
Heavy rain on Saturday prevented play till
2.20, when Hobbs (9) and Gunn (0), the not-out English-
men, appeared, and Gunn took strike to Macartney.
The wicket was drying rapidly, and was all
in the bowlers’ favor, but Gunn and Hobbs
(mostly Hobbs) took the score to 58, when Gunn
went to Saunders. After Gunn came the deluge,
Hardstaff, Hobbs, Hutchings and Braund vanishing in
quick succession. Hobbs fell to Noble’s first ball for the
day, having compiled 57. Saunders, bowling with “devil”
all day on such a wicket, took five for 28, while Noble’s
bag was three for 11. The score had changed from three
for 88 to all out for 105—a bowlers’ day with a vengeance.
The Englishmen were dismissed at 4.40 p.m. That left
an hour’s play, which made the' names of the pride and
chivalry of Australian cricket as Mud on that beastly
wicket. Noble was getting a dose of his own poison. He
lost three for 49, champagne Victor adding another
open gem to his necklace. Noble, with a great effort,
contributed 10, McAlister only four, and Gregory and
Hill (the not-out men) were 13 and 18 respectively at the
drawing of the stumps.
After drying nicely all Sunday, the wicket had
lost its deadliness on Monday when Hill took strike to
Barnes. Demoniac fielding caused Hill to be run out for
25, and Gregory got bis leg in front when 29. Then Arm-
strong came out like Horatius at the Bridge, and Barnes
gave him a special reception by abandoning the off-
theory, bowling round the wicket with all his men but
one on the on side. When Ransford joined Armstrong
five wickets had fallen for 78 runs, and Armstrong
appeared to be tied in a knot. He played a heavy, ele-
phantine, defensive game, and scored 14 in the hour,
while Ransford' knocked up 21 in 40 minutes.
After lunch Fielder and Barnes resumed, and for a time
what run-getting was done was by Ransford. But Rans-
ford’s luck changed when he< broke his bat at 50,
and after adding four more he was caught behind the
wicket by Rhodes. The combination had yielded 85, and
they all counted. Macartney joined Armstrong, and was
caught for 29. Armstrong just floundered on, but he was
making runs all the time, and when Carter scored 17 off
one over, the English fortunes began to look blue. Then
Armstrong seemed to get set. and began to bash things
in style—although he had bashed them just as severely
before in a lumbering way. It was not what he was
doing, but the way he was doing it. O’Connor came
along, and Armstrong sailed into the century, and at the
drawing of the stumps Armstrong had reached 114 and
O’Connor 12, the total being eight wickets for 359. On
Tuesday O’Connor added six, then Humphries caught
him off Barnes. The partnership had added 45 runs.
With the appearance of Saunders the end was in view,
and Armstrong lost runs to keep the strike. Saunders
created excitement by making a pair of singles—then
Jones caught him off Fielder, and the innings closed for
385, Armstrong carrying his bat for 133. With 495 re-
quired to win the Englishmen went to the wickets in a
state of despair, and a rot set in from the very start.
They never made the ghost of a stand, and at about 5.30
their innings closed for 186. Australia had won the
winning match of the rubber by 308. Still it must be said
for the beaten side that the elements fought against it.
+ * * *
With aTest match raging in Melbourne —a match,
moreover, that might settle the rubber and decide the
destination of the Ashes—but languid interest was taken
in the local First Grade competitions in Sydney on Satur-
day last. The perspiring batsmen paused in the middle
of the runs to catch news of the latest score, and then
made objurgations as they resumed the business of run-
getting. Cotter came out to see what he was like after
his recent injury, but apparently was very unlike, for he
took only one wicket for 105 runs. This compared badly
with the record of Colin Campbell, the Glebe Third Grade
trundler, who at Birchgrove took 10 Balmain wickets for
16 runs, and won the match on his own. Cotter is
evidently still suffering from the effects of that strain.
Altogether, bowlers had a fair day, the only crowd to slog
the leather at all being the Redfern men, who banged it to
the melody of 396 for six wickets. Whitting, of Balmain,
topped the list with five of Waverley for 34, and next to
him was Johnson, of North Sydney, who knocked down
five Sydney wickets for 48, while Sullivan, of Balmain,
took the other five Waverley sticks for 56. Among the
ba'tsmen, Austin Diamond was easily first, with 113 of
Burwood’s total score of 211. Barnes, of Redfern, made
a bigger score, 124 of the total score of 396, but Diamond’s
innings was a spectacular affair as well as a great cricket-
ing feat. These two were the only century makers,
though Single, of Central Cumberland, gave a good dis-
play, and carried out his waddy for 76.

Playing for Waratah v. East Newcastle on
Saturday, cricketer Arnott perpetrated a slashing innings
of 239 not out in a total of 328 runs for eight wickets.
The smasher hit twelve fives during the course of his
merry mood. The next highest scorer on the side had
but 19 opposite his name. The Arnotts, of Newcastle, are
fine sportsmen—Sam Arnott being George Towns’ chief
backer and adviser in his onslaught on the sculling
championship. « * •
The old hands continue to creep back into the
top niches of cricket. The S. Australian team to play
the dusky warriors from Fiji at Adelaide, on February 21,
and 22, includes George Giffen and J. J. Lyons—a couple
belonging to the very long ago. Harry Trott and Frank
Laver were in the Vic. team the other day ; Syd Gregory
is in the Test match ; and Charlie Turner is still a factor
to be reckoned with in Sydney junior cricket. Mean-
while there are hundreds of young players on the doorstep
looking out for a chance to shine.

“ The Swimmer ” : The sadness of a sad planet
is added to when The Bulletin opens its columns to the
cricket crank, and “ Arsemo,” with his suggestion that
every cricket partnership should produce runs at the rate
of 50 per dozen overs, shows himself a cricket crank of
the worst description. The objections to a rule for making
a batsman score a certain number of runs in a specified
time apply to “ Araemo’s ” idea with even greater force,
and it has several objections of its own in addition. How
are you going to find out who is the slower batsman if
the runs are not scored in the time ? The umpires, who
already have enough to do, would have to keep a tally
of the number of strikes each man had, then stop
the game when the twelve overs were up, while they did
a sum on the pitch with a piece of chalk. This would
have to be worked out in vulgar fractions or decimals,
probably taking half-an-hour, and it wouldn’t settle the
point then. One man might score ten less than his part-
ner who had had (say) ten more balls than him to strike
at. ' If the umpire gave him out as the slower scorer, he
would furiously point out to that official that if he had
got those ten dashed balls he would have scored at least
five dashed fours off them, instead of pottering about like
a dashed old woman. Then, again, the striking
batsman would refuse to run single early in
the over so as not to lose the strike. And as few
partnerships start with the beginning of an over
there would be disputes as to when the twelve overs were
really up. Also, what about the partnerships that don’t
run into a dozen overs? Give another cricket crank a
chance to make a suggestion. Limit all first-class matches
to four days, a day for each innings. Make each side
close its innings at 6 o’clock each day, no matter how
many wickets it had to fall. This would bring about an
increased rate of scoring very quickly, and would liven up
the game all round, because the fielding side would try
to get the other fellows out under the day in order to get
the benefit of the increased batting time. And four days
is enough time to spend on any game in the world.
There has been some freak cricket in Maoriland
lately. On a recent Saturday the Masterton men went
to the wickets against Carterton, and were all disposed of
in a few minutes for six runs. One man scored four (not
out), and it makes Masterton mad to think he might have
made 250 if he could have found a man to keep up the
other wicket ; two byes were run, and 10 men made
ducks. At one period of this innings eight wickets were
down for one bye ! The bowline averages were stagger-
ing Gallon six for one, and Ticehurst four for three.
A "fortnight later the teams met again, when Moss, for
Masterton, took 10 Carterton wickets for 10 runs. All the
runs were knocked up before he got a wicket, the last
nine wickets falling without a score.

Judging by present appearances, the current
international cricket campaign is going to result in
benefit to the Marylebone Cricket Club, and to no one
else. Up to date Major Trevor has received £6OOO, and
the other £4OOO remains to be made up. This means that
unless an enormous attendance happens along to the
remaining fixtures the Australian Associations are going
to get practically nothing out of the visit, and will pro-
bably have to put their hands in their pockets for part
of the expenses. #
The Marylebone Club’s idea of a triangular
cricket duel among England, South Africa and Australia
is being resolutely kicked by “prominent persons con-
nected with cricket ” who don’t want their names pub-
lished. Safe to bet that the p.p.c.c. are players who
look with horror upon anything that will tend
to reduce the number of trips to Britain.
When international games are played in Australia the
players get £25 per match and exes., and the Board of
Control divides the profits (when there are any) among
the various associations. From a purely cricketing point
of view the proposed triangular struggle will be very
beneficial and enormously increase public interest in the
jr ame —especially if some method of shortening the Tests
can be discovered.

The list of surf-bathing casualties around Syd-
ney has fallen off of late, the holocaust of a few weeks ago
having convinced a lot of fools—who were daring only
because they hadn’t the machinery with which to think—
that it was best to keep close to the crowd. But on
Sunday last, at Cronulla Beach, one cheerful idiot care-
fully ferreted out the most dangerous spot and plunged
in. Hardly was he in than he yelled for help, and his
brother, who went to his aid, was soon beside him in the
soup. Then three others came along with the life-line,
and when they were all hauled out it took quite a time
to bring the brother and one of the other rescuers round.
It is not reported that anybody soundly kicked the cause
of the trouble. An official kicker is badly required round
Sydney beaches just now.
* * * »
The Royal Life Saving Society has invited the
various surf-bathing clubs to send along delegates to a
conference at the N.S.W. Sports Club, Sydney, to discuss
the best methods of saving life on ocean beaches. The
members of these surf-bathing clubs have had a fearful
lot of experience of late, and the society has determined
to collect all the information available, and, if possible,
deduce from it a special code of instructions applicable
to surf-bathing. Of late it has begun to be whispered
about that some of the worst cases of drowning or partial
drowning have occurred through the too vigorous hand-
ling of the life-line by eager but inexperienced haulers.

The swimming championships of Australia
were contested at Fremantle (W.A.) on Saturday last
under lumpy circumstances. The continual bumping
against hard*slabs of water made fast travelling impossi-
ble, so no records were broken that day. The half-mile
fell to Victoria, boy Beaurepaire winning from Dickman
and Garland, of N.S.W., in that order. The other starters
were Springfield, of Queensland, and Sweetman, of
Westralia. Beaurepaire gained 6yds. in the first lap
105yds.), and showed that he had much previous experi-
ence of scrambling over watery boulders. Springfield,
the holder of the half-mile championship, showed
skill in the same direction, but, unfortunately for himself,
could not swim fast enough. At the half-distance Beaure-
paire was leading by 30yds., and during the second half
he doubled the distance. He won easily from Dickman,
and Dickman won so easily from Garland that he had
40yds. to spare.
Cecil Healy came out for the 220yds. So did
Garland. Beaurepaire again represented Victoria ;
Springfield appeared for Queensland ; Bennet and Sweet-
man for Westralia. From the start it was apparent that
the only one who had a possible against the streaking
Cecil was Beaurepaire, and his chance was only equal to
that of Moses when the light had blown out. Cecil held
him easily from start to finish, and crawled away from
every desperate spurt made by the struggling Victorian,
beating him by 10yds. Springfield was the same distance
behind Beaurepaire.

Billy Mason, the lean Melbourne Swimming
Club crack, annexed the 220yds. championship of Victoria,
at the Abbotsford freshwater baths, down Collingwood
way, last Saturday. Six competitors lined up for the
struggle, but they had no chance against the wiry Willie,
who shoved both hands in front after the first lap—soyds.
He crawled all over the Vic. record. It cannot be stated
he crawled all the way, but his paddle was sufficient to
win by half the bath from Nicholson, of Brighton. Claring-
bold was all out third, and consequently had to be restored
with a whiff of Abbotsford beer or something. The official
watches said 2min. 44 3-ssec., which knocks chips off
Frank Fitts’ 2min. 52 3-ssec., made last season. The
standard time—2min. 50sec.—also got a decided bump.
This season the Cabbage Stater has shown improvement
at every distance, but, despite the introduction of the
crawl, nothing hereabouts has equalled single over-armist
Arthur Kenney’s 61 l-ssec. for a straight hundred, which
he accomplished abroad. Though out of the game for
many years, Arthur still retains some of his old dash.

Small wonder the Auckland bowlers beat the
N.S.W. Metropolitan crowd. The difference between the
players was appalling. The visitors(and the same applies
to the Victorians who visit Sydney from time to time) were
spick and span, all in spotless white, wearing their
club colors, and playing the game as though their
lives depended on it. The M.L. rink skippers con-
ferred often and anxiously as to what was to be done,
and as any two heads are usually better than one, the
result was something good. The Walers, on the other
hand, were a nondescript-looking crowd, charmingly
casual—too casual to be efficient. One man at the Test
match wore white pants, a yellow vest, striped coat,
brown hat, and black boots. Another ruffian wore
black trousers, a green vest, white coat and yellow
hat, and when he wasn’t actually trundling the
biassed globe he was right away from the scene of play
with his back turned on the game telling a yarn about a
dog. In fact, the Walers generally were cogged out like
Aunt Sallies from ole-clo’ shops. And the difference in
their appearance was just the difference in their play.
Too beastly casual to dress properly for a Test match,
they had been also too beastly casual to practise and train
for it.
The well-known Sydney sporting writer, W. F.
Corbett, was recently tendered a banquet and other
pleasant things at the Sports Club, Sydney. A big
crowd of representative men drank his health and said
so many nice things about him that big, bluff William
actually blushed, and was temporarily deprived of the
power of making a joke. +
The big-game hunter stands apart among men.
Once a man has caught the desire of big game he Will face
any risks to accumulate a bag. When the French were
conquering Madagascar it was well known that many big-
game hunters came over from Africa, and joined the
Hovas. There is excitement in stalking a lion or shoot-
ing down a charging elephant, but for reai bliss nothing
comes up to stalking a soldier who can shoot back. So
the big-game hunters, who didn’t care a scrap about the
Hova cause, became the backbone of the Hova resistance.
Had there been 10,000 of him a Hova monarch would
probably reign in Antananarivo to-day. The so-called
anarchist is often merely a big-game hunter who hasn t
the means to satisfy his inclinations among the lions of
Africa, the grizzlies of the Rockies, or the tigers of India.
So whqn the desire to make a bag gets him down he goes
out and'bags tl>e biggest man about the pla.ce. Lately,
the big-game hunters had a field day—in Lisbon, of all
places—and secured a king and a crown prince. The re-
port that thev had bagged a Czar the same week, fortu-
nately for the Czar, turned out to be a canard. Curious
to watch the man who has the big-game instinct m his
blood smacking his lips while he denounces these “ brutal
murders ” in the tram-car.

N.S.W. Rugby Union has got a move on
attained velocity, in fact—and is arranging to ravage the
British Isles with one XV. which will play 28 matches in
England, as well as tests in England, Scotland, Ireland
and Wales. It will also play a game or two in France,
and try conclusions with the Canadians and Yankees on
the homeward journey. Another XV. will meet a Maori-
land team that will call in on its way to England, while
there is talk of letting a third XV. loose in Maonland
itself.

The Maoriland League footballers did not make
the clean sweep of the English Northern Union clubs that
the All Blacks did of the amateur Rugby crowd. Still they
did very well, and at time of writing had won 16 matches,
lost 14 and drawn two. At Chelsea, on Saturday, they
smashed up the Northern Union representative team by 18
points to six. The cables describe the match as the best
display of the tour. The tour ends with a match at
Cheltenham this Saturday.

Messrs. Giltinan and Hoyle, of the N.S.W.
Rugby League, journeyed to Newcastle last week, and
held out golden visions to the young men of the district
—if thev would join a League club. There was gold in
the pockets of the people, and silver at the gate, and they
could get it—by playing under the auspices of the
League. And the Newcastle Rugbyites listened atten-
tively, passed a vote of thanks for the visit and the
address, and then decided by a majority that they would
not form a League club at present. The organisers had
better luck at North Sydney, where, with a lot less per-
suasive eloquence, they succeeded in forming a really
strong club. By the way, the first sign of departing
summer in the shape of football club meetings has come
early this year, and quite a number of clubs are getting
out balance-sheets, and so forth. Both League and Union
will be in the field early.

Latest news from Wanganui is that Tresidder
is hard at work trying to get rid of weight—he finds the
M.L. climate very fattening—while Webb is struggling
just as hard to put some on. Webb recently chucked
training fqr a whole week and, going up the river in a
canoe, had a seven days’ picnic. Experts (they swarm in
Wanganui just now) pronounced him much benefited by
the trip. Tresidder is said to be better than ever in his
life before, but then writer does not remember a case in
which a man in a similar position was not; while Webb is
said to be able to propel the shell twice as fast as on
any previous occasion. Which also has a familiar
sound about it, and reminds one of the news that the
sporting reporter wrote of John L. Sullivan before he met
his Cannae with Corbett. On that occasion, the young
penman finished off a hair-raising description of the awful
fighter with a paragraph to the effect that his hands were
so hard they dented the table whenever he happened to
let them fail on it, and so heavy owing to the increase of
hard muscle that he could hardly hold them up. But, in
the case of Webb and Tresidder, it really does sound as
though this match were going to produce something special
in the way of fast travelling. Although so far away from
populous centres, fancy prices are to be charged for
points of vantage where people can watch the race, and
already orders are pouring in for tickets on the official
boats at £2 and £1 apiece.

The hydroplane speed creeps slowly upward,
and the French record of 44-odd miles per hour has been
utterly smashed by the Italians, some of whose'planes have
attained a speed of 50 miles per hour. The latest models
lie, when stationary, just on the surface of the water
with the hydroplanes completely submerged on either
side. When a speed of 20 miles has been attained the
hull begins to lift. At 30 miles it is completely out of
the water, and the whole structure is travelling on the
side planes which skim along the surface. Rigidity of
hull is the chief requisite of a successful hydroplane,
and they are dangerous things ; the slightest suggestion
of broken water brings about a capsize and general smash.
When travelling at 50 miles an hour, it is a serious matter
to fall overboard—at that speed the water has become
about as hard as ordinary earth, and the man who strikes
it breaks bones and suffers from surf rash. Santos
Dumont, the Brazilian absentee who lives in Paris, has
just completed the machine in which he will either break
all previous records, by travelling at 60 miles an hour, or
forfeit£2ooo. Santos will probably lose his money.

N.S.W. Baseball Association has organised the
game in Sydney on a district basis. Eleven first-grade
clubs have been created, while the second grade will
contain nine. The districts are roughly those into which
the cricketers are drafted, and bear the following names :
Burwood, Leichhardt, Lane Cove, Middle Harbor, North
Sydney, Paddington, Petersham, Randwick, Redfern,
University and Waverley. Baseball is healthy just now,
but the abnormal increase in the popularity of bowls is
sure to have a detrimental effect. All the footballers are
turning to bowls for the hot weather. In Sydney, it must
be remembered, they play bowls all the year round ex-
cepting the few weeks in September or October when the
greens"are getting a new top dressing, so if this rush of
bowls recruits continues all games will suffer.

Club-manipulator Tom Burrows will have to put
extra pins in his laurel crown. At Jewhannesburg
(S’Africa) t’other day, a lady named Seddon reached for
the leaves by swinging timber for 45 consecutive hours.
She was the champion lady wood-whirler of creation up
to November last, when another lady named Vernon
transpired and whirled her into oblivion. The above
whirl was a successful attempt to regain the glory. The
one redeeming feature about this deadly foolishness is that
the training will probably raise a muscle that will come
in handy for baby-carrying later on.
* * * *
“S.S.”: Have seen Burrows at his record-
breaking club swinging. He waded in to brandish his
weapons for 60 hours, and had been at it for about
30 when I saw him. This is a tremendous feat of
endurance, but, as a spectacle, it is not even as emotional
as tbe show of the expert who undertook to stand on his
head for a whole day. One can conceive of a situation in
which it might be of advantage to a man to stand on his
head for 24 hours—he might be suffering from swelled
feet, for instance —but I cannot track down a set of cir-
cumstances in which it would avail a victim anything to
be able to swing two clubs for 2£ days. After watching
Burrows for an hour you are sorry for him, after another
half hour you are sorry for yourself. It is a dizzying sight,
and it strikes me that vivisectionists and members of
societies for the prevention of cruelty to camels would
be better employed in suppressing this sort of self-
inflicted torture.
The Ormond-Daytona Beach (U.S.A.) motor
carnival commences on March 2, and promises to produce
results that will stagger humanity, especially if humanity
gets in front of the flying cars. Hitherto these races
have been controlled by the local Florida East Coast
Automobile Association, which had not the money to run
a world meeting. Recognising the wisdom of having the
famous beach properly prepared, the Florida E.C.A. has
handed over the management and control of both meet-
ing and beach to the big Automobile Club of America—a
most wealthy concern. The first result was an enormous
improvement in the track. A 16-mile straightaway course
was made, and looped with banked tracks made of 2in.
planking, properly graded for turning. These loops bring
the competitors back on to the wet sand, and make a lap
of 32 miles, on which some startling times are expected
to be made. Among the races to be held are a 228-mile
contest for the American Club’s Cup, 100 miles Inter-
national Championship, One Mile International Record,
Two-Miles-per-Minute Race, and a number of shorter
distance championships, which practically amount to
jumping contests, for the car that bounds off the mark
most suddenly will win. The Yankee builders have
gone to enormous expense to retrieve their reputa-
tion, as at present the Yankee cars cannot hold
their own against those made in Europe. U.S. makers
have been devoting themselves largely to the steam
car, and are said to have brought it to a state of almost
noiseless perfection. The petrol-driven car received a
heavy blow in the Uncle Sam country, through some
hundreds of cities forbidding the use of petrol, benzine,
and other fluid smells within the municipal boundaries.
This has reallv been part of the universal rebellion
against the Sta'ndard Oil Trust, and has compelled makers
to evolve a carburetter to vaporise alcohol. Up to the
present the 90-mile-an-hour alcohol car has not been
evolved ; but it is coming, sure as fate. It leaves no
smell behind, and is beloved of the people.

Geo. Horder, the crack Sydney pedal-pusher,
met ginger Geo. Farley in a three-distance match at the
saucer track (Melb.), on Saturday night last. The whirl,
paced by a tandem, provided some interest, for in the
second test over a half-mile, Horder came a cropper. In
the steep end, after leaving the straight, Horder, on the
outside, bored his opponent, struck, and bounced up the
bank on all parts of his anatomy, but eventually sought
the level with a roll. Farley finished on his lonesome, a
fair winner by circumstance. Writer sat on the saucer
edge immediately over the fall spot, and reckons Horder
entirely the cause. The officials, however, declared it no
race (they reserve that right in the event of punctures,
falls, breakages, etc.). As Horder was neither
broken nor dead, he turned up later for a second
go. Farley had the tandem wheel, but on the
pace quitting, a couple of laps from home, Horder
put on a spurt and won after a hot scorch in 61sec. Prior
to the buster, Horder won the first test—a mile—all the
way, crossing the line half a length to the good in 2min.
6 l-ssec. The third test was quite unnecessary, as
Horder won best two of three ; and, in any case, on
form it was a foregone conclusion.

“B.B.”: The Australasian championship ath-
letic gathering will-eventuate at Hobart on February 29
and March 2, and promises to be the keenest fight for
many years, as Tasmania, Maoriland, Queensland, Vic-
toria, and N.S.W. will be represented. The meanness of
the N.S.W. Amateur Athletic Association is likely to come
home to roost, however. That body will depend on Nigel
Barker (who isn’t a sound athlete) to pull it out of the
soup in a wide range of events —100yds., 220yds., 440yds.,
880yds., 440yds. hurdles, and running broad jump. It is
too much to expect one man to keep the State tail aloft
in all these directions when opposed to the pick of Aus-
tralasian athletes.

A shindykit has been formed at Wellington
(N.S.W.) to gather together a team of buckjumpers to
tour the world. As a sideshow, perhaps, there wouldn’t
be a finer entertainment; and it would be worth a round
sum to see the English Johnnie with his eye-glass make
an effort to sit on Bobs, even for a fragment of a second.
The syndicate gives the information that the team will be
thoroughly representative of Australia’s horse outlawdom.

Commonwealth’s top-notch hurdler, Regret,
who won Raunceston Cup, with Bst. 71b. up, on Wednes-
day last week, only arrived from Melbourne the previous
day. Victoria’s crack hurdle rider (Burn) was in the
saddle. Regret’s best achievement over “country’’was
the winning of Doutta Galla Hurdles (carrying 12st. 31b.),
when he beat eight others pointless. What a feather
Bst. 71b. must have been to the crack lepper is shown by
the fact that not long since, with the ballast of 12st., he
appropriated a Jumpers’ Flat race (ljm.) at Aspendale
Park in 2min. llfsec. Rhesus, Sheet Anchor, and Dura-
tion (jumpers of the past) won Launceston Cups in their
day and generation.

Suffered Torments with Skin Disease
Contracted in India—Was Covered
with Large Sores—Life in India
Affected Liver—Found No Relief
in Several Hospitals but
CUTICURA REMEDIES
BROUGHT HIM HEALTH
"While I was stationed at Bellary,
in India, with my regiment from 1896
to 1901, I contracted "malarial ca-
chexia,” which brought on a compli-
cation of diseases. I suffered frequently
with ague and my chest and back be-
came covered with large sores and pim-
ples, my face was also disfigured with
these sores or ulcers. My blood be-
came very poor. I was admitted into
hospital, but the treatment I received
did not seem to give me any relief, as
I became very emaciated and weak.
I lost my appetite, had no energy for
anything, and my weakness was dreadful.
Early in 1901 I was invalided to Eng-
land for a change. On arrival I was
sent to several hospitals, but still no
signs of recovery. After some months of
treatment I was finally invalided out of
the service as medically unfit through
my sickness.
I then thought I would try the Cuti-
cura Remedies, chiefly on the recom-
mendation of my wife, who had great
faith in them, having used the same
in India for roughness of the face, red
pimples, and blackheads. After I had
used four sets, which included Cuti-
cura Soap, Cuticura Ointment, and
Cuticura Resolvent Pills, I began to
see and feel a great improvement, I
was less languid, my appetite improved,
I felt stronger, and the sores and pimples
began to disappear. I continued to
usethe'treatment for about nine months.
Finally I was quite a different man, I
lost the yellow tinge my skin had, the
sores and pimples quite disappeared,
and I became strong again and able to
§o to business daily, which I have
one ever since. I thoroughly recom-
mend Cuticura Remedies for humours

WORKS A WONDERFUL CHANGE.
(BY A SPECIAL REPORTER.)
So many go on suffering year by year through
lack of serviceable information, it is deemed ad-
visable to place before the public the story of Mrs.
Mary Janeßudd, of 38 Young-street, Redfern, so
that a salutary lesson may be learned. What
Mrs. Budd said to our special was this :
“It is now eight years since my husband died,
a calamity that took place when we had been
living in this house nine years, so you see I have
been residing here a good while.”
“ Yes,” assented the reporter. “ I believe you
are an old resident of these parts ? ”
“I was born in Bourke-street, and have lived in
this locality all my life. But, to go back to my
story. It was not long after my great bereavement
that I became a total wreck. The blow nearly
killed me, and for a good while I was really
Btupefied with grief. For some considerable time
my memory was completely lost, and it was im-
possible for me to concentrate my mind for a few
minutes upon any subject. When my dazed con-
dition passed away it was then that I realised how
terribly my whole system had suffered, a fact
which dawned upon me as I stood at the table one
day feeling so ill that I did not think I would live
till the morrow. For my own part, I did not care
what happened, but I thought of my three little
children, and said to myself: ‘What ever can I
take to do me good for their sakes ? ’ ”
“Was that the first time you thought of taking
anything ? ”
“ It was the first time I thought of acting on
my own judgment, the reason being that I was
under a doctor for some length of time, and his
treatment hadn’t benefited me in the least.”
“What did your medical attendant say was
wrong with you ? ”
“He told me I had taken my afflictions in-
wardly, and that my nervous system was in a very
weak state. I knew that well enough, unfortu-
nately, for I could not even bear to hear the
children talking, their voices got on my nerves so,
and if a tap came to the door I nearly fainted with
fright. I hadn’t the least desire for food, and I
think one of my greatest afflictions was my in-
ability to get to sleep. For four years I did not
know what it was to sleep properly for one night.
It was usual for me to remain awake till about 3
or 4 o’clock in the morning, and then dose off till
half-past 5, when I always awoke with a start, and
would get no more sleep till next morning. And
the dreams I had each time I slept—they were
awful.”
“You must have lost weight during your
illness?”
“Oh ! I was ghastly. My bones were almost
protruding through my skin, and anybody seeing
me could not have thought otherwise than that I
would never get better again. I really thought 1
was doomed to die, and feel sure I would have
been dead long ago ONLY FOR CLEMENTS
TONIC, WHICH WAS THE LAST MEDI-
CINE OF ALL THAT I TOOK. A friend often
used to say, ‘ Why don’t you try some Clements
Tonic ?’ but I always postponed doing so ; but at
last I thought that as I had heard so much about
it, and nothing else could dome any good, I would
give Clements Tonic a trial. This was the decision
that I came to the day that I stood at the table
feeling that I could not last another twenty-four
hours, so what better reason than that could I have
for saying that Clements Tonic saved my life?
You must understand that I was quite incapable
of doing any work, and that it was a common thing
for me to be in bed a fortnight at a time, utterly
unable to attend to anything that required seeing
to, so when Clements Tonic began to put a little
life and strength into me you can imagine how
thankful I was for it. And weren’t the neighbors-
surprised to hear that I had taken a turn for the
better ? My word, it was a matter that astonished
nearly the whole of Redfern. But what a relief
it was to have my headaches ease off after suffer-
ing so long with them ! And wasn't I glad to feel
that Clements Tonic was also doing good to my
nervous system ? Why, I had only been taking
that remedy a few weeks when I could stand noise®
of any kind without wincing, and already I was
getting more sleep than I had had for years.”
“Did you feel more refreshed after it than
formerly ?’’
“Oh ! yes; much. The reason why, I suppose,
was that I did not dream at all, so both my brain
and body were resting all the time, and when I
awoke 1 felt so fresh and lighthearted—no nasty
taste in the mouth as before, a clean tongue, and,
my word, what an appetite for breakfast I had 5
Clements Tonic did make me eat and no mistake,
and my nerves were getting stronger and stronger
as the days went by. Eventually my old fears and
imaginations died right away, nothing more
troubling me, and all this wonderful change was
entirely due to Clements Tonic. Oh ! I have
thanked God thousands of times that I was guided
to take that remedy, and I am so anxious that'
other sufferers may regain hope by hearing of my
cure. But Clements Tonic served me well in other
ways. It put an end to the giddy feelings I used
to have, removed the swollen feeling from my
eyes and the suffocating sensations from my chest*
then, finally, built up my strength so perfectly
that everyone could see my health was thoroughly
regained.”
“ May I publish your remarks ? ”
‘ ‘ I gladly give you permission to publish them
in any way.”

This co. has a share capital of £lOO,OOO, and a debenture
debt of £23,500. For a good many years the latter debt
stood at £30,000, but it has been reduced lately ; and
the co., after paying the present div., will have £3500
cash in hand, some of which may go towards a further
reduction. During the great drought the co. got into a
bad way ; but things are different now. Figures for the
latter half of recent years follow :

The half-year’s increased cost is mainly due to dearer
locomotive power. The return just at present is pretty
substantial (for last year it was £6 4s. 3d. per cent, on
capital and reserves, or £9 Is. per cent, on capital alone);
but the line serves a district where drought looks in
pretty often, and settlement is slow. Twenty years ago
the July-Deeember revenue ran as a rule to over £15,000,
and, though the co. then carried £46,000 debenture
bonds, a 10 per cent. div. was paid. What a failure
N. S. Wales land settlement policies have been can pretty
well be summed up from the fact that 5 per cent, is the
best dividend the co. has paid for the past 10 years.

In insurance this isn’t an age of specialisation ; in-
stead the cos. that started out to insure the owner
against loss by fire are now also prepared to gamble
on storms, wrecks, accidents, burglaries, carbun-
cles, and defalcations. Consequently, a little special-
ising co. like this doesn’t get much forrarder;
competition increases quite as fast as, if not a
bit faster than, windows. Five years ago the co.’s
premiums were £2680; last year they were £2761.
Claims are fairly constant; the brick goes through the
window with more regularity than might be expected.
Last year 33 per cent, of the premiums paid the claims :
the balance was left for working expenses and profit; and
the profit was helped on by £421 of interest on .the
investments.

Of the reserves £4562 consists of Renewals and Repairs
Fund, and that apparently is a provision for deprecia-
tion. Latterly £BOO per half year has been passed to the
credit of that fund, out of which meter repairs and plant
renewals are paid for. The amount actually spent is
shown as written off ; and the balance —which isn’t either
true profit or true reserve—is supposed to represent the
accumulating wear and tear ; it is the gathering pro-
vision for the renewals and repairs that will probably
arrive with a rush presently. The fixed investment
(plant, meters, etc.) stand in at £54,254 ; so the £BOO pro-
vided means a shade under 3 p.c. a year. If £BOO ought
to be written off per half-year, or 3 p.c. p.a., then
the true profit last twelve months was £2655, or £62 less
than the dividends that were paid. The co. has no credi-
tors, except for a few trade debts ; on the other hand, all
its own resources are sunk in the business.

The co. has a pretty large scheme in hand—the purchase
of the Newport gasworks, which have hitherto supplied
the north end of Williamstown. Though it now puis up
its dividend to 10 per cent., the co. has been working
along what appear to be careful lines. It has steadily
written down its plant, mains, and other fixed invest-
ments, and meantime has charged up repairs and re-
newals to working account. Four years ago, plant and
mains were in at £23,152 ; they now stand at £23,180.
Meantime, however (partly, no doubt, through extensions
of services paid for out of this allowance for depreciation),
the revenue has moved up from £2554 to £3479. The co.
has no debts apart from consumers’ deposits (£165) and a
few small current accounts, while liquid assets will
amount to £5825 after paying the present dividend.

The co. which owns the Heskett-Moore direct
process for- making iron had its half-yearly meeting in
Melbourne a few days ago, and found itself up against a
hard, cold financial problem. It has £29,750 of capital,
and £9920 of premium capital; also it has £4409 of debts,
including “ directors’ advances.” As plant is still needed,
and more experiments and tests are called for, it had no
option but to issue 6 per cent, debentures at 20 per cent,
discount, which really means that it wants to raise
£20,000 at 7| per cent. By way of encouraging the public
it is announced that the directors have taken up con-
siderable debentures ; but that can be explained probably
by the fact that the directors have made advances, and
the debentures (at 7£ per cent.) are to pay the advances
off. It would be a fine thing for Australia if the co. could
do half the things it alleges ; but so far the co. hasn’t
seemed as anxious to give Australian iron-making a lift as it
is to sell its foreign rights and give iron-making elsewhere
a lift. Apropos the vast sums that have been mentioned in
connection with these foreign sales, it turns out that the
sale of the Canadian rights for £350,000 is contingent
upon the co. demonstrating that it can do the work at
l7£ per cent, less cost than it can be done by present
methods. And a process that can do something as re-
volutionary as that in iron and steel making is dirt cheap
at the money.

McLeod, formerly director of the Charters
Towers School of Mines, has put in good work at the
Brilliant Extended. His aerial tram, conveying ore from
mine to mill, saves sd. per ton, he reckons ; and it very
likely does all that. At the engine-house he has
installed a very efficient condenser, which has cut down
the fuel bill. All over the place you come on to little
economies. In one of the main drives there is an endless-
rope installation, worked by a little compressed-air
engine underground; this cuts down costs of hauling
from the small underlay to the main shaft. At the
reduction works they still stick to Huntingdon mills,
and get better results from them than is usual on hard
quartz ores. But, in spite of all, the ore isn’t good
enough to let the Extended get far ahead of expenses.

BILIOUSNESS.
If you recognise that the Liver is the sewage
farm of the body, you will see the
importance of its free action.
The blood is easily poisoned by morbid pro-
ducts formed within the body, and
delayed in excretion.
A lazy liver is responsible for constipation,
the greatest disease —breeding disorder
of the body.
The retention of septic matter in the bowels
is a constant source of danger, affecting
blood and nerves.
The question is—How can we keep the liver
in order ?
According to the most distinguished medical
evidence, the Liver is amenable to
Kutnow’s Powder.
The Liver is responsive to the action of
Kutnow’s Powder, without the patient
being hardly aware of it.
Kutnow’s Powder is delightfully gentle, pain-
less, and soothing, but its beneficial
effect does not finish with the Liver.
It flushes the kidneys, cleanses the bladder,
regulates the bowels, clears and purifies
the whole alimentary canal.
No artificial remedy can supersede the
natural efficiency of Kutnow’s Powder,
it has an immediate effect.
It makes you feel relieved and gay ; you can
then put your heart into your work and
do your best.
It gives you vigor, and vigor is contagious,
furnishing untiring strength and vital
force.
An inactive Liver has a most depressing
effect on the temperament, but Kutnow’s
Powder quickly relieves the tension.
Kutnow’s Powder keeps every organ in the
body fit, free, and in thorough working
order, hence health follows as matter of
course.
LITER
ITS USE AND ABUSE.
The Liver, like the Kidneys and other organs, is liable to
various acute and chronic diseases. It is the great wheel of
life’s machine ; it regulates the whole mechanism of man ;
when it works well—then every other gland and factor in the
system works well, and there is general good health. That is
the use of the Liver. The abuse is brought about by our
mode of living ; the consumption of rich food and alcoholic
stimulants is a conscious abuse; we know it, but neglect to
arrest the damage by neutralising and correcting the mischief
until the liver becomes sluggish. The first sign of oncoming
disorder is headache, then a disagreeable taste in the mouth,
loss of appetite, biliousness, and constipation. The remedy
for this state of affairs is a dose of that famous Liver regulator,
Kutnow’s Powder. A desert spoonful in a glass of water,
before breakfast, acts like a refreshing bath on the whole
system ; it cleanses the stomach, liver, kidneys, and bowels,
and gets rid of the poisonous debris so injurious to health.
TO KEEP THE LIVER ACTIVE.
Perhaps you are not aware that the enjoyment of life
depends to a large extent on the healthy activity of the Liver.
If you wish to enjoy your food, to be able to digest almost
anything, take a few doses of Kutnow’s Powder, which rouses
the liver, flushes the food passages, clears away the sour
fermented debris, expels the surplus uric acid, and invigorates
the system.
A FAMOUS ROYAL ACADEMICIAN
WRITES :

“ I have used ETutnow’s Powder for the last five years, and it has

Nature all this time. lam now strong and healthy, and give you

THE REMEDY.
Are you anxious to maintain the healthy
action of the liver and kidneys and to per-
manently eradicate constipation ? Then send
to the nearest chemist for a bottle of
Kutnow’s Powder. This will set you right.
Dr. H. FOREST/ER
WRITES :
“ Aix-les-Bains, Oct. 2nd, 1905.
“I have frequently prescribed Kutnow’s Powder
for my patients, and always found it most useful
in uric aid troubles, Rheumatism and Gout. It
has also proved itself very beneficial in cases of
Constipation and Hemorrhoids. My experience,
both in hospital and private practice, shows that
Kutnow’s Powder greatly helps to correct faulty
tissue metabolism.

“ I feel bound to add my grateful testimony to
the merits of Kutnow’s Powder. Although
having no faith in any medicine for the habitual
and severe constipation I have sufiered from for
nearly 20 years, I procured a bottle. Its effect
was all that I could desire, bringing about a
gentle, natural action, almost unfelt, and leaving
the bowels in a healthy, natural state.

How to detect Fraudulent
Substitutes.
Be careful to avoid spurious substitutes, which are
sometimes sold for a few pence less. The purchaser,
through a misdirected spirit of economy, little thinks
that he is the means of a direct incentive to fraud. The
genuine and original Kutnow’s Powder is alone strongly
recommended by all leading physicians for the stomach,
liver, kidneys, and bowels. Insist on getting Kutnow’s,
which you can obtain at all conscientious chemists
throughout the world. See that the fac-simile signature,
“S. Kutnow and Co., Ltd.,” and the registered trade
mark, “ Hirschensprung, or Deer Deep,” are on the
carton and bottle. You will then avoid imitations
and know
How to get genuine Kutnow’s

MANAGING AGENTS: BURNS, PHILP AND COMPANY, LIMITED.
OFFICES : 10 BRIDGE STREET, SYDNEY.
THIS Company is being formed to acquire lands, principally in the Solomon Islands Group, and to
develop them by the establishment of plantations of cocoanuts, rubber, bananas, fibres, and other
valuable tropical products. It will also take power in its Articles of Association to engage in any
other business incidental to the Islands.
«00 Shares equal to £20,000, have already been applied for by persons who are acquainted intimately
with Island conditions. When 300 shares, equal to £30,000, are allotted, the company will be considered
aS of Cocoanut Plantations is to be the main object of the Company as being the surest
and most easily worked source of revenue. The Company, however, do not propose waiting seven or eurht
years until the cocoanuts mature for the payment of dividends, but, taking advantage of the regular steam
service under Commonwealth Mail Contract, they purpose planting Bananas and other products between
the voung Cocoanut trees, and, as these plants mature quickly, profitable business with Australia shou d
be attained after the second year, probably enabling dividends to be paid, whilst development work would
still be going on at capital cost. ,
A block of 10,000 acres of rich agricultural land on the Island of Guadalcanar has been applied for on a
999 years’ lease and only awaits the formal approval of the High Commissioner to be available for work.
A valuable plantation of about 8000 acres at Manning Straits, embracing a number of small islands
partly planted, has been purchased on behalf of the Company. This is one of the best situated properties
in the Solomon Islands, and is looked upon as a very advantageous purchase, both by reason of its situation,
the nature of its soil, the value of the improvements already placed upon it, and the fishing rights,
especially for Turtle Shell, from which an appreciable revenue is expected to be derived.
A freehold purchase has also been made of the Island of Tetipari, or Montgomery Island, estimated at
about 40 square miles (25,600 acres), with about 8000 to 10,000 acres suitable for cocoanuts, and the balance
forest country, containing much valuable timber, to be exploited at a convenient time. Other freehold
purchases of land are being negotiated at suitable spots. , . ,
The General Management of the Company would be undertaken by Burns, Philp, and Company, Limited,
and attached to the Isfand Department under the special supervision of Mr. Lucas, the Company’s Island
Manager. With an experienced staff afloat and ashore, and the whole of 8., P. Co.’s organisation working in
harmony to attain success, it is confidently expected that the Solomon Islands Development Company will
be more advantageously placed for efficient and economical working than any other Island Company could
h n°ofFeVi n g- these properties for flotation, the Provisional Directors wish to state that, everything being
offered at actual cost, no profit whatever is made by anyone in the formation of the Company, and the
Shareholders will reap the full benefit of the cash purchases made, and of the applications for lands now
under consideration by 7 the British authorities.

FROOTOIDS
For Headache, Indigestion,
Constipation, and Biliousness.
OOO
The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
power over the above-named complaints.
They are elegant in appearance, pleasant
to take, and, what is of the utmost
importance, are thoroughly reliable in
affording quick relief.
Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so far
that they not only act as an aperient,
but do remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident at once by the disappearance of
headache, the head becoming clear, and
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when Con-
gestion of the Brain or Apoplexy is pre-
sent or threatening. They have been
tested, and have been proved to afford
quick relief in such cases when other
aperients have not done any good at all.
It is of the utmost importance that this
should be borne in mind, for in such
cases to take an ordinary aperient is to
waste time and permit of a serious ill-
ness becoming fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
“antibilious pills” make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill by
“antibilious pills” who could have been
cured at once by Frootoids. People
should not allow themselves to be duped
into contracting a medicine-taking habit
by being persuaded to take daily doses
with each meal of so-called indigestion
cures that do NOT cure. Frootoids
have been subjected to extensive tests,
and have in every case proved success-
ful in completely curing the complaints
named.
The ordinary adult dose of Frootoids,
of which there are 72 in a bottle, is 2 to
4 —more or less as required—taken, pre-
ferably at bedtime, when constipated,
or at the commencement of any other
disease requiring an aperient, as an
auxilliary with the special medicine
necessary for the case. A constipated
habit of body will be completely cured
if the patient will on each occasion,
when suffering, take a dose of Frootoids,
instead of an ordinary aperient; making
the interval between the taking of each
dose longer and the dose smaller. The
patient thus gradually becomes indepen-
dent of Aperient Medicines.

RUPTURE
Varicocele Gan Be Cured!
THE CAUSE OF MORE WRECKS THAN ANY OTHER DISEASE.
IT CAN BE CURED BY ELECTRICITY.
Thousands of men have Varicocele and are ignorant of the harm which may result. They only know that something is
draining the vim and ambition from their bodies and brains, and know of no reason to account for it. This terrible
affliction is the most treacherous, silent and certain in its work of all known ailments. It comes on without apparent cause,
and never ceases in its destructive influence until it robs a man of all his vitality and leaves him a physical and mental wreck,

DRUGS ARE USELESS!
for the cure of Varicocele and its concurrent or attending weaknesses. Applied exter-
nally or internally drugs usually prove either ineffectual or injurious. There are many
wavs of treating it, but none is so sure of success as properly-applied Electricity. We
have devoted twenty years to the study of Electricity for the cure of this and kindred
ailments, and have cured 5000 cases of Varicocele. We have cured cases of thirty years
standing', where the patients had exhausted all other known treatments without relief,
and who’came to us in a state of complete debility. DR. MeLAUGHLIN’S
ELECTRIC BELT and electric suspensory —our method —has cured after the
knife, injection, ligation and every other known means had failed. We have cured
physicians, lawyers, ministers, merchants and laborers. We use a method of our
own ; one which is the result of vast experience during the past twenty years. We have
an electric body battery which can be worn comfortably while the patient sleeps at
night, and which gives a powerful yet soothing current that is always under control.
It pours its vitalizing energy into the body for six to eight hours every night in a
manner which dissolves the congestion, assists the circulation, gives contraction to
relaxed cords and restores strength. If you are tired of useless drugging and have spent
your time and money without benefits, write to-day. We have made over 50,000
people strong and vigorous, and they never tire of praising our wonderful remedy.
It is a positive cure for all Weaknesses, Nervousness, Varieoeele, Loss of Vitality, Stomach,
Kidney and Liver Troubles, Rheumatism, Sciatica and Lumbago, and when used with our
newly-patented electro-plastic truss, is a certain cure for Rupture. ... It is easy to use ; no sting,
burn or shock; put it on when you go to bed, and you get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old
colt. They are guaranteed to give a strong current, instantly felt, and have special attachments for men.
They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up. Beware of cheap imitations.

of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,

remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as “run-down” or ‘‘out of sorts.” Females

remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every

HEARNES
BRONCHITIS
CURE
The Famous Remedy for
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS. ASTHMA, & CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where “ Coughs” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of KEARNS'S BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, Small Size, 2/6; Large Size, 4/6. Sold by Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Forwarded to any Address, when not obtainable locally.
NOTlCE.—Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. lAdoes NOT contain any poison within the meaning of the Act. It is equally beneficial for the youngest
_ child and the most aged person.
BENGER’S FOOD is quite
distinct from any other. It
possesses the remarkable property
of rendering milk with which it
is mixed when used, quite easy of

rood
One of the most valuable foods
known to science. It gives the

with complete or partial rest to

IT MAKES YOU SHUDDER!
No matter how dainty food may be. or how carefully prepared, It Is
simply repugnent to you if your stomach Is out of order. That dull pain
in your stomach causes you to Simply loathe the sight of food -you can-
not eat. and yet you want something and don’t know what. When you
do eat. you suffer tortures afterwards. Do you realise what will happen
to you if you continue in this way ? Your body will become depleted and
any sickness is apt to take hold of you. If you escape such evils, you
will do as lots of other dyspeptics have done—die of exhaustion.
You positively can avoid all these troubles by taking
Dr. SBELDOI'S
The reason why any wholesome food is not properly digested Is because
the stomach lacks some important element of digestion. Some stomachs
lack peptone, others are deficient in gastric juice or hydrochloric acid
The one thing necessary in any case of poor digestion, is to supply those
digestive elements which the stomach lacks, and nothing does this so
thoroughly and safely as DR. SHELDON'S DIGESTIVE TABULES.
They digest what you eat, thus giving the stomach a rest and assistance
until it is restored to its normal action and vigor.
One of these Tabules will digest 1500 grains of meat, eggs, and other
wholesome food. They are a genuine tonic, because they bring about in
the only natural way a restoration of nerve power, a building up, of lost
tissue and appetite, by the digestion and assimilation of wholesome food.

The Man Who Doesn’t Matter.

What creed is this Australia hears—
That feelings patriotic
should guide our legislative seers ?
Such views are quite exotic.
The foreigner who dwells afar,
Contriving legislation,
Full well he knows the workers are
The backbone of the nation ;
And in the land of Kaiser Bill,
Which yearly waxes fatter,
The statesmen strive with earnest will
The toiler’s woes to scatter.
But Ours announce with voices shrill—
“ The Workman doesn’t matter ! ”
His voting strength outnumbers all
The other franchised classes ;
And yet, at the ditvision-call,
His members join the asses !
The Johnsons, Liddells, Smiths, and Gooks--
The shameless gang that bellows
For foreign goods, from ships to books,
And blow their toiling fellows !
’Tis strange how insignificant
Their interests become then ;
But at the polls their members rant,
And bang their fearsome drum then !
The workman is a deity—
No heathen could fall flatter
Than Labor’s shrill would-be Ms.P.
Before the smith or hatter ;
But when at stake his job they see—
Why, then He Doesn’t Matter !
Good simple chap—right well they know
the surest way to fool him ;
Millenniums they vend, and so
His so-called servants rule him !
By heaving language through their necks
In junks immense and rapid,
T * ie y g&ther in his vote, and vex
The gods with rnouthings vapid.
If talk would feed the artisan,
And gas and blare sustain him,
His lot content he well might scan—
But sad misgivings pain him !
For lo ! the jawful Tillett tribe,
The Manns and Macs a-patter,
Who wave the fearsome diatribe,
Do naught to fill his platter !
“ Am I the man ” —he breathes the gibe—
“ The Man who Doesn’t Matter?”
Some day perchance the Working Man
Will grip the situation ;
Will heave half-way to Kordofan,
The foes of this our Nation ;
So 'j’ e day, perhaps, he’ll understand
Why work and Wages vanish ;
And then with grim and heavy hand
The bloated Trusts he’ll banish ;
But as things are, his own Ms.P.
Go forth, elate, to shatter
The frame-work of Prosperity—

Whilst he—he trudges hopelessly,

GRANT HERVEY.
The Landlady of St. Genesis’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE’S one great relief about having our
own place,” said little Joe, the Hebrew,
looking round the assembled members of
the Honorable Order of Bloques. “ One hasn’t
to be eternally considering how to manage the
landlady. I only struck one ideal landlady in my
life, and that was the one at St. Genesis’s Priory,
the place I left to come here.
‘ I had tried all manner of treatments. Some-
times I took their awful daughters to the theatres;
sometimes I took the old girls themselves ; and
when they were altogether unpresentable, I used
to come home at nights with a bottle of ale
under my huckster. But it all made no differ-
ence. In a few weeks you found a cake of
aundry soap in place of your own best
white rose ; the towels became the towel, and a
rag at that; and the candle never more than an inch
°ng. Then they would bring in one small chop
for breakfast on Sunday moaning. After that, it
was time to pack up.
Well, when I went to St. Genesis it was like
eaven, only more human. Nice big garden, lots
o shade and flowers, fine large lofty rooms with
neaps of windows and ventilation, and all that sort
o thing, you know. And not the least attractive
eature of the place was the beautiful, brown-eyed,
white-haired widow who was hostess. I asked
her twice to marry me, but she refused on the
grounds that she was old enough to be my mother.
One day there came to St. Genesis a long,
agreeable bloque, with a face grim as a stage
Paate s. He was well read, and talked interest-
mgly of anything anyone mentioned, and possessed
a und of quiet, subtle humor. He broke up
e traditions of the place by paying a month’s
in advance. The Widow became mildly
suspicious. She had taken paying guests before
w o had planked down a month’s money in
a vance, and invariably found that they got a
onth in arrears on the strength of it, after which
rney left ignominiously.
i . ® ut Ulverstone, that was his name, took the
es ro °rn in the house, and next day his luggage
1^ e a ‘ on g- It was good to look upon. He had
bn L er { e l e gantly-equipped apartment as it stood,
th nf? e .b rou ght in the rosewood sideboard
_ held his liqueur sets, and placed his majolica
to eS J- bis pipe-stand of ivory and silver, on
cor ° lt ’ stowec * aw ’ay a roll-top desk in the
litH e f’ stuc k his alabaster statuettes on the
lov ra ?h et;s > and threw a whole of other
sly things round the place, it was just palatial.
! P w* s a good sort, too. He invited us up,
r; T, c h°' ce drinks and smokes, and spun us
« tales there till i g.nr. He told us he was a

Then h f d l e >. bur gled in between times.
C 'h rarS into all our Pockets,

noisily away to our rooms.
Widow wa? JP? f h , is en S a R' n g manners, the

a though her great mass of hair was white, her face
uidn t look a day over 35.
“ But when the first month was in its last week
Ulverstone planked down another six quid, and
immediately became star boarder and white-haired
y. How he managed to do this was a mystery
‘‘ A S f, a r ,l le ’ T riters are shocki ngly hard up.’
After that she used to take her troubles to
him, and always got good advice and sometimes
money. She commenced to lose interest in the
rest of the house, we thought. Mind you, there
was nothing to complain of. The soap main-
tained its standard, the candles were as long as
ever, and the towels changed twice a week re-
gular. But somehow, we felt that she had ceased
to be interested in us.
“He was a tiger for work. No matter how
early I arose and strolled down the balcony to
say good morning and help him with the milk and
rum, I would find him bending oyer his type-
writer on the desk. And no matter how late I
came home—and as I was keeping books lor a
Christian Gentleman who was in the money-
lending business to 1 assist and not to crush,’ you
can bet your collective lives I didn’t come home
too early—or rather I did, a darned sight
too early—well, there he would be, in a silk shirt
and pants, plugging away at the old machine.
When he had been there' about three months
he discovered, somehow, that the Widow was
short of furniture, and immediately he decided
that he would furnish his own room. So the
Widow took her furniture out, and Ulverstone’s
quarters became more palatial than ever,
“After this, Ulverstone supplanted the Deity
in the estimation of the Widow. The religious
training of a well-spent life vanished before his
subtle influence, and she gave him open and un-
disguised worship. She made him the standard
of perfection, and gauged everybody’s worth by
their proximity to, or distance from, Ulverstone.
We liked the man, and hated to see him'placed on
a pedestal off which he must inevitably fall, with
disastrous consequences to himself. The Widow
struggled gamely, but at last went under.
“One night we met him down town, and he
lugged us all round to the Cafe Paris, and told us
to wade in. We demurred. There were six of
us besides himself, and seven suppers at the Cafe
1 aris cost something, and a man sometimes does
things when he’s feeling good and merry that he
cannot afford.
lie seemed dazed at our refusal, and then,
drawing me aside, asked the wherefore of it. I
explained. He laughed, and led the way to
where an ideal waiter made eating a pleasure. I
felt sure he must be a prosperous burglar.
“When we left the cafe he called up seven
cabs, placed a man in each, and led the proces*
sion home in style* When we arrived at s>t.
Genesis’s not a man could find the keyhole— ,ve
Couldn’t reach it even, for I regret to say we
travelled from the garden gate to the front door
on all fours, and, arriving there, hiccupped loudly
for the Widow to open the door.
“ She came at last. We saw her dimly, a
Vision of glowing beauty in the midst of a nimbus
of golden effulgence, staring wonderingly at what
must have looked like a collection of baboons on
the verandah. Fortunately, we all had sense
enough not to make asses of ourselves by trying
to explain things, and we saw her shrink back
and stand as if spellbound while that weird pro-
cession wound past her and silently made its way
upstairs, on all fours, Ulverstone himself leading
the way.
* * * *
“Next day our collective name was Slush—
Ulverstone, of course, excepted. He could do no
wrong, and the Widq.w blamed us for taking the
Saint out and getting him tangled up, just to
throw bad beer over her ideal. She announced
firmly that she would take all sorts of care that
we didn’t lead him into temptation again. And
give her her due, she certainly did make home
attractive to him. She was dreadfully in love,
and buzzed round him like a bee round
a thistle blossom. She was his for the
asking, and the beggar never made the request.
When her work was done, she would steal up to
his balcony, sit in the shade of the cloth-of-gold
ro%es that climbed over the railing to the roof
beyond, and while he worked she would gaze at
him in silent worship. Sometimes, with a shud-
der, she would remember that dark picture of the
baboon-like figures that wound out of the dark-
ness, up the stairs into darkness ; but she told us,
with flashing eyes, that, all the same, even in his
drunkenness, he was a gentleman, and our ‘ vile
work ’ could not destroy his ideality.

‘ ‘ One night I came home early, just a few minutes
after 11 p. m., and as I swung off the tram I saw
a woman entering the Priory gate, with a basket
on her arm. She walked across the lawn to the
big front doon, and had just reached the verandah
when I slammed the gate. She turned round and
waited. Her face was hidden by a broad-leafed
hat, and further obscured by a streamer that hung
down at one side. She asked me to give Mr.
Ulverstone the basket as soon as I went in.
“ I assured her it would be done, and stepped
on to the verandah.
“ ‘ Will you be sure he opens it to-night ? ’ she
inquired.
“‘ I will, madame. By the way, what name
shall I give ? ’
“ ‘ Oh, he’ll know who it is from when he opens
the basket,’ she said emphatically, and went off.
“ I took the basket upstairs and pounded gaily
on Ulverstone’s door.
“ ‘ A young woman gave me this to give you,
and I was to be sure you opened it to-night ! ’ I
explained.
“‘Ah! Where did she give it you?’ he
gasped, and an anxious look came over his face.
“ ‘ She was coming in as I got off the tram, and
I overtook her on the verandah. She asked me
to be sure you opened it to-night ! 5 and I held

Efficiency Depends upon Health. Health Depends upon the Kidneys.
Ever} 7 man or woman who works must keep healthy, if work is to be done efficiently. The unfit go to the wall. Good
work depends upon good health. Work becomes a nightmare to those who are not well. ARE YOU EFFICIENT?
Or are you Depressed, Tired, Suffering from Broken Sleep, Backache, Pains in the Limbs, Bad Taste in the Mouth ? All
these are symptoms that your kidneys are weak or diseased, and unable to carry out their work of filtering the blood nnd
keeping it pure. The Kidneys are the Filters of Life. All these
symptoms are forerunners of Dropsy, Rheumatism, Urinary
Diseases, Gravel, Stone, Neuralgia, all of which are Kidney Dieases.
Only a kidney medicine can cure you. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills act on the kidneys, and on the kidneys only. They will keep
you bright, free from pain, backache and headache. They will
keep you efficient.
Lasting Sydney Cure.
Mr. John Loaney, 20 Swanson Street, Erskinevillo, states: —“I wish to give you particulars of my
experience with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I owe these Pills a debt of gratitude, for they have cured
me of very serious Kidney disease. My ill-health commenced three years ago, when I first had to lay
up. I had terrible pains in my back and right side, and my secretions scalded, and were thick, and con-
tained sedimentary matter. I also had fits of giddiness, and every day I would have a violent headache.
For two years I spent an average of two weeks out of every three in bed, and even when I was up I was
very ill. I was very weak, and fell away. 1 had the best medical advice and treatment to be procured ;
ten leading Sydney Physicians treated me in the three years of my illness; their bills totalled £lBO.
The general idea was that I suffered with stone in the kidneys, and I was constantly advised to undergo
an operation.. At last a Specialist put me under the X-Rays ; he found no foreign substance in the kid-
neys, but a dark veil enveloped the right kidney, showing pronounced disease. He told me that it was
unnecessary to be operated on, as my kidneys were too far gone for an operation to benefit me.
“ I gave up all hope of recovery, and fully expected to die soon, and my friends were of the same
opinion. My lawyer was brought home, and made out my will—l was held up to sign it. Not long after
this I was advised to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. The man who had urged me to give this remedy
a trial had been cured by it, and had the utmost faith in its healing properties, lie told me he had been
doubled up with the ailment, and not able to get about at all, and one box had cured him, and for good.
One could not but be convinced that he was in thorough earnest, so I sent for a supply to Ellis’s Pharmacy,
Erskineville. I used nine boxes, and was cured. I felt no good effects until I was using the third box,
and after that my recovery was gradual. I left off taking the Pills four months ago, and have not needed
to take one since, and am still in the best of health.’
On 9th February, 1907, Mrs. Loaney says : —“ The above is true, and lam pleased to say my husband
is still free of kidney trouble. In fact he was never better in his life, and is without ache or pain. I
think this is marvellous, for he is 76.”

out the basket, which was fairly heavy, to him to
take. ,
“ He backed away from the door, and looked
irresolute :
“ ‘ Bring it in and put it on the sofa,’ he said
in a whisper.
“ As I placed the basket on the sofa he got the
whisky decanter. I turned to go. He gripped
me by the arm :
“ ‘ Don’t go, old man, for Heaven’s sake. Here,
have a whisky before we open that basket. ’
“ I gaped at him. After that I drank the
whisky resolutely.
“ Then we both went over to the basket on the
sofa. The lid was secured in the ordinary way
by a stick passed through wicker staples which
projected through the lid.
“ Ulverstone took out the stick, and hesitated
for a moment before he lifted the lid of the
basket. The first thing we saw was a lace hand-
kerchief, and his hand shook so that he could not
lift it. I took it by the corner, and raising it saw
that, sure enough, there was the face of a babe.
He wasn’t dead —not by a long chalk. He was
fast asleep on his right side, and clutching a warm
feeding-bottle firmly between two chubby pink
hands.
“ Ulverstone gazed steadfastly at the sleeping
babe, and then glanced at me. Then he reached
for more whisky.
“ If ever a child was his father’s son it was
that nipper. He had a face like a prize-fighter.
Baby as he was, his jaw was firmly defined, and
his upper lip reminded me of Shelley’s description
of the mouth of Omniades, the King of Kings,
and his hands—they were built for strength.
Everything about the kiddie was indicative of
strength.
“ Ulverstone lifted him out of the basket, and
the babe, dropping the bottle in the act of waking
up, looked round, and clutched wildly for his
feeding apparatus. Not finding it, he didn’t cry
—he scolded ; and I picked the thing up and gave
it to the little bully quickly. He jammed the
mouthpiece between his lips, and, with one eye
fixed on the light, commenced to suck with all his
might. In io seconds he was asleep.
“ ‘This is a lovely complication,' said Ulver-
stone. ‘ Suppose he starts to yell like fury in the
middle of the night ? I can’t give him any more
food, and babies always want about three feeds at
night, don’t they ? ’
“ ‘ Blowed if I know —perhaps she’s sent along
his tucker with him. She ought to have done so,
considering the ungodly hour she brought him ! ’
I snorted, diving into the basket.
“ And there, sure enough, was the whole para-
phernalia : bottle of stuff looking like crushed
biscuits, small bottle of clear fluid, which I know
now was lime water, and xn extra feeder.
“‘I suppose you’b board him out?’ I
hazarded.
“ ‘ No fear. Now I’ve got him, I’ll keep him.
Wonder what made her bring him along ? ’
“ ‘ If I knew the history of the case I might be
able to tell you,’ I insinuated softly.
“ But he never unfolded the plot. Instead, he
stole down to the door of the Widow’s room and
called her name softly. I stood on the landing
and listened, for, somehow, I guessed the Widow
would misunderstand.
“ She opened that door so quietly that it was
only his whispered request to her to come up-
stairs that intimated it was open. The Widow
made no reply, and I guessed she was looking at
him with her great brown eyes full of mingled
adoration and speculation. Again Ulverstone
whispered to her to come upstairs, and I saw him
turn to go.
“ After what seemed a tremendous time there
was a faint rustle outside and then the door
opened silently, admitting the Widow. Three
little red rose-buds gleamed in her hair, lending a
faint glow to her curiously youthful face. She
entered with a half-timid, half-reckless smile, but
immediately she caught sight of me her whole
expression changed. She laid one hand on the
table and looked from one to the other.
“ ‘ A new boarder has arrived ! ’ I said airily,
pointing to the basket.
“ With a curious, harsh, unlovely expression I
had never seen on her face before she walked over
to the basket and looked in. For a moment
her face blanched, her hands clenched, and then
she suddenly threw up her arms in despair, and
before I could catch her flopped down in a sitting
posture and sobbed.
‘ 1 Then as suddenly she sprang to her feet, and
approached Ulverstone :
‘ ‘ ‘ Tell me, are you a married man ? ’ she
asked in a low, scared voice. The red blood
surged up through her neck to her face, and, my
Uncle ! she did look ripping.
“ ‘ Will you take charge of him for the night,
and to-morrow I’ll get a wet nurse for him ? ’ re-
marked Ulverstone, nonchalantly, as he lifted his
son out of the basket.
“ I was standing near the door, and suddenly
the Widow pushed me out of it :
“‘What are you standing there for?’ she
snapped, as the door closed on me. As no one
asked me to re-enter, although I wanted to very
badly, I told myself I didn’t care a hang, and
went to my own room.
“ Half-an-hour later I heard the Widow come
out, and, peeping through the crack ot the door,
saw Ulverstone lighting her downstairs.
“In her arms she carried the baby with the
prize-fighter face.”
* * * * *
“ After that she was quite changed. We rarely
saw her. A maid took her place at table, and
she devoted all her time to that terrible baby. He
was fierce as a tiger, too, and used to strike at her
with his little fists when things were not to his
liking. He had great agate eyes, and when he
was pleased they would beam, and he would put
his brown, chubby arms round the Widow’s neck.
Then the Widow would blush with pleasure. I
used to watch her through the Venetian blinds of
my balcony window.
“ One Sunday afternoon I saw them talking
opposite his door. He seemed unusually grave.
His bull-faced son was crowing and shouting.
Suddenly Ulverstone’s arm stole round the lady’s
neck. He bent over to kiss her. Out shot the
pug baby’s little right fist and landed right in his
father’s eye. Ulverstone shot back as though a
mule had kicked him. Then he hurried inside,
and re-appeared with a wet handkerchief. She
held the baby with one arm while she anxiously
examined the eye, pressing back the lid with the
fingers of her disengaged hand.
“Then they kissed in spite of the baby.
“ Next day we got notice. St. Genesis was to
be no longer a boarding-house. That’s all ! ”

Noiseville.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS is not Fogtown. It’s Noiseville—
and mine is the noisiest street in the
noisiest city on earth, bar Chicago.
London as the chief city of the world is an utter
failure. It is dismal, dull, dirty. And if there’s
a synonym for noise beginning with “ d ” you may
add it to the other adjectives.
All the houses in this street facing Hyde Park
and Kensington Palace are of five storeys, of half-
burnt bricks and stucco—ugly, repulsive, for-
bidding, without architectural beauty, all dark
inside, and having neither yards nor lifts.
Formerly the street —Howard-street —was an aris-
tocratic centre, and the houses only held noble-
men. The last nobleman to leave, because “those
horrid hotels’’ squeezed him out, was Daniel
Cooper, whose father was a Sydney peer of pure
blue blood and illustrious lineage. He sold a
£30,000 house for £lO,OOO, and a girls’ finishing
school holds the ancestral halls of the Coopers.
Howard-street is paved with jarrah blocks, and,
being practically a cut de sac, the noise ascends
most damnably. It begins at 3 a.m. with the Bridge-
players and other debauchees driving up in han-
soms, banging the hansom door and then the hotel
door, while the cabby roars his thanks or impreca-
tions to the accompaniment of the jangling bells
on his horse’s neck. At 4 o’clock the merry milk-
walkers arrive in battalions, with myriads of tin
cans, wit and rum exuding from every pore.
Some of them dance, others sing, and all of them
whistle. As there has only been one musical
Englishman since 1066—Charlie Santley, and he’s
a knight, not a singer now—the effect of the
efforts of the devotees of Terpsichore and her two
sisters, whose names I can’t remember (my
Thesaurus and classical dictionary are at home in
Melbourne), resembles no noise so much as that
made by the importers about our new tariff. At
five arrive the coal carts to pour coal down shoots
in the footpath into that extraordinary dungeon
called “the area,” where the English do
their cooking and lodge their servants.
They can’t shoot coal without noise,
and as every house gets its fuel by the
bushel the noise is perennial. At six, the
30 girls in the ex-Cooper mansion start practising
the piano, the violin, and “ah—ah—ah.” About
seven, the Walpurgis night ends with the hearty
whole-souled row caused by hundreds of trades-
men’s carts and waggons, every driver of which is
full of Pink ’Un and Titbits wit. (By the
way, the Pink ’Un regularly steals The
Bulletin’s stories, and often spoils them
in the stealing.) At eight, the German
band celebrates the breaking of day with the
Tannhauser March and the “Watch on the
Rhine.” At nine, all the dogs in the street, which
have been sleeping on their mistresses’ beds, are
turned out for a stroll, and it costs the City of
Westminster £6OOO a year to keep the footpaths
clean. At ten, the harpist, the concertina-player
the organ-grinder from Florence (whenceeomesalso
Tetrazzini), the singing widow, the unemployed
workman vocalists, and the porters whistling f or
cabs and roaring out loudly always, give promise
of a lively day free from rest and quiet. Then
comes along that curse of big cities, the motor-car
with its road hog and its Atlantic syren. Oc-
casionally, a motor ’bus rushes by, stinking and
shrieking, and (fortunately) not paying, spite of
stink or shriek.
And the music-halls are full of noise, the parks
full of bands and blare, the trams noisy beyond
description. Men and women yell at one another
in the street and restaurants, and all the markets
are maelstroms of hideous sounds. A doctor told
me he could not auscultate patients at a leading
hospital before 2 a.m. because of the overpowering
street noises ! At the Lord Mayor’s Show there
were 23 bands, most of ihem playing at once, in a
street half the width of the narrowest, choke-bore
part of George-street, Sydney.
I’ve got nostalgia, and want to get back home
to a quiet, gentlemanly country.

Land of Promise
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LAND of promise long belated,
Land of heathen variegated,
Land of much best left unstated—
Dim, wide North !
On a close investigation there’s a potent fascina-
tion
In the blazing, sweating, thirst-begetting North.
Do the hum-drum tasks grow galling?
Does Adventure keep a-calling ?
Is the Wild your soul enthralling ?
Roam the North !
In that untamed, spacious region you may join
the vanguard legion
Of the ill-protected, long-neglected North.
Do the social fetters fret you,
And the Philistines beset you ?
Does some siren seek to net you ?
Get you North !
For the bondage of convention is a thing too slight
to mention
In the conscience-easy, go-as-please-ye North.
Do you pine for wider spaces ?
Are you choked with commonplaces?
Would you shun your fellow’s faces ?
Seek the North !
You may tread where none before you trod, and
drop the curtain o’er you
In the dark, immuring, trail-obscuring North.
Poets, Prosemen, if it chances
That you need new stock of fancies,
Waste no time—direct your glances
To the North.
From the West you’ve drawn good measure, yet
there waits no less a treasure
In the coruscating, palpitating North.

Mr. J. Williams, of Northern Sta-
tion, N. E. Port Augusta, sends his
photo and writes that he has been a
sufferer from impure blood and indi-
gestion, with pimples on his face, and
blackheads. He was always taking
medicines of some kind, with no re-
lief until he began with Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla and Ayer’s Pills. He took
in all three bottles of the Sarsaparilla
"and two bottles of the Pills, with the
result that the pimples and black-
heads disappeared and he was relieved
entirely of his indigestion.
AYER’S S arsapariMa
acts directly upon the blood-forming glands of the body, stimulating them to
produce healthy, rich, red blood ; the kind of blood that brings a good' whole-
some color to the lips and cheeks, clearing away pimples and blackheads.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol. Be
sure that you get “AYER’S,” not some worthless imitation.

AN ENGLISH NEVEL
The Keynote of John Trevena’s Furze the
Gruel (Alston Rivers, per Sydney Book
Club) is the inherent cruelty of Nature, in
eluding that of man. Furze the Cruel is the
first portion of a projected trilogy of Dart-
moor, in which furze, heather and granite—
the three most characteristic features of that
locality—impersonate cruelty, endurance anc
strength. And the reader looking for a con-
tinuance of the idyllic treatment of English
country-life will be as disappointed as if he
had picked up The Souse with Green Shut-
ters under the misapprehension that it was
one of the series of the kail-yard school.
For this is a brutal and pitiless novel, and
cruelty is fitly its theme. “ Nothing in the
entire system of creation,” says Trevena,
‘‘can be more inexplicable than the per-
sistent cruelty of Nature. Death there must
be, but Nature resents a painless death.
Animals not only kill, but torture, those
which are inferior to them. Mason-wasps
deliberately vivisect spiders, which are
insects extremely tenacious of life. It is the
same all the way along the scale up to and
including man. Nature does her work with
bloody hands ; birth, life, death, become a
miserable dabble of blood and passion.
Some people shut their eyes to it all; others
cannot; others add to it; churches with
their tolling bells and black masses revel in
the mystic side of it.”
Such is Trevena’s thesis, and he evinces
proof that in Dartmoor cruelty is as common
as furze. For Travena knows his back-
ground. His people are either adding to
Nature’s cruelty or suffering from it. And
Pendoggat—they have names like that in
England—is the spirit of the furze. “He
resembled it in its fierceness, its spitefulness,
its tenacity of life ; but not in its beauty and
fragrance. He brought forth no golden
blossoms.” As a matter of fact, he killed the
two children he had. But there is another
spirit of the furze, a girl with hair of the
color of the furze-blossoms, and in her idyll
the reader has a needed respite from this
record of cruelty. With the hopelessness of
these savages, with their undeveloped minds,
their futile cunning, their tenacity of life,
this book is full ; and Trevena makes up an
indictment against the Dartmoor peasant
that it will need very circumstantial evidence
to refute. He blames the Dartmoor religion.
His faith is as dark and ugly as the bottom
of a well. The Dartmoor commoner has
little but his Hell-fire.”
The story is an attempt at a big novel of
the George Eliot kind, with a multitude of
characters, types neatly balanced, and a
carefully led-up-to climax. But, though an
interesting and praiseworthy handling of a
big theme, the book must be dropped to the
bottom of the F 2 class.
The Bookman’s prize for the six most fre-
quent misquotations was gained by these :
Music has charms to soothe a savage breast.
A little learning is a dangerous thing.
Water, water everywhere,
Nor any drop to drink.
Fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf.
None but the brave deserves the fair.
AH things come round to him who will hut wait.
