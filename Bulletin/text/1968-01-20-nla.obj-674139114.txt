Hitachi has long been an active participant in the technical
revolution brought about by the discovery of ways to put the
electron to work. Today, the company is firmly established as the
unsurpassed leader of Japanese industry. Its many-sided activities are
conducted in 19 factories, 3 research laboratories, and by the efforts
of 77,000 employees. Hitachi's 20,000 or so products cover a
tremendous range, from giant power generation installations, rolling
stock of all types, communications equipment, industrial machinery
large and small, down to familiar household appliances, and to the
most modern of solid state devices.
Hitachi makes constant efforts to further tame and train the electro
in order to develop new and better products for the|benefit of both
industry and the home, both in Japan and around the world.

ONE MORE
WEEK
ORSTRALIAN TO THE
BOOTSTRAPS
IN TIME we shall get used to having
a Prime Minister who calls this country
Orstralia. If Queen Elizabeth comes
here again, she and John Gorton will be
able to Orstralia away to each other
very happily.
However, it came as a surprise to
find from one of last week’s many tele-
vision interviews that we had a Min-
ister for Education who thought he was
paraphrasing Shakespeare when he pro-
vided his own version of “But that was
in another country and, besides, the
wench is dead.”
Still, this is another country and
there is no doubt that Mrs. Gorton’s
M.A. in Malayan studies will be more
useful than the Prime Minister’s second-
class M.A. (Oxon).
UP TO THE MINUTE
IN THE MIDST of the Prime Min-
isterial campaign, the Melbourne “Age”
was solemnly warning its readers that
to conform with the Electoral Act, all
letters to 'the Editor on the Senate elec-
tions must bear the name and address
of sender.
LARGE CAST
IT TOOK SIX men and a crane to
install the statue of Apollo on the stair-
case landing on the way to John
Hannan’s office. The statue is just one
of 53 Hannan has bought in the past
three years, but he felt it was worth
the trouble. After seeing it standing
rather forlornly in a Randwick garden,
he decided he had to have it before
vandals broke its other hand off and
before it grew more weather-pitted than
it is already.
Hannan, whose family still owns the
meat business his Irish grandfather
started 80 years ago, is publisher of
“The Australasian Antique Collector,”
inspired a year ago by his sudden but
powerfully burgeoning interest in classi-
cal statues.
Just how powerful it is can be judged
by his office. Once you edge around
Apollo and step gingerly across a
mammoth bearskin rug, complete with
a toothsome and ferocious-looking head,
you are confronted by what could be
the cast from a Greek Olympiad.
“These are actually the rejects,” Mr.
Hannan says mildly. “I can’t find room
for any more at home. I had some
friends in the other night and we were
sitting around talking, when one of them
said, ‘Do you realise there are 30 bronze
statues in this room?’ The place is like
a minefield.”
It all began with a statue called “The
Clapping Faun,” which Mr. Hannan
felt was “rather pleasant” and bought.
At that time, he knew nothing about
antiques, but the Faun became the yard-
stick for his subsequent purchases.
“I don’t even know why I picked on
bronzes to collect except that they
always seemed a little more substantial
than porcelain or something like that.
I know of about three other collectors
although there must be a few more.
Certainly, the prices have gone up since
I started. You could get quite a nice
bronze for £4O then.
“I used to haunt the dealers’ shops
at weekends, then one day I said to
Peter Cook at Grafton Galleries that
there should be some place where col-
lectors could advertise or communicate
somehow with other collectors. And he
said, ‘Well, why don’t you do some-
thing about it? You’re in a position
to.’ ”
In addition to their chain of butcher
shops, the Hannan family also publishes
a group of suburban newspapers, first
established when someone gave the
family a local newspaper in settlement
of a bad debt.
So Hannan decided to publish “The
Australasian Antique Collector,” with
Cook as its editor. The first issue went
out on glossy, good quality paper at
75 cents a copy, and 4000 were printed,
some of them sent to antique dealers
for sale to their customers.
But Hannan and Cook had under-
estimated the strength and enthusiasm
of Australian collectors. They had 1000 1
subscriptions after the first issue, and
the demand was so great that 'they re-
printed that issue. Circulation now
stands at 8000. “We did a lot of guess-
ing with that first edition, and we’ve
since had to adjust a few 'things the
price is now $l.
“But we were amazed at people’s
enthusiasm. You know, we ran a picture
of a christening mug in one issue. It
belongs to someone here in Sydney.
After the issue came out, a woman from
Adelaide rang me to find out where she
could get in touch with its owner. I
told her, but said he wouldn’t sell. But
she was determined, and took a plane
here frome Adelaide. He was adamant—
he wasn’t selling, but she was just as
adamant and finished by offering him
such a high price he just couldn’t refuse
it.”
But Mr. Hannan’s most prestigious
victory so far is a request he received
from the British -Museum for all the
magazine’s back copies. “That made my
day.”
He himself is still almost exclusively a
classical statue man, although he has
acquired a handsome side table which
was made for Governor King’s son.
“That would make it 1830 or so —
it’s probably Australian cedar, a copy
of what they were turning out in Eng-
land at that time. I had to have some-
thing to put the statues on.”
MINOR MYSTERY
THE PERILS OF AUTHORSHIP
are many, but Charlotte Jay, an Aus-
tralian thriller writer who has lived
since World War II mainly in England
and the East (her husband worked for
UNESCO), gave us an account of
something blood-curdlingly new in that
line. Author of some eight chillers, most
notably “A Hank of Hair,” which won
enthusiastic reviews from “The Sunday
Times” and “The New York Times,”
and a notable contributor to Collins’
Crime Club Series (she is now with
Heinemann), Charlotte Jay won the
Mystery Writers Inc.’s first annual
award in 1953 (Raymond Chandler
got it next time up) for “Beat Not the
Bones,” set in New Guinea.
The award was what Charlotte Jay’s
husband described to us as “a ghastly
little porcelain bust” of Edgar Allan
Poe. “We were living in Thailand when
the bust arrived,” Charlotte Jay told
us, “at a place called Ubol.
“My cook, who was quite capable

“Costs more than what!” you say.
A good point, so let us explain.
Take an electric fan for instance,
or a simple evaporative cooler
even a room air-conditioner. You’ll
save handsomely on everything but
results. With anything other
than properly installed whole-of-home air
conditioning, there’s a local flurry instead of
a completely regulated atmosphere clean,
de-humidified and quiet.
Chrysler designs and manufactures domestic
air conditioning in packaged units for
ducting or free discharge into any home
large or small units that are normally
installed in roof space or inconspicuous
corners outside. They are completely
automatic. Just dial the temperature you want
and enjoy it. Another good point about
Chrysler by the way they make fine cars too.
Perhaps you drive one.

SHARI LEWIS is a fine example of
the American gift for diversification.
If Australians, who have been the most
avid fans of her television show, go
along to see a puppeteer performing
at Chequers nightclub in Sydney, they
are in for several surprises. She is
dancer, singer, juggler, comedienne,
serious actress, magician, ventriloquist,
origami expert (that Japanese art of
folding paper), author of several series
of best-selling books for children, a
keen marine biologist, and collector of
primitive art — she buys for the New
York Museum. Oh, yes, and puppeteer.
Is all the variety just for spice? Not
at all, she told The Bulletin. “My
father believed in exposing me to every-
thing before I specialised. As a child I
learned several musical instruments and
dancing. I saw myself dancing with
Fred Astaire. Now in my cabaret act I
do with a dummy of him. Dancing is
still my delight.”
Is this making fantasy come true the
core of all her pursuits? She felt that
whimsy or fantasy did explain most
of her interests, none more so than
marine biology. Her skills as a puppet-
eer were wholly natural. They were
discovered accidentally after a broken
leg at the age of 17 interrupted her
dancing career. Her father gave her- a
book on puppets and magic. She found
that she could throw her voice. “Ven-
triloquism is something I just do. I
don’t understand how I do it and I
never practise. Some people open their
mouths and sing correctly and beauti-
fully. _ .
“I made all kinds of puppets. I
remember a spaceman. I did not cal-
culate how to create a good character.
Some just came to life. Those I had
to squeeze into life I usually dropped.
I never made marionettes. I hate them.
They are too far removed from the
psyche to be true alter egos. A puppet’s
function is not that of a gorgeous,
symbolic doll, but as an outlet for the
performer’s neuroses and fantasies.
There should be no mechanics between
puppeteer and puppet. No primitive
people work marionettes. A puppet
must be able to ache for the puppeteer.”
That quality is in her most famous
finger-puppet, Lamb Chop, who is still
part of her act. “Lamb Chop was
created in 1957. I’m as schizophrenic
of dealing with insects and reptiles, was
terrified of ghosts. He came dashing
downstairs one night shaking with
fright. He said, ‘Mem, I’m scared!’ I
asked him, ‘What’s the matter?’ He
could only say, ‘Upstairs!’ Well, we all
went upstairs, one at a time, armed
with everything we could lay our hands
on. We crept up to the landing. The
cook pointed tremblingly to a cup-
board. We plucked up our courage and
somehow brought ourselves to throw it
open. And do you know what we saw?
That awful bust of Edgar Allan Poe I
won as the Mystery Writers of
America’s first annual award!”

as anybody else. The gentle, naive,
innocent, and vulnerable side is in
Lamb Chop.” The other side? “I’m a
woman Lamb Chop is a child.”
What about doing a puppet show for
adults? “I do. Come along to Chequers
and see. Though I don’t like the
implications of childishness in ‘puppet
show.’ My puppets are not as anyone
has seen before. One is me’. It grows
from a baby to two, to 12, to 16, up to
me. Experiments with puppets are only
limited by one’s imagination. Some of
my acts took a year each to develop.
“The art of the puppeteer,” she
said thoughtfully, “is the belief that
you communicate. The best puppets are
seldom the most beautiful. Tilstrim’s
puppets are crude, physically, but ter-
ribly gentle filaments of life vibrate
in them. The experiments of the Czechs
are interesting but don’t live. However,
technique often precedes the person
who will bring it to life. The Moscow
Theatre puppets are also technically
brilliant but not sensitive. In puppet-
eering, unlike the pierrot or ballet,
there is no form in the technical sense.
My best work is impromptu, such as
Shari Lewis ... aching puppets
Lamb Chop ad-libbing with Johnny
Carson, Danny Kaye, or Dean Martin.
“My television series was plotted, but
I was allowed a five-minute cushion at
the end for ad-libbing. My only prep-
aration is enough sleep. A performer
is like an athlete. I don’t drink and
I’m amazed at those performers who
can get away with dissipating them-
selves.” But then, they have a script to
read.
“I’m very tactile,” she said while
she got ready to go off shopping for
kangaroo coats with her husband, a
publisher. “I don’t respond to paint-
ing, but I do to sculpture or archi-
tecture Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd
Wright, Sydney’s Victoria Street. I
hope they don’t ever pull down those
marvellous old buildings.” And out she
danced, just like on television.


ASTHMA
BRONCHITIS
HAY FEVER
Up till now, to get relief from an attack, you used a drug of some sort; no doubt you
have been doing that for many years and you'll continue doing it if you don't use
Membrosus. You wonder what this Membrosus is? Well, it's a dry inhalant, completely
different in every way from all other treatments. There are no drugs and you don't use
it just to get relief from an attack when it comes. Instead, you inhale regularly every
morning and evening whether you have an attack or not it takes about five minutes.
What happens? You'll find the attacks will become less severe and less frequent, and
after a while no attacks at all. That can happen even though you have had the
complaint for many years and you have despaired of ever getting worthwhile relief.
Here's what one happy user says: "Yesterday I got up without coughing the first time
for fourteen years. Four months ago it took me an average of 35 minutes to walk from
the station to my work . . . not a great distance either, and I was always knocked up
and short of breath. Someone told me about Membrosus, the QRY INHALANT TREATMENT.
I tried it as I have tried a dozen other things, hoping for relief. Imagine my surprise and
intense joy when, after a short period, I felt a definite relief. And when the other morning
I got up without coughing for the first time in fourteen years, I began to look at life
anew. Now I walk to my job comfortably in seven minutes, smoking my pipe and suffer
no discomfort. Now there is no coughing, no tight bound-up feeling. I am able to lie
down and sleep at night without the nightmare of an attack and enjoy meals without any
ill-effects".
Actual unsolicited testimonial letters may be sighted at our office. Enquiries are welcomed.

CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

Reliable cars and
not-so-re liable
customers
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THERE’S the 1911 Bedelia Cycle Car
that Mark Foy’s granddaughter pro-
pelled from Mount Victoria to Sydney,,
her bottom cradled in its cane chair,
feet skimming the ground, stones
ricocheting in all directions, begging
her passenger to lean out and change
gear. “Now I wonder how he did that?”
muses Elsie Bronk, prodding the cata-
pult contraption that had to move from
one groove to another to change speed.
What did he use? A stick? A hook? His
fingers? Surely not.
It’s imponderables like this that still
intrigue Elsie, who, with her 36-year-old
Dutch husband, Ben, owns and runs
Bronk’s Car Museum up at historical
Watson’s Bay, which yesterday now,
yesterday teemed with people examin-
ing their glorious vintage and veteran
collection, and today is suffering a lull.
It’s women, says Ben morosely, staring
at a little group of people staring back
at him through the window, women
who put the brake on things. Go on,
they say to their husbands, you go in,
we’ll wait outside. Then no one comes.
Or they’ll stand at the bottom of the
stairs while the men rush around in-
stead of taking their time. On second
thoughts, it’s because they have to pay
thirty cents to come in, ho ho ho!
Ben Bronk is in philosophical mood
today. He has had some battles over
licensing, which he appears to have
won; that is, last Monday he had a
letter from Them saying he didn’t need
one at all. The next thing is to get
people to his museum in droves. Some-
thing around the 1000 a week mark
would suit nicely instead of the present
200. To this end he has had some
pamphlets printed extolling not only
the virtues of his museum but also
those of Watson’s Bay, which he would
like to see built up as a tourist attrac-
tion. What happens? The Tourist
Bureau in Martin Place say they’ll dis-
play them, then they hide them under
the counter. Ah, well. So he says to a
lady at Vaucluse House, you display
some of my leaflets and I’ll display
yours. With pleasure, you can have
mine, she says, but we can’t possibly
have yours. You are commercial. Ho!
ho! ho! No, says Elsie, shocked at the
idea, she is not tempted to send inquiries

for Vaucluse House to the Gap, she
likes to help wherever possible.
Anyway, here they are: Elsie dusting
the souvenirs, including brass horns
from Japan which go down well with
females of the football fraternity,
though the noise they make it’s a
wonder they’re not thrown off the
ground; Ben shouting for Heaven’s sake
shut up to their parrot, he’s been mak-
ing a din all morning; and Tammy
their dog agitating for a game of throw.
Tammy petrified a woman the other
day. She thought he was going to bite.
What a notion. And up the stairs, past
a 1900 buggy and down into what was
once the back row of the old Village
Theatre cinema and here in splendid
profusion are twenty or so immaculate,
shining cars, a few on loan, but most
belonging to Ben.
Elsie calls it the hobby that got the
better of him you know, like stamp
collecting, except you can’t stick cars
in books. Ah yes, she says, they were
perfectly happy in their Kensington
home, Ben in fish and chips and doing
nicely, and outside in their large back-
yard one vintage car. Then he gets an-
other. Then he adds on an extension
to house more. Then an 18ft. exten-
sion on to that extension. Then a 43ft.
extension on to that. Well, there they
are, surrounded by cars. We either sell
’em, says Ben, or find somewhere big-
ger. And that’s how, two years ago, they
came by 5000 square feet of derelict
cinema, representing some $lOO,OOO
with the cars.
They get all sorts in. The car cranks
who make Ben reel. Enthusiasts are
one thing, bores another. Some days he
is quite dizzy listening to their chatter.
Then there are overseas visitors who
think because they’re Australian they’re
ignorant. Go on, said one man to Elsie,
write Belgrade, gosh she can, and. gave
her his car-plate for her trouble. They
get people who take the Don’t Touch
notices, and once someone stole a petrol
cap from a car on loan. It’s a bit awk-
ward, really, it belongs to the father
of Bruce, who is here today polishing
the brasswork, listening with a bit of a
grin to Elsie’s commentary. He thinks
women don’t know anything about cars,
but over the years Elsie’s become an
authority. She’s got her favorites: a
1912 T. Model Ford, with its mother-
in-law’s seat isolated above the back
axle, and the Bulldog that goes like
Jackie driving in the mountains. Oh
yes, they all go. They often take the
1930 Packard out. It’s getting it back
into the museum that’s the trouble.
Well, it takes nearly a day.
All the same, while Ben is down-
stairs admiring his bunting and flags,
$2O worth it’s ridiculous, and Tammy’s
going crazy for a throw, Elsie says
sotto voce, what’s really her pride and
joy, she wishes she could keep it for
herself, is the Polyphone built in 1880,
forerunner of the Nickelodeon. She
puts a penny in and out come airs from
Carmen.
Have you ever, asks Elsie raptur-
ously, seen anything, like< it?

Will Wentworth come in
out of the cold?
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
A BRITISH Prime Minister (I think
it was Gladstone, but I cannot immedi-
ately locate the quotation) said that
an effective Prime Minister must be a
butcher by trade.
He was referring to the necessity for
the Prime Minister periodically to go
through his Ministry selecting the dis-
posable beasts, slaughtering them, and
then disposing of their dismembered
bodies in a fashion profitable to him-
self in terms of electoral appeal and
to his Government from the standpoint
of administrative efficiency.
The new Australian Prime Minister,
Senator John Gorton, who has a hard
political mind and a realistic lack of
appreciation of the talents of some of
his more ineffectual Ministers, would
undoubtedly like to wander around his
Ministerial paddock, using a poleaxe
extensively on the least promising of
his political stock.
But his capacity to do this has to be
fitted into the perspective of the Aus-
tralian environment.
Characters like myself, whose job is
to comment on politics loftily, say that
State considerations should not arise
when a Ministry is being selected.
But let the number of Victorians in
the Ministry be significantly in excess
of the number of New South Welsh-
men (and though as a New South
Welshman I admit there are Victorians
with talent), then I immediately turn
round irrationally and, in common with
my fellow New South Welshmen,
irritably ask why.
The fact of life in Australian poli-
tics is that State feelings still exist and
cannot be transformed into a com-
pletely national outlook overnight.
The sensible politician recognises
this, tries patiently to change this state
of affairs, but acknowledges that the
process of change will take a long
time, and deals with his problem as it
exists rather than as he would prefer
it to be.
Gorton has now decided that he will
not make Ministry changes until after
he is elected to the House of Repre-
sentatives at (he hopes) the Higgins
by-election on February 24.
In my view this is both the proper
and sensible thing to do. Gorton cannot
regard himself as immovably planted
in the Prime Ministerial saddle until
he has won Higgins. It is most unlikely
that he will not win it. Higgins is a
beautiful non-Labor seat. But the
unlikely has happened before. Stanley
Melbourne Bruce was defeated, as
Prime Minister, in Flinders in 1929.
And Flinders was then almost as good
a non-Labor seat as Higgins is nowa-
days.
The delay gives Gorton a chance to
think around his Ministerial problems.
He can make decisions after reflection
instead of in the often misguided flush
of enthusiasm that follows on sudden
promotion. And nothing could be more
sudden—or unexpected—than Gorton’s
promotion.
But for Holt’s tragic disappearance
into the sea off Cheviot Beach a month
ago, Gorton, a relatively minor figure
in politics, and the Administration, had
nothing to look forward to except serv-
ing out his years as Government Leader
in the relative obscurity of the Senate.
As for Gorton’s Cabinet changes, my
forecast is that they will be as exten-
sive as he can manage but not as
extensive as he would wish.
I make only one forecast. I think
that after just under 20 years of rest-
lessness, frustration, and nailbiting (dur-
ing which he has nevertheless got
together some useful achievements like
pushing through the standard gauge
railway line between Sydney and Mel-
bourne) William Charles Wentworth,
the Liberal backbencher from Sydney,
who in some ways is the Parliament’s
closest approach to a genius, will at long
last enter the Ministry.
Gorton has for some time held the
same view as I have had, which is that,
if Wentworth’s incredible energy, bold-
ness in thought and ideas, and un-
matched capacity for concentration
upon a problem could be channelled
toward specific tasks and into produc-
tive directions, the benefits that would
flow to Australia would be enormous.
Gorton, who is both imaginative and
without false modesty, believes (or at
least believed before he was raised to
his present eminence) that he had the
capacity to act as a restraint and check
upon some of Wentworth’s more high-
flown ideas.
From here until after the Higgins
by-election Ministers will be on their
toes. They need to be, anyway. The
days ahead are not going to be easy
for the Gorton Government. Almost
symbolically at his first Cabinet, Gor-
ton had agenda items on two matters
which are going to continue to give
headaches to his infant Government
Britain’s speeded-up withdrawal from
South-East Asia, and redistribution of
Commonwealth electorates, that touchy
subject which has strained Liberal-
Country Party relationships in the
Coalition badly, and which gave the
former Liberal Prime Ministers, Sir
Robert Menzies and the late Mr. Har-
old Holt, many troubled hours.
Some more blows for the
balance of payments
COMMENT
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
THERE SEEMS EVERY prospect that
Britain may have some more bad
economic news for us; judging by the
activity of some British investors who
were rushing into the Australian min-
ing market last week (and by the very
heavy trading in gold in London), the
U.K. Government seems to have very
little alternative but to follow the U.S.
lead and change its “voluntary”
restraints on movements of capital over-
seas by British residents into statutory
restrictions. This would have a definite
impact on the inflow of British capital
to Australia, which has been very high
indeed in recent times even since
the sterling devaluation removed one
immediately speculative reason for
sending cash to Australia.
Even though British banks have
exerted heavy pressure on their cus-
tomers to keep their cash at home in
Britain’s best interests, the outflow from
sterling seems to have continued as
(in the words of an Australian Treasury
official) “some mavericks are thumbing
their noses at the voluntary restraints.”
In some areas of activity, British
officials seem to have been prepared to
accept the view that British funds
should continue to flow out because of
the high returns expected to be earned
on them.
gut statutory restrictions would
c i ear i y have some i mpact in Australian
stock exchanges, where stockbrokers say
that much of the momentum of the
minerals and oil share boomlet of the
past week or so seems to have come
f rom Britain (although the Reserve
Bank says it sees no evidence of any
i arge flow of British funds for this
purpose). Yet there is no reason to
get too glum about the effect on the
stockmarket of statutory restrictions,
f or it is unlikely that these would be
followed by any selling from Britain,
simply a reduction in buying. The only
difficulties that could emerge would be
in “rights” markets for the numerous
new share issues that are being made
this year, as many British investors
would be prevented from subscribing
an d WO uld therefore have to sell their
rights. And there is certainly no need
to become too gloomy about Australia’s
economic prospects for this year simply
because of the dreary news, particularly

that affecting our overseas trade and
balance of payments, that has come out
in the first fortnight or so of 1968.
Not that everything is coming up
roses, either. Even without the added
burden of the tough British and Ameri-
can measures aimed at preserving their
overseas reserves, things would prob-
ably have been more difficult for Aus-
tralia anyway, with a balance of pay-
ments deficit already assured, with the
drought still there, and with the pros-
pect of money getting in shorter supply
in the economy. Now our balance of
payments prospects (already damaged
by the drought’s effect on primary ex-
ports and low prices at a time when
our new mineral exports are still only
a fraction of what they will amount tq
in a few years) are clearly worse as
the methods being used to help the
dollar and sterling out of their con-
tinuing problem are not only affecting
our own inflow of capital, but are also
restricting the growth of world trade.
Apart from the already well recog-
nised difficulties we face with some
exports to Britain and New Zealand
following sterling’s November devalua-
tion, the only immediate foreign trading
problem we have at this stage seems to
be in the likely deduction in the rate
of growth of the Japanese economy
this year.
Until the Americans knocked their
foreign investment so firmly on the
head, there seemed every prospect that
the world’s industrial countries (to
which the bulk of our exports go)
would more than double 1967’s two
percent economic growth rate in 1968.
Now the forecast of a 4£ percent
growth rate by the “Economist” only
three weeks ago (and of seven percent
in world trade up two percent
by the OECD) has been made a
little uncertain by the measures taken
to preserve confidence in the dollar as
a world trading currency. For, when
making its forecast, the “Economist”
had the bad luck to assure its readers
that “no really frightening steps will
be taken to restrict either imports into
America or American investment
abroad ; it took two days to prove
the “Economist” wrong, and as a result
(in its own words) its “forecasts could
go seriously wrong in their turn.”
But the trend should still be toward
some fairly evenly spread improvement
in economic growth in 1968, although
countries like Japan and Italy that
went ahead so fast in 1967 are likely
to slacken off, while those that lagged
behind in 1967, like Britain and Ger-
many, may catch up, although it is
going to be harder for them. For
Britain, for example, it is going to be
more difficult to increase its overseas
earnings in a world in which there
could be a large growth in Japanese
exports, a big new export drive from
the U.S., and some balance of payments
problems in Europe. And Britain is
still an important customer of ours;
with the Japanese economy likely to
slow down a little (see page 33), the
economic health of Britain is going to
be quite important to us this year.


AUSTRALIA
The last shift in an exercise
in shiftiness
“I THINK THAT we must at last be
down to bedrock in our defence plan-
ning. We can now get on with the
job of working out our next three-year
defence plan. Every time we got going
last year, we got notice of new
acceleration of the British withdrawal
and had to start from scratch again.”
So spoke a senior Defence man last
week as Mr. George Thomson, Wilson’s
envoy, flew in to announce what must
be nearly the last shift in an incredible
exercise in shiftiness.
Cabinet Ministers at last now accept
as an accomplished fact that Great
Britain has been transformed into Little
England, a power only in Europe.
Two British utterances were being
quoted extensively around the corridors
of Parliament House last week as evi-
dence of British insularity and the
cuckoo-land -view which its leaders are
developing about the world outside
Europe.
Denis Healey, previously regarded as
one of our few allies against the re-
trenchers in the British Government,
was quoted as saying: “There is no
doubt that the danger of war in South-
East Asia at the moment is very low.”
It is pointed out that this is the
complete reverse of what Mr. Stewart
and himself were saying only eight or
ten months ago. They proclaimed then
that South-East Asia was for the fore-
seeable future the principal area of
global instability.
Australian Ministers spoke incredu-
lously of Mr. Healey’s new strategic
view. “Has he got South-East Asia
mixed up in his mind with the South
Pacific or South Australia or what?”
said one.
And, in addition, there was the gay
George Brown talking about SEATO:
“I am a great believer in alliances as
the basis of peace . . . there is no
chance whatever of Britain pulling out
of SEATO. I promise faithfully that
we will not pull out of any of our
alliances, but providing forces for them
is another matter.”
In June last year the Australian
Government hoped that Britain, using
heavy air transports, might be able to
continue to fulfil SEATO commit-
ments, even with token forces. The
abandonment of the staging base at
Aldabra almost put paid to that idea,
except that the British muttered about
sending their planes westabout through
the U.S. Last week, however, Healey,
Prime Minister Gorton and Britain’s
George Thomson (right)
in a Press interview, cleared the last
illusions by declaring that Britain
would in future buy weapons systems
“which justify themselves in Europe
alone.” Which is taken to mean that
the British Services will gear themselves
for the plains of Western Europe and
abandon the capacity for jungle war-
fare. Presumably, from now on they
will cease training for jungle tactics
and their equipment will not be made
to withstand tropical rigors.
It was a belief in the utter inevi-
tability of a complete British with-
drawal which influenced Prime Minis-
ter Gorton against acceding to Mr.
Lee Kuan Yew’s request to join him
in his delegation of protest in London.
Gorton could have gone as a gesture
of regional solidarity with a popular
and highly respected Asian ally, and
gone there pleading not for Australia
but for Singapore. But the cautious
among his colleagues and advisers pre-
vailed.
Any attempt to appeal to the British
over the head of their Government
would be a breach of protocol they
said. So would a visit without an
invitation. In addition, Mr. Lee would
be able to establish, by Gorton’s pres-
ence with him, Australia’s special
responsibility for Singapore’s future.
And the conservatives wouldn’t want
anything like that to happen not
until it had been given the proper
consideration.
Perhaps the more sensible reasons
advanced to him for letting Lee go
alone were first that that way he might
operate more effectively on his fellow
socialists in the British Labor Party.
Furthermore, it was said that the most
that could be achieved would be small
additional financial assistance to help
Singapore cope with the economic dis-
locations of the accelerated withdrawal.
The basic trouble is that Gorton, like
the rest of the Government, is unde-
cided about the importance of the
Singapore - Malaysia relationship and
the extent to which we should get in-
volved in their future. As long as this
indecision persists there will be a
wary, cautious approach to proposals
for closer collaboration. Of all the
many thousands of telegrams of con-
gratulation of his election to the Prime
Minister, no doubt Mr. Gorton pon-
dered most deeply Lee Kuan Yew’s:
“Congratulations on your election to
leadership. May the links between us
grow strong with you as Prime Minis-
ter. May our common interests be fur-
thered by closer co-operation.”
One of the big debates within the
Cabinet is going to be over the size
of Australia’s role in South-East Asia.
Several Ministers believe that Austra-
lia’s role should grow. They reject the
Treasurer McMahon seating the British at the Canberra conference


idea of any rigid arithmetical limits on
the resources to be devoted to defence
and foreign aid. There is increasing
opposition to the Treasurer, Mr. Mc-
Mahon, for apparently trying to cir-
cumscribe the forthcoming defence re-
view with statements about the need
to keep defence spending below five
percent of GNP. One of his colleagues
told our Canberra man this week: “I
am dead against any rigid ceiling of
that sort. We have to assess the various
threats and opportunities to use military
power constructively in the region.
Then we have to weigh it against the
other demands of the economy and
the Budget, and see where we land
up. There is nothing magic in a per-
centage of GNP.”
Task Force
Staying at Nui Dat
LAST WEEK SAW several cable
reports about the desire of American
commanders to have Australian troops
In Vietnam shifted. One had it that
Commander-in-Chief General West-
moreland wanted two battalions of
Diggers transferred out of Phuoc Tuy
province, where they are now based, to
Chu Lai in the southern part of I Corps.
It was reported he wanted them to join
the “American Division”, a newly
formed “super division” of some 24,000
men from several separate units.
General Westmoreland’s suggestion
of a shift is not new. Visiting the Task
Force at Nui Dat as far back as 15
months ago he said casually to our
Commanding Officer that “Aussie
troops are so - good, we really should be
making better use of them.” On another
visit two months later he spoke more
specifically.
He inquired of our military men
whether they would object to being
moved to the DMZ. They reacted
strongly, saying they disagreed with
Marine tactics up there, that they would
be most reluctant to take their men
up there, and that anyway there was
still a difficult job to be done in Phuoc
Tuy—as far as they were concerned
it was not on.
Westmoreland left it at that. He
made no formal request through the
Australian Government, so Canberra
(officially, anyway) knows nothing
about it. Chu Lai is a good 125 miles
south of the DMZ, and the U:S. Army
are not as careless with life as the
Mai'ines. But it is unlikely General
Westmoreland will find more enthu-
siasm at Nui Dat for his latest sugges-
tion than for his earlier ones.
An American corps commander was
also reported to have remarked that
he would like some Australians to help
in the Mekong Delta. If our troops
Army Minister Fraser... no review
had the necessary helicopter support
they could possibly assist in occasional
strike missions into the Delta, while
still maintaining their area of tactical
reponsibility in Phuoc Tuy province,
'the eastern part of the Delta is within
easy flying distance of Nui Dat. But
this would be dependent on a further
spectacular weakening of the Viet Cong
in II Corps, for the present plans have
been for the Australians to be used
farther east and north into II Corps
rather than west into the Delta’s IV
Corps.
Army Minister Fraser, interviewed
in his office in Canberra last week, told
us he thought the reports were prob-
ably based on general expressions of
desire to have more Australian troops.
“If a request did reach us we would
certainly look at it closely, but no
request has come to the Army or any
member of the Government. The sub-
ject was not mentioned on my most
recent trip to Vietnam or when other
senior officers have been there more
recently. Headquarters in Vietnam have
not reported any approach to them.
“It is quite possible that we will be
undertaking operations at a greater
distance from Nui Dat, but we will
still, under present arrangements, keep
Nui Dat as the Task Force PIQ. The
Third Battalion will enable us to reach
out farther in our own right but we
would also be taking part in combined
operations with the U.S. and S.V.N.
forces.
“The Army and the Government
would oppose fragmentation of the
Task Force. I am sure we would much
prefer to keep it together as one viable
force rather than have parts of it
grafted on to other larger units. This
is much more satisfactory from an Aus-
tralian military point of view and it
is also more satisfactory from a national
point of view.”
He added: “If we were moved out
of the province and other forces took
our place, the continuity of our
program would still be interrupted. We
have the trust of the officials and the
people in the area. In view of all these
overriding considerations it would not
make sense to interrupt the progress
that our presence is making possible.”
Before agreeing to a shift he would
have to be given a very solid argument
why they were needed elsewhere. “They
are doing a good job in Phuoc Tuy
but there is still much more to do. If
they were shifted out now, someone
else would have to come in, or else
all our efforts would have been in
vain.”
Safflower industry
Seedy prospects
AT THE MOMENT the dairying-
margarine row is dormant, over-
shadowed by the effects of sterling
devaluation on the butter industry. In
this period of lull, two recent develop-
ments in the oilseeds industry make
interesting reading.
In 1966 and early last year, when the
butter-margarine debate was at its
height, the margarine interests made
great play of the growth they were
supposedly inducing in local oilseeds
production. In their famous Mrs. Jones
propaganda, Marrickville said it had
c/eated “a great new primary industry.”
Excellently laid out full-page advertise-
ments brought the public the message
that a “small yellow flower, not unlike
a thistle, is creating a quiet revolution
. . The safflower was introduced in
dramatic photographs. Sharply rising
graphs demonstrated how “a dynamic
new primary industry was born.” It
was dependent for its continued pros-
perity on the abandonment of mar-
garine quotas.
With Marrickville promising to buy
only Australian oils for its margarine,
it joined with a major oilseed miller
and contract purchaser, Pacific
Safflower, in a big publicity campaign
against the quotas.
The Bulletin pointed out at the time
that in their publicity these companies
were making some very dubious claims
about the importance of quotas to the
producers of oilseeds.
For cotton-growers the sale of fibre
would always determine the economics
of production. The sale of cottonseed
for oil was only a marginal source of
revenue and so the market for oil was
not of importance to cotton-growers.
The same was true of peanuts. It
would never pay peanut-growers to pro-
duce for crushing for oil. Their staple
market would always have to be to
supply peanuts as food in cellophane
packets. The sale of peanuts for oil-
crushing would never be more than a
way of cutting losses on a few spoiled
or broken nuts.
Only the safflower industry was
directly dependent on margarine manu-
facturers.
Anyway, the advertisements told us
there was an “explosive growth” of saf-
flower farming, and a tremendous future
in store for this dramatic thistle. Pacific
Safflower was quoted as having plans to
expand the acreage from 80,000 to
150,000 and 250,000 in a short span


of years. Only the quotas put this
expansion in jeopardy.
Recent developments have confirmed
the view that the margarine campaign
was based on quite false propositions.
The first was the proposition that
safflower production was a sound indus-
try, not needing more than average
protection. It was portrayed as an
industry which, unlike dairying, could
stand on its own feet. The management
consultants firm of W. D. Scott was
quoted in a survey it prepared for
Marrickville in February, 1967, as con-
cluding that the local industry could
claim to be efficient and that it “does
not demand undue protection to per-
mit growth in production.”
This has turned out to be almost the
complete opposite of the truth.
Just before Christmas the special
advisory authority heard an urgent
appeal from the safflower growers for
protection in excess of the 30 percent
they were already receiving.
They asked for a sliding-scale form
of tariff protection, the sort of variable
.duty which provides maximum pro-
tection. And they got it. They now
have the sort of open-ended tariff pro-
tection which the European Common
Market countries apply to protect their
inefficient peasant farmers. At current
prices it appears that Australian saf-
flower growers, far from being the
efficient modern industry of the mar-
garine propaganda campaign, are shel-
tering behind a tariff wall of about
60 or 70 percent and there is no limit
to the height of the wall given the
sliding-scale or support-price system in
force. Since most calculations of the
protection given dairy farmers arrive
at a figure of around 40 percent, the
tables have been turned. Safflower is
the more propped-up subsidised indus-
try.
A second point in the propaganda
campaign was that there was a threat
of an imminent glut of safflower oil.
Again W. D. Scott was brought into
the PR offensive, predicting a big over-
supply unless quotas on table mar-
garine were lifted. This, too, has been
proved quite false.
There has been no over-supply. On
the contrary, imports have continued
at a high rate despite the tariff barriers.
Local production has got nowhere
near local demand, even though that
demand remains curbed to some extent
by quotas on the sale of table mar-
garine. In 1966-67 imports were 5200
tons against a production of 8000 tons.
Despite the sliding-scale tariff, local
production continues to run far short of
local needs. This year’s crop is esti-
mated at round 6000 tons, assuming a
local market this year of 13,000 tons,
this amounts to a shortfall of 7000 tons.
The “glut” so often spoken of in
the margarine propaganda has not
eventuated and the “explosive growth”
has, despite increased tariff protection
of the most generous kind, failed to be
achieved.
Finally, it appears that the local
oilseeds producers are being dumped
by the margarine manufacturers. With
the local producers failing to deliver
the goods in the form of the safflower
oil needed, imports are rising steeply.
In the July-October quarter they were
running at a rate close to 10,000 tons
a year. Evidently now the margarine
manufacturers are applying to the
Government to get duty-free imports
of safflower oilseed to the extent of
18,000 tons. This will crush into about
6000 tons of oil, almost the equal of
local output.
Which all goes to show what a lot
of baloney the PR men can dream up,
when asked to do so. It would send
Mrs. Jones back to the cows.
Country Party
Queensland style
WHEN GEORGE Francis Nicklin
applied the final crunch to Queensland
Labor Premier Gair’s downfall in mid-
-1957, he had been Opposition Leader
for 16 years and had 16 Country Party
supporters and eight Liberals to face 49
Labor members. But a few months
later, in the' election which followed
Gair’s expulsion from the pro-Evatt
ALP, Frank Nicklin emerged as
Premier with 24 Country Party and 18
Liberal supporters, against the ALP’s
20 or so and Gair’s 11 QLP. He was
then 61 years old and not expected to
remain in office very long: he was “a
farmer who demands only that every-
thing be fair dinkum,” and one of his
friends commented, “Frank plays the
game too fairly to win in the company
he’s in.”
But he has remained, through three
subsequent elections, and perhaps too
long according to “ginger group”
members of the Liberal side of his
Coalition (which has gradually
increased its proportion from the one-
third of a minority before 1957 to 20 in
47 at the 1966 election). In a recent
Coalition tiff in Parliament a resigning
Liberal described the Government
under Country Party leadership as “an
agrarian dictatorship.” The five three-
cornered contests at the last election
were an overt bid for a probably
New Premier Pizzey ... cane
inevitable Liberal majority and the
Premiership; but that move failed in its
objective. Queensland preferred to
continue under Frank Nicklin, the six-
foot, World War I Digger, former pine-
apple grower, country show judge, Surf
Life Saving'Association life-member, a
man known personally throughout the
State, and whose charisma suits
Queensland.
In the Sunshine State, dependable
progress is preferred to rapid expansion
and quickly mounting problems. After
all, it is hot most of the year. In
other similarly hot countries they take
long siestas; Queenslanders work on at
a sensible pace. Frank Nicklin has been
able to say, after his 10 years in office,
that Queensland is doing well —pointing
to the alumina plant at Gladstone, the
Moura coal being shipped to Japan, a
Moonie natural gas pipeline headed
toward Brisbane, the power network
expanding, more and better roads, all-
diesel railways, the Army base at
Townsville, \\ million acres of new land
being cleared for settlement —all within
the span of his Government.
Most of all, he has maintained Aus-
tralia’s only Country Party-Liberal
Coalition intact, through a time when
his Party has been declining in influ-
ence elsewhere. Nowhere is non-Labor
as firmly entrenched as in the State
which voted overwhelmingly Labor for
25 years before Nicklin became
Premier, and in this sense alone he has
been an admirable politician. In the
tradition, he hands over this week to
his colleague and long-time friend
J. C. A. Pizzey, 56, a former adult edu-
cation officer and cane farmer, and the
only other survivor of the 1957 Govern-
ment still in Parliament, who has two
years to consolidate before the next
State election, the vital one for the
CP in Queensland.
Pizzey’s main problems are a mild
public feeling that his Party is, in terms
once applied to Nicklin, “anachronistic,
negative, and slightly depressing”; and
the Liberals’ statement last week that
“Queensland will inevitably have a
Liberal Premier it is only a matter
of time.” As a possible step in that
direction, the by-election for Mr. Nick-
lin’s vacated seat in the Landsborough
electorate will be a three-cornered con-
test.

ALP
Pilgrims
THE VICTORIAN ALP sometimes
gives the appearance of being more of
a sect than a political party. As is the
way with sects, it has small numbers
(half as many as the DLP and less than
a third of the Liberals), a rigid set of
orthodox beliefs, leaders who are not
measured in vulgar terms of worldly
success, and a projection of holy lands
and shrines.
Russia, because of its spiritual flabbi-
ness, and China, because of its unseemly
internal upsets, have lost some favor
with Victorian Labor pilgrims lately.
The new centres of edification are East
Germany and Cambodia. State secre-
tary Mr. Bill Hartley will this year
follow in the path of other Labor
leaders to East Germany. Last week
Dr. Jim Cairns, Mrs. Clyde Holding,
wife of the State Opposition Leader,
and Victorian ALP executive member
Mr. Colin Pratt led a delegation of 25
to the land of elephants and Prince
Sihanouk.
The build-up for Cambodia has been
proceeding for some time. Especially
since Indonesia took a reactionary turn
by putting down its revolt of national
liberation, and Lee Kuan Yew disgraces
Singapore and socialism by telling the
Yanks they should have enough guts to
stay in South-East Asia.
In a recent statement authorised by
secretary Hartley, the Victorian ALP
declared: “Cambodia is a country Labor
admires.” The statement went on: “It
has been gravely and quite unjustifiably
injured by the Vietnam War taking
place as it does in adjoining territory.
Its borders have been violated by the
despicable Thieu-Ky regime of South
Vietnam.
“Cambodia has foreign policy objec-
tives which we in the Australian Labor
Party fully support. It is a model for
those who reject the ‘Big Powers’
policies of East and West which have
led to a long p'eriod of damaging and
fruitless cold war since the end of
World War II.”
As he was leaving last week, Dr.
Cairns said that he wanted to see what
the attitudes of the National Liberation
Front and the North Vietnamese
leaders were to conferences. He added:
“I feel that Cambodia is a good place
for this.”
Cambodia may or may not be such a
place, but it is the best place for
authorised Australian travellers to meet
Mr. Wilfred Burchett, the Australian
Communist who works for the Commu-
nist Party of North Vietnam (some of
the more genteel overseas papers prefer
to call him “the Australian Left-wing
writer with good contacts, in the Viet
Cong”). Burchett uses Cambodia as his
propaganda headquarters for relaying
North Vietnamese propaganda and,
perhaps, messages to the Western
world.
If Dr. Cairns and his party get
beyond the Burchett barrier, their
mission may serve a useful purpose. If
the Victorian ALP, on their return,
begins to qualify its admiration for
Sihanouk and Cambodia, the signs will
indicate that America has made some
advancement in relations and in settling
terms for border guarantees. On the
other hand, the greater the praise the
more the likelihood that Sihanouk has
taken the Victorian Labor mission and
those it represents as evidence that the
balance of forces is still precarious not
only in South-East Asia but in Western
public opinion.
The Pi'ince very recently sacked
he said they resigned - his Left-wing
Cabinet and is now making equivocal
noises about violation of his people’s
territory. If the Labor contingent can-
not bring him back on to the straight
and narrow trail, they can threaten
him with deposition from the myth-
ology of the Australian Left. But, then,
who will be left as a focus of pilgrim-
age? Harold Wilson?
Foot and Mouth
High Security
AS WITH THE higher primates
and public figures of various wave-
lengths, foot - and - mouth disease is
not necessarily fatal to beasts of the
field. However, it is severely debili-
tating, causing blisters of foot and
mouth, internal lesions, and heart
trouble. There have been no cases
recorded in Australian animals since
Federation but knowledge of its con-
sequences overseas is enough to make
the very mention of the disease send
a panic tremor through local farming
organisations.
The Victorian division of the Aus-
tralian Primary Producers’ Union said
last week that it was anxiously watch-
ing “the U.K. outbreak develop into
the worst that country had experi-
enced.” The State President of the
APPU, Mr. A. B. Wood, said that
Britain had been assisted in dealing
with the disease by having at her dis-
posal many trained veterinarians and
a co-operative farming community.
The point of the APPU’s statement
is that “these factors do not apply in
Indonesia and this area constitutes a
closer and more potent threat to Aus-
tralian livestock . . . foot-and-mouth
already exists in Indonesia and it has
been recently reported that a suspected
blue-tongue outbreak has occurred on
the island of Timor.”
The Union fears that the disease
could be carried by migratory birds
(starlings are suspected of bringing
the virus into England), by Indonesian
fishermen blown ashore in the north-
western cattle country, or by the grow-
ing numbers of aircraft and ships which
port in both countries. To serve our
mutual needs the Union suggests that
a useful form of foreign aid would be
the sending of Australian veterinarians
to Indonesia to assist in the eradication
of the disease from those islands.
Australia has a small but portable
company of vets, who could be used in
such a program. Early in December, 14
of them were flown to Britain to assist
in the recent disease crisis: three each
from Queensland and New South
Wales, two each from Victoria and
Western Australia, and one each from
Tasmania, South Australia, Northern
Territory, and Papua-New Guinea. As
well as the above group working in the
field a number of other senior veterin-
ary hygiene officials representing the
Commonwealth and States went to ob-
serve the organisation of the British
eradication program.
According to some scientists the prob-
lem with the Primary Producers’
scheme is a psychological one. Coun-
tries like Australia and Britain are
geared to a policy of complete eradica-
tion of the disease if and where it
occurs. The British authorities are con-
fident they have the present outbreak
under control and will eradicate the
disease in a matter of months. Indo-
nesia and Asian countries, on the other
hand, have been persecuted by the virus
for centuries and have learnt to live
with it.
The CSIRO claims that in any case
the risk from Indonesia is relatively
small compared with the risk contained
in the arrival of population, aircraft,
and ships from Europe. The virus can
be transferred through ship and aero-
plane garbage, mud on passengers’
shoes, or smuggled food. An outbreak
in Canada was finally traced back to
its entry in an immigrant’s pork saus-
age.
The CSIRO is in favor of the estab-
lishment of a High Security Laboratory
to study the disease, its modes of trans-
ference, and means of dealing with it
in emergencies. The plan is at present
being studied by the Commonwealth,,
and is likely to gain the backing of the
Department of Health. Scientists are
forbidden to import the virus for re-
search under present regulations, and
only a High Security Laboratory would
be permitted to bring it into the coun-
try.
Even so, there is likely to be some
resistance from farmers to the entry of
the virus. The debate tends to be circu-
lar: the veterinary scientists argue they
do not know enough about the disease
and want to study it under laboratory
conditions. Some of the farmers claim
that because we are not adequately pre-
pared to deal with serious outbreaks the
disease should be kept out at all costs.
The best results may be achieved if
farmers and scientists, like farmers and
cowboys, would be friends.


John the Bold
or Gorton
the Unready?
WHEN IT CAME to 7.30 on the night
of the commission of Senator John Gor-
ton as Prime Minister of Australia and
Australians watching their television
sets were told that their new Prime
Minister would not be giving his
promised message to the nation because
of the telephone call he had received
from Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew, those
people in Canberra who already had
their theories about what kind of a
Prime Minister Gorton would be then
settled down for the rest of the night
to discuss the significance of this inci-
dent in relation to their favorite Gorton
theories.
On the one side was the school of
thought that saw Gorton as a man who
could quickly make up his own mind;
of this school some saw him as “deci-
sive,” others as “too impulsive.” On
the other side were those who saw him
as a man who found it hard to make
up his mind; of these some saw him
as “indecisive,” and some saw him as
a man who wanted to be convinced he
was right before he made a move. In
the middle were those who saw him as
both impulsive and indecisive or a
man of action who took decision-
making seriously.
Everybody agreed that it was typical
of Gorton that he would decide at once
to give a message to the nation. Few
were surprised that, after ten minutes
of hypnotic persuasion from Lee Kuan
Yew, he had decided to ta!ke seriously
Lee’s invitation to fly almost at once
to London and stick up for Singapore
against the British. (Lee Kuan Yew is
almost as widely accepted a hero of
the new wave men in the Liberal
Party as John'F. Kennedy.) Where the
disagreement arose was as to whether
Gorton would follow his impulses with
decisive action.
In the event, he mucked it up.
Decision: Message to the nation. Deci-
sion: Don’t make a message to the
nation. Build-up: What exciting event
is our new Prime Minister about to
create? Answer (next day): None.
Here was the greatest immediate
build-up any new Prime Minister has
ever had: the extraordinary death of
his predecessor, the extraordinary
gathering of notables at his pre-
decessor’s memorial service, the extra-
ordinary human interest drama of the
contenders for the Prime Ministership,
the extraordinary television coverage of
that afternoon’s happenings in Parlia-
ment House. And then a telephone mes-
sage from Australia’s favorite Asian,
asking for the help of a brotherly hand.
By flying to London with Lee, Gorton
had nothing to lose. It would be easy
enough to avoid making a fool of him-
self, easy enough to appear a disinter-
ested partner supporting the cause of
a neighbor, easy enough if the mission
failed to come out of it with honor.
Here was a chance to establish at once
Australia’s concern with the affairs of
its neighbors and to begin building that
new and more honest relationship with
Britain that is now such an important
part of our foreign policy. Why did
he fail to take it?
The answer lies partly in the answer
to the other question they were asking
in Canberra on that same Wednesday
night last week: why hadn’t Gorton
immediately got down to creating his
new Cabinet? Where was the man of
action in a Prime Minister who
announced that he would take some
weeks before he got around to con-
sidering the kind of Cabinet he
wanted? His own explanation seemed
naive: that he shouldn’t go in for
Cabinet-forming before he was sure of
his seat in the House of Represen-
tatives. It must have been obvious that,
offset against this purely ceremonial
consideration, there was a much more
important consideration: that it is a
funny way to run a Government by
announcing that you are going to
change it, but not for a few more
weeks.
Imagine the uncertainty this now
introduces into the Government of Aus-
tralia: over these next few weeks some
Ministers will be dreaming of the new
and more important Ministries they
hope to be given; others will be resent-
fully considering their exile to the back
benches or unwanted embassies; and
all of them, if they have any political
instincts, will be lobbying like mad to
extend their power, or at least maintain
it. In this process the new Prime Min-
ister, given magical power by his easy
victory, may lose some of his power
and magic, so that he may not be as
bold in his Cabinet remaking as he
could have been if he had got down to
the job at once.
The reason why Gorton is taking
time over restructuring his Cabinet is
one that does him credit. He is con-
templating changes of a kind that have
not before been made in one go during
the whole period of Liberal administra-
tion. He is being the opposite of
impulsive. But by delay he is running
very great risks. He is a man of quick
verbal decision, but he goes on worry-
ing about whether his decision is the
right one after he has made it. The
success of his Prime Ministership will
be determined by the way in which
these two forces balance out in him.
On the one side a very real desire to
get some action; on the other a hesi-
tancy about whether the action is right.
These are not necessarily bad character-
istics. They could be the makings of
a great Prime Minister. But John
Gorton may have to achieve the
balance very quickly.
Twelve months ago, when asked if
he would like to become Prime Min-
ister, he laughed and replied that it
was almost certainly out of the
question: “I would have to climb too
many rungs of the ladder too quickly.
Age and the fact that I have come
from Victoria are against me. I would
have needed to get into the Ministry
earlier. Anyway, I have no special
ambition to be Prime Minister, though
I feel capable of handling senior
Ministerial jobs.” The very fact that,
under considerations that seemed
normal in the Menzies era, he was the
wrong man for the job was why the
Liberals picked him last week. His very
unreadiness and unpredictability were
his advantages. A tried horse seemed
almost certain to fail. They needed an
outsider. If Gorton can co-ordinate his
conflicting creative impulses of both
decision and uncertainty quick enough
he will quickly become a winner; if
he can’t he may stumble lamely into
disaster.
Time is not on his side. The acceler-
ated British pull-out from Malaysia and
Singapore means that, in effect, Aus-


tralia must redefine its national role at
the latest within the next couple of
months. If it hadn’t been Singapore’s
Lee Kuan Yew on the telephone on
Tuesday it would in any case have been
Britain’s Commonwealth Relations
Minister George Thomson on Friday,
giving details of the burial service of
British interest in South-East Asia.
The difference between Gorton’s im-
pulse on Wednesday night to consider
Lee Kuan Yew’s message seriously and
his decision on Thursday to send a
written statement to London instead of
himself or his External Affairs Minister
was the difference between a Prime
Minister as a man and a Prime Minister
caught in the bog of Cabinet advice.
The present Cabinet . is cautious,
puzzled, indecisive, and even a little
frightened by the immediate challenges
produced by the accelerated British
withdrawal. Its senior Ministers are
aging men, children of the British
Empire or the American alliance, to
whom the possibility of genuinely in-
dependent Australian action still seems
unfamiliar. The Treasury has a
foreign policy of its own which dis-
misses South-East Asia as an unimport-
ant area to which Australia does not
export much. Making a ludicrously fake
analogy with Vietnam (and in any case
drawing the wrong lesson from it), the
Cabinet as a whole is afraid that Aus-
tralian public opinion would be against
special commitments to Singapore and
Malaysia. Parts of the External Affairs
Department are concerned with reac-
tions elsewhere (particularly Indonesia)
and with a distrust of commitment be-
yond existing military strength.
Plarold Holt’s travel arrangements
and speeches carried Australia much
further toward exercising an indepen-
dent role in South-East Asia than the
present Cabinet is prepared for.
Counti'ies as far away as America and
Japan and as close as Indonesia, Singa-
pore, Malaysia, and the Philippines are
writing Australia up for an Asian role
in a way that the Australian Govern-
ment is not yet prepared for. It was
nice to have all those Asians at Harold
Holt’s memorial service and it’s pleasant
that politicians have got into the habit
of using the word “Asia” as they used
to use wwds like “free enterprise” or
“full employment.” But Australia is
about to be asked a question to which
it can reply only “yes” or “no.” Will
it enter into commitments with Singa-
pore and Malaysia? Or will it refuse?
Will it combine such a commitment —
which can be as much economic as
military and as much psychological as
strategic with increased economic
assistance to Indonesia and with a
practical interest in co-operation with
the ASEAN countries of Singapore,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia,
and Thailand? Or will it give up?
In the present lack of nerve that
marks Cabinet discussion on these
questions it is likely that only decisive-
ness from John Gorton will force the
issue. What is he likely to decide?
There are still some who distrust
him as a “Goldwaterite,” or as a for-
mer member of the old “Formosa
Lobby.” They see him as an ideologue
of narrow interest, lost with old con-
cepts. This interpretation is almost
certainly wrong. Gorton seems to
understand that the problems of South-
East Asia are more than those of mili-
tary action. He has said: “What I
would try to do in Asia as a political
objective is to see in the regions closest
to us, at any rate, that countries such
as Indonesia and Malaysia develop their
material resources and control them
for the benefit of their own peoples.
We want to see these countries attack-
ing disease and providing growing
opportunities for education and better
living conditions for their people. We
want to see them effectively expanding
and improving public utilities and pro-
viding opportunities for free discussion
and public participation in the political
and economic questions which they
must decide.”
Even more important than his words,
his actions suggest a subtlety that goes
far beyond Goldwaterism or Formosa
Lobbying. As Acting Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs, even while Australian
troops in Borneo were playing a part
in the manoeuvres of Sukarno’s con-
frontation, he supported his depart-
ment’s recommendations for continued
economic aid to Indonesia. At the time
of the West Irian dispute he spoke up
for a change of Australian policy. It
seems unlikely that his wife made a
broadcast in Indonesian to the Indo-
nesians last week without discussing it
with him. In fact, his obvious special
concern with Indonesia (including, it
is reported, several significant personal
friendships) seems a highly attractive
and useful quality, expressing a refresh-
ing bias in interest in South-East Asia
that goes beyond both Australia’s
British and American connections.
How will Gorton respond to the
challenges of the next few months?
Pessimists see as much danger as good
in his impulsiveness: they fear that he
is as likely to pull out as to stay in.
Optimists hope that he will understand
that continuing to rotate battalions
through Malaysia, if that is what the
Malaysians want, is an easy and
obvious decision and that it would not
be impossible (if the rumors of a desire
to get more out of the Defence Minis-
Interviewers outside Parliament House were willing to ask
any journalist in sight who should be the next Prime Minis-
ter. This is Jonathan Gaul of “The Canberra Times”

remotely connected with the event. This is Mrs. Leslie Bury,

teries are true) to increase our dis-
posable forces to brigade strength by
the time of the British evacuation. It
is harder to supply troops in Terendak
rather than Townsville, but not that
much harder.
Wher£ his real test might come is in
a confrontation with the Treasury, to
get out of them enough money not only
to satisfy Malaysia and Singapore but
to make a significant impact in Indo-
nesia and also to play whatever role
seems available in the ASEAN area
generally. For the moment the
Treasury dresses up its conservative
foreign policy in mathematics, using
numbers as mystic symbols of capa-
bility. For Gorton, in handling the
Treasury, there is no room for either
impulsiveness or uncertainty. The new
Prime Minister must break the
Treasury’s present role as a decision-
maker in foreign policy, but he must
do it after preparation and with strong
consistence. If he can’t get more
flexible arrangements that enable him
to draw on Australia’s economic re-
sources (comparatively immense in the
area in which we live) he won’t have
a foreign policy—beyond the foreign
policy of after-dinner speeches (for
which there will be no audience).
Australia has probably come almost to
the end of the era of merely verbal
expression of goodwill. We are now
coming to the era of put-up-or-shut-up.
Probably there is hope to be found
in Gorton’s answer to the man who
asked him if he was British to the
bootstraps or went all the way with
LBJ. Gorton’s reply was that he was
an Australian. There is now an Aus-
tralian instinct that we should keep our
regional environment friendly and safe.
If Gorton’s instincts go beyond Great
Ally thinking, if he has an Australian
reaction to Australian problems, he will
reach the right conclusions. If Gorton
can rise very quickly to a clear
definition of an independent Aus-
tralian foreign policy in the ASEAN
area and if he carries out some of the
ideas he has been putting around about
how he thinks things should be run in
Australia, it is likely that the historians
of 1984 will look back on the Christmas
holiday period of 1967 as a final turn-
ing away from the habits of Sir Robert
Menzies.
In what could seem an interregnum
period Harold Holt moved away from
Menzies as he groped toward a shift
in leadership styles and a redefinition
of Australia’s role in the world. But he
grew too long under the oak of Menzies,
and internally the Liberal Party and
Liberal Government remained much
the same. The Menzies use of Cabinet
as a way of limiting decision was re-
placed by the Holt use of Cabinet as
a way of glorifying indecision. But the
result was much the same grindingly
slow administrative process, a minimum
of innovation and strangely sad im-
provisations before elections.
Just as Gorton’s action in tabling the
VIP documents in the Senate made
him the natural candidate of those who
wanted change (some of his earliest
supporters wanted him to replace Holt
when Holt was still alive), in the same
way Sir Robert Menzies’ energetic
candidature for Mr. Paul Hasluck as
Prime Minister confirmed support for
Gorton’s candidacy. Gorton must very
quickly saddle his uncertainties to his
impetuosity to produce the new style in
government his supporters now expect.
If he does not perform the necessary
acts of magic the coalition he leads
could fall to pieces.
He is known to have a desire to
introduce an administrative style that
would be quite the opposite of that
encouraged in the Menzies and Holt
Governments. Whereas Menzies liked
to keep everything in his own grasp,
and expected his ministers and depart-
mental heads to do the same, Gorton
has indicated that he wants to delegate
responsibility down the line. As Min-
ister for Education and Science he
quickly made his way by his habit of
making his queries on memoranda
directly to the middle-level officer who
drafted it, bypassing “formal channels.”
His first recruit to a new style may be
Sir Henry Bland, the new head of the
Defence Department and therefore the
public servant with the greatest present
bundle of worries. It is believed that
Bland was encouraged by Mr. Holt to
move into the defence complex and
change it, beginning those processes of
integration that are so obviously over-
due. If this is so, Bland has a tough and
intricate job ahead of him, almost im-
possible to carry out through normal
channels. Bland’s natural method of
operation would be to undercut min-
isters and departmental heads, both in
the defence departments and in related
departments, and deal with the second
or even third levels of the departmental
hierarchies. If Gorton carries out his
declared philosophy of approach, Bland
will be given his head in the most diffi-
cult and most important single task
facing the administration.
In Canberra this week it is Gorton's
possible administrative style that most
interests high Government officials.
They tend to see his problems as those
of impetuosity or uncertainty (or both)
rather than those of decision-making
and careful consideration. Some of them
tend to dismiss him as something of
an improviser—a straight off the top of
the head man, not capable of that
sustained, intelligent consideration of
alternative courses that should precede
Another candidate, Billy Snedden, happened to find himself on the tennis
court while photographers were around, but as it turned out there was

ing political awareness. When John Gorton

action; if they see him as someone who
reads their briefs, it is as someone who
might be unnerved by them. His
immediate vacillation on the Lee Kuan
Yew flight to London is used by them
as evidence —yes, off the top of his
head; no, after considering the argu-
ments.
But it should be remembered that
for more years than Australia can be
proud of the characteristic of Canberra
government has been that of a bureau-
cratic negative caution, a concentrated
attention on the unfeasibility of doing
new things. A return to some of the
improvisations that marked the Labor
Governments of the 1940 s might now
be welcome. Australians can be
cautious and unimaginative; they can
also be reckless improvisers. A swing
from one danger to the other has been
long overdue. However, if Gorton
really wants to set up a decision-making
style in Government some of the greatest
impediments to its success may lie in
his fellow ministers rather than in high
officials. Out in the departments they
congratulate themselves on their “pro-
fessionalism,” but some of them are a
bit bored with it. They might prefer
excitement for a change. How many
of Gorton’s ministers could sustain that
sense of excitement?
Whether for this reason, or for some
other, Gorton was talking before he
became Prime Minister of the need to
give himself a personal staff, on the
American model, of half a dozen or so
ideas men. So far as is known, he
intends to carry this out. As in other
ways, this gives one a pang of memory
of the good intentions of Harold Holt,
who had also always intended to do
this but, as in other matters, did not
quite know how to carry it out. It is
obviously urgent that a Prime Minister
should have a kind of other brain that
can remain switched on to general
policy considerations while the Prime
Minister’s brain is concerned with the
pressing trivialities of office and that he
should also use the more formal
apparatus provided by the Prime
Minister’s Department to do some of
his predigesting for him. Whether he
proceeds in this way, and how quickly,
will be early tests of Gorton’s approach
to office.
Another early test will be whether
Gorton carries into action his pre-Prime
Minister conversation about the need
for cost effectiveness studies as a guide
to decision-making. He has talked about
the need, for instance, to gear develop-
ment moneys to a program of projects
ranked in order of their national profit-
ability. These, of course, are not just
matters of intelligent planning but of
the horse-trading of politics. Politicians
tend to see dams as having more votes
than extension services, management
courses, and practical research. But
there are cost-effectiveness considera-
tions even in deciding what you chuck
into the pork barrel. If the money
that was hastily thrown into the Ord
Scheme as a vote-catcher before last
year’s Senate elections had been
promised instead as the beginning of a
genuine restructuring program for the
dairying industry it might have got
more votes as well as being more in the
national interest.
One matter on which John the Bold
is immediately likely to give way to
Gorton the Unready is the question
of Commonwealth-State relations. It
seems almost beyond belief that Gorton
the Prime Minister will try to carry
out the policies of Gorton the Central-
ist. His reputation in Victoria as a
“Canberra man” and Sir Henry
Bolte’s opposition to him robbed him
of the extra few votes that would have
won him the Prime Ministership on
a spectacular first vote last week.
Commonwealth-State relations are one
of the most important intractabilities
of Australian politics. (One of the
reasons why Gorton might take up
foreign policy first is that it’s easier.)
A Prime Minister has enough crises
of necessity without causing crises that
he can’t easily win and it seems more
likely than not that as a centralist
Gorton will move softly, finessing a
trick here and there if he can get
away with it, but not risking his whole
hand.
Besides, he has enough internal
political problems within his own
Cabinet without creating new ones. In
both internal coalition relations and
economic policy he is thrown up at
once against the particularly tough
obstacle of John McEwen, wedded to
a narrow muck-’em-up and bail-’em-
out approach to economic matters,
anxious to keep a big proportion of
primary producers as electoral hos-
tages by. keeping them dependent on
Government subsidies and protection,
and for the past few years equally
anxious to keep the less efficient manu-
facturing industries in the trap as well.
Like Calwell in his old age, McEwen
also seems bent on making his place
in history by demonstrating his sheer
destructive power. Gorton expects
bitter arguments with McEwen. His
political life depends on keeping them
merely to the arguing stage. There
seems no doubt that Gorton can enjoy
a fight. But how you win this fight
is anyone’s guess especially with
this year’s battles between the two
coalition parties on the redistribution
of constituency boundaries as a back-
ground reminder of the stark bones of
politics.
How about Gorton’s other opponent
Labor leader Whitlam? Gorton’s
quick victory in the Party room was
probably based more than anything else
on his supporters’ optimistic assessment
of his ability, by projecting himself
and his Government, to come out as
an election winner. Will these expecta-
tions be fulfilled?
This may be decided, of course, by
factors over which Gorton has no final
control. The Labor Party’s capacity
for self-slaughter may settle the issue
for Gorton in his own favor without
his doing much about it. On the other
hand, a continuing bad run from Mc-
Ewen could finish off the Coalition
Government, however good a Prime
Minister Gorton looked like being. But
aside from these two questions how
will Gorton line up against Whitlam,
other things being equal?
Almost certainly, better than his pre-
decessor. In so far as Parliament mat-
ters (and parliamentarians usually
exaggerate its importance) Gorton has
a style that is both tougher and more
coherent than Holt’s: he is not likely
to leave so many holes for Whitlam
to put his fingers through and he can
give a better impression of intellectual
command of what he is talking about.
In his private life he is something of
an average Australian convivial com-
pany, booze, TV, a bit of gardening,
an occasional swim. He is as casual
and open in style as Holt, but without
the controversial socialite connotations
that sometimes rebounded against
Holt’s public image. Mrs. Gorton
would seem a first-class asset. A woman
who takes a university course after her
children have grown up probably pre-
sents a swinging voter’s view of the
ideal woman. More than Holt, Gorton
may contrast with Whitlam as more
blunt, less studied, more “sincere.”
But these are just the wrappings of
the product. It is the product itself that
will count. If Gorton can combine his
natural dash with the kind of staff work
that might allay the uncertainties he
has about his decisions, and if he can get
some new things going, look as if he
belongs to the age, he will give Whitlam
formidable and probably successful
opposition. If he doesn’t achieve this—
he is done for, unless the Labor Party
saves him by its own ineptitude, as it
well may. And here expediency should
join with principle in Gorton’s drama-
tising as quickly as possible a new role
for Australia in South-East Asia. There
is a commendable emptiness in Aus-
tralians about their place in the world,
the need for a new rhetoric, a new
approach, as if Australia were beginning
all over again. If Gorton does not
provide this, Whitlam might do it for
him.
On Tuesday last week, at 2.30, as the
Liberal Party meeting was due to start,
the Commonwealth car with the Cl
numberplate drew up outside the steps
of Parliament House and waited, empty,
as Australia waited to see who was
going to win it. When its new owner
later came out on the steps there was
something very fine in the way in which
he reacted to the holiday crowds who
had been standing there waiting to see
him. Menzies would probably have
gone out the back way and avoided
them. Harold Holt would have gone
out the front way, but he may have
been uncertain about what to do. John
Gorton knew what to do. He shook
their hands, signed their autograph
books, and then cupped his hands to his
mouth and shouted his thanks. The
crowd gave him three cheers. If he can
carry this style into his Prime Minister-
ship our history may give him three
cheers as well.


Mintoff among
the Maltese
By CHARLES HIGHAM
GARDEN ISLAND DOCKYARD: a
shimmer of January heat, and against
■the looming dock cranes and the hot
blue lake of Sydney Harbor the harsh
dark faces and Arabic dialect of Maltese
workers. They have come to see
Dominic Mintoff, enormously popular
Maltese Labor leader, fierce orator of
the Valletta streets, construction boss
and Rhodes Scholar, whose looks are
those of a “New Statesman” ideal of
the working man’s intellectual: horn-
rims, thinning black hair, reassuring
pipe and pouch, coat and tie off for
the platform, like a schoolmaster
making an end-of-term speech.
To the 100-odd Maltese machinists,
fitters, and dockyard laborers gathered
to hear him and to present him with a
chronometer in a box the size of a
dog’s coffin, this is clearly a big
moment. Australian workers have come
to listen, too, and although Mintoff
makes part of his speech in Maltese,
immigrants and Sydneysiders look
equally attentive. Despite Mintoff’s
bitter charges when here about the
failure to register Maltese immediately
for old-age pensions, while making their
youths serve in Vietnam the look of
assimilation is complete, so that the
remark of a woman bystander, “Look
at all those Chocolate Malts,” seems
vulgarly anachronistic and out of place.
That same night there is a barbecue
in open country near Blacktown. The
stream of Maltese-owned cars bumps
along a road little better than a dirt
track, chalky dust rising in thick clouds
through an atmosphere of heat as thick
as cheese. The ambience is fiercely
European working class: the shrill,
coarse cries of a Maltese folk-singer
relentlessly delivered into two spinning
tapes, rubbish scattered on the ground,
and at long trestle tables the traditional
Maltese dish of fried whole rabbit
served from steaming metal containers.
Flags and fairy lights strung on poles, a
transistor radio attached to the public
address system thudding out country-
and-western numbers,
When Mintoff arrives, 500 people
dash forward, almost swamping the car.
Not an English voice to be heard, and
inside the crudely built house we might
as well be in a Maltese village. A long,
narrow table is crammed with his
admirers as, blinking behind his horn-
rims, Mintoff talks informally. The
heat is almost overpowering, accentu-
ated as arcs blaze and TV cameras
turn. A moth circles the naked light-
Maltese at Blacktown, on the outskirts of Sydney, prepare for the arrival of Malta’s Opposition Leader, Mr. Dom Mintoff


bulb dangling from the ceiling, and
there is a picture of The Last Supper
on the wall.
In his speech that follows, Mintoff
sums up the feelings of the Maltese
immigrant: his hunger for home, his
ambivalent attitude to England, that
careless guardian which has left so many
Maltese deeply embittered, his often
uneasy attitude toward Malta itself.
It is an expertly calculated speech,
designed to hit every nerve of personal
concern, and the applause and cheering
are deafening.
Although timed very badly indeed ' —
during the holidays when many of the
Maltese are out of town Mintoff’s
visit is a predictable personal success.
When he returns to Malta, he will have
the enormous political advantage of
being able to bring word of their loved
ones to vast numbers of Maltese, since
nearly every family on the island has
a relative in Australia.
Exact figures are hard to come by,
but at a conservative estimate there are
100,000 Maltese here, about one-third
of the population of Malta itself. Aus-
tralia is, to the Maltese, a haven from
an island the history of which has been
deeply tragic, and whose seemingly
incurable labor problems have made
life there an appalling struggle for much
of this century.
Consider Malta itself: a rock almost
without springs, 17 miles long, parched
and almost treeless, its soil scorched
brutally by the sun, and with 300,000
people one of the most densely popu-
lated places on earth. Even its soil has
often had to be brought in from Sicily
by cargo boat and conserved carefully
to keep the smattering of small farmers
alive.
For years the Maltese people
a mixture of Arab, Sicilian, Norman,
Spanish, French, and, recently, Eng-
lish blood have had a tormented
relationship with Britain. Dependent
on the British naval dockyards at
Valletta and the British military in-
stallations for most of their work, they
have greeted bitterly the gradual with-
drawal of British power from the
island and its failure to meet fully the
problems this withdrawal has caused.
Already angry because of the contempt
with which they feel so many British
people treat them (“They think of us
as Arabs,” one Garden Island fitter told
me, “but we know we are British”),
they were further embittered in many
cases by the awarding to them of the
George Cross for bravery during the
Axis bombardment of World War 11.
As a worker said to me at Blacktown:
“They gave us the George Cross as a
sop. If they’d given us three factories
for people to work in we might have
had some respect for them.”
When Prince Philip opened the Mal-
tese Independent Parliament in 1964
his motorcade was stoned and his
Dom Mintoff, Australia badge in lapel, listens intently to a fellow-
countryman now living here. Right, at a barbecue for Mintoff, fried
whole rabbit and no word of English
arrival at Parliament House greeted
with boos. When, in 1967, the British
Government announced it would with-
draw two-thirds of its military garrison
by 1970-71, furious reprisals involved
the grounding of British planes. In spite
of the personal success of Queen Eliza-
beth’s recent visit, feeling against Britain
still runs high, since it has for so long
guaranteed the security of at least a
portion of Maltese workers, and its
abandonment of Malta too small to
stand on its own may well mean
near-ruin in the future. Compromise
efforts are now being made by Britain
to discover alternative means of work
under a special steering committee
headed by Lord Robens.
Alongside this problem, the Maltese
have faced the closing of the Suez
Canal. After the British withdrew from
the naval dockyards at least there was
the hope that passing merchant ships
could be lightered and serviced, that
Malta would rise from the ashes as a
great entrepot of European passing
trade, the role it occupied in the
Napoleonic wars. Yet it is in this
crucial period that migration to Aus-
tralia has been slashed by 50 percent.
The Emigration Attache of the High
Commissioner for Malta in Sydney said
the reasons for these cuts were an in-
crease on the Canadian quota as well
as hopes of work before the Suez Canal
closed; Mintoff gave the reasons as
fear of conscription for Vietnam. The
truth probably is a combination of all
three.
Until the past two years the flood
of Maltese immigration has been con-
tinuous from just after World War 11,
with assisted passages arranged from
1948. In the early years of the century
(according to Joseph Forace, real estate
man and host of Mintoff here, farming
immigrants had been coming almost
since the First Fleet), feeling against
these people ran high. They spoke
Arabic dialect; they were swarthier and
darker skinned than Italians or Greeks
or Spanish; they had at the time
little command of English, and they
arrived poverty-stricken, to be engaged
as dirt-cheap labor. It was a xenophobic
era, and one wretched batch of 206,
arriving in Sydney in 1916 from an
eighth-rate French freighter, was jeered
at the docks.
But gradually things began to im-
prove; there was a notably successful
settlement at Mackay, where Maltese
from Mosta dug in their heels as sugar-
cane farmers en masse; and Maltese,
always thrifty, managed to pay for their
relatives to come here from home and
offer them decent accommodation when
they arrived: the horror of the migrant
hostels has always been largely dodged
by this community. Once here, despite
a fierce nostalgia for the endless island
festivals, marked by brilliant exploding
rockets called murtali, held seemingly
every day of the year by the Catholic
Church, the Maltese settled in quite
well. Ahead of them lay the struggle
for a house and a car that an Aus-
tralian ethos rapidly made obligatory;
many prospered; and communities grew
up at Sunshine and Wentworthville,
at Pendle Hill, Matraville, and Mackay.
The Maltese established their own
newspapers, many of them short-lived:
today there are three, of which the
most flourishing is former “Sydney
Morning Herald” journalist Lawrence
Dimech’s “Maltese Herald,” published
in Sydney and selling 10,000 copies a
week. 1
The Maltese set up their own clubs.
Mostly these were just coffee shops, but
in recent years they have been aug-
mented by the bustling Maltese Settlers’
Club (500 members), headquartered in
Sydney and founded in 1950 by Egg
Board inspector John Patrick Albany.
The life of the cafe and the night streets
that the Maltese miss so much has been
partly compensated for by .this, and,
in Sydney, by the rise of the Australian

licensed clubs, which absorb the Maltese
into a boozy, jolly suburban atmosphere
without much trouble.
At home, Maltese are mainly wine
drinkers, but there are local Maltese
beers there as well, and they soon get
used to drinking beer exclusively here.
They take to steak well enough, and
can obtain here ample supplies of their
favorite rabbit. There is no longer a
girl problem, and young Maltese men
date Australian birds without any feel-
ing of difference on either side (unless
the girl happens to be staunchly Pro-
testant; nearly every Maltese is a prac-
tising Roman Catholic). Good looking,
well built, and naturally dark-skinned,
Maltese are practically indistinguishable
in the democratic jumble of an Aus-
tralian beach.
Less volatile and touchy than other
Mediterranean peoples, the Maltese are
regarded highly by their employers
here, and secretary of the Ironworkers’
Federation, Laurie Short, among others,
spoke to me of their excellence and
reliability as workers. Many have risen
high in the professions: among these the
solicitor J. M. Caruana, Charles Cassar
the gynaecologist, and James Zammit,
an executive with the British Motor
Corporation.
According to several people I spoke
to, although the Roman Catholic mis-
sions do excellent work here there
are three, dividing the city into sections,
in Sydney alone and the 2SM week-
end religious broadcasts delivered by a
priest are popular, many of the young
people are beginning to drift from the
Church. Since nearly all are Labor, and
opposed to the Nationalist Government
in Malta, which they regard as being
too tightly controlled by Church inter-
ests under the Archbishop, they tend to
•'resent Catholicism more and more upon
arrival here.
Mintoff’s arrival has reminded them
vividly that at one stage it was a mortal
sin to vote for him, that he and his
ministers lay under the threat of ex-
communication. Maltese take much
interest in local politics, and almost all
vote ALP at the election polls; I heard
savage criticism of the DLP from
several workers I spoke to. Sport is
mainly Soccer: the Melita Eagles, the
Maltese Soccer team in Australia, has
struggled up, despite poor supplies of
funds, to a First Division place, but it
cannot yet afford a sufficient number
of top-flight players.
Housing is a major problem: it is
hard to save for a home when you are
making only $3O a week, and the
Maltese and Australian Governments
have recently tried to give some relief
by lending $9OOO at 5J percent termi-
nating interest on a 25 percent deposit
to selected applicants. Unhappily, only
25 people in Victoria and 25 in New
South Wales can be satisfied in the first
year of the scheme, and this is going to
involve a vast surplus of applicants.
In 1966-67, only 1572 Maltese came
here, compared with 5000 in 1965. If
Mintoff has anything to .do with it,
fewer and fewer will come from now
on. One doubts that, even if the Aus-
tralian Government makes pensions
available any earlier to immigrants,
Mintoff would encourage a situation in
which young Maltese would fight in
Vietnam, a war to which as an extreme
Left-wing figure he is naturally and
violently opposed.
Yet, clearly, with its huge internal
problems, Malta should be sending us its
people, and today they are very wel-
come indeed. Speaking to the Maltese
in clubs and workshops, on the docks,
and in the country leaves one with a
strong impression of dogged determina-
tion, energy, humor, and resilience:
qualities essential in the immigrant. One
hopes that, just when we are happiest
with the Maltese, when they are verv
successfully a totally assimilated,
invisible community in our midst,
we aren’t going to lose the flower
of their new generation to other
countries.




I was a chalkie for the Pope
By RICHARD RICE
I WAS ACTUALLY GRATEFUL
for my first teaching post, for, as I
soon discovered, appointments in in-
dependent schools are made three, if
not six, months in advance. By Jan-
uary, the teacher shortage notwith-
standing, there’s scarcely a decent job
left. Fortunately, however, one of the
Brothers at a certain St. Theodore’s
College chose that month to go to his
reward, which necessitated the hasty
placing of advertisements for a “His-
tory/English Teacher, new position.
Apply Brother Superior.” The whole
show was experiencing, I later learned,
an acute form of superior panic at the
time of my tentatively telephoning:
Beep beep. Beep beep.
“Saint Theo’s.”
“May I speak to the Superior,
please?”
“Speaking.”
“Ah, Brother. I’m ringing in con-
nection with your advertisement in
“Oh, good! When can you start?”
St. Theo’s was a pretty posh school.
Not quite Geelong Grammar, perhaps,
but the boys did wear striped ties and
boaters. It was also a pretty tough
school not quite Timbertop, per-
haps, but the boys did pick their noses.
At eight o’clock the following Wed-
nesday I reported to the Superior’s
office. He wasn’t there. By the time I
had finished a furtive fag, though, I
was at the head of quite a queue. At
8.25 a harassed figure in black came
hurtling in.
“Have you signed an application for
enrolment?”
“Please, sir, I’m a teacher, not a
parent.”
“Teacher? Teacher? Er, you must be
Mr. . . .?”
“Rice, sir.”
“Er, yes. You’d better come in.”
The interview had begun. Still
anxious to impress, I made a cautious
comment. “That’s a very fine print
you have on the wall, sir.”
“Print? You like it? Good you’ll
teach Art then. Four periods a day,
starting in Third Form 3C. Here’s
the syllabus. I’ll let you have the rest
of your timetable at recess. Glad you
were able to come, Mr. Rice. Good
morning.”
Ejected thus into the quadrangle, I
felt a little lost. The clock said 8.30,
so there was still a half-hour before
zero, I thought. Perhaps there was a
staff room somewhere, where I might
meet some of my colleagues and find
out just where on earth 3C lived.
Selecting a nearby youth, one of the
few who seemed shorter than my own
six feet, I approached with a view to
asking directions. My mouth was
scarcely open when a violent
cacophony broke out from the bell, and
I turned to see a powerfully built monk
belting hell out of it. The effect was
positively splendid. Eight hundred boys
appeared from nowhere, and within
60 seconds ten or a dozen straight lines
had formed up in the quadrangle.
The campanophile scooped up a tran-
sistorised loud hailer and issued a few
bellicose instructions. Before another
minute had elapsed the whole 800
had trooped in orderly fashion to their
rooms. Again I was impressed Ah,
I thought, the discipline here is good!
There’ll be no trouble with these boys.”
It had all been so short jind sweet
that the quadrangle was vacated before
it dawned on me that I still didn’t
know where to go. Just as it was dawn-
ing, the significance of the scene I had
just witnessed also seeped through
in this school, classes started at 8.30!
The blood in my veins ran chilled
with the utter barbarity of it. Nine
o’clock, I had considered, was bad
enough.
Not a soul was in sight, so a self-
conducted tour of the campus com-
menced. Rather a lot of noise was
coming from the Science lab., but tak-
ing no heed I meandered along the
maze of corridors (an architectural
gem, this place), hoping to meet some-
body. Two flights of steps and a
few turns later, I found myself again
outside the Science lab. The noise
was continuing, unabated, when above
the general racket there issued a loud
four-letter word in a rich, lusty bari-
tone. Listening curiously to see how
the master inside dealt with the situa-
tion, it soon became apparent that
there was no master there. It also
became apparent, in a brief space, that
the room contained no less than my
sought-after 3C.
There was nothing else for it but to
front up to them. Waiting a moment
so they wouldn’t realise that the recent
obscenity had been overheard, I flung
open the door and marched in. A
scraping of stools as they all stood
up, and then silence.
“Good morning, gentlemen.”
“Good morning, sir.”
“Sit down. You are 3C. Several
times each week I shall be taking you
for Art. I think it would be a good
idea if we had a look at the syllabus.”
It would actually have been a better
idea to examine the syllabus a month
before, but it was too late for that
now. Opening the precious document,
I scanned it quickly to see what it
contained. “This syllabus is based on
the assumption that all people are
creative,” I read, “and there exist
within us the potentialities of artistic
expression.”
I snatched a quick look at the audi-
ence, then buried my nose in the folder
again. Even that brief glance was
enough to give me misgivings as to
whether this lot would have enough
intelligence to procreate let alone
create. Further, there were pages and
pages of this kind of stuff; far too
much to be summarised in a hurry.
Worse, the natives were getting rest-
less. I should have to do something.
If all else fails, a friend in the trade
had told me, take their names. Full
names, in strict alphabetical order.
You can use a whole period that way.
“But before we go any further,” I
announced, “I must get your names.
In strict alphabetical order.” So it
began. Unfortunately, this particular
class had had their names taken in
strict alphabetical order so often that
the whole lot knew the list backwards.
What else to do? A chapter heading
from a recently perused pedagogical
text flashed through the cognitive pro-
cesses: Questions. “Any questions?” I
asked.
It was too transparently a last resort.
A sleepy 14-stone 15-year-old in the
front row raised a lethargic hand.
Yes?” “Sir. How long do you think
you’ll last?”
I was aghast. Perhaps I was saved
by a quick surge of panic or temper;
I don’t know which. “What do you
think you mean, precisely?” “Well—
we’ve broken four masters in the past
six months.” (They had, too, I dis-
covered.) “Just stand up and say that,
son!”
The brawny 14-stoner, who was sit-
ting in one of those desks which have
the seat attached to them, began to
rise heavily to his feet, smirking with
the obvious intent of doing precisely
what I had told 'him. He had reached
half-way when, out of sheer fright, I
gave him a hearty shove. He caught
his foot in the desk leg and crashed to
the floor.
Visions of “ART TEACHER
ASSAULTS CHILD” in the evening
papers sprang before me, but the
reaction of the class brought me back
to the present. It was, to my relief and
amazement, one of respectful silence —
and the front-row toughy, as he climbed
gingerly back to his seat, muttered,
“Sorry, sir.”
So began my career as a lay master
in a Catholic school. In the year that
followed I had no more trouble out of
3C, who were basically a happy crowd
and for the most part content to be
amused until, having turned 15, they
could leave school and go out to work
for Woolies. As for teaching them Art,
that was just a joke; they had done
none before, but it had been decreed
from above that they had better have
a go at it, as they had failed everything
else during the past two years.
About half a dozen out of the
original 40 finally scraped through their
Certificate exams; among them was
my 14-stoner, who is now, to every-
one’s surprise, a novice in one of the
stricter religious Orders.
Of course, 3C was not the only class
I taught, nor was Art the only subject.
My original engagement to teach His-
tory and English was, it transpired,
purely nominal. The three-year period
I stayed at St. Theo’s saw me handling
a variety of subjects, from matric.
Economics down through Middle
School English, Geography, Commerce,
Science (which I had failed at 14 and
hadn’t touched since) and Maths, to
Junior School Social .Studies and
Arithmetic. We were terribly short of
staff, so, like all my colleagues there, I
taught 45 periods per week, in addi-
tion to coaching two cricket or football
teams from 4 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. three
afternoons a week, and umpiring or
refereeing for virtually the whole of
Saturday. On Sundays I slept and
went to evening Mass.
There were eight Brothers at the
school and 12 lay masters, to teach
800 boys. The classes were large—
from 40 to 61 —and for one term I
had a second-year class of 110.
Some of the Brothers had occasional
free periods, but of course such privi-
leges could scarcely be accorded the
hired help. Occasionally a newspaper
crept into the Staff Room carrying
items concerning the latest screams
from the State School Teachers’
union about one of their poor hard-
done-by members having a class of 40
(compared to our average of 50), or
being given a teaching load of 32
periods a week (compared to our 45),
or being paid less than $6O per week
(compared to our $42). We sympathised
with all our hearts.
The lay staff were really a pretty
good bunch, though. There were a
couple of retired men blokes who
had reached the Department’s retiring
age, but whq, for vocational or financial
reasons felt obliged to keep on teach-
ing. One of these in particular stands
out in recollection. Well into his
seventies, he was, after 15 years as
Principal of a demonstration school,
practically a one-man teachers’ col-
lege. Certainly I think I learned more
about the theory and practice of edu-
cation during my first year of associ-
ation with this man than I would have
in five years of formal training.
In particular, he taught me how to
program my work effectively. To be-
gin with, I had been very enthusiastic
about “written expression,” and had
drawn up a timetable of regular essays
for each class. This was all very well
until a yard-high pile in my bedroom
and a bit of simple arithmetic told
me that if I set one two-page essay
per week for each subject, there would
be a total of over a thousand pages
of schoolboy writing to mark each
week at home. The program was
soon modified.
Mainly, though, it’s the kids them-
selves who make teaching worth while,
in any kind of school. Their very
variety was, and is, a constant delight.
Parents are an odd lot; some of them
are wildly enthusiastic about anything
and everything to do with their sons
or their school. Others just couldn’t
care less about either.
The mother of the little winger in
my “A” football team was one of the
former. She even came to practices
three times a week to bawl out advice
from the sideline and hand out oranges
at half-time. She knew absolutely noth-
ing about the game, but, my God, she
was keen.
Toward the end of one season we
had a pretty important match which
would decide our place in the semi-
finals. The little winger was in fine
form, and so was Mum. With ten
minutes to go, and a score of 8-all,
the ball came out of a scrum and
was passed beautifully along the back
line to the wing. His mother was
ecstatic. He picked up his feet and
sped down for the try, Mum racing
down the touchline after him scream-
ing “Good on you, son, you little
beauty.” He was certain to make it,
until an opposing forward came belting
across the field from nowhere toward
him. Crisis! We could see that he wasn’t
aware of the danger. Shouts of “Sup-
port! Support!” echoed around. The
support was there, and Mum was howl-
ing loud and clear—“ Look out, son!
Look out! Pass the ball, son! Pass the
ball! Pass the . . .”
And he did. The little beggar passed
it to her. We wept, and went home.
Money was a continuing, never-
decreasing problem, though—not only
for the school but for the lay masters
as well. On the strength of guarantees
from a number of the boys’ fathers,
the school had been able to secure
sufficient bank finance to complete a
$250,000 building program over five
years; the fees, at $35 per term, pro-
vided scarcely enough to paint the
doorknobs, let alone pay adequate
salaries. As the school was in one of
the most “desirable” suburbs, the fee
structure really seemed pretty absurd.
I attended a Fathers’ Night once, and
over a quiet ale down the back put this
view to one of the men who, I knew,
had been one of the guarantors. He
agreed, saying that although he had a
good income he was by no means-
wealthy (he drove a second-hand
Holden), but, like many others, he
felt that his boys’ education came first
in priority, even if it meant that he
had to go into hock to provide it. Just
then we were joined by an immaculate

“Do you know,” he complained,
“I’ve had two letters this term asking
for fees. It’s like their bloody hide.
I put my money on the plate on Sunday

well!”
To me this pinpoints one of the

straight in the eyes of other men whose
sacrifices are making the education of
their sons possible, blandly discarding
any share of responsibility for them-
selves.
Another incident reinforces this
view in my mind. A quite promising
young scientist in Second Form (14-
year-olds) couldn’t get one of the
specially ruled exercise books used for
reporting experiments. Repeated magi-
stral demands were of no avail; his
parents just couldn’t afford it, he said.
Finally I forked out the 45c necessary
and bought the kid one myself. The
following day I had a letter of thanks
from the boy’s father:
“Dear Sir,
Thank you very much for buying
the science book. It was a most
generous gesture, which we appre-
ciated very much indeed.
Yours sincerely,
5?
To this was added: “P.S. It must
be very nice to be so well heeled.”
Well heeled on $42 a week? I
laughed.
A fortnight later I had occasion to
visit this family; the lad was in bed
with a cold and wanted some books.
Looking up their address, I discovered
that they lived only a few streets away
from the place where I was boarding,
so I decided to drop the books off on
the way home from the station. When
I arrived I couldn’t believe my eyes—
a new two-storeyed house, a double
garage with a new Ford of Dad’s and
a Mini of Mum’s, and a twin outboard
speedboat, complete with water-ski
gear and trailer, on the front lawn!
All this, and they couldn’t afford a
lousy 45 cents for a science book.
Nor were they the only ones. At the
end of the year the lay masters were
asked, please, to wait for three weeks,
as there were simply insufficient funds
for their holiday pay. The reason?
The parents of over 200 boys had paid
no fees during the year.
By the end of my third year at St.
Theo’s I was heading for a personal
financial crisis. I had reached my
twenty-fourth summer, and wanted to
get engaged. By that time the weekly
pay packet contained a princely $45,
and I just couldn’t live on it. Board
took $l5 and fares $4, so I was left
with $26 a week. From this I had to
find about $6O a year for clothes,
$lOO a year for university fees (I
had to get that last unit), and about
$2OO dollars a year for books and pro-
fessional journals. Medical, dental, and
very moderate wenching expenses soon
added up. I was flat broke; I couldn’t
even afford the ring.
I could have got out of teaching, I
suppose, but by this time I had chalk
in my veins and was beginning to feel
strongly about the value of Church
schools. So I went to a country board-
ing school, more than a hundred miles
away from the light of my heart, and
where I had to work 80 hours a week
instead of 70. In return I was given
an extra dollar a week and free
board. It was a reputable school, nearly
a century old, with a fine sporting and
academic record. Here again were the
same old troubles, though too many
parents who wouldn’t pay fees, and an
absurd fee scale anyway. The fees for
a senior boarder, covering both board
and tuition, were $2OO per term. Often
the Head complained about fees that
were overdue, but he just wouldn’t
listen to the fact that it was, for many
people, cheaper to have a boy there
than at home.
After two years I had managed to
save a bit; $4OO as a share in a lot-
tery prize helped. By then I had given
a total of five years’ solid “lay apostol-
a.te” (to use a term the annual
vocation-basher was keen on) for half
the salary I’m worth; I hoped that I’d
managed to give some semblance of
Christian education to the sons of
people who lived well on the school
fees they didn’t pay.
The Catholic Church, I decided, has
to make up its mind about those people.
I’d already made up mine. It’s as
simple as this: Parents who enrol their
children in a fee-paying school are
under the strongest moral (never mind
about the legalities) obligation to pay
the fees required. If they don’t, then
they are immoral and therefore bad
Catholics. If the parents are bad
Catholics, the children are likely to be
no better, despite any effect a good
Catholic school might have. Therefore,
the Church ought to take what is
admittedly an unpalatable course of
action, and let these people go.
As far as the city schools are con-
cerned, there would be little change in
enrolments; the Sydney schools alone
are supposed to have a waiting list of
10,000. The country schools might lose
a few, but one wonders whether they’d
be much loss the value of a single
human soul notwithstanding.
With such a change the schools would
be well geared to give a first-class
education to those who remained. Each
school’s income would remain the same,
but its expenses would drop by at least
25 percent. The sum so saved could
be used to facilitate an adequate staff
structure, and even leave enough for
a sinking fund for the children of
parents in genuinely hard circum-
stances.
I still believe in Church schools, but
until the Church applies a bit of com-
mon sense to its education system, I’ll
stay where I am, teaching for the
Protestants, whose ideals in education
I have found to be practically identi-
cal, and who will pay me the kind of
salary on which a professional teacher
can keep himself, his wife, and his
small but growing family.


OVERSEAS
The pride of tho poor
before Britain’s fall
AS BRITAIN’S messengers of doom —
George Brown in Washington, George
Thomson in Singapore, Malaysia, Aus-
tralia, and New Zealand, and Goronwy
Roberts in the Persian Gulf returned
to London in time to tie up the ends
of the package presented to Parliament
on Tuesday, the surprise was that the
Americans were surprised by what
George Brown had to tell them.
Essentially, the bad news that George
Thomson brought to Australia, New
Zealand, Singapoi'e, and Malaysia was
old news. Questions of British with-
drawal from this part of the world
have for some time been merely when,
and not how much, but Washington
officials were astonished and actively
resentful about what Britain intended
doing in the Persian Gulf.
From Washington, Anthony Howard
reports: U.S. officials have described
Britain’s decision to withdraw from the
Persian Gulf as “irresponsible and pre-
cipitate.” Incredible as it seems, neither
the White House nor the State Depart-
ment had any official warning of the
British Cabinet’s proposal to sacrifice
not only Singapore but also Bahrain in
its new axing of Government spending.
Mr. George Brown’s visit to Wash-
ington last Thursday was dominated
by American protests on the Persian
Gulf issue protests which went all
the way to a personal phone call by
Johnson phoned his protest from Texas
President Johnson from his Texas ranch
to the British Foreign Secretary while
Mr. Brown was in the middle of a
formal lunch at the British Embassy.
There are no convincing explanations
as to why the U.S. Administration has
been so badly taken aback by this aspect
of the British Govei'nment’s economy
measures. Despite the State Depart-
ment’s minatory noises about the perils
of a British military evacuation from
the Far East by 1971, it is fairly clear
that weeks ago these had come to be
accepted as inevitable, even by Mr.
Rusk.
However, that is by no means true of
the British Government’s proposals to
do exactly the same in the Middle
East proposals which still seem
logically indefensible to the Johnson
Administration, if only because of the
British Government’s previously an-
nounced intention to increase its gar-
rison in Bahrain and the Trucial States
from 4000 to 7000 as the direct con-
sequence of the withdrawal from Aden.
British diplomats in Washington, bv
conti ast, confess themselves frankly
puzzled as to whv the various experts in
the State Department and the Pentagon
did not wake up much earlier to
what, they maintain, was an obvious
and almost inevitable option for a
British Government determined to cut
defence expenditure. It was not in
the nature of the exercise, they slightly
condescendingly point out, that they
should be expected to explain to their
American opposite numbers exactly
what was going on. All that was
needed was for them to use minimum
intelligence and imagination.
Why, then, did the Americans, as
their present state of appalled shock
only too clearly betrays, fail to do so?
The most plausible theory has it that
the U.S., as a great mercantile military
power, found it starkly inconceivable
that any government would be pre-
pared to take the risks to its own
world financial position that the British
Government is now courting—and all
for the sake of 7000 troops. There is
some personal evidence to back up this
theory. Only two days before Mr.
Brown’s arrival, one senior Adminis-
tration official was prepared to dismiss
all rumors of a British military with-
drawal from the Gulf as “not only
alarmist but absurd.”
Against this background it is not
surprising that the British. Foreign
Secretary’s visit to Washington last
week caused dismay from the start.
The Administration officials appear to
have been convinced that the purpose
of Mr. Brown’s dramatic dash from
Tokyo w r as “consultation.” It there-
fore came as all the more of a shock
to discover that the only objective of
the British Foreign Secretary’s mission
was to provide advance notice of
decisions the Cabinet had already
reached.
However, this was not a shock for
which the British Government was any-
thing like solely responsible. In marked
contrast to the protracted and agonised
Anglo-American discussions that pre-
ceded both the defence review of the
spring in 1966 and the July economy
cuts of the same year, there was on this
occasion virtually no initiative on the
American side to discover still less
to influence - the direction of the
British Cabinet’s thinking.
In some quarters this failure even
to investigate what was going on is
ascribed to a general sense of frustra-
tion among American officials at how
little all their previous hectic efforts
to keep the Wilson Cabinet on the right
rails had achieved in the end. “We were
simply not prepared,” an official said
after Mr. Brown’s visit, “to expend
all that time and energy to no purpose
again.”
There is, however, an alternative
interpretation which goes far more to
the heart of the present state of Anglo-
American relations. The truth of the
matter, arguably, is that once the em-
bers of sentimental attachment in the
traditional (and now mythical) special
relationship had ceased to glow, there
suddenly dawned a realisation on both
Brown took Johnson's call in Washington


sides that there could really be no
genuine community of interest between
a modern imperial power that still
believes in its role in the world and a
country of distressed gentle folk that
has gradually come to accept that all
its failures and disappointments can
be attributed to a heroic, if vain,
endeavor to live up to its past.
There remains, naturally, the ele-
ments of recrimination and bitterness
on either side. A strong suspicion exists
in Washington, even among British
officials, that if the notion of a world
role for Britain has survived for at least
three years longer than it ought to have
done, it owes a good deal to the skill
with which LBJ has played on the
vanity of British Ministers, and per-
haps on the Prime Minister in par-
ticular.
From the American side, this is
met by the counter-charge that the
only fault of the Johnson Administra-
tion has been to take the British
Prime Minister’s Churchillian affirma-
tions at face value. Significantly, one
high-placed official is nowadays even
prepared to recall a scene in which
he claims Mr. Wilson thrust out his
hand and announced: “You can count
on me, Mr. President.” The official
adds, perhaps with understandable bit-
terness: “That was when the British
Prime Minister was talking about the
British Government’s determination to
see the East of Suez thing through.”
But there is, of course, more to it
than that. The U.S. Administration
may well and for the next few
weeks undoubtedly will feel that it
has been badfy betrayed by a lack of
firmness on the part of the British
Government. However, the fact remains
that it has always chosen to assume
as the rich often do when confronted
by the poor that only a weak-minded
failure of domestic management and
efficiency is responsible for Britain’s
economic ills. This inevitably has meant
that the offer of any form of economic
subvention to prop up Britain’s world
commitments has, from the beginning,
been firmly ruled out as only too likely
to encourage spendthrift and wasteful
ways.
Whether such an offer from the U.S.
would in the event have made any dif-
ference -no one will ever know. -
But that even in their current
annoyed mood there are one or two
American officials who now firmly be-
lieve that perhaps the most expensive
error made by the Johnson Administra-
tion lies in it not having recognised
long ago that the declared British re-
solve to remain not only in the Far
East, but the Middle East as well, owed
far more o to the pride of the poor
than to any confident assessment of
the country’s self-interest.
U.S. Presidency
A dreamboat opponent for LBJ?
THE LAST THING that anyone
anticipated was that 1968 would see
one of the most battered American
Presidents in history riding high. But
that, according to the first opinion polls
of the year, is what is now happening.
Three months ago President Johnson
was shown as trailing every conceivable
Republican rival. Now he has van-
quished them all and begins to look, if
not “a shoo-in,” then a-t least easily the
favorite for next November’s Presiden-
tial election.
Political fortune is notoriously fickle
but most commentators have none-
theless confessed themselves stumped by
the reasons for the sudden turn-about
in LBJ’s re-election prospects.
Only one theory has any ring of con-
viction. It is that the sudden upturn
in the President’s popularity has little
or nothing to do with any new verdict
on LBJ’s personality or performance,
but it arises instead from the elector-
ate’s mind having been concentrated
wonderfully by a contemplation of the
most obvious available alternatives.
The Republican Party has thrown
away chances before, but it has never
perhaps squandered a political oppor-
tunity quite so wantonly as the one
offered to it in the past year. The
moderate and potentially electorally
attractive wing of the Party is now
in almost as complete disarray as it was
in 1964. Having prematurely placed its
shirt on the lacklustre Governor
George Romney of Michigan, it has
had to stand by increasingly discom-
fited as the luckless Governor has
floundered deeper and deeper into ever-
bigger trouble.
There can rarely have been a story
in American politics to equal the
murder or suicide of Governor
Romney as a Presidential prospect.
Only 12 months ago he looked all but
invincible a man who had won for
the Republicans three successive elec-
toral victories (the last by a landslide
of half a million votes) in a tradition-
ally Democratic citadel, who had one
of the best records for efficient State
administration in the nation, who by
his silence, if nothing else, had preserved
his options on foreign policy.
But the path lying before a Presi-
dential aspirant is a treacherous hurdle
course, and it soon became apparent
that the Governor had neither the skill
nor the stamina to survive it.
More damaging perhaps even than
the famous confession about having
been “brainwashed” on a visit to Saigon
was the relentlessly built-up impression
that George Romney—a man of un-
doubted goodwill—did not know his
own mind on any issue. The most
familiar phrase in the notebooks of
reporters covering him on the campaign
trail was jocularly said to be “the
Governor later explained.” And cer-
tainly there seemed to be fewer and
'fewer statements made by Romney that
did not subsequently call for “elucida-
tion” or even on occasions “correction.”
Yet George Romney’s obvious reluct-
ance to get out of the race has nonethe-
less blocked entry by any other liberal
Republican nominee. Thus the Party
currently finds itself face-to-face with
the seemingly inescapable prospect of
Richard Nixon emerging as its standard-
bearer at Miami Beach next August.
At the recent Republican Governors’
conference in Florida this was an out-
come accepted more with resignation
than enthusiasm —and for understand-
able reasons. No one questions Nixon’s
professionalism as a campaigner—but
at the same time it is an open secret
that he is Lyndon Johnson’s dreamboat
of an opponent.
It is not merely that after his two
successive defeats for the Presidency
in 1960 and for the Californian
Governorship in 1962 he is tagged
with the “loser” image. Even more
important, his mere presence on the
Republican ticket is only too liable
to cancel out LBJ’s greatest single
weakness as a candidate, his widespread
reputation as “a wheeler-dealer.” Not
for nothing, after all, was the whole
Democratic attack on Nixon in 1960
concentrated on the one simple ques-
tion, “Would you buy a secondhand
car from this man?”
There remains, of course, faint hope
among the liberal Republicans that the
lightning may yet strike, that Governor
Nelson Rockefeller of New York could
finally be induced to enter the lists.
But the chances of that happening
Nixon . .. tagged as a loser


must inevitably diminish as the months
go by.
The harsh truth is that Nixon, with
three or four primary victories, even
against Romney, under his belt, will
very rapidly become invulnerable to a
last-minute assault even from Rocke-
feller.
The irony for the Republicans, how-
ever, is that no candidate could be
more vulnerable than Nixon to doubts
from independent voters in the actual
election. Conceivably it is that that
the polls are already beginning to re-
flect.
Cambodia
Cooler pursuit
PRINCE SIHANOUK of Cambodia
has now formally asked India, which is
chairman of the International Control
Commission for Vietnam, to take steps
to strengthen the ICC force in order
to check and report violations of Cam-
bodian frontiers. The message reached
Delhi just before Mr. Chester Bowles,
American Ambassador in India, re-
turned from Phnom Penh after long
talks with Prince Sihanouk.
Talking to journalists in Delhi, Mr.
Bowles indicated a marked change in
the United States’ attitude to the
Prince, whom he described as a true
nationalist. ’ Mr. Bowles was positive
that American troops would not cross
the Cambodian frontier in “hot pur-
suit, ’ which was a newspaper term, he
said. The U.S. was prepared to supply
the ICC with helicopters, jeeps, and
communication equipment to make a
good job of detecting infiltrators into
Cambodia.
Meanwhile, Indian officials are con-
fronted with news reports from Phnom
Penh that the Soviet Union, co-
chairman of the Geneva Conference,
and Poland, a member of the ICC,
have refused to accept any proposal
to strengthen the ICC. American
circles in India dismiss these statements
as mere public postures to appease pro-
Peking elements, but they may well be
wrong. The Russian Ambasssador to
Delhi, Mr. Pegov, called at the Indian
Ministry of External Affairs and,
though no official statement has been
released, it is understood that his talks
related to the reactivation of the ICC
and the Russian Government’s sus-
picions about the motives for this.
Mr. Bowles was very diplomatic
about Hanoi’s recent peace feelers, say-
ing that he did not discuss the war
nor even notice the absence of the
Foreign Minister of Cambodia, who
was on a visit to Hanoi, and returned
before Mr. Bowles left Phnom Penh.
There are indications that peace moves
have not been given up as hopeless,
but it may be some time before the
positions of the various parties clear
up. China’s views as a member of the
Geneva Conference cannot be entirely
ignored, and this may turn out to be
the biggest snag in the pursuit of peace
in Vietnam.
The issue now is whether the ICC
can decide by a majority vote to
strengthen its force, or has to have the
concurrence of the Geneva co-chairmen,
Britain and the Soviet Union.
The strength of the ICC today is
at its lowest, fewer than 100 persons,
according to information here. The
American estimate is that about 60,000
North Vietnamese troops are concen-
trated in several groups and dispersed
along Cambodia’s eastern border. Mr.
Bowles said that there were indications
of an “offensive” by the Viet Cong, and
if U.S. troops were able to repulse them
from the paddy-fields they would cross
the border and swell the numbers
already in Cambodia.

China
Harvesting folly
THE CULTURAL revolution may
have cost China its biggest harvest ever.
The weather in 1967 looked like the
best since the bumper year in 1958
and perhaps the best since the Com-
munists came to power. Since 1958,
much more fertiliser has been applied,
and mechanisation and irrigation have
also increased; so, on normal calcula-
tions, last year’s crop should have been
well over 200 million tons. But, accord-
ing to the American Consulate-General
in Hong Kong, the disruption in farm
work and in the delivery of agricul-
tural supplies, particularly fertiliser,
during the reign of the Red Guards
took their toll. The grain crop, the
Consulate estimates, was only. 187 mil-
lion tons.
A New Year editorial in the “People’s
Daily” has now claimed “a bumper
harvest unparalleled in history.” But,
for the seventh year in a row, no figures
are offered. So outside estimates, calcu-
lated from a vast collection of evidence
ranging from refugee reports to snippets
from local newspapers, are all there is
to go on.
The American Consulate estimates
are among the most reliable data avail-
able on the Chinese economy. Yet they
are by no means unchallenged. Even
within the American Government there
are respected economists who have been
arguing for years that the Consulate’s
estimates are too low. They accept the
higher figures which the Chinese have
issued informally to favored visitors
from time to time, beginning with Mao’s
remarks to Lord Montgomery in 1961.
The highest of these was the estimate
of a 200-million-ton grain harvest in
1964 which Mao gave to Edgar Snow.
The Consulate agrees that 1964 was a
good year, but it puts the harvest at
190 million tons.
Among the standard data that go
into the estimating process are reports
of food shortages. The experts who
contest the Consulate’s figures insist
that if the harvest was actually as poor
as the Consulate claims there would be
widespread starvation in China and
there has been no evidence of this in
recent years. In 1967 there were reports
of local food shortages from the south-
ern provinces of Chekiang, Fukien,
Kwangtung, Kwangsi, and Kweichow.
But these shortages, none of which
reached famine proportions, may well
have been caused by disruptions in
transport and other repercussions of the
general unrest. The Consulate predicts
that despite the good harvest there may
be more shortages this winter in
large urban centres and in the chronic-
ally deficit northern provinces of Hopei,
Shansi, Honan, Shantung, and Liaon-
ing. These would be the result of diffi-
culties in Government procurement.
Peasants and local officials have been


showing considerable reluctance to give
up their precious supplies of grain.
The harvest figures by themselves
give only a vague indication of how
well the Chinese are eating these days.
They must be considered in relation to
another set of disputed figures the
estimates of China’s population. Here
again the Chinese are not much help
on statistics: the last census was in
1953. The Chinese Press is at present
using the rough figure of 700 million.
But Western estimates, derived from
evaluations of the 1953 census, range
from 740 million to over 900 million.
The American Government econo-
mists who assume the best about Chin-
ese harvests use a population figure of
760 million for 1967. On this basis they
calculate that the Chinese today are
still not getting as much grain per
person as they did ten years ago or
in the better years of the 19305. The
optimistic prognosis is that they will
not reach this level of consumption,
which is the accepted international
minimum of 300 kilograms per person
per year, until 1970. To do this they
will have to make significant increases
in agricultural investment and re-
frain from any more cultural revolu-
tions.
Israel
Budgeting for war
THE ISRAELI Government is quietly
marshalling its defences for the pos-
sibility of a fourth war with the Arab
States. Hope has by no means been
given up that peace may be achieved,
but Israel’s leaders feel they cannot
take any chances.
A number of recent developments
have cast this attitude into sharp relief.
The first is the Defence Budget for the
fiscal year beginning in April, 1968,
which is higher than any previous one.
Secondly, Israel is also making deter-
mined efforts to strengthen and re-
juvenate its Air Force, which, though
victorious in the June war, is threat-
ened with obsolescence by the time a
new warlike encounter may break out.
The new Chief of Staff, Major-General
Haim Bar-Lev, declared in a statement
on the day he took command that
Israel would not be overawed by
threats of Soviet volunteers. And steps
are being taken to redress Israel’s man-
power imbalance by trying to attract
more immigrants from the West.
Israel’s budget for 1968-69, which
has just been submitted to the Knesset
(Parliament), totals nearly 6000 million
Israeli pounds (about $l5OO million).
One-quarter of this is set aside for the
Defence Ministry, while additional
military expenditures which are
divulged only to the Parliamentary
Defence Committee are concealed
within other budgetary items.
A large part of the Defence Budget
is earmarked for the arms procure-
ment how much of it will depend
on whether President de Gaulle per-
sists in his refusal to deliver to Israel
the 40 Mirage V jets which were
ordered over a year ago and are now
being made ready at the Dassault
works. Two-thirds of the price has
been paid in advance. Should Israel
be forced to substitute more expensive
U.S.-made Phantom jets for the
Mirages, as reported from abroad, this
would make further inroads into the
country’s finances.
On New Year’s Eve, Major-General
Haim Bar-Lev, who had been formally
installed a few hours earlier as Israel’s
new Chief of Staff, gave a remarkable
radio interview. Asked about the pos-
sibility of Soviet “volunteers” one day
fighting alongside the Egyptians, he
indicated that Israel would take on
allcomers, so long as it was not a
matter of direct intervention by a world
power. Volunteers were not the end
of the world for Israel, he said.
“One should bear in mind that the
Israeli Army has the advantage of ex-
perience in three wars against Egypt.
Russian volunteers with no such ex-
perience and not fighting for their own
country, as the Israelis would be,
would be a doubtful match.” Israel
would never follow Czechoslovakia’s
example before the Russians, he im-
plied, but rather that of Finland.
The manpower problem has become
acute as a result of the six-day war
and its aftermath. Two and a half
million Jews are just not enough to
maintain a modern infrastructure like
Irsael’s protected by a military force
with a highly sophisticated weaponry.
Conscription may therefore have to be
extended both for men and women.
The obvious remedy is immigration.
Unless circumstances change, 20,000
newcomers are expected this year, but
still more are needed. The President
of the World Zionist Organisation, Dr.
Nahum Goldmann, is now sponsoring
the establishment of a “League of
Practising Zionists” within the Organi-
General Haim Bar-Lev ... not overawed
sation: they would undertake to
immigrate to Israel within three to
four years. The Israeli Government,
on its part, has promised to enact a
new law giving a series of privileges
to newcomers to smooth the initial
difficulties of their integration.
Russia
Freedom writers
NOT EVERYTHING is clear about
Russia’s latest “literary” trial which
ended on Friday with the sentencing
of young Russian writers to long terms
of imprisonment in Siberian labor
camps, but the one certainty is that
the underground struggle for greater
freedom was not snuffed out behind the
all-but-closed doors of the Moscow
courtroom.
The writers, principally Yuri Galans-
kov and Alexander Ginsburg, who have
been put out of the way for seven
and five years respectively, were appar-
ently accused of certain underground
literary activities, but Ginsburg in-
sisted to the last that his target was
the terrorist methods of the KGB, the
Russian security police, never the
Soviet regime. Officially, the main
accusation against the writers was of
contacts with an emigre organisation
which is openly hostile toward the
Soviet Union, and from which they
were supposed to have received money
and support. This was plainly an at-
tempt to isolate the defendants from
Russian public opinion.
Many intellectuals, and not only the
younger ones, are now in open rebellion
against the bureaucracy that limits their
freedom of expression. But most of
them see the aim of their struggle
as the reform of the regime from with-
in; they do not want to overthrow it,
and the majority of them want nothing
to do with embittered emigres.
These tactics are important, because
last week’s proceedings were nothing
like an open trial. Not only foreign
journalists were excluded; so were most
of the friends and relatives of the de-
fendants, among them people with
names famous in Russian history
descendants of the poet Yessenin, the
former Foreign Minister Litvinov, and
Yakir the military hero. The people
who protested against this legal farce
also included a retired general who,
until three years ago, used to lecture at
the Frunze military academy. These
protests are bound to embarrass the
Government. The secrecy and silence
of the Russian Press about the trial are
in themselves signs of the embarrass-
ment felt by the authorities. The
authorities may succeed in confining
the affair to a case of guilt by associa-
tion. But as Russian society becomes
increasingly sophisticated, the Govern-
ment finds it increasingly difficult to
explain why its citizens should not have
the x'ight of free expression.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The rains can’t reverse a
drop in rural output
THINGS HAVE CERTAINLY looked
up in several drought-affected areas
after last week’s rain. But for much
of southern Australia, the drought is
far from over. Not only did the rain
miss some dry parts, but in many
where some rain did fall it was far from
enough, and follow-up rains are des-
perately needed. So the latest forecast
of a 10 percent fall in rural output for
1967-68 (representing a percent drop
in output for the economy as a whole)
has not really been dented by last
week’s weather.
This is one of several important
estimates included in one of the more
enterprising forecasting efforts of Can-
berra departments, a modest publica-
tion called “Trends in Australian Rural
Production and Exports,” published
monthly by the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics. The latest issue, in out-
lining some measures of the effect of
the current southern drought, forecasts
that the overall value of rural output
will fall s34om. this financial year
from 1966-67’s record $3380m. Of the
s34om. drop, by far the largest slab
is accounted for in reduced wheat pro-
duction, down $236m. in value because
of the failure of the crop in southern
N.S.W., Victoria, and S.A. There is a
surprisingly large loss in what is often
the wheatgrower’s sideline, oats, down
from slo2m. to ssBm.
Wool production is expected to rise
marginally, lower average clips being
offset by larger numbers, and only
lower prices bring the value of pro-
duction down from sBlBm. to $762m.
The value of meat production is expec-
ted to be maintained at around sBoom.
Fortunately, the balance of payments
will not suffer the full effects of
reduced production, due to the buffer
effect of stocks. While wheat produc-
tion goes down by over $200m., wheat
exports decline by only s4Bm. But
presumably this estimate is based on a
far smaller carryover into next year,
and a large export in 1968-69 would
therefore require an extraordinarily
large crop. Overall, 1967-68 exports of
rural origin are forecast to be $ 1825 m.,
a drop of sl9om. on the year ended
June 30 last.
Japan
Lower growth, but
more exports
AUSTRALIANS KNOW more about
the prospects and problems for the
British and American economies in
1968 that they do about that of our
biggest customer Japan. This report
comes from the “Economist’s” Tokyo
correspondent:
In 1968 Japan is likely to see a lower
rate of economic growth, some squeals
about bankruptcies among some of its
medium-sized firms, but also an expan-
“The hungry sheep look up and are not fed”
sion of its exports that may curl its
competitors’ hair. In 1967 the country
had another year of fantastic expan-
sion, which' has inevitably also spilled
over into pretty fantastic over-heating
and into a need to put on the brakes.
By the autumn of 1967, Japan’s index
of manufacturing production was 22
percent higher than a year before. The
rise in real gross national product for
1967 will eventually prove to have been
well over 10 percent, spurred on by a
massive increase of nearly 30 percent
in the value of industrial investment.
Meanwhile, the balance of payments
has been bumping along in the red:
unsurprisingly so, since Japan’s imports
in the eleven months to November were
over 20 percent higher than a year be-
fore, and even Japanese exports could
not keep pace with that. On top of
this has been imposed the crisis of
rising world interest rates.
Japan’s external balance depends
quite heavily on the fact that its trad-
ing houses generally borrow abroad to
finance the country’s import and export
trade. On the rare occasions when world
interest rates rise above Japanese
domestic rates as happened in late
1966 the “yen switch” back to bor-
rowing from Japanese banks causes a
grievous turnabout in the short-term
capital account of Japan’s balance of
payments. Fortunately, in early 1967,
while the current account was going
awry, the brief attempted “international
disarmament” of interest rates sent the
“yen switch” into reverse and Japan
started to borrow abroad again.
Recognising that the “disarmament” was
not going to succeed, Japan raised its
internal bank rate on September 1,
but still hoped to avoid a severe in-
ternal squeeze.
Since then have come three blows.
One was the 8 percent bank rate with
which Britain accompanied the
devaluation of sterling; the Japanese
think that this must mean that Ameri-
can and all other world interest rates
will stay horribly high. Another blow
was a very bad set of trade figures for
November. With the tapering off of the
American and German (and British?)
recessions, Japanese businessmen assume
some commodity prices are going to
rise, so they had better re-stock; when
they do re-stock, they do it with a
vengeance, and imports have been going
through the roof.
The third blow is the reduction of
U.S. investment in Japan to 65 percent
of 1965-66 which will have a further
impact on the worsening balance of
payments (although Japan had always
kept a fairly tight reign on U.S. capital
anyway).
The result of this new atmosphere


Jo T
is that the internal squeeze in Japan
• . ,-i 1., 7- ~ . " “ ,
h V t maintained
l u s. n a coun ry w ere
everybody lives on credit, and assumes
theie will be a continual rip-roaring
boom, the hurt to some people can be
severe. Officialdom is now talking in
terms of a real growth rate of, “only”
7 or 8 percent in 1968; the year-end
to year-end rate will then be much
lower. But last week’s rise in the Jap-
anese bank rate (the second in four
months), and a realisation that it will
take more than moderately stringent
monetary and fiscal measures to stem
inflation and hold the balance of pay-
ments, suggest that there could be a
temporary setback in industrial activity
and that growth could well turn out
to be less than 7 percent in real terms,
c n u • r r .
Small businesses, a lot of them over-
borrowed; will be hit hard . Xhe bigger
and more b q U i d companies will feel
the pinc h later this spring and summer
and may then have to cut back their
investment plans,
The Japanese Government’s aim will
be to force a diversion from home
to export markets. All past evidence
suggests that it will succeed. As Japan
is now a very major industrial power
indeed, this mounting export drive is
important; it may be that the United
States and Britain, in assessments of
their own export prospects for 1968,
have not taken sufficient account of it.
World trade
Reasonably auspicious for 1968
NOT MUCH HAS BEEN heard of
them so far this year, but there are
other things apart from the fate of
dollars and sterling as reserve currencies
influencing the level of world trade
and the likely demand for Australia’s
exports. Naturally, the threat to the
two major international trading cur-
rencies, and the measures taken to pro-
tect them, have major significance for
the economic health of the world. But
how are' the world’s economies getting
along apart from this problem?
There had been forecasts, before the
U.S. dollar crisis reached a head a
fortnight ago, that, after putting up a
pretty poor performance as a whole in
1967, with a combined growth rate of
little more than two percent, the in-
dustrial countries of the world seem set
to achieve 4|- percent growth in the
next twelve months. According to the
Economist, the general tiade climate
pi onuses to be quite good. Before the
new U.S. investment restraints, the
expeits at the Pans Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment had anticipated that the dollar
value of world trade in 1968 should be
a~°ut seven peicent higher than in
1967, that is somewhat below the aver-
age growth late in recent years, but
appieciably above 1967 s five percent
growth. Prospects were not quite so
good for Britain, for markets to which
Britain sends most of its exports will
probably expand a little less fast than
others; the Economist then thought
the weighted average growth in British
export markets may be only about six
percent. 1 his is mainly because Britain
still exports quite heavily to primary
producing countries, which will have
to keep down their import bills this
next year. They have been living partly
off their reserves in the past year, and
cannot afford to continue to do so.
World trade should be helped in 1968
by a series of tariff cuts. For one thing,
the first 15 percent of the old internal
Common Market tariff will disappear in
the middle of the year. For another, on
January 1, the United States made the
first of its five annual tariff cuts under
the Kennedy Round agreements. A
few smaller countries will accompany
it, but most including Britain, Japan,
and the six Common Market countries
will make two-fifths of their agreed
cuts on July 1, then no further cuts
until January 1, 1970 (when they will
start a process of annual cuts in order
to complete the full Kennedy Round
agreement by 1972). Most countries’
full Kennedy Round cuts will average
35 to 40 percent of existing tariffs,
although for many engineering and
consumer goods they will be as big as
50 percent.
By the second half of 1968, a useful
degree of tariff-cutting should therefore
be working through the world’s in-
dustrial markets. There will be par-
ticularly heavy tariff cuts in the vital
motor-car market; the first Kennedy
Round cuts will be augmented by the
last cuts left over from an earlier round
of GATT cutting, and the car tariffs of
Britain and the Six will fall to 17.6 per-
cent from their present 25 percent.
The big question for 1968, however,
is clearly how fast re-expansion will
proceed. After a pause in the first half
of 1967, production—and, incidentally,
importing—has been picking up since
late summer in most industrial coun-
tries. The year ends with a momentum
of re-expansion under way that may
already be bigger than many people
yet realise.
One difficult question for forecasters
is to guess how governments are going
to act, once they have looked at their
balance of payments figures for the
final quarter of 1967. In the United
States, Britain, and (probably) Japan,
the governments should impose res-
traints to prevent overheating. and to
reduce balance of payments deficits; in
most countries of continental Europe,
on the other hand, they ought to go on
encouraging reflation. Unfortunately,
for some of the governments concerned,
this is just the wrong way round for
their domestic political situations, and
the U.S. has already taken external
action that reduces (it hopes) the need
to hold the economy back in a presi-
dential election year.
While President Johnson would like
to woo American businessmen by
further expansion, European business-
men cannot expect particular
encouragement from their governments
in 1968. The election season in Europe,
when concessions are given, does not
get under way for another two years.
Moreover, both Germany and France
are worried about the value-added tax,
which is being adopted throughout the
Common Market (replacing, in Ger-
many, the cascade kind of turnover
tax and, in France, a mass of small
taxes on a limited part of consumer
spending).
Nevertheless, the growth prospects for
continental Europe, and, in particular,
Germany, seemed quite good at the
turn of the year.
In addition to a significant deteriora-
tion in Germany’s balance of payments
in 1968, some deterioration should
logically be expected in the balances
of France and Italy. Fortunately, all
three can afford, temporarily anyway,
to let their reserves run down a bit.
But will France allow this to hap-
pen? At present, France is still in
need of some reflationary stimulus:
although its industrial production has
quickened a. little recently, house-build-
ing has dropped off and the labor mar-
ket goes on deteriorating, with unem-
ployment now at something like British
levels. But the French authorities are
scared on two scores: first, of the in-
creased competition from fellow mem-
bers in the Common Market after the
removal of the remaining internal tariffs
in mid-1968; and, secondly, of too great
a widening of the current deficit on the
balance of payments (which will be
worsened by the U.S. investment curbs).
Japan has already taken steps to im-
prove its external balance of payments.
At the beginning of this winter it was
stocking up on imports; but on this
side of the account there should
shortly be a slowing down. If the rate
of expansion of the Japanese economy
is slowed in 1968 to something much
nearer to a European rate, its exter-
nal balance should surely be better in
1968 than in 1967. The growth in
Japanese exports could be large.
So the swings in external accounts
that can be foreseen are not over-
ample to make room for the expected
British improvement, let alone for any
major corrective action from the
United States. And all these forecasts
assume that the United States will step
up growth again in 1968 to around
the world average —. otherwise the
anticipated growth in world exports
will not take place.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : The drought in eastern Australia
has forced a lower estimate of the gross value of farm
production in 1967-68; it may go down some 10 percent
to $3040 million and a drop of $65 million on the September
estimate; the recent rains have not yet eased the position
much . . . Wool prices have taken on some uncertainty
again, expressed, too, among fine and superfine qualities.
Australia received direct foreign investment totalling $277
million in 1966-67, a $165 million decline on the previous
year; portfolio investment and institutional loans dropped
back $42 million to $lBO million . . . The 1966-67 trading
account produced a $94 million surplus, but the balance of
payments saw a $l2O million loss, compared with 1965-66’s
$6l million gain, as a result of higher invisibles and lower
capital inflow.
For the markets S Once again nickels began to draw
feverish attention on Australian share markets; other metals
and oils were also in good demand, while industrials looked
rather stronger toward the close.
Anticipation of the Government’s economic measures left
London nervous and irregular, with many leaders giving
ground . . . Wall Street went back on the week, yet was
moving actively ahead on the Friday.
For companies: Mainly to finance Bass Strait oil and
gas developments, BHP will make its $4O million debenture
issue to shareholders and existing debenture holders, without
renounceable rights; the terms are five years percent;
seven years 6| percent, and 12 years 7 percent . . . Iron
and steel products maker John Lysaght expects the 1967
profit to be “at least as high as any in the company’s
history,” although the year’s last weeks saw slackening de-
mand which would continue over the first half of 1968; the
group is selling the N.Z. subsidiary to its U.K. parent,
Guest, Keen, and Nettlefolds . . . Sales of Commonwealth
Industrial Gases leapt 13 percent in the 1966-67 year, thus
enabling the profit uptrend . . . Leading carpet maker
Minster, however, is still suffering reduced sales and earn-
ings, so the interim is halved to 5 percent . . . Lately in the
public eye, directors of Australia Hotel Co. are recommend-
ing a new bid from developer Stocks and Holdings; L. J.
Hooker is undecided on a counter offer.
Only a small profit improvement, from $1,619,200 to
$1,654,300, came to fruit-canner and jam-maker Henry
Jones (IXL); a 28.3 percent earning rate covers the 12
percent payout . . . Flourmiller Gillespie Bros, drooped
again in its half-year (to October), yet Buttercup Bakeries
Pty., owned by Allied Mills, put earnings up by 34 percent
for its year to August last.
The Dutch aren’t laggard in sending finance here, for
Australia Netherlands Holdings is formed as a subsidiary
of the huge Nationale Nederlander insurance group to invest
some $l2 million between now and 1975; then the group
will allow an Australian shareholding . . . U.K.-owned
United Dominions sent six months’ profit (to September)
up by 16 percent, increasing its real-estate financing . . .
Developer Landmark Corporation is to be wound up.
A question mark hovers over the processing of Western
Mining Corporation’s Kambalda nickel; will the company
aim to produce finished metal and how will the money be
raised? . . . There wasn’t much doubt around King Island
Scheelite, whose profit advanced by a mere 48 percent to
$1,321,961 and divided from 48 to 60 percent.
MEN AND MATTERS
ACTUARIES ARE usually fairly con-
servative sort of fellows, so the pros-
pect of having one running the new
Australian Resources Development
Bank (and having the restraining hand
of eight bankers on his board of direc-
tors) would not normally bring much
joy to those who want to see the bank
get cracking pretty quickly in providing
the cash (inevitably at some risk) for
developing our natural resources. But
it is another matter altogether when
that actuary who got the $20,000-
$25,000-a-year general manager’s job
turns out to be R. G. (Dick) McCros-
sin, a man whose interests and experi-
ence are far wider than his professional
training.
From being an actuary with the
AMP, Dick McCrossin moved out to
get broad experience in institutional
finance, in local and international
money markets, and in merchant bank-
ing with Development Finance Cor-
poration. He has made many over-
seas visits on the international bank-
ing circuit, to New York, Montreal,
London, and Brussels. After six
months’ study in the U.S.A., he installed
the first computers at the AMP. An-
other first was a general manager of
the money-market operator Delfin Dis-
count Co. Ltd.
McCrossin’s interest in flying (he
holds a pilot’s licence, and learned
navigation and principles of flying at
night school) has taken him to many
of the sites of Australia’s mineral
developments, and in his new position
he intends to OK the finance for
ventures only after he has personally
inspected the area.
Educated at Wagga Wagga High
School and Scots College, Sydney, he
started an actuarial course by corres-
pondence, and completed the second
half in England through evening classes
at Staple Inn, given by the Institute
of Actuaries. Forty-seven next birth-
day, Dick McCrossin has two teenage
children, the son about to embark on
Commerce and Law at Melbourne
University.
THE STARS OF BANK economists
have waxed just as surely as those of
their academic brothers have waned in
recent years. The list is select; the top
ones like R. F. Holder of the Wales,
G. R. Mountain of the National, Brian
Hamlyn of the CBA, and D. H. Merry
of the ANZ have been saying sensible
things about the economy these many
years for the benefit of bank clients and
the public generally.
If there is a palm for public service
among them, Mr. Merry would be a
strong contender for it. This year the
way he has brought the Committee for
the Economic Development of Australia
out of the doldrums to become the
liveliest force in public discussion of
D. H. Merry
R. G. McCrossin
economic questions of the day is re-
markable.
Don Merry, who was born in Perth
58 years ago but has spent most of
his life in Melbourne, where he went
to Scotch (also Scots in Sydney), has
had more jobs, mostly in the finance
field, than most of his contemporaries.
A graduate in Commerce at Melbourne
University in the 1930 s (a tour de force
on the rugger field), he became one of
Sir Alfred Davidson’s elite band of
economists at the Wales, in due course
gravitating to Fiji and London in the
service of that bank and taking in the
war in various financial capacities.
Then he had a spell as finance editor
of the old Melbourne “Argus” before
getting into the Union Bank before its
merger into the ANZ with the old
Australasia.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
For every seller
there's sure
to be a buyer
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK after
reading this?—“Large selling was in
evidence at the opening bell and
gained steadily in volume and violence
throughout the morning session. At
noon a rally, dishearteningly brief, took
place as a result of short covering.
But a new selling wave soon threw the
market into utter chaos, and during
the final hour equities were thrown
overboard in huge lots, without regard
for price or value. In all, during the
day, a record 1,250,654 shares were
unloaded.”
My guess is that most investors
would think: HELP! They would get
the impression that the market had
crashed and everyone was selling out
their lot. They would be wrong. On the
very day that the 1,250,654 shares were
so feverishly flogged there was, in fact,
also some buying done. To be precise,
1,250,654 shares. This means ithat the
buyers of these shares, who, no doubt,
bought in at prices which probably
would have been considered bargains a
few days earlier, thought they were on
to a good thing. And who knows, they
might have been. The only point I’m
making is that to read or listen to only
one side of a story, even though it is
the view currently in vogue, is often
a good way of increasing your over-
draft. An unemotional and fully con-
sidered approach, which often means
running against the tide, has proved a
very profitable pastime to many people
in the past. Some of these folks now
drive Rolls-Royces.
To help earn my own Rolls I’m try-
ing ye olde formula again the for-
mula of buying cheap “penny” stocks,
that look undervalued, and then selling
them out after a rise of a few pence.
The percentage of profit made on th6se
deals always seems way out of pro-
portion to the actual money gain. For
instance, this week I’m buying Bowl-
ing Centres Holdings at 8 cents. If the
stock rises 3 cents I’ve already made
almost 40 percent profit. It would be
the same as buying BHP for $l5 and
selling it for $2l. As you may remember
BCH is an old friend of mine from
way back. Last year it made me a nice
little packet and I now think (and
hope) it’s ready to go again. I first
noticed it anew last week when I saw
that its turnover in the Sydney market
was up quite considerably and that it
had gained 1 or 2 cents. Always an
interesting situation.
The main factor that influenced me
was the company’s extremely healthy
asset position. Selling at eight cents
each, the company’s shares are backed
nearly six times over by tangible assets.
Each share is represented by 46 cents
worth of assets. And the best part is
that almost 60 percent of these assets
are made up of freehold land and build-
ings (what better assets are there?). In
fact, the company is so rich in assets
that just before Christmas, when the
assets backing was even higher, it made
arrangements to return seven cents a
share to shareholders at that time. These
were excess funds the company didn’t
even need. With the bang gone out of
bowling, and its profits small (though
a current promotional program is sup-
posedly luring players back to the
boards), the company had to rationalise
by selling or converting a few of its
buildings. Hence the liquid funds.
The final interesting feature about
this company is its board. For a 9tock
with such a weak price it’s got a mighty
strong board. First there’s Mr. L. j.
Thompson (chairman of Ampol and
APA Holdings). Then there’s more of
the Ampol team( Messrs. Leonard and
Harris, then Mr. R. Purves, the head of
Clyde Industries, then Mr. Philip from
Eagle Star Insurance, and finally Sir
Frank Packer, the boss of Australian
Consolidated Press. A formidable team
indeed. Selling at eight cents, the stock
has little chance of going down, but
looks like having several good chances
of going the other way. I went the
whole hog and bought 10,000.
This week I’ve had my New Year
sale and general clean-up of the port-
folio. I sold six stocks. Wormald earned
$24, Chamberlain lost $6, TNT made
$55, Treloar chalked up $26, Yarra
Falls came good with $4l, and Healing
added $l3 to kitty. The total result of
the lot was a profit of $159.

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
FORGET ABOUT investing; this
is a market for speculating. And the
place to do it is in the mining and
oil stocks that are bouncing around
like pogo-sticks. So far this year (all
two weeks of it), the profits that have
been made in this part of the market
are staggering: the $6.50 rise from
WMC (solidly recommended here just
before Christmas), the $2.60 lift from
Peko, the $2.20 rise in Mary Kathleen,
and the $1 lift for the new mineral
sands star, Mineral Deposits, all show
that there is a solid basis of cash carry-
ing the current boom along.
But it is in the smaller stocks that
the real money can be made and
particularly in oil. Look at what has
happened so far in the smaller mineral
companies this year: Amad almost
doubled its price before easing back
again, Cudgen rights recovered 50 per-
cent, Metals Exploration has gone up
by the same percentage,
The oils have the most appeal right
now, however, with rises of a few cents
f or SO me stocks meaning big percent-
age gains certainly far bigger gains
than you could expect from the heavier
end of the market. One of the most
interesting of these at present is Long-
reach, which has been the centre of a
lot Q f market activity so far in 1968
and a surprisingly large amount of
call option business. Last week 40,000
six-month call options costing about
$6500 were taken out in Longreach,
which is a fair-sized burst of activity
and indicates that someone is prepared
to back their view that the shares will
go to at least 85 cents by mid-year;
by early this week they had reached
70 cents, representing a rise of 22 cents
(or about 40 percent) so far in 1968.
Its attractions are not only the phos-
phate and copper interests in Queens-
land (in conjunction with Clutha and
Pechiney) but also the expectation that
shareholders will get an entitlement to
shares in the new oil float soon to
come up covering the Abrolhos Islands
area off the W.A. coast.
Another oil stock featuring in the
six-month call option list is Oil Search.
In addition to heavy turnover on
market as the price has risen from 42
to 50 cents this year, last week 40,000
calls were taken out costing about
$6OOO, to add to the 30,000-odd of the
week before. These require the stocks
to hit 66 cents before the buyer breaks
even. This looks a pretty good punt
right now. Others with attractions are
AOG, which should be bought at any
price under $2 while its rig is being
moved, AAO and, according to the
Chartist, Transoil. Others to follow
up and down are the Alliance group
and Woodside.
THE BULLETIN’S oil table will be
resumed shortly. In the meantime, here
is a summary of exploration news:
Mechanical problems at Esso-BHP’s
Kingfish B 1 have kept drilling work
at a standstill for two weeks. At 6768
feet, the well is a few hundred feet
short of the zone of interest. In the
Otway Basin, Prawn A 1 offshore was
preparing to drill ahead after setting
20-inch casing at 943 feet.
Offshore from Gladstone, AOG
abandoned its Capricorn No. la, but
has plans for another, Aquarius No. 1,
in 150 feet of water 22 miles east. In
Papuan waters, Phillips Australia® Oil
Co. plugged and abandoned Uramu
No. 1 after a strong gas flow at 6433
feet. Uramu No. la will be drilled to
evaluate its oil and gas potential.
Demand firmed for shares of Oil
Search, which has rights to areas
adjacent to this non-Australian venture.
Over in the west, Burmah’s Ashmore
Reef No. 1 supplied routine reports of
drilling ahead at 8281 feet, after casing
had been cemented to 8135 feet,
although in London rumors flew of a
strike. The Associated group plans off-
shore drilling in the Bonaparte Gulf
this year, as does the Alliance group.
Wapet’s Sandy Point No. 1, near Ex-
mouth, had reached 7969 of total depth,
of 10,000 feet. The Perth Basin offshore
well w'as scheduled to commence in the
second half of 1968.
Chasing the success of the Dara-
lingie wildcat well, Delhi-Santos was
drilling ahead at 6305 feet in Mudlalee
No. 1, 19 miles south-east of Moomba.
The Exoil-Transoil program for Mun-
yarai No. 1 w'ell brought forward
to the first quarter of 1968.
The Chartist says:
Investors who purchased oil stocks as recovery recommendations in this column
would all now be showing handsome profits to date. AOG would be the exception.
TRANSOIL N.L., which has been reproduced back to 1964, has excellent potential
and after some wide intermediate price movements between 3c and 12c during
the past two years has formed a base which suggests an ultimate target of approxi-
mately 65c. The breakout on very heavy volume in October, 1967, took prices as
high as 22c and a reaction back to 13c has since followed. Prices moved up to 19c
last week and the next target would be about the 36c level, where there would be
considerable resistance from the 1964 top formation. Last sale price on 12/1/68

Security analysis
High prices for the Piet of
frozen food makers
ALTHOUGH CLARENCE BIRDS-
EYE pioneered the quick-freezing
method of vegetable food preservation
in 1925, it was not until 1930 that the
process gained some commercial status
in the United States, and not until 1958
that the industry received recogni-
tion in Australia as being worthy of
official statistics. Since then its growth
here has been tremendous.
In Australia, the pioneer in frozen
vegetables is said to have been the
late Mr. Cahill, who commenced freez-
ing of vegetables in 1939, primarily for
his Sydney restaurants, and started
cojnmercial production for outside sales
a couple of years after the end of the
war. In 1958, the first year official
statistics were released, production of
all quick-frozen vegetables in Aus-
tralia amounted to 13.846 million
lb., equal to a per capita consumption
of 1.421 b. By 1960, the apparent
market supply (production plus im-
ports) had reached 23.633 million lb.,
equal to a per capita consumption of
2.321 b. In 1967, the apparent market
supply (production plus imports) had
jumped to 123.9 million lb., equal to a
per capita consumption of 10.61 b., and
giving an enormous 29 percent rise last
year alone in apparent consumption per
head of population.
Some gloomy clouds are around now,
with a likely short-fall in production of
peas for processing due to drought con-
ditions. In Victoria (which with Tas-
mania produces most of the Australian
pea crop for freezing purposes) the
harvest is likely to be only 30 percent
of normal this year. A lower crop
is also expected in Tasmania. In New
South Wales, where conditions are
much better, the pea crop grown for
processing is normally quite small, but
attempts are being made to increase
production this year to make up for
the overall national deficiency. There
appears to be currently a world short-
age of peas, but devaluation of the
New Zealand dollar may make the Aus-
tralian market sufficiently attractive for
supplies of New Zealand frozen peas to
be sold here in greater quantities this
year. The Australian bean crop is not
expected to suffer greatly from the
drought overall, except in Victoria,
where supplies will be very much
reduced.
Compared to the Australian esti-
mated per capita consumption of quick-
frozen vegetables —10.61 b. in 1967
the U.S. per capita consumption is
over 151 b. Australians are still not quite
as conscious of convenience foods as
are the Americans, and the fact remains
that Australians can get most fresh vege-
tables all the year round. Another
factor limiting the overall per capita
consumption in Australia is the result
of a very slow growth in demand for
frozen potato products.
Potato products represent over 40
percent of total frozen vegetable con-
sumption in the U.S.A., compared to
about 13 percent for peas and about
seven percent for green beans. In Aus-
tralia, by comparison, frozen peas
represent about 67 percent of the total
frozen-vegetable consumption, compared
to about 15 percent for beans and a
very negligible percentage for potato
products. Frozen potato products are
too dear in Australia compared with
fresh potatoes; there are technical prob-
lems in producing a completely accept-
able quality product still to be ironed
out, while the pendulmen-swings in
market price fluctuations of potatoes
make the whole subject a bit of a
headache in organising farmers into
large-scale contract growing.
In frozen peas, the Australian esti-
mated consumption of 71b. per head of
population is approximately comparable
with the U.S. per capita consumption
rate, although it is significantly lower
than the 111 b. per capita rate in New
Zealand. Possibly up to 40 percent of
the annual fresh pea crop in Australia
and just over 20 percent of the bean
crop is now processed into quick-frozen
vegetables.
In the production and processing of
peas for freezing, a number of major
developments have occurred. The first
was the use of a standard-grade pea
for growing. The quality of peas is
bound up with maturity. The ideal
is to harvest mechanically at a time
when maximum yield can be obtained
in terms of optimum maturity. Unfor-
tunately, the standard-grade pea grown
for freezing in Australia has an “off
flavor,” compared with the flavor of the
old garden variety. A lot of work is
being done to improve the flavor, but
there is still a long way to go. In
the factory sequence, peas are washed,
graded, blanched, then frozen usually
before packaging. A few years ago,
the universal method of processing was
in the use of air-blast freezing, but a
new method has been introduced called
fluidised bed freezing, which cuts down
the freezing time from 30 minutes to 5
minutes. The Petersville group is un-
derstood to be the only major company
in the industry to retain the older air-
blast freezing system, which puts them
at somewhat of a disadvantage.
Piet Ltd. is the only major company
in the industry to specialise exclusively
in frozen foods. Petersville Australia
Ltd. may be the overall market leader
in frozen foods, but they make many
other products besides. A similar situa-
tion exists with Henry Jones (IXL)
Ltd. and with the British Tobacco
group. Piet started life in 1950 as a
pre-packer of fresh vegetables and in
1951 commenced to produce quick-
frozen vegetables. The major break-
through came in 1963, when a new
plant was installed at Notting Hill
(Melbourne) which has been described
by a non-Pict expert as being the best
frozen-vegetable food plant in Austra-
lia. Another modern factory was estab-
lished at Glen Innes in Northern New
South Wales.
In 1964 the company listed on the
Melbourne Exchange and three years
later took over the business of its Syd-
ney agent and commenced its own
direct distribution in the Sydney area.
It is rumored that Piet might shortly
open a processing plant in the
Deloraine area of Northern Tasmania,,
which would give them added strength
and manoeuvrability in the processing
and freezing of peas.
Piet claims to be the first company

whilst total assets accelerated by 123.5
percent, pre-tax profit by 55.4 percent,
and net profit after tax by 57.3 percent.
With an industry growth of over 20
percent per annum, it is difficult for a
company such as Piet to match its asset
growth by commensurate increases in
profits.
A note of disappointment is the slow
growth in earnings per share, up only
7.8 percent over the three years 1964-
1967. With a possible short-fall in pro-
duction due to the drought, Piet may
probably find difficulty in maintaining
profits in 1968 at the 1967 record level.
With a dividend yield of 4.6 percent,
the shares, currently at $1.75, are selling
for the equivalent of 11.4 year’s earn-
ings. A price/earnings multiple of 11
plus would not normally be too high to
pay for a company such as Piet in a
growth-plus industry, but with drought
clouds around, the price seems to be too
high at this moment of time.
SUMMING UP: Piet impresses as
the company with “that something
extra” to contribute in the frozen foods
industry. In the long term, investors
should make substantial gains. In the
short term, investors could wait until
the interim profit and dividend an-
nouncement before making a share
decision. At a lower market price the
shares could make attractive buying.

Behind the balance sheets
AWA’s very “subdued” profits
IT HAS BEEN a deadly dull stock for
the past five years, and judging by the
company’s own view of its prospects
Amalgamated . Wireless (Australasia)
Ltd. is going to be dull for a couple
more years yet. Its directors expect
profits will be subdued for another two
years at least; then they expect an
upturn in activities due to new tech-
niques and new fields for expansion in
electronics. So those investors who may
have hoped that the increasing level of
defence orders going to the Australian
electronics industry, or the restoration
of some degree of order into the appli-
ance business following the demise of
some of its more disastrous retailers,
would have brought some early benefits
to AWA, may have to wait for their
eventual reward, meantime earning the
modest dividend income of 3.8 percent
(about half the earnings yield—and
about half what could be earned from
a good quality debenture).
In the end, the patience of those
investors who have held this stock
for so long for so little may pay
off, but there seems no need for
those who want to share in the good
things that could come from AWA to
rush in; there should be plenty of
opportunities of getting the shares
(which are good quality) at or even a
little below the current price of $2.10 —
particularly if the widely expected
shortage of liquidity develops later this
year and affects stockmarket prices in
general. In any event, even if things
do improve at a better rate than direc-
tors thought last month, it will be
several months before they make their
next report to shareholders.
There is no doubt about the need
for significant improvement in AWA’s
profit performance before its share price
could justify any sort of healthy rise.
For the company’s profits have been
more than “subdued” in recent years;
they have been steadily declining,
according to conventional accountancy
norms, as the steady rises reported by
the company involve accounting atti-
tudes that are not shared by most
practitioners. In effect, AWA has been
getting it both ways in reporting a
30 percent rise in profits since 1963;
using normal accounting principles, this
turns into a decline of 25 percent (with
the profit as seen by the Taxation Com-
missioner dropping by 33 percent in
the past two years subject to
unknown changes in the amount of
investment allowances deducted from
taxable income).
The company may well be justified
by events in adopting the different
accounting approach that produces
such an altered result, but it is unusual.
For the normal accounting principle is
that any definite liability in the foresee-
able future is a charge against profits,
and should be removed “above the
line” before stating profit for the year.
Items transferred to reserves after
stating profits (“below the line”) may
go to creating funds for unknown con-
tingencies. So items deducted “above
the line” go into “liabilities” in the
balance sheet; those “below” go into
“reserves.” In AWA’s case, however,
some items deducted “below the line”
appear in “liabilities” in the balance
sheet, suggesting that they should
properly have been deducted before
profit was arrived at. In our adjusted
table we have made that change
The company differentiates between
provisions and reserves on the basis that
provisions are certain requirements in
the near future, reserves are long dist-
ance and uncertain. But the company
does not make the same distinction in
the profit and loss account. Long-ser-

vice leave, for instance, received an
appropriation in the year to June 30,
1967, of $lOO,OOO, in recognition of
changing legislation and altered awards.
But there are other problems. One item
very properly charged against profits
represented “amounts set aside to pro-
visions other than for depreciation,
renewals or diminution in value of
assets” and is explained as covering
some long-service leave obligations and
plant replacement (where there have
been technical changes). This was only
$62,000 in 1967, but has been as high
as $Jm. in recent years, and movements
of such magnitude seem to deserve
some elaboration in the annual report,
as they clearly affect profits quite con-
siderably.
At the same time the company has
appropriated “below the line” $350,000
in the past two years for rearrangement
arising from the transfer of works which
it recognises as a short-term obligation,
and therefore appears in the balance
sheet as a current liability.
AWA has difficulty in distinguishing
between research and development. It
has one laboratory doing fundamental
research, and at least two others doing
more development or applied research.
While holding licensing agreements with
Radio Corporation of America, Mar-
coni and Telefunken, its management
feels strongly that Australia cannot
afford to be a nation of tenants. It esti-
mates AWA spends more on research-
cum-development in relation to turn-
over than its counterparts overseas. An
appropriation which the company
makes for research and development
($1 million in 1964 and $669,000 in
1967), appearing in the balance sheet
as a liability, might more accurately
have been a provision charged against
profits. However, the appropriation for
commercial development and television
is quite correctly made “below the line”
and represents part of shareholders*
funds. Expenditure in 1966-67 charged
to research and special developments
accounts created for this purpose from
previous appropriations apparently
amounted to about $300,000, reducing
the liability for taxation by perhaps
$135,000. Other tax relief was obtained
from the greater investment allowance
on manufacturing plant. If the appro-
priations which the company has made
in the past five years (except for com-
mercial development and TV, and to
general reserve) had been made as
charges against profits, the results (see
the table “Adjustment of AWA profits”)
would have shown a much more vari-
able trend. Apart from the adjust-
ments in the clearcut cases of transfer
of works and long-service leave, these
adjusted results possibly are no closer
to the real trading position than the
company’s official results. The solu-
tion for the company may be to charge
research and development costs when
the expenditure is incurred. Despite
the group’s unusual accounting, reserves
have been built up, amounting to 70
percent of shareholders’ funds.
Expenditure is required to prepare
for expanding horizons (although group
commitments for capital expenditure
at 1967 balance date were a nominal
$61,550), so the company is likely to
continue stowing away substantial sums
to reserves, by orthodox or unorthodox
means, and seems committed to a steady
16 percent dividend, the rate re-
established in 1963.
In expecting AWA’s activities to pick
up in a couple of years’ time, directors-
have in mind the advent of color tele-
vision, still at least three years away r
the possible introduction of frequency
modulation broadcasting, over which
the Commonwealth Government is still
vacillating, and such developments as
integrated circuitry (to reduce the size
of electronic equipment, such as com-
puters of desk size) and the use of
satellite communications. The chairman
(Sir Lionel Hooke) is optimistic about

white, so the economics are not good
for our small and scattered population.
The group’s business falls more or
less evenly into engineering products
and consumer products, though in cur-
rent conditions of defence contracts for
the former, and dampened demand for
the latter, the scale may be tipped
60-40. Business is sensitive not only to
defence spending decisions but to the
state of consumer spending. In TV
there has been intense competition and
price cutting for at least the past five
years of excess productive capacity, but
the company has tended to miss busi-
ness rather than risk bad debts. But
homes are now getting their second
and third TV sets, radio is booming,
and there is a swing to music.
The service division at Leichhardt,
mainly for engineering products, is de-
veloping. It handles major overhauls for
radio on virtually every ship on the
Australian register (and its operation
and maintenance), major overhaul of
aircraft equipment (and maintenance in
the field), services two-way radio com-
munications (police, ambulance, etc.),
and equipment for the Army and other
services’ tracking stations.
During the year to Jupe, 1967, AWA
moved into a new s3m. factory for
engineering products (transmitters,
sophisticated receivers, traffic signals,
and two-way communications) on a
25-acre site at North Ryde. This en-
abled concentration of major activities
in self-contained units, which will im-
prove efficiency and profits, but not
noticeably for a year or two. The other
manufacturing units, all in N.S.W., are
the modernised Ashfield works which
make, sell, and distribute consumer
products (TV, radio, and radiogram
sets), and mass-produced items such as
public-address systems and telephones
(a nice bread-and-butter line); the
cabinet-making division of Strong
Products, now wholly owned; and the
valve company at Rydalmere, making
receiving and transmitting valves,
transistors for entertainment and com-
mercial purposes, and TV picture
tubes.
Sir Lionel believes a strong home
market is necessary for Australian com-

panies -to build up exports. AWA may
have to become more selective, in the
items it manufactures for export. It
cannot compete on mass-production
lines, but where products have a high
engineering content with little tooling
(such as TV transmitters), AWA can
compete and has won Singapore con-
tracts against Japan.
AWA has a stake in broadcasting
stations in eight areas, as it used to
buy shares in stations to which it had
sold transmitters. An 11 percent in-
terest in United Telecasters Sydney,
costing $500,000, and with a market
value now slightly above cost, has no
immediate prospect of contributing to
AWA profits.
There have been no capital benefits
since the one-for-one bonus in 1956,
the company’s TV heyday, and the
company has no appetite for capital
(only last year did it have to resort
to long-term borrowings of sljm. in
connection with the Ryde factory). So
shareholders are unlikely to see any
capital growth for some time, And
the dividend looks pretty steady, too.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Following a vivid flirtation with uranium issues, the markets
have excitedly returned to their old nickel favorites; some of
the glow has also been transformed to a few other metals and
oils, while industrials took some improvement as well. Western
Mining finished at $34.80 for a net $4.90 advance, after having
hit a peak $36.20; Great Boulder, actually ex rights, put on
40 cents to close at $6.70, with the rights, $3.20, at $1.20
above their theoretical value. Peko added another 78 cents
and Mount Morgan 80 cents. King Island Scheelite went up
86 cents to $5.66. BHP gained 30 cents, reaching $16.25.

THE LAND
Agrisearch
Practice must catch up theory
JANUARY IS FOR taking stock. It is
the month when we straighten our
backs, lift our heads, and look broadly
at our affairs. It is the time when we
are supposed to make new resolutions.
A restrospective glance through this
column over the past year leaves one
with a comfortable feeling that agri-
cultural research is well tooled up in
this country to solve specific problems.
Indeed, so much technical information
has been accumulated in some fields
that electronic computers are needed
to structure it into some semblance of
order and meaning. One success seems
to have engendered another, as if the
scientists simply have had to turn a
handle to keep cranking out new snip-
pets of knowledge to fit into hosts of
jigsaw puzzles. With more scientists
and more laboratories we could no
doubt obtain more pieces of informa-
tion more rapidly, and perhaps even
complete portions of some of the
puzzles. But then there is the occasional
gloom-painter who pictures us drown-
ing in a morass of data.
Things may not be as menacing as
that, but we have certainly arrived at
the point where our knowledge vastly
outstrips our performance. In other
words, we have succeeded in building
up our agricultural potential until it is
far beyond our actual productivity.
Over the past several months these col-
umns have described advances or re-
counted informed opinion that promise
the capacity of doubling, trebling, and
even quadrupling the harvests of such
major products as wool, cotton, wheat,
other coarse grains, meats, milk, eggs,
fruit, and vegetables.
In viewing the future of Australian
agriculture we begin, therefore, from a
position of great strength. From the
standpoint of the international scene,
with its exploding population, it seems
that we are poised to pull more than
our fair share of the weight. Although
the experts are still arguing over the
present state of the world’s food needs
largely because they cannot agree
on how much of which food constitutes
an adequate standard of nutrition for
a person it can be taken that calorie
production is barely sufficient at the
moment and that protein production
falls short by about 25 percent. Apply-
ing the same standards as were used
for making this estimation, and taking
account of the existing rate of increase
of mouths, by the year 2000 total food
production of all types must expand by
rather more than 150 percent and pro-
tein by over 200 percent.
We in Australia, as pointed out,
already have the theoretical knowhow
easily to keep pace with this schedule.
Whether we have the social, economic,
and organisational knowledge to carry
it out is another matter entirely. Most
of us in agriculture are aghast at the
immensity of the task of actually turn-
ing our knowledge into twice as many
haunches of beef, bags of wheat, and
so on. How the greater part of the
rest of the world is going to keep its
end up, God alone knows. Agricul-
turists are firmly convinced that
population suppression is not merely
desirable, but mandatory, if humanity
is not to sink into ever more brutish
depths. There are already 3000 million
to feed and this number will have
nearly doubled by the turn of the
century, even assuming that birth con-
trol becomes widely practised. What-
ever new scientific discoveries await, it
is beyond human imagination to see
food enough growing in the fields and
pens for more than three times the
present population a figure that
could be reached during the lifetime
of our great-grandchildren unless the
birth rate is stabilised in the meantime.
Even in our relatively enlightened
country it is not at all clear what
practical steps could be taken toward
translating potential agricultural yields
into harvests, assuming that we want
to help in alleviating the world’s food
crisis. This process seems to involve a
far greater range of skills than our
agricultural scientists have exercised up
to date. Their orientation toward
specialisation no doubt explains their
remarkable successes in breeding im-
proved varieties, finding trace elements,
or formulating effective vaccines. But
confronted with the need to get results
into practice, their first resolve for the
New Year could be to enlist the aid
of more sciences and more people en-
compassing a comprehensive range of
arts and skills. Agriculture is after all
an integrative enterprise. Biologists
alone are simply not enough. Psy-
chologists, sociologists, and great num-
bers of teachers must be brought into
the campaign. Agricultural science has
already made very fruitful contact with
economists and is beginning to take
notice of programmers and work-
efficiency experts, which suggests that
the profession is at least open-minded.
The old attitude that research will solve
problems of production automatically
by simply announcing the results of
experiments has proved to be naive.
During the coming year the pro-
fession might set itself another goal
that of broadening its interests and
activities generally. The influences of
agriculture have now far passed the
old battle lines of production and
marketing. Farmers and townsmen are
beginning to clash over the use of
water. Towns and their appurtenances
are cutting into agricultural land. Agri-
cultural chemicals are contaminating
food. Hydroelectric schemes are destroy-
ing the habitat of wildlife. Which area
should be developed for cotton with the
city worker’s taxes? Members of the
profession might begin to provide some
leadership in all such considerations if
they stopped calling themselves agri-
cultural scientists and started seeing
themselves as natural-resource or en-
vironmental scientists. This feeble step
could eventually become the bridge
joining town and country and over
which might pour the pent-up skills of
urban people anxious about the funda-
mental sources of their welfare.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Shapcott focuses on Blackman
By ELWYN LYNN
Focus on Gharles Blackman. Thomas
Shapcott. University of Queensland
Press. $5.95.
THOMAS SHAPCOTT’S is the second
book on 35-year-old Charles Blackman;
it springs from St. Lucia’s desire to
bless her native sons, Blackman hav-
ing been born in Sydney and having
lived for a time in Brisbane.
The first book in 1965 by another
poet, Ray Mathew, in the defunct
Georgian House Monograph series,
complements Shapcott’s book with a
detailed bibliography and a long list
of works, but Mathew’s introduction
merely suggested the themes of blind-
ness and how sexuality is usually dif-
fused into sensuality. Shapcott has more
space to start a lot of hares.
Shapcott follows quite closely the
procedure outlined for the series that
has a lively and perceptive Dennis
Pryor on the potter, Milton Moon,
W. N. Scott on Judith Wright and is to
have others on Andrew Sibley and Jon
Molvig. The books are not intended to
be critical analyses, but are a sympath-
etic and sensitive friend’s framework of
reference constructed from tapes, com-
ments, and criticism. Well, at least, the
authors are not expected to do the
tough critical bit to show they have
elevated standards.
Despite all we have read about the
intentionalist fallacy, the creative per-
son is still his own privileged witness;
Blackman, like others who move among
images of experience, has an ahistorical
approach; at times Shapcott’s tape flows
like the stream of consciousness and
Blackman flies like a bird over the
waters of his creation, wherein he is
reflected once again, while the historian
sloshes away in his necessary but un-
inspiring dredge.
Mr. Shapcott could have dammed
the stream occasionally, for it glides too
smoothly around such issues as London
influences or the 1959 Antipodean
Manifesto (Shapcott and Mathew quote
the same six or so lines from it),
which Blackman interprets as Dr.
Smith’s and the other Antipodeans’ re-
action to Sydney’s alleged dismissal of
figurative painting. (Actually it’s all
about Melbourne’s dismissal of abstrac-
tion.) One would expect this area to be
well charted, because Dr. Smith made
a point in his “Australian Painting”
that in 1959 John Reed’s collection of
Melbourne figurative painters was dis-
missed in Sydney, a fact that must
have sharpened attitudes in the Mani-
festo. Now Blackman had a show in
Sydney in July, 1958; it was reason-
ably well received by the critics, though
Douglas Stewart (another poet!) des-
cribed the heads as “sinister ‘golli-
wogs.’ ” This may not be important,
but the Manifesto, an alarmist grotes-
querie in itself, is more important in
Australian art than Blackman and
Shapcott allow and certainly im-
portant for Blackman’s relation to the
other seven signatories.
The fact is that an Antipodean Hero
showed in Sydney a year before the
Manifesto, was not peppered with shot,
and was bought by the (then) National
Gallery of N.S.W.
It is impossible to select criticism
without taking a critical, and some-
times uncritical, stance, though Shap-
cott usually employs his quotations to
illuminate and reinforce his account,
but in a source book one would prefer
a complete piece of criticism rather
than snippets, however exemplary
they might be; for example, the whole
of the short “Meanjin” piece of 1952,
by Alan McCulloch (quoted so often
that the book could be about his critical
development), is more important than
Bryan Robertson’s catalogue introduc-
tion, because, even if it is a discerning,
London opinion, all introductions are a
little suspect, especially when Shapcott
says, “Robertson can afford to be wholly
enthusiastic because he knows.” (Not
my italics.)
If one feels dissatisfied in a number
of areas Blackman’s association with
the Percevals, the Boyds, the Reeds,
and the Moras and why four years
lapsed between his 1957 and 1961 ex-
hibitions in Melbourne it’s an enter-
taining book with relevant gossip mixed
with poetic evocations, assisted by a
legion of poets; Shapcott quotes Judith
Wright, Barbara Blackman, Yeats,
Mathew, Sanburg, Francis Webb, and
Shaw Neilson. Mathew made do with
Neilson. I hear that it is a poet who
will write on Andrew Sibley, but I
wonder if this poetic takeover is the
answer to the dreariness of historical
art-prose.
The 16 color and 19 black-and-white
plates are excellent; sensibly described
and interpreted by Shapcott, they de-
fine Blackman’s approach, summed up
in his remarks on the effect of London
upon him ... “I could fit my creative
cycle into a prescribed area you
condition yourself to doing this, as
against doing something for yourself
and then only showing when you’ve
done it. Sort of semi-professional
activity, I suppose; it seems to fit my
personality, in a kind of way, because
it seems to me that it spurs you to do
something different.”
I think that is closer to the Mel-
burnian approach to alien influences
than the Manifesto, which was simply
polemical; the best of the Antipodeans,
like Blackman, were, to use that loose
term, poetic.
Jazz
Harmony in Hobart
By TOM PICKERING
“HAVEN’T WE HAD enough this
year? Bushfires, drought, and power
cuts, and now 300 hairy jazz players.”
This was how the local Press greeted
the 22nd Australian Jazz Convention as
it began its six-day run in Hobart.
Delegates to the convention have
become resigned to newspaper reports
which emphasise the occasional eccen-
tricities of dress and other relatively
unimportant but colorful aspects of
the event, but never before have they
experienced such direct rudeness. The
statement was particularly irresponsible
considering Tasmania’s tourist ambi-
tions. But this sour opening note did
little to disrupt the harmony of the
jazzmen and enthusiasts from five States
as they proceeded, in a series of eight
concerts at the Repertory Theatre’s
Playhouse, to blast Hobart out of its
post-Christmas lethargy.
At Melbourne and Sydney conven-
tions in recent years, with upward of
80 bands clamoring to perform and
audiences of thousands, a certain
amount of informality and intimacy
has been lost. To a large extent, this
was regained in Hobart; there were
fewer bands (28), less numerous but
more dedicated audiences, and, in the
smaller community, more intermingling.
Interchanging of people was more pre-
valent and pick-up groups frequently
contained musicians from several
States. The ages of those playing
ranged from 16 to 50; there were two
instances of father and son playing in
the same band, while some, in their
twenties at the first convention, are
now grandfathers, still blowing strong,
if courting coronaries.
Although the prevailing sound was
that of the accepted Traditional line-
up, complete with the often monoton-
ous and limiting banjo and brass bass,
there was evidence of a broader out-
look developing. It seems unlikely now
that the convention will ever accept


the Modernists, but a session of Elling-
ton tunes arranged by lan Pearce and
played by his sextet was a refreshing
oasis, as was a boppish bracket by a
well-rehearsed Launceston band. These
and other performances which leaned
toward Chicago and Mainstream styles
were enthusiastically received and pro-
vided some relief from the rather hide-
bound revivalist conception of New
Orleans jazz that generally dominates
conventions.
Besides the Playhouse, sessions and a
well-attended public concert at the
Hobart City Hall, the program included
several symposiums and jazz-accom-
panied Social functions at various
venues: a country barbecue; a street
parade; a Jazz and jug afternoon at a
suburban hotel; and a New Year’s Eve
riverboat trip. A bizarre note was struck
with a trip to Port Arthur.
The several groups in which reed-
man Major Lockie Thomson was the
guiding light played with the most con-
sistent verve and precision, while
Marice Garbutt, with his Yarra Yarra
Jazz Band, gave an object lesson in
presentation. Other bands which earned
a place in the final concert were: The
Silver Leaf Ragtime Band (Vic.), Nick
Polites’ Jazz Band (Vic.), The Rank-
In-Siders (S.A.), The Jazzmakers
(Vic.), Geoff Bull’s Jazz Band
(N.S.W.), Tom Pickering’s Good Time
jazz Band (Tas.), The Hot Sands Jazz
Band (Vic.), and John Roberts’ Capital
Jazz Band (A.C.T.).
Brief mention must also be made of
Mai Jennings, a 23-year-old trumpeter
from Ballarat who, although he has
attracted attention at previous con-
ventions, achieved full stature at this
one and earned the approbation of
both fellow-musicians and audiences
with his powerful lyrical playing. One
was also struck by the number of fine
trombonists present, all partially
eclipsed in one inspired riverboat per-
formance by Adelaide’s Dave Rankin,
in which he did everything but stand
on his head and tie his slide in knots.
Films
Love and luv
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Divorce American Style. Director, Bud
Yorkin.
Luv. Director, Clive Donner.
You Only Live Twice. Director, Lewis
Gilbert.
THE FIRST TWO movies on the list
have practically interchangeable titles,
since both are about bickering couples
who get divorced, fight over property
settlements, try to interest themselves
in other partners, and finally decide
they prefer each other after all. In fact,
they should really change names, since
“Divorce American Style” is a lot more
about love, however you want to spell
it, than the other curiously unpleasant
film.
In fact, an excess of sunny optimism
which keeps interrupting its often
sharply sardonic comments is the chief
fault of “Divorce American Style,”
which is an amiable and often funny
film which never succeeds in being
quite as biting a social comment as it
hopes to be. Anyone who has ever been
to a Hollywood romantic comedy knows
perfectly well that Dick Van Dyke and
Debbie Reynolds really love each other
and will get back together in the end
though the film does have enough
honesty to show them settling comfort-
ably back into their domestic
squabbling.
The best sequence, a beautifully con-
trolled bit of visual comedy, is ithe long,
wordless scene in which the disgruntled
couple go through the routine of pre-
paring for bed, getting in each other’s
way and on each other’s nerves. But
director Yorkin often becomes undisci-
plined, as in the sequence where much-
divorced parents try to sort out the
children of various marriages or in the
overlong scene in which the wife con-
fesses her love for ex-husband when
under hypnosis in a nightclub - surely
a stroke of sheer desperation on the
scriptwriter’s part.
“Luv,” on the other hand, is a sour
and cynical film about people for whom
one can’t feel any trace of sympathy.
The script does have occasional gleams
of wit probably survivors from
Murray Schisgal’s original play and
Elaine May and Peter Falk are a comi-
cal pair. Jack Lemmon, quite out-
classed, plays his role with an unattrac-
tive, slack-jawed unease. And Clive
Donner’s direction is wild, almost hys-
terical. Whatever became of the style
and flair he showed in “Nothing But
the Best”?
After all this domestic discord
why do Americans persist in getting
married when it’s so unpleasant? it’s
a relief to turn to a. James Bond film,
in which you can be pretty certain there
will be no marrying or giving in mar-
riage. But wonder of wonders, Bond
does go through a form of marriage in
“You Only Live Twice” but it isn’t
really binding (he’s improbably dis-
guised as a Japanese fisherman at the
time), and his bride uses this legal
technicality to avoid consummating the
marriage.
Still, there are plenty of easier-going
girls about, and Bond plays alternating
scenes of sex and mayhem with slick
expertise. But there are signs that the
mixture as before is losing its potency.
The plot might have come out of a
computer; the dialogue lacks its usual
macabre humor; and once or twice the
camera catches Sean Connery off guard
looking bored and elderly. Still, you
certainly can’t call it dull. As with all
this series, there’s too much going on
for that.
Theatre
Documentary
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Investigation. Peter Weiss. Inde-
pendent, Sydney.
THERE’S a good deal of moral pres-
sure on any member of the audience to
praise a play which deals with un-
exceptionable rectitude with a subject
like the atrocities of the Nazi exter-
mination camps. You’re horrified and
sickened by the facts, almost unbeliev-
able yet undeniably true; any criticism
of the actual dramatic value of the
play is automatically stigmatised as
flippant, irrelevant, and unfeeling.
Especially when the actual occurrence
is comparatively recent.
I don’t imagine that any such cal-
culating notions entered into the mind
of Peter Weiss when he wrote “The
Investigation.” Indeed he gives the
impression of desperate sincerity, and
his documentary, or oratorio in 11
cantos, to quote his own description,,
came across quite effectively on radio.
What he has totally failed to do is to
write a play, a production that works
on the stage.
The three lawyers—judge, prosecu-
cutor, and defender —sit at the sides
of the stage; the witnesses stand in
the middle addressing themselves
direotly to the audience; the accused
sit in the first row of the stalls, risings
occasionally to refute the witnesses’
testimony. This presumably is to make
them “faceless men,” like the half-
masks worn by the witnesses but
since these are transparent they leave
the actors perfectly recognisable while
giving them a distracting resemblance
to cicadas. A screen at the back
periodically shows stills of the horrors
of concentration camps and at the end
pictures of atrocities in Vietnam, race
riots, and other contemporary violence.
But despite this implied warning,
there is no real dramatic development
in the play. The witnesses content
themselves with a recital of (admit-
tedly terrible) facts; the accused either
deny categorically or excuse them-
selves by reference to duty and follow-
ing orders. There is no hint of the
effect of the happenings not only on
the prisoners but on their torturers, on
the judges, on the world which only
heard later what had been going on.
In the circumstances one can’t blame
the actors, who deliver their lines with
glib professionalism but without feel-
ing, for giving little immediacy or
reality to the play.
In his indictment of the torturers,
Weiss’ indignation allows him to give
them no gleam of recognisable
humanity—they are presented as mon-
sters. But, Herr Weiss, they weren’t—
they were human beings. And that
makes them and us worse, and
(if you’d faced the fact) would have
made the play better.

Art
Benefits of the
Biennale
By ELWYN LYNN
ONCE AGAIN it seems that Australia
will not be represented at Venice’s
Biennale, that great assemblage of
modern art that began in 1895 and in
1966 opened with over 3000 works from
37 countries, including Iran, Israel,
Iceland, Cuba, Ecuador, and Egypt, but
not Australia; 1966 prizewinners came
from Argentina with a population of 20
million and Denmark with five million.
Chauvinism is undoubtedy a motive
behind much representation, but it only
really shows in the art from the USSR,
because any great international exhibi-
tion, like the Carnegie at Pittsburgh
or the Bienal at Sao Paulo, reveals that
art is global and bears none of the
qualities attached to any geographical
centre and few, if any, of its place
of origin.
Australia has officially participated
twice only once in 1954 and again
in 1958, when works by Sir Arthur
Streeton, who had died in 1943 and
thus was accorded an honor given only
to recently deceased, famous interna-
tional figures, and Arthur Boyd were
shown; Boyd’s works were earlier pieces,
and the irony of such misrepresentation
was underlined by the fact that I saw
his splendid Half-Caste Bride series,
central to his work and essential for
understanding of 1958 Melburnian
mythologising, at David Jones’, just
before I saw his much less impressive
works in Venice.
Australian representation in Venice
is the responsibility of the Common-
wealth Art Advisory Board in the
Prime Minister’s Department; now
comprising Sir Daryl Lindsay, Robert
Campbell, William Dargie, Douglas
Pratt, and Russell Drysdale, it has not
been a body noted for enthusiasm for
modern art, and its present mellow in-
difference should not be mistaken for
tolerance. The trouble is that Venice
issues invitations to participate only to
Sir Daryl Lindsay ... “mellow indif-
ference”
governments, and the CAAB has not
been inclined to delegate authority as
the U.S. Government has to the Gug-
genheim, the Metropolitan, and the
Smithsonian Institute, and the British
Government to the Arts Council. The
Contemporary Art Society of N.S.W.,
having ascertained from Venice that
Australia, had been invited for the 1968
Biennale (the Board never announces
the receipt of such invitations or its
refusal of them), asked the Board, on
October 24, 1967, whether it would
delegate authority; on December 14
the Board pointed out that “it is likely
that the Council for the Australian
National Gallery will be appointed in
the near future, which will undertake,
among other things, the co-ordination
of exhibitions of Australian art going
overseas. In these circumstances the
Board is unable to commit the Council
to giving support to representation at
the Biennale.”
I can sympathise with the Board’s
added reasons for non-participation, but
I doubt if any effective machinery will
be devised to cope with such represen-
tation. Might not a committee from Dr.
Coombs’ Art Council be better than
members of the National Gallery
Council and its staff? Councils and
trustees are usually appointed for their
administrative skill (rarely involving
the skill of delegation, however) rather
than their commitment to the experi-
mental in art, and to use the staff of
a national gallery as sole selectors for
overseas shows would be too narrow a
practice. The U.S. practice of selecting
an institution which gives sole authority
to one man, or the U.K. practice of
relying on a committee that is not
attached to galleries or museums have
much to commend them. Let’s hope that
National Gallery Council will appoint
a co-ordinator who will travel to Venice
as commissioner for the 1970 Biennale;
the commissioner for the 1958 Biennale
was then living in Italy and, seeing the
exhibition sent from Australia, cabled
a Sydney friend to collect slides to show
that Australian artists had heard of the
20th century.
People who ask why Australia should
participate might direct that question
to the 37 countries involved in 1966;
the idea that Australia should only par-
ticipate if she can show something dis-
tinctly Australian leads to mere chauvin-
ism, especially as we have entered an
era of simultaneity in art changes which
are less and less affected by indigenous
modes.
It is not the fate or influence of the
Australian works at Venice that is so
important as the effects of a good selec-
tion on local thinking about art; it can
have a tonic effect, crystallise thinking,
arouse rewarding debate, and give art
a new ambience by lifting it out of the
grasp of dealers and institutions.
* Ironic footnote: among the kinetic
works purchased by the Power Institute
is one by Le Parc, one of the prize-
winners at the 1966 Biennale.


BOOKS
The Labor leader who despised
the Labor Party
By PETER COLEMAN
Evatt the Enigma. Allan Dalziel. Lans-
downe Press. $5.50.
FEW MEN IN THE world are better
placed to write a memoir of the late
Dr. H. V. Evatt than Allan Dalziel,
his secretary, adviser, (often quarrel-
ling) friend, and for all practical pur-
poses the real Member for Barton, dur-
ing Dr. Evatt’s years in Federal politics.
Few men in Australian politics espoused
Dr. Evatt’s political outlook with Dal-
ziel’s intensity indeed Dalziel prob-
ably endorsed it with even more in-
tensity than Evatt himself. He, for ex-
ample, with his strong anti-Catholicism
evident on page after page of this
book, could not go along with him
when Evatt was wooing Mr. Santa-
maria’s followers in the years before
the Labor Party split—and in these
memoirs he tells how uneasy he con-
sidered Evatt to have been in their
company.
How deep an influence Dalziel’s
strong personality, his religious con-
victions, and his leftist commitments
had on Evatt at crucial stages is one
of the absorbing questions we look to
Kylie Tennant to explore in her pro-
jected biography of Evatt. Although the
theme of this memoir is the “enigmas”
of Evatt’s life as seen by Dalziel, it also
serves to illuminate this enigma of Dal-
ziel’s public life -- especially in the
light of the coolness shown to Evatt at
various times in this book.
As for the Evatt “enigmas,” one of
them that Dalziel outlines—he never
really explains them —is the idealist
who “never seemed to experience an
inner peace or serenity of mind,” who
was not only vain, (sending the Press
barons collections of his eulogistic over-
seas Press cuttings—which led to the
Sydney cartoons of him dashing around
with a large book labelled “Press Cut-
tings” under his arm) but also “quite
cruel, often extremely rude, downright
arrogant” in his treatment of subor-
dinates —a car driver, an airport atten-
dant, a junior departmental official, a
member of his staff, or a Party official
from Barton.
Once, Dalziel reports, he had given
Evatt an important message from F. E.
Chamberlain (which he did not want)
and Evatt went straight to the N.S.W.
State Executive to report that Dal-
ziel had not given it to him. Dalziel
calls this “paltry.” Another of his habits
—more amusing if you were not on the
receiving end —was his way of con-
cluding phone conversations: while the
fellow at the other end was bashing
away, Evatt, after saying “Yes . . . Yes
. . . Yes” would, quick as a flash, hang
up, leaving it to Dalziel to explain when
the caller rang back that they had
been disconnected and that Dr. Evatt
was now on a trunk call that looked like
lasting some time.
Another of Dalziel’s Evatt enigmas
is the Labor leader who despised the
Labor Party “Evatt needed a basic
faith to live by: the Australian Labor
Party could not supply it. His great
mistake was in thinking he could pro-
vide it in his overbearing individual-
ism.” Dalziel, presumably reflecting Dr.
Evatt’s views, refers to Mr. Calwell’s
“juvenile thinking.” He refers to Evatt’s
scorn for Gough Whitlam. “He would
laugh at the idea of Labor politicians
like Kim Beazley with his B.A. and
Gough Whitlam with his 8.A., LL.B.
being regarded as intellectuals. To him
they were very ordinary products of a
comparatively minor university educa-
tion; they had no distinguishing marks
of true iiitellectualism.”
Above all, he despised the electorate
and branches which sent him to Can-
berra Barton (which included Rock-
dale, Kogarah, Hurstville, and Bexley).
“It was like moving heaven and earth
to get him to go out there,” says Dal-
ziel, and when he did so he didn’t
always improve things. In the 1946
elections, a local band was giving him
its .services free as a tribute to him. It
was planned to render “Advance Aus-
tralia Fair” as he arrived and “See the
Conquering Hero Comes” as he entered
a Rockdale picture theatre for his
speech. As Evatt arrived at the theatre
he heard it blasting out a lively march.
“Get rid of that bloody band!” he
roared “I won’t go in until they clear
out!” Dalziel had to explain to the
bandmaster “that Dr. Evatt was a bit
overcome with the emotional nature
of the welcome and would prefer him
and his band to taper off their playing
and steal silently away into the night.”
It was Dalziel’s job to nurse the
electorate throughout Evatt’s tenure of
it from 1940 to 1958. He gives some
interesting details of how he did it.
In 1951 Evatt was nearly beaten by
Nancy Wake, but Dalziel, a fervent tee-
totaller, had been in touch with a South
Hurstville Protestant and Temperance
leader. They discussed a photograph of
Nancy Wake drinking a mug of ale in
an English inn with a caption saying
she favored liquor reform. The temper-
ance leader told Dalziel that “there
were at least 200 people in his sphere
of influence, and, although most of them
were conservative in politics, they
would, at the election, cross Party lines
and vote for Evatt.” Evatt won Barton
by about 200 votes. Again, in 1955,.
W. T. Arthur, who has since won
Barton, looked like beating Evatt. Dal-
ziel discussed the position with a leading
Mason who “made it clear to me that
he was now determined to rally his
brethren in Evatt’s support because he
resented the Roman Catholic drive to
defeat Evatt.” Evatt again won by a
couple of hundred votes.
When he finally gave up Barton in
1958 for the safe seat of Hunter, he
seemed relieved to be done with his
loyal followers in the southern suburbs.
A packed hall gave him a great ovation,.
Evatt thanked them, and went. Dalziel
was far more touched by the occasion
than Evatt: “he now seemed to have
no lingering doubts about breaking his
links with those people who had felt
bound to him by a deep sense of
personal loyalty. He moved away from
Barton on that night in 1958, went
down to his car, was driven away from
the old Kogarah School of Arts which
Evatt visits Gen. MacArthur in Japan

stood in the central part of his elec-
torate, and travelled home to Mosman,
never to look back on those who had
served him so faithfully and well.” As
a university friend of Evatt once told
Dalziel: “Always remember that with
Evatt there are no medals for loyalty.”
The interest of the book which is
really a narrative notebook lies in
details of this kind rather than in inter-
pretation. It casts little new light on
the ALP split (beyond illustrating the
savage bitterness that accompanied it
and emphasising that an Evatt Govern-
ment would have been anti-American:
Evatt’s leftism was no mere window-
dressing), and it casts no light at all
on what amounted to Evatt’s expulsion
of the Americans from the Manus
Island base, or on the internment of
the Australia Firsters during World War
11.
Where it is interpretative it is weak.
Several chapters are on the Petrov case
presumably this is what is left of
Dalziel’s long-announced “exposure” of
the “Petrov conspiracy.” He rightly em-
phasises that the Royal Commission
found that no prosecutions were war-
ranted and that Dalziel himself (re-
ported by the Royal Commission to be
code-named Sluga and Denis in Rus-
sian dispatches) was completely cleared
of giving any secret information of any
kind to any Soviet officer, wittingly or
unwittingly. He emphasises that
Madame Ollier, whom Dr. Evatt
championed, was completely cleared in
France, and that the Royal Commission
destroyed Dr. Evatt’s chance of becom-
ing Prime Minister in Australia.
Nevertheless, he has nothing what-
soever to say on the fundamental facts
that the Royal Commission unfolded
the operations of one Soviet espionage
apparatus that was attempting to build
up a network in Australia and that the
Petrovs’ defection was a major setback
to Communist espionage. For Dalziel
the whole thing was a put-up job and
like “Calais” on Queen Mary’s heart,
the word “Petrov” remains inscribed on
his heart. Evatt’s famous letter to
Molotov he puts down to a lawyer’s
simplicity: he wanted to know what
the defendant had to say.
The book takes us on to Evatt’s sad
last days in 1965 when, as a sick, broken
man, he “was losing track of things,”
confusing the United Nations with the
League of Nations and forgetting that
Pakistan had been partitioned from
India. The last words of the book
are a quotation from the Acts of the
Apostles, Chapter 5, in which it is
narrated how “a Pharisee, named Gam-
aliel, doctor of the law” persuaded
the Sadducean party in Jerusalem not
to put the Apostles to death. Gamaliel
argued that Falsehood always fails, but
Truth survives persecution; so the Sad-
duceans had the Apostles flogged, but
let them live. Dalziel had compared
Evatt to Gamaliel. He died on Mel-
bourne Cup Day, 1965, having, in
Dalziel’s words, kept the faith “accord-
ing to his lights.”
I can only say, for myself, that
although there is hardly an opinion in
the book that I agree with, it remains
a fascinating document, an essential
datum for any later study of the catas-
trophic Evatt-Dalziel period of Labor
Party history.
Candlelit erotica
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Beardsley. Stanley Weintraub. W. H.
Allen. $5.20.
“I HAVE ONE AIM the grotesque.
If I am not grotesque I am nothing.”
Aubrey Beardsley’s famous remark set
the tone of a career that lasted only
five years, from his first fame at the
age of 20 to his death in France at
25. A delicate-boned walking skeleton,
we see him reproduced here in Freder-
ick Evans’ celebrated photograph: the
hair combed forward in a manner again
fashionable, concealing the surprisingly
narrow brow; the fingers of a thread-
like delicacy, the nose aristocratic and
the downcast eyes dreamy, aesthetic,
removed. What, if his ghost still haunts
the London streets, can he be making
of his recent involvement with the art
nouveau psychedelic craze?
Mr. Weintraub’s list of previously
published books suggests a litterateur of
some minor distinction: editions of
Shaw and an anthology from “The
Yellow Book,” a study of William Gold-
ing, a collection of comments on Sir
Charles Snow. Yet his style is not, in
this book at least, literary or distin-
guished: it has a flatness and evenness,
a drab sobriety that have the effect of
reducing the brilliant peacock colors of
the era of the Cafe Royal and the
Grosvenor Gallery, of Wilde and Henry
James and Arthur Symons, to the sad
precision of a mezzotint.
The story Weintraub has to 'tell
admittedly fascinates: it is his inability
to set the scene with sufficient vivid-
ness that disappoints. To be successful,
a biographer must have the curiosity,
the flair of a novelist: George Painter’s
recent life of Proust absolutely ex-
pressed this flair. Over and over again
in Mr. Weintraub’s record of intriguing
events, one wants to reach for “The
Yellow Book,” to get a feeling of the
period’s real if very minor distinctions.
Beardsley’s origins were not distin-
guished: his father was a penniless ne’er-
do-well, his mother worked as a gov-
erness to try to keep the family afloat.
Aubrey, “like a delicate piece of Dres-
den china,” was not aided to health
by the fact that the diet his mother
enjoyed was a penny bun and a glass
of milk a day.
Aubrey’s artistic talent showed early.
He drew grotesque figures at the age
of seven, and discovered a lifelong pen-
chant for Gothic lettering.
He began doing illustrations along the
lines of Kate Greenaway, commissioned
by Lady Henrietta Pelham to assist the
little family. His broomstick calves, in-
cipient tuberculosis, and inability to play
games made him the mockery of his
fellow pupils, but he obtained some
popularity by his appearance in school
plays and in drawing brilliant carica-
tures of the masters.
His theatricality — emphasised by his
dramatically pale, gaunt, and stooping
appearance, his passion for dashing lines
and strikingly evil faces —never deserted
him, and nor did the passion for
Japanese art that early seized hold.
Whistler, too, influenced him deeply.


Graham Kerr says:
It only takes
genius to make
the perfect
omelette.
Clarified butter
helps.
Clarified butter, as you Know, is simply pure
dairy butter with the water, salt and curd
removed. Because it has no moisture it
doesn’t splutter and foam when it’s melted.
It won’t catch or burn. But the smallest
amount of it (just enough to cover the bottom
of the pan) will bring out the subtle flavour
of an omelette, for example, in a way nothing
else can. Try this recipe and prove it for
yourself. You don’t have to be a genius to
appreciate the difference Clarified Butter
makes to cooking just perceptive.
1 oz. clarified butter
2 tabs, water
pinch salt, cayenne pepper
2 eggs
Filling
1 small tomato
1 tab. vinegar
1 tab. cultured sour cream
2 oz. cottage cheese
1 tab. chopped chives
Method: Cut tomato into eight
pieces; marinate in sour cream
and vinegar 30 mins. Combine
drained tomato with cottage
cheese and chives.
Melt clarified butter in omelette
pan. Add water, salt and pepper to
eggs and beat. Pour into pan and
cook until set, gently moving the
centre to cook the omelette
evenly. Place filling on half the
surface and fold in two. Serve
immediately. Serves 1.
Clarified Butter (also sold as Ghee or Butter
Oil) may be purchased at all the best food
stores. If you have trouble obtaining it, or if
you'd like our recipe leaflet, write to The
Director, Dairy Foods Services, Australian

NATURE S FINEST
and the character of Des Esseintes in
Huysmans’ “A Rebours”: “a young man
anaemic and nervous, with hollow
cheeks, steel-blue eyes, a thin yet
aquiline nose, long tapering hands . . .”
It was almost as though he modelled
himself on Des Esseintes, because he
drew to the flickering light of tall
candles, and the sun seldom shone on his
fragile cheeks.
At 20, Beardsley was still an insurance
clerk, but with the support of Aylmer
Vallance, among others, he managed to
bring his portfolio to the greatest
figures. At first, he experienced bitter-
ness: William Morris told him icily,
“You have a feeling for draperies, and
I advise you to cultivate it.” But the
publisher, J. M. Dent, commissioned
Beardsley to illustrate Malory’s “Morte
d’Arthur,” and in 1892 the artist felt
sufficiently sanguine about his prospects
to leave his insurance office for good.
Through Robert Ross, Beardsley met
Wilde, and joined Wilde’s circle; was
chided about his lack of a sex life (he
is never known to have slept with man
or woman, although many believed him
to be homosexual) and described with
rude ineptitude by Oscar as “a mon-
strous orchid.” But he gained in con-
fidence if not in health, his conversation
sparkled with repartee, and he enjoyed
the splendors of the Cafe Royal with its
“smoky acres of painted goddesses and
cupids and tarnished gilding.” His draw-
ings for “Salome,” lately enjoying a
revival, set the seal on his success,
although Wilde himself had initial
reservations about their quality.
These reservations disappeared upon
the book’s succes de scandale, so that
asking Mrs. Patrick Campbell to see
Beardsley, he could write that Aubrey
was “a very brilliant and wonderful
young artist.” This was a far cry from
his earlier, and contemptuous refer-
ence: “I invented Aubrey Beardsley.”
By way of riposte, Beardsley put cari-
catures of Oscar into four of the
“Salome” illustrations, including show-
ing his face as “The Woman in the
Moon,” presaging the disaster which
made “Remember poor Oscar” so sig-
nificant a phrase.
Mr. Weintraub records with accuracy
and expertness if little vitality the
“Savoy” and “The Yellow Book” period,
the gradual onset of lethal illness, the
last Keatsian escape to Europe and
death. We are left at the end with a
picture of great sadness, for Beardsley’s
life was devoted to work alone. He
seems to have known no personal happi-
ness, apart from the doubtful conversa-
tional pleasures of Wilde’s salon, and
the enjoyment of his brief public suc-
cess; even that enjoyment was spoiled
by the wowserism of the Victorians. But
as he has left us a legacy of dazzlingly
complex, wicked, erotic, funny, and
brilliant works, the skeleton by candle-
light did not labor in vain.
Poor boy's tale
By NANCY KEESING
This Stubborn Soil. William A. Owens.
Faber, $5.15.
WILLIAM A. OWENS was born in
1905 mark the date in a small
Texan town called Pin Hook, near the
Oklahoma border and fairly close to
Arkansas. This book is his autobiog-
raphy until he was about 19. That he is
now a Professor of English at Columbia
University is a tribute to the tenacity
with which, against the most incredible
odds, he sought and found education.
For in the 20th century this man and his
family, his widowed mother, widowed
aunts, and grandmother, lived in condi-
tions which make the Drover’s Wife
seem affluent.
This backwoods area had never been
rich, but the continuing bitterness and
economic aftermaths of the Civil War
left it a region of grinding poverty.
The people did not have to battle Aus-
tralian drought, but they had poor soil,
severe winters, chancy water supplies
from wells, atrocious medical facilities,
insufficient clothing, and a sort of
steamy despair. No doubt their ex-
slaves, poor devils, were even worse off.
The whites seriously debated at a
church meeting whether “niggers” pos-
sessed souls. One such meeting, evenly
divided, settled for a Negro owning
half a soul!
A few children snatched three months’
optional school a year during the winter,
when the fields did not claim their
labor, but winter roads often kept them
from their desks for few could afford
shoes. The illiteracy rate was high.
Some of Owens’ family could read,
many could not. A highly respected
travelling preacher could not read his
Bible, but relied on hearing people like
Owens’ mother read it to him.
Religion was intensely important, of-
fering about the only gleam of inspira-
tion and beauty many people knew.
But what religion! An hysterical pro-
testant fundamentalism prevailed.
Meetings were attended by most people
whether they were conducted by holy
rollers, Primitive Baptists, or weird
practitioners in between.
Owens and some of his brothers
emerged and escaped. In some years
life had lighter moments, even periods
of near comfort. Young Owens met a
wood-cutter who introduced him to
books and lent him selections from his
shelves a choice of all 25 titles.
Some readers may see in this book
which is lovingly and even nostal-
gically written a sort of American
“Lark Rise.” It cannot be compared
with any Australian autobiography I
recall, for even fifty years before this
time our bush schools, schools of arts,
and mechanics’ institutes, our quite dif-
ferent atmosphere both politically, edu-
cationally, and spiritually make even the
most underprivileged cow-cocky’s kids
seem fortunate indeed.


SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
Don't go
catering to the
needs of guests
THE SUCCESSFUL businessmen
whose eating patterns I have been ob-
serving and writing about recently all
have one outstanding factor in common
when they entertain at home. It is that
they have only one cook for the
occasion their wives. No extra
assistance is sought in the actual
preparation of the food: the wives all
want to attend to this themselves.
We hear a lot these days about
expert cooks who go into the leading
homes and prepare the food for the
hostess and it is undoubtedly true that
some of these caterers are extremely
busy people. There is a lot of private
entertaining throughout Australia being
left to professionals.
But, at least in the case of the 16
top men of my panel who, of course,
shall be nameless the thought of
having a professional in their homes is
abhorrent.
I imagine one of the reasons behind
their choosing to do the food them-
selves is that their dinner parties are
usually for only eight though on
rare occasions up to 16.
Obviously, when she has more than
eight to feed, the hostess is going to
need some form of assistance in the
kitchen if she is not going to be hang-
ing on the doorknob by the time the
guests arrive. Assistance might be
necessary in other ways, too, perhaps a
waiter or a washer-up.
Is it the mark of a successful man
that he should have a wife who desires
to do her own cooking? Is it a pre-
requisite that a woman should be a
good cook if her husband is to be suc-
cessful? Undoubtedly it helps a great
deal.
I believe successful home entertain-
ing depends more on good planning
than cooking skills. More mistakes can
be made in a badly planned menu than
by bad cooking.
The greatest risk comes from the
desire to produce too grand a menu.
There is absolutely no reason to have
more than four courses, an appetiser,
a main dish, a cheese with some fresh
fruit, followed by a sweet and coffee.
The first course should be cold, a
dish that can be set on the table before
the guests enter the dining-room. The
meat, fish, or poultry dish to follow
should preferably be in casserole form,
because it is easily prepared ahead by
the hostess. It means she doesn’t have
to rush out to the kitchen and spend 15
to 20 minutes on last-minute prepara-
tions.
The main dish should be accom-
panied by two vegetables, one of good
color, which obviously narrows the field
to the inevitable carrot or tomato, and
the other a green vegetable, which is
carefully cooked so that it is green
when it reaches the table. One farina-
ceous dish should be served, rice,
potatoes, or some form of pasta. The
vegetables will require last-minute pre-
paration, and, if there is a kitchen
assistant, she can attend to the re-
heating or sauteeing in butter, leaving
the hostess where she belongs at the
dining-table.
The sweet should always be prepared
ahead. Maybe—and this is a good idea
—there can be a degree of table-cook-
ing. Though seldom done, the blend of
prepared mixtures with last-minute
finishing touches at the table can be a
delightful experience. For this, you
need to have a simple table- or flare-
lamp—there are inexpensive flare lamps
which operate on butane gas and
place it on a trolley.
Cherries Jubilee, Flames Straw-
berries in Kirsch, or Chinese Goose-
berries flamed in Grand Marnier are all
ideal accompaniments to a little vanilla
ice-cream or shortcake, or, better still,
a fine, lacy pancake filled with a cream
cheese mixture.
I’m also much in favor of flamed
soft fruits in brandy with a cheesecake.
A little care is needed here because
very hot fruit straight from the pan
should not be poured immediately over
the cheesecake. You really need two
plates - one for the cheesecake, the
other for the flaming fruit.
I believe in serving cheese between
the main dish and the sweet. This aids
the digestive process and also allows
you to enjoy the last of the red wine,
which otherwise gets thrown away or
just left on the table when the sweet
dish arrives.
Obviously it is difficult to drink a
good red burgundy with a frothy
dessert. So, to finish the wine while it
is still fresh and interesting in the
mouth, with a little cheese, seems like
a good basic economy. And the dis-
cussion, which usually takes place over
the cheese, gives time to regenerate
interest -in food, and you can attack
the sweet with gusto.
When all is said and done it appears
that a successful man needs a wife who
is good at planning a dinner party. And
from what I have observed, I’m sure
that these wives do enjoy cooking for
special home entertainment. Un-
doubtedly it gives them a sense of
personal satisfaction. And, where this
satisfaction is combined with a sense
of participation in their husbands’
careers, there can be little doubt that,
the husbands, too, will be well content
with their lot.
Contentment, at least in my book, is
a good 90 percent of the battle for
success.
LETTERS
Good art forgeries lately
Your art critic, Mr. Lynn (8., Jan,
6), draws our attention very vividly to
a basic problem of art criticism about
which we should possess some elemen-
tary knowledge, otherwise it is not
possible to form a worthwhile opinion
about art.
Mr. Lynn quotes some eminent auth-
orities such as Dr. Ursula Hoff, Profes-
sor Alfred Lessing, and Arthur Koest-
ler, to mention only a few of some
hundred international aestheticians and
art critics who have corresponded with
me concerning this interesting problem.
Mr. Lynn, states: “There lies the prob-
lem: if a forgery is aesthetically valid
how can it lose its validity once it has
been declared a fake?” I have come
to the conclusion that the fundamental
element in this problem is one of sem-
antics: e.g., like asking if a forged ten-
dollar note is economically valid, how
can it lose its validity once it has been
declared a fake? Both propositions
imply validity that never existed.
That the validity of either was ever
accepted, history (not me) has shown
that those who accepted it just did not
know what they were talking about.
(And, with humility, it should be
pointed out that in matters about which
we know little we are prone to over
credit authorities such as art experts,
share brokers, financial writers, pro-
fessors and the like, with a profundity
of knowledge that I am sure they would
not claim to possess.)
That anyone receives aesthetic pleas-
ure from any object implies, but does
not necessarily mean,- that the object
has inherent aesthetic qualities. What
actually happens is that at that par-
ticular moment the object had the
power to give us aesthetic pleasure, and
history again has shown us that all of
us often receive aesthetic pleasure from
objects of very doubtful worth.
Kirwan in his “Uncertainty of Life”'
claims that “everything human admits
of change and vicissitude: states and
empires, arts and sciences, customs and
manners, laws and governments, feel,
without ceasing, this inevitable prin-
ciple acting upon them,” and it appears
to me not unreasonable to assume that
our horizons of judgments and aesthetic
sensitivity constantly and consequently
change in exact ratio to our new ex-
periences.
Mr. Lynn makes an excellent and
long overdue point in drawing our at-
tention to the never-ending stream of
Thai and other repetitious Eastern art.
For few people in Australia, it appears,,
are aware that it is a universally rec-
ognised fact that contemporary oriental

i understand that no sales representative
will call
aestheticians look for originality both
in ancient and contemporary works, and
not in contemporary works alone.
When Mr. Lynn writes “yet some
people find something morally repug-
nant in a forgery however aesthetically
attractive it is” I assume he means that
one person can find an object aestheti-
cally attractive and morally repugnant
at the same time. It is inconceivable
to me that these two emotions could
exist in the same person at the same
time about the same object.
After much searching I have come to
the belief that a good enough replica
of any kind of work of art does not
possess the slightest aesthetic qualities
of its own. It merely reflects the aes-
thetic qualities of the original.
But as I am still searching for the
“sesame,” the “aesthetic stone” so to
speak, I am writing this letter in the
hope that some of your readers may
be able to throw some further light
upon the subject.

Cult of the non-book
I have never read such a load of
tripe as The Cult of the Non-Book
(8., Dec. 30). It is indeed “the
memoirs of fishermen, shoeblacks,
lieutenant-generals,” etc., which form
the basis of social history. “A King’s
Story” has been a popular book not
because people “enjoy day-dreaming
about kings” but because they wish to
read a personal account of the Duke
of Windsor’s life, abdication, etc. Any-
how, the book market is not swamped
with this type of literature. Go past
any bookseller’s window and see for
yourself, Simon Raven. Hoorah for
The Bulletin’s literary critics, but oh
for more broadminded views of the
book-publishing scene.

Which generation's "Messiah"
H. W. Denning (8., Jan. 6)
appears much upset at Paul Frolich’s
preference for the original 1742 edition
of Handel’s “Messiah,” and takes ex-
ception to slighting references made
to Victorian additions to this work by
saying “. . . let us have Handel’s im-
mortal work interpreted to our own
generation in our generation’s idiom.
How the oratorio was performed in
1742 is purely a matter of antiquarian
interest.” Now just what does Mr. Den-
ning mean? Is he making a case for
arrangers et al. to bring “up to date”
any works of their choosing? Is he
seriously asking us to believe that, hav-
ing accepted these embellishments, fur-
ther interest in the original is “anti-
quarian,” the sole preserve of students?
Lastly, does he suffer the delusion that
a Victorian swamp of mouldy sound,
clouded with aspidistras, potted palms,
and wilting ladies is of “our own
generation in our generation’s idiom”?
It seems to have escaped Mr. Den-
ning that the finely chiselled sounds
of 1742 which he dismisses are very
much the order of this generation.
Many composers of today’s modern
schools are writing for small ensembles,
and an overall clarity of texture with
an emphasis on clearly defined sound
is very much in keeping with the aims
of the baroque composers.
I would refer Mr. Denning to either
of the new recordings of this work
under Davis or Mackerrass in what
would appear to be a futile endeavor
to convince him that the original sound
of 1742 is an absolute joy to the mind
and senses and very much of this gener-
ation.

Devaluation parable
Most of us are familiar with the
eighth Commandment, which deals
briefly with diversion of wealth; but
one way of getting round the problem
without undue apprehension about
consequences is to raise Paul’s prices
without raising Peter’s.
A lesser quantity of Paul’s produce
can then be exchanged for a given
quantity of Peter’s to the detriment of
Peter for the benefit of Paul. The con-
ventional method is for the Government
to raise the prices of imports which com-
pete with Paul’s produce without rais-
ing the price of Peter’s overseas funds.
Paul can then charge higher prices and
pay higher wages and the wage earners
can afford to pay higher prices because
they receive higher wages. But that is
not the whole story.
A notable feature of the whole system
is that the Government does not raise
the prices of competitive imports. Paul
can thereby sell his produce at an in-
flated price concurrently with buying
these duty-free imports at an uninflated
price.
This benefit is gained by requiring
Peter to sell all his exports at an unin-
flated price whilst at the same time
having to pay for most of his goods and
services at highly inflated prices. Paul
and the wage earners like these benefits,
which they share. The Government
likes them because they benefit a
majority at the expense of a minority
besides providing a certain rake-off in
import duties. In fact the system robs
Peter to pay Paul.
John Stuart Mill, philosopher and
economist of the nineteenth century, be-
lieved there should be some protection
of minorities against the excesses of a
democracy and there would appear
to be a lot of validity in his view.

Roll forged twist drills cost no more, yet are so superior in performance,
that the cost savings they make possible in your production programme
can mean all the difference between your obtaining full profit margins or
just getting-by! Is this a problem you’re facing? You’ll find that twist
drills made by the roll forging process have superior, heavy-cutting
ability, provide increased drilling rates well in excess of B.S. requirements,
and possess a hard, burnished surface-finish that ensures longer life and
fewer re-sharpens. Up to twice as many holes per drill! All this because
as the result of the roll forging drill-manufacturing process, the granular
structure of the high speed steel used, follows the contour of the cutting
edge. No interrupted end-to-end grain where flutes have been milled or
ground out. Roll forged strength throughout! For better drilling
specify P&N Roll Forged Twist Drills, Silver Jet or Black Jet surface
finish: range 1/16th to 1/2-inch. That’s the way to make more
dollars — by direct savings in cost!
