EXPLORERS AS WRITERS
After writing an excellent introduc-
tion to her Australian Explorers
(Oxford University Press “World’s
Classics”), Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Asso-
ciate Professor of History at the Uni-
versity of Melbourne, wisely allows the
explorers to tell their own stories.
With one or two exceptions, they
make as good a job of it as they did of
their explorations. Without having
taken a course in literary expression,
they find no difficulty in finding words
to describe their experiences and
observations, and when they generalise,
which isn’t often, they show much more
wisdom and humanity than many of
the idealists who have been banging
the drum for the aboriginal and justice.
Thus Eyre:—
The Aborigines of this country
have seldom been guilty of unpro-
voked outrages, or committed acts
of rapine or bloodshed, without
some strongly exciting cause, or
under the influence of feelings that
would have weighed in the same
degree with Europeans in similar
circumstances.
Even when in extremis and dying
from starvation along with Burke, Wills
found time to make some general
observations on the subject of diet: —
My pulse is 48, and very weak,
and my legs and arms are nearly
skin and bone. 1 can only look
out, like Mr. Micawber, “for some-
thing to turn up,” but starvation
on nardoo is by no means very
unpleasant but for the weakness
one feels, and the utter inability to
move oneself, for as far as appetite
is concerned, it gives me the greatest
satisfaction. Certainly, fat and sugar
would be more to one's taste, in
fact, those seem to me to be the great
stand-by for one in this extra-
ordinary continent ; not that I mean
to depreciate the farinaceous food,
but the want of fat and sugar in all
substances obtainable here is so
great that they become almost value-
less to us as articles of food, with-
out the addition of something else.
Giles, who discovered the forbidding
Gibson’s desert and twice crossed the
“extraordinary continent,” thus des-
cribes what motivates the true explorer;
The wild charm and exciting
desire that induce an individual to
undertake the arduous tasks that lie
before an explorer, and the pleasure
and delight of visiting new and
totally unknown places, are only
whetted by his first attempt. I have
called my book The Romance of
Exploration; the romance is in the
chivalry of the achievement of diffi-
cult and dangerous, if not almost
impossible, tasks. An explorer is an
explorer from love, and it is nature,
not art, that makes him so.
Thus did the knight of old set out to
rescue the fair lady beleaguered by a
dragon: there was very little romance in
the doing of the explorer’s deeds of
valor; —
On w'hat I thought was the 27th
[says Giles], I almost gave up the
thought of walking any further, for
the exertion in this dreadful region,
where the triodia was almost as high
as myself, and as thick as it could
grow, was quite overpowering, and,
being starved, I felt quite light-
headed .... A bare and level sandy
waste would have been Paradise to
walk over compared to this. My
arms, legs, thighs, both before and
behind, were so punctured by spines,
it was agony only to exist; the
slightest movement and in went more
spines, where they broke off in the
clothes and flesh, causing the whole
of the body that was punctured to
gather in minute pustules, which were
continually growing and bursting.
After this Giles might have been
excused if he had returned to his job
as a Victorian civil servant; but his
sufferings only stimulated him to set-
out on another expedition.
It was a dream of an inland sea
which stimulated Sturt to go on his
greatest expedition, and neither reason
nor his own experience could put him
off it. One of his officers, Poole,
actually saw it:—
A sea extending along the horizon
in which there are a number of
islands and lofty ranges as far as the
eye can reach. What is all this —are
we to be prosperous? Tomorrow we
start for the ranges, and then for the
waters —the strange waters on which
boat never swam and over which
flag never floated.
The sea, the mountains and the
islands, unfortunately, proved to be a
mirage, but in his efforts to find a way
out Sturt discovered the Simpson
desert, “one of the most gloomy regions
that man has ever traversed the
stillness of death reigned round us, no
living creature was to be heard; nothing
inhabited that dreary desert but the
ant, even the fly shunned it.”
Of all the explorers, John Forrest,
the only Australian, is most laconic,
Leichhardt the most sensitive to Nature
and insensitive to the feelings of his
companions. Big John’s dryness was
not due to lack of imagination but to
the fact that he was born in the bush,
and sights and happenings which sent
Stuart and Warburton into ecstasies of
excitement were commonplaces to him.
Sturt had a sense of the dramatic.
When floating down the Murrumbidgee
his party encountered a tribe of blacks
to the number of 700 who surrounded
them an all sides and showed every
intention of wiping them out. A clash
seemed unavoidable, and Sturt reluct-
antly picked up his gun and was aiming
it at the man who seemed to be the
ringleader when suddenly a strange
black appeared on the further bank,
threw himself into the water and,
struggling across to the sandbank
.... stood in front of the savage
against whom my aim had been
directed. Seizing him by the throat,
he pushed him backwards and,
forcing all who were in the water
upon the bank, he trod its margin
with a vehemence and an agitation
which were extremely striking. At
one moment pointing to the boat,
at another shaking his clenched hand
in the faces of the most forward,
and stamping with passion on the
sand....
The reader will imagine our feel-
ings on this occasion... .We were
so wholly lost in interest at the
scene that was passing, that the
boat was allowed to drift at pleasure
.... For my own part I was over-
whelmed with astonishment and, in
truth, stunned and confused ; so
singular, so unexpected, and so
strikingly providential had been our
escape.
It is a pity that (though he reappears
in a novel by J. K. Ewers) nobody
knows the name of this mediator
between the white man and the black;
he deserves a monument. “The
Unknown Aborigine,” alongside Sturt’s.
Henry James in Paris
It can fairly confidently be stated
that, if only for fear that he would
never get to the end of his first sentence,
no newspaper today would employ
Henry James to write its “Letter from
Paris”; but that is hardly a proof of
the vulgarisation of the modem press,
for if the New York “Tribune” in 1875
kept him going long enough to write
the articles now collected in Parisian
Sketches (Rupert Hart-Davis), edited
by Leon Edel and Isle Dusoir Lind, the
paper was pretty soon forced to sack

"POLICY" AND PRACTICE
TvR. EVATT’S policy-speech for the
Federal elections was the usual
superficial vote-catching thing with a
new twist —the election bribes are to
have the added virtue of an economic
“activator,” much approved by other
boom-and-bust economists. The true
vision of Labor seems to have become
a tattered rag which its leaders are
afraid to exhibit. They leave it to the
Communists to flaunt in all its shabbi-
ness.
The objective still stands on paper
—the only objective set-out in the
Federal platform; and it is emphasised
in the pledge which every candidate
for election to every Parliament is
compelled to sign:—
I pledge myself to actively support and
advocate at all times the party’s objective
—the socialisation of industry, production,
distribution and exchange.
The N.S.W. State platform amplifies
this by setting-out a method of
“development of the policy of socialisa-
tion of industry” taken from the
Russian Constitution, including partici-
pation of employees in management on
the soviets system. Dr. Evatt last year
said: “The objective remains. It is both
implicit and explicit in the [A.L.P ]
constitution.”
Yet for all their pledges. Labor’s
leaders have come to run a mile every
time the word “socialisation,” set down
as their only objective, is mentioned.
Dr. Evatt felt bound to allay any fears
among electors that he might try to
introduce it, if elected, by saying that
though democratic Socialism was the
party’s policy, it was not practical
politics because it would need a referen-
dum to carry it out. And he felt bound
to defend the Cahill Government, those
apparently ardent devotees of the State
platform of- socialisation, or, rather,
sovietisation, against the awful charge
that they are Right-wingers.
Gone is the vision, and if the spirits
of departed giants of the Labor party
are able to see what is going on in the
heart of the A.L.P. they must be in
the depths of despair as they watch
what was once a great party, now with
its back to the wall, trying to buy its
life from the electors with the miserable
series of sordid, specious bribes which
make up the corpus of Dr. Evatt’s
“policy.”
TAR. EVATT’S “policy-speech” is not.
of course, his real policy-speech. It
is merely an attempt to buy votes. The
real policy of Labor at the moment is
one of sheer defence against marauders.
The true condition and purposes of
Labor are to be read in the official
report of the proceedings of the 22nd
Commonwealth Conference of the
Australian Labor Party, held at Bris-
bane on March 11 last year, which
pictured both the state of the party
as a whole and its preoccupations with
dangers with which —with good reason
-—it has become familiar.
The conference proceedings reek of
despair. There was a presidential
address by F. E. Chamberlain which
set the keynote, shrilling warnings to
the gathering that any departure from
the principles of democratic Socialism
might mean that the “beacon that was
lit at Hobart may go out for eVer”—
the beacon being an adaptation of the
Communist-party policy.
Mr. Chamberlain felt his way
through his speech like a man pursued;
pursued by “the forces within, posing
as genuine Labor men... .moving tire-
lessly .... with organised energy....
through the branches and the unions”
-—bent on “sowing the seed of discon-
tent with Labor leadership... .under-
taking a steady campaign for reconcilia-
tion between the Labor party and the
breakaway groups.”
The battle-cry of Mr. Chamberlain,
as president of Australia’s supposed
greatest and most embattled party, was:
“I warn the party of the dangers that
lie ahead.” And his conception of the
Australian people. Labor’s friends, was
obviously that of a race short on
“material and spiritual comfort”
because they are “in want.”
His visualisation of the driving-force
of Labor's enemies was that “these
people are not afraid of Communism
becoming a dominating force in the
Australian community. What they are
afraid of is that Labor will become
really serious about its Socialist
objective.” “Become really serious”
about the Labor objective? Isn’t Labor
serious about it? One would imagine
not. to listen to Mr. Chamberlain. Or
to Dr. Evatt, who says it is not practical
politics.
Mr. Chamberlain was obviously a
frightened man who was not quite sure
what he was saying at times, as he
whistled through his words to keep his
courage up: —
The task [of educating the Australian
people to attain the Socialist objective]
should be no longer delayed ... It will
require courage—GßEAT COURAGE.
Courage to resist the easy path.
COURAGE to reject the application of
expedients, and to demand at all times
the application of Labor principle. The
determination to work for POLICY
before SEATS.
is no sign in Dr. Evatt’s policy-
speech that the executive of the Federal
party was infected by his plea for
courage.
First on the list of “the more import-
ant decisions of the Federal Executive”
during the two-year period since the
previous conference in Hobart was its
explanation of the details of its des-
perate effort to prevent its members
standing for office and saving expenses
by forwarding their common policy
with the Communist party on unity-
tickets. It appears that the executive
“directed State branches to protect the
policy of the party by taking action
against any member who so offends.”
And as events have since proved, dozens
of union candidates for union offices
and at least one State executive have
told it to go and chase itself.
CO have the sections of the industrial-
groups .organisation, whose existence
it declared to be “an affront not only to
the Australian Labor Party but to the
organised trade - union movement.”
Despite its ban on Communists, the
A.L.P. does not, quite obviously, con-
sider the existence of Communist
leadership in the unions the same sort
of affront —especially when they collect
levies for A.L.P. election funds by
force.
Dr. Evatt’s speech at the conference,
as officially reported, was similar in
fabric to Mr. Chamberlain’s, revealing
how much the party is a thing of para-'
sites intent on eating-out its heart.
These are the sort of things that
Labor behind ,the scenes has been
preoccupied with, .along with a dole-
ful conviction that the country has long
been plunged in ruin with a Govern-
ment that “cannot solve the nation’s
problems”: a Go ernment that—as
early as 1956 —it declared to have
“failed lamentably... .lost the confi-
dence of the nation.... lost all moral
right to continue in office.” This view
of the Government’s position goes
strangely indeed with Mr. Chamber-
lain’s exhortations —in capital letters —
to COURAGE.
All that Labor appears to have lost,
judging by Dr. Evatt’s policy-speech,
is its objective and its soul. Both
may be reposing in some lost-property
office ready to be redeemed if Labor
attains power, but there is no sign of
the existence of either in his policy-
speech, which is merely a string of
offers of bribes and promises which
would shame a Port Said confidence-
trickster selling Turkish delight. It is
vote-buying at its worst.


"IT DIDN'T QUITE REACH THE MOON, EITHER."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Evatt's "Self-financing"
Policy
Dr. Evatt proposes to deal with the
problems of what he calls “a profiteering
economy” and the “financial stagnation
caused by the Menzies Government” by
giving the community “a sharp stimulus”
through the increase of social-service
benefits and the issue of -Treasury-bills.
“These Treasury-bills will be working
for the economy,” he says. “They will
be stimulating demand and restoring
private employment. This is what
Treasury-bills are for.”
Referring to the social-service exten-
sions he has proposed, the building of
schools and hospitals, roads, etc., he avers
(but not with originality —Major Douglas
and the Communists were a long way
ahead of him) that “it is no more difficult
to provide these things in time of peace
than it is to provide the requirements of
war in times of war.”
Summarising the method by which
Labor will pay for its electioneering
promises, Dr. Evatt says:
The revenue required is already in the
present Budget. Treasury bills can be
allocated and appropriated to public works,
the payment for which is covered by taxa-
tion already imposed or authorised. Labor's
proposals are designed to restore the
economy and are, to that extent, self-
financing. Treasury bills will be used to
tide-over the gap in public loans until
revenue and the loan-market are revitalised.
Taxation on a just basis will be planned,
but held in reserve to be used only if the
facts of the economy justify it.
With the massing of the forces of his
Treasury-bills on the one hand, he pro-
poses to restore cost-of-living adjust-
ments on the other:
We agree with the A.C.T.U. and trade-
union movement that the 1953 Federal
Court decision to abandon cost-of-living
quarterly adjustments was disastrous to the
economy, and had the effect of enriching
powerful groups of employers at the
expense of the wage-earners who were
prejudiced for years by the elimination of
cost-of-living adjustments to the basic-
wage.
Between the inflationary force of whole-
sale use of Treasury-bilLfinance and the
release of the notoriously inflationary
cost-of-living spiral, Australia would
undoubtedly see a state of raging inflation
not paralleled even by the aftermath of
the Labor-sponsored national 40-hour
week, effective in 1948 and the chief
reason for the huge loss in value of the
£ in subsequent years.
The Evatt financial proposals are of
the Douglas Credit type, which were
familiar as the slogans of short-cut
currency-cranks in the depression, and
are superficial and irresponsible. He
does not tackle any of the real problems
of the Australian economy—underpro-
ductivity, the burden of the 40-hour week
on a young economy, the anomalous
taxation of companies, the effect of pay-
roll-tax on private enterprise, or the
problems of a raw-material exporting
country at a time of depressed com-
modity prices.
Yet Sydney “Herald” has said that he
“has produced a policy-speech almost
entirely economic in content, in the
knowledge that a large part of his
promises would indeed be financially
feasible.” And his “emphasis on the
stimulation of personal consumption....
would indeed reactivate the economy in
the quickest possible way.”
Fortunately Dr. Evatt's proposals have
not received the approval of any
responsible financial authority or politi-
cal economist.
They are a fantastic mixture of Yarra-
bank tubthumping against the profits of
private enterprise (hence our “profiteer-
ing economy”), ordinary electoral bribery,
Douglas Credit theory, rag-trade
economics and Sydney “Herald’s” own
brand of political and economic
philosophy.
Dr. Evatt has quoted Warwick Fairfax
as agreeing with him that the Australian
economy is in “a state of relative stag-
nation,” and has quoted extensively from
“Herald” criticism of the Menzies Gov-
ernment.
The shortcomings of the Menzies Gov-
ernment, which Dr. Evatt desperately
hopes to unseat and which Sydney
“Herald” aims to embarrass, arise
mainly out of the problems (such as the
40-hour week and similar industrial dis-
abilities) which have been created by
Labor and the trade-union movement
and which Dr. Evatt is pledged to
accentuate. He is dedicated to socialisa-
tion, which has tended to spread through
parts of our economy already and which
the Menzies Government has had diffi-
culty in eradicating. He is an advocate of
equal pay for women. And it is most
unlikely that if Dr. Evatt became Prime
Minister he would do anything to reduce
the number of civil servants ; he would
be bound to increase them and to extend
the “controls” to which he is addicted
and the demand for which would increase
as his own particular inflation virus
ravaged the economic health" of the com-
munity. His avowed “self-financing”
policy might live on itself as inflation
has been seen to live on //self. But as a
virus “golden staph” would be scarcely
in the race with it.
Local-government
Boundaries
The Mitchell-region boundaries inquiry,
which concluded its hearing at Bathurst
on October 10, was one of the longest
of its kind held under the N.S.W. Local
Government Act. Beginning on Septem-
ber 8, it extended over 24 sitting-days,
and Commissioner H. W. Dane heard
130 witnesses ; evidence and reports sub-
mitted ran into close on three-quarters-
of-a-million words.
“And what good came of it at last?”
asked little Peterkin. Well, that won’t be
known for several weeks, but interested
parties in the Central West are discussing
the remarks of R. G. Henderson, the
barrister appointed to assist the commis-
sioner, and trying to decide what effect
they will have on the commissioner, the
Minister for Local Government and the
future of the Mitchell region.
The inquiry was divided into three
parts. At the conclusion of Part I —the
proposal to absorb the Shire of Canobo-
las into the City of Orange—Henderson
said that he
could not see that the evidence given had
established that Orange district would suffer
any harm, either in the present or in the
future, if the Orange proposal was rejected.
Nor could he see that any benefit would
necessarily follow to the Orange district if
the amalgamation plan was adopted. In
his opinion the onus of proof which
Orange had assumed had not been dis-
charged. He concluded, “Accordingly, I
suggest to you, Mr. Commissioner, that the
proposal be rejected.”
Of the Bathurst proposals —that large
portions of Turon and Abercrombie
Shires should be absorbed into the City
of Bathurst and the remaining portions
amalgamated to form a new shire —•
Henderson said:
There is no evidence of any tangible
harm to Bathurst if either plan is rejected,
and no tangible evidence of any harm
occurring to Bathurst in the future....
There is no evidence of any particular
detailed planning which would justify the
expansion of the city beyond the present
limits.
In regard to the proposal that Blaxland
Shire should be absorbed into the City
of Lithgow, Henderson told the com-
missioner that he felt the situation was
quite different from the two previous
cases. He said that both the Lithgow
Municipality and Blaxland Shire Council
had produced evidence that there should
be some extension, but that extension
should be governed as it affected the
economics of the shire:
On the evidence produced, even as it
stands, Blaxland Shire is not an economic
unit in the sense that the other shires which
appeared to give evidence at the previous
inquiries are.
Mr. Dane said he would submit his
report to the Minister and that the muni-
cipalities and shires concerned would in
due course be advised through the
Department of Local Government of the
Minister’s decision.
The New Australian Vote
[From “O.CS.”]
Her vital statistics (including her age)
were fiftyish. While waiting for the
meeting to open she made everyone near
her well aware that she had recently been
naturalised ; had been made a member
of “The Party”; and was keenly looking
forward to casting a vote for the first
time in her life. She repeatedly stood-up
and surveyed the audience to see if any-
body from “our branch” had come in.
The hall filled. The policy-speech
began. Every reference to freedom,
justice, individual rights of the workers,
and their wives, and their children, and
our New Australian friends, and world
peace, and future happiness, received her
most enthusiastic approval. Near the end
of an eloquent passage, while her own
hands, and every other pair of hands,
were poised ready for fervent applause,
she turned to her friend and quickly
said: “I am not liking Mrs. Evatt’s hat,
did you?”


IMawson
lr Douglas Mawson died after having
ved to see his dreams of the scientific
evelopment of the Antarctic begin to
ake shape during the international
eophysical year.
Australia's share in Antarctic explora-
ion began under the inspiration of the
loyal Society of Victoria and the Vic-
orian Branch of the Royal Geographical
Society in the early 1890's, eventually
nspiring H. J. Bull to organise the
:xpedition in the Antarctic provided by
he Norwegians. Among its members,
Tarsten Borchgrevink, a Norwegian sur-
/eyor from Queensland, landed as first
nan to set foot on the Antarctic con-
sent. A few years later his party was
:he first to spend a year in the Antarctic,
ind his work was the beginning of the
ira of the great British explorers, whose
second expedition under Shackleton
'1907-09) contained an Australian party
—Edgworth David, Mawson, and
Mackay—which reached the region of
the South Magnetic Pole on January 16,
1909, and climbed Mt. G rebus. This was
succeeded by the tragic and glorious
expedition of Captain Robert Falcon
Scott, 1910-12, and by Amundsen’s
successful attempt to reach the South
Pole.
From them Mawson took-up the torch,
and it was during his expedition in the
Aurora, 1911-14, with Captain J. K.
Davis as second in command, that
George Ainsworth and five others estab-
lished on Macquarie Island (in December,
1911), the first meteorological and wire-
less link and serviced it for two years,
after which the Commonwealth Govern-
ment relieved them and maintained it
into the early years of World War I.
Mawson and his companions during
their long sojourn operated from Cape
Denison, on Commonwealth Bay on
King George the Fifth Land, surveyed
1000 miles of coastline and established,
its continuity and sent off a party (which
included Frank Hurley) to the South
Magnetic Pole area, while the leader
himself, on an epic journey, reached a
point 316 miles east of Cape Denison.
He lost two of his men and barely
escaped with his own life. Sixteen years
later he led the great British Anzac
Expedition, 1929-31.
First-innings Score
[From Canberra]
Opposition-leader Doc. Evatt decided
to bat first on a sticky wicket for the
triennial Test-match between himself and
Primd Minister Menzies.
Evatt’s opening score of £l2O million
not-out, made-up of social-service
benefits, interest-cuts, tax-“byes” and
sundries, looked irqpressive until closely
analysed.
Menzies, in a post-mortem on the first
play, didn’t disclose his planned
counter-attack, but with advice from the
experts at his call he has succeeded in
taking some of the sting out of Doc.’s
team-mates, who are yet to bat.
In an hour-long innings, the Doc.,
after attacking some admitted weaknesses
in Menzies’s efforts to date, then set-out
to build-up his tally.
His biggest hit was the increased child-
endowment, which would cost an addi-
tional million, with another £2O-odd
million for increased repatriation benefits.
Those two took care of the kids and
the “Old Diggers” sitting on the Hill.
Next, for those without a roof over
their head, who also had been barrack-
ing the slow scoring, he indicated he
would “strain every effort” to overcome
the housing-lag within three years.
For the cow-cockies in the Sheridan
Stand, and their city counterparts, the
middle-class business-owner, he scored
an electioneering boundary with promises
of assistance in marketing wheat, dairy
produce, wool, eggs and other primary
products, and undertakings to gradually
remove the payroll-tax.
Young engaged couples in the Sheridan
also cheered his indication of some sort
of marriage-loans, but in the M. A.
Noble Stand there was some headshaking
about regulating h.-p. interest-rates.
After the first day’s play, the spectators
were somewhat confused.
The Hill-ites reckoned it was a spec-
tacular knock, as did some in the
Sheridan, but most others felt it was a
display of fluky showmanship that could
not be sustained under strong attack,
and certainly not an innings to put his
team in an unbeatable position, nor one
which produced many sound strokes.
The Doc.’s tail-enders will have a
knock before Menzies opens on October
29, but it is doubtful if they will take
the score much beyond Evatt’s opening
effort.
Menzies expects that the press critics
and some members of his team will do
sufficient sniping at the Doc. between
now and October 29, and he is expected
to go straight in, and rather than try
to outscore Evatt, he will consolidate
what his team has done over the past
three years.
He has already said that for Evatt to
get his score on the official records-book
it would mean either increased taxation
or a grave wave of inflation.
His experts told him the Doc.’s
promises would cost £165 million a year,
and Menzies added that the proposals
were incompetent and dangerous.
To prove that the Doc.’s stroke-making
was amateurish, the P.M. added:
“If he [Evatt] won and honored his
promises in his 1959 Budget, he would
either have to compel the central bank
to provide so much new money as to
produce an unprecedented inflation, or,
like the New Zealand Labor Government,
would have to increase taxes steeply to
find the promised cash.”
Defence, Diplomacy and
Dr. Evaft
Even if his economic proposals did not
rule him out as a potential Prime Minis-
ter, Dr. Evatt’s record in foreign affairs
and his expressed views on defence should
banish all chance that he would ever be
trusted with office.
He has, all through his career, had
an attraction for Communists similar to
that of honey for flies. And his ears
seem to be more receptive to their argu-
ments than to those of others.
His voice was generally raised, as in
the Ratliff-Thomas affair, during the war,
when Communists were in jeopardy from
the Security measures. It was equally
raised in the opposite direction when
the unfortunate Australia First men were
interned following a campaign by the
Communist party against them.
The evidence before the Petrov Com-
mission exhibited his secretaries un-
wittingly associating with notorious Com-
munists on a social basis, his depart-
ment infiltrated with Communists.
When the Menzies Government
attempted to pass its bill for the sup-
pression of the party, Dr. Evatt was the
leader of the referendum campaign in
defence of the party’s right to exist and
won it with his eloquence.
When the Petrov Commission was
appointed he used his powers in the
most extraordinary manner to make the
inquiry, which so closely touched the
safety of the Commonwealth, abortive.
In the subsequent proceedings, Dr.
Evatt in Parliament showed himself
prepared to believe the word of
Molotov in preference to the find-
ings of three distinguished Australian
judges, arrived at after a long and patient
hearing of evidence. And this was fully
in line with his attitude when Minister
for External Affairs, it being a com-
plaint among our Allies, and particularly
those concerned with the occupation of
Japan, that he so often ranged
with the Russian delegate against General
MacArthur’s (or the British) views.
In foreign affairs generally, his interest
leaned to support of colored people
against whites, to the dismemberment
of the old British Commonwealth and
the removal of European influence in
Asia.
His preoccupation now, as it has been
ever since the Hobart Conference, is
the recognition of Communist China,
which he urged with zeal at the Federal
A.L.P. conference last year.
In defence, Dr. Evatt and a Govern-
ment which included persons like Ward
and Calwell would be no more reliable
than in foreign affairs.
When they were in power before, their
Prime Minister, Mr. Chifley, went to
the A.L.P. Federal Conference and asked
it to dictate the national defence policy,
and as a result of that dictation com-
pulsory service was abolished and train-
ing almost ended on the plea that it was
sufficient to have nuclear defence and
that all further wars would be push-
button wars in which trained manpower
would not matter.
Labor defence policy seems to be to
“organise for peace,” and to campaign
against the continuance of the develop-
ment of nuclear defence.
The prospect of its having the security
of Australia in its hands is hair-raising.
It would be an almost certain bet that
one of the first acts of a triumphant
Labor Government would be to invite
both Red Russia and Red China to
establish themselves in Canberra s diplo-
matic world.

My gentle friend the Average Man,
Dear So-and-so of Such-and-such,
You’ve spoiled the economic plan —
They say you eat and drink too much ;
The clothing-store that cuts your coat
Complains you’ve left it on the rack—
There’s too much going down your
throat
And not enough upon your back.
The way you eat, the way you drink,
Your coats should burst, your pants
should split
Three times a year ; and so you’d think
You’d buy tri-annual suits to fit:
I can’t see why you don’t —unless
You’re .vo determined to grow stout
You’ve all been buying XOS
And set to work to fill them out.
Unfair to tailors, you have been :
Americans, aware of this,
Are bringing Prohibition in
To level inequalities,
Till clothing in which man’s exhibited
Equals what renders him exhibitive,
And alcohol is as prohibited
As clothing-prices are prohibitive.

T once ate a meal cooked by Oscar

about to put his invention on the
market he was after advance pub-
licity. Fifteen Melbourne notables and
pressmen in a large room in a city hotel
saw Oscar cook the eatables prepared

coat and striped pants ; a small, worried-
looking valet producing spoons, ladles,

nificently resonant voice, in
the tone of the Moor or a
domineering Petrucbio, de-
manding of his cringing

who picked from an aerial photograph
200 homes in a post-war area. No names

resident interviewed is a different mem-,
ber of the family—mother, father, son
or daughter. Questions are about the
use being made of parks, sporting-
grounds, tennis-courts, libraries and
child-minding centres ; questioners want
to know what prevents people making
full use of their leisure. Some blame
shift-work ; others say they have no

a thing just couldn’t happen. Near the
alleged site of the deed, however, there

“Ercy”: On a Melbourne TV-pro-

sophisticated singer lolling against a post

ditty “Drifting and Dreaming.” In the
background a fully-rigged sailing-ship,
pint-sized, rocked gently in a zephyr
breeze. Midway through the verse the
ship gave a couple of nor’-easter rolls,
turned over and sank with scarcely a
gurgle. A disconcerted artist drifted and
dreamed the song out with more bravery
than nonchalance to a roar of laughter
from the audience.
TThey stood, hand in hand and hesi-
tant, outside the jeweller’s-shop

my mate, a bricklaying instructor at the
Tech., found a different approach neces-
sary to get P.A. (pre-apprenticeship)
boys interested in a trade that shows
every indication of dying-out through
lack of apprentices. He used to begin
by flicking up a trowelful of mortar,
spreading it with a flourish, tossing a
brick in his hand, “buttering” it, and
declaring: “It’s really quite easy.” The
boys seldom displayed any interest, and
he wondered why. Then inspiration
came: it looked easy—so easy that they
couldn’t see any skill in it. He has
changed to: “Now that looks dead
easy, doesn’t it? I’ll bet you can’t do it.”
Invariable result: a pushing, clamoring
circle of kids busting to demonstrate how
smart they are.

“Wusslean”: Before going on their

pyjama-clad young man emerge from a
sleeping-bag on the front-veranda and,
waving a blackened billy, ask for half-a-
pint. Milk-oh demanded an explanation,
either to him or to the police. Pyjamas
said he was a nephew of the Blanks and
had arrived from Sydney by car earlier
that morning, relying upon them to put
him up for the night, and now was
making the best of things by camping on
the porch. Documentary evidence of
identity having been produced, Pyjamas
received his half-pint, and the milkman
departed chalking-up an addition to his
list of queer customers.

Gnash her tatts or tear her hair,

When she heard of the affair.
Vocal protestations weren’t
In her line, for she had learnt
Of a better way to regulate their lives.
Best of arguments, she felt,
Could be made upon his pelt.
So she put reliance on her “bunch of

She was never the soft implier ;
Hers the phrase terse and direct.
She eschewed slang-whanging bout,

Instead of hurling plates at him, or
knives.
No. It wasn’t really a fight ;

New Guinea Highland Honks
The Indestructible Bike
By JACK LUSBY
1 1 t-ou’ll probably find a
\ motorbike th e r e,”
JL they said at Goroka.
“Peter used to get
around on it.”
Peter was my predecessor in
sole charge at a spot about 100
miles west. Flying in there it
looked anything but motorbike
country. Or aeroplane coun-
try. It looked spiked-boot
country. But ordinary rules
never got a start along the top
of New Guinea. Life beats on
in the unlikeliest vehicles: If
you’ve got faith in ’em they’ll
go.
Looking at the bike, I
decided I didn’t have that kind
of faith. The natives waved
their arms about, pointed at
the craggy horizons, and
assured me that “arafela
masta” had negotiated moun-
tain and stream on it. A yogi
gone troppo. Bed-of-nails
screwball!
The bike cropped-up fre-
quently in his day-by-day log.
Items like: “Rain continued,
bike stopped. Walked on 15
miles.” Or, jubilantly: “Bike
going ! Reached Kimil
area . .
In the journal this heap of
scrapiron emerged as a moody
but vital companion. A
hermit’s dog.
'T'here was no throttle-grip.
You hitched the cable
round your right wrist and
kept the pressure on. Painful
after an hour or so, but hardly
noticed in the natural hazards
and hawk-eye concentration
called-for hurtling along greasy
kanaka tracks, dodging gallop-
ing kanaka pigs, trying to keep
right-side-up going through the
creeks, trying to see through
the rain.
At first the headlamp hung
like a dying dahlia, and mud-
guards, passenger-grid and
silencer still clung to the frame.
Gradually all this non-
propellent deadweight rattled
loose and disappeared.
The horn honked loudly
when squeezed, and was of the
utmost importance. It made an
indelible impression on the
remoter natives, and would
stop a charging boar in his
tracks.
The fuel-ingredients ranged
from aviation 90-octane to
power-kero., mixed with a
variety of oils.
The bike’s performance was
hard to predict, but was usually
extraordinary. It occasionally
gave up the ghost in the face
of insurmountable geographi-
cal or meteorological pheno-
mena, but not once with an
empty tank. I assume it only
took a gargle of the stuff in
the tank when really desperate.
■JV/fY first ride turned out to be
purely local. The bike
reached a good speed going
downhill on the airstrip, and
the native “gate” seemed
greatly cheered to see its star
entertainer breathing fire and
smoke again.
However, long grass hid a
ditch about 6ft. deep and
handlebar - width, and we
battled gamely along the
bottom of this for some
distance.
The kanakas came hullooing
above-ground and found us
both in fair order and con-
dition.
They had some more fun the
same day. We were under way
again and going well, but on
fire. We were extinguished
with accurately flung mud.
The loudest laughers had to
clean the bike, which they did
with reverence. The bike was
out-and-out magic. Here even
the wheel was a mystery. For
sensation the bike left the
aeroplane miles behind. After
all, the plane looked like a
bird—why shouldn’t it fly like
a bird? But what did a motor-
bike look like?
Earth-tremors, gurias, were
frequent, and were attributed
to a chunky little underground
character who stamped around
rocking the boat. He was in a
rare old temper one day. The
guria shook people off their
feet, caused a small landslide
and did some damage. I rode
through the disturbance along
a normal stretch of the valley
highway. Patches of smooth-
going through avenues of
banana and casuarina, patches
of wild skidding on greasy clay,
spine - buckling corduroy
bridges, ejection-seat antics
over rocks and gutters, twisty
slopes where the ground fell
from sight in front or reared
like a wall.
I pulled-in at an Aussie
plantation.
“Pretty strong shake, eh?”
they said. “Bet that rattled
your teeth! ”
I had to admit I hadn’t felt a
thing. Missed a humdinger
guria through being on the
bike.
As often as not I’d find my-
self belting along flat-out
to beat the afternoon rain.
The rain could stop you in your
tracks. While it clouted you
on the head the mud would
claw you down from below.
If you got clear of the mud
onto clay you’d slide crazily
about and into a ditch or over
the side. Busters were a bob-
a-dozen.
The rain landed a king-hit
one afternoon, and mud
clogged the bike to a standstill.
It sported mudguards at the
time. I took these off, and
wore ’em round my neck, and
had another go, but conditions
didn’t favor progress. The bike
had become part of the good
earth.
I left it there to germinate,
and lifted my feet in and out
of the mud for several hilly
miles to the nearest haven.
Some keen young native
types set out to get the bike.
I told them to scrape-off the
mud and just push her along,
but knew it would be a lengthy
business. The natives had no
idea of steering a bike along
or turning it back from a suici-
dal high-dive. If it showed
stubbornness they simply let it
go, retrieved it and pushed on.
Progress was slow, but full of
incident.
This time the bike arrived
chuffing manfully in the centre
of the scrum. They’d pushed
it the whole way in gear, and
they’d done it in mortal fear
of the bike’s brusque belching,
which could have been censure,
approbation, or prelude to
some violent action.
T used to sit around trying to
* dream-up some way of
arriving at a destination look-
ing presentable. I never
achieved this. Time and time
again I’d start out impeccable
in whites, only to arrive like
something fresh from the
primeval slime.
Was invited to a Christmas-
dinner with a young American
missionary and his wife. Got
to within a few hundred yards
without a splash on me. The
last creek didn’t look much
different than usual, slithering
a couple of feet deep over
football-sized stones.
I decided on the full-blooded,
flat-out, fire-eating approach,
where you whipped your feet
up on the handlebars and
hoped to emerge dry on the

POLITICAL POINTS
Dr. Evatt’s “family policy” for the
forthcoming election, but not necessarily
for any Government he might lead after
the election, is summarised by himself as
follows:
An intensive stepping-up of home-
building; special loans for newly-married
couples to help them set-up house; hire-
purchase free from extortionate interest-
rates to be developed fully through the
Commonwealth Bank; doubled maternity
allowance; virtually doubled child-endow-
ment ; child-endowment for full-time
students up to 18; the commencement of
a plan for free dental treatment for children
under 16; a special committee with power
to examine adaptation of the principle of
Commonwealth scholarship scheme to
secondary- and technical-school students.
On top of that, age, invalid and widows’
pensions are to be raised by 10s.-15s. a
week. To finance these (and many other)
things he proposes to raid the Loan
Council’s appropriation of Budget funds
for public works, to divert the funds now
spent out of revenue on capital-works
(such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme),
to cut the defence appropriation and to
fill-up all the gaps left by these moves by
asking the Commonwealth Bank to
increase the Government’s overdraft to
the extent required. Financing public
works on 0.-d. is what his Treasury-bill
proposals really mean.
• •
The thing so patently fraudulent about
the Evatt prospectus for “reactivating the
economy” is that nowhere does he get
down to cases about the real cost in
terms of goods and services. You can’t
give some people something for nothing
without taking it from someone else —
unless you succeed in increasing the
overall level of productivity. Nowhere
does the Doctor talk about productivity.
He satisfies himself with the gag-line that
“Labor’s proposals are self-financing.”
What a quack to have around the House
at a time of economic difficulty like the
present!
• •
The Liberal party needs to take notice
that Evatt’s promises and plans, how-
ever lacking in practicality and good
faith, have had a wide “press.” The
Government’s public-relations efforts in
telling its own story have not been the
best.
• •
Something the Liberal party could
reasonably promise the electors would be
to remove the sales-tax from all food-
stuffs that go into an ordinary family
diet, including jellies and pastry. The
levying of tax on these things probably
dates back to the dark ages of the depres-
sion, but that doesn’t make it any more
rational. And sales-tax on a mattress,
for example, seems ridiculous.
• •
“Mugga Way”: When the Greek Arch-
bishop was being escorted from the
Grecian Ball in Sydney on October 14
he raised his hand in benediction to the
standing and silent crowd. One of the
official guests heard a curious fluttering
behind her. and turned round to see Clive
Evatt, M.L.A., waving vigorously,
apparently under the impression that the
Archbishop had greeted him, and him
alone. A familar Clive Evatt egoism,
such as when he argued with a wine-
taster at the R.A.S. as to whether a wine
was a chablis or a hock.
• •
Bolte’s request for special financial aid
to Victoria from the Commonwealth, on
the grounds that it is the State with the
greatest strains of national growth makes
it the fifth State to seek additional aid.
It is not expected in Victoria that there
will be an odd man out for long.

Mr. Dulles, who has flown from Rome
to the U.K. en route for Formosa, has

It seems that the Waterside Com-
munists have struck a snag in their levy
of ss. to pay the union’s costs in its
dispute with the Hurseys in Tasmania —
reported that about 500 wharfies in
Sydney have failed or refused to pay.
Nobody has suggested a levy on the
A.L.P., whose dire need of funds was the
original cause of the trouble —its pockets
are reputed to be as empty as ever in
history.

Unilever, the big soap, detergent and
food-handling concern, last Friday night
gave a dinner to all staff with over 25
years’ service simultaneously in Sydney,
Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and
Perth. Additional guests were those who
had just completed 15 years’ service, and
these were presented with a wrist-watch
It is to the credit of the relationship
which exists between management and
staff that, of the total Australian staff,
11.2 p.c. have had over 25 years’ service,
with the average highest in Adelaide
(19.2 p.c.) and Perth (16.8 p.c.).


• In its three-year life the 22nd Parlia-
ment sat for a total of a little over six
months. The House of Representatives
spent 1889 hours, spread over 190 sitting-
days, disposing of 299 bills. The records
suggest that the eagerness of Parliament
to conduct its business was at its peak
immediately after the 1955 elections,
declining annually.
In 1956 the House sat for 758 hours
over 79 days and passed 113 bills. This
pace slowed-down in 1957 —the House met
on only 63 days for a total of 640 hours
and the passage of 103 bills, while this
year, with elections in the offing, it dis-
posed of its business as quickly as
possible—B3 bills, dealt with in 48 days
for a total sitting-time of 491 hours.
It can be said, however, that when in
session Parliament sat for an average of
10 hours a day, which is slightly above
award conditions.

John McEwen, Deputy Prime Minister
and Leader of the FSderal Country party,
will speak in at least three Queensland
electorates during the election campaign.
Two, Herbert and Leichhardt, are Labor
seats ; the third, Wide Bay, is held by
Country-party member W. Brand, who
had a comfortable majority in 1955.
Edmonds (Labor) won Herbert by 3000
on that occasion, and there were also
2416 votes cast for a Communist candi-
date, so Labor should be able to hold the
seat fairly easily, unless a Q.L.P. candidate
pulls in a big swag of votes with prefs for
the Country party. Leichhardt, from which
the late H. A. Bruce retired at the close
of Parliament, is a different proposition,
and the Country party hopes to wipe-out
Labor’s last-time majority of 1261 to
gain the seat.

Paul Rotha, British TV-producer, told
a weekend seminar at Adelaide University
that TV, by adding sight to sound, could
create an international figure out of an
unknown person in half-an-hour. That
may be an exaggeration, but TV is
certainly given the credit for the remark-
able rise in the stocks of U.K. Prime
Minister Macmillan.
When Mac succeeded Eden he was
generally regarded as an able man, but
one lacking the color and warmth needed
to become popular with the public.
Unexpectedly he turned out to be a TV
“natural” —so much so that the Conserva-
tive Government which at the beginning
of 1957 seemed ripe for defeat is now
regarded as being capable of winning an
election whenever it chooses to spring
one.

In the current financial year 518 native
farmers in Papua and New Guinea will

Development of the “two towns” of
Canberra into one unified city, and the
fulfilment within 10 years of the original
plan, have been predicted by the National
Capital Development Commissioner,
J. W. Overall. The “Canberra Times,”
reporting an address on these lines by
Overall recently, introduced it by declar-
ing that he had said Canberra must be
made “a city to live in as well as a
national capital.” It would be worth-
while to have heard the comments on this
point from the transient politicians and
the current defence transferees.

Sites being investigated for a new
observatory as a subsidiary to Mt.
Stromlo, near Canberra, include the

The director of Stromlo, Professor Bart
Bok, said on his return from the Inter-

Moscow the other day that Australia
was likely to become the site of im-

In an anxious world there may be
something worth-while in the fact that
the French Premier, de Gaulle, last
month received the West German
Chancellor, Adenauer, in the intimacy of
his private home, situated in an area
of Europe (Lorraine) which for centuries
was a bone of contention between the
two nations, and near the Marne, a river
which has been one of the symbols of
murderous war between them. From
this place they proclaimed that it was
the destiny of the French and Germans
to live side by side in good mutual under-
standing, and that the “past traditional
enmity” had been surmounted and must
remain so.

During each day of the 13 years since
the end of the European war hundreds
of refugees have fled from the Soviet zone
of Germany (“the Workers’ Paradise”),
leaving their homes, their possessions,
and their jobs in search of freedom.
Recently the flood has swollen, in spite
of rigorous control-measures by the Com-
munists in the East, to five- or six-
thousand a week. More than two-million
have now fled from the Soviet zone, living
testimony to the extent of political terror
and oppression existing there. The tide
has now slackened to a “normal” 400
to 500 a day, but the problem of a divided
Germany is still acute for the whole of
Western Europe.

“Stromlo”: In a comment on the “dis-
appointingly low” standards of appli-
cants for cadetships at the Royal Military
College, Duntroon, the G.O.C. Central
Command, Major-General Bruton, said
the importance of the Army having its
proportion of Australia’s first-class young
men could not be overstressed. The
finer types of manhood should offer to
receive the training needed for future
leadership, he said. Perhaps a clearer
idea of the nation’s defence policy would
bring these types along.

Australia, which has claimed rights over
its own continental shelf and opposed the
Indonesian claim of a 12-mile territorial
limit, is supporting the Geneva-confer-
ence proposal for a second conference on
the general question of limits. External
Affairs Minister Casey told the U.N. the
other day that non-adoption at Geneva of
the “standstill agreement” proposal was
unfortunate, and that anarchy in coastal
waters was against the interests of inter-
national law and order. He urged the
early holding of a second conference,
after there had been enough preparatory
work to show the possibility of a conven-
tion on fair and acceptable lines.

“Mugga Way”: Dame Enid Lyons is

“S.”: According to the annual report
of the Victorian Licensing Court, hotels
are improving steadily, but the standard
of service generally depends on the
willingness and competence of the
licensee ; if he strives to satisfy his guests
he earns a good reputation. The com-
plaint of competent, modern Mine Hosts
is that the result of all their strivings and
earnings is greedily divided between the
State and Federal Treasurers and they’re
left holding the nearly empty till.

Wine-production in. South Australia
reached a record level in 1957-58, with
a total output of 26,400,000 gallons. But
the picture isn’t entirely rosy. Exports

other States. A few more bumper vint-

“R.R.D.”: In 1944 our regiment lay in
bivouac on the Roman Fields, training for the
assault on Hitler’s Gothic Line. I snatched
eight-hours’ leave in Rome and went straight
from a two-days’ exercise in the Sabine Hills
to the Vatican for an audience, previously
requested, with Pope Pius Xll. The audience-
chamber was thronged with English, American
and Italian soldiers, and, since we had some
time to wait, I watched from a seat beside
the empty papal throne the soldiers’ eager faces
and, in my mind, checked the turn-out of
the Swiss Guardsmen on duty round us, to
their detriment, I fear —here a morion worn
askew, there a gaiter frayed —against our own
“light bobs.” My thoughts were those of a
man at war.
Suddenly the atmosphere changed, and look-
ing over the heads of the soldiers I saw the
slender, white-clad figure of his Holiness borne
aloft upon a litter, with his smiling face turning
left and right as he gave his blessing to those
he passed by. When the bearers set the litter
down before the throne, he sprang from it
and up the steps with the economy of effort
and agility almost of a mountaineer. Then
he spoke, in Latin, in French and then a little
in English, carefully chosen words that meant
something to us all. He didn’t condemn the
Germans who had lately held him confined in
the Vatican, nor did he urge us to destroy them
or wish us luck in the battle he knew lay
ahead of us. He avoided the heroics we were
sick of hearing from politicians and generals,
and didn’t even go on the “Christian-soldier”
tack the padres used to take. Instead, he gave
us his blessing in a warfare between good and
evil, phrased simply, but delivered with look
and gestures which sealed its sincerity. Suddenly
the war made sense.
By his manner, a diplomat; by his speech,
scholar and leader; by his thought, beyond
ordinary men —that was the impression left on
us who faced no certainty beyond battle.

ABORIGINALITIES
TTere in W.A. shearers have been wear-
ing women’s hair-nets for years. My
shed is July shearing, and the rigout of
the blokes would rock old-timers.
Singlets and shorts, plus hair-nets. It’s
a pleasure to watch these fellows, ages
20 to 24, consistently knock-up tallies of
150 to 160 each for an eight-hour day.
This, too, not among nor’-west scrubbers
but southern woollies which average from
121 b. to 131 b. of wool. —“The Red Dam.”

“Payo”: While waiting for a freighter
to land on our local airstrip I watched a
lark giving her single offspring an outing.
On my approach a warning “Peep, peep!”
sent the young-’un to earth in a “freeze.”
It was not until some 20 minutes after I
had walked away that the hen approached
the chick, and, although a constant
chirruping was kept-up as she ran around
and even over it, no move was made by
the chick until it was given a tap by the
beak of authority, evidently the “all
clear”—the best example of avian
discipline I’ve noted.

“A.”: They’re having a bit of possum
trouble at Sydney’s St. Michael’s Church,
Vauciuse. The befurred acrobats invade
the organ-case, scurrying through the
pipe-work ; one of their favorite tricks
is to leap from pipe to pipe, landing
unerringly each time on the zinc tuning-
flap at the top of the pipe, thereby putting
’em all out of tune. The choristers have
been advised that no boy must watch or
cause attention to be drawn to the
possums’ presence during services ; this
edict followed a memorable wedding at
which, while the minister intoned prayers
over the newlyweds, a bushytail might
have been observed gently swinging from
the cross-beam overhead.

“Spin”: Timber seasoned in the log
(B. !7/9/’58)? When a party essayed
to exploit a forest of ebony in the Kim-
berleys in the early ’twenties they peeled
the trunks down to the heartwood and
shipped the cores to England, where the
timber was classed as equal to the world’s
best. But there was one fault —the logs
had cracked as they dried-out; and the
buyers, who were keen, weighed-in with
some advice: ebony should be seasoned
by steeping it in sea-water until it's cured.
They never got around to following the
advice because the Government of the
day imposed ridiculous conditions, such
as the establishment of sawmills on the
site, mess-huts, etc., and the project was
abandoned. But the advice (also the
ebony) is still there for anyone who cares
to try.

a tortoise (reputed to be 150 years old)

“Kelms”: Whenever I hear of parent
birds teaching their young to fly 1 men-
tion the rainbow-birds and pardalotes,
which nest in tunnels where instruction
would necessarily be limited. Lately I’ve
been watching a brood of wagtails take
the air. The first to leave the nest —it
may have been ejected by a parent —
crouched on the bough alongside for
the first day and screamed for tucker,
which it got. Next day it was hopping
along that bough and onto nearby twigs,
while its place near the nest was taken
by its nest-mate. The third day it was
flying or jumping from bough to bough',
and then it was chasing its parents across
the paddock, still cadging, but gradually
picking-up the trade for itself. There
was no question of the parents teaching
other than by example, and none was
needed. The idea that it is needed seems
to be based on a misconception—that
fledglings are afraid of heights. Why
should they be?

Paddocks wavering east and west,
Heat-hazed paddocks where dirty sheep
Crowd in the cool of a shady gum.
Gold-dusty paddocks, half asleep
Running away to kingdom-come ,
Doe-eyed Jerseys, taking their rest,
Chewing the cud in long dry grass,
Lazily look at us as we pass
Into the yellow end of day,
But the young store-cattle want to play
Want to chase and be chased again.
A dead lamb down in the bracken fern
And half-a-dozen slow black crows . . .
Paddocks on paddocks, heaven knows
How far this grassy commonwealth
goes,
Running away to the end of the world —
Ribbony roads unwound, uncurled,
With sun and sky and the endless
rhyming
Of wheels at one with the heat that stills
My thought, as I watch the shadow-
clouds climbing
Stealthily climbing the ash-blonde hills.

“Sebak” : While commending the pure-
mindedness of “Such’s” two old gents,
who decided it was a moth, not a butter-
fly, resting on the nude’s forefinger (B.
1/10/’5B), I deplore their entomology.
The creature can be identified as a butter-
fly beyond all dispute, and without resort
to a magnifying-glass, for a moth rests
with its wings folded along its sides
and a butterfly holds the wings aloft.

hours of painful practice during my child-

the crack is a supersonic bang produced
when the whip-cracker, at the height of
its “flick,” exceeds the speed of sound.
Well, it’s an ingenious theory.—“Mana-

“Stromlo”: Research by Queensland
University into the use of solar-heat for

“Mugga Way”: Melbourne dentist
Ken Mclntyre, who lately did a six-
months' shift with the Flying Doctor
Service in the Kimberleys, found up
there that eating soft whitefella tucker
was ruining the abos.’ teeth, especially
amongst the youngsters. At isolated
missions, where the natives still eat their
own kinds of tucker, the teeth of the
young-'uns are excellent. One old
woman who had lived on native diet
all her life had teeth which, though
ground-down to the gums, were still
sound.

“Kelms”: When a York (W.A.) farmer
got back from the Show his truck and
37 bales of wool had gone-off. He was
amazed, not that the thieves had been
able to commit the crime—the truck and
wool were there in the shed —but that
anyone would think wool worth lifting
at the ruling price. The same thought
must have struck the thieves, because a
couple of days later the truck with the
wool on board was found in a Fre-
mantle street. The truck was licensed
to hold only 18 bales, and it had been
assumed the thieves had made two trips,
but there was the truck with the whole
37 bales on it. So‘now the heat's really
on —overloading a vehicle’s a serious
crime in W.A-.
“Kurnai”: In the now-industrialised
Latrobe Valley (Vic.) the Prince’s High-
way crosses a low, heathy range known
as the Haunted Hills. The name sprang
from a legend of the droving-davs (before
the railway went through in the
’seventies), when every week bullocks
from Gippsland stations crossed these
hills to the fat-cattle pens at Newmarket.
The drovers invariably traversed them in
daylight because of tales told of cattle
stampeding at night through some
mysterious cause —restless hooves, it was
said, made the peculiar hollow sound
which sent them on a mad rush. But
the late John Rintoul, who knew the old
Gippsland track like the back of his
hand —as a lad he helped his father
hold-down the contract of shoeing all
Cobb and Co.’s horses based between
Warragul and Sale —told me that a
different species of spirits led to the
nocturnal avoidance of the hills by
drovers. He said the hills were the home
of many illicit stills, .the owners of which,
to keep nosey beef-conductors from
poking into nooks and corners looking
for cattle which strayed from the night-
camp, spread the story of bovine hob-
goblins, to good purpose.

“Beezle-Beezle”: A pub in the N.S.W.
Riverina changed hands, the new licensee
being a naturalised southern European.
A half-caste came to tell me the news.
“Now,” he said, “I can have a drink
there. He won’t be able to refuse to
serve a man the same color.” And, as
a matter of fact, the new proprietor was
a shade, darker.

“Looksee”: The maggies had built
their nest on a fence-post, and we had
wondered why it hadn’t been blown off.
Our mailman explained. He couldn’t
bear to watch the maggies put all that
effort into a home that looked so
insecure, so he lent them a hand by
twisting a length of wire-netting around
the post. Last peep showed Ma Mag.
sitting on three eggs.

“Banana”: Shared the back of a ute
up Townsville way for 30 miles with a
bronzed woman dressed as if for a State
function. The trip was rough and windy,
and she, grimly clutching with hands and
knees a large carton branded “Fragile,”
had no time to spare for her wildly-
fluttering attire. Not a word was spoken
until the ute pulled-up to let me disem-
bark, whereupon my travelling com-
panion, making a grab at the dainty con-
fection of flowers, net and what-have-you
skewered to her hair, turned to me with
a polite smile and said, “This bloody
veil!” Recounting this later to the other
woman who had driven the ute,
I pointed out an item in my reading-
matter where Sir Arthur Fadden declares
that the future of North" Queensland is
backed by the outstanding character of
its people. “Good Heavens,” she cried,
“don’t take any notice of Mrs. ; she’s
a South Queenslander!”


One of the most timid of birds js the
land-curlew, alias the stone-plover.
Secretive, elusive, it becomes wild as a
banshee once the veil of its camouflage
of protective coloring has been torn
aside. .Yet when we lived on Molle
Island my wife, had a regular flock of
them which dropped their shyness when-
ever she appeared. Those sprites of the
bush would drift like grey ghosts oyer
the ground towards her, then encircle
her, dance, play the fool by pretending
they were somewhere else, and some of
them would even dare to try to lift up
their voices in what passed for song with
them. They’d cluster about her feet
when she scattered food for them, race
on their stilts of legs, and almost turn
somersaults in appreciation of her
patronage. But they were very selective ;
if anyone else went near them those
“Oops —did that hurt?"
fowl would dissolve into nothingness by
remaining perfectly still.—“ Flight.”

“Paddy Doyle”: Re “Apemantus’s”
query on origin of “No good to Gundy”
(B. 17/9/’sB)—Gundy is a minute
hamlet a few miles east of New England
Highway in the Murrurundi district,
Long ago the plotting of a proposed
road produced a heated discussion among
the Bumbles of the shire council, one of
whom hailed from Gundy. When it
became obvious that the Gundyites’ pro-
posals were on the losing end their
champ, concluded an impassioned speech
with “All I can say, it’s no good to

“K.1.N.”: On Warbreccan station

of months later, taking mares to the

the foal, which ran in to meet the mob.
He was ill-nourished and looked a real
guttersnipe. When Volley sighted him

Hospital in Sydney is the site of Eugene
Dominique Nicolle s ice-works, which he
operated almost a century ago. He
“exported” large quantities as far afield
as Brisbane and Rockhampton. Water
for the plant was drawn from a “never-
failing crystal spring” behind the factory.
The ground-floor was hewn out of solid
rock, and the rear approach, by means
of a long ramp, is still called Ice Street.
In 1867 Nicolle co-operated with Thomas
Sutcliffe Mort, who conceived the idea
of exporting chilled-beef. Mort built
freezing-works at Lithgow (N.S.W.) with
a view to supplying Sydney with beef,
but the venture failed. After a false
start in beef exportation, Nicolle in 1879
sailed for London in the steamer Strath-
leven, which successfully carried a cargo
of frozen meat. Nicolle died in 1910.
His granddaughter lives at Hamilton

“Myall”: “Manamoi’s” notion that
crows would perch on the head of a
gun-firing scarecrow within a day or two
of its erection (B. 17/9/’5B) is contrary
to my experience. During the last dry
spell hundreds of cockatoos and crows
invaded my heavy crop of sorghum,
just ripening. I placed a carbide-gun in
the paddock, and at the first shot a cloud
of birds arose and made for the timber
at the edge of the cultivation. After
a few minutes some of the hardier ones
glided back into the crop just as the
second bang hit the air. That settled
the sulphur-crests, and they left for
parts unknown. The crows stuck it out
until the fourth encore, when they, too,
threw in the towel. The guj was kept
there till the crop was harvested, and
none of either band of robbers returned
to the attack.

Good to see the The Bulletin giving
prominence to Sydney High's 75th
birthday, and listing its ex-pupils who
were sufficiently endowed to bring
prominence upon themselves. Now how
about a word for an ordinary school in
an average N.S.W. country town?
Singleton Public School—Hunter Street
to those who attend it will be 100
years old this year ; the party is to last
a week, and the whole Hunter Valley
will know it. Some ex-pupils have
achieved fame; most are still found
battling with droughts, floods, agents and
other ills which afflict mankind ; they
congregate on market-days, show-days,
at football-matches and funerals —ancl
the long ranks that swing down Hunter
Street To the Dawn Service on Anzac
Day are crammed, with them.
The party will have something for
everybody, including a Centenary Con-
cert by the present youngsters and a
Centenary Ball —no official silvertail
party, but a gathering of all the old-
timers who can roll up; we guarantee
to believe any story they care to tell.
The. Week will conclude with a rip-
snorter procession and sports programme.
All ex-pupils and -teachers please re-
port back for duty third week in
November. If you’d like a programme
of the doings, and your accommodation
arranged, just send your name, address
and vintage to the present Headmaster

REVERSE TO FREAK SHAREMARKET
A ustralia’s freak share-
market has taken a shaking
these last few days, and not
before its time. Logically
enough, it has been the “too-
blue chips’’ that have had the
worst pasting.
But they are still priced high
enough to show very low
yields.
In spite of the fact that the
market reverse, in general, was
the most severe for
several years, shares show-
ing good yields or offer-
ing prospects of income-
improvement in the near future
stood their ground better than
the tall poppies—the chosen
of the institutional investors
and those private investors
following in their wake in
search of “market-increment.’’
It may be that the higher-
yielding second - liners will
suffer a delayed reaction and
follow the front-liners down
after a few days ; but it is not
entirely logical or inevitable
that they should.
Glamor Stocks
The most freakish influences
in the recent “boom in the best’’
have affected the glamor stocks
of the front line, forcing
immediate yields down well
below 4 p.c. and sometimes
below 3 p.c. It is logical that
these stocks should take the
steepest tumble, as they have
done.
As is usual in the case of a
stubbornly optimistic share-
market boom, warning-flags
which have been flying for
months have been generally
ignored by the sharemarket,
and last week’s reverse, which
was triggered-off by a long-
delayed recognition of the effect
of lower wool and metal prices
on the Australian economy,
might have easily happened
months ago on the internal evi-
dence of the sharemarket itself.
Freak sharemarket influences
have existed in Australia for
many months past. Miserable
yields have been accepted by
investors from front-rank
stocks—yields far too low to
live with in the long-run.
Mostly these investors had high
hopes of “market-increment”
in the end outweighing the
lowness of the yields. But this
dependence .on “increment,”
where arithmetical analysis of
a stock’s prospects doesn’t fully
“Escapist stuff.”
warrant it, is a trap almost as
obvious as that stepped into by
those following-up a mining-
share boom.
Market Anomalies
The “increment - seeking’’
boom was superimposed on an
anomalous condition of affairs
where a public company which
invests in the shares of another
comp-~y does 'not pay tax on
dividends received from that
company, which means that a
company investing in shares
listed on ’Change can afford to
accept a lower yield than a per-
sonal investor.
Other factors tending to send
prices of certain selected shares
up have been the buying
of industrial equities by
unit-trusts and staff provident
funds, and the shortage of new
share-issues by listed companies
because they can ease their own
tax-burden by raising capital in
the form of notes and deben-
tures rather than by shares. It
it a long time indeed since
Australian sharemarkets
suffered from indigestion aris-
ing from a surfeit of new issues.
Scrip Shortage
A bottleneck in the supply of
good-class equity shares has
appeared to exist in conditions
of recent extraordinary
demand, and this rather exag-
gerated demand has been
topped-off by speculation as to
the extent to which this bottle-
neck would force share prices
to greater artificial heights.
But these sharemarket condi-
tions by themselves in no way
improved the profit-earning
prospects of the companies con-
cerned, or justified the low
yields which investors were
forced to accept when they
paid such prices.
The Future
All these points were made
in Bulletin comments on the
sharemarket a long time prior
to last week’s slump ; but it is
as well to go over them again
in order to assess the position
as it stands now and is likely
to develop in the near future.
Last week’s crash seemed to
generate in Sydney, where res-
ponsible sharebroking opinion
has been sceptical of the high
prices offering for glamor
stocks for some time. Then it
spread to Melbourne, where
various authorities - have
recently spoken in support of
high share prices.
The position now is that it is
a better time to buy shares
than it was a fortnight ago.
Prices for some stocks have
dropped considerably, and the
prospects of profitmaking by
companies in their ordinary
way of business is unlikely to
be any worse than it was
before the sharemarket drop.
But all shares need to be
valued individually and with
regard to the changed economic
circumstances that have been
evident not for two weeks but
for at least six months.
Regard must be given to
yields offering now and prob-
able in the immediate future.
Last week’s shakeout should
make it clear to the speculator
that to depend upon market-
increment for a living is a
chancy business, and that it can
lead to financial disaster if
relied upon too confidently.
If prices were too high before
the drop —and it is the opinion
here that many shares were
much too high—then at today’s
lower levels these shares are
nearer to their true value. And
it is a fact that many of the
comparatively neglected stocks
were, at the height of the share-
boom, worth their full price.
A stabiliser—or stimulator
—in the sharemarket is
likely to continue in the
shape of the unit-trusts and
other institutional investors.
More unit-trusts are now enter-
ing the field, some with the
support of the big banking insti-
tutions. But the personal
investor will be wise to seek the
kind of investment cloth that
will cut best to his own figure,
and of a pattern that he won’t
find difficult to wear for a con-
siderable time should market
fashions go against him.
In other words, an invest-
ment that is remunerative in
itself, regardless of the market.

The
advantages
of a
cheque account
with the
“Wales”
Among the many advantages of a cheque
account are the time and trouble saved in
making payments, the safety of paying by
cheque rather than by cash, and the complete
and permanent record of payments provided
by your cheque butts and bank statements.
In addition, many services are available to
all “Wales” customers including:—
Travel service. The “Wales” will plan and
arrange your travel anywhere in the world.
Travellers’ cheques and letters of credit provide
the safest and most convenient means of travel
finance.
Gift cheques enable you to give the most
acceptable gift money in an attractive form.
Different cheques are available for weddings,
birthdays, Christmas, and general purposes.
Sending money. You can send money quickly
and easily by mail, air mail, telegram, or cable
anywhere in the world (subject to exchange control
regulations).
BANK OF
NEW SOUTH WALES

the basis of a payment by the
client of not less than £lO
weekly, fortnightly, monthly,
quarterly, etc. When the client
has paid for 100 shares or other
stipulated parcel, transfer-docu-
ments will be sent to him. In
the meantime shares will be
held by a nominee company. A
client may cancel the un-
executed part of an order with-
out penalty.
The client's account will be
booked with the number of
shares, including fractions to
three decimal places, bought by
each instalment at the market
price on the day after the instal-
ment is credited to the client’s
account.
Dividends will be credited to
the client’s account and
reinvested (£lO and over).
Rights to new issues may be
either sold or taken-up.
Normal brokerage rates will
apply to all instalment-pur-
chases.
Already individual instal-
ment - investment plans are
being operated by four Sydney
brokers. There are also brokers
in Adelaide and Brisbane
operating these plans.
It is a “pay-as-you-go”
system, but the instalment-
investor has exactly the same
advantages and obligations
possessed by the ordinary
investor, save that no voting-
rights are available until the
shares held in trust are trans-
ferred to him.
One of the attractions of the
scheme is that it is a form of
planned saving, and it should
make an appeal to many people
who feel that the purchase of
100 shares in any of the
sounder companies in one
transaction is too much for
their pocket.
It is a highly desirable thing
that investment interest in our
industries and financial enter-
prises should be spread through
the community as far as pos-
sible.
Time to Buy Now?
A s mentioned elsewhere in
these pages, the drop in
share prices last week did not
affect the second-line stocks
showing a reasonable yield so
much as it did the front-liners
offering a low return.
But after the shakes had
steadied, most of the leaders
still did not show a satisfactory
immediate yield, many offering
a return of lower than 4 p.c.,
even allowing for the reduction
in price.
These yields have to be con-
sidered with care. Though the
security of the company from
which they are being obtained
may be beyond question, the
maintenance in the market of
the price paid by the optimistic
speculator may be by no means
assured.
It is difficult to find obvious
examples of shares showing
yields around 6 p.c. with reason-
able security and promising
prospects, but Bradford Cotton
(6 p.c.) appears to be among
these, especially in view of the
textile trade’s acknowledgement
that Japanese competition has
not been troublesome, and the
fact that restrictions on imports
are likely to become more pro-
nounced than otherwise.
There are. other stocks, such
as Gadsden Hughes, offering
over 5 p.c. and which should
do well even if economic condi-
tions become tighter than they
are now. It is well worth while
studying the various stocks
analytically and assessing indi-
vidual merits rather than
following a general market
trend.
The front-liners still so high
in the market, and which are
now generally ploughing-back
part of their profits in order
to finance business-expansion
and consequently not distribut-
ing those profits currently to
shareholders, should one day
show the cumulative benefit of
this type of internal finance.
But in some cases the “paying-
off” time is far away indeed,
and the investor should ponder
well the matter of whether he
can afford to wait long enough
for that paying-off, and what is
likely to happen in the mean-
time.
It is still a time for selective
investment based on analysis of
the merits of individual stocks
as those merits apply to the
individual investor.
An Attractive New Loan
CJpecial bonds being issued by
the Commonwealth during
the current cash-and-conver-
sion operations have many
attractions for the medium-
sized and small investor.
First of the three unusual
features of the special bond is
that the holder may cash it on
one month’s notice after the
first interest-date. Second is
that the interest-rate rises at
intervals over its seven-year
term. Third is that it is repay-
able at a premium if held for
three years or more.
Interest is 4 p.c. for the first
two years, 44 p.c. for the next
two years and 5 p.c. for the
final three.
The £lOO bonds are repayable
at par if cashed within the first
three years, at £lOl during the
next two years, £lO2 for the
next two years, and at £lO3 if
held until maturity.
This means that if the bonds
are held for the full seven years
a total of £32 will be received
in interest on a £lOO bond, plus
£3 in premium, making a total
of £35 for the seven years,
which is equal to 5 p.c. p.a. at
simple interest.
Though there is a slight dis-
advantage, on a compounding
basis, of interest on interest in
the early years compared with
a bond issued at 5 p.c. flat and
at par, in effect these special
bonds are a 5 p.c. security
though issued for the short
term of seven years, whereas

the normal 5 p.c. issue has a
currency of 16 years.
Furthermore, the special
bond can be realised for at least
par at almost any time, and the
premium payable on cashing it
Mill be regarded as tax-free
income except in cases where
the holder is a person or firm
classed as a trader in securities
and shares. The normal in-
vestor will collect the £l, £2, or
£3 premium (depending on the
date of cashing the bond) tax-
free, and of the interest
received on the loan, the usual
2s. in the £ is tax-free also,
There is a limit—£sooo—on
the amount of the special loan
which any one person may
hold. But within that limit it is
the most attractive Common-
wealth bond issued by the
Treasury for a long time.
The other loans being offered
at present are a short-term one
(4 p.c., maturing May, 1960,
issued at £99 15s ), a medium-
term one (4j p.c.; February,
1967, issued at £99 55.), and the
long-term 5 p.c. (maturing in
September, 1974, issude at par).
The special loan is a wise
development at this time
because there are 270,000 indi-
vidual holders of the maturing
loans, a far greater number of
comparatively small investors
than in any Commonwealth
conversion operation for many
years.
New TV Licences
'T'he approval of new com-

will be national stations also in
every State.
In Brisbane one licence went
to Brisbane TV, Ltd., principal
shareholders in which are
Queensland Newspapers Pty.,

Ltd. (ATN Channel 7,. of
Sydney), General Television
Corporation Pty., Ltd., of Mel-
bourne, and “Truth” and
“Sportsman,” Ltd., are the
chief shareholders.
In Adelaide one licence was
granted to Southern Television
Corp., Ltd., in which The
News, Ltd., will be the main
shareholder, and the other to
Television Broadcasters, Ltd.,
in which the main shareholder
will be Advertiser Newspapers,
Ltd.
Perth’s licence goes to TVW,
Ltd., in which West Australian
Newspapers, Ltd., and the
W.A. public will have about
equal shareholdings, and the
Hobart station will be run by
Tasmanian Television, Ltd., in
which Davies Bros., Ltd., pub-
lisher of Hobart “Mercury,”

Barenboim
The 15 - year - old Israeli
pianist wound-up a season of
astonishing virtuosity with an
all-Beethoven programme in
Sydney. The four sonatas
chosen included two of the
“greats”—Op. 101 in A Major,
and the “Waldstein,” Op. 53 in
C Major.
The young pianist brought to
the A Major remarkable musi-
cal insight, nowhere better
accented than in his treatment
of the extended and menacing
fugato in the final allegro, and
in the great climax, where there
is a dramatic reappearance of
the main subject in the original
key.
The “M oonli g h t” was
remarkable for the dropping of
the tempo in the opening sec-
tion to a more deliberate pace
than this commentator has
heard before—a slowness which
certainly gained for the second
part a greater dramatic con-
trast. The presto was all fury,
yet every note emerged with
fine clarity.
The “Pathetique,” Op. 13,
was also notable for the
extremely slow march of the
gloom-ridden grave; while the
“Waldstein” rounded - off a
magnificent concert, with the
concluding rondo a true tour-
de-force.

“Femmes and Furs”
The Merry Macs, who have
star billing in Sydney Tiv's
current programme, present
simple songs in admirable har-
mony of voices style and ges-
tures. The practised ease of
their stage presentation is half
the attraction —as with the hat-
changing nonsense while none
of them misses a beat of “Pass
the Biscuits, Mirandy”—and
their precision-style singing is
the other half. The total is
highly entertaining.
A dynamic negress, Fredye
Marshall, might well have been
listed as the “main feature” on
the strength of her vocal range
alone —thick, low and sultry all
the way up to notes which
sound as clear and brittle as
glass. Standing what appears
to be all of a good sft. lOin. or
more, she sang “Basin St.
Blues” and others of the same
vintage, to the nostalgic delight
of most of the audience. She
could have gone on singing all
night for most people’s money.
Simone Monin, “the girl in
the goldfish bowl,” is the first
stripper present commentator
has seen to disrobe underwater,
and the muscular feats and fool-
ings of Max and Cherie are as
good-natured as they are agile.
Terry Scanlon comperes the
show, using, it seemed, the same
jokes as he has before —or
maybe it’s just that we’ve
heard them all before . . .
except the one about the
youth who wanted a “Cornel
Wilde” haircut, and found his
head being shaved to the tune
of the barber's assurance that
he’d seen the film five times.
“What film?” “The King and
I.”

Opera in Melbourne
Now that all Melbourne is
swirling and delighting in the
grip of opera and grand opera
Stage and Musk
“Lola Montez”
Fossicking for an Australian
musical comedy, the Australian
Elizabethan Theatre Trust has
come upon a likely color in
“Lola Montez,” which has had
a run in Melbourne and Bris-
bane before hitting Sydney this
week. There are promises here
of a real find—the songs
“Southerly Buster,” “Saturday
Girl,” “Lady, Lady, Please
Don’t Cry,” and “The Wages of
Sin’’ fell far more gratefully on
this commentator’s ears than
many a number from recent
Broadway deportations to Aus-
tralia.
Impressive or witty dance-
routines, such as “There’s Gold
in Them Thar Hills,” and that
potential show-stopper “Wages
of Sin,” in which the local
“girls” of Ballarat deplore the
falling-off in takings since Lola
hit town, suggest that in both
song and dance “Lola”- is
splendidly equipped. Atmos-
phere is often achieved in cos-
tumes and sets, except for an
unnecessary, peripatetic tree-
stump and (in the Brisbane per-
formance) a veritable
“southerly buster” of back-
stage din at every scene-change.
Where does the dissatisfac-
tion with the comedy lie, then?
It simply doesn't seem of a
piece. Hampered by a conven-
tional, unimaginative script, the
action is never smooth, and the
music seems to waver between
the newer American style of
musical comedy and the earlier,
static one. For example, the
song - and - dance routine
“Southerly Buster” sets the
mood of hot-day lethargy, yet
nowhere throughout the show
does the script offer any justi-
fication for this number. The
best tunes in that model show
“Oklahoma!” advance the
action and mood as well as
being good in their own right.
Most of these discrepancies
in style and pace seem to centre
around the character of Lola
herself, and apart from a
superbly conceived “Spider
Dance,” Lola doesn’t make her
mark in the piece.
For all the vivacity and
stylish dancing that 'Mary
Preston brought to the role,
Lola remained far less interest-
ing than any of the “girls” she
had deprived of a living. And
her singing style seemed to
evoke memories of a Florrie
Forde rather than a mistress of
Ludwig of Bavaria.
Jane Martin and Michael
Cole, as the young lovers, were
a happy team, the latter often
successfully substituting per-
sonal for vocal charm. It was
left to Frank Wilson, as Lola's
American agent, to realise for
us the only person in the piece,
although John Auld and Alan
Hopgood could not have been
bettered in their little studies.
“Lola Montez” is raw, but
there are highly satisfactory
“colors” in it. It needs washing,
a lot of smelting and running
off of slag, to make it acceptable
as international currency, but
only a fool would abandon it
at this stage. Radio co-opera-
tion to make its better tunes
familiar is urgently needed if it
is to receive the attention due
to it by an Australian public.

it might be asked, “What will
finally emerge as the memor-
able moments of the season?”
Will they be the brain-children
of immortals like Beethoven
and Rossini, or mortal things
like Mr. Haag and his produc-
tions?
This reviewer finds it hard
to forget the dark, almost
aggressive single set in
“Fidelio” ; easier to forget the
not-so-wonderful performance
of the Victorian Symphony
Orchestra and the fine, con-
trolled and accurate singing of
Sylvia Fisher.
Again, in the case of “The
Barber” a lavish and intricate
two-storied set and bursts of
professional polish in the acting
rather than in the singing would
surely not have roused “Oh-
aahs” from Rossini. Yet amidst
all this, “Fidelio” and “The
Barber” did not flounder—far
from it. Haag and Karl Rankl,
the musical director, were
mostly in accord with each
other and often with Messrs.
Beethoven and Rossini. At these
times the results were little short
of magnificent. Alan Light sang
with fine tone and excellent
enunciation as Don Pissaro,
Madge Stephens aired a warm
soprano, and Glenda Raymond
sang with lilting coolness and
made great play with Rossini
burlesque.
“Carmen” came off the pro-
duction-belt a rather stereo-
typed replica of Italian models,
but without much of the Italian
flamboyancy and with little of
Spanish passion. There was
more of that commodity in the
acting and singing of Constance
Shacklock than in any of the
others. As the delinquent
cigarette-girl, she sang with
feeling and acted with pertness.
Don Jose Nilsson was an
apologetic corporal of dragoons,
and Robert Simmons a full-
voiced but not sufficiently full-
chested Escamillo. Joy
Mammen had tenderness and
pathos as that symbol for pure
love, Michaela, but her dream
of a lifetime of marital felicity
with Don Jose had very little
interest for an audience which
was out for an exciting evening
with the unlawful loves of
Carmen and Escamillo.
Producer Sumner’s sets
looked like and possibly were
made of paper, and his crowd
scenes were less super-spectacles
than crowds of supers.

Pakarek and Nikolaidi
The music of Respighi has
been making colorful splashes
across the last two or three
Brisbane concert seasons, and
with the performance of
“Church Windows,” done for
the first time in Australia under
Rudolf Pekarek’s direction, the
Queensland Orchestra has now
played all the major works of
this composer.
Respighi took the large
orchestra bequeathed by the
19th century and used it to
write musical pageants of the
splendors of Italian history.
His rich scoring has the trick
of making a medium-sized
orchestra like the Queensland
one sound fuller than usual,
and this suite was no exception.
It attempts to translate religious
scenes into music, and in many
places succeeds in imparting
an atmosphere of mystery and
drama. But it lacks the broad
themes of some of the better-
known Respighi pieces, and its
elaborate sounds do not quite
make up for this. Its gentler
sections were very lovely, and
the final pomp of the scene des-
cribing the religious cere-
monials of Rome was most
impressive. It was apparent,
though, that Respighi’s inven-
tion was running out, for the
ceremonial music was not far
removed from the sounds he
had used not many years before
to represent the pagan Roman
legions tramping down the
Appian Way.
The rest of the orchestral
part of the programme was on
a big scale. Wagner’s “Master-
singers Overture” made a wel-
come reappearance to whet our
appetites for the whole opera,
and Brahms was represented by
his Fourth Symphony. Some
of the playing here was
movingly beautiful, especially
in the slow movement, and in
the shadows that fall across the
high spirits of the boisterous
third movement. Only in the
finale did the tragic element
of the music seem overstressed.
This is music that is detested
by some music-lovers, admired
by others. Superficially a set of
variations on the rising chords
heard at the beginning, Brahms
makes of it a musical structure
of some magnificence. The late
James Agate said that saying a
dull thing many times over does
not make it any less dull, but
that hardly applied to this per-
formance, in which the varia-
tions were closely knit together
into a fascinating web of sound.
The return of the main theme
could have been less melan-
choly, though, for the brass
handled it too carefully instead
of ringing it out for all they
were worth.
Elena Nikolaidi sang three
songs, and, if it is about time
singers were given something
better to do at orchestral con-
certs than two or three quite
unrelated operatic arias, she
had a lovely tone, particularly
in a Rossini piece that nearly
turned her into a coloratura
soprano. A Greek folksong
that finished her part of the
programme was a gem, and
quite unexpected among the
heavyweights that made up the
rest of the concert.

Sydney Art
Farmer’s revived and reno-
vated Blaxland Galleries, with
their polished wood floors, their
indirect lighting, their elegant
grey walls and their general
spaciousness, seem to have
made the Contemporary Art
Society’s exhibition strangely
respectable . . . even though
one of the paintings is
a gentleman hanging upside-
down by his heels and
one of the sculptures, a
wooden bird, has, probably for
the first time in the history of
this art, laid an egg.
But no doubt it is largely
the paintings themselves which
are responsible for this impres-
sion of tameness and sameness.
The reason for this, of course,
is that abstraction and even
surrealism as most painters
practise it are extremely limited
modes of expression. The
human mind can really invent
very little ; it is Nature that has
infinite diversity.
But even within the limits of
abstraction the great weakness
of this exhibition as a whole is
the absence of light within the
pictures themselves. Light,
whether natural or contrived,
is just as practicable and just
as essential to dramatise the
painting in an abstract as in
any other form ; and where it is
absent, as it is here all along
the wall, the paintings lie flat
and dead ; at best mere decora-
tive patterns.
It is the presence of light, a
great white whirling globe of it,
rather than merely the size of
the painting, which makes
Thomas Gleghorn’s “Evening,
Nullarbor” stand out. It is a
loose piece of work compared
with some of his earlier, archi-
tectural abstracts ; and it is dis-
appointing to find that dusk on
the Nullarbor Plain is exactly
the same black and green as
dusk at Circular Quay ; buf it
has force.
What the N. S. Wales
National Gallery is going to do,
however, with all these enor-
mous oils it is buying for
enormous prices (150 guineas
for “Nullarbor”) will set a


pretty puzzle for the future.
The gallery will certainly be
paved with good intentions.

“Orders to Kill”
A bomber-pilot, temporarily
grounded after distinguished
service, is seconded to Security
because of special qualifica-
tions. After exacting training
he is parachuted into Nazi-
occupied France with orders to
kill a French Resistance man
who, British Intelligence
believes, is betraying his fellows
to the Gestapo.
When he meets his intended
victim, a mild-seeming family
man of kindly manner, he
doubts that such a man could
possibly be a traitor, but he is
argued down by a strong-
minded woman leader of the
Resistance who is his contact.
He carries out the assignment,
but the obviously bewildered
“Why?” uttered by his dying
victim so haunts him he be-
comes a temporary alcoholic.
Later, when he discovers that
his intuition was right and the
man was innocent, he is
brought to reluctant reconcilia-
tion by arguments that in war
the innocent suffer with the
guilty, and that this mistake
was in effect no different from
his inevitable killing of
innocents in his former capacity
as bomber-pilot.
The story is intelligently
handled, and Paul Massie
cleverly effects the change from
a carefree, confident man to the
mentally-disordered victim of
war. Irene Worth brings cold
calculation and intensity to the
role of the dedicated Resistance
woman avenging the loss of a
son ; and Eddie Albert and
James Robertson Justice are
neatly competent as the men
who train the pilot in the art of
swift, and silent killing.

“Carve Her Name With
Pride”
There is understanding and
compassion in the telling of this
gripping, fact-based story about
a British woman agent who was
posthumously awarded the
George Cross for gallantry.
Viol e 11 e Szabo, English
widow of a French officer, is
parachuted into occupied
France with other secret-service
agents to help stiffen the French
Resistance. Caught, she is tor-
tured by the Nazis in an attempt
to wring from her a quotation
which will help them break the
agents’ code ; when this fails
she goes to the firing-squad.
Sentiment is balanced, and
there are no mock-heroics ; ten-
sion and action run hand-in-
hand ; and the climactic epi-
sodes are excellent.
Virginia McKenna draws a
very likeable portrait of the
heroine, carrying an easy
dignity and resourcefulness,
though not without very human
fears. Paul Scofield, as her
co-agent, makes an impressive
first appearance.

“The Bravados”
The theme of this western
has a similar point to that of
“Keep thy distance, wicked Sir Lance, or I'll throw
myself from yonder window."
“Orders to Kill” —in this case
a rancher whose wife has been
raped and murdered during his
absence relentlessly hunts a
party of four outlaws whose
description he has been given.
He kills three, and his final
intended victim proves beyond
doubt that they were not the
four who committed the crime.
The avenger is honored by the
townfolk who had been
terrorised by the outlaws, and
left to reconcile his conscience
with the fact that, though they
deserved to die, personal ven-
geance was his only motive.
Gregory Peck gives a sound
portrayal as the rancher, but
Joan Collins, as an old love
who seeks to be his second
wife, merely clutters-up the
action. There is some superb
scenery, and director Henry
King produces sharply drawn
characters and maintains
excellent tensions.

“Seven Thunders”
The imaginative and realistic
denouement of this British film
about two war-prisoners on the
loose in Marseilles is rather out-
weighed by the melodramatic
and time-lagging sequences of
the first hour. Stephen Boyd is
far more at home in red-
blooded action than in trying to
breathe life into the tepid
romance, which does little more
than hold up the action.

“The Law and Jake Wade”
Suspense is skilfully held in
this tiptop western, photo-
graphed against a superb back-
ground of snow-covered moun-
tains ; the characters are never
allowed to degenerate into
puppet-figures ; and the atmos-
phere of bleak malevolence
which surrounds the story is
well maintained.
Robert Taylor, town marshal
and ex-robber, is kidnapped
with his fiancee by his former
partner-in-crime (Richard Wid-
mark) and some henchmen and
forced to lead them to where
he had hidden the proceeds of
an old hold-up. It develops into
a suspenseful waiting-game,
and the climax has power and
not a little originality.
Taylor, still leanly athletic,
barks in the staccato phrases
he has made his stock-in-trade
for outdoor films, and Widmark
sticks effectively to his smiling,
lazy air of menace. Patricia
Owens, as the hostage,
decorates the rugged scenery.

A rather clumsy suspense-
thriller, this is about a young
American doctor who, hearing

arrives she is dead, and his
wearisome amateur sleuthing
pins several murders on the
medico —the most unimagina-
tive cop could have ferreted out

routine performance as the
smooth-talking doc. who likes

“La Nonna Sabella”
This Italian-made comedy,
with a village setting, is about
an old battleaxe of a peasant
grandmother whose tyrannical
efforts to order the lives of her
descendants bring her into
head-on collision with her
spirited relatives. As in other
provincial Italian comedies, a
gallery of attractively-odd but
recognisable characters are
presented. The plot has plenty
of action and comic situations,
and the English sub-titles have
snap and wit.

“Girls on the Loose”
Hollywood, which has given

tives, now comes to light with

other, the survivor (theoreti-
cally) to cop the lot.
You can never be sure about
women, of course, but it seems

A. Goninan & Co., Ltd.
Goninan’s are a sort of Cock o’ the
North so far as Sydney Stock
Exchange is concerned. The 12s. shares
in the company are priced at 595., and
at nearly five times their par-value were
favored far beyond the average invest-
ment even in the recent buoyant market.
There are probably not more than 10
other listed shares at such a high premium
over par.
With headquarters at Broadmeadow,
near Newcastle (N.S.W.), the co.
describes its operations, apart from its
structural activities, as “manufacturers of
rolling-stock, skips and mining and rubber
machinery, boilers, drop-forgings, iron
and brass castings, gear-cutting—spur,
helical, worm and bevel gearing.”
Formed in 1905 to take-over an estab-
lished iron-foundry and manufacturing-
and structural-engineering business, the
co. was hit badly in the depression, and
Bs. was struck-off each £1 share. After
an eight-year break, shareholders received
2\ p.c. in 1936. By 1940 the rate had
lifted to 10 p.c., and it was maintained for
the next decade. Since then nothing less
than 15 p.c. has been paid (20 p.c. for
the past five years), and capital has been
more than doubled by four separate
capitalisations of reserves.
Shareholders have thus been more than
compensated for the loss of Bs. a share
in the hungry ’thirties, and since then no
share-issues have been made for cash.
The entire expansion of the business has
been financed out of profits, retentions
and normal trade-credit —for the past two
years there has been no overdraft at
balance-day.
Goninan’s depend on B.H.P. for a good
deal of their work, and during the past
few years B.H.P. has been spending
massive sums on expansion. The coal
industry, too, has been outlaying a lot of
money under the terms of the income-tax
concessions applicable to mechanisation
and the like. In the general-engineering
business there have been reports of a
slackening in demand; and in these
circumstances Goninan’s connections
with B.H.P. and Howard Smith should
be valuable.
There has been a steadying of
Goninan’s earnings after spectacular rises
up to 1954 ; but each year since then has
shown a moderate increase:

Goninan’s own 94,992 of the 95,008
fully-paid £1 shares), gross profit of the
parent increased by £12,839 to £397,384.
Allowing £31,300 for depreciation (up
£7424) and £110,500 for taxation (down
£2500), net profit, as shown by the
accounts, was £4183 higher at £181,367.
But including the undistributed profit
of the subsidiary (£27,634), profit was
£6985 higher at £209,001, and equal to
56 p.c. on paid capital, compared with
54 p.c. in the preceding year.
The dividend was kept at 20 p.c., and

The backing for the shares in both
asset-values (visible) and earning-power is
high for this class of stock, and the
flavoring added to the generally tasty
mixture by four bonus-issues has given
the shares a strong investment following.
At around 595. the shares yield 4.1
p.c. at the present div.-rate, but show
a return of 11 p.c. on total disclosed
earning-power. As to when any more of
the excess earning-power will start to flow
to shareholders only those in the board-
room have any real idea, but it is clearly
the opinion of the sharemarket that it
won’t be too long before it does.
The Adelaide Steamship Co., Ltd.
A lthough the Adelaide Steamship Co.
set aside less for divs. last term than
it did in the preceding year, an increase
in the basic div.-rate (2 p.c. of the pre-
ceding year’s distribution was a bonus
declared out of profits on the sale of
assets) and a corresponding lift in the
published profit confirm the upward
trend in actual earnings suggested by the
1956-57 accounts.
Unfortunately, Adelaide Steam, in
common with some other old-established
concerns, seems addicted to the “here’s-
the-div.-now-guess-the-profit” game which
hinders any estimation of the potential
value on earning-power of the scrip and,
as has been the case for most of the
co’s. 83 years, earnings claimed last term
exceeded the div. by no more than a
few pounds.
In addition to operating one of the
largest privately owned fleets on the Aus-
tralian coast (two passenger- and 14
cargo-vessels with a combined tonnage
of 43,496 tons), the co., through a collec-
tion of subsidiaries, is interested in steve-
doring and towage services, small-ship
construction, marine- and general-
engineering, etc., while a well-filled
investment-portfolio includes scrip in
J. and A. Brown and Abermain-Seaham
Collieries, A.W.A., North Australian
Cement and other successful cos. These
secondary activities and investments
appear to have been mainly responsible
for the improvement in last term’s earn-
ings, and on present indications could
continue to strengthen the co’s. position.
However, as declared earnings are a well-
compounded mixture of investment-
income and capital- and trading-profits,
the relationship between shipping and
other earnings is by no means clear.
Since Adelaide Steam was recon-
structed in 1919 and £1,550,090 of
reserves capitalised (to leave paid capital
at its present total of £2,325,135), the
div.-rate has averaged a modest 6.3 p.c.,
a 2 p.c. bonus-div., from capital-profits,
added to a basic 6 p.c. rate in 1956-57
and a straightout 7 p.c. distribution last
term taking the average div.-rate for the
last 10 years to 5.8 p.c.

especially for short-haul cargo, higher
operating-costs and industrial unrest on
the waterfront have eaten into shipping
profits over the last decade, and although
the heavy cost (and doubts as to the
practicability) of fleet-replacement have
restricted the growth of privately-owned
fleets, a recent report from the Australian
Coastal Shipping Commission states that
“present forecasting suggests a surplus
of some 80,000 tons of shipping to coastal
requirements” within the next 12 months.
While the Australian National Line
itself may be more affected by this
anticipated surplus than most of the
privately-owned lines, there is little scope
for an early improvement in the overall
return from inter-State shipping
operations. Nevertheless, Adelaide Steam
appears to have adapted its activities to
meet the altered conditions of the post-
war years with a fair degree of success,
and, with recent extensions to the co’s.
engineering and allied interests, and
fatter divs. from some of the co’s. known
investments, the £1 ords. are not un-
attractively priced at 235. Id. The yield
from a 7 p.c. div. at this price would
be £6 Is. 3d. p.c., rising to £6 16s. 6d.
p.c. should the board decide on an 8 p.c.
distribution. Net tangible asset cover
(book-values) at June 30 last was 40s. 6d.
A number of the co’s. vessels were
tied-up by waterside-stoppages and strikes
during the term to June 30 last, and, with
increases in wages and other costs, there
was a slip in shipping-profits. However,
the return from investments and sub-
sidiaries more than offset the drop.
“After providing for depreciation, pro-
visions, transfers to reserves and all other
charges,” the board wrote net earnings
£23,258 higher at £162,777. Before
arriving at this figure, undisclosed capital-
profits from the sale of the passenger-
vessel Morialta and the co’s. substantial
shareholding in Australian National Air-
ways Pty. were tossed into the general
pool, from which £165,000 (up £45,000)
was sent to renewals and replacements
reserve and £68,000 (down £7000) to
insurance reserve. Treating these trans-
fers as appropriations, profit from all
sources rose by £14,755 to £395,777:

Almost 24 times the amount called for

equal to 17 p.c. on share-capital, com-
pared with 16.4, 8.3 and 6.8 p.c. over
the three years back to 1955.
An interesting development, earlier
this year, was the formation of Bulk-
ships, Ltd., in which Adelaide Steam
joined with the other inter-State ship-
owners, Huddart Parker, Howard Smith,
Melbourne Steamship, James Patrick and
Mcllwraith, McEacharn. With a view
to sharing in the iron-ore and general
bulk-carrying trades, the new co. recently
called tenders for the construction of
two 14,000-ton bulk-carriers.
Adelaide Steam has long-established
connections with the sugar trade, and the
co. expects to take delivery, within a few
months, of a new 5400-ton bulk-sugar
carrier designed for use with the bulk-
loading facilities now coming into opera-
tion at the Queensland sugar-ports. A
general-purpose cargo vessel (5150 tons)
is also under construction at the Brisbane
shipyards of Evans, Deakin & Co., while
plans are being considered for a roll-on/
roll-off vehicle-carrier to carry loaded
motor-vehicle trailers, etc., on the Spencer
Gulf services.
Cost of the two vessels now building
is estimated at over £2 million, but the
co. is unlikely to look further than the
bank for any funds needed to cover
this outlay:

Despite the sale of the Morialta and
the loss (covered by insurance) of the
aged 228-ton Wortanna, a net £413,656
was added to the cost-Zess-depreciation
value of vessels, plant, machinery, etc.,
last term, a net £64,237 going into
similarly-valued freeholds. Book-debts
rose by £402,034, and the investment in
subsidiaries by £112,880, funds provided
by retained earnings being supplemented
by proceeds from the sale of scrip in
A.N.A. (investments, other cos., dropped
by £287,184) and £433,712 from holdings
of cash. At balance-date visible reserves
were £61,527 larger than share-capital,
conservative book-values pointing to a
considerable inner-strength.
Gordon Edgell and Sons, Ltd.
A par issue of 335,000 64- p.c. registered
unsecured 20s. notes, convertible at
par to ordinary shares on June 30, 1964,
is currently helping to sustain Gordon
Edgell’s stock at a fairly high premium
on ’Change in the face of last term’s
disturbing fall in net earnings.
The notes are offered to shareholders
on the register on October 28 next, and
payment in full is required by November
30, or alternatively 10s. a note on that
date, and 10s. by June 30, 1959. Entitle-
ment is two notes for every five ordinary
stock-units held. Rights are renounce-
able, and noteholders participate equally
with stockholders in any new issues
during the currency of the notes.
Primary objects of the issue are to
finance Edgell's expansion into the baby-
food field, and to modernise existing
plant and premises.
Since sales of Edgell’s products were
only a trifle below the previous year’s
record level, it would seem that com-
petition in this class of business is
becoming more pronounced. Promo-
tional and advertising activity has had
to be stepped-up, with a consequent sharp
increase in cost-of-sales. Cheap and
abundant fresh raw vegetables were a
very strong rival during the term.
A fairly consistent profit-winner, but,
until the last three years, a rather
moderate dividend proposition, G.
Edgell has followed a policy of ploughing-
back into reserves a considerable propor-
tion of earnings to finance the organisa-
tion’s rapid post-war unfolding. Here
are the tabulated results since 1950:

sion of £81,557 (£78,638 in 1957) for

rate of 14.4 p.c. on average equity-
capital compared with 7.2 (1953), 16.5,
16.3, 22.9, 23.5 (1957) for the quin-

In its present form, the company dates
from 1930 and was the outgrowth of a
small asparagus, apple and pear growing
and canning venture begun a quarter-
century earlier at Bathurst, N.S.W., by
the late R. G. Edged. Today, the range
of both operations and products is much
more extensive. Two other agricultural
and canning stations are now operated,
at Cowra in N.S.W. and at Devonport
in Tasmania, and about 50 lines appear
in the latest Edged catalogue.

The increase recorded in
current assets, up £290,150 to
£1,715,671, was almost entirely
due to the £266,945 added to
the book-value of stocks-on-
hand, which, at £1,436,077, are
not at this stage considered
abnormally high by the board,
and possibly, too, inventories
are subject to seasonal fluctua-
tions. A £389,382 extension in
bank-borrowings underlay the
£281,346 increase in current
liabilities, £973,987, offsetting
reductions in trade creditors
and the taxation provision.
Finances look reasonably
stable, but the note-money cer-
tainly won’t be out of place.
Gordon Edgell has the aspect
of a sound, if unflamboyant,
stock; however, even cum-
rights, the scrip, at 355., seems
to have limited speculative
appeal. Each 20s. stock-unit is
well supported by 355. 7d. of

Oil Search Report
[From li. Owen]
r T' I HE report of Oil Search,
Ltd., for the year to June
30 last, is a factual review in
which no attempt is made to
gloss over the unpleasant truth
that commercial petroleum has
not been struck.
After spending about
£3,000,000, which is Oil
Search’s share of the
£29,000,000 absorbed in an
exceptionally well - organised
and efficiently-controlled pro-
gramme of exploration, the
report starkly states that the
co. will be left —at the closure
of the current operations—with
only about £lOO,OOO in liquid
funds. It even emphasises the
gruesome fact by pointing out
that this amounts to less than
2d. a share of issued capital.
As to field activities, a quota-
tion, with reference to Kuru 3
(which is the final well to be
drilled by the Australasian
Petroleum group, as at present
constituted) is >vell worth
repeating as an example of
restrained statement:
Kuru No. 3, located slightly more
than half-a-mile from the earlier
wells with the intention of avoiding
disturbed and complicated forma-
tion conditions, which brought
drilling in Kuru No. 2 to a halt at
7305 ft., has reached a depth of
7405 ft. with 9fin. casing set at
6358 ft. Drilling is continuing and
deeper formations than drilled by
Kuru No. 2 are now being
encountered.
I have previously described
Kuru No. 3 as the most interest-
ing location yet tested in
Western Papua.
Roadbuilding and road-
transport—two of the worst
bugbears to exploration in the
Papuan bush have been
almost eliminated by the use of
the far more economic heli-
copters. Credit for further sav-
ings is also rightly given to
“specialised shipping for the
difficult waterways and to
general ‘know-how’ of operat-
ing in tropical-rainfall condi-
tions.” But,
unfortunately, this great effort has
provided no positive or direct evi-
dence of the existence of commercial
oil accumulations in Papua. How-
ever, the discovery of gas in what
is thought to be commercially flow-
ing quantities in Barikewa, in con-
junction with the earlier discovery
at Kuru, leads to the opinion that
gas reserves within the concession
areas constitute a potential asset,
which may eventually be realisable,
but in present conditions with no
practical outlet.
A proposal is put forward to
float a new operating-co. by
raising £5,000,000 to press on
with the search for oil ; the
major partners (B.P. and
Vacuum Oil) have agreed in
principle that, should Oil
Search find the amount re-
quired, it will be entitled to
50 per cent, of the total assets,
including the gas already dis-
covered.
The whole project will come
under Australian control, and
the suggested arrangement
appears to be both attractive
and generous.
At the same time, it may be
pointed out, the changeover will
give an opportunity to revise
the geological technique
hitherto employed in the search
for Papuan oil. The classical
methods of the location of wells
to obtain structural and strati-
graphical information have
already produced results of
enormous future potential by
enabling all but a fraction of
the permit-areas to be dis-
carded as of little promise.
They have thus played their
part, and future well-location
should be directed more
towards tracing the routes
along which the Kuru and
Barikewa gases have travelled
to reach their present locations.
To solve this problem will
require the correlated use of
both chemistry and geology—
a partnership so far not utilised
in" this part of the world and,
even then, difficult of applica-
tion except by those who have
majored in both chemistry and
geology. But, in spite of the
difficulties, the employment of
this technique will, at worst,
reduce abortive drilling to a
minimum ; at best, it will lead
to commercial oil where other
methods have failed.
Not only in Papua, but
wherever long-distance migra-
tion of oil and/or gas has
occurred, the prospects of
success will be enhanced by its
use. In our immediate vicinity
we have in this category most
of the sedimentary basins of
the Australian mainland and,
nearby, Portuguese Timor, New
Zealand and possibly Noumea.

and the 8 p.c. div. went out as
usual.

banking services and home-

during the last year, and assets
have approached to near the
£5-million mark. The co. is a
very useful institution in
Queensland.
The Brisbane Permanent was
recently the subject of atten-
tion from Lombard Banking,
Ltd., of London, which sought
to acquire a controlling-
interest in the co. The deal did
not go through.
Brisbane Permanent offers
attractions to overseas finance

Phosphate
“Frigate Bird” writes: The
reported search for “large,
high-grade deposits of phos-
phate” in the Pacific looks
very much like a waste of
time.
Following the casual and
accidental discovery of the rich
Ocean Island block—and the
recognition of the same mineral
in a more attenuated form on
Nauru every South Sea
Island was combed for relics
of bird excreta, both by Ger-
man and British geologists and
fossickers. Anything that
offered a chance of profit—
and much that did not —was
worked long before World
War I.
Low-grade deposits, not
worth large-scale operations,
were known to exist on many
of the islands between 10° N.
and 10° S. of the Line —includ-
ing the Solomons—and even
beyond those limits, and were
worked sporadically, particu-
larly before Ocean Island
(Banaba), Nauru, Angaur and
Makatea dominated the market.
Bellona Island is no “dis-
covery,” except for the estimate
that there is 8 million tons of
the stuff there.
That it is now proposed to
work this low-grade mass
suggests how much nearer
exhaustion the better-quality
stuff is on Banaba and Nauru
than was suspected.

CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS TO SHAREHOLDERS AT THE 23rd ANNUAL MEETING
OF THE COMPANY, THURSDAY, 16th OCTOBER, 1958
It is with great pleasure that I am able to announce a very successful year with record profits and turnover
far exceeding the results for any previous year.
TURNOVER
The rapid growth in turnover during the past 12
months has resulted in an increase in outstandings
(hirers’ balances) from £4.25 millions to £7.7 millions,
which would be a phenomenal rate of growth in any
business. It was forecast in my address last year
that we would be rewarded for the trouble we had
taken to equip ourselves to handle television business
and that has proved correct. TV is giving us a large
and profitable turnover which, with a skilled staff,
we are able to handle with a minimum of trouble and
risk. It involves a lot of detailed work and control
but, handled in the way we are able to do it, TV
business is adding considerably both to our volume
and our profits and will undoubtedly continue to do
so for many years to come. The company’s long
established business in refrigerators, furniture, wash-
ing machines, radio, etc-., is being maintained and
continually developed.
PROFIT
I am happy to be able to report that the net
profit for the year (£379.271) is equal to 42.1% on
ordinary capital and 21.8% on shareholders’ funds.
This is a considerable increase over the preceding
year’s profit, both in amount and in relation to
capital. It must be remembered, however, that as a
result of our recent increase in capital (£721,849) plus
the issue of new capital which will arise in December
out of the Coupon Options, the company’s issued
ordinary capital will, by next January, have grown
to approximately double the amount at which it
stood on SOtli June last. It must not be expected
therefore that the return on ordinary capital will
continue at as high a rate as 42%. .Your directors
have no reason however to anticipate any difficulty in
maintaining 15% dividend on the increased capital,
leaving a substantial sum to be added to reserves.
SECURITY ,
It will be noted that for the year under review
the sum of £240,000 lias been added to general reserve,
bringing that reserve, together with share premium
reserve, to the substantial sum of £690,750. With
that and the balance to the credi( of hiring charges
suspense account (income yet to mature) £1,060,249,
a total of £1,750,999, shareholders can feel that their
interests are adequately protected.
MOTOR VEHICLES
I am sure that shareholders will be gratified to
know that our motor vehicle hire purchase section is
developing in a very satisfactory manner and is a
valuable adjunct to the company's business.
INTERSTATE LISTING & BRANCH REGISTERS
The company’s shares have been added to the
official listings of the Melbourne and Brisbane Stock
Exchanges. Share, Debenture and Unsecured Notes.
Registers have been opened in Melbourne and Can-
berra. This will be welcomed by the many interstate
shareholders, debenture and noteholders among the
9,000 investors in the company.
OFFICE ACCOMMODATION
Owing to the growth of business and the conse-
quent increase in office staff, it was found necessary
during the year to move the company's Secretary’,
Treasurer and Share Department to Fayworth House,
corner of Pitt and Liverpool Streets. Efforts are
now being made to obtain further space in Stafford
House (our Head office) which, if successful, will
enable us to accommodate the secretarial department
and our general office under one roof, allowing room
for further expansion.
EXECUTIVE development and training
Opportunities have been given to senior members
of the staff to obtain training by attending various
lectures and discussions conducted by management
consultants and business equipment associations.
Several new. experienced executives have been added
to the staff.
STAFF SUPERANNUATION
A staff retirement and assurance fund has been
instituted by the company which will provide sub-
stantial rewards for long and faithful service. In
addition, it is gratifying to note that 20 of the
staff have become shareholders in the company.
CANBERRA
The Branch opened at Canberra during the year
lias been very successful. It has established strong
and valual.de connections in the motor nnd house-
hold appliance fields and is adding materially to the
company’s turnover and profits,
COLLECTIONS
Collections on the company’s hire purchase
accounts continue to be satisfactory. The great
majority of our customers are paying their monthly
instalments well and regularly and the accounts
generally are in a healthy condition.
ECONOMIC VALUE OF HIRE PURCHASE
'The volume of buying on hire purchase in Aus-
tralia is now running at about £250,000,000 a year,
of which approximately £00,000,000 is attributable to
New South Wales. The whole of this money is spent
by the general public on useful, durable articles
for use in tliei'r homes (this constitutes about 33J%
of the total), and on motor vehicles, farm and factory
machinery (about 66ri%). Almost every penny of this
sum finds its way into the factories and workshops
of Australia, and the greater part of it is paid out
in wages so that it goes quickly into circulation,
lor this reason hire purchase is an extremely impor-
tant factor in maintaining and stabilising employ-
ment. Any attempt to cu'rtail it would be bound to
cause unemployment. All governments, both Federal
and State, are fully aware of this and it is therefore
very unlikely that they will do anything which would
adversely affect reputable hire purchase companies
such as ours.
The national income of Australia is no less than
£5,000,000,000. The total hire purchase outstandings
are £205,000,000 so that they represent less than 6%
cf the national income. In the U.K. it is close to
5%. In U.S.A. about 11%. Cautious people might
regard 11% as rather high but it is notable that
authorities in U.S.A. are at present doing their utmost
to encourage their people to spend more in order to
stimulate the national economy. It is noteworthy
that those countries with a well developed hire pur-
chase system enjoy the highest standards of living.
HIRE PURCHASE CHARGES
Critics of hire purchase charges overlook three
factors, (a) that rates charged by the major com-
panies are lower than those in force at the time of
the Royal Commissions in 1941, which found that
"Charges appear reasonable and there is ample com-
petition,” (b) that no true comparison is possible
between bank overdraft rates and hire purchase
charges because the circumstances are entirely
different. Hire purchase necessitates detailed and
continuous services involving considerable expense
for documentation, postages, duty stamps, etc., and
(c) that there is a great deal more competition today
than there was in 1941, and no company can exist
unless it keeps itself fully competitive in rates and
in service to its customers.
CORRESPONDENCE
It would greatly assist the company’s staff if
shareholders, debenture holders and note holders
when writing to the company would state clearly the
nature of their holding and, where possible, quote
the number of their certificate(s). If this is not
done it is difficult to avoid confusing the names with
those of our customers which may be the same or
similar.
DEBENTURES
During the year the company made an issue of
£500.000 Debentures, followed by a further issue of
£1.000.000 Debentures. Both issues were underwritten
by lan Potter and Co. and have been substantially
oversubscribed. A prospectus will shortly be filed
for a further issue of £1.000,000 to open on Friday,
si st instant. This has also been underwritten by
lan Potter and Co.
CAPITAL
In July of this year the company’s ordinary
capital was increased by £721.840 by an issue of
shares to stock holders and coupon holders in the
proportion of three for five.
On December 31 next, as mentioned earlier,
coupon holders are entitled to take up 1,348,000
ordinary shares of 5/- each. This will result in a
further increase of £337,000 in the company's ordinary
capital.
FUNDS
By January next the total funds of all kinds
employed by the company will amount to approxi-
mately £8 million. On the basis of last year’s earn-
ings our net profit would therefore be equal to
approximately 4.7 per cent, on funds employed. It
can hardly he suggested that so moderate a yield is
open to Criticism. It certainly tends to show that
the business could hardly be conducted by anyone
on any appreciably cheaper basis.
GENERAL
The thanks of the company are due to the
Managing Director, Mr. O. D. Bisset; the General
Manager, Mr. L. J. Mcßride; the company’s Secre-
tary. Mr. I. G. L. Bell, and all the company's staff
for their loyal support and hard and efficient work
during the year.


London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
HThe Old Vic season has
opened brilliantly with a
minor classic that has never
previously been performed in
England. Schiller’s “Mary
Stuart,” a 150-year-old histori-
cal-romantic melodrama, is
well chosen as the first non-
Shakspearian play for over five
years. Though no masterpiece,
it is theatre-worthy enough to
deserve a niche in the perma-
nent repertory.
That Schiller, a German,
could take excessive liberties
with English history without
danger of offending intellectuals
and fellow-historians probably
explains why the play was
popular on the Continent and
unknown here. In days when
playgoers were more scholarly
than they are now, critics would
have dismissed it as intellectual
tushery. So, in fact, it is, but
the firm construction and
splendid acting opportunities
are ample compensation,
especially to an audience that
has forgotten, or is past caring
about, historical truths.
There is certainly nothing
perfunctory about Stephen
Spender’s translation or Peter
Wood’s adaptation: the lan-
guage is simple, unaffected and
blessedly free from self-con-
scious poesy, while the treat-
ment and production smooth-
out the artifices of development
and, most commendably, trans-
form the melodrama into bitter-
sweet romance.
The essence of the theme is
the conflict between the two
Queens. Mary, the Scot, is
shown as a charming volup-
tuary, persecuted by her cousin
and finding solace in the Roman
Catholic Church. Elizabeth, the
Englishwoman, is an embit-
tered shrew, astringent, facile,
hard-hearted and painted, yet
with sufficient cunning to hold
her authority.
Schiller brings the two face-
to-face in a scene of flagrant
theatricality in which Mary, at
first submissive, loses her
temper (pathetically, too, her
case) and shouts insults at the
Queen and her parentage. Yet
the play has meat enough to
surmount the anticlimax and
proceeds, by way of high and
by no means unanimous
counsel, to the warrant, and
then, after a piece of stagey
chicanery, to the execution.
Besides the persistent “Shall
Mary die?” there are two other
conflicts: the religions and
Elizabeth’s jealousy of Mary’s
reprehensible but nonetheless
affecting power over men.
Irene Worth is an eloquent
Mary; soft, helpless and
emotion-compelled. Catherine
Lacey gives a magnificent
presence to the sour and feline
Queen (certainly not the
Elizabeth of the Tilbury ora-
tion!), but understandably fails
to impart regality. There is
poignancy in Ernest Thesiger’s
Shrewsbury and still-lipped
cruelty of purpose in Kenneth
“The magic just went out of it.”
Mackintosh's Burleigh. Mor-
timer (Ronald Lewis) and
Leicester (John Phillips) are
not so much historical charac-
ters as mechanics to grease the
plot and to link the two house-
holds together.
Synge Song
Another adaptation, this time
of a 50-year-old masterpiece, is
less successful. “The Heart’s a
Wonder” (Westminster Theatre)
is a musical version of J. M.
Synge’s “The Playboy of the
Western World” by two young
Dublin sisters, Nuala and
Mairin O’Farrell. With, no
doubt, the best of intentions, it
unwittingly maligns the reputa-
tion of a humanist, poet and
dramatist whose talents
amounted to genius and whose
dramatic power was as mighty
as Chekhov’s. Perhaps, when
the current fashion of let’s-look-
beneath-the-surface realism has
passed and the drama swings
towards the fanciful and the
poetic, we shall again acclaim
Synge’s rare quality.
His literary background is
unlikely to be repeated in these
more pressing times, when poets
have a comfortable corner at
the 8.8. C. and dramatists of
modest success can make a
good living out of film-scripts
and television. Working in
Paris as a violinist and literary
critic, he was picked up by
W. B. Yeats and sent to live
for three years in the Aran
Islands among the remotest of
Irish peasants to “express a life
that has never found expres-
sion.” Out of poverty-stricken,
and often tragic, lives he shaped
plays which, though stylised,
were essentially true. Out of
ordinary people, ordinary
speech and ordinary lives he
created joy, beauty and trans-
cendent poetry. This, too,
against furious opposition to
the satirising of Ireland.
The plays were never well
put on. Money was not
plentiful at the Abbey Theatre,
and the opinion that the Irish
are all born actors is not, in
fact, true. But the acting was
unaffected, sincere and, above
all, had conviction.
“The Heart’s a Wonder” has
nothing of this. Although the
book honestly follows the play,
it is quite devoid of poetry.
The music, which ought to have
been stylised and tailored to
the shape of the play, is an up-
and - down arrangement of
traditional Irish tunes. In fact,
the whole affair is as out-
rageously Oirish as a music-
hall tenor inviting us into the
parlor. Denis Carey's produc-
tion is, surprisingly, equally
naive.
Haunted Twilight
T. S. Eliot’s “The Elder
Statesman” (Cambridge
Theatre) is a play of mood
rather than of substance. There
are moments of evocative
loveliness, yet, apart from this
communion of thought, the
play has neither marked dis-
tinction nor the quality to
endure. It is too lightweight
and, in characterisation, too
theatrically conventional for
the theme-ethical absolution
before death.
True, Shakspeare stole his
plots and the classical com-
posers built masterworks round
commonplace phrases*. • - But
this does not mean that any
threadbare or well-tried device
can be sublimated into art
merely by its adoption.
We are among old familiars
here. A JProspero-Miranda
relationship exists between Lord
Claverton, world-weary and
ailing, and Monica, his
daughter. This is nevertheless
dramatically fresh and
genuinely creative. But the
other characters are uninspired.
Monica’s lover is a mere stencil.
The ghosts from Claverton’s
past, an Anglo-Dago whom he
unwittingly influenced into high
life and crime, and a simple-
minded revue-actress whom he
seduced, are mere caricatures.
There is also a ne’er-do-well
son and a gushing matron.
The ghosts are full-bodied
enough, and the high point of
the play springs from the reason
of their coming— to blackmail
him, not for money (both have
plenty) but for conscience’s
sake. This leads to a catharsis
of spiritual tranquillity which
leaves the heart-strings limp
and the eyes dim, but the
experience is, as it were,
insulated from the play as a
whole.
E. Martin Browne’s produc-
tion is high-minded and elo-
quently simple. Paul Rogers’s
Claverton is a gratifying
reminder that the painstaking
craft of the character-actor has
one superb exponent. His two-
hour make-up, sure muscular
control, expressive gamut
within a prescribed narrow
range and sense of character
recall the Cedric Hardwicke of
30 years ago.


other side. It’s a good
approach, this. It’s all over
and you’re roaring on your
way before anything has time
to happen.
I crawled out on a sandbank
only a short way downstream.
The bike was gone. Really
gone this time! And by the
feel of that stream gone clear
through to the Fly River. I
squelched cheerfully on
towards Christmas - dinner,
wringing-out my shirt-tail,
with a strange feeling of free-
dom. From now on a whole
skin and peace of mind.
Yeah?
The bow-and-arrow boys
had the old gut-wrencher high-
and-dry while I was still on
the soup. Howled the news
along from one to another till
one of Chuck's boys picked it
up and turned-in a transla-
tion , . t
TThe wreck didn’t start first
kick. Not till I threw
away the mud-filled muffler.
Then it roared louder than
ever.
“I guess you got a good bike
there!” Chuck said. “It’s get-
ting to have quite a reputa-
tion.”
“I hope I’m not on it when
it finally falls to bits!”
“Well, you’d only have to
figure which bit to stick with,”
Chuck said. “You keep on
guessing right when you throw
a piece away, like just now,
and you’ll finally smooth her
right down to the essential bit
of tin that makes her go . . .”
“If I could find that bit I’d
throw it away now” I said.
Chuck shook his head sadly.
“I guess maybe you’re see-
ing too much of one another,”
he suggested.
“Yes. Good thing there’s
flying for the next few days.
Chance to calm-down, relax,
untangle my nerves.”
“Fine!” Chuck nodded.
“Sure hope things work out,”
he told the bike, patting it on
the petrol-tank.
New Guinea only looks
rough from the air. A
restful difference. But after a
couple of weeks flying over the
contours I was back on the
bike using my spine for a
shock-absorber. Climbing up
to where Dan roosted on a
7000 ft. ridge. Dan pointed
down through his window.
Under some clouds you could
see a handkerchief-sized patch
of green.
“Come down in the morning
and see my coffee?”
“Track all right for a bike?”
1 asked, with a lead-heavy load
of suspicion.
“Good track! Peter rode
the bike down once . . .” -
“Once ?”
“And I’ll be riding down on
my horse.”
“All right.”
Sucking in the cold, thin,
morning air I watched Dan
ride away on his charger. A
stolid mount. Mountain-goat
and Clydesdale cross. Dan’s
outlook was that if you could
do a thing it was easy ; it you
couldn’t it was impossible.
The track clung to the side
of the mountain like a hair.
It curled sharp round the cor-
ners and dropped nearly
2000 ft. in two miles. On one
side you had good solid moun-
tain ; on the other a lot of blue
air.
Sliding at one corner, I
jammed on both brakes and
the bike just slid faster.
Jabbed a boot on the ground,
and the sole ripped off. Got
off myself and watched the
bike go over.
Natives appeared from no-
where and brought the bike
up again. The usual tobacco-
handout, and 1 had another go.
“Got here all right?” JDan
said down at the coffee. “Easy,
eh!”
Going up again the bike
would zoom for a stretch, then
peter-out, stonkered. I’d let it
breathe breeze for a while, then
boot it into action again. I
let it pull itself up some
stretches, clambering along
beside it. It seemed to like
that. We were both puffing
hard at the top. But everyone
puffs hard up at Dan’s place.
'T’he natives used to say
about one place that it was
unhealthy, unlucky. It was
unwise to go there, because any
sickness would get worse and
worse and you’d die.
One man got toothache
there, and when his throat
finished swelling his face
seemed to grow straight into
his chest. He was a mighty sad
man when I saw him. His
mates were carrying him to
Chuck’s place. Chuck worked
on him with penicillin or
sulpha, and finally killed the
infection and swelling and got
the tooth out.
The natives shook their
heads and said his survival was
just one of those things . . .
You couldn’t always be certain
of anything!
When I got toothache at the
same place there was a lot of
head-shaking and a lot of
anticipation. This was really
going to be something. It
was!
Heading for home on the
bike, my face got shaken
around so much the nerves
short-circuited and pain shot
everywhere. A double-
barrelled stream was running
about thigh-deep over both
crossings, and this time I
walked the bike through. Gave
it a few kicks on the other
side without optimism, but it
started like an Owen-gun.
After a couple more miles the
front tyre went flat.
1 started walking, and at
dusk reached the plantation of
the earth-tremor incident. My
Aussie mates there doubled
back on their own bike, fixed
mine and returned with it.
Bill had suffered the same
face-trouble some time before.
Suffered was the word, he said.
I had a feed of aspirin and
turned-in. The aspirin
bounced off.
In the morning I bounced
off on the bike towards home
and the hope of a plane
dropping-in. My face was out
like a papaw on the side that
mattered, and the papaw nearly
tore itself loose flopping about
over the rough spots. Natives
striding along the track spotted
the trouble and gestured in
sympathy. Toothache was
something they did know
about.
On over the switchback, the
bumps, the rickety bridges.
Rain swamping the lot, bike
roaring at last along the strip
and up the track to where the
grass-house crouched in the
downpour.
“Ahhh, masta Jack —you got
bigfella sick!”
“True!”
“Mi got bigfella sorry long
you! You like coffee? Kai?”
“Coffee, soup. Face bilong
mi, imi no like kai.”
“Ahhh, true!”
Tons of sympathy. Another
long night . , .
Tn the morning, clouds every-
-®- where. No chance of the
plane getting in. The papaw
was like a sagging balloon.
“Imi alsame susu, masta!”
Yes, like a big breast.
On the bike again, skidding
and sloshing on towards
Chuck’s place.
“Man, you look like some-
body smacked you!”
He had the morning sick-
parade lined - up, treating
malaria, pneumonia, axe-cuts
and the other ailments of the
Highlands.
“Can’t yank it out with all
that infection in there. Take
some sulpha along and get that
face down. These things might
put you to sleep. Can you get
to the doc. at Hagen?”
“Been hoping Bob would
turn-up with the plane—hoping
so bloody hard I bet he can.
feel it—but the weather's
crook.”
“So’s your face, I guess.
How ’bout the Old Indestruc-
tible? You still on speaking
terms? Could you kinda
jangie to Hagen on her?”
1 flopped the papaw at him.
“Yeah, I know . . . Weil, if
you’re still around when that
goes down, come on over. I’ll
have a few of my kanakas hold
you down . .
qTHE thirty miles to Hagen
used to take an hour-and-
a-half going flat-out when the
track was dry.
This trip the water flowed
right over it for one 200yds.
stretch. One bridge was down.
Otherwise it was the good old
greasy clay, gluepot gutters,
pigs racing zigzag in front,
kanaka sliprails to pull down,
thick rain-curtains resting on
the route, the lopsided face and
all-over toothache and the old
bike going like a Hollywood
horse.
Here’s the real tear-jerker—
it was my birthday. Wouldn’t
that wet your last smoke!
Shying sideways on the clay
at the last bridge, rattle, rattle,
rattle, up over the bank, across
the bleak strip to the doctor.
Somebody held my head
while he got his feet set and
took the strain—somewhere
during the struggle the tooth
let go, and the doc. and I
relaxed over a well-earned
smoke before he returned to
more serious business.
/"\n the ride home from
Hagen there was a call to
make. My company as a side-
line sold the latest in Italian
motor-scooters. Mainly on the
coast. But one of the Ameri-
cans up here was known to be
interested. Almost a sure sale.
Several times I’d pulled-up
at his place with mail, and now
I rattled across his plateau
again, propped the scrapiron
against his bootscraper and
knocked on the door.
“Why, sure!” he said. “Sure
I’ve made my mind up. I’ve
been watching this bike o’
yours go by for a long time
now. Before you took over.
Any kinda track, any kinda
weather. I figure that’s one
bike’ll never give-up. I’ve
written for a brand spankin’
new one off the same bench.
That’s one indestructible bike
you’ve got there!”

DAKUWAQA
By JAMES MEADE
I drove through Suva over
the Walu Bay bridge, and
parked opposite the main
gates of the timber-yard.
I had 10 minutes to wait, so
I lit a cigarette and began leaf-
ing through The Bulletin.
The hooter brayed, long and
strident, while I was still read-
ing the sports section. Men
came hurrying out past the
timekeeper’s office, thrusting
their cards into numbered slots,
then splitting into cloited
streams, some heading into
town, some waiting for buses,
others moving off on bicycles,
motor-bikes and in cars.
Shouldering a path diagon-
ally through the other men, Joe
made his way towards the car.
Even at that distance, and in
that crowd, you couldn’t mis-
take Joe. A part-European, he
was built the way Rocky
Marciano used to be; his
speech, movements and attitude
to things were direct and brief.
He made a bad enemy, but a
good friend; a very good
friend.
“Just a minute,” he said,
getting into the car. “Harry’s
behind me. Got a cigarette,
man? I’ve been busting for a
smoke all morning; no time
to send out for some. But I
got the arrow sharpened.”
He gripped his spear-gun
between his knees, delicately
thumbed the point of the
barbed head, then lit the
cigarette I offered. Harry
arrived and climbed hurriedly
into the back seat, still button-
ing his shirt. Another part-
European, Harry was the third
of our trio, slim, and just under
average height, like me. Harry
and I usually dived as a pair
on our spearing-trips to the
reef, while Joe went further
out and a fathom or so deeper.
We used to say that, even if
we had an aqualung, Joe
wouldn’t need it; he seemed to
have one built into his chest.
Joe wanted a new rubber for
his spear-gun, so we drove back
into town, to the store that sold
spares. Having bought and
fitted the rubber, we walked
along to the Hotel Suva, Joe
carrying the spear-gun rather
than risk leaving it in the car.
The bar was crowded, so we
bought a bottle of beer each
and sat at one of the small,
round tables that were lined-up
along the far wall.
\TTTe were drinking our second
** glasses, the beer cold and
freshly bitter, when an old
Fijian came over to us from
another table. He was shrivelled
by time and his hair was like
a great thatch of steel wool;
he staggered a little, his eyes
on the spear-gun.
When he started talking I
didn’t pay much attention, my
knowledge of Fijian being
limited to simple phrases that
I use on the job. But Joe and
Harry fired questions at him as
soon as he had finished a few
sentences. Eventually Joe
turned to me, while Harry went
to the bar for another bottle
and a glass for the old man.
“You know, Bill,” he said,
“this old feller, Viliame, he says
he knows a place out past the
main reef where there’s a funny
fish. He says it’s Dakuwaqa.
Myself, I don’t believe it
about Dakuwaqa. But he says
it’s a very strange thing. What
about we go out there this
afternoon, instead of going to
the passage? Never know,
might strike something good.”
“Sure, why not? A new
place would be really interest-
ing ; specially if it’s got a new
fish as well. Will the old bloke
take us out?”
Joe spoke to Viliame, and
the old man reeled-off a lot of
words with much shaking of
his grey head.
“Yes,” Joe said, “he’ll take
us; but he won’t dive him-
self, and he wants one pound to
show us the place.”
“Cut it out,” I said. “Sup-
pose we don’t see anything?
There goes a quid down the
drain.”
A quid was a lot to pay


for an old man’s hallucination:
beyond a painted mask or so
there was little chance of meet-
ing Dakuwaqa, ancient god ot
Fiji, who roamed the waters
from Somosomo Strait to
Kadavu and lived in a cave
beneath the sea . . . Dakuwaqa,
who enticed women to the
shores where the Pacific hissed
over the sand, women, who
were never seen again . . .
Dakuwaqa, guardian of the
reef-passages, who battled with
the moray eel, the barracuda
and the giant squid.
“I’ll tell him that we’ll give
him a pound if we see this
thing. But it’s funny, you
know; I’d really like to go
there and try our luck. But —
no fish, no bloody pound.”
“Well, that’s okay with me.
What about you, Harry?”
Harry finished pouring a
glass of beer for the old man,
then nodded.
“We might as well try where
he says. Even if there’s no
Dakuwaqa, we might strike
luck in a new place. If there’s
plenty fish, it’d be worth a
pound.”
agreed to Joe’s
’ proposition, so we finished
our beers and left the bar. I
dropped the three of them at
Joe’s house and drove home.
I had a quick lunch of sand-
wiches, telling my wife that we
wanted to get out to the reef
while the tide was falling; I
didn’t mention the Dakuwaqa
business. It seemed foolish by
then, so I thought I’d save the
story until I got back with
a string of fish- —if I got a string
of fish.
I parked the car outside Joe’s
house, walked through his
backyard and vaulted over the
coral-stone breakwater on to
the grey sand.
Joe and Harry had the long,
slim punt afloat, the old motor
we had bought between us
already in place at the stern.
Viliame was sitting amidships ;
the beer had worn off, and he
didn’t seem nearly as enthu-
siastic as he had when he
approached us in the hotel.
I got aboard and slid my
spear-gun and sheath-knife
under the thwarts, where Harry
and Joe had put theirs, together
with Joe’s 15ft. pronged spear.
Joe poled the punt through the
tired shallows, until we were
in the narrow channel that
wound like a lizard’s tail out
towards the deeper water.
The engine spluttered into
action at the third jerk of the
.cord, and we moved away from
the mangroves that fringed the
channel, the wind lifting a swell
that smacked against the bows
and flung droplets of spray
into my face. It was cool
enough to make me glad that
I had brought my old sweater,
although the sun was fierce on
our shoulders. There was rain
in the hills behind us, and
clouds were drifting across the
sky, piling up in the west like
dirty towels.
Two miles out from shore
we crossed the main passage ;
the outboard stuttered steadily
as we neared the outskirts of
the reef. The tide had fallen
so much that the propeller was
in constant danger of hitting
one of the big, green rocks that
squatted only a foot or so
beneath the surface.
I was standing in the bows,
signalling with my arms for
Joe to swing port or starboard,
when Harry tugged at my
sweater.
“Better let the old man take
over now, Bill,” he said. “He
knows the. way out to this place
from now on.”
I nodded, and changed places
with Viliame. The shallows
were smooth, so I took a
cigarette from the canvas bag
beside Harry, and lit it from
the butt he was smoking.
“What do you think about
it?” I said. “We’re way off the
usual places.”
“Yeah, man, I know it. I
don’t think even Joe’s been
diving out this piace before.
What you say, Joe? Ever been
out this far before?”
“Not diving, bro. I been out-
side the reef around here, still-
fishing, at night, but that’s all.
I don’t know this part, but
there could be plenty fish here.
See that small reef? Out there
past the edge of the main reef?
There’s a sort of channel
between, looks like. I think
Jhat’s where we’re heading for.”
I turned around; Viliame
was pointing at the small reef,
which had been bared by the
ebbing tide, and now lay
malevolently dormant, dark
and ugly rocks scattered along
its spine among the dead and
dirty shards of coral.
Joe bellowed at Viliame ; the
old man shrugged, heaved the
grapnel over the side, and took
the strain on the rope until
the hooks caught. Then,
gesturing towards the reef, he
sat down facing the shore and
lit a cigar rolled from green
Fijian tobacco.
“Weil,” Joe said. “What are
we waiting for? This old goat
won't go in. We better get some
fish, though ; otherwise I’ll
kick him from here to Suva.”
Toe peeled off the old Army
J jacket that he always wore
when he went fishing ; the sun
glinted on the gold medallion
that was strung around his
neck so that it lay in the hollow'
between the muscles of his
chest.
We stripped, tightened the
laces of our canvas shoes and
loaded the spear-guns, hauling
back on the thick rubber slings
until the wire loops caught in
the notched arrows.
As we were about to go over
the side, a cloud suddenly
blotted out the sun, and a half-
dozen fine drops of rain raised
goose-flesh on our bodies.
I hesitated; then, a little
self-consciously, unbuckled the
belt of my trunks and slid on
the heavy German sheath-knife.
I rubbed my goggles with a
cigarette butt, tightened the
band, and pulled them down
over my forehead.
As I followed the other two
into the water, Viliame turned
his head to watch us, his eroded
face empty of expression; he
spat into the water and re-lit his
cigar.
The water warm around our
thighs, we waded out to the
edge of the main reef, treading
carefully around the jagged-
edged holes in the coral. Parts
of the reef were exposed and
almost dry; in other places
there were sudden depressions,
as much as 6ft. in depth. On
the windward side, the Pacific
swept in to break in a creamy
welter of foam amongst the
ragged fissures in the coral wall.
We strung-out and fished this
wall for over an hour, collecting
plenty of scratches from the
coral, but the only fish we had
at the end of that time were
two small jack that Joe shot,
and a medium-sized cod that
I nearly lost, the arrow taking
it just under the dorsal fin.
Harry had shot at a bigger cod.
but his line had fouled, and the
arrow had fallen short of his
target. '
Eventually we arrived at the
channel dividing the two reefs,
a channel only 20ft. wide ; but
very little of that distance was
shallow enough to wade
through.
“Not far,” Joe said. “We
better try over there. This
place here is not even as good
as the passage.”
Standing together at the edge
of the channel, Harry and i
looked at one another, then at
the strange reef. Harry
dropped his eyes and poked
idly with the point of his spear
at a small crab that was
challenging his shoe.
“What’s the matter with you
two?” Joe said. “You scared,
or what? You don’t want to
believe that rubbish stuff old
Viliame talks. The old man’s
crazy.”
“It's not that, Joe,” I said.
“But I just don’t like the look
of that reef.”
“Aah, what the hell! It's
the same as any other reef.
You two lost your nerve, that’s
all. I’m going across, anyway.
If you don’t want to come,
stay here and mind the fish.”
So we followed him. We left
the three fish in a shallow pool
next to a honeycombed rock,
then we waded out into the
channel.
There was a strong current
running; we began swimming,
the spear-guns making it more
difficult, and were carried
several yards down, from our
intended landing-point.
The reef was shaped like an
elongated diamond, about 60ft.
long and 40ft. wide. The last
big earthquake must have partly
detached it from the main coral

TANK TOWN
Tank Town, they called it. Once a day the train
Roared through, and there was nothing much to see
But a few shabby shop-fronts where the main
Street struggled against dust and apathy.
Windows were mostly dark at nine-o’clock ;
The signal tower beside the tracks showed green ;
The train’s throaty hooting seemed to mock
Those huddled houses racing by unseen.
Still east and west the streamlined sleepers rolled
Across the brown plains; in the lounge-car’s bright
Complacency the drinks came tall and cold, *
Cattle-paddocks and windmill fading out of sight
As wheels ticked off the super-extra fare.

WOOL FUTURES AND “CARTELS”
(From H. Gerhard Ammermann,
Melbourne]
HPhe continuous and almost
disastrous fall in the wool-
market the world is experienc-
ing now has brought forward
various recommendations re-
garding action which should be
taken-to improve wool prices.
Recommendations of this kind
are nothing new and have
frequently been heard when-
ever wool prices slumped
abnormally ; they are generally
well meant, sometimes con-
structive, and sometimes
destructive and misleading.
In fact, in The Bulletin of
October 8 an article “Wool
Futures” brought forward the
theory that a “wool cartel” is
mainly responsible for the con-
tinuous fall of prices. The
writer, P. R. Rogers, does not
seem to understand fully the
set-up and working of the wool
trade as such, and, before
accusing some imaginary
“cartel,” it may seem practical
to explain in a few words how
our Australian wool is traded.
First of all, we have to
realise the vital factor that wool
is a world commodity. About
92 p.c. of the Australian clip
depends on overseas consump-
tion, and this represents about
27 p.c. of the world production.
Therefore we have to keep in
mind that the buying public and
manufacturers all over the
world are not at all concerned
either with our production-
costs or our standard of living
and we definitely cannot compel
people in other countries to use
our wool or to make them pay
more for it.
Is There Overproduction?
The price of wool depends
largely on the law of supply
and demand. Last year’s pro-
duction, for example, was
barely absorbed by the woollen
industry, and then only because
wool was available at a lower
price than the stocks already
held had cost. This points to
a fact, which Australia is
reluctant to realise, and that is
that there is an overproduction
of wool. Latest figures on
stocks held in England, France,
Belgium, Japan, etc., bear this
out. Consequently, with pro-
duction exceeding demand, the
prices receded.
In a way, demand for wool
has fallen as a result of the
progress of our way of living.
In colder countries homes and
public buildings are generally
centrally heated, public trans A
port and cars all have heating-
equipment, and people need not
dress warmly. They buy lighter
materials (which sometimes are
brilliantly advertised), such as
cotton and rayon, or they say,
as regards clothes, “They’ll do
for another year!” and buy a
car or a TV-set instead. Multi-
plied by the millions of people,
this becomes a noticeable factor
in the demand for woollen
goods.
In this fact lies for Australia
an important recommendation
to help the wool industry: The
Australian per capita consump-
tion of man-made fibres is
increasing rapidly. To lead
people back to the use of better
woollen materials it is not
enough merely to advertise
them. Since practically all
wool-substitute fibres are
imported it is surprising that
the Government did not years
ago introduce a protective tariff
on all synthetic materials com-
peting with wool and thus help
Australia’s own product. The
wool industry should take
immediate steps in this regard.
Is There a Wool Cartel?
Regarding the “wool cartel”
the following can be said: In
Australia some 150 woolbuying
firms are operating. Most of
them are branch-offices of large
and world-wide organisations,
and their head-offices are in
overseas countries, such as
England, France, Japan, etc.
These firms buy either as
importers and manufacturers
for their own requirements or
as agents for the woollen-mills
of the world. Their principals
transmit buying-orders to these
buyers at the auction-centres
as they receive orders them-
selves, or as they see fit to buy
according to the market posi-
tion. The basis of their opera-
tions depends largely on the
demand for woollen goods and
their availability from the pro-
ducing countries.
It is a completely wrong con-
ception to think that the buying-
firms can push the market up
or down to any great extent. As
the business is extremely com-
petitive it is ludicrous even to
suggest that some firms should
combine themselves in a cartel
with the object of lowering
prices. Since their profits
derive from a per centum basis
of their turnover, this would
mean cutting their own throats.
In fact, a number of woollen-
mills in England, France,
Germany and Sweden have
closed-down recently, and some
large wool-trading firms are
experiencing, right now,
extremely difficult times.
Wool Futures
The actual working and
history of the wool-futures has
been well described by Mr.
Rogers in his article. But as
all his studies evolve from the
conception that wool is under-
produced he arrives at false
conclusions. *
The wool - futures were
intended to be, and are mainly,
used as a kind of insurance. To
a limited extent they are also
used by some speculators, but
this would hardly have any
bearing on the market
position ....
If we add-up the total turn-
over of the English and Con-
tinental futures-markets we
arrive at a figure representing
only a fraction of the world
wool-production, and it is false
to conclude that any operations
on the futures could cause an
overall drop of more than £3OO
million (based on Mr. Rogers’s
theory).
A Floor-price Recom-
mendable?
To reintroduce a floor-price
seems at the present low level
of prices a good proposition to
the grower. But he can’t have
his cake and eat it, too, and
if prices went up he would be
the first to advocate the open-
market auction system. This
present system has surely
proved that, seen over a longer
period, it ensures the grower
the best possible return for his
clip.
* * *
[From G. D’A. Chislett, secretary
of the Australian Woolgrowers’
Council]
It is high time Mr. Rogers
(B. 8 /10 / ’5B) produced some
facts to support his allegations.
He attributes a statement to
Mr. Weatherly, “free auction
system with no reserve price,”
which Mr. Weatherly did not
make; he asserts that more
than half the Australian clip
is sold by “forward selling,”
i.e., more than two-million
bales. He does not say how he
comes by this intelligence. He
claims wool is being sold
“below cost of production as
established by the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics.” The
B.A.E. has not established such
a fact, and even inserting a
comma after “production,”
none of the information pub-
lished by the B.A.E. supports
such an assertion.
Mr. Rogers refers to a £l5O
million “drop in wool prices
since August, 1957” (presum-
ably he means “income from
wool”) and claims that £lOO
million “has been due solely to
the ‘bear’ operations of the
cartel.” Once again he fails to
tell us how he comes by this
amazing piece of intelligence!
In 1956-57 the Australian
wool-clip was 1440-million lb.
weight, which realised £478
million, in 1957-58 the clip was
reduced to 1286-million lb.,
which realised £335 million.
The fall in wool sold was thus
154-million lb. weight and the
fall in total value £143 million.
Taking the average price for
1956-57 and applying it to the
154-million lb., we get a drop
in value from the fall in pro-
duction of £5l million. If we
subtract this and Mr. Rogers’s
allowance of £5O million for
the drop due to world trading
activity and competition from
synthetics from our £143
million, we are left with £42
million for Mr. Rogers to
attribute to his “cartel,” not
£lOO million as he states.
Mr. Rogers says, “Wool is
underproduced.” As there is
no absolute demand for wool,
such an assertion is meaning-
less. In relation to the price
of wool, it is the quantity mov-
ing into consumption which is
relevant.
Consumption of raw wool
by the 10 main consuming
countries is officially estimated
as follows:
Million
lb.
clean
1958. weight,
April-June 404.0
January-March .. .. 427.5
1957.
October-December .. 438.4
July-September .. .. 439.1
April-June 492.7
January-March .. .. 504.1
Wool consumption in the
first half of 1958 was 17 p.c.
below the same period of last
year, and 12 p.c. below 1956
for the same period, in the
main consuming countries.
On September 17 the
Minister for Primary Industry,
in answer to a question in the
House based on allegations
similar to those made by Mr,
Rogers, said, “For at least four
months some of the best
officers in my department have
been making an investigation
as to whether a cartel was
operating at the Australian
wool sales. Not one of those
sources has given me any veri-
fiable evidence on which action
could proceed . . .
“From the inquiries that I
have made, I cannot find
reliable evidence —indeed, I
cannot find any sort of evi-
dence —from which I could
conclude that a cartel is per-
manently operating in Aus-
tralia and is such that action
could be taken by the State
Governments.”


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sir Blink's Cup
The spell of bad luck that
dogged Sir Blink on his Sydney
trip ended at Caulfield last
Saturday, when the colt took
advantage of a perfect run
throughout the race to win the
Cauifield Cup in runaway style.
Although, as is usual, with
him. Sir Blink took time to
settle down, at no stage did he
drop to the rear of the field,
and even at the half-mile, where
he was travelling comfortably
about sixth, it was obvious that
he would go close to winning.
Young Alan Yeomans —as
good an apprentice as Victoria
has had in the last decade
rode a just about perfect race
on the colt.
Two lengths behind Sir Blink
was consistent placegetter in
important races Pandie Sun,
inches behind him outsider
Humber Hawk. The winner
was possibly the best-backed
horse in the race, shortening
from twelves to sixes ; Pandie
Sun was 14/1 ; Humber Hawk
40/1.
Skyline tried to repeat his
all-the-way win of the A.J.C.
Derby, but the Caulfield Cup
field is invariably a hard one to
outpace; Skyline was niggled
at for the lead until the straight-
entrance, where he dropped
back, beaten.
* • • •
Sir Blink is owned by Mrs.
W. M. Kellet in partnership
with her brother, C. R. Finch.
The colt’s success was a double
pleasure for Mrs. Kellet —she
selected him herself on a trip
to New Zealand, where she paid
475gns. for him at the yearling-
sales. He is by Blue Coral from
Inky, and on his dam's side is
closely related to Rising Fast.
• • • •
Sir Blink has been made a
warm favorite for the Mel-
bourne Cup, a race that has not
been won by a three-year-old
since Skipton scored in 1941.
Sir Blink is a small, lightly-
framed colt, and the 71b.
penalty for his win may worry
him over two miles.
:• • • •
Prior to Tulloch’s win last
year, only five three-year-olds
had won the Caulfield Cup;
but Sir Blink’s success —almost
as easy a win as Tulloch scored
last year—will probably set the
pattern for future years.
Owners of good colts will be
anxious to tackle the rich mile-
and-a-half.
Trainer of Sir Blink, Jack
Godby, is one of the youngest
men in the game. It is not sur-
prising that he is steeped in
horse-lore. His father, Frank,
was a leading Melbourne
trainer for many years, and his
uncle, Cecil, prepared three
Caulfield Cup winners.
Shock of the day’s racing at
Caulfield was the defeat at long
odds-on of Wiggle in the One
Thousand Guineas. She was
beaten in effortless fashion by
the Paramount filly But Beauti-
ful. There was no excuse for
Wiggle. From No. 1 box she
jumped out in front and
opened-up a break of a couple
of lengths before the field had
travelled a hundred yards. She
stayed in command until the
straight-entrance, where But
Beautiful raced up to join her,
and then in the run home But
Beautiful drew away to win by
any number of lengths.
• • • •
Obviously, the winner is very
good. On a track that was not
at its fastest she ran the mile in
1.37.9/10, to equal the race-
record. The Thousand Guineas
(which on Saturday was
actually worth 4000gns.) is a
fairly new race, dating only to
1946. But in its brief history
it has proved a sound guide to
the Oaks, chief fillies’ event of
the year. No fewer than five
winners of the Thousand have
gone on to win the rich
Flemington race, champions
Chicquita and True Course
among them.
A well-framed chestnut with
a golden mane and tail, But
Beautiful does not belie her
name. Owner H. G. Raymond
thinks so highly of the filly that
he may give her a chance to
beat the colts in the Victoria
Derby.
The four-year-old Targui
gelding Lord is a plain-looking
customer, but he can gallop.
He ran the nine furlongs of
the Caulfield Stakes on the
middle day of the Caulfield Cup
meeting in 1.49 f, to clip
3/20sec. from the track record
previously shared by Columnist
and Rising Fast. More than
the time, the full merit of this
—Lord’s sixth win in a row —
was that he raced at least three
horses wide throughout, lost
lengths at the turn, where he
ran very wide, and was still
able to nose his way ahead of
Prince Darius, who had the
run of the race. Lord’s stake-
earnings are now £13,225. He
was not entered for the Cups,
and, like Prince Darius, will
race only in scale events during
the spring carnival. Owner
W. R. Kemball has raced some
good horses, but none better
than Lord.
• • • •
It is likely that the stock of
the imported Orgoglio will be
in keen demand at the yearling-
sales next autumn. This new
sire—he's at the famous The
Nook Stud at Nagambie (Vic.)
—has been represented by a
couple of early two-year-old
winners in Adelaide, and at
Caulfield last Wednesday his
daughter Faithful City won
the Mona Nursery at her first
start. Faithful City is from
Why Hurry and is a half-sister
to former good miler Gold
Milla. The filly is raced by
English couple W. T. Dwyer
and his wife. They hail from
Worcester, known as the “faith-
ful city.” Orgoglio himself
was an outstanding two-year-
old, winning in that season the
Champagne Stakes, Lonsdale
Foal Stakes and the New-
market Exeter Stakes. He’s a
son of Nasrullah, perhaps the
most successful sire in the
world.
Craig William, winner of the
Gwyn Nursery at Caulfield, is
a bay colt by Sweet William
from Girella. Sweet William —
at Rawdon Hill Stud (Vic.) —
won six races in England, all
over 10 furlongs, and his one
success in Australia was over
the same journey in the
B.A.T.C. Carnival Handicap.
Craig William finished strongly
in the Gwyn, and he is sure to
get at least a middle-distance
as he matures.

Melbourne’s spring racing
carnival continues next Satur-
day at Moonee Valley, where
the feature races will be the
Moonee Valley Gold Cup and
the W. S. Cox Plate. The 13-
furlongs Cup carries £4150
pr'izemoney, plus gold cup
valued at £3OO. Even richer
is the Cox Plate (10 furlongs),
worth this year £5500.

Only three Valley Cup
winners have gone on to take

Lord Gavin won the race, and
he may repeat that success next
Saturday.

Sydney Tatt,'s
Six-year-old Aqua Boy, easy
winner of City Tattersall’s
Gold Cup at Randwick last
Saturday, won at least half-a-
dozen races earlier in his career,
but it was 11 months since he
had landed the money. Still,
he was backed to favoritism
for the City Tattersall’s race,
on the strength of a good third
to Coal at Randwick 10 days
earlier. Coal (fourth) failed
to handle extra weight. Gallant
Lee (second) and Tranquilette
(third) had every chance. Time,
2.28|, was exceptionally fast —
a record for this race, and close
to the track’s best.
Though Autumn Amber’s
narrow win in the 10-furlongs
Randwick Novice was only her
second success (the first being
in a Warwick Farm Maiden
three-year-old last March) she
was well backed, on the
strength of having finished
third to Compass in a mile
Graduation Stakes at the same
course a week earlier, coming
then from the rear of the field.
She’s a four-year-old mare by
Genetout (Fr.) from Anbeau (a
half-sister to Main Topic,

won two-year-old races at
Randwick and Rosehill in fast
time, and at three years won
the Rosehill Guineas. Since his
first season he has had a few
changes of stables ; his latest
trainer, H. T. Walsh, has the
Nilo (imp.) gelding at Rand-
wick, and he’s being raced by
Adex Higgins on lease from
owner Lionel Israel. On Satur-
day Gay Lover had his second
start for Higgins, who told
jockey G. Podmore to ride the
gelding from behind instead of
using up his former early speed.
It worked, Gay finish-
ing fast to win well in the
Randwick Highweight, bring-
ing off a betting plunge.
Royal Kingdom, best sprinter
in the field, and handicapped as
such, came with a late run to
win the Buxton Welter at Rand-
wick. He had been given 9.13,
but this was reduced 71b. when
the mount was given to the
19 - year - old apprentice R.
Turner, who rode a really
good race. Short Stop ran well
for second money, and should
soon win. The favorite, The
Blue Hawk, finished third, but
didn’t flatter supporters.
Winner of the First Mac-
dougall Stakes at Brisbane’s
Eagle , Farm last Saturday,
Royal Zeta is a two-year-old
filly by Justice Jury (imp.) from
Laconia by Emborough (imp.),
and traces back on the dam’s
side to Gozo ; her family lines
include Mooltan, an early
Metropolitan winner. Laconia
won races on Brisbane’s old
Albion Park sand - track.
Queenstar, runaway winner of
the second division, is another
of the successful Star Kingdom
(imp.) progeny. Bought at the
Sydney yearling sales last
autumn for 900gns., she is from
High Cee by Gilt Edge from
Curtail by Heroic. High Cee
is the dam of several winners,
among them Beau Caste and
Bon Caste.

At his third start following
a spell of several months
Randwick-trained Lindenfels,
a solidly built Newtown
Wonder (imp.) four-year-old,
won the Second Novice at the
Canterbury Park midweek fix-
ture. From the Marconigram
(imp.) mare Usherette, whose
dam Comical (imp.) is by
Beresford, Lindenfels is related
to several good winners, among
them Commissionaire. Third
Novice winner Seal Keeper
had to be ridden right out to
stall-off Leval, whose price had
tumbled from 66’s to 20’s. The
Leval stable .seemed unlucky
not to have collected.

Rosebery trainer Bob
Stuart’s best horse, Prince Ker-
dieil, winner of the Canterbury
Guineas and third in the A.J.C.
Derby, is now spelling at Rich-
mond. He will be away about
three months, and will then be
prepared for autumn racing.
The three-year-old could be a
Doncaster prospect next
Easter. The stable has a num-
ber of smart horses in work,
including a two - year - old
brother to Prince Kerdieil, who
is a pocket edition of his older
brother. Another, Globe
Chatter, ran a good second at
Canterbury, suggesting an early
win. Yet another, Morning
Gleam, won the Punchbowl
Stakes at that midweek fixture.

The Trots
Promising pacer Diabolo
Don scored a brilliant all-the-
way win against a top-class
field in the Harold Park Flying
last Friday night, beating High-
land Jan by two lengths, with
favorite Sibelia a nose away in
third place. A five-vear-old
(youngest horse in the race), the
winner was having only his
second start in open company
at Harold Park—an excellent
trial for the £SOOO Spring Cup
(October 31). He started from
scratch on Friday, but is handi-
capped on 12yds. in the Cup.
Highland Jan (12yds.), having
her first start since June, came
from sixth place at the bell, but
made no impress'on on the
leader. Sibelia (from 24yds.)
ran her usual honest race. First
Division and Bannalagh, two
other Cup candidates, finished
close behind the placegetters in
that order. Maestro’s Melody
broke badly at the start and
was never a possibility.
The Trotters’ Handicap pro-
duced a thrilling finish between
Care and Jenny, the former
getting the verdict by a nose.
Excell enza (from 72yds.)
finished a length and a half
further back.
In the first qualifying division
of the Spring Handicap red-hot
favorite First Kiss (7 to 4 on)
failed to gain a place. He was
slowly away and was locked in
on the fence near the tail of the
field for most of the journey.
As the field opened-up on enter-
ing the straight he made a
tremendous run, to finish a
close fourth. The race was won
by Main Power from Sandy
Highland and Brusque. Sandy
Highland started at 100 to 1
and Main Power at 40 to 1, and
paid a record Quinella of
£755 13s.

The Queensland Shield-team
to meet the strong N.S.W. side
this Friday is, on paper, strong
enough, too. All are tried and
tested Shield players, with
batsmen right down the list;

made a Shield half-century. In
the attack are pace-men Lind-
wall, Fisher and Bratchford ;
and there's a good spin two-
some, Walmsley and Freeman.
Ron Archer is in as batsman
only ; “doctor’s orders” are that
he must not bowl again. Now
24, Archer has had two tours
to England and has been
spoken of as a possible Test-
captain ; but, with a damaged
knee, his big-cricket future is
in doubt. The !2th-man —
almost a fixture in the position
—is the unlucky Muddle. Pace-
bowler and handy batsman, he
impressed with bat and ball
against N.S.W. on the S.C.G.
last season when Fisher was
injured ; but the latter is the
selectors’ first pick of the two.

one of thejr two previous fights,
both of which were for the Empire

In a non-title fight in Melbourne,
George Bracken had a very close

was one of the best fights seen in
Melbourne for some time, and a

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
AMERICA AND THE FAR EAST
TTncle Sam’s cautious adjust-
ment of his Far East
policy is variously described
in editorial comment as “get-
ting off the Quemoy hook,”
“flexibility and realism,” “a
somersault,” and “dignified re-
treat.” As the following
sampling indicates, however,
there are no simple solutions
to the long-term problem of
Formosa and the immediate
issue of the offshore islands,
and the U.S. would seem to
merit rather more. sympathy
and support in the cautious
business of trying to com-
promise between its moral
stand and “the facts of inter-
national life,” of which it is
being constantly reminded by
both its friends and enemies:
London “Time and Tide”:
“Two very doubtful proposi-
tions are involved: first, that
America can control what
Chiang Kai-shek does and
says; secondly, that America
ought to. It is quite true, of
course, that Chiang Kai-shek
is dependent on American sup-
port, but he must know that
America cannot, in any fore-
seeable circumstances, with-
draw that support. Formosa
is an essential part of Ameri-
can strategy and policy. And
how, apart from the counsel
of fear, would America justify
the unconditional abandon-
ment of Quemoy? The whole
of Western policy, all our
thoughts, words and actions
for the past 13 years, have
supposedly been based on the
belief that Communism is a
hideous tyranny which good
men should be prepared to
fight even at the risk of their
lives. Are we simply to hand
over another 50,000 human-
beings to that tyranny because
the Communists want their
territory?
“The real dilemma goes
deeper. On the one hand, the
West has a perfect moral right
to oppose the forcible advance
of Red China. We can no
more afford to retreat a little,
to call for a compromise, every
time the Communists threaten
violence than at home we can
afford to compromise every
time the trade-unions demand
more money and threaten to
strike. If a man can always
get half what he asks, he has
only to ask twice as often to
get it all.
“On the other hand, Quemoy
and Matsu, unlike Formosa,
are not an integral part of
Western defence. Even among
people less naturally inclined
to scuttle than Mr. Gaitskell
there may be some legitimate
doubts about' their suitability
as the place for making a
stand. (President Eisenhower
has vigorously expressed his
own doubts as a soldier.) They
constitute valuable forward
bases for an offensive strategy,
but nothing suggests that the
-Hartford (US.A.) “Times”
GROWN UP.
West has or is prepared to
apply such a strategy. This
looks more like another rear-
guard action, with the danger
that we might be forced again
into fighting ‘the wrong war,
in the wrong place, at the
wrong time.’
“The answer is probably
that the Communists, being
the aggressors, have the
initiative and are never likely
to invite ‘the right war, in the
right place, at the right time.’
We are the Athenians
whom Demosthenes compared
to a barbarian boxing: ‘his
hands fly to the spot where
his opponent has hit him.’
From Flungary to the China
seas, this lack of any clear
purpose or determination has
shown itself the real weakness
of the free world’s position.
We have never made up our
minds what we believe or
where we want to go. Our
enemies know exactly what
they believe and where they
mean to go.”
* * *
“N.Y. Times” editorial com-
ment: “Let us try to draw-up
a kind of balance-sheet as to
Quemoy and Matsu. In the
first place, the strategic value
of these islands, except as they
interfere with traffic going in
and out of Amoy and Foo-
chow, is not great. The second
point made in favor of retain-
ing freedom of action toward
the islands is that morale on
Formosa would be weakened
if we said we would not defend
Quemoy and Matsu. Maybe
it would. There are, however,
other ways of maintaining
morale than by trying to
defend territory that is not
needed.
“In the third place, it is
argued that American prestige
in Asia would decline if we
made another retreat. But it
is hard to believe that Com-
munism would immediately
sweep still-free areas of South-
east Asia if we told Chiang
Kai-shek that he had better
draw in his lines a little. These
arguments for retaining the
islands or for defending them
with American lives and at
the risk of a great war are too
simple. They are almost naive.
“Let us consider the argu-
ments against retaining the
islands. First, there is a danger
that an attempt to retain them
by force may produce a big
war in which, unless it be-
comes world-wide and a ques-
tion of naked survival for the
free countries, our allies in the
Pacific and in Europe would
not support us. Jn the second
place, if such a war led, as
it might, to bombing attacks
on the Chinese mainland —
even though by some miracle
the bombs actually hit only
the ‘pin-points’ at which they
were aimed —we would kill
countless numbers of innocent
persons. Would this not —
inevitably, we might say
rightly—alienate the multi-
tudinous millions of Asiatics
who are ready enough to
believe evil things of the
United States? Jt seems that
this risk is too great to be run.
“What sort of solution can
we find? It would be possible,
surely, to evacuate the Quemoy
and Matsu island groups.
Simultaneously with this
action, or preceding it, we
could give a new guarantee
to Chiang Kai-shek for the
defence of Formosa, and we
might induce our allies in the
Pacific and Western Europe to
join us in this guarantee.
“Finally—and this is cruci-
ally important—we might push
for United Nations action,
already pending, to guarantee
a cease-fire in the Formosa
Strait.”
The same: “With commend-
able if somewhat belated flexi-
bility the Eisenhower Adminis-
tration is now undertaking a
‘clarification’ amounting to a
realignment of our China
policy to bring it more in line
both with the military realities
and with overwhelming public
opinion at home and abroad.
“This, in essence, is the
meaning of the press-con-
ference statements by President
Eisenhower and Secretary
Dulles in which, given a cease-
fire in the Formosa Strait, they
now propose to do what
should have been done three
years ago. This is to reduce
or evacuate the Chinese
Nationalist forces on the off-
shore islands of Quemoy and
Matsu and to concentrate these
forces on the defence of For-
mosa itself, as the only feasible
defence-line of both Nationalist
China and the free world.
“Beyond that, given a cease-
fire, President Eisenhower
offers to negotiate in good
faith for a settlement of the
whole issue on what, accord-
ing to Secretary Dulles’s hints,
would for the present amount
to a ‘Two China’ basis, without
prejudice to the claims of
either to the whole, until the
Chinese people themselves are
able to decide their destiny.”
* * *
James Reston in “New York
Times’’: “By itself, the United
States can give Formosa no
greater commitment than it has
already given, but the rest of
the free world can. Britain,
France, Japan, Canada, Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and the
Philippines could join in a
guarantee of the territorial

Stories of the Coastal Lights No. 23
Swan Island
When a lighthouse was established on Swan Island, Bass
Strait, in 1845, it was equipped with a new type of light.
This was completely different from the lights then in general
use and was one of the earliest designs of its type produced
by British manufacturers of lighthouse apparatus.
Full details of the light are complicated, but in essence
it represented an attempt to make an apparatus which wQuld
project the light from only one lamp around the full arc of
the horizon. Previous apparatus involved the use of many
separate reflectors each with its own lamp. Twenty or more
reflectors were common and this resulted in high oil con-
sumption ; in addition, a lightkeeper had to spend much
time attending to the trimming and filling of the lamps
throughout the night.
Similar apparatus was installed in 1846 on Goose
Island, which is 29 miles from Swan Island. The main
difference between the lights was that the apparatus at Goose
Island was of “fixed” type and that at Swan Island was of
the “buils-eye” or “revolving” type.
Swan Island is about two miles from the north-eastern
corner of Tasmania. It is low and sandy, and about 11
miles, long and half a mile wide. The tower, which is of
white stone and 93 ft. high, stands half a mile from a landing
jetty. Transport of stores between the jetty and the light-
house is by bullock wagon.
The original light remained in use until 1923, when
the kerosene wick lamp was replaced with an incandescent
kerosene mantle burner, increasing the strength to 148,000
candlepower. In 1938, a modern revolving electric apparatus
was installed, raising the strength to 1,000,000 candlepower.
The light is visible for 15 miles in clear weather.
Position of the Swan Island lighthouse is latitude 40°
44' south, longitude 148° 08' east.

integrity of Formosa and the
Pescadores for, say, five years,
after which the situation could
be re-examined. There are
many ways in which this could
be dramatised to make clear
that the free world, while
divided over _ Quemoy and
Matsu* was united in the
defence of Formosa and the
Pescadores. Mr. Dulles is try-
ing to defend a noble principle
—that force should not be used
to settle international disputes
—but why does he have to nail
his pants to the mast inside the
Chinese Communist harbor of
Amoy?”
* * *
London “Daily Express’’ :
“Mr. Dulles is executing one of
the hardest manoeuvres. He is
preparing a path of dignified
retreat. In this delicate opera-
tion he can count on the praise
of those who have urged him to
take another look at the pro-
blem.”
* 4c *
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“Put the blame on Chiang—
that would appear to be the
somewhat twisted lever with
which Mr. Dulles hopes to get
his country off the Quemoy
hook. According to the Sec-
retary of State the United States
never approved of Nationalist
reinforcements to the offshore
islands. President Eisenhower,
speaking as a soldier, said he
always thought the move a mis-
take.
“The import of these two
statements is fairly obvious.
They add up to an implicit
offer to Peking to bring
American pressure to bear on
Chiang to withdraw as soon as
the mainland guns cease firing.
It is claimed that this would
not mean merely handing the
islands over to the Communists,
since the cease-fire would have
to be backed by threat of trade-
sanctions by all the peace-
loving countries should the
Communists break their word.
Who does Mr. Dulles think he
is fooling? Certainly not
Chiang. How long would the
threat of trade-sanctions deter
the Communists from claiming
their pound of real-estate?
“But —Chiang willing or un-
willing—this, does seem the
American intention. As if to
rub in the lesson, Mr. Dulles
dealt another body-blow at his
erstwhile protege. Not only,
did he admit that Chiang could
never go back to China under
his own steam, but he also
declared that even if there was
an anti-Communist revolution
on the mainland it was unlikely
that the Nationalist President
would be called upon to lead it.
It is extremely difficult to
square these statements with
earlier American policy, which
was based four-square on the
single proposition: that noth-
ing should be said or done to
weaken Nationalist morale.
Even those who have defended
American policy, but have
never thought there was any
final way out of the deadlock
except neutralisation of the
islands, will find little to respect
in the manner of Mr. Dulles’s
apparent somersault.”
* * *
New York “Herald Tribune’’
editorial comment : “In sum,
this is the American position :
No retreat under fire ; meet
force with force ; meet genuine
concessions with genuine con-
cessions.
“It is a firm position. It is
also a flexible position. We are
sure the nation will support it.”
* * *
Walter Lippmann in N.Y.
“Herald Tribune “There is
no doubt that the withdrawal
of the Nationalist troops will
mean that Chiang has been
defeated in the offshore islands,
and that all hope of his return
by invading the mainland will
have been written-off spectac-
ularly. But bad as it will be for
Chiang's prestige, and also in
some measure for our own, it
will be less bad than the other
possibilities now open to us.
The withdrawal and salvaging
of Chiang’s troops will be less
bad than a war which would
be enormously difficult to
localise and, if it involved
nuclear weapons, would have
catastrophic effects on our
whole position in -Asia. For
the people of Asia have not
forgotten that the first time that
nuclear weapons were used in
war it was by the United States
against an Asian people. It is
unthinkable that President
Eisenhower should repeat that
tragedy.”
* * *
London “Economist’’ : “For
the first time the Secretary of
State [Dulles] has admitted that
he probably could persuade
President Chiang Kai-shek to
withdraw the troops which he
had so foolishly sent to the
islands over American objec-
tions. 1 Mr. Dulles recognised
that, if force were to be
renounced, it must be by both
sides and that concessions must
be reciprocal, and he wound-
up by giving a public coup cie
grace to the Nationalists’ hopes
of returning to the mainland—
unless there is an internal revo-
lution first. This is a very
different tune from the one Mr.
Dulles was still singing when he
spoke of the defence of Quemoy
and Formosa as being perhaps
indivisible and of America’s
refusal to accept any arrange-
ment that would prejudice the
rights of ‘our trusted and loyal
ally, the Republic of China.’
“Criticism of that ally was
heard from Government lips in
Washington which have long
been sealed, and, while Mr.
Dulles was saying that he did
not even rule out a meeting
with the Chinese Communist
Prime Minister, Mr. Eisen-
hower was urging the Nation-
alists’ fire-eating new Ambas-

five years has brought it to the

tinction drawn between the
coastal islands, which ‘we are
determined to recover ... to
eliminate the direct menace to
the mainland, and Formosa,
which ‘we have every right to
liberate ... by all suitable
means at a suitable time.’
“That time, the implication
may be, is not now, but at
least the outlines of a settlement
are beginning to emerge
through the gloom.

“OH, GO ON! YOU’LL BE TELLING ME YOUR'E THE PRIME

Eisenhower’s confirmatory re-
marks, may not reveal any new
thinking. Both statesmen
implied that they had long dis-
approved of the Kuomintang
policy of building up strength
on the offshore islands
(although they cannot shrug off
responsibility as easily as they
would like).
“What is significant—what
makes the change—is that Mr.
Dulles has now proclaimed his
heresies openly, although, as
General Chiang Kai-shek very
truly said, ‘there seem to be
implications at variance with
his own utterances’ in the

London “Observer ”: “For-
mosa is a different matter. The
right solution is clearly that
advocated by Mr. Gaitskell —
to place the island in cold
storage under a United Nations
mandate for a number of years,
until a plebiscite under peace-
ful conditions can be held. That
would mean, of course, the
withdrawal of American recog-
nition of Chiang as the legal
Government of China.
“This would be a settlement
which this country [Britain]
should be willing to support
and defend.- It is absolutely
essential that, in persuading the
United States to withdraw from
impossible positions, we should
also make clear our readiness to
join her in defending physically
any frontier that is interna-
tionally recognised. It is as
important for the fate of the
world that the Communists
should know where they must
stop as that the Western Powers
should agree on where they
must stand.”
Wool Textiles
Moved by the closing-down
of the old-established British
woollen-manufacturing firm of
Mark Oldr o y d, Ltd., to
comment that “the wool-textile
industry as a whole is passing
through some of the most diffi-
cult days experienced since the
war,” “Yorkshire Post” goes on
to say that “the setback is not
merely national but world-
wide”:
“Official figures show that
world wool - consumption
declined by about 124 per cent,
between the first and second
halves of the last year, and by a
further five per cent, in the first
six months of this year. There
is a modicum of comfort in the
fact that the rate of decline has
slowed perceptibly in recent
months, but it has yet to be
reversed.
“Countries as far apart as
Japan, West Germany and the
United States show declines of
more than 20 per cent, in their
wool - consumption compared
with the best point of last year,
and in the United Kingdom,
which uses far more wool than
any other country, the decline
is of the order of 14 to 15 per
cent., compared with the near-
record levels of early 1957. So
far as comparison may be ven-
tured, this country [Britain]
appears to be weathering the
present setback rather better
than most of its competitors.
“Adequate reasons for what
has taken place are not easy to
find. Early attempts to lay
part of the responsibility on
temporary anti - inflation
measures in Britain last
year have been invalidated by
subsequent evidence of a world
trend which could not result
from domestic measures in any
one area. The view most
generally held today is that a
period of overproduction in
recent years has led to •an
inevitable phase of contracting
trade, so that swollen contract
positions and unused stocks
may be more completely
liquidated.
“Retail sales of manufac-
tured goods have not fallen as
sharply as production, and this
encourages belief that stocks
of manufactured goods are. be-
ing progressively cleared and
the way paved for better trade.
“While awaiting such wel-
come developments, it is impor-
tant to refute any suggestions
that wool textiles may be a
declining industry, and to
emphasise that it is one of the
most competitively efficient of
its kind in the world today,
exporting [from Britain] a far
larger proportion of its produc-
tion than the wool-textile
industry of any other country.
It cannot hope to remain
immune from setbacks in inter-
national trade, but it is one of
our greatest national assets and
among the half-dozen largest
exporting trades of the country.
In the expanding world
economy of the future it will
assuredly come into its own
again.”
Space Law
London “Economist” com-
ment on the United Nations
problem of constructing (by
the labors of an expert com-
mittee) “some precise frame-
work for international space
law”:
“At present the last word is
more -or - less^. Blackstone’s:
‘Land hath ... in its legal signi-
fication an indefinite extent,
upwards as well as downwards.
Cujus est solum ejus est usque
ad coelum is the maxim of the
law, upwards.’
“The 1910 International Air
Navigation Conference, when
balloons were all the rage,
defined sovereignty over the
‘usable’ atmospheric air-space.
The Chicago agreement in 1944
declared: ‘The contracting
parties recognise that every
State has complete and exclu-
sive sovereignty over the air-
space above its territory.’
“The sputniks, crossing every-
one’s space at 18,000 m.p.h.
without permission (but with-
out protest) made nonsense of
the ad coelum fiieory. It looks
as if there will have to be a divi-
sion between what might be
called territorial air and the
outer space which U.N.
authority would control.
“The limit might be put, for
all practical purposes, at the


Fatih in Me
Fuiure
\
Cambridge in summer has its blue skies and
fleecy white clouds.
It has memories for me of the First War. when
as members of the Royal Flying Corps we had
Cambridge as a base and flew our aircraft over
the Cam.
So I took a weekend from London to see what
is being done there for the foundation of Churchill
College—the first predominantly scientific and
technical college to be founded in that famous seat
of learning.
Britons have responded well to the appeal to
build this college in tribute to the great Sir Winston.
Two-and-a-half million pounds have been collected
to finance its construction.
I went out to see the proposed 36-acre site,
close to the University observatory, about a mile
from the centre of the city.
What impresses me about this project is the
thorough way in which the scholarly resources
of Cambridge are being drawn upon to carry
it through.
Sir Leslie Martin. Professor of Architecture
in the University, has been retained as consultant in
the architectural planning. An eminent committee
is at work on the educational organisation.
When the college is completed it will
accommodate six hundred graduates and about
sixty fellows. The first students —probably about
four hundred and fifty—are expected to be
admitted in 1961.
The name of Sir John Cockcroft, the
distinguished nuclear scientist, has been suggested
as the first Master.
The capturing thought about Churchill College
is that it symbolises British faith in what the future
holds for those with the wisdom to apply to it the
benefits of science and scholarship.
And that is true of all people in whom the
instinct for freedom is strong.
Just outside Cambridge I visited the American
War Cemetery —a beautiful design with a simplicity
that is in keeping with sacrifice. It proclaims the
doubly historic connection that is here in this corner
of England: The city in which Harvard University
in Massachusetts is situated is also called Cambridge.
present altitude-record for an
aircraft: some 25 miles up.
But a rocket-plane, which could
not depend on the atmosphere
for lift, might reasonably be
expected to go up several
hundred miles and even into
orbit on its lawful occasions in
the future.
“The most satisfactory line is
probably one at the utmost
limit of the atmosphere: 300
miles. Beyond that, particularly
where orbiting becomes readily
possible, control must be
enforced.
“Space is a new issue for the
United Nations, but for once it
means that the Assembly will
start with a reasonably
unsullied sheet. And stars are
not bad things to have to
steer by.”
Commonwealth
Conference
Commenting in London
“Time and Tide” on the final
9500-word report of the British
Commonwealth gathering at
Montreal, British M.P. Patrick
Maitland notes that, although
the conference was rather
played down beforehand, “a
whole series of hard political
decisions emerged and were
put-over”:
“One of the most important
about Commonwealth structure
to have been made since 1931
was neatly squeezed through the
conference, albeit, apparently,
with some slight difficulty.
This was the quiet announce-
ment that the 11 countries had
agreed to form a Common-
wealth Economic Consultative
Council to ‘co-ordinate’ all
the work of economic bodies
now exchanging information,
and any others set up on a
temporary or lasting basis in
the future.
“It is to be equipped with a
secretariat from the Common-
wealth Economic Committee,
whose functions will be
changed in the light of ‘certain’
(undisclosed) proposals that
were approved. The council
will be of Finance and
Economics Ministers at the
top level, whose meetings will
be preceded by meetings of
officials.
“After the customary lip-
service to existing methods of
consultation, the 11 Govern-
ments have gone on record that
‘Members should have a full
understanding of the thinking
underlying each others’
policies.’
“So, wrapped up to avoid
offending ancient susceptibili-
ties about the dangers of a
central Commonwealth bureau
liable to encroach on national
independence, we are at last to
get a Commonwealth Economic
Secretariat. And even if it
avoids having a secretary-
general or a director-general
it is bound to have a chairman.
“Here is the thing that Aus-
tralia and New Zealand have
struggled for over a whole
generation ; and this is what,
for more than a generation,
indeed since long before
Ottawa, Canada always
opposed. And with a flourish
of genius Lord Home whipped
out the idea that, to crown it
all, Britain would establish a
Commonwealth House in Lon-
don to accommodate the insti-
tution worthily.
“It must now be left to grow
without too much digging up of
the roots to see how they are
going: perhaps a lot of atten-
tion to it might prove embarras-
sing. But this is an important
decision, even though it earns
no more than 100 of the 9500
words.”
Various Voices
Prime Minister Macmillan :
“Britain’s own trumpet
generally remains remarkably
unblown. 1 know it’s an old
tradition, but I think this
mutism can be carried too far,
so 1 enjoy giving an occasional
toot. I am tooting now. In
the peaceful use of atomic
energy we lead the world. We
pioneered the application of the
gas-turbine engine to aircraft
propulsion. Radar was
primarily a British invention.
Since the war 13 British
scientists have won Nobel
prizes. All these, and many
other achievements, too, are
good enough, but we intend to
do better still.”
* * *
Mr. Truman: “Until such
time as there is assurance
that the Communists have
abandoned their aim of terri-
torial expansion through war-
fare we have no other choice
but to meet and thwart them
at every front where it is
necessary.”
** * ■
Viscount Hailsham (Lord
President of the Council ):
“Peace is not won by pacifism.
It is not won by selling justice
for time or a quiet life. It is
not won by panicking about
the danger of war—when things
arc dangerous is the last kind
of moment to get into a flap.
It is not won by destroying
alliances overnight. It is not
won by adopting dramatic
public attitudes—bellicose or
cringing.”

mass ; there were several wide
cracks running the length of
the diamond and occasionally
forming rough, oval basins.
I looked up at the sky ; the
sun was still hot, but I shivered,
I looked to the east, towards
vSuva ; the hills were still dark,
the city a miniature jumble of
chunky white blocks.
There was no chance of
diving off the windward side of
this reef. Whether it was
because of the sudden slope into
the Pacific depths, or because
of freak currents, the sea
pounded in, dropping tons of
water onto the outside edge,
water that boiled through the
earthquake splits and shot up
from unsuspected blowholes,
showering down chilly spray.
Even Joe seemed uneasy
now; we prowled around the
oddly-shaped boulders, look-
mg half-heartedly for pools in
which fish might have been
trapped by the receding tide.
IT was in one of these big
pools that I saw it, the first
one.
I had been following a
yellow-and-black-banded sea-
snake as it wriggled slowly
across the coral, and wondering
where it was going so purpose-
fully. It oozed into a pool
that was surrounded by three
large rocks. I leant over to
watch the snake sliding through
the water, a little frill of ripples
fanning out from its blunt
head, when I saw a sudden
“He spoils her —gives her everything ."
swirling movement under the
water.
The pool was deep and in
shadow, but I felt sure there
was a really big fish there. I
pulled my goggles over my
eyes and lay down carefully
beside the edge. I put my face
under the water and poked the
spear-gun around until it
pointed at the dim corner
where the movement had been,
It was after my fourth
breathing-spell that I saw the
hand. At first I thought it was
the tail of a big fish, and my
finger tightened on the trigger ;
but then it moved out of the
shadows and clutched the
spine of a sunken rock. It
was a hand, but a hand twice
the size of a man’s, three-
fingered and with a thumb as
long as the fingers. As the
fingers spread to grip the rock,
I saw the membranous web
between them,
In the instant before I jerked
my face out of the water I
was conscious of two great
yellow eyes, peering coldly up
at me, and the blurred shape
of an alien, conical head,
I ran. I ran without a
thought for the treacherous
coral surface, and I sprawled
flat, twice, before I got to Joe
and Harry. I stood in front
of them, shaking and unable
to do more .than stutter, until
Joe laughed ; then I snapped
out of it and told them what
I had seen,
“You mean to say the old
man’s right?” Harry said.
“You really saw Dakuwaqa?”
“I don’t know; maybe it
was. But, it’s not a shark or
a man. It’s, well, it makes me
think that the sailors who saw
mermaids weren’t craazy.”
“You mean it’s a fish-
woman?” Joe said, laughing
again. “Like you read about?
With a tail?”
“No, it’s not a woman. Or,
hell, it might be for all I know.
I only saw what I told you.
You don’t believe me, come
and see for yourselves.”
I wasn’t shaking any longer.
There were three of us, each
with a spear-gun ; or we had,
when I recovered mine.
Toe and Harry lay down and
** plunged their faces into the
water. I couldn’t do it; I got
as far as'- my* knees, but 1
couldn’t put my head into that
pool again.
• Joe lifted his head, dripping,
from the water, and Harry
moved back from the edge, his
face greenish.
“Man, it’s there all right,”
Joe said. “You see it, Harry?
This is better than any fish I
ever heard about, let alone
caught. Wish I had my big
spear here. Or some rope.”
He put his head under the
water again, the big muscles
of his right shoulder bunch-
ing as he got the spear-gun
into position against the
resistance of the water. I
wanted to tell him not to shoot,
to come away, to let us get
back to the punt, and I reached
out to slap his shoulder.
Then he sprang back, almost
in a somersault, cannoning
into me and almost knocking
me into the pool.
I saw the dark shape, almost
at the surface; a broad, webbed
foot wavered for a moment
above the water, then there
were only ripples.
“Hell, man!” Joe said. “It
tried to get me before I could
shoot. It came right at me.
All right, well see. Put your
gun dow’n here, Harry. I’ll
give it one after the other and
well see how tough it is. Did
you see it? Had a go at me,
all right.”
“Wait, Joe,” I said. “Leave
the thing alone. It’s probably
just as scared as we are. Or
it might want to, breathe, like
a seal or something.”
“Scared? Who’s scared?
The damn’ thing doesn’t scare
me. I’m going to get it if I
have, to try all day.”
“I don’t like any part of
this, Joe,” I said. “And I don’t
mind admitting it. What about
you, Harry?”
“Not me either, man. Let's
get back to the punt, for
Crissakes.”
“Look,” Joe said, “this is
the biggest fish, or what, I ever
saw. I’m not going until I
get it.”
He tried a shot from another
angle ; I saw his arm jerk as
he pulled the trigger, then he
came up for air.
“Got it,” he said. “I hit it
this time.”
He started to heave on the
nylon line, then looked at us,
bewildered, his arms going
slack. When he pulled in the
line, we saw that it had been
severed, the end slightly frayed,
the way it would be if sharp
teeth had done it. Joe was

And the strong bird upward

still standing there, thought-
fully fingering the end of the
line, when Harry made a
choking noise and pointed to
the edge of the reef.
“Look, look, there’s more of
them! They’ve come for the
other one. Joe, why didn’t
you leave it alone?”
There were two of them, one
upright, one stooped, ape-like,
sunlight bright on their water-
glistening, scaled bodies. I was
briefly aware of the small
heads set, neckless, into bulg-
ing shoulders, and the barrel-
like bodies from which tapered
slim arms and legs. They
started moving forward, but
not towards us. They were
heading across the narrow part
of the reef to the channel, the
channel that we had to swim ;
but they moved clumsily on
the coral, dropping their long
arms to creep on all fours.
“Quick ; before they cut us
off!” Harry yelled, already
running.
Y\/e raced towards the
channel. I didn’t bother
trying to wade at all ; I threw
the spear-gun away and leapt
off the coral. The dive took
me almost to the other side ;
then I clawed my way onto the
main reef, not noticing the
gashes from the sharp coral.
I heard Joe and Harry
floundering beside me as they
made the roof ; then I concen-
trated on getting to the punt
without putting my feet into
one of the many pot-holes.
I saw Viliame in the stern of
the punt, trying to start the
outboard. Then I realised that
the creatures from the deep
would follow, in the water, the
same wall of the main reef that
we had fished along.
The tide had risen, which
meant swimming out to the
punt. Viliame had the motor
going now, and the punt was
running in a circle ; he was try-
ing to raise the grapnel, but
the hooks were stuck firmly in
the floor of the sea.
I yelled at him, and hit the
sea in a racing-dive, almost
climbing out of the water by
the fourth stroke, expecting the
frantic fluttering of my feet
to be stopped by a cold hand
at any moment.
I managed to grab the
anchor-rope and haul myself
on board the erratic boat. I
jerked out my knife; the old
man crouched in the bottom
of the punt, one arm over his
face, babbling in Fijian. As I
put the motor into neutral, the
boat rocked.
I turned, the knife ready—
but it was Harry, scrambling
aboard.
“Get to the stern, quick,” I
said. “I’m going to cut the
rope and hang on. As soon
as Joe’s aboard, give her the
gun.”
While I sawed at the rope,
I watched Joe. He was swim-
ming out towards us, side-
stroke, still with Harry’s loaded
gun.
“Come on, Joe, quick!”
Harry yelled. “Leave the gun ;
drop it, man!”
I didn’t see what happened
thenj Harry told me, later.
I heard Joe bellow something ;
then I had to let go the rope,
because a three - fingered,
webbed hand came up over the
side and almost got my wrist.
I slashed down at it with the
knife ; then I grabbed Joe’s
big spear and plunged the
prongs down into the yellow-
eyed, slit-mouthed face that
rose under the bows.
The punt started forward
with a jerk that put me on my
back over the thwarts, knock-
ing the wind from my lungs.
We were a hundred yards from
our anchorage before I could
sit up again.
We didn’t turn back. Per-
haps I didn’t argue very
strongly with Harry, who sat
in the stern, hollow-eyed and
sick-faced, one hand tight on
the steering-arm. I knew I
would have to fight both him
and Viliame to make him turn
about.
“He got one of them, maybe
two, before they got him,”
Harry said, finally. “One he
shot in the belly ; and he was
using the point of the gun on
the other one. But then he
went under. And he yelled for
us to go—you must have
heard him. He knew we’d all
finish there if we waited.”
“All right,” I said. “Just
don’t talk about it. Just
shut-up.”
'T'he official report stated that
he had been taken by a
shark. People sympathised
with us; they had the idea
that the “accident” had made
us a little crazy.
But that’s how it was. We
three who came back, we know
why stories of Dakuwaqa’s
manifestations persist in Fiji,
and the knowledge is as cold
as a dead fish’s eye.
My house is on the sea-front,
only a few yards from the
beach. The tide is coming in,
whispering strange secrets to
the sands. I have locked all
the doors and windows, and
tomorrow we must find a new
place to live, a place in the
hills behind Suva, a long way
from the sea.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Expertise
Civilisation seems likely to
disappear down the vortex of
its own discoveries. Road-
safety experts give such
frightening statistics on
probable road-fatalities that
each trip in the family car
appears more hazardous than a
journey to the South Pole.
From one drop of blood
medical experts can tell how
much we have imbibed and
therefore how capable we are
of driving. How long will it
really be before a man can lose
his licence or even be jailed for
driving when “emotionally
incapable”?
Advertise today for experts
who would be prepared to
judge and you would have a
hundred applicants tomorrow,
very few of them without a
university degree.
Experts who certainly know
tell us that cigarettes cause a
pretty high percentage of the
small percentage of lung cancer
which makes up the total per-
centage of all cancer, which is
a minority percentage of mor-
tality from all causes. Heart-
experts warn of too much fat
in our diet, other experts warn
us of the dangers of not eat-
ing fats. Insurance experts tell
us that the home, and particu-
larly the bathroom, is the
place where accidents happen.
The very latest from the can-
cer front is that starchy foods,
if heated to more than 360°
“in the absence of air” will pro-
duce a highly dangerous cancer-
forming substance. Is the
centre, but not the outside, of
the roast potato now too dan-
gerous? Do we forbid the kids
the pleasure of scraping the
bottom of the baked rice-
pudding bowl?
When the experts finally get
hold of a cosmic ray, what is
the betting that they will not
recommend lead underpants to
shield us from “some of the
more dangerous effects” of rays
which have been hitting homo
sapiens right from the begin-
ning?
It is not only on the health
side that the experts instruct
us. Hollywood experts on the
female form put before men
and women a standard of per-
sonal beauty which neither can
achieve.
How many men have read
“Every time I ask my husband how much he earns
he just says, ‘NOT ENOUGH!’”
the expert advice to husbands
not to come home late to dinner
smelling of liquor and imagine
that all will be forgiven by a
great big kiss As a result they
still come home late, they still
smell of liquor, but they no
longer give the girl the great
big kiss. Anyway, the whole
business of kissing anyone has
been mucked-up by experts,
what with “denture breath,”
etc.
Our knowledge is becoming
too great for us to bear. Every
expert is inclined to see more
in the perils that he has dis-
covered than he can see in
perils discovered in other fields.
It is becoming difficult for the
layman to live intimately with
the results of highly specialised
research as expressed in statis-
tics, for statistics themselves

Reafforestation
People who think that for
every .tree cut down another
should be planted would be
amazed if they saw the timber-
stand-improvement work of
the N.S.W. Forestry Com-
mission on the North Coast.
The theory is that, on com-
pletion of the logging of an
area, it is cleared of every-
thing except selected seed-trees
and prime young growth, and
a light fire put through to
encourage the germination of
seeds. Thinning of both cop-
pice growth and seedlings are
periodically made, and in
50-100 years a stand of first-
class timber should be ready
for harvesting.
In actual practice, thousands
of young trees of commercial
species, with up to 20 years’
growth and carrying nq appa-
rent defects, are slaughtered.
Trees of any species for which
there is no current commercial
use also go.
Whether or not the scheme
will be successful will not be
known for many years, and
that fact alone should cause
the commission to hasten
slowly. Current stand-
improvement could be limited
to removal of defective trees
only (irrespective of species and
age), improved fire-security
measures, thinning as the
young growth becomes a com-
mercial proposition for pulp-
ing, poles, and the like, and
the planting of patches where
natural regrowth is deficient.

House-repairs and Tax
An article on house-renova-
tion in an English magazine
suggests: “Carefully keep all
your receipts for the materials
that you use, as the amount you
spend on maintenance if you
own your house is allowable
for income-tax relief.”
Why doesn’t our Federal
Government grant the same
concession? Fran Focken

Hasty Legislating
It would be interesting to
know how much hasty legisla-
tion has been placed on State
statutes only to recoil against
those it was designed to serve.
The following clause was
inserted into Queensland’s
Industrial Conciliation and
Arbitration Act in 1952:
Any and every employee who,
having been dismissed or stood-
down by his employer during the
month of December in any year,
shall be re-employed by that
employer at any time before the
end of the month of January in the
next succeeding year shall, if that
employee shall have been employed
by that employer for a continuous
period of two weeks or longer, be
entitled to be paid and shall be paid
by his employer... .for any one or
more of the following holidays,
namely, Christmas Day, Boxing
Day and the first day of January
occurring during the period on and
from the date of his dismissal or
standing-down to and including the
date of his re-employment as afore-
said.
Since this edict most Queens-
land employers who stand-
down casual employees before
Christmas take good care not
to re-employ them before
February 1. Who loses by this
but the wage-earner?
Careless legislation on the
matter of “equal pay for the
sexes’’ could well promote an
army of unemployed young
women in our cities —a problem

Compulsory Retirement
That Australia has almost
reached the limit of taxation for
social-service benefits points
the need for overall action to
lift the compulsory retiring-age.
At present, those remaining in
jobs are carrying the retired,
many of whom are still able to
contribute something to the
economic life of the nation.
There is another important,
aspect a continuing life of
usefulness adds to the happi-
ness of the individual. It is
becoming plain that old folk
who are still mentally and
physically active should not be
pushed aside. Independence,
security and activity are
essentials to the welfare of our
increasing numbers of aged.
That’s why the settlements for
the active aged established at
Carrum Downs (Vic.), with a
further project going on at
Lara (Vic.) by the Brotherhood
of St. Laurence, have so much
to commend them.
In my own Victorian district
at least two semi-Government
employers have given a lead in
carrying key personnel past the
65-mark, with mutual benefit.
Perhaps this could be emulated
until its popular adoption brings
about some legislation permit-
ting a more realistic interpreta-
tion of “compulsory retire-
ment.” Plain Australian

N.Z. Literary Fund
In its latest appointments to
the State Literary Fund
Advisory Committee, the N.Z.
Government has not included a
woman representative. From
personal experience as secre-
tary I know that the soundest
opinions over the years came
from the women members, who
were Ngaio Marsh, Mrs.
Mary McKenzie and Miss A.
L. Loudon.
The new committee has been
strengthened, however, by the
addition of Professor J. C.
Beaglehole, noted historical and
typographical authority, and
Mr. G. Manning, prominent
W.E.A. man. Good to see also
they have included once more
the solvent wisdom of Pro-
fessor E. M. Blaiklock, who for
some strange reason had been
dropped from the committee.
The retiring committee has
given a grant of £3OO to J. M.
Thomson to assist him in writ-
ing a biography of Alfred Hill;
£l5O to Dan Davin, due here
shortly to write another novel;
£lOO to poet Jim Baxter, now
on his way to India for studies;
and £lOO to Janet Frame as an
award for her achievement “in
respect to her novel Owls Do
Cry,” which some critics placed
as the finest piece of creative
writing to come from N.Z. —

G.P.S.
Major Raven Hart’s opinion
of Australian G.P.S. (B.
24/8/’5B) followed much the
same line as that voiced by
Malcolm Muggeridge—he con-
“Trust YOU, Ponsonby, to seed a radioactive cloud!”
sidered them poor imitations of
their English models, and out
of keeping with the Australian
social atmosphere.
The Ma j o r’s viewpoint,
which doesn’t appear to have
been founded upon personal
acquaintance with any of these
schools, is open to question.
One unfair criticism was
aimed at the practice of requir-
ing pupils to wear school'
badges on hats and caps, and
ties in the school colors. He
appeared to believe that this
custom was confined to the
G.P.S., but it is as characteristic
of the State high-schools, and
has even begun to penetrate into
the primary schools, although
in these there is no actual com-
pulsion. If anything, leading
Sydney high-schools carry this
practice to even greater lengths
than do the G.P.S.
This practice of uniform dres-
sing has much to recommend
it. The cost is no heavier than
when the parents enjoy arbi-
trary choice —indeed, with girls’
schools, it prevents “keeping up
jyith the Joneses.” It also
fosters a pride in the school,
and makes larrikinism on the
part of schoolchildren far less
likely.— Cunedda (N.S.W.).
Transport Costs
With prices of wool, minerals,
etc., continuing to slip on over-
seas markets, it is essential that
Australian transport - costs
should find the lowest practical
levels.
This applies particularly to
shipping, and the Australian
Stevedoring Industry Authority
could play a useful part by
insisting on more efficient work
at ports through greater
mechanisation and increased
manual effort. In the latter
case, the A.S.I.A. might well
obtain useful results by insist-
ing upon a reasonable retiring-
age for watersiders. In every
major port there are registered
wharfies aged between 70 and
80 years. It is probably no co-
incidence that one week’s
attendance-money—which is
the minimum pay a watersider
can receive—totals consider-
ably more than the age-pension.
—Wu Foo (Q.).
Namatjira
Fifteen years ago I met
Albert Namatjira on the
Government reserve known as
Jay Creek, 23 miles west along
the ranges from Alice Springs.
On this particular morning a
party of missionaries from
Hermannsburg, further out
along the ranges, had arrived
on their way to Alice Springs.
The party included artist Rex
Battarbee and Namatjira, one
of his pupils.
Battarbee taught Namatjira
his craft, but could not pass-on
his creative artistry. Never-
theless, Namatjira, as a master
craftsman, has taken the world
by storm. The fact that he
has a black skin enables him
to get prices in excess of 10
to 25 guineas. A' single agent
has paid him £6OOO in a year.
Not that he is overpaid:—
colorful, gleaming pieces of
emotionless interior decor
come expensive. A great
craftsman but not a great
artist, Albert Namatjira has
immortalised the Macdonnells
as his maestro Battarbee could
not. The parent artist’s con-
ventionally colored skin was
his handicap.
Without presuming to dis-
cuss the private affairs of the
big, quiet-spoken Namatjira,
some comment on him as a
public figure is possibly in
order. His private affairs are
already plastered in the press
in the usual taste. One enter-
prising writer has described
him as a white man with a
black skin. Nothing could be
further from the truth. Namat-
jira is 100 per cent, aboriginal,
with all the aboriginal's capa-
city for craftsmanship. And
he happens to be the spiritual
head of his group. So he has
to give. All aborigines do.
As the white man’s creed
stresses the acquisitive, that of
the native acts in reverse.
Namatjira is represented by the
press as a tragic figure ; he
isn’t really—he is acting true
to type and giving away all
his surplus.
It has been the granting to
Namatjira of his “freedom”
that has embarrassed him. No
man under the influence of
30,000 years of rigid custom
may be slapped suddenly in
the face with freedom and
retain his stability.
It appears that Namatjira’s
personal embarrassment has
been transmuted by ballyhoo


into an event of national im-
portance. It isn’t, really.
Something sensible will be
done about him by Native
Welfare. There is a Chief of
Welfare in the Territory with
the capacity to handle the
situation. Namatjira will prob-
ably recover his status as a
ward of the State and be pro-
tected from freedom.
But some thought should be
given now to the 20 (or more)
native craftsmen who will
follow Namatjira. Of this 20,
five are Namatjira's sons. Two
of these sons show signs of
graduating from craftsman-
ship to creative artistry. These
young artists may be regarded
as the important ones. Wise
handling will be necessary to
save them.
The whole question needs
handling with a firm and
sympathetic touch. Some sort
of “Academy of Aboriginal
Artists,” rigidly protected from
the white man, might answer.
The main thing is to protect
the oncoming colts from the
fate that has overtaken their
great preceptor. —V. C. H.

True Papuans
In B. 20 /8 / ’5B “R.R.D.”
mentions Soekarno “getting the
Melanesians of Irian to admit
to being Indonesians.”
Let’s get this matter straight.
In the island of New Guinea
the Melanesians (or Papuo-
Melanesians, if you like) live
in eastern New Guinea and are
only, geographically speaking,
Papuans by residence. The
somewhat darker, shorter-
haired and taller people living
west of Cape Possession, 80
miles west of Moresby, are
“true Papuans.” Donald
Thompson (recently) and
Woolaston (years ago) showed
that the true Papuans extend
westward ’way beyond the
141st. meridian, the eastern
boundary of Netherlands New
Guinea.
All the people living from
Madagascar to Easter Island,
excluding the Papuans, belong
to the Austronesian or Malayo-
Polynesian language family,
the widest-flung language group
in the world.
To quote anthropologist
A. R. Radcliffe-Brown: “It is
pretty safe to say that future
research will prove that the
language of the true Papuans
does not belong to the Malayo-
Polynesian group of languages
at all, but is right out on its
own.”
While we must admit that the
Papuans are more akin to the
Indonesians than they are to,
say, the Chinese or us, I can
see no reason, anthropologically
speaking, for Soekarno having
any right whatever to claim the
land of the true Papuans as
part of Indonesia. Sanasi

Paying for Housing
A pamphlet issued by the
Victorian Fabian Society states
that at least 1,200,000 male
breadwinners earn less than £2O
per week, and would therefore
be unable to afford more than
£4 per week for house-purchase
or rent. As 20 per cent, of
income is considered to be the
maximum that should be spent
on housing accommodation,
and Housing Commission rents
in Victoria already average
£4 10s. and are approaching
£5 per week, with house-
purchase terms approximating
the same figures, the prospects
for the majority of lower-paid
workers are gloomy.

Solution to Crossword No. 508


form or another, by the
society’s pamphlet boils-down
to State subsidies on housing
for the low-income group,
which means, in effect, that
higher income-groups must con-
tribute to the cost of housing
lower-income workers and their
families.
Two comments might be
offered: first, the income of
male breadwinners is not
necessarily identical with
family income in a con-
siderable proportion of families
where the male breadwinner
earns less than £2O per week,
working wives bring in another
pay - packet. Second, why
should housing be subsidised by
the State? There is a case for
subsidising housing for the
aged and infirm, for victims of
misfortune, and those unable to
provide for themselves; but
there is small justification for
wholesale State housing-aid to
those in receipt of lower-than-
average incomes. You might
just as well give State aid for
the purchase of food or cloth-
ing or other necessities to those
who cannot, or will not, earn
more than a minimum income.
Alternatives to subsidies are
the spreading of housing repay-
ments over a longer period than
is now customary, and the
relaxation of restrictive build-
ing - regulations which add
unnecessarily to costs. Last,
and by no means least, is the
restoration of conditions which,
in pre-war years, promoted the
building of houses for letting
purposes.— Ardoyne (Vic.).
Charity Appeals
There is little question that
charity appeals are far too
numerous. Most businesses,
and many individuals, are con-
stantly being asked to give
donations to charitable organi-
sations and funds —in some of
the larger offices requests are
received in almost every mail.
And as the sum that any firm or
individual can afford to hand
out each year is necessarily
limited, the decision as to how
the money should be distributed
is often difficult.
Under the “community
chest” scheme, proposed for
South Melbourne, there will be
one appeal only, run on the
“door-knock campaign” lines
which proved outstandingly
successful in Victoria’s recent
cancer-campaign appeal. It will
be supported by the local auxil-
iaries, sporting organisations,
business interests, and so
forth. Funds will be allocated
in accordance with the needs
of the charities concerned.
Apart from relieving the
ordinary citizen of the feeling
that he is always being “got at”
by someone or other, the
“community - chest” scheme
should result in a considerable
saving in time, effort and money
—charity appeals are expensive,
and some cost nearly as much
in expenses as is ultimately
received by the beneficiaries.—

Tramps

plenty of small 1000-3000-ton
tramps chartered to carry coal

Workers’ Compensation
Ever since workers’ compen-
sation legislation has contained
the phrase “arising out of and
in the course of the employ-
ment,” courts have puzzled
over its meaning—without, it
seems to the ordinary lay mind,
ever reaching any clear, con-
sistent and intelligible con-
clusion.
Take, for instance, the fol-
lowing findings, all from the
same issue of a law periodical.
A clerk, while on annual holi-
days, was injured on a journey
from his home to the pay-centre
to collect wages due before he
took his leave. It was held that
his journey was not incidental
to employment, and the injury
did not arise out of or in the
course of the employment.
An employee visited a hotel,
and was subsequently on the
way to a cafe for a meal when
injured. The court held that the
injury was received on a daily
journey between the worker’s
place of employment and his
home.
A worker, returning from a
weekend at a holiday resort,
was injured on a Monday
morning. This was held to be
an injury “arising out of and
in the course of the employ-
ment.”
A worker was drowned at an
annual staff picnic. His death
was held to have arisen out of,
etc.
If anyone can find con-
sistency in these decisions, he’s
welcome to his opinion. To my
mind, however, they suggest
that the obvious thing is to
scrub the ambiguous “arising
out of and in the course of the
employment,” and replace it
with a provision that leaves no
room for doubt. — Ardoyne
(Vic.).
“Farmers and Grizzlers”
The old saying “the farmers
and grizzlers” is only half-
right, because the farmers are
grizzlers, too. They always
have a grouch, yet after all
these years they can’t co-
operate among themselves.
Country areas are crying out
for co-ordinated effort both in
the economic and political
spheres.
On major occasions—an elec-
tion or in times of stress —
many willing hands help-out,
but enthusiasm soon wanes.
For example, in a city the size
of Orange only about nine
people attend the State Country-
party meetings—and this is a
stronghold of the party. Why
should they complain about the
way the country is being run
when they aren’t prepared to
give active support themselves?
In the economic field there
are various organisations
prominently represented as
being the voice of the grower.
Actually, these organisations
represent a small proportion of
country people, because the
countryman is generally too
apathetic to take advantage of
valuable groundwork done by
public-spirited and farseeing
men. Many districts have
hundreds belonging to these
organisations, but only a mere
handful tum-up at the meet-
ings. A farcical situation is
created where, perhaps, two
or three members plus the
executive make up the meeting
and send down resolutions to
their central council. These
resolutions are accepted as
being the voice of the com-
munity.
Today, with lower prices for
primary products and fewer
world markets for our goods, it
is essential that farmers take a
collective interest in the poli-
tical and economic problems
that affect them. Van

"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
PERTH ROYAL SHOW
By CHRIS GRIFFITH
Y\7hy not let the champion
Hereford bull and the
champion Poll Hereford bull
compete for a supreme ribbon?
Poll Hereford judge Gordon
Kirk by, of Moree (N.S.W.),
suggested this during the grand
parade at the Claremont Show-
ground, where the 1958 Perth
Royal Show drew a record
attendance of 217,000.
Warming to the topic, he
went on to suggest a supreme
beef-animal for all breeds —a
supreme bull of the Show and
also a supreme cow. A supreme
beef-bull at a Royal Show
would create immense interest
and increase healthy competi-
tion between the breeds, he
said.
Cattle
Beef-cattle entries were just
below last year’s, with 200 stock
competing.
The Poll Hereford section
showed the biggest jump for-
ward both in numbers and
quality. There were, however,

ing with an effective

be carried out without

grub mean poor-quality
meals for grazing ewes
and this, in turn, means
that lambs will lack
nutritive feed. To raise

only 44 entries. As with all
breeds, blood imported from
inter-State studs featured in
prize-lists.
P. Ladyman, of Katanning
(W.A.), dominated the section,
although appearing at his first
Perth Royal and represented

restore the trams."
by a stud only five years old.
He exhibited the champion bull
and cow, and also took ribbons
for supreme Poll Hereford
animal, reserve junior bull,
junior female and reserve
senior cow.
His champion bull, costing
2000gns., came from Victoria.
It was Mt. Fyans Bold Venture,
bred by R. G. Bryant. Top
female was Brewarrana Prim-
rose 4th, with a calf at foot.
Other ribbons went to sons and
daughters of Brewarrana Dic-
tator, imported to the West two
years ago.
Shorthorn and Poll Short-
horn judge John Keynes (South
Australia) said he was agree-
ably surprised by cattle in his
section. W.A. cattle usually
face hard conditions, he pointed
out, so they need good bone
development to carry the
required amount of flesh. He
would have liked stronger heads
and deeper colors in both
sections.
Minninnooka Pty., Ltd., of
Walkaway (W.A.), exhibited
both champions in the Short-
horn section. In the Poll Short-
horns an entry by J. A. and
Walter Nicol, of Mt. Barker
(W.A.), was picked for cham-
pion bull and also for supreme
.Poll Shorthorn animal. The
bull was Keirstone Kilowood.
E. H. Lee Steere, of Toodyay
(W.A.), won the top female
award with a heifer of his
own breeding.
N. S. and C. C. Fletcher and
Son’s Dirk Brook Jarvis won
the top Hereford bull ribbon ;
Summerlea Victoria, exhibited
by Dunkley Bros., was top
cow.
W. J. and R. C. Russell’s
Trangie Anthony 3rd was top
Aberdeen Angus bull, and
Wanderin Mary Ann, also
exhibited by these Narrogin
(W.A.) breeders, was top
female.
Brigadier G. Hurst, of Lark
Hill, Goulburn (N.S.W.), who
judged the small Red Poll
section, expressed disappoint-
ment at the lack of competition.
He picked G. Walton’s Gran-
tara Undaunted 2nd (a son of
Buln Gherin Uranium) for
champion bull. H. Renk and
Sons, of Ballidu (W.A.), ex-
hibited the champion cow.
Highlight of the dairy-cattle
section was the performance of
the relatively new breders L.
and P. Pensini and Son, of
Valencia Stud, Mundijong
(W.A.). Competing in the
Friesian section they exhibited
both senior champions and
collected an Impressive list of
other ribbons. Among these
other jvinners, the junior
champion bull, Valencia David
Comet, had been born at the
Showground on judging-day
last year. The junior champion’s
mother, shortly after giving
birth to the 1201 b. calf last year,
had staggered out to the show-
ring to take reserve senior
ribbon.
This year’s reserve champion
cow, Valencia Ruth, had been
dried-off after setting an Aus-
tralian production-record for
a junior three-year-old Friesian
cow of 18,6601 b. of milk in 300
days.
The Friesian judge, R. B.
Lamond, of Nowra (N.S.W.),
praised the preparation of the
Pensini cattle (Pensini sent his
young son Fred to Sydney for
six months’ experience last
year).
Other dairy-cattle champions
were:

Champion ewe was exhibited
by C. M. Hart and Co., of Two
Wells (S.A.), and the reserve-
champion ram was exhibited by
M. A. Slattery, of Jamestown
(S.A.). (Dawkins won the
Dorset ram championship at
Adelaide a few weeks earlier,
while the Harts this year have
exhibited the champion ewe at
Adelaide, Melbourne and now
Perth. The Perth champion in
both ram and ewe was not the

In the Border Leicesters,
the champion ram was exhibited
by H. R. Heazlewood and Sons,

The Sales
This_ year’s Merino-ram
sales came as an anticlimax
after the record-breaking 1957
sales. Last year Collinsville
Stud (S.A.) sold a ram for a
W.A. record of 4500gn5., and
Merino rams averaged £373 15s.
—3O per cent, more than had
ever been obtained before for
a Perth sale-average. In the
final analysis, however, the
sale did not look too dismal
on paper. Twenty - eight
eastern-States studs offered 127
stud Merino rams. The sale
average was £337 each,
although only 143 of the stud
rams had found buyers.
John Collins and Sons,
Collinsville, Mt. Bryan (S.A.),
again dominated the sale. They
brought a team of 23 stud rams
and sold 18 for an average of
£678 11s. Although this is well
below their average last year
of £902 155., it compares
favorably with the 1956 average
of £696 16s. and a 1955
average of £337 13s.
This year’s top Perth price
was 2600gns. for a Collinsville
ram sold to J. S. Jones and
Sons, of Ejanding (W.A.).
Poll Merino stud rams sold
well. Twenty-five averaged
£3lB Bs., compared with
£2lO 15s. for 14 last year.
W. A. buyers were not
interested in selected rams—
only 24 of 67 specially-selected
rams listed in the catalogue
could find buyers.
Among the Poll Merinos,
N.S.W.’s Poll Boonoke Stud
beat S.A.’s Poll Flairville for
top average—£36l 155., com-
pared with £317; but Poll
Flairville set a W.A. auction-
record for a Poll Merino when
they sold a ram for lOOOgns.
to L. W. Gare and Son, Mt.
Glen View, Hallett (S.A.).
Haddon Rig brought a
stronger team this year and
had a solid sale, but could not
get above 800gns.
Studs to sell rams for
lOOOgns. or more included
S.A.’s North Bungaree, East
Bungaree and The Bluff, and
N.S.W.’s Burrabogie.
Time for Silage
“Sundowner”: Spring, when
growth is at its peak and most
farmers are enjoying a slack
period, is the best time to set
about conserving silage or
grass-hay.
To get the best out of them
cut cereals and grasses when
they have come to a head and
clovers soon after they begin
to flower.
It is necessary to roll silage
regularly and .to maintain
temperature of the stack at
120° F. You can check
temperature by pushing your
arm into the stack. If it’s
uncomfortably hot more rolling
is needed, and the cut material
should be brought to the stack
sooner. If the silage is cool
the material should be left to
wilt longer before stacking,
and, of course, less rolling is
needed.
Pasture that’s mature,
especially if low in clover,
should be stacked as soon as
possible after mowing, while
clover-rich pastures should be
left to wilt in the paddock for
a day or two before stacking.
Bun-stacks are cheaper and
more convenient than silage-
pits ; but with either a well-
drained site is essential. Also,
see that the location is as close
as possible to the paddock;
silage loses much of its nutri-
ment if carted long distances.
Sprouting Potatoes
“Rip Riley”: Unless cool-
storage is available, the best
way to prevent potatoes sprout-
ing is to use I.P.P.C.
This chemical should be
dusted on the spuds at the rate
of 21b. per ton (which works
out at 2oz. a bag), before and
after storing them. The cost
varies from 9s. 4d, a pound in
small lots to 6s. 6d. in larger
packages.
Don’t treat wet potatoes ; if
they show “water-blisters”
allow a curing-period of 2 to 3
weeks before treatment. Even
if they don’t show water-
blisters, treat potatoes which
have been exposed to damp
with the same caution as if
blisters were present. Don't
store 1.P.P.C.-treated spuds in
big heaps, especially after
harvest.
The best way to apply
I.P.P.C. is to dust the potatoes
as evenly as oossible in layers
while tipping them out of the
bags.
Scavengers
“Clair”: In America the
sheep plays second-fiddle to the
beef - beast, and normally
scavenges the wasteland. In
North America many flocks
roam the deserts in winter, and
follow the snows up the moun-
tains during spring and summer.
In South America the bull is
still king; sheep graze (he
second-grade country, too cold
and dry for high-class beef-
production.
It’s similar in the British Isles
where specialised strains have
been evolved in such environ-
ments as the Romney Marsh
fenland, the Cotswold and
Cheviot Hills, and even parts of
Scotland, where the black-face
breed survives under inhospi-
table conditions.
It’s been left to Australia to
show how profitably sheep and
cattle can live together on good
country.

The Pitfmasu Technique
Statements by K. G.
Schoeffel (B. 20/ 8 / ’5B) regard-
ing methods of pasture-
improvement at Mia Mia (Vic.)
need putting into proper per-
spective. Instead of apprecia-
ting the principles of pasture-
establishment as a whole, and
its problems on different soil-
types and the developments
which have taken place in this
part of Victoria (Beaumaris),
they seem to plug one theory
—the Pittman technique—and
to attempt to discredit sound
“conventional” methods which
have been developed by
scientists with a thorough
knowledge of the fundamental

principles and problems of
land-development.
Actually, there is no such
thing as a “conventional”
method of pasture-develop-
ment ; each soil-type demands
its own particular treatment,
depending on what deficiencies
it shows. Advocates of the
Pittman technique, in their
enthusiasm, are apparently
unable to see this important
fact.
The original Pittman recipe
involved the drilling of inocu-
lated clover-seed with well-
matured lime - and - sulphur
mixture, and this is the only
lecipe which can be claimed
as Pittman’s own. But I see
that Schoeffel includes molyb-
denum in the Pittman recipe,
which, somewhat like the
weather, seems to change
frequently. It has now, as
recent publications show,
developed itself by adding to
the old recipe information
obtained by scientists who have
worked-out the problems of
pasture-development on a wide
variety of soils.
It now seems that the Pitt-
man technique can only
succeed by adding other essen-
tial elements to its original
thesis. This suggests that it has
definite limitations.
The efficacy of molybdenum
in Victoria was not established
by Pittman but by pasture-
officers of the State Depart-
ment of Agriculture. Its use
was advocated about eight
years ago by R. Newman and
others as the key to develop-
ment of land in the Central
Highlands.
The hill country round Mia
Mia, in common with much of
the undeveloped land of the
Central Highlands, is deficient
in molybdenum. Soils are all
acid, though many only
moderately so. These
moderately acid soils require
only super, and molybdenum
for the successful development
of clovers after initial cultiva-
tion.
Some of the granitic land
can be, and has been, developed
merely by using super, after
cultivation. Many first-class
pastures have been developed
round Beaumaris by these
methods. However, there are
certain strongly acid soils on
which clovers do not develop
freely because the root-nodules
fail to form. It is these
strongly acid soils which need
lime in some form drilled with
the seed for the satisfactory
establishment of clovers.
The use of the Pittman
technique of drilling the seed
with lime and super, will assist
development of the root-
nodules and overcome this
problem of poor nodulation.
Here, the value of the Pittman
recipe must be acknowledged.
But that is only part of the
story. Without molybdenum
it will not promote vigorous
clover-establishment.
Research in Victoria on the
problems of clover-establish-
ment on acid soils, as pasture-
officers of the Department of
Agriculture have stated at field-
days in this part of the State
for a number of years, shows
that poor development of the
clovers can be overcome by
drilling lime-coated seed or
amounts of lime as low as 281 b.
per acre with the seed. Using
higher amounts of lime is often
not necessary and adds to the
costs of development.
This method used to be
advocated for the development
of the hill country: After
surface-cultivation by chisel,
disk or tiller, drill the clover-
seed in the form of lime-coated
seed, or with to lcwt. of
lime, together with lcwt. of
super., plus 2oz. of molybde-
num. No more than lcwt. of
super, should be drilled with
the seed, otherwise the germina-
tion of the clover might be
adversely affected. As phos-
phate is low in these soils,
liberal amounts of super, are
needed for vigorous clover-
growth, and the application of
2cwt. of super., broadcast after
sowing, is advisable.
Schoeffel advocates the use of
heavy rates of inoculum, and
claims that the Ross brothers
have done this in addition to
drilling the seed with lime and
super. The latter part is
correct, but there seems to be
some confusion over inocula-
tion, because the Ross brothers
told me that the seed was not
inoculated, yet they obtained
successful establishment of the
clover.
From experience of clover-
sowings in these acid soils, I
think inoculation of the seed
matters little, as apparently
there are effective rhizobia
already present in the soil.
The key to the successful
development of pastures on
this hill-country is to correct the
molybdenum deficiency; to
drill the seed either with some
lime or lime-coated ; to under-
take some initial surface-
cultivation (this is often not
stressed enough) and to follow-
up the sowing with further
applications of super.
R. James.
Nematodes
“Myall”: The most remark-
able of the newly discovered
soil-fumigants for destroying
nematodes, instead of being
injected into the soil like the
old types, may be applied by
irrigation, as an emulsion, culti-
vated into the soil in granulated
form, or drilled in with ferti-
liser. Tobacco is the only
crop of any importance that
cannot be treated thus.
Nematodes are found in most
soils throughout the world.
They are minute, wormlike
parasites which attack the
young roots of a wide variety
of plants. There are several
species, but the root-knot nema-
tode (Heterodera marioni) does
the most damage. This pest
enters the tips of the roots,
and feeds on the tissues, caus-
ing the plant to become un-
healthy, and eventually to die.
In Hawaii, pre-planting fumi-
gation increased the pineapple-
crop by 15 tons to the acre,
and post - planting added
another 6 tons to that. Crop
yields in southern Queensland
have been increased by 6 tons
per acre by pre-planting fumi-
gation, and experiments will
shortly be carried out with the
newly discovered methods.
Bu£k Harvest
“Shorty”: Bulk-handling of
grain (especially wheat), and of
milk and fruit also, is now an
unqualified success, though
rice and barley still offer
problems—these, however, may
soon be solved.
Bulk-handling of milk, which
has succeeded in New Zealand,
is gaining support where tried
in Australia, and may be widely
adopted in suitable areas.
Overseas and Tasmanian
experience shows that up to
lOd. a case can be saved by
bulk-handling apples. The
cost of installing bulk-equip-
ment is not high and can be
repaid in two or three years.
In fact, one Tasmanian grower
claims that it took him only
one year to recoup a £l5OO
outlay on bulk - handling
for his 10,000-case apple-crop.
Time was not wasted in
grading, and the bins saved
about 20 per cent, of space in
the packing-shed, and were
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(9/10/’58)
Queensland coastal areas from Rockhampton south-
wards can expect moderate rains in November, though rain-
fall may be patchy elsewhere. Good general rains are likely
in most of the State during December. Rainfall may be
patchy in January, with heavy rains and widespread flood-
ing during February and March.
In N.S.W. moderate rain is probable on the coast, table-
lands, north-west slopes and plains areas during November,
but falls may be light elsewhere, with good general rains
in December. Moderate to good rains are indicated for the
same areas during January, with good general rains in
February.
The southern half of Victoria can expect reasonably
good rains during November, although patchy and varying
from light to moderate in the Mallee and northern divisions.
General rains are likely in December, with good follow-on
rains over the first quarter of 1959.
Rainfall may be poor in most of South Australia in
November, although some light rain is indicated in the
central districts and the south-east areas. Good general
rains should occur in December.
In Western Australia, November looks like being a
month of poor rainfall, apart from good rains in the North
Kimberleys. However, the Kimberleys, south-eastern dis-
tricts, Eucla and portion of the south-west agricultural
areas may expect good rains in December.

Johnson-grass
“Wilco”: Johnson-grass used
to be called “Arabian millet-
grass” and was once considered
a good pasture-grass. It’s true
that cattle have often fed off
Johnson-grass without being hit
by prussic-acid ; all the same,
it has caused more trouble than
other members of the sorghum
family, so its encouragement is
risky. 1 have, however, seen
pigs put on it to clean-up the
succulent rhizomes with no
harmful effect; but they had
had some grain first.
As for Sudan-grass (which
also has had a lot of mention
here) —it may cause trouble if
cattle get a bellyful of it
quickly. It’s dangerous when
frosted, stunted or very young.
The taller it is the safer it will
be.
If the cows are getting
molasses, as in the cane-lands,
there’s not much risk of their
being poisoned by sorghums.
Clovers in Westralia
“Buzcoe”: The C.5.1.R.0.
and the State Department of
Agriculture have done much to
develop new strains of clovers,
medic, lupins and other legumes
in Westralia, and have suc-
ceeded in improving fodder-
plants for pastures, particu-
larly for the light lands and
low-rainfall country.
An exceptionally early
variety of sub.-clover was
found four years ago at
Carnamah, between Perth and
Geraldton, where it was
growing on the property of
A. R. S. Forrester, who brought
it to the notice of the scientists.
It is at least three weeks earlier
than the early wheat-country
strain Dwalganup, and could
therefore be of the greatest
importance.
Another new variety was also
found accidentally, growing in
the railway-reserve near Moon-
yoonooka. It has been named
Geraldton, and has been
grown to the stage where an
expected five tons of seed is
likely to be available next year.
This Geraldton strain pro-
duces some seed above the
ground, and although it flowers
a bit later than Dwalganup it
seeds more rapidly and matures
earlier. At Southern Cross,
outside the recognised wheat-
belt, the Geraldton has survived
two very dry years. Sown in
1955, it seeded on a winter
rainfall of 7in.; in 1956 and
-1957 the rainfall for the winter
was only sin., and last year
there was no rain from the
end of July until the break at
the end of the following May.
The clover has not only sur-
vived but in places is showing a
dense growth.
Several medics are on trial in
different areas, and at least one
has proved outstanding—a very
early variety called Cyprus,
which should grow in any part
of the wheatbelt. A pound of
the seed was harvested in 1957,
and from this small beginning
3 acres of the medic are now
under cultivation. It’s expected
that the harvest will produce
about half-a-ton of seed, suffi-
cient to start it off com-
mercially.
Some of the'sweet-lupins are
showing great promise, and a
fair amount of seed will soon
be available.
The aim is to develop not
only early strains but also those
with better leaf-growth, more
resistance to winter cold and
better seed - setting. The
examples quoted are not the
only new varieties but the ones
showing the most immediate
promise.
Cotton
“Myall”: Australia at
present needs 90,000 bales of
cotton annually, but last
season, because of drought,
only 2800 bales, or little more
than 3 per cent, of total require-
ments, were harvested from an
area of about 9500 acres,
although enough seed to sow
double that area had been dis-
tributed by the Cotton Board.
With a favorable sowing-
season more than 36,000 acres
will probably be sown-d Own to
the crop during the next few
months. The Commonwealth
Government has announced a
guaranteed price of Is. 2d. per
lb. for seed-cotton (on rails,
growers’ sidings) for a period
of five years, so there’s no risk
of prices falling in the near
future.
Two additional experienced
officers of the Queensland
Agricultural Department have
been appointed to work with
the growers. The board sup-
plies seed free to bona-fide
farmers, and when 400 or 500
acres are grown in a concen-
trated area mechanical pickers
are supplied by the board from
its fleet of 16 machines.
A recent State survey shows
that practically all farming
areas from Cooktown in the
north to the N.S.W. border are
suitable for the cultivation of
cotton. It can be grown with
or without irrigation, but yields
from irrigated farms are always
almost twice as heavy as those
from rain-grown areas.
Cotton-growing experiments
have been carried out in many
districts in Queensland over
the past 50 years. The Upper
Burnett Valley used to produce
large quantities of high-grade
lint, but low prices gradually
forced growers to sow more
profitable crops, so the industry
was allowed to languish. To-
day the Dawson and Callide
Valleys, some distance to
the north, are producing
phenomena] crops of good
cotton on irrigated properties.
A Dawson Valley farmer
harvested 18661 b. of cotton per
acre (with irrigation) and
received a gross return of £129
per acre. Six other growers
in the same district averaged
14381 b. per acre, with a gross
return of £93 per acre. Where
irrigation is not practicable,
rain-grown cotton will produce
up to 8001 b. per acre, worth
£46 gross or £25 net per acre —
a good return compared with
many other crops.
While cotton can be a valu-
able contribution to the income
of a small. farmer, large areas
give far better returns, because
much costly machinery is
needed for efficient growing.
Where operations are done
mechanically, costs can be
kept to a minimum to give a
greater net return.
The worst pest is the corn-
ear worm (Heliothus armgeri),
which eats its way into the bolls
when they're small and devours
the developing cotton, leaving
only the empty shell. This pest
can be controlled by dusting
arsenate-of-lead on the crop at
the rate of 81b. to 151 b. per
acre. The plants should be
examined weekly for eight
weeks after the start of
“squaring.” Immediately the
number of eggs seen on the
terminals show an increase
control-measures are needed.
Spraying with 25 per cent.
D.D.T.-emulsion, at the rate of
lgal. to has proved
fairly effective.
Cotton-seed is sown in the
late spring or early summer,
as soon as frost-danger is past.
Thorough land-preparation is
essential and should be done in
late summer or early autumn,
so that soil-moisture may be
conserved. Prepare the field as
for a crop of maize or sorg-
hum, bringing it to a fine tilth.
Quantity of seed per acre
varies ; crops on irrigation may
be planted closer than on
unirrigated land, and the dist-
ance allowed between the rows
is a big factor.
Farmers on fhe N.S.W.
North Coast and in New
England might well give this
crop a trial. Officers of the
Queensland Agricultural De-
partment and the Cotton Board
are available to give growers
every assistance on problems
of sowing, pest-control and
harvesting.

worth more than £2 an acre,
without considering the value
of the humus.

exactly, the buyer being assured that
the master painted several replicas
of it. (2) Tiny spots of paint are
sometimes extracted from the paint-
ing with a hollow needle. These
are examined under the microscope
and submitted to chemical analysis.
It. is thus possible to determine
whether the paints correspond to
those used at the time of the Old
Master. Another method is by use
of X-ray or ultra-violet rays. Very
often the faker paints over an old
painting of no merit so as to get a
genuinely ancient’- basis. X-rays
show-up any picture on the canvas
over which a later picture has been
superimposed. Photo - micrographs
of the brush-strokes are also
helpful.

How, to prepare walnut-juice ?
This has long since disappeared
from most pharmacy formulas —it
is probably used these days only as
a .theatrical stain. The green nuts
should be gathered before they ripen
and split open, and the green husks
(which contain the juice) cut off
and the nuts set aside. Any kind of
press can then be applied to the
mass of husk and the juice collec-
ted. Probably an electrical food-
grinder could be used to start the
process. Boiling in water and then
straining would produce a diluted
juice, excess water being evaporated
by slow steaming.

How to treat books in which the
page-margins show, dull, rusty
patches ?
Sometimes the patches may be
removed by chemical treatment, but
it is often better to accept the con-
dition than run the risk of weaken-
ing the page. Bleaching is possible,
but is recommended only when it
will do no harm. When bleaching,
use three shallow (non-metal) trays,
one filled with potassium-perman-
ganate, the second with water, and
the third with potassium-meta-
bisulphite—each of the potassium
compounds should be diluted loz.
to 16oz. water. Put the paper
in the permanganate ' solution for
30-60 seconds, when the sheet will
turn a deep, purplish brown. Wash
off the permanganate in the clean
water, then put in the potassium
solution, whereupon the sheet will
turn white. Leave sheet in this
pari till all stains disappear, then
rinse under running water. Dry
between blotters and place in a
press to remove wrinkles. With
single sheets it may be best to cut
them out, bleach, wash and re-
mount on a stub left for the
purpose.

Recipe for making mead ?
It’s usual to use only honey which
is thin or not very suitable for sale
or table-use, many old beekeepers
making use of the comb and add-
ing a little more honey to get the
right strength. To every gallon
of water add 41b. honey. Put in
the thinly pared rind of a couple
of lemons and boil for 30min.,
skimming carefully. Strain into a
clean tub, put in a piece of toast
spread with brewers’ yeast and cover
the tub with a coarse cloth. In about
four days pour into a cask, leaving
the bunghole lightly stoppered so
that the yeast may work out. As
socn as it has ceased working bung-
down tightly and leave for six
months before bottling. Important
that air should not get at the
liquor while it is working, so the
cask must be quite full. The
longer it’s kept in the cask the
better it is.

Information on Labor Minister
Calwell’s administration of the
White Australia policy ? Why was
his administration criticised so
much ?
He was Minister for Immigration
from 1945 to 1949 and was criticised
in some quarters for his “harsh”
administration. Those whom he
deported, or tried to deport, and
whose cases became causes celebres,
included Mrs. Annie O’Keefe, an
Indonesian woman with a large
family married to an Australian;
a Filipino, Sgt. Gamboa ; Mrs.
Tony Ang, a Malayan woman; a
Siamese woman resident many years
in Australia, Meh Jerm Bugetr; and
many Chinese, including Mrs
Pauline Lee Tong and Frank Jang.
Two American negro boxers,
Alabama Kid and “Tiger” Parks,
were also deported in 1948-49. Mrs.
O’Keefe appealed against her pro-
jected deportation, and in March,
1949, the High Court upheld her

"JACKSUL,” BRISBANE
appeal by a four-to-two majority.
The Bulletin said at the time that
“few will dispute that the legal
verdict and that of common
humanity were identical.”
The Chifley Government tried to
get around this by changing the
law, and in December, 1949, the
High Court upheld the legality of
the War-time Refugees Removal
Act and the 1949 Immigration Act.
A few days later the Chifley Govern-
ment, which sponsored both these
Acts, had ceased to exist. Latham,
then C.J., said: “No person simply
by his own act can make himself a
member of the community if the
community refuses to have him.”
Calwell’s critics did not object to
the White Australia policy, but
merely to the manner in which he
was implementing it. His attitude
was that the White Australia policy
left him no option but to expel
persons of Asiatic origin. Holt's
approach, after succeeding as
Minister for Immigration (Dec.,
1949), was that each case had to be
considered on its merits. As The
Bulletin said (B. 28/12/’49), “A
generous and humane approach to
cases like that of Mrs. O'Keefe
would, by showing that our motives
are not based oh racial prejudice,
strengthen rather than weaken the
White Australia policy.” Mrs.
O’Keefe, Sgt. Gamboa, Mrs. Ang
and some others were allowed to
remain-—or to return —and settle in
Australia.

(1) and (2) There was no Aus-

War. They were known as (a)
N.S.W. Lancers, ( b ) First Austra-
lian Horse, (c) Mounted Rifles, (d)
Bushmen and (e) Commonwealth
Horse. The first category consisted
of one squadron under Captain C.
F Cox; they sailed from England,
where they had been on a military
tournament, on October 10, 1899,
arriving at Capetown on Novem-
ber 2. They were reinforced- by
drafts on the Kent, Moravian and
Australian from N.S.W., reaching
Capetown on December 1, 1899,
February 18, 1900, and March 19,
1900.
The First Australian Horse com-
prised two contingents, arriving at
Capetown on December 13, 1899,
and February 23, 1900. Strength
of this unit was not more than 140,
under the command of Captain R.
R. Thompson. Divisions (c), (d)
and (e) all left Sydney during 1900,
1901 and 1902, and each served for
■a maximum term of one year, the
late units for only short periods
before peace was proclaimed on
May 31, 1902.
(3) There was no Australian
general in supreme command; each
unit was attached to British Army
commands. The most senior Aus-
tralian officers were lieut.-colonels,
who were on staff-duties or in
command of light columns.

What is the Australian price of
copper at the present ?
The selling-price of copper from
January 2, 1958, was £330 per ton,
from May 19, 1958, £285 per ton,
and from August 18, 1958, £290
per ton. Basis for determining price
payable on copper-ores and concen-
trates received by the Electrolytic
Refining and Smelting Co. of Aus-
tralia Pty., Ltd., Port Kembla, since
August 1, 1957, has been “the price
per ton for copper to be 96 per cent,
(calculated to the nearest £) of the
Australian domestic price of refined
copper ex Port Kembla existing on
the day of receipt of the material.”
Price to the producer on the dates
quoted above have been £317, £274
and £278 per ton, excluding subsidy.
Price payable to the producer is
subject to charges imposed by the
smelter and refiner for receiving,
sampling, assaying, smelting, con-
verting and refining—these charges
vary, according to the individual
smelter.
The Commonwealth Government
subsidy on copper-production is not
yet available. A bill giving effect
to the Tariff Board’s advice on
assistance to the copper-industry
was introduced into the House of
Representatives on September 25,
1958, but the provisions have not
yet become law.
The Queensland Government
Mining Journal contains details of
the ore-buying schedules of the
main copper-smelters in Australia,
E.R.S., at Port Kembla (N.S.W.),
Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd., at Mt. Isa (Q.),
and Mt. Morgan, Ltd., at Mt.

Women's Letters
MELBOURNE
The first showing of the Norman Hart-
nell collection was in the Chandelier
Room of the Myer Emporium. Mr.
Hartnell and the management of Myer’s
donated proceeds from this parade to
the Whernside Auxiliary of the Royal
Women’s Hospital, and at the conclusion
of the parade the auxiliary’s president,
Mrs. James Campbell, thanked them for
their gesture.
Attending the showing were Lady
Brooks (smart in a navy suit and small
pastel-pink flower-hat); Mrs. R. H.
Spraggett and Mrs. John Buckland;
Mrs. Sydney Baillieu Myer (attractive in
a mauve ensemble); Lady Myer' and her
mother, Mrs. Louis Sallmann; Mrs.
Harold Holt (her choice a navy suit and
white-flower wig-hat); Lady Clarke; Mrs.
Hamilton Sleigh and Mrs. Eric Avery ;
Mrs. A. G. Silk (wearing a large white
hat veiled with black tulle and finished
with one white rose); Mrs. Colin
Norman ; Mrs. James Buchanan ; Lady
Tait; Mrs. G. R. Nicholas.
The most interesting feature of this
collection by the Queen’s dressmaker was
his trend towards the high-waisted
Empire-line (with several variations on
a built-up waistline) and the chemise-
dress. Often he cleverly combined the
two. The chemise-dress is, of course,
a loose-hanging style, but often Hartnell
introduced a band of embroidery or
bead-trimming high under the bust-line,
so giving to an otherwise straight-
hanging frock the Empire-look. The
main colors he used were gold and burnt-
orange tonings, many blendings of the
citrus-greens, and the ever-popular black-
and-white.
Pure mohair in coats was another
fashion-pointer, and a highlight of the
parade was an after-five full-skirted frock
in tangy burnt-orange mohair with a
matching stole, heavily embroidered.
This he called “Christmas Eve.” Over
the high Empire-line sheath-frock Hart-
nell uses a jacket, cut very short. All
his day-skirts are cut to barely cover the
knees, but cocktail-frocks were cut high
at the front, dipping to almost ankle-
length or longer at the back.
From London Hartnell brought several
of his elaborate jewel-embroidered ball-
gowns, one of which had been designed
for the Queen Mother’s Australian tour.
“Victoria” was -the name he gave to a
rich creamy satin gown, with a long,
fitted bodice and a very full skirt heavily
encrusted with precious stones. Drift-
away chiffon frocks had floating panels
and nicely moulded bodices. An after-
noon-frock in finest wool-chiffon was
charming. In a rich shade of cherry-red,
the wool was as fine as a silk-chiffon
and was cut with the high waistline and
soft fichu-neckline. In the more brilliant
tonings was a cocktail- or theatre-frock
in a black, brown and gold rose-
patterned brocade. It featured two
double loose panels lined with black
velvet in front of the skirt. The original
frock was bought in London by the
Duchess of Kent.
Pauline Anne, youngest daughter of
the late Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Griffin,
formerly of Hobart, has announced'her
engagement to Patrick, only son of Mr.
and Mrs. J. S. A. Browne, of Fairfield.
Press-officer for the Myer Emporium,
Pauline also does work on Channel 2
in the Woman’s World programme, and
writes and records talks for the A.B.C.
Women’s National Session. Her fiance
is advertising-manager for a large retail-
store. Her engagement-ring is a square-
cut sapphire set in a cluster of diamonds.
Wedding is planned for early next year.

Of inter-State interest was the marriage
at Holy Trinity, Kew, of Nancy Janet,
elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R. F.
Kelsall, of Foxton Park, Euroa, and
Neil Buzacott, elder son of Mr. and Mrs.
G. A. Creagh, of Nedlands (W.A.). The
bride’s gown of white silk-nylon over
taffeta, embroidered in a rose-design, had
a boat-shaped neckline, long pointed
sleeves, and the waist at the back was
low and finished with a large bow with
ends forming a slight train. From a
satin headpiece fell a short tulle veil,
and she carried a trail of white orchids
and lily-of-the-valley. The bride’s sister
Kathleen and Jan Hirst attended her,
wearing ballerina frocks of pale-blue
embossed nylon-chiffon cut on Princess-
lines. In their hair were blue satin
bandeaux finished with a . bow at the
back. Adrian Turnbull was best man.
and Max Huntington groomsman.
Reception was at Butleigh Wootton.
Caulfield Cup day brought out a crop
of colorful hats —tiny floral-wigs, toques,
curvettes and medium-sized straws
finished with floral trims. They were
in every color of the rainbow, favorite
flowers being lilac, lily-of-the-valley,
roses, geraniums, daisies and even sun-
flowers.
Lady Manifold wore a white cloque
raincoat with her blue suit and a small
ostrich-feather hat. Mrs. John Faulkner
had for her grey-and-brown tweed suit
a high brown turban finished with a. band
of burnt-orange jersey. Mrs. Roy
Ricker’s choice was a royal-blue suit and
tiny petunia flower-toque. Mrs. Douglas
Bowden covered her bright-blue floral
frock with a deep-royal-blue coat; her
high head-hugging turban was in match-
ing blue. Mrs. John Calder’s raincoat
was very attractive. Of striped corded
poplin in white, with black, beige and
pale-green stripes, it was worn with a
draped green-velvet hat.

was of deep-rose chiffon; Mrs. L. R.
Buxton chose a short bouffant frock of
pale-beige satin embroidered in brown
and gold-leaf design; Mrs. Edward

The Australian - Asian Association’s
Women’s Group organised the
mannequin-parade held at Menzies’
Hotel, when girls and young children
wore national dress in lovely Oriental
fabrics. The countries represented were
Indonesia, Ceylon, India, Malaya, the
Republic of China, Japan, Vietnam, the
Philippines, Borneo and Thailand.
Several pretty Australian girls wore
frocks made of fabrics from the East.
Mrs. R. T„ Breen (she is president of
the Women’s Group), assisted by Lady
Selleck, Mrs. John Chaldjian and the
wife of the president of the Australian-
Asian Association (Lady Lowe), wel-
comed Lady Brooks, Mrs. Henry Bolte
(the wife of the Premier), the Lady
Mayoress (Mrs. F. W. Thomas) and
Senator Ivy Wedgwood.
With her coat-frock of navy silk-taffeta
her Excellency wore a cap of orchid-
pink flowers. Mrs. Bolte chose a wool-
frock in sage-green tonings with a tiny
hat of white lilac caught in front with
a bow of emerald-green ribbon. A gay
little sou’-wester hat in rose-pink was
worn by Senator Wedgwood with her
navy suit


SYDNEY
Dancing is a thing, one feels, that Aus-
tralians should do well. It expresses
liveliness of spirit that people say we
possess, and is in its essence carefree and
joyous. Yet so many of us are content
to “walk around to the music” at dances,
get some general vague idea of how to
do the samba and “just follow your
partner” (who often thinks dancing
means shuffling to the slow music and
skipping to the fast). The youngsters do
“rock-’n’-roll” in the corners of the ball-
room, which is vital but seems to have
little variety, and the elders interpret the
music as they are able. Perhaps it is
just another expression of individualism,
but it does not give the dance much style.
One often wonders why, considering
the care that has been taken with the
decor at dances, the dresses, the music
and the organisation generally, the
dancing itself is not more beautiful.
Still, hope that this may eventually be
achieved, and a realisation that Aus-
tralians really are good dancers, came
from a visit to the Ballroom Dancing
Championship Finals for Australasia,
which were held at the Trocadero during
the week. To this contest had come
representatives of Australia’s six States
and New Zealand, all of whom had won
the championships in their home-section.
The most thrilling event was the
amateur championship for modern danc-
ing, which was contested by the seven
couples who were champions in their own
States. One of the judges, Miss Rita
Martin, of South Australia, who herself
has represented Australia abroad, said
she had never seen lovelier dancing any-
where. It was won by the couple from
Queensland, Thelma O’Neill and Eric
Crickmore, who were outstanding in
brilliant company. One could not help
thinking that Miss O’Neill, tall, slender
and vital, was, in her bouffant dress of
sunset and yellow net embroidered with
golden sequins, a wonderful representative
of Queensland, the State of the golden
sunshine.
Another lovely dress was worn by
N.S.W. representative Jan Metcalfe, who
with her partner Des Matthews carried
off two prizes: the Australian champion-
ship for Latin-American dancing and the
championship for old-time dancing, both
amateur. Her dress of apple-green net
embroidered with emerald sequins was
so cleverly cut in layers that every part
of it seemed to dance as she moved. A
dress which also had this quality—white
net embroidered in green with a foam
of green and white petticoats—was worn
by Mrs. Linda Cornwell (N.S.W.), winner
with Mr. Arthur Cornwell of the cham-
pionship for professional modern-
dancing. All the dresses were spectacular
—M iss Dot Rankin’s (from Melbourne)
in flame and gold was very striking—
and the ballroom was a lovely sight to
behold as the contestants skimmed,
floated and seemed even to fly across the
floor.
One of the judges, Mr. Albert 8001,
of Victoria, remarked that if he were
a dictator he would make it illegal for
anyone to dance in public unless they
had been taught by qualified teachers.
He had a twinkle in his eye as he said it.
It was a joke, of course, but, you know,
there is an idea there.

“The Mikado” was chosen for the 25th
annual production of Gilbert and Sulli-
van opera by the junior boys of. St.
Aloysius College, and once again the
excellence of the costumes brought
delighted admiration from the audience.
Beaded, sequinned and made from rich
silks and brocades, they were the work
of the ladies’ committee headed by Mrs.
W. E. Wallis. In the audience one noted
Miss Dorrie Meagher, Mrs. Harry Wind-
sor, Mrs. Arnold Carter, Mrs. Bill
Sheldon, Dr. and Mrs. Tom Bateman
and Mr. and Mrs. Austin Punch (young
Austin Punch sang the part of Katisha
with almost professional aplomb).
Joanna McCathie, who is the younger
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ken McCathie,
of Vaucluse, follows the family tradition
in studying fashion, and has been very
busy of late compering mannequin-
parades as part of the 75th-birthday cele-
brations of McCathie’s, Ltd., which was
founded by her great-grandmother, Mrs.
Harriet McCathie, in 1883. Since return-
ing two years ago from a trip abroad
with her parents Joanna has taken a
course in the presentation and compering
of fashion-shows. Her photo is by
Norton Trevaire.
“Go out and sell” seems to be the
motto of Mr. Norman Hartnell, here
this week to show the fashion-goods
which he is just now launching on the
Australian market. Already his empire
(or perhaps one should say “common-
wealth” these days) extends to nearly
all parts of the English-speaking world,
and in addition to dresses and coats he
sells scent, jewellery, stockings, lingerie,
hats and furs.
At the parades held at David Jones’
during the week Mr. Hartnell showed
day-dresses priced at from £l5 to £25
and some of the luxurious evening-
gowns which formed part of his London
collection. These were of the £lOO-or-
more class and created great interest, as
Mr. Hartnell is primarily regarded here
as the creator of those beautiful gowns
worn by the Queen and the Queen
Mother on their visits to Australia.
Mr. Hartnell, who has been studying
our Sydney crowds, said he was surprised
at the standard of dressing. He must
also have been surprised at the variety
of that same dressing, for in these spring
days, when the sun shines hot and the
wind blows cold, one sees the greatest
assortment possible in our streets.
Women may be seen muffled in great-
coats and scarfs walking with cotton-
clad girls, hatless, wrapless and sleeve-
less ; and in the midst of a covey of
business-girls dressed along the twin-set-
and-pleated-skirt lines will be seen a blithe
spirit in bouffant nylon or a silken
chemise-dress.

Distinguished English film-director
Paul Rotha, who is visiting Australia
under the auspices of Unesco, and who
was a special speaker at the recent Film
Festival, was supposed to be entertained
at a sherry-party at the Commonwealth
Society’s rooms last week, but, as it
turned out, it was Mr. Rotha who did
the entertaining. He offered to answer
questions without notice, and as they
were pelted at him from all directions
(some of them bodyliners, too) he batted
them all back with coolness and vigor.
It was interesting to hear that Mr. Rotha
is a devotee of westerns, and cited “High
Noon” as one of the best films he has
seen. He believes that films have much
to offer that TV cannot attempt (“Could
TV give us ‘the Ten Commandments’?”
he asked), and that films in the future
should concentrate on good stories, well
told. He is very much opposed to the
present trend, which presents violence

A seminar on Women and Local
Government will be held at Manning
House, Sydney University, on Friday
evening, October 31, and during the day
on Saturday, November 1. Speakers will
include Miss Ruth Atkins (lecturer in
government at the University of Tech-
nology), Aid. M. Propsting and Mr. R. D.
Stuckey (Town Clerk at Hunter’s Hill).
On Saturday morning there will be a
discussion of “Current Problems of Local
Councils,” and after lunch a group-
discussion on “Participation of Women
in Public Life,” led by Mrs. Jean Daly
(Australian representative at the U.N.
Status of Women Commission) and Mrs.
Madge Dawson (of the University's
Department of Tutorial Classes). The
seminar is open to all women wanting
to know more of local-government.


him. He lasted, in fact, precisely one
year.
The sacking was gentle enough;
indeed the editor, when James asked
for a thumping rise, merely pointed
out that his articles had evoked no
public response whatever, except for
one hostile letter, and suggested that,
writing a shorter, more popular column,
he do less work for the same money.
But James, who thereupon resigned—
as he was meant to do —was exceed-
ingly annoyed about it. His column,
he said in a phrase that pleased him
so much that he repeated it half-a-
dozen times in subsequent novels and
diaries, was “the worst he could do for
the money.”
The editor had further softened the
blow by saying that the articles were
more suited for a magazine than a daily
newspaper; but that is the sort of thing
you can say very safely when you don’t
happen to be editing a magazine. The
truth is, they were too highbrow for a
daily; and too thin and bloodless for
good magazine-writing.
Yet, at this date, and with Henry
James’s reputation behind them, they
make a pleasing enough book. For
one thing, they are not only Henry
James talking but Henry James almost
down to earth. He did not seem then
to have developed the more painful
convolutions of the comma, the dash
and the parenthesis that marked his
later prose, and he had something
definite to talk about: plays, a few
celebrities, paintings, books and the
weather. He was very good indeed on
the weather: —
The huge towers of Notre Dame,
rising with their blue-grey tone from
the midst of the great mass round
which the river divides, the great
Arc de Triomphe answering them
with equal majesty in the opposite
distance, the splendid continuous line
of the Louvre between, and over it
all the charming coloring of Paris
on certain days—the brightness, the
pearly greys, the flicker of light, the
good taste, as it were, of the
atmosphere—all this is an entertain-
ment which even custom does not
stale.
He could hardly be said to be
equally reliable on the painters, or at
any rate the Impressionists, whom he
compared unfavorably with Holman
Hunt:—
pr.ir.This attitude has something in
common with that of the English
Pre-Raphaelites, twenty years ago,
but this little band is on all grounds
less interesting than the group out
of which Millais and Holman Hunt
rose into fame. None of its members
show signs of possessing first-rate
talents, and indeed the “Impres-
sionist” doctrines strike me as in-
compatible, in an artist’s mind, with
the existence of first-rate talent.
But still, what art-critic has not been
mistaken from time to time, either by
condemning the new or deriding the
old? Henry James was at least on
firm ground in his admiration of
Delacroix and in his meticulous disap-
proval of Meissonier’s battle-pictures;
and, right or wrong, he always remains
mildly interesting.
All the letters have style, of course;
and a sort of thin vitality, as if he were
just clinging to life by his teeth; and,
more importantly, those flashes of
honest, almost vulgar wit when he
unbent from his pose for a moment:
“The treatment of animals, in statuary,
had always been a compromise.... and
the lion, in particular, had figured as a
sort of ingenious compound of the
sphinx and the poodle.”
The Test of the Test-tube
In volume five of the Civil series of
“Australia in the War of 1939-1945,”
The Role of Science and Industry
(Australian War Memorial), Professor
D. P. Mellor, Head of the School of
Chemistry at the N.S.W. University of
Technology, has got the utmost general
interest out of a difficult technical
undertaking. He has not sacrificed
technical precision to the doubtful
purpose of making the unscientific
reader think he understands science;
but you can read him at different levels
of profundity as you can read Shak-
speare for the story or for the poetry.
For even so uninformed and unscien-
tific a reader as the present reviewer, for
instance, it comes as a bit of a shock
that there has been a torpedo-factory
in North Sydney since around 1941;
that its first'* torpedo, tested early in
1944 at Pittwater, worked so well that
it needed no adjustment; that women
worked on it with greater patience
and “sometimes more highly developed
mechanical sense” than men; and that
the factory became so efficient that
it was continued after the war, making
the 21in. torpedo “the largest in use
by the British Navy” —although none
of its torpedoes were in time for use
in World War 11.
Moreover, if you want to know any-
thing about the torpedo you will find
a great deal about it here, with such
sidelights as that the reason why the
Jap midget subs, missed the Chicago
was that they had carelessly used a
metal in their torpedo-gyroscopes that
didn’t resist corrosion, and a slight
rusting turned the torpedo off its path.
But scientific honors were even —the
radar-loops under the entrance of
Sydney Harbor didn’t warn watchers of
the automatic recorder about the midget
subs. However, says Mellor, scientific
honor being at stake: —
An examination of the record after
the event did.... disclose small
variations on the magnetic field of
the detecting loop commensurate with
the size of the submarine and there-
fore too small to be detected except
by careful scrutiny.
The speed and size of the Australian
war-effort are equally surprising.
Although optical-glass had never been
made in Australia, and British makers
had warned Australian experts that
they’d never make it under four years,
they made it in ten months; while Aus-
tralia made 33,643 small craft of 162
different kinds for the invasion fleet of
the Pacific. One went back and read
that twice—it would be a good record
for a toy-factory; but they are itemised
in a footnote, and, adds Mellor, “most
of them* were built within about two
years”:—
They included: 584 powered steel
craft, including landing-craft; 1158
un powered steel craft; 1090 powered
wooden craft; 2144 unpowered
wooden craft; 14,389 N.L. pon-
toons ; 8276 lifeboats, dinghies and
miscellaneous craft.
In his survey of war-time food-
production Mellor talks of the provi-
sion of fertiliser, the study of heat in
stored wheat, the soldiers’ ration, the
rise of dehydrated vegetables from
2,000,0001 b. in 1942 to 24,000,0001 b. in
1944; and the canning of carrots —of
which there were 926,000 cases of two-
dozen cans in 1945. In 1944
Australian engineering firms, making
much of their own machinery, turned-
out 1,250,000,000 cans. Because of the
shortage of tinplate, they found means
of using some 20,000,000 cans twice.
Corrosion of cans caused the greatest
loss of foodstuff in the tropics; if
moisture settled upon one can it would
produce a pinhole through which the
contents, would putrify and eventually
squirt moisture on other cans. Twenty
per cent; of a stack thus affected would
write-off the rest; and at one base-
depot 90,000 cans of fish were a com-
plete loss. The ordinary can lasted
two months; lacquered, four or five
months, in the tropics.
Though the Director of Munitions,
Essington Lewis, head of the whole
caboose (“perhaps the most responsible
position of its kind ever allotted to an
Australian”), gets a couple of apprecia-
tive pages, most of the heroes of these
efforts must remain content with the
two- or three-line biographies in small
type which must average almost one
to a page; but Professor Mellor has an
eye for the colorful —i.e., the Wiles
who invented the Army pressure-
cooker that so pleased Sir Stanton
Hicks; 25-year-old Evelyn Owen leav-
ing his gun in a sugarbag outside the
flat of his neighbor, V. A. Wardell, of

A Great Name in Books
Lysaghts; Sir (then Mr.) Percy Spender
forcing the Owen-gun into production
over Army objections, and as his last
act as Minister for Army increasing it
from 100 to 2000; Professor Cotton
testing his air-padded anti-blackout
suit to a degree of 9G (“the average
pilot blacked-out for several seconds
when exposed to about 5G or 6G”);
and if the heavy expenditure of money
and work on the development of an
Australian tank produced a tour-de-
force of one-piece design which was
never allowed to fight, it also produced
the unnamed firing-officer who. when
the 80ft. lanyard failed to fire the 25-
pounder, the first gun of such calibre to
be installed in a tank, went into the
turret and, “disregarding all the
unknown factors and dangers, released
the firing-trigger with his hand.”
The other big names in this book are
those of the factories and engineering
businesses. A lawnmower-factory in
South Australia was making parts for
North Sydney torpedoes; but the
biggest spread was in the merchant-
shipbuilding programme:—
Machine-shops in the sugarcane-
growing centres of Northern Queens-
land previously engaged in repairing
machinery for sugar-mills, made
windlasses and winches. The Railway
Workshops at Ipswich, Queensland,
and Midland Junction, Western Aus-
tralia, cast bronze propellers, though
they had never before attempted this
kind of work. Small shipyards in
Western and South Australia made
many hundreds of lifeboats.
Besides producing 3500 aircraft of
nine types and almost 3000 aircraft-
engines of three types, the Australian
aircraft-industry devised a quick test-
to-destruction of aircraft wings which
was still, in 1947, ahead of British and
U.S. methods....
It would be hard, by quoting, to
suggest the detail in this book, which
is more a survey of Australia’s resources
of men, factories and materials, and
the story of how they crowded 25 years
of development into five years of war.
Beginning in the between-wars period.
Professor Mellor is seen continually
rejoicing as under war-time pressure
Australia adds new mining-develop-
ments, new mechanical skills, a huge
dock in Sydney and another in Bris-
bane, an aircraft-industry, a motor-
industry, new food-storing techniques,
to her capacity during the ensuing
peace. And he ends with a survey of
the 10 years after the war, considering
such things as the aluminium-industry,
the motor-industry, the tinplate-
industry, the Snowy River scheme, the
Australian Academy of Science, the
C.5.1.R.0., the Reconstruction Train-
ing Scheme, the National University at
Canberra and the N. S. Wales Uni-
versity of Technology, where he works:
The successful application of
science to war created a deep impres-
sion on the community at large and
heightened its appreciation of the
part played by science generally in
the modern world. Consequently,
after the war research received much
stronger financial support from gov-
ernments than it had ever previously
enjoyed in this country, and the
output of scientific research reached
new levels in quality and diversity.
Reviewed Briefly
Two Women: Alberto Moravia
(Seeker and Warburg). A study of the
gradual moral degradation of a
Roman shopkeeper and her daughter
during the Allied invasion of Italy.
Fleeing from the air-raids, they wander
southward in the mountains, believing,
like most of the evacuees, that the
Allies will magically restore their lives
to normal. They are pushed from place
to place; food gets scarce; Moroccan
soldiers rape the daughter; the mother
is reduced to petty thieving. The
ignorance, pride and political despair
which almost ruined Italy are com-
passionately revealed.

The Brass Butterfly: William Golding
(Faber). What happens when a young
genius invents a steamship, a high-
explosive and a printing-process in
third-century Rome? According to this
play, not very much: the author has
wisely avoided the chain-of-events kind
of farce that the idea suggests, pro-
viding instead only enough action (and
this confined to the Emperors Capri
villa) to support a lot of fluent, witty
and urbane comment on expediencj,
determinism and man's ability to con-
trol his own creations. It is smoothly
constructed with a fine sense of theatre,
and the dialogue is sometimes almost
Shavian in its nimble twisting and
turning of ideas.
