Sheltered in the Bay of
Islands (149 of them) north
of Auckland, is Waitangi,
the newest of New Zealand's
new-look international resorts.
There are do-nothing things to
do like loafing around the heated
pool over a beer or two, ambling
by foot, car or boat through a
charming, historic district. Or
get out on the blue waters to haul
in a swordfish, just as Zane Grey
did. Take a look at a superb
collection of Maori carvings;
golf on a course famous for its
hill-striding fairways. And when
you feel like a day out, you can
visit to the calm green heart of
a Kauri Forest, or drive along
the Ninety Mile Beach. (In
the season, try digging for
toheroas.)

At the waterside Waitangi

The cellar contains 40 international

LETTERS
Writers and Conscripts
Sir,
It is sad to see a professor of
philosophy confusing what is said with
who says it. But this is what Professor
Armstrong appears to be doing in the
letter quoted in “Writers and Con-
scripts” (8., July 2).
Disregarding the gimcrack framework
of intellectual patronage and guilt-by-
association which you put around the
letter of the 60 writers (when, by the
way, are you going to separate your
editorials from your news?), Professor
Armstrong’s comments raise a pertinent
question: with whom is it permissible
to associate oneself in the defence of a
particular point of view?
Professor Armstrong appears to in-
habit a Panglossian universe in which
he only associates himself with those
people he is in complete agreement with
on all questions. Those of us who live
in the real world have to content our-
selves with slightly less than that. I
can only speak for myself, but for me
life is a matter of temporary alliances,
and because I agree with a Communist
on Vietnam does not mean that I agree
with him on anything else. There are
probably Christians in the 60: I dis-
agree with them about religion. There
are Socialists: I disagree with them
about politics. There are Humanists:
I disagree with them about the moral
worth of altruism. But on this one
question I agree with them, and there-
fore can stand with them.
Should I find an apologist for General
Franco or Doctor Verwoerd who
opposed the jailing of the Russian
writers I should stand with him on this
one question (I should have to say
to him, of course, that his attitude,
considering the position of writers in
South Africa and Spain, was an un-
examined one). The fear of worse
things makes for strange alliances. One
need only cite the United States’ sup-
port of the military dictatorship of
Chiang Kai-shek, Franco, and Salazar.
Survival is not always a question of
clean hands and clean associations. I
can even imagine myself agreeing on
particular questions with that other
respectable military dictator, Marshal
Ky.

Why the IBM 6400
accounting machine
can't be matched:
Completeness!
5
s
We designed the IBM 6400 accounting machine
with more hardware features per dollar than
any other machine on the market. But, to
judge the true completeness of an accounting
system one must look at more than raw hard-
ware. It's the depth and intensity of service
that makes an accounting system complete.
Here’s the IBM stance on completeness:
The IBM representative is a thoroughly
schooled specialist. His job is to focus the
entire resources of IBM on your problems.
He tailors a 6400 system to your exact needs.
Helps you get the system operating on time.
Helps you get the right information on systems
design and programming procedures, when
you need it. In other words, he turns promises
into actual performance.
Look at the hardware features of the 6400

* Largest alpha numeric storage on ledger
card * Less manual operation—less risk of
operator error * Accuracy checks on both
reading and recording * Unique single-element
printing head eliminates moving carriage—
provides better forms handling * Fully tran-
sistorized small scale computer—one of the
most reliable computing mechanisms yet
devised by IBM.
The IBM 6400 not only offers you increased
efficiency in accounting operation, it also
offers greater control over operations through
numerous by-product reports and analyses.

Dutton, Provocateur
Sir,
All the time I was reading Geoffrey
Dutton’s article (8., July 2\), I kept
thinking of my old TV favorite Max-
well Smart. There’s this nasty situation
in Adelaide, you see: tempers rising;
tensions mounting; monarchists, re-
publicans at one another’s throats; op-
pressed plebs muttering heresies; in-
tellectuals demanding blood . . . And
slap in the centre of chaos? Who? None
other than agent provocateur (Max)
Dutton, notorious, defiant “and lov-
ing every minute!”
I admire Mr. Dutton’s energy; his
poetry; what he’s doing for Australian
publishing. Not his attempts to inflate
enthusiasm to sell his books. Mon-
archists v. republicans may have split
South Australia in two. But if Mr. Dut-
ton imagines this (plus some outside
comment from a few “professional in-
tellectuals”) makes it a burning national
issue, he should stop being such a busy
fish in his own pond and start research-
ing the apathetic waters of other States.

Sir,
In Britain and the Scandinavian
monarchies there is a personal rela-
tionship in the sense that the monarch
and the people belong to each other.
The lack of this relationship in Aus-
tralia did not matter when Australians
had the sense of belonging to some-
thing wider the British Empire. A
Commonwealth containing some repub-
lics which are despotic rather than
democratic does not fill the gap. With
the liquidation of the British Empire
many people think that a monarchy
by proxy is an anachronism. The
question is how long will people in Aus-
tralia, who are straining to build a first-
class nation, be content for Australia to
remain a second-class monarchy?

Vietnam’s Only Solution
Sir,
As another Australian living in the
United States, I’d like to present £n
attitude different from that of Mrs.
Christine Fox (8., May 21). THE
BULLETIN coverage of the Vietnam
issue seems to me to have been quite
adequate and of a quite discerning
nature. The points of view have been
of considerable interest to American
friends here with whom I’ve shared
them. Perhaps Mrs. Fox’s interpretation
of “inadequate coverage” is that her
own point of view is too seldom ex-
pressed. Like so many dissenters from
the national policy here in Hawaii, Mrs.
Fox seems unable to realise that the
paucity of protesters does not necessar-
ily imply that all who do not protest
are either, as she arbitrarily categorises
them, victims of “ignorance, misinfor-
mation, or just plain stupidity.” It
probably means that the majority of
thinking people have weighed the issues
and found the protesters’ cause wanting.
Very few people want to take a stand
FOR war, but many people reluctantly
face reality and feel the present struggle
may be the only solution in Vietnam,
They may feel this way even while
not docilely agreeing with every aspect
of their respective government’s policy
or with every single means currently
employed in the struggle. •
I know from personal experience how
grateful South Koreans are that men
of other nations did not consider South
Korea beyond their sphere of interest
in 1950. I work on the presumption
that South Vietnamese will also be


Mrs. Jones buys margarine,
her neighbour buys butter...
is Mrs. Jones
Au^Saii?
Last year, Mrs. Jones and tens of thousands of other Aus-
tralian housewives saved a combined $11,250,000 out of
their household budgets because they preferred margarine.
Tens of thousands more housewives bought poly-unsaturated
margarine, which sells at the same price as butter, simply
because they liked the way it spreads and felt it was better
for their families.
Australian butter is as fine a product as any in the world, no
housewife should ever be denied its use. Surely the same is
true of Australian margarine made with Australian vegetable
oils. Why, then, must the housewife be denied a free and
abundant supply of Australian margarine? Why is the manu-
facture and sale of margarine under a stringent and com-
pletely outdated quota system set up 25 years ago?
The Quota System and how it happened
A quarter of a century ago, when the raw material used in
margarine was largely imported, State Governments imposed
heavy quota restrictions on the amount of table margarine
which could be sold, as well as regulating the amount of
vegetable oil that could be used in cooking margarines. At
the time, the Australian Dairy Industry needed all the help it
could get, and restricting margarine seemed the logical thing
to do. Every country has the right to protect and cherish
every one of its primary industries. However, that right can
hardly extend to protecting one Australian primary industry
at the expense of another Australian primary industry. And
this is largely what has happened.
The birth of a New Australian Primary Industry
Australia has a new and dynamic primary industry, as impor-
tant to our future as wheat and maize and oats ... it is the
Edible Oilseeds Industry. Safflower Oil, Cotton Oil and Peanut
Oil. Margarine is the major user of these three oils, but out-
dated controls restrict the manufacture of table margarine to
a level well below popular public demand even when they are
made from these pure home-grown oils. These controls dic-
tate that only minor amounts of Australian vegetable oils can
be used in retail cooking margarines.
Not only is the Australian housewife getting a raw deal, but
the biggest potential boom in Australian primary industry is
threatened with going bust. The men who plant safflower,
cotton and peanuts are not asking for special consideration,
but only that the outdated controls imposed a quarter of a
century ago be lifted and that they be allowed to move
forward.
The vision to get going
Right from the start, the growth and the expansion of the
Edible Oilseeds Industry has been forcefully supported by the
vision of one Australian company, Marrickville Margarine Pty.
Ltd. (a subsidiary of Marrickville Holdings Ltd.). It was largely
they who carved out a major new market, they who paid for
the thousands of hours of research, and it was they who
developed sales that encouraged the farmer to build a new
staple crop.
From the home-grown safflower oil, they made a new kind of
margarine, they called it poly-unsaturated MIRACLE, a product
of such quality, it successfully competes at the same price as
butter. Similarly, new products and new margarines are being
developed from peanut oil and cotton oil.
These products must benefit the housewife, and they can be
made from raw materials that will put millions of dollars into
the pockets of the Australian farmer.
Congratulations, Mrs. Jones!

a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You'll be
pleasantly surprised.

The Teachers’ Dilemma
Sir,
Your contributor Brian Buckley refers
(8., June 25) to a teachers’ college
in the grounds of one of our univer-
sities where, according to him, the course
offered is regarded by the university
staff as a joke or worse. I am well
aware that these comments could not
apply to Sydney Teachers’ College
and, indeed, there is evidence in the
article that the author had in mind
an institution in another State but
it seems at least possible that many of
your wide range of Sydney readers will
construe them as so applying. I should
greatly deplore either the construction
or the error, as the case may be.
\s head of this department, I greatly
value the co-operation and opinion of
my professional colleagues in the Geog-
raphy Department of the Sydney
Teachers’ College. I think it vital that
universities, organisations concerned
with teacher-training, and teachers’
societies should work closely together,
and I am gratified to record the over-
lapping aims and membership of this
department, the Teachers’ College
Geography Department, the Geographi-
cal Society of New South Wales, and the
N.S.W. Geographical Teachers’ Associ-
ation. It seems only fair to claim that
in the current revolution of geographi-
cal teaching, university staff and the
staff of the Sydney Teachers’ College
see completely eye-to-eye.
Furthermore, I feel obliged to object
strongly to any implication that univer-
sity aims are in any way opposed to
the aims of teacher-training. Admit-
tedly, academic training differs in kind
from professional training; but who
would wish to argue this point? And,
so far as I can judge, academics who
have been teacher-trained are, as a
group, the better for their training. We
should, I think, do better to encourage
solidarity and co-operation than to pro-
mote needless discord among people
who have the common duty of teaching,
at whatever level.

Sir,
Brian Buckley’s educational myths
(8., June 25) are terrifyingly accurate.
From personal experience in one of
our State Education Departments I
can testify to the validity of all his
remarks. Perhaps he should have in-
cluded Myth No. 4: The Administrator
whether Inspector or Headmaster
is competent to inspect or run a school.
One country high school, of my per-
sonal acquaintance, has had four
resignations of qualified staff since last
December , two of these resignations
were science teachers with four years’
• ry U
university training. Ihe responsibility
r • r- l- • . . 7
for these resignations lies m the in-
competence of the administrators who,
by their parochial and insular outlook
unwittingly encourage that lack of
initiative and virility which is so essen-
tial to a school. We need a decentral-
ised, non-inspectorial system. Then we
shall see the pedagogical sparks fly!!

I was pleased that THE BULLETIN

endorsed with his historical knowledge
that she is qualified to be a saint.
(8., June 18.) I was, however, a little
bewildered and amused to find as I
read on that Mr. Ellis thought he was
actually playing, devil’s advocate, by
setting out to show that she was a saint
but not “a great Roman Catholic.”
His reasons are ' certainly peculiar

HOW
BIG
IS
BIGGEST?
When talking of industry, there can be no question about it the Railways of Australia are outstandingly
the biggest. Collectively, they represent a capital investment of $1,804 million. As the nation’s biggest
employer, they directly give employment to 129,000 men and women; indirectly, they give employment to
scores of thousands more —from those who build their locomotives to those who supply carpets for the floors
of their air-conditioned trains.
HOW blp IS biggest. The Railways of Australia operate 2,763 locomotives, 7,500 passenger vehicles
and 90,009 goods wagons over 25,000 route miles; have a turnover of $476 million; pay out nearly $330
million in salaries and wages; buy goods and materials to the value of $l2B million.
Last year, the trains of the Railways of Australia ran 96 million miles (a distance to beyond the sun),
carried 465 million passengers and moved 65 million tons of freight in a never-ending collection and
distribution of the nation’s wealth. Railway support means more jobs for more Australians to work
towards the ideal of a more progressive, more prosperous Australia.

ones. He offers in evidence that her
work could not have been (as she
herself supposed) of Catholic religious
inspiration because it was governed by
basic natural human morality and con-
cern; that she “showed as little devo-
tion to the Church of Rome as she
did to any other church” because she
paid no regard at all to the religious
affiliations of those needing help,
sought no sectional advantage for
Catholics, and actually encouraged
people of Protestant persuasion to prac-
tise their religion. He adds that she
would have laughed at the thought of
being St. Caroline (quite true, I should
think) and was “very human, very
vital, no prig”—therefore, presumably,
not a truly Catholic saint!
Unfortunately, Mr. Ellis goes further
and tries to accumulate little indirect
suggestions. “Possibly” she only be-
came a Catholic because her husband
was one at least someone suggested
this, though Mr. Ellis does not know
on what grounds. (Suttor says she be-
came a Catholic at 19 and married
later; Kiddle rejects any notion of a
“mere conversion of convenience” as
not in her character.) He hazards a
guess that her husband and devoted
collaborator, Major Chisholm, “was not
a very encouraging communicant.” (I
don’t know what this means, and the
vagufely negative suggestion without
evidence seems quite gratuitous.) We
are told also that one “at least” of
her sons married outside the Catholic
Church. (I don’t know about this, but,
if so, what does it contribute and
why the telltale empressment of the
phrase “at least”? One of her sons
also studied for the priesthood in Rome
but, again, what does that tell us?)
Mr. Ellis turns round at one point
and says that “none of these things
has any bearing on the need or other-
wise for her canonisation.” But if they
go to show that she was not a “great
Catholic,” deeply devoted to her
church, living and working professedly
and truly by its doctrine and inspira-
tion, they would indeed have some
bearing. If all that Mr. Ellis means
is that her vision and practice were
beyond the range of many Catholics
in Australia, I had already said or
implied this, and there is no argument
—but Mr. Ellis seems constantly to be
trying to convey something more: that
he would prefer to transform her, and
thinks he can do so, into a deistical-
humanitarian sort of person more in
keeping with the Australian stereotype.
But this cannot be done if Kiddle and
Suttor are to be given any credit at all.
Certainly her contemporaries thought
that it could be done. Suttor says: “No
one, then, could be in any doubt of
Mrs. Chisholm’s popery.” The redoubt-
able Dr. Lang tried to destroy her
work precisely because “Mrs. Chisholm
is a Roman Catholic, a Roman Catho-
lic of no common caste, a perfect
devotee of the Papacy.”
Mr. Ellis assures me that had I lived
in Tasmania in those days I would
have needed a considerable amount of
iron in my constitution to nerve me

Second Mortgages
Sir,
The comments of J. C. Horsfall (8.,
June 25) on the progress of the Com-
monwealth’s Housing Loans Insurance
Corporation once again highlight the
rapid reaction of permanent building
societies in New South Wales to make
good use of this or any aid which
gives added protection for their clients,
investors, or borrowers. The major per-
manent building societies of this State
are using both the Government (HLIC)
and private (MGICA) mortgage insur-
ance schemes to good effect in the short
time they have been operating.
Already the normal lending limit of
75 percent of valuation has been pushed
higher by the existence of these
schemes and each week a growing num-
ber of high-ratio loans up to 95
percent are being made to families
wishing to buy a home. ‘
This is one of the most important
housing finance developments in recent
years because it is aiming a knock-out
punch against second mortgages, one of
the most crippling burdens of home
ownership during this decade.

JULY 16. 1966
More Money than Sense
IT is now a cliche that the greatest
Government weakness of the
Menzies Era was in defence. Our
military strength, far from being
increased in step with the potential
dangers and with our economic
capacity to support defence, was
steadily eroded. Only in late 1964
was an effort made to reverse the
dangerous policy of gradual uni-
lateral disarmament when a pro-
gram to raise annual spending on
defence by the modest amount of
s32om over three years was intro-
duced. This was little enough, for
since that time Vietnam has flared
up, and although the Indonesian
situation has quietened down
other threats have arisen and the
general political challenge of Com-
munist China is as acute as ever.
Yet a sense of urgency is still
lacking. There have been no major
additions to the defence program
and, more incredible still, the
armed forces are not even spending
the money they are allocated. The
figures released last week by the
Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, show
that s23m less was spent in the
financial year which just ended
than was allowed for in the Budget.
This is serious enough in itself, but
it is not even a full measure of the
amount by which spending has
been lagging behind budgetary
allotments. The Budget did not
provide for a number of small but
costly new commitments made
after August last year: the rate
of Army call-up was increased from
6900 to 8400 a year, bumping
Army costs up by around $10m;
the expansion of our effort in Viet-
nam must have boosted costs by
another $lO to s2om; on top of
that, s4om worth of extra equip-
ment planes for the Navy and patrol
boats was ordered during the year
and payments for at least a part
of this must have been made; and
finally last year there were wide-
spread increases in the wages of
both military and civilian staff of
the armed services. All in all the
real level of underspending would
seem to have been of the order of
s6om, not far short of ten percent
of the Budget allocation!
Some of this might be explained
by costs being lower than expec-
ted (although usually in defence
matters it is very much the other
way around). But basically it
must be assumed that the defence
build-up is simply being adminis-
tered without the necessary push
or sense of urgency. The plain
fact is that by our geography we are
situated in a region about twice
as dangerous as the countries of
Western Europe and yet we are
still only about half as well armed
as they. Sweden and Holland, for
example, with populations smaller
than ours, have armies twice as
large. The public has a right to
demand that the present build-up
be implemented with all necessary
speed and vigor. It may be neces-
sary to buy more equipment over-
seas than we would like if we had
the time to make it ourselves, but
our balance of payments is sur-
prisingly strong and we can well
afford to increase our purchaser
overseas.
Australians by and large trust
the Government’s political judg-
ment in foreign affairs. But they
will want reassurance that it has
the administrative dynamism to
provide the guts to make its policies
work.


THIS AUSTRALIA
The “Incoherent” Commissioners
AS always some of the reaction to the basic wage rise of $2 last week could have
been written in advance. The chairman of the National Employers’ Policy
Committee, Mr. W. G. Gerard, said gravely, “It will be a shock to employers.”
And in case anybody was actually
looking forward to getting the extra
$2, Mr. Arthur Calwell warned that
the decision could leave everybody
worse off. From Canberra, Peter Samuel
sums up the likely effects of the wage
increase and its meaning for the
economy. He writes:
The Commonwealth Conciliation and
Arbitration Commission could have
awarded the extra $2, because this was
the amount best designed to improve
cultural relations with Afghanistan. For
what matters to the wage-earner is the
amount by which his pay packet in-
creases. It does not matter by what
name the increase is described or by
what logic or illogic it is justified. And
the same applies in relation to the effect
on the economy.
For that statistical fellow, the average
wage-earner, who at present earns about
$5B a week, it will mean a rise in
income of about 3.5 percent. Like all
basic wage rises, it will be “progressive”
in its incidence, helping low-income
earners relatively more than high-
income earners. And with the com-
mendable decision to establish a mini-
mum margin, the effective minimum
wage is now set at $37.25. No one
knows how many people actually earn
the basic wage alone, if any at all in
fact do, but the decision means that
people close to the basic wage will get
a considerable proportionate rise in
income—up to 20 percent.
For the economy the decision is
eventually likely to boost the wage and
salary bill by close to $4OO million or
by 3.5 percent. This is somewhat larger
than the general trend increase in pro-
ductivity each year—most estimates put
this at a bit over 2 percent. On that
basis unit labor costs would rise by 1.5
percent. To the extent that private
businessmen and governments are un-
prepared to accept this erosion of their
profits, they would raise their prices and
charges by a corresponding amount. To
this extent the judgment may be con-
sidered inflationary.
In fact, it may not be so bad. The
remarkable level of spending on new
plant and equipment of the past two
years should be raising productivity by
more than usual this year; at a crude
guess productivity might rise by 3 per-
cent. So the economy may be able to
cope with the unusually large increase
in the wages bill without much pressure
on prices. It should give something of a
boost to consumer spending, a laggard
element in the economic scene of late.
But against this it will reduce profits
below what they would otherwise have
been and so perhaps cut at business
capital spending. On balance it un-
doubtedly means that the Treasurer,
Mr. McMahon, has less to give away
at Budget time.
The reasoning of the Arbitration
Commissioners in the latest judgment
is always of some interest. Sadly I have
to report that they have reached new
depths of economic illogic and incoher-
ence in their arguments. Economists
may argue about matters of detail and
problems of implementation, but they
are generally agreed on the proposition
that wages should not increase at a
greater rate than the trend of produc
tivity or they will be a source of infla-
tionary pressure. This, simply, is the
essence of counter-inflationary wages
policy. To follow such a policy cannot
guarantee there will be no inflation, for
that process has other stimulants. But
such a productivity-geared wages
policy is one prerequisite and an im-
portant one for price stability.
rp, . . , 7 ,
.j , ommissioners each spepd a con-
si erab e amount of time in their reports
explaining why they do not accept the
principles of such a policy as a guide
to the way they should fix wages. In
doing so they repeatedly mis-state and
misunderstand the argument which
underlies it. But that is a little beside
the point. What is rather ridiculous is
their view that by rejecting the wage-
fixing policy based on cost inflation
arguments they somehow magically ex-
tirpate the whole problem. They seem
to think that because economists cannot
spell out with certainty the exact effects
on prices of excessive wage increases
that these effects are thereby done away
with. They argue rather like the man
getting drunk who thinks he need not
worry how much more he drinks be-
cause he cannot predict exactly just
how acute his hangover is going to be.
Not being able to understand econo-
mic arguments, the Commissioners
simply deny their relevance. Thus Mr.
Winter said that the “only real func-
tion and duty of the Commission is to
prevent and settle industrial disputes,”
and Mr. Justice Wright put his position
this way: “I can say without equivoca-
tion that questions of political or
economic policy have no place in my
thinking, because I believe them to be
extraneous to the Commission’s function
of determining industrial disputes.”
It is easy to point out that the “indus-
trial dispute” inherent in national wages
cases can be successfully “settled” within
a very wide range of wage increases—it
could have been 50c extra or $5.00. Do
the Commissioners really think that the
system is likely to be bucked if they
keep within such a range?
So how do they hit on the $2 if
they so self-righteously reject out of
hand the productivity-gearing principle?
Presumably, they just pull it out of their
legal hats since they offer no alternative
method of estimation.
One Big Union
THERE are nearly 400 trade unions in Australia, and most are tiny. The giant
among them is the Australian Workers’ Union, whose origins go back to the
shearers and miners of the 1890 s.
The AWL and the Australian Coun-
cil °f Trade Unions have dominated
the blue-collar union stage since 1927,
ACTU was formed. The
ACTU now represents about 1,200,000
unionists and the AWU something
above 170,000. For political and
other reasons being the biggest Aus-
tralian union it has been able to
sta f|. itself the AWU has never
affiliated with the ACTU. But last week
its executive council meeting in Sydney
decided to recommend that the January
annual convention of the union decide
to join the ACTU. There is no doubt
that this recommendation will be
approved after 40 years of isolation.
The move is being hailed as a great
blow to the strength of the Communist
Party in the ACTU, and to outward
appearances this see™ a sound judg-
rvTiU A . 1 . t j °
“,. A ‘ tbe last “lienee of the
t e non-Communist sections of
the Labor movement won handsome
victories on a number of major issues
and also in the elections to the sixteen-
man ACTU interstate executive. A
significant success of the non-Com-
munist forces was the ACTU decision
to adopt a “master plan” to tighten the
control of the executive over strikes. At
present the executive contains one Com-
munist, three men who are regarded as
being pro-Communist on a number of
major issues, three who are regarded as
being middle of the road, and nine who
generally vote against Left-wing politi-
cal and industrial manoeuvres,
The presence of the AWU would
seem to clinch the numbers for the
non-Communist forces, and on most
industrial matters the Communists and
their supporters face defeat for many
years. In the political arena things may
jhhF eren t- Many of the so-called
moderate unions are not very con-
cfned with politics outside the bounds

area of foreign policy because they lack

pete.


The Embarrassing Mr. Holt
Holt in London-“My own is a four-letter name.”
VERY soon after Australia’s Prime Minister Harold Holt arrived in London
last week it was clear he was going to be an embarrassing guest. And not
only for Britain’s Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He went over the heads
of the politicians to appeal to British pride when he expressed regret that for the
first time in history Australian troops in Vietnam were fighting without British
troops alongside them.
Alan Reid reports that both in the
United States and in Britain, Holt has
shown that Australian foreign policy
is undergoing a radical re-thinking
mainly as a result of Holt’s direct
experience of the reality of South-East
Asia on his recent tour. Writes Reid:
Where Holt’s predecessor in the
Prime Ministership, Sir Robert Menzies,
walked the tightrope between the
American alliance and Australia’s tra-
ditional closeness to Britain with bulky
adeptness, and paid due regard to
British sensitivities, Holt, representative
of a new Australian generation, has
no such inhibitions. Holt has made no
secret of where he will come down
if he has to choose between Britain
and the American alliance. He will
come down firmly on the American
side, without being greatly concerned
about whether his pro-Americanism
embarrasses the British establishment.
For Holt, the choice is without pain.
His recent trip to South Vietnam has
undoubtedly influenced his thinking. It
is not without significance that in
virtually every speech he made in the
United States he drew attention to the
fact that Saigon was closer to Darwin
than Brisbane is to Perth.
Menzies could similarly appreciate
intellectually the significance to Aus-
tralia of that fact. He could, as he
did, establish the military alliance that
Australia now has with the United
States through the ANZUS treaty. But
he always gave the impression that
while intellectually he recognised the
importance to Australia of Asia, Asia
to him emotionally remained a land
mass to be crossed over, preferably
on the way to London.
To Holt, however, Asia is not just
a land mass. It is a place where
millions of people live, representing
half the world’s population, an area
that is in ferment and that is vividly
close to Australia’s north. It was with
this concept of Asia in mind that Holt
came out with his unequivocal support
for U.S. policy in Vietnam, and on
the same day that Wilson refused to
back the American decision to bomb
oil installations in Hanoi, declared that
Australia supported this action as a
military necessity.
For Wilson, Holt represents a
further embarrassment. Genuinely be-
lieving that Australia has a far more
direct concern in the Vietnam out-
come even than the U.S., Holt has been
criticising the attitude of European
countries. They were assisted by U.S.
strength and resources to get a breath-
ing space for the establishment of
political and economic stability in the
immediate post-war period. They should
assist the U.S. in Vietnam, so that the
non-Communist countries in the
South-East Asian area could get a
similar breathing space to build up
their economic strength.
Holt has exempted Britain from this
criticism because it has been contribut-
ing toward South-East Asian stability
with its policy of maintaining signifi-
cant forces east of Suez. Holt has
pointed out that this represents British
support for the U.S. in the area.
B UT Wilson is under pressure from
some of his supporters to withdraw
support completely from the U.S. on
the Vietnam issue. They do not like
the fact that while Wilson condemned
the extension of bombing in North
Vietnam he nevertheless publicly
expressed himself in approval of broad
U.S. policies and objectives in the
area. Wilson is in a difficult position.
If he does not withdraw all but token
forces from east of Suez he could be
in further trouble with a section of
his own supporters. If he does with-
draw, Holt would undoubtedly want
to know what about his promise to
Australia to remain in the area as a
significant power for as long as possible
a state of affairs on which Aus-
tralia was relying when it agreed to
assist Britain militarily in Singapore and
Malaysia in the resistance of the
Indonesian confrontation.
Wilson’s political opponents will
undoubtedly use the Australian Prime
Minister’s statements to further
embarrass the Wilson administration
and to accuse it of failing to honor
its undertakings to Australia.
But Holt’s presence is a potential
embarrassment for more than the
British Labor Government. A section
of the Conservative Opposition would
prefer to get right out of the area
east of Suez believing that Britain’s
future lies in Europe and not overseas.
This section has no enthusiasm about
an Australian Prime Minister putting
forward for internal British consump-
tion the view that the non-Communist
world is larger than Europe, and that
the industrialised nations of Europe
have a responsibility to back the U.S.
in keeping the non-Communist section
of a continent that contains half the
world’s population free from external
domination while it develops its own
resources.
Menzies was always careful not to
offend British feelings and sensitivities.
Holt is too concerned about Asia and
the march of events there to be simi-
larly concerned. It was these factors
that made Holt an embarrassing guest.

Doctors’ Own
A SIX-PAGE rather provincial-
looking newsletter published by
the Australian Medical Associa-
tion as a summary of its Fifth Federal
Assembly in Sydney recently could be
a pointer on things to come.
For more than a year the AMA has
been chewing over the idea of a medical
newspaper on the lines of “Medical
News,” a well-known and brightly pre-
sented British weekly that is not only
popular with thousands of U.K. doctors
but also with scientists, hospital and
health workers, including many Gov-
ernment employees. The Australian
Medical Association has sought techni-
cal as well as literary advice from
public relations consultants and has
gone to some lengths to obtain designs
even one or two dummy papers
in order to get an understanding of
what may be involved.
Whether this advice has included
guidance on production and distribution
costs, the type of skilled literary, sales
promotion, advertising, and office staff
not to speak of a string of medical
and scientific correspondents in key
centres throughout Australia which
would be necessary for a top-line
specialised publication has not been
disclosed. It would seem the AMA has
relied on advice from experts who sug-
gested that a medical newspaper was
(1) a practical possibility, (2) offered
some scope for profit, (3) could serve as
a valuable internal public relations
vehicle, and (4) might create a better
public image of the whole medical
profession.
B UT why should the AMA, which
already has one official publication,
the “Australian Medical Journal,” be
so keen on starting a second paper?
The AMJ already publishes every week
a great deal of clinical and scientific
material, as well as commentaries and
reviews on a variety of subjects, letters,
Government and university announce-
ments, plus advertisments. It is true the
AMA newspaper —if and when
published is to look different from
the AMJ. The idea is that the news-
paper will not rely on lengthy scientific
or clinical reports but mainly on
straightforward medical (including
medical-political) news written in such
a way that any interested person will
be quickly and accurately informed
without having to wade through yards
of technical jargon.
But the clue to the relative eagerness
to start an AMA newspaper lies in
quiet, behind-the-scenes overtures by
some British backers of “Medical News”
anxious to branch out to Australia.
Several Sydney doctors have been
claiming for a long time that some of
their colleagues throughout Australia
are in regular communication with the
British paper offering suggestions as
well as literary help to get it off the
ground here if its management can be
persuaded to take the plunge.
Some doctors argue that if “Medical
News” does not step into this specialised
Australian publishing vacuum some
enterprising pharmaceutical company,
sensing handsome profits, might show
sudden interest. It would appear then
that apprehension of what others might
do in the field of Australian medical
newspapering is influencing the AMA’s
thinking as much as its genuine interest
in better public relations and, in the
final analysis, a natural concern for
self-preservation.
But j s no t going to be easy finan-
dally. Most people nowadays have a
fair idea that publishing costs are high
and that the whole business is full of
risks. The AMA, however, thinks that
there will be a guaranteed circulation
because most of the doctors would be
expected to buy the paper. Of course,
whether most of the 14,000 doctors
in Australia subscribed to it would
depend on quality of reading matter,
The paper could hardly be financed out


of present AMA membership subscrip-
tions because the association’s funds
apparently aren’t adequate to finance
all AMA organisational activities judg-
ing by the lengthy discussion on money
problems during the Fifth Federal
Assembly, including suggestions to raise
membership fees. On the other hand,
drug companies could be relied upon
to provide the bread-and-butter adver-
tising for the paper.
But unless such a journal were firmly
anchored within the medical profession,
doctors could find that more com-
mercially minded interests are calling
the tune.
G. VAN DER TREY
The Muddy Ord
NOTHING stirs Western Australians
quite as much as the Ord question,
and in Perth last week the things
that have long been muttered in semi-
private were said openly in semi-public.
After Mr. Court, Minister for the
North-West, had slammed into the
Commonwealth over its attitude to de-
velopment (for which he sees the Ord
as a shameful symbol), the Liberal and
Country League closed the doors of its
annual conference so that he and Mr.
Paul Hasluck, a fellow Western Aus-
tralian and Minister for External
Affairs, could debate the issue before
the 200 delegates.
Commonwealth and State meet again
this month to discuss whether or not
Federal money should be used to take
the Ord on its second stage; in the past
Mr. Court has pronounced himself ex-
tremely confident at the outcome. “It’s
not a matter of if, it’s a matter of
when,” he has often said. This time he
is being uncharacteristically reticent,
extremely careful not to tread on Can-
berra’s toes as negotiations are renewed.
Despite last week’s differences he is
following the line urged upon fellow
Liberals early this year by the Premier,
Mr. David Brand. Lobby hard for the
Ord, he advocated, but do it behind a
united party front. Mr. Court has been
the most consistent fracturer of this
united front. Soon after the Premier’s
soothing words he taunted that “people
in the Eastern States should be told in
loud and clear terms that it is States
like W.A., with big favorable balances
of overseas income, that are carrying
many Eastern States industries on their
back.” And at last week’s conference,
referring specifically to interference in
overseas iron-ore contracts, he repeated
his claims that the West was booming
despite, not because of, Federal policies.
He spoke also of the Commonwealth’s
indiscriminate use of power, particu-
larly against the West. Few at the meet-
ing could have disagreed with Mr.
Hasluck that “someone else muddied
the waters” of the Ord, not the Com-
monwealth, as Mr. Court has claimed.
For excessive zeal has muddied the
whole of the Ord debate, going right
back to the first criticism of the concept
by Dr. Bruce Davidson and other
agricultural economists; it has always
been a battle of the zealots. Dr. David-
son has spent two years with the
CSIRO working on the economics of
the Ord. When he presented his report
in opposition, he claims, the department
refused to publish it because it failed
to fit in with the policy of the time.
So he quit, did the research again, and
published “The Northern Myth.”
Dr. Davidson’s unusual manner be-
came the butt of cruel criticism of
“academic knockers”; anyone who did
not agree with the Ord scheme. was
inevitably a knocker. But his case that
the Ord money could be spent more
economically elsewhere was so strong
that finally it won majority support.
On the other side of the coin, Mr.
Court started claiming in February that
the cotton-growers of Namoi, N.S.W.,
had engineered opposition to the Ord
for selfish motives. But few took this
seriously until members of the Namoi
Cotton Co-op slipped quietly into Can-
berra to lobby openly at the time that
the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt,
announced the Commonwealth decision
to shelve the Ord problem.
Meanwhile the West’s hopes, built
up by Sir Robert Menzies’ “this is not
the end, this is the beginning” speech
at the official opening, were handed a
stinging rebuff when the first decision
to defer was made (as Mr. Court pointed
out last week) at a time Mr. Brand
was in Canberra; yet the Premier had
to read of this in the papers. This has
been the pattern of the debate with
the loudest talker winning the audience
until it emerged that this did not neces-
sarily mean he had the strongest case.
Now for the first time these pressures
have eased and the coming talks are on
the basis not that the Ord is a hotshot
proposition economically but that it
is a worthwhile national development
despite its acknowledged short-term
economic limitations.
The chances are that in this new
light, with Senators Scott and Branson
and Mr. Dick Cleaver, MHR, pledg-
ing support from the Liberal back-
benches and with an election on the
horizon it will get some degree of
Federal approval.
Getting Out of the Force
NINETY percent of them leave for higher pay, and most of the rest because
they don’t like shift work,” said Inspector Crowley, Secretary of the Police
Association, when THE BULLETIN asked him last week why so many
men were resigning from the Victoria police.
Last year 119 men, including a
sergeant, three senior constables, 28
first constables, and 87 constables,
resigned from the force. These 119
were the bulk of the 206 departures
from active duty: other reasons for
leaving being retirement, ill-health,
death, and dismissal. In 1964, 90 men
resigned, and the year before the figure
was 87.
The problem of police resignations
was dramatised in the individual case
of Constable Farrell, of the City Traffic
Branch, who joined the Victoria police
two years ago after migrating from
Northern Ireland, where he spent 10
years with the Royal Ulster Constabu-
lary. Constable Farrell has resigned for
financial reasons. “A constable’s salary
is all right for fellows with no respon-
sibilities,” he said last week, “but on
my present wage my wife and family
are suffering.”
Constable Farrell said that on his
take-home pay of $45 he had not been
able to install adequate heating in his
house, could not buy his wife a washing-
machine, and could not properly dress
his children. He said that his only
luxury was a small TV set and that in
the past two years he had been able
twice to take out his wife and four
children. “Apparently my 10 years’
police experience in Ireland means
nothing here. I had to leave my wife
while I went through basic training and
a probation period. Since then it’s been
one battle after another to keep on our
feet. I like the police force. It’s the
only life I know, but conditions have
forced me out.”
With resignations increasing each
month, and morale flagging two
recent blows were the allegations of
police informer “Mr. X” and severe
criticism of methods of police interroga-
tion by Mr. Justice Sholl the wage
statistics of the force are worth com-
ment:
• In 1954-55 the Victorian average
annual male wage was £9lB, whilst the
annual salary of a constable was £976.
• By 1960-61, when the Victorian
average annual male wage was £1226,
the annual salary of a constable was
£ll6B.
• In 1964-65, when the average annual
ihale wage was £1607, a constable’s
salary was £1314.
Thus, ten years ago a constable’s
salary was 6.3 percent above the average
annual State wage, in 1961 it was 4.7
percent below, and by 1965 the con-
stable’s salary had slumped propor-
tionately to a position 11.4 percent
under the average male wage. In the
December quarter of 1965, on the
figures available, the constable’s wage
dropped to 17.8 percent under the rest,
which means that the relative decline
in earnings over 10 years is nearly 25
percent.
The average annual State wage in-
eludes overtime, of course, and the
police wage does not, and here lies
part of the problem: the police are


practically unable to increase their earn-
ings through overtime. (During the past
13 years only six members of the Vic-
tona police were paid overtime and in
each case the payment was preceded by
hot and long negotiations.)
At present, with the relative value
of police salaries falling and with over-
time not available, the police force
has become something of a training
school for future corporals and sergeants
of private industry. The weight of this
charge is established by measuring the
245 appointments to the force last
year against the 119 resignations. The
standard of entry to the Victoria police
is higher than in most other States,
significantly higher than in New South
Wales and the training police receive
in their first couple of years is surpris-
ingly comprehensive.
The result is that after a few years
in the force' the average constable, in
terms of civic knowledge, administra-
tive routines, self-confidence, and
leadership qualities, is often a man of
obvious potential value to private em-
ployers. His contacts in the force are,
of course, an added attraction. In a
State with a very lovv rate of unem-
ployment there is a steady demand for
such men as the police training school
is producing every five months or so,
and private industry is always ready
to raise the stakes above what most
public service organisations are likely
to bid The financial issue which the
State Government should consider is
that it costs something like $4OOO to
train a policeman, and if they are going
to resign at the rate of 120 a year, the
annual loss to the State is nearly
$500,000. In view of that loss the pay-
ment of overtime to police, or the
raising of salaries, could even save
something for the Treasury in the long
run if it had the effect of slackening
the rate of resignations.
j A S well as the questions of economics,
j s possible that behind the rising
rate of departure there is a decline in
morale caused not bv the criticisms of
Sriegafprofession Lt by "he imper-
son al destroyer of civilisation, the
motor car.
Before the days of the internal com-
bustion engine most police work was
concerned with a small law-breaking
percentage of the population. The only
contact the policeman had with most
citizens was to come to their rescue
in one way or another. Now, however,
most of the offenders dealt with by
police are motorists, men and women,
who in all or most other ways would
never have any notions of committing
an offence.

o{ the innocent as the persecutor of
the general public, each of whom, on
current figures, can expect to be
prosecuted under the laws of the traffic
code once every four or five years,
The motor car has consequently
severely bruised the police “image”
and may be the hidden cause of the
persistent police discussion of their
alleged falling morale. Certainly the
police themselves seem to believe it is
falling.
The “Police Journal” of Victoria
sent out questionnaires recently about
the morale of the force. Of the 1023
replies, 920 said morale was 1 below
standard,” 80 said it was “satisfactory,”
and 23 said it was “good.”
Last weekend after the resignation of
eight more police—three of them detec-
tives the Chief Commissioner of
Police, Mr. R. H. Arnold, announced
that his Department would soon start
allocating housing loans to policemen
in an attempt to halt the resignations.
And to help tackle the morale problem
he also announced the appointment of
a Police Welfare Officer,

THE WAR
An Interview with Hoang Van Chi
By PETER SAMUEL
Q.: Is this regarded as a racial war,
Europeans against Asian peoples?
A.: No. The Vietnamese have no
anti-European feelings. They have many
oppressors and some of these were
Asian Chinese. Anyway, under
French rule it was the native mandarins
supported by the French and not the
French themselves whom the people
hated.
Q.: Why is the terror experienced
by the people of the North not a more
powerful factor in rallying popular sup-
port for the anti-Communist struggle
in the South? After all a million
refugees are said to have trekked south.
A.: But these people did not them-
selves experience the terror. They came
from the French-controlled areas north
of the 17th parallel and only learnt of
the terror through stories and news-
papers. Only a few thousand who lived
in Communist-controlled areas managed
to get out.
Q.: But has it not been possible for
the Saigon Government to put across
the facts?
A.: They have tried but not suc-
ceeded. Because those who prepared the
propaganda did not experience the
terror, they made mistakes and exag-
gerations and the story did not ring
true. Most of all, they have failed to
explain why there was terror and that
it was not just landlords and collabora-
tors who suffered, but ordinary people.
Q.: Is poverty a major factor causing
dissatisfaction and providing a basis
for Communist support?
A.: The Vietnamese people are not
desperately poor and the natural
distribution of wealth is not grossly
inequitable. It is more frustration at
injustice and inefficiency in administra-
tion.
Q-: How do you explain the acute
governmental instability in Saigon?
A.: Unfortunately the elite is still
French-oriented and has little in com-
mon with the peasants, so there is
plenty of dissatisfaction. For many
years freedoms have been lacking and
so those who oppose the Government
are inexperienced in democratic poli-
tics and they resort to violence.
Essentially, there are two schools of
thought in South Vietnamese politics:
Those who have full confidence in the
success of the war against the Com-
munists and are prepared to wait until
then to create the good society and
those who think that this cannot await
victory. The latter remember that the
French precipitately withdrew and
with Fulbright and Bobby Kennedy
preaching negotiation and withdrawal
they are afraid the Americans may do
the same thing. They are afraid that
a non-viable regime may be left in Sai-
gon to fight alone.
Q" .So the protesters in _ Western
countnes are contributing to instability
* n A^c° n ‘ 1
ertain y. .
Q* : Will the elections later this year
improve the situation?
A.: Yes, because they will give an
opportunity to the very promising
younger generation of educated men
and women who are more nationalist
than their elders But there are major
problems. It will be difficult to get
fair elections because since Diem
started rigging the ballot it has become
a tradition. Moreover, the Communists
have killed off most of the personali-
ties in the countryside over the course
of eight years of terrorism and so it
will be hard to find good candidates.
Worthless people may also be elected
because the Communists will urge their
supporters to vote for bad candidates
to discredit the elections and make the
Constituent Assembly as ineffective as
possible. That was what they did under
Diem.
Q.: Should Neutralists and Com-
munists be allowed to run as candi-
dates?
A.: If I were the Government I
would invite the Communists to par-
ticipate. I am sure that they would
not accept, because they would not be
confident of victory. After all, when
Souvanna Phouma invited them to par-
ticipate in elections in Laos they re-
fused. As for Neutralists, I do not know
how they can be defined.
Q.: How many votes would the
Communists get 20 or 30 percent?
A.: Perhaps, but I doubt it. Anyway,
Hoang Van Chi—Patriot
J)IMINUTIVE, almost delicate in
physique, yet a striking figure, Mr.
Floang Van Chi is the epitome of the
Confucian intellectual: in manner
always reflective, sometimes philosophi-
cal, unfluent yet highly articulate.
Wryly he opened his first Press confer-
ence in Canberra last week observing
that his visit to Australia might be con-
sidered as an exchange: for that of
Hanoi’s Australian propagandist Wilfred
Burchett.
Hoang said his main reason for being
here was that Australia is the one
country in which Vietnam can have full
confidence. As long as Johnson is Presi-
dent of the United States American
troops would remain to help Vietnam,
but the Lippmans, the Kennans, and
the Wayne Morses give the Vietnamese
people doubts about the future. Aus-
tralia, however, by its membership of
the South-east Asian community is
bound, he said, strategically to involve
itself in the defence of the region.
But Mr. Hoang is no propagandist.
His perspective is long. His life has
been a revolutionary one. Born in 1913
in Thanh Hoa province in a village
100 miles south of Hanoi, the marriage
of his parents was arranged by grand-
parents who met as prisoners of the
French in the Poulo Condor islands
off the coast of southern Vietnam. He
developed an interest in the anti-
colonial struggle in primary school,
being required in the evenings to read
French newspapers to his uncle. And at
the age of 13 he was dismissed from
school for organising student demon-
strations against the execution by the
French of the Vietnamese nationalist
patriot Phan Boi Chau. I asked him
how his early attitudes to Commun-
ism were formed: He mentioned
having read Andre Gide’s “Return
From The Soviet Union” while at
high school, but said that he retained
strong sympathies for Marxism as a
philosophy and the Soviet Union as
the model for modernisation until his
involvement in the popular front move-
ment in the late ’3os.
Much of the front’s energy was
wasted in fratricidal strife between
Trotskyites and Communists. Hoang
helped raise money for the movement
newspaper “Le Travail,” squeezing
friends and relatives, only to find the
Communists using the funds for night-
clubbish pleasures. But for any patriot,
the first political priority was the
struggle against the French, and so
Hoang joined the Communists in the
Viet Minh. Toward the end of the
Liberation War, his old friend Pham
Van Dong, now Prime Minister of
the Communist Government, asked him
to be Director of the Mint.
Avoiding politics under Communism,
he concentrated on administration. He
found this impossible when the party
insisted on putting in party members
as deputy-directors “ignorant and
authoritarian, these men caused much
trouble among the workers.” Then, as
a teacher and dairyman he returned
to his village. There, in 1953 and 1954,
he experienced at first hand the bar-
baric madness of Hanoi’s “political
struggle” and “land reform” cam-
paigns which swept the countryside.
He managed to escape completely
the first campaign by inventing


a few Communists in the Parliament
would do no harm. Participation in a
coalition government, however, is an
entirely different matter.
Q.: It is often said in the West that
all the Vietnamese people want after
all these years of war is peace.
A.: Certainly there are some who
want it. But others would not con-
tinue to fight if that was all they
wanted. Many are aware that Com-
munism is a threat to the freedom
they struggled so hard to gain from the
French. For others, it is a matter of
survival, for as long as they fight the
Communists they have a chance of sur-
viving, whereas if the Communists take
over they have no chance of any peace
except the peace of death.
Q.: What do you say to the sugges-
tions that tough resistance to Commun-
ism only makes it more fierce and that
if only we compromised more we could
get a more moderate, Titoist-type of
regime?
A.: That is quite silly. The nature of
the Communist regime depends mostly
on its internal evolution. And as far as
Vietnamese Communists are concerned
it is important to note that they have
always been mentally servile to the
Chinese, following their methods very
closely. The commune is about the only
Chinese technique they have not
emulated. So they are most likely to
follow a Chinese line in foreign policy.
Q.: Would a united Communist Viet-
nam be likely to extend its influence?
A.: Most probably, because we Viet-
namese have traditionally been an im-
perialist people. Before the arrival of
the French we considered Laos and
Cambodia as our possessions.
Q.: What is your reaction to the
bombing of the North?
A.: In a war people on both sides
get killed. I am a Vietnamese and,
naturally, I do not like this, and since
I am a native of North Vietnam I am
most unhappy about the bombing of
the North. But the war is a just one
and I must admit that the bombing
is necessary. The real question is
whether the bombing can be done
accurately so that innocent civilians do
not get killed.
Q.: What about' the bombing of
Hanoi and Haiphong?
A.: The oil installations bombed are
well away from where people live. In
Hanoi they are over a wide river.
Q.: How can the North Vietnamese
be brought to the negotiating table?
A.: Probably only if the regime is
threatened.
Q.: But the Americans have re-
peatedly stated that they have no in-
tention of overthrowing it?
A.: Well, perhaps they should not say
that and leave the North Vietnamese in
some doubt. They must, of course, say
that they have no territorial ambitions,
and say it much more frequently.
Q.: Could a revolt in the North be
encouraged?
A.: It need not be, because the people
are willing to rise up and fight the
Communist regime which they hate.
But they have no opportunity.
Q.: What else needs to be done to
win the war?
A.: It must be waged on both the
military and the political 'fronts. On
the military front more effective pro-
tection must be given to areas captured
from the Viet Cong. Only if there is
security can people resist the Com-
munists, and I am sure that if security
can be improved many Viet Cong
cadres who are very dissatisfied will
defect.
The bombing of the North may help
to discredit the regime in the eyes of
the people. But highest priority should
be given to the political struggle. As
the Chinese strategist of the 3rd cen-
tury, Sun Tzu, said, the first
priority must be to conquer the hearts
of the people. In Saigon a new spirit
is needed so that the police are no more
harsh with the taxi-driver than with
the rich man in the Mercedes. A new
truly national anthem and a national
flag should be part of a drive to rally
the people to the national cause.
Psychological warfare must be stepped
up against the Communists, and it
should be made clear that the Govern-
ment will suppress REAL Com-
munists alone.
Q-: It is often said that the Viet-
namese people do not understand
democracy or elections, and so they are
not important for them.
A.: That is complete nonsense. In
every country people know how to
vote even though some do not under-
stand a political program or a political
party. In that case they vote for a
man they know and trust. That is
simple. Anyway, there have been demo-
cratic elections in Vietnam for a thou-
sand years. Traditionally, the villagers
have voted to elect their village leaders
and on the national scale there were
many elections during the French
occupation. And quite often anti-
French candidates were elected. More
recently there have been provincial
elections. All people want freedom and
democracy.
reasons for leaving the village: “Each
village was so busy dealing with its
own ‘reactionaries’ that strangers were
safe.” During the two weeks, most
deaths were the result of beatings and
Hoang managed to avoid witnessing all
but one: the local storekeeper, sus-
pended by his feet from the rafters of
the village meeting hall, was flogged to
death over a period of twelve hours.
His crime had been to put an un-
authorised exclamation mark on the
placard in his shop: “Welcome, the
trade tax!”
The dozen or so killings of this
campaign were a minor prelude to
the massive “land reform” movement
which systematically swept the
countryside, village by village, wave by
carefully prepared wave. Hoang owned
three acres of land, quite enough to
classify him as a “landlord.” But what
probably saved him was his action two
years earlier of offering his land to
the People’s Liberation Army, this
being regarded as a gesture of his
solidarity with the regime. He had
managed to sell two acres in the mean-
time, but even the ownership of one
acre was dangerous and he was
classified by the party as “category C
landlord.”
“When my turn came it was already
the fifth wave of the campaign, so
fortunately I knew the best way to
get lenient treatment. The accused
and the accuser were equally actors
in a huge play organised by the party
and so there was no sense in not follow-
ing the script. I pleaded guilty to all
the heinous crimes of which I was
accused. I was lucky. They simply
sent me home to live quietly with my
cows.”
Others were not so lucky. Before
Hoang left, about a dozen people were
shot, including his uncle. At these shoot-
ing the people of the village had to
cheer and applaud. Another uncle was
one of many who died in jail. A cousin
suicided after the denunciations; another
cousin’s wife was given an “isolation
sentence.” This meant she and her hus-
band and children were all confined to
their house. Their lands were confis-
cated and they were not allowed to do
business with anyone; so they starved.
The woman, desperately hungry, ven-
tured out at night to thieve food from
a market stall and was caught and tried.
She died from beatings.
Gaining freedom of movement by
being a trader, Hoang was able to get
to Hanoi. Changing his name again
and buying a false identity card he got
to Haiphong, and then by ship to
Saigon, where he lived as a freelance
journalist until 1959. Then he moved
to Paris because of the curtailment of
freedom of the Press under Diem.

Indonesia’s New Politics
Sukarno and Nasution-the “Great Revolution” is over.
By DONALD KIRK
NOW that President Sukarno has
been stripped of most of his
power, his critics are beginning
to appreciate one of his finer achieve-
ments. For 20 years the Bung in the
name of the “Great Revolution” and a
host of other slogans was able to force,
buy, export, cajole, browbeat, and
otherwise mould his people into a uni-
fied nation. That unity was put to
the test on numerous occasions by
Islamic Nationalists, by Communists, by
military leaders, by foreign govern-
ments. Somehow Sukarno managed to
weather all these crises despite the
efforts of many of his enemies, includ-
ing the United States, which com-
mitted the serious blunder of giving
armed support to the rebels in Sumatra
and the Celebes in the late 19505.
It is little wonder then that Sukarno,
having had the last laugh so often,
grew overconfident, perhaps arrogant,
in his later years. “I am the Great
Leader of Revolution” was a theme
that ran through many of his speeches,
and, indeed, he was. Like many
“great leaders,” both real and imagined,
he was also human. He was so cock-
sure of the neat balance he had struck
between the Communists, the Armed
Forces, and the Moslems that he
scarcely believed one of these integral
elements could totally defeat the other.
The abortive coup d’etat of last
October 1 wildly tipped the scales that
had both united Indonesia and held
Sukarno in power. The aftermath of
the coup, in which the Communists
were thoroughly crushed by both the
Moslems and the Armed Forces, also
shattered some of the pet policies that,
he had developed to unite the people
around common themes. Gone, for all
practical purposes, is “confrontation”
against Malaysia, the “enemy” that all
Indonesians had vowed to “crush.”
Gone is the fanatic insistence on Marx-
ism, a line that Sukarno propounded
partly to arouse national sentiment
against foreign holdings and expropri-
ate them for the Indonesian Govern-
ment. Gone, perhaps, is the deeply anti-
Western emotionalism, a vestige of the
struggle against Dutch colonialism, that
Sukarno had promoted to whip the
country into a frenzy of hatred
and blind support for his policies.
Western diplomats and correspon-
dents have not hesitated to express
their delight with these developments.
They have shown somewhat less con-
cern with the danger that now threatens
Indonesia that of hopeless fragmen-
tation and quarrelling among political,
religious, regional, and ethnic groups.
This danger was vividly impressed on
me one night when I heard the crackle
of automatic gunfire five floors below
my room in the Press House.
A mob of some 500 teenagers was
trying to overrun 20 soldiers guarding
the entrance and break up a congress
of the Action Command of Indonesian
High School Students (KAPPI) in the
Press House lounge.
The intruders, it turned out, were
members of the Indonesian Islamic
Association, a nation-wide high-school
group once affiliated with Masjumi,
a major Moslem party outlawed by
Sukarno six years ago for opposing his
concept of Guided Democracy. KAPPI
had expelled the Masjumi students for
trying to dominate the congress, which*
in fact, was dominated by members of
the Moslem Scholars party, allied with
students from the small but influential
Christian and Catholic parties.
The incident might have been minor
but wasn’t quite. The soldiers, joined
by Indonesian Marines, lowered their
sights into the crowd when it threatened
to run out of control. Two students
were killed and seven wounded. The
next day the Indonesian Islamic
Association gave one of the victims
a hero’s funeral and burial in a grave
beside that of Arif Rachman Hakim,
the student whose death in riots out-
side the President’s palace last winter
had made him a national hero. The
fighting among high-school • students
clearly symbolised a much deeper,
more serious split among Moslems —-

the “traditional” Moslem Scholars
against the “modern,” more sophisti-
cated Masjumi.
The irony of the division is that
Indonesia’s Moslems, 90 percent of the
nation’s 106 million population, ap-
peared to have united in their cam-
paign against the Communists after
the coup. Now, former Masjumi mem-
bers are saying that some of the
Moslem Scholars’ supposedly anti-
Communist leaders are “stooges” of
Dr. Subandrio, the Foreign Minister
who was jailed on pro-Communist
charges in March. The insult cuts
deep, since Subandrio has become the
scapegoat for all the wrongs of the
Central Government in the years before
Sukarno was forced to transfer much
of his authority to General Suharto,
Deputy Prime Minister for Defence.
Newspapers often refer to Subandrio
as “Durno” an evil priest in a
Javanese shadow play who gave bad
advice to a king.
The New Moslems
'JHE Moslem Scholars, in turn, say
that former Masjumi members are
“anti-Sukarno” and against the State
philosophy of Pantjasila the five
principles of belief in God, democracy,
humanism, social justice, and national-
ism. Moslem Scholars, who a month
or two ago seemed willing to have
Sukarno eased out of office, want him
to remain as a figurehead president
at least until elections for a new
Peoples Consultative Congress, which
has the constitutional power to
choose a president and vice-president.
They fear that another leader might
be inclined to legalise both the Mas-
jumi and the Indonesian Socialist
Party, which Sukarno also outlawed
six years ago.
The Moslem Scholars themselves are
split between those following their
chairman, Dr. Idham Chalid, who won
Sukarno’s favor by appeasing the Com-
munists, and some of their younger
leaders, who have had the chance to
promote an anti-Communist line since
the coup. But they have temporarily
closed the split to meet the threat of
another large and popular Moslem
party. Their common enemy now is
Mohammed Hatta, who resigned as
Vice-President in 1957 in protest against
Sukarno’s increasingly dictatorial
powers. Since the middle of March
Hatta has made a number of speeches
and statements clearly indicating his
interest in serious consideration as
Sukarno’s successor.
Hatta’s line in general has been to
assail Sukarno’s old slogans, including
such articles of faith as the “Great
Revolution” and Nasakom national-
ism, religion, and Communism, an
attempt at blending the nation’s diffuse,
often antagonistic drives. Instead, Hatta
has suggested that Indonesia concen-
trate on the practical problems of
improving its dilapidated economy and
restoring international prestige. What
alarming to the Scholars, how-
ever, is his declared willingness to lead
“a new Moslem party.” This party
would draw most of its members from
the old Masjumi, including some who
later joined the Moslem Scholars for
want of anywhere else to go.
Young Moslem Scholars have en-
gaged in some questionable tactics to
suppress Hatta’s influence. One of their
members was deputised to telephone
Hatta and tell him that a speaking
engagement had been cancelled. The
audience waited for an hour or so
before Hatta’s backers went to his
home and brought him to the hall amid
cheers and boos. Hatta has also been
attacked in anonymous pamphlets put
out with the secret support of the Mos-
lem Scholars. While these efforts have
added an air of controversy to Hatta’s
campaign, they have not succeeded in
suppressing it.
If anything, Hatta has become the
choice not only of modern Moslems
but also of Indonesia’s “liberal”
Socialists members of the old
Socialist Party. Former Socialist fol-
lowers might prefer to reorganise their
own party, but they thoroughly approve
of Hatta’s systematic debunking of
Sukarno’s ideas. They would probably
unite with Masjumi in an election if
they did not have popular candidates
of their own.
One factor hindering both Masjumi
and the Socialists is that a number
of their best-known leaders have just
been freed after several years in prison
or are still awaiting their release.
Sukarno jailed most of them without
trial either for supporting the “Colonel’s
Revolt” of eight years ago or for
leading political opposition to Guided
Democracy.
The question of whether to legalise
Masjumi and the Socialist Party has
created another split, this one in the
military establishment. General Suhar-
to is believed to oppose the presence
of a new political party. He points out
that Indonesia already has two major
parties the Moslem Scholars and
the Nationalist Party, the latter still
suffering from serious division between
its moderate leaders and Left-wing
rebels as well as half a dozen minor
parties. He is said to fear that two
more important parties would create
hopeless political wrangling at a time
when Indonesia, above all else, needs
political stability.
General Suharto also has appeared
reluctant to encourage the revival of
parties whose old leaders were involved
in rebellion against the Government,
even though he may sympathise with
their motives for rebelling. Right-wing
military officers, who basically would
prefer a military-controlled Indonesia
with two or three parties at most, sub-
scribe to this point of view, too. One
general who does not is Abdul Haris
Nasution, dismissed by Sukarno as
Defence Minister in February. Nasution,
given the relatively minor job of
Deputy Supreme Commander of the
Crush Malaysia Command in March,
has said he would “welcome a new
Moslem party.” Like Hatta, Nasution

has made a number of speeches in
recent weeks urging Indonesians to re-
consider Sukarno’s ideas and indicat-
ing his desire to return to a high posi-
tion in the Central Government.
The major theme of Nasution’s
speeches is the necessity for enforcing
the 1945 Constitution, which gives the
People’s Consultative Congress ultimate
authority in governing the country.
Nasution, on speaking tours in Sumatra
and Central Java, has repeatedly
blamed the rise of Communism in
Indonesia before the coup on “de-
viations from the Constitution.”
Once criticised by student leaders
for lacking the nerve to oppose Sukarno,
Nasution appears to have reversed his
attitude since April. He has defended
the right of students to stage mass
demonstrations demanding a return to
the Constitution, while Suharto has
indicated he now regards the student
protests as embarrassing. Suharto post-
poned a session of Congress from the
middle of May to late June and still
fears it may “lead to national dis-
aster.”
Even if Congress actually exercised
its power to vote Sukarno entirely out
of office, Suharto would be far from
satisfied. The field would then be open
not only to feuding among legitimate
political parties and other anti-
Communist groups but also to height-
ened activity by Communist sympath-
isers. Suharto, possibly trying to dis-
tract student attention from their cam-
paign for the Constitution, has warned
that Communists are “consolidating
their strength” underground. He claims
they have infiltrated legal political
organisations and inspired competition
between anti-Communist factions.
It is a fact, as Suharto is painfully
aware, that Sukarno still has tremen-
dous support in Central Java, home of
40 million people. The leaders of the
Left-wing faction of the Indonesian
Nationalist Party have fled there and
inspired a series of fights between
pro- and anti-Communist groups. I
witnessed a rally in Jogjakarta in which
Nationalist students threw rocks at
another group of students who had
participated in the purge of Commun-
ists in November and December.
The anti-Communist students shouted
“Peking dogs” at the Nationalists, who
said they were only defending “the
honor of Bung Karno.” Nationalist
students admitted they also sympathised
with Dr. Subandrio, whom they praised
for his “anti-imperialist” policies.
Forcing Sukarno to resign could make
him all the more heroic a figure in the
eyes of his Left-wing backers, including
a number of military officers who sym-
pathise with neither Suharto nor
Nasution. Suharto recently relieved
the commanding generals of both
the West and Central Java military
districts and reinstated the West Java
commander after he signed a declara-
tion pledging his personal loyalty. Both
these generals, as well as a number
of their troops, may well want Sukarno
to remain as President. Despite his
powerful position, Suharto has found
it difficult to purge the ranks of units
far removed from the military establish-
ment in Djakarta.
Civil War
'PHE ultimate danger in Indonesia is
civil war not a one-sided “purge”
such as that last fall in which as
many as 300,000 Communists may have
been slaughtered, but a real war that
divides the country geographically and
pits armies against each other. It is
not entirely impossible that parts of
the Indonesian Army could ally with
the Leftists in defence of Sukarno. Nor
is it impossible that Moslem politicians
who otherwise abhor the Communists
could be hopelessly divided by internal
fighting, differences of point of view
over religion, struggles between Mas-
jumi and Moslem Scholar elements.
Then there is always the danger of
secessionist movements in the outer
islands, particularly Sumatra, Borneo,
and the Celebes, whose people have
long resented Javanese domination.
These are some of the difficulties
confronting Indonesia. In the past only
Sukarno, among all of Indonesia’s real
and potential leaders, could exercise
the kind of magic that was needed to
surmount such problems. The question
now is whether Indonesia’s present
leaders can also develop a formula for
unity or whether some new leader
will emerge with Sukarno’s magnetic
appeal for all Indonesians. Suharto and
his allies would like the President to
remain in office as a symbol of national
unity until they find a solution. They
know that Sukarno, for all his faults, at
least held the country together, and it
is not at all certain that they can do
the same.

The Publisher's Business
By MICHAEL BAUME
George Ferguson
Angus and Robertson

Dr. A. Fabinyi
F. W. Cheshire
Revolutionary change has
become almost a way of life in
book publishing in Australia. The
swing into paperbacks, the basic altera-
tions to the industry’s structure through
takeovers, and the increasing activities
of foreign publishers here have given
the industry two years of turmoil —and
more changes are sure to follow.
The powerful new groupings that
have emerged through mergers, take-
overs, and foreign invasions are chang-
ing the old order, not simply because
they are doing things differently but
because their competition is directed in
the main at the more profitable educa-
tional books sector which makes up 60
percent of the business. Profits from
education have effectively subsidised
much of Australia’s general publishing
since the war.
But there seem genuine fears that the
changed ownership patterns will result
in everything being subordinated to
profits. Publishing has responsibilities, it
is argued, that are wider than the profit
motive, and publishers must deliberately
take unrewarding risks by publishing
important books that probably will not
bring in profits. There is no doubt that
profits are now more important than in
other days; there are very few family
firms left in the business which are not
accountable to public shareholders and
accountants and profit and loss state-
ments.
A big British newspaper group owns
one major British publishing house here;
an even bigger group half-owns three
of Australia’s main publishers; two
Australian newspaper groups have
stakes in books; printing companies
have big publishing holdings; a few of
the big British companies here have
their shares listed on British stock ex-
changes; another significant British
publisher is simply a small part of a
huge UK investment group, and Aus-
tralia’s oldest and most “Australian”
publishing house is 25 percent owned by
a British publisher.
The facts of the change are incon-
testable. Late in 1964, Cecil King’s
International Publishing Company (the
London “Daily Mirror” group) joined
with the Melbourne printing company
Wilke in taking over F. W. Cheshire
for $1.7 million, and they formed a joint
venture called Publishing Associates,
which included Cheshires, Lansdowne
Press (previously bought by Cheshire’s),
and Jacaranda Press (which Wilke had
acquired). And then, last year, Horwitz
bought Ure Smith.
Over the same period there has been
a substantial increase in the publishing
interests in Australia (mainly in the
educational field) of British publishers
who had been here for years, culmin-
ating in this month’s announcement by
Macmillan’s that it would turn its Aus-
tralian branch into a public company
and increase its local publishing opera-
tions (presumably with a heavy con-
centration on educational books). Per-
gamon Press, large in the educational
business in Britain, recently acquired
interests here through their acquisition
of part of the George Newnes opera-
tions of Odhams.
At primary and secondary levels
practically all the textbooks are of
Australian origin, and that is where the
local and British publishers are con-
centrating, while the Americans con-
centrate more on the tertiary level in
which 90 percent of the textbooks are
imported.
But in the educational field the U.S.
publishers here are setting out after
locally written material for local con-
sumption, and McGraw Hill have
already issued such a book. It seems
only a matter of time before others
like Colliers-Macmillan, who at present
have a large distribution and merchan-
dising operation here, will do Aus-
tralian publishing. And even the New
Zealanders, who have long had an
educational book company here —■
Whitcombe and Tombs added
another company, A. H. & A. W. Reed
Pty. Ltd., to the publishing business in
Australia.
Probably the main reason for much
of the highly publicised activity by
British publishers like Penguin and
Macmillan in forming Australian pub-
lishing companies is simply the recent
tax changes in Britain; it now appears
to be a better taxation proposition to
have a local public company out here
than a branch of the U.K. parent. There

seems no reason why Macmillan’s, for
example, would need an Australian
company, rather than simply a branch,
merely because it intends to follow its
stated objective of increasing its in-
terests in local book publishing.
There is little doubt that the Cecil
King-Wilke takeover of the Cheshire,
Lansdowne and Jacaranda publishing
companies is bringing changes in their
publishing approach as well as their
structure. There seems to be a trend
towards Lansdowne (which has no role
in education) taking over the general
publishing operations of the group,
while the other two companies concen-
trate more on educational activities
which already make up more than
three-quarters of their work. There have
also been some joint publishing ventures
within the group.
The IPC group may find the Aus-
tralian publishing field attractive not
only because of its inherent profit
potential, but also because an efficient
Australian administrative and distribut-
ing organisation would be of great
benefit to IPC in improving the large
Australian sales of its substantial
British publishing subsidiaries. These
include Odhams and Paul Hamlyn,
which are big in children’s books, and
Ginn & Co., which has large educa-
tional interests.
CHESHIRE’S Dr. Andrew Fabinyi
says that takeovers have not inter-
fered with the grass roots independence
exercised within his group and that the
great concentration of power has led to
rationalisation of resources such as
with capital problems, invoicing, pack-
aging, and so on. He sees nothing
serious or significant in the big sounds
from British publishers about their
Australian plans. Most of the big
houses have been here for decades
(Macmillan’s have been in Melbourne
since 1904), and he expects no radical
changes when they become a public
company next year (timed to coincide
with the opening of their new build-
ing). Dr. Fabinyi sees no new take-
overs coming up.
Both a cause and an effect of the
British publishing moves in Australia
is in the fact that the proportion that
imported British books now make up
of total Australian sales has fallen sub-
stantially in recent times as local pub-
lishing has rushed ahead largelv in
the educational field. In Britain tkere
has also been a succession of takeovers
and, according to one of the key
figures in this activity, Mr. Robert
Maxwell, of Pergamon Press, the
British trend is towards even greater
vertical integration.
In a recent speech in London, Mr.
Maxwell said that the round of hori-
zontal mergers, as publishers in dif-
ferent areas combined to form larger
firms, would be followed by another
round of vertical mergers. These would
dwarf the previous moves and would
find a great many booksellers eventu-
ally linked with publishers.
Much of the Australian book pub-
lishing industry is highly integrated,
ranging from printing to retailing in

many instances. The recently formed
Sun Books Pty. Ltd., the paperback
publishing house started by two former
Penguin men, Brian Stonier and Geof-
frey Dutton, is now the only sizable
publisher not integrated at least part of
the way into associated functions.
As a Current Affairs Bulletin pub-
lished in. February on the book trade
pointed out, all the big Australian pub-
lishers have bookshops—and presumably
they try to channel a large proportion
of their big orders through these outlets
rather than simply leaving the mer-
chandising entirely to other booksellers.
This is particularly important in the
educational field, where large orders
can be won from the whole school sys-
tem in some States or from many big
schools in others if the publisher is suc-
cessful in convincing the authorities
that the book should be a compulsory
text.
Most of the old-established local pub-
lishers are also associated with, or
owners of, printing companies. The
Halstead Press, one of Australia’s big-
gest, is a subsidiary of Angus and
Robertson; the Cheshire-Lansdowne-
Jacaranda group is half-owned by Wilke
S. Ure-Smith
Ure Smith Ltd.
and Co., the large Melbourne printer;
the Griffin Press, a subsidiary of the
“Advertiser” newspaper (part of the
Melbourne “Herald” group) has an in-
terest in Rigby Ltd., the Adelaide pub-
lishing house, and the William Brooks
printing business publishes some school
books (along with the Sydney telephone
directory).
:r pHE controversial question of the rela-
tion of publishers with retailers and
profit margins was canvassed in the
February CAB—and the views it ex-
pressed were strongly attacked by mem-
bers of the trade. However, in a British
book recently put out in Australia by
Cheshires, “Book Publishing Practice,”
Mr. Clive Bingley describes the politi-
cal conduct of the trade in this area as.
“extremely delicate and frequently dis-
honest.” “The publisher pays lip service
to exclusivity of distribution for book-
sellers, while at the same time encourag-
ing unofficially extra-trade interest in
his publications.”
In Australia the book trade has main-
tained a great solidarity against the
possibility of either price-cutting or
spreading book sales into other than
bookshops. A recent gallant attempt to
buck the system by a new Sydney pub-
lisher who put his gaily colored, well-
presented Readabout children’s books
into chain stores at chain store prices
(only' possible because of very fine
profit margins and very big print runs)
has failed. To what extent this failure
was because he simply could not get
sufficient volume turnover in his chosen
market and to what extent it repre-
sented on effective blackball is not clear.
IMPART from questions of the Restric-
tive Trade Practices Act, there is a
prospect that some of the practices of
the book trade here may well be chal-
lenged by the big British commercial
enterprises which now control such a
large proportion of the Australian book
trade. With a greater need to show
good profits from their operations, these
big publishers may well be in a strong
enough position to dictate the state of
play to the booksellers —and differential
pricing may be not far off.
Already there are indications that one
British-influenced group of Australian
L. O’Neil
Lansdowne Press
S. Horvitz
Horwitz Publications
publishing companies has established a
differential wholesaling rate to retailers
by introducing only this month a 36
percent discount to “volume” buyers,
compared to a 33 l-3rd percent discount
to smaller booksellers in non-educational
books, and giving the volume men a 33
l-3rd percent cut on educational books
compared with only 25 percent to the
smaller shops. But so far there have
been no moves to pass on those differ-
ences to customers, as the bigger shops
argue that it costs them more to sell
books (through having to carry large
stocks) than the smaller.
So things are changing in the book
trade. All these pressures are clearly
making the publishing business more
competitive, at least in the more profit-
able area of educational books. And to
the extent to which this increased com-
petition could limit the scope for educa-
tional book publishing to subsidise the
literary activities of many local publish-
ing companies, then there is ah ironic
danger that increasing publishing opera-
tions in Australia could bring reduced
opportunities for marginally profitable
literary books to find a publisher.


Parliament v. Courts?
The Rent War in N.S.W.
By PETER CLYNE, LL.B.
THE rent war, briefly outlined in a
previous article (“A Landlord’s
Lament,” 8., May 7, 1966), may
escalate to a point where the sover-
eignty of the N.S.W. Parliament could
be called into question.
On June 16, 1966, the Court of
Appeal held that in fixing the fair rent
of premises the Board charged with this
duty can take into account the pur-
chasing power of the dollar, and
changes in the economic picture since
1939, when rents were originally pegged.
(Rathbome v. Hamill). Following
this decision, hundreds of landlords are
applying for rent increases, and the rent
of a semi-detached cottage at Stanmore
was promptly increased from $7.30 wk.
to $ll.lO wk. (Mastro v. Morgan
July 1, 1986). No one was surprised by
the ensuing storm, since for the third
time now the,N.S.W. Government finds
itself unable to keep its promise that
until the next election rent levels are to
be maintained. “I understand and
sympathise with the landlords,” the
Minister of Justice (Mr. J. C. Maddi-
son) is reported to have said. “But the
problem is complex and needs a great
deal of thought and planning. If the
landlords would give us time we might
be able to do this. But nearly once a
month they make a new approach to
get around our policy. And valuable
time is occupied in combating them.”
To which landlords might retort
that since they have been deprived of
a fair rent illegally for over 27 years,
and Mr. Maddison intends to keep
things that way if he can, he should not
feel piqued if on occasions the cloister-
ed fastnesses of his retreat are disturbed
by the screams of a victim.
But another part of his statement
is very much more disturbing. The
report proceeds: “Mr. Maddison warn-
ed landlords yesterday that any in-
creases awarded before he could
introduce legislation in Parliament
would have to be returned to the ten-
ants. Legislation will be retrospective
to the date of the Court of Appeal’s
judgment.”
In other words, Parliament will
quash the Court of Appeal’s decision.
And if a Fair Rent Court follows the
Court of Appeal’s ruling, as it is
bound to do, its decision will be
quashed, too. Naturally, landlords’
organisations immediately announced
that such legislation would be chal-
lenged, and their challenge will raise
political and constitutional issues
which are of far more transcending
importance than the pros and cons of
rent control.
No Australian Government has ever
attempted to interfere with the judicial
process as clearly and as flagrantly as
the N.S.W. Parliament now intends to
do. It is thought to be basic to our
constitutional system and to our legal
order than the Courts are completely
independent of Parliament. Parliament
makes the laws. The Courts interpret
and apply them. If Parliament can then
interfere with the way its laws are in-
terpreted and applied by the Courts,
the Courts cease to be independent.
An attempt to do something like
this was made by a previous N.S.W.
Government. The High Court held
that current capital values should be
taken into account when a rent was
being fixed. An executive order was
made to repeal this decision, and this
stated that current values were NOT
to be taken into account. But this
order was successfully challenged and
held to be invalid (Clyne v. Cardiff,
1965 N.S.W.R. 469).
This, however, was subordinate
legislation, carried into effect by the
Governor of N.S.W. and not by Par-
liament. “It was an attempt to modify
Part II of the Act by insisting upon its
being read according to one interpreta-
tion, namely, one which compelled the
view that any increase in value should
be excluded from consideration. This
would have the effect of amending the
Act so as to give its provisions a con-
struction inconsistent with that laid
down by the High Court of Australia.
An order having this effect is, I believe,
ultra vires the enabling power . . .”
Remember Ceylon
words, used by the Chief Jus-
tice of N.S.W. (Sir Leslie Herron)
in deciding Clyne v. Cardiff, shows how
the Court can protect itself against
interference by the executive, by plac-
ing a limited construction on the Act
of Parliament under which the execu-
tive purports to be acting.
What Mr. Maddison now fore-
shadows strikes much more deeply. For
on this occasion it is Parliament, and
not some arm of the executive, that will
be used to strike down judicial deci-
sions. “The Legislature of N.S.W. is
a sovereign Legislature and has the
power to do this,” Mr. Maddison is
reported to have said. But is he right?
Oddly enough, a very similar prob-
lem came before the Privy Council
only two months ago, when the
Government of Ceylon was held NOT
to have the powers which Mr. Maddi-
son believes can be exercised by the
Government of N.S.W. Ceylon is, of
course, as “sovereign” as the State of
N.S.W.
What happened in Ceylon was that
on the 27th January, 1962, a coup
d’etat occurred, and a number of men
were arrested. The Government felt un-
certain as to whether they had been
lawfully arrested, and as to whether
it was possible to ensure their con-
viction.
So a Criminal Law (Special Pro-
visions) Act was passed which dealt
ONLY with crimes allegedly committed
on the 27th January, 1962. This Act
altered the definition of the relevant
crimes. It provided that the men’s
arrest was lawful. It increased the
penalties for their crime. It altered the
laws of evidence so as to make con-
viction easier. And it took away trial
by jury and enacted that the men were
to be tried by a panel of judges.
The accused persons challenged this
law as being an improper interference
with the power of the Courts, and the
Privy Council upheld their challenge.
It described the statute as. “a legisla-
tive plan ex post facto to secure the
conviction and enhance the punishment
of particular individuals.” The judg-
ment then proceeds: “Legislation ad
hominem, which is thus directed to the
course of particular proceedings, may
not always amount to an interference
with the functions of the judiciary. But
in the present case their Lordships have
no doubt that there was such inter-
ference; that it was not only the likely
but the intended effect of the impugned
enactments; and that it was fatal to
their validity.” Liyanage v. The
Queen (1966, 2 W.L.R. 682).
Obviously Mr. Maddison is following
in the footsteps of the Ceylon Govern-
ment. Even if the groans of landlords
allowed him to go on thinking and plan-
ning, the Privy Council’s words might
add to his distractions. For N.S.W., like
Ceylon, is a sovereign State whose Par-
liament can APPARENTLY do what-
ever it pleases. The Privy Council is
our highest Court of Appeal, just as
it is for Ceylon, and it will presumably
apply the same principles. And Mr.
Maddison proposes to interfere with
particular judgments and particular
proceedings, just as the Ceylon Act had
attempted to do.
What, then, can enable Mr. Maddi-
son’s proposal to survive challenge?
Only this: he may be able to persuade
the Privy Council that the division-of-
power principle is no part of the N.S.W.
constitution; that the independence
from parliamentary interference which
British Courts won after a long and
bitter struggle has somehow been lost
in N.S.W. If this finding is the only
way to victory, does Mr. Maddison
really want to win?
Certainly there is doubt about this.
The Australian Law Journal, comment-
ing in a recent editorial on the Liyanage
decision, says that “the decision invites
attention to the possibility that a strict
separation might be found in other
former British colonies, including our
own States, some of which have con-
stitutional histories and existing con-
stitutions not unlike those of Ceylon.”
(31st May, 1966.)
But, the learned editors go on, “so
far as our own constitutions are con-
cerned, it is notable that their Lord-
ships sought to emphasise that they were
simply interpreting the written Ceylon

constitution, and there are some simil-
arities between it and some of the con-
stitutions of the Australian States. How-
ever, none of these seems as consistent
with a complete separation of powers as
does the constitution of Ceylon.”
Then again, it may be argued that
N.S.W. has a written constitution which
enables the Government to legislate “for
the peace, order, and good govern-
ment” of the people of N.S.W. Just as
an executive order was struck down
in Clyne v. Cardiff because it went
beyond the powers of its parent act, so
Mr. Maddison’s Act of Parliament may
be struck down because it strays beyond
the frontiers of the N.S.W. constitution.
It is even possible, as one of the land-
lords’ organisations pointed out, that
the whole Landlord & Tenant Act
could be destroyed in this way, in which
case Mr. Maddison will have cured
the headache by killing the patient.
What seems clear beyond doubt is
this: that the proposed legislation will
be challenged, and that it will give birth
to a constitutional earthquake for which
there is no precedent in N.S.W. The
ultimate result must be either—
1. A finding that Parliament is NOT,
as Mr. Maddison supposes it to be, a
truly sovereign body, and that there are
limits to its power; or
2. A decision that our Courts are
NOT, as most of us hope they are,
truly independent, and that Parliament
can cancel out their decisions and over-
rule their judgments whenever it dis-
agrees with them. This would mean the
end of the rule of law as most of us
understand it.
The morality of what the Govern-
ment proposes to do is itself a problem
of some magnitude. It is clearly con-
scious of the fact that to legislate is
to perpetuate an injustice. Not to legis-
late, on the other hand, would be inter-
preted by many people as a breach of
its promise to keep rents down.
But if the analysis attempted in this
article is correct, the proposed legisla-
tion is open to a much more profound
criticism:
After all, the sovereignty of Parlia-
ment and the independence of the
Courts cannot both be preserved with-
out some limitation. Theoretically, they
are inconsistent with each other. Yet
ever since we had a sovereign Parlia-
ment, and a network of Courts, in
N.S.W., we have managed to struggle
along without bringing them into actual
conflict. The measure now proposed
will bring this potential conflict into
the open, and force a decision which
must be that one or the other, either
Parliament or the Judiciary, is relatively
impotent.
Whilst many people respect the
N.S.W. Government for its almost
puritan adherence to an electoral
promise, there are limits beyond which
a responsible Government simply can-
not afford to pay the price. Mr. Maddi-
son will have to decide whether the
constitutional turmoil he is about to
unleash is not too high a price.


ONE MORE
WEEK
The Art Detectives
THE TIGHT little world of inter-
national art collectors and leaders will
shortly be disturbed by the publication
of an unusual catalogue. It will list all
the works of art stolen or illegally
“bought” by the German Nazis in Italy
in World War II, some 700 paintings,
tapestries, ceramics, and pieces of furni-
ture which have been officially missing
for 23 years.
The catalogue will be a bitter little
compilation, with photographs of 200
of the missing works. Under each illus-
tration will be set out the bald facts,
stating when and from where each work
was taken; under some will be printed
in red the word “traced.” Behind that
word lies a world of bitter inter-
governmental and inter-departmental
animosity.
Most of the missing works are now
in the basements of museums in Ger-
many, or in private collections in
Europe or the U.S. Hitler, who wished
to enrich the museums of the Third
Reich, and Goering, who wished to em-
bellish his own collection, ordered these
treasures to be deported from Italy and
the appropriations were carried out with
Germanic thoroughness. A special office
was set up called the Kunstschutz, or art
service, headed by a Professor Langs-
dorf, who, paradoxically, was both an
aesthetic art connoisseur and an SS
Colonel. Under the methodic professor,
the SS cleared several hiding places
where the Italian Government had de-
posited art treasures.
Now, 23 years later, some 3000 of
these missing works are back in Italy.
But according to Professor Siviero,
Director of the Office for the Recovery
of Works of Art, steps being taken by
Italian Government departments, in
particular the Ministry of Education
and the Ministry of Fine Arts, are
totally inadequate. In the undergrowth
of Italian and German bureaucracy
nestle many ex-Fascists and ex-Nazis.
There is a manifest lack of initiative,
and more than a suggestion of cor-
ruption.
A senior official of the Italian Min-
istry of Fine Arts said on Italian tele-
vision recently that only 18 works were
still unrecovered, plus two sculptures
and a drawing. This, he said, was the
justification for reducing the annual
budget of the recovery office from
£17,000 to £6OOO. But leading Italian
art experts are unanimous in insisting
that the real number of missing works
is at least 700, with a total value of
several million pounds sterling. If this
is true a recovery budget of £6OOO is
quite inadequate.
The Recovery Office is situated in
Rome and has a branch in Florence. It
has a staff of 12 people, among them
Italy’s four leading art experts, who
give their services free, and two leading
lawyers. Gathered around it is an un-
usual network of informers, a spider’s
web of over 100 discreet, esoteric anti-
quarians and art dealers in all the art
capitals of the world.
A recent recovery of an Uffizi car-
toon, a Lorenzo di Credi, taken from its
wartime hiding place in a villa in Tus-
cany by a German private soldier, is an
example of how the spider’s web uses
its meshes with effect. The German
soldier was captured by the British. In
exchange for a tin of fish he gave the
cartoon to a British soldier, who gave it
to his German girlfriend, who hung it
in her kitchen. She later sold it to a
village shopkeeper, who sold it to a
German art dealer, who sold it to a rich
collector living in Tangier. The col-
lector sent a photograph to the National
Gallery of London asking for identifi-
cation. The National Gallery informed
the Recovery Office, who told the col-
lector it was a stolen work. The col-
lector munificently returned it.
Recently the Recovery Office heard
through the international art grapevine
of a stolen Titian in a private collec-
tion in Switzerland. A harmless-looking
Italian art professor was sent to peruse
the collection, apparently for the pur-
pose of writing a book on early Flemish
masters, some of which were also in-
cluded in the collection. The savant
peered at the Memlings and did not
forget to scrutinise in passing the
Titian. He returned to Rome and gave
his verdict.
The Recovery Office despatched its
plainclothes policeman, who informed
the collector that he had the choice of
either returning the Titian or facing an
international scandal. The Titian came
quietly back to the Florentine museum.
A Far Cry
CHARLTON HESTON’S career, as we
reported last week, has involved climb-
ing Mt. Sinai on foot; the man to make
him do this was Cecil B. De Mille.
What did he think of De Mille?
“He had a great capacity,” he told
THE BULLETIN, “to deal with masses
of people on the screen: the raising of
the big top in ‘The Greatest Show,’ the
Exodus in the ‘Commandments.’ But
his concept of individual sequences was
—I think it fair to say—old-fashioned.”
And his scripts, Heston agreed, suffered
from the fact that he had been trained
in the silent period.
William Wyler, who had directed
him in “Ben Hur” and “The Big Coun-
try,” he unhesitantly called a great
director, right up there with Lean,
George Stevens, and Welles. “He’s not
at all stimulating or exciting to work
for, like Orson, but he’s a watch-maker.
He’ll take and take a scene, and then
fit the pieces together. Playing for him
is like balancing a milk bottle on tooth-
picks—you’ll do something, and you’ll
do something else, and then you’ll see
the whole performance come together
but not until you see it on the
screen . . .”

tralia, the 11th-century story “The War
Lord,” had been injured by the studio.
It had been intended not as an epic but
as a love story set in the Middle Ages
re-created with unusual fidelity by the
art director, and written by an “accom-
plished medievalist,” John Collier, who
had once written stories for “The New
Yorker.” “The studio said that they
didn’t want an ‘EI Cid.’ But later
on they changed their minds. And we
had a great deal of witchcraft stuff —•
but the head of the studio was a Roman
Catholic, and he got terribly nervous.
He was offended by it, and afraid others
would be, and cut most of it out. And
we had a quite exquisite and, to my
mind, utterly tasteful nude scene —that
was cut, too.”
We mentioned how so many Holly-
wood directors had complained of this
cutting of their films. “Well, the studios
only give the right of final cut to Wyler,
Stevens, a very few others. Usually, they
just let the director show his friends the
cut, then maybe preview it once or twice
.—and after that they cut the picture
themselves. And in a way, I sympathise
with the studios. After all, the picture
is their property. But it makes it very
hard to be an artist in film. United
Artists has a wise policy. They tend
to give directors freedom. And they
have so many different kinds of suc-
cessful pictures because of that.”
He had found less taxing the shooting
of “Touch of Evil,” brilliantly directed
by Orson Welles, and perhaps his best
film. He disclosed the so far unpub-
lished fact that he had been responsible
for Welles being hired to direct the
picture. “ ‘Orson Welles is playing the
heavy,’ ” they told me when they
signed me. “I said, ‘Playing the heavy!
Why don’t you have him direct it?’ So
they did!” He thought that shot by
shot it was a great picture, but that
Welles, a genius, had a mind too fast
for the public to follow, and that was
why the film had been a flop.
A far cry from De Mille, indeed.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Moses and the Monash Red Sea
CHARLTON HESTON is quite
the most charming John the
Baptist, Moses, El Cid, Andrew
Jackson, or Ben-Hur ever to visit
here. There was a sort of beautiful
balance, Harold Holt in the U.S.
while Charlton Heston conducted a
goodwill tour for the State Depart-
ment in Australia.
It is easy to see why he was
chosen for this role, as he was for
all the others. He is such an im-
posing man. In his Gothic features
there is a feeling of everlasting
strength, goodness, and impeccable
honesty. In Melbourne he was met
at the airport by Frank Sedgman.
Frank said that “Chuck” took him
out to dinner in London several
years ago. At that time Heston’s
contract stipulated that he had to
be provided with a Rolls-Royce and
chauffeur. But he became very fed-
up with this over-imposing chariot,
so he bought himself an E-type
Jaguar.
He had owned this Jaguar just
two days when a man went to the
doorman at the Grosvenor and said
in a firm voice: “Would you have
Mr. Heston’s Jaguar brought here
to the front door?”
And that was the last he saw of
his Jaguar for quite some time.
Eventually it turned up at Brighton.
Chuck duly arrived, and im-
mediately exhibition tennis matches
were arranged. Indeed, your corres-
pondent was even lucky enough to
get a go at him at the Albert Ground
courts. He turned out in a U.S.
Davis Cup jacket with matching
Davis Cup socks. He said: Denny
Ralston gave it to me. And he
said that if ever I learned to hit
a forehand volley he’d give me the
U.S. shield to go on the pocket.”
Did he play much with the top
players? “Yes, in the past fortnight
I have played with Laver, Rosewall,
Segura, Buchholz, Santana ... I
guess for a bad player I’ve played
with more good players than any
man alive. You know, the other day
I was playing doubles with Kenny
Rosewall, Pancho Segura, and
Efrem Zimbalist Jnr. Just as we
were changing ends I heard Segura
say to Ken, ‘You know, this is fun.
It’s almost like tennis.’ ”
But Heston has a passion for
tennis. He likes to play it every day.
Particularly when he is dealing with
a complex part he finds that hitting
a white ball eases the tensions. He
only discovered it eight years ago.
“You know,” he said, “at school
you learn all those team sports which
are no use to you whatever. When I
left college I had a broken nose and
a broken arm and 21 fellows who
were no longer around to play foot-
ball with.
On the court, Heston was easily
as imposing as El Cid, 6ft. 3in.,
marvellous narrow hips, far more
impressive than those of Mr. Nick-
laus; and he was very destructive
with his overhead volleys. His serve
was excellent, plenty of spin and
kick. However, he was very slow
around the backline. He would make
perhaps B grade Pennant.
He played an exhibition match at
the Grace Park courts with Frank
Sedgman as a fund-raiser for the
Bethesda Hospital, $2 a head.
They had a marvellous gallery,
mostly of middle-aged matrons.
Sedgman won 6-1, 6-4. Heston, as
ever, was very gallant. “Frank made
a good effort to make me look good,
but he didn’t succeed. In my league,
if you hit the backhand your
opponent doesn’t return it.”
The ladies presented him with a
tennis racquet in a kangaroo hide
cover and he gave a poetry reading.
These have been very much to a
pattern all round Australia. He
puts his audience at ease with the
line: “This is quite a change for
me . . . the last time I was here,
it was as the winner of a fixed
chariot race.” When he reads the
Declaration of Independence he
describes Thomas Jefferson as the
only true genius ever to occupy the
White House. Then he tells the
famous story of the night President
Kennedy entertained a very distin-
guished body of scientists and the
President said: “This is the most
brilliant assembly gathered in this
room since Thomas Jefferson dined
alone.”
The stuff he has given his audien-
ces here has been straight down the
line, warm, uncomplicated. He has
read early anonymous Australian
convict poems. He has read “The
Man from Snowy River,” a poem
about Sydney Harbor by Charles
Higham, Mark Twain’s Journal on
his visit to Australia, some of
Thomas Wolfe and the last chapter
of Moby Dick, when Captain Ahab
meets his fate. Heston tells how he
came from the timber country in
the backwoods of Michigan, how as
a boy his father used to read to
him. That’s how he gained his love
for acting and for reading aloud.
He said that when performing on
a stage one was acting at an
audience, but this way in a reading
he felt there was more direct com-
munication. As a reader he is no
Charles Laughton, no Sir Cedric
Hardwicke, and certainly no Sir
Laurence Olivier, but he has a
powerful Ben-Hurish command of
what he is doing.
His best reading was “Stopping
by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” by
Robert Frost, and here he was
great. He said he read it at the
White House just weeks before
President Kennedy was assassinated
and he read it two days later on
a TV memorial program. This
always wound up the reading:
The woods are lovely, dark and
deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
At Grace Park, Frank Sedgman
said, “The club has never seen so
much culture. What there is is
usually in the bar.” At Monash 1000
students went wild and several girls
fainted. At one stage he found it
impossible to force his way through
the crowd. As someone suggested,
if he was able to part the Red Sea
with such ease, why was he having
a problem here?

A Tricky Night with Randolph
“Tomorrow I will be sniffing roses in Kent.”
By BARRY O. JONES
IT all happened such a long time ago.
Still, it did take place and must
be committed to print before I
am too feeble to recite it with sufficient
passion.
In June, 1958, on my first trip abroad,
I had reaped a fine harvest of political
incidents: being arrested twice by poli-
tical police in East Berlin, watching
street brawls in the most recent of
French Revolutions, listening to pot-
shots on the Israel-Jordan border, ob-
serving Greek meet Turk with bombs
and bullets as Nicosia blazed with
Makarian unrest. I booked for the
7 p.m. Viscount flight from Nicosia to
Beirut, on Middle East Airlines.
Lebanon, my destination, was under
martial law and smouldered with civil
war between Arabs and Christians
specifically over whether President
Camille Chamoun, a Maronite Catholic
and father-in-law of former Sydney
model Patti Morgan, could suspend the
Constitution in order to secure a second
term in office for himself.
Thirty minutes after the scheduled
take-off time, the doors opened again
for the umpteenth time and without
even looking at the passenger entrance
I became aware of a presence —almost
an aura, but more olfactory (“Four
Roses”?) than charismatic. It be-
longed to a pink-flushed man in a
baggy, cream seersucker suit. He lurched
into the seat beside me after grimacing
at the burnous-draped seats ahead. He
was asleep before the hostess had time
to fasten his safety belt. He remained
asleep throughout our 170-mile flight
and it took the combined efforts of
hostess and self to rouse him at the
other end.
No ordinary passenger, he. This was
Randolph Frederick Edward Spencer-
Churchill, MBE, late Captain of the
4th Hussars, briefly MP, 1940-45 (bene-
ficiary of the wartime electoral truce),
veteran of Tito’s war and the Korean
campaign, journalist extraordinary,
pride of the Beaverbrook stable, and
his father’s chosen, or at any rate
appointed, biographer. During our 40-
minute flight I studied his florid head
and fine hands with almost microscopic
care and recalled snatches from pieces
I had read about him. An “Observer”
profile had commented: “No one can
set the adrenalin flowing simply by the
rumor of his approach as Randolph
Churchill can. At the news that he has
arrived at a party, at a Press con-
ference, at a railway station, hearts
pump more madly, temperatures rise,
lips tighten, voices sharpen. It is like
the day war was declared.” Elis re-
luctant admirer, Malcolm Muggeridge,
in a “New Statesman” “defence” so
(styled) concluded that despite his en-
gaging and honest character he was “in
politics, a non-starter, in letters, no
more than a privateer journalist, in
society, a turbulent nuisance -- an
embarrassment to his friends, a gift
to his enemies, and a brawling bore to
neutralist or uncommitted associates
. . . Still, he is an authentic hero of
our time.”
On landing, we walked without
speaking across the flight apron and
into the elaborate new International
Airport Building. I had left a cashmere
sweater on board the aircraft, raced
back to get it (too late, it had already
been stolen), and by the time I had
made some inquiries, returned to the
building, and entered the immigration
hall, all the passengers but Randolph
had been “processed” already.
He looked irritated.
“You’re not gentlemen!”
English,” he roared as my
visaed passport was stamped. “This
ridiculous little man here” - he ges-
tured at a tiny official, all moustache
and holster “doesn’t seem to be able
to understand the writing in my pass-
port and he doesn’t want to let me into
his absurd little country.” I murmured,
a vague sympathy and asked what the
trouble was. “This horrible little blank
obviously doesn’t realise who I am.”
(He really does call people “blanks”
although I have bowdlerised much cf
his language. His language is more re-
markable for its great variety of empha-
sis and high pitch when excited ■ —
rather like a Bentley horn - —• than for
range of vocabulary. His expletives were
generally theological, anatomical, and
scatological, in that order.)
“You had no right to come here with-
out a visa. You can’t come in without
it,” said the official.
“Look,” Randolph yelled, brandishing
a fist, “I’m Randolph Churchill and
I can go where I like. I’ll get my
Ambassador to deal with this if you
don’t fix me up at once. My father
created this country although I can't
imagine why. It was just bloody sand
and flies before that. My God! Travel-
ling once used to be a pleasure. In the
days before 1914 you didn’t even need a
passport.” (His voice rose to the vol-
ume and pitch of a platform orator.)
“All a gentleman had to do was pack his
bags and get a letter of credit from
his bankers and that was all there was
to it. But now gentlemen are sub-
ject to being ordered about by hordes
of petty officials little jacks-in-
office. Just because you all wear guns
and grubby uniforms, you think you’re
bloody Nasser.”
The loudspeaker system, breaking
into his flow, declaimed an announce-
ment. This seemed to incense Randolph
even more. “Yabber, yabber, yabber!
Have you ever heard such a noise in
all your life? What a dreadful ignor-
ant language it is. Just listen to it!
No wonder they can’t think. I almost
feel sorry for them. How awful never
to have said a noble word or had a
noble thought.”
“Are you with this man?” the offi-
cial asked me. “Yes, he is,” snarled
Randolph. “He’s my friend.” “In that
case you had better stay together.”
I supposed that they must have taken
me for Randolph’s secretary. “Open
your bags.” The official seemed disap-
pointed to find no ammunition in
either of them. He tried to open Ran-
dolph’s typewriter a machine he
obviously had no familiarity with. “Get
away from it, you little dictator. It
was a mistake giving you lot self-
government. It’s you small nations that
make the most noise. Once upon a
time when Britain ruled the waves
things were conducted on a gentlemanly
basis and you wouldn’t have treated
me like this. You blanks just aren’t
gentlemen.”
By now all eyes were upon us
with a semicircle of police stroking
their holsters lovingly. Randolph
opened his passport, pointed to the
name and held up his photograph (as
a blue-eyed young man of promise,
taken no doubt about 1935) in the
manner of a priest exhibiting an ikon.
They gazed at it without awe. The
official reached for it. “Don’t you take
that passport out of my sight. It’s
a very important document to me,
issued by Her Britannic Majesty.”
At last the officer-in-charge came
up, and after a brief consultation with
the first official asked Randolph why
he had no visa. “I didn’t have time
to get one. I didn’t know I was coming
here until yesterday when my paper
asked me to come. But if I need a visa
why don’t you damn-well give me one?”
The senior official said, “We don’t
want any trouble, but if you are to
come in you will have to pay for a
visa now.” Randolph asked if a cheque
would do. Oh, no. A traveller’s cheque?
No. Only Lebanese money—or English
money would do. The fee was 25
Lebanese pounds, but £2 English
would do. Randolph had only 36
shillings and asked could he borrow

four shillings from me until he could
change a cheque at his hotel.
I was glad to oblige. It seemed a
cheap investment in experience.
“You must have lunch with me to-
morrow, old boy,” he said, “and I will
show you all the sights, but I have to
see some people first. I’m writing for
the ‘Evening Standard,’ you know, so
I’m here doing the work of the Lord.”
He asked where I was from and sug-
gested that if I had nothing better
to do I might “stick around” and he
would give me a lift to the city by taxi
—“besides, I like having someone to
talk with.”
“What a ghastly country,” he sighed
as we walked into the open air. “Ever
been here before? Anyway, what is an
Australian doing in the Lebanon?” I
explained that it was on the way home.
“I was once in Australia, you know.
Lecture tour in 1947. Proper fiasco it
was, too. I seem to recall that Dick
Casey chaired a lecture for me in the
Melbourne Town Hall.”
Had he abandoned all hope for a poli-
tical career? “After six defeats I feel
that there is considerable consumer re-
sistance to me in the electorate and
nobody seems very keen to ask me to
stand. I liked being a Member of Par-
liament but the job of getting there is
most disagreeable.” But surely his
family connections would make him a
desirable property for development by
the Conservative Party? “Oh, God no!
The Churchills have never been re-
garded as particularly reliable by the
Conservatives—and we are all rather
anti-Establishment, you know. We have
always had a weakness for the deserv-
ing poor, and my father was a creator
of the welfare state. When I was a
young man I wanted to rebel, I sup-
pose, and I was very close to Socialism.
Bernard Shaw was the major influence
on me then, but I came to see that, in
practice, Socialism was prone to mean
too much bureaucracy, with people’s
lives being directed by officials like
those horrid blanks back there. Act-
ually, I’m really a Liberal. Liberalism’s
the thing. A great pity the party is a
bust. But since 1951 I have concen-
trated on my writing. That’s what I
want to be remembered for. If I had
returned to the Commons I would have
been thought of as my father’s ADC.”
A harassed young Lebanese hostess
moved by. “Look here!” said Randolph,
“where’s my taxi? My friend and I
have been waiting for hours.” She
explained, apologetically, that because
of the civil war Beirut was subject to
curfew, all vehicles had to be accom-
panied by motor-cycle escort, and,
accordingly, the only transport avail-
able was a company limousine, which
passengers and crew would have to
share. Randolph insisted that the cur-
few be lifted at once, and it was some
time before I could persuade him to
hand over his luggage and get in. His
typewriter was tossed on a luggage
rack on the roof, provoking a scream of
rage and a string of curses, a threnody
on the theme: “Inside the building it
looks all right but outside everything
is back in the 12th century.” Once in
the bus, Randolph exchanged pleasan-
tries with an uncomprehending Arab
who had encroached on space reserved
for the Churchill buttocks. But we were
still without an escort.
Randolph leaned across the young,
pale driver and began honking the
horn vigorously. “Honk! Honk! Let’s
go! Honk! Honk! What are we waiting
for? Honk! Honk! Hostess, why don’t
you tell this cretin of a driver to start?”
The unhappy driver replied himself,
“We must wait for the police escort.”
At last three motor-cycles, one com-
plete with side-car and officer-type-com-
mandant, roared up beside our vehicle.
“Oh, bravo!” called Randolph, clap-
ping his hands vigorously (an unfor-
givable insult in Lebanon, according to
the guidebooks, like slapping a Thai on
the back). “Congratulations, you brave
fellows! We are all so very grateful.”
“How dare you!”
W E were jammed in like Tokyo com-
muters. I sat directly behind
Randolph, clutching camera, books, and
toilet case. Before we left I had to open
the door and leave my seat so that a
fellow passenger could obey an insistent
call. I passed my packages to Randolph
while I got out. “What are you doing
to my friend?” he bellowed to the host-
ess. “How dare you inconvenience us!
You should have told that fellow to get
out the other side.”
At last our cavalcade set out for
Beirut, some eight miles distant, along a
magnificent pine - fringed highway,
superb by moonlight.
Randolph was soon infuriated by our
slow progress, wound down his window,
and addressed himself to the motor-
cycle escort. “Get a move on! I came
here to see some action. I want to get
to Beirut before dawn! Let’s go!”
They ignored him, so he turned to
the quavering driver. “Pass them! Go
on, it’s easy. If you don’t know how
to drive the car I’ll help you. You
know what your foot is, don’t you?”
He turned to me in despair. “Oh,
God! He doesn’t understand anything.”
The hostess asked our destinations
and told the driver in Arabic. I was
booked in at the Hotel Normandie,
Randolph at the Palm Beach. “And
when I get there I’ll demand an expla-
nation from the Embassy for not having
met me at the airport,” he warned.
Soon the limousine began dropping
passengers in the suburbs, pursuing a
circuitous route to Randolph’s vast
annoyance revealed at every stop.
Then he began to recognise the streets
along the Mediterranean seafront.
“They’ll drop you next, old boy
your pub’s the nearest. Remember,
we’ll meet at the Palm Beach for lunch
at noon.” But we were due for a sur-
prise. Something had apparently
snapped in the tormented driver: he
reversed the vehicle, sliced a few cor-
ners, drove like Jehu and screeched to
a stop outside the Palm Beach Hotel.
“What’s wrong with you?” demanded
Randolph. “Why didn’t you go to my
friend’s hotel first? That was the
nearest.” “It just seemed better this
way,” the driver murmured, tonelessly.
And so we parted. In the morning I
investigated this most courteous of
civil wars, which ended in July when
President Eisenhower sent in a Marine
force at the government’s request. In
the streets rival groups manned sand-
bagged gunposts in shifts, then went
to office or school together, often apolo-
gising (I was told) for any inconveni-
ence caused. They shot occasionally at
night to relieve the tedium, but rarely
in daylight, and casualties were low.
However, I arrived at the British Em-
bassy at 10.30 a.m. just in time to see
the body of a youth, shot dead on the
steps a few minutes earlier. The mess
was being cleaned from the steps before
the stretcher arrived.
The First Secretary, H. A. Overton,
was surprisingly well informed. (So was
“Time,” which reported Randolph’s on-
slaught a week later.) “I believe you
had a tricky night with Randolph last
night. There are no secrets in Beirut
and he was very vocal about his griev-
ances.”
I told him that we were lunching
together. “Oh, no you’re not,” he said.
“Randolph has gone back to England
already. He decided he didn’t like the
hotel or the curfew, told the Embassy
staff by phone what he thought of
them, and decided that the Lebanon had
used enough of his valuable time. He
found there was a plane leaving later
that night, called up a police escort, and
went straight to the airport. ‘Just
think,’ Randolph said, ‘tomorrow morn-
ing I will be sniffing roses in Kent’.”

THE OTHER SEX
The Kins of Mink
IT comes as a bit
of a shock to
discover that
the King of Mink
is in reality a mild
62-year-old English-
man called Albert
Woodley, who car-
ries a 21b. ball of
string everywhere
he goes because no
one ever has any.
Mr. Woodley got caught up in the
mink biz 22 years ago when a worried
breeder found cast-off grey pelts were
accumulating faster than cast-on dark
brown. How to turn undesirable Silver
Blue, as it quickly became christened,
into a desirable commodity? Mr. Wood-
ley, adept in the art of snappy decision-
making via his training in advertising,
decided to go straight to the top: make
grey and other unfashionable pale
colors appeal to those who already have
everything, i.e., royalty and ladies with
money to burn.
He approached Christian Dior, Balen-
ciaga, and the late Jacques Fath in
France in 1948, when the fashion trade
was looking for something to perk it
up after World War II doldrums. They
liked what they saw, and bought.
Then he thought, who are the most
famous people in the world who would
wear these pale shades? The Queen,
would she accept a jasmine (white)
mink coat? It seemed unlikely. She
accepted flowers, though, without ques-
tion, reasoned Mr. Woodley, so did the
Pope, and so did Khrushchev. People
rushed flowers through Khrushchev’s
bodyguard with the greatest of ease,
as an expression of their admiration of
the man. Why shouldn’t the Queen ac-
cept a present of jasmine mink from
EMBA (the Mutation Mink Breeders’
Association), who admired her as a
woman? These things need careful
handling. Publicity via royalty is not
allowed, as all good ad-men know, but
to everyone’s surprise the Queen not
only accepted a mink but chose a
grey one into the bargain. Mr. Woodley
was delighted with the subtle way the
Press handled the story. “What can
you give a woman who has everything?
Answer: Mink,” they wrote.
Someone noticed how cold priests’
feet got in Rome. “They wore,” says
Mr. Woodley, “fur-lined boots under
their robes, and I thought, why not
send the Pope a mink cape to keep
him warm?” He did, and the Pope said
it was too good for him, but fortun-
ately for EMBA kept it. Mr. Woodley
never stopped to think how much it
cost, but it was very precious.
Nowadays the going is easier. Wher-
ever there is money and taste, says Mr.
Woodley, EMBA are there with all
their 34 glorious shades, including the
newest pink mink. There is a roaring
trade for mink even in monsoonal
countries like Hong Kong. And over
in Frankfurt, the very centre of fur
hoo-haa, EMBA is now the biggest
draw at the five-day yearly event. He
has travelled most places with his
minks, not Russia, of course, who’d
want to sell their own not buy, and
in all 22 years has only once lost a
coat. The girl modelling it had slipped
out for a coffee with her boyfriend,
presumably to show it off, but EMBA
got it back. It gave them a nasty shock
at the time, even though they were
insured. He and his assistant, Miss
Suter, guard them like hawks, but
they don’t use armed bodyguards.
Mr. Woodley says men buy mink
for girls because it is an investment,
not, as commonly thought, because it
is a status symbol. All the same, a
mink coat’s life is only about ten years.
Then you either sell it or have it re-
styled. But, goodness, no, you don’t
trade in a mink like a motor-car or
refrigerator. The advantage of mink
is its practicability, the ease with which
it can be worn for any social occasion,
and the present trend for skinny,
shorter coats is all right by Mr. Woodley,
even if they do take less mink to make.
Some men might think mink should
be voluminous with yards and yards
of it trailing round a girl, but they
don’t have to cope with it, do they?
Fun furs, says Mr. Woodley, are good
for biz. The dyed coneys, et cetera, gave
girls a taste for mink when they could
afford it later.
In his opinion, however much the
market was flooded with mink, it could
never become common. In America
there is a saying: “Mink or Nothing.”
The total consumption of mink per
year there is about ten million skins,
worth roughly 110 million American
dollars. There are 970 firms turning
out mink compared with 350 firms
turning out persian lamb.
Wherever the King of Mink goes he
sounds out the market for new trends.
He does this by the simple process of
asking furriers what women have been
asking for lately, and this information,
he says, shows where the next trend
will be coming. Having learnt this he
proceeds not to give what has been
asked for, but this is the tricky bit
jumping one step ahead and pro-
viding the next thing.
This is his second recent visit to
Australia. His mind is made up. Women
hankering for Spotted Leopard can
forget it. What they are going to get
is Aurora Chinchilla. Aurora will be
here, he says, with all ten hairs grow-
ing out of one follicle, by Christmas.
I would be much obliged, however,
if he could see his way to slipping
my bit of goat through a trifle earlier.
DAPHNE GUINNESS


WHAT I BELIEVE
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
IN trying to formulate what I believe
I have to begin with what I dis-
believe. I disbelieve in a progress,
the pursuit of happiness, and all the
concomitant notions and projects for
creating a society in which human be-
ings find ever greater contentment by
being given in ever greater abundance
the means to satisfy their material and
bodily hopes and desires. In other
words, I consider that the way of life
in urbanised, rich countries as it exists
today, and as it is likely to go on de-
veloping, is probably the most de-
graded and unillumined ever to come
to pass on earth.
The half-century in which I have
been consciously alive seems to me to
have been quite exceptionally destruc-
tive, murderous, and brutal. More
people have been killed and terrorised,
more driven from their homes and
native places; more of the past’s herit-
age has been destroyed, more lies
propagated and base persuasion en-
gaged in, with less compensatory
achievement in art, literature, and im-
aginative understanding, than in any
comparable period of history.
Ever since I can remember, the
image of earthly power, whether in the
guise of schoolmaster, mayor, judge,
prime minister, monarch, or any other,
has seemed to me derisory. I was en-
chanted when I first read in the “Pen-
sees” (Pascal being one of the small,
sublime band of fellow-humans to
whom one may turn and say in the
deepest humility: “I agree”) about how
magistrates and rulers had to be garbed
in their ridiculous ceremonial robes,
crowns, and diadems. Otherwise, who
would not see through their threadbare
pretensions? I am conscious of having
been ruled by buffoons, taught by
idiots, preached at by hypocrites, and
preyed upon by charlatans in the guise
of advertisers and other professional
persuaders, as well as verbose dema-
gogues and ideologues of many opinions,
all false.
Nor, as far as I am concerned, is
there any recompense in the so-called
achievements of science. It is true that
in my lifetime more success has been
achieved in unravelling the composition
and mechanism of the material universe
than previously in the whole of recorded
time. This atom has been split; the
universe has been discovered, and will
soon be explored. Neither achievements
has any bearing on what alone interests
me which is why life exists, and what
is the significance, if any, of my minute
and so transitory part in it. All the
world in a grain of sand: all the uni-
verse, too. If I could understand a
grain of sand I should understand
everything. Why, then, should going to
the moon and Mars, or spending a holi-
day along the Milky Way, be expected
to advance me further in my quest than
going to Manchester and Liverpool, or
spending a holiday in Brighton?
Education, the great mumbo-jumbo
and fraud of the age, purports to equip
us to live, and is prescribed as a uni-
versal remedy for everything from juv-
enile delinquency to premature senility.
For the most part, it only serves to en-
large stupidity, inflate conceit, enhance
credulity, and put those subjected to
it at the mercy of brain-washers with
printing presses, radio and television at
their disposal.
I have seen pictures of huge, ungainly
prehistoric monsters who developed
such a weight of protective shell that
they sank under its burden and be-
came extinct. Our civilisation likewise
is sinking under the burden of its own
defence, nuclear and other, and may
well soon be extinct. As this fact sinks
into the collective consciousness, the
resort to drugs, dreams, fantasies, and
Malcolm Muggeridge
other escapist devices, particularly sex,
becomes ever more marked.
Living thus in the twilight of a spent
civilisation, amidst its ludicrous and
frightening shadows, what is there to
believe? Curiously enough, these twilit
circumstances provide a setting in
which, as it seems to me, the purpose
which lies behind them stands out with
particular clarity. As human love only
shines in all its splendor when the last
tiny glimmer of desire has been ex-
tinguished, so we have to make the
world a wilderness to find God.
The meaning of the universe lies
beyond history as love lies beyond
desire. That meaning shines forth in
moments if illumination (which come
and go so unaccountably; though, I am
thankful to say, never quite ceasing
a sound of music, far, far away, and
drowned by other more tumultuous
noises, but still to be faintly and fitfully
heard) with an inconceivable clarity
and luminosity. It breaks like a crystal-
line dawn out of darkness, and the
deeper the darkness the more crystal-
line the dawn.
Let me express it, as I have often
thought of it, in terms of a stage. In
the middle is the workaday world where
we live our daily lives, earning a living,
reading newspapers, exchanging money,
recording votes, chattering, and eating,
and desiring. I call this the Cafe Limbo.
On the left of the stage is an area of
darkness within which shapes and
movements can be faintly discerned,
and inconclusive noises heard; sounds
and sweet airs which, as on Caliban’s
Island, give delight and hurt not. I call
this Life. The right of the stage is bright
with arc-lamps like a television studio.
This is where history is unfolded and
news is made; this is where we live our
public, collective lives, seat and unseat
rulers, declare wars and negotiate peace,
glow with patriotism and get carried
away with revolutionary zeal, enact
laws, declaim rhetoric, swear eternal
passion and sink into abysses of desola-
tion. I call this the Legend.
Across this triple stage, between Life,
the Cafe Limbo, and the Legend, a
drama is endlessly performed. Two
forces shape the play the Imagina-
tion which belongs to Life, and the
Will which belongs to the Legend.
Out of the Imagination comes love,
understanding, goodness, self-abne-
gation: every true synthesis ever
grasped. Out of the Will comes lust,
hatred, cupidity, adulation, power,
oratory: every false anti-thesis ever pro-
pounded or to be propounded.
Those who belong exclusively or
predominately to Life are saints, mystics,
and artists. In extreme cases Christ,
for instance they have to be killed.
(This is superbly explained in the
famous Grand Inquistor passage in
“The Brothers Karamazov,” Dostoevsky
being, like Pascal, of the small band.)
Those who belong exclusively or pre-
dominantly to the Legend are power-
maniacs, rulers, heroes, demagogues,
and liberators. In the extreme cases
Hitler, for instance they bring about
their own destruction. In Life there is
suffering, deprivation, and sanity: in
the Legend, excitement, abundance, and
madness.
Most of us spend the greater part of
our time in the Cafe Limbo, casting
an occasional glance in the direction of
Life and more than an occasional one
in the direction of the Legend. Laughter
is our best recourse, with the bar to
provide a fillip as and when required.
The Cafe Limbo is licensed. When a
character passes from the Legend into
Life he brings some of the light with
him: shining like a glow-worm, until
gradually the light subsides and goes
out, swallowed up in the darkness of
Life.
This same pattern may be traced

more particularly and tragically in a
single countenance, as anyone will be
aware who has had occasion to watch
over a loved face hovering between
sanity and madness. (And many have.
For as we abolish the ills and pains of
the flesh we multiply those of the mind,
so that by the time mankind are finally
delivered from disease and decay - all
pasteurised, their genes counted and
rearranged, fitted with new replaceable
plastic organs, able to eat, fornicate,
and perform other physical functions
innocuously and hygenically as and
when desired they will all be mad,
and the world one huge psychiatric
ward.)
You study the loved, distracted face
as a scholar might study some ancient
manuscript, looking for a key to its
incomprehensibility. What you see is a
fight to the death between the Will
and the Imagination. If the former
wins, then the flickering light will be
put out for ever; if the latter, it will
shine again, to burn with a steady radi-
ance. Oh, beloved, you have come back
to me.
I am well aware that, psychiatric-ally
speaking, this is nonsensical. Yet I be-
lieve it. I see the two forces struggling
for mastery in each individual soul; in
mine, in everyone’s; in each collectively,
throughout our earth and throughout
the vast universe. One is of darkness
and one of light; one wants to drag
us down into the dark trough to rut
and gorge there, and the other to raise
us up into the azure sky, beyond ap-
petite, where love is all-embracing, all-
encompassing, and the dark confusion
of life sorts itself out, like an orderly,
smiling countryside, suddenly glimpsed
from a high hill. One is the Devil and
the other God. I have known both, and
I believe in both.
For we Western Europeans the
Christian religion has expressed this
ancient, and, as I consider, obvious
dichotomy in terms of breathtaking
simplicity and sublimity. It was not
the first word on the subject, nor will
it be the last; but it is still our Word.
I accept it. I believe, as is written in
the New Testament, that if we would
save our lives we must lose them; that
we cannot live by bread alone; that
we must die in the flesh to be reborn
in the spirit, and that the flesh lusts
contrary to the spirit and the spirit
contrary to the flesh; that God cannot
see a sparrow fall to the ground with-
out concern, and has counted the hairs
of each head, so that all that lives
deserves our respect and reverence, and
no one man can conceivably be more
important, of greater significance, or
in any way more deserving of con-
sideration than any other.
It is true that these basic propositions
of Christianity have got cluttered up
with dogma of various kinds which I
find often incomprehensible, irrelevant,
and even repugnant. All the same, I
should be proud and happy to be able
to call myself a Christian: to dare to
measure myself against that im-
measurably high standard of human
values and human behaviour. In this
I take comfort from another saying of
Pascal, thrown out like a lifeline to all
sceptical minds throughout the ages—
that whoever looks for God has found
Him.
As its most obscurantist and debased,
the Christian position still seems to me
preferable to any scientific-materialist
one, however cogent and enlightened.
The evangelist with his lurid tract call-
ing upon me to repent for the Day of
Judgment is at hand, is a burning and a
shining light compared with the eugen-
ist who claims the right to decide in his
broiler-house mind which lives should
be protracted and which must be put
out; or with the colporteurs of sterility
who so complacently and selfrighteously
display their assortment of contracep-
tives to the so-called backward peoples
of the world as our civilisation’s noblest
achievement and most precious gift.
The mushroom backdrop
The absurdities of the Kingdom of
Heaven, as conceived in the minds of
simple believers, are obvious enough
pearly gates, angelic choirs, golden
crowns, and shining raiment. But what
are we to think of the (in Johnson’s
excellent phrase) sheer unresisting
imbecility of the Kingdom of Heaven
on Earth, as envisaged and recom-
mended by the most authoritative and
powerful voices of our time? The Gross
National Product rising for evermore,
and its beneficiaries, rich in hire-
purchase, stupefied with the telly and
with sex, comprehensively educated,
told by Professor Hoyle how the world
began and by Canon Collins how it
will end; on the broad highways ven-
turing forth, three lanes a side, with
lay-bys to rest in and birth-pills to keep
them intacta if not virgo, as an extra
thrill blood spattering the tarmac;
heaven lying about them in the super-
market, the rainbow ending in the near-
est bingo hall, leisure burgeoning out in
multitudinous shining aerials rising like
dreaming spires into the sky; happiness
in as many colors as there are pills
green and yellow and blue and red
and shining white; many mansions,
mansion of light and chromium, climb-
ing ever upward.
This Kingdom, surely, can only be
for posterity an unending source of
wry derision always assuming there
is to be any posterity. The backdrop,
after all, is the mushroom cloud; as
the Gadarene herd frisk and frolic they
draw ever nearer to the cliff’s edge.
I recognise, of course, that this state-
ment of belief is partly governed by
the circumstance that I am old; and
in at most a decade or so will be dead.
In earlier years I should doubtless have
expressed things differently. Now the
prospect of death overshadows all
others. I am like a man on a sea voyage
nearing his destination. When I em-
barked I worried about having a cabin
with a porthole, whether I should be
asked to sit at the captain’s table, who
were the more attractive and important
passengers. All such considerations be-
come pointless when I shall soon be
disembarking.
As I do not believe that earthly life
can bring any lasting satisfaction, the
prospects of death holds no terrors.
Those saints who pronounce themselves
in love with death displayed, I consider,
the best of sense: not a Freudian death-
wish. Likewise Pastor Bonhoeffer when
he told his Nazi guards, as they took
him away to be executed, that for them
it was an end but for him a beginning,
in that place of darkest evil he, the
victim, shining and radiant. The world
that I shall soon be leaving seems more
than ever beautiful: especially its re-
motest parts, grass, and trees and sea
and rivers and little streams and slop-
ing hills, where the image of eternity
is more clearly stamped than among
streets and houses. Those I love I can
love even more, since I have nothing
to ask of them but their love; the
passion to accumulate possessions, or to
be noticed and important, is too evi-
dently absurd to be any longer enter-
tained.
A sense of how extraordinarily happy
I have been, and of enormous grati-
tude to my Creator, overwhelms me
often. I believe with a passionate, un-
shakable conviction that in all circum-
stances and at all times life is a blessed
gift: and the spirit which animates it
is one of love, not hate or indifference,
of light, not darkness, of creativity, not
destruction, of men, creatures, plants,
as well as insensate matter, and all that
is known about it, now and henceforth,
has been benevolently, not malevolently,
conceived, when the eyes see no more
and the mind thinks no more, and this
hand now writing is inert, whatever lies
beyond will similarly be benevolently,
not malevolently, conceived.
If it is nothing, then for nothing-
ness I offer thanks; if another mode
of existence, with this old worn-out
husk of a body left behind, like a
butterfly extricating itself from its
chrysalis, and this floundering muddled
mind, now at best seeing through a
glass darkly, given a longer range and
a new precision, then for that likewise
I offer thanks.

An Orchestra Hitler Built
By NECHEMIA MYERS
ISRAEL has a second-rate literature
and theatre, but it has a first-rate
symphony orchestra, as Australian
music lovers will learn.
The Israel Philharmonic begins its
tour in Perth on August 10 and will
play in Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra,
Sydney, and Brisbane. Conductors will
be Zubin Mehta, of India, Antal Dor-
ati, making his fourth visit to Australia,
and the gifted young Israeli Eliahu
Inbal.
The man mainly responsible for the
IPO’s eminence was, ironically enough,'
Adolf Hitler. He drove thousands of
talented Jewish musicians out of Europe
and a good many of them found their
way to Palestine. There were also gifted
actors and writers among the refugees
streaming into Haifa, Jerusalem, and
Tel Aviv, but most of them were
silenced by their inability to work in a
new language, Hebrew. Musicians, how-
ever, were more fortunate; A cellist
in Berlin was able to continue to play
in Tel Aviv provided, of course, that
someone found the means to support
him.
That someone was world-famous
violinist Bronislaw Huberman. In his
concert tours of Palestine in the late
’2os and early ’3os Huberman was im-
pressed by the enthusiasm for music
that he found in what was, after all,
a very small and provincial country
with a “European” population of less
than half a million. So when the racial
laws of the Third Reich deprived
Jewish musicians of their posts, he de-
cided that the time had come “to unite
the desire of the country for an orches-
tra with the desire of European
musicians for a country.”
Huberman found the players, the
finances, and an outstanding musician
to conduct the initial concerts, Arturo
Toscanini. On December 26, 1936, the
great Italian maestro led 76 men and
women through works by Rossini,
Brahms, Schubert, Mendelssohn, and
Weber, and sent the orchestra,. then
known as the Palestine Philharmonic,
on its way.
If the musicians thought that they
were going to find peace and quiet
in their new place of refuge, they
were mistaken, as they soon discovered.
The period from 1936 to 1938 was one
of Arab riots. When the orchestra went
to perform in an outlying area, it
travelled in an armored bus and with
a military escort. These disturbances
were followed by World War 11, when
concerts were given just behind the
front lines in Egypt’s Western Desert.
Then, less than three years after the
international conflict ended, Israel’s
War of Independence began.
The orchestra found itself in the
very centre of events. It played “Hatik-
vah,” the national anthem, after the
signing of the new nation’s Declaration
of Independence in the Tel Aviv
Museum on May 14, 1948. The next
morning Tel Aviv was bombed and
the war began in earnest, but the
orchestra kept to its schedule.
All the regular concerts took place,
with the exception of those which were
to have been given in besieged Jerusa-
lem. And as soon as the siege was
partially lifted with the completion of
the secretly built “Burma Road,” the
members of the orchestra travelled to
Jerusalem by command car to give a
series of concerts under the batoh of
Izler Solomon.
The 1949 season brought a new
name, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra,
an exciting conductor to open it
Leonard Bernstein and armistice
agreements with the Arabs. The IPO
turned its attention to the relatively
simple problem of creating beautiful
music and the much more compli-
cated one of supporting itself.
The Israel Philharmonic is probably
the only symphonic orchestra in the
world that covers over 90 percent of
its budget from the sale of tickets,
most of them purchased on a subscrip-
tion basis. The facts of its financial life
affect everything the orchestra does and
plays.
First, it gives eleven concerts per fort-
night, which is too many for the musi-
cians, though not enough for the audi-
ences. The orchestra has some 35,000
regular subscribers and could probably
have twice as many if more subscrip-
tions were available. For those who
were not born with a subscription, or
did not subsequently inherit one, there
is very little chance of hearing the
Philharmonic (except on the radio or
on records).
Secondly, the orchestra is careful to
choose an audience-pleasing repertoire.

and Mozart,” is the way one member
of the orchestra’s staff put it.
The same need to satisfy the public
also serves to keep Israeli music off the
music stands. Local composers, like
their counterparts abroad, tend to write
in the modern idiom, and this is not
what the ticketholders want. An occas-
ional work by an Israeli composer is
included in the program (especially
during foreign tours), but this is more
a public-relations effort than an indica-
tion of a genuine interest in the achieve-
ments of local creators of music. This,
at least, seems to be the logical ex-
planation for the fact that the Israel
Philharmonic’s prospectus for the
1965-66 season, which indicated that a
grand total of three compositions by
local composers would be played,
identified two of them only as “Israeli
works to be announced.”
Israeli conductors and soloists are
represented more fully than Israeli
composers in the IPO’s concerts, but
the great bulk of conductors and soloists
are from abroad, and they are a very
distinguished group indeed. In fact,
there are very few of the world’s lead-
ing musicians who have not appeared
with the IPO in the past decade.
rfHE orchestra’s guests have included
pianist Artur Rubinstein, Claudio
Arrau, Rudolf Serkin, Clifford Curzon,
Gina Bachauer, Glenn Gould, Van
Cliburn, and Vladimir Ashkenazy;
violinists Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menu-
hin, Isaac Stern, Zino Francescatti,
Leonid Kogan, David Oistrakh, and
Henryk Szeryng; violist William Prim-
rose; and cellists Gregor Piatigorsky,
Mstislav Rostropovitch, and Antonio
Janigro.
Among the visiting conductors on the
IPO’s podium were Serge Kousse-
vitzky, Pierre Monteux, Dimitri Mitro-
poulos, Charles Munch, Leonard Bern-
stein, William Steinberg, Erich Leins-
dorf, Sir John Barbirolli, Paul Paray,
Carlo Maria Guilini, Josef Krips, Sergin
Celbidache, Georg Solti, Jean Mar-
tinou, Antal Dorati, Raphael Kubelik,
Istvan Kertesz, Zubin Mehta, and
Lorin Maazel.
While it has had a host of famous
guest conductors, the Israel Philhar-
monic has, through most of its history,
been without a permanent one of its
own. This may be because, as some
argue, no conductor of the requisite
stature could be obtained, or, as others
suggest, because the public prefers a
galaxy of conducting stars rather than
a regular conductor. The fact that
there is no permanent figure on the
podium may give the orchestra greater
flexibility, a quality for which it is
famous, but it also precludes the crea-
tion of a specific IPO style.
The 100-man Israel Philharmonic,
like any orchestra, has its stronger and
weaker sections. Its strings are superb,
which is presumably because they are
“Jewish” instruments. The same factor
probably also accounts for the relative
weakness of its woodwind and brass
sections. The orchestra’s repertoire is
also influenced by its “Jewishness” in
that Wagner, regarded in Israel as a
pre-Nazi Nazi, is kept off the pro-
gram.
The IPO’s tour of Australia (and
New Zealand) will bring it to that part
of the world for the first time, but it
will by no means be the orchestra’s first
appearance abroad. It has played in
the United States and Europe several
times, as well as in Canada, Mexico,
Japan, and India. It was also scheduled
to give a series of concerts in the Soviet
Union this year, but the trip has been
postponed.
The IPO does not go overseas to
make money, since foreign tours are
staggeringly expensive, as they are for
any orchestra. It goes essentially to win
friends and influence people on Israel’s
behalf. And that it certainly does.

produced by Emerald Hill —Schisgal’s
“The Tiger” concerns the attempt of
an extremely hypertense young man
to imprison and dominate a red-blooded
American girl. In “Epiphany” the
ornothologist tried to transform himself
into an omnipotent rooster, only to
lay an egg. In “The Tiger,” an eccen-
tric postman who snarls about Nietz-
sche and Schopenhauer kidnaps a
housewife for the purpose of ritual
murder, but in another symbolic cas-
tration she is soon darning his socks
and setting him French homework.
In “The Typists” we spend a 30-
year day in a shabby office. In the
morning a young man arrives for his
first day at a new job and reports
to his female supervisor. He’s struggling
through a law course at night and is
increasingly self-pitying. Miss Payton
is still young, but we can see that
embittered spinsterhood is fast ap-
proaching. In the course of the morn-
ing they flirt, fight, and confide their
dreams. In the afternoon they rage
impotently against their destinies. And
at five o’clock they leave the office
middle-aged and defeated. Schisgal
skilfully compresses two lifetimes into
an hour-glass, and while the play has
nothing new to say at least it says
it with humor and compassion.
In both plays Schisgal’s style re-
quires the actors to create something
less than real characterisations, but
more than sociological archetypes. One
way lies bathos, the other the tempta-
tion of easy laughs. But Brian Young
and Julia Blake gave balanced and
inventive performances in Jon Ewing’s
intelligent productions.
“Once More With Feeling” concerns
a young American maestro who con-
ducts orchestras brilliantly and himself
badly. He keeps having predictably
maestro-ish tantrums in which he
assaults inadequate musicians with their
instruments.
The best thing in the play is Fabian’s
Jewish manager, who keeps affirming
his honesty with such ringing oaths as,
“If I tell a lie, may I arrange a concert
for the Daughters of the American
Revolution and accidentally book Paul
Robeson.” There’s some scrupulously
inoffensive bedroom farce and a lot
of dialogue damaged by artificial use of
musical jargon. While the first two
acts were “vivace,” act three collapsed
into “largo,” but there’s no denying
that “Once More” was funny in its
broad Broadway way.
St. Martin’s production was as expert
as ever, and the cast thoroughly com-
petent. Max Bruch was excellent as the
head-clutching manager, Marcella Bur-
goyne played Dolly with her usual poise,
and Frederick Parslow surely Vic-
toria’s most reliable and versatile actor
played Victor.
PHILLIP ADAMS
FILMS
Waugh Embalmed
The Loved One. Tony Richardson.
Gala Theatre, Sydney. <
WHY did Tony Richardson decide
to film Evelyn Waugh’s “The
Loved One”? There could hardly be a
writer and a director more widely
separated in style and temperament.
“The Loved One” is the shortest and
simplest of Waugh’s books, but in its
own small compass it is a flawless, ex-
quisitely polished gem. What happens
when director Richardson and script-
writers Terry Southern and Christopher
Isherwood get at it? What happens is
a noisy, muddled film which lurches
from social satire to burlesque slap-
stick and back again, which makes no
coherent whole but is undoubtedly very
funny at times, whose resemblance to
the original in style or spirit is difficult
indeed to detect.
Waugh’s original novella, subtitled
“An Anglo-American Tragedy,” is the
story of Dennis Barlow, minor poet and
major drifter, who fetches up in Holly-
wood as house guest of Sir Francis Hins-
ley, another English expatriate, and as
employee of a pets’ cejnetery called the
Happier Hunting Grounds. Sir Francis’
dismissal by the studio that has em-
ployed him for 30 years drives him to
hang himself, and so Dennis makes his
first acquaintance with Whispering
Glades, the cathedral of the American
way of death, and with the mortuary
cosmetician Aimee, who is also loved
by Mr. Joyboy, the maestro of em-
balmers.
Though often regarded purely as a
satirical exposure of the sanctimonious
commercialisation of death and grief—
about which it certainly has had some
abrasive comments the book delves
more deeply into the conflict within an
organised society between the innocent
and the wily, summarised by the des-
truction of the gentle, simple-hearted
Aimee by those who have learned, as she
cannot do, to compromise with their
faith in absolute truth, in fact to live
in the world. After her suicide, the two
men who profess to love her and do
within their own limits set about
protecting their reputations and en-
suring their futures.
When Richardson first began filming,
he was quoted as saying (to Waugh’s
understandable annoyance) that he re-
garded the book as “dated” and in
need of jazzing up. Anyone bringing
a novel to the screen must, of course,
make adjustments, but it would be
hard to justify or even comprehend
some of these adaptations. Richardson
has updated the thing by adding
modish jokes about James Bond, astro-
nauts, the Queen, and television com-
mercials; there are irrelevant sequences
of knockabout comedy; all the jests
are repeated frequently and loudly.
Undeniably, the film has its
moments: the scriptwriters often hit on
a funny scene or a witty line, and one
even hears Waugh’s acidulous tones
now and then. There is a brilliant
sequence between Margaret Leighton
and Milton Berle as bereaved dog-
owners; and, best of all, John Gielgud
is dignified and touching as the elderly
failure, Sir Francis; Rod Steiger, too,
gives a splendid characterisation of Mr.
Joyboy, the mother-dominated prince
of embalmers. These two seem to have
decided to play the original characters
—whatever Tony Richardson may have
intended.

BOOKS
Christina Stead’s Genius
By DAVID MARTIN
The Man Who Loved Children. Chris-
tina Stead. Seeker and Warburg. $4.60.
IN his review of “Seven Poor Men of
Sydney” in THE BULLETIN, lan
Cross, observing that nobody could
have predicted in 1934 that Christina
Stead was only going to earn a place
in limbo, promised to turn to her later
novels to find out whether she deserved
a better fate: “It would be wonderful
to discover that she belongs in heaven,
after all.”
In my view this is certainly where
she belongs, assuming that heaven, a
place reserved for what were people
once, is not an abode of absolute per-
fection. Christina Stead is a very great
writer; in the splendid constellation of
women novelists this nation has pro-
duced, she and Henry Handel Richard-
son stand foremost. Both are Australians
only in a limited sense, however, and
neither can be assigned to the literature
of any given country. Rather, and this
is particularly true of Christina Stead,
do they belong to the high literature
of our tongue, though “The Man Who
Loved Children” must, if it fits in any-
where, go into the American canon. It
has won belated fame, but I think no
one has pointed out that it is also
peripherally a work of satire ... a
satire on the romantic giantism per-
vading certain American classics, in-
cluding Longfellow’s and Whitman’s.
Sam Pollit, the hero of this huge story,
is the Body Electric that has blown a
fuse. The danger of a short circuit is
always present where powerful currents
are sent through wires not fully in-
sulated by experience.
“The Man Who Loved Children” was
written six years after the publication of
“The Salzburg Tales,” and four after
the appearance of “Seven Poor Men of
Sydney.” It is undoubtedly a far richer
achievement than the latter, but there
are many points of similarity: Catherine
and Michael Baguenault are cousins
under the skin to Sam and Henrietta
(“Henny”) Pollit. “The Salzburg
Tales,” marvellous as some of them are,
and distinguished throughout by a style
of the most forceful originality, is still
essentially a tour de force. Like all her
other books it creates a world indeed
many worlds which have their
reality mainly in their author’s liberated
imagination, but they do not have the
unchallengeable authority, or the
weight, of the small, complex world
of the Pollit family. It is hardly sur-
prising that nothing of equal import-
ance followed this painful epic, and
Prof. Randall Jarrell, Christina Stead’s
tireless paladin, could be wrong when,
in his long preface, “An Unread Book,”
he blames it on the discouragement
springing from public neglect.
“The Man Who Loved Children,”
like the Richard Mahoney trilogy with
which it shares some of the character-
istics of autobiography as well as a cer-
tain slackness of structural control, is
not the kind of book many writers
could repeat or surpass. For that it is
too honest and ruthless. But whereas
Henry Handel Richardson laid no claim
to being a master of prose, Miss Stead
is such a master, and in her case it is
a master’s exuberance which sometimes
leads us to call “enough.” So uncom-
promisingly does she identify herself
with her three central characters, Sam,
Henny, and Henny’s half-daughter,
Louie, that she does not seem to know
when to stop telling us about them
and their domestic civil war. The
patient reader will be glad, for in the
process they cease, very much like
Polly and Richard, to be figures of
fiction: at every point one wants to
interrupt the surge to argue about
their destiny, its inevitability or other-
wise. To me it remains debatable
whether Sam, for all his Dionysian
boundlessness, or perhaps because of it,
is as plausibly created as the poor Irish
doctor. He recalls rather too much some
of the cavaliers in “The Salzburg
Tales,” whose larger-than-lifeness out-
runs our staying power and compassion.
Of Henny and Louie this could never
be said but then H.H.R. is almost
alone among women writers in her
power to deal truthfully with both
sexes.
The Pollits live in a rambling house
in Washington’s Georgetown. Sam
works for the Conservation Department;
he is a passionate naturalist and an
antique republican. Henny comes from
a good Baltimore family, but long ago
she has been beaten down by her hus-
band’s remorseless energy and Homeric
selfishness. She drinks, she has a des-
perate and mean affaire, she hates him
and she hates her stepdaughter, who
is an ugly duckling of twelve summers,
a Cinderella bloated with cryptic genius
and secret poetry. There are five other
children, of whom only one, ten-year-
old Ernie, becomes very substantial.
The house is a hell; but to the children,
except Louie, it seems like paradise,
until they grow old enough to suffer
from Sam’s terror-inspiring love.
Love: I am not sure whether the
word should not be put in quotation
marks, but such is this writer’s way
with emotions that, to the end, we are
uncertain what our feelings about Sam
should be. It is true that he loves
children!
He is genuine, sincere. He is also


a disgusting faker. He is a spiritual
sado-masochist, a female in man’s dis-
guise who allows nobody a private soul.
When he beats Louie he coos to her
yearningly. He has an adult baby lan-
guage of his own, partly stolen from
Artemus Ward. This great, tentaculous
jellyfish sucks dry all he touches, but
above all Louie, whose reserved ado-
lescent femininity becomes an unbear-
able defiance. She, too, has a language
of her own the language of the
unfolding artist. In this inferno of the
half-sane, with toddlers, infants, and
urchins joyously hopping to the whistle
of their paternal scoutmaster, where
father and mother address each other
only through their offspring or their fists,
she is at first a tragic little Cordelia.
But at last it all becomes too much
for her. When she realises that the
younger ones risk being devoured and
destroyed, as their home comes to the
verge of disintegration, she decides to
murder Sam and Henny. Henny co-
operates to the extent that her death
partakes of suicide, and Samuel, sur-
viving, will never believe that the girl’s
confession is more than another neu-
rotic invention. To the unselfconscious
fantast all is fantasy.
Henny’s is the tremendous likeness of
a voluble, sentimental, shrewish, un-
happy, henlike woman with a heart
like a shapeless, dirty, but roomy, shop-
ping bag. There is nothing quite like
it in all Anglo-Saxon literature. She
contrives for her brood, she fights tooth
and nail for a few inches of Lebensraum
in which to shelter from Sam’s
ravaging virtue, until once more
she betrays herself into his bed, and
her last hope is gone. Pathetically avid
for an affection she knows is not really
her due, she does not scruple to rifle
Ernie’s moneybox for the wherewith-
als to pay for a fleeting escape. Her
existence is the ultimate in sordidness,
yet redeemed by a not entirely diseased
tenacity and a greedy concern for her
young. Louie is her enemy because she
is clean below a messy exterior, and
in her hate for Louie there is, at any
rate, a grudging understanding.
There they dwell, among her endless
games of patience, the stink of fish
being rendered down for Sam’s money-
saving experiments, buckets of strong
tea, and Niagaras of moral exhortation
and filthy abuse. Of sense of place and
period there is little, but instead we
have a marvellous, microscopic view
of a human tadpole hatchery. What
we see is often comic, but the total
effect is harrowing. “The Man Who
Loved Children” excels as a magic
lantern play of family life, good as
well as bad, where “children would
rush off like water down a sink,” and
whoops of delight from the toolshed
are pierced by demoniac howls from
the bedroom. The young of our species
are nearly indestructible; they can, as
this story reveals, survive even where
deadly violence lies just below the
surface.
Christina Stead handles words with
that abundant sophistication which
scatters brilliance apparently without
any effort; in this she is closer to
Joyce and Dylan Thomas than to, say,
Patrick White. The exchanges she lets
us hear are dialogue only in the dic-
tionary meaning, but, all the same,
there is too much of it. Some chapters
(for instance, the one in which Sam
Pollit travels in Malaya) leave a feel-
ing that they should have been made
into autonomous novels, but they
always lead up to a memorable
climax, and Sam’s homecoming and
the ensuing family reunion repay us
well for his long excursion. Let it be
said that the aunts, cousins, and grand-
parents who drift like a warm rain
across these pages are, every one, in-
teresting additions to her sad, great
zoo.
HEROD
Light is only a place for marking shadows.
Such a coming as they say this is
pokes through the palace with a searching lamp,
threatening with brilliance. Look at Herod’s face.
Threat in the voice of a baby; every hand,
podgy and reaching out among pebbles and toys,
feels for a knife; every infant face
searches behind Herod’s back for ways
to humble him, and they are everywhere,
conspiring by number to hire from him the One
it has been spoken will exact his tribute:
How many infants are there in the town?
the country? all the land? “Call the wise men,
what is that newest rumor from Bethlehem?
Worship has its many forms. Now go,
find the child. I shall acknowledge him.”
No one returns. “So: make me fortresses
of infants’ limbs, see that each male child dies!”
This is the acknowledgement. And there are soldiers
enough to quell his swaddled enemies.
“Their flesh is armor; lace it to shields for me
Let women’s breasts be hurt with yellowing milk,
ignore their howls I must be protected.
Nature is easy: a month to let them sulk
before their men replace these ones I need
to build defences with . . .” And it is done.
But Herod listens still; shadows are crouching,
the dead children squint through every stone,
and his palace points with their bones. Let it be night,
see how the King is wakeful, restless now.
My brother fear moves and has found the way
even to his furthest room, although
there are the guards, the locks, good formulae.
Worship has its old and many forms.
Herod of our fears grows mad and strange,
he tugs the dark around his traitrous limbs:
and God stares at us through his tribute crimes.

DON’T let them die while there
1 are doubts,” read the placards
carried by pickets outside the
White House in the hot summer days
before the execution of Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg in June, 1953. Similar
signs waved over the heads of demon-
strators in New York, London, Paris,
Milan, and a dozen other cities in
Europe and America. In the week
before the Rosenbergs went to the
electric chair in Sing Sing more than
20,000 telegrams urging clemency
poured into the office of President
Eisenhower. It looked like the Sacco
and Vanzetti case all over again. There
was, however, at least one important
difference. The overwhelming majority
of the partisans of Sacco and Vanzetti
were convinced that the obscure little
pair of Italian anarchists were innocent
and that they had been railroaded to
the death house on the wave of the big
Red Scare of the 19205. There was no
such single-minded conviction among
the people who tried in vain to save
the Rosenbergs.
Many of them had little doubt that
the Rosenbergs had, in fact, passed on
information about America’s atomic
bomb project to Soviet agents during
World War 11. They were concerned
not with justice but with mercy. They
could point out that, at the time of the
offence for which the Rosenbergs were
convicted, Russia was the gallant ally
of the Western Powers. They claimed,
with some justification, that the im-
portance of the information handed to
the Russians was grossly inflated by
officials who could not conceive of
Soviet scientists developing their own
bomb without the aid of American
“secrets” filched by traitors and Com-
munist agents. They acknowledged that
the Rosenbergs had had a fair trial
and that the due processes of appeal
had been followed up to the highest
courts in the land. They sought mercy
on the grounds that it was barbaric
to put a couple of misguided idealists
to death. It was also politically inex-
pedient, in view of the massive protests
all round the world, to dignify the
Rosenbergs by martyrdom.
TO others, however, the Rosenbergs
were the innocent victims of a cold-
blooded frame-up, concocted by self-
confessed traitors to save their own
skins and eagerly swallowed by a credu-
lous and over-zealous FBI. Others again
were honest doubters. Maybe the Rosen-
bergs were guilty, but was it safe to
convict them on the testimony of a
sleazy little rat like Harry Gold and
a frightened, perjured weakling like
Ethel Rosenberg’s younger brother,
David Greenglass? (There were also,
of course, the hard-core Communists
and fellow-travellers to whom the guilt
or innocence of the Rosenbergs was of
merely academic interest. Julius and
Ethel were to be presented as lambs
slaughtered on the altar of American
“fascism.”)
The authors of “Invitation To An
Inquest” are firmly dedicated to the
proposition that the Rosenbergs were
victims of a terrible miscarriage of
justice. In the 450 pages of this massive
book they have gathered all the
relevant, and some dubiously relevant,
facts, summarised the proceedings of
the trial in March, 1951, and the num-
erous appeals and delaying actions that
followed, and dug into the backgrounds
of the curious characters involved in
the case. It is not easy reading, or is
its argument entirely convincing. After
reading it I felt that the Rosenbergs
probably were guilty, but I think that
if I’d been on the jury I would have
had enough, though only just enough,
doubt to have voted for an acquittal.
The facts, briefly, were these: When
Klaus Fuchs was arrested in Britain
in 1950 his information made it evident
that American agents had co-operated
with him in passing information to
Russia about Fuchs’ work as a member
of the British team helping in the pro-
duction of America’s first atomic bomb.
With the meagre clues provided, the
FBI roped in Harry Gold, a Phila-
delphia chemist who had been peddling
information about industrial processes
to the Russians since before the war.
Gold led the FBI to David Greenglass,
an ex-soldier who had been stationed
on the bomb development site at Los
Alamos during the war. Greenglass was
the vital witness whose confession set
the FBI on the trail of his brother-in-
law and sister, Julius and Ethel Rosen-
berg. Greenglass claimed to have stolen
drawings and other material and sent
them to the Rosenbergs for transmission
to a Soviet agent in New York. -The
Rosenbergs, when they were arrested,
denied the whole story. They continued
to deny it even when, while they were
awaiting electrocution, it was hinted
to them that they could save their lives
by confessing.
Apart from the admissions of Gold
and Greenglass, the prosecution had not
much to go on. The authors’ contention,,
in bald terms, is that the FBI and high
government officials, convinced that
they had uncovered a dangerous spy
ring, set about creating an atmosphere
of alarm and confusion that (whether
they consciously willed it or not) made
a fair trial for the Rosenbergs almost
impossible. The authors point out that
Senator McCarthy was then in full
rampage and casualties from the Korean
War were mounting. We are asked to
believe that it was this pressure of semi-
hysterical public opinion that sent the
Rosenbergs to the electric chair on
flimsy and tainted evidence. I must say
I do not find this theory really credible.
For two years after the original trial
appeal courts raked over the evidence
and listened to new pleas before de-
ciding not to set aside the jury’s ver-
dict. Whether the sentence should have
been commuted is another matter. A
British judge sentenced Fuchs to 14r
years in prison. It is hard to believe
that the crime of Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg posed a much deadlier threat
to Western security than Fuchs’ treason.
It was a far cry from the shabby
little world of the Rosenbergs and their
confederates to the James Bondish
career of Richard Sorge, another Com-
munist agent in World War 11. Sorge
was one of the most fantastic spies of
the 20th century and it is good to wel-
come the first full-length and factual
account of his almost legendary career.
A fanatical German Communist and
Politburo agent in pre-Nazi days, Sorge
was able to bury his past so successfully
after Hitler came to power that he was
sent to Japan as correspondent of a
German newspaper and for several
years played a hair-raising double game
as a confidant of Nazi diplomats and
high-ranking Japanese officials in Tokyo
while systematically feeding military in-
formation to Moscow. He brought off
his greatest coup by transmitting precise
advance information about Hitler’s in-
vasion of Russia. He also accurately
predicted to the Kremlin that Japan
intended to strike against Britain and
America, instead of launching the
Asiatic war that Stalin feared. “The
Case Of Richard Sorge” is a fascinating
book, worth a dozen spy thrillers.

The Riverina Germans
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Stories of the Riverina. E. O. Schlunke.
Angus & Robertson. $2.75.
THE Australian writer E. O.
Schlunke was a successful Riverina
farmer by day and a social satirist
after hours.
He had a seeing eye for the foibles
of his fellow-men which he depicted
with genuine understanding and a dry
sense of humor, “always catching on the
nail of our national self-consciousness,”
as Clement Semmler aptly expresses it
in his persuasive foreword to this col-
lection of short stories.
Schlunke certainly deserves wider
recognition, which might possibly come
when his novels, particularly “Rosen-
thal,” are at last published in book
form. (All three appeared years ago
as serials in newspapers and magazines,
including one in THE BULLETIN.)
As Mr. Semmler adds, “It is a matter
for some ironical reflection that in all
the clamoring that goes on for the
typical Australian pioneering or outback
novel . . . ‘Rosenthal’ lies buried . . .”
Schlunke was by descent part of that
early migrant group of old Lutheran
Germans driven out of Europe by
religious persecution to settle mainly in
South Australia last century. His
ancestors, instead of growing grapes
and becoming a famous name on a
wine label, crossed the border into
the Riverina and became sheep and
wheat farmers. Schlunke is able to see
life from both sides European and
Australian including the assimilation
of one into the other, and is equally
merciless with both the old and the new.
His story “A Sheep’s-eye View” shows
up man’s stupidity, avarice, and lack of
imagination as it might appear to a per-
ceptive animal being shuttled around
the country at the mercy of speculators.
In its own way, it is as valid an indict-
ment in prose as, for instance, in
another way, Hal Porter’s “Sheep” is
in verse.
“Alfred” is a multiple legpull, a
gentle dig at short-sighted anthropolo-
gists, goody-goody children, and big-
oted pastors who have forgotten the
spirit of religion for the letter. When-
ever Alfred’s father “met a party of
aborigines, he’d give them a sermon in
German,” although he knew they did
not understand a word. It ends in the
manner of the tall story Dal Stivens
used to write, with “saintly” Alfred be-
ing responsible for lightening the skins
of a whole tribe of aborigines to con-
found the studies of later anthropolo-
gists.
The irony of “The Irling,” an ill-
omened Central European will-o’-the-
wisp that mysteriously turns up in the
new world to haunt a superstitious
family, is intensified rather than
watered down by the fact that these
migrants do not even remember any
more how to pronounce the phantom
lights name in coirect German.
For my taste, it is this dark Gothic
thread that runs through these sunlit
pastoral landscapes which gives
Schlunke’s stories their unmistakable
individuality. It is not the ready-made
“Gothics” of the menacing bush with
its natural grotesqueries of flora and
fauna that seem to have fired his
imagination. It is typical for him that
when he brings a monster into his tales,
it is not the huge Diprotodon or any
of those prehistoric animals whose
fossils still lie out in the Dead Heart,
but a small horrific thing of his own
creation • like a gargoyle.
His characters are small people
against a small background; the bush
never seems to have inspired them to
greatness.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Over to McMahon
THE $2 a week basic wage rise neither solves the problems
facing the economic managers in the consumer field nor
sets really serious new ones for the economy as a
whole. The costs of underemployment of labor at present
in Australia are probably greater than those caused by the
wage judgment, and, on the other hand, a return to overtime
working conditions on a large scale would give consumption
a far stronger kick along than the wage rise.
Wage costs are all the more inhibiting to industry when it
has to carry labor not fully employed or when, in the hope
of demand being restored, it hoards hands. Disguised unem-
ployment of this sort and eroded overtime beget caution
in spending, which explains better than anything else why
the Australian economy has been sluggish this year when all
investment stops (except Stock Exchange ones) have been
out. The authorities have a complicated task in this situation
in which many people, notably in retail trade, the motor
industry, consumer durables factories, and fringe activities
are hanging on to their jobs by the skin of their teeth and
a whole lot of others are getting home earlier than usual
from work.
Paramount to their task is keeping effective demand
topped up and getting a sufficiency of it into spending
channels to oil the flow of orders back to industry, without
prejudice to an adequate flow of savings. Then there is the
need to relieve cost pressures on industry to keep it viable
profitwise. And to this is linked a third, to provide the
necessary incentive for private investment. Through its fiscal
and monetary controls, as well as via its übiquitous spending
pursuits, Government has an overriding influence in all these
fields, subject, if you like, only to the dictates of the balance
of payments and the Arbitration Commission. Thanks to a
timely easing of imports demand, striking buoyancy in
exports, and bountiful capital inflow, the balance of payments
can largely be discounted in the present situation. The
Arbitration Commission has said its piece for the year. So
all the cards are now in Mr. McMahon’s hand.
Now knowing the worst on wages, Mr. McMahon’s
preparation of the Budget is the more complicated because,
while effective demand will obviously be boosted, labor of
all sorts becomes more costly as a result of the Arbitration
Commission’s wage findings. In his efforts to keep activity
from falling below its present dampened level, and if possible
to spur it to new heights and revive real growth in the
urban sectors of the economy consonant with the concentra-
tion of population growth there, he can hardly make his
tax concessions as big as otherwise. But at least the Arbitra-
tion Commission’s decision means he will have to do some-
thing special to provide bigger incentives to industry, which
will be looking beyond mere increases in turnovers to get out
of the rut of profitless prosperity and revive its investment
hormones.
The burning question is whether, in its now tightened
straitjacket, industry elects to raise prices. Such a move
would be logical and is perhaps inevitable, but unless con-
sumers revive their buying spirits it could also prove to be
self-defeating, even in the new conditions of higher personal
incomes resulting from the wages increase and, looking ahead
to the Budget, say, tax concessions and higher pensions.
It would also reverberate on the competitiveness of primary
producers and Australian exports. The Deputy-Secretary of
MEN AND MATTERS
IN Bridge Street, between Pitt and
George Streets, five out of seven
buildings in the north side are
modern glasshouses. But across the way
at No. 7, nothing much changes. In
Burns Philp’s Victorian building the
liftman still pulls on the rope to hoist
fl 0 S or e der y P assen § ers from floor t 0
But last week there was a change.
Mr. Joseph Mitchell retired from the
r . ri ~r
general managership after 75 years
with the company and 24 years as G.M
to give way to young Mr Percy P. W
Black, who has been with the firm all
his working life, 50 years.
Mr. Black graduated in economics
at Sydney University before World War
I, then joined Burns Philp. An early
job as purser on one of the company’s
island vessels took him to all the is-
lands where Burns Philp operates. He
learned the island trading side of the
business well, but in recent years he
has devoted more time to the overall
administration. He has been a director
of both Burns Philp and Bums Philp
(South Seas) for some 20 years. A son,
C. T. Black, is in the South Seas sec-
tion of the business.
The man Mr. Black replaces
was born in Picton in 1874 and began
work as a junior clerk in Burns Philp
a few weeks before his 17th birthday.
Four years later he was a branch mana-
ger and in 1914 became manager for
the Pacific Islands.
After a spell in San
Francisco and ten
years as General
Inspector, he be-
came a director in
1929 and general
manager in 1942.
Mr. M i t chell
held the reins until
he was 92, so, as
far as Burns Philp
is concerned, the septuagenarian Mr.
Black, who is just now moving into the
top job at an age when most men
have retired, seems to face a long
innings.
Burns Philp has had a respect for
maturity that is evidenced in the
composition of its board of directors.
The chairman, Mr. James Burns (son
of the first chairman, Sir James), is
over 80 and gives no indication of
handing over to his 37-year-old son,
James.
NOT all companies have the same
directorial approach to senior
citizens as Burns Philp. Around at
Mercantile Credits 72 is the finishing
rather than starting age for men at the
top.
It is appropriate that “Jock” Thyne
Reid should assume the chairman’s
seat in Mercantile Credit Ltd.’s board
room, vacated by D. Chisholm
P. T. W. Black
Joseph Mitchell
J. T. Reid
Cameron; it was his father, Andrew
Reid, who helped Mercantile’s founder,
D. F. P. Roth, get the company off the
ground 31 years ago.
Mercantile Credits has always been
considered an associate member of the
James Hardie stable, which has been
controlled by the Reid family for fifty-
odd years. Jock Reid is chairman of all
the Hardie companies, and lives in
Melbourne although their operations,
like Mercantile Credits, are centred in
Sydney.
Mr. Roth, who was managing direc-
tor of Mercantile Credits until 1959,
retired from the board last year, hav-
ing reached the age of 72. Mr.
Cameron, who was secretary of the
Hardie group for years, will remain a
director of Mercantile until the annual
meeting at the end of September, but
will not seek reappointment at the elec-
tion of directors.


the Department of Trade underlined the dangers in these
directions when he addressed the Victorian Division of the
Australian Primary Producers’ Union last week.
The wage increase certainly narrows the Treasurer’s room
for a general economic manoeuvre on the fiscal front, where
already he is by no means out of the wood on defence
scores, is more heavily committed to the States than last
year, and has now to write the Arbitration Commission’s
findings into the Government’s own wage bills. Will he then
turn to interest rate policy to assist the stimulating, process?
Ludwig's Way with Iron
A NEWS break that was front page the following day
appeared in the “West Australian” last week tucked
away on page 26 in a three-inch double-column ad,
certainly the most untimely advertisement of 1966. Sentinel
Mining Co. Incorporated was calling for a chief project
engineer because “the company is developing its high-grade
iron ore deposits in the north-west of West Australia. Initial
costs of the project will be 30 million dollars, including rail-
way and port within expansion plans totalling 60 to 80
million dollars contemplated within ten years.”
This was how Western Australians learnt of a new and
pertinent development in the Pilbara region and how it put
the cat among the pigeons! For Sentinel is the New York
incorporated mining subsidiary of American multi-millionaire
Daniel K. Ludwig, the world’s biggest individual ship-owner,
whose interest in the West was procured three years ago by
Lang Hancock, the man who started the iron ore boom.
Ludwig plans to operate a 30 million ton ore body at
Nimingarra, ten miles east of Port Hedland. Instead of
choosing to get the ore out through Hedland he intends to
create his own open seaport on Ninety Mile Beach, 45 miles
from the mine and 140 miles up the coast from Hedland.
This is a humiliating slap in the face for the Hedland scheme
at a crucial time.
Amax and Cleveland Cliffs, of the U.S., have gone along
to the Japanese with Australia’s CSR and BHP to plead
the virtues of the Government-backed rationalisation. Sentinel
has told the Government they prefer their open seaport
because it promises to accommodate ships of virtually limit-
less tonnage the very attribute Hedland critics say this
port lacks (Bulletin, June 25).
There were some terse things said at official level about
Sentinel’s inadvertent news leak and it was stressed that the
scheme was only at the negotiating stage. But with three
million dollars already spent, Sentinel is now planning a
nine months’ feasibility study and has hopes of cracking the
difficult European market. Port Hedland aside, Sentinel’s
news was good news. It has tied up most of the area’s
manganese leases and plans to export ferrous manganese as
well as hematite up-graded to a type of sponge iron in a
thermal process. This will boost the iron content from about
64 to 80 percent or more and means vast capital works to
get the secondary processes under way. The need for thermal
energy might well bring about the long-awaited marriage of
north-west iron and north-west oil or natural gas
What to do with Debtors
AVOIDING bad debts is only half the debtor problem
that has caused such turmoil in Australian business
in the past few years; mismanagement of good ones
can also bring heavy losses. Not only do good debts turn
into bad ones if debtors are not managed adequately, but
there can be heavy losses involved in unnecessary financing
of debtors for too long.
So the Australian Institute of Management in Sydney is
aiming at improving the level of understanding of the tech-
niques of management of trade debtors by running a one-dav
symposium on July 25 called “What To Do With Debtors.”
Under the chairmanship of Mr. G. L. Carter, general man-
ager of the Australian Guarantee Corporation, businessmen
will discuss whether the right way to manage their trade
debtors is to raise a bank loan against them, discount them
as commercial bills, factor them, or insure them.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Arbitration Commission
unanimously awarded a $2 a week basic wage increase,
rejected the employers’ total wage concept, and would
not make a margins award “at this time” (see J. C.
Horsfall’s comments on page 50).
The 1965-66 Federal Budget turned out “almost
precisely balanced in terms of cash,” the Treasurer, Mr.
W. McMahon, announced last week; estimates had been
for a $38.8 million surplus. Actual Commonwealth
spendings were $251.1 million above receipts, so $251.8
million net loan raisings helped achieve the balance . . .
A 35-year term goes into the latest loan, the first for
1966-67; its full target is $BO million.
June gave a second successive monthly advance of
exports over imports, this time by $30.8 million.
For the markets: Waiting upon and then
adjusting to the basic wage decision kept Australian
share markets pretty sedate, although, at the end, not
much real adjustment proved necessary. More than the
immediate wage prospect, which was reasonably well
discounted on rumor, the Budget begins to loom ahead
of investors. They will mostly resolve to hold prices
fairly firm, much as these now stand.
Numerous disturbances have had to be taken more
seriously by London possibly higher Bank Rate and
credit restrictions, sterling’s variability, and a fall in
gold reserves. Good equities don’t move much; even
steels show no positive trend . . . Wall Street’s word is
“mixed,” in the shadow of tighter money (prime bor-
rowing rates are up). Volumes look unremarkable.
For companies : Investment bankers move
swiftly these days. Almost sooner than formed, Sydney-
based Martin Corporation put out an offer for F. W.
Williams Holdings at $4.25 a share, also giving Wil-
liams’ shareholders an opportunity to purchase their
company’s ACI parcel at $5.30 a share. Martin brings
together Mutual Credits Ltd., Mutual Acceptance Co.,
United Dominions Corporation, sharebroker A. B. S.
White, and a group of U.K. bankers.
Concrete Industries (Monier) has had three claims
totalling $4.46 million rejected by the U.S. Navy; they
apply to losses on the North West Cape radio base
and an appeal will be heard by a special authority
. . . On the dismal side, too, Sydney motor distributor
John A. Gilbert Holdings cut dividend back from 15
to 12J percent after an 18.5 percent profit drop.
Sure relief comes from the miners. First, Mount
Isa’s production year closed with record output of
all its metals and sales valued at more than $7O million
. . . Then Mount Morgan has hit peak gold outputs,
of higher grade, although copper is down on lower
ore throughputs . . . Lake View and Star Ltd. can now
domicile itself in Australia . . . Not so New Broken Hill.
Quarrymaster Farley and Lewers leads in a spate of
issues, one-for-eight at par to raise $105,000 . . . Queens-
lander Sargeants Engineering wants $727,000 through
a one-for-two at 50 percent premium, after a lower
nine month’s profit and prospective post-issue dividend
down from 15 to percent . . . Peters Ice Cream
(W.A.) proposes to finance expansion by issuing 50 cent
shares at a 30 cent premium, one-for-eight.
Large regional shopping centres are planned by Myer
Emporium-G. J. Coles (Doncaster, Vic.) and David
Jones (Mount Gravatt, Queensland) . . . BHP has sold
100,000 tons of re-roll billets to Pakistan . . . Melbourne
printer Wilke will handle the long-awaited South Pacific
edition of “Life” . . . Sweetmaker Darrell Lea proposes
to list after a public, premium issue.

A Year for the Workers
SO much for the total wage concept
—for the time being. The whole
area of margins has been thrown
wide open, as Mr. R. J. Hawke was
pleased to say on the steps of the Arbi-
tration Commission last Friday, when a
wages decision was announced by Mr.
Justice Wright giving metal trades
workers an immediate $2 increase in the
basic wage, up to $4 a week extra for
lower classification employees in the
industry, and reserving judgment on the
other applications recently heard by the
Commission.
I am not surprised or sorry. However
much sense a total wage makes to em-
ployers as a means of restraining wage
increases, it has always seemed un-
realistic for the Commission to toy
with the concept without having the
jurisdiction to implement an incomes
policy. On the other hand, concurrent
hearings of basic wage and margins
applications, related as they are to the
division of the same available cake, must
be commended. It would be a pity if,
as seems to be in prospect, the old
union game of leapfrogging basic wage
and margins cases is to be resumed.
Seeking consolation for this reverse,
the National Employers’ Policy Com-
mittee clutched at the judgments’ straw
that the Commission decided in prin-
ciple to write basic wage rates out of
awards. This, it commented, means the
Commission accepts the reality of the
position “when the basic wage finally
disappears from awards it will simplify
wage-fixing procedures.” In the interim
it would appear the unions have all to
play for, but there may be more than
meets the eye in the Commission’s de-
cision (not solicited by either of the
parties) to hold an investigation into
margins in the metal trades on a work-
value basis. This is being regarded with
some suspicion by both unions and em-
ployers. It could be the first stage in
a process to eliminate basic wage hear-
ings as such.
This is not to say, of course, that the
Commission would swing in favor of
the automatic productivity approach
now being adopted by the employers. It
has always been more at ease ruling by
thumb and horse-sense. It listens
patiently to Mr. Robinson’s learned argu-
ments and studies the theorists. But it
seems to give these the same stiff-upper-
lip treatment it does to Mr. Hawke’s
tireless journeys through the arguments
for adjusting wages automatically to
changes in the cost of living, which it
has once again rejected. Going on horse-
sense it is quite remarkable that in any
given year you can tell almost to the
nearest shilling what conclusions the
Commission will come to on wage in-
creases. This year has been no excep-
tion (the bets at the Trades Hall were
all near the mark).
For the moment, both for employers
and employees, the basic wage remains
very much alive. If wage-earners wel-
comed the increase in it as being as
big in money value as any in the past,
it should be remembered that two
dollars today is worth not much more
than half the £1 increase in 1950 was
in terms of purchasing power. How-
ever, judging by the slow performance
of retail sales this last year, the rise is
timely from their viewpoint if not for
employers. The National Employers’
Policy Committee estimates the latter
will have to pay out an additional $2BO
million in wages as a result. Its office
in Melbourne told me this sum is be-
yond all estimates of the economy’s
capacity to pay. We will have to wait
and see whether this is so. But at any
rate, with consumer prices now fairly
stable and the volume of retail sales
recessed, the injection of the additional
spending power should be absorbed.
QBVIOUSLY the urgency of stimulat-
ing the economy seen in Canberra and
even in industry had a lot to do with the
Commission’s decision not to delay any
longer in giving the increase. Yet
throughout the hearings one always had
the feeling, as THE BULLETIN put it
two months ago, that this would be a
year for the workers.
This year’s show was prolonged, of
course, by Mr. Hawke’s calling of the
Vernon Committee. These gentlemen
provided a novel spark of interest,
although, frankly, I thought their evi-
dence was pretty useless to the unions’
case, because only Professor Karmel, of
the three appearing, could be reckoned
as being theoretically conversant with
the points Mr. Hawke was attempting to
prove; even he seemed to be flounder-
ing a bit, caught as it were on the shift-
ing grounds of his own views, par-
ticularly about the effect of restrictive
practices on pricing. In any case, it i?
probable that any benefit the unions
gained from their interrogation was
undone by Mr. Robinson’s late citing
of an article from Dr. Hall, published
by the “Financial Review,” which de-
bunked the main assumption Hawke was
working on.


PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Bright Hopes on Trade
THE financial year has closed and
the first statistics for it are flow-
ing in. Foreign trade figures are
the first and they are far brighter than
anyone could have hoped for: a trade
deficit of only $229m. Certainly the
Government did not expect anything
nearly as good as this. They do not
publish their forecasts, and they are
very hesitant to talk about them.
Nevertheless, it is possible to guess
quite accurately what they must have
been.
In the last Budget the Treasurer
put down a figure of s2B7m. for Cus-
toms revenue for 1965-66; assuming
that this was expected to remain a
constant proportion of the value of
total imports, a figure of $3lOO m.
would have been implied. This fits
in with the statement in the 1965 pre-
Budget White Paper that imports would
rise again, though by less than the
ss3om. increase which 1964-65 saw.
As it turned out, in the financial year
just ended imports were $2932m.,
marginally higher than in 1964-65.
Treasury was proved over-pessimistic
to the tune of sl7om. on account of
imports.
It was also too pessimistic about
exports and in the 1965 Survey thought
they would be “somewhat lower,” down,
say, sBom. to $2620m. The outcome for
1965-66 was in fact somewhat higher
with earnings lifting by s7om. As a
result, the deficit was hardly more than
half of the s4Bom. which Treasury
must have expected.
In all fairness it must be recalled
that Treasury were nowhere near as
gloomy as some. From the Trade De-
partment-Chamber of Manufactures
buildings a mile to the east of West
Block there were mutterings about a
trade deficit of $600m., $700m., and
even sBoom. And, of course, there were
demands for reintroduction of import
controls.
Last year’s excessive anxiety almost
certainly did strengthen the hand of
those in the Government who wanted
more tariff protection and hence just
the diversion of resources the Trea-
sury mentioned. And it also contri-
buted to economic policies being more
restrictive than they need have been.
The prospects are in fact good
s3ooom. does not seem an unreason-
able figure for export income.
Imports, on the other hand, are unlikely
to grow beyond the $2932m. in the
financial year just ended; the general
growth of imports being offset by falling
inflows of plant and equipment.
Through overlooking a footnote in a
statistical release, I did the Treasury
an injustice last week. Figures I quoted
for imports of capital goods for 1964-
65 were, in fact, not directly compar-
able with those for the year before.
(The adoption of the new Brussells
classification has upset things.) But
comparable figures for the month of
’May show sl3lm. against last year’s
$162m.: Enough to substantiate the
charge that the Treasury made a
mistake in the White Paper, although
it was, however, less serious than I had
thought.
Traffic across the Tasman
By CROESUS
IN recently giving its approval to the Australia-New Zealand trade agreement,
GATT made two provisions: one, that the agreement must be extended next
year; the other that within a “reasonable” period, say ten to 15 years, sub-
stantially all transtasman trade must be covered.
Maybe we shouldn’t take these two
provisos all that seriously in them-
selves. GATT is notoriously pompous
and is probably happier than it admits
that N.Z. and Australia are getting
together on trade. But in unison with
New Zealand we should exert every
effort to get even closer together and
put more flesh and blood into what is
not much more than a skeleton of an
agreement.
In Wellington recently, Professor F.
W. Holmes, of Victoria University,
underlined the need for extending the
agreement. If, he said, the initial list
of items (covering only 60 percent of
cross trade) subject to its provisions,
with all its safeguards, represented the
end of the road of agreement, then one
could not claim that any significant
change had occurred in trading and
economic relationships between the two
countries. On the other hand, he con-
tinued, if, as seems more reasonable,
one views the arrangement as the be-
ginning of a road co-operative action
to further the development of the two
countries, it must be regarded as a
document of considerable political and
economic significance.
The question is whether the promis-
ing beginning will lead on to a real free
trade area and possibly economic in-
tegration between the two countries. One
should not necessarily assume that it
will. A few months ago, we saw in the
Australian Parliament’s debate on tariff
reductions provided for in the present
agreement on a handful of our prim-
ary products pig meats, cheddar
cheese, peas, and beans what a cloud
of dust can be raised by affected local
interests, even when relatively small
trade is involved. Recently I have been
sampling N.Z. industrial opinion on the
prospect of increasing competition from
our manufactures. It doesn’t encourage
the hope of the agreement being
widened without a stream of New Zeal-
and tears.
New Zealand industrialists generally
don’t seem to think Australia has given
much away in the new agreement, ex-
cept on forest products. Even there,
while our concessions give N.Z. the go-
ahead for big expansion of these and
allied industries, it is beyond the cap-
acity of Australia’s forest products in-
dustry now or in the future to meet
envisaged increases in local demand,
whereas N.Z. has.the production pot-
ential to do so on more favorable terms
than available to us elsewhere. (Aus-
tralia’s annual consumption of timber
and forest products is estimated to rise
from a present 500 million cubic feet
a year to more than 1100 million cubic
feet by the end of the century.)
JN any case, New Zealanders say, the
the strong growth in Australia’s forest
products output (particularly pulp) in
recent years would not fit comfortably
into the pattern of industrial rationalis-
ation which would necessarily emerge as
the disposition of resources was ad-
justed to conform with relative costs of
production of industries in the two
countries, under a full free trade area.
(In the three years to June, 1965,
Australian pulp output rose 22 percent,
which compares with a 33 percent in-
crease in N.Z., in the three years to
December, 1964.)
In N.Z. the same argument is ap-
plied and much more loudly to our
dairy industry. A visitor to N.Z. for-
bears to retort that most of N.Z. in-
dustry not engaged merely in process-
ing local foodstuffs and raw materials
would also possibly fall victim to the
economic rationalisation processes re-
quired in a customs union. The fears of
N.Z. manufacturers are real enough.
Economists in the Dominion see these
fears, and the background to them, as
the main obstacle to a wide extension
of the agreement. Holmes, for instance,
says it “should be a matter of national
concern that, at present, so few New
Zealand manufacturers seem prepared
to contemplate competition on equal
terms with their Australian counter-
parts, let alone to press for free entry
for their products to the Australian
market under the agreement. Such a
situation demands a thorough investi-
gation of the reasons for the manu-
facturers’ fears, with a view to devising
methods of increasing productivity or
lowering relative production costs in
New Zealand.”
In Holmes’ view these methods could
well include a change in the structure
of taxation, designed to reduce com-
pany tax or to provide greater incen-

tives for production or exports. (The
N.Z. Government announced a general
taxation inquiry in its latest Budget.)
Also, he thinks Government regulations
and the import licensing system could
be reviewed to ensure that they were
not unduly prejudicing the competitive
ability of the more efficient New Zeal-
and enterprises. (This would be difficult
in the current strained reserves situ-
ation.) Again, in its fiscal and credit
policies, he believes the Government
should pay more attention to the
avoidance of actual labour shortages
and in seeing that the country’s manu-
facturing development is not prejudiced
by unnecessary instability in domestic
demand and in the supply of capital
and material.
Without needing to mention the
antics, say, of the dairying industry
here, it is clear that, with vested in-
terests standing to be affected on both
sides of the Tasman taking a precious
line, efforts to widen the trade agree-
ments and further the cause of eco-
nomic integration are not likely to get
very far. The full implications of eco-
nomic rationalisation implicit in a
wide extension of the trade agreement
are, as it were, too threatening for those
likely to be most affected.
The high recent mobility of labor
and industry between European
industrialised countries has surprised
economists (as it has anybody used
to the highly charged nationalist cli-
mate in Europe pre-war, and still does
most Britons faced with the prospect
of joining the Common Market), but
it is a reality. This is not to say that,
for all the many common character-
istics shared by the Australian and New
Zealand communities, integration is
going to be achieved with the same
speed and facility in this part of the
world, unless, that is, N.Z. is prepared
to sacrifice much of its secondary in-
dustry for the cause.
JT took N.Z. an age to grasp the nettle
of industrialisation and, judging
by the muddles in establishing glass
and synthetic fibres industries there in
recent times, the effort has been costly.
Not in all directions, of course. Be-
cause in textiles and oil refining,
efficiency is high even by world
standards and, within the limits imposed
by a small home market, engineering,
plastics, electrical appliances, motor
assembly, and some other industries
are reasonably viable behind a high
tariff wall and tight import and ex-
change controls.
But the important point for this
discussion is that these industries exist
and others like steel (near Auckland)
are in the making. They provide a
balance to the otherwise rurally
oriented and producer-board-ridden
economy. They are the employment
background to urban population expan-
sion, not only in cities like Auckland,
Wellington, and Christchurch but also
in the provincial centres, like the fast
growing Hamilton and Nelson, lately
being sprinkled with more factories.
In N.Z. eyes, an economic union with
Australia would jeopardise this back-
ground to national expansion simply
' because most of N.Z. industrial firms
would find great difficulty in meeting
competition from their more efficient
counterparts in Australia. The result,
as envisaged, could be a drift of
capital and labor from N.Z. to Aus-
tralia. In any event, N.Z. secondary
industry growth would be retarded and
the country thrown back on specialised
rural industry. There would be much
more to it than the otherwise admirable
principle of resources rationalisation.
An Auckland businessman put it to
me: “The only real assets we have are
grass and scenery,” which may exag-
gerate the point once made by Sir
Keith Hancock that “sheep are bad
populators.”
N.Z. is growing increasingly con-
scious that (pace its myopic attitudes
toward importing overseas capital) the
expansion, and even the present via-
bility of its fragile secondary industry,
stands or falls on the success achieved
by its three main grass-nurtured rural
exports dairy produce, meat, and
wool in bringing in adequate
foreign exchange to pay for industry’s
required imports of plant, equipment,
raw materials, and components (not
to speak of consumer goods required
to supplement inadequate local pro-
duction). The logistics of this were
explained in Parliament recently by the
PM, Mr. Holyoake, when, before the
British seamen’s strike ended, he gave
reassurances that, while the strike posed
a threat to industrial activity by hold-
ing up essential imports (about two-
fifths of imports come from Britain),
industry’s stocks of raw materials were
adequate to keep it going for some
time. In these near-dire circumstances
it was a nice twist when some N.Z.
manufacturers admitted they were look-
ing to Australia as an alternative source
of supplies to keep their factories
going.
N.Z. is not quite over the hurdle
raised by the British seamen’s strike
yet. A tough balance-of-payments
battle lies ahead. Even so a crisis will
probably be averted and the need to
look to Australia shelved. If so, the
next event likely to turn N.Z. heads
toward the extension of economic co-
operation with Australia could be a
more concerted move by Britain to
join the Common Market. Yet, in the
Dominion, one finds cfimplacency borne
of blind faith that N.Z. exports to
Britain, which bring in most of its
foreign exchange, will somehow be
looked after by “the mother country.”
Only if this faith proves unfounded
would one really expect the Dominion
to make a concerted move to put real
substance into the trade agreement
and move much closer economically to
Australia.

A Bad "Sell" in Frankfurt
How not to attract European investment
By J. G. HARDY
AUSTRALIA has not done very
well in arousing European
interest in investment here. After
seeing how Australia was “sold” by its
official representatives to German busi-
nessmen at a day-long seminar near
Frankfurt last month, I know why.
The banking house of George Flauck
and Sohn, founded in 1673, had invited
about 50 top-ranking German indus-
trialists and financiers for a day-long
affair with lunch, drinks, and dinner at
the Koenigstein, a beautiful resort 13
miles from the city. The subject: Invest-
ing in Australia. The London branch
of the Commercial Bank of Australia
Ltd. was a co-sponsor, but the lion’s
share of preparations, organisation, and
costs were shouldered by the German
bankers, who drew an audience which
looked very much like a “Who’s- Who
in German Business.”
When one of the partners whom I
had known for a number of years in-
vited me to attend I accepted with
some trepidation, remembering the very
poor performance by Australia last
year during the “Australia Day” organ-
ised by the Hanover Fair. There, at
least five of the Australian States had
trotted out their claims of their home
parishes so crudely that the Germans
could not help but laugh at the per-
formance.
At Frankfurt it was even worse. In
front of every chair was a small
mountain of books, booklets, and leaflets
provided by the States, in quantities
which stood in reverse ratio to their
respective sizes. The first speaker for
Australia was the Senior Trade Com-
missioner with the Australian Embassy
in Bonn, whose high abilities do not
include public speaking. It was, un-
fortunately, not only an uninspiring
address but was weak on figures also.
After this not very promising be-
ginning the representatives of the six
States got up and did exactly what
they had done the year before in
Hanover. The Agent-General for South
Australia tried to break the pattern,
but the speakers before him forced him
more or less into the same rut. Four
times I heard the phrase “And we have
gas, too.” One speaker really said:
“Regardless of what the representatives
of the other States have mentioned,
my State can do as well, if not better,
for foreign investors.” The Germans
rewarded every “over-bid” with laugh-
ter.
It was a great comedy success. But
can Australia really afford to play such
a magnificent chance just for laughs?
Can we afford to treat such a generous
opportunity with a performance which
must be called silly, discourteous, and
dishonest?
Four hours is little time enough to
do justice to Australia as a country
for safe and rewarding investments. It
is therefore silly to insist on talking
about this or that little advantage in this
or that corner of Australia, instead of
banding together and acting as Austra-
lians for Australia. The speakers could
have split, say, 12 topics among the six
of them and given the listeners a bal-
anced picture which would have been
of value to them. It also seems silly
to delegate an English P.R. man, who
pronounced Melbourne the way Queen
Victoria called her Prime Minister in
1837, as the representative of Victoria.
still, Australia gave a discour-
teous performance. It was Aus-
tralia’s duty as guest to cater for those
listeners who did not master English and
its Australian versions. If we really have
nobody who can speak to prospective
investors in their own language in their
own country, at least the many technical
terms in the fields of finance, tariffs,
and law should have been mentioned
in sufficient translation to make them
perfectly clear. The quoting of dis-
tances, temperatures, and monetary
values in miles, Fahrenheit, or Austra-
lian dollars does not convey anything
to other nationals in a speech when
there is no time for mental conversions.
Worst of all, the Australian approach
led to a dishonest treatment of the
theme. Surely a prospective investor
should not only be subjected to un-
realistic attempts to gild the lily; he
is as much entitled to hear something
of the drawbacks and difficulties.
Although little time was left for ad-
dresses by “the other side,” a few very
interesting points were raised by three
German speakers during question time.
There were complaints about lack of
long-term finance for foreign com-
panies, the withholding tax on licence
fees, and, of course, the application of
the by-laws within the customs tariff.
The lack of a double taxation agree-
ment between Australia and Germany
was seen as a serious hindrance, es-
pecially in conjunction with the Aus-
tralian withholding tax. Fortunately
enough, this hurdle should soon dis-
appear, as Australia has submitted a
draft treaty to Bonn. Negotiations are
to start in January, 1967.
Mention was also made of the in-
ability of German banks to open
branches in Australia, yet the point was
not pressed too hard. More interesting
seemed to be a question whether con-
ditions in Australia would permit com-
petitive exports to Asia in order to
make up for the limited home market.
The inquiry found all Australian repre-
sentatives completely unprepared.

Moving into Hire Purchase
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
THE statistics may not indicate it,
but things are going very well
indeed for the better hire-purchase
companies. Despite a modest rise of only
about four percent in outstandings and
the tough times for motors, most com-
panies have been doing better business
that brings better profits.
And the stockmarket agrees. Since
hitting a low of about 470 in March,
the “other finance” section of the Syd-
ney share price index has jumped up
to well over the 500 mark—and accord-
ing to the Chartist is in a clearly upward
trend.
So the fact that most good finance
company shares are near their best for
the year should be no discouragement
to investment, I’ve been a fan of Aus-
tralian Guarantee Corporation in recent
years and the market is putting AGC
far ahead of most of its competitors
(except Associated Securities), lowering
its dividend yield to only five percent,
which is relatively low for this industry.
AGC’s result for the year to June will
presumably continue the upward trend
set by the 17 percent rise in half-year
profits.
leading broking
house has decided that it is
time for its clients to move back
into hire-purchase shares. Three com-
panies are recommended: Custom
Credit (because it appears to be on
the way to regaining some of the
market status lost in recent years),
General Credits (because it seems prices
can only improve from the current low-
level as the company re-establishes its
image in the market), and lAC Hold-
ings (safe buying for income at present,
with growth prospects in the medium
to long term). The circular points out
that the improvement expected from
hire-purchase companies following the
release of 1964-65 results has been con-
firmed by interim reports for the first
half of 1965-66.
Custom Credit earned 13.2 percent
on capital in 1964-65 and profits gained
21.7 percent in the first six months of
1965-66. The broker says this reflects a
consolidation in the business over recent
years, and an emphasis on quality of
i oans rather than quantity, as well as
buoyant conditions for the whole indus-
try. At 81 cents, the 50 cent shares have
recovered from their year low of 62
cen ts and, yielding 6.2 percent from the
dividend, appear to be very safe buying,
General Credits is described as well
along the path of recovery but still a
little low in the market. The 22 percent
profit rise in the year to April 30 last
gave a one-and-a-half times cover to
the 8 percent dividend, which yields
6.9 percent from the 59 cent market
price. The broker feels this low price
may be explained by the fact that the
market has not yet fully forgiven the
company for omitting dividend in 1962.
But, the circular says, the cautious
growth in dividend rate since is indi-
cative of the careful rebuilding of the
company’s finances under the watchful
eye of the associated bank. It would
The Chartist says:
SWAN BREWERY could be about to resume an upward trend. The chart
reveals an impressive performance as this stock followed a 30 percent uptrend
from the beginning of 1961 until early 1965, when a decline to a low point
of $2.20 followed the break in trend. During the past 12 months the stock has
formed a consolidation pattern between the $2.20 and $2.50 levels, which suggests
a rise to approximately $3.30 eventually. An ascending triangle which has been
under construction since March of this year now shows signs of breaking topside;
any rise above $2.55 on high volume would be considered a breakout from the
congestion area and could be followed by a fast rise to about the $2.80 level,,
where resistance would be encountered. Last sale price on 5/7/’66, $2.50,

seem prices must improve with the re-
establishment of market image.
The 6.8 percent yield on lAC shares
is considered high enough to underpin
the 90 cent market price. The year to
December 31 last produced a 19.2 per-
cent earning rate and the final dividend
indicated a higher payout of 12 percent
for 1966. Although the volume of busi-
ness was affected by sluggish market
sales in the latest March quarter, the
broker considers the stock safe buying
for income purposes and sees growth
prospects in the medium to long term.
I’VE not been a real fan of the Gibson
Kelite empire ever since the com-
pany complained a couple of years
ago when I commented on its unnerving
propensity to diversify. The fuss it made
convinced me that something must have
been wrong with one of its diversifica-
tions. Last week we found out what it
was.
Directors announced last week that
a loss by the OSCO hot water engineer-
ing subsidiary had brought the first re-
duction in profit for Gibson Kelite in
its six-year listed history.
Since the group floated in 1960 there
has been scarcely any mention of
OSCO’s operations; over the last two or
three years it has been hard to find
even a mention of the subsidiary’s name,
except as listed in the annual reports.
The reason for this reticence appears to
be that OSCO’s returns have been
below average “for some time” a fact
that Mr. Victor Gibson has now re-
vealed for the first time.
Yet Gibson Kelite was one of those
companies which had worked hard to
create the impression of frankness in its
dealings with shareholders. Its annual
meetings were well run and most in-
formative (at least for those parts of
the company that directors wanted to
be informative about), and were worth
attending if only for the party that was
turned on afterwards. When a problem
like OSCO emerges suddenly from a
company which had been uninformative
about its operations it is bad enough;
when it emerges from behind a facade
of frankness, then the board can expect
to end up in hot water.
In any event, OSCO has now been
sold for an undisclosed amount of cash
and an undisclosed number of shares
following its undisclosed loss but
Mr. Victor Gibson has assured share-
holders that this sale was “on a basis
satisfactory to the group.” The shares
are now around their lowest level for
years.
THE newly formed Hong Kong-
controlled food groups Ballantyne
Holdings and Asian Food Indus-
tries (see 8., July 9) seem to have been
defeated on their first tactical move into
Victoria’s dairying industry. Ballantyne
is the sole agent for produce from the
Kurumburra Co-operative, which was
planning to take over a co-operative
operating from Leongatha. The two
then planned to move in on the Dum-
balk Co-operative to form Victoria’s
biggest dairy co-operative. Presumably,
Ballantyne would have had the sole
rights to produce from all three.
However, Dumbalk shareholders had
been receiving overtures from the
Murray-Goulburn Co-operative Ltd.
and, possibly fearing the worst if the
Hong Kong interests gained too strong
a hold, produced a colossal 85 percent
acceptance to Murray-Goulburn’s offer
within five days of it being posted. Now
the merged Murray-Goulburn-Dumbalk
group will take the title of the biggest
dairying co-operative in Victoria, so
Ballantyne’s hopes have been defeated
on more than one count. However, with
all that Hong Kong cash behind it, it
will no doubt be considering acquisition
of the newly merged group before long.
Murray-Goulburn-Dumbalk, though vic-
tors for the moment, may find it hard
to escape the inevitable.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
What Fate for Coffee's?
GENERAL FOODS CORPORA-
TION of the U.S. has been nib-
bling at Cottee’s Ltd. for over
four months now. Originally, it was in
terms of “commercial collaboration,”
but this has developed to takeover
talks. Rumor has it that the offer will
be a partial takeover, perhaps 65 per-
cent of the 3,740,000 50c shares.
What would General Foods have to
offer Cottee’s that Cottee’s could not
do for itself? Genera Foods already has
more than a footho d in t is coun ry
since it bought Parsons from Associa-
ted Rural Industries Ltd. in 196 .
The U.S. company introduced more
than $2.2m. of new capital for expan-
sion of the Liverpool plant, which now
makes Maxwell House and Cafe Royal
coffee, as well as Parsons saline, corn-
flour, custard powder, John Bull and
One Minute oats, bird food, etc.
In 1965, Cottee’s shareholders were
asked for fresh capital for the first
time in 15 years. The 75c premium
on the 50c shares was no hardship to
shareholders, who had received a one-
for-four bonus in 1962, and a* one-for-
two in 1959. The issue raised almost
$400,000. The company would have no
trouble in raising more equity capital
or going to the fixed interest market,
if it needed funds for development,
Cottee’s has been a most successful
business, originating in 1927 to develop
the passionfruit industry. Today, 60
percent of its turnover is in foods, 40
percent in soft drinks. If sales of
Cottee drinks by the 80 or so franchise
operators were taken into account, the
rat T io w ° ul , d be ™ r « ! ike
In tha last financlal . ,4 e
pany set up a Kenya subsidiary (65
F px ' owned f to prOC( / ss and market the
not vel y wed known passionfruit on
British and European markets . It
already has similar operations in Fiji
and New Guinea,
The eas i n g Q f the price war in soft
drinks and the better seasonal con-
ditions are probably the main reason for
the no t e d improvement in Cottee’s
results in the year to March, for they
had been a major factor in an only
moderate net profit progression in the
previous three years,
Cottee’s moved into the developing
frozen foods business in 1961 by ac-
quiring Cahills Quick Freezers Ltd.
In the 1965 accounts directors were
rather self-congratulatory that an Aus-
tralian-owned company _ was able to
meet and contain “undiminished and
skilful competition.” What has hap-
pened in the last year to make the
board, dominated by the Cottee family,
listen to overseas overtures? After all,
they have been evading them for 15
years, according to their own statement
a few months ago.
Life in the food trade has been very
competitive, but Cottee’s ability to
handle it is evident from the 27.5 p.c.
advance in profit last year, even though
Kenya Fruit Processors Ltd. was
probably a drag on the group. Profit
was $550,835, before appropriating
$40,000 for stock fluctuations and writ-
ing off goodwill.
The “gross profit” figures in the ac-
companying table give the best idea
of steady progression by the company.
The generous 15 p.c. dividend has been
maintained since 1953, undiminished by
subsequent bonus and cash issues.
Stocks increased from sl.sm. to
s2.om. and debtors from sl.lm. to
sl.3m. over the year to March 31,
in support of the “substantial advance”
achieved in turnover.
,r pHE company’s tax provision usually
looks rather light compared with
declared profit at only 34 percent of
gross, and could mostly be explained by
profits earned in New Guinea, although
the ratio is even less than the previous
year’s 38 percent.
Preference capital of $30,000 is being
redeemed at the rate of $lO,OOO a year.
The $1,420,000 capital is supported
by reserves of over s3m. including
$2.4m. general reserve and $404,800
share premium. Less than one-quarter
of land and buildings are at valuation,
the majority being at cost less amounts
written off. Another example of con-
servatism in the accounts is the listed
investments, which, although not large,
are at present worth three times as
much on the market.
In pricing the Cottee’s shares at close
to $4, the market calculates that a
65 p.c. offer from General Foods would
be at about $4.50 for the 50c shares.
Already overseas interests control
$54 lm. of assets in the Australian food,
drink and tobacco industry. So a partial
takeover would be more acceptable
politically than a complete one. But
market experience has been that the
remaining local content suffers a price
reaction after the takeover clamor dies
away.
If Cottee’s falls to American hands,
what is the chance of an independent
future for the equally successful Keith
Harris and Co. and Big Sister Foods?

MINING
Vagaries in Tungsten Markets
Traditionally, tungsten (a
product of wolfram and schee-
lite ores) has been one of the
world’s most volatile metals as far
as market prices are concerned. Nor-
mal demand for tungsten, which is
principally used as an alloying agent
for hardening steel, has shown a steady
growth. Abnormal demand occurs with
large armament building programs, as
evidenced by the Korean War, when
world prices for wolfram rose to a
record of 600/- stg. per ton unit of
WO3 (tungsten oxide) in 1951.
More recently, the escalation of the
war in Vietnam has been a factor in-
fluencing the world prices from around
100/- stg. in late 1963 to a post-
Korean War peak of 370/- stg. in early
March, 1966. Since then, prices have
declined to levels of around 260/- to
270/- in recent weeks.
An even more significant factor in
the short term has been the effect
of releases from reserves stockpiled
after the Korean War by the U.K.
Board of Trade and the G.S.A. in
the United States. The U.K. stock-
pile was exhausted at the end of 1965,
but a new U.S. long-range disposal
plan has caused a reversal in prices
since March this year. It is believed
that the G.S.A. has some 30,000-
35,000 tons of tungsten for release in
its stockpile.
The most important factor affecting
prices in the longer term has been the
export policy of the Communist bloc,
in particular, China, the world’s largest
producer, and also North Korea. The
world price rises over the past couple
of years have been mainly due to the
almost complete withdrawal of China
as a substantial supplier of Eastern
European markets, which in turn
supply the Western world.
It must be realised, too, that, al-
though most tungsten producers expect
increased demand for their product,
one of the main obstacles to its growth
lies in the instability of the pricing of
tungsten ore and the subsequent effect
on the manufacturing and marketing
of tungsten products.
Australian producers of tungsten are
almost entirely subject to the vagaries
of the world market situation, since
domestic consumption is insignificant
(less than 4 percent of total production
in 1964). In recent years almost the
entire Australian production has come
from Tasmanian scheelite and wol-
fram ores.
All scheelite concentrates are pro-
duced from the open-cut mine at
Grassy, on King Island, operated by
King Island Scheelite (1947) Limited.
The principal wolfram producer is
Storeys Creek Tin Mining Company
N.L., a wholly owned subsidiary of
North Australian Uranium Corpora-
tion N.L. (50.02 percent owned by
Aberfoyle Holdings Ltd.). The other
wolfram producer is Aberfoyle Tin
N.L. (wholly owned by Aberfoyle
Holdings Ltd.). Both these companies
produce wolfram in conjunction with
their tin-mining operations, while, on
King Island, scheelite is the sole pro-
duct mined.
Because of the existence of virtually
only three Australian producers of
tungsten concentrates, export statistics
published by the Commonwealth
Statistician are a significant pointer to
the sales achieved by these companies.
Exports of scheelite concentrates have
totalled 1235 tons valued at $A2,388,616
in the eleven months to May, 1966, as
against 1725 tons valued at $1,701,080
in the full 1964/65 financial year. Thus
although scheelite exports have drop-
ped significantly the average price
realised per ton has almost doubled.
Wolfram exports —the combined pro-
duction from Storeys Creek and Aber-
foyle totalled 527.5 tons valued at
$1,037,049 in the eleven months to
May, 1966, compared with 361.4 tons
valued at $513,328 last financial year.
Thus, while quantities of wolfram
exports have increased by about 46
percent in this period, average prices
realised have remained virtually
steady.
PRODUCTION figures for King
Island Scheelite for the half-year to
April 30, 1966, totalled 600 tons of schee-
lite concentrates (containing 43,483 long
ton units of WO3), compared with 1190
tons (containing 85,848 units) in the
year to October 31, 1965. If this rate
is maintained for the remainder of the
year, the full year’s production should
exceed that for 1964/65. In the interim
report directors said that profit for the
half-year was substantially in excess of
that for the previous corresponding
period but warned that, although the
final result was likely to be satisfac-
tory, it would be influenced by tung-
sten prices over the remainder of the
year.
Last year the company signed a new
contract for a three-year period from
June 1, 1965, at a price based on the
lower quotation of the London Metal
Bulletin less delivery charges and also
discounted for the molybdenum con-
tent of the concentrates. Although the
average LMB price during the com-
pany’s 1964/65 year was 190/8d stg.
per long ton unit and could be at
least 230/- to 240/- stg. this year (pro-
vided no major price fall occurs), it is
believed that a substantial tonnage is
sold at a fixed price somewhat below
200/-. However, it is understood that
the company’s break-even price is
around 120-125/- stg. per long ton
unit, so a substantial profit margin still
exists. Moreover, the existence pf a
fixed price for part of the tonnage sold

could provide a buffer against a severe
slump in world prices during the period
of the contract.
Despite seemingly good short-term
prospects for the company, it will con-
tinue to depend heavily on the world
market situation for tungsten. Reserves
of 1,315,700 tons of ore averaging
0.51 percent WO3 indicate a mine
life of about seven years on current
extraction rates. Exploration and test-
ing work being carried out could add
considerably to these reserves.
Profits of both the wolfram pro-
ducers, North Australian Uranium
Corporation N.L. and Aberfoyle Hold-
ings Ltd., for the year to June 30, 1966,
should also reflect higher earnings from
sales of wolfram concentrates. In
1964/65, NAUG produced 293 tons
of wolfram concentrates as against
Aberfoyle’s 138 tons. On current pro-
duction rates, the total for the 1965/66
year should be about 330 tons for
NAUC and 178 tons for Aberfoyle.
The ultimate profits of these com-
panies will also be dependent on results
of their tin production.
COMMODITIES
Petroleum Into
Protein
THE search for food has led to the
old standby, petroleum source
of anything from clothing to
housing to heating. The latest step in
obtaining food, protein, from oil and
gas is the formation of a U.K. joint
project by Standard Oil of New Jersey
and Nestles.
Esso has joined with Nestles because
it considers many skills are required for
developing the piocess the basic idea
of which has been known for several
years.
Shell recently announced a method
of producing protein from methane.
And British Petroleum already has a
plant in France turning out several
hundred pounds of protein a day.
In the BP process, bacteria eat the
paraffins out of the petroleum, leaving
the remainder for further processing.
One pound of paraffin gives one
pound of protein.
A 1000-pound steer, well fed, stores
up one pound of protein a day. In the
same period a half ton of bacteria, feed-
ing on oil, increases weight by five
times, and half the increase is useful
protein 2500 pounds a day.
The division of BP which developed
the process has estimated that 20 million
tons of pure protein could be produced
from 40 million tons of crude oil, a
small ’fraction of current consumption.
The increasing problem of feeding
people in the under-developed nations
means growing pressure for a cheap
source of protein, possibly to be used
as an additive to the usual diet. In
the past tasteless and colorless foods
such as the petroleum-derived ones
have met a far from overwhelming
demand, but perhaps Nestles will be
able to overcome this problem.
Pricing Aluminium
GERMAN and Japanese producers
have recently advanced their
prices for aluminium ingot. This
reflects growing pressure for a higher
return on capital invested in primary
aluminium production.
Until the recent break, U.S. prices
have been the guide for world markets.
But the U.S. Government’s anti-
inflation policy has distorted the pat-
tern.
Canada, led by Alcan, the world’s
largest exporter of the metal, is pro-
bably the key to a general world price
rise.
Supplies are extremely tight at
present, but coming years could see
over-capacity. Certainly plans for new
smelters are announced almost weekly
and forecasts of future output are
constantly revised upward. But markets
for the metal are also growing • far
faster than for any other major metal.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Bad Debts a Determinant
Simpson Pope's chances of book profit
Pope industries limited
was taken over by the Simpson
interests in 1963, although at that
time it might have been suggested that
a merger of interests was taking place.
A. Simpson and Son Limited was origi-
nally founded in 1852 and incorpor-
ated in 1910. Simpson Distributors
was incorporated in 1954 and became
the public company of the Simpson
group when about 25 percent of the
issued capital was sold to the public.
Pope Industries was formed in 1945
and had become a leading manufac-
turer of domestic appliances as well as
being a producer of irrigation equip-
ment and electric motors.
A few months prior to the merger,
the shares of Pope were selling at 49
cents, probably as a result of the rather
large loss which was incurred in
1960-61 and the only slight recovery
which took place in the following year.
Today, these shares are being sought
at 28 cents with no seller, but the last
sale took place in Sydney at 34 cents.
The promise of rehabilitation under
the banner of the successful Simpson
group has not yet materialised,
apparently.
In many respects this seems like an
unfair assessment by the stock markets
because, although another loss was
suffered in 1962-63, reasonable profits
were made in 1963-64 and 1964-65.
However, it became obvious that the
company, like so many others, was
caught up with a bad debts problem
in the second half of 1964-65 and
decided to reduce the dividend with a
view to conserving liquid funds. The
chairman’s address indicated that the
problem debtor was H. G. Palmer. It
also referred to the other major prob-
lem of the appliance manufacturer
resale price maintenance. This problem
seems to have not yet been settled in
a satisfactory manner by any manu-
facturer and at least two companies
have had to withdraw from an attempt
to establish a satisfactory base price.
The last announcement from Simp-
son took the form of the half-yearly
profit statement. From this statement,
it would appear that net profit before
tax, depreciation and interest on long-
term debt was $1,077,664 for the first
six months of 1965-66, as compared
with $1,856,088 for the full twelve
months of the 1964-65 year. Whether
this constitutes any improvement is
difficult to say without figures for
the first half of 1964-65; it is likely
that the major part of the profit of
an appliance manufacturer is earned
in the first half of the financial year
when that year ends on June 30.
In any event, earnings per share
after making allowance for the low
tax provision would only have about
1.3 cents in 1964-65 and, if it was
assumed that the same profits would
be earned in the second half as in
the first half, earnings per share would
have risen to about 1.6 cents per
share in 1965-66 if the company had
not found it necessary to provide 45
percent of the first-half’s net profit be-
fore tax against bad debts. On the
face of it and because bad debts are
not a tax deduction until the loss actu-
ally occurs, this would mean that, if
the company had been paying full tax,
earnings per share would have been
nil in the six months to December 31,
1965.
Clearly, we are again in a situation
where the extent of the bad debt pro-
vision will determine whether or not
a book profit is made during the year.
The bad and doubtful debt provision
of the company stood at $1,094,000 as
at December 31, 1965 over 22 per-
cent of the book value of the trade
debtors. It had been increased by
$450,000 during the six months, but
only 42 percent of this increase repre-
sented a deduction from the profits of
the period. During 1964-5 there was
little change in the bad and doubtful
debts provision; the stock adjustment
account was reduced by over $217,000
after having been reduced by just over
$143,000 in the previous year.
from the questions of bad
debts and stock reserves, there seem
to be some other factors which make it
difficult to compare the three years’
profits since the merger. There has been
some considerable expense involved in
the reorganisation which has been
going on to integrate the activities of
Simpson and Pope. It has been sug-
gested that the benefits of this re-
organisation will only be felt in the
1966-7 year. In the 1962-3 annual
report it was stated that a policy de-
cision had the effect of deferring sales
normally made in the final quarter of
the year into the first quarter of the
next without a similar deferral of costs.
Unfortunately, the effect on profit can-
not be judged, yet it is noticeable that
net profit before tax in 1963-4 was
nearly 27 percent higher than in 1964-5.
When account is taken of net profit
before tax, depreciation, and interest,
and the movements in stock reserves
and bad and doubtful debt reserves are
added back, it looks as though the re-
sultant figure for profit was nearly 50
percent higher in 1963-4 than it was
in 1964-5.
From June 30, 1963, to June 30,
1965, borrowings had been reduced by
over $1 million, and this had had the
effect of reducing the total interest
charge. The balance sheet as at Decem-
ber 31, 1965, showed an increase of over
$200,000 in these borrowings; as the
whole of the increase was in loans and
deposits of less than 12 months dura-
tion, this might have been a seasonal
fluctuation similar to the fluctuation
in bank overdraft (up $1.2 million
from June 30 to December 31). While
the maturity dates of the loans on
mortgage are unknown, the bulk of the
registered unsecured notes mature on
November 1, 1969; prior to this matur-
ity, the company has the opportunity
to reduce its gearing by paying off the
634,000 $2 redeemable preference shares
which it seems can be repaid at $2.30
any time after June 30, 1966. While
the 30 cent premium might seem like
a deterrent to repayment, it must be
pointed out that, when the company
has to pay tax on profits, it would have
to earn nearly 11 percent before tax
on the amount required to repay these
shares to pay the dividends.
Clearly, even if profits should re-
cover 1 , and it is quite likely that they
will, there is a strong disincentive to
make substantial dividend payments on
the ordinary shares. The critical time
for the present ordinary shareholders
will be July 1, 1973, when the conver-
tible notes and deferred shares become
ordinary shares and the equity capital
will be $10.7 million. Until that time,
I think it is unlikely that the dividend
will exceed three cents per share. I
wish that it was possible to make some
judgment about the likely earnings per
share.

6 reasons to consider the
assured professional
careers offered by the
Royal Military
College, Duntroon
(with the opportunity to
achieve a University degree)
A young- man’s choice of career is a big step. The
question of tertiary education (and possibly Univers-
ity degree qualifications) must be seriously consid-
ered by the young man and his parents. Tertiary
education can be expensive. Most certainly it should
be directly related to a rewarding and highly regarded
career. The Royal Military College, Duntroon, offers
a unique combination of education and career.

Study conditions are outstanding. There is
* no overcrowding. Students have individual
rooms. Classes do not exceed 25, tutorial groups,
12. Full library facilities are constantly available.
2 On graduation from the Royal Military
* College, Lieutenants will have completed a
fully tertiary level course in Arts or Applied Science
or Engineering. Many officers will then have the
opportunity of completing degree courses in Engin-
eering or Applied Science at a recognised Uni-
versity.
There is no financial burden on parents. All
v * tuition and text books are free. In addition,
students are wholly maintained and paid a weekly
rate ranging from $14.52 to $22.29, plus living
out allowances during leave.
4 Promotion, on graduation, is rapid. The
• Royal Military College graduates are com-
missioned as Lieutenants and promoted to Captain
in four years. A Lieutenant receives a basic weekly
salary of $57.61, a Captain $73.78, a Major $100.66.
Marriage and clothing allowances are extra. For a
Major these would total another $13.51 a week. All
food, initial clothing, medical and dental treatment
etc.; is free.
There are frequent opportunities for travel.
• Officers can also be posted overseas for
specialised training or exchange duty in areas
such as the U.K., France, Germany, Hawaii and
U.S.A.
The Army awards up to 50 scholarships each
v • year to suitable candidates to allow them to
remain an extra year at school and qualify for
matriculation prior to entering the Royal Military
College. The scholarships are awarded on merit,
irrespective of the financial status of the candi-
date’s family.
To be eligible for entry to commissioned service in the
Australian Regular Army through the Royal Military
College , Duntroon , applicants must be aged between 16-19
years and have matriculated , are about to matriculate or

THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF N.S.W. GIVES
The Case FOR the Companies Acts
By THE HON. K. M. McCAW, MLA
IT would be idle to pretend that some provisions of the companies legislation are not capable of being misused; it is a pity,
perhaps, that Mr. Clyne has impaired his case against them by the intemperate language in which certain of his passages
are couched and the extravagant conclusions which he has drawn.
M Y attention has been drawn to
an article published in THE
BULLETIN of July 2, 1966, writ-
ten by Mr. Peter Clyne, called
“Companies Acts —the Other Side.”
The writer of the article adopts as
his theme; “Are basic and essential
rights being whittled away?”
Viewed objectively, it can be said
that the article is highly colored and
draws largely from dissenting judg-
ments in the Testro Case (Testro
Bros. v. Tait 109 C.L.R. 353) and
a critical analysis of that case by
Mr. Gerard Nash in an article pub-
lished in the “AustraliamLaw Jour-
nal” of August, 1964. Nevertheless,
it does raise important matters
which have been the subject of a
good deal of debate and discussion
in many circles.
The principal burden of the article
involves the development of the
proposition that the provisions of the
uniform companies legislation relat-
ing to the investigation of companies
have resulted in a whittling away
of essential or basic rights in respect
of the following:
(a) The act of the Governor in
“declaring” a company and
“appointing” inspectors with-
out the company or the indi-
viduals to be investigated be-
ing given any chance to
answer what is alleged against
them.
(b) The procedure adopted by
the inspectors in the conduct
of their investigation.
(c) The publication by the
Governor of the report of the
inspector when made.
Perhaps the first thing which should
be said in reply is that the provisions
are not new. Substantially similar legis-
lation was in operation in Victoria as
long ago as 1940, whilst the funda-
mental sections of the United Kingdom
Companies Act of 1948 and the investi-
gation procedures adopted in that coun-
try are on all fours with those in force
in Australia. Mr. Clyne’s claim that
“provision might have been made that
both company and witnesses should
have a right to be legally represented;
that they should be told exactly what
is alleged against them, and that they
should have a chance to confront their
accusers and to marshal and present
their defence” is, in fact, a claim that
the investigation should take the form
of a judicial inquiry. He is entitled to
that opinion, but, when regard is had
to the complexities of the transactions
involving large numbers of related com-
panies extending over many years, as
disclosed in the published reports, there
are few, I believe, who would not agree
that to attempt to apply to proceedings
before inspectors what are described as
the principles of natural justice would
be to deprive those proceedings of their
usefulness.
As the Law Council of Australia has
pointed out: “One particular difficulty
is that natural justice contemplates
that there shall be some charge or
allegation which is being investigated,
and proceeds upon the footing that a
party shall know what is alleged
against him and have a full opportunity
of meeting such allegations. In the case
of many investigations there will, at
least at the outset, be no knowledge on
the part of an inspector of any alle-
gations against any individuals and
suspicions or opinions concerning any
person may only form in the mind
of the inspector during the course of
what may be a lengthy investigation.”
OERTAIN conditions have to be satis-
fied before the Governor takes the
step of “declaring” a company or “ap-
pointing” inspectors under the Act. Of
course, the Governor, in the exercise of
this power vested in him, acts upon the
advice of his Executive (having con-
sidered all of the material then avail-
able); just as in any other Executive
action “behind closed doors” there is
nothing sinister in the fact that such
a decision is not examinable by the
Courts. Our system of government
assumes that Ministers vested with such
authority and power will act in accord-
ance with the trust imposed upon them
to the best of their ability and in the
public interest.
The Acts themselves provide that,
before an inspector is appointed upon
the application of certain persons speci-
fied in 5.169, the application “shall be
supported by such evidence as the
Governor requires as to the reasons
for the application and the motives of
the applicants in requiring the investi-
gation and the Governor may, before
appointing an inspector, require the
applicants to give security . . . for
costs of the investigation.” Similarly
with 5.172, the “declaration” which Mr;
Clyne refers to shall not be made un-
less the Governor “is satisfied that a
prima facie case has been established
that for the protection of the public
, . . or the shareholders or creditors
of the company or foreign company,
it is desirable that the affairs of the
company or foreign company should be
investigated . . and again by an
amendment to the Act made in 1964,
“the Governor is satisfied that it is in
the public interest that allegations of
fraud or misfeasance by persons who
are or have been concerned with the
formation or management of the com--
pany or foreign company should be
investigated . . .”
It will be seen that the Executive
has to be satisfied that certain grave
and weighty matters exist before the
steps of making a public declaration
and appointing inspectors are taken.
I T has been said by Mr. Clyne that
“the very act of declaring the found-
ering vessel will sink it on the spot in
view of the publicity involved.” How-
ever, an examination of the instances
in which the power has been exercised
does not disclose in any case that it
was the act of declaration (or the
appointment of inspectors) which
caused “the foundering vessel to sink,”
In some cases —very few—if has been
claimed that the declaration or appoint-
ment was a contributing cause to the
subsequent failure of the company.
However, it could not, in any of these
cases, be said that but for the declara-
tion or appointment the company
would not have failed. The view in
Australia is that it is better in the
public interest to bring these matters
out into the open rather than to attempt
to conduct an investigation in secret
with the attendant damage and dis-
quiet which could result, from rumor
and speculation, where some people, by
reason of their position, might have an
unfair advantage over shareholders,
creditors, and the public at large. It
is felt that, with the safeguards pro-
vided within the terms of the Acts
themselves, the commercial world
and investing public are better served
by an open announcement.
There is perhaps room for argument
on the question whether the directors
of a company should be given an
opportunity to answer what is alleged
against them prior to the declaration
being made or inspectors being,
appointed. This appears to have been
the practice in the United Kingdom at
least prior to the publication of the
Report of the Jenkins Company Law
Committee in June, 1962. Witnesses be-
fore the Committee were critical of the
practice on the basis “that this pro-
cedure not merely forewarned the
directors of the precise nature of the
complaints and thus gives them ample


opportunity, if they are so minded, to
destroy or fabricate evidence before the
appointment of an inspector, but also,
on occasion, leads to lengthy delays
while the directors compose their
reply.” The comment by the Commit-
tee is worth reporting at length:
“215. We fully appreciate the diffi-
cult position in which the Board of
Trade are placed. The appointment of
an inspector to investigate the conduct
of a company’s affairs is a serious step
which can have serious consequences
for the company and its members, even
when the complaints are eventually
shown to be entirely without foundation.
Suggestions have been made to us for
making the appointment of an inspector
less harmful to the company investi-
gated, so that the Board of Trade
might feel freer to appoint inspectors.
It has been suggested, for example, that
there should be two kinds of investi-
gation, one where criminal activities
were suspected and another, which
would not carry the stigma of the
former, where misfeasance or oppres-
sion was suspected.
“We do not believe that a division of
this kind—even if it could be applied
in practice, which we doubt would
really avoid, in non-criminal cases, the
stigma associated now with the appoint-
ment of an inspector. It has also been
suggested that damage to companies
might be reduced if the Board were to
appoint inspectors without giving pub-
lic notice of the fact. The Board of
Trade already have power to appoint
inspectors without public notice and we
understand that, in the case of private
companies, this course is generally fol-
lowed.
“BUT we do not think that in prac-
tice inspections of public companies
could be conducted without giving rise
at some stage to rumors; and, in any
event, we think that shareholders and
potential shareholders of public com-
panies have a right to know when an
inspector has been appointed. We have
come to the conclusion that nothing
can be done to prevent the appoint-
ment of an inspector causing some
damage to a company. We do, how-
ever, believe that the Board of Trade
would find it easier to decide when an
inspection is justified and therefore
be less likely to be inhibited from ap-
pointing inspectors by fear of causing
unnecessary damage if they had
power to obtain documents and infor-
mation from companies under suspicion
with a view to deciding whether or not
to appoint an inspector. The provision
of such powers would have the further
advantage that the Board of Trade
would be able to test the complainants’
Statement of Facts without necessarily
revealing to the directors the case
against them and without the delays
sometimes involved in awaiting the
directors’ reply.”
The Committee recommended that
the Board of Trade should not regard
themselves as bound to forward a State-
ment of Facts provided by the com-
plainant to the company complained
against.
So far as the second basis of con-
flict is concerned, that is to say the
method or rather the procedure
adopted for the conduct of the investi-
gations so authorised, Mr. Clyne has
made the points that a person being
interrogated has no right to be legally
represented and can be compelled to
answer incriminating questions although
his answers cannot be used against
him if he objects to each question.
It is important to note that in the
Testro Bros, case, despite what Mr.
Clyne has written about the absence
of legal representation, he diet not refer
to an important passage in the dis-
senting judgment of Mr. Justice Kitto
(and, indeed, the Court was unanimous
on this aspect) where it was stated at
page 371:
“The object of the proceedings out
of which this appeal arises was to obtain
a decision as to whether the appellant,
having been required to give evidence
as a witness before an inspector ap-
pointed under s. 173 of the Companies
Act, 1961 (Viet.), was entitled to have
counsel present throughout his examina-
tion before the inspector, so that he
might have the protection of any proper
submissions and that he might be asked
by his counsel any questions directed to
clarifying his evidence or amplifying
or supplementing it in respects relevant
to the inquiry.
“The inspector, the respondent to the
appeal, has informed the Court by his
counsel that a misunderstanding has
occurred. He says that he will allow
the appellant’s counsel to be present
for the purposes mentioned and had
not intended otherwise. The question
whether and to what extent the appel-
lant is in law entitled to the assistance
of counsel is therefore academic in this
case, at least at the present stage.
Special leave to appeal would not have
been granted if the inspector’s attitude
had been known to the Court at the
time of the application.”
I am advised that it has for some
time been the practice in New South
Wales to allow representation so far as
practicable along the lines referred to
in the judgment above.
As regards Mr. Clyne’s reference to
the fact that a “company suspect” is
compelled to answer incriminating
questions and that his answers can be
used against him “unless in answer to
each separate question he utters the
magic incantation” (that is, unless he
claims that the answer to the question
might incriminate him), the following
extract from an address by Mr. Justice
Gowans to the Victorian Bar on July
29, 1965, and reported in Vol. 39 of
the “Australian Law Journal” at page
334 is in point:
“Another objection of an associated
kind raised in B—’s Case was that it
would be oppressive or unfair to admit
the statements made before the in-
vestigator. That depended upon the
nature of the question and the diffusive-
ness of the answer. In some of those
cases the question may be put in rather
a pointed way by the investigator and
the answer may take three pages; and
it was suggested that it was, in those
circumstances, quite unfair to admit
the question if it was pointed, or the
answer if it was diffuse.
“I came to the conclusion that it
was a matter of discretion for the
judge whether he should reject evi-
dence of that kind on the ground that
it would be unfair; and in Case
I directed the Crown to make a closer
selection of the record which they pro-
posed to tender. They did that in due
course, and I think t the objection then
lapsed.
‘ t|f pHEN, on this matter, there is an
objection on the ground that the
claim of incrimination, permitted under
5.171 of the Companies Act, has been
taken. B— had taken objection to every
question that was put to him by the
inspector. That is to say, he had not
repeated it,for each particular question;
he said at the start, ‘lf you want me
to do so I will do it, but I take objec-
tion to answering any question you put
to me.’
“I decided that that blanket objec-
tion was good, having regard to the
language of the statute, although, of
course, it would not be good on
ordinary common law principles be-
cause you would have to take your
objection to a particular question, and
it would have to appear that the answer
to that question would tend to in-
criminate the examinee before it would
be rejected at common law. But this
section is rather special in its
language.”
A further matter referred to by Mr.
Clyne was “the inspector may seize
and impound the company’s books.”
He has conveniently overlooked the
provisions of 5.171(3A) which provides
that (the inspector)
“(b) may retain all such books and
documents for such time as he
considers to be necessary for the
purpose of the investigation; and
(c) shall permit such corporation to
have access at all reasonable
times to all such books and docu-
ments so long as they are in his
possession,”
both provisions being inserted by the
1964 Amending Acts.
A further matter referred to was the
contempt disclosed in re Davies-Roe
and the Companies Act, 1965, N.S.W.R.
767, now recorded in 83 Weekly Notes
at page 10, which Mr. Clyne claimed
held that witnesses are guilty of con-
tempt if they so much as insist upon
a shorthand writer taking down the
questions and answers, or on writing
down each question in longhand before
they answer it. The facts of that case
were that a court reporter was present
during the whole of the examination
of the witness for the purpose of
making a transcript of the proceedings.
As appears from the following extract

Justice McLelland, Chief Judge in

Equity, the witness nevertheless sought
to write down both the questions and
answers in longhand before consenting
to deliver his answer:
“Upon it appearing that he first
wrote the question and answer down,
one of the inspectors again explained
the situation to him and pointed out
that it was not reasonable to write down
every question and answer in longhand
before making an answer. The inspector
also read out the terms of s. 171 (4).
The respondent maintained his former
attitude and over a considerable period,
lasting from some time after 11 a.m.
to some time shortly after 12.40 p.m.,
a number of questions were put to the
respondent, most of which were not, in
fact, answered. On the respondent per-
sisting in his attitude, the proceedings
were terminated.”
It was this attitude which the Court
found constituted contempt.
Mr. Clyne is on surer ground in his
reference to the unfortunate con-
sequences which may flow from the
publication of the report of an inspec-
tor. The point that should be made is
that publication is not inevitable but
is dependent upon the Governor being
of the opinion that it is necessary in
the public interest to cause the report
to be printed and published. Where a
report recommended the institution of
criminal proceedings, it was the prac-
tice of the previous Government to
withhold publication of the report until
those proceedings had been instituted.
As a general principle, however, I am
of the view that such a report should
not be published until after the con-
clusion of the proceedings, if even then,
since the public interest, normally, will
be sufficiently served by the publicity
accorded those proceedings.
Nevertheless, there may be circum-
stances where publication of a report
will be the only means whereby share-
holders or creditors can be made aware
of the existence of grounds for civil
proceedings against a company or its
officers.
M R CLYNE has also drawn attention
to the provisions of the Acts which
provide that in any legal proceedings
the report is evidence not only of the
inspector’s opinion but also of the facts
upon which his opinion is based, and
has asserted that, since the legislation
makes the inspector’s opinion a ground
for winding-up, “the company can be
legally wiped off the slate simply be-
cause in the inspector’s opinion it is
insolvent and should be wound up.”
This is not, in my opinion, an accurate
statement of the law.
In Re Testro Bros. Consolidated
Limited, 1965, V.R. 18, Sholl J. treated
an inspector’s findings of fact contained
in a report as prim a facie evidence
only and entered into an investigation
of those facts, holding that it was
ultimately a question of judicial dis-
cretion whether, on the facts as ulti-
mately found, the inspector’s opinion
ought to be adopted.
In what has been written above, I
have been concerned that a more
balanced approach than that exhibited
by Mr. Glyne be brought to bear on
the statutory provisions relating to the
investigation of companies. I am not
to be understood as asserting that those
provisions are free of latent dangers,
and I am aware that any defence which
relies to any degree upon the bene-
ficial exercise of those powers by the
Executive will receive something less
than universal approval.
, AT the same time I think it is proper
to observe that many of those who
oppose these provisions, in their con-
cern for the rights of those responsible
for the conduct of the affairs of com-
panies, have too little regard for the
interests of shareholders, creditors, and
the public at large. I consider it not
unreasonable that persons sheltering
behind a corporate structure and rely-
ing in many instances upon the public
to finance their operations should have
to reckon with the possibility that cir-
cumstances may render it necessary for
their conduct of the affairs of the cor-
poration to be exposed to public gaze,
following an inquiry of the kind envis-
aged by the present legislation.
I do not think I can better conclude
than by bringing under notice the fol-
lowing extract from a recent judgment
by Windeyer J. in Rees v. Kratzmann,
39 Australian Law Journal Reports at
page 210, where, in referring to the
examination of directors under a dif-
ferent section of the Companies Act
than that in issue here, His Honor
stated:
“There is in the common law a
traditional objection to compulsory
interrogations. Blackstone explained it:
Tor at the common law, nemo tene-
batur prodere seipsum: and his fault
was not to be wrung out of himself,
but rather to be discovered by other
means, and other men’: Comm. IV,
296. The continuing regard for this
element in the lawyer’s notion of justice
may be, as has been suggested, partly
a consequence of a persistent memory
in the common law of hatred of the
Star Chamber and its works. It is
linked, too, with the cherished view of
English lawyers that their methods are
more just than are the inquisitional
procedures of other countries.
“But, strong as has been the influence
of this attitude upon the administra-
tion of the common law, of the criminal
law especially, it must be admitted
that in the Chancery Court it had less
place; and in bankruptcy jurisdiction
it has been largely displaced. For
example, a debtor upon his public ex-
amination in bankruptcy cannot refuse
to answer questions on the ground that
the answers may incriminate him (Re
Paget; Ex parte Official Receiver,
(1927) 2 Ch. 85; Re Jawett, (1929) 1
Ch. 108), the purpose of the bank-
ruptcy statute being to secure a full
and complete examination and dis-
closure of the facts relating to the
bankruptcy in the interests of the
public.
“The provisions of the Companies
Act reflect, it seems to me, the same
idea. The honest conduct of the affairs
of companies is a matter of great public
concern today. If the legislature thinks
that in this field the public interest
overcomes some of the common law’s
traditional consideration for the in-
dividual, then effect must be given to
the statute which embodies this policy.
As the law stood in the past the mere
summoning of a person to attend a
public examination in a winding up
necessarily carried a suggestion that he
was in some way connected with a
fraud. But the wider scope and purpose
of the present section makes such an
inference unjustifiable.”

MAN ON THE LAND
The ANU and Agriculture
A PROPOSAL that a Faculty of
Agriculture be established at the
Australian National University,
Canberra, comes at a time when agri-
cultural education itself requires clqse
scrutiny. The need for security comes
not from somebody’s say-so. It comes
from:
• The growth of the farm manage-
ment club movement and the private
farm consultant in Australia.
• The emergence of the econometric
whole-farm management theory. This is
reshaping farming.
• The readily substantiated fact that
farmers themselves, and future farmers,
are now aware of the benefits of speci-
alised education but are still uncertain
of the best way to go about getting it.
Agricultural education is not very
old in Australia. Most of the faculties of
agriculture began in the 19305, and the
influence of the Depression is appar-
ent. While there is evidence to show
that the enthusiasts envisaged something
quite different, the fact remains that
the politicians, who had to provide the
funds, more or less demanded that the
agricultural faculties’ object was to
train people for the departments of
agriculture. In a very real sense the
faculties and the departments became
one and the same thing.
Farmers, even more so in those days
than now, wanted their departments of
agriculture but did not want to have
to pay for them. It was not until fairly
recent times, with the establishment of
the University of New England and
later the privately endowed Marcus
Oldham College at Geelong, that a
break with tradition took place. These
are, at present, the only places of learn-
ing where whole-farm management,
with its strong emphasis on farm
economics, is taught.
ir pHE whole-farm approach should not
be confused with the type of educa-
tion available at the agricultural colleges
Hawkesbury and Wagga in N.S.W.,
Dookie and Longerenong in Victoria,
Roseworthy in South Australia, and
Gatton in Queensland. These were
planned, originally, to teach the tech-
niques of farming to farmers’ sons.
They did this very well and still do.
(Although these days, with fewer
farmers on the land, there is a strong,
even dominant, section of city boys
attending them. If they are lucky
enough to have wealthy parents they
find the diploma useful when they buy
a farm themselves; also it is a good
means of entry into a commercial
firm servicing farmers in one way or
another.)
The departments of agriculture
administer the colleges and rely heavily
on them for field officers. It could be
said that the standard of technical
farm training in Australia is very high
—but it is not enough in these times.
Doing a thing the right way is point-
less if doing it does not pay.
This is why the farm management
club movement has grown so remark-
ably in recent years and why the pri-
vate farm consultant is now an estab-
lished entity in the community, just
like the solicitor, accountant, or doctor.
But unlike the solicitor, accountant, or
doctor, the farm consultant is virtually
excluded as a force in education. Rela-
tively few doctors, or lawyers, actually
give lectures in universities, yet they
all have an influence on what is
taught in the faculties of medicine and
law, and vice versa. It is the same
with accountants and their institutes.

goes in the next ten years, it seems
safe to say that there is a strong likeli-
hood of its achieving a status of its
own. It will not be administered by
the department any more than the
Department of Health administers the
Faculty of Medicine. Instead of pro-
viding graduate employees for the
department, as the object, it will pro-
vide graduates who may go into the
department, perhaps into private con-
sulting, or perhaps back to their own
farms. But while the likelihood of this
is strong the way is by no means
clear.
It will become clear probably only
when the departments, and this applies
in all States, desire the change them-
selves. Younger graduates, many of
them, see the benefits of such a change
already. They see the higher salaries
earned by some private consultants.
Yet within the departments there can
be detected some aversion still to pri-
vate consulting, on the grounds that its
role is not teaching men to be better
farmers but showing them how to put
in a better taxation return. This is
a narrow' view, yet it does exist.
A thorough examination of the case
for a Faculty of Agriculture at the
ANU seems warranted. The ANU is
in a position to start from scratch, and
examination of this specific proposal
becomes, in a way, an examination of
agricultural education generally.
A submission has been prepared by
individuals who are members of the
Yass Valley Organisation, Queanbeyan
branch of the Graziers’ Association, and
the Australian Institute of Agricultural
Science. Dr. F. Morley, of the CSIRO,
is a supporter. One would assume that
pasture improvement, and the eco-
nomics of pasture improvement, would
figure prominently in the envisaged
course. Mr. J. Watson, a grazier, is
another supporter who is generally
considered to be in the very front rank
of those enthusiasts devoted to the
scientific study of stocking rates and
pastures.
The submission suggests that the
ANU appoint its own committee of
inquiry to investigate the merits of
the proposal. It says, and we agree, that
“most farm decision makers are 50
years of age, or older, left school at 14
or 15, and then endured the Great
Depression. This left them with strongly
conservative views. These are the men
who have set a pattern of low demand
for the services of agricultural gradu-
ates.” It points out that all the existing
State-run colleges and university courses
have more applicants than places, and
that Marcus Oldham, which is expen-
sive ($l2OO a year), had 160 applicants
for 32 vacancies last year.
This, in itself, more or less proves
the point that whole-farm management
is the current need rather than instruc-
tion in farming techniques. Our im-
pression is that the technical side is
reasonably well covered. Quite apart
from the State colleges there are a
number of Catholic colleges doing ex-
cellent work, although they rarely
figure in discussion on the subject.
Some, at least, are worthy of elevation
to diploma status.
The submission to the ANU is im-
pressive and, of course, some of the
particular reasons why Canberra should
have a Faculty of Agriculture apply
only to the immediate area. But the
ANU would be doing the country at
large a service if it went into the matter
in the broadest possible way and pub-
lished its findings.
The need for guidelines in agricul-
tural education is becoming urgent.
One small part of such an investiga-
tion, and one which forever intrigues
us personally, would be an assessment
of the proportion of farmers who are
motivated by profit against those who
are motivated by something else and
why. That certain rigidity of attitude
to be found sometimes in farming,
agricultural education, and departments
of agriculture possibly stems from the
cottonwool applied to the wounds of
long ago.

Raising the Lamb Crop
A WOOLGROWER with a flock
±\ based on 2000 breeding ewes can
increase his gross income by $284
each time he raises the lamb-marking
percentage by one percent. This calcu-
lation has been made by Dr. G. R.
Moule, Director of Production Re-
search for the Australian Wool Board.
He also believes that the quickest
and easiest means of increasing returns
from sheep-farming today is by im-
proving the reproduction rate of the
flock. The higher income comes not
°, nly directly tbe additiona
sheep themselves but from a number of
mdirect consequences as well For
instance, with more sheep to choose
f om > a farmer can gradually raise
the quality of his entire flock. The
average cut per head rises, too, because
the average age of the flock sheep falls
as more young sheep are available.
Recently in this column it was said
that some sheepmen have managed to
increase the average number of lambs
marked by up to 20 percent. Supposing
these people have 2000 ewe flocks, they
will eventually add rather more than
$5OOO to their gross annual incomes.
Money in this amount appears very at-
tractive. How then does one go about
raising the lamb-marking percentage?
There is no one simple answer Dif-
fprpni crr-wlar-c c u * i • .

different practical steps, but all aim at
c leving ree asic things: ensur-
mg t at the ewes are properly fed dur-
ing the last 4-6 weeks of pregnancy,
that the lambs are protected from in-
dement weather during at least the first
twelve hours after birth and that
human assistance is at hand to extend
aid in cases of difficult birth and mis-
mothering. •
One of Australia’s acknowledged
authorities on lamb losses, Dr. G. Alex-
ander, of CSIRO, has summarised his
years of experiments and experience by
claiming that starvation is by far the
commonest cause of death among young
lambs. And he says that this state of
affairs usually stems from mismothering
or a f eeb i e response to mothering on
the of the larab Such unna J ural
behaviour result in , from
pre _ natal nutritio n, and bad weather
at the time of birth aggravates incipi .

harm befell them.
Perhaps one of the more significant
of his r £ cent findings is that f lamb . s
sucking drive is strongest immediately
after birth. However, the urge to suck
and seek the udder declines rapidly
unless the lamb’s early attempts are
successful. Thus, he found that lambs
typically spend 30 percent of the first
two-three hours after birth trying to
suck. But during the twelfth hour, if
they have been unsuccessful in the
meantime because of mismothering or
the stresses of cold, they spend only
five percent of the time trying to get
milk. With their sucking drive almost
spent they are now headed for starva-
tion.
During these studies he noted another
curious fact: lambs that fail to get
milk in the first six or so hours after
birth make poor subsequent growth.
Even four months afterwards, lambs
that endured such an experience in the
first few hours of their life weighed
less than their more fortunate flock
mates. It has been known for some time,
moreover, that the standard of nutri-
tion during the early months of a
sheep’s life has a lasting effect on its
wool production. Now it is being said
that early nutrition also has a strong
influence on a ewe’s breeding potential.
Besides doing the best he can to
provide good feed for the breeding-
flock, a farmer can greatly influence
a lamb's chances of survival by pro-
viding even rudimentary shelter for the
first critical hours after its birth. Some
farmers are doing this by drifting ewes
about to lamb into small, well-protected
paddocks containing tussocks or timber.
Others are putting out hay bales or
staking up old sheets of corrugated
iron, and a few are even building sheds
and yards, because these not only offer
the best shelter but enable the farmer
to attend closely at difficult births and
help the lamb to obtain an early feed.
Attitudes toward lambing are reverting
to those of the early days when flocks
had shepherds who folded the sheep

SPECULATORS DIARY
Philosophy of a Diarist
A return to buying as well
LAST week I surprised myself by producing a diary even though I hadn’t
bought or sold one share. Whatever else that may prove, it’s no way to make
money. In fact, it is the very antithesis of this diar'y’s requirements for success.
In my more introspective moments I
have, over the years, often tried to
discover why the diary’s approach to
investment seems to be more success-
ful than a lot of others. The answer,
I think, is that shares must be bought
and sold quickly.
For this, I have to thank not my
own judgment but the diary itself. In
order to maintain any readership at
all, it’s pretty necessary to buy and
sell at least a couple of different stocks
each week. This has proved to be a
good discipline. It has meant that
losses have had to be faced up to as
they’ve arisen (and not months or even
years later).
ft has also meant that profits have
had to be taken as they’ve occurred.
This has made it difficult to hold on
to shares greedily in the hope that
profits will get even fatter. That can,
of course, result in premature selling,
as it has done recently in the case
of Western Mining, Woodside, and F.
W. Williams. But, by and large, it
has been a good thing, and even on
those three I made nice profits (par-
ticularly on Woodside). I’ve long since
learnt that it’s better to sell too early
(on the way up) than too late (on
the way down).
I’m beginning to preach. I must
stop and practise instead!
First I applied the above philosophy
to Cottees by taking a modest profit
of $6O and selling out at $3.90 while
takeover was still under discussion. I’m
probably throwing money away the
takeover will probably be worth $5 a
share. Then, again, it might fall through
altogether, or it may only be a partial
offer. On reflection I thought it best
not to be greedy, particularly as the
market usually isn’t far off the mark
in these cases.
Nor could I resist the temptation to
sell some of my Kathleens when they
jumped up. This was on the day of
the annual meeting, which I attended.
Nothing new emerged at this meeting.
Yet when I looked in to the public
gallery on my way back through
Kindersley House from this meeting I
was surprised to see shares up nearly
20 cents. So I sold my 400 shares for
a profit of $63.
QONTRARY to the rules set out so
dogmatically above, I held on to the
400 rights, even though they were
showing a profit of $lOO. Somehow I
feel that where there’s smoke there’s
fire or at least iron ore.
The sale of the Cottees and the
Kathleen shares replenished the old
coffers to the extent of $1637 (plus
the $383 credit from a fortnight ago).
So I was loaded.
I quickly did a lot of this on the
100 Philip Morris I mentioned I was
getting two weeks ago. I realised after-
wards that this was probably a foolish
move, as it ties up such a lot of money.
And even if Philip Morris should rise
to $8 at the time of its result, the
proportionate gain wouldn’t be all
that much.
I was frustrated in my two other
buying endeavors this week AWA
at $1.90 and Sydney Mutual (return
bout) at $3.40. I was a bit slow with
the AWA, which yield over 4%, and,
as the only really Australian-owned
electronics show, must be a terrific long-
term buy. Sydney Mutual, on the
other hand, which I sold only a few
weeks back at $3.67, never got back
down to my $3.40 limit.
SOLD
400 Kathleen, $2.20, $863.
200 Cottees, $3.90, $775.
BOUGHT
100 Philip Morris, $7.10, $725.
This one purchase left me with
$1295 and the following portfolio:
