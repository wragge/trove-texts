Pacifica
It is now possible to fill in more details
about the lost continent or archipelago of
Pacifica. If you sailed almost due east
from Sydney about 4500 miles and an in-
definite number of centuries back, you
would come to its southern extremity.
Turning n.-e., you would sail for nearly
6000 miles almost to Japan along the coasts
of large and fertile islands whose high
mountain ranges included an enormous
number of active volcanoes. Great rivers
opening into sheltered bays would be seen
carrying the perpetual rains down from
these mountains to the ocean. You would
also become aware of a large and vigorous
population. By day your helmsman would
be busy threading his way through a sea
covered with double canoes fishing. By
night the shores would sparkle with house
lights. You might even run across a battle
fleet, because the Pacificans were inveterate
fighters and great imperialists. Their
archipelago included a large number of
empires. You would notice dark objects
being thrown over 'from the battle-fleet
like empty bottles at a river picnic. They
were the rowers, all slaves captured in raids
on the inhabitants of the islands to the
westward. rhey were black, with frizzy
hair, thick lips and negroid noses. You
would observe to your surprise that the
warriors naked bodies were as blanched as
your own. In fact, they could easily be
mistaken for Europeans—face round, head
dome-shaped, ears long, nose aquiline but
flattened at the nostrils, lips thin and a trifle
cruel, chin long and eyes set deep.
On shore you would find the same condi-
iions as at sea. The black, squat negroid
type made the roads, built the temples and
the fields, while the overseers,
officials, soldiers and hordes of male and
female priests were ol the blue-eyed white
race. In between them, engaged in trade
and shopkeeping, were a multitude of half-
castes. If you' had the luck to stumble on
the largest empire in the. group, holding
•sway for a thousand miles in both direc-
tions, you would find a king and court
about at the stage of development of early
Britain./ The monarch—-a true Nordic—
would probably be engaged in selecting 100
oi the fattest citizens for the forthcoming
quarterly sacrifice, in the intervals of dic-
tating instructions for a campaign against
a neighboring empire.
Human sacrifices were probably the foun-
dation of society in Pacifica. The large
birth-rate oi a still virile race constantly
threatened the margin of subsistence, and
by feeding choice portions of the popula-
tion to the fiery furnaces of the volcanoes
the ruler achieved the double purpose of
sta\ mg off the anger of the gods and pre-
serving the standard of living. Of these
insults everything shows that the first was
the more important.
If a thousand years of Pacifica’s long
history could be condensed into an eye-
blink, the great archipelago would be seen
to be in a state of perpetual motion. Islands
would be for ever rising or sinking. Some
would keep going up and going down
several times in succession, carrying down
one civilisation and coming up to provide
accommodation for another. Sometimes a
whole empire would sink except for a few
isolated fragments. The cramped survivors
would literally subsist upon each other for
a while; the most enterprising, would set
out to look for .more land beyond the sun-
set. That in fact appears to have been the
direction of Polynesian migration—from
east to west and not down against the trade
winds from India. In the new lands the
voyagers would forget many of their civil-
ised arts and crafts, but they would still
speak of their lost fatherland as Hawaiki;
and the souls of their dead would go to-
wards the east and dive into the sea to
find it.
If this condensed' way of looking at the
matter could be extended, the archipelago
would be seen on the whole to be gradu-
ally foundering at the same time as the
Andes were rising. At last nothing would
be left but the present waste of waters in
which the infrequent- islet or coral atoll
only serves to emphasise the desolation. On
i lie floating spars, so to speak, surviving
from the wreckage, huddle to-day the last
of the crews, surrounded by the remains of
a civilisation they are too weak and too
harassed to continue. One of these spars
is Ponape, the Pacific Venice, built of huge
stones 20ft. long and 2ft. in diameter; an-
other -,i Easter Island with its mute 70ft.
.stone portrait busts of long-dead heroes.
And how did these Caucasian-looking
aristocrats come into Pacifica? A run of
good seasons in Central Asia was succeeded
by drought. The good seasons attracted
immigrants from Europe to the shores of
the great lakes of Asia. The drought pushed
them out in all directions. Some of them
poured down through China into the
Japanese archipelago. There their Viking
spirit, dormant in the middle of a continent,
reawakened and by now-sunken stepping-
stones they crowded down into the Pacific.
A fate that probably has not its parallel in
history pursued them. Their new oceanic
foothold .sank beneath them, and their
last migration pushed them westward tc
meet a new wave of their race coming via
the Cape in the nineteenth century.
In his fascinating book, “The Riddle of
the Pacific,” Prof. J. Macmillan Brown, of
Christchurch (M.L.), charted the southern
portion of Pacifica. In his Peoples and
Problems of the Pacific (2 vols., Fisher
Unwin), sailing directions for the rest
of the archipelago are now obtainable.
Poets, artists and writers would be well
advised to make the journey.
M.G.S.
“Richard Dehan" and Some Others
When I heard that able and earnest but
somewhat slow-working novelist Richard
Delian had a full-blooded Australian abori-
ginal girl as an attractive and intelligent
heroine in her new novel, my memory and
my mental vision went back to London 40
years ago. Richard Delian, aged about 20,
was a very painstaking person, laboriously
so, and never let imagination run away with
probability; so how came that attractive
and intelligent abo. heroine? But to begin
at the beginning, so far as my personal
recollection is concerned, we will lay the
scene for convenience sake at a definite
place, the time about 1886—I was never
strong on dates. The scene, at any rate, js
certain, the huge auditorium of Drury-lane
Theatre on a Thursday afternoon.
It was a habit in those days, and a useful
one, to give special single performances on
Thursday afternoons at first-rate theatres
for the purpose of testing new plays. Sophie
Eyre, a talented actress who played only
special parts and was not often in the even-
ing bill, was given to this sort of per-
formance. I have already described her
single and never-repeated production of a
play called ‘‘The Love that Kills,” an adap-
tation of “L’Arlesi'enne,” with Bizet’s inci-
dental music, that occasion being memorable
to me on account of my first meeting with
Robert Browning. The occasion I am about
to describe was a trial matinee of a new
ancient Egyptian poetical play in five acts,
entitled “Nitocris,” written by an unknown
dramatist named Clothilde Graves. That
difficult, autocratic manager of Drury-lane,
Augustus Harris, a short, plump, uncultured
Jew, who was nicknamed Augustus Drario-
lanus because of his autocratic manner, had
by some strange freak of fortune been pre-
vailed upon to lend his huge theatre and all
its great resources of scenery, properties
and costumes for this production. At
the end there was a demonstration of appro-
val and repeated cries for “Author!” At
last a tiny figure came on, very com-
posed and quiet, with a small pale face,
fiiir short-cropped hair, blue dressed
like a boy as regards the top‘part of her
thin form, in a dark jacket, waistcoat, shirt,
collar and small black tie, but with a plain
short skirt and neat shoes. That was Clo
Graves, as some of us knew her; but the
audience gasped and then roared with
delight as the small person made a nodding
little bow and disappeared.
Her name appeared on the programme of
the next Drurv-lane pantomime as the
author of some topical songs, and there-
after she seemed to have retired. Married”
Ao, that was scarcely likely. Clo Graves
vas not exact 1> that type—too self-con-
tained and ambitious.
Years afterwards I read a most impres-
sive novel of modern South Africa by a
new writer, Richard Delian. It was “The
Dop Doctor, and I was not surprised that
it became at once a “best seller” and the
most discussed novel of its year, for it was
exceedingly vivid and powerful, though mor-
bid It was so masculine in treatment, so
candid and intimate in its characterisation,
that it was a shock and surprise to hear that
Richard Dehan was a woman, Clotilde
Graves. Then came two other big novels:
t e one was a vivid portraiture of
Bismarck entitled “The Man of Iron”- the
other giving the French view and a portrait
Twn TK e ° n ,F l A x r th T the title “Between
Two Thieves ” When I secured a portrait
of them writer for a book-journal I was
editing in Melbourne, behold! Clo Graves
a stout, matronly-looking woman with

memory-box as a figure of the long-lost
youth of both of us.
To my Cassell’s period belongs also an
eccentric artist who lives for. everybody in
his famous picture of Sydney Carton at the
guillotine, the supreme moment of Charles
Dickens’s “Tale of Two Cities.” This pic-
ture was drawn for a series of photogravure
pictures to be issued in a portfolio by Cas-
sell’s under the title of “Character Sketches
from Dickens.” Fred Barnard had illus-
trated a new edition of the great novelist’s
works and had shown himself a perfect illus-
trator. But there was great difficulty in
securing the drawings for this publication,
and it became my duty to tackle the dila-
tory artist. He was a most eccentric indi-
vidual and my task was no light one,
though full of interest and excitement. He
was a great smoker and was never seen
without being enveloped in clouds of smoke
of extreme pungency. He also possessed an
irascible temper and a vocabulary of
curse words exceedingly varied and expres-
sive. I suspected him of coining some of
them spontaneously. He was tall and thin,
very dark, and looked like his own portrait
of Alfred Jingle with the added attraction
of a rugged beard, and he had a good deal
of Jingle’s grim humor. When he did work
it was with great rapidity and sureness of
touch, and I have watched him do a draw-
ing in about an hour, for I would some-
times wait to take one away with me rather
than risk leaving it to chance. Barnard was
true to himself at the very end, for he was
burnt to death in his bed at a friend’s house,
having fallen asleep, after a gay evening,
while smoking his pipe.
A more famous man of my acquaintance
(I knew him much more intimately than
Barnard) was also tall and thin, but fair,
grey-eyed and clean-shaved. This was
Herbert Beerbohm Tree, then starting his
career as a manager as well as leading-actor.
He lived in a flat up a long narrow flight
of stairs, in a house behind which was a
livery stables, with his wife and two little
daughters. He had the habit of toning him-
self up with a few drops of strychnine in
water. He was very lively and inordinately
vain of his talents, which were not great,
though he had a good sense of eccentric
character and a great gift of make-up. He
had a very poor opinion of Henry Irving,
into whose shoes he was impatient to step
and eventually did, though they fitted him
but ill. He was a German by birth but
with no noticeable accent; he told me his
uncle was the famous General Pape, and
that he had a younger brother whom he
called Julius, and whom he expected to
make a big name for himself. He did have
a brother who later became famous, but his
name was Max Beerbohm. The “Tree” was
an assumed name of the actor’s, and when
he was knighted years afterwards he dropped
the German patronymic and became Sir
Herbert Tree.
EDWARD A. VIDLER.
Roy Bridges
A small boy of my acquaintance once
said to me: “I would like to meet Roy
Bridges. He must be a big man because
he writes such bonser pirate yarns. And I
think he’s a sailor.” If hero worship
depends on illusion, I sincerely hope the
small boy never meets Roy Bridges—any-
how, until such time as picturesque pirate
yarns do not fill such a big niche in his
life. I had a similar illusion of Bridges,
largely caused through his vigorous color-
filled boys’ romances. But when first I met
him I was not so disappointed as would have
been the average Australian boy to whom
Bridges has become what Ellis with his Red
Indian stories was to the American boy,
and A. G. Henty with his romantic his-
torical yarns is to the British boy. Roy
Bridges is a small, sturdy man, with a
highly-strung nervous system reflected in
his dark eyes and general bearing. The
boy would have been terribly disappointed.
There were compensations for me, as I had
read more than his boys’ romances; had
drunk of the deeper romance and color
in his novels. And Bridges is not a sailor,
except that he ploughs the seas of romantic
fiction in his well-freighted ship. When first
I met him he was in the throes of a political
crisis for a Melbourne daily newspaper, and
doing the work with as much zest and as
capably as he writes his novels.
A man of about 40, with a passion for his
■work for the sake of the work; to whom the
story is the thing. The literary philosophy
of Bridges might well be summed up in this
way—the subjugation of everything to the
story in hand. He makes no pretence of
being a teacher. He is the storyteller first
and last and all the time. A graduate of
Hobart University, he first began writing in
1910. when he started to develop his slant
for historical romance. Tasmania, with its
colorful if gruesome past, furnish him with
the material. Coming of a pioneer family
with much first-hand knowledge of the early
days of Tasmanian settlement, and having
lived all his boyhood and youth in the city
that has more of romance of this sort in
it than any other in Australia, he possibly
could not help but turn to those days for
his theme. His earlier stories were published
in Australia. He, however, soon realised
that the material gain from stories pub-
lished locally was poor recompense for the
labor involved. Hence the great mass of
his work has been published in England
and America.
In the last few years he has sent out
not less than a dozen novels. Romance
has been the theme of most of them, with
a streak of stark realism that is in many in-
stances not beautiful, but impressive be-
cause of the evident sincerity of the author.
His later works, notably his last novel,
“Mirror of Silver,” are stamped with this
grimness, unrelieved by any light except
for a graphic sincerity of landscape-furnish-
ing. With his obvious dramatic gifts and
his possession of great narrative facility, it
is regrettable that he does not essay some-
thing that would reflect more the life of this
country.
It is as a writer of boys’ adventure yarns
that he appears more to relish his task,
is more the true artist, and certainly is more
appealing to the reader. Such yarns as
“Rats’ Castle,” “Dead Men’s Gold,” “The
Pirates’ Hoard” and “The Black House” are
as picturesque as their titles, and as worthy
of inclusion on a boys’ bookshelf as “Trea-
sure Island.”
Some day Bridges may realise that in
the writing of these picturesque novels lies
his greatest strength and charm. If he
does he will not again essay grim studies
of heredity such as “Mirror of Silver,”
or grim psychological studies such as “Gates
of Birth,” but will stick fast to the broader,
more colorful canvas the boys’ romance
allows; with resultant applause from an
army of boys, not confined to Australia,
to whom he is a giant among men.
C. E. SAYERS.
The City that Lost Its Jews
The philosopher who said that every
country gets the Jews it deserves made a
severe condemnation of some of the semi-
anarchistic States of Eastern Europe; it
occurred to Hugo Bettauer to picture a
city which thought that it did not deserve
to have any Jews at all. The exiles of
Palestine have spread themselves most re-
markably over the earth from Spitzbergen
to Cow Flat; and if Bettauer had wanted
to make the lofties^ possible flight of imagi-
nation as to what is likely to happen to
a city which got rid of its Jews he would
have pitched his tent in New York, where
the Cohens outnumber even the Smiths.
Being an Austrian, he chose Vienna.
The City Without Jews was not planned
by the author as a political essay; Bet-
tauer’s idea was to write an imaginative
story based on a popular agitation in which
he could display his whimsicalitj' and keen
sense of humor. It was immediately
accepted as a political pamphlet, however,
especially in Germany, where 250,000 copies
were sold in one year; translated into Eng-
lish, and published in America by the Bloch
Publishing Co. of New York, it proved a
similar good seller, the sales being lifted
by its introduction into the controversy
raised by the anti-Semitism of Henry Ford,
who, incidentally, has himself been alleged
to be of Jewish descent. All this should
have been very cheering to the author,
but that a zealous 20-year-old German, who
was obsessed with the theory of Nordic
domination, had already murdered him.
Just how Vienna has felt about its Jews
was indicated when, upon the assembly of
the last Zionist Congress, the Government,
which had invited the congress to meet
there, had to turn out an army for its
protection. There was rioting in spite of
that precaution. The Jews in Vienna are
accused, by those who hate them, of all
sorts of ill deeds; their real offence is
apparently their efficiency. Thus there is a
powerful students’ movement to limit the
number of Jews who may attend Austrian
universities —and that seems to be wholly
inspired by the fact that they win most
of the honors. Yet the city’s anti-Semitism,
although demonstrative, was not strong
enough to maintain a theatre formed to
cater for its prejudice a year ago. The
theatre’s principle was that no Jewish plays
should be staged, no Jewish players or
musicians employed, and no Jews admitted
to the audience. It went bankrupt two
months ago.
Bettauer’s fantasy opens with the intro-
duction of a law expelling all Jews, even
those who have accepted Christianity, in-
cluding the offspring of “mixed” marriages,
six months being allowed for the Chosen
to make themselves scarce. Trouble starts
immediately. Herr Schneuzel. having en-
thusiastically voted for the bill in Parlia-
ment, is reminded that his son-in-law, a
converted Jew, and his grandchildren will
have to go. His is a common consternation
amongst patriots who overlooked their
family ties with people whose Jewish origin
had been forgotten. Famous physicians,
poets, novelists, composers and professors
have to quit. The city might have been
able to manage well enough without its
closed theatres, but feels the blow keenly
when some of its best cafes disappear; and
the general merchants are hurt by an amaz-
ing slump in business. Even the Govern-
ment seizure of Jewish property doesn’t
prevent the krone from a nasty fall. An
anti-Jewish paper is crippled by the heavy
losses of its staff; and the R.C. Archbishop,
Cardinal Rossel, is disconsolate at the loss
of relations who have married people
tainted with Jewish blood.
The disappearance of the Hakenkreuzler
organisation is amongst the happenings. It
is the official enemy of the Jew; and with
the disappearance of the Jew the joy of
being an enemy has vanished also. There
is slv humor in the suggestion that some
of its leaders were forced out in the exodus.
This and the deplorable condition into
which the city falls are the main factors
in the repeal of the law to which all the
trouble is due. The negotiations for the
repeal are worked out humorously; the
author, a Protestant with no trace of Jewish
blood, makes a fine job of handling the
Jewish capacity for bargaining.
Fortunately it is difficult in Australia to
understand the intense racial prejudice and
hatred upon which the story is built.
Bettauer’s murder, no less than the enor-
mous circulation of his book, shows how
seriously the Jewish question is still re-
garded in many parts of this distracted
world.

Novels Worth Reading
This list has been compiled by a com-
mittee of judges nominated by the Associ-
ated Booksellers of Australia and Maori-
land. It is issued to serve as a reliable
guide to fiction ot merit.
Hooks of Literary Merit— The Woman
Who Stole Everything, by Arnold Bennett;
Out of the Ruins, by Sir Philip Gibbs;
Meanwhile, by LI. G. Wells.
Hooks for Popular Reading. —The Case
Book of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir A. Conan
Doyle; The Man Behind the Curtain, by J.
M. Walsh ; The Flower Show, by Denis
McKail; The Thunderer, by E. Barrington ;
The Golden Pool, by R. A. Freeman; Fair
Game, by Olive Wadsley: Rubies, by Louis
Moresby (L. Adams Beck) ; On the Right
Wrists, by Armstrong Finney.
A Satchel of Books
U c of the Never-Never, by Mrs. Tineas
Gunn (Robertson and Mullens). A one:and-
sixpenny adaptation of the famous epic of
the Northern Territory for use m schools.
Worth a whole bagful ot imported textbooks.
About, England, by M. V. Hughes (Dent),
An attempt to get the Englishman to see
his own country as others see it. What the
child of John Bull wants, says the author,
“is a fresh eye-—the eye of a stranger.” An
informative little book.
The Persistent Heritage, by E. Tait-Reid
(Heifer). Readers of “Mareeya” will be
glad to learn from this sequel that Donald
Fleming, who had loved and lost that eapri-
cions young lady, found consolation in the
arms of her daughter after that tempera-
I, 1,, i
mental young person had passed through the
waters of matrimonial tribulation with a
Russian named Domiloff. An experiment
that might easily furnish material for a third
novel.
Employers’ Endowment Tax, by Norman
Bede Rydge (Law Book Co.). This book
is an explanation by its compiler, a taxation
specialist and public accountant who lias
written previous works on land and income
taxation, of the exact liability of employers
under the N.S.W. Finance (Family Endow-
ment Tax) Act 1927 and the Family Endow-
ment Act 1927. Who, under the provisions
of this legislation, are “employers,” who
“employees,” and what classes of payments
constitute “wages” are questions of vital
importance to all persons who may come
within the taxation area. Later on, when
tile experimental measure has been tested
over a considerable period of time, a more
authoritative textbook will be called for;
meantime, all who are affected by the new
tax will find this clearly-expressed and
well-reasoned manual a valuable source of
reference.
Call of the House, by Ruth Comfort Mit-
chell (Appleton). Doria l)ian Yale, the
first woman Senator of her State, went up
to the Capitol “with an open mind and an
open heart, pledged to the best interests of
her people and the dictates of her own clear
conscience.” Engulfed in politics she comes
up against the political boss. Conscience
points one way, the imperious finger of the
boss the other. “You say you have weighed
and balanced—you cannot possibly know,
never having been through it, what it means
to go against your group, your backing, your
constituents.” How Doria, disillusioned,
survived the test makes the theme of an
original and interesting story.
Mysteries, by Knut Hamsun (Knopf;
Robertson and Mullens). Th e Norwegian
Nobel prize winner continues to demonstrate
his proposition that the individual human
being is condemned from birth to solitary
confinement within his ego, the bread and
water of his lonely dreams being his only
nourishment. The slow story contains much
tedious description of middle-class existence
in a small Scandinavian town, but out of it
grows a powerful figure, that of Nagel, who
sets the town agog with his apparently queer
doings. Hamsun deftly shows the rational
motives for his acts committed in the isola-
tion of his soul. Suicide was the only fea-
sible end for such a man, and he is duly
suicided. Dagny, the girl who can under-
stand neither him nor herself, is Hamsun’s
best female portrait to date.
An Australian Looks at America, by H.
G. Adams (Cornstalk Co.). The author,
who is associate editor of the Herald, Mel-
bourne, accompanied the delegation sent by
the Commonwealth Government to study
American industrial conditions; and as the
representative of a group of enterprising news-
papers his inquiries extended beyond the
official records and other prepared material
•placed before the delegation. He found the
trade unionism of the States a very different
institution from that of Australia. “Union-
ism in America,” he says, “is not a political
creed or a social movement; it is the group-
ing of workers in different trades to obtain
practical advantages for their own trade;
but no group is anxious that its advantages
should bo extended to the others. Cheap
labor helps to pay the wages of dear labor.
If there were too many unionists in America,
high wages would have to come down as low
wages went up.” Man is still a necessary in-
strument in production, but the huge profits
coming from the machine enable a high
reward to be paid to its attendant slave.
Incidentally the writer calls attention to an
evil that is subtly creeping into Australian
life. It has already got a strong grip on
the States. An American sociologist
described it as “the insolvency of the nation’s
homes,” and ventured to estimate that on a
sudden foreclosing 80 per cent, of the middle-
class homes in America would be found to
be insolvent. This system of pledging weekly
wages for goods on the time-payment system
“is creeping over the country like tuber-
culosis.”

The Rune-maker.
I am the lame rune-maker,
With the scar and tin l crooked liip ;
But J carve my magic verses
On the prow of the dragon-ship!
Deep on the planks of the ash-tree,
Deep on tin* painted sides—
And the good ship sails in the favor
Of the gods of the winds and tides!
Safe from the coiled sea-serpent,
From the trolls that haunt the sea,
With Ran and her nine white daughters
To guard from the ills that he!
I am the lame rune-maker!
I sit and warm my bones,
When the great striped sail is hoisted,
By the crackling fir-trees’ cones.
I am the lame rune-maker,
Long done my warlike part!
The spear-liead rusts —but the runes are
Carved deep on my naked heart!

A Ballad of Speed.
From Lunadale to Lostascrew
He drove his car ;
And nought of all the way he knew,
Except that it was far.
From Lunadale to Lostascrew
The road was very flat;
And lush and full the grasses grow
To make the cattle fat.
But half the way to Lostascrew
r i'here stood a yellow tree
And, by the stream, a girl in blue
Had comfits on her knee.
Her back was turned to Lostascrew;
The taste was in her mouth
Of pipkins, red in northland dew,
And almonds of the south.
The bakers’ shops of Lostascrew
Hold nothing half so sweet;
For far and far away she flew
With feathers on her feet,
Beyond the roads of Lostascrew,
Beyond the meads of grace.
With fifty thousand leagues of new
Delight upon her face.
From Lunadale to Lostascrew
What matters fast or slow?
The happy things a heart can do
A wheel can never know !

The Sea and Women.
What magic has the Sea upon us laid
That we must love her and our souls be
swayed
With her old glamor—oh, though we are
held
In the dear ways of peace, we are compelled
To love the austere beauty of great ships,
And suddenly in some green tide that lips
A yellow beach, a stair, a crumbling wall
To hear strange, half-forgotten longings call.
Lo, these are in our longings: purple fields
Swept by the wind ; a coral reef that yields
Color on color blossoming to light;
Deep emerald waves, and all the weaving,
white,
Unresting foam; and the ice-ridden, blue
Far northern spaces the Valkyries knew;
Grey, circling gulls; the Dawn in sapphire
stoled
Walking a floor of ebony and gold.
And all the sails of lordly ships that glide
Adown. the age-old roads in goodly pride
Bear out with them our dreams, frail dreams
that go
Far o’er the purple fields with light aglow;
And when the great masts rear against the
stars
And starlight glimmers down the shrouds
and spars,
Some singing girl whose body lies asleep
Fares out in dream on the enchanted deep.
Oh, we must ever hear, heart-stirred must
hear,
Her low voice calling even while we fear
To yield and follow where are lonely
things—
Great clouds and calms, the silver flash of
wings,
And on the blue rim no blue rising land....
Stronger than ever men may understand
The bond is, though but wrought of fantasy,
Betwixt the souls of women and the Sea.
FIJI.

I Made Me a Song.
I made me a song once
To sweeten a
And then to forget it,
Lest wisdom come scorning
The trifle; but now ’tis
The pride of my days.
Since love looked upon it,
And love gave it praise.
I made me a song once,
And little fame caught it,
And made it a chaplet
For me who had wrought it;
But oh! there are thorns in
The wearing for me;
I made it for love, and
My love did not see.

In the Night.
In the chill darkness of the dragging hours,
Clear through the dripping rain,
T hear above the soughing of the wind
A ghost-hand at the pane.
A little hand that taps and hesitates,
Then gently taps once more,
As craving entrance for someone who shuns
Latched gate and close-barred door.
The midnight hour chimes from a distant
tower,
Black silence fills the room,
1 creep across the floor and fearfully
Look through the windy gloom.
Down in the garden lilies tall and white
Sway with a silvern, gleam ;
The roses, pallid in the stars’ cold light,
Droop in a rain-drenched dream.
A little ghost is in the night; it roams
The chill world restlessly.
I hear its sighing in the wind, its plaint
Comes from the murmuring tree.
“Out in the friendless dark I wait and weep
Until the white stars wane,”
And then there comes, close to my trembling
hand,
The tapping at the pane.
Only, you say, the ivy at the sill—■
Naught but a wandering vine?
But I have heard the little, sorrowing voice
So piteously repine,
I cannot rest while this lone spirit weeps
In anguished grief apart;
How may I sleep when this small helpless
hand
Comes tapping at my heart?

The Runners.
Where are we going? We care not, we know
not;
Only the road is delight to our feet.
Best at the end of it azure mists show not,
And what does it matter? The race to the
fleet!
Hills of achievement we inly surmise;
But the wind of our running is sweet on our
eyes.
Others go prudently, testing and choosing,
Walking in tracks sober sandals have worn.
Stooping for unvalued gems we are losing.
Tossing us counsel of pity and scorn.
Let them sit by the wayside and cuddle their
prize;
The wind of our running is sweet on our eyes.
Swiftness, adventure, hope’s rainbow
resilience,
Are these not fair, you blind gatherers of
gold?
Our heads are crowned with the morning s
pure brilliance.
Haloed with youth that can never grow old.
We empty-handed are rich and most wise
While the wind of our running is sweet ou
our eyes.
Linked by the oneness of tireless endeavor,
We are the comrades, the faithful, the
real;
Each of us dreaming and striving for ever
Chases in secret a different ideal.
But be it the highest or maddest emprise
The wind of our running is sweet on our
eyes.
Fierce, cleansing wind, whose ecstatic
resistance
Rings through our heart-strings with music
like flame!
Road that speeds into the darling blue
distance
Challenging always, and always the same!
God, may I die, so my daily prayers rise.
With the wind of my running still sweet on
my eyes.

In the Gale’s Teeth.
Harried by a south gale,
Hustled hither, thither —
Say, my friend, what folly
Led or drove us hither?
By hoarse breakers standing
Side by side together,
We that are sun-lovers
Little like this weather.
Better home and hearth-warmth
Than yon sea a-welter
With wild waves and spindrift
Flying helter-skelter.
Than this icy vastness
Chilling mind and marrow,
Better any shelter
Howsoever narrow.
We that are sun-lovers
Welcome, as a comer,
Bringing life and lustre,
Golden-hearted summer.
’Neath this cliff that, spray-drenched,
Seaward blindly gazes.
In the gale’s teeth let us
Shout bright summer’s praises.

Does Quality Pay?
P OR example, an Armstrong Whitworth loco-
motive may reasonably be expected to give
20 years or half a million miles of useful
service.
On the other hand a locomotive in which quality
of workmanship and material has been sacrificed
to initial cheapness, is likely to be continually in
the repair shops and to be scrapped finally after a
few short years of poor service.
Quality does pay, whether you consider loco-
motives, ships or twist drills, in fact in all
engineering work, and the quality of Armstrong
Whitworth products great or small is acknow-
edged as a standard by engineers throughout
the world.

THE “EXPANSION AND DEVELOP-
MENT” MYTH.
The foreign debt increase argument does
not appeal to me. So long as the capital
which we get from abroad is used for expan-
sion and development it is in an entirely
different category from an ordinary national
debt.” —Federal Arbitration Judge Beery.
“The Australian Railways Union has no
desire to control the railways under the
existing system of society, as it would be
saddled with the huge interest bill that has
been built up by the Tory controllers of the.
railways. Mr. McCormack regards that
interest bill as of more importance than the
wages of the working class.” —President
Rymer of the A.R.U. holding forth in Bris-
bane.
The two speakers represent diverse types
of toiler in the same vineyard. The legal
gentleman stands for the large, stereotyped
class which doesn’t deal in new ideas, or
trouble itself with fresh information, or
anticipate any serious change in its placid
■ life. It finds the big loan habit as easy and
comfortable as did the Regency type of
Irish landlord, who lived royally but un-
tidily until the Encumbered Estates Court,
by way of a hint, sold up some few thou-
sand properties for the benefit of innumer-
able creditors; or the French financiers, and
nobles, and kings, and kings’ semi-official
wives in late pre-Revolution days; or Ismail
and his harem just before Egypt was taken
over by the official assignees. It assures
itself that all is well so long as its salary
comes in regularly. On the other hand, the
rather illegal gentleman voices the senti-
ments of the class which looks forward
hopefully to a vast insolvency and revolu-
tion and confiscation on Moscow principles,
and is pleased that persons like the legal
gentleman, whom it expects to enslave,
should lend a hand towards the insolvency.
Capable assistants in the cause are indus-
trial agitators who want local production
reduced so that they may work less, and
traders who desire the same thing so that
they may import more. Both help along
the surplus of imports which makes foreign
loans necessary.

The story about loan money being re-
served for permanent and productive works
was never wholly true, but of late years
it has been a lie and an insult to the human
understanding. It still gains currency be-
cause many people make comparatively
little use of their human understanding.
During the peace years June, 1919, to June,
1926, the six States added to their peace
debts about £242,000,000. The expenditure,
ascertained from Federal books of refer-
ence, presents this aspect:—
STATE LOAN EXPENDITURE, 1919 TO 1926.
On railways (including State-owned
tramways) mostly in localities where
there were railways and consequently
votes already. They pay so badly
that the big loss remains and often
grows .. .. .. .. .. £67,000,000
On repurchase of private land and other
“settlement” expenses. This gener-
ally meant buying Jones, who was
often free of debt and successful, off
the land and putting on Smith, who
started with an impossible mortgage,
and was often an amateur to boot.
One visible result was that the area
under crop in 1926 was less than in
1910 65,500,000
On roads, bridges, public buildings,
including schools, water supply,
sewerage, water conservation, harbors,
rivers, development of mines and
mineral resources, immigration, loans
to local bodies, rabbit-proof fencing.. 89,500,000
On oddments so odd that they fit into
none of the above numerous categories 30,000,000
£242,000,000
The proportion of alleged assets to the
total is naturally a changeful panorama. In
1900 State railways represented, at cost.
£65 7s. lid. out of every £lOO of debt; in
1919 they represented £5B 6s. per £100; in
1926 only £45 13s. The land-jobbing securi-
ties, which begin to look as if they were
no security at all in many places, repre-
sented £4 9s. sd. per cent, in 1919 and £l2
Is. per cent, in 1926. The oddments, which
may be taken to include the losses made
by floating loans at' a discount, stood as
security for £4 17s. 7d. per. cent, of the
State liabilities 1919 and £8 7s. 4d. per
cent, in 1926. So the seven years have been
a time of rapid degeneration, and the
accounts for 1927, which will make the
situation much worse, aren’t in yet. Natur-
ally, the element which regards national
insolvency as the road to revolution con-
siders the situation very promising.

“The capital which we get from abroad,”
of which Beebys and other platitudinarians
speak so light-heartedly, has now only an
accidental connection with “expansion and
development.” It is measured solely by
the amount which Australia must have at
its credit abroad in any particular year to
pay bills, almost entirety those for interest
and surplus imports. As a matter of fact,
even in a year like 1925-26, when £39,000,000
was raised abroad, it stayed abroad unani-
mously. The idea that “we get it” from
there is a happy fiction. Of course a
schedule of alleged productive expenditure
is cooked up to explain the loans. Judg-
ing from the growth of the dubious items
in the schedule, the production of a plaus-
ible-looking financial hash has become very
difficult. The need for real gold money
for foreign liabilities, instead of merety
money for local “expansion and develop-
ment,” which our own paper currency can
effect well enough, can be shown by this
comparison:—
Average Per Average Per
Annum from Annum from
1919 to 1923. 1923 to 1926.
Borrowed abroad .. £17,090,326 £30,043,303
Borrowed locally .. 33,205,469 6,041,401
£50,295,795 £36,084,704
Australia (in its State and Commonwealth
capacity) didn’t want so much more foreign
(gold) money per annum in the second
period than in the first because the schedule
of public works was larger. That schedule
was realty much smaller. But the unfavor-
able balance of trade, which appears to
have become permanent, had eaten up this
country’s credit balances abroad, and real
money was wanted, not only to prevent
Australia being put on the list of bankrupts,
like Turkey, but to pay for the imported
machinery and drapery and motor-cars and
motor spirit and whisky and other appa-
ratus. of good living.'
ROGUES OR FOOLS—WHICH?
Every week or so the Sydney. Worker.
Government supporter though it is, demands
a Parliamentary inquiry into the totalisator
mystery for which the N.S.W. Govern-
ment is wholly responsible. In an effort to
increase the tote revenue, so the announce-
ment went, the Lang Administration
abandoned the 60-20-20 p.c. method of dis-
tributing dividends for a queer 50-30-20 p.c.
arrangement, the amounts staked by the
backers of placed horses having been sepa-
rated from the pool. Under the old system
the public at least made its own odds and
knew pretty well what the tote would pay;
under the Lang system dividends are in-
calculable until the race is run, and then
they are so unsatisfactory, except in rare
cases, that thousands of punters have de-
serted the machine for the bookmaker,
particularly the shop variety. At the last
Randwick meeting, for example, there was
a drop of £14,535 in totalisator “invest-
ments” as compared with the same meeting
last year; the amounts were £31,480 in 1927
and £46,015 in 1926. At 9 p.c. the Govern-
ment lost £l3OB that one day. There was
no public demand for the alteration, and
what has happened in consequence of it was
predicted by racing clubs, newspapers and
punters alike. The Worker suggests that
the new method is so glaringly in the in-
terests of bookmakers that an investigation
is necessary to determine whether or not
bookmakers inspired it.
'•* ■!’ •!' *!»
A Parliamentary inquiry is warranted, but
it should not be confined to one feature of
the Government’s administration of the
betting laws. There are others more im-
portant—the tin-hare business, for instance.
An attempt was made in the Gaming and
Betting Amendment Bill to secure legisla-
tive authority for betting on dogs pursuing
the tin hare. This authority was refused,
the clause being struck out by the Leg.
Council with the concurrence of the other
House. A betting license was nevertheless
issued to a Sydney company headed by a
shrewd American gentleman, and it has led
to such vast crowds of gamblers—many of
them women and children—attending the
company’s electric-light meetings that the
American gentleman has made a consider-
able fortune in a few months. Many more
licenses have been bestowed on promoters
of other tin-hare companies—mostly book-
makers and the like—for use in various
parts of N. S. Wales. They are remark-
able for other things than the over-riding
of the decision of Parliament, for tin-hare
bookmakers are exempt from the betting
taxes imposed on those who field at horse-
and pony-races; moreover, there are no re-
strictions as to the number of meetings or
the time of day at which they may be held,
although there are restrictions on the great
non-proprietary A.J.C. A Sydney magi-
strate has shocked the tin-hare gentry and
their patrons by ruling that dog-racing is
not coursing within the meaning of the Act
and fining a bookmaker accordingly. But
a Government so contemptuous of Parlia-
ment and of the moral and economic
aspects of tin-hare gambling at night may
be relied upon to get over that, if it can
contrive to keep in office.
❖ * H* #
There is a case for inquiry also in the
night-trotting business. Without the con-
sent of the Legislature night trotting has
burst upon a betting-cursed State. It is
announced that a speculator “who received
a license some months ago, and intended to
hold trotting meetings at Maroubra, but
had his plans upset by a decision of the
Metropolitan Land Board, has now received
from the Government a license that permits
him to hold meetings on any licensed race-
course.” So if the mothers for whom Lang’s
heart bleeds have any child-endowment
money left after they have been to the dogs
(barring accidents there will be four dog
meetings per week in Sydney presently, as
well as four horse and pony meetings),
they will be able to do it in at the “trots.”
P. J. Minahan, Labor M.L.A. for Sydney,
contends that “the leaders of the Labor
party should be forced to disclose the
quantity of campaign funds they hold in
trust and the names of those who con-
tributed them.” He alleges that £30,000
was paid to get the Liquor Bill passed “at
top speed.” Perhaps the Worker would be
willing to let this matter go before its
Parliamentary tribunal also. Certainly the
public would like to know whether the
Labor Government gave all these valuable
concessions for nothing.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Riddle of Rent.
Said Justice Ferguson in a judgment de«
livered in the Full Court relative to the
Fair Rents Act of N. S. Wales:—
“It is most unfortunate, in a matter touch-
ing closely the daily lives of many thou-
sands in the community, that their legal
rights and liabilities, instead of being clearly
defined by the statute that lias so materially
altered the Common law, should be left to
be ascertained by costly litigation, especially
when it is considered that the Act is ex-
pressly designed to apply to people of a class
to whom the cost of litigation is often pro-
hibitive.”
The original Act was passed during the
exceptional economic conditions caused by
the Great War. It purported to follow the
example set by the British Parliament in
a measure which was distinctly one of
emergency and which, it is anticipated, will
expire with the present year. The N.S.W.
legislation was also put forward as a war
measure to be later on discontinued. It
has, as a matter of fact, ceased to have any
war significance at all and has become a
piece of standard legislation amended twice,
in 1920 and 1926, imposing more drastic
conditions—and always on the landlord—
than were deemed necessary in war time.
Rudely drafted in the first instance, all
its imperfections and injustices were per-
petuated by the Act of 1926 passed by the
present Government in the earlier days of
its misrule. The denial of any appeal from
a court working on a hard formula, like a
piece of soulless mechanism, was continued.
Not one of the inequitable conditions and
burdens was lifted, not one of its school-
boy errors was corrected. The clear, un-
mistakable object of the Lang amending
legislation was to hit owners of house and
shop property so viciously that in effect
they ceased to be masters of their own pro-
perty without means of redress. As his
Honor pointed out in his commentary, a
landlord may be placed in such a position
that so long as a tenant sees fit to retain
possession of the rented premises he may
practically defy the owner to remove him
—and it is even doubtful if he is in certain
circumstances under any obligation to pay
rent. The English legislation did do some-
thing to protect the landlord, but the pro-
tective sections of the English Act have
been—it is a fair presumption—deliberately
omitted from the N.S.W. Act.
Like so much Labor legislation, this body
of class law is as full of legal difficulties of
interpretation as wire-netting is of holes.
Without knowledge, experience or foresight,
the Labor Government has forced this and
similar class legislation with bull-headed
obstinacy through a Legislative Assembly
that was denied the right either to deliber-
ate or to legislate, in any true sense. “There
has not been a single section of the Act
referred to in the argument of this case,”
said the Judge, “which does not preseni
difficult problems of mere interpretation.”
The Lang . measure which extended the
octopus grip of the Act to shops and in-
creased its hold on dwelling houses was
smashed through the Assembly regardless
of legal or any other consequences. Either
the responsible Minister was ignorant of the
measure he sponsored, and its patent defects
and inequities, or he was callously indiffer-
ent to them. It is on a par with the body
of legislation this inept and blundering
Government has bundled through with un-
skilled hands—a newspaper tax that tumbled
to pieces for want of constitutionality, a
Workmen’s Compensation Act full of crude
and unworkable legislation, a Family En-
dowment Act that imposes a tax without a
penalty to secure its payment and to
recover sixpenn’orth of which resort must
be had to a Small Debts Court without
power to allow costs.
If a Nationalist Government is returned
to try to save this unfortunate and mis-
governed State, one of its first acts in
putting a very dirty house in order will
be to realise the hope of Justice Ferguson
that the many “patent defects” of the Fair
Rents Act “will be the subject of early
amending legislation.”
O
The Cash-order Vulture.
“A Victim”: As a small shopkeeper I was
very interested in the remarks (B. 15/9/’27)
about the “cash-order vulture.” If the
public knew that the shopkeeper receives
only 17s. 6d. for every 20s. worth of goods
supplied to cash-order customers, and has
to wait two months for his cheque, it
might see how this pest increases the cost
of living; and not only to the improvident
who use the cash orders, but to the cash
buyer as well. Put in other words, when a
customer hands me a 20s. cash order, I
know that two months hence I will get
17s. 6d. for it. How can the customer ex-
pect to get 20s. worth of goods for his 20s.
order in those circumstances? Of course
he can’t. He is lucky if he gets 17s. worth.
Although the storekeeper finds his profits
shrinking and watches other traders forced
to give up business, he is driven to accept
these orders because they have become
largely the currency of the people; and if
he belongs to a shopkeepers’ association,
he is liable to find that members of its
executive are directors or partners in cash-
order businesses, and assistance from that
quarter is out of the question. In view of
this state of affairs, it is refreshing to find
that in N. S. Wales the Country Traders are
taking active steps to rid themselves of both
the cash-order and trading-coupon menace;
after competing with the drought, long
credit and the mail-order houses, they find
they simply cannot stand the further drain
on their profits.
In view of the coming N.S.W. elections
there is a great chance for Mr. Bavin and
Mr. Buttenshaw to secure 95 p.c. of the
votes of shopkeepers and their wives by
announcing a policy of extinction for all
cash-order concerns.
♦
Bribery and Corruption? Certainly Not!
Mr. Lang is an honorable man—they are
all honorable men. All that happens is
that there are times when a Government
can see better what a person or a district
needs.
Take the case of Goulburn (N.S.W.) for
example. For years it never seemed to be
able to persuade Labor that it needed any-
thing. Then Labor fluked a win there;
and now the Windy City can’t open its
mouth without a Minister dropping a plum
into it.
Beginning with small favors such as
“owing to representations made by Mr.
Tully, M.L.A., Goulburn concert parties
will be conveyed to and from the gaol free
of cost.” the process has steadily increased
until now—within a week or two of polling
day, as it happens—the announcements of


Mr. Tully’s success in obtaining gifts for
Goulburn take up such a lot of space that
even important developments in the tin-
hare industry have to be “held over” for
lack of space. In a recent issue of a local
paper it required half a column to schedule
the latest batch of plums obtained by Mr.
Tully, M.L.A., all of which are to be
handed out “immediately” or “at the
earliest possible date.”
But the grant of £SOO for the completion
of the Goulburn War Memorial road is
such a belated favor that the Minister for
Local Government felt it necessary to
naively explain to the bewildered electors
that the cash is only granted “in view of
the special circumstances surrounding this
case.” The special circumstances referred
to are more peculiar than special. When
Lang rushed up 200 men from Sydney last
month, just in the nick of time to get their
names on the Goulburn roll, the local un-
employed, who expected the work on the
road job that was given to the 200 Sydney
votes, made such a disturbance that Mr.
Tully had to scratch gravel to find work
for at least the noisiest of them. Hence
the re-opening of the railway quarries and
the making of the War Memorial road.
Exactly how much every seat won by
Mr. Lang at the coming election will cost
the people no man knows or ever will
know; but if it is put at a hundred thousand
pounds it will be very much underesti-
mated.
A Great Job for the Other Fellow.
The cutting up of large estates is always
reckoned a fine thing to advocate at election
time. The city dweller in particular has a
vague idea that the slicing of large areas
into small areas must spell progress—he
has probably arrived at this conclusion
through listening to suburban subdivision
experts. Apart from this, however, the
average city dweller has a fixed oinnion
that the land is a grand occupation, and any-
thing that tends to settle the other fellow
on a farm has his approval; indeed, he
feels that he is performing an almost
religious duty in getting somebody else to
“take to the soil.” The country dweller,
for his part, unless he happens to be himself
the holder of a large estate, has a theory
that it would do old Woolbales the world
of good to be thrown open, and cut up, and
chucked out. The country dweller arrives
at this conclusion, not through his know-
ledge of the merits of the case, but through
the operation of the old human failing of
envy.
The truth about closer settlement is that
we have had a great deal too much of it
in the wrong places. The periods of most
tremendous effort in the closer settling line
show always a definite decline in the num-
ber of rural toilers, either immediately or
soon afterwards. People do not drift to
the city because they have too much land
nor yet because they have none at all, but.
in nine cases out of ten because they have
had too little land, and have been in conse-
quence disheartened and discouraged.
The awful failure of the soldier-settlement
business proved that people should be per-
mitted to settle themselves. We do not try
to force them to manufacture lawnmowers
or wheelbarrows. Why should we try to
force them to grow things? Incidentally,
in the case of soldier-settlement, much has
been said of the loss it caused to the'coun-
try; mighty little has been said about the
loss sustained by the poor duped warriors.

Digger Discipline.
“Centurion”: John Monash, sometime
G.O.C. Australian forces in France, told a
Melbourne audience the other day that the
fatuous charges of indiscipline so often
brought against the Australian soldier were
arrant nonsense. But the tale will take a
lot of contradicting at this late hour, and
the impression has been fostered by the
sardonic Digger’s ingrained habit of leg-
pulling whenever an account of his doings
in the A.I.F. is demanded of him by some
persistent bore. Monash went on to point
out, in illustration of his contention that
the Digger discipline was the most un-
shakable of all, that, while serious dis-
turbances had occurred after the Armistice
in British, French, TJ.S. and even Canadian
units, there were no such blots on the Aus-
tralian record. As far as the writer’s experi-
ence goes, there can be no question about
the matter at all, and this applies to the
parade ground variety of discipline as well
as that of the firing line, in which the Digger
admittedly excelled. Gullett, in his history
of the Light Horse section of the war, notes
this and points out instances where, when
the men were convinced that it was worth
while, they outshone all competitors in
ceremonial and “spit and polish” soldier-
ing.
The two most generally undisciplined
regiments I ever met were both units of
the old Imperial regular army, the Munster
Fusiliers and the Leinster Regiment, both
now disbanded, with both of which units
my own regiment was for some time associ-
ated in the South African War of a genera-
tion ago. The only two instances of in-
discipline among Dominion troops of which
I have ever had personal experience hap-
pened in that campaign. The first was
when the Canadian Infantry refused to
carry on after Pretoria was taken, and
demanded to be returned to Canada. The
other was the refusal of the 6th N.Z.
mounted regiment to march from Utrecht,
in the South-Eastern Transvaal, with
Plumer’s column, until they had received
their winter clothing. Both performances
were technically mutiny, but the authorities
had to grin and bear it. Beyond a little
drunken rioting in Capetown and Durban
by parties of men off duty and awaiting
return —affairs that were magnified out of
all semblance to the truth by the Afrikander
press—the Australian behaved as well in
those days as he was to do in the more
epic struggle. He received in the S’African
days far less training than he did in the
later day; so, taking him by and large,
there is justification in thinking that the
sense of duty which is an inheritance of
his British ancestry is as fast-fixed in him
as in most.
*
Monkeying with the Glands.
“E. M. Pyric”: One hesitates to criticise
the distinguished Vouonoff, especially when
one realises that he may very well be in-
accurately reported. Nevertheless, he seems
to be overdoing his theories.
The art of extracting and standardising
the active principles of ductless glands is
well advanced. Pituitary extract, for in-
stance, is invaluable. But the grafting of
live gland substance is inevitably a gamble.
The whole or any part of the graft may
“take.” It may merely die. It may be a
long or a short time before the new secre-
tions are adjusted to those of the recipient
of the graft. Meantime the patient may
suffer considerable disturbance of bodily
functions. There are no means by which
the strength of the piece of gland to be
grafted may be measured. Portions of the
same gland may be tested, but glands are
not uniform in structure, and it is hardly
feasible to hold up the operation whilst the
gland is being tested for potency. The
only control lies in excision of all or part
of the graft if the patient shows signs of
hypersecretion of the new tissue.
Vokonoff comes of a school that has
always been daring in medical research. The
Austro-German is not hampered by the
humanitarianism of the British student, and
frequently lacks the breadth of vision that
characterises the latter. His work is in-
valuable as an addition to our knowledge of
ductless glands and their functions, but
there are many risks to be considered and
eliminated before his operations can be
accepted as routine surgical procedures.
The sexual glands are especially to be
treated with respect. The physical and
mental development of the body can un-
doubtedly be greatly accelerated by gland
grafts in infancy or youth and a race of
supermen may result, but there would be a
price to pay.
The new race would be precocious in
proportion to the success of the grafts.
Adolescence would be at from six to ten
years, mating at 10 or 12, old age at 20,
and death at thirty—if Voronoff’s theories
were carried into complete practice. True,
there would be innumerable infant geniuses.
Literature and art would profit (?) by the
work of super-imaginations. Life would be
at thrice the present hectic speed. Nervous
breakdowns in every house, suicides by the,
score and crimes passioncles the chief fea-
tures of our newspapers!
Present-day youth is trying very hard to
prove that it can do without experience.
What will happen if youngsters, even super
youngsters, try to cram 10 years’ knowledge
and experience into two or three? One
hesitates to criticise the distinguished
Voronoff; but the ductless gland is physio-
logical dynamite.

The “Pictures” and the State.
There is a curious agitation, more curious
because it has been pushed mainly by
wealthy film interests, to induce the Com-
monwealth -Government to spend a large
sum (half a million has been suggested)
upon the construction of a big picture-
production studio with a view to encourage
the local industry. An attractive frill has
been put upon the suggestion in the shape
of a proposal that the studio might be
established at Canberra, and so give a
definite industry to a place which will have
to live otherwise as a sort of political pub.
The small men in the movie business,
the men who have been battling for years
against the strangulation of the industry,
have no faith in the suggestion; their de-
mand is for a little of the same protec-
tion that has enabled the German picture-
makers to establish themselves in a remark-
ably short time. The Germans insist that if
a country wants to secure a market for its
films in Germany, it must, in return, take
German films; the representatives of the
Australian industry merely ask modestly
for a quota system which will assure to
them a minor share of their own market.
The grandiose proposal for a large-sized
slice of socialism in a business which does
its talking in hundreds of thousands looks
—especially when it is advocated by wealthy
interests normally opposed to socialism —
like an attempt to side-track that legitimate
demand.
When the original Actors’ Union was
formed in 1912, no less than 80 per cent,
of the 180 or so members who joined up
derived their most regular work from picture
acting. They were there for stage jobs
when importation-crazed managers gave
them a chance; but the film was their
stand-by. That, however, was before the
foreign film interests formed Australian
amalgamations which practically forced the
picture shows into the position of tied
houses, compelled to obey the behests of
their virtual owners. When the Australian
actor and producer had their natural oppor-
tunity for supplying the local market, there
was no need for heavy State expenditure in
various forms of subsidy to keep the local
industry going; and the main cure for its
sick condition is in the restoration of its
right to supply, to at least some extent, the
market from which it has been squeezed
by the intrusive foreigner.

Fall in, Diggers!
“J.H.W.”: “War Wrecks Living on the Bread
Line”—so reads a heading in the daily news-
paper.
Nearly nine years ago the guns ceased
fire and home rolled the transports. Peace
and plenty was the promise for the future.
The promise has been unfulfilled because
the job was left half done.
Call it what you will, Communism, Red
Ragism, at bedrock its policy is the sub-
jugation of the majority by an organised
minority. And the minority is not Aus-
tralian.
Hopes ran high on the transport coming
home—hopes seemingly realised when on
receiving our discharges we were asked to
join the R.S.L. The League was to safe-
guard our interests, keep a fatherly eye on
us, let the politicians know who did win
the war. But we left the job half done.
The League should have been political. It
sho.uld have fathered the Soldiers’ Party.
With an active membership of round about
half a million, highly organised, with some
of the best brains in Australia to lead us,
we could and would have established a
government with “Australia First” as the
one and only plank in its platform. “Aus-
tralia first and last”—we’d won our “right
to live.”
Corrupt politicians, bribed aldermen, an
entire State held up for a few foreigners,
electorates juggled so that the governing
party holds power with an actual minority
—fall in the stable picquet and let’s clean
up! The League is non-political at, present.
It has done good work as far as its consti-
tution allows. Sound the “fall in” again
and enlist for the Soldiers’ Party. The
American War of Independence (and after)
proved that soldiers can be statesmen. Let
us take a leaf out of the American book.
What we can’t make, we won’t have. If
we can’t make motor-cars (I’ll eat a Lizzie
if we can’t), let’s walk till we can.
It’s not too late. Fall in, Diggers!
Fritz Dei* Legpuller?
The Bulletin has again and again warned
Australia that the admission of Germany to
membership of the League of Nations would
be swiftly followed by an outright demand
for the return of all or some of its forfeited
colonies, or, at least, to have the mandate
over them transferred to itself. The thing
has happened already, with a further an-
nouncement that “annihilating criticism”
will be aimed at the present mandatories.
Happily, Fritz does not take us by sur-
prise; his long campaign of calumny and
falsehood, carried out under a transparent
veil ever since the mandates were taken
over, was a loud and clumsy warning.
Australians may profess to find solace in
the statement that the return of the Pacific
mandates is not desired. What Germany
professes to desire is the return of its old
East African holdings; and no one will
doubt that desire for a moment—no one, at
any rate, who knows of Germany’s pre-war
preparations to build up a vast reserve of
cannon fodder among the warlike native
tribes. Much of East Africa is a white
man’s country, too, and as an outlet for
surplus people it has its additional value.
But whether the professed German indiffer-
ence to the Pacific mandates is genuine is at
least doubtful. Putting aside the very
valuable phosphate deposits of Ocean Island
and Nauru, the other mandates are an ever-
increasing source of cheap oil. From oil
glycerine is made, and glycerine is an essen-
tial factor in the manufacture of those
explosives on which the German once built
such high hopes.
To wholly believe our old antagonist in
this particular, with his past record in the
matter of promises and his publicly expressed
aspirations in mind, is to stretch even the
most elastic imagination to breaking point.
The Foreign Devil in China.
How low the barometer of European pres-
tige in Asia has fallen owing to European
disunity is illustrated by the difference in
the attitude of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment towards the disappearance of the Aus-
tralian Basil Riley in 1927 and the atti-
tude of the British Government towards
the murder of Augustus Raymond Mar-
gary in 1875. Margary, a British consular
official, was brutally butchered in one of the
remotest corners of the Celestial Empire.
The British Government promptly de-
manded an inquiry. The trial was a farce.
The real murderers had undoubtedly acted
under official direction. Eleven half-naked
savages were duly produced and charged,
and there was a mountain of manufactured
evidence. The British observers withdrew
from the comic opera and Britain threatened
sudden war. The mandarins caved in, a
convention was called at Chefoo and China
agreed to send a mission of apology to Eng-
land, pay an indemnity and guarantee the
right of all foreigners to travel anywhere
in China without molestation. Two
months ago Basil Riley left his residence
at Chengchow, a large city in a peaceful
province, to walk to the Y.M.C.A. quarters,
15 minutes distance. According to General
Feng, he “disappeared.” A white man can
no more “disappear” in China without the
officials knowing than a Chinaman can be
killed at midday in George-street without
police cognisance. The inference is that
he was murdered and that the Feng admini-
stration knows it. Yet neither Mr. Bruce
nor the British Government has even asked
for an explanation.
And the American and other foreign Gov-
ernments fatuously imagine that by curry-
ing favor with the murderers their own
nationals will be exempt from similar un-
kindness !

The Commonwealth’s Railways.
Dear Bulletin, —“Bildad” (B. 8/9/’27) is
concerned because the interest burden on the
East-West, line is less than it used to be;
while the North-South’s interest bill has not
shrunk.
The Commonwealth constructed its
Trans-Australian trunk line partly out of
revenue, which with subsequent loan re-
demption reduced its annual interest outlay
to a respectable figure, whereas South Aus-
tralia, which constructed the Port Augusta-
Oodnadatta narrow-gauge line some decades
before the close of the nineteenth century,
handed it over to the Commonwealth in
1926 with an annual interest bill undimin-
ished by any such helpful attentions.
Nevertheless, “Bilbao's” attempt to attri-
bute the Trans-Australian railway’s con-
sistently improved finances to the incidence
of the interest bill is as irrelevant as his
seemingly astute selection of the years 1920
and 1925 for purposes of comparison. The
following figures from Commonwealth Rail-
ways Commissioner Bell’s annual report
tell their own tale: —
Year Ended Passengers Balance After Paying
30th June, Carried. Working Expenses.
1921 .. 29,636 £91,339 Loss
1922 .. 28,003 48,607 „

1925 . . 32,362 37,516 „
1926 . . 34,512 6,569 „
The figures for 1927 have not yet been dis-
closed, but the Federal Minister for Rail-
ways has announced that a considerable
surplus may be anticipated.—Yours, Prickly
Jack.

The Holy band.
Occasional news from the Holy Land,
which gave up being holy some centuries
ago and is only now getting a fair chance to
resume, shows the white man at his usual
work of improvement on the discolored
man’s dilapidated estate. A recent item per
cable is that, under British management, the
business of harnessing the Jordan, which
has run or precipitated itself to industrial
waste since Creation, is proceeding apace.
When it is completed an almost unbeliev-
able amount of electric power, far in excess
of all the horse-power of all the factories
of the Commonwealth, will be made
available.
A great deal has been done for the miser-
able country during the few years since
the war. Roads, railways, bridges, tele-
graphs and telephones have been im-
proved and multiplied. Hundreds of Gov-
ernment schools, including technical schools
and some colleges, have sprung up. The
new forestry department planted three mil-
lion trees in its first two years. They are
expected to cast a grateful shade over a
legion which has been long devastated by
savages of various degrees, so that the
hills of Judasa came to look like miles of
bald skulls, suggestive of a cemetery of
giants buried with the heads sticking out.
The establishment of confidence, how-
ever, is a slow business. In the old
Turkish courts of Palestine it was reckoned
that 90 per cent, of the judgments were
sold, and that the other 10 per cent, were
not free from doubt. The new courts have
thus far a reputation for complete honesty.
An attempt is also in progress to establish
a Legislative Council in which the elective
element will predominate. But the Arab
elector, who forms the majority, is shy of
voting lest his name should be wanted for
military service or some other subtle, sur-
reptitious. subterranean purpose. The
marvel of air mails and motor services has
come to astonish the primitive inhabitant.
The national budget balances without
untidy soldiers coming round to demand
contributions at the point of a not over-
clean bayonet. New manufactures are aris-
ing, and a serious effort is being made
to explain that no man can become a
millionaire like Henry Ford if he ploughs
with a pre-Abrahamic implement and
grinds the corn with the implement men-
tioned in Exodus.
The mission of the British rulers in this
corner of Asia is, among other things, to
make it sanitary so that the inhabitant’s
years will be longer, and to put down
violence and cruelty so that they won’t be
cut so short, and to show him the road to
a modest prosperity and make life endur-
able so that years will be worth having,
and to teach him the white man’s lore so
that he will, in many cases, get the super-
ficial idea that he invented the lore himself.
One sure result will be an awkward prob-
lem of overcrowding, and a probable one
will be a strident demand from many sorts
and conditions of muddled or dl-intentioned
folk, at home and abroad, that the “oppres-
sor” shall clear out, and restore the colored
man to the blessings of “freedom.” And if
that comes about the colored man will
almost certainly proceed to sag back a
few centuries, so that he will require in
time to be rehabilitated all over again. The
people of Hejaz were presented with com-
plete independence and a long stretch of
railway. Thereupon another gang of Arabs
promptly, took away the independence, and
the railway stopped working automatically.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Last May N.S.W.’s Premier Slang re-
signed (self and Ministry), and the accom-
modating Excellency, instead of giving the
Opposition leader a chance, allowed Slang
to form a new Cabinet on conditions. One
was that the new Cabinet would go to the
country, which was superfluous, for he
couldn’t go anvwhere else; the other was
that Slang should rule without a Parlia-
ment for purely routine purposes only. As
the respite is being employed for all manner
of vote-buying acts which aren’t routine, it
seems time that his Ex. sent the Slang
minority Ministry about its business. He
could easily get another Cabinet to run the
elections. * The community had his Ex.’s
assurance that his minority Government
would pursue a certain course, and it would
hate to think that his Ex.’s assurance isn’t
worth anything.
Labor Premier McCormack has stifled tin-
hare bookmaking in the birth in Queensland
by simply saying it wouldn’t be allowed.
Labor Premier Hogan has taken the same
course in Victoria, with the same result. In
N. S. Wales, however, an alleged Labor Gov-
ernment has called tin-hare gambling hells
into existence to exploit the workers in de-
fiance of an express decision of Parliament.
Thrown on its defence, it asks the public to
believe that it took promoters of tin-hare
cos. under its wing, and gave them valuable
considerations gratis, to prevent hundreds of
these niglit-gambling hells springing up.
What a whining humbug of a Government it
is!
Victoria’s Hogan Government hopes to
balance the budget by putting on some extra
taxes and introducing the totalisator, at
which the uneasy local conscience has
hitherto shied. But unless the Federal Gov-
ernment can find a way of squaring the
balance of trade, local paper budgets may
come out right and yet affairs be very much
wrong. Since Premier Lawson started his
career of unlimited foolishness in 1918 Vic-
toria has added £64,000,000 to its debt,
almost exactly half of this being spent in
buying moderate-sized properties at immoder-
ate prices, adding to these the cost of an
immensity of pompous management, and then
cutting the land up into farms a great deal
too small. The area under cultivation in
1926 was less than in 1916. 1923, 1924
or 1925, but the liability remains.
The third Irish Free State general elec-
tion was as indecisive as the others, if not
more so. Cosgrave's party and De Valera’s
made slight gains at the expense of Labor,
the Farmers and Redmond’s National
Leaguers, but neither can give their dis-
tracted country stable government. Though
the Cosgraves remain in office they will be
at the mercy of small groups and freelances.
In fact, proportional representation had
the same results in Ireland as in N. S. Wales.
It is a beautiful theory, but it won’t work.
The election of President Cosgrave for
two seats in the Free State has a Vic-
torian precedent; and the party was an
Irishman, too. He was John O’Shanassy,
who, at the first election for the Leg.
Assembly 71 years ago, was returned for
both Melbourne and Ivilmore. O’Shanassy
was afterwards Premier three times.
The Sydney Labor alderman who jumped
into fame by declaring, in connection
with some municipal tenders for motor-cars,
that he had a right to look after the interests
of a friend, was beaten in the selection bal-
lot for his ward. He is appealing because
of the inevitable “irregularities,” among
which lie cites an opponent’s use of motor-
cars to convey voters to the poll. It is an
illogical objection, seeing that the voters in
question were merely looking after the
interests of a friend.
BROTHERS IN HARMONY.
“Bookmakers and religious bodies are providing strenuous opposition to the Vic. Totalisator Bill.”
We normally ’ate one another,
But now, wiv a catch in the throat,
We sing ’ere like brother an’ brother,
And pray to be saved from the tote!
CHORUS: Ri-tooro!—ri-toral, etc.
To avoid adding a deficit of £503,000 to
the £1,594,000 of previous lean —or reck-
less —years, Vic. Premier Hogan proposes to
raise £201,000 by additional income-tax.
£60,000 by doubling the stamp-duty on
cheques (making it 2d.) and £49,000 by
increasing Titles Office and legal fees. In
addition, £lOO,OOO is to be transferred from
the Mallee laud fund to general revenue on
the assumption that the Federal-States finan-
cial (sinking funds) agreement will be rati-
fied ; if it isn’t ratified the State will have
to provide for another £690.000. The income-
tax increases are Id. in the £ on personal
exertion, 2d. on property and the same on
companies other than life-assurance concerns.
Apparently Hogan acted on the advice of his
Treasury officers, except in regard to one
item. The tote was dragged in at the last
moment. lie is to legislate for it (if he
can) this year and operate it (if possible)
next year.
Proceedings before the Commission which
is to ponder upon the Federal Constitution
commenced with an address. by barrister
Nicholas, who was employed to point out the
defects in the document. They were so
many that the long day closed when he was
still skirmishing on the fringe of his sub-
ject. Defects in a Constitution are common
enough; even G- Washington and Co. put
in so many that 11 amendments were made
in the first 11 years of union. Unfortu-
nately the Australian elector, so much of
him as straggles to the poll, generally turns
any proposal down, which saves the trouble
of studying it.
The last “Quarterly Summary,” which
shows that there were 250 disputes involv-
ing 90,040 workpeople in Lang’s State last
year, as against 104 disputes involving
10,394 workpeople in the rest of Australia,
makes other comparisons equally unflattering
to the Slangwhangs. It gives the average
cost of living (food, groceries and housing)
in 30 towns, being five for each State, dur-
ing the year to June, 1927, and sets down
Sydney as the most costly of them all. It
also credits N.S.W. with being above the
average for unemployment, just to round
things off.
Evidently Hogan does not intend to
appoint an Agent-General for Vic. this finan-
cial year, if he can avoid it. He has made
no provision for the customary allowance on
the Estimates.
N.S.W.’s Slang Government is naked but
quite unashamed. The other day the elec-
toral returning-officer at Oberon was in-
formed that he was sacked for being a poli-
tical partisan. Every man who possesses
intelligence and isn’t for sale is a political
partisan, but in this case it meant, of course,
that he was supposed to be a Nationalist.
The discharged official had held his job for
20 years, so he counted the votes which
helped to put in the Labor Governments of
McGowen, Holman, Storey-Dooley and Lang.
The Governor gave Slang and his minority a
fresh lease of power without any obligation
to meet Parliament on the promise that it
would stick to purely routine matters. His
Ex. may think he gave the people a fair
deal, but opinions differ.
A Burns-Philp skipper who recently called
in at Darwin reported that the wharf-
lumpers there are the slowest in the world,
and that the recent visit of Arbitration
Judge Beeby had apparently left things
where they were. Where else did anyone
expect them to be left?
Bundaberg, another sugar town in the
stormy North, has provided a parallel to the
South Johnstone strike incident in which a
cake was declared “black.” Bundaberg’s row-
ing club allowed a band of its own members to
supply the music at its dance. Thereupon the
State president of the A.W.U., who is also a
rowing-club man, was hauled before the Board
of Arbitration by the Musicians’ Union to
show cause why lie should not be cast alive
to wild saxophonists. The board declined to
interfere, so “solidarity” got another set-
back.
While the Queensland railway stoppage
was on some impassioned advice came from
Moscow, where Lang’s friends are such wel-
come guests, urging the employees to hold
out till they secured control of the system,
lock, stock and barrel. It recalls happenings
of the early Bolsh days in Russia. Lenin’s,
message to the factory-’ands was: “The fac-
tories are yours. Enter and take posses-
sion.” They did—and production fell to
about one-twelfth of the old average. The
exclusive oligarchy of communists presently
developed, and this close corporation, about
a million strong, took hold of the situation
with a firm hand and a hobnailed foot. It
might be even less skilled than the mass
below it, but the policy of industrial con-
scription helped to increase the output. Who-
ever owns the factories in Russia the men
who toil in them know to a certainty that
they don’t, and they can’t remember clearly
that they ever did. That dream has van-
ished into the Land of Blither.
Melbourne Trades Hall Council, after con-
siderable mental toil, passed four resolutions,
the first a single sentence of 128 words,
against assisted immigration, as it would
create “over-competition _ for the limited
amount of work available” and “imperil the
Australian worker’s Standard of living.”
Last financial year Australia imported
£184,744,927 worth of goods, which was not
only a record but was far short of the ex-
ports which were supposed to pay for them,
and it borrowed some 40 or 50 millions
from the hated foreign capitalists to cover
the difference and keep up the standard of
living—which will have a long way to fall
when the bubble bursts. Naturally the
amount of work, available was more or less
limited. It is impossible to buy such an
immensity of wares, made by all the human
sundries of the globe, and yet have the job
of making these wares.
One dread which haunts the four Vic.
Country Progs, now supporting Labor is
that their constituents may get the notion
that they might just as well have the real
thing. The recent Prog, conference revealed
a hopeless division on the Tariff issue; some
zealots were even for abandoning (he heavy
protective duties on dried fruits. That won t
help the party in the irrigation settle-
m cuts.
Maori land has a tariff revision every two
or three years. The latest has been framed
by a Farmers’ party to help the farming
interest, but there is only one item that
has really annoyed manufacturers. There
used to be a duty of 10 p.c. British prefer-
ential and 15 p.c. general on motor bodies
valued at £2OO or under, with a preferential
duty of 5 P.c. and a general duty of 7-i p.c.
on value in excess of £2OO. Now there s a
flat rate of 10 p.c. on the first £2OO and o
p.c. on value in excess of £2OO. The idea is
to encourage the assembly of imported
chassis and bodies within the Dominion-
General Motors, Ford and others have
erected assembling-works, and the Coatesites
like the notion. But the motor-body builders
are talking about shutting up shop.
A trade shindy between France and the
United States is foreshadowed. The I rencl:
noticed that they bought considerable mei
cliandise from the step-sister republic, bu
that the Yanks took very little in return.
Australia meets a similar difficulty by givin-
Uncle an lOU for five or ten or fifteen mil
lions, and leaving posterity to pay. Not fee-
ing inclined for that kind of finance, especial!.'
as they owe Uncle too much already, th ■
French tried increased duties on some lines
of goods which, they thought, would meet the
case. Thereupon they learned from across
the Atlantic that the U.S. President is the
kind of potentate who can wave a wand ana
completely forbid the entrance of any coun-
try’s goods right there.

No quick-wit answer now can please
Your carping querist. On your knees!
’Tis voting Eve to-day decrees
Your hapless fates, men!
About your fiscal faith she cares no jot,
But looks, mere looks, will sway her quite
a lot.
Convictions it may be you hold,
Or Red or Tory.
You come to spend the hoarded gold
Of witching diction, to unfold
A programme masterly and bold.
’Tis d priori
A futile scheme, you ought to be aware,
She’s more concerned about your eyes and
hair.
What splendid ardors in you burn,
What hopes you cherish
Of fame to win or foes to spurn
May be fulfilled, if maids discern
A chance that you may serve their turn,
But else you perish.
And this may turn the scale when naught
else will,
The little fact that you are single still.
But I (O politicians all!)
Who grow aweary
Of brainless roar and witless brawl,
Who can no good in you recall.
Who may not e’en for beauty fall —
Not mine to query
Attractions which may sway the other sex.
Your salient features are for me—your

Yea, where they secured a flat-bottomed boat

“Ilasen": I take exception to “Sol Mala-

millions. Not that the millions worry me—
there were only 113 of them, anyhow, and
the chances against some Australian collect-
ing something seem to be about the same
figure (including the 000,000) to one. What
I object to is “S.M.’s” unscholarly references
to actual historical characters. He states
that he, Solomon, arrived in this country
with Captain Cook, and that the first white
man they met was William Morris Hughes
—“waving a red flag with one hand and
sticking up an election placard with the
other.” Now, at that time red-flaggery,
such of it as was not in chains, must have
been having the thinnest of times in a
land ruled by Imperialists. Which means
that W. Morris Hughes was on the losing
side. Such careless inaccuracies in other-
wise convincing narratives are annoying.

strike three, dogs dashed upon it. When Dad

one arm (the other being too damaged to
be of much use to him), was a lieutenant
in the 51st while his father, formerly an
officer of the Royal Fusiliers, wore a ser-
geant's stripes in the same battalion. Inci-

side of the ledger is the case of a well-to-do

For several years they submitted to the
failure of the stork to patronise their home;
then they adopted an infant. But that did
not satisfy the mother’s maternal longings;
when it had growm out of babyhood she

“Uncle Flam”: Nothing like looking up
the press of other countries to get the

Three of these dangerous beasts got away
from a menagerie, but the female, which
“was mothering” the other two, was shot,
her offspring escaping into the wilds. To
calm the terrified populace, the local chief
of police despatched the expedition, which
returned without scalps, though it saw
tracks. Another party is to go in pursuit,
but, according to the Tribune, several con-
siderations must be taken into account,
notably the appalling ferocity of the brutes.

“Macropus giganteus (the scientific name for

card, card, card?” At other times, when
there was nothing to cry, he was a bill-poster
by day and a billiard-marker by night. A
crier I knew in the north-western corner was
more various. The town couldn't afford a
multiplicity of officials; it specialised in
officials who had a multiplicity of callings.
Consequently the herdsman was town-crier
when necessary; he was also a concertina
and violin teacher; he played at dances, and
when nothing else was doing he worked an
alluvial claim on the flat. But whatever he
was engaged at he was always available in
his semi-official capacity. To find him you
asked the blacksmith.

“Cgesar’s Ghost”: Some diners at a Sydney
restaurant got a shock when they found that
the man sitting at the table with them was
dead. They noticed that he was leaning for-
ward and looked ill, but they had con-
tinued their eating for some time before they
learnt that a cadaver had shared their feast.
An old actor I knew had a worse experi-
ence. He had agreed to share a double bed
with a stranger in a crowded hotel. On his
way back from the bathroom, clad in his
pyjamas and without matches, he mistook
his room, w r andering into one in which a dead
body had been laid out on the bed. It
was a hot night, too, and he was too sozzled
to notice that his bedmate made no response
to the suggestion that he should move over
a bit; but when Roscius woke up in the
clear light of day and discovered that he
had spent the night under the same sheet as
a corpse liis yell woke the hotel.

“Matakitaki”: You heard this one; but
that time it wasn't quite the same. Henare
had been under a ticklish operation, and the
surgeon lit a cigar while waiting to see that
the patient was all right. Henare w T as coming-
out of the chloroform. Taking a deep breath,
he smelt the aroma of the cigar. He opened
his eyes and looked about him. He caught
sight of the flames of the steriliser; of two
or three strange figures in overalls and of the
cloud of cigar-smoke. That last was the dead
finish. “Py corry,” he said; “te operation
fail!”
PRE-EMPTIVE PRAWNS.
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
“There was a proposal that fish-barrows should be
kept of! the Sydney streets. The merits of mullet,
flathead, garfish, bream and whiting were discussed.
Then prawns were reached. Aldermen .... expressed
their friendship for the prawn men. These honest
fellows need not go, they said.”—Aituus.
Y T e prawns of old that aldermanic fingers
Have dallied with, ere yet to office won!
What mem’ry of your succulence still lingers,
Your daintiness not even yet outdone
By other and more consequential dishes,
’Fore which full many a stout old Bumble
yawns!
Ye rollicking poor-relatives of fishes!
Ye pink and precious but plebeian prawns!
Oh, can it be that he, a city father,
Who then was of the village quite a lad,
Once parted at his lips the beery lather
The better to admit your carcass glad?
And though to-day at seemly civic dinner
Or garden-party on vice-regal lawns,
He may not own you, yet be sure some
inner
Man still regrets you, O departed prawns!
For lo! whereas he frowns on other barrows
And will not have them in the public ways,
No veto stern your welcome vendor harrows,
No by-law blocks your vivid, pert displays;
And who shall say what fair, full nights he
dreams on
(Pre-aldermanic nights and heady dawns),
And who shall read his thoughts, as now he
beams on
Your whiskered faces, O historic prawns!
Ye prawns of old! Tradition o’er you
hovers,
Protective tenderness to wake in him
Who little pity in liis heart discovers
For mullet grey or gar or silver bream.
THOSE TRAM STEPS AGAIN!
DOCTOR: “You must avoid all forms of excitement!”
PATHENT: “But hang it all, doctor, can’t I even look at ’em in the street?”
What turns him thus to mercy in his
measures?
No bribe is here, no Baal on whom he
fawns....
What foaming thoughts of unforgotten
pleasures
Have won your triumph, O befriended
prawns?
VICTORIA.
HASEN.


“FY7”: A Federal arbitration award lias
abolished a cherished bush institution—the
right of the shearer to select his cook. In the
old days, when the shearers also paid the
“slushy,” no one ever questioned the right;
there was general acceptance of the principle
that he who pays the piper calls the tune.
But cooks are on award wages now, and the
Court reckons it a fair thing that the boss
should make the appointment, though the
shearers argue that, as they pay a weekly
sum as backsheesh to their chej, the right
of choice should remain with them. One
would have thought the employers better
satisfied with the old method. Under that,
it was the shearer who suffered if the cook
was incompetent, or given to strong waters,
or incurably bad-tempered, even if he didn’t
spoil food. It was no unusual thing for
such a one, after a cr ticism of his menu,
to “roll up” and take the road, leaving the
hungry chaps in the shed to shift for
themselves. Now all that Worry and risk
will fall on the pastoralist, with no compen-
sating advantage, as far as I can see. The
shearer, on the other hand, is relieved of
responsibility, and, since he has the option
of objecting to the cook after two days’ trial,
seems no more likely to be let in for burned
meals than he was under the ancient regime.
“Flip” : The importance of air transit in
this country was illustrated when Australian
Air Services, in Melbourne, received a sum-
mons from Grenfell (N.S.W.) for an ambu-
lance ’plane. A ’bus left the aerodrome in
the afternoon, and was back, with the
patient, a doctor and a nurse, at 11 next
morning. A waiting motor-ambulance
whisked the patient off to a hospital, where
the operation was performed.

“Trampas” : Perhaps the Chinee’s opinion
is that the heathen Caucasian is peculiar.
There is an aged specimen in North Queens-
land who has been gaoled for not having
sold opium to an abo. He and a younger
(and less wily) Chink were charged with
having sold some of the soothing brown stuff
to the dark gentleman. China, junior,
pleaded guilty and was awarded six months.
The other insisted that he was innocent. To
prove the case against him it was necessary
that the exhibit recovered from the abo.
should be sent to Brisbane for analysis. It
was six weeks before the report drifted back,
and thereupon China, junior, was very has-
tily freed from durance vile. The old ’un
took his place as a guest of Royalty for
having "falsely pretended that a composition
of brown sugar and water was opium fit for
smoking. ’ Possibly there's room for doubt
about the strict legality of the conviction, but
they're not given to hair-splitting at Croydon.

“Uramao”: A poet named Geoffrey
Wladislas Vaile Potocki de Montalk, who
was_ defendant in a Christchurch suit for
restitution of conjugal rights, has no flat-
tering opinion of Maoriland as a field for
the divine afflatus. Disgusted at the meagre
returns his effusions brought him, Geoffrey
became in turn a clerk and a milkman. One
of his letters read in Court said: “Poets are
as badly treated in this land of white sav-
ages and All Blacks as they are feted,
laurelled and crowned in Merrie England.”
He wound up by mentioning that he was
leaving Christchurch, “the holy city,” to go
to Samarkand.

“Retired Volt” : There is one direction in
which the new wireless pedagogy can be
useful, and that is in the teaching of lan-
guages, especially the English variety.
Some of our slovenliest speakers are to be
found amongst schoolteachers, and some of
the most elegant diction is to be heard from
radio announcers. Most of these announcers
are ex-actors with the mummer’s trained
respect for right expression and clear
speech. It is a positive delight, for instance,
to hear Maurice Dudley, of 3LO, declaim the
market reports as if he were Polonius once
more advising Laertes on how to behave in
THE PURSE TRICK.
LANG: “Come on, gents., come on! Here I drop higher wages, and better con-
ditions, and good seasons, and pay when you’re out of a job—all these I
drop, drop into this little purse. Now, who’ll give me a vote for it?”
Paris. The Australian schoolmaster teach-
ing foreign languages is often as bad a joke
as Japanese pedagogues teaching English.
World broadcasting is advancing so rapidly
that it will soon be possible to tune-in to
stations speaking all the languages supposed
to be taught in Australian schools. The
first persons to avail themselves of the
opportunity should be the teachers.
“P.M.” : Electrocution is not the only fate
which a swift punch can avert (B. 8/9/’27).
A South Gippsland cocky and his newchum
assistant were getting through a fence when
the boss yelled, “Jump, quick !” As Choom
was slow in obeying he gave him one under
the ear that knocked him spinning. The
smitten youth pulled himself together and
was about to return the compliment when
the sight of the boss laying out a four-foot
tiger-snake quietened him down.
* * * *
“The Listening Insect”: The parent has
practically been eliminated from the nur-
sery by the mellifluous gent, who sits at the
broadcasting station and tells the same bed-
time story to a million children. The next
person to go will be the schoolteacher. In
the Fold Land the National Association of
Schoolmasters has just signed approval of
loud-speakers in the classroom, and is arrang-
ing for a wireless teacher who will supple-
ment —-and ultimately supplant—the bad-
gered pedadogue with the cane. The associa-
tion doesn’t think all subjects are suit-
able for wireless dissemination, but the cur-
riculum it favors is pretty extensive. It
includes several sorts of music, moral and
religious instruction, elocution, science,
geography, drama and history, and it looks
as if the teacher will eventually become a
sort of monitor whose chief duties will be
tuning-in and seeing that science is main-
tained. Vic. Education Department recently
scowled on a proposal of 3LO to introduce
the system here. I am inclined to be in
agreement with that scowl. This life is
becoming too ghostly altogether.
* * * *
“Lao-dah” : There is still exploring to be
done, even in Victoria. Two youngsters,
E. J. Maloney and I. McManus, have just
finished an eight-day trudge on skis from
Omeo to Bright and back over the Aus-
tralian Alps. They found the snow over the
telegraph posts, and entered the patrolman's
hut at llotham Heights through the roof. It
was the first time the return trip had been
made in winter, and the obliteration of most
of the landmarks made the journey as much
a new trail as the. route of Burke and Wills.

“The Rumpus”: A Perth business man
saw a bagman friend leaving the central
station after a country journey. Subsequent
to drinks, he invited the traveller to his home
for lunch, but the latter protested that he
wanted a brush-up and a change. "Chuck
your cases in the car,” was the other's com-
mand ; “you can get all that in my house.”
When the pair reached the premises the
business man found his wife was enjoying a
gossip next door, so he showed his friend to
the bathroom and then went to the kitchen
to issue a few instructions to cook. His
wife, catching sight of the car, hastened
home and, hearing sounds in the bathroom,
pushed the half-open door and tiptoed in.
She entered at the precise moment when the
inmate was pulling his shirt over his head.
Came a masculine grunt, and a strange head
popped up over the tail of the garment. The
lady gave a smothered gasp and fled, locking
herself in the bedroom. Everything was ex-
plained by her husband through the keyhole,
but she stayed in her room till the owner of
the shirt had gone about his business.

“Der Jong”: It isn’t often one bears of a
Jew dog-dealer (B. l/9/’27), but I can recall
one who blossomed into the business in Cape-
town during the Boer War. He was a
Whitechapel Hebrew who had been unable
to get up to Jo’burg while the w T ar was on and
found it hard to keep going. Loafing out-
side a pub, he saw two prosperous-looking
coves come out. Said one: “I wish I knew
where to lay hands on a good Pom.; my wife
is pestering the life out of me to buy her
one.” Ike was at his elbow in a moment.
“I can sell you a lofely Pom.,” he said
ingratiatingly. The other considered. “All
right.” he replied, “have it here to-morrow
at midday, with all the particulars. But,
mind. I won’t give a penny over a tenner
for it.” Agreeing gratefully. Ikey with-
drew, and ran all the way to the little fish
shop off Adderley-street kept by his friend
Israel Schnoekenfritz. “Vat’s der madder?”
asked Israel, as Ikey burst into the shop.
“A den pound note's der madder,” said
Ikey, when he got his breath. “Israel, dell
me, vot in der hell's a Pom.?”
“Strand” (Loud.) : Now that Britain has
broken off relations with Red Russia Mos-
cow has been relieved of at least one pro-
blem —how to provide for London a represen-
tative who could be democratic without giving
offence. One of its earlier envoys thought
he could assert his Government's indepen-
dence by telling his wife not to curtsey to the
Queen. Much to his surprise, the British
Labor leaders took great pains to apologise
for the rudeness, attributing it to the lady’s
extreme confusion in the presence of royalty.
Her lord was recalled. In Paris the Soviets
tried another plan. First they sent along
Ivrassine, a polished dandy who had been a
rich merchant. When his wife took to
losing valuable pearl necklaces —for all the
world as if she had been a revue actress —
and Ivrassine blossomed out as a millionaire,
the thing became a joke on the boulevards.
Krassine’s successor, Rakovsky, also a dandy,
has done better, but with a good deal of
d.fficulty. He began by staffing the embassy
with French communists whose table manners
were a trial. Then he had trouble with
friendly politicians who would not dress for
dinner, and had to be accommodated with
some of Rakovskv's own dress-suits. In the
end the worried Marxian fitted up a dressing-
room in the entrance-hall, where dress-suits
are kept hanging up for the use of unwashed
guests who are keen on the economic inter-
pretation of history. The dress-suit habit,
by the bye, dies slowly in London. Barely a
week ago a member of Parliament (and a
colonel at that) who had invited an Ameri-
can actress to dinner had to entertain her at
a Lyons Popular because the West End
restaurants refused to admit anyone not in
evening-dress.
« * * *
“Ivooragai”: According to ancient mari-
ners, we owe the euphonious aboriginal
names of the Sydney ferry-boats to a Scotch-
man, who was chairman at the first christen-
ing. The vessel was to have been called
Willoughby. The chairman, in a rich Scotch
brogue, whispered “Wullaby” to the lady
who had the honor of bestowing the name,
and she christened it Wallaby. When the
next boat was built, being bigger than the
Wallaby, and of the same genus, it was
called Kangaroo. Thus originated the cus-
tom of giving abo. names, each beginning
with Iv, as Kookaburra, Kameruka. Ivian-
dra, Koompartoo, Kareela, Karama, Ivai Kai,
Kummulla, Ivaringal, Kara Kara, Ivalang,
Ivillara, Ivarabella, Ivurraba, Ivirribilli and a
dozen others.
* * * *
“Lao-dali” : Fate plays queer tricks some-
times. A motor-driver in Melbourne backed
a truck over a quarry. The truck hit the
cliff face three times before disappearing
into a waterhole, but the third bounce
smashed the cabin in which the driver was
imprisoned and he fell 150 feet. All the
damage he sustained was a slight scratch on
the nose. On the same day a workman fell
four feet in Flinders-lane and broke his leg.
“Hamba Gachle”: There is un-
conscious humor in the cabled
report of an address delivered to
a South African audience by L. C.
Amery, British Secretary of State
for the Dominions. The chronicler
dwells on Amery’s wonderful tact
in opening his speech to the students
of .Stellenbosch University—a hot-
bed of Hertzogism—in Afrikaans,
“which he learned 30 years ago.
whpn a war correspondent, in order
to interview President Kruger.”
What the tourist was doing as a
war correspondent in the Trans-
vaal in 1897, two years before the
second Boer War began, is not
clear. Neither is the method he
adopted of learning Afrikaans,
which had not then been invented,
and which Oom Paul could not
have understood if it had been. The
language of the Boer in those days
was that genderless, caseless hotch-
potch of Dutch, Portuguese, old
French. English and Kaffir, plus a
few other oddments, which was
known as the Taal. It was such a
fearful mixture that when the
Dutch Nationalists got the upper
hand in the Union Government,
and resolved to make it compulsory
for all Government services—before
that English and the Taal had
equal rights—they had to • set to
work to knock it into shape and
frame some written rules for it.
The result was Afrikaans, which is
almost as artificial a lingo as Esperanto.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: “The Listening Insect”
is surely behind the times in his remarks on
the disturbing effect of the aurora aus-
tralis on telegraphy (B. 22/9/’27). In the
present day of high-speed automatic working,
any disturbances that miglit be caused are
counteracted by the insertion of condensers,
and, with the newest type of relays in the
circuit, it takes a very exceptional aurora
to cause any trouble at all. Certainly it
never seriously affects the passing of traffic.
As for “the operators as far north as Singa-
pore cursing the day they were born.” the
keypusliers up that way are mostly Chinese
and Madras-men, who, when afforded a brief
respite from their dot-pushing by any dis-
turbance, offer up thanks to their particular
deity for the favor, and prayers that it may
continue.
THE GARDEN OF REFUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down in Poppin High-street I roomed
behind a shop,
And lived embowered in margarine and dill
and lollipop:
And every window was an eye and every eye
a mop.
Down mid Poppin High-street, its farthings
and its fleas,
Dwells Argus of the hundred eyes, as snoopy
as you please;
And Argus used to come to us for jam and
fags and cheese.
Down in Poppin High-street Rumor reigns
supreme:
Arms a-kimbo, tongue a-wag, she flaunts it
like a queen ;
Her wordy skirmish waxes warm with epi-
thets obscene.
Down in Poppin High-street the time is
always Now ;
And now’s the time the neighbors meet to
tell each other how—
Why so-and-so’s a dirty slut and who’s a
flaming cow.
I hated Poppin High-street, its garbage and
its din.
Its brutal brawls and badinage, its swinish
naked sin ;
But getting out of it was harder far than
getting in.
Down in Poppin High-street I caught a
sudden chill
And almost died. Ah, then it was I
stuml h] with a thrill
Of shame upon the hearts that God saw fit
to clothe so ill!
For Mrs. Hoolahan who, when her old man
was in clink,
Was wont to bring young fellows home who’d
treated her to drink,
And Mrs. Noakes who tippled gin “like
swilling down a sink,”
And many more foregathered in my smelly
little “back,”
Or slunk in one by one to say “How-do?”
and have a crack,
Or bring me in a “drop o’ good,” or heat
me up a snack.
And, lying there all helpless in my dirty
stretcher-bed,
And staring at the damp and dirty ceiling
overhead,
It seemed to me that flaked and mouldy
plaster up and said:
“The habits we get into they’re our over-
alls, no more ;
The human skin’s the undershirt alike of
rich and poor,
And you can’t have spotless linen where it’s
flung upon the floor.”
The preachers tell of Heaven where the
seems mighty thin
doors are closed to sin :
For Poppin-street, to say the least, the chance
Of ever starting on the road, much less of
getting in.
God once prepared a Garden and saw that it
was good
Before He gave it over to the human brother-
hood :
But nowadays it’s pretty hard to find out
where it stood.
And, now that man has weeded it and
watered it with tears,
And trimmed the primal tangle with mattock,
hoe and shears.
And digged and ditched and hedged it, these
many thousand years,
God walks yet in His Garden, and every
little while,
Though man lias built him temples to cage
his gods in style,
Is pleased to sit and brood a space upon
a garbage pile.

RIME OF THE BALIBUNTAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Although Baku straws are becoming popular, yet
the Balibuntal is with us still.” —Fashion note.
The Balibuntal is with us still,
And so are rent and the income-tax;
Father is looking perturbed and ill.
And his hair-trigger temper's beginnihg to
wax.
For father’s earliest touch of spring
Is “Cheque will oblige” on a milliner’s bill.
Though the mode is partial to Baku straws,
The Balibuntal is with us still.
FevTishlv fashioned by expert paws
The orders for chic little chapeaux to fill.
But father, knowing his budget’s flaws,
Consigns Balibuntals and Bakus to H !

“P.M.” : The yarn about the Chinese who
was so sensitive to an electric shock (B.
15/9/’27) reminds me of the Chow laborers
in France. Some of them used to hang about
our Flying Corps camp and pinch what they
•could in the way of tucker. At length our
squadron-electrician rigged up a trap out-
side the cookhouse ; it consisted of a leg of
mutton, an aeroplane starting-magneto and a
few accessories. When a Chow got hold of
the mutton the babbling brook turned the
handle of the starting-mag. I can’t say
whether those Chinks were extra sensitive,
but they certainly danced and yelled to the
satisfaction of all who saw them. And the
moral lesson was not wasted on their chatter-
ing tribe.

“H.K.” : A covering note forwarded with
a remittance to the N.S.W. Taxation Depart-
ment raised a smile among the clerks. It
was penned by a Riverina pastoralist, who
began civilly enough: “Please find enclosed
my cheque for £ .” Then the writer’s
feelings obviously got the better of him, for
he added—“and now you and your damned
olncers had better come up and take tlie little
that’s left.”
* * * *
“Flagwagger”: When a gang of navvies
opened up the recently-repaired road oppo-
site my house I made
one of the watching
throng—there is al-
ways a watching
throng on these occa-
sions. For some reason
two of the pick-and-
shovel artists com-
menced a quarrel. Or,
rather, one of them
did. For while a'
stream of' vituperation
poured from his mouth
the object of l.is wrath
remained silent. Even
the inevitable reference
to “blankards like
you” only brought a
grin. But inspiration
came to the wrathful
one. “You pence-card
unionist!” lie yelled.
The fight which fol-
lowed was the best I’ve
seen ; and I saw more
than a dozen epic
battles one afternoon
at Mildura. The com-
batants p unche d,
elbowed, bit and kicked
until the man who had
been called a pence-
card unionist avenged
himself. His traducer lay flat out in the
excavation.
“Athol”: The early-morning visitor to a
zoo gets the thrills. Then not only are
most of the beasts and birds at their best,
but odd jobs are done in the cages.
And there are more odd jobs than you’d
think —especially in the way of surgical
operations and shifting beasts from one cage
to another. One morning last week Peter,
a lion, had to be caught and submitted to
examination: either he had developed paraly-
sis of the hind quarters or broken a hind
leg. He was in the pit at the time, and it
was necessary to come right out into the
open to reach him. His sickness hadn’t
improved his temper either. Four attend-
ants brought in a narrow travelling-cage
with a rope running through a hole in the
back of it, and a noose on the outward end
of this rope. The chief attendant manoeuvred
ANOTHER OLD-FASHIONED PERSON.
“Her husband objects to her 'politics, I believe?”
“Yes, he insists that she drops the three-party system.”
for a position and lassoed Peter round the
neck ; another stood by in case Peter wanted
holding from the opposite direction; then
when the rope held taut the cage was run
up and Peter w T as drawn in. The actual
drawing in took some doing, but by that time
Peter, though he tore at the rope and roared
ANOTHER CASE OF STAGE FRIGHT.
BEST MAN (to bridegroom): “What’s wrong, Bill—lost the ring?”
BILL (dejectedly) : “No, wors’n that! Lost all me enthusiasm.”
at his assailants, had very little “play” left.
Once in the narrow cage chloroform would
sheathe all Peter’s claws and render his
fangs harmless; and examination would
follow.

“Medicus”: Of 384 malignant-disease cases
recorded in the annual report of Prince
Alfred Hospital, Sydney, 155 were due to
rodent ulcer and 77 to epitheliomata, which
is allied to rodent ulcer. Both these types
of cancer can be permanently removed if
caught in a sufficiently early state, but there
is an unfortunate tendency to delay seeing
a doctor until what was thought to be
just a scaly scab or sore has gone too far.
So common has the rodent ulcer become in
Australia that definite instruction and advice
as regards the appearance of the ulcer, etc.,
should be distributed as widely as possible.
By this means a great decrease in our most
frequent form of cancer might be effected,
while in other cases virulence or rapidity
of growth would certainly be diminished.

“Kayeff”: Concerning very old wine (B.
15/7/’27). One summer morning an artil-
lery officer and I, on liaison work, hopped
over with the Yanks. After a confused
though intrepid attack, the objective, a
wrecked village, was reached, and we were
poking about the streets when a sudden
heavy burst of shelling drove us to cover
in the nearest cellar. Rummaging round,
we discovered a cobweb-covered bottle of
“vang rooge.” Thirsty and tired, we could
hardly believe our good fortune. The neck
was knocked off, and with the usual “Here's
luck!” we each tossed down a decent gulp.
We didn’t take a second one, though, for
what had been good wine was by that time
excellent vinegar.

“C.Q.” : The ten tourists who started out
so casually from Melbourne G.P.O. in a
motor-coach to “do” Australia returned the
other day in the same quiet fashion. They
covered 5,206 miles in. seven weeks and
three days, going by way of Adelaide and
Alice Springs and returning through North-
ern Q. and N. S. Wales. But transcontinen-
tal travel is becoming a matter of routine,
nowadays, like catching a tram into the city.
A motorist of over 60 blew into Melbourne
from Perth recently. He made the trip with-
out even opening his toolbox and thought so
little of it that he came and went without
troubling to inform the papers.

“Te Anau”: The cabled account of the
martyrdom of Dr. Sidney Wilson, of Man-
chester, while experimenting on himself to
perfect a partial anaesthetic, recalls that
many medical men and women have laid
down their lives for the curative cause.
X-ray research has claimed most of them,
and self-experiments in that direction have
sometimes been aggravated by extra risks
such as Abbe Tauleigne took when he swal-
lowed lead in order to photograph its pro-
gress through his body. Australia can
claim a noble X-ray martyr in Dr. Hancock,
of Perth, who was the subject of a memorable
debate in the State Parliament. One of
our devoted leprosy research men contracted
the disease he was studying and isolated him-
self for observation until he could no longer
use his limbs. Then there was Fox,
of Melbourne, who was fatally bitten by
snakes at the Calcutta Zoo while trying to
perfect a snake-bite serum. Much acid wit
lias been poured over the absent-minded
surgeon who leaves a swab, a pair of forceps
or a rubber glove inside a patient after an
operation. It is only fair to give a glimpse
of the shining side of the shield.

“C.D.” : Big Dan held the floor in a pub
out back, and proclaimed his virtues in a
voice like a split trombone. “I’m the high-
card fighter in this old pub,” be bellowed,,
“and don’t let no one forget it. I’ve licked
them all from Bourke to the coastline, and
I’ll fight anything, black, white or brindle,
that likes to come along.” He glared around
inquiringly, but no one offered to take him
up. “And my little mate in there,” Dan
resumed pointing towards the billiard-room,
“is the finest litttle college-clium a man ever
took the road with. He’s blown-in-the-bottle
true blue, is Bill. If anyone was to lay as
much as a finger on him I’d” Here
the sound of oaths and conflict came from
the direction of the billiard-room, and the
door burst inwards to admit a little rat-
faced person whose nose was bleeding pro-
fusely. “It’s my mate Bill,” thundered Dan.
“Who hit him?” During the silence that
followed a man strode up to Dan and halted
before him. “J did,” he said in a voice as
cold as the wind. “What about it?” Dan
gave him one look and then turned to his
injured mate, "ft serves you flamin’ well
right,” he roared; “you’re always lookin’
for trouble!”

“Loco”: “Chevrqford’s” mention of electric
shocks from motor-cars (B. 15/9/’27) re-
calls the old “750” locomotive, from which,
many years ago—before the days of motor-
cars, in fact —w r e could get a shock when-
ever we liked. All we had to do was to
make the engine blow off lightly at the
safety-valves. The vibration or something
would produce an electric current anywhere
in the cab. It was a favorite trick to get
a new shunter on the footplate and entice
him to touch some part of the cab; if he
came through the language test satisfac-
torily he was regarded as a full-blown shunter
from that time forth. There was a legend
that engine No. 49, which blew up her
boiler while ascending the Sunbury (Vic.)
bank in still earlier years, was similarly
charged with electricity. Some drivers were
half-afraid of old “75” on this account.
But I fancy she was broken up by Whelan
the Wrecker at Newport.

“The Toad”: Perhaps I shouldn’t, but
every time I pass the new concrete giant that
is rapidly going skywards on the corner of
Collins and Russell streets. Melbourne, I
think of the Girl in the Skip. When the Dook
and his Ladye were driving up Collins-street,
the specially-favored Girl was hoisted up in
the skip by one of the big cranes, and swing-
ing 100 feet above the seething multitude
she must have had a bird’s-eye view of the
procession. But those on the ground when
looking up saw more than stunting ’planes,
because one side of the skip was out.
VICTORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though Brown had ne’er ignored me yet,
I came to hate his smiling;
Those features so serenely set
Each meeting grew more riling.
When Shanks’s pony knew my weight
He’d grin from trams quick-speeding;
But when I rose to trams sedate
A flash —and then receding
His smirking phiz and waving hand
Would emphasise his sulky grand!
Oil! how I’ve cursed this transport test
With which Success he’d measure;
That Life e’er gave him of the best
But fanned his fiendish pleasure.
Alas, the trains no third could boast,
And so I travelled second ;
But, ghoul-like from the first-class host,
His grinning features beckoned.
And blast me! when to first / soared,
He waved a greeting from a Ford.
Jaw-set I, too, tried Henry’s store,
But dashed were hopes so busy;
Sedately o’er a Rolls Royce door
He beamed upon my Lizzie.
But things have changed. He’s won the
race—-
I own that he’s outclassed me
Nor would I change with him my place
If China’s tea were passed me.
Gone is the anger I would nurse—-
Brown passed me riding in a hearse!

Early in the term 250,000 16s. shares were
issued at par, one for five; when the books
closed there was only £903 to come in, paid
capital being then £1,199,097. The antici-
pated lift in the div. to 10 p.c. arrived with
the final distribution, and even so only
714 p.c. of the year’s net earnings was
handed out. With an eye upon the future
the board has moved cautiously, keeping the
div. down and sending substantial sums to
reserves, and the same policy is likely to
continue. Naturally, the new money was
not able to earn at the same rate as the old.
Variations in the return on capital and
reserves combined, after allowing for depreci-
ation, are shown hereunder :

1927.. 1,606,628 159,101 15,000 9.9
That the drop in the earning power of funds
should be so small is to the credit of the
management. Actually, in the past half-
dozen years it has been able to keep the
growth of exes, back to £72,751 while gross
profits have expanded £158,579. Thus net
lias benefited by over 54 p.c. of the in-
crease —a most creditable performance con-
sidering the rate at which taxation and
wages have climbed.
Annually the board declares that the plant
has been kept in a high state of efficiency
and that the cost has been charged 10
revenue. In 1921 the brewery, hotels, etc.,
stood at less than half the present entry.
Yet £15,000 p.a. has been regularly set
aside for depreciation over the past seven
years—it is not included with profits in the
introductory table. The amount is probably
whisked away to inner reserves, liberal pro-
vision, no doubt, having been made for all
known contingencies before p. and 1. figures
were written into the sheet. That means
that actual results have been better than
the accounts claimed. Still brewery cos.
need a long stocking, because the trade can
never be quite sure how much it will be
called upon to spend in order to protect its
investments. The position is perhaps not
so precarious as it was; yet if Australia
should have to go through a period of finan-
cial stress —as it probably must—nobody
knows what may or may not happen in the
reaction from present extravagance. “When
the devil is sick, he is a great saint.
Since 1920 £713,948 has been added to
paid capital and the book value of the
brewery, hotels, etc., has increased no less
than £1,002,824. Here are balance-sheet
figures:—
1920. 1925. 1926. 1927.
Capital . . £485,149 £999,591 £1,000,000 £1,199,097

Cash & public
securities. 22,775 13,452 7,646 19,556
During the year £68,493 was washed off the
debt. And when the books were ruled off,
the widening hotel interests and expanding
trade had lowered the stocks £20,581 and
added £85,578 to the book debts. The net
result was that the more or less liquid sur-
plus (£326,456), including stocks, was
£145,300 stronger.
The co.’s scrip climbed into favor about
seven years ago after the market had been
sweetened with a small capitalisation and
the div. rate was lifted to S| and then
9 p.c.—B p.e. had been paid since 1914.
Even in November, 1922, 19s. 3d. was the
highest quote: a year ago the price had
climbed to 28s. An investor at the latter
figure who took mi his full quota of the
last issue is now getting over 6 p.c. on his
money. Recent sales have been at 275. 3d.,
equal to 5.8 p.c. p.a. on a 10 p.c. "div. basis.
The visible backing per 16s. share amounts
to 225. 6d. in net tangibles.

The substantial improvement in the figures
attracts attention because during most of
the last 12 months trade in Brisbane lias
been quiet owing to drought and tight money.
Nevertheless, this co., which does a big
mail-order business, has been able to quicken
its turnover at small cost. Gross profit
climbed £10,774, and only £2387 was added
to the outgo:—
1925. 1926. 1927.
Gross profit .. .. £225,630 £243,438 £254,212
Exes 160,234 173,110 175,497
Net profit .. .. £65,396 £70,328 £78,715
Exes, consumed 69 p.c. of the year’s gross
earnings compared with 71.1 and 71 p.c.
in tlie two preceding terms, and net profit
represented 14.3 p.c. of paid capital com-
pared with 12-7 p.c. and 11.8 p.c. in 1926
and 1925 respectively. After paying the
div., which called for not quite 7-10ths of
the net profit, £15,236 was set aside for
taxation. Hitherto each year’s tax has been
paid out of the following year’s income ; the
amount paid last year was £12,758 —this in
addition to the amount set aside. As yet
reserves are slender and times are such that
paid capital would be none the worse for a
good deal more support. During the year
the co. was able to secure many lines for
spot cash that otherwise might not have
come their way, the chairman said. In these
days of keen competition the aim’ is a big
turnover on a small margin of profit, and
the co. which buys well and keeps exes, in
hand is able to show the best margins.
Movements in balance-sheet figures over
the past three vears compare as follows: —
1925. 1926. 1927.
Paid capital .. .. £550,000 £550,000 £550,000
Overdraft . . . . 17,633

Book debts .. .. 120,724 127,977 127,162
Cash, investments, etc. 1,655 21,747 40,641
The figures suggest that the increased trade
was for cash. The financial position was
comfortable; including stocks the liquid
surplus amounted to £333,735 (up £19,764 i.
Stocks, which are in at cost or less, have
been reduced £25,542 in the last two years,
but they are still substantial and are the
most vulnerable spot in the business. Dur-
ing the year the new premises in Barlow-
stree.t were completed and £9317 was spent
on freeholds, etc.; but £5317 was written
off. This left fixed assets with a book value
of £334,000, equal to 12s. Id. per share.
The board takes a bright view of the out-
look and expects bigger business. On the
market 245. 3d., ex Is. div., is asked for the
scrip. At that figure the return is 8.3 p-c.
on a 10 div. basis and the security amounts
to 225. 9d. per share, in net tangibles.

This co. was formed in Sydney in 1920 pri-
marily to build the Prince Edward Theatre,
and at the beginning of the table the finish-
ing touches were being put on the premises,
which were opened for business on Nov. 22,
1924. The business had been started with a
commendably small overburden of prelimi-
nary exes.; the £17.430 deficit shown as at
the end of June, 1924, included £BBl6 pre-
liminary exes., embracing brokerage and all
registration charges; the balance was chiefly
dividends paid and, of course, not earned.
There was at that date £78,915 of paid
capital; there is now £lOO,OOO, made up of
80,000 participating pref. shares and 20,000
deferred shares. The co.’s plan provides that
after the two lots have had 10 p.c. the prefs.
get two-thirds and the deferreds one-third
of the balance of the profit to be divided.
Thus in 1926 the prefs. got on their £BO,OOO
a total of £14,000 = 174 p.c.. while the de-
ferreds got £6OOO on their £20,000 = 30 p.c.
For the past year the prefs. get £lO.OOO =
124 p.c., and the deferreds £3333 = 16§ p.c.
The big bump in earnings in 1926 was the
result of the sale of the Victoria Arcade,
upon which a profit of £24.619 was made;
that, of course, isn’t likely to be repeated,
and the figures for 1925 and 1927 are much
more like the normal. As to the amounts
shown as written off there is some doubt.
The amounts are reserved “for taxation and
other charges” (that fund is £5750) and “for
depreciation of plant, machinery and furnish-
ings” (£6500). It is obvious that so far
taxation has been charged direct to Profit
and Loss; and no calls have yet been made
on the other, reserve. Still the building and
equipment are new, and outgoings on account
of repairs and refurnishing must be pretty
small so far. The directors are prudent to
reserve these earnings; but it is probable that
a very fair part of them can be still re-
garded as true profit. The co. was carrying
a heavy load of debt just before the theatre
was finished: loans on mortgage were
£161.793 as at June 30, 1924, and sundry
creditors £8839. The sale of the arcade and
the nice profit immediately won from the
theatre had enabled the directors to work
the mortgage down to £60,350 at the end
of last June; and while sundry creditors
stood at £4014, cash in hand, etc., was
£11,020. It is a very excellent performance.
The directors are G. R. W. McDonald
(chairman), the two Carrolls and E. J.
Tait, C. A. Jaques and T. ,T. Marks.

Fluctuations in the wool, hide and tallow
markets over - the past decade have played
some queer tricks with the figures in that
table. A world shortage in raw hides
strengthened the demand and stiffened the
price in the latter half of last term, and
wool sold at a pretty steady figure all the
year round; so net profits climbed £8686 and
were equal to 11.7 p.c. of paid capital com-
pared with 9.6 p.c., a loss, 15.1 and 18.7 p.c.
back to 1923. The div. was lifted a point,
but that point called for less than half the
increase in the profit, and nearly one-third
of the year’s net earnings was sent to
strengthen the attenuated reserves. They
are described as nominal in the table be-
cause an unspecified amount of goodwill is
mixed up with freeholds and plant—it is
believed to be small, but should be separated.
In addition there is a depreciation reserve
(£31,995) and suspense account (£41,468,
up £13,179) which are not reckoned with
accumulations above. A glance at the 1921
and 1925 figures makes obvious the neces-
sity for very substantial reserves in this
class of business. In the first half of the
latter year results justified 5 p.c. being
handed to shareholders, but in the second
half the co. was caught with heavy stocks
on a falling market, and what looked like
a decent profit half-way through the term
was turned into a loss of £61,948 at the end
of the year.
Here are balance-sheet figures:—
1921. 1924. 1926. 1927.
Paid capital. . £400,000 £400,000 £400,000 £400,000

Cash . . . . 13,439 1,947 794 1,199
The financial position has lately improved.
The £64,092 added to liabilities together with
the year’s surplus earnings went into book
debts (£224,289. up £95,248), which added
to cash made the liquid surplus £12,517
compared with £19,044 of an excess of lia-
bilities at the close of the previous accounts.
Stocks were a trifle lower; they were only
74 p.c. of the 1924 figure. Nevertheless,
with the high prices now ruling their valu-
ation is important and the current year’s
profits partly depend upon that.
The market, which measures the risks
with caution, pays only 19s. 3d. for the £1
shares. The return to the investor at that
figure is 8.3 p.c. p.a. on an 8 p.c. div. basis.
The net tangible backing amounts to 235. 9d.
per share, subject to the goodwill men-
tioned above.

More wool came into the co.’s store last
year than in the previous season—s3,l37
bales compared with 47,524 —and it was all
sold, though turnover was not so good. How-
ever, returns from the produce, shipping,
livestock and other departments lifted gross
profits £6513, the extra cost was £4923 and
the balance made net profit 10.2 p.c. of
paid capital compared with 9.4 p.c. in the
previous year. The average net return on
capital for the past five years has been
10.6 p.c. compared with 10.5 p.c. in the
preceding quinquennium. The steady 7 p.c.
handed to shareholders has called for only
two-thirds of the net earnings since 1923,
thus leaving £30,991 in the business. Never-
theless, it has taken 14 years to build up
reserves £11,374 in excess of goodwill
(£50,000). The co. is very solidly en-
trenched in the Mallee and western Victoria.
Except for a branch in Melbourne, it has
never moved out of those districts; conse-
quently its development has been slow.
The next comparison shows what it has
cost to handle the business won since 1920:

Owing to high prices for wool and produce
£50,000 of new capital had to be got in to
finance clients over a couple of years back.
That helped gross earnings, which improved
£34.492 over the last four years; but exes,
gobbled up £31,942 of it, and were 77.8
p.c. of gross compared with 78, 71 and 73.6
p.c. in the three preceding terms. In 1920
the ratio was only 63.3 p.c. The difficulty
will be to make adequate cuts in bad seasons
and so ensure the 7 p.c. div.

good that clients, despite the tightness of
money, were able to liquidate £30,216 of
their debt to the co. That and a reduction
of £40,261 in stocks enabled the board to
lighten the amount due to creditors by
£38,773. But the liquid surplus remained
practically unchanged at £115,079. A year
ago the market, priced the scrip at 225., but
under the dull conditions now prevailing
sellers are back to 21s. At the middle price
(20s. 9d.) the return is a shade better than

The profit claimed by the accounts was
£18,651, but £1397 of that goes to a reserve
for bad and doubtful debts, leaving the
exact amount required to pay the pref. charge
and the usual 10 p.c. to the ords. Early in
the term 62,775 7| p.c. cum. prefs. were
issued; most of the money went to reduce
the debt, and net profits benefited. But the
year’s turnover increased too. The delivery
system was reorganised. The result was a
large saving in exes., the board says. But
the improvement there was apparently
eaten up by forward expenditure on the in-
dent business of Kemp, Campbell and Co.,
which was bought in 1926 for 12,225 Aus-
tralian Drug £1 ords., issued at a premium
of £2278. Between the lot declared net earn-
ings, after deducting the pref. requirements,
were 10 p.c. on the ord. capital compared
with 11, 8.2, 10 and 11.2 p.c. back to 1923.
It is reasonable to assume that future earn-
ings should benefit by the forward expendi-
ture on the new agency business.
And earnings can do with help. Although
shareholders have received a regular 10 p.c.
p.a. for the past 15 years, it has been a
struggle to do it of late. Over the past seven
years distributions have exceeded net earn-
ings by £llB2, and the total visible lay-by
amounted to only 16 p.c. of paid capital at
June 30. Unearned increment has provided
some hidden strength in the freeholds, but
that cannot always be realised. A little over

a couple of years back the co. built itself

Australian Natives’ Association, Ltd.
—The management is not pleased with com-
ments recently made in The Bulletin. It
complains chiefly that its revenue for 1020
was understated by £4227. The Bulletin
did not say that the figures it quoted ex-
pressed the co.’s total revenue. What it
did say was: “The last revenue account
showed £40,403 received from premiums of
one sort and another, most of them ‘lndus-
trial branch weekly premiums’; and whereas
the claims paid were £2859, expenses ran
away with £38,051.” That is quite true.
It is also true, as the management claims,
that, in this mixed insurance office and
friendly society, frielidly-society contribu-
tions were £3274 and interest £010; and
it is also possibly true that part of the
£2850 paid out in “death, sickness and acci-
dent claims” was in respect of friendly-
society claims. But that does not improve the
position from the insurance point of view. It
means, instead, that, apart from “return
of premiums at death” (£63), less than
£2850 was paid by way of insurance bene-
fits, whereas the receipts were £40,404. And
general expenses (including presumably the
expenses of the little friendly-society busi-
ness) totalled no less than £38,652. Assum-
ing that the whole of the friendly-society
revenue went in expenses, then against a total
insurance-premium revenue of £40,404, the
general expenses in that section were
£35,378.
The balance-sheet claims that the
“accumulated funds” of this co. are £23,639.
Actually to represent this sum and the co. s
liabilities (£4039), apart altogether from
liabilities under the policies in force, there
are Commonwealth loans and cash, £12,002 :
office furniture and motor vehicles, sundry
debtors and bills receivable, stationery
(£250) and odds and ends. £3859; the
balance of “accumulated funds” consists of
“establishment account,” £ll,BlB. This
establishment account consists of money that
has been spent and for which the co. can
show nothing tangible—not even stationery
or motor vehicles. But even more impudent
than this claim of “accumulated funds,”
which consist largely of money spent, is an
advertisement that “the A.N.A., though not
as yet actually amalgamated throughout the
Commonwealth, is working in sympathy,
with a total membership exceeding 50.000
and with funds totalling about three-quarters
of a million.” How much “sympathy” there
is may be judged by the fact that the
general secretary of the A.N.A. in Victoria
has published the following notice: —
The A.N.A., Victoria, asserts that by advertise-
ments, representations and otherwise, the A.N.A.,
Ltd., is using its name to lead and probably has led
persons dealing with such co. to suppose that they
are dealing with the Australian Natives’ Association,
Victoria.
The management of A.N.A., Ltd., tells
The Bulletin that it has not written any
business in Victoria since January of this
year. Unless the co. mends its ways and
contrives to do business at much less cost, it
should not be allowed to do business any-
where.

Australia is just beginning to discover the
“Wild Cat” Monthly; as a matter of fact
the Monthly is only beginning to discover
itself. For some time it was little more than
a reprint of Bulletin “Wild ,Cat” reviews, a
thin little thing prepared mainly for filing
purposes. During the past year or so exten-
sions and improvements have been made
every quarter; and to-day the Monthly con-
tains far more information than any other
financial journal ever published in Aus-
tralia. These changes wouldn’t have been
possible but for the extraordinary growth
of the list of subscribers—soo have come
from Melbourne alone during the past month.
The financial out(ook is so obscure, the
markets so uncertain, that the wise investor
will use every means available to guide him
in either selling or buying shares and other
securities. No effort is being spared to make
the Monthly a useful guide. One subscriber
writes: “I am sorry I did not get acquainted
with the ‘Wild Cat’ Monthly eight months
earlier. It would have saved me over £BOO,
and I am only a small investor.” The next
number will be published on Saturday next,
October 1.

Amalgamated Broken Hill has got six
months’ exemption and shut down while it
carries on negotiations for the sale abroad if
200,000 shares at 10s. With this £lOO,OOO,
if it materialises, it is proposed to erect a
concentration plant on the Great Western
apd Centennial mines. Failing foreign
money, 100,000 shares paid up to Bs. will be
issued at Is. to give £5OOO with which to
send a mission to New Yawk to form a new
co. The mission is sure to have a good time
on £5OOO, but the betting is against its suc-
cess. The directors had a geophysical sur-
vey made of Block 3, adjoining the North
Broken mine, that disclosed “valuable ore
deposits.” But no geophysical method can
tell whether a mineral deposit is valuable
or not. The value of ore deposits depends on
what tlieir contents yield after treatment on
the surface and for how much those con-
tents are sold. “The Great Western geo-
physical test was also highly satisfactory,
showing ore bodies to 135 ft. wide, and on
the Centennial mine pood ore bodies.” The
adjectives are reckless. Geophysics can
locate ore bodies, but not tell their value.

Carpathia (N.S.W.) is in the drought
country, and had to shut down for want
of water bn February 12. It operated for
only 10 days in its last half-year; and there
has been no rain of value since. Half-a
dozen men have been kept on, breaking ore
where it could be stored, and generally over-
hauling plant, etc. Fortunately the co. had
a cosy bank balance ; and. with tin-sales bring-
ing in £2603, there still remained £5636 on
deposit at July 31. Total liquid assets
(including the deposit) were £8948; total
liabilities, £1244. The co. has missed a line
tin market; but with the first good rain it
is in a position to earn tidy profits.

Queensland’s Mines Department has been
scratching together interesting figures about
the gem-mining industry at Anakie. There is
no record of sales, but production is guessed
to have ranged from £23,116 in 1909 to
£46,524 in 1921, when the Government buy-
ing monopoly began. The biggest year was
1920, when £65,831 worth was unearthed.
The smallest was £6OO in 1915. In the first
year of Government buying purchases were
£34,650, and sales £38.385. There were no
sales next year, and in 1926, when State buy-
ing was discontinued, the Government bought
nothing and sold £l5 worth. Total purchases
were £122,000, and total sales £80,248, so the
experiment seems to have cost the State
£41,752, less the value of the gems pre-
sumably in hand. The prohibition of pri-
vate buying is still in force, though illicit
buyers are operating. With the Government
buttoned up, nothing else could be expected
and the sooner the ban is lifted, or the Trea-
sury opened again, the better for the har-
assed gem-miner and the legitimate buyer.

The August gold returns for Queensland
make melancholy reading. The total output
for the month was 29260 z. fine, and the
fast-finishing Mount Morgan contributed
23200 z. of it. The Mount expects to clean
up its last reserves of slimes and concen-
trates by the end of this year, and with
that the curtain will ring down, to all intents
and purposes. Mt. Coolon, with 2930 z., as
compared with 3630 z. for August last year, is
the only other producer worthy of notice
in the northern State. The total yield for
the eight months ending August 31 was
15 9940 z., valued at £67.938, as against
57910 z., valued at £24,597, for the same
period last year. As to next year’s returns,
the less said about them the better.

111 view of the numerous but indefinite
reports of the discovery of well-defined reef
formations on the upper Edie and Merri
Creeks there is some interest in the addition
to the Sydney Stock Exchange list of Morobe
Guinea Gold, N.L. Authorised capital of
this mostly Adelaide spec, is £200,000 in
400.000 shares of 10s. each. Subscribed
capital comprises 150,000 f.p. shares, of
which 30,000 have been issued to the ven-
dors, and 180,000 contribs. paid to 2s. The
other 70,000 are in reserve. As to the co.’s
possibilities and possessions generally, they
are shrouded in the customary haze of opti-
mism that obscures the no doubt transcen-
dent merits of these N.G. flotations.

Shareholders in Waihi (M.L.) who have
been blaming tlieir London board for ultra-
conservatism in hoarding gilt-edged securities
instead of distributing some assets get a wind-
fall in the capitalisation of £125,000 of the
co.’s reserves, which total about £340.000.
They are offered the option of taking either
one new share for every old, face value 55.,
or 10s. worth of 6 per cent, debentures.
Waihi has been paying 2s. annually in divs.
without difficulty, and the prospect of Is. at
least, probably more, after this doubling of
the capital, seems to justify a sporting risk
in taking up the shares.

Great Boulder has no very large interests
nowadays in outside ventures. The chief are
5000 shares in the Wiluna Development Syn-
dicate, Ltd., and 2000 shares in the Wiluna
Gold Corporation, whose holding is “likely to
become one of the big goldmines of the
world.” The Carmen Valley Gold Mines,
Ltd., in Columbia, in which the Great Boul-
der owns 100,000 ss. shares, is still a source
of expense, but it is stated that “difficulties
of unwatering have been overcome and that
values in the lowest level are very promising.”

Big Bell, near Cue, once described as
Westralia’s widest and longest gold-bearing
formation, is being worked again after a year
or more of idleness. Open-cutting 100 ft.
wide with a scrap-iron plant, its original
owners failed to make 10s. recovery pay, and
the W. A. Bank and State Mining Depart-
ment, which followed, barely “broke even” on
a treatment of a fairly large tonnage. Then
the late Dorrie Doolette and others took a
hand, but failed to make ends meet. Under
present conditions it is even more doubtful
if the show will be a success.

iCoolgardie (W.A.) is whooping about
some rich values struck by the Government
diamond-drill operating on the old Tindals
mine. The first bore disclosed a big body of
low-grade ore at a vertical depth of several
hundred feet from the surface, and the second
penetrated rock deeper still assaying in places
up to 6oz. per ton. In the past the draw-
backs to the Tindals and several other dead-
and-gone surrounding shows were narrow,
rapidly-dipping, short-lived shoots and hard
ground. Interest in them was sustained for
a time by picked returns, but the end in
most cases came early. It is hardly likely
that any of them will improve in deeper
ground, but some may furnish an occasional
crushing.
London-controlled Star Emerald Co.
(W.A.) is again talking about its prospects,
and share-pushers are busy at work. The
latest official story is that a large deposit
of gem-bearing material has been struck,
and that, as the Colombian mine in South
America is nearly worked out, the Star Emer-
ald show will shortly be the only producer
in the wide world. Despite all this boost,
however, no cut Westralian gems appear to
have yet been sold. The market, noting this,
is sick.
* * * *
Menzies (W.A.) has hopes of an early
revival. Good returns are being obtained
from one old claim and loz. to 2oz. values
are reported to have been struck in another.
The experience of the past, however, is that
Menzies shoots can’t be relied on at a depth.
Those that look well to-day may die to-
morrow.

Sydney Siam, a holding and prospecting
co., with a paid-up capital of £30,000, is
about to issue another 10,000 shares. These
are to be offered to shareholders, one for
three. The new money may be used to pay
for the check boring of ceftain Malayan tin
propositions ; but the recent return to Sydney
of an engineer who has been investigating
some of the New Guinea leases, allegedly on
behalf of Sydney Siam interests, has given
rise to a suspicion that the new money is
required in this latter connection.

Selayang, the British Malayan float which
had Australian origins, found it necessary to
ask its shareholders, at the ahnual meeting,
for a trifle more cash to carry on with. The
long-delayed dredge had set in, with a fairly
satisfactory return for a starting flutter, and
the request of the directors caused a mild
surprise on this side, where a fair percentage
of shares are held. Capital was £140,000, in
£1 shares, f.p. Shareholders were asked for
£35,000 more, to be collected by the issue of
35,000 new shares at £1 each, these to be
issued at a premium of Is.; and be payable
11s. on application and 10s. on allotment.
Shareholders are offered 25,000 of the new
shares pro rata to present holdings. The
other 10,000 have been taken by the under-
writers of the issue. Reasons given for call-
ing up the extra cash are that delay in the
delivery of the dredge, due to the British
coal strike, seriously impeded the commence-
ment of profit-returning work, and added to
the continuing overhead costs. Money had
to be borrowed to meet the extra costs,
and the increase of capital w T as necessary to
repay this. The new' issue will wipe off bor-
rowings and leave enough cash in hand to
carry on till the first serious tin returns
come in.

Silaya, a Sydney holding and prospecting
concern with an eye on Malayan and Siamese
options, was registered in December last,
with C. McDowell as chairman and J. 11.
King and A. Vickery as co-directors. The
co. is not rushing things, and beyond vague
reports of options being acquired and tested,
not much nows has come of its activities.
One small proposition near Mergui, in
Southern Burma, is said to be attractive, as
far as the boring tests go. Vickery has
recently returned from the ground, and re-
ports are abroad that the optioned area is
easily accessible to a dredge working in from
the sea. So no one need be surprised to
hear of a flotation as soon as the market
brisks up a bit.
* * * *
Ronpibon Tin, a Melbourne flotation of
as long ago as 1!)16, has announced that it
has disposed of its property at Thalern,
some four miles from the Ronpibon pro-
perty in Southern Siam. The Thalern area
has been on the co.’s hands for some time,
and has had a book value of £11,046. The
new co. which has acquired the area is a
London concern, Talerng Tin Dredging, and
is paying for the purchase of Ronpibon's
leases at Thalern with £6OOO in cash and
54,000 f.p. 10s. shares. Talerng’s capital
is £300,000 in 600,000 shares of 10s. each,
and the co. is understood to have acquired
an extra area surrounding the Thalern
leases, proved to contain 36,000,000 c.y.,
averaging ,661 b. to the yard. The Ronpibon
Thalern leases were estimated to contain
about 5,000,000 yards of 21b. ground. The
whole area is said to be deep and free
dredging—no. details given—and a dredge
with a capacity of 200,000 yai'ds per month
and digging to a depth of 75ft. is to get to
work on it, with another of the same
capacity to follow. Shipment of the first
pontoon is to be made from London some
time in October. It seems a pity, with such
a rich area as the Thalern leases in its
possession, though the yardage is admittedly
small, Ronpibon could not turn this 21b.
ground to its own advantage. It could have
done with something of the sort.

Vic. Assembly smiled as it watched law-
yer Blackburn belaboring fellow-worker
Slater, Labor Attorney-General, for bring-
ing forward a bill to put a brake on vexa-
tious law suits. Blackburn protested against
general restriction because there were a few
cranks. The smile was evoked not so much
by the argument as by the conflict between,
two who used to be so closely associated.
Slater served his year in Blackburn’s office
after he had been admitted to practice and
then became a partner. Had Blackburn not
stood down rather than oppose Prendergast
at the election of Labor Ministers he, and
not Slater, would have been Law Minister.
Anyway the bill was kept on the waiting
list.
“Old Unionist” : Jawbone Neild may not
have been Australia’s most conceited poli-
tician, but he was in the running. Although
scandalised at the presence of Laborites in
E. A. BUTTENSHAW, Leader of the
N.S.W. Country party.
Parliament Neild pandered to the growing
Labor vote. A Labor official called on him
to convey thanks for an unexpected conces-
sion. “You didn’t expect it?” queried Neild,
puffing his chest. “Well, it was a miracle
you got it! The calendar is full of saints
who were reputed to be able to work
miracles, but. let me tell you, only God or
John Cash Neild could have worked this
one!”
Desmond Kirby, who was cremated at
Rookwood (Sydney) a few days ago, had
been known on half the mining fields of
Australia during the past 50 years. His
unconquerable optimism survived even an ex-
plosion which cost him an eye, shattered a
hand and left him almost totally deaf. The
last venture with which he was going to
make millionaires of his friends was the
Digger Prince —that it might make him rich,
too, wasn’t half as important as that it
should fill the pockets of those who had been
kind to him in his frequent lean days. He
was still lamenting that they had dug in
the wrong place when illness drove him into
the North Shore Hospital and then to Lid-
combe, where he died.
Frank Edwards, of Lynton station, near
Goulburn (N.S.W.), got a warm send-off
from his mates of
Goul b u r n Polo
Club and from the
local landed gentry
wh e n h e left to
take charge of a
new station ac-
quired by his dad
near Inverell. The
young man is an
athlete of parts,
for, in addition to
polo, he cut a
figure in Sydney
G.P.S. athletics a
few years ago, win-
ning the champion-
ship for the best
all - rounder when
he was 18. His
record for the 440
hurdles, in the Aus-
tralasian schools
championships a t
Adelaide still
stands.
Group-Captain
WILLIAMS, of
the Australian
Air Force—
a Moonta boy
he was, and grew
up with Oswald
Pryor’s friends.
At a spread which followed the last annual
meeting of the Towoiig Shire Council at Tal-
langatta (Vic.) the local mathematician cal-
culated that Peter Sutherland, during his 39
years’ unbroken representation of the Murray
Riding, had ridden a distance equal to the
circumference of the earth, with something
to spare, for he had pushed his horse weekly
over 40 miles of bridle-tracks through the
Australian Alps to look after shire business.
Secretary W. H. Maddock owned up to 30
years’ continuous service, and journalist
James Law blushingly admitted having taken
notes of meetings for over 40 years.
The professional politician figures promin-
ently on the nomination papers for the com-
ing N. S. Wales elections —16 candidates
call themselves M.L.A. The land is claimed
by most, there being 27 farmers and graziers
and one orchardist. Fourteen candidates pur-
sue costs and fees at the Bar, 12 mark them-
selves down as agents, and 10 as journalists.
There are nine auctioneers, eight account-
ants, seven engineers, six clerks, five each
of builders, miners, secretaries and tram-
men. Groups of three include “retired,"’
“independent means,” organisers, manufac-
turers and storemen; three of the five women
mark themselves “domestic duties.” One
is a nurse; the other, a manager. Amongst
those present are also a professor of music
and two medical practitioners.
Mercer, in the Waikato (Maoriland), has
just been visited by one of its boys: M. A.
Hunter, professor of electro-chemistry and
electro-metallurgy at the Rensselaer ' Poly-
technic Institute, the oldest engineering
school in America. Mat Hunter won an
1851 Exhibition scholarship in 1902 and hied
him to the Cold Country in pursuit of higher
knowledge. He says this is the age of
metals, and is urging ambitious young
Maorilanders to make it their profession.
The Reverend I. Morris, who has been
shepherd of the Chosen in Newcastle for
15 years, at last has a synagogue. Previ-
ously the Newcastle faithful held their meet-
ings in a hired hall. It has been a iong
wait; plans for a synagogue were drawn in
1912, when Morris, at the invitation of Sam,
eldest son of George Judah Cohen, accepted
the office.
Maurice Dudley, 3LO’s announcer, some
time ago swallowed a fly while at the micro-
phone. The shock made him record the in-
cident in words. A month, later he got a
letter from a listener in Yokohama solemnly
reporting that the remark had been received
clearly. Probably the Jap thought that it
was an unusual Australian supper.
Social life and fraternity among members
of Vic. Parliament have not been improved
by the return to the Spring-street building.
Members are not mixing, and the new sur-
roundings are blamed. Tile long lounge on
the ground floor in the temporary Parlia-
ment House at the Exhibition was a
friendly place. All rooms and the two
chambers led on to it. When tired of letter-
writing or party meetings, or of the group
that had exhausted its yarns, members could
move into the lounge and chum up with
other legislators, with officers, or men of
ink. Now they are everywhere and any-
where —mostly in party rooms. Ministers
have set the fashion in exclusiveness. The
aloofness of Priminister Baldwin is nothing
compared with that of Premier Hogan. He
is probably too busy to remember that there
are four men on the other side at least as
great as he who were also Premiers and
who are now in the ranks of private mem-
bers.
Maoriland has at least one citizen who
describes himself as a poet for purposes of
the census. He is Wladislas Vaile Potocki
de Montalk. He was once a law-clerk and
then became a milkman, after which he
became a bankrupt and then a poet. Accord-
ing to his wife, who recently asked the
Supreme Court for an order for restitution
of conjugal rights, the high-souled one de-
voted himself to the Muse to the exclusion
of all other interests. He could not make
a living at it, but that didn’t damp his ardor.
In a letter to his wife he complained bitterly
that Peruland was a land of “white savages
and All Blacks,” which treated its poets
badly, whereas in Merrie England they were
“feted, laurelled and crowned.” He wound
up by saying that he was going to take “the
golden road to Samarkand.”
Mick Kirwan, Queensland’s Minister for
Public Works, is in a tight corner with his
Labor league, and his avoirdupois won’t make
it easy for him to get out of the fight his
comrades insist on staging. Time was when
the burly .Cabinet Minister was thin enough
to pass through the iron bars of Brisbane
central station gates. Then he roared the
cobwebs down with his stentorian announce-
ments of trains. During the Brisbane tram
strike in 1012 Mick, w’ho lived in the
suburbs, swore he would never ride in Bad-
ger’s tramcars again. But the cars have
passed out of the hands of Private Enter-
prise, and Mick for quite a while-has had
the right to a limousine.
The Royal Historical Society of Australia
suffered a loss when Frederick Phillips,
one of its founders, passed out at 85. He
was secretary of the old A.S.N. Co., but
later launched out as an auditor and public
accountant. He was a free giver of service
to public causes; for 27 years he was con-
nected with the Deaf and Dumb and Blind
Asylum.
The latest job handed out by the Lang
Government has gone to a brother-in-law
of Jock Garden, Wallace T. Ritchie, who
becomes president of the Silicosis Joint Com-
mittee, which will allocate compensation to
sewer-miners and rockchoppers who get rock-
dust on their lungs. Among Ritchie’s qualifi-
cations for the job (apart from’ his relation-
ship with Garden) is the fact that he has
been assistant-secretary of the Labor Coun-
cil. Before he was handed that job, 10 years
ago, he was a railway employee. His special
duty has been to watch the Workmen’s Com-
pensation Act and give advice on claims,
and the unionists wanted him to be placed
on the Compensation Commission, But that
went to Baddeley’s protege. Gordon Ilalli-
day, clerk in the Newcastle office of the
Miners’ Union.
F. R. Beasley, 8.A., LL.B., goes from
Sydney to take the Chair of Daw in the Uni-
versity of W.A. Having seen the war
through as a member of the 11th Batt.,
A.1.F., he went to Oxford, where he picked
up his B.A. The LL.B. was gathered after-
wards in Sydney, where the newly-appointed
Professor, in addition to his private and Uni-
versity work, was secretary of the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, the local
branch of the League of Nations Union and
the Institute of Pacific Relations.
The cable reported a tragic end to a
modern knightly adventure. The St. George
was the British Pathologist Professor Adrian
Stokes, who went to Lagos, Equatorial
Africa, to beard the dragon of yellow fever in
its lair. He had written of a discovery
which meant a triumph over the disease.
And then his death was announced—from
yellow fever. The scientific world hopes that
he placed the full account of the battle on
record to become his imperishable memorial.
The death of Tom Okines, Tas. Attorney-
General Ogilvie’s partner, set Hobart talk-
ing. It happens that a Royal Commission
is inquiring into the administration of the
Public Trust Office and certain transactions
between that office and the law firm _ of
Okines and Ogilvie, and the sudden passing
of Okines was reckoned a suspicious circum-
stance. But apparently the only connection
is that the publicity given in the course of
the inquiry to matters of a confidential char-
acter as between solicitor and clients seems
to have been regarded by Okines as likely,
to seriously injure his business as an old-
established family lawyer, and the attendant
worry plus insomnia upset his mental bal-
ance. A rifle-shot in his office ended things.
James Davidson was a rare specimen of
that fast-vanishing Australian type, the Cobb
and Co. mail-coach driver. For years his
run was between Surat and Yeulba, in
South-western Queensland, and of th“
thousands whom he “personally conducted”
on that rather dreary route, there were few
who were not his friends before the trip was
over. He began life as head stockman on
Dareel, one of the Australian Pastoral Co.’s
holdings, and when he left the saddle for the
box, he stayed there for 30 years. A mag-
nificent hand with horses, he could not bring
himself to handle the motor-cars that drove
the old six-horse coaches off the road, and
spent the latter days of his life in farming
in the district he knew so well. He was
72 when he took the long track.
A thrill of pride ran through Sydney Uni-
versity when the M.B. and B.S. degrees were
handed to Alan Joseph Canny. Canny went
from the Grammar School to the Uni. in 1921
and started lifting honors free-hand style.
At two examinations he was the only student
to secure “high distinction.” His prizes
include the Renwick scholarship, John Harris
anatomy and physiology scholarship, Clap-
ham Memorial Prize, the Craig Prize for
operative surgery, and, at the finish, the Uni-
versity Medal, Professor Mills’s prize for
clinical medicine and the Sandes and Hinder
Memorial prizes for clinical surgery. He
got his B.Sc. degree in 1924, with the Uni-
versity medal for physiology, and after that
resumed his studies in medicine.
Michael Burke for several years has car-
ried on a private war in the Sydney suburb
of St. Peters. Burke acquired some land
and, dumping a second-hand tramcar upon
it, proceeded to take up residence. The local
councillors objected, but they failed to shift
the bellicose old chap. When sundry coun-
cillors entered the premises with the idea of
bringing him to reason, he chased them with
an axe. But the caboose caught fire one
recent night, and Burke, in trying to save
it, landed himself in hospital badly burned.
When Market-street, Sydney, was quite
suburban in appearance, Mrs. Mary Prince
started business as a confectioner there;
and there she stayed for 50 years, while the
two-storey houses were superseded by struc-
tures raising themselves to the building
limit. A few years ago the old lady retired
from business ; but it had become so much
a habit with her that she suffered a sense
of loss right up to the time of her death.
One of her daughters is the wife of Percy
Coleman, M.H.R. for Reid.
Professor G. H. BLAKESLIE, Carnegie
Professor of International Relations at
Clark University, U.S.A., who is de-
livering University Extension lectures

Major-General Cecil Foott, whose pro-
motion is gazetted with his appointment as
honorary A.D.C. to the King, is nowadays
Commandant of the forces in his native State
of Queensland. A son of Mary Hannay
Foott, the poetess, he took to soldiering soon
after leaving Brisbane Grammar School,
joining up with the old Submarine Miners,
a section of the State-controlled Engineers.
He moved on to the permanent forces in due
course, and continued in the Sappers till the
argument with Fritz gave him a chance to
'show his quality as an engineer. His work
in France showed him to be one of the
soundest of Australia’s professional soldiers.
ODE TO A SHEEP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O sheep, whose days are so demurely spent,
I wonder if it’s past your comprehending
That you and I between us represent
The starting of a process and its ending?
On you the wool, on me the cloth and hose—
Thus runs the cycle from its start to close!
But not direct, old thing—Oh not direct!
’Twixt shearing you and my spring-suiting
choices
There intervenes a host of the elect
Who jazz around in Daimlers and Rolls
Royces ;
Well-nourished coves with apoplectic necks,
Who drink champagne and sign colossal
cheques.
Adown the path from you to me they stand
(Who tries to dodge them only comes a
cropper),
And each with outstretched and expectant
hand
Collects the tribute that he thinks is
proper.
Your wool would stand on end if you could
see
The final price at which it’s charged to me.
Therefore I call you comrade from my heart,
Although we two adorn a different genus ;
If you and I are plainly in the cart,
At least we share the vehicle between us.
We have one point in common, Brother
Beast —
We both exist in order to be fleeced.

“Anthrop”: The method of firemaking
mentioned by “Mullarula” (B. 25/S/’27)
has been recorded by cinematograph at
Ooldea, Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie railway.
The film is part of the anthropological out-
fit of Adelaide Uni.
“Cartot”: “Mako” is wrong in assuming
that the process of shrinking human heads
is carried out by heat (B. l/9/’27). The
agents used are vegetable drugs of a power-
fully astringent nature. The skill of the
operator plays its part in the removal of
portions of the skull unaffected by the astrin-
gents; this is done by slitting
the scalp at the back in a
straight line from the neck to
the crown, and cutting across
to the ears and down to the
forehead. These incisions en-
able the skull to be removed,
and it is then replaced with
clay and leaves made into a ball
the size to which it is intended
to shrink the head. The pro-
cess varies in detail all over
the world, but in essentials is
the same in countries which are
as far apart as Colombia, South
America, and Dutch New
Guinea, in both of which I have
seen specimens of the head-
shrinker’s art. The significance
of the custom is unknown, but
it is possible that its distribu-
tion on both sides of the Pacific
is the result of the culture
migration which took place across the ocean
in past ages.

“AdeL.” :” The Indian hawker had visited
our locality. Of all his shoddy goods none
fascinated the station gins so much as his
parasol-like Japanese hats, with their dainty
lace, rice straws and imitation-silk ribbons.
One of these treasures was lifted from its
owner’s head by a whirlwind. As I watched
its erratic movements a wedge-tailed eagle
swooped down, caught the escaped hat and
soared up with the capture. I focused my
field-glasses and saw him make for a distant
cliff. Riding in the vicinity a few days later.
I decided to inspect the spot where I had
seen the eagle alight. I climbed the face
of the cliff and reached a ledge upon which,
over a few crosswise sticks, was neatly tucked
the lost hat. Closer examination showed
that Mrs. Eagle had laid an egg in its
crown. I tried to photograph this curio in
nests, but had to reckoii with two angry
birds swooping dangerously near my head,
so I desisted from my attempt to obtain
what would have proved a rarity in natural-
history pictures. I have known of magpies
and crows carrying discarded hats to
their nests, but never before of eagles annex-
ing lace and ribbons for cradles.

“Condrew”: Old-timers may remember
“Professor” McGilvery, who toured the
Queensland backblocks in the ’nineties giving
horse-breaking exhibitions at the stations.
McGilvery offered to forfeit a fiver if he
failed to mount any unbroken horse, without
saddle or bridle, within eight minutes from
the time it entered the yard, and he generally
did mount them. Rumors were rife that drugs,
mesmeric influences or other such means
were employed by him, but none had any
foundation in truth. Mac’s secret was a
knowledge of horses and their anatomy. He
always gave his exhibitions in a small round
yard, about 12 feet across. Standing in the
centre, he sent the unbroken youngster can-
tering round, the circling motion having the
effect of keeping the animal’s feet well under-
neath him and lessening his scope for kick-
ing. Gradually working in on his victim,
McGilvery would grab the mane about six
inches up from the withers and give it a
terrific jerk. This temporarily affected the
steed’s spine and brought him to a halt. Mac

“Pfella”: A cool- nigger was Tommy Lap-
foot, a North-Westralian. Many a day I
have watched him breaking an outlaw, puff-
ing out clouds of smoke from an old black
pipe stuck fast between his white teeth
while the moke bucked his dinner out. Once
he mounted a big raw stallion well away
from the station stockyard, and the beast
treated him to a flying buck for over a hun-
dred yards, finally disappearing suddenly
over the steep river-bank. The watercourse
Avas dry at the time except for a big rock-
pool over 14 feet deep, where Tommy and
the stallion went over. Fearing the worst,
I dashed to the edge, and saw the horse
swimming out with the drenched Binglii still
aboard, and his pipe sticking out of his
mouth but smokeless. “You got it match?"
inquired Tommy complacently. “Water bin
put it pipe all out."

“Landa": If “Adah" (B. 8/9/27) will
take a walk along the heights of Rose Bay,
Sydney, and along the cliffs from Bondi to
Watson’s Bay, he will see and hear numbers
of English skylarks. Twenty years ago they
were numerous at Fisherman’s Bend, Port
Melbourne, and also on Coode Island and the
reclaimed West Melbourne swamp. I have
seen and heard them in the places men-
tioned ; strange to shy, although I lived for
years right at Centennial Park, I never heard

sight of the common groundlark and the song
of the reed-warblers in the rushes on the

“G.R.F.”: The old-time pearl thieves men-
tioned by “Sea Nomad” (B. 25/8/27) must
have been supermen if they wrenched open
pearl-oyster shells under water in the man-
ner he describes. I was in charge of the
luggers of the Ethel pearling station, out of
Broome (W.A.), in the late ’nineties. For
months on end I collected shell from the
boats and superintended its opening, at times
engaging in the operation myself. The pearl-
oyster shell averages seven inches across, and
is thickly encrusted with a lime-like sub-
stance that makes it awkward to handle with
the bare hands. The shell is opened by
inserting a thin-bladed knife, which kills the
bivalve, and the two sections then fall
apart as if on a hinge in the heel or thick
part of the shell. The best pearls are found
in a small film bag in the lips of the shell —
the parts furthest away from the heel —but
are met with frequently in the oyster itself.
The latter contingency necessitates the flesh
being pressed with the hands and c-arefullj
examined. After the bivalve has beer
scraped from the two valves, the incrusta-
tations are chopped away with heavy knives
the shell itself being washed, laid out to drj
and then weighed. A common practice
among some of the old hands was to stand
the oysters on their heel in the hot tropical
sun, and in a short time their lips would
open. A piece of wood about three inches
long would be inserted in the opening, and
the oyster would instantly close on it leav-
ing an open space through which a predatory
finger could seek the lip pearl. The piece
of wood would then be knocked out, and, the
oyster immediately closing its lips, no sign
would indicate that the shell had been
interfered with. The surest safeguard
against pearl thieving was to have three
nationalities on a lugger. If a Malay, for
instance, did anything wrong, a Manila man
or a Jap would be sure to put him away.

“Wang” : “Gippsland’s the place fer things
ter grow,” said Smiler. “They’ve got worms
down there nine feet long. That’ll show
yer w’at th’ soil's like. I wus graftin’ fer
a cocky ’oo left a set of ’arrers lyin’ in a
corner of a paddick ’e’d just put in spuds.
I toT 'im ’e’d better take the ’arrers up to
th’ ’ouse, as they might get pinched; but
’e says they’d be all right w’ere they was.
Birds useter sit on them ’arrers cleanin’
their bills. 'Bout six munce later ’im an’ me
an’ one of ’ees kids goes down to th’ paddick
ter get th’ ’arrers. There ain't none. In
th’ place w’ere they was they’s a tree about
a ’undred feet ’igli, with matted branches.
We’re standin’ there scratchin’ our ’eads,
w’en th’ kid gives a yell. ‘Tliey’s a neagle’s
nest up there,’ ’e says. ‘l’m goin’ up after
it.’ So ’e shins up th’ tree, an’ presently we
’ears ’im yellin’ to us to come up. Up we
scrambles, right to th’ top o’ th’ tree; an’
w’at d’yer think’s there? It ain’t no eagle’s
nest; it's them ’arrers. Some bird cleanin’
its bill must ’a’ dropped a seed, an’ it ’ad
gerryminated an' growed up, an' taken th’
’arrers with it.”

“Biliai” : The fashion of tying up bunches
of bananas in their own leaves (B. 11/8/"27)
is common throughout Papua. Unlike the
Darnley Islanders, the natives treat not
only backward bunches in this manner, but
every bunch as it begins to show signs of
maturity. It is used purely as a protection
against the manuboi or flying-foxes, which
hang in myriads on the trees along the upper
waters of all the rivers, descending in the
late afternoons to ravage the gardens of
the thickly populated coast. First come odd
foxes, then countless hordes, and as darkness
falls the heavy beat of the leathery wings
of late-comers can still be heard. For some
reason the flights always follow the exact
course of the rivers, never cutting across
even an ox-bow curve.

DANNY McSHANE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
High rode the moon when the Stranger came
down the winding path that led
Between the dumps of the duffered patch
right up to the old bough shed;
And it was a tender smile he had as the
door aside he drew,
“God bless you, Danny McShane,” he said,
“and how is it now with you?
“It’s long you have sought in the ridges here
for riches that never came,
It’s hard you have toiled ’neatli the burning
sun—heigh, lad, ’tis a cruel shame.
But I bring you word of a grand new find
where it’s like old times again,
And I’ve come to say there’s a claim re-
served for one named Danny McShane.
“There are mates of yours that are doing
well, but always it’s you they miss.
‘A pity it is,’ I have heard them say, ‘that
Dan isn’t in on this.
He’s pottering round on those ridges yet, no
place for a decent man,
And he’d be the life of the company, and
the joy of us all, would Dan.
“Grand is your talk,” said Danny McShane,
“but, Stranger, afraid am I.
With my old horse poor, and the season bad,
if the stages be long and dry.
It’s true there is nothing hereabout for a
decent man; but yet
Just speak you kindly to all the lads, and
tell them I don’t forget.”
“Now rest you easy, Danny McShane, ’tis
no distance at all,” lie said,
“And well and true has the track been blazed
by the boys who have gone ahead.
And what will I answer, now tell me that,
when I meet with them all again—
The mates who are holding the claim for
you, and they ask ‘Where’s Danny
McShane?’ ”
The moon had set when the Stranger went
up the winding path that led
To the old, old Find that is always new,
from the door of the old bough siied.
A fair wind blew with the chill of dawn,
and the stars were pale and dim,
And Danny, a smile on his tired face, went
slowly along with him.

The automobile is playing an important part in enabling Australian citizens to carry out in

a unique sightseeing motor tour over nearly SIX THOUSAND MILES of rough Australian

was via Adelaide, thence across the Continent to Darwin and back through Central
Queensland and N.S.W. to Melbourne. The trip was an epoch making one and provided
probably the severest test that a touring car and tyres has been put to in this country

and that they lived up to the reputation these tyres have gained for ability to withstand the

There is no doubt “Dunlops” do give extra service and you can be sure
of it when you purchase Dunlop from your Garage.

always proves cheapest in the long run
Some power-users have not yet realised that a reliable engine is always CHEAP
whatever its first cost. There are lots of engines on the market to-day that will give good
service for a year or two and then “crack up” just when you need the power most.
Think how costly it is if your engine holds you up at shearing time, or at milking,
or pumping water for famished stock.
Lister engines are noted, in fact, are world-famous for their reliability. This means
not only an absence of expense due to time lost, but also a minimum for repairs. And the

“Up Top”; While walking through the
gloom of the tropical scrubs one sees flower-
petals upon the countless roots, and yet no
sign of tlu> flower that shed them. In the
Daintree Ranges (N.Q.) some flowers grow
far up amongst the impenetrable foliage.
That is the place where the only chance of
sunlight is found, so nature has evolved
strange beauties that make a home upon the
tops of trees. Again, there arc vines and

between earth and the trees’ branches, seek-
ing neither moist earth nor light, but only
the free space between. It is rare indeed to
And a flower growing upon the earth, for in
the dense jungle the soil is nowhere visible;
it is covered by an inextricably entangled
mat of roots • and rotted vegetation upon
which no unbroken ray of sunlight shines.
Down some of the great gorges of the Dain-
tree Valley I have seen an unusual sort of
creeper carrying grape-like clusters of pure
white flowers, with petals bearing the sug-
gestion of having been moulded in wax. These
flowers seem different from their brethren of
the sun. Gazing at a cluster clinging far
down the walls of a precipice, one gets an
impression of utter stillness and gliostliness.

“E.S.” : It may be true of the present time
that “a 13ft. alligator has yet to he .found"
(B. l/9/’27), but the fossil bones of a
’gator ,‘lOft. long were found on the Darling
Downs of Queensland. To-day Australia has
two crocodiles, but there is no alligator
nearer than China; and the question to be
determined is whether the old pool rulers
came from China or the Chinese saurians
originated in Australia. This so-called new
country is. in fact, a very old country, and
may have been the nursery of numerous ani
mals of the world. The variety of our birds,
for instance, is greater than that of any
other land, and includes the most primitive
and the most highly-developed species. Then
there is the Talgai skull, which also came
from the Darling Downs. When that vast
graveyard and other great fossil beds are
properly explored, many old-world ideas as
to where various forms of life originated
mav be skittled.

“Ilullin-Guffin”: Dossing under a tree
(“Pf'clla,” B. l/9/’27) is certainly not a
sensible custom, unless the tree is very small.
I have a vivid recollection of an evening
many years ago when 1 was travelling, and
heavy rain came on. I pulled my horse
and cart off the road to a tree and pre-
pared to camp under it. .lust then an ex-
perienced man came along with his team.
"What are you doing under that tree, young
feller V” lie ask'd. 1 expla.nod. "Get away,
you your.g fool. S'pose a wind rises and a
limb or the whole tree comes down!” 1
moved. In the morning 1 gathered enough
sticks to boil the billy from a big limb thal
had fallen right over where my cart had
stood.

“Gouger” : The mystery of the “iodoform"
fish, to which Bui.i.kti.n contributors have
referred, has been solved by the repair work
now being done to the submarine cable con-
necting Cape York telegraph-station with
Thursday Island. r i'he men hauling in the
cable have had their hands stained a vivid
yellow by a species of seaweed adhering to
the cable. Some of this weed is spongy, and
on being squeezed squirts out a liquid smell-
insr of concentrated iodoform so strong that
-DID YOU GIVE THE ORDER TO DISMOUNT, SIR?"
rut even rough winds onn drive the odor
completely from flu 1 surf-boat. And you
can't get the vivid stain off with a scrubbing-
brush and sand-soap. Hut nature even
here provid vs compensation. Some portions
of (he cable come up from evidently a lime-
stone ■ bottom, for the cable is encrusted at
times with a gritty white powder. This
stuff cleanses the hands of the gang better
than soap, though it is some time before it
dissolves the yellow from the finger-nails. No
doubt is is through eating this particular
seaweed that fish smell so strongly of iodo-
form.

“Lily-Boale" : Sixteen years ago old Dan
Foster was a regular caller at Enroka
station, near Walg tt (X.S.W.). where I
was then living. lie was always accom-
panied.by his wife. Dan's method of travel-
ling was unique. 11 is round extended from
Walgett. via Coonamble. to Bourke, and he
tramped the distance between the shafts of
a light cart, in which sat his wife perched
on top of their worldly possessions. Dan
once refused an offer of an old horse and a
patehed-up set of harness, explaining that
" 'ors.es are too much trouble, an' take too
much fendin' in the drought, an' you never
know when they may peg out an' leave ye;:
in the lurch.”

“Kayeff”: The balmy breezes which swoop
Nauru are sometimes rather highly flavored
from a quoei; source. Waterspouts are not
uncommon in that latitude, and occasionally
one sweeps across or near to the island.
After twisting into many S-shaped curves,
the marine willy-willy breaks, and often
causes a local shower. Saltwater showers
from this source are tolerated, but the island-
er.; arc annoyed when if rains small fish.
Several times this has happened, the whirl-
ing waterspout having sucked up a school of
small fry and discharged it over the land-
scape. After the tropical sun has poured
down on the scattered fish for a day or two
the place smells like Billingsgate.

“Wandi": A frequent source of trouble
among blacks is the inconstant spouse who
runs' away with another bloke. 1 knew one
who dragged a hush after her wherever she
went, never daring to leave her tracks any-
where in case the deserted husband should
come across them. Even when far from his
haunts she trailed that covering branch, or
wore hoots. Tracks did not matter, pro-
vided they were not made by her naked feet,
the imprint of which the ex-hubby could
distinguish from that of any other member
of the tribe. She was often the only shod
person in a wandering mob. Several times
I met her trudging along in heavy bluchers
that were an immense handicap to her, but
they were life-savers.

“Ti Tree": I quite agree with “Pfclla"
(B. 4/S/'27) when lie says that “Adamas-
cus” has never seen a goanna descend from
a tree, because the reptiles always drop
instead of scrambling down the trunk. If
"Adamasons" likes to stroll along tbo ban’
of ;i creek in the go. country, lie'll hear a
continual splash, splash, as the brutes dive
in from overhanging brandies. A goanna
isn't particular about his place of refuge as
long as it's safe, and if there’s water handier
than a tree lie'll be cooling his hide before
you could say Jack Robinson. One day my
kelpie got between a little go. and the creek
and thought he had him on toast, but the
beggar doubled up and down, tying the
dog in knots and getting closer to the water
at every turn. Finally he slipped in with
a derisive splash, leaving the kelpie—a good
sheepdog-—barking disconsolately on the
bank. A really big goanna isn’t scared of
the best dog on earth, or a man either for
that matter. I saw a monster one day,
about the size of a young crocodile and as
thick in the skin, sunning himself on a corner
post after- clearing out all the rabbit-traps
in the neighborhood. 1 rode up and cracked
him with the whip. The go., instead of
treeing, promptly reared up and spat, and the
pony went for its life.

“Ohlora Form”: A squatter in the Bur-
rowa (N.N.W.) district, wishing to lay
emphasis on the necessity for closing gates,
burst into verse. 11 is effusion, attached to
the gates on his property, road
Jf you're corning in the morning, or if you're coining
late.
Wo would wish you’d have (he kindness to securely
shut the gate.
We were summoned once for rabbits, it's proceedings
that we hate;
We’ll be had up next for-murder if you do not shut
this gate.

“FI Mnyinero”: Evidently “Prop” (B.
l/il/'JT) lias not met the real horizontal
scrub: of the Specks West Coast. To talk of
forcing a passage through it is folly; the
only way to cross is by walking on top of
it. IT* or 20 feet above the ground. If you
strike a thin patch you fall through, and
that's your funeral.
:i: * *
“TJp North": So far as my wanderings
have shown me, some abo, tribes inhabiting
the Fingerpoini i N.Q.) are the only binghis
who mummify their dead. Through the
glasses I one day noticed within a distant
swam]) a tall dead tree smoking like a chim-
ney. I waded for miles through lily-covered
water, and found a piccaninny, half-way up
the smoke funnel, upon a support of sticks.
An invisible sentry warned me off. Three
months later I met that piccaninny, restored
to its mother’s gunyah. It was hard as a
board. The secret being out, I was shown
the process, though necessarily at a distance.
A dead man was disembowelled, then hung
in a tree and sun-cooked for a fortnight.
This got rid of the fatty matter which
arrests mummification. A too-sensitive nose
impelled me to miss the next operation.
Eventually the carcase was strung in a hol-
low tree and smoked. They smoke the
bodies for a long period, and after a change
to “now” country rosmoke them lightly.
They proudly handed mo a womera to test
one fellow's fitness, and I thumped him hard.
It was like hanging a hollow log.
SONG OF GATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our bushland bards have sung of roads out
where the world is wide,
And through the great grey plain at dusk
the ghostly horsemen lade ;
They’ve sung of flooded rivers, and the with-
'ring clutch of drought,
They’ve sung the songs of pioneers whose
paths led further out.
But all our bards forgot one theme that still
for song awaits;
And so this newest song I sing, a song of
Bushland Gates!
Breaking gates and squeaking gates along
the western roads ;
Across the homestead paddocks the endless
opening goads;
I busty gates and rusty gates, all muddy when
it rains—
A hundred gates you open on those tracks
across the plains.
Of gum and wattle, waratah, our bards have
often sung;
They’ve rhymed of wan white ghostly trees
by settlers’ axes rung;
’They’ve tuned their lyres and beefed a lay
of glorious ripening wheat;
They’ve sung sad lays of swagaien lost, in
metres trim and neat;
From love to hate, all subjects known have
earned them lineage rates.
But all. our poets clean forgot this theme of
Bushland Gates!
Smallest gates and tallest gales—oh down
you get at each.
Your plunging brumby breaks away while
for the catch you reach. . . .
When fed-up buslnnen dream of Heaven it
makes their eyes dilate
To think St. Peter's waiting -yes! lie's
waiting by a GATE!

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
WOOL CLASSING FOR THE COCKY.
“Trepex”: A small woolgrower—or any
other, for that matter —begins to class his
wool when he stocks up his paddocks. If he
relies on small job lots of sheep, picked up
cheaply, as he imagines, from here, there
and everywhere, he lets himself in for a
mixture of wool which, at the best, can
only be helped along by makeshifts. With
an even line of sheep, on the other hand, and
an occasional judicious culling of his flocks,
all his wool will be of one geixeral character.
Two or three obvious main lines will be all
the classes he needs, with perhaps a few
bales of oddments.
It is in the handling of oddments that he
most often goes astray, making bales of
hideous and unprofitable mixtures rather
than invest four or five bob in a pack for a
lightweight bale of straight quality. If a
man has to cull out a few odd fleeces for
one reason and another, the whole of which
will not make up a “big” lot, it would be
better to make two fairly straight bales
rather than one mixture. One does not
like to see too many “star” lots in a clip,
and our local markets are becoming over-
burdened with them ; but two even lots are
less work and more profit to everyone except
the speculator who trades on inefficient work-
manship.
An even line of sheep in the paddocks
will make fewer “star” lots than the most
judicious classing or blending of wool in
the shed. Even the man who merely keeps
a few jumbucks to feed off his crop will find
it will pay him to keep good ones while
he is about it. With sheep at their pre-
sent price and in their present quantity, there
is no reason why he shouldn’t have them
either. If he is a dealer and thinks he
can make more money by buying and selling
the brutes, that is his affair, but he can’t
expect to get an even wool clip off a mixed
flock, as so many men think they can do. I
have seen too many desolate failures to have
any patience with the delusion.
FORAGE PROBLEMS.
“Hoki Mut”: “GG6’s” experience in
regard to sheep refusing to forage for them-
selves after a spell of hand-feeding (B.
l/9/’27) can apply only to country on
which dry feed alone remains. In this dis-
trict (Griffith, N.S.W.) our difficulties dur-
ing the dry autumn and winter have been
accentuated by the reverse of the position
outlined by “GG6”; but, of course, the
Riverina has had regular falls of rain, small
both individually and in the aggregate, and
of no value, yet sufficient to bring after each
fall a green “pick.” Faced with these cir-
cumstances. and despite experimental altera-
tions in the diet, the sheep have left the
artificial fodders in favor of the natural
grasses, which, being so short and lacking
in nutriment, have caused a falling off in
condition. In a very few days the “shoot”
disappears, and the sheep are forced to
return to the hand-distributed fodders, when
their condition begins to improve.
PROFITABLE PIT ENSILAGE.
“Ted R.”: Last spring, Scott Bros., of
Currabubula (N.S.W.). had an old culti-
vation paddock which grew a crop of wild
oats, in places 6ft. high. It was put into
pits, 400 tons of it, at a cost of 3s. 6d. a
ton, including cutting, carting and filling
and pit-digging. To-day the fodder is worth
£5 a ton and is freely saleable at the price.
“STAR” LOTS OF WOOL.
“L. Y. Remos”: My experience with “star”
lots at the Sydney wool sales may be *of
interest. It was early in the war and before
Bawra was thought of that I was much dis-
gusted to get a return from my agents show-
ing sid. per lb. for my three bales of beauti-
fully clean fine merino wool of even texture,
whereas a neighbor who had sent down about
a dozen bales averaged 9-|d. per lb., although
the quality was not so fine nor so even as
mine. Inquiry brought the reply that as
mine was a “star” lot there was no com-
petition, hence the low price realised.
My disgust was heightened when I re-
ceived from my agents a return showing that
three chaff-bags of my bellies, pieces and
locks, which had by some chance miscarried
on the railway and so did not reach the
saleroom with the three bales of fleece, had
brought 1 Old. per lb. at the next fortnightly
sale. Think of it! Clean, bright fleece,
5?d.; bellies and pieces and locks from the
same sheep, KHd. Do you wonder that I
made insistent inquiries when next I was
down in Sydney? My agents assured me
that they were not to blame. There was no
competition for “star" lots, which were
inspected by the buyers and parcelled
between them on the floor of the warehouse
where they were displayed before the sale.
In the sale-room there would be only one
offer for each “star” lot, and it would be
knocked down to the bidder at his own price.
I don’t know whether things are managed
any better for the small wool-man now, but
I do know that when I sent my next lot of
wool down to Sydney it was done through
another channel and arranged so that it was
not sold as a “stai'” lot.
THE STRAINING-POST.
“Dongo”: I have been fencing for 2ft
years, but cannot agree with “Allambee’s”
theory (B. 25/8/’27) that a straining-post
with the strut let into it at a point one-
third of the way from the top will hold
in the ground better than one with the strut
nearer the top. A standard four-wire stock-
fence is: Posts 6ft., 2ft. in ground, bottom
wire 17in. from ground, 9in. to next wire,
lOin. to next, llin. to top. and a further
4in. to top of post. “Allambee’s” strut
would be 3ft. 2in. from the ground midway
between bottom and second wires, with the
top wire lGin. above and exorcising a major
pull not sufficiently counteracted by tin;
lower wires. Fencers who lit struts anywhere
but close under the top wire generally get
short shrift from property-owners.
WATCH THE HORSE FODDER.
“Coola” : A farmer who uses horses finds
frequently that his land becomes “dirty”
on account of his team being fed on inferior
chaff or hay. Any chaff containing black
oats or barley, the former in particular, is
unsafe to use, as once a paddock has been
“salted” with black oats it is practically
spoiled for wheat-growing. The seed has
been known to lie unharmed for years in the
soil. A man never knows when it is got
rid of, and when it grows in a crop the seed
matures and falls before the rest of the
crop is stripped, thus providing another
year’s seed of rubbish. If tin; crop is cut
for hay the oats are there ready to spoil the
hay and to be deposited back upon the land
by the horses.
Where inferior wheaten hay is used as
feed the spores of disease are deposited again
upon the soil. This explains why smut is
often seen in wheat after the seed has been
carefully treated before sowing.
MIXING FERTILISERS.
“M.H.”: The lack of natural stable or
farmyard manures is often the excuse for
farmers mixing fertilisers, but it is always
risky. Here are fertilisers which should not
be combined, because the action of one coun-
teracts the other: Garden lime and sulphate
of ammonia; superphosphate and nitrate of
soda; nitrate of lime and super, of lime;
basic slag and sulphate of ammonia. Fer-
tilisers which can be mixed are sulphate of
ammonia and superphosphate; sulphate of
potash and nitrate of soda ; nitrate of pot-
ash and sulphate of ammonia; superphos-
phate of lime and sulphate of potash.
RULES OF MUSTERING.
“Te Hipi”: Here are a few elementary
rules of mustering that apply everywhere:
Have good dogs to start with; if you
haven’t you will never get a clean muster
and you will knock the sheep about.
Start early, before the sheep have fed;
they travel better then.
Work quietly. Yelling at the dogs and
leaping on your hat in a rage when they
won’t work isn’t good for the dogs—or the
lid. If the sheep are mustered quietly at
the start they will draw along easily in a
mob. If you start ’em with a rattle and a
bang the stronger ones get a lead and the
weaker have to be continually forced, which
does them no good, takes longer and means
harder work for dog and man.
Keep the dogs off the sheep; the quiet
dog, well away from the sheep, does the job
and doesn’t hurt the sheep like the rough-
house close worker.
Let the sheen go easily until you have
the paddock mustered. Force them then
if you like.
LIFTING SHEEP.
“Tom T.” : “Anthony Gloster’s" method of
handling fallen sheep by lifting them up by
the skin on the back is cruel, and bruises
the carcases. The best method is to stand
well over the sheep and grip the wool low
down on each side of the belly, lifting the
sheep bodily. If it refuses to respond and
sulks, leave it alone for 10 minutes, and in
nine cases out of ten it will get up without
assistance.
WOOLPACK TESTS.
“To Hipi”: M.L. Slieepbreeders’ Federa-
tion has been testing the new woolpacks
and doesn’t like ’em. The proposed jute
pack, made from specially prepared fibre,
proved too light to stand rough usage, being
easily torn by hooks. The woollen pack was
a failure too, losing its shape badly and
being of too open a weave for repairs after
cutting open for samples.
Bradford, however, has not yet despaired
of finding a substitute for the old goods. It
might be worth while experimenting with
M. flax (Phormium tenax). When pro-
perly dressed, this flax can be woven into
a fairly fine cloth. (The .Taps make arti-
ficial silk from the best of it.) So the weaving
of a fairly coarse pack that wouldn’t, shred
off into the wool like jute should be practic-
able.
Has anyone tried singeing the libres of
the present pack? That might help to keep
the stuff out of the wool.
SHEEP AND WHEAT.
“Glenfield”: “Tritici” (B. 25/8/’27) is
right when he advocates turning sheep on to
the forward wheat crops to eat them back,
but it should only be done when there liaS
been a good rainfall. There are many new
settlers in my district (n.-w. Malleej just
going in for sheep who might overlook that
point. In six years out of seven eating
off would be injurious to the crops in our
country of light rainfall. We require as
much early growth as we can get, hence
the practice of early sowing. When the
ground is well covered with stooling crops,
evaporation is lessened in the hot days of
drying winds. Even in the odd year when
eating off would be beneficial, we are in a
state of uncertainty, as the tap may be
turned off abruptly.
CARPET GRASS.
“RXB”: Carpet grass, alias Paspalum
compressum, deserves a little publicity. It
is a variety that seems to prefer every form
of hardship to an inch of rain, and it will
thrive in any class of soil, the poorer the
better. It is a perennial running variety,
and, rooting from the joints, it will quickly
cover the land with a mass of verdure up to
ten inches in height, which is relished by all
classes of stock. It is practically drought-
resistant, and is especially valuable in poor
sandy soils, and does not object if these
are strongly saline. It will thrive equally
well on forest ridges where other grasses
cannot establish themselves. It will eradi-
cate bracken and other rubbish by suffoca-
tion ; and, unlike Paspalum dilatatum,
which is proving itself as much a curse as a
blessing in lots of ways, it can be easily
eradicated by simply ploughing it in before
it seeds. It is worth a trial, and a good many
N. 8. Wales North Coast cockies can now
supply seed.
WOOL-GROWING FOR PLANTERS.
“Hinchinbrook”: Many of the numerous
small islands dotted along the North Queens-
land coast have been carrying sheep success-
fully for years past. Now a Northern resi-
dent named Langford is going to combine
sheep-raising and copra-growing on Shaw
Island, between Townsville and Cairns, and
is to start on his dual-purpose enterprise at
once. The custom on cocoanut plantations
has been to employ cattle to keep down the
grass, and other growth till the palms are
strong enough to keep their own ground clear,
and the combination has proved a success.
But sheep, which are much closer feeders and
themselves give quicker returns, seem prefer-
able where they can be run successfully,
which is not the case in many of the Western
Pacific Islands. Nevertheless, in some parts,
such as the New Hebrides, it has been found
practicable to grow decent wool on cocoa-
nut-plantations. The North Queensland ven-
ture seems to have possibilities. Wool-
growing has already been a proved success
on the coastal islands, and cocoanut plant-
ing for copra is being taken up rapidly all
along the coast. No better paying interim
crop than wool, while the cocoanut palms are
reaching maturity, can be imagined, and re-
turns would be more certain and more profit-
able than from peanuts and the many other
crops on which the planter depends to carry
him over till the palms are in profitable
bearing.
,CHILLED BEEF.
“Dalgonally”: The shipment of chilled
beef, as distinguished from frozen, from Aus-
tralia to England, continues to progress,
though only in a modest fashion. The Port
Huon sailed from Brisbane recently with
the fourth consignment, which brings the
total number of quarters landed in Britain
by the experimenting company to 1400. In
spite of the long carriage, the meat in the
earlier shipments has arrived at Smithfield
in first-class condition, and has realised
within a fraction of a penny of the prices
given for prime chilled Argentine. It has
now been practically decided to fit up a
number of ships with the special chilling
apparatus to carry meat not only to Britain
but to European, American and even Eastern
ports, if the demand arises. In view of the
present moribund condition of the Australian
beef-export industry, the time seems about
ripe to tackle the chilled-meat industry on
a more extensive scale.
A KNOCK FOR THE MERINO.
“FY7”: The patriotic and pigheaded per-
sons who decline to believe that the prestige
of Australian merino wool is being seriously
threatened by the South African product will
be aroused to fresh frenzy by the allegations
of Prof. Barker, of Leeds Uni., famous for
his researches into causes of defects in
fabrics. He was unkind enough to tell the
British Association for the Advancement of
Science the other day that he doubted
whether one-eightli of the Australian merino
clip was really pure merino. The original
merino of Australia showed fibre of con-
siderably less diameter than that of to-day.
This, in his opinion, resulted not only from
selection within the merino breed, but by
crossing with such breeds as Lincolns and
Leicesters. In view of the great and rising
demand for fine wool yarns and fabrics he
thought this was a serious matter for Aus-
tralian growers. It also provided, he said,
an opportunity for South African growers,
who were bidding fair to become a great
factor in the world’s fine wool supply.
HINTS FOR THE FARM WORKSHOP.
“Tractor Mac” : Farmers have to tackle a
fair amount of carpentry and rough metal
work, but they don't as a rule know how
to treat the tools they work with.
Not one farmer in a hundred gets the same
service from a file as an engineer would.
Files are allowed to lie about, collecting
grease and dust, until they are clogged up
and useless, or jumbled together in the same
box, where just rubbing together takes more
out of them than an hour’s work. The
proper way to treat a new file is to rub it
with chalk or soft charcoal, which prevents
filings from sticking between the teeth, and
to clean it every time it is used with a
sixpenny wire file-brush. Then, if hung up
in a rack where it can’t rub against other
files, its life will be trebled.
Another much-abused tool is the hand-
saw. It is allowed to' become' dull and
rusty, with the result that it jambs in the
wood and becomes buckled and ruined. Few
cockies can sharpen and set a saw, chiefly
because they try to file the front of the teeth
to sharp edges, instead of filing the back of
the teeth to make sharp points on top.
Those who can’t set and sharpen their saws
ought to get the job done properly by the
nearest carpenter. He won’t charge much.
It is quite common, too, to see the wooden
planes in a farm workshop perishing and
cracking to pieces for want of a little oil
rubbed on them.
TWIN CALVES.
“Dongle”: “Max” (B. 11/8/’27) may be
interested to learn of the performance put
up by a family of Guernsey cattle on the
Government farm at Lismore (N.S.W.). A
cow, Hope of Wollongbar, produced in three
periods of lactation an average of 10001 b.
of butter fat, constituting a world’s record
for the breed. Hope dropped twin heifer
calves. Honor and Trust. Both these heifers
turned out to be champion show cows and
producers. The third generation also had
twins, and a heifer of the third generation
is shaping to eclipse even the old grand-
mother's record. However. “Max” can take
it for granted that in this particular case
the calves were looked after and were a
perfect pair of heifers.
POTATO GROWING IN QUEENSLAND.
“V.H.R.”: If a seven-ton-to-the-acre crop
is “Ikey Ironbark’s” (B. 11/8/’27) only
argument for more spud-growing in Queens-
land, he will not convince many practical
people. “Bad Australian” sums up the posi-
tion (B. 8/9/’27) when he suggests that
Tasmanian cockies might just as well talk
about taking up sugar growing. At Circular
Head it is not uncommon to get a crop of
25 tons to the acre in the swamp districts,
and a farmer who does not get an average of
10 tons thinks he is hard done by. I think
the Queenslanders had better stick to sugar-
cane and bananas!
COW TESTING.
“Titun” : The herd-testing associations are
doing great work in Vic. They are spring-
ing up like mushrooms wherever dairymen
can band together to pay the wages of a

The Man on the Land
tester. This is generally done by means of
a registration-fee for every cow in the herd,
together with a general subscription. The
tester gets from £2OO to £250 p.a., some-
times with keep. It isn’t very hard to
get a tester’s certificate. The only weak
point in the scheme is that there’s nothing
to stop the culls from a herd being sold as
first-class milkers, but there is talk of a
law to make it compulsory to produce a
test-card in the sale ring.
THE BEST ORCHARD SOIL.
“Boronia” : The apple-growers of Groper-
land are beginning to realise that soil qual-
ity plays an important part in determining
the appearance and keeping qualities of their
product. Some years ago this aspect of the
matter was not considered; but nowadays
the intending planter who knows what he is
about selects his ground with great care.
Heavy clay soils afford longer tree-life, but
the apples grown there are comparatively
poor keepers and are inferior in appearance.
Those produced on light, dry land look well
and keep well, but are on the small side.
During 10 years’ experience as a Westralian
orchardist I have found that the best apple—
—flavoi’, size, keeping qualities and appear-
ance considered —is grown on a sandy soil
having an easterly aspect and possessing a
friable clay subsoil not deeper than two feet
from the surface.
EXCHANGE OF GRAZING AREAS.
“Coola”: Sheep require variety in their
food, and sickness among them is often
traced to the sameness of diet over long
periods. On small holdings there is little
scope for variety in plants, and the sheep
destroy their favorite foods by nipping each
shoot as it appears. Thus myall and other
trees are prevented from growing at all, and
saltbush is sometimes destroyed root and
branch.
To get over the difficulty the only way is
to change the sheep frequently. This means
a lot of work, and is not always profitable,
hut it prevents disease. Relatives and
friends could easily exchange flocks tem-
porarily, and would be glad to do so if they
understood the value of change to the jum-
bucks’ health. For ewes this change is
especially beneficial and they produce better
lambs when their range is less restricted.
Flocks oil small holdings could be kept on
a jiar with those which roam over wide
stretches of country by the exchange plan.
THE MARSHMALLOW.
“Homfrey Beale” : One of the curses of the
sheepbreed'er in parts favorable to its
growth is the marshmallow. Sheep born and
reared on it lose their stamina —in fact,
they never have much to lose. If travelled
more than two or three miles they develop
a sort of staggers. Then they hump, and
ultimately lie down. One station in Western
N.S.W. is practically all marshmallow land,
and great trouble is experienced in getting
the sheep bred on it to market. Recently
a mob of 800 _ “humped” after going just
short of five miles, and after vain attempts
to get them to move had to be transported
in motor-lorries to the trucking yards.
No means of completely combating the
nuisance is known. Continuous cutting
helps; each crop is less potent than its pre-
decessor.
It is possible to partially immunise sheep
against the plant. If ewes from marsh-
mallow land are removed about a month
befoi-e lambing to clean country and kept
there till the progeny is weaned, the sheep
so raised will have a greater resistance to
the plant’s effects than those born and
reared on marshmallow land. Also, if the
process is repeated with their progeny and
continued through about four to five genera-
tions, almost absolute immunity will result.
BLACKBERRY EXTERMINATION.
“Te Ilipi”: I wouldn’t recommend the
method of ridding a farm of blackberry
advised by “Gundy” (B. 25/S/’27). The
job of hoeing out the pest would be much
too costly unless one could import some
Chinese cheap labor. But goats will do the
work even more cheaply than Chinks. If
possible slash down and burn the blackberry
before turning Bill in. He will finish the
job quicker then, but he will eventually
get rid of it even if not cut down. The
paddocks should be fairly small so that you
can concentrate the goats on each in turn.
Keep an eye open for footrot. Goats on wet
country are just as liable to get the disease
as sheep. The same methods of prevention
and cure can be used as in the case of sheep.
IN DEFENCE OF THE MANDARIN.
“Hop Scrub”: In his strictures on the
mandarin (B. l/9/’27) “XSA” must refer
only to N.S.W. Mandarin prices taken from
a current Brisbane daily read : Glens 18s. to
245. per case; Scarlets, Emperors and Wara-
tahs the same ; King of Siam 2s. less; and
best navels only 15s. to 20s. Brown spot,
though a pest of the passion fruit on Tam-
bourine, is not a serious menace to the man-
darin in Queensland experience. As to frosts,
Scarlets, Waratahs and Kings stand up to
such frosts as do occur, quite as well as or
better than oranges. Locally the mandarin
is always likely to be in demand —it’s easier
to peel and eat for one thing, also Queensland
experiences a golden flood of navels and
Valencias from the south, and local growers
are inclined to stick to the mandarin and get
in early with such oranges as Siletta and
Sabina.
HONEY STANDARDS.
“Orn” : I don’t think much of the argu-
ments of “Larrapinta” (B. 25/8/’27) in
support of cutting down the marks for flavor
in grading honey to 25 p.c. He states that
England wants a light-colored honey. Eng-
lish honey, derived largely from clover, is
usually light-colored and seldom of poor
flavor; hence the first prejudice is in favor
of light-colored honey, as against the poor-
quality honey from the West Indies and else-
where, which is usually dark. But the Eng-
lishman doesn’t rely wholly on color;
heather honey, which is darker colored,
ranks with the best and commands the
top prices. Moreover, there is quite
a considerable proportion of honey pro-
duced in Australia so poor that I would
not feed it to a hive of drones, and some of
it is water-white. I have no personal inter-
est, since my honey is produced in Tassy,
but I think the N.S.W. beekeepers are mak-
ing a fatal mistake in monkeying with the
flavor standard. That I am not alone is
shown by the fact that in the W.A. stan-
dard just published 35 p.c. is allotted to
flavor.
CATS AS LAMB-KILLERS.
“Lily-Beale”: Reynard cannot always be
blamed for shortages among lambs. When
I was boundary riding on Beanbali station
(Coonamble, N.S.W.) young lambs were
often found dead in the paddocks, in most
instances with their throats torn. The
dogs got the blame and orders were given
for all employees’ mongs to be chained up at
nightfall. But the lambs still suffered.
Riding home one evening a frightened bleat-
ing made me canter over into a corner of a
paddock, where I discovered about 500 ewes
and lambs huddled together, while two cats
worried a lamb on the edge of the mob.
After that we did some pussy-hunting and
the killings stopped. The cats appeared to
be domestic animals gone bush.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Louden”: “Is fistula hereditary in
horses?” asks “Yufu” (B. 28/7/'27). No.
Veterinary-Surgeon Robson, of Perth, has
discovered that it is caused by a flesh-colored
threadlike worm. How it gets into the
system has yet to be determined.
“V.H.R.”: Denzel Little, well known
Tassy breeder of Border-Leicester sheep,
claims that he owes the lives of several
prize ewes to whisky. A short time back
about a dozen of the animals fell ill. lie
consulted a vet., who diagnosed livei* trouble ;
but the prescribed treatment failed. Little
decided then to give whisky a trial, a table-
spoonful every two hours. All the ewes so
treated recovered, while one which was not
given any whisky died.
“Barmac”: If a quarter or third of a tea-
spoonful of baking-powder is placed right
in the dingo bait with the strychnine, so
that the dog can swallow it without tasting
it, the body will be found well within a
75-yard radius. But keep your tame dogs
away. The first fit is the last.
“Mulga Mac”: I can tell “Con Drew” a
better way to pick up a bull’s track. The
bull is the only one of the cattle family that
treads more heavily on the outside half of the
hind feet. The characteristic is very marked.
“Saaedi”: After dipping, it is advisable to
dry sheep in the shade before driving them
any distance. If they :are driven hard, par-
ticularly on a hot day, just after dipping,
the wool is likely to show a “break” later
on. Cool, cloudy weather is ideal for dipping;
on the other hand, if rain falls on the freshly-
treated sheep, the effect of the dipping is
greatly diminished.
“Anthony Gloster”: Dipping time will
soon be here, and while you are putting
the sheep through don’t neglect Fido, par-
ticularly if he is a long-haired collie. One
quick souse in the dip will settle his fleas
for a while and improve his coat immensely.
If the dog is tractable, it is better to remove
his collar, under which the fleas generally
congregate. Don’t let him be in more than
a few seconds. A dog’s pores are quick to
take in poisons.
“Anthony Gloster”: Cows are faddy crea-
tures and should always be milked in the
same order. Nothing puts Strawberry out
of her stride like seeing Dolly get into
the bail before her and herself being hustled
in instead of Topsy, if she has got used to
things being otherwise. Half the shortage
of milk that occurs when the milker is
changed is due to the routine being upset.
“Titun” : Experiments conducted by J. T.
Ramsay, Vic. potato expert, have shown that
best results can be obtained on most classes
of land by using manure in the proportion
of 6cwt. of super, to fewt. of sulphate of
ammonia to the acre. The best method of
applying this dressing is at sowing time,
placing it in the same furrow as that in
which the seed is placed. The fertiliser is
then readily available when growth com-
mences. and so the formation of tubers con-
tinues steadily without any check while the
plant is seeking out supplies of food.
“Barmac” : Dry. common salt is the hand-
iest cure for strychnine poisoning. A hand-
ful forced down a tyke’s throat usually effects
a cure.
“Mora”: The simplest and most effec-
tive remedy for scab in sheep is an old one,
and consists of 11b. quicksilver, Mb. Venice
turpentine, Ipt. oil of turpentine and 41b.
hog’s lard. Mix thoroughly, making certain
that the quicksilver is properly incorporated.
The services of a chemist should be obtained
if possible. Apply as follows: Beginning at
the head of the sheep and proceeding from
between the ears, along the back to the tail,
divide the wool into a furrow, till the skin
can be touched, and as the furrow is made
draw your finger, dipped in the ointment,
along the bottom of it. whore it will leave
a blue stain on the skin and adjoining wool.
From this furrow others must be drawn
down the shoulders and thighs to the legs,
as far as they are woolly. If the animal is
much infected, draw another furrow on each
side parallel with that on the back, and one
down each side between the hind and fore
legs. Immediately after the dressing the
sheep can be turned in with the mob, without.
any risk of contagion. The blue stain on the
wool will come out in the scoux'ing. It takes
only two or three days for this application to
effect a complete cure.
“E.W.”: Hens become egg-bound some-
times through 'lack of grit and sometimes
through too much green feed in cold weather.
In the first stages inject a small quantity
of olive oil into the vent and then hold the
fowl over a vessel of boiling water to steam
the lower portions of the body. This will
often cause the egg to come away natu-
rally. Only as a last resource break the
egg in the bird, and then see that all the
small shell particles are removed. The treat-
ment may cause the vent to project. In
that case bathe the affected part with warm
water, apply carbolised vaseline and gently
push the projecting part back into place.
A tonic of Parrish’s food or a handful of
rape-seed will help the bird, which should be
kept away from the others until she is
normal again.

KITTY CLIVE.
THE NOBLE BUSHRANGER.
“Hands up, Horace Hartache, or we
fire!”
But Horace did not hands up. _ Instead,
as lie heard the click of his Enemies’ triggers,
he through himself Prone on his liorse’s
hack; and the two ruffins Bit the Dust.
Their own precautions had been their
Undoing. In fear of the dreaded Moonlite
they had placed themselves one on each side
of him before they Dared challenge him.
They both fired together; but as Our Hero
ducked, their bullets flew harmlessly over
his head, and killed each other.
Thus Our Hero was responsible for the
Doth of two of the miscreats he had Sworn
to Exterminate.
He, too, was a bushranger ; but he was not
a bad bushranger like the members of
Delaney's gang. No. Only tin Idol Rich
hated and feared him, for from them lie stole,
but lie gave to the pore. An unfair sum-
mons for keeping an unregistered dog had
driven him to a life of Crime. The policeman
who had delivered tli e summons bruttaly
kicked the dog because it had bitten him,
whereupon Our Hero, in his just anger, Shot
him Dead. After that the Law was against
him, so lie was made a Bushranger by fours.
But the beautiful Squatter's Daughter
knew he was not a bad man, although her
father was straingly prejudiced against him.
No; did she not remember how when the.
Gang led by Delaney had set fire to the Sett-
ler's Cottage lie had ridden Ferelessly back-
ward and foreward to the creek, a mile away,
bringing the buckets of water with which he
eventurally Subdued the Pierce Plames. He
may have killed some pepple in the course of
his business, but it was well known that he
did everything for the Best.
So when her father and the Misterus
Stranger who was visiting his station were
caught in the Toils of the Delaney Gang, it
was to Horace Hartache, popularly known
as Moonlite, that she had gone for help.
Nor did he Fale her. Already two of the
Gang are Dead; they had been placed as
Sentries by the others.
Our Hero rode on, to be greeted by a
fussilade of bullets as he approached. The
ruffins were standing by a fire near a tree
to which their Unhappy Victims were bound.
It was obvious by the piled-up wood around
their Victims Feet that they intended to
burn them to Death. But they were dis-
tracted from their Fell Purpose
by Our Hero’s arrival, and with
a Dred Cry of “Moonlite!” they
opened fire.
But Our Hero, instead of rid-
ing straight at them, began to
circle round them at terrifie
speed, so that their bullets
missed him, and the bushrangers,
turning rapidly round and round
to get a shot at him, grew con-
fused and dizey. As he sped
round, lie fired, but it was not
at tne bushrangers but at the
ropes binding the Hapless
Squatter and his Friend.
Although they knew he was a
dedly shot they may have been
frightened ; the bullets, however,
merely cut the ropes that bound
them, without harming them.
Just as the last Strand was cut
the bushrangers, dizey with
turning round, fell to the
ground. It was easy for the
released men to take their guns
and make them prisoners. All
but two, who, less dizey than
the rest, made off and dashed
into the bush.
“Surrender in the name of the
Law, Horace Hartache, known
as Moonlite,” cried a harsh
voice, just as the men he had
saved were thanking him.
But quickly Our Hero turned and covered
the two policemen who had appeared on the
seen with his gun. Their hands went up.
“These you know as Sergeant Grady and
Constable Burns,” said our hero, “but they
are also Delaney and his left-tenant, Gordon.
As police they have persecuted me because
they know I am not an evil bushranger like
them.”
Prom the way they turned pale it was seen
that this was the Truth.
“Arrest them both, for you are the sergent
now!” said the Misterus Stranger. “You
are given a free pardon and I will see you
get a further Howard. You may have killed
popple, but they were all wicked popple; so
that’s all right.”
“But who are you, then?” said the Squat-
ter’s daughter, who had ridden up whilst he
spoke.
“Governor Macquarie!” he answered with
a cortly bow.
NO NUDITY NECESSARY.
“Listen. Should I put on a dinner-frock for
the bridge party to-night?”
“Oh no. At those affairs you’re only sup-
posed to show your hand.”
When lie seel that, one look at his stern, blew
eyes convinced them that it was lie.
Afterwards, being very popular, Our Hero
went into Parlyment. Other bushrangers
have gone into Parlyment, but none were
as popular as he was.

The Triumph of Pifton.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“T’VE had enough. I won't put up with
J it any longer. I'm fed up!"
Mr. Pifton had just staggered into
the tram, and, having deposited an immense
load of parcels on the seat opposite, stared
fiercely round him as he uttered his indig-
nant protest. It was not always possible to
reveal himself fully to the mysterious person
whom he often addressed. Who this person
was must remain a mystery. He may have
been Mr. Pifton’s inner self. He may have
been some compassionate and helpful soul
who had taken refuge in Mr. Pifton’s nervous
and irritable little body. At all events, this
other person, whoever he was, was’ a perfect
gentleman. He had marvellous perception
and a rare sense of justice. He never inter-
rupted, nor did lie ever talk back, yet his
invariably silent and entire agreement was
in- no sense a weakness. He was ever the
confidant and believing friend, unsuspicious,
positively ingenuous at times, and could
always be depended upon to arrive simultane-
ously at the same conclusions as Mr. Pifton
and' to share Mr. Pifton’s opinions and
suppressed wrath.
“Of course,” continued Mr. Pifton, mop-
ping his brow, “you know what my wife s
like. She’s a peculiar woman. She’s fond
of me, I’ve no reason to doubt that, and it
is only fair to her to admit that she is a
capable wife, besides being an attractive
one. But she is so self-willed, so domineer-
ing. I know, of course, that Emma is quite
a well-meaning woman, but No, I refuse
to put up Avith it any longer ! I’m fed up!
I'm going to be master in my own house!”
Mr. Pifton’s eyes brightened and the
thought, growing swiftly, took entire posses-
sion of him. The recollection of all that he
had endured lashed him into a fury. “What
am I, anyway?” he demanded. "A man?
An idiot! A colossal idiot! She’ll think a
dashed sight more of me, too. Yes, I must
be firm with her. Even ruthless. I'll
Emma, come here! What do I want you
for? Never mind what I want you for!
Come here at once! Now, look here, Emma,
Ave may as Avell understand each other once
and for all. Hitherto, for the sake of peace
and quietness, I’ve done a great many things
that no self-respecting man would do. But
I’m fed up! I refuse to put up Avith it any
longer! The kind of lift' you like doesn’t
suit me! It’s too monotonous! For the
future, when you want any shopping done,
you can do it yourself. I’m not going to
carry any more parcels. I'm sick of being a
packhorse. I’ve been a drudge in this dull
hole of a suburb long enough. As for your
buying, me any more clothes of any descrip-
tion and cutting my hair, I won’t have it.
I won’t have it! Life with me is going
to-be different! Entirely different! I’m
going to run things to suit myself! I’m
going to be master in my own house ! Master !
Understand ?”
The arrival of the tram at Mr. Pifton's
street cut short his ultimatum. He would
have needed at least another mile to com-
plete it. Instinctively his face began to lose
its rod-of-iron expression and to take on its
accustomed one of sheep-like docility. Ho
Avas nearing home. Every day for years,
when alone, applauded by his other self,
he had rehearsed that speech, and every day
when he alighted from the tram at Fuchsia-
street he had become, as usual, the meek
and mild Mr. Pifton, the timid, well-trained,
tractable husband with no vices, the model
suburbanite, that humdrum being without
Avhose aid model suburbs would have re-
mained an estate-agent’s vague dream.
Hump-backed, his eyes on the pavement,
and resignedly clutching all his parcels, Mr.
Pifton trudged up the hill Avhich led to
Hillcrest —one of two thousand similarly
designed, neat, undistinguished modern' bun-
galows.
"We are going out sailing, Aubrey,” said
Mrs. Pifton, when, after relieving him of his
freight, she had kissed him in a perfunctory
way.
“Are we?” said Mr. Pifton wonderingly.
“When ?”
“This afternoon,” replied his Avifc. “Mr.
Mewkins has a neAV yacht, you know, and
he has asked us to go for a sail in it.”
“I suppose the felloAV came round here,”
Mr. Pifton said, frowning. He had never
liked Mewkins. MeAvkins was suspected of
being a rake. It was rumored that he had
paid marked attention to certain married
ladies.
“No, he didn’t call,” replied Mrs. Pifton,
who, whatever her other faults may have
been, was the soul of propriety. “He rang
up; and if we are to get there in time,
Aubrey, you’ll have to hurry into your other
clothes. We are to be at the Mosman wharf
at three, and you know Avliat a long time
it takes to get there from here. If we don’t
catch the next tram Ave can’t possibly do it.”
Even in his bedroom Mr. Pifton was care-
ful not to raise his voice, exercising that
caution which experience had taught him.
Mrs. Pifton had caught him once, in one of
his unguarded and excited moments, de-
claiming his wrongs to the empty air. She
had informed him that it was a sign of
incipient insanity, and his wife had been more
than usually miserable for days afterwards.
There was now. however, a sense of sub-
dued joy about his movements that the pro-
mise of an outing on the harbor, even in
another man’s boat, had given him. “So
Mewkins has a yacht,” he muttered to him-
self, as he put on a pair of white duck
trousers two sizes too large for him that
his wife had bought the week before at a
bargain sale. “He's probably been out in
it once or twice, when there wasn’t much of
a breeze blowing, and thinks he knows all
about sailing. Well, Mewkins has been theo-
rising about yachting for years. It’s time
he tried his hand at it.”
Mr. Pifton put on a gaudy golf jacket of
bis wife’s selection, a pair of canvas shoes
and a blazer coat.
“I'll bet,” he said to himself, eyeing his
reflection in the wardrobe mirror discon-
tentedly, “that I won’t get a chance at, tin*
tiller the whole afternoon. It'll be delightful
on the water a day like this, nevertheless,
although one is taking a bit of a risk going
but with an idiot like Mewkins, unless the
fellow’s had the sense to get hold of some-
one else who knows how to manage a boat.
But Mewkins wouldn’t do that. It would
prevent him from showing off.”
Mrs. Pifton was waiting impatiently for
him at the front gate. >She had a new blue
linen dress on and a becomingly trimmed
rush hat. “Do you think we'd better go,
SAME THING, SOMETIMES.
FIRST COMMERCIAL: "You look a bit thin, Bill. On diet?” .
SSECOND COMMERCIAL: “No —on commission.”
Emma?" lie said, doubtfully. "I don't think
Mewkins knows much about sailing a boat,
you know, and”
For answer Mrs. Pifton took him by the
arm and led him to the tram.
“Get in,” she said briefly, and Mr. Pifton
got in.
The “yacht” turned out to be an open
sailing-boat about twenty feet long.
Mewkins asked Mr. Pifton if he would
mind lending a hand. “I could have got
the chap I bought it off to go out with us. ’
he said, “but I thought you might like to
learn something about a boat.”
They hauled up the mainsail jib, and
Mewkins, who looked like a tailor’s adver-
tisement for yachting wear, told Mr. Pifton
what to do.
“Bet go that rope,” he shouted, as a light
and fitful breeze filled the sails.
Obediently Mr. Pifton let it go and they
were under way.
“Isn’t this glorious!” exclaimed Mrs. Pif-
ton enthusiastically, as the boat slipped out
of the tranquil bay. Do you know, Mr.
Mewkins, I don’t believe this silly old hus-
band of mine wanted to come. He s afraid
of the water—really, he is. Hint is, she
said hastily correcting herself, "he thought
perhaps it might In- too rough for me. to
her credit be it said that, however much .Mrs.
Pifton might ridicule her husband in private,
she never deliberately spoke slightingly of
him before strangers.
Regarding Mr. Pifton with a look of
amused contempt which infuriated him,
Mewkins let the Halcyon come up into the
wind while he tightened the jib. Mr. Pifton
could have tightened it without moving, for
he was sitting well up in the bow, but
Mewkins ostentatiously ignored linn in the
matter.
They had been sailing for a good hour,
when the breeze, which had been growing-
fainter and fainter, died out altogether, and
the Halcyon, with no way on, lay idly pitch-
ing and tossing in the vicinity of Bradley s
Head. A black cloud had suddenly come into
view in the south, and Mr. Pifton watched
the expression on Mewkins’s face as the
latter nervously looked aloft at tin- flapping
mainsail. “I think we’d better take a reef
in it,” he said uneasily.
Mr. Pifton knew what that cloud meant.
His married life had been spent away from
the water, and sailing, though he was fond
of it, had not for various reasons been one
of his pastimes, but lie had not spent most
of his boyhood in a sailing-boat for nothing,
and he had that instinctive seamanship
which never leaves a man when once it has
entered his soul. It came back to him now,
in a flood of feeling, as his gaze rested on
the huge and ominous black bank of wind
and rain that, with the speed of an express
train, was rushing towards them. He wanted
it to blow and he wanted it to blow hard,
lie had no sense of danger, but rather one of
exaltation. All the pent-up and suppressed
miseries, the petty annoyances and igno-
minies of his married life were ready to
burst the dam, and his heart leapt within
him. He looked at Mewkins exultantly, for
Mewkins’s face betrayed the fear that had
gripped him. Tlis hand nervously twitched
the tiller as he gazed anxiously out between
the Heads over the leaden waste of water
now so oily-looking and unnaturally calm,
Mrs. Pifton divined that there was danger
in the air. “We are going to have a storm,”
she said explosively. “Is there any danger?"
“Not the least bit,” said Mewkins with a
forced smile, striving valiantly to fight down
his growing apprehension. “This little craft
of mine can weather any blow we’re ever
likely to get. The chap I bought her from
told me she is one of the best sea boats on
the harbor,”
The two men lowered the mainsail in
silence and as hastily as possible, Mr. Biftou
kept his eyes on tire advancing southerly.
The black cloud now stretched well over-
head and the white caps on the water were
beginning to show. Suddenly he saw what
he had been expecting to see—that long
white line on the water that always means
business.
Mewkins saw it at the same time. "Look
at that!” he shouted, pale as a ghost.
With cat-like agility Mr Bit'ton leapt aft,
and snatching the tiller away from Mewkins,
brought the boat up into the wind.
Mrs. Pifton was silent and awestruck.
Mewkins crouched down in the bottom of
the boat, and Mrs. Pifton convulsively held
on to Mr. Pifton’s legs as he looked out on
the boiling cauldron which seethed round
and threatened to overwhelm them. For
half an hour or so, as he often said after-
wards, lie never saw it blow harder; then,
providentially, there came a rift in the
clouds, and as suddenly as it had sprung up
the gale subsided.
The Halcyon had been driven dangerously
close to the rocks, but it was now possible
to set all sail again.
“Haul up the mainsail!" Mr. Pifton
shouted to Mewkins.
“Hadn’t I better help you do it.- dear?”
pleaded Mrs. Pifton. “I don't think Mr.
Mewkins is very well."
“You stay where you are and keep quiet,
that’s all you’ve got to do,” said Mr. Pifton
gruffly.
Some little time later they arrived back
at the wharf from which they had set out so
gaily earlier in the afternoon. Wet through
and dejected, Mewkins crouched in the bow
ready to catch hold of the wharf as the boat,
skilfully handled by Mr. Pifton, rounded to.
On the starboard side Sat a saturated, hat-
less and bedraggled-looking lady. On her
face was a rapt expression, which betokened
an advanced degree of mingled admiration
and respect as she gazed at a small, deter-
mined-looking man who, for the past couple
of hours and for the first time in fifteen
years, had been running things to suit
himself.
At precisely eight o’clock that same even-
ing that same man, smoking a large cigar and
disseminating a faint aroma of rum, entered
the sitting-room.
“Emma,” he said, "Conic here!”
Mrs. Pifton came over and gazed at her
lord and master.
"Yes. dear,” she said, “what is it?”
“Now. Emma.” said Mr. Pifton. “we may
as well understand each other once and for
all. Hitherto, for the sake of peace and
quietness, I’ve done a great many things that
no self-respecting man would do, but I'm
fed up! I refuse to put up with-it any
longer! The kind of life you like doesn't
suit me! It’s too monotonous! For the

going to be different! Entirely different!
I’m going to run things to suit myself ! I’m
going to be master in my own house!
Master! Understand?”
Mrs. Pifton put her arms round his neck.
“My dear Aubrey,” she said, rapturously.
“I've been hoping for years that you would
talk to me like that.”

Driftwood.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lii n coastal cave, smoke-blackened, .
By a tire of driftwood blazing-
in the wild and windy midnight,
Lies an old salt, seaward gazing.
Bright liis eyes are as his camp-lire,
White his brows as its dead embers;
Stretched upon his couch of bracken,
What is it that he remembers?
Many,,clippers, many whalers,
Swift of keel or slow of motion,
Hail him as he lies a-dreapiing,
Sail with him O’er memory’s ocean.
While the waves beneath him thunder
Breaking on the rocks, white-crested.
Backward led and lured by Vision,
(Vosses seas where oft he quested.
As the wet wind, rising, sinking,
Whines and sighs in clefts and caverns,
Once again with old-time shipmates
Smacks his lips in far-off taverns.
Dreaming thus at windy midnight.
Worn and weathered, aged and lonely.
Warmed by driftwood, tide-cast driftwood,
Driftwood, driftwood is he only.

end of each chapter it gives a list of books
for advanced studies. Smaller useful books
are “Psychology,” by McDougall, and “Ele-
mentary Psychology,” by Brackenbury.
What is the difference between Liverpool
salt, S.A. coarse salt, Muston’s and Emu
coarse salt? Which is the best for sheep? —
1420.
Liverpool salt was imported from Liver-
pool before any was produced locally. Red
rock-salt is still brought from that centre.
S.A. coarse, Muston’s, Emu, etc., are all
S. Australian, and practically the same.
Three grades are supplied: crude, coarse and
colored. Crude is sold as it is scooped up;
coarse is broken to the quality used for
salting beef, etc.; and colored is merely
earth stained. If to use with molasses or
other feed, coarse is most convenient on
account of the smaller grain. Otherwise a
slight _ variation in earth-content is the
only difference.
On Service Page (l/9/’27) icas printed
a method of tanning calfskins for a coat.
(1) Is it suitable for leather for book-
binding until the hair left on. (2) How
is the hair removed? (3) Method of curing
lambskins? (4) How is the wool removed?
(5) What skins arc best for parchment, and
what is the method employed? —ls3B.
(1) Yes, quite suitable, with the addition
of the following: At the completion of the
tanning, smear the flesh side with lard or
mutton fat, and rub in vigorously. Then
stretch the skin all ways as much as possible,
nail out to dry, and when dry rub off the
lard and fat with French chalk. (2) Lime
and sodium are generally used for unliairing,
about 4oz. lime and 2oz. sodium to 5 gallons
water; 12 to 24 hours will soften the skin
sufficiently to allow the hair to be pulled or
rubbed out. This makes the skin hard, but
borax (2oz. to every gallon of water) will
soften it. This will take about 10 hours.
(3) Sheep or lamb skins when required for
bookbinding are merely cured with alum, in
three separate applications, with plenty of
washings in between ; first 7oz. of alum to 5
gallons of water, second 10oz., third 4oz.
Oil and stretch as described. (4) Wool is
taken from the pelts by sweating. Soak the
skins for 24 hours, then lay the skins wool
downwards in a sheltered place and cover
with wet bags. Air and wind must be
excluded. The more covering the better the
sweat. _ After two days the wool will come
off easily. (5) Fine sheepskins, goatskins
or liorseskins are the best, but making parch-
ment of the class now universally used is
a highly-skilled work requiring many chemi-
cals and expensive apparatus and should not
be attempted by an amateur. A rough sub-
stitute can be made by continually rubbing
the skin with oil and scraping, but the
result is not worth the effort.
In a contract for the erection of a home
what are the usual progress-payments to the
contractor ?■ —1463.
Where an architect is employed progress-
payments are usually made on the presenta-
tion of his certificate that work lias been
carried out to a specified value. Where no
architect is employed progress-payments are a
matter of agreement between the owner and
contractor, as, for example, when the foun-
dations have been completed to the satisfac-
tion of the owner or of some person named
by him or agreed upon between the parties ;
and so on.
What is the poison in ragwort?- 1414.
The director of the Botanic Gardens, .Syd-
ney, states that there are several species
of plants commonly known as ragwort or
ragweed. “Picton,” “Winton” and “Mol-
teno” diseases are said to be caused by
certain kinds of ragwort. Some of the plants
contain an alkaloid which has a tetanus-
like action.
What qualifications are necessary to
become a proofreader? —lss2.
A competent proofreader must have an
unerring eye for “literal” mistakes. lie must
possess a complete knowledge of printing
types, sizes and definitions; and be able to
correct errors of grammar. He should be
widely read and have an understanding of
world affairs. Proofreaders generally begin
as copyholders or compositors. Their pay is
looked after by the printing-trade union, not
by the journalists.
(1) Do oxen conic under the heading of
cattle? _ (2) Was the Calliope actually in-
side Apia Harbor, Samoa, during the cyclone
of March, 1888? —1609.
(1) Yes. (2) Yes. It steamed out to
sea and escaped the fate of the three German
and three American war vessels.
Is there a market for barytes? —lsB9.
There is a market in Australia for barytes
of a few hundred tons per annum. It must
be snowy white to command about 70s. per
ton delivered in lump form, Sydney. Quality
not quite snowy white may bring 50s. Send
samples to Frank Hamb ridge, 22 Bridge-
street, Sydney, and he will tell you its value.
Are deeds dated 1886 of a block of land,
part of Kurt’s estate in West Kurrajong
( N.S. IK.) of any value? As far as 1 know
rates or taxes have never been paid. —l42l.
Forward to Registrar-General, Queen’s-
square, Sydney, a description of the land and
quote the registration note appearing on the
deed. The minimum fee for search is fOs.,
with additional fees if the search proves long.
Land on which municipal rates remain un-
paid is liable to be sold by the Public
Trustee, and the proceeds devoted to the pay-
ment of the rates. But lots in the sub-
division referred to are of little value.
Is it difficult to build a four- or five-valve
wireless set?— l42B.
No, but better start with a two- or three-
valve. Directions given with kits for home
assembly are explicit.
(1) Were returned soldiers exempt from
income-tax for any period after discharge
from the A.I.F. ?— 1559.
No.
What is the best method of tattooing
numbers on the ears of stock, and where can
I get the real ink? —l4ol.
(1) Wipe the ear clean on the inside
surface. The area to be tattooed should be
that on which no hair is growing. Ink in
the stick form is best. The stick should be
moistened and rubbed on the area selected ;
the imprint with the tattoo instrument made
and the moistened ink stick again passed over
the surface. In about three or four days,
if the surface is wiped over, the tattoo should
be clear. (2) W. J. Baker, Hunter-street,
Sydney.
Why was Hawaii annexed by U.S.A. and
what was the attitude of Britain? —ls62A.
In 1893 Liliuokalani, reigning Queen of
Hawaii, was deposed and a provisional Gov-
ernment formed. In 1894 a Republic was
proclaimed and, in accordance with the re-
quest of the people of Hawaii, it was for-
mally annexed to the U.S.A. Great Britain
expressed no objection.
Is there a light steam tractor on the
market designed for field work? —1382.
A steam agricultural tractor called “The
Rhinoceros” is expected on the local market
in about five months’ time. It is said to
have been tried in England for the last 12
months and proved satisfactory. It will burn
either wood or coal, and, turning two fur-
rows, will plough about 20 acres a day. Its
weight without fuel or water is 9 tons.
How can I make paste for sticking labels?
—1586.
Mix good white flour with cold water into
a thick paste free of lumps. Add boiling
water, stirring continually until thoroughly
mixed and of about the right consistency or
slightly thinner. To three quarts of this
mixture, add Jib. of light brown sugar and
Joz. corrosive sublimate. The latter should
he dissolved in a small quantity of hot water.
When the mixture has cooled, a small quan-
tity of oil of lavender may be added. This
paste will keep for a long time.
(1) What prospects are there in commer-
cial aviation in Australia for employment as
a pilot, b mechanic, c other branches? (2)
What are the wages for pilots and mech-
anics? (3) Where can I get the training?
(4) Any other information that would be
helpful. —l62B.
(1) a Good prospects of employment for
skilled pilots of long experience and good
record, but no large number of pilots can
be absorbed in commercial aviation at the
present stage. b Good prospects for men
with aircraft experience who have a
thorough grounding in engineering. Positions
limited at present, c Not very bright. (2)
Pilots from £5OO to £BOO per annum ; mech-
anics from £6 to £9 per week. (3) Training
to become a commercial pilot can only be
obtained in Australia at Point Cook. Write
Director of Civil Aviation, St. Ivilda-road,
Melbourne. (4) A good motor-mechanic
can quickly pick up aircraft-mechanics. The
few aviation-mechanic apprentices are gener-
ally local lads. Undoubtedly aviation has a
great future and young men of ability and
determination getting in now should have
the pick of the positions.
(1) Can a course of journalism be taken
at the Sydney University? (2) How long
does it take? (3) Can it be taken at night?
(4 ''What subjects and what passes (A or
It) arc necessary for matriculation? (5)
Cost? (6) Would it be much better than
the International Correspondence School’s
jo urnalism course ? —1351.
(1) Yes, open to matriculated and un-
matriculated students. (2) Two years. (3)
Most of the subjects. (4) Presuming you
are unmatriculated your first year studies
would consist of: One course from Group
A—English (45 lectures). French I (90),
German I (90), Latin I or Greek I (90) ;
one course from Group B—Economics I (90
lectures), History I (90). Philosophy I
(90), International Law (90) ; and a special
analogous course, e.g., Anthropology (90) ;
and two courses from A, B and C—Chemis-
try I (80), Physics I (60), Geology I
(60), Zoology I (60), Botany I (60),
Second year: One further course (90 lec-
tures) consecutivewith courses already taken,
and courses (45 lectures) on History, Prin-
ciples and Practice of Journalism and Con-
stitutional Law (80 lectures). (5) £3 3s.
per subject per term (three terms per year)
and £1 Is. per term general service fee.
(6) Too soon to make a comparison.
(1) Is it necessary to obtain a license to
sell fish from house to house (/ am regis-
tered as a firm) ? (2) What arc the charges
at the Sydney market for cold-storage, clean-
ing and filleting fish? —1491.
(1) You would require a hawker’s license,
obtainable at the nearest municipal chambers.
(2) Cold-storage charges are Is. per box
of clean fish (60 to 70 lb.) for from one day
to one week. Double boxes 2s. Cleaning
charges for almost every variety are 2s. per
box, and 2s. per box for filleting.
1 am a fourth-year High School student
(female). How can I earn money in my
spare time, preferably at home?-_ —l6ll.
Depends entirely upon your capabilities
and aptitude. Extra money may be earned
at home by dressmaking, millinery, fancy-
work, cake- or sweet-making, or by other
domestic handicrafts. If you have the
talent, freelance journalism would bring in
some return. You should know best for
what you are suited. Nevertheless at your
age it is advisable to concentrate upon your
studies so that you will be better fitted to
tackle the. problem of a vocation later on.
I am feeding sheep on scrub, chiefly mulga.
C<ni you give me a formula for a good lick
which has a little food value? Is rock phos-
phate the same as superphosphate?- —159,5.
A lick made up as follows has been found
suitable for sheep in times of drought: Salt,
40 parts; bone meal, 20 parts; Epsom salts,
10 to 20 p.c., made into a stiff mass with
molasses. Rock phosphate and superphos-
phate are entirely different. Superphosphate
is not suitable to use as a lick. The best
way for supplying phosphates in a lick is in
the form of sterilised bone meal mentioned
above. Licks cannot be made as a vehicle
for supplying food, they only supply the
necessary phosphates and other salts. The
most economical way of giving nourishment
is as a ration of linseed nuts, cotton-seed
nuts, maize or other grain.
(1) Is Dr. Elliott’s treatment for per-
nicious anaemia being adopted by medical
practitioners in Melbourne? (2) Is it re-
garded as successful? (3) Is the treatise on
the subject available? —1634.
(1) Yes, by some. (2) Not yet time to
judge. (3) Full description is to be printed
in Medical Journal of Australia.
I want to make an Molian harp. How?
—1205.
Of very thin cedar, pine or other soft
wood make a box 5 or 6 in. deep, 7 or 8 in.
wide and of a length just equal to the width
of the window in which it is to be placed.
Across the top, near each end, glue a strip
of wood Jin. high and Jin. thick, for bridges.
Into the "end of the box insert wooden pins
like those of a violin to wind the strings
around two pins at each end. Make a sound
hole in the middle of the top, and string the
box with small catgut or blue violin strings,
fastening one end of each string to the
wooden pin in one end of the box, am], carry-
ing it over the bridges, wind it around the
turning pins in the opposite end of the box.
The ends of the box should be thickened
where the wooden pins enter by a piece of
wood glued upon the inside. Tune the
strings in unison and place the box in the
window. Better have four strings, as described,
but a harp with a single string produces
a sweet melody of notes which vary with the
force of the wind.
Can you tell me of any agents of good
reptile in London or U.S.A. to whom 1
could send two original farcical comediesl
Is it a sensible thing to do? —1364.
Most of the well-known literary agents
who handle dramatic works specify full-
length plays, and a letter of inquiry is ad-
usable before submitting. Leading British
firms : iCurtis Brown, Ltd., 6 Ilenrietta-street,
W.iC.2; John Farquharsou, 8 Halsey House,
Red Lion Square, W.C.I; and J. B. Pinker
and Son, Talbot House, 9 Arundel-street,

Brandt and Brandt, 101 Park-avenue, New
York. The Stage, 16 York-street, London,
W.C.2, and Theatre Magazine, 2 West
45th-street, New York, may help you. Pre-
liminary investigation is worth while; so
is copyrighting this end.

these wood pulleys with a bearing on each
outside end. The back axle of the Ford and
the axle of the wood pulleys should be tin;
same height from the ground. In between
these two pulleys (half way along the axle)
have a steel pulley and a belt from it to the

1475.—F0r a non-crumbling concrete floor
coarse river sand should be mixed with
cement in proportion of 2 to 1. To prevent
cracking the concrete should be laid in 6ft.

to mark the divisions. When the section is
spread and levelled, sprinkle sin. of pure
cement thereon, and when the stickiness has
gone smooth off with a floating trowel dipped
freely in water, (’over with wet bags and
allow the concrete to dry gradually. The
more water used on it while drying the
harder it will be. —“Pick.”
1224.—Young kangaroos should be fed
on plain cow’s milk. Place a saucer of warm

they’ll eat grass. When they reach that
stage they look after themselves. —“P.G.H.”
1120. —Cecil Wray, late of England, now
of Melbourne, invented the cinematograph
about the year 1893 at Bradford, Yorkshire.
It was an improvement on the old kaleido-
scope. His invention is recorded in the Eng-
lish publication “Living Pictures,” and the
date of his invention comes before Edison’s
bioscope. Improvements on Wray’s bioscope
followed in quick succession..—“G.S.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
J. M. Cameron took Merry Mint up to
Clarendon on Saturday to give him a run
in the Hawkesbury Spring Handicap, his
preparation having been interrupted owing
to some trouble or other with a leg. With
101 b. less than the very moderate Battlement,
who was topweiglit with 9st., the Derby
fancy was by no means badly handicapped,
and he looked pretty well. But the book-
makers were noticeably anxious to lay him,
and plenty of business was done when they
stretched the price from 6 to 4 to 5 to 2.
Third into the straight behind Kalloni (7 to
1) and Night Heron (20 to 1) , the Maori-
land tliree-year-old subsided into seventh
place in the run home, it being explained
that “Bartle didn’t over-exert him when he
found he couldn’t win.” Just when Dick
Wootton thought he was going to collect at
last Don Panther (7 to 1), a country horse,
came through on the rails and cut Kalloni
out of it by half a length ; Night Heron—
who should win at Randwick now he has
returned to form —was a good third, and
Lucy Thrice a fast-finishing fourth —she
was a long way back in the early part.
“Wot about askin’ some questions?’
shouted a leather-lunged gentleman as Merry
Mint returned to the weighing enclosure;
but the stewards took no notice. Questions
will be in order, however, if the animal wins
the Derby.
Johnstone, who is doing well this season,
rode a couple of winners—Sir Felix (5 io
1) in the Highweight Handicap and Padicol
(9 to 2) in the Three-year-old Handicap.
Matters were mostly in favor of the ring-
men. but John Wren hit them up a bit when
pigeon Pie (9 to 4), with whom Wren has
been very patient, accounted for Bacagi
(7 to 2) and Trawler (7 to 1) in the Rowley
Mile. Pigeon Pie was rather lucky, inas-
much as Bacagi’s saddle slipped and Bartle
could not give him any assistance at the
finish; still, accidents will happen. The
Hawk was one of the beaten lot in this
race. He died out in the straight, but
Octember came home well.
* * * *
The A.J.C. Derby field promises to be
above the average in number, if not in
quality. On three-year-old form Winalot
has the best credentials. He won well at
Randwick in mixed company, defeating a
possible Epsom favorite in Aorangi cer-
tainly at a difference of 201 b. at the latter s
pet distance, a mile; and in the Roseliill
Guineas, after a bad start, he ran from last
to first and stayed there. He is stoutly
bred, being by Rossendale —Princess Volga,
and ’built on staying lines. Merry Mint has
lost caste since his indifferent showing in the
Hawkesbury Spring Handicap, but he may
improve greatly during the week. He made
hacks of his field in the Hobartville Stakes
at Warwick Farm; then he beat everything
except Limerick in the Chelmsford Stakes.
Sion is fancied by his owner, but he may
require time, as did his brother Vaals, who
could not go a mile and a half anyhow.
Statesman looks more like a stayer, and Bel-
gamba’s half-brother Glenariff may also be
suited by the distance. Black Duchess is
another possibility. Victoria will be repre-
sented by Sacedon, Pitoota, Ragazzo and
Trivalve, and the last-named may be the
best, though Sacedon is doing rather strik-
ing work.
Speculators in doubles have taken a very
short price about Gothic for the Epsom and
Limerick for the Metropolitan. They will be
very sorry for themselves if the going is
heavy, and in a season so abnormal that is a
greater possibility than in normal seasons.
YVet or fine, both favorites will run against
The Bulletin. Gothic will need to be a
champion to win the Epsom with 9st. 81b.,
and his second in the Hill Stakes at Rose-
liill suggested that he is just a good horse.
Amounis was unlucky in that race, and lie
is to be preferred on Saturday with 9st. 101 b.
But if they have to plough through mud the
three nine-stoners —Fuji San, 9st. 131 b., is
the other —will drift to much more liberal
odds than have been available during the
last week or so. A very attractive candidate
is Vaals (Bst 71b.). A good three-year-old—
the third best of his year at the Epsom dis-
tance —he has matured into a fine-looking
five-year-old, and his victories at Rosehill on
September 17 were highly impressive. _ He
is at home on Randwick course and is at
his best in the spring. The only thing
against him is that he floundered in heavy
going when favorite for the Villiers Stakes.
Mullabawn (Bst. 21b.) and Aorangi (Bst.,
have likewise strong claims; Aorangi,
with 21b. less, was third last year. Among
the lightweights Pigeon Pie (6st. 111 b.)
reads best; he was eighth in the 1926
Epsom and fourth in the Doncaster.
Limerick is a high-class horse, but he has
9st. 51b. It is a tremendous weight for a
four-year-old in a race like the Meropolitan,
and Limerick will find it a very different
task from accounting for small fields in
w.f.a races. So will McCarten. the jockey,
who is rather fond of waiting for a
OVER THE ODDS.
JACKS: “Where’s that swearing parrot you had?”
FOOZLER: “I lent him to the golf club, and he dropped dead.”
run on the rails. Pantheon has 61b.
more, but he is older, more strongly built
and more accustomed to threading his way
through big fields. However, Pantheon's
starting is conditional on the going being
good. Good going is also a requisite
for Bacchus ( (Bst. 81b.), though there is
no talk of his being scratched. Kelso’s horse
has a tidy weight, but he has improved
since the autumn, and if the conditions suit
him will be very dangerous indeed. And
this Page has a weakness for Horton Gag
(7st. 101 b.), who is one of those horses
that nearly always run well. He has had
a lot of racing in 1927, but has evi-
dently thrived on it. Others with de-
cided chances are Donald (Bst. 21b.),
Murillo (Bst.) and Valparaiso (7st.), while
Tibbie (7st. 131 b.) is never to be despised
at Randwicb, And Amounis (9st. 31b.)
may possibly do what Speciality did; though
handicapped as a non-stayer he was a good
third to Pantheon and Spearfelt in the
Fisher Plate, a mile and a half, at Fleming-
ton last season, and won twice at 10 fur-
longs, beating Limerick on one occasion at
w.f.a. It wasn’t till after his third year
that Speciality showed any aptitude for the
Metrop. distance. Tote (or eacli-way)

Backers who braved the icy blasts at
Moonee Valley (Vic.) on Saturday were suit-
ably rewarded —at least, some of them were
~as three first favorites and an equal favor-
ite were successful, and all the other winners
were well backed. The chief attraction was
the Quality Handicap, a 7-furlong affair with
a maximum of 9st. Translator having been
scratched on the course. Waranton headed
the list with Bst. l()lb. He had shown form
at Mentone and looked favorably handicap-
ped, but the money came in such large
parcels for Metellus that Kellow’s gelding
finished up first choice at 5 to 2, Waranton
being half a point larger ; others well in the
market were Byron (6 to 1), David Garrick
and Nepean (7tol). Beppinsan and Darjeel-
ing were the pacemakers, but Duncan had
Metellus in front at the half-distance; and
thumbs and fingers tightened on Metellus tick-
ets. But they loosened again, for Nepean,
finishing with a wonderful run on the outside,
deprived the Valais gelding of the verdict
by a head, Darjeeling (12 to 1) being the
same distance away, with Cairncross and
David Garrick close up. Nepean is a good
horse on his day. He is a five-year-old geld-
ing by Calais-Warrianna, and is owned by
I\ T. Heywood, who had the satisfaction
of seeing Grey Friar, another of his horses,
land the Steeple. Little Brady had the
mount on Nepean, whose time was lmm.
27isec.
T. M. Burke’s versatile gelding Bombard
was backed like a good thing for the Tulla-
marine Handicap, Hi furlongs, and a good
thing he proved, for, after making the home
turn with Eridanus (10 to 1) alongside* he
went right away from that horse and the
others, winning by six lengths from the ex-
Sydney performer, Tookarby (10 to 1) being
a poor third. Piastoon, well backed at .) to
2 showed up for a time but faded out rather
suddenly, which is unusual for him. Bom-
bard’s closing price was 3 to 1. He carried
7st 121 b. It was his second run since his
fall in a hurdle race in the winter, and unless
his appearance is deceptive he can put on a
lot more condition yet. He is in the Haul-
field Cup with 7st. 81b. and the Melbourne
Cup with lib. less, and will not lack suppoit
in either, or both. The time was _min.
29sec. —nothing wonderful, but creditable m
the circumstance.
Yalicare’s brother, Avant Courier, for
whom E. M. Pearce paid 5500 guineas,
opened his account in the first division o
the Maiden Plate. Favorite at twos, he
drew awav from Aga Khan, a Baverstoc c
gelding, below the distance and beat him by
a length or so; Jedburgh was third. There
was nothing dazzling in the expensive colt s
performance, and the time (lmin. 41i : sec)
was just ordinary, but lie is sure to improve,
Whether Pearce will ever get his 5500
guineas back is another matter. High-priced
yearlings rarely turn out much good in
Australia.
$ * * *
“0.P.11.” : Vic. Premier Hogan, who at the
last minute incorporated an announcement
in his Budget that he would introduce a Tote
Bill, lias not made up his mind what sort
of a scheme he will adopt. Anyhow, the
measure, if it passes, is not to operate till
next financial year, as it will take months to
set up the machines. It is all Collins-street
to a new Mallee-farm block that it will be
a piMs-McShortodds hill, but there may ne
a provision that only present pencillers shall
be registered.
“Hotham”: It is announced that the Vic.
bagmen, as a body, are ready to welcome the
machine. Thus basely has been dissolved an
alliance between Religion and the Ring which
has endured since the sixties of last century.
L. K. S. xvxackinnon, chairman of the V.R.C.,
advises the restriction of the tote to courses
within 20 miles of Melbourne, his idea being
that the cost of fitting up the machines will
be too much for country clubs, unless taken
very gradually. But an elaborate machine
is not necessary, save where the volume of
wagering is fast and furious; and there is
no reason why the smaller outside clubs
should not be allowed to instal small outfits,
such as give every satisfaction on many out-
back courses in Queensland, Westralia and
other States which have been using the tote
for many years. The V.R.C. chairman is on
firmer ground when he suggests straiglitout
and place machines, presumably on the West-
tralian plan. There should also be a tote for
the backer of doubles, as in South Africa.
Further, the Government should be content
with 5 p.c. for its cut instead of the 9 p.c.
extorted in N. S. Wales, leaving 1H p.c. for
the clubs. Fractions and unclaimed dividends
could go to charities, as in South Aus.
* * * *
“Rake Off”: The bookmaker is fond of
emphasising the importance of bis contribu-
tion to the tax-revenue. Queensland’s
latest gambling-taxation figures go to show
that Ike is no goldmine to the Treasury.
In 1926-27 414 Tommies contributed
£34,500, an average of about £B3 Bs. As
one odds-artist supplied £913 Bs., it looks
as if some of the fraternity just take out
licenses to gain social distinction. The
Government’s Golden Casket, on the other
hand, was worth £242,772 to the public
exchequer, while the tote’s refund was
£66,900. On. these figures Ike is some-
thing of a squib, and a damp one at that.
* * * *
“Amateur Urger”: A returned traveller
has been telling a Sydney newspaper that
the South African heads provide a certain
percentage of races for apprentices, and do
not permit the youngsters to use whip or
spur. This notion was tried in N.Q. years
ago, but the brats didn’t take to it. One
of mine had a mount in the Consolation
Stakes on the last day of a pretty rough
Western meeting. The track was no
Flemington, and riding in “the larst” was
apt to be willing. “Take orf me ’ooks an
drop me fan?” my urchin whined. “W y,
’ow’s a man goin’ t’ ’ang on round the corners
an’ mix it with the other blokes, then?”
Footbrawl
A biting wind and driving showers made
football unpleasant for both players and
spectators at the Vic. Reague’s second semi-
final between Collingwood and Geelong,
and the attendance wilted to about
50,000—40.595 plus deadheads, with a
“gate” of £2199 19s. 9d. Collingwood
marked well, showed tenacity in ground
play, was swifter to the ball than Geelong
and less inaccurate in kicking it. But
one side can’t make a game, , and the
seasiders were little better than lay figures,
slow, slack and clumsy. The marvel was
how they ever got into “the four.” A free
kick to Jerram gave them a goal soon after
starting, but they didn’t score another
point till just before the long interval; then
’Wood had 9 goals 10 beliinds, Geelong 1
goal 2 beliinds, and all interest had gone
out of the game. At lemon-time the Mag-
pies owned 93 points to Geelong's 16. The
leaders eased up a little in the last term,
so that the final tally was ’Wood 114 points,
Geelong 48. Gordon Coventry booted 7
goals, bringing his total for the season to
95 —6 more than “Bonnie” Campbell's
(W.A.) previous Australian record. Play
became willing towards the end, but the
awful discrepancy in the scores took all joy
out of it.
Across the railway, at the Motordrome,
Coburg and Port Melbourne, of the Associa-
tion. replayed their drawn semi-final before
13,000 enthusiasts. This time there was no
level pegging. Port went off with the lead
and kept it relentlessly until at bell-ring it
boasted 97 points to Coburg's 48. It was
Coburg’s first licking tliis season, and it has
still the right to meet the winner of the
Brigliton-Port final.

BALLADE OF LITTLE HOPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Now day awakes to warm delight,
Where once the winds were shrill and
keen,
And winter flings his mantle white
No more upon the frosted green
Where poets have already seen
The lambkins at their pretty play ;
But I —my sordid thought has been:
In spring do punters have a say?
Too long have I bestowed my mite
Upon some prad of noble mien,
Who ever fought a losing fight
When whips appeared upon the scene.
The season’s malice ’twas, I ween —
Or hope—so oft I’ve had to pay
For frenzied bets to books serene—
In spring do punters have a say?
Your winter tracks with hurdles dight
Have cost me many a hard-earned bean ;
My neddy, though a jumper hight,
Some fence is certain to careen;
And if to flat events I lean
He labors in a larger clay
Than others. Hence I ask —with spleen -
In spring do punters have a say?
Envoy.
Lift me, ye gods of chance, the screen,
A little on the coming day.
One item only would I glean :
In spring do punters have a say ?
VICTORIA.

South Australian football is winding up
in a blaze of excitement. The West Adelaide
XVIII, “minor” premiers, went down in a
close game on Saturday to their eager pur-
suers throughout the season, North Adel-
aide, scores being 51 (8-3) to 47 (6-11) in
THE BUMP OF LOCALITY.
TTHE UNDER DOG: “Where am If Where am I?”
SMART BOY: “’Ere y’are, sir, map of Sydney — on’y sixpence!”
North's favor. The pair had met in three
previous matches: West won by 10 goals 12
behinds to 8 goals 10 behinds and by 12-8
to 10-12; then North kicked 10-11 to 0-4, so
there is very little between them. West has
the right of challenge, and the decider will
be played next Saturday. The ground had
to be cleared by mounted police after last
week’s game, which is unusual for Adelaide.

N.S.W. Soccer enthusiasts attended Syd-
ney Sports Ground in great force to see the
battle for the Gardiner iCup. Gladesville-
Ryde defeated Granville by 2 goals to nil,
after a fast and lively game in which McKis-
sock, in goal, and Kyle, at inside left, were
conspicuous for the successful side. The
Cup, which carries with it the championship
of N.S.W., was first played for in 1888;
Granville won it in 1022, and Gladesville-
Ryde’s victory is its first, the club having
been formed under the district scheme which
came into force a couple of years ago. As
Gladesville-Ryde looks a “moral” for the
metropolitan premiership, the young club is
well on its way to accomplish a unique
double event.

The Rugby Union Waratahs flattered their
warmest admirers by beating Newport, a
very formidable Welsh club, by ,20 points to
3 —6 tries and a goal to an unconverted
try. The game was played in wet and muddy
Conditions to which the defeated side is well
accustomed, so there can be no excuse on
that score. The 1905 All Blacks beat New-
port by G to 3; the first Springboks suc-
ceeded, 8-0, but the second lot were beaten,
9-3; the Wallabies won, 5-3; the undefeated
All Blacks of 1924 just scraped home, 13 to
10. On Saturday the tourists tackled a
combination of two other big Welsh clubs,
Neath and Aberavon. described as of almost
international strength, and again scored a
runaway victory, 24 points to s—three5 —three con-
verted tries, two penalty goals and a try to
a converted try. Two new backs were tried,
King (Western Suburbs) replacing Wallace
in the centre and Gordon (Y.M.C.A.) taking
Bowers’s place on the wing. Both men per-
formed ably, while Lawton was again in
great buckle —he kicked five goals.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
There were only a few hundreds visible
at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday night
when Stan Craig (9st. 91b.) was given a
date with young Jack Pilkington (9st.
7|lb.). Actually it was the smallest attend-
ance ever seen at a Saturday-night contest
since the Stadium was built. Craig looked
fit as a man could be, while the Yank was
pounds heavier than he should have been.
Pilkington went after Craig from the bell.
Stan, perfectly cool, blocked and ducked and
side-stepped a lot of vicious swings, but a
swift right caught him on the chin and put
him to sleep for more than five minutes.
The count was finished exactly one second
before the three-minute round was over. A
feature of the evening’s sport was the knock-
ing-out of tough Pat Levings (9st. 61b.) by
a stranger named Jack Murray (9st. 91b.).
Murray is deserving of a further oppor-
tunity of proving his quality.
* * * *
“Mitt Sliover”: After “a vast,” as they
say in Lancashire, of talk, blither, newspaper
correspondence and fancy skite, Dene Tun-
ney, the holder, and Jack Dempsey, the chal-
lenger, condescended to get down to plain
fight for the world’s heavyweight champion-
ship. The actual meeting took place m
Chicago, and after precisely 30 minutes ot
stoush for which the competitors cut up
some £260,000, Tunney retained his title on
points. Much the superior boxer, he cut
Dempsey to pieces,
save in one round,
the seventh, which
has been utilised
by the supporters
of the beaten man
as a pivot on which
to base the custom-
ary accusation of
daylight robbery.
In this round
Dempsey knocked
the champion down
with a stiff left-
hook to the jaw.
Instead of retiring
to his corner, as he
had been warned
before the fight to
do in such an
emergency, Demp-
sey stood near the
prostrate Tunnev,
evidently hoping ’>n
pounce on him as
the man was rising
—the trick which
enabled him to
knock out the
Argentine) Fir p o
in New York. The
referee, quite pro-
perly, did not com-
mence counting till
Dempsey had
obeyed the rule,
the result being that Tunney had the benefit
of some 13 seconds’ rest. ' Tunney himselt says
he was able to rise at “five,” but his
signalled him to stay down till “nine. Ibis
accords with his reputation for cool-headed-
ness and ringcraft and with wliat actually
happened. As soon as he rose he beat oit a
furious rushing attempt to finish him, anti
employed the remaining rounds in making a
chopping-block of his antagonist, who was
badly damaged at the end, while the victor
was unmarked.
* * * *
The thousands who had absented them-
selves from the Miller-Clapliam match were
back at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday
night, when Billy Edwards (12st. 3Jib.) and
Ted Thye (12st. 71b.) battled for the latter s
“title.” Billy’s act, familiar though it is,
went as well as ever; but in the few bursts
of orthodox wrestling he was outclassed,
though for five rounds he escaped being
pinned. In the sixth Willie applied fearsome-
looking headlocks, and Edward gave a life-
like imitation of a man staggering, but just
when he appeared to be completely subdued
he secured a barred toehold that made the
Canuck tap frantically. Bong after the
other had yielded Ted hung on to the toe,
and Bill followed him to his corner swinging
both fists wildly. Returning to Ins own
angle, he followed the new fashion set by
Sam Clapham and decided that the leg was
incapable of further resistance. The huge
crowd was satisfied, or seemed to be.
The Ins and Outs
“Shrewsbury”: Sydney papers are still
calling upon their gods to witness that, the
giving of a Test match to Brisbane is a
monstrous injustice to the Ma State, lhe
loudest yelp was that the English authori-
ties would not see pore ole Noo South croolly
wronged. One of the leaders of the press
agitation sent to London for a consensus ot
English opinion on the iniquity. _ It was
a misguided step, for all the authorities con-
sulted, from Lord Harris to Percy .Chapman,
were unanimous that the board’s decision
was the right one, and followed naturally
on Queensland’s highly successful entry to
the Sheffield Shield competition. The agita-
tors have now fallen back on the terrible
cost which the loss of one Test will entail
on the Ma State’s cricket finances. Every
improvement contemplated, from encourag-
ing the juniors to building new stands at the
Sydney Cricket Ground, will have to be for-
gone. ‘ But the governing body, on its own
showing, has a credit balance of over ±3U.OUU,
and will have a Test and two State matches
against the Englishmen, so this weep also
seems overdone.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro” : W. M. W oodfull is mak-
iug his own attempt to solve the problem of
playing big cricket without tears, a problem
which is giving profound concern to players
who have tried to balance cash received for a
season’s continuous play in first-class games
against wages lost by absence from work.
Woodfull is a State-school teacher, and he
has received from his Government permission
to carry on a cricket coaching school. For
this the Government decrees that he may
receive payment if the coaching is done out-
side departmental hours.
“Lancaster Park”: The English counties
are continuing to show themselves highly
appreciative of Antipodean cricketers. Glou-
cestershire, which once adopted Jack Ferris,
has arranged with Dacre, the dashing Maori-
land batsman, to play with the county in
11)21) —he can’t qualify before. Dacre, who is
also a Maoriland Soccer rep., is English-born,
so his case is on all fours with that of Mid-
winter rather than that of Ferris.
* * * *
“Centurion” : Some months ago a Buli.e-
tin writer referred to a curious cricket hap-
pening in Victoria. A junior team required
one run to win a premiership, but it had only
a wicket in hand and one of the rabbits had
to face a formidable fast bowler. The express
went back twenty yards or so, as was his
fashion, and turned; thereupon the bats-
men, by preconcerted arrangement, ran, and
reached their objective creases safely. The
controversy as to whether a run could be scored
in such circumstances had to be referred
for solution to the Marylebone C.C. That
august body has decided that the ball was in
play, but that, as the rules do not allow of a
run being scored in such a way, the run
should be regarded as a bye. It is a fool
decision, for a bye counts equally with a
run off the bat, and the players who took a
very doubtful point have apparently suc-
ceeded.
* * * *
“Bumpkin”: Radio is developing so
rapidly and recent experiments have been
so promising that it is possible _ the Cold
Country will listen-in to descriptions of
next year’s Tests, broadcast on the spot. It
Isn’t likely, however, that many millions will
avail themselves of the opportunity. Cricket
is slow enough to watch these days, but
a description when, say, a left-hander was
batting would be very nearly maddening.
And English listeners would have to get up
at three in the morning and stay awake till
breakfast-time to follow a day’s play. No,
I think the telegraphed reports will do most
people still.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: The visit of the French team
has been clinched at last. All going well,
Borotra, Brugnon and Cochet will reach Aus-
tralia by January 24, and will appear in the
Australian championships, the date of which
has been put back to February 4. In addi-
tion, they will play three matches against
Australia: in Melbourne on Feb. 9, 10 and
II ■ in Sydney on Feb. 10, 17 and 18; and
m Adelaide on
March 1, 2 and 3.
There will also be
exhibition matches
in Melbourne on
Feb. 28, 24 and 25,
and in Perth on
March 7 and S;
the Gauls will leave
for South Africa
on March 10. Fifty
per cent, of the
gross gates will go
to the French
Tennis Association,
which will pay
expenses. When
overseas Davis Cup
teams visited us the
tourists took 50 per
cent. net. The last
Davis Cup meeting
of Australia and
Britain at Sydney
in 1919 drew a gate
of £lO,OOO.
* *
“Cross Court”:
If Jack Crawford
isn’t hopelessly
stale, Harry Hop-
man has become a
formidable rival to
the young N.S.W.
champion. In the
battle for the cap-
taincy of Sydney's
Western Suburbs
he beat Crawford
6-4, 6-3, and tliar
after he had played
a punishing three
sets against A.
Willard in the
semi-final. There
is no getting away from the merit ot Hop-
man’s achievement; still Crawford will be
all the better for being turned out to grass
for a couple of months before the Frenchmen
arrive..
* * * *
“Cut Shot” : As a result of the Gallic cap-
ture of the Davis Cup, the next challenge
round will be decided on. hard courts, since
France doesn’t play on grass. This will
probably lead to the general use of hard
courts for big tennis tourneys. Grass vanes
greatly according to conditions and climate.
The hard court, on the other hand, can easily
be standardised and give the same results m
Paris as Timbuctoo. The survival of the
grass courts is a fetich bequeathed from the
day when the game was evolved for the
pleasant English lawns which gave it half its
name. Turf of any kind is impossible in
many countries where the hard court is
easily practicable. Now that tennis has
taken on an international character, some
measure of standardisation is inevitable.
What more important than the standardi-
satioii of a type of court which will offer
no advantage to the home team !
Car and Cycle
“Trembler”: The two round-the-world
motor-cyclists, Captains Malins and Oliver,
who have been staying over in Australia iu
connection with their inquiries on behalf ot
the British film industry, left Sydney last
week for Maoriland on their way to com-
plete the second half of their tour. They
reached Australia via Europe, Persia and
India; on landing in America they intend
to cross the continent with as little sleep
as they can do with, finally shipping from
New York to London. Save for intervening
stretches of sea, the whole tour has been
made on their British-built motor-cycles.
These have given them no occasion for
worry on the long reliability trial through
a dozen different countries and climates.
* * * *
“Trembler”: What is claimed to be the
longest and severest endurance test in the
world was the contest for the Angelli Cup,
held in Italy recently over a distance of
2305 miles. The competing cars had to be
standard machines from stock, selected by a
jury from the Turin Auto Club. The route
began at Turin, and the sealed cars had to
make a complete circuit of Italy, returning to
the starting point. The winner turned up in
one of the smallest cars in the event, a Fiat
509, the total time taken being 88 hours 20
minutes. The cars had to pass through 27
official checking-stations, some of them secret.
The winning car’s piston displacement was
only 990 c.c.
!'! * * *
“Transcon” : A good performance was put
up in Uncle Sam’s dominion when one A.
Jenkin drove a stock sedan car of one of
the well-known makes from the Atlantic to
the Pacific coast. The distance, about 3000
miles, was covered in 77hrs. 40min., lower-
ing the previous best by 2hrs. 15min. This
is pretty good going, especially when the
obstacles in between the starting and finish-
ing points are considered.

“Garry”: The new Lizzie which the
Ford plants commenced to produce on
August 1 is a 4-cylinder affair, like the
THE MOURNER.
ANCIENT: “Mr. Brown, I believe? My grandson is working in
your office.”
BROWN: “Oh, yes! He went to your funeral the day Railways
won the final of the Wednesday League competition.”
old one, but about twice as powerful.
Wlieel-base is longer, body lower. Balloon
tyres, four-wheel brakes, four speeds, and
all the little gadgets that Ford’s competi-
tors used to smash up his monopoly are
included in the specification. It has cost
about 75,000,000 dollars to get the plants
into shape to produce the new bus.
* * *
“Chevroford” : A Melbourne business man
motoring out of the city the other evening
timed himself. He entered Swanston-street
from Franklin-street at half-past five. At
five minutes to six he had escaped over
Princes Bridge. Distance, five blocks. The
amount of petrol spent “idling” in our con-
gested cities annually would build all the
wharves needed in half a dozen outer ports.

“Baffy”: Ben Nettlefold has returned to
Australia after playing in the British cham-
pionships and some of the Continental tour-
neys. The result of his trip, as expressed
by himself, is interesting—he is remodelling
his game. For an ex-Australian amateur
champion this * can be described only as
modesty personified and held up as a shin-
ing example to el b cracks from Hobart to
Hall’s Creek. The fact that he has still a
thundering lot to learn —he gives the total
as “101 things”— lias been impressed on the
young Tasmanian by his experiences against
the overseas top-notchers. It is his inten-
tion to give np public golf for a ivliile and
settle down to quiet practice.
* * =!: *
“Mid-Iron”: Ail those stories in The
Bulletin about crows and frogs and dogs
and plain golfers have evidently roused emu-
lation in England. Consider the storv of a
broken-winged pigeon that was succored by
one of the club professionals at Combe Hill.
The grateful fowl, though perfectly recov-
ered, “never thinks of leaving the course” ;
it accompanies players on their rounds,
watches their shots and hovers over the ball
to guide tbe striker to where it lies. When
the round is finished, the pigeon comes back
to the clubhouse, perches on the tables, “and
listens intelligently while members refresh
themselves.” It seems a merciful dispensa-
tion of Providence that the bird is a pigeon
and not a parrot.
* ❖
“Colonel Damurize”: I read with pleasure
the opinion of an eminent American medico
on the important matter of women con-
sidered as golfers. “They are the worst
mental hazard in the game,” says this dis-
cerning scientist; “the presence of females
multiplies the strain of playing, encour-
ages outbursts of temper, and prevents that
mild and beneficent mood which is golf’s
greatest boon for the man of middle age.”
I had a first-hand experience of the truth
of this the other day. I was deluded into
taking part in a mixed foursome, and was so
unfortunate as to duff a fairly easy approach
and land in a cross bunker. Remarking
that it was just like her luck to have a
dashed old duffer wished on to her, my flap-
per partner threw her cigarette away and
took a pretty niblick shot out of the bunker,
leaving me a 12-inch putt. In my agita-
tion, I missed it, and, sooner than submit
to tbe creature’s further criticism, left for.,
the clubhouse while she was climbing out of
the bunker. I have carefully avoided her
since, but am credibly informed that she.
lias told everyone that “the silly old pot”—
meaning myself—“must have ‘stopped a few’
before starting out on his merry-go-round.”
* ❖ ❖ ❖
“Mid Iron”: The Maorilanders, who hold
the Kirk-Windeyer Cup, have fixed the date
for the next struggle for the trophy—the
third week in January. The match, of
course, will be played on the other side of
the Tasman, though the course has not yet
been announced. Preparations are already
being made to receive an inrush of Aus-
tralian players and visitors, and it is to be
hoped that South Australia will send across
a team. Last year’s entry comprised, in
addition to Maoriland, Victoria, N.S.W. and
Queensland. With the Nettlefolds back,
perhaps Tas. will feel emboldened to have a
shy at the Cup.
=i= * * *
“Divot”: The inglorious uncertainty of
golf was well illustrated the other day at the
Metropolitan Golf Club’s annual meeting in
Melbourne, when Ivo Whitton easily defeated
this year’s amateur champion, W. S. Nan-
kivell, in a 36-hole bogey contest. Whitton
had finished well down the course when
Nankivell. won, a couple of weeks earlier,
but this time he lost the champion, winning
9. up, three strokes ahead of Barton Adams,
who was second, and four ahead of Nankivell.
Miscellaneous
“Billy the Goose" : I’ve bin’ wordin’ some
o’ tlie boys about interducin’ night goar-
racin’ in Noo South —with the Tommies
standin’ up, o' course. I got the office it
could be fixed orl right, but, blime, I ain’t
the Commonwealth Bank, as they seems t’
think. Unless somethin’ ’appens ter change
the situashun, I’ll ’ave t’ ’ang up me enter-
prise. Y’ see the Noo South Goat Act uv
IS9S, seckshun 2, says anyone usin’ a goat
or dorg t’ “draw any cart, carriage or truck”
can be mopped fer 30 bob the first time an’
a fiver the second. It says nuthin’ about
what ’appens after that, but a cove ’d ’ave
t’ dig a big ’ole in a tenner t’ get that far.
An’, with, the way the banks is buttonin’
up it ain’t safe t’ take no finanshul risks.
* * * *
“Hot Dog” : As if the fining of an Epping
bookmaker and the embargo in Vic. and
Queensland wasn’t worry enough, a threat
to the tin-hare nobility comes from England.
Some misguided genius has placed on the
market a robot rabbit apparatus capable of
being fitted up on any convenient open space.
A company has been formed to exploit the
invention; it undertakes to supply portable
grandstands, travelling bookmakers, and
every other requirement. The prospectus
is attractive in the main, though the idea
of a bookie who is here to-day and gone
to-morrow is not particularly alluring.
Some of them are like that already.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: There was a touch of
humor, for once, about the tin-hare meeting
at Epping (N.S.W.) the other night. One
of the Tommies got tired of fielding and
went for a spell. He pocketed his money
but left his tickets in the bag on his stand.
When he got back he found a bright bird
wearing the bag and offering outrageous odds
to all and sundry. The stout lad spotted
the real Mackay bustling through the crowd
and did a successful bustle himself in the
other direction. It is a variation of a good
old dodge which one often strikes at the
ponies. It’s been worked at the ped. meet-
ings, too. Some unknown once got away
with a hundred up at Charters Towers for
undertaking that one of my lads would run
a bye in the Sheffield. The lad won, as he
was meant to do, and a fine mess I dropped
into when the mug went howling to the com-
mittee about the wad he’d lost laying against
him. He couldn’t identify me as the cove
that had worked the joke, so there was no
disqualification. But the committee, like all
their sort, were dashed nasty about it, and
recommended me to pull out my entries for
the other events and give the game a go
somewhere else, for a change. A lot of
squibs !
* * * *
“Heine Shprintz” : Our Olympic selectors,
whoever they may be, can learn something
from figures put up at the recent inter-
national meeting at Cologne. Gumming, the.
New York sprinter, ran 100 metres in 10
3-ssecs, equalling 11. M. Abraham’s time at
Paris in 11)24. Dr. Peltzer, the German,
beat Martin, the French crack, in the 1000
metres and broke the world’s record; his
time, 2min. 25 4-ssec, was 1 2-ssec better
than Martin’s achievement in Switzerland
last year. England’s Lord Burghley annexed
the 110 and 200 metres hurdles in 15 lfSsec
and 24 3-5 sec. respectively; over the longer
distance he equalled the world’s record,
held by Hillman, an American. In the same
week, Anderson, a Norwegian, equalled
Cumming’s figures for the 109.362 yards. If
the best of our athletes can’t approach these
times they had better be kept in Australia.
“Splash”: A couple of Australia’s most
cherished swimming records have been
smashed by Johnny Weissmuller. The slip-
pery German-American won the TJ.S. outdoor
half mile in lOmin. 22 l-ssec. —9 4-ssec.
better than “Boy” Charlton’s time at the
Sydney Domain bath last January when
racing Takaishi. Weissmuller’s go was a
fair one, too, for it was done at Honolulu
in ILO yard laps. At the same meeting
Johnny won the 440 in 4min. 52sec., 7 4-ssec.
CHARLIE KELLEWAY, who has been
elected a delegate to the executive com-
mittee of the N.S.W. Cricket Associa-
tion.
faster than Charlton’s Australian figures for
the distance. As Weissmuller put up a new
world’s record in the 220 (2min. 13 3-ssec.)
and beat Takaishi over the hundred metres
in 58sec., lie has, beyond all doubt, estab-
lished himself as that rare bird in swimming
or any other form of racing, a champion in
both sprint and distance events.

“Splash”: The first public appearance of
the Australian swimmers in Japan was in
an international contest against Japan and
America at Osaka. The Australian show-
ing was no worse than mi&ht have been
expected, but the team was outclassed. Our
best performance on the opening day was
Queenslander Grier’s second in the 200-
metres free style, won by an American ; Vic-
tor Moore, of N.S.W., was sixth. The team
was third in the 200-metres relay, America
and Japan filling the other places. T.
Boast, of Queensland, scored another third
place in the 200-metres backstroke, won by
Laufer of America. In the 100-metres sprint
on the second day Laufer won from another
American, C. Crabbe. in 61sec., Grier being
third this time and Henry fourth. Crabbe
won the 400-metres, no Australian compet-
ing, and the 100-metres backstroke was taken
GENE TUNNEY, who retained the world’s
heavyweight championship in Chicago
last week, when he beat Jack Dempsey
for the second time.
by Laufer, Boast being third. America also
captured the 800-metres relay, with Japan
and Australia in that order, and ran out the
easiest of winners on points. Takaishi did
not turn out for Japan, but will be seen at
the Pan-Pacific championships, which open
at Tokio on Saturday. An endeavor is to be
made to bring the American team from
Japan to Australia this season.
“Slide”: The race for the Westralian
champion sculls, rowed over a two-mile
course on the Swan River, resulted in an
easy win for Langley, of the W.A.It.C.; he
beat his clubmate Trouchet by five lengths
in 12min. 54 2-ssec. A very fast spin, if the
figures are correct.
* * *
“Barnabas”: Members of the combined
Sydney yacht clubs put in some good work
when they collected the money for a motor-
launch for two returned-soldier mates, one of
whom is blind and the other sorely crippled.
The pair can seek recreation only in fishing,
and this they did in Sydney Harbor, and out-
side it, in a decrepit old launch. The new
ark is a self-starter, and equipped in the
fullest detail.
* # * *
“Don C.”: Mention of card games (B.
15/9/’27) recalls that faro lends itself most
to a gambling system because a player can
back a card for as little, or as much, as he
likes, and he has only to beat one man—
the banker. Yet, knowing the impossibility
of beating the bank, the faro dealer welcomes
system players, and they are generally parted
from their coin sooner than their fellow-
gamblers. The most deadly of all, to the
crank, is the doubling-up system, which has
ruined scores of players. In a Sydney faro
school some time back a Yankee player
started to back a three, doubling his wager
each time it lost. It cost him £5OO, and
after he had retired another player followed
it up without success. Thinking it was about
time the three started to win, a well-known
horse owner took it on. When it had cleaned
him out, it lost six more times in succession
—2B times in all.
* * * *
“C.D.”: Just as the train was steaming
into Kelso Brasher dealt the goose four
queens and slipped himself four kings. The
other sharpers dropped out, and it was for
the goose to bet. “Ten bob,” he said. “Ten
more,” returned Brasher. “Up another ten,”
said the goose. “Ten more,” rejoined
Brasher; and at it they went, hammer and
tongs, until the train pulled in at the station.
“Sorry,” said the goose, “but I get off here.
What have you got?” “Four kings.” replied
Brasher, tabling them. “Bad luck,” said the
goose, producing four aces; and, scooping
in the money, he made for the door. “You’re
a fine sort of mug,” jeered a buttoner, when
the goose had departed. “Why didn’t you
stop him? I don’t know what you could have
been thinking of to let him get away with all
that money.” “I do,” said Brasher mourn-
fully ; “I was wondering what he did with
the four queens I dealt him.”
Business, Robbery, etc.
“F.T.” : In three months the Victorian
police delivered 48,419 summonses and
17,214 distress warrants, and 7GSI of the
pile were on behalf of cash-order firms and
money-lenders. In Victoria the pursuit of
crime might be represented as a fleet-footed
Sikes followed at a great distance by a
panting person half-buried under a mound
of stationery.
* * * *
“F.Y.7” : Queensland’s sugar crop this
season will go about 34 million tons of cane.
The total sugar production is estimated at
about 460,000 tons, with an additional 25,000
tons from N.S.W. Australia’s consumption
is expected to be about 68 per cent., which
will leave 155,200 tons available for sale
overseas, probably at £l2 a ton. The final
value of the Australian crop should be
about £2l 10s. a ton, a drop of £3 on last
year’s values.
;|c * * *
“Cuchulain” : It’s easy to get Australian-
made goods if you want them. My sister
bought an Australian-made winter turnout —
in our own town, too. The jazzy coat and
skirt were guaranteed “made in Australia
from Australian wool.” A jumper bought
to complete the costume bore a like trade-
mark. Australian manufacturers can do
it if they get the only encouragement worth
while—consistent public support.

“Pomme”: What is wrong with the Mur-
rumbidgee irrigation area? Though I live
within 24 miles of it, tfie greengrocer brings
to my back door South Aus. celery (Is. 9d.
a stick), Tasmanian carrots (sd. a bunch)
and cauliflowers from Vic. (3s. each). Last
Christmas I walked the length of Banua-
avenue, Griffith, looking for fresh fruit; all
I could buy was a few dried-up apricots.
Drought lies on the land, but it is no use
going to the irrigation settlers for fodder;
they can't supply themselves. What an oppor-
tunity missed !
* * *
“Trampas”: Australian sharks (B.
15/7/’27) haven’t had to wait for the yacht
Ishtar and Dr. Ehrenreich to get some com-
mercial “hurry-up.” Shark-fishing has been
on a profitable basis in North Westralia and
Port Stephens (N.S.W.) for some time. Now
two men who know the job are about to deal
in a big way with the swarms of sharks on
the Great Barrier Reef and collect their cut
from the Asiatic dried-fish market. As China
imports £12,500,000 worth of dried-fish annu-
ally, at £56 and more per ton, prospects look
good.
* * * *
“Chevroford”: There were just as many
farmers feeling the hocks of the new models
in the motor section at the Melbourne Show
as gloating over the Clydesdales or *he
Shorthorns. Motor registrations reflect the
new fashion. Forty p.c. of new registra-
tions in winter and 50 p.c. in summer go to
the country in Victoria. The popular notion
that settlement waits for the railway isn’t
borne out by the facts. Over 2000 towns in
Vic. depend on motor transport, the nearest
railway-station being far away. Even the
farmer’s correspondence patronises the pet-
rol waggon more than the steam engine.
Australian letters travel 21.000,000 miles
by car as against 18,000.000 by rail, and
there is more than six times as much road
mail route as railway line.
* * * *
“S.T.S.” (London) : Burgoynes don’t seem
to be enthusiastic about Australian wine
now. On one of the advertising menus
you see in country hotels I find: (1) On
the front a reference to Burgoyne’s “quality
wines of the Empire,” but with pictures of
Paarl amber hock and Veldt burgundy only;
(2) on the back, a manifesto on the duty
of an Englishman to support British vine-
yards, with “great selective scope amongst
the wine productions of Australia and South
Africa.” This is all Australia gets, whereas
two Cape wines are boomed in large type.
The whole thing is headed “The Wine Indus-
try of South Africa.” and at the foot diners
are urged to send to Burgoyne House for
“South African price-list.” As an ad. for
Australia it is worse than useless.
* * * *
“F.J.8.8.”: Re cargo pillaging (B.
S/9/’27). When trading from England to
Australia we employed watchmen in every
hold while loading, and also in every Aus-
tralian port while discharging. We never
heard one complaint or protest from the
lumpers, but the presence of the watchmen
did not suffice to prevent pillaging. Our
experience was: Adelaide, least; Melbourne,
bad; Sydney, worse; Brisbane, very bad.
The explanation is that home-port cargo is
more dangerous to touch, as it may be dis-
covered on the spot; therefore, attention is
turned to the cargo of later ports. Henee,
though Brisbane’s losses are heaviest, Bris-
bane wharflaborers most likely pillage less
than the Adelaide men. Crews are seldom to
blame for pilfering, because mostly they come
on board after the ship is loaded and the
hatches have been battened down and locked.


Remarkable perhaps
but unquestionably the most genuine
proposition in Radio to-day!

STOCKINGS
Those early ambassadors of spring, the
rhododendrons, are established in blazing
glory at the Botanical Gardens. White and
pink and cerise and subtle hues in between,
they are spendthrift as a wanton of their
charms. Up the paths near by the misty
mauve of the wistaria droops gracefully;
while japonica turns a white and pink radi-
ance to the day, and the thickly blossoming
and honeyful white wistaria, tinged with a
suggestion of ivory, looks as though a
Chinese lacquer screen and not the green
curtain of leaves should be its background.
Thousands with the old Pagan urge of usher-
ing in the spring in their veins made pil-
grimage to the Gardens on Sunday; and the
gods in the tree-tops smiled even as they
might have done on Endymion.
The drought, which still grips the country,
is mainly responsible for the dullness of social
Sydney. Of dances and cabarets there are
no end, but they are all in the interests of
charity, and a ball just for the fun of it is
unheard of. Business, too, is slack in the
rag trade; “not even during the plague
scare of old were fewer dresses bought,” the
proprietor of one expensively-select shop
frankly owns.
Dr. Bill McKay blushed with joy the
other night when Frances Alda made the
Great Hall of the Univei’sity resound with
her thanks to him for kindnesses received.
The singer spent her last night in Aus-
tralia pouring out her song for the benefit
of the University Appeal; and the recital
should net a sizeable cheque, for listeners
filled the Great Hall. Alda made her ges-
ture for the Higher Education against the
very effective background of the Gobelin
tapestry of “Joseph and his Brethren.” Her
dress was a Lorelei affair of shimmering
sea-blues and sea-greens, and the brevity
of its centre front was balanced by the long
sweep of its gold-lined train. Operatic arias
filled most of the bill, and the singer’s last
appearance was in perhaps her most brilliant
flight. The listening intelligentsia’s applause
rang out as loud and insistent as that
of the most philistine of audiences, until
in all nine encores had been given. Pianist
Max Rabinowitsh was again the master
accompanist, and Deputy-Chancellor Justice
Street spoke the Senate’s thanks to the
singer.
One of the happiest of the week's dances
was run by the nurses of South Sydney Hos-
pital. The Wentworth flew a special dis-
play of decorations for the event. Matron,
in lettuce-green sparkling with rhinestones,
did the honors at a crowded table, cheery
with flat wicker-boxes, over the edges of
which red carnations smiled like Spanish
senoritas. Nurse O’Dea, the energetic sec-
retary of the money-raiser, purred satisfac-
tion over rose velvets ; hut the poor treasurer,
Nurse Regan, had the ’flu and stayed at
home. Black cats and caps were sold in
the interests of the funds, and were worn
with as much gaiety by the oldest medicine
man as the youngest pro. A party of B.M.A.
brethren specially interested in this house of
healing sat in consultation at one large
board and unanimously prescribed Scotch.
Tasmanian Chief Justice Nicholls’s lady
came to the party in green and ivory, and
was under the wing of a rose-clad nursing
daughter. Phyllis Cooley was another of
the night’s successes, in pink and silver
wrappings.
A Mosman girl whose name has a tang of
the heather in it, Jessie Hepburn McKenzie,
was shepherded into matrimony by Padre
Cocks at the local Methodist Chapel last
week. She had turned herself into a floating
mist of white georgette and Brussels lace for
the occasion, and the claimant was Leslie
Thorne, formerly of Melbourne. Three maids
in rainbow georgettes followed the principal
lady, and all made merry later in the pink-
and-wliite-decked Arizac Memorial Hall.
St. Mary’s, in Ridge-street, North Syd-
ney, sought the aid of the friendly cabaret
last week, and the Ambassadors’ floor
vibrated to the foot-beats of five hundred
dancers. They, of course, were almost en-
tirely of the female of the species, and
though no poet might write of them as
Tennyson did of his Maud, that her feet have
touched the meadows and left the daisies
rosy, still they were hearty dancers and
seemed to be having the time of their lives.
Mrs. Murray Curtis was the president of the
afternoon and put much of herself into greet-
ing even the late arrivals. Of these one
was Queenslander Mrs. T. J. Ryan, in
immaculate grey and white, her smart dove-
grey marocain costume topped by white fox.
Another inter-State visitor was Miss Coady.
from Melbourne, who wore a squirrel coat of
great richness.
Gladys Callaghan, of Gordon, and Geoffrey
Russell, of Killara, held their wedding on
their native heath, being duly linked at the
Methodist Chapel in Gordon one night last
week. Silver embroideries, a gold lame train
and ivory satin were the outstanding fea-
tures of the apparel of cue unusually well-
turned-out bride; and two small maids softly
frilled in pale-green and pink georgette, and
bride’s sister Irene and groom’s sister Elea-
nor, their greens and pinks heavy with
crystal, followed her sedately. Later, at the
Killara Memorial Hall, the bride’s parents
glad-handed many guests against a back-
ground heavily decorated with flowers and
bells and true-love’s knots.
Justice James led daughter Irene to the
altar of St. James’s in King-street the other
night. The dazzling wedding garment
achieved an effect of barbaric splendor. It
was formed of ropes of pearls twisted with
crystal and diamente mounted on white
georgette. This trailed a Sheba-like train of
silver tissue positively barnacled with rhine-
stones, pearls and silver strass; and a sort
of Catherine the Great head-dress —an
ascending silver half-moon laced with orange-
blossom—held the cut tulle veil in position.
A cascading bouquet of orchids, orange-
blossom and hyacinths was a finishing touch.
In the coolness of rock-melon chiffons made
with billowy skirts and tight-fitting bodices
stiff with pearls and rhinestones, Gloria
McFadyen and Grace Dettman followed the
bride. Waiting for her at the altar in
clothed but unadorned manhood was the
bridegroom, George Seaton, of Waverley.
Supporting him, virile but not gaudy, best-
man Otto James. Adrian Cnrlewis, neither
meek nor arrogant, but conscious of recti-
tude, acted as groomsman. Mrs. James, in
black georgette splashed handsomely with
silver, presided over the wedding-feast at
the Wentworth.
Another of the week’s bridal successes was
Elsie Wimble, of Ashfield, who became Mrs.
George Bennett, of Manly, by benefit of
Padre J. Russell, within St. James’s.
Knight Joe Carrutliers, whose “million
farms” are less heard of these dry days,
sealed his consent to the transfer of second
daughter Evelyn Noel to Basil Walker-
Taylor the other day. Evelyn Noel is much
more like an ornamental garden than a farm.
The young man, who is now of the Malay
States, is the eldest son of Canon Walker-
Taylor, of Orange.
Mary Dobell, of Elizabeth Bay, is plan-
ning her spring wardrobe to match her new
engagement-ring. It was presented by
Beresford Bruce Burge, son of Dr. Bruce
Burge, of Waverley.
This is a little picture of Dr. Alan Canny,
who has been the pride of the Sydney Medi-
cal School for the past six years, and who
wound up a brilliant course by alone gaining
high distinc-
tion in the
finals and win-
ning four of
the five prizes
open to men
students. Be-
fore he took
Medicine li e
did just as
brilliantly at
Sydney Gram-
mar, though
his old teachers
there will tell
you that it
was his thor-
oughness which
won him his
honors as much
as his bril-
liance. The
father who
has been shar-
ing the con-
gratulations is J. P. Canny, of the National
Bank, for many years Sydney manager of
the Bank of Queensland.
The new address of Australia’s High Com-
missioner will be 18 Ennismore Gardens.
General Ryrie will be the first of the line to
occupy the house, which has been the town
home of Lord Castlemaine. It is five storeys
high, but has an automatic lift; is 70 years
old, and one of a terrace with a private
park—Ennismore Gardens, near the South
Kensington Museum. The house has three
reception-rooms and a drawing-room 23ft. by
26ft., so the absence of a ballroom won’t be
noticed. It has been leased for 31 years for
£6OOO.
Memories of a lot of old history are re-
vived by the death of Mrs. Elizabeth Milson
Bligh at Carabella, Milson’s Point. Her
father was William Shairp, who arrived in
Sydney in 1826 and clerked in the Colonial
Secretary’s office; her mother was a daughter
of the man to whom all Milson’s Point was
granted, and on the land he gave as a wed-
ding gift Shairp built in 1829 the cottage
which still stands and in which the old lady
died. For a time explorer George Grimes
occupied the Carabella cottage, which in its
day was regarded as one of Sydney s best
residences.
The community of nuns at St. Joseph s
Mount Convent. Bathurst, lost their beloved
Mother Superior Mary Gertrude Sheehy the
other day. She was the only survivor ot the
seven sisters who came from the Charleville
(Co. Cork) Convent of Mercy in 1866 when
Dr. Quinn, Bathurst’s first R.C. bishop, de-
cided to establish a community of nuns in
his diocese; and she had been Mother
Superior for 30 years.
There’s no young man better known in
Sydney than “Johnnie” Pye, and a great
wave of sympathy goes out to him, for a tew
days ago his father slipped out of this very
good land he loved into the one that the
Bible claims is a better. For over 40 years
Charles Ward Pye operated in the Sydney
wool market, and as a very young man lie
had classed fleeces at Ryder’s station, Calga,
which he afterwards owned. The Ryders
were old friends of his father, David Pye,
of Waawaarawaa, Riverstone. This was
his birthplace; he was educated at Calder
House, Redfern, a celebrated school of oO
years ago run by Dr. Ely. The names ot
the stations he owned at various times read
like an abo. litany—Nebea and Culga, Dun-
numbral, Gingie, Curra-Willinglii and Ghool-
endaddi. Besides the popular John, those
left in sorrow are a widow, five other sons,
all on the land, and daughter Kathleen.
This girl with the Spanish type of face
is Muriel O’Malley, and she came from
Longreach (Q.). She won the Ethel I edley
travelling scholarship a year ago. For 12
months she
has studied at
the Royal
Academy and
gained her
bronze medals
for voipe —it
is a rich con-
tralto a n d
piano. Then
cal i ve a de-
spairing cry
from a very
sick father in
the Coast
Hospital, and
back rushed
Muriel a n d
he r mother.
The scholar-
ship is for two
years, with a
possible exten-
sion, so Muriel
hopes to re-
turn to London when her parent recovers.
Meantime she is raising her voice to enrich
the Apollo Club’s concert next Wednesday
at the Con.
An interesting visitor at the Lyceum Club
last week was Miss Lambrick, who has just
returned from her travels bearing a peace
offering. She was the Australian representa-
tive at the Peace Congress held in Dublin
last June under the banner of the Women’s
International League for Peace and Free-
dom, and after her vivid description of the
Dublin Congress and the spectacular arrival
of the Peace Pilgrimage in Hyde Park —
over 50,000 took part in it —something like
a sigh of relief was breathed by her listeners
in the cosy room high above Hunter-street.
At last it seemed Peace had her armies no
less renowned than War.
Dagmar Thomson preceded term holidays
at the Conservatorium by a night with her
violin, and her recital established her still
more firmly in her niche. In the Mozart
Concerto in E flat Lindley Evans was at
the piano, and the two players poured out
the wealth of their experience and technique
in a charming interpretation. But the Bach
“Partita” was perhaps the high-water mark
of the violinist’s performance, though two
new compositions, Andantino and Sclierzetto,
by Francois Rasse, and the “Capitan
Fraeassa” of Castelnuevo-Yedcsco, proved
gaily attractive.
Mrs. H. G. Anderson, who was Ella Mac-
Neil, secretary for 10 years of the Y.W.C.A.
World Fellowship in Shanghai, knows China
just about as intimately as the foreign devil
is allow r ed to know it. Her work has been
to a great extent among the women of China,
who, she reports, are showing great execu-
tive ability in carrying on the work of the
Y.W.C.A. Her husband, Dr. Anderson, was
on the staff of the medical school of the
West China University. So Mrs. Anderson
must be listened to with respect when she
speaks of the Nationalist movement as she
did last week at the Y.W.C.A.. where a great
brew of tea and music was dispensed in her
honor. From here the interesting couple go
on to Adelaide, where they will live for about
a year.
No longer will Ivambala, the old-estab-
lished girls’ school at Rose Bay, know its
popular principal, Miss Roseby. She last
week left Sydney by the Ville d’Amiens for
England. There she will join her sister,
who is doing research work at London Uni-
versity.
The Royal Rife Saving Society will now
be able to keep its head above water—in
answer to its distress signal a line of jazz
was rushed to its relief at the Ambassadors
last week. The Vice-reine brought a party,
which included the Major Longtield Lloyds,
anthropologist Radcliffe Brown, Helen
Anderson, in black moire and tulle, and Then
Proctor, in decorative blue and silver. Lady
de Chair wore green that sparkled with
rhinestones and liew shoulder drapes that
dripped into crystal vassals. A feather fan
and shoes to tone were gladsome addenda.
Justice James’s lady, president of the big
committee that had worked for the night’s
success, wore the black-and-silver trappings
that had made their debut at daughter
Rene’s wedding a night or so before, and after
murmuring welcome into the vice-regal ear
she sat surrounded by her husband, son
Otto, his fiancee, and - daughter Mrs. Copple-
son arid her doctor husband. Mrs. Ethclbert
Parker was secretary, and Mrs. A. G.
Thomas and Mrs. A. V. Roberts the trea-
surers. Mrs. Osbourne England organised
the money-raiser.
Brother John left Lena Garvan the
greater part of his private fortune, and
that helps to make her one of the richest
women in Sydney. She is the sister (there
were six in all) who remained at home with
her bachelor. The eldest and the youngest of
the sisters are married; the other three spend
their days between Europe and Australia.
Jeanette Ethelston, the Queensland
soprano, will give a farewell concert in the
State Conservatoriurr.' Hall on Saturday,
October 8. Then upstakes and take the track
for America, where she will make her debut
as a concert singer.
When Mark Sheldon’s lady returned to
Sydney after seeing her eldest daughter mar-
ried in London she did not expect a speedy
return to England. But tidings of the illness
of one of her sons caused an anxious mother
to hurry off by the Orama accompanied by
daughter Marcella.
The Feminist, the Women’s Service League
and other of the sex’s associations spoke
up by the velvet tongue of Ruby Rich before
the Film Commission the other day. Her
plea was twofold. It was for two makes
of movies—one for grown-ups, the other for
children —and for the Board of Censors on
which women should have a place. These
women representatives, she contended,
should be advertised for through the women’s
organisations. Women, the psycho-analytic
speaker pointed out, would make the best
judges of the subjects suitable for children.
This seems at last a definite step. Matinees
of which the programme consisted of Sheik
and Shriek drama are no better food for the
school-kid’s imagination than cocktails
would be for his appetite.
“Yale Blues” is the name given, not as
one might suppose to the agonised contor-
tions of the girl who, slightly elevated, fails
to stab the lock with her latch-key at two
a.m., but to the latest dance—a slow-moving
tiling, a sort of wedding of the original
Blues arid the Tango.
After his success in bringing home £4OOO
to Lucy Ada Sheldon last week, John Went-
worth Sliand is likely to be snowed under
breach of promise briefs. John Wentworth
Shand is a son of the brilliant K.C., and is
still only 26. Christian Martin Peterson, a
healers of sorts, is the man who will have
to find the money. How much of the £4OOO
he was ordered to pay for his perfidy and
how much by way of punishment for the
charges he brought against the lady perhaps
not even the jury could tell you.
The Spencer Bruntons are coming back
to their old home, Gladswood. A while ago
the Double Bay property passed into the
hands of a real estate company at the figure
of £45,000. Last week for £lB,OOO Mr.
Brunton bought back the house and its
immediate grounds.
“The Lilac Domino,” presented in the in-
terests of the Institute for Deaf and Dumb
and Blind Children, ran its melodic w r ay at
the Conservatorium on Saturday night. Rene
Maxwell again took the part of the
vivacious and cliampagne-bibbing Georgine,
and her acting and singing again made one
ask why we import third-rate American
musical-comedy stars while this attractive
creature blooms at our doorstep? Raymond
Ellis, a tenor with a voice like the waking
of spring, but whose action was considerably
impaired by brakes, was cast for the irre-
sistible Anglo-Frencliman who leaps into love
with Georgine. Elma Hardman was effec-
tive in the solo dances, and Arthur Leon
and Frank Leonard were useful; but the
support they obtained from the ladies and
gentlemen of the chorus was about equal to
the response Lauder might get from the
Pyramids if he invited them to join in “Just
a Wee Deoch and Doris.” Nathalie Rosen-
wax presented the opera, which was produced
by Alice Parkes and Ilughie Steyne.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite remarked
in a reflective way the other night that when
they were altering the prayer-book thev
might have changed it to “the blessed state
of holeproof matrimony.”

THIS is a practical book, written by a practi-
cal engineer. It is a complete, thorough ami
up-to-date treatise. It explains in simple
terms the underlying principles of thermodyna-
mics and the principles of operation of all types
of engines. The constructional features of the
engines and such parts as the fuel pumps, fuel
injection valves, starting and reversionary sys-
tems, air compressors, governors, etc., are all
treated in detail.
It explains the operation, repair and main-
tenance of Diesel engines, their troubles and
adjustments, indicator cards and engine testing,
fuel and lubricating oils, etc.
To-day the modern I )iesel engine is being used
extensively on shore and for the powering of
ships. Engines of as large as 111,000 brake-horse-
power are now being built. In the last live
years the number of motorships lias been almost
tripled and the world’s motorship construction
has grown to about 00 per cent, of the steamship
construction. Diesel-engined locomotives are now being operated at onedhird the
cost of steam locomotives. This is the only American book containing an
illustrated chapter on the application of the Diesel engine to railway ser-
vice.
The importance of the Diesel engine cannot be over-estimated and the pro-
gressive engineer will find it his duty to extend liis knowledge into the Diesel
engine field.
This book should be in the hands of every Power Station and Marine Opera-
ting Engineer as well as every Student of Mechanical Engineering, as it contains
data that are invaluable.
Its contents have been very carefully selected for the benefit of those seeking
real information, and it is particularly adapted for the steam engineer who is
preparing to operate Diesel engines, as it contains complete information
regarding the construction and operation of the Diesel engine.

Whiskey History
in the makind
b
One must back nearly 150 years to
arrive at the beg,inning,s of John Jame-
son Dublin Whiskey. Some time prior
to 1780, the first John Jameson sailed
from his native Scotland for Ireland,
and in those days travel was a hazard-
ous enterprise. But to John Jameson,
braving the journey across the Irish
Sea, proved a most fruitful venture. By
1780, not only had he acquired an
interest in the Distillery at Bow Street, Dub-
lin, but had established in it his two sons, John
and Wil iam. By 1800 the former controlled
the Distillery, and for three generations a John
Jameson has succeeded to the chairmanship of
the Company.
This close personal association of the Founder’s
family with the actual production of John
Jameson Whiskey is largely responsible for its
maintenance of the very highest quality stan-
dards over a period of nearly 150 years. It
was excellent in the days of George III. It is
excellent to-day.

At Moonee Valley on Saturday afternoon
the races were run in a freezing wind, with
alternations of sunshine and torrential
showers of rain and/or hail. Among a large,
well-wrapped-up crowd were the State Gov-
ernor and Lady Somers, she in a fawn skirt,
a jacquard-patterned harmonising woollen
jumper, checked hose and a lime-green felt
hat. Colonel Davidson’s wife was fur-coated
with a dahlia-hued felt hat. The Somerses
and their party, which included Captain Mal-
colm, were the guests of chairman Alister
Clark and the committee at luncheon, for
which the host’s garden, as usual, furnished
a fine floral display—on this occasion white,
feathery plum blossoms and daffodils.
Premier Hogan and his wife—she topping a
black coat with a delf-blue hat —were also
guests of the committee. Vice-Admiral
Napier’s spouse, clad in a tweed suit, furs
and a brown hat, had with her Kathleen
Currie, whose biscuit-toned frock was glimpsed
beneath a mole fur coat. Mrs. Lennox
Spiers sported a smartly-tailored suit of
navy blue, fox necklet and chic velvet mil-
linery. Mrs. Merson Cooper faced the
weather in a coat of kolinsky fur and mil-
linery of deep wine shade. Mrs. E. M.
Pearce was there to see her husband’s ex-
pensive. gee-gee, Avant-Courier, enjoy its
first win. Mrs. A. V. Kewney, the Elmer
Pauly couple, Surgeon-Commander Carr's
life-partner, General Chauvel, the Rogers-
Thomsons and Judge Williams were among
those whose sporting instincts overcame
the love of a cosy fireside.
The Harlequin Club’s hop at No. 9 was
one of the pleasantest dances of the season.
President Noall, vice-president Sampson and
Mrs. Sampson, she wearing black georgette
enlivened by a presentation bouquet, did the
honors. Among the dancers were Mrs.
Arthur Carnegie, whose pale-blue gown was
sprinkled with dewdrops; Aimee Shacked,
with a glow of pale pink beneath a black
lace robe; her sister Betty, handsome in
glistening white; Mrs. Bruce Atlee Hunt,
in old-gold velvet, and Lynette Henderson,
sheathed in gleaming mauve adorned with
heliotrope sequins. Biddy Tallis’s periwinlde-
blue georgette was made with a cape and
ended in a rainbow fringe, and Betty Shaw's
silver-and-mauve frock carried a bead fringe
of pink and lilac tones.
Journalists allied themselves with artists
for the purposes of a fancy-dress ball at St.
Kilda Town Hall on Friday night. For once
in a way it wasn’t a charity show, and
ticket-holders got their full money’s worth.
Decorations symbolised the Inky Way, and
the artists provided a gallery of posters
illustrating the journalistic life which in
some cases must have just scraped past the
Censor. The Firm’s wardrobe was ransacked
to provide costumes —Press and Stage are
usually good pals—and some of the dressing-
up was very amusing. One brave scribbler
impersonated the proprietor of his own jour-
nal, indignantly chewing the new journal-
ists’ log. It was, on the whole, an orderly
though very merry affair, and the policeman
who invaded the party and was mistaken
for one of the revellers evidently put in no
report about the commandeering of his hel-
met.
The Million Shilling Orchestra Fund
acquired some more silver recruits on Friday
night, when past and present students of
the Uni. Con. danced to help the cause.
Palms and garlands of pink blossoms filled
in the wall-spaces between the portraits of
great musicians, whose works, for once, were
not on the musical menu. Secretary Wini-
fred Mitchell, wearing gold lace over crim-
son, and treasurer Mrs. L. Booth, in black,
were office-bearers of the Old Students’ Asso-
ciation, the present-day students’ organisa-
tion being represented by secretary Marie
Magan, in an old-world frock of begonia-red,
and treasurer Ethel Forshaw, whose soft
covering was of apple-green. Others who
lent a helping hand were Una Ryan, in a
gown of cornflower-blue, and Ethel Seekamp,
who displayed sheen of silver and lettuce-
green.
Medical students of Alfred Hospital
invaded Ormond Hall on Thursday night
with minds intent on jazz. The matron, Miss
L. Mann, as a guest of honor, was given a
posy of crimson carnations to enliven her
gown of black satin and lace. Among the
dancers were Dr. John Kennedy’s wife,
whose black raiment glistened with crystal:
Dr. B. Corkill’s life-partner, in coral-pink
taffeta and floral additions; Dr. Marjorie
Hughes, whose amber-hued frock was traced
with gold, and Dr. Eric Aitchison’s helpmeet.
The nursing staff rolled up in force, discard-
ing their uniforms for pretty dresses of con-
siderably lighter weight and much brighter
colors.
Prof. Ernest Scott and his wife gave a
party at the Lyceum Club one night last
week, when the intelligentsia rallied round to
say good-bye to Prof. R. S. Wallace, who has
accepted a call to be Vice-Chancellor of the
Uni. in Sydney. Chancellor MacFarland pro-
duced a gold cigarette-case for the departing
prof., whose wife received a travelling-bag
and cushions of delicate grey hue —her own
particular color. The speeches were short
and flavored with pawkiness. Mrs. Scott
played the hostess in blue with adornment
of diamentc; a floral design in colored beads
sparkled beneath a blue and silver brocaded
shawl. Mrs. Wallace was enveloped in
clouds of georgette, misty and grey. Pro-
fessor Gunn’s helpmeet wore a frock of
lavender-blue with a ripple of glimmer about
the waistline. Mrs. Finlay, known profes-
sionally as Elizabeth Pinschof, sang a group
of old Spanish songs harvested during the
last tour abroad by Mrs. Scott, who played
the accompaniments. The singer’s apparel
was of white georgette with a beaded cor-
sage and a skirt enlivened with red and
silver. Stocks, sweet-peas and fruit blossoms
decorated the reception-room. Dr. Sugden
and his wife, the rector of Newman, Father
Murphy, the M. M. Phillips couple, Dr.
Gwynneth Buchanan, the F. W. Egglestons
and Dr. Constance Ellis were among the
guests.
Mrs. Ben Dawson, who is to accompany
her husband to America and Europe next
month, and her sister, Mrs. Graham Corn-
foot, who will cross the Pacific at the same
time, said their good-byes to many friends
at a bridge party at Menzies’ the other after-
noon. Spring-blossoms decorated the recep-
tion-room and tea-tables. Mrs. Dawson was
in crimson and black, her co-hostess wearing
a frock of black and beige and a jade-green
hat. The attire of Mrs. Dawson was black
with filmy lace additions, and Mrs. William
Cameron was a study in fawn and brown.
Mrs. Philip Glass. Mrs. Clarence Marriott.
Mrs. W. M. Robins and Alison Cummings
were "ues'ts. Sheila Buelian and Mrs. Neuen-
dorf were the prize-winners.
When the Junior Music-makers’ League
was formed to rake in some of the million
shillings needed to endow Melbourne’s per-
manent orchestra there was a hue and cry

When she is
not looking after her husband—lie’s well
known in the insurance world —a small son
and her home, she does her bit for good
causes. For some time past she has been
hon. sec. of the St. Ivilda branch of the
Women’s Hospital Auxiliary.
In the new show at the Athenaeum, “The
Last Warning,” modern frocks are featured
in three acts, while in the fourth the drop-
curtain rolls up to display costumes of 1780.
Louise Lovely, who has deserted the movies
for awhile, wears some very striking dresses.
One dress —it was made in Bourke-street —-
is of mushroom-pink georgette with a waist-
line glistening in floral design, topped by a
long, embroidered cape with a collar of
pink and lavender petals. Crystal and cherry-
red beads light up a white gown which is
worn with a wrap of crimson velvet. A
black satin frock has sleeves frilled from the
elbow to wrist in flesh-pink. Kerry Kelly's
three-piece jumper suit of apple-green is
most attractive, and equally smart is the
api-icot taffeta, partly concealed by a pea-
cock-blue cloak, that is her attire in the
last act. Dulcie Bland, whose many fi-iends
gave her a cheer, is charming in up-to-date
geranium-red covering that has touches of
gold. Her old-w T orld gown is of shot blue-
and-bronze taffeta. Doreen Griffen, who
stepped from the job of typist in the office of
the theatre to a similar role in the play,
shared in a generous blossom distribution.
Italian Consul-General Grossardi and his
daughter. Dr. and Mrs. Barry Thomson,
Biddy Tallis and the W. E. Bates couple
were among the first-nighters.
Tenor Joseph Hislop filled the Auditorium
on Saturday though the night was dark and
stormy and the wind was howling wild, and
he soon thawed a chilly audience into warm
enthusiasm that later manifested itself in
cheers. His operatic style of singing, with
its wealth of dramatic gesture and ever-
varying facial expression, made a big hit.
Our own fiddler, Leila Doubleday, shared the
honors. As she swayed to the rhythm of
the melody the ends of her rose pink and
green sash, draped upon a black lace and
gold frock, caressed her instep and the
sparkling adornment of her shoes. She and
the tenor shared an imposing pile of wreaths,
posies and baskets of flowers. In the audi-
ence were Dr. Ethel Osborne and her eldest
daughter, Dr. Aenone Bowman, lately back
from a trip to Ireland, Fritz Hart, Mrs.
Hart and son Basil, and Mary Campbell.
Mrs. Arthur Hordern’s smax-t coiffure lent
an air of distinction to the front rows.
Crown-Solicitor Clive Book, who is to
marry Zillali Roberts, of Castlemaine, this
week, was one of the listeners, and Rita
Hope and Katie Liddle helped to swell the
applause.
An indefatigable and resourceful worker
for good causes is Mrs. E. M. Pearce, wife
of the well-known sportsman, glimpsed for
this page bv a Lafayette camera. As vice-
president of the
Civil Ambu-
lance ball com-
mittee she has

nection with that institution's next ball,
which is to be held soon.
The attendance at Dorothea Macmaster’s
first pianoforte recital since her return from
England, on Saturday, suffered by the fact
that Joseph Hislop was first-nigliting just
across the street. The Assembly Hall plat-
form, with its altar-like background, was
grouped with arum-lilies and gumtips, form-
ing an effective background for the pianist's
gown of rose-red. The Governor and Lady
Somers, her Ex. in jade blue, paid a tribute
to Miss Macmaster’s talents by being present,
and were rewarded by hearing some very
graceful and poetic playing. Bunches of
pansies, daffodils and stocks mingled with
the arum-lilies when, after a double encore,
the Anthem was played.
The British Music Society’s concert on
Friday night deserved a bigger audience than
it got, though the weather teas wet. For
once in a way all the performers belonged
to the stockinged sex. The society’s string
four played the Mozart Quartette in D
major. Hilda Roberts, in black, w T as solo
pianist, and received some rare blossoms as
a tribute to her skill and artistry. Con-
tralto Victoria Anderson, whose coral-pink
gown was adorned with large embossed pink
flowers, and soprano Viola Morris, in spark-
ling green, were heard singly and in duo.
They will spend Christmas at sea, having
booked passages to Europe by the Maloja
sailing on December 20. Mrs. Harold Brown-
ing accompanied the singers. In the fore-
front of the listeners were Mrs. Percy Black-
bourn. Mrs. B. B. Barraclough, Lucy Rowe,
Francis Osborne and E. 11. Proekter.
The Girls’ Friendly Society’s show of
needlework and cookery at the Independent
Hall last week was well worth an hour of
any woman’s time. It was a competitive
affair, and crochet-bordered supper- and tea-
cloths, prettily decorated guest-towels and
toilet-mats made large classes. The five-
shilling frock competition was an eye-opener.
The winner was a girl who combined black
voile with white embroidery, achieving a
very smart effect. The cookery section paral-
leled that of any agricultural show —pre-
serves. jams, scones, nut-bread, cakes and
even home-made bread. That business girls
have aesthetic as well as domestic leanings
was demonstrated by water-color sketches,
pencil drawings and nicely-composed photo-
graphs.. Mayoress Morel! unleashed the
exhibition, with Archgaiters Lees as chair-
man. There was music and a play or two
at afternoon and evening sessions.
St. John’s, Toorak, which is the fashion-
able church for weddings, was decked out
the other afternoon with flowers of delicate
hue for the uniting of Margaret Ursula,
daughter of the late C. Fulbert Bere and
Mrs. Bere, of South Yarra, and Arthur Thir-
kell Price, who hails from Cobham, in Sur-
rey. The bride, who is well known in
tennis circles, was arrayed in white with a
pinkish sparkle of opalescent fringe and
embroidery, and the veil was of Limerick
lace and tulle. Vera de Bavay, who carried
an armful of gay tulips, was attendant ’maid,
wearing a floral-embroidered white frock and
a shady hat of white velvet and felt. At
No. 9 afterwards the guests included Bishop
Armstrong, who tied the knot, and many
members of the Staugliton clan, relations of
the bride.
The late Lewis Bell’s daughter Janet,
who lives with her mother on the family
. acreage, Murrnong, near Albury, has
arranged to slip quietly into matrimony on
September 29. Her cousin Alan Victor Bell,
son of the late Robert and Mrs. Bell, of
Dumfriesshire, Scotland, will be her partner,
and the knot will be tied at Murrnong.
Members of the Old Club of
the Methodist Ladies’ College, 120 strong,
gathered round violet-adorned tables at the
Rex on a recent evening for their annual
dinner, and later flocked to their
comfy headquarters in the same build-
ing to hear a report and elect office-
bearers. Mrs. L. V. Stephens, the retiring
president, wearing white with a gleam of
silver, Elva Ashton, editor of the Old Col-
legians, Mrs. L. Blanchard and Mrs. G.
A. Vasey—the last-named in a very striking
frock of flame tone —were chief speakers at
the feast. The secretary, Olive Dodd, re-
tains her honorary job, and Dorothy Kerr
takes the place of Agnes Murray as assist-
ant secretary. Miss Murray’s ' four years
of service are to be rewarded with a gold
badge. Mrs. E. E. Carter, the new presi-
dent, wore delphinium-blue.
Florence Johnson, who lately laid down
the secretarial quill of the Women Teachers’
Association, received recognition of her good
work one afternoon last week, when she was
handed a cheque for a hundred guineas. The
president, Miss I. K. Owens, Mrs. Melville
and Miss L. Kennedy spoke enthusiastically
of the way Miss Johnson had fought to
improve the status and salaries of members.
Maud Royden, now sailing over the ocean
in our direction, is an earnest figure in a
frivolous world. The daughter of a shipping
magnate, wealth opened the door to a well-
trimmed social position, but a little flutter
as a suffragette brought her in contact with
the women and children of the very poor,
and she decided to devote her life to helping
them. She has done it in a way that has
earned her respect and gratitude, and her
advice on social problems has been sought
by royalty.
Mrs. Willie Baillie and daughter Helen
have booked passages for Italy, taking in
Ceylon’s balmy isle on the way. A spell in
hospital and other troubles failed to cure a
taste for Australian sunshine ; and a return
visit is planned. Mary, the elder girl, who
went back with dad to continue her musical
studies, was a fellow-passenger with Pader-
ewski, who, hearing of her ambitions as a
pianist, invited her to play for him and gave
her a couple of lessons. The Baillies will
spend the winter in Rome.
Dr. Mona Blanch, who is combining plea-
sure and study in the course of a two years’
saunter over the Old World, has met many
Australians. At the Glasgow Children’s
Hospital she found Sister O’Rourke, who
left Melbourne Hospital for the Old Dart IS
months ago. At a medical conference in
Edinburgh Dr. Blanch foregathered with a
bunch of Australian medicoes that included
Prof. Howard Berry, B. T. Zwar and Eric
Gutteridge.
Professor Moore and his lady saw some-
thing of the U.S. and Canada on their way
to Europe, where he had to take a seat as
a delegate to the .League of Nations Assembly
at Geneva, After that he was booked for a
conference at Rome, where men of many
nations were to discuss the formation of an
International Copyright Union. The Moores
intended to do some entertaining in the City
of the Caesars.
Included in the autumn party at Henham
Hall, the Stradbroke country home in Suf-
folk, is Beryl Collins, who went abroad with
mother, Mrs. William Collins, of Beaudesert
(Q.), whom she will presently rejoin in Scot-
land. The Countess has been battling with
bronchial pneumonia. Even Victoria wasn’t
warm enough for her always, and the return
to Fogland has had unpleasant consequences.
Brigadier-General McCay’s daughter Beat-
rix, the barrister, who has had a grim fight
with pneumonia, is convalescing at Castle-
maine. But it will be a long time before
“Bix” will be able to use her powers of logic
and persuasion on a jury again.
Mary D. Glynne, a member of the British
Federation of University Women, has earned
one of the two fellowships offered by Dr.
Georgina Sweet to British and non-British
graduates for the carrying out of research
work in an Australian university. Miss
Glynne, who is a Master of Science of the
University of Wales, will probably investi-
gate causes of Australian cereal diseases,
Dr. Luise Charlotte Lammert, of the German
Federation, also a scientist, has been
awarded the non-British distinction. Her
line is physiography.


Choosing your motor-cycle
T\o you want a motor-cycle for solo riding, a
touring combination for one or two passengers,
or a sports machine capable of road speeds of 60-70
miles per hour ? Perhaps you prefer a lightweight,
easy to handle and economical in upkeep, or possibly
the extra power that a 6 or 8 h.p. machine will give
appeals to you. Maybe you require a commercial
carrier for your business.
Do you want your machine for town riding, amongst
heavy traffic, where good brakes, quick acceleration
and ease of control are essential —or do you have
to ride over rough, country roads where sturdy
construction and first-class springing are vital ?

The beautiful Queensland-maple table at
Government House was set one night last
week for a dinner party given by the
Goodwins. Pink and white azaleas from the
Government House garden figured in the
decorations. Amongst the throng were
Dean and Mrs. de Witt Batty, the beauti-
ful Mrs. Horsborough (Darwin), Mr. and
Mrs. Baramba Moore, Mrs. II 1 . Fairfax,
authoress Mrs. M. Forrest, Colonel and
Mrs. Campbell and Count di San Marzano.
His Ex. opened the Art Society’s exhibi-
tion at Wilkinson’s gallery this wviek, and
added his voice to our ceaseless cry for a
public gallery. Lady Goodwin and Colonel
and Mrs. Campbell were there. The
Governor spoke of Queensland’s sculptors,
Daphne Mayo, Harold Parker and W. L.
Bowles, and of the success of R. Cum-
mings in the realm of architecture.
Lady Goodwin, accompanied by Mrs.
Campbell, had morning tea at the Bush
Book Club, Mrs. Stanley Chapman (presi-
dent), Mrs. Firmin McKinnon and Mrs.
Arnold Gibson receiving and presenting her
Ex. with a posy of pink and mauve stocks.
Toowoomba is preparing for a visit from
their Exes. While in the Queen City of
the Downs the vice-regal pair will be the
guests of Dr. and Mrs. iEneas McDonnell
at Rath-Donnell.
Art posters adorned the walls at Lennon’s
on the night of the Life Art Club dance.
Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Lancaster, Daphne
Mayo and Mr. and Mrs. W. Bustard were
amongst the artists assembled.
Mrs. Firmin McKinnon, lion. sec. of the
State Council of the Bush Book Club, was
welcomed at the annual meeting of the
Ipswich branch by the president, Mrs. F. A.
Griffiths. The financial statement showed
a cheery balance.
News comes from England that Eddie
Cahill and the George Brookes will stay at
Petwood with Archibald Weigall and his
lady while Princess Marie Louise is their
guest.
In T’woomba Daisy Marshall, pictured
here by Fegan, married Frank Gordon Brad-
field, of Teneriffe, Brisbane. Palms, arum-
lilies and roses
dressed the
church, and
Bessie South-
er den sang
“The Wedding
Song.” Th e
bride wore old
ivory and gold
faille, and a
Limerick - lace
veil which is
an heirloom.
Hilda Donald-
son and Doro-
thy Bradficld,
in pink, were
bride smaids.
At So no ma,
Mr. and Mrs.
Marshall en-
tertained a
large party in
a setting of
Iceland pop-
pies, ranunculus, pink sweet-peas and 'white
rosebuds. As it was an evening wedding
there was dancing in the lounge. The bride
is one of the best-liked members of the
younger set and has been entertained at many
parties lately.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
We’ve had a Movie Ball at the City Hall
which produced the biggest crush seen here
for some time. There was hardly room on
the floor for the dancers, and the galleries
were packed with onlookers. Decorations
were in the form of banners advertising
various films, and between the columns hung
streamers and multicolored lights. Exhibi-
tion dances were given by Trixie Meech,
Joan Young and pupils of Beattie Jordan,
and T. Richardson’s pupils took the floor
for a Tartar dance. The prize for the best
pair was carried off by the Blakes; and
E. Read and Miss Linky, as characters from
“Monsieur Beaucaire,” won the costume
prize.
A good many birds were killed with one
stone at the Barracks the other day. There
was a welcome to the new Commandant,
Iff.-Col. Cox Taylor, and his wife; an
honors board, the gift of veteran artillery-
men, was unveiled, and the Mt. Schank
trophy was shown to the proud parents
of the winners. The O’Grady arrived with
a mounted escort of artillerymen, and
after he and a group of brass-liats
had taken the salute there were military
evolutions in the gun-park and a bite and
sup in the drill-hall,' where the Girl Guides
were kept busy at the tea- and coffee-pots.
The day was almost hot, but our spring is
not trusted by all, and the dressing, as is
usual at this time of the year, ran the
gamut from fur coats to summer frocks.
The Free Kindergarten fair at the Town
Hall was opened by his Ex., who was re-
ceived by a new sort of guard of honor —80
kiddies rigged out in all sorts of fancy
attire. The youngsters afterwards took part
in a parade organised by Mrs.. Baxter. The
principal figures were dressed to represent
the Ducal Yorks —Albert Windsor in naval
uniform, and his Duchess in a replica of one
of the costumes she herself wore in Hobart.
Parents, friends and relations came in thou-
sands, and hundreds were turned away. The
kindergarteners raked in over £2OO.
John Gellibrand and his lady, with the
family, have taken up temporary quarters
in Melbourne in readiness for the coming
Federal session at Canberra.
The Art Society lately made a show of
English railroad posters lent by the pro-
mising young Tassy artist, Harry Kelly,
who is rapidly making a name for himself.
Another Tasmanian who has made a success
in this special line in London is W. Ker-
mode, some of whose posters were repro-
duced in a recent number of the Studio.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
The wedding of the week which made the
biggest splash was that of Dorothy Gordon
and J. C. R. Bell, a ward of the Bell whose
lollipops have helped to make Albany famous.
Wesley Church was the scene of the fetter-
forging, and there were rejoicings afterwards
at the Karrakatta Club, where the head-
master of Scotch College was principal
toast-maker.
M i's. Fe r-
guson Stewart,

move ments,
and is a mem-

tertainment of
famous visi-
tors to our
city by the
club is always
entrusted to
her capable
managem e n t.
The Moulden
lady, of Adel-
aide, is a sis-
ter.
Another wedding which was expected by
the smart set to be a memorable social occa-
sion was that of Meg, eldest daughter of
Sinclair J. McGibbon, and “Buggie” Sum-
mers, a son of Horace Summers, one of our
foremost gum-diggers. But it was a quiet
and very private affair, and society didn’t
hear of it until it was over.
Dr. Gilbert Troup’s wife, who is one of
Perth’s prettiest young matrons, .has gone
with her baby daughter to spend the summer
with her parents in Melbourne.
News comes from Fogtown of the mar-
riage of architect Colin Ednie-Brown, of this
city, and Hilda Cox, also formerly of Perth,
which happened on August 3 in a Mayfair
church. They will make their home here.
The Pharmacy Undergraduates’ Associa-
tion, which includes a lot of girls in its
membership, held a cheery hop at the Y. A. L.
Hall the other day. All the leading pharma-
ceutical lights were invited, and most of
them arrived —and jazzed, too.
Jessie Mackay, of Fremantle, Claims fame
as the originator of a new sort of entertain-
ment —a golf party. There was play in the
morning and afternoon with a luncheon sand-
wiched in between and a prize-giving and tea
to wind up with.
Mrs. Farrelly, of Bellevue, Peppermint-
grove, whose main aim in life just now is
to raise funds to repair the Loreto Convent
tennis-courts, lent her commodious ballroom
for a dance the other day and thus enticed
many shekels. After that she engineered
a big bridge .party for the church funds,
equally successful from every point of view.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
With town given over to the solemnities of
feminine conferences and its inhabitants
emptying themselves into the country for
various back-to-the-home-village celebrations,
social life has been shorn of its glory and
we’re living an exemplary existence. Even
the Stonehaven visit has had no social rico-
chet, except for a small and informal dance
at Government House.
The G.-G. has been at Stratlialbyn, where
he lunched with the Lance Stirlings; and,
with Lady Stonehaven, he has glanced at
the more important towns between Port
I’irie and Adelaide. He has been to church
with his countrymen at Flinders-street,
lunched with the Commonwealth Club,
visited Scotch College, and received an
address from the State's Presbyterians. Her
Federal Ex. has supported Lady Bridges in
another good-bye at the Bed Cross annual
meeting. Our own Governor has been in th«
country, chiefly with the 11. H. Duttons at
Anlaby, whence he and his daughter joined
in the Back-to-Kapunda jollifications.
Substance has beer added to the coffers
of Toe. II by a bridge-party at the Went-
worth organised by half a dozen of our
younger matrons, including Mrs. R. J, Legoe,
Mr. W. A. Cave and Mrs. M. H. Forbes.
There has been money-making, too, for the
School for Mothers, which benefited through
a concert organised by Madame Delmar Hall
in a flower-embowered Town Hall. She
pressed into service the Con. staff as well
as its pupils, and the opera class’s cheerful
singing of the Gipsy Chorus, from the
“Bohemian Girl.” was a stirring opening to
an excellent programme.
The Girl Guides staged a fete, thanks to
Mr. and Mrs. George Morphett, in the pic-
turesque grounds of Cummins, and mus-
tered five companies strong, to do honor and
say good-bye to Lady Bridges. There were
side-shows as well as the usual stalls, and. in
th e smoking-room, a model of the Buffalo,
made from wood of the old ship, with Mr.
Dunn to tell stories of the State’s early
days. The final Guide good-bye will be said
a couple of days before Lady Bridges sails,
at Mrs. Charles Hayward’s home in North
Adelaide.
The week has brought us two engagements
—that of Phyllis, elder daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. F. Forwood, of Medindie. and a this-
season’s deb., to Ronald Orr, who hails from
Caledonia; and of the Robert Wemysses’
daughter to Carl, second son of the T. R.
Willses, of Malvern, Vic.
The Keith Bowmans have taken Bishop’s
Court for a month, and will be domiciled
there for the marriage of their eldest
daughter. Mary, to James Trafford, son of
the W. J. Cowans, of Conmurra, in the
South-East.

Democrat: Much obliged. Will have
it looked up. .. .C.D.8.: It has humor; but the poor
beast has been chased through too many stories....
0.D.: Glad to hear from you. But you go over
ground very well worked lately... .W.W.: Too
anaemic... .C.S.G.: Good idea there, but, as worked
out, too much like a conundrum.... Betty B.: Some
quality; but wants overhauling. Look at that last
stanza! J.K.8.: The main idea is too familiar.
....John O’H.: Keep to the boots. The “dummy”
is a commonplace intrusion.... Alex. A.: Make it
all as good as the last verse and we will hug it.
. ...I.VV.M.: Just misses; tuneful, but thin.... Bea
G. : A good idea in the second story ; but it is
presented in too amorphous a manner. .. .W.M.W.:
Can’t you plane out the lines that spoil it ?. . . .
Ariadne: All pleased, and yet all failed. You ought
to score 500 n.... P.R.T.: Not quite.... Eve M.: The
hills are too small M.8.T.: Not bad; but it is
superfluous to attribute “bird-like glee” to a bird.
There are other faults N.A.E.: Not enough grip
in the yarn.... Ina W.M.: Only “The Bush Road”
is on the right track. .. .S.R.T.: Wearily t01d....
C.M.: No chance of illustration.... Margaret W. :
Overwrought tragedy runs to bathos. .. .G.A.R.: Un-
suitable E.A.M.: “The Storm” blew itself out.
... .N.E.S.: Unsavory... .R.L.P.: Golf yarn stymied.
. ...W.M.S.: “Sea Diamonds” worthless De
Courcey L.: Only that we don’t know what it means
—or whether it means anything—We might have
used it. .. . 1t.E.8.: Well, yes; storms do stop....
Clare T.: Too painfully wrought. .. .Viater: You
miss the point J.M.K.: “Poets’ Prayer” con-
demned to —Heaven. .. .D.F.G.: Dreadful stuff. ...
S.L.J.: “Declined” is Margaret: Quite exhilarated
by the way you rhymed “sonnet” with “tables set.”
. . . .August: “The Sun, Great Nucleus of Light” went
down in its froth.... Sabi Rum D.: Worth a par.
only. . . .G.R.L.: Put more spirit in your “Water.”
. . . .F.J. Bow: The impossible never happens in Tiie
Bulletin unless it is interesting. And the im-
possible never is interesting unless it is made to
seem possible... .John D.: Appalling... .E.E. (East
Sydney): Decided improvement, but “The Black
Swans” wing back J.E.P.: That’s the last place
on earth we’ll give space to. . . .Rod M.: Might do if
made more convincing... .C.M.L.: “Broken Legs”
hasn’t a i leg to stand 0n.... A.C.T.: Trite.... Dan
0.: You’ve evidently been studying Stiffy and Mo. .. .
B. : “‘Enough!’ he hissed, malodorously. ‘Thou
shall be mine, or I shall wither thy beauty.’ ”
Scurvy knave! Private Plain: Right about turn!
March!.'.. .Marjorie M.: So much promise, we hope
to hear from you again. But why seek the deep
shadows —or the “cantle” in “Long Ago” ? That
one you could fix T.W.E.: Immature... .Lagani
W.: You’ve not schemed it out well. The verse is
all right J.H.C.: Tame your verse facility with
some compact thought. Lines which include '“with
joyous praise it greet” won’t do, anyway. . . .Rosa D.:
“Wouldst findest consolation —?” We couldst not.
B.J.M.: If you want to be friendly with the
Muse, fall off your high horse and take a walk with
her. . . .Bettie R.: Let’s have the idea again—in
better form F.M.P.: Religious spirit is willing,
but the verse is weak. . . .Bellerive: Your “Thrills”
made us even forget Lang for a moment: —
Frauds, robberies and violence,
Which in our papers appear,
Shock the gentle and pious
And fill the timid with fear.
Domestic Divorces and
Gay sport seeker’s capers,
And sidelights on races
Appear in the papers.
Big fires and explosions,
Grim rumors of War,
And mysterious deeds
Unveiled by the Law;
Political intrigues in
Far foreign climes;
Suicides, strikes and
Bold underworld crimes ;
Suburb affrays, strife,
Trouble and woe,
Are read in the papers.
As the days come and go.
... .A.P.R.: Can’t find a place to fit in mere descrip-
tive matter J.L-W.: Not in our line... .Bertha
V.: The style .is pretentious. Simplify it.... Jean
C. : The form you chose is occasionally very awkward.
... .C.A.T.: If you smooth it a bit, it might g 0....
J.H.G.: Old, old theme unimpressively treated....
Harold W.: Frail humor.... Lampros: Had to send
“Belinda” away....lda B.: Weak idea... .A.W.F.:
Peace should arrive more gracefully; she merely
flops in in those lines H.E.C.: Elephantine humor.
. ...Arielle: Even if the subject was worth while,
the staccato style would be its death warrant
R. : Not quite 8.L.R.: You pay twopenn’orth
of story in the £. Would you go to a theatre
where they occupied 90 per cent, of the time in
setting the stage? Dora B. : The introduction lags.
. . . . 8.8. (Wickham) : Verse breaks its neck in try-
ing to rhyme “winds” with “tends” and “full” with
“cool” Lon G.: We gave “The Dead” a funeral.
Ethel S.: All very amateurish —both verse and
story C.R.P.: If the tale was only one told to
you, why take half your space describing yourself?
....Bill O’B.: The padre does too much talking to
himself C.A.8.: Why waste space in assuring us
that the story is fact ? It can be as false as the
devil as long as it is as interesting. .. .E.F.W.: No
particular story in the tragedy... .F.R.R.: The
school of effort and experience is the only one to be
trusted. A little promise in verse; but it has
crudities E. Hoi: Description of a flood shouldn’t
be so dry J.S.G.: Are we supposed to blush?
Quis C.: Yes, we wrote all that 30 years ago—
acres of it. And it led to where we are now
C.G.: Sound but dull political pamphlet received.
Proposal to “restrict the opening of places of public
entertainment to three days a week and to necessitate
the closing thereof at 9.30 p.m.” referred to office

TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E. 8.: Slight in humor and penmanship J. 8.:
Lifeless R.S.: Not keen on your peg-legged pun-
ster P.A.F.: “A Prayer Before Meat” sagged
badly at the knees R.C.: Weird array of mis-
placed scratches H.E.C.: Time the gag entitled
“A Mutual Friend” was laid to rest.... S.A.: Joke
reads like a cross-examination in an Equity case. . . .
S. : The humor is spread too thin F.W.A.: On
a par. with average schoolchildren’s work. .. .8.F.:
We strained our optics trying to pick out ’Erb and

THE INKY WAY.
Akgus headline (B. 22/9/’27) :
The Lion and Her Cubs.
What about the Rooster and her Chickens?
“C. Cucliulain” : Randolph Bedford is the
first Australian writer to figure in the
Argosy, a sliort-story mag. brought out by
Cassell’s. He is represented by “Fourteen
Fathoms by Quetta Rock,” a diving tale, and
a good one.
"The Toad” : I went to the Age office to
collect on my first accepted contribution,
some 200 lines of copy. A clerk handed me an
account form to fill in and sign, at the same
time pushing across about 30 blank forms
for “future use.” That’s the sort of thing
that heartens a freelance.
“S.V.D.”: A district uncommonly well
supplied with local newspapers is Footscray
(Vic.). It has four— Mail, Independent,
Advertiser and Reporter —to serve 10.000
homes. And all four are read with avidity,
for they devote much space to football.
Footscray would rather let law and com-
merce, art and letters go than lose football.
“D.C.T.”: During Authors’ Week I re-
ceived a circular from a Sydney publishing-
house. The envelope bore the impressive
direction “Buy Australian Books.” 1 opened
it expecting to see a comprehensive list of
Australian publications, but it was the usual
list of overseas books. To every dog his
day, but not to every Australian author.
“Coot”: The collected poems of the late
Henry Tate are about to be published by
Edward A. Vidler. The volume is to have
an introduction by Elsie Cole, and will
include a poem of some length, hitherto
unpublished: “Aurora Australis.” Tate, by
the way, is buried in the same cemetery as
Adam Lindsay Gordon.
“Pip Tok” : Dramatic irony asserted itself
during the recent printers’ strike in Perth.
When the first unionist was handed three
days’ imprisonment for neglecting to pay his
fine, an official of the union called at the
police-statfon and asked to see the prisoner.
“What name, please?” asked the John iii
charge. The Trades Ilall Olympian disclosed
liis identity, only to be told: "I’m very
sorry, but we have a warrant for you also.”
And in he went.
“Glen A.” : It is a far cry to the day when
S. M. Herald first got excited over its cir-
culation (B. 22/9/’2<). Then the manage-
ment announced : “The advantage of adver-
tising in the Sydney Herald must be evident
to the public when they are informed it has
750 subscribers, which is considerably more
than any other Sydney journal, and the
prices for the paper and advertisements are
the lowest in the colony.” This appeared
in the third issue of the paper, May 9, 1831.
“II.II.” : The Bulletin pays for every-
thing. but I doubt if there is more than one
contributor who has received payment for a
single word. He is a brother of the late
Steve O’Brien (“Jack Shay”). His pars,
failed, but a word from one of them was
salvaged from the w.p.b.—it called the
Assembly the “Pledgislature.” (That was
in the days when members first gave a
written pledge to a party.) The author put
in a claim —and collected.
“Trampas” : A lad of 68 or so is footing
it briskly up and down the eastern coast of
this island. He is Harold Bruce Lewin, an
old inkslinger of Mudgee (N.S.W.) and a
friend of Henry Lawson; he first strolled
from Townsville to Melbourne, and recently
passed through Brisbane bound for Clon-
curry. Known in many country newspaper
offices, the old warrior has sub-edited his
requirements on the road to pipe, walking-
stick and notebook. He wants to be on his
feet when his hour comes.
“C.Q.”: Just how long can a newspaper
call its initial losses goodwill? The Morn-
ing Post, the Country party organ "mien
challenged the threeha’penny sheets in Mel-
bourne by coming out at a penny, lost
£4685 in 1925, £48.792 in 1926 and £48.42 1
in the last twelve months. Meanwhile it had
made a very lucky deal by buying the old
Herald building, and the handsome profit
obtained by selling that to a theatre syndi-
cate has reduced its total losses, but they
still stand at about one half of the paid-
up capital of £173,139. If the sheet can
afford to lose £lOOO a week for another year
or so, it may win out, for its hold on
Victoria is growing. One of its very produc-
tive circulation-stunts was a Most Beautitui
Waitress competition. Another was a cam-
paign for the foully oppressed Santel, an
imported wrestler whom the Stadium had
wickedly warned off the moneybags. Toon-
sands followed this fight for freedom as if
it were a contest between the White Knight
and the Dragon for the deliverance of the
fair Lady of Camelot.
“Pitman’s Boy”: During a particularly
rancid case heard in the Sydney Supreme
Court last week, Justice Ferguson remarked
that when he saw respectable young women
willing to “hire their naked legs to news-
papers for advertising purposes” he realised
that he belonged to a generation whose
ideals had become quite out of date. The
daily papers, with one exception, missed the
point, and turned the remark into a comment
on the “display of naked legs for the edifica-
tion of newspaper readers.” The exception,
curiously enough, was the Guardian, whose
“Miss Australia stunt” was pretty evidently
what ’Sonah had in mind. Over 40 years
ago, when the then youthful Ferguson was
a cub reporter, the prudishness of one of his
colleagues on the S. M. Herald supplied the
occasion for a jibe by the father of the
present Judge in Divorce. _ Charles Lyin’
had written an article which became the
foundation for the famous libel action Ander-
son v. Fairfax. The Herald briefed all the
prominent Common-law leaders, and the
plaintiff had to fall back on the Equity
Bar, with the result that Owen, who had
probably never addressed a jury before, man 1
a new reputation for himself at Common law.
In his address to the jury he mocked atLyn’
in a parody on a song from “Patience.” then
in the course of its first run in Sydney:
A most demure young man,
A modest and pure young man,
Who thought it so shocking
To talk of a stocking,
A Morning Herald young man.

r What
is the
Westinghouse
Light and
Power Plant
?
•
The Westinghouse
Farm Light and Power
Plant is a complete,
self-contained electric
generating pjgnt. 11
consists of a kerosene
engine, electric genera-
tor, and electric starter
and control. It also in-
cludes a battery in
which to store the elec-
tricity from the genera-
tor, ready for instant
use for light and power
purposes. It is neces-
sary, therefore, to run
the plant only when
the battery needs re-
charging.
With one of these
plants you can make
all the electricity you
need —for bright, cheer-
ful electric light in
every room of the
house and in the out-
houses —for power for
dozens of operations
both inside and outside
the house.
Moreover, this plant
is within the reach of
all, for it is as easy to
own as it is to operate.
Built by a world-famous organisation
especially for FARM USE! If
The name "Westinghouse” stands not only for one of the
world’s largest and most responsible electrical manufacturers
but also for the great organisation which originated radio
broadcasting, and which has been responsible for the elec-
trification of steel mills, textile mills, coal-mines, railway
systems, and battleships. Therefore, a farm electric plant
built by Westinghouse signifies a plant on which Westing-
house is willing to stake its valued reputation as being the
best that can be built for farm use.
You can depend on a Westinghouse plant, more than on any
other, for long life, economical operation and reliable service.

A large audience was given “The Last
Warning” at Melbourne Athenaeum on
Saturday. The mystery or muddledrama
opens in the dingy office of the Woodford
Theatre, N’York. (At this stage the audience
was just an ordinary first-night Melbourne
crowd.) The theatre has been five years
closed on account of a death that occurred
in the middle of a performance of “The
Snare.” Arthur McHugh is a detective, and
he sets out to unravel the mystery or crime
by turning producer and staging the same
piece. By one of those strange coincidences
that only happen to playwrights, practically
the same cast turns up to perform “The
Snare,” including the dead man. He makes
his presence felt by appearing at rehearsals
as a cat, and a spider, and a turning off of
lights, and a self-closing door, and a ghostly
voice protesting that none but he shall
ever play the leading role; and there are
other famous stage illusions. (In this act
the audience was supposed to be at the
rehearsal and therefore had to regard itself
as non-existent.) Despite the objections
of the ghost “The Snare” opens with the
cast tremulously expecting every sort of
trouble. (At this stage the Athenaeum tem-
porarily became Woodford’s Theatre, stage
policemen summoned in expectation of foul
play invaded all parts and blocked the exits,
girls in scarlet livery handed round fresh
programmes, and even the curtain bore the
slogan “Woodford’s Theatre.” The audience
thus became portion of the cast—in fact, was
asked to look on at itself looking on.)
* * * •
The reader must find the key to the ex-
citement himself. “The Last Warning” is
American in its ingenious devices, but it is
by no means as convincing a terror as “The
“LADY BE GOOD,” AT THE ST. JAMES
THEATRE, SYDNEY.
Dick (Leonard Rich) and Judy (Elsie
Prince) sing of a Swiss Miss.
Ghost Train.” It lacks the concentration
of its English prototype and its horrors de-
pend less on the psychological reactions of
the actors than the operations of the bloke
at the switclibard in the wings. Hence “The
Last Warning” is productive of more giggles
than hysterics, though the novelty of finding
themselves actual performers in a play
should fetch the sensation-seekers to the
Athenaeum doorstep for some time to come.
The piece isn’t the one- to display his-
trionic gifts to advantage, but Dulcie Bland,
in making her nrofessional debut, contrived
to be consistently emotional as the leading
lady, and Frank Bradley managed to be con-
sistently portentous as the manager-detec-
tive ; while Louise Lovely, as his masquerad-
ing wife, and Walter Cornock, as a stage-
hand, unpacked between them a not exces-
sively large bale of comic goods. J. B. Rowe
combined old-fashioned melodrama with the
new impressionism’, and little Kerry Kelly
characterised an ingenue with sincerity.
Actors being mortal, or at any rate sub-
ject to vicissitude, and “Abie's Irish Rose’’
being destined to live for ever, it was an
entirely new cast, with one exception, which
presented the piece at the Palace on Satur-
day. The exception was Jack Trainer, who
appeared in his original role of the slient-
per-shentimental Solomon Levy. It would
be difficult to think of Solomon Levy with-
out at the same time thinking of Jack
Trainer—and vice versa. The new mem-
bers were Rodway Gainford as Abie, Leslie
Adrienne as liis Rosie, Charles Zoli as the
moralising rabbi, and Alf and Sonia Gordon
as that incredible pair of stage Hebrews,
Isaac and Mrs. Cohen. Les Warton came
on duty as the Irish father. Once again did
the play triumph over its lamentable con-
struction and vamp a large audience with
its goo-goo sentiment.

With gestures indicative of a Presbyterian
elder taking round the plate, Joseph llislop
sang Beethoven’s “Adelaide” to a fully taken-
up if not over-subscribed Auditorium on
Saturday night. The song is of conventional
cut, though beautiful withal and exacting for
a singer. Ilislop’s singing is‘ not of the
Italian school. It lacks the histrionic throb.
Without being at all matter-of-fact, it has
a decent Scotch reserve about it. Its owner
is the master, not the slave, of his emotions.
He is also the same sort of dramatic artist.
He examines everything on both sides, bites
it to make sure it is genuine and spends it
with caution. In other words, he doesn’t
overdo things, and although, in ballads like
the pathetic and illogical tale of “Lord Ran-
dal,” he doesn’t sound the depths of tragedy,
lie_ at least produces workmanlike drama. In
this regard the present writer is inclined to
place the Scottish skald only a bit below
Chaliapin ; of course, he has not the Russian’s
monumental bass, or his monumental figure,
either. Hislop’s voice is a vagrant tenor,
whose full volume is of good loud-speaker
strength and whose pianissimos are not more
than .0001 p.c. above silence. Leila Double-
day, the Melbourne violinist, completely drew
out the lingering sweetness of a Grieg sonata,
and Mr. Sciarretti ably assisted at the grand
piano. Joseph’s programme on Saturday,
with the exception of the items mentioned,
had its eye exclusively on the bawbees, and,
judging by the wtiy the audience sounded the
pibroch of appreciation, those useful counters
should be forthcoming.

At her recital on Saturday night at the
Assembly Hall Dorothea Macmgster showed
how much she has profited by her recent
study in London. Naturally a sound pianist,
with a keen sense of rhythm, she has de-
veloped breadth and expression. A first per-
formance in this city of the Prelude, Arie et
Finale of Cesar Franck naturally had first
place, and like all this Belgian's composi-
tions was, above all things, melodious. The
Beethoven Appassionata Sonata, a group of
pieces by MacDowell, Poldini and John Ire-
land, with Chopin’s Ballad in A flat, made up
a well-rendered programme, and there were
several extras. Galbraith Donald, a tenor
who was handicapped by a cold, contributed
a trio of songs by Australian composers,
including “To Plectra,” by Fritz Hart.
“Before the Dawning.” by Lala Trinca, was
another likeable offering, with George
Stephen at the piano.
The drought hasn’t reached Melbourne
Majestic, where that hackneyed film prop.,
the busted dam, has been flooding the screen
twice a day for a fortnight. Last week the
Hollywooden Burrinjuck burst of its own
accord; this week it is dynamited and flows
over Patsy Miller. “Hell Bent fer Heaven”
is the elegant title of the piece. There is
some hardy lying going on in the vicinity of
Hoyt’s, where children over 6 and under
16 are not admitted to “Tilly the Toiler.”

Frank Neil’s comedians will proceed about
the business of “Getting Gertie’s Garter” on
Saturday at the Palace. Otherwise the Mel-
bourne theatrescope remains in statu quo,
though it is expected to get restless later
on, as “Cradle Snatchers” at the King’s and
“Tip Toes” at the Royal hurry or lim'p to a
conclusion. At the Tivoli Hetty King con-
tinues to dress herself up as various sorts of
males, and the Briants are back again with
their pantomimic turn, which for once jus-
tifies the misused appellation “brilliant.”
These two stationary gentlemen, by the way,
were ordinary acrobats until they made the
discovery that by doing nothing with intense
deliberation for half an hour they saved
themselves a lot of perspiration and tickled
their audiences twice as much.
A Melbourne Art rash:—
Those who consider that the chief function of art
is to avoid clashing with a vieux rose wallpaper
will not approve of Laura Knight’s water-colors at
the Fine Art Gallery. The lady, an Englishwoman,
caresses life with a currycomb. She refuses to
accept the version of themselves which actors pro-
ject over the footlights, but goes behind the scenes
into their dressing-rooms and disrobes them with her
pencil. Her rough vitality is a tonic in these senti-
mental days which is not to be despised.
Color and light have been warned off the land-
scapes of E. Kimpton at the Sedon Galleries, and a
painful literalness afflicts his forms. His is the prose
of the Meldrum school, and a whole show of him
is as exhilarating as a meal of damper washed
down with draughts of barley-water.
There are no sharp edges in Clarice Beckett’s world
(Athemeum Hall), yet her viewpoint is sharply indi-
vidualistic. She seems to look at nature through an
unwiped windscreen; but if you like to take your
seat beside the driver and look through the wind-
screen, too, she will lead you through country of
considerable charm. If you accept her angle of vision
you will find all in order. Her planes are right,
her tone-values good and her composition smooth and
satisfying. She has the courage of her convictions,

which include the belief that telegraph poles are sub-
jects for pictorial treatment—she proves it, too, in
several canvases. Her atmospheric still-lifes are

The Players’ Club was the medium through
which Judge Beeby’s play “Merely Mar-
garet” was transmitted to Sydney audiences
in St. James’s Hall. Maybe the transmis-
sion was a bit blurred, but the comedy seemed
just about as coherent as most of the mes-
sages passed on through an ouija board.
“Merely Margaret” contains four acts of
platitudes that sound as though they are
trying to be epigrams, with an underlying
idea that should make a rollicking one-act
farce. The plot revolves around an anthro-
pologist (he might have been a greengrocer
or a herbalist as far as his calling affected
the play), Professor Leonard Hurst, who is
suddenly confronted with the wife of his
early youth. He had thought her dead and
has married again. No. 2 wife is blooming,
No. 1 faded. The idea of going back to
No. 1 is so intolerable that Wormwood
Scrubs seems preferable. The Professor
wanders off stage, face set toward London,
to give himself up to justice. Meanwhile
No. 2 wife burgles the cottage of her alleged
predecessor, and finds that lady is merely
said predecessor’s sister. The play has none
of the fine craftsmanship the author showed in
a previous piece, and the acting was uncon-
vincing. Nell Woodgate, as wife No. 2,
spoke her lines pleasantly, but was rather
colorless. Florence Gourlay made Martha
the maid unnecessarily unattractive; Carrie
Shield portrayed wife No. 1 cleverly, but
in somewhat irritating tones. Of the lot,
the palm goes to producer S. R. Irving in
the role of the jolly, gullible doctor.

The Gilbert and Sullivan season in Sydney
ends to-morrow (Friday) night, when the cur-
tain falls on “The Mikado” ; on Saturday the
company will produce “The Chocolate Sol-
dier” at Her Majesty’s, where the dainty
warrior will be kept on view for 11 nights
only. The hosts of patrons who still fill
the Royal to be thrilled by Moscovitch and
mystery in “The Ringer” are staving off the
projected change ; “Our Wife” humorously
learns how to fall in love with her own hus-
band nightly at the Criterion ; and the group
of spirits sails “Outward Bound” at the
Palace before full houses. “The Student
Prince” will conclude his romantic career
at the Empire at the end of next week; after
that “Tweekie.” said to be an engaging young
lady of the Cinderella class, wall flash her
crystal shoes at the Railway-square address,
commencing on October 12. The theatre-
goers who dine in masses and like light
theatrical fare served with song-and-dance
afterwards seem to find “Lady, Be Good” to
their taste, for a sequence of massive theatre-
parties—affairs of societies rather than
society—have been swelling the ordinary
audiences. “A Little Bit of Fluff” lies
lightly on the conscience of the Grand Opera
House management, and will last out the
Nellie Bramley season. It has a mere few
weeks to run, Frank Neil with “The Gorilla”
being due back next month.

A show that introduces itself on Wednes-
day night has to wait a week for this Show-
man’s opinion; but the good work the little
Playbox Theatre in Sydney has already
done entitles it to a mention that Frank
Wedekind’s “Awakening of Spring” was due
for staging last night. The play is con-
sidered the masterjtiece of an eccentric
genius who leads the new school of German
playwrights which has superseded Suder-
man and his compeers. It is to be repeated
on each Wednesday night up to the first
week in December.

The story of “The Seventh Heaven,” pro-
duced in Sydney 15 months ago at the
Theatre Royal, gets a rather larger scope in
the screen version prepared by the Fox
Films people which was given a private screen-
ing at the Prinee Edward Theatre on Tues-
day morning. It is a good straightforward
story without any of the superfluous frills
usually associated with American films, and
benefiting greatly bv the introduction of
some really well-worked war scenes and the
elimination of some of the irrelevances or
side-issues in the original play. Janet Gay-
nor’s very sincere work as Diane, who
climbs to her heaven on the seventh floor of
a poor tenement, is largely responsible for the
heart-throb of a good picture which some-
times skirts the edge of bathos but never falls
into it.
* * * *
“Mons” is a better war picture than
“Ypres” ; the elements of humor which burst
through the dark war clouds lend it a
human interest, intensifying the heroic
tragedy of the main subject. There is also
a refreshing absence of the usual exaggera-
tion in the portrayal of the magnificently-
trained army. The picture is at Hoyt’s.
The tender passion which the film producer
finds such an asset is much in evidence at
Sydney Lyceum, where the main exhibits
this week are “The Love Thrill” and
“Love’s Greatest Mistake.” Evidently some
portions of the mistake were too strong for
the censor, who has made such a hash of
the film that it is hard to sort out the
matrimonial relationships of the characters.
“Ben Hur” begins to give hints of an
impending change. “The Term of His

Another native Australian who had to go
abroad before he could secure a market for
his talent at home is the kangaroo now
appearing at Sydney Tivoli. After lie had
become a Holywood animal star, his trainers
decided to repatriate him for a vaudeville
turn. As an exponent of the fistic art the
marsupial is not in the same class as the
boxing kangaroo which once achieved a world
fame, but his habit of tossing his head aside

performances, Stiffy and Mo will enter upon
their farewell week at Fullers’ Sydney Theatre
on Saturday; Jim Gerald is to fill the gap
when they depart. However rough their

The Royal Agricultural Society’s Spring
Fair got moving on Tuesday with every pro-
mise of attractiveness. The spring festival
naturally cannot rival in its general exhibits
the one that comes with harvest time and
autumn ; but for the horse events the society
gathered in all the well-known performers,
the woodcutting champions hailed with joy
the chance of extra prizes, and the bands, as
this paper was getting ready for the book-
stalls, had massed their instruments of brass
for an assault upon the Jericho of a £5OO
contest. The flower show—which might easily
become the premier affair of its kind —was
made slightly disappointing by a season
badly mismanaged by Mr. Mares; but the
dog and cat shows have an unimpaired
interest. The best days (and nights, too)
will be Friday and Saturday, when the finals
of most of the contests take place.

A show for the home decorator:—
The picture-seeker with little money to spend has
a good opportunity at A. H. Fullwood’s show in
the Fine Art Gallery, Sydney. Fullwood seems to
have had the thin purse in mind in painting for
this exhibition, which shows, nevertheless, a delight
in agreeable color harmonies. Two of the bigger
pictures are stark in conception, although “Wise-
man’s Ferry,” the largest, has the haze of a sunny
day nicely suggested ; but the really pleasing things
are in the smaller frames —“Balmoral Beach,” “Wen-
dover” and “Smiling Morn,” for instance.

the walls of the Grosvenor Galleries, likes to cateli
his views in a haze —either of stark heat or of
shrouding mist, which will make indefinite the edges
of the harsh-edged things that go upon his canvases.
It is a cheerful little show, which runs to a few
big pictures, “From the Mountain Slopes,” “Hazy
Summer” and “Over the Rosebud Plains,” in which
far distance is well expressed. “The River Bank”
gives a pleasing tranquillity to the fall of evening;
and “The Inn on tha Epping Road” is a sunlit subject.
Knox, although he has fewer of them than of old,
clings to his old love for the small sailing-vessels that
find a sanctuary in the Yarra ; one of the boats gives
a lopsided impression. These pictures have their
appeal, too.
Trees smudged over with Paris-green foliage and
standing against dark purple skies are among the
products of Arthur Baker Clack’s brush to be seen
at the Macquarie Galleries. The painter is a South
Australian who forsook journalism 20 years ago to
go to Europe and (it is said) study painting. Three
wash-drawings show capabilities, especially the study
of a “Fisher Girl.” Elsewhere the painter seems to
have aimed at originality first and foremost, and in
just a few canvases—“ The Road to the Mill” and
“The Quay, Etaples,” for instance —with some success.
Other pictures merely leave an impression of stark
ugliness.

“Rose Marie” finishes at Adelaida Theatre
Royal on Saturday. Of all the cast Yvonne
Banvard has stood the strain best, and her
“Lady Jane” has been one of the brightest
features of the show. At the Prince of
Wales Muriel Starr is sending thrills down
numerous spines as Madame Mysteria in
“The Hole in the Wall.” Muriel starts as
a fake medium, but presently the real
spirits take a hand and enable her to get
to some fine work in a dim light. At the
Wondergraph, “The Love of Sunya,” with
Gloria Swanson in the title-role, is the
screen version of “The Eyes of Youth,” with
which the late Emelie Polini familiarised
Australian audiences. “Alias the Deacon”
presents a somewhat unusual type of elder
who takes down the whole village at poker.
At the Majestic, the Stud Foley Follies are
in their last two weeks with a potpourri of
music, song and dance. At the Grand, Tom
Mix and Billy Sullivan are featured to
advantage in “The Broncho Twister.”
And Wirths’ Circus has t arrived on three
special trains.
“L.H.P.”: After sundry London engage-
ments Walter Bentley landed on his feet as
juvenile lead with Irving at the Lyceum.
As Clarence in “Richard III.” he made such
a hit that the star got him sacked. Bent-
ley’s aunt, Miss Faithful, financed him in
a season at Edinburgh, where he played
“Hamlet.” Then he retired to the highlands
for study. On returning to the stage, he
formed a company for classic drama, and
toured the U.lv. for 12 years. Then, by
arrangement with Wilson Barrett, he went to
U.S.A., where he created “The Silver King”
in every big town, bar New York, Chicago and
’Frisco. He returned to England to appear
as a co-star with Adelaide Ristori (here in
the ’seventies) in “Macbeth” and “Queen
Elizabeth.” This was under Teddy Saker’s
management. Back in Australia, he was
under contract to George Coppin in 1891.
Laura Flansen was the leading lady.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: On September 10 Her
Majesty’s in Sydney celebrated its fortieth
birthday. The opening was under the pat-
ronage of Lieutenant-Gov. Darley and a full
bench of Judges—they are all dead. George
Rignold played “Henry V.” With him were
J. R. Greville, as Pistol; Jimmy Hazlitt, as
Westmoreland (he was s.-m. also) ; Charles
Holloway, as the Archbishop of Canterbury;
Stirling Whyte, as Sir Thomas Erpingham ;
J. W. Sweeney, as Macmorris; C. R. Bailey,
as Fluellen ; Teddy Corlesse, as Bates ; Frank
Harcourt, as Bardolph; Charlie Berkeley,
as the Duke of Orleans; and Harry Douglas,
as the herald Montjoy. The Princess Kath-
arine of the production was Athena
Claudius, and Annie Taylor played Dame
Quickly.
Poverty
Point
THE STRING TO IT.
TTHE ARTIST: “Yes, she is a pretty old model; but she can stand still for hours.”
THE MODEL: “Yes, those old models do that. But be careful —they won’t always go
when you want them to.”
“,C. Boy” : Melbourne Athenaeum continues
to provide harborage for Australian actors.
The second division of “The Ghost Train,”
which departs shortly from that theatre
for Gippsland, will be manned entirely by
the indigenous mummer. Australians in its
successor, “The Last Warning,” include
Frank Bradley, Walter Cornock, Louise
Lovely, Dulcie Bland, Kerry Kelly, Doreen
Griffin and Austin Milroy. That cast
should satisfy all purposes except grand
opera.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Williamson programmes
have gone up to sixpence. The Firm pub-
lishes a magazine—practiically all “puff”—in
which you track down the programme of the
show. No kick will be made by the public.
The first attempt to charge for programmes
in Sydney, however, failed completely. Asked
to pay 3d. for what had previously been
free, the audience declined enthusiastically.
Instead it amused itself during the piece by
peevish conversation on these lines: “Who
is he?” “I don’t know. I haven’t got a pro-
gramme.” A special advertisement next day
• announced that the charge for programmes
was off.
“Hamfat” : Bourchier had an interest for
Australians in that he staged Arthur
Adams’s “Mrs. Pretty and the Premier.”
“Mrs. Pretty and the Premier” may not have
made a fortune, but it at least did some
pioneering. The production was staged at
His Majesty’s Theatre in January, 1916.
“Kay”: When the Firm puts on “The
Cuckoo in the Nest” it will not be the play's
premiere on this side of the line. The comedy
was played about four years ago by a com-
pany of amateurs at Ocean Island, a tWo-by-
four speck in the Central Pacific. The late
R. McClure, then Commissioner for the
Gilbert and Ellice Islands, was largely
responsible, and the performers were re-
cruited from the Government staff and
employees of the Phosphate Commission. _ A
chance remark set McClure to dramatising
the book, and the whole thing was adapted,
written, produced and played within a week.
“C. Ockney”: The late Arthur Bourchicr
was to have come on from S. Africa to Aus-
tralia to appear here in “Treasure Island”
and other plays with which he has been iden-
tified in late years. Though never in the
first flight of English actors —there was
always something self-conscious and aggres-
sive in even his best impersonations—Bour-
chier was undoubtedly one of the most
talented mummers the English Universities
have produced. He was especially commend-
able in Shakspearean roles. Ilis “Henry
VIII.,” with Tree, was the best thing he ever
did.
“C. Ockney” : Joseph Coyne, at the age of
00 and a bit, continues his gambols in musi-
cal comedy in England. The veteran, having
recently concluded a long run in “Queen
High” (shortly to be seen here) at London
Queen’s, is now preparing for the production
of the latest Wodehouse-Gershwin frivolity
called “Oh, Kay” at His Majesty’s. Joe
is to be, as usual, chief comedian.
“Cauboy”: St. Kilda Council started an
uproar the other day about the Health
Commission prohibiting smoking in buildings
used by both sexes. In St. Ivilda smoking is
allowed in the auditoriums of theatres, with
the result that the stage gradually disap-
pears behind the barrage of vapor and
becomes invisible about the middle of the
second act. Actually the prohibition doesn’t
extend to foyers, where anybouy can soothe
his or her nerves between the acts. Keeping
the pipe and cigarette out of the insides
of the theatres, including the back of the
stage, is a commonsense precaution. Still,
official Melbourne’s attitude towards man’s
and woman’s solace is curiously irrational.
Smoking is still forbidden in the public
gardens, one reason given being the danger
to shrubs and trees from carelessly-thrown
lighted matches.
“Old Unionist”: Memories of Australia’s
first Actors’ Union are revived by the death
of Walter Bentley. The companies encour-
aged the formation of the Actors’ Association
as a counterblast, and guaranteed Bentley's
salary as secretary. The union’s main plank
was “the Australian stage for the Aus-
tralian mummer,” and Bentley’s action was
regarded as a betrayal. After the union had
been crushed its members joined the asso-
ciation as a body, bided their time and, by
a sudden move, changed the executive and
reconstructed as a union.
“W. Spokeshave”: Theatrical manager
John Fanning entered his nefarious trade in
1877, when he took “D’Arcy Reid’s Ghost” to
Adelaide. Fifty-one years later he returns to
the same city with another collection of stage
spooks, “The Ghost Train.”
“L.”: When Walter Bentley played “The
Silver King” for J. C. Williamson he got
£75 per week. He toured Australasia with
his own companies. His best-remembereu
roles are Hamlet, Sliylock, John Storm in
“The Christian,” the Bailie in “Rob Roy,”
Jock in “Cramond Brig,” the Burgomaster
in “The Bells,” Richelieu, Evelyn in
“Money” and John Mildmay in “Still Waters
Run Deep.” In Maoriland he made a hit
in 1894 as the Dean in “The Silence of Dean
Maitland.” and also scored as lead in
“Friends,” a version of Sardou’s “Nos
Intirnes.” When he played 'Wilfred Denver
in “The Silver King” in U.S.A. he got 250
dollars a week, a black servant, a sleeping-
car and a carriage between the stations and
the theatres.
“Goldilocks” : The shuffling of actors from
company to company is part of the game.
But the Firm is not responsible for the pro-
cession of Dengleys in “The Ringer.” Michael
Hogan, who first played the part, went back
to America from Maoriland. Raymond Law-
rence. who opened with it in Sydney, also
went back to the States. Ronald Ward,
having finished up with the Renee Kelly co.
—Renee Kelly has returned to England—
filled in until he was wanted for the opening
of “Outward Bound” at the Palace. Jack
Mayer, who was one of the slave-lovers in
“The Road to Rome,” took over from Ward;
but he also is due elsewhere, and there may
be a new man in the part before the Sydney
run finishes.
“Stellsby”: Concerning the lion that
escaped from Melb. Tivoli stage (B.
15/9/’27). On his way out Leo popped his
head in at the stagedoor-keeper’s box. For-
tunately he was more inquisitive than
hungry. The terrified Cerberus was ex-
actor Harry Daniels, who died at 85 in Mel-
bourne three years ago. Old Harry never
wearied of telling the story.
“Tenakohe”: When long Victor McLaglen
came to Sydney 20-odd years ago he intro-
duced himself as the son of a London bishop;
he certainly was no Maorilander (B.
15/9/’27). In the first fight at the Gaiety
a foot-shorter opponent smote him where his
alleged papa wore his apron; and Victor
refused to get up till the referee (Jim Bar-
ron, I think) had disgustedly counted him
out. McLaglen drifted into the pictures in
America easily enough. He was splendidly
proportioned, and had a handsome face.
“Cauboy” : The Firm has broken out in u
new spot. Leslie Board, its scenic artist,
who has been looking at the way they frame
grand opera at La Scala, ran over to the
Paris Salon and took away 40 pictures. They
will be hung in the J.C.W. vestibules, and
there will be more to follow.
“Hamfat” : G. P. Huntley’s first visit to
Australia with the George Edwardes company
in 1903-04, although brief, so established him
amongst theatregoers that his failure in
vaudeville a few years ago was a heavy dis-
appointment. But the man who at his best
was an artist amongst actors had suffered
from the years. He started on the stage
with his parents when he was a youngster of
six. As a boy-actor he made a reputation
which took him from the provincial show of
dad and mum to the London Adelphi; and
he made his big hit as Lord Plantagenet in
“Kitty Grey.” Huntley was a racehorse-
owner, amongst other things, and had fair
success on the turf. Pie passed out recently
at 59.
“P'laming Youth”: Dot Brunton’s personal
success in “The Climax” at the London Little
Theatre has not saved it from failure; the
withdrawal of the play after a mere 30 per-
formances indicates that keeping it on must
have been hopeless. The failure is sur-
prising ; at the Sydney Palace the play ran
from July 3 to August 19 last year, the
going being so good that the company cut
out arrangements to appear in Melbourne
and even chased along the overland route
to catch the boat to overseas. The theatrical
business is full of surprises.
“Hamfat”: “The Awakening of Spring,"
with which the I’laybox people have re-
placed “Juno and the Paycock,” was the
first of Wedekind’s works to make his name
known beyond Germany. Brutally frank
as it is, it does not reach the usual brutality
of the man who regarded life starkly and
thought that anything he saw in it could be
put into words. Wedekind was born in
San Francisco, but his parents (the father
was a rebel of 1848 and his mother an
actress) did not stay in the New World.
His early plays were full of bitter satire.
An action for lese-majeste made him fly to
Paris, and returning to Germany he suffered
imprisonment at Koenigstein. Subsequently
he appeared on the stage in his own pieces.
“The Old Adam” : It seems to be forgotten
that “A Little Bit of Fluff,” now being
done by the Nellie Bramley company at
Sydney Opera House, was originally pre-
sented 10 years ago on the selfsame boards.
The principal parts were then played by
May Edouin, Percy Marmont (now one of
Hollywood’s film stars), Thomas Braiden.
Eardley Turner and Carrie Moore — the Aus-
tralian comedienne’s last professional appear-
ance. The English farce —quite as funny as
nine-tenths of the American importations—
did not then get a fair run. The big railway
strike flared up in its second week and
wrecked its chances.
“Minto”: Bad casting, indifferent titling
and disinclination of producers to consult
with the author when making a picture
account for many failures in locally-pro-
duced films. A producer set out to deal
with a story of mine. When he had finished
the titles had a flavor of the Mulberry Bend
(N.Y.), the heroine resembled a Hollywood
vamp, and in place of a large, hairy beach-
comber who should have dominated the
screen was a bald-headed gent, who might
have passed anywhere for a curate. A factor
which contributed largely to the success of
“The Sentimental Bloke” was C. J. Dennis a
insistence on his verse being used whenever
sub-titles were necessary. That did away
with the risk of indifferent titling and mad“
the producer keep to the story. Dennis had a
say in the casting also, and, being in a posi-
tion to make conditions, got a fair represen-
tation of the original theme.
“T.P.O’C.” : “The Chocolate Soldier,” with
which the Gilbert and Sullivan co. concludes
its Sydney season, was first done in Mel
bourne in 1910 by Clarke and Meynell, then
fighting J.C.W. for theatrical supremacy. It
took the Yarra town by storm, running for
10 weeks —-an achievement in those days.
It was produced later in Sydney under the
J.C.W. banner —the rivals having amalga-
mated in the meantime. The Strauss composi-
tion left Sydney cold, and revivals of the
piece have aroused no particular enthusiasm.
“Hamfat”: “The Romance of Runnibede"
is a proof that Australian films can be made
at a price which gives them a chance in
foreign markets. The Phillips Films people
say that they can produce similar pictures
for less than £lO,OOO. Handicaps of the
Australian film have been the heavy cost of
keeping a large body of white actors “on
location,” the film-spoiling efforts of amateurs
impressed into scenes and the tendency to
economise instead of retaking scenes until
perfect. In the version of Steeele Rudd’s
story there is only a small paid cast —the
picture is made up by employing Australian
scenery, the occupants of a school, station-
hands and a tribe of abos. But obvioush'
scenes were shot until perfect. The result
is a good picture, distinctly Australian, and
more interesting on that account to non-
Australian audiences.
INCOGNITO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, Aloysius Thundervoyse
Hugged the belief within him
That he in any line could play,
Though rivals were “agin” him
In this particular, because
His booming voice defied all lavs
Of modulation, and its bray
Gave Aloysius away,
Whatever make-up he’d essay.
Invariably for such parts
As villains with a lurid past,
In spite of protest dignified,
Our Aloysius was cast.
It drove him frantic, for he knew
That heroes gallant, fond, and true;
The suave and stately Good Old Man;
Or even Light Comedian
Fitted his histrionic span.
So one day, when the stately Star
Succumbed to Northern Queensland rum,
On Aloysius it was borne
That liis appointed hour had come.
To the stage manager “Come hee-arr,”
He cried, “meh bo-oy, and lend an e-arr;
Put bey dull ca-rre, let wor-ray go,
Ai’m hee-arr to save the ball-eli show,
Beh doubling up the two pa-rrts—So!
“In the fi-rrst scene, as Vill-ain, Ai,
In a black wig, the hero-whine
Shall perss-ecute despitefulhey ;
And, when Ai’ve finished in that line—
Wh-y, then Ai’ll go up stage, you see,
And make my exit, R.U.E.;
A fai-rr wig don, and damme when
As lie-ro I dash on again—
Why, who, de-arr boy, would know me!
then ?”

Spring brings with it Skin
Troubles, Pimples, Boils and
other Skin Eruptions.
Why Worry?
Rexona is the Rapid Healer which
brings Skin Health and Beauty.
We all look forward to the Spring and often forget how
the change of season affects our health and naturally our skin,
causing pimples, sores, rashes, blotches, eczema and even boils
and ulcers to break out.
These skin eruptions are dangerous if neglected, and might
become chronic—you must give them careful attention. There
is no better treatment than to apply Rexona, the Rapid
Healer. This is an antiseptic ointment containing just the right
cooling, soothing and healing properties that are needed to rid
your skin of all impurities and give you a fair start for the
Summer. Rexona soothes pain, builds new, fresh tissues and
renews and heals the skin. The triangular pot of Rexona, with
its healing, soft green ointment, should be kept handy on the
dressing-table so that every member of the family can have
access to its wonderful healing powers.

Poor Simple Annie.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LITTLE white seagull gave me its soul!
(Oh white rumpled feathers and wee,
rounded hr east!)
A little white seagull gave me its soul!
How shall I find any rest?
There’s none but my shadow and I on the
beach,
Till the brown laughing children come
racing to play,
And the fishermen pull in their boats for the
hauling.
There’s none that can hear me “Hoi! Hoi!”
when I’m calling
And catching the ribands and rainbows of
spray.
There's none but my shadow and I on the
beach,
To loiter, then run from the crawling tide’s
reach ;
No sound but the waters all rising and
falling,
And wind in the tussocks that tremble and
sway.
Upon the grey cliff-top the bright sunlight
falls ;
The little white cottages drunkenly lean,
With staring front-windows close-curtained
and shining,
And purple convolvulus twisting and twining
Around the low porches and fences of
green.
Upon the grey cliff-top the bright sunlight
falls, _ .
Imprinting its yellow on crumbling old
walls;
And blue-trousered’ fishers at doors are re-
clining,
With coarse, mended fishing-nets hung in
between;
they never now ask me to take up the
broom
Aiid sweep the blown pathways as clean
Mis a pin;
There’s, Mary and Mattie for washing and
drying,
Fdf laying the cloth when the long day is
dying—
They know I am driven, and cannot stay in.
They never now ask me to take up the broom
And sweep the fine sand that has silvered
each room,
lor my feet must be out where the wild scud
is flying
And petals of foam-flowers circle and spin.
lor a little white seagull once gave me its
soul,
Though how it was given I never can tell,
rsor which little seagull adrift in tin*
gloiiming
Lame calling me, calling me, back from its
roaming,
A-riding a crest of the incoming swell,
fettle white seagull once gave me its soul,
i ihrum, bitter sea-wind ! O green billows,
toll!)
I shall not know till one comes to me homing,
Asking its soul that I’ve guarded so well.
Once there came boldly a man of the sea,
A salt-bitten sailor with love in his eyes ;
Touched me with hands that were awkward
and burning,
And filled me with passion and tender,
strange yearning,
And mingled my longing with tremulous
sighs.
Once there came boldly a man of the sea,
Whispering his love-talk unbidden to me.
Hey! But my heart was not slow for the
learning
That sorrow is both for the foolish and
wise!
For how should he marry me, soul of a bird?
I with my fancies of white veering wings?
Aever again should I hear the sea-thunder,
'* atcliing the billows breaking asunder,
But I should leave him for dearer sea-
tliihgs.
How should lie marry me, soul of a bird,
Screeching and wailing of storms I had
heard!
(Blit oh, the dark hair of him! Oh, the
dark wonder !. ...
Mary and Mattie have fingers with rings!)
“Poor simple Annie” they call me and say,
Pointing their fingers, “Her wits are
grown dull!”
Watching me trudge when the slow tides are
creeping
Along past the grass-tufts where white sand
is heaping
Little blown drifts round a buried, black
hull.
“Poor simple Annie” they call me, and say,
“Where is your lost lover, Annie, to-day?”
Oh, how should they know that in waking
and sleeping
I am gone questing a little white gull!
Little white sister-bird, where are you gone?
What windless sea-hollow high up is your
goal?
Qurled coral feet and a flurry of feather.
Sweeping out, sweeping out, ’gainst the wild
weather,
Where the sails dip to the billows’ long
roll!
Little white sist?r-bird, where are you gone?
I would be seeking you, wandering on.
Little white sisters and brothers together!
I would be giving you back your wild soul!
A little white seagull gave me its soul!
(Oh white rumpled feathers and wee
rounded breast!)
A little white seagull gave me its soul!
How shall I find any rest?

MYRA MORRIS
“The Dommed Sailor-man.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
RICHARD McGEE came of a stock
whose menfolk had grubbed in the
ground through two hundred years.
Maybe even longer—for there is Cornish
blood in them. The McGees had become part
of the pit and the pit a part of the McGees.
Of the three brothers, Alister was a level
foreman. Charles labored with the blind pit-
ponies, and Mark, Richard’s father, the least
enterprising and the best miner of them all,
had toiled at the tunnel-head with the shifts
for twenty years and more. Had, I say, until
a rotted timber collapsed and walled liim and
twelve workmates up, sliut off from the light
of the sun by tumbled rock. They perished
from falling rocks... .hunger. . . .despair. .. .
or the darkness. . . .or all four. None know
for certain. A month later young Richard
was born, his mother half-daft with the
horror of it all. But the child was healthy
enough, sound in wind and limb, and walked
and spoke in due and proper time. Alister
gave thanks that here was another good
pitman come to earth —dour thanks to his
rather dour God.
Early in the ’nineties the mine closed
down, and Alister, driven from pillar to post
with the burden of a mentally-incapacitated
sister-in-law and the boy, emigrated as a
farm-laborer. Perhaps, at one time, he had
hopes of a home and the quiet enjoyment of
old age in the fertile valley of the Murrum-
bidgee. Vain hopes, of course. All that he
encountered was not included in the Com-
monwealth Immigration circulars. Alister
could no more farm than his neighbors
could understand the intricacies of coal-
getting three or four hundred feet down. In
a brief year he, the woman and the boy
had drifted up to the mines of their new
world, and there lie found work on a holding
that gave up its black wealth grudgingly.
In the little town that had sprung up
about the pit-mouths Richard grew to boy-
hood, ever fearing with the strength of a
hereditary emotion the clammy depths of the
pits—their sight and sound and smell;
worst of all, their darkness.
When the boy was twelve, Alister, grown
sour —not a little brutal indeed in these lean
years—found him a job on the skips and set
him to it, for all his tearful protests. For
two days the boy stood it, laboring in fear
of his miserable little life. And on the
second night he “jumped” an inwards goods-
train, and on the third was tucked snugly
away in the hold of a South American
freighter bound for Chile ports.
And that is all we know of young Richard
for ten years.
He was 25 when lie came back bearing all
the outward signs of a startling prosperity,
including a blue uniform with brass buttons
and a peaked cap, a mountain of baggage
and an avalanche of packing-cases. He had
become a mariner; Well, if not exactly a
mariner, at least he had been assistant-
purser and the like on overseas ships these
three years. Beyond that his past was draped
in mystery. Superior, debonair, eternally
complacent, his was the air of a man of
tile world who had experienced milch and
seen more.
He found the town iittie changed, even if
the mines were drawing to their end. It was
pleasantly startled at the apparition of
Richard. Richard thoroughly enjoyed him-
self. He bore gifts—a great box of choco-
lates for his mother, whose sweet tooth he
remembered ; a plaque or two for the mantel,
and some pictures, decent enough in their
way. For Alister he brought a cumbersome
meerschaum and some tobacco from Havana.
Old Mary went nearly sane with delight,
though Alister, if he felt a sneaking pride,
was still pit-proud and snatched his tobacco
gracelessly muttering, “Dommed sailor-man!”
Richard only went back to his mother and
laughed boyishly.
From the instant of his arrival Richard
was a success. The parson and the store-
keepers and the managers, who had most of
them seen better days, took him to their
bosom. As *all good sailor-men should, he
spun entertaining yarns and produced from
his packing-cases innumerable proofs of
innumerable adventures. He talked of pearl-
ing at Broome, and a venture of much peril
in the sandalwood trade —somewhere in the
Indian Ocean.
His old friends among the pit-boys looked
upon him with unfriendly curiosity, and were
as brief as might be in their intercourse
with him. Richard was a cut above them
and they resented it. Was he not the son of
a pit-man whose great-great-grandfather had
labored in the cuts as well? Alister spoke
openly of his old fear with resentful relish,
and the pit, in a sense, came to hold him in
contempt. “A dommed sailor-man !” Nothing
more, nothing less —and “scairt o’ the dark.”
Three weeks before his leave expired
Richard found that he had fallen in love.
It was not the daughter of the manager, nor
yet of the parson, nor of the storekeeper;
it was Jean, whose parents were plain people,
and with whom Richard had no intercourse,
for they had all the miner’s prejudices.
Richard knew- that he was in love; he’d
been in love in a sort of a way a dozen
times before, but this was the real thing.
Jeanie was dark and brilliant and small,
with becoming refinement of features for all
her plumpness : and quiet as all good sailors’
wives should be.
The third time Richard met her he kissed
her —and was immensely astonished when she
smacked his face for his pains. The fourth
time he proposed—and was laughed at.
That very night, going home from the
dance, he believed that he had found the
root cause of it all. Passing the garden
gate he saw a grimy miner kiss her —full on
the upturned mouth! A grimy miner!
Richard was speechless. Hate flamed up in
him. Fists clenched, he waited for the man
to pass him.
“Hey, you!” he snapped venomously, all
the bitterness of a wounded vanity exploding
in the phrase.
The fellow r whirled about, the little lamp
at his cap-peak lighting his features.
“What the —what do you mean by kissing
that girl, you—lubber?”
The fellow burst out laughing. “I got a
right, never you worry, little boy,” was his
answer, and he made as if to move on.
Richard clutched his shoulder and swung
back his fist. But pit-hardened hands grasped
his arms in a grip of iron, and pit-hardened
muscles precipitated him ten feet away in
an oily pool. His head cracked against a
stone, and he lay mud-bespattered, boiling.
The miner passed on whistling. Next night
after a three-hour wait, he had a chance to
tell Jeanie his tale of woe. She. too, laughed,
only to calm down a moment later and tell
him what she thought of him. “Scairt o’
the pit” and “dommed sailor-roan” was the
substance of it.
He slept ill through the fore part of that
night, dreaming of the pit and of Jeanie and
of awful, pressing, smothering darkness. It
was nearly three o’clock when, protesting
sleepily, he was wakened by Alister.

“Hold yer whist, ye sailor fule!" he said,
“an’ get yer togs on! There’s man’s work
to do this night.”
Richard started up. “What’s wrong?”
“Enough. Temple and his shift blasted
through into water, and tliey’s drooned.
Wairse, tliey’s twelve lads trapped in number
three east. Curley hears ’em knockin’ as he
comes up.”
“God!” breathed Richard, realisation
dawning on him.
“Tha’ll poomp to-night as tha’ never
poomped afore.” The old man shook his fist
threateningly.
There was a mad flurry at the pit-head.
Naked flares were doing their best to turn
the darkness into red day.
Davison was rigging hand-pumps, labor-
ing, sweating, stripped to the waist. Davison,
whom lie had always regarded as something
of a dandy-do-nothing, lording it over the
workers in puffy riding-breeches and a black
silk shirt!
The furnace-house was a little hell, the
crazy pumping machinery shrieking and
clattering its travail to the night. Even
with a smutty stream pouring ceaselessly
from the pipes, they barely held the flood in
check. By mid-day they might win. A
forlorn hope at best.
Richard gazed down from the dizzy brink
of number one shaft into a babel of activity.
They were rigging the last hand-pump.
Shouts came up.
“In with ye!” said Alister grimly, and
Richard went down with the first cageful
to stand a stage of back-breaking labor.
From his bar he could see the main cut
sloping steeply down, and the taut steel
cable still holding full skips to the narrow
steel rails. He could hear the sucking of
water against timber deep down, and, against
his will, a phrase came into his head, keeping
time to the. clank of the pumps and the
beating of his own ear-drums. It was “The
lips of death !” “The lips of death !”
The work was telling. A man behind him
sobbed out: “Dead dry until to-night, dead
dry; not a thousand gallons a day through
the whole workings. God, what luck!”
Richard sniffed the clammy air about him.
There was the acrid fume of high explosive,
a trace of gas, all mingled with the never-
to-be-forgotten odor of underground! He
stared at the cut again; and a nameless
terror gripped him. But somewhere back in
the ages a voice called—-the voice of a
father he had never seen.
“Death !” it said.
A howling broke out from above. They
paused to look at one another blankly.
Davison broke out of the cage. “It can't
he helped, men,” he said, grey-faced; “but
the cylinder-heads have gone.”
When Richard came into the open air
clouds of steam were pouring from the,
pump-house. The engineer, arms scalded
raw. submitted listlessly to the ministrations
of the doctor. He had two brothers below.
Somewhere at the back of the- crowd a
woman was sobbing her heart out in dry,
choking sobs.
Old Alister broke into clamor. “Daft
loonies that we are!” he howled at Davison.
“There’s the old northern workings, dry and
a hundred feet deeper than the cut, scarce
six feet from seven west! If we could blast
through and drain her!”
Davison raised a haggard face from his
hands. “No use, Alister; I’d thought of
that. The old Northern’s been closed these
dozen years. No man could work in her
for ten minutes. Monoxide. Besides, she
never was much better than a well-shaft.”
“But”
“Two hours’ll be too late for those lads
at the head of number three. Over the ridge
there’s not thirty feet of air. God help us all!”
Richard spoke with a note of wild eager-
ness in his voice. “How far is six west under
water —straight down, I mean ; not the dis-
tance?”
“Eighty feet,” said Davison, after a
moment's calculation. “In an hour it will be
ninety. What”
But Richard was gone, racing through the
crowd, murmuring inwardly to the tune of
his fleeting footsteps—“ Fifteen fathoms !”
Alister watched him go with a withering
sneer of contempt.
It was an hour before he was back. The
water had risen eight feet.
“Davison,” lie called, pausing to let the
weary manager overtake him. “What would
it take to blow through the wall between
the Northern and six west?”
“Nothing short of ten pounds, properly
laid, to make sure.” What scheme had this
young idiot devised now?
“Can you fire off dynamite under the
water?”
"Yes—with an insulated flex.”
“What’s the distance from there to the top
of number six?”
"A good quarter-mile, not counting the
three hundred feet down the main cut. What’s
the idea?”
Richard ignored him. “Have you enough
wire?”
“Two six-hundred-foot, lengths. I can join
them. What”
“Are they heavy?”
“About twenty pounds.”
“And just where arc these men?”
“Look here,” Davison broke out, “what’s
your idea? For God’s sake, talk, man. This
is no time to play about.”,
“See here,” said Richard, and unrolled his
bulky bundle.
“What’s that?” Davison stared with half-
comprehending eyes.
“That,” said Richard, slipping off his
boots, “is a diving-suit.”
Davison gasped unbelievingly.
“Get the dynamite—‘jelly,’ or whatever
you call it, and the rolls of wire. Fix it. all
ready to go off. And look nippy.”
The man hesitated a bare second. “You
can’t do it,” he said half-heartedly.
The sailor-man was tugging at his suit.
The bobbing shift watched him with curious
eyes. He twirled the screws of his copper
headpiece with trembling fingers and
fixed his boots. Davison came back with
the wire and something wrapped up in
a sack. “I’ve plugged her in four places,”
he said, breathlessly. “For God’s sake, go
easv with it.”
Richard was past caring. “You can’t
recharge dry cells, can you?” he asked. “I
hope m.v light’ll list." His face was very
white. “.Tust wheVe are those men, and how
many tunnels are there to right and left?”
“Four east and seven west. That’s left
and right respectively. We face due south.
Six west is three hundred feet from where
we stand, and roughly ninety under water.
That makes a gallery every twenty yards
or so. Number six is the only one of any
length. It cuts out a sharp angle from the
general run of the others. You can't miss
it, for the cut turns after that, straightens out
and follows the line of the seam. Turn up
three east —tell them if you can. You know
what it will mean. You should know where
to put the charge—with ten generations of
mining men behind you. That’s all I can
tell you. Good luck.”
“Luck, lad.” said old Alister.
Richard heard the ragged roar they raised
about him. He vented a sickly smile.
“Three-quarters of an hour —then fire
her,” were his last words as he clamped down
the headpiece.
Ile tottered forward on his lead soles and
plunged into sooty blackness. Farther and
farther from light and the open with each
successive step. Terror, redoubled, held him
iu its icy grip. Down into the earth —down
and down and down! A sweat of nameless
terror bathed his body, lie remembered his
hand-lamp—feeble glimmer of light that
struggled weakly against the gloom. He
bumped an overturned skip—lightly, for
water deadens blows —and struggled for a
desperate minute, caught between two fallen
timbers. The light helped him there. Some-
how it was a check to the hereditary terror
that waged battle with the hereditary pride
within him.
Inky galleries stretched away east and
west. “Three east,” he muttered —“they’re
somewhere up there.”
Something bumped his helmet —and for a
moment he looked up into a swollen human
face. Shuddering, he pushed past the limp,
suspended corpse. Trapped by a tottering
beam! Fear had him again. He almost
turned back.
Further on the lamp showed the glimmer
of surface water. He thrust his head out
and looked around. There was a still body
at the margin of the water —nothing more.
He wrestled with his visor and a babel of
reedy shouts came to him, echoing hollowly.
“Hallo!” he yelled back. “Stay up there.
Are you all right?”
A high laugh answered him, “Right as
rain, mate. When do you get us out of this
-—— hole?”
“How many are there?”
“Eleven.”
“There’s a man down here.”
“He's dead.”
As if to give the lie to the speaker, a leg
twitched feebly. With fumbling fingers he
rolled the man over and turned the light
on his face.
“Eh, mate, is the water risin’?” he heard'.
Richard did not. answer. The face he peered
into was that of the miner who had pitched
him into the gutter two nights before!
“He’s gone,” said a voice higher up.
Richard clamped his visor and moved back
into the darkness, like a giant sea-slug.
The copper helmet came out of the water
again. And again voices called: “Is the
water risin’, mate?”
“A little,” said Richard. “But we'll have
you out in two shakes now. I'm putting a
shot through to the Northern to drain her.
One of you come down and get this poor
chap. Hearts up!”
He groped his way downward, pit fever
in his veins. This tunnel and this dark
might have been his prison-house through a
hundred years. Somehow he knew where
next to put his foot. Richard McGee was
riding the sailor-man!
He clambered noiselessly in a noiseless
world to greater depths. His eyeballs beat
with the pressure. The light flickered lower.
Still, without haste, he pulled the flex behind
him. He floated his bundle down and
weighed it with a piece of coal whilst he
scraped a hollow under the bulging lee of the
tunnel head.
The light and his work were almost done.
He placed the charge in the hole and heaped
rocks on it, working all the time unflurried,
and turned back just after the lamplight had
given away to a blanket of darkness.
No longer unafraid, Richard cried his
terror in his own deafened ears. All he
knew was that he was deep down, separated
from the air by a wall of stifling gloom.
No air—no light—little hope! Only the des-
perate will to die in the light—the blessed
light!
Groping along the flex he scraped his suit
in a dozen places.
There was no one on earth but himself
now—no poor, reedy.-voiced wretches doomed
to slow death —no Jeanie—nothing but the
will to look once more on the sun. Uncon-
sciousness was close upon him. lie could
feel it—a tangible thing 1
He risked all in one desperate dash for
the surface. Turning the Valve full on, his
suit puffed out; lie shot, like some grotesque
monster, straight for. the dim light that
Davison held to the surface of the slowly-
rising pool.
The manager grasped his copper helmet
and jerked him bodily out. Then in cool
haste he turned to the plunger. There was
a little shudder—the water leapt an inch
or two. That was all. Then it began to
sink—one inch—two —three ! Davison sat
heedlessly on Richard's chest and began to
cry. Alister pulled him off, cursing, and
fumbled with the clamps. Richard had gone
into even greater blackness.
They brought him up to the open air and
lay him face up to the smiling sky as he
would have wished.
An hour later eleven white-faced men,
surrounded by a mob of yelling, joy-mad
mates, struggled up from the cut soaked
to the waist. And behind them they carried
a twelfth.
Jeanie dropped on the turf beside him.
“Kit. brother dear,” she whispered tear-
fully. “Come back to us. Come back to
mother and the dommed sailor-man and me!"
Alister stared down at his nephew's
twitching face. “Tha’d ha’ made a pitman,
lad,” he said wistfully.
•{• *!*
Four others in brass buttons and all
attended the wedding. And amid the cheers
nobody recalled that they were dommed
sailor-men.
