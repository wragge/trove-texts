FAIR PLAY
THE NAKED viciousness of the South
African Government’s attitude to the
inclusion of Basil D’Oliveira in the
MCC cricket team to tour that country
might have the useful result that it will
put an end to the perpetual inanity
that “politics shouldn’t come into
sport.” The case is the same whether
it is Rhodesian golfers coming to
Australia or South African cricketers
going back to what was their home.
Those who produce the keep-politics-
out-of-sport argument seem to feel not
that, as is often claimed, sport turns
boys into men, but that it enables men
to remain children.
UN-AUSTRALIAN
ALTHOUGH there has been some anti-
Americanism in this country there has
not been a great deal of the virulent
form widespread in other countries, but
one can see. how it could grow.
Last week, for example, there was
the naming of the- U.S. Naval Com-
munications Station Harold E. Holt at
North West Cape. Harold E. Holt,
actually, is Australia’s former Prime
Minister, Harold Holt, and North West
Cape once was part of Australia.
Then there was the statement by a
spokesman for Gillette, in answer to
criticism of the attitudes of foreign
investors by the Minister for National
Development, Mr. Fairbairn. “Instead
of shipping razor blades into Australia,”
said the spokesman, “we are making
them here, providing jobs for Austra-
lians up to management level.” Up to
management level. We like that bit.
CRIME WAVE BY THE SEA
NOW that the N.S.W. Leader of the
Opposition, Mr. Pat Hills, seems for
the moment to have . exhausted the
political possibilities of Sydney’s crime
wave, he might turn his attention to
the one they are apparently having at
Batemans Bay.
Batemans Bay is a small holiday
town on the South Coast, frequented
by Canberra people. The “Canberra
Times” recently reported a wave of
robberies at holiday houses there; one
householder had in desperation boarded
up his house. The ended:
“Police at Batemans Bay said last night
they had this year received a number
of complaints about thefts from homes,
but there was little they could do to
prevent them.”
This admission may be the only
burst of rare honesty by the local
police, but it is startling just the same.
If the police can “do little” about
guarding people’s properties what must
we do? Board up our houses? Arm
ourselves?
Actor Rod Taylor...at leisure
RAISING THEIR VOICES
ART AS A FORM of protest isn’t new,
but it is current.
An impressive collection of painters,
composers, musicians, poets, and actors
are taking part in “Arts Vietnam,”
which is to be held in Sydney next
month, and Sydney University students,
inspired by an American idea, “guer-
rilla theatre,” are staging their version
of the theatrical demonstration — “not
so hard on the public as the ordinary
kind of demonstration,” they say.
The idea of “Arts Vietnam” origin-
ated when actor Peter O’Shaughnessy
and Guy Morrison, a Sydney journalist,
found they were harboring similar
schemes about an arts festival as a
means of protesting against the war in
Vietnam. The cast of participants now
includes about 40 painters, John Olsen
and Arthur and David Boyd among
them, composers Peter Sculthorpe,
Richard Meale, Nigel Butterly, poet R.
D. Fitzgerald, some jazz musicians, folk
singers, and several “pop” groups
“The Id,” “The Nutwood Rug Band,”
and others.
The festival, most of which will be
held at the Teachers’ Federation Hall,
will stretch over a week, early in Octo-
ber, ,and, the organisers say, is designed
to “show that a large group of people
involved in the arts are ready to talk
in opposition to the war. For the most
part, the concerts and exhibitions won’t
have overt references to Vietnam but
many of the artists will make brief
statements about it.”
If there is any profit from the fes-
tival, this will help pay the fares of
people coming from other countries to
speak at a conference titled “The Asian
Revolution and Australia,” which fol-
lows the festival. Organised by the
Association for International Co-opera-
tion and Disarmament, this will be held
from October 11 in Sydney’s Lower
Town Hall.
The students’ plan may not have
this kind of polish, but its organisers
have hopes for its future as a more
publicly acceptable alternative to the
usual type of demonstration.
The American example of “guerilla
theatre,” which has prompted the Aus-
tralian idea, was shown on television a
few weeks ago on the ABC in a “Four
Corners” segment on the U.S. presi-
dential elections.
In it a small group of demonstrators,
without props or costumes, enacted a
political situation before a street-corner
audience. It was tightly controlled,
quite dramatic, and successful in involv-
ing its audience.
The Sydney students have set up a
similar group to perform “guerilla
theatre” demonstrations in the streets,
at shopping centres like Australia
Square, railway stations “anywhere
where people gather.”

SLOW RIDE
WHEN actor Rod Taylor was here
recently for the premiere of his film
“The High Commissioner,” he talked
about the local film he hopes to make
soon. And, indeed, who does not?
Taylor hopes to make “Last Bus to
Banjo Creek.” This is a script of Ted
Willis’, based on a short story by
Western Australian writer H. H. Wilson,
called “The Schedule.”
“Last Bus to Banjo Creek” was first
talked about in 1962, which was a vin-
tage year for unmade films; at that time
Jack Lee was going to film Criena
Rohan’s “The Delinquents,” Diane
Cilento was to appear in D’Arcy
Niland’s “Call Me When the Cross
Turns Over,” and Sumner Locke
Elliott’s “Careful, He Might Hear
You” and Kenneth Cook’s “Wake in
Fright” were forthcoming. In Aus-
tralia it’s a long while between buses
to Banjo Creek.

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
Sam figure, a brutal Digger and perse-
cuted Asian girl, did not have quite the
subtlely of its American counterparts,
and the students ran into a little police
opposition at Australia Square, but they
are enthusiastic.
“The thing is that people who
wouldn’t be willing to join in demon-
strations will be in something like this,”
Ray Markey, the chief organiser told
us. “At the moment, there are 24 of
us. I suppose half of them have been
activists during the year, but we’ve got
quite a few new people as well.”
Most are members of the Students
for Democratic Society, which boasts
eight sub-committees “dealing with
racial matters, Vietnam, Biafra, and so
on.”
HALL'S HALL
THE SITE of the proposed Festival
Hall remains a contentious topic in
Adelaide. The Government’s latest
proposal is an area in Elder Park on the
banks of the Torrens Lake, where, at the
moment, stand a migrant hostel, a sound
shell, the City Baths, and railway
offices. The site has some merit, being
close to transport, the city, and parking
facilities, but, unfortunately, in addition
to a trunk sewer which will cost
$50,000 to re-route, the site is precisely
where the proposed Adelaide under-
ground railway is to emerge at its
northern end. The Premier, Mr. Hall,
feels that this is not an insuperable
problem, for the line could be re-
routed north following the demolition
of the old, attractive brownstone
Government Printing Office.
The City Council, which rejected the
Montefiore Hill site previously suggested
by the Government, has given tentative
support to the new plan, but in Parlia-
ment the Opposition continues to press
for the site, recommended in what is
known as the DeGaetani Report, which
is unoccupied land at the back of Gov-
ernment House, several hundred yards
from the Elder Park site.
Until recently, when a precis became
available, the DeGaetani Report , was
virtually unknown to those it most con-
cerned, people actively involved in the
performing arts. It is fully styled “A
Feasibility Study for the Adelaide
Festival Hall,” and was commissioned
this year by the Dunstan Government
from the Theatre Consulting Services
of Bolt Beranek and Newman of New
York, whose manager, Thomas DeGae-
tani, came to Adelaide to study the
situation and interview interested
parties.
The report emerges as an impressive
argument and plan for co-ordinated
public and governmental support of the
performing arts. Readers wading
through its jargon learn that with
“responsible architectural, technical,
and quantity surveillance in-put” a
Performing Arts Centre can be “realised
within a fiscal context of $4.8 million
dollars,” and then go on to read of
“optimal dramatic, lyric-theatrical,
musical, and filmic experience” and “a
full spectrum of resident professional
performance organisation.” Even if the
report is not acted upon, it can at least
be set for correction in High Schools.
Dealing with the site of the Perform-
ing Arts Centre, the report recom-
mends the Government House land for
a variety of cogent reasons. The Centre
itself, it suggests, should contain a
multi-purpose theatre-concert hall seat-
ing up to 2000, what is described as
“an objective, uncommitted experimen-
tal hall,” and an arena theatre, seating
up to 800 people, and designed to be
the home of a professional theatre
company.
It goes on to detail acoustic and
mechanical aspects of the centre, and
the end result is, on paper, a modest
but efficient and eminently functional
building concept which, if built, would
be of inestimable value to any city
in the Commonwealth. Unfortunately,
while it has not clearly committed
itself on the matter, the .Hall Govern-
ment seems to rather favor the more
grandiose concept of a single, expen-
sive Festival Hall, a public building
with a cultural excuse.
Equally important, however, is the
report’s recommendations on what is
styled the “South Australian Council
on the Arts.” This body, it recommends,
should be made up of local cultural,
educational, business, and governmental
leaders, appointed by the Premier, with
the Council accountable to its Chair-
man and the Chairman accountable to
the Premier. The Council would
appoint a full-time Director-General to
carry out its basic aims, and he in
turn would chair the Council’s Execu-
tive Committee, made up of sectional
Chairmen of further committees
variously involved with Performing
Arts’ Education, Theatre, Music, the
Centre itself, the Festival, and Radio,
Television, and Cinema. Appointed by
the Council, the six sectional Chairmen
would be accountable to the Director-
General. Only the Arts Centre Chair-
man would be a full-time appointment.
The report further suggests that the
Festival should be under the control
of one person, perhaps the Director-
General “if he were a man possessing
a rare combination of administrative
talents and sympathies,” and this is the
crucial point in the whole plan. The
plan will stand or fall on the character,
talents, and artistic intelligence of the
Director - General. With legislative
backing, strong State and Common-
wealth financial support (Dr. Coombs’
Council supplying the latter), and an
absence of infighting among estab-
lished groups, it could provide the kind
of intensive support the performing arts
need in a medium-size metropolitan
context. But the greatest danger lies
in its bureaucratic complexity. With
the wrong men or women at various
key points, thd structure could simply
supply a refuge for mediocre talents
and pedestrian ideas.

2000 AUTO
IF ONE CAN BELIEVE
THE MOTORING EXPERTS
(AND WE DO) EACH OF
OUR THREE DIFFERENT
ROVER 2000'S IS THE
FINEST CAR IN
THE WORLD.
DOES THAT MAKE YOUR
CHOICE HARDER OR
EASIER?
You now have a choice of three Rover
2000’s: single carburettor (S.C.), twin car-
burettor (T.C.) and Automatic. Of our S.C.
model, "Wheels" says: “A magnificent
motor car that stands as the world's finest
argument against the people who would
eliminate fast cars." Of our T.C. model,
"Car and Driver" says: "We believe that
the Rover 2000 TC is absolutely the best
sedan that has ever been presented in the
pages of this magazine.” Of our Automatic
model, "Road Test” says: “Our previous
consensus that the Rover 2000 is amongst
the finest cars in the world is enhanced by
the addition of the Automatic.” At first sight
this plethora of praise may tend to make
your choice more difficult. But in fact it’s
fairly straight sailing if you think of it like
this: The S.C. model costs the least and has
enough power (0-100 in 45 secs.) to keep
all but the most ardent enthusiasts purring.
It has so many safety features (about fifty)
that it consistently takes out the top safety
awards around the world. It has bucket
seats (both front and rear) which have been
called the most comfortable in the world,
with particular regard for the small of the
back. Other creature comforts include
genuine leather upholstery, wall-to-wall
carpeting and a virtuoso heating and ven-
tilating system. Plus, of course, typically
Rover-ish touches like an electric clock
and a steering wheel that adjusts up and
down to suit you. The road-holding and
braking of the 2000 SC are legendary, so
much so that the motoring writers of the
world are still inventing superlatives to
describe them. The T.C. model has all the
above plus an 18% lift in horsepower that
makes it a very hot motor car indeed. (It
also has a tachometer of the hero-driver
genre for the benefit of enthusiasts like
Jack Fury.) The Automatic, likewise, has all
the features of the S.C. model with the
added advantage of clutchless driving. (In
fact, you can drive this one either auto-
matically or manually.) Well, there it is. Now
all you need is an hour or so to test drive
the one that is you.

THE MONKEES
GETTING ALL
SOCIALLY SIGNIFICANT
YOUR long-in-the-tooth correspondent
has a good memory for airport arrivals.
There were the tearful arrivals of
Johnnie Ray, those marvellous days
when Mr. Ray’s suits were half-
unstitched, so that they could be torn
apart with convenience by the fans.
His arrivals were worth nine out of
ten. There were the petulant arrivals
of Frank Sinatra, three out of ten.
Then there was the arrival of the
Beatles. They were much smarter than
anybody else. They arrived on a
Queen’s Birthday weekend on a Sunday.
Well, you know Melbourne on a Sun-
day—play “Ride of Valkyries” on a
gumleaf and you’d get a crowd of
15,000. Well, on that day the esti-
mated crowd was 300,000 with 15,000
trying to storm the Southern Cross
Hotel. Three hundred and fifty were
treated for fainting, hysteria, and minor
injuries. Oh, yes, the Beatles’ arrival
deserved ten out of ten.
After mature consideration I give the
arrival of the Monkees five out of
ten. They arrived at noon on a
Monday. There were fewer than 2000
waiting to see them. They were mostly
girls, but they were real quality, because
three out of four were in school
uniform, and they were defying the
awful inevitable discipline of the State
education system. At the airport ter-
minal three very junior girls in school
uniform and a boy were smoking
cigarettes. Monkees fans need some-
thing to steady the nerves.
A “TV Week” reporter said they had
19,000 fans in their Monkees fan club.
They took a survey of the first 13,000
and found that the average of the girls
was 12 and the boys 13.
At Essendon there were 40 police,
peace officers, and security men. There
were men equipped with walkie-talkies,
and one gained the impression that
Essendon was ready for a mortar
attack by the Viet Cong. But the sub-
teen crowd wasn’t awfully dangerous.
It screamed best when cameras were
in their direction. Yet the police took
no chances. As soon as the Monkees
stepped out of the aeroplane, they were
put straight into a closed car. Just
one girl in a grey school tunic made a
desperate effort. She jumped the fence
and leapt head-first into the car
window. The police grabbed her and
pulled her back. Then she did it again,
but this time the police lifted her up
and deposited her over the fence.
The Monkees then went to the
President Motor Inn, in Queens Road,
opposite Albert Park Lake. Here, for
days, there was a state of siege. Some


fans waited outside all night. However,
it was like getting into the White
House. One was only admitted to the
motel if wearing a special badge, and
only the very great were allowed into
the presence of the Monkees.
There was just one breach of security.
Some Monkees lovers picked a back-
door lock with a hairpin. This was
said to be a burglar-proof lock which
required a 360 deg. turn to open. The
manager then found ten girls, two of
them in school uniform, in the women’s
lavatory, two boys in the men’s, and
two girls in a garbage tin.
The switch girls nearly went crazy.
At peak hours they averaged five calls
a minute. One said: “They tried any-
thing on. Their favorite trick was to
pretend it was a long-distance call from
the U.S., and they would use several
voices. ‘Trunks. New York trunks. New
York calling Mr. Dolenz, yes, New
York. Connecting . . .’ I was always a
wake-up, though. Except once, they used
a genuine American voice. I was
tricked, and put them through.”
The Press conference was on the
Tuesday morning, and, to the detriment
of so many Press conferences these
times, on live TV. Micky was in bril-
liant yellow, Mike wore a leather jacket
in the style of Big Chief Sitting Bull.
He said it was genuine Sioux, unlike the
genuine one he wore the day before,
which was made by a Chinese Sioux in
Hong Kong. Davy had on a pink blouse.
The most attractive was Peter Tork.
He wore a shirt which was a psyche-
delia of orange and yellow leaves with
orange trousers to match. He also
had beads and a medal on a chain. A
scruffy reporter in sportscoat and no
“Ugh! To think we’re all descended
from monkeys!”
tie, asked him if he considered his
clothes were “way out.” He said: “No,
but I think yours are.”
There were gentle questions about
their personal habits, their pets, about
extreme examples of Monkees devotion.
Mike said one time a fan sent him a
chain five miles long made entirely out
of chewing-gum wrappers. What was
the significance? “I don’t know,” he
said. “But he now probably has bad
teeth. You know the advertising slogan
for gum, ‘Hi ho hay chew your
troubles away.’ ”
Peter Tork asked: “How about some
socially significant questions?”
So we got significant.
Mike on the color problem: “The
Negro has been grossly misrepresented,
and the situation in the South is very
bad. I am an integrationist, and I think
anyone who believes in segregation is
sick.”
Mike on Vietnam: “I think the whole
thing has been a terrible mistake. I
believe we should get out now. I think
we have a sick society.”
Mike on the police: “The brutality
of the police is a problem. Some people
come to me and say, ‘What can you do
to escape this?’ I answer, ‘Be a cop.’ ”
Micky had a beautiful disarming
honesty. He said the draft was after
him right this minute. No he wasn’t a
conscientious objector. “I’m scared to
death. I just don’t want to go. I’ll
go away. Go anywhere.” So now his
lawyers are busy building up a case.
Micky announced that he was for
anarchy: “I don’t think there should
be a. President at all. I don’t think
there should be a Government. We
should be like we are now. You can
live without these things.”
Little Davy looked nonplussed. “I
think you need somebody to push the
buttons,” he said.
Mike became serious again: “The
problem with America is that the
workers have become the Establish-
ment. Now the students and the artists
and the intellectuals are looking for
revolt, but they are powerless.” And he
added bitterly, “The workers pay the
policemen to keep the weird-ohs in
line.”
And he told how they began. How
they answered an advertisement for
four “insane” boys to appear in TV and
how they were chosen out of 437
groups. “We spent eight months in the
great advertising incubator after we
were formed. They used to lock us in
a room behind dummy microphones
and teach us how to make spontaneous
funny answers to questions. They said,
‘You’re going to make $42 billion in a
minute.’ We stood that for only a
while. They made one big mistake. It
just happened that we had talent. And
some people lost their jobs over that.”
Someone asked if they were sincere.
Mike asked “What do you want
an obvious answer?” Micky interrupted:
“Look, sure we’re sincere. We like our
work. Relating to ten-year-old girls is
not easy. It takes a lot of under-
standing, and you can’t give them
things over their heads. I tell you, they
won’t buy anything.”
Mike said: “We’re being very honest
with you people and I hope you under-
stand that. This is not the normal
Press conference you get with a pop
group.”
It wasn’t, actually.
OUT AND ABOUT
Daphne Guinness
LOCKED UP
IN A MAKE-BELIEVE
WORLD
ON THE one hand it is a relief to get
the children back to school, you know,
four weeks can seem like a year in
certain circumstances. Especially when
the daily help and/or nurse throws a
temperament and walks out. With half
the contents of the silver cupboard
packed in that handy holdall of hers.
On the other hand, getting the angels
back renews all those agonies like the
daily run and the roster, the system
that starts off so well and ends kinda
sour, and everything else, including the
social life and all those school plays
where some creative teacher thinks it a
frightfully good idea for everyone this
term to dress up as a loaf or a bottle
of milk or a tree . . .
“. . . and one mother came in and
said she wanted her little girl dressed
as The Wind and I told her I couldn’t
possibly do that; all I could suggest
was she combed her hair spiky and
lacquered it and put wire in her skirts
to puff them out,” says Sheila Jennings,
who runs and owns a children’s fancy-
dress business down at the Cross. Oppo-
site the rear end of Kings Cross fire
station, to be accurate, which informa-
tion is included on her letterhead and
in the Pink Pages, because people will
get lost. It also waters down the im-
pression that the Cross is a bit of a
sinister place from which to be hiring
out kiddies’ dress-ups. Especially when
Mrs. Jennings falls asleep answering
the telephone, the business is exhausting,
she says, and all the mother hears the
other end is heavy breathing. Some-
times Mrs. Jennings has to pretend to
be another person when she wakens, it
embarrasses her so.
It is mid-morning, and down in the
basement of 207 Darlinghurst Road,
which also houses a hotchpotch of
professional talent, viz: a dentist, a
sculptor, a hairdresser, down in the
basement are steps lined with potted
plants and creepers, and a notice says
Jenns Theatrical Costumes. The front
door is locked and a printed card
commands callers to PLEASE KNOCK.
Mrs. Jennings opens the door barely
enough to expose her face. Has she,
she inquires, has she seen us before?
Oh, yes. Now she remembers. The
thing is she has locked the door be-


cause some strange Italian man’s been
here three times, she caught him
standing there staring at the stock and
she said bring your child down for a
fitting but he didn’t return. To make
quite sure he doesn’t get in today she
must lock up. Pardon her while she
does it now. And she turns the key.
This, then, is the beginning of the
rush for children’s fancy-dress, and
Mrs. Jennings, sweatered and skirted
and smoking heavily, is at this moment
being driven mad finding something
authentic turn-of-the-18th-century for
Judy and Virginia, who are taking part
in the Tamworth to Barraba vintage
train ride. Belinda, Caroline, Jennifer,
and Kylie are organised and their
costumes hang pristine from the
cleaners—the bill is hundreds a year—
in the backroom of what was once a
wholesale crockery place. The front
room is crammed with rows of hang-
ing costumes, hand-made by Mrs.
Jennings, from gorillas for boys to
Charleston shimmies for girls, $5.50 a
hire and $4 deposit returnable. On
the wall by the door hangs a portrait
of Queen Elizabeth the First, which
she bought with a job lot of stock
from The Old Buttonhole, when it was
The Old Buttonhole that is. Those
were the days. Mrs. Jennings props
herself against the dark green floral
wallpaper which was stuck up years
ago by two fancy-dress costumier
friends of hers, now doing terribly
well in London dressing Gielgud,
Fonteyn, Nureyev. They didn’t quite
finish the decor. She had plans for
concealed lighting and a double door
for the fitting-room, but somehow in
this business, and she’s been in it ten
years, she’s been going for her life
making and maintaining stock. The
phone rings and Mrs. Jennings says
pardon me and, into the phone, I’ll
ring you back, I’ve got someone here.
It rings again five minutes after and
she says the same.
Once, about four years ago, the ABC
did a piece on her. They arrived with-
out telling and put this mike thing in
front of her and said talk about the
funny things that happen in your line
of country. So she tells them about the
mother who wanted to dress her child
as a cockroach and she point-blank
refused. Imagine doing that to a child.
And there was the little girl, measuring
five by five, who wanted to be a horse.
It was the only thing, says Mrs. Jen-
nings, she could be. Next morning she
shows herself to a real horse. They are
indistinguishable. Then the mothers, oh,
my goodness, the mothers. They’ll not
pass her name on, not if their Lucinda
or Bobbie wins first prize, you know,
she’s considered personal property. And
it’s not the poor working mothers who
don’t look after things, it’s the rich
Eastern Suburbs ones. Look. Mrs. Jen-
nings produces Kangaroo now mended,
she hopes no one’s allergic to naphtha-
line, which showers down in a silver
cloud. He came back from Rose Bay in
a disgusting condition. She dotes on
her headpieces and goes around open-
ing boxes and pulls out tiaras, plumes,
turbans, gorilla heads, lions, bears, pen-
guins, Little Joey, Mickey and Minnie
Mouse, Donald and Daisy Duck. She
can send a Queen to the ball, the Devil,
too. Isn’t that mask the creepiest thing?
Look at the leer on his face.
And, just as Sheila Jennings, in her
mid-fifties and animated like the
children she serves, flits from one dress-
up to another, ecstatic and smiling, there
is a knock. She freezes. Down here in
this make-believe world. There are two
women at the door. “And do I,” she
asks, “do I know you?” Up there,
remember, it is still sinister old Kings
Cross.

0 LYRIC LOVE!
HALF LOBSTER
AND HALF CHEESE
IT IS generally accepted that in order
to succeed today as a writer or enter-
tainer, or just as a conversationalist, one
must be able to deal confidently with
the topic of sex. Some people, however
(I am one of them), through inhibi-
tions or lack of training, are not very
adept at holding forth on this theme.
They might pay heed to a pronounce-
ment made lately by someone who is
Miss Sue Rhodes, 26, Australian author
of a successful book in the field. She
has declared that “sex should be talked
about as naturally as good food.”
Miss Rhodes’ frank and sensible
attitude seems to mark a genuine ad-
vance. People talk and write about
food without the troubling emotions,
the embarrassment, or the ribaldry that
too often affect their discourse on
amatory matters. How much simpler
and more wholesome to discuss love
in the same tone as one would an
escalope de foie gras a la Talleyrand—
or, on the homely level, a Wimpey-
burger.
From inquiries, I have found that
Miss Rhodes’ view is shared by many
up-to-date authorities novelists,
psychologists, film producers. I was
fortunate enough to obtain an inter-
view with a leading connoisseur of
fine sex, Mr. Neville Slerp, who is,
among other things, vice-president of
the Wine and Sex Society.
As an opening question I asked Mr.
Slerp what he thought of the standard
of sex in Australia.
“It has improved enormously in
recent years,” he replied. “In the not-
so-distant past, very few people here
took it seriously. The same hearty
routine items, accompanied perhaps by
a bottle of beer, were repeated week
after week. The sex was particularly
monotonous in country districts.
“But today things are different.
More time and trouble are taken over
preparation, and a wider range of
varieties is available. I have even
found some quite interesting sex in
country towns not up to the best
city level, perhaps, but with a pleasing
regional character.”
“To what do you attribute this im-
provement in sex?” I asked.
“The influx of migrants has had a
good deal to do with it,” said Mr.
Slerp. “They have brought their dif-
ferent national specialties here, some
of them very piquant and spicy. Also,
their example has encouraged the drink-
ing of wine as an accompaniment to
gracious sex.”
“Do you think education has been a
factor?” I said.
“Very much so,” he replied. “People
today are able to obtain instructional
books on every aspect of the subject.
They range from elementary manuals
like ‘Step-by-Step Sex’ to large, if
rather pedestrian, works of reference
such as ‘The Good Housekeeping Sex
Encyclopaedia.’ There are humorous
divertissements like ‘The Slattern’s Sex
Book’ and lavishly illustrated treatises
like ‘Great Dishes of the World.’ You
can even get packets of colored Sex
Cards.”
“And how has this affected national
habits?”
“It has made people more enterpris-
ing. Whereas they once sampled
novelties only on an occasional night
out, they are trying experiments now
in their own homes.”
I asked Mr. Slerp his views on the
future of sex.
“I believe it will continue to im-
prove,” he said. “A heartening thing
is the increased interest of young people
in the subject. They approach it in an
adventurous spirit they are not con-
tent to follow the same ideas and
methods as their parents.”
“Mr. Slerp,” I said, “could you tell
me of any dish you yourself have
specially enjoyed?”
“Yes,” he said. “I once had a classic
poule Parisienne, pre-heated to just the
right degree with Chateauneuf du Pape.
That was in 1961 a very good year.
It was a memorable experience.” He
smiled ruefully. “But I’m afraid such
exotic treats are out just now. On
doctor’s orders I have been restricted
to good plain sex.”
He looked at his watch. “Will you
excuse me?” he said. “I’m due at a
rehearsal for my television series, ‘Sex
with Slerp’.”
It had been an informative talk, as
modern and down-to-earth as Miss
Rhodes could have desired. And yet
it left me with doubts regarding her
theory that sex should be talked about
like good food. The disadvantage is
that it somehow seems to rob the sub-
ject of excitement. For genuine passion
I still prefer “Anna Karenina” or
even “Sad Movies Always Make Me
Cry” to “The Hostess Cook Book.”


KEEPING AHEAD OF OURSELVES
Comment by ‘Observer'
EVEN IF FOR a while they make a
mess of it, in itself it seems admirable
that Australian politicians should now
attempt to speak up as if Australia had
some identity of its own and some sense
of a particular future. It is time we
developed a new rhetoi'ic, with some
attempts at defining (if arbitrarily) a
sense of national purpose. It is by this
means that our country can finally
lose its provincialism; it is by this
means that new policies can be evalu-
ated and new action have some sense
about it; and it is by this means that
we can become a better nation (or, one
must also admit, a worse one).
For these reasons it was welcome that
the Prime Minister and Mr. Fairbairn,
the Minister for National Development,
both had a go last week at saying what
Australia should be about.
One must praise Mr. Gorton for
saying: “First I am an Australian. I am
proud of being an Australian and I
will work for the Australian nation.”
One must then ask: if we are to be
proud of being Australian, what are
we going to be proud of?
Unfortunately, Mr. Gorton does not
yet seem to have the answers. Given
this, it seems merely to avoid the
question to say, as he did, “We can
produce a nation the like of which
has never been seen on this earth
before.” This would be a fine thing to
say if we had a few facts, or even a
few stated aspirations, to support such
a claim. But what is the point in put-
ting up such a dream without being
specific?
Mr. Gorton seemed to be trying to
find some justification for his claim by
saying that “within a measurable time”
we will be earning SIOOO million in
export income from our mineral re-
sources. But can we build a sense of
nationhood out of the fact that we have
been lucky enough to be sitting on a
big quarry? There is altogether too
much back-patting about the present
development of our mineral resources,
especially since, as Mr. Fairbairn com-
plained, so much of this development
is controlled by foreigners.
What Mr. Gorton probably meant
was that this extra money could be
used to some great purpose other than
the mere making of it. But all of this
money will not be extra spending
money. Quite a proportion of it merely
helps us keep up with rising imports
and saves us the problem of replacing
by harder means our drop in income
from declining export industries. How-
ever, even if Mr. Gorton’s SIOOO million
were a net extra amount, it is not
enough merely to say, “This will so
transform this country that in a decade
or a decade and a half we will be able
to play a full part in our own defence.
We will be able to carry a population
twice that we have now. We will be
more materially significant in the coun-
cils of the world.”
Mere increase in size is something
that can give a New World, ex-colonial
country like ours some sense of purpose.
That Australia still wants to grow is
evident in the general acceptance of
immigration and development programs
which are just about all that is left
of our old national rhetoric although,
as ever, there is fear in these programs
as well as hope. But, even with double
our population, we are not really going
to be all that big.
And, perhaps even more to the point,
the doubling of our population does not
look very likely as a quick objective,
since, for the moment, we cannot fill
even our present immigration targets.
It is all very well for Australia to pat
itself on the back for not standing still
in its economy. But when it comes to
getting immigrants, the question is not
whether we have made economic pro-
gress but whether we have made pro-
gress that keeps us ahead of other
countries. Here the answer is that, in
terms of material progress, perhaps also
in other matters, we are not quite
keeping pace with some other pros-
perous nations. Other countries are
closing up on us or passing us.
Economic progress is not a question of
each country standing on its own
escalator and admiring its progress in
relation to itself. It is all the countries
of the world on the one escalator, some
of them using their legs, and not just
standing still.
One can only praise Mr. Gorton
when he wishes to see an Australia
in which “we will be able to present
a society in which freedom of the in-
dividual is maintained as nowhere
else.” That would indeed be a supreme
achievement. But what is happening
in our country that makes it likely
that we shall so suddenly become the
new, improved Athens of the South? A
nation doesn’t become unparalleled for
the freedom of its individuals because
it has a lot of minerals. If this were
so, the Soviet Union would be well
ahead of us in individual freedom, be-
cause it has much bigger deposits of
mineral resources than we have. Nor does
an increased income from mining and
quarrying mean necessarily that “those
who cannot look after themselves will
be looked after by the community as
a whole.” There are already countries
that are less prosperous than we are,
which, nevertheless, provide better
social services than we do. Our lack of
progress in social services is one of the
reasons why we are not getting all the
immigrants we want. One hopes here
that the Prime Minister has something
in mind that he will tell us about soon.
But on present evidence we are slip-
ping down the scale in the quality and
quantity of social services.
Mr. Gorton seemed to be making a
closer approach to the manufacture of
new ideals for Australia in two other
parts of his speech when he spoke of
a society “where racial divisions don’t
exist as elsewhere” and when he said
something about the “need to make new
approaches to the neighbors surround-
ing us.” But what did he mean?
When he spoke of a lack of racial
divisions, did he mean that we intend
to show the world that we can provide
a society in which people of different
races can live together without gross
intolerance? Or did he mean, simply,
that by keeping races of non-European
origin out of Australia we could avoid
racial tension? If he meant the latter —
how can we be proud of the fact that
by not letting other races into Australia
we avoid racial tension? There is not
much to boast about in being a kind of
Lucky South Africa—a white man’s
land with only one percent of boongs.
It is possible that Mr. Gorton had
something specific in mind when he
spoke of making new approaches to “the
neighbors surrounding us.” One might
carp and point out that we are a notably
unsurrounded nation. It is true that we
have Indonesia to our north, but to our
east there is only New Zealand, to our
west the nearest neighbor is Mauritius,
and to the south we are hemmed in by
the Antarctic continent. However, if Mr.
Gorton meant that we might play a
more generous and-neighborly role with
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the
Philippines, the only criticism one can
make is to ask the question: why not
start now?
Who was largely responsible this year
for not increasing considerably the
degree of Australian economic assistance
to Indonesia? Who has been largely
responsible for holding up implementa-
tions of the proposals of the Defence
Minister and the External Affairs
Minister for giving Singapore and
Malaysia the particular help they have
asked us to give them? It has been
one of the curious features of Mr.
Gorton’s Prime Ministership so far that
most of his policies are still lurking
in the crystal ball. Great events are
coming up in a decade or so, but as.
yet we haven’t seen anything very
specific that is going to come up this-
year.
If all this has seemed to attack Mr.
Gorton under the disguise of praising
him, it is because, in a way never before
known in Australia, he has gone on for
most of his first year of office as Prime
Minister looking like a beginner. But
for all one knows, he may have begin-
ner’s luck. If he wants to be proud to
be an Australian, that’s a good start.
But it is not from our past that he is
likely to find much substance for his
pride, but from our possible future —as
a nation of European origin appending
the southern appendages of Asia.

LEAVING IT ALL TO THE "WITLESS MEN"
Comment by Alan Reid
DESPITE the Gorton Government be-
ing under pressure on the F-111, wheat,
and other matters, the Federal Par-
liamentary Labor Party is showing
signs of disintegration and demoralisa-
tion on a scale not matched for years.
The malaise goes much deeper than
Calwell versus Cairns, rows on redis-
tribution, and such matters. Labor
veteran Senator Pat Kennedy, Vic.,
last week put his finger unerringly
upon part, possibly a big part, of the
trouble.
At the instigation of Opposition
Leader Gough Whitlajn, Queenslander
Manfred Cross had moved a motion
in the Caucus referring the electoral
redistribution proposals back to the
ALP Federal Executive, with a recom-
mendation that the minority report
for that State of Mr. Commissioner
Weise be supported in the Parliament
as “it most closely conforms with objec-
tions lodged by the Queensland branch
of the Australian Labor Party.”
Protested Kennedy: “You’ll have to
start making a few decisions for your-
selves. You can’t go passing responsi-
bility for decisions you should be mak-
ing to the ALP Federal Executive ad
the time. How can we ever expect to
win Government if we go running to
the Executive every time we have to
?nake a decision? Do we submit every
tinpot piece of legislation to them for
their decision? In such an event, how
can we ever claim the right to run this
country?”
There is a grotesqueness to the whole
situation. Whitlam once described the
Executive as being composed of “wit-
less men.” Yet it is to them that mat-
ters are being increasingly referred.
Though nominally it was the South
Australian ALP Executive that sought
ALP Federal intervention in the
Calwell-Cairns conflict over who was
to get the seat of Melbourne (a con-
flict now resolved in Calwell’s favor),
the South Australian move was inspired
by Labor parliamentarians.
Personally, I think that it is a pity
that Cairns, once he had made his
“Melbourne or nothing” declaration
and announced that he would retire
from the Parliament if he missed out
on the Melbourne preselection, compro-
mised and agreed to nominate for
Lalor. But he did not want Federal
intervention.
I believe that it would have been
healthier for the ALP from the long-
term viewpoint if he had said that he
repudiated Federal intervention on his
behalf, that he was going to a ballot
in Melbourne, as he was entitled to go,
and that while the rules of the Party
were being observed (and there is no
suggestion that, however clumsily the
Calwell - Cairns affair was being
handled, there had been any departure
from the Victorian rules) he was pre-
pared to accept the outcome of the
ballot.
A number of Labor parliamentarians,
additional to Kennedy, expressed un-
easiness at last week’s Caucus meeting
about the constant reference to the ALP
Federal Executive of issues on which
the Parliamentary Labor Party should
properly make the decisions.
And while I have been a persistent
and consistent critic of the ALP Federal
Executive and its authoritarian control
over Labor Parliamentarians, I cannot
help but feel some sympathy for it in
present circumstances. The Executive
has no desire to deal with many of the
things being referred to it. But in the
absence of any inclination by the Parlia-
mentary Party to take its own decisions
it has to fill the leadership vacuum.
It was the ALP Federal Executive
which made the decision that the pre-
sent redistribution proposals now before
the Parliament should not be opposed.
Personally, I think it was stupid to
make such a decision before the boun-
daries were finally fixed. It was not
even a pro forma decision that the Gov-
ernment could disregard because of
superior numbers. With the Democratic
Labor Leader Senator Gair (Queens-
land) bitterly critical of the Queens-
land redistribution, and the DLP having
the balance of power in the Senate, it
was within Labor’s power to force a
reassessment.
It was not a decision that strictly
speaking was appropriate for the ALP
Federal Executive to make. It was
something that was more appropriate
to Parliamentary Party decision.
But the Federal Executive members
probably worked out that if they did
not make a decision the Federal Par-
liamentary Labor Party would not make
one. The ALP Federal Executive is
increasingly having forced upon it the
role of dictator over Labor.
At last week’s Caucus, Senator Lionel
Murphy, Labor Leader in the Senate,
was fulminating about the unfairness
of the proposed N.S.W. electoral re-
distribution, which many good Labor
judges believe will put Labor in the
position of needing an avalanche
rather than a swing to produce a Labor
Government. “I would not have a bar
of it,” thundered Murphy.
Quiet Eric Costa, from Banks in
N.S.W., pointed out that Murphy,
Whitla'm, the Deputy Leader Lance
Barnard, and the Deputy Senate Leader
Sam Cohen were all members of the
ALP Federal Executive which had
passed the motion instructing the Fed-
eral Parliamentary Labor Party not to
oppose the redistribution. That motion
was passed in the ALP Federal Execu-
tive, of which these men were members,
if not unanimously at least without
dissent.

AUSTRALIA
Either way, it’s up in the air
COULD A 1968 Australian election
ca’mpaign be much more than rhetoric
and the F-lll? There just isn’t time
for Mr. Gorton to bring out any con-
crete and detailed proposals for foreign
policy or welfare reform.
Mr. Gorton provided a sample of
his election style in a speech to the
Henty electorate council in Moorabin,
Victoria: “Today in Australia we live
in the most exciting time that this
country has ever known. There have
been changes over past years, of course,
but on the whole they have been
gradual . . . but just recently there has
been a sudden explosion in this nation,
an explosion which has not yet reached
its height, and the end results of which
we can only dream about.”
Obviously affected by his journeyings
around the development projects of the
North, he spoke of these and said: “This
will so transform this country that in a
decade or a decade and a half we will
be able, even more than we are now,
to play a full part in our own defence.
We will be able to carry a population
perhaps twice as great as that which we
have now, and we will be able mater-
ially to be significant or more signi-
ficant in the councils of the world.”
He also developed themes of the
need for Australian nationalism: “For
so long we stood not really as a nation
in our own right, but as a nation the
people of whom spoke of ‘home’ and
meant another nation, meant Great
Britain ... it is essential that we should
develop a feeling of nationhood.
“I hope,” he concluded his speech,
“you will all help me in the years
ahead to foster this feeling of real
nationalism and I believe you will. I
believe the Australian people want it
and I believe that with it and with the
opportunities that lie within our grasp,
we will be able to bring into existence
on this continent a nation which will
redress the balances in Europe and some
countries in Asia and which, given wise
material management and a proper
spiritual approach to the responsibili-
ties toward individuals, will become a
nation the like of which may never
have been seen on this earth before.”
This is pure Gortonese; evidently he
intends to go into an election ca’mpaign
on this sort of material.
He will have to check out a few facts
if he does. He will find, for instance,
that a doubling of the population will
require a sixfold increase in immigra-
tion over present rates, if it is to be
achieved in a decade, a fourfold
increase if it is to be achieved in a
decade and a half.
It is an interesting exercise in the
analysis of the Australian electorate to
speculate whether this sort of election-
eering is going to work.
Mr. Gorton simply has not the time
to provide the electorate with hard con-
crete policies because he hasn’t time to
work them out. He has committees
working away on health costs and
medical insurance. But their reports
cannot be ready for another month at
least, and then the views of the
Treasury will have to be got.
He has his “strategic basis,” the situ-
ation report on which the Government
has to produce its long-awaited and
!much publicised “strategic reassess-
ment.” But his Minister for External
Affairs, his Treasurer, and his Deputy
Prime Minister are all out of the coun-
try, and he cannot have been serious
in suggesting in the House last week
that it could, if necessary, be settled
over the telephone or with teleprinter
messages.
He and Mr. McMahon have been
sold on one of the long-time pet pro-
jects of Treasury head, Sir Richard
Randall, which is to lower the rate
of income taxation on people in the
middle and upper-middle income
ranges. That can be promised, but
people will want to know where the
replacement money is coming from.
The problem is that it has been a
year completely devoid of all but rou-
tine business legislation (except for the
unfortunate amendments to the National
Service Bill). This means that Mr.
Gorton hasn’t much of a record to cam-
paign on. Which leaves him only with
his rhetoric. His manner of beefing it
emphatically out probably goes down
well. But it may be that Australians
are rather cynical of politicians talking
of an Australia a decade and a half
hence, of grand decisions for the
’eighties. Or is it possible that they are
not so down to earth as they sometimes
claim, and that they will respond to a
certain amount of vision-making?
Does it matter? Could Mr. Whitlam
possibly win an election with the Labor
Party in its present mess?
So,me of his supporters last week
claimed that he was doing well, “con-
sidering the intractable material we
have to deal with.” Said one of them:
“He’ll have to concentrate his campaign
on the deficiencies of the Government,
trying to divert attention completely
from the schisms within his Party. And
his main piece of propaganda against
the Government is going to be the
F-lll.”
Could the F-11l become the VIP
aircraft affair of 1968? As Attorney
General Nigel Bowen was crossing
Kings Hall in Parliament last week
he saw the portly figure of Vince Gair,
Leader of the DLP. “You kept me
John Gorton at the Anzac Memorial
last week ...which vision?


working all weekend,” Bowen com-
plained, saying he had worked into two
nights on F-11l documents, preparing
for their tabling in the Senate. Defence
Minister Fairhall, too, said he was fed
to the teeth with documents. “I’ve got
them running out of my nose and
mouth and ears,” he said. The work of
the Treasury, Air, Defence, and Attor-
ney General’s Departments has been
proceeding virtually at a half rate
while departmental staffs have been
working through the five tons of docu-
ments relating to the F-111.
The names Gilpatrick and Mundt
are going to become household words
in an election campaign. The DLP
and the ALP are both going to make a
great deal of use of proceedings in the
U.S. Senate Committee on the F-111,
where Senator Mundt asked Assistant
Secretary of Defence, Roswell Gilpat-
rick: “Just what kind of a contract do
you have with Australia? Are they
going to buy planes willy-nilly? If your
figures are $2 million off, and the cost
is $7.5 million, are they going to buy
them at $lO million? Have they any
top limitation, or do they simply say:
“We’ll take two dozen planes at what-
ever price they are.” Answer “That
is the way the agreement reads.”
Cairns ...300 word announcement in a basement room
HIS EYES bloodshot and Bagged by
sleeplessness and tension, his skin
eczemary and spotted, Dr. Jim Cairns
walked into a basement conference
room to make his 300-word announce-
ment.
He glumly handed roneoed copies to
pressmen and then fumblingly read it
out for the television. The story, which
he could have condensed to a sen-
tence, was: “In the interests of Party
unity, I am abandoning my confronta-
tion with Arthur Calwell over pre-
selection for the seat of Melbourne and
have decided to go for the uncontested
Lalor.”
But there was also another strong
factor (although Dr. Cairns denied it).
The headcount showed that he was
about to be done by Mr. Calwell, about
20 votes to ten, according to several
Labor Party people.
Mr. Calwell is the symbol of old-
style Leftism and intransigence, whereas
it is feared in some Victorian Labor
circles that Dr. Cairns is potentially
another Whitlam, who would sacrifice
something called principle for power.
Furthermore, there was a lot of simple
sentiment in favor of the former leader,
Mr. Calwell. Why should the old bloke
be thrown out? He served the Victorian
Party and its principles well and
loyally.
DUNTROON
GIVEN THE FREEZE
IT IS A military truism that it is the
quality of leadership that counts most
in the performance of the troops. There
has been very little criticism of the
quality of leadership in the Australian
Armed Forces, but there is now increas-
ing criticism of the quantity. There just
isn’t even the officer establishment
needed for the .modest nine battalion
(8000 riflemen) army Australia has
today, let alone the nucleus for an ex-
pansion.
The Army is desperately short of
middle-level officers. For example,
while the Army structure provides for
1753 positions for captains, only two-
thirds of these are filled, and of 1252
positions for major, 200 are unfilled.
The Royal Military College at Dun-
troon is the main source of officer re-
cruits, but a remarkable fact of the
recent general defence build-up is that
Duntroon has been given the freeze.
Between 40 and 50 cadets are being
graduated each year as officers, no more
than right through the 19505, and there
is no building for expansion.
There have been plans to expand
Duntroon from the present 250 cadets
to 450, and a start was made in 1964
on providing facilities. This would have
allowed annual officer output to rise
from 40 or 50 to 70 or 80. But with
the college now being negotiated affili-
ate status to the University of N.S.W.,
and more recently with plans being
made for an integration of officer
training in all three Services, all ex-
pansion plans have been shelved for
the time being. Two thirds of appli-
cants for officer training continue to
be turned away each year and facilities
for new courses continue to be unpro-
vided.
For two years now there have been
mutterings of dissatisfaction at Dun-
troon. But because of the strict military
discipline which applies to the staff,
there have been no public complaints.
But last week, for the first time, there
was strong public protest at Govern-
ment neglect. The college’s annual re-
port is full of complaints about in-
adequacies; of which there are some:
“For a variety of reasons, it has not
been possible to bring about the devel-
opment of laboratory, classroom, and
staff facilities to keep pace with the
courses. It has been necessary to resort
to improvisations . . . the college must
face a further period in which certain
essential facilities will have to be met
by improvisation . . . shortage of staff
in the Department of Engineering con-
tinued to present difficulties . . .
“The academic departments have
prepared detailed statements of their
requirements for accommodation and
facilities for incorporation in the user
requirement for the college. Their
statements underline the serious defici-
encies in the current classroom and
laboratory facilities . . . The request for
an increased establishment of technical
and laboratory staff referred to in the
last annual report has not yet been
approved, and two of the three per-
manent staff have obtained appoint-
ments elsewhere at higher salaries . . .
Good housekeeping is difficult under
conditions of overcrowding, lack of
storage space, and inadequate support-
ing staff . . .”
There is also growing criticism in the
Defence Department of Cabinet’s slow-
ness in dealing with proposals for allevi-
ating Duntroon’s problems. A senior
person last week pointed out that
Cabinet has now had a key report on
integration and development of officer
training for over three months. This


report, by Sir Leslie Martin, former
chairman of the Universities Commis-
sion, Sir Hugh Ennor, Secretary of
the Com’monwealth Department of
Education, and Sir John Wilton, chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recom-
mends without reservation the estab-
lishment of a new joint Services
academy at Duntroon and the aban-
donment of the separate RAAF and
Navy establishments.
It also proposes a big expansion
program to overcome the officer short-
age. The report was fully endorsed by
the Chiefs of Staffs of the Services and
the Defence Committee. But Cabinet
hasn’t got around to looking at it yet.
STATE VISIT
PARK ON POSTURE
PRESIDENT PARK of South Korea
arrived in Australia last week with a
clear message urging the Australian
Government to maintain its interest in
the future of Asia and avoid a retreat
into a “Fortress Australia” posture. “I
would like to reiterate the truism,” he
told Members of Parliament at an
official luncheon, “that isolation is not
an effective means to preserve indepen-
dence. Isolated weakness invites the
wanton avarice of the aggressors ... I
am certain that generations to come
will applaud the important role the
Australians are playing today not only
as creators of a new Pacific civilisation
but also as guardians of peace in this
region.”
The Koreans were very upset in
February this year when Mr. Gorton,
in an off-the-cuff remark at a Press
briefing, virtually committed the Gov-
ernment to a policy of neutrality in a
new Korean conflict. Diplomatic
specialists pointed out that this could
be used by hawks in North Vietnam
to prove that the U.S. would be isolated
in its support for South Korea, and as
an argument for invasion.
President Park succeeded in getting
the Government to agree to a passage
in the communique recalling the 1953
16-power declaration that “if there was
a renewal of armed attack challenging
again the principles of the United
Nations, they would again be united
and prompt to assist.” The Australian
Government has been firmed in its atti-
tude to Korea by the knowledge that
the Japanese, despite the absence of
any formal agreement with South
Korea, have let it be known that they
will move their powerful army to repel
any North Korean invasion.
President Park also initiated a num-
ber of co-operative schemes between
the two countries. An arrangement with
Sir William Gunn’s cattle firm to join
in a joint venture with Korean livestock
firms is to seek official blessing, and
access is to be given to the big Korean
plywood factories to sources of timber
in New Guinea. Furthermore, Korea,
after Indonesia, is to be the second
country with which Australia will sign
Thoughtful pose by President Park in Canberra's Vietnam Gallery
a cultural agreement. A gift of wheat
as drought relief to Korea was also
announced, and Mr. Gorton is to return
the visit of President Park, with Febru-
ary stated to be a possible date.
RHODESIA
PAYING THE PRICE
THE SO-CALLED “Rhodesia lobby”
in the Liberal Party won significant vic-
tories in Federal Parliament last week
whe;n they got a significant statement
from Government Ministers admitting
that expediency rather than distaste
for Mr. Smith’s regime was dominant
in the Government’s decision to support
UN sanctions against Rhodesia.
External Affairs Minister Hasluck
said in answer to a question from Mr.
E. St. John that he deplored “partisan-
ship either for one side or the other”
in Rhodesia. He made it clear the
Government had no faith in the effect-
iveness of sanctions and wished the
British Government had not magnified
the issue by referring it to the United
Nations. Curiously, he failed to state a
Government attitude, saying that “the
majority of members of the Govein-
ment side” believed that the UDI was
“illegal” and that the Smith regime had
not got international recognition. Basic
constitutional responsibility, they
thought, rested with the British, and
their objective of “a constitution which
gives an opportunity to all sections of
the population to participate in Gov-
ernment” was “a desirable aim and
also a necessity of practical politics.”
But the greatest coup for the
Rhodesia lobby was in getting the meek
and mild Attorney-General, Nigel
Bowen, to say that Government Minis-
ters had agreed to the sanctions “with
profound distaste,” thereby suggesting
some sort of sympathy with the white-
settler Government against the mass of
the disenfranchised population, which it
Bowen ...“profound distaste”
now seems destined to be subjected to
the servitude of apartheid.
Asian embassies in Canberra reacted
with dismay, saying this was a blow to
Australia’s prestige. Communist coun-
tries are expected to take up the state-
ments and parade them as evidence of
Australian racism.
The truth is that the Government has
handled the whole business badly.
Cabinet discussed it late on the evening
of June 4, just before Mr. Gorton de-
parted for his Asian trip. They agreed
that Australia would have to apply the
sanctions, but sent instructions to
various Government departments to
investigate how Australia could do the
minimum by way of actual enforce-
ment. At the same time, to placate the
Rhodesia lobby, the word was put
around that Australia was going to try
to get out of applying the sanctions
with full force. For instance, it was
said, Australia could still sell wheat,
foodstuffs, and pharmaceuticals to
Rhodesia under clauses in the UN

resolution allowing sale of goods on
humanitarian grounds.
Despite a decision being made, it
was not formally announced, in an
attempt to stave off backbench Rho-
desia lobby criticism. In fact, the delay
only made things worse. It angered the
backbenchers as an attempt at evasion
and made their attacks more fierce,
moving their criticism closer to election
time with all the damaging evidence
of disunity on the Government side,
and it angered Liberals like Mr. Kevin
Cairns and Mr. St. John, who want
a strong, hard line against Rhodesia.
The truth is that a concerted
campaign by a small organised minority
has worked well on Government par-
liamentarians. Australia-Rhodesia Asso-
ciations in every State have been extra-
ordinarily active in letterwriting, peti-
tioning, and putting various forms of
pressure on Members. At public meet-
ings they have been inundated by
questions, so much so that some believe
that Rhodesian sanctions are an issue
which really exercises the minds of the
Australian public. One Member last
week seriously put forward the propo-
sition that it had displaced Vietnam as
an issue of public concern.
“It’s rather like the way the pro-
Communists operate on the Labor
Party. The pro-Fascists simply out-
organise the moderates on things like
Rhodesia,” said one Liberal parliamen-
tarian last week. Responding to what
they believed was a groundswell of pro-
Smith sentiment, many Liberal Minis-
ters decided that the wisest thing to do
was to try to have it both ways: to
agree to sanctions, but with a show of
maximum reluctance.
Australia is likely to pay a price for
this ambivalence and expediency in
increased suspicion of its administration
of New Guinea and stronger pressures
for a premature grant of self-
Government.
At the same time, the Rhodesia lobby
is not to be silenced. Mr. Jim Killen,
its leading representative in Parliament,
has declared he will fight on. He has
tied up a number of External Affairs
officers with a flood of questions. And
incidents are bound to arise from time
to time like requests by Rhodesian
passport holders for visas to visit Aus-
tralia. Refusal, as required by the UN,
will give the lobby specific and news-
making issues on which to campaign.
VICTORIA
BOLT FROM BOLTE
THE PLAIN MAN’S premier, Sir
Henry Bolte, is no shy violet when it
comes to standing up for his own. Vic-
toria’s Premier-Treasurer for 14 years,
he is by now a past-rnaster of a droll
form of Canberra-baiting. Last week’s
Budget was no exception.
In the space of a mere 18 pages of
his terse prose, Sir Henry accused the
Commonwealth Government of “plain
dishonesty,” of perpetrating a “confi-
dence trick” on the States, of “short-


Bolte...“plain dishonesty ”
changing” them, of “filching” taxing
rights, and of “usurious practices.”
This was a stepped-up version of
the 1967-68 fulminations. In the last
Budget speech he let loose on the
Federal Government’s handling of the
revenue grants, but with plans up his
sleeve for the introduction of a turn-
over tax along the line of the Western
Australian legislation, he seemed
to think it was unnecessary to take the
scolding too far.
This year his aspersion was chiefly
directed at Canberra’s sharp methods of
bookkeeping. Beginning with the point
that one of the major costs on the State
Budget was repayment of loans and
the interest on them, he said that the
Commonwealth had adopted the prac-
tice of including the total su,m of State
borrowings as part of its own expen-
diture.
This was “plain dishonesty.” Borrow-
ings increased the debt of the States,
but had nothing to do with the Nat-
ional Debt. Indeed, said Sir Henry, it
was the States who were now carrying
the burden of the National Debt.
When the amounts advanced to the
States under the Housing Agreement
and the moneys held by the Common-
wealth in its own securities were sub-
tracted from Canberra’s version of the
National Debt, the real figure amounted
to only $395 million. In contrast, the
States owed $9821 million.
Not only were the States paying the
great bulk of the interest on the
National Debt, the Commonwealth was
“making vast profits out of its money-
lending operations.” By the “usurious
practice” of lending money raised from
taxation at no cost, Canberra was
exacting a cool 150 percent profit.
“Good business for the Commonwealth,
but rather tough on the States,” said
Sir Henry.
All this was more than mud in the
eye of Federal Treasurer McMahon,
who made a mid-month appeal for
Liberal Party unity on the issue of
Federal - State financial arrangements.
It was an effective, if unsubtle, con-
tribution to Mr. Askin’s campaign to
have the system of Federal disburse-
ments completely overhauled: A sys-
tem which has reduced State politics
to “yes, but where will the money
come from?”
On the day after his speech, Sir
Henry added a final flourish. The only
policy change of his Budget was to
exempt primary producers from land
tax and to increase the charge on large
commercial landholders. Sir Henry
said the increase would not be heavy—
besides, half could be claimed as a
deduction from the Commonwealth.
OPUS DEI
ATTACK AND DEFENCE
THE National Union of Australian
University Students has condemned the
controversial Roman Catholic organis-
ation Opus Dei, after receiving a report
from a former president of the New-
man Society at the University of New
South Wales, Mr. Mark Lyons. The
NUAUS council decided unanimously
that it opposes Opus Dei control of
Roman Catholic colleges at universities
in Australia, and “regrets that Cardinal
Gilroy has seen fit to encourage this
movement to enter the Australian
context.”
O.D. (Work of God) is a loosely knit
organisation of laymen and priests. Its
President General, lawyer Monsig-
nor Josemaria Escriva, founded it in
Madrid in 1928. It has become “the
most controversial Spanish ecclesiasti-
cal invention since the Jesuits.” Many
Spaniards call it “Octopus Dei.” Now
headquartered in Rome, O.D. now has
more than 60,000 members, is active in
68 countries, and runs more than 200
university halls of residence, study
centres, and adult education and
cultural centres.
In 1963, Cardinal Gilroy invited O.D.
to build and run the Warrane Catholic
college at the University of N.S.W. O.D.
hopes it will open in 1970. The Com-
monwealth and State Governments will
pay 75 percent of its $1.2 million cost.
Its spiritual counsellor Father James
Albrecht, director Mr. George Block,
and assistant director Mr. Owen Hughes
came to Australia from the United
States after the Cardinal’s invitation.
They are running the Nairana Cultural
Centre, for students and high school
students, opposite the University of
N.S.W. Chicagoan Mr. Hughes, 29, who
joined O.D. while studying at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology, is a
lecturer in mechanical engineering at
the university.
The NUAUS Council carried its
resolution believing, with Mr. Lyons,
that “the operations of 0.D., particu-
larly its method of recruitment, mean
that it directly opposes the right of
every individual student to a free
choice of his vocation and beliefs.”
(“O.D. never has, does not, and will
never recruit,” said Mr. Hughes last
week. “Freedom is the thing that
characterises the colleges of O.D. War-
rane is not just for Catholics.”)
Mr. Lyons suggested O.D. aimed to
achieve public power for the church
by secret and other means, and then to
use this power to implement what it
believed to be church policy. O.D.’s
secrecy, he said, made it very hard to
get “any information on its size and
rts organisational structure.” He said
that O.D. concentrated on recruiting
mainly from the intellectual elite. This
had led to it rapidly becoming very
rich as well as very powerful. It did
most of its recruiting in universities
and teed-up in high schools.
To this, Mr. Hughes replies, “There’s
absolutely nothing political about O.D.
Its members reflect society, all incomes,
ages, education, profession, and occupa-
tion.” He says the Australian member-
ship is very small—it’s just some people
at the university, at Nairana, and
around and about Sydney ... no more
than a few dozen at the most. O.D.
has no plans to expand in Australia.
It’s something whose aims are purely
supernatural.
NEW GUINEA
WHAT "MUTUAL" MEANS
TO SAY “Wages must not be allowed
to rise above present levels unless there
is matching increase in productivity,”
as the Administrator of Papua and New
Guinea, Mr. Hay, did last week, would
be an acceptable argument before the
Arbitration Commission in Australia,
where it would be hardly necessary for
anyone to point to the concomitant
that the means (machinery, techniques,
etc.) to make such an increase possible
should be available. To say it in New

CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE
RIESLING GRAPE
Often referred to as Rhine
Riesling to distinguish it
from Semi I lon and other
varieties. A small round
greenish-yellow grape turning
to gold on the sunny side.
Moderate yield, ripens early,
soft and juicy with a tough,
translucent skin. The leaf is
medium size and round with
blunt teeth and three lobes,
rarely five. Rhine Riesling
is distinctive in having
small, tight, cylindrical
bunches with short stalks
and spotted grapes. Usually
winged or shouldered and held
tightly to the cane.
Yalumba Carte d’Or is a true-to-
type delicate dry white produced
from selected Rhine Riesling
grapes grown on the gentle slopes
of the Angaston, Eden Valley and
Springton districts of the
Barossa Valley. Bottled early in
the vintage year, usually August/
September, then allowed to mellow
in the century-old cellars of
Yalumba. A consistent prize
winner which, we feel sure, will
have winning ways with yom
and your friends.

Guinea, adding, “The way for people
to get more money is to produce more”
may have sounded like a simple and
vital statement of Federal dogma to its
orator, while once again having a prob-
able dulling and puzzling effect on
native ears.
It was as clear as though he had
been answering Mr. Hay from across
the room when Mr. Michael Somare,
in addresses in Sydney and Melbourne
last week, stressed the poverty of New
Guinea’s bases for productivity
increase. For one thing, his country
needed to be developed; needed more
roads, communications, industry; more
highly skilled technical help to open
up the country and train its people to
do the job themselves, needed overseas
investment; and, among other things,
economic independence—that is, the
right and power to determine how and
where it should spend its income.
While that income remains largely
an annual grant from Australia, the
Commonwealth insists on complete con-
trol of the New Guinea Treasury and
Budget, and will continue to do so for
at least the next five years, while it
grants New Guinea a total of $lOOO
million, carrying the World Bank’s out-
line for its development one stage
further. The Territory’s House of
Assembly has had to agree to that,
phrased as “mutual co-operation,” to
assure the grant from year to year.
While this will seem fair enough to
most Australians, there is a joker in
the pack. Everyone concerned knows
that one of Mr. Somare’s conditions,
overseas investment, has remained
most elusive; it amounted to only $lO
million in a very recent year. And
while the country’s lack of development
bases are one reason, perhaps a more
immediate one is the hesitancy among
international investors to risk money
in a developing country where the
danger of expropriation on indepen-
dence exists. One way to alter this
would be to declare a sufficiently dis-
tant date for independence; but another
would be to allow the New Guinea
House of Assembly to at least decide on
the principles of its annual Budget
before advancing to complete control of
it within the next five years, so that
potential investors might be able to
assess their risks, probably as very small
ones, in dealing with the New Guineans.
In this context Mr. Hay’s oratory (or,
more truly, Canberra’s) asking New
Guineans to produce more, without
other tools to do the job than their
native muscles and wills, borders on the
hypocritical. During the coming five
years, Australia’s $lOOO million will do
marvels toward making New Guinea
a better country for investment, with
a complex of higher earnings, taxes,
and tariffs working well. Without a so-
far unthought-of kind of “mutual co-
operation” from Australia, the $lOOO
million will attract no huge investment;
and whether, or how far, giving Korean
plywood companies access to New
Guinea timber will fill the bill remains
to be -heard —if the Assembly is
allowed to debate it after the fiat.

INTERNATIONAL
Will the tanks roll away?
A TAUT battle of nerves between the
Russian and Czech Governments,
mainly concerned with Mr. Dubcek’s
retention of the leadership of his
people, seems to have swung in the
Czechs’ favor for the moment. In such
a long-drawn and complicated struggle,
it would be rash to call it a victory.
Better to say the Czechs have avoided
defeat for the time being. The upshot
is believed to be that Mr. Dubcek,
First Secretary of the Czechoslovak
Communist Party and the popular
leader of the nation, will head the
Czech delegation in its crucial talks in
Moscow.
In Moscow there will inevitably be
a further wrangle about the leadership,
besides some hard talking about the
effectiveness of the Czech measures to-
ward “normalisation” and on the
departure date of the occupation forces
of the Warsaw Pact.
It seems that the Russians, repre-
sented by their special envoy in Prague,
Mr. Vassily Kuznetsov, have vigorously
opposed the idea of Mr. Dubcek head-
ing the delegation as a first step
eventually to getting rid of him
altogether. But the remarkable and
continuing solidarity of the Czech
leaders appears for the moment to have
rebuffed this move. By way of show-
ing that they remained unruffled and
unbowed, President Svoboda, Mr. Dub-
cek and their colleagues broke off the
argument last weekend and set off for
a visit to the Brno Trade Fair, where
the crowds greeted them warmly.
Having blundered into the country
on the strength of hopelessly bad infor-
mation about Czech popular feeling,
the Russians will now have a much
more realistic appraisal of the truth
from their expert, Mr. Kuznetsov. On
this evidence, as diplomatic and other
sources see it, they have two choices.
The first is to lay on the iron hand,
install a military government, and try
to justify it by propaganda. The second
is to find a tactful compromise that will
do a minimum of further damage to
Russian prestige in the Communist
world, and withdraw as quietly as pos-
sible, having taken necessary face-
saving measures.
At present they seem to be seriously
working on the latter. But no neutral
diplomat in Prague has excluded the
idea that the tanks could roll again if
the Russians become too frustrated.
The Russian problem is an intensely
difficult one, with nothing less than
the remaining unity and leadership of
the Communist world at stake. The
Czech leaders have obviously sized up
this aspect thoroughly. It’s not only
romantic heroism that keeps their chins
up.
The vital coming event, on which a
In the green belt outside Prague, where Russian tanks withdrew last week, soldiers
perform maintenance tasks and minor repairs
great deal hangs, is the proposed con-
gress of the world Communist Parties.
It’s believed here that the Russians
would still like to hold it and that this,
above all, colors their present diplo-
macy. If they are going to meet, then
the Russians must find a whole series of
answers and justifications that will
satisfy their foreign comrades. They
must also withdraw the tanks by the
end of October and have found some
apologia for them. Or else they will
come under devastating criticism. The
theory is that the Russians will find
some way of taking out all occupation
troops by October 28, which is the
fiftieth anniversary of the founding of
Czechoslovakia.
There is evidence on all sides that
change is now in the Czechs’ blood and
simply cannot be moved. The censor-
ship is supposed to be tough, but articles
in the weeklies show that the spirit of
the liberal revolution is still basically
retained, even though there is a good
deal of Marxist dogmatising.
What are the chances of a quisling
regime? The idea of replacing Mr.
Dubcek seems to imply an interest in
this. But it does not seem to be on. The
most favored candidate to replace Mr.
Dubcek is Mr. Gustav Husak, a lawyer
by training, a man who has been in
prison under both the Stalinists and
under the Nazis, but who has shown
strong Party loyalty.
Where Mr. Dubcek is candid and
innocent and sincere with the people,
Husak is more of a politician—a tough
dissembler who knows the Moscow score
better. The Czech people would take
to him rather slowly because of his
Slovak nationalism, but there are assur-
ances that he is no collaborator. Czech
unity is just as it was.
Moscow’s hesitation and confusion
are the result not only of the tenacity
and resourcefulness displayed by the
Czechs but also of the repercussions the
Czech crisis has had on the high-ranking
and articulate membership of the Soviet
Communist Party itself.
The key to the problem lies in the
Central Committee of the Soviet Party*
numbering 195 members and 165 can-
didate members. The Central Com-
mittee has not met since the Warsaw
Pact troops crossed into Czechoslovakia
on August 21. This may be because the
balance of political forces within the
Central Committee has become un-
certain and attitudes have not yet
crystallised enough to enable it to adopt
a clear-cut posture.
The members of the politburo and
the presidium have been dealing with
the Czech crisis on their own respon-
sibility, but they cannot ignore the
political atmosphere within the Central
Committee. Indeed, they reflect its.
divisions in their own ranks.
As a result of the Czech crisis, the
old dividing line between Liberals and
Conservatives has dissolved. The new
line is between those favoring caution
and commonsense and other personally
ambitious men who want a tough
policy.
But the new line-up is far from firm.
This is because the degree of authority
possessed by the Central Committee
has steadily increased since the days
of Stalin, with the important effect that,
not only in theory but in practice,
the Central Committee is where real
political power lies and as a result of
this individual members of the Com-
mittee have become more powerful.
The membership of the Committee
for the most part consists of national
and regional Party leaders, high-ranking
industrial and professional men, some
of them undoubtedly with ambitions of
their own. Most of them have very
little experience or knowledge of the
outside world.
Till now, it has been all too readily
assumed that political liberalisation and
modernisation of the economy would
create a new industrial and professional
body of men who would automatically


move toward radical change. This
assumption has proved to be mistaken.
The new men are mainly interested
in establishing operational freedom in
their own limited sphere. A manager
permitted to run his factory in his own
way becomes committed to maintaining
the status quo outside his own sphere,
les! it upset the stability of the system
and adversely affect his own freedom.
This explains why the Central Com-
mittee should be in favor of efforts to
discipline Czechoslovakia and opposed
to any revolutionary change there. But
the price paid for it has no doubt set
some of the members thinking about the
wisdom and desirability of the whole
exercise.

AUSTRALIA'S IMAGE
THE DAMNING SILENCE
THOUGH ALL Western reactions to
the Sabah crisis (see page 31) were
suitably hedged with the honorable
exception of the British Commander-in-
Chief, Far-East Australia once again
managed to come out of the week
worst. All major international news
agencies carried the news that the
Sabah dispute was likely to be a pres-
sure toward future Australian with-
drawal and isolationism.
Asked by The Bulletin to comment
upon this when he returned from Bang-
kok on Sunday, Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Tun Razak said:
“There is no reason why it (the dis-
pute) should be (such a pressure). This
is an isolated incident; it was bound to
come. We are bound to have differences
among the countries of this region. Aus-
tralia has a vital part to play in the
maintaining of peace and stability of
the region. I don’t think it should
affect their decision in any way.”
Mercifully, perhaps, during the
recent hanging crisis, few, if any,
Malaysians noted that Australian par-
liamentarians saw fit to raise on the
adjournment a matter of internal
Malaysian import. If they had, they
would be finding it doubly ironic that
at this difficult time not a single Aus-
tralian political voice was raised to
give even the slightest degree of sup-
port.
THE PRESIDENCY
GRINDING TO A VOTE
THREE WEEKS OLD, with slightly
, . . . ’ . . ° /
more ,ha ." s “. 7 eeks to .«»’ ‘ h <= Amen-
can campaign has been a
disappointment. The two major cand-
dates have do f l ° th ™
issues or even to show what manner of
f k resldent ™ght make. Mr. Nixon,
the Re P ubhca ” candidate, is zealous y
Preserving a statesmanlike mien, while
r - Humphrey, the Democratic Vice-
President, keeps trying to tease “the old
Nixon” out into the open. Mr. Nixon,
however, has declined even to engage in
television debates with the Vice-Presi-
dent, who needs some dramatic or
felicitous event to revive his campaign.
Seen from any point of view public-
opinion polls, financial contributions,
political organisation, or popular
enthusiasm, it is lagging very badly.
Eager as Mr. Nixon has been to keep
to the middle of the road, he has
seemed, however, to make a perceptible
turn to the right. In North Carolina he
told an audience that he disagreed with
the Federal policy of withholding funds
from school systems which delayed
racial integration in the classroom. This
view, tailor-made for the white south,
has since been expanded and is alien-
ating many liberal Republicans. Mr.
Edward Brooke, the Negro Senator
from Massachusetts, who has recently
supported Mr. Nixon, is said to be up-
set; it was Mr. Brooke who persuaded
the Republican candidate to talk of
“order with justice” rather than “law
and order,” which has an anti-Negro
connotation. Yet, Mr. Nixon seems to
calculate that he can win without the
Negro vote and that a frank bid for the
support of the poor whites, who will
otherwise succumb to the racist appeal
of the third candidate, Mr. George
Wallace, may be politically rewarding.
Poor Mr. Humphrey is doing his best
to throw off the odor of failure but it
is awfully pervasive and his best is
sometimes not very good. Many Demo-
crats, desperately trying to persuade
themselves to vote for Mr. Humphrey,
will have been thrown into gloom by
his curious remarks about troops being
able to be brought home soon from
Vietnam. They were worried when Mr.
Humphrey repeated his blunder, even
after President Johnson had swiftly, and
perhaps cruelly, contradicted him; such
vacillations tend to undercut all of Mr.
Humphrey’s efforts to speak with a
clear and liberal voice. Mr. Humph-
rey’s hasty trips around the country
have seemed ill-planned; however, Mr.
Lawrence O’Brien, political mastermind
for the Kennedys, is now on the job
as head of the Democratic National
Committee, and the Vice-Presidential
candidate, Senator Muskie of Maine, is
proving a lively and attractive cam-
paigner.
The polls were merciless to the Vice-
President last week—one survey show-
ing him running third in electoral votes
to Mr. Wallace. And even the tradit-
ional support of the trade-union mem-
bers will not be present in its usual
strength; the union leaders have en-
dorsed Mr. Humphrey but many of
the workers have found Mr. Wallace
saying what they themselves believe.
If anybody can rally Democrats to Mr.
Humphrey’s side, it may be the Republi-
can Vice-Presidential candidate, Mr.
Spiro- Agnew. His inept performance
culminated two weeks ago with the
absurd statement that Mr. Humphrey
was “soft on Communism.” Mr. Agnew
took it back, but not 'before the public
had been reminded that, if Mr. Nixon
wins, a man whose political experience
consists of a year and a half as Gover-
nor of Maryland will be, as the saying
goes, a heartbeat away from the
Presidency.
CRICKET
INSIDE THE MCC MIND
ALTHOUGH there was widespread
disgust at Prime Minister John Vorster’s
statement that an England team in-
cluding colored Basil D’Oliveira would
not be welcome in South Africa, some
of the anger has washed over on to the
MCC Committee. The heart of the mat-
ter lies not in the mental processes of
the MCC selectors, inscrutable at the
best of times, but in the role in which
the MCC Committee sees itself. Unless
this is understood, the profound differ-
ences which divide the committee from
its critics, both inside and outside the
MCC, are meaningless.
The MCC is a private club. The 23
members of its committee are the sort
of men you would expect to find on the
committee of any of a dozen or so other
London clubs. Their average age is 60.
Besides a former Prime Minister, they
include a general, a marshal of the
Royal Air Force, a former member of
the royal household, a Lord Lieutenant
of Kent, and an ex-deputy-chairman of
the Stock Exchange, six company chair-
men, and a number of distinguished Test
and county cricketers. As in other clubs,
contested elections are few.
The MCC is also the hub of the
international game and its predisposi-


Gubby Allen of the MCC Committee
...still in a state of shock
tion is to place the welfare of cricket
above all else. The critics’ argument
that the MGC Committee should use
its power in the cricketing world as a
weapon against apartheid in sport there-
fore made little impression on its mem-
bers.
As one of, them says: “The MCC has
always felt that it was its duty to try
to maintain the fixture. We believe
that more good comes from playing
cricket against people than from cutting
yourself off altogether. We’ve got to
state that unequivocally, otherwise
everything that has happened is unin-
telligible.”
In the eyes of the MCC Committee,
the problem it faced in the spring of
this year was how to pursue this objec-
tive in the face of the South Africa
Cricket Association’s craven refusal to
commit itself. The MCC decided not
to force the South Africans into a
corner. By allowing the situation to
remain fluid, it gave the South Africans
the chance of making a satisfactory
decision at a time when it was politic-
ally easiest for them to do so.
When the selectors met last month
they were aware that they were free to
choose D’Oliveira. They were also
aware that no assurance that he would
be admitted had ever been given by the
South Africans.
The best-informed speculation as to
what happened during that unprece-
dented six-hour-long meeting is mostly
based not on knowledge but on extra-
polation from the known attitudes of
those taking part. Gubby Allen, an
influential emeritus figure in the MCC,
six times president, now treasurer,
went into the meeting with the opinion
that D’Oliveira would be a bad choice
for cricketing reasons, but assuming
that there would be a majority in
favor of him. He is reliably reported
to have been astonished that this was
not so. Cowdrey, the captain, almost
certainly went into the meeting in favor
of D’Oliveira. He had fought for him,
against considerable opposition from the
other selectors, as a choice for the fifth
Test against the Australians. It is a
reasonable assumption that Kenyon,
a Worcestershire man, would also favor
D’Oliveira. Beyond this, it is pure
guesswork. It is said that Gilligan (the
president), his relation by marriage,
May, and Bedser, and Les Ames (the
tour manager) were against D’Oliveira,
Insole in favor, making it five-three
against. Others have Insole with the
antis and six-two at the finish. Different
versions may be had from, different
oracles or by studying the flight of birds
over St. John’s Wood.
What is certain is that the MCC
Committee was staggered at the outcry
with which the selectors’ original
decision not to include D’Oliveria was
received and has remained in a state
of shock ever since.
They met the following day with
newspaper reaction burning their ears.
And when the Rev. David Sheppard
and his friends went down to Lord’s
two weeks ago for an informal dis-
cussion of procedure for their protest,
they were amazed to find the full com-
mittee assembled yet again.
At the end of an unscheduled 90-
minute debate on the substance of the
issue, each side remained baffled by
the other’s point of view, a fact which
perhaps reflects the generation gap at
least as much as differing moral
assumptions. The selectors’ second
thoughts on D’Oliveira last week and
Mr. Vorster’s unattractive comments on
the matter seem only to have increased
the critics’ wrath.
TONGA
THE EXPLORER KING
WILL His Majesty King Taufa’ahau
Tupou IV of Tonga become the Pacific
equivalent of an oil-rich sheik of
Arabia? It’s a question that is being
asked half-humorously around the
South Pacific these days, ever since
the king saw for himself oil slicks
appearing on the water off one of the
200 islands that comprise his kingdom.
Does Tonga have oil or not? There
is no answer to that question yet.
Meanwhile the King is not letting the
oil seep under his feet. He is pursuing
an active line of investigation, and in
the process is becoming pursued him-
self. Two Australian companies, with-
out even setting foot in Tonga, have
approached the Government there seek-
ing some kind of exploration lease,
merely on the basis of the slender
report of a few oil slicks.
The oil slicks were observed 30 years
ago by a young Tongan nobleman,
Koloamatangi, but no attention was
paid to them. Koloamatangi saw them
again recently, and when the King
visited the island last month he was
shown them. Being on the lookout for
anything that will benefit Tonga
economically, the King ordered an im-
mediate geological investigation.
The tiny island upon which Tonga’s
new hopes rest is called Eua. It
measures only 34 square miles and lies
about 12 miles off the south-east coast
of the main island of Tongatapu. It
is well populated and fertile, being the
source of most of the timber used in the
kingdom. The oil slicks, which are
small and frequent (about one every
four minutes), are appearing in the
harbor of Ohonua in water that is only
2ft. deep at low tide.
At the King’s request, Fiji sent its
Director of Geological Surveys, J. C.
Grover, to make an initial investigation.
Mr. Grover, who has the enthusiasm
for his job that lies under the top
crust of most geologists, is excited. But
it’s not the oil slicks themselves that
excite him. “It’s the geology of the
place,” he says. Grover explains that
the limestone there is positively indenti-
fiable as being eocene age, the type of
limestone which is found in commer-
cial oil-producing areas. He says he
believes that if there are any oil-
bearing structures there, they go back
about 180 miles north into Tongatapu
itself, dipping down into a basin about
70 miles to the north-west, and that
they probably become very much
thicker the farther they go. For that
reason, he thinks that any exploratory
drilling will be on the mainland rather
than where the slicks have been sighted.
The Tongan people themselves,
appropriate inhabitants of a country
alternatively titled The Friendly
Islands, are joyful. The King has spared
no effort in keeping his subjects in-
formed on progress. But they have no
illusions and their realism is. spiked with
humor. A Tongan lawyer, asked what
he thought of the oil prospect, said:
“The prospect of sudden riches from
oil is staggering. It’s almost silly to
think about it, but could you imagine
the world tomorrow with money-rich
Pacific Islanders providing aid and
technical advice for the development
of the poor European nations?”
NEW ZEALAND
BUCKING THE CONFERENCE
PRESSURE is building up for greater
New Zealand control over the shipping
services on which she is so dependent
for carrying her primary exports.
Freight rates for refrigerated cargo and
wool are to rise again. Meat Board
Chairman Sir John Ormond knocked
the British conference lines down from
an over 10 percent increase to a 3.67
percent increase, but European lines
imposed an 8.5 percent increase.
The annual freight hike ritual re-
opens longstanding objections to the
ransoming power of the conference
lines. This year more intense feelings
have led to growing interest in what
Sir John Ormond calls a maritime
policy for New Zealand and the Labor
Party and Seaman’s Union call the need
for a national shipping line. The sea-


men, who have worked hard on Labor,
have publicised their cause relentlessly
even free matchboxes proclaim that
New Zealand pays foreign shipowners
S2OO million annually.
Because New Zealand has no national
line of its own, Sir John, who is also
Chairman of the Exports and Shipping
Council, recently declared that New
Zealand should consider either national-
line chartering ships, or buying into the
conference lines. The Council has con-
vened a conference for December 6 to
consider the maritime policy prospects.
P and O Line Chairman Sir Donald
Anderson and Australian National Line
Chairman Sir John Williams will
speak.
The conference lines have said New
Zealand may buy into their conference,
but have not said at what cost. One
attraction to join is access to the operat-
ing information which British legisla-
tion has so far kept secret from
would-be defenders of New Zealand’s
economic interests. The Australian line
is often cited as an example of what
New Zealand should do. Interest is not
as great among the national-line pro-
ponents in investing in ships for the
British run, which is a declining mar-
ket, as it is for an Asian line able to
open up new markets. The nationalist
content in the clamor has not yet
accommodated ASEAN (Association of
South-East Asian Nations) interest in
a regional line which Thailand’s
Foreign Minister Thanant Khoman
feels New Zealand could participate in.
The N.Z. Government has been
opposed to a national line, but recent
statements from the Minister of Labor,
Mr. T. P. Shand, indicated changes in
Government thinking. The latest indi-
cation is that the Government wants to
buy into the conference lines to forestall
Labor’s national line, which may still
prove too expensive an investment.
COOK ISLAND
SOUTH PACIFIC BLOW-UP
COOK ISLAND Premier Albert Henry
has caused consternation in New
Zealand Government circles with his
interest in an American syndicate’s
offer to invest $64 million in the
island’s tourist future. The syndicate,
believed to include Pan American,
wants to lease the beautiful island of
Aitutaki (population 2000) for 21
years.
The threat to Air New Zealand, which
had been granted sole landing rights
in the group in return for a $N.Z.6.7
million investment in an international
airport on Rarotonga, will lead to a
bitter dispute in Wellington this week
between Premier Henry and the Gov-
ernment, which provides 75 percent of
his annual Budget.
New Zealand can stop the project,
as she has control over the external
affairs of the group’s 20,000 people
who retain New Zealand citizenship,
despite having gained internal self-
government in 1965.
Salazar...36 years of economic
stagnation
PORTUGAL
AFTER SALAZAR?
LAST MONTH, before the world
learnt about Dr. Salazar’s illness, the
79-year-old ruler of Portugal since 1932
made some new appointments to key
posts which, in retrospect, suggest that
he wanted to avert the prospect of an
immediate struggle for power among
his successors. He dismissed the over-
powerful Minister of the Interior, Mr.
Alfredo dos Santos, and put a new man
with no political experience in charge
of this Ministry and of the formidable
Pide, the political police. He similarly
brought in little known personalities
to head six other Ministries, including
those of the Army and Navy, which,
as usual in Salazarist Portugal, were
again entrusted to officers in the respec-
tive services. Only one dynamic charac-
ter figured among the new promotions:
the new Chief of Staff of the Armed
Forces, General Venancio Deslandes, a
tough Air Force officer who com-
manded the forces in Angola after the
first outbreak of fighting there in 1961
and then fell foul of a Minister for
Overseas Territories who later lost
favor himself.
In this context, the appointment of
General Deslandes could indicate Dr.
Salazar’s recognition that the armed
forces, which installed him in power
so many years ago, must, in any case,
have a decisive say in the formation of
a successor regime. Physically, the ser-
vices now loom larger than ever before
over the Portuguese scene. Before the
Angola war began, the Army was only
30,000 strong; now there are 140,000
troops in Africa alone, many conscripts
must serve for four years, and the bill
for the African campaigns swallows up
almost half of the national budget.
But the political record of the Portm
guese military is one of ineptitude.
After overthrowing the weakling
republic of the 19205, they discovered
that they had no idea how to run the
country. They called in Dr. Salazar
as a technician, and soon found him
their master. When the old man’s im-
perial visions landed them with the
prospects of unending war, such symp-
toms of restiveness as they showed were
easily squashed. A few weeks after the
first outbreaks in Angola, the defence
minister and a group of other generals
demanded that Dr. Salazar should
surrender power to a military junta;
within 24 hours they themselves had
surrendered and been dismissed.
Even before Dr. Salazar was struck
down by illness, reports had circulated
that a number of young officers in An-
gola, as well as some civilian whites
there, were thinking of a “unilateral
declaration of independence” but not
a Rhodesian Smith-type one. Exasper-
ated by the interminable conflict in
Angola as well as by the political and
economic stagnation in Portugal, they
seem to have thought of doing a deal
with at least some of the leaders of
African resistance, proclaiming an in-
dependent Angola in which whites and
blacks would share power, and thereby
speeding the process of change in Por-
tugal itself to which most of these
officers would in due course hope to
return, rather than settle in Africa for
good. Thoughts of this kind may well
have been encouraged by the news from
Lisbon that the long Salazar era was at
last reaching its end.
The regime has in recent years shown
no sign of adaptations to changing
conditions. On the contrary, its severe
rigidity has been reinforced, the screws
steadily tightened. The Pide worked
its way systematically through all
the opposition groups, whether Liberal,
Socialist, Communist, or Catholic, and
left them all in disarray. The Bishop of
Oporto was forced into exile after pro-
testing at the cruel treatment of politi-
cal prisoners. (Portugal’s cardinal-
archbishop made no such protests; his
friendship with Dr. Salazar since boy-
hood is held to explain much of the
passivity of the country’s Catholic
hierarchy.)
The open ferment that the past few
years have seen in neighboring Spain
is often contrasted with the relative
quiet in Portugal. Apart from national
temperament, one obvious difference
between the two countries is that
Portugal’s only frontier is the one with
Spain and the Spanish police have
often been known to assist the Pide by
detaining Portuguese dissidents who had
either escaped from their own country
or were trying to enter it secretly. Its
relative geographical isolation has also
tended to shield Portugal from the in-
fection of change in a Europe in which
it is now the poorest country, in terms
of income per head, with the one pos-
sible exception of Albania. Yet, in 1966
alone, 120,000 of the nine million
Portuguese emigrated legally to Euro-
pean or American countries, while
others went to Africa and a further
substantial number left the country
illegally. Last year strong steps were
taken to curb this flight from poverty
and hopelessness. Dr. Salazar’s insis-
tence on balanced budgets and massive
foreign exchange reserves has come to
hold back economic growth disastrously.
Even among the big businessmen, who
backed his regime with enthusiasm and
profit for so many years, hopes of
change have begun to emerge.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
LAST DESPERATE THROW
PRESIDENT JOHNSON has long
been considering a summit meeting with
the Soviet leaders. “Like a gambler
who dreams of wiping out all his losses
at a single throw, the President keeps
hoping for a lucky turn that will end
the war, justify his policies, confound
his enemies, and carry him triumph-
antly into retirement,” commented
James Reston in the “New York
Times.” “In this year of astonishing
political surprises, nothing can be
ruled out. The yearning for peace in
the country is very strong. The fear of
defeat in the Democratic Party is even
stronger, and a sudden summit meeting
in October would be a new element in
the campaign, which would be hard to
calculate. No doubt, the whole thing
would be denounced as a fraud—Mr.
Johnson’s last political manoeuvre to
President Johnson and Secretary of State
Dean Rusk with something on their
minds
rescue Humphrey from defeat—but who
can tell? The President was on the verge
of announcing a summit meeting on the
eve of the Soviet invasion of Prague,
and he keeps coming back to the subject
even now.”
Although his top advisers oppose a
summit meeting now, because of
Russian moves in Czechoslovakia and
threats against West Germany, President
Johnson wants it for reasons of self-
justification. He thinks he has been right
about the Vietnam War, right about
the cities, right about the race question,
and cruelly treated and misjudged by
the Press, the allies, and even by old
friends in his own Party. “Lyndon
Johnson is a poker player,” says Reston.
“It is hard to believe he would make
such a dramatic gesture for political
reasons alone. But to justify his record,
to pull out of the game at the end of
the last quarter, he might risk a good
deal.”
The President has also been con-
templating a meeting of the Vietnam
allies in the period before the
Presidential election. He is now think-
ing that after New Zealand Prime
Minister Keith Holyoake visits him on
October 9 and 10 he might take Mr.
Holyoake with him to some Asian city
where they would meet the leaders
of Australia, South Korea, Thailand,
and the Philippines to confer on the
course of the Paris peace negotiations.
By this means he would hope to
emphasise his long-range foreign policy
goal of building regional groupings
that would share with the U.S. the
burden of preserving peace in the
world — and to give the Democratic
presidential candidate some campaign
help by holding such a high-level con-
ference just before the election.
TO A MOSCOW SUMMIT
MEANWHILE Republican Presiden-
tial aspirant Richard Nixon is plan-
ning his own summit. He indicated
that one of his first acts in the White
House would be to seek a meeting
with Soviet leaders to negotiate joint
problems. Toward that end Nixon has
dispatched a campaign aide, former
Pennsylvania Governor William Scran-
ton, to Europe to determine the attitude
of leading Western leaders toward such
bilateral discussions. Scranton’s first
appointment was with President De
Gaulle in Paris. Ever since his accep-
tance speech at the Republican con-
vention in Miami Beach, Nixon has
talked of the necessity for a meeting
with the Russians, characterising the
coming era in diplomacy as a period
of “negotiation and conciliation” in
contrast to the period of “confronta-
tion” which he maintains is vanishing.
At the same time, Nixon continues
to believe in a firm attitude toward the
Soviet Union. He favors increased
efforts to improve America’s nuclear
capacity and suspension of aid and
credits to nations supplying North
Vietnam with strategic materials.
“The Russians seek something dif-
ferent in the world than we do,” he
stated in a campaign speech in Los
Angeles. “They seek expansion. We
seek peace. I believe that in negotiat-
ing with the Russians we must start
with a policy of strength and firmness
that they respect. That is not a bellig-
erent position, but it is one the Soviets
will understand. That is why in a series
of summit meetings I believe we can
find those areas where we can agree.”
TOO MUCH PEACE
SINCE the U.S. ceased bombing most
of North Vietnam on March 31, the
population has increasingly felt that the
war was all but over, according to
intelligence reports sent to Washing-
ton. The people were never told that
North Vietnamese troops were fighting
in the South and the only part of the
war that touched them personally was
the devastation wrought by American
bombing.
According to the reports, North Viet-
nam has now been almost completely
rebuilt north of the nineteenth parallel.
The country’s sole steel plant, once
destroyed, has been put back in opera-
tion, and over 75 percent of its dams,
which had been out of commission, are
operating again. Bridges have been put
back in use in many parts and roads
improved with modern black-top sur-
faces. Two major railway arteries to
China have been re-opened in perman-
ent beds and given a third rail so that
standard-gauge trains from China can
now run on Vietnam’s metric-gauge
system. Haiphong harbor has been
dredged and is handling 30 major
ships weekly. Other rivers have been
dredged. Large barges are plying the
inland waterways.
North Vietnam has improved so
much domestically that those living in
areas off limits to TJ.S. bombers are
now beginning to lapse into a “business
as usual” mood. The Hanoi regime is
said to be worrying that a “peace is
here” feeling might lead to demands
for relaxation of rationing and an end
to the military draft, which was for
“defence against invasion.”
THE REBELLIOUS 51
BEHIND THE disciplining of dissident
priests in the Washington area by
Patrick Cardinal O’BoyTe lay a serious
challenge to the Catholic Church by a
growing number of the young clergy
throughout the country.
When Pope Paul VI issued his July
29 encyclical reaffirming opposition to
artificial birth control, 51 priests in the
area of the national capital answered
with their own “statement of con-
science” rejecting the encyclical and
asserting the right of spouses to decide
whether or not to resort to artificial
contraception. Cardinal O’Boyle has now
taken disciplinary action against the
Washington priests, suspending them
from one or more clerical functions,
including hearing confessions and say-
ing mass in public.
To the Cardinal, who believes in
implicit obedience to ecclesiastical
authority, the rebellious behaviour of
the 51 priests proved that the wide-
spread distrust of authority pervading
American society had begun to corrupt
the Catholic Church as well. To the
priests involved, as well as to many
young priests elsewhere in the United
States, the fundamental issue was far
more complex. Many questioned
whether Vatican II was not already
out of date.
In the three years since the end
of the Ecumenical Council, younger
priests and laymen have begun to
challenge at least three assumptions
that Vatican II regarded as sacrosanct.
First, they have come to believe that
priests and laymen have a role not only
in Church government but in defining
Church teachings and that the Pope
and bishops cannot speak with authority'

apart from the will of the Church as
a whole. “Priests are coming to be-
lieve that their powers, like those of
bishops, are not merely delegated but
that they have certain powers by virtue
of their own office,” explained Rev.
John Whalen, acting Rector of Catholic
University in Washington.
Second, young priests no longer
accept a ruling because it is spoken by
higher authority. “Now an internal
logic has to be present as well,” Father
Whalen said, “and assent is given only
to something that makes sense to you.”
Third and most significant, younger
priests are challenging the Church’s
claim to possess absolute truth. “The
modern physicist talks about probability
rather than certainty,” said a theologian
at Catholic University. “Likewise, as
a theologian I cannot describe any
theological definition as universal in
any sense.”
ACUTE HEART SHORTAGE
THE SUDDEN increase in heart and
kidney transplants throughout the
world has led to a shortage of suitable
organs for transplantation and this
shortage will become acute in the near
future, experts agreed at the annual
meeting of the International Congress
of the Transplantation Society held
in New York. In heart transplants, it
was estimated that potential needs
would require use as donors of every
third adult who died of causes other
than heart disease and cancer.
Dr. Theodore Russell, director of
the U.S. National Heart Institute, sug-
gested three possible solutions to the
supply problem: more donations and
better storage of organs; use of parts
from animals; test-tube fabrication of
tissues and organs from living cells.
Progress was actually being made on
all three fronts, Dr. Russell said.
At this stage of transplantation
techniques, the central problem was the
process of rejection in which the
recipient’s body tends to attack and
destroy the transplanted organ because
it is foreign. Immuno-suppressive
drugs such as azathioprine, prednisone,
and an experimental biological sub-
stance called anti-lymphocyte globulin
were effective to some degree in pre-
venting rejection, but often left the
patient prey to infections. Dr. Russell
estimated that 85 percent of deaths
following transplantations were due to
infections.
Sir Peter B. Medawar, British Nobel
Prize winner and pioneer in transplan-
tation biology, delivered an optimistic
final report to the meeting. He noted
that there had been much progress in
ways unpredictable a few years ago.
Unpredictable problems undoubtedly
lay ahead, but transplantation of
organs certainly would be assimilated
into ordinary clinical practice despite
them. “There is no need to be philoso-
phical about it,” he commented. “This
will come about for the single and
sufficient reason that people are so
constituted that they would rather be
alive than dead.”


Where is ODHNER different
from other
adding
machines?
Where?
Firstly let’s tell you why
The Aktiebolaget Original Odhner Company
in Sweden has a concept of adding machine
manufacture which differs from its com-
petitors. Unlike other manufacturers who
locate their factories in the large industrial
cities, Odhner establishes production plants
in the smaller and less populated areas where
usually the whole working population make
up the work force of the Odhner organization.
Nearly every family, generation after gener-
ation, provides the skilled artisans and crafts-
men required for the efficient manufacture of
the Odhner range of precision-engineered
adding machines. Men with a heritage of
highly specialized skills, dedicated to the task
— as their fathers were — of producing, in
the best Odhner tradition, machines of un-
erring accuracy and unfailing reliability for
export to over 100 different countries through-
out the world.
That’s WHY Odhner is different.
But accuracy and reliability alone have not
made Odhner a world sales leader. Many
prefer Odhner’s compact keyboard which is
so easy to learn and so simple to operate.
Compare the design of the Odhner keyboard
with other 10-key machines and see the differ-
ence. Feel the easy cushion-depression action
of the adding keys and functional motor bars,
positioned just right for fast, effortless, silent
operation.
When figures print out on the Odhner tape,
you don’t have to ‘squint’ to read them —
they come through bold and clear. Subtract
items, credit sub-totals and totals print in red
. . . There’s a wide range to choose from too
— machines with tabulating carriages and
models that MULTIPLY WITH PRINTED AN-
SWERS. And we haven’t said a word about
Swedish steel.
That’s WHERE Odhner is different.

The Sabah tug-of-war
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
A LITTLE over a month after Malaysia
and the Philippines agreed to a
“cooling-off period” over Sabah, our
two neighbors are nearer to breaking
relations than on any recent occasion.
“The Republic of the Philippines has
acquired dominion and sovereignty
over Sabah,” says Senate Bill 954, signed
by President Marcos on September 18.
“A violation of Malaysian sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and, as such,
a highly provocative act tantamount to
aggression,” said Prime Minister Tunku
Abdul Rahman the same day. “We are
neutral,” says Australia, faithfully
reflecting a general Western Powers
attitude which can best be categorised
as see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-
evil—after all, the wicked Comms aren’t
in on the act, are they?
In short, despite all the years of
asserting that Australia is part of the
region, the Sabah dispute now well
illustrates that there is still no intra-
regional policy.
But first, what has happened during
the so-called cooling-off agreed to at
the meeting of the Association of South-
East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in
Djakarta?
Neither the Bangkok talks nor the
Razak-Ramos agreement at the ASEAN
meeting did anything to get Malaysia-
Philippines relations out of the impasse
in which any formula which casts doubt
on Sabah’s status is unacceptable to
the Malaysians, while any which solidi-
fies that status is equally unacceptable
to the current logic of Filipino politics.
At Bangkok the Malaysians rejected
the claim outright and at Djakarta all
that was promised was the exploration
of means of conciliation. Obviously,
from the Malaysian viewpoint, the only
conciliation likely to win their approval
was the dropping of the claim. In
Manila such a step, while objectively
necessary, was subjectively impossible,
or at least seen to be such. The day-
to-day need to conciliate the internal
political maelstrom saw to that. Presi-
dent Marcos might have stopped to con-
sider that he was ultimately faced with
the choice of carrying the Philippines’
legal claim to Sabah to its only logical
conclusion that of taking the State
or that part of it the Philippines
claimed by force or to damp down
the agitation before it got out of hand
and forced him toward the far more
painful choice, the surrender of the
claim. Perhaps he never saw it this
way. He has gone along with the claim.
This is scarcely surprising since those
who know the President do not rate his
grasp of international reality as one
of his strong points. Marcos tends to
see foreign affairs in terms of domestic
political advantage. If Marcos knew he
Philippines President Marcos and his Cabinet in session on the Sabah dispute
was going to kick the Sabah-claim foot-
ball around he should never have
allowed the Malaysians “in” to see the
match. It is doubtful if the President
ever thought that far ahead.
On the one hand, the President
leaves the Department of Foreign
Affairs too much alone, while on the
other, when Foreign Secretary Ramos
makes sensible moves he may well find
himself undercut by Malacanang (the
presidential palace). This is what
happened after the Djakarta meeting.
Ramos was never given any backing
for the way in which he responded to
the regional pressures for easing off
the dispute. One can argue, of course,
that the cooling-off agreement was noth-
ing more than international wishful
thinking by two moderately minded
men on an issue that allowed virtually
no room whatsoever for moderation, but
the real point is surely that neither
Marcos nor any other Filipino leader
hailed the agreement as a worthwhile
compromise.
Well, of course, ASEAN accord won’t
get anyone re-elected next year.
The best that came forth was an
(easily deniable) “informed Malacan-
ang sources” report indicating that the
Philippines “will continue to pursue the
claim to Sabah through normal diplo-
matic channels but at the same time
will undertake a cooling-off period.”
The old incompatibles. But while the
President was still trying to have his
political cake and eat it, at the United
Nations, Philippine Ambassador, Salva-
dor Lopez, reportedly likened the dis-
pute to that between India and Pakis-
tan over Kashmir.
Consistently over the years, but con-
spicuously over the past few months,
Sabah has been portrayed in the Philip-
pines as some El Dorado well worth
claiming for its spoils.
This was not the only report the
Malaysians found themselves denying.
Ironically, the very day after President
Marcos in mid-August said that leaders
of both countries were making deter-
mined efforts to resolve the dispute,
one of his own Cabinet Ministers
proved how wrong he was. Secretary
for Labor, Bias Ople, revealed that the
latest batch of Filipino workers return-
ing from Sabah feared “the outbreak
of war between Malaysia and the Philip-
pines is imminent.” Ople charged that
the “continued harassment of some
26,000 Filipino workers in Sabah,
together with the fast military build-
up in the area constitutes grave provo-
cation.”
Naturally, as the Malaysians rolled
out one more denial, there were not
lacking those who wondered if Ople’s
allegations were not indicative of
Malacanang making determined efforts
in other directions than those of
regional peace and harmony. Nonethe-
less the Malaysians largely contented
themselves at this stage with reiterat-
ing their rejection of the claim and
their hope that the Filipinos would see
their way to dropping it. There was, in
other words, no give in the Malaysian
position what was there to give?
The Filipino answer, as always, has
been Sabah.
Marcos could have refused to sign
the annexation Bill on the grounds of
its international implications but
it is a bit late in the day for him to
stand up against the Frankenstein that
the Sabah claim has become. Instead,
he has gone along with the Congres-
sional tide and there is no guarantee
that that tide will wash him back into
office next year.
For one thing, he leaves himself open
as President to the charge of having,
by signing, made an empty gesture
unless he is willing and able to demon-
strate that the Philippines has dominion
and sovereignty.
In this sense, and contrary to some
popular arguments (aired in Canberra
among other places), it would seem
that the Malaysians are victims of their
own moderation. It would have been
a risk, no doubt, but had they taken a
firmer line earlier and either broken off
relations or the anti-smuggling pact,
conceivably Marcos would have had an
inducement not to sign. But these pres-
sures by themselves would probably
have been insufficient and could easily
have backfired on the Malaysians. When


it comes to the applying of pressure,
the real failure would appear to be that
of the Western powers —the Americans,
the British, the Australians, and the
New Zealanders. If ever there was a
time for the private, sustained applica-
tion of pressure, it was at the beginning
of the cooling-off period if not earlier.
Marcos could have been told in no
uncertain terms that the Philippines’
long-standing friendship with his
SEATO allies depended on his elimin-
ating this ridiculous bone of regional
contention. This would have hardly
made things any easier for Marcos
domestically, in that he could scarcely
have given the pressure as the reason
for changing course. It could, however,
have been the correct stimulant for
making him want to behave like a
statesman instead of a hack politician.
But what does one find on the Ameri-
can side at this critical time but a new
Ambassador attempting to ingratiate
himself by riding caribou, wearing bar-
ongs, dancing the local dances any-
thing but taking the Filipinos seriously.
To be fair, as yet, there are still few
people or papers who will quibble at
this process. But the resentment is there
at these reminders of American paterna-
lism, and the point is that such a pro-
cess evidently robs Ambassador “Soapy”
Williams of the capacity to take serious
matters seriously.
Conversely have the Malaysians taken
the affair too seriously? Has Kuala
Lumpur over-reacted? Leaving aside
the fact that those who most frequently
make the argument may well be trying
to rationalise their own inaction or
may have what they regard as good
reason for hoping against hope that
the dispute will just go away, that the
Filipinos will somehow or other start
diverting themselves with a truly in-
ternal issue, the simple answer is surely
that it is their constituent State which
is being kicked around the Filipino
arena and which is now legally
annexed.
One can argue that all the nonsense
is largely a Filipino game to be under-
stood in largely Filipino terms, and
certainly it can safely be asserted that
the Malaysians generally are not strong
in their understanding of Filipino
political acrobatics. But where does this
lead? It surely would be an incredible
argument to suggest that we all have
to understand the Filipinos on their
terms without them having to do the
reverse, especially now that their in-
ternal politics have spilled over into
international relations? To query the
Malaysians’ choice of words in their
circumstances would appear irrelevant
since in international relations a legal
annexation is a legal annexation: and
when a Philippine Congressman asserts
that the Philippines can take Sabah in
72 hours it would seem completely out-
side the realm of the practical for the
Government so threatened to sit with
hands folded and say, “He’s only
joking.”
The new situation may be more tense
and more brittle, but again it would
surely be an extraordinary argument
that the Malaysians tolerate the claim
ad infinitum. Their interest, in contrast
to that of their as yet allies, is to wind
the whole matter up one way or another
well before 1971. It ill behoves any
Australian to argue that they should
“go slow” in relation to the Filipinos
when Australia itself is going very
slow in making post 1971 commitments.
To be sure the Malaysians might have
been more considerate of Filipino face
at Bangkok, but that they were con-
siderate is evidenced by the fact that
they went in the first place. (Others,
such as India, generally refuse to
negotiate claims on their sovereign
territory.)
When they discovered that in their
terms the Filipinos were not taking
themselves seriously enough the claim’s
rejection seemed the only logical step.
Those who criticise seem to forget that
Malaysia has to take herself seriously
too. After all, if the Indonesian Parlia-
ment for the sake of example one day
wakes up and decides that Queensland
falls within the realm of the Mad-
japahit Empire, and passes a bill to
that effect, would any government in
Canberra survive long if it sought to
take no notice?
To push the parallel further, the
Indonesians, in such imaginary circum-
stances, might be only bolstering their
ego —but would that make any differ-
ence? Would any Australian Govern-
ment happily allow them to bolster
their ego at our expense? In such
circumstances, what would Canberra
hypothetically be able to do? If it had
allies in the region, it could muster
them to Australia’s support; if it had
none, then “Fortress Australia” would
probably need a few more ramparts.
The utter bankruptcy of Australian
policy—presuming that “Fortress Aus-
tralia” is not yet the chosen ideal—was
well illustrated inadvertently by Philip-
pines Foreign Secretary Narciso Ramos
recently. The Tunku in Kuala Lumpur,
asked whether he expected the British,
Australians, and New Zealanders to
assist if the worst came to the worst,
replied with a clever double negative.
“They have not said that they will
not.” Over in Manila, Ramos retorted:
“The countries mentioned by the
Tunku are also our friends. We would
welcome the intervention of Australia
and New Zealand, not as allies of
Malaysia against us but as mutual
friends to help us solve the question
amicably and by peaceful means.”
On the surface, of course, a perfectly
reasonable statement, neatly playing up
to the fact that Australia is theoreti-
cally committed to both countries and
desirous of being friendly with both
neighbors. But what if there is no
meaningful compromise that interven-
tion can possibly hope to achieve?
Especially now that Sabah is by law, if
not by constitution, part of the Philip-
pines? Mr. Ramos is certainly playing
his cards well since, if his advice were
taken, Australia and New Zealand
might well end up not being regarded
as allies by Malaysia and very possibly
would cease to be mutual friends of
both countries.
Try as one might to see an alterna-
tive, the hard fact is that this dispute
is one of those occasions when either
you have to choose sides —or stay out
of it altogether.
It would seem, of course, that the
lack of any meaningful intra-regional
policy stems, in part, from Canberra’s
reactions still being those of the days
when the British were still here in full
force. Then, it was an advantage for
the British hard line to be supplemented
by an Australian soft one, as at the
time of confrontation. As of now, it
would seem more germane to recollect
that without the British being hard,
President Sukarno would probably
today be safely ensconced in the Istana
Negara, the official residence in Kuala
Lumpur.
Beyond this lies the need for calcula-
tion of hard interest. Is it really in
Australia’s long-term interest to be
neutral about quasi-historical legal
claims on others’ territory? Is it really
in Australia’s interest that the present
unproductive political frenzy in the
Philippines—of which the Sabah claim
is essentially an offshoot—should be
allowed to justify itself at the expense
of the one neighborly State which is
ordered, administered, and to some
extent developing. This is not to say
that there are any easy answers to these
questions. The point is that they should
be asked.
But one wonders if they are. Mean-
while, the dispute gathers momentum,
and the possibility looms that it will
have to be taken very much more seri-
ously—as a result of it not being taken
seriously enough. “We will fight to the
last drop of our blood,” said Malaysian
demonstrators in Kuala Lumpur last
week. “Our constitution renounces war
as an instrument of national policy,”
said President Marcos, forgetting to
mention that the self-same constitution
excludes Sabah from its delineation of
the Republic’s territory. “We are
irrevocably committed to the pacific
settlement of disputes,” said the Presi-
dent, neglecting to add that he, as never
before, is committed to the Sabah-claim
dispute and a few unpacific actions
might well make more electoral mile-
age for him.
Finally, incredibly, the President of
the Philippines claims that Senate Act
954 is essentially “a matter with the
domestic jurisdiction of the Philippines
Government” and that Malaysian
objections are in violation of the UN
Charter.
Even nationalist self-righteousness
must have its limits. Faced with such
travesties as this, one begins to rather
wish that the Philippines was capable
of launching a physical annexation in
order that it might be fully confronted
and in the process purged of the intro-
version, insularity, general corruption
and intellectual dishonesty that have
tragically become too much charac-
teristic of Philippines life and politics.


You ng and Married
By APRIL HERSEY
“I THOUGHT how marvellous it
would be to shower together.” Jackie
Weaver, not yet 21 but a bride of
almost two years, looked pensive. “But
he won’t. I thought of sharing every-
thing and talking all night. I had
always had a room to myself and no
sisters, and I imagined part of being
married would be the luxury of talking
the night away. But David is such an
individual. He functions so efficiently
by himself. He doesn’t need to talk to
me all night, so he goes off to sleep.”
The realities of marriage are rarely
thought about by the increasing
numbers of very young brides and
bridegrooms who go merrily up the
aisles of Australia’s' churches, non-
chalantly vowing to keep each other
in sickness and in health, and promis-
ing devotion until death with the same
ease that has governed all their actions
in the pop world of the ’fifties and
’sixties, almost the sum total of their
lives.
Last year more than 57,000 girls
aged between 16 and 21 were married.
About 44,000 boys in the same age
group promised to cherish and worship
and endow the girls with all their
worldly goods. Coping with the worldly
goods is probably the first snag that
strikes at the bliss of newlyweds.
Jackie Weaver, the tiny actress who
introduced herself to the show-business
world of Sydney at 15 when she walked
into a rehearsal of “Cinderella” wear-
ing her Hornsby High School uniform
and carried off the prize part and who
is currently in Shaw’s “You Never Can
Tell” at Sydney’s Old Tote, began her
marriage with David Price, tele-
vision producer and ex-Olympic skating
star, in a flat at Manly loaded down
with wedding presents.
“It was great fun,” she says. “Like
playing house. I loved cooking—l still
do—but there is always the washing-up
afterwards. And when you get the
house all pretty it all gets dirty again,
too.”
Jackie had been “going steady” with
Bryan Davies, the Prince to her original
Cinderella, for four years before she
met David Price. Two weeks after she
met the young producer, an Australian
by birth but rather more English than
the English after his television experi-
ence in London, he proposed to her.
“I thought how exciting,” Jackie
says. “What a marvellous thing to do,
getting married just like that. It
appealed to me, something different.
I thought how super." Five weeks
later, despite advice from many people
and wearing a mini-skirt and a feather
boa, she was married at the Wayside
Chapel.
“I think I’ve been through a crash
course in maturity since then,” Jackie
said. “I realise why my mother spent
the week before my wedding crying.
I’d never seen her cry before. She just
couldn’t tell me what I was doing, but
she was so certain that it wasn’t a good
idea. I love my husband, that hasn’t
changed, but I knew nothing at all
about him, really. He was much more
sophisticated, much more adult than
I. He was in his early twenties, though
most people thought we were both in
our late teens. We kept getting thrown
out of hotels for being under eighteen.
But David had been engaged before.
He had heaps of photographs of girls
he had known well. He was very
interested in racing-cars, still devotes
a lot of time to his Lotus Elan, and
he likes to train skaters who show
promise. He enjoys so many things I
really don’t know anything about. I
used to think it was important to follow
his interests, but I was just hanging
about. He didn’t need me there.”
Despite David’s gift of beautiful
hand-made skating boots, Jackie didn’t
take up skating. When they took a
house at Palm Beach for a year she
didn’t join him in the surf. “I’m just
not athletic.”
Looking back on her sudden leap into
marriage, Jackie now feels that a trial
marriage would have been a good idea,
“We pro bably would still have married
but much later and knowing what

on clothes. “But once I was married
I just went mad,” she says. “The bank
accounts went down and down. Now we
are getting a house at North Sydney
Jackie Weavers marriage—to David Price—has been “a crash course in maturity”


Chris Kennedy, 21, and Suzie, 20 ..."we don't want the hang-up of a family yet”
and furnishing it ourselves because we
must start saving.”
The worst feature of marriage to the
tiny actress has been her own two-stone
increase in weight. By dint of deter-
mined fasting she has now lost a stone
of it, but for a time she was spoiling
her career because of overweight. “It
was just boredom. I’d do the washing
and ironing and then finish up the
dessert from the night before. But I’m
getting better. The trouble with me is
that I don’t have ambition. I’m very
baby-conscious now, but I don’t think
that my marriage is at a stage where
it is a good basis for having a child.
Though, perhaps a baby would settle
us both down.”
To Robyn and Kim Hamilton (on
our cover), both aged 19 and proud
parents of Brodie Boi Hamilton, who
weighed in at BJlb. at Crown Street
Hospital on August 22, having a baby
is one of the exciting things about being
marned.
Kim was allowed to stay with his
wife throughout the delivery and re-
ported ecstatically: “What a tremendous
thing! I was a bit nervous that I might
get upset or something but it was
wonderful. I’ll make sure I don’t miss
any of the others. Robyn was gas, and
the baby’s gas, too.”
A photographer with Slatyer and
Rawlinson in Sydney, Kim has slightly
long hair, a wardrobe of brightly
colored shirts and suits, including one in
canary-yellow and one in green-and-
yellow tweed. A determined and very
sensible young man, Kim left school
at 15 because he wasn’t “a great scholar
or likely to finish up in one of the
professions where you need a long
education” and he felt he should try to
get a head start on his schoolmates.
His parents tried to persuade him to
take a five-year course in commercial
art at East Sydney Technical College,
but he left after three days. “I couldn’t
see myself living on my parents for
another five years. So I took a job as
a dark-room assistant and learnt every-
thing as quickly as I could.”
By the time he was 15-|- years old
he was earning $42 a week and courting
Robyn, a model who had originally
had a date with his older brother. An
only child, Robyn had fallen in love
with the whole Hamilton family, a
happy gregarious group of four boys
and one little girl.
Kim was working hard at learning
photography, starting at 8 a.m. and
often working through until 10 p.m.
“It was all fun to start, but eventually
any interest becomes work. Now I see
it as a means to an end. The best way
I know to get the things I want.” He
had taken on all the dark-room work
in a busy studio before he was 16.
“I’ve never worried about age. If I
can do it, then I can. What does it
matter how old I am?”
He continued to “go steady” with
Robyn, saving up for marriage through
four years. Meanwhile he paid off a
Honda sports car, bought himself a
used surfboard, took up water-skiing,
rode horses at Richmond, and generally
behaved like a teenage boy. “I could
always save money,” he says. “When
I first started working I spent only a
few dollars of my money each week
after paying board. I never knew
what other kids were spending it on.
I always banked about 75 percent of
mine.”
Marriage still seemed a long way off
when a serious accident in the Honda
ended Robyn’s modelling career. Skid-
ding on a wet road, the car went out
of control and Robyn was thrown
through the windscreen. Miraculously
she has hardly any scars to mark the
occasion. But photographic modelling
was no longer possible.
A long-term result of the accident
gave the young couple enough money
in insurance to pay a deposit on a
house. Months before this came through
the courts, they had decided to get
married. Wearing a dress she had made
herself, carrying a single gladiolus, and
a turquoise veil to match Kim’s tur-
quoise shirt under his snow white suit,
Robyn was married in a family cere-
mony surrounded by friends and
brothers-in-law.
“I had never had any idea about
money until I was married,” she said.
“But suddenly everything seemed to be
more purposeful. Two people can
really live cheaper than one. And
everything you spend seems to be part
of a plan once you’re married.”
“You can make plans, too,” Kim
said. “Not silly plans, like the things
you talk about before you’re married,
not everything rosy. Life is hard. You’re
fighting all the way to get somewhere.
But you know where you’re going.”
“You see, you can have a goal when
you’re married. That’s free. It doesn’t
cost anything. And it’s better if you
don’t make it too hard. This house we
have bought is only our first house. We
can afford this one,” Robyn said.
“And by the time we’ve had about
three houses we’ll be able to afford the
one we really want. We’ll build that
on real land with a bit of space round
it,” Kim said. “I’m glad I married
young. I’m so much further ahead
than other people. I’ll own a house
long before some of the people I’ve
worked for from time to time in the big
agencies. They amaze me that they
have nothing. And I’ve always wanted
to grow up with my children. By the
time I’m in my forties I’ll be free of
responsibilities again. That’s the time
to take a world trip. Our money will
be our own, and Rob and I will have
made our contribution to society, and
we can turn back to ourselves again.”
“By the time we have the swimming-
pool, the land, and the stables, maybe a
horse stud or something, we won’t want
to go overseas,” Robyn said.
To the Hamiltons, any talk of a


new morality means nothing. “People
who deliberately live together are just
kidding themselves,” Kim said. “It’s
just a big excuse to dodge responsibility.
I hate conforming to society, too, but
not getting around to marriage is like
not paying a bill. Marriage is more
important than long hair or any of the
other stuff you rebel about. It’s a
lifetime obligation, isn’t it?”
The $12,000 house the young couple
have brought in a distant suburb is
at the moment bare of everything but
enthusiasm. “We are furnishing it
practically for nothing.” Robyn, who
kept working almost until she had to
leave for the hospital, has been bar-
gaining hard with auctioneers for her
furniture. She has acquired a brass bed
for $lO, a refrigerator for $25, and has
swopped doors she doesn’t like for
louvred ones. She is making her cur-
tains from dyed calico which will later
be used as linings for the real fabrics,
and slip-covered old chairs in inexpen-
sive cottons.
Brodie Boi has arrived in the world
to a micro-wardrobe of bright mod
babywear and a gingham-covered
bassinet. “He won’t need much, any-
way,” say his parents. “He’ll be down
on the beach with us.”
Chris Kennedy (21) and his wife,
Suzie (20), live in a tiny terrace-house
in Newtown with Otis, their cat. Chris
is the son of Robert Kennedy, radio
commentator, and at the moment,
apart from studying economics at the
University at night, he holds down a
daytime job, plays in a band, and does
anything that comes to hand to prove
to his father that he can support a wife.
Suzie has just gained her science
degree and begun teaching so that the
family finances are being placed on a
very substantial footing. In six months’
time they plan to buy a house like the
one they are renting, do it up, and sell
it. Chris believes that there is a fortune
to be made in real estate around
Sydney if you don’t mind working.
When they took the cottage, the walls
were painted bilious blue and luminous
green. They had a painting party one
weekend and fixed that. Then Suzie’s
mother did some work for a fete and
had masses of blue material left over.
Suzie turned this into divan covers,
bedspreads, and curtains, They bought
all the furniture second-hand, apart
from stuff which their parents had
discarded. “Altogether we spent about
$lO to furnish the house,” Chris said.
“The only thing not working yet is the
television, and I’m getting around to
that.”
“We had a big wedding,” Suzie said.
“An evening one with all the guests in
long dresses and tails. And mother
made sure that I had the right presents
given to me. We found we had just
about everything possible to start
housekeeping.”
Housekeeping still has its ups and
downs for Suzie, who has mastered
cooking—“for two people, anyway”—
but sometimes finds that her living-
room is full of band equipment, her
dining-room covered in untidy sewing,
her bedroom full of strewn clothes, the
kitchen full of unwashed dishes, the
laundry full of ironing, and the bath-
room damp with towels. “One night of
the week I make a determined attack,
a real blitz!” she said.
With two years still to go before
he finishes his economics course, Chris
Kennedy is not too keen on an immedi-
ate family. Neither is Suzie. She looks
forward to doing scientific research
when her husband is fully qualified and
they have their own home. “I do want
children, but not yet. I’d rather get
everything settled first. And we want to
go overseas and see what’s doing. We
don t want the hang-up of a family.”
Last year Chris Kennedy helped to
save for his marriage by running a
series of dances, but this year his
Mrs. David Dixon, 21 ...a house, a housekeeper, and a well-planned future
studies are taking up more of his spare
time and he has had to give his entre-
preneuring away. He still plays with
his band a couple of nights a week
while Suzie marks science papers.
The two young people had known
each other for three years and had
known they wanted to be married for
two. “We just had to have enough
money and one degree,” Chris said.
“And we were both getting so tired
of travelling to see each other. Getting
married was one way to catch up on
rest. Besides, what’s the point of hang-
ing around unmarried? I can’t see
much in it. You don’t live for ever, so
you may as well be married.”
“Of course you are mad to marry if
you aren’t certain,” Suzie said. “I don’t
believe in living together. That’s so
mucky if there are children. People tell
you they are more free that way—
but they aren’t really. If a marriage
goes wrong you can still leave, anyway.”
“Getting married young is a good
idea if you want to get married,” Chris
said. “It’s as simple as that as far as
I can see. I just don’t see why it
matters what age you are really.”
In a more rarefied atmosphere, Mrs.
David Dixon (nee Sancha Bovill) is
just as young and inexperienced as the
other brides.
Married ten months ago at St.
Mark’s, Darling Point, before a crowd
of 450 people, Sancha (21) had the big
wedding she had always dreamed about.
“I didn’t miss out on anything,” she
said. “I wore white chantilly lace and
carried arum lilies, just as my mother
had done. And I was married on her
wedding anniversary.”
A slender girl, with her titian hair
pinned up, she seems older than her
flowing-haired contemporaries. Her new
two-storey house in Woollahra with its
walled garden and wide terraces had
none of the bravura of shoestring decor-
ating. The chairs were newly uphol-
stered in delicate brocades, the antique
furniture was polished to a fine lustre.
Somewhere in the background a house-
keeper was dealing with the kitchen.
“I’m terribly lucky to have Mrs. B,”
she said. “Though I love to cook
myself. I still do, of course, on her
night off.”
The new house took six months to
find after the sale of her husband’s
family home to Ascham School. This
older house, set in three-quarters of an
acre at Darling Point, was too dark
for Sancha. It was built 60 years ago
in the time when they wanted to keep
everything dark in case it faded, she

With new ‘SAXON’ by Stetson it’s the power to mark you as a man who
shuns conformity, thinks young whatever your years.
Most distinguishing among ‘SAXON’S’ many points of flattering dif-
ference is the impeccably stitched crown—decidedly audacious but
still in perfect taste. At all leading men’s stores.
explained. She felt she had to have
lightness about her. “More than any-
thing else I want to create a gracious
setting in my home,” she said. “I want
to make it quite perfect for my husband
and keep it that way.”
At the moment she is surrounded by
carpenters and painters, over whom she
wields a nervous power. “I keep getting
the impression that they are just
humoring me.” She is determined to
decorate the house herself. “I think
marriage is a full-time career. Right
from the beginning I want everything
about my house to reflect my own and
my husband’s ideas. I don’t want it to
be someone else’s plan for living.”
She is still taking the tags off the
plethora of wedding gifts she received.
“Oh, those thank-you notes! I thought
I’d never get to the end of them!”
As soon as the house is completed
she will begin having formal dinner
parties. “I love to have about 14 people
to dinner. At home we used to have as
many as 40, but I couldn’t manage
that here, though I adore big parties.
Actually, it’s economical in the long
run. If you have to have a steward in,
then you might as well have a lovely
big party.”
Life was very “average” for
Sancha. “I’ve always been average. I
went to Ascham at five and did the
usual things. I knew that I would prob-
ably meet someone when I was about
20 and get married when I was about
21. And I did. David is older — not
in my school-age group — and so he
was almost a stranger to me. Though
we had been brought up in the same
way. He inherited his family account-
ancy business early and he is an
accountant, too. I hope when I have
children that one of the sons will be
an accountant.
“David has a different nature from
mine. He is calm and I am volatile.
He understands money and whether
doors are plumb and things like thdt,
and he sometimes stops me if I want
to spend too much on an antique —
though mostly we like the same things
and it’s just heaven buying what we
want for the house. We’ve begun buying
our paintings. It must be very hard if
you don’t have money for the things
you need for your home. I think money
problems probably cause quarrels, and
I couldn’t bear that. David and I have
never had an argument and I hope we
never will.”
Sancha had no desire to have a
career apart from marriage. When the
house is complete she will work for
charities other than her present favorite,
the Peter Pan Committee. She has just
learnt to drive and moves out timidly
in her new Holden. Next year she will
probably travel, and then she hopes to
start her family.
“I don’t know how I’ll get on with
children,” she said. “I was the youngest
and I’ve never had anything to do with
them. I’d like to have three — two boys
and a girl — and then if I turn out to
be good at being a mother — perhaps
another girl. I must have a girl — I’m
already planning her wedding.”

COMMONWEALTH TRADING BANK OF AUSTRALIA
Deposits increased by $lOB million to a new high of $1,122 million at June, 1968.
Loans outstanding rose by $lO6 million to $667 million, providing support for general growth of the
economy.
A new service—lease financing—was introduced.
The number of accounts conducted passed the million mark. An increase of 36,000 accounts was recorded
over the year.
The Commonwealth Trading Bank is now represented at 1,105 branches and agencies.
The operations of the Bank’s International Division —providing services for the settlement of international
transactions and an information service for overseas traders —expanded during the year.
1967/68 profit after tax, $3,896,184.
COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS BANK OF AUSTRALIA
The highlight of 1967/68 was a record volume of lending for housing. New loans approved for housing
purposes during the year amounted to $l4B million, an increase of $l3 million over 1966/67. The Commonwealth
Savings Bank is the largest institutional lender for housing in Australia. Since 1946 it has lent over $1,200 million
for housing which represents assistance to nearly 250,000 families.
Loans totalling $57 million were also made available for essential community services such as roads,
electricity, water and sewerage.
Depositors’ balances increased by $l5l million. At 30 June 1968, depositors’ balances totalled $2,652 million.
The Bank conducted 6,822,000’ active accounts at 30 June 1968.
Commonwealth Savings Bank services are available at over 9,400 branches and agencies.
1967/68 profit, $6,778,693.
COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF AUSTRALIA
The Commonwealth Development Bank, which provides financial assistance to primary and secondary
industries for projects designed to increase production or productivity, does not compete with conventional and
traditional lenders, but provides help where, in the opinion of the Bank, such help is desirable and the finance
would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions.
The Commonwealth Development Bank experienced strong demand for term loans and equipment finance,
and $83.4 million was approved during 1967/68. Since its establishment in 1960 the Development Bank has
approved financial assistance totalling $577.8 million, and its activities play a significant part in the growth of the
national economy.
At 30 June 1968, balances outstanding totalled $227.5 million.

Over the border for
TO GET on side with Sir Robert
Menzies, Canberra’s National Capital
Development Commission hired British
consultants. Signing himself “Holford,
London,” Canberra’s chief patron dur-
ing the Menzies era was a prestigious
old man of British architecture and
town-planning and an important buttress
to Sir Robert’s faith in Canberra. It
was perhaps not surprising that when
Mr. Holt took over in 1966 the
Development Commission made moves
to dump Lord Holford and began look-
ing around for, yes, an American town-
planning prophet. In the event none
was found, and since Mr. Gorton isn’t
likely to be particularly impressed by
Holford, or an American equivalent, the
feeling in Canberra is that the days of
foreign oracles are nu'mbered.
But the future of Canberra is far
from clear. It does have competent and
imaginative town-planners, but they are
coming up against major obstacles. And
problems of the Government and
financing of Canberra are becoming
more acute. The city is now costing
Australian taxpayers about $7O million
a year, and that figure excludes the
money spent on obviously “national”
institutions like the Parliament, the
Govern’ment departments, the War
Memorial, and possibly “national” ones
like the Lake, etc. The figure grows
steadily year by year.
What is the overall policy for Can-
berra? No one these days seems pre-
pared to define it. Once it was policy
to concentrate at least the head offices
of Commonwealth departments and
instrumentalities in Canberra so that
the inevitable national bureaucracy
could grow in sensible proximity to its
political masters in Parliament, and
away fro'm the supposed parochialism
of a State capital-—-Melbourne. There
was also to be some national sym-
bolism as well as utility and economy
in a fairly rapid transfer of the Com-
monwealth Public Service into a new
national capital.
If that sort of policy hasn’t been
explicitly broken with, it has at least
been lost sight of lately, a fact which
was vividly brought home by this year’s
Public Service Board Report, just tabled
in Parliament. An appendix on “Trans-
fers of Departments to Canberra” shows
clearly that, on present plans, the Com-
monwealth is simply no longer tnaking
progress in shifting central office staffs
to Canberra. The number of positions
annually being shifted to Canberra has
been cut so low that it is now smaller
than the annual growth of positions in
departments still in Melbourne. The
Report outlines for the next three years
the smallest program of transfers to
Canberra since the policy was adopted
of getting departments out of their
cramped and crowded conditions in old
rented buildings in Melbouime. This
financial year 295 positions will be
transferred, next year 250, and in 1970-
71 only 150. Now, together with
defence personnel, the number of central
office positions still in Melbourne is
close to 10,000. The most optimistic
and cost-conscious Treasury official or
Public Service Board inspector wouldn’t
put the likely annual increase in the
bureaucracy at less than four percent,
so the 10,000 will probably spawn an
extra 400 positions each year. The pro-
posed progra’m of transfers of 295, 250,
and 150 in each of the next three years
therefore adds up to abandonment of
the policy of getting all of the central-
policy officials of the Commonwealth
out of Melbourne and into Canberra.
As far as I can find out this isn’t
a consciously determined policy.
Inquiries in the appropriate places
bring forth the usual platitudinous
assurances that all is the same as before
and also the familiar bureaucratic reluc-
tance to face the logic of facts. This is
just one example of a more general
lack of interest by the present Govern-
ment in where events are leading.
The Minister for the Interior, Mr.
Nixon, cannot be expected to give too
much time to Canberra and its future.
He looks after electoral affairs, and
has a redistribution this year. He now
has the Northern Territory, and he also
has his Party position as a possible
successor to Mr. McEwen to worry
about. But, in the absence of any vestige
By PETER SAMUEL
of self-government by the citizens of
the Capital Territory, he does have
responsibility for governing Canberra.
For four years there has been sporadic
discussion by officials of the Capital
Development Commission about where
Canberra should develop, a crucial
question for a city which aspires to plan
well. On January 13, 1967, the consult-
ing firm of Alan Vorhees and Associates
dispatched their report on a “General
Plan Concept for Metropolitan Can-
berra.” Developed in concert with the
Commission’s own planners, this recom-
mended that “metropolitan growth
should be directed into a limited num-
ber of corridors,” and specifically it
said that the only practicable form for
a workable, modern Canberra metrop-
olis was a Y-form. The stem of the
Y could be filled out during the next
ten or 15 years into the valleys south
of the present city, but, after that, urban
growth would have to move to the
north-west toward Yass, and then later
north-east toward Goulburn. The corri-
dor principle, Y-form plan was subject
to exhaustive and advanced analysis
on traffic engineering, town-planning,
and economic criteria. Computer simu-
lation techniques of the most modern
kind were applied to it in what is
recognised as some of the best work
on urban growth being undertaken
anywhere in the world. The arguments
for the general-plan concept were over-
whelming and were adopted by the
Commission in the middle of last year.
It became evident then that there was
one difficulty of a particularly sensitive
political nature.
The tips of the Y would inevitably
fall outside Capital Territory into
the State of New South Wales.
The local Press wrote about it. The
Capital Development Commission, in
public evidence before a Senate Com-
mittee in October, 1967, said bluntly
that the Commonwealth “should begin
immediate negotiations with N.S.W. to
acquire land” for Canberra’s expansion.
Otherwise, land speculation and dis-
orderly ribbon development would
begin and the future of the area would
be jeopardised. Nothing was done, how-
ever, and the issue has only been raised
again by the publication of an issue
of the journal “Architecture in Aus-
tralia,” devoted to Canberra’s plan-
ning, in which the Head of the Capital
Development Commission, Sir John
Overall, puts his stamp of official
approval on the Y-form concept: “By
weighing the relationships between
alternative shapes of the urban area, the
arrangement and size of main centres,,
and transport networks it was demon-
strated that the best form of growth
would be a series of new towns of about
100,000 to 120,000 forking in a
Y-shape.”
That this would mean moving into
N.S.W. was made evident to a wider
audience when the “Canberra Times”
front-paged a diagram of the Y-Plan
showing four Canberra “towns” over
the border. The Development Com-
mission is now in the process of pre-
paring a hurried submission to an
embarrassed Mr. Nixon, suggesting that
he start negotiations with the N.S.W.
Government.
Of course, there could hardly be a
worse time for any representative to go
forth in the unfamiliar role of asking
N.S.W. Premier Askin for something,
since the Commonwealth, by its policies
of financial squeeze on the States, has
him in an unusually angry mood. Most
likely, the issue will be postponed a
while, but it cannot be put off for very
long. Already advertisements are
appearing in Canberra papers offering
“homestead sites” across the border in
N.S.W., and land is changing hands at
ten times the rural valuation. It will not
be long before the site of future Can-
berra townships becomes blighted by
shacks and haphazard subdivision. And
if the worst comes to the worst and
Mr. Askin says bluntly that Canberra
must be contained within its present
boundaries, then three years of intense
planning work will be down the drain,
and the Development Commission will
have to start all over again.
This would be a terrible blow to


Canberra?
Canberra. It would force a sprawl into
expensive and unsuitable rough hill
country, which would wreck some of
the most attractive bushland within 50
miles. It would also increase greatly
the travel needs of the future
metropolis, making it more expensive to
service and run: the simulation work
by the consultant showed that only if
urban growth was directed into a
limited number of corridors would the
city be able to support an efficient low-
cost transport system, based on a spinal
fixed railway and peripheral freeways.
This was why Canberra planners
designed the shape of future towns so
that traffic generation within would
not be sufficient to require freeways.
Freeways were to run a distance outside
the built-up area, so as to keep the
noise and fumes of heavy motor traffic
away from people.
Their computer studies have shown
that the traditional “spine freeway” (as
adopted in Perth and Melbourne) which
goes straight through the middle of a
suburban unit, close by the central area,
where shopping and offices are concen-
trated, is not only ugly but plainly
inefficient as well. The combined
traffic flows of cars trying to get to the
town centre plus the cars wanting to
use the freeway for inter-town move-
ment produce unhandleable volumes of
traffic. The answer to this is that, as
long as employment in the town centre
is kept below 15,000, simple divided
roads without overpass structures are
sufficient to service internal traffic, and
freeways can be kept out entirely. The
corridor principle of stringing towns
along lineally also has the advantage
of minimising the number of elaborate
freeway interchanges the spaghetti-
like structures which so dominate the
townscape of places like Los Angeles—
and cost an enormous amount of money.
Perth is in the process of spending
$lO million on one such interchange.
But it is grossly misleading to des-
cribe the planning and administration
of Canberra as good, and leave it at
that. The government of Canberra
ranges from the outstandingly good to
the incredibly inept. For example,
the general idea of towns of 100,000,
each containing perhaps 15,000 work-
places and therefore a degree of self-
sufficiency, seems an excellent solution
to the sprawl problem and a good
compromise between the unrealism of
self-contained “new towns” and the
intense traffic congestion of the heavily
centralised metropolis, but faults are de-
veloping in the implementation of this
idea. The first large decentralised office
blocks are just coming into use in the
town of Woden, at the very time
that Government housing into which
transferees mostly move, is ceasing to
be built there. Most will be housed
in the fourth town, Belconnen. On
present indications, too, Belconnen
The National
Development
Council has
adopted a plan
for Canberra to
grow into a
series of new
towns of about
100,000 to
120,000 people,

workplaces will not be created in any
numbers until housing development is
placing new workers in the fifth town
of Tuggeranong.
The other difficulty in implementa-
tion comes with the resistance of de-
partmental heads to the decentralisa-
tion of their offices. For example, the
Development Commission has wanted
to limit the growth of the Russell Hill
defence complex on the north of the
Lake near the American War Memorial
and has planned further buildings in a
decentralised position toward Woden
or at Belconnen to provide short trips
to work for the people who would
be predominantly housed in these new
towns. But the adopted plan is evidently
for a second defence complex at Cam-
bell Park, just over the back of the
present Russell Hill group of build-
ings. Not only will this generate many
thousand seven- to ten-mile cross-city

that the whole of Australians defence
administration will be vulnerable to

As the Public Service grows, there are
going to be increasing numbers of
battles by departments that do not want
to be decentralised to the outer town
centres, and private business is under-
standably going to want to be near
the growth points as determined by the
departmental heads. It is going to need
very strong and persuasive leader-
ship by the Development Commission
to actually achieve the metropolitan
pattern it has blueprinted.
In the provision of basic city ser-
vices drains, sewers, water supplies,
and roads Canberra looks quite
extravagant to the visitor from Mel-
bourne or Sydney, familiar with his
vast areas of incomplete servicing. In
fact, it turns out on examination not
to be extravagance at all. The Devel-
opment Commission can turn up con-
vincing figures to show that Canberra
gets the full range of urban services for
not much more expenditure than the
outer areas of Sydney and Melbourne
get their partial, haphazard servicing.
In Canberra full advantage is taken
of modern earthmoving machines.
Land to be turned into a new suburb
is first trenched and all pipes inserted;
this done, all roads are built, and only
then is building commenced. There-
fore the biggest machines and plenty of
blasting with explosives can be used
to get the initial services in cheaply
and without interfering one with the
other. There is an absolute minimum
of digging up roads to insert pipes,
and then road repairs to fix up the
damage.
An even more effective way in which
Canberra manages to cheapen the cost
of urban services is through the policy
of concentrated development. Land is
sold on the basis that it must be built
on within a year; defaulting purchasers
have their land resumed. Thus suburbs
of Canberra are built up to 80 percent
of their final population within as short
a period as three years, whereas on the
outskirts of state capitals this may take
ten to 15 years. At any point of time,

therefore, in Canberra, expensive invest-
ment in roads and pipes is being used
at closer to design capacity. Urban
economist John Paterson, who is doing
an ambitious study of the pattern of
development in Melbourne, says that
under-utilisation of services is a major
factor in the high cost of suburban
development there. He thinks Can-
berra’s system of quick, concentrated
development brings major economies.
Canberrans sometimes complain
about the sacrifice this involves through
limiting the range of new homesites
available at any particular time, but
this seems a small price to pay for the
savings in rates and the better environ-
ment provided by a quickly built-up
suburb.
If the overall planning is very good,
much of Canberra’s administration is
correspondingly bad. Builders and
architects say that the application of
building regulations in Canberra is
worse than anywhere else in Australia;
so bad that one large building firm
and innumerable small operators have
been forced out. The architects’ asso-
ciation has been repeatedly asked to
document administrative abuses, but is
afraid of victimisation. In the name
of “ministerial discretion” the most
junior officials have the power to waive
regulations or interpret others accord-
ing to whim, the departments running
Canberra apparently having attracted
an unusual collection of embittered
authoritarian characters. The Capital
Territory’s laws are the oldest in Aus-
tralia, many being quite unamended
N.S.W. laws from the 19th century.
Though comprehensive law reform has
been promised for at least a decade,
evidence of movement is quite lacking.
The administration of the local hos-
pital has produced a series of scandals.
In most of these cases a problem is
the lack of any Canberra administra-
tion or government as such. Territory
law is the responsibility of the Com-
monwealth Attorney-General’s Depart-
ment, which understandably gives first
priority to the drafting of national
legislation. Similarly the running of
Canberra’s hospital services is a tiny
side responsibility for a Commonwealth
Department whose main task is to
administer quarantine laws and Com-
monwealth financial assistance to the
State’s health programs. Only the
Department of the Interior has a large
stake in Canberra, but the less said
about that department the better.
Canberra citizens seem remarkably
tolerant of bureaucratic rule, and
members of the impotent Advisory
Council are fearful of campaigning for
self-government because they believe
that there is a majority against it. This
is partly attributable to the nature of
the population half of them being on
the Commonwealth payroll and having
the public servant’s well-developed
ability to take orders, and accept abuse.
But it is probably more the feeling that
movement toward self-government

would cost them a lot more in rates
and taxes, or in reduced services.
This is largely illusion, sustained by
the lack of a Canberra Budget, which
would show the extent to which local
citizens are subsidised by the general
taxpayer. It is in fact quite simple to
draw up, a Canberra Budget by spend-
ing an hour on Treasury papers, and
making some simple allocations of joint
costs. Canberra’s current local needs
this year will cost $31,080,000 and
against that $19,620,000 revenue will
be raised locally, giving a deficit of
$11,460,000, about $lOO per head. Since
N.S.W. and Victoria are getting $74
per head in Commonwealth revenue
payments this year, Canberra does
better than them. But Western Aus-
tralia is getting $135. So Canberra is
somewhere in between.
Some of its charges undoubtedly
should be higher motor registration,
for instance, and water rates. And the
Commonwealth should get on and
impose its long-threatened stamp duty,
but if these measures were taken
Canberra citizens would be paying their
way at least as fully as the citizens of
the leanly treated States of N.S.W. and
Victoria.
There is therefore no financial argu-
ment against a substantial measure
of self-government for Canberra, al-
though the Commonwealth’s obvious
interests and responsibilities in Can-
berra in maintaining the Parliament,
the Public Service office buildings, the
diplomatic community, and clearly
national institutions like the National
Library, the Institute of Advanced
Sciences, the War Memorial, and the
like mean that self-government will
always have to be limited and some-
what hedged around.
A recent weekend seminar on the
government of the ACT, organised by
the local branch of the Liberal Party,
produced a consensus of expert views
in favor of movement. Professor Ruth
Atkins, a political scientist, said the
people of Canberra were lazy and
feeble in not pressing more strongly
for local government. A Canadian, Mr.
Donald Rowat, an international
authority on self-government systems
for federal capitals, said that the Com-
monwealth could be generous in grant-
ing a local council decision - making
powers simply because of the financial
leverage it would always possess. And
Professor Miller, of the ANU, has pro-
posed government of Canberra by an
elected Council with committees
specialising in Education, Health, and
Social Welfare, Finance, Works and
Services, and Lands and Industry.
The full parliamentary system as de-
veloped in the States and as evolving
in the Northern Territory certainly
seems unnecessary. For a time, at least,
the Council is certain to have to operate
under a Commonwealth Minister, with
the Territory being run as a local
government area of the Common-
wealth rather than devising its own
constitution as is likely in the


Northern Territory. But the entrenched
bureaucracy is strongly opposed to any
movement in the direction of self-
government. A very modest set of re-
quests by the currently impotent Ad-
visory Council for power to hold
its own inquiries, for the right to see
and comment on Territory ordinances
before they are enacted, and for rep-
resentation on committees inquiring
into A.C.T. matters was early this
year rejected wholesale by the Minister
on completely spurious grounds.
Now, by refusing to function in
forwarding recommendations to the
Minister, the Advisory Council has suc-
ceeded in forcing him to agree to a
committee of inquiry into self-
government. But the people of New
Guinea and the Northern Territory
have a long head-start on the people of
Canberra in devising a system whereby
they can have a say in the running of
their own affairs.
What will for a long time remain a
matter for Commonwealth Parliamen-
tary decision is the amount of money
being put into the expansion of Can-
berra. Fifty-six million dollars is this
year being spent on capital works,
which works out at $5OO per head of
the existing population. The States, in
loan funds, money for works and
housing, and authorised borrowings on
behalf of semi- and local-Government
authorities set between $lOO and $250
a head, or, averaged out between the
States, $l3O per head. So Canberra
is being treated extraordinarily well in
the matter of capital finance for expan-
sion.
It can be argued, of course, that this
money is well spent. The Common-
wealth bureaucracy and people in other
national institutions have to be housed
somewhere. If they were not to be
housed in Canberra, they would have
to be in Sydney or Melbourne, and
extra urban services would be required
to cater for them. The $56 million on
capital works in Canberra is, possibly
because of the better planning, spent to
better advantage in Canberra than it
would be if it were applied to the out-
skirts of Melbourne or Sydney.
Melbourne and Sydney each expand
by 50,000 persons a year, Canberra by
8000. An expanded rate of growth in
Canberra is at least worth considering.
It might ease some of the strains on
the services and transport systems of
the two big capitals, and in that way
would be a form of indirect assistance
to the States. A doubling in Canberra’s
growth rate would be equivalent to
reducing the expansion of Melbourne
and Sydney by about ten percent, which
would make a significant dent in the
capital requirements for extra pipes
and roads and power.
And in the final analysis, Canberra
is going to be more closely geared into
Australian life only when it has its
proper share of industry, commerce,
and private business. A positive policy
of diversifying the occupational struc-
ture of Canberra’s population is one of
the best ways of overcoming the isola-
tion of the national bureaucracy.
The overcrowded harbor
AS BEFITS its position as Sydney’s
most impressive piece of geography,
Sydney Harbor is often the subject of
controversy. There is the continuing one
about the beautification of the fore-
shores, the intermittent one about con-
tainerisation, and the perennial one
about rubbish - dumping in harbor
waters.
But the harbor’s weekend traffic
problems, which were in the news last
week when ferrymasters organised
short but sudden strikes in protest
against the rule requiring them to give
way to sail, have had surprisingly little
publicity before. Apparently, the masters
of Sydney’s smaller ferries, and the
hydrofoil skippers, have been nurturing
angry thoughts about “weekend
admirals” for some years now, but the
fact seems to have reached the news-
papers only once before.
Almost a year ago, the ferrymasters
applied to the Maritime Services Board
for a change in the rule which gives
sail right of way, but as soon as the
yachting bodies heard about it they
began “top-level representation” to
stop it. A letter was sent to Premier
Askin arguing the traditional use of the
harbor as a recreation area, that there
has been no history of inconvenience to
ferry travellers through sailing craft, and
the good safety record of yacht-racing.
And, as a result, the Government
directed the Maritime Services Board to
retain the old regulations.
As harbor traffic laws now stand, the
international rule which says power
gives way to sail has been modified in
favor of large commercial vessels, tugs,
and the larger ferries on the Circular
Quay to Manly route.
They have right of way over “any
vessel out for pleasure, recreation,
racing, or any form of aquatic sport.”
But the hydrofoils and smaller ferries
owned by the Sydney Harbor Ferry
Company, which ply between Circular
Quay and Mosman, Cremorne, Neutral
Bay, McMahons Point, Taronga Zoo,
and Cockatoo Dock, in addition to other
small services, must still give way to
sailors.
The Yachting Association of N.S.W.
believes “there’s room for a bit of give
and take on both sides” but it seems
they think the ferrymasters should give
the most. “We believe the present
regulations are quite adequate,” the
Association’s president, Mr. H. E.
Godden, told us. “The small ferries
are manoeuvrable, unlike the Manly
ferries and large ships which have right
of way.” He also quoted two complex
“escape clauses” within the regulation,
which, he said, provided protection for
the ferries.
As he put it, should ferry skippers
have any more right of way than, say,
a bus driver over a weekend motorist?
Naturally enough, the ferrymasters
don’t see the waterways in quite the
same light as the highways, except they
both have their quota of Sunday drivers,
a quota which has increased by a sig-
nificant percentage during the past few
years.
There have been no new clubs,
because there is no room for new club
premises on the foreshores, but most
clubs have increased their membership,
so that almost 2000 yachts race on the
harbor each weekend. In addition to
the stalwarts of the Royal Sydney Yacht
Squadron, the Cruising Yacht Club, the
Royal Prince Alfred Sailing Club, the
Royal Prince Edward Sailing Club, the
Sydney Amateur Sailing Club, the
Royal Naval Sailing Association, and
the Middle Harbor Yacht Club there
are numerous sailors belonging to
smaller clubs in the main part of the
harbor.
Add to them the people who just
like to mess around in boats and the
weekend traffic is prodigious and
erratic. Most sometime sailors, who
have been out with friends brave enough
to offer them a brief turn at the tiller,
know the panic of trying to steer an
inoffensive course between vessels of
varying shapes, sizes, and speeds
approaching from a multitude of angles.
On the water, distances are deceptive,
and the whole operation has a slow-
motion quality which allows plenty of
time for discomforting thoughts about
collision.
A few years ago the master of an
intercontinental liner said that he would
rather take his ship into Hobart in the
teeth of a southerly gale than berth in
Sydney Harbor on a Saturday after-
noon. And the yachtsmen have in-
curred the disapproval of pilots of
flying boats taking off from the base at
Rose Bay. On one occasion, a flying
boat made three take - off attempts
because the first two were fouled by
yachts.
The yachtsmen were also in trouble
last year with professional fishermen
who wanted to fish where yachts in
Rose Bay and sections of Middle
Harbor were moored. Many of the
moorings, the fishermen maintained,
were registered fishing grounds to which
they had the right. Sydney Harbor may
have 13,600 acres of water, but that, it
seems, is not enough for everybody.
Yet it would be unfair, and ironic, to
restrict the presence of pleasure craft
on Sydney Harbor, since the harbor is
marked as a recreational area on the
plans of the City of Sydney. Instead,
the Maritime Services Board has been
given the power to make “on the spot”
fines for boating offences including
speeding.
Despite all this, sailing craft do have
a fairly respectable safety record, con-
sidering their numbers. Certainly,
there have been collisions with ferries,
but ferries have also collided with one
another, with larger vessels, trawlers,
launches, and the wharves.


The
other
poets
By SANDRA HALL
Geoffrey Lehmann, 28, finds the law and poetry perfectly compatible
AUSTRALIAN POETRY has under-
gone something of a university take-
over since the ardent days of the
nationalism of the balladeers. Judith
Wright has written of the “new
academic industry of Australian litera-
ture” as a development to be watched
warily, and it’s easy to understand why.
Today, when time for contemplation
is short, poetry has a limited public,
and university patronage is necessary,
so poetry seems bound within a tight
cannibalistic circle of poets, critics, and
academics.
New anthologies are assessed on the
basis of who has been left out, and on
the number of pages allotted each poet
included. Cliques.proliferate, yet, para-
doxically, particular schools of poetry
haven’t formed, and individuality man-
ages to flourish in these hothouse
conditions.
Younger poets find it easier than
ever before to have their work pub-
lished. As one poet puts it, “anyone
who can string a stanza together, how-
ever loosely, gets into print somewhere.”
Rodney Hall, Charles Higham, and
Geoffrey Lehmann are three poets who
have little in common, except that they
can “string stanzas together” very pro-
fessionally indeed.
Poets are usually other things as well.
Charles Higham is a journalist, film
critic, and film historian. In fact, his
preoccupation with cinema, which has
taken him to Hollywood five times, is
inseparable from any discussion of him
as a poet.
“Both arts,” he says, “share highly
charged emotional images. Painting is
simply images, film has human or emo-
tional connotations, and a vivid stab-
bing rhythm like poetry.”
He is one of those film buffs with
an encyclopedic knowledge of his sub-
ject and total recall, which he swears
can take him frame by frame back to
the films of his childhood. What began
as escapism has turned gradually into
a professional study. Escapism, too, has
moulded his poetry, the imagery of
which is described with a hint of dis-
approval by more austere poets as
“lush,” “exotic,” or both.
The son of a British advertising
man, Sir Charles Fredrick Higham, who
has written books on communica-
tions, Higham talks in typically quot-
able terms of a childhood remote from
the Depression going on around him.
“We took a cruise to North America
every year, so the exotic side of my
imagination grew in an ambience of
palm trees and technicolor sunsets. In
contrast, England was black and cheer-
less and I longed to get away from
the public-school drabness.”
He was writing poetry all the time
(his first poem was published in “John
O’London’s Weekly” when he was
14), and when he left school to work
for Macmillan’s, in the educational
books department, he wrote more
for the “Poetry Quarterly” and for the
“Poetry Review,” edited by Muriel
Spark.
At that time, the Romantic group,
which had dominated English poetry
for some time, was beginning to dis-
appear, making room for a new school
of writing in a dry, cynical, urban style,
with which Higham had little in com-
mon. Among them were writers like
Kingsley Amis and John Wain, who
were later to use this downbeat, con-
temporary tone in their novels.
So for Higham England began to
seem increasingly unappetising “op-
posite to my own internal landscape”
and Australia, although it lacked the
palm trees, to look as if it might
approach the attractions of those child-
hood memories.
He arrived here in 1954, met James
McAuley and John Pringle, editor of
the “Sydney Morning Herald,” both
of whom were helpful, and he began
to review books, and later films. He
was for some years on The Bulletin
and has lately returned to the “Herald.”
Since he has been here he has pub-
lished several volumes of poetry, co-
edited an anthology of Australian writ-
ing, “Australians Abroad,” another
anthology, “They Came to Australia,”
and he edited this year’s Penguin collec-
tion “Australian Writing Today,”
which has been condemned by some
critics and writers here for the number
of expatriates included.
Yet ask Higham about it and he
is amiable but unconcerned with the
collection’s potential for controversy,
so uninterested is he in the issue of
nationalisms in Australian literature.
He is an Englishman who is here be-
cause Australia is a pleasant place to
live. Its beauty is necessary for him
because he thinks English poets have
lived too long without any at all, and
the result has shown itself in “drab,
bitter poetry, from Eliot onwards.”
“I’m happy to say I’m free of all
the nationalistic conflicts I don’t
really understand them, because Aus-
tralia seems to be the only country
to suffer from them.
“Australian poetry does seem to be
regarded here as a phenomenon apart
from the rest of the world’s literature.
It is individual, but it should always
be studied in relation to other English-
speaking literature.”
He himself keeps assiduously in
touch with the wider world. Holidays
in Japan have inspired several of his
poems, and his Hollywood visits have
resulted in one book, “Hollywood in
the Forties,” written in collaboration
with Gerald Greenberg, and just pub-
lished in London, and plans for three
more. Then in January he takes up
a Regent’s Professorship at the Uni-
versity of California to lecture for a


semester on films and literature, and to
arrange a seminar on screen-writing.
He writes about ten poems a year,
and, although he does know the visual
qualities of this country have helped
his poetry, he insists he doesn’t know
how his poems germinate. He has said
as much in one of them:
“You see the curtains falling in a
certain way,
Or notice the ocean’s louder than
it’s been before,
And out there on the beach the surf-
boys crying
And of a sudden the thing is sitting
in your belly . . .”
“It’s quite true,” he says, “I work
differently from any poet I’ve ever
spoken to about this. The poem arrives
there. I can actually see it and hear it
complete, and I have to hurry to get it
down.
“The University of Buffalo, in New
York, collects original manuscripts of
just about every poet there is. A few
years ago, they asked me for a collec-
tion. I sent them some which were done
in copperplate handwriting. They wrote
back and said, ‘No, we want originals,’
and I said, ‘But these are originals.’
They were. Yet even now I don’t think
they believe me.
“I’ve always written that way —and
I really only understand the poems
afterward, as if they’d been done by
somebody else.”
Rodney Hall has the anarchistic look
of the ’sixties, produced by a neat black
beard in conjunction with steel-rimmed
glasses, but it doesn’t mean much, since
he has a great deal of respect for order.
Remembering his days in London
working for Thomas Cook’s, the travel
agency, he talks about the Continental
railway timetable he helped compile
with almost as much reverence as the
new poetry anthology he has co-edited,
and he’s looking forward to cataloguing
one day the store of ideas now scattered
at random through hundreds of his
notebooks.
“I’ve taken them down as they’ve
occurred to me,” he says, nodding
toward the filing cabinet next to his
desk. “And since I have an orderly
mind it worries me that I can’t make
use of them, so that’s a job I’d like to
have time to do.”
This year he has a little more time
than last, because the Australian
National University has made him a
gift of 1968, awarding him its third
resident Creative Arts Fellowship. This
means a year’s grant to write as he
wishes. He and his wife and their three
children have moved from Brisbane to a
Canberra suburb, temporarily free of
the financial worry inherent in any-
body’s attempt to make a living out of
literature.
Each morning Hall takes the bus into
his office at the University to work on
his poetry, a 30,000-word monograph on
the Queensland painter Andrew Sibley,
a book of lectures, a novel, and the
rewrite of another novel. “New
Impulses in Australian Poetry,” which
he co-edited with another poet, Thomas
Shapcott, has just been published, as
has the fifth volume of his own poetry,
“The Autobiography of a Gorgon.”
He says he can do 30 versions of
one poem and not be satisfied, or work
as quickly as he did recently when he
wrote a whole book—a 66-part poem—
in three weeks. “I’m working quickly
now, because I’m writing on stream-of-
consciousness lines, which don’t permit
rewriting.
“Poetry isn’t compulsory, but it does
become involuntary. And a poem can
happen at the most inconvenient time—
when you’re busy with a thousand other
things. You think, ‘blast, a bloody poem
coming,’ but you have to stop and
get it down. Once I wrote 40 poems
in two days that’s my record, I think
—it was for a collection titled ‘4O
Beads on a Hangman’s Rope,’ which
was also stream of consciousness, about
the individual as victim of the power
group.”
Hall has been doing a lot of thinking
lately about one of the current widely
publicised preoccupations of Australian
writers—“the artist’s duty to society”—
and has made his share of appearances
at the recent crop of seminars at which
the subject has been thrashed fiercely
and volubly.
“The poet,” he says, “is irrevocably
tied to the interests of the victim, the
victim of social pressure of some kind.
We are society, but its powers are out-
side ourselves, and the artist should keep
reminding society of its duties to him as
the individual. But poetry needn’t have
obvious social messages. If you’re re-
vealing yourself in a private way, you’re
identifying the human being in a given
context by implication. If you show
people how you tick, you can break
down fear.”
In his own poetry he tries for what
he calls “magic.”
“A lot of confessional poetry has
been written here by people like Judith
Wright, but in my own work I’m after
something else to present a new and
different world. That’s what I mean
about ‘magic’.”
The academic influence, he says, is
recognisable in Australian poetry in
that there are “university poets who
write in purely logical sequences.” “But
the academic and the non-academic
have both been well represented here,”
he adds.
His and Shapcott’s anthology would
be a different collection if it were being
compiled now, the changes in poetry
have been so rapid.
“That book was actually put to-

the symmetry of poetry is changing all

wouldn’t let me take my holidays when
I wanted them, and I certainly didn’t
believe I should be required to await
their convenience.”
Six years in a commercial radio
station followed, detested, but useful
as a source of material for the same
novel. Then he set off for Europe. He
was interested in music, literature, and
painting, but a sarcastic critic had
discouraged his ambitions as a painter,
while he had received valuable advice
about his poetry. So literature it was
to be.
He travelled Europe student-style,
via youth hostels, and in London
worked at Cook’s on the well-remem-
bered timetable and at the Ministry of
Pensions, where he reorganised the
filing system. He was writing all the
time poetry and a novel begun when
he was 21, and on his return to Aus-
tralia he married.
The next time he left for England
it was with his wife, Bet, and their
daughter, Imogen. His daytime jobs
had the same irrelevance to literature
as those he’d taken during the first
trip, but he kept writing and his out-
put was prodigious. His singleminded-
ness about literature is alarming. One
feels that sooner or later everything
he experiences finds its way on to paper.
In the past few years the bulk of his
income has been from ABC television
and radio broadcasts in Brisbane, sup-
plemented by his work as a critic. And
he’s halfway through an Honors course
in Arts at the University of Queens-
land, “so that I can at least teach
when we go abroad again.”
He has plans for a new novel, a
suspense play for television, a new
sequence of poems and great op-
timism about the future of poetry.
“I’m encouraged by the coffee-lounge
readings of poetry. There’s a club in
Brisbane with a membership of 2000.
It will be a challenge, because poems
written to be read demand completely
different effects, but I also think poetry
is going to be used much more in radio
and on television in connection with
drama and documentary.”
Geoffrey Lehmann, a 28-year-old
solicitor, who has been writing poetry
since his schooldays, believes he is be-
coming more of an “Australianist” poet
as he grows older. But this has nothing
to do with any kind of crusading
nationalism.
“When you’re very young, you reflect
the influences of the poets you’re imitat-
ing, and these tend to be poets from
other countries. But as you get older
you become more yourself, no longer
imitating, but reflecting the life and
reality around you. Australianism is no
longer an offensive thing. It’s just im-
plicit.”
Lehmann seems young, precise,
serious a dark-haired man in a busi-
ness suit in the lunchtime city crowd
nobody’s idea of a poet. But he finds
his job and his poetry perfectly com-
patible.
“The law involves dealing with
people, and I think life is more im-
portant than art. Certain people make
satisfactory lives though their art, but
I’d rather take an active part in
people’s lives. For example, this job
is better than a university post. There’s
impersonality in the business of giving
lectures and at university you’re
talking to convinced people.
“Yes, I think there’s been a definite
academic influence on some Australian
poetry. The university interest is neces-
sary, because it’s the sole form of pat-
ronage poets get now, but in some
cases it encourages poetry with a bland,
neutral sound, with long words used for
short, but with no spirit or guts.
“And the decline in religious belief
has meant some people try to substitute
literature for religion. James McAuley’s
spoken about this, about Freudian ante-
cedents, knowledge of foreign lan-
guages, and other obscure subjects being
thought necessary to understand a poem.
I’ve actually heard academics say you
should spend ten years reading a par-
ticular book, because the author took
ten years to write it.
“You can analyse poetry to a certain
extent, but you can’t pinpoint how and
why it moves. The province of the
critic is to destroy shams and create
reputations for good poets.”
Lehmann’s poetry has been published
in Australian magazines, newspapers,
and anthologies, in an American collec-
tion, and in some overseas newspapers
and magazines. Recently, in collabora-
tion with another poet, Les A. Murray,
he published his first book, “The Ilex
Tree,” which contains poems he has
written during the past ten years, and
he is publishing a second collection at
the end of next year.
“I write a poem every month, or
perhaps two months. There has to be a
central idea around which the poem
crystallises, then a 60-line poem takes
three or four hours. But I revise it for
months, or perhaps years, after that.
Although sometimes it coalesces quickly
and you’re stuck with it.
“For advice, I rely on my friends. I
don’t accept that of the critics, because
they may not even be interested in the
sort of thing I’m trying to do.”
Apart from the academic influence
in Australian poetry, he believes its
elements are scattered at present.
Factions are formed according to per-
sonality rather than because of rigid
ideas about poetic form, and manu-
scripts by “young and promising poets”
are received eagerly.
“In fact, I think perhaps too much
poetry is being published. The advan-
tage is that good poets are not being
rejected, but for the reader it’s almost
impossible to keep up.”
Lehmann himself admires most the
work of Kenneth Slessor (“he’s the
best”), Judith Wright, and R. D. Fitz-
gerald, and is convinced his own future
as a poet depends on staying in Aus-
tralia.
“I can’t leave here, anyway, because
of my job, but I’m also staying here
because I think it’s important to write
in a particular context, and to stay
close to the source of your experience
in order to intensify it.”

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMT
Factories and farmers to quicken demand
Plenty of room
for more plant?
THE ECONOMY LOOKS to be
moving ahead at a healthy pace accord-
ing to recent indications. There is
certainly no sign that the Budget has
had any adverse psychological effect,
the stock market falls being attributable
entirely to growing confidence in
Britain and the subsequent repatriation
of “hot money” from Australia. There
is small upturn in the demand for
labor after a remarkably long period
of stability. Construction, motor
vehicles, mining, and Government have
been the four areas of strongest demand
during 1967-68. Growth in the first
three looks like levelling off.
Now it looks as though we can
expect plant and equipment purchases
for manufacturing, and the rural sector
to take over as areas giving stimulus
to overall demand. The Bank of
N.S.W.-ACMA survey of manufac-
turers’ intentions suggests that at long
last there is to be a recovery in spend-
ing on plant and equipment. This has
been stagnant at a relatively low level
for two years now, and for the future
productivity of the economy a recovery
will be most welcome. It may, how-
ever, shift a burden on the trade
balance, since it induces a lot of
imports.
The rural sector, enjoying an excel-
lent season, will, after the drought, be
bound to impart a lot of stimulus in
1969. But that will be somewhat
blunted by two factors. One is the
meat export restrictions, resulting from
the U.S. Administration’s threats of
quotas. The other is the difficulty in
working the International Grains
Agreement. Supplies of wheat are so
plentiful that prices are being forced
right down on to the IGA floor. Or
else the floor is maintained and wheat
is left unsold to be stockpiled. Either
way, market forces cannot be beaten,
and our wheatfarmers will suffer
through their returns being lower than
if the market were more buoyant.
This sluggishness in the manufactur-
ing sector is reflected, in part, by the
ANZ Bank index of factory production.
The All-groups (including power)
index stood at 113 in June, 1966, 118
in June, 1967, and 125 in June this
year. Investment by manufacturing
industry reached a peak in 1966 and
the subsequent growth in factory out-
put has not been of the order to
suggest that capacity is being fully
utilised. This is an area of the economy
where available data is inadequate, that
is, data on utilisation of capacity. In
some industries, of which an example
is the automotive industry, substantial
excess capacity is available to meet
rising demand without need for further
investment in plant and equipment.
But our information is not sufficient
to know the extent of this excess
capacity across the whole industrial
sector.
In the June quarter of 1968, the
fastest rates of growth in factory output
were recorded in four groups of the
index. As would be expected, the build-
ing materials group has recorded the
strongest gain of 16 points, followed by
Group D, covering furniture and house-
hold goods. Dwelling construction has
been in the forefront of the expansion
in the economy, with the latest
statistics of housing approvals indicating
that the rate of growth has stabilised
at very high and satisfactory levels.
Other groups recording above
average growth rates are the chemical
industry, and fuel and power. These
two groups are the fastest growing
sections of the index. The laggards in
industrial expansion are groups H and
E. Group H covers leather and paper,
and the decline over the past year is
in the paper industry. Group E covers
textiles, and the problems of the textile
industry are well known; output is
currently below the base year level of
1963-64.
TAXATION
NUDGE TO INFLATION
IF THERE EVER WAS anything in
the proposition advanced by some
notable economists, including Lord
Keynes and Colin Clark, that taxation
was inflationary when it exceeded the
equivalent of a quarter of a country’s
national income, the time has long
since passed when taxation in Aus-
tralia was under that fraction. Even in
the period 1962 to 1964, when internal
prices were stable, the proportion
exceeded 25 percent, so the proposition
at least can be said to be debatable.
Presumably, though, the higher it gets
above that the stronger become the
chances of taxation operating as an
independent inflationary influence. For
this reason the series of figures put out
by the Institute of Public Affairs last
week, showing that in the current year
total taxation in the Commonwealth will
rise from 31.3 (1967-68) to 32 percent
this financial year, look very ominous
especially so when the four-point rise
in the Consumer Price Index last year
is taken into account.
To underline its thesis that Govern-
ment expenditure nowadays constitutes a
built-in inflationary force in the
economy, the IPA adds to total taxes-
the surpluses of public enterprises
(which in truth are taxation under
another guise) and brings the per-
centage of taxation up to 35.2 last year
and 36 percent this year that is, a
full 11 percent above the notional
danger level and nearly 6 percent
more than ten years ago (1958-59).
However, this does not tell the whole
story of the impact of Government
spending on the price level because, in
addition to the revenue collected (ex-
cluding public borrowing), the Aus-
tralian authorities have financed (and
will continue to do so this year, although
possibly at a reduced level) by Reserve
Bank and trading bank credit.
Admittedly it can be misleading, as
the Institute believes, to speak of _ a
budget as deflationary just because its
net effect (as in the case of the latest
Federal Budget) is to add less to the
demand on resources than the previous
one. But again, this is surely the right
course to take this year when, as is
obvious from the August employment
figures, the private sector is becoming
increasingly buoyant and needs less
Government stimulus to keep it so.
The real question is whether this
year the authorities have eased back
the growth in Government expenditure
enough to accommodate the heightened


private-sector demand on resources.
That is a matter for marginal calcula-
tion, in which there is any amount of
room for error. At any rate the ANZ
Bank is on the side of the Treasury
angels, as is seen in the latest issue of
its business indicators, where it says:
“The pace of expansion in the Aus-
tralian economy began to quicken in
the June quarter of 1968 and most
observers agreed that this movement
will continue at least into the first half
of 1969. In practical terms this means
rather higher growth in incomes, sales,
turnovers, and output than has been
achieved in the past 12 months. This
growth is possible and need not cause
undue pressure on resources, because
of the prospects of continued expansion
of real resources. This expansion stems
from significant additions to the work-
force, and productivity gains which in
part are the result of greater use of
existing capacity and higher levels of
overtime.”
MEN AND MATTERS
WHEN H. W. (Hal) Rowden hands
over the managing directorship of F. T.
Industries (Australia) Ltd. (the old
Felt and Textiles) to his offsider, K. A.
Wills, at the end of the year, F. and
T. will still be in the hands of a Kiwi.
Just how the company should be
controlled by New Zealanders perhaps
can be explained best by the fact that
though sales of the Australian company
are 1.7 times those of New Zealand F.
and T., the New Zealand company’s
pretax profit is 1.3 times the Australian
parent. Because of lower tax, payroll
tax rebate, and the exclusion of the in-
terests of New Zealand shareholders in
their local company, F. and T. in Aus-
tralia still contributes more than the
New Zealand company to group net
profit, but one cannot escape the much
greater profitability related to sales of
the New Zealand operation, operating
behind its barrier of import licensing.
So why shouldn’t New Zealand be a
Arnold Weinstock H. W. Rowden
natural training ground for F. and T.
management?
Hal Rowden retires in his 60th year
from the managing directorship, a post
he has held for 15 years, although he
has been a director of the Australian
board since 1946.
Born in Wellington, he was educated
at Wellington College and the Univer-
sity of New Zealand. At 22 he became
a partner in Vickery, Rowden and
Starke, an accountancy practice, and
this association he relinquished in 1953.
He will keep his seat on the F. and
T. board. His other business interests
are as a member of the board of the
Reserve Bank of Australia, chairman
of the Consultative Council of the Ex-
port Payments.. Insurance Corporation,
member of the Joint Project Board of
Management of the Department of
Supply, and on the Council of the
Australian Administrative Staff College.
He is vice-president of the Textile
Council of Australia.
Living at Berwick, Vic., his hobbies
are golf and fishing.
His successor, Ken Wills, has been
his assistant for the past three years.
Wills followed Rowden as chief execu-
tive of the New Zealand company, and
joined the Australian board four years'
ago. He joined Felt and Textiles of
New Zealand as company secretary in
1946 and was assistant general manager
in 1953, then general manager and man-
aging director.
He is a Bachelor of Arts and of Com-
merce from Victoria University, Wel-
lington. He was F. and T.’s first execu-
tive to attend an advanced management
program at Harvard University.
SUCCESS stories of State school kids
are legion in business and elsewhere,
but there are few to cap the tale of
Arnold Weinstock, the 43-year-old son
of a North London tailor who rose from
the ranks of his schoolmates to become
chief of the giant General Electric
Company which announced merger
plans recently to link with its long-
time rival English Electric in a more
than $2OOO million combine. Weinstock
was a bit on the young side to do
anything much in the way of fighting
in the last war, so, instead, went to the
London School of Economics and got
his degree. In 1944 he took the short
road down the Strand to the Admiralty,
where he spent three years as a clerk
and then out into a city wide open for
business opportunists and proceeded to
prove it his oyster through the medium
of a job in Radio and Allied Indus-
tries. Things began to happen for him
there, and before long he married the
managing director’s daughter. He was
soon on the board.
Ten years or so went by until, in
.1960, Radio and Allied was absorbed
by General Electric. After three years
in the new camp, Mr. Weinstock
became managing director of GEC.
Five years later, he plans a deal with
English Electric which puts him at the
head of one of the biggest electrical-
equipment groups in the world with
200,000 workers on the payroll and a
turnover of upward of $2OOO million
a year. His own private fortune is
reputed to be in the region of $2O mil-
lion and in evidence he can claim a
Mayfair apartment near GEC’s head-
quarters in Park Lane, an estate in Wilt-
shire (with a racehorse stud), a son
at Winchester, and an absorbing interest
in 18th-century classical music. The
only catch in all this might be that
he still finds it necessary to work 17
hours a day, rather longer hours than
he possibly put in at the North London
State School and the LSE.
Something of Arnold Weinstock’s
directness may be illustrated by a
recent story of his handling of a mat-
ter of some industrial delicacy. Not un-
naturally, the trade unions become
rather nervous about all this merger
business and raise fears about jobs. Mr.
Weinstock has made a classic reply to
a representative of technical staffs:
“Who would you rather deal with, me
or the head of Nippon Electric?” j
WALL STREET
LIVING WITH THE SEC
THE RISE of the Dow-Jones industrial
average to a new high for 1968 hardly
seems consonant with the picture of a
stock market fighting for its very
existence against attacks from the
Securities and Exchange Commission
that Wall Street alarmists have been
painting. And indeed the alarmists
are slowly losing influence, as brokers
conclude that the new rules being
established by the SEC and the courts
are rules Wall Street can live with, if
not like.
The biggest scare came from the
suggestion that the exchanges do away
with their whole structure of fixed
minimum brokerage commissions, sub-
stituting a. system of commissions indi-
vidually negotiated on each stock trade
—a proposal which Wall Street insisted
would end the exchanges as they are
constituted today.
Whatever may come of this in the
future, the SEC has settled for the-
moment for commission reforms vastly
less drastic. It accepted a New York
Stock Exchange proposal to institute
discounts on transactions involving
more than 1000 shares and to ban the
“give-up.” This practice involves an
investing institution which places an
order with a brokerage house, directing
that house to surrender part of its
commission to another broker that has
performed some sort of service, such
as research, for the institution. The
Big Board has until December 5 to
amend its constitution to permit these
changes.
The changes are not universally
popular. The volume discounts, the
exchange estimates, will reduce the
commission income of its member
brokerage houses by $l5O million a
year, or about 7 percent. But the
changes are not universally unpopular,
either; many brokers have long con-


ceded in private that the lack of dis-
counts for large orders and the prac-
tice of “give-ups” were indefensible.
There is even some grumbling that
the SEC did not go far enough, chiefly
from small brokerage houses which do
most of their business with institutional
investors and will bear the greatest
burden of the volume discounts. Some
of these houses are saying privately
that the SEC should at least have
counterproposed a cut in all commis-
sion rates, so that the big brokerage
houses that do a major “retail” busi-
ness with small investors would be hurt,
too.
Reactions are similar to the rules,
actual or prospective, on “insiders”
coming out of the actions against Texas
Gulf Sulphur and Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Inc., the
world’s largest brokerage house. Cor-
porations, it now appears, must not
tell security analysts anything they do
not tell the general public. This is
most inconvenient for some analysts—
but then, as some concede, security
analysts are supposed to analyse.
Officials of corporations, it now
appears, will be told they must wait
24 hours after their companies
announce some major news before they
can trade in the shares—an annoyance,
but one hardly supporting fears that
company executives would be forbidden
from ever trading in their own shares
at all, since they are perpetual
“insiders” who always know something
the public doesn’t. Brokerage houses
must make very sure that their officials
engaged in underwriting do not pass on
confidential information that securities
salesmen could use to make quick
profits for selected clients, as Merrill
Lynch is accused of having done (and
denies). But nobody will defend the
violation of confidence by an under-
writer.
Investors who come into the pos-
session of secret information may not
trade on it unless they proclaim it to
the world, or so it would seem from
the Merrill Lynch case, and this pros-
pect is going down very hard on Wall
Street. Institutions complain that they
would be derelict in their duty to their
own shareholders if, for instance, they
failed to sell the stock of a company
they knew from inside information was
heading for a sharp drop in profits.
Still, institutions are expected to succeed
on their expertise in judging com-
panies rather than in collecting tips.
But if no irretrievable disaster has
Speculator’s Diary
BUY INTO THE FIGHTS
AND ALSO LOOK
FOR A NEW KOLOTEX
ALWAYS buy into a fight. Your nose
may get bloodied every now and again.
But as a guiding rule for speculators it
is not a bad one. For, while the con-
testants battle it out, the shareholder is
the one who stands to gain. Look at the
King Island Scheelite affair, where the
Peko-Wallsend one-for-one share ex-
change bid has upped the Consolidated
Goldfields partial takeover price of KIS
by more than $4 a share. And now that
Peko-Wallsend has taken the advice
freely and publicly offered by the
Cowan Investment Service last month
that its big premium would make it
cheaper for it to acquire KIS than for
CGFA to do so, why shouldn’t others
with big premiums come to the party,
too?
Why not CRA, for instance? Its 50
cent shares are selling at a whopping
premium of $2O or so; taking over KIS
on a share exchange would be a drop
in the bucket in capital terms to CRA.
What about Great Boulder? Or even
Loloma? Which already has 65,000
shares. Both are fairly close to the
KIS stable, and Great Boulder’s pre-
mium of something like $17.50 on its
25 cent shares would reduce the cost
in real capital terms to next to nothing.
Anyway, the point is that if KIS is
worth $1 million in capital terms to
Peko at a price of around $l4 a share,
then surely it is worth half as much to
Great Boulder, which could pay $17.50
a share for half the cost in capital
terms.
The mind boggles at the possibilities
of these big market premiums on the
high-flying mining leaders actually be-
ing used; it is staggering that they have
not been so far (except for VAM’s little
flirtations around the place). Anyway,
after having a good look at the situ-
ation, I decided that the prospects of
GGFA coming back into the fray or
of another mining group getting in
on the act were too good for me to
miss. So in I jumped for 100 KIS at
$13.50. After all, if Peko wins it is
simply a cheaper way of buying into
that excellent stock. So I had nothing
to lose by ditching my present Pekos
in favor of my potential ones; the price
difference paid the brokerage, and I
have the prospects of a possible counter
bid into the bargain.
Looking for the next Kolotex is now
one of the favorite pastimes of market
men. The object is to find a well-
managed company with good prospects
which is tightly capitalised so that, when
there is to be the sort of terrific
improvement in earnings that Kolotex
has consistently come up with, there is
plenty of scope for capital benefits.
Kolotex is clearly the best example of
Vthe decade, with its small capitalisation
being a function of its “back-door”
method of entry on to the stock market.
But there is one newcomer through
the back door that took my eye last
week, even though it did not quite fit
into this category of having a really
tight capitalisation. It is Tasco Down-
ing Industries Ltd., the Melbourne tex-
tiler that used the structure of the
unhappy Astor Consolidated Mills Ltd.
to join the lists almost a year ago.
One thing this new group has in
plenty is earnings. Although its 10 per-
cent dividend returns a yield of only
5.3 percent at recent prices of 38
cents for the 20 cent shares, this is
covered 2.6 times by earnings. So the
price earnings ratio is only 7.5 times,
which looks very good indeed.
The old Astor Mills capital was
$286,194, which would have given the
new group! a sensational earning rate
on the $255,000 profit reported this
month for the year to June. But,
unfortunately in a sense, the company
has used a technique in its back-door
operation that has boosted its paid
capital to $1 million, which, means that
the earning rate comes out at a more
modest 25.5 percent. This is because
the $1.2 million Astor paid for the
Downing group of companies was made
up of 3.6 million Astor shares worth
$713,806 and $| million in cash.
This left the Downing interests, which
had already held 45 percent of Astor’s
capital, with 85 percent of its shares,
and they agreed to reduce this by
almost \ million shares to 75 percent.
This has been done, so no further big
share disposals seem likely in the near
future and there is only $250,000 worth
of the company’s capital effectively
spread around the market.
True, the latest profit was after only
nominal tax of $21,226. But there
seems a good chance of profit at least
holding up even after tax at normal
rates this year, because the 1967-68
result did not include any contribution
at all from the original Astor section
of the business.

occurred yet, Wall Street is still filled
with a kind of free-floating anxiety
about what the SEC’s new activist bent
may bring. Lately the agency has
seemed to be coming at the brokerage
fraternity from every direction, ques-
tioning its most fundamental practices,
and attacking its most hallowed in-
stitutions, such as Merrill Lynch, and
where might this end? Is the Merrill
Lynch case the start of a campaign to
divorce underwriting from brokerage?
When the SEC takes a new look at
commissions (the exchange’s proposed
reforms are regarded as only an “in-
terim” arrangement), might it not bring
up the suggestion of negotiated com-
missions? That these and similar ques-
tions are unanswerable now only feeds
the anxiety.
MEAT
NO TARIFF COINAGE
FOR THE SAKE of Australian-
American trade relations it will be
widely hoped that the new restrictions
on meat imports are no more than
pre-election opportunism. Even the
most narrowly nationalist, protectionist
trade arguments cannot be used to
justify these restrictions.
American cowmen have been doing
extraordinarily well despite imports,
such has been the demand for meat.
Prices have been at record levels
because of an unprecedented shortage
of cattle. The restrictions are a straight
sop to the beef lobby in an attempt
to win party funds for the Democrats
and votes in the mid-west States.
The really unfortunate thing from
Australia’s viewpoint is we have no
legal recourse against this arbitrary
action. Our Government’s protectionist
policies against American exports
like tobacco, cotton, chemicals, and
machinery and its refusal to make
any concessions in this protection have
deprived us of the opportunity of gain-
ing assured access for meat, or elimina-
tion of the tariff on wool. We have no
trade agreement to enforce against it.
In the jargon of the Trade Depart-
ment we have had no tariff coinage to
offer. At the GATT Kennedy Round of
trade talks we offered little in the way
of concessions and got correspondingly
little.
In the meantime, there is a lot the
Government can do. With some subtle
political work it should be able to get
the Republican candidate, Mr. Nixon,
to dissociate himself from the restric-
tions. The potential of consumers of
beef should be just as numerous as
the votes of producers. And it would
be handy for him to be able to accuse
the Administration of electoral expedi-
ency and irresponsibility. Our Govern-
ment might strengthen Mr. Nixon’s
hand by threatening retaliation of some
sort, preferably of a politically power-
ful character for instance, further
tightening of tobacco quotas. Over to

Embassy in Washington.

BRIEFLY
The GCOnomy .* Australia’s overseas reserves dropped
back only $l9 million in August (to stand at $1060.3 million
on August 28); most interestingly this suggests a net
capital inflow of some $BO million over the
month, maintaining a high annual rate around $950
million . . . August’s imports were $30.3 million
higher than exports.
The August employment statistics indicated a rather
tighter labor market: seasonally adjusted, registered
unemployed came down from 65,500 to 62,800 while
registered vacancies crept up slightly
from 37,900 to 38,400.
Trading banks went counter to their usual August
pattern when advances rose and deposits fell: overdraft
lending increased by $13.2 million (August,
1967, a $15.4 million fall); deposits were $14.1 million less.
An ACMA-Bank of New South Wales survey of
industrial trends gives evidence of coming higher
spending on machinery and plant.
The Federal Government has arranged a third
German loan, this time to raise 200 million marks
($44.6 million) at a coupon 6J percent and issue price
99.5 percent, maturity date 1974.
The markets: There’s no doubt about the very distinc-
tive retreat on Australian share markets, and close analysis
seems to suggest that the boom was punctured as far
back as June. It also shows that the really big ’uns,
especially among the miners, are putting up the best
resistance.
Nevertheless, BHP came back a hefty $1.40 on the week
to finish at $18.50, Western Mining ($11.60) shed a
clear $l, CRA ($18.90) dropped $2.20, and GGA
($7.80) $l.lO. Mount Isa lost 52 cents in reaching $7.22.
After a heavy intermediate fall, Peko recorded a net
20 cent loss to $13.95, but its takeover object, King
Island Scheelite, rose a prominent $3.60 to $13.40.
Hanimex put on a noteworthy 13 cents. Bank of N.S.W.
slipped 40 cents to $6.50 and Thiess 20 cents to $3.75.
Some hesitation was visible in London on Friday, after
a week’s strong upsurge, so the list assumed a somewhat
patchy look; blue chips worked lower.
On moderately active dealings, Wall Street also
went lower, following an earlier move ahead.
Companies: The miners certainly continue their impres-
sion of diverse activity . . . Peko-Wallsend has stepped
m to keep King Island Scheelite wholly Australian by
a takeover offer worth $29.4 million; KIS is under a
partial bid from the U.K.-controlled Gold Fields
group, already accepted by directors . . . Mount Lyell
will finance some of its Tasmanian expansion with a 4-for-5
premium issue to raise a total $16,275,000 . . . Tin
miner Renison’s recovery rate has improved, so it’s now
operating at a satisfactory profit . . . But Greenbushes
is still stumbling and the latest loss is $59,305 after
1967’s $1,236,735 . . . Exports will shortly begin from
Thiess Holdings’ South Blackwater (Qld.) open-cut coal
mine, three months after the project started . . . The
September quarter saw much lower output from New
Broken Hill . . . Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation (owner of
85 percent of CRA) is to raise $53 million in a new
rights issue; a 10 percent rise in the half-year profit has
been helped by Hamersley Iron.
There’ll be a few frowns for BHP not altering its
interim dividend, which remains steady at cents a
share the fourth successive steady interim; the group’s
steel production picked up in August and, maybe, a few
cheers will greet the coming resumption of Esso-BHP’s
Snapper A-l well.
Better trading by Concrete Industries (Monier) means
that the dividend goes from 5 to 8 percent following
7 percent higher profit; claims on the North West Cape
project are apparently coming along nicely . . .
Higher costs sent Carrier Air Conditioning down from
$394,691 to $328,918, but 10 percent was fairly well
covered . . . Founder and engineer Bradford Kendall
faced a greater slip, from $935,241 to $649,343, kept the
12-|- percent and presumably felt the full force of the
Metal Trades award.
Drink of all kinds seems pleasantly prosperous . . .
Brewer Tooheys brought dividend from 9 to 9J percent
on a marginal profit lift ... In Queensland, Castlemaine
Perkins kept a solid 18 percent on issue-increased capital;
earnings climbed from $2,610,746 to $3,096,589 . . .
Table wine’s the thing, so Lindeman’s 14.6 percent profit
rise leads to another l-for-7 bonus and the necessity for
a placement to bring in $1,018,500.
Butchering group F. J. Walker recovered very speedily
from the drought to produce an 85 percent earnings
jump and give cover to the usual 12|- percent dividend
. . . Tallow-maker Mascot Industries struck trouble in
Western Australia, halved earnings, but held 15 percent.
No trouble for retailer Grace Bros., who decided to
raise dividend from 13J to 14 percent after a 20 percent
profit jump; there are hints of an issue for a North Ryde
shopping centre . . . Buckingham’s couldn’t make it in
the first year of the F. J. Palmer merger; earnings
were insufficient for the promised dividend.
“Reorganisation and higher sales” encouraged petrol
marketer H. C. Sleigh to a record $4,667,000 (previous
year $3,525,042) . . . Adelaide Steamship crept up a
little and Qantas turned 1966-67’s $1.5 million loss into
a post-strike $2.9 million profit.

ANEW DEAL FOR
MAN AND HIS SOIL
..a simple fact, called The Law of the Minimum,’
holds the key to rural prosperity.
Rural development in Australia has only
touched the fringes of a vast and exciting
potential. But with our small popula-
tion, development is inevitably retarded.
Headworks for water conservation are
delayed. With vast distances to span, the
construction of roads and railways cost
more per head of population than any
country in the world.
It is a vicious circle. Development needs
money; money stems from people ready
to foot the bill—and Australia is the
world’s most underpopulated continent.
An immediate answer to the problem
lies in stepping up rural prosperity and
obtaining higher returns for investment
at both farm and national level; in real-
ising on the full potential of the land al-
ready in use.
Fortunately, because of the growing
awareness of the problem, men are now
looking critically at their land. Is it
working to capacity or merely at “half-
pressure?”
To double agricultural output without
appreciably raising farm costs would
dramatically raise community prosper-
ity. Productivity gains of this order are
becoming an increasing reality in our
agriculture.
‘Bonus’ output—increased yield without
increased acreage, or overhead—can be
achieved over a great range of produc-
tion by the application of one simple
fact of plant nutrition.
This fact is called ‘The Law of the
Minimum’ and states —‘The growth of
all plants is limited by the most defi-
cient plant nutrient element present in
the soil, all others being present in ade-
quate amounts.’ The plant will only
progress to the maximum ‘ceiling’ set
by the element in short supply.
FERTILIZERS:
KEY TO FARM
PROSPERITY
If the balance of soil nutrients is cor-
rected by supplementing those in short
supply, full advantage is taken of all
nutrient elements and yields are drama-
tically increased. All resources, water,
land, labour and capital investment are
then used to their maximum advantage.
This process of correction is best under-
taken by the application of chemical
fertilizers containing the nutrient ele-
ments vital to plant growth. The most
important are nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium and sulphur because these
are required in large amounts. Second-
ary and trace elements, notably calcium,
magnesium, molybdenum, zinc, boron,
are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and pas-
tures.

THE LAND
Poor profits provoke a
grumble from farmers
Not as well protected as factories?
THE DEBATE on the estimates for
the Department of Primary Industry,
like that on the Department of Trade’s,
underlined the disturbed state of the
rural mind as much as did the result
of the by-election for the Victorian
Assembly seat of Swan Hill, where the
heavily oriented wheat, dairying, fat
lamb, and fruit electorate usually sends
the Country Party candidate romping
to Spring Street with an absolute
majority on the first count. The reflec-
tion was even seen at the Melbourne
Royal, where, considering the drought
is over and most of the State’s
reservoirs are brimful, the farmers
should have been full of beans instead
of grumbling as though appearing on
an ABC rural program (these widely
viewed affairs have been too depressing
for words lately).
Members from rural electorates, who
spoke in the debate on the estimates,
ranged from those who claimed that
economics writers in recent years had
lost sight of the still-dominant role of
rural industry in export income (and
thus of its strategic importance for
the Australian economy’s general
viability) to those who, as in the case
of a Labor Member from Tasmania,
gave concrete examples of sterling’s
and N.Z. devaluation’s harmful effects
on cash crops. Between these extremes
there was a variety of complaint
centred on the argument that pro-
tection for the rural industries had
failed to keep up with that for factory
industry, that Government policy
seemed calculated to make the relative
position of rural industry progressively
worse. The Government’s wheat
stabilisation proposals, and failure to
increase farming subsidies to compen-
sate for rises in the costs both of pro-
duction and of living, accent this
the dairying industry subsidy has been
unchanged in money value for the past
15 years.
The crux of the matter for farmers
is that, as they see it, their position
has deteriorated seriously enough over
the past year to warrant an urgent re-
assessment of Government policy; not
against the background of jibes that
they are always complaining of but
in the light of threatened repercussions
of the running down of the profitability
of rural industry on Australia’s
economic position as a whole. What
in fact has happened is that, for the
most part, the farmers’ problems have
only been dealt with piecemeal; long-
range attempts to rationalise the use
of resources in the dairying industry
being an exception to the rule.
The true measure of the deteriora-
tion is not variation in cost of pro-
duction (however important this is in
the context of demand) but the state
of industry profitability. During the
past year, profit margins narrowed con-
siderably, because not only did export
prices drop for all major rural exports
(except sugar) but on top of these falls
devaluation losses were imposed. True,
compensation was arranged to meet
exchange losses over the past year, but
losses are not going to be compensated
on a continuing basis.
The best hope for Australian ex-
porters in that direction is that,
gradually, costs in the devalued com-
petitor countries will reflect the
devaluation and so reduce their advan-
tage of export markets. However, this is
not something our rural exporters, par-
ticularly of dairy produce, can bank
on. (According to the dairy industry,
some of the side effects of devaluation
in third markets have been disastrous.)
With the Government taking an
enormous gamble on capital inflow, it
will have to keep the export industries,
especially the rural ones, pouring
money into overseas reserves at some-
thing like the present level this year.
Though increasing nicely, minerals
exports and import-saving crude oil
production have yet to have a decisive
influence on the balance of payments.
At the moment, there is no effec-
tive alternative. Borrowing is still
difficult on overseas capital markets.
The big rise in employment last month
suggests the contrary. Imports show
no sign of receding from recent record
levels.
In the case of wheat exports, there
could be difficulties ahead in selling
the full 500 million bushels or more
expected from the next harvest. China,
after its record harvest last year, seems
to be in no hurry to make new con-
tracts with Australia or Canada.
It has been suggested that the hold-
up arises from China’s belief that it
could get imports of wheat cheaper
this year. The possibility that (not
excluding Australia) one of the big
exporting countries is thinking of sell-
ing its wheat below the minimum fixed
by the International Wheat Agreement
has been scouted. The shadow of a
weak world market laboring under the
strain of big surpluses in various lead-
ing wheat - exporting countries, and
reduced import requirements of some
of the major consumers with some pro-
duction of their own, means that if
Australia has a big carry-over this year
storage is going to be a problem.
Although some States, like Victoria,
will be comparatively well provided
for, others, like N.S.W., will not.
Farmers, incensed by the word “hand-
outs” for Government assistance they
get to help keep them up with the
factory industry Joneses, who are so
cosily protected under tariffs, feel they
would be rubbished quickly enough if
a balance of payments crisis arose
even though the rest of the economy
is being urged forward by high Gov-
ernment spending and big wage
increases to set the scene for one, in
the event of capital inflow falling down
on its balancing of payments job.
No wonder some of the farmers are
scouting the possibility that a balance
of payments crisis is just over the
horizon, bringing with it the devaluation
they now believe to be the only sure
way (as Mr. McEwen has probably
thought all along) of redressing the
balance of forces operating against
them. After the wheat let-down, they
have obviously lost a lot of their faith
in the power of their political tail to
wag the Government dog. By next
Melbourne Show time they could be all
smiles again.

reproduced against a jet-black back-
ground, decorates the front cover. Pre-
sumably the symbolism is of Scientific
Light, not only penetrating the univer-
sal darkness but brightening it with
colorful variety and adding spice and
novelty to the life of man. Inside,
there are many more startling pictures.
Some of them even manage to make
staid old Dame Agriculture look inter-
esting. There are also intriguing head-
ings such as “Biosuper,” “Project Wan-
gara” (“wangara” being an Aboriginal
word for west wind), “Sex attractants
and fruit flies,” “Fleas against the
rabbit,” and “Whiter and brighter
wool.” The Report, tabled at the
Budget session of the Commonwealth
Parliament, is obviously meant to im-
press in these competitive days when
the universities and other institutions
where science is pursued are challeng-
ing the CSIRO for a greater share of
the taxpayer’s research dollar.
Last financial year the CSIRO spent
$42.5 million, of which about three-
quarters came from the Common-
wealth’s Treasury. Most of the remain-
der was contributed by the wool, meat,
wheat, dairying, and tobacco industries.
For the present year the total funds
available to the Organisation have been
increased to nearly $49 million. Much
of this increase will be consumed by
higher salaries for the scientists, new
laboratories, extensions to old ones,
maintenance of the numerous existing
buildings, and extra equipment.
However, half a million dollars will
remain, to get some new research pro-
jects started. In agriculture, these will
include further investigations on the
arid country with a view to preventing
its further deterioration, animal diseases
in northern Australia, the development
of certain completely new types of
insecticides, molecular genetics, and
the mechanical harvesting of grapes.
Biosuper is an ingenious invention by
the Organisation’s soil scientists which
promises to facilitate the exploitation of
the low-grade deposits of rock phos-
phate that have been found lately in
the far north. It is a form of super-
phosphate that is made by pelleting
rock phosphate with sulphur and cer-
tain bacteria called thiobacilli. When
these pellets are added to the soil, the
thiobacilli slowly convert the sulphur
into sulphuric acid, which reacts with
the rock phosphate to produce super-
phosphate. In short, the bacteria are
harnessed to perform a major part of
the ordinary manufacturing process.
Biosuper is a slow-acting, long-term
fertiliser intended for maintenance
growth rather than for pasture establish-
ment. It could be better than ordinary
super on light, sandy soils from which
added phosphorus is readily leached,
and on lateritic soils which tend to bind
the phosphorus molecules on to the soil
particles where they are unavailable
for uptake by the plants.
In northern Australia the biosuper
should have a considerable economic
advantage because of the cost of freight-
ing in sulphuric acid or ordinary super-
phosphate. Field trials to test its efficacy
on Northern Territory crops such as
rice, sorghum, and Townsville lucerne
are now being carried out.
A quick flip through the report is
enough to convince anyone that the
CSIRO is doing a passably good job
within the framework it has set up for
itself. But at the end one is left reflect-
ing that the framework itself hasn’t
changed much in 20 years, though in
that time the world has changed a great
deal and is continuing to change at an
ever-increasing rate with the explosion
of scientific findings. This is equally
true for agriculture as for manufactur-
ing and war-making. And agriculture,
incidentally, is not just biology, or
engineering, or economics, or manage-
ment, but all of these things and more
besides. The scientific findings them-
serves, of course, contain no inherent
impetus toward change no matter how
numerous or sophisticated they may be.
Change occurs only when a man
takes hold of one of the new tools pro-
duced by science and does something
with it that he could not have done
before. Obviously, the man must first
know of the existence of the new tool
and understand its capabilities, how to
operate it, and so on. Then, when he
does use it, the consequences are rarely
restricted to his own immediate affairs.
Examples abound. Thus, cotton research
projects spawn Ord River schemes.
The new possibilities and opportun-
ities created by science call for the re-
organisation of the human commun-
ities so that they can exploit the new
findings properly and cope with their
effects, not all of which are invariably
pleasant. Although scientific research
will undoubtedly and properly continue
to concern itself primarily with the
material aspects of production, the time
has surely come when it should pay
greater attention to the pathways by
which production is realised and to the
people who are enmeshed in them and
affected by the products.
This means taking a greater interest
in communicating and explaining the
findings and in the social aspects which
involve human behaviour. Social science
has come a long way in the past 20 years
and has demonstrated that it can im-
prove the quality of the life of man
just as the classical sciences have im-
proved the quantifiable aspects of liv-
ing. It seems ridiculous to go on put-
ting all our research emphasis on find-
ing better ways to obtain unimproved
wants.
The Report contains a special appeal
for “rangelands research” whatever
rangelands may be. It asserts that two-
thirds of this homeland of ours is in
acute danger of being reduced to
irremediable wastelands through the
exploitative grazing systems imposed by
some of our more ignorant and un-
scrupulous landholders. In other words,
the CSIRO is calling for a compre-
hensive ecological study in which man
himself and the prevailing social system
are the principle factors. Perhaps, semi-
consciously, the CSIRO is adopting at
last a social conscience.

1890: Emil von Behring
ends the dread of diphtheria
One of the outstanding men of science who has worked in close
harmony with Hoechst was Emil von Behring, a Nobel Prize
winner, whose research in 1890 heralded the introduction of
serum therapy and ended the dread of diphtheria and tetanus.
Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich are other Nobel Prize winners who
have made decisive contributions to the development of chemo-
therapy during their association with Hoechst.
But these names and their discoveries are only a few highlights
in the history of Farbwerke Hoechst AG, now the 15th biggest
company in the world outside the U.S.A. By pursuing a relentless
policy of research for more than a century, Hoechst has made a
multitude of discoveries in the chemistry that has changed our
lives.
Hoechst has long been active in Australia, supplying essential
plant protection chemicals and a wide range of pharmaceuticals.
In a recent contribution to this country's development, Hoechst
began producing the plastics raw. material Hostalen® at a new
$lO million plant at Altona, Victoria.

TWO LIVELY ONES
AMONG THE
RETAIL GIANTS
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
THERE HAVE been some pretty good
retail trade results so far for 1967-68
and so there should have been. It was
a good year for retail sales, the best
for a long time. True, the official retail
sales statistics show an only modest
rise of 6.3 percent during the year. But
these do not tell the real story for the
big department stores; the best picture
of how the big retailers are doing
comes from the national income
statistics of consumer spending on the
items that these stores depend mostly
for their sales, such as clothing, foot-
wear and drapery, electrical goods, and
other household durables.
The reality has been that these goods
had a much slower growth rate in sales
over the previous two years than total
retail sales, which .have been inflated
by the other items like food, in which
the chainstores take such a role, or
drink. In the two years to 1966-67,
total retail sales rose by 11.3 percent,
while consumer spending on depart-
ment store lines rose by only half that
rate; it was only in the latest year, to
June, 1968, that department store lines
kept pace with the overall rise in retail
sales, rising by 6.7 percent overall.
So the big department stores should
have done a lot better in 1967-68 than
in previous years especially those
that have increased their outlets.
And, with the exception of Myer’s,
which has some good excuses, and
David Jones’, which has got itself into
a dull rut, the leading retailers have
been coming out with greatly improved
results for 1967-68. The 50 percent
jump by Waltons (helped along by tax
concessions, admittedly) and the 20
percent leap by Grace Bros, shows
just where the growth is and it is
clearly not in the city. Details of the
Myer’s profit downturn (due entirely
to the new higher rate of company
tax) have not yet been released, but
it is clear that the company’s
profitability has naturally been hit by
the unfortunate combination of drought
in Victoria and South Australia (where
it is strongest), the heavy expenses
involved in setting up two new
regional shopping centres (and prepar-
ing to open a third), and a price war
in electrical consumer durables in
Melbourne. There is nothing gloomy
in Myer’s long-term prospects because
of this; on the contrary, this year
should see considerable profit growth
as the new centres contribute to profit
and as the improvement in rural
spending, following good seasonal con-
ditions in southern Victoria, brings a
recovery in sales.
David Jones’ problem seems to be
that it is probably too good to its
customers for its shareholders’ good;
the customer is always right and, no
doubt, the goodwill the company gets
will stand it in good stead when things
are tough. But right now DJs’ only
modest profit rise of 5J percent on
undisclosed (but record) sales leaves
it a long way back in the field, particu-
larly as it has no real excuses like
Myer, although it has been modernising
and expanding some stores. In fact,
DJs is entering a period of significant
expansion with its $lO million Mt.
Gravatt shopping centre project near
Brisbane that could disturb profitability
until it begins to contribute to earn-
ings in 1970.
The lively two, Grace Bros, and
Waltons, are doing almost too well to
be true. Waltons will have to work
hard to keep up last year’s 27£ percent
earning rate now that its tax losses
from the Marcus Clark acquisition are
running out. Normal tax would have
chopped the $5 million net profit back
to about $3 million. And to keep up
the present earning rate in the face of
a full tax charge, the company would
have to lift its pre-tax earnings by 40
percent. So far, the company is natu-
rally not prepared to stick its neck out
with predictions about holding its net
profit in these circumstances in 1968-
69, and is only prepared to say that
“projections based on our current
trends indicate progress in improving
pre-tax profits in 1969 and following
years.” Nonetheless, it may not be too
long before Waltons does get its earn-
ing rate over the 27J percent rate even
after paying full tax; last year’s 54 per-
cent pre-tax profit rise was a good per-
formance, even though a large part of
it would have represented new ven-
tures, like some Victorian operations,
contributing to profits for the first time
in any sort of volume.
But the key retail question is whether
Grace Bros, has done the right thing or
not by shareholders in making its $4
million placement to institutions in-
stead of raising the cash in a rights
issue. The company has given a pretty
broad hint that it intends to make an
early approach to shareholders anyway,
as it plans to spend a total of $l5 mil-
lion on a shopping centre at North
Ryde and extensions to the Chatswood
store, and its current capital raisings
will go only part of the way toward
that. The placement has some attractive
features, particularly that it raises paid
capital by only $BOO,OOO to $9 million
and increases the company’s premium
reserve by more than $3 million. The
company’s steadily rising profit and
dividend pattern (the latest $2.6 mil-
lion profit is accompanied by a- 14
percent dividend) does suggest that
bonus issues will eventually come. But
THE CHARTIST SAYS: There are no reasons to be holding BHP on
technical grounds after recent market action. The break in the support level
about $19.00 now indicates the probability of a short-term fall to about $17.00,
which should be followed by a “pullback” rally. However, the overall picture
suggests that BHP could eventually fall to about $12.00 to a lower trend-line in
1969. Last sale price on 19/9/68 $18.35.


while the company is expanding so
fast, a more reasonable policy for the
company seems to be for it to make
new issues to shareholders at modest
premiums. A hefty premium on a
rights issue after the recent placement
would cause justifiable annoyance to
shareholders. Directors will no doubt be
sympathetic to shareholders’ wishes.
CHARTIST CROAKERS
MOVING TARGETS
A FEW MONTHS AGO, the very
people who are now predicting doom
for leading stocks like BHP and CRA
were listing some dramatic high price
targets for them. It is worth remember-
ing, when noting the Bulletin Chartist’s
dire predictions about BHP, for
instance, that just as upside targets as
indicated by chartists can change by
market action, so can downside targets,
too. In other words, it may pay invest-
ors to keep as close an eye on the
London market and what is happening
to sterling as on the charts of local
share prices in determining the
influences at work on the mob
psychology that rules stockmarkets.
MINSTER
TOO BONDED TO CHANGE
THE BARE bones of Minster’s pre-
liminary statement reporting the third
big drop in profits in a row was un-
supported by any explanation (as The
Bulletin pointed out at the time), so
all ears were cocked for what the
chairman would have to say in his
statement at last week’s annual meet-
ing. This didn’t leave anybody much
the wiser, except in that “the lower
profit was due to the lower level of
sales in the subsidiary Westminster
Carpets” and the peristence of acute
competition. It took a shareholder to
drag out the truth when he castigated
the board for making such a late start
in the tufted carpet business. The chair-
man explained that this was because
the founder of the company refused
to go into it (despite competitors do-
ing so) because Westminster was heavily
laden with overcapacity for bonded
carpet production.
The subsidiary was also apparently
heavily overladen with stocks, which,
in the latest year, the accounts show
were heavily written down, a matter
which undoubtedly accounted for a sub-
stantial part of the reduction in group
profit on the year from $996,113 to
$613,873. As for the plant, the chair-
man revealed after the meeting that
two of the five machines used to pro-
duce bonded carpets were idle and a
third was only in occasional use. The
prospect of getting them back' into
production doesn’t appear bright, either,
because the Tariff Board made practic-
ally no changes to assist local producers
of bonded carpet in recently reviewing
the tariff, something the chairman is
sad about because, among other worries,
devaluation of sterling and the N.Z.
dollar has given British and N.Z. im-
ports a decided price advantage in the
Australian market.
The Stock Exchange has taken notice
of all this, and the shares now stand
at only a shade above their $1 par
after being up as high as $1.70 earlier
this year. Even at this price, where
the yield is 8J percent, they can’t be
recommended with any assurance, be-
cause it is expected to be about two
years before the group’s new tufted
carpet machines (which have been
ordered) will be in production.
INVESTOR RETICENCE
NO RUSH IN CYCLONE
IN ITS earlier days Cyclone Company
of Australia (it started business 54
years ago) was more tied to the ups
and downs of farm investment than it
is today when its activities cover a
wide range of steel and aluminium
applications in both town and country
throughout Australia. So though its
profit fortunes have reflected droughts
in various parts of the country in
recent years (and noticeably in the
latest one) it has been well buttressed
by the strength of the demand for its
steel and aluminium products in non-
rural uses. The latter was not strong
enough, however, to offset the effects
of the drought in the past three years,
and indeed profits have dropped from
$1,473,000 in 1964-65 to $840,000 in
the year to June 30 last. These have
averaged only 11.9 percent on the steady
ordinary capital of $7.8 million in the
past three years, which takes in the
drop from 12.6 to 9.8 in earnings for
the latest year, when the dividend was
reduced from the customary 10 to 9
percent.
Giving Cyclone the benefit of the
drought in explaining its poor perfor-
mance last year, the return to more
normal trading in rural areas would
in ordinary circumstances make the
shares a recovery proposition. However,
they’d already come up from a low of
$1.17 earlier this year to $1.50 before
the profit announcement last week when
they were giving a yield of 6.7 percent
on the old dividend rate. Since then,
with shareholders getting a reduced
handout for the latest year, nobody has
been in a hurry to buy the shares and
unless there’s going to be a rush for
ordinary shares in general in the near
future, the reticence of investors about
Cyclone would seem perfectly under-
standable. On the other hand, taking a
cue from the figures released by the
Aluminium Development Council show-
ing another leap in the Australian con-
sumption of that metal last year,
Cyclone would seem to be on a winner
in being on the aluminium bandwagon.
But on the steel side, so far this year
demand seems to be hanging fire.
Following BHP’s indication at the
annual meeting that it had encountered
some difficulties on the local steel
market last year, last week it spoke of
a drop of 2.7 percent in local sales of
steel in the first quarter of the current
year (starting June 1).
RHODES MOTORS
REALLY A RECORD?
IT WOULD have been surprising, in
a year when Holden’s share of the car
market climbed back to within cooee
of that in its earlier palmy days, if even
some of the less successful of Holden
distributors hadn’t managed to make a
better showing, as Rhodes Motors has
now done by posting what is called a
“record” profit for the latest year. How-
ever, when it comes to getting an old
crock back on the road, accountants-
can help as well as car mechanics and
new managements.
Rhodes Motors is, of course, a well-
established Melbourne distributor of
GM-H vehicles. In January last year a
controlling interest in it was acquired
by the proprietary Thackeray Invest-
ments, the family company of Mr.
Reginald Hunt, who took over the
managing director’s job at Rhodes in
July, 1967, at the start of the year for
which is announced the conversion of
a $269,289 loss into a “record” profit
of $161,000 and a peak turnover of
$14.7 million.
The plain fact of the matter is that
the so-called record profit was struck
after the accountants had got to work
on the depreciation provision and cut
it from $385,389 to $263,797. If the
reduction of $121,000 in depreciation is
also subtracted from the declared net

profit, the latter reduces to a mere
$39,000 or so, and if this looks a bit
small in relation to the taxation provi-
sion of $50,682, then, in the previous
year, the tax provision of $25,500
looked odd set against the declared loss
of $269,289. A better chance of recon-
ciling profit and tax will doubtless come
in the wash of the accounts. But for the
time being, Thackeray can’t see enough
in the latest year’s profit to warrant a
dividend payment (there was none in
the previous year either, following 5
percent in the year before that). Any-
thing to spare fro’m last year is being
used in further revitalising the firm
which, in Mr. Hunt’s first year, has
improved its facilities and showrooms in
King and Elizabeth Streets in Mel-
bourne to very good purpose (it sold
7936 cars last year of which 3424 were
Holdens).
Meantime, the shares have got off
the lowly bottom of 35 cents they
dropped to earlier this year and last
week poked their head a couple of
cents above their 50 cent par. If this
seems a bit high for a company which
hasn’t paid a dividend for two years,
there is no doubt Thackeray means to
make its investment in Rhodes pay off.
So with Holden sales moving up gen-
erally, the shares could be worth
watching.
NICKEL
GOOD LITTLE 'UNS
DESPITE THE general aura of gloom
on the market, the extent of the Western
Australian nickel belt is prompting an
attitude among Perth brokers that,
perhaps, some of the smaller nickel
stocks might be better than was thought
at first. The thinking now is that, with
such a low capitalisation, the share
price could be expected to respond
strongly to speculation if any of them
found nickel in any significant
quantities or of good grades.
Before the rest of the market
bottomed out, the small nickel stocks
were beginning to firm, backed by this
attitude. The emerging group of West
Coast Holdings, Haoma Gold, Moun-
tain View, Hill 50 Consolidated, and
Western Queen all part of the same
stable were winning support in this
way. But of them all, the recently re-
listed North West Mining NL was con-
sidered the most immediately attrac-
tive because of its placing in relation-
ship to the Great Boulder-North Kal-
gurli Scotia operation.
North West has access to mineral
claims numbers 148, 149, and 150,
which are right on the line of strike
of the Scotia sulphides, and considered
to be in a highly favorable environ-
ment. The three claims adjoin the
“Jones Leases” to the south. There will
be some interest among North West
Mining investors over details of the
next Great Boulder report.
Behind the
balance sheets
LEND LEASE IS NOW
A BETTER JUDGE
OF PROPERTY MARKETS
SINCE the boom days of property
development and construction in the late
’fifties, companies' as Lend Lease
Corporation Ltd. have been eclipsed by
commodity booms. But Lend Lease is
featuring larger in investment attention
again as market observers appreciate
its ever-increasing source of stable in-
come from a long-term interest in
property developments, either through
a minority shareholding or through
management agreements and head
leases.
Where once its income derived en-
tirely from selling completed projects
at a maximum price, with relinquish-
ment of financial interest, now its in-
come is also a continuing one from the
sub-letting of properties on which it
has a head lease, which may have been
sold for only a marginal profit.
The group retains interests in the
Australia Square and Princes Gate
through minority shareholdings, which
may earn first dividends (for a half-
year, anyway) in the current financial
year. The investment in these property
companies (37 percent equity in Aus-
tralia Square, and effectively per-
cent in Princes Gate), represents ap-
proximately S2J million, apart from
$J million loans, so if these companies
were to pay a maiden dividend at the
annual rate of, say, 15 percent, this
year’s profits would be boosted by
$168,750, next year’s by $337,500, a
worthwhile supplement.
Should profits not increase from any
other source, a $2 million profit in
1970 represents 22.2 percent on capital
which will be $9 million after the
bonus, and open significant issues to
the staff superannuation scheme and on
the exercise of options by staff
members.
This compares with the 1968 rate of
22.4 percent. The market has already
anticipated improved results and
marked the shares up over 100 percent
this year. Current price of $2 for the
50c shares shows modest yield of 3
percent on current dividend of 12 per-
cent. Benefits this year were a rise of
1 percent in the dividend, and a one-
for-ten bonus.
The company has learned to shift its
emphasis more quickly and accurately,
according to the conditions of the
economy and the property market in
particular.
After disappointments with high rise

660
Do your letters look as important
as they are?
For over 60 years Royal has been manufacturing typewriters of character and fine precision for dis-
cerning people . . . machines that add prestige to correspondence and make your letters look as
important as they are.
Royal has now introduced their latest development, the Royal 660 office electric. The newly designed
660 outperforms all other typewriters. Because it has more automatic features, the possibilities of
human errors creeping into the work are minimal and with increased typing efficiency, your letters
will look more important than ever.
The new Royal 660 electric gives you the world's most advanced keyboard. EIGHT repeat controls
. . . that repeat only when you want them to . . . PLUS the Royal "ERROR CONTROL” half-forward
spacer for fast corrections.
You must see the 660’s exclusive Magic Monitor copy control. It automatically computes the number
of carbons fed into the machine and then adjusts itself for the perfect type bar impact. This gives
you sharp originals that are never punctured and copies that are always clear.
The first typewriter designed for the computer age, the 660 is a revolutionary new concept in dis-
tinctive letter writing. Combining practicability with elegance, it blends in with the decor of any office.
Compare the 660 with others and then you’ll know why more people buy Royal than any other make

the home unit market improved), the
company has now opted out of this,
but has substantial residential estates.
According to trading assets shown in
the balance sheet (wholly owned pro-
jects currently being developed or held
for sale), the investment in residential
projects has, in fact, halved in the
past five years, while retail projects
have multiplied more than five
times. In 1964, residential projects in-
cluded two Melbourne home unit devel-
opments and some Blues Point Tower
investment. The 1968 retail projects of
$16.2 million, include about $l3 million
in the Bankstown Square project. (A
life office has an option to buy and
lease back this project which expires
at the end of 1970.) Although this
property is mortgaged to $9 million,
so that Lend Lease’s net investment is
$4 million, it would, no doubt, rather
have these funds used elsewhere.
But directors say that Bankstown
revenue is running ahead of budget as
it moves into its third year of the
accepted establishment period. The

centre and the proposed Penrith centre
are the other retail property develop-
ment projects.
Two areas of weakness in the organ-
isation have been the investment in
Kosciusko, Thredbo, and the unprofit-
able lightweight aggregate plant. The
1967 snow season was abnormally poor
and a loss was made on this invest-
ment, but 1968 should, at least, break
even. Having reached near full opera-
tional level, expenses should increase
more slowly, and given normal snow
seasons, directors hope for a $£ million
profit in four or five years’ time, instead
of last year’s loss of $122,000.
The aggregate plant was shut down
for about a year and underwent large
re-organisation. New price agreements
with major ready mixed concrete com-
panies have now been made, and the
company should shortly be profitable.
Twelve office buildings are now
managed by long-term agreement or
head leases, all profitably. Property in-
vestment also covers four shopping
centres, Top Ryde, Carlingford,
Monaro Mall, and Bankstown Arcade,
six motels, and three car parks.
Many of the leases are coming up
for renegotiation after initial establish-
ment period, and, according to the
tenants’ turnover, Lend Lease has the
right to charge increased rents. A
“most conservative” valuation of the
head leases shows a market value in
excess of $3 million. Profit sharing
contracts have not been valued, as they
are not transferable. No value for either
head leases or profit sharing contracts
is included in the accounts, so this is
a considerable intangible asset.
The engineering and construction
division (Civil and Civic) last year
completed its largest individual project
undertaken to date, the 50-storey Aus-
tralia Square Tower, and 49 other
projects, including the Princes Gate
twin-tower offices. The value of con-
tracts in hand has fallen to $3l million,
of which $24 million is uncompleted.
There was a large concentration of big
projects in the years to 1967. For 1969
the company says the load is more
evenly spread and more natural growth
in revenues is expected. (Earnings can-
not be related meaningfully to revenue
because this is brought into account
when received, but profits are brought
in only on completion of projects.)
Projects in the offing for Lend Lease
are partnership in a $lOO million
redevelopment plan for Flinders Street
station and railway yards in Melbourne,
a $l2 million development of the Hotel
Sydney-Tivoli site to rejuvenate the
Central Railway end of Sydney city,
the redevelopment in two years’ time
of the Hotel Australia site in Sydney
for offices (Lend Lease invested $1.7
million to obtain a 40 percent equity
in the hotel company, and the MLC a
similar share), and development of the
Dalton House site for the Colonial
Mutual.
Devaluation of sterling last financial
year was a windfall for the Australia
Square project, which was part-financed
by overseas loans. Lend Lease
announced in 1968 accounts that it
would value its shareholding in Aus-
tralia Square and Princes Gate projects
at book value plus $1.4 million, its
proportion of this gain in shareholders’
funds.
Another policy change was to write
off all improvements not directly
revenue-producing at Thredbo, such
as trail clearing, water and sewerage
systems, roads, landscaping, totalling
$l.l million.
Lend Lease has made a few mistakes,
but it has learned a lot, and seems now

Mining
CAN PEKO KEEP ON
DOING THE
BIG-BROTHER ACT?
SHOULD PEKO’S BID for King
Island be successful, its immediate task
would be to assist it in becoming more
than a marginal operation depending
on high wolfram prices for the good
profits of the past few years. Certainly
the mine has considerable potential
for higher production both from the
existing open cut and from deeper ore-
bodies which will be amenable to ex-
traction by both open-cut and under-
ground mining. Any development of the
mine aimed at reaching a level of pro-
duction high enough to overcome the
marginal nature of the orebody will
take some time, but in the meantime
the acquisition will improve Peko’s
profitability (so long as wolfram
prices hold up) and in addition pro-
vide a source of funds for further
development of the mine through the
$7 million share portfolio held by King
Island.
Whether intended or not, Peko’s
entry into the bidding for King Island
has almost a hint of a “hands-off”
policy about it. The conclusion is al-
most irresistible that it is prepared
to act as a “big brother” to any other
independent company, and speculation
naturally turns to the search for a
possible subject for the next takeover
bid which might be made.
The list of possible subjects can be
immediately reduced once several
possible criteria are taken into account.
Presumably, any worthwhile bid would
be restricted to companies which are
well-established producers; which have
orebodies capable of large increases in
production; which are not already
under the wing of some larger group,
and which have, either in fact or pros-
pect, a cash flow of sufficient size to
attract a serious offer. Such criteria
immediately disqualify most of the
smaller mining companies and the
purely prospecting companies. Those
which remain are surprisingly few.

ject of rumors on this score from time
to time, but to be successful any bid
for either this company or North
Broken Hill would require the acquies-
cence of the strong institutional and
inter-company holdings which are
spread around Collins Street. Another
factor which would be of considerable
importance would be the reaction of
the Barrier Industrial Council. All in
all, the Barrier companies seem
unlikely subjects for this sort of specu-
lation, despite their wealth both in
mining and industrial activities.
EZ Industries has particular attrac-
tion with its substantial cash flow and
the potential of its West Coast mines
(where production is to be consider-
ably increased in the next few years).
But, in recent years, EZ and Peko have
built up a relationship which could well
come to the fore again if the company’s
present situation was threatened. EZ’s
articles of association provide for
restricting ownership of shares to
British subjects.
The Aberfoyle group could hardly
be considered attractive by any cri-
terion except that it is still independent.
Although the group’s overall operations
are fairly substantial, particularly
through its subsidiaries, Ardlethan Tin
and Cleveland Tin, the group’s mines
are not big enough to warrant any
large scale expansion, and overall cash
flow has been rather strained. For the
same reasons, Kathleen Investments
could hardly be considered attractive
and on past performances its board
would be opposed to a foreign bid.
Moving down the list, we find that
Mary Kathleen Uranium is a subsidiary
of CRA, itself a subsidiary of the Rio
Tinto-Zinc Corporation of the U.K.;
Mt. Isa Mines is controlled by the
American Smelting and Refining Com-
pany Limited; Mt. Lyell is controlled
by Consolidated Gold Fields Australia
Limited, itself a subsidiary of the U.K.
company of that name; Renison is
another subsidiary of Consolidated Gold
Fields, while Western Mining Corpor-
ation is probably too highly capitalised
now to interest any likely purchaser,
and Selection Trust of the U.K. would,
presumably, take a very active part if a
bid for this company were to be made.
The remaining producers of any sub-
stance are but two —Western Titanium
and Westralian Oil. At one stage Norse-
man Gold would certainly have had to
be considered, but its mining operations
(for pyrites) have now ceased and the
company’s interests are now centred
on exploration and developmental
projects, none of which has yet been
brought to fruition. Nevertheless, it
would perhaps be premature to dis-
regard this company altogether, par-
ticularly as there are only 750,000
shares issued.
Westralian Oil has an association
with British Titan Products, which is its
major customer and with whom it owns
another ilmenite producer, Western
Mineral Sands Pty. Ltd. Nevertheless,

this would probably not deter any bid-
der with real interest in this type of
operation, as the company has a reason-
able amount of potential at the cur-
rent market capitalisation of less than
$lO million. It was suggested earlier
this year that Consolidated Gold Fields
was interested in acquiring a substantial
minority equity in this company.
It is the Western Australian ilmenite
producer, Western Titanium, which
seems to fill best the criteria mentioned
earlier. It is a well-established producer
with considerable reserves and a
strongly rising cash flow. The estab-
lishment of an upgrading process for
ilmenite on a commercial scale has
considerable potential, both as a source
of increased profits as well as an avenue
for investment, and the company is
nominally independent, although Min-
ing Traders Limited owns 600,000
shares (just over 10 percent) while
Commonwealth Mining Investment
(Australia) Limited also retains a
smaller but sizable number of shares.
Security analysis
ALLEN'S IS MORE TO
SWEETS THAN THE
CHOCOLATE MAKERS
CONTRARY TO the song, I’m guess-
ing that the chocolate soldierman’s uni-
form won’t be so pretty as the big
chocolate-base confectioners weigh in
with their 1967-68 results. Already the
recently merged James Stedman &
Hoadleys group has reported net profits
of $696,000, a sharp drop on the
$900,000 profit in 1966-67 for the two
companies before the merger. Produc-
tion of chocolate confectionery skidded
to 98.698 million lb. in 1967-68, down
7.9 percent on the previous year, and
the lowest output since 1964-65. Add
in a price fight in the chainstores plus
lower consumption during the extended
summer, and it looks like a year of
melting profits for the manufacturers.
In the meantime, production of non-
chocolate confectionery rose last year
to 112,379 million lb. and Allen’s Con-
fectionery came up with another set of
record figures, boosting net profit to
$636,215, dividend to 17.5 percent and
earning rate on capital to 28.9 percent.
Australian production of confectionery
per capita has been moving up steadily
in recent years from 16.41 b. in 1962-63
to 18.61 b. in 1966-67, an increase of 11.4
percent. As the 1966 per-capita figure
for the United States was around
181 b., Australians rank high in the
world’s sweet-tooth list.
Allen’s impresses me as a company
well out of the ordinary. The Mel-
bourne producer is beating its choco-
late-oriented competitors with a com-
bination of special lines, quality pro-
duction and packaging, marketing, and
retailer service. Allen’s product strength
is in medicated confectionery where it
is the top Australian producer. Irish
Moss Jubes, Butter-Menthol, Anticol,
Soothers, and the rest have provided
the company with a solid base from
which to launch off into more volatile
confectionery lines. In the convenient
roll-pack market, Allen’s now ranks
second to Life Savers with near one-
third of total production. The roll-
pack enjoys popularity as an impulse
line, particularly among younger
women, who find its compactness and
non-spill qualities just the thing for
their perpetually cluttered handbags.
Emphasis is placed on top-level
quality control in production and
packaging at Allen’s, the company prid-
ing itself on the high standard, flavor,
and appearance of its confectionery.
Particular attention is given to the pack.
Any sweets with the slightest tendency
to stick are individually pre-wrapped
before adding the colorful, but simple,
outer packs. Production is now carried
out at one plant in South Melbourne
following the transfer of the Griffiths
Sweets range (acquired in 1964) from
Richmond, and the sale of the Rich-
mond factory. With all activities on
the one site economies in manufactur-
ing costs are being achieved and the
company’s operations are much more
streamlined.
A feature of Allen’s organisation is
the marketing and distribution system.
The normal pattern followed in the
industry keeps distribution as a division
of the manufacturing company, with
sales made direct to retailers or through
numerous sub-distributors and whole-
salers. It is not unusual for both
methods to be used conjointly. Allen’s
adheres to the norm only in Victoria
and the Riverina districts of N.S.W.,
where A. W. Allen Sales Pty. Ltd. (a
wholly owned subsidiary) markets the
product range. New South Wales and
Queensland sales are made by agent
companies in which Allen’s has only a
minority interest, while outlets in other
States are completely independent. One
wholesaler in each State, separate from
the manufacturer, minimises the tend-
ency to carry excess or duplicated over-
heads, reduces distribution costs per
unit, and allows marketing to be
handled by specialised companies which
can get close to the retailer. Closeness
to the retailer is a major factor in
Allen’s success, although here the com-
pany is being aided by its competitors’
myopia.
A dealer relationship based on the
principle that there are more little
fellows in this world than big boys is
helping to give Allen’s the best growth
in the industry. The glamor in retailing
lies with the chainstores, but it is sig-
nificant that N.S.W. alone has approxi-
mately 14,500 retail confectionery
outlets, mainly small shops, milkbars,
and tobacconists. Each unit doesn’t
count for much against a chain, but in
total they equal a market well worth

cultivating, and that’s where, it seems
to me, Allen’s.is winning.
In a cut-throat rush for chainstore
quantity sales, following the collapse
of price maintenance, the chocolate
manufacturers have altered the old dis-
count system which gave everyone 3
percent. Under the new scale, a pur-
chase of around 14 outers is required
before the 3 percent applies. Granted,
the scale rises to give percent on
100 outers, but this doesn’t help the
small trader, who has problems enough
carrying 14 outers. My information is
that the small man feels he is getting
a raw deal on chocolate, and his atti-
tude is rubbing off on the manufac-
turers’ non-chocolate lines. .
Salesmen for Allen’s products have
specialised in a sympathetic, personal
approach to small retailers, a policy
that is paying off when the salesman
makes his regular call. He must look a
pretty fine fellow to the corner battler
after the treatment he has been getting
over chocolate. Allen’s is now in the
satisfactory position of having the best
of both worlds, with no interest in
chocolate, thus avoiding the price-war,
and yet benefiting from retailers’ dis-
satisfaction with the chocolate kings.
At present, the Cadbury-Macßobert-
son group, Nestles, Life Savers, and
Stedman are all ahead of Allen’s in
market share of the confectionery in-
dustry, but Allen’s appeals to me as the
company with the best growth prospects.
The Cadbury-Macßobertson group
looks excessively overorganised, while
Stedman has run into problems follow-
ing the Hoadleys merger, making me
think the group is top-heavy and needs
some fat trimmed from its operations.
Life Savers and Nestles are also tied up
in the great chocolate battle, and that
leaves Allen’s free to keep improving
its percentage of the market without
dissipating sound financial resources.
Speculation on Allen’s future can’t
discount the possibility of a merger.
The only major confectioner not bound
up in chocolate, and with an excellent
organisation and profit record, must
look attractive to any company seeking
product diversification in lines allied
to its own. Snack-food manufacturers
have had a setback in the past 12
months and it wouldn’t surprise me if
a local or overseas company in this
area was looking hard at Allen’s.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
When the big
surprise comes
before Act 3
By DENIS O'BRIEN
JOHN TASKER recalls an anecdote
from an Arts Theatre production of
Andre Gide’s “The I,mmoralist” in
London. “It was 1953, I think . . . back
in the days when we were all still
fogged by hypocrisy. In the last act
of the play, a married Frenchman is
watching a young Algerian boy dance
seductively. (It wasn’t really very
seductive, but you must remember it
was London, 1953.) Anyway, after a
few minutes the Frenchman’s wife
bursts on stage, the boy flees, and the
husband and wife begin a dialogue of
absurd non sequiturs . . . things like,
‘My God, you’re not a . . .’ and ‘How
can I begin to . . .’ They were still at
it talking and saying nothing
when the curtain came down. Suddenly,
someone at the back of the theatre
called out, ‘Why don’t you say the
bloody word.’ ”
The word was homosexual. It wasn’t
Gide’s fault that in the adaptation of
his novel it had been left unstated.
These days the theatre feels less
inhibited, even if it is still saddled
with some of the 1953 inhibitions.
Playwrights have been progressively
taking homosexuality out of the shadows
of implication into the light of social
reality.
“Homosexuals exist,” says Tasker.
“Ignoring thejn won’t make them go
away; treating them as cartoon figures
of fun won’t alter the circumstances of
their existence. They are as much a
part of the social fabric as hetero-
sexuals.”
Mr. Tasker is directing a production
of the most unambiguous play about
homosexuals yet to reach the stage
Mart Crowley’s “The Boys in the
Band,” a comic gasper of a play which
has been an outstanding off-Broadway
success since it opened in New York
last April. The Sydney production is
the first outside America and will open
at Sydney’s Playbox Theatre on
October 2 under the banner of Harry
M. Miller and Phillip Productions, a
team which is currently catering for
Aunt Edna audiences with productions
of “The Boy Friend” and two Noel
Coward comedies.
With the “America Hurrah” trauma
still tender there is an air of wary
precaution about the preparations for
“The Boys in the Band.” Nothing is
The Boys in the Band (from left) Kuki Kaa, John Norman, Vern Todd, Mark
Albiston, Ross Osterlin, Gerard Maguire, John Krummel, and Charles Little sur-
rounding Henri Szeps... nothing being done to promote sensationalism
being done to promote sensationalism;
everything is being done to spell out
the theme for prospective audiences.
Admission tickets will even carry the
printed warning: “The holder acknow-
ledges having read and assessed the
company’s and other notices relating
to this performance and is aware of
the nature and general content thereof
and the category of persons (if any)
in relation to whom such performances
will be unsuitable.”
Which should at least go a lot of
the way to disarming anyone thinking
of filing a protest petition with the
N.S.W. Chief Secretary, Mr. Willis.
About all that has been left unsaid is
that the play is very liberal with its
four-lettered speech. One or two
varieties have been struck from the
script, but the rest have been allowed
to remain in the conversational context.
The woman who protested to Mr. Willis
about the phfft on the wall in “Motel”
should be warned that “The Boys in
the Band” is casually punctuated with
phffts.
The play is about a homosexual
birthday party which brings together
eight undisguised male homosexuals and
one maybe-square. Despite the raw-
nerved attempts to make the party
swing, it is a desolate gathering, never
far from the despair of misunderstood
non-conformity. Author Crowley stops
it from becoming a maudlin bacchanal,
awash in self-pity, by threading his
script with some of the most bitchily
witty dialogue since “All About Eve.”
John Tasker thinks the play expresses
a desire for an understanding of homo-
sexuals. “It shows them as human
beings, not caricatures,” he says. “It
doesn’t preach for acceptance, it simply
and takes the homo-
sexual and his milieu for granted. It is
not self-indulgent, nor is it directed at a
camp audience; it is just a very good
and funny play about a fact of life.”
Tasker has spent the past three weeks
rehearsing his nine-man cast in a
grubby studio above the Tivoli Theatre.
Usually voluble about any play on
which he is working, he is sparing in
his talk about this one, although quick
to tread on any incipient sensationalism
arising from it. He thinks that plays
such as “America Hurrah” (which he
also directed in Sydney) and “The
Boys In the Band” are helping to
release theatre from what he calls “its
moribund state.” He doesn’t want the
progress marked by the number of
phffts allowed to be uttered from the
stage year by year, but recent experi-
ence has made him aware that evolution
is too often mistaken for careless revolu-
tion.
Before too much is read into “The
Boys In the Band,” it is useful to go
to its source for a few clues. Martin
Crowley, the 32-year-old author, is
matter-of-fact about the play: “What
do I know about social causes? I only
wrote it for my own survival and per-
sonal fulfilment after years of failure.
It’s not a confession and it’s not auto-
biographical, but there’s a little of me
in all the characters and a little of all
the people I’ve known. If you once
get over the fact that eight of the
nine characters are overt homosexuals,
you know the most sensational thing
in it. The thing I always hated about
homosexual plays was that the homo-
sexuality was always the big surprise in
the third act. Well, life is not like that.
Not all faggots bump themselves off at
the end of the play.”
Until he wrote “The Boys In the
Band,” Crowley had nothing to his
credit except a university education and
a collection of Hollywood bruises. He
wrote the play in five weeks as a last,
desperate effort for acceptance. Now
he is being showered with work. There
is a queue of offers to film the play,
producer Ray Stark wants him to write
a film for Barbra Streisand, and one or
two of the Hollywood bruisers are trying
to tempt him back to resume work they


once rejected. Crowley isn’t moved. He
is holding out for the right offer. “I’ve
had it with Hollywood. If anyone is
going to louse up my play it’s going
to be me. Do you know that one Holly-
wood person actually said to me, ‘I
don’t think we should use actors at
all; let’s just use the people who are
in it now.’ What does he think they
are?”
With such an exploitable property on
their hands, the promotional caution of
the play’s Sydney producers would be
wildly funny if it wasn’t so sadly apt
for Sydney. Last week the best hand-
out their office could produce was one
which almost coyly referred to the
play’s birthday-party situation and then
slammed home the point that the open-
ing night was actually the birthday of
one of the actors in the cast.
In case Mr. and Mrs. Grundy should
be beguiled by such social chit-chat they
had best be reminded that “The Boys
In the Band” is not everyone’s party.
SUCCESSFUL SABOTAGE
OPERA/JOHN CARGHER
Nabucco (Verdi) and Cinderella (Ros-
sini). Victorian Opera Company.
Union Theatre, Melbourne.
VICTORIA continues its insidious
sabotage of the Sydney opera scene.
Not content with planning a better
opera house, Melbourne is quietly
building an opera company to inhabit
it. There is nothing wrong with the
Victorian Opera Company’s 1968
season that a healthy subsidy from
the State Government can’t cure.
A revival of last year’s outstanding
“Seraglio” was followed by a quite
superb “Albert Herring.” A fair
“Freischutz,” and now Verdi’s
“Nabucco” and Rossini’s “Cinderella”
leave the company with a score of
three successes, one pass, and one
failure, not taking into consideration
the matinee season of Britten’s “Little
Sweep,” which I have not seen. Not a
bad record as opera companies go.
In the overture to “Nabucco” there
was some apprehension about the fall-
ing standard of the usually excellent
orchestra due to the temporary (?)
absence of Leonard Spira. But from
the time the curtain went up all was
right with the world.
Early Verdi, and especially
“Nabucco,” is ideal material for lusty
young companies. The massive choruses
and driving melodies need little more
than big voices to rouse audiences to
enthusiasm. Subtlety may add the final
sheen which brings out the greatness
of Verdi’s achievements in this, his first
great success, but the very rawness of
the VPO’s production is a vivid example
of why “Nabucco” and Verdi succeeded
in the first place.
In Britain the Welsh Opera Com-
pany also built itself on this music,
and Australian voices have a great deal
in common with those of Wales. When
50 or more of them raise the roof in
unison, it only needs the right music
to produce success, and this is un-
doubtedly it.
More remarkable than the foresee-
able excellence of the choruses is the
continued emergence of singers who
can convincingly portray the leading
roles in these operas. Verdi is not easy
to sing and he makes dramatic demands
which have defeated better singers than
these. Under-rehearsed and under-
produced, David Smith and Margaret
Haggart were really very good in roles
which demand star material. David
Smith’s relaxed and swaggering
Nabucco was sung without strain in a
pleasant and surprisingly big baritone.
In “Nabucco” Verdi does not yet
supply the musical help he gave his
singers on the dramatic side after
“Rigoletto.” Perhaps Smith failed to
add what Verdi left out in portraying
a complex character whose violent
changes of mood range from self-pro-
clamation as God to lunacy and cring-
ing despair. But his was a much more
than creditable effort.
Margaret Haggart earned a spon-
taneous ovation from an audience
which did not expect fine top notes
cutting through the massive choruses.
The minor parts were reasonably cov-
ered by Barry Purcell as lightweight
Zachariah and others who needed more
confidence and direction. Bruce Wor-
land sped the music along with the
right kind of drive, Robert Tuttleby’s
production was utilitarian, and Jenny
Page’s costumes appropriate and
pleasing.
“Cinderella” was a regrettable failure,
though it harbored some of the best
solo singing the company has produced.
An almost total lack of production
and the most inept four-square con-
ducting by Graham Bartle nullified Ros-
sini’s sparkling score and the lovely
adult comedy of the plot, which bears
only superficial relation to the child-
ren’s story we know.
Only the singers managed to salvage
a great deal of credit for themselves
out of the shambles. James Whitbread
(Dandini, the servant-as-master) has
a most beautiful large baritone voice,
which he uses to great effect, and there
is very little wrong with his acting.
Here is a fine Figaro in the making.
Settimio Silveri (Don Ramiro, the
master-as-servant) looks, acts, and also-
sings like a caricature of an Italian
tenor. Fortunately he possesses one of
the finest lyric tenor voices to appear
on the local horizon and I look forward
to an intelligent elimination of his cur-
rent faults, none of which lie in voice
or voice production. lan Downie
delivered the patter songs of Don Mag-
nifico with real clarity, and the ugly
sisters (Margaret Haggart and Ella
Banner) were better than good.
The casting of Judi Doran in the
title role was a mistake, though her
lyric contralto manages all the music
well enough. A lesser singer with more
sparkle would have been more accept-
able. This Cinderella and this Prince
doomed the evening to disaster, what-
ever their vocal proficiencies.
Scene from
Colin Free’s
“Cannonade
of Bells.”
Community
Theatre,
Killara,
Sydney.
CLOUDY BUT PROMISING
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
Cannonade of Bells. Colin Free. Com-
munity Theatre, Killara.
LAST TIME I wrote about the theatre
at Killara it was in terms of my dis-
appointment with the backward-looking
policy of conventional repertoire in a
new theatre. Now that the Community'
Theatre has resolutely taken its place
among the others in Sydney there is
nothing to do but take or leave it on
its own terms. And, in a week in which
the only other opening was a predic-
table West End “thriller” at the In-
dependent, its terms a new Australian
play look a good deal better than
hitherto.
There seems to be a good deal of
confusion as to what “Cannonade of
Bells” is about. In a program note
Alexander Archdale tells us that the


author “has trouble in answering this
question,” and goes on to disclaim any
necessity to describe the play himself.
Certainly, the large audience with whom
I saw it came out with no very clear
impression of its subject matter. The
play is full of interesting ideas, and its
lack of clarity is partly the result of
the writing and partly of the production.
Over a 20-year period Joscelyn Fever-
tree, an antiquated remnant of the
English upper class, has assembled, from
British Colonial Company funds, a vast
estate in “the Australian wasteland”
with a population of 600 assigned con-
victs equipped with enough arms and
cannon to “outgun a regiment and over-
run the Colony.” Fevertree’s republic,
however, is a temple to peace and quiet,
run as a benevolent despotism in which
the convicts are allowed a sort of par-
liament, although there is no question
of Fevertree’s power of life and death
over them. Fevertree is threatened from
within by a neighboring Scottish squatter
(McFear), and without by three agents
of the British Colonial Company (Brice,
Aldermain, and Comstock), who have
come to investigate the “mockery of
debts and deficits.” The play opens with
the sudden death of Brice. We learn
that he was shot by a convict, at the
orders of the convict council (inspired
by Fevertree) to protect the estate. The
convicts are also trying to burn and
blow McFear off his land, again on
Fevertree’s orders, and for the same
reason.
The body of the play unfolds a suc-
cession of conspiracies, threats, and
intrigues involving power, love, and
possession of the land, with a denoue-
ment that settles the conflicts in a
dramatically unsatisfactory way.
Author Colin Free describes his play
as “a colonial-gothic comedy,” and
while there are a few jokes and patches
of funny dialogue, the humor is mainly
intellectual, playing on the reactions of
various sorts of dreams and ideals on
one another in the face of the waste-
land reality. My main objection to the
play’s present structure is that the end-
ing ought not to confirm Fevertree’s
unrealistic dream empire with its
absurd farming and nostalgia for
home. On the level of plot-construc-
tion, I felt that a good deal of the
confusion resulted from the very
abrupt and elliptic opening and expo-
sition. A one-page first scene of off-
stage dialogue, and the death of the
first agent, is followed by the only
scene-change in Act 1 an inter-
ruption almost as long as the scene
which preceded it.
Such difficulties are compounded by
the featureless direction of the play.
No clear concept emerges from the
sequence of events and jumble of ideas.
And if the ideas, which are the play’s
comic life, are not clearly developed,
all we are left with is a wordy drama
with sporadic action and an uneasy,
slightly flippant tone.
Failing in overall statement, the pro-
duction is also careless in detail. There
is no realisation of the physical situa-
tion of the people no heat discom-
fort or sense of the grim wasteland
background to point to the absurdity
of the imposed ideas. And in a play
whose running symbol, whose basic
visual and aural image is a bell and
bell-tower, it is surely imperative to
get the tower logically into the set
and to provide something that sounds
less like a piece of iron being struck
and more like a bell. It is particularly
sad that the direction should be so loose
when the performances lost in it are
all adequate, and some (Anne Haddy’s
as Mina, McFear’s daughter, and
Alexander Archdale’s as Fevertree
at least when the air of degage ease
served the characterisation and not the
actor’s own professional personality)
are a great deal more than adequate.
Mr. Archdale’s curtain speech in-
vites us to feel as if we are participating
in the development of a new play and
speaks of changes already introduced
in the text. I found the play’s ideas
extremely interesting and look forward
to seeing them in a final version and
a more accurate production.
IN SEARCH OF PURITY
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
I’ll Never Forget What’s ’lsname.
Director, Michael Winner.
MICHAEL WINNER, whose droll,
engaging film “The Jokers” received
less than its fair share of attention
among Sydney moviegoers, now gives
us a quite remarkable film, with sur-
face brilliance and verve and depths
of implication that only gradually
reveal themselves.
“The Jokers” wasn’t merely the
merry romp it appeared at first sight
• it had sharp comments to make
about the emptiness and heartlessness
of “swinging London,” and could be
described as a lighter-hearted version
of “Blow-Up.” But in his new film
the comment is more open, much
harsher. There is an extraordinary
underlying bitterness in this savagely
funny and abrasive study of the modern
success-cult, with its superficial values
and denial of ideals.
Andrew Quint is a success, with a
job in a top advertising agency, a wife
and child, a couple of exotic mistresses,
a dashing sports car. As the movie
opens, Andrew, suddenly driven beyond
endurance by the falsity of his life,
resigns dramatically from the agency in
order, as he explains to his autocratic,
cynical boss, to get “an honest job.”
With simple conviction, the boss re-
plies: “There aren’t any.” He regards
Andrew’s revolt as a passing fit of
childish pique.
And for all the sincerity of his
attempt, Andrew is unable to regain
his lost innocence his life in the
world of material success has changed
him too much and seems even to stain
his memories of the past. Thus a visit
to his old school reveals its vaunted
“team spirit” to be sadistic pack bully-
ing; a revered Cambridge scholar is
seen to be both a moneygrubber and
Carol White in I’ll Never Forget
What’s ’lsname”...a really nice girl
a dirty old man who collects obscene
slot-machines of the “\Yhat The Butler
Saw” variety. Even the old friend
for whom Andrew goes to work on a
struggling literary magazine turns out
to possess none of the artistic integrity
he had always been credited with.
The only genuine purity Andrew dis-
covers is in a young girl who works for
the magazine, but his association with
her indirectly causes her destruction.
Forced back into his hated pattern of
success, Andrew tries a final gesture of
defiance, but even this is misinterpreted
and ignored. He is, he finally admits,
caught.
Yet despite this discouraging theme,
there is nothing lugubrious about the
treatment, which is vital, exciting, and
often extremely funny, with moments
of great warmth and tenderness. Win-
ner is filled with a fine glow of in-
dignation, but he’s never just a cross-
patch; he makes his points with strength
and wit, without a hint of whining self-
pity. In all this he is expertly matched
by Peter Draper’s first-class original
screenplay.
Oliver Reed gives a fine interpre-
tation of Andrew, managing to retain
sympathy even when the character is
behaving selfishly; Orson Welles offers
one of his most satisfying bravura per-
formances as the megalomaniacal boss.
And Carol White, whom I’d regarded
as a clever but superficial actress, is
entirely charming as the girl who, unfor-
tunately for herself, falls for Andrew;
this is a glowing, warm-hearted per-
formance that achieves that rare thing,
a completely believable picture of a
really nice girl.
I won’t say that Winner isn’t
occasionally carried away into exces-
sive hysteria. But these lapses are rare
and short-lived and can, I think, be
easily forgiven in a movie that is a
stimulating piece of entertainment
which also leaves its audience with a
great deal to think about after it is
finished. It is a film to see more than
once.


Gordon Watson ...accurate and
authoritative
SIGNIFICANT JOYS
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
IT WILL BE a long time before we
get over the tendency to regard as
second-rate any artist who chooses to
live and work in Australia. Parochial
prophets have a pretty lean time in
this country, and evidence of this fact
was in the handful of people who turned
up at the Sydney Conservatorium to
hear Gordon Watson give a far more
than adequate account of two of the
greatest pieces in piano literature.
There can be few works in the
repertoire which make such demands
on the player as the C Major “Fantasy”
of Schumann. Handfuls of notes,
violent and gigantic leaps which con-
stitute a tremendous physical challenge
as well as being an open invitation to
technical disaster are but a few of the
hurdles which cause trepidation in
pianists who essay this piece; yet Mr.
Watson’s reading was remarkably
accurate and authoritative.
As if this were not enough of the
mighty size, he added the Liszt Sonata,
which could well be regarded as Mr.
Watson’s tune, for his affection for and
understanding of it seems to grow
with the years, although familiarity
has led him to attempt bravura octave
passages at a velocity which the legen-
dary composer himself would never
have tried. Naturally enough, these
quixotic forays led to some spectacular
mis-hitting, but the overall effect was
not drastically impaired. Also on the
program was a deservedly neglected
Serenade of Stravinsky and “Four
Excursions” into American regional
idioms by Samuel Barber in which one
of the Streets of Laredo gave the im-
pression of passing through the Great
Gate of Kiev.
While on the subject of indigenous
talent, I feel too few people are con-
scious of the enterprising work of our
universities. University music-making
is a joy, with tons of enthusiasm devoted
to music of real significance, which
one is unlikely to hear in the commer-
cial concert hall, coupled with the
excitement of not knowing what is
going to happen next. Conductors
tread the high wire with a mixture of
elation and sang-froid, taking disasters
in their stride and revelling in the
proceedings with the same engaging
extroversion as the singers and
instrumentalists.
The Madrigal Group of the Sydney
University Musical Society followed
the familiar pattern in their concert
in the Great Hall; five beautiful selec-
tions performed with varying degrees
of success but unfailing enthusiasm.
Bruckner’s Four Motets, which opened
the program, went very well indeed,
but lacked the opulence of tone needed
to realise fully their romantic bloom,
and the same could be said for “Friede
auf Erden” of Schoenberg, which had
all the elements of a disaster area but
was one of the successes of the night,
held together by a rock-steady soprano
line, helped, admittedly, by its con-
ventional melodic progression.
No such prop was available in the
Gesualdo songs which had the addit-
ional hazard of having their missing
parts interpolated by Stravinsky.
Gesualdo’s unpredictable chromaticism
combined with Stravinsky’s individual
realisations proved extremely difficult
for the youngsters; but the conductor,
David Miller, hauled them almost
bodily from the edge of the abyss on
to which they wandered on occasions.
Very little unsteadiness marred the
G Minor Mass of Vaughan Williams
where the group achieved some
genuinely lovely sounds in a perfor-
mance which was stylish and heart-
warming.
An instrumental leavening came with
the Debussy Sonata for Violin and
Piano played by John Harding and
David Miller. John Harding is a very
good fiddle player and undoubtedly will
be a better one still, but at his present
state of development the supra-civilisa-
tion of the Debussy eluded him. His
approach tended toward a power-
house style, and somehow it lacked con-
viction in those sections requiring
refined sensitivity, the latter quality
being fully illumined in the piano part
by David Miller.
I wonder if university choristers
could be persuaded to spend some time
on voice production, for even in a small
musically able body such as the SUMS
Madrigal Group the quality of the
work they do really deserves a better
all-round quality of tone, and there is
only one road to that commodity.
It was obvious that this road had
been travelled by Norman Johnston’s
Oriana Singers in the Three Motets by
Bouzignac, a predecessor of Couperin,
which opened the concert, again in the
Great Hall, to commemorate the ter-
centenary of Couperin Le Grand.
While one cannot expect boys and
girls who have not really settled down
biologically to make a sound like the
mature Orianas, they could, neverthe-
less, learn much from the technical
precision and immaculate phrasing that
Mr. Johnston demands and gets from
his singers. In this group, and subse-
quently in motets by Couperin’s con-
temporaries Du Mont, Charpentier, and
de La Lande, beauty and warmth
permeated everything the Orianas did.
Here was choral singing ennobling
music which, in itself, was not of the
first rank, despite its undeniable charm
and effectiveness.
The eighth Harpsichord Suite of
Couperin was splendidly performed with
a veritable rash of decorations by
Dorothy White; a vivid comment on
the ornate age which spawned it and
the “Troisieme Lecon des Tenebres” for
Two Voices and Continuo was excel-
lently sung by Marilyn Richardson and
Lyell Austen, with a wealth of scintil-
lating embellishment which must have
successfully cloaked the dark anguish
of its subject from the hedonistic
nobility for which it was written.
“L’Apotheose de Lully” for Two Violins,
Continuo, and Recorder Trio completed
a thoroughly fascinating program aided
in no small measure by the scholarly
and elegant commentary by lan Spink.
THE WORLD'S MOST
SPLENDID ART SHOW
ART/ELWYN LYNN
Documents IV. Kassel, Germany.
GERMANY’S DOCUMENTA restores
faith in the modern movement; at the
Venice Biennale it looked confused
and directionless, but at Kassel it is
bounding in all directions. Venice, the
Sao Paulo Bienal, and the Pittsburgh
International are samplings compared
with Kassel’s fabulous thoroughness.
Now mounted for the fourth time in
Kassel (population of about 200,000,
and three hours by train, through
beautiful farmlands, from Frankfurt),
its fable began in 1955 when Professor
Bode decided that Germans, who had
seen only Nationalist Socialist Realism
for over a decade, should see what
else the 20th century had produced.
Each of the Documentas has been
given a theme and there is no evidence
of national pressures as at Venice, or
dealers’ machinations as at Pittsburgh.
In 1964 Documenta’s survey of the
seminal art of this century brought bus-
loads from as far away as Holland;
maybe this time it is not so crowded,
as it is a survey of what is being done
now and one has to go to London’s
new Hayward Gallery on the South
Bank to see a stupendous retrospective
given to an old-hat modern like Matisse
(all color reproductions of this master
are woefully inadequate) or to the Tate
to see Henry Moore.
At Kassel in 1964 Moore’s gigantic
locking-pieces and Calder’s huge black
sails rising from the green dominated


the gardens of the bombed orangerie,
which is one of the three places
where Documenta is displayed. The
difference can be summed up in
Christo’s 100 yd.-high, upright, grey,
sausage-shaped balloon tied into bulges
and rising marvellous and useless over
the scene. It is expendable, looks un-
structured and casual, and is comically
related to Freud and the sausages eaten
all over the area. The other sculpture
in the orangerie, except for a Tony
Smith and George Rickey’s two floating
burnished steel plates that alternately
reflect grass and sky, is unimpressive,
and Mariotti’s huge metal cube with
flashing lights and raucous Carnaby
Street music is a monument to modern
banality.
But there is sculpture indoors, as
well, if a black-seated chair on alu-
minium steps and an open upright
coffin with a plaque reading “Suicide,”
both by da Maria, or Manzoni’s ball of
nylon fur can be called, in their won-
derful weirdness, sculpture. It doesn’t
really matter how you classify Pol
Bury’s twitching necklaces of wooden
beads, Dan Flavin’s room lit by lights
that make your teeth glow like mauve,
incandescent almonds, Thek’s perspex
boxes of wax meat, or Graevenitz’s
white cubes, which slide unexpectedly
over a white plaque.
You would have to be a parochial
critic, indeed, to find in these works a
soulless gimmickry; there is certainly no
dominating movement, like the new
abstraction in Australia, for you can
leave a black room swarming with
Demarco’s darting phosphorescent rods
and cubes for Keinholz’s Roxy a
brothel where the madame has a skull
of a cow and a figure with four squashy
breasts which represents the decay
and horror in all you see around. If
Roxy’s is not the mirror of life, then
what is Megert’s room of mirrors on
walls, floor, and ceiling, with a mirror
that alternately expands and contracts
your image? Nearby, George Rickey’s
ceiling of four curved mirrors, rocked
by fans, sways and divides your image.
Schizoid vertigo. Pistoletto’s semi-
mirrors have imbedded images that
your own become involved with so that
one is often not sure who is being
reflected and who is not.
In this context, the Americans, like
A 1 Held, who takes up a 54ft. wall,
Wessellman, whose Great American
Nude gets bigger, more erotic, and less
exotic, Larry Poons, whose dots have
turned into whirling nebulae, and
Olitski, even at 20ft. long, begin to
look rather trad. Olitski, one of Green-
berg’s mighty triumvirate, has huge
mauve- or orange-sprayed surfaces with
some cloying color at the edges; they
look vaporous, insubstantial, and as
sweet as English dessert. In fact, the
English, like Hoyland, who combines
Louis and Rothko, and Tyzack, are
more poetically vigorous. Incidentally,
the only sign of Australia at Documenta
IV is that Tyzack’s Barricades is owned
by an Australian, C. Coventry, of the
Central Street Gallery.
Olitski is close to minimalism, but
Americans like Baer, Bell, with his
transparent boxes, and Turnbull, with
a pale pink bounded by one band, are
pure minimalists, whose creations do a
minimum of aesthetic work. But Morris
Louis, Newman, and Noland, who use,
as it were, a combination of minimal
devices, produce enthralling pieces even
if Newman’s grow softer as his polemics
grow shriller.
There is so much that is anti-New
York mainstream that I wonder if the
mainstream is as mythical as Alph the
sacred-cow river: Tapies’ loose, slum-
bering texture is as impressive as ever;
Gnoli blows up shirt-collars or bed-
spreads as though they were details
of ceremonial robes; Samaras fills a
cottonwool-lined box with pins and
silver balls; Arman encloses squeezed
paint tubes in epoxy resin and gas
masks in a glass case; Rauschenberg’s
room of automatic, sliding doors with
transparent pictures bewilders with
gaiety; Graubner’s frosty clouds move
mistily under taut perlon; Segal’s white
plaster couple on the floor watched
by another female is documented with
a blow-up from the story of Lot; and
Kosice’s water-filled glass sculpture
twinkles with bursting bubbles.
One of the strangest events was
Kolar’s room full of small works of
spoons, pegs, or padlocks set on boards
all being covered in torn-up Chinese
or European script so that the object
and its ground was lost in meaningless
phrases very witty and no doubt
containing a moral. Pieter Engles, in
the same spirit, had an aluminium
frame that collapsed (Bad Construc-
ted Canvas) and another quite empty
and labelled “a landscape without
clouds or water.”
Such works made London’s Institute
of Contemporary Arts exhibition called
Cybernetic Serendipity (random art
through computers) look rather pre-
tentious. There were pretentious
objects at Kassel like Naumann’s
piece of wood devised to hold a box
at a slight angle, but most was mean-
ingful and such a show reveals how
profound are Albers, Antes, and Chil-
lida, and how trivial are popsters like
Hockney, Kitaj, Dine, and Hamilton.
It is not possible here to assess the
significance of Camargo, Johns, Stella,
Reinhardt, Oldenburg, Sandle, Irwin,
and Negret with their varied offerings,
but prints by some 40 artists certainly
indicate what a flourishing art form
print-making is and reveal how alert
the Kassel organisers are to what is
significant: that is what makes
Documenta the most serious and
splendid art show on earth.

International ambitions
TOP LEFT: Karl Welander fights the sun’s destruc-
tive power in Mirage, movement two of “Sun Music”
AS AUSTRALIA’S only national
ballet company, the Australian
Ballet has a demanding role to
fill and- a lot of country to cover.
But its aims extend a lot further.
Since its establishment six
years ago, it has worked toward
projecting an exclusive and orig-
inal image on to the international
ballet scene. The Ballet’s Euro-
pean and South American tours
in 1965 and 1966, visits to
Canada’s Expo in 1967, and Asia
earlier this year established its
professional competence and iden-
tity, and added verve to its orig-
inal incentive. So, with an
overseas tour in 1970 in mind,
the Australian Ballet commis-
sioned three new ballets for its
1968 season at home—all contro-
versial enough to invite special
notice overseas. The Austra-
lianism of “Sun Music,” which
combines the works of three
nationals—choreographer Robert
Helpmann, designer Kenneth
Rowell, and composer Peter
Sculthorpe lends originality for
performances outside Australia.
Apart from this aspect, the ballet
would hold its own anywhere.
Although “Jeunesse,” by Garth
Welch, has a universal theme, its
interpretation and treatment will
attract international interest to
gauge the progress of a young
Australian choreographer. Ameri-
can choreographer John Butler’s
“Threshold” portrays the turmoil
of the world today set to music
by a Pole and a Yugoslav (Zsolt
Durko and Grazyna Bacewicz),
and the cosmopolitan nature of
this composition has significance
in world ballet.

THE MAN WHO
RECOILED FROM
SPRING BLOSSOMS
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Gasteropod. Maggie Ross. Barrie
(Cresset). $2.95.
MAGGIE ROSS is a real find. “The
Gasteropod” is a little masterpiece, and
I don’t mean maybe. It is not often
that a reviewer comes across a really
exciting first novel by a young writer
where the only judgment can be an
unequivocal “yes,” without any “ifs”
or “buts” or vague allusions to a still
distant but possibly brighter future.
Maggie Ross’ future is here and now.
This is already a mature, polished, and
stylish bit of work in which there is
not a single word out of place.
But, all the same, I shall still be
surprised if it immediately achieves the
universal and unanimous success which
it deserves. In the past, the English
critical brotherhood has, with only a
few exceptions, stubbornly refused to
come to grips with this particular form
of contemporary writing, not when it
is pre-labelled modern French school
and is offered in a translation, anyway.
However, this novel was made in
Britain. It is not simply a copy of, only
clearly influenced by, the New Wave
across the Channel. It has none of the
exaggerations of some of its French
relations. In its own way it is highly
original.
The author is, as might be assumed,
not new to writing, only new to the
novel. She has already scripted prolifi-
cally for the eggheads’ own wavelength,
the BBC Third Program, and for
non-commercial TV, and the idea for
this book sprang from her own radio
play “The Museum of Man.” This was
possibly a better box-office title than
“The Gasteropod,” which, together with
the predigested boredom suggested by
the dust jacket’s flat, uninteresting
black-and-white aerial photo of a dull
stretch of coastline, could be most suc-
cessful in frightening many prospective
buyers away to gaudier pastures. A
gasteropod is, by the way, a univalve
mollusc, a snail or limpet. As a title,
it is metaphorically true but literally
misleading.
The story is told in the first person
by the limpet himself, a comfortably
well-off, cool, small, insignificant-
looking middle-aged man whose one
vice appears, at first, to be a scholarly
obsession with shells. Most of his days
are passed in one large room of his
house, in which he admires, catalogues,
and occasionally fondles his rare collec-
tion. However, gradually it also becomes
apparent that his own personal life is
lived vicariously, too. In true gastero-
pod fashion he is impelled to attach
himself to other surfaces or to more
active partners for his nourishment. In
this case, it is to his reluctantly acquired
wife, Dorothea, her twin brother, the
homosexual Jamie, and to these siblings’
mutual lover, the bisexual Max, who is
an interior decorator and dress-designer.
One by one, they all move into the
limpet’s house. They think they are
living off him, which materially they
are. In reality, he lives off them by and
through his observance of them. They
are part of his collection. Along with
his shells, he begins to amass vast
quantities of chronologically filed, secret
photographs of his human specimens.
Even those in various stages of compro-
mising disarray are dated, documented,
and stored in special cabinets with cold,
scientific detachment.
But none of this is apparent when
the reader meets the storyteller in the
National Portrait Gallery as he stands
waiting for a woman whose identity is
equally obscure. Like the Lady of
Shalott, he is watching the world go by,
not directly, but as a reflection in the
mirror-like glass that covers the paint-
ings. When the book closes, he is still
Maggie Ross...the power of understatement
waiting, but we know the identity of
the woman, have been offered a terri-
fying glimpse of their ultimate fates,
and have filled in most of the spaces
in between, through the man’s uncon-
sciously self-revelatory thought pro-
cesses. We have recognised that Doro-
thea looks like an untidy replica of
Mary Queen of Scots, though the actual
portrait model remains subtly unnamed,
and James like another Stuart name-
sake.
At the same time, what had appeared
initially as tiny blemishes and slight
idiosyncrasies in the narrator have
grown up into an accumulation whose
sum total can no longer be ignored.
At some point, probably a different one
for every reader, we are forced to
admit that the narrator is a madman,
the more dangerous because his insanity
will go undetected beneath the placid,
reasonable, and reassuring exterior until
past the point of no return. Little by
little the layers of varnish have been
stripped from his personality as the
old layers have been peeled off some of
the portraits he studies. The reader is
shown the man’s phobia of growth, of
change, and decay, his hatred of nature,
his recoil even from the spring blossoms
(for him the unfolding bud already
nurtures the inbuilt seed of its own
inevitable death), his compulsion to
stay the hand of time, to preserve and
conserve the solidly material. There are
brief, tantalising flashes of his inhuman
childhood, his grim father, the hours
spent locked up in black cupboards,
the reasons for his withdrawal from
living, and the manner in which he
grew the quietly contained outer shell
that encases his own inner madness.
With each new, almost casual, hint
or revelation, the tension mounts, the
threads are tightened. The shells are
seen to be cherished, because their
beauty is petrified, sealed, unchanging,
and unchangeable. The photographs
are a source of passionless fulfilment
only because with each one time is
visibly cheated. We are asked to admire,
collector to collector, the now 46-year-
old Dorothea
caught for ever in
film without her
first wrinkle, the
telescopic lens and
the fine - quality
paper which have
reproduced his wife
and Max so authen-
tically in bed to-
gether, or Max and
Jamie taken
through a window,
frozen in transves-
tite abandon in
their hostess’ trail-
ing gowns.
Flesh begins to
creep at that sec-
ond when the
reader recognises
that this is not what
it seems. This is not
a voyeur’s sex-sub-
stitution (the nar-
rator is as near to being sexless as makes
no difference), but it is a computer
coldly compiling a microscopic study of
people as inanimate objects. It is the
faint streak of madness, which lies dor-
mant in almost every serious collector,
carried to its final extremity. Even so,
the ultimate horror of the last chapter
still catches the reader unawares. It
would be unfair to disclose its exact
nature here . . . but it’s a beaut!
The book relies for its impact on a
gradual shifting of values, of stress, of
'centres of gravity. It is like a macabre
dance for four in which what had
appeared abnormal becomes normal in
the light of the grotesque abnormality
of the apparently sane. It is the reason-
ableness that is so terrible, another
demonstration of the old truism that
the unnatural is all the more terrifying
for being firmly rooted in the familiar.
In an age of too-graphic detail, when
less and less is left to the imagination,
“The Gasteropod” relies on stockpiled


understatement, on descriptions which
are not actually given, only implied, on
innuendo, on reader participation, on
the power of things unseen. It is, inci-
dentally, also one of the few recent
books dealing at any length with sexual
deviation to come from the pen of a
heterosexual female.
PROMISING EXOTICS
By NANCY KEESING
Excuse Me, Mr. Sweetenham. Maurice
Hilliard. Longmans. 25/ sterling.
Passions of the Ring. Arthur Acred.
Hodder & Stoughton. $3.50.
THE HARDEST of all novels to
review are those which, like “Excuse
Me, Mr. Sweetenham,” are written
with seriousness, ambition, and reason-
able skill but, nevertheless, do not suc-
ceed. Mr. Sweetenham is a school-
master in an Australian coastal town
large enough to have industry and a
high school. He is partly comic, partly
farcical, and partly pathetic as he fusses
about the flat he shares with his invalid
mother, gorges on sweets, suffers from
diarrhoea at every crisis, needles his
fellow teachers, and infuriates, delights,
and, surprisingly, even teaches his
classes. He is not, as the blurb insists,
a “male Miss Jean Brodie,” nor is he
a lovable Mr. Chips or a Brian James
character (to this he comes closest).
Unfortunately, although one realises
almost exactly what he is supposed to
be, Hilliard does not bring off • Mr.
Sweetenham, who so fails to convince
that, about its infirm centre, the novel
keeps building up and crumbling in a
most disconcerting way.
Mr. Sweetenham cannot bear people
to tease his dull pupils or to call them
“nuts.” He rebukes his class for such
nomenclature by reminding them inter-
minably, “A nut is from a tree. A tree
is part of nature. Nature is beautiful
so thank you for the compliment.”
But he himself derides Jews, foreigners,
and detests a clever Chinese student.
Kenneth Stubbs is a “nut” the
neglected son of an alcoholic. His “step-
mother” is an Aboriginal de facto wife.
Stubbsy. comes to live at the Sweeten-
ham flat no suggestion of other than
the purest motives on Mr. Sweeten-
ham’s part. The boy remains of limited
ability despite Sweetenham’s tuition
and example. Worse, Stubbsy fails in
the devoted gratitude which his bene-
factor demands from him. He persists
in adoring Marylin Fong, a passion
reciprocated (I thought unbelievably)
by this beautiful and very intelligent
girl.
Sweetenham, Stubbsy, and his class-
mates, including Miss Fong, transfer
to the town high school, where the
master discovers that the Opportunity
Class which he is to teach consists of
the dullest students when he imagined
it would contain superior intellects.
This part of the book is rich in poten-
tially comic situations, but few of these
bring more than a smile, and many
are prolonged past interest.
Yet it is hard to pinpoint where so
much has gone wrong. Part of the
failure for Australian readers will be
that in subtle but irritating ways much
of the social background is awry. Mr.
Hilliard, an Englishman, has lived in
Australia since 1957, and my guess is
that there has been some grafting of
backgrounds. Mr. Sweetenham may
have been transplanted, though Stubbsy
is local through and through. Yet I
know, should another Hilliard book
come my way, I will read it with more
than usual interest, because there is real
promise here.
“Passions of the Ring” is also by
a British immigrant to Australia who
had long and varied experience of
theatre, jazz band, circus, and electrical
work in power stations. His publishers
also supply details of his heart opera-
tions, which are irrelevant to this tale
of mystery, villainy, fighting, jealousy,
sentiment, etc., all set in an Irish travel-
ling circus. It is colorful, well con-
structed, excellent holiday or travel
reading, and it is not surprising to learn
that it is being filmed.
UKELELE DAYS
By FRANK ROBERTS
Goodbye Melbourne Town. Graham
Mclnnes. Hamish Hamilton. $3.85.
AS MANY people know by now,
Graham Mclnnes was a son of Angela
Thirkell’s first marriage and spent the
’twenties in Australia. His mother
returned from her “exile in the under-
world” in 1930, found the England of
that time changed beyond her liking,
and proceeded to re-create “a corner of
England as she imagined it ought to
have been,” naming it Barsetshire and
writing 32 novels about it. In recent
years her son has been at work recall-
ing the decade or so he spent in Aus-
tralia and Canada, where he went in
search of his father; writing in a style
that is chattily unaffected, and evocative
to his contemporaries.
The only trace of a Thirkell re-crea-
tion syndrome in her son’s work is the
result of geography rather than intent.
Only a writer living in colder northern-
hemisphere climes, and accepting them
as normal, could recall May-time in
Melbourne as “the suave Australian
autumn.” But his recollections of Mel-
bourne when it held fewer than one
million people, when a suburban school
could be set in 60 acres of woody park-
land, and city boys could interchange
suburban streets, open country, and bay
littoral easily in fheir roaming will
have the familiar charm of old times
for many Australian readers, wherever
they live.
He has many good words for Mel-
bourne’s beaches . . . “There can have
been few cities blessed with such a
lovely, cheap, and accessible amenity.
They began right at the city’s door-
step and only ended fifty miles away.”
There, you were past Portsea, which
was “fashionable. It was cafe society,
the fast set, Babylon-on-the-Bay; its
blaring panatropes, its dressy women
and caddish men, its bikinis (sic), and
night beach parties, its rakish, stream-
lined bungalows in among the ti-trees
(sic), and its sudden noisy trips to
nowhere in fast cars.”
Vicariously, you can drive your well-
Simonised car through a city where the
only traffic hazards are “silent cops,”
go Scouting in the hills, remember
schooldays and the unchanging cruel
mimicry of boys who unerringly find
weaknesses in their teachers, pass from
the time of the übiquitous ukulele to the
early disc records of the Whispering
Baritone, recall family gatherings and
picnics, holidays with relatives “in the
country,” and experience puppy-love
when it was an awesome and awkward
thing. It all seems artless and highly
readable, with only occasional question-
able phrases such as “in servantless
Australia.” This, in the 19205, was
simply not so.
While Graham Mclnnes’ books might
all merit “A vivid evocation of life in
the Australian dog days,” and similar
phtases quoted from English news-
papersj I found this one disappointing
in that, obviously having the oppor-
tunity (the last two chapters seem
merely to be fillers), Mclnnes has not
linked past and present, although he
was in Australia as late as the ’fifties.
To recount, as he does, the entire plot
of. Erie Cox’s “Out of the Silence,” and
ramble on about his distant relation-
ship to Rudyard Kipling, suggest that
the Australian-evocative vein in this
Mclnnes is written out.
IRISH THEATRE
By REX CRAMPHORNE
After the Irish Renaissance. Robert
Hogan. Macmillan. $6.10.
THIS BOOK IS described by its author
as an “informal, critical account of
Irish dramatic writing since about
1926.” This means that Mr. Hogan,
evidently an Irishman who lectures in
English in America,, and who has
directed and acted in O’Casey
premieres, has put together plot
synopses, assorted biographical data,
some personal opinions (both explicit
and implicit) relating to “some forty
writers and perhaps 200 or so plays.”

book. There are two ways of tackling
it either as a chatty introduction to
what has been happening in Irish
theatre in the past 42 years, or as a
critical account of a large collection of
unknown plays. The first approach is
hampered by the author’s critical
notions and plot outlines, while the
breezy bonhomie and extremely per-
sonal set of standards make it difficult

to take the academic intentions of the
second seriously.
It is on the first of the two levels
that the book is most useful: the
account of the development of the
Abbey Theatre and the style of acting
and writing it has fostered, together
with details of the Gate Theatre and
the Theatre Festival, gives a picture of
an isolated, provincial theatre, whose
physical circumstances are not unlike
Australia’s. The main difference in
Ireland seems to be a plentiful supply
of playwrights. In appraising their
work, our guide’s point of view is
based on friendship or at least acquain-
tance with a good number of them,
along with a great deal of experience
in, and enthusiasm for, practical
theatre.
The result is a non-literary, practi-
cal-man-of-the-theatre attitude, which
produces critical dicta like: “With
pruning and stronger curtains, this
would be one of the liveliest Irish
farces,” or, “Certainly the scene in
which Mulcair . . . whirls the poor
fellow furiously around the room to
extract the last tooth would be a show-
stopper.” More serious plays lead Mr.
Hogan to some amazingly banal con-
clusions: “Finally, there is little in the
play to interfere with its universality
. . . every small town in the world has
one or more Johnsies,” or “This is cer-
tainly a case in which a theme was so
searingly stated that it transformed a
straightforward play into art.” Given
an outhne and that sort of comment,
it is difficult to form any clear idea
of a play’s merit. Certainly the total
impression of the book is that all Irish-
men write “searing” realism or “unplay-
able” poetry, but that some succeed by
doing both at once.
One concept of the author’s that
appears only gradually is that Irish
drama means plays relevant to Ireland
rather than plays by Irishmen. It is
something of a shock to find Beckett
not discussed because his plays “are
not really Irish in subject matter,”
while Yeats is treated in a few pages
of “devil’s advocate” criticism on the
grounds of his being “undramatic.” The
detailed treatment of the remaining
large-scale figure of the period,
O’Casey, seems to be the result of per-
sonal prejudice but, at any rate, it
makes the best chapter of the book.
From the descriptions furnished, I felt
an inclination to further acquaintance
with three of the 200 plays.
FRUSTRATED ANGER
By ANTHONY HAAS
Ho Chi Minh. Jean Lacouture. Allan
Lane. Penguin Press. $5.25.
TO THE PROTEST movement, the
work of Lacouture, like that of the late
Bernard Fall, is intellectual fodder for
the gristy mill of criticism of Allied
intervention. However, his work is suffi-
ciently authoritative to be meaningful
to those with different positions on
Vietnam. His finely controlled style
displays both the frustrated anger of a
journalist who has seen the diplomatic
tragedies as they occurred and the
balance of a historian assessing the
Vietnamese leader in light of forces
which shaped his political career.
Ho Chi Minh is depicted as flexible,
shrewd, and comparatively moderate,
“substituting didacticism for analysis,
vindictiveness for clear-headed anger.”
Lacouture believes Ho was “engaged in
a perpetual attempt to achieve a syn-
thesis ■ between the respective demands
of proletarian internationalism and
Vietnamese nationalism long before he
was obliged to steer a difficult course
between Soviet pressures and Chinese
incitements.”
Lacouture pinpoints lost opportuni-
ties where Washington has failed to
press for peaceful solutions to the Viet-
namese conflict, and describes the
beginning of the new phase in the
“struggle” as occurring, not after the
Geneva Conference in 1954 “as the
result of the simple substitution of
American for French aggressors, but in
1950 when the colonial expedition
mounted by Paris turned into a Franco-
American anti-Communist crusade car-
ried on side by side with the Korean
War.”
Of the February, 1965, decision of
the Americans to bomb North Vietnam,
Lacouture calls it merely strategy to
give them something they could barter.
“Previously the United States had held
precious few trump cards; now she
could afford to halt the bombing in
return for the withdrawal of North
Vietnamese units.” But he argues that
Hanoi committed a tactical error by
playing into the Americans’ hands by
making the cessation of bombing an
essential preliminary to negotiations.
The bombing, Lacouture insists, so
flagrantly violated the fundamental
articles of the Geneva agreement that
there was every justification for Hanoi’s
overt intervention.
The book was first published in
French before the Paris peace talks
began, but this has not prevented
Lacouture from offering relevant pre-
dictions . . . “even if Ho Chi Minh
does not live to see Vietnam reunified
and independent all the way from the
China border to Cape Canau, others—
deputies whom he has moulded for no
other purpose and who have fought
hard themselves—will live to see it for
him.”
Readers would have been better
served had Lacouture gone into more
detail more often, and although sources
were doubtless a problem for him cer-
tain phases of his narrative are dis-
appointingly weak for this reason. He
talks vaguely, for example, of the inci-
dents in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1965,
implying, but not actually stating, that
the Americans provoked them. Perhaps
he does not really know and takes a
lazy way out. The most useful correc-
tive will be for Lacouture to keep
writing and researching on this crisis
period in history.


Letters
Aboriginal education
I read with some interest your news
story (8., August 31) of the $400,000
Catts bequest for Aboriginal education.
This kind of contribution raises the
issue of how is Aboriginal education
best aided. There are at the moment a
great number of groups of varying size
which give a wide range of scholarship
assistance. This is unco-ordinated and
in many cases wasteful.
Last year at the national conference
of Local Abschol directors this prob-
lem was raised, and it was decided to
press for a National Aboriginal Educa-
tion Foundation. This Foundation,
whose Board would have a majority of
Aboriginal people, would receive
private donations and a $1 for $1 sub-
sidy from the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. It would not only grant scholar-
ship assistance but would also finance
and carry out much needed research
into the particular problems faced by
Aboriginal people (both child and
adult) in gaining an equal education.
There is at the moment a grave
disproportion of assistance available.
Victoria, with few Aborigines, offers
more assistance than S.A. is able to.
Also many small organisations are not
trained to distribute their assistance
wisely. Abschol does not (and cannot)
claim any special position, but being the
only national body we realise how few
and disorganised the resources are. If
the Federal Government is sincere in
assisting Aboriginal education, the
rationalisation and enlargement of
scholarships would seem the place to
start.

Those "urban Ords"
Mr. Templeman (8., September 14)
has misread my conclusions on the
Sydney Eastern Suburbs underground
project. I only said that “Prima facie,
these (underground railway) projects
look like urban Ords.” In a more ex-
haustive examination of the Melbourne
and Sydney proposals (8., July 27),
and after getting the views of all the
specialists I could contact, I came to
the conclusion that the Sydney scheme
could be “a really good social invest-
ment." This was conditional on positive
policies of maintaining the central busi-
ness district of downtown Sydney as
the centre for office workers, and of
developing the Eastern Suburbs as a
high-density dormitory area for some
of those office workers. It was also
conditional on the line using modern
high-speed equipment as recommended
by the consulting firm of De Leuw,
Gather, and of terminating the line at
Bondi Junction rather than continuing
it south into low-density suburbs which
will always be best served by road.
Mr. Templeman’s point about rail-
ways being physically more efficient
than roads in . transport capacity is
only of limited relevance. For an in-
creasing number of journeys people
simply find private cars decisively more
convenient and personally efficient
because they can be made to travel
door to door rather than moving
rigidly from station to station or stop
to stop, and therefore necessitating
complementary transport at each end
and a lot of costly waiting. That is why
big investments in urban railways are
“prima facie urban Ords.” That fact
does not however mean that every
such project is to be rejected, only
that it will need thorough analysis and
justification.

Mutant young?
Your (anonymous) commentator on the
U.S.A. “Candidates for Crisis” (8.,
Sept. 7) has referred to the victorious
delegates at the Republican Conven-
tion, who had determined, as in the
primitive tribal society, that it had
become necessary that the young should
be put down. He then implies that the
same delegates’ nominee is likely to
obtain the majority’s vote in November.
Would you not say that, in fact,
Russian intervention in Czechoslovakia
and the Pope’s pronouncements on
contraception are indeed part of a world
pattern of unease? That it becomes not
power against power, or ideology against
ideology, but the old and conservative
against a young so different that they
may be a mutation? I refer you to the
author John Wyndham.

Decentralisation
Re some of the statements in “The
Coming Revolt of the Cities” (8.,
August 31), I feel your readers would
find it very interesting to read a book
by Prof. Neutze of ANU on the
“Economic Size of Cities.” Generally,
the most satisfactory size, from the over-
all communities view (i.e., cheapest
living costs with reasonable amen-
ities), is in the range of 200,000 to
500,000. Any increase in population
above this immediately raises the cost
of basic essentials, e.g., sewerage, water
reticulation, transport, and many
others for which the public must pay.
It must be admitted, however, that
within limits a big city is more amen-
able to the industrialist.
It is hardly being reasonable to
expect country people to carry the
burden of higher education costs,
poorer medical services, roads, etc., if
we are going to increase the money
spent in the city. As the industrialist
is the person who benefits most from
centralisation, then let him pay more
for the spiralling urban costs, which
are at present being paid by the
community. Alternatively, levy a tax
where any further industrial growth
creates a greater demand on the public
services, and use this tax to give con-
cessions for industrial decentralisation
in a few select areas (shown as being
economically feasible).
I also doubt very much that the
Country Party stands to benefit from
a decentralisation policy, which would
mean greater urbanisation of some
country electorates. Finally, we must
base our development on a sound
economic ground rather than emotion-
alism.

Sugar a good bet
Your article “Backing the best bets”
(8., Sept. 7) states that the sugar
industry is inefficient as well as lacking
markets. A sugar producer, I feel that
I must challenge this statement in your
anonymous article.
The Australian sugar producer is pro-
ducing sugar as cheaply, if not more so,
than any other country in the world.
This is the only yardstick that can be
used to measure the efficiency of an
industry. The present world-market
price of sugar bears no relationship
whatsoever to the cost of production in
overseas countries.
Production per acre has risen from
three tons of sugar to over four during
the past ten years. All research is done
by our own organisation, The Bureau
of Sugar Experiment Station, which is
completely financed by the industry
itself. Greater efficiency is attained by
using our own bureau than if we used
a Government body such as the CSIRO.
The price of sugar to the Australian
consumer has increased at a far lesser
rate than the cost of living. The quality
of Australian sugar has been such that
a ready market was available for all
sugar produced, even though exports
have more than doubled since 1963.
During the various inquiries by the
Government into the sugar industry,
never has the industry been accused of
being inefficient.
Never has the Government directly
subsidised the sugar industry. All money
made available to the industry has been
by way of a loan, which bears interest
and which has to be repaid. The
amount lent to the industry last year
was in the vicinity of $5 million.
If, as the article suggests, sugar land
should be turned to cattle, this would
decimate the population along the
Queensland coast, causing a greater
influx of people to the cities, and even
a country bumpkin belonging to a “dud
industry” knows that it costs ten times
as much to provide services to a person
in the city as to the person in the
country.
