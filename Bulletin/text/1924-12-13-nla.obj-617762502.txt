WHEN the September breeze
Sweeps fresh cold from the seas.
And the sky's a blue feather.
Worn by the ruffling weather,
I see them come with their rhymes,
Singers of other times.
See them loiter and stand
With a song in the hand;
With a dream, maybe, in the eyes
Of a dawn that must rise,
When the rod shall blossom, not nay,
And the poorest dog have his day.
A chuckle lives in the note
From this merry man’s throat;
An epigram here has birth
’Flint. Puck-like, circles the earth;
A dryad with brown hair
Keeps step with me on the stair.
Dust gilded by the sun
Is all they see who run;
But if von pause for dreams
You’ll feel the life that teems
About the time-worn ways,
And hear the roundelays.
When the September breeze
Sweeps fresh cold from the seas.
And the sky’s a blue feather,
Worn by the ruffling weather.
Though dead they are not mute,
I know, who hear their lute.

NORA McAULIFFE.
Among the Immortals
When a man is asleep he is dead, and
when he dreams he is in the Next \\ or Id. Once
in his life, which is often enough for any
practical purpose, he remains in the Next
World. Then, I suppose, he begins to shake
down and become acquainted. The Next
World is a place which requires some study.
Presumably it improves when one knows it
better, and learns the rub's. If it doesn t. it
is hardly worth while being dead.
The first impression is one of ill-fitting doors,
and precipices, and shadows and loose shut-
ters. The rest of the space is mostly devoted
to silly trick apparatus. That is to say, it
leaves the impression of being silly, tricky
and purposeless on the mind of the amateur
ghost who is just staying a second or two.
When he becomes a professional ghost and is
apprenticed to the apparatus (and to the
architecture, which is still worse), he may
find that a profound reasonableness pervades
the whole caboodle. The freak which looks
like a hybrid between a mangy monument and
a muddled mangle may even prove to be a
loom for the weaving of silken poems, when
the proper eye views it from the proper angle.
The Globe After This is much given to angles
of all the sorts we know and of other sorts,
and they are of more shapes, colors and
sounds than one can ever count when he
has just left his bed and dropped up. A
peculiarity which strikes every visitor is
that the roar of this other place is a silent
roar, however loud it may be. The visitor
himself, no matter how violently he may ex-
press rage and disapproval, only makes an
audible remark when he is back at home. And
his grievance becomes so intangible almost
immediately that he has hardly even the
satisfaction of saying that he will look into
tlie matter when he is dead, and call some-
body to account.
The Next World revolves on its axis at
various speeds, with the result that the
caller seldom enters twice by the same door
(the place, as already remarked, is well
furnished with doors) and finds himself twice
in the same bashed-looking apartment, or in
the same company, even though he may
make a habit of calling at the same hour.
Of course the World may really not be
“Next” at all, only next but ten, the
intermediate nine having been omitted but
still there; or, on the other hand, it may be
a previous world, which has been cleaned
and dyed and made fit for use again. If
there is a discrepancy in the matter of pace,
and the previous state is overtaking this
present state, or this one is overtaking the
subsequent one, a collision seems the most
natural thing to expect. To revert to the
matter of the company one meets while
sampling the future, it is remarkable that it
is mostly male. Possibly, as visitors who
arrive by the vehicle of sleep mostly come
by night, the ghost ladies are iii bed.
The dead strike me as an inhospitable lot.
Refreshments of a sketchy and insufficient
sort are of tern seen passing, as it were, but
they lack staying power. The place appears
to be mostly indoors; at least, the average
visionary can generally count from three to
ten indoor visions for one of the outdoor
sort. I suppose there are many storeys to
the institution, for there are many incline
!anes which presumably lead to somewhere,
ut there are few stairs, and such as there

riend has either left or disintegrated. He
as gone without going, so sudden is tlie
oneness. But the visitor finds progression
s a struggle with mists and myths anil
ummy mysteries. There isn t even that
efiniteness about the rule of the road which
s said to have prevailed in old F ranee after
he break-up of Charlemagne’s empire, when
t is recorded that there had ceased to be
my road, but when three men met two on a
middy track they killed the two. That was
'iolent but tangible. The deserted traveller
n the Other World is seldom greeted with
uolence. He merely finds himself on an
ipgrade, tangled in an atmosphere like soup,
md opposed by hostile and invisible fluff
viiicli accumulates round Ins legs till pro-
gress ends. „ . . ,
A great deal of work —even feverish work
it times —goes on, but no one ever sees a job
•oherentlv finished and the result spread out
’or inspection. Probably the owners are
jealous of tlieir trade secrets. The nearest
[ ever thought I got to a definite develop-
ment was this. I found myself in an immense
red hall, with 1(i small red halls opening off
it. 1 was making overtures to something
tliat 1 know by instinct to have been a Car-
thaginian executioner, when a man with
nothing on crossed the floor Mt a pace which
would have put Time back and won last
year’s Melbourne Cup. He hadn’t even his
skin oh, but was dragging it behind him at
the end of a rope. He carried Ins eyes on a
plate in his outstretched hand. By the
motion of his jaws I understood that he was
saving something about liow he helped .Julius
Cmsar to celebrate Christmas in the lower
of London. I turned to the Carthaginian
executioner to ask a question, but he was
goho. I ran after the skinless man with
the plate and the eyes, but he was gone.
When I got back I was gone myself. I only
mention this because, if it was the object of
the swift runner to get undressed, he had
attended to his business bettor than most of
his contemporaries. He took off everything,
including himself.
The Carthaginian executioner was a type.
Everybody is more or less like him. No
immortal ghost lady makes the glad eye at a
stranger, and invites him to stay with a view
to matrimony, and just let his clay envelope
take its chance at the boarding-house where
lie left it. No sociable ghost gentleman
invites him to drop in again next time he is
feeling disturbed after a heavy supper and a
beer and an aspirin. Nobody sees him to
the gate, and tells him of the best road back
to his old address, and waves a friendly
umbrella at parting. I suppose they are too
busy being immortal to have time for the
amenities of life, for they don’t even show
signs of being reasonably civil to one
another.
JAMES EDMOND.
A Book Exchange
I There is a word I have met often of late
that seems very applicable to Mr. Mink in-
itiation to his handling of the library.
“Flair.” Although I could not define ‘ flair
with exactitude. I can see Mink has it—-a
flair for managing his public. Or has Mr
Mink’s public a flair for being managed?
It is a fine question.
I think this flair of Mink’s for running
a book exchange must have been the gift
of some whimsical magician bending oyer
his cradle at birth. There is no accounting
for it else, for Mink is a little man of enor-
mous ignorance and foolish self-esteem where
Literature is concerned. He became a
librarian, he tells me, through buying a
“Fancy Goods” with the Book Exchange
thrown in, and at first he regarded it as “a
bit of a noosanee.” But he feels more toler-
ant now, as his subscribers’ list is fairly
heavy, and some there are, voracious read-
ers, who average two books' a day. “That’s
a deener a day,” calculates Mink. “A deener
a day is three bob a week. Twelve custom-
ers at three bob—thirty-six bob. Why—pay
the rent, that would! It ain’t so bad. after
all —the ole library ain’t so bad.” Unfor-
tunately this is mostly mirage, for the two-
book-a-day men are few. Mink is counting
his chickens too soon.
Despite his illiteracy Mink is wonderfully
popular with his patrons, many of whom,
instinctively recognising the flair before men-
tioned, rely upon his guidance along the
literary path. He chooses their reading by
request, for. though a person may know his
own taste in neckties, his taste m fiction
is a riddle not to be solved by himself.
This is where Mink comes in. Any day fie
is to be heard displaying ignorance, patron-
age real helpfulness and superhuman patience
with these dolts. Or they may not be dolts
so much as “gropers' —people, women chiefly,
who were pitchforked from school to fac-
tory and who now. years afterward, find
themselves with yearnings which they can-
not classify or direct. Mere infants these in
a maze of fiction. Ofttimes they will drift
around taking book after book from the
shelves and putting them back again.
Such a one is in now, a lymphatic woman
with a distressed look. Mink takes her m
I and He must be either short-sighted or
liable to read correctly. Ilow else can Ins
langling of authors and titles be explained
ince he makes the most astounding blund-
rs with the utmost sang-froid? •
“What sort of book d'you like? hove
arns?” he gabbles. “Or would you rather
ave adventure, detective, travel and so
orth’ Here’s a goo’ book, now, by Zane
jay. " Then there’s Deck Beach. An’ Booth
’arkinson, an’ lots more. I think you d like
Ms one.” He proffers it with commentary.
Tlia’s a goo’ book, now. ‘She Trusted Im
-one of Ethel Bossh’s. Ethel Bossh’s books
s all good. Love yarns. Tli’ real stuff an’
ill that. You take that one; it’ll suit you.
“But it’s for him,” she objects, and
"“Don’t like love yarns,” Mink interjects.
‘Well, here’s the very book. Real man s
100 k. ‘The. .. . something-or-other Race’ —
ie peers short-sightedly—by ‘Medicus. There s
i word missing in the title. Some careless
icrson has muterlated it. But it s a goo
look. Sporting.”
She takes the tome and is conscientiously
Tying to make into a racecourse the diagram
if the human interior which serves as its
frontispiece. Here Mink’s flair again comes
to the rescue. He realises that he has made
a mistake. “Lemme see,” In l says, authori-
tatively taking the book back. “ll’m, no—
that mightn’t suit him, after all. Have tins
one instead.”
The lymphatic one departs with Bonn to
Win,’ by Goul’,” which he lias thrust upon
her, and “The Human Race,” by “Medicus,”
goes back to its dust.
A woman wheeling a pram comes next.
Slipshod, her face scared by life, she list-
lessly handles the introspective works, out-
back stoi-ies and Yankee “screams” that are
side by side on the shelves until Mink comes
to the rescue with “One Week of Love.”
Then behold! She becomes soft, dreamy,
faintly illuminated by the ghosts of bygone
illusions. Allowing the baby in the pram
to rifle her handbag and pitch away the
onions, she loses herself in the description
of Yvonne’s agony during that one harrow-
ing week.
“If it’s a book for yourself.” advises Mink,
“you can’t do better than take ‘One Week
o’ Love’—it's a goo’ book for them as likes
a real love yarn.”
“Yes,” she gays; “give me, love tales every
time. The last one you gimme was good,
too —‘Led by a Girl.’ ”
■Mink introduces some moralising over this,
and such sentences as “A good woman’s in-
flooence,” “A man mus’ be led, not drove,”
seem to prove that the speaker has a flair
for humbug as well as literature.
In comes a mother in search of boys’ books.
Mink proffers a full knowledge of all the rub-
bish printed in this class —most of them
supposed to describe life in English boarding-
schools. Mink has read them all, lie says,
and if he has he deserves the martyr’s
crown. But more likely he has read just
one, and, as these school stories resemble
one another as closely as the egg of yester-
day resembles the egg of to-day, he can
vouch for all.
“An’ then there’s detective yarns, an’ cow-
boy yarns, an’ fightin’ yarns. xVll much of a
muchness. No. Got no Orstralian books
I for boys. In fact, there’s nothin’ doin’ in
Orstralian talent —tli’ country ain’t old
enough to perdooce much. Look at Dyson,
Dennis, Rudd, Banjo Pattinson an’ that
bunch. Read their perduetions, an’ whort’s
in any of ’em? Nothing.”
As this mother hails from the smokes of
Manchester she does not refute this libel on
Australia, but agrees with Mink that the land
of her adoption is but a literary chrysalis,
and departs triumphantly with “The Village
I-lero,” by A. Squire.
Then comes a reader who knows her own
mind. She demands “The Sheik.”
“‘The Sheik’?” says Mink. “Now you’re
talkin’, lie’s out —sawry. But ‘The Sheik’s’
booked six deep. He’s no sooner in than
lie’s out. Won’erf’ly pop’lar. Funny thing,”
he continues, “ ’ow they all love love, speci-
ally if Cupid’s a foreigner. Mus’ be a sort
of ’ankering. This bunch o’ kids cornin’ in
now’—it’s ten to nothing they’re love-chasers,
too.”
He is right. The leading lady is looking
for a love story with a girl on the cover,
and beginning, “The woman defies” She
remembers no more. What the woman defies
has us all guessing. Does she defy death —
duns —old age? Or is it the income-tax and
surfing regulations? We cannot say. Mink
gives Woman in many roles, such as “Woman
Pays,” “Woman’s Trust,” “Bondwoman” and
“Woman in the Home,” but all to no pur-
pose. He reviles his ill-luck in the loss of
some recent books. “Always the way,” he
mourns. “Boun’ to be marked absent when
wanted.”
Meanwhile the flappers overhaul his
shelves.
“Is this it?” demands one, pouncing upon
a copy of a book that was popular 40 years
ago-—“ The Woman in White.”
The girls flutter it over, pluck at its vitals,
absorb its “Finis.” They are not favorably
impressed—are pretty sure it is not the
wanted book. Still, there is a woman on
the cover; and Mr. Mink, always so oblig-
ing, assures them that it’s “a goo’ book, an'
much the same as ‘The Sheik’ and others
of that ilk—a love yarn.”
Just then one of the maidens remembers
a love story recently read in which —and
here she whispers to greedy ears. Giggles.
Delighted thrills. Delicious shudderings.
The flappers, drawn by burning curiosity,
Indense ecstatically, disintegrate unwill-
gly, condense again with yearnings.
“And you think this is something like it?”
ks she who holds “The Woman in
bite” of the narrator of past lurid reading.
Chen I’ll take it,” she says with finality.
I remark afterwards on the differences be-
reen Wilkie Collins and some present-day
ithors of “love” stories.
But Mink is “not worrying.” “Funny
ing, though, the way women choose books,
how a book with a ‘skirt’ on the cover
1’ they cotton to it instanter. An’ all this
ush ! " Y’can see fer yerself ’ow they rush
[ucklieap’s books, specially if there’s a few
isty illustrations. An’ keep ’em out over th’
irtiiight— too right they do. Oh, l know—
aning ’em round among tlieir mates.’ Ad’
mt don’t pay. Why, some days it’s most
nnoyin’. Find all me pop’lar books gorn
nt, an’ nothin’ paid on’ em. You know —
inched, French leave. Sneaked away in
lot-cases an’ kimona pockets w’en I’m
hort-’anded an’ too busy to watch ’em. Oh,
know ’em ! An’ when they do return ’em
-whort is it? All the pop’lar bits tore out.
J 1 the ’ot bits. Yes, all gorn. Tore out.
lissing at Lloyds, as the sayin’ is. An’. I
rsk yon, what is a sloppy book without its
lop? Why. it’s tli’ sloppy book that’s the
courge of England’s greatness.”
He is heard again soon after talking in
craps to an old lady of antediluvian cut and
rent gullibility who has just ambled in.
What! You didn’ care for the last one I
licked for you?”
Old Lady: “Not so much, after all.”
Mink: “No? An’ yet lie’s a good
mthor. Why didn’t he suit?”
Lady : “I don’t know. It made me sleepy. ’
Mink: “Ah! A bit ’eavy, pnrraps. You
vant something more rousing, flow'd yon
ike this—jus’ brought back by a lady wol
mows a goo’ book?”
Lady (picking up a loose book and rend-
ng title) : “ ‘Tess of the’ ”
Mink (firmly) : “No, I wouldn’t advise
t. That’s a book I call —well, I call it—
>r —a squiffy book.”
Lady: “What do you mean by squiffy,
iwaetly, Mr. Mink?”
Mink: “Squiffy? Well, I mean it’s not
l b’
Lady (gratefully): “Oh, thank you; we
must always keep the home pure; and if not
in our literature, then where? Give me some-
thing else, Mr. Mink —I rely, entirely upon
yon.”
Mink: “You can’t do better than this one
of Charles Garvice’s —or, better still, ’ere’s
‘The Bandit’s Bride.’ I can recommend that
—a love yarn. You’ll like it—a goo’ book;
goo’ moral tone.”
“Won’erful thing, love,” ruminates Mink
as the lady departs with all sail set. “Wou-
’crful what a ninterest th’ women take in it."
“They must have a flair for it,” I suggest.
“Flair? Wot’s that?” asks Mink.
WEEROONA.
The Poor Shepherd
My thoughts are mine to hold and mine to
lose.
They are a wandering flock of silly sheep
That scatter all about and will not keep
The white, ascending ways and paths I
choose;
But, breaking from the mountain’s misty
blues,
Where stark and lone stares each untrampled
steep,
They wander down to lands as soft as sleep.
Their careless feet among the valley dews.
A singing shepherd with his flock am I;
Yet fearful lest sometime I’ll wearied be
Of urging these slow sheep through pathways
high
To places where the lonely stars have birth !
Oh, shall I never rest, content to see
Them feed in crowded pastures near the
earth!

FARMING has been extensively adopted in
nearly every part of the world, and Australia is at last
beginning to realise that it is the only effective method of
reducing production costs on the land. There is probably
no power-farming machinery that has achieved so great a
measure of success for farmers in Australia as
Kerosene Farm & General PurposeTracfor
Consequently it is with pardonable pride that the Directors
of Commonwealth Agricultural Service Engineers, Limited,
point to the rapid growth of their Company's industry since
its inception four years ago.
Realising the advantages of cheaper farm power, three engineers
founded Technical Engineers, Limited, in 1920, a small general
engineering concern in Adelaide, and imported two CASE
Kerosene Tractors.
After submitting these to various tests during eight months over
the main farming areas of South Australia, it was found that
the Tractors had performed their work in such a satisfactory
manner that it was decided to approach the J. I. Case Threshing
Machine Company, of America, with a proposition for handling
the Case Company's goods in Australia by floating a separate
company. This was agreed to, and the Company —with a
nominal capital of 100,000 £1 shares —was registered on August
16th, 1921. The Company has since considerably increased
its working capital, and under the contract with the J. I. Case
Threshing Machine Company, it now has branches in every
State of the Commonwealth except Tasmania. Each of these
branches is staffed and controlled by men who are experts in
the Machinery Trade, and who have specialised in its relation
to farming activities. The workshops of the Company are
absolutely self-contained, and able to manufacture any number
of spare parts to maintain an efficient service throughout
Australia. The volume of business of the Company has
increased tremendously during the past twelve months, and
the orders received for CASE Tractors alone runs into many
hundreds from all parts of the Commonwealth. Probably no
other firm in Australia handling similar articles could produce
evidence of such remarkable and rapid growth.
The Company holds freehold in several towns, and the monthly
shipment of Case machinery from factory to Australia necessi-
tates a special train to convey it from Racine to the seaboard.
The superiority of the Case Tractor as a power farming im-
plement is abundantly borne out by the testimony of satisfied
users.

The Carol.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
t4 \ 11 T ELL, if you ask me, Brummell,”
\A/ said Ensign Patrick Calder, of
* V H.M. 46th Regiment of Foot—
“if you ask me, I’m bound to say that I con-
sider the notion a d—d poor one. I do,
really. What’s your idea of it, Pansy?”
Lieutenant Gregory Wicks, R.N., of
H.M.S. Emu, took a deep draught of Mr.
Squire’s famous beer out of an earthenware
jug standing on the stained table in front
of him—they were seated in the back parlor
of Timothy Naylan’s Spotted Dog Inn in
George-street, Sydney, and it was a late and
warm December afternoon. He seemed to
consider his reply carefully.
“Well, you see, Patsy, ’tis perfectly cor-
rect what Brummell says —this is an uncouth
kind of place, most uncouth, and needs some
sort of refining touch. Whether we are
exactly the kind of people to effect an im-
provement in this respect I dunno, but I
doubt it. However, Brum thinks we are—
and, Lord, we may be, we may be! God
bless my soul, I’ve heard a Portsmouth doxy
almost reduce a taproom o’ tarpaulins to
tears a-singing ‘Annie Laurie.’ So, perhaps,
if we were to go round a-bellowing ‘Come,
All Ye Faithful,’ ‘When Shepherds Watched’
and ‘Good King Wenceslas’ —why, damme,
we might effect some improvement in the
moral tone of Sydney at Christmas-time.
What’d you propose to do with the collec-
tion, Brum?”
Mr. Acting-Deputy-Assistant-Commissary-
General Pilkington, known to his inti-
mates as Brummell, inclined his head in
stately approval of his naval friend's senti-
ments, regarded the soldier with lofty super-
ciliousness. took a pull at his own brown
jug and wiped his lips elegantly with a lace
handkerchief.
“Patthy,” he said, “you are an ecthecwable
dolt—that ith to a dam’ fool. It
gwatifieth me to tlieq that Panthy here ith
endowed with better thenthe and a better
thpiwit. What’th w’ong with the notion,
pway? Here we are, twelve tliouthand mileth
fwom home, on the outthide of the world, in
a wetched platlie without mannerth or mor-
wality, and inhabited for the motht part by
barbarwiantli and ignorwamutheth. Ith it
out of all weathon to endeavor to uplift our
fellow-men fwom the tlilough of debathement
and degwedation into which thircum-
thtantheth have weduthed them? Are we to
thtand idly by and thee them thpend the
fethtive theathon which commemorwateth the
birth of our Thaviour in dwunkenneth and
debauchery? No—ten thouthan’ timetli no!”
Mr. Wicks banged his empty jug several
times upon the table, partly as an indica-
tion of his approval of these altruistic senti-
ments, partly as a summons to the landlord.
The latter shoved his red head into the room
from the adjacfent public bar.
“Fill ’em up again, Tim,” shouted Mr.
Wicks enthusiastically. “Brummell, you
carry the meeting with you. Of course, we’ll
have carols. It has never been done before
in the colony, I’ll go bail. And the lobster
will join in, too—won’t you, Patrick? A
d—d good idea, I call it.”
“Oh, I suppose so,” grumbled Mr. Calder.
“But who’s going to do the singing? I
wasn’t aware that any of us could warble
to any extent. Wlio’re you going to get to
do the singing?”
“Quite tlio, Patwick,” said Mr. Pilking-
ton, condescendingly. “I am glad to find
you amenable to weathon, and pwepared to
ditlicuth thitli important matter in a wight
thpiwit. Good! But ath you vewy aptly
obtherve, neither you nor Panthy here nor
mythelf are what might pwoperly be
dethcwibed ath thongtliterth or tuneful
birdth. We mutlit organithe a band of
Waitth. Now, I have in my offitlie a con-
vict clerk, Bill Watford —you know the
crotli-eycd little runt —who’th vewy muthical.
Tliingth like a nightingale, tlio help me. And
I’ve no doubt there are one or two tholdierth
in your company, Patwick, who may be
obtained. Have you not thome people of
talent in the Emu, Panthy? There thould
be thome amongtht your theamen who can
thing.”
“By gad, yes, Brum, there are! The cap-
tain of the maintop, Ben Sisson, can beef it
out like a bull —and there’s one or two
others. Oh, by George, we’ll be able to get
’em right enough. But what would you
think of turning ’em loose with, Brummell?
I mean, what’ll they sing?”
“Oh, the uthual Cwithmath thtuff, I thup-
pothe. But, by Jove, how’d it do to get
Michael Wobinthon to compothe thomething
thpethial for the occathion? He’tli a poet
of no mean order, our Mithter Wobinthon.
I’ve got the ode he made when Mrs. Putland
married Colonel O’Connell—here ’tith, in my
pocket-book. The geniuth who could wite
that could eathily do utli a cawol. I’ll athk
him. Here you are, Panthy—wead out the
thtanthath I’ve marked. I am not an elocu-
tionitht, ath you may have notithed. Wead
’em, my boy—and you tliit and lithten,
Patthy. Dam’ noble lineth, I call ’em.” *
Mr. Wicks took the folded paper which
Mr. Pilkington extracted from his silver-
mounted Morocco-leather pocket-book, and
read verses by the semi-official laureate of
Macquarie’s reign—Mr. Michael Robinson,
chief clerk in Mr. Secretary Campbell's office,
and also of the High Court of Appeals. They
began :
Strike, loudly strike the lyric ring;
To Bridal Love devote the song,
Let every muse a garland bring.
And Joy the festive note prolong !
Mr. Michael Robinson has been neglect-
fully treated by posterity. But he was not
neglected in 1817. To see him as he sat in
Mr. Calder’s quarters at the Barracks, read-
ing aloud to a breathless audience composed
of the three officers and certain musical sub-
ordinates of their respective services, was to
recognise that genius had its place in early
Sydney. It was also to be recognised that
genius, in the person of Mr. Michael Robin-
son, was fully appreciative of the homage
that his present audience accorded him —not
greatly flattered by it, but graciously recep-
tive of it, as something due to him of right
and justice.
He sat at the round table in the middle
of the big barrack-room, a glass of rum
adjacent to his right hand, and a paper in
his left from which he read with much feel-
ing the Christmas carol which he had com-
posed at the request of the three impresarios,
Messrs. Pilkington, Calder and Wicks, who
sat in a row upon Mr. Calder's bed. They
held glasses of rum, too. Ranged against the
wall, uneasily at attention, was another row
of soldiers, sailors and civilians of a humbler
class —the little band of Waits selected by
Mr. Pilkington to be instruments in the up-
lift of the community during the approach-
ing Christmastide. In their sunburnt hands
were also retained some payment on account
in the liquid medium of exchange with which
their services were to be rewarded.
Amidst a deep and gratifying silence, Mr.
Robinson read his carol.
“ "Tis entitled, gentlemen,” he said, “ ‘Hail,
Nobler Herod,’ since I have composed it with
the idea that ’tis to be sung outside Govern-
ment House at midnight, especially for the
benefit of his Excellency. There can be no
doubt that a considerable audience, consist-
ing of all classes of the community, will by
that time have collected as a following of
these masters of vocalisation whom I see
before me—but ’tis intended primarily for
Mr. Macquarie’s ear. That, I think, you
will agree, gentlemen, is but proper.”
“Oh, yes,” grumbled Mr. Calder —“let's
soap the old devil up. He likes it.”
“Be quiet, Patwick,” commanded Mr. Pil-
kington. “Pway, pwotheed. Mitliter Wobin-
thon. We are all wapt attention.”
Mr. Robinson proceeded. Standing up,
he read the following lines with appropriate
gesture and declamation. When the Gover-
nor was mentioned he bowed his head, as do
the devout when Christ’s name occurs in the
recital of the Apostles’ Creed. A shaft of
sunlight, shining through one of the room’s
two tall windows, very fittingly illuminated
the poet’s person :
“Great George’s regent,
Puissant son of Mars,
Ope now thy casement
To the twinkling stars;
Let Melody and Rev’rence thrill the night,
The soul enrapture, and the ear delight!
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE PUT UP WITH HIS NONSENSE.
“Beastly nuisance, dear —the manager's making an awful fuss about our overdraft again.”
Well, I wonder you stand it, George —l’d have taken it to another bank long ago.”
At the end of the verses, gentlemen, our
tuneful friends join in the chorus to the
words which Mr. Benjamin Sisson will have
so feelingly warbled, doubtless to the en-
thralment of our noble Governor.”
Mr. Robinson refreshed himself, whilst the
others raised their glasses in humble tribute
to his genius. With an eloquent downward
gesture of his right arm, he exclaimed —not
without an inflection of justifiable jiride in
his voice:
“Chorus—
Th’ sacred morn, th’ holy day draws nigh,
Bethl’em’s bright star shineS plain to ev’rv eye.
Sing, sing, ye birds —ope, ope, ye buds and flow’rs —-
Raise paeans of praise throughout th’ enchanted hours !
The final verse, gentlemen—brevity com-
mends itself, and is most eloquent, upon such
an occasion.
Hail, nobler Herod,
Bid now all discord cease;
Be thou our guide,
As erst the Prince of Peace.
Oh, Great Macquarie, on Austral’s sunny shore
Preach love, goodwill, and joy for evermore.”
The composer bowed to the gentlemen and
to the musicians, laid the verses on the table
and sat down. Murmurs of appreciation
filled the room —articulate from the three
on the bed, expressed by grunts, gulping of
rum and uneasy shuffling of feet by the
Waits.
“Oh, I thay, Mitliter Wobinson —you are
inimitable!” Mr. Pilkington advanced to
clasp the poet’s hand.
“Dam’ fine!” admiringly exclaimed Mr.
Wicks.
“Very good indeed,” admitted Mr. Calder
—“even if it does crack Old Solemnity up a
bit more than’s required. How about the
music? Have you arranged that with the
bandmaster? I told him to go see you at
your house, as you requested, Mr. Robinson.”
“Yes, thank you, Mr. Calder. Mr. Hall
has set these —ah —trifling fancies to a very
captivating air. adapted for the bassoon, the
clarinet and the fiddle, and has provided
three performers from his highly select organ-
isation to accompany our carollers. This
afternoon, with your permission, I’ve ar-
ranged that we shall all proceed to a secluded
spot at the head of Cockle Bay—the duel-
ling-gound, to be exact—there to practise
with musical accompaniment the whole of
our repertoire. And, particularly, my own
modest effort. We have but a week in which
to render ourselves perfect, and I would beg
to remind you, gentlemen, that perfection
is a sine qua non —a nothing without which.
We must take care not to offend, when we
hope to entertain, his Excellency. But we’ll
not fail the occasion. No, indeed! ’Tis too
auspicious a one to be subject to any contrc-
temps against which assiduity in rendering
ourselves letter- and note-perfect may guard.
Let us set forth, then, gentlemen, for the
sylvan glade, where, undisturbed by the vul-
gar brawl of everyday life in this busy metro-
polis of our beloved country, we may sound
the tintinnabulating lyre, invoke the Muse of
Harmony, and propitiate the Gods of
Chance.”
"My Gawd!” whispered Mr. Wicks to Mr.
Calder as they went out. “our Mike's the
flowery one, ain't he! What th’ devil's a
tintinnabulating liar, Patsy? Not the sort
you are, by any chance?”
* * * *
The Christmas Eve of 1817 was a most
serene and beautiful one in Sydney. The
night was warm and still, and a full moon
hung like a great round lamp over the dark
roofs and gables of Government House and
the treetops that lined the eastern side of
Macquarie-street behind it. Sydney Cove
sparkled in its radiance, and, between its
dark, wooded shores, Port Jackson stretched
a carpet of burnished steel from Cockatoo
Island to Watson’s Bay. About 11.30 p.m.
the Waits staggered over the bridge across
the Tank Stream, exhilarated by the appre-
ciation of their efforts which had been
universally accorded by Sydney’s grateful
citizens, stimulated to a deep and virtuous
enthusiasm, and resolved to make the grand
finale of their joyous labors a thing to be
remembered in the aftertime.
It was, for many a long day.
Through the little town the devoted and
melodious band had made gentle music
throughout the evening. “Adcste Fideles,”
“When Shepherds Watched,” “King Wen-
ceslas” —most of the ancient and beloved
carols that take Englishmen back to England
from all her wide and far-flung outposts on
the eve of Christianity’s blessed and kindly
festival, had made their singing a precious
thing to all who heard it that summer night,
one hundred and seven years ago, in little,
exiled Sydney. Even the native-born, the
Currency Lads and Lasses, who knew not
the look of dark hedges bordering snow-filled
lanes, of white roofs in the moonlight, of
roaring Yuletide fires beneath big mantel-
shelves, of all that most meant Christmas to
their parents —even they caught the infection
of piety and good cheer and reconciliation
with all the world that emanates from those
old happily-worded tunes. The Waits had
been an unqualified and notable success—but
by half-past 11 they were not the Waits they
were.
At the Mess their efforts had met with
the liveliest appreciation and much steaming
punch, carried out to them by Colonel Molle
and his officers. Every public-house in
George and Pitt streets, Castlereagh and
King, and down by Sydney Cove, had filled
them with colonial beer and rum. Mr. Simeon
Lord had emerged from the front door of his
great house by Macquarie-place with a dozen
bottles of heady port. Mrs. Reibey, that
motherly merchant and fine woman, had in-
sisted upon entertaining them within doors.
Nothing could have been more gratifying to
Messrs. Robinson, Pilkington, Calder and
Wicks than the whole-hearted appreciation
bestowed upon them by their fellow-colonists.
They were, figuratively, intoxicated with suc-
cess—literally, with as complete a mixture
of strong watei’s as the stomach and
brain of man has ever valiantly con-
tended with.
“Brummell, old lad,” hiccupped Mr. Wicks
as they lurched across the bridge. “I don’
somehow think ’twould be —hie —a’vishable
lerrer insterment’lists perform Gov’men’
House. Sozzled, sprung, three sheets in er
wind—that’sh —hie —what they are. Wot-
yer say, old Brum? Make Ben Sisson sing
Mis’r Rob’son’s carol solus. Safer, I think.
’Pon my soul, I do.”
“Egad, Pansy, I think you’re right. Latlit
performanth wath a little micthed, to thay
th’ leatht. The bathoon-player gave ’em
‘Heartth of Oak,’ whiltht the fiddler wath
playing ‘Thweetheartth and Wiveth,’ and I
think the clarinet wath trying to get out
‘Twafalgah Bay.’ Yeth, we’ll conthult
Mitliter Wobinthon. No uthe athkin Pat
Calder —that wepwobate’th ath dwunk ath
Chloe.”
So, in the garden of Government House,
its following crowd of admirers held without
the gates by the guard, the Waits formed
an unsteady line, swaying in the moonlight,
as his Excellency, accompanied by Mrs.
Macquarie and Mr. John Thomas Campbell,
the secretary, stepped out on to the verandah
from . the brightly-lighted drawing-room of
the big cottage. Mr. Robinson gave the word
to. begin, beating time with his walking-
stick, while the undulating captain of the
maintop of H.M.S. Emu braced himself for
his supremest effort.
And then, at the top of a remarkable bari-
tone voice, Mr. Ben Sisson burst forth in
the still night, so that his tremendous notes
echoed across the valley to the Rocks, and
sang with great gusto, not “Hail, Nobler
Herod,” but that exceedingly ribald, blas-
phemous and obscene classic of the fighting
services of Great Britain, “Sammy Hall”!
It is, as all who have had to do with Navy
or Army know, a very ancient ballad. Many
of its characteristics are shared by that
famous lyric of the A.1.F., “Mademoiselle
from Armenti&res.” Both in their unex-
purgated editions are songs more suited for
the bivouac and the fo’c’s’le than the vice-
regal drawing-room. Both have been, and
are, extremely popular amongst British and
Australian fighting-men. Both are, in the
vernacular, the Y T ery Limit.
“My dear, my dear Elizabeth, pray go
inside. Go to the kitchens. You must not
listen to this!”
Dutifully but regretfully, Mrs. Macquarie
retired, whilst the Governor and Mr. Camp-
bell stood as if rooted with astonishment
to the verandah. Mr. Robinson, Mr. Pilking-
ton, Mr. Calder and Mr. Wicks were para-
lysed with amazing fear. The crowd without
the gates gaped in wonderment. Ben Sis-
son roared his ribaldry without bashfulness,
with supreme confidence and with no expur-
gations.
“My name is Sammy Hall,
D —n your eyes.
I’ve only g0t”....
roared the lusty seaman, whilst all Sydney
gave ear to the terrible words, set to an in-
spiriting air of recklessness which gives it
charm, roared in the tuneful voice of a
musical bull.
“O my God!” groaned Mr. Wicks as the
final objurgatory phrase concluded. “What's
going to happen now!”
Mr. Calder was speechless. Mr. Robinson
wept. Mr. Pilkington murmured resignedly.
And then hap-
pened the miracle
of the evening.
The Governor
stepped to the
edge of th e
veran d a h, and
cleared his throat,
whilst all the little
wor 1 d wondered
and shivered. Dam-
nation scathing,
bitter, ruthless —
was what they
looked for. What
they got was this
stunning surprise.
“G e n 11 omen,”
said Macquarie,
“on behalf of my-
self and my wife, I
most heartily thank
you for your efforts
this evening to lead
our loving thoughts
back to those
scenes of Christmas
cheer and Christ-
mas pie t y from
which we are so
far removed in this
distant clime. With
great appreciation
we have listened
all the evening to
your rendering of
those delightful old-
time songs through-
out the town. You
deserve the thanks
of all the inhabi-
tants. For myself.
I am more than
grateful that you
have thought fit to
entertain me, as a soldier, with a
soldier’s song. The ballad of ‘Sammy
Hall’ may be lacking, perhaps, in re-
finement, but its associations sanctify it to
all who have served their country under arms.
I had never expected to hear it again. I
thank you heartily. Perhaps, gentlemen,
you will give me the pleasure and gratifica-
tion of offering you some refreshment. I
thank you—l thank you most heartily.”
“God’th gwathiouth merthy!” muttered
Mr. Pilkington.

The Glory-box.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SAYS she, “Eve got my glory-box—
My mantel-drape is made;
The top is all set out in clocks,
The centre’s filled with braid;
Tbe edge it is three deep in fringe,
Ye’d love to see it swing!”
But divvle a sheet and towel she had,
The poor ould thing!
Says she, “I’ve worked my fingers thin
With stitcliin’ round and round
To get the patheren fitted in
On that there yaller ground !”
Says she, “The greens they wouldn’t mix;
I thought me dash was done;
Rut I stuck to the work like glue,” says she,
“And in the end I won.”
She showed us d’oyleys by the score,
Ye’d think she’d never stop :
She showed us crewel mats galore,
Enough to stock a shop;
She showed us covered tins and jars,
And things ye made of string—
But never a sheet and towel she had,
The poor ould thing !
Says she, “I’ve worked for years and years
On that there glory-box!
I’ve had to pack the things in tiers
I’ve made such stocks and stocks ;
Seven teapot-cosies I’ve got there,
And stuff to make three more:
And many’s the night I’ve stitched so much
I made my fingers sore!”
She’d curly braid, and Vandyke braid,
And dressed-up knobs and pegs.
She’d woollen mats of every shade,
And cosies for the eggs;
She’d even a quilt of crochet work
With Cupids on the wing—-
But divvle a sheet and towel she had,
The poor ould thing!

MARY GILMORE


Kervick’s Wife.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PHINEAS P- KERVICK was, I believe,
a lover of animals— anyhow, he had
been married to three of them and
divorced from two. The details of his
divorces never reached me, partly because
our brief acquaintance was full of motion
and mild adventure. I found Phineas at
the mouldering old Scriptural town of
Jericho, beside the Dead Sea, in the summer
of 1914, a day after the beginning of the
Great AA 7 ar, but while Turkey was still
at peace. That is to say, there were petty
campaigns on one or two borders, and some
brigandage which constituted the aftermath
of a revolution, and there was a new 1 arlia-
meut, which was worse than any of them,
and the usual national insolvency; but, in
general, affairs were normal, and business
went on as usual. I was merely wandering.
Phineas P. Kervick represented a United
States company which had secured water
lights, or documents to that effect, m the
Jordan, where there is immense power, and
little chance of doing much good with it by
leason of pashas and other accumulative
characters. Even before the war began he
had come to the conclusion that the best
course would be to sell the concession, for
a large profit, in some goldarned European
country whjch was more favorably situated
for arguing with pashas. The outbreak of
hostilities, so the landlord told me, had made
him, for the time, a colorable imitation of
a raving lunatic, but he had degenerated into
gloom when I met him. Possibly the war
also tended to make him more confidential
than usual, for he certainly proved a chatty
soul. His immediate business, I assumed
from his line of inquiry, was to view the
property, and to gather local color for the
prospectus, along with a Biblical flavoring
which would appeal to the moneyed elect,
and make them take the Jordan Valley
Hydraulic Power Co. for a Christian enter-
prise. AVhat became of the venture I never
heard. Doubtless the great upheaval swal-
lowed it whole.
In the course of conversation I learned
that the third Mrs. Kervick had been the
widow of the managing director when she
married. I speculated as to whether she was
.likewise anybody clse’s widow or grass-
widow. As Kervick was fairly young de-
spite his matrimonial ventures, and was good
to look upon, I inferred that the lady was
older, and not in the beauty-show category.
(Kervick’s good looks were of the 8010
Pasha type.) Further, I inferred that his
marriage had brought him promotion, and
that he would have preferred the promotion
without the marriage. It was simply that
he was that sort of man. A further diag-
nosis was to the effect that he was rather
futile for an American of large affairs, but
that the lady had qualities which made good
the deficiency.
Mrs. Kervick was with her husband in
one sense, while in another she was not.
She had decided to avoid the dangers and
hardships to be encountered while inspect-
ing the Jordan back to its source, so she
had taken the sea route and was to meet
him at Damascus, where they would have
a new honeymoon. He had a lady secretary
with him at the hotel, but she was paid off
and lost early in the subsequent doings. I
never caught more than a glimpse of her
without a veil, but she was a blonde and
dazzling secretary.
Then, in the late afternoon of that first
day of our friendship, a telegram arrived
which showed that Mrs. Kervick was run-
ning up to time. It was from Damascus,
and said briefly:
“Wife at point of death. Hasten.”
“I believe there’s going to be a hoodoo
on this trin.” sighed Kervick. “I hate the
country. I don’t think the river’s any good.
I suppose this war’ll spoil everything. Why
couldn’t they leave their war for another
year? And now this!” He flicked the tele-
gram with his finger. “I must start in the
morning. You’re coming, of course? You’re
not by any chance going to stay longer in
this hole?”
Certainly I was coming, for the place
seemed too much like a prospective war-zone.
If I could reach Jaffa and retire into Egypt
as so many old Scriptural characters did,
it would be a desirable consummation. The
tented field was never among my dissipa-
tions. In fact, I wouldn’t have one as a
gift and build a brewery on it. The Croix
de Guerre which the Fates meant me to
wear can go to a nigger if he cares to be
at the trouble of earning it, and my front
reserved seat in the ranks of war is available
on the box-plan for the first applicant. But
while considering my own safety I had time
to feel rather sorry for the poor lady who
was dying all by herself in a semi-lieathen
town, even if she was, as I surmised, some
rich man’s “elderly, ugly daughter.”
There were no earmarks about the dash-
ing Kervick to tell me he was a Jonah. I
suppose Jonah himself looked the same as
any other prophet. Yet I believe I should
have known.
Three in the morning is the orthodox sum-
mer hour for leaving Jericho, at the bottom
of its stupendous hole, and beginning the
nine-hours’ ascent to the breezy uplands of
Jerusalem. The way has the AA 7 ilderness
of Judah on one side and the gorge where
Elijah w T as fed by ravens on the other. It
commands at one place a view of the Monas-
tery of St. George, which is hideously over-
crowded with journeyman-monks in black,
while apprentice-monks doss in adjacent
caves and wait for vacancies, and line up
regularly for their rations. St. George’s is
a blessed refuge for loafers who are none
too clean. The road also leads by the inn
where the Samaritan brought the traveller
who fell among thieves, two of whom hold
the license to this day. The next wayside
house is the one where the whole twelve
apostles stopped simultaneously for a drink.
They passed on and are gone now. Every-
thing passes in this changeful world. The
very last place of call was the pub habitu-
ally frequented by Lazarus between his two
deaths. Then we were at Jerusalem and
found it filled with an unwonted hum. The
Prophet was awake, and speculating on the
war, and wondering who was the smallest
and most affluent neighbor to hit.
Kervick looked more like 8010
than ever in the crisp morning air. His
companion sat veiled and silent all the way,
and was plainly taking no chances of iden-
tification. She di(\n’t encumber iis in the
Stof our wanderings, but vanished along
with Muley Hassan, the courier. At: Jeru-
salem my course was clear. I uas boon
for Jaffa, where all the worst characters
of Palestine hang out, and the first boat
for Egypt was my object. Kervick could
go north by the land route, or by sea from
Jaffa, and he chose the latter, so we went
a-Jonahing together. Probably all that hap-
pened would have happened just the same
without Kervick; still I believe lie had the
evil eye in a weak sort of way. Certainly
h<- had too many clothes. He got the address
of some legal or semi-official business people
av Damascus, and wired them to search the
two or three European hotels for Mrs. 1 at-
ricia Kervick or her remains, and telegraph
all possible news to Jaffa. And he specu-
lated aloud as to wlietherthe lady had made
her will “before she died.”
The Prophet was humming worse in the
morning, and there was an earthy note in
his voice—the voice of one embittered by
long burial. But at Jaffa, when he reached
it by the dinky little train, the sound was
still more pronounced. It amounted to a
positive roar at times. Somebody. said it
was only the wharf-laborers signifying that
they took an interest in politics. (They
got their name from the fact that there was
no wharf and that they didn’t labor to any
extent, but they worked cargo by boats and
THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL.
practised most of the known crimes except
those which required education.) But de-
spite the noise no disturbance of any sort
was in visible progress, and the house of
Simon the tanner, where St. Peter had his
vision of Assorted Animals, was on view
at the usual price. I took it for granted
that the figure would have been raised. if
any trouble was in the air. At Heinrich
Ilardegg’s hotel we found the landlord pale
but firm, and it didn’t occur to me, curiously
enough, to inquire what he was firm about.
The concern of most importance was that
two steamers were due next day—one each
way. Kervick got no reply to his message,
nor for that matter did he get one to various
subsequent messages; but, after all, it was
hardly reasonable to expect the Turk to hit
two wandering infidels accurately with tele-
grams in those days of stress. Probably
Abdul would have missed the Tower of Lon-
don with a postcard, and the Tower is a
staid and stationary structure. It was a
long, lagging day, and we felt that we were
growing tired of each other, with no litera-
ture and doubtful liquor.
But next day hadn’t time to be long. As
early as breakfast-time it began to put its
best foot foremost and do things. It was a
morning of ideal beauty, too, when the sea
was liquid azure, and the orange-groves might
have been newly spilled out of Paradise.
The furious blowing of a steamboat whistle
and a roar of execration brought us to the
window, and there Kervick saw his north-
bound boat leaving the bay almost before it
had entered. It had slowed down to an im-
perceptible pace ready to anchor when three
violent blasts were executed on the siren,
the engines were reversed hard, and the good
Austrian Lloyd craft Schuttenliofen pro-
ceeded to vanish up the coast like a spectre.
Heinrich Hardegg said that now the row had
started the wharf-laborers might go on in-
definitely. He looked pale and fat and un-
shaven in the garish light of day, and seemed
to see Business a corpse on the floor. Frau
Hardegg hadn’t appeared at all.
“Call that goshdarned hooker back!”
shouted Phineas P. Kervick in reasonless
frenzy. “Signal her or something.” He
actually thought in his haste that the low-
spirited hotelkeeper was responsible. Hard-
egg took no notice, but proceeded to explain
in a flat, monotonous voice that the wharf-
laborers merely wanted to kill Captain
AATnckler by way of a sort of Roman holi-
day. If he was no longer in command they
might possibly butcher his successor.
AAliether the disturbance was meant to
spread to the other officers and other ships
our host knew not, but until the trouble
blew over the Schuttenliofen was on the
black-list. Some of the malcontents, the
landlord added, were trying to overtake
AVinckler’s boat by swimming, and others
were running up the coast to head her off
at the next port. “Some doghound has told
them that the Sultan has declared war, and
that makes them wmrse than usual,” was the
final shadow on the narrative. On top of
all else, it was obvious that someone on
shore had warned off the badly-wanted skip-
per by signal, and that someone was already
being advertised for in the “Missing Friends”
column of the local weekly.
I .naturally inquired how such a mild and
peaceful man as a man with a name like
Winckler would necessarily be could have
aroused such animosity. AA 7 as he, for in-
stance, a non-unionist, or had he refused to
contribute to the Sinn Fein fund? It w T as
neither. But there was a great occasional
religious festival at Haifa, up the coast,
and all the pious brown ruffianism of the
shores attended. This included the wharf-
laborers of Jaffa, as a matter of course.
AA 7 hen the concourse had spent all its money
and worked itself up to a condition of fervor
it had an unfortunate habit of taking a free
passage home per steamer, and being im-
polite en route. The habit grew, and so did
the impoliteness. AAYnckler had been trans-
ferred from another branch of the service
to deal with the matter, his instructions
being somewhat to this effect: —
To endeavor, by firmness and diplomacy, to abate
an evil which is the cause of monetary loss to the
company, and of discomfort and even alarm to the
company’s passengers, and which further tends to
subvert discipline and bring the law into contempt.
Nothing could be clearer than these instruc-
tions. AVinckler was one of the biggest
rnen God took the trouble to make, and he
was an ex-naval person with no great opinion
of the civil population, especially if it was
brown, non-Christian and insolvent. Hav-
ing carefully assimilated the situation, he
got the less stalwart members of his crew
replaced with men after his own heart, and
when the hour came he proceeded to shove
his unfinancial pilgrims back head first into
the boats on which they came. These
methods combined shock tactics with the
advantage of surprise. AVhen the boats were
full he shoved the rest into the water and
Itft them swimming. The Turkish legal
authorities were placated without much diffi-
culty, but the A\ T aterside Workers’ Union
of Jaffa —a considerable part of which had
walked home —was not.
I was bound south by the Anglo-Egyptian
boat, so these complications were rather
amusing than otherwise to me. I told Ker-
vick and Heinrich Hardegg this, but all the
latter did was to point with a sad and mas-
sive hand at the window. Looking out I
descried the Anglo-Egyptian boat plodding
south without a sign of calling in. The
joint theory which we evolved was that
Winckler had signalled his confrere that
the Waterside Workers were in a black mood
and the other man, having only a sketchy
crew of Egyptians to depend on and pro-
bably having little business in view, thought
it not worth while to look into the hornet’s
nest on the chance of the animal being at
home.
Phineas P. Kervick remarked spitefully
that he regarded this new complication as
rather amusing than otherwise. Though we
were travelling companions by accident no
durable bond of brotherhood was growing up
between us. We were, in a manner of speak-
ing, ships that passed in the night, like the
two which had just passed and left us in
the lurch. Our obvious course now was to
resume the thread of the land journey, an
indefinite sojourn at Jaffa being unthink-
able. Heinrich Hardegg concurred, and
added unemotionally that, early though it
was, the daily train was already on its way
to the Holy City, but next morning’s train
would start at the usual hour provided the
war didn’t start first. Seeing that the Hun
landlord must have regarded me as an enemy
and the American as a potential enemy, lie
was really very decent, but not comforting.
The comments of Phineas were like the roar
of a peevish lion:
“Somebody’s tied an anchor to us, and
we’re dragging it behind us, and we’ll never
reach anywhere. We're not moving on—
we’re going back. We’re further away than
we were three days ago. If this was the
United States we could have covered a thou-
sand miles in the time we’ve sat here look-
ing out at a pack of niggers. What sort of
country do you call this, anyhow?”
“I didn’t make it,” said the licensed vic-
tualler with a trace of heat. “I never called
it anything. It was named before I came
here.”
This line of inquiry being closed, Kervick
proceeded broodingly to compose another of
those telegrams which fetched no response.
I believe it was to the legal or semi-official
people at Damascus, and I fancy it was the
one in which he told them to attend to the
burial of the late Mrs. Kervick, and autho-
rised them to take over and hold in trust
all her belongings, with a special eye to
her will, if she was carrying that document
about with her. Then we fell back on eat-
ing, drinking, smoking, desultory conversa-
tion, a half-hearted game of cards, and in-
quiry concerning the attitude of the Water-
side AVorkers’ Union. The evening train
brought four more guests, whose tempers
weren’t improved when they view r ed the situa-
tion. They reported that the war was being
much talked of at Jerusalem, and that
strange characters were unusually plentiful,
including tall Arabs of the blackened or
desert type—the kind who carry long, heavy
staffs akin to loaded clothes-props and look
with scorn upon city-dwellers. In addition
to our other activities we speculated in a
dragoman. He proved a rather resourceless
being in some respects, but he was a mine
of information concerning wayside inns,
tombs, holy sites, miracles, bones, ruins and
legends. His name, if I recall it rightly,
w r as Mohammed AVassif Bulbul Gerabli.
Among his specific items of information our
new follower knew the hostelry where Job’s
three comforters stopped for a snack and a
drink when on their way to comfort Job.
Every Palestinian tavern, especially in the
south, has some such legend hanging about
it, and few legends are strictly accurate. It
appeared improbable that we would have
any use for the Three Comforters Inn, but
it proved to be a haven of refuge.
Life was a pleasant thing as our train
jogged uphill in the clean, fresh morning air
carrying Kervick and his troubled fortunes,
also me and Bulbul Gerabli, and the four
travellers of last night, and some odds and
ends. Everybody was cheerful at once—
for once. I ceased even to hate Captain
Winckler, whose misjudged violence had
created so much trouble, and I regarded
Heinrich Hardegg, whose bill had been mon-
strous, as a brother. This western slope
is the land of Samson and of David’s earlier
adventures, and is wholly different from the
“skully” country which composes the slope
on the other side of Jerusalem. The term
“skully” is out of a guide-book put together
by a partially Americanised native, who
claimed in the preface to be a graduate of a
hydropathic university in Oklahoma. It re-
ferred to the fact that the array of little
hills between the city and the Dead Sea are
round and white and bare, and only want
eye-holes to be human. Our means of loco-
motion ambled after its mild fashion into a
shallow cutting in which was a curve. Just
round the curve an ass had died in the night.
Some jackals who had outstayed their usual
hour were eating the ass, and by an absolute
miracle of luck we ran over two of them.
The ordinary jackal of commerce is oily
though not plausible, in which respect it
falls short of the middle partner in the his-
toric firm of Quirk, Gammon and Snap, who
was both. The engine gently skidded off the
rails; then it apparently skode on to them
again. Finally it skud, or it. might be more
accurate to say it skad, off the other way.
Finally it bumped the rock wall, turned over,
and lay on its back with its legs sticking
up in the air. There was no unseemlv haste,
and all things had been done decently and
in order. No one was badly hurt that I ever
heard of, and no one appeared much fright-
ened barring Mohammed Bulbul Gerabli,
who was pale as death and shrieked dis-
mally. Our data,died train, bloodstained
and smelling badly of jackal, rolled gently
out of the cutting, and was brought to a
stand in the open country. The general
opinion, collected for us by our dragoman,
was that traffic would resume in a few days.
Incompetent native assistance was pre-
sently arriving from various quarters. More
or less incompetent hand-power assistance is
seldom wanting in that country. No diffi-
culty was experienced in getting my bag and
Phineas P. Kervick’s six packages of ward-
robe shifted across country to the main road,
and along it to the inn of the Three Com-
forters. They had left, so there was no lack
of accommodation, mostly of the kind suit-


able for a race which wears skirts, carries
its own bedding and sleeps on the earthen
floor, but the bar was well furnished with
plain drinks. Of the 32 knoAvti varieties
of cocktail not one Avas to be had. Kervick,
true to his regular habit, wanted to be sup-
plied with a telegraph office, but none existed
within miles. Then he fell back on his other
habit of shaking his fist verbally at the uni-
verse. .
“Good heavens,” he said, “they call tins
a backward country, but it’s worse than
that! It’s going further back all the time
and carrying us with it. We get a week
further away every day. If you owned a
country like this what would you do with it t
I said I would give it to an enemy, but
he wasn’t listening. He proceeded, through
the medium of the dragoman, to furnish
the landlord with a sketch of our problems,
and our recent history, and our wanderings.
I suppose he had a right to his misery. If
the late Mrs. Kervick had forgotten to pro-
vide for him, I reckoned to a certainty that
the influence Avliicli kept him in his present
position, which seemed a good one, was gone,
and that he would have to earn his own
wardrobe till he could marry again. What
his original line of industry, apart from
being a very presentable spectacle, might
have been was beyond me. He was above
being a dancing-master or a hairdresser.
Probably he was simply a professional hus-
band, whose third Avife had tried to improve
him. One result of his loquacity Avas that
I received, through Mohammed Wassif Bul-
bul Gerabli, an offer from a long, dark person
to convey me across the desert to Egypt, by
contract and on camel. The matter was re-
ferred to me with the information that the
tenderer was one of a brigand and outdoor
homicide family which practised on the road
further south. He did advance agency work.
The idea of being bagman to a bushranger
struck me as grotesque.
The event of the afternoon was the loafing
past of what might have been either a troop
of cavalry or a collection of p’ainted vagrants
on horseback. We learned that they were
in hot pursuit of somebody in connection
with disturbances which had broken out at
Jerusalem. This recalled the almost forgot-
ten war. In the end avc spent an uncomfort-
able night at the Three Comforters, Gerabli
reporting that, though he had scoured the
district far and near, adequate transport
was not procurable till daybreak. The
natural result was that early afternoon had
been reached before we arrived on assbaek
in sight of Jerusalem, and had a chance to
indulge anew in pious emotion on viewing
the sacred and storied centre of the Christian
faith. Our freight and commissariat asses
made the caravan an imposing spectacle.
Gerabli had been a worried menial all day.
Considerable traffic pervaded the road, mostly
heading for the city, and he communicated
Avith it in all languages. The result was
that at a certain cross road he suggested
that we should omit Jerusalem altogether—
that, in fact, Ave should skirt the ancient
walls in a northerly direction, thus setting
out on our real journey at last. The local
German population, he said, which was con-
siderable and influential, had come to town
for news and filled up the hotels, and was
slaying the British Empire Avith its mouth.
Having a pull with the authorities it had
already kicked several suspected Allies Avith
impunity and probably Avith connivance. The
chronic grudge between Turks and Arabs
had brightened up in the war atmosphere,
and deputations had arrived, both from Haifa
and Jaffa, to demand the head of Captain
Winckler. It was probably three parts
imagination, for our stipendiary hanger-on,
like Kipling’s Bengali police spy, was “a
most fearful man,” but the plan seemed good.
There was definite motion in it. Four
miles along the road, it appeared, there Avas
an old-established hotel of particular excel-
lence. It was noted for the fact that the
proprietor had been standing at the door
when Judas Iscariot went by, with a fiendish
expression on his face and a rope dragging
behind him—not this proprietor but an
earlier one. The apostle hadn’t even returned
a civil answer when spoken to, and his aspect
had scared the baby—not the present baby
but a previous one. Later the inquest had
been held at the same inn, and Judas having
once been in the vineyard business the local
liquor interest had exerted nself to secure a
verdict of “Death by misadventure.” Through
the negligence of a clerk named Abimelech
the deceased had really been entered as
“Found drowned.” Being urged to cut the
legend short and get to details lest his aged
parents should be suddenly left childless,
Gerabli said that, provided our ass-train put

HER (bitterly): “You deceived me when you
married me.”
HIM : “I did more —I deceived myself.”
its best hoof foremost, there was no reason
why Ave shouldn’t reach our stopping-place
before dark. He would then go forth and,
in a way not calculated to arouse attention,
order the necessary carriage, team and driver
for the morning, lverviek told him to in-
quire at the post-office while he was out.
A few subsequent days were so uneventful
that it is most convenient to put them in
diary form.
First Day: Left the Judas Neck Hotel
early, with a clear sky and a favorable
breeze. Scenery better than the road. The
team consisted of two females and a male,
and disagreements arose. Progress slow and
fitful. The driver, a wizened silent Arab
who suggested Young Smallweed out of
“Bleak House,” proved handy and useful.
Was stepped upon in a mild way by one
of the animals in the course of one of the
disagreements, and arrived at Shechem late
ana in some pain. Stopped at the French
hospital to have my foot looked at. Gerabli
said strangers avoided the Turkish hospital
on account of—he put it frankly—bugs.
Countless bugs. Being fixed up, proceeded
to the hotel, which was owned by a German
of the militant type. The war had raised
him to a state of exaltation akin to an opium
dream. He was willing to accommodate any-
body except a British subject, which was me.
If any Englander stayed long in the vicinity
of his pub he might be driven to shoot in seif-
defence. Though the war was only a few
days old there was a good deal of self-defence
about. Went back to the French doctor,
who sti-ained a point, and took us in as pay-
ing patients. We were entered as an epi-
demic.
Second Day: Delayed by unaccountable
damage to vehicle, which almost looked as
if someone had been acting in self-defence.
Had thought to break away from the Iver-
vick-Gerabli expedition at Haifa and ensnare
a boat for Egypt, but learned that the hold-
up was even worse at that port than at
Jaffa. Haifa was the scene of Captain Win-
ckler’s crime, and consequently the centre
of coastal disturbance. • The doctor said
that the new straight road to Tiberias, which
had been formally opened the day before the
war, was the best and safest way to Damas-
cus and to an open port. He hadn’t seen it,
but he had heard the opening in the distance.
Gerabli, who was an older resident than the
doctor, said the new road was a relief work
which had been on hand for 23 years, and he
almost doubted its existence. Sent the Arab
driver on horseback to reconnoitre. He came
HE'D WON THE V.C. AT THE WAR.
ERMYSTRUDE : “They tell me you love music.”
BILL : “Yes, but never mind, keep on playing.”
back to report, in his taciturn way, that he
believed he could get a team and the vehicle
over the road if the stallion was left behind
or killed. A wasted day, though we became
acquainteJ with a minor bishop, who eked
out the revenues of his diocese by retail
fruit-dealing, find also inspected a denomi-
nation school in a loft.
Third Day: Quitted Shechem with a
north-westerly trend, following for a time
the old Haifa-road. Ruins of Samaria in
distance. Arab driver suddenly turned olf
with a north-easterly trend, and started
through the cultivation. Remonstrances were
useless. He said it was the new road which
bad been officially opened. After two or
three miles the wheel-tracks developed into
something definite. The Turk had forgotten
to make the end of his road, but he had
made a road. Pursued this cheerfully till
we came to a place where it had slipped off
the side of a little hill, and settled down in
a little heap in a little vale below. New
roal had died of old age. Surprised but
calm, for the Arab hadn't foreseen this, we
steered down into the cultivation. Steered
up again when track resumed. Midday halt
beside a sacred spring where lepers used to
be miraculously healed. Hadn’t the plea-
sure of witnessing the remarkable operation,
all lepers having gone to lunch. Later the
path became a causeway over a flat where
floods were frequent. Met six breaks through
non-completion of culverts or bridges. Some-
times the holes were deserted. Sometimes
toilers hung round waiting for materials.
Mostly well up in years—through waiting
for materials. Grew tired of diverging into
the cultivation. Last mile or two covered
with thistles—an old edition. Finished the
long day in moderate spirits, but nothing to
boast of. , , .
Fourth Day: Very dreary, but reached
Nazareth and breathed in the atmosphere of
its sacred associations. Also breathed it
out again. The wayside inns we had passed
during the last two days were not rich in
sacred associations like those of the South,
though Elijah had occasionally dropped in.
Kervick was depressed by the lack of tele-
graphic facilities at most of the liamlets( we
had passed. He suggested that we should
make an urgent night stage to Tiberias, but
the state of the team forbade.
Fifth Day: Should have arrived at Tiberias
in abundant time to connect with the launch
which would take us down the hallowed Sea
of Galilee to connect with the train, but
didn’t. The worn and sketchy harness dis-
solved on an up grade, and the team went off
one way on a grazing expedition while the
carriage rolled the other way. Came in
sight of hallowed sea aforementioned in time
to watch the launch vanish, and to marvel
that so little water had "caused so much
literature. Spent the long day being boated
around to New Testament ruins, where there
were priests, dogs and receptacles for con-
tributions.
Sixth Day: Reached Damascus in a train
whose characteristics were dust, sloth, in-
sufficient feeding arrangements, no drinking
arrangements, and lack of polite society.
Found the thread of the narrative ready to
resume at the station.
Though the hour was late Mrs. Kervick
was waiting for her husband on the platform.
Behind her stood a fine carriage, a liveried
driver, and a dragoman of a more costly-
looking type than our own Bulbul Gerabli.
They sell expensive dragomans in Damascus.
(The tale, as I afterwards pieced it out,
was that the besotted Turkish post-office at
Jericho had given Phineas the wrong tele-
gram, which would be more natural for them
than to deliver the right one.) At the first
glance I reconstructed my picture of the
lady. She might be older than her husband,
but not very much older —perhaps 40 to his
35. She was tall and. in a rather mascu-
line sort of way, handsome. Her outstand-
ing characteristic was that she looked cap-
able. She came forward with a rather
malicious smile on her lips and two devils of
mirth dancing in her eyes.
“Well, my husband,” she said. “In the
three days I’ve been here I seem to have
heard a great deal about you.”
The impression on my mind was that
Phineas Kervick turned pale right down to
the bottom of his carpet-bag. I turned the
handiest corner, taking my own solitary bag
and Gerabli with me. Half that menial was
my property, and Phineas was in such effici-
ent hands that he could do without his half
for a time. We ascertained, by making over-
tures to Mrs. Kervick’s coachman, where the
resurrected wife was living and carefully
went elsewhere. Then I settled with my
moiety of the dragoman and got rid of him,
after which I surveyed my line of retreat to
Beirut and the sea. Four things I did hot
desire: —
To have Phineas P. Kervick come and weep on
my shoulder, and possibly consult me about his
prospects, if his wife paid him off.
To have him again for a travelling companion (he
being the embodiment of bad luck) if his wife sent
him into exile.
To meet Mrs. Kervick, and be asked for details.
I hate details.
To get into the habit of haunting Damascus rail-
way stations, lest Phineas should have other wives
waiting and they should also want details.
With all these objects in view I ascertained
from the landlord that there would be no
difficulty about conveyance in the morning
to a station some miles down the line where
the coast-bound train could be intercepted. It
was another proof of the evil results of
travelling with a Jonah that I now learned,
for the first time, that all my devious doings
since I left Shechem, the ancient city of
Jacob, where the obliging French doctor had
put me on his disease list, had been wasted
labor. The indomitable Captain Winckler
had in some way triumphed over his enemies.
On the very morning when I went buggy
driving over the cultivation and turned my
back on Haifa, that place became a free port,
the strike being declared off and the hatchet
buried. It was even reported in the little
German rag published at Beirut that Winck-
ler had been cheered by the Waterside
Workers’ Union at Jaffa, but that was frill,
devised to promote good feeling and a Hun-
Turkish rapprochement.
I slept soundly in a bedroom overlooking
the river Barada, which tinkles through the
city and makes music of a mirthful sort, and
I was up early, for a retreat should start
while the day is young, if it doesn't
start late the night before. But in
the natural order of events the hour
wasn’t early enough to avert a call from Mrs.
Kervick. The immemorial sluggishness of
Asia makes it impossible for one to get away
in time to avoid anybody at a real crisis
unices he trusts to his own feet. She was
reasonable and outwardly calm, but there
were smouldering fires within. No actual
smoke was visible coming out of her hat, yet
anyone could sense combustion. Her desire
was to learn whether I, as her husband’s
travelling companion during an interesting
period, could tell her anything that might
improve her opinion of that shallow and
veneered specimen of humanity.
Certainly she had cause to complain.
When her arrival at Damascus w r as
known, which was inside 30 minutes,
she had been waited upon by the
people who had instructions to bury
her immediately and to take charge of her
belongings, especially of her will, if procur-
able. They had haunted the hotels, in a
scandalous attempt to bury her, for two days
before her arrival, and covered her name with
ridicule. They had naturally shown her their
instructions, which were more voluminous
SO WOULD HER PARENTS.
“I should just like to see the man that I'd
promise to love, honor and obey.”
“I am sure you would, darling.”
and insistent than I had dreamed of. Mrs.
Kervick inquired, in a pleasing contralto
voice, whether her husband had shown any
emotion on hearing of her death—apart, of
course, from commercial emotion.
It was a complication, and I had no desire
to give evidence either way, but there was a
possible loophole of escape, and 1 made for
it at a good pace. Bulbul Gerabli could only
prove, so far as his own knowledge went,
that Phineas and I were accomplices at Jaffa
and afterwards, and Phineas had time to get
over the first bitterness of his grief by that
time. In taking this line I made insufficient
allowance for what a brilliant woman might
do with even such a primitive instrument as
a Turkish telegraph service. The next ques-
tion concerned the lady at Jericho of whom
I had secured just one glimpse before she hid
herself. Did she give way to any emotion?
Did she, for instance, wipe her eyes with
her veil while we were looking at the monas-
tery of St. George on the morning of August
6?
A weak fop, who looked half like Darnley
and half like Absalom (both of whom
came to a bad end), must have a bard life
when married to a thoroughly capable con-
tralto unless he walks the chalkline of recti-
tude. Phineas Kervick, I opined, never could
walk a chalkline, and my sympathies began
to veer a little in his direction. Still, they
only veered a little, for Patricia Kervick
seemed to deserve better luck than had come
her way. In the new turn of events I could
only fall back on my dignity, and say that
if my veracity was at a discount, or a low
ebb, or anything of the sort there was little
to be gained by answering further questions.
Then she came to the point, and put the
matter plainly. Supposing she decided to
divorce her bad bargain instead of turning
him adrift with (or without) a small pen-
sion, would I give evidence in court, my ex-
penses to the scene of execution being paid
on a liberal scale, or would I prefer to give
my full testimony on oath before some consul
or other competent official right off. My full
testimony, forsooth! She plainly imagined
I was full of testimony.
So Phineas would apparently lose his “law-
ful visible” and be blotted out, like the Carib
race of whom a melancholy bard said they
“left a blank among the works of God.” He
would cease to have a history, after the
manner of the bankrupt and broken-hearted
warrior of whom nothing further was known
save that “his banner led the spears no more
among the hills of Spain”—not that I re-
garded Phineas as a probable spearman of
any sort. It occurred to me idly that if the
lady, apart from her natural anger because
of her husband’s efforts at burial, had no
more tangible grievance than the veiled
beauty of Jericho, the pair had been married
even more recently than I had assumed.
There was nothing in the point, but it was
a detail. Some hard and rapid consideration
followed.
I didn’t propose to help in the execution.
I was not going before any consul. Not
only did it seem ridiculous, but it was unde-
sirable to perjure myself by swearing to the
address which I intended presently to
Mrs. Kervick, and I had no intention of'
leaving my real address, so that I might be
written to for further information, or applied
to for aid by Phineas if he fell into decay.
Besides, nothing I could say would probably
persuade the lady that I wasn’t suppressing
the other half of the truth. And it would be
still worse policy to refuse all help to one
in Mrs. Ivervick’s present mood, and possibly
have her private detective walking a yard
behind me all the way back to Egypt. So
far as I could remember I had told Phineas
nothing more definite than that I had arrived
from London, and it seemed a good place to
lose myself in. So I promised that I
would be available whenever wanted, and
would reveal all or even more at the right
time. Then, taking a chance on the lady's
transatlantic ignorance, I gave my permanent
location as No. 10 Downing-street. It was
the one scrap of mirth I extracted from the
paltry business. If Phineas’s affairs washed
up on the steps of No, 10, I trust that both
Mr. Asouith and his talented wife were at
home. His politics annoy me, likewise her
books.
Then, adhering to my original plan, I got
into my vehicle and told the driver to beat
the band on the road to the wayside station
hereinbefore mentioned. The big terminus
would have been more convenient, but the
Kervick divorce case might be there in some
form or another. If. for instance, somebody
—the hotel landlord or a fellow guest—-
was referred to in a moment of suspicion
about No. 10 Downing-street. it was remotely
possible that a very reproachful lady might
be there in person.

PEACE AND GOODWILL!


A Ballad of St. John of Ardan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WEARY and pale was the wind
Crying across the plain ;
The sun with cloud was blind,
The stark trees mourned for rain.
And he was wearier than the day.
Storm-tossed above his beard of grey.
Better his lot than praise
Could speak on the empty air;
For the people in all ways
Named his name as a prayer,
Thinking “God made this holy man
Most perfect by His blessed plan.”
Sinless as white of the bloom,
Kind as the light of the Spring,
In his heart was an empty room
And a song that he might not sing;
For life’s best fruit untasted hung
On a tree he passed when he was young.
“Turn back my steps!” he cried.
“What heaven is mine to win,
Who lived and loved and lied
And have not tasted sin?
I am as empty as the look
That falls on an unwritten book.”
Thereon an angel made
The dial shine with light.
Till the shadow ran like a thing afraid
Backward through day and night:
So fast it fled that the numbers burned
And the years were lost and youth returned.
So, walking far in the morn
Under a way of trees,
He came to a valley of corn
With a pleasant murmur of bees ;
And his chin was as soft as a lady’s hand
And his hair the color of sunset sand.
Thereon the angel said :
“Beach for the fruit by the way.
You have two young eyes in an old head
And it is the first of the day.”
And there was a house with the door wide
And the sweets of the world were all inside.
But he said, “I will not go in,
Though the sight is good to see,
For over the hill is a better sin
That perhaps is waiting for me.”
So he went his way and came to a place
With a door shut and an evil face.
But he said, “I will go beyond
By a hill that is steeper than this.
I want the sin that is fond,
Though a soul might die on a kiss.”
And it was fallen brown night
When he came to a house with a fair light.
And he was weary then,
And sore for food and rest;
But he went in for the great sin
That he might sin his best.
The moon went thin into the west;
And he went in to sin his best.
They set him a bowl of milk,
And their eyes were as black as sloes,
Three women with hair of silk
And a speech that no man knows.
And they set him honey and white bread
And broke a red rose over his head.
And the first one played upon strings,
And the second one blew on a flute,
And the third had the look the moonrise
brings
On a tree heavy with fruit;
And she sang him a song like the morn-
ing of birds
That says all things with no words.
And fain was he to stay
Listening and listening long;
The night grew into the day
And the day grew into the song;
And the song grew into the wonder of life,
As if God made the Spring his wife.
When the angel knocked at the door
The beard of the man was grey,
And his feet were weak on the floor
As he set his hands to pray.
“Have you sinned your best?” the angel said.
But the man’s tongue was dumb in his
head.
AS GOOD AS A LEADING ARTICLE.
HER : “ I married you out of pity—I felt sorry for you at the time.”
HIM : “Well, you moulded popular opinion. Everyone feels sorry
for me now.”
And they went by a long green way
Over the twenty hills
Till they came to the front of a bay
Where the sea always spills
Blossom of water on yellow sand;
And the angel loosed the man’s hand.
“Go back to your prayers,” he said,
“Go back to your alms and win
A place with the holy dead;
For you have no heart for sin.”
And the man went on, growing old
And older still, with a thought of gold.

The Vicarage Curtains.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AN assertion made by one schoolgirl about
another is the genesis of this story.
Remarks of the type made by June
Burton usually fall still-born from the
speaker's lips, or else they lie on the surface
of life for a while and then die of neglect.
But Olive Pemberton, to whom the insult was
addressed, treated it as a seed to be planted
SEE THE DIFFERENCE?
HER MAN FRIEND: “You’re looking well to-night!”
HER: “Yes, naturally.”
HER GIRL FRIEND: “No — artificially.”
with hating care and tended with ceaseless
remembrance. It would germinate at a short
distance of time, or after many years, as
opportunity offered.
Olive was a large, fat, fair girl of nearly
fifteen, with a cable of plaited hair like new
Manila hemp. Her attendance at such a
smart, expensive school as White Cedars was
made possible by the kindness of the vicar of
Glenn and his wife. As a day pupil she
was not wearing the boarders’ school uniform
of navy-blue and white. All the winter she
had been suitably clad in a woolly frock
of black and cream, but to-day, the first warm
day of Spring, she had arrived in a costume
that won prolonged scrutiny from the
kindly, speculative eyes of governesses, and
the cruel, frank eyes of early youth. It con-
sisted of an overdress of heavy cream lace on
a slip of the same shade.
The history class was being taken out of
doors by Miss Graham within scent and sight
of the trees for which the school was named.
Tiny lavender blossoms blew into the girls’
hair and into their inkwells.
, June Burton sat up, suddenly interested.
Miss Graham had begun to say something
really interesting about Charles Stuart.
June was the prettiest girl in the school. A
brilliant little brunette of twelve, with a
close, red mouth. Before Charles Stuart had
advanced more than a few paces on his pic-
turesque and foolish way, Miss Hethering-
ton, the principal, appeared with an open
telegram in her hand and began an under-
toned conversation with Miss Graham. Pres-
ently both ladies walked slowly away, the
governess listening to the principal with
lowered head and an air of exaggerated atten-
tion and courtesy. The class giggled, and
Ella Lowe, who was June’s neighbor, said
Miss Graham was dreadfully “put on.” “That
telegram,” she continued, “is most likely
from Ma Boardman asking after Mabel’s
sore throat.”
“Yes,” chipped
in a tall girl who
wore a ring and
bangles, “and
think it was from
St. Peter, reply
paid, asking old
Hetherington to
send his keys,
which he’d forgot-
ten when dining
with her last
night.”
High above the
laughter with
which this sally
disordered the
class rose a shrill,
pot unmusical,
blurred rhythm.
Olive Pemberton
was giving her
Cicada Intermezzo,
and in a sudden
silence the girls
turned to watch
her. She was
striking her lower
lip quick, down-
ward taps with a
lead-pencil while
chirruping and
droning her
strange composi-
tion.
“Stop her, oh, do stop her!” entreated
June Burton ; then, her voice taking on her
mother’s tones when the twin boys scuffled
in her presence, “she makes me nervous.”
Olive ceased her symphony long enough
to sneer: “Listen, piccaninnies, listen to the
twelve-year-old complaining of nerves! If
she’s got ’em now, what’ll she have at my
age?” Then she resumed the cicada enter-
tainment.
June Burton, her vivid little face burning,
whispered rapidly to the girls close to her.
They crowded nearer ; others leant across
them and listened with growing excitement.
Something acutely interesting was afoot.
“Looks like a football scrum,” remarked the
girl with the ring and bangles: then she, too,
inclined an ear and heard what June Burton
had said. The class fell quiet, not because
Miss Graham was returning, but because
every girl was avidly staring at Olive, who
kept up her symphony until Charles Stuart
took the stage again.
During lunch-hour every girl in the school
knew what June Burton had made public—
that Olive Pemberton’s lace overskirt had
been made from the vicarage curtains.
The jeer came full-circle with Olive her-
self. She merely started her Intermezzo de-
fiantly, and when she got home wrote on a
sheet of notepaper
June Burton — Sept. 20, 1912,
and put it into the innermost drawer of the
desk her late father had given her.
* * * *
“Nurse Osborn to see you, Sir Michael, by
appointment.”
The distinguished physician, without look-
ing up from his notes, replied: “I have no
appointment with anyone of that name.”
“It's her married name, sir; she used to be
Nurse Olive Pemberton, and” —-but the dis-
tinguished physician was already at the door
of his waiting-
room, personally
conducting his old
friend’s daughter
to the chair facing
the light near his
desk.
“You’ve changed
a good deal, Olive,”
he said after a
moment’s scrutiny.
“Let me see, you
are twenty-five?
Twenty-six?”
“But don’t you
thing the change is
for the better, Sir
Michael? Nearly
two stone lighter
than when you
said good-bye to us
in Egypt, and
darker. I’m potato-
brown now, in-
stead of Swede
turnip.”
He was still
studying her; and,
slightly embar-
rassed, she asked,
“You don’t approve
of the alteration?”
“I do, I do,” he
assured her with
conviction. “But I
was thinking how
curiously a number
of you young folk
have made over
your faces in a few
years. The stress
of war-time. Now,
I don’t recall you
as having that long
line of jaw.”
“It must have
been there, under
the fat. The last
boy I nursed told
me I had a long,
punishing jaw—his hobby was bull-terriers.”
Sir Michael nodded. “And you married
young Fred Osborn? —a fine boy.”
“He was killed six weeks later.”
“This case to which I am sending you.
Mrs. Burton”
“Not Judge Burton’s wife?”
“Yes, you know them?”
“Not at all; but the society papers used to
tell of a raving beauty named June Burton,
whose stalls were so successful. Is she re-
lated?”
The nurse’s eyes and head were lowered ;
she picked up a pencil from the desk and
seemed to be intently studying the imprint,
“Made in U.S.A.”
“The only daughter. She and her father
were coming with me to London—you know
I ro next week —but Mrs. Burton’s illness
took this fatal turn; it is merely a matter
of waiting for the end.”
“So bad as that —how long?”
“She may live for the remainder of the
year. I doubt if she’ll see 1923 in.” The
doctor’s tone altered. The ebat became a con-
ference, technical and confidential.
* * * *
Mrs. Burton’s nurse was seated very close
to her charge, intently studying the wreck of
a beautiful woman. Thin, faded, brown hair;
sallow skin that might have been pasted over
the perfectly-modelled bones of the face;
sunken brown eyes, and a fleshless figure
scarcely outlined under the billowy rest-
gown.
Olive was frankly mystified. Sir Michael
had been gone some weeks, and for the present
she could not share her mystification with
the other medical men in charge.
The Judge came into the room. He and
his daughter were dining out. “Good-bye
for a few hours, Kitty dearest,” he said, and
would have embraced his wife, but the angle
at which she reclined directly he appeared
made the gesture ineffective.
“Good-bye, Phil—there's the car.” Her
eyes were closed, but as he left the room they
opened alertly enough, gazing after him. "I
know no man who wears his dinner-clothes
with better effect,” she sighed.
Olive resumed her appraising scrutiny, but
presently she seemed to have solved the
problem to her own satisfaction. “There is
someone else,” she told herself with convic-
tion—“there is someone else.”
There are thoughts so vibrant and forceful
that they become audible. This one did.
Slowly Mrs. Burton turned her head, and,
fixing her dark, misty eyes on her nurse, she
suddenly smiled.
“No, there isn't anyone else.”
The girl’s face flamed ; she half-rose from
her chair.
“No, it is not what you think, nurse.”
Then June came in, very effusive, and
radiant in dinner-dress. Her adieux were
made to an apparently fast-asleep parent.
Nearly two months had trailed by. Every
day the patient’s hold on life relaxed a little
more. She ate a little less, slept a little
less, touched her piano keys for fewer
minutes. She was dying, as Sir Michael had
predicted, but not the way he had forecasted.
One evening late in June Nurse Osborn
locked the doors of the dressing-room, put
her charge into an easy-chair, then knelt
by her, and, taking the two frail hands in her
own large, warm clasp, she spoke.
“Dear, we are now something more than
patient and nurse, we are friends —and I am
slow to use that word. Dear, why are you
doing this? Tell me the truth. I promise
to respect all you say. Did you deliberately
deceive Sir Michael?”
“Yes, deliberately. I had the time of my
life doing it, for I have a quite good sense
of humor.”
“But, why, why, why die at your age?
My mother married again at your age, forty-
three, and she is happier and younger than I
am.”
Mrs. Burton smiled faintly. “It would
take a long time to tell you, and 1 am not
equal to long Speeches.”
“But I am, as you have said, ‘so under-
standing.’ ”
“My husband and I were the greatest of
chums and lovers. It was an achievement to
live on what he earned at the Junior Bar.
You’d scarcely credit how I worked. And I
was almost his equal in mentality. He ad-
mits that without qualification. He hadn’t

tlic time to read literature, science or the
hi" questions of the day. I made the time.
I held his friends and made others. 1 kept
him in the swim, always hiding from him
how shallow was the water at times. What-
ever demands he or the children made on me
I was equal to. I crammed the boys for
exams.”
“Yes, yes, I understand.” Olive spoke
softly.
“Things got easier; he was successful and
high in his profession, and I was looking
forward to travelling with him. I had kept
my looks marvellously considering the way
I worked with my head and my hands. Then
I fell ill of influenza—you remember the
epidemic of two years ago. I was ill for
months. When I was well enough to manage
my house again and receive our friends”
She stopped abruptly and her eyes filled with
tears.
“Your daughter had taken your place?”
ventured the nurse.
“Yes, and my looks had gone. Both June
and my husband wished me to settle down
as a beloved invalid and nonentity. We had
just inherited quite a lot of money. June
and her father were going out a great deal,
and now it was June who wished to travel.
She managed the home perfectly. I grant that.
When I tried to keep my husband by me to
talk about everything under the sun as we


ased to in the old days, June insisted that
he was wearying me. She put me to bed
and took him out to a theatre or a dance.
How we mothers can be done without! This
morning, as you know, I rang up my two boys
at the University. I had had no reply to my
letters of four days ago. They protested
with many apologetic ‘darling Alums’ that
they had forgotten to open the letters.”
‘‘Oh. that’s boylike and scallywaggish,”
said the nurse. "But you could not have
been shunted if you had allowed yourself to
recover thoroughly.”
“Probably not. What is killing me is the
fact that my husband has so easily accepted
my passing out of his life as well as my
own.”
“I won’t admit that it is accepted easily ;
but. manlike, he takes the line of least
resistance in domestic matters. From what
I see and what Sir Michael told me, your
husband is despairingly accepting it.”
“I straining their nerves a little, I
think. You know when people say, ‘The
sooner the poor darling is out of her misery
the better,’ they really mean the better for
them.” She gave another of her rare, rather
wide smiles.
“It was those beautiful teeth of yours that
first made me suspicious. You could not
keep them and have all the complication of
diseases Sir Michael llow did you
manage it?”
"I took chemistry when I graduated. The
knowledge helped. My husband and children
would not have accepted my jading out of
life. I would have been pestered with foot-
ling changes of air, and more doctors, and all
sorts of remedies. I just wanted the thing
to appear final and hopeless, and to be let
alone.”
The nurse was pacing the room ; her face
was flushed, and presently she looked like
Decision spelt with capitals. “It boils down
to this,” she ruminated. “This woman is
dying of wounded vanity and of disappoint-
ment that her husband didn’t declare that
he could not live without her, and would die
when she died.” Then, apropos of nothing,
she began a recital of her work in the sana-
torium in U-S.A., one that was famous for
its beauty-culture department. Hours later
the patient in bed was still listening eagerly,
when the Judge and his daughter returned.
Nurse Osborn slipped out of the room and
intercepted them. The three walked into
the library.
Judge Burton was disturbed and anxious
after the nurse had stated her case. No, he
would not agree to his wife being carried off
to a New Zealand sanatorium. She could not
survive the voyage. If she went, he also
would go.
The nurse argued calmly. No one or any-
thing of her present environment should go
with her. Then she turned to June and
found the expected ally.
The hard, bright girl took up the nurse’s
argument. “Nurse Osborn is quite right,
father. If yon go, mother won’t. She must
have all fresh surroundings. You know how
she’s turned against both of us, and she is
not as near the end as the doctors believe.
You think she may live till we return from
Europe, don’t you nurse—provided we go
now and are not away more than a
year ?”
The nurse leant forward and looked into
a bronze ashtray as if it was a crystal and
she a gazer. “I am perfectly certain that
your mother will live till your return,” she
said, raising her cool grey eyes to look
steadily at the Judge.
Again June Burton took up the argument.
A\ hen the nurse left the room five minutes
later the girl was nagging her father.
“We win,” chuckled the nurse. “She
wins. When the nagger nags the man
sags.”
* * * *
On the first available liner went Judge
Burton and his daughter. Nurse Osborn
did not remove her invalid till later in the
Spring, but in the interval she got rid of
Mrs. Burton’s personal maid and all the
mirrors in that wing of the house. Before
taking her patient on to the Niagara she
pasted brown papers over the mirrors in the

cabin. Anyone likely to enter, whether
attendants or kindly inquirers amongst the
voyagers, was instructed to tell Mrs. Burton
"how much better you look since you came on
board.”
Face foods, skin tonics, cream-cleansers,
muscle-oils, astringent hair-tonics, velvet-pad
polishers, brusliers, powders, manicure am-
munition—-the quantity and variety carried
on board indicated Olive Osborn’s optimism
and expectation of a long but winning fight.
Also, before leaving Sydney, the nurse picked
over a lot of her patient’s jewellery and had
some of it reset. She did not say “May
I?” or “By your leave”; she just acted.
Long earrings liad come in,to fashion, and
jewelled bandeaux were in the boom. She
showed a fastidious taste; only stones suit-
able for a brunette, with brown and amber
and russet tones, were selected. Judge Bur-
ton had left her quite a lot of the inherited
money to play with.

for what her patient called “the resurrec-
tion of the mummy.” The invalid was fed,
and fed, and massaged, and massaged, and
brushed, and brushed like a costly Persian
cat, and creamed like a chicken, and polished
like a pearl. She was lied to and ministered
to from dawn to dusk. The falsehoods told
her of her looks and weight proved the value
the nurse put on psychiatry. Well-bribed
menials would say loudly, off-stage, “What
a pretty woman Mrs. Burton is!”
But after three months what had been
fiction became fact. Mrs. Burton had put
on nearly two stone in weight. She had a
thick, short growth of dark coppery hair;
her eyes were coming out of their caverns.
“Another two months,” mused the nurse,
“and some charming man will have to be
found to help out the treatment. By then
she will be quite fit to sit up and take
admiration.”
A pile of Brahms music was put within
reach of the lady, and presently the lady
took the hint: she played with charm.
“All my dice are loaded,” wrote Nurse
Osborn to her mother in Sydney. “Yester-
day completed our fifth month at this resort,
and Mrs. Burton got a letter from her
daughter announcing her engagement to a
man who had travelled Londonward in the
same liner—a New Zealander, by the way, a
man named Webester. She was so bril-
liantly excited by the news that I reckoned
it was time to bring the mirrors back and
let her see herself. We got her into a dinner
gown, a jewelled
bandeau, long ear-
rings and a pearl
rope; then I
pulled the cami-
sole off the long
mirror and....and

then said “I
thought it was

minute later, still
staring, she ex-

room in our suite
—that, and the car and the really good wine-
list at this hotel.” .
The poet did not nibble the bait until he
had spent an evening with the lady and
Brahms. Then he swallowed the whole line.
For weeks the nurse watched the handsome
woman’s sympathetic acceptance of the boy-
ish homage; but now the poet had rivals.
Mrs. Burton’s suite became the rendezvous
of the intelligentsia who were touring, or
salmon fishing, or boiling themselves in the
sulphur springs. Amongst them were several
world-famous names: men who had just
quitted a Science Congress held south of the
Line. Their hostess glowed like an apricot
or a marigold under the ardent sun of their
appreciation.
“I cannot understand, nurse,” she said,
“why there should be so general an idea
that lam a widow. I have difficulty in elud-
< ing offers of marriage: in fact, I have had to
listen to three already; but now, of course,
they all know.”
“I don’t wonder that Moscow put that
class to death,” dodged Olive. “It’s danger-
ously attractive, and as for them thinking
you are a widow —that's inevitable. Just
look at yourself in the glass: would any man
who was not in the grave with granite slabs
over him let you out of his sight? What a
transformation in seven months!” Then
atter a thoughtful pause: ‘I have sent to
Sydney for some autumn clothes. They’ll

law.
. Hubert Webester was back in the Dom-
inion, and coming to see his future mother-
111-law. Nurse Osborn had
done what correspondence
was necessary. His letters
intimated that he expected
to meet a dying- woman.
The goddess in the
machine had the stage set
for Ins arrival.
Webester, a fine-looking
man, 10 years older than
the girl he was to marry,
came, and what he saw was
a lady who looked no older
than himself, in radiant
health, taller than the aver-
age, and dressed as only
wealth and taste can dress
a beautiful woman. There
were no sleeves to her gown
•y • •• • those shoulders !
VVell, she showed them, and
they were worth seeing. And
that head of glistening chest-
nut hair! Was this the
mother of a girl of twenty-
three? He looked at the
men fawning around her
most of them he knew by
repute or personally.

and of late, when
she had been strong
enough to wield a
racquet, she would
not be bothered
writing. His last
letter to me
thanked God that
he would be in
time to see her
alive.”
“Patient” an d
nurse, with Hubert
W ehester, were
back in Sydney,
and Burton and
his daughter were
hurrying by ex-
press from Adel-
aide.
Again the stage
was set by the god-
dess with the long
memory. The tra-
vellers were in
Melbourne. Web-
ester met them
there.
Now they were
in Sydney.
The confessedly
young and healthy
should travel with
beauty undimmed,
but June Burton
had not. She looked
sallow and train-
worn. Her upper
lip had tightened.
The nurse sensed a
constraint between
her and Webester.
Their entry of
Mrs. Burton’s sit-
ti n g-r oo m was
almost a rush. “The
patient” was beau-
tif u 11 y morn-
ing - froc k e d.
and her arms
gleamed faintly pink and polished like
pearls: her nails were like opals, and her
hair glittered in the carefully filtered amber
light. Close beside and behind her was a
great mass of marigolds—bronze, amber and
brown. Even the silks of the embroidery
at which she was stitching and showing off
her rounded elbows were in harmony with
her coloring.
“Well, darlings,” she called out in a high,
joyous voice. “Here you are again—it does
not seem a month since you left! Phil, you
look splendid ! June, you are a perfect pic-
ture !”
She did not rise; indeed, she lay further
back in her low chair, but her husband's em-
brace pulled her to her feet. He was in-
coherent with wonder at the miracle of her
renaissance.
It was some minutes before June’s greet-
ing could be delivered. The girl could only
gasp at intervals: “Oh, mother, you look
wonderful—what’s been done to you?” Then
the Judge put his daughter gently aside
and again took his too placid wife in his
arms.
Father,” said the girl, “we are both rather
grubby. .Let us go and dress and get ready
for^ lunch. You are spoiling mother's get-
up. She left the room.
On the stairs she encountered Nurse
Osborn, who had just finished packing.
“Nurse, what have you done to mother?
She’s like a great bazaar doll or something
off a Christmas-tree. Why, she looks younger
than I do!”
“If she looks that then she is that.”
The glances of the two girls crossed with
cold insolence.
* * * *
Downstairs the luncheon gong was sound-
ing musically. Upstairs Judge Burton was
tying his tie and whistling happily.
A pair of nervous hands clutched his shirt-
sleeved arm, and a hot-eyed, enraged young
face was reflected in his mirror.
“Father, what has come over everything?
Has everyone gone mad? Oh, I wish we'd
never come back!” June was pushing her
father quite violently towards the door whilst
she stammered her furious questions, wishes
and commands. “Go down to mother’s
room. Go quickly—no, never mind your
coat go on; go on and see for your-
self !”
He went, and his daughter threw her-
self face downwards on the sofa and
sobbed.
Mrs. Burton, still embroidering, still draw-
ing the long, glowing silken thread in the
blunt needle up to a level with one ear;
beside her chair, his elbow on its arm,
arm, knelt Hubert Webester, his chin rest-
ing on his fist. His pleasant voice was
murmuring.
The amazed husband’s voice? was not
pleasant as he demanded. “What have
you to say to my wife, Mr. Webester? It
must be important to be said on "your
knees.”
The young man turned and rose easily,
without haste or embarrassment. “I was
only on one knee, sir; and it was
rather important. I was entreating your
wife to have John Longstaff paint her
portrait.”
Judge Burton knew his prospective son-
in-law was lying ; and, did he not know, his
wife’s giggle (it was almost a flapper’s
giggle) would have informed him.
Webester left the room as the Judge
crossed the rugs to his wife’s chair and
gazed down at the lady’s face. She glanced
up and gave another girlish laugh.
“Don’t look so astounded, darling,” she
said coolly. “To have men kneeling near my
chair is a commonplace to me now.
You should have seen them in New
Zealand !”
Webester wandered about for a few
minutes looking sulkily for his fiancee. lie
was about to enter the dining-room when a
frilly maid came out, closed the door pur-
posefully behind her and held towards him
an envelope. The young man took it. felt
the enclosure which was not a letter, liesi-
IN OUR TOY-SHOP.
“Whatever is he using such dreadful language for?”
“Oh, he's feeling a hit run-down. Some kid wound him up late
yesterday, and he's been turning somersaults all night.”
tilted a moment, then dropped a ring into liis
waistcoat-pocket.
Y\ itli a sudden briskness he got his hat and
stick, paused an instant at Mrs. Burton’s
sitting-room and stepped within to say good-
bye. But he went no further than the thres-
hold. Judge Burton was in exactly the same
attitude and place near his wife’s chair as
he, Hubert Webester, had been ten minutes
previously.
He passed out into the brilliant sunshine
where the car was waiting for Nurse Osborn.
Meditatively he put his foot on the running-
board. “I’m coming, too,” he told the chauf-
feur.
“I wish to say goodbye, Miss Burton,”
Nurse Osborn said pleasantly to June, who
was seated alone at the lunclieon-table. “I
am getting a train at 2.30. Any letters for
me, addressed either to Olive Pemberton or
Nurse Osborn”
June Burton, her eyelids heavy, her mouth
sullen, had begun a reciprocatory phrase,
but stopped, suddenly enlightened.
“Goodbye,” reiterated Olive. She moved
to the door, but turned round smiling, and
came back a pace or two. “I would like you
to know, late in the day as It is, that my
lace frock was not made of the vicarage cur-
tains.”

Corsets for Bililla.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILILLA’S husband had been dead six
months. All the ceremony of burial
had been observed —the corpse en-
closed in its string not and buried, crouched
upon itself, with the head upon the breast
and paper-bark between the body and the
earth. The death-circle had been cleared
around his grave, the first-night fire had been
lighted near his mound, the meat for the
feast of the dead hung upon a coolabah-tree
without the circle. The women had w 7 orn
the mourning gypsum in the hair; some had
smeared themselves with mud and painted
their bodies red from shoulders to waist.
Superficial cuts had been made on the thighs
of the women and deep incisions in the thighs
of the men. The medicine-men had variously
fixed the cause of death to the bad spirit
Mulkari and to a human enemy from “long-
way country” having pointed the death-bone.
Tbe wounds healed, the mound sank, the
scrub grew in the death-circle, and the ants
took the dead man’s meat from the tree;
the crying and the weeping had run its
course of a fortnight and was forgotten ; the
head mourning of the gins, once masses of
gypsum, lost the whiteness of the kopi and
fell to pieces; and the heart of Bililla was
ready for a new tenant before the conve?:-
tional days of her widowhood were half ex-
hausted.
Eligible parties were few. Bililla. being
a Mauinungo, who must not eat pelican,
whistler duck and black duck, turkey, plain
kangaroo and certain fish, must marry a
Patingo, whose prohibited dietary includes
emu, three kinds of snakes, wallaby, rat.
opossum and mountain kangaroo, so that
their child shall be a Toonbeungo, to whom
whistler and wood duck, native companion,
rat. bandicoot, plain kangaroo and carpet-
snake are prohibited. Such marriage laws
based on food-supply seem as if they would
make for general starvation in time; but it
amounts only to a commandeering of food
not to be infringed under pain of all the
terrors of a flouted religion.
There were two Patingos in the train of
Bililla, and she regarded them with equal
favor. An, official wife had been supplied
to each by the community in general council
assembled ; just as the White Australian at-
taining his majority automatically becomes
an elector of the Commonwealth Mirliament.
But both Patingos—Possum and Eaglehawk,
according to their second baptism in the
branding-yards of Kundi Kundi station, or
Takemoonta and Wollayun in their own lan-
guage—had been absent so long from the
tribe that these official marriages no longer
counted. The law that forced them to marry
whomever the tribal council designated
worked ill among so individualistic a people:
and Possum and Eaglehawk were out seek-
ing in Bililla a permanent wife —not a mere
flirtation of buck and gin, but a permanent
alliance with a woman who should, for one
of them, “altogether stop in gundi.”
Bililla, being a woman, played off one
against the other, so that both in despair
OVER-BATED.
“Most women find grey hairs in a man
demned attractive, what?"
“Yes. Aren't they foolish when it's so easy
to give him a few?"
and rage thought seriously of forcibly taking
the siren and eloping with her. Bililla,
knowing it, was careful to remain within
coo-ee of the gundies. Well she knew that
when eloping lovers return they must run the
gauntlet of the outraged community and the
punishment of stone knives and yamsticks,
of boomerangs and spears.
Naturally, the unexpected butted into the
game. Deera, a gin whose husband had
been a stockman at Kundi Ivundi, became a
widow ; and, throwing off the station’s habit
of dressing when at work in dairy or kitchen
—which dressing she described as “too dam’
hot altogether”—she returned to the tribe,
too old and ugly to be sought after, even
after her twelve-months of widowhood, but an
object of tremendous interest to the women
because she had brought with her a pair of
“white Mary stays.” The fact that she wore
them upside-down, with the inverted sus-
penders falling gently towards the place
where her waist-line would have been had
she had one, was nothing; the fact that they
touched her bulging shape at all points and
exposed where their designer intended them
to conceal, was even less. The tremendous
fascination of these white-Mary stays made
every woman —Patingo, Marinungo and
Toonbeungo—sick with envy, and Bililla
was more envious than all. Though the once
"German silver" of the suspender-clasps
showed the red of rust and the elastic was
worn and frayed, and though a busk or two
had lost its covering and the corset its form,
this new instrument of vanity seemed the
one desirable thing in all the world. But
Deera refused to part with the prize; she
wore them all day and all night, and slept
with one eye open to guard her property.
Furthermore, Deera was the father's
brother's daughter of a man who was a man
“THE BLOOM THAT NEVER FADES"
OLD ('RONY: “ Ou long yer been in the Army, Bill?"
REDORMED CHARACTER (pointing to nose) : “ 'Ardly long enough yet for the blighted
bloom to wear off.”
Of magic, a maker of thunder and lightning,
and an efficient pointer of the death-bone:
and superstitious fear helped' Deera in the
guarding of the white-Mary stays.
Then P.ililla thought of Possum and Eagle-
lmwk, the desperate lovers who waited be-
bore her gundi as if it were the Gate of Para-
dise. They dared anything but tribal law.
Bililla, the six-months-old widow, might of
her own will select a husband; but none
dare steal her until her year of widowhood
was past. So when Bililla said that she
would, marry him who should possess a pair
of white-Mary stays, Possum and Eaglehawk
set themselves to find out the way, Deera’s
corset being as unattainable as the moon;
they left the collection of gundies and “went
bush”—Eaglehawk, a tall, thin man, with a
grizzled beard, towards Leichhardt; Possum,
a round, well-shaped, medium-sized chap, witli
one eye, towards Pookootoo.
So the two hunters of white-Mary stays
separated ; Eaglehawk going on his way with-
out thought or plan, and P’ossum sitting
down by a pandanus belt at Surprise Creek
to think out his method. lie sat there for
half a day. During his thinking he pulled
the seed cases of much grass to pieces, the
while he sang of the man who married two
sisters at the time when the female kan-
garoo s pup was eating the stargrass; of
the picture behind the doctor’s ear, and the
pappa-seed under the coolamon ; and of the
clever man. who kicked the mad woman out
of his gundi. These songs being duly crooned,
Possum had found his method; he walked
swiftly through the grass-tussocks with the
sun declining behind him and a little to the
right-hand, and at Cabbage-tree Creek he
camped on water, but supper less, and slept
till dawn.
He made Pookootoo next afternoon, and
hung about the horse-yards waiting for
night. At a camp near by a kindly team-
ster gave him bread, meat and tea saturated
with sugar for helping with the horses, and
after moonrise Possum prospected around the
hotel, was ordered off and subjected to the
suspicious sniffing and menacing growls of
dogs, and so retreated baffled. But first he
noted that the teamster, apparently anxious
for a change, slept on the front verandah of
the hotel that night.
In the early morning, when the dogs were
sleeping in dark places, and the flies were
about to recognise the moment as the be-
ginning of biting-time. Possum, walking as
lightly over the red earth as a bird descending
on a bough, went around the hotel to the
kitchen, and drew a blank. But in the hang-
ing meatsafe on the back verandah he found
some cold grilled chops and ate them ; and
thus fortified he passed to the end of the
verandah, and, looking through first the
open window and then the half-open door,
he heard much snoring. Peering into the
half-darkness he saw that the snoring pro-
ceeded from the open mouth of a very fat-
woman with a chin of many ripples. A
large, soft, reddened arm as big as Possum’s
thigh was thrown outside the counterpane •
the lady’s breathing made the bed-clothes
move as if a whale were suffocating beneath,
and the snoring seemed to echo among the
unceiled rafters. But Possum had no thought
for.the white Mary. His own black, search-
ing eyes observed the general disposition of
the room at a glance, the bed and its heav-
ing sleeper, the. door propped half-open by
a chair, the lady’s clothing thrown carelessly
on another chair, and then, the Mecca of his
pilgrimage, a very large pair of white-Mary
stays, dirty-white and worn, and with one
suspender hanging down the side of the dress-
ing-table by the bed. The stays were large
enough to embrace two Bilillas: but Possum
did not know that, and if he had known could
have no care therefor. The corsets of the
large cook of Pookootoo represented Bililla:
the.short hair on his shoulders rose with the
excitement of approaching the goal so quickly
and easily; lie. registered the relative posi-
tions of door, chair, the cook and the corsets,
stepped over the chair velvet-footed, leaped
noiselessly to the dressing-table and clasped
the corsets to his breast. As silently he
turned to the door, and in his excitement
struck the chair with his right arm as he
jumped over it.
Then the cook woke. She had a glimpse
of a glistening bronze back—the back of a
black man clad only in a pair of ragged trous-
ers shortened to the knees. She did not see
the corsets, for they were held tightly in
the black man’s arms ; but she saw that he
fled, waited a moment to assure herself that
she had not been murdered and was still
alive, and then made every sheet of the
galvanised-iron of the inn vocal with the
echoes of her screams.
Possum, half-mad with fear, rushed to the
shelter of the distant scrub, having a quarter-
mile of open wooded country to cross before
he reached it. and praying to all the magi-
cians that ever were to disguise him as the
water-hen changed the emu that stole the
water-hen’s eggs—by throwing live ashes over
her and browning her feathers. But he be-
lieved more in work than in faith ; and while
he wished he ran.
The shrieks aroused first the men and
then the dogs, drowsy after the night’s hunt-
ing. The men came out in pyjamas, and
heard the cook’s ravings of the bad black
man who had visited her room and perpetrated
the crowning insult of flight; and they re-
turned to their rooms for their boots. Left
without direction, the dogs stopped, irreso-
lute, hoping for a false alarm. The men re-
turned with boots on, and questioned the
cook, now made respectable by a raincoat
over her nightgown, as to the real offence
of the black man, hoping (in the way of
human nature) for the worst. The cook
could relate only the insult of Possum’s pres-
ence during her orchestration; she could
find nothing in the way of theft; she desired
only punishment for the insult of a walk-
about nigger daring to approach the bower
of a white Mary; and the white men recog-
nised the justice of her claim, and departed
on the deep tracks of the running feet of
Possum. The dogs, now that they had direc-
tion, joined in enthusiastically ; a lean cattle-
man, who could track like a blackfellow,
picked up the tracks on sand, lost them on
wind-swept hard ground, picked them up
again on sand, lost them on flat limestone,
and picked them up again in the dust of a
storm channel.
Meantime, Possum, his heart assaulting
his ribs, had gained the scrub, and ran until
he thought he was safe. Then he heard on
the morning wind, that blows from the east
over the Mitchell and Flinders grass plains
to Pookootoo, the high-pitched yelp of a dog.
At that Possum leaped five feet to the south
and again five feet: hid the cook’s corsets in
a covering of sand, brambles and stones; took
the two five-feet leaps back to his tracks,
carefully joined the tracks so as to hide the
deviation,, and ran on again until safety
seemed certain.
He had rested but a minute when he heard
the yelp of a dog to the north; he took a
few paces west, and another dog yelped
ahead! Southerly was the cache of tlie cor-
sets. and a dog gave tongue there; and east-
ward lay the owner of the stolen white-Mary
stays. He was surrounded. The white men
had horses.
They would not catch him with anything:
he could say he thought the teamster slept
in that room, and that he had retreated on
finding a white Mary. Then a bareback
horse, bearing a man barefoot and in
pyjamas, rode right at him from the north.
Possum threw up his hands, and the horse
almost touched the ground with his rump,
answering to that sudden reining in.
‘‘lon black cow.” said the rider, stooping
from the saddle and clutching the unresist-
ing Possum by the hair, “what for you go
alonga room alonga Pookootoo?”
“I been wantem tellem teamster horse go
all about.” said Possum glibly. “Then ' I
been see one white Mary I run away.”
“You’realiar.”
“My word, all right that one altogether. I
no been know-em white Mary. I been pri-
kened, altogether run away.”
“H’m, I’ll see ! You go front alonga horse
—we go back longa pub.”
The leaden-hearted Possum obeyed, cer-
tain that the lie would be discovered. As
he walked ahead of the horse and his captor,
the dog-yelps came closer, and other horse-
men joined them. He was conducted to the
teamster s camp, there to find accommodat-
ing testimony. _ The teamster had slept in
the hotel the night before; the 'waggon-horses
had strayed over the creek. So the lies of
Possum were duly corroborated. There were
white men there who still doubted him. but
the evidence against them was conclusive;
they contented themselves with brandishine-
whips and one man gave Possum a kick-off
for luck as he departed. Rut the dogs fol-
lowed him menacingly with their teeth bared
and escorted him for a mile through the bush
westward. The dogs did not believe him;
they had no vocabulary to cloud their in-
stinct. and they knew.
Arrived at the turn-off to his cache. Pos-
sum jumped five feet tw T ice to the south, re-
trieved the white-Mary corsets—now the cor-
sets of Rililla—jumped five feet twice to the
north, and ran westward easily but quickly,
at that loping gait a man in training can
or the day. He stayed not at
Cabbage-tree, and crossed Surprise Creek two
miles west of the beaten track. At sundown
lie was but twelve miles or so from the camp
where Bililla waited for the corsets.
At dusk the cook at Pookootoo, who had
worked all day in the kitchen in ease and
without corsets, went to her room to “dress
up” and be smart and uncomfortable for the
evening. It was then that she discovered tlv
loss of the corsets of the one suspender.
Five minutes of a resultless search assured
her of theft. She first blamed the (tugs.
then she thought of the marauder of the
dawn. At that she shrieked again; but
tracks cannot be followed after sundown,
and Possum seemed safe in his journey to
Bililla. But Possum did not know that, and
when early next morning he heard the sound
of galloping hoofs on a hard claypan a few
hundred yards behind him. Possum took
to the bush, and quaked under a great rock
till late in the afternoon. Hence, when he
did reach Bililla’s gundi, his absence had
been four days long. He ran up to the gundi,
the corsets of the fat cook held like a club
in his right hand. The gundi was empty!
Then all the gossips of the tribe came to
him, and told him many things. On the
day he and Eaglehawk had left on the quest
of white-Mary stays, Bililla had used their
absence as liberty to go without the camp.
There she had seen a strange black man.
The gossips thought he was either a Workia
or an Undekerebina, or at least had lived
among such people ; for he sounded a whirler,
or love-charm, outside the camp, and the
gossips had driven him away with stones.
But he had returned, painted with charcoal
from neck to waist, ochred on legs and arms,
with a bunch of grass to his forehead, with
anklets of leaves, and a chaste design of
blood and emu-feathers on the charcoaled
background of his chest. That night Bililla
had disappeared ; and the gossips were quite
certain that “two feller go longway country
altogether.”
Possum put in a day picking up tracks,
and found Bililla’s footprints meeting tin 1
tracks of a man who had waited for her by
a rock—waited a long time, too, for the soft
earth was torn, and trampled by the feet
of impatience; and the impatient stranger
had shifted his weight from one leg to the
other, as the alternately light and heavy im-
pressions testified. So Possum sat down by
the rock cursing Bililla with great bitterness,
remembering the menacing dogs, and the in-
credulous white men, and the fat cook of
Pookootoo who had shrieked while he was
escaping with the white-Mary stays. He.
cursed .all women and all fool-pilgrimages and
Bililla ; but himself he cursed most of all.
THAT SETTLED IT.
“They married purely for business reasons!”
“Did they make a success of it?”
“No! The fools fell in love!”
Having chewed the cud of disillusionment
and found it very bitter, l’ossum. with the
philosophy of diis training, decided to brush
his hand across his forehead and forget.
This he did and was about to return to the
camp, when he saw a man limping stiffly
towards him as if wounded about the hips.
It was Eaglehawk. Possum greeted him
with shouting. Eaglehawk replied faintly:
and then Possum saw that Eaglehawk also
carried a pair of new white-Mary stays slung
at his back, bow-fashion, by a staylace round
his neck.
Sitting down by the rock, Eaglehawk
related his adventures. Coming on a
hawker's waggon, he had seen 'the hawker
sell shirts and trousers to a prospector near
the Place-wherc-the-galah-sits-down, and had
argued therefrom that the hawker’s stock
included white-Mary stays. He had, there-
fore, followed up the waggon for a day and
a half, and turned over the stock next dawn
while the hawker slept. He had found the
corsets ifl a long box, which he discarded
immediately ; but while he fled a dog barked,
the hawker discharged two bai’rels of swan-
shot. and most of the shot found a
place in Eaglehawk’s buttocks! Therefore
these lumps; therefore this- painful way
of walking. Yet adventurers come mostly
home wounded and poor, and was not his case
better, seeing that he had the spoils of the
fight? “Also, thou, my friend Possum, hast
thou had luck?”
Then Possum told the story of Bililla and
the strange man, and the wounded one joined
him in cursing and forgetting her. And
Eaglehawk leaned on Possum on the way to
the camp ; for had they not a bond of union in
the shameless desertion by Bililla, these two
poets and adventurers who had gone to the
ends of the earth—aye, even to the water-
hole at Mobilonga!—to bring gifts to a
queen who had forgotten them for the em-
braces of a scurvy groom? They had placed
Bililla on a pedestal, for their worship and
her safety, and she had voluntarily fallen off
it at the second holding out of the walk-
about stranger’s arms; wherefore they cursed
her fluently and then forgot her.
And to this day the fat cook at Pookootoo
tells the story, and wonders why that black
brute stole her old stays.

Or lush the Spaniard’s wine;
To pay with sullen mintage
Their olden debt of hate
In bullets winged with powder,
And sabres sharp as Fate,
And crude, disturbing cannon
Without the Spaniard’s gate!
Who had been greasy hunters
In green tortugan glades
Soon took their toll of treasure
With buccaneering blades,
Or found their frantic pleasure
With captured Spanish maids.
They crept with trusty cutlass,
At midnight through the trees,
Some shoreward sloop or schooner
With sudden rush to seize,
That they might rape and plunder
The sunlit Caribbees.
They fought in rags or armor—
Small matter wlmt they wore
Who rotted in the forests
Or rallied by the shore,
When oft a hundred rascals
Had dwindled to a score.
They quaffed their burning liquors
In dim-lit tavern ways;
They saw the blue wave glitter
In quiet Indian bays;
Mayhap betimes they uttered
Some shamefaced word of praise.
This coarse and cruel Legion,
Through blood and sweat and grime,
Hath writ a wond’rous story
In letters half-sublime,
With hot, redeeming courage
To gild the leaf of crime.
With pearls and wine a-plenty,
With gold-dust and cigars,
They turned aside in quiet,
Or fell in tavern bars,
Or spat their sinful souls out
Beneath the smoke-blurred stars.
These fierce, freebooting rovers
Who ground the bones of Spain,
Along the hot Bahamas,
Across the Cuban main,
And round the Windward Islands,
Will ne’er to sea again.
No more by green Savannah
They’ll work their landward woes;
No more from far Havana
The dark hull grimly goes
To cruise along Campeachy
Or wait by Barbadoes.
By hemp or steel or bullet.
By sickness or the waves.
They went as rogues—and saints—must
To their appointed graves,
And still by Portobello
The coco gently waves.
And still the wide seas beckon,
And trading ships still come
For their assorted cargoes
In crate and cask and drum,
For sweet West Indian spices
And good Jamaica rum.
NOT ENOUGH WELLNESS TO GO
ROUND.
THE THIN ONE: "Feeling quite well again,
old chap?”
THE STOUT ONE: “Not- much better. Afraid
there is too -much of me to ever be ail
well at once.”
But Bolonois, Bartholomew
And Morgan hard and cold,
With all your fighting companies,
So keen for life and gold,
How fare ye now? Where sail ye now?
What treasures in the hold?
Hush! Lift up your Bibles
And lay down your bowls ’
The night wind mutters,
The sad sea rolls .
A grey fog is rising
Like dead men’s souls !
VICTORIA.

The Murder Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
{DIDN’T want a murder in the kitchen
that night. I was conducting a mur-
der of my own in the dining-room.
In fact, I had most successfully murdered
three victims, and was plotting upon whom
the shadow of the crime should fall, when
there came a strange tapping on the glass
of the door which leads from the dining-room
to the verandah and so to the kitchen. 1
sat still. I was all alone. Nothing stirred
in the house save the children's breathing
and a creaking board. I attributed the
tapping on the pane naturally to my own
genius; it had been created by the power of
my pen. I had murdered my victims most
satisfactorily. The tapping continued. I
would, of course, put the blame of the deed
THEIR POOR CHOICE.
PEARL: “Mamma, if I yet married, will I have a husband like papa?”
MOTHER : “Yes, dear.”
PEARL: “An’ if I don’t marry, must I be an old maid like A uilt Jane?”
MOTHER: “Yes, dear.”
PEARL: “Mamma, we women don’t get many chances in this world, do ice?”
on my innocent heroine, first. That is
always done. Then the muscles at the
back of my neck gave a painful .jerk. A
feeling as if a snake was crawling about
my backbone froze me.
But when you are alone with fear you
learn how to manage the sensation. Also,
and again naturally, I was an expert at
despatching murderers, burglars and petty
interlopers like that. I; knew how to deal
with all such things. I made up my mind
that Lady Doris should be accused of mur-
dering my three victims first. Lady Doris
Was at the golf-links and the three murdered
Chinamen were on the road between Grassby
Lodge, her home, and the golf-links. My
editor insisted upon murders. To him mur-
ders meant action. Of course I knew I was
working up the fear. A murderer like my-
self has to do that. Lady Doris had just
met her Algy on the links. She was lean-
ing on a golf-stick and had not the remotest
idea that she had murdered the three China-
men.
Her dear little mamma was just about to
discover them when I became aware that the
tapping on the glass of the door was neither
a beetle nor a snake. Human fingers were
agitatedly beating there. What could it be
ait this hour of the night? Who could it
be? I had left Aunty in the kitchen cutting
up lemons for jam. You begin to under-
stand the psychology of fear when you have
committed as many murders as I have —
sometimes four a week, usually Chinamen
and foreigners. My editor strictly forbids
me to murder Australians. So I under-
stood by this that the tapping fingers be-
longed to a woman. Also she was afraid.
I suppose I should mention Alf. He reports
on one of the city newspapers, and while I
was worrying over the Chinamen I had mur-
dered he was chasing down one of those
beastly real murders that had just happened
in Campbell-street or Surry Hills somewhere.
Alf’s never happy unless lie’s got a murder
at the end of his pen. The city murder was
keeping him in town : hence my loneliness.
I thought that Lady Doris, in her red golfer,
might be turned into a villain ess with care-
ful handling, -when the tapping became much
more insistent. But I knew there was no
need to move yet. It is a very difficult
thing to dispose of three bodies after one has
murdered them —even if they are Chinamen.
And now I was feeling that Lady Doris’s
dear little mamma ought not to discover the
bodies. What on earth would Ido with her
there on the road to the links in a faint?
Of course her chmiffeur might be accused of
the murders. There are always possibili-
ties in a chauffeur.
The house suddenly shook and creaked.
Rats scampered over the rafters. I put my
pen down uneasily and left Lady Doris tap-
ping her teeth with the handle of her club in
meditation while Algy proposed, dear little
mamma stepping into her car and the ex-
posed bodies of my victims in the dark wood.
Then I clenched my hands and swallowed
hard. .
As I said to begin with, I didn't want a
murder in the kitchen that night. Alt and
I had taken what'we. called the Bush House
purposely to get atmosphere for his crime
stories. . lie was writing up a series of old
murders and mysteries which lie intended
publishing at the end of the year, and we
had come to this place for atmosphere. In
the gully below us a tree -was marked with
an arrow. A ‘convict who escaped from a
Bathurst-road gang years ago murdered his
pursuer there and got away. That was just
below us. Half a mile from our back gate,
if you walked towards Bathurst, you came to
a rock beneath which Avere sand and stones
in the form of a cross marking the grave of
a murdered man. You could stand on the
spot from which the: A'ietim had been shot.
It was a beautiful rock, covered with the
names of sightseers who had made a pil-
grimage to the place. Alf had snapned me
standing on the spot. I bad snapped him.
So we had just the right atmosphere for
Alf’s crime stories.
My heart had never thumped so violently
as it did when I put my pen down. A pen
is not a knife, but it has a mate-like feeling.
Alf’s revolver, loaded for action, was in what
we called the Murder Room. That is the
room where I type out my stories and put
the final touches to all my murders. We
had been advised to get the revolver, not
because the house was haunted, but because
the Skeleton Hut. some little distance from
us in the bush, was nearly always occupied
by someone the police in Sydney were want-
ing. We often entertained a murderer at
the back door. Alf liked it. Ilis paper
wanted that sort of crime. Many a time
I have held converse on the steps with a
thug who had put an ordinary policeman in
hospital. We were not far from the rail-
way line; neither was the Skeleton Hut.
This made the neighborhood convenient.
Trains could be watched for the arrival of
police, detectives and rangers. I suppose
my first-hand knowledge of real criminals
makes my handling of Lady Doris and her
confederates the trouble it is sometimes.
But Alf would not have left me alone at
night at all had we not had Aunty. Now,
however, as my heart beat faster, I began to
suspect Aunty—poor old thing! I also sus-
pected Aunty’s nephew for the first time
since I had known him. He was working for
Alf in a general way. His name was Ted
Johnstone, and when he had been cutting
wood and mending fences for us for a little
while he brought over
a Mrs. Johnstone,
whom he called Liz,
and lent her to me
once a week for seven
shillings. She washed
and scrubbed an d
ironed for me. She
was very satisfactory.
Alf and I, devoted to
our mutual crimes
and murders, decided
to adopt Mr. and Mrs.
Johnstone. We gave
hi m permission t o
build a bark home near
us, and we were all
very happy, I murder-
ing joyously seven
times a week or so,
Alf freshening up all
the old spilt blood of
past crimes, and the
Johnstones at onr
elbow ready to do any-
thing for us.
It worked very well
until Ted disappeared
for a few days, and
Liz w r as visited by a
brother from Tas-
mania. Then Liz
went away with her
brother, and Ted re-
turned with Aunty.
He presented the old
woman as his aunt,
and she looked so
friendly and aunty-
like we accepted her.
Ted confessed that Liz
had gone to Long Bay.
Alt’s puls e s leaped
with delight. He
asked as anxiously
after Liz as if she
had been a long-lost
friend. Liz had been
“run-in” for hitting a man over the eye with
a bottle and stealing a pound from a blind
soldier. So ran Ted’s story. lie wept about
Liz. He was a long man and his tears
made spray when they fell.
His Aunty, he said, would do for me what
Liz had done. She did everything much
better; but she was afraid to remain in the
two-roomed hut with her nephew. Ted
suggested the Skeleton Hut, but it was not
ready yet, and meantime there was nowhere
else for her to sleep but on the verandah.
Alf put up a bed for her. He was rubbing
his hands with joy; for he scented real copy
when Liz returned from her rest.
Alf had no fear about the honesty of Ted
and Aunty. Neither had I until I realised
that I was alone in the night with them. I
left the table noiselessly arid peered through
the window. There was no light in Ted's
hut: but there was a fire burning in the
Skeleton Hut, which was beyond Ted’s
in the distance. I knew this meant that the
aboriginals were back. They consisted of a
black man, a white woman, a child and a
man neither black nor white who was being
hunted by the police. My throat throbbed.
Alt's ridiculous revolver was one of those
absurd automatic things. I was within
screaming distance of the railway station,
but suppose Ted and Liz and Aunty and
the group in the Skeleton Hut were all
working together? There was nothing much
to steal in the house; but suppose they were
all the worse for liquor—suppose they liked
murdering people!
The tapping had ceased for a second, but
it now occurred again. If it were Aunty
surely the old idiot would call. I left the
window, after hesitating as to whether I
should make a dash for the railway station,
or wake young Alfie and send him over, or
just scream. I did none of these things,
owing, no doubt, to my own genius at handling
these criminal cases. Murdering is my living,
of course. 1 tiptoed noiselessly towards the
hall door, passing the Murder Room, where
on the shelf was Alf’s revolver. I paused
and heard a scuffle of feet. No one but a
trained murderer would have heard those
steps. They came back and fingers rapped
at the door again. Instinct told me at once
that “the traveller knocking on the moonlit
door” was Aunty. 1 opened it cautiously.
It was she. She had left her lemons and
come to me.
“She’s come back,” Aunty whispered. “Liz.
My nephew’s gone to drown himself in the
creek. She is going to murder me.”
“Very well,” I said in my most matter-of-
fact way. “go back into the kitchen and fin-
ish cutting up the lemons for the jam. Re-
member, Miss Johnstone, you are being
employed by me.”
I always called her Aunty; but the “Miss
Johnstone” arrested her.
“Very well, ma’am,” she said, shuffling
back to the kitchen. It was the first time I
had noticed that she shuffled; and I thought
I knew what the shuffle meant. I softly
closed my hall door as she disappeared into
the kitchen; then I stood in the hall and
clenched cold hands. Ted had gone to drown
himself; Liz was going to murder Aunty;
Aunty was sitting in the kitchen cutting up
lemons and quietly waiting to be murdered.
I had practically ordered her to go back and
be murdered. Really, it was very interest-
ing. Quite a plot.
“Lady Doris and Algy could quarrel over
the golf club,” I said to myself, being the
thorough business woman I am, “or dear
little mamma could go mad when she sees
the murdered Chinamen and drown herself.
Thcre'd have to be a creek handy, of course.”
I walked deliberately back to my table and
took up my pen; but Aunty sitting there
waiting to be murdered, Liz selecting her
weapon and Ted going off to commit suicide
had a disturbing effect on me. I began to
hum, “Yes, we have no bananas,” very
jauntily, and went again to the hall door,
which I opened. I crossed the verandah to-
wards the kitchen and paused with a shudder
of alarm. Through the closed window 1
could see Aunty cutting up our large Lisbon
lemons with a carving knife. Her teeth were
clenched. She had iron-grey hair, a matronly
plump figure, a kind oval face and a not
unpleasant smile. But cutting up the lemons
grimly she looked like some terrible fate.
The mere sight of lemons always puts my
teeth on edge. But I could almost feel her
cutting the thin slices with the large sharp
knife as if each slice were a bit of my own
flesh. She had the carving knife ready for
Liz, T could see. I almost screamed; but,
instead, ignoring the sensation of my teeth on
SHE WAS ONLY H IS WIFE.
“Oh, I say — you’re all right with me, you know; but how would
you get at your money if you were with anyone else?”
“If I was with anyone else I wouldn’t need to get at my money.”
edge, and the nasty feeling of cutting flesh,
and the lemons, and Aunty’s face and the
gleaming carving knife, I went into the kit-
chen.
“How are you getting on?” I said.
Aunty looked up. She stammered a little.
“Only half a dozen more,” she said. “My
word, my daughter will be pleased if I
take her a pot of jam made by her mother.”
“You must take a couple of pots,” I said,
determined to do the thing well. "I low old
is your daughter? I didn’t know you were
married.”
“Yes, I’ve been married often,” she replied.
Then quickly: “I’ve had three husbands. Do
you think my. nephew will drown himself
for that awful woman?”
“No." I said. "I shouldn’t worry.”
Then we heard a sound as of a dog
scratching at the shut kitchen door at the
back.
“That’s her. that’s her,” said Aunty, spring-
ing up, with the carving-knife in her hand.
(Continued on page 18.)


"1 11 go out of this door. Don’t let her
know I’m here. She’ll think I’ve gone.”
I didn’t know whether i.iz had a carving-
knife, a gun _or a common bottle. She
scratched again. Lady Doris chewing her
golf-stick and the Chinaman waiting to be
discovered by dear little mamma scarcely
had me in a fix like this —Aunty lurking
about on the verandah with her carving-
knife and Liz at the door with a bottle, may-
be. I was between death and death. I did
not know what the women meant between
them by this time.
I turned to the basin of finely-cut lemons
which Aunty had just left, and, removing
one of the rings, began to nibble at it as I
approached the door outside which Liz
waited. Then I opened the door, continu-
ing to eat the lemon ring. It was like
eating the raw blade of a knife wet with
blood. Liz stood there swaying in the moon-
-11 Sht> one hand behind her back. She was
a slight, stringy, scraggy little woman with
a long, red face, a mat of niggery frizzy
hair and a mouth that had been hit almost
out ot shape. Her left eye was black. When
young Alfie had seen Liz first his childish
comment to us had been, “I don't like the
look of her face.” Her face had that sort
ot look sober. Now it was inflamed with
bad liquor and it had a sinister expression.
Good-night,” she said to me. Her flowery
hat fell to one side as she spoke.
Good-night,” I replied. There was a'
slight pause. I smacked my Ups over the
sour lemon-ring and hoped that she had not
a bottle behind her back, because I could see
she wanted to nit something.
“Could you oblige me with a box of
matches?” she said.
Certainly. I had only to reach my hand
I°. Bm shelf behind the door. This 1
did, giving her the matches and compressing
my lips tighter over the sourness of the
lemon juice. She received the matches sus-
piciously. Her eyes narrowed.
"Is there anything else you want?” I
asked.
"No, thanks.”
She withdrew, moving backwards. I closed
(he door and the interview was over. Auntv
was at the door leading to the kitchen from
urn verandah, the carving-knife flashing in
the lamp-nguc.
“Is she gone?” she whispered.
Yes,” I said. “Finish those lemons, like
a good soul, and get to bed.”
Aunty did as she was told, somewhat sul-
lenly.
“You’re cutting them up beautifully,” I
said, to please her. “I can almost see
through the nieces.”
“Yes. I’ve got a beautiful daughter,” she
replied. “She’ll like to get some of her
mother s jam.”
“By the way, I’ve never asked you,” I
interrupted, as she compressed her lips and
cut at the lemons again, “what is your real
name?”
My last husband’s name was Jamieson,”
she said.
Then I must call you Mrs. Jamieson ” I
said.
"Don’t let Ted—don't let my nephew hear
you, was her reply. “My daughter married
a very cruel man. But she’ll like to have
some of her mother’s jam.”
“Have you never made jam before?”
“Oh, yes. Often, at the hospital.”
“What hospital?”
She named St. Alban’s, a well-known men-
tal hospital, where she said she had been
a cook. I left her with the lemons.
It wasn't my fault she was there \|f
took her in because Ted said she often kept
house for him. She looked
respectable. She was a won-
derful cook. By the time I
got back to Lady Doris, how-
ever. 1 was beginning to
think that Aunty was pro-
bably mad, Liz a criminal of
the worst type, and Ted no
better. It was the wrong
atmosphere altogether for
Lady Doris. I couldn't get
on with the yarn. I ought,
besides, to have been con-
cerned about Ted. But I
was not. I picked up the
paper and began n> read an
account of the murder Alf
was chasing in the city that
night. Alf’s pen becomes
sticky with blood when he
has seen his victim. The
murderer was at large, as he
generally is in a real crime.
It appears that some poor
girl had been found stabbed
in a house in Surry Hills.
It is usual enough to find
a girl stabbed there; but
this girl was dead, and there
was no clue at all for the
police to follow up. Alf was
working for his paper like
a bloodhound on the scent.
He wanted to be in first
when the criminal was
caught. Wasting his time
over a sickening job like that
when be might have been
helping me despatch my
Chinamen and decide whether
Lady Doris should go mad
before she married Algy or
afterwards, and how I could
link Algy up with the vic-
tims in the. dark wood!
A sudden scream of voices
in hot argument brought me
back to the murder which I
didn’t want in the kitchen
that night.
Now, the scream is always
important to a murder. The
scream usually takes place
before the death of the victim. Being, besides
a business woman. Alt's wife. I knew tlie
value of copy with the blood wet on it.
Someone was neing murdered at my very
door. I might just as well witness the deed
in Alt’s interests, my own and the interests
of my editor, who was particular about what
he called “local color.” I hurried outside
to find Aunty wiping the carving-knife.
“What is all the row about?” I said to
her.
Instead of telling me she began to clean
the carving-knife. Then when she spoke she
said. “My daughter is very unhappy with
her husband ; but she'll be very proud of her
mother’s jam.”
A woman’s voice screamed into the mght,
THE SURF SIREN.
“You did ! You did !” I knew Liz’s voice.
I opened the back door and listened.
I was disgusted. No one was being mur-
dered. Ted was not even drowning himself.
He and Liz were enjoying an ordinary row.
“You’ll soak the fruit, won’t you?” I
said to Aunty, and picked up a basin of
scraps which I intended taking down to Ted’s
dog.
“Yes, ma’am,” she said. “My word, if I
were my nephew I’d settle that woman !”
“Y r ou go to bed,” I replied.
“Is the boss home yet?”
“No. He’ll be here by the next train.”
The next train was seven hours away, and I
could feel myself very satisfactorily disposed
of long before Alf’s train arrived. Lady
Doris was choked with her golf-sticks for the
night as far as I was concerned; so I
walked leisurely to the Johnstone hut with
the dog-food. When the fighting voices lulled
I called out casually: “Are you there, Mr.
Johnstone? I’ve brought some scraps for
the dog.’
“Come in,” said Liz.
I went in. I’d never have let Lady Doris
walk into a trap like that; but I had the
IN THE DROUGHT BELT.
“I suppose the cuts hare told you I'm a grass-widow ?”
“That is all. right. I’m from the West myself and looting for
agistment.”
dog's food to protect me, and I took up
n bone and tapped it on the .side of the basin
as I surveyed Liz. She was standing with
folded arms glaring at Ted. lie was sitting
on a box filling his pipe. They had the walls
of their but very tastefully decorated with
newspaper prints, and just behind Ted
I saw the familiar pictures of the bodies of
some of my own murdered victims which Ted
had cut out of newspapers I had given him.
I leaned against the door feeling quite at
home. I even thought how pleased Ted
would be to paste up Lady Doris and the
three murdered Chinamen. Then without
any warning I asked. “Where can I put the
dog-food ?”
Liz took it from me quietly enough and
set it on top of the sewing machine. The
hut was spotlessly clean—the floor cemented.
Liz lurched as she took the basin and I
asked, “Aren’t you well, Mrs. Johnstone?”
“Well? Well?” she replied, glancing from
me to Ted aggressively. “Well? Coming
home here to find a thing like that”—point-
ing to my house—“in the hut?”
“What’s the matter with Mr. Johnstone’s
aunt?” I asked.
“Aunt? Aunt?” she shrilled. “She ain’t
his aunt.”
“She is,” shot in Ted, crossing one leg over
the other and lighting his pipe. “She is.”
Down on her knees went Liz. She bumped
so hard I lost my presence of mind for a
second and looked astonished. But as soon
as she flung back her head, lifted her eyes to
the ceiling, thrust out her arms wildly and
cried, “Gawd be a witness, she’s out of
Campbell-street or my name ain’t what it is,”
I felt as Ted felt, puffing unconcernedly at
his pipe and never once glancing at her.
Liz —her scene over—came up to her feet
and took the stage again. "Wliat’s my
life to be now? Gwendoline May coming up
here with her husband in the morning for
'im to find ’er mother turned out for Liz from
Campbell-street. ’Er your aunt?”
Gwendoline May’s name made me smooth
back my hair in perplexity.
“She is my aunty,” was all Ted would
reply doggedly, “and I never knew you was
coming out so soon nor that the daughter
was coming up.”
“You never knew?” Liz turned from him
to me. “Wot am I going to say to Gwendo-
line May? Her husband’ll be able to chuck
it up to ’er all ’er life and say, ‘Look what
your mother was.’ 1 don’t care wot ’e does”
—meaning Ted—“but he needn’t ’ave brought
that sort of thing about when Gwendoline
May was coming up. That ‘aunty’ of ’is
’as been in a lunatic asylum.”
But I was interested in Gwendoline May.
“Who is Gwendoline May?” I asked.
Liz folded her arms placidly. "The daugh-
ter.” she said.
“Whose daughter?”
“Mine. And she and her husband told me
they’d be up by the last train to-night.”
My murdered victims seemed to rise up
very suddenly just then and mock me. Two
more of the band were coming, and I alone!
I took up the dog-food and put it down
again. Ted smoked in silence. Perhaps it
was his beautiful indifference that wooed
these women.
“Well, you mustn’t make a noise about the
place,” I said in command, “and you mustn’t
upset yourself. Mrs. Johnstone. I shall not
allow Miss — Mrs. —Aunty to annoy you.”
We left it at that.’ I went back to Aunty,
who was putting her hair in curling-papers
and preparing herself solemnly for bed. She
may have been only 50; but she looked 60
then.
“I think I'd better go in the morning."
she said. “I couldn't stand being about
with her; and my daughter will be glad to
see me.”
“Very well.”
The murder being now postponed inde-
finitely, I went back to Lady Doris and
Algy for a moment, but I could do no more
than take the golf-sticks from Lady Doris’s
teeth. I went to bed. The bedroom is just
off the verandah, and some time early in the
morning I was awakened by a call of “Rail-
way speaking." I ought to have shrieked
at the sound of the voice; but the railway
is the protection of the bush. I slipped on
a dressing-gown and came out on the veran-
dah. Two shadowy forms stood in the
garden beside the railway official. “Mrs.
Johnstone’s daughter and son-in-law are
looking for their hut,” he said.
I told them the way. Gwendoline May
stepped a little into the light of the torch
the official was holding. She was a pretty
girl in a yellow golfer; and she was leaning-
on the arm of a gallant young man. I
directed them casually through the garden,
and took a glance at Aunty’s bed before I
returned to my own. She was not in the
bed! I peered through the kitchen window
and saw her curled up grimly on some bags
on the floor. She had securely locked lier-
self into the kitchen away from Liz. J-he
lemons soaked in the light of dawn.
I got Aunty to make the jam before sue
left next day. It was Sunday, and there
was no train till evening. Alf had not come
home, but all was quiet at the Jolmstoues
hut. Aunty took a couple of pots of jam
away for her beautiful daughter.
“Perhaps you’d like to take some flowers,
too?” I suggested.
“No,” she said, still very solemnly. Ao,
thank you. But if I could have a red, rose
for myself I’d be much obliged to you.
"Take what you want,” I said.
She picked a blood-red rose and shuffled
away with the jam.
I was murdering merrily when Alt came
home. He was intoxicated with pure, joy
and tumbled his notes out. He had written
his report for his paper; but he was so
thrilled that he meant to write the whole
story as a special.
“It’s been great, great!” he said. “How’s
the yarn?”
“They’ve found the murderer, I suppose.”
“Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!”
I knew by that inspired remark that Alf
must not be harassed for details yet, nor
could I explain my difficulties in removing
the bodies of my victims from the dark wood
before dear little mamma arrived, and the
golf-stick from Lady Doris’s mouth. Bui
when the children were sound asleep, tea
over and all the air pregnant with phantom
creakings and the right atmosphere for crime
about, Alf and I got down to our murders.
“If little mamma suddenly lost her hand-
kerchief or her memory, and the three mur-
dered Chinamen were moved nearer the golf-
links” I was beginning earnestly, when
Alf ran his hand through his hair and
stamped with his foot.
“Please don’t interrupt me, dear,” he said,
“and you can’t use the lost-memory motive
again.”
"But who murdered the Chinamen?” I
protested.
Alf wrote on heedlessly.
“Their firm opinion is,” lie shot in, “this
girl was killed by her own mother.”
“Ilow tame!” I said. “But do you think
Lady Doris should”
“Be quiet about Lady Doris. No. I’ve
got these rooms mixed up. The girl’s body
was found in the kitchen.”
“Good Lord! I know, Alf; I'll resurrect
those three Chinamen for the moment, bring
back Lady Doris from the links, and at
half-past two”
“Nine o’clock! It was nine o'clock. Oh.
poor soul! You know, they’ll get her, my
dear.”
“Who? Lady Doris?”
“Oh, shut up about Lady Doris,” said
Alf, very politely, banging the table with
his fist. “The mother of the murdered girl,
of course. Don’t you know the police have
got the clue —the clue”
“No, I don't. I haven’t got my clue. I’m
not going to have three murdered Chinamen.
I'm going to murder dear little mamma in-
stead. She's old. I’ll put the blame on
Lady Doris. And Algy will”
“I don’t think they’ll hang the old woman.
She’s only just been released from St.
Alban’s.”
“Yes, yes. That’d be a good idea,” I said.
“Lady Doris can escape from a mental hos-
pital, murder dear little mamma, put the
blame on Algy and the three Chinamen”
“In the name of. .. . My dear, will you
please shut up. My victim was really mur-
dered—by her own mother. The police are
sure, because I pointed out a faded red
rose in the room when I was permitted for
press purposes to witness the scene of the
tragedy. That red rose is the clue. The
murdered girl's mother always wore a red

The Pied Piper.
THERE’S no dark form on the chaff-bags curled
Though paddocks under the dawn are white;
No barking mass through the slip-rails whirled
And after the farthest milkers hurled;
No gliding arrow of black and tan
The heel of an obstinate cow to bite;
The sun comes up on a dogless world
For the travelling circus left last night,
And Lassie and Rover, Spot and Fan
Have all gone after the circus van.
The circus isn’t a flash affair-—
Just a mangy mule and a couple of goats,
A thin “fat woman,” a piebald pair,
And a wheezy organ that wits declare
Is the only one the district knows
To be utterly wrong in all the notes;
But out on the innocent, country air
Some subtle enticement slyly floats,
Some tune that tickles the canine toes,
For the dogs all follow where’er it goes.
Maybe ’tis the scent of the stews that cook
On a fire of pickets from someone’s fence;
Or the tattered tent may chance to look
Like the opening page of a wondrous book
That dogs must study whene’er they can;
Perhaps ’tis the spruiker’s eloquence
Luring them on by hook or crook;
Or are they just, with their faith immense,
The prey of illusion (yes, like man!)
That they glimpse romance in a circus van?

Combo’s Dream.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Combo's hair was lank and white,
His limbs were stiff and bent;
And worn and tattered were the bags
That served him for a tent.
His bed of withered gum-leaves spread
Was mouldy with the damp ;
His sunken eyes were filmed and dim
Where pain had left its stamp.
He knew the end was coming now,
That he must die alone,
And racked his mind in vain to find
Who held the pointing bone.
And then lie slept and dreamt that he
Was king throughout the land ;■
And calm and deep was Combo's sleep,
For Death was close at hand.
There in his dream a mighty stream,
Foam-crested like the sea,
Mode high above the river banks
In surging majesty;
Ho heard the giant gum-trees crash
And wallow in the mud ;
The creeks came racing down the hills
To join the river’s flood.
He saw his tribesmen of the hills
In thousands camping there;
He sniffed the scent of roasting meat
Far blown upon the air.
He heard the women’s droning croon,
The piccaninnies’ cry;
They’d brought the camps from flooded ground
And pitched them high and dry.
And through the day came many men
From far to join the throng,
The strong and great with swinging gait
Singing a hunting song;
Begreased and decked in gay array
Of gleaming bones and shells
That clinked and tinkled as they moved
Like myriads of bells.
The women and the old men trudged,
A rabble, in the rear;
And as they came they slaughtered game
And packed it with their gear.
The bush was rich in fish and fowl
And all things good to eat;
And on the trees the native fruit
Was plentiful and sweet.
The emus, strutting jauntily,
Pecked here and there for food;
A mother-bird was in the lead
Surrounded by her brood.
But soon they scurried through the bush,
For whirring sharp and clear
In graceful swerve and sweeping curve
Came boomerang and spear.
He heard the curlew’s mournful call,
The eerie screaming kite,
The plaintive cry of passing swans,
Sad pilgrims of the night.
The fire of sandalwood blazed high,
And flamed on log and tree
Half through the night to mark and light
The wild corroboree.
The women stood or gathered wood,
And some were good to see,
But there was one that gazed on him
And smiled bewitchingly;
No yamsticks were her shapely limbs,
Though she was tall and slim,
With laughter lurking in her eyes
That seemed to challenge him.
He was no humble, pleading swain ;
She owned him lord and chief,
And as he hauled her to his camp
She trembled like a leaf.
He saw their children come and go,
Then shivered with the cold
(Chill was the wind, the fire was out,
He was alone and old).
His dream passed on to. cattle-camps '
And flocks that crossed the plains,
When white men’s rum had sent the blood
Mad racing through his veins....
He slumbered while the sun came up
And till it sank in death.
So calm and deep was Combo’s sleep
He did not draw a breath.

JIM GRAHAME.
The Metempsychosis of
Micky Maple.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF I had not met, a few days after return-
ing home to Adelaide on furlough, a
few old pals, and if we had not dined
particularly well, this story would never
have been written. That very good dinner
HE'D MISSED THEM.
“You know you. like talkative women as well
as the other kind.”
“What other kind?”
made us select the Tivoli to finish the even-
ing in, as no other sort of entertainment,
we felt, would suit our occasions. It
was the usual show: a fat danseuse, a
comedian from the States, a man and wife
who exchanged patter. Still, it was cheer-
ful and we were in the right condition to
enjoy it. And then the Indian juggler came
on.
The sight of that long face, with its
deep-sunk, glittering eyes and the symmetri-
cal pattern of creases which started from
the inner corners of the eyes and hung in
loops under the cheek-bones and round the
mouth and thin nostrils, sobered me con-
siderably. I had good cause to remember
that face. It was associated in my mind
very painfully with the terrible night in
Java when Micky Maple passed out so
shockingly. My best pal. I don’t suppose
THE SPREAD OF HUMANE IDEAS.
FIEAT COCKY (addressing mates) : “Strike me pink! That's the first bloke I ever seen
shout fer a motor-car!”
you could find a better chap than Micky
Maple. In quarters he was a treasure, and
when he returned from leave in Adelaide
with a wife, we felt that he had betrayed
us. Especially as, after the first excitement
over a new female addition to our little
circle had subsided, we decided unanimously
that she wasn’t worthy of him. She was a
little thing with regular features and even
more regular habits, but she hadn't an idea
in her pretty head. Except her dread and
dislike of the natives. She was obviously
out of sympathy with her undisciplined
environment. She didn't like our free and
easy ways. She' was afraid of her Servants
and hated their haphazard methods. Sim
was afraid, when Micky was on duty, of her
rambling bungalow. She was even afraid
to walk alone in the big, disordered garden,
which Micky liked because it was as untidy
as the jungle.
She hadn’t been long in Banyuwangi be-
fore she relapsed into a state of resentful
boredom, of mute hostility to her new des-
tiny. Micky, whose hearty volubility always
filled in the blanks of other people, never
saw anything of this. He worked day and
night to keep her happy, and because lie
was himself always in a state of boisterous
jubiliation he believed he succeeded.
That year was the wettest wet monsoon
anybody could remember. It rained all day
and every day and half the night. In the
old days we would have made nothing of
that. Micky and I would have gone out
every afternoon for our usual walk with
the rain drumming on our helmets and beat-
ing through our thin white drills on to our
thirsty skins, and exulted in the madness
of the elements. Now, however, Micky
stayed at home and imagined he was making
his wife forget the weather by playing to
her on his guitar and singing the coon-songs
that had delighted us in quarters in a dozen
different stations.
Things without Micky Avere terribly dull
in the staff mess, so w r e were glad when one
morning a couple of ragged Indian jugglers
with their usual shoddy outfit turned up
and offered their services. One of them, a
tall chap, struck me as the ugliest Hindu I.
had ever seen. He did all the talking, in
the usual jargon of the trade. They had the
customary forged references from the Gov-
ernor of Hong Kong, the Hippodrome in
Berlin and the Crystal Palace in London.
I fancy somewhere in India there must be
a university for jugglers, with chairs of all
the languages up to three, and the biggest liar
in Pagandom as chancellor.
We arranged an entertainment that even-
ing on the verandah of the billiard-room.
Luckily, for the first time, for weeks, the
rain held off, and it was a hot but bright,
still and starry night when our guests
arrived. We had arranged > our armchairs
in a wide semi-circle around the jugglers,
with Micky and his wife in the place of
honor in the centre. The jugglers produced
their usual mouldy repertoire of tricks. They
made a mango-tree grow under a dirty
white cloth from a seed into a pathetic-
looking shrub, and they brought out a
dishevelled cobra which waggled its dusty
head to the accompaniment of the reedy
piping of the smaller man. The tall juggler
got into a basket, his body bulging out the
sides, and his colleague drove a sword to
and fro between his ribs, withdrawing -it
very realistically bloodstained, and then
jumping into the basket on top of the sup-
posed corpse. ,
The performance was a huge success and
we all cheered like mad. especially at the
taller man, who kept up a continual flow of
patter in fragments of a dozen different
tongues. Micky’s fat sides shook with merri-
ment, but Mrs. Maple sat with a look of
slightly supercilious boredom on her pretty
face, doubtless thinking of the more intel-
lectual entertainment provided by the Reper-
tory Theatre in her native city.
The final feat, the great stunt, was a trick
none of us had ever seen before. A large
stone encased in a net was produced and
placed on the floor. We tested it, of course,
and it was heavy enough to require con-
siderable effort to lift. Two cords with
small metal tabs on their ends extended from
the net. The tall juggler, he who had pro-
vided all the patter, picked up the tabs
and, turning back his eyelids, inserted the
tabs underneath. You could see the lids
bulging. Emerging from the outer corners
of the eyes were the cords whose ends were
fastened to the net.
It was an unpleasant sight. Mrs. Maple
obviously hated it, and would, I think, have
asked to go home if it hadn't been for the
fact that a vast black cloud had blotted out
the stars and it could be seen that rain was
coming.
To make the moment
more dramatic, the musi-
cian set up a shrill piping.
“Oh, my ! Juggler! Satu,
dua, tiga, een, twee, drie,
one, two, three,” chanted
the tall man ; then throw-
ing back his head he lifted
the stone, apparently with
the muscles of the eye-
balls, a few inches off the
floor and tottered towards
us.
At that moment a ter-
rific clap of thunder, a
sort of convulsive bellow
that shook the building,
broke overhead, and at
the same time the light
failed. In the flash of
lightning that followed we
all saw the juggler pitch
suddenly forward and col-
lapse at Micky’s feet. The
rain was falling on the
roof in a continuous dron-
ing roar, but above the
awful shindy I could hear
Mrs. Maple shrieking
like a steam calliope.
Working in the flashes
of lightning we got Mrs.
Maple out of her fit of
hysterics, and then turned
our attention to the jug-
gler. He was in a sort
of trance, and it was hard
to ■ say at first if he were
dead or alive. Nobody
had any time to take stock
of impressions, but all the
time I had a queer pic-
ture at the back of my
head of Micky Maple ; to
me it seemed that he had
not moved. With each
flash I seemed to see his
big frame encased in stiff
white drills still in the
comfortable position he
always adopted in the
evenings, his legs extended
on the arms of his chair,
his head resting against
the cane back, and his
eyes twinkling humor-
ously through half-closed lids at the
exciting things that were going on in front
of him. Inactivity wasn’t a bit like Micky,
who had always been first in the fray when
anything was doing.
As soon as the electric light had been re-
stored, I had a look at him. He was dead!
Stone-dead, with his quizzical smile still on
his lips! Heart-failure, they said.
Of course, that finished me for Java. I
never wanted to see the place'again. Mrs.
Maple went back to Adelaide as soon as she
had sufficiently recovered from the shock,
and I got my furlough a few months after.
When I saw across the footlights the long
face of that infernal juggler, who in the con-
fusion of Micky’s passing out had been
carried away by his companion and had
never been seen by us again, it all came back
to me. It made me sick, and when I saw
that he had observed me and was staring
across the footlights at me with what seemed
to be recognition in bis eyes, I felt sicker
than ever. All the time in the midst of his
crazy monologue his big dark eyes kept turn-
ing towards me, and somehow I fancied
they had an expression of dumb appeal in
them.
Perhaps it was the drinks or perhaps it
was that look, but when lie called for a
helper from the audience for one of his
tricks, to my own astonishment I found my-
self on the stage, staring foolishly at the
audience and holding a stick he bad giyen
me by each end. The juggler was standing
behind me, preparing some childish stunt by
tying a ring in my handkerchief, while he
poured out his usual silly patter.
Suddenly I jumped and nearly dropped
the stick. It was Micky Maple’s voice that
was speaking softly in my ear!
“Don’t look round. Bill, old man,” the
voice was saying. “For God’s sake keep
your fat head ! Come and see me after this
turn in my dressing-room. Been, zwei, drie, i,
erli, san. Oli my! Juggler !” Micky's whis-
pered tones had lapsed into the conjurer’s
professional jargon.
I took a sideways look at the juggler s
face. It was the same tormented mask, but
there seemed to be a queer, humorous light
in the black eyes which, I fancied, if they
had only been blue, might easily have been
Micky’s. I don’t know how the trick went,
but I got back to my seat at last with my
head spinning.
I didn’t feel in any mood to listen to the
chaff of my pals, and still less did I want
to see the great event of the evening which
had been starred on all the hoardings. When
I saw them bringing on a stone —the same
stone, I could have sworn, that figured on
the night of Micky Maple’s death—l felt
sicker than ever and went outside to cool
down and smoke a cigarette.
The cigarette steadied my nerves a bit,
and I returned in search of the juggler. I
found him in a little dingy dressing-room
somewhere at the back, having his gaudy
turban unwound by his white attendant,
who was obviously not liking this job of
waiting on a black man, and who looked
at the juggler’s visitor a little contemptu-
ously.
As soon as the attendant had gone, the
juggler dropped his broken English, and,
looking me straight in the eyes, said in the
authentic voice of Micky Maple: “Well,
my boy, what do you think of it?”
“Either,” I said, “I’ve had too much to
drink, which I doubt, or it's a nightmare, or
you’re a blessed avatar. If you’ll assure me
you’re neither a fantod nor a dream, I'll
have to admit it's a case of transmigration.’
“That’s it,” said the juggler, with the
voice of Micky Maple; “I’ve thought about
it for months, and that’s the best I can
make of it. It’s a poor best, by God,” he
sobbed suddenly, dropping his head in his
hands.
I stared mutely at the skinny, shaking
shoulders of the juggler. If it was really
Micky Maple’s soul encased in the body of
that infernally ugly Indian I saw squatting
in his tawdry finery in front of me, I ought
to have gone up and embraced it. But I
hadn’t the heart to. I searched my soul
A SLIGHT HITCH.

Finnegan?” ,

for words of comfort, but couldn't find any.
The whole thing was too confoundedly fan-
tastic to admit of any comment.
Presently Micky or the juggler, I couldn’t
yet say even to myself which, jumped up
and, forcing me into his only chair, as if
he were afraid I might try to run away,
began to shuffle to and fro between me and
the door. Then, in that familiar voice I
knew so well, he began to tell his story.
The Lord only knew exactly what had
happened on that night. That infernal
thunderclap must have gone off right inside
his head. Something snapped, and Micky
woke up in a sort of native shed, somewhere.


Rain was falling. The little juggler was.
bending over him. It took him a long tune
to realise the situation, but AA'lien he did he
Avent mad. Not that he lost his senses.
No, no such luck! But he went crazy with
disgust and horror. He had always liked
the natives in their place, but to find him-

even.”
“Did she tell you I bought her a home, and I can’t keep

self Avitli all his faculties, with all the facul-
ties of Micky Maple, in the unwashed body
of a Hindu juggler!
“Cheerful possie for a white Australian,
ain’t it?” he said sardonically, thrusting out
a brown and withered arm and looking at
it quizzically.
He wanted to go back to the quarters
and explain it all to the chaps. They were
a decent crowd and would understand, he
thought. But his companion wouldn’t let
him go, and, when he persisted, called in
the native police. The authorities decided
he Avas mad and got him down to Batavia,
where they shipped him off to India.
“Back to my native land, you knoAv,”
went on Micky, twisting his juggler’s lips
into a wry smile. “I don’t remember too
Avell what happened then. I got back to
my own village at last. Dirty little mud-
walled affair up country. I found I was a
mandarin of some consequence there. A
bit of a rajput. My father had been a reigning
prince or something of the sort and got
into hot Avater witn the English over the
Mutiny. They deposed the old boy and so
I took to juggling. When I say ‘l,’ of
course I mean this god-forsaken, wrinkled
bow-legged heathen corpse I’m trapped in,”
he broke out in a sudden spasm of fury.
After a few minutes he went on more
quietly. He had managed, by practising the
' juggler’s crart and sponging on his Indian
relatives, to get a little money together and
he had worked his way doAvn to Calcutta
at last. There, after many disappointments
and rebuffs, he had signed a contract with
a theatrical agent for an Australian tour.
They provided the up-to-date costume and the
accoutrements, and the strolling juggler was
metamorphosed into Hassan the Great. He
knew his wife must have returned to Adel-
aide and he wanted desperately to see her.
Well, he had seen her. His eyes grew
gloomy at the recollection. He had found
out where she lived and had loitered on the
other side of the road day after day hunger-
ing for a glimpse of her. And then one
morning she had come out to feed a tame
canary hanging in the porch. Her eyes had
met his, and for that moment he had for-
gotten that the enraptured soul of Micky
Maple Avas clothed in the wrinkled body of
a Hindu juggler. He had sprung toAvards
her with an exultant shout upon his lips;
and at once a look of terror had come into
her face and she had stepped back and
slammed the door.
That made him realise what he was up
against. It Avas useless, lie could see, try-
ing to introduce himself to his Avife direct;
There was nobody he could confide in, and
only a lunatic would believe his story. And
there was no time to waste, because to-
morrow the slioav moved on to Melbourne.
Then he lidd caught sight of me amongst
the audience. I Avas like a ray of sun-
shine to a prisoner in his cell. He could
have shrieked for joy.
“Bill,” he said, putting his brown-backed,
pale-palmed hands with the long sensitive
fingers and small nails of a high-caste native
on my shoulders, “you’re a decent sport.
Tell me straight. I'm not so damned, infern-
ally ugly, am I? She’s a sweet girl. She’d
understand. She loved me and, anyhow,
beauty, as the poet said, is only skin-deep.
She’d believe if you explained things
properly. You know —transubstantiation
and Karma and all that. You used to swot
it up yourself. Tell her I only want to see
her, if you like, to hear her voice!”
He stopped and stared at me with a
look of frightful eagerness on his face. I
promised I would do my best. What else
could I do? It was my pal’s voice, Micky
Maple’s voice, asking. My best pal. I
found myself out in the street running for
the last car and wondering if the whole
evening had been a nightmare.
I couldn’t sleep a wink that night, and
next morning early, after breakfast, I set
out to call on Mrs. Maple. I had rehearsed
all night what I was going to say. I had
divided my address into three sections. I
would lead off with a little dissertation on
the doctrine of reincarnation; then I would
discuss what our feelings should be if our
nearest and dearest accidentally took a new
shape. Then —well, then I Avould boldly
and briefly tell her the whole story, describe
Micky’s devotion, the beauty of his soul and
his suffering, and finally throw his present
misshapen body, so to speak, upon her mercy.
During the night it had appeared a per-
fectly reasonable exposition; but noiv, as
the tram carried me across the flat, new,
treeless suburb along one rectangular street
after another, it began to look more and
more painfully absurd. I got out at length
at the corner of Mrs. Maple’s street. It Avas
like every other street in that _ so-called
garden suburb, which looked as if it had
been designed by a toAvn clerk with a ruler
and a «pair of dividers. I walked along
between the tAVO rows of prim houses each
set in its fenced rectangle of orderly garden,
and rang the bell of one that looked exactly
like all the rest, but had a canary singing
in the porch. A trim maid showed me into
the tidy sitting-room, and
after a long wait Mrs. Maple
entered.
I understood at once why
she liked that suburb, and 1
could see, too, that she Avasn’t
pleased to see me. She
wanted to forget that dis-
orderly episode, her married
life, as quickly as possible,
and I was an unwelcome re-
minder of it. We talked
about the weather and my
trip down, and after a very
short while I found myself
outside in the street again,
kicking myself for a mangy
hound. I had played a dirty
trick on Micky—on Micky,
moping at this moment in his
black skin in the bedroom of
his second-rate hotel. I
hadn’t dared to mention the
real purpose of my visit. All
I had been able to say to
Mrs. Maple was that I had
a friend who had known her
late husband and was an-
xious to make her acquaint-
ance. I could see that she
would have liked to turn me
down, but she couldn't very
well, and so she had agreed
to be at home that afternoon.
I didn’t dare to go and tell Micky. 1
slunk about the city Avith a splitting head-
ache, Avaiting for the time when Ave had
agreed to meet.
It Avas a scorching day, and by 3 o’clock
I was parched and dizzy. When the juggler
—damn it, I mean Micky—came along I
suav at once that he had got himself up with
care.. He had a iicav blue suit on, a velour
hat, sober-colored socks and a pair of neat
brogue shoes, and in his buttonhole was
the red geranium Micky had always Avorn
on state occasions. His costume, in fact,
left nothing to be desired; but my heart
fairly bled for him. His get-up only made
more obvious the absurdity of the grinning,
SHE'D HAVE TO SWALLOW IT.

DOC: “Mm’m! I’m afraid you will have to take it internally.”
grizzly head, sticking out of the immaculate
white collar like a brown and wrinkled walnut.
He was silent on the long rattling tram-
ride to the house. I could see he couldn't
trust himself to speak. He was bursting
with suppressed excitement, and his exultant
spirit shone out of his eyes. I had con-
fessed in the tram how I had let him down,
but it didn’t damp his spirits. As he
Avalked from the tram-stop he pushed out
his hollow chest and straightened his legs
and commenced striding along as Micky did
in the old days when we used to walk through
the rain in Java. I stole a look at his
face. Clearly he had forgotten he was
Hassan the Indian juggler. He was Micky
Maple, in love with the sweetest little girl
in the world, who Avas in love with him.
The canary was still chirping over the
front door and the same prim maid showed
us into the same tidy sitting-room.
The first thing Micky saw was his own
portrait on the mantelpiece. It leant
against a mirror, and as he stared delightedly
at it he must have seen, staring behind it,
like Hyde looking over Jekyll’s shoulder,
the face of the Indian juggler. That infernal,
long-faced juggler!
All the starch went clean out of him.
When the door handle turned he began to
tremble, and I saw him glance round at the
windoAv as if he thought of running away.
When the door opened and showed Mrs.
Maple standing there, very neat and pretty
in a white muslin dress, lie didn’t look at
her for a long time. He was looking at her
hands. At last, as if weights Avere on the
lids, he slowly lifted his eyes to his wife’s
face.
I don’t know what he saw there, but
what I saw was enough for me. Mrs. Maple
looked at her husband and then at me and
then back again at him with such loathing
for him and disgust for me for playing
what she must have thought a particularly
senseless joke, that I was struck speechless.
As for Micky, I think he must have seen it
was all up.
We seemed to stand like that for several
minutes while the canary chirruped outside,
although really I don’t suppose it was
many seconds.
Just when I began to feel that I for one
couldn't listen to the song of that confounded
bird for another, instant, somebody spoke.
Good day. Missy,” said the cracked tones
ot the juggler; ‘you savvy poor Indian
juggler man?”
How we got out of that house I don't

A Sick-room Comedy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LAUGHTER rang through the street
of Happy Contentment. But it was
not good laughter. Not to Dr. Yang.
To him to-day the very title of the street
was a misnomer. Yet it had not ahvays been
so. For 50 years a street of happy con-
tentment it had been indeed. For 20 years
he had been its child; for 30 its father-
confessor and physician, ■as his father and
grandfather before him had been. More
than four score years ago, Avlien old men
now. protesting on the brink of the grave
were prattling at their mothers’ knees, his
grandfather had ministered to the bodily
needs of the street’s inhabitants, to be fol-
lowed by his son, Yang’s father, who in turn
was followed by Yang. It Avas to these
ancestors that Yang Avas indebted for the
privilege of inscribing in red letters on his
door for all the world to read the magic
words : “Doctor of the Third Generation.” To
be a doctor of the third generation was to be
truly great. Doctors there Avere. Multi-
tudes of doctors. Doctors as numerous as
the plum-blossoms in Spring. Doctors avlio
came under all the three designations of
doctors, quacks " and old Avomen. But doc-
tors of the third generation were rare indeed.
Wherever such did exist results were certain.
Inheriting his ancestors’ precious books of
prescriptions, such a one was guaranteed to
cure at sight. And such a one was Dr.
Yang, who for 30 years had ministered to
the bodily needs of the dwellers of the Street
of Happy Contentment. If during that
time he had helped none of them into the
world, it was because the doctor did not
assist at such functions in China. Cer-
tainly lie had helped many of them out.
And now the Street of Happy Content-
ment, his child, laughed at Dr. Yang. People
nudged each other as they passed; and the
urchins threw mud at the red-lettered title
on his door. And all because an upstart, a
whelp with the milk of Western college text-
books still wet upon his lips, had asserted,
blatantly and unashamed, that Dr. Yang
was a quack and an ancient fraud! Un-
blushingly, in open meeting, this upstart had
derided the prescriptions of the Doctor of
the Third Generation. Scornfully he had
abused the prescribing of a broth of wood-
lice and scorpions as a cure for gastro-
enteritis, when all the world knew such to
have been the accepted remedy down through
all the centuries. With withering contempt
he had condemned Dr. Yang's cure for
cancer—the spreading over the wound of
slices of putrid pork, when,, again, all the
world knew that the maggots in the pork
attracted the maggots in the wound, and
thus drew out the evil disease. Certainly
the patient sometimes died. Dr. Yang
admitted it. But that was due to lack of
faith on the part of the patient, not to lack
of efficacy in the cure. Not even Dr.
Yang’s most famous cure, the cutting of a
piece of flesh from a son or daughter, with
which to make a broth for an ailing parent,
did this upstart spare, declaring it inhuman
and the work of a madman.
To dwell on such scurrilous abuse did
indeed drive Dr. Yang near to madness. A
pup, with his medical eyes not yet open, to
attack and abuse him, Yang, Doctor of
the Third Generation! He who could, by
merely feeling the pulse and without ask-
ing one question of the patient, tell him in
what part of the body the pain lay, whether
the head, stomach or belly, or whether it was
the liver or spleen which was affected. And
who could, moreover, tell him when his head
would be easier, when he would recover his
stomach, and when the distemper would
leave him! Such calumny was unthinkable.
Clearly there was but one thing to do. If
he would, at one and the same time, retain
his prestige and the love and veneration of
the street, which he felt slipping from him
like an unfastened mantle, there was but one
thing to do. He must, once and for all,,
demonstrate his claim to the title Doctor of
the Third Generation, and thus silence his
scurrilous detractor.
And what better way could there be to
do it than through Sansa, wife of Wong,
the sugar-cane seller in the bazaar? Lack-
ing faith in the regular physician, Wong had
called in no less than eight pseudo-doctors
to diagnose and prescribe for his wife’s ail-
ment, each and every one of whom had failed
utterly to ascertain the cause of her indis-
position. Through Sansa, Dr. Yang would
rehabilitate himself in the esteem of the
people. Where the quacks, including the
upstart who had vilified him. had failed, he
Avould succeed. And he would do it without
even seeing the woman.
* * * *
The demonstration at Wong’s house was
a solemn affair. Through no fault of his;
own, Wong had become famous overnight.
While the whole street gathered outside his
house, a committee of six sat at his wife's
bedside, nodding like mandarins and chatter-
ing like old women. Entirely invisible
under a doable net, the patient awaited the
coming of Dr. Yang, who would diagnose
her malady by merely feeling her pulse, and
without otherwise seeing her.
Placing a pillow for the patient to rest her
wrist upon, Dr. Yang ran his four fingers
along the artery and commenced his exam-
ination. None knew better than he the
vagaries of the nine pulses, and how they
often confused even a skilled practitioner to
his own undoing. That every season of
the year had its proper pulse even the
veriest medical tyro knew. In the spring
the pulse of the stomach ; in the winter the
pulse of the heart; in the summer the pulse
of the lungs; in the autumn the pulse of
the liver. Such were known even to quacks.
And even a quack knew that a quick pulse
at the wrist meant a pain in the head ; or a
short and tremulous pulse signified heart-
burn. But the almost imperceptible differ-
ence between these various pulses—that was
what the quack and charlatan did not know.
And that was where Dr. Yang would exer-
cise his superior knowledge and confound his
traducer. Long and patiently Yang exam-
ined the patient’s wrist, pressing gently here,
hard there, sitting for minutes at a time
lost in meditation until it seemed he had
entirely forgotten the work in hand. It
was in the midst of one of these reveries
that he suddenly spoke.
“Summon Wong!”
“There are,” he continued, addressing the
committee, without taking his eyes from the
patient’s wrist, “six sorts of complaints I
do not profess to cure. I cannot heal the
distempers of the presumptuous or haughty
who will not listen to reason. Or the ills of
the covetous, who take greater care of their
riches than of their bodies. Neither can I
allay the sufferings of the poor, who want the
common necessaries of life. Or those in
whom the Yum and the Yong are irregular.
Or those who, on account of extreme weak-
ness and want of‘flesh, are unable to take
any sort of remedies. And I cannot restore
to health those who give credit to quacks
and impostors, and have no faith in regular
physicians. But in the case even of these
last. I can diagnose the malady and say
what should be done. Where is Wong?”
“Go you, Wong,” he continued, turning
to the sugar-cane seller, who stood with
bowed head in the presence of such learn-
ing—“go you and burn red papers to your
joss ; and also let off crackers. You should
be a proud and happy man. Your Avife’s
only trouble is that, after all these years,
she will, in due course, present you with a
son. And that is no trouble at all. Did
not you yourself detect this probability?”
“Being so much away from home, it is a
circumstance I had not noticed,” replied
Wong, nervously twirling his broad-brimmed
cabbage-tree hat in his hands.
“A son it will be,” said Dr. Yang. “A strong,
bawling son. Not an unmeritorious female
child. Go, cultivate your field, that you
may bring him up in the fashion befitting a
future man.”
When the hubbub in the street announced
the breaking of the news to the waiting crowd
Yang turned to the marvelling committee.
“Thus,” lie said, “do the people always
finally acclaim the truly great and denounce
the impostor. A -male child 1 said it would
be; a strong, bawling male child. And see
to it that the people do not in future so
readily give heed to quacks.”
While the committee murmured and Yang
strode majestically toward the door, there

was a flurry of tlie nets. The head of the
serpent, the serpent with the milk of Western
college text-books still wet upon its lips,
appeared from beneath the folds, and a voice
full of honey and brimstone addressed the
departing doctor:
“A male child did you say it would be,
doctor?”
But professional pride forbade Dr. Yang
to linger.

The Water-dog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I CANNOT tell on what high liinter-marsh
* Your coal-black parents through the
ages roamed,
Mingling their yelps with honks of swans
and harsh
Wild cries of geese and mallard as they
homed;
How, swift as otters, to the reeded isle
They took their way close on the evening
star,
Leaving the glooming mainland to the wile
Of prowling puma and the fierce jaguar.
I cannot tell what ages run in streams
Of red adventure, undefiled by years,
Down the long channels of your canine
dreams,
What ghosts in whimpering sleep awake
old fears,
Couched with your levelled muzzle on your
paws,
Living through transmigrations manifold,
Old loves and hates of lolling tongue and
jaws
Strong as a wolf's to harry and to hold.
I cannot tell. And yet I dream with you
Of pendent snakes on sweaty spotted boles
Sliming their prey in the miasmas new,
With scaly monsters in the waterholes
Bloating the river tide, and antlered heads
Of deer and moose, of ibex and of ox
Right to the wood-marge, where it thins
and spreads
I p to the ape tow.s in the caverened
rocks.
All ivas tempestuous life, stayed at the lift
Of tooth or adder hiss or great swung
trunk;
While here and there—dark ghosts seen
through a rift
Of pillared trees—maned men, primordial,
slunk.
And they, wise in their wiles, secured the
help
Of your brave clan by trailing on the way
A heavy slut that had withdrawn to wheln
Far from the pack’s day chase and moonlit
bay.
So came you down to us, Diogenes,
With the hold breast and forehead rich
with room
For present thought and olden memories,
A coat of the curled midnight, with the
bloom
Of oil-rubbed ebony, the feet that pad
As light as slippered dawn adown the
skies.
The high fringed tail that moves as slow
when glad
As festal plumes, and those great luminous
eyes.
Though some may rank you with the common
brutes,
It is a wrong beneath your scorn to note:
For Truth and Mercy are your attributes.
No wrong of hate e’er flushed your baying
throat.
Unvexed, unquerulous, kind as any maid
Dressed at her mirror in a morning face.
You follow your Sir Knight, and unafraid
Hold your high place in conduct and in
race.
Love moves you rightly. Love and only this
Is the high motive lending service wings ;
And you renounced for it the engendering
bliss
To follow one, as liege-men follow kings.
But who shall doubt you have your full
reward
In love returned, unmeasured, yet con-
trolled,
By him slow time has made your friend and
lord
Since man first trailed that whelping slut
of old?
MAORILAND.
DARIUS.
On the Cliffs of Okeruru.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THREE old women sat on tlie cliffs
at Okertiru. Behind them a sheep-
track wound down the hill into a
valley where the white man’s house and
woolshed peeped out from amongst the trees,
and a few ruined wliares, nearer the beach,
showed where a populous Maori village had
once stood. Before them the sea stretched its
fields of sapphire as far as the eye could

reach, and the water danced in the sunshine.
Headlands, green with native bush, or tawny
yellow where summer had burned the tus-
sock-grass, jutted out into the ocean to right
and left, and to northward there was the
glitter of eternal snow upon the mountains.
It was a scene fit for fairyland that blue
summer day; but Oliine, Rau-pau-te and
Aroha cared nothing for the loveliness around
them. They sat on the very edge of the cliff
where the land ended as suddenly as if a
giant had taken a bite out of it, and their
eyes were fixed upon a little cove below. At
the foot of the crags, 400 feet beneath, a
jagged reef ran out into the sea. Beyond
it, where cross currents met and the long
Pacific rollers swept in, day and night, there
was unending commotion. There the billows,
blue no longer, but green as emerald, lashed
themselves against the rock in sheets of foam,
and great masses of kelp were dragged this
way and that, twisting and contorting as if
they were alive. But within the reef there
was quiet, and the waves broke gently upon
a tiny beach. Trails of mesembryanthemum
hung their pink blossoms over the edge of
the cliff, and a few trees grew out of its

crevices: from time to time sea birds flew out
of their holes, uttering their wild and terrible
cries, high above the roar of the water. But
the three old women never stirred, and sat
motionless, looking, looking, looking.
Maori women lose their beauty with their
first youth, and Ohine and her companions
were like the witches of a midnight vision.
Old—nobody knew* liow old —wrinkled and
dirty, with their grizzled hair hanging loose
upon their shoulders, and their arms clasping
their knees in Maori fashion, they looked like
the evil spirits of the place. They wore
European dress and handkerchiefs over their
heads, but Aroha’s bosom was bare,
and showed terrible scars where it
had been gashed with stones in sign of mourn-
ing. She was toothless also, and sat silent
while the other two old women, rocking them-
selves to and fro, broke into piercing cries
more desolate than the wail of the seagulls
or the moan of the sea.
Long, long ago, Ohine, Rau-pau-te and
Aroha had been the prettiest women of the
village, and the happiest wives. In those
days thick and almost impassable bush
stretched from the mountain-tops to the sea,
and there were many Maoris in Okeruru.
The white man had come, but the land had
not yet passed into his possession. Sometimes
a runaway sailor took refuge in the bay,
sometimes a sailing craft put in for water or
repairs. But Okeruru was off the beaten
track, and the nearest cities were a hundred
miles up the coast, or across the high moun-
tains. Then one day John Sheepshanks took
up his abode in a neighboring inlet. The
Maoris translated his name into Hone Hipiha.
He arrived in a boat which did not belong
to him, and though
she was but a crazy
old craft, the Maoris
coveted her, for they
had nothing but their
canoes, hollowed and
burnt out of forest
trees. So every week
or so Te Whetu and
others of the tribe
went round to the in-
let to bargain with
Hone Hipiha for the
much-desired Isabella.
“Tenakoe, Hone,”
would be the saluta-
tion of Te Whetu on
these occasions. “It is
a fine day for the
pakeha to go fishing.”
“Yes,” the crafty
Hone would reply,
“yes, it’s a fine day,
and mine is a beauti-
ful boat, and I shall
come back with more
fish than you catch,
from your canoes in a
week. She’s a won-
derful boat is the
Isabella.”
“But she is very old,” the Maoris would
answer, “and there are many holes in her.
borne day, O P’akeha, you will not return
from your fishing. You had better sell the
poor old thing to us, and we will give you,
besides food and garments and the great
greenstone were, a good little canoe, to show
our friendship for the pakeha.”
Then Hone Hipiha would sit down on
f lump of rock and laugh disdainfully,
“h ood and garments and a greenstone mere
and a. wretched little canoe in exchange for
the Isabella, the like of which has never
been seen at Okeruru! Go back to your
huts, OTe Whetu! lam going out fishing.”
But, as a matter of fact, John "Sheep-
shanks only went out fishing in the Isa-
bella in the calmest weather, for every day
opened her seams still wider.
Then at last, when he thought it safe to
return to a more settled part of the island,
as the ship from which he had deserted must
have sailed away, he came to terms with
the Maoris of Okeruru for the sale of the
Isabella. They gave him all they had
promised; in addition, Te Whetu promised
to guide him through the bush to the near-
est European settlement —a three clays’
journey—while on his part the white man
promised to make his crazy old vessel as
good as ever. lie put in a few wooden pegs,
filled up the holes and cracks with putty,
and smeared her all over with green
paint he had found in her locker. Then he
took her round, one very calm morning, to
Okeruru, and started on his journey with
To Whetu.
What rejoicings there were in the village!
The Maoris had never possessed a real boat
before, and all the able-bodied men and all
the big boys crowded into her and sailed out
of the bay to fish for liapuka beyond the
Heads. Only the women, and children and
two very old men were left behind. But
Ohine, Rau-pau-te and Aroha loved their
husbands, and they climbed up the little
path and sat down upon the edge of the
cliffs that they might watch the fishing from
afar. They saw the gay Isabella sail out
of the Heads; they saw her anchored near
the bank where the great liapuka are caught;
they sat down together and talked of the
feasting there would be when the fishermen
came home. And then they heard a terrible
cry, the sound of many voices blended in
one shriek of fear and desperation, and the
Isabella had disappeared ! Was it that the
Taniwlia, the fierce spirit of the water,
dragged the boat under? Was it that the
liapuka, as they flapped in the bottom,
knocked out the putty and loosened the
seams?
Crazed with misery the three women
rushed back to the village, launched a canoe
and paddled out to the fishing bank, calling
in their agony to those who could not hear.
Nothing answered them but the sea birds;
the relentless ocean was all untroubled;
they found only a net floating upon the
water.
Thenceforward but one idea possessed the
minds of the women, and that was the de-'
sire to bury the bodies of their husbands,
should they come ashore, as all things come
at last. So from dawn till night they sat
watching the little cove below the cliffs
where cross currents meet and all the flot-
sam and jetsam comes in, and the days be-
came months, and the months became years.
Thus Te Whetu found them when lie re-
turned from his journey with the accursed
pakeha, and thus, in spite of all persuasion,
they spent their lives. The old people of
the village died; the children went away;
other white men came and cut down the trees
and drove away the delicate things of the
bush, and Okeruru passed out of the hands
of the Maori. But Ohine, Rau-pau-te and
Aroha lived on.
For many years they slept in one of the
huts, returning to their watch upon the
ciitts at dawn. Then as they grew older
and more feeble the white man to whom
Okeruru now belonged built them in pitv a
shelter upon the hill, and sent food to them
every night.
The shadows of evening filled the valleys,
the light began to fade upon the hills - but
the old women sat upon the cliffs, uncon-
scious of coming darkness and the chill or
a Maonland sunset. Suddenly a sound was
heard, and Macka.y, the Scotch shepherd
came up the track followed by his sheep-
dogs.
“Now, my beauties,” he cried in cheerful
tones, it s time ye got up and saw to your
suppers, and ye don't know what the mistress
has sent ye the nicht! And it’s my back
that s broken with carrying it! Pirns
Ohine; pijm that Master Hori dug out of
the sand for you his own self; and Jcumara,
as hot as ye can eat them ; and a little wai-
piro in a bottle to keep your hearts up.
Down, Rover! Down, Fly !’ he said to the
dogs as they smelt at the basket he unslung
from his shoulder.
With difficulty Ohine and Kau-pau-te
scrambled from their seats and hobbled down
into a little gully, where a hut had been
built amongst the manuka. _ But Arolia did
not stir. The shepherd carried the basket to
the hut and took out its contents, his dogs
sniffing at his heels.
“Now, old ladies, make yourselves com-
fortable, and have a good meal. Pipis and
kumara and waipiro! The mistress knows
what ye like. But where s the third o ye?
Aroha! Aren’t ye coming?”
No answer came from the cliffs, and the
shepherd went back again. Aroha sat there
still, watching—watching. With sudden know-
ledge Mackay touched her shoulder; she did
not move. He laid his hand upon her
wrinkled old cheek : itw as icy cold. Aroha’s
long waiting was over; her spirit had passed
to the Reinga, to meet the husband of her
youth.
Two old women sat upon the 'cliffs at
Okeruru.
“Daddy, daddy! Can’t you make them
come down to the homestead?” said the
white man’s fair-haired daughter. “If they d
only come and live in the little wliare by the
vanished, mother and I could look after
them, and make them comfy. We can’t bear
to think of them up there, all by themselves,
when the cold weather comes.”
But no persuasion could move Ohine and
Rau-pau-te.
The summer passed, and the cold weather
came. Against the sombre green of the rimu
and manuka, the falling leaves of the konini
shone vivid scarlet and crimson. Away in
the distance the glaciers and snow-peaks glit-
tered against the hard blue autumnal sky.
And many days, when the great winds blew,
and the grey-green billows rolled in from the
ocean and broke at the foot of the cliff,
with a voice like thunder, and the air was
full of salt spray, the old women could not
crawl out of the shelter in the gully, hut sat
all day huddled up in the blankets given by
the white man’s wife.
Then, when the wind fell, and the sun
came out again, they crawled up the little
path, and took their places looking out to
sea.
But one morning Ohine did not answer
when Rau-pau-te called her. Rau-pau-te did
not look at her; she left her there, and with
infinite difficulty dragged her stiff limbs along
the sheep track.
“Why, where’s Ohine?” asked the shep-
herd, as he brought the evening meal.
Rau-pau-te did not even answer him. Her
eyes—bleared, almost blind—were fixed on
the sea below where the cross currents
meet.
Mackay went to the shelter. Under the
blankets he found the worn-out shell of
Ohine. Iler waiting was over too.
One old Maori woman sat on the cliffs at
Okeruru.
The winter passed, the spring came again.
The headlands were all green with delicate
grass. The white convolvulus opened its
frail blossoms —so frail that the wind easily
tears them into ribbons—over the shelter in
the gully. The moko-mokns chased each
other in the early morning, singing their very
hearts out for joy of love and life. The
kawliai , in the warm little valley, was a mass
of living gold: and the parson birds, with
their metallic black backs, and little white
tufts of feathers under their chins, hovered
around it to filch the honey from the long,

you?”
yellow blossoms. Rau-pau-te, almost blind
and totally deaf, sat in the sunshine when
the white man and his daughter rode up and
tied their horses to a flax bush.
“It breaks my heart to see her,” said the
fair-haired girl, looking towards the hunched-
up old crone.
“She has not much longer to wait,” said
her father gravely.
Almost before he had finished speaking
Rau-pau-te, who had so long been almost
paralysed, started to her feet with the energy
of a young woman. They saw her stand
straight who had so long been bent almost
double —saw her stand on the edge of the
cliff, between the blue sky and the sapphire
ocean. They saw her for a moment in the
sunshine with her arms stretched out as if
to embrace someone who was returning from
the sea. The next moment she had gone;
and the gulls flew out, wildly screaming,
from their lairs in the rocks.
They found all that was left of her, a few
days afterwards, washed un into the little
cove where cross currents meet and all the
flotsam and jetsam comes in.
Above the cliffs of Okeruru there are
three graves.

An Adventure in Eugenics.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
U, HERE’S an article may interest
you, Berry,” and Doctor Devenish
tossed a medical journal lie had
been reading to his colleague. The latter
and younger man, occupying the same cham-
bers as Devenish, and working with him.
lay sprawled in an easy chair, pipe in mouth,
staring at the ceiling, evidently pondering
some problem. The words and the fluttered
paper at his feet broke the reverie.
“It has some personal reference to your
work of long ago. After many years and
from far parts, behold the prophet!”
“Hum!” grunted Berry as lie settled the
spectacles on his nose. “Once kicks, now
honors; wonder they didn’t wait till I was
dead. Yes. I see. Brief and to the point.
‘lt is held that leprosy is much more
common than is supposed.’ Is it now? It
is about—let me think —yes, about 30 years
since the neglected prophet cried it aloud,
and was damned for his pains.”
"Dost all interest in it, I suppose?”
“Not quite all. Once you get a bee of
‘hat kind in your bonnet, it gives a feeble
buzz now and again. But I don’t nose
after it as I did then.”
“By the way, I learn from the article
that you experts have chucked over heredity.
Pass me the journal—l’ll read it: ‘With the
doctrine of heredity looming large in the
accepted views of the aetiology, there was.a
tendency to relax measures of segregation.
That no relaxation should be tolerated is
now an accepted fact.’ Always segrega-
tion?”
"Yes. If you knew your Act you wouldn’t
ask. Got to report ‘immediately.’ So saith
the Law.”
“Going back to the theory of heredity,
Berry—is it quite exploded?”
“Oh no ! But the fact that in the islands
leprosy, when it got in, spread like wild-
fire, gave it a hard knock. Couldn’t be here-
dity there.”
“Still, there may be something in the
theory?”
“Maybe. There are many doubtful sound-
ings in the sea of pathology. Why do you
ask? Just general knowledge or some speci-
fic case?”
“Well, not quite a case. A sentence in
the article stimulated an almost-forgotten
memory. It says: ‘Many patients die of an
inter-current disease when they are actually
suffering from leprosy in an early stage.’
That reminded me. A good few years ago
now I was called in to the case of an old
major—he’d been pensioned from the Indian
Army and had taken up residence here, i
saw him several times, and eventually he
died from what was practically senile decay.
Now, I have never had any clinical experi-
ence in leprosy—only text-book diagnosis to
go on—but I had a suspicion that this old
man had traces of it.”
“It is always difficult, sometimes devilish
difficult, to diagnose these border-line cases.”
“Well, the old major had a discoloration
of small areas of the skin, also slight con-
traction of one hand, with some anaesthesia.
But I never followed it up—couldn’t. He
was old and dying.”
“Might have been a leper—not possible
to say on that evidence. Poor old chap! It
was lucky no other medical Paul Pry spotted
it, if it were leprosy.”
“Doctor Devenish wanted on the ’phone,
sir.”
The doctor followed the attendant and re-
turned some 10 minutes later with hat and
overcoat.
“Sorry, Berry! Hoped we might have
a quiet night, and early to bed; but in our
rotten profession a man’s time is not his
own. It’s not, however, a professional call.
Tolin Marks has just rung me up to give
him a look in. You’ve met him?”
“Yes, I think so. Retired merchant of
some kind. Rather doddery old bird.”
, “May be doddery. Berry, as you say; but
I’ve known John for 40 years, and when
you were probably at a preparatory school
he was head of a big soft-goods firm.' One of
the old school, straight as they made them
in those days, and _ that was nearly full-
blooded Puritan. Wife was a dear soul, died
10 _ years ago, leaving one surviving child.
Phil came late, about 15 years after I knew
the family; the two girls died—one married,
the other about to be. Consequently the
youngster is the apple of his father’s eye,
the core of his heart. Phil goes the pace
nowadays, but lie’s got some of the saving
grace of his father. Saw the war through,
got a medal—for what it was worth—and
a badly-plugged arm. Going to be married
soon. Which gingers up the old man im-
mensely—thinks it will make him young
again. Ah. well! Night!”
Berry heard the car move off, and settled
before the cosy fire with pipe and novel.
Soon the novel lay on his lap, and he stared
into the red glow of the coals. The article
in the journal had turned his thought back-
ward to the early days of zeal, the days of
ambitions long since dead, of research that
was to. land him— where? Here, a general
practitioner, a bachelor coupled to a bachelor
in a sort of sexless matrimonial union, its
nexus friendship, its product guineas.
* * * *
“Well. John, here I am. What’s the
trouble?”
. “Oh, nothing in particular—just thought
I’d like to see you about a little matter.
You’ve given up night practice, haven’t
you ?”
“Yes-—except for a few old patients, more
friends than clients. How’s the only pebble
on the beach?”
“Phil?”
“Yes, Phil, of course.”
“To tell you the truth, I see very little
of him. Not that anything stands between
us. God forbid it ever should! But you
know what it is with a man and a maid. '
“Well, you do. old chap; you married.
I never had the pluck. Still, I like romance,
second-hand, in a novel or in the lives of
the youngsters I know. I suppose Phil is
a romantic young Romeo?”
“Thinks of nothing else! Wastes his
money on a profusion of nothings to lay at
her feet.”
“But, my dear fellow, they all do. When
you were young—eh, what?”
“Yes, yes, Devenish. Youth is prodigal—
even of life.”
“Now, what is it you want to see me
about?”
"The fact is I have had a rather strange
letter from Phyllis’s mother. I've known
the family for many years, and since her
husband’s death have looked after their
affairs. I was co-trustee under his will.
But the old lady seems to have been reading
up eugenics, and suggests—she puts it very
nicely—-that I should furnish her with a
clean bill of health for Phil.”
The doctor chuckled as he filled his pipe.
“First time I've been asked for such a
thing, though it's sensible enough. In fact,
the right tiling to do—but it isn't done.”
“Per. onally, I’ve no objections to the boy
being examined, though many a man would
EASY.
“Jack says it's guite simple for a man to please a woman.”
“ What's his method?”
“He says that all he has to do is to make a fool of himself over her.”
get on his stilts about it. Will you fix it
up. Fred? Examine him thoroughly as if
lie were a stranger. If it’s all right, say so.
If it isn't, just put it, ‘Can’t advise the
marriage.’ I don’t want particulars; they
are your affair and the boy’s.”
They left it at that. Marks as if glad to
be rid of an awkward matter, and drifted
gladly into a discussion of current politics.
As Devenish was leaving he returned to
the subject. “I say, Marks! What about
the girl? What’s sauce for the gander ought
to be, sauce for the goose—l beg her pardon.”
“Oh. I forgot to say the old lady implied
that if I wished it there could be an ex-
change of certificates.”
“Ought, to be. Fair play is bonny play.”
“Well, will you be the mutual confidant?”
“As you like; it’s a novelty that breaks
the monotony of practice. Arrange an en-
gagement with her; of Course, her mother
will be present. By the way, who is the
lady?”
“She is the widow of a military officer in
the East —Bengal, I believe. They settled
here about 15 years ago.”
* * * *
Next day. punctually at the appointed
hour, and after an exceptionally fortifying
luncheon, Phil presented himself for inspec-
tion.
“Queer stunt this, doctor. The pater ex-
plained it to me.”
“Then you know all there is to tell. Now%
strip and let me run over you. Anything
you want to tell me? You know what pro-
fessional confidence is.”
“Of course. But I’ve nothing to tell,
really—beyond, measles, the ’flu and that
sort of thing. Nothing to make me think
twice about marriage.”
“Well, that’s good. By the way, do you
know anything about your family history?”
“Never heard of anything—-beyond a touch
of gout Or neuritis in the old man.”
“Oh. I know all about him.”
At last the examination w*as concluded.
“Glad to say I can give you a clean bill,
young man—unless you have kept something
back I’ve not got on to.”
“Nothing, doctor, on my honor.”
“Now. about the young lady?”
“Good God! You’re not going to examine
Phyllis?”
“My dear Phil, it isn’t the young lady or
you we are worrying about; it’s the young
Phils and Phyllises. This is your first ex-
perience of the up-to-date mother-in-law.
If Miss Clyde is sensible she’ll do as you’ve
done. If she does’ not, things may not run
unite smoothly. Refusal often spells fear.
Don’t interfere; let the lady and her mother
‘settle the matter.”
“I’ll be no party to it.”
“Of course, you won’t. You are only a
might-be or a might-not-be, a young man
who know r s nothing about eugenics.”
“Curse eugenics!”
Three days later the doctor was called to
the ’phone——“Marks. Yes, John; what
is it? Send her along the day after to-
morrow—Thursday, before 10. Phil? Yes,
quite sound. Very indignant about the girl.
Yes, yes.”
On Thursday Phillis arrived, a little late,
accompanied by Mrs. Clyde, a slight-framed
woman with pale, set, expressionless face.
The interview on this occasion was longer
than it had been in the case of Phil; indeed,
so protracted that half-past 10 came, and
passed—the waiting-room filled with fidget-
ing and indignant patients—before the
mother and daughter were ushered out,
through the private apartments. As they
left Devenish asked for a further interview
the following morning at a somewhat earlier
hour—“say. shortly after 9.”
Mrs. Clyde departed in a haze of mental
disturbance, not without some qualms about
eugenic enthusiasm, and Phyllis in restrained
rebellion against parental control.
* * * *
After a crowded day Devenish and Berry
met again in their common room.
“Berry, there’s a case I want you to see
to-morrow. I’ll contrive some excuse —be
called away, urgent call. You'll have to be
diplomatic: say—oh. damn it, say anything
you can think of. but see the girl. Eh?
Well, just say you think, from what I told
you hurriedly, that I suspect some obscure
trouble of the nerves that may need a little
attention. That will satisfy ’em. Nerves
cover the whole field of pathology to a
woman. Say I thought a little closer exam-
ination would be desirable. Then go over
her for your life, Berry. God! I’ve either
got that infernal business we were talking
about the. other night on my own nerves, or
there’s something in it, something real. For
Heaven’s sake, let us make no mistake.”
Berry stretched himself in his chair and
raised his head, the half-closed eyes behind
the spectacles glinting in the light.
“It once took me three months, or more,
Devenish, to make sure- —that is, absolutely
certain—-in a case. Do you expect me to do
this at a sitting?”
“Perhaps that’s too much to expect. But
if you suspect at all, make it a case for
treatment. Nerves. Give it a high-sounding
technical twist. Say you will call. And
in the meantime prescribe any bally old
thing.”
“Very well, I’ll do my best. But can't
you give me some details?”
Then they entered into a discus ion that
lasted till bedtime, leaving the housemaid to
clear up in the morning a litter of text-
books and medical journals strewn on table
and floor.
Early the following morning Devenish had
an urgent Spring-day call to a vigorous walk
in the Botanical Gardens. lie returned late
to his rooms, and made sure that the coast
was clear before entering on the day’s work.
Again the two did not meet till the evening.
Each forebore mentioning the topic upper-
most in his mind till the usual after-dinner
lounge. They filled their pipes deliberately,
rather obviously so, Devenish affecting a self-
control that did not escape Berry’s eyes.
“Well?” said Devenish. “Ilow did you get
on?”
Berry got up, crossed the room, and took
a slip of glass from the writing-table. “Did
you notice anything about the eyebrows?”
“Can’t say I did. They seemed normal —
hair-covered.”
“Yes, the hair was there. Didn’t see any
filtration of the skin?”
Devenish shook his head. “Can’t say I
did. It was a little patch at the back of
the neck caught my eyes, and her left hand
had no muscular strength in it—looked
wasted. Said she found it very dead on the
piano—no spring. But it was the patch
on which I concentrated. Looked as if it
might be an erythematous patch, for when
I touched it it seemed to disappear. It
gave no response to the touch —no sensation,
so she said. She looked a bit debilitated.
Mother said she’d had ’flu. That might
account for it. or some of it. To tell the
truth, I’m rather at sea. Finding ghosts,
perhaps, because I expect to find ’em.”
“Ilum-m-m,” said Berry slowly. “I saw
what you have said, and, as it happens, a
bit more. I expressed that serum from one
of the eyebrows.” He handed the slip of
glass to Devenish. “Not much of it, but
enough for a test. Come along to the
laboratory.”
At 2 o’clock in the morning they heard the
Post Office clock sound the hour.
“Are you quite convinced?” asked Berry,
wearily stretching himself.
“Yes—quite,” and they parted for such
rest ns still remained.
A few hours’ broken sleep and Devenish
rose. He tried to concentrate his thoughts
on the morning paper. After breakfast he
rang up Marks.
“Devenish speaking. Can you see me at
0? Yes. important. Not on the ’phone.
Very well.”
At 9 he was at Marks’s home, and re-
mained there till close on 10. When he was
leaving, Marks accompanied him to the door.
“How am I to tell Phil? How can I.
Fred? The boy’s wrapped up in her. From
childhood it’s been the same. Not a thought
for any other woman. I can’t do it. I
can’t.”
“You are his father, you ought to. Some-
one must. You surely see it must be done?”
“Yes, I see: but I can’t do it.”
Devenish glanced at him keenly. There
was an ashen-grey look in Marks’s face. He
was old. and with not too good a heart.
“Send him along to me to-night. I will
see him with Berry.”
Again the evening; again the common
room.
“Here ho comes!”
Phil was ushered into the room, and as
Devenish crossed to greet him, Berry half
rose from his chair.
“Don’t know if you’ve met Doctor Berry
before. No, Berry; don’t leave. I think
you’d better stay.”
“What’s all this pother about, doctor?
The dad seemed very down in the mouth, but
I couldn’t get anything out of him. More
I'ugenic stunt?”
Then Devenish, with some circumlocution,
came to the point.
“My boy, there are reasons—unfortunately
very grave reasons—why we —for Doctor
Berry concurs—think your engagement to
Clyde should be broken off.”
“Not on your life, Doctor! I don’t mean
to be rude when I say that I don’t care a
tinker’s curse for all your eugenics. Why,
Doctor, we’ve been settled on this marriage
since we were kids.”
“But this, my boy, is serious. More than
serious. Eh, Berry?”
Berry from the depths of his chair gave a
nod and a grunt of affirmation.
“Look, Phil!” Devenish rose from his
chair and stood before him. “You’ve seen
service in France? Faced things—death.
May have funked them, yet you faced them.
Why? Because of the greater fear of
cowardice and dishonor.”
“What’s all this, Doctor? Y'ou—you're
quite a tragedian.”
“God help me for a fool! But it isn’t
comedy, my dear boy ; it is indeed tragedy—
and Greek at that!”
Phil’s face changed. Devenish turned to
Berry. “Tell him. Berry. He's only a
stranger to you. To me lie's John Marks’s
son.”
Then Berry the impassive told him in pre-
cise terms all there was to tell. This done,
he rose and, mumbling some excuse, left
Devenish and the youngster alone.
Devenish felt very helpless. Phil’s iter-
ated and reiterated “Oh. my God! my God!
my God !’’ went to his heart. lie was no
comforter; this was a woman’s task. All
he could say was “Phil, be a man. Face
it, face it.” And that was but poor coinfort
to the stricken figure in the chair, whose head
was pressed in hands so strictured that the
knuckles shone.
There came a wail. “The lazarette!
Phyllis! Phyllis!” He broke into deep,
strangling sobs.
Devenish went to a cabinet and, filling a
whisky, brought it to him ; but he failed to
raise the sunken head, so, helplessly, he sat
down and fumbled for his pipe.
Suddenly the face rose, a gleam of hope on
it.
“Doctor, couldn’t you keep it quiet? I’ll
marry her —yes, to-morrow—and we’ll go
away—right away—out of Australia. No
one need know. You’ve only to do nothing,
say nothing. Couldn’t you? Couldn’t you
do it—for father's sake —if you don’t care
about 11s, couldn’t you?”
Devenish swallowed —a dry swallow—
twice, before he could hold his voice. “No,
Phil, not possible. See, it isn’t possible!
When you went over the top it wasn’t for
the love of going, God knows! Just duty,
and to keep your name, your father’s name,
clean. What we call our honor. My father
and his before him were in medicine, as I
am. They did their duty. So must I.
The law requires it, and it is a good law.
Most things I would do for your father, if
not, for you and her. But this I couldn’t.”
“How long have we got?”
Devenish gave a start. The words were
uttered so unemotionally. This sudden self-
control !
“I have to report to-night. Already I
have delayed beyond the ‘immediately’ of the
law.”
Phil rose, hesitated, then held out his
hand. “Good night. It seems the only
way for you and us.”
The Doctor pressed his hand and they
moved towards the door.
“It is the only way.”
In the room set apart for the master’s use
and termed “the study” John Marks waited
the return of his son. At length he came.
It was far into the night before they
parted. They had spoken with unlocked
hearts. As Phil left the old man lie turned
impulsively, took him in his arms and kissed
him.
* * * *
Berry broke into the professional routine
of his colleague. “Don’t admit anyone for
quarter of an hour,” he instructed the
attendant.
“Did vou report that case, Devenish?”
“I did—night before last.”
Berry handed him a copy of an evening
newspaper. “See there!”
Devenish ran his eyes over the sensational
headlines. His mind gripped only the essen-
tials of the descriptive matter that followed.
Phil and Phyllis had passed through Wind-
sor the previous afternoon, on the road to
Wiseman’s Ferry. They w r ere seen picnick-
ing at Cattai, down by the willows along
the creek. “It took place—this accident —
not far distant from the little township near
the Ferry, where you get the first glimpse of

another two.”
the river. Here the road rounds a corner
with a sheer precipice in the outer edge. I
know the spot, Berry. An old convict road.
I’ve often wondered if the poor devils ever
saw, ever realised, the beauty spread before
them. Here it is presumed”—‘‘presumed”
the Doctor repeated—“that the car skidded.
The bodies were not recovered till this morn-
ing. and then only after considerable diffi-
culty. It is thought, having regard to the
distance of the fall, that death must have
been instantaneous. Must have thought it
all out the night before, Berry. P'oor kid-
dies —they weren’t much more! Old dusty
lumber, like us, lasts out, Berry. It’s a
wild sort of world. An’ it’s damn cruel at
times. Just because that old man, her
father —for Major Clyde was the man I first
snotted—was a leper, these two children
die.”
Then after a reflective pause Devenish re-
marked : “The boy made some remark about
‘the only way.’ Of course, Berry, there was
no shadow of doubt?”
“None,” said Berry concisely. “There was
the bacillus.”

Moths.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AMBER shadows swaying
Where the bracken sighs;
Laughter-goblins playing
In your grey-green eyes;
Hat-brim drooping shady,
Made to tease a man—
Thus, O little lady,
Since the world began!
Moths of sunlight flitting
O’er your sliadoAved lips
Laugh, as we unwitting
All of sorrow’s whips;
Pine and pine together
Murmur drowsy clear:
“Crowned Avith golden Aveather,
What should lovers fear?"
Twilight’s seas are bearing
Past the sunset bars
Tides of opal flaring.
Shadow-fleets of stars.
Yet an hour they leave us
All with gold agleam
Ere the dark bereave us
Of our golden dream.
Seeking Eldorados.
Walking fairy-shod,
Yet are we but shadows,
Flitting moths of God.
Real alone your mocking
Mouth's divine caress,
With a kiss unlocking
All life’s happiness !
What is summer keeping
’Neath the tenderness
Of her eyes unweeping,
Far arid fathomless?
Joy or grief? What matters?
Ilaply Ave shall learn
When Love’s crystal shatters
And our moth-wings burn !
Who are we to hearken
At the doors of Death—
Lives that dawn and darken
All within a breath?
Since of all we ponder
Love alone is clear.
Wherefore seek beyond her?
Paradise is here!
Happy little lady
Smiling impishly
’Neath your hat-brim shady,
Tantalising me!
Ah ! whate'er comes after—
Re it. rose or rue—
Thank the gods of laughter
For the gift of you.

The Ignorance of Holmes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE schooner was sliding down a fair
wind in the Louisiades, and as we sat
idling on deck. Captain Heyson and
I, his passenger, some curious marks on the
mainmast caught my eye.
“Bullet-marks,” said Heyson in reply to my
query. “Also reminders of an occasion
when a new-chum, because he was a new-
chum and knew nothing of the simple task
he was set to do, got both himself and me
out of an exceedingly tight corner.
“It was in the Solomons,” he Avent on,
“I was running stores, trade-goods and copra
between various parts and the steamer ports
—and not doing too well, either, the cocoa-
nut crop having been poor that year—when
one day at Makambo a young man who had
just arrived by the Sydney boat introduced
himself to me as Pliayre Holmes, son of
Phayre Holmes, of Pliayre Hall, Surrey,
said he was on a tour of the world, includ-
ing the Islands, and would like to accom-
pany me on my next trip. ‘Have a drift

fire): “Cow of a thing if Riley's pub's burned down!”
round the jolly old place —what!' was his
way of putting it. ‘Rough it a bit, see the
bally old cannibals, and all that sort of
tiling, y'knoAv. Something to tell the pater
about when I get home.’
"He was one of those thin-shanked, buck-
toothed. unintelligent Johnny Englishmen
which till then I had thought to belong ex-
clusively to the stage and magazine stories.
I wasn't keen on taking him, for in some of
the parts I went to the niggers weren’t any
too tame, and there Avas always a chance of
trouble. Besides, my crew Avere a tough
lot from Malaita —-the worst island in the
group—and I hardly ever made a trip when
they didn’t kick up some disturbance or
other. If I could have helped it l wouldn’t
have employed one of them; but crcAv-s were
scarce and I had to take what 1 could get.
I reckoned my schooner no place for a
vacuous new-chum; if a disturbance hap-
pened, he’d only be in the way and I’d have
the job of looking after him when perhaps
it would be all I could do to look after my-
self. But when he produced a draft on
Traders, Limited, for a thousand, and told
me to name my price—well. I remembered
that business was slack, and determined to
risk it. If all went well, it would be easy
money. So. when I'd loaded my cargo,

“He told me no words of his would ever tell me exactly how much
he loved me.”
“Sounds, dear, as if he had been sued for ‘breach' at some time or
other — doesn't it?”

lie came aboard and away we went.
“For ten days I lay to the north and
east, calling at various islands for copra
and staying at each a little longer than I
Avas accustomed to, in order to give my pas-
senger opportunity of seeing something of
native life. Then 1 rounded the northern
end of Malaita and started doAvn along the
eastern shore.
“Now, all this time my crew had been as
quiet and peaceful as nannies, and I began
to think I’d got them broken in a bit. But,
I hadn’t. Not by fathoms I hadn’t! They

“In due course the opportunity arrived. It
Avas at night. I had turned in about 9
o’clock, for the sea Avas mooth and the wind
light, and there were no reefs or sandbanks
in the lie of our course. About midnight
I aAvoke to a feeling that all was not Avell,
and, glancing at the tell-tale compass above
my bunk, I saw that the vessel was con-
siderably off her course. Thinking the
steersman had gone to sleep, as native steers-
men Avere in the habit of doing, I rose, and
quietly, so as not to waken Holmes, who was
in the other bunk, Avent up the cabin ladder
far enough for me to put my head out of the
half-round opening.
“My first glance showed me that the steers-
man was av ell
awake; my second
that he was head-
ing the schooner

shore and the scat-
tered lights of a
village.
“My first thought
was to get the rifle

just as I made to

sight on the cabin-
top thumped down

crashed down the

‘They went in the

staggeringly, for the crack on the head and

and had a look round. The hatch-covers
lay in disorder, the boats were all gone, and
there was a smell of rum where one of the
bottles had been broken in the hurried hand-
ling of a case. The wind had died to the
faintest breath; the sails hung flat as
boards. The village lay a little to the north
now. showing how far Ave'd drifted in the
hour since I had got that crack on the head.
“Then I looked in the direction in which
we were drifting; and the next moment I
was yelling to Holmes to come up and let go

had seen the top of a reef, dry to the ebbed

pretty well, and I
s o o n recognised
that this one tvas
the home of my
crew-boys. It was
plain that they
were sharing the
grog with their fel-
lotv - villagers;
through the dark-
ness cain e the
sound of drums
beating and of men
yelling. The lights
had increased in
number and size.
The whole village
was on a drunken
orgy.
"There was only
one thing to do—
wait till daylight
and get away with
the first; of the
wind. It wouldn’t
be any easy task
sailing the schooner
with only the two
of us, and one a
raAv new-chum at
that; but I reck-
oned we'd manage
it somehow. In
the meantime I’d lie down and rest a bit
and get some of my strength back. Tolling
Holmes to keep careful watch, 1 crept below
and lay down.
“An hour later he called me. and I stag-
gered up on deck—l was still weak as a
child —to find a steady breeze coming directly
off the land, and to hear Holmes saying:
‘They seem to be having a Christmas—
what!’
“The yelling had become louder and
fiercer, and the drum-notes had changed to
a quick tattoo —a tattoo which I had heard
more than once preceding a raid. And the
noise sounded nearer. I listened intently
for a while, and then discovered the reason
of its nearness.
“ ‘And they intend making us part of the
dinner,’ I said to Holmes. ‘The war-canoes
are out, and they’re coming to attack the
schooner. We’ve no chance of holding out
against a mob like that. Get for’rd and up
with the anchor. I’ll manage to steer her
out. Thank God, we’ve a fair wind!
Hurry!’
“He went at once, and in three minutes
was baek.
“‘I can’t do it, old chappie. The bally—
what do you call the thing?—l can’t turn it.
It’s too heavy.’
“Of course it was! I might have remem-
bered that. Two men would have been hard
put to it to turn that anchor-windlass; it
usually took four. One man hadn’t a hope.
“The canoes were appreciably closer now.
I could hear the grunts of the paddlers as
they bent in unison to their blades. From
the din I calculated there were a dozen
canoes, each Avith at least a score of men
aboard. Some Avere shrieking in long-
sustained notes, like the wail of a lost soul;
some were making a deep-throated bellowing
like bulls. The drink in them made them
disdain the stealth and strategy they com-
monly used when making a raid. They were
mad with liquor.
“I cursed that windlass and the weakness
which prevented me even attempting to give
Holmes a hand to turn it. If we could get
the anchor up, the wind would soon take us
out of reach of the advancing canoes. But
we couldn’t get it up; and as for unshack-
ling the chain and letting it slip—well, it
takes an old-fashioned sailor to find a shackle
in the welter of chain in a chain-locker, take
out the rusted pin, and get the chain up
through the small deck-hole and over the
side, and do it quickly and in the dark. The
canoes would be on us long before Holmes
could accomplish this—if he did accomplish
it at all —and as I’d be the only one on
deck. I’d be fighting those drunken savages
alone.
“Our only hope was to make a fight of it.
So I had Holmes bring up the ship’s rifles
and ammunition, and then we got behind the
(top of the cabin, which made a fairly good
shelter, and waited.
“And a horrible waiting it was. The
niggers were not sure of our position, and
presently the canoes spread anart to make
sure they wouldn’t miss us. Above the up-
roar I heard the A-oices of men in one canoe
calling guidance to men in another canoe.
The chances were they would approach from
more than one side, in Avhich case the cabin-
top Avould lose its value as a shelter.
“I don't think I would have minded that
so much had 1 been able to see them, been
able to watch their movements, even though
I couldn’t have prepared against them. To
have only orre of the senses employed—aad
that one most strenuously—is to put a great
strain upon the mind. This close, intense
exercise of my hearing began to get on my
nerves. All kinds of irrelevant sounds forced
themselves on my consciousness—the soft
purring of the wind in the shrouds; the sails'
occasional flapping; the slight rattling of a
block. From the reef on which we had
almost drifted came a gentle lapping and bub-
bling which told that the tide was now
rapidly rising. This sound of the tide was
the most insistent of the smaller sounds. It
was such a common, everyday, casual thing
—just the sound of a tide making its regu-
lar twice-daily rise. It seemed strange to
me that such a natural, peaceful movement
should be in progress when savage murder
was afoot. The contrast hammered at my
brain. I could have screamed.
“As for Holmes, he just knelt there, rifle
in hand, a shadowy, uncertain object that
never moved or spoke. I reckoned he was
suffering, too, poor devil.
“I have no idea how long we were there
before the caubes found us. In periods of great
mental stress —and physical stress, too —
one has no conception of the passing of time.
I would not be surprised if it was only a
few minutes. I would not be surprised if it
was several hours. All I know is that when
the attack began I was glad of it. Any
action—even the action of fighting for my
life—was better than that terrible inactivity.
“.\ concerted shout of triumph announced
that we were discovered. Then a rifle
blazed—a heavy, old-fashioned Snider that
boomed like a muzzle-loader shotgun. Then
another and another. Then a dozen at once.
The shots went wide; the niggers were too
drunk for accurate shooting at the distance.
We fired at the flashes. It was all there was
to fire at, for while the schooner's size made
her visible to the niggers, the canoes were too
low in the water for us to see them.
“But the distance between us was rapidly
decreasing, and the bullets began to whiz
closer. One hit the schooner's side a loud
smack; another plunked against a shroud
and dropped to the deck at my feet. Also, it
was apparent from the positions of the
flashes that the canoes were converging on us
in a half-circle from the landward side. Very
soon they would make a rush and—then
there would be a sudden and violent end for
two whites who were held by an anchor they
couldn’t raise.
“Suddenly it seemed that the canoes were
making a change of front. The half-circle of
flashes began to swing towards the stern, as
though the rush was to come from the sea-
ward side, instead of the landward side. At
first I thought it a case of dividing forces,
so that some would attack from one side and
some from the other. But soon 1 saw that the
whole lot were going round. The movement
puzzled me. I couldn’t see what advan-
tage they expected to gain by the change.
One side was as good as the other for their
purpose.
“Then I heard Holmes’s voice saying, ex-
citedly. almost hysterically: ‘1 say, 1 don't
know if I’m going—going dippy, y’ know.
But just look at the land —it’s goin’ round !’
“I glanced at the shore at once. Hitherto
it had been on the starboard side. Now it
was on the port side, and working astern
with the canoes. There was only one explan-
ation. We were under way! It was the
schooner that was moving!
"It looked like a miracle: but I had no
time to go into the cause of a miracle just

then. With a sudden strength that had
come to me I jumped to the sheets and cast
them off their pins, allowing the sails to
swing outboard full of wind. Then I ran
to the wheel and spun it hard over; and at
once we were fairwinding on the flood tide
for the deep water and safety. A yell of
disappointment came from the niggers, and
three of their bullets plunked into the main-
mast, making the marks you see there. Then
their yelling became fainter and fainter, till
at last we heard it not at all. Soon after
daylight I picked up with another schooner,
from whose master I borrowed enough crew
to help me get my craft back to Makambo.'
Heyson stopped and gave a direction to
his Louisiade steersman.
“And th<i cause of the miracle?” I asked.
“The fact,” he replied, “that Holmes knew
nothing of seafaring. Every seaman in
anchoring is careful to pay out plenty of
slack chain, so that the pull on the anchor’s
flukes will be as nearly horizontal as pos-
sible, thus allowing them to dig in firmly.
A short chain doesn’t allow an anchor to get
a proper grip. Holmes, in his ignorance,
had let the anchor go without paying out any
slack chain at all. with the result that while
the slight grip of the flukes on the bottom
was enough to hold us from drifting on to
the reef, the schooner's lift to the rising of the
ten-foot tide was sufficient to completely free
them.”

“Carrying On.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was at a dance that Jim Treful tirst
met Mary Clancy. She was the hand-
somest woman in the room, and wore
sapphire georgette. Jim was twenty-seven
and duly appreciative of both facts.
But it was not then that his heart started
to thump and he knew all at once she
was the only woman in the world
for him. That happened months later.
Jim had come over casually with a
H’M!
WIFE; “Well, Paul, do you like married life better than
your club?”
HER AFFINITY : “H’m. —oh yes, I think so.”
WIFE: “Paul, were you very, very fond of your club?”
FIN. : “H’m — no, not very.”
letter he wanted posted. Mary was in the
dairy in a natty blue overall that matched
her eyes, and a background of shining utensils
and golden pats of butter. Jim stood at the
door with his hat off in the rain, saying that
it was a fine day, till Mary, asked him to
come in out of the beautiful weather. Then
he sat on the edge of the separator-bench,
wondering what on earth a man couldn’t do
with a wife like; that. Some psychic chord
in her responded, so that when they put
“Rock of Ages” on the gramophone of a Sun-
day something made her think of Jim Tre-
ful's dark, kindly eyes. He seemed so stead-
fast, so dependable, somehow.
Jim was working at a neighboring far-
mer’s then. He might have earned more on
stations, but he was at McPherson's because
McPherson was a good farmer —he didn’t
say, mind, a good boss.
It was at another dance that they became
engaged—there was nothing sudden about
Jim. And then it all seemed so natural
and predestined ; neither knew quite how it
happened.
On the long ride home that night they
talked soberly of the future. Jim didn’t
see how they could get married for a good
while. He had a few hundreds saved up,
but he wanted to get started on a little farm
of his own first. He’d thought it all out.
He reckoned that by working scientifically
and well he could make more money that
way and be his own boss and have as good
a life as in any line lie knew of. “Most of
those cookies who never get any forwarder,
though they do make slaves of their wives
and kids, are mugs at the game. Any busi-
ness that was run like that would be a
failure —unless gheer luck stood to them,”
Jim said.
It wasn't only the earning side of it, either.
Jim had made decent pay droving and shear-
ing and suchlike—and at these jobs a fellow
could save a good bit if he was built
that way. But you had to follow your work
about as if you were a dog tied to it,
or lose time getting another job. Drifting
about and belonging nowhere. Or if you took
a steady job on a station you just stuck
there—no prospects. What he liked best
about the idea of a farm was that a fellow—
if he was the right sort and had the right
sort of girl to back him up—could build up
a real dandy home. Shifting round in rented
humpies would, he thought, spoil the flavor
of married life. Most chaps, he knew, didn’t
feel like that about it. They said they’d go
mouldy staying years in one place. Jim
reckoned he must take after the ancestors his
mother used to tell him of. I'laces in Wales
were handed down from generation to gen-
eration ; and the family would be known as
the Joneses of. such an’ such a holding. It
made yon feel you had a place in the com-
munity. He wondered if Mary would think
it all ratty.
“There’s a place up the river my father
selected in the early days,” he went on. "My
mother died there. Dad went broke and left
it in a couple of years. But, Lord, his
methods! And the folk there now manage
it almost as badly. But it could be made to
pay well. And it's a pretty place. There’s
a bit of tableland at one end overlooking a
gorge—makes one think of an old castle on
the Rhine, or somewhere in a picture. I'd
like to build a home there and have it all
fixed snug and good-looking, and you there
and all. You know, the sort of place kids
would love to look back on and make up
poetry about when they grew up—the sort
of place that would still seem like home
even if they scattered to the other end of the
world.”
And Mary found she felt just like Jim
did about it, though she had never thought
it all out like that before.
That was in September, 1914. Of course
they knew there was a war on, for they
got the papers out with their mail every
week, and it gave everyone something lively
to talk about. Two or three madcaps from
their district had enlisted, even. Still, it
was a faraway disturbance and didn’t con-
cern them. Jim, in fact, seldom read any-
thing but agricultural papers and books.
Thereafter Jim’s favorite occupation of a
Sunday afternoon was to take Mary in his
smart sulky turnout for a drive past Mclvor’s
—the farm that had once been his father’s.
It was rumored it was heavily mortgaged,
and might be sold. Every time Jim drove
past he saw fresh possibilities in the place—
how this could be managed, and that
changed, and how well some-
thing else would look. So
through the golden afternoon
they would plan; then home
through fading daylight and
early starlight, soul cheering
and understanding soul, word-
scorning, in the old mystic ways.
All too soon the horse would be
pawing at the gate of Mary’s
home, and there would be the
welcoming light, and Mary’s
mother waiting with a little
supper set out ready.
Jim’s chance came in 1916.
Mclvor’s farm was offered for
sale on tempting terms. Jim
was more than ever convinced
it was a good proposition. By
careful shepherding and lucky
deals his little balance at the
bank had increased splendidly.
FArm produce of all kinds was
at -war prices. One couldn’t go
wrong buying. It seemed Fate
was giving Jim a short cut to
prosperity.
But about this time it gradu-
ally came through to Jim that
it was just as much his war
as anyone’s. He could not feel
right about settling down to
make money from land others
were fighting for and keeping
safe for him. He told Mary
he’d have to go to the Front
and clear up this other mess first.
So Jim enlisted and someone else
bought Mclvor’s. And if ever
a man got into khaki cursing
the Kaiser Jim did.
It was early Spring when
Jim came home on final leave
before going overseas. The
wattles on Mclvor’s creek-front-
age were golden as he and
Mary rode out from the town-
ship. Jim ground his teeth to
note the owner was sowing
seed months late on land
only half prepared. Then, the pair being
human, everything was forgotten but the joy
of riding stirrup to stirrup on the old home
track again.
Father Flynn married them at the little
township chapel the next Sunday. Followed
one wonderful week at a seaside hotel. Then,
punctually on the last hour of his leave, Jim
reported for duty at Broadmeadows camp;
and Mary started the dreary train-journey
home. Jim sailed next week.
For Mary came hard, tense days of wait-
ing, but not much time for weeping. Both
her brothers had gone to the war, and she
was her father's right-hand man in carrying
on the farm. Like oases in a desert came
overseas mailday, and the solemn ritual of
banking every penny of military allotment—
till Jim came home. That was the keynote
to which her every waking hour was tuned.
Coming after a hard day on the farm to the
sanctuary of her room at night, Jim's trunks
of books and few personal belongings jostling
for space with the chests that included an
old-fashioned glory-box, it seemed he was
there more real, more understanding and de-
pendable than ever. In spirit she laid before
him the perplexities and difficulties of the
day, and answering help and guidance came
from somewhere.
Sometimes the memory-haunted tang of
hayfield or clover-stand would be borne into
the room till it seemed so near, just a few
steps, to the home of dreams she and Jim

had builded, and her heart yearned for the
sound of the laughing children who peopled it.
It was a Saturday when Father Flynn
rode out. He should have been busy that
day with church duties ; so Mary knew when
she saw him leading his horse up. And she
felt sorry for the poor Father having to go
about on such terrible errands, and told him
so.
After the priest had gone Mary went in
to her mother, and they both cried a little
over it. Then Mary went out and. started
the oil-engine ready for chaffcutting; all the
time unrealising, for youth cannot compass
death. But that night in her room the’tor-
turing blankness, the longing that was agony,
closed round her. It seemed to come in a
slow surge, like rising flood-waters drown-
ing some poor trapped wretch, suffocating
all hope and faith and love of life, leaving
her cold and numb and dead of soul.
From my vantage-point as an old friend
of the family I watched. Was Mary’s life
going to peter out in aimless disappointment’:
She wasn’t the sort of girl to marry easily
again. If only there had been a baby ! Or
if only she had been a girl who hankered
for a “career” ! With her sound sense she’d
make good. But I couldn’t place Mary with
a “career.” She was the daughter of her
people, and they’d been farmers—progressive,
but just farmers —for generations.
The next couple of years settled me in the
city, blotting out the Clancys and the other
humdrum, clean-living neighbors I had known
up-country: the up-country where somehow
the days seemed longer, and one had time to
be frankly interested in one’s neighbor; where
folk told you things about themselves be-
cause they took it for granted you would be
interested.
Then one morning Mary walked into my
office. Her mother, she told me, was dead —
never seemed to get over both sons being
killed at the Front. Her father was going to
marry again. Mary was going in for some
land (“the old place the Mclvors used to
have”) under the Repatriation Board. She
had a good bit of money saved, hers and
Jim’s, and the Repat. would treat a soldier’s
widow just as it would a returned soldier.
She* had to pass the Board’s exam, in farm-
ing, though, before they would regard her as
a suitable applicant. And for the love of
Mike would I come and help her find the
place where the Board sat —she had an offi-
cial command to present herself that morn-
ing?
Together we discovered the building. In
a bare room, on hard, backless benches, some
20 would-be Digger were waiting.
They seemed to have been waiting for ages.
When I took off my hat, revealing my white'
hair, a hard-dialed Digger hissed in a stage
whisper; “This bloke must have been waiting
longer’n us!”
The reference to departmental dilatoriness
struck a chord of fellow-feeling through the
room. A man ip the corner got up and sug-
gested that “the missus” might find it less
draughty over there. Mary and I blushingly
explained. Then was I out-Galahaded. The
whole company vied with each other in demon-
strating to Mary that the age of chivalry
was not dead. She could have had every
seat in the room if she’d wanted it. They
asked sympathetically about her late hus-
band, and were dejected to a man because
no one of them had been in his battalion.
They combined to give her a liberal educa-
tion in the science and art of farming. Each
had some tribute of knowledge to offer.
Especially the two who had been there be-
fore and had failed to pass in their exam,
and were trying again.
“The chairman’s gone on fertilisers,”
volunteered one. “What you want to do is
to get catalogues from the manure merchants
and read them up. Especially basic phos-
phate. That’s his pet.”
“But the bald chap’s a cow on dairying,”
groaned the man with a crutch. “You’d
think old Straw 7 berry was a cross between
a chemist’s shop and a maternity hospital,
the questions he runs at you.”
They even attempted to coerce the official
whose duty it w T as to appear at rare inter-
vals and usher someone into the inquisition-
chamber. “Give the girl a chance first,”
they called. The usher might have been
petrified by Red Tape for all the notice he
took.
Noon came, and I had to go back to my
own business. Mary went out to lunch with
the manure-coaching Digger.
She called at my office next day while I
was out, and left word with the boy that
she’d passed—easy. And would I mind, but
she wouldn’t have time to come out to my
home, because she wanted to get to work—-
I’d understand. I thought I did, somehow.
She wrote to me after she got home. Every-
one had been so kind to her, she said. Dad
had opened his heart and given her some of
his best stock. The neighbors had clubbed
together and given her a surprise house-
warming party. “And the presents they
brought! I never thought I’d have a real
leather dining-room suite for years!” She
knew she’d just love the work.
Reading, it seemed my lost faith in human-
ity and the great heart of the bush revived;
and I went out and bought a marble clock
and mailed it up myself.
A couple of years passed before I could
look Mary up. I wondered if I would find
her old and haggard with work and worry.
Perhaps she had married, and I’d find her
overwhelmed with babies and cows. Or
dried up, or sour and spinsterish.
I got a cab at the station. “My oath!
I know —the lady soldier-farmer,” the driver
said when I asked him if he knew Mary's
whereabouts.
We came to the farm. There was the name
“Trefulholme” lettered on a white gate and
looking proud. An avenue of young trees
lined the old track. New tree-groupings
graced the once bare slope. Well-bred cows
dotted pasture land. The old house even
held a hint of pride in its coat of paint and
the trim lines of garden and orchard.
I found Mary just finishing up in the
dairy : handsome and fresh-looking as ever;
a little stouter, a little more mature; a
deeper, more confident and understanding ring
in her voice. Otherwise she looked almost
as she did 10 years ago, when her nebulous
girlhood dreams crystallised round quiet
Jim Treful.
The same natty blue working rig and shin-
ing background even. Round the wall of
her dairy was creeping a frieze of red and
blue prize-tickets her cattle had won at
district shows. Business was good, she said.
She was getting on better, rather, than she
had expected. Jim had everything mapped
out so well ahead that it made things easy.
Mary pointed out a fine stand of lucerne.
“That flat had blackberries 12ft. high when
I came. They told me it wouldn’t pay for
clearing. It cost a lot, but I let the contract
to two Diggers who needed it. They did it
well, and I’m getting the money back now.
Jim Jcneiv I would.”
When we reached the house she said, “I’m
going to introduce you to my family now.”
I stared my surprise. She led the way into
“TOUCHING.”
“ Please, sir, spare a trifle — I’ve three hus-
bands to support.”
“What! A bigamist?”
“No, sir. One husband’s mine; the others
belong to my daughters.”
the kitchen. A handsome boy of 12 was
reading by the window’. Another a few
years older w r as setting the table. They
were Paddy and Phil, surely two of the finest
lads ever boarded out by the Neglected
Children’s Department. Neither, Mary said
proudly, had missed a day at school since
they had been with her. “They have taken
the name of Treful, too, just to carry on,
like. No one was sure what their own
family names were, anyhow. Phil’s got a
great head for mechanics. He planned all
those self-closing gates you saw as you came
up. He’s going through college, too. if I
can manage it at all. And Paddy’s learning
music, too, as an extra—rides into town
every Saturday for his lesson.”
“Mary, you are doing a wonderful thing
for those boys,” I said.
“Well, you know’,” Mary said as she showed
me into the bathroom for a wash-up before
tea, “I’m never sure how Jim wmuld have
liked girls. But he’d have loved boys—a
regular bunch of them.”

The Yellow Joss.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JUST two years ago my mate and I rode
on the abandoned Chinese camp in
the middle of a prospecting trip. We
dished along their worked-out creek, proved
that once it had been surprisingly rich, and
felt very bitter because but for the yellow
men we should have found that creek our-
selves.. A hefty buck of the Starcke River
tribe told me those few parts of the story
which I was unable to piece together for
myself.
* * * *
About SO miles north of Cooktown the
Starcke River tumbles noisily from its craggy
birthplace down to the sea. Much gold has
been won along its short length by white
men, but it is now abandoned. It heads
in precipitous ranges clothed in entangling
scrub, and many of its rock-walled gorges
and gloomy ravines have echoed to no human
tread save the pad of the hurting aborigine.
A thousand feet up among the rocks in
the main river gorge, and forty feet above a
rushing creek that disgorges into the head-
waters of the river, there was throe years
ago a little camp of Chinese gold-diggers.
The camp is well hidden deep down between
rocky spurs and huge mountain bluffs,
screened by the dark green of tangled tropi-
cal scrub on one side and thick forest timber
with a luxuriant growth of man-high blady
grass choking the very tree-butts on the other.
There are a cluster of five cosy camps alto-
gether. Four of them are oblong-shaped,
with round roofs to turn off the heavy tropi-
cal rains, cleverly built of supple sapling
framework, thatched entirely over with blady
grass, nigger fashion, having one manhole
for ingress and egress. The other is square-
shaped, a little larger than the rest. They
are barely four feet high.
Fourteen men worked the camp. In the
larger hut slept the serang, the cook and the
Joss. From their camp to the coast as the
crow flies is a short 20 miles. The party
had been landed quietly from a beche-de-mer
lugger financed by a group of Thursday
Island Chinese merchants. Six months’
supply of stores the party had carried in
their baskets over the bush foothills and then
up the jagged mountain gorge. At six-
month intervals the lugger crept to anchor
at a point on the lonely coast, landing fresh
supplies. At such times the serang handed
over to a representative of the merchant syn-
dicate its share of the gold. Then silently
the string of Chinamen, with their enor-
mously heavy loads, disappeared again into
the great bush. They should not have
been there. The laws allow no Asiatic to
mine. But the Chinaman smiles —“Eye no
see-ee, heart no grieve-ee.”
The chance of detection was very slight.
Down near the mouth of the river lived a
cattleman, interested in cattle alone, and an
old, old fossicker. The only dread of the
Chinese was the wandering prospector. As
for the blacks, they were given opium char-
coal, which made of them the serang's help-
less slaves.
The first thing the yellow men did on pick-
ing their camp was to make a Joss; for no
Chinese undertaking can be successful with-
out its Joss. With much thought and care
and many mutterings they constructed a
hideous squat image of red clay. But Chang
Ho, the serang, fashioned its face tenderly
so that it seemed to smile —such a smile as
a father might have while quietly watching
the tribulations of his children, a smile of
rare sympathy. It looked good for the future
of the yellow men.
SO HOW COULD SHU?
“I thinK you ought to he able to girt me an idea of just
what, it will cost you to dress”
“But I have no idea of just what you earn.”
That first night they sat their Joss in
state in the centre of the larger hut. They
solemnly burnt sandalwood sticks before him
that filled the closed-in place with a rich,
heavy incense. Then Chang Ho, with a whis-
pered prayer that came from the heart,
pressed heavily into the idol’s forehead a
tiny pellet of dull yellow gold. That gold
had come from the Chinese diggers’ paradise,
the Palmer River. This pellet was the eye
of the Joss, and the symbol of what he must
find for them.
Happy, happy thought of Chang Ho ! The
fourteen Chinese bowed low in the incense-
filled hut with a happy song in their hearts
that the omen was good.
It was Chang Ho who washed the first
prospect in the creek next morning. With
an exultant cry he held up out of the dish
the tropical Australian sunlight, the rich
yellow flash of the Starcke gold. Instantly
14 pairs of Chinese eyes glittered with the
miraculous realisation of wonderful dreams.
Feverish, paralysing excitement soon gave
place to systematic, intense toil.
But first the fourteen marched solemnly to
the Joss and bowed low. He promised to be
a most beneficent Joss. They kissed his clay
belly in turn, with whispered beseechings.
STATE EXP.
“Darling, you are the first girl I ever wanted to kiss.”
“Go away, sir—I hate amateurs.”
for all to see a little eolor of gold the size of
a pea, a shining yellow pea that flashed in
Yuan Cheng, the cook, bathed the idol's face
with his tears as he breathed to it of a flower-
girl on the far-off Yang-tse-Iviang and the
grandee’s robe for himself. Chang Ho, with
adoration shining from his strong flat
face, offered his whispered promise of the
ten best years of his manhood and strength
if the Joss would but make the gold payable
throughout the length of the creek. Then
he firmly inserted the bright piece of gold
in the clay forehead below the duller yellow
of the Palmer metal. A gift to the' Joss,
forerunner of much more to come! The
Chinese bent very low. Yet again hadj
Chang Ho shown grace to a good Joss and
propitiated him to win favor for all.
With the tireless energy of their kind the
Chinese worked the creek. Out in the icy-
cold water while it was yet too dark for tlie
awakening of the early morning birds, one
gang of them would heave aside the larger
stones. The gang following would throw
out the smaller stones. The gang yet behind
would sluice the creek gravel into the water-
race where the yellow metal was concen-
trated. They worked, with only one pause
for a quick meal, right throughout the day,
systematically, methodically, each man min-
gling his toil with the others’, so that the
work went with the precision of a machine.
When it was too dark to see even the waters
of the creek, they had accomplished each day
an amount of work that would have stag-
gered a similar number of wdiite men. The
cook toiled with the others, grudging the
time in which to prepare their meals.
Each night, after the hungry evening meal,
the party would light the floating shark-oil
lamp in the serang’s hut,
burn new. sweet sandal-
wood sticks before their
Joss, and pay him homage.
First Chang Ho. the
serahg, would divide the
day’s clean-up of gold. To
begin with, all that por-
tion which went to the
Chinese merchants who
had equipped the expedi-
tion. Then his own por-
tion. Then the thirteen
other portions. Each por-
tion exact to the weight of
a breath on the littlt
Chinese scales before the
fixed, unwavering eyes of
every man present.
Then, in the deep silence
of the hut, Chang Ho would
take the largest piece from
the merchants’ portion and
embed it in the clay of the
Joss. From his own por-
tion he would take like-
wise the largest piece, and
with muttered prayer press
it into the Joss with his
strong, squat thumb. And
each other man of the thir-
teen would do likewise,
each man from his own
portion. Then they would
all retire quickly for the
few remaining hours of
night, to gather strength
from sleep to force yet
more gold from the white
man’s land on the morrow.
The gold held out
strongly, in size mostly
from a quarter- to half-’weight pieces. At the
end of three months each man knew that, did
but the .Toss hold true, each one of them
at the end of two years, if the dreaded white
man did not find them, would go home to
China to live a grandee for the rest of his
life.
Too short were the long, long days of toil.
Too long were the short nights when they
must sleep. And Chang Ho had yet another
happy thought. By day he took the Joss
and sat him on a boulder that overlooked
the creek. And each man by the upraising
of an eye could see him smiling down upon
them, glittering with his fast-growing coat
of the bright Starcke gold. And they would
bend their backs still more till wonder was
that human frames could stand it. And
the listless blacks, eyes bloodshot, sitting in
the long grass of the creek bank, drug-
hungry, would dumbly wonder at these yellow
men, who were madder in their thiist for the
useless yellow stone than even the mad white
men.
The Joss now was a hideously-shaped
thing of flashing beauty in the sunlight.
Hard pressed were the Chinese to find a spot
of clay into which to press their gifts at
night. Chang Ho still strove to keep the
warm smile on the face, but the constant
insertion of gold pellets had turned the mouth
corners down until it looked on the swelter-
ing workers with a cynical grin.
But a change came over the camp. No
longer did they retire straightaway at night ;
instead, the gambling cards and the dice
came out in the serang’s hut immediately the
Joss had been propitiated. The concen-
trated strength of the working day gave
place at night to the intense brain-thrill of
the gambler, as they crouched low in the
smoking hut and gazed at the rolling dice
as it stole the precious little yellow 7 heaps from
some men and stacked them on the fast-
growing heaps before others. Often now 7 the
sun would beat warm on the serang’s hut
and find them at play, tragic play. The
work, too, w 7 as different. There w 7 as no
diminution of it while they were at it, hut
as they swung their heavy picks the hearts
of eight men had ceased to sing. Their
months of toil, with their resultant heaps of
yellow 7 gold, had gone to others. Little
devils dw 7 elt within them. And still each
night they played aw r ay what they had
sweated for by day, in a frantic attempt to
regain what was forever lost. And the
ever-yellowing Joss leered over all.
When they met the lugger at the end of
the first six months tw 7 o of their num-
ber went on board. They could live
in China as grandees now 7 . They would
not take the chance of the dice any
longer, nor the chance of the unstable
gold “cutting out,” nor the chance of white
men finding their creek. The remainder
went loping back up the big mountain with
their heavy loads and their heavier hearts.
So another six months went by. Days of
wonderful toil, nights of feverish gamble.
And the grin on the yellow Joss grew 7 until
it became distorted like the hearts of the
yellow demons working and playing beneath
its sneering stare.
Yet again two men left on the lugger that
sailed for Thursday Island. This trip she
brought new men to replace those w 7 ho had
left, for the merchant-syndicate wanted the
work carried on while the sun shone.
Feng Shu, crouched motionless in the
serang’s hut, could sw T ear that the Joss
laughed at him—laughed, this grinning thing
that his own hands had helped to fashion !
As though all the demons of the nethermost
hell w 7 ere not already clawing at his torn
heart! For the first time a feeling of ani-
mosity came to Feng Shu over this Wonder-
ful Joss. He glared back, a surge of hatred
slowly gathering within him, and the yellow
thing gave him stare for stare, deliberately.
It seemed to possess life itself, this thing of
gold. Gold! Feng Shu caught his breath
guiltily, stealthily glancing round the smoke-
filled hut.
But his companions w 7 ere crouched around
the playing mat, tensely gazing on the rolling
dice. Feng Shu slowly turned his bloodshot
eyes to the Joss. It blinked back know-
ingly, daringly, scoffingly.
* * * *
A dawrn came when the serang opened his
heavy eyes and looked wearilv to the .Toss.
Gone! It was gone! The Wonderful Joss
was gone!
Chang Ho sprang from his bunk with n
yell that brought the fear of sudden death
to every man in camp. They rushed from
their bunks to find the serang mad. The
Wonderful Joss was gone!
The serang ran for the creek. The Joss
was not on the boulder where he sat by day.
The serang jumped into the creek, and fever-
ishly dug a prospect where work had been
eft off the night before. There was not
a color of gold in the dish ! He tried another
prospect, and another. The gold was gone.
It had “cut out” !
With tragedy in his eyes the serang gazed
up at the Chinamen watching, breathless on
the bank. It was then that Yuan Cheng the
cook discovered that Feng Shu was missing.
And his washing-dish w 7 as missing, too 1 They
rushed to his hut. He was gone.
A black man standing by pointed to hurried
tracks leading away from the camp on the
coast side.
Then the serang spoke. But it was not
Ins voice. It was the voice of a snarling
animal with something clutching its throat
“The Wonderful Joss has made the gold
cut out because Feng Shu has stolen him.
We must catch Feng Shu w’ith the Wonder-
ful Joss and bring him back.”
They started off immediately, just as they
were; and the whole tribe of aborigines,
eager at the promised rew’ard of an enormous
quantity of opium' charcoal, ran along the
plain tracks of the doomed man like children
at play.
* * * *
Feng Shu had done remarkably well, all
things considered, during the night. He had
found the sea. He was a strange man in a
strange land. He had far worse things than
death at his heels. He did not know 7 w’here
he was w’hen the welcome daylight broke.
He had a hazy notion that there was a white
man's city called Cooktown down the coast.
He knew that there was a Chinatowui there.
He felt he would be safe if once he could
mix with countrymen of his, because he had
gold-—much gold. And gold is every man’s
friend. But he would not tell them how 7
much gold he really did have. He glared
triumphantly down at the heavy, glittering
yellow .Toss in his arms.
He was not afraid now in the brave, warm
sunlight. They would never catch him. He
had got too much start: and. besides, they
did not know 7 what direction he had taken.
All he had to do was to follow the sea
until he came to Cooktown.
Feng Shu had not the slightest idea of dis-
tances in this great white man’s land. He
did not know 7 that even now the piccaninnies
of the Starcke tribe were laughing at the
plain tale his tracks told. He knew nothing
of the great w r nve of the coast line, its never-
ending maze of mangrove swamps, its tidal
rivers to cross, with their alligators and
sharks. Feng Shu- did not know of the
existence of a thing called bnshmanship. If
lie had understood the meaning of the word
not all the demons from behind the veil of
death could have forced him to steal the
Joss.
Soon the nice walking of the firm white
sand led him in among trees, low trees,
countless trees, trees seemingly thick as the
sands upon the shore itself. But now there
was no sand, and no shore, lie was walking
through mud. And he could only see the sea
in random patches, through the thick-foliaged
trees.
Presently the trees grew many roots that
bunched out strangely from high above their
butts. The trees grew so thick that their
tangled roots interlaced. Soon he was not
walking on mud. He was walking on the
tree-roots. Often they snapped under his
weight with a sharp, pistol-like report and
he went down through the roots into the
mud, jerking his head around in startled
fear. It was sticky mud, that smelt like a
charnel-house. Then he must null himself
up and climb over the roots again.
He grew very tired. He was hungry, too.
He rested, and ate the small supply of food
he had brought with him. He was thirsty,
also. But there was no water. Only salt
water. Dimly Feng Shu began to realise
that matters were not going w’ell.
He started off again, and an hour’s hard
work over the roots made him dreadfully
tired. He turned, and walked over the roots
towards the sea. Surely there must be sand
to walk upon out there!
There tvas, but it was many feet deep under
water. A gurgling little wave splashed be-

“Yes?”
“So he had a few more drinks and stopped

Feng Shu remembered the tide. He turned
abruptly, crashed through the tree-roots, and
found sucking mud clasping at his knees.
Thick, oily, blue-black mud that swelled
slowly up his limbs as it clung with a dread-
ful sucking caress.
It tvas a white-faced Chinaman w r ho
struggled desperately back through the man-
groves. How heavy the Joss was! He
looked down at it, thinking rapidly. Of
course, it w r as heavy with clay! And he had
his washing-dish with him. All he had to
do was to break up the Joss, wash the clay
out in his dish and throw’ the dish away. He
would thus be rid of the weight of the dish
and the clay and have the gold only.
As Feng Shu crushed the head of the Joss
he shuddered. Somehow’ his spine turned to
ice so that his trembling hands could hardly
wash out the derisive grin from between the
clay and the gold.
It was thus they caught him, the bright
red clay streaming into the sea water, the
dish weighed dowm into the sand with glit-
tering yellow gold. Crouched there, with
the dish held tight in his hands, Feng Shu
never moved —just stared draw r n-eyed at the
triumphant black men shouting to the labor-

But the gold came not back to the creek.

The Ships Come In.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\ \ said. “Ah, when our ships come in
\’\i Our purses will be full.
Whether they bring us gold or tin
Or merchandise or wool/’
But time goes on and all we see
Are ships of other men,
Which bring rich cargoes to the quay
And sail away again.
’Tis pleasant from the foam-girt sand
To watch the steamers rise
Out of the blue towards the land.
Like men with homing eyes.
A dim hull lifts, a funnel shows.
Yellow or black maybe—
The ship is one a comrade knows
Who knew the China Sea.
Propellers throw through silence thin
That fills the afternoon ;
An ocean tramp from Port o’ Sin
Leads in tin- Eastern Moon.
Their smoke, like incense, rises now
To praise their pagan gods :
White bursts tin 1 water at each bow,
Bright swing the engine-rods.
When smoke is sighted, far and dim.
Who knows their size and speed,?
Great liners swift the waves may swim,
Or slow boats green with weed.
Or little ones whose funnels kiss
The salt prow-lifted spray—
Some plumes of smoke we almost miss,
They pass so far away.
By many ocean ways they come,
From distant isle or bay ;
They bring the fabled wealth to some,
These ships come in to-day.
From Talagai or Borneo,
Peru or Singapore,
From Panama or Callao,
They’re steering to the shore.
Though they be owned by shipmen bold
’Tis well to think they bring
Something for us more rare than gold—
Brave dreams or songs to sing
Of breathless seas and God's wide skies
And far lands kissed by foam.
So we shall whisper, who are wise.
“Behold our ships come home!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SUTHERLAND, trader, planter, re-
cruiter and man of many parts, sat in
bis deck chair, deep in sad and silent
thought. He had taken a native, woman for
bis wife, as pioneers do in a black country
—a faithful, affectionate creature, less or
more of a cross-brood, perhaps more Polynesian
than Melanesian, which would account for
the light color of her skin, the elegance of
her figure and the grace of her movements.
She watched ovdr Sutherland with all the
silent love and jealousy of the native mind.
Her big, soft, liquid eyes reflected all his
moods: she was proud of him, and thrilled
to hear the good speak of him with respect
and the bad with fear. Mita had seen Him in
tight places when one quiver of an eyelid in
fear would have unstrung a hundred arrows
at his breast; but she never saw him falter.
And then the swing of a jibing boom had
struck her across the breast and carried, her
into a smother of sea. Vainly Sutherland had
tried to beat the schooner up to the strong
swimmer; but tack after tack had left him
no nearer, and in that sea which was a boil-
ing cauldron the small ship's boat he carried
NOW, WHAT COULD THE GIRL MEAN?
"May I ask your father for his consent?"
“Oh. hadn't yon better wait till we go home? It’s
such a pity to spoil anybody's holiday!”
could not live. He saw Mita, on the
crest of a breaking sea, wave one hand to
him, a sort of caressing wave: lie had seen
it often as she stood on their leaf-built
bungalow to welcome him home. He saw her
no more, though he tacked and tacked in
storm and sea until at nightfall his crew
was weary and afraid.
As he went about then to go. on with the
voyage he heard the weeping of a child, lie
dived down the companion way and carried
the youngster on deck, clinging to it with one
arm while he held to the rail of the plunging
schooner with the other. It might have been
four or five years old. with big eyes, dark
hair and a fair skin. He got his back to the
rail and, gathering the mite in his arms,
caressed it and crooned to it: and he swal-
lowed hard when it asked in quaint English
for its mother.
Sutherland kept the child by him for a
few years and then sent it south to school.
The child he sent away returned a woman,
tall and graceful, her face showing fairer for
THE: FATAL DRAWBACK.

the wealth of black hair that crowned her
shapely head. Her carriage was magnificent.
She threw her arms around him with an
ecstatic "< >h. daddy, daddy -my own daddy!”
Sutherland was at first like a man in a
dajfee. Then he looked at the little leaf-built
home on the hillside and thought hard. And
what he thought was: "This won’t do for
such a tine young lady, it won't do at all.
She must have something better than this—
carpets, furniture, comforts. Aye—she's
done well in music. A piano, then. Well,
well! But she's my daughter, an’ a tine
daughter, too.” And then a thought struck
him—a conversation came back to him from
out the years. “Taking native women is
right enough ; but children may come along,
and there’s no good in saying one thing and
thinking another—you're their father, and
the chances are you get fond of them even if
they are snuff- and butter-colored. Then
what are you going to do? The boys are all
right—they can fend for themselves. But
what about the girls? Too good to give to a
nigger—you couldn't bear that—and not good
enough for a decent white man.”
Sutherland raised his eyes and looked
again at his daughter. “Too good for a
nigger! God, I should think so—a nigger!”
Next steamer brought a whole new our-
lit for Sutherland —house-furni-
ture, piano and all —and Suther-
land's daughter started keeping
house for her father. She was
admirable; the cook boys were
kept up to the mark, everything
was spotless. Sutherland would
lie back in a big easy chair look-
ing proudly at his daughter as
she played some well-remembered
air. Yet at times there would
come a shade of sadness over his
kindly, rugged, sunburnt face as
lie thought that she was not
wholly white.
The months went by. and
Sutherland noticed a slackening
—the kimono w r orn a little later
in the morning; slippers dis-
carded on the way to the bath-
room ; a carelessness in the lay-
ing of the table; a dozen and
one little things. But what took
his attention and worried him
most was the change in the girl's
carriage and movements —that
something so hard to describe but
so quickly to be noticed in one
not wholly white.
“I must get her married to
some decent sort of a chap, I
simply must,” he kept on saying
to himself. “But who can I
marry her to? That’s the ques-
tion. I saw her chewing betel-
nut the other day. And lolling,
just lolling! Going to the native
ways fast, fast. Must do some-
thing.”
Day after day Sutherland
watched her. and day after day
he repeated : “Must do something,
simply must do something.”
One nightfall he came home
and held his head in his hands a
little longer than usual: his face
was a little harder, a little more
drawn.
Sutherland's daughter came and knelt be-
fore him. throwing her rounded arms wide
before embracing him. She nestled her head
beside his cheek; her wealth of hair fell
across her shoulders. “Daddy." she crooned,
“dear daddy, why do you look so tired and
worried?" And she soothed and petted him
as if he were a tired sick child.
They had not noticed a step on the veran-
dah or a pair of keen grey sad eyes watch-
ing the scene before him. From the corner
of her eye the girl caught a glimpse of some-
one. and as she jumped to her feet, her long
black tresses draping her shoulders, she
looked a goddess, so superb was she, so
beautiful.
The stranger did not move; his eyes were
riveted on the splendid creature before him.
Sutherland sprang forward and caught
him eagerly by the hand. "Doctor, I am
glad to see you!”
But for Olaverton. of the old survey
ship, there was for the moment only one
subject.
“Where did you get her? __ Sutherland,
Sutherland, you lucky old dog!"
"My daughter, Doctor; my daughter!”
said Sutherland, and there was a trace of
sadness in his voice.
The doctor was taken aback. “A thou-
sand pardons, old man; 1 had no idea.
Then he added, half to himself, "Heaven,
she is beautiful!”
"Bull your chair up.” said Sutherland
fretfully; “I'm worried.”
The doctor looked keenly from underneath
heavy eyebrows tinged with grey. In his
face you read tolerance and kindliness.
"You know the native,” said Sutherland,
bending over and speaking scarcely above a
whisper—“none better. Well, to be brief,
my daughter is slipping back, back to her
mother’s people, and I’m at my wits’ end to
know what to do.”
“Can’t you marry her to one of. the
planters?” asked the doctor. “Why, she’s
one of the finest-looking
women I ever set eyes on;
and this is a country with
no eligible women. Of
course, we know that in our
set marrying half-castes
simply isn’t done; but you
have been round the world
enough to know it is done.
Give her a dowry—you’ve
got money—and she . won’t
stay long on your hands.”
“But, Doctor” —Suther-
land spoke hopelessly—“l
love my daughter and she
loves her old daddy; and I
simply can’t give her to just
anyone —she must have a
good husband. It would be
better she went native than
that a white husband should
despise and illtreat her. No,
Doctor, I won’t offer a
penny with her. If some-
one marries her he_ will
marry her for herself, not
for the money he is likely
to get from me.”
Sutherland’s daughter
joined her father and the
doctor. The excitement of
the unexpected visit flushed her face a little,
and gave her eyes a sparkle. And soon her
talk sparkled, too. She read greedily, and
remem tiered what she read. Drifting from
subject to subject, her' sound judgments no
less than her brilliant wit delighted the
doctor. When she went to the piano and
played a haunting melody of her own com-
posing. he bowed his head and listened; it
carried him through dark immensities to a
forest with the flicker of a thousand tires
lighting up the polished muscles of dancing
warriors circling around a prisoner bound
ready for the slaughter. It was a relief
when she finished, for the thing rather un-
nerved him ; and when she rose and turned
to him. her face was the face of someone
lost, someone seeking a way out. But the
look faded gradually, and she was herself
again, vivacious, intelligent, entertaining.
As the doctor went back to his quarters
that night he found himself saying "I know
it's not done; but. then, I'm not a very
young man. and after all the years of free
and easy life in the tropics I couldn't live
in civilisation, anyway. I might do worse;
a million times worse. Glad the old chap
said he wouldn't give a dowry; after sug-
gesting it I couldn't possibly have asked
him for her otherwise. But it’s not done:
no. dammit all. it's not done.”
Sutherland’s business called him away for
a few days. As usual he left two trusted
natives who had been with him for years
and their wives to look after the house and
his daughter. To get an early start he had
everything on board the night before, and
sailed round a small promontory that lay
a couple of miles below his house and close
to the passage opening to the sea. It was
Sutherland’s usual procedure, as the passage
was too intricate to negotiate by night.
There was a dance down towards the
promontory, a big affair. Natives had come
from every direction, and the beat of drums
and the weird wailing of the reed-pipes
floated on the breeze across the silent night.
Sutherland's daughter lay on the couch
and listened. The weird music called to
her and kept calling. It dragged at her
bosom as if it was the cry of her own
child in distress. She felt she must go
that she had to get away from her Europeau-
ism and her loneliness. She arose and.
stripping herself naked, walked to a tree
that grew below the house. Swiftly peeling
its bark, slip rubbed her body with the juice;
and when she returned and looked in tin 1
mirror she was native-skinned, and shone
like polished ebony. Girding a lava-lava
around her waist, she slipped out into the
night.
There was a murmur of approval as she
joined the dancers, for the dyeing of her
skin deceived the quick-eyed natives not a
moment.
They knew her mother was of their people,
and wondered not in the least that she should
come amongst them on such an occasion.
They knew her father, being a white man.
would object; tin- staining of her fair body
they therefore understood. In dance after
dance she joined, swaying to the nati y
music, with her graceful body revelling in
the enjoyment of the wild freedom.
The morning was heavy and overcast;
a cloud hanging over the distant mountain-
top changed from black to leaden-grey and
from leaden-grey to black as it rolled in
billows towards the sea. It was a morning
to damp spirits, to leave them sodden; a
morning you would expect some calamity to
happen. Silence hmg over everything, an
eerie stillness that left you half-afraid to
speak. The Pacific lay dark in the shadow
of the great cloudbank, except that beyond
the long bar of coral reef the slowly heaving
water broke and trimmed the jagged barrier
with snowy lace. The Lagoon, along the
foreshore lay silent, without a ripple on its
bosom or a lapping wave on the hard, white
coral sand.
The harsh blast of a conch shell rent the
silence, echoing from mountain top to
mountain top, until the sound was lost in the
ranges of the distant tree-clad foothills.
Silence fell again; this time for a moment
only. From a score of villages nestling
under the foothills came the answering cad
of the conch shells and the rat-tat of drums.
I‘own the winding bush track, beneath
hanging orchids and trees festooned with
hanging vines, came the village people with
quick steps and serious faces, the women
carrying children and their burdens of pro-
visions. while men walked with spears or
bows and arrows. Stretching far along the
foreshore lay the belt of white coral sand,
broken only by the black dots wending their
way towards where the lirst fierce blast or
the conch shell had broken the stillness o!
the morning.
The meeting-place lay beneath a conical
hill tree-clad save for a belt of yams and
tara growing on its rugged sides. The wav-
ing fronds of a thousand cocoanut-trees
shaded the crowd squatted below. The medi-
cine-man sat silent and aloof. The chief
moved here and there amongst the new-
comers shaking hands in a listless manner
as he passed without stopping and without
comment.
All had gathered, from the creeping child
THE POET.
“There’s young Highbrow over there. Writes with a great
depth of feeling, don’t you think!”
“My oath! No one’s ever got to the bottom of most of it.”
to the lioary grandfather; disease-skinned
bundles of bones and flower-decked bucks;
voluptuous maidens, naked save for a girdle
of bamboo denoting their single blessedness,
withered and shrunken mothers sooth-
ing pot-bellied children at their hanging
breasts —all naked as Eve when she first met
our father Adam, naked and unashamed.
Another blast on the conch shell, followed
by the impatient beat of the drum, brought
the people together. The chief arose from
his squatting, and drew himself to his full
height; the muscles of his body stood out like
polished ebony, contrasting strangely with
the mass of frizzy, lime-bleached hair that
crowned his head.
“Listen !” lie spoke the word quietly, yet
it seemed to carry to every one of his hearers,
until even the rattle of sticks in the betel-
nut limepots was silenced. “Kanasoi is
dying; and who among you is like Kanasoi?
First in the chase for the porpoise or the
wild pig. first when we swept down on the
people of Singa hungry for the slaughter!
Wise in council, wise and brave in battle:
son of my father, child of my mother, who so
wise and good as lie?'- The chief drew him-
self higher, and as if crowning his remarks,
continued: “Even the men of the white Gov-
ernment listened when he spoke.”
A grunt of wonder at the last statement
ran through the crowd.
“And now,” continued the chief, with a
tremor of emotion, “Kanasoi is ill of a great
sickness, ill even unto death.”
The dark, leaden-grey cloud overhanging
the distant mountain-top split in ; wain as if
sliced by a sabre of fire. The noise of ox-

plosion rumbled far across the sea. The old
chief trembled visibly; the crowd detected the
tremor and note of concern in his voice as
he spoke again: “Buri-Buri, oh medicine-
man of our people, come forth! Come hither
with your wand. Let the people know who
the woman is who has cast her witchery over
Kanasoi that he is sick even unto the grave.”
The spell of the storm had fallen upon
Buri, the medicine-man of the trib.e. It
absorbed him. He was penetrated by it,
rooted in speechless attention, gazing on the
wall of black that hung so close to the people,
rending itself with chains of fire as the water
fell in a roar over the heavy foliage of the
forest. He heard not the words of the chief;
they passed him by
as if part of the
storm. But the
people, w’atching the
medicine-man, were
awestruck at the
look in his eyes as
they searched the
great beyond.
Buri bowed to the
four corners of
Heaven before strid-
ing away with hand
uplifted, chanting a
death-song as he
went. When lie re-
turned on the run it
was with a white
rod in his hand.
Reaching the centre
of the waiting people
he stood still as a
statue, holding the
bent rod in both his
hands, while all eyes
were fixed upon him.
Then his deep voice
spoke a name —the
name of a district
where resided a hos-
tile tribe.
The eyes of hun-
dreds watched the
medicine-man keenly.
Not a movement
missed them ; not the
flicker of an eyelid.
Another and an-
other district was
called, until at last
he came to a name
and shivered vio-
lently.
A hollow, echoing
noise like a shout In
some rocky cavern
greeted the demon-
stration. A sheet of
light flashed across
the face of the storm,
reflecting itself in the
oily skins of the
audience.
The rain had
ceased; a silence
hung over all. The
medicine-man called
the name of a woman
from the district
whose name had
brought upon him the
convulsion. The wand
trembled violently as he spoke the word; and
again he shook as with a great ague. A
long murmur of wonder broke from the
crowd; it sounded in the stillness as if they
were in an echoing vault.
The audacity of the medicine-man left the
natives in yabbering surprise. A white man’s
daughter to be strung by the wrists to a
tree, swinging in the wind, with a crowd of
gaping savages urging her to repent and con-
fess where she had hidden sundry food, while
they greeted every confession with a blast of
the shells and a deep grunt and the thrust of
hard feet on hard ground! They had seen
their own women swinging until they had
confessed to the placing of bewitched food in
divers places; they had seen the ransom de-
manded by the accusers and paid by the
accused. And they had seen stiff-necked women
hang in the vine ropes until the going down
of the sun and never admit their guilt. . But
the accusing of a white man’s daughter, even
though her mother was a kanaka, was a thing
never thought of before. And Sutherland’s
daughter above all people—bearding such a
lion in his den took courage! So the chat-
tering increased to a roar, while the bucks of
the village and the wise councillors made
towards the canoes hidden away from the sun
in the long, low canoe-houses.
Day was breaking, Sutherland’s daughter
had finished a dance and was going home,
when the fleet of long, low, swift canoes ran
high and dry on the beach. The dancers
shouted their fears to one another. Suther-
land’s daughter, when she saw the newcomers,
bolted for home and safety; and as she
tore through the jungle lawyer-vines and
thorns scarified her. But a relentless pur-
suer Was behind her —Buri the medicine-
man. She could not outspeed him ;he half-
dragged, half-carried her back, panting,
weeping and afraid.
They accused her of being a witch, and
straightway began to bind her wrists with
vine rope. Now she was hanging between
earth and heaven, the big tears running down
her face. She cried in her agony for mercy;
and the accusers answered back, “Confess!
Confess!”
A scream that made every native jump with
fear sounded across the bay, and carried on
and on to the mountains, losing itself in the
immensities—a wailing as if from some giant
soul in torment. In a minute the place was
deserted; not a single native, accused or ac-
cusers, was left. All were speeding for the
bush. Only Sutherland’s daughter was left
hanging to the tree. The old man-’o-war sur-
vey ship was coming to anchor, her syren
wailing as she came.
Claverton went ashore after specimens, as
usual —“bug-hunting,” he called it.
He almost ran against the hanging girl
before lie saw her. In a moment she was
lying unconscious at his feet. In ten minutes
he was assisting her home. But no word
passed his lips; he seemed to be thinking
deeply, while she cried softly all the way.
“I’m coming up to talk to you to-night,”
he said, as he abruptly took his departure.
When he returned she was sitting with
bowed head on the verandah.
“Doctor! Doctor!” she cried pitifully, “I
couldn’t help it. Always the call to go back
to my mother’s people!”
“Hush, child,” said Claverton kindly. “I
understand. I have suffered from that de-
sire all my life.”
“You, Doctor!” she cried in amazement.
“Aye, me,” he answered. "Clever as your
father is at picking a man with color in him,
he never picked me; and I'm more than a
quarter black.”
A bungalow nestled amongst the coeoanut
palms which ran in rows to the tropic fore-
shore. Dr. Claverton sat on the verandah
looking at his wife arranging hibiscus blos-
soms in her wealth of dark tresses. The
native cook-boy was laying the table.
Suddenly he stood still and listened in-
SHE’D CATALOGUED IT WRONG.
“You had no business to kiss me.”
“But it wasn’t business; it was pleasure.”
tently as he watched a patch of open sea
showing through the palms.
“Ten canoes he go, master. Buri big-
fella medicine-man go look another-fella
witch.”
Mrs. Claverton trembled visibly as she
came and nestled by her husband’s side.
“Oh, I can’t think why he picked me for
his victim.”
“It strikes me,” said Claverton. “that your
father had a hand in the job. You know, I
suppose, that Buri was your father’s right-
hand boy for years? And between them they
did cure you, didn’t they?”
JOHN SCOTT.
The Latin Quarter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HA-HA! She is back again! I have
seen her —my little friend who has
been for six months in the Latin
Quarter of Paris.
Strolling along Swanston-street, she sud-
denly remembered me, and ran between the
people, calling out my name. I was aston-
ished because I hadn’t expected her; and
delighted, for the same reason.
“Ugh!” she exclaimed. “Let us. get out.
of this! It is so ugly.” So we hailed a
taxi, and petrolled away in the direction
of the Botanical Gardens.
Ah, those Gardens! The poplars rolled
up like green smoke, curling into light and
out of shadow, high over our heads. The
swans, stiff as cardboard, moved jerkily
across the ponds, eels wiggled under wooden
bridges, and children capered about the grass
as if it were too hot to allow of them stand-
ing upon it for a moment. A man, pre-
maturely withered, rotted in the sun—com-
parable to a decayed chrysanthemum waving
against its stick the last rags of exhausted
entity.
Myself, in the vague melancholy of middle
life, with youth and beauty dropping their
handkerchiefs to me, all at once felt the
cobweb veins swell to a point which threat-
ened extinction. People who eat beef after
the age of 48 or 49 cannot be too careful.
They must avoid the company of handsome
women, or limit themselves to "Sundays on
a public parade; and then only after a diet
of thin porridge with scarcely any milk.
Dominella is lovelier than the goddess Venus'
and, unfortunately for me, I had on that
very morning indulged in two pork chops;
consequently when she clasped me through
the sleeve my heart began to beat up in mv
throat, and all the things in the garden
careered about me like the grotesque images
sometimes painted on a merry-go-round.
After I had been restored to my usual
calm I tried not to look at her, and kept ; my
eyes fixed on the advertisement kites flyino-
over the distant cricket-ground.
“Dominella,” said I, “at what hotel did
you stop during your visit to Paris?”
“I went straight to the Walking Stick. A
hotel in the very centre of the Latin Quar-
ter.”
“And what made you choose the Walk-
ing Stick?”
“Principally because it was so cheap, and
so good.”
"Weren’t you very lonely?”
“Lonely? How could I be lonely? Mexico
introduced me all round.”
“Mexico?”
“Mexico was the cook! He sat at my
table. Every evening he would join us in
the dining-room and help to eat the meals
which he had composed in the kitchen. He
threatened to shoot any who left a mor-
sel on their plates. They all said, after that,
it would be difficult to find a better cook in
Paris. He was, originally, a cow-puncher,
and he had a chest like a cask of beef. Ah.
how I loved him! Especially when he played
upon the. guitar and sang Spanish love-
songs. It w r as splendid to watch his mouth
open and shut, like a blacK-out on a cinema-
screen.When he wasn’t singing he was drink-
ing, and when he wasn’t drinking lie was
smoking; but he always had something for
that mouth to do. It might even be....yes,
perhaps, a little of kissing. Then, again, I
have known him to be very silent, generally
after he had drawn his chair next to mine
and wrapped me in the hood of his great
cloak, which had a magnificent scarlet
lining.
“But Mexico grew tired of the Walking
Stick, or lie might have felt the need of a
different diet and a different cook. At any
rate, he announced to us from the door of the
kitchen that he was going away for ever;
and 1 noticed, as soon as he had said this,
that Bou Jeram£e jumped off the piano-stool
and disappeared into the street. Bou Jera-
m4e was dentist to the King of Siam. More
than that, lie was a traitor. It was lie who
was responsible for the departure of Mexico.
Alice Giafferi told me she had heard this
atrocious creature make the proposal, lie
had said ‘The King of Siam is in search of an
artist to paint his palace? Can you paint?’
And Mexico had replied: ‘I have painted, but
never yet a palace!' ‘it is nothing,’ said Bou :
‘I go to make the recommendation.’ And so
Mexico accompanied the dentist to Siam,
and became a court painter.
“ ‘I was for many years a muleteer on the
plateau of I’uebla; following which I prac-
tised as a throat-specialist in Berlin; next
an ostrich-farmer in Damara Land ; then a
bootblack in Dean’s Yard. London ; and, last
of all, cook at the Walking Stick
Mexico said this in a single breath from his
position against the kitchen door, and we all
called out. with one voice ‘Stop with us,
Mexico. Stop a little longer!’ But he only
wrapped his scarlet-lined poncho more closely
across his celebrated chest. ‘A cook?’ he ex-
claimed. ‘ Mais non! Nevaire any more!’
Then, blowing a tremendous cloud of tobacco-
smoke, he announced his new position of
Artist-in-Cliief to the Court of Siam. ‘C'est
plus chic!’ he said, and waved his hand to
the pots on the stove at his back.
“And so, for a time, I had to console my-
self with the companionship of a romantic-
looking youth called Lucien. Lucien wore
a coat very wide at the hips, a red tie,
baggy velvet trousers like corduroy, and spats
—without any socks. He was a model of
politeness, and when he removed his cap
there was a small wire hook in the middle
of the crown, specially designed for the pur-
poses of courtesy. He knew just two words
of English—‘Beautiful lady'—and he ‘beauti-
ful-ladied’ me nearly to death. Moreover,
he was only interesting to look upon ; so that
sitting for hours in front of brown beer and
Lucien devolved it-
self into a cere-
mony not eclipsable
for stodginess in the
whole wide world.
“In order to find
some relief I be-
came a more con-
stant visitor to the
baths, and grew
accustomed, like
Alice Giafferi. to
being weighed
naked by a broad-
bellied man who
held his nose while
he read the pounds
and ounces re-
corded on the scale.
Except for stop-
ping his nostrils he
took not the slight-
est notice of any of
his customers.
Here, one after-
noon, stepping off
the foot-tray,” I met
a girl of about fif-
teen years of age,
with straight black
hair hanging over
her shoulders, and
a wire bracelet on
her left arm, hav-
ing seven little
puppies in white
metal dangling
from a chain.
When she saw me
she sneered, and
muttered something
about myself and
Lucien, so- that I
slapped her face.
She slapped back,
of course, and I fell
dowm on the tiled
floor with the
angry child on top
of me.
“Such conduct had the effect of rousing the
old man out of his habitual torpor, and he
hit about at both of us, but only with one
hand, because the other was busy with his
nose.
“Alice was nowhere to be seen, so I picked
myself up, and ran to a woman who had read
Le Figaro during the whole of the dis-
turbance.
“ ‘lt serves you right,’ she said. ‘Why did
you steal the poor child’s lover from her?
She is my daughter, and. if it hadn’t been
for your presence at the Walking Stick, she
and Lucien should now have been united in
holy matrimony. You are a woman of low
character. I do not wish to be seen in con-
versation with you.’
“Saying this, she hoisted her frightful
body into the air, and, still reading Le
Figaro, began to make her departure.
“But I stood in front of her. Let me
explain,’ I cried. ‘Lucien is nothing to me!
and then burst out with this terrible un-
truth : ‘I abominate all artists.
“At these words the old woman lowered
the newspaper to a more modest position.
Presently, after a few moments spent in
undisturbed staring, she laughed and ex-
claimed, “My God! Lucien an artist.
“‘Certainly,’ I answered. ‘ Certainly an
artist.'
“ ‘lt is wonderful,’ said she.
“ ‘Come Aimee,’ she continued, addressing
her daughter. ‘Tell the Countess exactly to
what occupation your Lucien belongs.
“ ‘Lucien,’ replied the scarecrow, “is con-
cierge of the dogs’ cemetery!'
“That evening I was distinctly cold to
Lucien ; and, on the night after that I took
no notice of his presence whatever.
“In order to pass the time which
now began to hang heavily upon my hands,
I managed to secure an introduction to a
celebrated poet who had arrived at the
Walking Stick in search of copy and adven-
ture. Ah, but he was handsome —lus large
head made to look double its size by a vast
quantity of dyed hair which fell in locks
about his collar like a number of dipped
watch-chains. Seated on a sofa, une jamle
croisec devant l'autre, he nonchalantly
applied a lip-stick to the faded color of his
mouth ; which part of liis toilet was no sooner
finished than he drew a puff from a con-
cealed vanity-bag and began gently to dabble
his face. I noticed his darling little fingers,
his nails sharpened and hennaed, his rings,
and the chain round his rice-powdered neck.
About his body appeared unmasculine con-
tours emphasised by the cut of liis clothes,
and his small shoes of treated birdskin dis-
played high heels inlaid with a pattern of
moon and stars.
“I was in the very act of making love to
him when somebody close at hand used a
coarse expression, which so startled his
daintiness that he produced a noise like
rosewater in a nargliilya, and prettily flew
from the room.
“I am conscious of some amusement at
the time; indeed, all of us laughed, but quite
goodnaturedly, as children will when a bird
has hopped out of a cage and they are glad
to think it has escaped. It must be con-
fessed we were a little too rough to be fit
company for a creature of so much deli-
cacy.
“But perhaps the least cultured member
of our party was the landlord of the Walk-
ing Stick —a person of the name of Heffer-
nan, who could speak no English: a tall,
fleshy man of the Oscar Wilde type, about
50 years old, with greasy black hair and
horrible unwashed hands. He had not much
care for the buttons of his trousers, the
legs of which gyrated in loose circles over
his bare feet hardly hidden by carpet-slippers.
And he never appeared anywhere without
two or three monkeys sitting on his shoulders,
with, sometimes, another on his head.
“He was always playing the piano, and
was jealous of anybody else touching it. To
add to his disagreeableness, he had a per-
manently sore mouth; when the red, fiery
pustule was not on the lower lip it was
on the top, and when it was not on the top
it was on the lower. Max Jambeart made
bets about it.”
At that moment Dominella’s friend, Alice
Giafferi, who happened to be walking through
the gardens, hailed us with signs of evident
excitement.
“Come quickly over here!” she exclaimed;
HIS ONE GAY WIGHT.
“How’d ’ee spend your holiday downs town? Goin’ to they old
theeayters, I s’poase?”
“No, I never spent a penny on frivolities, exceptin' a shillan ’ to
’ear the ‘Messiuh.’”
and when we; had run across to her she
pointed towards a man sweeping with a twig
broom under the shadow of a Japanese plum.
“Mexico!” screamed Dominella.
“Yes, yes,” l replied the man (and I noticed
he had a cljest like a cask of beef). .
“Cow-puiicher.” remarked Alice Giafferi,
“muleteer on the plateau of Puebla, throat-
specialist, ostrich-farmer, boot-black, cook at
the Walk ing Stick.”
“Artist- -in-chief to the Court of Siam :
queried I dominella.
“Assistant-Government Gardener in the
State of Victoria of the Commonwealth of
Australia,” echoed Mexico. “C’est phis
chic!”

The Cycling Days.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE motor-car is a highway king, while
the costly limousine
Holds haughty sway through the
crowded day where the streets
are swept and clean.
On every track o’er the land’s expanse, oil
the hills and the plains afar.
In the darkest nights we can see bright
lights flare forth from the touring car.
While the engines throb and splutter and sob
through the ranges east and west,
We may sigh at times for the cycling days
and push once more through the blind-
ing haze
Or thrill young hearts with a score of praise
for the years of wild unrest.
We may speed de luxe on a fair Spring morn
at rest on the easy springs.
As we hearken long to the skylark’s song
and the magpie’s carollings.
Oh, the wind is soft and the road is smooth,
and the seat is soft and deep!
Could a full-fledged knight taste more delight
than we as the hills we sweep?
Yet our hearts are fraught with many a
thought of the wheels that carried us
there,
Of fields where tin* golden wash w 7 as panned,
when famine and thirst breathed close
at hand,
On the woeful wastes of scrub and sand in
the land of God-knows-where.
In canvas towns on tin* wheel-worn pad,
when the West was hale and strong.
There were luring lights in the magic nights,
though the days were stern and long.
Then wheel on wheel in the sandy scrub we
rode through the sun or rain.
With steadfast will by gully and hill and
over tin* timbered plain.
We pedalled and rode and staggered and
strode through the ranges faint and far
In the old Westralian cycling years of strife
and struggle and frothless beers
Ere the children flung their first loud cheers
at a stranded motor-car.
By the sad salt lakes of an empty land, where
the drifting sand is tossed
By the north-east gales that cover the trails
on the low red hills we’ve crossed.
How long and lean were the roving days,
how vain was the scourging quest.
With its moontide gleams and its midnight
dreams of wealth and the years of rest!
We pushed our bikes where tin* fierce sun
strikes on the cliffs and the outcrops
white.
They lured us on through the crazy noon
and on till the ridges seemed to swoon,
Till the daylight died and a spectral moon
shed sorrow across the night.
We pedalled away from the cool saloon in a
street of the inland town ;
With our swags rolled slight to the forks
lashed tight we pushed till the sun
went down.
A whisper of distant golden ground had hur-
ried us forth at morn,
But the quartz displayed in the bar room’s
shade was meet for a quest forlorn.
The soaks were dry and the cloudless sky
glared scorn on our wretched plight;
Far out, where a lone land broods and
grieves, the dreams that a half-crazed
fancy weaves
Were ours till we sucked at the mnlga leaves
for the meagre dews of night.
The sun shot up from a skyline low where
the sapless scrub loomed dark;
And we pushed away through the blazing-
day, while visions of street and park.
Of fountain and river and private bar swam
up to our sightless eyes,
Till our wheels stopped dead where the sand
rose red and we sank ’neath a swarm of
flies.
But a camel-train from the saltbush plain
crept up as the sun went down,
And a dark man sprinkled the blessed drips
1 that wetted our swollen tongues and
lips—
He saved our souls with a few sweet sips
on the grim retreat to town.
Far back in the racing, pacing years on the
Norseman track we sped ;
And our hearts beat glad on the camel pad
that measured the miles ahead.
Oh, fair were the far Coolgardie roofs that
oft in the evening glowed
As they called us in with a five-mile spin up
the last red stretch of road !
On the Austin fields there were golden yields
when the teams crept two by two ;
And our cycle wheels pushed close behind
while the red dust rose till our eyes
were blind,
As the fractured earth was undermined in
the distant hills of Cue.
On wheels that carried us up to toil we’ve
ridden in single file;
We’ve ridden abreast both east and west to
the lights of the Golden Mile.
While the engines raced and the hungry
mills ground life from the sulphide
zone,
While the stampers roared and the tailings
poured on peaks of the treated stone,
In faces seamed with the gold that gleamed
on the silver telluride
We have made our well-plugged charges
sound and thunder deep in the Boulder
ground
Till the fracteur smoke hung dense around
and rolled through the workings wide.
On the level lands where the bluebush gleams
on a surface hard and clean,
How the gear-wheels spun when the morn-
ing sun peeped up in a silver sheen !
And oft at many a wayside pub we have
laid our wheels to rest
On the earthen floor by the bar-room door
when the sun dipped late in the west.
And many a night in the parlor’s light we
have met to sing and play,
And sweet were the old-time melodies that
woke at times from the fingered keys
After a ride with the helping breeze of a
hundred miles that day.
We’ve pedalled along the Boulder-road when
the fair Ivalgoorlie lights
Lit up the sky till the stars on high shone
faint in the magic nights.
We’ve stood our bikes at the crowded kerb,
piled wheel on leaning wheel,
To join the crowd in a chorus loud or shuffle
a crazy reel.
Ah, we courted strife, but we tasted life
and rich was the broken ore!
Some years were happy and some were sad,
while some were merry and wild and
mad
In golden towns on the beaten pad in the
cycling days of yore.
The touring car with its silver lamps now
speeds on the tracks we knew,
While the paths we cut by gully and rut
are faded and faint and few.
And where are the wheels we used to spin
to pleasure and sport and work?
From the rafters hung, on the scraplieap
flung, they rot where the microbes lurk.
And many a frame that bore the name of
a roadster, fit for praise,
Is cast away in the musty gloom or stowed
in a filthy lumber-room
That once was worthy of mop and broom
in the golden cycling days.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
<( T A Ilaha ilia ’llahu!” From the dis-
tant minaret came the sound of the
muezzin, and the voice of the Arabs
in their evening prayer came faintly on the
still air.
"La llalia ilia 'llahu—There is no God but
one God!”
The three men who watched the death of
day—a magnificent passing, with all the
purples and golds and reds of royal obsequies
—moved slowly to the parapet of the roof-
top on which they stood. In the glow of tin*
sunset even the drab mud building that
served as a mission-station was transformed.
“Look. Padre, more of those dam’ Touaregs.
Pretty close, too!”
The speaker pointed excitedly to where,
through the gathering dusk, the flowing white
THE NEWCHU MS —ON THE LAND.
robes of a band of Arabs could be seen as
they rode slowly along. The Padre turned,
too' and his keen twinkling eyes followed
the group till it passed from sight behind a
sand dune.
"Touaregs—yes, M’sieur Conway, and
returning from happy hunting.” The Padre
laughed, a little bitterly, as lus long brown
fingers carefully pushed the tobacco into his
battered pipe. “Morocco is a cruel country,
M’sieur. Here in this oasis of Figuig the
Moor is master, as everywhere, and an ugly
master, too. It is the old, old story of every
living thing, even the smallest, having a
parasite. The Moor of the town bleeds the
Arab of the plain. In turn the Berber hill-
men bleed the Moor of the town! All life is
cruel. M’sieurbut Morocco is crueller than
most!” . ... .
A figure that leant lazily against the far
corner of the parapet roused itself with a
yawn. <; And need wo cr expect any fur-
ther molestation from those —er—-hillmen i
“Perhaps, Professor, perhaps. As I said,
this is a land of surprises. And, remember,
of all the hillmen the Touaregs are the
worst. You witnessed their attack the other
f ] a y—they thought the station had only the
old Padre here. But for the past three days
we have been unmolested. They will pro-
bably depart as they came, unless we molest
them. Then” The Padre’s shrug was
more eloquent than words. .
Padre Michelet, one of the French White
Fathers,” lived with his mother, a silver-
haired old lady, at the mission at Tahtani.
At present the little old lady’s life was
brightened by the visit of the wife of the
French military officer, his sister, and their
little son. about five or six.
The uprising of the Touaregs had resulted
in the delay 7 of an archaeological party, con-
ducted by Professor Horatio Munro. The
Professor was undoubtedly very much better
at languages —he knew thirteen —than at
fighting. The little scrap with the hillmen
had proved that. His companion was
“Dicky” Conway, son of a classically-minded
Australian parent, who had despatched him
to Morocco as a last resource. Dicky's
’varsity career had consisted mainly of
“ploughings” and ‘‘posts.” But with a genius
entirely mechanical, what could be expected?
He knew more about cars and less about
Latin and Greek than any other man in his
year. He could play football, too —there
was no doubt on that point. His career in
quest of culture had terminated rather
abruptly 7 with his arrest with three others in
a two-up school. Now he was an "exile,” as
he humorously termed it. Parental authority
had consigned him to the care of Professor
Horatio Augustus Munro. And he served the
Professor with a devotion that was rather
pathetic—at least, the Padre thought so. The
Px-ofessor treated him kindly, with a tolerant
and patronising air. The gulf between the
English classical star and—“ Well, you know,
Conway could play football!” —must never
be forgotten.
Downstairs in the dining-room the French
officer and a travelling rug-merchant with
red face and a nasal twang played poker.
They, had played almost incessantly since the
attack by the hillmen had confined them to
the station.
The evening was a brilliant success, de-
spite the anxiety concerning the Arabs. The
Professor's conversation was stimulating. He
always showed to advantage beneath the
admiring glances of women. He was un-
doubtedly the lion of the evening. Young
Conway blunderingly told how he had won
tin* famous “try” that saved the “home”
university from defeat by the visiting team.
It was a thrilling story, but he told it badly
and blundered over the climax. The Pro-
fessor smilingly thought how much better
he could have done —at the story, of course.
The officer’s sister —she was twenty-two,
French and pretty : truly a dangerous com-
bination—whispered to the Professor. “What
a pity your poor Australian friend is not a
little clever, eh?”
The Professor lay awake quite a long
time that night considering whether, after
all, a man at forty-one isn't in the prime of
life!
The days passed uneventfully. The
Padre's constant exhortations to caution re-
sulted in a deadly dull routine. But any
reckless longings to be “up and at ’em” were
checked by the thought of that little silver-
haired lady and the laughing young women
and the boy. The Touaregs often went by,
but in Tahtani itself they touched nothing.
El Abid, a Moorish town about three miles
south, engrossed their attention. Here
there w r as vengeance and plunder to be got
at the same time. What more could any
faithful Arab desire?
As the Professor watched the passing band
from the roof one morning, his fingers tight-
ened lovingly on the gun. That first attack
still rankled; in fact, he had then been rather
conspicuously absent —sudden emergencies
were not his forte. And the fact that Con-
way had shown he could fight as well as, or
even better than, he could play football did
not lessen the unpleasant and unfamiliar
sense of failure. His fingers touched the
trigger. They were about four hundred yards
off. He wondered if he could use a gun.
The commotion among the distant group gave
him the pleasant idea that he had hit some-
thing.
He told the rest of the party that night:
“Had a shot, just to show them the station
wasn’t asleep, y’know.” In the eyes of the
officer’s sister there was admiration, and he
felt vaguely disconcerted when he inter-
cepted a glance between Madame Michelet
and the Padre. There was no admiration
there.
The womenfolk retired early and the men
sat around talking fitfully. The monotony
Was beginning to pall on them all. Even
the rug-merchant and the officer had tired
of poker.
The sudden entry of the Padre roused
them; he seemed different, somehow—more
alert, and very pale. His voice, too, as he
spoke was sharp and a little breathless.
“Messieurs! I must speak with you. It
is a vital matter. A party of Touaregs is
at the gate. They say one of tlieir tribes-
men was killed by a shot from here to-day.
You know what that means, Messieurs. An
eye for an eye, a life for a life it is then-
creed. It is death for one or us before
dawn or” the Padre raised his hands in
that old familiar gesture; it was pathetic
now in its helplessness. You know the fate
of El Abid, my friends. And we nave
women here —and a child.
There was a strange calm over the group
as he ceased. Only the rustle of the paper
on the tables broke the silence. The officer
fumbled clumsily with Ins belt. As the
merchant tugged at his collar, as though
seeking more air, lie laughed, stupidly,
harshly. Everyone started at the sound.
The Professor dropped into a chair—he
was pale and little drops of sweat ran down
his temples He moistened his lips and
looked around. When lie spoke young Con-
wav liardlv recognised his voice. - Of course,
it 'is I. * I fired that shot —I told you
of it!” , (lT
"Oh, rot!” Dick s voice broke in. I
had a pot at the beggars myself a few times.
The thing’s quite clear —to me, at any rate.
One of us has to be potted at to make up for
that darned old nigger. You’re all doing
something worth while. I’m a bit of a rot-
ter. you know. Never did much except worry
the guv’nor and get suspended—and perhaps
kick a football.”
His voice was rather husky, and he stopped.
When he spoke again there was no sign of
emotion in his words. "I’m the one for it,
gentlemen! There's no need for question
on that point.”
It was. probably the longest speech he had
ever made —it was certainly the most impres-
sive.
"It is a noble offer, boy,” said the Padre,
patting his shoulder, "but quite impossible-
impossible! We”
The rug merchant leaned forward. He
was breathing heavily, and his fat, be-ringed
hands were nervously shuffling the cards on
tin* table. “I know! Cards! Fair —no
trick —cards decide it!”
Cards then it was. A simple plan; simply
to deal one card to each, and the highest to
go out after each deal. The merchant dealt
first, and the officer called “Jack.” He
went out and the Padre clumsily dealt the
next hand. “Queen” —the merchant rose
quietly and mopped his hot forehead.
The Professor dealt carefully, deliberately.
They turned the cards. “Ten,” called the
Padre, and Dick and the Professor threw
down a five and nine respectively.
Conway- slowly shuffled the pack, then
stopped. “Say, let’s toss, Professor. Fair
—like home, too!”
“Toss?” The Padre looked from one to
the other in puzzlement. Dick explained
rapidly. “Yes —a coin—heads or tails. Will
you ?”
The Professor nodded. It seemed a small
point to him. Blood showed where his
teeth had scored tin* underlip.
Dick fumbled in his pocket and passed the
coin to the Padre. “Just throw it up. It’s
my call —I should have dealt.”
The coin spun in the air. “Tails!” called
Conway. It rolled noisily on the bare floor
till it hit the leg of the table. The mer-
chant went down on his knees.
“It’s heads ! My Gawd ! It’s heads!”
The Professor stumbled to the window.
Dicky laughed a little shakily.
“My luck, friends. Two-up threw 7 me out
of the ’Varsity ! Now”
The men crow’ded around him, shaking his
hand and mumbling incoherently. Some of
the tension had passed. Conway w 7 as the
only one who laughed.
There w T ere only a few 7 hours till dawn. No
one slept. Young Conway w 7 rote two let-
ters —one to his father and one to a girl.
There was a pink glow in the sky when he
finished. Upstairs the laughter of the
women as they dressed could be heard, and
the childish voice of the officer's son calling
to his mother.
There was a knocking at the gate just
as the women came down, fresh and cool in
their white muslins. Conway slipped out
with the Padre. “Couldn't meet them,
Padre. Don’t tell them —yet.”
At the gate were tw T o Arabs, gaunt, swarthy
men, with sensual lips and cruel eyes. The
Padre spoke w 7 ith. them and called Dicky to
them. He waved to the ladies as he went.
Where w r as he going so early? “Oh, just
a bit of rifle practice with the Arabs!”
The Professor rushed forward. It couldn’t
be —he w 7 as responsible for this boy. Any-
way, the shot might not have come from the
Mission.
The Padre motioned him back. “There is
only one law 7 here, M’sieur —a life for a life.
The chief gave me this —it is the bullet that
killed their tribesman. I believe it is your
particular pattern. I congratulate you on
your marksmanship, Professor!”
Conwav went away slowly between the two
Arabs. He turned to w 7 ave to the little
group standing in the shadow 7 of the gate.
Soon they passed from view behind a sand-
dune.
“Why, they’re shooting already!” cried one
of the women as two shots rang out in quick
succession from the direction of the sand-
dune.
The Padre could bear it no longer, and he
told the white-faced group of w 7 omen the
truth. Slowly they went back to the house
—the blaze of the sun and the glory of earth
and sky as the new day cast off the sombre
shades of night seemed to mock the tragedy
so close at hand.
Within the room there was silence,
broken only by the subdued sobbing of the
officer’s sister. At the table the rug mer-
chant aimlessly shuffled the cards.
The happy laugh of the officer’s little son
roused them suddenly. “Oh, father, look.
I found a penny—such a funny one!”
The Padre took the coin with a hand that
shook. Everyone knew it was the coin that
had served in the night’s drama.
His voice was very low when he spoke
again. , , , . . A
“Messieurs, this com has tw 7 o heads! Ana
M’sieur Conway, w 7 ho gave it to toss, called
‘Tails’!”
Then Professor Horatio Augustus Munro
realised for the first time that love is greater
than knowledge, and achievement less than
sacrifice.

Where the brown hawk sailed- free

And I looked down on colors where the

The reef-gardens glowing, the gardens of the

I forgot singing speech.
My heart could only hold
Blue, blue and burning gold
That shimmered each in each —
Amethysts and purples like the raiment of a
queen,
A tall queen in Avalon, and miracles of

Far down the shallow tide
Curled on beaches bright,
Small waves in lines of light
On sands a-glitter sighed;
Oh, in lines of lucid burning went the azure
of the day!
And down sun-flooded hollows trees danced
in windy play.
Mist-like and far and high,
Islands, purple soft and dim,
Quivered where the sea’s rim
Died swooning in the sky;
And clouds went sailing, sailing in pageantry
of pride—
Galleons of gods they seemed that rode the
heavens wide!
Oh. gardens all aglow,
Coral garden ways,
Now through the sapphire days
My happy dreamings go!
In emerald and turquoise, gold winged, they
wander free;
My dreams have garnered color from the

A RT coming home?” God said to me.
r\ Yea, with a winsome sadness said :
“The starshinc shall thy candle be;
Cherubs will smooth thy cloudy bed.”
I was in love with sin, and so
I shook my head. I answered “No!”
And when I to the tavern came
The bawdy women drinking there
Told of a girl without a name
New come our shameless life to share.
I saw the stranger woman smile,
And swore “You’re mine by right or guile.”
She murmured “You to me!” and made
The lecherous look, the secret sign.
I, as she fled, pursuing, said
“Make you your glorious body mine!”
Heard I a sob? Saw I a tear?
She thrust me back: “Not here; not here!”
Past hill, past gully, bush and mire
She raced; and my exhausted breath
Shrivelled the flowers in my desire.
It seemed I cried from very death:
“When can my arms encompass you?”
“Not here!” she said, and farther flew.
I saw a gate, I saw a light,
I heard far music and I fell.
Then all things faded but a might
Of fear that I had fallen on Hell.
But still I saw her luring eyes
That held the lights of Paradise.
I woke; in your soft arms I lay,
Your mouth upon my mouth was prest.
’Twas you who brought me that hard way
To love and God and quiet rest.
Hungry and bleeding, torn with pain,
I found myself in Heaven again.
“Thou hast come home!” God said to me.
Yea, with a pitying smile He said:
“The starsliine shall thy candle be:
Come, cherubs, smooth their cloudy bed!”
And there was peace. How could I know
That you and God could love me so?

As he stopped and stretched his

“ Follow the line of the dead marines,
And you can't mistake the track.
It’s forty year since I fust come here,
An’ I’ve tramped it day and night;
But I’ve always followed the bottles. I have,
An’ they've always kept me right.

So bear to the right, w’en they comes in

An’ mind you follow the bottles.

But what good is those w’en a sandstorm

Dust of Love.
THE kindly road is soft beneath our feet
With dust of lovers, with a white
disguise
Of lips, and burnished hair,
And innocent, most fair
And passionate lovers' eyes.
Their hands are twined among the spreading
trees,
Their blood is in the splash of sunset stain,
The deep-mouthed voice of seas
Gives back their song
And speeds the chant along—
The secret chanting of their buried pain ;
Under the lovers’ spell the whole world lies.
Under her mesh of hair,
Eve’s body, gleaming fair,
If rooted in rich flowers;
Green grass caresses yet
Some blue-eyed Juliet
Through patient hours ;
Hector dreams where he ran—
Lover, soldier and man—
For hours and hours;
Helen of ancient Troy
Lies still with her gold-haired boy—
Helen, her lips like flowers.
Do lovers, under the road that is white with
dust,
Remember the broken ploughshares are red
with rust.
Remember that swords now idle were supple
and bright,
Remember the shimmer of silver, the flash
of white?
Lovers, awake or asleep,
Lovers, alive or cold.
With hearts still young or grown old,
We who tenderly tread
Over the limbs of the dead.
Dare we forget, where the dew is wet,
Blood of a lover ran red?
We shall remember and kiss.
Tasting your goblet of bliss ;
We shall kneel in the road’s dusty white,
Ir. the road where your feet wandered light:
Then my loye. with her gold-banded head,
And I shall go down to the dead.
And sleep with you, lovers, in some passion-
flower-decked bed.

Camden.
Oil. softly sang the thrushes,
Witli melody a-swoon,
As I came into Camden
One drowsy afternoon.
A breath of summer roses
Was hanging in the street.
And wondrous fair was Camden
With meadows at her feet.
The steepled church was solemn
And dreaming in the sun;
The sleepy bells of Camden
Were chiming one by one.
And ere I heard the music
Those rose-sweet winds caress,
I knew not Camden village
Could hold such loveliness.
So let me pause- in Camden,
And listen to the bells
That chime across the meadows
Into the scented dells.
For peace comes through the morning.
And I must walk with Pain
Before I turn my footsteps
To Camden town again.

When Evening Comes.
WHEN evening like an angel walks
The dim old village street,
And children's homing voices die
In echoes far and sweet,
I watch the homclights softly glow
Between the arching trees
Like lights of love that show the way
O'er life's uncharted seas. "**■
I hear low greetings in the dusk,
The word of friend to friend,
The tender phrase of one who meets
Love at the journey's end.
And o’er the village hearths and homes
I fancy I can see
The angel of the evening breathe
A Benedicite!

A Song of Motherhood.
1 SAW her as an Archway, thronged with
Spears,
Where countless legions marched at break
of day.
Through Motherhood they came, the masters
of the years,
Who held o’er earth dominion and the
sway
Of pomp and power.
God’s Archway, mortared well with blood
and tears
In battle-hour!
I saw her as a Fountain, filled with grief,
Down-dashing all her heart’s red wine of
woe.
A Fountain-head of sorrow, whence the out-
cast and the thief
Drew consolation ’neath the scourgings
and the blow
Of bitter fate.
Life's Fountain, streaming proudly for each
chief
Who bears Earth's weight!
I saw her as a River, surging with a strength
Of human hearts that lapped upon all
lands;
A mighty River, Amazonian in its length,
That seeded all the world with toiling
hands
At bench and forge.
Work’s River, dashing mightily its strength
’Gainst rock and gorge!
I saw her as an Altar, where the sons of men
Bowed down their heads in proud humility.
An Altar-shrine, where all the heroes of the
pen
And sword paid homage at her knee,
And whispered low.
Love’s Altar, raised at length on earth again
In days of woe!
I saw her as great England, mute and sheer,
Surveying all her sons with splendid eyes
That swam with love, and watched each
pioneer
Go forth to build an earthly paradise
Of wider scope!
Great England’s heart! And in her eyes
austere
The larger hope!
I saw her as Australia, strangely sad,
And yet athrill with new, transpassioncd
joys,.
Because on Anzac’s shores and Flanders’
fields she had
Her graves—the graves of countless men
and boys
Who dared and died.
Australia’s heart, filled for each mute, war-
splendid lad
With nameless pride.
I saw her as a Flower, strangely red.
Borne up before the Throne of God by
Christ;
And God Himself was mute, and bowed His
head
Before her majesty, because she sacrificed
Her living heart.
God's Flower of Grace! Lo, where she
droops, carnation-red,
New Caesars start!
I see her as my victress, conqueror
Df oil the living heart and soul of me:
Who hath dominion in mine inmost core.
And holds my baser blood in anguished
fealty.
O love Divine!
Here do I kneel and pray, because she bore
A child of mine.

England.
I THOUGHT that when my stranger-eyes
Beheld this dreamed-of treasure-trove.
With primrose-haunted memories,
With proud and daffodilling love,
I’d laugh and bare my head to English rains,
Bun singing through the green of English
lanes,
And, stooping by a hedge, kiss the sweet
earth
That gave my fathers birth.
But there’s no laughter on my lips.
Nor yet a song; but like a bird
Stumbling on beauty's soul, there slips
Into my mouth a sobbing word—
England! Her fields are furrowed in my
heart.
Her rivers are the sudden tears that start
As to some shadow-quiet place I creep,
Like a shy child, to weep.

The Borrowed Funeral.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE grandmothers of Nicholas William
Don had been dead a decade, but
their filial grandson had resolved that
one of them was to be interred over again.
Nicholas was weary of work, his bones were
broken with labor, and he had been thinking
of a certain stretch of white sand lying under
the warm sun at Elwood, and of the delight
of lounging in it all the long afternoon, with
a certain little Miss Burrows at his left
elbow. Suddenly determination came. He
lurched into the office of Hogan and Co., and
confronted Hogan, who was busy drawing
sandpipers on his blotting-pad.
“Please, boss,” said Nicholas, “me grand-
mother’s dead.”
“Dear me !” said Hogan. “Are you sure she
is quite dead?”
“Dead as a door-nail, boss, and the
funeral’s to-day. I'd like to get off if I can
be spared.”
“There’s none of us that cannot be spared
at a pinch, Nicholas. I. am not wholly essen-
tial myself this morning.”
“Then I s’pose I can go?”
“I suppose you can. Far be it from me to
keep a loving grandson from the obsequies of
his lamented grandparent. You can go, Don.
And I shall be glad to show my respect for
the late lamented lady, too —I shall go with
you.”
“What!” gasped Nicholas. “You want to
go to my grandmother’s funeral?”
“Certainly, and why not? I love a funeral;
I haven’t missed one that had the smallest
claim on me for years, and this one I feel
has a claim on me through one of the most
industrious and conscientious of our em-
ployees. I shall pay my respects to the
remains of your deceased grandmother,
Nicholas.”
“But —but” ——-
“But me no buts. I haven’t been to a
funeral for weeks, and I feel the need of one.
I want to be refreshed with the funeral meats
and the obsequious whisky; I long to be
entertained with the stories the mourners
tell in the mourning-coaches. There is
nothing to keep me; the business will plod
along comfortably in my absence. My mind
is made up.”
“I'm afraid you’ll find it an awful bore.”
“Nicholas, speak out like a man. and if I
am not welcome to your grandmother’s
funeral say so. Far be it from me to seek
to intrude if nobody is glad to have me at
the burying; at the same time I think it a
most ungracious act to deny a well-meaning
friend of the family the right to share in
the general mourning.”
Mr. Hogan was just a little hurt, and his
tone had a trace of righteous indignation
tinged with grief.
Nicholas Don became apologetic. Of course
Mr. Hogan was welcome to the funeral; to
be sure, himself and all the relations would
be glad and proud to have the head of Hogan
and Co. at their funeral.
“Very well tlr n. Don, it is understood that
I go to your grandmother’s burial. Call in
for me when you are ready.”
Nicholas came out of the office feeling
feverish. He sat apart, debating with him-
self what should be done next. To confess
to the boss that he had been guilty of a
base deception in an effort to evade his proper
duties would be to invite the boot,
FROM THE FRYING-PAN INTO THE FIRE.
OLD PUPIL ( meeting past school-teacher) : “Blimey, old Goggleyes,
I always said if I met yon when I grew up I'd punch your
head off; but, Iumme, I think I'll shoal for you until you're
as full as an cgg.”
and Nicholas was very comfortable in this
job. Was there no other way out? Nicholas
thought hard, and came to the conclusion
that there was a way. He must have re-
course to further deceit and wickedness, but
he bad left himself no option. He snatched
up the morning's Age. and his eye raced
down the funeral notices, finally arriving at
one that seemed to suit his purpose. Hogan
was determined to go to the funeral. Very
well; to a funeral he should go.
There was just a tinge of surprise in
Hogan's manner when Nicholas re-appeared
in the office, divested of his apron and his
working coat, and announced himself ready
for the excursion. “If we go at once we
shall be just in the niek.” he explained.
A tram took them to East Melbourne, and
the attitude of Nicholas by the way was
not more chastened than was natural in one
who had just been bereft of the affection of
a near and dear relation. A short walk
brought them to a picturesque villa, before
which was ranged a hearse and two mourn-
ing-coaches, a motor or two and several
rather shabby mendicant cabs.
Here Hogan began to be assailed with
doubts and misgivings. Perhaps, after all,
he was obtruding upon the grief of an in-
genuous young workman. Perchance Nicholas
really had a grandmother and that grand-
mother was having her funeral on this day.
He was quite convinced when Nicholas Don
led him straight into the dining-room, and
offered him drink from an assortment of
bottles on the far end of the table, the near
end being occupied by a sizable coffin such
as a grandmother might inhabit.
“Have a stiff whisky,” said Nicholas, “it
will brace you up!” He served Hogan with
a lone - nobbier and took a longer himself, and
nobody offered any objection.
Having drunk, Nicholas went to the coffin
and bent over it in an attitude of profound
respect. Deftly he wiped one eye: then, hav-
ing paid his respects to the corpse, he took
Hogan’s hat, and had it draped with a heavy
bunch of crepe. His own was similarly
decorated. Everything was going well, the
courage of Nicholas Don revived. He asked
a total stranger to have a drink.
“I will,” was the reply. “I knew the
deceased well. But who the blazes are you?”
It was Nicholas’s first setback.
Nicholas took the stranger a few paces
aside. “The master of ceremonies,” he
said confidentially. “No properly-conducted
funeral is without a master of ceremonies
nowadays. I am put in by the undertaker
to show people round, and make them at
home. Have another whisky.”
It was the only time his authority was
questioned. Most of the people present
accepted him as a fully-authorised mourner,
and in any case they were, as a rule, too
busy with the whisky and biscuits to trouble
their heads about anybody’s right to offici-
ate.
“Have a bit of cake, Mr. Hogan,” said
Nicholas, presenting the plate to his boss.
“Let’s be happy while we may. You know
grandma was the best old soul that ever
lived; but, naturally, at her age this sad
event was long anticipated, and one cannot
mourn for ever. Try the biscuits. Won’t
you take a glass of beer with the cheese?”
A middle-aged woman, red-eyed, and show-
ing a swollen nose, came into , the room, and
the assemblage stood aside for her. She
remained weeping over the coffin.
“My grand-aunt Lucy,” whispered Nicho-
las. “We’re not on the best of terms. Do
you think this a suitable moment to tender
the hand of friendship?”
Nicholas went to the mourner and shook
her warmly by the hand. His grand-aunt
Lucy disregarded him. and went on with her
weeping. The assembled guests watched her
dumbly, refraining from anything more
than a furtive sipping of their whisky
out of consideration for her grief. They
even stopped eating. Conversation was car-
ried on in whispers, from behind reverential
hats. Everybody behaved very much is if
in church —excepting that nobody entirely
neglected the whisky.
The room was darkened; a vase of white
flowers stood on the table as a set-off to the
bottles and glasses; there was a wreath on
the top of the coffin, and Nicholas’s grand-
aunt Lucy was watering it with her tears.
Every now and again the mourner shook her
head and emitted a deep groan. She held a
handkerchief to her swollen nose. It was
thoughtful Nicholas who poured a long nob-
bier of spirit and off-
ered the bereaved lady
a nip. She put it
aside with a gesture.
“Beer, p’raps?” said
Nicholas.
He tried her with a
medium beer, and she
accepted the refresh-
ment, drained the
glass, and resumed her
attitude of melan-
choly.
Nicholas rallied the
company, passing the
whisky round, and
serving with a liberal
hand. Mourners
flocked in. The room
became stifling, but
Nicholas saw to it
that none of the
new-comers went un-
refreslied. He saw to
it that himself was not
left high and dry,
either, and presently
he lost the little feel-
ing of compunction
that had possessed
him. He was quite
happy in the perform-
ance of his self-imposed
duties, and perfectly
at home. Hogan
watched him. a kind of
respect mingling with
the wonder he felt.
He presently discover-
ed that Mr. Don was
arranging the pall-
bearers.
“All you want,” Nic-
holas whispered, “is
blokes that match. You
can't put tall blokes
wi t h short, stocky
blokes, or the coffin
might keel over. As
the majority of the old
lads here are bloeky, we’ll go on a five-feet-
six basis.”
Pie had selected four men of medium height
and ranged them alongside the coffin, when
some slight disagreement of a subdued sort
arose, the pall-bearers having already, it
seemed, been selected by the chief mourner,
the lady with the swollen nose. However,
the lady selected her subjects without any
thought of matching, and had chosen one
very tall man. two shorts and a medium.
Nicholas had only to point out the absurd
angles at which the coffin would be carried as
a result of this incompatibility to have his
way, and the coffin was borne none too

soberly but with all due solemnity from the
house and deposited in the hearse.
It was Nicholas who piloted Hogan into
the second mourning-coach. “I ought to be
in the first,” said he, “but perhaps you would
not like to travel alone.”
Other mourners crowded in. but Nicholas
held his own with imperturbability, and pre-
sently, to his great satisfaction, the corthge
moved from the late residence of the de-
ceased.
A heavily ereped man with a split lip
started the stories. Nicholas contributed one
or two to keep tin' ball rolling, and Hogan
seemed a happy man. At the graveside
fresh doubts assailed Nicholas, but by main-
taining a freshet of conversation he contrived
to divert his boss’s attention from anything
the clergyman might have to say which would
be of an incriminating nature, and eventu-
ally the earth was heaped over the body of
Nicholas Don’s grandmamma.
Nicholas and Hogan returned to the city
on the hearse. They were put down in Swan-
ston-street.
“You need not return to the warehouse,
Don,” said Hogan. “T will leave you to your
grief. But when you look in to-morrow you
might explain how it is that your grand-
mother came to die under an alias.”
“Under an alias?” moaned Don.
“Yes, the party we have just buried was
named John James Winterbottom.”
Nicholas uttered a groan expressive of
great mental torment and went away.
EDWARD DYSON.
The Cherub.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
J OHNSON was bjisy at the end of a nine-
foot tunnel that he had chiselled
through a bluff ..on the precipitous side
of a cascade, from the top of which he would
guide water in race and fiuming to his mine.
Prospecting alone in the wild North Queens-
land hills, he had found a patch of rich tin-
bearing wash that was going to make his
fortune, or, at least, buy him a farm Too-
woomba way, and the dead work necessary
to bring on the water was almost accom-
plished. Another week and a stream would
be running merrily along the cedar fiuming,
and the earth race, and over the face of his
workings. Another month, and he would
have a ton of tin ready for the packer to
take away !
He was not thinking of farm or fortune
just then, however ; he was wriggling about
on a precarious footing, like a fly on a wall,
trying to fix a 9ft. section of fiuming, known
as a box—a box without ends or top, measur-
ing 2ft. across, the sides rising Gin. The
tunnel had been made to take it. A stout
rope, which had assisted him in raising it
from rock to rock, from crevice to crevice,
was attached to a strong root near by, and
the end with the slip-knot he had put round
his waist —a precautionary measure lest, in
his exertions, lie might slip and go slithering
down the rocks.
The box was halfway in; and, although he
eased, cajoled and lifted, it would not go
farther. A stone, lie decided; so, pushing
the rope down his body, he lay flat in the
box, and drew himself along until he could
reach over the edge. It was a round pebble;
his fingers found it at once. Dislodged, it
rolled, taking the box with it to its appointed
place just outside the tunnel, where it:
fitted perfectly into the next section,
which, ingeniously clamped to the rock-
face for the next loft., was the end of the
fiuming and the beginning of the earth-
race. Johnson, bumped flat when the box
started, was immediately bumped up again,
receiving a blow from the top of the low
tunnel. The knock sent him down once
more, unconscious or dead, in the most
comfortable of wooden cradles that a man
could wish for.
After a time 'lie opened his eyes, feeling
strangely light for a man who turned the
scale at fourteen stone, and strangely young
for one who had experienced thirty years of
chance and change on Northern mineral
fields. A creeper, falling over the tunnel
mouth, tickled his neck. Turning his head
he raised it on his arm. and gazed over the
edge of the box at the great flood of grey-
green water falling past him far below. lie
felt happy, with a quaint dreaminess; he
knew that his body was in the tunnel and
only his head outside, and —yes. that was the
cause of his present bliss. It was the
stomach, legs and chest of a man that got
him into trouble, of course. Just the head
and a few light feathers, and one would be a
cherub.
But then the thought occurred to him
that he was an ordinary tin-scratcher, and
would have to get out
of the box and maki
a living. He tried to
draw himself forward
so that he could rise,
but his body did not
respond to the effort.
He tried again;
it was no good.
Then he reached along
the box and felt his
legs. They were lying
straight and rigid, and
something clipped his
ankles. Another half-
hearted effort, another
failure to move; then
he lay still, and
watched the swallows
flying up and down the
glorious water-slide,
watched the rainbow
colors hanging like a
jewelled curtain over
the cascades, watched
the mists glittering in
a thousand sunbeams
that rose from deep
blue pools at the base
of the cliffs.
Lord, what a fool
a man was to work
and slave, never giving
himself time to look at
these things that were
more real than he —
things that had been for ages, that would
endure for ages! The sun, the wind, the
water were the things that mattered. And
the birds —they never sweated in muck and
misery for a sordid living! Johnson wished
lie was a swallow, flying about the waterfall,
w r ith the spray and sun on his wings.
I-lis head was out of the tunnel, his arms
were all right. What the deuce was holding
him? Begs and great hulking body, he hated
them—legs and arms working and grinding
to keep the beastly stomach full; and they
couldn’t do it comfortably, either. Food—
salt beef and damper, a few spuds and
onions, and tea! His brain sickened with
disgust. The body that was behind him in
the tunnel —let it stay !
Blood was soaking through his hair and
falling drop by drop on the bottom board:
but his head held no pain, only a light hap-
piness and the queer thoughts of the quarter-
conscious.
Cherubim had no bodies, only heads and
wings. The wings grew when the head was
away from the clogging body. Now he
knew!
He felt for his knife, drew it from his belt
and opened it. A sharp, strong cut. all
round the sinewy neck, a quick twist with his
big hands, and then those hands could stay
with the rest of the bodily incubus in the
tunnel. lie felt carefully round for the
right place. There were little stiff tufts
of hair behind his ears; the quills would
start growing there. His eyes were tixed on
the swallows in dreamy ecstasy. Up and
down they flew. He tried the knife with his
linger. It -was very sharp. Then he in-
serted it into the side of his throat. It was
so sharp it did not hurt him a bit. He had
thought it might, and wondered at this as the
knife bit deeper.
A wrench with two big, powerful hands,
and it was off. Then he felt tendrils curl
round his ears and cheeks, soft touches of
downy fluff. Poor old dirty body! He did
not hate it now, only felt sorry for its wasted
labor and ugliness. A nimbus formed, feathers
that moved and quivered. Then Johnson’s
head spread beautiful" grey-white wings, and
flew, in rapture unspeakable, to the top of
the waterfall.
TJp and down he flew, in the sheer joy of
being free. The jewelled spray splashed
on his wings and face; the mist passed over
him like a breath of Paradise, lie perceived
now that the swallows were cherubim-wings
and children’s faces. Then he caught sight
of his own reflection in the rock pool; it
was a boy’s bright face, before toil and sin
had spoiled its fine frank roundness and its
possibilities.
MADE A HABIT OF IT.
“I was so proud of Jack — that was a splen-
did story he told at lunch, to-day .”
“Yes, dear. I always laugh over that story.”
The cherubim clustered, darted and dived,
;md Johnson was deliriously happy, beyond
all dreams of fortune or of a farm down
Toowoomba way.
* » * *
Old Joe Savage came up to borrow a ham-
mer, and followed the race to see how John-
son was getting on. At the end of the earth
race he peered along (lie first section of fliini-
ing. and called to the man whose head pro-
truded from the tunnel. How it came to be
there when we know that, graced with wings,
it was flying up and down the falls, is a
mystery. Receiving no answer, he walked
along the box, to discover Johnson uncon-
scious, in a pool of blood. He got help
from the next claim, and they found that
the man s ankles were fastened to the slip-
knot. which had tightened, and held him as
last as a roped horse. A wound in the
head and a scratch in the neck were the only
injuries, but lie had bled a lot. and it was
some time before a flicker of life stirred in
the inanimate body.
It was a reluctant cherub that was re-
called from its gambols and taken to John-
son s humpy; and it was some hours later
lien a throaty, indignant voice delivered
itself to the anxious watchers. “You orter
have left me alone !" it said. “I was all right
and happy! Now I’ve got to begin sloggin'
all over again !”

That was picked up by yours truly
As he toured the sea for topics—
Yo-heave-ho-ing every minute,
As a good ship's master orter,
In his brig the Wanton Linnet —
From a man they called the Snorter.
Once the Reverend Ananias
Peter Boggs, a parson pious,
With keen zeal to Yum-tum-tu-le went on
missionising bent.
He had heard that human tillage
There awaited Christian pillage;
And he aimed to turn its village
To a Christian settlement,
Where the poor and simple nigger
Would maintain his portly figure
In a sanctity untroubled
By the white world’s discontent.
His reception was impressive.
With a friendliness aggressive,
All the simple heathen hailed him when
he landed on their shores.
With their smiles they tried to charm him,
And they showed no wish to harm him ;
But a thing that did alarm him
Was the champing of their jaws.
Yes, whatever text he quoted
On his ample form they gloated ;
And the parson—far from simple—
Very early guessed the cause.
Sucking at a well-used fish-bone
While they dreamt about his wish-bone,
Well the missionary guessed it that some
heathens slept at night;
And their greedy looks he noted
When, apparently devoted,
To his hut they daily floated
With rich foods for his delight.
Well he knew each dusky sinner
Looked upon him as a dinner
For a future date—the knowledge
Filled his spirit with affright.
He decided that the matter
Was they wished him even fatter
Ere they sent him to the cook-pot that
now loomed before his eyes;
And, resolved upon their beating,
Still their food with glad smiles greeting,
Boggs grew chary in his eating,
And he took to exercise.
Soon his disappearing middle
Showed him fitter than a fiddle —
Fit to run in any contest
For a big Olympic prize.
But the niggers twigged the swindle
When they saw their dinner dwindle,
And resolved to do their feasting ere it
dwindled any more.
So the parson saw them coming,
With their turn-turns tum-tum-tumming—
Smelt, in fact, the mighty humming
Which all niggers goes before;
Swift discarded all his garments,
Made a dash to leave the varmints,
While they streamed behind him, yelling,
As he fled along the shore.
Round and round the isle they chased him,
Keen to skewer, bake and baste him —
Yelling, prancing, hooting, dancing, they
pursued him might and main.
Though he’d lost his wind, mayhap, he
Still fought on —determined chappie !
Till on making the next lap lie
Ever caught it up again.
And! the niggers saw their dinner
Every hour grow thinner, thinner,
As his tissue sweated from him,
While they chased him all in vain.
Quite exhausted with their hopping,
Niggers constantly were dropping—
They would fall to sleep, but waking would
once more join in the chase;
Yet the flying missionary
Kept on running like a fairy,
Till 1 his figure grew so airy
That its lines were hard to trace;
Till he’d vanished so completely
That some niggers, running fleetly,
Passed him by and did not know it—
He had sweated into space!
Full of adjectives most gory.
Snorter rounded off the story:
“There’s an empty isle where Yankees now
are putting in some toil.
There’s a syndicate been floated.
Backed by moneyholders bloated,
AH its energies devoted
To shaft-sinking in the soil.
For the grease rings all about it
Seem to them—they do not doubt it—
As the plainest indication
That they’re on the. track of oil!”

HAMER.
The Luck of the Ladye
Lorimel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STEAMERS of every sort and condition
were berthed alongside the wharves
that extend from Dawes Point to
Balmain Bridge. Oversea liners, inter-
state passenger carriers, tramps; steamers
from the mean, pot-bellied bearer of hay and
hides and hogs to the gorgeous floating cara-
vanserai that casts off to the merry music of
a band and the snapping of a thousand rib-
bons. Amid all this array the sweet lines
of the barque Ladye Lorimel captivated the
eye of seaman and landsman alike. From
the trucks of her lofty masts to where the
water lapped her shapely sides, and from her
beautifully-carved figurehead to the scroll-
work on her finely-moulded stern, she dif-
fused a sea-comeliness seldom to be seen in
these latter days of steam propulsion. Nov.-
all but elbowed off the seas by the grosser
shapes that answered the insistent call for
despatch, she proudly awaited her fate.
With nothing but the magic of her cunningly-
fashioned hull, and the skill of the hands
that controlled it. the bellying white canvas
and the winds of Heaven that filled it, she
had logged, day in day out, over long-
periods, runs that few of these unlovelier
carriers of commerce had eoualled even
in their steam trials. - But winds arc fickle;
whereas feed a fire of coals beneath a hissing
cauldron, and, lo! wind and tide shall not
prevail.
Forty years ago, when the Seven Seas
knew her sisters whose names were spoken
in the ports of the w r orld, she broke out her
numbers off Sydney South Head on her
notable maiden voyage. She had left her
home port a ship untried, and there she was
one of the elect of the sea—a clipper! But
the waters of the world had suffered a sea-
change, and now she had just discharged
what looked to be her last cargo.
A man who had graduated from Youth
to Old Age in the strict testing of his love
for the Ladye Lorimel paced disconsolately
the poop-deck, which he had trod since first
she hoisted her house flag. He puffed slowly
at his pipe, pausing frequently in his pacing
while his eye roved fondly over his com-
mand.
The mate came aft and stood by his chief.
“Main t’gallant mast’s sprung, sir,” he re-
marked, gazing aloft. “Shall I send it dowm
when we’re in the stream?”
“Better leave it. Mr. Maylon.” There was
hopelessness in the Old Man’s voice; and
he moved away towards his quarters.
An ancient steward, surely the oldest
steward afloat, came forward presently from
the cabin with the air of one bearing tidings
of moment.
“Auction sale on the thirtieth,” he s/iid,
leaning against the rail. “Cap’n’s jest got
a telegram. There’s no ’ope.”
The sailmaker made several false stitches
and unpicked them, whispering cogent oaths
in a soft, almost caressing, undertone.
There was a long and oppressive silence.
Then the boatswain crystallised tin l thoughts
that were engaging every mind aboard the
barque at that moment by saying suddenly:
“Now, if only all ’ands could raise enough
money 'tween us for ter buy the Ladye!
She oughter go cheap if these ’ere Jews only
want ’cr for a blarsted ’ulk.”
The days slid by until came the 20th
of January, 1914. To-morrow was to decide
the fate of the Ladye Lrfrimel. The captain
sat in his state-room covering sheets of note-
paper with speculative figuring. He had
been engaged for days trying to demonstrate
to his own doubting mind that, provided
none of a host of contingencies arose, he
could purchase the Ladye Lorimel with
£ll4O, which sum represented the whole of
his savings, together with those of his two
officers. But even if the purchase was pos-
sible, how was he to refit and victual, obtain
a charter and sign on a crew? Charters
were not easily obtained for sailing bottoms.
In. desperation he threw down his pen and
went on deck. The thought that his beloved
vessel was soon to pass from his command
weighed so heavily upon him that he did
not observe a sharp-eyed little man aboard
casting appraising glances in all directions.
In the waist stood another man annotating
hurriedly in a book. If these strangers had
been ghouls bent upon a most unspeakable
act of desecration the glances which the
little group at the galley-door darted at them
could scarcely have been more censorious.
The captain, who was now aware of the
significant inspection that was in progress,
looked forward dejectedly. It was only a
matter of hours now. To-morrow his charge
might be given over to the iconoclastic hands
that would rend her asunder. At best she
could not be more than a coal hulk. And
the picture of the symmetrical hull disfigured
by a hideous donkey-engine, her well-set
spars gone, the saloon despoiled of its oak
panelling and given over to a hulk-keeper—•
it was proving too mqch for him.
He came out of these melancholy abstrac-
tions to find that the group of old seamen
had come aft and now paused at the foot of
the port ladder.
The boatswain, by virtue of his seniority,
was the spokesman.
“Can we ’ave a word with y’, sir?”
“Yes, bos’n ; come up here.”
The party arrived on the poop, and the
boatswain continued :
SUFFERED FROM SPECKS IN FRONT.
THE QUACK: “There doesn’t seem much the matter with
you.”
THE GOOSE : “Yes, doctor, I feel all right. But I always
feel bad when I feel well, because I know I am
going to feel worse afterwards.”
“We wanted to say. sir, as ’ow it’s jest
knocked us all of a ’eap. We ’card you
was tkinkin’ of buyin’ the Ladye, sir, so
we’ve ’ad wot y’ might call a tarpaulin
muster for’ard, to see wot we could raise to
’elp. We’ve got —let me see, ’ow much?”
The boatswain looked at a piece of paper
in his hand.
“Two ’undrcd and”
“Two thousand!” snapped old Ben Fornit,
the sailmaker, breaking the silence he had
preserved for three days.
“Two ’undred and” the boatswain be-
gan again.
“Two thousand!” corrected the sailmaker
sharply.
Master and men stared in surprise, and
old Ols Olson, the carpenter, took a pace
backwards and looked the sailmaker up and
down exclaiming:
“Yimminy! Ay tank we has ’noder Yonny
Rockyfellcr. What das two t’ousand you
speak, Sails? Das no time make yoke ! Two
t'ousand gran’modders !”
“Well, it’s this way, sir,” the sailmaker
addresser! the captain in "Four-

your ship,’ and ’e ’ands me a cheque for two
thousand pound. Take it an’ welcome, sir,
and don’t let them sliipbreakers git the

“Thank you, sailmaker. Thank you, my
lads; but I couldn’t take your money. I’m
afraid we’ll just have to let the Ladye Lori-
mel go. It’s very fine of you, and I’ll never
forget it. If it was my own money I was
risking I would be tempted to go ahead. But
I understand those two men you saw for-
ward are both determined on having the
barque. They’ve got more money than we
have, and coal hulks with sound hulls are in
demand. It’s a case of Greek meeting Greek
when those two men are after a ship. Rival
lightermen. I believe one of them has de-
clared that lie’s going to have the Ladye
Lorimel’s bell in his dining-room and her
figurehead on his lawn if it costs him a small
fortune to do it. Besides, expenses and in-
surances are high: freights are low. Still,
if you want me to I’ll go fully into the
matter. I don’t know what it would be
possible to get the vessel for”
“Well, there’s a reserve of seven hundred
—dear -me, I should never have told you
that!” A jovial voice behind them turned
the party on their heels to face the speaker.
Thomas Trevallan, of Trevallan and Char-
teris, shipping agents—and agents for the
Ladye Lorimel —came forward from where he
had been standing unobserved abaft the
mizzen mast. A little man with cheeks like
those of a prime Jonathan apple, with a
plastic mouth as ready to
shape into instantaneous
smiles as to deliver engaging
speech in his well-known
rhetorical mode, pithy and
convincing. He was an old
friend of the captain's ; they
both hailed from the same
part of Cornwall. Favoring
the group with a disarming
smile, he addressed the ship-
master.
“I must apologise, Cap-
tain Carfax, for being an in-
voluntary eavesdropper, and
hearing the whole of this
amazing interview. You may
be surprised, knowing the re-
lationship I bear to this
vessel, but no one would be
more pleased than I to see
you and these members of
your crew acquire the
barque— er—well, at the
lowest possible price. It
would indeed be a pity if she
must haul down the ensign
which she has flown for so
long and with such distinc-
tion. But if she is to do
that so that she may hoist
the Australian flag, and sail
out of this port of registry
—then that would be a
happy consummation. A
most happy consummation.
Captain. As one not entirely ignorant of
such matters, I might add, if you will par-
don me, that I consider the proposal to pur-
chase and carry on the barque not an im-
practicable one.” The rubicund face broke
into a genial smile. “I think I’ll go and
look the barque over,” he said, descending to
the main deck.
On either side of the forecastle-head the
prospective buyers continued their inspec-
tion. One was intent upon an assessment of
the port anchor. The other turned the flaked
cable with an inquiring foot. Both behaved
as men determined to appear unaware of
each other’s presence.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Isenstein. How d’ye
do, Mr. Yard? A beautiful vessel, is she
not. gentlemen? Well found, sound”
“Opinions might differ,” growled Mr.
Isenstein, who always had deprecatory re-
marks ready for such occasions. When a
vendor began praising his wares it was a
case not only of Caveat emptor, but also of
Caveat vendor, for Mr. Isenstein could be
very unpleasant when they tried to lay it on
too thick. _ „ . .
The amiable Mr. Trevallan was not at
all disconcerted.
“A fine vessel and a famous one, gentle-
men ! Did you ever hear the full history of
the Ladye Lorimel? It's a wonderful story.
Perhaps in all the annals of the British
merchant service there has been in our time
no more romantic
object than the
splendid craft we
are now aboard"—
“No sentiment in
business!”
“Yes, Mr. Iseu-
steii*. there is ! In
this instance, at
least, there is sen-
timent. Is this
wonderful old clip-
per to be converted
into a coal hulk?
Then, if so, gentle-
men. she’ll prove a
costly one”
“V y, how’s
that?” Isenstein's
interest was
aroused to such an
extent that he
exchanged
glances with his
Dusiness rival,
whose presence up
to that moment he
had appeared not
to notice.
“Because of that
very sentiment
that you profess to
scorn, Mr. Isen-
stcin. There are
interests in Syd-
ney that will not
allow this ship to
be destroyed if
money can prevent
it.”
Both men knew
Trevallan to be an
important figure in
shipping circles.
They also knew
him to be a man of
diplomatic skill.
As an agent for the
ship he might try
to bring about
an inflation of the barque’s price.
That, perhaps, was natural. But to
attempt the elimination of two potential
bidders was not. One thing could explain that:
Trevallan must himself be interested, finan-
cially, in some project to purchase the vessel.
That probably meant big shipping interests;
and big shipping interests meant big capital.
“She’d make a fine training-ship,
wouldn’t” Trevallan checked the com-
pletion of this sentence, and in the corner
of his eye noted that Isenstein stabbed his
elbow swiftly into his competitor’s ribs.
As a finale to his declamation, Mr. Tre-
vallan blew his- nose lustily and walked aft,
endeavoring to reconcile his present attitude
with the duties he owed the owners of the
vessel. The outcome of this casuistical effort
was that the owners, having made much
money out of the barque, and being ready to
throw her aside now that her best profit-
earning days were done, should not be con-
sidered before the old faithful few who in
calm and storm • had proved their love for
the Ladye Lorimel.
The auction sale was not a success—in
any case, an auction sale held in a stuffy,
newly painted room in midsummer is hardly
likely to be. The few who endured the swel-
tering Turkish-bath atmosphere left fearing
syncope; and from that hour the barque
passed into the hands of the Ladye Lorimel
Ship Company—a strange syndicate in which
the sailmaker held more shares than his
captain.
The Ladye Lorimel secured a charter —
Newcastle to the West Coast of South
America with coal—and a month later strode
gracefully past Nobby’s and over the eastern
horizon. Thirty days out she encountered
a heavy storm. It looked to be the end of the
Ladye Lorimel; but one morning she crept
into sight of Valparaiso, after 2,50 days at
sea. Her maintop-gallant mast had gone by
the board, and her foretop sail was in rib-
bons. Even now, -with the towing hawser
aboard, it seemed that Nemesis must at last
overtake her, for the charter would never pay
for the heavy expenses of this protracted
trip. The fateful writ would surely be
nailed to her mast, and the arrested ship be
lost forever to her present owners.
The pilot—an old Scotsman —came aboard.
To the captain’s inquiry as to freights he
named a surprising figure. Asked again, he
repeated the amazing quotation.
“Ah, yais. Freats arr wcel up sin’ the
war.” said the pilot.
“War? What war?” asked Captain Car-
fax, and learned for the first time of'the
titanic struggle in Europe.
_ The Ladye Lorimel sailed for Cardiff with
nitre, a valuable, and -profitable cargo when
allied guns were impotent in their hunger for
explosives. If the barque got safely to her des-
tination she would be well on the credit side
of her ledger.
The North Atlantic was . foggy ; and the
curtain lifted one day to reveal a sea tragedy.
A British steamer lay about a cable’s length
before the bows of the Ladye Lorimel. Be-
tween the two vessels, and immediately ahead
of the oncoming barque, was a German sub-
marine. The wind had just freshened, and
the Ladye Lorimel had responded with a
foaming forefoot. Captain Carfax looked
straight ahead, and uttered not a word. The
man at the Avheel looked imploringly at the
mate.. The mate stared in amazement at the
captain; then he rushed across and seized his
commander by the arm.
“D’ye see it, sir? A submarine! Right
ahead!”
“Yes. mister. I see it! Take the wheel
yourself, Mr. Maylon! Steady as you go!
I’ll trust in Providence and the luck of the
Ladye Lorimel!”
Perhaps it was due to the aberration that
may affect the keenest mind in a great crisis.
It may have been panic. It may have been
the only course to take in that fateful
moment. Perhaps his engines were tem-
porarily out of order. Whatever the cause
it will never be known why the commander of

U 971 began to submerge before he went
ahead or astern. The terrific concussion that
all aboard the barque expected did not occur.
There was a dull thud; a slight tremor ran
through the ship; after that a succession of
tliumps along her keel as if some cylindrical
object was rolling over and over beneath her.
Then her rudder was almost unshipped, and
bubbling disturbances, oily patches and swirl-
ing vortices appeared upon the surface of
the sea astern of her. The mate put the
helm over desperately, and the Ladye Lori-
mel’s quarter missed the stern of the steamer
by so little space that a man could have
sprung aboard her.
The steamer’s captain had run aft, and
leaned over the rail above her counter. He
stared into Captain Carfax’s face—then dis-
tant about three yards—and shouted "Well
done, sir! By the Lord Harry, that was
proper Black Ball style!” A wild burst of
cheering drowned the rest.
Then down the wind as the barque drew
away came the words: “I’m. sinking, Cap-
tain ! Bullion —I’ve got two million pounds
worth of bullion!”
With a deck crowded with men, a pile of
bullion boxes against the break of the poop,
and every stitch of canvas drawing freely,
the Ladye Lorimel left the scene of disaster,
as the steamer took her final plunge.
At daylight next morning she was off
Land’s End. Three hours later the dull
boom of a gun came out of the north-west,
and Captain Carfax hugged tin' iron-bound
Cornish coast as only a Cornishman would.
At three bells in the forenoon watch a steady
sou’-wester sent the barque swiftly on her
course. But the strong wind had cleared the
sea of fog, the sun shone brightly, and pres-
ently there appeared on the port quarter a
rapidly-moving ellipse of foam.
For a while the terrible race continued.
But the fleet Lady Lorimel must be at last
outmatched. On came the submarine. Be-
tween that engine of destruction and the
cruel leesliore the luck of the Ladye Lorimel
must at last desert her!
Trevallan never heard the details of the
loss of the Ladye Lorimel. The bare
announcement of her end had come at a time
when every day had its dismal toll of mari-
time disaster.
Eight years later he returned to his native
Cornwall. He set out one day to tramp to
Polgarth village. Passing along the narrow
ribbon of a track that skirts the cliff above
Polgarth Sound, he came upon an old man
who, seated upon a boulder near the path,
puffed contentedly at his pipe. A trim old
nautical figure, clad in a jacket of heavy
pilot cloth embellished with brass buttons.
A badge cap sat jauntily over the grey hair.
It was Captain Carfax!
Then Trevallan sat down to hear of the
adventures of the Ladye Lorimel.
“And we got a good reward for salvaging
the bullion,” the captain continued, “and the
Admiralty prize-money amounted to a fine
thing. Then there was the cargo of nitre”
“Eh? What’s that!” Trevallan started
and turned to face the captain. He had been
gazing sadly upon the grey expanse of the
Irish Sea that held, as lie thought, the rust-
TOO MUCH LUCK FOR ONE FAMILY.
DISAPPOINTED COCKY (after the judging): “I ain't
makin' any complaint, Mr. Ross; bat when th'

in-law, an' the fust prize fer marrers to 'is wife’s
grandfather; it makes per think a bit, that's all."
ing husk of the Ladye Lorimel. “What's
that about the nitre, Carfax?” For once, in
his excitement, Trevallan was not rhetorical.
For answer the captain pointed down the
sheer precipice to the sound below. Tre-
vallan peered over, and to his astonishment
gazed down upon the Ladye Lorimel; she
lay bolt upright as if she floated. The Aus-
tralian ensign, well starred, flaunted amid
the gathering dusk of the sound. As Tre-
vallan looked a whistle-blast sounded and a
figure on the poop hauled down the flag.
“Sunset!” said the captain, and there was
silence for a moment.
Then, the old shipmaster knocked out his
pipe and began to speak. “It was this or
nothing. As a boy I’d been about the sound
a bit. Bird-nesting and the like. One day
I sailed a small craft in there when I was
home after my first voyage. Polgarth folk
called it tempting Providence to go in there
at any time. But I’d found that if you went
in there on a flood-tide —and kept your head
—it would carry you straight on to that
shingly beach where you see the Ladye lying
now. That was with a 30-foot yawl; but I
never thought I’d try it with a two thousand-
ton barque. When the Square Head came
for me I cracked on and headed the barque
straight through that narrow passage. The
Dutchman must ha’ thought I was mad.
There was the biggest tide coming in that
I’d ever known. The wind was strong on
the quarter —where the Ladye liked it. She
went straight as an arrow through the broil.
It’s all loose shingle down there. Deep—
the Lord knows how deep! The Ladye drove
into it like a road-mender’s shovel drives
into fine metal. I’ve got all anchors out in
case an extra-big tide should ever shift her;
but I don’t think it will. She’s stood firm as
a rock now for eight years.”
“Well, well!” murmured Trevallan as
lie glanced at the fading light in the west and
arose. “I suppose you live in Polgarth vil-
lage, Captain,” he added, taking a final look
at the Ladye Lorimel.
“Oh no, I live aboard.”
“Alone? Surely not!”
“Oh, no! There’s the mate, the bo'sn,
carpenter, sailmaker, cook and my steward.
The second mate went to sea again—he’s
not an old man, you know.”
EDWARD SCOTT HOLLAND.
One Evening when Supper
Was Late.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A FIERCE westerly bit its way round
every corner of the homestead, and
into every nook and cranny of the
hills and the hollows; it whistled among the
boughs of the tall trees, and howled and
hummed the whole day through. Horses and
cattle, their hair on end, their backs humped,
crouched behind the big ironbarks and gums;
the 'roos sheltered along the gullies or lay
in the long, rank grass.
Dad, in an old rag coat, was ploughing the
“seventeen acres” for the third time; and
with the wind whistling up his trouser-legs,
and penetrating the very marrow of liis
bones, lie couldn't go nearly fast enough to
kecii himself warm.
“Dear me!" he’d remark to Joe, whenever
he reached the farther headland, “I never
knoo a day like it afore!”
“N-nor m-me!” Joe would answer wisely.
“It's snowin’ somewhere not fur away—
nothin’ surer ’n thet!”
“It mu-must so, Dad. D-d-don’t it
m-m-makc your n-nose w-water!” And Joe
would crouch an inch or two nearer a fire
he was keeping going to burn out a stump
that had long been a landmark. “I s-s-say.
Dad,” he would add feelingly, “I hope they’ll
have s-s-somethin’ hot f-for s-s-supper, don’t
you V” Then Dad would cast a glance at the
sullen-looking sun sinking down through the
grey, icy sky, and, taking his hands from the
pockets of his old coat, would start the
team again.
lie kept the plough going till after the
sun went down —till the gloomy, freezing
night set in, and he could hardly see the
horses.
“I'll think we’ll go now, Joe,” he. called,
starting to unyoke, “an' get out o’ this darn
wind, an" see what they got fer supper fer
us.”
“If it w-wasn’t f-fer th’ supper, Dad, I'd
ss-stop here all 11-night” ; and, giving himself
a final warming, front and" back, and then
stuffing his hands into the rear of his pants,
Joe mooched off, following Dad and the
horses over the ploughed field, and keeping
close enough to make a breakwind of them.
As they reached the barn, which was also
the harness-slied and often the fowl-roost,
Mother and Sarah hurried in through the
sliprails, the fierce wind sporting with their
skirts and hats. They had been out spend-
ing the afternoon with Mrs. Anderson. Mrs.
Anderson had a new baby ; and no kind of
weather would keep Mother
and Sarah inside When there
was a new baby any where
about. That’s where women are
different from men. Mother
and Sarah had walked and
trotted a mile and a half over
a stony ridge, and were out of
breath and excited. They were
excited because they knew there
was no supper ready, and they
were “blessing” Mrs. Anderson
for having persuaded them to
“stay a little longer, till Ander-
son comes back from the railway
—any minute now—or he’ll be
quite put out at not seeing you.”
Reaching the house, they
pushed the door in, and pushed
it shut again to keep the howl-
ing wind out.
“Hurry, girl! Hurry there!”
Mother cried. "Light the lamp
and let us get a fire on.”
Sarah groped ill the dark for
the kerosene lamp, while Mother,
shaking and shivering, stood in
the centre of the floor. Mother
was thinking of Dad. Mother
always thought more of Dad
when she knew’ lie was liable
to profanely explode in a just
cause.
“Be careful, now, you don't
knock it down, girl.”
But Sarah didn’t knock it
down. She located it with unerring domes-
tic instinct, and placed it safely on the
table. Then she found the matches, and
struck one, and Mother gave a sigh of relief.
But when Sarah lit the wick and adjusted
the globe, the lamp proved a fraud. It
nearly went out.
“Whatever is the nutter with it? Turn
it. up higher!” And expecting Dad to bowl
in every second, before they could get a
move on, Mother shook the more.
Sarah turned the wick higher, then lower,
then higher again, but it remained a fraud.
She struck another match and examined
the bowl.
“Dammit!' she said, “there’s no kerosene
in it!” Sarah when she got excited often
spoke like Dad.
“Sarah!” Mother reprimanded.
“Well, there isn’t, Mother! It’s all water
that’s in it.” For economic reasons, Dad,
several evenings past, had poured the water
in to raise the drop of oil that there was to
the stump of a wick.
Boor Mother nearly dropped dead. "And
there is no more kerosene in the house,” she
moaned.
But, like Dad, Sarah was resourceful. She
struck more matches, and unearthed an old
slush-lamp with lots of fat and a corn-cob
moleskin wick in it. and in no time had it
burning and smelling like a bush-fire.
“Now we’ll be right, Mother. You start
setting the table, while I go out and get
some wood and make a fire.” Sarah would
have made a great general if women only had
their rights and could be sent to war instead
of men.
Out the back door she bounced into the
howling blizzard of darkness and started
groping and scratching for chips at the wood-
heap—or, rather, where the woodheap had
been a week before. Another load was over-
due ; but Dad and the horses were finishing
the seventeen acres before bringing it. Sarah
bad nearly collected an armful when Joe,
having left his parent on his knees cutting
greenstuff with a hook, came creeping along
with his head down against the wind, and
with gloomy suspicions that all was not well
with the hot supper.
He collided astern with Sarah just as she
was scratching for a last chip, and knocked
her on her head. They both got a great

fright; but when Sarah screamed Joe recog-
nised her voice.
“Is that y-y-you, S-Sarah?” he gasped.
“Yes, you d—n young fool!” And Sarah
gathered herself up, and groped for the scat-
tered chips.
“Go and find some big wood for the fire,’’
she commanded, “and look sharp about it 1”
“W-wood for th* f-f-fireV” he stuttered sur-
prisedly. “Haven't y’ g-g-got s-s-supper
r-ready yet?”
“We are getting it now,” Sarah snapped.
“Go and find some wood, and bring it in,
quick.”
“W-where have y’ b-b-been till this
hour?”
“Mind your own business, and - do what
you’re told!” and Sarah hurried inside again,
to hang over the fireplace, starting the fire,
while Mother, her hat now abandoned, and
with a large apron on, rattled knives and
forks and crockery on the table.
Presently Joe, shivering like a leech, en-
tered, carrying all the wood he. was able to
put his hands on —most of it green, wretched
ends of saplings, the remains of some timber
Dad had used up in the making of swingle-
trees.
“Couldn’t you find some dry pieces?”
Sarah snapped, then started piling the best
of them around the kindling chips. “Run
out and see can you find some dry pieces in
the old shed,” she added.
“S-see?” Joe demurred. “How can any-
one s-s-see out there to-night?”
“Well, go and try—it you want any sup-
per !”
“I’ve a. g-good mind to g-go to b-b-bed till
s-s-supper is r-ready..”
“You do, and you’ll get none at all,” and
Sarah blew the chips into a blaze.
Joe reluctantly went out into the cold
wind and the darkness again, and in a few
minutes struggled back with several long dry
palings that bore evidence of having been
roosted on from one end to the other by
the fowls.
“PoohI” Sarah grimaced. “What did you
bring them for?”
“To p-p-put on th’ f-f-fire, of course!
W-what else d-did you want them f-for?”
Joe, his eyes resting on the palings, grim-
aced himself. But it wasn’t a time for
picking and choosing, so on to the fire they
had to go, and Sarah swung the kettle over
them.
“I’ll b-blow it up,” Joe said, and taking
Sarah’s place, and making a bellows of his
hat, began fanning vigorously. Sarah flew
round, and. taking the cold meat from the
safe, started slicing it.
“We’ll fry some meat-fritters for them,
Mother,” she said cheerfully. “It won’t take
two minutes as soon as the fire burns up.
And there’s lots of cold potatoes and pump-
kin that we can heaten as well.”
But the fire, instead of burning up, was
burning down, notwithstanding Joe’s ener-
gies to sustain it. All that he could get out
of the wood now was smoke; and the chim-
ney being built at the wrong end of the
house, and the architecture of it being faulty,
the wind drove the smoke back. Joe became
engulfed in it.
“For goodness sake boy,” Mother coughed,
“come away and let it alone.”
Joe let it alone —-ran from it, with his hat
over his face.
Then Dad blundered in. He got a great
surprise. Instead of a steaming hot tea
greeting him, he could scarcely see anybody
or anything for smoke.
“W-what!” he yelled, trying to brush the
smoke away with liis two big hands.
The critical moment for Mother had
arrived. She lost no time in mildly explain-
ing where they had been and why they were
late home, and dwelt a lot on the good-
looking baby Mrs. Anderson had. When
Mother’s resources looked like becoming
exhausted, Sarah dexterously informed Dad
that Mr. Anderson was asking about him,
and wanted him to go over and see him
some Sunday, and that he had got such a
lot of ploughing done. “And when you go.
Dad,” she added, with great geniality and
affection. “I’m going with you, mind; don’t
forget that.” It's wonderful how skilled
women become in drawing herrings across a
Diid remained terribly silent, first glaring
at one, then at the other, and between
times hitting at the smoke; and by his
silence the others knew they were right on
the edge of a volcano. But Dad broke out
in an unexpected place.
“Can t y make a damn
fire burn better than that?”
he bellowed, striding to the
fireplace and disturbing the
sticks and rebuilding them.
“Have y’ been pullin’ the
fowlhouse down to make it
with ?”
Sarah explained that Joe
brought the palings in. Joe
denied that they had formed
part of the fowlhouse. “They
w-was lyin’ on the g-ground
u n del* w-where they
r-r-roost,” he said.
“It don't matter where
they was lyin’?” Dad
growled; then, lifting his
voice as lie finished adjusting
the sticks: “Haven’t y’ got
any kerosene or fat to make
it burn up with?”
Sarah found a supply of
dripping, and with it the fire
burst into a beautiful blaze,
and the smoke mostly dis-
appeared.
“Now we. -won't be long,"
Sarah said, encouragingly,
preparing the pan for the
fritters.
“H'm!” Dad grunted,
scowling at the table. “H’m!”
And he went outside and
came in again with a dry log
on his s™ulder, which he
placed behind the fire. Then,
like a -discontented elephant,
he lay down on the cold
.sofa and ruminated. While
lie ruminated the fire roared
and sent sent out a heat
that drove Joe under the
table. Soon the kettle
hummed a n d b o i 1 e d
over; the frying-pan
sissed and frizzled: the savory smell of
new-made tea, of cooked meat-fritters, of
fried pumpkin with pepper on it reached
his nostrils; he sat upright, and the big
frown that was on his face started to go
out of it.
“Now then, it’s all ready,” and Sarah, who
had been flying about like a pieman, dumped
the last hot dish on the table. “Come along,
father—l’m sure you must be tired wait-
ing,” and Mother took charge of the tea-
pot.
“There’s no hurry,” Dad drawled, taking
his place at the head of the table. “Plenty
of time.” And when he had served every-
one, and helped himself to a big supply of
meat fritters and pumpkin and potatoes, he
became talkative and jolly.
“What were it Anderson were askin’ about,
me gal V” he inquired of Sarah. And Sarah
mirthfully told it all over again, with diffi-
culty, and as near to it as she could remem-
ber. Sarah’s memory wasn’t always reliable.
Women’s memories never are after they have
pulled through a tight place.
Then Mother cheerfully related for Dad's
benefit how Sarah and she had run nearly
all the way home, in order to get supper
ready in time.
REALLY, IT WAS SECOND NATURE,

squeezes what he can out of girls and
then throws them aside.”
HIM: “Oh, but you shouldn't blame him for
that — he's a vegetarian, you know, and
is so used to eating fruit.”
“You needn’t have done tliet, Mother,"
Dad assured her. "It wouldn’t ha’ mattered
if y’ had stayed there all night. Joe and me
would ha’ managed.’’
“M-my oath we w-w-would”: and Joe
passed along his plate for more potatoes.
Then Dad. full and contented, leaned back
in his chair and sighed. “I wouldn’t like
to be one o’ them ol’ swagmen lyin’ out
under a tree to-night,’’ he said.
“No, n-nor me!” added Joe, stretching
himself out beside the fire.

Now, as I think back along the years, the
evening that supper was late is one of the
happiest memories that come to me of the
days on our selection.

Goodyear Balloon Ty
res
In Balloon Tyres,
as in others,
Goodyear means
Good Wear.
Balloon Tyres are fine—because
they practically eliminate jars
and jolts to you and your car.
Due to the fact that they are made
with thinner sidewalls to give
greater flexibility than tyres of an
earlier type, no ordinary cord
material can properly withstand
the continuous and repeated flex-
ing, and, at the same time, victori-
ously resist severe road shocks.
But in Goodyear Balloon Tyres
this problem of construction is
solved.
SUPERTWIST CORDS is the
answer.
This new cord material is finer,
more tightly woven and will
stretch further; and because of its
wonderful elasticity Goodyear
Balloon Tyres are made practical.
SUPERTWIST is found only in
Goodyear Balloon Tyres—either
to fit the new small-diameter
wheels or—without change—the
wheels now on most cars.
Make this Christmas and the
New Year, “Merry and Happy”—
ride more comfortably and safely
by equipping your car with Good-
year Balloon Tyres.
BALLOON TYRES


The Orchard-thief.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOUNG Eve awoke in Paradise, when all
the earth was new;
Across the shadows long and slim she
wandered in the dew
Until she saw a crowned snake about an
ashbole curled,
So early in the morning, the morning, the
morning,
So early in the morning, the morning of the
world.
She wondered when she heard him speak
(yet did not fear at all)
In such a voice as Adam's was, but far
more musical;
It sent a quiver down her spine, a sharp
thrill, sweet and keen,
So early in the morning, the morning, the
morning,
The stirring of the morning, when dawn was
gold and green.
lie spoke of strange, exciting things; he
turned her tawny head
To gaze upon the apple-tree that glowed with
gold and red;
The slirill, pure dawn-breeze blew to whet
Eve's hunger like a knife,
So early in the morning, the morning, the
morning,
So early in the morning she robbed the Tree
of Life.
At least the serpent said so, and what mat-
ter for the name?
The trees of Knowledge and of Life might
well have been the same
For all she cared, the orchard-thief, as reck-
less as you please,
So early in the morning, the morning, the
morning,
The cool impartial morning beneath the
Eden trees.
How, had it been the other, would the inci-
dent have closed?
And was the serpent’s opening lie as false as
he supposed?
Young Eve she was an orchard-tliief, we
know —and that is all —
So early in the morning, the morning, the
morning,
So early in the morning, the morning of the
Fall.
What else that new voice said to Eve all
womankind knows well,
But the fools misunderstand it and the wise
ones never tell.
Though Adam might be ruffled, and that baby
had no sense,
So early in the morning, the morning, the
morning,
She bit the fruit before him—and it makes a
difference.
SECOND NATURE.
“Poor old Robbo! He will miss his joy-rides. How did the
accident happen?”
“He’s so absent-minded, you know, and one day he crawled
wnder a mule to see why it didn’t go.”
Young Eve she Avas an orchard-thief: the
childish failing runs
Unaltered dowm the river of her daughters
and her sons.
No Puritan so honest that I’d trust him if
he came,
So early in the morning, the morning, the
morning,
The frosty autumn morning, to an apple-tree
aflame!

DOROTHERA MACKELLAR.
The Child.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE shadow that fell upon Olsted
seemed to blot out all his happiness.
So much of his life had become centred
in little Lorette that his new knoAvledge had
snapped every strand of its interests.
It was because of the child that he had
become a tame husband—a change from the
fickle Lothario which seemed even to him-
self almost unbelievable. Marriage he had
scarcely taken seriously. He had been
quite prepared, he told himself, to take it
seriously; but in those days he had ex-
pected his wife to be a warm-hearted com-
panion. He had been fool enough to fancy
she loved him; but the discovery that she
Avas a coldly-selfish Avoman, avlio Avas moved
by no stronger impulse to matrimony than
the desire of making a good match, altered
all that. The warmth of the passing pas-
sion had scarcely outlived the honeymoon;
and Olsted found himself with a curious
loneliness, a sense of something missed, and
a cynical bitterness Avhich made him regard
his matrimonial obligations as nothing that
need bar him from the pursuit of those
amorous encounters which had before given
him a racy reputation—that sort of reputa-
tion which is invariably exaggerated but has
a basis in fact.
Olsted Avas aAvare that his wife had some
sort of a feeling for him, but it seemed that
she merely desired to be dominant in his
life because that Avould be a tribute to her
personality. He found her nothing but
cold and exacting; and it was a sense of
respect due to the Avoman who Avas his Avife,
rather than from any belief that the know-
ledge of them Avould cause her heart-break,
that made him secret in his amours. Yet.
in spite of the fact that the flirtations of
Avhich she Avas aware were only harmless
affairs, lie felt her resentment beneath the
disregard she professed for them. Judging
it merely as the annoyance of one Avho ob-
jects to trespass upon her empery,
(listed at times experienced waves
of dark fury. There were moments
when he almost decided to make her
aAvare of his real infidelities, in
order to rouse her to some Avarmer
feeling : he refrained merely be-
cause he judged her incapable of
any Avarmer feeling.
The birth of the child had
altered his Avhole outlook. His
firm had some important commis-
sions in England, and he had been
selected to undertake them. It Avas
in quite an offhand way that he
had suggested that she could make
the trip Avith him if she chose.
"Of course AA-e shall be tied to
just England,” he said. “I’ll have
neither the time nor the money to
spare for making it much of'a plea-
sure jaunt. Still it Avill be a good
trip if you care about it.”
"I don’t know that it would be
much pleasure to me,” she said
with a laugh. “I’d be lonely aAvav
from all my friends. Perhaps you
had better go by yourself.”
Her indifference angered him so
that he could not slioav his dis-
appointment, or even admit it to
himself, hie * let it stay at that;
perhaps it was best from all points
of vieAV for him to go by himself.
Sometimes, before he left, she
appeared to develop a warmth, a
reluctance to let him go, that
almost prompted him to suggest
that, after all, she should travel with him.
The fear that she would refuse, after she
had shoAvn a rencAvcd indifference to vague,
tentative suggestions, restrained him. When
she had made his departure a sort of social
function, Avith a number of their friends pre-
venting that intimate farewell Avliicli he had
half hoped their parting would be, he decided
Avith an inward laugh—a laugh that Avas a
screen for his oAvn disappointment—that he
could have a much better time travelling by
himself than with an exacting wife at his
elboAv.
He had the good time, protracting his ab-
sence because of it. Her letters Averc too
cold and formal to make her a magnet to
draw him quickly back; lie developed the
habit of feeling that he Avas a single man as
long as he was aAvay from home, and enjoyed
the sensation of bachelor freedom.
Then her letter came
with the news. It was
in keeping with her
character that she
should have held it
back so long; yet he
found himself not
blaming her for cold-
ness, but extolling her
in his mind for modest
shyness. He found
himself also, after an
hour of confused,
ecstatic thought, in
which his mind ahvays
wandered back to the
intelligence he had re-
ceived, remembering an
appointment which
noAv he could not keep.
The woman’s voice at
the other end of the
’phone was nastily
angry when he rang
up to say so. He cut
her off suddenly, feel-
ing that even the
sound of her voice was
a sacrilege to the new-
found holiness that
had come into his
life. He found him-
self, tQo, hurriedly
finishing the last of
his business and taking the trip back to
Australia. The magnet that was wanted
to draw him back had been found at
last.
And now all the lapses he had known and
enjoyed since he left his home became mem-
ories which he would like to forget. He
had been carelessly indifferent —disgustingly
indifferent, it seemed now—to all moral re-
straint while.... His lapses had begun
early. He had got no further than Albury
before at breakfast he had met a girl whose
readiness to give him confidences had at-
tracted him. The confidences Averc con-
tinued in the observation-car as they con-
tinued the journey tOAvards Melbourne.
There he had a little business for his firm
before he caught his boat; his evenings were
disengaged, and the girl, who Avas going to
a city strange to her. eagerly accepted his
invitation to go to the theatre. She was
an amazingly simple girl; but, of course,
her moral sense was Aveak, or she would not
have so easily drifted into intimate friend-
ship with him, and so easily alloAved the inti-
mate friendship to, develop. Certainly he
had felt rather mean when he told her that
he was married, because she seemed then
to imagine that the episode Avas something
more than a brief incident that must come
to an end. The girl Avas a fool, but a warm,
human, passionate fool; and her attitude
had been less of anger than of dull hurt
that Avas in itself a reproach. He had been
momentarily tempted to ask'her to make the
journey with him: her warmth, compared
with his wife’s coldness, appealed to him.
But lie let the temptation pass.
Now there seemed something horrible
about what had been a pleasant memory.
Women had suddenly become more than the
mere creatures of man’s pleasure; and their
new role made his former regard of them
a desecration.
So Olsted came back to the cot of the
child, some weeks old AA'hen he returned, a
penitent to an altar; and as to the priestess
of that altar he gave his Avife reverence. In
her aloofness he found a beauty he had never
seen before: and although it to some extent
disappointed and puzzled him. he found toler-
ant reason for it. Home now, at any rate.
held something that made it all-sufficient to
him.
He hardly noticed at first the way in
Avhich his Avife’s dominance was falling upon
him; if he did notice it ; he saw no reason
to resent it. The child’ Avas five years old
before he woke up to a knoAvledge that some-
thing of the old bitterness had groAvn upon
him. He knoAV then again that she Avas as
cold, selfish and exacting as ever; that she
was only prompted by selfishness in all
NOT THE AGE OF MIRACLES.
“Shopwalker! I would like to see a one-piece bathing-
costume which would fit me.”
“Great Scot, madam —so would I!”
she did; that she gloried in her power to
rule him. Still, there was little Lorette,
and nothing else mattered. Though dissen-
sion arose between them, approaching to
what were at time almost brawls. Lorette
remained and stilled a tongue which hot
temper spurred to the expression of angry
thoughts. The child consoled him for all he
felt that he missed.
Then her resentment seemed to turn to-
wards the child. She was angry that he
should eagerly give it more attention than
he would bestow upon her.
It was in the hot anger of one of those
disputes that the blow came that darkened
all Oldsted’s life. A hundred times a cruel
thrust had been on his tongue; this evening
lie could not restrain it.
“Your absiml jealousy is directed even
against your own child,” he said. “And it
is not the legitimate jealousy of one who
feels love: it is just the auger of a selfish
woman who wants supremacy. Do you want
me to slacken the intensity of my interest in
Lorette —the only thing that ties me to you?
If it wasn’t for Lorette —our child—l would
be parted from you to-morrow!”
Then was Hell in her eyes as she looked
at him: a light that was almost red blazed
at him ; her lips were tightly pressed together
as she said, “Oh!” A torrent of fury seemed
about to pour from her; but she only
turned swiftly and left him. It burst a few
minutes later when she returned furiously.
■ “Our child!” she cried passionately. “You
said ‘our child.’ That is your mistake.”
Strange noises sang in Olsted's head. He
could see nothing for minutes but a white
face and blazing eyes that were like the pic-
ture of concentrated fury. The world seemed
breaking around him; the ground swaying
under his feet. It was after ages of chaotic
thinking that he was able to speak, and
then, all. he could say was: “What are you
saying? , Lorette is not”
“That’s what I said,” she retorted, her
eyes showing a flash of joy in his discom-
fiture.
He clutched a definite idea from the chaos
of his mind, and the fury of an outraged hus-
band swept him.
“Then you mean to tell me you”
There was ferocious meaning in the com-
mencement, but he checked the phrase.
“Yes,”, she taunted, her eyes still laughing
fiendishly at him. It seemed she delayed in
order to endure his torture; but as a hot
word formed on his tongue she interrupted
him savagely:
“Don’t you dare call me that! Lorette,
of course, isn’t my child either. I adopted
her.”
His knowledge of his wife’s character made
him believe her. Besides, her attitude and
voice carried conviction. Deprived of the
one definite, thought which he had been able
to grasp, his brain was numbed.
“You adopted her —why?” he said dazedly.
■“I thought it would hold you. I was
afraid of you staying so long away. I was
• afraid you might do something that would
force me to divorce you for my pride’s sake.
The child, I thought, would hold you to
me.”
He remembered many things that had pre-
viously had no significance: her absence from
her friends for a couple of months; the
change to a new neighborhood when she re-
turned from the country private hospital
where the child was supposed to have been
born ; the fact that he could not remember
any of her relatives who had been with her
at that time.
“You miserable trickster!” he cried. “You
wanted to hold me —-but not because of ar.v
love.”
“I may have had love —possibly,” she gibed.
"I certainly wanted your money—more than I
could get for alimony—and your position;
and there is no one else I want to marry.
I wanted to hold you; but” —her voice rose
in a burst of jealous passion—"I had no idea
in bringing a child into the house that it
would get the attention that rightfully be-
longs to your wife.”
Then a disbelief came to him; a hope
that what she said could not be true. Bin
she had proof to show him—proof which
included a birth certificate, for which he had
never thought to ask, with names that were
not his or hers set down as those of the
parents. When he tried to take them from
if r 11° them away in her bosom,
lie looked at her a moment as if prepared
to spring upon her and seize them ; but he
felt dull and heavy with his emotions, and
it did not seem worth while.
••Oh, you can keep them! he said. And
then his fury turned upon the child through
whose agency he had been duped. “I have
been cheated —made to love, as my own, a
nameless brat! You are right—you held me
-f- now the bond is gone and there is
nothing. t j ie d oor behind him seemed to
echo with a sound of finality—the sound
that breaks off the absorbed interest when a
book is closed, its story ended. Yet a tur-
bulence of emotion went with him, refusing
to be shaken off. He hurried to his club,
drank deeply and sat doivn to cards in the
hope that the play would make him forget.
But his play Avas abstracted and bad; and,
suddenly, as he sorted his cards without
realising what he was doing, he felt a couple
of little hands on his head and a childish
treble which cried “Daddy!”
“ What’s wrong with you, Olsted > asked
Bay ten. “You seem to have the jumps.”
"Oh, let’s throw the game in,” he said.
“I can’t concentrate to-night somehow. Come
on—l’ll pay.”
He went to bed so drugged with whisky
that he immediately fell to sleep; but—it
may have been in a couple of hours—he
woke to a painful wakefulness, with a heart
beating quickly. He could swear that a
childish voice had screamed in terror and
anguish—calling him, knowing that he had
gone. Imagination, of course; yet the im-
pulse was in him to rush out, through the
night, back to his home to see if the child
was safe, comfort it if it was distressed.
He tried to fight down the feeling, to
forget it, to deny its existence; but every
moment there came to him pictures of
the curly-licaded child, sounds of its voice:
now in endearment of him, now in terror and
grief. He loved the child! Even if it was
not iris own, lie loved it!
He tried to sleep, telling himself that he
would tear that love out of his heart; but
terrors assailed him. What would happen to
the child, innocent of all offence? Brutal
usage, perhaps, by a vindictive foster-mother.
A wild thought that in ungoverned anger she
might have thrust the child out to spend the
night in the streets ivould intrude itself.
The car —fortunately passing the door as
he left the hotel—seemed hardly to move.
Leaving it, he dashed to the door, let himself
in with his key and took the stairs three
at a time to Lorette’s bedroom.
An immense relief Hooded his heart as he
switched on the electric light: Lorette was
safe, sleeping peacefully. He observed, yet
scarcely noticed, that there was a figure
that drooped beside the little bed as if in
grief. But his wife, in that attitude, was
also asleep.
He went swiftly to the bed, dropped on
his knees beside it, and softly drew the little
curly head against his cheek. The child gave
a little, contented sigh as he did so, but did
not waken. And he was happy in being just
so; too happy to resent the presence of the
woman who was his wife and his enemy on
the other side of the bed.
She seemed to sense his presence, and
woke, raising her head to show a face tliat
was heavy with tears. She gazed at him
dully for a moment, and then spoke.
“it is Dot Dorain’s child,” she said, simply.
His heart seemed to empty itself, and
stand still. His mind went swiftly to Albury,
to Melbourne, to the simple girl he had met,
and the hectic nights afterwards.
“But the name on the birth certificate”—
“She took another name—it was my sug-
gestion in case there should be any search;
and, now she is married, it is better.

Coeurderoi.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THREE diggers dug in the Long Ago on
many a southern field,
And they spoke in terms old diggers
know, of “bottom” and “wash
and “yield,”
Of “color” and “prospect” and “panning-out, ’
of dish and cradle and tub.
Of the shallow “duffer” that “petered out,”
of “fossicking,” “wages” and “grub.”
But they knew no claim by a “Last Hope ’
name ; for ever they followed afar
The flag of the “Nil Desperandum” claim and
the “Eldorado” star!
•
And one was a Norse, and his eyes were blue
—he might have been Finn or Swede,
fW all three lands have the self-same look
that comes of the self-same breed.
And his hair was brown and his beard was
red, he had many a strange old song—
He was one of the Albert Williams’ crew
that stood by the Dandenong.
And ever in good luck or in bad, whatever
he sought to win,
His face was still and his eyes were sad as
the eyes of a Russian Finn.
And one was a German refugee from a
Prussian call to arms—
You’ll find them still with the greybeards
grey on the South Australian farms.
Because of his name for some blue-black
stuff, like pipeclay to the touch,
He was called Black Vitevasli amongst the
boys, and he lived and died as such.
Often he’d say to the younger mate, of the
Franco-Prussian War,
“You got a Rebublic, Gorderoy—vot ve vas
vighting vor.”
The German came from Bavaria, and the
Norseman came from the sea;
And the Frenchman he was a Cceurderoi,
and he came from Burgundy.
Hearts of kings had the Cceurderoi, and
they lived with a kingly zest—
Hearts of kings! They are beating yet
under many a peasant’s vest.
Hearts of kings! And they fought for kings
and republics and romance—
For a blind cause, for a lost cause —but they
always fought for France.
The years went by and the mates grew old,
who never had known despair;
They found some gold, and they built a hut,
and made a garden there.
For each one knew—though he spoke no
word—it was late to turn towards
“Home.”
So Peter dreamed of the Long Ago when
the seas were wide to roam;
The Frenchman dreamed of Alsace-Lorraine
and the French dream realised ;
And Herman dreamed of a Germany no
longer Prussianised.
Old Peter planted his kitchen stuff, as
stranded sailors will;
And Herman planted a Hamburg vine (it
grows on the old hut still).
They took it in turns to cook or dream or
fossick as days grew late;
And Alphonse planted some lily-bulbs by the
sapling picket-gate.
The busy bees at the pollen worked as they
had through all the past;
And the setting sun through those lilies
burned when I was that way last.
THE MONOPOLIST.
“ Darling, isn’t the scenery delightful ?”
“ Horace, love, surely you are not going to think of
scenery on our honeymoon?”
Then Alphonse sickened, and Peter sat and
watched him all night long
(He was one of the Albert Williams’ crew
that stood by the Dandenong) ;
And Herman tramped to the nearest town
—’twas a bitter night and black —
Through creek and scrub, by ridge and hill,
and he brought the doctor back.
But the dark day came when they took him
in, by cart and a longer track.
To lie in a ward with the Gulgong sick till
the great war-clouds grew black.
He heard the worst —and he heard the best,
when the fevered weeks were past:
How the German host had been driven back
and Paris was safe at last.
Grey Herman sat at the foot of the bed,
and Peter sat by the right;
And Herman lived in the bitter past—and
Alphonse died that night.
On his face was peace; and Herman sobbed,
when they told him all was o’er:
“You got a Rehublic, Gorderoy, vot ve vas
righting vor !”
HENRY LAWSON.
The Hazing of John
Cartland.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A COLD, foggy November morning. The
ship Happy Land, bound for Sydney, is
hauling out of the South-West India
Docks. Suddenly there is a scuffle on her
poop. A burly, red-whiskered man is strug-
gling with a brassbound apprentice. The
lad breaks away, and while the cork fenders
are grinding against the counter as she swings
around into the basin he springs over the
HE'D FURNISHED HIS QUOTA.
SISTER: “It's no use rushing away, Dickie. Mother says you are to come inside at
once and quieten little sister by telling her a story.”
DICKIE : “Not me. I’ve just tried it on Dad, and I can't sit down.”
taffrail on to the jetty. The red-whiskered
main roars out in one breath: “ ’Vast heaving
there for’ard! Hold on there aft! Hi, con-
stable, stop that lad!” A dock official darts
across the lad’s track, trips him, and sits
down heavily upon his chest until the mate
arrives with two of the hands and hustles
the would-be deserter aboard again.
This little incident, which occurred fifteen
years ago, was the opening scene of a sea
tragedy vividly recalled by a paragraph I
have just clipped from the shipping columns
of a Sydney daily. The paragraph reads
thus:—
Captain Roberts, of the barque Holland, which
arrived in the harbor yesterday, reports that, during
the voyage from London, the chief officer, Mr. John
Cartland, when superintending the stowing of the
lieadsails in a sudden squall, was knocked off the
fo’c's’le head by a blow from a pennant block. A
boat was quickly lowered, and pulled arornd for
two hours, but failed to And him. The ill-fated
officer was known to be an excellent swimmer, but
the blow on the head must have stunned him. He
was a single man, and a native of London.
I have another paragraph, cut from the
same paper the day after the Happy Land
arrived at Sydney on that voyage when Cart-
land tried to miss his passage and failed,
and I wonder if that pennant-block gave him
time to remember it. The thoughts of a
drowning man flit far
afield, and I know that, if
Cartland had a flash of
consciousness before the
sea choked him, his
thoughts flew back to the
“accident” which provided
the shipping reporter with
the following scrap of
copy:—
The outward voyage of the
Happy Land was marred by a
sad accident. It appears, from
the statement of an apprentice
who was at the wheel, that the
second mate, Mr. W. Hawkins,
was standing on the rail and
leaning outwaid to watch a
light that had been reported,
when a sudden lurch of the ves-
sel s< nt him overboard. An
alarm was at once raised, the
■ship hove to and a boat lowered,
but although it was a bright
moonlight night and a fairly
smooth sea, a long and careful
search revealed no trace of the
missing officer. Mr. Hawkins,
who was to have been married
upon his return to London, ,was
well known, and among his
friends in this port highly popu-
lar, and his sudden death cast a
gloom over the ship for the re-
mainder'of the voyage.
To a landsman there is
nothing to be read between
the lines of this brief story
of the sea that has re-
mained all these years in
my scrapbook, waiting for
the sequel which I have
just pasted in beside it.
Scarcely a week passes
without a similar occur-
rence obtaining a small space in the shipping
columns of the daily press. Sailors had a
trick of falling “over the fence” in the bad
old days. So had unpopular officers. Some
ancient shellbacks, when they find a highly-
colored account of a mutiny at sea, or a
mysterious disappearance of a ship’s officer,
in their evening paper, go so far as to say
that the trouble was probably caused by the
ill-treatment of the crew. So those who have
gone down to the sea in ships know that a
brief entry in the ship’s log of “lost over-
board” often covered an ugly story: maybe,
revenge for “hazing,” brutal indifference to
the loss of a “hand,” rotten gear. In any
case the version that appears is seldom the
truth.
The drowning of that “highly popular” offi-
cer Mr. Hawkins is a case in point. The
part of the story that did not appear in the
paper was known only to John Cartland and
myself. Now that he is dead the whole
story can do him no harm.
* * * *
On that gloomy November morning, fifteen
years ago, when I saw him struggling with
the second mate, they were both strangers to
me. I had served three out of my four years’
apprenticeship, and the Happy Land held no
attraction for me in the dock; so I had
brought my sea-chest aboard only a few
hours before the trouble commenced. It
was ample time, however, to discover that
the new second mate was a foul-mouthed
bully, and I had a presentiment that he
would make things unpleasant for the men
in his watch before we reached Sydney.
Cartland was evidently of the same opinion,
for he hadn’t been on board more than a
few hours when, catching sight of Hawkins,
he made his desperate attempt to get clear
of the ship.
Nothing of any note occurred until the tug-
boat had left us with a fair wind down the
Channel. The decks having been cleared up,
all hands were called aft to be divided into
watches. Cartland was then brought up
from below. The first mate ran his eyes
over the crowd of men with the critical gaze
of a recruiting sergeant, and then ordered
one of them to step over to the port side.
The second mate took the next pick, who
stepped to the starboard side; and so on,
turn about. When it came to us apprentices
I noticed Cartland straightened himself up
and looked eagerly at the chief mate, as if
to attract his favorable notice; but the mate
chose one of the first-voyagers. The second
mate looked pleased. “I’ll take the de-
serter,” he sneered; and the men laughed,
thinking it a capital joke.
Cartland stood 'still, with his eyes fixed
steadily upon the second mate.
“Now then, stir yourself!” bellowed the
second mate.
“I’ll answer to my name!” replied Cart-
land quietly.
The bully stepped towards him threaten-
ingly, then stopped, and, with an affected
drawl, said: “Will you kindly step over to
the starboard side, Mr. Cartland?”
There was another snigger from the crew
as Cartland crossed the deck and stood
slightly apart from the rest of his watch,
his brooding eyes still fixed steadily upon
his enemy. It was evident then to all hands
that there was some feud between the second
mate and the senior apprentice. For myself
I tried my best to catch the mate’s eye; but
he chose a lad who had been with him the
previous voyage. So I was doomed, with
Cartland, to work under the eye of that
“highly popular officer” Mr. Hawkins.
As soon as the mate left him in charge
of the deck, he gave us a sample of his
methods of acquiring popularity. I was on
top of the deck-house coiling down some
spare gear when I heard him shout: “Jump
aloft, Cartland, and loose the mizzen royal.”
I paused in my work to see how my new
messmate shaped, and certainly no fault
could be found with his smartness in going
aloft. He was soon at work upon that lofty
little rag, and as it fluttered down from the
yard it was quickly sheeted home. Then the
watch went to the halliards and stood wait-
ing for the order to “hoist away.” I was
not wanted, so remained watching Cartland.
It was growing dark, but I could see him
clearly enough. He was edging along the
footrope to the end of the lee yardarm, and
l heard him hail the deck. I didn’t catch
what lie said, but I guessed that the gasket
was adrift and he was claiming the atten-
tion of Hawkins, whose duty it was to see
him clear of the yard before hoisting it. I
saw Cartland holding on to the lift as he
reached out for the gasket, and at that
moment the yard was jerked upward. Haw-
kins had given the word to hoist it. As the
lift, relieved of the weight of the yard,
slackened up in his grasp, he fell, or threw
himself astride of the yardarm and clung on
for dear life as it swayed and jerked beneath
him.
I jumped from the deck-house and ran,
shouting, towards the poop. My yells were
at length heard above the roar of the wind
and the halliards’ chantey. The men stopped
hoisting, and. looking aloft, took in the posi-
tion at a glance. They glared at the second
mate, and the chantey-man. a burly Liver-
pool bucco, exclaimed: “Say, boys, what
sort of a murdering greaser have they
shipped on this hooker?”
Hawkins kept his gaze aloft and affected
not to hear the growling remarks of the
watch, but as soon as Cartland was off
the yard he turned and shouted : “What are
you staring it, you lazy hounds? Hoist
away there!”
The chantey-man swore, and drawled with
a Yankee twang:
Oh, there is that mate who stands on the poop,
and the watch responded with two drags and
a chorus of:
Away—ay, blow the man down.
The chantey-man shifted his grip on the hal-
liards and yelled:
If he hazes us, boys, we’ll give him the boot,
and the crowd behind him bent their backs
and pulled to a chorus of:
Give us a chance to knock the swine down.
This was a declaration of war. The old-
time wind-jamming shellbacks had a knack
of expressing their opinions of ships and their
officers to the tune of some favorite hauling
chantey, and Mr. Hawkins was obliged to
listen to some very frank opinions of him-
self before that yard was hoisted. When
the men came down the poop-ladder, they
hung about the main-deck instead of going
for’ard, evidently curious to hear what
Cartland would have to say. The second
mate noticed it, and, coming to the break
of the poop, shouted to them to go for'ard,
adding, with a string of oaths: “I’ll haze
you, my beauties; I’ll make you smell hell
before you get into soundings!” There was
a murmur among the little knot of men
standing in the shadow of the boat-skids,
and a voice retorted: “Come down here, you
blanky sojur, and make a start now!”
Hawkins snatched a belaying-pin from the
rail and jumped down to the main-deck, but
the men closed up so threateningly that he
ran back up the poop-ladder. The crowd
jeered at him, and the big Irish Yank
shouted: “You’ve shipped the wrong crowd
for your stomach this time, me bueco.
There’s no white-livered Dagoes in this watch
for you to step on !”
Just then Cartland swung himself out of
the rigging on to the poop, and, to my sur-
prise, passed the second mate without a word
and joined the watch on the main-deck. The
men clustered around him, explaining that
the second mate was solely to blame for the
narrow escape he had had from being jerked
off the yard. “And take my word for it,
sonny,” said the burly chanteyman, “he
won’t get another chance to play that game.”
Cartland appeared to take the affair
lightly. “He’s started early this trip,” he re-
marked carelessly; “but it’s not worth while
for you fellows to make a fuss about it.
You'll only get yourselves logged and do me
no good.” •
At this they commenced to ply him with
questions regarding his former experiences
with “the greaser,” but were at once inter-
rupted with a yell of “Weather main-brace!”
We were given no time to yarn during the
remainder of the'watch, for Hawkins kept
all hands busy trimming the yards and sweat-
ing up the sheets until the port watch
relieved us, and by that time he had estab-
lished his deputation as a “high stepper,”
judging by the forcible remarks of the men
as they went below.
I noticed that Hartland lingered about the
main-deck as though waiting for someone.
Presently Hawkins, who had been talking
to the chief mate, came off the poop, and
Cartland met him at the foot of the ladder.
I heard him ask Hawkins, in a quiet manner,
if he saw him on the yard when he ordered
the men to hoist it. “Of course I saw you,”
replied the bully. “The start you got will
teach you to be more careful with the gasket
next time you’re up there.” Then, raising
his fist in a threatening manner, he added:
“What have you got to say about it, any-
how?”
ON THE TRAIL.
LOVE-SICK LUIGI: “Ah, Beppo, I have found
out where da beautiful girl lives! She
lives in a house called da Tradesmen's
Entrance.”
“Nothing, sir,” implied Cartland calmly. “I
only wanted to be sure that you saw I was on
the yard," and he turned away and walked
into our deck-house.
Long after I was in my bunk he sat on his
sea-chest smoking, with his hands clasped
around his knees, staring thoughtfully at the
flame of the lamp. I couldn't sleep whilst
he sat there, so lay watching him, thinking
what a well-built, handsome seaman he
looked, and wondering what his previous ex-
perience of our new second mate had been
to cause such hatred between them.
At last I put my thoughts into words.
“Why has he such a set on you?” I asked.
Cartland started from his reverie and
looked up at me as I peered out at him from
the top bunk.
“Hullo!” he exclaimed. “I thought you
were asleep.” Knocking the ashes from his
pipe he put it on the shelf. Then he slowly
undressed, put out the light and turned in.
“It’s too long a yarn to tell you now, but
if we are good chums I'll give it to you some
day,” he said. “Good night.”
We turned out again at midnight and
mustered with the rest of the starboard watch
on the main-deck. When we had answered
to our names Hawkins gave the order: “Re-
lieve the wheel and look-out. Cartland and
Frazer, come up here.”
I followed Cartland on to the poop, and
the second mate at once commenced to give
what he called a fair warning. “Now. listen
to me, my lad,” he growled. “I guess your
last second mate was one of those lardi-dah
brassbound toffs from the Worcester with

kid gloves and an eyeglass, who talked to
the hands like a parson. Eh, wasn’t
he?”
“I don’t know that lie wore gloves and an
eyeglass,” I replied quietly; “but I do know
that he was a gentleman as well as a good
seaman.”
“Well, there's nothing of a gent, about
me,” exclaimed Hawkins, with an oath, “so
don't give me any cheek. Don't even look
cheeky or I'll make you wish you’d never
seen salt water. I’ll teach you sons of
gentlemen not to come to sea to take the
bread out of poor sailors’ mouths!” He
took a turn around the binnacle and con-
tinued : “You, Cartland, will pace the poop
and strike the bells. Frazer, you’ll stand
by the rail and keep a look-out, and there’ll
be trouble if I catch you nodding!”
It was a bitterly cold night, and soon a
rain squall came up with the rising wind.
The second mate got up from the seat on
the skylight and went below. I had my
oilskins with me, but Cartland had left his
in the deck-house, and very soon he slipped
down the ladder to get them. As he did so
the second mate popped out of the companion
and yelled to him to come back.
“Where are you skulkin’ off to?” he in-
quired.
“I was going to put on my oilskins.”
“Who gave you permission to leave the
poop?”
“Frazer was here. I’ve never had to ask
to be allowed to get my oilskins when two
of us were on the poop,” replied Cartland,
sullenly.
“Well, you’ll ask next time, me lad. In
•the meantime you’ll stay here without your
oilskins, and I’ll ask the mate to keep you
up an hour of your watch below,” growled
Hawkins as lie walked off to shelter under
the hood of the companion hatch.
As the rain grew heavier Cartland tried to
shelter from it under the lee of the spanker,
which was brailed up. But the second mate
drove him out, and made him stand in the
open.
It was such senseless persecutions as this
that made my blood boil. From the day
we left the Dock until the end came, the
second mate’s fiendish ingenuity was con-
stantly exercised in devising fresh schemes
to make my unhappy messmate’s life, still
more wretched. All the dirtiest and most
dangerous jobs were reserved for him, and
Hawkins took delight in humiliating and in-
sulting him before the crew whenever oppor-
tunity offered.
Cartland was soon suffering from lack of
sleep, as he rarely got his full time below.
One night he dozed on his feet from sheer
exhaustion as lie stood leaning against the
fife-rail. I saw Hawkins peer into his face
and then strike him in tine mouth. To my
surprise, as soon as Cartland stumbled to
his feet and realised what had happened, in-
stead of rushing at Hawkins, as I expected,
he steadied himself against the rail and
looked stupidly at the bully. IJis breath
came in short, panting sobs as he wiped the
blood from his lips.
“That’ll remind you not to go to sleep
on your watch, miss.” said Hawkins, whose
sneering voice roused the other like a whip
lash.
A CATCH EVEN IN THAT.
“I Relieve you spend most of your time in Harold’s car?”
“Yes. But the disappointing part about it is he spends most of
his time underneath.”
Advancing quickly Cartlaiul faced Haw-
kins, and, holding out his arms, said in a
hard, rasping voice: “It will be better for
you to put me b.elow in irons now.”
“No fear! You’d be a dam’ sight too com-
fortable as a passenger,” retorted the second
mate with a mocking laugh. “I know some
better tricks than that, as you’ll find out
before we drop anchor.”
“You’d better put me in irons! Better for
both of us if you put me in irons,” repeated
Cartland in the same monotonous, half-
threatening tones.
Hawkins stared at him a moment in sur-
prise. Then, striking away the outstretched
hands, he said: “You're mad, or you're gam-
monin’ to be. Here,
get hold of a hand-
spike and shoulder
it up and down
the poop like the
soldier you are.
That’ll keep you
awake.”
I had no chance
of speaking to him,
and he was still
pacing the poop
when I turned into
my bunk. Rut I
couldn’t sleep, and
when he came in
at two bells and
stood staring at
his swollen lips in
the mirror, I
startled him by
suddenly putting
the question that
was worrying me.
“Why did you
ask Hawkins to
put you in irons?”
“For safety,” he
answered in a
hoarse whisper.
“You saw him
strike me when I
was dozing—t li e
cowardly hound!
You’ve seen how he
has hazed me to
Hell all the trip!

and refused to put

raising his voice in

burst into tears.
* * * *
The full moon was two hours high when
I took my trick at the wheel. The ship was
close-hauled on the port tack, and under all
plain sail with a light breeze. I had relieved
a young Swede named Anderson, and when
he gave me the course, “Full an’ by der
wind,” and walked aft, I noticed that he
turned his head and stared at the second
mate, who was seated in his favorite corner,
with his head resting on the skylight. Where
he sat was in the deep shadow cast by
the after-canvas. Cartland, who had stopped
his patrol of the poop when I took the wheel,
was leaning against the rail, in the moon-
light, opposite the skylight. I whistled to
him softly, but he took no notice. IL>
was staring intently
at Hawkins. I was
watching him, and
wondering why the
second mate took no
notice of him. when
suddenly the bell on
the fo’c’s’le he a d
broke the stillness,
and the long, wailing
cry of the man on
the look-out floated
aft on the breeze:
“Light right ahead,
sir!” I looked to-
wards the skylight.
Hawkins had made
no move. Cartland,
however, was at the
binnacle in a few
strides, and, snatch-
ing the lamp, sprang
to the companion as
though he was going
to look at the clock
that hung inside at
the head of the lad-
der. In passing he
flashed the light on
Hawkins’s face.
“What are you do-
ing with that light?”
growled Hawkins, sit-
ting upright suddenly.
“Looking at the
time,” replied Cart-
land. “The look-out
for’ard has just re-
ported a light dead
ahead.”
“I heard him,” snarled Hawkins, getting
to his feet. “Let her go off a point, Ander-
son !”
“Aye, aye, sir! Let her go off a point,”
I repeated, as I put the wheel over. At
the sound of my voice he came to the wheel
and peered at me. “I relieved Anderson
half an hour ago,” I said, enjoying his dis-
comfiture at having betrayed himself.
The proof that Hawkins had been asleep
appeared to send Cartland mad with rage.
“Ah, you swine,” he growled. “You’ve kept
me up in my watch below and then hazed me
for sleeping on deck, but you'll do it no
more!”
ANYTHING TO OBLIGE.
“I’m hanged if I’m going swimming with you in that costume.”
“Well, where shall we go? Shopping?”
Hawkins aimed a blow at liis head, but
Cartland ducked and ran to the rail; then,
snatching a belayihg-pin, he jumped into
the mizzen rigging. Hawkins, with a blas-
phemous oath, sprang after him and gripped
him by the ankle. I saw his evil face up-
turned to the moonlight as he strove to drag
Cartland down. 1 saw Cartland stoop and
strike him on the head with the iron pin.
At a second blow Hawkins fell, without a
groan, into the sea.
Cartland jumped out of the rigging and
ran towards me with a wild glare in his eyes.
I thought he was going to run amok. “Steady,
you fool!” I said rapidly. “Rouse out the
watch. Say that he was hanging out on
the sheer-pole looking for the light ahead and
a lurch of the ship sent him over. I'll back
you up.”
He stared at me in a dazed way as if try-
ing to realise the position. Then a second
warning shout from the lookout roused him
into action. He sprang down the poop
ladder shouting: “Man overboard! All
hands on deck!”
I heard him barking out his orders in a
cool, efficient manner, and high above the
uproar of the wailing chanteys, and the
threshing of the sails as they were clewed
up, his voice could be heard urging the men
to put their backs into the job. No one
seemed more anxious than he to rescue the
second mate. By the time the mate popped
his head out of the companion Cartland had
us hove to with the lieadyards to the mast.
The Old Man followed and gave orders for a
boat to be lowered. As usual, there were
no davits shipped, no passengers being
aboard, so it took some time to get the stay-
sail and topgallant halliards on to one of the
boats that were lashed to the skids and swing
her oyer. But as soon as she was in the
water Cartland slid down the falls to un-
hook the blocks. I heard the Old Man. who
was watching him, say to the mate: “He’s a
smart lad that, let him stay there and take
charge of the boat.” It flashed upon me
that Cartland had anticipated that. He was
nearly out of his time, and quite competent
to take charge.
The mate and the Old Man stood at the
break of the poop, and in the silence, as the
men on the main-deck hung over the rail
watching the boat’s crew take their places,
I heard something roll near my feet. I
picked it up and looked at it by the light in
the binnacle. It was the belayiug-pin that
Cartland had dropped when he rushed off
the poop. I wiped it carefully, and, lashing
the wheel, crossed the deck swiftly and noise-
lessly on my bare feet and replaced it on
the rail. I got back to the wheel only just
iu time to see the mate coming aft.
“Did you see the accident?” he asked.
“Yes, sir,” I replied; “I saw him fall.”
“Then come down to the saloon as soon
as you are relieved,” he said; “the captain
will want to hear your evidence for the log-
b°lkfelt glad I had told Cartland what to
say; for, although I had little fear of the
truth being discovered, I knew that the ill-
feeling between him and the second mate was
known by the crew, and that suspicion would
soon be aroused if we differed much in our
statements. , _
We tacked about for two hours, burning
flares occasionally to give the boat’s crew
our position and edging' down towards her
when our signals were answered. Then the
Old Man signalled her to return. As she
came alongside I was half-afraid that
l might see something in her lying along
the thwarts: but there was nothing, save
Cartland and his wearied crew. When the
boat had been hoisted, and we bore away on
our course again, I had time to whisper to
Cartland what I had signed in the log-book
before lie went below to report to the Old
Man. Then I turned in.
Cartland looked very pale and worn-out
when he came in. For some time he sat on
his sea-chest, his eyes fixed upon the lamp
with a vacant stare. His lips were twitch-
ing nervously with the reaction after the
excitement he had borne since he struck
Hawkins down. He must have been under
a tremendous strain to maintain his com-
posure when making his report to the Old
Man ; but now the mask was dropped, and
I saw the horror of the night written upon
his face, so fixed and still but for the rest-
less mouth.
At last he put out the light; then “Are
you awake?” lie said, and, leaning over the
edge of my bunk, continued in a whisper:
“/ saw him out there. God, I shall always
see him! He was moving his arms slowly.
But he couldn’t have been alive. He couldn’t
—could he?”
“No,” I said. “It was merely the action
of the waves.”
He was silent a moment as though he
hesitated to say any more. Then he con-
tinued : “It was a miracle the men didn’t
see what I saw; but I drew their attention
in another direction and altered our course.
If I hadn't been in charge of the boat”-
he stopped abruptly and shivered. “But I
don’t regret it,” he added, with a touch of
defiance in his tone. “It was his life or
mine. He would have done me in sooner or
later. You saw him try it that night lie
nearly threw me off the mizzen-royal yard.”
“But why?” I inquired. “You have never
told me.”
“He was my step-father, and he killed
my mother with his cruelty as surely as
though he had knifed her. I have always
hated him for it, and he hated me because
I stood in the way of his getting the money
she left.”
I remained silent.
“Do you blame me?” he asked, after a
pause.
No,. I couldn’t. Knowing all he had suf-
fered, I felt that I might have done the
same under the same provocation.
He was silent a moment; then he spoke
again. “The Old Man has appointed me
acting-second, so this is the last time we will,
berth together. You’ve been a good pal, and
I know you’ll remain one.”
Ilis hand groped along the edge of my
bunk, and I grasped it for the first and
last time.
* * * *
We rarely spoke during the remainder of
the voyage, and soon after we arrived in
Sydney I slipped away quietly one night
and was well into the bush before the Happy
WHAT A MAN CAN DO WHEN
HE'S LUCKY.
BEST MAN (at returned soldier's wedding) :
“Cheer up, Digger. Don't forget we
came through Lone Pine all right.”
Land was washing down decks the follow-
ing morning. I had no liking for working
under the orders of my old messmate. Be-
sides, Australia looked good to me; and
although the call of the sea lured me back
several times, I was never again shipmates
with John Cartland.

To-morrow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
44 T~N ’JER set yer missus’s letter, Bill?”
) Bill tilted liis glass and hitched
up the string round his waist.
“Yairs. I got it all right, Jack. It'll be
from young Alf, I expect.”
“Down in Sydney?”
Bill nodded, his wistful, weather-beaten
eyes glancing round the bar. It was plea-
sant in here in the cool; through the door-
way he could see the white glare of the
road, and Jenny’s tail swishing madly at the
flies. Four niiles of it, and not a patch of
shade. He blew out his thin cheeks, glanced
at his glass again, and pushed it over the
counter.
“One more, Jack?”
“I don’t mind.”
At the door Bill hitched up his string
belt again, and climbed up into the sulky.
“Y’ ’aven’t spliced yer shaft yet,” Jack
said dreamily from the twilight of the ver-
andah, his sleepy eyes watching a patch of
hessian and some cord in the middle of the
off-shaft.
“No. No time to get at it yet. I’ll be
fixin’ it up to-morrow, I expect. S’long,
Jack.”
The flies screamed with rage at the cloud
of dust that Jenny raised, and Jack turned-
back to the bar. Grogan was wiping glasses
listlessly.
“This heat’s pretty solid, Jack,” he said.
“’Ow’s old Bill?”
“ ’E’s all right. Goin’ to splice ’is shaft
to-morrer.”
Andy looked up from his paper at the far
end of the bar and laughed; Grogan put
down a glass and laughed ; and .Tack pushed
a shilling over the counter and laughed.
“Poor old Bill!” Grogan wiped his fore-
head with the glass-towel. “Young Alf knew
a bit when he nicked off to Sydney out o’
that lot.”
The sun glared angrily at Bill as Jenny
dragged him the four miles, and tried to give
him a fatal sunstroke as he reached the
gate and climbed down to open it. This
opening was rather a long job; 10,000,000
new flies had found Jenny’s most easily
irritated points and settled there before BilF
got the home-made rope-fastener unshipped
and the gate to swing' clear. The original
fastener was still there, but the gate had
sagged, and the catch on the post was out
of the fastener’s reach. Twenty minutes
with a jack and a screw-driver would have
put it right; but for seven years Bill hadn’t
seemed to get round to that 20 minutes. After
he had spent the necessary four or five in
the delicate operation of opening it and clos-
ing it, he looked wistfully at the contrivance,
deciding that he really must get at it to-
morrow.
On the back verandah lje found Milly, her
arms up to the shoulder in a tub of clothes
and soapsuds.
“Well, Mill,” he said.
“Well, Dad,” she answered without look-
ing up.
“Where’s mum?”
“In the lean-to, moppin’ up the floor. You
said you was goin’ to fix the tubs to-day.”
Milly was entirely recitative, without color
or bias or any atmosphere at all.
“Yairs,” Bill said equally tonelessly. “I
got a letter for ’er.”
He crossed the verandah and went into
the kitchen, dodging Milly’s flying soapsuds
and half afraid of the energy expressed by
her plunging back and shoulders.
“Red and Mart was over, dinner-time,” she
said as he passed. “About the twenty-acre.”
“What about it?”
“I dunno. Mum saw ’em.”
Mum looked up from her knees as he ap-
peared at the doorway of the lean-to.
“This is a nice thing, Dad,” she said.
“Every Monday for six months I’ve flopped
down on me knees! When are yer goin’ to
fix them tubs?”
“Oh, some time to-morrer I’ll get at ’em,
I expect. I got a letter for yer.”
Mrs. Ilemmings sat back on her heels.
“Not from Alf?”
“I expect it’ll be from ’im. What’s this
about Mart and the twenty-acre?”
But Mum was deep in her letter. “’E
can’t send anything,” she muttered. “I never
thought ’e could, not with ’imself to keep
an’ all, and in a place like Sydney. ’E’s a
good boy, Alfy; but what can yer do on
two-ten ?”
The outer doorway darkened, and Laura
came in, dumped a kerosene-tin on the floor,
took two clothes-pegs out of her mouth and
grinned at her father.
“What’s this about Mart and the twenty-
acre?” he asked.
Laura grinned again and pointed to Mum.
Laura always was a bit tongue-tied. “Ask
’er.” she conceded.
But Mum’s apathy had been shaken by
something in Alf’s letter. You couldn’t ask
her anything yet.
“What’s this ’£ says—‘l can't send any
cash. I’m broke. But all of us went in for
the Lifeboats Art Union, and I won the
second prize. The other fellows didn’t win
anything. I’ve packed it up and am sending
it with this. It’s more in your line than
mine, and I thought you'd like it. As a
surprise. It's up to you to have something
pretty for once. So I took it instead of the
cash’ ”
Mum paused and looked uncertainly from
Laura to Bill. Neither face bore the least
BUT IT WASN’T.
BRONSON : “You look worried. What’s the trouble?"
BROWN : "I made a sad domestic mistake last night."
BRONSON: “How?"
BROWN: “My wife invited one of her old flames to a party, and
I thought that was sufficient precedent for me to ask an
old sweethcart to our next.”
sign of life; and she turned back to the
letter.
“Well, that’s all ’e says,” she told them
after a moment. “Did yer bring the parcel?”
“There wasn’t any parcel. It’ll come to-
morrer, I expect.”
“Yes, I s’pose it will. I wonder”
She got to her feet and glanced at Laura.
“Give the floor a dry wipe-over, will yer,
Laury?” she said. And to Bill; “Mart was
over. I wanter talk to ycr. ’E’s cornin’ over
again next week.”
“Righto. What’s ’e want?”
Mum shut the door of the room and turned
to Bill. “’E wants the twenty-acre—’im an’
Red. Are yer goin’ to let ’im ’ave it?”
“Well”—Bill looked at his boots and wist-
fully up at Mum. “We’re pretty near broke.
I teas goin’ to start a bit o’ clearin’ there to-
morrer or next day. But”
Mum sat down emphatically. “It’s the
only patch on the place that’s worth workin’,
as I’ve bin tellin’ yer for ten years.” She
leaned across the rickctty table and looked
into Bill’s worn face. “If yell let it go yer
can walk out in six months as broke as when
you was born, Dad, let alone what you are
now.”
She watched Bill twirling his battered hat
and hitched her backless chair nearer to the
table.
“Look. Dad,” she said quietly. “This is
’ome, ain’t it. for you an’ me? It’s been a
rough spin, what with the droughts an’ one
thing an’ another, an’ we’re pretty near the
finish. I know ’ow ye’re feelin’—’ow yer bin
feelin’ a few years now—an’ I know what a
bit o’ money ’d make ycr feel like to-day.
But if yer get it by partin’ with the twenty-
acre you’ve sold yerself up. I was never one
to drive ycr, as yer know—p’r’aps Alf’d be
still at ’ome an’ we’d be a bit more comfort-
able if I ’ad ’ave bin —but you think about
it.”
She stood up and looked thoughtfully at
the top of Bill’s grey head, Alf’s letter still
clutched in her shapeless brown hand.
“This is ’ome,” she repeated; “an’ we’re
not young ’uns. Two seasons with the
twenty-acre workin’ an’ we might be right.
Can’t yer” but she walked to the door
without finishing the sentence. At the door
she turned and, still grave, said; “You think
about it all round, before yer let yerself in,
Dad.”
Bill sat where he was for a moment or
two after she’d gone. Money in hand! Sub-
consciously his eyes went round the room—
the backless chair, the butter-box he was sit-
ting on, the bush-table that had been “tem-
porary” ten years ago, the Christmas supple-
ments pinned unframed on the uprights and
rails. There was Alf cleared off; Mum
worn out; and Mill and Laury. A bit o’
money! If he went over to Mart’s to-
morrow or the day after Sighing he
put on the battered hat and went out.
Baked and parched land, red and yellow;
broken fences, where there were any; occa-
sional patches of haggard scrub or saplings,
or one tall motionless tree. Nearer, a stable-
door hanging drunkenly on one hinge; a cow-
bail with a floor of filth and the drone of a
myriad blowflies; a litter of packing-cases,
hroken iron, timber, and unsplit logs of fire-
wood. And heat, solid and windless, impos-
ing sullenly upon the desolation.
The lilac distance which seemed alive with
dust and heat was broken half-way to the
horizon by a stretch of heavy growth, rank
and tropical in the surrounding bare nothing-
ness. This was
the twenty-acre.
Here Nature
rioted, happily ex-
hausting herself.
Over all the twenty
acres the massed
richness of scrub
and undergrowth
extended, rising'
here and there ia
thick clumps of
trees. A matted,
luscious growth—a
sort of flaunting
banner of what
could be done.
But the clearing
—for years Bill
had looked at the
twenty-acre and
thought of the
clearing. One man
couldn’t do it, not
in a month of Sun-
days; he’d no
chance of getting
at it, with this and
that to do to-day
and to-morrow and
the day after.
What would be
Mart’s idea of
price? He sup-
posed he’d want
terms. Bill blew
out his cheeks and
pulled his hat over
his eyes. It was
worth something,,
the twenty-acre.
8ut.... better have a look round it to-mor-
row, and think about it, like Mum said.
But to-morrow he was sent to the township
with instructions to arrive there at mail-
time, and to come straight back. These in-
structions he followed, and brought with him
an oblong box very carefully addressed to-
Mrs. Hemmings in Alf’s clerkly writing. In
the room this was opened, and from wrap-
pings of shavings and crinkly paper its con-
tents taken. After her first gasp of amaze-
ment Mum said nothing. With infinite care
she took each item out of the box, unwrapped
it and put in on the table, impatiently wav-
ing away Milly’s and Laura’s efforts to help.
She put back the shavings and paper and
handed the box to Bill, still in silence, who
took it out into the yard.
-On the bush-table there remained a dress-
ing-table set in tortoiseshell and silver. A
tray, two brushes and a cpmb, a liand-mirror,
and three little pots; all solid tortoiseshell
or backed with tortoiseshell, and all mar-
gined with a narrow, dainty ribbon of silver.
Mum touched these now and then with a
tentative forefinger, the expression of her
face not changing. To the outcries of Mill
and Laury she paid no attention, nor to
Bill’s murmured, inarticulate admiration.
Her eyes were shadowed as she looked down
at the exquisite things, and she said nothing;
so Bill couldn’t tell what she thought of
them.
Presently she laughed, and took the things
one by one into the bedroom, and put them
on her dressing-table, hiding away the wooden
brush and xylonite comb they replaced. Their
effect on the dusty and dingy petticoat of
the packing-case table was not entinely satis-
factory. but they themselves were beautiful
—a fair treat to look at.
After dinner Bill “had a look rounci” The
tortoiseshell set crept in and out of liis mind.
A CASE OF TRUE LOVE.
“You wouldn't marry me just for bones,
would you, dear?"
“No, dear—not for all the bones in the
world”
You’d hardly believe such bonzer things were
made—and Mum with one all on her own.
Probably Mart could put down a lair de-
posit. And the bosker little silver edges, as
if the tortoiseshell wasn’t enough. A haze
■came up in the west and with it a stealthy
wind; one might think it promised rain, but
it didn’t—only dust, in a storm. Too risky
to try for the twenty-acre now; better leave
it till to-morrow. But half-way home the
stealthy wind shifted and the sky cleared,
when it was too late.
At the sound of his boot on the verandah
Mum called him, from the bedroom. 1 lie
place looked fresher, somehow, to Bill. There
was a clean white petticoat on the dressmg-
> table, all starched and frilly, for one thing;
and there were window-curtains up, for an-
other. The brass knobs of the bed had been
polished, too. It looked real nice—its nice-
ness centering, as you might say, in the tor-
toiseshells on the table.
“Why, Mum,” Bill started; but she inter-
rupted. , . ,
“Now look, Dad,” she said, a half-smile
behind her truculent eyes, “ycr see that paper
strippiiT off the hessian —there; and there;
and there?”
Bill looked at the strips hanging raggedly
from the hessian lining. It did look a bit
<..-er the odds now.
"Yairs,” he said patiently.
"Well, you got some lining-boards out in
the yard, ain’t yer? Now you sort them out
an’ do up this room for me, see? An’ set
to work at it to-morrow mornin’ early.
I’m not goin’ to ’ave Alfy’s jewellery stuck
in any old place.”
“Righto! It would look good with limn
boards and a coat of paint.”
“’Ow d’yer like me dressin’-table?”
“It’s bosker, Mum. I dunno as I ever
,see”
“Oh, you ain’t seen so much!” she laughed
at him. “Now go an’ look out them boards
while there’s light.”
In the yard Laury passed him, carrying
water to the fowlrun. Laury was singing—
singing! Bill looked up and she stopped the
song.
“Seen Mum’s dressin’-table?” she asked.
“Yes. Goodo, ain’t it?”
“I sh’d think it was.” And the song began
again.
He went on with the boards, and finally
got them all out of the heap. There might be
enough with some jiggery-pokery behind the
bed. He’d see to-morrow.
There was just enough, without any jig-
gery-pokery. He stripped all the hessian and
paper off, sent Mill to the township for nails,
and was painting by mid-day of the follow-
ing day.
Mill was concerned about the gate. “If yer
goin’ to do a few things about the place.
Dad,” she said, “there’s the gate. I could
jack it up for yer with a sapling while yer
fix it. Take us a quarter of an hour.”
“Can't yer see I’m workin’? I’ll fix the
gate to-morrer.”
But Mum came and showed him his paint-
smeared face in her new tortoise-shell mir-
ror ; and, after a few minutes’ painting
when she’d gone, he got off the soapbox and
went to find Mill and the screwdriver. And
in silence the gate was fixed at last.
When the bedroom was dry it looked fine
—set off the tortoise-shells a treat. Bill
stood back and admired it while Mum brought
in the treasures it was made for. Yet he
wasn’t quite satisfied.
“Them supplements,” he said. “There’s
some lengths of inch-strips. I c’d saw ’em
off an’ nail a bit of a frame round —give yer
some pictures, like.”
So the housing of the jewellery was
finished.
Stacking up the timber again, Bill found
some rails he’d forgotten ; he thought of the
fence beyond the cow-bails. Mum saw him
over there from the lean-to window, and
laughed.
Every now and then during the day he
slipped into _ the bedroom and had a look
at the tortoise-shells and the room around
them. His expressed opinion was that it
was not too bad; and Laury and Mill
laughed at him for a skiter.
On the Friday he went into the town-
ship, and came back late in the afternoon
riding the astonished Jenny.
“Where’s the sulky?” Mum asked him in
consternation.
“Rawlins is fixin’ the shaft. ’E says it
wants a new one, but ’e’ll do it cheap an’
no hurry ajbout payin’. Mum”
She looked up at a new note in his voice.
“Well, Dad?”
“If Metrt comes over about the twenty-
acre tell *im it’s off, will yer?”
A light flashed into her eyes.

“The Kelvinator which you recently installed at
my private residence is giving complete satisfaction in
service. The outstanding feature of the installation
is its entirely automatic operation.”—J.M.
Mona Vale.
“In a place like this where it is difficult to get ice
and where meat, etc., deteriorates rapidly in summer, the Kelvinator
has proved a great boon.
My satisfaction with the plant is the greater because I ran it
with current derived from a small 32 volt, 36 light plant.”—H.L.
Melbourne.
Has exceeded our greatest expectations and supplied our every
want—providing us with more ice than we could possibly use, and
above all, keeping our perishable food in tip-top order.”—G.R.N.
Melbourne.
I am very pleased with the Kelvinator which you supplied me
with early in the year at my private house.”-—C.B.K.

“I have had the Kelvinator for several weeks and I am pleased
to inform you that I have the greatest satisfaction from it.”—J.F.

Dreaming Roads.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A HUNTING owl in noiseless flight
Flits black across the moon ;
’Tis midnight and in silver light
The bloodwoods seem to swoon.
A curlew in the distance cries,
(Ties thrice, and sinks to rest;
Fast-locked in sleep the landscape lies,
A river on its breast.
A low wind, sighing, stirs the leaves
Of gum and pine and oak;
A campfire by a hillside weaves
A veil of tinted smoke.
From hill to plain, from plain to hill,
From town to quiet town.
All dustless, sinuous and still.
The roads go up and down.
By timbered bluff and river-bend,
By orchards, fields of maize.
Beneath dark, brooding trees they wend
Upon their many ways.
Bike roads across a land of dream,
Each weird and silent shows;
Along their miles beside.his team
No trudging teamster goes.
Man sleeping sound, life pulsing slow.
They dream and nothing feel —
Nor plodding foot nor hoof they know,
Nor grinding waggon-wheel.
With here a moonlit barn in sight,
Vnd there a farmhouse roof.
They dreaming journey through the night
Unstirred by foot or hoof.
The hour a web of sil nice weaves,
And mute is everything:
A wind alone, that stirs the leaves
And grass, is wandering.
I ike men who slumber sound and deep,
• Forgetful of life’s loads.
The busy roads have gone to sleep,
And now are dreaming roads.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BABETTE and I have quarrelled!
At least Babette lias. It wasn’t a
mere tiff. Both Babette and I are
much too sensible to have tiffs now: this
was a Row. And, really, it wasn’t anybody’s
fault, though, personally, I blame Maud. At
least, somebody had christened her Maud,
but everybody, apparently, shied at the
name, and one idle hour she ticked off for
me the pet names that all her other male
friends—she had a full hand- —-used to call
her. But, looking up at me with that soul-
ful gaze—though the dear thing hadn’t a
soul at all —she confessed that she liked my
pet name best.
Maud and I were, however, properly intro-
duced, though it was by somebody unknown
to either of us. An engineer, I imagine, on
a ferryboat. And even he never knew that
he had introduced us.
I was returning to an unsuspicious
Babette from an auction-bridge evening, and
just managed to catch the midnight boat.
I was in the smoking compartment, and
looked up to see, sitting opposite to me, but
entirely unconscious of my presence, a
thrilling figure of a girl in evening dress.
She had been, I supposed, to some jazz
party, and was returning home alone. As
our eyes met, she hastily averted hers.
Modest young thing, but so utterly desirable!
Being, I hope, a gentleman, I avoided looking
at her, except when she was not looking at
me. It was a most painful predicament;
for the girl’s face and figure were worth
the closest scrutiny.
Though the night was cold, she evidently
found the smoking compartment stuffy; for
she threw back her cloak and revealed a
neck and a chest that were well worth dwell-
ing upon. (I speak figuratively.) Anxi-
ously I looked around to find a shut window
that I could unobtrusively open to give her
the air she needed; but, of course, all the
windows were wide open.
Then she took out her vanity-box and
conscientiously regarded her features in her
little mirror. I almost called out to her to
leave her face alone. She might spoil it.
and she certainly couldn’t improve it. But
I was wrong. With an art that appealed to
me. she kissed her red lips with a lipsol
stick, caressed a tiny curl that demurely
hid her left ear, and maddeningly fondled her
chin with a chamois.
She was obviously not tile sort of girl
that a stranger could speak to without pro-
vocation. I dared not ask her where I had
met her before and where I could meet her
again. Oh. it was hopeless!
Then came the catastrophe. Into the
saloon sacred to our two selves came a
middle-aged man and his time-battered wife.
Nothing now could help us but a miracle.
For a mad moment I thought of the possi-
bility of the electric light failing: but I
knew that miracles do not happen by Coue-
ism. In the remote contingency of such an
accident there were, however, entrancing
possibilities in the darkness.
And then, without the slightest warning,
the impossible happened. The electric lights
went out all over the ferryboat. The
saloon was in utter darkness!
With a chivalric instinct I put out my
arms to reassure her. I had not to put
them out far. In her surprise at the sud-
den darkness she had jumped to her feet.
We met half-way. Into my arms she slid ;
her face looked up. and I felt on my lips
a soft warm lipsol contact. What should a
gentleman do? Her bare arms clung about
my neck for support, though that was not
really needed, since I was gripping her close.
How long that embrace, soft and luxurious,
lasted, I could not tell; but I know that
not for one instant did I remember that I
was married. When, to get a better pur :
chase —the thing in my arms was all delicious
softness—l loosened by lips from hers, I
had a moment of commonsense. We would
get no warning when the current returned.
There was a tiny flicker within the bulbs,
and hurriedly we regained our seats,
breathing hard. Not a moment too soon.
The lights glared again ; but there we both
were, calmly sitting opposite each other, as
remote as the poles. There was not even a
blush on her face, though that may have
been due to the surface powder. But there
was something wrong: we were sitting
aloofly opposite each other; but we had, in
the encounter, changed seats! Maud gave a
gasp, but that was all. And to this' day I
feel sure that the exemplary couple who
were gazing at us are not quite certain
whether they could believe, their eyes.
I saw her home. At the garden gate she
told me her name and a lot of lies. I did
my best, too. But when she mournfully
sighed, looking up from my arms with those
pathetic eyes of hers, “Of course you are
married? You’ve got that married look.
All the nice men are always painfully mar-
ried !” I surprised her by telling her the
truth. I freely admitted it.
“I'm so glad!” she whispered. “I like
them married best. A married man is so
safe, isn’t lie? But, really, that was not a
married kiss you gave me in the dark. Nor
this one, either!”
Tt was only when I reached my flat—
luckily it was all in darkness —that I remem-
bered I was married to Babette. It was a
terrible discovery for a husband to make.
What a brute I had been!
Next morning I awakened with a firm re-
sob e to forget all about Maud, though there
were parts of her —her shoulders and her lips
—that were most intrusive. Here was I, a
happily-married man, with the most attrac-
tive wife in all my experience: and I was
deliberately risking her and my happiness, to
say nothing of the innocent children, by an
unnecessary clandestine affair with a delect-
able but doubtless silly girl.
I had promised to ring Maud up from the
office. My better instincts triumphed. I
refrained. Maud's telephone number was
not one that I could possibly forget; it was
printed too deeply upon my lips. But duty
restrained me. If only wives would credit
their husbands with the powers of self-
restraint husbands invariably possess, in the
face of the many temptations that assail
them !
When I heard that soft and timorous
voice through the telephone, asking if it
really was me, I melted. At all costs I must
see her again. Well, what could I do?
What would any devoted husband do? I
did.
She was aimlessly waiting for me that
afternoon at the picture-show. There is
too much light in this civilisation of ours.
The pupils of our eyes are dazzled and ex-
hausted by the glare of light that afflicts
us, day and night. To sit watching the
flickering of pictures upon a screen is, cer-
tainly, somewhat tiring to the delicate organ-
ism of the human eye; but there is no
need to watch the pictures if you are seated
cosily on the back seat of a picture show—
to which Maud unerringly led me.
For a fleeting moment I caught sight of
the screen. By sheer luck the hero
of the film-play had at that moment
clasped the heroine in a firm film clutch.
Instinctively I followed his excellent
example. The girl on the screen snuggled
herself into his arms. Somebody snuggled
into my arms. Evidently Maud had been
sitting up and taking notice. The film hero-
ine indulged in that sensuous, squirmy
wriggle that had made her famous. Judg-
ing by Maud’s imitation, the film queen
earned her money easily. Then the pas-
sionate embrace on the screen was dupli-
cated, and in several particulars improved
upon, by two obscure citizens in the back
scats that were not paid for it, nor wanted
to be paid for it. It was, itself, its own
reward.
“And now,” she said, “when am I going
to see you again?”
I vaguely suggested another picture-show.
Maud demurred. “Yes, man, it’s been
lovely. I never really enjoy pictures by my-
self. But wouldn't you just love to take
me out to dinner —I know lots of places
with alcoves —and then jazz, and home in
a taxi?”
“I would just love, but”
It had never occurred to me before how
difficult it is to take a strange female out
for the night when a husband has lost that
habit. Babette and I are such an ideal
couple that she always knows where I am
at any part of the day or night, and nearly
always I know where she is. Of course, when
I'm away from town... .Babette is a sport.
Whenever I am going on a holiday she bids
me farewell with the strict injunction that
if anything comes my way I should grab
it. Her life, she says, is so dull that the
recital of my adventures would assuredly
cheer her up. She insists on that. And
when I come home with an account of my
rather innocuous adventures (though, for
her sake, I make them as exciting as I
can), she mysteriously smiles: “I, too, have
not been idle.”
When, however, we two are living the
strict connubial life, there are few opportuni-
ties. and little inclination, for outside affairs.
Babette makes up for much that I would
otherwise miss. So, when Maud, made her
pathetic plea, I wondered miserably how I
was going to “get away with it” without
Babette’s suspicions. Not that Babette is
suspicious. The trust she has in men to
whom she has just been introduced is almost
child-like.
“Surely there are some nights,” suggested
Maud, “when you have to work back in the
office? Haven’t you got a cable that must
be answered that night? Couldn’t you be
detained waiting for an important telephone
message until it is too late to come home
to dinner ? Haven’t you got a married sister
who wants to consult you urgently on a
matter of business? What aboui? being de-
tained all night on a jury? Isn't there a
mythical bridge four that would keep you
out till after midnight finishing a rubber?
Didn’t you take one spot too many and have
to go to your pal’s place to sleep it off?
Couldn’t you be arrested for something that
would mean a night in the cells? Isn’t there
a lift: in your office that will jamb and keep
you hours between two floors before you
can get out? Mightn't you have to take a
pal home, and find him so bad that you had
to stay at his bedside, mopping his fevered
brow all night? Couldn’t you get a sub-
stitute for yourself at your regular weekly
bridge game? Surely it is easy to lose your
memory and spend the whole night wandering
about, asking everybody your own address?
Or isn't there a man you know who has just
come back from a trip and insists on your
dining with him that night?”
Certainly Maud was helpful. I don’t know
what sort. of a wife she would make; but
£)s one of the other kind she was letter-
perfect.
We arranged a night. I took the precau-
tion—quite a clever one, I thought—-of ring-
ing up Babette at half-past five. Sorry, and
all that, but George Chones had just blown
in. “You remember George, my dear? Yes.
that’s him; you used rather to like him
once—maybe you do now —and I think he
used to like you.” (Eager murmurs from
Babette at the other end of the wire.) “No;
I’m not bringing him home for dinner. Fact
is, he’s just pulled off a big double over the
two Cups, and he insists on my dining with
him and a few other good chaps. Won a
thousand, and means to get rid of some of
it on a dinner. Sorry I did not give you
any warning; but. you see, don’t you, dearest,
that I simply can’t escape? You don’t mind,
Babette, do you?”
There was a lack of enthusiasm in Bab-
ette's coolest voice over the ’phone. “Mean
thing,” she said, “not to have asked me.
But I couldn’t quite catch his name over
the ’phone. A Mr. .Topes, isn’t it?”
“No, no,” I explained—“not Jones, Chones
—dear old George Chones—Ch, not J.”
“Oh!” cooed Babette. “How foolish of
me ! Of course, I know him. dear. Haven’t
seen him for ages. Congratulate him for me,
James. Yes —um —he used to like me quite
a lot.” Her voice cooled even more. “Have
a good time, love; I won't wait up for you.”
Well, Maud met me, a muffled-up enigma,
and we went to one of those places where
the soup synchronises with a fox-trot, and
you jump up and jazz, and find that when
you return the soup is cold; and you miss
most of the other courses because the dance
music is so enchanting. Maud was a mar-
vellous Maud; her flame-colored dress was
certainly startling, but she had considerately
arranged that there was very little of it.
And she could jazz !
“Nice friendly dance, isn’t it?” she cooed
as she snuggled into my arms, one of those
all-over clinches, melting cosily and close.
Her step matched mine, though I was not
conscious of steps. How could a man be
when our steps were one, and the rhythm
of the Chicago tingled in her to her finger-
tips There was so much of herself avail-
able' and on view that I confess I forgot
the rest of her that was so slightly and so
flimsily covered. You have seen a snake
undulate sinuously along—that was Maud.
We danced in silence, doubtless each think-
ing his or her thoughts, or, more probably,
both thinking the same thought —though not
for publication. She imported into her steps
that almost imperceptible wriggle, or wiggle
l’m not sure which —that has so often led
to alimony. And Maud had that dreamy
look in her romantic eyes which meant that
her thoughts were far away—or very, very
close. It was ail ecstatic silence that sang. And
when the music paused I felt the tingle of
her fingers right down to my toes.
I regret to say that I woke up to the fact
that I was a happily married man only when
the colfee and liqueurs came. But by that
time I was too far gone to worry about any-
thing. . .
“I wonder,” I said, after our ninth dance,
“what poor old George Chones is doing with
himself to-night?” and I told Maud of my
cleverness in deceiving poor Babette. Maud
was quite sympathetic. She said she always
had a nasty little qualm when she was danc-
ing with men who ought to be at home with
little wife.v.
I took the dear thing home in a taxi,
though she said that she never wanted to
go home again. We arranged to meet for
another and another night out. and I kissed
her in pledge of that promise, though I knew
that I would never kiss her again. For I
was feeling sorry about my poor little de-
ceived Babette that had spent a lonely dull
night at homo. Sparkling wine, in quantity,
has always that effect on me.
As I apnroached the house I saw a light
in the living-room. Fancy Babette sitting
up so late for me! I quietly let myself in.
but she must have heard me. I hurried to
the living-room and found Babette. Yes. but
there was someone else with her. Who?
And in their attitude I found something dis-
turbing. Babette was lightly jazzing away
from the stranger, humming a little uncon-
scious tune. The man was standing rather
foolishly in the middle of the room.
Instantly the scene that had occurred just
before I arrived flashed through my mind.
The stranger male had just kissed her. or
tried to kiss her —though the two alterna-
tives had probably the same result: and hear-
ing my latchkey in the (loor she had neatly
slipped away from his arms. Otherwise, why
should the tw r o be standing, and why should
Babette be such a safe distance from him
now? A perfect picture of innocence was
Babette. but I had long learnt that when
she looked as innocent as she appeared that
dreadful moment she was full of low cun-
ning. And the man’s disappointed attitude
told me that I had not arrived a moment
too soon.
Nice treatment for a husband wdio had
been out dining with a dear male friend to
find his wife, when he thankfully returned
homo, just out of the arms of an unknown
intruder! I confess I felt aggrieved.
“So it’s you. Tames, at this awful hour!”
Babette patiently remarked. “Lucky for yon,
though, that I had somebody to keep me
company. Let me introduce you—but. of
course, you’ve met before! It’s only dear old
George, you know.”
The stranger turned round. I knew him.
It did not need Babette's provocative cool
voice.
“Yes, it’s George—George Chones. dearest.
You rang me up about him at dinner-time,
you remember? Wasn’t it a peculiar coin-
cidence that wdien you were talking to me
over the ’phone he was here beside me at
the ’phone?”
“Yes, old chap,” said the recovered George
Chones, “I invited myself over to dinner
to-night. Took a chance, you know.”
“You did !” laughed Babette.
“Awfully sorry that you were kept in
town.” George hurried on. “But, anyhow.
I found the missus in. Had a delightful
evening, and was just saying good-bye when
—or —you arrived.”
“Have a spot, old man.” I urged him.
“Thanks, no,” he demurred. “Little wifc.v
has seen to that. And now I really must
go. Never knew it was so late.” He turned
to Babette, whose baffling smile was still on
her lips.
With his departure Babette and I looked
at each other. It was the awful hour, for
explanations.
“Rotten luck, old chap,” she murmured
to me. “Fancy picking the very man who
came here to-night! Well, what was she
like? And when are you going to take.her
out again? You ought to give me warning,
because George will always be available. Oh,
goodness, lam sleepy! Let’s get to bed!”
That night Babette’s kiss was one out of
the ice-cliest. She said she didn’t like- the
taste of the rouge on my lips. But when one
day she imperceptibly melted and remarked
that she really must have a new jazzing frock
I managed to make it up. What hurts,
though, is that she blames me; but then a
woman can wriggle out of anything except
her suspenders.

The Story of Two Men
who started side by side
j HEY CAME UP through the
1 public schools together and
started work in the same
office at a few shillings a week.
Those were joyous, care-free
days. They lunched at cheap
restaurants; they saved enough
for sports on Saturday afternoon
or the theatre Saturday night.
The years stretched out far
ahead. Without thinking very
definitely about the future, they
knew that sometime ‘things
would break’’ if only they did
their work and kept their health.
So for three years they
moved along evenly, receiving
petty salary increases and enjoy-
ing the thrill of the new game.
They met two young women and
became engaged.
Then, along in their fourth
business year, there came a
change. One said: “After all
this business game is pretty
tough. It’s a fight. I wonder
what I can do about it.”
He insured himself against
failure.
He found in the Alexander
Hamilton Institute a definite plan
of business reading which gave
him a new impulse and new self-
confidence. As an extra locomo-
tive hitched to a train makes its
power felt from the first moment,
he was conscious immediately
that a new, fresh force was at
work for his business and finan-
cial progress.
He talked to his friend about
it, and the friend was interested.
“Probably a good thing,” he said
in his easy-going way. But the
matter never went further, and
gradually the two found that
their interests were diverging.
Both were working harder than
ever. But one was thinking;
and in the office the executives
watched them both and saw that
one of them did think.
Ten years passed, and some-
what to their surprise they found
themselves on the threshold of
middle age. One of them has
arrived. He has experienced
the big satisfaction of succeeding
while he is still young. The
other still works and wonders,
and does not quite understand.
Ten years look long, but they
pass with almost unbelievable
rapidity. Will you, in justice to
yourself, spend fifteen minutes
with the question: “Where will I
be in business ten years from
now?” May we send you a little
book called “Forging Ahead in
Business”—an interesting book
of helpful facts and letters?
This book is yours for
the asking.
When you have read it
quietly, without pressure or
haste, you may decide that the
Institute has something of value
to offer you. This may be true
if you are director of a business
(more than 27,000 managers
and business heads have followed
the Course and are enthusiastic
about it). It may be equally true
if you are at the very beginning
of your career, for among the
250,000 men enrolled are some
whose business position and
salary were precisely like yours.
But whether you decide to go
further or not depends entirely
on yourself. The facts will come
to you without obligation or cost.
Simply fill in the coupon —but do
it to-day!

Isko Automatic Electric Freezing Machines
Your own Cold Storage
Plant at Home.
ISKO is a simple device that
Manufactures Cold, convert-
ing your Refrigerator into a
miniature, self-operating Cold-
storage plant connected with the
house current, doing away entirely
with the use of Ice in the home as
a refrigerating agent, at the same
time introducing a method of
food preservation more conveni-
ent, more sanitary, more economi-
cal than that afforded by blocks
of melting ice.
It is an independent unit, can
be attached to any refrigerator or
Ice-box, and is absolutely fool-
proof.
It is automatic in operation and
so simplified mechanically that it
needs no expert attention.
It makes fifty cubes of Ice every
day.
The cost of current is trifling,
and the machine can be worked
on any voltage from 32 Volts up-
wards.
A complete model of this Isko
Automatic machine of one-ton
capacity, suitable for Residential
Hotels, Butchers, etc., is avail-
able.

Refrigerator Cabinets made to order and machines fitted.
THE chambers and motor are
mounted on a single base,
which may be set on top of
the refrigerator or in an adjoining
room. The glycerine-tank, made
in sizes to fit various standard re-
frigerators, is placed in the ice
compartment and connected to
the machine by two seamless
copper tubes. The only moving
parts of Isko are the the two rotat-
ing gears of the compressor,
which run submerged in a sealed
chamber of oil and are direct con-
nected to the
motor. The refrigerant—a harm-
less gas—is also sealed in its
chamber. When cooled under
moderate pressure it becomes a
liquid, and as such is supplied to
the expansion coil of the tank,
where it expands into gaseous
form, extracting the heat from the
chest. When it has absorbed its
quota of heat the compressor re-
moves it from the expansion coil
and delivers it to the condenser
chamber, where the water, circu-
lating through the cooling coils,
carries off the heat, and the gas
again becomes a liquid and is
ready to start on another journey.
This simple process is carried on
in continuous cycles. Isko is auto-
matically operated, aand can be set
to maintain any suitable degree of
cold in the refrigerator, the cur-
rent clicking on and oiff at the pre-
determined temperatures.

“—Unsurpassed by Cars of
twice the size and price.”
347 Livingstone Road,
Marrickville,
Sydney, Australia,
24th May, 1924.
MESSRS. HUMBER, LTD., Coventry.
Dear Sirs,—You will be interested to hear how one of your 8-li.p.
Humbers is performing in Australia, where we have the worst roads in
the world.
Over 2000 miles over these vile roads and not a second’s trouble, or
cause to tighten one single nut. Am going over 40 miles to the gallon.
The way my Humber holds the roads is an eye-opener to everyone. It
is practically silent at all speeds; the steering is wonderful, and the finish
right through is only what you would expect from Humber.
She is an absolute pleasure to drive, and the comfort and leg room is
not surpassed by cars of twice the size and double the price. ’ I am proud
of my little car, and if at any time I buy a larger car it will be a Humber.
There is no salesman living who can convince me that any 6-cylinder
car will run any better than a 5-cylinder Humber. Long may the high-grade
British car lead the w r ay to all others.
Yours very sincerely.

Humber Motor Cycles.
The Humber 2f-h.p. Single-cylinder Motor-cycle has achieved
phenomenal success in many strenuous tests, and astonished
the experts with its extraordinary stamina and consistent
reliability. It is simple to control even in the hands ol the
novice. It will pay you to investigate its merits.

visiting any part of Victoria, or other States, may arrange with
the Branch at which his account is kept to have money available
at call at his place of destination.

come the difficulty of obtaining identification in the town where
payment is required to be made. The necessity for carrying about
money in excess of immediate requirements is also avoided.

if payment is made in another State of the Commonwealth a small
charge is made. The following Banks act as Agents for the State
Savings Bank of Victoria in other States, viz.:—
