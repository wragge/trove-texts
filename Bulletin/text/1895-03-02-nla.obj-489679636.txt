MARK FOY,
Of Sydney, is now having One Thousand young
Parrots taught to say the following words —
“You will get it cheaper at Mark Foy’s.”
And these birds will be liberated throughout the Australian

Don’t shoot a “Mark Foy Parrot.”
Their advice is golden to all.

PI‘LE they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
froiife rank of Curative Mtedici-nes.
For years the medicine had only a loeal and limited

colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, la confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.

We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a "Liver Pill to be used alone, or in oonjunetion

or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.

trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,

A BIG BIZI
Our Trade is Big 1 Our Store is Big 1
Our Ideas are Big]
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us I All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a lung way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.

Cupid at Sea .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They were fellow-passengers on an ocean liner,
and I became the confidant of both.
He was going out to marry the usual “dearest
girl in the world ; ’’ she, to rejoin her husband.
It grew monotonous, after a while, listening to
the transports of each; but, gradually, I was
dropped, and they became inseparable. I heard
nothing now of the “dearest girl,” etc., and very
little of the husband.
Melbourne, at last. There is a family party to
meet him ; the husband only to welcome her. Ah,
madame, 1 thought, that is not the way you kissed
him last night!
“Old man,” he said, as we drove to the wed-
ding, “I ought to be shot for marrying this girl;
but I am not quite villain enough to jilt her.”
She was there, near the door, as we left the
church ; white to the lips.

“ A pessimist is a person whose mind is
divided between the belief that things are as bad
as they can be and the expectation that they will
presently become a lot worse.”— American.
An economical Auckland (M.L.) suicide
put on his oldest clothes and a pair of cast-off
boots, and left his watch, umbrella, and spectacles
at home, when he went out to drown himself. He
also put his hat on a dry spot on the shore before
he waded in. Which was solid wisdom. Many a
good hat has been spoiled through the owner
drowning himself with it on.

regularly as soon as their term expires.” The
average warrior’s patriotism is simply conceit :
We expect the proud, bedizened man of blood
To strike for home and beanty when requested,
Or to wade in gore or wallow in the mud
If that course by his superior’s suggested.
E’en to face a Russian horde he’s not afraid,
And to smash a Chinese army ma 3» be trusted,
But he dreads to meet a saucy nursery maid
When his regulation pants are badly busted.
Some English people have ghoulsome ideas
about the qualifications of a successful colonist.
In London, a few weeks ago, a youth of “good
family ’ nearly sawed off a woman’s head with a
knife, and his tutor explained at the inquest that
he used to practise with the weapon on the furni-
ture, “so as to get his hand in for emigrating.”
When he got his hand in sufficiently by disem-
bowelling the furniture, he proposed buying a
large hat and going to Maoriland, where he
intended to be a species of Arizona Bill. The
same mail brings a report about a “well-con-
nected ” lady of 17 and her husband of 21, who
were convicted of stealing a large quantity of
jewellery, but were released on condition they
went to the same long-suffering “ kawliney.”
That Undesirable Emigrants’ Bill is going to be
badly wanted, after all.

Dear Bulletin,— Re N-.S.W. Civil Service
Commissioner.!. C. Neild. Of course, his appoint-
ment was a scandal. But politics are one long
scandal. What think you of the “How-old’s-
your-mothers ” rushing at Supreme Court Judges
to decide to which “Boaz” certain raggeries and
“jewels’’(and perchance the goat?) belonged by
law? Nearly every Supreme Court Judge is a
Mason. Should a Masonic Judge be allowed to
try a Masonic cause ? It may be asked—who so
fit? And echo furnishes no answer. Should a
male Judge be allowed to try a male cause ? That’s
not it. What I started out to say till the Masonic
goat butted me into the bypath of unreason was—
in my opinion, an Australian Judge should be
allowed to try anything, no matter what his own
complexion may be, provided that he could always
be pulled up with a jerk if necessary. It is time
that Australia absolutely knew no Greens,
Oranges, or Polychromes at all, and simply
laughed them out of the land. One way of doing
this would be just to appoint your chums (a la
Neild) and let things slide. When my brother
Bill gets into “ office ” I’m going to be made Chief
Taster of the State Drink Department. And then,
I suppose, some envious camel will write to the
papers objecting that I am — Dipso.

An Anglican clergyman preached in Gipps-
land, the other day, from the text, “Be still and
know that lam God.” “Yes, my hearers,” he
said, “ this text should be always before you as
the following incident will prove. Two travellers
in India got separated in the forest, and one, feel-
ing tired, sat down on what looked like a log, but
shortly after the log began to move, and he saw
that it was a rattlesnake, which so stunned him
that he sprang up and died. Had this text been
before him he would have sat still and been saved
—hence you see,” &c. But surely any man who
sees a rattlesnake big enough to sit down on is
warranted in concluding that life is a sham.
We have to call attention to the fact that
the list for the Van Diemen’s Land Bank lottery
will positively close at the end of the present
month, and it behoves all those who intend taking
a chance in this monster concern, to send in their
applications at once to Geo. Adams, Hobart and
Brisbane.

Still Waiting
The latest Foreign-trade Cabinet of New
South Wales has now been seven months in
office, and the people are still waiting for
the first beginnings of that Freetrade tariff
which is so very slow to arrive. The country
has an avowedly Freetrade Government,
and an allegedly Freetrade Parliament, and
at the same time it has the same tariff which
was imposed by the late Protectionist
Government, and the fiscal policy of the
latter is being followed in every respect.
Under these anomalous circumstances, if the
province shows signs of prosperity they are
ascribed by the Reid party to the fact that a
Foreign-trade Ministry is in office ; and if it
doesn’t show signs of prosperity its troubles
f,re set down to the fact that a Protectionist
tariff is still in force ; and if it shows no
definite signs either way, but remains prac-
tically the same, its quiescence is set down to
the fact that the evils of the protective tariff
are alleviated by the blessed knowledge that
Freetrade is coming steadily near.er. Thus
the Reid aggregation, as a Freetrade Govern-
ment with a Protectionist tariff, is in a posi-
tion to claim that if things go wrong it
proves that the country owes a debt of grati-
tude to the Ministry, and if they go right
that fact also proves that the country owes a
debt of gratitude to the Ministry, and if
they don’t go any way in particular that
proves still more definitely that the country
owes a very great debt of gratitude to the
Ministry. The Reid Cabinet is in no hurry
to abolish this comfortable state of things, so
when other means of postponing the estab-
lishment of Freetrade failed it closed up
Parliament for nine weeks, and went forth to
show the country that, whichever way things
went, it owed a great debt of gratitude to
the Ministry.
• « •
Meanwhile, the situation is growing com.
plicated. The Reid Government, in the
early days of its career, promised to revert
to the old style of revenue tariff, which
yields about £2,000,000 a year by levying
taxes on goods which are not manufactured
in the province, and thereby enhances prices
without assisting any industry, or furnishing
anybody with employment, or doing any
good to any member of the community. It
proposed to get about £2,000,000 from this
source, and £500,000 or £600,000 from direct
taxation, and the reduction of the Customs
revenue to the aforesaid £2,000,000 was to
be the lifting of a great burden off the com-
munity. Unfortunately, however, there is
no burden to be lifted. The revenue derived
from the Protective tariff has steadily de-
clined. In 1892, the burden of this tariff
upon the community amounted to £2.677,890.
In 1893, it fell to £2,127,645. In 1894, it
further reduced itself to £2,065,838. Next
year, and in the years that come after, if the
same system remains in force, a further
reduction may be expected. In this respect
the N.S. W. tariff only follows the inevitable
law of protective tariffs in general. In
the first year of its existence, before any
new local industries had time to develope,
it produced a large revenue. In the
second and third, as local production in-
creased, and the province began to spend its
money in paying wages to local workers, in-
stead of sending it abroad to pay wages to
workers in other countries, imports dimin-
ished steadily, and the Customs-tax—the
burden which is laid on the community—
steadily declined. It is always the tendency
of the protective tariff to decrease, while the
incubus of the revenue tariff always tends to
grow larger, because it is carefully adjusted
so as not to create any local industry, -or to
do anything which may tend to reduce im-
ports. Therefore, in a so-called Freetrade
country, the most esteemed sign of prosperity
is that the Customs duties increase, and the
load of Customs taxation grows heavier ;
while in a protected country the infallible
sign of progress is the decline of Customs
revenue and the consequent diminution of
the “burden” concerning which so much
has been heard.
* # #
The Customs returns of New South Wales
for 1894 are lower than the returns under
the Foreign-trade revenue system—the same
system which the Government promises to
restore—in 1886 and 1887, and not much
more than they amounted to in 1888-’9O. The
financial policy which Premier Reid promises
is, therefore, to charge the people just about
the same amount of money for destroying
native industries as the present system
does for fostering them. So far as the
Customs is concerned, there is to be no
reduction of taxes and no easing of the
much-advertised “ burden ” —it is to be the
same old burden under another name.
Moreover, something like £500,000 or
£600,000 is to be levied Ly direct taxation,
nominally to make up for a reduction which
doesn’t exist, and isn’t likely to exist. The
fact that Premier Reid’s revenue tariff, as
shown by many years’ experience, yields
practically the same amount as his pre-
decessor’s protective tariff did in the imme-
diate past, and more than it will do in the im-
mediate future, doesn’t assort well with the
former’s assertion that he adheres to the
present evil system as a matter, of neces-
sity, in order to get revenue until his new
proposals become law. The way to get
revenue is to go back at once to the old
Parkesian Freetrade, which was an income-
producing machine pure and simple. The
man who professes that he reluctantly
adheres to a hated policy which is now
yielding £2,000,000 a year, because he dare
not adopt a noble line of conduct which will
also yield £2,000,000 a year, until he gets
£500,000 extra revenue to fill the gap which
isn’t there, is past all human belief.
* # *
What the prospects of the Land and In-
come-tax may be under present conditions no
one can definitely say. So far every effort
seems to have been made to delay that
unfortunate bill, which was still left
stranded in the Assembly at the be-
ginning of the nine weeks’ vacation.
Presumably, however, it must come before
the Council sooner or later, and that
body will assuredly reject it if any plausible
reason for so doing can be found. The only
form of'pressure which is likely to induce
the Chamber of Fat Men to pass a measure
so contrary to all its instincts is absolute
want of revenue and tjie pressure of financial
necessity. In the present case there
is no such pressure to allege ; the pre-
sent tariff, and the one which Premier
Reid promises to restore, yield the same
amount of revenue, and the country which
pays its way on one can do so also on
the other. If the protective system were
maintained, the steady fall in the Customs
“burden” would presently make direct
taxation necessary, but the Foreign-trade
revenue tariff policy makes the burden
steady and continuous, and there is no fall
to be provided for. Direct taxation is the
natural concomitant of Protection, because
scientific Protection reduces the indirect
revenue to something approaching a vanish-
ing point, and if an absolutely perfect
system of Protection could be de-
vised there would presently be no Cus-
toms revenue whatever. Direct taxation
and a Foreign-trade revenue tariff are
generally found incompatible, because so
long as there is a Conservative Upper House
to block the way, the former is only resorted
to as a matter of hard necessity, and the
revenue tariff is so beautifully elastic that
the necessity is difficult to find.
* * *
Premier Reid’s situation is somewhat
anomalous. He and his party and his
political faith live on the assertion that
Protection -is a grinding system which
extiacts vast sums from the pockets of the
masses, and the Treasury returns prove
that Protection, as it now exists in New
South Wales, exacts no more than his own
policy of alleged freedom, and is likely in the
future to exact less. The cause of his poli-
tical existence was that he was going to lift
oft’ the country the extra burden laid on it
by his predecessors, and there is no burden
to lift. He proposed, if necessary, to appeal
to the country on the Land and Income Tax
Bill, on the ground that the tax was absolutely
necessary to enable him to relieve the people
of a load of superfluous taxation, and the
load being already gone, the appeal doesn’t
tit the case. He professed to be reluctantly
postponing the abolition of Protection because
the revenue which it yielded was a tem-
porary necessity, but, as his own beautiful
system yields quite as much revenue, the
only visible reason for postponement is that
he is afraid of his own policy, or else that he
lacks the ability to str/ke out a course for
himself. He professed a desire to push on
his direct-taxation scheme with all possible
despatch so that Protection might be
abolished, and then he needlessly suspended
all business for nine weeks, leaving his great
measure stranded, and for no apparent
reason save to get away from it as long
as possible. All which circumstances sug-
gest that Premier Reid is not specially
anxious on the subject of direct taxation ;
that he has no urgent desire to appeal to the
country either on that subject or on any
other ; that he undertook to lift a burden off
the people without any definite idea what
the burden was or where it was to be found ;
that his arithmetic is loose and his facts
exceedingly uncertain ; and that his states-
manship consists not so much in doing
things himself as in complaining of
the things which his predecessor left
undone. Meanwhile, the province has been
waiting a long time for the coming of that
Freetrade which has been promised so often,
and it is getting tired. The spectacle of a
Freetrade Ministry peacefully administering
a Protectionist tariff month after month, and
doing nothing worth speaking of to remove
it, is beginning to grow ludicrous.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Minimum Wage in Victoria.
A board of highly-paid civil servants was
recently appointed by the Victorian Ministry
to make recommendations with regard to the
Assembly’s resolution that a minimum wage
should be provided in future Government con-
tracts, to avoid sweating. Despite all the
literature and experiment on this subject, the
board confessed to a highly-paid state of in-
efficiency. It did not know what sweating was
—it did not know what the minimum wage-
principle was. Finally, it officially submitted
for selection, with ignorance almost too dense
to be real, the three following wrong definitions
of a minimum wage :
( 1 ) A living wage.
(2) A rate which would leave a man something above
the mere cost of living.
(3) The standard rate of the particular trade in which a
man worked.
The first definition, “a living wage,” signifies
such a sum as will barely keep body and soul
together—the sweater himself pays “ a living
wage ” because if he did not his victim would
die. The second definition implies that a man
would not be sweated if his wage provided
“ something ” above the mere cost of living—a
qualified mason, for instance, in the pursuit of
his trade, would not be sweated if he were paid
hod-carrier’s wages. The third definition
marks the apex of the board’s real or simulated
ignorance, viz.—ls the minimum wage the stan-
dard of the particular trade? As the present
standard of many trades is actually a sweaters’
standard this board could not have drafted a
more wooden-headed question. It was ap-
pointed to provide against sweaters’ wages on
Government contracts, and it gravely enquires,
after deliberation, whether sweaters’ wages
should be officially recognised. It is satis-
factory to be able to turn from this melancholy
display of incompetence, or insubordination,
whichever it is, to the action of Works Minister
Taverner. Taverner spent part of a holiday
in Sydney in a practical inquiry into the work-
ing of the New South Wales minimum wage
clauses, and returned to Vic. prepared with a
recommendation. The New South Wales sche-
dule is as follows :
Taverner proposed to allow the aforesaid
board to decompose, and himself recommended
that the Sydney rates (to the exclusion of the
country rates) should obtain on Govern-
ment contracts throughout Victoria. The
Bulletin scores one to Taverner. The
Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works
having renewed the discussion on the same
question, Commissioner Turner arose in his
might to declare how a saving of £465 was
made on a £37,000 contract, by leaving the
workmen to the mercy of the contractor.
Wherefrom, he argued that on the board’s pro-
posed expenditure of £2,000,000, £25,000 would
be saved, at the rate of £6250 per annum, by
banning the minimum wage. Otherwise this
mighty proportion of the ratepayers’ money
would be spent—horrible to tell—on rate-
payers. Wherefore the minimum wage is ana-
thema. Commissioner Walstab also opposed
the principle. He said :
No man in this country was such a fool as to work for
less than he was worth, and it was against all ideas of
liberty to insist that an employer should pay more than
he thought the man he hired deserved.
The man who says that no man in Victoria, or
in any other country, is working for less than
he is worth, is such a final possibility in the
way of a fool that he ought to be unique.
A Voice from Manchester.
Every Freetrader, so far as The Bulletin’s
personal experience goes, is an ardent Protec-
tionist where his own especial interests are
concerned. Eyeglass Reid, the head of the
New South Wales Freetrade party, believes in
being protected in every possible way against
the intrusion of outsiders into his own close
corporation of the law. Also, the S.M. Herald,
Telegraph and Evening News believe strongly
in being protected against the country press,
by having their goods carried at the public cost
all over the province, and delivered gratis by
the State in every town, so as to compete with
the local editor whose paper has to be delivered
mostly at his own expense—in other words,
they believe in being subsidised by the State to
the extent of a copy. Now another interest-
ing sample of the typical Freetrader, who wants
Protection for himself and Freetrade for every-
body else, comes to hand from Manchester.
The Indian Government, some time ago, being
desperately hard-up and struggling against a
huge annual deficiency, attempted to impose
a small revenue-duty—only 5 per cent.—
on imported cottons. The Manchester manu-
facturers, how'ever, protested so violently in
the interests of their own cotton export trade
that the British Government disallowed the
tax, and left India to struggle with her chronic
deficiency as best she could. The shortage
grew steadily larger, as shortages have a habit
of doing, and when at last insolvency began to
loom very near at hand, the Indian authorities
again attempted to impose a duty on cotton
imports. This time it was decided, with a
view of placating the Lancashire Freetrader, to
tax English and locally-made goods at the same
rate, so that there should be no shadow of Pro-
tection against the grasping Manchester manu-
facturer. But even this did not satisfy the
English cotton-spinner, and again a fearsome
how I goes up from the dirty city by the Irwell.
The Manchester Chamber of Commerce doesn’t
object in the least to the Indian Government
taxing the local article, but it demands that the
English one shall go in absolutely free, no
matter whether India is bankrupt or not—
in other words, it is quite willing that
India shall protect the English as against
the Indian producer, but it won’t have
Protection for the native producer at any
price, or under any circumstances. If
money must be raised, however, it suggests
that, in place of taxing Manchester cottons for
revenue purposes, India should be subsidised
by Britain—in other words, that the British
taxpayer should indirectly subsidise the Man-
chester trade. This in itself was a beautiful
instance of Freetrade, but the climax was
reached when a bloated ghoul belonging to
the Chamber complained of India admitting
cotton-spinning machinery free, and demanded
that it should be taxed—in order to hamper
the local industry and give Manchester an ad-
vantage over India in the latter’s own markets.
After this The Bulletin’s belief in Man-
chester as a centre of Freetrade falls to zero.
The difference between the average Freetrader
and the average Protectionist is that the former
w'ants his own industry protected while every-
body else’s industry is exposed to the competi-
tion of all the world, wdiereas the latter wants
his own industry protected, but is willing that
other people’s should be protected likewise.
And the difference between the Manchester
Freetrader and the ordinary kind is just the
difference between a shark and a devil-fish, or
between mortification and gangrene.
Uneven-Handed “Justice.”
A London magistrate has boldly dismissed the
Anti-Gambling League’s summons against the
almighty Jockey Club, for keeping betting-en-
closures at Newmarket. Furthermore, ~ the
bench refused to state a case for a superior
court, so the league, by this time, has probably
stated its own case to the British public and
put the awful dishonesty of gambling laws in a
strong light. The anomaly of permitting big
betting at one place and arresting small book-
makers at another, by virtue of an Act which
pretends to have a great moral aspect, will not
bear a strong light. The London beak who
said there was no case to state “ under the
Act ” deserves to be bracketed with the Mel-
bourne beak who wouldn’t grant a summons
againt Matthew Davies, and the Attorney-
General who entered a nolle 'prosequi when
Matthew was committed for trial. Gaming is
not licensed in Great Britain any more than
eccentric balance-sheets are legally sanctioned
in Victoria. The oppressive puritanism of
the league aforesaid may seem to justify a
conspiracy to laugh it out of court, but
when the public think seriously about this
bit of bluff they will soon leave off chuckling.
Sa\' that the Newmarket ring is reserved for
'‘betting on the nod,” and that no money
changes hands there—which, by the way, is not
a solid fact. Well, the law is not meant to be
evaded by such transparent shams. Besides,
there are cash bookmakers galore on New-
market Heath, doing with impunity the same
tiling which the police wouldn’t let them do in
private offices in town. Even a costermonger
is allowed to gamble in peace at the place
where dukes are doing likewise. Betting clubs
escape prosecution, or otherwise, just according
to the average social standing and money influ
ence of their customers. A silver hell is raided
— Tattersall’s is left alone. There is but ono


•Gaming Act, and (like the lash in Aus-
tralia) it is applied only to the poorer
■classes, in the ordinary way. Sometimes, for-
sooth, an irate nobleman “lays the police on
to” a richly-gilded hell in which one of his
young relatives is being fleeced, and the toney
institution is surrounded and entered by the
Law as though it were a working-men’s club
where a roulette-table flourishes. Neverthe-
less, if the sergeant happens to discover a prince
on the premises he slinks out again, and the
prosecution doesn’t occur. The Gaming Act is
a more grovelling respecter of persons than
any other law, and this is saying a good deal.
A policeman can, without the least danger to
his billet, be more flagrantly corrupt when
dealing with this Act, than at any other time.
Indeed, he has special instructions from head-
quarters to wallow in corruption rather than
offend the aristocracy. The Anti-Gambling
League is seemingly trying to bring a maf-
odorous abscess to a head, and the abortive
prosecution of the Jockey Club was an excellent
poultice. Great Britain needs anew Gaming
Act, decently enforced; and Australia, which
slavishly imitates the existing Hinglish scandal,
is interested in its exposure.
Putting Down Anarchism.
J. A. Andrews, the gentle, mild-eyed, theo-
retical Anarchist, was recently sentenced, at
Sydney, to five months’ imprisonment, for
“ seditious language ” and attempting to “ pro-
voke tumult and riot by evilly-disposed per-
sons,” and advocating bloodshed generally. " In
the course of his deliverance, Judge Simpson
pointed out that Andrews’ doctrines were
“ wild and trashy, and would only influence
the ignorant and weak-minded,” and that
“ language such as he had published could not
be tolerated.” The Law has a profound esteem
for the efficacy of five months’ imprisonment as
a means of putting down “ seditious language,”
but, when it starts out to suppress this kind of
iniquity, it generally makes an ass of itself.
No one took Andrews seriously until the Law
took him seriously ; but when this* large, heavy,
well-fed institution fell upon him, and pro-
fessed to regard him as a dangerous per-
son, it thereby drew attention to him, and
gave his doctrines publicity. A great
many more people heard of him and his
theories through the medium of the law-reports
than would have ever heard of them through
any other channel. Andrews in the flesh, as a
thin, tired, dreamy-looking man, holding forth
with a weak voice in the Domain, was a stand-
ing advertisement of the hannlessness of his
own ideas ; Andrews, depicted in the public
mind as a hulking, revolutionary ruffian in
gaol, looks like the forerunner of a Reign of
Terror. If Andrews and his crowd really
meant, as alleged, to fill the land with murder
and devastation, five months in a tolerably
comfortable gaol will no more deter them than
a fine of 2s. 6d. would have stopped Robes-
pierre ; if they didn’t mean anything, then the
law made an idiotic blunder in professing to
think that they did. Moreover, if the law
was seriously of opinion—as it professed to be
that Andrews was an inciter to murder and
insurrection, it would have been much more
likely to give him ten years’ imprisonment than
five months, and the sentence passed was in
itself an evidence that the legal machine had tried
its best to take the matter in dead earnest, and
failed. .A Government of more intelligence than
the present, if it really wished to suppress
the harmless, but discordant variety of Domain
oratory, would have had the audience “ moved
on” by the police, apd have prosecuted the
alleged bloodthirsty leader for being unlawfully
on the grass, or on some similar charge. Similarly,
the Government of Louis Phillippe, if it had
been a shade more intelligent than it was,
would have “run in” Napoleon for three
mouths, after the fiasco with the bacon and the
tame eagle at Boulogne, for having no visible
means of support and carrying around an evil-
smelling bird, instead of sending him to the
fortress of Ham as a dangerous insurrectionist.
And, apart from all other considerations, there
is something touching in Judge Simpson’s
belief that any kind of opinion, or
in y kind of language, can be put down
by giving anybody five months, or even
ten. Also, his professed belief that the offence
“ was the first of its kind in the colony,” is a
beautiful example of judicial ignorance. The
same offence can be heard every Saturday night
in any threepenny “pub.” in Sydney, or in
almost any street, or lane or alley, and
in many other places besides. Nobody
means anything in particular by it, as a
rule, and hardly anybody supposes that any-
body else means anything by it. The Anarchist
who does mean anything doesn’t orate in public,
and wave his arms and his hat in the air, and
give the police notice that he is coming. When
_ ® Sydney police find an Anarchist it is
sufficient evidence, as a rule, that he isn’t one.
Railway Logic.
A strong opposition is being worked up in the
INew South Wales Assembly against the reap-
pointment of Railway Commissioner Eddy at a
salary of £4OOO a year, and it is just possible
that the Reid Government may yet collapse
over this appointment—the most statesmanlike
act of its career up to date. The opposition is
based partly on the great and beautiful prin-
ciple of Government by Contradict ion, and
partly the score of alleged economy. A
Railway Commissioner—some kind of one, that
is could easily be got for <£2ooo, whereby, it
is pointed out, £2OOO a year would be saved to
p revenue. Also, some kind of a Railway
Commissioner could be got quite as easily for
£IOOO a year, or even £SOO, and a good many
dozen people would take the billet gladly at £2
a wee k ; therefore there seems to be a wide-
spread opinion that the- proposed salary is
exorbitant. Certain Opposition members will
oppose the appointment on the ground that it
is worth while to get rid of the only successful
manager New South Wales has yet had, and I ■
alow any kind of cheap incapable to find
with £55,000,000 worth of State properly,
l in 16 M^*i® ff ry can thereby be shunted out of
office. This action comes under the head of
corruption in its most undisguised form, but
Party Government is all corruption. Another
group of politicians who are not corrupt, but
only bigoted and honestly idiotic, will oppose it
because their whole process of logic is based on
the back-blocks shearer, and if a quick shearer
can only make about .£1 a day they fail to see
why a Minister of State, or a Railway Com-
missioner, or a J udge, or a bank manager should
get more. These belong to that ghastly section
of the political world which knows no form of
labor except the muscular variety, and refuses
to recognise the value of brains in any shape
whatsoever. The country, however, has to
consider the matter in its own interests, and
altogether apart from party politics or the
shearer variety of logic. A successful railway
manager requires brains far beyond the average,
and if New South Wales won’t pay for the
brains someone else will. It requires long experi-
ence, and experience is also a marketable com-
modity ; also great strength of will, a capacity
for administration, and incorruptible honesty.
Possibly it may be proved that these things
shouldn’t be paid for, but the fact remains that
the world does pay for them, and they can’t be
got except at a high figure. The province pays
its Premier £IB2O a-year, and its Chief Justice
£3500, for no visible reason except that it can’t
get good men for much less; and, even at this
figure, it often gets bad men, because good men
are not to be found at the moment they are
wanted. A successful railway manager, accord-
ing to the experience of Australia and America,
is even more rare than a successful Premier or
C.J. Where such immense interests are at
stake, a good manager at even £20,000 a-year is
cheaper than one just a little inferior at
nothing at all. On an income of £2,800,000
a-year a saving of one halfpenny in
the £ means nearly £60,000 additional
profit, and the man who knows how to save
that last halfpenny is well worth £20,000 a
year more than the man who doesn’t. Up to
date, Commissioner Eddy has proved himself
to be that man, but if the country can find
another man who knows how to save another
farthing in the £, without in any way impairing
the efficiency of the service, then it will find it
more profitable to hire him at £14,0.00 a year
than Mr. Eddy at £IOOO. But just now it
doesn’t know where to find him, and as experi-
ments are risky and its present manager is
worth over £IOO,OOO a year more than anyone
it previously had, he should be retained, even
at a heavy cost, until the other genius turns up.
The opposition to the Eddy salary means partly
that some members who know better are play-
ing to the gallery ; partly that some members
want to turn out the present Ministry and
jump their salary ; but it means first of all that
the hungry, not to say ravenous, politician
longs to have the railway patronage in his
pocket as in the squalid and corrupt days of
old.
Hear Bulletin, —The much-abused second
chamber would be well enough but for the
Party system. History proves the danger and
instability of a single chamber, and, as Macau-
lay observes in his essay on Addison, an Upper
House, if elective, would be free from the only
check placed on it by the machinery of the
English Constitution. It is not the principle
of the Upper House that is in fault so much as
the manner in which it is recruited. The
exigencies of Party require that the nominees
shall be men of property, able to give to the
party funds, or partisans rewarded for past
ervices or placated for disappointment in some
other direction. Who can wonder that a cham-
ber is Tory when every vacancy is filled by
Fatman, pure and simple, or some disappointed
and worn-out politician freed for life from the
only check that had kept him in order—the
ballot-box ? When anew batch is appointed do
we find the best available men selected ? Cer-
tainly not. The wisdom of a Solon does nob
weigh against Party services and Party con-
venience. When Premiers and Governors will
strive to select the men most likely to serve
the country we shall have no fault to find with
the Upper House. I prefer a nominee House to
an elective one, and think that, under the
Party system, an hereditary chamber like the
Lords—anomalous, I admit—will work better
than a nominee one.—Yours, V.
An Australian solicitor, who has lately been to
England on some law business, writes to The
Bulletin : —“ My experience of the Privy
Council has convinced me that nothing should
satisf}' a true Australian except a Federal
Appeal Court. We have satisfactory material
here, as admitted by the proposal to give Aus-
tralian Judges a seat at Downing-street, and it
is simply an outrage that litigants should be
dragged to the other end of the world to finally
settle their disputes. The Privy Council
Judges have the greatest contempt for ‘colonial’
Judges, and don’t hesitate to express it. Such
a remark as ‘ Is that the sort of stuff they call
evidence in Australia ? ’ shows that this is so.
At another time one of these gentlemen re-
marked of an Australian Judge: ‘When he
comes to a conclusion on matters of fact no one
can understand him, and when he comes to a
conclusion on a matter of law he is invariably
wrong.’ The Judge in question had a very
large practice—not as an advocate but as a
lawyer—before going on to the Bench.”
It is an instance of the conservatism of the Aus-
tralian farmer that neither in N.S. Wales,
Victoria, S.A., Tasmania, or Maoriland has
any serious effort been made to grow beets on a
large scale for sugar-making purposes. Beet
pays better than sugar-cane, and can be grown
in climates where the cane won’t live. The
beet industry only started in 1840, and then it
furnished only one-sixtieth of the world’s sugar
supply. Now two-thirds of the sugar produced
is made from beet, and the cane is fast becoming
an extinct superstition. France, Germany,
Austria, Russia, and Belgium all now supply
their own requirements with beet sugar,
and have a large balance left for exporta-
tion. Even the United States now grow
more beet than sugar-cane. Britain, where
no new agricultural industry can get a
footing owing to the great principles of
Freetrade, produces none at all and depends
wholly on importations. Australia, which
spends <£1,330,000 per annum in purchasing
95,000 tons of imported sugar to supplement
the local cane supply, should be one of the
greatest beet-sugar growing countries in the
world. But the local agriculturist struggles on
growing wheat in a dull, hopeless fashion with
a view to exporting the surplus to London at a
price which barely pays freight, simply because
it is the correct English thing to grow as much
wheat as possible ; and hardly gives a thought
to the possibilities of this great local demand
which keeps steadily growing. The Australian
farmer is a conservative ass, and—except, per-
haps, in Victoria, where the State makes some
attempts to improve him—it seems to be the
Government policy to keep him so.
A letter to a Maoriland paper :
Sir, —Having occasion to ascertain where someone in
whom I was interested resided, I knocked at a door in the
east end of the city. For a long time no reply came. At
last a voice broke the silence : “Who are you? Are you
a bailiff? Are you sure you are not a bailiff? No, no;
go away. I know you are a bailiff. This is church pro-
perty, and I am expecting the bailiffs every moment. I
scraped twenty-four shillings together-all I could get in
the world—and they would not take it, and I know the
bailiffs will be put in.” Can anything be more disgrace-
ful than the Church as a landlord -a seller-off of the poor,
the widow, and the fatherless, for whom, I suppose,
the “Lord will provide,” and the Church will put
in terror of their lives, will evict, will sell off and leave
destitute and shelterless. “How long, oh Lord?” If
the Church will not desist, will not the State step in and
make compulsory purchase of all Church property, and so
save the C.lurch from itself ? The stigma of letting such
beastly hovels to people by the Church is vile enough
without all the rest. One cannot think of bis Lordship
the Bishop, of Bishop’s Court, and his positive security
therein, without contrasting this poor, shivering, terror-
stricken woman, smitten with abject fear of the Church
bailiff. Surely you will draw attention to the urgent
need of compulsory purchase of Church property.—l am,
&0,, Gomorrah.
At Sydney Agricultural Conference, so far as
The Bulletin is aware, only one essayist, and
that one a man with a foreign-sounding name—
E. D. Van Weenan —set his seal of disap-
proval on one of the greatest curses under
which Australia suffers—the curse of Partyism,
as departmen tally distributed. Only one
speaker was clear-headed enough to advocate
that the Agricultural Department should be
non-political; that, in short, a Minister of
Agriculture is a redundant folly and has no
natural place in party politics. Which is
transparently true, unless it were to be
maintained that one political party or the
other condemns agriculture as unnecessary or
even hurtful! If a Minister of Agriculture,
why not a Minister of Grazing—a Minister for
Cattle and Sheep—a Minister for Hogs ? The
variations of this bureaucratic kaleidoscope
have only got to be shaken about in order to
present to the mind’s eye their utter absurdity.
As said Mr. Van Weenan, there should be a
practical Board of Agriculture, disassociated
from party politics—permanent in its constitu-
tion and merely administrative.
Dear Bulletin, —Professional philanthropy—
when it isn’t humbug—is largely dunder-
headedness. “ Conversion and kindness,” says
Mrs. Nolan, of the W.C.T. U. (re reform of
female inebriates), “are the only tw'o things I
can think of,” which is fresh proof that the only
person who has any conception of what alco-
holism means is—the alcoholist! Most of
those w'ho seek to reclaim the inebriate
are working absolutely in the dark, or
they wouldn’t talk twaddle about chemi-
cal specifics for the body or spiritual
nostrums for the mind. “ Conversion ”—pro-
fessed acceptance of certain theological notions
—can’t convert a damaged mentality into a
normal one. “ Finding salvation” isn’t finding
anew nervous system, and the grotesque mis-
conception of the alcoholic craving as some
kind of immoral appetite leads every intelligent
alcoholist to doubt whether the inebriate will
ever be successfully dealt vvitli by anybody who
has not himself suffered under the cruellest of
all tyrants like Herjeticv
Man’s Market Value.
?MMissioxER VValstab, of the Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works, has given his ultimatum on the mini-
mum wage question, and thinks that there has now
been enough said. “No man in (his country,” said the
s ige, “ is such a fool as to work for less than he is worth,
and it is against all ideas of liberty to insist that an em-
ployer shall pay more than he thinks the man he has hired
deserves ” : —
’Tis said, and never more let fools arise
To tell the old, old lie of Labor’s wrongs,
To irritate the wealthy and the wise
With fierce, discordant speech and din of
songs.
The toiler knows the worth of bone and thew
And blood and brain, and in the market he
Has sold them fairly for the guerdon due,
A little mutton and some bread and tea.
That which the master flings them, who has
fared
On what is best, the fairest fruits of earth,
Is by the sullen workers roughly shared —
Each wrests his portion and perceives his
worth.
Who brook the terrors of the murderous blast,
And daily cope with danger and disease,
Or up aloft upon the reeling mast
Invite the enmity of furious seas—
Who dare a hundred deaths in mine and mill,
And where the glowing iron mass is shred,
Where dizzy wheels and fiery forges fill
The curious stranger with a voiceless dread—
These have the price that they themselves have
fixed—
The price for which they wage a bitter strife—
Enough, perchance, to keep them poised
betwixt
A dread of death and carelessness of life.
The pale, gaunt widow at the swift machine,
Rapt in the wearing task she dare not shirk,
Upon whose drawn, despairing face is seen
The agony of never-ending work,
Has pain and squalor for her daily pay,
The moan of orphans, lovelessness and
dearth ;
And this, the snug, contented wage-lords say,
Is all a Hod-created creature’s worth !
According to our worth is our reward
Below. The big-jowled Boss, o’erfed with
meat
And flushed with wine, may tell his minted
hoard,
And hug his sides in hideous conceit.

H. M‘L. (H.): A dilution of last week’s page.. .A.E.:
Tub Bulletin believes in Protection to the point of
absolute prohibition where necessary. It also believes in
several things which apparently find little favor with the
parties that use the fiscal creeds for -personal purposes.
It believes, for instance, in the level-headed administra-
tion of justice, and is averse to making the Supreme
Court a stamping-ground for lawyers with Water Police
Court souls L. Adams: Once a Crown Prosecutor
always a Crown Prosecutor. Every lawyer, like every
other man, is a sportsman. And a detective is a sports-
man; he wants to hang his man. You can’t expect him
to have a judicial mind, especially as he has to pay for
information from thieves and scoundrels out of his own
miserable pittance, the State being too dull to see that a
detective on 15 shillings or so a day, minus expenses, is,
and must be, a menace to society. ..Eddy M. : Don’t
remember seeing him ...Mulga: Excellent. Will goon

Bulletin can see in N.S. W. Judge Windeyer’s giving one
burglar 10 years because he came from Victoria, and
another seven years only because he had no intei provincial
crime-record, is that the outside criminal—the man with
the interprovinoial record—gave the N.S.W. police more
trouble and had a longer run, because he was unknown

A correspondent : “ The view of Sydney
Harbor, which forms a screen in the N.S. VV. court
at the Imperial Institute, is not quite so bad as
Mr. Marks tries to make it appear. It was painted
by T. E. Ryan, the well-known scenic artist, from
a panoramic view lent by Agent-General Samuel,
and it gives a sufficiently good idea of the beauty
and magnitude of Port Jackson. Of course,
people who know the harbor well may find fault
with some of the details, but the intention was to
give a general idea only. Besides, what can you
expect for £25?”

“ Aunt Jack ” took Time by the forelock
at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday night, bub some-
how let go after the second act, and never
recovered its grip. The opening was full of pro-
mise, but the end was a solemn anti-climax,
vaguely suggestive of Napoleon breaking his neck
by falling over a commissariat mu'e on the night
before Marengo. The story contains two barris-
ters—one Jack’s nephew, who is secretly married
and is in dread of discovery, and the other the
counsel for defendant in Jack’s breach-of-promise
case, who proposes to her without knowing that
she is the plaintiff. The young barrister’s wife is
the niece of the defendant, and a lady who is mis-
taken for Aunt Jack is the defendant’s new mash
—a pork-widow from the Dibbs-cursed city of
Shikargo, and these parties all get mixed up with
a lord and a red-headed attorney, and fly round
very amusingly, but to no special purpose.
The defendant is mainly notable for the fact that
he whistles through his missing tooth when he
talks ; and’the red-headed attorney, despite the
fact that Dob Boucicault pub all his ability
into the part, is merely a kind of Aunt
Sally—a carrier of documents for his client,
and a faller over bags, and a rouse-
about generally. All the people suspect each
other of something that rests on no foundation
whatever, and refuse to go away till the matter is
explained. The pork-widow is hidden in a room,
no one seems to know why, and passed off as
Aunt Jack for no earthly reason. The parties get
confused in a hotel, and cheerfully eat each
other’s dinners in an unexplained fashion, and the
young barrister wants to dismember the old bar-
rister on exceedingly slender grounds. Finally,
the case comes into court, where it falls rather
flat, and Aunt Jack gets £d. damages. Nothing
is said about costs. Aunt Jack, however, sings a
song with a screaming chorus, and prods the
Judge with her brolly, and now and then comes
out to try and bruise the defendant therewith;
and her affianced husband, who is for the defen-
dant, throws up his brief repeatedly, and attempts
to run out of the court.
# * #
If someone could invent a respectable
climax “Aunt Jack” might be a really good
comedy; as it is it presents a rather sawn-off ap-
pearance. Mrs. Brough, as a very short-tempered
aunt with spectacles and an infuriated umbrella,
is a pleasant, upstanding relative, and one that any
nephew might be pleased to have in the house.
The only other parts worth speaking of are those
of Brough and Cecil Ward, as the two barristers,
and both are thoroughly satisfactory. The former,
in fact, is a lot more than satisfactory. Miss
Noble, however, is wasted as a pretty little wife
who has practically nothing to do, save be her own
attractive self; and Miss Temple, with an exagge-
rated Amurrikan accent, is a mere side issue; and
the elderly office-boy, and the person who blows
through his missing tooth, and the judge—who is
Titheradge, by the way, in the degradation of a
one-act part —are all persons who have no adequate
chance to develope themselves. Still, Dob Bouci-
cault’s return covers a multitude of sins, and
“ Aunt Jack ” will pass muster anywhere with
the present company. What it might be if played
by Plainbillolloway is a circumstance which is
more dreadful to think of than the kraken of
Bishop Pontoppidan,
* * * *
On Saturday “ The Second Mrs. Tan-
qneray ” will be staged at the Lyceum for a three-
night season. “ The Amazons ” will follow for
two nights, and on Friday Mrs. Brough will take
a benefit as “Niobe” prior to her departure for
England to enjoy her first genuine rest since the
B. and B. Co. was inaugurated. If there is not a
big attendance that night then there is no grati-
tude in the soul of man.

G. Rignold’s “Black-Eyed Susan” and
burlesque are keeping up their end of the log
successfully at Her Majesty’s. A number of
ladies with much musical capacity have been laid
on, and the chorus is even brighter than The Bul-
letin suspected it of being on the first night.
Altogether, “ Susan with Two Black Eyes ” may
pass muster as a respectable kind of comic opera
with legs in it, and some of the legs may be men-
tioned with enthusiasm as being above the
average.

Harry Rickards has got a valuable attrac-
tion at the Tivoli in the person of Miss Alma
Grey, aged four years or thereabouts, the infant
daughter of Alf. Boothman. This small spinster
is a dancing genius, and should grow up into
something remarkable unless her brillance evapor-
ates prematurely. A new farce called the “ In-
truder,” by Charles Faning, has caught on well,
and the clever jugglers from the Land of the
Chrysanthemum continue to dig up new tricks
from the recesses of their Japanese inner con-
sciousness, where they have resources that are
practically inexhaustible.
* * * *
The “Haunted Swing” is pursuing its
mysterious way at its old residence, in Pitt-street
Sydney, with the best results to the management
and others. The Swing is a bewildering illusion—
almost as bewildering as the balance-sheet of a
boom bank, or the lost Tichborne, or the person
who stole that long-forgotten mace ; and the per-
son who can get bewildered for 6d. may consider
himself obfuscated at a cheap rate. Woodloch’s
circus is still doing the suburbs, but about the
middle of next week it definitely vanishes over the
local horizon.
*■ * * *
Mr. Allan Hamilton, late of Woodloch’s
show, is about to strike out for himself with a
large Circus and Water Pantomime. Five huge
tents are in course of construction, and the other
fixtures, fittings and utensils are in active prepara-
tion. Hamilton’s Circus is to be an unusually
luxurious affair in its internal arrangements,
being fitted more after the manner of the dress-
circle of a theatre than the usual circus fashion.
The proprietor is a resourceful showman of vast
experience and with a capacity for making things
go under the most adverse circumstances. Also,
he is a large, robust, genial person of great chest
measurement, and eminently fitted to recapture
the circus lion when he escapes from the cage and
carry him back to his place of confinement by the
hair and tail.

“The Fatal Card,” by that now famous
young Australian, Haddon Chambers, is to be
staged on Saturday at Sydney Royal. The drama
will thus make a good staj-t in this country, for
Bland Holt’s strong company and magnificent
staging would even give some semblance of
success to a log in three acts. The 00., by the
way, has been further strengthened for this
especial occasion, so if, by any chance, the “Fatal
Card ” should fail, it will have every chance to
fail in a large and gorgeous fashion.
* * * *
G. R. Sims’ new play has failed unduly at
Melbourne Bijou, and Miss Amy Roselle is at
present displaying a large amount of talent to very
little business-purpose. “A Wife’s Ordeal” is
well worth seeing by everyone who discriminates
between dramatic literature and circuses. It has
a thoughtful plot, worked out by real flesh-and-
blood creations. There is bold truth in its argu-
ment that nothing may be impossible to an affec-
tionate woman who has surprised her husband in
the act of pointing a pistol at his weak heart.
And, although the immoral ideal may offend
shallow notions of decency in regard to “the
young person,” there is no reason why other
persons shouldn’t take the entertainment on its
merits. The ingenious, but unacceptable, ending
of this vivid story has something to do with the
naked appearance of the Bijou benches. Don
Juan Daore changes his spots too abruptly. Hav-
ing found grace, like Paul on the road to Damas-
cus, he presumes upon his new-laid Christianity in
declaring pure and sparkling love for the sister
of the married woman he was anxious to embrace
only five minutes before. Author Sims took pains
to make many unusual things seem probable in
this ambitious play, but he didn’t, and couldn’t,
lead one to believe that the heroine will gladly
accept her reformed admirer as a brother-in-law.
In which connection the flabby husband is like-
wise supposed to have feelings of his own, although
Frank Cates affords no clue to their whereabouts.
“ Esther Sandraz,” by Sydney Grundy, will be
staged on Saturday. The name-part was spoken
of as Miss Roselle’s best when she created it in
London, and the performance ought to command
a little kind attention for the sake of art and soul.

Cinderella ” will run until Tuesday of
next week at the Princess’s, a farewell benefit to
Horace Wheatley being announced for Wednes-
day, when his friend, MTntyre, is seemingly
going to appear in person. The rival cricketing
teams and suite have promised to attend the
theatre in state this (Thursday) evening. The
suite includes the office-bearers and plain, ordinary
members of the V.C.A.; also, rumor whispers that
the scorers, umpires, and M.C.C. ground-rollers
may be induced to attend. “Cinderella” is
doing very well, all things considered. Called
an extravaganza, it is practically a variety
show sandwiched between two dry slices of panto-
mime, and the general public merely prefer it to a
former production of a similar character. James
Norrie’s dress-suit, the skating man’s frock-coat,
and other matters, are quite inconsistent with
extravaganza. By the way, the “Cinderella”
which Oscar Barrett has made money with in
England —last year at Irving’s Lyceum and this
year at Birmingham—is an elegant pantomime, a
serio-comic poem. In this new scheme of Xmas
show the swallow-tailed warbler finds no place,
and would seem as de trop as a tramcar in the
world to come.

Harry Rickards, George Wood, the musi-
cal Leslies, and the usual “host of talent” are
keeping business very lively at the Opera House.
Memories of the appalling Yarmouth are revived
and blotted out every evening by Miss Ada
Delroy, whose serpentine dance is something more
than a lordly flourish of two sticks. Even the
lady’s magic-lantern effects are superior to Yar-
mouth’s, despite his noble birth, so The Bulle-
tin hopes that the eclipsed son of a marquis will
use his serpentine robe from Paris as a winding-
sheet and bury the dead past with a stake through
its middle.

A Haunted Swing, under M‘Mahon man-
agement, is urging its wild career in a commodious
building near the top end of Bourke-st., Melb.
The strange device is said to be growing on the
public in general, and ladies in particular. It
affects them in much the same way as a taste for
drink. After taking one “go” of swing they
rush away, in some cases, to buy another ticket,
and are. loth to tear themselves away from the
dissipation at closing time.

Melb. Royal opens again to-night (Thurs-
day) with a Grand Combination Entertainment,
in honor of what Mr. Geo. Coppin calls Gala
Week. The entertainment is constructed on the
strictest gala principles, and concludes with a
harlequinade or a short ballad concert, unless the
curtain descends upon a transformation scene or
an amateur brass band. The programme is not
explicit on this point.

Melbourne University Conservatorium of
Music has been organised with a splendid staff.
Prof, Marshall Hall will himself teach theory,
and will aid Madame Elise Wiedennann, a pupil
of Marchesi. Cathedral-organist Ernest Wood
takes the organ ; W. A. Laver, of the Frankfort
Conservatorium, the piano ; Franz Dierich, of the
Richter Orchestra, has charge of the violin ; while
Hattenbaeh, of Leipsic Conservatorium, looks
after the ’cello. Other instruments are taken by
such well-known orchestral-players as Ceschina,
Liittich, Lyons, Ruhr, Sinnotte, W. T. Barker,
and Herbert and Harry Stoneham. Elocution is
in charge of that successful teacher, T. A. Sisley.
Business begins 28th Feb.

Westmacott and the brother of Plain Bill
put in a fortnight at Hobart with a tri-weekly
change of bill— or, rather, programme, for Bill,
alas ! never changes. As Bill is not relevant to
this paragraph, it is well to say that brother Charles
doesn’t change either. All the same, O. Hol-
loway—who was almost strong occasionally,in that
blood-stained drama, “The King of Crime”—
Westmacott, and good old Oathcart are more
than able to prevent the audience throwing their
boots at the other male members of the company—
a fate which most of them richly deserve. Still,
the painful fact remains that Albert Marsh is the
only man we have yet seen who has a right to
play the principal gory character in this gory
drama ; and everyone else who attempts it is only
a new evidence of this. As for the principal low
comedian—well, in him the writer has discovered
the depression. Despite these things, and the
powerful opposition of something in the shape of
a circus, the Exhibition, and nightly society
functions at Gormanston’s, the Holloway and
Westmacott Co. did good business. A succeeding
week at Launceston was even better.
At Poverty Point .
“King Arthur,” at the Lyceum (writes The Bulletin's
London correspondent), is not a success dramatically.
Superbly staged and dressed, of course, it is, and as a
mise en seine has not been surpassed by anything hitherto
done at the historic house. But there is too little acting
and too much talkee-talkee. Comyns Oarr evidently
thought that he had an opportunity, not lightly to be
missed, of proving that there are amongst moderns some
(or one) not inferior in the art of writing blank
verse to the giants of the golden age of Queen Bess ; but
though he undoubtedly possesses good gifts in that direc-
tion, he is still a long way from Shakespeare. Irving is
ludicrously unfitted for the part of King Arthur. How
shall I describe his appearance? Shall I convey my mean-
ing if I say he is a compound of Richelieu, Becket, and an
ascetic High-Church parson? You would never imagine
that such a poor-looking, thin-legged creature could
have commanded those doughty knights whose deeds
Tennyson has pictured and immortalised. Forbes
Robertson is no lusty lover of his king’s wife, but
a poor Piccadilly masher mountebanking in a bor-
row'ed suit of mail at a Oovent Garden fancy ball.
The fair Ellen has few opportunities of displaying
the charm of her exquisite voice, though, of course, she
could not but play to perfection the part of a faithless
wife. Coming on in one scene at the head of her bevy of
maidens, she irresistibly reminded one of a Sunday-school
teacher leading her class of girls, and ready to call upon
them to “ sing the next hymn—now altogether, mind, and
in tune.” Modred is a poor, vulgar villain, who should
have been kicked downstairs at the first opportunity.
And so on, and so on. The critics the first night met, as
is their custom on first nights, in the smoking-room after
the act to compare notes-for there is no originality
amongst them—and they one and all agreed that the
play was damnable ; but, gadsooks! the next morning the
papers appeared and the worst of them merely damned
with faint praise. But let the truth be told—“ King
Arthur ” is a shade worse than “ King Lear" at the
Lyceum.
Melbournian : “ Going to the Dacres, the second night,
I found less than half a house. Such a bad play, so
thoroughly unconvincing ! The players got a hand now
and again for their undoubted skill, but every curtain
came down flat. Why should an excellent actress not
open in one of her familiar parts, stamped with approval
round England ? All to oblige Mr. Sims, who ought to
have handed his plot to Pinero.”
The gold-mine, “ Charley’s Aunt,” still yields wealth.
I met Penley yesterday at “my grandmother’s house,”
(says The Bulletin’s London correspondent by last mail),
and he told me that he has not yet commenced even to
think of a provincial tour.
Haddon Chambers’ fees for the short six weeks’ run of
“ John-a-Dreams ” amounted to just £lOOO.
It seems probable that Henry Irving will visit Australia
in 1896. No great spectacular productions, says Dion
Boucicault, are possible ; but you may see him with his
own company in “The Bells,” “Olivia,” and many other
plays of like calibre. The Bulletin is glad to hear it.
Irving is at his best without much setting. He can never
thrill you half as much as when be stands up in a dress-
suit and freezes your marrow with “The Dream of
Eugene Aram.” See him as Matthias in “The Bells,”
and as the Vicar of Wakefield, and then, if you don’t want
to spoil your memory of the great man, never go and see
him any more.
Dion Boucicault re Mrs. Patrick Campbell“ I saw
Mrs. Campbell as Kate Cloud in ‘ John-it-Dreams,’ Haddon
Chambers’ new play. I was not at all impressed with
her. An indifferent actress, with a strong personality,
and a charming face—the appearance and style that
compel you to look at her. But she has no technique,
and lacking the can ful instiuction Pinero would give her
for ‘ The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,’ her performance was
anything but remaikable.” Mr. Boucicault says of Mrs.
John Wood :—“ She is inimitable—the best low comedian
in London, and a host in herself. She ought to come out
here, only our people don’t seem to know her name. First
of all, you explain that you do not mean Essie Jenyns,
and then they retort * Why, of course riot. You mean the
woman who wrote ‘ East Lynne.’ Painful, isn’t it? ”
Coppin has found a felicitous title for his feminine leg-
show at Melb. Royal—the “Great Combination Enter-
tainment.”
Melbourne theatrically just now shows that variety
is the spice of life. Four out of the six houses are
occupied by variety co.’s, and the Princess’s is virtually
turned into a music-hall by the numerous unmistakeable
“turns” given by three of Rickards’ “loans.” The
legitimate shows up at the Bijou only.
Amy Roselle has the Bernhardt trick of stowing away
handkerchiefs all over the stage on hot nights. Where-
ever she may chance to be standing a fresh rnouchoir
comes to light with the unexpected alacrity of a Ma-
hatma’s letter. The “gods,” having tumbled to it by
now, are keenly watchful, and hail a new “ find ” with
approving murmurs.
Wybert Reeve, in a letter to the Argus, tells the Melb.
public that they will have only themselves to blame if
Williamson and Musgrove should fall back upon a lower
i .m.iper style of theatrical entertainment at the
Princess*.
Amy R iselle’s voice is sweet and tender when occasion
requires, and never harsh. Its forte is in the expression
of strength of purpose, or deep emotion, without resort-
ingto conventional elocution tricks. Roselle often mightbe
Jennie Lee speaking, their voices are so much alike in
quality and intelligence. Little Jennie has only acted
one part for all she was worth, more’s the pity; but in
any other character, which she was scarcely troubling to
act at all, she couldn’t rattle off six lines of fustian senti-
ment without betraying her genius for suiting the accent
to the word. Actresses and actors don’t breathe feelii g
into their words, ns a rule. They lay it on with a trowel,
seldom laying on the right quantity, and not infrequently
using the wrong kind of “feeling.”
Lord Yarmouth had a box for the ilrst Dacre perfor-
mance at Melb. Bijou. Miss Kathrine Hardy, and the
dreadful amateur lady who supports Yarmouth in “ A
Pair of Lunatics,” sat well to the fore, but the show place,
the corner facing the audience, was filled by Buckley,
jun. He looked just full of bliss.
There is some unpleasantness concerning the statement
of accounts in connection with the three benefit nights
recently given by Bloater Yarmouth at Melb. Bijou. A
clear balance-sheet is called for.
J. C. Williamson saw Miss Kathrine Hardy in “The
Judge” at Melb. Bijou, and straightway engaged her for
the comedy season at the Princess’s. This young actress
has a nice taste in stage-color. In “The Foundling” she
wore a dress with fittings and etceteras in brilliant poppy
scarlet of the same color as the lamp-shades used on the
stage. The effect was one to delight an impressionist
artist.
How they do drift from concert platform to music-hall:
Isabel Webster, Marie Elster, Leslie Norman, Tasim
Sherwin, Syria Lament, Evelyn Haite, Jules Snmnsen,
P. C. Josephs.
One strong factor in the success of “ Aladdin,” at Melb.
Royal, was that Steele Robertson supplied new local
verses nightly, always bringing the show abreast of local
doings up to 7 o’clock each evening. So the show was
literally “up to date,” as advertised. One duet had by
the close of the show no less than 39 verses.
Florrie Stuart-Gleeson, who has been playing small
parts, in Melbourne, for the last couple of years, appears
to be a coming star. She is young (still in her teens),
pretty, acts intelligently, and dances very gracefully.
A better class of descriptive song than some recent im-
portations from London ’alls is “The Message of the
Wires,” written and composed in Melbourne by Bernard
Espinasse and George Pack. They got Maggie Moore to
sing it in the Royal panto., and she made it go well. The
words are rational and the refrain distinctly fetching.
Thespians may be grateful for a- hint that Wybert
Reeve’s “Recollections ” are out, in a handy vol.
Dacre insisted on opening with “A Wife’s Ordeal,”

Dear Bulletin,— G. R. Sims, in his play “A Wife’s
Ordeal,’’ produced at Melb. Bijou for the first lime on
any stage, appears as a disciple of the Ibsen he was wont
to abuse. He wouldn’t for shame put it on in London,
where his fine contempt for the hairy Scandinavian is well
remembered. Sims’ Nora is overwhelmed at the thought
of the shame that will fall upon her and hers should the
knowledge of her hubby’s little embezzlement become
known. Her children—her dear, innocent babes must be
saved this disgrace ; and how ? Their mother must go to
the wicked millionaire, and put her charms up for auction,
vith a £5OOO reserve. The wealthy rou6 is a gentleman
vho brags about his conquests, too, and wears an habitual
sneer indicative of his opinion that “all women are alike.”
Nora’s babes must never be reproached as the children of
an embezzler (an eminently genteel villainy, embezzle-
ment, by the way) but they may be known as the offspring
of a prostitute. Sims seems to have remembered that
only the sins of the fathers are visited on the children.—

Bishop Doyle, of Lismore (N.S.W.), has
toured N.Q. to study the sugar-cane disease called
“gumming,” and is now busy showing tin-
planters in his diocese how to make money from
their crops. Father Curran is out Wyalong way
instructing the diggers how to find and raise tin-
precious metals, and the Rev. Mr. Campbell is
publicly lecturing on the cheapest and quickest
way of getting a fistful of gold. Proofs positive

Mr. Percy Spence, the well-known Aus-
tralian artist, whose name is familiar to all Bul-
letin readers, is turning his steps towards Europe,
where all capable Australians go. As an example
of the curse of being a “ colony ” and hanging on
to the tail-end of a distant metropolis, this con-
stant exit of the brainiest section of young Aus-
tralia is worth thinking over, and is a legitimate
subject for execration. Nine excellent paintings
by Mr. Spence—valued from .£l5O downwards—
are to be disposed of by art-union, and for ss.
anyone may have a chance of securing a high
class work of art which will be an ornament to
his home and an important asset, and which will
probably increase rather than dimmish in value
as time goes by. The prizes are on view at Cal-
lan’s, 318 George-street, Sydney, where one may
satisfy himself as to their quality ; tickets may be
obtained there, or from Mr. Spence, Paling’s
Buildings, or from Mr. A. J. Daplyn, 187 Casth -
reagh-street; and the drawing takes place on
April 10. Winning numbers will be published in
the morning papers of April 11.
Mr. T. A. Ooghlan, N.S.W. Government
Statistician, issues a new volume called the
“Statistical Survey of N.S.W.” for 1893-94. It
is an embodiment of all the statistical infor-
mation concerning the province contained in
other official works, but largely added to and
brought up to date.. The two most striking
features about this volume are its exceeding clear-
ness and maivellous condensation. The works-
issued by the N.S.W. Statistical office have always-
been remarkable for the amount of information
supplied, and the manner in which that informa
tion is compressed into the least possible space,
and the office is improving still further in this
respect. In the matter of condensation evm
Hay ter takes second place, that eminent authority
having a tendency to be needlessly diffuse, while
the Maoriland official year-book may be quoted ; s
a publication which verges on the garrulous.
Among the various seats of learning in
Australia the Melbourne University High School
occupies a leading place. The buildings am
very handsome and commodious, and stand on a
section of the University reserve. The accommo-
dation for boarders is unrivalled, both as regards
quality and extent; and the numerous studies are
ideal in the comfort of their appointments. There
is a large staff of expert teachers, and the Prin-
cipal (Mr. Thomas Palmer, M.A., LL.B.) takes a
very active part in the work of the school. In
November last no fewer than 19 of the pupils
matriculated, and 12 honors were won. Mr.
Palmer is a Victorian by birth and education,
fully conversant with all the conditions of Aus-
tralian life, and possesses the highest mental,
moral, and common-sense qualifications to impart
a sound, practical education to the youth of this
country, and to turn them out well-equipped for
the battle of life under any conditions. For the
sons of merchants, professional men, or pastoral
ists, it would be hard to find a place presenting
more possibilities of mental and physical growth.

The auditors of the false balance-sheet of a
Brisbane church, which omitted to account for £2OO
stolen by a pious official, explained that they didn’t see
the bank-book, and went through the accounts hurriedly,
and only certified “ E. and O.E.”—consequently they
didn't think they were to blame for the trouble. Why
hasn’t this splendid idea been struck before T What a lot
of nasty remarks Melb. auditors might have saved them-
selves by a casual “ E. and 0.E.” above their highly-
tespectable signatures j
Most of the fire-insurance companies whose
balance-sheets are to hand have got through the year
remarkably well, considering the extraordinary com-
bustibleness of things in bad times. The Victoria Insur-
ance 00. has made a profit of £7172, and after paying its
usual div. of 2s. per share has £5OO more in hand than at
the commencement of the year. Its paid-up capital is
£50,000, and reserves £90,000. The Victoria General has
earned about £1220 during the year, and carries this
little amount forw'ard. The latter co. is a small concern
of recent date, which needs time to acquire a firm footing.
The Southern Insurance co. has earned a profit of £5364
(£l4OO more than last year), and after paying a beautiful
15 per cent. div. is still £l6OO to the good. Its reserves
now total £84,000. The City Mutual of Sydney pays a
10 per cent, div., and £3OOO to reserve. The Mer-
cantile Mutual, also of Sydney, made a clear profit
tor the year of £11,571, and pays its usual div. of 6d. a
share with a bonus of 10 per cent, to insurers and another
bonus to shareholders. The Farmers’ Co-operative In-
surance 00., of Canterbury (M.L.), with a premium income
of only £3122, has contrived to make a profit of £4300,
mostly from interest on investments. It pays 6 per cent,
to shareholders, and 10 per cent, to insurers, and adds
£lOOO to reserve. A 00. whose profits are more than its
total premium income is a splendid anomaly, and it seems
a pity there aren’t more of the same sort in existence.
The Indemnity Fire and Marine Co. has paid an interim
div. of 8 per cent. The Mutual Union of Hobart pays a 7
per cent. div. mostly out of interest, the profit on the in-
surance business for the year being only £4o2—just about
one-fifth of the amount realised in ’93.
* * * *
The City Mutual Life Society’s balance-sheet
for ’94 is better than its predecessor in several respects,
while in at least one instance it is a good deal worse. The
new business is larger, and the society has saved and
added to its funds £13,000 out of a total income of
£34,000, whereas in ’93 it saved only £lo,oooout of a total
of £32,600. This is a great improvement, and it would
have been still greater but for a depressing item of £lBOl
for law-expenses in connection with a suit forced upon the
society. The interest received from investments still
keeps above the average (though it has fallen in
two years from 7J to 5i per cent., which is a
serious drop), and this item more than covers
the death-claims for the year—a result attained by only a
few other offices. Also, it almost covers the total claims
from deaths and maturity of endowments—a result
attained by still fewer. The death-claims, endowment-
claims and surrenders are all much less than they were
last year. The outstanding premiums are very small.
Also the City Mutual’s funds are lent out on mortgage
under the same conditions as those of the Maoriland
State Loan Department, principal and interest being both
repayable by instalments, and this steady diminution of
the amount advanced on each security helps materially to
protect the society from loss in case of a serious fall in
property values. The only item among its assets to which
exception can be taken is that which reads “ Deferred
instalments of Annual Premiums, £6782.” This is appa-
rently arrived at by assuming—in cases where premiums
are payable quarterly or half-yearly—the other six or nine
months’ premiums required to make up the year’s pay-
ment as an asset. And considering that the insured may
abandon his policy at any time, in which case the “de-
terred instalments ” immediately vanish, this requires
a lot of hard thinking over. Only one of the seven big life
offices follows this system.
The worst feature about the City Mutual
■is its expenses. This year they amount to 28 per cent, of
•the total income, or, including the industrial branch, to
29 per cent., without taking into account such items as
“ Furniture account written off,” or “ Loss in realisation
.of assets.” Reckoning these in, the expenses are no less
than 30 per cent, of the total income, and including the
unlucky law costs they reach 35 per cent. Leaving
out the law expenses, however, as an item not
likely to recur, the total is practically the same as
last year. It was then generally understood that ’94
■would show a considerable reduction, but, so far, the
■reduction has failed to appear. The heavy outlay is
accounted for, to some extent, by the very large
proportion of new business, but even renewal busi-
ness has cost over 25 per cent, of the actual premiums,
which is a heavier rale by a good many per cent, than
several of the large offices of Australasia pay on their
new and renewal business combined. The only cheap
item seems to be the small industrial connection, which is
conducted at a charge of 53 per cent., whereas another
industrial office “blews” say 70 per cent, undef this
heading, The board promises, however, to bring its
total expense-rate down to 20 per cent., and Tub
Bulletin cordially hopes to see it set about doing so at
once.

The Victorian Government has decided to
reduce interest on Govt. Savings Bank deposits from the
miserable 3 per cent, to a still more miserable 2j on small
sums and 2 per cent, on larger ones. The reason assigned
is that the Treasury “can’t profitably employ the
money,” and therefore wants to discourage de-
positors. A much more probable reason is that the
Treasury wants to drive depositors back to the recon-
structed banks, one or two of which want cheap money
badly if they are to meet their first batch of creditors
with anything like success. Victorian long-dated
Government stock can be bought up, in London, at prices
which will yield £3 125., or rather more, per cent., and if
that isn’t a profitable investment of money borrowed
from the public at 3 per cent., it certainly looks like one.
This attempt to discourage the poor investor from getting
his savings locked up under Govt, guarantee is a mean
• and shabby device.

Ediior Bulletin, —Re “ Vosnibara’s ” letter on
trade-protection societies. As the usual credit is a four-
months’ bill, three months would not test a t.p.s. report.
Even if the credit were 30 days, by ringing the changes on
his merchants, once started by a good report, a clever
trader could incur heavy liabilities and run a year or two
at least. The t.p.s. system is unsound. A man is good
for £5O, and to all inquiries this reply is given, so if the
man be industrious in looking round for credit, he gets
into a dozen merchants—result, £6OO credit on a £5O re-
commendation. Now that wholesale stocks are hare and
turnover to meet coming bills not a necessity, houses are
more conservative, and demand a financial statement from
retailers, and the above system is brought to light. On
the boom collapse, banks and traders, in their struggle to
get out of bad things, were giving one another incorrect
information on reference, so that they oast about in all
directions for financial evidence, but placed full c mfldence
in no particular testimony. They have concluded that if
business submitted cannot be proved undoubted in their
office without going outside, it is best passed. As “ Vos-
nibara” states there are three reliable societies in
Melbourne, it follows that many must be otherwise,
for at least a dozen exist sufficient reason, I think, for
avoiding the whole of the fraternity. Canvassers, paid by
com., have worked Melb. and suburbs thoroughly, and
enrolled subscribers irrespective of anything but netting
their com.—though I don’t say this applies to all the
societies. The majority of subscribers cannot afford to
be without the writ and other lists issued, but the
societies' usefulness in other respects is on the whole
rapidly departing.—J.B.C.

Chief-Justice Madden, in deciding the case of
Albert Goodwin, a Caledonian Land Bank shareholder
who desired to be relieved of his liability, talked in a most
irreverent manner of the dead institution. The Cale-
donian was founded chiefly by David Munro, and a lot of
the shares were sold among his .own employes, the object
being—so it was effusively announc'd to give them a
chance Of panioipating in a profitable speculation.
Apparently the only business of importance it ever did
was buying land from David Munro ; its only consider-
able assets now are Munro’s land ; and its liabilities
consist of the P.N.’s given to Munro in payment
thereof. “ From the evidence,” said C.-J. Madden, as
reported in the Agb, “ the whole thing was a scheme
to sell Munro’s property at a very large price to these
people—a mean-spirited scheme by wliieh the burden
of this purchase would be thrown on a number of
apparently simple-minded working-men.” The C.J. also
remarked that the prospectus was in a most important
respect absolutely false, and used the word “mis-
representation” in a free and irreverent fashion,
and wound up by discharging Goodwin from his liability
on various grounds, most of them of an unpleasant
character. It is gratifying to notice that Melbourne is
gradually losing its respect for its big boomers, nowadays.
A year ago, the law might have respectfully apologised
to David Munro for stirring up the disagreeable incident
in any way, and might have glared at the m i i who didn’t
respect the misfortunes of that fallen potentate.

Ed. Bulletin,—iJe inflated W. A. mines and the
British public, how is this for high? Five or six years
ago, a N.S.W. mine was sent to me in London to put
on the market. I put it on. Original cost was
£lO,OOO (a lot too much). The trio who sent it tome
were to have £3o,ooo(cass/t if possible, of course); work-
ing capital, £25,000. I put it on with a capital of
£350,000, and asked the public for a first issue of
£300,000 1! 1 Where was the balance to go ? Well, after
providing for about £55,000 for certain blackmailers
(most of the London financial and a lot of the other papers
are “ mailers ” of the deepest dye), the London promoter
and I w'ere to collar the balance (or £90,000 apiece). It
would not have been bad biz. had it come off. Some
£9OOO odd was applied for, and the directors actually
went to allotment, but one of them kicked up a row (he
wasn’t subsidised so heavily as the rest), and the direc-
tors met the shareholders and asked them if they would
go on with the £9OOO odd and develope the mine, or have
their money back in full ? They were not absolute idiots,
and took their money back. If you like, I could give
you the names of the three directors, two of whom, to
my knowledge, have since filed their schedules, and one
of whom is, I think, judging from your wild-cat column,
still working the little game.—Jabbz.

affected that year—rising only from 156,870 to 179,2880 z.

N.S. W. has cut a dowdy figure in the Australian gold
statistics. In a single year, however, the output has
sprung upward 145,5000 z. ! W.A., the sensational, put
on a spurt of less than 100,000 oz. In plain figures: For
1894, N.S.W. produced 324,7870 z. of gold, of the value of

Electricity is now used for working the Eleanora
mine, Hillgrove (N.S. W.). The electricity is supplied by
the Hillgrove and Armidale Water-power Electric Co.,
which utilises the waters of the Guyra River, to generate
motive-power which is supplied to the mine at a rate of
about £B2 per horse-power per annum. About 100 h.p
is thus rented. It is computed that steam cost the
Eleanora just about £6O per annum per h.p., so that
working by electricity means an immense saving. The
Baker’s Creek, Sunlight, and other local mines, will also
be supplied with electricity shortly, both for power and
lighting. This is the first time electrical power has been
applied to mining machinery in Australia, and also the
first occasion on which it has been generated direct from

N.Z. Herald has been interviewing some re-

golden desert. Says one, speaking of the mortality :
“ You cannot get the name of a man if he dies in the
hospital there ; they have to bury the unfortunate fellows
as soon as the breath is out of their body. A man dies at
Coolgardie, he is just put in a rough packing-case, nailed
up, and put in a trench 3ft. 6in. deep. Maorilanders
cannot stand the climate at all, although fine, big men ;
Bananalanders pull through the best.” As for the reefs:
“ One co. has been floated in London for nearly £lOO,OOO.
I worked in that claim for six weeks and saw no sign of
gold with the exception of the rich leader they got at
first. Publicans are the people who are making the
harvest. I know two or three who are taking from £5OO

Proprietary General-manager Stewart has para-
lysed mine-bossdom at Broken Hill by the initiation of a
crusade against the use of curses in addressing workmen.
Already, they say, the development of a new vocabulary
of expletive is in progress. They now sigh at the Hill
for the days of the vigorous Patton, or even Howell, who
never personally used bullockese, but was tolerant.
The Proprietary is experiencing more trouble
from subsidences at Block 11. Over a year ago two men
were buried by the collapse of the bottom of a quarry
which had been pushed down in the ironstone
in advance of the rest of the open cut, and one of the
bodies has not yet been recovered. The general level of
the open out has long since reached the original level of
the quarry where the accident occurred, but the body has
evidently been carried further down. The present dis-
turbances are centred in the same spot.
Chaffey Baker, after a long truce, comes out on
top in the controversy with his fellow-directors of the
Central (8.H.) Co. on their policy of selling the output of
the mine to the Dry Creek Smelting Co. After six months’
trial of smelting at the mine with one furnace the
directors have decided that home smelling has it, and
have blown in a second furnace and suspended the export
of smelting ores altogether.
Some day somebody will make a big fortune by
treating the sulphide concentrator tailings at Broken Hill

Queensland. The 1 North Phoenix, under his charge, was
the show mine of the field, and he had escorted hun-
dreds of visitors through the workings without mishap.
His sudden death will be regretted by miners all over
Australasia.

The Lake View (Hannan’s) people are not pick-
ing their ore, but have two good shoots at 50ft. The
formation is mullocky slate schist with quartz stringers

be rich.

Bayley’s shallow-workings have commenced to

The Wealth of Nations is not dead. One
prominent politician and shareholder has declared in
Coolgardie that, despite all, it is a big mine, and 2000 oz.
will come in from it shortly. One of the local papers also
says that Col. North’s representative has signed up and that
the Wealth will be placed on the market shortly.

The locality of the latest Q. rush is about a mile

Fortune of War (Cue) report : “The best team
on the road has taken the portable engine from
Mullewa.” The shareholders will be pleased. The mine
is evidently a very middling affair, but never mind—the
best team is hitched to that engine. A portable engine,
too, is a sad blunder on any mine in Westralia where
the water is salt and otherwise heavily mineralised. But
a little mistake like that is nothing. The best team on
the road is hitched to that engine.
Bayley’s No. 1 South has ceaaed crushing
because of the enormous expense involved in running the
battery with a portable engine, to drive which fresh
water is essential. Salt water such as you get at Oool-
gardie plays the devil with all boilers, but cannot be
used at all with portables; therefore, those
for sending portable engines to Coolgardie should also be
responsible for the water to feed them.

Six months ago you could not walk out at Coolgar-
die at night withoui stumbling over a Rothschild's repre-
sentative. Rothschild has now retired in favor of Col.
North. About half the new mines and a great many of
the old ones are under offer to him, and his representa-
tives are all over the place, and you get to know it when
they are very drunk.

The Otis crusher has proved very successful in
treating West Australian ores. The Mill at Francis’ Re-
ward, Murchison, has crashed several thousand tons of
ores from the surrounding mines, and the average returns
are considerably higher than from similar ores treated by
stamper battery. Hence the Otis Mill is in high favor
with all the leaseholders, and is regularly rushed with
quartz. The chief points making for such phenomenal
success in the Mill may be attributed to the finer and
more even crushing secured by this process, as well as to
the comparative absence of sluices. The Otis crusher alsi
continues to give complete satisfaction at the Broken Hill
Proprietary mine, and at the Mount Morgan gold-mine.
Also, the Yalgogrin Public Crushing Company, of New
South Wales, report that their Otis Mill is given prefer-
ence to over the stamper battery by the leaseholders—in
controvertible evidence that the Mill is doing the best
work, a test which must inevitably tell in the long run.*
The B. R. Wise section of the “great
N.S.W. Freetrade-party ” are now yelling out
loud at Premier Reid for details of his policy—ii
he has any—and are telling him to “put up oi
shut up.”
The Archbishop of Canterbury’s famous
Ananias about the increase of crime in Victoria
under the secular education system is only Parson
Savage’s oft - repeated tale dished up afresh.
How it reached Benson’s ear isn’t known,
but presumably some parson sent it along and
hadn’t the common honesty to send with it the
figures, published in The Bulletin months ago,
which demonstrated that the story was either
ignorance, or wilful perversion, or a good deal of
both. The average parson, when his pet theory is
assailed, has no more conscience than an aboriginal.
Concerning a paragraph which appeared in
a recent issue as to certain spielers and ladies of the
gold-washed sort said to have accompanied a recent
Maoriland West Coast excursion, Mr, Jackson, of
the Union S.S. Co., has demonstrated, by a large
mass of reliable evidence, that company of this
sort is absolutely impossible on the Union
boats owing to the close supervision exer-
cised, and the extreme precautions taken in all
departments. The Bulletin had no intention of
reflecting on the U.S.S. Co., and, since the para
graph has been assumed to hear that interpreta-
tion, it regrets its appearance. The Union Co.’s
exeursions are conduced on a lavish and magnifi-
cent scale, and are now one of the great attractions
of the province as a tourist resort, and, so far as
this paper can learn, their management is unex
ceptiona.ble.

Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
certain relief.
FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and im-
purities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic pur-
gative, but operate by perfectly natural means, by
stimulating the liver and increasing the flow ol
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on the
outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sincerest
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and address of
F. M. Clements, Newtown, Sydney.
THE MODEL POLITICAL CANDIDATE.
First make sure thart the candidate you wish to
support is honest. Then that he is capable. Next
that he has some desire beyond that to serve his
own interests. If he passes this short examina-
tion satisfactorily, vote for him. But also make
sure that the candidate sails under his true colors.
If he is what he pretends to be, look out for his
trade-mark in the same manner as you would look
out for Frossard’s trade-mark on their packets of
Cavour cigars. It is always most aggravating to
find that one has voted for the wrong man, and
it is not less so to have paid a shilling for an
article that is not the genuine one, when, for the
same price, you can get eight light smokes of
splendid value. Frossard’s Cavour cigars are
mild, aromatic, and the best in the market. Once
tried, always liked.
Personal Items.
Victorian detective Considine lias, in all,
bagged nine murderers.
G. Hi- Reid has only held one court brief
since he became N.S.W.' Premier.
An English baroness was last week added
to the roll of resident Sydney pen-women.
Jack Rae, the crack Maoriland cross-
country rider, and Arthur Rae, the ex-N.S.W.
legislator, are brothers.
The Lieutenant-Governors of Queensland,
N.S. Wales, and Victoria—Palmer, Darley and
Madden—are Irishmen and knights.
Sam. Bennett, father of Alfred, who now
throws off journalistic harness, was the guiding
spirit of the first Australian Freetrade League.
The mother of the Westralian Legislative
brothers Forrest—a Scotch lady and a colonist of
52 years’ standing—has died at Bunbury, W.A..
aged 72. ’
Shortly before his death, Professor Hearn,
of Melb. University, showed a friend a publisher’s
cheque (£5) just to hand, the first profit from any
of his books.
George Coppin’s first Australian appear-
ance was in Sydney in 1843, but his first on any
stage was in ’36. The old man is now on the
verge of 76.
The house at Brighton (S.A.), occupied by
the poet Adam Lindsay Gordon when he repre-
sented the district of Victoria in S.A. Assembly,
is now being pulled down.
They say that a late Southern bank-mag-
nate drank two bottles of brandy daily. His
doctor objecting, he changed it to four bottles of
port—and got there all the same.
A Tichborne claimant has arisen in Ade-
laide, and intends shortly to “put in his claim.”
He is evidently being run by the Adelaide papers,
as this is the cauliflower-season.
John Douglas, now of Thursday Island,
was the first to legislatively propose the Separa-
tion of Queensland. He was then member for
Port Curtis, and introduced a bill dividing the
vast territory into three parts.
Another Western identity has departed in
the person of Mrs. James Arthur, aged 85 years,
who went to Bathurst in the old days of the
System—over half-a-century ago. Her husband
died a few years since, aged 90 years.
Subscriptions are not coming in freely to
the Adelaide fund for securing a picture of Lord
Kintore, who has promised to sit to a portrait-
painter after his return to England. “ Society ”

Gov. Duff, the false report of whose death
had a two hours’ run last week, has frequently of
late expressed a strong desire to re-enter the Com-
mons and a determination to do so as soon as he
can relieve himself of present responsibilities.
An accused person, acquitted by a jury
and discharged by a judge, who added, “Count
yourself lucky,” declares he said, sufficiently loud

Auarchist.
It is a solemn fact that a Melbourne capi-
talist—a South Yarra man—on being asked by
a lady for a subscription to a charitv, excused
himself on the ground that “things are so bad.
Indeed, I have <£20,000 lying idle, for I cannot
find an investment presenting adequate security! ”
Colonel Fox, Maoriland’s ostensible Com-
mander-in-Chief—publican and Premier Seddon
being the real Field-Marshal—has just married a
daughter of Capt. Russell, leader of M.L. Oppo-
sition. Fox, an ex-imperial engineer, is a sensible
and sarcastic little person with an accurate appre-
ciation of the side on which his bread is buttered.
When the Opposition gets its innings his papa-

of his kidneys. He got along all right with the
remaining organ for many years, but no civic

the circumstances. Three kidneys would barely
suffice for some of them.
Sir Charles Holled Smith, the new Vic.
military chief, took the earliest opportunity for
remarking that “ the men ”’he had seen thus far
“looked like perfect soldiers.” Every new Com-
mandant makes the same old remark, in the same
patronising way, and The Bulletin now rises,
more in sorrow than in anger, to ask what they
are giving us? The “perfect” British soldier—
which was the article that Sir Smith had in his
mind’s eye, of course—isn’t especially famous for
physical or mental excellence, as far as we know.
At the best, he is an ordinary, well-grown man, at
the worst an awkward ass, drilled to do a few
simple things in an absurdly important style.
The discovery that Australians, who start with
an advantage in point of education and meat
supply, can soon learn to look as martial as
though they had been drilled in England doesn’t
surprise us or make us unduly puffed up.

Dear Bulletin,— ln looking over a file of
The Bulletin for ’Bo—its first year—l came

The Victorian Bar, at the present time,
is declared to be the poorest in ability ever known
in the history of the province. Chief-Justice
Madden has recently said privately that he really
cannot see where any future judges are to come
from, when other vacancies occur. A great light
was no doubt withdrawn when the last judicial
appointment was made.
J. A. Andrews, the Sydney Anarchist, sen-
tenced last week to five months’ gaol for sedition,
was originally a clerk in a Vic. public department!
which he quitted owing to a dispute with
one of the public service commissioners. His
official troubles culminated in brain-fever, from
which he_ seems to have but partially recovered.
After this he took up journalism and made a
precarious living by his pen, his chance of getting
permanent work being utterly discounted by the
fact that he had Anarchy on the brain. For a
lime he edited an organ of the A.N.A., but it
died soon, and then the unfortunate Andrews
drifted into the general ruck of wharf orators.
Although a man possessing a fine gift of literary
expression, Andrews is a miserable speaker;
and when he stands blurting out unfinished sen-
tences under the red flag, wearing a beard a month
old, with his boots tied up with string and his hair
sticking through his split hat, he looks an exact
replica of the tramp of the American comic papers,
and even his supporters hardly take him
seriously. Yet the poor fellow started life with
a good brain, and even now is regarded by all
who know him as honest to a fault—which view
seems to have obtruded itself upon |Mr. Justice
Simpson, who presided at his trial and evidently
regarded the man with compassion.’
A recent Black and White reproduces
two charming works from the brush of Tennyson
Cole. They represent that artistic Lothario in
this year’s Academy where Altson, Maokennal,
Bunny and Longstaff also appear for the first
time. The Australian work is high y praised. It
ls almost needless to say that one of Cole s pieces
is an idealised portrait of Mrs. Cole.
T. P. Webb, the new Vie. Com. of In-
come-tax, is the first native of the province who
was admitted to the Bar. His father went from
Sydney to Melbourne as Collector of Customs in
Jan., '36, and his sister was the first white person
born in Port Phillip. T.P. W. married a daughter
of John Thomas Smith, who imported the first
donkey and was seven times Mayor of Melbourne,

LADY G. H. SMITH.
N.S.W. Justice Windeyer, who has twice
jiifcely rebuked solicitors for appearing before him
in dress other than that prescribed by law-court
etiquette, himself once appeared in tweed and
,without hjs gown before Justice Hargrave. On
that occasion the advocate, hastily covering him-
self, apologised for the inadvertence, but Har-
grave blurted out, “Oh, get on with business; I
don’t care.”
N.S.W. Master-in-Equity Deffel called at
a Sydney house one afternoon, and found nobody
at home except the hired girl, who enquired
“What name?” “Deffel, Master-in-Equity,” he
said, and left. Later on, when the housefather
returned, the girl told him that a gentleman had
called. “What was his name?” enquited the
householder. “I don’t know, sir,” replied
Bridget, “tut he said he was ‘The Divil, and
the Masther of Iniquity.”
The Government doctor in a small Aus-
tralian town was officially informed by the
Colonial Secretary that if he could not deny being
of intemperate habits lie must resign. To which
the medico replied : “Sir, of course I drink, and,
by the way, you drink too, don’t you ? The only
difference is that my small salary will not allow of
wine at dinner, consequently I drink colonial
beer between meals—in fact, whenever an oppor-
tunity arises.—Yours, &o.” He’s still in the
billet.
Francis Gill, the Coolgardie mining-regis-
trar, has been called to Perth to assist the Minister
in drafting mining regulations. Which means
that Gill will do all the drafting and the Minister
will get all the credit. Gill is an old Kanakaland
mining expert, having been a trusted official in
the North before Queensland was known as
Bananaland. He was warden at Charters Towers
in the ancient days, and relieved Warden Sellheim
at the Palmer, about the start of the eighties.
Jock M‘lntyre has explained his knight-
hood to a little knot of admirers down at Maldon
(Vic.). He didn’t want the “honor;” never
looked for it, and was quite prepared to die a plain
mister, but Her Gracious Majesty insisted upon
recognising his “long and valuable services in the
colony of Victoria.” In short, the Queen didn’t
feel prepared to die herself until Jock was trans-
lated into Sir John. This little narrative deserves
to be included in the Princess’s pantomime, among
Wheatley’s stories of MTntyre.
A back-blocks N.S. W. municipal councillor
returning thanks for his election “It was usual
for a person in the position he was in to give some
guarantee—some record of his pedigree and per-
formances. He was of Irish descent on his
mother’s side, and his father was an American.
He did not know which he took after, but he
thought the mother’s influence was the greatest.
His mother died a sincere Catholic, and his old
man died a Protestant. His mother had a front
place in Heaven, as to his father he did not know.”
Fiddler Duke Alfred, of Saxe-Coburg, is
senior Doctor of Laws of Melb. University,
with Vic. Chief Justice Madden as runner-up;
Chancellor Brownless, who was the first to receive
the degree, is senior Doctor of Medicine ; and
Prof. M‘Coy is senior Doctor of Science. H. C. E.
Childers is senior Master of Arts; Dr. William
Moore, senior Master of Surgery; J. M. Camp-
bell, senior Master of Laws; Booth, senior Master
of Civil Engineering; and young Norman Wils-
more, who lately married Miss Leonora Jessie
Little, B.Sc., is Master of Science.
Captain Haynes, of Perth Mudgee
Haynes’ brother—a skilful doctor and a splendid
shot, has yet to learn to ride. During Gov. Kin-
tore’s visit to Perth, the local volunteers formed
themselves into mimic guards of honor. The
captain-doctor was at the head of his warriors,
and in the heat of the battle his horse shied and
pitched him off. A little while afterwards he
was endeavouring to explain away the mishap to
a coterie of friends, assuring them that such a
thing could never happen again. Just then a
piece of paper flew before the horse, and off went
the captain once more.
Australia holds only 12 men entitled to
write after their names the letters F.R.S. (Fel-
low of the Royal Society of London) one of the
most coveted of scientific distinctions. Of these
Victoria possesses four—Government Botanist
Baron von Mueller, Government Astronomer
Ellery, Geology Professor M‘Coy, and Banker
Verdon ; Maoriland also claims four—Go vernment
Geologist Hector, Biology Professor Jeffrey Par-
ker, Geology Professor Capt. Hutton, and Rev.
W. Colenso; N.S. Wales has but two —Govern-
ment Astronomer Russell, and Chemistry Pro-
-ossqr Liversidge; South Australia also Ins but
two in Postmaster-General Todd and Physiology
Lecturer Dr. Stirling. Of the 12 fellows, no less,
than five—to wit, Von Mueller, Ellery, M‘Coy,.
Hector, and Stirling were originally intended
and trained for the medical profession, but only,
Stirling has stuck to it.
The scholarly R.C. Archbishop Redwood,,
of Wellington (M.L.), is the most unassuming of
men. He is an expert violinist and owns a Stradi
which enthusiasts make pilgrimages to see. The-
Redwood family originally came from the Duke of.
Norfolk’s estate, settling, many years ago, ini
Nelson. The Archbishop is brother to Henry
Redwood, the well-known M.L. racing man, and!
is himself, in a strictly lay and self-deprecatory
way, a fine judge of a horse. Indeed, Henry, who.
hardly fills the popular ideal of an ascetic Catholic;
dignitary, declares his brother should have beeni
the racing man, and he (Henry) the archbishop..
When Francis Redwood returned per s.s. from,
Rome to Wellington, after elevation to the arch-
bishopric, Henry was among the crowd waiting om
the wharf to receive him, and saluted his dis-
tinguished brother in a manner devoid of that-
repose which stamps the caste of VeredeVere..
r l he archbishop, the eyes of the assemblage andl
his blushing honors thick upon him, naturally-
stiffened somewhat. Said Henry to him, “Oh,,
you needn’t put on jam with me, Francis. Tell,
ye what, I’ll pray ypu for a fiver any day.”
Lord Neville’s inclusion in the Brassey
suite recalls his brother, “Beauteous Bill,” oneof.'
the Loch aides. That youth once visited a famed*
Melb. phrenologist incognito, and underwent the-
usual pate-prospecting. When he left, a by-
stander asked the “Professor” his late client’s;
name. “I don’t know,” rejoined the sage, “but,
unless his bumps lie, he’s the biggest fool in Mel-
bourne.” It is also related by some wicked person)
that the same Adonis, leaving cards for the-
first time at the Govt. House of a neighboring;
province, met an Irish under-gardener in the?
grounds, and lisped out to him some haw-haw
query. The man stared stupidly, not understand-
ing a word of the question. It was repeated again)
and again, with no better success. At last the-
Irishman, instinctively suspecting that the-
stranger was gibbering mad, took to his heels andl
ran for dear life, hotly pursued by the enragedt
chappie, loudly calling upon him to halt. How-
ever, as Pat boasted afterwards, he kept him ate
bay with his spade, shouting “Be off wid ye.
now,” and “Kape away, will yez !”until the noise?
attracted notice and the matter was cleared up..
But, all the same, despite his wondrous methods,
of speech, Beauteous Bill was a kindly young;
fellow and by no means destitute of brains.
Queensland people “in the know” say/
that Griffith, not Windeyer, is the Judge meant,
by the legal confrasharkity for translation to tfen
Privy Council. They allege that Windeyer is com-
paratively unknown outside N.S. Wales; while-
Griffith has his political record and some Imperial!
prestige, besides his rank as G.0.M.G., to recom.-
mend him. By all accounts, Sam is itching to be-
off Q. Supreme Court Bench, where the live.
Lilley and the dead Cockle—whose judgments,,
if The Bulletin mistakes not, were but once-
apiece set aside point scornful fingers ate
him every time a reversed decision comes,
back from the Privy Council which hap-
pens a great deal too often. Real andl
Harding, too—especially the latter—make things,
uncomfortable for their smart, but not learned,,
brother by rude, unfeeling remarks about the’
queer law supplied, nowadays ; and, altogether,,
Sam thinks this is a cold, cruel world, despite the-
solace of £3500 per annum. So Tommy Byrnes;
is paying for his early patronage by trying to-
shove his senior into the lotus-eating land, where-
he may sit and sip Ids nectar while his bolts are?
hurled far below him at the antipodes, and where?
offensive comment will never reach him. Bute
The Bulletin advises Griffith not to throw-
away his dirty Queensland money before he is
quite sure of the clean English substitute.

There are, in Queensland, more than
11,000 Kanaka graves.—Worker.
When next he denounces Protective
duties N.S.W. Premier Reid should remember
that the receiver is as bad as the thief.
Gresley Lukin, now special correspondent
at Wellington for the Otago Daily Times, is
credited with having invented the M.L. “alleged

S.M. Herald says it is M‘Millan’s dis-

Cabinet life. M‘Millan himself says it’s his in-

The actual cost of paying the members of
the Vie. standing army—the price of handing
each tin-pot Tommy Atkins his 2s. a day over the
counter —is .£1 ss. per man annually.
There are said to be 8000 miles of closed
roads in Victoria. The adjacent landholders
annex all this, and, as a rule, without paying
rent or purchase money. They don’t even pay
taxes on it.
The N.S.W. Public Works Committee,
getting ready at Reid’s bidding to reap all the
time till a dissolution, costs the country £42 per
sitting—a sitting meaning, on many occasions, less
than half-an-hour’s work.
It is proposed that the names of distin-
guished visitors and others outside the public
service who receive free-passes over N.S.W. rail-
ways shall be published in the Government
Gazette immediately the pass is given.
A society for prosecuting felons and
swindlers was instituted in 1767 in London, and
still exists. A similar association is wanted in
Australia, as the business entanglements of lead-
i ig numbers of Government baulk the action of
justice.
Much grumbling in S.A. Labor circles
because Kirkpatrick, M.L.C., who gets ,£2OO a
year Parliamentary salary, acts as paid canvasser
for the labor weekly. When the Labor M.’sP.
were elected it was understood they were not to
accept outside work.
A big distillery-company is projected in
Sydney. It is nothing short of a national crime
to have bad spirits sold in a corn and wine pro-
ducing country. With proper government Aus-
tralia should turn out a wholesome article cheaper
than the imported poison.
“There is no question that these so-called
colonial honors and their distribution are offen-
sive to public sentiment,” says the Age, with an
air of just having discovered something. But
the Age goes on offending public sentiment by
“sirring” every tagged crawler.
There is a movement in S.A. Opposition
circles to appoint Hague as Opposition leader,
displacing Downer, bis colleague. The S.A.
Oppositionists have five leaders—Moule, Solomon,
Castine, Downer, and Grainger. Each con-
siders himself heaven-born and won’t follow the
other trash.
Parkes describes Vic. Parliament House
as “a palace fit for a king to live in.” The im-
plication here is that a house fit for a king is too
good for the representatives of the people. Which
reveals a true old Tory appreciation of the some-
thing more than human once supposed to reside in
the kingly person.
Sydney Telegraph: “The proverb that
hungry men will eat dirty pudding never Lad a
more striking illustration in politics since the
Dibbs Government, after looking on in silence for
a spell, decided to support Frank Cotton’s land-
value taxation proposals.” “Dirty pudding” is
the Telegraph’s latest name for the land-tax.
The Purification of Polls Act Irdk got
things down so fine now in Victoria that a Mel-
bourne eleotor of many years standing was dis-
franchised lately for taking a trip to Qaeenscriff
with his family. The officer called white lie was
out, and after banging ineffectually at the door,
decided that he had removed and struck him off
accordingly, and after that no power on earth
could get him on again.
The full advantages of an export trade are
not fully understood by the public. A “ home”
manufacturer whenever short of cash would con-
sign a shipment to his colonial agent, draw against
it at his bank, and so tide over the pinch. But
now the provinces are manufacturing and protecting
their workers by means of the tariff, Australia is
ceasing to be a dumping-ground for impecunious
manufacturers.
In welcoming to N.S.W. Supreme Court
Bench his ex-political colleague, Mr. Justice
Simpson, upon whom he himself had conferred
the judicial appointment, lawyer-Premier Reid
“spoke feelingly” of Judge Simpson’s “strong
reluctance to accept the position at the expense of
finally severing himself from the ranks of the
Bar.” The Bulletin doesn’t believe that Judge
Simpson was one bit reluctant. His Honor, in his
new sphere (long may he adorn it!), gets ,£2600 a
year certain, can’t be removed from office save by
a vote of both Houses of Parliament, and is legally
entitled, should he become incapacitated for
work even one minute after appointment, to a
life-pension of .£l5O per month.
Daybreak, the Maoriland women’s paper,
conducted exclusively by women, will advocate
a steady increase of the land-tax and correspond-
ing decrease of Customs duties, the betterment
principle, pensions for the old and infirm, and
finding work by the State for all who are willing
to work but cannot get the opportunity; also
State ownership of monopolies, such as the drink
traffic, railways, coal mines, gas, water, tramways.
Victoria pays three military commandants
at the same time. General Tulloeh, who left his
post some months before his time was up, con-
tinues to draw his screw until the expiry of the
contract. Col. Holled Smith, his recently-
arrived successor, does not take up active duty
for some weeks yet, nevertheless he draws his
salary. And Col. Penno, the acting-commandant,
of course receives commandant’s pay. Law and
Order !
Henry Wrixon, who helped to misrepre-
sent Victoria at the Ottawa Conference, and more
recently prattled Imperialism at the Colonial
Institute, is on his way back to Melbourne. It
were vain to hope that Wrixon will not be
but we may at least be spared a long
story of his foreign achievements. There is just
a chance of a providential murder, or the final
test-match, clashing with Wrixon’s arrival, in
which case his impressions of Europe and America
nia y get boiled down to a brief paragraph.
The British Government has agreed to
restrict the importation into Britain of goods
made in foreign prisons. Now, Ereetrade is a
theory absolute, a doctrine immaculate, not to be
altered in outline in the slightest degree. Or, it
is nothing. Anything that deflects the rigidity of
the Freetrade principle bursts up the whole scheme
of economy. What, then, is the real result—with
more potent and more patent results to follow —of
this anti-Freetrade step taken by the Freetrade
Government of Freetrade England ? It is the
prophetic wail of the Freetrade banshee.
The alleged Freetrade Govt, of Great
Britain has positively refused to abolish the
Indian five per cent, import duty against Lan-
cashire cottons ! And on the stated ground that
it refused to sacrifice Indian interests to a section
of British trade ! ( After this, the deluge ! Here
is a public confession that Protection is necessary
for some countries—lndia, for example ! It is a
public denial of the Gospel of Freetrade. It is
the first “ mark time ” order of the drill-sergeant,
preparatory to an attempt to revive British agri-
culture, and to leave ideals to the ideal world of
fancy and imagination.
Among the strongest of the politicians
rejected at last M.L. general election was George
Fisher, long M.H.R. for Wellington, and at one
time a member of the Atkinson Administration.
Daring the years “Our George”—an almost per-
fect physical double of N.S.W. ex-Minister Gar-
van—held the Wellington popularvote in thehollow
of his hand a bitter feud raged between him and
all the local newspapers, which abused him at all
times, and with redoubled fervour when an elec-
tion was pending. If they forgot to be nasty,
George carefully stirred them up with a long pole,
until they shriekingly prophesied his political
extinction in largest available caps. Then he
went in at head of poll. Last election the news-
papers conspired to leave “Our George” alone.
As a natural consequence he was defeated.
The miserable Clarke scandal, in which
the twelve-months-married wife of a Sydney
suburban Anglican clergyman sued for divorce on
the grounds of her husband’s alleged cruelty, has
had a great deal more attention than it really
deserved. Mr. Clarke (it was known to his wife
and her mother before the marriage that he had
been a patient in Callan Park lunatic-asylum) first
came into newspaper prominence by an unsuccess-
ful effort he made to recover the custody of
his wife, who, he claimed, bad been taken
away from him by his mother-in-law. He has
long acted most eccentrically in and out of
church. The petitioner, obviously a lady
of extremely weak will and rickety nerves,
told a long and harrowing story of how her rev.
husband had sent her into hypnotic trances, and
kicked her, and beaten her for not finding a
hidden treasure while hypnotised, and stripped
her naked and poured water over her and cut her,
and rolled her over hoop-iron and tins “150
yards in a paddock,” and done various other things,
which were written out on paper and handed up
to Judge Windeyer. On the other hand Mr.
Clarke sought to prove that his wife was a weak
and hysterical woman who frequently saw spirits,
and was a somnambulist and had to be restrained
for her own protection. Judge Windeyer, who
would appear to take great interest in anything
pertaining to spirit-manifestations and other
occult vagaries, found unreservedly for Mrs.
Clarke, and excited some surprise by treating the
poor parson in his judgment as a responsible
entity. At the end of the case the rev. gentleman
was arrested by the police and locked up in the
lunacy receiving-house.

THE CLARKE (SYDNEY) DIVORCE CASE.
Rev. JAMES CLARKE. Mrs. CLARKE.
Australia is now mainly governed by
“Royal” (!) Commissions. They are called
“ royal ” —because they are nearly always useless.
The Bulletin, some time ago, pointed out
how the natives of India were likely to he subjected
to an excise-tax which protects Lancashire cotton
goods at the expense of native industry. N.S. VV.
affords a parallel case. In 80, Gladstone imposed
a tax on beer, but repealed the previous duties on
brewers’ materials —malt, sugar, &c. In ’B7,
Parkes and Burns put a tax on beer and did not
take off the tax on materials. Thus, as a con-
temporary remarks, “the N.S.W. brewer, paying
taxes on both materials and beer, is expected to
compete against the outsider who pays on beer
only. The home producer is thus taxed to en-
courage the foreigner. This is the contrary of the
usual process, Freetrade run mad.” Which circum-
stance had something to do with the Toohey-Dibbs
split.
“Gov. Duff is in the position of being
unable to say one word in repl-y to Dibbs’ grossly
unmanly imputations,” says Sydney D.T. The
hocus-pocus of this is too clumsy to attain its end.
A common Parliamentary trick is for a member
who knows that he will be attacked in the House,
and who has not a good explanation to offer, to
absent himself. When the attacking member
comes in due course to the particular delinquent,
that hero’s barraokers furiously yell “ Shame !
shame!” “What shame?” asks the attacker.
“He’s absent, he’s absent,” cry the barraokers,
“ But I told him I would attack him to-night.”
“Shame! shame!” chorus the barraokers; “you’re
revealing a private conversation. Shame 1” If
Gov. Duff liked, lie could within ten hours hand
over the correspondence for publication.
Brunker and Parkes show
a mutual liking for a few
minutes’ private and confiden-
tial talk when they meet in
public places.
The clause in the Vic-
torian Income-tax Act which
specially maddens the foreign
capitalist is one drawn up by
Attorney-General Isaacs for the
special purpose of preventing the
money-lender passing on the tax
to the borrower. Most provi-
sions of this kind can be dodged
by a clever lawyer, but Isaac A.
Isaacs has apparently made his
waterproof—at all events, the
hole in it hasn’t yec been found.
Therefore, quite a number of
people are uttering the usual
jeremiads about the “ with-
drawal of foreign capital,” and
quite a number of other people
profess to believe them. The
fact that the capitalist has to
pay income-tax in England as
well as in Victoria, so that he
gains nothing at all by his
“ withdrawal,” doesn’t seem to
enter into anybody’s calculation.
One of the arrangements
made by the Premiers’ Confer-
ence at Hobart is that each pro-
vince shall send 10 delegates to
a Eederal Convention, but “ any
Parliament which thinks 10
delegates an insufficient number
to properly frame a Federal Con-
stitution may amend the Bill
and increase the number.”
Suppose five provinces pass the
bill as it stands and appoint 50
delegates among them. And
then suppose at the last moment
Westralia passes it also, but
“increases the number ” of de-
legates, and enacts that they
shall be nominated by the Go
vernment instead of elected bj
the people. Then, further, sup
pose that John Forrest appoint,.'
60 grim old Tories of his own
sort, and they vote down all tha
rest, and fix up, on their own
account, a fine, ancient, moss-
grown, convict-time Constitu-
tion for all Australia. Sup-
posing all these things, which
seem to be quite possible, won't
the great cause of Federation be
getting along beautifully?

to take charge of property, somehow.
Dear Bulletin, — Another tight place.
Mat. llealy, horsebreaker on Coo-coo Downs, was
riding a filly the second time out when the animal
bolted. He couldn’t pull her, and steered straight
at a big tree, just to steady her a bit. She faced
it, and in the next stride would have tunnelled it,
but the hand of Providence struck the tree with
lightning, causing the trunk to divide and daylight
to show between the halves. The nag jumped to
go through it, but, in the waggery of the storm,
the tree closed, and horse and rider were jammed
and suspended six feet above ground. One
struggled and the other cursed till sundown, when
the tree burst and the mare dropped on her legs,
Healy reckons it the tightest place ever he was in.
Sti r i.e Rudd. Q.
In Italy, the charge for admission to a
public crematorium is 45., and for that amount
yon can spend a pleasant day watching the incine-
ration of the dead. The money goes to pay
cremation expenses for the poor. The desire to
sit around and watch the big furnace is presum-
ably only another aspect of that craving which
makes the old woman next door come in on tiptoe
to see the body after it is “ laid out,” and which
makes people go to funerals. In Scotland, not
many years ago, one of the worst things that could
be said about a young man was that “ he went
about a good deal to funerals.” This reproach
didn’t imply that he was a morbid and unwhole-
some individual, but that he was fast and riotous
and unsteady, and had an obvious tendency to
dissipation. No self-respecting girl would marry
a young man who went about a good deal to
funerals. He was always regarded with suspicion
as a person of unbridled desires who lacked self-
restraint. Other people wanted to go to funerals,
but they only indulged the craving in moderation,
and knew where to draw the line; the man who
gave way to funerals, on the other hand, was a sob
and a crape-drunkard. Even when he swore off
no one felt sure about the permanence of his
recovery ; he was always liable to relapse.

Last Saturday, Sydney Daily Telegraph’s

The S.M. Herald cannot, even at a penny,
relinquish its position as the Jeamesof Sydney.
In that capacity it has been giving, with grovel-
ling ostentation, premier place in its daily news
columns to the bespangled It, which it styles
“Prince Joseph of Battenberg.”
* « *
Premier Reid, of N.S.W., paid Mr. Joseph
Battenberg an “official ” visit. Why “official?”
The public has nothing to do with Mr. Reid’s
private calls, and it has certainly nothing to do
with Mr, Joseph Battenberg. But Mr. Reid’s
“ official ” calls are the public’s affairs. And J.
Battenberg is not even an affair. Why an “ offi-
cial ” visit ?
# • #
Did Joseph of Battenberg get a N.S.W.
free railway piss for himself and several colonels?
“The Railway Commissioners made special
arrangements for the comfort of the distinguished
visitor.”

Melbourne society was very much annoyed
when Lord Yarmouth fell into the hands of a
retired drap t and refused to accept invita-
tions unless his host, hostess and family went
too. The irritation was intensified when the
Buckleys also captured Joseph of Batten-
berg. One of the Buckley sons came out on the
same ship as the young Battenberg, and became
“chummy” with him. S issiety thinks it per-
fectly horrid that a retired person, to whom it has
owed money, and has only paid after pressure—if
at all—should secure the two great social celebri-
ties in this most unwarrantable fashion.

The New Women of Melb. are shaking
hands with each other over the Brassey appoint-
ment, as the present Lady Brassey is alleged to
hold most “advanced” views and even to coun-
enance the knickorbocker brigade. Who knows
b it that the damsels of the Guvmentouse garden-
pirties, during the Brassey regime, may be attired
after the fashion set at the historic Healesville
picnic ?
A divorce is already mooted between a
“ very society ” couple joined in the holy bonds

A daily paper infers an abundance of food
at Pitt-tiwn (N.S. W.) settlement, from the fact
that the births there have been at the rate of

rate is only 33. It should be well-known by now
that a high birth-rate, which is seldom nationally

The Reid Ministry at least has the courage
of some of its convictions —such as those convic-
tions are. For instance, Minister Gould has just
become godfather of a new prison gag, and Colonial
Sec. Brunker has ordered (despite an old-time
order by his occasionally-sentimental predecessor,
Parkes) that certain decrepit paupers be shifted
from a crowded inland asylum to a more roomy
place alongside Rook wood general cemetery. We
have said that Gould is godfather of a new gag,
but it is not a barbarous gag. It is a humane
gag. Similarly, Brunker does not propose to ask
that the decrepit paupers shall look out from their
new home right on to the burial-ground—he is
going to have it screened off by an avenue of pines.
But perhaps, after all, Brunker is right. lit is a
common experience that human sentiment and
human indifference adapt themselves to circum-
stances. A month’s residence at Rookwood would
probably furnish the spectacle of gangs of poor old
cripples, each with both legs in the grave, strad-
dling tombstones, smoking and swapping lies in
the graveyards, playing pitch-and-toss or mumble-
peg under the shade of the monuments or upon
the unfeneed mounds.
Pah ! when we go, we go; that matter’s clear ;

And while we live, we d just as lief live here,

That N.S.W. Civil Service scandal has
been quietly hushed up. The culprit is an official
of position in a sub-department, and has numerous
friends with much influence in high places—which
may account for the fact that though the Civil
Service Commission imputed to him some very
serious delinquencies, for which a board of enquiry
recommended his dismissal, he has merely been
told not to do it again. The case is to be ven-
tilated in Parliament.

The legal question as to the late s.s. Alert’s
seaworthiness reminds one that a certain pas-
senger steamer, now ploughing Victorian waters,
is said to run constant risk of a boiler-explosion.
But if the oft-predicted catastrophe should occur,
a crowd of important experts would come forward
to testify that the boilers were th iroughly steam-
worthy because they didn't burst before. Experts

With the summer weather comes the Sun-
day-school picnic. Not long since a maintenance-
case was reported in which the applicant, a girl
attending a Sydney Suburban Sunday-school,
stated she was seduced at the annual picnic ; and
later still the Crown prosecuted a man for the
violation of a 14-year old child at another local
outing. But the most remarkable list of accidents
yet recorded is in connection with a Methodist
excursion at Parramatta last week. One boy was
drowned. A girl was run over, and had her legs
broken; whilst another boy sustained concussion
of the brain through being thrown from a swing.
A “visitation of Providence?”

The linotype has qome to stay. At Sydney
Daily Telegraph office composition now only
costs about 3|d. per 1000—instead of 13d. as before.
Brisbane Courier, pondering this, has also intro-
duced the devil among the compos. By the way,
one Australian firm which has displaced some of
its compositors for the machine, has had the grace
to give the poor devils a gratuity of .£lO each to
start a green-grocer’s shop or buy a second-class
funeral.

It now seems tolerably certain that a white
patient named Dickson, discharged from several
hospitals, including the Alfred, at Sydney, as an
incurable cancer subject, has been so far relieved
by a Chinese doctor at Hillend as to seem cured.
However, the white medical profession shakes its
head. “ Perhaps it wasn’t cancer after all, but if
it was—well, just wait for two years before you
speak again.”

The photographic pose of a newly-arrived
Melb. society-lady tells its own tale. The sitter

lady’s neck has to screw itself half-way round the

It is not always advisable to have a choral
service at your wedding. The boys who sing
“ The voice that breathed o’er Eden ” are cold,
unbiassed critics of the show. There is no glamor
about the ceremony so far as those surplieed imps
are concerned. They bring a pitiless gaze to bear
upon it all, and if the bride has turned 28 the
choir whispers “ No chicken !” unanimously, like
one boy speaking. A squattoeratic wedding
occurred at a Southern capital not so long ago.
Reverent reports were published in the local
society prints, but each of the five-and-twenty
choristers spread the news that a “puffy, dissi-
pated-looking man gave the girl away.” Fact.
“Dissipated-looking” was the term used.

In Melbourne they are concerned to know

A court-case was heard in Melb. the other
day which turned upon the superiority of one
brand of liver-press over another. Suggested
Judge A’Beckett when the Case was opened :
“ Hadn’t all gentlemen better leave the court ? ”
Purves’ friend, O'Hara, who was a witness for
plaintiff, and who appeared as an expert in stays,
explained to the court that it was impossible to
point out the virtues of plaintiff’s patent stays
except upon the living model. “It is likely,”
reported the Argus, “ that during the hearing an
adjournment to chambers will be proposed to
enable the suggestion to be adopted.” Forensic
wits discover in this case proof of the need for
the New Woman on the bench ; but what does she
know about stays? There is at least one
“sassiety ” lawyer in Melbourne who knows more
about the merits and demerits of corsets than all
the slab-sided New Women in the city.

for the Victorian fleet at last. The next naval

The d.c. at Sydney Lyceum
is used principally for purposes
of conversation. This is mainly
because the circle of William-
son and Musgrove’s elegant
theatre is the most fashionable
resort of the city; and here the
fashionable and thoroughly high-
toned female and her attendant
dude will talk loudly for 45
minutes straight on end, and
utterly drown the stage pro-
ceedings. The Lyceum d.c.
crowd mostly arrives late.
Tl eatre parties wait outside on
the sta rs for that fourteenth
individual who is always behind
time, and then talk loudly and
block the stage view for 10
minutes while they stand up,
and take off their upper cloth-
ing, and argue whether the
bald-headed youth with the long
nose will sit next to the gushing
child of nature with the red
wrap, or whether the Semitic
young man hadn’t better sit
alongside the anaemic girl with
the aggressive collarbone, and
have on the other side of him
the old, fat she-savage with the
jet beads and the loudly-crink-
ling palmetto fan. Even when
they have apparently settled
down they generally decide to
refix the arrangements, which
involves more standing up and
conversation. Eight of these
parties, together with 44 loose
stragglers, generally arrive dur-
ing the first half-hour of the
performance, and their cordi il
greeting of 78 cus lal acquaint-
ances whom they find alrea dy
seated, and their inquiries about
their 78 friends’ 493 relati ns,
are loud and horrille to liskn
to. The other pares of the house
conduct themselves respectably,
but some day the gallery will re-
volt and express its opinion of the d.c. with emphasis
and old fruit. The Bulletin recommends th;
Firm, if it can’t manage to keep the doors strictly
shut while the curtain is up (this perhaps would
be impracticable in hot weather), to hire a large
prize-fighter with a deep bass voice to order and
enforce “Silence’’ in the d.c. when necessary.

Moderate unbelief lands a man in peculiar
positions. Vic. Justice Williams told the jury in
the Alert case that he ascribed “the disasters to
the destructive agencies of Nature,” and did not
give the Almighty credit for indiscriminately
slaughtering the beings He has created. Are the
“ destructive agencies of Nature ” independent of
Judge Williams’s Almighty? If there is a God
He is the destructive as well as the constructive
agencies of Nature, and will not turn aside a
lightning-flash to save a whole cityful of the
beings He has created. The man who sees a daisy
and believes must not forget the leper-settlement
and the death-adder.

A N.S.W. attorney has just been com-

Which reminds one that there was a time when
the law was really a decently-remunerative pro-
fession in N.S.W. Now, if you advertised for a
solicitor as managing-clerk at .£3 a week in Sydney
you would get 50 applicants—some of them really
good men. And so it is elsewhere all over the
island—and with respect, alas !to nearly all the
professions. For instance, there is hardly a
reporter in Sydney who gets anything like £6 a
week, and the bulk of them don’t get £3. Who
would not rather be a wages miner in Westralia
with £3 10s. a week for eight hours’ daily work
and a chance of one day going out and finding
something for himself, than a newspaper hack
toiling all round the clock for wretched pay and
unable to call his soul his own ?

The Late RANDOLPH T. WANT.
One obvious deduction from the case of G.
T. Newman, about whoso imprisonment Schev
M.l agitates the N.S.W. Justice Department,
is that if Newman, an unemployed who slept in
the Domain and begged victuals, is lawfully
gaoled for failing to pay for the maintenance of
his motherless child in a public institution, the
time is more than ripe for the gaoling of the many
wealthy next-of-kin who have persistently refused
to pay towards the support of demented relatives
in the State asylums.

. Dear Bulletin, —You have taken much
interest in the leprosy question. The Tongan
measles epidemic of last year carried off
2000 natives. In all cases of confirmed leprosy,
after the measles, the leper was cured. Perhaps
the true remedy for leprosy may be inoculation
with the attenuated virus of measles.—W. D.

youngster almost insupportable.

Dr. Springthorpe, of Melbourne, gives a
qualified approval of the diphtheria anti-toxin
remedy. The anti-toxin, he asserts, kills the
diphtheria bacilli and neutralises their toxin, but
does not antagonise the toxines of common sceptic
organisms. Thus, anti-toxin arrests uncompli-
cated true diphtheria, provided it is administered
promptly. But— and herein is the crux of the
general value of the new remedy—if structural
change has already been produced by the disease,
the question of repairing the damage done is
altogether outside the anti-toxin treatment and
effects. Therefore, Dr. Springthorpe argues with
logical force, diphtheria should be treated as
urgently as a case of snakebite. And thereon
hangs the whole case.

Dear Bulletin, Did
you notice in one of the
dailies that the new mission
steamer, John Williams, had
“collected over .£9OO in cash
native contributions?”
From this, it would appear
that it is not the worst thing
in the world to be a mis-
sionary. Considering that
ready cash is almost an un-
known quantity on most of
the stations, the missionaries
evidently know their way
about. The black - coated
tribe has long been noted for
the prowess of its members
as cash collectors, but the
Island brethren seem the
sharpest of the lot. If any-
body w'ell in the know were
to give a truthful account of
how that ,£9OO was collected,
it would probably be very in-
teresting, as a proof of the
influence which the fear of
punishment in a spiritual
state exercises in the tithe-
giving of the Kanaka parish-
ioner. The missionaries
know how to grind corn with
the mills at their disposal.—■

knocked out of the movement by the Judge

themselves is that Judge was haunted by a spook

and with broken ends of rope dangling round
their necks., and with sea-weed in their hair just
as they were fished out of the deep, and with
their brains protruding from shot-holes, all with
their scraggy arms extended to button-hole him
and ask for a full and complete account of how it
came about. And what a pleasant sensation it
would have been, say, at some of the reconstruc-
tion meetings, if some infirm old shareholder
had risen up and moved that all dead shareholders
should wait for the Hoard beyond the borderline,
and argue the matter out there when they would
have all eternity to argue in.

Mr. Randolph Charles Want, who, to the
deep regret of a thousand friends, died last week at
Cannes, .France, was the elder brother of the
N.S.W. Attorney-General, and shared the manli-
ness and kindly nature which have conduced to
“Jack” Want’s universal popularity. Mr. Ran-
dolph Want, eldest son of the late Hon. R. P.
Want, one of Sydney’s best-known solicitors—
killed many years ago in a N.S.W. railway col-
lision—was born in Sydney in 1837, and in 1855
matriculated at Sydney University, of which he
became a Master of Arts. He subsequently prac-
tised as a solicitor in connection with his father’s
old firm (now Johnson, Simpson, Minter and Co.),
and, some years ago, perceiving that London
offered a great opening for an Australian solicitor
of repute, went to England, was admitted as a
solicitor to the High Court of Justice (he was the
first Australian solicitor so admitted), and at
once became the London legal agent of many im-
portant Australian firms. Mr. Want was twice
married—firstly, to the daughter of Lieut.-Colonel
Russell, by whom he had one daughter, who sur-
vives him ; and secondly, to the widow of Mr. J.
T. Wilshire.

same. My best customers are, of course, women,

February 26, 1895,
My Dkak Moorabinda—
Of all men on the face of the earth the medico
is best qualified to make a good choice matri-
monially. A doctor gets the chance, rarely
accorded to other men, of seeing his charmer in
curl-papers or at her very worst, and he can size
up in a twinkling besides whether her blushes
are purchased and if her sparkling teeth are made
in Germany. Other men have not these advan-
tages. They cannot mentally reduce their lady-
love to her chemical constituents, or hold her
fleshless skeleton in their mind’s eye ere making
the fatal plunge. They “pop” in ignorance
attracted by a bright flush that spells scrofula to
a doctor.
I think it is rather a daring thing to marry a
doctor—for they usually have so many fads. Some
of their tricks (such as washing their hands with
disinfectants whenever you pump-handle them)
are harmless enough, but others are not so
innocuous. For example, there is a medico
whose wife, from being an ordinary woman, has
developed quite a feather-pillow appearance owing
to her hubby’s hobbies. He insisted on her leaving
off stays, and fed her on milk like a motherless
calf, with the result that she is now so ex-
panded that she can scarcely waddle across
the street. Now, if that Sawbones went
to join his fathers and left his wife a widow, the
poor woman wouldn’t have the ghost of a chance
of marrying again—nobody but the proprietor of
a chamber of horrors would look at her twice. I
quite believe in wifely obedience and all that sort
■of thing, but I certainly think no man should be
allowed to make a hollow square of his erstwhile
isylph-like bride without her cordial acquiescence.
Then there is the medico who believes in porridge,
and the Sawbones who brings his gaunt family
down to a crust per diem, and the other disciple of
who pins his faith to bare feet—all
■must be trying people to live with, and their con-
duct is likely to damage the goods should the lady
be again upon the market.
Why should “ trained ” nurses so often regale
sick and helpless people with horrible tales ? In
Sydney, the other day, a nurse stoked a lady just
turning the corner after typhoid with tales of
her grisly prowess. “ Oh, we nurses need good
nerves,” she said. “ I have more than
once slept in the same room with a corpse.
The last time, just before I came here, the case
died at two o’clock in the morning, and so
my engagement terminated ; but, as I was really
too exhausted to go home at once, I slept in the
other bed in the room as usual.” And, as sick
people are always more or less morbid, doctors
ought to drive neither black horses, which suggest
funerals, nor white gee-gees—which recall Death
on the pale horse. By the way, the best-looking
doctor’s horse I have seen in Sydney is a veteran
son of old Yattendon, driven by a young medico
whose father is pretty nearly the local doyen of
the profession.
According to a London writer, there are still
fears that the Duke of York, his duchess and
dukelet may visit Australia if the worst comes
to the worst. “ With the colonials,” says this
irrepressible person, “such a trip would be im-
mensely popular, and it is no exaggeration to say
that it would do more good than all the confer-
ences that could be held.”
But the trip would not be so immensely popular
as this benighted London journalist opines. No
fewer than three elevated officials have told me with
a shudder that they only hoped the Duke would
never come near the place. Australia can’t afford
•to hold even a tallow candle to an Emperor these
times, and the fewer big-wigs sailing hither with
their strawberry-leaves in wadding the better for
everybody concerned. Prince George’s appear-
ance" as a married man on the scenes he haunted
un boyhood isn’t a matter for special prayer in the
churches just yet.
I think the weak point in “Aunt Jack” at
Sydney Lyceum was the weird attire of Bouoi-
eault as a solicitor. I never thought to see the
day when the gifted Dot would almost rely on a
mulberry handkerchief for low-comedy effects d la
Johnny Toole; and besides, in a place like Sydney
—where the solicitor is mostly a thing of bristling
linen whom you can see through his brazen,
blindless, office-window parting his hair before the
glass ere he gives the girls a treat —-a legal shark
"n shoddy pepper-and-salt checks, and a farmer’s
hat on a bottle-brush head of hair, seems oppres-
sively stagey somehow. I think, too, that the
R. and B. ladies are getting a little careless in
their dressing. In the first act Mrs. Brough wore
a mousey-colored skirt—a well-cut blouse bodice,
small wintry bonnet and a fur muff—a very smart
winter walking dress. Then comes Grace Noble
in a bay frock with black points topped by a
bonnet in coxcomb crimson (but, oh ! why did
rn . T ..
At the Tasmanian International Exhibi-
cion one of the prettiest sights is undoubtedly ‘ h !,
show-case containing the new excellent toilet
requisite, “ Amykos,” which has of late got such
a popular name amongst the people of Ana-
tralia, and is getting a good hold of the Tas-
manians and their guests at the Exhibition.
This shows that this excellent preparation for
the skin, teeth and mouth is thoroughly appre-
dated when once used. Sold by all chemists,“etc.,

she wear a breast-knot of raw-red flowers? It
was quite a chromatic jolt!)-no furs. A very
smart autumn walking dress. And then enters
Emma Temple in calico— summer ! When they
all got together it looked like a costume tableau
of the seasons (modern version), and what pricked
me more than anything was that they didn’t stick
to their colors either. In the last act, one short
stage day from the first, Mrs. Brough came forth
in springlike lilac with a pale parasol and a floral
hat! The climate of stageland must be very vari-
able indeed when the star wears a muff in the first
act and muslin in the last !
One doesn’t expect much repose of manner in a
wild farce like “Aunt Jack,” but I was pleased to
see that at any rat<? nobody sat on the dinner-table.
In the piece gone before, Mr. Dorrington (I am
told lie is a son of Mr. and Mrs. Madge Robert-
son Kendall) deposited his lengthy person all
among Auntie’s tea-things—sitting on the festive
board as coolly as a penny roll, so I quite expected
him to take a seat among Aunt Jack’s dessert.
He didn’t, however.
The women in front were very V-shaped, and I
saw a new pattern in coiffures. It ought to be
called the jug-handle style. It appears to be a
narrow band of back-hair standing off the head
like the thing you grab a teapot by. Whether it
is the Australian love for the saddle-colored
beverage that thus imbues the fashionable female
with a wild longing to look as much like a teapot
as possible, I really cannot say. At any rate, the
jug-handle mode would give Romeo a great ad-
vantage in the first connubial row, if he felt it his
marital duty to try and shake sense into Juliet.
In the recent Clarke divorce-case, when Judge
Windeyer presented to the world the unique spec-
tacle of a learned Judge reading a severe homily
on the antics of an apparently irresponsible
agent, torturing the poor man and torturing the
public, another anomaly was the anxiety of his
Honor to have hypnotism clearly described to
him. The patroniser of Mrs. Mellon and a chair-
man of Mrs. Besant’s really didn’t know (in his
legal capacity) that by staring into a weak-minded
person’s eyeballs and moving your hands like a
frog’s hind legs you could send that person on a hazy
journey to Timbuotoo. And yet His Honor
closely investigates the peeping and muttering busi-
ness when his horsehair is hooked on a nail. But with
his legal robes on he glares at plaintiff and asks,
“What is hypnotism?” as if the word were in
vogue in racing stables only. It is really too
refreshing.
But a divorce Judge has a rosy and thankful
billet, and now that Judge Windeyer (whose
record in the rule absolute season is from 14 to 17
divorces per diem) has ukased that, in future, the
badly-matched couple will only have four months
instead of six to wait between the hearing and the
granting, the judicial blacksmith must assume
the aspect of a guardian angel to people who want
their matrimqpial hobbles undone. For, after all,
it must be ever so much more pleasant to get
divorced than to get married, and I’d venture a
modest bet that a divorce Judge dispenses more
joy than ever the priests do.
Though divorce, mind you, is a man’s game in the
long run. It was only meant for a woman, pro-
vided she’s attractive and very much on the sunny
side of 40, while a man may take advantage of it
long after his head has come through his hair. The
average woman is done-for, in a physically attrac-
tive sense, long before 40, especially in Australia ;
while a man—if he starts with a good constitution
and takes lots of care of himself, is really as good
as brand-new at 55. Take any old married couple
you like. He is large and festive, and when
“out on his own,” as the song says, girls of 19 are
pleased if he looks Jt them and see a possible
lover in him. She is wrinkled and hollow-eyed or
extra fat and cushiony. If he.died no young man
would regard her as a possible partner, but if she
“pegged out” he (if tolerably “ warm ”) could
take the pick of the basket. People who talk
about the equality of the sexes are advised to
ponder over this discrepancy.
Australians are evidently growing careless about
princes. The only thing so far known of Prince
Joseph of Battenberg is that he expresses himself
in terms of profound admiration about the
beauties of Sydney Harbor, and that he has been
up the Blue Mountains (iome people call them the
“ Blues.”)
Another distinguished visitor —at any rate, one
who will demand more or less careful treatment —
arrived in Sydney recently. He is a Hebrew pro-
fessional man, and the first of strong man San-
dow’s pupils to sail up the Beautiful Harbor.
The engagement is announced of Miss Salomons,
daughter of the famous Q.C., and l>r. French, son
of Col. French, late commandant of theßananaland
swashbucklers. Miss Salomons became engaged
abroad. Which should encourage a host of damsels
to go and do likewise. Then the wedding of
Sydney’s most prominent operating surgeon, Dr.
M'Oorrnick, with Miss Cropper, was to eventuate
on Tuesday (26ch Feb.), a little too late for notice
in The Bulletin.
Talking of weddings, here is a chance you don’t
often get now-a-days. In one daily paper’s long-
drawn-out account of the smart Dangar-Dowling
wedding, the following strange remark appeared.
Speaking of the cleverness, as entertainers, of the
host and hostess the report said: “No expense
was spared to make everybody feel the situation
they were placed in.” That must indeed have
been charming.
By the way, Australia has had an elopement
—the inevitable good-looking, healthy and
pleasant Johnny from ’Ome with only a tennis-
racket for assets, and the usual confiding girl who
spooned him as a true woman should, regardless
of ways and means. But papa, a magnate of some
wealth, had his eye on the fairy-tale. He wrote to
the blade’s mother in England explaining his
would-be son-in-law’s impecunious condition, and
that fond parent replied that she would settle
.£250 per annum on her boy if papa would do the
same by his daughter. Having several daughters
to be dotted, papa refused the terms and whistled
his loving child off her natural prey; but love
laughs at incensed parents with right on their
side. The maiden undutifully eloped with and
married her victim, and papa, to be on the safe
side in future, hustled her sisters—grown-up young
Pubes who resented it bitterly—to boarding-
school. Unless he cools down they will probably
be kept at their ABO until the safe age of forty
or so.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Not every cricket enthusiast can keep his in-
terest at boiling point match after match. So there was
many a big patch of green to be seen among the crowd on
Sydney Association Ground on Saturday, although the
last interprovincial match of the season was being played.
The process of taking cracks on the legs in
smiling fashion was successfully conducted by Jones, the
fast bowler in South Australia’s first innings. He took
three of M'Kibbin’s fastest, one after the other. M‘Kib-
bin’s fast delivery seems from the pavilion very like a
throw.
Everyone sympathised with young Clement
Hill, the S.A. colt, when, feeling sure that one fast hall of
M'Kihbin’s which lie missed was going past Howell to the
boundary, he started lor a run. He was half-way down
the wicket when Howell knocked the stumps down. He
lays on the wood, does that youngster, and although he
had a fair slice of luck, there was much merit, and even
more promise than merit, in his play. His first innings
was for 30. He crouches slightly as the bowler is going
to deliver the ball, and this crouch, on a front elevation,
lends part of his back the rotundity of a Hottentot’s.
Young Hill, aforesaid “colt,” S.A. batsman
and wicketkeeper, w ill celebrate his 18th anniversary on
March 28. He is one of eight sons in a family of 15. When
15 years of age he made 360 runs—the highest individual
innings ever played by an Australian. He weighs list.
51b., and is one of the b2St footballers in Adelaide.
Sid. Gregory says he won’t be surprised to see
Hill second wicketkeeper of the next Australian Eleven.
With the exception of Gregory, Donnan and
Iredale, the N-.S.W. team fielded in a style which made
Giffen and his satellites smile in the first innings. Dyer,
missed at 5, scored 71; Darling, let off at 20, didn’t come
out until his 70th run had been hit. Darling hit two fives
and ten fours.
One of Gregory’s hard throws split Kelly’s left
hand between the second and third fingers, and Howell
put on the N.S.W. wicket-keeper’s pads and gloves.
Howell had to eat humble pie when the byes went to the
fence and when he missed those very easy chances of
catching and slumping. But Howell doesn’t profess to
be a wicket-keeper, and he is, moreover, the easiest-going
fellow in the world, and while he did his level best he
smiled at his mistakes as complacently as any spectator.
Somehow, none of the interprovinoial players seemed to
take this match too seriously. All serious thoughts
seemed to be reserved for the common enemy, the
English, who have won two out of the four test-matches,
leaving the rubber in the balance of fate.
The sound of that hard clout which Garrett got
on the thigh from one of Jones's fastest made Hie most
inattentive spectator get up and ask what w as the matter.
They looked well, those stalwart South Austra-
lians ; sauntering out upon the bright green sward just
before 6 o’clock for the N.S.W. second innings. They
were led by George, who, on state occasions, wears the
air of a gracious and sportive blood-hound.
L. Moore went in first with Garrett for the
N.S.W. second innings, and was nearly runout in the
first over. Garrett, say one or two of the home team, is a
poor runner between the wuckets. Gail Garrett for a
short run and he will say, “Yes! No! No! Yes.”
There was much easy dash in many of “brother
Waller’s” drives last Saturday, and his 30 (not out) were
all deserved.
The feature of the match was the bowling
of M Kibbin, who has probably won a place in the
test-eleven by his fine performance. In all he took
14 of the 20 wickets for 190 runs -a little worse than 13J
runs per wicket; and his second innings’ record of 8 for
66 in an interprovincial contest shows that more will he
heard of the tough young Batlmrst lawyer. Giffien and
Darling put together 65 and 39 respectively; but the
rest of the team collapsed for 56, and N.S.W. won by 111
runs.
The match was fairly contested, as the weather
kept fine throughout, and the scoring was good on both
sides until the last S.A. innings. The four innings’ aver-
aged 260 apiece, and only two or three men on
each side failed to play up to reputation. Callaway was
again unlucky ; and the great Lyons, with 22 in the
first innings, was paralysed at 6 in the second by a
ball from M‘Kihbin. Darling played two dashing innings;
and all the N.S.W. star-bats sparkled. Given similar
weather in Melbourne, big scores may be looked for.
Giffen admitted that he knew nothing about
the ball of M’Kihbin’s, off which Kelly stumped him.
He thought the ball would break back, whereas it came
in from the leg side. Kelly kept wicket splendidly with
his right hand in the 2nd innings; his left still causing
him great pain. After Giffen and Darling went, the
match was K'Kibbin’s. He got 3 wickets in one
over ; 2 were down for 116—8 for 139.
The batting of the home side in their second
innings was the finest display that a N.S.W. team ever
made"and tiie South Australian fielding was as good ; not
a chance being missed. The bowling and fielding of
N.S.W. on the last day was also phenomenal ; and nothing
else will explain the collapse of the South Australians on
a batsman’s wicket.
. . ■ •
Three (should-be) certainties from each province
for the test-matchN.S.W., Gregory, Iredale, M'Kibbin;
Vie., H. Trott, A. E. Trott, Bruce ; S.A., Giffen, Jarvis,
Darling. .
Twenty Australian players have taken part in
one or more of the test-matches thus far. Five—Giffen,
Iredale, Gregory, H. Trott, and Darling—have played in
all four games. Darling’s total is not high, hut the other
four men have made among them a lot more runs than
Stoddart, Ward, Brown, and Brockwell—the four highest
scorers among the Englishmen. Stoddart has one, and
Brown two “not-outs.”
• * • •
The Englishmen’s chance of winning the rubber
looks less gloomy than before the Brisbane match, in
which their fielding, at any rate, was first-class. The
change of batting order between Brockwell and Maclaren
was greatly for the better, and taking one con-
sideration with another—probability of cool weather and
consequent revigoration of them all—it may not be more
than 6 to 4 against the visitors if they win the toss. That
is, presuming the choice of innings proves worth having.
Eady, the crack Tasmanian bat who was brought
over by the Melbourne club for practice, with a view to
his inclusion in the fifth test-match, played for that club
against East Melbourne (A. E. Trott’s team). He only
soored 12, and shaped very poorly while making them,
not seeming at all at home to Troll’s bowling.
Certain fascinating ladies of Armidale are said
to have been responsible for the delay which made certain
fascinated English cricketers late in reaching Brisbane for
the match against the combined team.
* * • •
The Maitland cricketers got huffed over the
selection of the Northern team against the Englishmen,
and stood out altogether.
» * * *
E. T. Smith, Lyons’ great supporter, must have
been disappointed at not seeing the latter’s big innings
against Vio. “E.T.” has been laying Jack long odds to
nothing every lime he has batted since his first failure, even
laying him good wagers in club matches. The wealthy
brewer was in Melb. on the first day of the Dc. match,
and laid Lyons A5O to nothing he would not make 50,
with £1 for every run over 50. Smith left by boat for
Hobart in the afternoon, and before he was out of the
Yana, Lyons bad made a hundred. So, although he
didn’t see it, Lyons' score cost Smith £lOO.
* * * *
Jack Lyons threw up a billet, in December, for
the cricket m itches.

It seems that the lady cricketers are not going
to sport rational dress for their Melbourne charity match.
They are to appear in skirts, cut as close to their feet as
possible, and will seem just like ordinary girls until they
happen to fall down. Then, and not till then, the disap-
pointed multitude may discover that each player, as she
gets placed in an embarrassing position, is a “new
woman ” as regards her knickerbockers.
* * ♦ f
Melb. Age cricket-reporter telegraphed from
Brisbane that Humphreys, the English slow-bowler,
would be put on to howl during the second innings of the
combined team, “ by special request of a large section of
the public.” Was this a cricket-match or a circus? Long
ago the Australians took slow-bowler Cooper to England
with them, and he was a dire failure—from his fellow-
countrymen’s point of view. Several English counties,
however, would have requested that Cooper be put on for
their matches if they had been blessed with real Austra-
lian “cheek.”
• * * »
Cricketer Jones was placed in a dilemma during
the second innings of the recent interprovinoial match in
Melbourne. Trumhle was bowling, and sent in a ball
which rose and shot into the batsman’s pocket. Jones
immediately pulled it out, and was given out forhandliug
the ball. Now, had he waited for a fieldsman to take the
ball out he would have saved his wicket, and if he had
run to the boundary and allowed one of the spectators to
remove it there seems no reason why he should not have
scored a three bye. But as the Adelaideans had no
chance, nobody seemed to worry about the decision,
which, no d n.bt, was perfectly correct. But as, according
to the rule of cricket, ho one may impede a batsman while
he runs, Jones and his mate should have gone on runnh g
till they wore their legs down to the knees. What a lark
it would have been had they gone on jog-trotting between
wickets for a couple of hours !
* » » *
The Bdllstin, in common with sundry other
journals, must take hack its hasty statement, founded on
the Englishmen’s opening match agains S.A., that
Richardson bowls no faster than Jones. He can bowl
much faster. In fact, one would hack the Surrey man to
kill a whole team before Jones had broken a couple of
legs.
* * * *
Flemington Autumn Meeting opens on Satur-
day, but the dead certain winner of the Newmarket
Handicap is not obtrusively conspicuous. It seems very
possible that several owners will ultimately make up the!
minds to go for somebody eise’s favorite and act accord-
ingly, in which case the selected candidate ought to give
the event a real good shaking. This is intended to sound
oracular. The betting-market may speak with authority
on, or before, Friday night. These lines are written in
awful ignorance of many things, including the stale of the
weather next Saturday afternoon. The weather might
“ upset all calculations." Moreover, racing calculations
are naturally so shaky that they often topple over with-
out getting upset by any thing in particular. The writer
wishes to apologise beforehand for trying to mention the
w inner of the New mark t among nine names - Bar-
barian, Bessie M'Carthy, Devon, Eiridsforde, Esau,
Eumarrah, Malolo, Vamtas and Whakawatea. If the
recent “form” at Caulfield is worth co sidering—and it
ought to be—" Bessie M‘Carthy has a great chance to do
the trick. She beat a good field handsomely over 9 fur-
longs, and she meets none of them on worse, most on
belter, terms next time. Previously Bessie had been
tried over six furlongs, and was hotly fancied by her
party for the Newmarket. Bessie’s sex is somewhat i i her
favor at this autumnal season of tire year. Devon was off
color three weeks ago, and as late as five days ago he hurt
his foot, and was eased. The foot may recover from the
injury, and the easing in his preparation may perchance
benefit the Cup runner-up, who is good enough to back
for ss. every time he starts. Whakawatea, on the
Caulfield running, has a pull over Vanitas, whilst it h
tolerably certain that this pair of fliers have a united pull
over most of the animals they will meet in the New-
market. If a 6st. 111 b. rider can make Barbarian do hit
best, and if the time-test counts, then Barbarian, judgeo
by his Oakleigh Purse performance, should beat Vanitas
and whack Whaky. Again, recent time-tests, several of
them, give Esau a show, provided he can last out six fur-
longs at top speed—a doubtful point. And this in spite
of "his defeat by Barbarian aforesaid. The Messrs.
Miller, who didn’t think seriously of Esau’s chance
a fortnight ago, are now said to like it much.
They are among the few wise, respectable owners
of these latter days. Eiridsforde was tried a much better
horse than Mostyn before winning a “no race” on Saturday.
When the “ no race ” came to be run anew, Eiridsforde
finished nowhere, but this is of no great importance,
because the Newmarket Handicap doesn’t require win
ning oftener than once a day. Eumarrah is fancied and
backed by intelligent people, and Malolo—well, there may
be a great race in this reminiscence of Malua. Only one
horse wins money for its backers, as a rule. A regretable
but solemn fact. The writer thinks that a long price
about Esau or Barbarian might be as well worth accepting
as a shorter one about Bessie M'Carthy.
The Harvester, unless he goes stale through too
much showing of wonderful gallops to the touting
fraternity, should be good enough to win the Leger. Also,
he must surely be good enough to finish first, or there-
abouts, in the' Australian Gup race. It is easy to-pro-
pheoy the defeat of a first-class horse, because he happens
to loom large in the betting, but it is hard to believe
sincerely in anything but Harvester for the 2i-mile
event. Given Devon in proper trim, and one of Mr. W.
R. Wilson’s, with plenty of stable coin on its back, and
they will seem the least unlikely to defeat the V.R.O.
Derby winner.
J * * * *
Though the St. Leger is considered a foregone
conclusion for The Harvester, Oobbity’s two recent public
gallops have done him a world of good, and he will prove a
tough customer.
* * » *
The outsiders most likely to upset the favorites
in the Newmarket Handicap are Gaillardia, Eureka, and
Liuburn ; and it is quite on the cards that the first-named
will win this important event at the third time of asking.
Last year she was very unlucky to meet two sprinters like
Hova and Bruin.
* * * *
If one of the big events is to be captured by
the N.S.W. brigade ’twill be by the aid of Donation, who
is extremely well. Ooolalta should also secure a two-year
old prize for Mr. S. Hordern.

Paris, the galloping-machine, left Sydney for
England per Thermopylae. The little wonder (in one of
whose ears, by the way, a lady has fixed a ring) goes wilh
an excellent record as a handicap horse, his victories in-

9at 21b. in the saddle ; the Caulfield Cup, 1892 and 1894,
with Bst. 81b. and 9st. 41b. resp -ctably, besides many
other meritorious performances. When he has finished
racing, he is to return and end his days at Havilah, his
owner’s station.

A son of Jack Thompson, the deceased book-
maker of that name —he was a man among men, was Jack
Thompson—will come to Australia with Terry. Here is
a story about Jack. Meeting in the street one day a
friend who was out of luck, he noticed—ominous sign!—
that the latter’s watch and chain were gone. “Look
here,” said Jack, who happened to know that the watch
had been sold and taken out of the country, “perhaps
you know more about watches than I do—l am going to
make a friend a present, and want you to help me select
it.” The pair walked into Flavelle’s, and Jack’s out-
ofluck friend approved of a watch and chain, value £6O.
“Now,” said Jack, when they got into the street, “you
must accept this from me. It doesn't do to look as if you
were going down in the world, old man.”

Owners of really first-class colts are too prone
to race thtm off their legs as youngsters ; they, therefore,
either lose their form, turn rogue, or break down, and
thus the gnat w.f.a. races are robbed of the interest
caused by the meeting of real cracks. Tis the old story
of “survival of the fittest.” Carbine’s iron constitution
and limbs pulled him through, as did Portsea’s ; but
Dreadnought, Strathmore, Camoola and Carnage are
melancholy examples of this suicidal policy,

Would it not be as well to have a proof-house

The third edition of the pamphlet on
Sharp’s new Cannalin remedies for piles is now
ready—free copies on application to the depot for
Australasia, 257 George-street, Sydney. Note.—
These remedies have cured where operation and
all other means have failed.*
Herr Rassmussen, the well-known Danish
herbalist, has just returned from a visit to Tas-
mania, where his Alfaline Remedies have now a
large sale, as they have, indeed, throughout all
Australia as well as other parts of the world. The
success of Herr Rissmussen’S business is more
than remarkable. It is seldom indeed that an
affair of the kind has attained to such dimensions
in the comparatively short space of ten years.
The result achieved is largely owing to the fact
that he travels on the safe system of representing
himself to be simply what he is—a purely self-
taught herbalist and botanist. He does not
assume the rdle of a doctor, but merely professes
to manufacture pills and powders from recognised
and harmless herbal formulas, and his Alfaline
Remedies are without doubt the most popular
herbal remedies in these provinces.
Sands’ Sydney Directory for 1895 is to
hand. It has been compiled in the usual pains-
taking fashion, and in the matter of completeness
and accuracy it can compare on even terms with
anything else of its kind in this imperfect world.
In addition to the alphabetical directory, street
directory, and directory of trades and professions,
it contains a list of leading European manufac-
turers, particulars concerning all Government
Departments, list of M.’sP., naval and military
lists, particulars of customs and excise duties,
wharfage rates, a list of firms with fixed pay-days,
&e., &c. The information is well up to date, is
clearly printed, and well-arranged, and though no
special effort has been made to write it up in a
light or humorous spirit, and the work contains
no specially eloquent passages, its value is bevond
dispute.
The misfortunes of some are the oppor-
tunities of others. This is especially applicable
to commercial life. Crawford, King and Co., of
Melbourne, having been forced into liquidation,
are now realising their great stocks of drapery,
millinery, fancy-goods, carpets and art furnishings,
at a reduction of 20 per cent, all round. This is
the public’s opportunity. A great chance is
afforded men in the bush by the tremendous re-
duction in the tailoring and general outfitting
departments; and residents of remote regions in
any part of Australia may write to this great out-
fitting house, and order what they want from
price-lists and patterns, which are mailed on appli-
cation. Cheques or P.O. orders may be sent with
orders. An opportunity like this does not occur
every day.
A. feature of the last test-match played in
Sydney was the presentation by M. Moss and Co.
of a set of costly gold-mounted pipes to Iredale, as
consolation for his bad fortune in making the
lowest score. The enterprising agents for Wolfe’s
Schnapps naturally got a huge advertisement out
of the novel idea. Some controversy arose as to
whether a “duck” could be possibly considered
“a score,” but it was decided that the spirit of
the offer was in favor of the most unfortunate. It
is to be hoped that a similar presentation, which
is being made by the agents of Wolfe’s Schnapps
m Melbourne, will not have the effect of inducing
our boys to go out easily in the next test-match,
for, if all should make a “duck,” it will require a
15-barrelled board of arbitration, sitting 15 months
at 15 guineas a-day, to decide who is to take the
case of pipes.

all its Accumulated Funds and Assets belongs to its Policy-holders, and all the profits earned in the
Business are payable to them exclusively. Life insurance, as conducted by this Company, is not a
money-making business, but a beneficent institution, managed solely in the interest of insured mem-

cost of conducting the business.
This Company is placed under State Supervision, and the scope of its business and the character
of its investments are restricted by statute limitations. Under the provisions of the Statutes of the
State of New York, the Company can only invest its funds in (1) Real Estate owned, (2) Bond and

When buying The Bulletin at any wharf
or railway-station, make sure, before paying,
that you get the current issue, as a number of
people have been making money by trading off
ancient copies on the unsuspecting.
The Anti-Chinese Vegetable Supply Com-
pany has been instituted for the purpose of estab-
lishing vegetable culture upon sanitary and
modern methods, and also to organise a systematic
daily supply to consumers residing in Sydney and
suburbs. Particulars will be supplied on appli-
cation to the Secretary, Equitable Buildings,
George-st., Sydney.
Rev. F, B. Boyce, the well-known Cold
Tea crank, writes to Sydney Telegraph to point
out that the <£4,000,000 spent in one year for the
N.S.W. drink-bill “ would allow a bright sovereign
to be put on every one of the letters of the Bible.”
The Bulletin regretfully contradicts Mr. Boyce.
Even a billion sovereigns wouldn’t allow one to be
put on each letter for a large number of reasons.
First, the letters are too close together, and one
sovereign would cover forty of them. Second, no
man can balance sovereigns on both sides of a
sheet of paper. Third, even if Mr. Boyce could
put a sovereign on each letter, by the time he had
fixed up the first six leaves of Genesis in this

anyhow ; <£4,000,000, while it remains on a
Bible, does no more good to anybody than
a dead ’possum on a fence. Fifth, is' there
any more sense, or poetry, or sentiment in
putting one sovereign on each letter of the Bible
than in putting one hard-boiled egg on a tomb-
stone? Also, whose Bible are they to be put on,
and who is to be trusted with the job of putting
them there ? The Bulletin requests Rev. F. B.
Boyce to think seriously over these things and
supply further details of his scheme.
“Merrie England” is a book reprinted
from the Clarion —a socialistic newspaper which
The Bulletin has had to strike from its exchange-
hrec because of the remarkable consistency with
which it socialistically scissored columns of Bul-
letin matter without acknowledgment. “ Merrie
England” is devoted to an explanation of the
principles which justify this sort of thing, and is,
in several respects, a remarkable book. It con-
tains 204 pages, sold for Id., and 500,000 copies
have already been disposed of—a unique publish-
ing achievement. The book is ably written, and
is calculated to do good ; though, as usual, it
deals only with the destructive side of Socialism
—showing the Hell of the present state of
things, contrasting it with the H iaven of ideal
socialism, and carefully omitting to build a bridge
by which erring humanity may get from this hell
to that Heaven. A sample fallacy may be quoted
(p. 61): “ Man has a right only to what his labor
makes. No man ‘ makes ’ the land.” Therefore,
no man has a right to own land, even if he earns
by his labor money to purchase it from the com-
munity. This, in the first place, begs the question
—Why has a man not a right to the gift of
another man who has earned the gift by labor ?
Then there is a quibble on the word “ makes.”
Plainly, a man has a right to what his labor makes,
or its equivalent. If he chooses to exchange his
labor for land, and the community chooses to ex-
change land for his labor, he has a right to the
land which represents the fruit of his labor.
(Whether it is judicious of the community to sell
the land is another question.) There are scores of
similar errors in the book, as well as much pithy
reasoning and pointed declamation.
“The time for being ashamed of poverty
was last century, not this.”— SPECTATOR.
Despite the reputedly bird times all over
Australia, the vendors of an anti-fat mixture assert
that there was never so great a demand for their
wares as at present. Perhaps Fatman is getting
ready to hustle.
“ Politics are a field where action is one
long second best, and where the choice constantly
lies between two blunders.”—John Morley.

Dear Sir, —I think it my duty to inform you

pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have

Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from General Debility of the
Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the
leading doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne,
I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and
the uniform patience with which you have
treated me, allow me to say that you can
ma,ke what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,

Pack & Riding Camels of the best Breed,
From
KHARAN,
BELUCHISTAN, and
AFGHANISTAN.
Most reliable for carrying and travelling purposes,
unsurpassed by any hitherto imported from India
—real beauties.
These camels are now at Lime Cliff Paddock,
about 2J miles from Subiaco and 3 miles from
Claremont, where they will remain for three
weeks to undergo the necessary quarantine regu-
lations.
They are undergoing one month’s quarantine,
during which period they will be fed on good,
strengthening food, and no expense will be spared.
These are not Calcutta camels—or, rather, those
that are known as such—but the real Hill breed ;
accustomed to feed on bushes and grass identical
with those of Western Australia; as only used by
the Army Commissariat Department of India,
consequently they can be thoroughly recom-
mended. They are directly shipped from Kurra-
chee, the nearest seaport to Kharan, Beluchistan
and Afghanistan.
The s.s. Olaverley, a first-class steamer, giving
comfortable accommodation to 400 camels, was
chartered for the special purpose of bringing from
Kurrachee these 320 camels. All these camels are
in good condition, as we have taken great trouble,
no expense having been spared by Messrs. D. and
J. Fowler on our behalf.
Diggers and Prospectors are
invited to deal at once.
All telegrams and letters should be addressed
to meat “Criterion Hotel, Perth,” until further
notice.

the East, they will by the time they leave quaran-

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word ; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in am acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years t«
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, whieh im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life ; if you are suffering from these or similapiymp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.
PRIVATE
troubles of every kind, name and nature,

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
CUBED BY USING
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. 1 tried
m
&
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers I'ceommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep
I'ke a child.” *

BLAKE PUMPS.
In addition to the original SINGLE BLAKE PUMP, we also
make two different styles of Duplex Pumps—the “ STANDARD ” or
“ REGULAR ” and the “ SPECIAL.” The “ Standard ”or “ Regular ”
Duplex Pumps are constructed with Composition Piston Rods, Stuffing
Boxes, Valve Seats, Valve Bolts and Pump Cylinder Linings. The Water
Pistons are also made of Composition, and are suitably packed with
Adjustable Fibrous Packing, adapted for Hot or Cold Liquids.
The “ Special,” although not of so high a class as our “ Standard ”
Pattern, are nevertheless well and faithfully made. They are through-
out heavier and stronger than other
makers’ pumps of same class and
selling for same price, and we
guarantee them to give thorough
satisfaction. For contractors’ work,
and where a more expensive pump
might not be justifiable, they are
specially suitable.
All parts are interchangeable,
and can therefore be readily dupli-
cated in case of accidental break-

T HE RABBIT IKT VA.SIOKT!
Melbourne Age of 12th February, 1895, published the following telegram :
Alburt, Monday.—Good evidence is forthcoming that some recent bush fires in the northern part of Riverina
have been occasioned through the ignition of the phosphorus used for rabbit poisoning. A fire which is supposed to
have originated by this means destroyed over 30,000 acres of grass.
jgp“* TOXA, the only scientific destroying specific, has no inflammable constituents. TOXA WILL NOT
IGNITE!, either spontaneously or otherwise. Horses, Cattle and Sheep WILL NOT EAT TOXA. This poison
is SAFE, EFFICACIOUS and CHEAP ; cheapness is incompatible with risk or uncertainty. Ilalf-a-crown's
worth of TOXA has poisoned 550 Rabbits. Write for particulars.

Melb. Free Library has just secured a
copy of the Ballarat Times of the day following
the Eureka Stockade fight. The paper contains
an account of the trouble, and is peculiarly in-
teresting as being the only known copy of that
day’s date, as the issue was seized by Government
and destroyed for the preservation of Her Majesty’s
peace.
The Japanese Government is nothing if
not paternal. Recently there sailed down the
Queensland coast in the Menmuir, Dr. Lavasne,
who had been delegated by Japan to visit Fiji in
order to enquire into the disease called “beri-
beri,” which is decimating the Japs, in that
island.
Ed. Bulletin, —It does not follow that
because the work at Shea’s Creek, Sydney, is
“ relief-work,” billets there are necessarily “soft.”
The men are harder worked, and have fewer
liberties than they would have if working under
private contractors. If they are caught
straightening their backs they are promptly
“sacked ; ” they are not allowed even to smoke ;
and the workman who is absent for a day is not
permitted to go on again. Further, the men are
not allowed to say whether or not it is too wet to
work; the ganger—paid by the week, rain or no
rain, work or no work—decides for them. The
Shea’s Creek mud may be soft, but the Shea’s
Creek billets aren’t.—Navvy.
Jabez Balfour hasn’t been captured after
all. His extradition was granted in due course,
but since then local friends have been instituting
a series of criminal charges against Jabez, and as
these take precedence of foreign accusations he
can’t get away until the last case is disposed
of. As each charge comes along, the eminent
saint is arrested, bailed out, examined, re-
examined, examined some more, committed for
trial, postponed several times, tried, acquitted—
and promptly re-arrested on another charge. Con-
sequently the progress of Jabez towards his beloved
mother-country is somewhat protracted.
Cabled that “a detachment of Moorish
cavalry is on the road to Fez, conveying two cart-
loads of salted heads of rebels, which are intended
to be exhibited on the walls of that city.” It
recalls the old times of Sydney, when schooners
returned from Maoriland bringing cargoes of tat-
tooed heads for exportation to Europe as curios.

Sons, Ltd., at Walkerville, Ontario, together with
an account of the lavish entertainment afforded to
the 1000 guests from all parts of the Dominion
who attended the opening festival. Absolutely
pure, with age guaranteed by the Canadian
Government, possessing an original and peculiarly
pleasing bouquet, and with a flavor quite distinct
both from that of Scotch and the Bourbon (corn)
whisky, “Canadian Club” has now hosts of
admirers in all parts of the known globe, and to-
day, it is said, has a larger sale than any other
whisky on the Continent of America.

“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than

sprayed into the throat.
“It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations, and con-

" It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from

we should never he able to

We have received from the publishers,
Messrs. Turner and Henderson, a new “School
History of Australia and Tasmania,” hy George
Thornton, lately head master of Cleveland street
(Sydney) public school. The book is, without
doubt, the best school history of Australia yet
produced. The literary style adopted is one
especially fitted for school work, and the plain
facts of history are told without any of that
bias of opinion which so often spoils an otherAise
valuable book for educational use. The history of
each province is related in turn and brought fairly
up to date. A reference index at the end com-
pletes the work, which, especially considering the
quality of the text-book now in use, should be
soon adopted by all schools, both public and
private. Perhaps a map would have somewhat
added to the value of the history.
Kaiser Wilhelm is a rash young man.
Cabled that on the monument erected in honor of
Bismarck at Gottingen, the Kaiser has ordered to
be inscribed the words, “To the Great Chan-
cellor.” Praise a fair day at night—only. As
Bismarck has not absolutely yet shed his teeth the
Kaiser may one day have to chisel out the inscrip-
tion —just as they have been chiselling the names
of the patron saints off the Coffee Palace founda-
tion-stones.
N.S.W. Ministers have ukased that no
departmental information is to be given to the
Sydney newspaper reporters until after 3 p. ra.
every day. A nice little greasing of the fat sow !
This positively knocks out of time the evening
papers, and gives the morning dailies not only a
monopoly of the fresh news, but plenty of time
during which to masticate it. Government infor-
mation supplied to an evening paper after 3 p.m.
is comparatively useless, since it can only be
printed in the late editions.
Britain has been struck by a terribly
severe winter. Many of the Scotch and North
of England railways have been blocked by snow
for weeks. There are ice-floes floating down the
Thames and other rivers; many towns have been
cut off from all communication with the outer
world ; and the temperature has fallen in places
much below zero. Britain is getting along favor-
ably towards that time of eternal frost which pro-
mises to wipe out the human race altogether.
In fact, all the world is getting along in that
same direction. Eight or ten centuries ago there
were towns and churches and bishops and a moder-
ately prosperous population in Greenland —now
there are only ice and desolation and a few Eskimo,
The vine grew luxuriantly in the North of France
in the 13th century ; and now it has moved South,
and in a few more centuries it will probably
move out of France altogether. The science
of meteorology is so new that there is a
great want of accurate data on the subj-ot, but
there seems little reason to doubt that the freezing
process is getting along steadily. No doubt a
time will come when Melbourne and Sydney will
be frozen out, and the last Australian will shiver
miserably along the shores of the Batavia River,
and look out from his snow hut on the ice-floes in
the Gulf of Carpentaria, and watch the polar bear
digging up the frozen remnants of the second last
Australian from their burial place. All which is
quite a cheerful thing to reflect upon in the pre-
sent hot weather.

Craig, the “ Coffee Cooler,” conqueror of Ted
Pritchard, is (writes The Bulletin’s Loudon correspon-
dent) one of the best men of his inches seen for a long
time. In style he resembles my quondam teacher, Black
Perry—one of the very best fighters the world ever saw.
He has the same habit of crouching down like a oat ready
to make a spring, and, suddenly rising to his full height,
letting fly hammer-like blows right or left with equal ease
straight from the shoulder. The blow which downed
Pritchard would have done for a man three stone heavier.
It will he a good man who will take down the tan-colored
gentleman's number. It is said that D’Arcy Wentworth
lost heavily over Pritchard’s defeat. He usually follows
Jem Mace s advice, and, as 1 said some time since, the
Gipsy is about as bad a judge of glove-fighters as we
have,
I just now spoke of Black Perry as having been
one of the best men the woild ever saw in a ring. I
am confirmed in this opinion by an old gentleman
who remembers him in his hey-day in England,
and who says that for style, agility, and strength
he did not have his equal amongst the giants of
40 to 50 years ago, and he knew them all and found
stakes for a good many. The late W. M. Arnold (Monte
Arnold's father) who was very fond of the game, told me
that he never in his life saw two such blows struck as
those with which Perry floored Hough and Keene. I want
no better or more experienced authority. 1 think Colonel
M‘Donald is of my opinion as to the darkie’s ability. By
the way, there was an error in a paragraph about Perry’s
death in The Bulletin some time ago. The poor fellow
died literally in the gutter, down Sussex-street way, in
Sydney. What a wreck he was 1
I wonder whether Harry Stuckey, of Goulburn,
recollects when Perry held Cahill's place at the Run of
Water on the Yass Road in a state of siege, he being in a
fit of D.T. ? The writer managed to quiet him, and for a
week or two Stuckey and others used to go over and box
with the darkie, bringing much grist to Cahill’s mill.

Re the statement in a “home” paper that a
well-known Australian pugilist can’t get backers, and has
only himself to blame for the fact, a Melb. sporting boni-
face tells the following. “ You know I backed when
he was hi re and helped him in many ways. When I went
to England I called at the National Sporting Club to see
him. There he was in plug hat, frock coat, tan boots and
stick. His head bad swollen fearfully. He spoke with a
drawl, and was surrounded by elaborately-dressed fashion-
ables. ‘How do you do, Billy?’ (Billy isn’t his name,
but it will do) said I. Without a word he hurried me
oulside and then whispered—“ You 1 If you call me
Billy in front of my friends, I’ll drive my blanky fist
through you. Call me Mister .’ But I had my
revenge. I laid the other pug. 200 to 1 that he couldn’t
down Mr. Billy Blank, and it was the sweetest money I
ever paid away.

Awhile ago some practical jokers sent a negro
corn-doctor to the residence of George Hill, the well-
known Sydney sport, who, the nig. was told, was much
afflicied with bunions. Mr. Hill wasn’t in on the nig.’s
first visit, nor at his second, nor third, but still the
darkey continued his visits. Presently Hill, who had
been told about it, met the colored gentleman in a town
hostelry. “Look here,” said G.H., cheerily, “if you
infest my place any more I’ll have to punch you.” The
darkey said not a word, but walked over to a heavy table
in the corner, took it up with his teeth and eloquently
Wftirjfled it in the air. Then he put it down very gently*
Mr. Hill, he said, “ I used to get my living as strong
man in a circus.” G. Hill smiled.

As prize-fighters are generally nob noted for
brains, it is perhaps not very strange that none of the
regular pugs, ever succeeded here as bookmakers. Mace
Burke, Slavin, Goddard, Hicken, and ihe rest, all tried it
—in vain. Save Mick Nathan and Foley none have
made a do” as liquor-sellers. Bookies rise, as a rule
from flsh-hawking, and publicans from ex-polioeraen.

The Democratic Club is now “the only live
sporting club ”in Melb. The ball is kept rolling every
night. The subscription is small and the beer cheap—
twopence (or a long one. Sunday is the great day,
Ladies are admitted,” and a variety entertainment is
given—smging, drinking, dancing and glove-fighting
{alias ‘ scientific boxing ”) being the principal varieties.
Gore enough is spilt to satisfy the most sanguinary— a
niop and bucket have been added to the usual ring
utensils. The New Woman says it is all splendid.

How comes it, enquires a Bulletin correspon-
dent, that such masters and teachers of the noble art as
Christie (Mace’s best pupil), Dooley, Choynski, Dawson,
Lees, Hall, and others—have all gone down to rushers,
who, broadly speaking, “ never took a lesson ’’—like Jack
Thompson, Goddard, Farnan, Slavin, and so on ?

“ Give a dog,” &c. Pngs, will tell you that a
certain Supreme Court Judge still goes (incognito) to the

enquired of a gentleman with a broken nose. “ Oh,” was
the cool reply, •• that is his Honor Mr. Justice .”

Lord Coventry is the Chairman of a Sporting
League, formed to preserve the ‘‘interests of sport” from
tiie attacks of the Anti-Gambling Parly. Lord Coventry
says:—“l have come into contact with different classes
of race frequenters, and have been greatly impressed by
the keen sense of honor possessed by the vast majority of
supporters of the turf.” Which somehow reminds Thb
Bulletin that bookmaker Sutton once came into contact
with the nose of Lord Coventry’s son and heir (Deer-
hurst) in a Melbourne pub. through the latter not having
(it was alleged) paid his debt of honor.

A photo,, full of unconscious humor, adorns the
vestibule at Barron’s studio, Melb. It is a very artistic
group of four young men, two of them seated at a con-
ference-table, and the other two watching their solemn
proceedings from a couch. One of the couched young
men has a large document spread over his knee, and the
picture altogether suggests four heroes planning a Polar
expedition, or drawing up an international treaty. No
subject would be too large for it. The inscription is
“The Founders of the League of Victorian Wheelmen.”
The work should possess a great historic value in ages to
come.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Why do jumping- horses last
so much longer than flat-racers ? ” Because the flat-racer
is simply a light galloping-machine, only fit to carry a
small weight over a comparatively short course. His
exertions while running probably come very close to the
limit of his capacity. The steeplechaser, on the
other hand, is generally a big, staunch horse, with a
reserve of unexpended force which remains long after the
feebler flat-racer has lost vigor and elasticity. In short,
the steeple-chaser lasts longer, bar accidents, than the
flat-racer because he is so much relatively stronger to
begin with.—R.

At the ’B7 M.L. Cup meeting, an agitated specu-
lator rushed up to his partner and exclaimed: “We’ve
hacked the wrong one!” “How do you know?”
“ Vogel’s backed Spade Guinea ! ” That settled it. Off
they rushed, and put a fiver on S.G., who won, and paid
over £l3 div. Such was the average Maorilander’s faith
in the “great financier.”

In America, if a racehorse-owner wishes to
scratch his horse he sends word to the racing club stating
his reasons. If the club is suspicious the vet. is sent along
and if the animal is well it runs. If a horse is getting
knocked about in the betting the club’s retained jock, is
put up at the last moment and the biter is bitten. Some-
thing like this is badly needed in Australia.

An official who ought to know assorts that the profits of

Marie Luella looks superbly handsome in “Cinderella,”
at Melh. Princess’s, in which she wears a black suit, cut
very low at the neck, and a cloak lined wiili white.
This dress, with black tights, suits the figure of the
beauteous Marie to perfeoiion. The black tights have,
however, one disadvantage, or otherwise. Towards the
end of a hot evening, they give most unmistakeable
evidence that beneath them there stands a pair of legs,
covered with a gleaming ivory skin. The gleam through
the black is not to be overlooked. At all events, it isn’t
overlooked.
A well-informed Australian theatric quidnunc insists
that Brooke served, as a stock actor, under Maoready, It
is established by an entry in Maoready’s journal,
“Reproved Mr. Brooke.” The current idea is this:
engaged Brooke, and posted a cast of
“Hamlet,” in the Drury Lane green-room, with “Ghost,
Mr. Brooke.” Brooke drew his pencil through it, and
wrote to Maoready: “In ‘ Hamlet,’ I never play anything
but the Prince.” After that, they never met.
A decidedly “ low” comedian distinguished himself at
a northern theatre lately, by the effusive way he
made love on the stage to the ingenue of the co. The
man had vine-leaves in his hair, and Bacchus prompted
fervent demonstrations towards Venus. There might have
been a row about it, except that the lady was advised
that the fellow didn’t know much belter, and that it was
better to take a stage insult quietly than to make a fuss.
The nett profit of the steam merry-go-round at St.
Hilda beach for Deo. and Jan. was £6Ol 11s. Now the

Clever Henrietta Watson, of the beauteous throat, was
snapped up in London. She has, it is cabled, played
with much success the leading feminine role in Ralph
Lumley’s new comedy at Toole’s theatre.
The shapely Sophie Harris, who is playing principal boy
in the London Crystal Palace Panto., confides to a press-
man that her ambition was to show her legs in Hingland
“because my parents were English."
“Larynx” wants to know how Australian impresarios
are to look up the fresh, young voices of the bush, as sug-
gested by The Bulletin's correspondent, “ Kookaburra."
No doubt R. S. Smythe, for instance, would like to hear a
few; but, perhaps, his opinion of “ the lovely voice
belonging to a young bush-girl” would not quite coincide
with “ Kookaburra’s.” Besides, a good voice needs no
bush. A girl with a really phenomenal voice is soon
heard of ; but the loveliest voice is of no use to a manager
until months or years have been spent in its cultivation.
Actor George Cnppin will be 75 in April. His most

At a recent entertainment the spring-heeled Yar-
mouth and Miss Green, as the Moth and Candle,
respectively, badly hashed their exit. The lady slipped
and fell just at the wings, and her insect pursuer, looking
like a daddy longlegs masquerading in wings, tumbled
headlong over her. There lay both performers, giddy
and dazed ; the spectacle suggesting the death-throes of a
tarantula, rather than the finale of a conventional terp-
sichorean duet.
Madame Pasta (Mrs. Moore) has started afternoon
dancing classes, at Melb. Royal, in rivalry of Madame
Philipini, Mrs. Royce's successor, at the Princess’.
At the recent annual dinner of the Presbyterian Union
in New York there was a little music and singing just to
please the ladies. The elder appointed to direct this new
departure had heard that Rice’s burlesque co. contained
some cheerful vocalists, so he engaged one of the male
persons to come and sing three songs, “not necessarily
of a frivolous nature,” in a long, black frock-coat. This
mundane stranger appeared as per contract before the
peechmaking began and started off with “ Linger Longer
Loo.” Then he warbled a story of a parrot that advised
a young man to kiss his girl, and exhorted him to ‘‘Sneak
oat ” when the old man was coming. The Moderator
sent a message to the man of sin and melody, begging
him “to make his last song more suitable to the occa-
sion.” Result, an awful ditty about a giil who left her
native village in a state of Innocence, but came back with
a naughty, twinkling eye. One verse of this brought the
Presbyterian Union to its feet. The vocalist was requested
to retire, and the Moderator proposed the health of the
Dutch Reformed Church.
Sunt Stead in his Christmas Number of the Review of
Review thus touches up Mrs. :~“Seated alone in
the carriage, half buried in luxurious furs, sat Mrs. Long-
ton, one of the most notorious of courtesans of the Vic-
torian era. Wilkes recognised her in a moment. He had
seen her on the stage, where she posed but could not act,
and her well-known face, with the smooth regularity of
its features, and the absolute lack of any expression other
than that of a somewhat stupid sheep, enabled him to
identify at once the harpy who, having battened on the
lives and fortunes of many lovers, was now hastening
with her gains from the last man who had called her mis-
tress. These were her boxes, which were going away, and
with her in the carriage she had her jewel-case. She had
taken good care to stow away every precious stone the
late Earl had ever placed within her reach. There was no
trace of emotion upon that wooden and impassive face,
as little as there was of passion in its owner, for Mrs.
Longton was one of those women who, from the very lack
of all feeling, seemed the better able to play the fatal
game of rousing the passions of those whom they seek to
plunder.” But if a certain amateur bruiser, who lately
died, happened to be alive just now it is probable Saint
Stead wouldn’t write any more Christmas Numbers.
Dear Bulletin,— Surely some of your contributors are
inventing fancy brands of dramatic critics. The theatri-
cal n dice-writer, as I know him, can laugh more heartily
at a joke, even a bad joke, than the average first-night
patron, or amateur critic. As regards ins scat —well, he
often stands at the back of the dress-circle rather than
cost the management five shillings. It is only the very
young, or very old, notice-writer who seems to get him-
self up for the part and disdain to smile or applaud. The
very old one is fast dying out, and his juvenile brother
generally gets wiped out ere he has time to ripen. But
there is the casual, or imitation critic, who must not be
overlooked. He is a person of various ages, who assumes
a Guy Fawkes air, and takes a lot of notes in a secret
manner when he hopes that everyone is looking. — One
Who Has Been There.
Some of Macdonald’s topical lines in “Cinderella," are
happy specimens of “wholesome fun.” Mac., a bit of a
naturalist and prose poet, is a wholesomely funny man,
and, as Mr. Sparkler, of “Little Dorritt,” would have
said, there’s no biggod nonsense about him.
Young W. Percjr, of the Pollard juveniles, is a most
promising and versatile actor. Such widely diveise
characters as Ali Baba, Tambour Major, and t.he Duke in
“ O ivette ”he handles equally well. For the pantomime,
produced at Wellington (M.L.) Opera House, Percy painted
a portion of the scenery. He is making greai strides in
this branch of the profession ; a fact which will gratify
those scenio artists who have unselfishly assisted the
clever young Australian.
The Girl of Yarmouth behaved handsomely re his
skirt-dancing antics in Melbourne. Not only were there
champagne luncheons at rehearsals, but after the show
the Girl gave all the professionals souvenirs, in the form
of gold bangles or matchboxes, or something of the kind.
Miss Florence West (a sister-in-law of critic Chmei t
Scott) wears a most extraordinary dress in Oscar Wilde’s
new play, “An Ideal Husband.” It is of grass-green sill ,
studded with the stuffed bodies of many blackbirds wilh
outstretched wings. Florence West is a woman with the
most exquisite auburn hair. No doubt the dress suits her
perfectly, but the killing of many of the sweetest of
British country song-birds to bedizen the frock of a mum-
mer is real wickedness.

The Aftermath.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After all, looking back at it now, was it
worth while? Now that we know the cost, then
uncounted, or only lightly thought of at the
best, now that the glamour of the unseen future has
been followed by the certainties of the dead past,
now that we have known and enjoyed and suffered.
The ink is already faint on the first half-blotted
prayer of the book. The sowing was not of yes-
terday nor the reaping of to-day, but the harvest
has been gathered to the full. Fiercest passion
has had its say—let ooldest reason ask again : Was
it worth while?
Do you remember the first outspoken word
that came like a flash, laying hare our hearts
and lighting up the abyss into which we were drift-
ing blindly—only that with a little struggle we
might fall in it—seeing ? Do you remember that
night after all that has happened since? A dark,
sultry night, with a hot wind lazily puffing across
the Arabian sands. The lights of Ismailia shin-
ing-in the distance as we came towards them, and
a French boat, mail-carrying and homeward
bound, glided by, important, a dozen tourists
crowded amidships noisily, ready to disembark.
On the after-deck we leaned across the bulwarks,
and I made up my mind that I must tell you
then. Tell you and finish with the dream for
once and all. For it could only be a dream ; two
short weeks of folly— and the end. And yet it
was hard to tell. Hard to tell and go ; harder
still to tell and yet be forced to stay. To fight the
battle out in sight of one another, walking the
same deck day after day, friends perhaps only,
perhaps not even that. It was hard.
Morton it was who forced me to it at last. You
remember Morton ?—the fool of the ship. He
came to us as we stood there to confide his latest
misery. He had fallen in love—for the second
time in a fortnight—and that was his misfortune,
for he had no business to fall in love, and, there-
fore, he was miserable, and must needs tell his
misery aloud. As he left us you were about to
P “ Don’t call him a fool!” I said. “ He probably
is, but he is not the only fool.” And then, as you
looked wonderingly :
“ I have done the same as he has,” I added.
You understood me. In one flash of the eyes I
saw that you understood me as you turned away
and I leaned over the bulwarks—alone. The dark
water was gleaming with the reflection of a
thousand lights which were all dancing and
blurred as I looked down upon them, and the
departing ones were shouting words of farewell as
the great ship got lazily under weigh again. From
the shore could be heard the monotonous “ ’ Ave a
ride, ’ave a ride!” of the Arab donkey-boys, and
the ship’s oomic-singer was making night hideous
in the smoking-room. Five years ago, but it is
all as yesterday—and then I felt a touch and
hardly heard a whisper.
“Tell me !”
Tell you ! What was there to tell when the one
fact had been told ? There are tilings that will
not bear telling. Records of folly and misery.
Who can understand them but those to whom
they have happened ? Life goes on, and the sum
of its happiness or otherwise is measured by the
feelings of him who lives it. To no other can it
ever be fully known. It is best to say nothing,
for the world will never understand. The repen-
tance at leisure, which may mean for a lifetime
and perhaps eternity as well, must be worked out
by oneself, for silence may sometimes be forgiven,
but garrulity never. And so, in one word, I had
told you all that should have separated us for
ever.
And yet we were to be friends—for so you
wished it—friends or fools ? Four weeks’ friend-
ship, and all the days to call our own, and then
the parting—North and South.
# # •
It was a year before I turned South again
and met you—A year, and yet we had not for-
gotten. Friends still—but that was a fool’s talk
where love was. For the old love had lasted and
was still to last ; why should we kill it because it
was not cut in the pattern that the world cuts it —
in some parts—the world looking keenly with
grim, narrow eyes at this and blinking them
blindly at that in its stupid, dullard’s fashion.
Was it to make a shuttle of our lives, twisting and
turning them all ways but the one which made
them to be endured, shutting out the only ray of
sunshine which illumined the short, fitful, uncer-
tain phantasmagoria that we call existence? For
this is true : That by the world one cannot be
judged but by the end only. Could we bear all,
then we were right, otherwise not. So we reasoned
and let the world go by.
# * *
The years have passed since then, each
bearing its fruit, good or evil, and now we can
ask ; Was it not worth while ? A thousand times,
ten thousand times worth while. It has been hard
and more than hard, after bitter pain and but few
gleams of outer brightness, and yet you have
never faltered. Steadfast always we can look
back without regret even if that which is coming
is as bad as that which is gone. So is it ten
thousand times worth while. The first budding
in the spring may look bright and fruitful, but it
is only in the aftermath that it can be fully
known.

Lord Oxford died the other day, full of
years and sin. He was a bad, humorous old man,
with lots of money and a weakness for spending
it just as he pleased. For a time he kept a number
of racehorses, almost as bad as himself, and it
was his humor to shout, “ Lord Oxford wins 1
Lord Oxford wins ! ” when one of them happened
to be running in a race. When it came to the
finish he would correctly judge the situation by
saying, “D—n Lord Oxford! he’s last again.”
But he tired of this form of sport when he could
find no more pleasure in watching the fools who
meant to break the “ ring.”
Gilbert Island Kanakas recently landed in
Bundaberg by the May, are a cultured lot.
Catholics all—educated by missionaries. Most
speak English fairly well, and one or two have a
smattering of French. The other day, in the
same (Bundaberg) district the Kanakas (newly
arrived) struck, demanding a new shirt and pair
of pants weekly.
Thus Zangwill, in a recent Idler, on the
“ Abolition of Money,” advocating a return to the
old system of barter
At one sweep were swept away all the monstrous credit
system which had created an army of accountants and a
Court of Bankruptcy ; all the chaos of single and double
faced entry—all the sleight-of-hand abracadabra of signa-
tures—all those paper phantoms of capital. The Stock
Exchange and other gambling-hells shrivelled up. There
was a vast saving ®f clerical labor, and there wore few
loopholes for fraud. Everything was too simple. Swift
retribution' overtook the man who shirked his obligations
to his fellows; Nobody could juggle with bits of paper at
the North Pole and ruin people at the South. The win-
dows of society were cleared of the gigantic complex cob-
W'eb full of dead flies. One could look inside and see what
was going on. “Genllemen” could not flourish in the
light. They were like the fungi that grew' in cellars.
Every man became a worker and a trader.

Millionaire Astor (comparative of Ass),
who lately bought Pall Mall Gazette, and who
left the land of Uncle Sam to wriggle wormily on
hi,s stomach in the presence of the English Court,
has, in the Christmas number of his Pall Mall
Magazine, the following disgusting crawl re two
portraits of the Empress Frederick :
In Venetian costume, radiant with full perfection of
womanly beauty and dignity, she looks most natural and
graceful, holding in her shapely hands a jewelled fan. In
the latt r full-length portrait of the illustrious couple,
dated 1885, the Princess rests one arm lightly on a chair,
while with the other she holds back her magnificent train.
The famsus necklet of pearls accentuates, but can hardly
add to, her personal attractions.
so on. All the princes are Apollos, and the
princesses Junes. Describing the marriage of
Queen Victoria, the Pall Mall Mag. says :
At that point in the service where the “ Wilt thou?”
asked awaits reply, Her Majesty pronounced the assenting
words in accents full of music and softness, yet distinctly
audible throughout the sacred building, and the eonHding
look with which she accompanied her promise, to “ love,
cherish, and to obey,” was, beyond expression, ehaste and
beautiful.

Love v. Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Time, thou ancient laggard,
Mend that wretched pace :
But two se’nnights stagger’d
Of thy long-drawn race,
Since last these eyes beheld my lady’s face !
Thou art limping, halting
On thy scraggy thigh,
Who wert went go vaulting,
Leaping, rushing by,
In stolen moments when ray Love was nigh.
Sure, thy bones are rotten :
All the fancies fair
Of thy youth Forgotten : •
Nothing dost thou care
That ray long-lingering steps are my despair.
Shake thyself, and shoulder
That worn scythe of thine :
Think, one waxes older
While the sand so fine
Runs through thy glass its slow and silent line
What, thou grizzled warlock,
Must I in despite
Drag thee by the forelock,
Urge thy tardy flight,
From dark to dawning and from morn to night ‘
Envious, narrow-spited,
Well m.esearns that thou
Hugg’st thyself, delighted
But to watch me now,
With arms enfolded and impatient brow.
Thou, with scornful pity,
Hast beheld the while
Many a bygone city
Crumbled in thy smile :
And, eareless, clad with moss the ruined aisle :
So ! But heed my warning,
Con this sentence o’er—
Thou art but as morning-
Tide on boundless shore :
But Love shall live and love for evermore.
