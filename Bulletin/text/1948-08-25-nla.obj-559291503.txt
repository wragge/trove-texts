SCOTLAND'S FORTH BRIDGE, A SYMPHONY IN STEEL
r pHE Firth of Forth is spanned at Queensferry by the famous
Forth Bridge, one of the engineering wonders of the world.
This gigantic structure is used exclusively for railway traffic, and
was built between 1882 and 1890 on the cantilever system, with
three massive steel from each of which extends an arm on
both sides to meet the arm of its neighbour or the approach viaduct
as the case may be. To get an adequate conception of this huge
yet graceful bridge, it must be viewed from below, and preferably
when an apparently toy train is seen crossing the gigantic network
of girders, as in the above picture.
There are two main spans of 1710 feet each, and two side
spans of 689| feet, its total length, including its approaches, being
If miles. The top of the bridge is 361 feet above high-water level,
and the headway under each span is 150 feet. In its construction
54,000 tons of steel were used, million rivets, and it was built
by 5000 men at a cost of nearly £3,000,000. The painted surface
covers an area of 135 acres, and its annual cost of maintenance is
about £5OOO. The engineer of the bridge was Sir John Fowler,
assisted by Sir Benjamin Baker, with Sir William Arrol as con-
tractor.
The islet seen in mid-channel, which affords a stepping-stone
for the bridge, is named Inchgarvie, on which a fort was originally
built in 1491. After resisting Cromwell in 1650, it was restored in
1779 to guard against the threatened raids of Paul Jones, the
American privateer.

COLLECTOR'S PIECE.
Though Across the Years, printed by
John Gartner at the Hawthorn Press and
published by N. H. Seward Pty., Ltd., in
a limited edition of 650 copies, is ob-
viously not intended for general reading
there is much in it that would interest a
wider audience than the collectors of
Austraiiana for whom it has been made.
There is, for instance, in an essay on the
Commonwealth National Library by
Kenneth Binns, a reference to We Were
the Rats : —
To show that the [Whelan] collection is
much more than one of autographed copies,
many items have notes of considerable
literary importance, as, for example, We of
the Never Never, which contains the later
history of the main characters, and Lawson
Glassop’s note, in We Were the Rats, that
he was not in Tobruk, but obtained the
details for that section from the “Rats”
when they came to Cairo on leave.
There is a peculiar poignance about
this friendly note, for Mr. Binns is a
member of the Literature Censorship
Board, which, alas! had no official interest
in the New South Wales legal proceed-
ings under which We Were the Rats was
declared “obscene. 15 Mr. Glassop may
reflect sadly that, had the Literature
Censorship Board or a similar body been
permitted to adjudicate on his novel, as
The Bulletin has' advocated, it is ex-
tremely unlikely that he would have
been banned. He may comfort himself
with the knowledge that, partly as a re-
sult of the prosecution, which caused his
merits to be recognised, We Were the
Rats seems already to be regarded as an
Australian classic.
Though Kenneth Binns also mentions
that negotiations have been completed for
the purchase by the National Library of
the original manuscript of The Fortunes
of Richard Mahony, the Hawthorn Press
book does not often deal with matters so
close to the present day. Its interest is
historical, bibliographical, antiquarian.
Edited by Charles Barrett and sub-titled
“The Lure of Early Australian Books,” it
is a collection of essays by various ex-
perts, surveying, in the total, the whole
field of Australian book-collecting.
Phyllis Mander Jones deals with Syd-
ney’s Mitchell Library, and, in one page
which gives some idea of the range of
that noble institution, mentions that the
library has a group of papers connected
with Robert Louis Stevenson, that it has
recently acquired a collection of Tom
Roberts’s letters and that “Chinese”
Morrison had bequeathed to it his in-
valuable diaries and papers,
Kenneth Binns covers the Common-
wealth Library and records, besides what
has already been mentioned, that it holds
the complete collection of Daisy Bates’s
notes on the aboriginals and a full record
m diaries and log-books of the flights of
Ross and Keith Smith, Cobham, Kings-
ford Smith and Charles Ulm.
' C. A. McCallum writes on the Vic-
torian Historical Collection at Melbourne
Public Library, with a note on the
pathetic “five little slips of paper, tom
from Burke’s fieldbook, on which he pen-
cilled his last notes as he lay dying under a
tree on the arid bank of Cooper’s
Creek.”
E. Morris Miller, discussing “The
Early Tasmanian Press and Its Writers,”
records that Evan Henry Thomas, editor
of the “Hobart Town Gazette” in 1824,
published at Launceston the first drama
to be wholly written and printed in Aus-
tralia —“The Bandit of the Rhine,” staged
at Launceston in 1835. Morris Miller
adds that, though Thomas’s melodrama
came first in order of publication, “the
first play on an Australian theme,
originated in Australia, was David
Burns’s ‘The Bushrangers,’ produced at
the Caledonian Theatre, Edinburgh in
1829... . the MS. of which, in a Revised
form, is in the possession of the Mitchell
Library,”
Clive Turnbull continues the Tas-
manian section with a note on “Van Die-
men’s Land for the Collector,” in which
he mentions, with some justifiable
asperity, the famous Van Diemen’s Land
Pickwick, “published by Henry Dowl-
ing, Of Launceston y with a celerity that
would have done credit to an American
pirate.
Edward E. Pescott, on “Victoriana ”
mentions- among “poetic rarities” Thomas
Bracken’s The Haunted Vale, published
at Bendigo before he went to New Zea-
land to be—as many a poet has been be-
fore and since—“not understood.”
Surveying “Northern Australian His-
tory in Early Books,” E. M, Christie dis-
cusses Carron’s narrative of the Kennedy
expedition, a poem on which by John
Blight was v recently published in The
Bulletin. Malcolm Uren reviews’ news-
paper feuds and seafaring adventures
connected with Westralia. Charles
Barrett- deals with “The Blackfellow in
Books,” which gives him occasion to
quote Dampier’s extremely discourteous
opinions and to mention an earlier
Namatjira—-Tommy McCrae, the abo-
riginal artist whose drawings decorated
Mrs. Parker’s Australian ♦Legendary
Tales published in 1897.
Gilbert P. Whitely, on “Early
Naturalists,” notes that Bligh gathered
seashells for his wife, the collection being
auctioned at Co vent Garden in 1822, and
also that in Lewin’s Birds of New Hol-
land (1808) it is remarked of the cros-
beak, “The male has a pleasant song, and
is subject to fits.”
James Tyrrell contributes “My Book-
shop Memories,” with anecdotes of Law-
son and Archibald of The Bulletin and
George Robertson and Fred Wymark of
Angus and Robertson, and with some in-
teresting glimpses of his association with
Mitchell of the Mitchell Library, who
bought a long-desired first edition of
Barron Field’s First Fruits of Australian
Poetry on the day of his death and died
with the book in his hand.
Travers Borrow, in “A Collector Looks
at Collecting,” completes the geographi-
cal and historical survey of the continent
by bringing South Australia into the pic-
ture; and—a pity he did not live to see
his: essay in print—Robert Croll ends the
volume with “The Bookplate and Aus-
tralia.”
Interesting and authoritative as all
these articles are, they are not, of course,
the kind of original historical material
which the contributors themselves would
customarily treasure as rarities. Across
the Years is' a collector’s piece in a
special and unusual sense of the term.
The limited edition is clearly printed on
good paper; it is firmly bound in a blue
cloth with silver lettering on the spine;
it contains one lovely color-plate—oddly
surrealistic in style—from the New South
Wales supplement to Orme’s Foreign
Field Sports and a number of black-and-
whites', including a photograph of the
Hartog-Vlamingh Plate, a facsimile re-
production of portion of a Leichhardt
letter and some of S. T. Gill’s water-
colors of the goldfields ; but it would
need many more color-plates to appeal
to the ordinary book-buyer on aesthetic
quality alone.
A collection by collectors for col-
lectors, it is a kind of tribute by the con-
tributors to themselves, or to their
“hobby”—and a tribute well worth pay-
ing, for the collection of Australiana is
something more than a hobby. It has
given us the Mitchell Library and the
historical paintings of the Dixson Gal-
leries. It has given us, in the National
Library at Canberra, the Petherick Col-
lection of more than 4000 volumes, the
Whelan Collection of autographed Aus-
tralian books and the Matthews Ornitho-
logical Library. And these are not merely
large assemblies of books; they are the
archives of the nation.
A nation exists as an Idea, built up
partly from personal experience but
deepened and made secure by tradition.
Something of the historical tradition
comes down by word of mouth, but most
of it in a great jumble of letters, diaries,
books and manuscripts of all kinds —
literary works for the publishers to re-
print, and raw material for the poet, the
painter, the historian and the novelist to
sift and shape into form so that it may
be assimilated by the new generations.
The collectors, who seek out and pre-
serve this mass of material, may do so
only for the fun of it; but they do,
literally, preserve the whole tradition of
the nation. They are good citizens ; they
are good fellows. It is a pleasure, having
read Across the Years, to join them in
paying tribute to themselves.
Hear the Praises of the Bird.
The tree that stands on this white hill
Is the pure gesture of its stone
And for that birth the stone was split
That seemed as lifeless as the moon.
And the frost nips at root and hone :
On the white hill the lamb leaps up,
The fox sups on a cloven foot
And blood follows the green sap.
Hear the praises of the bird )
The magpie in the dreaming mist
Turns the vaporous ice to gold,
Tips ike talons of the frost.
Hear the praises of the crow
Clanging from his iron beak :
From the womb the lamb shall leap
In full vigor, for my sake :
Love that knit the lamb’s shape
Told me where his kidney lies;
And the frosts that crooked my grip
Are the green tears in love’s eyes.

Murphy on Opal.
Despite a dust-jacket glittering witn
precious stones and the title They Struck
Opal (Associated General Publications,
Sydney) it is not until halfway through
the book that E. F. Murphy sells out
the stock of his general store at Wil-
cannia and, in 1889, sets out for White
CUffs to become, as lon Idriess says in
his foreword, “the undisputed king
among the opal-buyers.”
But, if he does not dig for or deal in
opal in his opening chapters, Murphy
never lacks color. As a knockabout story
of the outback the book is so good that
it would not matter if it never came to
White Cliffs and Lightning Ridge. . It is
a kind of opal itself; in the rough ; un-
polished; but warm with life, flashing
with adventure and, simple though it is,
lit with the Australian spirit.
Murphy is first encountered when he
is enduring a providential attack of
scarlet fever at St. Patrick’s College, Mel-
bourne, in 1875, which led to his being
sent to Paika Station on the Murrum-
bidgee and started him on his roving
career. On page 16 he is having his
shirt ripped by a Chinese cook’s offsider
who, armed with a knife, is expressing
his resentment at a fusillade of fat meat
from the shearers ; and from then on the
outback provides him with one adven-
ture after another.
He watches the lightning playing on
wool that, after scouring, had been laid
out in a paddock to dry:
It seemed to be playing in and out
amongst the men, all over the wool, and
the thunder was deafening. Some of the
men were praying aloud, others were swear-
ing, but they were all scared. It seemed
a miracle that no one was struck. We
only just managed to get the wool in
safely when the rain came down in torrents-,
and kept on for a solid week. That, in
no uncertain terms, was the end of the
1875 drought.
tt He takes part in a performance of
“Julius Caesar” in a woolshed. He is
bitten by centipedes. Camped miles from
nowhere he has his tucker stolen. He
sees an abo. courting his lady by break-
ing her arm with a billet of wood. At a
country race-meeting he meets a man
who tells him, just before the hurdle
race, that he had dreamed the previous
night that Spanker broke his neck at a
certain hurdle; and at that hurdle
Spanker does break his neck. Murphy
does not say so, but it appears that the
dreamer neglected to dream the winner.
Next, Murphy sees naked gins danc-
ing in the moonlight, and finds the scene
beautiful. Gold-prospecting on Mt.
Brown, he joins a band of a thousand
starving miners and pays 2s. 6d. for half
a pannikin of flour. He lives through the
Mt. Brown fever —a typhoid epidemic—
when the field became “a regular ceme-
tery of unnamed graves,” He learns that
a raw potato, scraped and compressed
in a cloth, will cure an inflamed eye.
Camping at Milparinka on the way to
the Tibooburra goldfields, he learns the
fate of one Billy, Moore who, lopping
limbs from a coolibah, was pinioned by
the leg in mid-air and died, the inhabi-
tants mistaking his cries for the not-
unfamiliar yells of somebody enjoying
the “horrors.”
Near “the Granite,” as Tibooburra was
then called, Murphy meets a bullocky
name Tom Collins —a literary coinci-
dence of some note: it would be pleas-
ing indeed, as well as euphonious, if
Murphy had encountered Furphy. With-
out pausing to speculate on the point,
however, Murphy passes on to Bullocky
Gully and there observes a granite
boulder splitting in halves in a sudden
rainstorm. He is next to be seen work-
ing at many kinds of jobs along the
Darling, where, of course, he sees floods,
notably the “historic downpour” of 1885
when “the Dry Lake, 18 miles from Wil-
cannia, was full for the first time in our
history ; there was only the roof of the
Dry Lake Hotel showing, and water
reached the top of the Bar at the Beef-
wood.”
Agitated, perhaps, by the sight of so
much water getting into his countrymen’s
beer, Murphy departs for Broken Hill,
works there for a while, comes back to
Wilcannia as a storekeeper, receives a
letter asking for flour and other supplies
with the postscript “My wife had a baby
last night, also icwt. of potatoes,” and,
overcome by so much domesticity, leaves
at last for White Cliffs.
The opal—and particularly the black
opal—is, as Murphy says, / Australia’s
“National Gem.” There is something
symbolic about it; something totemic.
Like Bradman and Phar Lap, it is a
national institution. As a pioneer gouger
and pioneer buyer—he was buying for
T C. Wollaston ve.~y soon after the White
Cliffs field was discovered—Murphy
treats the opal with becoming reverence;
and, of course, with authority. He tells
you almost everything you want to know
about opals; how they are formed, where
they have been found, what they are
worth, what notable specimens have been
discovered, and even where you may find
opals for yourself—“ The Queensland
area of opal-bearing country is far and
away the largest in Australia; and
although the eyes have been picked out
of the more accessible places, half of it
has never yet been prospected.”
The book is furnished with some ex-
cellent color-plates to show famous gems,
famous freaks and the different types of
opal, and Murphy, as usual, continues to
provide his own color in the way of
anecdote and adventure. He begins by
living for three months on galahs and,
as seasoning for this appetising dish, pro-
vides a chestnut —the one about put-
ting a stone in the pot. He tells of an
old man who asked for a block of soft
ground and who, after sinking six feet,
cleared £3290-worth of opal in three
months. He tells of the Stumpy Push of
Queensland who, until they were stoned
out of town, held the fields in a reign of
terror —“men were garrotted every night,
and the business people were in terror of
their lives.” He describes the grave of
Rossiter, propped up on long poles in
the old Southern Cross mine he dis-
covered —his unusual perch for eternity
being due to the fact that after he was
buried the mine was reopened, and
around and beneath him the miners
searched for opal.
And, of course, the color of the opals
themselves, as well as of adventure, comes
into the book, for Murphy describes
them vividly and with love. There are,
for instance, the opal fossils:
The most beautiful and perfect specimen
ever found was the skeleton of a plesio-
saurus, an extinct sea-reptile, all complete
except for the head, all fine-quality opal,
and only four or five feet long We also
got opalised corals, amongst them
crionoidias or sea-lilies —lovely things, with
stem and raying-out “leafy” top
Another lot of wood was remarkable in
that it was full of borer holes, and the
borer-insect itself, changed into opal, was
found at the end of each hole.
A humble borer-insect that has suffered
a sea-change into something so rich and
strange is almost, one feels, a more de-
lightful discovery than the famous gems ;
and Murphy seems to feel so, too. He
likes the romance of opals ; the mystery ;
the contact with the seas and the crea-
tures of antiquity. But, however charm-
ing insects of opal may be, they are pale
beside the great gems when Murphy
comes to them: “Pandora,” sold to a>col-
lector in London for £2000; the “Flame
Queen” from Lightning Ridge, valued at
£5000; the “Pride of Australia,” the
“Red Admiral” and the “Star of Bethle-
hem,” which “could be seen shining on
the darkest night before its wearer be-
came visible. I tested it once in a bank
vault and could see it glowing like a red
star at the back of the vault, though I
could not make out the person holding
it.”
Reviewed Briefly.
The Bishop’s Mantle: Agnes Sligh
Turnbull (Collins). A novel about an
American clergyman who, after various
difficulties in his career and after marry-
ing a beautiful and wealthy wife, enlists
in the Army as a chaplain. It has humor
and some touches of drama, but reads on
the whole like Trollope-and-sugar;
simple, homely, sentimental.
The Curiosity, of Etienne MacGregor:
Peter Cheyney (Hennel Locke, Ltd.).
Etienne’s uncle leaves him a fortune if
he can answer 13 questions within seven
days, otherwise the money is to go to
a Chinaman named Chi Leaf. The
sinister Oriental, needless to say, though
Etienne and a girl are very nearly
drowned in a cellar, does not triumph.
Suitable for small boys and girls up to
the age of 80.
Drifting Rain: James Mac Alpine
(printed by Conpress Printing, Ltd., 168
Caftlereagh-street, Sydney). Pleasant
light and rather scrappy verses on the
sea, on love and, with traces of the in-
fluence of W; H, Davies, on nature. An
unpretentious exercise in the familiar
conventions of thought, language and
technique. "
Thames Symphony: Oliffe Richmond
(Macdonald). A long poem presenting
the Thames as a symbol of freedom,
joy, peace, etc. Platitudinous and hack-
neyed, it won’t set the Thames on fire,
but some of the descriptions of river
scenery are attractive enough.

The Prime Minister has recently written
to 175,500 Australians about their invest-
ments in Commonwealth Loans. You are
one of these if you hold more than £lO worth of Bonds or Stock
in any of the Commonwealth Loan issues listed below. Here
are the reasons why you should study the Prime Minister’s letter
carefully .. . and at once!
When Commonwealth Loan
Bonds and Stock’ mature (as
those listed below are about to
do), they cease paying inter-
est. This means, of course,
that unless you take the right
action you will receive no
further returns from your
investment. The Prime Minis-
ter’s letter and the folder and
application form which accom-
pany it tell you what to do.
They provide you with an easy,
way to renew your investment
and so prevent any interrup-
tion to the regular payment of
interest on your money. The
Prime Minister’s letter also
gives you full details about
the Sixth Security Loan—the
new issue into which your
maturing securities may be
converted.
If you have not already done
so, complete the application
form which accompanied the
Prime Minister’s letter to you
and return it to-day.

Where were the modern revivals of
the Olympic Games held before the
latest celebrations ?
The instauration of the Olympic
Games took place in Athens in 1896,
on the site where the ancient festivals
had concluded 1500 years before.
Subsequent celebrations were held at
Paris (1900), St. Louis, U.S.A. (1904),

How to remove slime and sediment
from the bottom of a water-tank ?
Use a single hose long enough to
reach from the bottom of the inside
of the tahk out over the top, and
down to ground level outside. The
end of the hose inside the tank is
attached firmly to a piece of timber
so that it can be moved over the
sediment at the bottom; the end of
the hose should extend for lin.
beyond the timber. The siphon may
be started by sucking the water
through the hose when the inner end
is immersed in the water in the tank.
When the siphon starts to run the
inner end of the hose is moved oyer
the sediment by means of the stick
in order to draw off the sediment
without dispersing it through the
water. If this is carried out carefully
the sediment can be removed from
the bottom of the tank with the loss
of only a little water.

Who was “Pussyfoot” Johnson?
William Eugene Johnson, an Ameri-
can prohibition propagandist. Accord-
ing to Who’s Who in America, he
was known as “Pussyfoot” because
of his catlike policies in pursuing
lawbreakers in the Indian Territory.
He was chief special officer in the
U.S. Indian Service, 1908-11, during
which he secured 4400 convictions.
He became well known as a tem-
perance organiser and went to Eng-
land in 1919 in support of the cause.
He lost an eye at a prohibition meet-
ing at Essex Hall, London, by a
missile thrown by one of the crowd.
Pie also visited Australia.

How to treat books in which the
page margins show dull rusty
patches ?
Sometimes they may be removed by
chemical treatment, but it is often
better to accept the condition than
run the risk of weakening by treat-
ment. Bleaching is possible, but is
recommended only when it will do
no harm. When bleaching, use three
shallow (non-metal) trays, one filled
with potassium permanganate, the
second with water, the third with
potassium metabisulphite, each of the
potassium compounds diluted to loz.
to 16oz. water. Put the paper in the
permanganate solution for 30 to 60
seconds, when the sheet will turn a
deep, purplish brown. Wash off the
permanganate in the clean water, then
put in the potassium solution, when
the sheet will turn white. Leave sheet
in this pan until all stains disappear,
and then rinse under running water.
Dry between blotters and place in a
press to remove wrinkles. With single
sheets it may be (pest to cut them
out, bleach, wash and remount on
a stub left for the purpose.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.S. Spy-ring.
All things considered, it isn’t
surprising that U.S. defence
authorities decline to pass on
secrets' to a Commo-tolerating <
Australia. Not only over the
border in Canada but in the
U.S. as well they’ve had ample
close-up experience of Com.
Soviet spies—and in Govern-
ment positions at that.
The most staggering thing
about the Canadian disclosure
and trials was their revelation
of so many Canadians {not
foreigners) in responsible posts
willing to serve as spies or tools
in securing and passing-on in-
formation. Now, according to
N. Y. “Journal-American,” the
U.S. has experienced this, too.
Referring to the current
action following the disclosures
made by Elizabeth Bentley
(known in the conspiracy as
“Mary”), that newspaper says
her chief value was in establish-
ing a link between Americans
“high in Government circles and
members of the Soviet spy net-
work.”
“Mary,” the report states,
was a New England-born col-
lege woman who became active
in Communism through the in-
fluence of a highly-placed Red
(known to the fraternity as
“John”) with whom she was in
love. When this man died
“Mary” suffered revulsion at
what she felt was her betrayal of
her country, and went to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
with a sheaf of documents so
sensational that they were
looked upon as incredible until
checked by the bureau in an in-
vestigation that lasted' a year
and a half.
During this investigation
“Mary” kept up the pretence of
still being an active Communist
to obtain further information
for the F. 8.1. Her disclosures
revealed that the ring she took
command of after the death of
“John” in 1943 obtained for the
Russians the first drawing-board
plans of the B-29 bomber and
the formula for a war-time ex-
plosive, R-D-X.
“Mary,” according to the
“Journal-American,” sent re-
ports on U.S. plane- and arms-
production to the Kremlin at
such a rate that her reports
reached a volume of dozens of
pounds a week. It was then de-
cided to copy the reports on
micro-film —40 to 50 rolls a
week with each roll containing
photos of 40 pages.
Her subordinates, says the
“Journal-American,” “included
such personages as a personal
adviser to President Roosevelt,
a high-ranking Air Forces
officer, an official of the War
Production Board and members
of the staff of the Office of War
Information.”
Her connections in high
circles were such that she once
learned from a White House
attache that Army Intelligence
was on the verge of cracking the
Russian code. “This informa-
tion was promptly sent to the
Kremlin, with the result that the
Reds changed their code.”
Going by a report in N. Y.
“Sun,” part of the story of Com.
spying in the U.S. —on a par
with that in Canada, Americans
in Government jobs aiding—is
based on documents in the
hands of the F. 8.1. which tell of
infiltration tactics on a major
scale in Government agencies as
far back as 1934. (The “Sun”
itself was able to supply one of
these documents it had secured.)
In that year an agent of the
U.S. Reds returned from Mos-
cow with funds for promotion
of Communist activities in
America. A violin-studio in
Washington was used for the
headquarters. During the war
the headquarters changed to the
home of a Government official.
The organisational work be-
gan in the Agriculture Adjust-
ment Administration, in which
a Red cell was formed. Promis-
ing young men were taken into
the party, indoctrinated and then
told to scatter to other Govern-
ment agencies for the purpose
of forming new cells of not
more than ID members each.
This was done on a successful
and wide scale.
“Soon,” adds the N. Y. “Sun”
report, “the Farm Security Ad-
ministration was infiltrated,
former Senator Nye’s famous
Munitions Investigation Com-
mittee, the Immigration Service,
the State Department, the
Works Progress! Administration
and dozens of other New Deal
agencies and old-line Federal
bureaus were targets for the
spreading Reds.
“Once established, the Red cells
worked in two directions. Some
members devoted their time to
party recruits. Others plucked
timely production reports,
mineral statistics, administration
reports and general information
from the files for the higher-
ranking comrades to pursue.
Certain selected members served
as with comrades who
emerged into being and vanished
in the night after merely a word
of instructions or accepting a
handful of papers.”
Stating further that “as the
war progressed the party mem-
bers became more and more im-
portant iii the Federal agencies
into which they had infiltrated,”
the report declares; “Some
actually helped formulate
national policies ; others, later,
were accused of falsifying re-
ports upon which major United
States diplomatic relations with
Russia were determined.”
Corms in Japan.
Quoting as his informant “an
internationally-known Japanese,
a former member of the Diet
and opponent of the military
clique,” a correspondent of N.Y.
“World-Telegram” reports that
“the Communist advance in
Japan has now reached danger-
ous proportions”:
“Native Reds have infiltrated
into almost every phase of the
national life. They are conduct-
ing a nation-wide whispering
campaign, the gist of which is:
‘We are going, to control Japan
as soon as the Allies get out.’ ”
Their numbers are not great,
but “their influence is so over-
whelming, and their cell system
so remarkable and well distri-
buted, that the Japanese Govern-
ment is powerless to cope with it.
Nor do the other political par-
ties seem able to compete.
Already the Communists appear
to have gone far towards achiev-
ing their principal goal, which
seems to be to prepare for a coup
after the Allied withdrawal.”
The frequently - predicted
stepping-down of Hirohito is re-
garded as part of the Com. plan,
the “Moscow-directed Com-
munists working to make his
abdication merely the first in a
series of moves to abolish the
national religion around which
nearly everything in Japan re-
volves, As long as something
like the present system stands,
Communism will find it difficult-,
if not impossible, to gain a foot-
hold in Nippon. Because the
Emperor’s influence is spiritual
and religious, the strictly materi-
alistic Reds are up against the
one thing they find it hardest to
combat. Remove that influence,
they believe, and Japan would
be a pushover for Moscow.
Russia could then become the
dominant Power in the western
Pacific instead of the United
States.”
Berlin Omission.
Further to the blundering
failure of the Western Powers
specifically to reserve, at all
times, a corridor into Berlin
through the surrounding Soviet
zone (B. 18/8/’4B), N. Y.
“Times’s” very sound Washing-
ton representative, Arthur
Krock, after examining the
agreements, finds the Western
position “legally deficient.”
Not only was such a reserva-
tion omitted when the agreement
on control of occupied Germany
was entered into in June, 1945,
but the omission was “certified
permanently” in the subsequent
Potsdam palaver.
As Krock reads the Potsdam
agreement, the wording actually
lays down that when the joint
control prescribed is broken, as
the Soviets broke it recently, each
commander-in-chief has supreme
authority in his own territory.
The Soviet zone wholly envelops
Berlin, and consequently the
British, French and American
sectors therein.
Krock commented: “The
Soviet commander, supreme in
his own territory by the terms
of two compacts, was instructed
by Moscow to exercise that
supremacy by barring the ship-
ment of supplies to Berlin
through it from the other zones,
and has done so. Like the man
who painted the floor of a room
toward himself from the walls,
each of the Western Powers is
trapped in the centre, which is
its sector of Berlin.”
Commenting also that “There
must be an yfesop fable which
describes a similar lack of pre-
vision,” Krock points out that
not only the less-experienced
Americans but also the British
and French—“long experienced
in Continental diplomacy and
the convolutions of the Asiatic
mind”—were parties to the
blunder; in the Krock ver-
nacular, they all “played sand-
lot baseball in the big league,”
In “the joyous relief of victory
over the Nazis, and admiration
for the fortitude displayed by
the Russian people, they aban-
doned their efforts for precision.”
Hence their recent (some
might say richly deserved) dis-
comfiture at the hands of a ruth-
less war-time partner, who
earlier had been partner of the
Nazis, and who certainly had
not misled the trusting Western
leaders by any all-out" co-opera-
tion during the war.
Britain Gambles.
Austerities and all that ap-
parently haven’t lessened the
Briton’s fancy for giving his cash
“a bit of a flutter” under the
bite of the gambling bug, often
regarded as a peculiarly Aus-
tralian parasite.
Authoritative estimates quoted
by a London correspondent of
“U.S. News and World Report”
show that last year British
wagering amounted to over
£1,000,000,000—a lot of money
in any mint. And the rate con-
tinues, though there has been
some recent drop in going to the
dogs.
The quoted estimates show
that betting turnover on horse-
races for the year in Britain ap-
proximated £450,000,000.
Gambling on dog-races is cal-
culated at about the same figure.
Bets in football pools accounted
for another £70,000,000. “Gam-
bling of all other kinds” made
up the balance.
Actually, gambling in football
pools is estimated as the
“eleventh largest business in
Britain.” A single firm may em-
ploy as many as 1000 clerks.
The pools are based on a
soccer football season spread
over nine months of the year.
Millions of people take part,
so the first prize in a pool may
be almost as much as £60,000.
A Government tax, recently
raised to 20 per cent., is deducted
from the pool before the size of
the prize is computed.
The pools have come in for
some hot criticism as “an insane
wastage of paper at a time when
there is a severe shortage of
paper for schoolbooks, news-
papers and magazines.” The
pools involve “Collection and
delivery of millions of postal
packets weekly by men who
might be productively useful in
understaffed factories —a waste-
ful use of manpower.”
On the punting on horses and
hounds “While there are wait-
ing lists of thousands of business
and professional men for tele-
phones, there are thousands of
instruments used by bookies.
One firm alone boasts of its 300
telephone instruments.”
Some time back the mail
brought a most elaborately-
printed “Greyhound Racing En-
cyclopaedia,” published in Lon-
don (on much better paper than
most current English books) and
showing the numerous dog-
tracks of the National Grey-
hound Society in Britain. Lon-
don alone has 15 of them. On
the back of the publication, in-
cidentally, was a bookie’s ad.
showing him as having 200
phone numbers. _____
Skinned Satellite.
Broadcasts from Moscow
spread themselves on the happy
theme of Russia’s “generosity”
towards the “popular demo-
cracies,” meaning the cowed
satellites, in regard to repara-
tions.
How the “generosity” pans
out has been described in a letter
to N. Y. “Times” by former
Prime Minister of Rumania,
General Radescu, giving “a few
inadequately known facts about
the ruthless Soviet exploitation
of one of the Iron-Curtain
countries”' —to wit, his own.
“In accordance with the
armistice and peace terms,
Rumania’s main obligation to
the Soviet Union was supposed
to amount to 300 million dollars,
payable in kind, in six yearly
instalments (subsequently ex-
tended to eight). Up to Sep-
tember, 1946, the total charges
imposed by the Soviet Union
and paid by Rumania amounted
to 1050 million dollars. Since
then, Rumania has paid, under
various headings, an additional
amount of 735 million dollars.
The total value of Soviet extrac-
tions—in cash, goods and ser-
vices-—from September, 1944, to
June, 1948, thus amounts to
1785 million dollars.
“This represents 15 times
Rumania’s 1938 export and over
86 per cent, of her national in-
come for the period.” To make
clear just what this national-
income percentage means,
Radescu adds that in American
terms this would be as if the
United States had been forced to
pay to a foreign Power, over the
last three and one-half years,
about 450 billion dollars.
This is supposed to win friends
and influence people. Maybe it
does influence them!
Soviet Slave-camps.
A study of the Soviet “forced-
labor camps,” completed by an
escapee, Michael Romanenko,
and reported on by N. Y.
“Times” chief European corres-
pondent C. L. Sulzberger, lists
the following as “some of the
more important camps” provid-
ing forced labor for special pro-
jects :
Bam, or Baikal-Amur camp, to
construct a second line for the
Trans-Siberian Railway.
8.8. K., or White Sea-Baltic
camp, for the construction of a
canal linking the Baltic to the
White Sea.
Moscow Canal camp, which
has made the Moscow River
navigable for ships travelling to
the Caspian.
Northern Railway Construc-
tion camp, which has built the
(Arctic line between Kotlas and
Vorkuts.
Petchora camp, which de-
veloped coalmines in the
northern Urals.
The Siberian goldmining
camps, including the Kolyma
camp, to accelerate national gold
production.
Romanenko, who has himself
been incarcerated in several of
the camps, says that each of
those in the foregoing list “con-
tains several hundred thousand
prisoners.” He estimates that
60 per cent, of the prisoners are
“political”—millions of them in
all.
They represent, he says, a con-
siderable economic asset: “While
free workers in the Soviet Union
work eight hours a day and 275
days a year, camp inmates work
10 hours a day and 308 days a
year, thus yielding 40 per cent,
more annually for each man.”
He adds that the cost of sup-
porting a camp worker is less
than half the average salary paid
to a free worker, and concludes
that there are four economic
advantages to the Soviet State
in this system: The prisoners
work more and cost less. They
are submissive and can be trans-
ported where desired. They can
be employed for the most dis-
agreeable jobs. Their labor fur-
nishes funds to support the
organisation that controls them.

U.S.-Soviet Trade.— Latest figures
published in the U.S. show that
country’s exports to Russia as having
dropped to $200,000 for the month
of May, compared with $4,800,000
in the same month of 1947. And,
it is stated, “increasing difficulty in
obtaining licences [to export to
Russia] promises to reduce the trade
to zero.”

Liquidations Pending? —Some false
prophet or other should be thinking
sadly of Siberia by now, going by
a report from Berlin by N. Y.
“Times” manager Edwin L. James,
stating: “From Russian sources one
hears the date July 15 as the time
when they expected the Americans,
British and French to get out and
'leave the former German capital to
them.” Nor is it any secret, James
adds, that the success of the British
and Americans in organising the air
operation surprised the Russians, who
did not think it possible.

Volkswagen. More is apparently
to be heard of Hitler and Co.’s
“people’s car,” about which the late
firm (in liquidation, by fire) kicked
up such a happy hullabaloo. A
Belgian report quoted by “Wall-
street Journal” states that the Volks-
wagen is now to be produced for
world markets. Some 60,000 of the
cars were made by Hitler and Co.,
but went to the German Army. The
Fallersleben plant in the British occu-
pation zone, with 8000 workers, is
now making 1000 of them monthly.

E.R.P. Dickering. —ln the “private”
bargaining with the countries sharing
in the European Recovery Programme
the U.S. arranged for most of them
freely admitting goods from Germany
or Japan. “U.S. News and World
Report” interprets this as meaning
that “special barriers cannot be set
up against, for example, cheap
Japanese goods” as happened widely
in the past to protect home industries.
Naturally, Britain, with its big textile
industry, balked at the Jap goods,
and so did France, but both “will
give a break to goods from the U.S.
zone of Germany.”
. *. * * *
Slow Job in Greece. Differing
from Turkey, the strengthening of
which has been relatively speedy,
Greece is proving a tough job for
Uncle Sam, “U.S. News and World
Report” stating that the American
economic programme there is “six
months behind schedule, and the first
$150,000,000 in American non-military
aid is not going as far as had been
hoped.” The difference between the
two countries can be put in a word,
Communists a luxury the Turks
prefer to do without.
* * * *
Television. “Wall-street Journal”
reports some 300,000 television sets
served by 26 “video” stations in the
U.S.; likely to be about a million by
the end of the year. By comparison,
there are some 60,000,000 ordinary
radios (including car-sets), but, com-
ments the “Journal,” television is
worrying the radio and movie in-
dustries: “A bitter pill for broad-
casters is the fact that a television-set
owner gained is a radio-listener prac-
tically lost. Movie men, too, have
found television luring away some ot
their most faithful patrons.”
* * * *
“Paradise” Rejected. —Boosters of
the Soviet “paradise” (how silent its
once-voluble churchmen condoners
have been of late!) fail to explain
why it should be that every nation
in Europe free to choose has turned
that system down. Rightly describing
this as “one of the most remarkable
manifestations of our time,” N. Y.
“Times” editorially expands the
theme: “In circumstances that should
breed revolution, people as far apart
and war-ravaged as the French and
the Finns, the Italians and the Dutch,
refuse to accept the Communist
panacea. Wherever it has been forced
upon them, moreover, the populations
are making open signs of rebellion.

Veto-destroyed U.N.O. —Certain to
provoke some plain speaking at
U.N.O.’s next gathering (in Europe
in September), the veto-power (or
rather the Soviet abuse of it) has
as good as destroyed U.N.O. already.
New Zealand representative Berend-
sen has put the position in straight-
enough terms to the Little Assembly-
“ Collective security is a thing of the
spirit. It depends on the determina-
tion of mankind to do right ana
resist wrong. There are millions an
millions who think as we do. hu
until the veto is removed, you cam
establish collective security through
this organisation. If the veto is r '
moved, you have a chance —depend-
ing on your spirit, courage and de-
termination.”

Philippines’ Boom. Under its
special trade arrangements, the U- •
has practically a monopoly of Philip-
pines’ trade, reckoned as representing
a $500,000,000-a-year market for U.»-
goods (it also has military-naval-an
bases; if J. Bull granted indepen-
dence” on these terms the yells in
some American quarters would tw
deafening). However, U.S.rse'
and World Report” sees the Filipih° f
prosperity as artificial: t
being based on sound production,
comes from big dollar payments-
the U.S. Government and from otner
special conditions. When these c
ditions pass out of the picture,
long from now, the boom may t
up and the buying of U.S ;j g°°
may drop to little or nothing.

LESSONS FROM THE PAST.
The wholesale destruction of historical
monuments helps to explain the normal
Australian’s attitude of discontent
with his lot. The latest piece of vandal-
ism has been the pulling-down in Sydney
of one of the three or four oldest build-
ings in Sydney—the old military
surgeons’ barracks on Observatory Hill.
In any other country it would have been
a national treasure protected by every
means known to the law.
The existing fashion of treating the
past and precedent with contempt has
a distinct bearing on the national out-
look, since a nation which has no known
history has no standards of comparison
by which to measure its progress. In
some circles, of course, the past is un-
popular for very potent reason. A survey
of it would provide a fine reference for
free enterprise and the hated capitalists,
and would prove that they, and not the
demagogues of the present curious
“Golden Age,” have produced almost
everything which the average citizen holds
dear.
The people’s “saviors” of today have
produced little except lawlessness and
discontent, rising costs and class-hatred,
and standards of freedom which almost
approximate to those of the more lenient
periods of the convict age, save that in
those far-off days the Government pro-
vided everybody, free, with a weekly
ration which included seven pounds of
beef or four pounds of pork —a com-
modity now almost forgotten—and eight
pounds of wholesome wholemeal bread.
There is little to be discontented about
in the general progress of the country up
until the past six or seven years, during
which railways have ceased to be con-
structed, and those which have been built
are in a state of irredeemable bankruptcy
and rapid material decay, and labor
for the first time in Australian annals
has become so short as to be totally in-
adequate for its task —a condition of
affairs mainly due to the wholesale
preaching, by those now in authority, of
the gospel of loaf and strike.
While it raises no pride in the country
to survey the present, with its quarrels
and shortages, its threats of revolution
and its class-warfare, it is certainly a
source of pride to look back and see
what has been achieved in a hundred
years or so.
A century ago the fathers of many
men alive today had been born, the
grandfathers of a very great number. Yet
at the census nearest to 1848 the total
population of the colony of New
South Wales, which covered the inhabited
mainland of Australia outside the tiny
settlements at Adelaide and on the Swan
in the west, was only 187,000. The popu-
lation of Sydney and its suburbs was
45,000. The country was little known
in the interior or on its coasts.
The explorations of Sturt, Mitchell,
Strzlecki, Leichhardt and Kennedy were
contemporary history. Mitchell had only
recently discovered the rivers of his
south-western Queensland traverse. The
continent had not been crossed by land
east to west. The news of the loss of
Leichhardt was fresh in the memory of
the colonists, and the searchers were on
the watch along his proposed route to
the Northern Territory. The Clarence
River in New South Wales had been
found only eight years before. Gippsland
had been discovered no more than half a
decade. Port Phillip, Perth and Adelaide
were up-and-coming villages; Brisbane
was only about to cease to be entirely
a penal settlement in which the two main
public buildings were a capacious jail and
a treadmill.
There was no responsible government,
though New South Wales had a Legis-
lative Council of sorts and the separation
movements had begun to succeed, mainly
through the efforts of the indefatigable
Dr. John Dunmore Lang. There was no
university, though Lang and Wentworth
had long worked for one, and three years
would see the foundation of Sydney’s
forgetful and now completely over-
crowded institution, along with the grant-
ing to the colony of Parliamentary rights
and the discovery of gold. Only a few
men had the faintest conception of what
the next century might bring, for
Europe was still three months away by
sea and there were-no railways, ,
Nobody in 1848 could have had the
faintest inkling that within a century
Australia would be a modest Power in
the world, with a national debt six times
that of Britain after the Napoleonic wars
and a taxation collection which would
have made Pitt and Liverpool open their
eyes in amazement, especially had they
noted that the country was unable to
provide, out of a bloated revenue con-
siderably greater than was available to
them at the time of the Wellington vic-
tories, for even incipient defence by
land or sea.
Nobody a hundred years ago could
have forecast that Europe would be
brought within a few hours’ travelling
time by air of Sydney and Melbourne, or
that the Commonwealth would become
a great industrial country, all of which
has been achieved not under a blighting
socialism, but under and by the capital-
ism which its opponents profess to scorn
—though which they personally embrace
whenever the opportunity offers and
under a class co-operation which is being
rapidly destroyed in accordance with
ideas imported from East European bar-
barism.
One of the most singular differences
between the attitudes of 1848 and 1948
is the viewpoint of the average man and
of localities about their rights of gov-
ernment.
Whereas in recent years the tendency
has been towards huge unwieldy States
and an all-powerful Government with
more and more centralisation in the
hands of a small group of despotic legis-
lators, the tendencies of 1848 were to-
wards small, continually subdivided com-
munities with the power to control their
own destinies and expand their own re-
sources. The revolt against , Sydney
domination was almost as striking as the
results which followed separation.
There seem to be vital lessons to
be learnt from the past at the moment,
when current political policy is .produc-
ing centralisation rather than expansion,
when the land which is the source of all
wealth is being loaded with increasing
burdens —already at almost unbearable
proportions —and when the outlying areas
are being stripped of population and the
tendency of all small communities is to
shrink rather than to grow unless thay are
under the shadow of one of the great
cities.
There seems, in fact, to be room for
a return to the century-old policy of local
self-government and the development of
local enterprise, a policy which would
rob the demagogues of the vast tyrant
“key” unions in Sydney, Melbourne and
Brisbane of much of their sovereign
power to do mischief.
The Maoriland Pound.
The sudden action of the New Zealand
Government in restoring the original
parity of its currency with sterling has
aroused an old controversy in Australia.
Mr. Chifley has stated that “it is not the
Government’s intention in the present
circumstances to appreciate the Aus-
tralian pound.” The bringing of the £A
to parity with the £ sterling would, in
fact, involve more unsettling readjust-
ments than Mr. Nash is faced with in
Maoriland. It is * the rising level of
costs in his country that has persuaded
Mr, Nash and his colleagues to enforce a
form of deflation least immediately
objectionable to the trade-unions.
Until last week it was necessary to
provide £125 in either Australian or New
Zealand currency to pay a debt of £lOO
sterling. It still requires that much Aus-
tralian money, but the Maorilander can
exchange £lOO N.Z. for £lOO sterling,
settle debts on that basis, buy new goods,
take out a steamship ticket with a British
company, travel to Britain and pay
British living expenses all on the basis
of pound for pound. The Australian still
has to provide £125 for every £lOO sterling
involved in steamship fares, London hotel
expenses, debts and interest owing in
Britain, goods bought from Britain and
for any money transmitted to Britain.
But the Maoriland exporter of butter,
frozen and chilled lamb, wool, etc., now
gets only £lOO in M.L. currency for every
£lOO sterling realised in Britain for his
produce. The Australian gets £125 Aus-
tralian for £ 100-sterling value of exports.
And, seeing that both New Zealand and
Australia are big exporting countries,
with profits to essential primary pro-
ducers determined by the level of mone-
tary returns from exports in relation to
the internal costs of production, any
attempt to give either Dominion’s cur-
rency an increased value in relation to
any external currency, thereby reducing
the rates at which internal money is con-
verted into overseas money, is not a thing
to be contemplated merely from the view-
point of those wishing to travel or spend
money abroad. Every consideration has
to be given to the economic position of
those who earn for us money abroad —
in other words, to the export industries
and the men on the land.
In New Zealand it was comparatively
easier to arrive at a revaluation decision.
The exporter who loses in returns from
produce sold abroad will get a fairly large
compensating benefit in lower costs of
living and production. Maorila*hd im-
ports from overseas a great deal more of
its agricultural and other machinery, and
its general living requirements than does
Australia. These sterling imports should
fall in landed cost as much as the export
returns from wool and fat lambs. But
goods made in Maoriland and used by ex-
porters and others alike will most likely
remain near their old level, wages may
not come down anything like 20 p.c.,
and to this extent the Maoriland producer
for export will be penalised. The Gov-
ernment, of course, may soften the blow
by some “equalisation” fund on the ex-
port-prices side; it seems that some of
the price for export butter at least has
been withheld by the Government in the
past, and in the future the exporter may
get the full export price.
Our Bretton Woods obligations aside,
Australia would find the change to
parity with sterling more difficult because
of the large proportion of our require-
ments that are manufactured in this coun-
try. A fall in the cost of sterling imports
would not recompense the landman to the
extent that the Maorilander is helped, be-
cause a greater proportion of machinery,
clothing and other living requirements
are made in Australia, and are not
immediately affected as to cost by move-
ments in the exchange rate. And in this
country.at the moment it might be diffi-
cult to bring in lower wages even if the
cost of imported living requirements were
reduced. All our export industries would
suffer a sudden blow because of the loss
of the “export premiufn,” and local manu-
facturers would meet much keener com-
petition (because of cheaper imports) at
a time when industrial lawlessness is at
its worst.
The New Zealand action can be classed
as deflationary: a shock attack on living
costs, perhaps. But there will be no
worth-while fall in Maoriland living costs
until the production per man per hour
rises in the Dominion. There will be
something of a monetary fiction about the
reduced costs expected to follow Mr,
Nash’s move.
The singlehanded action of the Maori-
land Socialists raises the question of
whether Britain is contemplating any
imminent devaluation of sterling in rela-
tion to the dollar and a raising of the
price of gold. The U.K. Government
has been reluctant to depreciate sterling
until internal production costs have
stabilised and conditions creating a
sellers’ export market no longer prevail.
The independent action of New Zealand
in appreciating its currency seems to de-
note that Mr. Nash had grown impatient
with the British Treasury.
Though Maoriland will now get $4.02
to the £ instead of $3.20, it will earn no
more dollars than if the old rate con-
tinued. It will simply exchange fewer
pounds for the limited, number of dollars
that are available. And, of couise, the
final exchange of the two currencies
occurs among Maorilanders themselves.
Someone’s monetary gain has to be some-
one else’s loss.
It is true that at the present time land-
men engaged inr most rural industries are
getting high prices for their products,
and will probably never see a time again
when, from the prices aspect alone, they
could better face a drop in the exchange
rate. But Australia has by no means ex-
perienced the full impact of its potential
costs inflation yet —price-control and sub-
sidies have put a deceptive face on our
economy—and this has to be remembered
when we compare our living costs and
production costs with those in the United
States or Britain.
Taxation, too, is at an inflated level,
and is something that should be adjusted
as complementary to any deflationary
move that might be made in Australia.
Mr. Chifley has shown great reluctance to
do the obviously beneficial thing in this
respect. His 100,000 extra civil servants
need to be put to productive work in
private industry, and discipline intro-
duced to militant trade-unionism, as
part of any programme aimed at bringing
Australian conditions more into line with
those obtaining in, say, the United States.
Moscow Force.
For some three weeks the envoys of two
great Western Powers, leaders of the
democracies, have been attempting to get
Moscow to see reason over Berlin.
But so long as the British and American
Governments accept the role of suitors
to Moscow their people may be assured
that they are conforming exactly with the
Soviet’s desires, that they will win no
“concessions” save those which Moscow
may devise to lure them on to further
ignominy, and that they will certainly
fail to restore the political and economic
health of Western Europe. They will not
prevent another war.
If the pilgrimage a la Munich were
undertaken simply to convince the demo-
cratic peoples that it is Russia who is
upsetting the apple-cart, then it may Be
retorted that most people are by now
convinced. More probably it is sheer
leading from weakness, a general tem-
porary weakness in the Atlantic Powers
caused by:
America’s immersion in the distractions
of the Presidential election-season.
Britain’s political and material debility
from war-exhaustion and socialism com-
bined.
The demoralisation of France, whose
modern habit of collapsing in face of an
international crisis is the despair of her
friends.
The farce of pretending that U.N.O. as
at present constituted is of any value what-
ever for its intended purpose.
There is, of course, some deeper trouble
behind this feeble exhibition. What that
trouble' may be is for the Western demo-
cracies to discover and eradicate, without
delay, if some of them, at least, are not
-to be lost irrecoverably. Wtyle they re-
main—as currently appears —reluctant to
face the elemental truths of the situation
they have to deal with, their “problems”
will continue to afflict them and every
settlement sought will elude them.
As for making any agreement with
Moscow worth a dollar’s purchase, the
Western Powers’ present behavior hardly
gives them a chance. The contemptible
quarrel in New York, the charges and
counter-charges of lying and kidnapping
exchanged on an Ambassadorial level (to
use the flash modern phrase), over the
question of which of two Great Powers
should protect a couple of schoolteachers
from physical maltreatment (as mutually
alleged) by the other, is proof enough of
the impossibility of accord over anything.
Washington and Moscow today could
not agree about the color of a horse or
the number of pins in a row. What
faintest prospect is there of a composition
over Berlin, where each side has taken
up a position which appears to forbid
retreat by either without intolerable loss
of “face”?
The factors governing the situation are
these:
(1) The chief result of the Allied victory
was to destroy on each side of Communist
Russia the only barriers which had held
its aggression in check Germany and
Japan.
(2) The ineluctable obligation -of the
Western Powers is now to set up new
barriers in the same places—which means,
in effect, the old barriers in a new dress.
(3) From the moment of Germany’s sur-
render, if not earlier, Moscow’s energies
have been directed to resisting, in antagon-
ism to its war-time Allies, developments
which it foresaw—-because it was engineer-
ing them—long before the U.N.0.-bhnded
leaders of ,the democracies.
Naturally, therefore, Britain and America
can have from Moscow any arrangement
(for so long as one could last) they like
about Berlin, if, in exchange, they will
abandon the European Recovery Pro-
gramme, and refrain from any organisa-
tion of either Western Germany or West-
ern Europe without Russia having therein
a voice (that is, of veto). There must be
no barriers against Russia, in west or
east. There must be no hegemony ot
democratic States west of the Rhine to
match the aggressive hegemony of Com-
munist States on the east. It follows that
there tnust be no ban in any country
anywhere against freedom of the Com-
munist party to pursue its treasonable
conspiracy by way of softening-up the
non-Russian world for the boa-con-
strictor’s ultimate absorption. .
That the West should oppose this pro-
gramme does not necessarily mean war.
To yield to it, however, assures beyond
doubt either' war or the degradation to
slave-camp level, or both. Firmness has
already won some ground. Up to date
it has preserved Turkey and Spain from
the Communist dry-rot; it has redeemed
tricky situations in Greece and Tneste;
and, by effluxion of time, it has seen an
incipient revolt against the Cominform by
Yugoslavia. Russia itself, as each day
passes, draws nearer to her own troubles
—the insurrection in Poland and the
Balkans which is inevitable, sooner or
later, and the turmoil awaiting the sue;
cession to Stalin in the dynasty of Com;
munist Tsars. :; i
A firm stand by the Western Powers
henceforth would seem, however, to re-
quire some active measure to point a
moral and adorn the diplomatic protests.
One such measure suggests itself, me
Western Powers might demand in open
session at U.N.O. Assembly a reaffirma-
tion by each member of its original
pledges under the United Nations
Charter and especially Articles 1 and A
and the indictment of any member State
committing a breach of those plf d B
should not be beyond U.N.O. s ability
to devise the means either to compel an
insurgent State like Soviet Russia to•con
form with the principles of Internationa
society or forthwith to banish it trom
membership. Upon its ability to enforce
loyalty, as the least of its funcuoffi,
UNO itself should stand or fall. It ln
organisation is indeed doomed the sooner
the world recognises the truth the bette.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Parliament—Last Lap.
Parliament meets again next week for
its final session in the Chifley Govern-
ment’s business of tearing to pieces our
economy, institutions and all that harmony
among the people required for the over-
whelmingly urgent national jobs ahead.
Since the Royal visit is planned for early
next year, G.-G. McKell evidently felt
the need for a bit of practice with cere-
monial, and he will open the new session
in state.
With Caucus members the Royal visit
will no doubt take second place to con-
cern for the party’s fortunes in the last
lap before the general elections. Leaving
aside these obvious preoccupations, Par-
liament is' to be concerned with:
The Budget, containing the minimum in
sops to the community which is calculated
to win votes.
The Bigger Parliament bill, meant to
save seats for as many of the faithful as
have any hope of being re-elected.
Possible amendments to the Bank Grab
Act, kicked out of the High Court as
invalid, in the effort to legitimise some-
thing of the wretched thing.
The New Guinea Bill, amalgamating
Australia’s sovereign territory with the
adjoining trustee area, which will thereby
flout the recent condemnation from U.N.O.
Trusteeship Council of that very procedure.
A post-mortem on the Free Medicine
Scheme, if it is really dead.
There is a host of other matters which
Parliament ought, but (as hitherto) will
probably not be allowed, to thrash out,
especially the Government’s extra-
ordinary tolerance and protection of the
Communist party, now an instigator, as
Moscow’s servant, of disaffection and
conspiracy against the British Empire’s
interests in S.-e. Asia.
The first working year of this Parlia-
ment was marked by the Government’s
sabotage of the Arbitration Court, and it
ended with Chifley straining his financial
powers (against local-government bodies)
under the 1945 Bank Act. The public
reaction was seen in the signal defeat of
“Labor” in South Australian and Wes-
tralian elections, and in the contentious
section of the Bank Act being expunged
from the statute-book by the High Court.
Parliament’s second working year be-
gan with the Chifley Government’s vin-
dictive attempt to introduce socialisation
with a new Bank Grab Act which pro-
posed to sweep away the trading banks
altogether. Amid a nation-wide outcry of
resentment yet another State, Victoria,
at general elections threw “Labor” out
on its neck, and the banks and several of
the State Governments joined in impeach-
ing the new Bank Act before the High
Court. Next the Government tried to
make permanent its war-emergency con-
trol of all business' prices; at the refer-
endum to secure this it was decisively
beaten in every State. As monetary in-
flation grew sharply and production
slowed down alarmingly under the new
shorter - working week, Parliament’s
second year closed with another High
Court judgment, invalidating the Gov-
ernment’s 1947 Bank Act.
That is the point from which the
Chifley crowd now picks up the running
for the final lap of this Parliament. Be-
cause—and only because —Federal elec-
tions loom ahead, there may be some
motions of easing a taxation burden
which is as stupid (from the aspect of
achieving greater production) as it is
ferocious and partisan.
U.N.O. and the Kremlin.
Nobody can assail the disinterested -de-
votion to international peace of Jan
Smuts and Gilbert Murray. All who hoped
to build up first the League and now the
United Nations owe a vast debt to these
two workers for peace, both nearing an
age when they must call on others to take
over the torch.
At Cambridge recently, in the cere-
mony investing him with the Chancellor-
ship of the University, General Smuts
warned the Western world of the “silent
sinister process” of the new technique of
internal disruption. “You cannot,” he
said, “counter the infection by sweet
reasonableness”:
As long as they [the Russiar Communists]
think they can play this game without risk
of real war, they will continue their new
technique of aggression, with results which
may be as devastating to human freedom
as war itself In this moment of almost
mortal weakness things may happen which
neither blood nor tears could wash away
thereafter.
And, quoting Pericles, he concluded;
“Happiness is freedom; and freedom is
courage.”
Professor Gilbert Murray Ms just pub-
lished his observations on the current
scene in his new book From the League
to UJV. He ascribes the real cause of
the two world wars not to capitalist
rivalry for markets but to aggressors’ lust
for power. The dream of mastering
Europe which dazzled the Kaiser and
Hitler in turn is now dazzling the die-
tator of the Kremlin. To summarise his
argument:
If U.N.O. cannot offer collective security,
it is useless. Its disabilities arise because
the Great Powers are profoundly divided,
not so much by the ideological clash be-
tween Communism and capitalism or social
democracy as by the radical opposition
between the totalitarian and the liberal
conception of life, between the tyranny of
the few and the aspirations of the many,
between the rule of terror and the rule of
law. The contempt of “bourgeois morality”
and the cult of violence are themselves
symptoms of the moral poison of war.
....“The Russian view of life and politics
is guile inconsistent with the ideal of the
United Nations.”
That’s his diagnosis. He proceeds to
prescribe the treatment by demanding
that;
Against this fanatical exaltation of power
tve must stand for the things in which we
believe, for toleration, for charity, for the
rights of man. We must stand for them
unflinchingly by rebuilding a free and
Christiap Europe under British leadership,
not by “running away from war,” but by
steadily combating “the evil spirit that
produces it, by holding firm to the sense
of values, of obligations, of things of
beauty, which are somehow beyond ques-
tion, and which, at whatever cost of endur-
ance, humanity must not betray."
For U.N.O. to continue to find a privi-
leged place within its midst for a per-
sonification of “the evil spirit that pro-
duces war” is surely not to be tolerated.
"A Great Victory."
From a special cold-war correspondent:
There was a charming touch about the re-
lease from jail in Brisbane of three “poor
victims of capitalism”—Messrs. Jylius, a Com-
munist barrister, Englart, Communist secretary
of the Waterside Workers in Brisbane, and
Michael Healy, Communist secretary of that
stalwart “Labor” organisation the Brisbane
Trades Hall Council.
The three heroes were sentenced to three
months’ jail apiece on August 4 for having
failed to pay fines, totalling in the aggregate
about £350, imposed on them under the Anti-
pickCting Act. Two minor characters were
sentenced on August 6. They are still in clink.
On August 12 another Healy and E. V.
Elliott, as emissaries from the Central Com-
mittee of the Communist party, addressed what
were called “major” meetings which passed
readied-up Marx House resolutions demanding
the release of the men with automaton-like
docility, showing, however, an apathetic air
when general strikes were mentioned. The
prevailing attitude evidently proved to the
visitors that the jig was up and that the time had
arrived for them to find an excuse to flit the
northern scene.
Hurriedly they called together the seamen
and watersiders and the Central Railway Dis-
putes Committee. To all these bodies, which
must have been glad to sec the last of them,
another identical resolution was submitted:
We call upon the A.C.T.U. to convene
immediately a meeting of the inter-State
executive with a view to organising all
affiliated unions in a demand to secure the
release of these workers.
Mr. Healy told a gathering of bored-looking
wharfies at the Stadium that “certain nego-
tiations were in progress, but he could not
divulge them,” and then an amendment was
put up by one of his henchmen that the men’s
fines should be paid. This was rejected firmly,
after which Comrades Healy and Elliott left for
Sydney, remarking that the A.C.T.U. executive
was meeting in Melbourne on August 18 —it
was not —and they must make their arrange-
ments accordingly.
Also, on August 12, Mr. Ernie Thornton’s
Ironworkers —he himself was in Broken Hill
exhorting the free and “independent” to vote
for a prosperous medico at a municipal by-
election, with no more success than his col-
leagues of the Central Committee achieved in
Brisbane —held a meeting at the Ipswich work-
shops and voted in favor of the Central Dis-
putes Committee paying the fines of the im-
prisoned men "from money set aside for paying
any fines imposed on union members for de-
monstrating in the railway strike.” And it
was also resolved that there should be no
strike without a ballot.
The A.C.T.U. being as enthusiastic about
taking over the dispute from the Moscow
admirers as an old lady would be about nursing
a black snake, the next move was up to Com-
rades Healy and Elliott, but they were relieved of
embarrassment by the appearance on the table
of the messenger to the Brisbane Justice De-
partment of a bundle of 35 £lO notes, accom-
panied by a letter saving that it was meant
to meet the fines of the three principal Boggo-
road martyrs.
Mr Hanlon’s minions had no option but to
let them go free.
Their release stirred the Sydney “Tribune”
to such enthusiasm that it issued its Saturday
edition on Thursday night to announce in a t
the tyrant Hanlon had been defeated by ' the
irresistible weight of a nation-wide wave or
protest” which had forced the Government to
pay the fines itself. The Communist party
declared itself the winner of a “great victory,
and in its excitement almost broke the rec °!l c t
of the “Labor Daily,” which, in the Ivzo
election campaign, was able to put on the
train, 25 minutes before the “event” occurred a
full account of how a band of Fascist thugs,
armed with brand-new pickhandles, invaded its
office and bound its editor to his chair.
Nobody has admitted providing the money
for the fines. Mr. Hanlon has said that he
will find out. It is all as mysterious as the
£7OOO which was recently floating round in the
post wrapped up in brown paper.
Hanlon, New-Stater.
An astonished Queensland heard the
State Governor, opening its Parliament
the other day, say that “my advisers are
prepared to recommend the establishment
of additional States in Queensland when,
as a result of their development policy,
the new States will have a reasonable
degree of financial and economic
stability.” His advisers are the Hanlon
Labor Government, and it is what that
Government is pleased to call its “de-
velopment policy” that has provoked the
New State movement in the North, whose
people are convinced that all they can
expect from either Brisbane or Canberra
is continuing neglect.
What astonished them was to hear a
“Labor” Premier apparently supporting
new States, for so far as anybody knows
“Labor” has not given up its unification
policy, which means the abolition of all
States as political entities and the con-
centration of power in Canberra. Mr.
Hanlon, for all his good points, is as
much a subscriber to that policy as he is
to the other “Labor” scheme of socialisa-
tion.
Asked by Brisbane “Courier-Mail” to
expound a little, Mr. Hanlon said a few
things that quickly dispelled any dreams
(Continued on page 10 .)
POTENTIAL JUMPER?
“Please take me into your protective custody! I’m afraid I might be recalled to Australia to answer questions
when Parliament opens. I'll do anything—I'd even accept a job as president of the U.N.O. General
Assembly.”

New Staters might have had of seeing
subdivision begin at once. Mr. Hanlon
proposes to “build up” a new State by
establishing new industries and so forth,
and will “ultimately” create a new State
when “requisite financial and economic
stability is reached.” He then produced
the argument that if North Queensland
had been a separate State in the 1946-47
financial year it would have had a deficit
of £1,100,000, whereas South Queensland
would have had a surplus of £1,116,000.
What’s more, said he. North Queensland
as a State could never have financed the
building of the Burdekin Dam, “major
cost of which will fall on the South.”
All of which is assuming that had N.Q.
been a State it would still have the same
population and underdevelopment that it
suffers as a neglected part of Queens-
land : that, for instance, N.Q. would still
have been sending its land and mineral
products south and buying them back as
manufactured goods. One of the reasons
why the North wants to go it alone is
because it is sick of being told that it
must depend on the South for things
like the Burdekin Dam.
The fact that the Country party has
come out flat for a N.Q. State and is
thereby gaining impressive support
obviously stirred the Hanlon Government.
But the Hanlon announcement, with its
condition of “financial and economic
stability”—a condition which the Han-
lons themselves propose to bring about —
means nothing. N.Q. won’t achieve
Statehood through any Brisbane Govern-
ment, but only by its own united and
vigorous determination.
POLITICAL POINTS
When this went to the printer statis-
ticians and crystal-gazers were still try-
ing to decide whether Tasmania’s next
Government was to be “Labor,” Liberal
plus Independent, “Labor” plus Inde-
pendent or no Government at all; the
last alternative seemed the most likely,
with “Labor” holding 15 seats, Liberals
12, Independents three. Cosgrove vowed
on the hustings he would not take office
if he had to depend on the support of
Independents, but then “Labor” has
vowed many things at election-time. If
he does overcome his scruples, and if one
of the Independents does grant him sup-
port or accept the Speakership, the dead-
lock with the Upper House will remain.
Where the population is evenly
balanced in its political views—and this
is so in Tasmania to an even greater de-
gree than in the rest of the Common-
wealth —the Hare-Clarke system of Pro-
portional Representation makes for stale-
mates in elections. Only three Govern-
ments since 1922 have had a majority of
more than two before appointing a
Speaker. Primary votes so far counted
show that the trend against “Labor” is
continuing—the big swing came in 1946,
earlier than in the other States. “Labor”
got 51 per cent, of the primaries in
1946 ; on Saturday the figure was 49.4
per cent.
Controls of the sale of vacant urban
land in N.S.W. will cease on September
20, though the McGirrs, echoing Can-
berra, have long been protesting that such
action would bump up building costs.
Actually it will do nothing of the sort.
Recognition of control went long ago, and
for a year or more the sale of a suburban
block at V.G. valuation has been almost
as rare as the sale of a second-hand car
at pegged price. Removal of control will
mean that hundreds of vacant allotments
kept off the blackmarket by their owners’
respect for the law will now come up
for sale,
Victoria’s Hollway startled the natives
of the unexploited south-east corner of
the continent last week by suggesting that
Victoria and N.S.W. should combine for
the development of Eden as a major port,
with the possibility of a new State for
the area. If the thing came off it would
stop all this scheming about the Snowy
River, which would necessarily be the
new State’s chief source of water and
power. McGirr hasn’t spoken; perhaps
he is still trying to recall just where
Eden is.
Montgomery on believers in push-
button warfare: “It is only men without
actual responsibility for the country’s de-
fence who can afford to make these airy-
fairy statements.” Australia’s most
prominent apostle of the push-button era
is its Prime Minister.
Theodore, “Labor” member for Her-
bert in the Queensland Assembly, has
come out in support of the Balt migrants
working in the canefields —there are 700
of them, mostly employed north of
Townsville. His judgment* is that they
are good workers and good types of
citizens eager to fit in with the Australian
way of life, and that the claim that they
are being used to break down the con-
ditions of Australian workers is “scur-
rilous and unwarranted.” Theodore’s
opinion of these new Australians is con-
firmed by an ex-U.N.R.R.A. official now
in Sydney who claims that the Balts are
the cream of Europe’s D.Ps. and that
Calwell can be congratulated on securing
them for Australia. The Minister’s
guarantee that the migrants’ wives, now
in Germany, will be brought out to join
them as soon as possible is a sensible
move. One couple happily placed in
North Queensland is worth more to Aus-
tralia than half a dozen added to the
crowded cities of the south.
The horse is reputed to be man’s best
friend; Bernborough has been all that
to restaurant-owner and pubkeeper
Romano. Romano (or Azzalin) has had
shipped to him what Sydney “Daily
Mirror” describes as a “£l5OO Chrysler
‘New Yorker’ car.” Dollars? No, Bern-
borough. A present from “Hollywood
film magnate Louis B. Mayer,” according
to the “Mirror,” which adds: “Mr.
Romano said there was nothing unusual
in the gift, which was in appreciation of
his sale to Mr. Mayer of the sire Bern-
borough.” Ah, “A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse! ”

Who could the other four be?
The people of N. S. Wales asked for
more coal; their Premier, McGirr, is to
provide night trotting and other extended
facilities for gambling. Hitherto-pub-free
Sydney residential suburbs are having
pubs forced on them without local option.
The Sydney Turf Club represents Sydney
“Labor’s” chief “war effort,” betting and
booze its most evident post-war pre-
occupation. Noting all this, firms like
Courtaulds are thinking of establishing
their Australian headquarters in Victoria,
South Australia or Queensland despite
the magnificent coal that exists —under-
ground—in N. S. Wales.
11l winds? It was reported last week
that N.S.W. industries could expect extra
coal allocations. The largesse was not
the result of increased output as a result
of the Ashley-McGirr cave-in to miners’
demands. It was simply that a marine
pilots’ strike had held up inter-State ship-
ments —some of the colliers are chartered
vessels whose skippers are not exempt for
Newcastle. In the present state of the
coal industry in New South Wales no
consumer can get more coal without
someone else getting less.
In an Encyclical Letter the Lambeth
Conference of Anglican bishops has
spoken out strongly against the “new
menace of Marxian Communism.” The
menace is by no means new, but things
move slowly in the Church, and it is 18
years since the last Conference. The
divines at that time probably decided to
be tolerant and give the Soviet time to
prove itself, but they now have no doubt
as to the nature of the beast, or of the
“cruelties and injustice inherent in Com-
munism.” The Encyclical will be read
in 100 different languages from pulpits
all over the world. Among those who
will hear it in English will be Dr. Hewlett
Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, whose
Socialist Sixth of the World is quoted
by fellow-travellers everywhere as proof
that the Soviet system is not inconsistent
with Christianity. Actually, all the book
proves is that there is no fool like a fat-
headed churchman. Bishop Burgmann,
author of The Faith of an Anglican, will
also be interested in the Letter’s com-
ment :
Marxian Communism exalts atheism,
puts supreme confidence in material pro-
gress and proclaims its gospel with a mili-
tant enthusiasm which expects to conquer
the world.
T.A.A. confesses to a loss of £270,000
for the year ended June 30. The Gov-
ernment show is in a peculiar position ;
if A.N.A. wins its High Court case on
route fees the Airlines Commission will
also benefit to the tune of £140,000, but
as the fees were imposed to help T.A.A.
run the private air companies out of
business the Coles concern won’t get
much comfort out of that.
Those Victorians who felt like it spent
the week-end poring over maps of
the new Federal 'electorates which the
Chifley crowd proposes for them. Mel-
bourne “Argus” believes that “generally
the redistribution does not alter the party
strength,” and that 12 of the 33 seats
will be “swingers” in future elections.
The city gets eight of the 13 new seats —
called Bridges, Darebin, Gellibrand, Gor-
don, Hoddle, Hotham, Lonsdale and
Wills; and the country gets Mallee
(Ouyen, Swan Hill, Mildura districts),
Barkly (Upper Goulburn Valley, Echuca,
mid-Murray), Latrobe (around Dan-
denong), McMillan (south-west Gipps-
land; Korumburra, Morwell, Warragul)
and Phillip (narrow strip running from
Geelong north to about Seymour). All
States have been promised maps by Sept.
2, after which the real arguments will
begin. The whole thing was called “a
low Labor intrigue” (B. 28/4/’4B), and
low it remains, especially on the Senate
aspect wherein Senators’ terms are to be
arbitrarily altered without regard to the
Constitution or the pressing need for new
States. And the farce of giving Tasmania
10 Senators to five Reps, is still on the
programme.
P. H. Quirke, the Adelaide “Labor”
M.H.A. who was disqualified for a year
by the A.L.P. because he agreed with the
Australian people on the prices refer-
endum, has come out flat for new States;
At one time I thought we had too many
Governments in Australia, but I think
differently now. It is much easier for sub-
versive elements to destroy one Govern-
ment than several. X wish power to remain
with the States, and I can no longer sup-
port Labor’s policy of unification.
Quirke also believes that Communists
stand a good chance of destroying
“Labor” unless “Labor” gets as far away
from Socialism as it can. Next year it
will be driven away.
Clive Evatt will be set a poser if the
A.L.P. accepts the belated recommenda-
tion of its executive committee that the
Australian-Russian Society be declared a
Communist auxiliary,, Bert’s young
brother, and president of the show, Clive
told the N.S.W. Assembly it was lilywhite
and protested that he was being perse-
cuted. “My family protected this coun-
try in the First World War,” he said,
and added, greatly daring—“l was
in uniform when I was 17.” That
the details of the military service
of Citizen Trainee Bert Evatt and of
Duntroon-cadet Clive Evatt should be
widely published has long , been the wish
of thousands of citizens who did fight
for Australia, and have never understood
why the records of Bert and Clive have
so persistently escaped the limelight.
U.N.O. was given its biggest laugh of
the year last week when the Ukrainian
delegate, following the lead of his Russian
master, opposed the admission of Ceylon
on the ground that Ukraine “was'not
convinced that Ceylon’s Independence
Act of 1947 gave real independence.”
Justice Cantor described the strike of
Sydney and Newcastle pilots as “wanton
and wicked,” and the censure was just.
The 20 pilots who deserted their post are
men of mature years and experience, in
whom training and professional pride
should have bred a respect for . the law
and a sense of responsibility. They struck
not on any point of high principle, but
for more dough, and less work; their
present salary is £920 a year and more
‘ than half of their 52-hour week is wait-
ing-time. The power of a bad example
is strong, and it is a thousand pities that
men with a good record of public service
should take their cue from Red-ruled
miners and wharfies. But it is at least
understandable. After all, the pilots have
seen “leaders” of Governments, State and
Federal, taking their orders from the
same tainted source.
J. A. Ferguson, president of the N. S,
Wales A.L.P., has issued a stem minute
warning A.L.P. members against associa-
tion with Communists, particularly with
“undercover” leaders such as the New
Housewives’ Association. Presumably as
an earnest of how far it intends itself
to be taken seriously the N. S. Wales
“Labor” party, two days before the minute
was issued, elected to the Legislative
Council J. D. Kenny, Assistant-Secretary
of the N.S.W. Labor Council, who was
one of the signatories to the radio sent
the previous week demanding that U.N.O-
should take action to deal with the United
States authorities. who have dared to
arrest every leader of the Communist
party they can catch. Every other signa-
tory to the radio was either a Communist
or an official of a Communist-controlled
union, with all union officials on the
Central Committee of the Communist
party thrown in.
When Parliament reopens Mr. Chifley
will no doubt be asked questions about
Australia’s official reaction to the revalua-
tion of the New Zealand pound. Another
currency mystery remains unanswered,
that of why $1,189,110 was allocated to
Metropolitan Portland Cement, Ltd,, for
the purchase of second-hand American
plant when Australian industry as a whole
is finding coal and labor supplies and
transport facilities inadequate to keep
present plant fully occupied. Exactly
why has “the Commonwealth Govern-
ment” “attached” so much “importance
(quoted words from the co.’s prospectus)
to the “industry” that it has sponsored
such a huge allocation of dollars? Ray-
mond G. Hamilton, N.S.W. “Labor”
M.L.A. for Namoi and a director of
Metropolitan Cement, so far hasn’t ex-
plained what “freight advantages” over
other producers of cement are to be
allowed the co. by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment railways.
Hanlon’s comment on -the “anony-
mous” fine-money is worth quoting:
The people who paid the fines were
apparently concerned only with the big fel-
lows. The two men left in jail are only
ordinary workers.
The Communists are interested in “the
ordinary worker” only for what they can
get out of him.
It is reported that Mr. Chifley proposes
to buy time on a B-class station radio
network to give a weekly report to the
nation. The fact that he is not using the
National stations shows either that he
believes that they don’t reach the people
or that they won’t let him speak because
his “talks” will be purely electioneering
propaganda, for which, of course, the
taxpayers will pay. The doctrine of
Ministerial responsibility is almost dead.

New Acting Prices Commissioner for
N.S.W. C. J. Bellemore is a man with a
message—don’t blow complaints about
prices down his ear after hours at home.
He had enough of that when, the butt of
abuse from every hard-done-by citizen
in the State, he directed its manpower
for three war-years. Still, he admits
one Reverend Mother of a convent had
grounds for complaint. A girl checking
registry-cards noticed a woman’s occu-
pation as “nun.” Correcting what she
thought to be illiteracy, she altered it to
"none.” Bellemore’s edict duly went out,
and the convent was not amused. His
best collection effort was to rake up in
one day 5000 men for the building of
Tocumwal aerodrome: best effort at dis-
persion was when he walked into a
packed bar at five to six. The barmaid
recognised him, and in three minutes he
was drinking with the flies.
Director of the Australian War Graves
Commission, Brigadier A. E. Brown has
seen more of the world than most men.
With over 200,000 graves in his charge,
determined to see they are cared for as
well as the best cemeteries overseas, he
needs to travel. On a recent tour, after
the dedication of Tobruk cemetery, he
visited the last resting-places of Australia's
sons on Gallip. and in Britain, France,
Belgium and Italy. A firm disbeliever in
remote-control, Brown periodically in-
spects his charges in s.-e. Asia, Japan,
Hong Kong, Borneo, the Philippines,
Amboina, New Guinea and New Britain.
An A.I.F. gunner in 1939, a lieutenant
two years later, he was knocked about in
the Middle East and given a spell in Mel-
bourne, where he joined his present show.
Young-looking for his 43 years, alert and
active. Brown’s intense interest in the
graves makes him intolerant of ineffi-
ciency found on his sudden visits. But to
anyone sharing his interest he is, as his
offsider in Sydney says, “the sort of bloke
you couldn’t let down.”
With the Bank Grab case in his
satchel, Garfield Barwick, K.C., a leading
light among Australian barristers, has a
recipe for success—hard work and good
luck. Retained by the banks if the Privy
Council grants the Commonwealth leave
to appeal, he will also act for wheat-
growers in their heavy claim on the
Federal Government. Barwick was
schooled at Crown-street and Fort-street
High, won a Sydney Uni. medal in law in
1925, and has been steadily climbing
since he took silk two years later. He is
one of the handful of counsel for whom
there is always a dive when big issues are'
involved. A keen skier and member of
the Kosciusko Park Trust, he will take a
brief for the snow country on the slightest
provocation.
When Commander Neil Mackinnon,
R.A.N., assumes his next appointment as
executive officer of cruiser Australia, he
will be back in the ship in which he
served as a sub. in 1928. Most interest-
ing part of 29 years’ service was his
spell as flag-lieutenant to Rear-Admiral
(now Admiral) E. R. G. R. Evans (of the
Broke). During the war Mackinnon cap-
tained destroyers Stuart and Warramunga,
in the latter collecting an American award
of the Legion of Merit. A signals expert,
he commanded the Flinders signal school
at a time when bunting-tossers were
urgently needed for fleet work at sea.
Mackinnon’s present chief, Captain H.
M. Burrell, R.A.N., will remain his chief
as captain of Australia.
A 47-year-old war wound received
attention at the Repatriation Clinic in
Melbourne the other day. Its possessor
was Jim Rogers, the only surviving Boer
War V.C. in Australia. Enlisting from the
Riverina, he went to S. Africa as a
sergeant in the Victorian Mounted Rifles.
Rescuing comrades under fire earned him
his decoration, and subsequent service
gained him a commission. A beggar for
punishment, he joined up again in World
War I and served with the First Division.
After farming for a lifetime in the Mallee
he retired to Melbourne, and a few
months ago broke his leg in a fall in his
garden, contracted pneumonia and later
sprained his ankle. But it was his South
African wound which took him to
Repat.
Most promising aspect of America’s
new Ambassador here, Myron Cowen, is
his insistence that Australia, not merely
Canberra, is his headquarters. He wants
to see as much of it as soon as he can,
in the process listening more than talking.
Considering that expanding commercial
relations and restoring normal Pacific
communications will be among his most
important jobs, Cowen holds buoyant
hopes for the Australian wool and
woollen-cloth market in the U.S. This
view confirms the report of an Australian
woman lately returned from the U.S. that
Americans were amazed at the quality
of wool she took over with her. A quiet
but active man, lawyer, collector of Old
English silver, china and porcelain, and a
good horseman, Cowen should be received
well by the people he hopes to meet.
Nobody was more interested in the
launching of the new Battle-class destroyer
Anzac at Williamstown (Vic.), by Mrs.
J A. Collins, wife of the First Naval
Member, than Engineer-Captain Charles
Carr Clark, manager of the dockyard;
he had watched the ship grow since its
keel was laid in September, 1946. Born
at Warwick, Queensland, and educated at
Jervis Bay Naval College, Clark was chief
engineer of cruiser Australia in the Leyte,
Lingayen and Philippine operations, and
gained an 0.8. E. and D.S.C. on his job
during the ship’s bombardments and in
attacks by suicide bombers. Thirteen
when he joined the Navy, he has seen 33
years’ service.
It might be an exaggeration to say that
Bill Little, a little man with a great love
of Australia, caught momentarily
stationary by Scorfield, knows every stick
of property in the Cloncurry district of
N.Q. —but not much of an overstatement.
A land-court advocate and property
valuer. Little has just completed a 12-
months inspection tour covering 22,000
square miles for Cloncurry Shire Council.
Born in Thornborough, on the Hodgkin-
son River (N.Q.), he has travelled the
north for over 40 years, knows its value
and knows its men ; which may be the
BILL LITTLE, from N. Queensland.
reason the pet subject of his versatile
tongue is a vehement belief in Australia
and the Empire. A favorite story con-
cerns his only son, Bill, a flying-officer
who lost his life in a Spitfire over the
Adriatic. When in the city Bill —like all
his breed a quiet lad—was sneeringly
referred to by a Com, as a “bluebird,”
What the home-fronter didn’t discern was
that Bill was a boxer; but he realised it
when he sprawled in the' gutter. The
father is proud that his son was the first
North Queenslander to be selected for
the Empire Air Training Scheme.
When Charlie Dearden, publicity
manager for J.C.W., boarded the Orontes
at Fremantle recently to welcome
maestro Franco Ghione, here pictured by
Mcßeath, he wondered how he would
find him amongst the 2000 passengers
from the description “slight of build,
sallow complexion, blue eyes, flowing hair
and no English.” But the conductor of
many seasons at La Scala, Milan, and
Royal Opera House, Rome, was an easy
mark; —he looks every inch an artist. The
highlight of his long career in the theatre
FRANCO GHIONE,
of the Italian Opera.
was when he was selected to conduct the
first performance in Italy of Puccini’s
“Turandot.” In addition to conducting
in the above-listed homes of opera the
maestro has waved the baton through
many opera seasons in U.S. and South
America. As artistic-director and senior
conductor of the current frenzy at
His Majesty’s, Melbourne, he will super-
vise a different opera each night during
the whole season. Everything so far in
Australia has been “magnifico” for
Signor Ghione —the climate, magnifico
—the people, the scenery, magnifico, mag-
nifico. A charming blonde wife accom-
panies him — magnifico, too.
Commodore Sir Charles George Mathe-
son, D. 5.0., R.N.V.R., who died two
months ago in England , and whose ashes,
according to his wish, were scattered, the
other day on Australian waters, had a
long association with Australia’s coast. He
made landfalls in windjammers before he
joined the Orient Co., and as commander
of the Oronsay served on the Australian
run. He gained the D.S.O. for his ex-
ploits in World War I on “Q” ships,
described in his book Fifty Years of
Ocean Hazard. In 1918 he became Orient
Co. commander, retiring in 1938 to rejoin
the R.N. on the outbreak of the second
scrap. In 1931 he was A.D.C. to King
George V. His ashes were scattered
from the bridge of the Orion when she
sailed from Melbourne for Sydney. An
old shipmate, Commodore Sir A. J.
Baxter, master of the Orion, performed
the office.
Appointed Regional Director of Civil
Aviation in Perth, Group-Captain D.
Ross entered Jervis Bay Naval College

came a flying instructor. Subsequently
superintendent of civil-aviation flying
operations, and' in 1941 acting chief-

which supplied troops in the island
campaigns. After the war he went back
to civil aviation as Superintendent of Air
Navigation, which job he was still hold-
ing when appointed to his present post in
Perth.
A Queen steps down:
Serenity is the outward characteristic of
Holland’s Queen Wilhelmina, stepping down
from her throne at the end of the month.
But it hides a nature that is forthright, deter-
mined and, as proved by her opening of Hol-
land’s neutral frontiers to thousands of First
War refugees, motherly. Wilhelmina is often
compared with Queen Victoria. Both came
to the throne young; both married German
consorts; and both reigned long and success-
fully, outliving their husbands. When the Nazis
invaded her country the Queen, despite the
propaganda ammunition she knew it would
afford her enemies, decided on flight to Eng-
land, to help, if possible, her people from
there.' The Nazis were quick to brand her a
deserter, but when, month after month, Wil-
helmina’s firm voice sounded from Station
Orange, urging her people to new faith and
courage, they saw the practicality of her chosen
exile. When she returned after the surrender,
her reception by her usually undemonstrative
countrymen brought tears to her eyes. The
Queen was a competent administrator and
fostered many social reforms; among them
franchise for women, educational reforms which
reduced Holland’s illiteracy rate to Europe’s
lowest level, and her interest in aviation
encouraged the formation of K.L.M., now a
world air-route. Her conservatism in dress
is widely known, and daughter Juliana’s public
appearance behind powder and lipstick made
world news. With the wealthy East Indies
demanding self-government, Princess Juliana
assumes control at the Dutch Empire’s most
crucial time in its history. She can be assured
of support from the Grand Lady who for 58
years has held that Empire together and has
seen it survive worse foes than those snarling
at it today. •
Most servicemen in the last scrap
divorced themselves from their civilian
jobs, and Englishman W. H. Gibbs, new
chairman of Kitchen’s, the soap people,
did it thoroughly. He commanded a mine-
sweeping flotilla in the North Sea, and a
cavorting corvette in those waters rates
toilet soap low on its supply list. Join-
ing the R.N. in 1940 as an A. 8., he
was commissioned nine months later,
captained a sweeper and took his experi-
ence on to command of the flotilla, col-
lecting a D.S.C. and “mention.” His
vice is gardening, which he indulges in
a newly-bought property on Hunter’s Hill.
His wife and children recently joined him
from the Orion.
Retired from the Salvation Army, 85-
year-old Colonel J. H. Bray, friend of
thousands of first-offenders at Mel-
bourne’s courts. He devoted 60 years of
his life to saving prospective criminals,
mostly youngsters. His proudest “save”
was a 45-year-old habitual criminal
who had done time in five countries. Bray
secured his release, and the man has since
gone straight. Like most welfare workers,
Bray blames parents and not children for
juvenile crime.

Attending the Empire Parliamentary
Association conference in London,
Ferdinand Parker, Clerk of Parliaments
in S.A., is the senior official of the associa-
tion in Australia —he has been secretary
of the S.A. branch since 1925. His first
acquaintance with Parliamentary pro-
cedure was gained as clerk-assistant of
the Assembly in 1920; he has held his
present post since 1937. Chairman of the
S.A. Institute of Public Administration
and the Historical Memorials Committee
of S.A. and a former president of the
State branch of the Royal Geographical
Society, he was an A.I.F. captain on
Gallipoli.
Into the silence:
In Melbourne, at 81, Samuel Cooke. Bom
in Northern Ireland, he played international
soccer before coming to Australia in the
’nineties, when he joined the Union Trustee
Co., finishing as g.-m.
In Sydney, at 68, Dr. Percival Cole, vice-
principal of Sydney Teachers’ College for 30
years. He was visiting Carnegie Professor of
International Relations at the University of
Hawaii and Washington, 1929, and Australian
representative of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
In Melbourne, Ron Testro, the “Uncrowned
King of Poverty Point.” When legit, was in
its heyday and actors from 11 theatres used
to converge on Saturday nights to the pavement
in front of the Orient Hotel, his dignified
figure was always prominent, except during the
eight years when he toured the world as a
juggler with his wife, Ruby Stevens, a ballet-
gitl from the Royal. He played with Harry
Rickards, Bland Holt and most of the old-
timers and was a Bijou star for many years.
In Adelaide, at 82, Walter Grenfell Thomas,
member of Adelaide Stock Exchange. He
began his commercial career thereabouts 70
years ago, was one-time chief clerk of Elder
Smith and Co. and later manager of the
Chateau Tanunda Distilleries.
In Melbourne, at 55, Dr. John Whyte Grieve,
one of Melbourne’s leading children’s specialists
and a fdrmer superintendent of the Children’s
Hospital. He served with the A.I.F. in the
1914-18 War.
At Toowoomba (Q.), at 70, Robert Blaxland
Lightbody, descendant of Blaxland the ex-
plorer. He served overseas with the Ist A.I.F.
in the 6th Field Ambulance, and was a prac-
tical Christian.
At Wagga, at 79, George Tallis, whose long
association with J.C.W. began when the Firm
was Williamson, Garner and Musgrove, and
he was 17. In 1913 he became chairman of
directors. He retired from the theatre in 1931,
but remained connected with a string of com-
mercial enterprises. He was born in County
Kilkenny.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Zake”; The Federal Government pro-
poses the special minting of a 45.-piece
to commemorate the Royal tour next
year. If issued, the coins will no doubt
achieve the same popularity among the
public as the five-bob “cartwheels”
minted for King George V s silver
jubilee. These were put to only one use
—the ignominious one of change for the
ss. tote windows at Randwick and Flem-
ington. There are few in circulation now
—the Yanks souvenired most of ’em. Ihe
trouble with big coins is that they wear
trouser-pockets out too quickly. No in-
dication has been given of any change in
the set-up for the proposed four-bobber,
though it would be a graceful gesture
to Dr. Herbert Vere to have, instead of
the emu and the Too, his brother Clive
and Uncle Joe shaking the hand of friend-
ship over the slogan “Russia and Us”
on the reverse side. The coin would
naturally have a milled edge, in deference
to the milling among the herds of “Labor”
politicians to get at the head of the
queue whenever another trip abroad is
mentioned. But why a four-bob piece,
.anyway? Surely Hanlon and McGirr,
whose lott’ries are the only things they
run that haven’t gone broke, have suffi-
cient imagination to see the advantages of
a ss. 6d. coin, and will bring pressure
to bear on the big Chif.—and who is Ben
to resist pressure from that quarter?

“Clooter”: The rash of Shakspeare on
the face of Sydney will quickly heal now
that the Old Vic. Company has ended
its season, and, thank heavens % there’ll
be an end to the nuisances who’ve been
setting themselves up as authorities on
the Bard and all his works. One of the
worst is the person who, at the drop of
a hat, can produce statistics, usually
gathered from “quiz sessions” or adver-
tisements, showing how many times
Shakspeare used a Biblical quotation, the
word “bawdy” or a witch. One of the
breed actually produced a treatise called
“Shakspeare and Occultism,” though
whether to prove that the dramatist be-
lieved in astrology or was a foundation
member of the Sect of the Seven Spirits
1 don’t know. The earnest chap com-
pletely overlooked the fact that, since
Shakspeare. was writing period pieces
when not doing fantasies, he had to
people the stories with ghosts, belief in
omens and so forth because his characters
lived in an era when practically every-
body believed in them. All the same,
the British Council has done good work
in stimulating interest in the greatest
figure of English literature. When the
excitement dies down and all those who
temporarily deserted Gerty Babel and
Peggory Geek for the Oliviers return to
their former loves, not only will the
genuine Shakspeare devotees have
memories to fondle, but a worthy leaven
of new disciples will have been estab-
lished. To my mind, the rather astonish-
ing fact emerges that the film is a better
medium than the legitimate stage for
bringing Shakspeare to life.

“Oxmead”: Have noticed in tobac-
conists’ shops lately the caption “Pipes
guaranteed for two years.” Of coufse
the guarantee is worth little or nothing.
but the assumption that the normal life
of a good brier pipe is as short as that is
sheer nonsense. Personally, I’m still
smoking pre-war pipes, and shall con-
tinue doing so till the prices go down. A
man can get as attached to his favorite
pipe as to his walking-stick, his gun or
anything else, and there is no reason why
it shouldn’t last as long. The most strik-
ing instance of such attachment I recall
is that of a murderer who was convicted
and hanged in Perth some 40 years ago.
His final request before he went to the
gallows was that his pipe, evidently the
cherished friend of many years, should
be buried with him. It was.

“Noon Bey”: Postage-stamp errors (B.
28/7/’48)? The old British New Guinea
stamps with their hand-engraved lakatoi
centres showed a number of variations ;
postmarks in that country also varied.
At Nepa, Lakekamu, in 1910, my newly-
opened post-office was given an old date-
stamp with the name of the original office
excised, but “British New Guinea” re-
mained. Apparently some fancy mark-
ing was done with this stamp, and about
1935, when living in India, I received a
letter from an American asking if I could
explain this and that. Soon after that 1
had a letter from the chief postmaster
at Moresby with sample impressions of
“It’s quite a simple operation—I'll show you where they whipped
mine out”
old date-stamps, asking which was the
one in use when I opened the office. He
didn’t send an impression of the large
upper-case “R” in a circle that I had
cut out of a whisky cork to stamp
registered letters.
* * * *
“Ray Whiting”; Does anyone know
who wrote those brilliant verses “O
Farida gib it backsheesh” that we sang
so lustily to the tune of the Gyppo
national anthem? If he’s still around I
wish he’d do something similar with
“Advance Australia Fair,” that dreadful
pet of Calwell and the Commos. A
parody with the pungent drollery of
“Farida” would rapidly sweep the
country, until every time the A.B.C.
played the thing such a roar of ribald
laughter would rock the nation that the
bilious ditty would be ridiculed off the
air.

“X.S.”: Calling a policeman a mug in
N.S.W. has proved an expensive pastime,
and calling a Melbourne policewoman a
“copper tart” cost a youth £2, alternative
seven days’ jail. Mohr, P.M., said the
penalty would have been greater if the
repentant young man hadn’t made an
abject apology to the insulted lady.
* * * •
“Macnell”: With 32-year-old Renown
gone to the breakers, the R.N. has now
no battle-cruisers. With a battleship’s
armament, a much greater speed—3H
knots —but not so heavily armored, the
class combined the hitting-power of a
battle-line with a cruiser’s speed. When
modified in 1939, Renown mounted six
15in. guns in twin turrets, 20 4.5 in. dual-
purpose quickfirers, nests of light A.A.
weapons and four aircraft for recco-
spotting. For all her 32,000 tons she
was a graceful ship. Nearly 800 ft. long,
her rakish, upswept bow and low stern
gave her a look of lean strength lacking
in the harsh ugliness of battleships. Aus-
tralians knew her well —she brought the
Prince of Wales here on his world tour
in 1920 (Admiral Mountbatten was one
of his As.D.C), and was back again in
1927 with the King and Queen, as Duke
and Duchess of York, to open Parliament
House in Canberra. Three years ago in
Plymouth Sound the King was aboard
again,- meeting President Truman.
Renown’s best war-time gunnery effort
was to score a hit on Scharnhorst at nine-
miles range in heavy weather and snow-
storms. She collected two shells in re-
turn, one of which pierced her waterline
without exploding, the other carrying
away her main W/T aerial.
* * * •
“Pongo”: Years agone, when the
P.M.G. paid newsagents and stationers a
commission for selling postage-stamps, the
department was puzzled at the discovery
that agents operating quite close to some
busy suburban offices often sold twice as
many stamps as the post-office. The ex-
planation was simple: Shopkeepers were
passing over their quota to counter-hands
at the P. 0., who sold them and split the
commission.

“Flathead”: “The best brains of the
Army” not being able to cope with the
Digger’s liking to hurl blue-metal at every
train-stop (B. 18/8/’4B) is not at all sur-
prising, and confirms the feeling that came
to me on route-marching or pot-walloping
occasions, that any gentleman possessing
a brasshat and claiming that it concealed
anything tangible was to be regarded with
suspicion. The blue-metal question is
probably one of simple psychology going
back to the troops’ training days. It was
a favorite wheeze of exasperated n.c.os.
whose bullring was within a mile of a
railway-line to send misbehaving recruits
doubling down to it with the order to
bring back a handful of blue-metal. If
that alone was not sufficient to give such
recruits a permanent hate-complex against
the stuff, then the n.c.o.’s big joke, when
the panting warrior returned with the
rocks, would settle it. “What do
you mean by pinching Government
property?” the corporal would bellow.
“Take it back!”
* * * *
“Agamemnon”: “Pawang’s” guess (B.
4/ 8 / ’4B) about acquired immunity to
’flu is wide of the mark. Immunity
to ’flu is extremely transitory, and the
credit for the low death-rate in the recent
epidemic rests with improved general
health conditions and the new drugs.
Immunity to bacterial disease is trans-
mitted to the offspring in relatively few
diseases and then only through the
mother’s first milk. Such protection is
short-lived and seldom extends through
childhood, never to subsequent genera-
tions. The apparent immunity of Orien-
tals to endemic diseases such as smallpox
is due to the gradual elimination of the
susceptible population generation after
generation. The survivors, naturally resis-
tant to the disease, tend to transmit this
factor to their descendants, but many
generations are required to produce a
resistant population.

“Chevroford”: Melbourne’s streets
used to show.a great diversity of trans-
port, from beer-lorries drawn by glorious
teams of Clydesdales to the small donkey-
pulled coster’s cart once favored by a pie-
man. Nowadays there is drab uniformity
of trucks, trailers, limousines and lizzies
which seem to me to move no faster than
the horse-vehicles of the past. Wherefore
my heart leapt up like Wordsworth’s the
other morning when 1 saw a man seated
side-saddle on a packing-case on small
wheels speeding along Collins-street at
a fast pace, his propelling force being
his left leg which he pushed vigorously
against the road. Unbothered by petrol
shortages, high cost of motor upkeep,
wheel tax, licences and whatnot, he had
solved the transport problem, and the
ease and mobility of his manipulation of
the traffic was a wonder to see. A little
later I was talking to a man who for 18
months has been kept from starting busi-
I ess because a utility van, even if obtain-
ble, is beyond his purse. The packing-
ase proprietor was an example of the
arvival of the fittest.

“Fizz”: The dangers of drinjdng
inger-ale, even when diluted with
ghter-fluid, may be great (B. 4/8/’4B),
ut how much more to be feared is
/ater! A Liverpool woman recently,
uietly sitting in her bath, drank 10
lasses of water and died. The verdict
vas suicide. Now, had those drinks
>een beer, would she have died? And
tad she died, would that have been
uicide?

“Gravelsnatcher”: A motorist’s dream
:ame true for a Perth man recently when
le sued a traffic-cop for damages in-
:urred when the cop’s motor-cycle piled
nto the back of his car. The cop ad-
nitted speeding, but claimed that the
notorist was also at fault. The magisr
rate took time off to consider the case,
hen awarded damages. He held that
he motorist was wrong, but the cop was
more wrong.

“H.A.L.”: It happened 25 years ago.
1 wanted a felt hat; nothing expensive,
but the type that looked well enough
when worn and which wouldn’t break
you if you lost it. I went into Sydney’s
swankiest men’s store and said, “I want
a new Stetson,” using the current slang
for any form of felt hat. The close imi-
tation of Bond-street tailoring put on his
best salesman’s manner. With reverent
care he drew forth an affair the pile of
which suggested that it was plush instead
of felt and held it up on his left hand for
me to see and admire. As one who men-
tioned an inconsiderable trifle, he mur-
mured that it was three guineas. I re-
plied that I wanted something a bit
cheaper. I said the same thing with the
next three hats he brought out; then he
inquired, “Just how much did you ex-
pect to pay for a Stetson?” And never
shall I forget the stricken look on his
face when I said, “Oh, about ten bob.”
Mastering his feelings by - a powerful
effort of will, he found a hat which
suited me, then remarked, as he handed
me my change, “The type of hat you re-
quired, Sir, is known as the Woolloo-
mooloo Stetson.”
* * ♦ *
“Hamfat”: On the stage it is the cat
that usually gets the laughs that dogs earn
on the cricket-field (B. 11/8/’4B). In the
Opera House, Auckland, a puss walked
on in the middle of a drawing-room scene
when the heroine was at the piano, back
to the audience, singing. As the cat pro-
ceeded to sample the chairs for comfort
the actress on the stage caught the con-
tagion of mirth from the audience, and
the lady at the piano, half-turning and
seeing the cause, doubled-up with
laughter. Then the “house” got its greatest
laugh, for although the supposed song-
stress was helpless with laughter the song
continued. We had engaged a local prima
donna to sing off-stage, and unconscious
of the hitch she was conscientiously
carrying on.
# • ♦ •
“Dusty Mile”: Modification of funeral
customs (B. 28/7/’4B) has not dimmed
the undertaker’s pride in his work. My
friend Sinkem, his professional pride
excited at the conclusion of a “nice job,’
led me to the rear of his workshop and
showed me an elegant coffin. “Isn t she
a beaut?” he murmured reverently.
“Modelled after the latest American
idea.” He stroked it. “It’s for old So-
and-so.” “No, he’s not dead yet,” he
added, noting my surprise, “but he will
be, and he’ll want something nice when
he goes. This coffin will just ‘make’ the
whole show.”
* * ♦ •
“Bumpkin”: I am in wholehearted
agreement with “W.F.G.” in his sugges-
tion (B. 11/8/’4B) that old colonial build-
ings should be preserved and, when times
become more normal, re-erected in some
spacious setting. In Melbourne there are
dozens of old pubs, woolstores, bond-
stores and private dwellings whose pro-
I portions are just as good as some of the
most famous manorhouses of England,
though, of course, they lack the carving
and embellishments put on by craftsmen
of the Middle Ages. For years I rented
an old house in the heart of the city
the fa9ade of which was a perfect example
of Georgian architecture. It has, alas, long
since gone to the wreckers and now forms
part of the Williamstown breakwater,
though I tried hard to arouse official in-
terest in it. At the bottom end of Little
Collins-street there is a hotel which, it
pulled down and re-erected in a park out-
side the city, would make a grand “gentle-
man’s residence,” and a recently-con-
demned bondstore would make a stately
museum, art gallery or a school. If any
of our millionaires want to be remem-
bered they could build a wonderful town
out of Melbourne’s detritus, and the
same can be said of Sydney.
THESE UPPER HOUSES.
“Members of the N.S.W. Legislative Council, till
now unpaid, are soon to receive an ‘allowance’ of
£3OO a year; Victorian Ms.L.O. are to have their
annual remuneration raised from £350 to £750. ’
These men of light and leading in the nation,
Folks of comparatively high degree,
These bulwarks hasty legislation,
As for so‘ long they were assumed to be,
Time was they would have scorned remuneration
Which took the sordid form of £ s. d.,
And felt annoyed if anyone had made
The bare suggestion that they should be paid.
How diffTent now, wtyen lawmaking is graded
As much a gainful trade as laying bricks,
And nobody is like to be persuad ;d
To butt his carcass into politics
By no financial inducement aided,
Or do so onerous a job for nix;
And year by rolling year the numbers grow
Of those in line for Parliamentary dough.
When Reps and Senators are found assessing
Their annual worth at what it stands today,
We listen to State Upper Houses stressing
A trifle more should come their humble way,
And Premiers benignly acquiescing,
Though, more than likely, theie’U be some
to say .
And plenty more to back it with a bet:
“They’ll only want the more, the more they
get.”
Our case for M.L.Cs. is manifested
Beyond all precedent that Britain affords;
We make no bones at seeing them invested
With far from negligible cash rewards.
And, though I’ve never seen it yet suggested
The Motherland should pay its House of
Lords,
It looks a scheme for which we may prepare
When Labor peers become more numeious
there.

“Cauboy”: In the next few weeks an
orgy of slaughter will occur in Melbourne.
At least one soprano will die of con-
sumption, another will go rpad and slay
her husband, a third will be murdered,
put in a sack and dumped in a river, a
fourth will take poison and her lover will
be executed, half a dozen tenors will
suicide or be bumped off in one way or'
another, and at least two lovers will be
walled up in a tomb and left to die of
starvation. In no case will the loverlike
relation be presented nor will any attempt
be made to show how these things work
out in marriage. None of the great lovers
of history, from Tristan and Isolde to
Nicolette and Aucassin, were ever tested
out in the marriage mill.
* * * «
“Bo”: Franz Liszt, with his flam-
boyant amours (B. 11/8/’4B), was a pro-
duct of his age—that early-to-middle
nineteenth century when romanticism was
coming into full flower. Consider some
of those figures in the liberal arts who
fired it: Byron, the passion of whose
“Don Juan” was flooding Europe, whose
“affairs” were notorious, whose very
death —in the cause of Greek freedom—
was suffused with romanticism; Berlioz
—“mad Hector of the flaming locks”—
who wrote his revolutionary Fantastic
Symphony to gain the attention of the
Irish actress Henrietta Smithson, and
whose long and stormy courtship of that
lady, as fantastic as his symphony, ended
in a marriage even more agonising than
his courtship and who went on to fall
desperately in love five more times until,
an old man, he unsuccessfully sought to
rekindle the first love of his youth. Then
there were Dumas and Gautier, whose
“The towel, Arthur, not the soap!"
passionate romanticism was never con-
fined to the pages they wrote ; Heine, the
German poet, who “sneered and wept in
the same couplet”; Rousseau, Chau-
briand. Prosper Merimee, Stendahl; the
painters Delacroix and Corot; Schumann
and Mendelssohn, two of the few to keep
their private romances within bounds. But
it was an age when the romantic affair was
flaunted with a high degree of extrava-
gant exhibitionism. The poet De Musset
confessed that, after the much-loved
novelist “Georges Sand” had left him and
sought consolation in the arms of the
Italian Dr. Pagello, he shut himself up
in his room for four months and was in
incessant tears throughout. Those were
the days of the “grand passion”!
* * * *
“Dong”: Opposite my house lie two
enviable paddocks of couch-grass on
which spherica| gentlemen play bowls.
Until the players head into the clubhouse
for tea the game is conducted with abso-
lute decorum; afterwards, the happy
yelps, victorious leaps, and occasional
bursts of cheering suggest that the “tea”
is headier stuff than comes in packets.
As against this entertainment value there
is a drawback to the bowling club in the
shape of a loudspeaker liable to burst out
with “Attention, please! ” at any time, and
calculated, sooner or later, to affect
mentally the neighboring householders.
Happily this loudspeaker has had only the
minimum of use since last Saturday, when
the lights in the clubhouse were burning
merrily long after 6 p.m. One of the
members must have accidentally bumped
the microphone switch; there was some
static, and then, over the inimitable clink,
and murmur of happy bowlers, the club’s
president came loud and clear: “There’s
another nine down there, Bert. Roll her
up, will you?” There followed confused
muttering of “She’s switched on!”—an-
other click, then silence. The last car
had just driven off when the local
sergeant, also a bowler when off duty,
arrived.

“Cap P.”: This is the season when a
journey through Sydney’s northern
suburbs is a delightful experience. Every
flowering shrub is dressed in glory, im-
ported brooms and native acacias flaunt-
ing their colors among the sombre green
of the gums. The pinks and whites of
flowering peach and plum shed a glamor
over corners and catch the afternoon sun-
light from skies washed clear of smoke
and ha ie by the keen westerly breeze.
The birds are busy about their nesting
and the triumphant liquid gold of mag-
pies ripples down from the gums over the
fairy music of reed-warblers and wild
canaries. Down the side-roads the banks
and gullies are* bright with* the purple,
red, white and gold of wild heaths, and
here and there, through gaps in the trees
stands out a golden square of daffodils
in somebody’s garden. Later, when the
heat comes, lantana and pigface and
nasturtiums will cascade their riot of
color over fences and rockeries, but just
now the district is dressed in the first
tender colors of spring, the bold, warm
gold of wattle the most vigorous note
of all.

“Laetitia”: In the records of a Queens-
land Government department is a docu-
ment which, though only 10 years old,
has already assumed the status of an
archive. It is the copy of a reply to a
German Consular official whose letter of
inquiry had been terminated with the
tag “Heil Hitler!” The Queensland
official, instead of employing the formal
“Yours faithfully” ending, closed his
reply “Heil Forgan Smith!”

“Plop”: “So you’re taking driving
lessons?” said a friend who had been all
through it. “Well, when you go along
for your test they’ll make allowances if
you pretend you’re
nervous.” I had no need
to pretend when I drove
off with the policeman at
my side. Part of the test
entailed backing around a
corner in Sydney’s Wool-
loomooloo. Somehow I did
it, and, obeying the cop’s
instructions, I prepared to
drive ahead again, putting
my hand out to give the
signal. A gentleman with
a flooded carburettor
staggered forward, seized
my outstretched hand,
shook it and asked me for
a smoke. After I gave him
one he showed his appre-
ciation by saying to the
cop “If you’re testing this
bloke for a licence, take
him up that street ahead.
Worst corner in the world
up there. Give him rats.”
We drove on, the cop sit-
ting back like a sphinx,
and I giving hand-signals
at the slightest provoca-
tion. A little later, though, when
I struck the hazard of a woman
suddenly alighting from the wrong
side of a car just ahead, and was
feeling proud at having reached the clutch
and brake a split-second before the cop,
he dryly remarked: “Stopping was the
only thing to do there, and in the circum-
stances we’ll overlook the fact that you
didn’t put your hand out.” I got the
licence all right, but if I had seen the
room in which he wrote out the chit be-
fore instead of after the test I wouldn’t
have had a hope. The walls were

“Had Brani”: Those kids who swal-
lowed castor-oil without a murmur (B.
11/8/’4B) must have had their taste-buds
destroyed by modern scientific nutrition.
Science, incidentally, has lifted a lot of
our inhibitions. Nowadays parents ask
their children if their insides are function-
ing. That question was never asked in
“But, dammit, I always had my bath this Way in Indiah !”
my household ; in fact, the subject was
never mentioned, though our parents
were obviously concerned about it. The
difficulty was got over by giving every
member of the family a tablespoonful of
brimstone and treacle every morning. An
appetiser, my mother called it.
* * * *
“Kellick”.; Let me tow Vendetta one
stage further. After Ping Wo dropped
her at Fremantle (B. 11/8/’4B) her line
was taken by Islander, a fellow-refugee.
Islander lost her in the Bight during an
extra-dirty blow, and the tug Woonda
went out from Port Adelaide to give
assistance. Eventually Vendetta berthed
at the outer harbor. Port Adelaide,
much battered, as was Islander. I
lost track of them then until I saw
both up in the Palm Tree waters in 1943.

“South Coast”: Any more space for
Scandinavian “j’s”? When my Swedish
friend gave me her recipe for guava jelly
her final instruction was, “Then you put
in the sugar and boil it till it yells.”

“G. Iris”; Several candidates for muni-
cipal honors in our suburb were given
the opportunity of stating their respective
platforms in a three-minute speech. One
of the younger aspirants disclosed all the
attributes of a born politician. When he
had finished the chairman said, “That
was a very fine speech, Mr, Candidate,
but you have used only two minutes and
forty seconds of your time.” “Oh,” re-
plied the embryo politician, “I reserved
that twenty seconds to thank you for the
compliment.”
* * * *
“Mekowl”: A heretic has raised his
iconoclastic head in the bosom of our
family, which, ever since it was a family,
has made milk its most important article
of diet. Milk has been drunk in floods
in the belief that of all comestibles it is
the most beneficial to the human frame.
The heretic, a somewhat athletic youth
given to the running of quarter-, half-
mile and mile footraces, now refuses to
drink milk within 48 hours of a race, his
coach or trainer or somebody having in-
formed him that milk is mostly fat, and
that as fat takes longer to digest than
anything else there is a danger of un-
digested fat slowing down the milk-
drinker. We showed him the announce-
ment that Fanny Blankers-Koen, the
Dutch woman who cleaned up the
Olympic events, practically lived on milk,
but you can’t bluff heretics like that.
“Huh, wimmen! ” he commented.

“Becks”; The opening-up of the
Danube to navigation by deep-sea ship-
ping, now claimed by Russia as an Iron
Curtain monopoly, was due in large part
to the work of an Englishman, Sir Charles
Hartley, who was chief engineer of the
Danubian Commission from its incep-
tion in 1856 until 1907. When he began
his work the estuary of the river was a
vast marshy delta, intersected by shallow
channels nowhere more than Bft. or 9ft.
deep. One of his early reports told of
conditions:
The entrance was a wild open seaboard
strewn with wrecks, the hulls and masts of
which, sticking out of submerged sand-
banks, gave to mariners the only guide
where the deepest channel was to be
found.... The banks of the river near the
mouth were only indicated by clusters of
wretched hovels built on piles and by
narrow patches of sand skirted by tall
weeds Shipwrecks were of common
occurrence, and occasionally the number of
disasters was appalling. One dark night
•in 1855, during a terrific gale, 24 sailing-
ships and 60 lighters went ashore off the
mouth and upwards of 300 persons
perished.
When Hartley finished his job there was
a 24ft. channel through the delta to
Braila capable of carrying vessels up to
4000 tons, while 600-ton seagoing craft
could reach Turnu Severin, just below
Iron Gate, beyond which barge-traffic
took over, A fine town, Sulina, had
replaced the mud hovels, extensive
wharves had been built and buoys and
lighthouses made the channel safe for
ships of all nations. There were no
Russians on the Commission, though
doubtless Moscow can produce textbooks
to prove that the work was all done by
the grandfather of a Soviet commissar.

“Curate’s Egg”: Cauls As insurance
against drowning (B. 30/6/’48)? I was
once supercargo on an auxiliary ketch, be-
whose skipper and engineer there
was a wall of perpetual silence because
of a long-standing enmity. The rest of
the ship’s company were Torres Strait
Binghis. One drowsy afternoon, with no
land visible, the engineer asked me if I
could swim. To my nod he replied “I
can’t, but I’ll be all right. I was born
with a caul.” “What are you driving at?”
I demanded. He jerked his thumb in the
direction of the wheel, over which the
skipper gazed steadfastly ahead, and said
casually: “He’ll pile us up on the reef
any minute now.” Being under no vow
of silence I jumped up to warn the skipper
just as we plunged foursquare on a
“niggerhead,” on which we remained
poised for a sickening second with the
screw spinning wildly before a wave
lifted us off that crag to deposit us on
another. Thereafter it seemed ages before
we slithered down the other wall of the
reef to blue water again. The only man
who sat impassively through the ordeal
was the non-swimming engineer who had
been born with the caul.
* * * *
“A.L.A.” (Fiji): “Melbn” apparently
doesn’t like top-hats. Neither did a
friend of mine who was invited to a re-
ception held by a Chinese General at
Kunming, where, on such occasions, top-
hats were de rigueur. With a jaunty air
he prepared to go off in his old slouch,
when his wife spotted it. “Albert,” she
said in an ominously calm voice. “You
can’t wear that hat at the reception.”
Albert gave in, but refused to wear the
topper through the city, so Wang Fang,
the gatekeeper, was given the top-hat to
carry in a bandbox. At the gate of the
General’s residence Albert took out the
top-hat, deposited his old slouch in its
place, and as soon as the reception was
over retrieved his favorite headgear and
slammed in the topper. Then off went
Wang Fang once more bearing aloft the
box.
* * * *
“No Sirrah”: In a city building the
other day I passed an open door with a
sign indicating that it was a beauty-
parlor. There were four “clients” await-
ing attention, and Heaven knows they
needed it! They had two things wrong
with them—they were born with the
wrong faces, and they had forgotten how
to smile. They couldn’t do much about
the first fault, and perhaps no one dared
tell them about the second. The flapper
magazines are probably responsible for
the haunted and strained looks on the
face of women from 25-45 years old
who go scrabbling for the lost bloom of
youth. Why do they bother? A few
lines never yet hurt a good-looking face ;
one of the loveliest women I know is
between 60 and 70, and one of the most
charming girls I ever met had a nose on
her that would have put the Duke of
Wellington’s to shame.
NIGHT BETTING AT THE TROTS.
“The N.S.W. Cabinet decided last week to permit
betting at night-trotting meetings, with the result
that many country towns are already planning such
meetings.”
Another proof to show that they’re imbued
With something that indubitably can
Be termed benevolent solicitude
For the true welfare of the working man.
A brand-new race-club was their opening boon,
Designed to give the proletariat lots
Of wholesome pleasure. Now there’s coming
soon
Night betting at the Trots.
Our rulers know, better than most perhaps,
That overwork and insufficient play
Make Jack —with Bill and Tom and other
chaps—
Dull, bored and what the French call ennuye.
They aim, to brighten up his hours of ease,
Added allurements in selected spots,
Including among such amenities
; Night betting at the Trots.
’They hold we*re all of us entitled to —
You know the authors of the phrase, I guess—
Not only life and freedom as our due
But also the pursuit of happiness.
Just what may constitute felicity
Depends on individual tastes, but what’s
To indicate for some it may not be
Night betting at the Trots?
These Labor Governments arrive and go,
Abide their hour upon the stage and flit,
But here is something that McGirr and Co.
Have left us to recall them, you’ll admit
And many a book, 1 shouldn’t be surprised
(Though fewer punters, it may be surmised),
Will presently be toasting them in pots,
The sturdy democrats who’ve legalised
Night betting at the Trots.

t Includes net additions to reserve for unexpired risks.
The near-gilt-edge quality and equity
status of shares in a'n insurance office
like this N.Z. co. put them high in the
investment category, especially for long-
term holding. The policy of profits-allo-
cation ensures strong reserves and, at
increases in the amount distri-
buted as dividends and the issue of bonus
scrip. Mostly the div. is covered, more
or less, by returns from a wad of Govern-
ment and other sound securities, leaving
the underwriting surplus available to swell
investments and returns therefrom.
Certainly underwriting runs into bad
patches at times, but over-all the theory
of averages works well. Of recent years
official pursuit of cheap money, control
of rents and steep rise in taxation have
reduced the net return from investments.
Among other things, this means a wider
spacing of benefits. The vexed question
of nationalising the Dominion’s big in-
surance offices appears to have wisely
passed into the background since the
Government gave the State Insurance
Office a monopoly of workers’-compensa-
tion business, I
Shareholders in this highly-siiccessful
Auckland-controlled office, with world-
wide connections, have reaped some rich
harvests in the past. Of the £1,500,000
of paid capital, £1,200,000 has come from
reserves since 1912. Over the intervening
36 years divs. have averaged 11.2 p.c.,
and when the books last closed reserves,
including £2,517,500 for unexpired risks,
amounted to £5,405,635, or 360 p.c. of
paid capital. Also, last term’s net return
from investments (£227,324, after deduct-
ing taxation) alone exceeded the 12i 'p.c.
div. by £39,824.
Last term the co. further expanded its
connections, especially in the Asiatic and
island territories where it had to fold up
following the Jap invasion. The greater
spread of business, growth in inventories
and rising values, etc., sent net premium
income up by £1,227,546;

The loss rate, over which the manage-
ment has no control, shot up by £l2 p.c.,
and might get worse before it becomes
better. The pleasing feature is that the
bigger business was written at £5 16s.
p.c. less cost. The gross underwriting
surplus was £755,369 (up £16,731).
Allowing 40 p.c,, the amount usually cpn-
sidered adequate, for unexpired risks, the
net surplus was £264,351 (down £168,929).
Including the net return from investments
and £11,359 tossed from somewhere into
reserves, the year’s net result from all
sources was £503,034 (down £123,597),
or a juicy 33.5 p.c. on capital as against
47.1 p.c. for the previous term.
Since the co, presents its accounts in
N.Z. currency, last week’s alteration of
the exchange rate from £N.Z. 124 =
£SIOO to par, or approximately par, with
sterling will: (1) call for adjustment of
the book-value of some assets, for which
purpose the co. has ample reserves ; (2)
reduce the money-value of net earnings
in terms of N.Z. currency, though not
sufficiently to endanger the I2j p.c. div.;
and (3) make a 12£ p.c. div. worth 15i
p.c. in Australian currency at last week-
end’s buying rate of £AI24 18s. 9d. for
£N.Z.IOO.
On Sydney ’Change buyers offered 945.
6d. for the f.-p. pound shares after previ-
ous sales at 965. 6d. In Australian cur-
rency the higher figure gave a return of
2.5 p.c, on a 12i p.c. div. basis before
alteration of the exchange rate, or 3,2 p.c.
at the current rate of exchange. On the
same div. basis a 2.5 p.c. yield at the
current rate of exchange would make the
scrip worth 1245. 9d. in Australian cur-
rency, and a 3 p.c. yield, 103 s. 4d.
Obviously the market was anticipating
an early distribution of benefits, either by
capitalisation of reserves or a further lift
in the div.—last bonus-scrip issue was
£300,000, one-for-four, in 1930. The
cautious board, however, might now pre-
fer to wait until the outlook becomes
clearer before deciding to do either.
The solid protection for policyholders
and shareholders is in this form:

to investment in company shares (up
£547,387 last term), which augurs well for
the return from investments.

Though it hasn’t yet had a chance to
put on much fat, this 10-year-old is now
firmly on its feet and has given a good
account of itself. Certainly circum-
stances have been propitious: shortly
after production began in 1939 war broke
out, overseas competition, mainly from
Britain and Japan, was shut off, and de-
fence orders taxed plant to capacity.
Since war ended the story has been one
of an overflowing order-book, chief
bottlenecks being shortages of yarn and
suitable labor, and, of course, the im-
pediments of bureaucratic control.
In these circumstances, and with buy-
ing and selling prices controlled all along
the line, shareholders got into the pic-
ture with 8 p.c. in the second year, fol-
lowed by 9 p.c. and then a liberal 10 p.c.
for the half-dozen years to the close of
last accounts. They could then see the
whole of their capital intact and £12,082
besides. Profits, after providing for de-
preciation and taxation, haven’t varied
much either side of 12i p.c. on capital
over the last six years.
' With prices much higher than they
used to be, and likely to go higher still
if the subsidy on cotton is withdrawn,
need to carry extra stock, especially of
imported yarns, and more business now
being done on ordinary trade terms in-
stead of a mainly cash-on-delivery basis
as formerly, more working capital can
now be employed in the business. So
shareholders are to be asked on Septem-
ber 8 to raise nominal capital to £500,000
by the creation of '400,000 new £1 shares,
of which 20,250 are to be offered to
those on the register (date to be an-
nounced), one for four, at par. When all
the money on the new issue is in paid
capital will be £101,500, on which a 10
p.c. div. will call for only £l3 more
profit than was claimed last term.
The outlook for Australia’s; infant cot-
ton-textile industry, which can meet only
about one-third of local market require-
ments, is one of further expansion, pro-
vided wage and other costs over which
management has no control don’t get out
of hand. Later on competition can be
expected to get more of an edge on it;
but the co. has an alert management, and
its factory, of modern layout, is
equipped with automatic , looms, which
ought to mean much so far as costs and
competition are concerned.

the last couple of years. At the higher
figure the net price, ex rights', is approxi-
mately 395.;, giving a return of 5,1 p.c. on
a 10 p.c. div. basis, or 4.1 p.c. should
the rate drop to 8 pc.
Hastings Deering (Sydney)
Interest in the Hastings Deering group
of companies has been kindled by a par
issue of 300,000 £1 ords. which opened
late in July without mention of a closing-
date for applications. The issue breaks
with precedent to the extent that ordinary
capital in this organisation is being offered
to the general public for the first time;
but all the new scrip will be held in the
building co., which has hitherto had a
pretty circumscribed right to share in the
group earnings, though some extension is
now contemplated.
Chairman of all the member cos. is
Harold Hastings Deering, and in the
small but important Hastings Deering
Pty. he holds most of the paid capital
(£23,803 out of £26,007 last April), The
oldest member of the team, this pro-
prietary seems to be purely a holding con-
cern since it transferred its Ford distri-
buting rights to Hastings Deering Ser-
vice, Ltd., in 1940.
By means of his interest in the pro-
prietary, Mr. Deering owns nearly all the
ords. in Hastings Deering Service, the
bulk of whose capital has been put up
by the general public in preference scrip.
In its turn. Service holds most of the
present capital of Hastings Deering Build-
ing, Ltd., which is now inviting public
support. No Hastings Deering scrip of
any kind is officially listed on ’Change.
Hastings Deering Service, Ltd.
Besides distributing Ford cars and
trucks within the Sydney metropolitan
area, Service is agent for Exide batteries
and other lines, provides for the parking
and servicing of vehicles, and recently set
up a bodybuilding plant to fit out im-
ported chassis. Service is the tenant of
all the freeholds owned by Building, but
details of the leases aren’t fully known.
Service’s £25,000 ordinary capital
(owned mostly by the proprietary) is sup-
plemented by 90,000 first and 135,000
second £1 prefs., both 7 p.c. cumulative.
Net profits in the co.’s first five years

terms. A second large increase in bank
overdraft has been necessary to meet
bigger stocks, plant, hire-purchase and
other debts:

Still more vehicles are likely to be avail-
able this term, with Canadian models
remaining scarce for lack of dollars. The
English Ford co. —it claims to be that
country’s largest car-maker and -exporter
—is turning out Anglias and Prefects at
twice last year’s pace since it swung into
mass-production methods.

Of the four main properties owned (sub-
ject to mortgage), the oldest is the
William-street head office and showroom
bought in 1936. Two years later a site
just off William-street was acquired to
erect a modern building which, on com-
pletion, was leased to Service for £2OOO
a year. A Camperdown freehold, pur-
chased last term, has been turned into a
bodybuilding shop.
The fourth position at Lidcombe (west
of Sydney) comprises eight acres bought
in 1946 to build a large parking- and
service-station. It is expected to be half-
completed in October and ready for
partial occupancy by Service. Expendi-
ture to last June was mainly financed by
£50,835 extra bank overdraft;

Of the present capital, 99,692 ords. and
10,000 prefs. belong to Service. The
new issue, if fully subscribed, will raise
Building’s capital to £420,000 and the
combined figure for Service and Build-
ing to £670,000, backed by £12,387 re-
serves.
Part of the issue will be used by Build-
ing to subscribe to a new concern, Hast-
ings Deering Trading Pty., with authorised
capital of £lOO,OOO. This co. “will
acquire Ford spare-parts” from Service,
then trade in spares and accessories, and
“develop other activities in which it is
believed there is an expanding market”
What proportion of Service’s present busi-
ness will be involved in the transfer isn’t
Clear.
Most of the new capital, however, is
needed for the Lidcombe building, for
which the prospectus offers no estimate
of the final cost, nor of the revenue to
be expected (“a satisfactory rental” is
said to have been arranged with Service).
In the three years for which figures are
available. Building’s net profits have
averaged a shade under 6 p.c. on capital.
Its new interest in the spare-parts co. may
enable future earnings to be somewhat
more elastic, but any important windfalls
from Ford vehicle sales are still destined
apparently to fall into the lap of the Ser-
vice ords.
Whether ’Change listing will be sought
for the new shares isn’t mentioned in the
prospectus.


If you are prospering in business you may
feel that your future years are secure.
Have you ever stopped to think that your
business might fall away and your final years
be spent working instead of in leisure?
While you are young or in middle age, you
can plan to spend your retirement at your ease.
That’s what we mean by being CAREFREE.
Being carefree in old age is the rich reward
for financial planning in time.
Any A.M.P. Officer or Representative will be
pleased to talk the question over with you and
explain how provision for your retirement may be
planned.

Emperor Mines, Ltd. (Fiji)
Shareholders in this holding
co. will be asked on August 27
to sanction a further return of
2s. a share (£191,400), reducing
paid capital to £378,600 in f.-p.
4s. shares. Originally paid capi-
tal was £950,000, of which
£142,500 (Is. 6d. a share) and
£237,500 (2s. 6d. a share) were
returned early in 1944 and 1946
respectively. When the present
proposed 2s. a share is paid the
co. will have handed share-
holders £571,400 in return of
capital and £570,000 in divi-
dends, a total of £1,141,000, or
£191,400 more than original paid
capital. At end June, 1947, the
co.’s principal asset was 200,000
2s, 6d. shares in Emperor Gold
Mining Co., Ltd., the operating
co., valued in the books at
£517,946. It also held 62,000 f.-p.
£1 shares in Tavua Power Pty.,
and £7065 cash, etc. The power
co. supplies current, compressed-
air and water to the Emperor
and Loloma mines, which are
now into the sulphides. Ore
from both mines is treated on
joint account at the Emperor
mill, to which Loloma’si roaster
and some other equipment were
transferred.
The operating co., whose mine
is on the Tavua field, Fiji, has a
paid capital of £25,000. Though
profits have been earned, no
dividend has been paid by either
the operating or holding co.
since 1941. The declared reason
is the present high rate of Aus-
tralian income tax. For the year
to end June, 1947, the operating
co. treated 138,760 tons ore,
averaging 8.73dwt,, for a profit
of £93,602 (up £5649). The re-
covery was 89.5 p.c. When the
books closed it had accumu-
lated £745,149-worth of bullion,
cash and Fiji Government
securities, so it will have no
difficulty in passing on to the
holding co. enough to meet the
proposed repayment of capital.
Ore reserves at end June, 1947,
were put at 875,000 tons positive
and 150,000 tons probable, both
averaging 7.Bdwt. gold.
The market prices the holding
co.’s 65.-paid shares at 17s. 9d.
Outstanding feature of Gt.
Boulder’s developmental work
last year was the intersection of
a new gold-carrying formation
at the 3100 ft. level of Edward’s
Shaft. A total length of 150 ft.
of ore, averaging B.sdwt. over a
width of 58 inches, has been
proved to date. Diamond dril-
ling disclosed several extensions
of known lodes and two others.
Since war ended there has been
a slight but persistent increase
in the grade of ore treated.
There has also been a rise in
overall working costs, which last
year averaged 41s. 5.67 d. as
against 395. 9.16 d. the year be-
fore and 395. 5.27 d. the year be-
fore that. Ore reserves at De-
cember 31 last were estimated at
2,386,867 tons of s.3dwt. grade, a
decrease of 6194 tons compared
with the previous year’s figures.

THE first Pyramid of King Cheops is nearly 6,000
years old. It has withstood Time's ravages because
(1) although surrounded by sand if is built on a
foundation of solid rock; (2) unlike any other edifice
there is no roof to cave in or walls to crumble;
(3) the greater the tendency to fall or follow the
natural fall of gravity, the firmer the structure
presses on its foundations.
Ronaldson-Tippett Engines, (Diesel, Petrol, Petrol-
Kero.), follow a similarly sound structural theory.
Their sterling performance is founded first on recog-
nized engineering principles, then on correct design
and finally on honest materials and effort, faithfully
applied.

Mt. Eba on Pitt-street
A meeting of the Associated
Stock Exchanges of Australia
decided the other day to con-
tinue the ban on forward deal-
ings in scrip, the fact being re-
ported in one daily as “Bear
ban to stay.” The ban is unin-
tentionally kind to Pitt-street
“miners” dealing in Mt. Eba
Gold shares at 14s. and up—
though, of course, before there
can be a “bear” there must also
be a “bull.” However, with
goldmining stocks, statistics will
show that the bears win the
tussle in by far the greater num-
ber of cases if they continue
their attacks long enough.
The puffed-up Stock Ex-
change price of 14s. a share for
Mt. Eba scrip, incidentally,
establishes a basis for any private
dealing that might take place
outside the Stock Exchange.
Pitt-street “miners” have been
operating in Mt. Eba shares for
over six months; whether
there is ever found to be
payable quantities of gold
in that thar mine or not,
the Pitt - street practitioners,
large and small, will see money
made and lost —in share deal-
ings. Some people who have
bought shares in Mt. Eba
frankly admit that they do not
care whether there are profitable
mining operations ahead of the
co. or not; they are in the
shares “for the ride,” feeling
confident that other Pitt-street
“miners” will assist in pushing
the market up to a point where
they will be able to unload at
a profit and let some more
stouthearted (or less experi-
enced) punter carry on from
there.
For, regardless of whatever
real mining activity is going
on at the mine (north of
Kanowna, W.A.), or what-
ever success the management
achieves, there is a lot of
Stock Exchange activity in the
shares. And, to carry out the
actual mining programme, in-
cluding expenditure in connec-
tion with the property, the com-
pany itself has been issuing more
scrip; latest proposal is to
double capital by the issue of
200,000 new 2s. 6d. shares in the
ratio of one for one. Of
course, as that will represent no
more than £2-5,000 of actual
capital in the hands of the co.,
it may be only a forerunner to
other issues if it is decided to
work the property with exten-
sive plant.
These new issues may appear
attractive to Pitt-street miners,
especially if the price of the
new scrip can be puffed up to
the level of the old. But to the
mining investor and the manage-
ment they represent an increase
in the number of shares over
which future dividends (if any)
will have to be spread. As the
Mt. pba mine is still in the de-
velopment stage, it is hard in-
deed at this juncture to forecast
(a) the full extent and value of
the ore available, ( b ) the size
and nature of the plant that will
be needed, or (c) the actual re-
covery of gold that will be
achieved in milling operations.
Assay values are rarely the same
as recovery values'. Costs, too,
have yet to be ascertained —the
prospectus estimate in this
respect (30s. a ton) seemed far
too low for moderate tonnages.
Mt. Eba management has
already issued 200,000 2s. 6d.
shares. These the Pitt-street
optimists have puffed up to 14s.
each in the market, giving the
mine a Pitt-street valuation of
£140,000. If capital is doubled
speculators should ponder over
the implications of any hopes
they might nurture about mar-
ket movements for the new
issue; if they hope to see the
new scrip rise to the price of the
old, then they look for a total
market valuation of £280,000.
They should compare any
such hypothetical valuation with
actual dividends paid up to the
middle of 1948 by several
well-known Westralian gold-
mines, as shown by the Mel-
bourne “Stock Exchange
Record” —Boulder Perseverance,
£153,313 (sterling); Ora Banda
Amalgamated, £95,000 (Aust.);
Triton, £264,000 (Aust.);
Phoenix, £95,000 (Aust.); Edna
May, £87,062 (Aust.), including
capital-returns. And, of course,
for every one of these cos.
which reached the div.-paying
stage, many fizzled out long be-
fore. That’s the way it goes
with goldmines.
£A, £N.Z. and £Stg.
The decision of New Zealand
to bring its exchange rate to
parity with that of Great Britain
puts a lower price on gold in
the Dominion. To many this
will seem a fantastic anomaly
in a world in which the
monetary and costs inflation of
the war and post-war periods
are still tending to put a higher
paper-money price on almost
everything else. The Maoriland
price of gold will be around
£N.Z.B 12s. an ounce, the same
as in Britain, compared with
£lO 15s. in the Commonwealth
(subject to charges).
Today the free gold markets
of the world indicate that even
the dollar has depreciated in
terms of gold. Wherever gold is
bargained for, few traders would
part with an ounce of the yellow
metal in exchange for 35 paper
dollars. Yet that is the basis on
which the United States
Treasury is still buying gold.
The fact that it has been able
to add to its stocks on this basis
of purchase is probably due
more than anything else to the
fact that countries with gold to
sell are in urgent and immediate
need of goods which only the
United States is able to provide.
“ Mother , Jim'll marry me if We can live here without
paying board. Whacko!”
Sterling remains a key to
Empire currencies. Through
sterling a relationship with the
dollar-exchange rate is estab-
lished, and hence the price of
gold. Sterling is overvalued in
terms of dollars, and thus over-
valued still more in terms of
gold. In New York the pound
sterling may sometimes *be
bought at as low as $2.50 to the
£, against the official rate of
$4.02. The blackmarket figure,
however, is probably a good deal
below a fair rate for sterling.
Some people think that Britain
should have effected an exchange
adjustment with the 'U.S.A. at,
say, $3 to the £, with the sterling
price of gold rising as one result,
and Dominion currencies com-
ing to par with sterling as an-
other, the price of dollars and
gold in the Dominions remain-
ing practically unchanged.
This would have brought
about a fall in the cost of ster-
ling imports to Australia and
Maoriland, a fall in receipts by
those Dominions for products
sold to Britain and no change
in the cost of dollar-area goods
(except to Britain).
Britain probably feels that the
time isn’t yet ripe to devalue
sterling. With so much external
indebtedness she perhaps hopes
to extinguish as much of it as
possible at a flattering rate to
sterling so long as a sellers’
market exists for British goods.
Exports need no special stimu-
lation —at the moment. And if
the battle of internal costs can
be fought and won before
currency devaluation takes
place, so much the better.
Australian costs today appear
to be low by many correspond-
ing expenses in • the United
States and Britain, but until
output per man per hour can
be increased in this country it
would be foolish to raise the
value of our pound in relation
to the dollar. A sharp fall in
export prices, with import costs
still high and production ex-
penses still rising, might quickly
prove any currency-apprecia-
tion move to have been abortive.
The New Zealand move seems
to have been a hasty, short-
sighted attempt to reduce living
costs without fully considering
long-term consequences. As it
was done without consulting
Britain, it seems to have been a
singularly precipitate and
domestically political action.
The N.Z. Butler Contract
New Zealand’s new butter-
and-cheese deal with John Bull is
likely to net the Dominion at
least an extra £6 million in the
first year of the seven-year-
contract, and should hold the
total dairy cheque well above
£4O million, even if production
slips back from the high level
reached last season. The
1948-49 price for butter is 2355.
stg. .per cwt, a rise of 305., and
there’s a corresponding increase
on cheese, which was 118 s. last
season. Prices will be subject
to annual review and variation
up to 1\ p.c. either way on pay-
ments for the previous season.
Over the 10 years of bulk
selling to Britain prices for M.L.
butter and cheese have been:

The new agreement is really a
five-year extension of that ham-
mered in 1944 for four years,
but since given two years’ addi-
tional life. M.L. regards the
price of 2355. as slightly less
than necessary to offset the ad-
vance in British export prices.
Farmers are speculating how
much of the gain the Govern-
ment will pass on to them in the
guaranteed price for their pro-
duce. Last season they were
handed out the equivalent of
1795. sterling of the 2055. paid
by Britain, and the remaining
265. went into the dairy in-
dustry’s pool funds, which have
been snowballing well into eight
figures. Since the return of the
£N.Z. to sterling parity farmers
have been speculating still more.
N.Z. has topped off a bumper
1947-48 export season with a
record cheque of £35 million for
wool. Not much by Australian
standards, but for Maoriland it’s
a rise of 40 p.c., and nearly
treble average pre-war wool ex-
portsi of £l2 million. N.Z. ship-
ments were only a quarter of
Australia’s, but in foodstuffs
New Zealand left the Common-
wealth standing. Here are 1947
export figures:
New Aus-
Zealand, tralia,
Tons. Tons.
Meat 347,000 165,000
Butter 127,000 60,000
Cheese 82,000 24,000
Wool 167,000 640,000
Average exports per
head £72 £42
Price-rises for butter, cheese
and meat under bulk contracts
lately fixed up with Britain
should add several millions to
N.Z, export income in the 1948-
49 season. The total for the year
ended March was £l4O millions,
beating the record of a year
earlier by £32,689,000. There’s
only one snag; the rise in im-
port prices has been keeping
slightly ahead of exports and
swallowing up the new wealth.

From Herbert Holman
Crime—
The Commonwealth visitor
who knew Great Britain before
the war is not likely, on return,
to notice any obvious increase jn
lawlessness. Shortages, controls
and the nagging difficulties of
everyday life may have brought
about a slight deterioration in
moral standards. But in general
the bulk of the people believe
that the edge to their self-dis-
dained practice is kept keen only
by the pressure of affairs: as
conditions improve so do they
hope to revert to their true
selves.
Taking this into account, a
true perspective is essential when
the so-called post-war “crime
wave” is considered. From the
Prison Commissioner’s report
for 1947 two significant facts
emerge: British prisons are in-
adequate and overcrowded;
and, with serious crime, the ad-
vantage at present is with the
criminal. The report mentions
a “reversion to conditions which
have not been seen for some 40
years,” and forecasts that the
peak has not yet been reached.
The daily average prison
population has increased from
15,789 in 1946 to 17,101 in
1947. In May of this year it
was 19,700, and is expected to
rise to more than 20,000 in the
future.
The percentage of those
found guilty of indictable
offences who were sentenced to
imprisonment, penal servitude or
Borstal detention rose substan-
tially between 1944 and 1946:
imprisonment from 15.8 p.c. to
17.6 “p.c., penal servitude from
.568 p.c. to 1.100 p.c. and
Borstal detention from 1.072 p.c.
to 1.655 p.c. Women prisoners
are fewer, the figures showing a
steady decline. After a steep
rise in the number of juvenile
delinquents in 1944-45 there was
an equivalent fall in 1946.
The report stresses the high
proportion of men serving long
sentences. This is the substance
of the problem. Offences
against the person, forgery, rob-
bery with violence and burglary
have increased. The habitual
criminal finds the prospect alto-
gether too tempting and the get-
away too easy. The prisons may
be full, but there are still many
criminals who have not yet
been brought to book.
—and Punishment
The Criminal Justice Bill,
which received the Royal Assent
at the end of July, was first in-
troduced 10 years ago after a
seven-year investigation into
the ways of persistent offenders.
A strange tale of misdirected
emotion, vacillation and ex-
penditure of talk has come to
an end with the Government’s
decision to let the Bill go through
without the clause suspending
the death penalty. The Socialists
knew that their clash with the
House of Lords was also a clash
with public opinion.
Under the new penal code
lawbreakers) are broadly divided
into three classes.
The first is made up of those
—mainly young offenders —who
tend to drift into crime. Here
reformation is the underlying
principle. Offenders are not to
be committed to the bad con-
tacts and contamination of
prison life. Emphasis is on the
system of probation, with the
proviso that every conviction
must be recorded, so that the
offender doesn’t go away with
the feeling that he'has been “let
off.” If probation fails he will
not be sent to prison, either be-
fore or after trial, but to a re-
mand centre, where his charac-
ter can be observed. A range of
other institutions, with different
kinds of discipline, is also to be
available. Of these, the “attend-
ance centre” was introduced in
a later stage of the Bill. Here
the offender will suffer no more
than the old corrective of being
“kept in” when he might other-
wise have been playing games
or going to the cinema.
In the second class are those
who have already committed
themselves to acts of crime but
who are not past mending their
ways. Here emphasis is on de-
terrence. Corporal punishment,
penal servitude and hard labor
are considered to be out of date.
The intended deterrent is depri-
vation of liberty and nothing
else. The element of reforma-
tion will depend upon hard
work, directed at preparing the
convict for life outside.
With the third category, the
“old lags,” the code realistically
admits that little can be done
about them, and expresses the
hope that they will gradually
dwindle in number. After at
least four serious offences the
hardened criminal is to be
locked away for from five to 10
years, with no other object than
to protect society from his mis-
deeds. But, by incontestably
making good, even he is not
denied the opportunity of an
early release.
Too Few Police
The most effective counter to
crime is a police force that is
on top of its job. The fact that
a criminal knows he will sooner
or later be caught is a surer de-
terrent than an estimation of the
kind of sentence he might re-
ceive if he is convicted.
In London alone the police
are 5000 below strength. That
the life is unattractive is shown
by the large numbers who have
joined since the war and re-
signed during the first year. The
chief complaints are that the
pay is poor, promotion slow
and, because of improved
methods of detection, the rou-
tine dull. That security which
the Force offered in the ’3os
and before can now be obtained
in other work —and without
shifts, danger or discipline. The
greatest bar to recruitment is un-
doubtedly the lack of housing.
Some police - officers are
separated from their families by
as much as 100 miles. Local
authorities will give no priority.
The Lord Chancellor has
promised that a committee of in-
quiry into housing will be set up,
but not until 1949.
There is no suggestion that the
police are less efficient. The
average number of arrests for
indictable crime for each police-
man has increased. Highly-
organised “rackets” happily are
unheard of.
Meanwhile, with 800-900
metropolitan police-officers due
for retirement between 1949 and
1951 after 30 years’ service, im-
mediate and determined action
by the Government would seem
to be imperative.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Society of Artists.
At the Society of Artists Ex-
hibition at the Education Depart-
ment Gallery, Sydney, there are
slums by Sali Herman, Margaret
Olley, George Lawrence and
others ; flowerpieces—chiefly by
Dorothy Thornhill nudes,
oddities and a variety of land-
scapes. ,
William Dobell is represented
by a landscape which is small,
delicate and, except for the fact
that it was painted by Dobell
and resembles the work of early
Australian landscapists, unim-
portant. His “Diane and the
Goldfish,” however, is a
charming picture of a child
in a pram on a verandah
with the fish flashing red and
gold through green water near
her. The child is idealised in
white, a white light cuts across
the picture and past a door, and
the delicate gaiety of the paint-
ing is reflected in dots of color
in a flowering tree behind the
pram. Outside there is a glimpse
of the countryside—a building,
brown earth and a horse-and-
sulky—lightly sketched. The
picture, belongs to the Oliviers.
Another kind of Australian
landscape arid character is pic-
tured in Russell Drysdale’s
“Cricketers” —lean and lonely
players poised in a wasteland
behind a grim country pub.
Drysdale can achieve waste and
emptiness, but overemphasis and
impossible skies rob his land-
scapes of full dramatic impact,
as a liking for caricature de-
humanises his human figures.
Lloyd Rees’s “Sunset on the
Omega Hills” is like a piece of
carefully painted china; John
D. Moore’s “Australian Land-
scape” is patterned, slightly
grim; Charles Lloyd Jones’s;
“Afternoon” has pleasant, green,
parklike lawns, sunlight, discreet
color, shadows and a poor sky;
and Paul Haefliger’s “Near
Bathurst” is smudgy and unreal.
John Eldershaw’s pair of
watercolor landscapes are rather
faint and flat —well below his
highest standard. Kenneth Mac-
Queen’s “Rough Seas” (water-
color) pictures sea of an impos-
sibly stylised roughness; Donald
Friend has a feebly grotesque
piece of pictorial humor,
“Aimez-moi, Matelot,” and
some blasted granite, and Maud
Sherwood has a picturesque
watercolor, “Kairouan.”
Arthur Murch has one of his
Madonna - and - child pictures,
with grace and sensitive light in
it, and a large, richer composi-
tion, “The Adoration.” Freda
Robertshaw’s “Girl and Child,”
with its mixture of fantasy and
meticulous detail, is curiously
reminiscent of Pre-Raphaelite
paintings. Norman Carter’s por-
trait of an old lady and Joshua
Smith’s portrait of Professor
Harvey Sutton are the best ex-
amples of the art of portraiture.
Both are sound, competent pieces
of work, although the first is too
dark, and the second has unfor-
tunate highlights of color in the
blue-shirt collar and the crimson
edge of gown.
J. Carrington Smith’s “Girl in
a Green Tunic” is interesting and
technically commendable, but
rather disconcerting—the girl is
almost forbiddingly mature.
Jean Appleton’s “Nude” is large,
rich and rather hazy; Charles
Meere’s “Redhead” is a small
nude with some problems of
drawing evaded, but with a vital
warmth. Other paintings of in-
terest are D. Orban’s “South
Coast Timber Country” and
“French’s Forest,” George Law-
rence’s “The Village Church,”
Frank McNamara’s “The Float-
ing Dock, Newcastle,” and John
Rowell’s “Grass-tree Forest.”
Grand Opera.
“Madam Butterfly” followed
“Aida” at Melbourne His
Majesty’s, and if the Taits have
more operatic fare as good as
this attempt of Puccini’s to
create the spirit of Japan, or
any more ingratiating prima
donnas than Rina Malatrasi, the
current season should be emin-
ently successful.
Even if Rina Malatrasi
lacked a voice capable of
expressing all the nuances of
Puccini’s music, which she
doesn’t, she would make a first-
rate performer in straight drama.
The same could be said of
Leo Piccioli as Sharpless and
Aldo Ferracuti as that uncon-
scionable scoundrel Pinkerton.
In fact, these two gentlemen,
drinking weeskies in Cho-Cho
San’s garden and discussing
Pinkerton’s proposed desertion
of his Japanese inamorata, were
so true to life that they made
one momentarily forget Puccini’s
music, minus which the play
might have been a modern
drama on the present Army of
Occupation.
Other Pinkertons and Sharp-
lesses have been just Italian
baritones and tenors, but these
two weren’t, and the Butterfly
of Miss Malatrasi was an
extraordinarily relaxed and
appealing little thing, as grace-
ful as the mime in “Les Enfants
du Paradis.” It was unfortunate
that they had to express their
emotions in a garden as Japanese
as the specimen in the Fitzroy
Gardens, and winking with large
emerald fireflies hitherto un-
known to science. ■ But that’s
the sort of thing that happens in
grand opera.
Less fault could be found with
the interior of Butterfly’s house,
where the gradual working-out
of the matrimonial drama to its
tragic conclusion proceeded in
perfect agreement with the de-
velopment of Puccini’s sweet,
hypnotic music, with its Japan-
ese themes and its Star-Spangled
Banner motive —that the worm-
like Pinkerton should be ac-
corded that patriotic ditty should
be a subject for a diplomatic
protest. Mrs. Pinkerton made
her brief and equivocal appear-
ance in the person of Errol
Howard.
“Tosca”
One has to see opera in re-
hearsal to realise how much de-
pends on the conductor. - If the
soprano, anxiously followed by
the stage producer, takes one
step too few or too many or the
baritone, with one eye on the
carpenter who is shoving the
Farnese Palace into position,
smites his chest a split-second be-
fore the chord with which the
composer has illustrated his
action, the whole thing becomes
ridiculous and banal. When this
happens in rehearsal conductor
Franco Ghione explodes like a
bomb. His anguish, which lasts
for anything up to 10 minutes,
is more awe-inspiring and poig-
nant than La Tosca’s when she
is the helpless witness of
Scarpia’s persuasive methods
with her lover.
From the three vindictive
chords which open the proceed-
ings to the final leap of the
Fortunati from the ramparts of
the San’ Antonio prison, every-
thing in “Tosca” seemed to be
well done. Puccini was lucky or
intelligent in his choice of
librettos. “Butterfly” was based
on an excellent stage play, and
Sardou can be thanked for the
effectiveness of “Tosca’s” stage-
craft. It came out in the produc-
tion which would have been ex-
citing drama even without the
music, and the music is mainly
dramatic recitative until the last
act, when Cavaradossi becomes
beautifully melodious on the eve
of his execution.
As Chief of the Rome Ges-
tapo, short, dark Mario Basiola
dominated the evening with the
subdued intensity of his dia-
bolical intentions. Mercedes
Fortunati gave passion and the
richest of sopranos to La Tosca.
Alvino Misciano, as the painter,
was handsome and vocally
superb, and Badioli gave the
sacristan a fine baritone voice
and genuine comedic talent.
Joseph Post and
Haydn Beck.
Joseph Post set the standard
of playing for his Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra programme at
Sydney Town Hall on Friday
night with a sparkling perform-
ance of Elgar’s scholarly
arrangement of Handel’s Over-
ture in D Minor to one of the
Chandos Anthems. He followed
with a performance of Mozart’s
Symphony No, 39 in E Flat
Major which emphasised its in-
herent song-like character, from
the triple-time of the first
melody in the Adagio-Allegro to
the rushing gaiety of the strings
in the final Allegro against
which the well-handled wood-
wind choir lent sobering voices.
Debussy’s triptych, “La Mer,”
which followed, is bloodless as
“programme” music. It would
be a perfect soporific had the
composer been considerate
enough to eliminate the annoy-
ing cymbals.
Haydn Beck was an alert and
competent soloist in the Con-
certo No. 3 in B Minor of Saint-
Saens, his) most polished work
being done in the Andantino —
here the broad sweep of the
Sicilian dance measure suited
Mr. Beck’s easy, flowing style.
The various events leading up to
Till Eulenspiegel’s tryst with the
hangman rounded off a well-
balanced programme.
At his Sydney Con. recital
Robert Livingstone used a bari-
tone generally of good timbre —
even throughout a range that
needs to be extended down-
ward —produced without effort
and of a pleasing resonance.
With his legato style his voice
is eminently suited to Handel
oratorio, and he uses the half-
voice with judgment. Too often,
however, there is a lack of fire
in his singing—his voice requires
dramatic inflection to escape
color-monotony. A group of
Wolf lieder didn’t suit him —
their melodic content was
microscopic and their range of
scale and emotion too restricted.
A Ponchielli aria was to his
obvious liking. Of some Eng-
lish ballads a Michael Head
number and “Invictus” were the
most acceptable.

Women’s Letters
From Sydney
Princess Margaret had her eighteenth
birthday at the week-end. This marked
her Royal coming-of-age, and entitled her
to a flat of her own in Buckingham
Palace, where she will have two tele-
phones (think of that, Sydney would-be
subscribers!), and probably another flat
at Windsor Castle. She is reported to
love pretty clothes, and to go for the
latest styles in a big way. The birthday
was celebrated with a party at Balmoral
Castle, one of the guests being the 22-
year-old Marquis of Blandford. Well,
whatever the Princess’s presents and
birthday greetings, she will receive no
warmer wish for her happiness than that
which goes to her from Australia.
From nine o’clock last Friday night to
one o’clock on Saturday morning, Eliza-
beth Northcott and 200 of her friends
danced at Government House. Party was
given by the Governor and Mrs. North-
cott for their daughter, but they them-
selves made the briefest of appearances,
leaving Elizabeth to do the honors. Spring
flowers in all their fresh glory decorated
the reception-rooms.
Anthony Hordern’s Spring Fashion
Parades which commenced last Monday
afternoon and will continue till. the end
of the week had interesting and spirited
prologue. This was a dialogue carried on
in animated fashion between “Mr. and
Mrs. Anthony Hordern,” the founder of
the Brickfield Hill firm and his wife.
The two wore the fashions of the period
—126 years ago, and as a curtain-raiser
to the very newest in 1948 styles the
dialogue was a success.
Sydney women last week queued up
either for fashion-parades or for pressure-
cooker demonstrations. Like the clothes,
the cookers were of varied nationalities,
but the made-in-Australia mark was more
frequently emphasised on them. Judging
by the groups watching the demonstra-
tors toss the ingredients for a meat-and-
three-or-more-vegetables dinner into one
of these magic pots, and serving up a
piping-hot meal in about 15 or 20 minutes
is just too much for the businesswoman.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite in a hypno-
tised way dug into her bag for the money
with one hand, and clutched a cooker
with the other. Since when she’s been
invited out to dinner every night.
The fashion-parades are really some-
thing to make the eyelashes flutter. The
French and American frocks and hats
have grace, charm and so much feminine
allure that, dressed in them, a pantomime
dame might pass for a fairy doll. The
onlooker at the big stores and at the
small intimate French salon displays
almost swoons with delight. There’s only
one thing wrong with the darn things—
that’s the price.
There is always something very touch-
ing about the Junior Red Cross Exhibi-
tion. It is not only that it shows the
patience and good nature of the small
Australian girls and boys who labor for
others under its symbol of mercy, but
the spirit of friendship for the children
of the world it inspires must stir the heart
of grown-up visitors. Perhaps these
children, little Red Cross'ers all over the
globe, may spring-clean the nations of
their anger and suspicions.
Last Wednesday the Town Hall was
packed as tight as an Old Vic. audience.
There were two sessions, morning and
afternoon, and the J.R.C. pageant, of
# folk dances and songs, met with terrific
applause from the youngsters in the hall;
and finally when the small citizens of
Mexico and China, Czechoslovakia,
Switzerland, Maoriland and other parts
of the earth had retired to the sidelines,
and the two human Red Crosses on the
platform seats had finished their singing,
the Blue Bird of Happiness girdled
the world and its little inhabitants with
the gold riband of friendship, the audi-
ence was wide-eyed with approval. Mrs.
Northcott, the Governor’s wife, was pre-
sent at the morning session. Mayoress
Bartley presided in the afternoon, and
held the usual tea-drinking in her rooms
for office-bearers and colnmittee mem-
bers.
Fashionable Sydney took its purse
along to Leonard Long’s show in the
Grosvenor Galleries last week, and many
of the pictures were sold before the open-
ing speech was made. Reverend Dr.‘
Tuomey sounded almost guilty of the
sin of pride when extolling the artist,
who, as a young boy, had been one of
his parishioners. He was an early buyer,
too, and chose a lovely piece of captured
sunlight. The Davis lady is the richer
for a canvas of high wave and tempestu-
ous foam. The National Gallery will be
the blither for “The Gum.” R.A.S.
president Erik Langker was at this show ;
so were Mrs. Neil Hutton and Mrs. H.
R. Dew, with two pretty daughters,
Barbara and Libby, both university
students.
The Ballet Club had a big day last
Thursday. The members farewelled Ruth
Burney, who has been in Australia and
Maoriland examining for the British
Ballet Organisation. Ruth was quite
overcome by the flowers, the sweets and
many other gifts presented to her with fair
words from the ballet teachers present.
She returned her thanks in clear-cut tones,
and then in turn presented Vera Lacey,
the president of the club, with the special
crest reserved for examiners only. On it
in relief are four ballet figures poised
in the dance. Underneath is inscribed the
name “Louise Kay.” The affair, which
wasn’t over till almost three o’clock,
ended with the singing of “Auld Lang
Syne,” clasped hands and all. The
lunch-hour talk by Nora Kelly was on
Sheridan, appropriate enough as many
of the lunchers were going on to “The
School.”
Sue Playfair, of this Norton Trevaire
photograph, is, with Jennifer Chapman,
looking after the publicity for the Black-
and-White Ball, which will be held at the
Trocadero on October 5. The ball is in
aid of the Sydney Industrial Blind In-
stitution, and for this as well as for the
Day Nurseries Sue is an active worker.
Confetti was sprinkled over, the annals
of Government House last week when
Captain J. F. Martin (private secretary
to the Governor, Lieut.-General North-
cott) squired daughter June to her matri-
monial tryst with Lieutenant Phillip Gre-
ville. The ceremony was in St. Vincent’s,
Ashfield, and the reception was at Amory.
Bridegroom is the eldest son of Lieut.-
Colonel and Mrs. S. J. Greville, of Bondi.
Elizabeth Northcott, daughter of the
Governor, was among the wedding guests.
Tonight at the Con. Viennese singer
Robert Montana will give his first Sydney
concert. Robert, who is dark and good-
looking, was chosen in pre-war day by
Franz Lehar to sing Sou Qhong in “The
Land of Smiles” at the Salzburg Festival.
He comes under the management of the
Australian Concert and Artists Pty.
On Saturday next “Annie Get Your
Gun” will have a housewarming at the
Theatre Royal. Judging by the welcome
Annie had in Melbourne, where she was
the tenant of His Majesty’s for a year or
so, Sydney can expect the Royal to be
Annie’s home for many months. This
Hammerstein show, like all his other
brews, has everything in it —love interest,
pathos and plenty of laughs against color-
ful backgrounds. Old Sydney friends
Evie Hayes, Claude Flemming, Marie la
Varre, Sydney Wheeler, Billy Kershaw
and others will be sure of a welcome —a
much warmer one than during the coal
restrictions.
There were two big moments at the
private view of the Society of Artists.
First was tfle arrival of Sydney Ure
Smith, president of the S.O.A. for so
many years, and now resigned through
ill-health. Syd left his room in St, Luke’s
to come to the show, and his was a Royal
progress through the rooms. Everybody
rushed to greet him, and artist Bill Dobell
acted as a sort of friendly bodyguard,
seeing that the invalid did not overdo
things. Second thrill was the arrival
of Larry and Viv Olivier. They popped
in to view the picture painted for them
by Mr. Dobell. Highlight of this is
goldfish in a bowl. Vivien in her
favorite black looked more ethereal and
gossamer-like than ever. Present presi-
dent Douglas Dundas and his wife were
there; so was Daryl Lindsay, who made
the opening speech on Saturday.
From Melbourne
Judging by the great outburst of ap-
plause at its conclusion, ' “Madame
Butterfly” looks like being hard to beat
for popularity in the present grand-opera
season. There were many lovely gowns
in the big audience. Silver foxes set off
that of black tulle worn by Mrs. Frank
Tait, Mrs. G. I. Stevenson’s gown of
dove-grey chiffon had a full-pleated
skirt. Mrs. Jim Fitzgerald and Mrs.
Robert Lindsay chose black velvets, the
former’s being very full-skirted. Mrs.
Ken Myer’s cream chiffons were worn
under a full-length coat of aqua-blue
wool finished with a silver lame collar.
Her sister, Lysbeth Boyd, wore white
moire taffetas with a short fur bolero.
Pastel-blue taffetas were Betty Jones’s
choice, Mrs. T. Allan McKay wore
dusty-pink crepe under a dyed-ermine
coat, Mrs. J. Bowen Pain added a dyed-
ermine bolero to her floral-patterned
French velvet gown. Mrs. Ray Joseph’s
white crepe pleated gown was embel-
lished by a gold lizard-skin belt and
evening-bag ; her wrap was brown water-
mole.
Both stage and stalls glittered with
sequins at the opening night of “Tosca.”
In the title role Fortunati wore a lovely
midnight-blue velvet gown encrusted with
gold sequins—a most effective combina-
tion. Very rich was Lady Herring’s
deep-burgundy crepe gown and short
jacket of velvet in the same shade. Gold
tissue formed the hip-length jacket chosen
by Judith Silk; her sister Joan wore a
heavy white taffeta jacket with narrow
gold-tissue stripes. Mrs. Frank Tail’s
favorite shade of blue comprised her
lovely gown, which was worn with a
silver-fox cape. Mrs. Leigh Falkiner’s
gown was of dove-grey chiffon ; the skirt
very full. Mrs. Tim Jones’s gown of
silver brocade with its undertone of red
had red velvet draped across the bodice;
her wrap was white ermine. Mrs.
Malcolm Johnston added a dyed-ermine
coat to her royal-blue chiffon gown. Gold
sequins trimmed the pale-gold crepe gown
worn by Mrs. Lionel Newton under her
mink coat. Gold satin lined the train
and'short jacket of Mrs. Guy Hutchin-
son’s leaf-green crepe gown. Mrs. W.
G. Carrington’s ensemble was of black
crepe. Alice Adcock’s boufjfant gown of
hyacinth-blue taffetas was worn with a
short white-ermine caps. Mrs. Herbert
Pacini’s gown of garnet-red crushed velvet
had a very full skirt. Mrs. C. Curtain
draped silver leaves down one side of
her coiffure to match her silver lame
gown. Parma-violet chiffons were Mrs.
John Kaufman’s choice.
Joan, younger daughter of Mrs. Victor
Leggo, of St. Kilda-road, and the late
Mr. Victor Leggo, has announced her en-
gagement to David Laidlaw, of Hamil-
ton. Although busy getting her trousseau
together, Joan, who was educated at
Clyde and Merton Hall, still finds time
to work for the Royal Empire Society.
At present she is working on the organ-
ising committee for the Battle of Britain
Ball arranged by the Air Force Women’s
Association, and which is to be held
early next month in St. Kilda Town Hall.

Wedding-bells pealed for Denise, only
child of Or. and Mrs. G, R. Boulton, of
East Melbourne, at Cairns Memorial
Church, when she exchanged vows with
Phillip, younger son of Dr. R. L. G.
Elcoate, of Charlton, and the late Mrs.
Elcoate, The Rev. F. A. Hagenauer
officiated. The bride’s gown was of
white net and lace over a hooped petti-
coat of taffetas; the lace outlined with
silver threads. Her full-length white tulle
veil had a pink silk net foundation, and
set at each side of her face were clusters
of gardenias. Her bouquet was of the
same flowers. Bridesmaid was Joan
Lysaght, of Newcastle, whose pastel-blue
lace gown featured a bouffant skirt and
bertha collar. In her hair she wore deep-
pink roses.
After the reception Cr. and Mrs.
Boulton entertained. at a buffet dinner
in the Gloucester Room of the
Australia. Mrs. Boulton’s gown of pale-
lime French crepe had a deep-cream lace
vestee and draped skirt. Her small black
toque was of velvet. Among the guests
were Sir William and Lady Angliss; the
latter in hip-length black Persian-lamb
jacket, black frock and small pastel-blue
flower hat trimmed with veiling. Jessie
Reid’s floral-patterned French-silk frock
featured a draped skirt; her black hat
was massed with matching satin ribbons.
May Angliss added a small, flower-
trimmed hat to her aqua-blue crepe frock.
Bunty Lee’s black frock had the new
petticoat hemline of brightly-striped
taffetas; her small black hat, trimmed
with flowers, was swathed in veiling. Mrs.
Allan McKay’s hat matched her fur-
trimmed brown coat.
Raincoats and winter tweeds were the
most popular choice for the Melbourne
Racing Club’s inaugural meeting at
Flemington, and tartan umbrellas formed
a contrasting note to many an ensemble.
Mrs. Frank Bladin was tailored in rich
browns with a fur collar; her small
brown hat had gold-toned ruched satin
ribbon. Mrs. Massey Burnside’s large
flat beret with its trimmings of brown
wings was worn with a tailored brown
coat. Mrs. James Buchanan contrasted
her winter-white coat with a brown hat.
Mrs. Knox Knight’s black tailored coat
was teamed with a soft-green swathed felt
hat. Mrs. Victor Cornaga wore a black
ensemble and off-the-face hat. A purple
hat carrying fuschia-toned ribbon made
tasteful adjunct to Mrs. W. Cox’s dyed-
ermine coat. Mrs. R. Sneddon’s navy
tailored suit was worn with a matching
felt, turned sharply off-the-face.
To meet the Chinese Ambassador, Dr.
Kan Nai-Kuang, Consul Martin Wang
and his wife held reception in the Aus-
tralia’s Venetian Court. Mrs. Wang
helped her husband receive the many
guests in a national gown, fashioned of
oyster-grey satin, closely embroidered
with flowers in pastel tones and worn
under a hip-length grey-fox coat. Lady
Gengoult Smith combined beige and
black tastefully in hat and frock over
which was worn a threequarter-lenglh
black Persian-lamb jacket. Mrs. Claude
Kingston’s black frock had a tiered
skirt; her hat had touches of blue. Mrs.
Drakeford’s hat qf tulle-trimmed sage-
green felt was worn with black frock
and silver-fox cape. Mrs. G. A. Clowes’s
aqua-blue coat had a beige-fox collar ;
her small hat was fashioned of matching
blue ribbon. Mrs. J. J. Brophy’s dusty-
pink, embroidered cocktail frock was
worn with a matching hat and full-length
fur coat. Mrs. Sturdee, wife of Lieut-
General V. A. H. Sturdee, chose a black
crepe frock, small black hat with velvet
ribbon clustered at one side, and grey
fox cape, Mimi Chisholm’s ballerina
frock was cherry-red. A sage-green hat
offset Mrs. W. K. Burnside’s brown
frock.
For her marriage at Christ Church,
South Yarra, to Flight-Lieut. John Phil-
cox, R.A.F, Reserve, Ronnie Goodlet
(last year’s Miss Victoria), only daughter
of Mr. J. T. Goodlet, of Pascoe Vale,
wore a beautiful gown of silver lame,
the sheer yoke of which continued to
form little sleeves caught with silver bows,
the skirt, draped at the hips, finished in a
bustle bow. Her finger-tip tulle Veil fell
from a coronet of white hyacinths. Gar-
denias and hyacinths comprised the
bouquet. Matron-of-honor was Mrs.
Avis Lock, whose old-world gown of
peacock-green moire taffetas contrasted
with the bouquet of deep-cream hya-
cinths. After the wedding the bride’s
father and stepmother gave a reception
at Queen’s Road Private Club. A pink
rose set between black ospreys trimmed
the large upswept black hat worn by Mrs,
Goodlet with her black crepe romaine
gown and silver-fox furs. Very large
also was the black befeathered hat worn
by Mrs. Dick Powell with her beige
crepe bustle frock. Val Levett’s bonnet
of pastel-pink and blue roses was tied
under her chin with a wide swathe df
pink taffeta ribbon. With her black frock
Dorothy Williams wore a bandeau of
dusty-pink velvet with a large cluster of
pink, blue and green spiky feathers set
at one side. *
Ben Blue and his attractive wife were
guests of honor at a party given by Mr.
and Mrs. Gray Staley at their Brighton
Home. Mrs. Staley’s black frock had a
yoke of powder-blue and was embroidered
with black beads. Mrs. Blue’s frock was
of pinky-beige. Stage stars present at the
party included Norman Lawrence and
Ormonde Douglas and his wife. Judge
Simpson, who is on a holiday from Eng-
land, was with his wife, whose black
frock was worn with a three-quarter coat
showing the swallow backline and edged
with silver-fox fur. With Air-Marshal
Jones was Mrs. Jones, in a black frock
which had a white frilly gilet set into the
bodice.

THE SERVICE MAN
Serious Days in
Europe.
“Ek Dum”: Any assumption
that there will be no war in
Europe is based on the conclu-
sion that the Western Allies will
not make war. This is sound.
The position is that the Wes-
tern Allies could not muster 20
modern divisions and the Rus-
sians could muster at least 100.
There are experts who can be
more exact than this, but the
plain fact is that the where-
abouts of 94 divisions of Rus-
sian troops are known, and at
least 40 of them are outside the
U.S.S.R. and armed to the
teeth.
And there are growing signs
of Russia’s malign intentions, in-
cluding the sudden development
by Communists in Australia of
a campaign against defence in
all forms. Last week’s Sydney
“Tribune,” official organ of the
Central Committee of the party,
declares that
The best defence of Australia lies
not in piling up arms at the cost of
ruinously high taxation, but in sup-
porting the policy put forward by
Soviet delegates to U.N.O. of peace-
ful co-operation among the nations,
general disarmament and outlawing
of atomic and germ weapons of war-
fare.
Why Australia should set the
example by wiping out its de-
fences—such as they are—while
Russia, from which Messrs.
Sharkey and Co. draw inspira-
tion, is armed to the teeth and
has universal conscription is not
explained, but it would be easy
to find an unkind explanation
for it, and there should be
enough cumulative evidence for
authority to deal appropriately
with some of the local ruffians,
especially in view of their open
rejoicing at the report that Aus-
tralian women and children in
Malaya are “living nightly in
their bungalows like goats
chained up for tiger-bait,” and
that some unfortunate wives,
risking murder, rape and mutila-
tion at the hands of the blood-
thirsty immigrant Chinese
savages who are the Australian
Communist party’s friends and
perhaps instruments, stay on
plantations only because to go
away would endanger the lives
of their husbands at the hands of
laborers waiting for the slightest
sign of weakness.
Consistent with War
Moscow’s stand is consistent
with war at any minute. It is
resorting to all the small tricks
of border incidents —such as
that which took place on August
19, when Russian police broke
into the Western Allied zone on
a pretext of pursuing black-
marketeers and kidnapped the
German chief of police in the
U.S. zone and some subordin-
ates. The talks in Moscow
from which optimistic editors
appeared to hope so much have
seemingly been a complete
failure. The Russians appear de-
termined to attain a share in the
management of the Ruhr as a*
preliminary to the Bolshevisa-
tion of the West. The Allies,
however, apparently now know
where they stand.
They know that in their own
countries they havt to deal with
a network of spies and sabo-
teurs, and that in Europe they
stand face to face with a Power
which is apparently preparing to
attack Yugoslavia, at least if
the preparations on the Danube
mean anything; which also
seems to be preparing to take
over Rumania for “defence,”
and which certainly would seize
the Dardanelles as a measure of
war necessity in the event of
hostilities in the Balkans.
It was reported on August 18
that Tito has decided to ap-
proach the Western Allies for
help in the event of attack by
the U.S.S.R. and that he has no
illusions about the fact that the
Kremlin intends to liquidate him
—if he has any doubt he must
be a very trusting fellow.
The same day it leaked out
that on August 12, before dawn,
General Yovanovitch, Tito’s
Chief of Staff during his parti-
san days (when every daily
paper was convinced that he and
his half-armed rabble were hold-
ing up more German divisions!
than the Allied armies in Italy),
was discovered sneaking across
the border to the East and shot,
along with Svetlik Aribijac,
Director of Frontier State
Lands.
Major-General Branko Pet-
richevich was captured, and a
colonel escaped.
Yugoslav oil supplies, which
formerly came from Rumania,
have been stopped, and all plans
appear to have been made for
imposing economic sanctions on
Yugoslavia.
The Kasenkina Case
Relations between Russia and
the Western Allies worsened
when the United States State
Department demanded that
Lomakin, the Consul-General in
New York, be recalled in view
of his forcible detention of the
Soviet schoolteacher, Mrs.
Kasenkina, who elected to re-
main in the United States. Since
the Russian Ambassador and
even Molotov himself have
backed Lomakin to the hilt, the
stern Note which the depart-
ment has ostensibly aimed at the
Consul-General is aimed in
reality at the whole U.S.S.R.
Government, which has adopted
a provocative and dishonest tone
throughout.
When Moscow Radio detailed
the events in New York and the
discussions in Moscow it failed
to say that Mr. BedeH-Smith, the
U.S. Ambassador, had emphati-
cally denied the Russian charges
or that he had said that if any
of the Russians expressed a wish
to return to their homeland their
travel would be facilitated. The
Soviet viewpoint was expressed
by “Izvestia,” one of the two
official Government organs:
The whole Soviet land will not
permit any offence against its people,
no matter where they are. Soviet
public opinion demands the liberation
of the abducted Soviet citizens, and a
detailed investigation of this out-
rageous crime and the proper punish-
ment of the culprits. It. demands that
the dirty hands of political gangsters
do not dare to touch the citizens of
the great Soviet Union.
In Berlin
In Berlin the atmosphere must
seem homelike to relicts of the
Nazi regime, except for the
starvation, which did not exist
in pre-war Hitler Germany. The
Russian-controlled press is full
this week of vicious personal
attacks on Allied commanders,
and particularly on General
Clay (U.S.), whose withdrawal
is demanded. The “National
Zeitung” attacks U.S. citizens in
general in gutter language and
sneers at the “miserable
Tommies” of the British force
kept in a place which they are
eager to leave out of shame —
but in which they are retained
for purposes of national prestige.
Life in Berlin for the Allies of
the West, says the “National
Zeitung,” is now a “nightmare.”
One significant incident during
the week, apart from the return
of Marshal Sokolovsky, seemed
to show that Moscow talks had
failed definitely. The Russians
gave formal notice that their
part in the Four-Power govern-
ment of Berlin had ended by
hauling down their flag on the
Kommandatura and removing
their sentry and order-board,
leaving behind only portraits of
Lenin and Stalin.
At any moment it is ex-
pected that they will set up a
new Magistrat, which is the con-
stitutional body to which the
Allies now pass on their orders.
Already the Communist press
has begun to attack the proce-
dures of the Magistrat as “a
crime against Berlin.”
Meanwhile the miserable Ber-
liners, starved and chivvied
about, forced into the black-
market to get a crust and swept
when they go out by one of the
worst series of storms which the
city has suffered in recent years,
are beginning to get out of hand.
At the week-end matters took
an ever more serious complexion
in Berlin.
With British and U.S. guards
trying to hold a line between
the western and eastern sectors,
Russian troops, armed with
tommy-guns, marched about and
occasionally swooped.
First they grabbed two more
German police in the Allied
zone, knocked one unconscious
with the butt of a rifle and
stabbed the other, according to
the Americans. The Russians
described the story as an “in-
vention.”
An American photographer
was seized and assaulted. The
Russians tried to drag him into
the Soviet zone. Two other Ger-
mans were pursued with tommy-
guns, and only saved from
capture inside Western territory
when an Allied patrol appeared.
There is little ground for hope
in the situation. The Moscow
talks obviously have had no
chance of permanent success
from the beginning. There the
Russians have been merely play-
ing for time. There was still less
hope after the attempts by the
Russian Consul - General in
America to remove U.S.S.R.
citizens from the United States
under duress. And obviously
none at all after the new policy
in Berlin was established, while
"A little more elevation, Jack."
the discussions were actually in
progress.
On Sunday afternoon armed
Russians' kidnapped a U.S. In-
formation Control officer inside
the British zone at the Pots-
damer Platz and took him away
in a jeep.
The world can make up its
mind that it is very near war,
and that the decision as to
whether it will actually take
place or not lies squarely on
Russian shoulders.
More Bloodshed in
Malaya.
“Ek Dum”: Backed by the
gloating of the Australian Com-
munists, the horrible gang of
terrorists which is threatening
destruction to Malaya goes on
its bloodthirsty way. It is
operating from the hills which
are a feature of the centre of the
narrow peninsula. Its slogan is:
“Murder, rob and run.” It can-
not be called a fighting force in
the true sense of the word.
It has its depots in Siam, where
it is reported to have strong
concentrations near the border,
but it ravages right into the
suburbs of Kuala Lumpur, the
capital. It menaces women and
children and helpless villagers.
It is about as loathsome a form
of rabble as it is possible to find
—a rabble not indigenous to the
country which it seeks to destroy
—the invading bandits of a
foreign Power without any
respect for the Geneva Conven-
tion or any of the rules of
humanity or civilised warfare.
The objective is not freedom
for the Malayans. It is based on
the anxiety of Russia to deny
British tin and rubber to the
British and American defence
forces and to have control of
them for its own use. The cam-
paign is part of the revolu-
tionary war on the civilised
world, and, as it was on the side
of Germany during the last war,
so long as Hitler and Stalin were
hand-in-hand, so is the Com-
munist party in Australia on the
side of the murderers, though 10
people of British race have been
cruelly done to death by these
cowardly Chinese savages in a
few days.
The Australian Government
does nothing. It is still waiting
for some “request” to be made
to it while weary Britain con-
tinues to denude her own de-
fences of crack regiments to pro-
tect Australia’s defensive door-
mat —the key point outside Aus-
tralian territory in our northern
defences.
If this country values its
safety the Communist party and
all its organisations must be
dealt with now under the De-
fence Act. Using its own wea-
pons and selecting its own
battlegrounds, it is at war with
Australia, at war with Britain
and at war with the United
States.
Yet Canberra nurses it and
allows it also to red-ant the
scientific side of the civil service
and the universities.
Australia Out.
“Ek Dum”: Indirect con-
firmation of the story, denied
vigorously by Mr. Dedman, that
the United States was not giving
its atom secrets to its Australian
allies has been made by Mr.
David Lilienthal, head of the
United States Atomic Energy
Commission.
He said that Britain, the
United States and Canada were
continuing their joint work in the
development of atomic energy.
All three were carrying on the
co-operation which had been
found beneficial in war-time in
certain limited fields and all
three were represented in con-
sultations on “certain topics.”
These do not, of course, in-
clude specific atomic weapons,
but developments which lead to
their invention are included.
Australia is neither sharing in
nor contributing to atomic re-
search. It is years behind every
other white-ruled major portion
of the British Commonwealth
and decades behind Britain, the
United States and Canada. And
it has no chance of catching up,
thanks to the Government
policy, which has all along
been paraphrased from • Mr.
Micawber.
Iwakuni as a World
Airport.
With the shift of (he Qantas
Empire Airways service from
Bofu (Japan), Iwakuni, in the
8.C.0.F. area, has become the
Japanese air centre for two
world air services British
Overseas Airways Corporation
from England and Qantas from
Australia.
The designing and construc-
tion of this new airstrip which
has given 8.C.A.1.R. base at
Iwakuni the best airstrip in
Japan outside Haneda were done
by Wing-Commander A. M.
Harrison, C.O. of No. 5 Air-
field Construction Squadron,
R.A.A.F.
Work began in November,
1947, and the first concrete was
laid on January 5.
At dawn on April 9 of this
year Group - Captain Brian
Eaton, C.O. of 81 Wing,
R.A.A.F., made the first take-
off from the strip in his Mus-
tang- •
The new strip runs north-
south to take full advantage
of available space, is free
from hills and relatively free
from bad flying weather. It is
central in the 8.C.0.F. area and
is linked to key points through-
out Japan by road, rail, launch
and air. There is a ground-
control approach system (radar)
to guide aircraft in bad weather.
Although few of the original
members of Five A.C.S. were
present to help in the construc-
tion of the new airstrip, almost
all the personnel in the squadron
have served with airfield-con-
struction squadrons during the
war.
The squadron, last of the 14
airfield - construction squadrons
in the R.A.A.F. during the war,
went into action in 1942, and
its first job, Ward Field,-New
Guinea, was the first airfield
made by the Allies during the
Pacific War.
The Fifth A.C.S. has built
about 20 airfields from Moresby
to Japan, most of them carved
from virgin jungle. Wing-Com-
mander Harrison, formerly of
Folly Point, North Sydney,
N.S.W., a civil engineer before
the war, has designed and super-
vised the construction of 10 air-
strips.
In June, 1947, his squadron
completed the concrete runway
at Bofu, and throughout the
occupation they have been re-
sponsible for the whole of the
troop accommodation, de-
pendent housing and water
supplies for Bofu, Miho and
Iwakuni air-bases.
Wing-Commander Harrison’s
righthand men in this work were
Flying-Officer A. H. Perry,
Warrant-Officer J. Morris, and
Flight-Sergeant J. McLean.
Flight-Lieutenant B. D. Mc-
Gregor, also of the Fifth A.C.S.,
was officer-in-charge of plant
and transport maintenance. A
small detachment of sappers
from Nth Aust. Workshop and
Park Squadron helped to manage
Japanese plant operators, and
two officers from that unit were
temporarily attached to the Fifth
A.C.S. for important jobs—
Lieut. D. Cole, in charge of test-
ing materials and the determina-
tion and bearing values of the
airstrip, and Lieut. A. Saunders,
officer-in-charge of field super-
vision of plant and earth-moving
equipment.
Work on the strip absorbed
112,756 working hours by
R.A.A.F. personnel and 250,000
Japanese man-hours. It occupied
every daylight hour of the
winter with an average of 30
R.A.A.F. men and 300 Japanese
on the job. Sometimes the unset
concrete partially froze, and
some sections of the strip had to
be replaced after having been
laid.
Japanese have been taught by
members of the Fifth A.C.S.
how to handle the heavy earth-
moving equipment, and by the
time the strip was completed
these machines had worked a
total of 66,500 hours.
“A strip of this kind com-
pares favorably with any in Aus-
tralia,” said Wing-Commander
Harrison, “and in that country
it would cost £A500,000. This
field enables unrestricted opera-
tion of the heaviest type of air-
craft up to 160,0001 b. gross
weight.”
The concrete strip is 5000 ft
long with 500 ft. in overruns of
gravel. Width of the strip itself
is* 150 ft., and there is an addi-
tional 75ft.-wide stretch of grave!
on each side.
Landings and take-offs aver-
age from 50 to 60 each a dav
The field could handle as many
aircraft per day as Mascot.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The outcome of all the recent
hullabaloo about courses and clubs
in Melbourne has been the formation
of a Melbourne Racing Club, merging
the old Williamstown and Ascot
shows. The new body was copiously
christened by heavy rain at Fleming-
ton on Saturday. A heavy track up-
set most calculations, and backers of
favorites had a rough spin during the
first five races before the popular
picks Perm (W. Williamson) and Dick
Turpin (W. A. Smith), starting at
twos and 11 to 4 respectively, won
the divisions of the mile Belhaven
Handicap for four-year-olds.
Owner E. V. Lawrence collected a
tangible memento of the occasion
when his seven-year-old John James
gelding Britisher downed Dashing
Beau and Vantage in the 12-furlongs
Inauguration Cup, bagging £BOO cash
prize plus a £2OO gold pot. Vantage
was favorite for the Cup, but passed
the post lengths behind the first pair,
who fought out a close finish.
Lady Antonel, a chestnut filly by
Portofino-Lady Ormsby, suggested
herself as an Oaks prospect when she
soundly beat Raysun, Waezieri and
other three-year-olds in the seven-
furlongs Effingham Handicap. Her
rider, young Eames, after jumping
her out smartly from the barrier,
eased her back in the field, allowed
her time to settle down thoroughly,
then called for a powerful finishing
run which the filly produced like a
good ’un. In the second division
of the Effingham, Dhoti was repre-
sented by five runners, and Bon Dhoti
(W. Williamson) collected the cash,
defeating High Tar and Najera.
Known as a moderate sort of
stayer on the flat, the nine-year-old
Enfield gelding Field Balloon (K.
Rhimes) was seen in. a new role when
he won the Sandhurst Hurdle; un-
fortunately for punters, Lugano, in
the same race, was seen once again
in the familiar part of beaten favorite.
At nine, Field Balloon sounds a
bit old in the tooth to be winning
races, but New Warrior (M. Fitz-
gerald), who won the Anglesey Handi-
cap, can spot him a couple of years.
New Warrior finished much too well
for the favorite, Decorate. Lungi, an
early fancy for the Melbourne Cup,
commenced his racing preparation
with a run in the six-furlongs Ches-
terfield Handicap, and, though un-
placed, finished surprisingly close up;
the race was won by Gilwell (A.
Breasley).
* * * *
This year’s A.J.C. Derby should
be a race of exceptional interest.
There’s a promising bunch of local
three-year-olds on the scene, and the
increased prizemoney of £lO,OOO
should attract the best from other
States. Ungar and Carbon Copy are
definite contenders from Melbourne,
and the South Australian represen-
tative Comic Court made his Sydney
debut at Canterbury on Saturday.
Comic Court contested the Three-
year-old Handicap (7if.) and did
reasonably well to finish fifth, a
couple of lengths behind the bunch
of horses fighting out the places;
Bonnie Prince (W. Cook) won from
Wingen and Foxzami. Comic Court
carried a plaster of 9.11 and seemed
more interested in the unaccustomed
surroundings than the job in hand;
his rider, J. Thompson, said, more-
over, that the colt made heavy
weather of the turn into the straight;
he should do belter at Randwick.
Although overshadowed by another
South Australian equine family in
G. W. Badman’s numerous “Gems,”
the offspring of ' Powerscourt-Witty
Maid are a pretty fair bunch. Some
years back the brothers Bowyer, of
Normanville Stud (S.A.), bought
Powerscourt for £BO and Witty Maid
for £5O; the first three colts pro-
duced in successive years by the
mating of this pair were sold for
2000 guineas, 2300 guineas and 3000
guineas respectively. First was
Comedy Prince, who won eight races
from 10 starts as a two-year-old;
then came Comic Court, followed by
St, Comedy, who, a couple of weeks
back in Adelaide, won the Fulham
Park Handicap, the first two-year-old
race of the season.
For a couple of riders, Saturday’s
meeting at Canterbury was one to
remember with regret. George Moore
had reason to be pleased after win-
ning the first Welter on Meteor, for
it was his first success since a broken
collarbone put him out of action
some time back. In the second
Burwood Mixed (9f.), however,
Moore’s mount, Union Jack, after
passing the post first in a bustling
finish, lost the race, on a protest, to
Binnaway, and Moore was given two
months’ suspension—very expensive
for him with the important spring
racing so close to hand. Another
rider to “get it in the neck” was
T. Clarke, giyen two months’ suspen-
sion for careless riding of Cardinal
Colour, who finished unplaced in the
Campsie Mixed (Ilf.) won by Valilla
(N. Sellwood); Clarke only recently
resumed riding after a year’s “holi-
day.”
With three horses very nearly
deadheating for first and one of them
the even-money favorite Deep Sea,
the judge must have been very pleased
to have the camera available for the
finish of the Flying. It showed that
Dutchman (W. Briscoe) had won by
a half-head, with Deep Sea and Lucky
Escape deadheating for second place.
Deep Sea had tried to lead all the
way, the other pair coming on the
outside to collar him in the last stride.
“I do wish you wouldn't talk while I'm putting."
Much less nerve-wracking for suc-
cessful punters were the wins of
Smooth Action beating High Order
and Golden Plumes in the Canterbury
Park Handicap (9f.), of Blue Tulip
(J. Thompson) in the second Welter
and of Bikini (N. Sellwood) in the
first Burwood Mixed.

Passed on in Sydney on Monday
after a long illness, Australia’s leading
studmaster Percy Miller. Yearlings
from his Kia-Ora Stud, where stand
Agincourt, Channel Swell, Delville
Wood, Le Grand Due and last sea-
son’s leading sire, Midstream, have
topped the sales for years now, and
they have included many a topnotch
horse.

Various no doubt well-meaning

Thanks mainly to Sidwell, the only
improver in the team, Australia won

both his singles while Quist beat the
Czech second string Cernik.

Defeat for Richmond, Carlton and
Fitzroy in Melbourne on Saturday
somewhat altered the V.F.L. “four,”
leaving Essendon high and clear,
Collingwood next, then Melbourne
and the in-and-out Footscray. Rich-
mond was never in the hunt against
Collingwood, 15.18 to 10.12, and
only in the second quarter, when they
had a point lead, did Carlton show
out against Essendon, 16.15-11.11.
Fitzroy had its sixth successive loss,
this time to Footscray, 11.15-9.9, St.
Kilda nearly had another win, beaten
three points by North Melbourne,
7.19-8.10, and Melbourne ambled
around M.C.G. lazily scoring now and
then to beat South, 15.13-7.12. While
all this was going on Hawthorn went
to Geelong and in a rattling good
game won by a point, 11.15-11.14,
Geelong kicking two goals in the last
few mmutes after trailing most of
the way.
Many leading Union players were
away on Saturday with the N.S.W.
team playing Queensland and suffer-
ing a 24-15 hiding. Despite the
absence of Windon, however, Rand-
wick walked over St. George, 13-3,
to go even further ahead in the
premiership score. In other matches
Parramatta beat Eastwood 14-6,
Northern Suburbs beat Drummoyne
11-6, Manly beat University 22-14,
and Gordon licked Easts 8-2. Rand-
wick, Gordon, Manly and Easts enter
the semi-finals.

The cricketers:-
The fifth Test at the Oval was an
unhappy affair, with England col-
lapsing in dispirited fashion for 52
in the first innings and 188 in the
second; Australia knocked up 389
te win by an innings and 149 runs.
Suffice to say that Morris, off his
own bat, made 44 runs less than the
English total for two innings. Fine
bowling by our chaps played its part,
Lindwall taking nine for 70, John-
ston six for 60 and Miller four for
27.
Fresh from 10 years’ enforced spell,
Test cricket statisticians have been
having a royal old time during the
recent series, conjuring up new
“records” from every trivial happen-
ing of the game. Some are worth
recording; others are such as inspired
a writer in an English magazine, “The
Listener,” to pen:
There was a young player called
Rover,
Who bowled sixteen wides in one over,
Which had never been done
By an archdeacon’s son
On a Tuesday, in August, at Dover.
One record, of sorts, well worth
recording is that Toshack, the com-
plete no-hoper with the bat and only
real “rabbit” in the Australian side,
by devious mischance wound up with
a Test average of over 50 —better
than any of the England bats ex-
cept Compton (562, average 62.44).
Washbrook (356, average 50.85) and
Hutton (342, average 30.9) did next
best for England. Heading the tourists
were Morris. (696, av. 87), Barnes
(329, av. 82.25) and Bradman (508,
av. 72.57).
Commencing today the Australians
play The Gentlemen of England, a
match which a London “Times” head-
ing succinctly described as “Gentle-
men v. The Australians.”
* * * *
Johnny Davis (8.13) deserved his
Leichhardt success against Ray Cole-
man (8.12£), though Coleman was
clearly the better boxer and a trifle
unlucky in that he damaged his right
thumb in the first round and there-
after had to rely entirely on his left.
Davis attacked continuously and the
harder he was hit (by solid left rips)
the harder he came back; a popular
points decision.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: McSteak, the cattle-
dealer, tearing through the back country
on some business or other, stopped his
dusty car before the Bogan Gate pub,
went to the post-office, came back, irri-
gated, and headed for the dining-room.
His two blue dogs sotted themselves out
of the heap of suitcases, bags and what-
not in the back of the car and set out
to investigate the village. They treed the
garage cat, put a stray horse into the
schoolground, brought upon themselves
the combined cahine force of Bogan Gate
and fought with it from the store veran-
dah out into the road and back again.
The dogfight was at its height, with dust
and hair flying everywhere, and sundry
citizens and small boys either urging the
combatants on or trying to stop them,
when the barman rushed into the dining-
room and yelled “Hey, Mr McSteak,
your dogs is in a brawl.” McSteak went
out, surveyed the tangled mass of swear-
ing, biting hounds calmly, stepped to the
car and gave two short blasts on the
horn. Out of the melde emerged the two
heelers. They raced to the car and into
the back seat, where McSteak slammed
the door on them and said “Y’ve had
your fun. Wait there till I finish me
dinner.” Ten minutes later the McSteak
outfit was a cloud of dust fading up the
Tottenham-road and Bogan Gate went
back to sleep.

“Carlyle”: Tell “The Rabbiter” (B.
4/8/’4B) there are other instances of
friendly lyrebirds. In the bush garden
of relatives living on the Kallista edge
of the Sherbrooke Forest (Vic.), lyrebirds
are a common sight, and remain undis-
turbed by the family’s movements. Per-
haps the best known is: James, the
splendid male Menura which made a
friend of Mrs. Wilkinson, of Ferny Creek,
whose property (on the fringe of the
same forest) includes a gully of virgin
bush. The bird first visited Mrs. Wilkin-
son in February, 1930, and although at
first it was content to follow her about
the garden, later it got into the habit of
singing and dancing on the verandah-
ledge under her sitting-room window, and
would announce his arrival (often at
dawn) by tapping on the window-pane.
Parental duties kept him av/ay for three
months from September to December,
and during his absence that first year Mrs.
Wilkinson, confident of his return, built
a special platform from which he later
delighted ornithologists from all over
Australia. Through the sitting-room
window they studied and photographed
James, and recordings were made of his
liquid notes. Perhaps the bird’s most
remarkable feat occurred in 1931 during
his patroness’s illness; he located her
bedroom and built a mound outside from
which he entertained her with mimicry
and dancing. The last I heard of him
was in 1940, when he was still spending
two hours a day in the lady’s company.

“Esk D.”: Mart Sankey’s clearing-sale
is a huge affair, and there is a large crowd
present from all parts of the district. The
men gather in a deep circle about the
auctioneer and his offsider while being
invited to fall over themselves bidding for
a large hunk of unidentified machinery
Mart picked up 30 years ago at a similar
sale and left it in the weather to rust. It
is better not to leave the throng and
wander, for Mart’s place is noted for its
fleas in a flea-ridden district, and around
most corners of the buildings there are
agitated females trying to get rid of blood-
thirsty insects and avoid embarrassment
simultaneously. But the auctioneer grows
hoarse as he can’t get a 10-bob bid, and
the mob are poking borak at him. “Buy
the ruddy thing y’rself an’ git on with the
sale,” one old chap beefs out through his
whiskers, “Give y’ a deener f’r it,” pipes
a smart Alec, and the auctioneer is right
on his wheel. “Done,” he roars and
moves on quickly to put up the milking-
machines, Alec joins in the general roar
of amusement till remembering that con-
ditions of the sale are that all lots sold
are to be removed from the property
within a fortnight. A bit of quick figur-
ing nets him the discovery that he won’t
get the ton-and-a-half of rusted iron taken
away and dumped in the scrub for less
than a couple of quid.

“Scrub Itch”: It was a freezing night
as we came into the hut and found Joe
snoring. Jack went ovqr and shook him.
“Hey, Joe, why don’t you pull your feet
in out of the cold?” he asked. Joe
blinked dopily, “Aw, I dunno,” he said
as) he turned over. “Anyway, them
urgers are big enough to look after
’emselves! ”
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: I’ve seen double-
headed pennies (B. 28/7/’4B), and I have
evidence that one was used on a troop-
ship on the way to the Middle East, but
I’ve always marvelled at the courage, or
stupidity, of the ringkeeper who intro-
duced them into a game. The rules of
two-up are simple, and are rigidly ad-
hered to. They are that the pennies be
placed, one head and one tail showing,
“Any ice today ?”
on the kip by the ringkeeper, who ex-
amines them after each toss. They must
spin, and may be barred, for all ring
bets, by the keeper, or by any ring bettor,
or for any individual side-bet by either of
the bettors—while the pennies are in the
air. After they hit the ground the keeper
is the sole and final arbiter. The keeper
is, therefore, the only man who could
introduce a double-header into the game
with any hope of success, and, contrary
to the general belief, he is the one who
most benefits from a run of heads—on
the third pair of heads and on every
second pair thereafter he takes the
original stake out of the centre. In fact,
as in any other mugs’ game, the man
who runs it cops the lot. But you can’t
tell a fellow that when he’s just tossed the
kip after throwing 13 heads.
♦ * * ♦
“Kelms”: On what part of a horse is
put the greatest strain when it is pulling
a heavy load (B. 28 /7 / ’4B) ? Dead
centre. Watch a horse straining in the
collar and you’ll see its stomach muscles
tauten. Feel its belly, which you’ll find
hard as a board. Indulge in a little self-
analysis next time you tax your strength
and you’ll find the same thing. Your
limbs may strain and ache, but it’s your
stomach that takes the load, and it’s your
stomach that will ache longest from pro-
longed strain. And how often have you
seen a small man succeed where a bigger
man failed simply because while the big
bloke had the limbs the midget had the
guts?
* ♦ ♦ ♦
“Frank Humphrey”; “They’re sup-
posed to be dots’,'* I said, indicating the
huge white cat by the open fire. “Oh,
Jimmy’s not deaf,” Bill said. “He hears
everything. Follows me like a dog when
I go hunting in the scrub, but he’s been
afraid of anything that looks like a rep-
tile ever since he saw his mate swal-
lowed by a python. He showed it when
he was out with me and the dogs flushed
out a big old sand goanna. Jimmy sees it
and goes up the nearest tree. The go.
makes for the very same vegetable. When
he sees the go. spiralling up" after him
Jimmy’s shape altered. He didn’t seem
to look much like a cat any more. His
fur stuck out every way as he backed
higher and higher up the tree, mad with
fright. He looked like a ball of cotton-
wool with two little fires in it. The dogs
were barking and leaping round the
trunk, and the old go. kept climbing, and
Jimmy kept clawing his way further and
further out on to the highest and longest
limb, I moved round to get a shot at the
go., hut that only kept him climbing,
and there was no room now for Jimmy
to retreat. I reckoned he thought his
number was up when the goanna
reached the branch he was on. That de-
cided Jimmy. The nearest tree was a
good 20 feet away, but he never hesi-
tated ; took off like a rocket, through the
tops of the trees, barely touching them.
The last I saw of him he looked like a
white cockatoo flying just above the top
branches and heading for home.”

“C.E.”: Among Steve’s possessions on
the shelf above his bunk were two books.
He had owned them well over 20 years,
had read them innumerable times, and
could recite many paragraphs from
memory. One was a Nat Gould opus,
the other a wild-western. To Steve, the
characters were old friends. They had
kept him company down the years, and,
huddled over the fire on winter nights,
he still grieved with them over every
mishap and chuckled at each break of
fortune. Seeing him poring nightly over
his meagre library, Ted decided to give
the old bloke a treat. “Brought you
over a new book to read,” he announced.
“No hurry with it. Keep it as long as
you like.” Steve thanked him uncer-
tainly. The nights crept into weeks, the
weeks added to a couple of months, then
Steve presented himself at Ted’s to return
the book. “How’d you like it?” Ted
asked him. The old chap looked thought-
ful. “Aw, well,” he summed up weightily,
“1 don’t say them folks mightn’t be all 7
right if y’ got t’ know ’em prop’ly. But,
as it is, well” He paused, and shook
his head bewilderedly. “Well, cripes, a
man never knows what the silly cows are
gonna do nextl”
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: Schoolboy nicknames
can be bewildering (B. 21/7/’4B), but the
reason is generally traceable to corrup-
tions from the original. For instance,
the biggest larrikin in 5B bore the nick-
name of Saint. He still carried it when
I met him 12 years later. Yet he was
named in satire or sarcasm. His surname
was Twitchins, and some brilliant nomen-
clator had received the inspiration; “St.
Vitus.” Natural abbreviation did the rest.
A boy who had lost one eye cruelly be-
came “Cyclops” after we had had the
Iliad for supplementary reading. He
took exception to the title, and squashed
the name and the christener’s nose with a
wild swipe delivered behind the outhouse
that formed a screen for such affairs of
honor. Miraculously his nickname
changed to Nelson, and so gradual was
the evolution to Nell that he failed to
notice any reflection on his masculinity.
One of the promptest christenings I ever
saw was inflicted on the quiet son of
foreign parents. At half-past nine he told
the teacher his surname: Phizgwig. At
playtime he was Fizz-quick, and at lunch
he had become Seidlitz. Tims —and a
discovered ability to score tries —softened
the stigma. He became Sed, and finally
Sid.
* * * *
“Eastern”: Mike was propped against
the counter yarning to the store bloke.
“Yair, there’s more in this game than
meets the eye,” old George remarked.
“Soon as the mob hear of something
short that’s in, they all come wanting it.
A mart’s got to use his head to see it’s
rationed fair. Y’ get good at it, too —offer
’em practically, nothing, then come up
a bit, and they think they’ve scored a
sixer. Here’s Beerpuller now. Watch me
handle him.” With a sly wink he turned
to his customer. “Heard you got some
small gates in, George,” Bung greeted
affably. “Could you let us have half-a-
dozen?” The storeman’s eyes narrowed
shrewdly. “ ’Fraid I couldn’t,” he an-
nounced regretfully. “You see, I only
got a. few.” “Yes, but you know what
it s like round a pub, George,” the other
persisted. “Got to have things a bit
decent, y’ know, and I’ve been waiting a
Ipng time.” George nodded thoughtfully.
Might let you have one,” he decided.
One! But what about my horse-yard
gate?” Bung protested. “And that one
into the garden? And those at the back?”
Tell you what,” the store bloke relented
visibly. “Seeing it’s you, I’ll let you
have two ; but keep it to y’self, won’t
you? Fl] put ’em aside.” With a grin at
Mike, he disappeared. “Bad luck,” Mike
remarked, strolling out with Bung. The
pub-owner chuckled. “Aw, not so bad,”
he whispered. “Y* see, I only wanted
two.”

“Bo”; Old Horace, who in the dim
past had been in a broker’s office in the
city, had been told by Marsden to take
two horses into the saleyards in the town.
Horace left on his commission early in
the morning. About nine o’clock that
night he rolled in, in just about that well-
defined state of complete satisfaction with
the world and everyone in it. Asked how
he had got on, the old derelict gaily con-
fessed that he had lost one of the horses —
but he had delivered the other. The boss
hit the roof, but the expression of his ire
was interrupted by the philosopher. “Blesh
my soul!” he said in his still-cultured
voice. “Why thishs cavilling? You're
shtill getting fifty per shent return on
your outlay—and thash more’n than any
public comp’ny I know paysh in divi-
dendsh!”

“Bon-Accord”: One of the swampers
had been carted off to hospital with a
broken leg. When Big George, the
teamster, came in and was told about it
he said, “If you’d only told me about it
I could have fixed him up easy enough.”
“Bit of a bush-doctor, are you, George?”
asked Charlie. “Too right I am, and a
good one, too. I remember one time a
skinny little mate o’ mine busted his leg
pretty crook. Bones slickin’ out every-
where, I X-rayed him, set the leg, and
he never had a bit o’ bother. Matter o’
fact, he won foot-races afterwards.”
“How do you mean you X-rayed him?”
asked Charlie, “Easy,” replied George.
“I just held him up to the sun — I told
you he was a skinny bloke.”
* * * ♦
“8.A.”; I was fishing off a rocky bank
in a quiet cove on the Tasmanian north
coast when a boy arrived carrying a long,
light bamboo-rod and a sugarbag. Tak-
ing a hefty beef bone out of the bag he
tossed it in an open spot among the sea-
weed and kelp. He then worked a length
of thin copper-wire into a running loop
similar to a possum snare and fastened it
to the rod about a foot from the top. Pre-
sently a couple of crayfish emerged from
the weeds and approached the bone. The
boy waited until he got a clear fore-and-
aft view of one of the crays,
thrust the rod down until the looped
wire was diiecdy behind it and touched
it lightly. The crustacean reacted with
a smart backward flip, the loop tightened
around its body and the fisherman lifted
it from the water.

“Laetilia”: Pourri-pourri certainly dies
hard on the Torres Strait island of Sai-
bai (B. 11/8/’4B). 1 was there in 1934
at the height of a bad malaria epidemic
and found that shining lights of “Gub-
mint” and “mishun” school and at least
one dusky clerk-in-holy-orders had for-
sworn the quinine issued by officialdom
in favor of the older treatment of the
pourri-pourri practitioner. The suffering
population, from drooling old men to
pot-bellied infants, were lacerated from
head to toe in order to “let the bad
blood out.” At the time the “mana” of
the exponents of the cult was rendered
mighty by two mysterious chains of
coincidences. A shell-diving boy named
Tumia emerged so badly mutilated from
a shark attack that only by superb
stitchery at the hands of a medicine-
man from Sydney University did he sur-
vive, On his return to his home island
of Sai bai the day after his discharge
from Thursday Island hospital Tumia
was fatally bitten by the only specimen
of venomous reptile in Torres Strait.
Aniba, a skin-diver, managed to elude
another sea-tiger, whereupon the cutter
up-anchored and moved to another
bed some 12 miles away. Aniba did no;
take his first dive till late in the after-
noon, thouglj all the other crew member?
worked the bed all day. He had his right

Still, pourri-pourri is not invariably
malevolent. Love philtres are part of the
magic man’s stock-in-trade, though, con-
trary to European practice, it is the
sufferer from unrequited passion and not
the unresponsive one who absorbs the
potion. On one island official investiga-
tion unearthed an altruistically-minded
citizen who demanded from his feminine
clientele no other fee than the right to
test personally the efficacy of his own
prescriptions.
BLACKMEN’S PICTURES.
Symbols on the cliff-side —pictures in a row,
Graven by the blackmen in the long ago;
Pictures of an old kind, strangers to the eye,
Hidden in the ranges where the shadows lie:
They can tell a story, those who read them say,
Of the blackman’s knowledge of his yesterday.
When a drift of moonlight bathes the Barlee
Range,
Slanting its enchantment, changing never-
change;
When the sleeping bellbird wakes to voice his
chime
Rise the ancient blackmen who are one with
time;
Come from out the shadows, weather-scarred
and grim.
From their secret caverns ever hushed and dim.
Spirits of a people lost beyond recall
Gather round their pictures on the painted wall,
Whispering together in the oldest tongue
Truths that were not tecrets when the world
was young;
When the moon is shining on the Barlee Range,
Slanting its enchantment, changing never-
change.

“C.E.”: The new carrier hadn’t been
operating in the township long before
Bob discovered a number of his lifelong
customers were giving the new firm a
trial. At first he said nothing, but as the
months passed and more of the locals
transferred their business, the old driver
found his loads to the railway town 70
miles away growing lighter and almost
unpayable. He began taking secret stock
of the consignments on his competitor’s
truck, noting their destination and, more
especially, the condition in which the
goods were delivered.- At length he pre-
sented himself at the garage of his opposi-
tion. “It ain’t that I want to criticise, me
lad,” he told the youthful owner, “but I
been in this game all me life, an’ for
the sake o’ the district and the business
gen’rally, it’s better for me to show y’
the main points in this here carryin’ job.
Y’ see, the way you’re goin’ about things
ain’t fair to the folks. Livin’ ’way out
here, they got to have a transport service,
ain’t they? ’Course. And, t’ make
it profitable, what we wants is back-
loadin’. Awright, then, don’t y’ see, if
y’ ain’t careful, there ain’t enough of it.
Use y’r head, me lad. Gripes, the way
you’re deliverin’ folk’s furniture ’n’
things, soon there won’t be nothin’ at all
to go back for repairs.”

“Horseless Horseman”: Recently the
skeleton of a whale was located near the
old Murray River shipping port of
Morgan (S.A.). Last week a whale’s
vertebra, which was found at river-level
beside a cliff at Loxton, was sent to the
Adelaide Museum. B. C. Cotton, of the
museum staff, has estimated that the am-
phibian swam round 12 million years ago
when the Lower Murray V&lley was part
of a marine gulf. According to that
noted zoologist, the late Dudley Le
Souef, a seal was caught in the Edwards
River last century at Canargo (N.S.W.) —
stuffed, it adorned the walls of the little
pub bar for years. There have also been
other authentic records of furry swim-
mers in the Murray River system, giving
rise to the belief that one of these ani-
mals, marooned in a billabong, has been
the origin of Binghi’s bunyip. If seals
once navigated the big river, surely it
would not be fallacy to suggest that
every couple of thousand years or so a
whale might have found its' way into the
lower reaches of the Murray. Two of
these mammals visited the Port Adelaide
“ You've forgotten the salt."
River last month, and only a steamer
coming downstream prevented two more
exploring the Yarra.

“Buckwheat”: There was white dust
thick on his old black coat, and he limped
as he came down the dusty road. As he
pulled up opposite my seat by the road-
side there was a quiet weariness about
him that spoke-of poor handouts and
rough sleeping-places. He sat down grate-
fully in the shadow of the cool green
wattles and began to examine his bruised
foot. Eagerly he drank the water that I
brought from under the big white bridge.
As I gave him the crust I had been sav-
ing for my horse I asked him to stay a
few hours and share my dinner. Im-
patient for the road, however, he declined
my offer, and, getting to his feet, pushed
off in the direction of the township; but
the few words with a friendly stranger
had put a new jauntiness into the limp of
the game old battler. At the white bridge
he stopped to look back, his red tongue
hanging out, his pricked kelpie ears out-
lined against the glare of the road, his
long tail, broken in the middle, gently
brushing the white dust.

“Old Sweat”: How that pumpkin-seed
came to be* just beneath the skin of the
abdomen of “Bamekaw’s” fowl (B,
4/8/’4B) is no mystery. Dressing a
chicken one day I came on an obstruction
almost entirely extending through one
wing. Dissection revealed a complete
head of wild .wheat. Evidently the bird
had picked it up and bolted it whole, and
the half-inch of hard sharp stem
at the bottom of the ear had pierced
the skin of the crop, after which crop-
movement gradually worked the whole
ear up along the skin of the shoulder into
the wing. Obviously the pumpkin-seed
did the same—worked its way out through
the bird’s crop by way of a perforation
which later healed and then, loose under
the skin where it couldn’t be digested,
gradually travelled. Dressing ducks
bought from a yard where building
operations had been carried on, I found
gizzards bristling like the back of a por-
cupine with Ijrin. nails which the ducks
had swallowed. The nails had pierced
the walls of the gizzard, being then held
by the head. The birds were in good
condition, apparently none the worse for
the strange fodder.
* * * *
“Curate’s Egg”: In his dissertation on
octopus-cooking (B. 11/8/’4B) “Nor’-
west” omits a detail which Torres Strait
Binghi deems an essential in the pre-pot
treatment of the cephalopod. This is the
bursting of the suction-sacs lining the
tentacles. Binghi holds that these con-
tain a poisonous secretion which must
be spilled by macerating the tentacles be-
fore the ’pus is potted. Japs in the pre-
war shelling fleets of the Strait, also
partial to octopus, invariably boiled a
shilling-piece with the rubbery viand,
claiming on a basis either scientific or
superstitious that the silver neutralised
the noxious secretion of the suction-sacs.
* * * *
“Challenger”: Mention in these pages
of late of “vagrant” ocean currents re-
minds that only recently the globe wit-
nessed something of the kind. From ages
unknown the powerful Humboldt
current has swept up the Pacific coast of
South America, bringing a cold stream
from the Antarctic to temper the heat
of a torrid coast. With this stream, year
by year, came myriad shoals of all kinds
of fish, but most notably the tiny
anchovy; food for the countless cor-
morants that homed on the long string of
islands off that coast and depositing there
a wealth of guano. However, in 1940 the
Humboldt suddenly veered away from the
coast, carrying with it coolness and the
fish shoals. Deprived of food, the sea-
birds also left. Recently the current has
swung back again, bringing back the
birds and the fish, clearly marking the
resumption of its age-old course. Why it
should have turned vagrant for several
years and then resumed the straight and
narrow path is beyond even the specu-
lations of science.
* * * *
“River Road”; “Bughouse’s” explana-
tion of the pulverising action of water-
pressure on sunken ships (B. 4/8/’4B) is
interesting in view of the almost com-
plete absence of wreckage from the
Koombana, lost without trace off the
nor’-west W.A. coast in 1912. A cabin-
door and a bathroom grating were found
and officially recognised. The approximate
area of the tragedy was known, and some
wreckage, even some lifeboats, should
have surfaced. Yet, though the locality
was searched for weeks by every lugger,
schooner and steamer on the coast, noth-
ing that could be definitely identified
came to light. Some purely circumstan-
tial evidence was found. A Port Hed-
land resident named Leach had collected
a huge pile of empty bottles, which he
packed and dispatched to Fremantle on
the Koombana. “Leach’s Fortune” was
“Giving a bit too much weight away, aren't you, mate?"
well known, and when some pearlers
sighted a patch of straw envelopes in
which bottles had been packed about 80
miles out from Hedland they assumed
that they had found the Koombana’s
resting-place. The evidence, however,
was never officially recognised. In the
absence of any other theory, my guess is
that the ship sank into one of the swift
underwater currents that abound in those
waters, to be sucked, perhaps, down into
the Antarctic, there to be pulverised at
leisure by Nature’s inflexible forces.
* * * .
“Aperist”: The reason why “Kelms”
(B. 4/8/’4B) hasn’t been able to find a
single hive of native bees in the W.A.
south-west is the Miller moth, a night-
flying insect-horror designed by nature
for the destruction of beehives. Against
this moth—there are two varieties, one
large, one small—the Old World bee has
its very competent sting. Thus, with a
strong hive of, say, Italians, it is very
difficult for the moth to carry out an in-
vasion. But against such an intruder the
stingless native bee was quite helpless.
Although not strikingly obvious to com-
mon observation, these moths are very
plentiful—so much so that comb, even
that containing only a trace of honey,
will, if left around after being taken from
a hive, speedily become infested. The
operation of these moths is to lay in the
comb eggs which hatch out numerous
voracious grubs which, tunnelling
through the comb, turn it disgustingly
black. More, these moths have a trick
of covering the face of an infected comb
with web which —bees being particularly
susceptible to entanglement—forms an
outer fortification against attack. So with
all these advantages in favor of the enemy
it is little wonder that the helpless native
bee succumbed.
* * * *
“H.H.”: Mention of oyster-catchers on
rockbound Cliffy Island near Wilson’s
Promontory (B. 4/8/’4B) recalls that
these members of the plover family are
masters at distracting attention from their
young. Walking along a King Island
(Bass Strait) beach last spring I came
on two of the all-black variety uttering
their usual loud piping call of alarm, and
as I approached one began rolling over
and tumbling on its back as though in
acute pain. I made after it —in vain. Next
day when, in the same spot, a bird put
on an act like a fowl with its head
chopped off and escaped me by toppling
into the surf, I woke up. Later I sneaked
on the pair to find them with two downy
chicks. As the youngsters ran for a
granite-rock outcrop near by a parent
bird crashed with a loud flop and lay as
if dead not 10ft. away. How it didn’t
kill itself I don’t know, but it was suffi-
cient to take my eye off the fledglings
while they escaped in the rocks. Inci-
dentally, these “red-bills,” as they are
known in the strait, only frequent odd
spots along the Victorian coast.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Years ago, when I
was a newcomer to these pages, I wrote
classifying jarrah as a softwood —and
raised a howl .from incensed wood-
butchers who had grown prematurely old
wrestling with the timber in its sawn
state. At the time I’d come down to
Perth fresh from a series of lucrative
victories over the salmon-gums and
white-gums of the wheatbelt, and I ac-
cepted the challenge that .the words
“jarrah” and “karri” hurl in the teeth of
all Westralian axemen. I spat on my
hands, flexed my muscles, gazed a
moment on the sizeable jarrah, studied
the “fall” and swung the Plumb. I
nearly dropped, and gained a good six
inches in chest expansion, when the blade
sank almost out of sight. By the time I’d
dropped that tree I was making fortunes
out of jarrah-clearing at £25 an acre —the
best I ever got in the wheatbelt was
325. 6d., and it had to be big stuff to pay
that. That stuff *was soft, all right, after
the slow-growing wheatbelt trees, but I
didn’t take on clearing it. The blokes
who owned the land wanted it grubbed,
and I wouldn’t swing a mattock. It all
came back to me the other day when I
built a shed of secondhand jarrah. I
broke half a dozen nail-bits and bent 90
p.c. of my nails. So I’m prepared to ad-
mit that those carpenter-critics had
something. But I’d still welcome an
attempt to commercialise the wheatbelt
timbers. I’d like to see a wood-butcher
trying to drive nails through seasoned
wodgil,
* * * *
“Shamuseen”: Dumb creatures gener-
ally may freeze into immobility on the
approach of danger because of confidence
in their protective camouflage, but I’d
like “The 0.D.” (B. 11/8/’4B) to explain
the action of one winged beaslie in N.Q.
This is a species of grasshopper whose
wings are exact replicas of the leaves of
the shrubs on which he usually feeds,
even the veins and serrated edges being
faithfully reproduced. However, the
insect prefers a diet of white mosquito
curtain, against which background he is
highly conspicuous. Yet, when danger, in
the person of the irate owner of the
ruined mosquito-net, approaches, he
stands stock-still, a manoeuvre which is
as suicidal as his original abandonment
of a natural leafy menu.

“Mat’s Mate”: “I’m in Birchip one
time,” Mat said, “lookin’ for Bill lesson,
who used t’ run the mail over t’ Charlton.
Bill was a bit deaf, but I didn’t know it.
I sight him ahead o’ me in the street an’
sing out, ‘Hey, Bill! Bill lesson!’ He
don’t hear me, so I go after him, singin’
out louder. Still he don’t hear, an’ I
think he’s havin’ me on, so I yell out.
A lot o’ goats o’ young blokes hangin’
round all start yellin,’ too. Strike me, in a
minute there’s such a mob all howlin’
Bill lesson that he looks round, sees the
crowd all yellin’ at him, stares at ’em for
a minute, then takes t’ his scrapers. He
must ha’ got the wind up. The mob
laughed, but I had t’ go all the way to the
far end o’ the town t’ find him. Y’ never
catch me yellin’ out at anyone now,”
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: My old convict
who wouldn’t exchange his goldmine for
a pardon may not have been as foolish
as “Old Camp” suggests (B. 28/7/’4B) —
assuming that he was aware of the offer.
Some of those old lifers had all the
liberty they needed, with the added
security that their position carried. In
bond, they were assured of free board
and lodgings. Free, they’d have been
forced to earn them, and there were
harder taskmasters than the Law, W.A.
in those days was a hard place, and there
were any number of men, completely
ignorant and without any reason to ex-
pect justice, who would resolutely refuse
to divulge such a secret. “Old Camp”
is sceptical about any find earlier than
that at Mugakine in 1887 ; but it would
be remarkable if traces of gold had not
been discovered within a few years of
settlement. W.A. reeks with gold—not
always in payable quantities—and it could
easily have been stumbled upon. The
Mugakine nugget, which was the first
officially recognised find in the State, was
found during dam-sinking operations.
The locality, which is now a prosperous
wheatfarming area, hasn’t produced an-
other speck.
THE SWALLOWS’ INVITATION.
Listen, pale man
With ink in your brain,
To our delight
As we call again.
By trees of summer
Beside bright water
What do debits
And credits matter?
Come, come along,
Ere innocence fades
To the hill we know
Where the stream cascades.
There far from these walls
We’ll wing and dart
Without any warning
Right into your heart.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
CATTLE AT BRISBANE.
The Beef Show
“Taurus”: Too many bulls
with weak backs spoilt an other-
wise excellent Hereford section
at Brisbane Show. Entries
totalled 185 head (more than
double that of any other breed)
from 37 exhibitors, representing
leading studs of northern N. S.
Wales, Darling Downs, the Bur-
nett and Gladstone districts.
Queensland studs submitted a
better lot of stock, better pre-
sented, than ever before.
Major awards, however, went
to N.S.W. breeders, the senior
bull championship to , Mc-
Ilrath’s 1948 Sydney junior
champion, Windsor Bachelor, by
the 1944 Sydney champion,
Windsor Lancaster. Bachelor
won the class 21-24 months and
is a promising sire with grand
lines and magnificent fleshing.
Only for his back. Hays Bros.’
Bexley Resolute, winner of the
18-21-months, class, might have
turned the tables, as this good-
headed son of Sugwas Dandy
(imp.) greatly impressed the
judge, J. Sparkes, of Dalby, who
gave Resolute the reserve
honors.
The King and a million of his
subjects will probably see both
bulls at next Sydney show, when
Herefords will be judged by an
English breeder, C. H. Morris.
Colly Creek Culture (by Golf
Hill Call Boy) \vas a decisive
junior champion, and reserve
junior was E. E. D. White’s
Woodlands Musket, a thick son
of Golf Hill Vulcan, a trifle too
dark for some critics. Both
bulls were subsequently bought
for North Queensland at four
figures. The Woodlands' Here-
fords were particularly well
shown.
Champion cow was Wilson
and McDouall’s Calliope Gaz-
elle Bth, one of the best
handlers on the ground, a
daughter of 1600gns. Colly Creek
Electric. The Sydney junior
champion, Turee Fancy, was re-
serve. Ennisview Cherry Ripe
60th, one of , the best heifers E.
R. Reynolds has shown, took
the junior female championship.
Another sire’s progeny stakes
prize went to A. E. Cobcroft’s
Windsor David. Both bulls in
this group later made four figures
at the sales.
Polled Herefords were below
the quality seen at Sydney show.
Bull championship went to
Comptroller-General of Prisons’
Lyndley George, but entries
from the C.Q. stud of E. W.
McCamley dominated most of
the male classes. With Eulogie
Hector (junior champion) he was
able to defeat the second-highest
priced Polled Hereford at last
Sydney sales, Milton Democrat
3rd. S. A. Plant was successful
with females, his Trevanna Cori-
sande 4th taking the champion-
ship, but the sire’s progeny
stakes went to Eulogie stock, by
Milton Nestor, for the third year
in succession.
The judge was so disappointed
with the condition of the
Devons shown that he declined
to award any championships.
F. J. Graham, of Bongongo,
Adjungbilly (N.S.W.), stepped
off a plane on his way back
from a round trip through
Central and Northern Australia
to judge the Aberdeens. The
high quality of the cattle made
the eyes of northerners fairly
boggle. Colonel H. F. White’s
1947 champion. Wallah Ottawa,
successfully defended his title
against the best that nine N.S.W.
and Queensland studs could
parade, despite having been
heavily used. Junior champion
was H. G. Munro’s Booroo-
mooka Regal, winner 15-18-
months class, and a son of
Booroomooka Hector, who also
sired the champion cow, Booroo-
mooka Noon, Brisbane cham-
pion of 1946. She defeated
Bald Blair Bent, Brisbane cham-
pion of 1947. Romance,
daughter of the champion cow,
and got by the 1946 champion,
Ossian, won the junior cham-
pionship, and in her class downed
Colonel White’s imported Estoril
of Murdostoun, reputed to
be the best heifer procurable
in Scotland and a truly remark-
able specimen of the breed.
Donald Dowding, of Goondi-
windi, whose daughter Rae pre-
pared the team, was conspicu-
ously successful in the younger
classes and groups.
Poll Shorthorns were a
triumph for the Queensland
breeder, A, Langmore, whose
champion bull, Prospect Baritone
(P.), was one of the outstanding
exhibits on the ground.** Lang-
more also showed the junior
champion bull, Prospect Model
2nd (P.), the reserve senior
female champion and sire’s
progeny and groups. The sight-
less Old Digger J. T. Scrym-
geour had the champion cow,
Netherby Matchless Miss, who
holds Sydney honors.
In one of the strongest Short-
horn sections for many years
prizes fell thick and fast on H.
C. and J. C. Taylor’s team from
Harrow, Cambooya. Their im-
ported sire, Tarvas Mandarin,
was unbeatable, and, as though
to confound those who criticise
showing, they won the junior
championship with one of his
sons, Turanville Liberate, Woo-
margama, with the best team it
has sent north of the border,
made a good impression and
won a fair share of prizemoney,
but the Taylor Bros, were too
strong and won group as well as
individual prizes.
Fat Cattle
“Killer”: With an entry of
541 head and a ban on stall-
feeding, the show made history.
Some of the exhibits should not
have been there, and too much
emphasis in judging was placed
on weight, but the general
“ Where do you think you're
going? Get back at the
end of the queue!”
standard was most encouraging
for the future of the beef in-
dustry in the North.
Champion pen of six was a
perfectly-matched draft of de-
horned Herefords, No. s’s, by
Lyndley bulls and topped up on
crops, from W. J. Bidstrup,
Grasslands, Warra. Their aver-
age liveweight was 16381 b., and
at the subsequent sales the
Queensland Meat Export Co.
paid £47 a head for them. C. J.
Bidstrup, son of the breeder of
the champion pen, won the
championship for single bullock
with a Hereford whose live-
weight was 16751 b. It brought
£55.
Reserve champion pen and
reserve single champion were
Poll Shorthorns from Arthur
Langmore, Prospect, Jondaryan,.
who had only nine head to pick
from. The pen of three were
23 months old, average weight
12041 b. They made £3l each.
The reserve single champion was
35 months old, weighed 14941 b.,
and realised £4O.
J. Sparkes, Lyndley, Dalby,
had 80 head in various classes
and won the pasture-fed section
of the Australian Meat Board’s
competition for three steers or
bullocks judged alive and
dressed. The pasture- and/or
crop-fed competition was won
by W. D. M. Thompson, Knap-
dale, Jondaryan, with He re-
fords topped off on crop; they
cut up into ideal beef.
Stud Beef Sales
“Sale-O”: The sales were the
liveliest Brisbane has witnessed.
A total of 251 head changed
hands for over £52,000. The
average was approximately
200gns. per head. Shorthorns
jumped 50 p.c. on the previous
year, with top price and top
average to H. C. and J. C.
Taylor, whose white Turanville
Lictor, c 3/5/’47, by Coonong
Marshall, made 550gns. Poll
Shorthorns did not reveal the
growing interest there actually
is in the breed. The top figure
was 300gns., paid for E. L.
Killen’s Antrim Guinea Stamp,
c 28/6/’46, and Gundibri Estate
Co.’s Gundibri Angus 14th, c
27/8/’46.
In Aberdeen-Angus N. L.
Forster’s first-prize bull in the
12-15-months class, and reserve
junior champion (Abington
Dewar) topped the A.A. sales at
320gns., at which figure he went
to Terrica Station, Inglewood.
Polled Herefords sold to
230gns. for E. W. McCamley’s
Eulogie Trooper, c 23/3/’47.
Herefords were more sensational,
though the market was not
greatly in advance of last year.
The junior champion. Colly
Creek Culture, made UOOgns,,
top price for all breeds. The
reserve bull brought lOOOgns.
Both go to N.Q., which can be
interpreted as a sign of renewed
confidence in the future of the
beef industry and of British
breeds .in the tropical north,
where zebus are spreading. A.
E. Cobcroft, Herbert Park,
Armidale, sold two four-figure
bulls—Herbert Park Escort,
third prize in the class 2-years
or over, to J. Sparkes, at
1050gns., and Herbert Park
Eclipse, first prize in the same
class, to the Wrights, of Bland-
ford, at lOOOgns. The average
for 112 Herefords was 240gns.,
which compares with 87 Here-
fords averaging 178gns. in 1947.
The Dairy Breeds
“Melba”: A record showing
of Jerseys and Illawarras may
signalise a of Queens-
land dairying. Illawarras made
as fine a display as the breed
has staged in this country. It
was miles ahead of the Sydney
display and is a strong argument
for preliminary inspection of
exhibits to ensure that they come
somewhere near Royal Show 7
standard. The class of aged
milkers was a grand sight.
J. Phillips and Son were the
most successful exhibitors. They
showed the ’champion bull
(Sunny View Kitchener), bred
the reserve champion bull (Sunny
View Evelyn’s Masterpiece), and
won both champion and reserve

Jersey entries were a record,
but standards suffered by the
presence of too many young
cattle brought solely for sale.
The inspection committee should
put away its kid gloves. Cham-
pion and reserve cows came
from the aged dry class, and are
noted producers. The former is

Carolyn, who headed the section
in 1945, and the latter W. Spres-
ser and Sons’ Carnation Peer’s
Lass. Rush Princess (imp.), who
has founded a great family for
the Sinnamons, could only get
to fourth place, while Brookland
Cunning Drop, who holds a
Queensland production record
with 7521 b. of fat, was unplaced,
although later she won the type-
and-production class.
Bulls were interesting because
of the presence of two Jersey
Island bulls and a New Zea-
lander, . Wallace Bishop’s Navua
Victorious Samaritan took the
championship and Tom Pethe-
rick’s Regal Design, imported
recently at a cost of 700gns.,
was reserve. Trecarne Some
Duke won the special prize for
the bull judged for type and
conformation and with points
for official production of dam
and three daughters; this bull
also won for sire and progeny
group and sire’s progeny stakes.
A Fodder Contest.
“Jbnhean”: Sydney R.A.S.
has just concluded its annual
conserved - fodder champion-
ships, and once more the ques-
tion of their value is worth con-
sidering. The idea behind them
is sound enough: An effort by
the R.A.S. to inspire and en-
courage farmers and graziers to
store fodder by showing them
what can be done and what
benefits, both individually and
nationally, lie in fodder conser-
vation. For that the society is
to be commended.
The trouble is not so much
with the idea of the competitions
as with the fodders that are
eligible and the scale of points.

NINETY BULL CALVES MARKED.
Messrs. Adams, of Weerite, Vic., write:—
“Last Season, I marked 90 bull calves
with your Elastrator. At weaning time,
these were carefully inspected and every-
thing appeared to be in order. The thing
that surprised me more than anything,
was that they ivere in good condition
with fat cods. The actual operation was
very simple and next season toe intend
to use “Elastrator” again as it saves
much time and mess. We averaged a
calf every 3 minutes, Elastration, ear
mark, and branding,”

In their present form the com-
petitions do not necessarily put
emphasis on genuine conserva-
tion but merely “spotlight” a
property that has conserved
fodder. For instance, under
present conditions there is noth-
ing to stop a farmer chaffing his
fodder and selling it a few hours
after the R.A.S. judge has in-
spected it. Which defeats the
whole object.
Fodders eligible are: concen-
trates (including all grains), or
roughage, as silage or hay {e.g.,
lucerne, oaten, wheaten, clover,
grass) and any other fodder
suitable for conservation, to
have been produced on the land
owned, leased or held on shares
by the competitor. From this
list it will be seen that the
greatest fodder in existence,
natural-growing grass, is ex-
cluded. Grass can be conserved
while it is growing, and it
should have a part in any con.-
servation scheme. One of the
best farmers in Australians Sir
Frederick McMaster, of Dal-
keith, Cassilis. His property, in
all seasons, is a joy to see, yet
he never wins a championship,
though he enters year after year.
The area of Dalkeith, compared
with the total of his conserved
fodder, beats him, though he has
some of the best pastures in the
State, conserves them and there-
fore finds it unnecessary to store
vast amounts of fodder.
McMaster practises “reserve
stocking,” which means that his
pastures are always excellent and
usually superb. On his 36,000
acres run 14,000 Merinos and
1500 Herefords, Counting one
beast to six sheep in grazing, this
equals 23,000 sheep to 36,000
acres in sheep -to - the - acre
country. Thus Dalkeith always
has about one-third of its pas-
tures resting and in reserve. The
pastures, thanks to this, were so
high and thick last summer that
grasshoppers could not rise to
fly when they got into the pad-
docks.
The thoughtless might remark
that McMaster is rich enough to
afford it. The reply is that re-
serve stocking has saved Dal-
keith in drought-time again and
again.
Plainly, McMaster’s system is
one that should be widely
described and emulated and
means found to encourage others
to follow it, with variations ac-
cording to soil and climate. The
R.A.S. could well ponder the
matter, since it knows that the
problem is not so much the
amount of fodder stored as the
necessity for it. If our pastures
were not being ruined by over-
stocking it is doubtful whether
fodder conservation wotild be
necessary at all. In another
way: Care for the pastures and
the fodder can look after itself.
Firebreaks.
“Will C.”: There is no better
break than a freshly-burned zone
around the farm. How wide the
zone should be may be decided
by the height and dryness of the
grass and the terrain itself, A
break about 20 yards wide
should be ample where the grass
is not above 3ft. in height, but
allow about 50yds. where it is
6ft. high or more.
Blady-grass burns more
fiercely, than either spear- or
wiregrass, and extra care should
be taken where it predominates.
Pay heed to the terrain when
burning the break. A fire ap-
proaches much more rapidly
across a flat plain than across
hilly land; on flats, breaks
should be pretty wide. This is
especially true where the flat
has no non-inflammable trees to
break the force of the wind. If
your place is at the foot of a
range the fire will burn slowly
downhill against the wind and
be stopped by a minor break.
But you’ll need a good wide
break if your place is on a hill
up which the fire may be driven
by the wind.
Post-natal Paralysis.
“Agamemnon”: More cows
are being affected both in Aus-
tralia and N.Z. The disease is
distinct from milk-fever, but may
occur with it. The cause is not
definitely known, but may be
associated with a low blood
sugar. Injection of calcium and
magnesium has no effect unless
milk-fever is present.
Affected animals go down
shortly after calving, and in un-
complicated cases appear bright
in the eye; appetite is good.
Recovery may occur spon-
taneously, but many have to be
destroyed. Treatment 'with in-
jections of two ounces of glu-
cose as a 10 p.c. solution into
the jugular-vein is usually effec-
tive, or where this cannot be
done fair results may be ob-
tained by drenching with dilute
molasses three times daily.
Improved feeding with a grain
supplement before and after
calving tends to prevent the con-
dition. Where milk-fever treat-
ment does not lead to quick re-
covery it is advisable to try the
glucose injection.
Hints for the Farm. ,
“Bon Accord”: A friend who
runs a sheep property of about
750 acres here in W.A. won’t
have a dog on the place. Says
they frighten the sheep and that
this affects the wool. Elderly,
he has no outside help, but
trains two or three sheep to fol-
low him everywhere. Then, when
changing paddocks, he lets them
go in the mob and calls on them
to follow him. The natural in-
clination of the mob does the
rest. Anyway, he gets top price
for his wool.
“Metax”; When pouring
liquids from bottles always
pour away from the label and
thereby save drips running down
and causing defacement and de-
tachment. This is ancient prac-
tice among chemists, but is even
more necessary under the more
exposed conditions of farm
usage.
“Ben Acre”: The smoothing
of a concrete floor with metal
will cause it to be slippery when
wet. Concrete that is to be
walked on should be smoothed
with wood, or, for a perfect non-
slip surface, gently run a little
water and drag a bag over it
before it is properly set.
“Myrr”: Peachleaf-curl (not
curly-leaf) is caused by a fungus
carried over from the previous
season in the leaf-buds. An in-
fected tree is characterised by
lumpy, bronzed, unsightly leaves.
At pink-bud stage (5 to 10 p.c.
blossom) drench the tree with
Bordeaux, 6:4:40. Curly-leaf,
due to aphis, is best controlled
by a tar-distillate ovicide spray
in the dormant winter months,
but, as it’s too late to kill the
eggs now, thoroughly spray with
nicotine sulphate, loz. in 6gal.
of water.

Discussing in Washington the
case of the Soviet schoolteacher
Mrs. Kosenkina, the Soviet
Ambassador, M. Panyushkin,
said her fall from the window
of the Soviet Consulate in New
York was a deliberate con-
spiracy on the part of the Fascist
warmongers of the U.S. State
Department to discredit the only
country passionately working for
peace—Soviet Russia.
The facts were these. Mrs.
Kosenkina, after having been
bravely rescued by M. Lomakin
from Trotskyite gunmen prob-
ably in the secret employ of the
U.S. Government, implored the
Soviet Consul-General to
arrange for her early return to
her beloved Fatherland and the
wide freedom she would enjoy
there. Obviously she was un-
able any longer to tolerate the
atmosphere of slavery which was
so prominent a feature of
present-day America.
After happily talking of her
coming interview with the
N.K.V.D. in Moscow and the
eagerness with which she antici-
pated occupying a comfortable
barbed-wire bedroom in one of
the Joy Through Strength holi-
days at a Siberian winter resort
which had been arranged for her
as a reward for her work while
in the U.S.A., Mrs. Kosenkina
had expressed an urgent desire
to get another look at a par-
ticular carnation growing in the
backyard of a house several
streets away and which she had
admired. The better to view it,
she had requested two of the
Consulate’s secret police to hold
her by her shoelaces as she hung
head-down outside the window.
Each of them obligingly took
a firm grip. Had they been
high-class Russian shoelaces no
harm could possibly have be-
fallen her. However, they were
American shoelaces, shoddy as
could be expected of a product of
a capitalistic autocracy, More-
over, it is suspected that they
were deliberately frayed before
being sold to Mrs. Kosenkina on
orders of State Department
spies in anticipation of just such
a situation as arose, so that when
she fell it would give the vile
American press an opportunity
to make the ridiculous and
damaging > charge that either she
fell or was pushed out.
The Soviet Consul-General,
M. Lomakin, said in New
York that after he had braved
singlehandedly a storm o f
bullets from over a hundred
anti-Stalinist gunmen to rescue
Mrs. Kosenkina she was radi-
antly happy at the Consulate.
When told she would be sent
back to Russia she had actually
“Just one more, chaps, then I'll have to scoot."
cried with joy. The crudities of
life in the U.S.A. had greatly
saddened her, and this oppor-
tunity to get back once more to
the up-to-date amenities of her
Fatherland, with its bright car-
bide lamps, its collectivised
droshkies, the mud streets so
deliciously soft on the feet, the
street watersellers, the beautiful
communal monthly baths and the
latest galvanised-iron fuel stoves,
filled her with unspeakable joy.
Over a samovar erudite dis-
cussion had turned on the Law
of Gravity, which, of course, had
been discovered by a Russian
scientist long before Newton,
In particular the theory of Pro-
fessor Nuttz, the famous Soviet
physicist, that under the true or
Stalinist Law of Gravity objects
fell not down, but up, was
touched on, and Mrs. Kosen-
kina, who is a great admirer of
the professor, expressed her in-
tention of trying out his theory.
With this end in view she sent
two of the Consular staff up on
to the roof to catch her as she
floated up. Two of the secret
police at her request assisted
her at the window with her ex-
periment. Unfortunately the
professor’s theory, though not
wrong basically, was proven not
exactly right.
In a sensational article entitled
“Plot of Fascist Offal,” Mos-
cow’s “Depravda” discloses that,
in a desperate attempt to pre-
vent Mrs. Kosenkina returning
to the U.S.S.R. with the know-
ledge of the appalling poverty
being suffered by the American
masses, who are forced to work
a 64-hour week for as low as
five dollars, and of the race-riots
which are sweeping the mid-west,
the U.S. State Department en-
listed the remainders of the
gangs of A 1 Capone, “Legs”
Diamond and Baby-face Nelson.
These thugs, disguised in stolen
uniforms of the Soviet Consul-
ate’s torture squad, obtained
entry past four lots of heavily-
armed bodyguards, seized Mrs.
Kosenkina as she was being
invested by the Consul-General
and his aides with the Most Ex-
alted Order of the Twisted
Neck wire (First Class) and
hurled her through the window.
Before more Soviet guards
could be summoned the mis-
creants escaped by crawling
through a gas-main.
According to “Red Star,”
organ of the Red Army, after
being bravely rescued by M.
Lomakin, who carried only a
walking-stick, from two bat-
talions of White Russian
Fascists who were using Sher-
man tanks, Mrs. Kosenkina was
in a gay mood at the Consulate.
After having a game of Russian
roulette with the staff, during
which two assistant-military
attaches blew what represented
their brains out, Mrs.
Kosenkina, to prove that Soviet
athletes were immeasurably
superior to those of the effete
democracies who have just
finished the democratic spy-ring
known as the Olympic Games,
made*an attempt on the hop-
step-and-jump record. Unfor-
tunately her jump was so mag-
nificent she went straight through
the window, and, counting the
drop to the courtyard, she
achieved 87ft. 9iin. This is be-
ing claimed by the Soviet as a
world’s record.

The Snowy Water
The latest investigation of whether
the waters of the Snowy River should
be diverted to the Murray or the
Murrumbidgee is developing along char-
acteristic lines — i.e., it is becoming a
State v. State issue with Victoria naturally
favoring the Murray and New South
Wales, not quite so naturally, the Mur-
rumbidgee. Profound arguments have
been adduced in favor of each plan, but
the unfortunate fact is that both plans
have highly commendable features. The
difficulty is that there’s not enough water
for both.
If anything cried aloud for national
control, it is the diversion and harnessing
of the scanty water-resources of this
country. All over the continent there
are water-development plans the
Clarence Gorge project in northern
N.S.W,. the Bradfield proposal for divert-
ing the tropical rains of northern Queens-
land inwards, the raising of the wall of
the Hume Weir at Albury, which does
not necessarily depend on the Snowy
diversion. But in a country crying aloud
for water —except in the brief periods of
mockery when it cries out against too
much of it —the intrusion of Common-
wealth-State conflicts, of State v. State
jealousies, and of the fell hand of the
office-bound planner holds them all up.
The answer is to create a water-control
' authority with power tq make decisions
and give effect to them. America’s T.V.A.
overlapped States States just as
stupid, conservative and jealous As ours.
But T.V.A. went ahead and, because it
had the power to turn plans into reality,
the vast project it undertook rates as the
greatest piece of water-engineering in
history.
The absurdity in our case is, of course,
that the Murray River is a political
boundary—a dividing instead of a uni-
fying point. It is ridiculous to declare
that there is any fundamental difference
between the Murray and the ’Bidgee;
they are, in fact, two major units of a
single river-system which extends to the
Lachlan, the Darling, and to Victorian
rivers like the Campaspe flowing into the
Murray. The thing would be to develop
this river-system to the common good of
all the people embraced in its large and
varied area, in a way which would con-
tribute most to the prosperity of Aus-
tralia and of a larger population.
If the Murray River Commission had
the powers of T.V.A., this larger purpose
could become the goal, instead of the
adequate use of insufficient water being
the central fact in a slightly squalid argu-
ment.
How about a referendum on setting up
a commission with adequate power? Its
sheer realism might stun the people into a
“Yes” vote. — Dee (N.S.W.).
The Vanishing Abo.
“H.H.” (B. 28/7/’4B> says the natives
are an ill-used dying race who must be
isolated in some remote area for their
protection. This, however, presupposes
the aboriginal in his wild state is happy,
free and well fed. Actually, the lot of
natural man is the opposite.
The extinction of our native race is
inevitable, but not in the way commonly
supposed. The abos. are vanishing to
our cities by a long and circuitous route,
beginning at the missions, which don’t
merely teach him to sing:
A sunbeam, a sunbeam! I’ll be a sun-
beam ....
Missions are practical places where
Uinghi learns to ride and to work stock,
to read and to write. He gets the ele-
mentary equipment to stand on his feet
in a white man’s world. On the great
cattle-stations to which he goes both boss
and ringer give him a fair deal, and he
&oon feels that there is a place for him
in the scheme of things. If he casts his
eye on a halfcaste girl, say, at Anthony’s
Lagoon, it is to be expected. The pro-
duct of that union will be a “yella fella,”
a designation without malice.
This “yella fella” may end up in a
place like Winton, or Cloncurry, or even
Lmngreach, following almost any class of
'Work. Here he may marry a quadroon,
Or even a white. His kids usually do well
at school. I know one with a dis-
tinguished service record doing a Rehab.
Course at a university. The halfcaste
Community has increased in recent years,
and in far-western towns a dash of color
is not much of a barrier. People are
G&ually accepted on their merits.
The abo. isn’t dominant stock. He
breeds out rapidly and doesn’t throw
back. Thus he is vanishing in a manner
not to be deplored.— Dusty Mile (Q.).
The Individual
After the 1914-18 war many soldiers
went into business on a co-operative
basis, believing it to be the first step to-
wards Utopia. Most of the schemes col-
lapsed, or finished up in a modified form
of private enterprise. Undaunted by
history many soldiers from the later war
also embarked on co-operative schemes,
only to meet the same fate.
I was interested in such a group of 16
thoughtful young men. While serving
they formed a detailed plan for a co-
operative cotton farm. By the time they
were ready to launch it after the war, five
had drifted back to other occupations
and would not change them. That was
all right because anyone not firm in his
convictions was liable to be a handicap
to the co-op.
The second trial came when there were
not enough funds to buy land, the cotton
market was seen to be insecure, and the
“ C'mon —pull into the side there!"
necessary machinery could not be
obtained. Four more participants fell
out.
The remaining seven took up a piece
of undeveloped land from which they in-
tended to produce vegetables, eggs and
dressed poultry, for sale to the near-by
holiday resort. Most of the ground
turned out to be unsuitable for gardening,
and two more members retired.
Five men and three wives then decided
to concentrate on poultry. But first
money had to be used to provide indi-
vidual cooking and laundry facilities, as
the communal arrangements were un-
happy.
Throughout the whole period income
was barely meeting expenditure, and that
threw a further strain on the partnership.
Finally a meeting was called and amid a
general airing of views two other members
resigned. Possibly the remaining three
will be able to carry on.
What kills all these dreams of Shangn-
la is the personal element. No matter
how efficient a man is, he is not a
machine. As long as fear, doubt, envy,
likes and dislikes build up a personality
man must remain an individual and not
a uniform tooth on a sprocket-wheel.

Basic-wage Rise
Don’t plan too confidently how to
spend your basic-wage rise of four shil-
lings, because tax deductions are going to
mulct you of anything up to 31 \ per cent,
of it. It is largely a matter of luck how
much you will lose. The official schedule
of weekly instalment deductions, by
which employers must abide, is based on
even half-crown rises in pay, and the
rigidity of these steps leads to anomalies.
In the lower-wage groups only the tax
of employees without dependants is much
affected by the 4s. rise. An employee
whose wages rise from £6 to £6 4s. has
his tax raised from 12s. to 13s. (25 per
cent, of his four bob). But if he is already
earning £6 Is. and goes to £6 ss. his tax
increases a mere 6d. from 12s. 6d. to 13s.
The chap on £lO a week is unlucky.
If single his present deduction is 28s. 9d.;
on £lO 4s. it will be 30s. 3d. If he is
married with two children the tax rises
from 11s. to 12s, 6d. (Is. 6d. in both
cases, or per cent, of 45.). But if he
is now on £lO Is. and goes to £lO ss.
the relevant deductions are 295. 6d. to
30s. 3d, and 11s. 9d. to 12s. 6d. (18| per
cent.), or 9d. in each case. Oddly enough,
the married man with three dependants
whose pay rises from £l3 Is. to £l3 ss.
loses only 6d., the deductions being
255. 9d. and 265. 3d.
All haywire, especially when the four-
shillings rise is supposed to be essential
to meet the increased cost of living.—
Hist (N.S.W.).
New States
Should New England become a
seventh State, there is every reason for
an eighth State consisting of that part of
the N.S.W. South Coast south of the
railway’s end to the Victorian border,
and extending westward to include
Southern Monaro and possibly part of
the Riverina and even that part of Vic-
toria from the N.S.W. border to the
Snowy River.
Twofold Bay
would be the port,
busy with its own ex-
port trade, fishing,
fish-canning, timber,
newsprint and min-
ing industries. These
have not been de-
veloped because this
s.-e. corner of N.S.W.
is a forgotten land as
far as the Govern-
ment is concerned. It
is not considered
worthy of a railway
or even a decent
shipping service.
Ben Boyd had the
right idea about this
part of the country
a century ago, and it
needs a modern Ben
Boyd to revive all
the things he
planned.
This eighth State
would settle the
Snowy River busi-
ness, which has been
revived and forgotten
a dozen times in the
last quarter of a
century. The new
State would contain
the whole of the
Snowy River from
its source to its
mouth, and the most
remote farmer would
have his electric
light, refrigerator
and all the other
conveniences t o
make life in the
country more attractive —independent of
the coalminers. 4
The eighth State would include Mt.
Kosciusko. There would be new towns
in the snow area, new and bigger hotels
and guest-houses for the tourists who
would flock there, not by train from
Sydney, but by sea to Twofold Bay and
then direct to the snowlands by fast road
transport or a new railway connecting
Twofold Bay with Southern Monaro,
Gippsland and the Riverina.
Farms could double production, there
would be a ready market and thousands
of immigrants would be attracted to the
area. It would carry 10 times its present
population.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
If the Warrumbungle range is to be
the western boundary of the New Eng-
land State, as envisaged by “K.A.S.” (B.
21/7/’4B), then as a central-wester 1
object to the foundling (semi-arid n.-w.
corner of N.S.W.) being left on our door-
step. It is only fair that all States —
existing and future —should include a
proportion of our low-rainfall territory.
New England’s southern boundary should
extend to the South Australian border.
Soil on the Western Plains is very
fertile and needs only water to make it
as productive as the Tweed. North Coast
floodwaters, which cause millions of
pounds damage, should be diverted
through, or pumped over the mountains
into the’ Barwon’s upper tributaries. A
century of hard work is needed to de-
velop the rich Darling valley. New
Englanders should be prepared to accept
their share of the responsibility.
There is no need for “K.A.S.” to think
the western baby would make the New
England State too unwieldy, for it is
quite on the cards that once the infant
reached maturity and became self-sup-
porting it, too, would seek to break
away from Armidale. —K. Me. (N.S.W.).
Lawlessness
In the city proper, Elizabeth-street,
Sydney, is a pleasant dignified thorough-
fare beginning at Hunter-street just up
the hill from the “S. M. Herald” offices
and a few yards down from police head-
quarters. It is busy with trams,
taxis, business - people, an occasional
barrister in wig and gown and theatre
crowds going freely about their lawful
business and pleasure.
At least that is the general scene. A
few nights ago, however —on a Saturday
evening at 6.25 p.m. to be precise—the
general traffic included four people, two
middle-aged married couples, the
husbands walking together about 30 yards
in front of their wives. They were be-
tween Hunter-street and Martin-place,
almost in the shadow of the Taxation
Department and the Rural Bank and only
a few yards from police h.q., when three
or four thugs set upon the two women.
One of them “made advances” to one
of the women and “used filthy language.”
“She pushed him away, and the man
suddenly smacked her face and kicked
her in the stomach.” When the other
woman tried to help her “her eye was
blackened and she was knocked down
and kicked.”
One of the husbands walking ahead
looked round and ran back, closely fol-
lowed by his companion, who
saw my wife lying on the ground near a
post and my friend’s wife in a car-parking
lot. My friend sailed in and as I neared
he went down and they started to lay in
the boot. Two of them set on me when
I got there, and 1 was punched from both
sides. I went down and was kicked in the
back. When the men ran away I saw
that blood was pouring from my wife’s
nose and head and covered her blouse.
Both my friends were also bleeding badly
and in pain.
The four victims of the frightful affair
were taken to Sydney Hospital where the
man who “sailed in”—a sft. Bin. Digger —
had to have a wound in his head sewn
with five stitches. The other man was
badly cut and bruised about the face.
One of the women, who had to have two
stitches in her head, was also suffering
from a blackened eye, broken teeth and
a possible fractured jaw. The other
woman was cut about the face and had
her ribs broken or bruised. When this
was written the police were still looking
for the thugs.
Sydney has had a shameful record of
this sort of thing in recent years, and the
only remarkable features of this one
are the savagery and brazen audacity
with which it was perpetrated in the
heart of the city. There is, of course,
only one treatment for it —the lash and
jail sentences as heavy as the law allows.
Respect for the law —the first essential of
a civilised community—is an inevitable
casualty of war and post-war years, and
that respect will not be restored until the
present Government or its successor
shows thugs, killers, blackmarketeers
and the criminal considerably less toler-
ance than they have lately been shown. —
P. D. (N.S.W.),
Root of the Matter
A New Zealand doctor named Charles
Burns told the Royal Society over there
that “free medicine” had encouraged the
public to rely on the contents of a bottle,
even for mental, moral and psychological
disorders. “As a result New Zealand is
flooded with millions of gallons of colored
fluids which, it is claimed, will cure any-
thing.” Anything, that is, except the
effects of Socialism. —S. C. (M.L.).
Dedman, piloting the Coal Industry
Bill through House of Reps, in July,
1946: —
Between 1942 and 1945 permitted con-
sumption of coal exceeded production by
1,700,000 tons. After one experience of
this kind the Government is determined
that never again must the industry be
permitted to lapse into the position in
which we found it Today we are con-
fronted with a dangerously low level of
coal-stocks and an ever-growing de-
mand The function of this bill is to
establish a Joint Coal Board with all the
powers necessary to ensure a regular pro-
duction of coal Its duties will be, first,
to ensure that coal shall be produced....
to meet requirements throughout Australia
and in trade with other countries Just
how drastic and far-reaching the board’s
measures will be will depend solely on
what is necessary to get the coal we want.
That was two years ago. Nothing was
said about Ashley and the “fixing” game
which has intervened every time to block
the board’s “measures” whenever they
looked like being “drastic.”—F. C.
(N.S.W.).
On June 30, 1939, when Menzies .was
Attorney-General, he had a staff of 454.
On March 31, 1948, after six and a half
years of Dr. Evatt, the number had grown
to 1221. And expenditure increased by up-
wards of £lOO,OO0 — i.e., from £465,700 to
£575,200—in a twelvemonth, 1947-48. H*?-
may be “a dear kind doctor,” but he’s a
dashed expensive one. —B. S. (S.A.).
