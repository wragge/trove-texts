TEN BOOKS OF VERSE
The chief attractions of T. Inglis
Moore’s Bayonet and Grass (Angus
and Robertson) are its freshness and
vigor. There is a note of adventure in
it, coming partly from the war-poems
and travel-poems—“Star Drill” in a
military camp, a Solomon Islander
proudly decorating himself with
“apricot ears,” a “blossoming jeep”
in Japan, fireflies in the Philippines—
and partly from a similarly active
approach to Autralian city and country,
as in the “Leschenaultia” he has dedi-
cated to Katharine Susannah Prichard:
You are the lover of life where the
sap
Ascends in the karri giants, flows
Through the hot leaves to the magnet
sun,
And leaps in Red’s strong pulse as
he goes
To his mate, while the birds in
singing bright
Channel the summer to streams of
delight.
The verse itself, to fit with scene and
thought, is similarly vigorous; but not
so successfully. Generally it is
cumbrous. Inglis Moore takes a good
idea for a poem, a clear line or two
embodying the idea, and then so over-
loads it with learning, with develop-
ment and elaboration and with often
inappropriate imagery that the verse
goes flat and the original conception is
smothered. He is best when he is
simplest, as in some of the war-poems
and, especially, that beautiful love-
lyric, “Comrade-in-Arms”: —
Lithe of limbs and fine of heart,
Thoroughbred in every part,
So you win, by double grace,
Flesh and mind to your embrace.
Cool broad brow and pool-brown
eyes
Guard your gentleness, and wise
Innocence whose zest
No day undews
It may be said, too, of Inglis Moore
that, despite some technical borrow-
ings from Brennan and FitzGerald,
he is an individualist; following no
particular school of movement but
hammering out his own problems for
himself; and the same is true of
Laurence Collinson, whose The Moods
of Love (Overland) contains some of
the most searching love-poetry written
in this country since Kenneth
Mackenzie’s “The Moonlit Doorway.”
Collinson writes unevenly (“I’m not
another of those poets whose” is hardly
an auspicious first line for a sonnet),
but he can make art like Ray Mathew
of the seemingly artless lyric:—
What’s it like to be a blossom
bursting
to the sun and the beehum sky the
very first time?
That’s what I feel I feel like, darling ;
that’s the reason for this rhyme;
he makes a courageous attempt to say
something new in the Shakspearian
sonnet form: —
I’m not another otf those poets
whose
syllables of adoration clang
conceitedly, hyperbole on the loose,
adjectives of love that bang bang
bang.
My metaphors are not exaggerated,
not even when I claim I’m land in
drought,
desert dust, a human dehydrated,
until you storm me and my green
breaks out;
he can be equally impressive about
Miss Peggy Sagar, the first movement
of the Sibelius Violin Concerto, and a
cigarette-butt; and if one might not
agree with the ultimate tendency of his
sociological poems, it remains pleasing
to meet the Melbourne scene so
accurately and feelingly described: —
I often see the aged rich
on promenade about the church
that honors John, evangelist,
on Toorak’s green and pleasant
perch.
Nancy Cato (The Dancing Bough)
and Mary Finnin (The Shield of Place),
whose books have both been published
by Angus and Robertson, walk in more
familiar poetic territory. Both are
trying to make an Australian mythology
out of the pioneers, in the manner
brought to perfection by Judith Wright;
and both are concerned with the Aus-
tralian landscape.
But, just as it is a mistake to date
all voyager-poems from Kenneth
Slessor’s “Captain Cook,” as so many
Australian critics do —there were
dozens of voyager-poems written from
the earliest days of Australian poetry,
only Slessor brought the theme to its
peak—so it would be a mistake to
grant Judith Wright exclusive property
in the pioneers. If the general theme
was stated most memorably in
“Bullocky.” “Brothers and Sisters” and
“South of My Days” (as it was stated
years earlier in Mary Gilmore’s “The
Shepherd”) there is still a value in the
particular local variations which Nancy
Cato finds in her “Mallee Farmer” and
her “Cato of Hobart Town,” and
which Mary Finnin finds in “Sarah
Lorton, with her death about her,”
or in
White-curtain Irish with their ritual
ways—
Old colonists they were, and named
O’Neill.
Nancy Cato and Mary Finnin are,
in fact, what are called “regional”
poets; and, distilling the life and
landscape of a particular region, each
contributes a new patch of.the enduring
earth to Australian poetry and to our
awareness of this continent. Mary
Finnin (in her curious, distinctive style,
more satisfying in lines and stanzas
than in the complete poems) brings
us sheep-country and snow-country: —
Down from the summit of Feather-
top pours the white smother ;
and Nancy Cato’s country (set down, as
is her thought, with increased force in
this new book) is South Australian
vineyards and outback, where
... .parrots shaped like small green
fish
Dart in swift shoals above the
blacksoil plains,
Their voices silver-shrill, their
shadows falling
On saltbush and belah.
Other recent books of verse include
A Book of South Australian Verse
(Mary Martin Bookshop), a creditable
collection put together by R. H.
Morrison; Fire on the Earth (Devon-
shire Press, Sydney), by John Dawes,
an ambitious set of narrative-poems on
Australian explorers in a plain, blank-
verse style which, though too jerky
and admonitory, has considerable
strength; The Swagless Swaggie (Aus-
tralasian Book Society), a selection of
the best of Edward Harrington’s
admirable bush-ballads; Cantos of
Wandering (Beacon Hill Press, Sydney),
by Francis Brabazon, and Poems of
Life and Time (Elizabethan Press), by
George Frazer, both amateurish; and
(Edipus Verse (Elizabethan Press), by
John Podger, a slight and patchy
collection with some engaging touches
of Dylan Thomas (“Hoo there my
ghosty girl!”) and a hint of promise.
Steele Rudd
In his review of Sandy’s Selection
(R.P. 15/l/’5B) Douglas Stewart refers
to W. E. Fitz Henry’s statement that
Rudd’s character Dad was “drawn
from three actual people.” Stewart
questions if Dad, “except as a straw-
man, a buffoon, really existed as a
character.”
Well, I shan’t quarrel with his
opinion of Rudd’s ability to create
character, although I lament that Cecil
Mann’s theory that the author’s illus-
trators called the character-tune is
again aired, with Stewart’s approval,
when it can be so easily smashed by
reference to Rudd’s letters to Stephens.
For instance, the original cover-
design for “Sandy’s Selection” infuri-
ated Rudd. To Stephens (2/11/’O4) he
wrote: “The drawing is simply hideous
Uncle looks like an opium-
soddened cow gone stark-staring mad.”
Sandy was all wrong. “He should be

CHANGING UNIONISM
SOME trade-unions in Australia have
become totalitarian, infected with a
great conceit and under the impression
that anybody, Government or other-
wise, who tries.»to thwart their designs
is committing a sort of sacrilege. Other
unions have lately become more
reasonable.
It is noticeable that those who prate
about freedom and who are the most
ardent supporters of Dr. Evatt and his
fight for “British liberties” are the ones
who also are most ready to crush
liberty when it does not suit their books.
In the main, these unions are led by
members of the Communist Party
Central Committee and their offsiders,
whose views are wholly totalitarian
and who regard themselves as part of
the theoretic Communist Government
of the world, not yet de facto, 'but a
sort of Ho Chih-minh or Mao rebel-
body as those bodies existed before
they achieved power in their respective
areas.
With such status they enforce their
wills whenever they can, with or with-
out the help of the law. When the law
can be used they are all on the side of
British justice, and when it cannot —
to hell with the law! The only law,
in fact, that they recognise is what
they themselves make or adopt in their
arbitrary way.
Some of the manifestations of their
doings are the regular stoppages on
the wharves for thg most trivial causes,
and the manner in which absenteeism is
condoned and encouraged by the
leaders who feel that every stroke of
work not done represents a blow for
chaos and Communism. The arbitrary
manner in which the Seamen’s Union,
headed by Mr. Elliott V. Elliott—the
man who was in the police-cells with
£1125 inside his shirt—has made
its outrageous demands on buyers of
Australian ships in compensation for
their not employing Australian crews
to take their purchases away is another
instance.
And there has been a notable one in
Tasmania, where two Democratic
Labor men who have asserted their
undoubted right to support the politi-
cal party of their choice (and not to
support opponents) have been physi-
cally barred from the jobs (at which
they are legally entitled to* work). The
fact that the Federal Communist
leadership of the union is ready to
destroy the livelihood of two men who
will not subscribe to the funds of Dr.
Evatt’s A.L.P. speaks for itself.
The Tasmanian case also illustrates
the servile manner in which Labor
Governments have come to kotow to
these people whom they sometimes
condemn, tongue in cheek. Mr. Aylett,
the Minister who controls the police
in Tasmania, says that his force does
not interfere with what amounts to
mob intimidation, interference with the
undoubted personal right of movement
of the victims, and even technical
assault, because it is a union dispute —
an admission on his part that he
believes that there is one law for the
union-leader and another for the
ordinary unprivileged citizen.
More examples of the same sort of
thing can be found operating the length
and breadth of Australia through the
A.C.T.U. (which blows hot and cold
on the Red issues), the Queensland
Trades and Labor Council and the
actions of various Labor Governments
and authorities.
This is all of a piece with general
Labor policy—with the policy of Dr.
Evatt, who, when he knew that Labor
would be defeated in the Federal
sphere, produced proportional-
representation as a method whereby the
Senate would be stalemated.
It is of a piece with the recent action
of the Labor majority in the
Sydney City Council, which intro-
duced proportional-representation and
abolished the ward system for its own
party purposes and proposes to
reverse the position again for its
advantage now that its own device is
working against it.
Fortunately there is a brighter side
to the picture. In spite of the clamor
of Red agitation, its illegalities,
brutalities and subversion of the plat-.
form of the Labor party, which for
practical purposes has ceased to operate
under the mangling hands of the
Chamberlain-Evatt-Cahill „ juntas, a
welcome change is coming over Aus-
tralian unionism and labor. It is
evident in the industrial peace, pros-
perity and employment which are at a
peak in unions which have shed the
Communist leadership through court-
controlled ballots and otherwise in the
past few years and in the gradual dis-
appearance of the union-bolstered
Labor Governments.
One merely has to look at the metal
industries in general, in which, despite
the belligerence of some diehard
unions, relationships are generally
conducted on a fair-fighting basis of
hard negotiation; at the Ironworkers’
bodies in particular; and at, more
particularly, the coal-industry, in which
the Communists have been beaten back
to the wall.
There are still both bad union-
leaders and bad colliery-proprietors in
sections of the coal-industry, but,
generally, the picture is one which is
most heartening, more especially since
the present phase is one of transition,
in which mechanisation has been
introduced on a large scale, unemploy-
ment has been caused temporarily in
the process of changeover, and there
are still Red groups playing politics
and Socialism, sometimes forcing on
the unions as a whole policies such as
that which threatened—in a time of
surplus labor—to debar employees
from working in the Joint Coal Board
mines if those mines were sold to
private enterprise.
The Miners’ Federation is still mili-
tant, as it ought to be. But it has in
practice, if not in theory, suspended
the class-war in its dealings with the
coalowners and has accepted terms
such as incentive-payments, which the
Communists would have resisted with
the general-strike weapon and wide-
spread chaos in industry in and outside
the coalfields when they held the
power to do it. The result is higher
coal-production, greater industrial
peace and bigger earnings for the
workers in most mines.
The boom in the heavy industries,
the record production of coal and
metal products, the vast expansions of
the B.H.P. and other companies, the
amenities installed in coalfield towns
under the influence of the Joint Coal
Board and the general prosperity of
Australia are all in a great degree due
to the ousting of Communist control
from the headships of some big key
unions.
In the outstanding ones the Com-
munists have either been compelled to
mute their tune, or are, as among the
seamen and wharflaborers, operating a
scorched-earth policy. They would
sooner wreck the industries than give
up the last bastions of Communist
influence. And the industries they
control are in contrasting depression
and decline to those from which the
Reds have been ousted.
The Communist party has now only
one ambition and one chance of survival
as an influence in Australia: the return
of a Federal Labor Government at
Canberra at the next elections, more
especially as it seems that the present
Labor Government in N. S. Wales, its
reputation spotted more than the hide
of an unwashed Dalmatian, is also on
its way out.


THE EARBASHER


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Croak! Croak! Croak!"
It would have been easy to prophesy the
method which Dr. Evatt would adopt in
opening the Parramatta by - election
campaign for his henchman Mr. Mahony.
He is one of the firmest adherents to
the panic-method. If he can get on to
something calculated to stampede the
electors irrespective of the harm it does
to the economy and to the workers, he
will exploit it for all it is worth —which
normally is not much.
Thus six years ago he was to be heard
denouncing the Commonwealth s “horror
Budget” which he believed would destroy
standards of living, wreck the 40-hour
week, produce a depression similar to that
of 1929-31 —unless, of course, he was
returned to power at the next election.
None of his prophecies came true. In
fact, as is usual, the results of them
ran to opposites, and instead of the dire
catastrophe which, he predicted Australia
found itself caught up in a boom.
Dr. Evatt has often since filled the role
of prophet and of planner, and the results
have never been impressive.
The keynote of his Parramatta speech
last week was: “We want full employ-
ment restored,” he at the same time giving
an impression of catastrophe because
26,000 people in a population of 10-
million are temporarily “on the dole” at
a time when the country is oppressed with
the aftermath of a year of drought and
of weak export-markets.
His speech sounded rather similar to
the Communist party’s plan as set out in
its letter to the Prime Minister the week
before. The Corns, asked that the banks
should make extensive loans for the pro-
vision of work ; Dr. Evatt says that the
Commonwealth Bank could provide the
finance for development-work to absorb
the unemployed. The Communists argued
for a substantial reduction in the defence
budget, which “is beyond Australia’s
needs” and “is falsely based on the
Government’s adherence to the Dulles
foreign policy, which emphasises prepara-
tion for war instead of negotiation for
peace.”
A week later Dr. Evatt says that Aus-
tralia has had “precious little for its
defence programme in the last six years”
and, by inference, that defence expendi-
ture is waste of money and that “one of
the greatest contributions Australia could
make is to help bring about stable peace
on sound terms throughout the world.”
He implies that the Western nations are
not acting in good faith, and fails to
outline the culminations to his own
efforts as head of the United Nations.
He should be the last man to talk about
what any Australian Government could
do in the promotion of world peace apart
from the fact that he must be aware that
it does not need a further conference to
prove what he says a Summit meeting
would prove whether or not the
Russians are “bluffing.” It has been
proved often enough already.
The whole Labor movement, while
moaning about unemployment, is through-
out Australia developing a political
campaign, tongue in cheek, for substantial
wage-increases. In Brisbane the Metal
Trades Federation Conference plumped
a few days ago for marginal increases in
metal industries of from £3 15s. to £6 6s.
a week for tradesmen and pro rata
increases for skilled and semi-skilled
workers. The N.S.W. Labor Council,
obviously for election purposes in prepara-
tion for the Parramatta campaign and
for Mr. Cahill’s last stand, has begun a
fight for “maximum activity to defend
jobs.” Its argot is Communist.
Its solution of the unemployment
crisis was in a resolution put forward by
R. A. King, M.L.C., who says it lies in
shortening the working-week so that more
men could be employed to do the same
amount of work and that the wage be
increased at the same time and the dole
rate doubled.
Nobody said anything about the fall in
the wool-cheque, in meat, butter and other
exports, particularly wheat, and the
reduction in prices for Australian
products overseas.
None of these factors has any appeal
to either the political side of the trade-
union Labor movement or to the Federal
Labor party. They are not concerned
with the basic necessities of preventing
unemployment or facing the economic
situation.
They are concerned mainly with pro-
ducing a fairy-tale which will attract the
unthinking voter. And, in doing so, they
are following the line most likely also
to appeal to the well-financed Com-
munist-led unions on which they depend
very largely for their funds in these days.
Moslem Instability
The Moslem ferment grows almost every
day, and the atmosphere as it affects the
rest of the world is illustrated by Nasser’s
noisy speech on the consummation of the
union between Syria and Egypt, which
have nothing in common historically or
geographically.
He says that “the new republic is a
great weapon with which we will be able
to face the common enemy who launched
a direct attack on us when he struck at
Port Said .... He won’t be able to fight
us again.”
It is not clear whether the “common
enemy” was the British and French
forces or the Israelis, but in any case
Nasser is somewhat under a delusion.
He is not attackable just now because
two great opposing nations which are
striving for control of the oil and water
in his part of the world are ready for the
time being to let his antics ride rather
than risk getting into holts with each
other. But there is a point beyond which
his polemics are not likely to be allowed
to go.
He has learnt that he has nothing to
fear from U.N., at which no doubt he
laughs, and he feels that he can now
snap his fingers at the British Common-
wealth. But his stab at armed aggression
against Sudan has pointed the way to his
fate. He is determined to get control
of all Nile waters and seems to have
made an attempt to seize Upper Sudan,
but has found that the Sudanese are
prepared to face him on his own ground.
Meanwhile, he is stirring-up as much
trouble in Africa as possible through
incitement and mouthing about Arab
freedom and unity, while imposing a rule
of force on the populations of Egypt
and by decree, with scarcely even
the shadow of democratic structure.
The voting for unity of Egypt-Syria
at the plebiscite, representing less than
a quarter of the total of the combined
populations, showed 99.99 per cent, for
unity in Egypt and 99.98 per cent, in
Syria. There seem to have been no
informal votes. Cairo should be renamed
Moscow.
At the other end of the new Moslem
world, Indonesia, Australia’s nearest
neighbor, is, according to Soekarno, in a
state of war. The central Soekarno Gov-
ernment with its military forces and
resources has now been firmly repudiated
by the so-called rebels of Sumatra and
other areas ,which produce the wealth
on which tne metropolitan hordes of
Communist-infiltrated Javanese subsist.
The issue is almost entirely the expulsion
of Communist elements from the Govern-
ment and the dismissal of the fellow-
traveller Prime Minister Dr. Djuanda,
and his replacement by Dr. Hatta.
Dr. Hatta is reported to be backing
Soekarno, in whose hands he is. Already
North Celebes areas which have been
virtually in the hands of rebel Govern-
ments all along and the capital of the
rebel forces in Sumatra (Padang) have
been bombed, but it remains to be seen
what resources the central Government
has and where they are coming from.
It would not be surprising to find
numerous ardent Chinese peasants
suddenly moved to walk across the China
Sea and miraculously form-up into fully
armed divisions, on the principle of
Korea, if Soekarno is in real danger, as
he must be if Sumatran and Celebes
products are denied the central Govern-
ment.
At present only one thing is certain:
Indonesia is chaos.
Who Bosses the A.C.T.U.?
In announcing its decision to withdraw
from the Federal Ministry of Labor
Advisory Council the A.C.T.U. did not
give much evidence of clear thinking. It
said that
(1) The time had come for a bold
political front to be presented to the Federal
Government to secure the return of Labor
at the next election.
(2) The Federal Government had failed
to take adequate steps to deal with
unemployment and housing.
(3) The work of the council was not
such that brought direct material benefit
to the trade-union movement.
Minister for Labor Holt has described
the move as a retrograde step, and a
retrograde step it is. It puts the clock
back to the election campaign of 1949,
when Left-wing industrial leaders were


urging, with considerable support from
some Labor politicians, that in the event
of the Chifley Government being defeated
at the polls the trade-union movement
should refuse to co-operate in any way
with the incoming Government. Such a
policy would have meant sabotaging the
work of a Government elected by the
majority of the people and would have
been a negation of the democracy in
which the A.L.P. has always claimed to
believe —and which in its saner moments,
when it doesn’t allow itself to be hood-
winked by undemocratic Left-wing
extremists, it does believe.
For most of the Menzies’s Govern-
ment’s term of office the A.C.T.U. has
managed to compromise with its
extremists and has followed the policy
that even though you don’t love a Gov-
ernment’s politics you can still co-operate
with it for the mutual good of your
members and the country.
President Albert Monk has gone on
record several times as to the value of
the Labor Advisory Council, but now r ,
it appears, the whole thing has been a
waste of time ; it has “brought no direct
material benefit to the trade-union
movement.”
Voting on the motion, according to
reports, was pretty even —nine to seven —
so apparently almost half the represen-
tatives still think the experiment is worth
continuing. The scales have obviously
been turned by the recent Left-wing gains
on the executive of the A.C.T.U. In
particular, the influence of Waterside
Workers Communist boss Jim Healy can
be seen. Albert Monk may still be presi-
dent, but the Left-wing is in control.
A.C.T.U. policy on immigration makes
nonsense of everything Monk has said
in the past few years, and this latest
decision treats him with contempt.
No Civil Defence?
[From “Stromlo”]
Although Parliamentarians and others
are going through the impressive courses
at Mt. Macedon (Vic.) and various people
are in official positions designated as
related to “civil defence,” there is, in
fact, no real attempt being made to intro-
duce measures which would be genuinely
effective if the horrible need arose.
There are two aspects of the problem.
One is the safeguarding of the civil
population, and the other is the protec-
tion of industry and the services which
are essential to large civilised communi-
ties. It is surely about time the Federal
Government came out from behind its
smokescreen of words on the subject
(most of them produced several years ago
and well out of date by now) and really
took the people into its confidence.
Can anyone in Canberra say, now,
whether any form of civil defence would
be effective against the kind of weapons
that any enemy, even in a “fringe” war,
would use against our cities and their
interlinked defence and civilian instal-
lations? If honesty on the subject
prevailed, would it be said that the idea
is hopeless?
It seems that no country in the world
is really prepared to shift all its industrial
centres into inaccessible spots or
possibly that every nation now recognises
that no spots on the face of the globe
are inaccessible to the kind of missiles,
the type of TV carried by satellites, the
nerve-gas bombs, which are now far past
the drawing-board and the factory-
production stages.
If we have to acknowledge privately
that there are no defences for civilians,
then let us say so openly. No one in
Australia is going to panic in conse-
quence. The inference is plain that if
we can’t be shielded from all the latest
devices, neither can any of the ordinary
and probably peace-loving civilian com-
munities in the countries which may find
themselves led into war against us.
Is the peace going to be kept by mass-
terror or by mass-indifference on war’s
effects on civilians? It seems rather
doubtful.
A.L.P.C.P.
Moves, which did not remain under-
cover for long, since both parties have a
long record of political understandings,
aimed at unseating Bolte at the forth-
coming Victorian elections and making
possible either an A.L.P. or C.P. Govern-
ment with the support of one or the
other, have been agreed to in recent
weeks.
The situation is not unlike that which
preceded the betrayal of Sir Stanley
Argyle by the C.P. before the war and
resulted in a C.P. Government, supported
by the A.L.P., which rapidly proceeded
to pass all the Labor legislation the
A.L.P. could never have introduced
successfully into Parliament; but an
important difference is that Bolte has
been forewarned and knows the C.P.
form.
A.L.P. preferences will be given firstly
to the C.P., secondly to the D.L.P., and
lastly to the Liberals. This will mean
directions to Labor voters in C.P. seats
it is not contesting to vote C.P., a move
aimed at preventing the Liberals taking
any C.P. seats ; in the few C.P. seats the
A.L.P. is contesting preferences will be
given to the sitting member.
No reciprocity at the election is
practical politically from the Country
party, since any open alliance with
Labor would alienate a substantial core
of steady C.P. supporters; the pay-off
will come after the election if the
campaign succeeds.
The C.P. and the Liberals will
exchange preferences, at least officially,
and the Liberals also are likely to
receive D.L.P. preferences, which will be
important in some seats. The D.L.P. is
not making any promises of its prefer-
ences, but its speakers are muttering
angrily that its preferences cannot be
expected by a party which at industrial
elections links-up with the Communists.
Comrade Elliott
The story of the arrest of Elliott V.
Elliott, a leading Communist and
dictator of the Seamen’s Union, as it is
unfolding, makes an interesting com-
mentary on the type of unionism run by
people like Mr. Elliott.
The essential fact is that nobody in
the circle of the Seamen’s Union or the
Communist party appears to feel that
there is anything unusual in the secretary
of a union (whose power is so great that
it has economically waterlogged Aus-
tralian coastal shipping and is in process
of doing worse) being arrested on a charge
of drunkenness and failing to defend the
charge or, when engaging in his social
occasions, carrying around £1125 in cash
inside his shirt.
The “Tribune,” official organ of the
Communist party, quotes a statement
from the “Seamen’s Journal” in which
Comrade Elliott is alleged to have said
that his “decision not to contest a charge
of being drunk, although independent
witnesses testify to his sobriety.... ‘was
not lightly made.’ ”
He was influenced by the fact that the
police “had tipped-off pressmen who
were waiting outside the court ‘and
another witch-hunt’ against the union was
on.”
From past knowledge, he said, “we
knew nothing to our advantage would
have been published by the press.”
Mr. Elliott’s stablemate who was
arrested with him, according to the
“Tribune,” declared that “between 5.30
and 9.25 p.m.” they had “five middies in
two hotels and a glass of bottled beer
at the home of seaman E. Sleight, who
confirms the story.”
The “Seamen’s Journal” made the com-
ment : —-
When arrested on February 7, Federal
secretary Elliott had in his possession
£1125 union money. This money had been
received from the Maritime Transport
Council in connection with the Bonalbo-
The payment was made to the Maritime
Transport Council before the A.C.T.U.
decision [on indemnity payments—Trib.]
Thus, according to the official journal
of the Seamen’s Union, Comrade Elliott,
as its general secretary, had a large sum
of money in cash paid to allow a vessel
sold out of Australia to proceed to the
home port of its new owners without an
Australian crew. Although the A.C.T.U.
professes to have set its face against this
sort of payment, it is still being levied in
other forms —for instance, ships which
are bought for the Australian trade
abroad are supposed, under the Elliott
ukase, to be brought to the Australian
coast by Australian crews which are sent
abroad with first-class air-fares paid,
lavish pay and a holiday to strengthen
them for the ordeal of the voyage home.


Wimbles Inks"
SYDNEY’S month's rain in 36 hours
relieved Royal Tour officials of
worry should the Queen Mother deviate
from the set path on her visit to the
N.S.W. Housing Commission settlement
at Villawood. When all hoses were
banned officials called on residents whose
homes fronted the Royal way. They not
only allowed, but begged, that gardens be
freely watered. Some sporting types did
turn their hoses across the back fence to
spray the veges. and flowers of neighbors
living in less-favorably situated streets:
thus, felt the parched ones, should Regal
patronage fall, like the gentle dew from
heaven. —“W.M.”

“1.H.P.”; Crowds still gather to watch
the towaway truck at work, and in
Castlereagh Street everyone from by-
standers to truck-driver, including two
cops on motorbikes who escorted the
procession, was grinning. The victim was
a taxi. I dunno why it seemed so funny,
but it made me laugh, too.
❖ ❖ ❖
“Maitri”: The sportsmistress at a
large Melbourne girls’ school was agitat-
ing for a couple of new tennis-courts.
“But why do you want any more?” she
was asked by the clergyman-principal (a
character right out of this world). “I
often watch the lassies playing and I’ve
never seen more than four of them on
our court at the same time.”

“N.”: When the hotel rouseabout
handing empty glasses back to the bar-
man remarked, “There’s a bodgie among

explained: “One is cracked on the top.”

“J.R.”: Having rattled over a good part
of the Queensland Railways under cattle-
truck conditions I’m irritated when people
slam the crack Sunlander running between
Brisbane and Cairns. The air-condition-
ing gives them colds, the closed windows
claustrophobia. It is not until one steps
from the refrigerated train on to scorch-
ing stations, or sees through plate-glass
gangs of fettlers streaming sweat, that one
appreciates both air-conditioning and
closed windows. Add spotless cleanliness,
carpeted floors (second-class, at that)
excellent meals in the dining-car at low
prices, and you have a train that no
Queenslander needs to blush for.

“Nitor”: Have just read that a group
of Queensland politicians' visiting the
Barrier Reef island resorts presented the
management of each with a silver water-
jug. From experience of these “tropic
island paradises” I’d say at first blush a
beer-mug would have been more appro-
priate, but on second thoughts a water-
jug would be more their size.
❖ ❖
“Pelga”: A friend showed me over
her house gutted by fire and wryly pointed
out the non-inflammable plaster sheeting
which had blazed merrily while nearby
pitch - pine panelling had merely
blackened. I contributed my own
experience of inanimate perversity—the
favorite glass vase that fell from a high
shelf on to a rubber ashtray: the
guaranteed - unbreakable ashtray was
smashed to bits, but the vase didn’t even
crack.
❖ ❖ ❖
“Pip Tok”: Returning late at night to
his surgery, a Port Hedland (W.A.)
doctor crashed into a door from which
the protruding point of a long screw ran
into his abdomen and severed a small
artery. The doctor walked about a hun-
dred yards back to the hospital, made the
incision which would enable him to tie-
up the artery and, despite passing-out
a couple of times, finished the job, sewed
up the incision, and walked home. Next
day he went about his work as usual,
with only a slight limp to remind him of
the experience.

“T.A.G.”: On a holiday back of
beyond some time ago I became good
cobbers with the limb of the law, and on
my wife’s assurance that she could drive
he obligingly issued her with a licence.
On return to the city I found I "had been
transferred to the Big Smoke. Sold my
car, and the first week my wife visited the
bank. Identification? “Oh, yes, I have a
driver’s licence” (proudly), “but I’ve left
it at home.” Then she came home and
complained bitterly that she had lost her
one and only opportunity to use her
driver’s licence.
“ Anyway , your flying might improve after you've had a hit of lunch."
DECISION-WEEK
“ ‘Decision Week,’ a campaign to invite
100,000 Manly-Warringah people tb refrain
from gambling for a week, was launched at a
public meeting.”
Heed, heed, my friend, the words I
speak,
And do not gamble for a week.
See how a lottery may be lost
As well this way, and at no cost;
The horse that bore your shirt, don’t
doubt it,
Can just as well be beat without it ;
And the event will prove how crackpot
Your system was to win the jackpot.
Don’t take a week, but take a year;
Study the stars and crystal sphere,
Observe mug-punters, how they fail,
Watch the embezzlers go to jail,
Read-up on form and pedigrees
And jockeys’ idiosyncrasies,
Until you feel you cannot make
Any ridiculous mistake:
Then you can plunge with all you save —
And think of what a bank you’ll have!

■pQR more than three years getting
A half-a-loaf of bread every second
day from the container outside my flat-
door each evening has been like diving
into a lucky-dip: wholemeal, malt, white,
brown, breadroils . . . I’ve never been
able to work out my baker’s system of
rotation. All I know is today’s half-loaf
will be different from the day-before-
yesterday’s. No note had ever passed
between us, and I had never seen him,
but a day off work this week gave me
the pleasure of his acquaintance. “No,
not that,” he said hastily when I reached
for a crusty-looking loaf; “you have
wholemeal today.” I had wholemeal.
“You know,” he remarked sympa-
thetically, “you must eat an awful lot
of stale bread. But don’t worry ; I’ll see
you at least get variety with it.” Now,
who says nobody takes a pride in their
job?—“Service.”

“Imperial 55”: She who will be 17 in a
week or so was languishing over her
typewriter, and one of the boys asked
her what was troubling her. She shrugged
her shoulders, sighed, and said, “I wish
I were 19 and engaged or something. It’s
terrible having all these boys hanging
round and it’d be so peaceful to be
settled.”

“T.A.G.”: Seen on a Commonwealth

up as high as £9750 . . . Private enterprise
is awakening to the field of the newly-
rich.

“Lorna Doone”: On the price of
fences, I remarked that our front fence
was down, and we were making-do with
some stacked stones, and agapanthus.
Another friend said “I do like a well-kept
lawn sloping away to the footpath, like
they have in America.” Another piped
up, “Yes, that would be lovely but not
the slightest bit of use for us. We must
have a fence, and a six-footer at that” —
then, with a giggle—“because we are great
ones for dashing out for the milk in a
nylon nightie!”

“0.G.”: A horn sounded, brakes
screeched. A Latvian woman dragged a

“you can get killed every day of the

die once is enough.”

“Pelham”: Round the barrel they
gather at the rowing-club, champion
WTestlers, pugilists, runners, but mostly
first-class oarsmen. This Sunday-morn-
ing the third round had just begun when
a gentle knock came on the front (slid-
ing) doors, and a shrill female voice
called “Tom! Do you know it’s nearly
one-o’clock?” Tom, 6ft. and 17st.,
showing the crowd some of his favorite
holds, and, dancing out of reach of an
imaginary opponent, quickly gulped his
beer and ran to the doors exclaiming,
“So I thought ‘Phooey to tradition; these flagstones get so cold.’”
“Yes, Alice, I’m coming right away,
dear.” The doors slid open disclosing
his wife, a neat little girl some Bst.

spoken word, wot?

“Nunk”: Invitation overheard to a
reluctant deep-sea fisherman: “Oh,

“Nimrod”: At our swimming-pool
rules of hygiene are rigid. Most impor-
tant is that bathers wash before entry.

little bloke, aged 3y, on leaving the pool
said in a clear and piping voice, “We
won’t have to have a bath tonight, will
we, Mum?”

“Alma”: Asked a Swede, when hitch-
hiking in that charming country, why it
was that they drove on the left, yet still
had the steering-wheel on that side
(B. 12/2/’5B). He grinned happily and
said it was because “All we Swedes are
naturally pig-headed.”

“Tom Trout”: One part of the Bene-
long Point Opera House we needn’t have
any fears of filling to world standards . . .
the stage. In the current season at Lon-
don’s Covent Garden two successive
operas, “The Carmelites” and “Rigoletto,”
have all the principal roles sung by Aus-
tralians, while at Sadler’s Wells (having a
brief but joyous flirt with operetta) the
Merry Widow turns out to be a vivacious
lady from Broken Hill
♦> »> ♦>
“Curio”: At school before the war
the annual Leaving Certificate notice from
the Department of Education invariably
contained a split infinitive: “Teachers are
requested to kindly fill ” and it was a
tradition that someone should mark it
out on the school notice-board copy. In
the eight years I was there it always
happened. Do the same notices still go
up for the same treatment?
♦♦♦ ♦♦♦
“Riquet”: Before Horseferry Road had
seen Diggers, Col. Ryan had been
christened “Gutzer Ryan,” a pseudonym
nearer than “Plevna” to “Old Opencut’s”
description (B. 5/2/’5B). But Ryan could
use the scalpel. A week after the Land-
ing the Mashobra troopship carried a
load of badly wounded to Alexandria.
En route we operated continuously,
working on mess-tables under light-
clusters rigged by the ship’s*, engineer.
The “theatre” had windows about


3ft. x 2ft., accessible to infantrymen on
board for general duties. The first case
had carried a sniper’s bullet in his
abdomen for three days. Eight faces
watched at each window until Ryan made
the first bold 6in. cut; then the faces
quickly disappeared, to be replaced by
eight others. As Ryan drew out intestines
foot by foot, sewing up eight punctures
in all, new faces took the place of those
who had seen enough, until finally the
windows were vacant, but the ship’s rail
was fully occupied. Col. Ryan pushed
back the 30ft. of repair, sewed up
the opening, and sighed. “Now he has
one chance in 100!” The chance dis-
appeared two days later.
❖ *:♦ ❖
“Eureka”: Friend spent hours of his
spare time making a letterbox, fixed it
many times in position on the front fence,
and just as many times removed it for
alterations. Finally he was satisfied ; the
family inspected it; a “wet-paint” sign
was chalked on the footpath; the post-
man was told that from now on this was
the letterbox ; and that night it was stolen.
“Bo”: Just as all doctors portrayed in
Hollywood opuses are required to be
bald or near-bald, wear rimless spectacles
and severe expressions, and must invari-
ably request copious quantities of hot
water, whether the patient is suffering
from a broken neck, gas-poisoning, bullet-
wounds or childbirth, so the celluloid
detective must never go detecting without
wearing a light-colored belted raincoat.
I’ve seen him wear it at 3 a.m. in night-
spots and in a heat-wave on the fringe
of the Nevada Desert; I’ve never seen it
raining when he has had it on. He’d much
“I think we've cracked something pretty big — Dr. Hamberger is
orbiting madly round the lab”
rather shed his gat than that coat. And I
suspect that those who take the roles are
such poor actors that they don’t know
what to do with their hands —and the
raincoat-pocket solves that problem with
beautiful ease.

“Doric”: “I think Teeny is going to be
a singer,” said her proud mother, as we
heard her carolling in the bathroom. All
of a sudden the trills were transformed
to a high scream, and a half-clad girl
rushed out. “There’s a man watching
me!” she said. It appears that, while
drying herself, she saw a pair of eyes
looking through the bathroom-window,
which was raised about half-an-inch and
opened into a passageway. The men of
the house went outside, but Peeping Tom
bad vanished. But I think that Mother s
hopes may be realised—no operatic diva
could do the change from gaiety to terror
better than Teeny did.

“Mugga Way”: German publications
are giving some prominence to a veteran
of the 1870-71 war against France, Franz
Grobauer, repatriated from Stettin, in
the Polish-administered portion of
Germany, to West Germany. Grobauer,
who is 108 years old, refused transport
from the station to the reception-camp,
and walked. Asked his recipe for a long
life, “No drink, no tobacco, no women,”
he said, obviously staggering questioners
so used to asking “how” that they had
never thought of asking “why.”

THROUGH locked doors and by
devious means the newsboy arrived
in the sanctum of the lodge-meet-
ing. Before the flabbergasted brethren
had recovered from the shock they had
each bought an evening paper. The lad
eyed the sumptuous spread, turned to
the W.M. and remarked “Gee, she’s
beaut.! How d’ya join?”—“Masonite.”
A DETERIORATING SPORT
“Eating in public used to be a pleasure when
restaurants were spacious and soft classical
music was played. Now it is a nightmare,
with cramped space, a line-up of patrons waiting
behind you and a noisy band playing awful
pop-tunes.” —Letter to Sydney daily.
You squeeze to a table
(That is, if you’re able —
For plump ones it’s really a pinch),
It’s quite a feat, eating ;
With chairs nearly meeting
You can’t move your elbows an inch.
While you’re savagely brooding
On spud that’s eluding
Your fork, patrons seething
Behind you and breathing
Right down your collar.
You feel you could holler,
But somehow you keep in the clinch,
And battle on grimly.
You view pretty dimly
The clucks of impatience you cop
From short-tempered matrons
(The worst of the patrons)
Who moan they are “ready to drop.”
The waitress is glaring,
The orchestra blaring;
You’re trodden on, hustled,
And damn’ near de-muscled
In harrowing struggle
With blunt knife to juggle
Subduing a case-hardened chop.
In days that were better
They never would fetter
The diner who loved to extend
His wings while he polished —
Off peas, or demolished
His fish. He’d no chair to defend.
Pop-tunes didn’t fray him.
Soft classics they’d play him:
Shrewd tactics employing,
They knew that enjoying
A Beethoven scherzo,
The bill wouldn’t hurt so,
Or steak that would break but not bend.

The Ace of Hocus Focus
[This macabre fantasy, written in
December, 1953, was McCrae’s last
contribution to The Bulletin.]
T IKE a drunken husband
trying to get into his house,
the wind tumbled from one
veranda - post to another,
shook the half-dozen windows,
or rolled from wall to wall.
Meanwhile, inside my bed-
room, I imagined all sorts of
things; when at once I saw, in
reality, a card inching its way
along the carpet from under-
neath the door. That it was
travelling directly towards my-
self became certain, because
each time I turned, or left, or
right, it did the same.
I stooped to hold out my
hand ; and the card, jumping
into it, lay down. I took it to
the light and saw it had black
edges ; moreover, instead of a
name in the middle it showed
an ominous date: ? ?
The wind still blew ; and the
card, slipping out of my grasp,
ran about the floor; then,
finally, up my trouser-leg, only
to be dislodged with difficulty.
Now, quite out of temper, I
carried it to the mantelpiece,
where I trapped it under the
metal frame of my mother-in-
law’s photograph . . . for safety
sake.
After that, to
compose myself, I
began to change the
position of pictures
on the wall ; but the
pictures resented
this ; and, if they had
been able to hoot,
would have hooted ;
indeed, one of them,
an ultra - modern
fellow, stuck a tack
into my finger while
I tried to alter his
out-of-plumb effect.
This startled me;
though not so much
as when, reaching for
my handkerchief, I
pulled out the black-
edged card instead!
I was certain now
that I dreamed ; and,
for ever in a rage,
tossed the damned
thing into my collar-
drawer ; then, with-
out buttoning up, gave myself
to the wind.
Next day, before breakfast,
I opened the drawer; and
there lay the card —my night-
mare—pretending to be asleep.
I snatched it up ... I cut it to
mincepaper ... I burnt it in
the fireplace ... I took the
ashes for a walk ; and, like a
wicked uncle, lost them in the
“thickest wood.”
Favorite Poems
[Here, in a letter in reply to a query
as to which of his poems could be
reproduced in a “Bulletin” jubilee-
number, is McCrae’s personal choice
of his favorite poems.]
In my shack I have a
cupboard 9ft. high, and among
them I’ve been
mountaineering since
six-o’clock this morn-
ing ; and now (at 7
p.m.) I have found
the piece that I had
lost ... a collection
made by Bertram
Stevens of my verse-
contributions to The
Bulletin, starting
from 1896 (my first
bantling in your
press), when I was
twenty years of age.
Some of these are
dated; others are not.
The three begin-
ners—“ Owner Going
West,” “The Gabo
Light,” “The Honey-
moon Trip” are
registered according to order ;
31/10/’96, 2/1 /’97, 31/12/’9B.
“Fairy Story,” one of the
few I like, was a “Red Pager,”
but Bert hasn’t given the day,
the month or the year. “Down
the Dim Years” is dateless, too.
“The Elysian Hunt Club
Meet” remains lively ; as does
“A Hunting Morn.” But, in
my opinion, “The Mouse” still
takes the cheese—
All Christmas night upon the
shelf
Among the apples yellow-
faced . . .
And so forth, and so forth.
De la Mare, enthusiastic.
Lionel Lindsay appreciated
“The Honeymoon Trip,”
especially the lines
There’s a star in the east like a
tomcat’s eye
Or a jewel in a rajah’s sword.
In its farewell one sentence
has been altered:
Goodbye ! Au revoir ! for
you’ll come back a-day,
Your breast to the lolloping
sea
With your wide-spread sails in
the family way
changed to
Till you swim the warm wave
of the green wide bay
In the peace of the long shore
lee.
The original words are more
related to the story. The new
ones have euphonism in a
greater degree.
Could send you Bertram’s
collection only for the fact that
the contents are hardly repre-
sentative.
Here’s my (at present) auto-
anthology :
I Blow My Pipes, Colum-
bine, Enigma, Calvia, O Deep
and Dewy Hour, Fantasy,
Satyr’s Lass, Evening, Baccha-
nalia, Muse-Haunted, Lament,
Red John, Tantacalladon, The
Pantler’s Son, Elves of Spring,
Song of the Rain, Fairy Story,
Down the Dim Years, Pierrot’s
Address to the Moon, What
the Deer Said, Dragonfly and
Bee Are Sailing, Hunt’s Up!,
Og! Og!, Carillon, Country
Visitor, Voice of the Forest,
The Secret, One Who Shall Be
Nameless, Sunset.
I think that’s all.
And thank you very
much,
Hugh.
I BLOW MY PIPES
I blow my pipes, the glad birds sing
The fat young nymphs about me spring,
The sweaty centaur leaps the trees
And bites his dryad’s splendid knees ;
The sky, the water, and the earth
Repeat aloud our noisy mirth . . .
Anon, tight-bellied Bacchanals,
With ivy from the vineyard walls,
Lead out and crown with shining glass
The wine’s red baby on the grass.
I blow my pipes, the glad birds sing,
The fat young nymphs about me spring,
I am the lord,
I am the lord,
I am the lord of everything!


POLITICAL POINTS
When admiration deteriorates into
adulation it can make people do ridicu-
lous things. In St. John’s Cathedral,
Brisbane, the verger had to rescue a chair
from a swarm of hysterical women
struggling for the privilege of putting
their padded seats on the blue padded
seat on which the Queen Mother had
sat for Divine Service.
• •
The Doc., opening “Labor’s”
campaign in the Parramatta by-election:
“If expenditure on armaments through-
out the world could be limited, controlled
or ended, the standards of living of every-
one would be improved.” It is strikingly
original thinking such as this that keeps
Bert in his job.
• •
Making what is probably the longest
rail-journey ever made in Australia by
such a large flock, 5000 stud Merino ewes
are on their way from Hillston (N.S.W.)
to Esperance (W.A.). The route is via
Broken Hill, Port Pirie, Trans-Aus-
tralian railway to Kalgoorlie, thence via
Norseman to Esperance. For the ‘Trans”
part of the journey they filled 47 trucks
of a train nearly three-quarters of a mile
long.
• •
Ansetts won the dogfight for the control
of Butler Air Transport as a result of a
judgment by Myers, J., in the N. S.
Wales Equity Court. His Honor ruled
that the proxy votes rejected by chairman
of directors Sir John Northcott should be
declared valid. He said that it was equally'
clear to the company and the chairman
that the shareholders intended to vote by
proxy in the poll for directors. As a
result of the decision the directors of
B.A.T. are now C. A. Butler, Reg. Ansett,
E. D. Armstrong, R. D. Collins and J. O.
Declerk. The last three are Ansett men.
As soon as the decision was announced
Ansett said that no more B.A.T. Viscounts
would be chartered to T.A.A. If the com-
pany’s two Viscounts couldn’t be operated
economically in N. S. Wales they would
be chartered by Ansett-A.N.A. for inter-
state services. He said that his company
wanted to see B.A.T. develop as an intra-
state operator in N. S. Wales.
How he plans to square the Viscount
charters with the resolution passed at
the January 21 meeting requiring the
consent of shareholders at a general
meeting to any such move, Ansett did
not explain.
• •
Surveying his loot from the Loan
Council, Bolte remarked complacently
that while other States had pressed for
more funds because they had an unem-
ployment problem, booming Victoria
needed more funds simply to provide
essential services to meet the needs of
rapidly-growing industries; there was
absolutely no reason for anyone in Vic-
toria to fear unemployment. But is it
wise to skite within earshot of the
Canberra bankers?

Alan Manning is resigning from the
D.L.P., of which he is the Federal vice-
president and former N. S. Wales
president. In announcing his decision
not to renew his membership-ticket, he
said he had given the N. S. Wales
executive his reasons for resigning the
presidency six weeks ago and had been
asked to take no further action, but to
“allow the more responsible elements in
the party to deliberate.” No attempt had
been made to do so, and he did not
propose to be involved in attempts to
introduce issues “which can needlessly
injure people with no association with
the D.L.P.”

In two widely different fields Aus-
tralian citizens are being penalised
because they don’t see eye-to-eye with
Labor policy. In Sydney the Labor-
dominated Randwick Council refused
promotion to a woman member of the
library staff because she didn’t belong to
a trade-union. The girl was fully
qualified and had been recommended by
the head librarian, but this cut no ice
with the Labor aldermen, who over-
ruled the librarian and gave the job to an
unqualified girl with a union-ticket.
The Hobart case is worse still. Two
men, father and son, are concerned.
Both are members of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, but because they
have refused to pay a 10s. levy to A.L.P.
funds —they are members of the D.L.P.
—their so-called fellow-workers have
prevented them from getting work on the
wharves.
In one case a girl is denied a job
because she is not a unionist; in the
other unionists are denied a job because
they refuse to contribute to a political
party they don’t believe in. Both these
things are done in the name of Labor.
Is the Federal executive of the A.L.P.
proud to have these things done in its
name? How does the Federal Labor
leader feel about it?

When the Queen visited N. S. Wales
in 1954 Cahill took his responsibilities
as Chief Welcomer a little too seriously ;
her Majesty found him bobbing up in
all sorts of unexpected places. With the
current Royal visitor he is delegating
some of the welcomes. He met the Queen
Mother at Kingsford Smith airport on
Friday afternoon and also conveyed the
State’s message of welcome to her at the
official reception in the evening. Minister
for Local Government Renshaw deputised
for him at Manly on Saturday and
Housing Minister Landa escorted the
visitor on a tour of housing-settlements
on Monday. When the Queen Mother
went to Sydney University yesterday
morning to visit the Research Institute
for Mothers and Infants, Health Minister
Billy Sheahan did the honors and Educa-
tion Minister Heffron was on hand at the
schoolchildren’s rallies in the afternoon.
Joe was “among those present” at the
garden-party at Government House and
later said his farewells at Mascot.

A new £5-million steel-rolling mill
designed to produce steel-strip and having

older mill which will now be diverted to
the production of merchant bar-steel.

If Nasser’s attempt to grab a slice of
Sudanese territory comes before U.N.,
members of the Afro-Asian group of
nations will have to do some heavy think-
ing. This isn’t a question' where fiery
talk of Western colonialism can take the
place of legal argument. What they will
have to ask themselves is whether one
African nation has the right to move a
weaker neighbor’s landmarks.
The area Nasser claims is a triangle of
about 6000 square miles with its base the
22nd parallel and one side on the Red
Sea. The boundary was delineated in
1902, and the Sudanese Prime Minister
has no intention of agreeing to an altera-
tion.

Leslie Bury, Liberal M.H.R. for Went-
worth, told the Constitutional Associa-
tion in Sydney that during his term as
director of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development he
often found it necessary to explain
Australia’s “curious, hybrid” banking
system. He said it was an extraordinary
thing that the Federal Government’s
bill to separate the central-bank and
trading-bank functions of the Common-
wealth Bank—“something which is taken
almost for granted in other countries” —
had caused so much strife and hostility
here. He felt that the reason was that
the Commonwealth Bank, originally set
up by the Labor Government, occupied
“a kind of nostalgic, emotional place in
the community.”

Regulations requiring the compulsory
licensing of secondhand-car dealers will
come into force in N. S. Wales on March

to report any signs of engine-numbers
having been tampered with.


In Nasser’s plebiscite on Egyptian-

A few minutes before the Queen
Mother reached Sydney Town Hall on
her progress through the city, a council
towaway truck pulled up opposite the
edifice and was about to seize an offend-
ing car. Up spake a cop with a sense
of the fitness of things, “Get that flaming
contraption out of the way. The Queen
Mother didn't come here to see that sort
of goings-on.” Off went the truck to
seek a victim in less conspicuous
surroundings.

N. S. Dunlevy, president of the Barrier
District Assembly of the A.L.P., has been
summoned before the N. S. Wales
executive to explain why he said last
year that the Labor party couldn’t win

His obvious explanation should be “ ’Cos
it can’t.”

Housing, hospitals and roads will get
most of the N. S. Wales share of the
Federal special grant. Premier Cahill
says that £1 million will be allocated to
the Housing Commission “to ensure that
houses under existing contracts are com-
menced and completed without any
restrictions being placed on the progress
of contractors.” Five-hundred-thousand
pounds will go towards building 12
hospitals in city and country and £300,000
will be spent on country main roads, its
expenditure being co-ordinated where
possible with local-council road-works
carried out under the supplementary loan-
allocation.
South Australia’s share of the special
grant (£368,000) will all go to the S.A.
Housing Trust for the building of low-
rental homes for war-widows, pensioners
and others unable to pay an economic
rent. Playford says his State’s share of
additional loan-money will also be made-
over to the trust to assist its normal
housing programme and provide more
employment.

On Friday the Commonwealth Con-
ciliation Commission rejected the metal
unions’ application for the restoration of
quarterly, cost-of-living adjustments of
the Federal basic wage. The commission
gave its decision after hearing the argu-
ments of counsel for the applicants and
without calling evidence for the
employers. The president, Justice Kirby,
said that he and his colleagues had given
the claim “mature consideration” and
would publish their reasons later.
In rejecting, the application the com-
mission adhered to the stand it took on
previous applications in 1956 and 1957,
when it held that the basic wage must be
determined by the capacity of industry
to pay.
Hearing of evidence for the second
string of the unions’ claim —an extra
10s. a week —will continue. The com-
mission hopes to complete the hearing
by March 21.

The Liberal party intends to contest 36
N. S. Wales seats at the Federal election
later this year. It will not contest seats
at present held by the Country party, but
will run a candidate for every Labor-held
seat except Darling. All 16 sitting Libs,
were unopposed for preselection ; also the
two retiring Liberal Senators.
• •
Nine hopefuls are seeking the party’s
nomination for Barton, Dr. Evatt’s
deserted seat, and several for Kingsford-
Smith (Dan Curtin) and Parkes (Les
Haylen). An interesting nomination is
that of Alwyn Watkins for Newcastle, a
seat that has been held by his family
ever since Federation. Dave Watkins won
it for Labor at the first Federal election
and retained it till his death in 1935, when
his son, David Oliver, succeeded him.
D.O. is retiring at the end of the present
Parliament and Labor’s candidate will be
C. K. Jones, a former Lord Mayor of
Newcastle. If Alwyn Watkins gets the
Liberal nomination there’ll be a strong
pull between the Watkins tradition and
party loyalties.

Wool-consumption throughout the
world reached record figures last year —
2855-million lb.—though the actual
increase over the previous year’s total
(2853-million lb.) could scarcely be
discerned without the aid of a magnifying-
glass. Britain was the biggest user, with
America, France, Japan and West Ger-
many in that order. Biggest increases
over 1956 were Italy (27 p.c.), Japan (9
pc.), France (7 p.c.). A disquieting note
was the decline in consumption in the
United States, which used 15 p.c. less than
in 1956 and recorded its lowest annual
total for 20 years.

“Wusslean”: Optimistic note sounded
by the Victorian and Federal president
of the Democratic Labor party (Mr. R.
Joshua) at a conference at Geelong (Vic.)
the other day: “The D.L.P. will draw
future support from three main groups—
young people coming of age, those who
were beginning to think seriously of
politics, and migrants.” From the first
and third groups the party may possibly
enlist recruits, but as to the second class
—is there one?

A drive-on-drive-off shipping-service
between Port Adelaide, Kangaroo Island
and Eyre Peninsula is likely as a result
of discussions between the Adelaide
Steamship Co. and Premier Playford. The
co. is thinking in terms of a stern-loading
vessel capable of carrying 40 trailers.
Special loading-facilities will be needed
at the ports to handle the new type of
vessel, and it is expected that the S.A.
Government will co-operate in providing
these.

PERSONAL ITEMS
“Nunk”: Four poets going to Hugh
McCrae’s funeral-service dwelt with a
gloomy expectancy on the clergyman’s
address: they remembered how, of one
of Australia’s finest humorists, the clergy-
man had begun: “I am told that the
deceased had something to do with
journalism . . . ,” how one famous editor
had been spoken-of by the wrong
Christian-name, how another had been
praised as a businessman. But McCrae’s
clergyman was a shock ; he knew Mc-
Crae, spoke of his poetry and quoted
it as if he loved it, related it warmly to
life, made something beautiful and con-
vincing of the old one about the poet
going on living in his poetry. “Brilliant,”
said one of the versifiers as though he had
seen, beyond doubt, an angel; “if I could
feel sure of having him I'd die happy.
Who is he?” They said they rather
thought it was Major-General the Rev.
C. A. Osborne.

Keith Young, captain, U.S.A.A.F.—
“the most fabulous character in the U.S.
Air Force” (quote from “Stars and
Stripes”)—was bom in Melbourne 42
years ago. In 1938 he left Australia for
the United States en route to the Spanish
Civil War, but it was over before he was
able to participate. In Hollywood he
did a bit of writing, a bit of acting. Then
in August, 1942, he enlisted in the U.S.
Army, and served in Europe in Intelli-
gence. He returned to Australia in 1946
and “messed around” in the N.T. buffalo-
shooting ; back there again in 1950 he
visited the Ruined City in Arnhem Land,
on which he commented (from America)
in B. 28 /11 / ’56. In 1950, in the United
States again, he re-enlisted, trained in
escape and evasion, and went to Korea
in 1953. He was captured—and escaped
from the Communist forces, still
regarded as a remarkable feat. He
returned to the U.S. in 1957, and was
appointed instructor at Survival School,
Stead Air Force Base, Reno, Nevada. On
leave in Australia again, he called in at
The Bulletin last week and collected
his cheque for the Arnhem Land article.

While Aria sketched him, in at The
Bulletin office, Frederick Doreen Bolin,
the new County Clerk of the Cumberland
County Council, talked quietly and
impressively about local-government: He
joined the Waratah (Newcastle) Council
in 1922, and, with time out for service
with the R.A.A.F. (ops. officer at 52
0.8. U., Darwin, and acting C.O. for a
time ; with 79 Wing at Batchelor, then
to 11 and 20 Squadrons, with the Cata-
linas, at Morotai, and Tarakan and later
Labuan; on to Tawi-Tawi in the
Philippines, then Kuching, Sarawak,’
where he was O.C. of the Air Force
detachment liaising with the Navy and
Army) he’s been in local-government ever
since. During his time there as Town
Clerk, Shellharbor won the Bluett Award,
and he’s written a good deal on l.g. for
specialist journals. A gardener at
Wahroonga and surfer these days, he
used to play Rugby Union at Newcastle
with Carlton and Wanderers, and his son
now plays for Sydney University.
What he had to say about local-govern-
ment impressed this interviewer, particu-
larly, because of its balance and clarity ;
pros and cons of large and small l.g.
LOCAL-GOVERNMENT
bodies discussed impartially, with a glance
at English and American tendencies, a
note on local differences ; a thumbnail
sketch of the history of rating ; the inter-
action of l.g. and State powers and
responsibilities ; all in clear outline, un-
burdened with technicalities, and in the
course of natural conversation. An im-
portant subject, one realised, after a few
minutes, and one about which most of
us know a good deal less than we should.

“S.J.A.”: Hugh Robert Munro, of
Keera station, Bingara (N.S.W.), died
on February 14, his 96th birthday, and
in the 100th year after his father, Donald
Munro, took charge at Keera. The
youngest and last surviving of 10
children, Hugh Munro used to travel to
Newington College (which in his day
stood on the Parramatta River) by horse-
back, coach and train to Morpeth or
Newcastle, thence by steamer to Sydney.
By contrast, in his latter years, a
chartered aircraft would take him from
his own strip at Keera to connect with the
nearest airline. His last flight, the day
before his death, was to Walcha to
attend the picnic-races.
A few days earlier he had been riding,
and drafting cattle, both lifelong
customs. His name is always identified
with Keera stud cattle and thorough-
bred horses, but he had many other
interests and properties. Some of these
were Gundibri (Merriwa) and Oakhurst
(Boggabilla), where he founded well-
known Poll Shorthorn studs ; Moogoon
and Wyaga (Goondiwindi, Q.), the latter
a Merino and Shorthorn stud ; Cubbaroo
(Burren Junction), voluntarily made
available to soldier-settlers of War II
when group-promotion came in; and,
of late years, a Poll Merino stud at
Oakhurst. He was also a director of
Pitt, Son and Badgery, Ltd., and other
firms connected with the pastoral
industry. He was patron or president of
many race-clubs, also a member of the
Sydney Tattersall’s, the Australian Club,
Royal Sydney Golf Club and the R.A.S.;
a life-member of the Aberdeen Angus
and Poll Shorthorn societies of Australia,
and had countless similar interests.
He was very proud of his Pioneer
Medal, presented by the Shire of Bingara,
of which he was the oldest native-born
resident; also of the fact that the A.M.P.
Society paid his life-insurance policies in
full at a function at the Hotel Australia,
Sydney, in 1956. He retained to the end
his ability to make new friends, and
never looked back or grew lonely as he
aged. He loved social gatherings,
especially picnic-races and balls.

showed such administrative ability that
he was put in charge of that and three

“BulJetina”: Thanks to The Bulletin
(“Personal Items,” 29/1/’5B) for
pleasing news of an old acquaintance—
Keith Macnamara, now a successful
songwriter. Keith, a War II veteran, did
a rehab, course at Sydney Conserva-
torium, studying music-composition. He
gave it up, however, and then lived at
Middle Harbor, overlooking Bantry Bay,
where he built, largely with his own


hands, a three-story stone house. He
quarried and cut the stone, and built up
to 10ft. himself, working at music at the
same time, setting Helen Isherwood’s
lyrics, and having a few piano-lessons
from Miss Shadforth Hooper, a neighbor.
Then he disappeared, leaving his fine
house. MacNamara believed that a home
should be built of the local material:
stone on the harbor, pise on the plains,
and so on. His house can be seen below
Dalwood Home, a half-mile or so in the
bush.

J. E. Macdonnell: A red sun setting
into a purple sea, the fiery stare concen-
trated on the submarine—within the
visibility of 15 miles from the black
outline of the bridge there was nothing
else seaborne for the sun to shine on —
the ocean darkening, drawing all about
the low shape the wheel of the horizon,
except to the west, where the cliffs of
Jervis Bay broke the smooth weld of sea
and sky in a fanged edge. H.M.S. Tele-
machus. The man on the bridge, in black
T-shirt and football strides, was her
captain, Lieutenant-Commander Peter
Hay, R.N. I was there as a visitor,
collecting material for a book.
“Starb’d twenty!”
Hay stood at the fore-end of the
bridge, in front of the forrard periscope-
standard, leaning his body a little to
counter her lean as the rudder went over.
He is broad, hefty, face weathered like a
walnut. The drawing of him by Dubois
was done later, on shore, after the week
of hide-and-seek with asdic-training ship
Swan was over. But we had not started
the exercise yet
things were easy.
Presently “Telly”
slipped like a black
slug towards where
Point Perpendicular
light stood like a
bleached bone stuck
on the cliffs. The
beginning of an
interesting week. . .
Hay’s first ship
was battleship Nelson
(of the enormous
fo’c’sle and nine 16in.
guns). Telemachus
has something like
1500 tons burthen
against Nelson’s
34,000, but her eight
torpedo-tubes could
do something violent
about that tonnage—
or so all submarines
cockily, and rightly,
feel. He did the
normal gunnery,
navigational courses
of general service,
had a stint in
destroyers, plumped
for the submersibles,
and joined his first
boat in Aden in 1944,
a temporary officer
who stayed three
years in her. Her
name was Tele-
machus, and now,
after having skip-
pered two other
boats, he commands
her. Most of his war-
time patrolling was
done from Trincomalee or Fremantle. Ffe
golfs in a desultory way, plays cricket
of the village-green type, and shortly
hopes to surface for good, where he has
something in a shoreside capacity lined-
up back in England.

In Melbourne is Dr. George Loughlin,
the dark-horse chosen from a Melbourne
Cup field last July as the University’s new
Ormond Professor of Music, succeeding
Sir Bernard Fleinze. Lately he has been
lecturer in music at Glasgow University.
He is a composer, chiefly of chamber-
music for string-quartets and trios, a
pianist, organist and broadcaster. But
he was chosen for the £3OOO-a-year job
because he is rather more of a professor
of music than an entertainer; the
University was looking for a man who
would not divide his time between it and
the concert-hall.
Dr. Loughlin, who disembarked
recently with his wife and two young
sons, learned the piano in London from
Australian composer Arthur Benjamin.
He is 43, and he will retire at 60.

ABORIGINALITIES
IN the Centre a few years ago I jeeped
out about 15 miles from an advanced
post to check a trig-point. The job
finished, I was about to return when I had
an urge to drive on to the distant horizon,
where a clump of vegetation marked the
start of a sand-ridge.
There were no tracks out there and, so
far as I was aware, the area had never
been explored. There was no valid reason
for making a foolish and possibly hazard-
ous trip over unknown terrain, but I had
a strong feeling that I had to see what
was out there.
The going was very rough, but I
reached the area to find an emaciated
gin with a young baby lying under a
stunted mulga. Both appeared to be near
death.
The water-bag revived the gin and
brought some signs of life to the baby,
whose body was plastered with clay and
ashes. After lifting both into the back of
the jeep I gave the gin two tins of bully-
beef, then set out for our base-hospital 60
miles south.
A full-blood interpreter said the gin
was a member of a nomad group of the
Pitjintjara tribe. It appeared that on
walkabout the baby had become ill and
the elders decreed it should be abandoned.
The gin preferred the white-man’s magic
and sneaked away on a 70-mile hike to
where I found her.
She told the interpreter she knew help
would be available at that particular spot.
They both recovered.
Old Opencut.

“Bagot”: “Irving’s” childhood custom
of running around hats (B. 29/l/’5B)
recalls a morning ritual once performed
by just about every kid in the Westralian
goldmining town of Trafalgar. Near the
State school was an abandoned shaft
ringed by a 15ft.-high dump of mullock.
The yarn had spread that, by running
once around the top, young Golden Mile
Aussies would be ensured immunity from
corporal punishment for the day. It was
a miracle that none of us was knocked
down the gaping hole in the mad scamper
which went on —until unabated swish-
ing of canes and accompanying yelps
convinced us that the powers of the old
shaft had petered out.

“Squinter”: A race analogous to South
Africa’s “Cape Coloreds” —who are
distinct and apart from the African blacks
—is growing fast around the North
Westralian ports and confounding
optimists who held that in a few genera-
tions the blacks would have been com-
pletely assimilated into the white race.
“W ake-up, darling — Dadda Wants you to take him a Walkie-porkie
Instead, they’re forming brown-skinned
communities arising, like the Cape
Coloreds, from the union of Asiatic and
black. Both the color and the communi-
ties are distinct, and the people are virile
and, in the main, capable. They haven’t
the opportunities of the whites and so far
they haven’t demanded them, collectively,
but they will; and it will be hard to deny
them. These people are Australians and
they’re here to stay; and there’s
probably a big part for them to play in
the development of the north. There’s
both problem and opportunity there for
any Government game to grasp them.

“Macquarie”: Oliver Filter quotes
correctly from A Guide for Riggers con-
cerning the method of measuring wire-
rope (B. 29/1/’58); but in A Guide for
Scaffolders, another very useful little
book printed by the same authority, the
section headed “Wire Ropes” begins with
this paragraph: “Measurement: Wire-
ropes are measured by the diameter of the
circle that will enclose the cross-section
of the rope, and referred to either by
diameter or circumference as the case
may be. To avoid confusion, circum-
ference and diameter should both be
quoted.” Incidentally, I imagine that the
Silent Service would hold similar views
to the Army, which never uses wire-rope
—officially. “Rope,” in Army parlance,
automatically specifies wire-rope. Fibre-
rope is “cordage.”

“Cowyard Kate”: I, too, knew a cove
who was forced to adopt a disguise to
trick cantankerous milkers (B. 15/1/’5B).
When his wife, who always did the milk-
ing, was whisked-off to hospital for an
urgent op., he had to don her old frock,
apron and sun-bonnet before he could
start operations (she always milked them
unbailed, anywhere). The puzzled
expressions on the cows were caused by
their trying to reconcile the clobber with
the language.

“Retired Bagman”: Bert, in from the
swamp-country, had sold a few bullocks
and was celebrating the occasion in
traditional fashion. When a cop sought
to call a halt to the revelries the reveller
made it a willing rough-and-tumble. At
the end of it Bert cheerfully accompanied
his captor around to the station, follojved
by various admirers contesting the
privilege of putting up his bail. Next
morning Bert was fined 50-bob. “Strike
me handsome! ” he wailed. “I don’t know
what the country’s cornin’ to. Even
before inflation it was never worth less
than a fiver to do-over a copper! ”

“Kelms”: Whatever it was that caused
“Bungaroo’s” three cockies to become ill
after each had worn the same leather
leggings (B. 5/2/’5B), it certainly wasn’t
poison from a snake-fang embedded in
the leather. Few Australian snakes have
fangs long enough to penetrate that sort




of leather, and they would also have to
protrude far enough to press through the
trouser-leg and scratch the leg. In any
case, when the snake struck, most of the
poison would have run off the polished
leather on the outside, and most of the
rest would have been absorbed by the
inside leather ; the infinitesimal remainder
wouldn't get through. I suggest that “B.”
investigate the possibility of witchcraft.

Sydney “Sun” made the discovery
recently, through the medium of a 95-
year-old suburban woman, that the festive
Edward once lived at “Glen Rowie.”
Pronouncing him to have been “a perfect
gentleman and the picture of kindness,”
the old lady said (according to the “Sun”),
“Ned lived next-door to me at Glen
Rowie,” and later she was quoted as
saying (“with a faraway look in her eyes”),
“The Kellys lived next-door to Dad’s
place at Glen Rowie.” Actually, Ned
was a product of the village of Beveridge,
near Wallan Wallan, and, although the
family lived later a few miles out of Glen-
rowan, his closest association with that
township was through the medium of
his last fight with the constabulary. I’m
not blaming the veteran for getting her
"Don't panic —they're not poisoned!"
bushranging data jumbled, but I should
have thought that Glenrowan (alias
Glen Rowie ) was one of the few Aus-
tialian place-names well known to even
the most callow reporter ot today.

“Piston Pete”: Vic, the schoolie, and
his district inspector were out for a day's
duck-shooting. The inspector’s defence
against the heat was a thermos of tea.
Vic’s a flask of a different brew. After
a lean time conversation lagged, thermos
and flask emptied; then a solitary duck
rose within range. “Yours!” called Vic.
As the inspector’s shot went wide the
chalkie raised his gun casually and fired,
and the bird plummeted to earth. “Magni-
ficent shot!” exclaimed the d.i. Vic shook
his head slowly. “Not so hot,” he said.
“Bloke couldn’t help hitting one in a flock
that size!”
* * * *
“Penulis” (Malaya): A labor officer
visiting a saw-mill found that a new saw-
bench had no safety-guard. When he
remonstrated with the Chinese proprietor
the latter was so profuse in his apologies
and so anxious to remedy the defect that
the 1.0. agreed tc send him a drawing
of a suitable guard. On his next visit
to the mill Hi Lo proudly pointed to the
“guard”: the drawing, framed like an
Old Master, suspended from the rafters
directly above the saw! *
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: I didn’t say the
kangaroo isn’t herbivorous (B. 15/1 /’58);
I said it wasn’t a vegetarian, and it isn’t.
All the marsupials in Australia are
thought to have evolved from a small
carnivore not much bigger than a rat.
From that have come the marsupial
counterparts of most of the old-world
mammalian forms —carnivores, grass-
eaters, tree-dwellers, burrowers, insec-
tivores, etc. —and there are bound to be
some species not so highly specialised as
others, without being actually atavistic.
Thus there are some species amongst
the smaller marsupials that are partial to
insects and honey, and wallabies are
known to catch fish by standing in a
stream and scooping them up with their
forepaws. I’ve seen kangaroos around
dead blackboys picking out what I’ve
assumed were bardies, and on the other
hand the fat-tailed dunnart, a diminutive
bundle of ferocity which devours mice
bigger than itself, will eat cheese with
relish. The dunnart is a carnivore, just
as the Too is a herbivore, but neither
sticks strictly to what “Manamoi” would
term its “natural” diet.
* * * *
“X. Y. Zog”: A fertile mating between
a cat (however possumlike) and a possum
(however catlike) is impossible
(B. 1/1/'5B). They belong to two entirely
different orders —the cat to the carnivora
and the possum to the marsupials. The
ability of animals to mate fertilely is
governed not by coincidences like color
or pattern of fur but by genetics, i.e., the
number of chromosomes and type of
genes in the reproductive cells. These
in turn are determined by the real relation-
ship of the animals to each other. There
are crosses between species in the .same
genera (although the offspring are nearly
always infertile “mules”); and, rarely,
there are crosses between species in
different but closely related genera —but
for any two animals in different orders
to produce a fertile cross is a genetic
impossibility.
* * * *
“Curate’s Egg”: That'piggery where the
occupants self-grade themselves according
to size (B. 8/1/’5B) recalls an installation
operated by a scientifically-minded
N.S.W. bacon-raiser. He fitted the backs
of the troughs with a long row of mirrors.
The speed at which he managed to fatten
his porcine property seemed to bear out
his theory that each pig, under the impres-
sion that a rival on the opposite side of
the trough was competing with him,
would outdo its record for surround-
ing the scran. I’ve never seen forced-
feeding like it.
DEPARTURE OF THE SWIFTS
High in the skies in thunder-weather
l saw them muster and mill and swarm.
One and a thousand birds of a feather
Swirling about a mounting storm ;
Disappearing and reappearing
Low in the shades, high in the sun,
Lost and found again where the rearing
Thunderheads melt and overrun;
Off —and over the Bay’s bright dimples
Rocketing (catch them if you can).
Soon to be circling round the temples,
Cities and shrines of old Japan ;
Summering somewhere in far Cathay,
Feasting on steppes still further west
(It is whispered that some still know the
way
To good Saint Brandon’s Isle of the
Blest.)
But, gone to glory or Timbuctoo,
Whether to Elfland or Avalon,
One and a thousand or two by two
The swifts but follow where summer has
gone.
VICTORIA.
KATHLEEN DALZIEL.


A LTHOUGH the old saying “as
pleased as a dog with two tails” may
be based on accurate observation, it
doesn’t follow that other animals have
any reason to be grateful for a double
issue of rudders. Take the fox, recently
reported from the Renmark district in
South Australia, who was so blessed.
Where did it get him? A farmer spotted
him, put two sheepdogs on his trail and
“the fox ran into its burrow, where it
was killed,” After which, presumably, the
dogs ran off looking as pleased as dogs
that have killed a fox with two tails. —
“Findy.”
* * * *
“Baksac”: I can assure “Spin” that
the range of the “greenie” silvereye
extends considerably beyond the south-
west of W.A., a couple of hundred miles
inland, and on islands 10 or 12 miles off
shore (B. 15 /1 / ’5B). It is not only native
to N.S.W., but is firmly established in
N.Z. The bird is, however, an Enzedder
by adoption only—the Maori name for it
proves that point: tauhou, or “stranger.”
In N.S.W., civilisation often over-
takes the white-spectacled little bloke, but
can’t chase him away. For instance, Red
Cross workers at the blood-bank in the
very heart of Sydney were mystified as to
the cause of damage done to bowls of
fruit left near open windows. Eventually
the culprit was identified —“Silver,” of
course.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: When Nature began
experimenting with flying - machines,
she thought of chitin —that white, form-
less substance that insects, and crabs and
lobsters, use as the base for their hard
shells. She picked the dragonfly as the
subject for a really big experiment in this
direction, and the prototype proved so
successful that the old dame soon had
squadrons on mosquito patrol, with wing-
spans up to 2ft., built of chitin. Later,
when heavy bombers went out in favor
of fighters, whatever other modifications
Nature made she still stuck to chitin as
the wing-material, and it hasn’t let her
down. Take a look at a. dragonfly’s
wings sometime and say whether any
other material in such thin sheets could
withstand the stresses and strains imposed
on those wings as the insect touches 60
m.p.h., stops dead, flips sideways, back-
wards, up or down at instantaneous top
speed, sometimes carrying a payload of
mosquitoes half as heavy as itself.
* * *
“Kelms”: The earth still passes
through meteor-showers (B. 15/1 /’5B),
the most pronounced being those we
strike every November, with spectacular
displays scheduled for every 33 years.
These showers are from bodies, or clouds
of meteorites, revolving round the sun on
an orbit which brings them very close to
earth on November 12 each year. The
orbit is elliptical and the meteors com-
plete it in 33| years, which accounts for
the more brilliant displays at that inter-
val. These have attracted attention for
over 1000 years and seem to have
occurred until 1866; but before the
scheduled appearance in 1899 the swarms
“Boo!”
passed close to Jupiter and Saturn and
there was nothing particularly spectacular
in 1899 or 1932. If November of 1965
brings only the ordinary annual visitation
it may be assumed that the displays won’t
occur again. But there are hundreds of
other such meteor-swarms, of known
orbits, through each of which earth passes
at roughly the same date each year.
COBB AND CO. STILL RUNS
ALTHOUGH the horsepower is in a
form different from that of their
heyday in passenger-transport, the motor-
bus Cobb and Co. Coaches Pty., Ltd.,
has put on the 45-mile run between
Taroom and Wandoan (Q.) serves one
of Queensland’s oldest bush roadways.
When W. R. Bolton presented me with
ticket No. 501 issued by Cobb and Co.
Coaches for use between that very ancient
town of Taroom and Wandoan, which is
the terminus of the railway branch-line
from Miles, I noted that the ticket also
entitled me to break the journey at
Linger-and-die (a relic of those early
days, with waterless stretches in the briga-
low-scrub areas).
When W. R. Bolton bought the trade-
name of “Cobb and Co.” years ago, as
well as a string of motor-trucks to operate
in southern Queensland, carrying goods
for primary-producers and the business
fraternity, he hadn’t dreamt of going
back with Cobb and Co. into the business
of carrying back-country passengers over
a route on which there was no service of
public or private transport.
But he hailed from that brigalow
country where the folk of Miles and
Taroom have watched the coming of the
motor-vehicle transform their industries,
and he felt that the Taroom people
deserved a road-transport service. The
fares he is charging may show a loss for
his coach-company, but he is prepared to
shoulder that.
Originally the Government led by
Digby Denham under the old Nationalist
(or Liberal) ticket had planned to build
a branch-railway to link the old town of
Taroom (sitting on the great Dawson
River) with Miles on the western railway.
They had constructed the 43 miles to
the new town of Wandoan, and opened
it on December 16, 1914, but World War I
brought operations to an end.
The following year the Labor party,
under T. J. Ryan, gained office and
remained in control for 14 unbroken
years. But their policy was not attuned
to the needs of the cattlemen and
selectors who battled droughts and ail
the other hazards of pastoral-production
in the back-country, so the railway was
never carried to its logical terminus at
Taroom.
The evolution of means to clear the
brigalow scrub from some of Queensland’s
richest areas of deep black-soil (an
enormous area of which lies in the vicinity
of Miles, Wandoan and Taroom) has
seen the pioneering of profitable grain-
growing on areas of 640 acres in this
locality.
One of the pioneers was the late James
Woodside, who came from northern
Victoria as a selector in the Wandoan
area. At his property, Wallace Brae,
Guluguba, just south of Wandoan, he pro-
duced results that stimulated many others
to follow his lead, often with his assist-
ance.
His pioneering example and industry
stimulated Bill Bolton to name the
motor-coach plying between Taroom and
Wandoan “The James Woodside.”

THE MOVIE MERGER
'T'HOUGH the four Australian
-*■ companies now half-owning
Greater Union Theatres, Ltd.,
got together as far back as
1913 in forming a film and
“picture-show” combine, each
holding-co. has retained its
identity up to the present time ;
for a long period, too, different
members of the group have also
held freehold or leasehold
theatre properties apart from
those owned wholly by the
combine.
Now, after 45 years, it is
proposed to effect a complete
merger of Spencer’s, Wests,
Amalgamated Pictures and
Greater J. D. Williams.
[The Kandos - Australian
Cement combine might take a
cue from this ; also the Aus-
tralian Gypsum Products
holding-cos.]
Various have been the
rearrangements and introduc-
tions since the formation of the
General Film Co. shortly
before World War I, but the
position today is that Greater
Union Theatres, Ltd., is half-
owned (through its £400,000
ordinary capital) by the Rank
Group in England, the other
half being in the control of
Wests, Ltd., Greater J. D.
Williams, Spencer's Pictures
and Amalgamated Pictures,
these Australian-listed com-
panies also owning all the
£500,000 of preference capital
Between them these Australian
companies own half the shares
in British Empire Films, Ltd.,
Rank Film Distributors of
Australia Pty., National
Theatre Supply Co., and Sixteen
Millimetre Australia Pty. In
each case the Rank Group owns
the other 50 p.c. of the shares.
Greater Union owns all the
ords. in Union Theatres Invest-
ments, Ltd., Cinesound Pro-
ductions and Automatic Film
Laboratories Pty.
[The first drive-in theatres in
N.S.W. began screening towards the
end of 1956, and G.U.T. has an
interest in some of these —the Sky-
line drive-ins at Bass Hill, Caring-
bah, Dundas, French’s Forest and
North Ryde, all in conjunction with
Consolidated Drive-in Theatres
Corp. Pty. Interests are also held
in Skyline drive-ins at Lambton and
“The bachelors get fruit-cake— WE get bickies !”
Wollongong (N.S.W.). The co. has
other interests in drive-ins in Vic-
WA ‘ SA ‘’ 33
All these interests are in addition
to the co.’s major interests—a chain
of about 30 leading picture-theatres
a? a'Mo
suburban theatres. In all, G.U.T.,
either directly or by way of associa-
tJ'on > is .interested in about 150
theatres, including the State theatres
j n Sy dne y Melbourne and Adelaide.]
Basis of the Merger
The directors of the four
holding-cos. have now unani-
mously agreed to a proposal
the basis of which is that
Spencer’s Pictures, Ltd., will
offer to the individual share-
holders in each of the other
three cos. to take over their
present shareholdings and to
issue to them, in exchange for
their present shares, ord. shares
in Spencer’s on the following
basis:
(a) West’s, Ltd.
Spencer’s will issue 1.8 stock-units
of ss. each for each ss. stock-unit
held by shareholders in West’s.
(b) Amalgamated Pictures, Ltd.
Spencer’s will issue 1.8 ss. stock-
units for each ss. stock-unit held by
ord. shareholders in Amalgamated.
It is also proposed that an offer be
made to the participating pref. share-
holders of eight ord. stock-units of
ss. each in Spencer’s for each £1
participating pref. held.
(c) The Greater J. D. Williams’
Amusement Co., Ltd.
Spencer’s will issue 1.27 stock-
units of ss. each for each ss. stock-
unit.
The offer is contingent upon
acceptance by at least 90 p.c.
of the shareholders in each
holding-co.
The effect of this proposal
will be: —*
For each 100 ss.
stock-units now
owned share-
holders would
receive in
Spencer’s the
undermentioned
Company. stock-units.
West's.. .. 180
Amalgamated
Pictures .. 180
Greater J. D,
Williams .. 127
In the case of the prefs. in
Amalgamated Pictures, 100
prefs. of £1 each would be
exchanged for 800 ord. stock-
units of ss. each.
Shareholders in Spencer’s
maintain the number of stock-
units they at present hold in
that co. In other words,
Spencer’s is “on scratch.”
Smith, Johnson and Co.,
auditors of three of the com-
panies and also of Greater
Union Theatres Pty., say that
in their opinion it would be
quite impossible to make any-
thing in the nature of a precise
mathematical computation a;
to the relative worth of these
four public-company under-
takings, but having regard to
the particular circumstances, to
the information before them
and to certain supplementary
calculations which they have
made, they consider that the
equities of all ordinary share-
holders would be substantially
maintained if the merger were
arranged on the basis set-out
by the directors.
Future Dividends
The various directors
anticipate that the 8| p.c.
dividend at present paid by
Spencer’s Pictures, Ltd., can be
maintained, and the following
table shows a comparison of
the dividend income which
should be received by share-
holders after the amalgama-
tion, compared with what they
have received before the
amalgamation:

Grea>6r J. D.
Williams .. £lO 0 0 £lO 15 11
Amalgamated £l4 0 0 £l5 6 0
The participating preference-
shareholders in Amalgamated
would receive £l7 for each £l4
now received in dividend.
The shareholders in each of
the foregoing three cos. gain
slightly in income, and at the
last balancing-date (June 30),
each of these three cos. had
surplus profits over the divi-
dends then distributed. On the
basis of the 8y p.c. div., the
shareholders in Spencer’s would
receive the same dividend as
they are at present receiving.
The usual interim dividend
for the half-year ended
December 31, 1957, payable by
each of the four cos., will be
paid on February 28, 1958. The
new shares issued by Spencer’s
Pictures, Ltd., will rank for
dividend as from January 1,
1958.
The present issued capital of
Spencer’s is £297,714. To enable
the amalgamation to be carried
out it is suggested that nominal
capital be increased to
£2,500,000.
Capital, £1,128,336

shares were accepted by all the
shareholders of the three cos.

What’s in a name?
Names, of course, are largely a matter of
chance. As Shakespeare observed, a rose by
any other name would smell as sweet.
The name of the Bank of New South Wales
originates from the fact that Captain Cook
thought he saw a similarity between South
Wales and part of the Australian coast. In
1770 he took possession of the eastern coast
of Australia, and later named it “New South
Wales”.
“New South Wales” was the name of all
the settled parts of Australia when the Bank
of New South Wales was established in 1817.
The Governor of the day even regarded “New
South Wales” as also including New Zealand,
Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Tahiti.
Today, the “Wales” (as the Bank is now
familiarly known) with over 1,000 branches
and agencies, serves every State in the
Commonwealth, as well as New Zealand, Fiji,
Papua and New Guinea. It is Australia’s
oldest free enterprise company and largest
trading bank.
BANK OF
NEW SOUTH WALES
FIRST BANK IN AUSTRALIA
(incorporated in new south wales with limited liability)
A5761c
would be represented by
4,513,344 stock-units of ss.
each.
Aggregate profits for the
four cos. for the year ended
June 30, 1957, amounted to
£97,978, and the 8y p.c. divi-
dend on the new capital of
£1,128,336 amounts to £95,908.
It has always been the
policy to distribute full
earnings in each of the four
cos. in view of the fact that
reserves are built-up and
retained in the Greater Union
Group.
When the merger is complete,
Spencer’s will change its name
to Amalgamated Holdings,
Ltd., which is so much of a
change as to be almost a
disguise.
Group Earnings
For the year ended December
31, 1956, Greater Union
Theatres showed a consolidated
net profit of £262,216, com-
pared with £270,136 in the pre-
ceding year. After deducting
the proportion belonging to
outside shareholders of sub-
sidiary companies, the
remainder was £225,061, com-
pared with £231,830 and
£213,539 in the two preceding
years.
Consolidated net profit for
1956 was arrived at after setting
aside £200,000 for television
contingencies, the same amount
as in the preceding year. The
board considered these pro-
visions “prudent, and indeed
necessary.” The total so pro-
vided up to a year ago was
£550,000.
Of the 1956 net profit, 5
p.c. to pref.-shareholders (Aus-
tralian public cos.) took
£25,000, and £62,500 went to
the same group on their ord.
shares, with another £62,500
to the Rank organisation.
The amount of dividends
received by each of the four
Australian public cos. was as
follows:
Ord. Pref.
Div. Div. Total.
£ £ £
West’s .. 16,375 6,550 22,925
Greater J.D.W. 20,312 8,125 28,437

Amalgamated 9,125 3,650 12,775
62,500 25,000 87,500
The Greater Union Group
presented a balance-sheet show-
ing paid capital to be £920,000
in £500,000 of pref. money and
£420,000 in ords. Capital
reserves total £544,507, general
reserves £203,159, p. and 1.
balances £1,021,381, provisions
for TV contingencies £550,000.
Interests of outside shareholders
in subsidiaries were £553,101.
Freeholds, including the State
theatres, are in mostly at pre-
war cost. Total fixed assets
appear at £5,115,697, against
which there is a depreciation
and amortisation reserve of
£1,589,384. Against the visible
reserved profits and obvious
inner strength there is £564,992
of intangibles.
Although another year’s
results must now be known by
the board of G.U.T., the
shareholding public will not be
informed of them until accounts
of the holding-cos. (or the one
new holding-co.) come out
after June 30 next.
But, in the circular
announcing the amalgama-
tion terms, the various boards
of directors seem to have little
doubt that the present rate of
distribution by G.U.T. can be
maintained for the immediate
future at least.
The group is not underesti-
mating the possible impact of
TV, as its reserve of £550,000
indicates. But after deducting
the £200,000 set aside in 1956
to fight TV competition, the
G.U.T. share of the net profit
of £225,061 represented 11 p.c.
on the proposed capital of the
new Amalgamated Holdings,
Ltd. A continued 81 p.c. div.
should therefore be compara-
tively easy.
Butler Air Transport
npHE long legal battle over
A control of Butler Air Trans-
port, Ltd., having ended in the
N.S.W. Equity Court in favor of
Ansett-A-N.A., after a variety
of devices had been used on
both sides to increase their
voting-power at general meet-
ings of 8.A.T., it has been
announced that R. M. Ansett
will take the Butler chairman’s
seat, which was recently vacated
by Sir John Northcott, formerly
Governor of N.S.W. An
Ansett-A.N.A. spokesman is
reported as saying that B.A.T.
will remain a separate com-
pany, and, with its subsidiary,
Queensland Airlines, would
become a big “feeder line.”
Gas at Camden
[From L. Owen]
TTHE announcement that
A a measurable quantity of
inflammable gas has been
struck in a bore near Camden
(N.S.W.), at a depth of 1355 ft.,
is good news, although some
shows of gas in that environ-
ment were inevitable.
However, neither the rate of
flow (stated to be 50,000 cu. ft.
a day, over a 12-hour test) nor
the “built-up” pressure (3001 b.
per sq. in.) is impressive, and
any undue optimism should be
avoided.
An output of 50,000 cu. ft. (or
50 Mcf. in gas-well parlance)
of gas a day, particularly as
initial production, is very small
beer commercially. A small
Sydney household would con-
sume over that amount in a
year at a retail cost of about
£35. The normal pressure at
the depth of 1355 ft. should be
around 6001 b. per sq. in. The
fact that it is described as
“built-up” suggests a fall in
pressure on opening-up and,
therefore, a very limited
reservoir.
Even a large initial gas-flow
is of little value unless it is
persistent. Further tests
which should now be in pro-
gress—will supply the answer.
The gas is described as being
“methane type.” Presumably
that implies that it is “dry” and
derived from the underlying
coal-measures. It would cer-
tainly have no contact with
liquid petroleum.

“Lola Montez”
Miss Montez, a hot-
tempered, Spanish-Irish mis-
tress to Ludwig I of Bavaria
(and others), a great beauty,
if somewhat past her prime
and growing baggy-eyed, sexy
“spider”-dancer, strong-armed
horsewhip-cracker (as the
editor of the critical “Ballarat
Times” came to discover) and
collector of gold nuggets from
pop-eyed miners, has (and
rightly so) been made the
subject of a new Australian
musical comedy.
It is a lusty, full-hearted job
in the hands of the Melbourne
Union Theatre Rep. players in
association with the Eliza-
bethan Trust. Lola is authored
by three Australians —Peter
Stannard (music), Peter Benja-
min (lyrics) and Alan Burke
(book).
No one would claim, least
of all the authors, that this
musical owes nothing to its
American and English equiva-
lents, especially the music—
some of the best tunes have
overseas big brothers. But for
all that “Lola Montez” was a
definite success, and looks
likely to continue as such for
some time.
It suffers very little in a
comparison with overseas
importations, and the story of
the legendary Lola and her
setting in Ballarat holds much
interest for home-grown audi-
ences. She might even be
successfully exported.
In the programme-notes
Lola is a reigning beauty of
mid-Victorian Europe: in the
musical she claims she only
left Bavaria for “the good of
the country,” a snap of her
fingers being sufficient to bring
Ludwig to her way of think-
ing. She visited Australia in
1855 and 1856, performing
elaborate autobiographical acts
(including her seduction of her
royal patron) in several cities,
of which Ballarat was one and
was her favorite because of
the miners’ readiness to toss
her nuggets of gold. Mr.
Seekamp, editor of the
“Ballarat Times,” however,
thought her dance damaging
to local morals and didn’t
hesitate to say so in his paper ;
and she didn’t hesitate to storm
into his office with her
renowned horsewhip, crack
him a few times and depart
triumphant.
In between Lola’s story Alan
Burke has woven the ancient
love-tale. Daniel Brady dis-
covers his long-lost sweetheart,
Jane Oliver, playing nurse in
Ballarat. He also finds a dirty
big lump of gold, gets drunk
and ambitious and falls for
the wiles of Montez. But in the
good old manner of musicals
the world over, it all ends
happily. A few copybook
morals pop up as the musical
progresses something hack-
neyed about forgetting dreams
and facing reality—but nobody
seems to take much notice and
no damage is done.
The performance opened a
little self-consciously, the first
songs being sung by men who
were obviously good actors but
could hardly be called trained
singers—a few notes missed, a
few inaudible, quite a lot off-
key. Some of the choruses
were exceptionally good, some
tame. There was none of the
force we have come to expect
from musicals in these choruses
and in many of the solos, but
it hardly mattered in the well-
designed Union Theatre —in a
larger auditorium the voices
might be lost unless this were
rectified. One or two male
voices are needed to lift the
rest. The background—or, to
this reviewer, the foreground—
music, was delivered by two
pianos and drums. It was well-
enough written and well-enough
played, but lacked variety. .
The sets wei;e simple and the
product of careful thought by
Warwick Armstrong. They
were entirely satisfactory, as
were his costumes. John
Sumner’s production left
nothing to chance and kept
the show moving and lively.
Among the large cast Justine
Rettick, as Lola, proved the
most accomplished singer and
an energetic actress. She
looked the part. Neil Fitz-
Patrick played a sufficiently
naive and Irish Daniel Brady;
Frank Gatliff was an amusing
and swaggering American Sam
Vanderberg; Glen Balmford
did well as Jane Oliver, and
Hugh McDermott, as the
horse-whipped editor, deserved
the abuse of the miners and
Miss Montez. No one person
in the cast stood out; none
failed.

Violin Concert!
Sydney’s Concerto Festival
wound-up with a concert of
high endeavor and achieve-
ment, with Polish violinist Ida
Haendel soloist in two of the
greatest essays in the form: the
Sibelius and the Beethoven.
Miss Haendel, a slight,, trim
.figure, wields her bow with
considerably less dynamism
than marked the playing of the
last great woman fiddler to visit
Sydney, the late Ginette Niveu ;
but her style is no less assured.
Any technique that can with-
stand the impact of the two
most exacting and vigorously
masculine concertos extant and
emerge without a dent in it —as
hers did —may lay confident
claim to completeness.
The Sibelius, with which
Miss Haendel began, makes
few concessions to the
executant. The orchestral back-
ground is massive, the moods
are varied, and the best in
lyricism and strongly-wrought
figuration work are demanded
from the soloist. Miss
Haendel quickly established
facile command of the
bounding energy which
marks the opening allegro, and
the vital rhythmic material
allotted her in the final section
was beautifully accented.
Whereas the Finn’s concerto
is far from characteristic of
his major works, Beethoven’s
is completely characteristic.
Cast in the same heroic mould
as the Fifth Piano Concerto
and the Fifth Symphony, its
performance stands or falls by
the treatment accorded the
extended opening movement.
Miss Haendel’s ornamentation
work here, her clear, sinewy
cadenzas, the well-sustained
mood of meditative serenity
captured in the larghetto, and
the pulsing lilt of the melody
of the closing rondo, added up
to a remarkable performance.
The orchestra under Sir
Bernard Heinze did solid work
ir both concertos, the con-
ductor’s tight hand assuring
that orchestral volume never
endangered the soloist an
ever-present hazard with these
two giants. The work of cellos
and bassoons in the second
subject of the first movement
of the Sibelius, and the upper
strings and reeds in the
Beethoven, stood out.
The orchestra’s own contribu-
tion, Siloti’s splendid modern
transcription of Vivaldi’s D
Minor Concerto (originally
composed for two violins and
figured bass), was given a read-
ing of most cheerful animation,
the robust theme flung gaily
from one set of strings to
another, and all working-up to
a climax of respectable weight.
“lolanthe”
Devotees of “G. and S.” are
prone to make fantastic claims
for their operettas, even going
so far as to describe them as
a kind of English equivalent to
Mozart comedy. Seeing them
for the first time since boyhood,
the present commentator was
struck by their resemblance,
when serious, to oratorio;
when comic and topical, to
music-hall.
Since the Victorian era
tended 10 divide its cultural
affections between those poles,
no wonder their success! One
wonders whether the promised
“liberation” from tradition (the
music is already freed) is likely
to prove a good thing, after
all. As they stand now, they
are period-pieces, but from a
great period in English history,
and a veneer of 20th-century
sophistication may well destroy
their main source of charm.
Sets for the present
“lolanthe” (at Her Majesty’s,
Brisbane) are precisely what
they set out to be: “English
countryside,” and Act 11,
“Great Palace Yard, West-
minster.” The Fairy Queen
must be an ageless dowager-
dame in the English manner,
and Evelyn Gardiner was just
this —as always.
Kenneth Tynan, once
lenfant terrible of English
critics, made a simple plea for
G. and S. shows. “There must
be comeliness and gingerness in
the women and charm and
freshness in the men.” As the
pastoral lovers, Roslyn Dunbar
and Kevin Foote, must have
been dispensed to Tynan’s

presence they were as bright as
a pair of butterflies—for the
future of musical comedy in
Australia one hopes that the
Firm has securely pinned them
down.
Perhaps it was simply a good
production, for, come to think
of it, Eric Thornton and
Terence O’Donoghue have
never been seen or heard to
better advantage.
In some fortunate shows
there occurs a moment which
goose-pimples its way into a
critic’s iron frame. Towards
the end of the show, lolanthe,
inviting her own death, sings
the ballad of her faithless,
mortal lover. Jane Martin’s
voice is normally of light,
soubrette calibre, but as her sad
story unfolded, it took on a
strange, tragic mezzo quality,
all half-shadows, unearthly. A
programme-note gave a clue to
this unforgettable experience—
“ She studied with Maggie
Teyte.” The great Melisande
would not have been ashamed
of her pupil.

Mary Troy
Holding her first exhibition
in Sydney at David Jones’,
Mary Troy is essentially an
amateur painter; and the
surprising thing is not how very
amateurish is the worst of her
work with its ill-drawn figures,
its sentimentality and naivety,
but how charming is the best of
it.
Even so ambitious a work as
the large historical pageant “In
the Days of Caroline
Chisholm,” despite some
blemishes among the figures,
has a tranquil spaciousness
that catches very well an aspect
of Sydney before we covered
it with flats and skyscrapers. It
is what you might call a
genuine “primitive”—and an
unusually sensitive one —and
had it survived as the master-
piece of some early colonial
painter would have been
valued very highly. It is still an
attractive piece of work and
should find a place in some
school or municipal gallery.
In general, though, it is when
she escapes from her figure-
paintings—often so pleasant in
their patterns of quiet color ;
nearly always marred by
sentimentality—that Miss Troy
is most rewarding: notably in
her flowerpieces, which are
clear and fresh, and more not-
ably still in a group of dark,

The disadvantage of most
contemporary formulas for art
is, of course, that everybody
can do them as well as every-
body else. Once you accept
abstract drawing and composi-
tion and paint as tacky as
sump-oil there really is no way
of saying how promising or
unpromising are the “44
promising young painters” at
the Terry Clune Galleries,
King’s Cross.
They may all be geniuses ;
but the only thing this com-
mentator can say with certitude
is that David Rae’s portrait of
a boy is reasonably well painted
and shows a feeling for
character; that Jocelyn
Maugham’s “Bushland” is an
honest and not unpleasing, if
not striking, attempt to cope
with the intricacies of its sub-
ject ; and that a lot of hard
work, for a tolerably pleasing
if conventional result, has
obviously gone into Margaret
Woodward’s “Mother and
Child.”

directing his gaze on the

A show of Chinese pottery,

Room, Collins Street, covers
10 centuries of the Chinese
potter’s art, and a lovely collec-

read that the present Govern-

plete embargo on the export
of any antique treasures, since
Chiang Kai-shek got away
with three shiploads when he
moved over to Formosa. It is
just as well it did. Modern
industrialisation isn’t likely to
have any different effect on the
. art of the Chinese potter from
what it has had on his Western
exemplar, and it will no doubt
be as impossible to find a
beautiful pot in China outside
the Peking Palace Museum as
it is to find one outside the
national museums or the private
collections of the wealthy in
Western countries.

“No Down Payment”
Considerable dramatic
impact and authentic charac-
terisation and atmosphere are
most useful attributes of this
story about the problems,
separate and interrelated, of
four young married couples in
a new housing-estate, all of
them living right up to or
beyond their means and lean-
ing heavily on hire-purchase
for luxuries and necessities. All
four men are hard-driven for
more money to satisfy too-
indulged wives or children, and
amorous jealousy adds a spark
to the explosive mixture.
The acting is excellent.
Joanne Woodward is com-
pletely natural as the free-and-
easy, rather irresponsible wife
of a war-hero who has an over-
weaning ambition to be a
police-chief; Sheree North
works up convincingly to a
good emotional pressure as the
long-suffering wife of a high-
voltage used-car salesman who
has a weakness for whisky and
nebulous schemes for making
his fortune but can’t pay his
debts. Tony Randall in this
role, and Cameron Mitchell, as
the war-hero who must get into
a uniform again so he can push
people around, are the best of
the men.

“The Silken Affair”
This polished and resource-
ful British comedy-farce assays
fairly high in laughs.
An accountant employed in
the City, bound for a dull day
of routine auditing of an old-
fashioned silk-stocking concern
whose affairs are getting into
a parlous state, shares a taxi
with a vivacious and flirtatious
French model. This sparks-off
rebellion and an urge to prove
himself the world’s greatest
accountant, an ambition he has
long secretly nourished. So he
“cooks” the ledgers, so cleverly
that both management and the
financial world are convinced
of the firm’s prosperity.
He then proceeds, in another
burst of mad-waggery, to
“downgrade” the ledgers of a
rival nylon firm, again so
successfully that the shares
plummet. A financial wizard,
a sort of elderly boy-friend of
the model, advises him to
burgle his rich wife's safe.
With the loot he does some
handy share - juggling and
eventually emerges with a
majority-interest in the two
concerns, the former owners
working under him.
It is all delightfully amoral,
and no doubt practising
accountants would pick a few
holes in the plot. The central
role is tailored-to-measure for
David Niven and his air of
lordly indifference to problems
which would have other men
chewing their nails down to
the quicks. Genevieve Page, as
the tempting French wench,
reveals a sparkling personality
and a fair flair for light comedy
—she overdoes her eye-work,
but they are a most expressive
pair of lamps. Good character-
studies are supplied by William
Hyde White, as the financial
wonder, and Ronald Squire, as
the genial silk-stocking fancier.

MORE "MESSIAH”
By PETER NICHOLLS
TT is interesting to compare
-* Adrian Wintle’s comments on
Handel’s “Messiah” with those
of Sir Edward Bairstow in his
monograph Handel’s Oratorjo
‘ The Messiah ’’ (Oxford Uni-
versity Press). On page 12 of
his book Bairstow states that
Arnold’s edition was full of
errors which were not corrected
until Prout’s arrangement of
1902, referred to by Mr. Wintle
in column three of his account.
With all due respect, it is sug-
gested that Mr. Wintle’s
authority (Dr. Dalley-Scarlett)
cannot claim to enjoy world-
recognition to the same extent
as Sir Edward Bairstow, and
among “those who know” there
is substantial doubt even upon
such fundamental issues as the
authenticity or otherwise of one
of the most highly revered
editions.
The raison d’etre of the
newly instituted performances
in Brisbane and other cities in
Australia and overseas is at
least questionable, and Arnold’s
orchestration may be just
another futile attempt to realise
Handel’s wishes in the modern
concert-hall.
Nobody will deny that the
main object of any “Messiah,”
mangled or not, is to reproduce
to the audience as faithfully as
possible under the prevailing
circumstances the sounds heard
by those in the Fishamble
Street Music Hall, Dublin, on
April 13, 1742. To this
primary function are generally
added such cruder considera-
tions as that the concert must
show a profit, which is tanta-
mount to saying that the largest
possible number of people must
be allowed to hear the one per-
formance.
Most managers draw an
admirable compromise by
using an edition such as that
of Mozart or Prout which
modifies the orchestral score
so as to produce a logical and
uniform overall amplification
appropriate to a large hall.
In the first performance of
this oratorio, Handel’s
orchestra was nearly twice as
large as the choir, and it is
therefore reasonable to suppose
that he considered such an
apparently large foundation
necessary to support the chorus.
Modern advocates of the
“enlightened” style, however,
refuse to be hampered by such
trammels. In Melbourne last
December two performances
of the Arnold edition used a
chorus approximately three
times the size of the orchestra ;
that is, in proportion, six times
as large as the composer would
have had it, and from Mr.
Wintle’s account it may be
gathered that the conditions in
Brisbane were almost as
grotesque.
Early performances, however,
differed from their modern
counterparts in an aspect even
more fundamental than the size
of the auditorium and relative
proportions of singers and
players. The 18th - century
oratorio conductor directed the
music from a harpsichord on
which it was his duty to im-
provise a continuo or free
accompaniment. In this task
he was guided by a “figured
bass,” being a kind of musical
shorthand defining the
harmonic progression at any
point of the score. The continuo
therefore had substantial free-
dom as has a ship in a wide
channel, whereas the other
instrumentalists were merely
trains kept strictly on the rails
by their respective parts fully
set out in the score. It will thus
be readily understood that the
artistic continuo was a highly
skilled piece of musicianship
which many consider today to
be a lost art.
The harpsichord is an
instrument of abnormally soft
and refined intonation; con-
sequently it is usually found
that large auditoria engulf its
sound. Today, also, the
harpsichordist, far from being
the leader, is but a cog in the
Arnold machine and the con-
ductor perched remotely on his
pedestal will certainly frown
upon any extemporaneous
liberties, even if taken artisti-
cally and competently, for the
simple reason that it is the
duty of an independent con-
ductor to direct, and the harpsi-
chordist must play the notes in
his score and generally do as
he is told.
The century - and -a - half
following Handel’s death saw
the rise of the large-scale con-
cert, and Mozart was one of
those who saw the difficulties of
slavishly following the auto-
graph score in a hall of the
size rapidly becoming fashion-
able. This composer, although
in early childhood the epitome
of precocity, is recorded to
have been modesty to the point
of diffidence itself in later years,
and therefore we have no
reason to believe, as Mr. Wintle
suggests, that he thought Handel
per se unequal to the occasion.
Mozart’s aim was to let the
audience hear a continuo as
might have been played by
Handel on the harpsichord at
a smaller concert, and in doing
so he does not dispense with
this instrument altogether, as
is understood by many Arnold
disciples ; it is regarded as an
optional and desirable medium
for the accompaniment of
certain passages not played by
the orchestra, especially the
recitatives.
It need not be deemed the
height of presumption on the
parts of Mozart and Prout to
orchestrate in the Handelian
style. Few of those who think
so have any alternative to
suggest, except the critics, who
could do better themselves
presumably. Poor Mozart is
considered entirely ignorant of
the counterpoint which is a
compulsory achievement of any
music student in a worth-while
music-school!
Thus can Sullivan write
Handelian music which experts
regard as indistinguishable from
the real thing and which will
be the delight of theatregoers
for mjmy years. If Sullivan,
how much more Mozart? Mr.
Wintle’s authority in Brisbane
calls Mozart’s additions “a
dreadful agglomeration of
oboes and horns.” That this is
a matter of opinion only is
emphasised by Sir Edward
Bairstow (lac. cit. pp. 14, 15):
“In his accompaniments we
have... .melodious counter-
points written by a great
master. These are played on
instruments of varied and
beautiful tone-color, blending
together as parts of the whole
orchestra, and not standing
aloof as either harpsichord,
organ or piano must inevitably
d 0... .These harmonies are so
beautiful that it would be a
thousand pities to sacrifice
them as some purists would
have us do.”
In the final analysis one
cannot help but conclude that
the aversion to Prout’s edition
in particular is a direct conse-
quence of the supercilious
attitude it is now the fashion
to adopt among our musical
leaders who smugly identify
themselves with the Renaissance
of music from the dark ages of
the Victorian era. Such a
superiority complex may be
justified in circumstances in
which we possess knowledge
not available in those times.
Such a field is early Spanish
keyboard music. The musi-
cology of Handel’s “Messiah”
does not enter this category,

LOSING ground for the third succes-
sive year, the big A.E.I. group gave
a rather unimpressive display last term,
net profit barely covering the unchanged
p.c. div.
Scrip in the holding-co., A.E.1., Ltd.,
was in demand as a promising “growth”
stock during the year, buyers offering up
to 325. for the f.-p. £1 ords., but, with a
16 p.c. drop in net earnings suggesting
a somewhat slower rate of growth than
that anticipated, sales were made last
week at 255. to give a yield of £6 p.c. from
a If p.c. div. Consolidated accounts at
October 31 last give the scrip a net
tangible cover of 235.
The chief operating member of the
group, Australian Electrical Industries
Pty. (formerly known as Australian
General Electric Pty.), was formed in
1931 to merge the Australian interests
of both General Electric Co. of New
York and an English co. now known as
Associated Electrical Industries, Ltd. In
1955 General Electric sold its 50 p.c.
interest in Australian Electrical Indus-
tries to the English parent, which in turn
passed over the business to the then
wholly-owned subsidiary, A.E.1., Ltd., in
exchange for the co.'s £4,000,000 paid
capital. Later in the same year Associ-
ated Electrical Industries offered approxi-
mately a quarter of its holding in A.E.I.
to the public, asking 20s. 4d. for each of
the 1,050,000 £1 ords. covered by the
offer.
(Associated Electrical Industries is,
itself, owned by a number of leading
U.K. electrical engineers and manu-
facturers including Metropolitan-Vickers
Electrical Co., British Thompson-
Houston Co. and Edison Swan Electric
Co.)
The extensive range of products
manufactured or distributed by the
A.E.I. group stretches from generating
equipment, transformers, switchgear and
diesel-electric locos, to electric - light
globes, household appliances and tele-
vision-receivers, the last-named item
being turned out by an associate co.,
Ediswan-Ekco (Aust.) Pty. Principal
manufacturing-centres are at Auburn
(Sydney) aud Richmond (Melbourne),
but other plants in the eastern States
and in South Australia also help to
supply an Australia-wide market.
Several large contracts were obtained
during the year to October 31 last (includ-
ing one worth £5,500,000 for the supply
of generating equipment), but strong
competition and rising costs kept earn-
ings down. Results in the first four
months of the term were described as
“very disappointing” by the board, and
earnings in the first six months of the
year failed to reach the amount needed
for the 3| p.c. interim div.
Although the group fared a tittle better
in the second half of the term, the final
reckoning showed net profit down by
£59,566 at £307,666 after allowing for the
proportion attributable to outside
interests and providing £210,904 (down
£86,525) for taxation and £166,264 (up
£55,518) for depreciation. Relief from
loan-interest amounting to £26,000 was
granted by the parent co., while expendi-
ture incurred in re-designing a number of
‘ products (£40,577) and an additional
provision for long-service leave (£20,750)
were charged against reserves:

parent and associated cos., the group is
financing a big expansion-and-moderni-
sation programme with advances from
these cos., receiving a further £1,416,375
last term to bring total advances up to
£3,058,508:

A large property was bought at Rose-
bery (Sydney) during the year and a new
transformer-factory opened near Bris-
bane, the outlay on fixed assets exceed-
ing £700,000. Stocks, up £901,696 or 24
p.c., appear to have banked-up, when
compared with a £241,954 drop in book-
debts, and, with the parent pumping in
additional funds, the surplus of current
assets over current liabilities rose by
£555,934 to £5,966,212.
Reporting some improvement in
trading conditions to last week’s annual
meeting, the chairman (Sir Jack Stevens)
forecast “a reasonable trading profit” in
the current term, with a larger pro-
portion of the loan-capital producing
income and internal reorganisation lead-
ing to greater operating efficiency.
The practice of paying interim divs. at
half the rate of the total div. is to be dis-
continued, and the next interim (normally
paid in July) won’t exceed 2\ p.c.
. However, this rate “is not to be


regarded as any indication of the final
distribution.”
Tooheys, Ltd.
PRESENTING the Little Budget in
March, 1956, Prime Minister
Menzies forecast that no significant
reduction in overall beer-consumption
would follow the proposed excise-sting
of an additional 30d. a gallon; and
latest returns show this prophecy to have
been well founded.
Down only seven-million gallons on
the previous year, gross production
(including waste) in 1956-57 was 226-
million gallons, with present trends
indicating a probable slight upswing for
the current term. On a per capita basis,
however, the national tipple shows signs
of slackening off, the average Australian
downing a mere 22.9 gallons last year,
compared with his record intake of 24.3
gallons in 1954-55.
For Tooheys, the N.S.W. brewer, it
was an auspicious year. Reinforced by
the superimposition with which the
breweries capped the Federal impost,
together with the relative stability of
wage-levels and a steadily advancing
turnover, visible net profit jumped
smartly by £28,039, a record £350,673
being claimed after deducting an
unstated tax-provision and setting aside
£228,164 for depreciation (apparently on
plant only) which was calculated as
usual at rates which are “in excess of those
allowable for taxation”:

rate took £311,850 of the earnings, and

Even after the writing-up of hotel-
properties in 1954-55 —Tooheys controls
about 300 in all, mostly freeholds —this
item at £4,671,584 (up £461,458) appears
to be at a low valuation, emphasised in
comparison with pre-war fixed assets,
£3,195,395 being shown under this head-
ing in 1939. Nor are any exaggerated
claims made regarding the value of
brewery property, which, mainly as a
result of the new building project at
Auburn, N.S.W., has more than doubled
in book-value since 1954.
Officially opened during the term, the
new brewery is now on a partfy-
operational basis. Brewing, for the
present, is carried on in the old premises
near the Sydney Central Station, and the
beer conveyed to Auburn in tankers for
bottling.
Following a call of ss. in January,
1957, the 6 p.c. unsecured registered
note-issue is now fully paid-up. It
remains to be seen what Tooheys’ divi-
dend policy will be on the enlarged share-
capital when the 20s. notes, amounting to
£2,338,875, are converted at par to 20s.
ords. in January, 1962.
Latterly in N.S.W., the United Licensed
Victuallers have been engaged on some
soul-searching to explain the loss of
custom to the many clubs which have
sprung up over the post-war period, and
no doubt political pressure will be
brought to bear in favor of Hoteliers. In
this faction-fight, the breweries appear to
be in somewhat of a dilemma, for while
lease-premiums have, perhaps, suffered,
clubs have undoubtedly enhanced the
breweries’ sales-potential. Of course,
the clubs represent a latent but very
real threat to the hitherto unassailable
monopoly-power inherent in the tied-
house system.
Slightly cautious in its approach to
Tooheys’ scrip, the sharemarket prices
the ords. at 245. 9d., at Which price they
would yield £6 9s. 3d. on the present
dividend-scale. The notes changed haftds
recently at 21s. 3d., yield being £5 12s. lid.
A very conservative 275. 9d. was shown
as the net tangible asset backing on each
share at last balance-date (July 31, 1957).
Regent Motors (Holdings), Ltd.
/"YNE of the three Australian cos. to
obtain a direct interest in the local
manufacture of Volkswagen vehicles,
Regent Motors (Holdings), Ltd., has
already found the distribution of the
popular German-designed car a particu-
larly profitable occupation.
Formed in Melbourne just on seven
years ago, Regent Motors (Holdings)
issued 240,000 10s. ords. to an estab-
lished proprietary co. of similar name in
exchange for that co.’s £15,000 paid
capital, offering a further 200,000 10s.
ords. to the public, at par, in April, 1951.
A later private issue of 7000 ords. lifted
paid capital to its present total of
£223,500.
Highly successful as Victorian and Tas-
manian distributor of Rover and Land/
Rover vehicles, Regent Motors added the
Australian franchise for Volkswagen cars
and trucks to its other agencies in 1954,
undertaking the retail distribution of
these vehicles in Victoria and Tasmania.
The holding-co. operates through four
wholly - owned subsidiaries, Regent
Motors Pty. (Rover and Land/Rover),
Spencer Motors Pty. (Volkswagen),
Volkswagen Distributors Pty. (Volks*
wagen franchise, Australia) and Lion
Motors Pty., formerly Monteath Pipe
and Foundry Co. Pty. (Volkswagen
industrial engines).
The co.’s share-interest in Volkswagen
(A/asia), Ltd., which was formed recently
to manufacture the Volkswagen range,
has yet to be announced, but it is expected
to amount to at least 12} p.c. of the new
co.’s paid capital. (The German parent
co. will put up 51 p.c. of the paid capital
and L.N.C. Industries, Ltd., Sydney dis-
tributor of Rover and Volkswagen
vehicles, 12} p.c., with the remaining
36} p.c. coming, in as yet unspecified
proportions, from Clyde Industries, Ltd.,
and Regent Motors.)
Affected by anti-inflationary measures
and import-restrictions in the 1952 and
1953 terms, group earnings have since
climbed at a spectacular rate, rising from
14.9 p.c. on share-capital in 1953 to 61.7
p.c. in 1955 and ty 112.3 p.c. last term.
Over the same period the div.-rate in-
creased (in annual lifts) from 10 p.c. to
22} p.c., to give an average rate of 15.7
p.c. since formation of the co.
Import-restrictions limited the supply
of Rover cars (imported in “built-up”
condition) over the last financial year,
but, throughout Australia, the locally-
assembled Volkswagen accounted for a
fraction over 7 p.c. of all new-car regis-
trations, compared with 4.5 p.c. of a
slightly higher total in the previous year.
Reflecting this trend, consolidated
accounts covering the year to June 30 last
show net earnings £33,149 higher at
£251,099, after charging £44,066 to
tooling-absorption and providing £190,000
(up £14,000) for taxation and £16,371
(down £7237) for depreciation and amor-
tisation :

For several years stocks (up
£320,255) and creditors (up
£401,437) have been the two
largest items in the balance-
sheet and, at the end of last
term (subject to current
liabilities being a little less
“current” than they appear), the
ratio of current assets to
current liabilities was rather
tight at 1,2 to 1.
Although sales of Rover cars
and, to a lesser extent, Land/
Rover vehicles have declined
over the past year, success in
the current term is indicated by
the latest registration figures,
which show that distributors of
Volkswagen products (the co.’s
chief profit-winners) are hold-
ing, and even increasing, their
share of the new-car market.
Until details of franchise
arrangements and the share-
holding in Volkswagen
(A/asia) are published, the
extent to which Regent Motors
will benefit from its association
with the nqw co. remains a
matter for conjecture.
Anticipating future benefits
and the possible need for addi-
tional capital, the sharemarket
prices the scrip accordingly, the
f.-p. 10s. ords. returning
£5 10s. sd. p.c. from a 22J p.c.
div. at 40s. 9d. Consolidated

280,000 ss. ords. at par (one-
for-four), while £150,000 was
raised by the issue of 7 p.c.

Sydney, on which the co. pro-
poses to erect a six - story
office-block and warehouse,
was extended last term by the
purchase of an adjoining
property, and demolition-work,
in preparation for the new
building, is now complete.
While retaining its connec-
tions with the mining industry
(the co.’s largest customer early
in the century), H. B. Selby now
derives a large part of its
income from the sale of equip-
ment to industrial laboratories,
schools and universities.
Import-restrictions have limited
activities in some directions, but,
as many of the lines handled
are turned-out by local manu-
facturers, including Analite, the
effect on turnover hasn’t been
serious.
Although all branches
reported an increase in sales
last term (to June 30, 1957),
higher operating costs (particu-
larly wages and salaries) made-*
off with the extra revenue, and,
with funds raised during the
year making no significant con-
tribution to earnings, lower
provisions for taxation (down
£3850 at £28,942) and deprecia-
tion (down £853 at £6254) more
than accounted for the £2374
improvement in net profit:

their liking than the previous
proposals (outlined in The
Bulletin of 18/12/’57).
Under the new scheme
A.O.E. will sell its 35 p.c. hold-
ing in Mary Kathleen Uranium,

retain all other assets.
To finance the purchase,
M. wilk'offer A.O.E. share-
holders 15 shares of ss. each at
par and 10 free shares for every
100 shares held in the older co.
Existing shareholders can
thus retain 40 p.c. of their
interest in the Mary Kathleen
Uranium venture without cost
to themselves, compared with
approximately 21 p.c. under the
previous arrangement (which
made no provision for the sale
of “rights”), and at the same
time receive some compensa-
tion for their partial loss by the
sale of rights to the cash issue.
Shareholders wishing to
maintain their equity' in the
co.’s assets will find the cost
unchanged, at 755. per 100
A.O.E. shares, but scrip issued
for cash will now account for
a smaller proportion of the'new
co.’s paid capital.

cost of Bs. 3d. each.

ence with M.K.1., as the main
shareholder, participating in
any return from the co.’s rutile
interests.

From Herbert Holman
or later things will
have to come to a head on
the wages front. But, despite the
activity and events of the past
few weeks, there are as yet
no positive signs that the
U.K. Government is in full con-
trol of the situation.
Mr. Frank Cousins, it is true,,
has averted a strike or other
“industrial action” by subduing
the hotheads and persuading
the busmen to go to arbitra-
tion. It is a welcome gesture
but hardly abounding in good-
will, for, in the first place, the
authority is to be the Industrial
Court, whose decisions are
binding on neither party, and
not the Industrial Disputes
Tribunal, whose awards are
enforceable at law; and, in
the second place, he has intro-
duced an escape-clause which
reserves the right for the bus-
men to take other action if
arbitration fails to provide a
“fair expression of opinion on
the rightness of their claim” —
whatever that may mean. Pre-
sumably it is a mild hint to the
arbitrators to be generous, or
else.
Meanwhile, the Minister- of
Labor, effecting the seeming
transition from conciliation at
all costs to firmness and no
nonsense, has been appealing
for a new look, on the part of
all concerned, at our antique
machinery of industrial rela-
tions. He has also stood up
to Mr. Cousins, refusing to
appoint a committee of inquiry
into the London busmen’s
dispute (but offering to con-
sider one on a national basis).
Jockeying
The situation generally would
seem to be of small gains and
extensive jockeying for position.
So far the gains are mostly
Mr. Cousins’s, whose realistic
but clever manoeuvring has, in
the opinion of some observers,
driven the Government to the
corner of the board.
This view underrates the
ability, both tactical and
strategic, of the Minister of
Labor. He, like Mr. Cousins,
is becoming increasingly sensi-
tive to public opinion but in a
very different way. The public
is unsympathetic towards
“industrial action,” militant
trade-unionists and the like.
Mr. Cousins knows this. A
bus-strike would not only
alienate the public but would
also be disastrous for union
funds. It would also jeopardise
Labor’s electoral chances.
Mr. Macleod’s policy, on the
other hand, seems to be to
make an ally of public opinion.
This can come about in two
ways: directly, through the
medium of the speech, and
indirectly, but not less
vigorously, through the over-
playing by the unions of a too-
aggressive hand.
Why, for instance, did the
Government make its pointed
(and now notorious) appeal to
arbitration tribunals to bear in
mind the nation’s economic
circumstances when deciding
over wage-claims? Surely such
considerations are automatic.
Was not the idea to acquaint
the public?
Moreover, the Government
has a coup available that is
much more potent than the
subtle defensive play of the
union-bosses. It could, if
large-scale industrial irrespon-
sibility happened to coincide
with the present emergency, go
to the country, and, no doubt,
sweep the polls.
There is no reason at all to
believe that the Conservatives
will use this weapon or, indeed,
that they are particularly con-
scious of it. But Labor is, and
that accounts for the current
restraint and its underlying
fears.
Cam-shaft
There must be something in
the curriculum, if not in the air,
at Cambridge which is con-
ducive to light entertainment.
Names that come to mind are
lan Hay, Anthony Armstrong,
Noel Gay, Jack Hulbert, Eric
Maschwitz, A. A. Milne, C. K.
Munro and George Posford.
Oxford, though more produc-
tive of dramatists, actors and
producers, is quite out of the
picture.
Even .more remarkable is the
post-war transition of the
Cambridge “Footlights” Club
from gentlemanly dabbling to
unashamed professionalism. At
least three successful West End
song-and-dance shows origi-
nated in this club. And now
another, “Lady at the Wheel,”
has reached the Lyric, Hammer-
smith.
There is certainly nothing
amateurish about it. Every-
thing has been livened-up ; the
incident by our best-known
choreographer - producer, the
music by an orchestrator and
the performance by meticulous
casting ; a vocal quartet rein-
forces the numbers and a band
loud enough for the nearby
Palais de Danse on a Saturday
night supersedes the usual
shoestring make-do of two
pianos and drums.
That is to say, all the con-
siderable expertise of show-
business has been marshalled,
drilled and unloosed with the
objective of boosting the show
and taking no chances to
prejudice its success. Nothing
wrong with that, of course.
The show is lively, energetic
and pleasant and it merits
success. But, though the origin
is Cambridge, the derivation is
patently Yale and Harvard, in
so far as Cole Porter owes his
talents to those academies.
Some of the lyrics, in fact,
come near to paraphrase. (Since
most young lyricists—Oscar
Hammerstein II is a dis-
tinguished example—begin by
imitating established models,
this is not necessarily a fault;
Given prestige in the theatre,
they can then be more indi-
vidual.)
At times Wendy Toye’s
livening-up is apt, like a three-
ring circus, to be overfull and
distracting; and her well-
disciplined team might seem
more natural under a slacker
rein. Maggie , Fitz Gibbon,
avoiding the conventional
ingenue, is neutral in her acting
but puts over her songs well.
Peter Gilmore is a splendidly
manly juvenile. Lucille Mapp’s
bewitching Jamaican oomph is
fetching but inflexible as its
derivation, cabaret. Vivienne
Bennett’s frippery matron
(English as Budleigh Salterton)
is certainly flexible, even within
its ridiculously narrow limits,
but then one who has played
innumerable Shakspearian roles
between Puck and Lady
Macbeth can’t help but learn
how to act. Of the necessarily,
less-experienced players, only
Bernard Cribbins, as a hulking
South American * tippler-
philanderer, is outstanding; he
is lucky, perhaps, since the part
is a godsend and his show-
stopping number, “Siesta,” is a
good one ; but he is a natural
comic with a fine sense of
timing.


BULLS
By DOUGLAS STEWART
ON one bank of the
Kapuni there was a
roaring great Jersey
bull, tawny as a lion,
pawing up the grass and goug-
ing his horns into the earth ;
and on the other bank of the
Kapuni there was another roar-
ing great Jersey bull doing the
same thing; and between these
monsters, as they bellowed
defiance at each other across
the water, floated, apparently
disembodied, a human head
and an arm holding high a
fishing-rod. Propelled by some
unseen force the head and the
arm moved steadily and noise-
lessly upstream.
It was no more than my
friend Fin Maslin taking a
ducking in preference to taking
on a bull —and how delicately
he trod through that commo-
tion, walking on the slippery
boulders as if on eggs!—but
it has always seemed to me the
perfect image of the enliven-
ment of our fishing in Taranaki
which those Jersey bulls pro-
vkled.
It was dairying country, and
I suppose the bulls had every
right to be there. Jerseys—the
gentle, fawn-colored cows, that
is ; graceful as deer —give the
richest cream. But even cows
graceful as deer must have
husbands, and every green farm
through which we passed was
guarded by one at least of these
murderous brutes, lord of fifty
acres and fifty wives.
Oddly enough, it was a cow—
but I think she was a Friesian ;
and of course she must have
had a calf to protect—who first
introduced me to the pleasures
of the chase,
That was so far back into
childhood that most of the
details are misty. It was out at
Mrs. Barr’s place, wherever
t h a t may have been, and all
j remember of Mrs. Barr is that
s he gave us buttermilk to drink,
a strange sour substance which
j t hi n k we enjoyed for its
oddity ; that she made the most
marvellous plump round ginger-
nuts, resembling in miniature
the genial rotundities of her
figure, and that she saved my
fif e> did Mrs. Barr, or truly may
have.

was a cow ’ too—or so we
thought; not caring to take
too c^ose a l°pk at it which
gave Fin Maslin and myself a
Ver Y Phasing burst of excite-
nient one night on the Kapuni
again. We saw it first, running
purposefully towards us, on the
plateau above the stream as
we were making our way home
to the car in the dusk. We
hl]rripd down the steen track
hu *7 ied d ° w, J f- he stee P track
“d paused at the-water s edge,
U™king that was that. Then
we saw the beast, tail out stiff
and running like mad, out-
lined against the skyline on the
ridge.
It plunged down the slope
and we plunged wildly across
the river ; and, wet and breath-
less, stood on the far bank
rocking with uncontrollable
laughter. It always seems exces-
sively funny to have been
chased by a cow, once you are
safe. Then we heard splash-
splash-splash across the ford,
splash-splash-splash through
the darkness. The thing was
dashing across the river after
us, and we bolted.
But it was rarely that we
were put to the shame of flee-
ing from mere cows. Whether
in boyhood or in manhood,
fishing the secret dark waters
of Lake Rotokare for eels or
wading the streams for trout, it
was the bulls that were the
menace, and sent us tearing
across the paddocks, plunging
through the waters, shinning up
Taranaki’s übiquitous pine-
trees, or, on one disgraceful
occasion when I was fishing
the Awakino at Mahoenui,
clambering desperately up a
cliff into the tutu-scrub, where
I hung from the thin branches
above the water like a high-
wayman from a gibbet.
I confess with shame that it
was only a Hereford bull,
massive as a mastodon but the
sleepiest and gentlest of
creatures, that made me, that
memorable day, leap instantly
into deep water, flounder across
the river and, breaking the tip
of my rod, fly so absurdly into
the tree-tops. True, its colossal
red-and-white head manifested
itself suddenly and appallingly
out of the clear sky over the
bank behind me; true, as
startled to stumble on a fisher-
man as I was to be stumbled on
by a bull, it woofed at me in
the most astonishing manner;
but watching with mild surprise
my antics in the water, it never
moved a foot to follow me, and
the only real excuse I can offer
for such an exhibition of
cowardice was that I had been
so conditioned by the Jerseys
that no bull could woof at me
and leave me unmoved.
FROM the boyhood excur-
sions to Lake Rotokare,
which lurked in its green woods
about eight miles out of Eltham,
draining the black waters of the
Ngaere Swamp, memory pre-
serves one supremely ridiculous
picture of two small boys up a
dead pine-sapling ; a foul and
rumbling monster of a Jersey
heaving his shoulder against
the pine to see if he could
push it down which he
possibly could have, for the
thing ifras both slender and
rotten, and why we did not
shin up the sound tree next to
it I know not —and Des Carter,
with his pale-blue prominent
eyes flashing with determina-
tion and his pocket-knife
murderously opened, vowing
with the utmost insincerity that
he would that very moment
drop from our perch on to the
bull’s back and ride it away,
stabbing it to death as he went.
I don’t think I quite believed
him even then ; but with that
marvellous capacity which boys
have for persuading themselves,
in the interests of drama, that
they do believe what they don’t,
I took Desmond very seriously
indeed and begged him with
feverish anxiety—perched there
in our tree by the roadside,
with the bull rumbling and
heaving like a volcano a few
feet below us and his bored
cows grazing round him—not
to sacrifice his life to save me.
But Des would ; he would ;
any moment now he would
drop with his deadly pocket-
knife ready ; he was going, he
was off . . . until after about an
hour of this magnificently
dramatic situation —or it may
have been ten minutes the
bull itself, just in time to save
its own life, moved off.
Was it on a single day, on
another of our eeling excur-
sions to Lake Rotokare, that we
enjoyed two vastly alarming
adventures, one with a bull and
the other with a “coffin” ; or
has memory telescoped two
days in one? It seems too much
exalted living to have packed
into one day, and yet so it
seems to have happened.-
Jhere were, with Des Carter


and myself that day, two or
maybe three of the sturdy,
nuggety small sons of Mr.
Walker the saddler, at whose
shop with its wonderful array
of saddles and bridles and
winkers and ingeniously plaited
stockwhips we always lingered
long on our way to school,
Happily all morning, though
perhaps even then a little dis-
concerted by the size and
numbers of our catch, for the
dark lake swarmed with the
most enormous eels, Des and
I and Albert and Sam and (if
he was there) young Charlie
fished away the hours. But
what a sinister place Lake
Rotokare was: shut in by its
sombre bush, black with the
ichor of the swamps, miles
away from all habitation,
studded and patrolled by
strange green floating islands of
logs and weed and moss which
walked with the wind across
the water.
The big, slimy black eels,
writhing in their serpentine
coi,s upon the grass were too
much like the embodied spirit
of the place, the demon that
lurked in the bush and under
the floating islands, to be hauled
out, however exciting was the
fishing, without some tinge of
dismay.
In the afternoon we began
to explore the bush ; and there,
deep in the dark-green silence
where the supplejacks twisted
from the branches and the tree-
ferns spread their great wings,
we came upon a thing which
to this day puzzles me: though
not now with such sinister
import. It was a kind of
culvert, made of thick slabs of
timber, like a long box, like a
coffin, with just the brown,
half-rotten top of it showing
through the black leaf-mould,
A most intriguing object.
What could it be for? What
was in it? When poking with
sticks, we contrived to make an
opening in the rotted slab at
one end, we scraped out ashes
and bones.
All I can think of today by
which to explain it is that it
must have been some kind of
Maori oven—though I never
heard of the Maoris covering
their earth-ovens with boards.
I don’t know what it could
have been. But as soon as we
found the ashes and charred
fragments of bone we per-
suaded ourselves, by the most
cogent arguments, frightening
our wits out in the process, that
somebody had burnt a body in
st And at that moment, so
it seems, a wind howled
through the trees, thunder-
clouds swarmed over us, and
rain began to fall. Hounded
demons we fled, and never
stopped running till we reached
“a^cassls^
hawkSi very comforting for
some obscure reason, hung
\yith widespread wings and a
delicious stink of carrion, along
*i ie barbed-wire fence,
T 7 | NLESS the storm was
very quickly over, it must
after all have been on another
day that we met the bull. For
ii was a fine sunny afternoon
when he roared on the grassy
lane that led through the hills
to the road, barring our way
home.
He was rcally in a rage> that
f e ii ow; pawing the earth,
gouging it with the horns, his
f ur j ous bellowing rising to a
S cream that echoed in all the
hills round the lake ; and when
we had crept close enough for
him to see us, he came run-
ning straight at us with that
low, intense, terrifying rumble
that betokens murder.
We scattered. Four of us,,
flying like birds before a gale, =
found ourselves eventually
perched breathless on the ridge-
top to the left of the lane;
and from there looked down
upon the appalling spectacle of
Albert Walker, the eldest of his
tribe, streaking along the track,
back the way we had come,
with the bull pounding after
him.
Even as we watched, Albert
rolled like a pudding under the
fence to comparative safety.
But our troubles were not yet
over, for it was the right-hand
fence he had taken and now he
was galloping full-tilt down-
hill towards the wild bush and
the lake. There was a strong
family-feeling among the
Walkers. Charlie was sobbing.
Sam was moaning, over and
over again, “Me brother
Albert! Me brother Albert!
Me brother Albert . . .”
I forget how we retrieved the
fugitive and by what devious
route over the ridges and far
away from the bull we eventu-
ally escaped to the road; but
years afterwards, so I was told,
the Walkers similarly got
separated when they were fight-
ing side by side in Crete and
(“Me brother Albert! Me
brother Albert!”) I was glad
indeed to learn that the elder
brother turned up safe, once
again, in the end.
these hair-
raising adventures I really
am tempted to forgive myself
for breaking my rod-tip on the
Awakino and for a certain
trepidation that still assails me
when anything, while I am out
fishing, makes a noise remotely
resembling a bull . . . though I
should not like anyone else to
have been present that hot, hot
day on the Duckmaloi, round
the long lonely bend past
Gearon’s, when, treading on an
imaginary snake at every step
to begin with, I heard the most
ominous bellowings in the bush
on the mountainside across the
river.
Naturally I moved on. The
bellowing moved on, too. For-
getting about the snakes, I did
a quick hundred-yards through
the scrub, and fished a little
more. The bellowing caught up
to me. I did another fifty-
yards to a convenient tree ; the
bellowing kept pace with me.
Another fifty-yards to another
tree; still the bellowing
followed. Another fifty-yards,
sweating, panting, pursued by
all the bellowings of hell, all
the worse for being invisible.
It was, alas, Mr. Gearon
droving his cattle home around
the mountainside; the most
harmless of Black Poll steers,
not even accompanied by the
old bull who, hobbled with
chains, used to clank along the
river there like a large and
sorrowful ghost. Let a veil be
drawn.
But they were not, in Tara-
naki, so harmless. The two
most perilous specimens I ever
encountered out fishing were a
Jersey on the Tangarakau and
another Jersey—not that mild
old Hereford —on the Awakino.
He was a very baffled bull, that
brute on the Tangarakau, and
he did what I thought no bull
would ever do —dived into the
river and swam after us like
a mad hippopotamus.
Fin Maslin was with me that
day, fishing under the willows
where the stream, so rich in
goodly brown trout, seldom

Snapping Bardy
By J. C. SHELLEY
CROOKED MICK was a
member of the Shire
Council when that body
decided to extend elec-
tricity into the Brown’s Road
area. For many years there
had been agitation and depu-
tations from the Brown’s Road
people for this amenity, and it
w'as on this platform that
Crooked Mick had been elected
a councillor.
After the meeting Crooked
Mick drove out to Bardy’s with
the good news. Brown’s Road
angled off the Gnashing Teeth
Mountain road north-west of
Stillman’s crossing. Mick
turned off the main road and
bumped and lurched along the
track that served the settlers
here.
Bardy’s place was about half-
a-mile up the road. The house,
vertical slabs with strips of tin
nailed over the cracks between
the slabs and a disheartened-
looking iron roof with sagging,
rusted gutters and a leaning
water-tank or two, was hard
on the left-hand side of the
road. One stepped off the back-
veranda straight on to the road,
while across the road from the
house was a big ramshackle
shed where Bardy kept things
that “might come in useful later
on.”
This shed was also used to
store machinery, a bit of a
work-bench, the dogs and the
fowls, and any other odds-and-
ends.
Brown’s Road narrowed and
hurried between these buildings,
twisted, turned and bucked its
way for a couple of further
miles. The Howards, O’Tooles
and Rex Brost lived beyond
Bardy; Brost being the
furthest up, right at the top of
the road where the shadow of
the Gnashing Teeth Mountain
fell heaviest.
Mrs. Bardy was big and
useful-looking. When she
laughed every inch of her
enjoyed the joke. There were
no sons because “the Missus
hasn’t had enough experience.”
But there were four daughters,
well spaced along the years of
her two decades of marriage to
Bardy. The eldest girl was
Maud, who would be much like
her mother in another twenty
years. Bardy often said of his
daughter, “She’s as good as a
man and a boy around the
place, providing she gets out of
bed on the right side. But if she
gets out on the wrong side,
then she can be as cantankerous
as a mule.”
Maud was a bit over seven-
teen and inclined to be boy-
happy, particularly when young
Ken Brost was about. There
were days when the sun shone
from Ken and there were days
when she despised him.
Between Bardy and Brost
was an enmity going back over
the years, the source of which
had long been lost in the past.
Brost was one of those thin
little men who savor lifeTo the
last bitter pip. Bardy took life
as it came and was partial to a
joke, particularly if it Was
against someone he was not
keen on, like Brost. Over
Brest’s head Bardy kept a con-
tinual threat of violence, his
idea of humor. When Brost
angered him Bardy would let it
be known among the neighbors
what he would do to “that
coot.”
Brost would dwell on this for
a week or two and then go to
town to see his solicitor. Brost
had never done anything in his
life that wasn’t legal: “I’ll get
the legal aspect on that,” he’d
say. By the time Brost had
made up his mind to go in and
see his solicitor his family of six
would be properly keyed-up.
To get to town they had to
pass through Bardy’s bottle-
neck and, sure enough, there’d
be Bardy carelessly brandish-
ing his shotgun and mouthing
threats.
A couple of times the
sergeant had come out and
spoken to Bardy about the way
he handled that gun. Bardy
had been indignant. “Stone the
galahs, a bloke’s got a right to
shoot crows on his own place,
hasn’t he?” He had produced
the carrion to prove his point.
But to poor Mrs. Brost, a
thin clothes-prop of a woman,
the trip to town was sometimes
a trial. “One of these days,”
she maintained stoutly, “that
man’s going to cause some
terrible damage.”
XJARDY sat at ease on the
** veranda when Crooked
Mick called. Some years
before there had been a bad
car-smash down the road a bit
and Bardy had bought the
wreckage for a fiver. Hacking
through the body just behind
the driver's seat he had put the
rear seat, complete with boot,
on the veranda. It made a
good, cheap, comfortable
lounge and Mrs. Bardy was
able to use the boot for storage,
mainly fowl-feed. She spoke
of it proudly as one of her
built-in cupboards.
Crooked Mick told Bardy
about the electricity-extension
and went on to say that, as the
job would need a few poles, it
might pay Bardy to see the
engineer. •
Bardy thought about this that
night. He wasn’t overfond of
work, but could never knock
back the chance of “earning an
easy quid or two.” There was
plenty of timber up in the
mountain and Mick had said
the poles required would run
into twenty or thirty pounds.
Getting the poles down to the
road was a mere bagatelle.
With his six milking-cows, the
wall-eyed steer and the old
bull, Bardy reckoned he had a
team good enough for the job.
The thing that had him
stuipped, though, was the
approach to the electrical
engineer in town; contracts
and forms gave Bardy the
jitters. He’d tried to talk Mick
into seeing the engineer for him.
But Crooked Mick had shied
off that like a fidgety colt from
a sheet of newspaper blowing
along the road.
“Strike me pink, mate; I
can’t do that. I’d be shot if
it got around that I was mixed
up in shire-contracts. This is a
thing between you and me, see ;
and don't ever forget it.”
From which Bardy gathered
that Mick would want a bit of
a rake-off from the poles. Still,
Bardy reckoned, if he got the
poles down first and then saw
the engineer everything would
be right.
morning after milking-
' time, Bardy lined the six
cows up two abreast, with the
wall-eyed steer and the bull in
the rear, got the rusty yokes
and chains on, and with the
long bullock-whip and suitable
language got the team up the
road.
Some years before, for a
reason now lost in antiquity,
Brost had gained shire
approval to erect a gate across
the road ; the gate sagged on
broken hinges and was never
closed, but lay drunkenly to
one side, pivoted on the
bottom hinge. Yet it was
closed and padlocked when
Bardy came back with his
second load of poles that after-
noon.
With the long whip gripped
in his hands, Bardy glared
belligerently at the rusty chain
(Continued on page 49)
ONE WINTER MORNING
One winter morning when the sun
was muted by the lifting mist
I saw a dew-bright magpie run
along the ground, upon the frost,
with open beak brimful of song.
I stood within the circled mist
and watched his singing bring the sun.
I saw the glistening of the frost
cadenza with his trilling run.
The mist around us rose like song.
Like song the answer of the sun
gave back the world I’d thought well lost;
the magpie thinking this well done
stopped singing. Then with head down-thrust
he nibbled dew. He raised his head.
The liquid in his beak he tossed
with such a flash of silver sun
it made me laugh, it made me thrust
my head like his. And that well done
the mist had gone. I raised my head,
and all around me moved the sun.

Is This the Solution to Sydney's Traffic Problem?
Tunnels Without Tunnelling
ANY proposal which holds out hope
of easing Sydney’s trans-Harbor
traffic-problem may be expected
to arouse the interest of the tens
of thousands of motorists who find
themselves caught-up twice a day in the
frustrating bottleneck of the Harbor
Bridge. And provided it is within the
bounds of feasibility and of economic
costs it should also interest all those
authorities whose job it is to do some-
thing about the problem.
For that reason it is rather puzzling
that Mr. Cahill last year rejected the
Carter scheme for harbor-tunnels on the
score that (I) the need was to disperse
traffic west of the Bridge rather than
east; (2) the terrain west of the Bridge
did not lend itself satisfactorily to tunnel-
ling, and (3) tunnels in other positions
suggested, although technically possible,
would not offer an effective solution to the
overall traffic problem. The remarks are
still more puzzling when it is realised
that they were made only a short time
after an official traffic-survey had shown
that more than half the Bridge traffic
originated in Mosman or further east,
and that on the City side more than a
third of it went to destinations east
or south of the city. As to reason (2), the
Carter tunnels don’t involve tunnelling!
It’s Been Done Elsewhere
THE Carter tunnel is a prefabricated
tunnel. This may sound rather like the
farmer’s dream of readymade postholes,
but there’s really no similarity. The
prefab, tunnel is a concrete tube, con-
structed in sections which are then
assembled on the bed of the harbor. And
it’s no dream ; there are something like
40 of them in use in various parts of the
world, the oldest still giving safe and
satisfactory service after 52 years. This
is the Lincoln tube which runs under the
Hudson River to link Manhattan and
New Jersey. Not only are the twin tubes
opened in 1906 still in use, but in May
last year a third tube was opened which
has the effect of doubling the traffic-
capacity of the system.
In Texas there are three tunnels of a
length comparable to those suggested for
Sydney. The Washburn tunnel under the
Houston Ship Canal at Pasadena is 3791 ft.
in length ; another under the same canal,
at Baytown, was completed in 1953, and
is 3009 ft. long. A third, of 3350 ft., takes
traffic under the Elizabeth River. The
twin-tube under Baltimore Harbor is 1.7
miles long—more than one-and-a-half
times the longest tunnel proposed by Mr.
Carter. Last September Queen Juliana
opened the Velsen tunnel which carries
four lanes of traffic, two railway-tracks,
and two footways for 2500 ft., passing
under the North Sea Canal.
The most recent example is the tunnel
under the Straits of Kyushu, the first of a
series of five designed to link-up the road-
systems of the four main islands of Japan.
“A Traffic Pipeline”
WHEN Mr. D. R. Carter, 8.E.,
A.M.I.C.E.Aust., read a paper on
his proposals to a meeting of the Institute
of Engineers in Sydney last July, it was
favorably commented on by men who
should have been competent to pass
judgment. He says his scheme may be
briefly described as a traffic-pipeline
assembled from prefabricated tubes. These
are made of Portland cement and normal
aggregates and are precast in lengths
up to 500 ft.
These sections, with the ends sealed
up, can be floated into positions previously
prepared by dredging. “The sections can
be made to span as bridges between piers
based on rock and will be retained in
place by a heavier concrete made with
magnetite ore to resist the uplifting forces
which will follow backfilling or silting-up
of the trench. An approach-ramp, partly
in opencut and partly in precast tunnel,
will lead from each shore to a tower. The
towers will contain ventilation-equipment,
air-pollution recorders, telephones and
other control- and emergency-gear.
Mr. Carter compares the construction-
method with that used for building the
Mulberry Harbors used in the Normandy
landings in World War 11, but contrasts
the difficulties which that operation
entailed —towage across the open sea
and assembly on an open roadstead in
the face of hostile fire —with the far
easier task of assembling the sections in
a sheltered harbor at sites previously
prepared and accurately surveyed.
A point emphasised by the designer is
that his tunnels are not intended to pro-
vide a main or primary crossing of the
Harbor, but to relieve congestion on the
main artery, the Bridge. Provision would
not have to be made for heavy vehicles ;
cars and light vehicles comprise the
greater part of trans-Harbor traffic.
Where to Put Them
CTTES suggested for tunnels are not
necessarily the narrowest parts of the
Harbor, but are those which it is con-
sidered would be most useful in
reducing the main stream of trans-
Harbor traffic. Thus the tunnel pro-
posed for Benelong Point goes not to
Kirribilli, where it would merely dis-
gorge its traffic into the existing rat-
race, but to Kurraba Point (distance
4000 ft.), giving access to Mosman,
Manly and Warringah by a route well
clear of the Pacific Highway procession.
A similar advantage is claimed for a
tunnel (5000 ft. long) connecting Mrs.
Macquarie’s Chair with Cremorne Point.
In favor of the Benelong tunnel it is
pointed out that access would be from
the least-congested comer of the city.
Mr. Carter recommends a close investi-
gation of this route and “almost
immediate construction.” As it would
require excavations beneath the site of
the proposed Opera House a decision
would have to be made before work on
that project began, otherwise the chance
would probably be lost for ever. The
tunnel from Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair is
suggested for later consideration, with
the proviso that the question of resump-
tions and route should be borne in mind
when granting building-permits in the
Woolloomooloo area.
A third site, but one which Mr. Carter
thinks would give far less advantage than
the others, is Walsh Bay-Blues Point. It
is the shortest of the three (1500 ft.) and
its traffic would have to be routed west
of the Pacific Highway until after the
Mosman-Manly-Warringah traffic had
been shed.
One-way Traffic /
AT every site selected it is suggested
that at least two tunnels should be
built, each carrying two lanes of traffic
in one direction only. This one-way
plan makes for greater safety and avoids
the problem of blinding headlights. The
provision of an extra tunnel or tunnels
at the same site to cope with peak-hour
traffic would, of course, be much less
costly than the original tunnel.
A novel feature of Mr. Carter’s design
is the provision made for nursing the
motorists’ eyes through the transition
from daylight to the artificial light of the
tunnel —a cause of discomfort and even
of accidents in other parts of the world.
He suggests that the opencut approaches
should be covered with lattice of evenly-
decreasing openness so that the intensity
of daylight is progressively reduced as the
tunnel-entrance is approached, enabling
the eyes to make a natural adjustment.
Lighting in the tunnels will be entirely
indirect, to avoid glare Toll-collection
hold-up will be minimised by an
ingenious method of staggered toll-gates.
In favoring prefabricated tunnels rather
than another bridge or bridges, Mr.
Carter points out the vast difference in
cost. He claims that a new Harbor
Bridge would cost about £45 million, plus
the cost of resumptions. He estimates
that the Benelong tunnel could be con-
structed for £l2 million, with only a
negligible sum for resumptions.
As to finance, it is proposed that the
tunnels could be built by private enter-
prise on a franchise-basis with the right
to charge a toll for a fixed number of
years, after which they would revert to
public ownership. This suggestion is not
likely to appeal to the Cahill Govern-
ment, but as Opposition-leader Morton
has recently been advocating something
similar for the Eastern Suburbs Railway
it might be worth his party’s while to get
some of its engineers and economists to
make a thorough examination of the
Carter scheme.


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
V.R.C.
Melbourne racing goes next
Saturday to Flemington, where
the V.R.C. will stage the first
day of its traditional autumn
carnival. ■ During the four days
—March 1,5, 8 and 10 —the
club will distribute at least
£53,500 in stake-money and
trophies ; more if divisions are
necessary. The first day of the
meeting will be honored by the
presence of the Queen Mother.
The V.R.C. has altered the
usual pattern of the carnival
to make next Saturday’s pro-
gramme as attractive a day’s
racing as one could wish for.
No other race throughout the
carnival will create as much
interest as the Queen Eliza-
beth Stakes. This 13-furlongs
w.f.a. event offers no less than
£lO,OOO stake-money, plus a
trophy valued at £l5O. The
field will be worthy of the
prize—Tulloch, Prince Darius
and Sailor’s Guide, Australia’s
three best horses, are entered.
The Queen Mother will present
the trophy to the winning
owner.
Flemington selections:
Queen Elizabeth Stakes:
Prince Darius, 1 ; Sailor’s
Guide, 2 ; Tulloch, 3.
Sires’ Produce Stakes: Mist-
ing, 1 ; Nilento, 2; Master
Rane, 3.
Newmarket Handicap :
Aboukir, 1 ; Endius, 2 ; Copper
Year, 3.
Glamis Steeplechase: Pedro’s
Pride, 1 ; Co-Star, 2; Noble
Law, 3.
The Queen Elizabeth Stakes
will settle the racing question
of the moment: Can Tulloch
recapture his wonderful form
of the spring? When Tulloch
went for his summer spell, a
sequence of nine wins behind
him, it looked as if the rich
w.f.a. events of the autumn
were his for the taking. His
form, and, more important, his
appearance when he raced in
the St. George Stakes at Caul-
field, discount his chances of
winning next Saturday’s race.
One thing is certain: He will
start at more lucrative odds
than we thought to see quoted
against him this autumn.
• • • •
In the Sires Produce Stakes
the Queen Mother will see the
pick of Australia’s two-year-
olds. The race, rated a classic
event, is over seven furlongs
and carries £4OOO stake-money.
Colts carry 8.10, fillies 8.7.
Last year Tulloch won and
completed a hat-trick for
Sydney-trained horses —before
him, Knave and Starover had
been successful. Prior to
Knave’s win, however, Vic-
torian horses had won the race
13 times running. The race is
one of the oldest in the Aus-
tralian calendar, dating to
1862.
The V.R.C. is putting on a
special race the Glamis-
Steeplechase—in honor of the
Queen Mother. At this time
of the year most of our best
cross-country horses would still
be spelling, under normal con-
ditions, but trainers of jumpers
have advanced preparation in
the hope of winning the trophy
that goes with this race. The
field will be up to Grand
National standard. It is good
to know that Pedro’s Pride, the
best jumping mare ever to
race in this country, will be
fit to run. So, too, will Noble
Law, brought back from retire-
ment in the hope that he can
win this race.
In such a well-balanced pro-
gramme the Newmarket, tradi-
tionally the most important
sprint event of Victorian racing,
is almost overshadowed. The
Newmarket dates to 1874. The
record-book shows that most
of our famous sprinters have
won the race: horses like
Heroic, Gothic, Aurie’s Star,
Ajax, All Veil, Bernborough
and Royal Gem. Aspen
(1880-81) and Gothic (1927-28)
are the only two horses to
have won the Newmarket
twice. Last year King’s Fair
set a race-record when he won
in 1.10. Greenline’s 10.2 in
1930 is the weight-carrying
record for the race.
Much of the credit for
Zariba’s win in last Saturday’s
Futurity Stakes goes to former
Westralian jockey Frank Treen.
At the turn into the straight
Zariba was second-last. Unper-
turbed, Treen kept to the rails,
passed horse after horse until
his run was blocked a furlong
out, then pulled his mount one
horse wide, sooled it through
a narrow opening, and raced it
home a comfortable winner.
Zariba deserved to win a good
race. He has run well several
times since coming from New
Zealand, without quite living
up to the reputation he
established in the Dominion.
Melbourne businessman Neil
Fetch paid a high price for the
five-year-old son of Pheroz-
shah. That is his policy as an
owner. He prefers to pay well
for a proved horse rather than
risk buying a yearling. Since
be took to racing as a hobby
he has spent some £20,000 on
bloodstock, and even so is
probably ahead of the game.
Timor won last year’s Epsom
for him, and he has done well
with his two-year-old buy,
Astounding.
• • • •
Following his effortless win
in last Saturday’s Merson
Cooper Stakes, the grey colt
Misting stands out as the best
two-year-old racing in Aus-
tralia. On a track deadened by
days of soaking rain, Misting
cantered over the six furlongs
of the race in 1.12 7/10. At
ievel weights, he was opposed
by Master Rane, who had run
up a sequence of six straight
wins, and the Sydney gelding,
Man of Iron, who had won his
previous three races. And in
such good company Misting
was never off the bit to win
by two-and-a-half lengths. This
success following his win over
Dubbo in the Lightning Stakes
suggests that Misting will have
no trouble to win next Satur-
day’s Sires Produce Stakes at
Flemington. It is unlikely that
Sydney will see Misting this
autumn. The colt was not
entered for the A.J.C. Sires
Produce Stakes or the Golden
Slipper Stakes.
Droll Prince, whose blood
lines were set out here a few
weeks back, has come good
with a vengeance. Prior to this
year, the four-year-old son of
Comic Court had been a most
disappointing horse, but he has
uow won three times from four
starts over a period of six
weeks. As usual, he raced near
the lead in the nine-furlongs St.
Clair Handicap at Caulfield,
and in the run home shook off
all opposition to win well. He
is engaged in the Australian
Cup and the Sydney Cup. He
has been weighted at 8.4 at
Flemington, 8.8 at Randwick.
He has a first-class chance in
both races.
• • • •
Victorian three - year - olds
were no match for the Sydney
youngsters last spring, and the
funning of the 10-furlongs
Stanley Plate at Caulfield last
Saturday suggests that the
position will be no different
during the autumn racing. Cer-
tainly the winner, Wool Man,
put up a good staying perform-
ance to come from eighth into
the straight to win narrowly,
but the field was not strong,
and one could not see any of
the runners offering serious
opposition to the Sydney colts
in the St. Leger. The win was
Wool Man’s first since he won
the Debutant Stakes in
October, 1956. The horse
broke down following that win,
and it has taken trainer Phil
Burke a long time to get him
sound again. Ron Hutchinson
rode Wool Man —his first
success since his heavy fall at
Caulfield last November. Later

in the day he made it a double
yvhen he won on My Hour.
Although unplaced in the
Stanley Plate won by Wool
Man, last year’s Oaks winner,
Amarco, rattled home in
fourth place. She is sure to win
a race shortly. She can stay like
a bailiff, and a race like the
mile-and-a-half River Handicap
at Flemington next Saturday
would suit her admirably.
One of the best Newmarkef
trials seen at Flemington was
My Hour’s success in the six-
furlongs Hawksburn Handicap.
The Adelaide horse’s form has
been very good during this
visit to Melbourne. He was
just touched-off by Golden
Doubles in the William Reid
Stakes at Moonee Valley, and
had none of the luck of the
race in the Oakleigh Plate.
Disappointment of the Hawks-
burn field was New Spec, who
was sent out a hot favorite
following his good second in
the Oakleigh Plate. He may
have had enough racing for
the present.
• • • •
My Hour is weighted at 8.6
in the Newmarket, but can be
penalised up to 101 b. for Satur-
day’s success. The extent of
the penalty will be a guide to
his chance in the rich sprint.
• • • •
Success of Victorian-bred
two-year-olds during the spring
and autumn suggests that the
dominance of N. S. Wales and
New Zealand horses may have
run its cycle. Certainly, keen
interest will be taken in the
Victorian yearling-sales to be
conducted over the next week.
Friday next, February 28, the
Australian Bloodstock Agency
will offer 128 yearlings. Mist-
ing’s great form ensures keen
bidding for the grey filly and
chestnut colt by his sire,
Meadow Mist, to be offered at
this sale. The filly is out of
Morongo (by Helios, imp.) and
is a half-sister to Beau Ottoman.
The colt is out of Busybody
(by Talking). Busybody was
more than useful, winning
amongst other races the
y.A.T.C. Christmas Handicap.
• • • •
Wright, Stephenson and Co.
will offer 335 yearlings at their
sales on March 3 and 6.
Possibly no youngsters at these
sales will attract greater interest
than the progeny of Landau,
the sire imported by V.R.C.
committeeman E. A. Under-
wood for £26,250 a record
price for a sire imported to
Australia. Landau is by Eng-
lish Derby winner Dante, a son
of the unbeaten Nearco. He
was raced by her Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth, for whom he
won six races. He will be
represented by eight yearlings.
His colt from La Patrice (dam
of Matrice) may top the sale.
Keen interest will be taken,
at both the Australian Blood-
stock Agency’s and Wright,
Stephenson’s sales, in the first
get of Hydrogen. This winner
of £59,429 in stake-money has
in his first season at the stud
sired 18 colts from 19 mares.
* * *
—and Sydney
In winning the Welter
Handicap at Rosehill on Caesar,
G. Moore gave one of the
most polished exhibitions of
riding seen on a suburban
track for many months. Caesar
didn’t seem to be in the race
until he got a clear run in the
final half-furlong, getting up
in the last stride to snatch
victory. My Hali seemed a
certain winner entering the
final furlong, but the 9.11 on
a holding track caused him to
tire quickly, and Huntly
narrowly cut him out of
second money. Caesar was one
of the tail-enders at the half-
mile. Moore was given a big
hand for his fine win, and was
also cheered for his win on
another favorite, Waterford, in
the Rosehill Handicap. He
retained his recently adopted
poker-face.
• • • •
At his three starts prior to
winning Rosehill’s Second
Parramatta Stakes at 10 to 1,
Pinchgut had started at much
shorter prices. In fact, he was
favorite in two of them. The
gelding won at Randwick on
January 18, was second at
Rosehill on February 2 and
ninth at Canterbury on
February 8. His moderate
showing in the last-named
Graduation Stakes caused him
to ease in betting at Rosehill,
but his excellent racing condi-
tion brought him many backers
at 10 to 1. Pinchgut was first
away from the barrier and
wasn’t again troubled. He now
goes into open company, but
he’s a sprinter of much promise
and could quickly score in
Welter company up to seven
furlongs.
• • • •
Achnacary, backed to odds-
on, missed a place in Rosehill’s
First Parramatta Stakes. His
unfancied stablemate, Ermis,
also finished fourth in the final
event, the Welter, and on his
performance it will surprise
Sydney racegoers if he doesn’t
quickly win a race. Ermis, a
six-year- old gelding by Hang-
over, hadn’t raced for more
than four months, but
apparently had been galloping
fairly well. He has raced over
longer distances than 1\
furlongs in Brisbane, and will
be suited to 11 furlongs in
Sydney.

Rosehill trainer Jack Daniels
added another to his winning
list when Leebana, trained on
the course, won the Two-year-
old Graduation Stakes at Rose-
hill in brilliant style. The
Newtown Wonder colt, who
had finished second at three
prior starts, had no trouble beat-
ing the short-priced favorite,
Skyline. Leebana cost 1800gns.
as a yearling ; first money was
£749. He is from the Melfort
(imp.) mare Melcovent, whose
dam, Covenant, was a daughter
of Law Maker (imp.) and
Stephanite (imp.). The colt's
half-brothers P e r m e 1 and
Persian Lad have won several
races, but Melcovent didn't
sport silk. Leebana is raced by
the trainer’s wife in partnership
with Mrs. E. B. Walker.
It didn’t say'much for the
younger horses when seven-
year-old Brentford beat them
with something in hand in the
Rosehill First Parramatta
Stakes. The Bradford gelding
is owned and trained by E. F.
Smith, of Newcastle. He bred
Bradford, sire of Brentford, and
also the latter gelding, who won
a Newcastle Novice Six on
January 1 and finished third at
Canterbury Park on February
12. Smith has made frequent
visits to Sydney and he
generally manages to figure in
the prizemoney. Years ago he
raced a successful stayer,
Donald, who won races in the
best company at Randwick.

Basandi, narrow winner of
Doomben (Brisbane) First Two-
year-old Handicap, was sold
at the Sydney yearling-sales last
autumn for a modest 210gns.
A first foal, the bay filly is by
Jambo (imp.) from Tutu by
Genetout (Fr.), and is related to
Roxford, a Randwick winner.
Basandi’s dam goes back to
Trenton, a top stayer of earlier
years. Family lines included
Sweet Nell (Caulfield Cup and
V.R.C. Oaks) and Gasbag
(N.Z. Canterbury Cup). The
filly is raced by Mrs. J.
Portley and B. Nolan, and is
trained by E. Tanwan. At the
same meeting Rim Huff, who
was unplaced in Shahwan’s
Rosehill Welter the previous
Saturday, won the Flying
Handicap. This gelding had
also failed in other Sydney
races. Rim Huff beat Fire Dust,
who was trained at Rosebery
at one time by Gordon Brown.
Brown won the 1955 A.J.C.
Doncaster Handicap with the
gelding.
Two of the runners in the
Rosehilf Handicap, Waterford
(winner), and Coal, were on
trial as middle-distance pro-
positions. Waterford came
through his test with flying
colors, but Coal finished in the
middle of the field. At best
she’s moderate, but Waterford
has always given promise of
developing into a top per-
former, and he should repeat
his latest success in better com-
pany. Maybe he will be set
for the A.J.C. Doncaster Handi-
cap, for which he is weighted
at Bst. Waterford, well ridden
by G. Moore, got up in the
final few strides to beat the
consistent Lindbergh and the
pacemaker, Sundisc.
There must be many moder-
ate gallopers in training on
Sydney tracks, as the A.J.C.
received 320 nominations for
next Saturday’s Warwick Farm
fixture. The A.J.C. is catering
for the non-winners and horses
eligible for restricted company
at the Warwick Farm fixture,
and, at time of writing, before
acceptances, it looked like
being a day of mostly big
fields. In four races upwards
of 50 horses were entered.
Some of these unproved
gallopers cannot win a track-
gallqp, far less a race. On the
same programme the A.J.C.
has the usual main double, and
several top performers have
been entered for these races.

Turkestan showed such excel-
lent form in the spring that he

was only temporary, as he was
quickly deposed by Squander
Lad, who won at Rosehill last
Saturday week. Turkestan
made his first appearance since
the spring when he competed
in the Rosehill Flying Handi-
cap last Saturday. Trainer G.
Brown didn’t give the three-
year-old more than an outside
chance, at best an each - way
prospect, and though he was
satisfied with the colt’s perform-
ance, not many who had
fancied him earlier for the Don-
caster now give him more than
a rough show in the mile.
Turkestan jumped out smartly
and many were surprised to
see him running a close fifth at
the home turn. However, after
that Turkestan quickly dropped
back, and beat a few home.
The race should sharpen him
up, but he has had a fair bit
of fast galloping since resum-
ing after a spell, and isn’t as
robust as might be expected.

Surprise withdrawal of
champion filly Best Ever caused
many changes in betting on the
final of the £IOOO. Youthful
Stakes at Harold Park on
Friday. Driver Caffyn had two
other horses in the final, Robert
Lawn and Eden Monaro —he
elected to drive Robert Lawn,
who had been beaten into
second place in his heat on the
previous Friday, after several
checks. This time Caffyn kept
Robert Lawn out wide for most
of the journey, about three
horses back. Big Time (who
had beaten Robert Lawn in the
first heat) took the lead at the
bell, but two furlongs from
home the Lawn Rock colt
started to bridge the gap, and
beat Big Time by a neck.
Favorite Determined Boy
(5/4) easily won the Harold
Park Handicap by 1| lengths
from Defiance (10/1) and
Malniri (7/2). After being
ninth early, Determined Boy
went very fast to be third at the
bell. Percy Hall kept him going
and he finished an easy winner.

The Australian Rugby Union
Wallabies lost their last two
games in Britain, to make their
British record 14 wins, three
draws and 13 losses. Not a
particularly imposing record ;
still, they were afflicted by
injury, and, anyway, most of
their defeats were by very
narrow margins. Their main
weakness lay in insufficiently
penetrative backs. At Coventry,
on a heavy ground, Midlands
won 8-3, the only try of the
game being scored by Mid-
lands fullback Allison. At
Cardiff on Saturday, in a fairly
open game in the mud, an

tralia’s great forward Nick

Swimming world-beaters:
Seventeen world-records and
innumerable Australian and
Victorian records were shattered in
some brilliant swimming at the 1958
Australian championships just con-
cluded at Melbourne Olympic
Pool.
On Tuesday night (18/2/’SB) six
world-records were broken. First
world-record shatterer was N.S.W.
backstroker John Monckton, who,
with David Theile not competing, is
having all his own way ini the back-
strokes. After setting world-records
for the 110yds. and 100-metres on
the Saturday (mentioned here last
week), he recorded 2min. 18.4 sec.
in the 220yds., which broke his own
world-record of 2.18.8, set in Sydney
on Jan. 15 this year. (His swim
also meant a new record for the 200-
metres.)
Then came Dawn Fraser’s rather
effortless breaking of her own world-
record for 110yds. and 100-metres
freestyle (62.45ec. for 110yds..set in
Adelaide on Jan. 31 this year). Her
new time for the 110yds. was
61.5 sec. Lorraine Crapp finished
second to her —swimming enthusiasts
were really pleased that she thus
qualified for Cardiff. It could be
that Lorraine Crapp is no longer the
world’s premiere freestyler (though
she had been sick, and was not at
her top), but she’s still a mighty good
swimmer—and a fine and gracious
sportswoman. Dawn Fraser has
usually been looked on as ranking
second to Lorraine; but, particularly
in the sprints, she has had the
better record. She won the 100-
metres freestyle at the Melbourne
Olympics, with Lorraine, then right
at her top, second.
Finally, on that Tuesday night-r-
-that is, as far as world-records go—
was John Konrads’s winning of the
440yds. in 4min. 21.85ec., breaking
his own world-records for the
440yds. and 400-metres set at this
year’s N.S.W. championships.
On the Thursday night, apart from
the diving events, the two 880yds.
freestyle were swum. Sydney girl
lisa Konrads, in winning the title
ir. lOmin. 16.25ec., broke her own
world-records for the 880yds. and
800-metres set in Sydney on Jan. 9
this year. The 880yds. men’s free-
style (with John Konrads not
competing) was won by N.S.W.
surfer-swimmer Gary Winram in the
comparatively slow time of 9min.
46sec. For comparison Konrads’s
then world-record time, which he
broke on the Saturday, was 9.17.7.
John Konrads was the particular
star of the final night, last Saturday.
In winning the 1650yds. freestyle in
17min. 28.75ec., he set four new
world-records, for the 880yds., 800-
metres, 1650yds. and 1500-metres.
D.S. swimmer George Breen had
held the 1500-metres record; the
1650yds. time broke the standard-
time as promulgated by the F.I.N.A.
last year, and was not held by any
swimmer. Konrads now holds all
freestyle world-records from 200-
metres to 1650yd5., and has wiped
out from the world list the name of
Australia’s “wonder” swimmer of
those distances in 1956-57, Murray
Rose.
Two other world-records were set
on Saturday night. Dawn Fraser
set new time for the 220yds. and
200-metres in winning the 220yds.
in 2min. 14.7 sec. Lorraine Crapp
came second. Dawn Fraser had set
the previous times for the distances
(2.17.7 for 220yds.) at Adelaide on
Feb. 10 this year.
John Devitt, world-record holder
for the distance, won the 110yds.
freestyle for the second successive
year. Two other world-record
holders, Terry Gathercole (220yds.
breaststroke) and Brian Wilkinson
(110yds. butterfly), also repeated
their 1957 wins.

With the Queen Mother
gracefully attending, the Royal
Surf Carnival at North Steyne
(Sydney) on Saturday was held
in truly regal sunshine, and
provided a fit and proper
spectacle. N.S.W. champion
Brian Hutchings won the open
surf-race with 46-year-old
former Olympian swimmer
Noel Ryan coming third;
Merewether (Newcastle) won
the march-past. On Saturday,
February 6, 1954, on their visit,
the Queen and Prince Philip
attended a Royal Surf Carnival
at Bondi, also held in glorious
weather, and were so fascinated
they outstayed their scheduled
departure; as did the Queen
Mother on Saturday.

“Observer”: A “crisp and
descriptive name for Australian
football equivalent to Rugby
and Soccer” (B. 18/12/’57)?
What about Aussieball? The
name is concise and topical,
though it might lack wortd-
wide appeal. Better still, then,
is Superball, which would
have an international flavor
about it. A world-wide game
with a similar sort of name is
basketball.
“Retired S.-S. Teacher”:
What about Auskik for a
suitable name for Australian
football? By whatever name
it may become known, I wish
the good old game every
success.
“P.0.M.C.”: Popular name’
for Australian Rules? Why not
simply call it “footbrawl”?
After all, ’Rules players and
fans have always threatened the
hides of their opponents (and
umpires) with more malicious
aforethought than have their
Rugby opposites. Actually,
though, popular or descriptive
names for anything aren’t
usually designed they’re
generally coined by common
consent.

What is a fugue ?
Fugue (from Lat. fugare, to put to
flight) is a musical composition in
which given subjects are developed
through imitation, canon and
counterpoint, according to a fixed
plan. A rudimentary idea of a
fugue is the old French canon
“Frere Jacques”; a voice enters, and
at the end of the first line the
second voice comes in, followed by
a third voice, and so on. But this
example can merely give a rough
outline; it has none of the many
parts common to the master fugues.
Some of these parts are: subject
(principal voice); answer; counter-
subject ; stretto; codetta; episode;
pedal and coda. When the subject
is stated, the answer appears, either
a fifth higher or a fourth lower,
thus effecting a modulation to the
dominant key. If a fugue’s answer
is an exact transposition of the
subject it is known as a “real
iugue”; if, however, the answer is
modified (say, an interval lessened
or one or two notes changed) it is
called a “tonal fugue.” Fugue is
probably the most scientific branch
of musical composition, reaching its
perfected form at the hands of J. S.
Bach. Although the fugue was an
instrumental development, its chief
forebears were the vocal motet and
madrigal.

Information on Wolfe, the
American author who wrote “Wind
and River” and other classics ?
This is Thomas Clayton Wolfe
(1900-38); the correct title of the
novel mentioned should be Of Time
and the River. Born at Asheville,
North Carolina (the Altamont, Old
Catawba, of his fiction), he gradu-
ated from the University of North
Carolina in 1920, studied play-
writing at Harvard, where he took
M.A. (1922), and taught English
at New York University (1924-30).
After publication of his strongly
autobiographical Look Homeward,
Angel (1929) he devoted his full
time to writing. His main works,
in addition to Look Homeward,
Angel, are: Of Time and the
River (1935), The Web and the
Rock (1939), You Can’t Go Home
Again (1940) and The Hills Beyond
(1941). “Poetical passages” from
his novels were collected in The
Face of a Nation (1939) and A
Stone, a Leaf, a Door (1945). The
Hills Beyond consists of an
unfinished novel and some shorter
pieces. In Look Hompward, Angel
and other novels his main character
is Eugene Gant, whose drab life
and eventual escape parallel the
author’s own youth. In later novels
his main character is George
Webber, a projection of Eugene
Gant. In The Oxford Companion to
American Literature (1953), James
D Hart says of Wolfe’s writing,
“Throughout his fiction there is a
self-fascination and self-torment that
endow his writing now with a lofty
romantic quality, now with the
prosaic quality of literal reporting of
the hero’s life. His books cling
always to the story of his life
His prose is sometimes highly
lyrical, but there are many passages
characterised by swollen, frenzied
rhetoric.”

Any details about artist Eric
JoHiffe ?
Eric Jolliffe was born at Ports-
mouth (Eng.) in 1907, his family
emigrating to Sydney when he was
four years old. After leaving school
he worked in a variety of country
and city jobs before settling down
;ri Sydney, where for several years
he worked as a window-cleaner in
the day, taking art-lessons at night.
He sold his first drawing to The
Bulletin, and became a regular con-
tributor when he “inherited” from
Arthur Horner the character of
Andy. He was for a time a staff-
artist on the “A.B.C. Weekly,” and
m recent years has contributed
prolifically to “Pix.” In War II
he was a camouflage-officer with the
R.A.A.F., serving in the N.T., and
since the war has done several
artistic “walkabouts” in Arnhem
Land, New Guinea, and the Tro-
briands. His books of cartoons
include the “Andy” series, “Salt-
bush Bill,” “Corroboree,”
“Witchettv’s Tribe ” etc
witcnetty s tribe, etc.

Some information on the aneroid
barometer ?
. ,
The aneroid (fluidless) barometer
consists of a hollow metal box
from which the air has been
exhausted. On top of the box is a
steel spring capable of moving with
the top of the chamber and
attached to a lever that operates a
spindle and pointer. Varying atmos-
pheric pressuies cause the top of
the chamber to rise or fall since,
as it encloses a vacuum, there is
no pressure ins.de to support it and
it must therefore respond to outside
-pressure. Thus the pointer indicates
the varying atmospheric pressure.
ihe indicator-scale is graduated to
correspond with the standard
mercury-barometer.

poe r t ie Hemv S Con!tabh ° f
poet Henry Constable?
Born in England in 1562, he
graduated from Cambridge in 1580
and travelled to Paris, spending
much of his time there. In 1598
he tried to form a new English
Catholic college in Paris; five years
later, returning to London, he was
confined to the Tower for about a
year for alleged anti-British activities
in France.
Constable was a friend of Sidney,
Harington and Bolton. His Diana:
the Praises of his Mistrpss in
certaine sweete sonnets by H.C., a
series of 23 sonnets, was published
ir> 1592, and was praised by Jonson.
Among his other notable works are
Spirit nail Sonnettps to the Honor
of God and hys Sayntes, by H.C.,
first printed by T. Park from MS.
in 1815, and The Shepheard’s Song
of Venus and Adonis (1600). For

From “C.H.R.”: Reference is
made in B. 12/2/’5B to Dick and
Jim Marston in Robbery Under
Arms. When living in Sydney in
1910 I remember “Rolf Boldre-
wood” (T. A. Browne) saying he
drew these characters around two
rather wild young men who later
steadied down, going to South
Africa, where they did well on the
land. But he could easily have
included incidents from the two lives
mentioned (Frank Gardiner, Fred
Ward). Anyhow, Robbery Under

EXPLORER
PRESS - COMMENT from
New York, London and
elsewhere on Uncle Sam s
successful launching of the
satellite Explorer.
New York “Herald Tribune”:
“At precisely 10.55 p.m. (EST)
on January 31, 1958, the United
States of America regained its
national pride.
“At that moment, at that
date, it sent its own earth-
satellite successfully into orbit.
“Now three moons hurtle
through the heavens —the old
one, the American one, and
the Russian. The American
moon hurtles at an average
height of 700 miles or 200 miles
higher than Sputnik 11.
“It is ironical, but true, that
what the Army’s Redstone
Arsenal boys did they could
have done all of two years ago.
Their chief, Wernher von
Braun, was ready then to put
up such a satellite. He was
prevented from doing so only
by service rivalries and the
incredible unimaginativeness of
then defence - boss Charles
Wilson, who actually issued
orders forbidding him to let
Jupiter orbit.
“Partly because of Wilson’s
blindness to the psychological
importance of a satellite, and
partly because of Air Force
fears of Army predominance in
missiles, the moon project was
fobbed-off on an inferior Navy
missile, the Viking (later Van-
guard) which many think never
had sufficient power for orbit-
ing, and whose disasters resulted
from hasty attempts to soup it
up beyond its proper strength.
“The Soviets may now claim,
and doubtless will, that a 301 b.
satellite is a far cry from their
half-ton one. But the important
thing is that the American
launching ability is now proved.
As for heavier satellites, the Air
Force’s Thor missile, which is
much more powerful than
Jupiter, can doubtless launch
them, if adapted to the task.”
* * *
Walter Lippmann in N.Y .
“Herald Tribune” : “Explorer is
a good popular antidote to the
panicky view that we [the U.S.]
are in mortal danger. But it
does not wash out the main
portent of sputnik—which is
not that the Russians launched
a satellite first and that their
satellite is very much bigger
and heavier than Explorer. The
main portent is that, starting at
the end of World War II with
their country devastated, their
technology far more primitive
than our own, the Russians
have achieved a rate of scientific
and technological development
which, is faster than our own.
What they did with the sputnik
shows not merely that they have
mastered a particular specialty
but that they have generated
a tremendous momentum in the
physical sciences and their
application.
“Though Explorer is in the
sky, there is no reason to think
that the comparative rate of

LAUNCHED ONE EITHER’ DON’T HELP ANY.”
development is now back in
balance, much less that it is
in our favor. We are still the
bigger and the stronger. But
they are still moving forward
the faster.”
* * *
“New York Times” : “This is
a good time for all of us to
remember that neither Russians
nor Americans can claim any
kind of exclusive credit for the
progress made to date toward
man’s conquest of space. Like
all man’s greatest scientific
adventures, the march of
humanity toward the cosmos is
the product of the work of
many men of many nations
over many centuries. When the
history of space-travel comes
to be written in the future its
pages will hold honored places
for such figures of the far past
as Copernicus, Kepler and
Newton. Albert Einstein’s
name will be prominent in these
annals, as will the German,
Hermann Oberth; the
American, Robert Goddard,
and the Russian, Konstantin
Tsiolkovsky. To all these and
to a host of lesser figures all
humanity is indebted for the
possibility of breaking the
chains of gravity which still
bind us to this small planet.”

Madrid “Ya” : “It is to be
supposed that America will
now embark upon a series of
spectacular interplanetary
adventures.
“Have the Americans reached
this point?
“We know only that the
Explorer is smaller than the
Russian sputniks but much
faster, and, at twice their alti-
tude, is now circling the world.
“The impressionable
American people have reacted
with happy shouts. All the
country is as off to the fair.
This will serve as a moral tonic
to rebuild the injuries suffered
in the last few months.”

London “Daily Telegraph” :
“The scientific race is now on.
Alpha, 1958, may well be
followed by Beta, and even
Gamma. Sputnik 111 will
probably be taking its place in
the galaxy of satellites before
long. Of course these devices
have their military implications.
The two giants are not just play-
ing with fireworks. But, for
better or worse, the age of
space-exploration is with us,
and we must learn to adjust our
lives to it. In time, the launching
of an untenanted satellite will
have become so commonplace
that people will marvel that it
should once have been the
signal for a nation first to lose
confidence and then to regain
it. We in this country seem to
have been very wise to be con-
tent with Zeta, on the ground.”
* * *
London “Daily Express':
“Now what about one for
Britain?
“Lord Hailsham says we
could only have built it at the
cost of ‘much human misery.’
Yet all that is needed is a
rocket like Jupiter, which
launched Explorer, And soon
just such rockets will be sent
to bases in Britain.
“A pity the [U.K.] Govern-
ment is taking no interest in
earth-satellites. Zeta has shown
what marvels Britain’s scientists
can achieve, given half a
chance. They should not be
left earthbound in the challenge
of outer space.”
* * *
London “Daily Mail”: “Their
[America’s] programme was
begun in 1948 by James
Forrestal, who died trying to
get inter-service co-operation.
“As the years passed each
service produced its own pro-
ject—the Army the Jupiter, the
Navy the Vanguard, the Air
Force the Atlas. By 1954,
Army and Navy were working
together on Jupiter.
“But in 1955 they fell apart.
The Navy’s Vanguard was
chosen by a Government panel
and Jupiter was side-tracked.
Vanguard failed, and now a
revived Jupiter has triumphed.
“There is a lesson in this
melancholy story —and in the
witty comment of a French
newspaper that the American
and Russian satellites met in
space and spoke to each other
—in German.
“The lesson is that all nations
should be working together.
The Germans, as we British
know only too well, were ahead
of all others in missiles 15 years
ago.

(NOT BEING BRITISH SUBJECTS)
who attained the age of 18 years between Ist January, 1957,
and 30th June, 1957 (inclusive), who were in Australia on

Registration forms may be obtained from Post Offices and District Employment
Offices of the Department of Labour and National Service. Detailed instructions
are given in these forms.
WHEN TO REGISTER:
Registration forms must be completed and forwarded to the Registrar for
National Service by 10th March, 1958, even though the person required to
register may not actually turn 18 until after that date.
BALLOT:
A Ballot will be held in April to select those registrants who are to bo

“If these experts are not to
be allowed to work with all
countries for the good of man-
kind, then we of the West
should at least have co-opera-
tion among ourselves.
“Yet one newspaper says it
is ‘utterly shameful’ that Britain
is not in the race. Anyone
would think the nation which
evolved Zeta (much more use-
ful than sputniks) lacked
science, resource, and enter-
prise.
“We have them all. But we
need money. The two sputniks,
it is estimated, cost the
Russians £lOOO million. How
could we possibly afford any-
thing like that?
“Let us try not to be starry-
eyed or moonstruck in this
matter. The sense of it is that
if the nations pool their brains
earthmen will get to the stars
faster. Is that not the lesson
of the American services?”

“Manchester Guardian”:
“Two postscripts must be
added. First, let us not forget
too soon the lesson of the last
few months —that the Russians,
with their educational system
and their resources, can now
draw level in any field of tech-
nology on which they choose
to concentrate (even if there are
mud huts in Outer Mongolia).
Secondly, anyone in Britain
who says that for prestige this
country must be the next to
a satellite ought to have
his head examined. We are not
in the race to produce fantastic-
ally expensive long- range
rockets. Zeta is far better
value.”

London “Sunday Times":
“The redressment both of the
military and of the psycho-
logical balance [between the
U.S.A. and the Soviet] is a
good omen for the high-level
talks which public opinion
insists should take place soon,
in an effort to stop the vortex
of competitive armament and
world-wide cold-warfare ; [the
launching of Explorer]
should rid the United States of
the smarting sense of being
drawn into negotiating from a
position of inferiority. And the
simultaneous orbiting of
Russian and American satellites
picks out in heavy type the first
item of Mr. Eisenhower’s
agenda for the summit talks —•
the repudiation of the use of
outer space for military pur-
poses. Disarmament must start
somewhere: why not here?”

Paris “Le Monde ” : “It seems
today that after so many set-
backs, of which the most
pitiable was that of the unfor-

continues to exist, but it will
not necessarily last for ever.
“One can congratulate one-
self all the more since the
knowledge of their superiority
has not incited the leaders of
the Kremlin these days to take
a particularly flexible attitude
in their discussions with the
West.”

Moscow “Pravda”: “The
launching of the Soviet
artificial satellites and the first

basis for scientific international

it is better to build ships for
interplanetary communications

ments race.”

Edinburgh “Scotsman” :
“The Russian reaction to the
news has been tactful. There
was some reason to suppose
that Mr. Dulles’s patent unwill-
ingness to embark on new
negotiations about outstanding
problems was based on the con-
viction that America must wait
until she had regained a clear
lead in the arms-race. This
was in accordance with his
earlier principle of negotiation
from positions of strength. But
commanding strategic
superiority is out of the ques-
fon for either side. The stark
fact is the power of each side
to destroy the other. Nothing
is to be gained in that respect
by waiting. Every effort should
be devoted to framing pro-
posals on which negotiation is
feasible.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post”: “It is
significant, and admirable, that
the first reaction of an
American Government spokes-
man to the cheering news
should be an invitation to the
Soviet Union and other nations
to join the United States in
discussing the international
control of these regions beyond
earth’s orbit which might so
soon become a new sphere of
dangerous rivalry among the
Great Powers.
“Mr. Richard Nixon, the
United States Vice-President,
stressed that the Russian and
American people would accom-
plish far more for themselves
and the world by working
together for peace than they
would by a contest for military
supremacy in outer space.
“This new American achieve-
ment is well calculated to per-
suade the Soviet leaders to
think twice about Mr. Nixon’s
appeal. It should also do much
to strengthen the chances of
high-level talks, since it will
make the American Govern-
ment able to make a generous
gesture without fearing that it
will be interpreted as a craven
resort to appeasement.”

Lisbon “Diario Popular”:
“The fact that the United
States has at last put up a
satellite will have important
psychological results and in
general will benefit the Western
cause. The proof now given
that America has the necessary
technical know-how to put an
artificial satellite into its orbit
goes a long way toward restor-
ing the balance. Above all, it
will enable the Government of
the United States to enter
negotiations in a very different
spirit. There is no doubt that
American technical men
achieved a triumph which puts
an end to a passing Western
crisis and demonstrates once
more the immense capabilities
of the free world.”

London “Economist” : “An
American satellite has at last
penetrated the gremlin barrier
into realms where hitherto only
Soviet moons have swum.
Explorer partly restores the
international balance of self-
esteem ; but it does not affect
the balance of military power.
The rocket that pushed it into
space was a research rocket for
the intermediate-range Jupiter,
whereas the much larger
New York “Herald Tribune "
LATIN AMERICAN LESSON
Russian satellite had a missile
of the intercontinental class
behind it. The two extra
‘stages’, of Jupiter-C, and the
new fuel used to propel it, give
it at least twice the range of
the standard medium-range
missile. If, hypothetically, it
were fired for warlike purposes
from the American mainland,
however, this means no more
than that instead of plopping
down halfway across the
Atlantic it could probably
strain about as far as Shannon.
The Americans still lag an
indeterminate, but lengthy,
period behind the Russians in
their attempts to get a really
long-range weapon. For a time
Russian missiles are still going
to be able to hit the United
States from Soviet territory,
while the Americans can only
retaliate from bases overseas
which they have to coax their
allies into letting them use.”
The same : “From a scientific
point of view, Explorer and
Sputnik I are of approximately
equal value. The Americans
have shown greater skill in scal-
ing down the electronic equip-
ment and instruments to fit a
container 6in. in diameter and
one-sixth of the weight of
Sputnik I. This cannot conceal
America’s inability, so far, to
launch a satellite weighing as
much as Sputnik I (1841 b.) still
less of matching Sputnik II
(half-a-ton). In rocket tech-
nology, Dr. von Braun
estimates the Americans are
five years behind Russian
engineers, although in
electronics and guidance
Explorer suggests the two are
level.
“In the race for space, the
immediate purpose of the
satellites —which is the con-
tribution they are intended to
make to the International Geo-
physical Year —tends to get
overlooked. Sputnik I and
Explorer are small-scale proto-
types designed to establish
whether a satellite was work-
able, to test radio-links with
the ground and provide some
data on the shape of the earth,
the density of the atmosphere
and the hazards facing an
object in space.
“Sputnik I and the promised
bigger version of Explorer are
fully - instrumented floating
laboratories. They are designed
both to look downwards —to
study the shape of the earth, its
magnetism, its atmosphere, its
clouds and storms —and to look
outward —to study the sun and
stars, the dust, cosmic rays,
meteors, micrometeors and
interplanetary gases of outer
space free from distortions
imposed by the atmosphere.
“Fascinating though such
information may be to geo-
physicists, it is no longer the
driving force behind the break-
neck effort to plant American
and Russian spheres of influ-
ence among the planets. The
imagination of politicians and
military alike has been stirred
by unnerving possibilities of
robot reconnaissance- and
communications - satellites,
manned space-bombing-plat-
forms and the like. Intensive
paper studies of such projects
are already in hand. Explorer
and Sputnik represent the first
tentative probing to find out
how much of this is within the
realms of engineering possi-
bility and how much should
properly be left to space-
fiction.”
German
Support-costs
Commenting on the annual
bickering over the payment
by Germany of support-costs
for British troops stationed in
Germany, London “Financial
Times” considers all the facts
“overwhelmingly in Britain’s
favor”:
“The cost of the British
troops in Germany amounts to
£125 million. The £5O million
which the German Government
is being asked to pay represents
the foreign-currency expendi-
ture on keeping the troops in
Germany. It could at any
moment be saved by bringing
the troops home.
“The British case was sup-
ported by the report of the three
independent experts which was
in its turn accepted by the
Atlantic Council. The three
experts found that Britain had
a contractual obligation to keep
these troops in Europe, and
that this was causing a heavy


additional strain on her balance
of payments. The Atlantic
Council accepted Britain’s right
to call on her allies to meet this
strain. In practice the claim
falls on Germany.
“In addition, the build-up of
Germany’s own defence-
expenditure has been very slow.
Apart from support-costs, last
year’s German defence-expendi-
ture was only about £4OO
million, or a quarter of the
British. If this year’s appropri-
ation is fully spent, which
seems most unlikely, it will rise
to about half the level of British
defence-expenditure. In addi-
tion, the £l7O million of defence
orders which Germany envis-
aged spending in Britain has
been nowhere near reached.
The original German view that
no support-costs should be paid
amounted therefore to a sub-
sidy of Germany’s defence to a
total of £125 million by Britain.
“Plainly such a situation is
intolerable. In German political
terms it is understandable.
These forces are kept in
Germany because the German
Government wants them to
defend German territory. Yet
they started off as occupying
forces, and the German elec-
torate is understandably reluc-
tant to appreciate the distinc-
tion. In economic terms the
German position is indefensible.
Germany’s reserves are now
very much larger than Britain’s,
partly because Germany has
spent so little on defence.
Britain cannot afford to subsi-
dise Germany, and there is no
reason on earth why we should
do so.”
An American opinion (N.Y..
“Herald Tribune”) supports the
“Financial Times”:
“The West German Army has
been growing—but it is very
far from the goal of 12 divi-
sions. Five divisions, at two-
thirds strength, available for
limited service, have thus far
been placed at Nato’s disposal.
This is certainly not enough to
protect West Germany from
an incursion from the East.
“Under these circumstances,
West Germany should continue
to pay sqpport-costs until its
own forces have reached the
target-levels. There is no
injustice in such an arrange-
ment. Bonn has the strongest
- economy in Europe, with a
bulging surplus of payments,
thanks to its vigorous export-
trade. It has been accepted as
full partner in Nato, with one
of its own generals, Hans
Speidel, in command of Nato
-ground - forces in Central
Europe. The support-costs are
a contribution to West
Germany’s defence, as well as
to that of the Nato community,
and are thus one aspect of the
Bonn Government’s respon-
sibility to its own people and
those of its Nato partners.”
Of incidental interest is- the
opinion of “Industrie Kurier,”
which, notes “Manchester
Guardian,” is the first German
paper to take the British side:
“Britain and France could
with some justice point to the
slow pace of German rearma-
ment, it said. The conditions
under which it had been
agreed to renounce stationing-
costs by 1958 at the latest had
not been met.”
A differing and long-range
view is put by London
“Economist,” which recalls that
“previous bouts of support-cost
fever have been accompanied
by similar noises-off”:
“Each year in the past Herr
Schaffer said ‘never,’ and each
year he paid. But this year the
London "News Chronicle”
DEUTSCHMARK UBER ALLIES
Germans’ resistance seems
more determined. In the past,
with the Bundeswehr far behind
schedule, they had no case for
refusing. Now, even though the
new tax-concessions once more
give an impression of bulging
wealth, defence spending is eat-
ing into both Budget and
national income. The 10-billion
marks to be spent on defence in
the coming fiscal year will be
some five per cent, of the
nation’s domestic expenditure.
In two years’ time the share will
rise to seven per cent., com-
pared with Britain’s eight or
nine per cent, today.
“The British case is weak-
ened by the fact that reductions
in Rhine Army are going
steadily forward ; 13,500 troops
will have left by March;
Western European Union has
had to accept the fact that a
further 8500 will be gone by
mid-1959. At one time this
country could argue: pay
your money, or the troops go.
Now the British Government
apparently wants it both ways.
“Sooner or later Britain will
have to face two realities:
that the maintenance of
adequate forces in Germany is
a British as well as a German
interest, and that their cost,
once Germany’s 12 divisions
and air-force are in being, will
have to be carried by the
British Budget alone. The
price of this annual dispute
during the transition is growing
ill-will and mutual resentment,
the effects of which are felt far
outside the defence field.”
U.K. Aircraft Industry
Further to the problems of
the British aircraft industry
noted here last week, Edin-
burgh “Scotsman’s” aviation
correspondent makes some
interesting comments on
possible developments in the
market for aircraft, his main
theme being the danger of
rushing into the immensely
expensive development of
turbo-jets when turbo-props are
doing nicely:
“The nagging dubiety of the
economics of jet-airliners
remains for the moment.
“To dwell on the dismal
prospect of jet-aircraft, carry-
ing 100 passengers at 650
m.p.h., losing money for their
operators, is to incur the wrath
or scorn of manufacturers and
the noncommittal silence of
airline sales-executives.
“In a few years the airlines
have hastened —or been
hastened —through the promis-
ing introduction of the turbo-
propeller engine into a helter-
skelter contest for pure-jet
equipment. The economy of
the turbo-prop, has been
proved in the air ; the relative
attractions of jet-power are set
out on paper. On the North
Atlantic highway, at 40,000 ft.,
the jet-airliner is to make its
fortune and bring New York
and London within six hours
of each other.
“One of the features publi-
cised by prospective jet-
operators is that the new fleets
Will have a high utilisation rate,
two round trips a day, offering
faster travel at weather-clear
altitudes to more people.
“This follows the assump-
tion that the annual number of
airline passengers is going to
continue to climb, perhaps by a
20 per cent, increase each year
(it passed the one-million-
mark in 1957 on the North
Atlantic). Yet to date there
have never been as many
passengers as there were seats
available—in 1956 the average
load-factor was 64 per cent.
“It has been admitted to me
by an airline sales-executive
that there may well be a satura-
tion-point in airline travel, a
limit defined by the level of
fares and, quite simply, by the
fact that long-distance air-
travel will not become a habit
of the average holiday tourist.
“Could it happen that opera-
ting costs will not be enlarged
and that inflation will set its
own brake on the airliner’s
speed?
“For the industry, bearing the
first financial risk that of
construction —a cut-back in air-
line re-equipment would be as
serious as the cut-back in
defence orders.”
After noting the excellent
service given by existing turbo-
props—and that, while fast jets
may be a matter of national
prestige, so is “commercial
solvency” the Edinburgh
“Scotsman” writer suggests
another avenue which might be
explored with profit. This is
the search for an aircraft to
replace the magnificent old
work-horse, the Douglas DC-3
—“there is a valuable market
for a short-haul aeroplane
which is cheap to buy, cheap to
fly, robust and airworthy in
all conditions”:
“Much of the world’s airline-
network has been spread with
this machine [the DC-3].
“The first of the 10,000-odd
which were built flew in 1935
and the type has endured
because of its simplicity and
low cost.
“A modest project on similar
lines might usefully focus the
attention of the British industry
on opportunities for Celling
large numbers of a multi-
purpose utility aircraft.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Assimilation of Aborigines
Assimilation -of aborigines
into the white community is a
delicate problem in any area
where there is any considerable
number of these people.
Kempsey, on the N.S.W. North
Coast, has received simultane-
ous bouquets for housing
schemes for the colored people,
and brickbats over the refusal
of local aldermen to allow
aborigines general use of the
municipal swimming-pool. The
ban is stated to be on health
grounds, but whatever the
reason, the statement of one
alderman, that, if colored
people are indiscriminately
admitted, it will not be long
before very few whites use the
pool is certainly correct.
There are anomalies. Colin
Faulkiner, a colored lad whose
golfing prowess has received
mention in Bulletin columns,
has been admitted to member-
ship of the Kempsey Golf Club.
This club has always exercised
keen judgment in the election
of its members, and the admis-
sion of Faulkiner may be
accepted as proof of his appar-
ent potential as a good citizen.
As a student at the Kempsey
High School he may use the
pool, with his school, but if he
was invited by a visiting golf
celebrity to join him in a swim,
Colin would be forced to
refuse, or suggest the river as
the venue.
The example is not an
isolated one. Several others
of aboriginal descent are pro-
ving their worth in various
fields locally. Why not allow
such persons to apply for a
certificate of full citizenship,
which would confer on them
equal rights with all others? A
local committee drawn from
police, doctors and local-
government authorities could
handle the applications, and
such a scheme should provide
an incentive to those who wish
to help themselves. At present
it appears they are being
pushed back to the lower level
of their less ambitious fellows.

Steam Locos
Much as I admire “Trans-
porticus’s’’ championship of
steam-traction on railways, I
can’t see that the facts he gives
(B. 22/1/’5B) would cause the
Ebasco people or any modern
railway administration to look
more favorably on 43-year-old
steam-locomotives.
Railway history tells us that,
with light loads —say, 100 tons
—steam-locos in 1847, under
Brunei and Gooch on England’s
Great Western Railway, were
running scheduled speeds of 60
to 70 miles per hour. In the
great East and West railway
races in England in July, 1895,
the L. and N.W. railway-engine,
the Lady of the Lake, with
single driving-wheel, touched
90 m.p.h., although its load
was a very light one of four
coaches.
Modern railway administra-
tion demands more from its
locomotives than mere speed,
important as that aspect may
be. Recent statements from
some of Australia’s railway
commissioners indicate the
trend of power-traction on Aus-
tralian 'railways. Thus N. Mc->
Cusker, N. S. Wales Commis-
sioner for Railways, states that
diesel-electric locomotives have
trebled the mileage for
steam - locomotives steam -
locos run an average
of 40,000 miles a year;
diesels are averaging 144,000
miles. Electric locomotives on
the Western line were averaging
35 m.p.h. on l-in-33 gradients,
compared with 13 m.p.h. for
steam. This was the basic
reason for electrifying the
Horns by-Gosford line, which
has heavy grades.
P. Hannaberry, Common-
wealth Commissioner for Rail-
ways, is an enthusiastic
champion of diesel - electric
locomotives, and no wonder!
Since their introduction on the
Commonwealth system, he has
seen the financial position
change from a loss on the Trans
“After Working thirty-five years in a cold-store you have to retire to this!”
in 1951 to a working profit
of £680,183 for 1956-57, and a
profit on the whole Common-
wealth railways for 1956-57 of
£1,364,337. This improvement
is attributed to the progressive
introduction of diesel-electric
locomotives.
I am nostalgic myself about
the disappearance of steam, but
if diesel-electric and electric
traction had not been invented,
many railways would have
been out of existence by now
and many railway-engineers out
of a job.— George Beeslex
(N.S.W.).
Uniform Traffic-code
At last responsible bodies are
becoming aware of the value of
a uniform traffic-code covering
the whole of Australia. A cen-
tury ago it might have been
bearable to have regulations
which varied—not only within
Australia, but even within State
boundaries —but the growth of
communications has converted
this forest of regulations into a
legal maze.
As usual it is not the fault
of the legal profession.
Imported and locally produced
experts on traffic-control have
trampled through the country
apparently oblivious to the fact
that they would need the
specialist knowledge of a
lawyer if their many, and
occasionally useful, ideas were
to be put into effective
operation.
Insofar as traffic-regulation
can reduce the number of road
accidents there are two essential
requirements: first a uniform
traffic-code, with which every-
one must be thoroughly
familiar, containing a series of
signs giving warning of unusual
or dangerous road-conditions ;
and, second, efficient
administration of such a code
so that every danger-spot
carries the appropriate warning
and every breach risks detection
and punishment.
Without those two essentials
the genius of experts is wasted,
no matter how appealing it may
appear in the board-room. We
are now sufficiently experienced
to tackle both tasks, but the
first is so vital that it must be
approached carefully. The code
must be as uniform as possible,
not only in area, but in dura-
tion. It is difficult to acquire
a familiarity with legal rules if
they are frequently being
changed, and one of the
greatest problems in post-war
traffic-control has arisen from
the facility with which pre-
mature amendments have been
made to existing rules only to


be rejected when their
inadequacy was demonstrated.

The Cairo Conference
The 500 delegates who
attended the Afro-Asian meet-
ing in Cairo represented some
42 countries and every shade
of political pigment, from red
and half-red to pale pink and
immaculate white. Of course,
these delegations were the
spokesmen of groups, mostly
Leftish, and were, except in
one notable case, not repre-
sentatives of their respective
Governments. The one excep-
tion, was, naturally, the com-
pletely equipped team from the
Soviet Union, which was in
this instance —as in the case of
the so-called Solidarity Con-
ference held in 1955 in Delhi
—sponsored by the Inter-
national Bureau of the
U.S.S.R.
The obvious reason for the
earlier “Solidarity” gathering
was that of a prelude to the
Bandoeng Conference of 1956,
which was made up of duly
accredited Government delega-
tions of whom the Soviet
Union was not a member. But
the absence of a participant
from Moscow did not mean
that the Russians did not have
a few observers ; and from the
reports of these latter, the
potentialities of future gather-
ings of the same ethnographical
character must have filled the
Moscow propaganda - chiefs
with seething enthusiasm.
Although the Bandoeng Con-
ference was called ostensibly to
deal with problems affecting
Afro-Asian countries (backward
in economic and cultural
development and whose terri-
tories lay along or below the
great tropical belt that stretches
from the Atlantic to the Pacific
Ocean), on the face of it no
exception could be taken to the
presence of any country invited
whose geographical position
was within the implied title of
the conference at Cairo. Indeed,
Russia could rightly claim to
represent a number of un-
developed areas within its
Asian orbit for example,
Outer Mongolia, Turkestan
and Azerbaijan.
As to the proceedings at the
Cairo gathering itself, the
general tenor was one of con-
demnation of everything that
was not compatible with
Moscow’s avowed approval.
The attitude of the West
towards disarmament, Nato,
the “Eisenhower doctrine,”
colonialism and so forth, gave
ample scope for the fulmina-
tions of the Soviet speakers and
their fellow-travellers. On the
subject of imperialism, in addi-
tion to violent attacks upon
those Powers still retaining
sovereignty over extra-Euro-
pean territories, the Soviet
spokesmen supported con-
demnation of all trusteeship
under U.N.0., demanding the
immediate granting of full
independence to the indigenous
peoples concerned. However,
every care was taken to fore-
stall any reference to the
Russian hegemony over those
Asiatic territories mentioned in
the foregoing, or to others
held in subservience by Russia
and Communist China.
As an alternative to the
Eisenhower plan, the Soviet
delegation made fulsome
promises of Russian economic
aid to all and sundry of the
countries within the ambit of
the conference —a climax to a
feast of unrestricted propa-
ganda yet unsurpassed in the
whole gamut of Moscow sales-
talk.
While it is true that many
of those present at the Cairo
conference were unlikely to be
gulled by either the exhorta-
tion or blandishments of the
Soviet demagogues, there is at
least one cogent fact to be
remembered in connection
with this gathering.
At its conclusion it was
decided to establish in Cairo
a permanent secretariat
charged with sustaining the
continuity of the so-called
solidarity movement among
Afro - Asian peoples. This
organisation is, of course,
sponsored by Moscow and
will be most certainly financed
from the Kremlin. This means
that whatever the immediate
outcome of the Cairo gathering,
the fact remains that Russian
Communism has established a
formidable bridgehead on the
African continent, from which
sorties will be made into every
territory between the Medi-
terranean and the Cape of
Good Hope. Fred Aarons

Trams
Sydney transport-authorities
did not need the example of the
extensive, profitable and
practical tramway-services of
Brussels, Melbourne or New
York to guide them (B.
5/2/’5B). About 30 years ago
Sydney had what was then
recognised as the finest tram-
way-system in the world.
Buses do not move a given
number of people over a given
period as effectively, cheaply or
comfortably as trams, even if
“Can I drop you somewhere ?”
they do move them more
speedily. Speed should not be
regarded as the first essential of
public transport in city or sub-
urban thoroughfares utility
and comfort are more
important factors.
Tram-services in Sydney
almost certainly were sacrificed,
and are still being sacrificed, for
the benefit of the private
motorist and at the expense of
the general public. Trams
admittedly are more obstructive
to road-traffic than buses, and
it obviously was and is the
purpose of Sydney transport
authorities (private motorists to
a man themselves) to remove
these obstructions as smartly as
possible to permit freer flow
of motor-traffic, irrespective of
the utility or continued public
patronage of the trams.
It is vain, of course, to bewail
lost tram-services overhead
wires are torn-down and rails
torn-up—but the voices of local
members and local councillors
should be heard before any
more tram-services are discon-
tinued in Sydney.—P. O. M. C.
(N.S.W.).
The Politician on Tour
An advertisement in the
local provincial press to the
effect that the Federal member
would be in attendance at
certain centres at certain times
on appointed days to inter-
view constituents “with pro-
blems requiring Parliamentary
attention” makes me curious
to know what such problems
could be. Apparently there
must be many unsolved
problems of that nature to
justify a politician setting
aside a week to visit 17 centres
remote from his home-town
for such an altruistic purpose,
Nevertheless, such an
implied offer to use Parliamen-
tary prestige and privilege to
accomplish something
unattainable through normal
official channels rings hollow,
and it would be interesting to
know the extent of log-rolling
(if any) and the degree of
success attained,
it is understandable that, in
war-time, worried parents and
w i ve s turn hopefully to a poli-
tician in an attempt to
influence a decision regarding
a son or husband ; but it does
seem a reflection on the able
administration of the public
service to suggest that represen-
tations by a Parliamentarian
are required to ensure that
officialdom does the right
thing.
The rubber - stamp, “For
draft reply for Minister’s
signature,’-’ endorsed on the
correspondence by his private
secretary is familiar to depart-
mental and Service officers,
and, whether he knows it or
not, the reply received by the
politician over the Minister’s
signature, and passed to the
constituent, has been prepared
in many instances, by the
official with the final say in the
first place,
I suppose the practice of
arranging meetings with con-
stituents outside the village
post-office, or over at the local,
is a variation of kissing-the-
baby of former, more
picturesque days. S. J.

One of our most eminent nuclear scientists
remarked recently that the conservation of water
is more important to Australia than the introduction
of atomic power to its industries.
Let us weigh that statement, coming as it does
from an authority who is in a position to assess the
enormous benefits to be shed on mankind from the
use of nuclear power.
It underlines our big conditioning problem:
Before Australia can think of advancing fully into
the atomic age, or the space age, it must settle
once and for all this question of water shortage.
After ten lush years, with the land stocked to
an estimated 150-million sheep and 17-million
cattle, the truth peeps out again at first onset of a
dry spell.
Certainly we are better equipped now to
withstand the effects of erratic rainfall. The science
of rain-making in clouded areas is more advanced.
Other brilliance in the C.5.1.R.0. has given us the
means of minimising the evaporation of water
stored. Federal and State agencies are paying
closer attention to the control and development of
our water resources. And research into water
problems is being done by a privately and
industrially endowed foundation.
But all this effort combined, admirable as it
separately is, does not cancel the fact that Australia
is still parched periodically for the want of water
that has been allowed to run to waste, and even, to
cause destruction, in seasons of plenty.
Because of the depth and formation of this
country, an adequate system of water conservation
is a huge undertaking. The cost will be great. But
we have to face it. And as for the cost —what is
that, compared with the decimation in stock that
past droughts' have caused, or the economic loss
that future droughts and floods will bring unless
the water is held?
The atomic age is upon us. Change upon
change awaits us. But first —and this is basic—
we’ve got to be big enough to get a national water
programme properly under way.
A SKETCH OF HUGH McCRAE
[From an article by Norman Lindsay on the Red Page, 20/4/’49.]
TJUGH McCRAE’S reminis-
cences of our early
Melbourne days in his Story-
Book Only arrived with a
special nostalgic charm to
me, for they revive memories
of Hugh himself, and it
would require his own vivid
and unexpected turns of
phrase to define the effect of
his personality as it burst on
our studio group of that era:
an eruption into it of exuberant
vitality, an insatiable gusto for
adventure of life, in a key of
tremendous laughter.
That laugh of his —a gift. So
were his robust body and
astonishing good looks: in-
herited from that glamorous
lady Georgiana through his
father, George Gordon Mc-
Crae, who was one of the
handsomest old men I ever met.
And the most gracious and
courteous.
I think I can best define the
quality of Hugh’s personality
and appearance by the fact that
from his very first arrival
among us we accepted him, not
only as a rare and remarkable
being but as a rare and
remarkable poet.
Only Boswell could recreate
a posthumous Hugh McCrae.
That freakish and exuberant
fancy which is the peculiar
charm of his prose is really an
intrinsic quality of Hugh him-
self.
I recall especially some of
the tricks he played on poor
Harry Garlick in those early
days when Hugh and I shared
a house together at Lavender
Bay. Harry was a minor artist
of that era, and a contributor
to The Bulletin of joke-
blocks which had to do mainly
with monkeys and carthorses.
He used to drift round to our
place of an evening, and thereby
constitute himself the perfect
subject for Hugh’s art. I wish
I dared recount some astound-
ing instances in the love-life of
old ladies as recounted by Hugh
to Harry, which so dazed him
that I recall him saying help-
lessly, “But is that really a fact,
Mac?” and being assured in
the most trenchant terms that
it was, on Hugh’s personal
observation and experience.
What of those pranks of his
when he was in the Melbourne
Censor’s Office during World
War I, when he frequently
drove those asses of censors
into a frenzy of spy-detection
by ringing-up the office in a
Teutonic accent with a request
for permission to send an
allegedly innocuous package
out of the country uncensored,
or sent them slinking at mid-
night to Prince’s Bridge to an
assignation made by telephone
with a mysterious lady who
would be identified as wearing
a red rose in her hair and carry-
ing an arum-lily in her left
hand, and who had informa-
tion to impart in the best spirit
of William Le Queux or
Phillips Oppenheim? What of
his stagecraft over Mick Paul’s
discovery of a glass eye in a pie
in a celebrated Sydney eating-
house? What of—-
But this is to encroach on
subject-matter which is Hugh’s
exclusive property.... The
charm of his prose is that
it owes nothing to conscious
stylism, but slips off his pen as
naturally as an act of breath-
ing. When entertainment value
is added to high quality of style
in a prose work, it gives us all
that a work of art can give.
It is a gratuitous generosity
when a poet adds prose to his
poetry. And the poetry of
Hugh McCrae has one especial
claim on our gratitude and
reverence. It is the first poetry
written in this country which
has the quality we call ‘‘major.”
Nobody Home
[This fragment of fantasy by Hugh
McCrae came to The Bulletin in
the J?brm of a letter a few years ago.]
T AST Monday night, at a
quarter to twelve, I woke up
—breathless—and climbing out
of bed switched on a light in
order to reach the dressing-
table where medicines are kept.
As I stooped across the
drawer I glanced into the
looking-glass to see if I
appeared half so ill as I felt;
and saw — nothing. Chairs,
pictures and a table were
reflected; but not a sign of
myself. I became frightened,
and stared downward to catch
a glimpse of my actual physical
body. Again it didn’t exist.
Then I thought that I dreamt
and was still in bed; and,
hardly daring, looked. But I
wasn’t there.
Now, I’m still not any-
where !
What should I do?
Call out for help? Battle
the door and send for the
housemaid? Better, perhaps,
to ring the police? “Anybody
knowing the whereabouts of
Hugh McCrae,” and so forth,
and so forth.


and shining new padlock. Then
he exploded with a voice that
rocked round the hillside.
“By the suffering ants if
that’s not the lousiest, rottenest,
lowest thing to do to a man!
You son of a suffering sea
reptile, you’re as mangy as a
rotten dog! You mean, rotten,
yellow-bellied dingo, you’re
lower than a snake’s belly!
You up-jumped son of a sea-
mule and a spineless donkey,
if I can get my hands on you
I’ll turn you inside-out and use
your rotten hide for me dogs
to sleep on!”
He glared round the country-
side. But the landscape was
barren of movement, and
Brost’s house was hidden by the
hill. “You lousy, raspberry
mongrel! ” Bardy yelled to the
empty air, waving the bullock-
whip about. “I’ll bet you re
holed-up somewhere watching!
Well come out and fight like a
man! Come down here and
give us a go at you, and when
I’m finished wifh you you’ll be
like something dragged home
by the cat from the garbage!
Come on, you dingo ; give us
a go at your rotten hide! I
won’t kill you first up. I’ll leave
a bit for your wife an’ kids to
howl over.”
Not getting an answer or
even glimpsing his enemy,
Bardy leaned wearily against
the gatepost; the rotten,
wooden gate, hanging tiredly
on one hinge, suddenly leant
over.
Bardy surveyed it with
interest. It was now only a low,
wide barrier to his team’s home-
ward progress. But something
stirred in his memory. Brost
had some sort of legal claim
to this gate, even though Bardy
couldn’t recall what it was. In
a way Bardy respected the law,
particularly when it was on the
side of coots like Brost.
Then he noticed that the cows
in the team were getting rest-
less and he looked up at the
westering sun and back at their
distended udders. It was nearly
milking-time. He lit his pipe
and grinned, shouldered the
whip, climbed through the
fence and walked off down the
road without looking back.
Around the first bend he sat
down in the shade of an iron-
bark and waited. Half-an-hour
later the team came round the
bend.
Bardy fell into step beside
them happily. There was no
doubt about it, you couldn't
stop well-trained cows getting
to the bails when milking-time
came round . . .
Late that night Bardy got
out of bed, walked up the road
in the dark, raked the pieces of
the smashed gate together
around the post and set fire to
them. The fire blazed fiercely
and Bardy watched it from a
distance with satisfaction,
Brost was going to be hopping-
mad after this lot.
TT was nearly ten-o’clock next
morning when Bardy saw
Brost and Kenny approaching
down the foad. Bardy was
waiting on the edge of the
veranda and said over his
shoulder into the kitchen,
“Visitors, Mum. But we won’t
be wanting any tea.”
He chuckled at his humor.

“One of these days he's going

‘ One of these days they’re
going to lock horns and there’ll
be hell and feathers flying,”
Maud said heavily. “They’re
both like a magpies’ nest, full of
twigs and droppings.”
Bardy’s daughter had no
illusions about her father and
Brost. She looked out the
window and saw Ken. For a
moment her heart skipped a
beat, then settled back into
grimness. She didn’t like the
way the father and son were
approaching. She glanced out
the door at her father.
“What've you been up to
this time, eh?”
Bardy shifted uneasily on his
seat. “Nothing.”
“Oh yeah?” Maud said. “Ip
about ten-minutes we’ll know.”
“Well, don’t forget to stick
up for your father,” Bardy
admonished her.
“I’ll stick up for whoever
sticks up to being a man,”
Maud said tartly, tossing her

management.
Much of the information
is highly specialised. Glanc-
ing through the volume, one
comes across headings like
“Reproductive Anatomy and
Physiology of the Ram and
Ewe,” “The Feeding of Breed-
ing Ewes and their Marking
Percentages,” and “The Selec-
tion of Merino Sheep for
Greater Productivity.” This
reader found Professor G. L.
McClymont’s “Drought Feed-
ing” very interesting indeed.
As the title implies,
“Drought Feeding” is a guide
to successful sheep-manage-
ment during drought; more,
perhaps, than that: it is a
broad and informative article
on the economics of feeding.
Professor McClymont is Pro-
fessor of Rural Science at the
University of New England,
A r midale.
A sheep owner on
the northern table-
lands of N.S.W. has
found the feeding of
two of his orphaned
lambs no problem.
They have been
adopted by a Jersey
cow and are being
fed regularly by their
foster mother. The
owner has no objec-
tion to this arrange-
ment since it saves
him the trouble of
first milking the cow
and then filling
bottles to feed the
lambs. Such lamb
care is to be highly
commended as is also
the wisdom of using
Elastrator Rubber
Rings when lambs are
to be marked and
tailed.
Drought - feeding,
McClymont says, is always
something of a gamble; and
he lists a few relevant
factors: —
Keeping costs of feeding as low
as possible—
(а) by feeding the cheapest source
of feed;
(б) by not feeding unnecessary
additions;
(c) by keeping labor and trans-
port costs as low as possible.
Keeping up the value of the
flock —
by keeping losses as low as
possible and wool-production as
high as possible.
In feeding the cheapest
source of feed, McClymont
considers that the key factor
is the amount of energy and
protein sheep obtain from the
feed; and experiments have
shown that, provided sheep
get the same amount of
energy, they can be fed either
hay or chaff alone, hay or
chaff and grain or grain alone,
without any effect on results.
It boils down to the maxim
that minerals and vitamins, in
practice, are far less impor-
tant than energy and protein.
So the best feed is one which
provides energy at the least
cost. How to find it?
The cheapest source of energy is
found by working out the cost of
a unit of energy (a pound of starch
equivalent, or “food unit”) in the
various feeds. This can be worked
out by dividing the cost per one
hundred pounds of the feed by the
number of food units per one
hundred pounds.
As for protein:
When there is no other feed, and
the feed being given has over about
five per cent, protein, there is no
need to take protein-content to
feed into, account, except that the
higher-protein feed will give better
wool-production. All the grains,
good pasture-hay, lucerne-hay,
clover-hay, pellets, etc., contain over
six per cent, protein. Cereal hay,
generally with about five per cent,
protein, is the only common feed
that has less than six per cent,
protein.
But —and it’s an important
“but” —when there’s either a
fair quantity of low-protein
grazing, such as old, dry
strawed-off grass, or when con-
served straw is being fed,
protein-content of additional
feed is highly important.
Mineral - supplements,
McClymont thinks, are not
warranted unless feeding on
grain, or grain and cereal chaff
with no calcium-rich teed
available And McClymont
emphatically slates “much of
the current advertising on the
value of vitamin-A supple-
ments in drought - feeding.”
His theory is that all green
feeds (green - pick, grass,
herbage and scrub, and
greenish hay, such as lucerne-
or grass- or clover-hay) and
lucerne-meal are good sources
of vitamin-A ; sheep, he says,
particularly older ones, can
“You needn't bother, dear —I’ve found some gumtips .”
store-up enough vitamin-A in
their livers to last them for
many months, without recourse
to green feed. Provided sheep
have some of their liver-
reserves left, additional shots
of vitamin-A merely lengthen
the period before deficiency
occurs.
Professor McClymont’s
recommendations on vitamin-
A feeding are worth quoting in
full:
Where sheep have any green feed,
a short pick, grass, herbage, or
scrub, or over 4oz. of green lucerne
or clover-hay, or yellow corn per
day: no vitamin-A supplement
warranted.
Dry or in-lamb ewes, or wethers,
without any green feed or green hay
for up to at least 12 months: no
vitamin-A supplement warranted.
Sheep six to 12 months old: if no
green feed or green hay for at least
six months give a vitamin-A supple-
" % Kfor src en
bay f or fl ve months when mating is
two months off, give a vitamin-A
supplement (half a million units)
no green feed or green hay since
lambing, and lambs are three months
old -
On the question of when to
feed, McClymont favors feed-
ing once or twice weekly as
opposed to small daily
amounts. With weekly feeding,
when a large amount of feed
is put out, slow feeders get an
equal chance to fill their
bellies, resulting in a more
even line of sheep with fewer
losses. With daily feeding,
fast feeders tend to eat more
than their share,- forcing the
slower ones to go hungry.
Intermittent feeding also
helps in reducing costs: not so
much labor and transport
involved. And, by using
mechanised aids such as grain-
silos, grain-augurs, troughs and

Hand-feeding which allows
appreciable losses, McClymont
says, is uneconomic.
A 20 per cent, loss in a flock
means up to 20 per cent, increase
in cost of feeding per head of the
survivors. And a 20 per cent,
increase in level of feeding might
have eliminated the losses, and there
would not have been a capital loss
or reduction in post-drought earning-
capacity. Cost of feeding heavily
enough to keep sheep alive is offset
to a large extent by extra wool cut.
As to the quantity of feed
needed to keep sheep going in
drought - poor condition,
McClymont submits the
following table:

Altogether, a comprehensive

Science
“Linera”: Although the
more spectacular achievements
of science, such as myxoma-
tosis and artificial rainmak-
ing, are usually quoted when
pointing out the value of recent
discoveries to the nation, there
has been a good deal of steady
improvement in less-publicised
fields.
For instance, Victoria’s more
than 17 bushels of wheat to the
acre average in a lower-than-
normal rainfall-year last season
is as much as would have been
expected in good seasons not
so long ago.
In South Australia, an
unnamed crossbred oat yielded
77 bushels to the acre on 4iin.
of rain less than normal in the
growing season.
The number of Victoria’s
apple-trees is declining while
the population is increasing,
and yet the demand continues
to be satisfied, thanks to the
successful control of codling-
moth and other pests.
Although 1956-57 potato-
acreages were below normal
and shortages were feared,
enough spuds were harvested
to satisfy everyone except the
poor growers, whose hopes of
high prices were turned to
realities of low values.
Improved varieties, disease-
control and cultural practices
all contributed to the high
yield.
With still higher - yielding
crops on the way and better
control of diseases probable, the
Malthusian theory that the
population will eventually out-
strip the world’s resources
seems unlikely to be proved in
our time.
Salty Water
“Ferdy”: With increasing
interest in the use of under-
ground water, it’s useful to
know that sheep on green
pasture can stand up to 1100
grains of salt per gallon of
water ; beef-cattle, 700 ; horses
and dairy-cattle, 500 ; and pigs
and poultry, only 300.
Plants can tolerate 220 and
humans 150. There are only
seven grains of salts per gallon
in Melbourne’s water-supply—
-20 to 25 in Adelaide’s.
In general, the more saline
the water, the greater the reduc-
tion in animal-production.
Fresh water should be avail-
able for piegnant or lactating
females, young and growing
animals, working animals, and
weak stock. It is particularly
important to keep water fresh
when dams are low.
U.S.A. Pointers
“Marshall”: Electric - lights
stimulate egg-production, so
why not milk, U.S.A. farmers
are asking. Colorado scientists
are seeking the answer.
Other recent developments in
U.S.A. include:
About Is. worth of stilbes-
trol put an extra 1751 b. on
steers in 153 days at Illinois
University. The same hormone
is increasing weight-gains in
lambs, too.
Feather-meal is being fed
successfully to pigs at
Tennessee University. It costs
about the same as soya-bean-
meal, but has twice the protein.
The U.S.A. synthetic-fibre
industry has expanded 35 per
cent, in five years. Secondary
industries are spending seven
billion dollars a year in
developing new products.
Of the 53 billion [U.S.]
dollars which consumers paid
for food in 1956, two-thirds
went to the middleman.
Farmers only got half as much.
Queensland
Agricultural
Production 1956-57
Latest statistics on Queens-
land agricultural production
for the 1956-57 season show
that the total area of crops
grown in the State was
2,465,186 acres, while, allowing
for areas on which two or more
crops were grown during the
season, the area cultivated for
crops was 2,409,266 acres. In
addition, 491,796 acres lay
fallow, making a total of
2,901,062 acres of cultivated
land. Another 1,952,562 acres
were under paspalum and other
non-native grasses. The bulk
of the area of the State's rural
holdings consisted of natural
grazing areas Amounting to
360,611,023 acres, including
32,522,903 acres of improved
native-pasture and 328,088,120
acres unimproved.
The total area of crops dur-
ing 1956-57 was 5.2 per cent,
less than during 1955-56 —
2,465,186 acres compared with
2,600,134 —but was the third-
highest ever recorded. While
wheat, oats, barley, and green
fodder showed much-reduced
areas compared with the previ-
ous year, and the sugar area
was slightly down, big increases
occurred in the areas under
maize, sorghum, millet, canary-
seed, and linseed, which partly
compensated for the reduced
areas of the former crops. The
total area under all crops was
more than 770,000 acres, or 46
per cent., greater than its pre-
war average.

Nearly one-fifth of the total
area under crop in Queensland

acres of sugarcane, compare 3
with 482,145 acres in 1955-56
and 349,992 acres before the
last war (average of three years
ended 1939-40). The 1956-57.
area was exceeded only in 1954-
55 and 1955-56, and represented
an increase of about 50 per
cent, since the end of the war.
Of the total area under cane,
360,932 acres were cut for
crushing, yielding 8,978,081
tons, 12,450 acres were cut for
plants, while 106,734 acres, con-
sisting of stand over and newly-
planted cane, were not produc-
tive during the season. Cane-
yield per acre, 24.9 tons, was
slightly above that of the
previous season.
Grain
Grain-crops in 1956 - 57
occupied 106,665 acres less
than during the previous
season —1,042,881 acres com-
pared with 1,149,665 acres.
Among the winter-growing
grains, the area of wheat
showed a decrease of over
220,000 acres, barley 14,000
acres, and oats 8000 acres,
though these were offset to
some extent by an increase of
88,000 acres of canary-seed.
The two principal summer-
growing grains showed
increased acreages* maize
recording an increase of 17,460
acres and sorghum one of
16,178 acres.
The wheat-area, 359,952
acres, was much lower than in
1955-56, while production at
7,061,373 bushels was the
lowest since 1951-52. The yield
per acre, averaging 19.6
bushels, was well below the
high yields of the previous two
years. Downs division pro-
duced 85 per cent, of the wheat,
with most of the balance com-
ing from Rockhampton, Roma,
and central-western divisions.
Downs division was also the
main source of the other
winter-growing grains. In 1956-
57, the area under canary-seed
increased greatly, while barley
and oats both showed a sub-
stantial decline compared with
the previous season. The area
of canary-seed, 162,189 acres,
was more than twice that of
1955-56, and the total produc-
tion, 1,557,273 bushels, was
nearly one - and - threequarter
times as great. Barley was
harvested from 131,304 acres
and gave a total of 2,969,217
bushels, both area and produc-
tion being well below the
record-figures of 1955-56.
The area of 27,523 acres of
oats harvested in 1956-57 was
8115 acres less than for the
previous season and the produc-
tion, 552,771 bushels, was
down by 190,179 bushels, a
decrease of 26 per cent. Downs
division produced almost the
whole canary-seed crop, 92 per
cent, of the barley, and 84 per
cent, of the oats. Maryborough
and Rockhampton divisions
grew most of the remainder of
all three crops.
Of the summer - growing
grains, m'aize was for many
years the only one cultivated,
but in recent years the growing
of grain-sorghum has expanded
widely, and since 1950-51 maize
has been exceeded by sorghum
m both area and production. In
1956-57 the area of grain-
sorghum was 171,705 acres, the
second-lowest area for seven
years, but the production of
4,243,227 bushels was exceeded
only by the large 1954-55 crop.
The area under maize during
1956-57 was 125,606 acres. The
total production of 3,468,102
bushels was well over that of
recent years and was the
highest since 1947-48. The
1956-57 crop consisted of
58,789 acres of hybrid-maize
which produced 2,005,017
bushels, and 66,817 acres of
non-hybrid, which produced
1,463,085 bushels, the average
yield per acre being 34.1
bushels for hybrid-maize and
21.9 bushels for non-hybrid.
Details of hybrid and non-
hybrid were first collected for
the 1950-51 season. In that
year the area of hybrid-maize
was 14,803 acres, equal to 13.2
per cent, of the total maize
aiea. Thereafter hybrid made
up 'each year a larger propor-
tion of the maize acreage, viz.,
21.7 per cent., 23.0 per cent.,
29.5 per cent., 40.9 per cent.,
43.8 per cent., and, during 1956-
57, 46.8 per cent.
Millet, panicum, and setaria
were grown on 64,602 acres, 30
per cent, more than the area
grown during 1955-56, and the
production, 954,090 bushels,
was 28 per cent, above the
figure for the previous year.
Maize is widely distributed
throughout the State. Mary-
borough division last year pro-
duced 41 per cent, of the whole
crop, while the Downs division
with 24 per cent., Moreton 18,
Cairns 11, and Rockhampton 5
per cent., were the other main
producing - areas. Small
quantities were grown in the
other coastal divisions and in
some of the pastoral areas.
More than half of the sor-
ghum-crop came from Downs
division, and 24 per cent, from
Rockhampton. The remainder
of the crop came from Mary-
borough, central-western, and
Moreton divisions in that order,
with very small quantities also
from Roma, Townsville,
Mackay, and Cairns divisions.
Millets and panicum were
unimportant except in Downs
division, which produced 96
per cent, of the crop.
Hay
The area cut for hay during
1956-57 was the lowest for five
years and was about 21,000
acres less than the pre-war
average-area. The production
from this smaller area was
95,602 tons compared with the
pre-war average of 103,576
tons, and the average yield of
all hay was 2.1 tons per acre
compared with the pre-war
figure of 1.6 tons.
The most important hay-
crop in Queensland is lucerne,
and, t during 1956-57, 34,520
acres' produced 79,533 tons,
thus accounting for 77 per cent,
of the total hay-area and 83
per cent, of all hay produced.
More than half of the total
lucerne-hay came from More-
ton division, where the average
yield was 2.9 tons to the acre
compared with the State
average of 2.3 tons and the pre-
war State average of 1.7 tons.
Downs division produced
19,938 tons, or 25 per cent., and
Maryborough division 9509
tons, or 12 per cent. Most of
the remainder was produced in
Rockhampton division.
Other hay-crops in Queens-
land totalled 10,428 acres, from
which 16,069 tons were har-
vested. Of this, wheaten-hay
accounted for 4420 acres and
5988 tons, and oaten-hay for
2709 acres and 4583 tons, the
Downs division producing the
greater portion of both crops.
Some Sudan-, millet-, and
barley-hay were also harvested
during the year.
Green Fodder
The area of green-fodder
crops grown during 1956-57,
640,316 acres, was 49,000 acres
less than in 1955-56 and the
smallest for four years. Oats
accounted for 286,610 acres,
about 45 per cent, of the total.
Other crops grown for green-
fodder' were: Sudan - grass,
53,400 acres ; lucerne, 64,353
acres ; sorghum, 52,497 acres
wheat, 43,757 acres ; barley,
36,494 acres; millets, 21,471
acres; maize, 14,059 acres;
cow-cane, 2228 acres; sugar-
cane, 1044 acres; and
miscellaneous crops, 34,403
acres.
Two-thirds of all fodder-
crops were grown in Downs
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(13/2/’58)
Rainfall should improve in Queensland during March—
heavy rains and flooding are indicated on the north coast
and Peninsula, and these rains may be associated with a
cyclone crossing the Peninsula. Moderate to good rains
should also come to the north-west, central highlands and
southern Queensland, but poor rainfall only is probable in
the west and far south-west.
Moderate rain likely on the N.S.W. coast, northern and
central tablelands and part of the central west during March,
poor rainfall only in the balance of the State. Heavy rains
should occur on the coast during April, with general rains
in June. There is a possibility of further good rains between
February 24 and 28.
Victoria may get only light rains in March, and April
will probably be dry throughout. General rains should occur
in May, with heavier falls in June and July.
Apart from moderate rain in part of the far north,
South Australia will probably get poor rainfall only during
March. General rains should commence in May, and a good
season should follow in the agricultural areas.
In Western Australia, heavy rains are indicated in the
west Kimberleys, Fortescue and west Gascoyne areas during
March, and these rains may be associated with a “willy-
willy” developing off the north-west coast. Good rains are
also likely in the De Grey and on the central and south-
coastal regions.

division, with a total of 410,888
acre's. Moreton with 78,370
acres was next in importance,
followed by Maryborough,
77,933 acres, and Rockhamp-
ton, 40,619 acres. These
divisions all showed decreases
on the 1955-56 plantings.
Vegetables
The total area of vegetables
grown for sale during 1956-57
was 53,018 acres, an increase of
6712 acres on the 1955-56 area.
The area grown for use on
holdings as animal-fodder,
9710 acres, fell by- 1055 acres
following a decrease of 1080
acres the previous year, the
main decrease again being in
pumpkins, from 8170 to 7654
acres. Other vegetables grown
lor use on holdings as fodder
were as follows: sweet-
potatoes, 847 acres; turnips,
691 acres; mangolds, 398
acres ; and miscellaneous vege-
tables, 120 acres.
The four most important
vegetables grown for human
consumption all showed
increased areas compared with
1955-56, and pumpkins,
potatoes, and tomatoes showed
increases in production and
average-yield ; 12,925 acres of
potatoes produced 49,499 tons ;
5759 acres of tomatoes, 773,757
bushels ; 5877 acres of French-
beans, 652,552 bushels; and
3258 acres of onions, 14,279
tons.
There were also 16,074 acres
of pumpkins grown for sale,
including a proportion prob-
ably used for animal-fodder,
from which 35,515 tons were
obtained. There were 9125
acres of other Vegetables grown
for sale, an increase of 439
acres on the previous year.
The navy-bean area remained
much the same as during 1955-
56, 994 acres compared with
1016 acres, but the production,
9677 bushels, was more than
three times the 3135 bushels
harvested the previous year.
Beetroot, cabbages, cucum-
bers, carrots, green-peas, and
turnips all showed increased
area and production during the
12 months, while slight
decreases in both area and pro-
duction occurred in marrows
and melons. The area and pro-
duction of the great variety of
other vegetables grown are
individually small and fluctuate
only slightly from year to year.
Fruit
Fruit-crops in 1956-57 were
grown on 42,477 acres, a
decrease of 1692 acres from
the area of 1955-56. Orchards,
plantations, and vineyards of
bearing age occupied 29,917
acres, and young fruits not yet
of bearing age occupied 12,560
acres, compared with 31,904
and 12,265 acres respectively
during 1955-56. The small
increase in young-fruit areas
was principally in young-apple
areas and, to a lesser extent,
in young-pineapple areas. Most
other young-fruit areas showed
reduced acreages.
The area of bearing pine-
apples was 7758 acres, a
decrease of 713 acres from last
year’s record area, and
3,336,986 dozen fruit were pro-
duced, over 700,000 dozen less
than last year’s record produc-
tion. The average yield of 430
dozen to the acre was also well
below last year’s record yield
of 477 dozen to the acre. The
bearing area of bananas was
942 acres less than during
1955-56, while the production,
525,307 bushels, was nearly
101,000 bushels less.
Moreton division produced
80 per cent, of the banana crop
and more than 50 per cent, of
the pineapples ; Maryborough
division produced 10 per cent,
of the bananas and 34 per cent,
of the pineapples ; and the other
coastal divisions all produced
small quantities of bananas and
pineapples.
Apples, with 5868 acres of
bearing fruit, nearly 4 per cent,
over the previous year, came
next to pineapples in extent of
area. This crop is confined to
Downs division, 97 per cent,
of the total area being within
the Stanthorpe Shire. Though
the yield of 123 bushels per
acre was high, it was well below
the previous year’s record
figure of 130 bushels per acre
and the production of 723,297
bushels was about i\ per cent,
less.
As for apples, the season was
good for citrus fruits, though
the results were not as good
as those of the previous year.
Production of 584,661 bushels
from 404 bearing acres with
an average yield of 133 bushels
to the acre was over 10 per cent,
lower than the record reached
in 1955-56. More than 55 per
cent, of the citrus crop was
produced in Maryborough
division, and about 31 per cent,
in Moreton. Rockhampton,
Roma, Townsville, and Cairns
divisions accounted for most of
the remainder, but small
quantities of citrus are pro-
duced throughout the State.
Tlie area of grape-vines of
bearing age, 2627 acres, has
remained practically unchanged
during the last four seasons
but the quantity of grapes pro-
duced during 1956-57, 7,700,536
lb., was 2,300,0001 b. more than
during 1955-56 and a record
for the State.
Downs is the principal grape-
growing division, but small
quantities of grapes are grown
commercially in most divisions
of the State. The following
fruits are confined almost
entirely to the Downs division,
Stanthorpe Shire: peaches,
1149 acres, yielding 73,280
bushels; plums, 1010 acres,
49,739 bushels; pears, 323
acres, 56,028 bushels; and
apricots, 235 acres, 16,170
bushels. In most instances the
production was well below that
of 1955-56.
Custard-apple trees in bear-
ing occupied 218 acres (mostly
in Moreton division) from
which 25,789 bushels were
obtained, while 486 acres of
bearing mango-trees produced
26,750 bushels of fruit, the most
important source of this fruit
being the Bowen district. Paw-
paw-plantations in bearing
totalled 920 acres and produced
an above-average crop of
406,348 bushels. The main
sources of pawpaws are the
Moreton division, near Bris-
bane, and the Rockhampton
division, near Gladstone, but
some pawpaws are grown com-
mercially in most coastal areas
from Cairns south.
Miscellaneous Crops
In addition to the crops pre-
viously mentioned there were,
in 1956-57, 151,720 acres of
other crops compared with
115,282 acres during the preced-
ing season. The increase in
area was mainly due to
greatly increased plantings of
linseed. During the year
86,265 acres of this crop yielded
352,871 cwt. of pure seed. The
area of linseed planted each
year has fluctuated greatly since
112 acres were first planted in
Downs division in 1947-48. The
area expanded rapidly to reach
28,580 acres in 1951-52 and
then fell until in 1953-54 only
3647 acres of linseed were
planted. During 1954-55 the
.area rose to 15,569 acres, in
1955-56 to 45,202, and in 1956-
57 the area was nearly doubled.
Downs division produced 97
per cent. of the crop,
Maryborough, Rockhampton,
central-western, and Moreton
divisions accounting for the
remainder.
Peanuts occupied 25,017
acres, 6476 acres less than
during 1955-56, and produced
19,434,4601 b. of nuts. The
average yield of 7771 b. to the
acre, though higher than last
year, was still well below
normal and little more than
three-quarters of the pre-war
average yield ; 74 per cent, of
the crop was produced in
Maryborough division, while
Cairns and Rockhampton
divisions produced 15 and 17
per cent, respectively, with
small quantities from Downs,
Moreton, and Peninsula
divisions.
Increased plantings of
tobacco brought the area of
this crop to 7029 acres, an
increase of 728 acres on the
previous record area in 1955-
56. Nearly 53 per cent, of the
tobacco area was in Carins
division (Mareeba Shire), 28
per cent, in Downs division
(Inglewood Shire), and 17 per
cent, in Townsville division
(Ayr Shire). Small areas are
also cultivated in Maryborough,
Rockhampton, Mackay, More-
ton, and north - western
(Etheridge Shire) divisions. The
production was 4,344,1271 b. of
dried-leaf giving an average
yield of only 6181 b. per acre.
Cotton area and production
decreased to 11,338 acres and
3,809,0791 b. of seed cotton,
both well below the previous
year’s figures. The average yield
of 3361 b. per acre was the
lowest since 1951-52. Rock-
hampton division accounted for
76 per cent, of the cotton pro-
duced, while Downs, with 11
per cent., and Maryborough,
with 7 per cent., were next in
importance. Small quantities
were grown in all divisions
except Mackay.
Other crops grown included
9392 acres of sunflower-seed,
5261 acres of cow- and field-
peas for seed, 3434 acres of
Sudan-grass for seed, 1115
acres of lucerne for seed, 382
acres of arrowroot, 369 acres
of vegetable-seeds, 318 acres of
nurseries, and 1800 acres of
miscellaneous crops.


Women's Letters
SYDNEY
After three days of devastating
humidity, during which the languid city
seemed to be able merely “to get by,”
cool breezes swept away the heat on
Friday, a new vigor came to the aid of
the citizens, and the Queen Mother
arrived, to be greeted by an alert and
enthusiastic city. During her brief stay
she had many opportunities of seeing
Sydneysiders in all walks of life, and,
from all, her own graciousness brought
answering friendliness.
In all the engagements which the
Queen Mother undertook during her
Sydney visit, only one gave the general
public an opportunity to see her in
evening-dress. This was the State recep-
tion on Friday night, when the crowds
outside the Town Hall and the guests
within were thrilled by the sight of a
fairytale figure which quite outshone
everyone else in the hall.
Her dress was of stiffened tulle,
appliqued all over with lace medallions
in white and sky-blue. Pearls, sequins
and rhinestones enriched the whole
design, and diamonds sparkled from her
tiara, her six-tier necklace, her pendant
earrings and her brooches. Miniatures
of the late King George VI and of the
Queen were pinned to the deep-blue sash
which marks the Order of the Garter.
Long white kid-gloves and an evening-
bag embroidered to match the dress com-
pleted an ensemble which was the per-
fection of glamor.
However, it was the freshness and
poise of the Queen Mother herself that
commanded admiration above all else
As she entered the hall with the Premier
her smiles greeted guests on every side,
and having reached the dais, when the
National Anthem had been played, her
glance took in every part of the hall.
Members of Parliament had already been
presented to her in a reception-room
upstairs, and now the first person to be
presented was Chief Justice Sir Kenneth
Street, followed by church representatives
and members of the judiciary with their
wives.
It was interesting to see how each
greeting seemed to hold something
personal for her Majesty. Now and
again she would hold someone in con-
versation for a few minutes, as when
she commented on the Africa Star
worn by Mr. Justice Le Gay Brereton ;
but at all times she gave the impression
of being interested in the persons pre-
sented. When the presentations were
over, she moved among the guests, greet-
ing about every fourth person and chat-
ting informally and with friendly warmth.
The assembly was well-dressed on the
whole, though there were very few new
spectacular gowns to be seen. White
dresses predominated, with pink a good
second. Among those who wore white
were Mrs. Ernest Turnbull (in a satin
sheath), Mrs. David Lloyd Jones, Mrs.
Arthur Gollan (in a beautifully draped
chiffon dress), Mrs. Norman Jenkyn
(whose enormous “powder-puff” organdie
dress was the most bouffant to be seen),
Mrs Roy McCaughey and Mrs. Bruce
McFarlan (both in satin and diamonds),
and Mrs Tom Bateman (who covered
white nylon dress with a scarlet
taffeta coat)
H . McNall, who was one of
first (o arri chose orchid .
pat t er ned with grey, and others who
wore pink were Mrs. R. G. Pollard, Mrs.
P. D. Hills and Mrs. E. O’Dea. Combin-
ing the white and pink was Margaret
Cahill, the Premier’s daughter, who wore
a beautifully-cut dress of white satin,
embroidered with pink flowers.
The decorations of the Town Hall
rested on a motif which combined the
waratah and the flannel-flower with
streamers of rose, thistle and shamrock.
Heraldic shields on the pillars and at
the side of the stage gave the regal touch,
while a very pretty “hedge” of massed
roses stood around the dais.

A phenomenon of increasing incidence
in Sydney’s social life is the high-priced
charity “do.” Gala film-premieres have
accustomed people to paying (or hearing
of others paying), say, five-guineas for a
single ticket, not forgetting the party
and premiere of “Round the World in
80 Days,” for which the tickets were £5O
each.
This week’s function of this kind was
in aid of the Royal Blind Society, and
was organised by the Black and White
Ball Committee. It was a fashion-parade
and cocktail-party, tickets being four-
guineas each. This gave one the
privilege of seeing Toftmonks, the
famous home of Mrs. Penfold Hyland at
Elizabeth Bay, together with the art
treasures and antiques gathered therein ;
of viewing the autumn collection of Mel-
bourne’s Le Louvre; of getting a breath of
fresh air on a sultry day, since Toftmonks
offers a wide front to all the Harbor
breezes ; of seeing Mrs. Penfold Hyland’s
daughter Rada (Mrs. Paddy Russell)
modelling sack-line dresses with swiftness
and dash, along with Mrs. Simon
Warrender (she was Pamela Myer) and
Mrs. Sam Fink, who flew up from Mel-
bourne for the occasion ; of consuming
champagne, caviare, liverwurst, lobster
and other choice titbits, and of contribu-
ting to the £790 which was raised for the
Royal Blind Society. Mrs. Penfold
Hyland, by the way, covered all expenses,
including the pretty Eastern fans which
every guest received —a brilliant notion
on a boiling-hot day.
# # #
Another “do” coming up shortly
which shoulck'excite a good deal of atten-
tion is the gala-premiere of “The Cherry
Blossom Show” at the Empire Theatre
on Friday, March 14. This spectacular
show from Tokyo is billed as introducing
the modern theatrical arts of the East,
and features beauteous Japanese girls.
The entire gross proceeds of the opening
night are being donated to the Royal
Blind Society, and the committee of the
Black and White Ball, headed by Mrs.
Marcel iDekyvere, is organising the sale
of the seats, for which the prices are £5,
£3 and £l.

The fashion-show season is gathering
momentum, and there is even more
interest than usual in what is to be worn
for winter. The Lions Club is organising
what should be an authoritative show in
aid of the Victor Maxwell Nursery for
Blind Children. It is to be held at the
Trocadero on February 26 at 2.30 p.m.
and will feature fashions by Christian
Dior and Yves St. Laurent through The
House of Youth. Tickets, one guinea
each.
CANBERRA
Cheering crowds greeted the Queen
Mother when she arrived at the National
War Memorial to take part in a wreath-
laying ceremony at the start of her busy
final day in Canberra. After an inspec-
tion of the memorial she opened the
fourteenth biennial conference of the
British Empire Service League at the
Albert Hall—one of the main objects of
her visit to Australia.
When thanking the Queen Mother,
conference-chairman Sir George Holland
jokingly asked her if she recalled telling
him she would like to open the con-
ference “before getting into a wheelchair”
when he suggested it to her in London in


1953. She laughed, and replied that she
did.
After the opening, a champagne recep-
tion was held at the nearby Hotel
Canberra —the traditional “family party”
of the 8.E.5.L., always attended by
Royalty. The Queen Mother was wel-
comed by the Governor-General and
Lady Slim, the Prime Minister and Dame
Pattie Menzies, Sir George and Lady
Holland, and Sir Ernest and Lady
Harston. The reception-room was attrac-
tively decorated with blue gladioli and
pink carnations. Among the delegates
from 23 countries were Mr. and Mrs.
D. L. Burgess (Canada) and Mr. and Mrs.
O. M. Samuel (N.Z.), while Sir Raymond
and Lady Huish (Queensland) were
among the Australian delegates. Her
Majesty sipped champagne and chatted
gaily with the guests and later returned
to Government House for luncheon.
The Queen Mother’s last engagement
for the day was to attend a dinner-party
given in her honor at Canberra House,
residence of the U.K. High Commissioner
and Lady Carrington, by the High Com-
missioners of eight Commonwealth
countries, at which the chief host and
hostess were the High Commissioner for
India, Mr. P. A. Menon, and Mrs. Menon.
For this occasion the Queen Mother wore
a magnificent diamond-and-ruby tiara
with matching necklace and earrings.
Lady Harston, wife of the honorary
secretary of the British Empire Service
League, Sir Ernest Harston, is visiting
Canberra with her hubsand for the
League conference. She has taken a keen
interest in B.E.S.L. affairs for many years
and is closely associated in League
activities with Countess Mountbatten,
whose hubsand. Earl Mountbatten, is
Grand President. Lady Harston has been
in Australia for several weeks and hopes
to see more of the outback before return-
ing to her home in England.
The A.C.T. branch president of the
R.S.L., Mr. R. D. Hull, and Mrs. Hull
entertained delegates of the B.E.S.L.
conference to cocktails at their Mugga
Way home prior to two dinner-parties
given to celebrate the conference-opening
—one, at the Hotel Canberra (all-male),
where the Governor-General was guest-
of-honor, while the other was at the
Commonwealth Club, where the wives
entertained Lady Slim.
MELBOURNE
Melbourne will be a city transformed
for the arrival of the Queen Mother
tomorrow (Feb. 27). Rains have restored
the lawns in St. Kilda Road and
surrounding Government House from a
browned-off condition to their customary
verdant state. The Moomba decorations
will add their attractions to the bunting-
splashed scene.
One of the busiest spots has been
Government House, where Lady Brooks
has been directing the renovations to the
suite her Majesty will occupy. The sitting-
room and bedroom are carpeted in mush-
room-pink ; in the former, the deep settee,
easy-chairs and curtains are in pink
glazed-chintz patterned in a matching
floral-design. At the windows are hang-
ings of spring-green satin-brocade, and
there are small .Sheraton tables and a
writing-desk. The walls match the pale-
pink wallpaper of the bedroom, which
also has deep easy-chairs; these are up-
holstered in pale-pink chintz, patterned
in white clematis and green leaves to
match the window-drapes. The bed, with
its blue blankets, is covered with a spread
in mist-blue Italian brocade, criss-crossed
to make a diamond shape ; the centres
of which are embroidered with a white
flower. This spread is scalloped and
finished with white satin bobble-fringe,
and the bed-head is padded with the same
blue brocade.
☆ ☆ ☆
Lady Brooks was at Cranlana, the
Toorak home of Mrs. Sidney Baillieu
Myer, for the first meeting of the execu-
tive and committee of 100 women work-
ing for the Cancer Campaign. Mrs.
Baillieu Myer is chairman of the group;
deputy-chairmen are Mrs. Norman
Sheppard and Mrs. Maurice Nathan, hon.
secretary is Mrs. Ronald Marriott, the
hon. treasurer Mrs. Colin Clarke. As
patroness, Lady Brooks is appealing to
all mayoresses and wives of shire presi-
dents to organise money-making func-
tions to aid the campaign. Tentative plans
have been made by members of the
women’s group for several card-after-
noons, dances, fetes, a children’s party and
a Louis XIV dinner to be held during
the campaign months of May'and June.
On May 2 a dinner-dance will be held at
Cranlana, and Dame Mary Daly is
organising an evening card-party to be
held in the Melbourne Town Hall on
June 26.

The Moomba Dinner Ball, proceeds
of which will go to the Royal Women’s
Hospital Cancer Equipment Fund, will
be held on March 11 at St. Kilda Palais in
the presence of the Governor and Lady
Brooks. Tickets are £2 12s. 6d. each;
ticket-secretaries are Mrs. Tom Carlyon
(UY1015), Mrs. Graham Nathan
(UY7394) and Mrs. Wallis Tresise
(UY5037). Decorations will be in the
Moomba tradition, with the vice-regal
table springing a real surprise.

less than a three-pounder,
swept curving into a pool
between high banks. There
was a six-foot drop into the
water on the side where the
bull was, and what was annoy-
ing the bull before we wandered
along was that, because of the
drop, and a barbed-wire fence
downstream, he could not get
at his fifty wives in the
neighboring paddock.
He couldn’t get at us, either
—so we thought—because of
the six-foot drop ; and, fishing
safely from the far bank, while
he screamed and tore up the
ground or ran to and fro,
horribly rumbling as he sought
for some way of crossing the
deep pool below him, we
thoroughly enjoyed the spec-
tacle of his fury. We were,
though, in the midst of our
amusement a little awed at a
frenzy so majestic, a rage so
completely ungovernable.
That was when he surprised
us. He leapt clean into the
water. It was like an elephant,
like a locomotive falling from
the skies —such a colossal
splash, such a surge of the
current, such a stream of
sudden spray. It was a thing
unheard - of, impossible ; it
broke all the rules for the
behavior of bulls ; it was an
explosion. Like fragments from
the explosion, we departed.
Half-an-hour later, when,
with extreme precautions, we
crept back to retrieve my land-
ing-net which I had dropped
in mid-flight, the bull had also
departed: he was downstream
fighting with the last fence that
held him back from his harem.
MO such excuse, the pres-
sure of extreme tenderness,
could be offered for the Jersey
on the Awakino, for he was in
the midst of his wives when he
tackled my brother Neil and
myself in our tent beside that
broad and beautiful stream —
rainbow-trout water it was.
My brother, for reasons with
which I am more inclined to
sympathise now than I was
then, was strangely indifferent
to fishing. The vCry first time
I took him out, to introduce
him to the art, he caught a
magnificent five-pounder in the
Waitara, somewhere at the
back of Inglewood, yet even
that triumph—l can still see
him wrestling with his short,
unhandy boy’s rod while the
fish swirled and leapt in the
current and while, dancing
around him with excitement,
I implored him to let the reel
lun free —did not turn him into
an angler ; and on this trip to
the Awakino he staggered me
(away upstream in ragged wild
rocky country, at a big blue
pool where Caleb Maslin, Fin’s
father, was reputed never to
have missed taking a fish) by
abandoning the sport altogether
one day to go hunting on the
cliff for ferns.
But if he was more a botanist
than a fisherman, there were at
least two episodes on that trip
in which Neil took, perforce,
the same impassioned interest
that I did: the stew and the
bull.
The stew —what a concoction
it was! Its chief ingredient,
born out of vague memories
of my mother’s making pea-
soup, was a ham-bone, with
large hard cubes of ham for
reinforcement. We stole a
cabbage from a farmer’s field
near by, and put that in. We
stole some silver-beet, and put
that in. We stole some turnips,
and put them in. Two or three
eggs, some mint from the river-
bank, and a small, rather limp,
rainbow-trout. When it was
more-or less cooked it looked
too thin and watery; and
indeed, with the hard lumps of
ham floating about among the
cabbage and silver-beet like
petrified' snails in a flooded
garden, it failed, somehow, to
attract us. It needed thicken-
ing. We had one of our
mother’s delicious Christmas-
cakes, so we squashed it up
and, for the thickening, put
that in.
Then we ate it.
What groanings upon the
river-bank, what contortions,
what hideous scenes took place
later that night I hesitate to
describe. But it was, in its way,
a remarkably successful stew.
The bull—he was a great
success, too. We camped that
trip, as so often before and
afterwards, on a flat beside a
grassy lane that ran down to
the river-bank from a side-
road ; and it was the custom
of that bull, a truly gigantic
Jersey, to come roaring down
the road with his cows every
afternoon as they were drift-
ing of their own accord —for
we never saw anyone in control
of them—to their evening milk-
ing. The first time we saw him,
bellowing his way down our
lane, we simply bolted across
the river—a most sensible thing
to do.
The next time —we usually
got back to our tent for a break
between the day’s and the even-
ing’s fishing just when the bull
was due —some fatal spirit of
defiance, some indignation at
being driven away from our
own territory, must have taken
hold of us. As he entered the
lane trumpeting, we ran up and
threw a stone at him. That
pleased him very much: here
was opposition, here was sport.
He began to lumber towards
vs. We threw more stones.
Overjoyed, he broke into a run.
We retreated to a position
beside our small tent, and
from there cannonaded him
again. He gave the most
tremendous roar of exultation
and charged straight at us.
There must have been time,
though he would have been
hard at our heels, to make a
break for the river ; but in our
panic we did not think so and
with one accord we dived into
the tent —instantly to realise,
of course, that a tent, a sheet
of thin canvas, is no protection
whatever.
We lay on the grassy floor,
trying to squeeze under our
frail camp-stretchers, and
quaked with terror while he
searched for us.
Where had we disappeared
to? That was obviously
bothering him; indeed, annoy-
ing him., We could hear him
searching. We could almost
hear him thinking. Were we
in that bush? In the earth?
In that curious white thing
perhaps?
He dug the ground for us,
bellowing; shaking our frail
habitation to its roots, he
stumbled over our guy-ropes ;
worst of all, he sniffed for us.
He was at the side of the tent
now. If we tried to escape
either from the opening at the
front or by pulling up the
canvas at the back and sliding
under it, he would have us
before we could reach the river
one way or the trees across the
road from the other. If we
stayed where we were, inglori-
ously under the beds, any
second mow he would burst in
upon us. By signs and by
whispers we concocted a plan.
Clearly, from the lumberings
and groanings outside, he was
exploring towards the front of
the tent. Very well, then, the
instant he showed in the open-
ing, we would wriggle out the
back and away.
And that is what we did.
Only it was then, in that intoler-
able suspense as we waited for
the monster to poke his head in
our front door, that I began to
laugh ; in a whisper, it is true,
but still to laugh; and tha
made my brother almost as
mad as the bull was.
It was, I suppose, hysteria on
my part; though I have found
in other emergencies that some-
thing will rise up in defence of
the dignity, of man when things
get utterly impossible, detach-
ing one from the ignominy of
terror or disaster, making them
—almost—laughable.
At any rate, I laughed; and
my brother silently groaned;
and the bloody great bull poked
his head in the front of the
tent; and out the back we
slithered and galloped up the
lane to the road ; and I didn’t
stop till I was through the
fence and safe beside a climb-
able macrocarpa-tree ; and my
brother didn’t stop running at
all —the last glimpse I had of
him he was a mile away up the
main road . . . hurtling, as I
afterwards found out, to protest
to the farmer, with all the con-
siderable indignation he had
accumulated, at the molestation
of two innocent fishermen by
his bull.

did, did I? Did you see me
do it? Now let me warn you,
Mr. Brost. This is getting to be
legal. Did you see me do it?”
Brost, taken aback, paused to
consider that aspect; he came
back angrily: “I locked that
gate after you went up the road
with your bullock-team yester-
day. You must have smashed it
down to get home.”
“Ho! ” said Bardy. “So that’s
your argument, eh? Now let
me tell you something, Mr.
Brost. In the first place I
haven’t got a bullock-team. But
me cows were up that way
yesterday afternoon. And if
you locked the gate when they
v/ere up there then you did the
wrong thing. You know what
cows are like when it gets
round to milking-time? They’d
just bust their way through any-
thing to get to the bails to be
eased of their milk.”
Brost’s face turned purple.
“You can’t put that over me,
Bardy! Who burnt me gate?”
“Now, this is something,”
Bardy said heavily. “First you
accuse me of smashing your
gate down, now you insinuate
that I burnt it. Now just what
do you mean?”
Brost’s mouth worked with
rage. “You can’t put that over
me, Bardy!- I’m going to put
this in the hands of me
solicitor.”
“Look,” Bardy growled
threateningly, heaving himself
upright. “I’ve had you, Brost.”
Rolling up his sleeves, he
advanced with slow purpose.
Brost backed off, squealing
“Snap it, Kenny! Snap it!”
Maud’s voice cufiin on them.
“Look out, Dad, he’s got a
camera! ”
Bardy glanced at the youth
levelling an old box-camera
with a shaking hand.
“If it comes to blows,” Brost
shrilled. “I’m going to have
legal evidence! Watch him,
Kenny! ”
“Ha! ” said Bardy. “So that’s
the strength of it, eh? Well, if
you want a photo-finish, cop
this!” He swung wildly at
Brost’s jaw ; and missed.
“Snap him, Kenny! Snap
him!” Brost’s voice rose to a
falsetto as he pranced about the
road ; the dogs stalked about
on stiff legs with th6ir tails
straight out behind them.
Above the din Maud’s voice
reached her father.
“Into him, Dad ; knock the
daylights outa him!”
And with a wildcat-like
spring she landed, clawing at
the hair, on top of Kenny.
They crashed to the ground
with Maud on top wielding her
arms in no uncertain manner,
and the men and the dogs
disappeared round the corner
of the shed.
Maudie got up first and did
a wild dance on the camera.
When she had flattened it she
stalked off into the house, her
head in the air, and, peering
through a crack in the wall,
watched the battered youth
sneak homewards.
Bardy came back dusting his
hands and with a satisfied grin
on his face. And the dogs
looked as if they had had an
extra issue of good bones.
Mrs. Bardy said she was
upset properly with all the
goings-on and hoped it
wouldn’t come to a law-case.
“Law-case me foot,” said
Bardy. “He hasn’t a leg to
stand on.”
'THE electricity extension into
Brown’s Road went
through rapidly. In a matter of
days a line of poles down the
road with three glistening
copper high-tension wires on
their tops swerved round the
back of Bardy’s barn and along
to the transformer.
There had been no sign of
Brost since the day he’d come
marching to war with a
camera. Bardy wasn’t worried.
It usually took his legal-minded
neighbor a good week to make
up his mind to go and see his
solicitor after a row. By that
time Mrs. Brost would have
herself and the kids worked up
to such a state they’d all be like
eggs frying in hot fat. But
when they came out Bardy
intended to put on a good
show; scare the daylights out
of them properly.
On the Friday the Brosts
came out. When things were
bad between them and the
Bardys the Brosts made a
special occasion of their exit
from Brown’s Road. They’d
sneak down from their home in
the old battered utility, and a
hundred yards from Bardy’s
Brost would slam the old truck
into second-gear. Mrs. Brost
and the kids would take a firm
grip on whatever was stable in
the truck, Brost would put his
foot down hard on the
accelerator, and they’d rocket
through the Bardy bottleneck
in a cloud of dust and smoke.
The dogs heard the Brosts
coming. They got out on to
the road and sneaked along the
water-table ready to escort the
“I distinctly heard that arch fall!”
blockade-runners through with
suitable sounds. The fowls,
who mostly foraged on the
road anyway, moved uneasily
to the side, squawking and fly-
ing about in pretended alarm as
the coughing ute in its cloud of
dust and smoke appeared, the
madly-yelping dogs racing
madly on either side.
At the approaching noise,
Bardy raced out with his shot-
gun and let fly both barrels at
a crow, a speck in the sky in
the far distance, and the Brost
kids, clinging for dear life in
the back of the ute and half-
paralysed with fright, let out
pent-up breaths and yelled
joyfully: “He’s missed you
again, Dad! ”
the same sort of per-
formance took place in
reverse #ith the return of the
Brosts from town. Only this
day Bardy missed the opening
cue and was a bit slow off the
mark.
But Maud wasn’t. She’d just
finished washing-up when the
excited fowls drew her atten-
tion to what was coming. She
shot out the kitchen-door with
the dish of greasy water and
let fly as the old ute tore past.
But her judgment was a bit
out and the stream of water
caught one of the racing dogs.
• With a startled yelp the dog
changed course for the shed
and barged through a mob of
excited fowls, so that feathers
flew in the dust and smoke and
a great hullabaloo arose just as
Bardy arrived on the veranda
with his gun.
Throwing the gun to his
shoulder, Bardy let off both
barrels without aiming at any-
thing in particular. The shot
flew over the barn and razored
through the three high-tension
wires. They came down in a
cloud of sparks and threshed
for a moment on the ground.
Alarmed at this new frightful
noise from the sky the dogs
made for the creek, while the
fowls scurried for safety under
the barn.
For a moment Bardy stood
looking at what he had done.
Then he thoughtfully stowed
the gun away behind the
kitchen-door and said quietly
to his wife, “I haven’t felt well
all day, Maggie. Think I’d
better get into bed and sleep
it off before it gets worse.”


a young strapping colonial without a
beard, but a bit soft, not necessarily a
long-jawed bony skeleton. Kate is
right enough, bar the aged look on her
face. Make her younger—a comely,
kind bushwoman The cover as it
is, if blocked large, would do excel-
lently for frightening cockatoos from
the corn.”
When Stephens suggested Kate was
depicted as worn and tired because she
had had triplets Steele retorted: “She
didn’t always have triplets” (letter
1 l/11/’O4).
Writing in “Steele Rudd’s Magazine”
(November, 1924) he criticised some of
the hairy caricatures that had appeared
in his books. “The city artist seems
to know the bushman only as a wide-
eyed, big-hearted imbecile, tramping
in a vague sort of way across a haunted
landscape with a large heavy swag on
his back, a billycan in his hand, a
swarm of flies pursuing him.” He had
told Stephens: “I blame myself for not
having long ago curst at L*eist and other
beautiful artists.”
Only Norman Lindsay “caught Dad
as I intended him” (27/10/’O3).
“Lindsay is the only man to handle
Dad if anything he cuts him a bit
short” (18/10/’O4). Lambert, who drew
the first illustration for Steele’s yarns
(“Bulletin” Christmas Number, 1895),
showed Dad as tall, thin, with dark hair
and beard. Three years later Steele
began to object to what the artists were
doing.
In the Mitchell papers of A. G.
Stephens one finds a number of remarks
by Rudd correcting artists’ errors and
misinterpretations. June, 1898, he
wrote that Mahony’s depiction of a
new-chum on horseback was “very
old-chum, most of us would think.”
July 27, 1899, he commented: “Sal
won’t do at all. She should be of the
tomboy order and sturdy ... a man’s
hat would suit her better than the one
Vincent has drawn.” Joe “shouldn’t
have boots, and his pants should be
rolled-up....”
Other letters, notably those of
14/9/’9B, 27/7/’O3, 29/9/’O3. also con-
tain criticism of the artists. Steele
never denied that their work helped
sell his books and he found much to
appreciate as well as to criticise.
But to revert to Dad. I can vouch
that Dad’s character was built from
the characters of three men the author
knew when young.
From material supplied by B. J.
Maguire, of Brisbane, the State
Electoral Office of Queensland and a
number of Darling Downs folk to
whom the Toowoomba “Chronicle”
introduced me when I was writing
Rudd’s biography, I discovered these
three men were Tom Davis, Donald
Mclntosh and Tom Allen.
Tom Davis, a Welsh blacksmith who
worked with surveying parties on the
Downs in the middle of the last century,
a blacksmith at Drayton, tin-miner at
Stanthorpe and finally selector near the
foot of Mount Sibley, close by Emu
Creek, was Rudd’s father. However,
Steele always resented any suggestion
that he caricatured his old man.
“Dad,” he wrote, “I drew from several
sources. He’s a triangle, a trinity, he
is three in one.”
Donald Mclntosh, a Scots farmer
who owned Glencairn, a few miles
out of Southbrook and not far from
the Davis family, had much of the
outward personification of Dad. A
sturdily built man with a pointed,
sandy beard, he looked patriarchal, and
when he spoke the heavy burr in his
voice commanded attention.
Mclntosh had lived at Ipswich and
Warwick before he took up land at
Eton Vale (which he sold in 1875), and
later selected at Southbrook. Elected
M.L.A. for Cambooya in 1899, he
remained in Parliament until his defeat
by Percy Bay ley in 1915 for the Pitts-
worth seat. It seems very possible
that “Donald McClure,” of “Loch
Ness,” who appeared in Rudd’s “Poor
Parson” series, was also modelled on
the character of the farmer-politician
about whom many anecdotes gathered.
The third member of the trinity—
Tom Allen —who was for many years
Returning-Officer for Cambooya, had
owned an inn at Leyburn. on the
lnglewood-Goondiwindi Road before
he selected at Greenmount East near
the Davises. None of the three men—
Davis senior, Mclntosh or Allen —in
any way resented Rudd’s characterisa-
tion. Indeed, Mclntosh enjoyed it
hugely.
“Sandy’s Selection” is concerned with
the vicissitudes of Sandy Taylor, whose
character seems to have derived jointly
from that of Tom Allen and his son
Jack, who, having wed “Jinnie” Brodie,
was Steele’s brother-in-law. Another
brother-in-law, Sandy Burton, who wed
Mary Davis, may also have been
involved.
Joe. of course, as Stewart guessed,
is Steele himself; although when A. C.
Rowlandson asked him whether he was
Joe or Dave he was told: “Neither—
but something of me is in both of them.”
L. J. Blake.
[Cecil Mann’s theory, if I understood
him correctly, is that the illustrators, by
emphasising the farcical elements of
Dad and the other characters, led Steele
Rudd into increasingly farcical writing.
It in no way invalidates this theory that
Rudd criticised some drawings and
approved of others—the general pressure
was still towards farce, and the letters
do not show any strong and consistent
objection to this treatment. —D.S.]
Arthur and Glastonbury
There was like enough a King
Arthur, but he wasn’t a king, says
Geoffrey Ashe in King Arthur’s Avalon
(Collins), a speculative walk through
the maze of poems and chronicles that
encircles Glastonbury, Somerset, site
of an ancient island-village on a lake,
of a wattle-and-daub church assigned
by legend to the first century A.D.,
which was replaced by the Old Church
of the fourth century which could
hardly have been named “Our Lady
St. Mary of Glastonbury,” since the
Marian cult did not arise until the
fifth century.
As to Arthur or Artorius, he could
have been a Briton with Roman blood,
born 470, an imperator (i.e., not an
emperor or king, but a commander-in-
chief); a cavalryman who led the
Britons in a last stand against the
Saxons invading from Wessex; victor
at Badon, where, “relying upon the
image of the mother of the Lord sewn
upon his armor, he made head single-
handed agakfst nine hundred of the
enemy and routed them with incredible;
slaughter” —this quotation being from
William of Malmesbury. As Ashe
sums it up from various sources:—
Arthur scraped together the last
remnants of Roman skill, taught the
smiths to forge armor and the troops
to manage their horses, and instituted
a mobile squadron that could hurtle
from place to place carrying all
before it. Hence the knights.
Moreover, they dug Arthur up in
1190, according to Giraldus Cam-
brensis, after Glastonbury Abbey had
been burnt down. Seven-feet down
between two columns in the old grave-
yard they found a stone slab with a
leaden cross let into the underside,
inscribed in Latin: “Here lies buried
the renowned King Arthur in the Isle
of Avalon.”
Sixteen-feet down they unearthed a
huge oak log, hollowed into a coffin;
and there they found a skeleton, the
shinbone of which was three fingers
higher than that of the tallest monk
present, and a smaller skeleton with
still a few strands of yellow hair and
a name scratched on the wood
equivalent of Guinevere. Ashe con-
siders the log-coffin an argument of
authenticity, since if the monks had
been faking they wouldn’t have known
better than to use the more modern
stone coffin.
The second of the two main subjects
in Ashe’s disquisition is the Holy
Grail; not the quest itself, but the
source of its mystery. This he finally
identifies again with Marianism, the
identification of the Chalice with
Mary, the Mother of God, the cult
which in the twelfth century “trans-
figured the arts, inspired all that was
good in the chivalric code and the

troubadours’ idealisation of
women.... ”
To these heights of legend and
philosophy the scribes of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries raised such
things as a squabble over pigs in the
bardic triads of the sixth and seventh
centuries:—
The third was Tristan, son of
Tallwych, who guarded the swine of
March (Mark) son of Meirchon
while the swineherd had gone on a
message to Essylt (Isolde) to bid her
appoint a meeting with Tristan.
Now Arthur and Marchell and Cai
(Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedevere) under-
took to go and make an attempt on
him, but they proved unable to get
possession of as much as one
porker either as a gift or as a
purchase, whether by fraud, by force
or by theft.
These are only a few strands from
Ashe’s spider-web, a story of Glaston-
bury Abbey down to its dissolution by
Henry VIII, a ruin very truly peopled
by ghosts, not merely of people, but
of races, religions and civilisations.
French History
In A History of Modem France, by
Prof. Alfred Cobban (Pelican), the
endlessly fascinating story of the
French Revolution gains a new
meaning.
Prof. Cobban demonstrates how
much the energy of Louis XIV, with
his organisation of the whole adminis-
tration and his control of France and
French possessions in his lone hand,
contributed to the ultimate failure of
the Ancien Regime. Not only were
his successors, Louis XV and XVI,
nonentities, but they failed to find a
single outstanding Minister. The
aristocracy and clergy, pushed so com-
pletely into the background by the Roi
Soleil, gradually under his successors
returned more and more to power and
eventually destroyed not only the
monarchy but themselves.
But though no great political figure
emerged, it was a period of growth in
France, the nursery of the modern
world. Ideas and social forces can be
observed emerging and growing in the
period of lack of control as they never
could have done under the totalitarian
regime of Louis XIV. Intellectual,
moral and social development all
played their part. This book, the first
volume in a series, is a very coherent
account of a very complex business.
Thanks for the Memory
Memory—Facts and Fallacies is a
Pelican book by I. M. L. Hunter in
the New Psychology series. It is an
absorbing account of the progress and
lack of progress in psychological
research into human learning, remem-
bering and forgetting. The author uses
with understanding and intelligence the
statistical approach which to so many
of his colleagues seems to become an
end in itself. Even the redoubtable
Eysenck gives a statistical account of
ethics and aesthetics which, though not
vulgar, is very funny.
Hunter describes memory as neither
an object nor a faculty but a complex
of interrelated processes. His analysis
of memorising should be valuable to
students. His own experiments and
those of others which he quotes add
considerably to the knowledge of the
subject. He deals sympathetically with
the findings of dissimilar psychologists
on repression as an aspect of memory.
But the mystery of reconstruction of
the past remains and may always
remain a mystery, he says. It is clear,
however, that it is a reconstruction
and not a reproduction. Its primary
function is not to conserve the past but
to make possible adjustments to the
requirements of the present. He con-
cludes with a useful chapter on
methods of improving the memory
.which the present reviewer is going to
try out every morning while he is
shaving if he can remember to do it.
Talking to De La Mare
Sir Russell Brain, the English
physician, began calling on Walter de
la Mare in 1942, and kept a diary of
the old poet’s conversation to De la
Mare’s death in 1956 — Tea with
Walter de la Mare (Faber).
It is a beautifully produced little
book of conversation, mostly literary,
more remarkable for its charm than
anything it says: meeting T. E.
Lawrence at tea at the Thomas
Hardys’; Beddoes doing some things
better than anyone ebe; the blue
budgerigar that had been presented to
him that “has a very Gladstonian
look”; and on words: “Take phlegm:
how expressive; Spell it ‘flem’ and its
viscosity would be gone.”
The only action in the book is De
la Mare’s fall, in 1954, when he slightly
injured his brain: because of this,
“some letters seemed inseparably fused
together—f and 1, for example, so that
if he wrote one he had to write the
other”: he also found it impossible to
imagine any room in his own house
that he could not see—i.e., when he
wasn’t there.
There is something worth while in
the picture of the famous poet’s
sitting on a jury—one member stood
out on behalf of a butcher suing a
medical officer of health: —
Finally De la Mare said: “We
must get this settled: I’ve got to
catch a train.” Whereupon the
recalcitrant juryman said: “Oh,
well, if it’s a question of a train 1
am with you.” So British, thought
De la Mare.
De la Mare, who “had had an aun
born in the eighteenth century and hi
father in 1811,” is here seen visited b>
Lord Wavell, and discussing “public
reaction to the televising of OrwelL
‘1984.’ ”

k. . the results of their persistent research . . . benefits mankind ’
No. 15 of a series—The story of BP A USTRALIA LIMITED
There are about 1000 people on the staff of The British
Petroleum Company Limited who do NOT have anything
to do with the everyday side of oil search, recovery,
refining, transportation, marketing or the administration
activities of the company.
These are the people of BP’s research staff chemists,
engineers, physicists, electronic engineers, mathematicians
and a wide range of craftsmen whose continuing job
is the discovery, development and proving of petroleum
products to suit the specific requirements of equipment
as different as sewing machines and jet engines.
Since petroleum products enter into every sphere of life
today the result of their persistent research into the
constituents of crude oil and its refined products benefits
mankind both in the home and in industry.
The place where these ‘back room boys’ perform their
scientific and technological inquiry is a 19-acre research
station at Sunbury-on-Thames, England.
The Sunbury Research Station, though, simply did not
exist when William Knox D’Arcy, an English migrant,
returned home with a fortune won from Australian gold
and a hunch that there w'as oil in the Middle East.
D’Arcy’s courage and enterprise vindicated by the
discovery of vast oil fields in Persia led to the formation
and development of the great organisation known today
as The British Petroleum Company Limited, parent
company of BP Australia Limited, and, with it, the
evolution of such activities as the 19-acre laboratory.
Truly it can be said that, thanks to the original initiative
of D’Arcy ...
began here!
