Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease. In
Anaemia—or bloodlessness—
the red corpuscles are more
or less deficient. Thus the
blood cannot provide suffi-
cient nourishment for the
body. Therefore the face
becomes white and “ pasty ”
eyes become dull and
“heavy”—and a feeling of
intense weariness pervades
the whole system. To over-
come Anaemia, the blood
supply needs recharging with
red corpuscles. And it is
here that
â

power. Because, being a
blood - maker, ‘Wincarnis’

red blood, which brings the

BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few —the more
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past or prospective events, we
may all. with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the result
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Freckles and How to Cure Them. —It is always
those with the finest and fairiest skins who
freckle most easily, but this knowledge is poor
comfort when the face is disfigured with these
ugly little blemishes. To prevent the forma-
tion of freckles a wash should be applied to
the face which will form a shield from the
rays of the sun. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by dissolving an
ounce of cleminite in four tablespoonfuls of
hot water. Shake the bottle, and when cold
apply to the face and allow to dry on the
skin. If this is done every day. renewing the
application whenever the face is washed, and
a little mercolised wax rubbed into the skin
every night, freckles will not make their
appearance, no matter how hot the sun. To
remove freckles which have already formed,
apply the wax every night, rub it well into
the skin of the face and neck and leave it on
till the morning. Then wash off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water.
To Reduce a Double Chin.—To reduce a double
chin, give hard, firm massage every night with
mercolised wax, stroking the flesh firmly back-
wards from the chin towards the lower por-
tion of the neck. Do this every night, and in
the morning bathe with cold water and rub
into the skin a little parsidium jelly. This
treatment will strengthen the flabby tissues
and restore the contour of the face. Occasion-
ally a double chin is due to stooping over
books or work, but generally it is the result
of putting on weight. When the latter is the
case a few clynol berries, eaten regularly every
day, will greatly assist in reducing the super-
fluotis flesh. A glass of hot water should be
sipped after each meal.
The Hair —To Increase the Growth.—To arrest
an undue falling of the hair and increase the
growth, scalp-massage and the application of
a good tonic is absolutely necessary. Part the
hair in the centre, and, starting at the fore-
head, massage for at least ten minutes. Then
apply a tonic. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by mixing one ounce
of boranium (which can be bought at the
chemist’s) with a quarter of a pint of bay
rum. Add the boranium to the bay rum, allow
to stand for half an hour, then strain and add
sufficient water to make half a pint. Dad*
amongst the roots of the hair with a soft
sponge.
Superfluous Hair.—Dark-complexioned women
are far more frequently troubled with a
growth of superfluous half than those with
fair skins, and at the first sign of these objec-
tionable hairs steps should be taken to remove
them, or they will develop into a strong growth
which will take a very long time to destroy.
A little powdered pheminol applied to this
growth will remove the unsightly blemish,
destroying it permanently if the hairs be but
few. Two or more applications may be neces-
sary, if the growth be unusually strong, but
about one ounce of pheminol should be suffici-
ent for the most stubborn case, rheminol can
be obtained at the chemist’s, and a little
powdered alum should be obtained at the
same time for dusting the skin before applying
the pheminol.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO DARKEN THE EYEBROWS (L.M.). —
There is no dye which I could recommend as
“safe," but if you rub a little mennaline into
the eyebrows and at the roots of the eyelashes
regularly every night it will darken them
naturally, and will also increase the growth
of the eyelashes.
TO REDUCE WEIGHT (SADIE).—Yes, your
weight and measurements are certainly more
than they should be for your height, and I
quite agree that being so stout makes you look
old. I am pleased to be able to tell you of a
quick, easy and pleasant way to reduce both.
Get a small quantity of clynol berries from
the chemist’s and take one after each meal,
three times a day. Weigh yourself after one
month’s treatment, and you will be delighted
with the result.
TO KEEP THE HAIR FAIR (DORIS).—If
you shampoo your hair regularly with stallax
granules it will prevent it from turning dark.
One teaspoon of stallax is sufficient for a
shampoo, and an original packet will make
from 25 to 30 shampoos. Stallax keeps
indefinitely. [4
TO IMPROVE A DULL, MUDDY COM-
PLEXION (D.B.).—Your complexion is dull
and muddy-looking because it needs thorough
cleansing and renewing of the outer cuticle*
To do this get a tin of mercolised wax, and
with the tips of the fingers rub a little gently
into the skin, going over the entire face and
neck. Leave the wax on all night and in the
morning wash it off with a good soap (you
will find Pilenta excellent). In a month’s time
you will notice a most surprising improve-
ment. (2) Liquid pergol will prevent the
excessive perspiration of wh’cli you complain.
(3) Nothing can be done.
TO ARREST GREYNESS (FLO).—You are
indeed far too young to go grey yet. Get
about two ounces of concentrate of tamma*
lite and mix it with three ounces of bay rum.
Dab this on the hair and amongst the roots.
It will soon make matters all right.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K.).—To
whiten your neck use .iettaline. Get a tube of
this from the chemist’s and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks and you will find that the
skin will become beautifully clear and white.

History of the Prussian
Revolution—Vol. 1.
Advance proofs of the first volume of
the “History of the Prussian Revolution,” by
the talented author who writes under the
pen-name of Napoleon Schmidt, have reached
this office or are liable to reach it at any
moment. The work is to be in four volumes,
tastefully bound in half-cow, with improba-
ble illustrations. It throws a light—the first
light that has been thrown—on that marvel-
lous movement which was apparently begun
and established in a day, which ffiburisheu
exceedingly and then vanished like a wreath
of smoke.
The Prussian revolt, it appears, was a
masterpiece of organisation. A secret De
partment of Discontent was established some
time before the war as a sort of re-insurance
scheme. Carefully-selected agents let their hair
grow long, became disorderly in their attire
and assumed a wild expression by the use or
drugs, if necessary. These were the men of
action; the philosophic dreamers wore a rapt
appearance, and fell over things in the street
through having their eyes fixed on the Pro-
mised Land afar off. They met in many large
cellars, and began to enrol adherents with a
blood-curdling oath which had more entrails
in it than any other oath ever heard of. The
first 250,000 conspirators were detailed for
the purpose from the army, the police, the
civil service, the Parliament and even from
the Court. They took the oath without turn-
ing a hair, for they had rehearsed it before-
hand, but some real revolutionists fainted
when it was sprung upon them, and had to be
revived with wines, spirits and malt liquors.
The real revolutionists who were brought
in later were impressed by the long-standing
of the movement, for the roll included the
names of men long dead and the early signa-
tures had been written on faded paper with
watered ink. They were also impressed with
the vastness of the affair, its organisation,
and the way the funds rolled in from the
imperial treasury. In time the league in-
cluded nearly all the dangerous elements, so
that the police had a complete list of them.
The hour of action was to come when the
war began to turn against Germany, and a
free, semi-republican Government could hope
for better terms than the discredited Junker-
ism.
Premature movements were rigidly dis-
couraged, so many public persons escaped
assassination. Traitorous members were
executed in secret for the appearance of
the thing. If they belonged to the original
250,000 they simply disappeared. If they
didn’t belong, their bodies were found in the
river. An ominous calm raged everywhere.
When peace was badly needed and the
offers of the old crowd were rejected, rebellion
came like a disciplined whirlwind. It was a
marvel of speed and efficiency. The day the
mob converged" on tin 1 palace the real revolu-
tionists couldn’t get within half a mile of the
front, for the first 250,000 filled the boxes
and the orchestra stalls. When all the forces
within reach—lo specially-organised regi-
’ merits —joined and also rushed the orchestra
stalls, the real revolutionists, so far from
being in the theatre, couldn’t get within gun-
shot of the pay-box. The Kaiser, foaming at
the mouth, led the attack in disguise till it
was time for him to skim round by the back
door and be on his throne ready to be insulted
and deposed. The palace guard fired des-
perately at the air with blank cartridge.
Many dozen members of the best families in
Germany fell weltering in red ink and were
carried to a hospital and shoved out by the
back door en route for South America, it
being unwise for them to be seen about imme-
diately after death. Their funeral, at which
over 40,000 bricks were buried, was a spec-
tacle that beggared description. Orders for
flowers, accompanied by telegraphed bank
credits, reached the Berlin florists from al
parts of the habitable globe, and the money
came in handy.
The Kaiser-’s offer to abdicate in favor of
his son was refused. In fact the young man,
being a coarse sort of lunatic and liable to
“take a lunar” at the populace and the Pro-
visional Government, was kept out of the
secret. William 11., being sternly informed
that he would have to answer for his crimes,
was confined in a suite of rooms with a
secret back staircase, and went out after
dark, disguised as a dynamiter, to watch the
show. The personnel of the Provisional
Government was announced from a balcony,
but the only real revolutionist who got near
enough to hear anything was almost killed
through a heavy clod striking him in the eye.
All the officers of the armies at the front
recognised the new authority at once. So
did all the privates except one, who was
naturally executed. The generals urged their
men to defend republican Germany to the
last against the monarchists of Britain, Italy
and Belgium. The banner of the new order
was a blessed emblem of peace. It repre-
sented a brown cow feeding in a green field.
The Provisional Government at once asked
for an armistice to allow of the election of an
ideal manhood-suffrage Parliament. Adult
suffrage was impossible, for there were no
women in the inner circle. It had been
feared that some of them might divulge the
great secret over afternoon hot water, there
being no tea. Reluctant and only half-con-
vinced, the Allies assented to the request for
temporary repose, provided the Hun armies
retired within their own borders to recuper-
ate. The Huns were going there, anyhow,
without any prospect of recuperation, so the
advantage was all theirs. To show a liberal
spirit the Huns did more than was asked.
They evacuated Alsace-Lorraine all except
the fortresses, and left that unmanageable
place out of the election.
Meanwhile there was trouble and chaos
and untidiness in Austria. The three-headed
or tripod empire had eight revolutions on
hand—two of them official and eight merely
tattered nuisances. The official revolutions
were purely German and Magyar affairs, for
the other races couldn’t be trusted. But for
the fact that republican troops from Prussia,

EVERY motorist must face the above question.
At the end of twelve months the value of your car
will depend almost wholly upon the condition of your
motor.
That will depend mainly on the lubricating oil yoi
have used.
Motor-wear is not accidental. It results from friction.
Excessive friction is bound to follow the use of an
oil whose “body" is unsuited to your feed system , or
whose quality is of a low lubricating efficiency.
Motors differ.
No short-cut method can determine the oil best suited
to your feed requirements.
The construction of your motor must be analysed and
carefully considered.
We have undertaken this serious problem with a
thoroughness that has established our standing in the
general lubricating field.
Each year we carefully analyse the motor of each mal e
of automobile. Based on this motor-analysis, and on
practical experience, we specify in a lubricating chart

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Lasting Love.
Love of Beauty came and caught me
When my heart was young and free;
With her golden chains she bound me
In a rare captivity.
And for me she builded visions
And upsent the morning hymn;
But I know that she will leave me
When my ears and eyes grow dim.
Love of Pleasure took me captive
When the world was new and sweet,
And she mated me with gypsies
Of the tavern and the street.
With the thrall of wine she held me
And the light of luring eyes;
But her glory, too, is going,
Like the sunset from the skies.
Love of Riches for a season,
With her net of woven gold,
Took me captive, cramped my fancy,
Made my spirit grave and cold.
But I struggled, scorned her meshes,
And escaped her sordid thrall;
For I loved not love of riches
Since it is not love at all.
Love of Glory—golden captor,
Ever lauded, ever sung—•
Threw her glamor round about me
When my thoughts were wild and young.
But the things mine eyes have witnessed
With the passing of the years
Show her gold robes gashed with anguish,
And her gems as bitter tears.
Love of Beauty, Pleasure, Riches,
Love of Glory will not stay;
Love of Love it is that lingers
When they all have passed away.

Song.
Oh, someone plucked wattle high up on the
hill,
And blue sars’parilla by Moonjibah’s knee,
From lilting green uplands where brown
thrushes trill,
Someone brought wattle to me!
Someone brought wattle that sprang by the
way,
Like a mystical flame from a magical tree,
From a temple of winds where the blown
brackens sway,
Someone brought wattle to me!
Ere Night her shy legions of dream had
withdrawn,
And moon-jewels trembled their soft
gramarye,
From peaks of the peris all dappled with
dawn,
Someone brought wattle to me!
Oh, someone wove wrnttle with pink and
white thorn,
(Up, up from the heather a song floated
free),
From paths of the pixies all mantled with
morn,
Someone brought wattle to me!

Man Song.
Sheep are bred for slaughter,
And men are bred for song
To please a man’s daughter
All a summer long;
And in that merry singing
The ships put out to sea
To meet the merchants bringing
Gold and spicerie.
Sheep are bred for slaughter,
And men are bred for song;
And one man’s daughter
Is two men’s wrong;
For up will come the stranger
And out will fly the blade;
And all men’s danger
Is one white maid.
Sheep are bred for slaughter,
And men are bred for song
To please a man’s daughter
All a summer long;
But sorrow on the stranger,
Though stout of heart he be,
Who mocks the sword’s danger
That holds my love to me.

The Orchard.
I know a hill that sighs
And a long brown vale
Where the orange-blossom lies
Like a scented veil
Under the evening skies,
Placid and pale.
There stretch the citrus rows
On the hillock brow,
And a passion creeper grows
O’er the rusted plough.
Unchecked, the rank grass knows
No rival now.
For he has fared away
From the place he made—
For a day, and a long day—
And I walk afraid
As the war-horns play
And the sad lights fade.
I know a hill that sighs
With the breath of trees;
Where the orange-blossom flies
On every breeze.
Love planted them to sanctuarise.
Green memories. *

Best Move
where Cheese is concerned is to "huff”
all others and get home with
Luncheon Cheese
This is the Cheese that is always uni-
form. It comes in well filled tins and
keeps splendidly when opened. The
flavor is quite indescribable.
‘‘Rex” is a full cream cheese properly
matured and packed in solderless tins.
Try it on sandwiches or biscuits. It
spreads like butter and is fust as tasty
without butter in sandwiches.
Get a tin from any grocer.

B' ' PORE the Dodge Brothers’ Factory commenced to manufacture*
c omplete cars it was a plant that embodied an investment of
between three and four million dollars, together with the
fruits of a remarkable manufacturing experience. It was employing
some five thousand men. Probably only the Dodge Brothers them-
selves, John F. Dodge and Horace E. Dodge, know how many more
million's have since been spent and are still being spent in making
it one of the world’s biggest automobile-producing plants.
Five thousand. Dodge Brothers’ cars have recently been supplied to the
American Army. Think of fifty cars together; the quantity seems
immense. Multiply this by ten and then again by ten, and some
conception of the magnitude of this order is attained. And all these
cars have been selected for the most trying and exacting conditions
imaginable.

THE COMPULSORY LOAN MUDDLE.
The falling barometer of Acting-Premier
Watt’s reputation registers another drop in
the matter of the Compulsory War Loan
idea. Courage commands respect, even if
it is wrong-headed. Statesmanship com-
mands respect even if the statesman lacks
courage, and therefore approaches a good
purpose by devious ways. The stealthy or
sidelong or apologetic or inefficient approach to
something that isn’t worth having doesn’t com-
mand respect. In the matter of raising money
for war expenses there are two expedi-
ents, and they may be taken together or
separately. One, of course, is taxation,
and the Hughes-Watt Government hasn’t
had the courage to do that to any great
extent, also what it has done has been done
badly. Australia, supposed to be an unusu-
ally rich country, with “boundless natural
resources,” and one which has escaped the
desolation of war, has been paying 14 per
cent, of its bill with its own revenue, and
proposes to pay 20 per cent, this _ year.
Britain, with a much larger war bill per
inhabitant, and with no idiotic brag about its
wonderful natural resources, is paying 29
per cent, and the United States 33 per cent.
And what taxes Australia has raised haven’t
been duties on imported luxuries, but rather
insane imposts for the prevention of new
local industry. Also, the money that pays
these taxes is largely loan money circulated
under pretence of running a public works
policy. Having done a little for the war
out of the revenue, the other 86 or SO per
cent, must naturally be done by loan. A
loan is supposed to be a business transac-
tion. the security and the interest being
good enough to induce subscriptions. Or.
if they are not quite good enough, a State
sometimes throws in an extra inducement in
the shape of a gamble. Any State which
allows people to gamble in land values, and
winks at auctions of suburban allot-
ments, and permits the existence of race-
meetings which are only clumsy gamb-
ling devices, can’t object to Govern-
ment lottery loans on any principle, though
it may do so as a concession to clerical
hypocrisy. But the compulsory loan is an
illogical mixing of things that don’t mix.
The reasonable idea is to make the interest
high enough to bring in the required money.
If the non-subscriber is so numerous that
the subscriber has to get 6 per cent, in
place of 5, then the non-subscriber will get
his deserts when he pays his share of the
interest bill. But if it is desired to make
the world believe that the people regard Aus-
tralia’s credit as good enough at 5 per cent,
w'hen they don’t, it w r ould be as well to make
the interest 3$ per cent, right off, and
double the compulsion, and so put a still
better face on the sham.
* * * *
The Government proposal is that, suppos-
ing a loan isn’t fully subscribed, then people
may be compelled to put mtd the loan an
amount equal to six years’ income tax, calcu-
lated on the average of the last three years.
Also it appears that 33 per cent, extra may
be levied as a penalty. The folk to be pro-
ceeded against are, first, those who haven’t
subscribed to any war loan and, second,
those who have subscribed, but not “accord-
ing to their means.’’ So hardly anybody
will know whether he is an offender until
after the event. Even if he hasn’t put a
penny into the loan he won’t be a law-
breaker if other people have put in enough
pennies. And even if he has put in all the
ready money he could lay his hands on he
will be a law'-breaker if other people have
failed, and if his subscription wasn’t “ac-
cording to his means” in the opinion of the
boss tax-dictator. The result is that no
subscription is big enough to make the sub-
scriber safe, for the dictator may say it
should have been more, on account of his
unrealisable assets. And no absence of
subscription can be so absent as to make the
richest absentee a criminal for certain. The
richest man will escape provided sufficient
men of moderate means are terrified by their
ignorance of law into rushing to the breach
with absurdly large amounts borrowed, it
may be, at absurdly high interest. It is a
thrilling gamble, and a Government which
puts on the w'hole garment of snuffle when
lotteries are suggested should be ashamed of
it.
* * * *
The person w'ho rushed heavily into pre-
vious loans, taking advantage of the bank’s
offer to advance 90 per cent, of the money
and give 18 months’ credit, may have cause
to be sorry he spoke. Subscriptions to
previous loans are not necessarily an armor
of proof. If one has been a constant sub-
scriber, like the signature of the dreary per-
son wno w'rites to the papers, he may have
two instalments on his dead horse to pay
monthly, and be in a very bad position to
subscribe to a new live horse, seeing that
even on the bank’s easy terms he must find
10 per cent, of the amount in cash. He
may look like a man of means, yet for the
present be only a man of mortgage. A very
interesting situation arises as between the
man with a falling income and he who
possesses a rising one. The compulsory
subscription is six times the average income
tax for the three previous years, with a
possible penalty which will make the
amount payable eight times the said average.
It is feasible to imagine a person whose
three years’ tax record was £4OO, £2OO and
nil, because the war was bad for his busi-
ness ; also a person whose record was nil,
£2OO and £4OO, because the war did him
good. Yet the man who had become poor
and the one who had become rich would be
legally liable for the same £l2OO and the
penalty. The former may now be in the
Insolvency Court, and then the logical thing
will be to take his subscription and fine out
of the assets, if any, to the speechless ind g-
nation of the creditors and the great amuse-
ment of the bankrupt. The person who has
become suddenly affluent within the mean-
ing of the income-tax law since the date when
the last income-tax schedule was made uo
won’t be liable ; nor will the individual who
has persistently dodged his liabilities.
* » * #
And supposing there should be another loan
which is an almost total failure, so tnat
compulsion must be used freely, some really
wonderful things may happen. Any citizen
who has been earning a very big income by
personal exertion—-say, £20,000, £9OOO and
£lOOO in three years making an average of
£lO,OO0 —and has “blewed" it on paying old
debts, on riotous living, on wild cats, on fast
women and slow horses, may be called upon
to find about £ll.OO0 —10 times more than
last year’s income, and more than that of the
year before last. That kind of prodigal
won’t be worth pursuing. The man of pro-
perty but not of cash will be only on a
moderate wicket if he has to sell part of his
property, because there will be many sellers
about that time. If he is the kind of land-
hungry financier who prefers to own £lOO.OOO
worth of estate with a £50.000 mortgage
rather than £50.000 worth clear, he w’ ll be
on a very poor wicket, for the market will be
rather full of mortgages. If his large and
heavily mortgaged fortune consists of a scrap
of city land and a citv sky-scraper—the sort
of thin o- that can’t be cut up into allotments
and disposed of piecemeal—it is hard to see
what wicket he will be on.
* # * *
Probably, if it became a matter of raising
20 or 30 millions to help a lame loan over
the stile the Government would finance the
hampered folk who had a lot of dubious
security, and lend them paper money on a
second or third mortgage to subscribe with.
As for the person with no security save his
vanished affluence and h’s dissipated appear-
ance. it would let him slide. To impound his
furniture would merely be to make him a
martyr and a popular candidate on the Anar-
chist ticket. But the ordinary, in-between
sort of person would probably have a bad
time and fall into the hands of the money-
lenders. The whole business looks a muddle.
It doesn’t deal with unencumbered and port-
able wealth, but regards a. cash balance and
a hunk of wilderness in the Dim Remote and
a pearl-shelfing connection and Great Ex-
pectations Brass Mine as eouallv realisable
on their paper value. And the possible
demands aren’t based on what a citizen has,
but on what he appeared to have the year
before last, or even previously. If bv good
luck it is never necessary to get up steam on
the ramshackle engine of taxation, so much
the better for the Government’s good name.
A SLUMP IN KINGS.
With the finish of this war, whenever that
may come about, the question of Republican-
ism versus Monarchy w'ill come up for argu-
ment on a bigger scale than ever before.
That is to say, the principle w'ill come up,
for the names don’t much matter. There
have been monarchies, like Sparta during a
great part of its history, w'hen the heredi-
tary kings only had the best chance to be
killed in battle, as they w'ere expected to go
first; or, like later Poland, w'here only a
man with private means to pay his expenses
and hire a bodyguard could afford the honor,
and one monarch, w'ho escaped after giving
the billet a trial, was pursued not for pur-
poses of vengeance but as a retreating asset.
There are monarchies to-day in winch the
sovereign is only an hereditary president;
and there are still a few nominal republics
where the president is sometimes a military
adventurer with a long job, or even a life
job, conferred by himself. But, leaving out
details, the policy of peoples as against
kings, will be a live issue. For the first
time in European history—such of it
as is worth cajling history—26 European
monarchs, mostly Hun royalties large and
small, and including one Asiatic despot
located partly in Europe, combined to start
a causeless and brutish war, and to revive
in its most aggressive form a doctrine of the
Divine Right of kings, which was thought
to be almost extinct. Three European re-
publics, sundry American ones, and one each
belonging to Asia and Africa were on the
other side, along with a herd of constitu-
tional monarchies, some of which don’t
worry about the name of republicanism
because they practically possess the fact.
The Old Order of things raised a question
which the New Order was willing to let
slide, trusting to time and the chapter of
accidents. At a period when no free nation
worried much whether its neighbor believed
in the Divine Right of kings, so long as it
kept its theory for its own consumption, the
most prominent Divine Righter received a
command from his alleged partner Gott to
spread his gospel, and thereby taught other
peoples that dynasties which were in direct
communication with Gott were a world-wide
danger, and that the communication might
have to be cut off. Presidents don’t com-
municate with Gott, and very few consti-
tutional monarchs do. Thus a crusading
policy is forced on them for their own
safety.
* * * *
It is only in comparatively modern days
that republics, or really constitutional mon-
archies, became possible on any large scale.
The possibility came with the idea of elect-
ing members to Parliament, and it took a
long, long time for the world to strike that
idea even in a very crude form, just as it
was long before a Columbus arose with a
scheme for balancing eggs. England got it
in a shadowv sort of way about 500 years
ago. Scotland, as an independent State,
never got it at all. In the old democracies
so much of the nation w T as consulted as the
speaker’s voice, raised at the capital, and
not reported by the press, could reach. And
so much of the qualified part of the nation
voted as could get to the polling-booth at
the capital. When the republic expanded
beyond shouting range it ceased to be much
of a republic. Rome, in the period when
the republic was greatest, was mostly a vast
assemblage of loafers paid to listen to candi-
dates for the job of consul or tribune; paid
to vote, and with few other honest occupa-
tions. A republic could either be very
small and helpless and honest or be large
and strong and bogus. It is curious to reflect
that the Roman commonwealth might have
grown more democratic century by century,
and might be the world’s grandest and most
liberal State to-day, if the Latins, some time
b.c., had devised the system which raised
John Storey and William Webster and
Holman and Ryan .and Bruce Smith to
undeserved importance—even the system
wtrch created Tom Bent. The
might be a bad lot, but they didn’t obtrusively
represent the stipendiary loafers of the big
city, and if they chose to think themselves
gods it at least showed that they could think
something. It gave them confidence, so it
was almost a desirable illusion. Also when
excited C.ksars of the Nero type broke
loose they d d their principal horrors on the
people of the big city, because these were
nearest, which was a pleasant reversal of
old habits. The opmion of the Backblocks.
when the news spread, was that Chssar was
going strong.
» * * •*
When the simple thought of dividing a
country into constituencies, and making P.
McGarry member- for Murrumbidgee, and
when railways, telegraphs, newspapers, salary
and a free railway pass enabled P. McGarry
to represent the place in P. McGarry’s style, it
was a sign that the GoTT-kings had become
superfluous. The circumstances that made them
indispensable were extinct. Among peoples
with a fair mental development b ; g republics
are now ouite possible and have been so for
quite a long Avhile. And a republic has
obvious advantages. The President is never
an infant who requires a regent to represent
him. He is very seldom a dotard who is past
Ms job and requires only a nurse and a slop
diet. If he is a lunatic he is an inspired sort
of lunatic, else he wou’dn’t have secured his
position. He isn’t, through a long series of
Presidential marriages, the relation of all the
other Presidents, so his politics aren’t
tangled up by family considerations. He
isn’t moved to desperate deeds to secure his
son’s succession, for his son has no chance
worth mentioning of the succession. If a
successful enemy demands his abdication as a
condition of peace, his simple answer is that
he is going at the end of his temp in any case
ard a few months make no difference, so he
will go now. Therefore if, in a real repub-
lic, the bitter-enders of the nation decide to
perish in the last ditch rather than make
terms, they do it in the supposed interests of
the country, not to preserve the Kruger or
Jefferson Davis family on the throne. The
decision that the Prince of Wales shall marry
a subject signifies that British royalty has
realised that foreign family connections are
the most serious difficulty of semi-republican
and that in this respect the renubfican
habit is a good one. Unhappily 26 Gott-
given potentates failed to realise the new
situation, and, strangely enough, the bulk of
their subjects failed also. A vast deal of
money and of things more valuable than
money has been spent on their education, and
there is no real evidence that they have been
educated in the least. Hence the necessity
for interfering with their domestic affairs, and
forcing genuine self-government on them by
violence if necessary. Many Huns have died
to preserve military despotism, and now they
have to be told that a lot more will die unless
they accept the blessings of freedom. Reli-
gious persecution is abhorrent in a general
way, but when a religion includes human
sacrifices it is often necessary to prohibit it.
And when the religionists try to force their
creed on other people it is necessary to con-
vert them by any violent means, or, failing
that, to hang the priest and the congregation
and burn the church.
IN HOSPITAL, DARWIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From the wide latticed verandah of the
hospital at Darwin an irregular, unmade
track runs down through the jungle to meet
the unseen road beyond. Lounging in a
deep canvas chair on that verandah one may
listen, look and think without end —for time
is one of the few things that are cheap at
Darwin. Lying there, one’s viewpoint
embraces, to the right, that longed-for path
to the road and the company of free, pur-
poseful, gunbrowned men ; and, looking to the
left, one sees the unwrinkled water of the
inner bay. Scarlet bauhinia droops in the
square openings of the lattice that screens
the verandah from the blistering glare of the
sun. In the centre of the hospital enclosure
a huge, shady cork-tree stands. Behind one’s
head, at right angles to the main building,
runs the little wing that holds the kitchen
and the sleeping-place of the black-trousered,
impassive Chinese cook and the felt-slippered
Greek boy who serves at table. Stretching
out in perspective opposite one’s feet are the
circular pavilion for “infectious" patients,
the open shed for Asiatics —a dejected
Chinaman sits there all day immobile —the
corrugated-iron shack of the abo. servants,
and, away beyond, nearer to the sea, the
quarters of the matron and her three nurses.
The patients are of all ages and origins,
and of varied—sometimes lurid —experience.
There is old Dad, overlanding till three years
ago. He is eighty-five, broad-hatted, pyjama-
clad; his long white beard sweeping his
chest, smoking black “nigger-twist" from
morning till night. Inside the adjacent ward
sounds the hoarse breathing of Chios the
Greek, young and burly-looking, who has lain
for days purple-faced and semi-comatose,
going down gradually to some mysterious
complaint which no one of us is able to
specify. About him, at intervals, move
silent-footed, energetic nurses, and, once a
day, the grave, white-suited doctor. There is
a huge old man who has been variously a
storekeeper on the Katherine, a prospector
on the Kikiramu, in New Guinea, and a
station-manas-er in the Gulf Country. Limp-
ing and solemn-faced, a little Jap diver comes
in. is given pyjamas, and goes painfully to
bed.
Newly-risen from his bed, and leaning on
crutches, there stumps daily out on to the
verandah a middle-aged well-featured Scot,
sent from the gaol at Fannie Bay as a result
of an injury. A khaki-clad policeman visits
him daily, apparently as a matter of form,
but: more likely as a matter of friendship.
Night-time and day an intense stillness lies
over the hospital and the jungle round about.
... .It has long been dark, but I am loth to
go into the concrete-paved w r ard and creep
under my mosquito-net. Here in the veran-
dah the shadow' is faintly mitigated by the
glow of hurricane-lamps. Black Mickie,
clean-shirted, bare-footed, with his grass
armlets on and a dilly-bag round his
neck, and accompanied by Maudie, the lubra
lady-help, passes, shadows into deeper
shadow's, out towards the compound. This
morning Chios the Greek w'ent w r est. and
was laid out in the wooden shed that is the
mortuary. All day many Greeks, male and
female, from “Salonika," their near-by
camp, have come in for a last look
at the shell. One white came, too, coat-
less, vestless, duck-trousered, slouch-hatted,
riding a bicycle, his black socks pulled over
his trouser-bottoms, a foot-rule sticking
from his hip-pocket. He was the under-
taker. A minute or -so in the mortuary, a
flick or tw'o of the foot-rule, a tug of the
slouched hat to the matron, a careless leg
thrown over the bicycle, and a w'histled tune
breaking into staccato as he struck the
outside track —so he went! Once again,
in the next w'eek, he came—for Graham.
The matron, slight, determined and more
enthusiastically energetic than her slender
salary w'ould seem to warrant, pounced on
black Mickie this morning when Chios’
bed had been emptied and stripped. “You
gettem bucket, takem plenty disinfectant,
washem out ward; makem plenty clean
feller!” She fixed Mickie with a hard eye.
He grunted and obeyed. Mickie’s troubles!
He’s going “bush" on Friday (these blacks
never stay long). Maudie the lubra, 18
years old and sucking a black pipe that
looks 80, goes with him. This morning I
stole out at dawn and watched the bay lying
like a sheet of steel, a few' stakes for fisliing-
nets sticking up black from the water in-
shore, the dense jungle falling steeply to the
sand-line, a little way out tw'o pearling-
luggers moving slowly, w'ith filling sails, to
the harbor-entrance, and over all the sun
opening its fingers to release the crimson
birds of dawn and send them flocking west
to beat with brilliant wings against the
prisoning, cirrus-lined dome of sky. Two
hours later young Angus died. I rolled a
cigarette, for him only on Monday. Ilis
mother lives a thousand miles south, and he
knew no one much here.
At ten o’clock the Scot went back to finish
his time at Fannie Bay. I can see him now.
his pyjamas changed for gaol-shirt and mole-
skins, standing on the verandah waiting for
the police buggy, his shoulders bent forward
and his earnest, sombre eyes looking straight
ahead, his weight partly lifted off his injured
foot, his body motionless except that behind
his back his sinewy hands continually


twisted and untwisted his old black hat.
Poor Scotty! # #
Night will surprise the sea and shore very
soon, but the air is still warm —so warm
that I pass barefooted over the short, sweet
grass to a green hollow beneath a clump or
pontianas, facing the sea. A wide, scarlet
trail, like the sweep of some giant paint-
brush, curves down and across the western
sky. The farther shore grows fainter. There
is not a tremor in the air or a ripple in the
water. Now scarlet fades to salmon, and
that to grey. Night is here—gowned in
velvet and trimmed with diamonds. Around
the shore, a mile and a quarter away, a
wandering searchlight blinks and stares on
the sea-margin of the town proper. From
“Salonika” there comes on the still air the
sound of raucous voices, the bark of dogs, the
twiddling of guitar-strings. Across the bush
in the native compound there drones dis-
tantly an interminable song whose every
verse exactly resembles its predecessor, whose
time contains only two tones, and whose
accompaniment is the beating together of two
pieces of wood. In the maternity ward
Young Australia complains softly in com-
petition with the crooning of an old-
world cradle-song. The faint tinkle of a
piano comes from a lonely house on Myilee
Point. Back on the dark verandah old Dad
recommences; “When I was down on Pine
("reek in ’71....”
J. ALEX. ALLAN.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Land of One Hun One Vote.
Abdication in favor of a descendant is the
last resource of royal failures who lack grit;
and if the Kaiser backs off the throne he will
act according to the rules of the game. There
have been many royal failures —good men and
bad men—who died in harness, disdaining to
hand over the burden to the kid, and bolt for
a place of safety, and disclaim all responsi-
bility, and leave behind a message—“ Don’t
hit the child. He isn’t responsible. Hit
somebody your own size.’’ And there have
been royal failures of a poorer sort. The idea
is that the old Kaiser who drenched the
world in blood shouldn’t be held to account
if he has washed his hands of the whole
business, and the young Kaiser can’t be held
accountable because he is just about able to
walk, and the hanging of infants is irregular.
There is talk of William abdicating in
favor of his grandson, which would probably
be illegal, as the hereditary crown is not, a
thing to be passed to anybody at William’s
discretion. But the son and heir is middle-
aged in iniquity. He is old enough to be
hanged, and he is commonly regarded as
being, if possible, more bloodthirsty and more
loathsome than his old man. To take over
the job of Chief Mad Dog of the lloiienzol-
lern family would be to mark himself out
for destruction when he is sufficiently marked
out already. So it is best for the middle-
aged iniquity to stand aside, so that when the
Allies arrive at Berlin and demand to see the
great war boss they may be moved to pity
when the great war boss says “Goo-goo’’ to
them and asks them for a chocolate. The
weak point of the scheme is that the Allies
probably won’t allow either the Kaiser or his
eldest son to abdicate. In other words, they
may ignore the proceeding just as they will
the Russian and Roumanian treaties.
William may say on the day of reckoning
that he is a Lutheran preacher or an obscure
private citizen. His son may say that he is
a peaceful retail trader who has changed his
name to Schmidtenfeldbruggeniiauser.
And they may both point to a small
boy as the person to be reckoned
with. But the reckoning with them
will be held all the same. There is
an account to be taken with the insane and
'•orrupt and brutalised German people as
well as with their rulers, for the Reichstag
—the legislative House of federated Ger-
many—is elected on the principle of One
Hun One Vote. The idea that the people can
hide themselves behind the Kaiser, making
him the solely responsible party, and the
Kaiser can pass on the liability to a child
who can’t be held accountable for anything,
iA too thin. There have been bitter and terri-
ble wars before, but this is the first war in
which an allegedly white race devoted itself
to the systematic destruction of beauty and
art and historic places of worship. When the
adventurous son of Philip Augustus and
his French army retired from London they
didn’t dream of demolishing the Tower by
slave labor and leaving the city—a very com-
bustible one then —in ashes. The Turks did
nothing worse with St. Sophia than to turn
it into a mosque. Rheims has been a war
centre for hundreds of years, but the Hun
was the first invader who tried to demolish
its wonderful cathedral. Mexico counted
260 revolutions of a sort in 50 stormy years,
but not a shot was fired at the cathedral of
the City of Mexico save by accident. St.
Peter’s has been immune though Rome has
been occupied times out of number. Milan,
with its wonderful church, has gone through
as many troubles, and it was only once seri-
ously damaged. That was when a German
emperor destroyed it nearly 1000 years ago.
and a new Milan had to be constructed. The
men who so completely obliterated the cathe-
dral of Lens that even its site can’t be iden-
tified among the ruins, and did this, not in
the heat of battle, but during an orderly re-
treat, are in a class by themselves. So are
the men who sold Serbian children as slaves
to the Turk. They are not human, but Hun.
And because the Reichstag is based on One
Hun One Vote the bill has to be presented to
the nation. The idea that the whole burden
rests on the Kaiser, and that he can shift it
on to the infant by abdication is out of date.
A Jest About the Peace Conference.
One Matthews, a Federal Labor member,
has put in a very off-hand claim that the Aus-
tralian Labor party shall have “representa-
tives” at the great Peace Conference —not
one representative, but something in the
plural—and William Watt promised to
give the idea his affable consideration. It
was a wonderful case of looking ahead ; if
the party was half as previous on financial
matters as it is when cultivating its mis-
guided self-importance the public debt would
be a very different thing. ■ It would be pleas-
ing to know how many delegates there are
expected to be at that wonderful conference.
Is it to be a meeting or an army corps?
Australia stands for, perhaps, one-fourteenth
of the white populations of the Empire. If
it is to have five representatives, so that the
Labor party may have two on a numerical
basis— Matthews clearly expects more
than one —then the British Empire delega-
tion, on a population basis, would number
70. That is assuming that more than three-
fourths of the people—all the colored people
—were excluded. But if it becomes a ques-
tion of representing the dependencies accord-
ing to any fixed rule, India, which is three-
fourths of the Empire in itself, and is nearly
two-thirds the size of Australia to boot,
couldn’t be shut out without a dangerous
row. Also a white community like New-
foundland, the oldest dependency of all,
would want to send a man to speak for it
according to the rules of the game, and to
entitle it to one member (it couldn’t well
have half a member) Australia would have
20 and the Empire 280, saying nothing of
India. Even putting Australia’s Labor
“representatives” (plural) at two the U.S.
could demand about 90 peace ambassadors,
and France 40, Serbia five, Belgium 74,
Italy 35 and Japan 50. Also Montenegro,
Roumania and Russia would have to come
in somewhere. The affair begins to look too
big. Labor-member Matthews may have
got accustomed to large ideas through con-
templating the size of the public debt and
the cost of Australia House, but these ideas
are only good for local consumption. The
position is that separate parts of an empire,
like Australia, Hong Kong, Senegal or the
Philippines, have never possessed any status
at an international congress. The head-
quarters of the nation —London or Paris or
Washington—has always furnished the re-
presentation. In this case it isn’t in the
least degree likely that the old rule will be
altered after any official fashion. Britain
couldn’t raise the question without giving
India the right to put in a claim, and the
other nations for their own safety would
probably shut down on the question if it
was raised. But because the position is
unique certain prominent men from the big
dependencies will probably appear as repre-
sentatives of the Empire, and will be part
of the caucus of British representatives
which will decide the policy which the whole
British delegation puts before the Peace Con-
ference. On the other hand they may not
be representatives at the Conference at all,
but only advisers behind the scenes. They
certainly won’t be numerous, for these busi-
nesses aren’t done by multitudes. When
seven Powers met in 1878 the British Em-
pire had only three delegates, and it was the
bigsrest crowd. Though affairs will be on a
different scale this time the idea of less than
half of a community which is one-fourteenth
of the white Empire, or one-eightieth of the
parti-colored Empire, talking of its represen-
tatives in the plural is childish. There will
be no excited election meetings and
caucus meetings and ballots to elect
five or ten good Brookfields and Judds.
More likely a few men like Hughes and
Botha and Borden and Massey will simply
be invited. In any case it would be better
for Australia to enact that any Labor poli-
te‘an of the present gang who is found
v. if bin 1090 miles of the Peace Conference
shall be disoualified for life. The men who
want the Hun to receive back his island
fortresses at our very doors, to have his
African possessions restored so that he may
agaio be a dangerous neighbor to the Union,
and to keep Alsace-Lorraine under his heel —
the men who say he shouldn’t even pay a
fine for the horrors he has committed, and who
positively refuse to declare in plain words
that he should even pay for material damage
—not one of them is going to represent Aus-
tralia at any Conference if decent Australians
can prevent it.
The Hard Lot of Some Newspapers.
Man does not live by bread and beer alone,
he must have newspapers: and as Australia
does m t ma’o to any extent it must
import it. The cost of ordinarv nrijUurr
papor has increased to something like three
or three and a half times what it was in
1914. and the supplies have been short and
erratic. Some newspaper proprietors, with
long sight or luck —mostly luck —had pro-
vided for the bleak future. Now all of them,
the provident and the thriftless, the unlucky
and the hard-up, are faced with a compul-
sory reduction in the quantity of paper used.
r lhe Paper Controller’s regulations were
framed after consultation with representa-
tives of the daily papers and some other
interests: the weeklies not associated with
dailies, and the hundred-odd fortnightly and
monthly journals were not consulted. The
interests of these two classes of newspapers
are not always identical, and the second lot
is as much entitled to consideration as the
first. Doubtless they would have had it if
they had been organised as the dailies and
the country papers were; anyhow, necessity
brought them, or some of them, together in
Sydney last week when the Periodical News-
papers Association was formed. It imme-
diately sought representation on the State
Board of Advice: but it was born too late
to have a voice in the framing of the regula-
tions. The association, however, arrived in
time to grapple with another difficulty. A
war-time addition to the postal rates on
newspapers as well as letters was antici-
pated, but it was not imagined that there
was any prospect of discrimination against
journals issued at longer intervals than a
week. Whether the statement was true or not
it was believed that the Postal Department
proposed to deregister all newspapers issued
at anything longer than seven-day intervals.
That, following a number of other handi-
caps, would be a knock-out blow for many a
good specialist newspaper and magazine, as
it would deprive them of the postal privi-
leges they share with the dailies and
weeklies. In a democratic community there
is no reason why any distinction should be
made in the post office between newspapers
on account of the intervals at which they are
published, though distinction should be made
between mere advertising sheets or cata-
logues and those publications which are
legitimately supplying reading matter to
their particular audiences. As it is, the
increased postal rates also hit the small papers
harder than the wealthy dailies in another
way; only a very small proportion of the
dailies is delivered by post, whereas in the case
of. say, a farmers’ journal, the Post Office is
practically the sole distributor to subscribers.
Meanwhile the Paper Controller’s attention
might be directed to the vast waste in the
printing of large numbers of seven
different Hansards, Votes and Proceed-
ings and Parliamentary papers galore. They
might be issued in editions not larger than,
say, three copies of each —one for the Parlia-
ment concerned, one for the Public Library
or other mausoleum of dead printed matter,
and the third copy could be sold to collectors
at fancy prices, thereby covering the whole
cost, with perhaps a bit over.

The Home-service Badge Source of
Contention.
“Clericus” : Notwithstanding the dis-
claimer of “Got ’Em” (B. 17/10/T8), the
contention of “Ziff” (B. 3/10/T8) that the
principle adopted in granting exemption,
Home Service and other badges by the mili-
tary and naval departments is absurd, and in
hundreds of cases ridiculously unjust, is sub-
stantially correct. In the Department of the
Navy, for instance, taking the clerk as a
basis, the man on the permanent staff is sup-
plied with a badge certifying to the fact that
he is employed by the Royal Australian
Navy, whereas the temporary hand is not
entitled to this badge. In Sydney alone the
temporary employees in the clerical section of
the navy outnumber the “perms.” by at least
90 in every 100 clerks employed. (Probably
more than 100 navy clerks in N. S. Wales
have service ranging from four to 10 years,
and are still “temporary.”) Many cases can
be shown of permanent clerks, draughtsmen,
etc., with little or no family responsibilities,
who have been granted and are wearing these
Home Service badges working next to tem-
porary men (in most cases older than perma-
nent men) who have families to support.
These temporaries have been refused badges
merely because thev have not been gazetted
as permanentlv emploved. A few cases can
be found in the Defence Department which
are even worse. Men are wearing
“Required for Home Service” badges, and
openly boasting that they made every
endeavor to enlist but were informed
by the heads that they were “indispensable.”
In most cases these employees are performing
work of so arduous a nature that any school-
boy or -girl bolder of the Q.C. could do
it. It is only reasonable, therefore, to
sunpose that manv of the employees in pri-
vate companies who receive these Home Ser-
vice badges have no more right to them than
have the employees of the Cable Company,
who, on the admission of “Got ’Em,” are
supposed to be indispensable. The fact that
the women of England have for over four
years filled the breach of the same class of
“indispensable,” and are performing magnifi-
cent work, from buildin" ships to farming,
shows how “indispensable” many of these
badge men really are.
The Second Long Parliament.
Britain thinks of having an election this
year. The present House of Commons will
then be eight years old. Its original term was
seven years, which was reduced by its own
act to five; but when the war fuss began no-
body had .time for elections, and the House
simply gave itself authority to hang on.
There has been nothing like.it in England for
durab’Fty since the Long Parliament, which
died 265 years aged 121? years. It wou’d
probably be sitting yet, and handing down its
billet to its son, if Cromwell hadn’t got tired
of it and used frightful language. At the
now election women aged over 30 are to have
a vote, which will arouse great bitterness
among many women who have been 29 for a
long time. A rough and ready upheaval of
electoral boundaries has been made, for new
populations have grown up round the
munition-factories, and old ones have almost
vanished either through men go’ng to the
Front or through men. women and children
shifting to the munition-making districts.
Also there will be new constituencies, such
as were never heard of before (or at least
new pofiing-nlaees), in Franco, Belsr’um.
Italy, Macedonia and probably Northern
Russia : likewise a heaving constituency on
the sea. Possibly a member for Bagdad and
Damascus will eventuate. The armed elec-
tor abroad is now too numerous to be ignored.
The big parties will go forth on the same
Finish-the-War and Wipe-out-the-Hun pro-
gramme, and with a general assurance that
everything else is in the melting-pot and
that nothing will be the same again save
birth, marriage and death. The old Freetrade
crowd is not expected to show up to any
extent worth mentioning. Nobody will listen
to the proposal to replace the Hun on the
free list. The awful revelation of how the
happy-go-lucky or devil-may-care importing
policy had allowed the well-organised enemy
to capture industries essential to the defence
and the very existence of the nation, and how
hundreds of millions of money and hundreds
of thousands of lives were wasted so that
Britain might escape by the skin of its teeth
the ruin that the Cobdenites had prepared
for it, has made Cobden and his kind a hiss-
ing and a reproach. Britain has found by
hard necessity that it isn't nearly so depen-
dent on imported food as it imagined. The
blockade of the Russian and Roumanian sup-
plies, the miserable failure of Australia
through neglect to build ships, and other
causes, drove it to strenuous measures of
compulsory agriculture. And when it ordered
the landowner or occupier to plough up grass-
lands and parks, and to redeem the waste
country, it naturally encouraged him with a
guarantee that the State would buy his com-
pulsory crops at a good price for many years
after the war demand is ended; so a great
deal of cheap foreign grain must be shut out
to make a market for this local produce. The
silly old gag about the unlimited importation
of the foreign cheap loaf being thus dis-
qualified, there is little of his old subject left
for the silly old Freetrader to talk about.
As a matter of fact the theory of cheap im-
ported victuals and low wages is dead. The
nation has grown accustomed to high wages
and fairly expensive victuals, and it isn't
likely to change and ruin its agriculture a
second time. The Second Long Parliament
proposes to dissolve for various reasons.
About half the original members are gone—
very many of them dead. The by-elections
have largely been a matter of default; when
a patriotic Liberal or Conservative passed
out lijs party was allowed to retain the seat,
and it is felt that the people are a little tired
of this family arrangement. The need to
elect members for the new constituencies of
Flanders. Bagdad, Italy, etc., also the heav-
ing constituency of the sea. is beginning to
be recognised. Also about 6,000.000 women,
■who are prepared to admit that they are aged
over 30, point out that their new vote is
only dust and ashes if they don’t get a chance
to use it. Consequently the Second Long
Parliament will commit suicide, bar acci-
dents, and go the way of the Mad Parliament,
the. Addled Parliament, the Short Parlia-
ment, the Pensionary Parliament, the Dia-
bolical Parliament, the Drunken Parliament
and other episodes of British history.
■»
Orating at Young (N.S.W.) the other even-
ing Premier Holman spent considerable
part of the available time damning the Labor
party on account of its attitude towards the
war. Most of his unpleasant remarks
turned upon the resolution of the Perth Con-
ference and the ill-considered ballot about
war aims and recruiting, over which most of
the unions have since been squabbling. In a
general way, Holman’s critical and condem-
natory flights were fair enough. Nothing too
harsh could be said about the Perth resolu-
tions, and it would be merely playing with
words to pretend that in the attitude of
many prominent Labor men it has been pos-
sible to detect anything but a moral failure
to recognise the significance of the war to the
Australian democracy. It may or may not
be tru-e that, as Holman alleges, “the people
of Australia will never forget the action of
the Perth Conference” in relation to recruit-
ing. But whatever the measure of forgetful-
ness may turn out, to be on that point there
is certainly no reason to suppose that Aus-
tralian memory will be any more retentive
concerning the Perth resolutions than about
the shipbuilding record or price-fixing, and
numberless other trifles that Holman calls
“bagatelles.”
—O
“Trot” : The Age the other day burst with in-
dignation over the expenditure in establishing
a Post Officers’ Institute at Melbourne. A mat-
ter of £3OOO or so is involved, and I am asked
to regard this as a gross illustration of Gov-
ernment wastefulness. Well, I am not
going to. Employees in the Postal Depart-
ment are in the main a poorly-paid lot. How
the great majority of them who are married
get along is a conundrum without answer
except by themselves. Certainly their op-
portunities for relaxation and entertainment
and even for self-education must be abruptly
limited. When the employer, recognising
this, sets about giving them a chance by
providing them w r ith facilities to run a club,
he does no more than he ought to. And
when that employer is the State he does no
more than is done by P. Enterprise all over
the world. Of course there are any number
of Gadgrinds in Australia who reckon that
providing a place for an employee to wash his
hands is a concession to Socialism or some-
thing—that after the acceptor of wages
leaves the premises it matters nothing what
sort of dog-hole he goes to curl up in for
the night. Likewise there are a multitude
of parsimonious snobs who look unmoved on
a Cocked Hat being provided with a palace
and a crowd of politicians given the run of
expensively-conducted establishments, but
are horrified at the idea of more humble
workers for the State having a lunch-room
or a bath. Anyway, there are scores,
even hundreds, of ways in which public
money is got rid of with less justification
than when spent in improving the rela-
tion between the State and the lower-
paid workers in its service. To bear the
establishment of an unpretentious club for
postal officials denounced as profligacy in a
country which spends a million on an ornate
palace in London for A. Fisher, a country
which sustains 14 Houses of Parliament,
squanders barrow-loads of cash at Can-
berra, allows a game of piteh-and-toss
with millions at the Defence Department,
builds railways at a cost that staggers even
Cohen, gives -the Meat Ring a handicap,
is enoueh to make George Beeby, N. S.
Wales Minister for Absence, repent of his
intention to accept a free trip to America.
The March of the Anzac Men.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here is a greater triumph than old Rome
Saw in her shouting ways,
When from resounding arch to marble dome
Thundered a people’s praise.
From grander tasks the Anzac men come
home
While the Great Music plays.
Not on sonorous brass or beaten drum
Shall the high strain be made.
From splendid victory to peace they come,
And their grand march is played
On hearts that, grown too full for speech,
are dumb,
Knowing the price they paid.
Sons of tall Freedom, tried in battle flame
Beside the ancient sea,
They made themselves a glory and a name
That mocks Thermopylae;
By deeds far-blow r n upon the horns of fame
They made and kept us free!
Down the grey street the brown-clad warriors
go;
And as their files march by
How thick the close-pent ranks are seen to
grow—
-0 heart and misty eye!
The faces there —the faces that we know —
They live ! They could not die !
Green are the grasses on their distant, graves
Where the long shadows play
At evening from the crosses as the waves
Run in at Suvla Bay.
Not there ! Not here! Oh, sight and faith
that saves!
The dead march here to-day!
And in a triumph greater than old Rome
Knew e’er her Caesar fell,
When from resouhding arch to purple dome
The shouts were heard to swell,
Living and dead, the Anzac men come home
To all they love so well.

In the Vicinity of the Last Ditch.
The war is now at a stage when the ques-
tion of how much longer the disturbance will
continue is only another way of asking how
soon the thing will end. In view of what
has been happening to the German armies in
Flanders and France there is no valid reason
for supposing that Germany is not despe-
rately anxious for peace—that she is beaten
and knows it. And in view of the state of
collapse into which Austria is falling, and
the horrible possibilities incidental to that
calamitous country collapsing in a heap first
and leaving the northern part of the outfit
to carry on the game alone, there seems no
good ground to suspect the German of not
being ready to go a mighty long way to get
peace. Even if the yarns about the internal
condition of Germany be heavily discounted,
there is sufficient evidence in the frequent
political change and the retreat on the
Western Front to show that the country is
very near the last ditch. Austria is now the
king-pin of the situation, for though it may
be true that, the Kaiser’s armies are still
capable of putting up a big fight on the
Western frontier this can only be so pro-
vided the Austrian keeps on his feet. An
Austrian break-up would leave the German
hanging in the atmosphere, so to speak. lie
would be surrounded by nothing except
front doors, back doors and enemies raging
a* their portals. It seems, therefore, that
the policy of the Hun will be determined by
the policy of his weaker partner. Mean-
while this is a time to recollect that, if Ger-
many is permitted to make a peace that will
leave the militarist faction in a position to
re-assert its ascendancy over the Fatherland,
there will have been no victory over the
Prussian. The groan from Berlin that “Ger-
many is entitled to self-determination, with
other countries” is a mere gag. If the war
leaves the German entitled to determine
whether he is going to be an international
burglar—an armed menace to the freedom
of his neighbors—then the war might just, as
well never have commenced. The Prussian
interpretation of self-determination would
reduce the phrase to the wildest jest on
record. Apparently he thinks of it in terms
of the boot for the other chap and the loot
for himself. '
Permanent anti Reproductive Beer and
Other Enterprises.
The present Queensland Government is. un-
flinching in the matter of liquor; suggestions
about early closing find it unresponsive. And
it isn’t merely a passive liquor-resister.
When the beer excise was raised the Bris-
bane hotelkeepers put up the price of the
foaming pint and the stale flat pint in the
name of the living wage. Straightway a
beer strike was organised. In such a case
it is, of course, hard to say who is the
striker. Perhaps it was really the hotel-
keepers, seeing that they refused to pursue
their usual avocation unless they got higher
beer wages. Anyhow, the public called itself
the striker, and the point didn’t signify. There-
upon the Government, as owner of the State
railway refreshment-rooms, either scabbed on
its fellow publicans or joined in a protest
against a grasping monopoly. It undertook
to sell booze at the old figure, and straight-
way Brisbane railway station became more
of a pub than a place for the accommodation
of trains. There were even suggestions about
cutting out traffic to make room for more
bars. The Ryan Ministry says it is work-
ing the beer-pump at a profit, but if so it is
the only payable feature of the business, for
the railways as a whole are losing over
£1,000,000 a year—the biggest railway deficit
in the country’s record. The same combina-
tion also alleges that its great meat business
yielded a profit of £54,000 last year, and
talks of investing another £2,000,000 in the
affair and supplying steak and chops to
everybody within five miles of a railway. It
has other large and profitable schemes in
view—quite a number of them. But though
the public has lost none of its) faith in Public
Enterprise it has lost mfich of the old belief
in the figures of those who run it. When a
'joint-stock concern makes a loss it has to
charge it against the concern in some way or
another. It can’t simply collect it from the
shareholders and make no entry of the tran-
saction in next year’s accounts, as State
Enterprise does. Then it usually aims at
having a reserve fund, so that the interest
thereby earned may help things out in bad
years and the reserve itself will be a standby
in very bad years. But Public Enterprise, as
a general rule (there are a few honorable ex-
ceptions like the Commonwealth Bank),
makes no provision against bad years. Often
it doesn’t even provide against depreciation
and does a dirty swindle by putting down
Avorn-out assets at their value when new.
Very often it deliberately falsifies the
accounts by not charging the concern with
the full interest payable on its liabilities, and
though a company manager who showed
£20,000 profit by leaving out a liability of
£50.000 for debenture interest would run a
great chance of gaol if the deceived people
who invested on the strength of the deception
could get him there, the Political Managing
Liar isn't even ashamed and hardly ever
loses his billet over the matter. What the
community really knows about permanent
and reproductive loan enterprises is that,
however dazzling may be the alleged returns,
they don’t pay off any of the debt upon them,
and it is almost always necessary to raise
a trifle more per inhabitant in taxes to keep
them going. And the community has become
used to that and would be quite surprised
if it was otherwise.
“Scrutineer” : The queerest feature of the
half-pay Cocked Hat and full-pay Chief
Justice episode in N. S. Wales, referred to
in The Bulletin (17/10/T8) is the admis-
sion of Holman that “strong representa-
tions” had been made to Cabinet for pay-
ment to the Acting-Governor (Cullen,
C.J.) of the whole of the salaries of both
offices. There should be a clear understand-
ing of who made these representations. \\ as
it Cullen V Was it a deputation of occa-
sional feeders at Government House V Was
it the Crown? If. during the interval be-
tween the date of the half-pay allowance to
Strickland’s term expiring and the half-
pay to Davidson commencing. Cullen
reckoned he was being sweated on a £6OOO
job when the regular wage happened to be
£B5OO, the fact should be made known, so
that Cullen might stand forth as defender
of a great and vital principle. Anyway,
the time is about ripe for all the information
possible concerning what looks like deliber-
ate waste of the taxpayers’ substance being
screwed out of the place where it hides.

The Federal Executive Council which re-
cently approved of the inadequate compensa-
tion rates for loss of effects payable to
seamen of Australian vessels when employed
in that vague boundary-lined region, the war
zone, seem to have a very slight knowledge
of what seamen’s effects are. Officers and
engineers are allotted £25 each, regardless
of the fact that the deck officer’s books,
nautical instruments and binoculars would
run away with more than that sum for a
start. Even the Imperial Government,
which was always reported to be on the
close side, isn’t so buttoned-up in this
respect, as the following shows: —
Imperial Scale.

Certificated Officers . . . . . . . . £5O

The one item favorable to Australia is the
£l5 to the seamen and firemen—and it is
totally inadequate. The Imperial Govern-
ment also pays a bonus of 15 per cent, on
wages, and has a scheme in operation
whereby the widow of a merchant seaman
receives a pension equal to a third of her
late husband’s earnings, if he is killed
through enemy action.
“F.C.” : The old sneer at the German prince-
lings, lords of domains as big as a moderate-
sized sheeprun or a mallee wheat-farm, was
amusing in its way, but—well, there was once
a country with a population of 45 millions,
about as many as Great Britain holds and a
trifle more than France or Italy, which, while
calling itself democratic, calmly suffered the
affliction of one king-in-chief and 54 sub-kings,
each lord of a sovereign State, with full con-
trol over his subjects save in a few details
that were reserved for the king-in-chief. Each
of these 54 kings had his palace—it was
usually called “official residence,” his secre-
taries, retinue, ambassadors or agents abroad,
and the rest of the showy paraphernalia.
There were also 54 separate and distinct Par-
liaments, each consisting of two Houses and
comprising from 100 to 150 members. There
were, of course, 54 several and distinct pre-
miers, treasurers, attorneys-general and so
forth ; also a score of separate Hansards were
issued regularly, recording the more or less
erudite twaddle of some 7000 members, so
that the flow of language was like unto
Niagara in full flood. This country, becom-
ing involved in war, speedily piled on to its
previous public debt of over £2,000,000,000
an additional burden of nearly £3,000,000,000,
and when the interest became due and the
war pensions and other exes, had to be paid
the taxes levied were so solid that the 45
million people became exasperated and
angrily made an end of the 54 sub-kings,
their Ministries, Parliaments and manifold
extravagances. As to what actually hap-
pened next, the records are not yet avail-
able.
«
“Country Ped” : At last the Victorian
women State-school teachers are to have
their salaries raised to that of four-fifths of
the male teachers in the same class, “pro-
vided the expenditure involved does not ex-
ceed the amount of the official estimates.”
This is at the rate of £41,000 for this year,
Avhich will mean within the next five years
increased expenditure of £46,000, £55,000,
£6” 000 £65 000 and £67.000. Said Treasurer
McPherson- “The Government realises
these figures represent substantial increases,
and although pledged to economy, it feels
that the people of this State do not require
economy at the expense of common justice.”
Which is all very true and proper ; but, Avlien
the junior teachers asked for a rise on their
starvation Avages of £4O, £5O and £6O to £5O,
£65 and £BO, they were told that there were
no funds available, and Justice Higgins'S
award of £9O minimum to Federal public ser-
vants Avas no criterion. No “common juS-
tice” for the juniors! But then they have
no votes.
While Hughes is clamoring about what he
intends to do with Australian raw materials
in addition to shipping them to the other end
of the world, will Treasurer Watt, or some-
one in the know, explain exactly what the
policy of the Federal Government is in this
matter? If this raw-material business is to
be a plank in wliat Hughes calls Imperial
policy and an item on the Fuse menu, the
public ought to be told about it. Instead of
building scenery to put the ornamental lakes
on at Canberra the Commonwealth ought to
be building silos for wheat and stores for
wool and receptacles for metals; and all
hands ought to he turned on to construct
square miles of freezing as a mausoleum for
the defunct jumbuck and the uncooked egg
and the pat of butter. If we have to battle
through to greatness and hold Cohen at bay
Avith something raw, the job must be done on
a comprehensive scale. Hughes, by his
insistence on uncooked commodities, has cer-
tainly put it up to Watt to make a few
remarks. He surely cannot expect to go on
shelving the problems of Australian industry
for ever.
A. T. Boas, the only Rabbi two genera-
tions of Adelaide Jews have known, has
retired on account of ill-health. Of Dutch
birth, with English experience, he came to
Adelaide in 1870 '(at the age of 26) when
the present synagogue was built, and has
been its head till years and infirmities put
the brake on. The Rabbi’s chief recreation
is the study of Shakspeare, on which he js
an admitted authority. A singularly broad-
minded man, he has been a welcome lecturer
at churches of various creeds and at the
Y.M.C.A.
Premier Peake fell in deep when the rumor
of alleged German capitulation reached Adel-
aide last week. He seems to have accepted
it as gospel, had the Town Hall bells rung,
gave a holiday in some Government depart-
ments, and knocked off work in the Assembly
on the plea that members were too excited to
be expected to do any work —or perhaps merely
on general principles. The Supreme Court,
which had casually discussed the news and
then gone on with its toil, took a modest
pride next day in the contrast. “Things are
deflated to-day,” said Judge Gordon drily;
and Symon commented : “Well, your Honor,
this Court took a dignified view of the rumor,
and did not lose its head like another place.”
“Ex-M.L.A.’s” send-off: —
Exit John Hoolan, at Townsville (N.Q.), at 6S. He
anc’ Tom Glassey were in the Queensland Assembly
before ’93, the year when Labor first got a decent
representation in Australian polities. Glassey was
defeated at the ’93 general election. Hoolan was
elected leader by the new-fledged Labor members,
but he resigned his seat for Bourke when the session
was over to let Glassey in. Hoolan would do any-
thing for a mate or a friend, sometimes for an
acquaintance. Though always a poor man —-he was a
working miner originally on the Towers —he never
refused a street-cadger a shilling. I think Hoolan
would have committed a crime for a friend. But he
assumed and expected that any friend of his should
prove the title when assistance was invited to get
somebody out of a hole. Hoolan ran the Mundic
Miner at Georgetown for many years, and his witty,
humorous and biting pars, were much quoted by
other Queensland papers in days long past. The
Parliamentary supporters of Mcllwraith, Nelson and
Philp looked on him as a wild extremist, but
Philp, at any rate, lived to recognise Hoolan’s ability
and broad views.
Some reminders of S. Aus. early history
came to light in Adelaide recently when
Fred Johns, who had previously handed
over a piece of timber from the old ship
Buffalo, presented three articles to the Pub-
lic Service Lodge of Freemasons made from
two historic trees which have disappeared.
One of the souvenirs was made from wood
taken from the old gumtree under which
Governor Hindmarsli proclaimed South Aus.
a “province.” That vegetable disappeared
long ago, and its exact size is only guessed
at. The ancient bent gum being preserved
at Glenelg has been proved to be a false
pretender. The piece of timber from the
original tree was doing service in the roof
of a house at O’Halloran Hill, and Dr.
Angas Johnson vouched for its authenticity.
The two other souvenirs were turned from
a piece of the tree on which John McDouall
Stuart carved his initials, J.D.M.S., on
July 24, 1862, on his arrival at Chambers
Bay, Van Diemen’s Gulf, after crossing the
continent from sea to sea. Failure to trace
this tree caused many to doubt its existence,
and the explorer felt very keenly that his
word was not believed. It was not until
17 years after Stuart’s death that it was
discovered. Some years later it was de-
stroyed by tire, but a scarred branch
remained and eventually came into the
possession of Dr. Angas Johnson.
“Nomis”: The late Gus Miller, Labor
M.L.A. for Monaro (N.S.W.) for nearly 30
years, was a splinter in the thumb of Minis-
tries. He never really extended himself
until the Estimates were on, and then woe
unto any civil servant lie caught napping tin
the £lOOO a year mark. He had the mighti-
est roar in Parliament, and was held to have
been beaten in this respect only once. Teddy
Clark, of North Sydney, roared himself into
the Assembly at the ’9l elections, and the
House looked forward with plugged ears to
the inevitable contest. It came on the Dibbs
tariff. Gus praised the Bill in such dulcet
tones as Gabriel might employ. Teddy followed
him. The N. Sydney foghorn was a Free-
trader, and he commenced: “You’ve taxed
babies’ food!” in about 2-bullpower. Then
he repeated it again in 4-b.p. Cranking up
once more, he let us have it in 6-b.p. with
an off-side driver. Then his radiator got hot
and he reached for a jug of water. But
Miller’s friends had already ‘removed him
from the Chamber. “No good,” explained
Gus, “a man can’t roar when he’s supporting
a Government, but I’ll beat hint if lie swtips
me sides for a night.” Miller was born bn
the Rocks area, Sydney, G 6 years ago.
Sydney tramway men have a legitimate
grievance just now. The fixing of 10s. a
day as a minimum wage gave the conductors
an extra (id., which isn’t much. They were
below the minimum before, and now they
just climb up to it, while a lot of workers
are already ahead of it. As for the nerve-
racked driver, whose life consists in a
desperate struggle to stop before he runs
over the old woman, and yet not to stop if
there is a ghost of a chance that the old
woman will get cleat, because he has to get
from Circular Quay to the station in li
minutes, the award gives him nothing, be-
cause he Was getting 10s. already. It merely
puts him on a level with the conductor, sup-
posed to be an inferior officer. Tramway
drivers in Sydney deserve to be paid at shell-
shock rates. The streets of a big city
shouldn’t be railways; yet in the absence
of real railways—surface, tube or overhead
—those of Sydney are. The men Who hustle
tram-cars through Sydney at certain hours
are really driving the Melbourne-Adelaide-
Kalgoorlie express or the Brisbane mail;
that is to say, owing to the incompleteness
of the line they are as essential parts of the
connection as the train itself. That is one
of their aspects. Another aspect is that
they are at the same time the drivers of a
kindly, philanthropic old ambulance, Which
must have time to take a humane view of
children, dogs, drunks and invalids on an
unfenced track. It is difficult to combine the
parts at 10s. per day.
The Anglican establishment in Victoria, or
a wing of it at least, is the latest to adopt
the “ticket” system at elections. At the
recent annual Synod Low churchmen fought
out on this plan their battle with the High
section, for long firmly planted in the seats
of the mighty. The chief contest was for
representation on the Archbishopric Election
Board, which consists of six of the clergy and
six of the laity. It is alleged that Dr.
Leeper, sometime warden of Trinity, with
Murray Buntine, of the Caulfield Grammar,
called a caucus meeting whereat a “ticket”
of six laymen was chosen; while Canon
Langley, of St. Mary’s, Caulfield, circularised
electors with a list of six approved Low.
Broad or Evangelical clergy. The result was
that no clergymen but those on the ticket
were elected ; and only one off-tlie-tieket lay-
man, Merritt, M.L.C., reached a scat on the
Board. It was a great slaughter. The Dean
of Melbourne, Charles Godby (formerly vicar
of St. George’s, Malvern), had to take his
place among the ripe old placeholders’ dis-
carded ; while five canons were spiked, in-
cluding the spectacular E. S. Hughes, of
Eastern Hill. An indignant Ilighchurchman
afterwards put the case thus: “Aided by
one of the No-Popery scares so frequent
in our English history, the organised Low
Church party has been successful in sweep-
ing into obscurity those who for many years
have been guiding the destinies of the Church
of England in Melbourne.” Among the biffed
laymen was that solemn saint. L. V. Biggs,
of the Age. He lately struggled up to a
lay-canonry beside such mellow and well-
gilded churchmen as Randal Alcock and
Edward Rigby; and both of these also suf-
fered defeat in the try-out.
Dead in Adelaide, at 85, G. E. De Mole,
who was an English midshipman in the
Crimean war, and later secretary to S.A.
Marine Board and also to C. C. Kingston
during the latter’s strenuous period as
Attornev-General of S.A. One son was killed
at Gallipoli; the other is manager of the
South British Insurance Co. in Brisbane.

of a couple of episodes. Marie Eaton s Aus-

Spring is advanced enough for open-air en-

gets into an unusual line of poor clothing
to play homely comedy as a girl of Clothes-

Wirths’ Circus made its annual re-appear-
ance at the Hippodrome (Melb.) on Saturday
night. This year’s show is strong in aerial
performers, the foremost being the Zandill
Sisters, who, hanging by their teeth while
turning in mid-aii', confirm dark suspicions
about the strength of the female jaw.. The
same graceful damsels are seen again.in the
Cevine troupe, who indulge in a wire act
to the grave risk of their necks. The
Four Flying Winskills are also fond of tak-
ing the air near the roof; but the most sen-
sational performer is Montfort, who whirls
around on a trapeze as if in a hurry to meet
his undertaker. The stage behind the arena
is the scene of some impressive tableaux by
Bailey’s animal statuary, which now includes
a couple of sheep trained to the verge of
complete immobility. On the stage, also,
the Garcias give to an orthodox tumbling
act a few original twists of their own inven-
tion, and Bernasconi’s lions reveal the ex-
tent of their reluctant education behind a
large cage. The peaceful and restful family
of elephants revel in the comparative freedom
of the arena, where the inevitable souvenir
of Phil Wirth’s sagacity, Earl Dudley, and
several other horses from the brother’s
stables are trotted forth for their yearly
inspection. Hereabouts the aged clowns
appear for shrill juvenile blessings, and one
of them, Dan Yelding, is worth a lot of all-
round approval. His agile work on stilts is
extremely clever.
The late Sumner Locke is credited with
the authorship of “Mum Dawson, Boss,” at
the King's (Melb.), but the play bears no
visible resemblance to the original story, and
the main characters are merely fugitives
from the Steele Rudd menagerie with then-
old familiar habits thick upon them. Nearly
all of them have the combative loudness ot
the Rudd collection, whilst Dad and Mum
Dawson reveal the tendency to maudlin sen-
timentality that afflicted their counterparts
in “On Our Selection.” This time an old
armchair is productive of much inhuman
wretchedness. It seems to be a throne made
holy by Mum’s continuous maternity, and
the last drop of pathos is wrung from the
fact that it may be sold with the other furni-
ture when old man Dawson is faced with
ruin. Happily the menace is averted by a

it may be said that

the misdeeds of J.

tion for a widow which flames into matri-
mony before the last act. Grade Dorran is
a patch of rather obscure sweetness as Caro-
line Dawson, whilst Lilias Adeson as Mum
provides unrelieved vociferousness with
eunuch vinegar for an audit discussion at a
ladies’ patriotic-fund meeting. Leslie Woods,
as another airy crook, is pitifully inept; and
as for Willie Driscoll, if lie cannot take
something for his gruesome dipsomania the
writer will be compelled to.'take something
for Willie Driscoll.
George Willoughby is the only notable fresh
figure in “High Jinks,” which finishes a
brief revival at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) to-
night. And he is only notable on account
of a commanding waistcoat which projects
at least a couple of inches beyond the furthest
point reached by the previous heavy-weight
exponent of his part. There are one or two
other changes in the cast, but Field Fisher
continues to make frivolity contagious with
his mysterious perfume, and Connie Ldiss
is still substantial enough for the role or
Adelaide Fontaine and another character ot
equal dimensions. To-morrow night the
theatre will be closed to prepare the way for
“Hello Everybody,” headed by Jack Cannot
and Minnie Love.
“Business Before Pleasure,” at the Royal
(Melb.). is doing well, and the Chosen are
obviously flattered by a play wherein the
national acumen and humor are found equal
to the demands of an unusual vocation.
“Vanity Fair,” at the Tivoli (Melb.), is
not excessively crowded with good things, but
it has an occasional gaiety and sparkle that
heighten the effect of ordinary vaudeville
absurdities and lend an additional charm to
a song. There are gleams of originality in
nearly all the items—even in the little potted
plays and burlesques of various orchestras -
and "the individual work is generally efficient.
The longest happening on the programme is
a Bairnsfather sketch that is deeply dented
with previous use, but is still serviceable and
adaptable for such a couple as Jack Waller
and Wylie Watson. These two circulate
freely in the comic situations, and their, in-
dustry on fiddle and ’cello gives overweight
to the musical side of the show. Beside
Watson and Waller there are Ivanoff (violin)
and Dennett (piano), and two. or three
others can hammer the latter instrument
without committing a crime. Dennett still
prods at a grand piano with a soulful look
that is a certain passport to feminine hearts.

A small and cur-
ious show, with a
mind-reader named
Astras in the prin-
cipal part, is spend-
ing a few nights at
the Town Hall
(Mclb.). Astras
goes through the
old blindfolded bus-
iness of searching
people’s intellects
for inferior infor-
mation, and, gener-
ally speaking, she
is quite as imposing as other depress-
ing geniuses in the same line of mys
terv All the same, she should surrender her
top place on the programme to Silvester, a
magician, who much depends on his own in-
genuity and dexterity in the practise of
public deception. His small tricks are neat
and finished, and there is subtle ciaft m the
mechanical allusions that, give weight and
importance to the turn. The Phasing voice
of Irma Caron is a great help to the entei
iainment, and sounds fresh and strong in
her dead papa’s “Invocation to Love. A
ventriloquist who happens during the even-
ing can occasionally be heard in an in-
different colloquy with the usual dummy.
Also a couple of noisy musicians, Stewart
and Lorraine, appear and send up the gold
standard of silence 1000 per cent.
Marguerite Clark is scoring another hit in
“Rich Man, Poor Man’’ at Hoyt’s (Melb.)
this week. The film is alleged to be
superior to the original play, and there are
probably passages that are immensely bene-
fited by being converted into movie panto-
mime. Certainly the personality of the
lead is a great asset, and makes tolerable an
improbable and often mawkish production.
The Wild West is switched on after Mar-
guerite Clark, and it is the wildest variety
of that pictured region to date, with Charles
Ray burning the available ammunition. The
name of the film is “Playing the Game, and
Ray has a fluffy little heroine, Doris Lee,
to see that he duly observes the rules. Aorma
Talmadge had three days in The Secret
of the Storm Country” at the Britannia this
week. To-day Gloria Swanson is due as
the star of “You Can’t Believe Every-
thing.” done by Triangle for the discom-
fort of nervous people. At the Melba next
door Mary Pickford commenced a week in
“Hearts Adrift,” and showered a thousand
smiles on devoted worshippers. bor tne
week-end the notabilities are Mary Baland
and Frank Keenan in another Triangle story,
“The Stepping Stone.”
The season of the Chappell Ballad con-
certs was finished with a final burst
at the Auditorium (Melb.) on Satur-
day night. Stella Power was down
with ’flu’, so the Melba contralto pupil,
Dorothy Murdoch, took her place. She sang
Handel’s “Ombra mai fu” and Goetz s Meh-
sande.” Young Cecil Parkes and his violin
received a boisterous hand. Tom Mmogue,
the Irish-Australian with the dramatic: ban-
tone voice, also stirred the big. audience.
Grace Evans was a successful novice with a
soprano to air and Percy Blundell’s voice and
Hal Elvins’s piano-handling strengthened a
fine programme
“Bungawalbyn” : It is cabled that malaria
has apparently come to stay in England.
The reasons given are that owing to the great
war traffic between England and East and
West Africa, there are many more human
carriers of the disease than there are in
normal times. The Anopheles species ot
mosquito is the means by which humans are
infected, and it appears as if this species
had become more or less _ acclimatised in
England. Knowing the devitalising effect of
malaria, I am much concerned to notice it
spreading to the temperate climes, and I d
like to see Australia take precautions before
we have an epidemic. If malaria can tlnive
under the climatic conditions of the Cold
Country, how much more so is it likely to
do here?

Tweet, tweet! Rackety Coo!
And a flock of pigeons comes fluttering througn.
Cooing’s below and cooings above,
And a Russo-Turkish arrangement of love,
With a musical setting of brief despair
And a lot of delectable things to weai
The comedy ripples the Sydney air.
Never a Bolshevik bomb to burst,
And only a moderate vodka thirst
Go to the making of Muscovite bliss;
But the tuneful suggestion of cuddle and kiss
Fills the atmosphere far and wide
Through the lilting strains where the dancers glide
Around liatinka, the runaway bride.
Merry the lights and shadows that lurk
In the painted town of the unwashed Turk,
Where the harem beauties their time employ
In dainty trippings of rhythmic joy,
While truth with gentle suspicion strives
To disentangle the husbands and wives;
And the play goes on and the girl survives.
Virtue conquers the numerous sins;
Assisted by comedy true love wins;
And the songs are pleasant and all comes right
When the curtain falls on a joyous night.

A better view of how the National of M.L.
has fared during the war years is given in
this comparison :
Written off
Gross Premises and
Profits. Expenses. Investments.
1914 .. £258,024 £113,128 £15,000
1915 .. 275,239 125,476 20,000
1916 .. 296,555 153,027 20,000
1917 .. 329,268 175.623 28,000
1918 . . 360,748 211,753 20,000
The disclosed gross profits illustrate how
profitable business has been; but expeuses
have been leaping ahead—gross profits have
grown by almost 48 p.c. since 1914, while ex-
penses have shown an increase of 87 p.c.
This is chiefly due to the extra income-tax
the National is called upon to pay to both
the British and Maoriland Treasuries. In
1910 about. £lB.OOO was paid in Maoriland
and £21,750 in London—a little over twice
the amount demanded in the previous year.
For the 12 months to March 31 last the
M.L. Government collected £58,008 and
the British Government £29,053 —together
£87,061, and equal to over 111 p.c. on the
paid-up capital.
The profits in the first table are shown
after deducting amounts written off: since
1914 £50.000 has been written off premises
and £43,000 off investments. For many years
substantial amounts have been set aside in
this way; which is one method of creating
solid internal reserves. “Landed property,
premises and furniture,” representing the
London head-office and over 40 branches in
Maoriland, now stand in the books at
£158,005— only a fraction of what they are
really worth. But apart from the consider-
able "internal reserves the National lias accu-
mulated, the disclosed figures show it to be
very strong

Premises . . . . 85,756 161,938 158,005
Altogether the bank owes the public
£8,302,521, and no less than 50 p.c. is held
liquid. To meet the £4,114,527 of liabilities
not represented by liquid assets there is
£5,539,671 in advances and the £158,005 of
heavily written-down premises. As to the
advances, the directors say that they “have
watched them with special care,” “that ample
provision has been made for all possible con-
tingencies,” and that thev are satisfied that
they are “clean and liquid.” Looked at from
another point of view, the balance-sheet shows
that for every £1 of the shareholders’ funds
the bank holds less than £6 of .the public’s
money. The position is thus very sound.
One ' item among the liabilities calls
for explanation—the increase of 6§ times in
the bank’s note issue. These notes are not
convertible and were declared legal tender for
five years—until the end of 1922.
The results for the past two years must
have surprised not only the shareholders, but
also the management. Two years ago the
chairman told shareholders that, in view of
the heavy increase in expenditure, “it is evi-
dent that vou must in the near future con-
template either the payment of your divi-
dends subject to income-tax, or you must
accept a lower dividend —or possibly both.”
However, everything worked so well in the
fourth war year that the amount transferred
to reserves after paying the usual 13 p.c.
dividend was £17.796 compared with £9029
in 1916, though £5OOO more was written off
in the earlier year'. Maoriland has, of
course, been doing wonderfully well with its
products at war prices, and the big propor-
tion of the produce the Dominion has not
shipped owing to transport difficulties has
been mostly paid for by John Bull. How
much longer the abnormal prices for wool,
meat and dairy produce will be paid there is
no idea; but a slump must be expected sooner
or later after peace is declared. And by that
time Maoriland will have discovered what it
means to be the proprietor of a tremendous
war-debt.

The “machinery, plant, furniture, fittings
and vehicle reserve” is included with some
doubt. The balance-sheet is not a very talka-
tive affair, and profits are shown “net.” What
allowance has been made for depreciation
The Bulletin does not know. If full allow-
ance has been made before showing this net
profit, then the substantial £27,393 now
standing to the credit of the item may be
regarded as a genuine reserve. This eo. took
over an old-established business in 1904.
Capital was then £40,008 ; £30,000 being paid
to the vendor, half of which represented
goodwill—still shown in the balance-sheet.
The rapid progress the eo. has made is shown
in this comparison of the balance-sheet figures
over 10 .years:—
1908. 1914. 1917. 1918.

War conditions have given the co. a big lift.
Since 1914 no less than £95,000 of new
capital has been got in, and a 12$
p.c. div. has been maintained on the lot.
A point that should be noted, however, is
that the margin between the dividend and the
disclosed profits is not large, and of the in-
crease in reserves of £17,114 for the nast two
years £9317 represents additions to the
machinery and plant reserve. If this reserve
is a set-off against wear and tear then the
disclosed net profit for the past year left a
margin of onlv £5O after paying £26,006
away in dividends. Of course, it may be
that full allowance for depreciation has
been made independently of this reserve, and
there may also have been further provisions
for contingencies before showing the profit.
Undoubtedly a very fine business has been
built up, and shareholders have done very
well —particularly as the new shares have
been issued to them at par and are worth
about 295. 6d. on the market.

Some changes have taken place in this old
Australian mutual office during recent years.
For 23 years it did not look for business out-
side N.’S. Wales. Then in 1901 it crossed
to Victoria. Four years ago a branch was
established in Brisbane, and last year the
co. opened up in Adelaide. Nowadays the
management is not quite so particular as it
used to be as to the class of business it
handles. At one time the Mercantile Mutual
was noted for the very select business it
placed on its books; nowadays it apparently
reckons that some of the less profitable lines
are also worth having. Only within the
past two years have the co.’s Articles been
amended to permit marine business to be
handled, and now the management can go in
for all classes of insurance except life. A
glance at the introductory table shows that
right down to 1916 the amount of dividend
paid to shareholders in any year was pre-
cisely the same as the amount of bonus paid
to policy-holders. The co. used to divide
20 p.c. on the fire premiums equally between
policy-holders and shareholders. The rate
of dividend thus did not bear any relation
to the profits made. In 1917 the practice
was altered, and shareholders were handed
a div. calculated at 10 p.c. on their paid-up
capital. But it had been a very bad year for
insurance cos., owing to hail and I.WAV.
troubles, and record losses were incurred.
The past year has been a particularly good
one, and after paying dividends and bonuses
the amount available for reserves has been
exceeded on only one previous occasion.
This shows how the business has been
growing:—

Interest earnings last year were £8552, equal
to slightlv under 7 p.c. on the paid-up capital.
Thus to‘maintain a 12£ p.c. dividend the ■
underwriting profit is called upon for only
£7073. Capital and funds, after distributing
the dividend and bonus, amounted to £191,14 f
and sufficient to more than cover the aggre-
gate losses of the past three years. The posi-
tion is thus strong. From another point ot
view it is not quite so satisfactory; the addi-
tions to reserves have been small—only £5824
has been added in the past five years. Capi-
tal has been more than doubled in the same
time, but business has grown rapidly also.
Capital and reserves represent 116 p.c. of
the year’s net premiums, which is a good
deal below the average of most high-class
offices. For instance, another Australasian
office which has grown rapidly of late years,
and whose accounts were reviewed on this
page a week or so ago, had funds equivalent
to 183 p.c. of last year’s net premiums. As
to the disposition of the funds, 54.3 p.c. is
in freehold premises, 23.2 p.c. in deposits,
debentures and War Loan, 10.7 p.c. in mort-
gages and 11.8 p.c. in cash and sundries.
There are 503 shareholders.

This co., w'hich retails high-class house-
furnishings, etc., has been having a good time.
It is a reflex of the bogus prosperity which
the capital cities of the Commonwealth
have been enjoying. The politicians’
method of financing our share of the war
almost entirely with a p.n. has created a
feeling of prosperity that has encouraged the
average purchaser to buy nothing but the
best of everything. Of course, it couldn’t
last, and most people had quite over-
looked the fact that some time they would
have to meet their share of the hundreds of
millions of pounds it has cost Australia to
helo suppress the Hun menace. So when the
Federal Treasurer one week announced a 30
p.c. increase in the income-tax and a few
days later introduced a bill conscripting in-
come for War Loans, a lot of people got a
shock. We are only now beginning to feel
the effects of the war on our pockets. Under
these circumstances, if Beard, Watson’s can
continue during the next few years to show
a profit almost equal to 30 p.c. on the ordi-
nary capital after paying the pref. divs,, it
will be surprising.
The hole in the profits column of the table
was due to a collapse of portion of the build-
ing, which led to prolonged litigation with
the owners. This co. won the case after it
had gone to the Privy Council, and the final
adjustment of the claim was made only
during the past year. The outcome of the
dispute was the purchase of the property by
the co. This is shown in the following com-
parison of the balance-sheet figures: —
1910. 1914. 1917. 1918.
Capital .. £65,000 £ 117,066 £157,500 £157,500
Liabilities . . 38,12?. 03,963 140,203 129,83 a

etc 5,492 11,722 17,009 17,009
Cash, etc. . . 535 15,057 6,.401 5,703
Thus the whole of the capital and over
£20,000 besides is in stock —most of it, no
doubt, purchased at inflated war prices. A
lot depends on the valuation of this stock,
and whether it is protected against any
slump in prices that may occur when the war
terminates. At present it seems unlikely
that there will be any sudden drop in prices;
still there is a danger of the co. being caught
with some unsold stock purchased at war
prices if there is a slump. Probably the
increase of the contingency reserve by £6500
out of the current year’s profits is intended
to help to protect stocks. This contingency
reserve, by the way, which now stands fit
£lO,OOO, is included among the reserves in
the first table. Book debts are also heavy,
and in these uncertain times, when many
people are spending right up to the limit of
their incomes and nobody knows for certain
what is going to happen to-morrow, con-
siderable caution is necessary. The co. s
liabilities are substantial, partly because there
is apparently a considerable mortgage blister
on the freehold premises acquired two
years ago. Capital is £157,500, made up of
60,000 6 p.c. Ist cum. prefs., 52,500 7
p.c. 2nd cum. prefs. of £l, and 75,000 £1
ords. The prefs. dividends take £5175; so
while profits are anywhere near the present
level the ords. can get a nice bite. The two
15 p.c. dividends paid for each of the past
two years, as the table shows, gives them an
average of only 6 p.c. p.a. over the last five
years.

There are erratic patches in that table, arid
in 1914, after the co. had been in business
for 26 years, only a miserable £15,000 of re-
serves liad been, accumulated. Under pre-war
conditions the wheat business was a gam-
ble: having acquired the farmer’s crop profits
depended on selling in markets thousands of
miles away. Under the Government-acquisi-
tion scheme the co. is little more than an
agent working on a fixed commission and
taking practically no risks. And as this
Co-op. co. handles a substantial proportion of
the S. Aus. crop, it has lately been making
profits with ease. For the year to June,
1917, it handled 30 p.c. of the State’s wheat,
and though last year’s yield fell short of the
previous year’s record the co. handled an
increased proportion. During the past few
years the farmer has had his eyes opened as
to the possibilities of co-operation, and the
movement all over the Commonwealth is
growing rapidly. What has happened to this
co. is best shown by comparing two four-year
periods:—
1910. 1914. 1918.

The old capital was quite inadequate, and
for a long time the co. was in still-water,
while droughts and unfavorable markets
occasionally left ugly scars on the balance-
sheets, and the results altogether did not
impress Cocky. Now, after 30 years, the
Union show T s figures which are bringing in
new co-operators rapidly. Over £48.000 of
new capital has been got in since 1914—it
has been more than doubled in five years—
and after paying a dividend averaging 71
p.c. p.a., and distributing £lO,OOO in 1917
and £BOOO during the past year in bonuses, it
has almost quadrupled the amount of reserves
that had been accumulated during tlie previ-
ous 26 years.
The co.’s business is not confined to wheat,
for it is also handling cornsacks, wool and
skins, machinery, super, stock and insurance
—though in the latter it is apparently only an
agent for another insurance co. and makes
no attempt to provide cost-price insurance
for the farmer. It also runs a land agency
and is now going into the dairy-produce

When Aluminoferric is used in connection with
reservoirs its application is extremely simple. The
qakes or slabs (which measure 22in. x Tin. x 6in. and
weigh about 561 b. each) are placed on edge in a per-
forated wooden box, or other suitable cage, at the
inflow to the reservoir, and as the slabs dissolve
readily the rate of Aluminoferric applied is in-
creased or diminished in proportion to the rise or
fall of the water passing, and may be readily regu-
lated to a nicety. One pound will clarify up to
3000 gallons of most turbid waters. Particulars from

business. All departments are progressing
satisfactorily, according to the directors.
The co. now seems to have got firmly on its
feet, and with reasonable luck it should
soon be showing the South Aus. primary
producer what co-operation really can do to
save for him the profits that used to go to
the middlemen.
A novel insurance scheme has been
launched by the combined accident cos. of
Sydney. For a premium of Is. a policy for
£lOO is being issued against death by acci-
dent during the 24 hours ending midnight
on “Jack’s Day” (Nov. 1). Gross premiums
go to swell the funds to help the men of the
navy and of the mercantile marine.
The way of the Australian metal-producer
is hard. He is used to hard knocks; and has
been in somewhat the same position as Czar
Nicholas, as explained by Mr. Dooley:
“Nickless was ready for what he expected,
but lie was not ready for what he got.”
But there is just one apparently bright spot
on the horizon. The price of standard silver
has been daily quoted for some time past at
a few sixteenths under 4s. Id. per ounce, ITo-
ducers are being paid, however, at 4s. 1-Ad',
per ounce, and in their own way they think
they are doing quite well. But as producers,
in their ignorance, pay for refining that
silver, and fine silver is quoted at 4s.
4 11-l Gd., it is obvious that somebody else is
also doing very well.
“Redoubt” : It is gradually dawning upon
a muddled country that there is no buyer for
our accumulations of copper, lead, wheat,
etc., that cannot be delivered. Hughes has
so far failed to get England to contract past
the end of this year, and is now reported to
be cultivating France. But it is a very un-
fair proposition to ask any one of the xVllies
to bear Australia’s burden. We want to
keep our mines and smelters going, and if
we cannot ship our products oversea that is
chiefly Germany’s fault. Therefore Hughes
should seeMo it that our production goes on,
and be acquired by the Allies on joint
account, even if the goods are stacked here
until shipping is available. If after peace is
declared Germany wants raw materials she
can pay for them at the prices which her war
forced the Allies to pay, or perhaps a bit
more. In the peace distribution the Allies
can be trusted to see that Germany only gets
so much of our raw material as is good for
her health and ours.

Mount Hope (N.S.W.) closed down its mine
and mill last week, and pending a solution of
the fresh-water trouble will carry on leaching
operations only. Had the construction of
the spur railway been pushed more rapidly
by the Department this shut-down might
have been avoided, for fresh water could have
been railed while copper is high in price. The
effort to keep the plant going on indifferent
water pending the arrival of the railway was;
however, futile, and the co. wisely decided to
face the position without any more delay.
The bore which the co. put down half a mile
from the mine when the dams failed first
time gave any quantity of water, but the
quality has not proved good enough for
steam, even after a certain amount of soften-
ing.
From time tq time complaints are heard to
the effect that the Lawson Ministry is not giv-
ing Altona brown coal a fair run. One reason
may be that the area of 700 square miles is
privately owned, another that State mine
officials hold that Altona is not in the race
with Morwell once modern mine practices are
adopted there. The Altona people claim:
(1) That coal can be landed at the brace at
3s. 6d. per ton; (2) that the output will
be limited only by the plant provided; (3)
that with coal available eight miles from
Melbourne, at Altona, no sane man. should go
90 miles to Morwell, and (4) that to attain
an output of 1000 tons a day at Altona an
initial expenditure of only £26,000 is needed.
If all these claims be correct, then Altona
should be an easy winner. But in
view of the fact that the public is now
paying 17s. per ton for Morwell fuel, why
do not the Altona people equip their show
and get to work? There’s not the slightest
doubt that the State would take the Altona
product at 4s. 6d. or even ss. 6d. per ton.
If costs run to only 3s. 6d. the Altona people
are missing wonderful opportunities. The
Altona crowd might also explain why it was
the Amalgamated Zinc crowd were so
anxious to go to Morwell. Also why
Hoover passed by Altona? Water is likely
to be one of the troubles ahead, apart
from mining a thick seam as against open-
cutting on a much bigger seam at Morwell.
Anyhow, that capable engineer, Lindesay
Clark, is now going to have a look over both
shows.

There has been a move to get Teddy Dya-
sou to discontinue issuing his illuminating
nn nthly reports concerning the Bendigo
Amalgamated. If he is after suicide he
had better accept the advice. The only way
to justify his sticking to his five-mile block
of Central Bendigo is to prove that he is
doing his bit by keeping facts before share-
holders. What mining is suffering from all
round is the lack of news. Nowadays very
little appears concerning reports of the pro-
gress of mine work in the score of shows
into which cash flows more regularly weekly
than into Tatt.’s. In fact the “influential”
dailies have been cold-shouldering the indus-
try that made and saved Australia from the
’fifties on. Dyason had better discard the
advice, and keep things on the move at Con-
stellation. There is about 130 tons a week
of 40s. stone being sent to the mill from the
new find at 723 ft. The bulk of the quartz
ccmes from the northern workings, where
300 ft. of reef is ahead of the pick. The
same run of stone is to be tested at 509 ft. in
the Northern mine next door and in the
Virginia at 608 ft., where 40ft. of reef and
spurs have been neglected for over a decade.
Carlisle remains Dyason’s trump-card, but
the new shoot of gold in the Constellation
arrives at a good time to swell crushings.

The certainty of a further big drop in the
gold output for this year has lately caused
the Westralian Mines Department to do
some hard thinking. There are plenty of
auriferous areas in the State on which little
or no work has been done, but most of them
are either too far out to attract capital or
they are so low grade as to be unpayable
under present conditions. The. cry from
many decadent centres and the wilderness
beyond is for State batteries. Almost every
Government mill so far installed has been
run at a loss, but the present Minister has
come to the conclusion that it would be sound
economy to continue establishing them to
help the State’s gold yield, and also because
there is always the chance of something big
being discovered.
After a hearing extending over a month, an
important gold-extraction case, in which the
Moore Filter Co. of the U.S.A. claimed
damages from the Great Boulder Proprietary
and several other big Westralian mining cos.
for an alleged infringement of patent rights,
was concluded in the Perth Supreme Court
the other day. Plaintiff alleged that the
vacuum filter now used to get gold out of
slimes on most of the large-sized mines in the
State was but the Moore invention in dis-
guise, but the defendants asserted that it
was nothing of the sort. It was contended
by plaintiff that nobody had thought of the
idea embodied in the patent until it struck
Moore, and that as the result of his inven-
tion slimes were handled at a profit which
'could not be done by the use of any other
process. Judgment was but the
case threatens to go to-4he Privy Council
before finality is reached.
The Mararoa Co. (W.A.) had barely had
time to take possession of the Light of Asia
mine at Cue before the prospects of several
neighboring blocks were being boosted. Some
have been down and out for years, yet “large
reefs and promising ore bodies” ' are now
declared to be visible at every turn, and
“encouraging assays” are to 'be obtained
“almost anywhere.” Crushing records are
also being dug up, and in fact everything
possible is being done to try and get a few
flotations off in the locality. Apparently
it is a case of now or never.

The immense iron deposits at Zampi Sound,
in the nor’-west of Westralia. have been
taken away from the Queensland syndicate
which hung on to them for 10 years and
given to Jock Thomson and others. The
successful jumpers talk of exploitation on a
mammoth scale, and generating electricity
for smelting by harnessing the tide power.
A manganese mine in Timor is said to have
been acquired in conjunction with the enter-
prise, and the early production of iron and
steel is hinted.

Despite the shortage and inefficiency of
labor and increased cost of working, by re-
stricting development and selecting the ore,
Lake View and Star (W.A.) last year man-
aged to show a profit of £1895, compared
with a loss of £5755 for the previous 12
months. No provision, however, was made
for depreciation. Ore reserves are estimated
at 308,836 tons, assaying 26.665. per ton as
against 351,491 tons assaying 26.045. The
broken ore left in the stopes at the close of
the year is given as £45,063 tons, assaying
20.355.

Tyrconnel South has followed the lead
of Tyrconnel North and left Westralia
for Victoria. Both cos. had a sort of blind
stab at fortune in the vicinity of Laverton

they tackled is better suited for small parties

Campbell Shaw had been manager of the
Edna Deeps (W.A.) for five weeks when the
Board again called in Stuckey. After hand-
ing over, Shaw sent a statement to the man-
agement, denying the “lying statements
about officials of other mines doing all this
co.’s important work,” and saying that only
one outsider, the Central mine-surveyor, had
been employed. He further pointed out the
impossibility of carrying out a progressive
policy until “the necessary data tor proper
guidance had been obtained.” He had already
forwarded plans and an assay report, and
adued "tor shareholders' information" :
From these it will be seen that very high results
have been obtained in places throughout the sampling,
and wherever any doubt exists as to accuracy tue
doubtful assay sections can be checked by re-
sampling. 1 have all the tonnages and averages at
hand, but in view of the Board s expressed dissatis-
faction I have forwarded the material so that
directors can work them out for themselves.
He the policy for ensuing six months. This work
could not be laid out witn any accuracy to follow
down the actual trend of the ore until the plans and
sampling were complete. Then two winzes— : No. 1
now started and No. 2 to be located 60ft. north of
No. X winze-—will both go down in pay ore, and if
set to the true bearing of the reef can be sunk for
two or three levels deeper if necessary. Regarding
the condition and value of the reef at No. 5 level,
there is a length of ore 160 ft. from the boundary at
the north-east end, and, upon perusal of the plan,
the position is very marked, showing that the north-
end ore body has considerably straightened up and
is bearing a more northerly trend. This is very
important, and may possibly be accounted for by
some of the lines of ore in the adjoining Central lease
intercepting or functioning in or near to this level.
Viewing the ore body as opened up in this (No. 5)
level with the values obtained and the general charac-
teristics of the reef from the surface downwards,
there appears to be no doubt whatever about the
permanency of the ore and continuity of values at
depth.
lie second opening from surface to bottom
working's. A crosscut west at the 400ft.’ level,
with the intention of rising to the sur-
face as desired by the Board, would be simply a
waste of time and money. The suggested continuance
of the present main shaft on the underlay in dead
country on the south end of the ore body
would not meet the present requirements of
your valuable property and would not comply
with the Mines Act, and as each lift sunk
carries the shaft further away from the ore it would
not be economic work. The policy for cheap and
economic handling and mining lies in sinking a new
main shaft in a position (say) to cut the ore channel
at 1200 ft. or 1500 ft. in depth. This shaft need not be
crosscutted until 960 ft. in depth is reached. Then
a crosscut could be put out to meet the Nos. 1 and
2 winzes going down from the present 660 ft. level.
This, when connected up, would place the mine in a
sound position for cheap ore extraction and economic
handling. In short, a second opening must be made
if the mine is to be worked capably and economically
and allowed to show its real capacity as a gold
producer.
The suggestion of filling with residue sands is un-
sound. 1 irstly, owing to the sand passing through
a wet shaft ; and, secondly, every point where the
sand, is handled would pass through winzes, and all
are sufficiently wet to gravitate the sand into the
levels and deepest workings.
As to values, Shaw said that assay sampling
indicated that a recoverable value of 100 s.
per ton should be obtained from the backs of
the 000 ft. level.
Dalmayne Collieries (Tas.) came into the
open last week, when a bitter fight ended
in A. A. Farthing dropping off the Board.
Financing is going to be a tough job. The
15ft. seam is there all right, but the co.’s
jetty is either in the wrong place or it is too
short to give safe moorings to craft in bad
weather. The co, got under way with 19,400
£1 shares paid_up in cash. Since then it has
floated off £45,000 of debentures, and now
stands with them between the property and
£124,900 of nominal capital in £1 shares.
As only £20,000 was actually subscribed
nearly 80,000 shares represents vendors’
goods or water. Now, with no calling power
and very little in the till, a fresh shuffle must
be made. Either more debentures will have
to be raised or fresh capital will have to be
drawn from the shareholder. This will
touch up vendor and promoter alike, and
save debenture-holders from fresh calls
all round. William Orr, who is heavily in-
terested in the show, talks of getting the
Speck Government to carry a spur line from
St. Marys to the mine, but where is the
money to come from to lay rails along the
rugged coast-line between the two points?
If this is done, Orr thinks the Blythe River
iron might materialise, even though the Fed-
eral Government holds an option over it.

Despite the dry spell and the fact that a
lot of work was done in low-grade stuff out-
side the payable area, Pioneer (Tas.) made
a net profit of £44,951 last year—£sB more
than for the previous year. This result was
entirely due to record tin prices, of course.
The combined yield of the Pioneer and Argo-
naut leases was 344,409 tons tin oxide.
Costs at the Pioneer increased slightly, but
are still below sd. per cubic yard, and the
main workings gave an average yield of
0.9651 b. per cubic yard compared with an
average of 1.1791 b. per yard during the pre-
vious 12 months. Dividends paid during the
year amounted to £44,342, or ss. 6d. per
share, the same as distributed during the
previous term.

With calls ahead John Brandon is on the
flute over Kingsgate, late Yates’s, molyb-
denite. When he acquired the show, Harley
B. Wright took charge, and either results
have been low _ or progress poor. So C.
Faul, of the Mineral Separation Co., went
on to the trail. That specialist predicts that
if the co. puts £20,000 into mine and plant,
a. profit of £20,000 annually, together with a
side-issue haul of £21,000 out of the dumps,
is possible. Brandon therefore writes with
due modesty; ‘‘From this it will be seen
that given the present prices for molybdenite
and bismuth (and recent cables indicate that
prices are not likely to be materially altered
after the war) the outlook is good.”

At Charters Towers (Q.) Clark’s and
the Bonnie Dundee are still raising high-
grade stone from narrow reefs. In Septem-
ber 601 tons were crushed on the field for a
return of gold and concentrates valued at
i42G9. Some of the tributors have been
doing well, particularly those at the Stock-
lioim, as indicated by a general average re-
turn of £7 per ton of stone, not counting tail-
ings. The total return for the Towers for
the nine months of this year is £60,891, and
dividends distributed have amounted to
£15,500, though this includes liquidation
divs. In 1908 revenue for the first nine
months totalled £508,786, divs. £56,230 and
calls £45,902.

PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBE
PHOSPHATE FOR WEAK NERVES.
AN INVALUABLE REMEDY WHICH
CAN BE OBTAINED FROM CHEMISTS
AT SMALL COST.
Excessive nerve strain is probably re-
sponsible for the fact that all round us we
see men and women who have no physical
ailment or infirmity,' yet are weak, listless,
depressed and nervous. They lack energy;
have no vim. vigor or vitality, and conse-
quently cannot apply themselves with zest
to either work or recreation. Such a condi-
tion is pitiable, yet, fortunately, it is easily
remedied, for it has been found that a pro-
duct known as bitro-phosphate will restore
lost nervous energy, and make the weak and
listless strong and vigorous again. Readers
will find that high-class chemists everywhere
are able to supply this restorative bitro-
phosphate in the form of small compressed
tablets, and as sufficient tablets for two
weeks’ treatment can be obtained at small
cost, the remedy is within the easy reach of
every sufferer. Take one tablet after every
meal, and very soon you will note a marked
improvement in your condition. You will
sleep better and awaken bright and refreshed.
Sudden, unexpected sounds will no longer
alarm you. and nervous headaches will be
banished. — Advt.

Henry Dobson, member of an old Tas-
manian family, much engaged in law and
politics, who died recently, was son of John
Dobson, who arrived at Hobart Town (then
so known) in 1834, in the ship Mary, with
liis wife and their eldest son, William Lam-
bert, who became Chief Justice of Tasmania
and was knighted by Queep Victoria in per-
son at Osborne. The second son. Frank
Stanley, was born in Tasmania in 1836. He
settled in Victoria and became distinguished
socially, professionally and politically. John
Dobson, having lost his wife Jn 1837, married
again in 1839; Arthur was the firstborn by
this marriage, and he became a' pastoralist
in Maoriland, joined the Frontier Light
Horse as a volunteer in the Zulu war and
was killed at Zoblane, South Africa, in
March. 1879. The second son of this mar-
riage was Henry aforementioned, just dead
at 77. He was admitted to tfi,e Tasmanian

A. MATTER FOR SURPRISE.
“The Kaiser was displeased to notice, when passing
villages along the roads and railway crossings, the
troops fail to pay him necessary respect; and the
inhabitants did not greet him in a proper manner
by removing their headgear. The staff is ordered
that this must be seen to.” —Berlin newspaper.
HIS HELLISHNESS : “What do you mean by
not loving me?”
Passed out at Burwood (N.S.W.), Mon-
tagu John Stone-Wigg, who from 1898 to
1.908 wore the first Anglican gaiters
of Papua. Born in the Cold Country
57 years ago, he was schooled as plain YVigg
at Winchester, one of England’s toniest pub-
lic schools; but bis father fastened Stone to
the name while the son was at Oxford.
After serving his time in a London curacy
Stone-Wigg shipped to Brisbane in ISB9, and
eventually became a canon of the pro-cathe-
dral of those days. While there he
started the first Anglican sisterhood in Aus-
tralia, the Society of the Sacred Advent,
which runs schools, orphanages and hospitals
in various parts of Queensland, and is still
the only Australian sisterhood under Angli-
can rules, though some English orders have
now branches in the Commonwealth. When
a bishop was wanted for the Anglican
Mission in Papua, which Copland King, just
deceased, had started with Albert Maclaren
in the early ’nineties, it was found that there
was no money to pay wages, but as Stone-
Wigg had a private income he was persuaded
to take the billet, and for 10 years he stuck
to a heart-breaking job, spending most of
liis cash and mortgaging his life-policy to
keep the scheme intact. Things got
fairly solvent by 190 S, and as his doctor told

him that his heart, lungs and kidneys were
all worn out. Stone-Wigg doffed the gaiters
and came ,to feydn'ey. Being “high church”
he mostly felt a cold wind from Archgaiters
Wright’s direction, and the only pulpits in
which he was seen were those of the infre-
quent “high” parishes which struggle along
under episcopal disapproval. He occupied his
time mostly in looking after the Children’s
Home at Burwood, which doubled in size and
became self-supnorting under his control;
and in helping along the Church Standard,
which he assisted to found, and of which ho
was chairman of directors and, latterly,
editor. .Just before leaving Papua he married
a daughter of Brisbane wine-merchant James
Mort. She was a niece of the old-time Syd-
ney commercial magnates Henry and Thomas
Mort.
Baronet William Broun, who died at
Manly (Sydney) last week, aged 70. was
No. 10 of liis line, and succeeded his father
in 'B2. When about 20 he came to Tasmania
from Scotland, but crossed to N. S. Wales a
bit later, and was C.P. Inspector at Tam-
worth for a long time. About 12 years ago
ho left the Public Service. He owned
Coonimbia station (Cpdnamble), Colstoun
(Gunnedah). and Dalblair (Tamworth). His
eldest son. James Lionel, takes the handle
to the family name.
Patrick Galbally, caretaker of Vic. State
Parliament House, was found dead in his
bed the other morning. Years ago. when
Trenwith emerged from his bootshop to enter
Vic. Assembly, and Prendergast, Bromley
and others were practising elocution on
Yarra Bank. Paddy Galbally was spruiker,
town-crier and press-agent for the coming
Labor men, and many of them owed a politi-
cal start to Paddy’s gratuitous energy, for
he was loud of voice, shrewd and an earnest
democrat. He was 61 when he finished.
“Melb”: Re Postmaster-General Webster’s
recent poetic frenzy. A former Legislative
poet of sorts was John Whiteman, M.L.A., of
Victoria. He spoke an original versified
speech in the Assembly against McCulloch’s
Tariff: “ ’Twill tax us in eating, ’twill tax
us in drinking,” and so on. Whiteman had
been a blacksmith, and was afterwards a
vet. at Kirk’s Bazaar. He published a
volume of poems entitled “Sparks and
Sounds from an Australian Anvil.” His
second wife was Miss Cornwell, known as
Madame Midas, mining speculator, daughter
of the contractor for the Opera House. They
kept the Clarence Hotel at the corner of
Collins and Elizabeth streets.
Captain Hector Fraser, who went down
with the lately-torpedoed Japanese steamer
Hirano Maru, was 71, and first came to
Australia 50 years ago in the sailing-ship
Murray. The Mikado gave him the Star of
the Secret Mirror for his services in the
Itusso-Jap shindy and a couple of decor-
ations for his work in the present war.
T. R. Andrews, who resigns the Mel-
bourne Hospital secretariat owing to ill-
health. after nearly 20 years, followed Wil-
liams. He has seen tremendous changes. At
one time there was an extraordinary scheme,
favored by some of the aider-
men, to sell the Melbourne
Town Hall site! The new
Town Hall was to be planted
on the comparatively cheap hos-
pital site, while the hospital
moved out to salubrious north-
ern or southern regions. This
idea was easily squelched, and
the hospital stayed where it
was. Then came the building
of the present new and enor-
mous pile, the old one being
gradually obliterated. Three
men culled the principal honors:
President Grice, Secretary
Andrews, and Dr. Stawell, who
went round the world ihspecting
hospitals and collecting the
latest ideas, or as many of them
as he could catch up with.
The outstanding feature of
Bigjohn Forrest’s character was
his fidelity to his associates,
public and private. Nobody in
the many departments ruled
by the big man ever suf-
fered censure until Forrest had
sifted the accusation to the bot-
tom. Even when justified the
reprimand was officially endorsed
with a wry face. His idol was
Napoleon, mementoes of whom
occupied honored niches in his
Perth home. Once, when visit-
ing England, the itinerary in-
cluded a visit to the mansion, of
the Lowes, descendants of Hud-
son Lowe, Napoleon’s gaoler at
St. Helena. Bigjohn strenuously
objected. He would on no account, he said,
have anything to do with even, the descend-
ants of a man “who had been cruel to the
great Emperor.” However, after some per-
suasion from his wife, he made the visit.
Langdon Bonython, of Adelaide Adver-
tiser, on his 70th birthday related
that from the. time of joining the paper
at 16 he had at the back of his mind the idea
of becoming its proprietor. While a reporter he
declined offers from Melbourne Argus and
Age, and while a sub-editor he. refused the
editorship, as it might be a bar to his enter-
ing the proprietary. Jeff Stow got the post
as editor in succession to Ilarcus, Dr. Jef-
feris having, first declined it (the paper was
great on parsons as editors in its early
years), and Bonython was part-proprietor at
31. Fourteen years later, at 45, he was sole
proprietor.. The story is significant of liis
determination, but does not take into account
the luck which brought him up against vari-
ous proprietors alwavs in need of ready
money, and willing to sell any future pro-
spects for some of it: nor yet to the business
capability with which Bonython has since
built up what was merely a promising pro-
position into a big paper. He gave a warm
—and deserved —tribute to Fred Robertson
and A. 11. Young, both on the' editorial staff
for over 30 years (which means since boy-
hood in each case), and to C. R. Wilton, a
fine journalist who has been with the paper
nearly as long.
Gunner ,T. Y. L. Moore, of the Australian
Field Artillery, who died of wounds in France
at 23 years, belonged to a Miller’s Point family.
His grandfather, Henry Moore, M.L.C.,
IS6S-188S, was one of the foremost mer-
chants of his time, and first agent for the
P. and O. steamers in Sydney. His father, Cap-
tain Joseph Moore, was a notable shipmaster
and merchant in the days when whalers tied
up in the bight at Miller’s Point. His house
still stands on The Rocks. A grand-uncle
of the gunner. David Moore, was a well-
established merchant in Melbourne and was
Minister for Lands and Works in the second
Haines Ministry (1857-S).
A varied career was that of Major James
Campbell Johnson, just killed in France. He
was a son of a Supreme Court official in
Adelaide and a nephew of J. C. F. Johnson.
He somehow got to
South Africa at 17,
and saw, active ser-
vice' against the
Boers in Kitch-
ener’s “Flying
Horse.” After the
war he joined the
staff of the Bank of
Africa, and then
had some years in
London on the
Daily Mail. When
the present wa r
began he was made
an intelligence-offi-
cer, then had two
campaigns in
France with a long
spell as recruiting-
officer between. His
only brother was
killed in action a
year ago.

have ever had when Capt. Walter Gors, Aus-

after 12 months’ hard work. His good work
extended as far as Egypt, from which place
he received many letters of gratitude. A

“Bungawalbyn”: The late Bob Nieolson,
of the Ivanhoe (W.A.), had a good share of
luck during his career. After trying station
life for a short period he Was a clerk in a
Melbourne office. He went to the West in
the early rush and ran a condenser at the
old Ninety-mile (now Menzies). Bertie,
Bob’s youngest brother, was the founder of
the family’s fortunes. He got in with a
wealthy London crowd, and being appointed
their attorney in the West was in a position
to give his brothers a helping hand. Thus
Bob went to the Duke, at Broad Arrow.
When manager Hartman left the Paddington
Consols, which was in the same stable, Bob
stepped into his shoes. When Tommy Hew-
itson resigned from the Ivanhoe Bob
Nieolson took charge. He had never had
any special mining training and picked up
information as he went along. However, he
was a capable organiser, and from the jump
successfully ran the Ivanhoe, much to the
disgust of the knowing ones in Kalgoorlie,
who predicted a short reign and disaster.
There was a good scientist lost when L. W.
McNamara went out lately in France. He
took all sorts of honors at Prince Alfred’s
and the University and School of Mines in
Adelaide. Electricity was his strong line,
and he was much associated with Professor
Bragg and his brilliant son. McNamara
was one of the first to enlist, in 1914. On
Gallipoli he was stricken with enteric, and
renewed his friendship with Bragg, sen., at
London University, where they experimented
in military gas. 'He gained a Military Medal
in France before the end came.
SATAN’S RECOMPENSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Proud on his radiant throne the Devil sat,
Set round by scented lamps of various hue.
A thousand souls upon the flowery mat
Grovelled in adoration deep and due.
No cries of torture filled the heavy air;
The place was full of dry angelic smiles.
Each scalp, once singed, began to sprout newrhair ;
And Hell grew grisly green through all its miles.
The broad certificate hung duly signed
And nailed with tin-tacks to the varnished door,
A pardon for the damned who long had pined
On the hot grids above the furnace roar, '
Not flame could purge their guilt, nor whips of pain ;
Yet now was all forgiven and forgot,
Because of that foul stigma and black stain
Cast on their names when they deserved it not.
The Devil made his mighty protest good ;
And Heaven's high justicegave the great, cool boon
Because a libellous artist’s pencil rude
Set him with Wilhelm in the same, cartoon !

South Australia has decided that the
matrimonial goose shall be served with the
same sauce as the gander. That is, S.A.
Assembly has passed an amending Act making
adultery alone on the part of the husband
sufficient ground for divorce. Amendments
proposing to make cruelty (alone) or three
years’ desertion each sufficient cause for free-
ing two divergent souls were lost, the latter
motion only by one vote. Attorney-General
Harwell opposed all alterations, with the
idea that easy divorce would make Australia
like the U.S.A., where a cut for fresh part-
ners is so common as to be “a scandal.” The
one thing on which all parties were agreed is,
the absurdity of having more than one
divorce-law inside the Commonwealth. The

tion to explain why he takes back his former
opinion that the different demands made by

bourne Gaol ought to be abolished. Long
ago Bent proposed that it should be put to
other purposes. The Education Department
and Working Men’s College, hard by, have
since been agitating to get the place, and so
remove a city eyesore. The college already
has part of the premises as bicycle stables.
In'tliis section there are buried over one hun-
dred men and women who had their necks
broken on the gallows. Their initials are cut
into the blue-stone of the walls. “N.K.”

“Algy R.”: I was coming up from the
base with a party of 40
casuals, reporting to their
various units. We had
been put out on a siding
where rain had been con-
stant for weeks past, and a
young captain took charge.
As we inarched on to the
rest-camp, eight miles on,
where we were to stop the
night, darkness set in, a
steady downpour began, and
the slush on the road be-
came more slushful. I fell
to thinking how fed up 1
was and how, if a few more
reinforcements had come to
light, 1 might have had an
hour or two longer in
Blighty, and not be lumber-
ing a heavy pack about
France again so soon. My
thoughts were dismal. But
the lighthearted three-
years’ digger alongside me
began explaining in song
how roses were blooming
in Picardy, though anyone
could see they weren’t—
not by miles. The officer
at our head fell out and told
Billjim to stop his row. A
little further along the op-
timist again broke into
cheerful melody and again
the officer ordered him to
cease. Bill shifted his pack
a little, and said: “Well,
’ow about whistlin’?”
A frail Melbourne wife of a soldier, being
invited to explain in the Divorce Court to
her long-absent husband the possession of an
infant of which hd couldn’t possibly be the
father, related that she was in the city one
day buying music when a perfect stranger
asked her if she would like a musical engage-
ment, and directed her to a house in East
Melbourne, on approaching which another
perfect stranger rushed out, hurried her
inside, handed her an engagement as a plat-
form singer, and then assaulted her. She
was so overcome that, on the stranger disap-
pearing, she merely quitted the house and
went about her business. Divorce Judge
Hood considered her moving-picture scenario
for a space and then assured the lady that
it was a picturesoue tale, but he couldn’t
bring himself to believe it. Decree nisi.
“Melb” : The so-called Noble Guard of 120
in honor of the Apostolic Del-
egate Cattaneo, at St. Vincent’s
Fete in the Exhibition, was a
remarkable spectacle. I will not
say that the N.G. was a bur-
lesque on the Pope’s Own. The
boys didn’t resemble real mod-
ern soldiers, but they looked
fine in their red jackets with
gold facings, white trousers,
patent-leather leggings, and
helmefs with white plumes. The
naked swords looked sharp, too.
But why didn’t the Noble 120
put the finishing touch to their
parade by prancing along to a
recruiting depot?

“Rarawai”: Dr. Charles
Ryan, of Melbourne, caught all
sorts of artful dodgers in Egypt
when the war was young. One
youth was pipped by the doctor
dropping a 10-piastre piece on
the floor behind his poor deaf
patient as he was leaving the
room. The man who couldn’t
hear fell an easy victim. But
Ryan’s star act was played
when he visited the troopship in
Alexandria, "which was taking
convalescents to healthier
climes. After giving all hands
a soap-down Ryan invited them
on shore for a couple of hours’
exercise and produced a couple
of foqtballs. This did the trick,
and many a lad regretted the
day he chased that ball. All
who played hard were yanked
off the ship next day. Only the old foxes
who had met Ryan before grew suspicious
early in the game and retired gasping or
limping.

Australia’s Repatriation Department might
profitably take a lead from Canada. There the
returned soldiers are taken over by a Depart-
ment of Re-establishment, which arranges for
replacing them in civil occupations. Elabo-
rate preparations have been made for
equipping them as skilled craftsmen,

making allowance for the demands of each
particular industry. Training begins while
the men are still in the convalescent hospi-
tals and continues till they are fully
competent. Up to March this year 2172
had successfully come through a re-educa-
tional course, and 4000 were undergoing
training. Physical disability and previous
experience are, of course, taken into considera-
tion, and special care displayed to see that
man and job are suitable to each other. There
are 179 occupations for which disabled men
are re-educated, so all should get something
congenial. Canada considers that its obliga-
tions to the returned soldiers are not com-
pleted until they have been fully equipped
and adjusted to earn as much and to enjoy
life as much as prior to enlistment. No allied
country owes its defenders less than that.

“S. A. Rre, 2341” : Take it from me, all
mules are not the brainless things that they try
to make ’emselves out to be. The old moke that
I used to call William Morris had a steady
job carrying 6-inch shells to the —th battery
during those bad old days of the Zonnebeke-
Ypresstuntsof 1917. Hell-fire Corner was well
known, but William Morris didn’t worry till
one busy morning when a fair proportion of
Menin-road was being blown skywards with
Fritz’s 9.2 stuff. Hell-fire was getting its
share, and, just as we were passing, a piece
of H.E. shell found one of William’s funny-
bones. With head down and the bit between
his teeth he started off at a Cup gallop down
Menin-road, knocking down Military Police,
whizzing by weary Billjims just coming out
of the line, tearing past motor-lorries, gun-
limbers and tractors, jumping shell-holes and
scaring everybody. I managed to stick
WM. and guide him on to the plank
road that led to our battery, which I
reached in record time. Coming home every-
thing was “pi” until Hell-fire loomed up
again. Instantly William Morris_ remem-
bered that he had an important engagement
the other side of Ypres. Off he went again,
full tilt, and, sticking to him like a mustard-
plaster, we reached the stables. Every day
after that he bolted, so that in the end, Mili-
tary Police for miles around were looking
for my blood, to say nothing of my
name and number for committing the
serious military offence of “galloping along
main thoroughfares.” They never caught
me, and William Morris escaped them
by getting caught by a 4.2 at Kemmell. I
like to picture him mopping up acres of green
feed and oats in the paddocks of Peter.
“Chasuble”: The last London Times to
hand gives figures on Protestant church de-
cline. In the past three years the Church
of England has lost 135,500 members. The
Nonconformist Churches have lost 74,800
and Wesleyans and Baptists have suffered
even worse. Wesleyanism is said to be
dying out. The Sunday-schpol attendance
shows a decline all round of 545,000, and
the wail of the shepherd for his lost flocks
arises like the moan of the wintry wind at
dusk.

“S.S.”: The author of “De Luxe Annie”
claims that there is no such thing as coinci-
dence, that seeming extraordinary coinci-
dences are merely the workings of kindred
processes leading to the same end. I don’t
understand him, but he might explain the
peculiar case of the five-stone diamond ring
that came to light in Melbourne quite re-
cently. The five-stone diamond ring was
found by a farrier’s apprentice. He found
it in the last place in which you would
dream of seeking for diamond rings, in a
pad of clay and grass found in the frog of
the hoof of a horse he was shoeing. Natu-
rally he went straight to the papers to look
up that day’s losers of five-stone diamond
rings. There was only one party clamorous
for a lost diamond ring with five stones, and
that party, curious to relate, was the owner
of the aforesaid horse, the neddy that went
round picking up jewellery with his feet.
But that is not the queer coincidence. The
finder sought out the owner of the horse,
and presented the ring, and was rewarded
with cash and gratitude. Three days later
he received the ring back. It was not, after
all, the diamond ring the owner of the horse
had lost, it was almost exactly like it. but
the mislaid five-stone diamond ring of the
horse-owner had been recovered in the pipe
of a hartd-basin in the bathroom. Now,
whose pocket did that horse pick?

“0.L.” : The other wet morning, in Mel-
bourne, I passed a busy city corner where,
waiting forlornly in the sleety wind, the
family of a pavement newsvendor had
assembled on the “pitch” for the day’s busi-
ness. There were five of them, all girls, the
eldest about 11 or 12. Mum, the boss, was tem-
porarily absent. Emma sat on a dress-
basket with the baby, toddler Annie stood
dully by, six-year-old Gwen stared up the
street, while Mary, about nine, stared down
it. They didn’t speak, didn’t lark, didn’t
smile —just waited around in a sort of soggy,
hopeless calm. Victoria discourages child-
labor, in theory at least; and there are
several nurseries provided for the mother
who can’t look after her own children
because, she has to go to work. Also, the State
insists on its nippers going to school within
prescribed hours. Yet here were five chil-
dren facing the elements for their daily
crust, at a time -when no Australian child
should either have been assisting in a busi-
ness or enduring the perils of the weather.
Melbourne’s new Gaud Mayor should look

herself at the poor chap."
THE BOY: “ Heavens! And she weighs four-
teen stone ten."
into the permits of the city’s newsvendors
and see if he can’t put Emma and Annie,
not to speak of the baby, where they
would not be up against the battle for a
crust in the callous street traffic.

The boarding-house had long resolved
That ’twas undoubtedly a scandal
The way our flash “commercial,” Smith,
Himself unwed, disported with
The wife of honest Henry Randal.
Encouraged by the lady, Smith
About her presence ever hovered.
Her quiet spouse seemed blind, but all
Agreed there’d one day be a brawl
When he at last the truth discovered.
The lodgers waited eagerly,
Determined they should not be missing
When came the crisis. On the stair
One ev’ning Henry caught the pair
Engaged in unrestricted kissing.

“Tarago’s” survey ;
tVe finished up, pur 62 days in the line about,
three days before the rest of the battalions in the
brigade, but in case of emergency we were kept in
the fii’e-zone. We were put on salvage work on
ground that a few weeks before we had fought over,
to the right of Wallencourt Butte, on the Somme.
For five solid months Fritz had held us on this line,
then suddenly he changed his address, leaving a still-
ness behind him which was more impressive than
the roar, of thousands of guns. An indescribable pall
of desolation had settled over the countryside.
The sound of tfie human voice seemed to come
through a hole in the atmosphere, muffled and indis-
tinct. Oh this sector the opposing lines faced each
other, across a shallow valley at about 400 to 500
yards. Just behind the northern crest Fritz had
taken up his position, and, as the ground rose
towards it, the surroundings became more pounded
and blasted; till the shell-holes merged into one
another. Over the crest, in the immediate vicinity
of bis trench, even the shell-holes were blown
out of ''existence and the country resembled
nothing so much as a rough, choppy sea.
Standing in the valley between these mud billows
the view was cut off by tumbled heaps of earth 10
to 12 feet high. Here and there, for some unaccount-
able reason, there was a few yards of trench intact.
How these small sections escaped the terrible hurri-
cane of shell, while to the right and left the line
was battered out of existence and was lost in a
wilderness of mudheaps, no man can say. But there
it was, a narrow gash in the ground eight to ten
feet deep, with the inevitable dug-out opening off it.
A few drunken “corkscrew” wire standards stood in
front of it, but, save for a few inches on either
side of these standards, the wire had gone where
most things on the Somme have gone. On the
crest, just in front of the Hun line, was the remains
of what had been a house, a tumbled heap of red
dust and splinters, studded with cartridge clips and
interlaced with machine-gun belts. The only thing
recognisable was the stone doorstep, in four pieces.
Around about this section the defenders apparently
were blown to pieces. On our side of the slope
were untidy heaps of khaki*, single, in twos and
threes, in little mounds where the machine-guns had
caught the rush. They covered a strip of country

it?”
30 or 40 yards wide along the slope to the right
and left, but none nearer than 50 yards of their
objective. All our losses seemed to have been confined
to that fatal strip, half-way up the ridge. The ground
in every direction was littered with safety-pins (from
the field-dressings), overcoats, capes, puttees, steel
helmets, legs of trousers, tunics, cap comforters,
ground sheets, equipment, Testaments, papers and
letters, rifles, cartridges, Mills bombs, heaps of
empty 18-pounder shell-cases, stacks of live 18-
pounder shells, baskets of live whizz-bangs, and count-
less empty shell-cases. Just behind Fritz’s line four

dead artillery horses, still in their harness; to the
left a broken aeroplane (ours) ; a few huridrcd yards
further the remains of what had once been a com-
plete railway train, with the trucks tumbled and
splintered, the engine perforated like a paper-box
where it wasn’t torn by "shell (theirs). All this
and countless other litter of a battlefjeld—and over
all the terrible silence that appalled the soul.

Brisbane struggled along without a sewer-
age system long after other big Australian
cities, and even medium ones like Perth, had
wearied of the casual old ways. In the
official record for 1916 it was stated that
the work was at last in hand, and the heaps
and holes in the streets lent corroboration.
Now it is seriously suggested that the
drainage scheme may have to be hung up
pending developments before it has really
begun to drain. Wages have gone up as a
matter of course. War-prices made that
unavoidable everywhere. Also interest on the
inevitable loan has gone up. At the same
time public credit has gone down; and.
worst of all, it is alleged that the amount of
work done per man on the day-labor system
has lately diminished by one-third. In other
words, where there was formerly a smell
there may be a smell and a debt.
* * * *
A well-known Melbourne south subur-
ban family gave an evening to cele-
brate the return of the major portion of
their son and heir a few days back. There
was dancing, likewise eating, and other popu-
lar pastimes. The front gardens were gor-
geously illuminated, and ice-cream and con-
genial refreshments were spattered about the
arcadian out-fittings for the convenience of
guests. A brace of the latter, exhausted by
a protracted two-step, wandered out of
bounds, and discovering at the rear of the
premises a seeming settee in a cool, dark
nook of the all-round-the-house verandah,
plumped down simultaneously, with a gusty
sigh of gratitude to Providence. The moan
of a distracted fellow creature in its agony
brought them to their feet again with one
shrill scream and one unpremeditated
word. The fact is that the settee was
not a settee. The pair had drifted into
the out-door dormitory of the host’s feeble
grandmother, and the host’s feeble grand-
mother was asleep. The condition of the
host’s old grandmother is a proof that at no
time of life can one rely upon being safe in
one’s bed in these large cities. But the chief
trouble arises from the fact that the young
married man who sat on somebody’s grand-
mother did so in company and co-operation
with the wrong wife. Things haven’t
straightened out yet.
Humor goes about in England with a state-
ment in her mouth that, after the females
actually on hand have been disposed of, the
granting of women's passages from England
to Australia may stop until two years after
the war. So there is a great rush this way of
Billjim’s new English wife. A contributor who
travelled with a large quantify of the lady
views her with depression. The new-comer has
a general idea that Australia is a land where
the waters of Pactolus are used to put out
fires, and the tramcar to Ophir or El Dorado
starts every 10 minutes. She seems to think
that nigger servants abound, and that white
women don’t work. Wherefore the attitude
of the large quantity of
lady was that she had
always been accus-
tomed to be waited
upon, and that when she
had to shift for herself
a little in the compara-
tive luxury of the
second saloon she was
a dazed creature strug-
gling with unwonted
hardships. When in-
vited to fold up her ser-
viette after the first
meal she expressed
astonishment in a high,
thin voice. She. had
never done such a thing
and didn’t even know
how to do it. Presum-
ably in her father’s
marble halls she had
dropped the garment
anywhere, and it was
removed by the cham-
berlain. When Gladys
had accomplished the
deed she was filled with
self-admiration, and, in
a high, thin voice, called
the ' attention of her
companions to the fact
that she had really done
it. Very few of the
crowd spoke directly
about their ancestral
halls, but in a general
way they implied that ancestral halls were
their customary diet instead of thistles. The
habit of being “genteel” isn’t obsolete. These
women had it. They tolerated the food. They
pnt up with the accommodation. And they
looked with forbearance on the women who
didn’t talk in high, thin voices and who took
life as it came, just like folk who had wal-
lowed in second saloon all their days.

A big firm of dealers in Melbourne
had bought the winding plant of the Ace
of Spades, at Flapjack, and left it for
some time in the small engine-house carefully
bolted and barred against possible
marauders. But the Ace of Spades was
located in sparsely settled country in an in-
hospitable district that offered small welcome
to wayfarers, and it was not considered a
likely thing that any nomad would walk off
with a big engine. However, when two
representatives of the metropolitan firm
arrived at Flapjack to commence dismantling
operations, they found, to their intense sur-
prise, that the engine stood in the open,
exposed to the 77 rains of Heaven
and all the winds that blow from that
locality. Some person or persons un-
known had not merely stolen the engine-
house holus-bolus, but had got away
with about, two-thirds of the brass fittings.
There were indications of recent depreda-
tions, and the engineers lay low, and eventu-
ally came silently upon Billboy at his work
of spoliation. Billboy it was who had pocketed
the engine-house. With it he had built him-
self a home on his own land, a quarter of ft
mile off. He was now busy removing the
last of the bearings. Billboy was not aware
of the fact that his job was being over-
looked till one of the spies coughed dryly.
Then he twisted up one eye, took a turn with
the wrench and cocked up the other eye. For
just a moment Billboy was nonplussed, and
then he said : “I reckon this engine will be
spoiled if someone don’t get her in out of the
weather.” After that the firm was not sur-
prised on recovering half a ton of brasses
from Billboy’s house to hear that Billboy.
whom they had magnanimously spared, was

“M.” : During one recent period in the line
Fritz made things very unpleasant for the
ration-carriers, wiping out party after party.
This yarn was tried on me while we were
waiting for our rations that didn’t arrive.
A front-line post had been cut off for two
days by almost incessant fire. As usual, not
all the men had brought iron rations, so the
i.r’s were pooled and split up amongst the
crowd. We had been reduced to the despe-
rate expedient of drinking shell-hole water,
and were suffering badly. At last one of
the squad, a religious man, decided to pray;
he had hardly ceased before Fritz’s desultory
fire became The party got down as
low as possible in the trench to dodge the
flying pieces of shell that came whizzing over
the top and struck the upper sides now and
then. There were cries of “Look out!” as
what seemed to be extra heavy pieces came
lobbing right in. But —they were not
shell fragments at all, but tins of bully
beef; and they were followed by a perfect
cloud of bacon, broken bread, biscuits,
etc. It transpired, afterwards, that
one of the carriers, bringing up the dry

rations in the usual sand-bag, had been killed
not far away; and a shell, having landed on
the remote side of the sand-bag, had scat-
tered its contents into and about the trench.

Or toss a tress of gold ?
Would they simper girl-shy

Adamax Saves in First Cost, Freight,
and in Cost of Upkeep.
If Adamax Roofing did not live un to the claims we make for it the contract for the supply of
Adamax to the N. S. Wales Railways for 1917-1918 would not again, after careful analysis, have
been secured for 1918-1919. Neither would Adamax have proved itself, under critical examina-
tion and tests by experts, worthy of being used in the following “big jobs”:
431 miles of Adamax Roof Covering is being used on
wool=storage sheds erected in Wentworth Park, Sydney, by
Messrs. Stuart Bros, for the Central Wool Committee.
Again, recently, 13 miles of Adamax Roofing were ordered
by the Imperial Authorities in Perth for the West Australian
Wool Stores.
22,000 sq. yds. for use on the Commonwealth Buildings at Molongo, Canberra.
20,000 sq. yds. on the Leeton Canning Factories.
13,200 sq. yds. for W.A. Govt. Freezing Works at Wyndham.
An order for 44,000 sq. yds. (25 miles) was placed for use on the South
Australian Wheat Board Buildings.
These are the proofs we give you of Adamax Superiority—not mere wordy talk that might be
applied to any other composition roofing.
Follow the lead of the master minds who were responsible for the placing of the above huge orders,
and order Adamax for roofing your factories, mine buildings, garages, sheds and homes.
Adamax costs One-tHird the price
of Galvaraised-iron.
Get that fact embedded in your mind. Take note of the saving in freight—nearly two-thirds less
than on iron.
And Adamax, unlike iron, is not damaged by the elements —Rain, Wind, Heat, Cold, Sea Air,
Mining Gases or Chemical Fumes, Rot or Rust do not wreak their vengeance on it. iheretore,
Adamax will not pinhole or dry out and become valueless —because it contains no tar or fish-oil.
Pure mineral hydrocarbon is thoroughly impregnated into the long-fibred felt, which is tnen
finished by a process which makes it impervious to the elements. .f

POLITICAL
POINTS
N. S. Wales Assembly, in the course of
the censure debate, held high argument—at
least John Storey held thin argument—to
the effect that the U.S. isn’t the right place
for Minister Beeby to go to for six months
at the public expense. Storey held that it
is a place where the worker is in a back-
ward condition, and industrial arrangements
are awful. He held that Beeby would
learn the wrong sort of thing there. The
A BITE TO A FINISH .
“On Sunday Mr. Hughes lunched at the British
Embassy at Paris, and dined with the French Minis-
ter of Marine in the evening. Mr. Hughes lunched
on Monday with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.”
more reasonable view is that Beeby won’t
learn anything coherent, just like Nielsen,
and that he wouldn’t know what to do wdth
it if he did. A brilliant aboriginal may go
to Rome and study church architecture, but
he wouldn’t know what to do wdth that,
either, and he would be better employed at
home studying ’possums. If Beeby hasn’t
any feasible ideas about how to remedy the
famine in five-roomed houses, a prolonged
study of Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of
Liberty won’t help him. N. S. Wales, with
less than 2,000,000 people, has 12 Ministers
now, largely employed in laying the founda-
tion-stones of infrequent cottages and
opening backblocks schools (one to the
square 1000 miles) and showing bush visi-
tors around Daceyville. So there are plenty
of small local reforms to attend to. This
sending of a very ordinary politician to
globe-trot a republic the size of Australia
and with 106,000,000 people, and bring back
its institutions whirling in his head, is in-
congruous. It is akin to sending the Mayor
of Boggabri to the Pyramids to get
Pharaoh’s idea for a new ash-barrel.
From a whirlwind of cables about Bill
Adams: —
On Sunday Mr. Hughes lunched at the British Em-
bassy at Paris, and dined with the French Minister
of Marine in the evening. Mr. Hughes lunched on
Monday with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He
saw M. Clemeneeau and the leading politicians. Dur-
ing the consultations Mr. Hughes made clear Aus-
tralia’s views regarding the peace terms.
What was meant, presumably, was the “piece”
terms, for Australia has not yet even con-
sidered its position as regards peace, and
certainly the Commonwealth hasn’t in-
structed Bill Adams to pose for another
Waterloo.
A general election in Maoriland? Not if
Massey and Ward can dodger it. At a
by-election for Wellington Central the
other day a Labor man emerged with a
clear majority over three others, polling
nearly 6 to 1 against the candidate pushed
by the Stick-to-Office combine. This seat
was previously held by Fletcher, a mild
Liberal, and before that by one Fisher, a
member of the first Massey Cabinet, who
faded away to London when Fletcher took
his scalp. At the recent by-election a con-
spicuous feature of the proceedings was the
fienzied backing given by Ministerial bar-
rackers to a sectarian-bigot who rushed into
the fray to split the Labor vote and exaspe-
rate the yellow poodles. He got well walloped.
“Copy Boy”: Acting Prime Minister Watt
attended the annual conference of the
Women’s National League to defend the
Government’s price-fixing policy and to ex-
plain that the Cabinet could not reasonably
have refused to adopt the recommendations
of the Inter-State Commission. When he
had finished, four leading delegates grate-
. fully informed Watt that if they had known
that the Inter-State Commission had recom-
mended' price-fixing they would not have been
hostile to the idea. Having thus made their
position plain, the delegates proceeded to dis-
cuss the urgent need of attending to the
political education of women outside the
League, who, one speaker asserted, “are
ignorant of many matters which should be
known to all who possess the franchise.”
There’s a little humor left in the world yet.
Only two understandable reasons for send-
ing H. Y. Braddon to America as Aus-
tralian Trade Commissioner for a few months
(wages £6O a week and £4O for entertain-
ment purposes) were given. One was that
Braddon’s presence over yonder was neces-
sary to expedite the building of the ships
ordered by Australia; the other, that he
would put the office system on a sound basis.
Since then it transpires that of the 12 vessels
in question 10 were in the w r ater before Brad-
don could transpire. The other two were
expected to leave the slips before he had
time to extricate himself from his
baggage. This ought to allow Brad-
don plenty of time for getting the ink and
letter-paper and statistics into position, and
as the guzzle-and-gorge habit has gone quite
out of fashion in U.S. since the problem of
feeding the army came to be taken seriously,
he can depend on not being excessively dis-
tracted. Taken all round, Braddon’s big job
seems to have started in the happiest possible
way, and everything ought to be quickly in
order for someone to tumble into a nice warm
place. Meanwhile the question of whether the
allowance for entertainment will be con-
tinued at 200 dollars a week or deduced to 25
cents for chewing-gum deserves serious con-
sideration.
F. S. Wallis, of S.A. Leg. Council, has had
the unusual experience of being the only
member on his side on a division. The ques-
tion was whether newspaper reporters should
be admitted to Cemetery Select Committee
meetings. Wallis is not usually a stubborn
man, but he was so strong on the negative
side —on the ground that witnesses are more
reserved in giving evidence when reporters
are present—that he divided the Council, only
to find everyone else against him. When he
had counted himself up and reported the
number thereof to the Speaker it was fairly
obvious even to Wallis that he had been
defeated.
Price (son of the late Premier Tom)
asked the Government in the S.A. Assembly
the other day whether it was intended to
do anything in the shipbuilding line, and he
drew' special attention to the big efforts
made by Japan in constructing bottoms.
Butler, Govt. Treasurer, replied that he
did not see any connection between what
Japan was doing and the action of the Aus-
tralian Government in this matter. Never-
theless he was glad to hear that ships were
being built rapidly in Japan, because the
more ships there were the better w’ould be
the chance of getting Australian produce
away. What w’ould Australia do without
these long-sighted politicians? Probably it
would have to set about the job of thinking
out these problems for itself.
“Paddy Star”: In Bulletin, 10/10/’lB
the Brisbane woman correspondent, writing
of an incident in the Queensland Assembly
says: “We’re not all what the political em-
broilers would have you believe." Quite
true. In X. S. Wales I have found many
who believe that the Queensland Govern-
ment is composed of irreconcilable disloyal-
ists. Well, Coyne (Minister for Lands),
Lennon (Minister for Agriculture), llux-
ham (Home Secretary) and Jones (Leader
in the Leg. Council) have each two sons
fighting overseas—and not with our enemies.
That’s a pretty fair record for one State
Government.
Naturally enough the Argus helped to
welcome the French Mission to Melbourne
with a dissertation on Australia’s duty towards
our Ally in the matter of international trade.
Briefly,' the Argus idea is that, because
our Allies had played so noble a part in the
defence of the world’s freedom, Australia
should continue to build up their industries
with raw material, while the local in-
habitant at home sticks to his simple
WASTED ENERGY.
WILSON : “ Well , it looks as if he was getting
them disciplined a bit. but I guess this
performance is staged for my especial
benefit.”
task of tearing the wool off the sheep's
back and grubbing metals out of the soil.
Already, owing to French foresight and
Australia’s lack thereof, France is miles
ahead of this country in the re-education
and repatriation of her soldiers. Dis-
charged French fighting-men have thusfar
made millions of pounds worth of nationally-
useful articles in factories newly built for
the purpose. But our own repatriated men
are as yet mostly heard of as holding down
the same old humble jobs—working an
“orchard,” keeping a little lolly-shop or
hen-run in the suburbs, or occupied in the
great, new r , national industry of making
wooden horses on wdieels for children. Cer-
tainly it isn’t all that sort of thing. At the
Agricultural Show in Melbourne, the other
week, there was a working exhibit of cloth-
making by soldiers. The authorities thought
so little of it that it was placed in a dark
and dismal tent; and, for one citizen who
went to see the wheels go round within, a
hundred preferred to go and look admiringly
with its hands in its pockets at the raw
material growing on exhibits elsewhere in
the- grounds. The same lack of public inter-
est handicaps hundreds of other young in-
dustries. Australia must be just to her own
soldiers; and her populace may surely still
wave its hat and give three loud cheers for
the Allies with perfect good faith while
holding to such an aim.
“ Jacko”: There’ll have to be a solid effort
at reconstruction in the education system of
N S. Wales after peace is made. The loss
to the community in inefficient and generally
unskilled youths who are thrown on the mar-
ket each year can be gauged only when one
is inside the system. I know the seeondary
schools, and am now engaged in technicai-
teaching business. The national waste I see
appals me. As things now stand, the pur-
pose of our secondary system, tacitly, if not
explicitly, is to shove th 6 kid along the
thorny path that pulls up at the University
or thereabouts. The defence generally put
up is that a “character education” is neces-
sary, and that early specialisation is an irre-
trievable evil. It may be on paper. Anyway,
the current system isn’t likely to help sup-
ply that demand for efficiency which alone
is likely to pull us through our present
bog. Taking the High Schools first, it is
recorded that of the 699 boys who left
last year only 140 continued their education;
and of that 140 only one is put down as hav-
ing directly attended a technical college. All
the others—including 125 who closed down at
the age of 14 without completing the first
year’s course—were scattered, to scratch for
their living. During the same 12 months
5262 youngsters left the Primary Schools,
and of these only 1300 indicated a continu-
ance of their education elsewhere. Of the
total. 1050 took on jobs as shop-assistants,
warehouse-assistants, clerks, and the rest:
256 others became factory-hands. 224 of
them coming from the Sydney district. Out
of the 817 who are put down as having
.entered unskilled jobs, 720 left school before
reaching 14. What is wanted is a Ydoser
relationship between the general and techni-
cal sides of the system.
P. Fraser, who won another seat for
Labor in Maoriland Reps, at a recent by-
election. emigrated from Scotland in 1910
and soon became very busy in industrial
agitations. For a time he was organising
secretary of the Social Democratic party,
and in the waterside strike of 19i3 he was
not amongst those who concealed their
illumination under a bushel. He is a water-
side worker himself, though lately he has
been occupying the editor’s chair of the
M.L. Worker.
Hogan, M.L.A., who is doing what probing
there is in the in-
quiry into the man-
agement of Victoria’s
Consumptive Sana-
torium at Green
Vale, handed a neat
one to Board of
Health Chairman
Robertson, who had
been trying to make
ends meet by selling
milk, butter, etc..
from the Sanatorium
farm. “Don’t you
know,” said Hogan,
“that under secs. 22
and 2.” of the Dairy
.Supervisions Act
you are prohibited
from selling milk
from an institution
housing infectious
cases’?” Of course
Robertson “wasn’t
aware of it.” The
things Victoria’s
Health Board isn’t
aware of and can’t
do when it is aware of them won id almost fill
a session’s Hansard.
After long opposing the Vic. Farmers’
Union as a political force, the Argus has
suddenly climbed right down, taken it all
back and accepted the concern as a proper
vehicle for the expression of rural opinion in
Parliament. Farmers are entitled to self-
protection, Gran’ma at last realises, and
rural-producers have therefore actually been
advised to join up with the union as the best
means of seeing that the various branches do
the right thing. The V.F.U. has shown con-
siderable discretion so far in avoiding
embroilment with sectarian and other side-
tracking leagues, brushing the red-herrings
out of its onward path with great energy
gnd singleness of purpose; and this new and
surprising affability of the Argus will hardly
cause ' anything but a wink between
members. As for any possibility of ffooding
the union with Tory farmers, the fact is that
the V.F.U. membership—confined to actual
rural-producers—is already so large that it
would be hard for any body of newcomers to
influence its immediate aims. The Union
did quite well enough at the last State elec-
tions to make it fairly well satisfied with its
existing platform.
The Victorian Upper House has been
struggling hard in its aged fashion with a
Closer Settlement Bill. Which, of course,
means a Closer to Melbourne Settlement
Bill, bat the aged stragglers don’t put it
that way.

“The President is therefore no longer at liberty to
accept a mere autonomy of these peoples as a basis
of peace, but is obliged to insist that they and not
he shall be the judges of what actUr on the part of
the Austro-Hungarian Government will satisfy their
aspirations and their conception of their rights and
destiny as members of the family of nations.”
— U.S. reply to Austria.
It was enough for yesterday that these
Should gain the first, slow step towards liberty,
Feel on their foreheads the high-moving breeze
Full of the breath of world-democracy.
The tyrant’s name might stay, shorn of its power;
But that demand died with the passing hour.
Since then the guns have spoken in the name
Of those who scorn the Hapsburg and his ways.
A thousand agonies, amid the flame,
Have freemen suffered that the growing days
Might shake the fetters from the last pale slave
And give his manhood room to heal and save.
Yesterday you were strong and granted nought:
To-day you tremble at fair Freedom’s voice.
You kept the field, against man’s hope you fought
Yours was the hour to choose and yours the choice.
Now learn that on Democracy’s proud way
To-dav is not the same as yesterday.
Swiftly the changes run. The kings are dead,
Killed by the power that they themselves had made.
Their march was over fields of battle red,
Death was the music that their trumpets played;
Now, in their waning strength, they rise to cope
With the last foe of might—the hangman’s rope.
No terms with these! Peace, hardly won, must stay ;
And peace dwells not where emperors take the sun.
Clear up the gilded wrecks! We dare not play
At parley, with man’s foe upon the run.
Hurl down the yesterdays! To-day we stand
Victorious, with Freedom in command.

The Pessimist .
The pessimist sat down beside his bed
And to his wife, in weary tones, he said- •
“/ feel so bad—oh, wretched fate perverse —
That even doctors couldht make me worse!"
She strove to lead his thoughts to better times
By reading one of Dr. Morses rhymes.
It told how stiff'rers just as great as he
By simple pills were freed from misery.
He listened with an air of gloomy doubt
While she, with womans forethought, turned about
And, with the dainty bottle brought to view,
Persuaded him to take a pill or two.
Since then his life has changed. A brighter world,
Like star-bespangled banner, has unfurled
Before his eyes; and, pessimist no more,
He feels the joys he never felt before.
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WC'RM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE SPECIFIC I r OR
THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN CHILDREN
AND ADULTS.
The general symptoms of worms are a
tendency to pick the nose and a sensation of
itching in the anus. Other symptoms. are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or. disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep and grind-
ing the teeth, sudden starting out of sleep as
if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children, and symptoms resembling
water in the head have been ascribed to
worms and have ceased on their expulsion.
The long round or stomach worm is the
commonest kind of worm from which man-
kind suffers, and is of a light, transparent
color, resembling the ordinary ground worm
except that the extremities are more sharply
pointed than the ground worm. Young
people are more subject to these worms than
middle-aged or elderly people. They live
in the bowels, and sometimes make their
way into the stomach and throat, causing
sickness, vomiting and choking. Generally
one or two would be the most a person
would be afflicted with, but sometimes a
much larger number is met with. The length
varies from four to eight inches, but young
ones an inch to two inches long are also found.
Threadworms or pinworms are of very
common occurrence in children. They are
very small, from one-sixth of an inch to half
an inch in length, and resemble cotton thread
—they are sometimes called seat worms, and
reside in the lower bowels. The chief symp-
tom of this worm is severe local itching, rest-
lessness and irritability, and a frequent de-
sir.e to urinate, picking at the nose; loss of
appetite and anaemia are also observed. To
get rid of the worms and their eggs their
nests also must be removed, and that re-
quires a specific remedy.
For both stomach and thread worms Com-
stock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, taken
according to directions, on an empty
stomach, followed by a dose of opening medi-
cine, will succeed where others fail. Com-
stock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, are

STOP STOMACH DRUGGING.
NEUTRALISE THE DANGEROUS ACID
WITH A LITTLE MAGNESIA.
Stomach drugging is dangerous. Drugs
often deaden the nerves and render them in-
sensible to pain; but pain serves a good pur-
pose—it is Nature’s method of indicating
that something is interfering with the smooth
working of the human organism. When the
fault is corrected the pain will cease. Pain
after eating—heartburn, flatulence, etc. —
usually indicates not that the stomach is dis-
eased, but that it is troubled by excessive
acidity. The acid irritates and inflames the
delicate lining of the stomach and so causes
pain. Obviously it is of prime importance
that the cause of this pain should be re-
moved, and to accomplish this you should
obtain some bisurated magnesia from your
chemist and take half a teaspoonful in a
little water immediately after meals. This
is the remedy which produced such excellent
results in the case of Miss Alice M. Allen.
69 Fletcher-street. Auburn, Victoria, who
says : “I suffered so severely from indigestion
that I often had to lie down, quite exhausted
by the pain. I became thin and felt worn
out. Nothing seemed to do me the least
good until I tried bisurated magnesia, but
the first dose of this made me feel better,
and I have had no return of my complaint.”
Equally good results are invariably aceorn-
plisbed by bisurated magnesia, because it
neutralises the harmful acid, which is the un-
derlying cause of all the trouble, and, having-
done this, it soothes, heals and strengthens
the stomach and ensures proper digestion of
the food.-—AmT.

‘Te Whare”: The latest birds and ani-
mals’ protection (N.S.W.) Act, though imperfect in
some respects, is a distinct betterment of its crude
and ineffective predecessors, it should be welcomed
by every clean sport and bird-lover, as well as by the
man on the land, who owes to our insectivorous birds
a debt he can never repay. All native birds and
animals (except sucli as are blacklisted) are now
protected from killing, capture, injury or disturbance,
and thus the destructive proclivities of gun-hog and
pea-rifle fiend can no longer be safely exercised. Such
birds and animals as are not considered worthy of
protection or are injurious to crops, pastures, etc.,
are for the first time sensibly grouped in a list.
These include, so far, all the shag or cormorant fra-
ternity (voracious devourers of mullet, trout and
other valuable fish fry), the leatlierheads or friar-
birds, soldier-birds, white and “rose-crested” cocka-
NO CONSIDERATION.

carry back the bread in.”
toos, lory ( i.e., crimson parrot or red lory—not the
still more gorgeous king - lory or king parrot), rosella,
Blue Mountain parrot, red-rumped grass parrakeet,
wedge-tailed eagle, all bvands of snipe, gill-bird,
white-throated falcon, silver-eye, raven and crow.
Strangely enough, the rose-breasted cockatoo, or
“galah” of commerce, is labelled “rose-crested cocka-
too,” and must henceforth be so designated in legal
proceedings in which this fowl is concerned. This
bird, as a matter of fact, wears a pale pinkish-white
topknot over a vest of deep rose color, and isn’t
named from its cerebral adornment. The hazel-eved
crow is set down mainly as a berry-, insect- and
carrion-eater, like his rare relative the small-billed
crow; yet he appears in the black list. It is the
almost (except at very close quarters) undistinguish-
able Australian raven which picks the eyes out of
young lambs, and for hix sins the crow is to suffer.
The inclusion of the gill-bird, a honey and insect-
eater, is somewhat unaccountable, nor is the white-
fronted falcon (or “duck-hawk”) any more destruc-
tive (to small birds) than the sparrow-hawk and
certain others of the tribe to which protection is
accorded. Introduced birds which may be slain at
any time are limited to the sparrow and starling.
The latter (although credited with bot-fly destruc-
tion) is a pest in orchards, fills spouting and other
convenient nooks in houses with its large and lousy
incubrror, and pre-empts the rights of many native
birds which breed in tree-hollows. Native animals
wiLiout the pale are the dingo (warrigal), flying-
frx, tiger and native-cat, kangaroo-rats, bare nail-
railed, white-throated, red-legged and black-striped
wallabies, padymelon, wombat and the bandicoot
persuasion. To these add the introduced hare and
fox and our old friend the rabbit. A maximum
penalty of £2O attaches to the killing, etc., of any
bird or animal not blacklisted ; if cyanide of potas-
sium or other poison is used for their destruction
the offender may be divorced from £5O. The “scien-
tific” person, unfortunately, may still be authorised
to “collect” certain protected birds and animals.
At least, collections made by authorised individuals,
otherwise than for the purposes of museums or other
public institutions, should eventually become the
property of the nation. All members of the police
force are rangers under the Act ; but honorary
rangers with similar powers and duties may be
appointed. Persons refusing to give their true name

“Camelero’ : I’ve suffered from scrub-itch
in Bananaland, but it’s a mild ailment compared to
the itch contracted by many of the men in the Camel
Corps in Egypt and Palestine. I’ve known men to
scratch themselves, until their
bodies were covered with blood.
A few days later the itch would
turn into small septic sores,
and if the blood of the afflicted
happened to be out of order, as
was generally the case with lads
who patrolled for days in the
desert on a diet of bully and
biscuits, the sores took months
to heal. I’ve known only
those who worked amongst
camels to suffer from the com-
plaint. I was with a mob of
transport camels that was used
for conveying water to the boys
close to the Tripoli border dur-
ing the Senussi campaign.
There was not a particle of
green food available for us, and
the camels lived on tibbin and
dhurra (Egyptian maize) for
months, with the result that
hundreds of them were covered
with horrible running sores. I
was one of a party that had to
drive these beasts down the coast
to where they could get green
feed. Before the trip was
finished we were all suffering
from the hideous complaint, and
had to go into hospital at Cairo.
It was only in the wide, dry
spaces of the Libyan and Sinai
deserts that the boosters de-
veloped the disease. They were
not troubled with it when they reached the grass-
covered country in Palestine.
“Liu”: Between my place and the nearest
pub—a six-mile stretch—is a large area of Crown
lands, reserved, I believe, as a mining lease. The
grazing rights are leased, but the area is not fenced,
and a holder of a mining-right can erect his humpy
thereon and remain in undisturbed possession. Whilst
passing one of these homes recently I noticed two
drovers shepherding a large flock of sheep. The
jumbucks gradually surrounded the house like a sea.
Out popped a hard-featured woman and swept the
horizon with her eye until it alighted on one of the
drovers drowsing in the sun. “Why don’t you bring
’em inside?” she screamed. Quite unruffled he
drawled: “Is there any gra-ass there?”
DA YBREAK PHILOSOPHY.
BROWN ( counting the cost of the jag) : “ How true the remark of the man who said,
'Where there’s a swill there's a pay.’”
“Gleniris”: A device which will keep all
but blind bunnies out of vegetable gardens is the
installation of toy windmills made of some light
wood which will whirl in a slight breeze and stuck
in the ground at fairly brief intervals around the
green stuff. Hie mills should be about nine inches
from wing-tip to wing-tip, and each wing must be
garnished with a hit of shiny tin, or the like, to
catch the starlight. Brer Rabbit gives just one
wild, frightened glance at the contraption and then
tears back again into the tall timber. What about
calm nights ? Oh, well, there’s a flaw in most sys-
tems.
“Wnudi” : The shingle roof for houses and
sheds has been forced back into fashion in the coastal
belt, which tends to remove one of the stupidities
of the past. The magnificent stringybarks, black-
butts, gums, ironbarks and woollybutts that should
be available were widely destroyed. Most of the
destruction was compelled by enactments of Parlia-
ment, which required selectors to ringbark their
forest land and burn off scrub. Even to-day ringbark-
ing is assessed as an “improvement.” , A sane Govern-
ment (if we could import one) would gaol any
person who destroyed valuable timber. I know
farmers on the Clarence and thereabouts who have
to buy firewood and pay a big price for it, yet when
they built a few years ago they had hardly house
room for standing trees. Those trunks to-day would
be a fortune as milling timber. There are still
good belts remaining on the rivers, but they are
being cleared away with the same cheerful indiffer-
ence to future needs. And while forests that took
hundreds of years to grow are being destroyed, there
are a few gangs of men scattered about planting
little patches of trees under the much-talked-of re-
afforestation scheme. We learn backways.
“Melaleuca” : If “D.F.” considers that the
forester or “boomer” kangaroo of Tasmania is as
extinct as tlie Tas. emu be is “up a wattle.” The
emu has long since vanished from the surface of the
Speck, but not so the forester. It has become well-
nigh extinct, but not quite, and living specimens can
still be obtained. A mob of these ’roos is carefully
guarded on the Camerons’ property for instance.
In former days the forester ’roo was a
familiar figure on the Tasmanian gumscape,
and the abos. of Captain Cook’s era failed to
decrease their numbers. In the early days of
European settlement, however, tucker became scarce,
and parties of convicts were let loose to go ’roo
hunting in order to save the “camp,” as Hobart
was then known, from undue inroads on its tucker
scale. This materially reduced the forester popula-
tion, and the progress of settlement and the arrival
of the breech-loader have nearly settled the species.
“Barcoo”: At Harry Hart’s Springfield
station on the Barcoo River (C.Q.) a spring of
first-class drinking water rises to the sur-
face from a depth of 6000-odd feet below. This, is the
deepest-flowing artesian well in Australia, if not in
the world. The water gushes a good foot over the
top of the bore-head casing, and gives a flow of
250,000 gallons daily. The temperature of tlie
water at the point of issue is 198 degrees.
* * * *
“Lantana”: Bridget Connolly, a lone
bachelor woman of 87, died recently on the Lower
Clarence (N.S.W.). She was one of the first settlers
on Shark Creek, having, in the very early days,
selected a considerable holding, on which she worked
like a man. She was possessed of extraordinary
physique and courage. In her younger years she
often took her produce to the little town of Rocky
Mouth (as Maclean was then called), in a wheel-
barrow, returning home the same day with her
household necessaries. No short trip, that, either.
*■***•
“Half-uv on”: The European captain of
a bSche-de-mer lugger working north of Cooktowu
was fishing in a dinghy, when a big “king” Was
hooked. After some trouble it was got into the boat
but managed, during the process, to secure a bulldog-
grip on tlie captain’s leg. The bite was worth 10
stitches later. Haven’t heard of the kingfish doing-
tile cannibal act before.
FORGOTTEN IN THE RUSH.
DIGGER: “Is this what y' call the theatre
of war?”
LIEUTENANT : “Part of it, anyway.”
DIGGER: “Pity we didn't bring a fire-escape!”
“Syracuse” : I reached the Shearers’ Arms
before tlie interest in the new star, Nova Aquilse,
burned out. Had a chip with the oldest inhabitant,
and asked him if he had seen the star. “Yairs,” he
said; “but only in a distance.”

FROM INFORMATION RECEIVED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of Wonga, on the Gippsland track,
Was William Down a native,
And never lived a man Outback
More uncommunicative.
In answer to all questions Bill
Wrote on his census paper: “Nil.”
Nobody ever knew if Down
A Tory was or ■ Labor;
Nor did he mention, when in town,
The death of Grant, his neighbor.
(They found poor Grant, near black with flies,
A fortnight after his demise!)
When Joseph Lvne to Down repaired
To ask how he had treated
His horse for gripes, Down merely stared
At him ; but Lyne repeated
The question with an int’rest keen,
Till Down informed him “kerosene.”
To William, when he met him, Joe
A dismal tale related.
“I tried some kerosene, you know,
On that there ’orse,” he stated,
“But, ’strutli, it died!” Down looked at Lyne
And answered briefly: “So did mine!”

“Papua”: Re “Binbashi’s” account (B.
13/6/’18) of the (German) New Guinea knot’s charm
to captivate the winsome brown lasses. The custom
is prevalent through practically all Melanesia. Love-
philtres and charms are a part of the regular business
of every brown or black sorcerer, and .ho contrives to
extort quite a lot of native wealth from the credulity
of his less intelligent brethren. An old medicine-man
pal of mine reckons there is nothing in the; same
street with an alligator’s tooth filled with cinnamon
and green ginger when you want to charm Mary.
Brown coating from the inside shell of a cocoanut
and a piece of the amorous young gentleman’s wool
if placed inside a cigarette and smoked by the adored
female is another unfailing enticer of the maid.
Usually, so far as the average brown sister of the
coast is concerned, there is no enticing bait needed.
The beach lady is on a par with the average house
cat, so far as morals are concerned.
“M.” : Some (birds have what Dr. Alfred
Russell Wallace terms warning colors, or conspicuous
markings, discernible only during flight. When one
so marked becomes aware of the presence of an
enemy, instead of uttering a cry of alarm, it flies off
unfurling the danger-signal. The other birds take the
hint and skidoo. Among the silent alarm-raisers are
the dollar-bird (white circular patch under wings),
the tree-creepers (buff band across wings), common
myna (white on wings and tip of tail), Indian turtle-
dove (tail-tip white), welcome swallow (band of
white on tail), drongo (white spots under wings),
wood-swallow (band of white on tail and similar
marks on edge of wings), the bell-magpies—several
varieties (white on wings and tip of tail).

“T. 0.1. ”: While on circuit once, the hotel
at which the late Alfred Stephen, Chief Justice of
N. S. Wales, stayed was full of bushmen. Of course
they were not rabid teetotallers, and the talk and clatter
throughout the night was so great that the Judge
arose from .his bed and presented himself in his night
clothes to the crowd in the bar parlor. Amongst
them was the local police-sergeant. Stephen glared
at the officer, and ordered him to clear the premises.
“Your Honor,” blandly said the sergeant, “the only
man in Australia who can give me that order and
have it carried out is the landlord”—who, by the
way, did not' give the order. Stephen was candid
enough to mention this from the Bench, admitting
that the John Hop knew the licensing law better
than the C.J.
* * *
Simon the II.”: I’ve been reading an
article on the heavyweight British tanks and their
eaith-levelling, barb-wire and concrete-smashing
powers, and I wondered what was going to be done
with all the ironmongery after the war. I would like
to make a bid for some of those tanks, if they are
for sale, and get busy on the prickly-pear with them.
As pear- and scrub-land reclaimers they should be
absolutely it. A couple of heavies as squadron-leaders
of a fleet of whippets with rake attachments on their
tails going through some of the near lands out west
and up north would be a cheering sight.
“Geob.”: One of the beauties of the salt-
bush country in northern S.A. is the company flights
of that lovely, rose-breasted cockatoo, the galah.
They evidently do not share that inherent fear of
man which is characteristic of most fliers, and it
is no uncommon thing for a bushman to ride in
amongst a settled flock without scaring them to
flight. At sundown they come in hundreds, some-
times thousands, to the waterholes for a drink.
When all have had their fill they appear to rise
simultaneously, and with unmelodious screeching make
for home. There is such unanimity in leaving that
a starting signal must-be given, but as far as I
know it’s unknown to man.
* * * *
“Half-moon”: While vagabonding about
the Torres Strait Archipelago I met an old Danish
diver who showed me some mementoes of the various
sunken wrecks he had worked at; Amongst the
collection was a bright golden curl. “See that ?” he
said. “It cost me a gruesome experience. Down
at the wreck of a passenger ship on the Bananaland
coast I went along one of the alleyways and opened
a cabin door. In the cabin was the body of a
woman with a little girl’s body clasped in her ar ns.
What prompted me to cut this curl from the civ Id’s
head, I don’t know; but, as I moved back the w ty I
had come, the bodies caught in the swirl, foil jwed
me until I was able to close a door behind me. I’ve
seen a good deal, but that fairly blew me oi.t for
the day.”
DIFFICULT, ANYWAY YOU LOOK AT IT,
BOSS: “When d'ye think them pigs'll he fit to kill, Mick?”
MICK: “I dunno. The way they’re goin’, he the time they’re hig enough they’ll he too
old.”
“Billy Bong”; Here’s my substitute bush
■menu. Iguana (which is just as good as most of the
flathead they serve under fancy names in the city
caffis) ; iguana and pigeon stew (entrSe) ; bandicoot
(guaranteed far more tender than any alleged
chicken) ; porcupine (which was invented by the gods
because they knew that in the future Australia’s
population would consist mostly of Jews).
Pick your own dessert,, but don’t choose a
padymelon wine—take gall for preference. Have
seen a dog run slobbering saliva for an hour
after he has made a snap at one of those tempting
green globes. P.S.—lf you have any dinkum abos.
handy throw in a few snakes, but don’t try to cook
them yourself.

“Byrimine”: Two miners in Wolfram
(N.Q.) were firing in a 60ft. shaft recently. The
ladderway stopped 20ft. from the bottom and the
men were raised and lowered in a bucket by a whip
horse. This day five holes were charged. One fuse
refused to light. The other four were lighted and
, the signal to pull up was givqn. Then things hap-
pened. The bucket fouled half-way up, and the
two ■ ■ inhabitants of the vehicle grabbed the
timber. The bucket swung clear again, and one
frantic miner clambered back into it. As he did
so the whip horse slacked and let bucket and cargo go
wallop to the bottom. The man who had scrambled
to the ladderway got to the surface. The one who
had been dropped pulled the fuses of two charges,
but failed to stifle the others. He crouched in the
shaft while the charge exploded. After the excitement
he was brought up without any serious injury. He
has the winning ticket in Tatt.’s sweep on the
Melbourne Cup.
* * * *
A storekeeper at Finniss (S.A.) was driv-
ing down hill in a lonely spot recently when the
axle of the van broke and in the consequent upset
he was pinned underneath. There he lay from 8.30
in the evening till after 6 next morning before he
was found. When asked how the long night passed,
he replied: “Put in most of the time talking to the
horses, to keep them from moving on.”
* * * *
“G. Arden Hill”: There is not much
ceremony about getting a start on a casual job now-
adays. We were digging a trench for a water-pipe
line the other day when a burly, whiskered stranger,
with a forearm like a ham, strode up to the boss.
“Are you the joint ’ere?” he asked, abruptly. “I’m
the ganger,” was the reply. “Well; what about a
crimson mouthful of it, anyway?” jerking his thumb
towards the excavations. “You can eat the whole
magenta lot of it, if you like,” said the boss.
“You’ll find a pick and shovel along thdre some-
where —bog in.”
“Eddyson” : Clune was the man who drove
me out from Waterwells to the coal-mine, and
during my stay there he fathered me. On the third
day he passed me an open letter: “Your wife is
now stayin’ at this place with the feller she ran
away with. Sined A Frend.” Within a Glune
received three, other letters “Sined A Frend.” The
last one ran: “Your wife and him are thinkin’ of
leavin’. Come at once, and you’ll nab ’em.” “Who
is writing these, do you think ?” I asked. “Bob
Alsop, a course,” Clune replied. “And who is he?”
“He’s the feller she ran off with,” said Clune.
“Oh!” said I. On the following Monday morning
a small nervous-looking man, with his hat in his
hand, came skulking along the verandah to where
Clune sat on the rail telling me how rabbits
could be effectually exterminated with a sluicing
hose and a heavy pressure. “It's Alsop,” said
Clune. “He’s come back.” Alsop approached ner-
vously, screwing his hat in his hands. “Mornin’,
Willie,” he said; “how are yeh?” Clune eyed the
man with marked coldness. Alsop writhed. “Come
to tell yer, Willie,” he faltered, “there ain’t no one
sorrier nor what lam for xvhat’s ’appened. The
missus is over at Morwell.” “And what of that?”
“I was thinkin’ you’d maybe take her back.” “Well,
I won’t, and that’s flat.” ‘‘But you’ll have to,
'Willie,” wailed Alsop. “You’ll just have to.” “And
for why, if you please?” “Because I’m goin’ to
gaol,” cried Alsop triumphantly, “and someone’s got
to look after her. You bein’ her rightful husband
it’s yore juty. I’m goin’ to gaol.” “Better stay out
of gaol and look after her yourself, seein’ you was
so good as to cart her away.” “I won’t, Willie
Clune; I’m goin’ to gaol. She got me to marry
her, and that’s bigamy. I’ll get five years for
that. I’m goin’ to gaol right away. You orter have
pity on a pore bloke what’s goin’ to gaol. They’ll
give me five years all right.” “Oh, no, they won’t.”
“I bet they will. There ain’t no ’ope for me. It was
delibrit bigamy.” “Oh, you’re ail right, Alsop
You can go back to the missus. I was never married
to the late Mrs. Clune.” “Not married to her?'
Alsop’s face expressed wonder and consternation.
“Not married to Annie?” “No, never.” “Then she
■—-she ain’t yore wife?” “She ain’t mine, and she is
yours.” Alsop staggered, and slid against the front
of the pub. “In that case I can’t even go to gaol,”
he whispered. “No, I don’t suppose you can, Bob
Alsop, unless you’ve done somethin’ wrong.” Alsop
did not hear him —white-lipped, wild-eyed, he was
staring calamity in the face and whispering: “Then
I can’t go to gaol—-I can’t go to gaol!” He pulled
himself up, and staggered away. Clune looked after
him with a touch of pity. “That’s the sort of
woman Annie is,” he said.
* * * *
“Melos”: The female quail, more bulky
than the male, determines the conditions of the
marriage contract. Presumably because her gar-
ments are finer than those of her spouse, she is too
flighty to condescend to engage in domestic duties,
beyond giving the henpecked old man a short spell
in the early stages of incubation. Hubby is thus left
to complete the task ;• and subsequently to feed and
educate the youngsters. Meantime the Mrs. has
levanted with another mate. Heaven knows how
many dupes are taken in by the abandoned female.
* * * *
“Walla”: “Oscar” (B. 5/9/T8) is right:
Australia’s most beautiful, trailing flower is Sturt’s
desert pea. But he is wrong when he says that it
will not transplant. I have transplanted dozens
of them successfully and discovered that plants
which were neglected after their transition seemed
to fare better than those which received regular
waterings, manure and mulching, etc. Too much
water kills' them. They flourish in a dry, sandy soil.
The boys of Broken Hill spend Saturday searching
for young plants, which are sold readily at 6d.
each to the gardeners on the Barrier. A useful
trellis for this trailing plant is easily improvised by
placing a piece of wire-netting on the ground. The
blooms then show up to a _ better advantage and do
not become covered with particles of earth ■ washed
up by water from the hose.
* * * *
“N. or M.” : Nietta, a little place in N.W.
Tasmania, is going to puzzle etymologists presently.
It was surveyed and named by R. \V. Stoldll, who
called it after his .sister Henrietta ; but the name in
full being too cumbrous for general use# the con-
traction was adopted. Moore-Robinson, in his care-,
fully-compiled book of Tasmanian nomenclature, is in
error with regard to Jericho, Jerusalem and the
Jordan River, which he supposes to have been named
by one of the Imperial regiments that had been 1
previously stationed in Palestine. The real god-
father of these stupidly-named places was one Morris,
a person who carried a Bible through the early roads,
of Tasmanian history.

“W.” : Saw the blacks on Melville Island
(N.T.) bringing a dugong ashore, off Cape Gambier,
where for many years Binghi has had a big camp.
They pulled out in their huge dugouts—a 35-footer
was the best sample, we struck—and got fast with a
good barbed spear and line. When the dugong was
dead, overboard went the nigs, swamped the dugout and
juggled it under the floating sea-pig. A big conch
shell was then used to bail out the cargo of water
and up the canoe lifted the half-ton of dead meat.

“Copabella” : Mrs. Dawkins had been
clamoring for years for Dawkins to add an outside
kitchen to the homestead. Dawkins at last had to
do something, so he decided to bring up from the
voolshed out-station an old hut no longer needed
there. We grinned when we got the order, for that
old shanty was so lively that even the swaggies
passed. if. by and camped under the creek bank.
, jacked the structure on to a bullock-
waggon, and had nearly reached the station with it
when we saw a fury on a grey horse pounding down
e track to meet us. It, was Mrs. Dawkins, purple
with rage and hard riding. We sat about while she
flayed Dawkins, and then leapt to obey his order to
sling the damn thing off and bring in a load of
wood!” There happened to be a 20-foot antbed at
the spot, so we dropped the haunted hut bottom-
down on the bed, and went our way/ A few weeks
later it was remarked that the ants had evacuated
their bed, and a further examination showed that the
hut-vermin had gone, too. We experimented with a
couple of notorious stretchers and a mattress on
another ant-home, and again the little strangers
left the furniture. That hut is now at the Dawkins
homestead, innocent of company as an operating-
theatre. Any Abo. ever hear of the ant-cure for
bug-infested articles? The ant was the ordinary
bush ant with the red rear-end.
THE NIGHT-HAUL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With a smoky flare in the darkness
That reddened the sands, sea-wet,
And ruddied their sun-tanned faces,
The fishermen drew their net.
Afar, on the outer coastline,
They hearkened the breakers’ roar;
Hand over hand in the midnight
They hurried the net to shore.
Behind them were limb and leafage,
That tossed in the dark, and strove;
And, sheltered from wind and turmoil,
Before them darkened the cove.
Knee-deep in the ooze and sea-drift
They toiled, while the township snored,
For a loaf of bread in the cupboard
And a pot of beer on the board.
Their boat, on the waters nodding,
Stood forth in the ruddy glow;
The fish, in the darkness firing,
Went arrowing to and fro.
The lines, weed-tressed in the red light,
Came in with the flowing tide,
And, coil on coil on the sea-beach,
Lay wet at the fisherman’s side.
Keen eyes through the darkness peering,
Tense hands on the meshes set,
Red-lit in the starless midnight
The fishermpn watched their net.
Then one to the other shouted,
And joy in,their veins took fire;
For the sea of its boundless plenty
Had given them their desire.
For the sea of its great abundance
Had granted their lowly wish,
And sent them, to stay their hunger,
A largesse of leaping fish.
Then, lighting their pipes, they rested,
With eyes on the silver hoard,
And thought of a loaf in the cupboard
And a pot of beer on the board.

HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS
= CURE =
IS THE FINEST REMEDY IN THE WORLD FOR
COUGHS, CROUP AND COLDS.
THOSE who have had occasion to take Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure are
astonished at its Wonderful Healing Power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Pain or Soreness in the
Chest, Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Stuffiness,
Asthma, experience delightful and rapid relief. This
medicine is particularly valuable to those who are sub-
ject to Colds on the Chest, as it Strengthens the Lungs,
and renders them less susceptible. It is most comfort-
ing in allaying Irritation in the Throat, and giving
Strength to the Voice, and for this reason is thoroughly
appreciated by Clergymen, Public Speakers and
Singers. It does not allow a Cough to become
Chronic, and in this respect is absolutely indis-
pensable in preventing a cold from developing
into Bronchitis, Asthma, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,
or Consumption. No house should be with-
out a bottle of this Wonderful Remedy, as
taken at the first indication of a Cold, a
dose or two is generally sufficient. A
Cold should always be “nipped in the
bud.” or serious illness may follow.

released from other duties by the armistice,
crossed the border to uphold the cause or
liberty there might have been a great deal of
mixed liberty, and the Hapsburg tamuy
might have finished in a pine coffin, the same
being taken at a canter in a cheap funeral.
It was a blessed breathing-time, and the
elections kept people employed. Constitu-
encies were hastily marked out on the map.
For lack of time there were no electoral rolls,
but every male who looked reasonably sober
was allowed to vote. The Provisional Govern-
ment said it badly wanted to have the entire
vote taken on one day, but the elections were
spread over 24 days, so as to allow the soldiers
to get off by relays. One result of these
rough-and-ready methods was that the organ-
ised voters who got in early all voted, while
many disorganized ones, when the poll closed
at six, were just where they had been on
revolution day—raving on the far horizon.
Another result was the existence of a mov-
able majority, which went from place to
place and voted steadily. All parties pursued
this swindle, but generally the organised
travellers had secured nine-tenths of the train
space and the disorganised ones could hardly
even get a cab for love or money. If Tues-
day’s electorate had always been next door to
Monday’s electorate the disorganised would
have walked, but it was never less than 50
miles away. In any case, the disorganized
soon ran short of railway fares, which had
been increased 100 per cent, to furnish funds
for war widows and war orphans, and the
boots of the disorganised gave out.
The Department of Discontent had at least
three candidates running in every electorate
—a Constitutional Monarchist, a stern but
orderly Republican, and an Anarchist or
upheaver or terrorist to catch the votes of
the irreconcilables and to enable the police to
get a list of them. A Junker of the old type
was added in places where he needn’t fear
being absolutely egged to death, so that a list
of the reliable supporters of the old order
might be secured. None of these Junkers
were elected lest their success might make a
bad impression on the Allies. The result was
a working 'Republican majority with suffici-
ent organised Constitutional Monarchists and
Anarchists to make an Opposition. Not a
single unorganised candidate got in. In fact
they might have been beaten on a fair and
square vote, for the organised Republican
always looked a little more like Cato or
Brutus than the one who ran on his own, and
where a loose Anarchist went to the poll the
Government Anarchist was so much looser
that the loose Anarchist seemed tight by com-
parison. The ballot was absolutely secret,
and after the vote had been counted and
verified the ballot-papers, or some papers
that looked like them, were burned.
The book ends here. Subsequent volumes
will deal with the inner history of the Free
Hun Parliament’s proceedings. (Proofs of
Vol. I. received, or likely to be, from the
Prophetic and Apochryphal Press, London.)
The Magic Pudding
There is a long summer’s clay of Austra-
lian sunshine between the covers of “The
Magic Pudding,” written and illustrated by
Norman Lindsay, and published by Angus
and Robertson, of Sydney, at 21s. —a stiff
price for a desirable book primarily in-
tended for youngsters. The author starts
off with a delicious idea—a pudding named
Albert that has legs and arms as well as a
hoarse voice with which to insult people of
small appetite who don’t eat enough of him.
Immediately after a meal Albert is all there
again, and, wearing his bowl as a hat, is
ready to take anyone’s hand and tramp on
another stage with bushman Bill Barnacle,
Sam Sawnoff, the penguin, and Bunyip Blue-
gum, the author’s famous native bear —all
life members of the Noble Society ot
Puddin’-Owners. The mild villains of the story
are the ’Possum and the Wombat, profes-
sional puddin’-snat.chers. Their job is made
easy by the fact that the puddin’-owners are
fine simple blokes, and Albert, the Magic
Puddin’, is willing to follow or be owned by
anybody who will keep on eating heroic
quantities of him. Otherwise he is a loyal
member of the travelling band, and pipes
up gruffly when it is his .turn to sing. Every-
body sings and fights and eats magic, puddin’
with tremendous zest, and the story ends
cheerfully up a tree on which the Noble
Puddin’-Owners have built a little house with
a flagstaff for the Australian ensign and a
little puddin’ paddock for the puddin’ to
play in. It is hardly necessary to say that
the spirited illustrations and letterpress
blend perfectly. Many of the northern
European fairy tales and fantasies on which
we were brought up are grim and sinister;
this gay and characteristically sunny Aus-
tralian book only goes as far as humorous
assault and battery, and has no shadows at,
all.
A Satchel of Books
Nationality and Government, by Alfred E. Zim-
mevn, is a sound, honest book of platitudes with a
few things that are rather less platitudinous than
the rest. It deals with a multitude of social and
political questions, and defines many things that we
knew before but seldom took the trouble to define.
For instance, a man might know he had two legs,
but the orderly mind of this writer proves it so
clearly that he knows why he knows it. That is, of
course, assuming that he hadn’t lost one leg. (Chatto
and Windus, London, publishers.)
Dreams, Simply-Wove of Youth, by Jack Eliot
.(Kingston Press, Sydney). There is no appearance of
vouth in these verses, for all the author’s claim.
Some writers are born very old. A glimmer here and
there is the most the reader can expect in the gloom
of 78 pages of indifferent rhyme.
Counter-Attack and Other Poems, by Siegfried
Sassoon (Heinemann, London). War verses written
by a man with some skill in verse-making, but desti-
tute of poetic feeling. It is the darker side of the
European horror that is kept to the fore, and the
realism is convincing without being impressive.
Sample:—•
“We start the damned attack; and, Lord knows why,
Zero’s at nine; how bloody if I’m done in
Under the freedom of the morning sky.”
Business, Robbery, etc.
Sharebroker William Ward, of Melbourne,
has just completed the direct distribution
of 408 bags of potatoes, grown by re-
turned soldiers in the Romsey district;
also, he has collected the money for them.
The net return averaged the satisfactory rate
of £4 15s. a ton. This little movement fol-
lowed a loud wail raised by a soldier-settler,
who complained that his returns through city
agents scarcely covered his working expenses.
The benevolent scheme of private selling did
not involve‘the payment of “charity” rates
for the spuds. It merely meant the producer
selling direct to the consumer. The success
of the plan suggests that, very soon, the
Government must seriously consider the
question of establishing a produce-agency on
behalf of the small farmer. But it must be
the right sort of agency and not loaded down
with a large, expensive staff.
“Boree”: “L.” suggests (B. 3/10/TS)
that I had not inquired very far into
N. S. Wales Minister for Lands Ashford’s
scheme for saving calves. Well, I know that
“L.’s” assertion, “that when a cocky declines
to poddy a calf it is because it wouldn’t live,
anyhow,” is sheer drivel. The South Coast
and most other millt-cockies won’t rear calves
and because of that Ashford’s scheme should
be encouraged. It has been proved good by the
Raymond Terrace Dairy Co., which was
working it before the Minister decided to
make it a State scheme. If “L.” gets busy
himself inquiring, he would learn that the
Raymond Terrace people were making such
a success of the idea that they displayed'no
hilarious joy at the State stepping in. More-
over, more than one cocky has done
the same thing in, a small way, and made
good profits. One of the biggest cow cookies
on the far South Coast has decided to adopt
Ashford’s scheme on his farm, not being in
the vicinity of one of the proposed depots,
although he used to knock his poddies on the
head unless they were from a special cow.
Lastly, “L.” is wrong again when he says
that Ashford entrusted the experiment to a
“fruit and wheat” expert, instead of to an
officer of the dairy branch. The officer in
charge was an ex-llawkesbury Agricultural
College dux, and was running a dairy-farm
before he took a job with the Government.
“Charlie Sausage”: A quiet young man
recently called and solicited a job from my
friend Maclndiaink, who runs a commercial
art foundry. There was enough work about
for an extra hand, but Mac wanted evidence
of the visitor’s ability. “Here,” he said,
pushing him pencil and paper, “draw some-
thing on that —something unusual.” In a
few masterly strokes the young man pro-
duced an excellent drawing of an elephant.
It was a really good elephant, and Mac sat
up in his chair and took him on piece-work
there and then. The young genius was set
up with a table and chair and proceeded to
engage in mortal combat with a mound of
pickle and suit ads. After a day or so he
emerged and exhibited the results for Mac’s
approval. The mark of the elephant was
over them all. His horses were elephants
disguised, and one could discern trunks
intertwined all through his border designs.
Pickle-bottles suggested elephants’ feet, and
even his suit designs were filled with beings
whose Christian names one felt to be Jumbo.
Altogether it was evident that the elephant
was the young man’s repertoire. As Mac
said, “It. was a good elephant, but one can
have too much of a good elephant. I took
the artist’s address in case someone starts a
circus or a patent cure for elephantiasis.”
“W.”: “Anti-Bunny” (B. 5/9/TS) misses
the point of my remarks re rabbit-skin
requisitioning. No reflections Avere intended
against the cockies. They are a useful and
often ornamental class. The point is, _ why
should the trappers’ product be requisitioned
at half its market price, even for our boys
ac the Front, when other articles for that
destination are not so treated? If beef,
leather, avool and everything else required
by the soldiers are to be requisitioned at
half market rates, then it’s all right. Jus-
tice is done ; hardly a squeal would arise from
the rabbiter; but Avhen only a small and
uninfluential class is reached for, it looks
unworthy of such a fearless and irreproach-
able body as the National Government. As
to trappers doing little good, the anxiety of
squatters and cockies in many parts to get
them on to their ground doesn’t suppoi't “Anti-
Bunny.” No one expects trappers or
poisoners to kill the pest right out, the rea-
son being that the price of the carcase or
skins sets a limit below which a man cannot
make a decent wage, and he gets out when it
comes to that. If the Government had fixed
the price of rabbit-skins at 10s., say, a ter-
rible death-rate would have ensued among
the cottontails. Anyway when you have a
pest that you can’t altogether destroy, con-
verting a large part of it into cash is a lot
better than leaving it alone.

“0.L.” : The building-trade is pretty Avell
organised in Melbourne these days, with
builders paying fairly solid wages to their
available men. The rank-and-filer, such as
the carpenter and bricklayer, gets a plain,
unvarnished screw for a good deal of hard
Avork; but special tradesmen, such as tilers
and tuckpointers, draw nice pay for their
easy jobs. They are rather exclusive, too,
and do some strange things to the boss. The
other day a tiler found the wooden battens
already in place to receive the tiles. A car-
penter had done the Avork, and to the layman
the job Avould appear to have been within his
proper sphere. But not so. Putting the
battens on is one of the tiler’s own sacred
privileges, wherefore the new hand, as soon
as he found out who had done the bit of
work, picked up his nosebag and traps and
started to depart. Explanations availed
nothing. The only way for the boss to
retain the tiler’s urgently-needed services was
to, have the carpenter pull off the battens and
let the tiler nail them on again. It was done.
* * * *
“ Jacko”: What is badly wanted, both
immediately and to guarantee the future of
the fruit industry, is an organised effort at
case-making. With boxes selling at Is. Bd.
each there ought to be any amount of money
in meeting the urgent demand. The big
growers in the western part of the Ma State
are just now stampeding among themselves
for supplies for the coming season, without
anything very distinct in sight. The hard-
wood boxes that the Sydney sawmills turn
out from yard scraps won’t be touched while
the pine containers are available, which
isn’t always. The working of the mountain
ash hasn’t been taken up too enthusiastically.
The only thing calculated to box the future
is a sound policy of pine culture by the
State, as is being done in Victoria and better
still in Maoriland. Some of the western
slopes in N. S. Wales will grow com-
mon white pine to perfection, and the tree
is relatively lively in maturing. Anyway,
the western apple-men are working up a
strong argument for presentation to the Gov-
ernment, and the Government will use a
strong arm in the direction of a pigeon-hole
—made of imported wood, probably.
**9 * *
“Allowance” post-offices in Victoria have
lately come in for a share of attention as
sweat-shops. P.M.G. AVebster’s notice has
been drawn to a country office where the
missus in charge bags a whole 455. a month
for attending to three mails a week, as well
as monej 7 order and savings bank business,
the recording and sending of telephone-mes-
sages and the payment of old age and
soldiers’ pensions.
* * * *
“Y.Z.”: The price of washing-soda to the
housewife in Melbourne just now is another
proof of the piteous inability of Australians
to help themselves even after Heaven has
helped them in generous abundance. Four-
pence a pound was the cost of the last little
lot of soda crystals introduced into my wash-
house. Before the war the price was 21b. for
lid., and the excuse is that soda has been
almost monopolised for munitions. This does
not surprise me, as I have heard a tradesman
plead that the comparative dearness of
golden syrup is due to the extraordinary
demand of that commodity for the manufac-
ture of'explosives. There is enough waste salt
about A’ictoria’s north-western lake country
to provide Australia with all the soda it
needs, but Australia is still in the aboriginal
stage in connection with hundreds of manu-
factures, the only alternative to getting the
goods from other people being the crude
policy of going without.
* * * *
“8.G.E.” : Re “F.N.T.’s” experience of imi-
tation Swedish safety-matches made in Japan.
I lately bought in Sydney a small Copenhagen
vase for £3 3s. It was shown as “something
quite new. Japanese fireglaze porcelain and
pottery of a very line kind.” It certainly
looked it. The various designs and shapes
were excellent. I bought a piece labelled
9s. 6d. On removing this tag the well-known
Royal Doulton, England, lion brand was re-
vealed, so well copied that only a weakness
of faulty stamping in a couple of letters
marred the otherwise perfect likeness.
* * *
“Menado”: An English company which
went into business in the Celebes some years
ago tried to lift itself by paying the local
Malay twice the ruling rate of wages. It
soon found that its men worked only one
week or less in a fortnight. AVhen asked
why they did not buckle to and rake in the
big wages they replied that they could earn
enough in one week to last them for two or
three, so what was the use of overdoing
things ?
“Red Tape”: I challenge “Terry Hy Hie”
(B. 26/9/T8) to bring one scintilla of real
evidence in support of his outcry re missing
traction-engines at Yanco (N.S.AV.). It is
wonderful how tenacious of life these hoary
lies are. Thirteen or fourteen years ago
there was a similar yarn about two traction-
engines belonging to a Government depart-
ment in.Ahctoria. It was about as correct
as “Terry Hy Hie's.”
“Country Peel”: The furniture salesman
was showing a prospective buyer round the
showroom of a large Melbourne store. They
came to a beautiful bedroom suite priced at
a high figure. “That’s a nice suite,” said
the customer. “AVhat’s it made of?” “Tas-
manian oak,” replied the salesman, without
a blush. The customer took a closer view.
“Look here,” he said, “I’m willing to bet
you £lO to nothing that that’s not oak —Tas-
manian or any other sort. It’s just plain
stringy-bark.” The salesman smiled wearily.
“You’re quite right,” he said ; “but the trade
calls it Tasmanian oak, and that settles all
arguments as far as we’re concerned, sir.”
“Norbell”: I passed the time of day to my
neighbor, Professor Zeno, the eminent phre-
nologist, psychic, palmist, clairvoyant, mind-
reader and past, present and future-monger.
He conducts his furtive profession next door.
I inquired if business was booming. “Ah!”
he sighed, “it’s a hard and trying life. AA r hat
with the police, and informers, and pimps,
and spies it's enough to give a man the heart-
disease. But the other day I got the worst
knock yet. I’ve fixed up my little den to look
real well. It was only one room, but I
divided it with curtains and called the out-
side compartment “The AVaiting Room”
and the inner “The Cave of Mystery.” I
bought a square of carpet, a gipsy table, a
few chairs and odds and ends at a sale and
made the waiting-room look quite the thing.
The only item of any real value in the place
was an oil-painting that I’d had for years
and I’d refused £2O for. It was handsomely
framed, and I hung it in the most conspicu-
ous place in the waiting-room. Pretty early
one morning last week the bell rang. The
visitor was a young woman, a bit shy, and
she whispered that she wanted to have her
fortune told. I told her to kindly wait for
a few minutes as I was engaged with another
client. Of course I wasn’t, but it impresses
’em more if you make ’em wait a bit. So I
retired to the Cave of Mystery and mumbled
a pretended conversation for about five
minutes. Then I said out loud: ‘Thank
you, Madam : you may retire this way if you
wish.’ (I’ve got a dummy door in the Cave.)
And then I came out smiling to meet the wait-
ing lady. She was nowhere in sight. I
looked up and down the street, but there was
no one to be seen. I came inside thinking
she’d got scared, and cleared out. I looked
round the waiting-room, and then I tumbled.
She’d got away with my valuable painting!
Dishonesty makes this city a by-word.”

This skeleton . view shows
the method of morticing and
tenoning each joint in the
back of the Beale Piano —a
most essential construction
to insure tone-permanency /
\ and long life. fK
Enlarged section of the
bass end of sound-
board. As the strings
in the bass vibrate at a
much slower rate than
the treble, the wood at
this end of the sound-
board is coarser.
How Perfect Tone-quality is Assured
'THE sound-board has rightly been called the “soul” of a piano. It must be
* constructed of most carefully selected timber and be scientifically graded so
as to sympathetically respond to the vibrations of the strings. This is work
for experts —craftsmen who are thoroughly conversant with acoustic principles
and know how to apply them.
In the making of the Beale Piano the sound-board is
constructed in exactly the same way as the belly of a
violin. 1 he, best quality white pine is used —clear,
straight-grained' wood that has the most resonant
properties of all woods for this purpose. The
sound-board is not one big piece of wood —but is
built up of small strips of about six inches width.
These are graded from very coarse grain in the bass
to very fine in the treble. The ribs are manufactured
from clear-grained fir and each one is not only glued
to the back of the board, but screwed as well. These
ribs are of a particular shape which gives a convex
surface to the front of the board. Then when the
bridges are affixed and the strings placed into
position the sound-board deflects the tone waves in
exactly the same way as does the belly of a violin.
This convex surface —or camber —must be perma-
nent, otherwise tone-quality will be impaired. Every
Beale sound-board is guaranteed in writing, for 25
years. Even in the far north of Queensland the
Beale Piano retains its fine gradations of tone —a
clear, bell-like treble; a rich, singing, mellow middle
register, and a deep sonorous, powerful bass.
The Beale Piano is made in several styles. The “Players ” are fitted with most reliable actions, and have a control
that enables the instrument to be enjoyed by those musicians who have not been able to attain technical proficiency

YOU’LL grant without argument
* that 70/- is an economical price
for a good tailored suit.
Well, London Tailored Suits ARE
good, and their price is 70/-. The
reason we can combine such real
quality with such a moderate price
is that we permanently practise
economy—and don’t occasionally
preach it.
Our great turnover gives big buying
economics, and our method of oper-
ating demands the cutting out of
such unnecessary costs as sales-
men’s fees and expenses.
We Sell Direct to
the Wearer—-by Mail.
These basic savings enable us to sell well-made,
long-wearing suits at 70/-
London Tailoring patterns for Summer are amazingly
good. Made up into perfect-fitting, smartly-styled
models to measure, they will prove a revelation to
you men who have heretofore paid more than we ask for

(1) TREAD. —Corrugated, presenting small sur-
face to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TREAD. —4 great thickness of rubber, which
is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BREAKER STRIP, which,'' being made of
loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the tread
to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PURE, RUBBER.—Pure Rubber is placed
under Breaker Strip.
(5) CARCASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy,
long-fibre canvas, heavily impregnated with
rubber.
(6) FULL AIR SPACE.
(7) SIDE WALLS. —Realising the severe work
tyres are called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,
as often happens in other makes of tyres after
a few months’ service. Other makes have
very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-
coated with rubber, to prevent rust.

The J. arid N. Tait brotherhood launched
its interesting Repertory scheme at a pub-
lic meeting in the Palace (Sydney)
on Friday afternoon. There wasn’t a very
large audience to listen to the speeches, but
the Sydney playgoer who Avants something
better than the “commercial” plays now on
tap can atone by sending his or her name
and address (endorsed “Repeftory”) to J.
and N. Tait, Banking House, Pitt-street.
The Australian Repertory movement has
never had such a shove as this, and isn’t
likely to get another in a hurry unless the
playgoer does his bit by providing a steady
stream of satisfactory matinee, audiences.
That is the only difficulty; 1 the Taits can’t
see their Avay at present to give the Roper
to Liana a night. It would be different, of
course, if they had a spare theatre. They
have proved themselves good friends by pro-
viding a theatre, financial backing and first-
class professional casts, and it is only
businesslike to give the idea a trial Avith
afternoon performances before side-tracking,
oven for one night a week, a successful show
in its stride. Gfegan McMahon, who put up
such a fine record with the Melbourne
Repertory Theatre, is to be in charge, and a
start will be made shortly Avith Shaw’s
“The Doctor’s Dilemma.” Other dramatists
already on the “waiting” list are Galsworthy,
Ibsen. Granville Barker. St. John Ilankin.
Euripides and Arnold Bennett. Also the
Australian playwright is to get a look in.
Both on patriotic and artistic grounds the
scheme deserves support. It will probably
win a lot of enthusiastic casual support as
it develops.
“Stargazer”; I have heard only one actor
preach the doctrine of painful vicissitude for
the profession, and that was George Rig-
nold. “We’re pampered and spoiled nowa-
days,” he said. “We look for nothing but
praise, and whimper if there isn’t enough of
it, and if it isn’t thick and slab. How
many young actors of to-day have been hit
with an egg? Nobody throws' eggs nowa-
days ; never were actors more deserving of
eggs, I Avas once knocked right out with a
large turnip. It hit me in the solar plexus.
That turnip did me good. More vegetables
and .less jam, that is the need of the times.
Professionally speaking, I am a vegetarian.
Actors thrive on vegetables if they are any
good ; if they’re not any good they go under
—under the onions—and everybody is better
off. Once at Bendigo I saw a rich ama-
teur Hamlet smothered with eggs. The eggs
Avere bad, but so wls the Hamlet. Hamlet
gave up the ghost there and then. Audiences
have the right, tq hjiss; more, they have a
duty so to do if the acting provokes it. News-
paper praise for a bad actor is as immoral as
public applause for an ulcer. There’s D
whining like a child over the asser-
tion that his lago is a failure, and every
night he emphasises the fact Avith public
demonstrations. The game is dying—dying,
and the trouble is fatty degeneration of the
art.”
Those one-time Australian infant prodi-
gies, Lorna and Toots Pounds, are now
bright stars in revue at the Alhambra
(London) as dancers, singers and mimics.
“L.H.P.”: Re the recent revival in Mel-
bourne of “The Black Cloaks.” In
’B2 A. T. Dunning brought out a very
fine London co. to play “Boccaccio,”
“Manola,” “The Black .Cloaks,” “Rip
Van Winkle” and “The King’s Dra-
goons” for the first time here. The princi-
pals included Annette Ivanova, Kate Chard,
Agnes Consuelio, Knight Ashton, Dean
Brand, Mons Loredan, T. B. Appleby and
Johnny Wallace, Avho first came here with
Soldene in ’77. The troupe lasted about
three years. Emelie Melville came in ’B3
Avith “Fatinitza” and “The Royal Middy” as
novelties, and revivals of “Angot,” “Peri-
chole,” “Boccaccio,” etc. Her .support in-
cluded Armes Beaumont, Ted Farley,
Johnny Fordo, ,1. P. O’Neil, Frances Saville
and Gracie Plaisted. James Alison and
George Rignold in ’B9, or thereabouts, ran
a shoAy Avith “Falka” and “Nell Gwynne” as
novelties, and Verdi, Fannie Liddiard, Beau-
mont, Geo. Dean, Colboume Baber, and
Emelie Melville in the leads. Also about
this period Majeroni and Wilson’s comic-
opera troupe flourished with Luscombe
Soarello’s “Bobadil” and “Isadora,” done
later in London as “The Black Rover,” plus
sundry French comic operas and “Maritana”
and “The Bo’ Girl.” Principals Avere Chas.
Harding, Lithgow James, Geo. Leopold, J.
H. South, E. Lester, Flo Saville, Fannie
Liddiard and Gracie Plaisted. Brough and
Beucicault gave a semi-opera burlesque show
in 1887-8 with “Dick,” “Little Jack Shep-
herd” and “The Forty Thieves” as novelties,
and Fanny Robina, Teddy Royce, Emma
Temple, Flo Harcourt, Chas. Brown, E. B.
Manning and Brough as chief fun providers.
Henry Bracy and John Solomon managed a
troupe in 1888-9 Avith "The Beggar Stu-
dent,” “The Sultan of Mocha” and Kowal-
ski’s “La Moustique” as attractions, varied
by grand-opera revivals. Their programmes
included the Braeys, Flora Graupner, Louise
Lablache. Lilian Tree, Cicely Staunton,
Stockwcll and Farley as artistes.
Adelaide entertainment proprietors are
upset over the additional Federal tax on
.amusements. The State tax increased 3d.
and Gd. tickets to 3Jd. and (Ed., and the
Federal clutch will make them 4id. and
7-id. respectively. S. Aus. is the only state

Steyne) discuss life.
where a double tax is levied, and it certainly
seems over the fence to pinch the kids so
hard. It is suggested that the State tax
should be repealed to put local show-
goers on the same basis as the other States.
For Is. and higher-priced seats S. Australians
pay twice as much into the revenue as else-
Avhere in the Commonwealth. A ss. ticket,
for instance, costs ss. lOd. as against ss. sd.
“Bob Ray”; I know that George Rignold
occasionally acted characters that were quite
unsuited to his style (for instance, Shaun,
in “Arrah Na Pogue,” in which he was quite
out of the picture), but I can’t imagine tfie
burly actor attempting to appear as the
weakly stripling Pierre is supposed to be (B.
10/10/’18). Rignold produced the “Two
Orphans” in 1890 with brother William as
Jacques. A. E. Greenaway, now with
Emelie Polini, Avas an excellent Pierre;
Bessie Rignold and Roland Watts Phillips
were the orphans. George revived the play
in 1894, himself playing the ruffian Jacques,
a character in every Avay more suitable to
his size and methods than that of Pierre
On this occasion Scot luglis, long since num-
bered with the gone, was the crippled hero.
Harold Allert, a brisk little amateur com-
edian of a few years back in
Adelaide, is now in business in
New York. He lias just been
back on a visit to~his old home,
and was lunched by the Johnian
Club (which is the more digni-
tied title now taken on by his
old associates, the St. John’s Young Men’s
Society).
“Norbell”: Out at Bungledoo I found a
tent, bearing a calico sign which announced,
“The Marvellous Collection of Life-like
Celebrities, Being the Most Stupendous
Exhibition of Waxworks Ever Brought to
This District.” When I got inside P found
that I was the only patron. The proprietress
took my shilling and sobbed. She was in
the state defined by the doctors as “alcoholic
depression.” As I glanced around at the
dozen or so of wax horrors she entertained
me with her troubles. * She assured me that
her partner was a good man when not in
drink, and then asked plaintively, “But who
the divil can keep ’im off it? What I’ve
done an’ gorn through for that there man,
only the angels above can tell. ’E’s starved
an’ stoushed me, till I’ve ’ad to wear a thick
gossamer to ’ide me eyes from the public.
D’ye see me feet?” (She exhibited them en-
cased in carpet slippers.) “I’ve nothing else
to put on. Deeming there is wearing me
only decent pair of boots.” She glared round
for a minute and then began to wail again,
“Look at that!” she moaned. “Look what
that brute’s done ! He’s put me best trans-
parent blouse on Kate Kelly!”
“Benicia”: “Hilary Lofting’s”. musings (B.
19/9/T8) are somewhat disordered. So far
from spouting stories of Irish peasants to
Yeats when they first met in Paris, Synge
had, accbrding to Yeats, nearly forgotten all
he ever knew of the Gaelic tongue; and, as
to the reception of the plays,. Dublin cer-
tainly went to the show; but only to jeer
and yell,' not to acclaim the one modern
prose dramatist fit to rank with Shakespeare
and Congreve. The Irish, no less than the
rest of the world, have accepted the stage
Irishman as a typical peasant. With that
lack cxl’ humor inherent in • most humorous
peoples, they fail to see themselves as they
really are, and when Synge gave them a
plain untouched photograph they adjourned
as one .map to DonnybroolL ■ Because he was
an artist, as purely objective in his view as
it is possible for any artist to be, Synge
did not even think of any political effect his
plays might have. His first produced play,
“The Shadow of the'Glen,” with its Norah
Burke, who, at the pinch, followed her own
inclinations in the matter of a man. pushed
the Nationalists’ trump card, i.e., the chas-
tity of Irish womanhood. The beauty of the
play was nothing to the politicians, for, as
one writer has it, “To the majority of Irish-
men art still means a political pamphlet.”
“Riders to the Sea,” the most truly great
short play ever written, failed, at first, to
attract audiences. “The Playboy of the
Western World” gave Sinn Fein its first
opportunity to rehearse in public. The riot
started in the theatre and spread to the
street. The National Theatre Society itself
was divided -by civil war. There was the
same story to tell of the first stagings in
London and America, and I am willing to
wager with “Hilary Lofting” that, when this
play arrives in Australia, the opposition will
be headed by Mannix himself. To say that
Synge lit the torch of Irish Renaissance is
bosh. Yeats had been working and weaving
fine stuff for years, and Lady Gregory’s plays
had made a stir before Synge went to the
Aran Isles. What happened was that the
torch lit the blazing fire that was Synge.
“Repertory Enthusiast” : Several members
of Miss Horniman’s famous combination of
Repertory players are in Australia at present
or had been lately. Sara Allgood, who Avon
fame with the Abbey Theatre co. in Dublin
(also at one time supported financially by Miss
Hornimanl, made good with the Manchester
players. lan Maclaren was a leading man
there for some time, and Edward Landor
(now en route to the Front in khaki) shone
in character parts. Cecil Brooking repeated
his Mr. Dreiv in “Nan” (which he played
at the Haymarket, London), and his Brindley
in “What the Public Wants” (in which he
first appeared at Glasgow), in Manchester.
London, Oxford and Cambridge, and in
Montreal, Ottawa, Boston and Chicago, dur-
ing the two seasons played by the Horniman
co. overseas in 1911 and 1912. His name
THE ERROR.
“They asked me to their reception , hut it
wasn’t because they liked me; it was
only because I can sing.”
“Oh, I'm sure you’re mistaken, dear!”
appears, too, in several of the casts of origi-
nal plays produced at .Manchester and with
the Scottish Players at Glasgow. Doris Gil-
liam (at present in sneezy South Africa)
once graced the Royalty Theatre, Glasgow,
too. There Madge Mclntosh was to be
seen, and Norman McKeown, perhaps the
only Australian actor to penetrate behind
the veil of British Repertory, played Dick
Gurist in “Nan” uncommonly well. He is
now in the trenches.
“Monkbarns” : I celebrate a forgotten Mel-
bourne theatre-—the Prince of Wales, which
ran through from Little Bourke-street, at the
back of the Theatre Royal, to Lonsdale-street.
It began as a circus, Rowe’s Hippodrome, and
was later turned into the Prince of Wales,
afterwards the Lyceum. It was under the
management of the brothers Richard and
Frederick Younge (not related to Charley
Young). . After the Younges, W. Ryan
(Arrowsmith) managed it. The Melbourne
Hospital authorities eventually got it abol-
ished, through danger of fire. It became
Garton’s Livery Stable, and so remains.

The Gar of Quality
150,000 Last Year!
—the enormous annual output of Overland motor cars!
Many thousands of them went to all parts of the world. The Overland
is indeed the international motor car, because it is made on a scale which
permits a value unapproached!
Appearance, performance, comfort, service, price - all these essen-
tials of the ideal motor car are distinct Overland advantages.
For instance, note the “85-Four” shown here. A car of great power,
but so simple to operate that a child can drive it. Sturdy, depend-
able, so satisfactory that it has won the enthusiasm of everyone who
ever owned one.

There is a lot of natural mechanical
genius kicking about the bush in Australia.
Close to Trunkey (N.S.W.) there is a port-
able steam-engine rather unusually situated,
in that it is driving a circular saw in front,
while behind it stands an eight-head battery
ready to crush stone when required. But
the most novel feature is a Yankee lowdown
or Dodger hand-pump, attached to the steam
end of an old Blake pump, the idea and work
of a 16-year-old boy named Henry. Hand-
pumping being laborious, and the old Blake
being only good as to its steam end, young
Henry connected the two, finder bars, slide
blocks, etc., being fashioned by himself out of
good Australian hardwood. A city mechanic
would have raved if told to bring about such
a result with such materials and tools, but
the contraption works. The inventive
bushboy and his woodwork indicate what
material and talent is going to waste
for want of the mechanical industries that
we may have some day, if we put real Aus-
tralians in to run the country.
“The Old Soldier”: “Centurion” (B.
3/10/’3B) gives rather a curious description
of the swords that have (according to
coble) been issued to the Australian Light
Horse in Palestine. He says the swords
have “no cutting edge,” and the drill for
them has only “one point and one parry.”
How is a horseman whose charger is gallop-
ing at 12 or more miles an hour to give point
to his opponent? One of the two men, per-
haps both, would be run through the body.
“Centurion” describes the old-fashioned duel-
ling-sword, now worn by people in Court
dress (maybe Billy Hughes sports it at Wind-
sor), but it has not a “needle-point.” On
foot, or moving slowly when mounted, the
point is much more formidable than the edge
in the hands of a really skilful swordsman
who can fence; but if the point is driven
home by excessive force and penetrates too
far, it becomes difficult to withdraw it, be-
cause the flesh closes round the blade and
makes it impossible for a mounted man to
recover. It has therefore been laid down
that charging cavalry must not use the point,
but only the edge of the sword till the charg-
ing bodies have lost the impetus of the
charge. That does not often happen; but
cavalrymen have been known to be dragged
from their horses by the weight of heavy
men whom they have stabbed in a rush.
That very nearly happened to Jacob, the
famous commandant of the Sind Horse. He
was only saved by the strap he was using
as a sword-knot breaking when he was
nearly exhausted by the strain of a heavy
man hanging from his wrist. What would
the Indian native cavalry say if their cut-
ting talwarg were to be taken from them
and replaced with small swords? It would
cause a ferment that would not be easily
allayed.
The sinking of the big passenger ferry-
boat Leinster was a special atrocity in any
case. And being done just when the Hun
was talking of peace, and when he was
assuring the Allies that Germany had fin--
ished with the old brutal military rdgime, it
was grotesque as well as atrocious. But the
N. S. Wales Labor bosses go stolidly along
with their referendum about giving their
Hun friend back all his colonies and other
properties and not levying any fine upon
him. They haven’t even mentioned that they
felt shocked. Apparently all the horrors in
earth and Sheol wouldn’t shake their slavish
devotion to a rotten idea.
“R.A.Y.”: Another illustration of N. S.
Wales Works Department’s business effici-
ency. A dozen years ago a worked-out quarry
near Clarence Heads, with about four miles
of railway line, was abandoned, and all the
plant removed, except a locomotive, which
was left in a shed on a siding. A few years
later the Department sold the shed for a
few pounds and it was removed, leaving the
locomotive exposed to the weather. Still
later the line was lifted, excepting the rails
on which the engine stood. Now, after a
further long interval the Works crowd is
calling tenders for the purchase of the
engine; lowest or any tender not necessarily
accepted. Which means that if offers are
not up to reserve, the ancient machine will
be left to season for a few more years until
its value improves.
“G.A.” : Re paper-making from rags. E. 11.
Gambling, of Adelaide, is doing something for
the conservation of waste material for paper-
making. He has new premises in Adelaide
where girls .are' busy sorting out different
grades of waste paper. After grading it is
placed in bales and rammed to a convenient
size for forwarding to the Australian Paper
Mills Co., Melbourne. All descriptions of
waste paper Can be used, but there is even
more value in rejected garments, and Gam-
bling declares that from prime rags he can
make cream-woven paper; from that he can
make best writing-paper, then cheap writing-
paper, then good printing-paper, then news-
paper printing-paper, then cardboard, and
then strawboard. If he can secure the material
he says he can supply half the quantity of
paper for South Australian requirements.
Gambling contends that waste clothing con-
verted into flock is not hygienic. He does not
want to compete with flockmakers in buying
old garments, but thinks they should be util-
ised for raw materials. Rags used for paper-
making are rendered innocuous by chemical
processes. The Adelaide Council is giving a
month’s trial to saving waste paper and
rags from the rubbish-destructor to see if it
pays.
Some more about the Watt Government’s
(that’s the National Government that repre-
sents the Watt class) price-fixing scheme: —
The Federal Government has decided to appoint
an advisory committee of business men to assist the
Minister for Price Fixing, Mr. Massy Greene, and
the Chief Prices Commissioner, Mr. P. Whitton, in
the administration of the prices regulations and
related matters. Mr. Greene explained to-day that
this committee would act entirely in an advisory
capacity, and it was thought would be of material
assistance in solving the many intricate business
problems that cropped up from time to time in the
administration of the regulations. The names of the
committee are: Mr. Marcus Clark (Messrs. Marcus
Clark and Co., Ltd., Sydney), Mr. C. J. Henty (Par-
bury, Hentv and Co., Sydney), Mr. A. D. Price
(Price, Griffiths and Co., Melbourne), and Mr. Win.
Harper (Robert Harper and Co., Ltd., Melbourne).
Now. if a committee was set up by Watt to
fix the price of wharf-lumper’s labor would
lie appoint half a dozen lumpers? Perhaps
P.M.G. Webster will write the answer in
verse.

Evolving with
the Times.
A new and entirely novel multiple
drive-plate has just been patented by
Quirks Lighting and Engineering,
Ltd.
Clockwork Precision.
This device supersedes the old chain
system of drive connecting the rotary
axle of the winding drum, blower
spindle and petrol shaft. Experts claim
that for a lighting system where abso-
lute clockwoyk precision is essential,
this invention is one of the most unique
and effective yet devised. It reduces
the mechanism of the machine down to
simplicity itself—and simplicity and
effectiveness are the chief recommenda-
tion in machinery where steadiness is a
sine qua non to the maximum of suc-
cess.
New Drive Discovery.
T lie steady pressure of the weight oper-
ating in conjunction with the new drive
patent is what all lighting experts''have
been striving for during the past half-
century, but. not until'now have the
World's brains been able to evolve such
a subtle invention, which ensures the
steadiest light yet produced by any self-
contained system.
Stcaoy as the Sunlight
Xo combustion, no distressing of
engines, no attendant vibration or other
disabilities, but a silent, constant and
steady pressure, producing for the
country or suburban home brighter and
better light than anything the public
has yet seen, free from the worries of
complicated mechanism and as steady
as the sunlight itself.
Safety of Your Home.
A child can understand the new model
Quirk plant, and the parents may be
assured, that no matter what may be
done, save smashing the machine up,
not the least harm will befall anyone
associated with it.

NERVOUS DYSPEPSIA.
Nervous dyspepsia is a disease of the
nerves, not of the stomach.
Indigestion one day and complete freedom
from symptoms the next usually means ner-
vous dyspepsia, especially if the patient is of
a ?, ei ' vous or highly emotional temperament.
The attacks recur at more or less regular,
intervals and are often brought on by ner-
vous excitement. A sick feeling after eating,
sometimes vomiting, a weak, shakv, “gone”
feeling when the stomach is empty—these
are the usual symptoms, hut in the case of
some highly nervous people the sight of food
or the approach of meal-time may cause
vomiting.
Dr. A\ illiams’ Pink Pills are especially use-
ful to sufferers from nervous dyspepsia, as
they. not only build up the general physical
condition, but also act directly on the nerves,
strengthening and revitalising them. These
pills, with proper regulation of the diet,
afford the most correct and successful way
in which nervous and functional dvspepsia
can be treated.
Two booklets. ‘’Diseases of the Nervous
System and ‘‘What to Eat and How to
Eat,” will be sent free on request by the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.. Box 594 G.P.0..
Sydney. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold
by all chemists and storekeepers at 2/9 per
box ; six boxes 15/8. — Advt.
What Kind of Peace?
The proposition on which a trades-union
ballot is now being taken is that Australia
should call on the British Government to
seek “peace bv negotiation without’ penal in-
demnities or annexations" (the saving word
"penal, hitherto niostb- forgotten, has been
remembered this time). Failing the British
Government's acceptance of the proposal, the
giving of any further assistance to the Avar is
to be discouraged as far as possible. Voting
on this dodgy and sidelong proposition is
now in progress, but as to the meaning of it
no explanation ivhalsoever is in progress,
though explanations have been asked for often
enough, and are as badly wanted as anything
Avell can be. There are three questions that
rise up like three ghosts or Job’s three com-
forters, and refuse to be laid :
(1) Is the Hun to pay anything at all foe the
destruction of undefended towns, the wrecking of
churches, koines, farms, mines and other things, and
for the hundreds of millions’ worth of plunder he has
seized and carted away? Is he to pay an//tiling.
even Is. in the £, for actual damage done? The
crowd which runs this peace show carefully avoids
committing itself. It says that the Hun isn’t to pay
for more than material damage, but it won’t sav
straight out that lie in to pay for material damage.
(2) Is the “peace" to include all the nations that
have been at war, or only those that are at war
now? The linns say that it is absurd to talk about
making peace where it has been made already, and
as Russia and Boumania are now at peace the agree-
ment with them must stand as a matter of course.
That agreement gives Germany so much territory that
its strength will be almost doubled for the next War,
gigantic indemnities, and a practical monopolv of
trade for 90 years. It even provides that the Hun
shall have a monopoly of banking, and that the
Russians must not start so much as a local savings
bank without Hun permission. All the petrol qf the
two countries, which represent the bulk of the
world’s supply outside the U.S., is, of course, to be
reserved for the Hun, so that the industries of other
nations will be crippled. The Australian “peace”
leaders ask their blind followers to vote blindly with-
out knowing whether their “yes" is to be taken as
affirming this monstrous and ruinous steal. Why
don’t they say- whether they accept the Hun inter-
pretation of “peace" or i.ot—whether in addition to
making a peace without annexations they are or are
not ready to upset a peace to prevent annexations?
(3) Does the “no annexations” clause mean leav-
ing all the subject races under the yoke of their old
alien masters, and in such cases as those of the
Czechs and Slovaks and Austrian Serbs and Austrian-
Italians to the vengeance of their infuriated alien
masters ?
I lie main propositions in the hazy rigmarole,
which the mass of Laborites are requested
to accept without being so impertinent
as to ask for explanations, were made
in Germany, They were devised by Germans
as noble and plausible sentiments with which
the Bolshevik leaders, hired by Germany
might beguile the people. They have been
copied in Australia by a crowd which, if it
isnt a Hun agency, looks very like one.
Therefore some honest plain speaking—not
platitudinous speaking—would be in order.
Bert R.”: Heartily endorse “Dingo’s” re-
marks (B. 3/10/T8) re military tourists. At
Jeast oO per cent, of the men on the boat in
which I was returned had not seen any din-
kum service: but most of them had seen all
the sights in England and Scotland. The
detail camps are full of these “Salisbury
I lain Anzacs. who sport, battalion colors
and often two or Ihree wounded stripes. A
favorite lurk with them to get home when
they are tired of joy-riding is to parade sick
at Ilorseferry-road. The M.O. there, used
to men breaking down while on leave from
'■ ranee, sends them to Southall for a spell
where synovitio, or a similar complaint, pur-
posely aggravated, does the rest. Even then
they are not finished with. Recently in the
Reps, a member complained that these men
were not being fairly treated, and Acting-
Prime Minister Watt promised to look into
it. I hope he meant it.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” wheels in a few
more pubs:—•
I see that tenders have been called for the erec-
tion of new .premises for the South British Insurance
Co on the corner of Hunter and O’Connell streets,
Sydney. In the mid ’forties there was a job and
livery stables at 354 Pitt-street, next door to John
Hcssking’s fine house, since wiped out by Moore-street
being butted in. A public-house stood on the corner,
mimed The Horse and Jockey, which had for its
second landlord one Sullivan, who in time gave way
U) Johnny Solomon, who later kept the Sir Maurice
O’Connell Inn, a fine building of the old type, which
stood back from the pathway on the corner (east) of
Elizabeth and Hunter streets. The Horse and Jockey
had a keen competitor in the Currency Lass, on the
corner of Pitt and Hunter streets. In 1873 one
Perkins had the Horse and Joekev. 'ln 187r> it
was plastered with “To Let” bills. Next rear a
German opened it as the Royal Mail, but gave it
best in quick time. Then it became a nest of
offices, amongst the most notable tenants being
Oeoige I*. Want, stock and station agent. When
Want went to England the Equitable Insurance Co.
took over the premises.

more than a temporary success. The
reefs usually pinched out at a small depth,
and. in addition, in the case of gold, the
precious metal soon became involved with
pyrites, the stone requiring a special and
expensive treatment. The old Belmore Silver
and Lead Mining Co. left a pile of costly
machinery and a tall blast-furnace at the
failure. Belmore was Governor
or IS. S. Wales. In the same vicinity is a
cenotaph to the memory of William! Earl
of Ancnmi, in the Scottish Debrett, killed
there by the accidental discharge of a gun.
He was aide to Governor Jersey, and his
remains rest in Waverley Cemetery. Sydney,
unless, as some assert, they were transported
to-the land of his. ancestors, who were short
of land as it was.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, October 21, 191 S.
My Dear Arini, —
Sydney had a feeling of being right in
front of a red-hot oven with the door open
when some of the original Anzacs made a
triumphant procession through its beflagged
streets. Thousands of citizens cheered the
returned men. The V.'G.’s in front were
tanned of skin, bright eyed, and, in most
cases, joyously spirited. The Lord Mayor’s
carriage, drawn by gun-horses, a-top of which
with sure and easy seat were soldier riders,
caught the kiddies’ fancy, and shrill treble
yells of joy hailed this feature of the pro-
cession. In the Town Hall wild tumults of
applause from a surging crowd of women
and children greeted everything in khaki.
The great organ (Ernest Truman at
the keys) poured out its heart to
the occasion, and peaceful citizens, not
given to singing in public, upraised their
voices to “Rule Bi’itannia” in any handy
key. They meant well, and as the soldiers
hadn’t any artillery with them the damage was
t rifling. On the platform were the V.C.’s—the
last to arrive, Kenny, V.C., a smiling young
Australian, had to stand up (there was a slim
six feet or more of him) to satisfy the up-
roarious welcome. Lieut. Keysor, V.C., then
bowed his thanks. Governor Davidson and
his lady. Mayor Joynton Smith, in rabbit-fur,
and Chief-Secretary Fuller were prominent
at the great welcome.
There’s to be a mighty tuning of fiddles
this week-end for Melba’s matinee concert
with Verbrugglien’s orchestra, and the Town
flail will need a pair of elastic sides, for
the booking is stupendous. Soldiers’ De-
pendants’ Day Fund gets the profits. Oct.
26 is the date. Melba stepped off the Mel-
bourne express on Sunday, and is camping at
Government House.
At the Red Cross Rose Fete for Jack’s
Day on Saturday, in Centennial Park, a
large area was gay with striped tents.
V.A.D. workers, scores of side-shows, a glori-
fied playground for kiddies, and military
sports, wherein was depicted a mimic battle
with the requisite thunder of artillery.
The sports committee worked for weeks
to make the military exhibition the big
turn of the afternoon, and thousands
of citizens watched an imitation battle
arranged by- an officer gunner fresh from
personal experience of the battle-line in
France. As no entrance money can be
charged in a public park, the military had
to trust to the generosity of the visitors in
giving freely to Jack’s Day through the
Y.A.D. collection-boxes. Red Cross dames
could only moan softly for more boxes. Mrs.
George Lee was president of the sports com-
mittee. The hon. organiser was the artil-
lery officer who is N. S. Wales’s chief of the
gunners’ training-school at Liverpool. Mrs.
Oorbould. Captain Brownlow, R.A.N.,
Colonel Sanders. Major F. Parkes and Lieut.
Drummond made up a hardworking team.
Lieut. A. M. Porter was hon. sec. An inva-
sion of the military official-stand brought
the Davidsons as interested spectators. The
C.J. Cullens were in the party.
That inveterate rolling-stone Stacy
Waddy, parson and cricketer, will presently
go on travel again. Not long home after
serving as chaplain in the A.1.F., his thick
black crop will be fitted with whatever mil-
linery goes on the head of a canon in the
Anglican Cathedral, Jerusalem. The old King-
School’s ex-headmaster will probably lose; no
time in getting on 'a good cricket pitch in
the ancient city. Mrs. Waddv and the
youngsters go with him, but it’s a big change
in housekeeping.
Last week’s Elizabethan water pageant
for Jack’s Day just missed, bv reason of a
few weak points in its arrangement, being a
great show. This mid-week’s repeat per-
formance probably eliminated the delay in
leaving the city side of the harbor, and the
tardiness in getting crowded ferry-boats
alongside Clifton wharf. In spite of other
minor defects, such as an Elizabethan courtier
in doublet and hose (period 1540 or so)
stamping along in 1918 tan shoes embel-
lished with large brass buckles, the water-
party was a pictorial success. One ancient
chronicler coldly describes Elizabeth as “the
possessor of handsome features, but lacking
in fascination from her masculine habits.”
Mrs. Kelly (one of the organisers) was a
modern feminine edition, round and pretty,
of the mighty English queen whose high
cheekbones and asperity made her the terror
of weaklings. Bess, in cherry velvet, like
her courtiers, had too much mediaeval gloom
during her first progress round the lower
gallery of Clifton Gardens baths. On the
balcony above, the spectators were so densely
packed that at one crisis in the moonlight
pageant the sub-regal enclosure creaked
ominously. Governor Davidson and his lady
had the luck, however, to escape an avalanche
of our Best People rolling over the rail at
their backs. James Chalmers (associated
with Mrs. T.H.K. in organising the
show) made a personable Lord Burleigh.
Colonel Sanders was heavily disguised as the
Bishop of Lincoln. Duchesses and count-
esses —a prolific crop—followed the Court.
The banner of England went ahead of Ladies
of the Madrigal Society (in floppy blue
dresses) and iNeptune (Montgomery Stuart)
took a cold bath later in the evening. Nep-
tune’s daughters (Isma d’Ebro and Fanny
Durack) gave thrilling proofs of the
family’s specialty, despite the very chilly sea-
water. Queen Elizabeth Kelly, by the way,
was held up on her arrival by Neptune,
while he declaimed verses by John Sandes.
The Army Service Corps Depot girls have
secured one of the most unique treasures in
furniture that local raffle promoters ever laid
hands on. It is a sumptuous early Egyp-
tian suite —seven chairs and a settee —of
walnut, inlaid with mother o’ pearl. The
generous donor is K. Mockbell, of this city.
David Jones’s showroom, where the carved
suite reposes, is the Mecca of many travel-
lers in consequence. Tickets as. each. Hilda
Caro is the hon. organiser of this money-
raising notion.
Saturday is to be a busy day. The Royal
Historical Society has picked the date
(26th), which teems with Jack’s Day shows,
for its pilgrimage to Vaucluse House. Once
the home of William Charles Wentworth,
this gathering of people with long memories
has chosen the date of William’s birth. For
the making of reminiscent oratory the envi-
ronment of Vaucluse is ideal. The orator can
orate, and the listener who grows weary of
too much Wentworth can slip quietly away
into the wistaria-draped garden.
A repeat performance of Tschaikowsky’s
“Pathetique” Symphony lured a large audi-
ence of devotees to the Conservatorium the
other afternoon. Verbrugghen was in his
official pen in charge of an orchestra which
reflects the great conductor’s magnetic lead.
The first half of the massive programme was
nibbled away by Winifred Burston’s brilli-
ant performance of Liszt’s famous concerto
in E flat. Apropos is the fact that our sex
—in the person of a pianist of 16 summers,
one Sophie Menter —was the first to make
this concerto popular. That was in Vienna
in 1869.
The Australian artist is coming into his
(or her) deservings. And on the tide the
younger painters are
floating high.
Amongst them is
Olive Crane (photo
by May Moore), a
young girl whose
signature is now
well known on
charming Australian
Christmas and New
Year cards. The
pink-cheeked maid (a
B.A. of Sydney Uni-
versity by the way)
has been commis-
sioned by the pub-
lishers of “Riddle-
me-ree,” Zora Cross’s
verses for kiddies, to
do the illustrations.
She is a daughter of
Walter Crane, of Croydon, and she studied
for a time at Julian Ashton’s life class;
then went on, with Albert Collins as teacher,
to specialise in pen-and-ink drawings.
Frances Hodgkins’ pictures—oils and
water-colors —are now on view in Anthony
Horderns’ Art Gallery. The Maorilan'd
artist, who was here on a visit since the war,
is living on the other side. The German
invasion of France, in 1914, practically
broke up her big art-classes in Paris. Since
then she has mostly stuck to teaching and
sketching in the English midlands, a brief
effort to establish her easel near St. Ives
coast earlier in the fray being firmly dis-
couraged by the military brasshats.
Mrs. Kelso King has given to be raffled
for Jack’s Day a Queensland maple linen-
cupboard. Its contents, piles of snowy
damask, which make the spine of house
mothers tingle with covetousness, are valued
at £lOO. This treasure trove is on view at
Anthony Horderns’, where tickets (25.) are
going off like free buttered scones. Letters
addressed to Mrs. Kelso King, 120 Pitt-
street, will also get immediate attention.
The Methody Mission burst forth in a
Spring carnival the other day. Lady David-
son pronounced the opening benediction. The
Conference Hall, where black coats meet in
conclave, was the scene of festivity and
trade.
A swarm resembling the sudden upheaval
or an ants’ nest agitated the Australia
the other afternoon. Mercifully the weather
was cool. The soiree, at ss. a head (six-
pence extra for a seat at tea), was devised to
aid the A.M.C. fund. Roses fainted away
in the crowded room, while singers uplifted
their voices to tantalise the congregation
w 7 ith visions of green fields, running brooks
and other fresh-air fancies. Cora Randal
Carey was hon. sec. of the musical pro-
gramme.
While Gregan McMahon sat silent in the
stalls of the Palace Theatre, the battle for
the Repertory play in Sydney was fought
last Friday on the stage, which had a chaste
background, suitable to the aesthetic topic—
a scene-cloth with the cool design of a tiled
bathroom wall and some meek lilies-of-the-
valley sprouting in pots. Justice Heydon
took the referee’s chair. The speakers were
John Tait, of the firm which backs the
scheme, John Lane Mullins, M.L.C., T. R:
Bavin and Consett Stephen. The witty
speech of the last-named added some lustre
to the dry details of the Repertory in its
relation to profits.
The Australian Women's Service Corps
is going to roll up its sleeves and do a little
hammering, also sawing and ladder-climbing,
for the disabled fighting man. A returned
warrior’s home at Matraville, where the best
sand-dunes come from, is the A.W.S.C.’s
objective.
On October 26 the big marine carnival for
Jack’s Day will, d.v., cause money to roll
towards the cause from morn till eve. It’s
to be an amphibious animal with one foot
ashore in the Royal Sydney Yacht Squad-
ron’s lawns at Kirribilli.
A lot of romance attaches to the family
of William Broun, baronet, who died at
Manly the other day. Lie was the 10th
baronet, succeeding his father in 1882. When
20 years of age he left Scotland for Tas-
mania, and on crossing to N. S. Wales, in
1871, he married Alice Jane Peters, daughter
of J. C. Peters, wine and spirit merchant.
Three sons and three daughters survive him,
all on the land. The family is descended
from George Broun, who in the sixteenth
century married Jean Hay, daughter of Lord
Yester, ancestor of the Marquess of Tweed-
dale. The dowry of the lady consisted of the
famous “Coulston pear,” which her remote
ancestor, Hugh de Gifford, of Yester, a
famous necromancer, who died in 1267, was
supposed to have invested with the extraor-
dinary virtue of securing unfailing pros-
perity for the family who might possess it.
The pear is still preserved at Colston —or
was—and even when shorn of its supersti-
tious surroundings is a wonderful vegetable
curiosity. George Broun, the second baronet,
married Lady Elizabeth McKenzie, daughter
of the first earl of Cromarty, and it is re-
ported that during the first night of her
marriage, when she slept at Colston, she
dreamed she had eaten the pear. Her brother-
in-law looked upon this as a bad omen, and
expressed great fears that she would be an
instrument to destroy the house of Coulston.
Be this as it may, George sold the estates,
and in 171 S was drowned with his family on
the Tyne.
Major A. B. Douglas-Brown, formerly of
Bananaland (mother is now an Ashfield resi-
dent), has just added the Croix-de-Guerre to
the D.S.O. that came his way a few months
-ago. An elder brother, an original Anzac,
came home this year with the M.C. The
youngest of the trio is still pegging away
with the Light Horse in Palestine.
The gift sale for Jack’s Day came to a
head at Canberra House (city) this Mon-
day. His Ex. opened the great sacrifice, and
the spectator had to pay 2s. 6d. to the cause
for the privilege of standing-room.
The Australian Flying Corps angels will
get busy at their stall in Moore-street for
Jack’s Day. Contributions are urgently
prayed for at their headquarters. 59a Went-
worth Avenue, City. It’s near the Central
Station end of this philandering old town.
Sydney presswomen are using an unusual
weapon—the needle —this month. In off
moments they are sewing vigorously for
.Tack’s Day. Mrs. Fotheringhame is the
Quartermistress-General of the Needle Stall.
The Albert Goulds’ terraced garden at
Edgecliff was the green setting the other day
to trim a fete for Billjim’s comforts. The
Davidson lady, having declared that all was
well in Arcadv, w-hisked off to another en-
gagement. Toboggan slides gave ecstatic
bundles of muslin and lace threepen’orth of
joyous bumps, and sales were swift at
heavily-laden stalls. Profits go to the 4th and
56th Battalions and the Ist Machine-
gunners.
Two Tasmanians were married in the Fog
a few weeks ago. They were Captain Bill
Hinman, A.1.F., formerly of Launceston, and
Jean, daughter of Dr. G. H. Gibson, of
Hobart.
Matron Maude Russell, recently of the
Garrison Hospital, Victoria Barracks, is
rushing off to England for war duty. She
got the Royal Red Cross a few’ weeks ago
w’hen military decorations were handed out
by the Governor-General in Martin-place.
The Arts and Crafters will have their
annual show 7 in the Education Building's
gallery. It opens on October 29, and will
remain in that condition till November 9.
The new parasol is a dumpy 7 little affair,
wide and flat when open, and when shut up
rather like something you pull out of an
extra-size Christmas bon-bon.
Amongst this season's vagaries the exten-
sive draping and looping, like window-cur-
tains, of frocks is poticeable. Yet with all
the extra puff the %kirt grows narrower.
Francis Drake, who
sailed the Spanish
Main and kept the
wily Philip on toast,
; was represented at
the Elizabethan
pageant by merchant
T. H. Kelly, aider-
man and staunch
supporter of every
patriotic war fund.
He got into Eliza-
bethan garb for the
fete. To give in
money and service
(he was one of the
lion. secs, on Italy's
Day, by the way),
and to escape the
camera as much as
possible, is charac-
teristic of T. 11. Kelly. He is an amateur
musician (music runs in the family), and
the brilliant pianist F. S. Kelly (killed in
France) was a brother.
The objects of the Welfare Society, which
has been formally approved, are the better
supervision and care of infant life and the
better care of the mothers, the preservation
of the native-born and the prevention of
illness by the organisation of pre-natal care.
At the present time Australia is losing some-
thing like 33 babies a day. A great deal is
already being done, but the institutions en-
gaged in the work are working quite inde-
pendently of one another, and so losing the
necessary continuity of effort. What is
required is a sort of central information
bureau, where every man or woman inter-
ested in the child life of the State can get
the very latest data in its most convenient
form. To bring Sydney into line with, say
New York State, we shall require, first of.
all, to have the entire work for children and
mothers placed under one central control,
and this the Government has intimated its
intention of doing. One of the first jobs of
the Welfare Society will be to teach mother-
craft through the baby clinics and with the
assistance of a band of nursing aids who
will assist in the homes where a baby is ex-
pected or a child just born. Here they will
follow the visiting district nurse, and under
her instructions feed and attend to the
mother or any other little children in the
house and care for the newly-born baby. No
girl could render a more valuable service
to the Commonwealth. The society will
also embark upon a widespread publicity
campaign to show the citizens the vital
necessity of a personal interest and assist-
ance in the work. At the initial conference
of the society, J. D. Fitzgerald, M.L.C., said
that he intended' that it should not languish
for want of help, and that he had been for-
tunate in securing Mr. Innes-Noad to organ-
ise the work.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Melbourne, October 21, 1918.
Mv Dear Yarrie, —
The Caulfield Cup struck a windy Satur-
day, and sassiety was nearly blown out of
its new dresses by hot and cold blasts loaded
with grit. Big black-and-white checks were
almost uniform. A kilt of check with a
plain Scottish jacket is Fashion’s latest.
Hats were weird. The newest freaks are
a cart-wheel with a droop, or a small hat
in imitation of some Allied military head-
gear.
Mrs. George Woodforde, wife of the
V.A.T.C. secretary, rejoiced in the win of
their horse Carriole, and blazed a poppy-
red rosette in her big black hat. Mrs. Sam
Mackay braved the wind in snug navy blue
tailorings. Mrs. Lempriere swung a brilli-
ant blue cloak with a black ruff. Mrs.
Murdoch Anderson was tailored in dust-
color. Mrs. Everard Browne got into a
glace frock for a change from her usual
sporty tailor-mades. Daughter Gwen wore
a highly-colored coat, burnt-earth color, with
the new flare. Mrs. Rowe had daughter Mrs.
Richards with her from India. The young
matron was bonneted in black, Dolly Varden
fashion, with a bright blue lining. Mrs.
Macdonald scored her usual race frock sen-
sation. This time it was a red jersey effect.
Linda Byron Moore was a brown symphony.
Mrs. Sep Miller sailed under a bright cherry-
pink hat. Nesta Clarke wore the widest
black-and-white stripes available. Roma
Clarke advertised her millinery with a bril-
liant turban of silver and jade-green. Mayor-
ess-elect Cabena decorated the stand in blue.
Captain Symons, V.C., paraded his bride in
dove grey. Lesly Madden wore black, and
Mrs. Russell Clarke had yards and yards
of pleated black georgette.
The G.-G. and Lady Helen held a review
and inspection of the V.A.D.’s on Govern-
ment House lawns on Saturday afternoon.
Hundreds of the blue-grey girls, with snowy
head-dresses decorated with the Red Cross,
marched in fours and wheeled in eights,
while a khaki band blared from the shelter
of the shrubery. Several Anzacs helped in
the march with broad grins of amusement at
the way the girls evaded strict drill. The
Aids who marked time directly under the
eye of his Ex. nervously patted their hair
and kit with feminine anxiety. One broke
up the gravity of the reviewers by asking
the G.-G. what had won the Caulfield Cup.
He replied suitably. Lady Helen, in
blue, wore a toque wreathed with golden
grapes and vine-leaves. Her blue parasol
had a red jade handle and a big turquoise
pendant hung round her neck. The Stanley
lady, in champagne color from shoe-tip to
toque, had cunning black tassels on her hat.
Federal Government House last week had
a rainy garden-party, which had to be sud-
denly converted into an indoor reception
and around-the-dinner-table gathering, where
the guests had to be carefully adjusted.
Yon see, it would be dreadful if some of us
had to pass the salt to some of the others
of us who slip under the tent. Melba sang,
so that was one nerve-soother.
The Tasmanian Governor’s daughter has
been staying at Federal Government House.
Miss Newdigate is a bright-cheeked, cheery
girl who is engaged to a young man in the
Navy.
Mrs. Murdoch Anderson, of Cape Town,
is visiting Melbourne and appearing at race
meetings and Government House frivols. She
is a guest at the Alexandra Club.
Mrs. Pleasance, wife of the chemist who
was once Mayor of Melbourne, died with
tragic suddenness of influenza during the
week while with her daughter at her flat in
St. Kilda-road.
Henry Langley, incumbent of St. Mary’s,
Caulfield, has been elected a canon of St.
Paul’s Cathedral, and thereby follows very
closely in the sacred footsteps of his late
father, Bishop Henry Langley, of Bendigo.
The elder Henry, when canon of St. Mat-
thew’s, Prahran, was a well-liked, democratic
shepherd. Afterwards, he was in succession
Archdeacon of Gippsland and of Melbourne
and then Bishop of Bendigo until his death
a dozen years ago. When he passed over
brother John took up the bishing job in his
place and still holds it. The new canon is
a product of Trinity.
St. Cyr, the French military academy
which gave General Pau his grounding in
sc Idier-science, has a namesake at South
Yarra. It is a house in one of the suburb’s
more affluent streets, and was named by a
former French consul who lived there long
ago. Of recent years the place has been
occupied by a daughter of the late Collier
Christy. Miss Christy died last August,
leaving £60,000 —most of it, including the
fine old dwelling, to cousin Mildred Scott.
An association to combat the “social evil”
is very busy at present. Prof. Atkinson, Dr.
James Booth, Mrs. Robert Harper and John
T. Raw are prominent crusaders. They have
lectures at intervals. Barrister Woolf thun-
dered recently on Divorce Laws, and Mrs.
James Booth spoke up last Thursday.
A grateful mother paid her timely tribute
to the memory of a brave man when news
came through that the M.L. Marine Court
had reluctantly decided that the late Captain
Kell, of the Wiminera, had taken a risk he
should have avoided on .Tune 26, when a
German mine sunk his fine Ship. After
the explosion Kell and his men had only 20
minutes to do what they could, and amongst
the many they put on the way to safety was
Mrs. Hilda Croft, of Sydney, and her six
children. Writes Mrs. Croft: “It was
through his magnificent work that so few
lives (29 in all) were lost and so many of
the small children on board were saved.
Captain Kell and the second officer (Mr.
Wilson) saved my six children, and there is
not a more grateful woman living than I am
to-day. If ever there was a true British
sailor Captain Kell was one, and every right-
minded passenger will say the same. We
all owe our lives to his energy and self-
sacrifice, and we honor his memory.” That
should help to console the young wife poor
Kell was never to see again.
Lieut. L. McCub-
bin is now an advi-
sory artist in camou-
flage in the A.I.F.
When he is not busy
on camouflage work
he is an official
painter of war pic-
tures for the. Com-
monwealth Govern-
ment. This is an ex-
cellent portrait
sketch of the military
artist, painted by H.
B. Harrison, a Bana-
nalander now in Mel-
, bourne. The starred
sitter was in camp
at the time, and left
for France before the
finishing-off sittings
took place. McCubbin says France looks
to him like some parts of Australia, more
particularly where there are ripe yellow
crops of grain. He sketches the French land-
scapes with keen delight, finding it strongly
suggestive of the brilliantly-lit homeland.
He is also trying to get on to canvas the im-
pression of the awful and unceasing traffic
along the roads.
Anglican padre Frank Ingamells, who
lately came back to Australia after three
years’ service with the A.1.F., has been given
a steady job as vicar of Ores wick, the Vic-
torian mining town which produced the
Lindsay brethren.
The Education Department lost one of its
cleverest young teachers when Sapper Leslie
F. Sangster was killed in action on August
18, aged 21. He commenced his education
at the King-street State School, West Mel-
bourne, where he was dux at 13. At the
Teachers’ Training College and the Univer-
sity at 16, he gained the Diploma of Educa-
tion, _ and was appointed (at 19) to the
Hamilton High School, where he remained
12 months, and then enlisted. Sangster was
one of six Victorian teachers killed in action
during August.
Colonel W. Braithwaite and his wife, of
Preston, while holidaying in the West, were
saddened by cable news of the death in action
of their only son, Lieut. “Billy,” M.C., of
the 22nd Battalion. He won his decoration
at Bullecourt.
From Adelaide :—.
M. S. Hawker, whose home has been in England
for some years, is here on a brief visit. His wife
and family remained behind in the Cold Country.
Rev. G. Rayner’s son, Howard, has won the
Burney Yeo Scholarship at King’s College Hospital,
London, and has also received his commission as
sub-lieutenant in the Navy.
Another Stock Exchange member bound for the
Front, Q.M.S. Claxton, was farewelled by his
fellow-brokers on Wednesday.
Miss Julia Finniss died on Wednesday. She was
the second daughter of Boyle Travers Finniss, one
of our pioneer politicians and Acting-Governor in
1854-5.
A concert in the Town Hall brought in about
£BO for the Navy League Widows’ Fund on Thurs-
day. More windfalls from the sale of the Hackett
art collection have come to some of the funds—
£l2s each to the Trench Comforts and Red Triangle
Funds, and £5O to the French Red Cross.
Two spinning-wheels were installed at Keswuck a
few weeks ago, so that Billjim wounded could do
something towards providing socles for Billjim still
in the trenches. The men have proved so good and
keen at their work that more wheels are wanted —a
fact which the generous might note.
The projected Hostel for Soldiers’ Orphans at
Hahndorf is going ahead. It will provide accommo-
dation for about 50 children.
An Anzac Arch is to be built over the road that
leads from the railway station to King William-
road, and the first sod was turned by the Premier
on Thursday morning. It is to be made of con-
crete, 45ft. in height, and modelled after the Corin-
thian order of Grecian architecture. The Cheer-Up
Society is responsible for the idea and is footing
the bill.
Langdon Bonython, of Adelaide, has not given up
the dream of getting back the old family estate
ia Cornwall. The difficulty that has stood in his
way in the past was that about 60 years ago the
property was so tied up that it was impossible to
buy it. “But I will get it yet,” he says, “if the
British Government does not take permanent possession
oi the entire estate ; they have established a flying-
station on part of it.”
Helen Pamela Fullerton Armstrong is to
be christened regardless of expense as soon
as grandmother Melba returns from Sydney.
The event will take place at Lilydale, and
the Melba students will supply the musical
effects.
The committee of the Purple Cross
Society has been staggered by the following
blunt announcement, made With the authority
of the Repatriation Department: “It has been
decided not to permit any additional appeals
on behalf of the Purple Cross Society.”
With rare tact and delicacy the edict follows
closely upon the acceptance of a couple of
horse-ambulances by the Minister for De-
fence, who is understood to be personally
quite in agreement with the objects of the
P.C.S. General Monash’s wife is a vice-
president of the society, and its president is
Dr. Weigall, who as an Automobile Club
member has done so much to make returning
Billjim feel that his country appreciates his
sacrifices; and the rest of the names on the
list are also those of disinterested and gener-
ous citizens. The expense-rate has so far
reached only about 1 per cent, of its income,
and provides an admirable example of the
best war-finance; so it is hard for the com-
mittee to understand the Repatriation Depart-
ment’s ban. In future, apparently, it will be
necessary for those who have a kindly feeling
towards the Australian warhorse —the only
conscript in the forces —to sneak around to
the.. P. C. Society’s back entrance and slip
their contributions under the door.
Frances Woolcott, C.8.E., hon. organiser
and Government nominee of the Common-
wealth Button Fund, was congratulated by
the committee at its last meeting on re-
ceiving the Order of the Serbian Royal Red
Cross. The fund’s next appeal is booked for
October 25 in aid of the hospitals. Nurses
and returned soldiers are going to help.
The other day, in a fancy-dress parade for
patriotic funds, at Belmont (Vic.), a pair
of local residents turned out as a “Turkish
couple,” and won first prize! If there had
been a “Hun couple” present-presumably it
wculd have been a dead-heat.
Sideby is a photograph by the Sears’ Studios
of Captain-Commander Jose Montalva, of the
Chilian frigate Gen-
eral Banquedano,
which called in at
Melbourne for a
week on its way (via
Wellington, M.L.) to
Easter Island, thence
home to Talcahuano,
the naval port of
Chili. The Banque-
dano is a model little
man-o’-war that you
would like to pick
up and take home
for the children. It
carries midshipmen
in training, from the
age of 12, and the
youngest looks like
mother’s darling in
his party clothes.
There are 11 officers, all young and hand-
some, and with an easy use of English.
Montalva has just been decorated by the
Mikado of Japan, and the visiting Aus-
tralians wanted to decorate the ship’s cook
after tasting the ambrosia and nectar of
his Chilian dishes and wines. We have
learnt that the Chilians are famed epicures
and cooks.
Will Longstaff, cousin of John Long-staff,
is in France, acting as instructor in camou-
flage in the A.I.F.
Mrs. Hilda Rix Nicholas is busy getting
an exhibition ready. As most of her can-
vases would each occupy one wall, it’s rather
difficult to find a suitable gallery in Mel-
bourne. She has a great sense of color.
There’s an Australian girl running round
in a Ford for an American oil-refining co.
She is merely one of several in its Welfare
branch. A minor accident happens in the
works—say the casing-factory ; a man gets
his finger pinched. The first-aid dee-po for
him! There he has his injury dressed and
bandaged, and generally in half an hour he’s
back on his job. The risks of a septic
finger and a man off the job for a fortnight
are almost eliminated. If the man has to
stand off the outdoor nurse buzzes up in
her automobile. (They don’t have '‘cars” in
the U.S.A.) If a man is off the job the nurse
looks him up. If he ought to have medical
attention she orders it. If he is living in
surroundings that don’t help him to be a
good workman there’s a “blank” to be filled
in about it. This girl I told you of wrote
home a while ago to say that she had just
helped to get a poor girl’s father into a luna-
tic asylum. “The poor man ought to have
been there long ago. He used to roam about
the house at night and the family was terri-
fied of him. The girl was hardly ever able
to turn up to her work fresh.” There you
get the idea behind it all. And back of the
nurses is the safety engineer, who usually
manages the Welfare branch; his chief job
is to consider every accident and see if he
can’t suggest something that will prevent
another like it.
Stella Power has been wrestling with in-
fluenza for over a fortnight. It prevented
her from appearing at the final Chappell
Ballad concert in the Auditorium on Satur-
day night. Her place was taken by contralto
Dorothy Murdoch.
Handsome Lilias Adeson, who has built
up a reputation in Australian bush plays, is
a Toorak girl who, as Letitia Noseda (her
real name), spent several years amongst
amateur theatricals and elocutionary com-
petitions. Now, a much-travelled practi-
tioner, she knows Australia almost from end
to end.
C. ,T. Dennis and his wife continue to
enjov life at their humpy at Toolangi, in the
hills' The Sentimental Bloke is studying
birds, and has even got a lady bower-bird —
one of the shyest beauties of Australia —so
tame that she will feed out of his verandah.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
Spring racing at Randwick rang off with
City Tatt.’s meeting- on Saturday. It was a day
full of wild surprises for the crowd, and though
practically all the winners were fairly well backed
the fielders had a happy afternoon. Only one favorite
arrived to expectations—and in every race there was
something nearly red-hot. The Flying was one. Every-
one knew that Balarang couldn’t lose, and neaily
knocked the rest of the attendance fiat to get on.
Balarang had fist. 131 b. too, and such a certainty
did it look that with 15 starters it was 5 to 4 the
field, 7 to 1 bar one. But it didn’t come oft, and
several thousand thistle-eaters had further experience
on the painful subject of buying money. A practi-
cally unnoticed starter was Willie Ploma from New-
castle, where out of five starts lie had latterly regis-
tered five wins. Willie was at any old puce until
just before the curtain went up. At that stage an
unobtrusive but solid commission went hurriedly oil
at 100’s to 3 and 4, one fielder finishing up by laying
1000 to 80 in one hand. William landed the bacon
in good order and condition, lie was six horses back
at the turn, and coming on had Balarang smothered
at the last lialf-furlong. Newcastle has a habit of
periodically doing this sort of thing at Randwick.
Willie Ploma is a chestnut son of Merv, trained by
S. R. Johnston.

If the ex-Maoriland mare Bee is ever
going to win another race it looks as though some
different sort of company than Randwick supplies
will have to be chosen. Even then the handicappei
will have to be merciful. The little mare seems
sick and tired of the business —a circumstance that
is only natural, anyhow, for her legs have had a lot of
hard wear. Bee, now aged, is in her sixth racing-sea-
son, and so far as this writer can make out has been
58 times a starter. She appeared as a two-year-old
at Dunedin, J and at the age of three and tout
raced from, one end of Maoriland to tlie otnei at
all distances from 5 to 12 furlongs. Then she was
brought to Australia, ran in Sydney suburban handi-
caps and under w.f.a. at Randwick and Flemington,
was taken back to M.E. and raced some more, got
dragged to Australia again and was given additional
exercise at w.f.a. and in races like the Metrop.,
Melbourne and Caulfield Cups, besides others of less
consequence. In the course of all this hurry Bee
has won nine races —one of them in Australia. Yet
for this year’s Metrop. Bee was handicapped to be
better than Kennaquhair, Arch Marella and within
61b. of Poitrel. On Saturday at Randwick, Bee,
carrying Bst. 31b., got, through a bad start, a big
break on the field in City Tatt. s Handicap, 1-4-
mile. At 7 furlongs she was out four lengths from
Kenelic, who in turn was three in front of everything
else. Even then she couldn’t win. Bursar, giving
her 151 b. and a good ten lengths’ start at a mile,
easily ran her down. She is an honest quadruped,
but has all along been absurdly over-rated and badly
over-worked.
It was the first win that good horse Bursar had
registered since he took the Randwick Plate a couple
of seasons ago. He has been a hard horse to train.
Otherwise owner Trautwein would probably have
found him more profitable, for Bursar in undoubtedly
a top-hole galloper on his day and a natural stayer.
On Saturday he started in a very poor field at B’s.
After everything else had been run to a standstill
pursuing Bee he came easily away from the wreckage.
Among the starters in Bursar’s race were Dick
Meagher and Eastcourt. The Derby and other outings
in the previous week had left the colt very tired.
Perhaps that was the reason the crowd rushed to get
on at 5 to 2. Anyway lie never had a hope. But
he looked as if he ought to be having a holiday.
Eastcourt scrambled past a blown-out lot into third
place. This once very promising nag seems to have
become a pessimist. Possibly he spends his time
pondering on the reasons the local punter has for
backing him. . lie must have cost the clients of Mo
nearly as much as a war.
It is not always safe to conclude that a horse
which parts with its cargo in a steeplechase will do
the same next time. In the second ’chase at the
A.J.C. meeting Tararu Jack hit the ground early
in the proceedings. In the proceedings at Tatt.’s
meeting on Saturday he hit the front, and, jumping
like a stag, stayed there to the end. But some horses
fall regularly. Coominya seems to like doing it. On
Saturday Moon suddenly found that there was no
horse under him, and that he was standing on the
top of a fence.
Rosetree, the first of the Roseworthy family to race,
finished close up to the placed horses in the A.J.C.
Breeders’ Plate, and on Saturday at Randwick
carried 9st. to the front in a big field at Tatt.’s
meeting. Perhaps he had a bit of luck through
some of the others not having any, but he finished
well. This colt is in the Bursar stable, and if looks
go for anything ought to be heard of again. But
it seems a pity to notice him being made use of
so soon, for his looks are just those which would
go well with a holding-over policy. There are one or
two others of the same breed to be seen later on.
* * * *
The smallest Caulfield Cup field on record
might have been reduced to half a dozen for all
the chance that the rest of the starters possessed.
Eurobin, almost back in his top form, made the pace
one of the best. With only 7st. 121 b. to steady him,
Eurobin ran along as though nothing but the dis-
tance could stop him, and, with Hispania and
Wolaroi in attendance, the one-time Doncaster win-
ner had covered more than a mile before the dis-
tance did stop him. Wolaroi, the top-weight, ran a
great horse throughout. He was first round the
final •turn for home, and even when the inevitable
King Offa had pushed out of the ruck and caught
him at the distance post, or thereabouts, lie made a
gallant show. King Offa seemed to win fairly
easily, all the same. He had no luck in the race,
but as soon as a decent opening offered the favorite
was there. And this in spite of the strain, sprain
or whatever it was, that had brought his off fore-
leg under the doctor's care.
Eusebius, after cutting up badly behind Outlook
in the - Eclipse Stakes on the W ednesday, staggered
some people by shaping rather like a stayer in the
Caulfield Cup. His third was a most respectable
performance. But Eusebius never once looked a
likely winner, nor did he travel as fast as Ethiopian
in the last two furlongs. Indeed, but for the grave
doubt as to whether Ethiopian has not begun to stale
off, the English horse might be picked for one of
the Melbourne Cup probables. The prospect of the
Melbourne Cup going to one English horse or other
has never been brighter than this year, but at time
of writing the pea wants finding. Moreover, theie
are others, including Arch Marella.
-X- * * *
When the track watchers rushed into Mel-
bourne on Friday and announced that King Offa was
putting one of liis feet down very carefully and
only being taken for a stroll, there was something
like an earthquake. The nag had been backed down
to 2’s and oto 4. Every book in Australia, was full
on him. The next few hours was a story of suddenly
expanding odds and few takers, of sudden clamoring
after Wolaroi, Eusebius, Rael Locin, Ethiopian
and next morning a swift gathering in of the slack
by the l ingmen when they saw money beginning to
come for the favorite. From 3 to 1 and 7 to 2 on
the morning of the race he shortened to 5 to 2 on the
course—Wolaroi 6to 1 and 11 to 2. At Randwick it
was 3 to 1 the field. 4 to 1 Wolaroi when the books
began, but very soon there was nothing better against
the favorite than 7 to 4. King Offa had been heavily
backed in Sydney a couple of months ago, and as
the betting had been more or less paralysed most of
the hooks had a -mighty bad time. Not only did
the straight-out volume everywhere show a balance
on the wrong Side, but in doubles King Offa stands
coupled up with nearly everything worth while, and
particularly with himself.
The first yarn concerning the cause of the English
nag’s lameness was that he had “cast a shoe” the
next that there had been “a sprain in the suspensory
ligament.” He was kept walking about in the bird-
cage for a couple of hours before the race, and
though looking bright and hard enough, he clearly
was tender on the off foreleg. It all boiled down
to whether the leg would stand the journey, Brad-
fiehl reckoned it would —or hoped it would, which is
about the same thing. As the number of times a
lame leg has carried a horse to the front is consider-
able anyway, there was at least a probability to go
on. And it happened once more. Bullock had an
easy ride and landed one of the biggest betting coups
of recent years for the horse’s owners. King Offa was
lamer at the end than when he started. Bradfield
may not have an easy job during the next couple of
weeks. .
* . * * *
“Mujik” : The sudden collapse of Outlook
in the A.J.c’. Derby didn’t convince me that there
was no hope left of him doing better at Fleming-
ton anyway. The colt had run such a thumping
good mile at Rosehill that the Derby showing must
have been all wrong. And the way lie was ridden
still left it an open question Whether if ridden with
less determination to keep his mouth open to a
strong wind he might not go further. The win in
the Eclinse Stakes at Caulfield and the downing of
Wolaroi " last week leaves it less open. That race
was a mile and three furlongs, and even allowing for
AVolaroi getting a bad bump back the win cast
quite a lot of doubt on the Randwick performance
being conclusive. On the Rosehill effort and the
Caulfield performance I give Outlook a good chance
at Flemington. If he cannot get the distance and
beat Finmark he isn’t as good as the Eclipse Stakes
makes him look anyhow.
* * * *
“Trot”: On paper the best-handicapped
horse in the Melbourne Cup is Arch Marella (7st.
31b.)—that is if you look at the Metrop. In that
race, with Bst., hi?'second to Kennaquhair, Bst. 41b.,
was mighty creditable, for Ivenn. is no slouch and
Arch Marella had not too good a passage. Taken on
the Metrop. form he must be hard to beat. Taken
on Hawkesbury and Rosehill performances a week or
two before he ought to soon be out of the fray. You
can choose which you like, but if you take the
Metrop. don’t blame me if two miles is beyond
him. If you take the other and he wins—well
don’t blame me either, because the other is the surer
guide. Anyhow, if he can see two miles through as
well as he did the mile and a half Offa won’t need
to have, anything wrong with his leg on the journey.
Nor will he find racing against Kennaquhair over a
distance at a difference of 41b. quite the same as
doing a shorter journey with a stone and a half the
best of it from Wolaroi. Lingle seemed to be fairlv
in the picture, well weighted though he is, until
the Randwick Plate. In that race he carried his
Cup weight over the two miles, and. it didn’t look
good enough. In the Metrop., taking everything into
calculation, he put up an attractive performance.
But why shouldn’t Kennaquhair beat him again?
Estland and Prince Viridis would have been putting
up a great Cup trial at the end of the Randwick
Plate if the first mile had not been a crawl. If
either of these two, with 9st. and Bst. 121 b., can
win a Melbourne Cup—well, the rest will have
nothing to brag about. Taking the lot above Bst.
the horse I look at with most hopefulness to land
the bacon would be Desert Gold. If she starts and
omits to win the chances of something nobody was
thinking about turning up are not at all remote.
And in spite of all the usual cackle and mystery
the history of the race is a steady warning against
having a long ear and an eye looking high up the
list.
* * * *
Three of the “big” handicaps have been
run so far—the Epsom, Metrop. and Caulfield. Two
have been won by imported animals —Rebus and King
Offa. It is a coincidence that neither of these horses
raced at two years old, that, they each cost very little
(Clark and Robinson only parted with £2OO for
King Offa), and that each are by the same sire.
“Solo” : Talking about coincidences : There
are often strange freaks to be detected in the
sequence of numbers and letters incidental to starters
in successive races, and one was sticking out a yard
before the last race at Randwick last Saturday. Up
till that stage five races had been run, and of these
the winner of all but one had been No. 1 on the
book. The exception was No. 11. How interpret this
perplexinglv certain office for the last? Well, it was
simple to me. I added up the l’s —6. Then took
away the pair that didn’t count —4. No. 4 in the
Welter was Auberie —5 to 1. ’Omeandried. The only
possible risk in finding ’em this way is getting
tangled up by the wrong arithmetic. But once you
know how, it’s as easy as finding a loser.
The Mt. Gambier (S.A.) Racing Club
lias a memorial that is probably unique. There is
a pleasant local custom that the winner of the
Winter Steeplechase each year presents a shield, to
hang in the members’ room. In 1915 the race was
won by the brothers Alfred arid Edmund Dohle.
Both of them died on active service within the
following year, and the club has filled the vacant
space with a shield inscribed to their memory.
“.Jobber”: While an A.I.F. race meeting
was going on behind the lines yesterday an aeroplane
sprinted past in the atmosphere and the pilot dropped
a letter. Everybody thought it was a notice to get
off the premises into dugouts. But from it fluttered
a 10-franc note, pinned to a message, “Put this on
Whiskers in the Villers-Bretonneaux Handicap.” It
was the first bet I ever saw made from aloft, and
the first punter I ever noticed watching the finish
from the edge of a cloud.
Mt. Morgan (Q.) lately welcomed back
from France, after two years’ service, ex-champion
wrestler Bill Bishop. Though Bill happens to be
just on 07 —his discharge shows 45 —he still has
yearnings for a bout of the old game. Meantime he
guards a paper which says: “The G. 0.0., A.1.F.,
wishes Sapper Bishop to be informed that he much
appreciates the example of duty set by him to
younger men, and trusts that he will live long to
enjoy the honor he has deserved by volunteering for
service at his age, and by his actual service in
the field.” The old-youngster is uncle to the mighty
Canadian airman, Major W. A. Bishop. The Queens-
land climate is getting more frightful every season.
At Sydney last week two brothers —C. G.
and ,T. H. S. .Barnes, of Queensland —settled a differ-
ence of opinion by each attempting to slaughter the
greatest number out of 200 pigeons for a stake of
£250 a side. Fifty birds escaped the barrage.
C.G. headed the massacre (78 to 72), and then
heroically handed the stake to the Red Cross. On
the same day 29 shooters had a “ten-bird sweep,”
and 232 head of poultry were killed out of 290
which left the traps. Altogether 382 pigeons fell
that day to the guns of those who thirsted for easy
gore. Meanwhile—but never mind.
Frank Tarrant, formerly of Australia, but
nowadays practising the profession of cricketer in
India, came into the limelight at Paona the other day
in a most conspicuous hurry. Playing for the Mahara-
jah of Cooch Behar’s Eleven against Lord Willingdon’s
outfit he took all 10 wickets. The score was 219:
Tarrant’s average 10 for 90. Next day, with two
wickets to follow and the score only 90, it looked as
if the Maharajah was going to be badly walloped.
Tarrant, who had been n.o. with 29, went in, and
while the two last joints in the tail held their
wickets up he ran his tally to 182 and the team
score to 263. This is phenomenal sort of cricket.
Even in club matches the taking of all 10 wickets
in an innings and then scoring over a century off the
bat must be a very unusual circumstance.
* * * *
Sydney premiership cricket on Saturday
again brought some one-time rep. players into the
fresh air. Left-hander Warren Bardsley (Glebe)
banged together 114 against Middle Harbor; S. H.
Emery (Petersham), 108 (not out), against Western
Suburbs ; and M. A. Noble (Paddington), 71, against
Waverley. Behind the stumps C. J. Mclvew (Western
Suburbs) omitted to allow anything past. McKew,
Ma’s stumper in the 1913-11 Sheffield Shield matches,
was in the running for a permanent position in big
cricket when Wilhelm went mad and pushed the game
into the freezer.
* * * *
Bob Barbour (’Varsity), who notched the
first century (113), v. Goodna, in Brisbane cricket
this season, belongs to a family well known in Aus-
tralian athletics. A quarter-century ago, G. P. Bar-
hour, now of Toowoomba Grammar staff, piled up
big scores for ’Varsity and Burwood in Sydney
premiership cricket, and represented the State in
Union Rugby. Captain Eric Barbour (in France)
was one of the finest of N. S. Wales batsmen; and
Bob has a soundness in style which threatens to lift
him into rep. encounters. Both are high-class
tennis players. A few months ago Bob tripped to
Sydney and rushed off with the Singles Handicap at
the N. S. Wales tournament.
* * * *
The Adelaide left-hander Stirling had an
afternoon out at Lord’s ground, London, lately. It
was a cricket match between a very moderate team
of Australians and the Clergy, and the pitch was of
that peculiar English brand on which bowling merely
good is not good enough to win; it has to be sensa-
tional. The parsons made only 67 ; but even that
pace of getting them out had not been fast enough,
as a change of bowling was made in the innings.
And 67 was enough. The Australians made only 62,
and 13 of these were extras. (They gave away
16 extras themselves.) But the Clergy made only
50 at the second try, and Australia won by 9
wickets. Stirling’s share of' the bag was 6 for' 16,
and 5 for 12. “Cadet Gregory” accounted for
eight of the others. About the same time, Lord's
saw a really good Dominions XI in great trouble.
They went in against 157 made by Warner’s strong
English team, and were met at once by rain, which
ruined the pitch. From 5.45 till 7 p.m. they
scratched for runs. Macartney, Barbour and Park ail
amassed 0. Kelleway 7 and Moyes 10 were the
highest scorers. When stumps were drawn they had
lost 8 wickets for 34 ; and it was a one-day match
only.
* * * *
The wind-up of the football season in Vic-
toria saw a brawl between contending junior teams
and barrackers at Royal Park, and the discussion
only ended when the supply of blue-metal and pickets
was exhausted, with the casualties about a score. One
youth, aged 19, was rushed to the hospital with a
fractured skull, but died before he reached the insti-
tution.
* * * *
By winning Sydney Tennis Club singles
championship—which is equivalent to State honors—
Norman Peach established a claim to be labelled
the best local racquet-wieldcr in these dull days of
the pastime. In the final, Peach defeated R. Neil
(ex-Victorian first-rater) by 6-3, 6-2, 14-12 (one
of the longest tussles of big tennis for many years):
The brothers Norman and Frank Peach have been
busy in doubles events in Sydney for quite a long
while.

McManamey (North Sydney High School)
manipulated his legs in great style at the inter-area
senior cadet championships at Manly on Saturday.
He won the 440yds. and high jump (4ft. llin.), was
second in 100yds,, and was among the heat-winners
in the 220yds. Young James recently won the
100yds. and 220yds. senior championships of N. S.
Wales Combined High Schools; and is a top-notcher
at swimming, cricket and football.

Pro Bono Britannico : (1) That is charac-
teristic of the Department; (2) the gags are of no use.
. ...P.H. (Tas.) : Don’t know.... A Party of Aus-
tralian Soldiers in 3rd London General Hosoital • 'n.v
sent your letter to him... .Thos. Angus: Haven’t seen
them yet... .Kauri: May use 0ne.... J.G.W. (M.L.):
ft]ad to read anything you send ; but make your para-
graphs short. The Paper Controller is abroad... .Light
Horseman: Sorry, but not of sufficient interest....
N.G.: If the metre hadn’t wandered out of the pad-
dock and got lost in the bush and stuck in two or
three bogs and been trodden on by a tank—well,
there’s no knowing. Try it again... .A.R.P. Not up
by miles. Still you’re in good company; even
Time is never able to overtake itself....
W.T.: Not bad... .R.D.F.: Metre is faulty and
the idea is slight S.M.: You get no mirth
out of the William animal... .C.J.W.: Very
bad... .P.W.M.: N 0... .R.N.C.: We don't reprint;
and we wouldn’t reprint that except as a shocking
example D.P.M.: Horrible T. A.: N0....C.R.:
Verses have some merit; but the merit is of little
importance. In fact, merit is a drug on the market.
. ...R.H.: Doesn’t convince... .G.J.: Vei'y poor
attempts at mirth... .J.P.: No use A. 11.; Not
on the loop line even... .C.C.: The person who wants
to “smile when serpents sting” has our respect....
Q.M.J.: No good, unless you have a grandmother handy
you don’t want. Read it to her S.D.: Not enough in
it for us. (P.S. —Nor for anybody else) M.S.:
“Motherhood” and “Peace” are held over until after
the next war....5.L.: You haven’t the freedom of
manner to make the “Wee Folk” dance gaily or the
old folk weep convincingly; but the promise is there.
. ...R.D.: Insane poem thrown out of a high window.
If you listen carefully you’ll hear the thud W.J.:
Not up....W.W.: The postal poem falls short of the
high standard reached in “The Elixir of Life.” Con-
sider this passage:—■
To-day at last is realised
A project I have long idealised,
In which the postal servants of the State
May each and all henceforth participate.
I realise Australia’s future will demand
Improved and modern methods to withstand
The rivalry to follow on the war
In business undertakings near and far.
What you meant to say, presumably, was:—
To-day at last is realised
A project I have long idealised,
By which the postal servants to the door
Shall bring lost letters that we still deplore.
1 realise Australia will demand
Officials who will try to understand
That looking insolent and feeling tired
Are not the things especially desired,
And that the public, with a weighty. “Damn,”
Will one day see they send its telegram!
. ...N.8.J.: “Wattle” won’t d 0... .H.M.C.: Not
good enough for a shocking example Kemo:
That operation idea has been better worked fre-
quently before R.D.: Good of its kind. Try some-
where else. .. .R.H.: Rejected on sanitary grounds... .
G.T.D.: Not enough in “Night.” The similarity of
rhymes in the sestet is a fault G.F.8.: Doesn’t
go II.B.B.: Try again R.S.: Jim’s smile is
very doleful J.D.N.: Nothing in it F.H.: As
brilliant as a wheelbarrow that has been left over-
night in a heavy dew E. 5.8.: Half-cooked....
Angela K.: No u5e....G.8.: Sorry; can’t use....
S.S.M.: It falls over its feet; which is a bad habit.
. ...A.K.: Take it away. The scent has not exactly
the sweetness of boronia E.W.S.: Too many print-
worn tags.... J.C.T.: Verses won’t go—probably be-
cause they’re not verses. . .J.R.: The “Herbert River”
is a sorrowful stream of words M. 8.: No use....
C.R.A.: Brilliant telegraphic effort:—
Bulgaria (perverted from- the right
By fox-like Ferdinand)
Has crumbled ’neath onslaught of Allied might,
Long ere her capital appeared to sight;
Her forces will disband!
Unhappy land! She now has met the fate
She meant for Allied Pow’rs ;
Once more is heard the mournful cry, “Too late!”
But that with greatest pleasure we relate,
For this time ’tis not ours!
.. . .E.M.L.: Forbear! Look at your lines and see if
you can find anything that hasn’t been better said
before by the Poet Laureate F.H.: “Learn to
Write” has an idea concealed therein. Engage a
private detective... .O.B.: That puts the case for the
country against the town strikingly:—
For it’s back to the plough you,
And never get into a stew;
We keep the shears bright and new, vou,
For people can’t do without us few*
It’s us few that keeps the people at the cue,
Our shears we must keep well in temper;'
We keep the- Parsons at the Pew,
For they must never loose their temper.
For it’s work from early morn until sunset,
To keep the hungry ones in Town at bar;
We must keep our plough well set,
As we are forced now, only to obey.

You’re only moderately gloomy. Have another

“Bouragi” : So my old friend Oliver Bain-
bridge has been received by Lord Mayor
Joynton Smith, of Sydney, in state! I first
met 0.8. in Thirsty Island, some 20 years
ago, when he was talking of leading an expe-
dition up the Fly River (N.G.). Not long
after I met him in a Brisbane boarding-house,
where he was preparing a lecture which
was to prove a connection between the
natives of Kiwai Island, in the Gulf of
Papua, and the lost tribes of Israel. Oliver
tried bits of the lecture out on his fellow
boarders and finally presented them with
tickets for an entertainment which, in
addition to the lecture, included a recitation
of “The Prisoner of Chillon,” or something
like that. I did not attend, but some of my
friends did. They appeared to be disap-
pointed, but not so disappointed as the
lecturer.

THE AUSTRALIAN DEIED EEIJTTS ASSOCIATION (A.D.F.A.) realises that the Australian Public (through lack of information)
regards Dried Fruit (especially Sultanas, Currants and Leilas) as a Luxury instead of as a Necessity—a Food.
The A.D.F.A. is undertaking a big Publicity Campaign to bring their Eaisins (S., C. & L.) under the-direct notice of adults and children.
One of the first steps is to ADOPT A BRAND OR A NAME, by which the fruit will be known from one end of Australia to the other.
In California there is the “Sun-Maid Eaisin”-and the “Sunkist Orange.”
Some such striking and appropriate name is wanted for the
Superior Australian Sun-Dried Produds
—Attractive—Appetising —Clean—Luscious —Nourishing- Satisfying—produced in the Irrigation Districts of the Commonwealth.
To secure the best ideas obtainable, The A.D.F.A. Publicity Director offers prizes of £25, £lO, £5, £4, £3, £2, for the six best names suggested,
in the order of their merit.
Competitors must with tlieir entry send a 3/- Postal Note, for which a package of all three fruits will be sent by return mail POST FEEE —
i.e., the A.D.F.A. pays postage out of the 3/-. forwarded and supplies balance in fruit.
Or, alternatively, send a short letter or invoice from their local storekeeper to say they have that day bought at least lib. each of these fruits
(Sultanas, - Currants, Lexias), or 31b. of either. This letter must specify “A.D.F.A. Pack.”
Competitors will therefore be able to judge the merits of the fruit they are helping to popularise; and will provide a fine Xmas treat for
themselves.
Entries must reach Milclura by 30th NOYEMBEE, 1918.
Winners’ names will be widely advertised, and entries will be judged entirely on their merit.
The name needs to be short and attractive to the purchasing public.
All entries must be addressed to — C. J. DeGARIS,
DIRECTOR OF PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN,
A.D.F.A., MILDURA (Vic.).
Whose decision In the matter of the award shall be final and absolute.

Just Like New!
Dirty, gloomy, dust-catching furniture can
easily be restored to its original beauty and charm
with Johnson’s Prepared Wax. Has your mahog-
any furniture a bluish, cloudy appearance? An
application of
will quickly and permanently remove it —at the
same time imparting a hard, glasslike surface of
great beauty and durability. It protects the varnish
—adding years to its life and beauty; covers up
mars and small surface scratches. It cleans and
polishes in one operation.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax contains no oil
never gets soft or sticky in warm weather, conse-
quently does not gather dust or show finger prints.
Use it on your piano, gramophone, furniture,
floors and woodwork, linoleum and leather goods.
Use It On the Motor Car
When used on the motor car it preserves the finish
and protects it from the weather—prevents checking—
sheds water and dust and makes a wash last twice
as long.

“I Always Demand
It"
The housewife who is careful in what she buys
and how she spends her money-—yet who insists
on quality—always buys
IRELAND’S
Baking Powder.
She knows that mere cheapness in Baking Powder is poor Economy.
She asks for IRELAND'S BAKING POWDER because she has proved i % reliable.
Her cakes cook to a nicety—her pastry turns out crisp and more easily digested; her scones
are light as a feather always.
Ask the grocer to bring you a Tin. Give it a trial, and note the better results.
J. Ireland Ltd., Newcastle.
The old metals branch of the Victoria
I eague Trench Comforts Fund, which was
formed in West Aus. for the purpose of con-
verting old metals and waste materials into
comforts for the soldiers, has been very suc-
cessful. The school children were enlisted as
collectors, with the schools as receiving
depots. Odds and ends of all descriptions
are gathered in—old copper, brass, alumin-
ium lead, zinc, silver, tin, bottles, rubber,
newspapers, brown paper and bags. Old
gramophones, sewing-machines, arc-lamps,
motor-car parts, bike lamps, cast-non and
other such Hiiscclluncous articles not in use
have also been collected. Tins which once
contained jam, tobacco etc. are in great
demand, as also are “gloy bottles and ink
and medicine bottles. One result of this
organised crusade on the back yard, shed,
refuse bins and scrapheap is the starting ot
two or three new local industries. One firm
assured of a supply of gloy bottles estab-
lished a paste-factory. Another began ink-
making. and another is filling empty boot-
polish tins with a home-made floor polish.
Beer-bottle capsules even are not refused;
they are sold back to the brewers.
“Algy R.” : France is the most cosmopoli-
tan country in the world just now. There
are troops from all quarters of the globe,
and not the least interesting among them
are the 8.W.1.’s (British West Indians)-—-
dusky negroes from Jamaica —whose good
English accent and intelligence impress at
once. I shall never forget my first intro-
duction to these fellows. It was at Moascar
(Egypt), and I was quite new to soldiering.
They were guarding a big ordnance dump,
and I strolled over to one six-foot sentry,
and said, “Hello, Dark. What mob are you ?”
“Dark,” whom I afterwards discovered owned
a sugar plantation near Kingston, in musical
English, replied, “We are not a mob. sir; we
are an organised Jamaican unit.”
A Federal member with loose financial
ideas proposed that the next harvest—the
one Australia can’t get rid of owing to lack
of ships—should be paid for by the issue of
“wheat bonds” or “corn bonds’ with, the
food as security. The Acting Prime Minister
rejected the idea, but he might well have gone
further and told the member that he
was the last possibility in the way of an im-
perishable ass. The wheat is already-
pawned, along with everything else down to
the baby’s rattle, as security for the Federal
debt. Also as security for the Federal
note issue. Also for the State debt. Also
for the Local Government debt, if any. Also,
in many cases, to the mortgagee and the store-
keeper or maybe to the landlord. To put
another bond on top of it would be piling a
wild cat on top of six or seven existing liabili-
ties, which is too much.
Morris Fielding, lately attached to a
tary Cross, is an old boy of The King’s
School, Parramatta (N.S.W.), and went, to
Oxford on one of the school’s travelling
scholarships six years ago. When Bill
broke into Belgium, Fielding had still a year
of his course to do, but he dropped his books
and grabbed a rifle with an English regi-
ment. He didn’t lose his degree, for Ox-
ford reckoned he was doing more good in
Flanders than in the lecture-rooms, and
gave him his B.A. He now wears three
stars and two wound stripes. Father is
S. G. Fielding, Anglican rector of Padding-
ton (Sydney), who served his time at sea
before taking his sky-pilot’s certificate.
The genius at the London end of the press
cable lately notified a staggered public that
“the Americans at St. Mihiel captured Pro-
fessor Otto Schwerenkatz, the inventor of
chlorine gas.” He must be two or three cen-
turies old, too.
“T. 0.1.” : Apropos the Stewart monument
at Mount Pleasant, near Bathurst, N.S.W.
(B. 26/9/’18). The following is the in-
scription on the obelisk :
Erected to the memory of Major-General William
Stewart, late Colonel of H.M.’s 3rd Regiment (or
“Buffs”), and first proprietor of this estate, who died
on the Bth of April, 1854, at the advanced age of
85 years. He embraced the profession of arms on
the 10th March, 1794, in the 101st. Regiment, and
subsequently- entering H.M.’s 3rd Regiment of Foot,
served for upwards of 34 years with that corps in
the East and West Indies, in the Peninsular War and
in North America. He bore a distinguished part in
the principal assaults and successful seizures of
Grenada and some of the West Indian Isles, and
commanded corps in the general actions of Albuhera
and Busaco. In the colony of N. S. Wales he offici-
ated both as Lieutenant-Governor and Governor, and
through all his varied services, prosecuted as they
had been in every quarter of the globe, whether of
a civil or military character, he exhibited and faith-
fully sustained the courage and devotedness of a
zealous public servant. In private life he was
highly esteemed as a useful and honorable member
of society-. He invariably proved himself a ready-
friend of the poor; and when, like a shock of corn
fully ripe and in lively faith in the efficacy of our
Blessed Saviour’s atonement, he departed this life
he was universally and deservedly regretted.
This Obelisk
has been raised as a filial token of affectionate
remembrance by- his surviving children.
Arise and depart, for this is not your rest.
“E.R.T.” (from France) : Just left us for
his Bananaland farm, Thomas Gilvears,
whose record deserves a high place in Aus-
tralia’s honor list. The father of 10, he
gave six sous to the A.1.F., and then butted
in himself. Three of the family rest in that
part of France w’hich will always be Austra-
lian. Another is now in a London hospital.
Two, both of whom have already been
wounded, are carrying on. There ought to
be a family V.C.
Walter Gooch, dead in Adelaide at close
on 76, was one of S.A.’s oldest native-born.

“Arthur R.” : Despite “Murkah's” figures
(B. 3/10/’IS) re telegraphist’s cramp. I still
maintain that the cramp is primarily caused
by the excessive mental strain endured whilst
sending, and my contention is upheld by
leading American authorities who have made
a special study of the disease. When operat-
ing at a high speed, either sending or receiv-
ing, the breathing of the telegraphist is in-
terfered with, the action of the heart is in-
creased, and there is a rush of blood to the
head, all tending to increase the nerve ten-
sion. In the majority of cases the muscular
fatigue is only a secondary matter, and
merely requires rest for its relief. To reduce
the strain of . operating, an Adelaide tele-
graphist recently invented a machine that
makes both the dots and the dashes by a
pressure either to the right or left.

Miss DUDLEY LINDSAY (from a photo).
Beauty
and
Rexona.
Dear Sirs, —I am sending
you my photograph, as 1
want to join your Rexona
girls, for I consider that I
am truly one. I have heen
using your Rexona and Rex-
ona Soap now for over a
year, and consider them both
excellent. I have found
Rexona most healing and a
wonderful skin remedy.
Rexona Soap is certainly
quite unsurpassed as a
Toilet and Medicated Soap.
I think it is simply delight-
ful, and would never con-
sider ever using any other
kind again. I am also en-
closing three Rexona Wrap-
ners, which I have taken
from the soap, and wish you
would please send me one of
your Rubble Pipes, which )
notice you advertise to give
with each three wrappers
from Rexona Soap posted to
you.
I hear that Rexona is
now the most used of any
soap in Australia, and I am
sure it deserves to be.
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) DUDLEY LINDSAY,
Jamison Town, Penrith.
Gives Natural Beauty to SKin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot he imitated can he obtained
by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert
this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, wlich tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps caji only cleanse; they
cannot heal and protect the skin. Rexona Soap contaius the same soothing, healing,
antiseptic balsams as Rexona the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment
of skin affections is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and facial
Soap regularly once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse
the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples, and leave the complexion clear, fresh and
velvety. Price 1/- per tablet.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHAT wealth beneath our flag is swept!
What spicy things does victory
weld!
Old walls, old tragedies that kept
High walls that loveliness has held,
In ancient nights of wine and song
Where the Barada sweeps along !
Slim minarets that search for stars,
Round domes that catch the wild moon’s
white,
A golden crescent, and the bars
Of torches driving back the night:
Old legends not unbathed in blood* —
Dried rose-leaves of a poet’s mood.
Green gardens, pricked by slender towers,
Dim mosques that whisper of the dead,
And everywhere a tale'of flowers
To mock the dust of years instead
With red renewing of old sin,
Hot hates, harsh loves —of Bedouin !
A caravan that leaves the gate
Asway with bales of silk and wool:
And lurches up the “street called Straight”
To where the summer makes a pool
Of rotting weed and stagnant gleam
Where once there raced a silver stream.
What waving palms of swelling date,
What rough-leaved tig with grape-vines blent,
And shadowing the eastern gate
A grey and ruined battlement,
Above where stride, from near and far,
The chatterers to the long bazaar.
Streaked blades of tine Damascus steel
Flick invitation on the gloom,
Until —almost ghost fingers feel
From out some bold and noble tomb,
Where lurks, impatiently, within
The spirit of a Saladin!
Gold serpents, rich in filigree
Over the Persian carpets crawl;
With dull blue robe below his knee,
Grown fierce about a cashmere shawl,
Swart Egypt argues price—and worth —
To please the fairest maid on earth !
The whiff of Mocha coffee comes
From carven lattice of a screen,
And out beyond the mud-walled homes
There lie great orchards, moist and green,
And out beyond their groves again
The blue immensities of plain.
And here the Holy Pilgrim goes,
With dreams of Mecca in his eyes,
He feels no thorn —he heeds no rose—
Whose thoughts are all of Paradise,
For, smooth and green, for faith to see
Mahomet spread the canopy!
And in its golden casket set
To wait the New Crusaders, led
To victory, there watches yet
Saint John the Baptist’s severed head
Where the Great Mosque below the street
Still holds the sound of Jesu’s feet!
What echoes of the Saracen
Still murmur through the wrinkled town.
What clatterings of armored men,
What women’s dark eyes peering down
Through crevices in walls austere
To read what lust has written here,
What wealth beneath our flag is swept
Of archives —not unsplashed by blood—-
Old walls, old bitter trysts have kept
Dried rose-leaves of romance’s mood,
What antiphones of battle song
Where deep Barada sweeps along!

M. FORREST.
An Evening at Home.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUR dining-room was being brought up
to mother’s notions of Art. Where
once we lounged on imitation-leather
we were now to poise upon injitation Marie
Antoinette. The pictures of cattle had been
improved out of all semblance to live stock
by our home impressionist, who works errati-
cally in enamel. The same genius had con-
verted the mildewed mirrors into objets
d’Art by the agency of glue and gum-leaves.
The whole thing was to be a sanctuary,
raised to Refinement, and now but awaited
the crowning ceremony—the laying of the
lino; new, this, and imitative, of parquetry.
Father is the High Priest.
Says he, as the clock reaches 10.30 p.m.:
“What say, if I just put this down?” His
hand lay authoritatively upon the Voll of
floor-covering.
“Too late,” demurs mother.
“Notatall,” answers the High Priest.
“Nothing in laying lino but common-sense.
Have it down in a jiff.” He genially pinches
mother’s ear. The caress awakens no answer-
ing warmth in her. Coldly she suppliesdrim
with the tools of trade and settles to the
ordeal.
Father seizes the roll and cuts the string.
It is just what the stuff has been waiting for.
It springs apart, trebles its bulk, and, with
a hollow reverberation, leaps upon father and
floors him. But he does not lose his joviality.
No.. Being down, he opens out his opponent
a little and makes a profound study of its
intricate design.
“I see,” he says. “There’s a system in this
parquetry; but I’ve mastered it—l’ve mas-
tered it. See here! We’ve got to get these
half-squares into diamonds. The things
easy. We measure from here to here, cut
through these diamonds, and pass over the
ovals. Then we lay the two pieces and get
an even square from there to there. See!”
“No, Alfred, I can’t say that I do. It
looks to me, if we cut from there to there
and then join, we’ll get those crosses on one
side and diamonds on the other. But there’s
really no need for calculations. The sales-
man said: ‘Cut it in 12ft. lengths, and it
must, match-—couldn’t help matching.’ He
said it is printed to match.”
The obstinate line round father’s lips hard-
ened, warning the reckless woman to be care-
ful. Still she babbled on: “The salesman
said” . , ,
"Salesman’s either a liar or a tool; or he s
one and you’re the other, Susan. He had
some axe to grind, depend on it.” Father s
distrust of all humanity amounts to a dis-
ease. “And did he mention that by cutting
into" 12-foots and matching the pattern, one
piece’ll be leaning up against the wall and
the other have a shortage?”
Mum shakes her head. “The salesman
said”
“Whereas if you make a good job oi it
against the wall you don’t make a match
along the join? Did he tell you that? Why
didn't your learned friend the salesman ad-
vise you to take a few feet extra for wastage,
blunders in your measurements, and all that
—eh?”
Unanswerable argument. Mum is worsted.
In surly triumph, after working out sums
and solving arithmetical riddles, . the boss
makes diagrams upon the parquetry. “A cut
here and a cut there will result in a diamond
on one side and a ruby—oh, dash it! —a
rectangle on the other; whereas what we
want is a perfect square here and a circle
here.”
With pride in liis logic he awaits concur-
rence.
“H’m yes? But what is a rectangle, dear?
Perhaps "if you would point out a rectangle I
could understand better.”
“Gracious heavens! Weren’t those simple
problems explained to you at school?”
“Not that I remember, Alfred; but the
salesman’s explanation was that cut into six-
foot lengths”
“It was 12-foots before,” he interrupts
bitterly. “But, of course, if you want the
lino cut into pocket-handkerchief allotments,
why not say so at the start? I’ll withdraw,
and you and yoqr salesman can chase your
squares and diamonds into Turkey for me!”
“Oh, now, dear, if you’re going to lose
your temper”
“Temper! Temper! Who’s losing their
temper? It’s you, trying to confuse me.
Here, give me the chalk and the twine.”
Laboriously chalking the string, he
crouches, and with exasperating thorough-
ness holds it taut and plays upon it some
melody with his free fingers. When a fine
white line is discernible from that diamond
to this oval he makes incomprehensible move-
ments with the measure; makes white dots
and loses them; takes counts and misses the
tally, and mutters always, though whether
a blighting commentary on wives’or an incan-
tation to the god of floor-coverings he alone
knows.
His wife watches the workings of this
gigantic male intelligence with the indiffer-
ence of a stoic. Art, she realises, must be
bought with suffering. Had she been con-
tent with the old floor-covering—a simple
green with a sprig of yellow—she would by
now be courting sleep. As it is, she is court-
ing rheumatism.
“Now, then, Susan!” (She comes to
attention.) “Listen to these instructions.
Twelve-foot-four —cut twelve foot west of
star. Cut diamond —cut square, three inches
—hold on, where am I? —cut square, three
inches—thre-ee inches —mark scoring line—
cut across star line —eh, eh? —eight inches.”
He fumbles with the tape. “Where’s
eight on this infernal thing?”
“You’ve got it, Alfred. That’s eight
you’re looking at.”
“Ah! I took it for a three. That
throws me all out. Mus’ go back. Where
was .1, now? Measure twelve-feet-four west
of diamond”
“Are you still working at the lino, dear-
est? Or are you trying to locate buried
treasure —because I might bring in the
spade!”
He heeds her not. “Thing is,” he muses,
“if I cut from here to here and get good by
the wall, what do I get on the join?” He
gazes so intently at his work in search of the
answer that the parquetry plays tricks with
his vision. Oblongs and diamonds dance a
minuet; ovals and squares, stealthily
shuffling about, seem to threaten him. His
partner puts in a plea for bed ; but he is no
believer in eight hours for wives. “No use
deferring difficulties,” he says. “Got to be
done.” Then, after a pause: “Like a
woman. First hint o’ trouble, turn tail,
whimpering.”
At this she does whimper. Opposite
him she crouches upon the dancing fig-
ures of her parquetry and wishes she had
never seen it, or him, or the light of day.
Yet dutifully she stoops upon calves that
quake, for it is many a year since she played
leap-frog, and her muscles are stiff.
The clock strikes eleven.
Comes now daughter Doreen, home from an
evening at the movies with father’s future
son-in-law. Doreen huddles down beside her
mother, takes in her reddened eyelids and
father’s obstinacy. Joy in her own future is
momentarily dashed.
“Harold suggests a trip to the lakes,” she
whispers; “but I don’t know”
“Why not, dearie? You’ll have plenty of
time.”
“Time? What do you mean, ma? Of
course, I’ll have time. I’m talking of a
trip, you know —honeymoon, the lakes.”
“Oh. of course, pet. I thought you meant
now, before we get the lino down —before
... .we get... .to bed.” Her eyes refill.
“Leave him, ma,” hisses the bride-to-be,
passionately. “Leave him ! Come to Harold
and me. It would be a rest for you. I would
let you do up Harold’s shirts and”— —-
A jubilate from the worker arrests further'
confidences. He points to hieroglyphics.
“Got it, Susan! Got it, by Jove. But we
were fools not to have seen it before. Came
to me in a flash —just like that” —and he
waves a hand. “Now, then, old girl, just
look here.” (He wags a finwr.) “By cut-
ting from the other end to here—mark N—
turn the half round, upend it, mark to
(-) and cut, we get diamonds —hold on, what
you got there?” He indicates her end of the
lino.
“Cramps, Alfred,” she answers with seem-
ing irrelevance. “Oh, I beg pardon, dearest;
you’re still thinking of the design, while I
was thinking of a nightmare I had during
our honeymoon in which I was crawling
through a gaspipe and woke up with
cramps.”

Watchfulness can add years
to anybody’s life. Some are
old at sixty, others are young
at eighty.
Your habits mean sound
kidneys or weak kidneys—
good blood or bad blood, for
weak kidneys let uric acid
collect in the blood to ruin
health.
Always keep the kidneys
active, but especially after
middle age. This is good in-
surance against nervous, rheu-
matic and urinary troubles,
stiff and swollen joints.
Rest the kidneys by avoid-
ing overwork, worry and
strong drinks. And at the
first sign of backache, rheu-
matic pain or urinary disorders
use Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills.
What Sydney thinks of
Doan’s Pills is shown by grate-
ful tribute like the one given
here.
BACKACHE AND KIDNETt TROUBLE
CURED.
SYDNEY MAN SPEAKS.
Mr. H. Holder, Euronga, Amhurst
Street, North Sydney, says: “Doans ,
Backache Kidney Pills are indeed a won-
derful kidney medicine. I have proved
this. For a long time I suffered agony
from backache and kidney trouble, and
only those who have been afflicted in this
way have any idea what I went through.
Mv limbs swelled considerably, the kidney
secretions were thick and cloudy, with a
red sediment, and I had agonising pains
in my back. When I stooped it was as
much as I could do to stand up straight
again without assistance, my back was so
stiff and lame. I was treated by a doctor
and tried all sorts of remedies, but
nothing gave me the slightest relief. I
was naturally very worried about the
serious state of my health, and when
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were
brought under my notice I decided to try
them. It was a grand thing for me that
I got this remedy, for seven bottles cured
me completely. I cannot speak too highly
of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
recommend them with every confidence to
other sufferers.”
Two years later Mr. Holder says: “I
have still the same good opinion of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. They cured me
of kidney disorder two years ago, and I
have had no return of the complaint
since.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
sold by all Chemists and Stores at
2/9 per bottle, or posted by
Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt
Street, Sydney.
DOAN’S
Backache Kidney Pills
CURES BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
ITCHING PILES.
Mr. James Higgins, 21 Terry Street.
Surry Hills. Sydney, says: “Some years
ago I suffered a lot from Itching Piles,
the irritation being very trying, particu-
larly so at night and during the hot
weather. A friend advised me to try
Doan’s Ointment, and, knowing how
good Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
were, I got a pot at once, and it
proved a blessing. After a few applica-
tions I got relief, and, as I continued
with the remedy, the improvement was
maintained, until finally the piles com-
pletely disappeared. Five years have
elapsed since I used Doan’s Ointment, and
I have had no return of the ailment all
that time. I cannot speak too highly of
Doan’s Ointment, and recommend it to
other sufferers.”
Four years later Mr. Higgins says : “I
am still free from the torture of piles, and
have been since Doan’s Ointment cured
me nine years ago.”
ECZEMA.
Mrs. J. Thompson, 3 Onslow Street,
Granville, says: “For a long time I was
tortured with eczema. The irritation of
this ailment is dreadful, the days are
miserable and the nights sleepless. I tried
all sorts of remedies; but nothing did me
any good. I consulted a doctor, and his
treatment also failed to benefit me. At
last my son induced me to get a pot of
Doan’s Ointment, having heard this
remedy very well spoken of. After the
first few applications I noticed an im-
provement, so I continued with the treat-
ment until I was quite cured, using in all
two pots. Doan’s Ointment is wonderful,
and I never miss an opportunity of prais-
ing it. Eczema is a terrible complaint,
and other sufferers will be pleased to
know of a sure cure.”
Six years later Mrs. Thompson says : “I
am pleased to say I have had no sign of
eczema since Doan's Ointment cured me
six years ago.”

"Susan! Have you no sense of fitness?
Here in I working hard and you maundering
on about honeymoons !' At your age—bah!
Here, don’t crunch the chalk! There now,
you’ve rubbed out me line with your skirt!
T knew you’d do it. Oh, damn it all, can’t
you see the scored line ? We’re going to crack
the lino right on that and then lay half!’’
Ding, ding, dong. The clock strikes mid-
night.
Quietly the door opens. The prodigal son
stands there with famished eyes intent on a
snack of calf from the sideboard. His liquor-
dulled brain reeks not of father—hidden
menace ! But he scents danger in tile urgency
of mother’s warning gestures, and turns
empty away. He gains the sanctuary of his
room above by the rake’s causeway—-a series
of footholds, carved by his own knife in the
limestone facings of the old home, for such
emergencies as these. Bar a public home-
coming through the dining-hall there is no
other inlet for prodigals, for father has long
since commandeered all keys and sealed up
tor ever the dark side-hall doorway, with its
natural advantages for the arrival of rakes
and lovers. And so. through this Kaiserian
action of father, are his heirs perforce
stealthy, secret in their dealings, shunning
the light of living rooms.
Now the submerged begins to struggle, and
mother drags him from the undertow. To-
gether they sound the lino regarding the
scored line. It is recalcitrant and as stub-
born as a mule. It will boggle and balloon ;
will rise in hillocks; will sag into bays,
but crack in the Scored line it will not. They
lose their heads and their tempers; finally
they lose the line. While they are trying to
re-establish its identity, the parquetry acts
independently and breaks in quite a different
place-—several places, in fact. The workers
lay violent feet upon it and kick and trample
it.
Bull of savage exultation in their revenges,
I hey do not hear the clock strike one. Nor
do they hear muffled sounds in the room over-
head, where Juliet—youngest and most beau-
tiful is. supposedly, sleeping. Deaf are
Ihev to the weird night-sounds without; deaf
to the scrape of a tin hatbox in transit
above; deaf to the subtle and stealthy creep-
uigs of a cloaked and muffled figure upon the
stairs ; to the thud of a boot, dropped from
numb fingers. Deaf to all this, and blind
withal to a wistful rain-sodden face which
presses upon the pane from without.
Romeo’s face it is! Romeo, forbidden
Juliet and the premises.. . .
Down the stair pads desperate Juliet,
softly—stooping to spy through the keyhole,
l ather has just taken a header into another
piece of the parquetry. “Selfish beasts!” she
snaps. “Brutes! Pools! Monopolising the
house at this hour with their rotten old lino!
As if it mattered what they had on the floor
at their age ! And my poor darling out in
the wet since twelve o’clock !”
A movement of father doorwards sends
tier flying aloft again. She leans from her
bower, intending to whisper encouragement
to Romeo, but, encumbered with the hatbox,
she finds this difficult. He, poor sacrifice,
his nose pressed to the window-pane below, is
suddenly struck by the first instalment of the
trousseau. With a yelp of pain he disap-
pears. The shrubbery takes him in its
embrace: the hatbox scuds before the wind
to oblivion.
But he has a valiant soul and he returns
to. attack the side door on Juliet’s behalf
with a flimsy file which that resourceful
creature has slid beneath it. Crouched
within she welcomes the rasping that brings
her nearer liberty.
But now the prodigal appears in a blaze
of_ light upon the landing above, leading his
faithful bottle by the neck, his electric torch
stuck in liis hatband. With drink-distorted
vision he sees Juliet shrinking behind the
umbrellas, and with drink-spaked intelligence
confounds her with “Captive Kitty and the
Crafty Crooks,” whose misfortunes he has
followed throbgli a series of melodramatic
"movies.
What sound is that, mingling with wind
and weather, with tlmnderings from the
dining-hall? The prodigal shivers in his
soul. He waits for no more. Turning, he
leaps outward; and the Providence that
watches over drunken men sees that he
bounces on Romeo.
There he and the drunken one wrestle and
blunder, lunging dangerously near the win-
dow of that room where father and mother
are snarling. Thither dashes Juliet for help,
for confession, for anything that will save
her Romeo, when—crash ! The combatants
fall into the room, and father’s language
sets fire to the lino and the proceedings
generally.

Snakes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS awakened by Ivarl striking a
match. “Someding’s movin’ here.” he
said.
He started to get out of bed ; but changed
, . . , X rr t AA,
his mind. O Gott. \od 11 I do. Gott
in himmel! Here’s more on the floor!” I
rubbed my eyes and took stock of him. Had
he gone mad?
lie was peeping over the blankets, whis-
paring the while some awesome German
words. Beads of perspiration stood on his
face. His eyes were bulging and his hair
~, , ,
was perpendicular. Suddenly he kicked the
blankets high in the air. With them went a
long black streak, which hit all the furniture
with a thud and then slithered on to Pat’s
bed. Pat snored on uproariously. Karl
began to cab: I ad. Pad: ake up! Pad!
Yakc up! Doanned pump!”
“Plnvgt?”
“Boanned yump oudt!”
■‘Phwat in hell's name ! ud I be jumpin'
for?” .
""Yell, doanned ged oudt er bet!”
“Nadeless bit av advice that! Is it the
jim-jams you’ve got?”
"Blitz! No yim-yams! Here's a snake
somewhere on your bet!”
Pat was in a sitting posture in an instant.
So was the snake. It sat on its tail. It was
a red and black horror with beady, jet-black,
spell-casting eyes. Each rime it hissed Pat
held his breath and waited for the death
stroke.
At last he found his voice: “Howly
saints! I'm spaichless wid dhread !”
“Doaned ged oudt! Here is more of dem !
Oh, himmel! Here is tousands in der place!”
"Lorrd above! Have'we been transported
to the snake-house! What’ll I do, Karrul?”
"Kig him off gently mid your feed!”
Pat was too excited to kick gently. He
lashed out with all his force and the snake
struck the ceiling, the door, the floor, two
bedposts and the window, and rebounded via
Karl on to the lighted candle. The light
was immediately extinguished and the
candlestick motored furiously around the
dark room, while the burnt snake and his
relations swore like three dozen soda siphons,
My bed being conveniently situated near
the window, 1 pushed up the sash, threw my
dungarees out, and swarmed through after
them. Pat and Karl, amid snakes and darK-
ness, yelled a mad duet,
"Strike a lide /” "Mat elms “ Dam yez
oil! Are yez going to lave us to be devoured
be serpents an’ adders?”
After fumbling for some time in my pants,
which 1 was trying to put on upside down,
I found some matches and held a light
through the window. The only articles of
his clothing that Pat could safely reach were
his boots. These he grabbed and. seeing
one patch of floor not covered by venomous
reptiles, he leaped for it. He landed safely,
got the door open, and fled along the hall.
Karl's retreat was hopelessly cut off. But
relief arrived unexpectedly in the shape of
a leather-necked, shabby-genteel indi-
vidual with a long, neglected beard cofftain-
in S grass-seeds.
“Don’t be afraid, Mister,” he drawled,
“Don’t be afraid—it’s all right!”
“Mein Gott! Is id? Vy you leef your tam
snake iri our room?”
“I didn’t leave them, Mr. Deuteher! I
save my luggage to the groom ; and then I
S ot a bit elevated. He must have put the

talking he was calmly seizing his live-stock
by the neek antl dropping them one by one
into a sack - The last to be collected, a
mon strous black snake, lie held up in front
of the shivering Karl. “Fine creature that!
Well trained! Magnificent! He bites rab-
,”ts brou ght me by some of my audience.
The rabbits only live about a minute after.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A VESSEL for the amber wine of life
Is my warm body. Sun. moon, and
stars are pressed
Into the vintage. Love and bate and strife,
Passionate hurryings, and blessed rest
Spill in rich fragrance o’er the flowing brim.
A poppy dancing in the sea-flung wind
Heeds little of the Reaper’s drawing nigli.
“He comes,” she says, “the fruitful grain to
bind,”
And flings a crimson challenge to the sky,
As the swift sickle gleans her in its sweep.
Oh, joyous hours beneath the noonday sun!
Oh. hours of dappled shade! Oh, twilight
grey!
So swift, so soon, my little day is run.
So early drops the curtain on the play
Of men and women in the world I loved.
Oh, daydreams of adventure yet to be!
Oh, fair romance that beats in roseleaf
rain,
Round turret stair, and high grey balcony
Of that proud castle in the heart of Spain
Where eager feet of mine shall never fare!
This good red blood that stains my cheek and
runs
Pulsing within the column of my throat,
Death’s frost shall still despite the warming
suns
Of Spring and Summer, and the wild
bird’s note
Shall wake my greenwood heart no more to
song.
“A month, or maybe two—not more,” he
said.
That grave-voiced man with fingers skilled
and cool—
Those fingers skilled and cool. The swift
blood fled
Beneath their touch as if a mountain pool
Had closed its chilly depths about my heart.
Tn two short months, he said, I shall be
dead.

The Last Word in Concentrating Tables,
MODEL E BALL-BEARING CARD.
PATENT APPLIED FOR.
It has been long recognised and admitted that the Card Concentrator as a
mineral saver is unrivalled. The only objection urged against it is the trouble caused by breakage of the
supporting springs. By the invention of adapting ball-bearings this objection has been entirely overcome, ai d
without interference with any of the special features of the Card. Moving on these ball-bearings the Tai le
runs with perfect smoothness, and can be elevated as easily as preceding models. The new Ball-bearings can
be fitted to existing Card Tables by removing the springs.
