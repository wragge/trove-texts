SAINT I! OCHRIST IS REST
CHRISTINA ROSSETTI’S verses are
now accessible to economists in a
“ Golden Treasury ” selection at
2s. (id. net (3s. 3d. posted from our Ad-
vertiser). Not to ’know them is not to know
the work of the best woman poet in English.
They divide themselves naturally into
three moods, corresponding with three life-
epochs—girlhood unawakened, young woman-
hood passionate with a dream of love soon
relinquished, a middle life and age of
thwarted instinct vainly seeking consolation
in religion.
d*
The early verse is natural, limpid, bright :
with a thought sparkling into spontaneous
images. In “ Goblin Market ” Laura and
Lizzie lie down in their curtained bed
Like two blossoms on one stem,
Like two flakes of new-fall’ n snow,
Like two wahids of 'ivory • • 1
Tipped with gold for awful kings...
“ Laura stretched her gleaming neck ” from
a hiding-place in bropkside rushes
Like a rush-imbedded swan,
Like a lily from the beck,
Like a moonlit poplar branch.
Like a vessel at the launch
When its last restraint is gone.
Among the goblins
White arid golden Lizzie stood, ■
Like a lily in a flood, —
..Like a rock of blue-reined stone
Lashed by tides obstreperously,
Like a beacon left alone
In a hoary roaring sea,
< Sending up a.golden fire, —
Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree
White with blossoms honey-sweet ,
Sore beset by wasp and. bee, —
"" Like a royal virgin town
Topped with gilded dome and spire
Close beleaguered.by a fleet
Mad to tug her standard down.
S
C. Rossetti’s father was improvisatore ;
her home atmosphere was literary ; and she
has an Italian volubility of verbiage, Alto-
gether she composed more than a thousand
pieces of verse- —yet could not “ rhyme her
troubles away.” Her nature was sensuous,
not mystical ; and a worthy lover never
came.
To give, to give, not to receive !
I long to pour myself, my soul,
Not to keep back, or count or leave,
But king with; king to give the whole.
I long for one to stir my deep —
I have had enough of help and gift —•
I long for one to search and sift
Myself, to take myself and keep.
You scratch my surface with your pm.
You stroke me smooth with hushing breath :
Nay pierce, nay probe, nay dig within,
Probe my quick core and sound my depth.
You call me with a puny call;
You talk, you smile, you nothing do:
How should I spend my heart on you —
My heart that so outweighs you all l
In her latter days she wove religious
rhymes with art perfect within its limits :
there has been no more ingenious juggler
with words. Death is the recurrent theme :
the loveliness of the Tomb, the glory of the
Bridegroom Worm.
But one will answer: Changed and pale
And sick at heart, I thirst, I fail
For love, I thirst without avail—-
Miservima.
-Sweet love , a fountain sealed to me:
Sweet love, the one sufficiency
For fill the longings that can be —
Amen.
Oh, happy they alone whose lot
Is love! I search from spot to spot:
In life, in death, I find it not —
Miserrima.

Ghristina Rossetti lacked the rarest kind
of mind. She * graces common ideas with
fancy and phrase, and delivers them in
exquisite form. Her lyrics are said, not
sung—admirably said, yet not sung. Her
personal work is* narrow, her impersonal
work shallow. But often her expression of
herself is so natural, so sincere, so poignant;
often the art of her expression is so feli-
citous, that her verses remain a book of
unnumbered beauties, the breviary of women
forlorn.

An Amer._p®et asks Swinburne what he would

“ What would you do, 0 crimson inkpot’s Tsar,
Lord of the lexicon of words that b urn and scar t ”
Probably Swinburne rather would be Tsar than
BwtGßajretit, after making an exhaustive study
gives Lond. Times some remarkable
iiM*#&hctes of the use of the power attributed to
“dowsers,” or -water-finders. He suggests that
the power is due to abnormal perceptive faculty,
equivalent to a kind of “ instinct ” similar to that
shown by homing’ pigeons. Are there any
well-authenticated, cases of “water-finding’’ in
Australia ?
IN THE OLDEN TIME
IN Tom Petrie’s Reminiscences of Early
Queensland, recorded by his daughter
Constance Petrie (Brisb., Watson,
Ferguson), we have one of the most interest-
ing and valuable books yet printed in Aus-
tralia. Thomas Petrie is a son of Andrew
Petrie, a Fifeshire Scot whom Dr. Lang’s
influence brought to N.S. Wales in 1831.
In 1537 Andrew Petrie went to Brisbane
as a clerk of works in the Govt, ser-
vice. He had experience as builder and
architect, and his native energy and sagacity
made him one of the most prominent men in
the settlement. He undertook several useful
exploring journeys on the coast ; became a
contractor for public works on an extensive
scale ; and established a well-known family.
He died in 1872.
Thomas Petrie, coming to Brisbane as a
child, saw the convict settlement j in its
infancy, and became a comrade of the
children of the local aboriginal tribes, then
very numerous. He was a boy of keen
observation, and almost everything he §aw
or heard he remembered. His book of
Reminiscences exhibits that rare combination
of a child’s memory, minute and sure, inter-
preted with a woman’s sympathy-. More
than half of it is occupied with descriptions
of aboriginal customs and experience of life
among the natives : the boy was welcomed as
one of themselves, learnt their language, and
acquired a knowledge of the character of
the Brisbane tribes greater than anyone now
living can possess. The remainder of /the
book records incidents of settlenient and
exploration, and personal stories of the
Petrie family. The volume makes no pre-
tension to literary effect, but as a simple
and graphic sketch of life in the earliest
days of Queensland it is admirable. It
is especially to be esteemed for’ its pictures
of the primitive aborigines. One- can read
all the elaborate treatises now fortunately at
our disposal without receiving the intimate
impression that these lievninislences give
quite artlessly. The reason, of course, is
obvious : Baldwin and Spencer, and Howitt
and Roth, have studied the life of the blacks ;
Thomas Petrie has lived it. They write as
aliens, with the blunted faculties of adults,
however aided by science ; he remembers as
a tribesman who saw with, the fresh vision of
a child.
When Petrie first knew the blacks, they
were a happy, healthy race. “Very happy
they were, always laughing and joking.”
“ He was never afraid that the blacks would
do him any harm, but, in those early days,
felt he would far sooner trust them than most
of the whites.” The apology for the black
face made by Dalaipi, headman of the North
Pine Tribe, is pathetic and reasonable.
Petrie is convinced that contact with whites
is responsible for the degradation and
destruction of the aboriginals. “How
different a native was in thqse old times !
He was full of manly vigour and energy, his
life was a joy to him, and the search for his
food one long pastime. It is useless to think
that we can ever blot out the injury we have
done by mission schools and unnatural
teaching.”
In the simplicity of Petrie’s narrative,
old knowledge takes on new light and
meaning. The morning and evening cry of
the blacks is an example
When aborigines are collected anywhere to-
gether, each morn at daylight a great cry arises,
breaking through the silence : this is the “ cry for
the dead.” ... It comes with the dawn and the
first call of the birds ; as the Australian bush wakes
and stirs, so do Australia’s dark children—or,,
rather, they used to, for all is changed now.. ..
Whether the dead were the better for the mourn-
ing, who can say ? But they were always faith-
fully mourned for, .each morning, and at dusk at
night. It was crying and wailing and cursing all
mixed up together, and was kept going for from
ten to twenty minutes, such a noise being made
that it was scarcely possible to hear oneself speak.
The corrobborees were occasions of general
rejoicing : with a feast, a song" and dance,
and a famous fight to wind up all. The
various tribes concerned would arrange the
fight in quite a friendly spirit, and keep it
going for a week or so; then go home to
their own districts, ‘ ‘ parting the very best
of friends with each other.” Thus the battle
was merely mimic war, a form of athletic
exercise or Olympian game. Petrie’s notes
on songs and dances are charming. The
song came first ; a few words describing some
dramatic incident or pathetic emotion ; the
dance was" invented to suit.
Ivulkaravva, living with the Noosa blacks,
fretted for her people, and she made a song which
ran as follows: “Oh, flour, where oh whore are
you now that I used to eat? Oh, oh, take me
back to my mother, there to be happy, and roam
no more.” Bhe evidently missed the flour which
her own tribe got from the white people. The
Noosa blacks made a dance to suit the song, and
the-corrobboree was considered a grand one.
Torn Petrie’s Reminiscences deserve to be
widely read and never to be forgotten.
There are seventeen illustrations from photo-
graphs—including one of the famous “ Dur-
rani boi,” who was used to meet . scientific
inquiry about his life among the blacks by
telling the inquirer to take ©if his own clothes
and go and live with the blacks himself.
THE sorceress
MICHELET’S brilliant and remarkable
study of witchcraft in the Middle
' Ages — La Sorciere —has been pub-
lished recently in an Eng. transla-
tion by C. Carrington, 13 Faubourg Mont-
martre, Paris (10s. 6 d.) The translation is
admirably made by A. 11. Allinson, who has
to a great extent preserved the melody of
Michelet’s style and even has been able to
suggest its peculiar exaltation.
A writer in one of the Eng. magazines was
the other day affirming the superiority of the
psychological to the arm-chair historian,
and declaring anew the futility of the Ger-
man notion that history may be represented
in an interminable series of petty facts. He
pleaded for large views, philosophical syn-
theses, illuminating ideas. These were in
.Michelet’s domain; lie could not anticipate
physiological psychology, but his poet s im-
agination (sometimes foresees its conclusions.
He wrote history with passion, interpreted
archives emotionally, and by endowing them
with his mvn life -lie makes dry bones live.
He does not always bring conviction of the
justice of his views, but there is no doubt of
his individual sincerity.
jt
The Sorceress is a fantasia upon history,
historically founded and often literally
adapted, yet as a whole history played
upon by Michelet’s vehement mind. A
history, of witchcraft, he says, was not his
object: he wished to portray the essential
Witch, to show how she arose and why, to
explain jier afi woman and to account for her
formula of Satanic possession. The astonish-
ing Vogue of,witchcraft in the Middle Ages
is scarcely comprehended by many modern
readers. The witches’ Sabbaths were often
vast .assemblies, sometimes connived, at by
the Church and the Law. Michelet cites
a gathering of 12,000 persons in one small
Basque canton, another of 6000 in one petty
hamlet. . .
While woman doctors are .proscribed in
Sydney hospitals, it is curious to read
Michelet’s declaration that-for, a thousand
years the people had one healer, and one
only—the Witch. Paracelsus, to whom we
owe the introduction of laudanum into
medicine, declared that he had learned from
the Witches all he knew. They roamed the
woods and gathered herbs and plants, dis-
tilling their medicinal liquors and learning
all their lore. And for reward they were
outcast and banned, and burned by tens of
thousands at the stake.
J*
From the year 500 to 1500—or a little
earlier or a little later—Europe was lost in
the quagmire of superstition, with its mud of
physical dirt and mental darkness. The
mass of the people lived in misery, under
tyranny, scarcely conceivable nowadays.
Morality, as we understand it, hardly ex-
isted. Adultery, says Michelet, was a re-
cognised institution of Christian society-
normal, established, esteemed, sung and cele-
brated ; incest was the ordinary condition of
serfs. “ There was never a bath known for a
thousand years ! We may be quit e certain not
one of those knights, those fair and ethereal
ladies, the Percivals, Tristrams, Iseults, ever
washed.” This statement, says H. Ellis,
requires some qualification ;. though doubt-
less it is generally true. Ellis adds : “ The
Church killed the bath. St. Jerome tells us
with approval that when the holy Paula
noted that any of her nuns were too careful
in this matter she would gravely reprove
them, saying that ‘ the purity of the body
and its garments 'means the impurity of the
soul.’ Or, as the modern monk of Mount
Athos still declares : A man should live in
dirt as in a coat of mail, so that his soul
may sojourn more securely within.’ ” The
fundamental idea of the opposition was this ;
that bathing is a physical stimulant.
It is not possible here to suggest the
wealth of learning with which Michelet
invests his subject—one of the most curious
in the whole realm of history: For nearly
fifty years' La Sorciere has been held valuable
and profoundly interesting, and in excellent
English dress it is not less acceptable.
Wolves, by R. FI. Sherard (Lond., Greening ;
2s. (id.). A version of an old-fashioned French
story, “ The Wild Beast of Gevaudan.”
RECEIVED
My Lady of the North, by R. Parrish (Loud.,
Putnam’s ; 65.). Another Amer. romance of love
and the war, ingeniously contrived and pleasantly
handled. There are some little failures of fact
and probability, yet the story is readable.
Pentonville Prison from Within, by “One Who
Has Been There” (Bond., Greening; 2s. 6d).
An account' of personal experience in a London
gaol, not without criminological interest. The
writer’s infatuated pursuit of an actress earned
him first two months, then six months, imprison-
ment. A male friend of the actress called to
thrash him : his defence was her photognr h :
“Women should not be made this way.” Ibis
particular prisoner seems to have been sufficiently
well -treated ; lie has no story of outrage to offt r ;
but bis well-written narrative leaves the impres-
sion he insists upon ; that the debasement or
brutalisation of prisoners is almost inseparable
from the gaol system.
N.S. W. Forest Flora, part 15, by J. H. Maiden
(Svd., Govt. Printer ; Is.) Considers blackwood ;
eucalyptus coriacca (snow gum) ; river oak ; and
western whitewood. The photographic plates are
certainly an improveihent; but their arrangement
could be bettered.- Mr. Maiden has in blackwood
an interesting subject, and he has accumulated
good material that is not at all well displayed.
The inclusion of “A Chat for School Children” is
a blunder : surely the author is supposed in this
work to be addressing a botanical audience, or, at
least, an audience of intelligent adults, and prattle
is out of place. Page-long paragraphs should be
avoided : broken matter is more easily read.

Two little democratic papers that deserve a
word of praise are W. A. Wopds’s Hobart Clipper
and Frank Hill's Charters Towers Eagle. They
are broad and bright. Some Labour papers are
dull: the idea seems to be that dullness proves
earnestness and conviction. Nonsense: the whole
idea of democracy is to make people happier, to
put more sun and smiles into their lives. A little
sermon is the sermon that goes a long way.
A. D. Bayldon, Having courteously demurred to
the criticism levelled against his unoffending book,
and Having pointed out certain verses which, in
his Opinion, contradict a portion of said criticism,
it was Resolved that the statement that “the
fresh verses are conspicuously inferior to the
nucleus of the collection,” should be amended to
read 1 ‘ the fresh verses are generally inferior to
the nucleus of the collection, and some of them are
conspicuously inferior.” Amen. lhr. 30m.
Joseph Ruskin writes:
The Sydney failure of an auction sale of good pic-
tures causes the comment (2/5/5), “No market in
Sydney for pictures.” I hear also of a young- Sjdney
painter giving up Art and taking to journalism. And
there are two or three hints in tl)e same direction.
Let every struggl#r in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane
stick to his palette. Though little demand exist for Aus-
tralian Art, a truthful ■ Australian picture, unfranied but
mounted and moderately priced, will always sesiifor 10*.
to 20*.—and more, and less. My receipts for the last five
weeks (and I have done almost as well in Brisbane and
Melbourne in previous years): SI. 41. ; 25*. ; 41. ; 21. 10s.
This stands for fourteen water-colour landscapes, half-
imperial size, on sixpenny mounts, painted in two weeks,
camping out and working reg-ular hours, 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Four weeks’ active pushing disposed of the lot, and
brought in small commissions for another batch, and one
to paint a large bush pub. for 71.
My average las-t year, after paying expenses, was-an
income of just under 3 i. per week. This is not lordly,
but ’twill serve. The secret is first the method of dis-
posal ; second, rejection of impressionism. The first is
copyright, but anyone smart enough to place copy could
possum ways for himself. As for the second : m.v buyers
know nothing about it; breadth “does not trouble them.
They want Australian fact and feeling. All you have to
do is—give it.
A vivid picture of the siege of Port Arthur is-
given by R. Barry in the Feb. Monthly Review.
This, he says, is “the whole philosophy of the
war. Both sides are equally willing to die ; but
the Japanese, though they may not be more
willing, are more able to live. They can exist on
a ball of rice a day in their five-foot-six space of
earth, smiling with fatalistic contempt, living that
they may die, and dying that they may live.”
In Feb. North American Review is an inspiring
article by Rodin on Gothic architecture in France.
He says :
Tiie Gothic is not the Gothic because of the period in
which it was developed, but because of the manner of
seeing of the period. You enter a cathedral. You'find it
full of .the mysterious life of the forest; and the reason of
it is that it reproduces that life by artistic compression,
so that the rock, the tree —Nature in fine—is there ;
an epitome of Nature. It is a mistake to imagine
that, the religious conceptions of the time were
able to bring forth these masterpieces any more
than the conceptions of to-day are re-
sponsible for tiie ugliness of our model'n structures.
The ancient edifices their beauty through the
faithful study of Nature practised by the Gothic sculp-
tors. Their only ideal was the vision they had of her...
The whole article should be studied and assimilated
by our young architects.

Do you want to feel the Vim, the Snap, and the Fire or Vigop?
Do you want Courage and Energy to support you in your cares
and tpoubles ? This Is what the Dp. McLaughlin Co.’s Electric
Belt will give you. It produces New Life —makes you feel young
again. It does wonders in a few applications. It arouses all the
dormant energies, develops muscular and nerve life, and re-
stores tho feeling of youth, courage, and vigor.
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt
Has Cured Thousands of Men and Women who had given up all hope,
who thought there was no cure for them, and they are now full of life, and
overflowing with joyous spirits. Pains have gone, weakness has disap-
peared, and full vigor is in every action.
You cannot Doubt such evidence.
Stomach, Liver and Bladder Troubles, and Sciatica.
TIMARU.
Dear Sirs,—Thanks is but poor compensation for the gratitude I feel towards you and
your Belt. When you took up my case you advised a cure in three months, but I can
assure you I will be cured long before then. I had only worn the Belt I got from vou two
nights when I began to feel a marked change for the better, and now that I have' worn it
about a month lam just about cured. My stomach trouble has all gone, tingling sensa-
tion in the feet has disappeared, dull, tired feeling has been removed, and in general, by
your Belt, I am restored to perfect health once aga n, and I consider the Belt a very
cheap article, indeed I would not be without it now if 1 had to pay several times the cost.
For what is the cost where health is concern >d ? Your Belt is cheap if it only cured one
symptom, but now that it has cured me wholly, I value it above any article I possess.
Again, Sirs, I thank you for your kind advice and attention, and sympathising
manner to me in dealing with you. Yours ever gratefully,
F.' NEWMAN.
Rheumatism, Indigestion and Debility.
HERMIDALE, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,—Having purchased one of your Iligh-Grade Belts a few months ago, I am
writing to tell you of the good effects I have received from its use. Before I wore the Belt
I was terribly weak, and had suffered from Delhi tv some years ; I used to get pains all
over my body, and always felt tired and drowsy ; liut now all that has left me, and I feel
quite a different man altogether. Some ppople say that the Dr. McLaughlin Electric
Belts are no good, but any person wanting to know of the Cure one of them has performed
in my case, kindly write to me. I consider they are a God-send to any sufferer. Any
man who buys a Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt will never regret his investment, as they
are wonderful. Any person wanting any more information, kindly write to above
address. I remain, Dear Sirs, yours very faithfullv,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Off to Town.
Come on, boys, get your bridles ; there’s the big
mob in the yard !
Who’s copped my fancy saddle-cloth ? No colts !
I’ll ride the mare ;
It’s no use fighting down the road on something
bucking hard,
And when I’m bound for town I like to know
that I ’ll get there.
Put up that rail behind you ; wait a bit till I
catch mine.
Woh ! Back ! you rushing devils J Now, then,
block her on the fence.
Woh, there ! my snorting favorite ; look out for
Number Nine.
By ghost! he nearly had you ; and his kicking s
no pretence. ,
Now, Jack, I’ll block the chestnut chap; and
ain't he rolling fat !
I don’t mind betting you a quid he gives a prop
or two.
Now, then, you dancing brumby’s foal, what game
is this you ’re at ?
Look out for Teddy's pony there ! Woh ! beauties;
let me through.
Stick up those rails behind you, Joe ; the cook
will want his horse ;
I’d take the buckjump saddle, Jack, unless you
want a fall.
You’ll ride him in the hunter? Oh, well!.have
your way, of course ;
But don’t forget a gravel-rash looks foolish at a
ball.
You should have put the saddle on the bounder in
the crush ;
A snorting, wheeling brute like that is bound to
’ break away.
Come on, young Teddy, look alive, and sling me
up that brush,
We want to get to Wilga Town and not stop here
all day.
That’s mine—that cloth—excuse me! No, I haven’t
got a strap !
I haven’t time to comb your tail, old girl, that
mud must stay !
Heigh ! look at Johnny’s chestnut! Stick to him,
Jack, old chap !
Good riding without knee-pads ! But, come on,
let’s get away !
Cut down, Joe, swing that gate for him ! Have
you got matches, Ted ?
All right, I'm ready ! Let ’em rip ! Now, Bess,
don’t play the clown !
A start at last, and goodness knows what time
we’ll get to bed !
What price the whisky and the girls ! All clear
for Wilga Town !
Don’t fret that blushing chesnut, Joe ; come round
and ride this side ;
And, J ack, by Jove, you watch him, or he’ll catch
you napping yet!— , ' '
Oh, here’s that flaming slut of'mine—l thought
I left her tied !
Go home, you silly beggar ! Go home, you rubbish,
Jet !
Now, Jack, game for a canter? Sit back, and
ram the spurs:
I think the buck’s all out of him; the colt’s as
right as rain !
I wish this jolly mare of mine would drop that
prance of hers ;
I’ll race the next best cuddy to that lignum on the
plain !
Well, just half a length you did me, but you
sneaked a bit of start,
And if the little mare was fit she’d lose your long-
legged brown !
Look at that clumsy chestnut; Jack will land
home in a cart!
Ho ! lights among the timber ! Let ’em rip for
Wilga Town !

The Man in Search of Health.
One summer day, when life seemed fair and good,
Death hard to understand,
I met a pale man walking in a wood—
A gun was in his hand.
“ What seek you, sir ?” I said in accents mild ;
“Can I of service be ? ”
The pale man paused a moment, then lie smiled —
“ I seek for Health,” said he.
“ My system has run down ; I long for rest
From sordid care and strife ;
I wish to lay my head on Nature’s breast
And live the Gentle Life.”
“What ! with a gun?” I cried in mocking words.
Said he : “It is no crime !
They told me in this wood there were some birds—
And one must pass the time.”
With that his eyes grew hard ; he raised his gun,
And, in a flash, lay dead
A little life that, sporting in the sun,
Could see no doom ahead.
It was a small brown dove ; its little breast
With its heart’s blood was dyed ;
The pale man picked it up, and made a jest,
Then threw the corpse aside.
He left; yet oft I seem, at set of sunj
To see, when trees are rife
With birds, the man who went out with a gun
To lead the Gentle Life.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
fgj
gfj
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is nob
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? if so, try
our great remedy.

llout to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Sjiecial Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of

acknowledge in the “ Correspondence" column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other A rticles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
two columns in length, or, say, 3000 ivords, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs, Letters, or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. xvhen the
address is specified and stamps are enclosed But no
MS. ivill be returned, or preserved, unless these conditions
are observed. When MS. is forwarded without stamps
for return it will be understood that the copy is to be
destroyed if not acceptable. Personal applications for
return of MS. cannot receive attention. The Bulletin

stand that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.

FROM MUKDEN TO AUSTRALIA.
After Mukden the most practical question for
Australia is, How did Japan do it ? Not, of course,
as to the mere details of the fighting. Whether
Oyama right-wheeled and Oku left-turned, and
what would have happened if somebody else had
not quick-marched, is of little consequence. The
point is, What made the Monkey capable of reach-
ing Mukden in the face of the great Bear ? Thirty,
even 10, years ago such a thing would have seemed
preposterous. Japan was at that time a pictur-
esque country of paper houses and geishas, just
the sort of thing for comic-opera setting. Mukden
has all been made possible in the brief space since
then. And how ? Australia, of all the countries in
the world, cannot afford not to find out; for Japan
has the desire to spread, and Australia is in the
way of the earliest spread.
* * * *
There doesn’t seem to be much of a secret about
the matter. It is no patent process. The vast
transformation began simply with a great belief of
the Jap in Japan. The bad Australian of the
past has had the sort of faith in Australia that has
led him to be always putting it in pawn, ever
rushing off to Cohen to get assistance to develop
his country’s great natural resources. The Jap
has been proud enough of his country to believe
that it could develop itself, and needn’t slouch
round to the pawnshop every time it wanted to
build a bridge. The Jap knew that he couldn’t
build bridges without money, but he was prepared
to make sacrifices to provide the money. For the
fiscal year to March, 1904, his land-tax more than
covered the whole of the estimates for the army
civil list, Parliament, and public instruction. It
more than paid all charges in connection with the
public debt, includinga heavy sinking fund. Of his
public debt of £1 ss. 7d. per head (to 1903), all but
about 2s. fid. was internal debt. While Australia
has to send to its foreign Cohen about £2 per
head per annum every year as interest, Japan has
to send less than fourpence per head. Its whole
national debt before the war did not amount to
two years’ revenue ; yet it had built a remarkable
navy and equipped a remarkable army. Australia
borrowed, and splashed, and now drains itself of
interest to build mansions for its foreign Cohens.
Japan made sacrifices when necessary, paid taxes,"
put up with poor things till it could pay for good’
and now builds navies and equips armies with the
interest that it doesn’t have to pay.
So far as the world knows, Japan has talked
very little of its magnificent natural resources. On
thecontrary, it has admitted that, in many respects,
its resources are poor ; but, bei tig' all it had, its
business was to make the best of them. It had no
accessible iron-ores worth mentioning fit for steel-
making ; but it knew that this is the age of
iron and steel, and that the country which doesn’t
make iron and steel does not belong to this age.
The Government therefore made a contract with
the Chinese Government for the supply of iron-
ore, built its own steel-works, and is able to
supply about 250 tons of steel rails per day. At
other Government works it builds its own war-
ships and its own locomotives. If the foreigner
could supply it with better goods than it was able
to turn out, Japan made it worth the foreigner’s
while to come and show how it was done; and
soon the foreigner was turned out as well as the
goods. Excluding Chinese, there was only one
foreigner in Japan to every 7025 Japanese
at the end of 1902. In Australia there
is one foreigner to every 18 British sub-
jects, including Hindus. The 1901 census
showed that there were over 50 per cent, more
Japanese in Australia alone than there are of all
sorts of British people (English, Australians,
Canadians, and Hindus) in Japan. That is the
extent to which Japan has been kept for the Jap.
And by a customs tariff of from 5 to 150 per cent.
ad valorem, Japan has kept its own work for its
own workman. It has sought to build up indus-
tries even when it has not had the raw products.
It has made a steel industry out of Chinese ore.
It produces no hides, yet it puts a duty of 25 per
per cent, on leather goods. In 1900 it imported
£9,775,106 of British products. The last figures
gave a year’s imports at only £5,005,526. That
shows.
*** • *
Japan has not been blessed with any Dear Old
Motherland. It has played its own game. It
hasn’t been obliged to do anything because its
mother did it; and it hasn’t been afraid to do any-
thing because it wasn’t one of the things its mother
did. It didn’t have a S.M. Herald or aB. Aus-
tralian Register, imported from Mother’s land,
and with a veneration for Mother’s ways—many
of them abandoned since the Herald and
Register were transplanted ; but they won’t see
that. It hasn’t cared a hang if France was
astonished or Britain amazed. It has had no foreign
Cohen to say that the drift of legislation caused
him great uneasiness. It smiled on as before,
even if the Times said the country was drifting to
chaos, and “Pro Bono Publico” wrote to the
Pall Mall about the Mikado’s methods. No
stroller from the other end of the earth felt he
had a right to arrive by first saloon and tell Japan
that it was going to the dogs; and Japan cer-
tainly didn’t chase him for the information, and
print it in the local Daily Telegraph with great
glee. Its people were all Japanese, and so Freetrade
wasn’t thought of, just as it wouldn’t be thought of
in Australia if Australians had a thought only for
Australia. Japan saw that there was a great
profit in the tobacco business. It brought no
ancient, moth-eaten anti-socialistic ideas from
another country ; it had only itself to consider,
and its own opinion and welfare to consult; and
it turned over that business to the State. Last
year a profit of nearly £2,000,000 resulted—and
£2,000,000 went some of the way to Mukden. But
Australia would have been told that the Mother-
land had no tobacco monopoly ; so it would have
borrowed the £2,000,000 instead.
Japan isn’t a model in all things for Australia.
It has such mighty poor material to work with.
But with that material it has done wonderful
things, and, with better material, working along
the same lines, Australia could do much more
wonderful things. Brrt Australia will never do
them until it can think in Australian, just as the
Jap thinks in Japanese. And when it has begun
to do that, then it will have begun to do the thing
that has changed the little comic-opera plaything
of 30 years ago into the man who has driven
Russia back to Mukden.
“PUBLIC MORALS.”
Whenever there is a flagging of interest in certain
charities which build their appeals upon the ruins
of the “fallen,” a deputation is received by a
Minister of the Crown in regard to Public Morals.
He can’t help it. He must listen civilly, reply
civilly ; it is part of his business. Likewise they
can’t help it. For it is part of their business, and
also a part of what little pleasure they have left to
themselves. Some folks are so religious that the
only joy they have is to think over the damnation
of others. Some folk are so superlatively good
that their sole comfort is to make public moan of
the viciousness of others. And they form deputa-
tions about public morals, or barmaids, or call
public meetings to consider the evils of dancing.
If the great majority of people were not such
hypocrites when acting in a mass, the deputation
on morals would, as a rule, receive scant courtesy.
For very few individuals profess in private to be
either extraordinarily virtuous themselves, or to
have any sympathy with the professors of extra-
ordinary virtue. But the mass of a public meet-
ing, or the “ feeling of responsibility ” of a public
position, acts as a narcotic to individualism, and
we are, most of us, smug hypocrites when faced
with the necessity of defining publicly our views
on morals. The man who, to his intimates, takes
up the attitude which may be best defined
by one of its phrases, “boys will be boys,”
in public professes an altogether unreal sym-
pathy with proposals that smack a good
deal of Chadbandism. It is a pity that it
should be so, for it is just this insincere support
which prevents the party of uneasy virtue from
achieving what of its programme (and that is a
great deal) is right and feasible. The deputation
on public morals is met with a suave sympathy ;
and a good deal that is quite impossible, and some
things that are altogether inadvisable, are -pro-
mised, as a matter of make-believe, and there the
matter ends. If it were possible for the Party of
Uneasy Virtue and the other party, which is by
no means the Party of Vice, but rather the Party
of Commonsense, to “ get to holts ” and argue out
matters steadily and honestly, with no sham pro-
fessions either side, good would probably
result. There are squalid evils of great cities, and
of rural communities too, which legislation can
ameliorate, if not altogether remedy, and such legis-
lation emphatically ought to come. But a necessary
preliminary is that that party which professes to
be Archangel, but mostly wears a hump and a
scowl where bright feathers and bright smiles
ought to be growing, and that party which is
Mere Man, and would be very much offended if
in private it were accused of being better than
Mere Man, should be able to discuss and talk
sincerely. At present hypocrisy comes between,
and in its fog what there is of good intention on
one side and of power for good on the other drift
apart.
* * *
, Why should it be so ? Let it be recognised as a
basis that a good deal of “ vice ” is merely another
way, and a quite legitimate way, of looking at
things, and that a good deal of “ virtue ” is mere
envy. The Mere Man will not like to say this in
public, but he believes it; the Superior Person
will fight it tooth and claw, but in the end
he must admit it, for it is the truth. Now the
way is clear for useful discussion. Moved by the
Superior Person that vice be abolished—the vice
which comes of that deplorable idea-preliminary
in the Scheme of Things of having two sexes.
Objected by the Mere Man that that is not possible’.
It might be (but only might be) if all men and
women were seraphs. It certainly would be
if all were cherubs. But the task is to deal
with men and women. Fierce argument ensues,
during which the Superior Person has to be often
called to order and reminded that one of the
standing orders of the debate is that “a good
deal of ‘ vice ’ is merely another way of looking at
things.” Finally agreed, somewhat surlily on
one side, that, since no general legislation is
possible by which any man detected “sighing a
non-connubial sigh shall straightway be beheaded,”
the next best thing is to strive to cut the
claws of the dragon Vice. The Mere Man
thereupon brightens up and astonishes the Superior
Person with the revelation of how a knowledge of
the world can illuminate to a practical goal a High
Moral Purpose, and these resolutions are come to
—in old-fashioned form, as a concession to some
parties to the discussion :
“Whereas, whilst immorality between persons of
the same race is regrettable, between whites and
those of alien blood it is a social danger; and
whereas the half-breed has been proved by search-
ing scientific investigation to be usually a moral
degenerate : Resolved that the Legislature be
asked to make it an offence, punishable with im-
prisonment for the white and deportation for the
alienator an alien to co-habit with a white.
‘ ‘ Whereas the law at present rightly distinguishes
between the seduction of a young girl by a stranger
and by her school-teacher or her guardian ; and
whereas the position of an employer gives a man a
very great opportunity of using undue influence :
Resolved that for her guardian, teacher, or em-
ployer to seduce a girl under the age of 16 shall be
a criminal offence, and under the age of 21 a civil
offence, for which she, and not her parents, may
recover damages. (Addendum by the Mere Man :
That juries be instructed to take mighty good care
that it is a case of seduction by the man before
awarding a penalty.)
“Whereas the woman who is, by inclination and
taste, vicious and mercenary, generally makes a
plump living out of her failings and is never to be
found ‘on the streets ’ ; and whereas the class
of street-walkers is therefore recruited main'y
from women not naturally as vicious as their lives,
who are forced to their calling by poverty,
treachery, ill-fortune, or cruelty : Resolved that
earnest efforts be made to foster home industries,
and thus employ more men workers who may take
wives; that State foundling homes be erected to
prevent women being driven to the streets by the
results of attachments not at all mercenary, and
often, on their part, in the highest sense ‘moral’:
that the exploitation in the name of charity of the
‘ fallen woman ’ be stopped, so that the unfortu-
nate wishing to retrieve herself may have a fair
chance to do so. (The wage-rate should not fall
with the character.)
“ Whereas many innocent women are recruited
for the houses of vice through being trapped by
‘ employment ’ advertisements in the daily press :
Resolved that the police keep a register of all im-
moral houses, and warn newspaper proprietors
thereof, and that it be an offence punishable with
fine and imprisonment for any newspapef to pub-
lish a ‘wanted’ advertisement from any such
house.
“ Whereas—quite a lot of things : Resolved that
the public parks be lighted at night.”
* * * *
That, as a platform for the improvement of
public morals, has at least the merit of being
practicable. It would not suppress all that is
called vice (it has been agreed that a good deal of
“ vice” is merely taking another view of things),
but it would wipe away much that is squalid and
cruel and disgusting in the life of a civilised State.
A strict, and still stricter, enforcement of the White
Australia ideal is one step on which all should
be able to agree, for, without cant and without
prejudice, the alien races and the half-breds are
an element towards greater viciousness. Better
economics, opening up the land, and establishing
home industries with strict laws against sweating,
is another step of sure benefit. And, whilst it
would be absurd to deny that many women are
vicious for the same reason as many men are,
because they like the life, it is true that the woman
whom that sort of life suits seldom gets down to
the streets and mostly ends her days in solid
material comfort, and that Phryne, who flaunts in
city streets and creates the most scandal, is very
largely the result of want of employment, want of
a foundling asylum, want of a means of recovery
after a first “fall,” want of a check on trap
advertisements, and various other wants, some
easily remediable, some to an extent remediable.
There is a good deal that could be done, and
should be done, by legislation for the suppression
of vice. The chief obstacle is not the man of
Vice, but the man of Cant.
MANUFACTURING IMPERIALISTS.
Twenty years have seen some great changes in
Australian public opinion. In 1885 Australia
to a very marked extent favored independence.
In Queensland and Victoria the coming
Republic was discussed nightly in the debating-
clubs. In N.S.W. alone was the current
in the other direction. James Anthony
Froude, in his “Oceana,” has pictured the
period not unjustly. He shows that Dali.ey’s
proposal to send a contingent to the Soudan was
not accepted by the people of N.S. Wales with
absolute unanimity, and that the objectors were
neither fools nor bad subjects. England had
withdrawn its troops, and charged Australia
with the cost of its own defence. We had been
encouraged and were expected to fit out ships
of our own, and we had already an imperfect
squadron. We had even been forced to accept a
difference in our flag. Under these circumstances
it was absurd to strip ourselves of the scanty force
which we possessed, and to leave ourselves with-
out sufficient trained men to serve our own
batteries. It was trebly ridiculous to invite
attack from the rest of the world in case the war
spread, which it was exceedingly likely to do, for
the conduct of the Egyptian business had left
Britain without a friend in Europe. So long as
Australians kept aloof from outside complications,
foreign nations might respect their neutrality.
Britain had ostentatiously told the colonies that
it wanted nothing of them except that they
should not give further trouble. For Australia,
then, to come forward unasked was to chal-
lenge attack, and was Quixotic and absurd.
Henry Parkes had plainly said that a Minister
who went into such an enterprise without leave of
Parliament, on his own responsibility, would
deserve to be impeached. England’s own attitude
to her colonies, so far as it had been defined by
the Liberal leading statesmen, had incited and
ptovokod them to dissociate themselves. Froude
i lghtly measures the situation when lie asserts
that had Halley's (or Strickland’s) Soudan Con-
tingent proposals been coldly refused, it would
have been a fresh instance of the indifference with
which the colonies were regarded, and a sign
that the separatist policy was to be persevered with
m Britain ; and an impulse would thereby have
been given to the separatist policy in Australia, to
which, m that case, the Australians might have
yielded. But the offer was accepted, notwith-
standing the ridicule and censure poured upon it,
and the Australian Republic was set back a century
or so. -Federation was imperilled. Australian
interference with old-world quarrels and old-
world wars was inaugurated, and Australian
participation in the Boer murders provisioned.
But, worse still, loyalty to the aggressive Im-
perialistic idea received departmental sanction,
and began to be taught in Australian State
schools as a subject in the curriculum.
* ♦ * *
.T) alley's move was an anti-Federal move. By
Ins bid for the segregation of New South Wales as
an individual entity, acting independently in
Imperial matters against each and all of the
Australasian confraternity of States, he
imperilled Federation and well nigh ren-
dered it impossible. Parkes denounced the
despatch of the Soudan Contingent, because
he saw that it meant divided Australian initiative.
Ihe Soudan Contingent was a blunder; fortu-
nately it was also a futility. Had it won its
purpose, Federation would have been further
delayed and Nationalism further set back.
Halley’s troops returned to Sydney from their
fruitless quest of glory, with the ludicrous spoils of
their absurd foray—a donkey and a goat; and the
warriors were hailed with uproarious laughter.
But what if those brigands had been in time to
slay and be slain ?
* • * *
As it was, the expedition served to inflame a
bastard and spurious patriotism, a degraded
“loyalty” to the Imperialistic ideal of national
aggression which had its naturally evil result when
Boers had to be coerced and slaughtered to make
room in S’Africa for Chamberlain’s Chinamen. This
spurious patriotism soon infected the public
schools. The lyrics of the abattoirs were circu-
lated in these schools, and the minds of children
saturated with gory dreams of avaricious conquest.
The children’s reading books were cumbered with
biographical notices of various butchers. Then
followed the demand that the children should be
taught “loyalty” and indoctrinated in “flagi-
olatry.” Now there is still another proposal to tie
the growing minds of the children to the
Imperialistic fetish by teaching them “civics,”
which, it is easy to imagine, will mean politics of
the Jingo kind.
* * * *
The book used in the State schools for teaching
Australian history is entitled “The History of
the Australian Colonies,” by Joseph Finney.
The concluding chapter is on “Citizenship—
Its Rights and Responsibilities.” It containsthese
two paragraphs :
It is not . . . possible for any one to accustom his mind
at once to the intelligent consideration of political
questions, and the call is clear and urgent to the boys
and youths of Australia to properly prepare themselves
for this work.
It (the duty of pupils) means obeying the rules,
observing the discipline, and behaving in accordance
with the instructions given by the teachers.
In a school, obedience to rules and the obser-
vation of discipline are undoubtedly very neces-
sary. But one does not like to think that a boy’s
or girl’s political views are to be inculcated by
the teachers acting according to a red-tape
syllabus. If history is to be taught, the queries
arise immediately, what and whose history? If
children are to be instructed in political questions,
who is to formulate the political views and select
the political view-points? The attempt to mould
our children’s minds into Britannia-ware Jingo-
ism by Imperialistic flapdoodle, by the recital of
Kipling’s bragging versified bluster, or by the
perusal of deeds of blood and burglary committed
by national buccaneers and pirates, is altogether
repellent; but all this is being done. Is it, under
the circumstances, wonderful that Imperial Jingo-
ism should have so strong a following in Australia,
though it is a sentiment altogether foreign to Aus-
tralian circumstances and Australian interests?
The minds of the young are poisoned and the
nation pays for it in the folly of the adults.

Whittling Away the Arbitration Act.

Act. If they are allowed to stand, the Act will
be to a very large extent inoperative. Excluding
decisions on matters of detail of administration
(such as tjie judgment that a common rule may
not be declared in an industry at the instance of
bodies of employers and employees who have come
to an amicable arrangement between themselves),
the blows successfully aimed at the Arbi-
tra4on Act have all been at the Prin-
ciple of preference to unionists. The policy
of the Act is to, as far as possible, enroll all work-
men in trades-unions, so that they may collectively
bargain with their employers and be collectively
responsible for keeping the industrial peace. In
pursuance of that policy the preference-to-unionists
clauses were incorporated in the Act. As an in-
ducement to join a union, and thus give, in a way,
sureties of good conduct, the union worker was
offered preference of employment. Other things
being equal, he was to have the first chance of any
work that was going In the early days of the
Act this provision was a little misunderstood,
and trade-unions and employers in many cases
came to agreements setting out that no non-
unionist was to be employed whilst there was a
unionist of any sort available. Both parties
had a perfect right to come to such an agreement,
and to observe it among themselves. But the
Arbitration Court made a mistake in registering
undertakings of this sort as “common rules,” and
seeking to enforce them by the Arbitration Act.
The scope of the Act could not be stretched by
private agreement. That fact began to be under-
stood, a little later, and these faulty judgments
revised. Then the pendulum swung back to the
opposite side, and it is now sought to be estab-
lished as the law that the “ preference to union-
ists ” clause is practically inoperative, or, as it was
put by a member of the Employers’ Federation —
The clause gran ting preference to unionists had to be
interpreted in this way, that to demand the operation of
the principle, the unionist and non-unionist must apply
at the same time. If the non-unionist applied for employ-
ment a minute before the unionist, he could be engaged.
That meant that the clause was a very little thing after all.
If the courts maintain that as the law, and justify
the exultant capitalist’s remark that the prefer-
ence to unionists clause is “a very little thing
after all,” it is obvious that the Legislature must
amend the Act. Without an effective preference
to unionists provision the Act is practically worth-
less, for it gives to trade-unions nothing in recom-
pense for the sacrifices they have to make. What
is wanted is a clause which, construed equitably,
will amount to this: that an employer must
engage a union worker if he can get one of qualifi-
cations equal to, or better than, those of a non-
unionist offering. The Bulletin is* inclined to
think that that is what the present law actually
provides. If the judges think otherwise, of course
their opinion must be respected, but the Legisla-
ture should, by an amending Act, make perfectly
clear what was all along its intention. It is un-
thinkable that after an experience of Arbitration
the State should be allowed to lapse into the old-
time barbarism of unchecked strikes and lock-outs.
♦
The High Court’s Jurisdiction.
As to the High Court being made a direct Court of
Appeal from the decisions of a single Judge of the
State courts, without an intermediate appeal to a
State Full Court, the question as to whether it is
not now actually so is at present under considera-
tion by the High Court. To be more exact, the
question at present under consideration is whether
there is, or is not, a right of appeal at present
from every decision of a Supreme Court Judge of
a State. The case in which the point arose is that
of Parkin and others v. James and others. An
originating summons in Chambers to decide cer-
tain questions arising under a will was decided by
Justice Hodges, in Victoria. Certain of the
defendants appealed direct from this decision to
the High Court, without going first to the Vic.
Full Court, as they would have been compelled
to do in the days when the Privy Council
was the ultimate court of appeal for Victoria.
The jurisdiction of the High Court was objected
to and the ease was argued, in the first place,
mainly on the question as to whether the decision
of Justice Hodges, being a decision in chambers of
a judge, was a “judgement decree, order or
sentence of the Supreme Court of a State ” within
the meaning of Section 73 of the Constitution Act
(the appellate jurisdiction section). However,
after reserving its decision, the High Court
intimated that, being unable to make up its mind
and the matter being of such vast importance, it
desired to hear fuller argument on the larger
question as to whether the words “Supreme
Court” in section 73 mean any decision of a
Supreme Court of a State whether in its original
or appellate jurisdiction (which, by the way, was
how the section was framed at the Adelaide
Convention), or whether they mean the ultimate
decision of the Supreme Court of a State. The
Court again reserved its decision after long argu-
ments. If the Court take 3 the former view,
it will mean that appeals will lie from the decision
of any and every Judge sitting in the Supreme
Court of a State. This will mean that the State
Full Court will practically drop oat, inasmuch as
a defeated and disappointed litigant can reach
finality in one step instead of {two, and the
appeal to the High Court is at present almost as
expeditious and cheap as the appeal to the State
Full Court. Of course, it will also mean an
increase in the number of High Court Justices, as
the work of sitting as a Court of Appeal from
every Supreme Court of every State would be too
extensive for three Justices to cope with. The
limit as to the amount required to be at issue to
give the right of an appeal to the High Court
(£300) would act as a check to some extent; but if
important questions arose in a case involving less
than the appealable amount, the High Court
would no doubt give special leave to appeal. If
the words “ judgment of the Supreme Court of a
State” are held to mean the final decision of
a Supreme Court —the last word it can
say on the subject—then appeals will only
lie, speaking generally, from the highest
court in the State, viz., the Full Court.
There is a possible third course open. The Court
may decide that “Supreme Court” means any
Judge sitting in the Supreme Court, but that the
concluding words of section 73 then come into the
question. They provide that “until the Parlia-
ment otherwise provides, the conditions and restric-
tions on appeals to the Sovereign in Council from
the Supreme Courts of the several States shall be
applicable to appeals from them to the High
Court.” One of the “ restrictions ” on appeals to
the Privy Council was that the P.C. would not
hear appeals from a single Judge of a State (as a
general rule) unless by special leave, as they
considered the jurisdiction of the local courts
should be first exhausted. The High Court may
hold that, the Federal Parliament not having
specifically provided otherwise, this “restriction”
still exists with respect to appeals to the High
Court. A decision on such lines would preserve
the Full Courts of the various States, but would
give the High Court power by granting “special
leave ” to dispense (in any case where it considered
such a course desirable) with the intermediate
appeal to the Full Court. The decision in Parkin
v. James (which will probably be delivered in
Sydney at this sitting) will be awaited with great
interest.
A “White Ocean.”
The Orient Co. admits that the “White Ocean”
policy has nothing to do with the increased mail
subsidy demanded ; but even if it had a great deal
to do with it, what then ? Curiously enough the
policy, though it was adopted by the Federal
Parliament without even a division, seems now to
have been almost deserted. Bitterly attacked,
and held up to scorn, barely a word is said in its
defence. The one man who, in all the mail hurly-
burly, has spoken out frankly is Westralian Agent-
General Walter James—and he is on the other
side of the world. - And yet why should a “ White
Ocean” be abandoned even if it were true (which
it isn’t) that it would mean paying a trifle more to
carry the mails ? Of all persons, anyway, the Tory
Imperialist should stick to it. To the Australian
—the,, man who believes in Australia for the
Australians—it is a much smaller matter.
For, as Walter James said in his letter to the
English papers, the yarn that the “ White Ocean ”
idea is mere white-workman’s selfishness, is plain
lie. The Australian workman scarcely thinks of
taking the Lascar’s place and pay ; it might be
better for Australia if he did. He very rarely
turns to the sea for a living, and least of all to the
deep sea. The Lascar is therefore no competitor
of his, and he doesn’t view him as such. Hence
no question of the Australian’s selfishness is in-
volved. Nor is it merely, as the other Tory says,
a matter of “foolish sentiment ” ; so far as it is a
matter of sentiment at all, the un-Australian
Imperialist of the William M‘Millan-Bruce
Smith type is mainly responsible for it. The
Australian is really two Australians on the ques-
tion. One is indifferent; believing in and striving
for an Australia that will suffice for the needs of
Australians, he troubles little about what happens
on the ocean. The other is something more of an
Imperialist—something closer to what M'Millan
and Bruce Smith have told him he should
be. Even if he doesn’t sing “ Rule Britannia ”
and “The Boys of the Bulldog Breed” quite as
often as the flag-flapper thinks he should, he feels
that, in consequence of Australia’s vast debt, jt
must continue to be a very large exporter, and
that “Rule Britannia” and the bull-dog boy are
therefore of great importance. Yet he sees a
drift—anyone who is not blind must see a drift—
which imperils British and Australian shipping.
So high an authority as the President of the
English Board of Trade told the Commons lately
that the English seaman is becoming so rare a bird
that, if the naval reserves were called out in time
of war, the British mercantile marine would have
to depend entirely on foreigners ; and it is a no-
torious fact that British war-vessels are being put
out of commission, not because they are obsolete,
but because there are not the men to man them.
Between 1860 and 1903 the number of Britishers
employed on British ships increased only 12 per
cent. ; foreigners increased 175 per cent. ; and
even then the Lascars are reckoned among the
Britishers! “The British Empire Year Book ”
(1903) tells the same tale in more detail for a recent
10 years :
1891. 1896. 1901.
British seamen .. 127,567 125,009 120,412
Foreign seamen .. 23,884 27,446 32,614
Lascars .. .. 21,322 27,911 33,610
This is on vessels registered under the British
Merchant Shipping Act. But an enormous
amount of trade has gone to foreign vessels em-
ploying practically no Britishers at all—we in
Australia know the regular French, German,
American, and Japan liners, where formerly the
regular trade was practically all British. Lord
Brassey is authority for the estimate that 25
years ago there were 200,000 British seamen,
whereas now, of the same class of men, there are
few more than 100,000. Every naval expert
admits that the disappearance of the British sea-
man and his replacement by a foreigner is perilous
to the Empire. Admiral Bowden Smith referred
the other day to “the 37,000 foreign seamen of
the mercantile marine ” (the number has, appar-
ently, grown another 5000 in three years) as “a
danger to the State ” :
In the event of a war the foreign seamen would cer-
tainly be a danger, and it was a great discredit to the
nation that we should have so large a number of foreign
seamen in our mercantile marine when we had thousands
of our own people unemployed.
In Australia the position is worse. When the
1901 census was taken 15,318 seamen were enu-
merated in N.S. Wales, and 4202 of them were
foreigners. Of N.S. Wales-born there were 4245
—only about one-fourth of the whole, though in
land transport the N.S. Wales-born numbered
two-thirds of the whole. Every authority
admits that something must be done. Every
authority admits further that practically every
other nation has “done something.” That
“control of the sea,” which the Tory
Imperialist declares is indispensable, is threatened
by a most insidious enemy. The merchant marine is
being starved. The Australian, occupying an out-
post, tried to “do something”—tried to give that
encouragement to his own race to go into an indis-
pensable business from which he is now being
driven ; and the very crowd who ought to cheer
him, curse and deride him, accuse him of selfish-
ness —him, the Australian Labor man, who is
really less concerned in the matter than almost
any other section of the Empire. And all his sin
was that, in giving help to the Empire, he trod
upon the toe of the Lascar. He didn’t know then
what he knows now, that the Tory Imperialist is
so good a patriot that, as between saving the
Empire and saving the Lascar, he will save the
Lascar.

Concerning One Constituency.
The question whether Victoria should lose a
member) and either N.S.W. or Q. gain a member
for the House of Reps., is not nearly so important
as the provincial-minded papers seek to make out.
It is a narrow question of figures. According to
the population returns as made up by the statis-
ticians, but not checked by a census, Victoria
should lose a member. Victoria claims that,
owing to the possibility of error in the popula-
tion returns as made up by death-and-birth
and departure-and-arrival statistics, no change
should be made until the unquestionable
authority of a census can be quoted. That
seems a reasonable enough attitude, seeing that
the matter is not one of desperate hurry. We are
all Australians now, or should be, and if for
another Parliament Australians living south of the
Murray return one member who should rightly be
the representative of Australians north of the
Murray, The Bulletin fails to see that there is
anything to call for broken pates. As a matter of
convenience, it would probably be best to revise
the representation figures only after each census ;
so long as a census comes at least once a decen-
nium. It is part of the game of anti-Federalism
to seek out and emphasise points of difference
between the different States, and this fervent
agitation over the location of one constituency is a
move in that game. Australians will do well to
treat the issue with indifference.

“ Disguised Individualism.”
Mr. Mackinnon, leader of the “third party” in
Victoria, has just returned from a trip to Maori-
land, where he has been studying the effects of
recent legislation. The dread of Socialism has
affected Mr. Mackinnon, and he denies that there
is such a thing in Maoriland. “It is really,” he
says, “disguised individualism of a very energetic
type.” For example :
The State coal-mines on the West Coast are simply an
effort to get the price of coal reduced for householders
against a combine.
And this:—
State fire insurance seems to me to be mainly sup-
ported by householders and others who desire to bring
down premium rates ... as the complaint of high charges
had been general.
Considering that the “ socialistic ” plank of the
Labor party which has raised all the dust about
Socialism only provides for the nationalisation of
“monopolies,” it would take a high-power micro-
scope to discern the difference between its pro-
gramme and what Mr. Mackinnon describes as
“energetic individualism.” But, after all, it is of
very little moment what Mr. Mackinnon calls
the system of labor legislation in Maoriland. Is
he prepared to support legislation on the same
lines in Victoria ? If he is, he can call it kafooz-
leemuin if that pleases him.

The High Court v. Some Adelaide Folk.
The absolute necessity for a Commonwealth High
Court is strikingly illustrated in the history of
the recent litigation that arose from an old
abortive scheme for locking the Darling
River. Way back in 1882 a number of Wil-
cannia (N.S.W.) residents started a company
for the purpose of ensuring a waterway from
that droughty district by locking the Darling
waters. The idea was to raise £2500 in the first
place, with a few hundreds of thousands to follow.
The result was a total contribution of £6Ol, which
modest capital had nearly disappeared in exes,
before the provisional directors reported that
nothing further could be done without an Act of
Parliament giving the co. power to trench on pri-
vate property. Some £3OO was required to
get a Bill through Parliament, and the secretary
of the co. went to Adelaide to explain to the mer-
chants of the Holy City the trade advantages they
wouldderive iftheUarlingwerelocked. Thereupon
good men of Adelaide subscribed £3OO odd “to
further the objects of the c 0.,” the particular
object in view being to pay the cost of putting the
required Act through the N.S.W. Parliament.
The chairman of the Adelaide Chamber of Com-
merce asked the meeting of merchants to consider
“ whether this was not really a case in which they
might subscribe a small amount even with the
ultimate probability of losing it.” They considered
that it was such a case, and put up the small sum
of money aforesaid. The Act of Parliament didn’t
come to pass. For the next 17 years the River
Darling Navigation Co. lay dormant, with a bal-
ance of £250 to its credit at fixed deposit in the
bank. In 1901 the fixed deposit had been swelled
by compound interest to £438, and then the pro-
visional directors and trustees of the coin spent
some more money in an abortive attempt to get
their poor old scheme billed by the Federal
Legislature. Finally, they were left with a
balance of £245, and lo ! the good men
of Adelaide who had subscribed the £3OO
twenty years ago, as a “contribution” to an
almost hopeless cause, now claimed that the whole
of the £245 should be returned to them without
consideration for the original Wilcannia share-
holders in the originally hopeful company. Under
these circumstances the trustees of the coin were
bound to get judicial instruction as to the owner-
ship of the £245. They applied to Justice Hol-
royd, and that usually wise man of the Vic.
Bench ruled that the Adelaide saints were entitled
not only to the money in hand, but to the full
£3OO they had subscribed “with the ultimate
probability of losing it,” as well as the costs of the
action. Which latter item in the judgment was
the more extraordinary, considering that the
trustees had no option but to bring the
case to court. They appealed to the Vic.
Supreme Court and got into further trouble.
Waxcellency Madden and co. dismissed the ap-
peal with costs. It now only remained for them
to appeal to the Federal High Court. The Privy
Council was out of the question, because the
amount involved was under £SOO, and, anyway,
the appellants, threatened with ruin, couldn’t
have risked the expense of taking their grievance
across the seas. From the Federal High Court
they got a judgment which must commend itself
to every intelligent layman. The decisions of the
two Vic. courts were upset, and the trustees of
the £245 were declared to be entitled to pay their
own costs therefrom. But great howlings come
from South Australia.
A Matter of Art.
George Black writes
It appears to me—a lover of art, but by no means a
skilled critic—that most Australian artists have fallen
into a fatally deep rut and can see nothing but its sides,
and, in the dim distance, the one light they always
follow. As a consequence, they merely repeat in our
annual exhibitions the studies of the prior one, and, for
the most part, wholly neglect the many fine subjects
which lie all around them. For instance, what Australian
artist—the Hogartii or Wilkie of the Commonwealth—
has attempted to depict for the eyes of an immediate
posterity the fast-vanishing features of an old-time bush
shanty or school—interior or exterior? Who has limned
for us the evanescent characteristics of an old-style race
meeting, or country show, or election contest, or even of
a seaside picnic? *Such subjects, and a thousand such,
have been almost wholly overlooked, for mere replicas of
scenes charming enough but-hackneyed from constant
usage and not subject to change. And yet the
value, present and prospective, of these and kindred
scenes, when indelibly fixed on canvas, might be
estimated if we endeavor to set a value on a
picture which might have been the reproduction on a
large scale of an Australian goldfield in the ranting, roar-
days. Surely some of our artists can endeavor to
snatch some measure of immortality for themselves, while
securing it for these customs, costumes, implements,
habitations, habits, and human types which are fleeting,
if nob ephemeral, and doomed to extinction as our popu-
lation becomes more fixedly and thickly settled ; as the
old methods of livelihood are altered or completely pass
away ; as the facial and physical characteristics of our
pioneers and early progenitors are modified by the Aus-
tralian climate and by intermarriage ; and as we either
become more or less distinctive in our character as a
nation when compared with parent stocks.
We do not crave for so many laborious representations
of tide-washed rocks and gleaming sands, of gum-tree
glades, and of sun-bathed plains—these in their fre-
quency have become almost stereotyped. Nor do we
hunger gTeatly, in my opinion, after fruit and
flower pieces, or fancy pictures which are figments
of morbid imagination. But surely, as a con-
stantly - developing and rapidly - changing' people,
we really do need some pictorial representation
of the different stages in our development—pictures in
genre, records of life in all its phases and moods, narra-
tions on canvas of things which really happened in days
which are gone or are going. Would it not be instruc-
tive to be able to trace through such media the gradual
transmogrifications of human visage and of bodily pro-
portions and of habits, domestic and social, since I’iiillip
first landed ? For the story must lose in the telling, if
told in print only. It is surely regrettable tliat we have
almost no authentic and high-class pictures of the early
types among colonial settlers, nor of their surroundings.
And will not posterity desire to know also what manner
of men we were ?
It is now not too late to depict those of our own days
for the benefit of generations yet unborn. It would be
still possible, I think, to limn on one canvas the changes
brought about in humans by the conditions prevailing in
Australia. There are, or were recently, homes where
four generations flourished side by side : great-grand-
fathers and grandmothers who landed in the twenties
and thirties ; their sous and daughters—grandfathers and
grandmothers—born in the thirties, forties, and fifties ;
then the third generation, fathers and mothers,
born of Australian parentage on both sides, in the
sixties, seventies, and eighties ; and lastly, their children
—born at any time during the last twenty years.
It no doubt would be difficult to give ideality to such a
picture, and to raise it above the level of mere photo-
graphic accuracy, while remaining absolutely faithful to
facial details and physical proportions. But it is the
glory of art to surmount obstacles, and I venture to say
that a family of this character, if painted with that skiil
in grouping and insight into character and type displayed
by the old Flemings, would in time have that value for
Australians, at least, which those Old World pictures have
in the eyes of all civilisation. The aborigines also present
a splendid and almost unexplored field for study. We
have only a few pictures of our autochthones, and we
want more of such portraits, and, in addition, should
have pictures of the blackfellow at play and at work,
hunting and fishing, in camp and on the warpath.
Inanimate and animal subjects are very well in their
way, but the animate are much more interesting, and it
is the human in art which appeals most strongly alike to
the senses and the reason of man. Let us have land-
scapes, seascapes, fruit pieces, fancy pictures, and
allegories by all means, but in the plenitude of
these do not let the purely human be given
an inferior place, even if it develop ordy in the direction
of portraiture. I sometimes think that the portrait?,
even the accidental ones, of Constable, Gainsborough,
Raeburn, Reynolds, Romney and Wilkie, with others,
are the most interesting of their works, at least to
students of literature. And surely we want for all the
generations which will come after us not only all that
the written word can tell concerning our nation builders
and expander's, but also all that colors laid on canvas are
able to indicate concerning them. It may not always be
practical or politic to paint such folk in portrait fashion,
but the bright or imaginative mind will ever be able to
discover or to invent an opportunity for grouping at
least some of the representative men and types of any
period, those in whom posterity will most surely be in-
terested. If you ask : “ How is the artist to live who
devotes himself to such difficult subjects?” I answer
that these may take longer to paint than those to which
we are now accustomed, but that the former would sell
more readily than the current pot-boiler, and would in-
sistently demand and would promptly receive full recog-
nition from the custodians of our national galleries and
from private collectors —weary to satiety of the constant
repetition of a few unvaried themes. But in these the
Australian note must be struck, firmly, boldly, linger-
ingly, and not in the accidental, tentative and timorous
fashion which so far has satisfied most of our artists.

Ouk harmless, inoffensive Hindu brother. Two
clips from one clay’s Argus (March 18): —
Elim Been Chord, an Indian hawker, was presented
before the Chief Justice on a charge of having assaulted a
girl, 18 years of age, at Hesket, near Romsey, on 28th
February. Accused called at the farm of the girl’s father
when she was alone, and attacked her. The girl defended
herself with a table knife. The jury found prisoner
guilty, and he was sentenced to 18 months’imprisonment.
An Indian hawker called at the residence of a
settler, about three and a-half miles from Lexton and
a-quarter of a mile from any other dwelling, and asked
his wife, who was alone in the house, except for
the baby, if she wanted to buy anything. She replied,
“ No.” He then made a grab at her, catching her by the
throat. She screamed and struggled with him, but he
placed his hand over her mouth. After continuing the
struggle for some time the woman became exhausted,
and the Hindu got the better of her, forcing her on to the
table, on which the baby was sitting, and knocking the
child on the floor. A man, alleged to be identical with
the assailant, has been committed for trial.
Even with the present Immigration Restriction
Act the settler in the far-baclc is often haunted by
the fear that returning home, he will find his
daughter or wife the victim of some outrage by a
filthy pariah ; and still the Tory cry is to open the
doors wider so that the trash may come in more
freely, and outrage may be more common. The
agitation is a great inducement to men who cherish
their wives and daughters to “settle on the
land.”

It looks as though several hogsheads of trouble
are brewing for Bung in S. Australia. Under the
last Licensing Act a third of the licenses may be
reduced by a local option vote next year, and a
third by a second vote three years later, and the
remaining third may go in 1912. Bung looked
complacently on the prospects of the first wiping
out, always expecting that it would be the other
Bung who would suffer, and that his own business
would boom in consequence ; but he is beginning
to have his doubts now. From Parliament he knows
he can’t expect relief. Nowhere in Australasia is
the church and the chapel so strong as in S. Aus-
tralia—especially the Methodist persuasion, which
looks with the coldest eye upon the barrel. Ex-
Premier Jenkins, the most crafty politician S.
Australia has had for many years, declared once
that he wasn’t afraid to make a plank of anything
which the Methodist Conference favored. Both
Labor-leader Price and John Darling (who can
unmake the Butler Government when lie pleases)
approve the Methodist attitude—both, in fact,
spoke at the meetings of the Methodist Conference
the other day. Bung has, in fact, no political
friend in S. Australia in the front rank. Even
Paris Nesbit, who has a pretty good chance of
winning a seat as a Laborite, and would open
pubs, on Sunday, doesn’t quite satisfy them,
chiefly because he would go so far towards assur-
ing the purity of the public’s tipple. And while
S. Australia is steadily moving towards prohibi-
tion, or thereabouts, it is cultivating its vineyards
all it knows, and building more wine-cellars, and
preparing to go into the spirit-distilling business,
it’s a mixed situation.

Excellent is the proposal put before N.S.W.
Minister for Education by Dr. Carroll and the
Child Study Association, that all school-children
in the State should be periodically medically
examined, with a view to remedying defects of
vision and hearing, and preventing the spread of
infectious and contagious disorders. It may or
may not be true, as one member of the deputation
asserted, that 25 per cent, of N.S.W. school
children suffer from tuberculosis and other con-
tagious diseases. But it stands to reason that a
considerable proportion, in the ordinary course and
nature of things, must. And it is just as evident
that the good health and maintenance in good health
of the little Australian is the best guarantee we can
have that the Australian adult will possess sound
lungs and a business-like digestive apparatus.
Considering the facts—that the Commonwealth’s
most crying need is population ; that immigration
is almost at a standstill; and that Australia’s
birth-rate is lower than that of any European
country except France—it’s good business to
adopt every means to preserve the lives and
strengthen the constitutions of our youngsters.
No amount of money spent in that direction could
be regarded as wasted. A State Medical Depart-
ment entrusted with the supervision of all kiddies’
health would be a good investment. Catch a
malady young and its cure is easy.

The City Council of Sydney has been
asked to prevent the blocking of the footpaths
outside certain theatres, caused by the introduc-
tion of the queue system in selling tickets. The
matter lias been referred to the police. But the
true solution of the difficulty will be found in the
passage of a regulation putting a stop to the prac-
tice of charging two prices for the same part of the
bouse (unless one be a small extra charge for book-
ing). When a theatre is doing big business, those
who would get decent seats are compelled to pay
two shillings for early-door admission to a gallery
seat which is ordinarily a shilling—loo per cent,
increase ; three shillings for a two shillings family-
circle seat, and four shillings for a three-shilling
seat in the stalls. To till up their theatres at these
increased prices, certain managers habitually keep
their doors closed until 7.40, or thereabouts.
Many people recognise that they would have to
stand for the best part of an hour in order to be
in front of the regular 7.30 rush, and so they pay
the extra imposition in order to escape the incon-
venience and publicity of a long wait in the street.
Therefore, the tail-end of those who hang on cn
queue, when they get inside, sometimes find that
another three hours of standing, or at least of in-
convenience, awaits them. The remedy is to com-
pel all theatre doors to be thrown open at seven
o clock and to charge a small booking fee to those
who wish to reserve their seats. There would
then be no blocking of traffic by the gathering of
crowds round the theatre-doors, and folks would
not be kept standing for an hour or so by
theatrical managers who want to squeeze out an
extra shilling.

Tich’s time is short at Sydney
Tivoli; at the end of this week he will pass on to
other halls, and it is stated on moderately good
authority that his hrief eccentric legs and his long
eccentric clogs will go with him. Vice Tich, there
is already one gentleman who juggles with battle-
axes and knives, and a little lady who juggles
with Indian clubs, and another gentleman is
coming who will juggle with himself, and the
French boat brings a third gentleman who will
juggle with more things. Apparently George
-Reid’s return to i-power has convinced manager
Rickards that this is the juggling season in this
country. Millis, the Figaros, the whistling Taft,
and others make up a moderate bill.

When The Players (Sydney) announced
that they were going to put on “ The Belle of
JNew York,” it looked like a very big contract for
an amateur organisation, but they got through in
creditable style. As everybody knows, “ The
Belle ” is a rather savage satire on bodies like the
N.S.W. Public Morals Association, which wants
the world made good by Act of Parliament, and,
as the Public Morals question is under discussion
just now, The Players could not have staged the
piece at a more apropos moment. W. J. Curtis
acted Icliabod Bronson in a manner that represented
well that undesirable, if humorous, character.
Clive Hayter, as Blinky Bill, the Woolloomooloo
Pet, or the Bowery Bruiser, was also good. Miss
Waldon laylor took the part of the girl who com-
plained that she always found the wicked men
following her instead of the Light, and was
decidedly more successful when masquerading as
a frisker than in the earlier scenes. With the
exception of Mrs. Lyttou’s Cora Angelique, the
most successful woman part was that of Fifi
1 ncot, by Kathleen Beattie. The rest suffered
overmuch from self-consciousness, or stage-fri<ffit
or something.

over; on Friday night the corkscrew will be
put away in the cupboard, and the two fair, frail

Wirfchs’ Circus is back from Maoriland,
and will open the big green tent in Prince Alfred
Park, Sydney, some time in April. Related that,
when the show was in Invercargill (M.L.), the
crowd was so great round the ticket waggons’ that
those who had tickets could not get away for the
pressure of those wljo wanted to get them ; so the
VVirths brought out the elephants and gently but
very firmly cleared a passage, and rounded up the
huge crowd, and had it seated in the tent in less
than 15 minutes. Then the baby elephant got
m some more fine work by unintentionally looping
wW 00 K F? ,T alked up a stee P incline, and
when about lialf-way up suddenly changed his
mind, and turned round to come back for a drink
Ihis was not in the programme. He slipped, he
clawed wildly at the whole structure with his
trunk, pulled something out of its place, turned
two somersaults and landed on his feet, with the
incline on his back. The Wirths were greatly
scared ; but the intelligent public took it for part
of the show, and demanded an encore, which the
baby firmly declined to give.

J as t weeks of the Knight-Jeffries Co.
at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) are passing out in a rush
of brief revivals and good business. “Monsieur
Beaucaire accounted for a crowded house last
Saturday, when that comedy of antique clothes

effect than marked its first production 18 months
ago, 1 hus far the practised hand of time touches
Julius Beauteous improvingly in all his heroic
undertakings. When the Bath ladies fling red
roses and raptures at their Beaucaire, the
impossible Frenchman seems less fond of
himself than he was aforetime, and in a
proportionate degree the character is more pleas-
ing. Miss Jeffries has lightened her handsome
performance of Lady Mary, who offers sufficient
motive and cue for passion to inspire a dozen
gallant knights. Frank Stirling, the frivolous
young man of the piece, frivols better than he did.
Arthur Wontner is not too glaringly evil as the
evil Duke, and whereas the minor lover parts
w ent for little in the original cast, they are now
made entertaining by Miss Russell, whose comedy
is very decorative, and Plirnmer, who has lately
acquired a plump geniality of style. For the
rest, G P. Carey upholds the pump-room
dignity of Beau Nash, as though he always took
Bath waters with his whisky. But these remarks
are merely by the way of paying compliments to
the co. in retrospect. “ Beaucaire ” has presum-
ably quitted the bill ere this, and “The Eternal
City is re-introducing a fond paternal Pope for
three nights. On Saturday, modern Rome will be
succeeded by ancient Rome, where Nero licked
his palsied chops whilst lions gnawed the Chris-
tians—in a poetical way of speaking. “Silver

When the weeps of the final “East
Lynne ” congregation have been mopped from the
Royals auditorium floors, the interesting pro-
tessional-cum-aiuateur performance of “La Fille
Du Tambour Major ” is to be staged under the
direction of M Nicol Turner, who, speaking as a
quite experienced engineer of light opera shows
promises that “Tambour Major” will be the
finest chorussed and most densely populated pro-
duction that ever was in Melbourne. Also the
principals promise to be not unworthy of this
unparalleled support, likewise the virtues of the
orchestra are above suspicion. Twenty-six selected
instrumentalists have been sworn in, and con-
ductor Hanstein will summon music from their
souls Even the hard, unrelenting members of a
theatre band can discover something of a soul
where the score of an old time opera-bouffe is
concerned.

Haw the Australian Stinking-fish cries echo and

sy dney for political reasons (that is, for financial reasons
—to get himself or his crowd into ortiee); then some Emr-
hsh papers that don't know' the Gulf of Carpentaria from
Chowder Bay take it up ; then it rolls back to this end as
the deliberate opinion of “ well-informed circles in
London. lately some stupid remarks were made by
an obscure financial” paper in London, The Opinion and
now these remarks are rumbling round Australian news-
paper offices under such headings as, ‘‘How Australasia
is Criticised Abroad— 1 Rapidly Drifting ta a State of
Chaos Numerous figures are quoted as to present
conditions, and this is the conclusion :—“ In view of these
truly alarmmg figures, it seems a pity that the relaxation
of the boycott of Australasian loans should have even
been discussed. The finances of Australasia are rapidly
drifting into a State of chaos, thanks to the growth of
Socialism on a scale which even eclipses municipal over-
trading in this country.” Now, there was no talk of
socialistic legislation ” until 1891. Down to that year
there wasn t a single Labor party in Australia. There

The best proof of the fact that the Ministries

is that they sent a number of those Labor men to

increased from £66,306,471 to £155,117,773. In the
y.mQwi?r arS i t u increase was from £155,117,773 to
£304,962,075. In the 10 years when there w'asn’t a Labor

Westraha, where there wasn’t a Labor party until 1902. In
the matter of financial reform the Australian State Labor
parties have been far less thorough than thev should
have been. Yet it is a monstrous lie to sav that the
awful figures relating to Australian debt are to be laid to
the charge oL the alleged socialism of Australian Parlia-

The N.S.W. Government proposes to set up a
pubhc trustee But he isn't to do the work that the same
officer does in M.L. It isn t proposed to allow the public
* na " ie him in their wills as executor; it doesn’t
seem that he is to have even temporary charge of intes-
tate estates. All this very unsatisfactory person is
° nno dlo . IS . fc ° tak ® ch ' ar f e of the unexpended bal-
ance of funds subscribed for public purposes, and
of unclaimed bank-balances, and of certain public
properties, and of trust funds in Government hands
If the Government isn’t prepared to go the whole
hog, and authorise the Public Trustee to do general fust
work it might at least authorise him to act where an in-
testate estate is of less value than, say, £5OO, dispensing
with the grievous expense of letters of administration,
and general ly protecting a widow’s small estate from in-
jury through neglect or delay to take out probate. Also
he should be authorised to act in cases of lunacy where no
committee is appointed. Maoriland’s first Public
Trust Act was passed as far back as 1872, and it panned
out so well that the officer’s powers have been greatly en-
by 1894 the - v had been so
much enlarged that there has not been much scope for
recent extension. No attempt whatever is made to
compel people to use the office ; it is more than self-sup-
porting ; and it competes with private offices strictly on

the integrity of funds placed in the office to be invested
as the office approves. The best proof that it is appre-
ciated ism the figures showing the total trust funds in

A large amount of the funds necessary in connection with
the highly-remunerative closer settlement schemes has

But there is a further item of £6OO not charged to the
[last half-year’s working expenses in the foregoing—
“paid on account of the late manager’s retirement.” This
extraordinary expense goes a long way towards making
the half-year’s profits look so sick. For the rest, it will
be seen, working expenses have slightly increased (the
previous term included seven months), while trading pro-
fits fell considerably. Probably this was to some extent
due to those more or less heavy writings-off which
usually accompany a change of management. The over-
draft (apart from mortgage) has gone from £692 to £5715
during the half-year, but that is due mainly to an increase
in the stock (£59,329 to £82,244). Considering the size of
the co.’s debts, the heavy liability of stocks, &c., to de-
preciation, and the very s nail amount of the reserves, it
looks dangerous to reduce the latter in order to pay a
dividend that was not earned.

Officially estimated ore reserves of some W. A.
mines as on December 31: —Golden Horseshoe 954,600
tons worth 18dwt., Lancefield 222,600 tons worth Bdwt.,
D.V. Consols 70,000 tons worth 3dwt., and Vivien 51,800

Golden Horseshoe, Kalgoorlie, according to a
circular issued by directors, is in future to treat 18,000
tons monthly of an average grade of 17 - 6dwt., irrespec-
tive of any high grade ore sen t to smelters. This will
give more confidence to holders of scrip than hitherto,
when 2000 tons produced 60 per cent, of the
returns, and 16,000 tons only 40 per cent. Investors
may see how the ore reserves pan out from the following :
No. 1 lode, 13,200 tons, 9dwt. ; No. 2, 29,500 tons,
lldwt. ; No. 3, 626,390 tons, l6dwt. ; No. 4, 258,300 tons,
24dwt. ; Branch lode, 27,000 tons, 17dwt. Evidently co.
has pretty nearly come to the end of its rich shoot,
which was producing the smelting ore, and will, in
future, have to rely on the mill. This, while it will
seriously affect output, will materially reduce costs, as
railage and smelting charges are very high. A year ago
ore reserves were estimated at 785,500 tons, containing
851,1000 z., while another 92,700 tons, containing 64,8000 z.,
were estimated but not blocked out on three sides. This
time only' ore blocked out on three sides is taken into
account.

speculation lately. Chief reason is the uncertainty
regarding the fourth level. A winze was started from
No. 3 level, was reported as being in poor ore, and was
finally stopped. Those who know the district imme-
diately concluded something had gone wrong. Rich
mines in the same district that have petered-out are
Speakman’s Find, De Baun’s Mulwarrie, Lady Shenton,
Menzies Alpha, Queensland Menzies, &c. Pole has at
least 15 months’ ore reserves ahead, and will probably
earn and pay' 9d. a month divs. ; but until the question of
the ore living at depth is settled investors will have to be
careful. A peculiar item in the half-yearly report is the
statement that “ these two mines (Pole and VVaihi) will
yet be connected by' a series of ore chutes.” These mines
are parallel, and their chances of connection therefore
seem very remote.

Westralia Waihi has been a good gambling
counter of late to those in the know, but a lot of money
has been lost by outsiders. E. O. Watt, the new manager,
was blamed for the most recent movement immediately he
took control, but he indignantly denies having' had any’-
thing to do with the matter. Watt expresses the opinion
that the mine may yet turn out trumps, but one likes data
in such cases. It appears that the last crushing published
was for a fortnight and not for a month, and that, for the
month, 1200 tons were treated for 7500 z. Yarns are afloat
as to profit being made, and that co. is now out of debt;
hut speculators should, for the present, treat the show as
a gamble.

Ivanhoe Junction, Kalgoorlie, has lately been
boomed on the strength of developments at 290 ft. in No. 2
shaft. Mining men Ilewitson and Gleisberg, who
have been inspecting, report that the sulphide ore is a
marvel of richness. But whenever duffer mines strike
sulphides, owners imagine, or pretend to imagine, that
they have struck a new Eldorado, as if sulphide ores
have not been found in pretty well every gold or silver or
other metal mine since the days of Solomon ! A good
many Kalgoorlie scrippers have been left in the mud, by
buying scrip on the strength of the alleged new develop-
ments, of which there are a few paltry specimens in the
mine’s office. If people are led by’ such things, they have
only' themselves to blame if they fall in. The mine may
be all right, but it is marvellous how some shows “ strike
ile ” whenever they announce a call.
* * •
Lake View Consols, Kalgoorlie, is pushing on
developments, and has its main shaft down 1910 ft., on a
level with Great Boulder. As latter co. is going dead
slow, it is safe betting that Consols, before the year is
out, will be a long way deeper. Unfortunately Consols,
in its deepest level, is having very poor encouragement,
the ore showing only traces and dwts., and very' few at
that.
* * * *
East Fingall, Day Dawn (W.A.), one of the
wild-cats floated on the strength of the big mine, is being
boomed. Co. was floated in 1902 with a capital of 320,000
shares of ss. each, but only 26,000 were subscribed. Like
most mines surrounding the Great Fingall, it seems no
good, and present attempt to whip up the public to buy
shares by press puffs should be guarded against.

An amusing controversy has been in progress
between W. A. Prichard, late of Bewick-Moreing and Co.,
and F. A. Govett, chairman of directors of Ivanhoe and
Lake View Consols (W.A.). Pritchard claimed credit for
the success of Ivanhoe, which is probably' the best man-
aged as it is the cheapest-run mine on the Golden Belt,
and almost the only one, bar the Great Boulder, regarding
which there has been no scandal. Both magnates, how-
ever, ignore the fact that Bob Nicholson projected and
carried out the alterations in equipment that have done
much to make the Ivanhoe what it is.

Broken Hill Prop, expects to put its salt-cake
plant to work again within a month. Meantime it is
making experiments with the further treatment of zinc
concentrates on its own account. B.H. Prop.’s ore bodies
are so very large that naturally any few months’ work
doesn’t, comparatively speaking, make much difference
to them ; still, recent developments underground have
been highly satisfactory, and have added largely to the
known ore resources.
■*•***
B.H. Prop, says it is going to roast zinc concen-
trates at Broken Hill, and a roaster has been put up. If
the Carmichael-Bradford desulphurising- process can be
adapted to roasting - zinc ore, it will be an immense im-
provement on the present wasteful and expensive system.
Much coal is used, and much of the zinc is volatilised and
lost, and if the Prop, can reduce the loss, together with
the expense of handling - , it will do for spelter smelting
what has already been done for lead. It is a clear waste
to carry both metal and sulphur down to the coast, or to
Germany, to ultimately find their way up the furnace
Hue. Quite apart from the condensation of sulphuric acid
and volatilised metals (which may or may not turn out to
be practicable), the local desulphurisation of zinc ore will
be an advance on old methods. The check the foreign
trade in zinc concentrates has got will spur local metallur-
gists to give Australia a big industry.
* * * •
There has been a sharp fall in spelter —nearly
30s. in a week. Price is now about £23 55., with a weak
market. Russia and Japan have both been good buyers,
and the talk of peace has probably made a difference.
Last .year spelter production jumped nearly 9 per cent.,
and then supplies didn’t seem strained, though an extra
£3 per ton must have brought in some metal that couldn’t
be tapped at a low price. It’s an irregular and uncertain
market altogether. In 1899 it boomed to £2B 13s. ; within
20 months it was at £lO, but that was the lowest for over
20 years. So far as Australia is concerned, it is unfor-
tunate that prices for lead and spelter are nearly always
low at the same time .; for here the two metals are prac-
tically always found together. Any estimate of profit
based on the last couple of years’ prices is pretty certain
to be illusory.
* # * *
B.H. Junction mill is now doing very good
work so far as recovery goes ; in a recent week’s run it re-
covered just 100 tons of lead from 141 J tons in the ore (equal
to 70 - 5 per cent, of the contents), and 55200 z. silver out of
10,5750 z. (recovery 52 per cent.). This is well up to
Hroken Hill average, and much past what it was until
recently. Costs (mill and mine) are, however, still high ;
excluding Junction North, which doesn’t count, they
are the highest on the B.H. lode, and dividends are not to
be so much as mentioned yet. Mine costs can only be
kept even respectably low by taking - the ore as it comes,
and that plays the mischief at times with the averages.
J unction has always been a good mine for the market, but
a wretched one for the investor, and it hasn’t altered.
Junction North, Broken Hill, has done what it
should have done all along—put the whole of the new
plant, upon which the future of the co. depends,
under control of Ulrich, engineer for the Australian
(German) Metal Co., upon whose report the magnetic
separating plant was installed, after treatment of a
bulk parcel at the co.’s works. So far as Broken
Hill is concerned, Ulrich is the pioneer of magnetic
separation on a practical scale, and the machines now
used are the result of his experimental work on the spot
for three years. What stickers these German chemists
and engineers are ! Even the English Sulphide Corpora-
tion, whose zinc works are a sort of rival of Ulrich’s, use
the Metternich system ; and that is German, too.

B.H. British has sold 1000 tons of carbonates to
the Sulphide Corporation. Recalls old times. There isn’t
another B.H. nine (outside the B.H. Prop.) that could do

British couldn’t do it often.

Crowl Creek, Shuttleton (N.S.W.), showed a
profit of £7858 for the half-year to January 31st, made
from 378 tons refined copper ; mining, smelting, and
development costs amounted to £3O 12s. per ton of rough
copper. Co.’s liquid assets total £10,313; liabilities,
£LOJ2. Financial position is stronger than had been
generally supposed, especially as over £5OOO has been
spent on the smelting and refineiy plant. But the report
isn’t definite as to quantity of sulphides' available; all
that is reported of reserves underground is that there is
ore which can be dressed to 4374 tons of 12 per cent.,
available between 430 ft. and 330 ft.—which isn’t a half-
year’s supply. As to what is below —“ The lode is more
solid and compact than any ore yet cut in the mine, and
the copper contents are higher.” But it is too early yet
to speak of quantities. Current half-year ought to let
more light into the probable future of the mine, which, so
far, there isn’t any reason to mistrust.

That shocking example of N.S.W. absenteeism,
the A.A. Co., managed last year to bleed the State to the
tune of £87,902, after unusually liberal writings-off ; and
it declared a dividend of 30s. per share (shares are £2l
10s. paid). The co. has, however, watered its stock, and
performed similar operations so often, that it is impossible
now to tell what the return is on the original small out-
lay. For instance, that other shocking absentee, the Peel
River Co., which has for years stood in the way of p:o-
-gress around Tamworth, is an offshoot from the A. A. Co.
And it isn’t the A. A. Co.’s fault that it is not much more
of a monopolist, for it fought hard and bitterly in the
early days to defend its claim to have the sole coal-mining
rights around Newcastle. Fortunately, the Brown
brothers fought just as hard and more successfully on the
other side. Mr. Jesse Gregson, long the co.’s manager,,
has lately handed over control to a successor, after seeing
the Hepburn collier} - set in order to earn more dividends
for the absentee.

Mt. Drysdale, Cobar, backs up the report of a
rich find at 275 feet with the promising report—
“ Bagging ore.” When Drysdale did some interesting-
bagging before, Dapto got the business, and costs of
treatment (including carriage) were pretty well covered
by an oz. Now there is no Dapto, and costs will be much
heavier, as the ore will probably have to go to Cockle
Creek. Unabsorbed 15,000 shares, which hung fire in
reconstruction scheme, are still begging for 6d., which
looks like a serious reflection on the alleged 3-feet reef
of 6-oz. dirt.

Mt. Boppy North, under option to Bull, con-
tinues to drive at 200 ft. in a promising reef channel,
coursing towards the parent mine’s line. North, without
any fuss, has spent some honest coin in exploratory work,
and deserves luck in locating a continuation of Mt. Boppy
lode. But the rich Boppy shoots are not likely to be
reached till they get deeper.
# * * *
Premier and Peak Extended, Cobar, two perse-
vering syndicate-ow - ned shows, adjoining erstwhile sen-
sational producer The Peak, are about the most promising
outside shows in Cobar district. Both report an almost
simultaneous strike of high-grade lead, with some silver
and gold. Up to now Cobar hasn’t opened up a silver-
lead proposition. After Longworth brothers bought The
Peak from Barrass and Connelly, the shoot of gold
petered-out, and for a time things looked lonely ; but a
better strike came along and stopped there until the pur-
chase liability wiped itself out, and the owners had some-
thing to the good. Premier mav, quite likely, cut The
Peak shoot, which isn’t more than 30ft. from Premier’s
shaft.

Mt. Boppy South has decided to work on calls ;
there is power to ask for £125 per month. ■ Main shaft

away without definite object; and the only sensible
thing the South can now do is to get down to sulphides.

White Cliffs (N.S.W.) opal mining continues
the old precarious game. The “ old hand ” certainly has
a big pull over the new “ gouger,” but even the old hand
can’t tell where the gem isn’t. For years it was thought
that “the company” (a rather mysterious and mostly -
English concern) had practically all the ground that was
worth having ; but lately Martin Brothers and Walsh
made a find which brought them in about £l5OO worth of
stone in a few weeks, and the co.’s blocks are almost
deserted, while 400 men root round the new district.
The men, of course, leave the co.’s blocks on the smallest
provocation, for the co. levies tribute—a result of the
early mistake made by the Mines Department in granting
mineral leases for ground that should have been treated
as alluvial. There is just about as much growling ts
ever over the marketing of the gem, there being a vast
difference between what diggers think they ought to get
and what buyers offer. Three-fourths of all the gem goes
to Europe—mostly Germany.

Wertago copper shows, 100 miles out from
Broken Hill, still make a struggle to live, though almost
handicapped out of the race by transit charges. Copper
has been followed down to 100 ft. ; the shoots are not
large, but the ore is rich—it can easily be hand-dressed to
35 per cent. Everything on the little field is most primi-
tive, and owners don’t seem able to make enough profit,
after paying for 100" miles of bush-track cartage and 300
miles of railage, to put things on a better basis.

Buddigower, near Wyalong (N.S.W.), is among
the disappointments. At one time, when then Mines
Minister Kidd inspected it and predicted all sorts of good
things, Buddigower was to be a second Broken Hill.
Government aid was granted to sink a shaft to 100 ft., ad-
joining leases were secured, and numerous wild cats let
loose. The property was floated, scrip sold at a big
figure, and £30,000 was asked for it. Many things have
happened since. All the leases except one have been
abandoned, and a number of calls have been made, partly
to keep the co. going, partly to provide a 4000 yd. tank,
which is now completed, and likely to prove useful to
neighboring stock-owners. Scrip is unsaleable. So far,
the best return for a bulk parcel has been obtained by D.
Taylor (tributor), who treated six tons, in Nov., 1903, for
90oz. silver per ton, leaving a net balance of £45 to the
tributor. More recently, Lindsay’s tribute put through
130 tons of tin ore for llcwt. pure tin. These parcels
were obtained from a new shaft, which is down 50ft. The
only hope, apparently, for Buddigower is for practical
people to get hold of it and erect treating appliances on
the spot. This can only be brought about by the co.
placing a reasonable price on the property', which needs
a considerable sum spent on development before it can be
of any value as an ore producer.

Manager Greenway and Railway Supt. Back,
of Chillagoe, are on their way south to attend the
meeting of shareholders, at which they will propound
a scheme for working the zinc deposits in the Mt. Garnet
mine. The methods of treatment will, it is understood,
be the same as adopted by' the B.H. Prop. ; and as
this co. has just had to suspend zinc production, it does
not look as if the newest suggestion for the salvation of
Chillagoe will amount to much. The irony of it —Mt.
Garnet, the fine copper proposition, to be worked for its
zinc I He would have been a brave man who would have
suggested this four years ago.
Ravenswood Deep Mines (N.Q.) are not looking
too bright at present. The Sunset Reef has yet to be
tapped, and it’s a certainty that more money will be
required by the co. Three small reefs penetrated by main
shaft cannot at present produce enough gold to pay for
exploratory work, so Bull will have to put his hands in
his pocket. He probably will not like it ; but Ravens-
wood owes him nothing, so he may as well try to look
cheerful.

The retreatment plant of the New Ravenswood
(N.Q.) is apparently not proving the expected blessing.
The co. installed ball mills for fine wet-crushing, and
difficulty was experienced in getting them to deal with
the required quantity; Said ball mills take some under-
standing, and it may 7 not have been their fault at
Ravenswood. A tube mill is now to be tried. Mean-
while, things are not bright on the field. The one
exception in the general slump is the London, which is
pulling itself together in good shape.

First crushings from what was known for a
while as Dickie’s find, but now as Philp’s, on Alice River
(N.Q.), have been going through. Forty-eight tons
gave 570 z., and about 12oz. had been dollied out of some
of this stone in the first day's of the field, 18 months ago.
Considering the remoteness of the place, results are not
glittering. Stone is, however, big, but reefs are not too
well-defined.

From Coolgarra (Q.): “Chinamen are edging in

mates. Then the Chows marry —not the worst-looking

One of the most aggrieved mining men in Aus-
tralia, these times, is A. P. Manton, who negotiated the
sale of Mount Molloy (Q.) to a Melbourne syndicate, some
years ago. The syndicate gave £7OOO for the property',
and found working capital up to the time when expert
Jolly—Dismal Jolly in this instance—gave a dis-
heartening report. The shareholders allowed the thing
to lapse, and, later, some of the original promoters, who
still believed in it, took it up again, and sold it for £l5OO
and a tenth interest. At present, Mount Molloy promises
to develop into a very solid copper-mine, and Manton,
after revisiting the old spot, gnashes his teeth at his luck.
He hasn’t a copper in the new spec.

New Churn Railway, Bendigo, will galvanise
the neglected New Chum line if the centre-country winze
at 4160 ft. develops a body of payable stone. As it is, the
co. holds the world’s record among gold mines for deep
sinking and for having got the precious metal at such a
depth. To trip it down to the bottom of the winze is to
get aforetaste of the Hereafter. Even in the winze, though,
the air is less oppressive than it was in the rise from
the 3850 ft. crosscut. In the matter of depth, the bottom
of the winze is still a good deal short of the deepest work-
ings in the Lake Superior copper regions. Shenandoah,
Garibaldi and Shamrock are all being- vitalised by the
development. As Catherine Reef United seems to have
got on to a patch of good stone at 2200 ft., the outlook for
the line is more cheerful than for years.

Coronation leads the way among the shows
operating in the bill district round YValhalla (Vic.).
Having the benefit of a small share register and facilities for
cheap working, little y'ields pay fair amounts. Thus only
£5OO has been called up, yet shareholders have got several
shilling divs. Stone treated so far averaged over an
ounce, hence the profits ; but it looks as if lower-grade
stone is making, and good management suggests hus-
banding profits to develop the mine. But perhaps that is
too much to ask YValhalla.

Birthday, Berringa (Vic.), has a bottom level ;

Since the Lyell Blocks bolt Yvas shot, Briseis
(Tas.) shares have been a good deal affected by dealers,
who mostly want to make up past losses by bulling the
stock. Others want to clear a com. on a turnover, and
others to persuade gudgeons that time-dealing will bring
riches. But there is no fervent desire on the part of the
genial public to bite, and there is a most positive willing-
ness on the part of Bull holders to transfer their burden of
shares across the water on the merest pretence of an invit-
ation. Yet the mine has merits to-day that it n6verhad be-
fore. Careful management saved a threatened debenture-
issue, and it also brought the overdraft down from over
£40,000 to below £30,000. This reduction was accom-
plished on a 35-ton monthly output, and while manager
Lindesay Clark was getting half the basalt on the Briseis
Hill out of the wav, as well as a fair slice of the crest of
the hillock at the extreme south. Here the lead is widen-
ing, basin-shaped, and the management is getting 21b. of
stream tin per cub. y'ard from the top lay'er of drift. It
was thought that the lead narrowed steadily to its
source back from Briseis Hill. Therefore any widening
at this point may slightly compensate for the woeful
failure of the Cascade lead to furnish dirt of value.
Backbone of the mine, however, lies in the drift under
the Briseis Hill. Only the lack of dumping area and the
slack in the Ringarooma river check an increase in
output. Costs are about £l5OO a month, so if, as is
expected, Lindesay Clark is able to double his output in
June or Julv, overdraft must disappear very rapidly. Under
3d. per cub. yard pa vs for sluicing drifts ; overburden costs
from 4d. to Bd., according to the percentage of rock pre-
sent. YVhat is wanted is a reliable estimate of the tin drift
available. Hawley used to hint at a 10 years’ life for the
mine, but present indications point to a much shorter
existence. His estimate that the drift would go about
51b. per cub. yard, however, has not been far out; and
the bottom drift at the hill and to the south may bring
up the average. It is that fact put against the un-
certainty as to the life of the mine that gives spice to
speculation in the stock.
Bang goes £5OO, Herbert J. Daly forfeiting his
option over the Scotia mine, Gladstone (Tas.)! Launces-
ton paper suggests financial reasons. This is wrong.
Lionel Robinson is the head of the syndicate that sent
Daly to view the ground, and it is folly to assume that
such a commonplace matter as financial troubles could
be associated with such well-fed prosperity as Liontl
Robinson represents.

There is much leg pulling over the recovery of
gold from sea water. Many years back Brough Smyth, of
Vic., formulated a theory (he had thousands of them) that
gold was deposited from sea water. Very delicate test)
certainly prove the existence of both silver and gold in
the sea. W. Skey, a Maorilaml chemist, discovered pro-
bably the most delicate color test for gold held in solu-
tion (color tests are used to detect infinitesimal quanti-
ties). The assertion that a ton of sea Water contains a
grain of gold is improbable ; if it did, a ton of sea salt
should contain many grains. But pan the salt and see.
Australasia still leads in gold production; last
year it gave just under one-fourth of the world’s total,
with the United States close up, and the Transvaal third.
But this year it looks as though the positions will be
altered. The Australasian output is falling, while the
other two are moving up, and the U.S. had under
100,000 oz. to go to pass us.

The electric plant of the Federal Palace Hotel,
corner Collins and King-streets, Melbourne, furnishes a
good example of a thoroughly successful electric installa-

plant generates all electric current required for the hotel
lighting; it consists of a twenty horse-power gas-engine
belted to a “ Ganz ” twelve kilowatts dynamo, a “Ganz”
switch-board containing all the measuring and controlling
instruments, and a storage battery with 62 cells. The
generating machinery runs continually during the day
time at its full capacity and highest efficiency, the surplus
current being stored into the battery ; the latter supplies
all necessary electricity required during the night; and it
forms also a substantial reserve in case of accidents.
Compared with the previous method of working, a saving
of £4OO per annum has been effected by this plant, the
contractors for which were the Austrai Otis Engineering-
Company, Ltd., corner Hanah and Kavanagh-streets,

Economical Gold Mining.—Low grade ores
and high cost in fuel and wages have made it imperative
that managers and engineers should reconstruct upon
more economical lines. Heretofore the boiler plant was
given little consideration, but the introduction of the
Hornsby “upright” water tube boiler having demons-
trated great economy, and with safety under indifferent
conditions of feed water, it is now superseding other types.

Western Australia they are looked upon as a necessity,
there being now 68 in the principal mines and Kalgoorlie

Broken Hill, and wood fuel is expensive at W.A. These
figures speak for themselves. Evidently the ease of
transportation, the economy in fuel and maintenance and
the adaptability to any class of fuel, that are such con-
spicuous points in the Babcock Boiler, are much
appreciated in Australian mines.*

A Melbourne Customs shed is just now
stocked full of Lord Northcote’s importations
from England. The Governor-General imports
everything he can, and buys as little as possible in
this country. He has the goods shipped direct to
his own order, and doesn’t even employ a local
indent agent. By a decision of doubtful legality,
and of the impropriety and bad policy of which
there is no doubt at all, the Governor-General’s
goods are exempted from all Customs duties, as
though they were goods imported for the Common-
wealth, which emphatically they are not. The
whisky and cigars and other imports of the State
Governors pay Customs duties—as it is right that
they should—but Lord Northeote can import any-
thing he chooses duty-free, and he seems to take
full advantage of the concession. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that a fair proportion of his
imports would be sparkling wines, cigars and
spirits, probably Lord Northeote saves at least ss.
in the £ on his household expenditure by this free-
dom from Customs taxation ; and that means a
very large increase in the amount of his salary, of
which the public is not aware, and over which
Parliament has no check.

Mr. Justice Pring, of the N.S.W. Supreme
Court, was notably humble to the shade of the
Jap Consul last week. That haughty Asiatic had
been subpeena-e d as a witness in a case, and had
briefly answered that he was “ too busy ” to attend
(true he was given very short notice). The
solicitor who had got this reply applied for a
warrant to compel the Jap’s attendance, but
Justice Pring alarmedly refused :
He had been informed that two mail boats left for
Japan that, day, and the Consul, who, no doubt, had
important business with his Government, was asked to
lay this aside at half-an-hour’s notice, to give evidence on
matters upon which he might not be qualified to speak. ■
The Jap seems to have got on to the nerves of
Australia. If any ordinary white man sent back
a verbal reply, “Too busy” to a subpoena, he’d
soon know that paena is Latin for punishment.

About a Maori’s libel action :
Ilonana Maioha, a venerable Maori chief who died the
other day, was probably the only Maori to threaten a news
paper with a libel
action. Honana
was a nephew of
the first Maori
king, the ex-can-
nibal warrior Po-
tatau, and one of
the emissaries
despatched from
the Waikato to
“ work up ” the
tribes against the
pakeha. A few
years ago, Hona-
na’s presence in
Auckland on a
land-cJse induced
a Star scribe to
resurrect a yarn
to the effect that
in Honana’s amor-
ous days he had
cast eyes upon
the youngest and
handsomest of the
seven wives of his
uncle the King,
eloped with her
down the Wai-
kato to Paul Tu-
haere’s at Orakei,
and thereafter
voyaged in Paul’s
schooner to Rara-
tonga, where they
abided till Pota-
tau was gathered
to his fathers.
The King had
sworn a mighty
oath that if ever
he caught his
nephew he would
decapitate him,
and stick up his
head on a post of
the village stock-
ade. A day or
two after this
little reminiscence
appeared in the
Star, a wild
figure, in a long
shirt and a tail-
coat, bounded up
the office stairs,
and demanded
compensation.
His character had been “all pakarapu,” he said,
and he was afraid to go home and face his tribe
until his reputation had been cleared. The staff tried
to pacify the injured warrior by assuring him that
the whole thing .was intended as a compliment
to his youthful prowess; but Honana would have com-
pensation, and, getting none, he rushed for a pakeha-
Maori lawyer, who promptly wrote and demanded satis-
faction for the libel. Turned out that the old chap didn’t
mind the assertion that he had stolen his uncle’s wife —
that was a. bagatelle, (A Maop proverb has it that to
steal a man’s clothes is a mean trick, but to steal his wife
the acr, of a chief ) But what stuck in Ins gizzard was
the statement about the threat to cut off his head and
pillory it on the royal fence. His tapu head ! The direst
indignity that could lie offered to a rangatira. Honana
consulted two lawyers, but when he found that they
devoted themselves chiefly to extracting cash from his
own pockets, lie gave up the suit in disgust and retired
to his potato-patch.
TEACHING THE YOUNG IDEA.
(The charitable lady visits the prize-fiyhter's home.)

N.S.W. Wine Association has, by resolu-
tion, urged that the term “ Australian ” should
be substituted for “colonial” in respect to all
Australian productions, particularly wines and
brandies. And quite rightly. “Colonial” has
got to be a term of contempt, in the Englishman’s
mind, anyhow—“the colonies” being remem-
bered as the places he used to send his gaol-birds
to. Australian wine is too good to be given a
title which suggests inferiority. Further, since
Federation the word “ colony ” has been banished
from Australia. We are a Commonwealth now,
and that Commonwealth is made up of States, not
colonies.

Councillor Taifc, of Melbourne city, has
sadly attracted the attention of the Council to the
fact that Sunday picnickers habitually gather at
the Town Hall corner, and drive from there in
drags to the accompaniment of music and song,
and other indications of pagan merriment.
“People will be thinking these are corporation
affairs,” wailed Councillor Tait, and wanted
the usual something done to suppress all signs of
joyfulness in the vicinity of the hall on Sunday.
But the Conncil sensibly declined such a con-
tract. A municipal by-law for the “Suppression
of Joy in the Vicinity of the Town Hall on Sundays
would be too humorous even for Melbourne.
One of the few V ic. lunatic-asylum deaths
that the public have heard anything about hap-
pened last week at Kew (Melb.). The patient’s
record was brief but rapid—March 2nd, admitted,
suffering from senility ; March 11th, noticed that
her left shoulder was swollen, apparently as the
result of some injury ; March 20th, dead. The
post-mortem revealed a fracture of the shoulder,
caused by the patient being raised violently by the
arms; and this was the primary cause of death.
Yet none of the personal attendants of the woman
seemed to know anything about the fracture.
The head nurse also knew nothing about it—said
she’d given orders that deceased wasn’t to be
moved at all, only rolled from side to side ; but
“she didn’t think the nurses were too careful
with patients. This was due to their lack of
training!” The same old “ natural causes ” ver-
dict accordingly did duty once more, a fractured
shoulder, due to violence, being apparently a
natural complaint in a Vie. asylum. Dr. Jones,
the newly-imported head of the department, may,
however, think differently. It is to be hoped soj
anyway.
At Beaufort (Vic.) recently the police
found a body, and several people came forward
and positively identified it as that of James
Hellyer, laborer. Amongst those who swore to
the body as that of James were two of Hellyer s
brothers, a daughter-in-law, and a nephew, so the
police were justified in thinking Hellyer was really
the dead person in their possession. At this
juncture it was notified that James Hellyer had
just been sent to gaol at Ballarat, and another
batch of relatives identified him as the true Hell-
yer, none other genuine. Meanwhile, however, the
Beaufort Hellyer had been buried at the expense
of the relatives who had claimed him. Now the
latter want their money back, declaring that the
person found dead had got himself interred by
false pretences, but the Law is disinclined to reim-
burse them, saying reasonably enough that, as they
had insisted upon claiming the deceased, they
must bear the consequences and the costs. The
complainants, however, can apply for a writ of
ejectment, and turn the stranger out of their
grave if they feel so disposed. The eagerness of
people to identify anything or anybody is a curious
trait of human nature.

A bench of “ honorariums ” at Melbourne
City Court actually remanded an accused woman
from Saturday to Monday recently. It was a
trifling manner of petty larceny, and could hardly
have occupied more than an hour, but the Bench
wanted to get away to the races, or to its bowling
match or something—so the accused had to wait
two days in gaol, for its convenience. The very
same Saturday the three High Court Judges sat
and delivered two important judgments, then
caught the afternoon express to Sydney, and
opened a court there on Monday morning.

The Most Comfortable and Up-to-date in the City. Patrons may depend upon thorougrh attention,
Attorney-General Symon had been quite a
while sharpening his little provincial axe for use
on the High Court; the occasion for drawing it
came when Chief J ustice Griffith applied to the
Government to meet the cost —a few pounds —of
housing his private library so that it might be used
as a High Court library in Sydney. Mr. Symon,
in refusing the application, raged furiously about
expenses, tip-staffs, circuits and the like, a,nd
practically claimed that the Justices of the High
Court, who by the Constitution are independent of
the Cabinet, and in some cases even of Parliament,
should become his departmental officers and
submit for his approval actions necessary to their
judicial duties. The High Court, it may be noted,
in the matter of expenses adopted from the first
the dignified method of charging only actual dis-
bursements. They cannot, as do some State Judges
who have a fixed day allowance when travelling,
make money out of their expenses. And Mr.
Symon, seeking to make out a case Against
the High Court and picking the records of
the most expensive trip it had, could not
show an expenditure per day as high as that
allowed to N.S.W. Supreme Court Judges!
Mr. Symon seeks to represent the High Court as
a sort of perambulating caravan, scattering the
taxpayers’ gold by gadding about needlessly. As
a m liter of truth, the High Court has arranged its
circuits so as to sit at Hobart only once a year, at
Perth once a year, at Brisbane and Adelaide twico
a year, at Sydney and Melbourne as required ;
and if there are no cases listed in a particular city
the circuit misses it. For instance, the Court has
not sat at Adelaide since the formal opening there.
Last week a prisoner faced Justice Hodges
in Melbourne convicted of a deliberate attempt to
suborn a juryman in a recent robbery case. The
Judge remarked: “I have to be a cold-blooded
individual, who administers justice and metes out
punishment as well as one can, not forgetting
human nature —its weaknesses and temptations.
. . . An attempt to interfere with jurors in the
discharge of their duties tends to make the ad-
ministration of justice farcical and the laughing-
stock of the community. The shortest sentence I
can see my way to give you is—six months.” Not
six years, six months ! The prisoner was a lawyer’s
clerk, and must have known exactly what he was
doing. Since the cause of the frequent disagree-
ments of juries in Melbourne is common talk
around the Courts, Justice Hodges does not seem
unduly anxious to prevent the law becoming the
laughing-stock of the community.
DURING THE “REST.”
ARTIST : “A most remarkable thing happened to
me the other day.”
MODEL: “Oh, yes, I know. You sold a picture !”
m, r ii i , ~
The Judge who sweepmgly slanders the
moral atmosphere of an entire community merely
because it happens to produce a criminal or two
whose transgressions ruffle his pet patch of moral
sensitiveness, is quite a feature in N.KW.-and
one the State can do without At Gundagai, the
other day Judge Rogers had before him two young
men who had stolen some cattle, and whose pals
had tried to rescue the said cattle from the police.
Dealing with the guilty ones, the judge condemned
Gundagai as a low place, and said he was ashamed
the town was m his district. That sort of stupid
show of vexation is unworthy of a judge.
Cardinal Moran, at Balmain (Sydney), on
Sunday, as reported by Sydney D.T. : —
It had been reported officially recently that two-thirds
of the children attending public schools were ill of some
disease, but he thanked God this could not be said of
Catholic schools, which were free from infection of any
kind.
As reported by the S. M. Herald (same speech):
A few days ago it had been stated by a member of a
deputation that two-thirds of the children attending the
public schoolsjwere suffering from some illness on account
of defective arrangements in the interior of the buildings.
The children attending the Catholic schools were free
from such maladies, and he trusted would be ever free
from them. To keep them so they must make their
schools as perfect as ever they could be made.
If the D.T. report were correct, the Cardinal
made a very serious mis-statement, and drew
from it an inference which was most prejudiced
and incorrect. But the S.M.1I. report seems to be
the correct one, for it brings the Cardinal much
closer to accuracy. Even so, he is out in his
figures. The statement (not an official re-
port, but made by a deputation to the Edu-
cation Minister) was that 25 per cent, (which
is not two-thirds) of the children attending
State schools are defective in health. Within all
human probability the children attending the
lloman Catholic schools would pan out the same
results if examined medically. There is no evi-
dence to support any claim that membership of
the R.C. church has any prophylactic value, or that
R.C. schools are better lighted and ventilated than
the State schools. If the latter is alleged, it would
be well for the Govt, to examine into the matter
with a view to the improvement of the State
schools.

“ F.” : Marriage law is, to an extent which
few women appreciate, unjustly favorable to the
sex for whose protection it exists. It is a
means of escape and support for a wife whose
husband makes her life a Hades, but it offers no
hope to the husband whose wife ought—in an
inhuman way cf speaking—to be boiled and
buried. The man is tied to the woman, not the
woman to the man, as was ludicrously shown in
the notorious Jackson case. There is no penalty
for husband-desertion, and practically no penalty
for husband-persecution. And, whilst there is a
good deal of protection for the young girl against
the young or old man, there is none for the young
boy against the young or old woman. He may be
captured at I'.i or so and married for life, at a time
when he couldn’t make a valid contract involving
tire fate of a £1 note. Marriage law (or the
administration of it, anyhow) will remain one-
sided for as long as lovely woman continues to be,
on the average, a more faithful, gentle creature
than man, and doesn’t talk too much nonsense
about her rights in too loud a tone of voice.

High cliffs and deep water have an almost
unconquerable attraction for lunatics. To send
the insane on a sea trip is to get rid of them.
The Methodist Conference in Melbourne
got a severe shock the other day, when somebody
announced that the promoters of a Wes-
leyan Industrial Exhibition had adver-
tised “a great guessing gamble,”
inviting reck loss Methodists to
invest a shilling with the un-
christian hope of winning £l4
thereby. Wesleyanism, alas ! is
not quite what it used to be in
the good old days, when founder
John preached against the sin of
the parents who permitted their
children to have any holidays,
and John’s unconverted wife sat
in a back pew and stuck her
tongue out at him. Wesleyanism
grows giddy. It has lately co-
quetted with the dangerous de-
vice of Pleasant Sunday After-
noons, with a view of attracting
the prayerless multitude; but
one of the hard-shell saints has
warned his brethren against “ the
danger of pushing the movement
to extremes.” A very Pleasant
Sunday Afternoon is unseemly in
the sight of the Lord.

The wreck of the barque
Acacia (Adelaide to Hobart), some
months missing, has been found
on the wild west coast of Vande-

of the wrecked men. There is no
lighthouse in the vicinity, no
lifeboat, no relief station of any
sort. A man wrecked there is
as good as dead. The gunboat
Cadmus has proceeded to the
spot, and it is just possible that
something may be done to remove a
condition of things that amounts to a
scandal.

The manager of a milk-distributing co.
swore in a Sydney court, the other day, that
lately it had taken 70 samples of milk as supplied
by dairy-farmers in the country, and had found 35
of them adulterated. The swindling farmers pro-
bably deserve the heavy brick which the Court
promptly threw at them ; but what about the men
behind the farmers—the landlords? Away back
behind all, it is often the Fatmafi exacting tribute
for the use of the land who is starving the infant.
And closer settlement, based on high capital
values for the land, won’t wipe out that curse.

A Scots parson of Melbourne issues
a public announcement that he intends to
preach only 10-minute sermons for the future,
and will add to the attractiveness of his
Sunday morning and evening performances with
more and brighter music. A 10-minute sermon is
a notable concession to the World, news of which
will cause much gnashing of teeth among old-
day three-hours preachers of the Church of the
Covenant, if it so happens that they are now
sentient of this world’s happenings. Ten-minute
sermons ! Will some other cleric follow with
another concession, say only Five Command-
ments ?

After much deliberation, the Victorian
Executive has decided to remit the death penalty
in the case of James Ronhan, the Ballarat lad who,
in a fit of passion, chopped up Ins girl with a
tomahawk as she was returning from a dance.
Ronhan, however, will be required to remain in
iraol for the full term of his life, without remis-
sion, which is not exactly pushing mercy to
extremes. The same Executive recently com-
muted a death sentence on aiv ourang-outang,
who had assaulted a ten-years-old female relative
under particularly revolting circumstances, to
seven years. But then he was a railway
t ‘ loyalist. ’
: A great deal of nonsense has been
talked and written about the evil wrought by Sun-
day dancing at seaside resorts. Doubtless men and
women might be more profitably engaged —men-
tally and physically—but the moral disadvantages
of the custom are less evident. The dancers
usually arrive by early boats, say at eleven or there-
abouts. They have a dance or two prior to lunch-
eaten in the open air. After lunch they often play
rounders, or some other open-air game, ere return-
ing to the dancing pavilion. At times they
emerge afterwards to go bathing or paddling in
the sea. As the last boats usually leave at six,
there are few opportunities for “those horrible
orgies hidden by the veil of darkness ” that we
read about. During some five years I spent many
summer Sundays in the vicinity of two dancing
halls. I never saw anyone during that time the
worse for liquor, never heard an oath, never saw an
act of indecency.

More dignity ! The bench of the Supreme
Court of the island of Ruritania is so narrow
that it is impossible for a Puisne Judge to pass
the Chief Justice when once the latter has
entered. Accordingly, they have followed the
common sense idea of allowing one of the Puisne
Judges to walk in first whenever the Full Court
is sitting. This fact was explained by the Chief
Justice of Ruritania to the Chief Justice of the
High Court of Barataria, on the occasion of his
first official visit, but he would have none of it.
“ Oh, dear, no ! ” he cried ; “ that wouldn’t do at
all. The Chief Justice follow one of the Puisne
Judges ? Impossible ! Have a carpenter brought
to alter the bench.” He didn’t even suggest that
one of the Puisne J udges should go into training
to leap over the lap of the Chief Justice.

When all my dreams go down the wind.
Your soft brown eyes pelluaid are
The mirrors of your constant mind.
Your hair is like the heart of Night
Surcharged with odors of the south.
Your lips, when dawning skies are bright,
Make tremulously sweet your mouth.

These barren years have left me . . . you,
Who never meant a word unkind,
Who never said a word untrue.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 28, 1905.
My Dear Arini.—
Orontes last week took away Lady and Miss
Rawson. The cabin was like a floral scene.
“Did you see my beautiful present?” asked Lady
Rawson of outsiders who came to say “Safe jour-
ney.” It was a diamond pendant and gold chain
set with pearls, which she was wearing. Some 90
Sydney women subscribed towards the ornament,
but on account of Lady Rawson’s poor health—
she bad a fainting fit last week —only one, Mrs.
Edmund Barton, went down to C ran brook* to
make the presentation. Of course there were

Wedding of Vicomte de Satge St. Jean (the
Queensland squatter) to Miss Elsie Steel was cele-
brated last week at St. Philip’s Church. Arch-
deacon Langley, the officiating clergyman, had
a trying ordeal. Three times he had to pause
an the service and fairly command the inch
that invaded the church to be silent. The mob
stood on the seats, and was as much at its ease as
if it were on its native Rocks. It commented on
the romance of the wooing and the difference of
station between the contracting parties, and when
the V oiee had Breathed, raced helter-skelter
down to the Wentworth Hotel, where the
reception was to be held, and crammed entrance
and sidewalks. The police were powerless against
its number and loudness, and the pretty little
bride had to be dragged through the admiring
throng.
Scores of Australasians go to try their luck at

Two gifted, very young and pretty damsels,
named Thackeray (their grandfather and the
great novelist were first-cousins), arrived here by
the Persic last week under the impression that we
had a good market for art stock. One of the
sisters, Miss Arline Thackeray, is a violiniste of
charm, a pupil of Louis Heintz. The other sister,
a singer, has been engaged by Mr. J. C. William-
son.
Signorina Fiorelli, the dramatic soprano whom
I mentioned awhile ago as having come out on
spec., has also been engaged by Mr. Williamson.
She will appear in about three months in
important rdles.
A correspondent:—•
Corsets get the major blame for the awful condition of
women’s health, but all of women’s clothing, from
their ridiculous hats skewered on in a nerve-racking
manner, to their tight, high-heeled shoes, is unhygienic.
The corset certainly deserves blame; the worst curse of
women’s dress is the compression of the body by tight
bodices and corsets, but the abolition of the corset is not
all that is required. So long as any kind of skirt is worn,
whether the corsets are retained or not, so long must
women suffer unnecessary anguish, so long must their
lungs be atrophied, their vital organs qualified for the
surgeon s knife, their blood impoverished to ansemia by
want of exercise, their minds stunted and nerves de-
stroyed by absorption in their own incessant discomfort
and pain.
By far the greatest weight of a woman’s always-too-
heavy clothing hangs round the waist. Bands are made
to. fit the waist, and from these the - weight of several
skirts is suspended. The weight is unevenly distributed
the least being immediately in front, and the greatest im-
mediately at the back. If a man wishes to gain an idea
of the effort required to carry skirts without corsets, let
him tie a band round his naked body below the ribs and
above the hips at the softest and least-protected part, and
let him then suspend a brick or two from the back of the
band. Most women incline to poddiness below the waist
line, due to want of exercise. (No shame to them that
they take none, dressed as they are.) The downward dra-t
of the skirts at the back and the consequent tightenin'? of
the band in front causes the body below the waist line to
bulge outwards and upwards.
~ s ° °nly gain in wearing no corset lies in the fact
that the ribs are free. On the other hand, a loss has been
suffered. The waist is more constricted (no matter how
loose the waist bands may be in the first instance) by the
downward drag of the greater weight in the back of the
skirt ; and grace of line below the waist, which is in some
degree retained by the corset, is utterly destroyed by the
unrestricted bulging in the absence of it.
It might be urged that the skirts could be hung from
the shoulders, but this would be quite satisfactory'em]!' if
the skirts were of equal weight all the way round which
they never are.
At present women have less muscular strength than
men in proportion to their weight, whatever their normal
condition should be. Therefore in merely carrying her-
self a. woman has a harder task than a man has in carry-
ing himself. Not satisfied with tins, she further handi-
caps herself by wearing a greater weight of clothing than
she would carry if she dressed like a man. Add to that
the pressure of air against her wide expanse of drapery as
she walks, a pressure which becomes tremendous in a stiff
breeze oi a gale ; add again the crippling power of the
wrapping of a skirt round the legs, which, in the horrid
dragging at each step, has something of the effect of leg-
irons, and I think we have sufficient excuse for her
neglect of exercise with its resultant shattered nerves
and anaemia..
It is the skirt that must be abolished. There are those
who declare it is impossible on grounds of modesty and
morality for men and women to dress alike. Yet in the
olden days when men wore gowns women also wore gowns
and I have never heard their modesty or morality assailed
because they didn’t wear trousers since their lords chose
to don gowns. In Turkey and China, men and women
dress almost similarly and I have never heard the modesty
or morality of the women attacked on that score. The
truth is modesty and morality are matters apart from
clothes and are neither made nor marred bv them.
I should not, however, desire to see women dressed in
trousers. Low-heeled shoes, knickerbockers resemblin''-
a boy’s, a loose kilt coming below the hips, and a sac
coat of a suitable length, would be becoming and decent
and by substituting comfort for discomfort, by giving
freedom of limb and ease of movement as well as by
saving time and labor, would allow women to take exer-
cise with pleasure and advantage, and go a long way
towards remedying the evils which keep our hospitals fuil
of wretched women.
It is all quite true —or nearly so. One kind of
modern corset, the narrow, belt-like one, is harm-
less enough, but only fairly slender women dare
wear it. Exercise or no exercise, the majority
of women will grow “poddy” about middle age,
and so for aesthetic reasons they wear the long,
constrictive corset. For aesthetic reasons also all
women wear skirts. The “one argument that
can be advanced in favor of the retention of the
skirt ”is an artistic reason. The skirt is “ artful.”
There is hardly a sane woman who would not
gladly welcome the tunic and knickerbocker
fashion. Men would be the objectors, and women
keep their skirts to please men.
On Friday last Miss L. Arnold, of the type-

Mr. and Mrs. Horace Tozer and the now his-
toric maid left Sydney, by the Miltiades, on Satur-
day. Maid, a tall, droopy- slip of a girl with a
pretty, pale, irregularly-featured face, seems to
direct the Tozer arrangements, and does so with
considerable brains and tact. Dame Tozer is in
very bad health. She undertook the journey from
London only to see her large family of grown-up
step-children (she has none of her own), who are
devoted to her. Other departers by the Aberdeen
liner were the visiting steamship people, the
Stephen Thompsons, who are en route for the
wonderland of Maoriland.
B irrister Sydney Mack, defending Oswald
O’Hara last week for murdering his wife by
cutting her throat (the wife was 18 and pretty,
the murderer aged 27), explained that the man
killed her because he loved her so. and tried to get
Judge and jury to see that a murder committed
for love is only manslaughter. As he strove he
wept realistically, and the jury wept with him
(Mr. Mack used to take the weepful parts in amateur
dramatics at the Uni. long ago, and is a good
weeper). But Judge Murray with fatal logic
showed.the jury that it was murder, and the jury
dried its eyes on its tweed sleeve and found
O Hara guilty, but with a strong recommendation
to mercy. So the weep didn’t go for nothing.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“The Commonwealth Exes, dined with the
Stonington Exes, on Thursday night. Miss Rita
Hope, after talk and coffee, played some. Lord
Northcote is always keen on submitting to
his wife’s opinion on music questions. He
is fond of commenting on that lady’s piano
talent.
“Aide Buchanan, or ‘thelnfant,’asToorakdubs

position at Stonington in Gapt. Fitzpatrick’s
place. Lp to this, the infantile pet only carried
the grey dame’s cloak or Miss Grosvenor’s girlv
remarks in the procession, and looked so
meek and inoffensive that humanitarians reckoned
he was over-burdened even then. Interesting to
note how he will shape as private sec. ; the sec.

‘There is some talk as to the recent ‘Clive-
den ’ dance. Two brisk Americans were, on the
strength of some high introductions, invited to
stay at the gun-guarded mansion flashing red on
the Fitzroy Gardens. The dowager mothered
them so charmingly that the brace of Yanks
decided to give a ball. They consulted their
hostess as to a place and date. She fixed both, the
first at her own house (as a particular compliment),
and the second on March 14th. After consulta-
tion, a satisfactory guest-list was evolved. But they
do say a few surprises enlivened the evening,
though that is scarcely credible. Verbal invita-
tions were mentioned as the cause of these alleged
surprises, but tis not likely that there were any
messages sent about to ‘drop round to Cliveden
on the 14th.’
“A dame tells me, in a perfectly innocent manner,
how lovely it was to look on the gambols and play
of a certain important somebody (a grandmother,
mind !) at a recent carnival hop. She fluttered, it
is said, about the ball-room with an air of self-
contained but noticeable gaiety, and butterflyed
from group to group, or made soft speech with a
young partner in a manner that Dickens had
gloried to treat. And when a cotillion fell due,
for which the ladies had to choose favors and
confer them on the partners they favored, the
way in which this young-old matron skipped
forward with hers, and passed a blushful young
dawdler on the track to a certain handsome sport,
was an exquisite sight to behold.
very proper and correct young Society
person who drops social gadding at certain times to
take a class m a Sunday-school, or attend church
bun-struggles, lately made the table declaration
that she would leave her mommer’s ball-room and

dazzlers were invited to a forthcoming dance.
Mortimer said with great dignity she had no

“The She Political League is being coaxed
ahead by social ministrations, garden sprees, and
moonlight serenades. Last Wednesday afternoon
and evening Mrs. York-Syme made her fine
Balwyn house and grounds festive for the League’s
sake. At night, the Dowager of Cliveden and
many others motored to the al fresco entertain-
ment. A Mr. M‘Cutcheon talked a dreary length
of politics, but the unfailing spirits of Mrs. York-
Syme, made manifest in a permanent smile, sus-
tained and cheered the suffering audience. Anton"'
the concert singers Miss Rose Mason, daughter o!

“Melbourne’s most high-flying dasher is on the
verge of an engagement with a youth of much
wool-wealth. tier jilted swain meantime looks
to break his neck—or at least a collar-stud—in a
brand-new, guaranteed-to-kill-or-eure motor.
“The dress-builder inquires if you want your
new autumn rig ‘instep-length.’ That is a Yank
idea. But it always takes the flutterer by sur-
prise, and she has to lie brought to a mirror and
have the instep-length demonstrated before she
reckons it safe to say ‘yes.’ Another Yank
notion is to have ‘ Persian lamb ’ trimming your
garb. It is probably good old goat-skin crimped
for the occasion, or ordinary curly lamb-wool, but
much virtue attaches to an epithet like Persian.
Similarly on the menu, a Parisian title glorifies a
trimmed mystery, which essentially is only the
hashed remnant of roast mutton or scalded rabbit.
There’s much virtue in a name.
“Miss Florrie Greene has only now recovered
from an illness that had her on a low diet and the
doctor's books since December. All through a
bad oyster ! Oyster-poisoning seems to be the
commonest ill in the world.
“A grass-widow has had her name struck off
the lists of three rather particular hostesses. The
action is caused by her little flirtation with a
young Australian. Various frolics culminated by
the skittish pair absenting themselves from a
private ballroom from the first, waltz to
almost the final polka. At the next private
dance her name was omitted, while the man (the
cruelty of it! —the man gets off scot-free every
time) was bidden. But he played the pretty
gentleman, faithful to his chum, and refused to go.
“There is a resolute movement just now in
Melbourne to ostracise ‘ dashers.’ Sassiety has at
last determined to snuff out the gay. A starchy
dame, who assumes almost official airs and a
Solomon dignity, has been the first to cut the
‘ dashers ’ off her lists —taking as an example the
act of a vice-regal who punished one irresponsible
Miss in this way. Quite half-a-dozen Toorak
dashers wear a chastened look and will not
sneeze without the permission of a chaperone—or,
at least, having senior advice on the matter. This
re-action always sets in after a climax of dissipa-
tion. It only means that the eleventh command-
ment is remembered, and the ‘ goey ’ set are going
to appear to do what is right, and graduate as
champion deceivers for a certain period, when there
wiil be another break-out.
“ How drawlsome Miss Maud Jeffries becomes !
Her feet drawl, her skirts drawl, her tones drawl,
and even her eyes drawl in the habitual role of
suffering heroism. You feel you’d like to bribe
some brute to call out at the fitting moment, ‘ Oh,
buck up ! ’
“The gowns and roses rioting in ‘ Beaucaire’
gave Miss Jeffries a fresh spurt. She was brighter
in her powder, patches, and her other coy acces-
sories on Saturday night than she has been for
weeks past. In every act Beaucaire and herself
sought to out-dazzle the other with trickeries of
the toilet, and in one act the honey-gold satins of
the ringleted Frenchman quite beat the blue-ancl-
rose garment of the Beauty. The golden calves of
the superb Julius were something to remember,
but the audacious coquetry of his blue velvet
throat-band something to forget.
“ Lionel Robinson, successful mining and turf
man, son of the veteran commercial editor of the
Age, has left London for a spell and at present is

young Victorian who has just entered the British

“In a racy and populous suburb, a certain
doctor was unable to make a fortune. So he sold
out the limp practice to a younger, less experi-
enced, milder member of the faculty. In a year
that mild young man with the thoughtful brow,
the air of gentle restraint and prodigiously in-
gratiating manner, had made the practice boom.
And the other day, when the present medico, de-
siring a holiday, looked round for a locum tencns,
his predecessor applied for the post. The 4 medi-
cal manner ’ is the most valuable asset for a doctor.
A Collins-street physician, who enjoys one of the
biggest practices in the State, is envied by all his
lesser brethren for his suave 4 manner.’ He
-carries with him to each ailing she such an air of
solicitude, responsibility, and gentle concern that
the sick one wants to be ill for weeks to be a con-
tinual care to the ‘dear, kind doctor.’ Surgeon
Fitzgerald is one of the few who has succeeded by
being brusque. But then he is the top surgeon iii
Victoria, and if you have to have half your liver
out, it’s not so much 4 manner ’ as a steady hand
with the saw that you look for. Tne physician
who attends the ailing she in her hours of unease
must look softly, walk gently, and administer pills
with much sugar-coated sympathy.
“ For the last few days, the smart girl has been
dashing along to a big stylish store in Collins-
street to view the underclothing of a jolly bride-
elect. A flock of her swooped down on the snowy
exhibition one day, when I happened to be there,
and the expressions of the faces were worth study-
ing. One alone was full of excitement, joy and
radiance. I reckoned at once she was an engaged
girl, on the scent for new designs in under-
wear, fired by curiosity to see the number and
shape of the most necessary items of the bridal
outfit. On another face, a shade of sad envy
lingered. Was she, her heart asked, ever to
know the sweet worries of trousseau-getting ? On
a third face, the green-eyed monster was at work,
and her expression was shuddersome. On various
others, a superior indifference rested. The old
girls get so tired—so very tired —of seeing the
snowy outfits of the young things bent on bore-
some matrimony; and disdain-rides high in their
eyes.

of the lagoon—she pointed to" the spot. 4 What

years of keen suffering. He retains his impressive

An English visitor who married wealth and
found there were few tilings money could not

friends not long ago in Melbourne. He had nine

to order a box at the Princess’ for the party. The
hotel man submitted that the boxes would only
seat four people—or five at a pinch. ‘ Have two
knocked into one ! ’ requested the man. coolly

NEEDED NEW BLOOD.
Dr. Williams 1 Pink Pills Actually Make New Blood.
“ TF ever a young girl needed new blood, I
I did,” said Miss F. Smith, Harrow-ioad,
Auburn, Sydney. “I don’t think I had
- a pint of good, red blood in my whole
body. I was pale and thin and weak, and always
ailing. I took no interest in life. In fact, every-
thing was a trouble to me till I built up my blood
with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. It was simp]}"
wonderful what they did for me. A few boxes
made me as strong and healthy as any girl I
know.”
Miss Smith was suffering from that deadly
disease—A niemia. Ansemia means bloodlessness
—and bloodlessness means Death. It is the fore-
runner of Consumption. It spares neither age nor
sex. Infants in arms, growing boys, middle-aged
men and married women —they all have Ansemia
if their energies are low, their skin sallow, their
eyes dull, their lips bluish, and their muscles
flabby and weak.
But Ansemia is most common in the young girl
just entering her teens. Womanhood makes new
demands upon her blood supply that she cannot
meet. Month after month her health, her
strength, her very life are being drained away.
No food and no care can do her any good. No
common medicine can save her. She needs new
blood—not drugs. New blood is the one thing
that can make a healthy woman of her—and Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills actually make new blood
They contain the very elements that go to make
new, pure, rich, red blood with every dose. That
is the whole secret of how they save from an early
grave every month scores of young girls whose
health and strength depend upon their blood
supply. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured Miss
Smith, of Auburn, and they will do the same for
any other young girl who is weak and ailing.
“My blood was as thin as water,” Miss Smith
resumed. “I grew deathly pale, and all my
strength seemed to leave me. My Stead was
splitting all day long, and I thought my back
would never stop aching. I was always tired,
even when 1 got up in the morning. At night
I got little or no rest. The least thing set my
heart jumping. I was as weak as water, for I had
no appetite. My whole health went to pieces.
Young girl as I was, life did not seem worth
living.
“ No medicine seemed to do me the least good,”
Miss Smith went on. “I really believed that
there was no earthly hope for girls suffering like
myself till I read about Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
curing others of my age. The first two boxes gave
me a wonderful appetite, and put new heart in
me. Then gradually the color began .to creep
back to my cheeks and lips. I slept well, and my
nerves grew steadier every day. I felt much
stronger, too. My headaches and backaches
stopped. Five boxes cured me completely. lam
a healthy girl to-day, and I owe it all to Dr.
'Williams’ Pink Pills. They saved my life.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cure bloodlessness just
as surely as food cures hunger. A pale, anaemic
person needs one thing only—new blood. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills do one thing only—they make
new blood. That is all they ao, but they do it
well. They don’t act on the bowels. They don’t
bother with mere symptoms. They don’t cure
any disease that isn’t caused originally by bad
blood. But when Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills re-
place bad blood with good blood they strike straight
at the root and cause of all common diseases like
headaches, sideaches, backaches, biliousness, in-
digestion, anaemia, neuralgia, and the special
secret troubles that every woman knows but none
of them like to talk about, even to their doctors.

nearly drowned (as also was Captain Barton,
administrator) wlien crossing the Yarilala bar.
Both were rescued, in an exhausted state, by the
native police.
Died, the other day, at Coolgardie (W.A.),
Victor Streitch, explorer. He was mineralogist
to the Elder exploration party, which crossed the
Coolgardie goldfields in 1891. He had a reward
claim some 250 miles east of Coolgardie, and was
making over to work it for a big syndicate at the
time of his death.
TOM PRICE. S.A. LABOR-LEADER.
Guy Boothby, when in Adelaide, had a
devoted chum in young Daly, nephew of an old-
time S.A. Governor. Young Daly came in for
considerable money, and thereupon took Boothby
and another pal for a wander round the world,
and thus Boothby gathered his knowledge of
places and people.
A Melbourne family of stalwart brothers
and chubby sisters inherits a great gastronomic
vigor from dad, a shaggy divine, noted for his
energy at meal-times. Tourists who have chanced
to meet the peckish parson and his hearty off-
spring at holiday resorts describe the appetite of
the hungry clan as something too healthy for
words.
Henry Windham Robinson, .dead at Otago
(M.L.), aged 76, was an early Victorian journalist,
an‘d succeeded the late Julius Vogel in the editor-
ship of Dunolly (Vic.) Advertiser, in 1860.
Some three years later, aided by Vogel, he was
appointed to a Maoriland district judgeship, from
which he retired about a year ago.
“0.K.” : Old John Pascoe Fawkner, the
self-styled “original settler of Port Phillip,”
seems to have had a particular weakness for
putting his name to paper. Came across a copy
of the original edition (1850) of “ Half Hours with
the Best Authors,” which had been one of Fawk-
ner’s favorite books. His well-known autograph
appears in each of the two volumes, not on the
fly-leaf, but written neatly in sundry marginal
places amidst the letterpress, as though to mark
the fact that he had read, learned, and inwardly
approved of it.
A London writer talks of Gilbert Parker’s
“ raven-black hair, dark complexion, big expressive
eyes, and romantic appearance, all of which
admirably fit him to dress up as a robber chief,”
and so on. Parker must have been metamorphosed
by knighthood. While in Sydney, he seemed a
remarkably delicate, mild little man. While he
did gallery-notes for the S.M. Herald, he used to
sit in the front corner seat with a wet towel round
his head, wearing the pained look of a martyr.
When his Parliamentary stuff was printed, his
readers wore the martyred look.
A CALAMITY.
SHE : “ Bronson got married since you have been away."
HE (excitedly): “ You don’t say so ! Who did it to him?”
Carl Joubert in “The Truth About the
Czar” :
Twice a day the Czar receives absolution. In his clothes
is concealed a small piece of garlic as a talisman against
the plots of his enemies. A pope of the Orthodox
Church used to lick his left eye twice a day as a pre-
ventive against the machinations of the Nihilists.
What a fine lot of tips for G. H. Reid, whose
political life is also sorely threatened !
When Br’er Alec Forrest was qualifying
for a place among Australia’s explorers he kept a
diary, which is mulga-like in its monotony. It
limps something like this: —“Rose, had prayers,
boiled billy, saddled up, travelled blank miles,
had tea, prayers, turned in.” The prayers
chronicled are worthy of a Crusade—in number,
anyhow.
When C. C. Kingston was Attorney-General
of S. Australia one of his most bitter opponents in
the Assembly was George Ash, who was serving
articles in Kingston’s office. Now one of the most
forcible of the Butler Govt.’s opponents is W. J.
Denny, who is serving articles in the office of the
Attorney-General, J. R. Anderson. Both Ash
and Denny passed from journalism into politics
and the law.
“ Galgorm ” : Be par. (B. 9/3/’O5) that
Rev. Jas. Duncan, of Foxton (M.L.), is believed
to be the oldest Presbyterian minister in the
world. Rev. Fredk. Buick, of Co. Antrim, Ire-
land, is older. He was bt>rn 1810, ordained
1835, and preached for over 65 years in the one
church at Ahoghill. He met Sir Walter Scott in
1825, when the latter was on a visit to Miss Edge-
hill. in Meath.
The Watchman discovered that the Cardi-
nal took precedence of the Prime Minister of the
Commonwealth at a mayoral affair the other
day, and shrieked over what it thought a fresh
indignity. But that is Chamberlain’s doing, and
started with the Commonwealth. The list runs—
Gov.-General, State Gov., Naval Commander in
Chief, Chief Justice of High Court, Cardinal and
Primate, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth,
and so on.
Late George Fisher, even in his darker
days, had an occasional flash. A bill was before
the House last session to enable the Lyttelton
Harbor Board to go on the loan market again, and
local members went into rhapsodies concerning
the great things the engineers were going to do
with the shallow harbor. Then George rose:
“ Mr. Speaker, ah, this proposal, sir, is a ridiculous
waste of time and money. Fools, sir. rush in
where flounders fear to tread ! ” Then he strode
out.
The sale of the Sherbrooke estate, at
Waverley (Sydney), recalls an early owner, Robert
Lowe. “ Bob, ” afterwards Viscount Sherbrooke,
who reached Sydney in 1842, for some time lived
in Macquarie-street. In the forties he-bought’the
property known as Bronte, at Nelson Bay, Waver-
ley. Lowe left Australia in 1850, but drew his
rents with surprising regularity until his death in
1892, since which time his heirs have been keeping
up the practice. It is understood that all the
Lowe properties are being put on the market.
Ex-Postmaster-General Todd, of S. Aus.,
found out lately what a comfortable thing even
accumulated simple interest is. When he was a
much younger man, the service used to give re-
tiring allowances —one of the things the State had
to offer to keep the young men from rushing
off to the goldfields. Twenty-five years ago they
were abolished ; but Charles Todd left his little
lot lying in the Treasury, which offered him 4 per
cent., and now it has had to hand over £4OOO odd.
The interest had just overtaken the principal.
“ T.F.M.” writes
Par. 16/3/’O5 is wrong in stating that John Batman was
granted 28,000 acres of land as a consolation stake when
his colossal attempt to steal the birthright of the Doutta
Galla tribe was annulled. The only consolation awarded
was this :—At a sale of Port Phillip lands held in Sydney
in Feb., 1838, the association, which had despatched Bat-
man across the Straits, purchased 9416 acres westward
of Geelong for the sum of £7919 ; and from that amount
£7OOO was written off in consideration of the time, labor
and money expended by Batman and h’s friends in pros-
pecting the country. That was the on y solatium ever given.
The Government declined to entertain a modest offer made
by Batman’s Association to purchase 3000squaremilesat £2O
the square mile, and even refused to concede “ priority of
purchase at a moderate upset price.” While on this sub-
ject it might be mentioned that, although Batman and
Fawkner have between them monopolised the credit of
founding Victoria, a careful study of the records of the
period shows that Joseph Tice Gellibrand (the Hobart
Town lawyer who was lost in the Otway ranges in 1837
with his companion Hesse) was the real father of Port
Phillip colonisation. Gellibrand was chairman and legal
adviser of the above mentioned association, and, in fact,
the prime;, mover of the whole enterprise. Doubtless it
was he who prepared the historic “ Know all men by these
presents,” etc., which Batman induced the aboriginal
lords of the soil to sign.
“ F.” : Wimpole, of the George Hotel,
St. Kilda (he died last week at the age of 60),
was one of several Well-known Melbourne
citizens who might have been frightened
into the grave long ago by the cancer
bogey. Some 15 years back Wimpole, on
the word of medical authority, supposed
'himself to be suffering from cancer ip the
tongue, but instead of cultivating the
disease in accordance with the suggestion
he recovered from the shock and resumed
his previous state of health. When a
man has been sentenced by a learned
doctor to cancer of the tongue, his
wisest policy sometimes is to go to
a dentist, who will possibly show
him that the whole trouble is due \
to a jagged decayed tooth.
“Agriculture” Swinburne,
of Victoria, says he intends to ap-
point a potato expert to teach the
market-gardeners how to grow
spuds. “I want,” he says, “some-
one who will go round and talk to
the fai-mers individually, rather
than a man who will lecture in the
towns.” Well, the expert is at
hand all right, but at present he’s
engaged bellowing against Social-
ism, while giving his friends as much
of that article as he can get hold of.
Died in Westralia, at 40 or there-
abouts, Arthur Everard, who for years
was the most talked-of youngster in Id.
Australia. He had a marvellous boy-voice,
and for a long while was the chief attraction at
the C. of E. cathedral, to which his solos used to
-draw crowds, and many offers were made to take
him a-touring. Curiously, when his voice broke
and he developed a rather good bass, he was so
horribly nervous that he practically left it unused.
Died, last week, Jules Verne, scientific
novelist, whose yarns gladdened many hundreds
of thousands of boys’ hearts. Verne was a novelist
more than a scientist. His notions of science
were sometimes ridiculously incorrect (in one
Verne story a professor daily liberates oxygen in
huge quantities in a town, and the result is that
men and animals and vegetation grow to a pro-
digious size, and even the school-boy knows that
the breath of life to vegetation is not oxygen, but
carbonic acid gas), but they nearly always fitted
in with the popular idea; and some of them
proved to be remarkably good prophecies.
A. G. Hales, Australian purple-patch war-
correspondent, of London Daily News, now
revisiting these parts, talks to The Bulletin :
The Japs, are coming to Australia —they want the north
of the continent. I feel sure of that. And, make no mis-
take, England won’t help Australia to keep them out—
she will rather help them in. When they get the north
—well, I don’t know what will happen to the south.
Some day you will be sending’ your boys to Tokio to
college. .... ~
The Chinese may help them. You don t know the
fighting Chinese ; they are getting some of that sort in
S’Africa. The shift-bosses didn’t know what they had got
hold of at first, and belted one or two of them. What
happened to those shift-bosses was hushed up. I was
there at the time. There is only one way to handle
these men —they must get Chinese bosses; the white
officer must have nothing to do with the coolies. At
present they are in charge mostly of some of the remnant
of Gordon’s old gang, but of course these men know noth-
ing of mining. I went across Asia and Europe from East
to West. My sympathies were with the Russians : I
should have been there still but for that ; but England
won’t read anything that isn’t pro-Jap. Some day it will
find that it has been lied to about the Russian just as
badly as it was about the Boer, or worse. I never had a
rude word said or a rude thing done to me in Russia.
'‘Savages” “ brutes’’—such brutes that they have
abolished capital punishment! A Russian officer showed
me a London yarn that the soldiers had to be driven
into the train with bayonets. “ You have come from
Harbin,” he said ; “ did you see any of it?” I told him
I had not. I saw the correspondent for that paper, and
asked him where I could see these things happening. He
told mg to mind my, own business and play my own game.
Another showed me all the proof he had. Some men
going to the front were “seen off” by their wives, and
the wives hung to the men, and the sergeants put their
hands on the men’s shoulders and hurried them on. But
anvbodv who has ever seen soldiers leave any country has
seen that. Of course there are some men who don’t want
to go—that’s inevitable under conscription.
The Jap. organisation is wonderful; the Russian simply
awful. The Russian supplies have been beyond descrip-
tion. Boots have crumpled up after a day’s wear. I
heard of a contractor who was said to have made four
millions. He was a Russian Jew ; many, if not most, of the
contractors, are that sort. The Jew won’t have any better
time in Russia when the war is over.
My admiration is all for the gentle, courteous, hos-
pitable, middle-class Russian. The noble is a tyrant; the
moujik is, in consequence, a danger. He is groping for a
liberty he doesn’t understand, and, so far, can only think
in bombs.
Three cities of the world have disappointed me—Mos-
cow, Pekin, and Paris. But St. Petersburg is the most
magnificent on earth.

“ Yus, releegion makes ye meeserable. Ah’m an
atheist, thank God! ”
Dr. Gorger, who used to be one of
Adelaide’s best-known surgeons, died lately in
Cannes, France. Gorger had a grateful patient,
who put him into Broken Hill in its earliest days,
and he made such good use of his stroke of luck
that, within three years, he went back to, Ger-
many, and set up “ Willyama Villa ’’—Willyama
being the alleged native-name for Broken Hill.
Humphrey Martin, Gorger’s old Adelaide partner,
is travelling, and happened to be in the south of
Europe. Gorger found him out, rang him up,
and asked him to come across from Monte Carlo
to Cannes next day. Just as Dr. Martin was
leaving to rejoin his old partner another telephone
message came —Gorger had died.

THE LAND OF LOTS O' TIME.
[For Tiik Bulletin.]
There’s 1 a little lazy land, with a palm-fringed coral
strand—
Equatorially south a few degrees—
Where the .skies are shining blue all the long, warm
summer through,
And the people’s food grows round them on the trees ;
Where man need not scheme and strive, just to keep
himself alive,
But with beatific bounty is endowed ;
Where the kava-bowl beguiles with nepenthe of the isles,
And the curse of Adam slumbers unavowed.
’Tis the Land of Lots o’ Time, of the lotus and the lime,
Of the melon, and the plantain, and the fig ;
Of the orange and the vine, and the pomegranate and
pine,
Of the mango, and the brown man’s relish-pig ;
Of yam, maize and arrowroot, dates and sago and bread-
fruit,
Rice, and cocoa-nuts in prodigal display ;
And of sugar, and of since, and of much besides that’s
nice,
And that typifies a tropical survey.
Happy Land of Lots o’ Time ! I can see it through the
grime
And the turmoil of my travail in the town.
’Tis a wooing Eden-place,"with its silver-sanded base,
And its greenly-gleaming boskage for a crown ;
With its limpid calm lagoon, and the balm-bestowing boon
Of its sweet eternal summer-time of rest.
Oh, to linger evermore, on that dreamy Southern shore,
Where whatever is seems obviously best !
And it may be very wrong to shrine laziness in song ;
And it may be very virtuous to grind,
And to live a life of shove, pent from gracious Nature’s
love,
While your pals all try to “ best ” you from behind ;
But I do not care a hang for the Philistine harangue,
Or for Grundy precepts, born of city slime,
When the blesstid day shall dawn that redeems my soul
from pawn,
I'll be trekking to the Land of Lots o’ Time.
To the Land of Lots o’ Time, with its soft, relaxing clime,
And its dear, seductive indolence of life ;
There, adopting island ways, just to drift through drowsy
days
In caresses with a brown but comely wife ;
Lost within the Coral Sea, toil and thought and trouble
free,
In that fair and living Lethe-land to find
All of Heaven there can be in this earthly state for me—
The Nirvana of a perfect peace of mind.

“ Eiram ” : Emu eggs are supplied in
large quantities to bakers in the Western districts,
who pay, on an average, 3d. for each egg. An
emu egg equals eight hen eggs for cake purposes.
The volk is rich, and well adapted for cake-
making: In the laying season I have often found
ten emu’s nests during an afternoon’s walk, each
containing from eight to nineteen eggs.
MARRIAGE A FAILURE.
JACK : “ I Veil, how did Billy turn out as a
husband?”
HESS : “ Well, he never turns out till the pubs,

“ Corio ” : S.M. Herald’s “ milking bul-
lock ” (B. 16/2/’O5)-reminds ms :—-
He was a city-bred solicitor who had come into the
west to practise. One of his first jobs was a mortgage
over 350 mixed cattle. By the aid of an old sheep-mort-
gage precedent, he at length completed the instrument
which, inter alia, bound the mortgagor under divers
penalties to shear his cattle yearly, and dispose of their
wool as directed. What price bullswool? Again, he
drew a stock-mortgage over six gelding draught horses,
containing elaborate provisions about the ownership of
their “increase.” Again, receiving instructions bv letter
for a stock-mortgage over 1000 sheep, 4-tooth hoggets he
drew the mortgage over 1000 sheep and four hoggets,
supposing, as he afterwards explained to his astonished
client, that a hogget was a little pig !
“ Jaybell ” : “Pestle” (B. 23/2/’O5) is
right re the non-diminution in numbers of the
emu. There are droves of emus passing an idyllic
existence within 40 miles of Brisbane. By the
way, I once saw a pure white emu. Few people
shoot the feathered member of Australia’s heraldic
“supporters,” believing the creature to be the
most harmless biped in the Commonwealth. For
many years the late owner of Yandilla station, on
the Darling Downs, prohibited the killing of emus
on his run ; and they multiplied until they took to
kicking lambs to death. Then 2s. Cd. apiece was
placed upon their heads.
“Marie Blaas ” : What do men mean
when they speak of “a well-spent life” ? Is it to
be a walking, writing, or working machine for
three score of years ? Is it to be an eight, ten, or
twelve hours marionette for ten lustra? Is it to
stand behind a counter, pigeon-box, altar or desk
and sell wafers, quinine, coffins, honey, men,
tooth-picks, or opinions for fifty years? Is it to
cheat, lie, fawn, smile, writhe, or chaffer for forty
years and so eke out a painful and precarious
existence ? Is it to be a prisoner in a mansion aud
a slave to an army of servants for seventy years ?
Is it to be bent in the back, dead in the brain,
sunken in the bone sockets, glassy and bloodshot
in the eyes, heavy in the jowl, depressed in the
upper temples, and clay-colored in the face for
fifty years ? Is it to be a soldier, a slaughterman,
to wear a clown’s costume with convict stripes on
the sleeves and a number on the collar, like a
registered dog, for thirty years? Is it to be a
barrister to haunt those cowards’ castles called
courts of law, and live by fomenting the vices,
quarrels, jealousies, and infirmities of men ? Again
I ask— what do men mean when they speak of a
well-spent life ?

“G. 8.”: Concerning the extinction of
Australian wild birds and animals, that cry has
always been heard in bad seasons during the last
3) years. Given two good seasons in succession,
however, and you then hear even louder com-
plaints that kangaroos, wallabies, emus, and so
forth, are nearly as bad as the rabbits. Crossing
Groongal station, on the Murrumbidgee, about 25
years ago, I counted nearly 100 emus from the
coach-top in sight at one time, and the turkeys
were past counting ; then the grass heads could-
be plucked from the box-seat. Little Bob, the
driver, told me that.about two years before, at the
same time of the year, he drove regularly either
out of Hay or out of Narrandera and never saw
an emu all the time. Still these original inhabit-
ants are gradually dying out, and we badly need a
Yellowstone Park, a Federal institution, in Aus-
tralia.
* * * *
“Alia”: Be that suggestion about im-
proving the breed of rabbits, satirised by “ Hop ”
(B. IG/2/’O5). I think that bunny might be made
commercially much more valuable than he is now.
When a boy, in the Otago district of M.L., I
occasionally came across rabbits with fur 2 or 3
inches long, thickly felted, and of a slaty-blue
color. These were locally called “Frenchies.”
Now, considering what varieties have been evolved
in the ease of other domesticated animals, what is
to prevent rabbit-breeders from developing a
distinct type of fur-bearing bunny and fixing the
strain ? With the rapid propagating powers of the
rabbit this should be easy enough. We should
thus add another to the list of our “great natural
resources,” and, perhaps, go a good way towards
solving the problem of the wild and wool-less West.
“ Rius ” : Be the birthrate outcry. I live
in a N.S.W. farming district, and have on one
side a neighbor who lias 18 children (all in 1G
years), and on the other side a couple who signifi-
cantly had their 13th cherub christened “Finis,”
but have since produced three post-final young-
sters.

“Tokay”: Once owned a peculiarly
matched pair of dogs—a huge mastiff and a
v perky, diminutive fox-terrier. The big
un, when not eating or fighting, was
invariably sleeping. The little ’un was
always awake, and though, by itself, a
useless, if conscientious custodian of
the house, was, in partnership with the
big ’un, a formidable foe. They would
be together on the laWn. Foxy would
see someone approaching, and would
bark in the most furious manner, of
course without avail. No one ever
noticed him.. Then lie would dance
frantically ( on the sleeping giant until
the giant awoke. The big ’un would
then rise slowly on his massive legs,
throw an injured look at the disturber
of his dreams, yawn, and bark solemnly
three times. After that he would
settle down to sleep again, and leave
the house to be burgled. If the intruder
didn’t go away the terrier would dance
on the big ’un again, and the perform-
ance would be repeated. But when he
was roused for the fifth or sixth time,
he always lumbered across and ate a
considerable piece of the visitor. He
was a tired dog, but reliable when he
really got started.
“ T.P.” : “ Icorner ” on Maoris (B.
23/2/’O5) is “another.” The well-bred Maori is
socially as fine a gentleman as the well-bred
Maorilander, and the low-bred Maori, even when
contaminated, is in two or three paints of good
nature streets ahead of the low white. Also, the
Maori did and does go far inland ; so far that
some tribes had to do altogether without shells
for the eyes of their carved figures. And the
Maori had a “greenstone run ” from east to west
of the South Island, over a high pass in the
Southern .Alps, which the civilised mountaineer,
with steel alpenstock and warm clothes, doesn’t
very often attempt. As for present worth, Te
Aute College can lick every other secondary
school football team in the nine provinces ; and
some of the best horsemen I’ve known have been
Maoris.

“ Gunner” : The Murray cod record goes
much over 1151 b. (B. 16/3/’O5). Near Goulburn
junction I have caught cod up to 1571 b. The
largest I have seen was “ Goulburn Jack,” landed
from an ordinary hand-line by means of a boat-
hook, and weighing 20Hlb. Believe the skeleton
is in Bendigo museum.
* * * »
“Rep.” : Once helped to catch a cod, weigh-
ing 5001 b., off the W.A. coast. There were four
of us hanging on to the line, but we had to shoot the
fish through the head before we got him aboard.
Sent him up to the goldfields, and got £lO for him
at auction. The restaurant-keeper who bought
him cleared about £2O out of the deal.

“Rap” : In February galah parrots came
in thousands to the Upper Castlereagh from
the droughty plains. They were never seen there
before, and they are now gradually returning to
their beloved plains, where rain has fallen. The
ibis also, in large flocks, follows the rains about
from district to district, and crows, swans, and
other waterfowl are greatly given to rain-roving.
A VARIATION.
FIRE-WATER JOE : “ F’r the luv of 'eaven, gi's a drop o' brandy, quick! me mate's been kicked
by your 'orse.”
PUBICAN : “No, you don’t hare me with that gag. It’s too old a chestnut.”
FIRE-WATER JOE : “ Chestnut be hanged! It was a piebald 'orse.”
“ W.J.8.” : Be personal habits of the
Afghan (“Rory,” B. 2/3/’O5). In the early days
of the W. A. goldfields there was, on the Cool-
gardie track, a dry stretch with one small “ soak ”
at half-way; on either side, two days’ tramp to
water. A prospector happened on this soak while
some Afghans (who had filled their camel-tanks
at it) were there, and found one pf them dabbling
his filthy feet in the few pints of water left. The
incensed white man shot the Afghan dead, went
back on his tracks, gave himself up to the police,
and was eventually sentenced to some years’ gaol.
But the diggers agitated, and secured his release
after he had served a few months. These niggeis
(according to the Methodist Conference) “cannot
be kept out of Heaven.” Yet the parsons are all
agreed that nobody can enter the Golden Gates
until he has been “washed white as snow.”
Strikes me that unless this condition is relaxed
“ the poor alien ” will choose the other place every
time, and will bolt for there and home comforts.

“ Cheetah ”I am impressed by the grow-
ing surliness of the male Australian character.
Long before the drought days this
characteristic was moodily apparent,
even on the fringe of the cities, where
gaiety and ungodliness generally are
supposed to hold high revel. On the
other hand, Australian womenfolk are
becoming decidedly snappy—cheeky
some would term it —in their ways.
There is much of the magpie’s pert-
ness about the Australian lass, her
manner of looking at you with a glint
of her eye, sideways; then the throaty
ogle—“ Ah ! Gam with yer ! Whatcher
givin’ us?” ending up> with a frog-in-
the-throat. deep cough. The glint and
the ogle and the cocky expression are a
decided mannerism that is as common at
the Toorakian garden party as at the sleeper-
splitters’ hop.
The dead-to-the-worldness of a Leongatha
Vic.) hotel was disturbed the other day, when a
laughing-jack, pursued by a hawk, dashed into
a room through a shut window. Jack made
a frantic rush at a big mirror, with the hawk
hanging on to his back wheel; looking-glass
survived, and the birds retired in disorder. Before
those in the room could get to them they had got
their second wind, and made a death-or-glory
joint charge at a second shut window and
escaped by breaking the glass.

‘ ‘ Darius ” : Be bush craze for patent-
medicines. Many years ago, when certain pills
and ointment were in vogue, I knew an old shep-
herd who was a true believer. Used to swallow
the contents of a medium-sized box of the pills
every week ; and once, when he ran out of pills,
he used up six large pots of the ointment, spread-
ing it on his bread like butter. Said it was
“ mighty healin’ to the innards.”

“ E.M.” : In that cauldron of Earth’s un-
reclaimed, Broome, Northern Westralia, hundreds
of Japanese are working, under contract, for the
pearlers. Signing-on in Singapore for three years,
they receive three months’ advance at 30s. per
month, and, when that debt is cancelled, and a
few pounds due, Fujita or Kumara, or whatever
his name may be, will draw what is owing, but
will nearly always hand the money back, with a
request that it be sent to a mother or father in
Japan. “ who is old, and whose other unworthy
sons are fighting in the honorable dispute with
Russia, and whose grandchildren are unworthily
young, so cannot help the excellent mother.”
Should the money not be required by parents or
relatives, the Japanese will certainly send it to
the national war fund.
“W.S.T.”: If “Janor” (B. 16/3/’op) is
Australian-born, I can understand his dislike to
marsupial flesh, as nine-tenths of our “natives”
do not care for game of any kind. I have seen
good, fat, black duck—our choicest game bird —go
begging up-country. But I can assure “ J.” that
wallaby, properly prepared (it needs prepar-
ing immediately), is a choice food. When at
work in the Burragorang valley, a few years ago,
I used to often shoot a rock-wallaby, skin and
clean him at once, put the hind-quarters in brine
for the night, and next day roast, stew, or curry
him. There were a dozen men at the camp, ail
with the usual navvy’s contempt for any meat
but beef or mutton, but after tasting my messes
of pottage they quickly became converts to wal-
laby. And the padymelon is still more tooth-
some. As for “Jailor’s” praises of goanna-tail,
the man who could eat it after seeing one of these
reptiles crawl out of the interior of a week-dead
horse would enjoy carrion-crow as an addition to
his menu.
EXACT GEOGRAPHY.
“ Can you — ah—tell us where we are?”
“ This 'ere’s the Nine-mile.”
“ Yes — ah—but nine miles from where"”
“ Oh, jes’ nine mile past the Six-mile, and three
mile this side of the Eight-mile water-’ole.”
“ Huniula ” : I am in the very trough of
the great bush tires, and here not one pound of the
Relief Fund reached the sufferers until two months
had elapsed. All that while the wretched settlers
were huddled together under the single roof of a
burnt-zinc humpy, starving, or in tents or bark
huts ; in a great many cases living on the charity
of neighbors who have only crusts to share. When
the actual distribution was made, the sufferers
were commanded to travel as much as 00 miles to
receive a catechising and £5 or £lO. Fences,
grass, logs, houses—all licked up. Where the
dwelling-house was saved you can see the evidence
of the fight in the charred parts of the house ; in
many cases, the bare cottage stands up stark,
stripped clean of surrounding fences, outhouses,
etc. Up at Carabost 200 cattle were roasted in
two heaps, and mingled with them were kanga-
roos, dingoes, foxes, hares, etc.—all friends there.
Very many animals died without a mark exter-
nally ; but. opened up, they showed lung substance
and throats partially roasted. And now facing us
is a drought !

“ D. 8.” : I am strongly of opinion that the
marriage of a white woman with an Asiatic
be made illegal in Australia, and I would punish
with penal servitude the white woman convicted
of cohabiting with an Asiatic. Such measures
might not altogether prevent the pollution of our
white blood, but they should at least abolish the
crying evil of young white women ministering to
the vices of the yellow brutes.

“Bindi ”: Re lightning effects. I have
known a flash knock down a whole team of 28 bul-
locks ; also the teamster’s horse and
dog; yet only four of the bullocks
were killed.
THE SAFETY OF GENERALI-
SATION.
TEACHER : “ What had David in his
mind when he said ‘All men are liars’!”
SMART BOY : “S'pose he thought it safer than
picking out one and calling him a liar.”
“A.L.M.H.”: Have been camping for
some time in the haunts of the bull-dog ant, and
conclude that he is a much-maligned beast. At
first we hunted wildly round for his happy home,
eager to dose it with kerosene and hot water, but
failed to find it, and have become quite reconciled
to the insect’s presence at meal times. When left
alone, the bull-dog ant is peaceable and depreca-
tory, and always backs off when disturbed, cover-
ing his retreat with a formidable pair of mandibles
agape. We used to kill him at a large rate at
first, but grew somewhat sick of seeing the bull-
dog we had considered slain at early morn walking
off into the dewy eve on four legs, minus his
abdomen. He takes too much killing, so we now
leave him alone. He reciprocates, and armed
neutrality prevails. The ant that really possesses
devils is the jumper, about a third less in size than
the bull-dog, and able at need to progress by
leaps of about nine inches, though he generally
runs like any common ant. A bull-dog bites and
hangs on till slain, but a jumper bites in fourteen
places at once, and dies luting the atmosphere
with unabated fury. When you go to put a heavy
hoof upon him, he springs at your trouser leg, and
commences operations before you have time to
think.

“ Mum ” : Would the Maoriland rata
grow in drought-cursed Australia? Was as dry
as a tin-idol-on-wheels, with
a bushman, on top of the
Tokateas once. The bush-
man in question cut a 3ft.
length of rata vine and
applied it to my mouth,
thick end downwards. Re-
sult, a cool, refreshing
drink. Next cut down a
nikau palm (gross vandal-
ism', removed the outer
skins of the trunk, and we
browsed upon a white sub-
stance ; taste, a cross be-
tween raw cabbage and
banana. Cooked, it is a
splendid substitute for cab-
bage. Rata juice is used
by the Maoris as a gentle
aperient; flax sap (boiled)
as a purgative. The rata,
a parasite in all things,
gathers to itself any mois-
ture within a few yards,
and if planted in dusty
Australia might, after rain,
keep the wet near the
surface.
“ Bon ” : Utter stagnation exists in nearly

Yet 12 years ago, when borrowed money was flow-
ing m. and the wool-growing business, not having
met with a real drought, had not found its real
level, Warren was the most prosperous town of its
size in N.S.W. It was then frequented by the
squattocracy of the biggest wool-growing district
of the west, and merrily went on the knocking-
down of cheques at the local pubs. To-day the

“ W.J.B.’: Was told by a Queenslander
that when she played the piano in the evening a
big green frog would come from behind a hanging
picture and sit on top of the piano. Did this
every evening for a month. Then he disappeared
—probably taken by a snake. He showed no out-
ward sign of preference for any particular kind of
music ; but once, during the playing of a lively
march, he jumped on to the keys—whether in
protest or approval, who shall say ?
“ D.H.R.” : Wuz crossin’ a droughty
tract once,’ an’, after a long, dry ride, come to a
deserted shanty with an iron tank sunk in tne
ground. There wuz a drop ’er slime, or water,
or somethin’ at ther bottom, but there wuz no
’ole, on’y at ther top er ther tank, where the
lid come out of, an’ no pint or string to
dip. I looks at it fer awhile, but bein
powerful thirsty, clumbed through the**
’ole into ther tank. It wuz water surer
’nuff ; an’ I wuz havin’ a lovely drink,
when ther tank gets dark quite sud-
den an’ I looks up. An’ there s me
ole neddy with his ’ed in the tank
stuck through the ’ole. ’E must
’er smelt the water. I give, a
shout an’ smacks‘’is nose. ’E
pulls like ’ell; but the tank
was deep in ther ground,
and ’stead er gettin’ ’is
'ed free, or pullin’ up
ther tank, ’e sticks fast.
We stopped like that
ther whole evernin’,
the ’orse lookin’ at me,
an’ me lookin’ at ther
’orse; me shoutin’ an’
cussin’ at intervals, the
old 'orse snortin’ when
I cussed. Then it be-
gan to get dark, an’ I
see somethin’ ’ad to be
done. We wuz miles
from ’elp an’ right out
er ther road. ‘‘lt’s
one of us,” I said at
last; so I took out me
knife an’ cut ther poor
ole neddy’s throat. It
took me most er ther
night to ’ack ’is ’ed off,
for it never was much
of ’er knife, an’ it got that
blunt ’fore long—’strewth !
Ther moke’d cost me ten

But then I never ’ad no

“ Combo ” : Was recently lis-
tening to two sheep-dog liars
No. 1 once owned a dog that would, on a hot day, to
save his voice, turn tail and scratch up dust at sheep
to wheel them. No. 2 had a dog that, when the sheep
came up to a gate, would, at the rear of the nock, jump
up on the backs of nearest sheep and canter across them
to the gate and open it from the sheep’s back.

“Smith” : Be the closing of entrance of
insect residences. Ground spiders do this most
effectually. This spider’s abode has a circular
shaft about Sin. deep, with a bottom-drive of same
length. The nest-top has a hinged lid about the
size of a shilling, made of mud, which is so well
made and so closely resembles its surroundings,
that when shut it 'baffles detection. When the
spider is foraging the lid is left open ; but on the
approach of an enemy or of rain it is promptly
closed-to.

“War. E.” : Many years ago there came
to a Murrumbidgee station a new manager who
always wore glasses ; and the shepherds were awe-
stricken when he counted out sheep “hurdle-
wide.” There was much speculation as to whether
he did it by “ twos ” or “ threes,” or even “ tens.”
Finally an old shepherd pronounced. “Them ’ere
glasses wot he wears is magneefyin’ glasses, an’
they makes a sheep the size of a bullick ; an’ any
blanker could count bullicks goin’ through
hurdle-wide.” Explanation accepted nem. con.

Jil: But about the dreariest of functions is a
doctors’ dinner. Doctors talk shop as they eat—discuss
poisons with the soup, post-mortems with the game, and
gall-stones with the sweets. Also, they won’t tell of the
“humorous ways they have been ‘had.’” They’re
too frightened that the other fellow would repeat
them as instances of Dr. Z.’s stupidity..—

Subject done with J.D.M. : Hut the Federal Parlia-

Parliaments put together have done in the past seven

anity was never meant to be literally what Christ taught.
Supposing that is agreed to, and your definition of the
Christian’s duty as “ altruism ” accepted, does that get
the modern church out of the reproach of being un-
christian? Do the modern churches preach or practise
altruism ? Do they denounce the sweater, the rack-renter
and the monopolist? Or do they give them front pews?

James Edmond, writing from Agra, gives
some idea of Indian architecture :
I have been seeing more tombs. This is the most tomb-
ful country on earth. The average course of a tour in
India is like this :
Leave Dogpore at night and change at Horsepore,
arriving at Beastpore early in the morning. Rushed by
three hotel touts in the early gloom, also: by four coolies
wanting to carry baggag'e. Select hotel. live coolies
seize baggage. If there isn’t a bit for each, two will help
to carry one small package. By the time we reach a
carriage coolies have increased to eight, with more
arriving. Trv to sort out the original coolies and giie
them two annas (2d.) each. Drive off, followed by cries
from ten more coolies, who swear they were all the
original article. , ,
Reach hotel, and am grovelled to. Have hot bath
(water brought in buckets by bheestie, or water-carrier),
MISS MINNA PHILLIPS (ns Glory Quayle)—
the Australian actress , who has been play ivy
leading parts in the American theatres, and
shortly returns to Australia.
and have breakfast. Go forth to explore native city.
Principal streets about four yards wide ; no pavements—
simply mud or dust mixed with garbage. Lined with
shops, which are recesses in the house walls about the
size of piano-cases. Value of stock vaiies from 16s. 2d.
to £2. Myriads of shops, with from one to four
dirty men looking after each. Profit apparently
about 3d. per day for each nartner. If you try to buy
something with 2d. the whole force of the firm is mobilised
to help to sell it, and a crowd gathers round to see the
operation. Street almost blocked by cooking-stoves, at
which the native who doesn’t know the delights of a home
(the counterpart of the one who, in America, lives at an
hotel) is buying meals for half-a-fartliing. Camels,
bullock-carts, sacred bulls, loose cattle, sheep, dogs,
gharries (cabs), smells, naked children, fountains, temples,
tombs, and sundries. Give 2d. to the leper to keep away.
Give 2d. to the deformity who rushes at me on
all fours in order to encourage him to be remote.
Smoke hard to mitigate smell. Get back to hotel to
have whisky. On way back pas 3 45 women lamenting at
a funeral. Also mill where women grind corn with two
horizontal stones ; they get 2d. for about 12 hours’ work,
and it isn’t worth more. See also sheep (single sheep)
being shorn in middle of street. One man holds the head
of the sheep. Another holds the tail. Another cuts the
wool. Another gives advice. Three more look on. It
would drive an Australian pastoralist mad with rage.
Afterwards drive three or five or ten miles to see the
tomb of Blank Shah. Pass many tombs by the way-
square or octagonal stone buildings large enough to make
good four-roomed dwelling, with domed roofs. Beach
tomb of Blank Shah. Find it enclosed with great wall,
two miles in circumference. Inside, magnificent garden,
and a huge gate at each side—the gate being an archway
with an immense building like a cathedral round it.
Barabbas, the guide, grovels at the gate, and points out
the Persian inscriptions, the marble ornaments, the
marble lattice-work, &c. Go lip great stone staircase, in
the bowels of the building, on to a vast terrace. Another
building rising' from the terrace. Go up more stairways
on to a smaller terrace, and find domes and towers rising
from that. Go up towers, and see vast extent of country
dotted over with tombs that stand up amid the crops 01
amid the dust where there are no crops. Go down aga.r.
and pay Barabbas, who grovels. Here endeth the gateway.
Walk a quarter of a mile over a paved walk 20 yards
wide, amid fountains and magnificent gardens, to wheie
the tomb of Blank Shah rises like ten cathedrals in the
centre. Gehazi, the next guide, abases himself. Select
one out of a dozen stairs, and go up 35 steep steps to a
terrace acres in extent. Terrace cost £170,000 or £200,000.
Go through a huge arched and sculptured doorway
to marble room with a dome 87 feet high and see
tombs of Blank Shah and his wife, the Sultana
Blank, in centre. The 99 names of God or the 198 names
of the Devil (I forget which) are done in Persian writing
on tomb. Jeypore marble all round. Gehazi, the guide,
tells how the tombs were all crusted with precious stones
till the g'reat conqueror, Nadir Shah, came out of Persia
and looted the lot. (I haven’t seen a tomb yet which
Nadir Shah hadn’t looted ; also, he took the Peacock
Throne, worth £0,009,000, from Delhi, and the gold and
silver doors, and the silver roofs, and the coin. He must
have been a man worth knowing.) Around the great
central department are other vaulted apartments in
marble containing the tombs of Blank Shah’s sons, daugh-
ters, grand-daughters, mother-in-law, grand-vizier, and
his uncle’s dog. This lot cost £750,000.
Go up a staircase that cost £lO,OOO on to a ter‘ace
(which cost £250,000) above the tombs. On it are a job
lot of marble towers, domes and minarets that cost
£150,000. Go up a tower and see more tombs in the dis-
tance. Wall round the tomb area cost £300,000. Gardens
cost a barrow-load of money and have been kept up for
300 years at a cost of a dray-load of money. And every
city I have met so far seems to have from one to six of
these tombs. If only one emperor had sold his tomb
and bought a clean, decent city with the money, what a
country this might have been !
Next day go to see the palace of Blank Shah. Wall
round it like a fortress—a mile of wall. Inside a wilder-
ness of court-yards, lawns, fountains, and marble build-
ings that consist mostly of an expensive 'roof and an
ocean of marble pillars. Have explored nine palaces, and
in them all can hardly find a place where Blank Shah
could sit down out of public view. And these palaces are
worth a steady average of £500,000 or £1,000,000 each.
I have struck six ruined cities and two abandoned ones.
At one of the latter (Amber) the potentate got tired of
the £1,000,000 palace, and built another city and another
palace, and shifted the population. The other city—
Futtehpore Sekri was never occupied. The usual
£L,000,000 palace was built, and the town was being built
when Akbar died and became only a body, and then
nothing more happened.
There are innumerable ruined Hindu temples here-
abouts that must have been worth a steady average of
£150,030 each. If .your guide is a Hindu, he is so broken
up about their desecration that he won’t stop weeping for
less than 4d.
All these ruins get on my nerves. I’m sorry Nadir
Shah, the Persian looter, is dead.

When King Onion, of Bunbury, died,
Whitey Brown George went up to the lock-up to
see if he could release his mother, Fanny, who had
been run in for drunkenness. To the officer m
charge he said : “King Onion die along-a camp
this morning ; you bin let I anny out, Muster
O’Oonnor ’ ” “ Indade I’ll not,” said the con-
stable. “ Then who the said Whitey
Brown George, “is going to do the cryin ?
Albert Dorringfcon describes how he col-
lected an account
If Japan is as smart in facing her accounts as some of
her people it will take the combined efforts of the
British and American fleets to collect the war-loan
interest when it falls due. , T
Our firm had a mortgage on Yoshino s lugger, and so 1
climbed aboard at 2 p.m. to collect £l6 10s. A black-
toothed Tonquinese, with an unmentionable face,
snarled at me from the deck-house ; and I gathered
from his Franco-Chinese yabber that Yoshino was asleep
below, and must not be disturbed. , , . ,
I waited. An old pump whined in the for ard stench,
and the sun stayed like the hand of a devil on my neck.
There was no awning on that lugger, and the shell
fumes drifted into my eyes.
At 4 p.m. Tonquin looked at me from the hold. 1
urged him to wake Yoshino. “Sixteen pound ten,” I
added, feelingly. .
Heard voices below; the mellifluous voices of Japan.
Weltered through another hour, while Tonquin held
guard over the stair-head. Then slowly and limply
Yoshino came on deck. There were sea-sores on his
black arms ; his neck was puffed and swollen, as though
he had been gasping in ocean slime for unnumbered
years. He bowed gravely ; then, as an after-thought, he
shook my hand warmly. I left the account in liis shut
Yoshino regarded me with favor ; then he asked if my
father was quite well. , .
1 repl’e l that the old man had gone fishing, and that
hundreds of people would openly rejoice if lie never re-
turned. I mentioned the £lO 10s. in my best voiee.
Yoshino b amed. He suggested that a certain weari-
ness in my face indicated illness among my family, lie
asked earnestly if my mother was quite well.
1 said it would take £l6 10s. to complete her cure. I
then requested him not to make cigarettes with the
account.
He smiled like Howard Vernon. He begged me not to
be offended. He then asked me to state definitely how
many brothers I had.
I told him 16, and that 10 were married. He looked
grieved. At this point I cast myself upon his pity, add-
ing that unless the account was collected promptly I
would be dismissed and degraded.
Yoshino began to look sulky ; he nodded several times
to the Tonquinese. I looked carelessly at_ the blue
expanse of water, and tried to count the pigmy crew
swarming suddenly about me.
Herewith Yoshino told me, sharply, that I had not
satisfied him concerning the health of my family. He
said I was not a good son.
The Tonquinese ripped a shell-bag in halves with a
swift, murderous knife ; he glanced at Yoshino, and then
regarded me steadily.
“ I’ll call next Wednesday,” I said, humbly. Any
time between Wednesdays will do.”
Yoshino followed me to the lugger’s si le, bowing and
smiling. Thrusting a sore hand into his shirt, he pro-
duced a sheet of coupon-like paper.
“ This is as good as money,” he remarked, pleasantly.
“ They will change at the hotel. You give receipt now-
yon give receipt now.”
The Tonquinese showed me his nine teeth. I gave the
receipt.
Ashore, I presented the tickets, representing £l6 10s.,
to the hotel landlady. She blushed furiously, and walked
away.
Puzzled, I asked mine host to inspect them. He
grinned, and told me not to lose heart. “ You see, this
coast is full of Japanese ladies, and this ticket thing
represent money among the Manila boys, Kanakas, and
Japs. Don’t know how the bank is worked ; but every-
body’s satisfied. Any of the shelters will pay you cash
for them.”
The captain of a black-pearler took them. He charged
me £4 exchange.
Dooley, landlord of the Swinglebar Hotel,
could neither read nor write, and his desire to hide
the deficiency was sometimes played upon by
sharpers. One day a man came in and asked
Dooley for “ that two quid.” “What two quid ? ”
says Dooley. “ Why, that two quid you laid me
on the Melbourne Cup.” “ t laid you no two
quid” says Dooley. “Well, I’m Mowed !” said
the other producing a letter. “ Isn’t that your
handwriting, Mr. Dooley.” “ Begob, it is, me
bhoy,” admitted Dooley ; “I’ll pay you the two
pound.”
ON THE LANE COVE RIVER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Do you remember how the sunset burned
Behind black-barring trees in gold and rose,
And how the rippled waters glowed and greyed
And darkened dully ? Where the river flows
About the point shadowed by light beyond,
Like scattered petals shining in the gloom
The waves were flushed. The warm night conscious giew
Of thick sown stars. We watch them bloom,
Fire-flowers trembling deep within the stream,
And, in a fantasy, stretch down to reach
And pluck such marguerites to our sweet use
Of telling once again how each loved each.
Then with the selfsame thought your eyes met mine—
“ This little depth reflects all space above,
No longer doubt. To this, a human heart,
Is given to hold the infinite ; I love.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
jST.S.W. Premier Carruthers talks of Upper
House reform. Any reform, short of abolition,
should include deprivation of the power of
absolute veto.
Yic. Premier Bent gives out that his Govt,
will shortly consider the question of abolishing
the Vic. Full Court as a court of appeal, and
sending appeals straight up to fhe High Court.
In the cause of economy why not have the
Government land sales in the cities conducted by
Government officials as is the case in country
districts when the land agent acts as auctioneer ?
Sydney D.T. speaks contemptuously of
the “anti-loan fever” which has “seized the
Federal Parliament.” Rough on the community
when the makers of its public opinion look upon
honesty as an ailment and paying one’s way as a
disease!
A notable conversion of last week was that
of the Argus to Socialism. Extract from its
leader on the telephone systems :
~Bn America the telephones are privately owned, and big
“Corporations have, no doubt, to get their corrupt “ pulls ”
out of the people. It does not correspond to our public
system, which is worked by the Government for the
people.
Old-man Seddon still keeps a grip on the
essentials of statesmanship. He has found that
Maoriland imports from U.S.A. £210,000 worth
of canned fruit a year. That he says must stop,
and by a tariff revision and setting up State
canning factories he will see that the country
produces its own canned fruit.
Giving evidence to the Tariff Commission,
Air. John Barnett, clothing manufacturer, said
that the Customs Act provision against the im-
portation of goods made by gaol labor was practi-
cally a dead-letter. He knew that a good deal of
prison-made clothing came to Australia ; it could
not be detected by the Customs.
It being alleged that there is a London
shipping ring strong enough to kill all outside
competition, however powerful, Sydney I).T.
comments:—
If that is so, it simply proves how absurd it is for the
Government to pretend that it can fix a price and get the
service at that figure.
In other words, it is absurd of the Federal
Government to resist any attempt to rob Aus-
tralia !
THE RETORT DISCOURTEOUS.
SQUASHED LITTLE PARTY : "Now, then, look out,
d'ye want to throw me off the tram?”
LARGE PARTY : “No, I don’t. But if I did I
could.”
Discussing the ‘ mail subsidy question the
Tory papers are freely quoting as “George
Turner’s opinion ” that the loss on exchange by
lack of a'weekly mail will be near to £250 000 a
year. What Mr. Turner did say on the subject
was that an estimated loss of £50,000 a year was
absurd—absurdly high. His opinion seems to be
that when things settle down there won’t be any
loss at all.
In thousands of M.L. homes and on scores
of platforms, the late George Fisher, M.H.R. and
social wreck, was the most telling argument for
prohibition. M.L. had a'chrious affection for him.
“And, poor fellow, ” it always said, “he can’t
help it. The State must put it out of his reach.”
His life made more converts than his speech—and
there was a time when he could speak.
The “On the Land ” man of the S.M.
Herald says that “fears are expressed that it
may be deemed necessary to first refer the Barren
Jack irrigation work to the Public Works Com-
mittee.” Some people do seem very anxious to
dodge a, public inquiry into that and other pro-
posals in connection with Murrumbidgee irriga-
tion. The matter is worth watching.
Among the last batch of worn-out Chinese
despatched from Ballarat (Vic.) by the Benevolent
Society to mingle their bones with those of their
ancestors, was one who left behind him a wife in
an inebriate home, one son in a reformatory,
another an epileptic, and two daughters, 12 and 8
years, who with their youngest brother, were
charged by the police as neglected. They were all
thrust on to the State’s free list. Advance
Australia!
The Bent Government’s refusal to recipro-
cate with N.S. W. in paying old-age pensions was
to have been expected, and is, perhaps, seeing the
sort of administration there is in Victoria, a
matter for congratulation. States having old-age
pension laws would, if at all friendly to the pen-
sion idea, gladly reciprocate where the applicant
has put in the full statutory time, part in one
State and part in another. But Mr. Bent is dis-
tinctly unfriendly to old-age pensions.
The Lands Commission sitting in various
parts of M.L. to take evidence concerning tenures
is having a good time. It started business in
Southland, and it wasn’t long before it was lost.
After about a fortnight somebody dug it up at
Stewart Island, where the oysters come from, and
Richard Seddon sent a telegram loaded with much
explosive language to the effect that he wanted
its report for the coming session. The Com-
mission reluctantly tore itself away from the
oyster-leases.
Bishop Pain, of Gippsland (Vic.), has
joined the Stinking-fish party. Recent speech
Mr. Lynch was going to a land where he would have to
hear what the English people thought of the “six
hatters ” case, the “ Petriana ” case, tne exclusion of the
two Maoris, the dislocated mail service, and the manner
in which the natives of this country were treated in
West Australia. He would, however, be able to tell
them that the great majority of the people of this country
repudiated the responsibility for these things, and that
they earnestly wished that such wrongs might be righted
as soon as possible.
So Mr. Lynch, who is one of Bishop Pain’s clergy,
is prompted to go to England to give another fillip
to lying myths which have been exploded in Aus-
tralia. Some of these myths were mere election-
eering slanders in the first place; now, years
almost after they have served their bad purpose,
a reverend bishop encourages his parsons to go
abroad and spread them in new places.
The manager of London Daily Chronicle,
travelling through Adelaide, stated to an inter-
viewer that Australian affairs were treated
by the British press in proportion to
their news-value to English readers.
His paper instituted a <k Greater
Britain ” column, but had to drop
it, as the Londoner cares little
and knows less of Australia.
This is something for Aus-
tralian K.C.M.-Geese and
other Australian stinking-
fish parties to remember.
They might drop playing
Ike to the gallery if they
were sure the gallery
was empty. Then they
might keep their
minds on Australia,
instead of conjuring up
absurd visions of Bri-
tain being wildly
disturbed by our legis-
lation.
The encourage-
ment that manufac-
turers ask for is
nothing compared
with what “the man
on the land,” the
Freetraders’ friend, is
for ever demanding.
A request has just
been made to the
Westralian Agricul-
tural Department for
£3OO towards an egg-
laying competition !
The Westralian hen
already has the benefi t
of the finest tempor-
ary market in the
Commonwealth the
goldfields— and yet
she wants more. And,
since the Westralian
Govt; already has a defi-
cit, any encouragement given
by the Treasury would have to be
out of loans. To use Cohen’s nose to
edge the hen on to action, and then call
the egg a permanent and reproductive under-
. taking, would take things further than even Tas-
mania left them.
Very, slowly but very steadily an in-
dependent Labor Party is being hatched in M.L.
by the untiring efforts of John Bigg, labor member
in the Legislative Council. Premier Seddon
doesn t like it and told some of its representatives
recently that they were wasting their time.
“Haven’t you got Me!” he demanded. The
representatives plucked up enough courage to
inform the Son of "Empire that lie was'one of the
birds they were out to shoot, and then fled while
the old man broke the furniture.
The private Customs Court established by
ex-Minister Lyne, where the swindling importer
can have his case dealt with, mostly by deputy,
without having to rub shoulders, as at the police
court, with drunks and shop-lifters, seems to be
doing such a business lately that the only possible
deduction is that the fines are not nearly heavy
enough. One “court” in Melbourne last week
inflicted penalties of from £1 to £2 10s. for mis-
description, etc. (always on the wrong side). If
the offender is caught only once in every half-
dozen times, fines of this sort merely act as an
inducement to him to keep on mis-describing.
Blue-stocking girls regard the degree of
D.C.L. as a passport to the realms of intellectual
superiority. But smart men know D.C.L. whisky
as the passport to mental power, and success. To
illuminate the*brain to the D.C.L. degreeship
point, or beyond, it is necessary to drink D.C.L.
whisky wisely, and with good intent.*
AN INTRODUCTION.
Japan may now rank as a first-class power. —Daily
paper.
Australian supporters of Asiatic exclusion may find in-
convenient and disconcerting' the new assertiveness which
Jap successes will probably arouse in Asiatic nations.—
Daily paper.
JOHN BULL: “ This, my son, is the new first-
class power. He's the soul of honor and
generosity. You need have no fear of him—
as long as you don't offend him.”
A Whangarei (M.L.) deputation to the
Premier wanted a new gaol. “The present one
was not fit to pat a pig in.” Mr. Seddon thought
such a law-abiding community should not require
a gaol at all. The deputation argued that all
the law-breakers came e.ther from B’Africa or
Australia. “ Well, let it be known that your gaol
is not fit to put a pig in, and those people will
stay away,” said the Premier, slyly, and the
deputation retired without the promise of a gaol.
One of the brazen-faced shires of Victoria
—Upper Yarra—tackled Premier Bent lately with
a few modest demands that staggered even that
seasoned jobber. Mr. Bent bellowed out that
they were asking about £25,000 a year, and,
as their municipal rate was only Is. 3d., he would
give them nothing. Then, after bullying for a
space, he promised them £lOOO a year to go on
with. Mr. Bent with the Kyabramapootras is
like the fond and foolish mother who, when her
youngster demands the whole of a bag of lollies,
publicly threatens to knock its head off ; in the
long run the infant gets the lollies and keeps its
head. And it knows all along that the threat is
only “talk.”
Over 40 properties have been offered to
Bent for his contemplated Inebriates Retreat and
Receiving House. Now's the time for the old
boom builders ! Most Melb. suburbs have relics
of the Boom horror in the shape of “palatial
mansions,” gorgeously built on ridiculously small
allotments, now lying neglected and crumbling to
decay. Some of these white elephants (which are
eating their heads oif in rates and taxes) have
never even been furnished —no sane family would
be likely to tackle the job. So when hospitals
and other buildings are contemplated by the
Government, the haste with which the despairing
agents and owners of “eligible properties,” tumble
over each other in their anxiety to get at the
Government is fearful.
Premier Bent, at a commercial smoke
concert, last week, gave a hint of his intentions
regarding the Factories Act, which must be
renewed presently. “He was one of those,” he
said, “ who believed we had gone too far in this
Shops and Factories Act; under it very few
opportunities presented themselves to enable
people to get apprentices.” Yet, section 7of the
Act distinctly declares that an employer may take
as many .apprentices as he pleases , provided only
he binds them and himself for not less than three
years and teaches them the trade. Mr. Bent must
have known tnat, and he no doubt knew that it
is not apprentices that the sweating employer
wants, but the right to employ an unlimited
number of boys at the lowest possible wage, with
the right to sack them directly they want arr
increase. It seems, too, that’s what Bent is
preparing to give them.
Bombastes Bent has put his 4x9 foot in-it
again, by declaring h;s determination not t* pay
the compensation money to the closed North
Melbourne publicans Until the Hayes versus Hunt
slander- action is settled. • Hunt is a.local cold-
water and weak-tea specialist, and Mrs. Hayes is
a North Melbourne publican, who holds that he
has libelled her. Bent gives as his plea for with-
holding the money the extremely dunder-headed
excuse that Hunt has only said what he (Bent)
said in stronger language. Which is neither
reason nor excuse, and Bent shoukl'be made to
answer for what looks like a blatant and stupid
attempt to interfere with a sub judice case. The
compensation is awarded, and this action cannot
affect it, and Bent, in refusing to pay up on such
a plea, is doing the complainant what mischief he
can with the opportunities at hand. Tommy’s
peculiar aptitude for making a good cause smell
like a ton of last week s fish is impressing itself
upon the somewhat tough Victorian conscience.
Even the most exalted politicians who at-
tend the Turkish Baths prove by the impedimenta
they shed that they are decidedly of the earth
earthy. Constant Turkish Bathing should do
much to make politics cleaner. ‘ ‘ Oh, yes,” say the
many medicos who attend (Daly’s new baths, at
the Melbourne Royal Arcade,' “we always re-
commend the baths, especially to politicians, and
trust they may improve their principles as well as
themselves.”*
Victorian Lands
Department, look-
ing round to see-
what territory it
had suitable for
closer settlement,
remembered that
there were several
thousands of acres
lying between Wes-
tern-port and Wil-
son’s Promontory.
But, on a second
look, it found that
the land wasn’t
available, because-
one of the last offi-
cial acts of J. W.
Taverner, when
Lands Minister, was
to let it on 21 years
leases. The revenue
derived by the State
is scarcely worth
bothering about
most of the lessees
are Melbourne per-
sons, who never go-
near their leases;
and in many cases
nothing has been
done to the land
that hasn’t been
absolutely neces-
sary to get over
the -improvement
conditions. In.
short, the trail of
the shepherd is over
it all.
The Bulletin
is glad to hear this
from Davo River
Downs (Q.): Shear-
ing is progressing
here. A meeting
was convened the
other day, when
this resolution was.
passed: “That the
Labor party should
adopt a definite
fiscal policy, and that the A.W.U. should proceed,
to obtain a plebiscite of all members and Labor
supporters. In our opinion a highly Protective-
policy would be the most beneficial to Australia."
Secretary Dugan, of the N.S.W. Marble
and Slate • Workers’ Union, in giving evidence
before the Arbitration Court, recently, quoted
the following as to the importations of marble and
wrought slate into this State :
Wrought. Unwrought.
1302 - .. £8479 .. £12,990
1904 .. 9815 .. 3,200
This shows increased use of local marble. Mr.
Dugan, who speaks from over 20 years’ experience,
pronounces the local colored marble superior to
the imported colored marble, and says that it has
come into demand by leaps and bounds during the
last two years.
Mr. J. Russell French, president of
N.S.W. Institute of Bankers, in his inaugural
address for 1905, denounced “Socialism” with
extra violence. Mr. Russell French (whose bank,
by the way, since the advent of the Labor party,
has been flourishing like the bay-tree) has put in
much of his time lately trying to urge the State to
pay £140,000 a year, or anything else that is
asked, in order that his English letters won’t have
to wait a week occasionally. Mr. Russell French
didn’t complain audibly either when the State
recently presented his bank with a huge sum,
by remitting rents on its western division
properties.
THE REASON OF THE DELAY.
GENT : “Hurry up with my chicken!”
WAITER : “ All right, sir; if I get another order
for chicken the loss says he'll kill it.”
The Board appointed by Vic. Premier
Bent to administer the Land Resumption Act has
announced its intention of acting in a “sym-
pathetic ” way. Don’t doubt the statement for a-
moment. Judged by its personnel, the Board can
be relied on to deal most sympathetically with the-
land monopolist.
- ... ,
Tha Tab ragalba Estate, Queensland.
This important, sale, which we have been advertising for
some weeks past, takes place on the 22nd April (Easter
Saturday.) There is not the slightest doubt that a great
advantage accrues to a person who can in a practically
new d.strict obtain five or six acres, or even more, at the
price of one acre here when considering the advanced
condition of local methods as compared with that of the
Queensland Dairy Farmers. As is well-known first class
land within fifty miles of Melbourne or Sydney is in many
cases worth upwards of £lOO per acre, and at similar dis-
tances from Brisbane from £5 to £lO per acre, and in the
latter district it is rising daily. The Tabragalba Estate
has already been inspected by numerous Southerners,
and in all cases the highest opinions have been formed of
its wonderful fertility and great suitability for dairy
farming, lamb raising, etc. Any person not having
received a copy of the illustrated plan of the Estate can
obtain same by applying to the Local Agents for tha
Estate, or Messrs. Isles, Love and Co., Auctioneers,
Brisbane.*

Another Case of Tumor
Doctors Advise Instant Operation.
VITADATIO
HAS REMOVED IT.
Read what MR. ARSCOTT writes.
Deal' Sir,—l think VITADATIO worthy of great praise as
a genuine remedy. It has saved me a few pounds
expenses in doctors and medicine. My wife had a tumor
on her neck, causing her much pain and alarm. The
doctors, when consulted, advised instant operation—there
being danger in delay—but my wife shrinking from this,
we consulted a herbalist, who wanted 6 guineas per
quarter for an indefinite period to remove the disease.,
VITADATIO was then brought under our notice, and we
resolved to try it. By the time the fourth large bottle
was used the'tumor had come right away, leaving only
a mark on the neck where it had been. There has been
no return of the trouble, and my wife has enjoyed good
health since. You are welcome to use this as you please,
I am so satisfied with what VITADATIO has done for my
wife.

Premier Bent, to a Melbourne audience,
the other night:
As he had previously stated he was strongly opposed
to the Arbitration Act, especially as applied to public
servants. If the public servants, including the railway
men, insisted on doing- a certain thing, as he anticipated,
he would oppose them. He was simply retaining- the
position of Minister for Railways, because he believed
there would be a demand in this direction before long,
and he would oppose it. If he had anv power he would
not allow it.
Mr. Bent of course refers to the possible registra-
tion of the Victorian railway unions under the
Federal Arbitration Act. It is characteristic of
the man that he makes no pretence of concealing
his intention of setting himself up as above the
Federal law.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The luck of the promoters was right in over the
final of the Si'dney Thousand. After a day of showers
came a night humid but fine, and the people poured out
to the Sydney Cricket Ground. It was not the crowd
that went to see the 1904 Thousand, but it was its younger
brother, and was bigger than anyone expected to see.
Before the race started the referee informed the men that
they were right up against it, and the shadow of anything
crooked meant that it would be declared a no-race. Every
man swore by his sprocket and his frame-head to run
straight. The pistol cracked, out went all the
lights but the greenish acetylene ones over the
track. Lear and Bestel, the front men, rushed
off at a tremendous speed. The scratch division
simply flew from the jump; they were evidently
determined to overtake their field in the first lap, breathe
the second, and fight it out between themselves in the
third. The second lap saw them running at top speed in
two divisions, seven in the front, four in the back. The
pacing was beautiful to watch ; they changed with the
regularity and precision of machinery, and so fast did the
front bunch reel away that it was only at the bell that
the scratch crowd, by splendid efforts," managed to over-
take them. Parley was done, and when the front-markers
again sprinted MacFarland burst, and Ellegaard and
Lawson were last and second last respectively. As
they came to the scoring board the crowd
waited to see Ellegaard dash away; he didn’t. Instead,
Lawson went nearly to the front, and then they
swept round, all bunched together. At the mem-
bers’ stand the front rankers were leading, and Ellegaard
and Lawson both came with a rush. There was no open-
ing to get through, and the two champions seemed to be
locked together, and the front-markers were rushing for
the spoil. An opening—like a flash Ellegaard was
through. Only ten yards to go—he leaped over it.
Horder’s light blue was in front, and higher up, slightly in
advance, the brown figure of Lear. Up the bank swept
the great Danish sprinter, and 30,000 people held their
breath. Would he do it? Could he do it? Then a
mighty roar as the pistol cracked, and Ellegaard was seen
yards in front of all. Everybody believed he had won.
He seemed to go right in front as the pistol cracked, but
it was his position high up the bank that made it appear
so. He was beaten by an inch or so, and Lear, the Vic-
torian, was first, Horder, the Cornstalk, second, and
Ellegaard third.
Lear, who won the Sydney Thousand, is a mere
youth, being only in his 21st year. He was the limit man
(on the 140yds. mark), and Ilorder, who was second, was
on the 90yds. But for the momentary blocking of Elle-
gaard and Lawson in the ruck, the Dane must have won.
Had there been another foot to go he would have won,
and it was a great and wonderful dash.
* * * *
It was left to Tasmania to defeat, for the only
time this season, a N.S.W. cricket eleven, the latter
State haying defeated during 1904-5 Victoria (four times),
S.A. (twice), and Bananaland twice, with lots to spare on
each occasion. It was no mean achievement for Tas-
mania, either, for the defeated side included Mackay,
Waddy, Johnston, Garnsey, and Carter, deemed good
enough to play against S.A., and several of the others
represented the State in its second eleven.
* * * *
The Melb. C.C., in its fight to retain control of
the cricket matches played in Australia against visiting
English teams, has been quick to seize upon the difference of
opinion as to whether players should have representation
on the board of control proposed to arrange the tours.
The N.S.W. and Vic. associations have discarded the pro-
posal, and South Australia has accepted it. The M.C.C.
has secured an authoritative statement from the players
now en route to England that they will play against any
teamthattheMclb.O.C.bringsout. Byimplication(though
careful not to say it outright), this is a veiled threat that
the players will not play against a visiting combination
brought out in opposition to the Melbourne body. Apart
from the fact that they are not picked yet, this attitude is
an unwise one for the players to take up. In a general flare-
up, should one unhappily eventuate, the public would
not stand a strike among the playing members.

In first-class cricket in Adelaide recently two of
Clem Hill’s brothers made 95 and 45 respectively. Clem,
same day, knocked up 129 in Maoriland.
* * *
During the Australian XI. tour of M.L. the
matches played were six, and of these four were won by
the Australians, and two were drawn much in favor of
Australia. And there has been no wild outbreak in any
Australian city. Not even Woolloomooloo has gone
off its head, as they do in Maoriland, when they send a
moderately successful football team abroad.
* * * *
To “Stakeholder” (Westralia) : Basing com-
parisons on their International Test Match records, M.A.
Noble is the greater cricketer of the two. Their records
to date are :
Batting.
Innings. N.O. Runs. 11. S. Average.
M.A. Noble.. 40 6 1157 133 34'29
G. Giffen .. 53 0 1238 101 23'35
Bowling.
Overs. Mdns. Runs. Wkts. Average.
M. A. Noble.. 807-4 256 2031 94 21 -60
G. Giffen .. 1065-1 434 2800 103 27T8
Withal, George Giffen kicked up a mighty dust as a
cricketer in his day. For years he stood at the head of
the list of bowlers, w'ho, put on in each innings, took eight
wickets for less than 10 runs apiece. He did it at Sydney
in 1895, when he sent down 125 balls (including eight
maidens), and got eight sets of sticks for 40 runs, an
average of s'oo. On another occasion he bowled in only
one innings, and, bowling 90 overs with seven maidens,
took five wickets for 26 runs, an average of 5-20. At
Sydney in Feb., ’92, he took 10 wickets in a match for
160 runs. Outside of averages, Noble seems to have a
shade the better by a comparison in grit. Remember his
display in that historic match which he pulled out of the
fire, by staying in hour after hour in the face of a brutal,
howling mob of North Englishmen, coolly stonewalling,
to turn a crushing defeat into a draw. It was a remark-
able exhibition of courage, and as an achievement stands
high in the records of cricket.

Maoriland Cricket Council strikes a loss of
about £l5O on those precious “Test” matches. The
provincial matches paid very well, but the Maorilanders
got tired of seeing their country pasted to the five corners
of the earth, and stayed away from the later matches
most religiously.
♦ * * *
Adelaide’s boy cricketer, C. E. Dolling, has
put up an astounding record this season. In six
matches he scored 915 runs for the loss of two wickets —
an average of 457 (needn’t worry about the decimals).
* * * *
Cricketer Poidevin, writing to an English
athletic paper, remarks: “It was thought that R. N.
Hickson, a young player of great hitting capabilities,
would on that account win a place in the (Australian XI.)
team. But a failure or two at an inopportune time seems
to have placed his chance of selection in the region of
remote possibility.” This would seems to indicate that
Mr. Poidevin understands the system on which the lords
of Australian cricket select their international teams. As
Mr. Poidevin is now in the cricket scribe way of business,
why doesn’t he explain that mystery ? It would make
most interesting copy. Most people are better acquainted
with the geography of the M’Donnell Ranges than with
what is necessary to obtain a place in an Australian
Eleven.
* * * *
Chiefly owing to the general weakness of Central
Cumberland, L. W. Pye did most work in N.S.W. first-
grade cricket during the season—l 392 balls, 42 wickets ;
average 19 - 38. Pye also scored 041 runs (average of 71.22),
being beaten only by Australian XI. champion M. A.
Noble. But, then, Noble didn’t score nearly 5s many runs
as Pye, andgmly took 25 wickets. Yet Pye couldn’t get a
place in inter-State cricket.
♦ * ■* *
During the progress of the match between the
Australian Eleven and Wellington (M.L.) Noble and
Cotter rose up and bowled words at each other. The
captain, one day, wanted Cotter to “rock’em in,” and
Cotter declined, and was taken off. Next day Noble
tossed the ball to him, and said, “ Go on with the wind,
and bowl fast —if you can ! ” Cotter bowled even slower
than on the previous day, whereupon the skipper took
him off for good. Cotter passed the time o’ day back,
and the grass was littered with compliments.
* * * *
The most noticeable feature of the just-finished
cricket tour (says a M.L. correspondent) was the large
quantity of Australian XI. wife.
♦ * * *
First centuries of the Australian XI. tour—Hill
(118) and Armstrong(l2o not out) in the first M.L. “ test ”

Sporty White Cliffs opal-field (N.S.W.) had a
day of strikes on the feast,of St. Patrick. Athletic sports
had been arranged, good nominations received, and all
the opal-gougers turned up. But when the competitors
and their trainers met a committee-man at the gates,
with a demand to part-up admission-money for trainers,
they struck, and proceedings were hung-up while they
argued the matter out. Finally, the committee gave in,
and then it struck to the extent of knocking out two
events. At this stage, the competitors decided to strike
some more ; whereupon the committee hastily assembled
and decided to strike the whole hog, and declared the
day’s sports off. Eleven fights followed.
* * * *
After spending considerable time listening to
counsel wrangling over the wrongs of one Quail Yik, the
Australian High Court has retired to consider the case in
private. This Chow was delivered up to the law on
March 30th, 1904, for selling a pak-a-pu ticket in Pitt-
street. The only laws broken by him in the sale were one
passed by George 111. and another by George IV., of
unhappy memory. Presumably Quail Yik had never
heard of either of the Georges or their laws. The host of
legal luminaries before whom the Chow has trembled are
mostly of opinion that the laws mentioned do not apply to
this country, wherefore Quan’s ignorance might be
excused. Anyhow, this country has troubles enough of
its own without being- afflicted by a general resurrection
of the Georges and their laws. If pak-a-pu is an objec-
tionable pastime to play in Pitt-street (and played as it is,
and by whom it is, there is no doubt it is objectionable
even in Pitt-street, or Wexford-street either), why not
pass a local Act to put it down ? If Parliament will not
pass such a law it is unjust, and against public policy, to
fall back on obsolete statutes. If this practice becomes
general, quite a number of very respectable gentlemen
will find themselves in gaol, including bank managers,
who will not allow men in their service to marry unless
they are receiving- a certain stipend. An obsolete Act,
which was never repealed, fixes the punishment for inter-
fering with the natural increase of the population as a
heavy fine and stocks for the first offence, mutilation and
gaol for the second, and something with three different
methods of dying in it for the third.
Although the sculling championship match is
still in the “ wrangle ” stage, Stanbury plugs away twice
a day on the Parramatta River, moving in something like
his old style. Towns does practically no rowing, but
goes on making boats and oars, principally for English
oarsmen. Stated on reliable authority that Stanbury is
testing- his dash, and if it is found that he can be got to
his old top-notch form, he will agree to the terms de-
manded by Towns. Stanbury’s backers (who include
most of those who lost money over Tressider) are anxious
that the match should be a certainty. But Towns doesn’t
want a match yet; and even should Stanbury agree to
terms, the race isn’t likely to come off before the Spring,
or perhaps later.
* * * *
The inter-State eight-oar championship is going
to produce the best race for many years—all the Aus-
tralian States being represented. The squabble in the
N.S.W. Rowing Association, and the strike of nearly all
the prominent members of the chosen team, has, however,
spoiled N.S.W. ’s chance; and the poorness of form dis-
played by the green team points to the fact that the
State wouldn’t be represented, except that the race will
take place on the Parramatta River.
* * * *
“ B.’ : There’s a deal of dissatisfaction amongst
amateur athletes because visiting cracks Duffev and
Shrubb are being allowed to compete in Austral cham-
pionships. It is not very encouraging to Australasian
athletes that world’s record-smashers are allowed to scoop
in the plums of the season from men who have put in
months of hard training. There are heaps of ways of per-
mitting the visiting athletes to show off their paces (by
special matches and scratch events), and if the N.S.W.
Athletic Association keeps the visitors out of champion-
ship events and caters for them in other ways, the sport
will be much benefited.
The much-tallced-of wrestling match between
Australian Harry Pearce and Maoriland Arthur Skinner
came off last week. The man who got the best of three
falls in Cumberland, Catch-as-catch-can, and Cornish
style was to be declared the winner. The Australian won
the Catch-as-catch-can and the Maorilander the Cumber-
land .style, and the Cornish final was postponed. Then
the referee said the men would wrestle for an hour and a
half, and if no falls were secured he would give his decision
on points. After 45 dreary minutes the Maorilander
secured a fall, but the referee disallowed it. Skinner threw
Pearce again, and this time scored ; Skinner became
presumptuous, and Pearce brought him down on his hip
and shoulder, but failed to score. This had a steadying
effect, and Skinner, although continuing on the aggres-
sive, tempered his enthusiasm with caution, and again
landed Pearce on his back. Time being up, the referee,
being unable to decide on points, ordered the men to
wrestle on for another ten minutes. It was a warm ten
minutes. Skinner attacked all he knew and brought
Pearce to his knees twice, and Pearce threw Skinner right
over once, but failed to score, and in the end it was given
as a draw.
* * * *
Without a doubt the upheaval of Keran during
the present season has been something astounding. Even
supposing the phenomenal success of Australian swimmers
is due to the short baths in which they put up their
records, the improvement in Keran’s form is little short
of marvellous. Pacing over and over again in the same
water, he repeatedly breaks his former records, and now
he owns and shares eight world records. The 880 yards
and the mile he owned last year. This year he knocked
18 3-ssec. off his 880 yards time, and lmin 19 2-ssec. off
the mile. Since February this year he has appropriated
and equalled the world’s record for the 200, 220, 300, 440,
500, 880, 1000 yards, and the mile. Now they want him
to go to England and show the boys there how to get
through the water.
» * * *
Transpires that young Dickenson, who t’otherday
won the half-mile handicap, and arranged to give record-
breaker Keran an opportunity to lower his own world’s
fastest time, never swam in a race before, and the fact
that he used the “ crawl ” stroke from end to end sur-
prised most swimmers, who thought it impossible over
anv distance beyond 200 yards. Trudgeon (double over-
arm) method of travelling will now have to go before the
crawl as the side stroke went before the trudgeon. The
crawl is indubitably speedier than any other stroke, and
directly it is generally adopted over long distances, as it
surely will be since Dickenson’s display, Keran’s remarkable
list of records created this season may be relegated to
oblivion—perhaps before the end of next season.
■* * * ' *
“Crab.”: Have come to the conclusion that it
is impossible for anyone to be a champion swimmer nowa-
days unless he can almost live in the water. The exercise
is so very different to anything on land that it wants a
heap of practice. Swimmers who have lots of time, and
can jump into the water as inclination prompts, are the
champions of to-day, and have been for many years past.
Most were bath proprietors’ sons, who helped in the
baths—notably the (Javills (Australia), and Derbyshire
and Billington (England). Old-time Australian champion
Gormly, in his day, might have been seen at the baths at
any hour ; ditto Arthur Kenney, son of the proprietor of
Kenney’s baths, Melbourne. Keran has Cockatoo Island
baths close to where the Sobraon is moored. Fred Lane
did his best swimming when he had nothing else to do.
George Read was a fine performer while occupied at the
Domain baths, and so on.

A well-known prominent pc titer picked out an
advertised 50-to-l chance for Sydney Cup, and wishing to
invest a “fiver” at the “best price,” made inquiries in
several places, only to find half the odds expected offer-
ing, and, here and there, less than that. Consequently
no business was done. Nevertheless, next day’s papers
told of a big commission having been put on the nag—a
fact which astonished all concerned in his ownership and
preparation more than anyone else. Another way the
“books” have of booming a horse is to multiply the
amount of money he has actually been backed tor by at
least five—lo is a common thing—and report accordingly
to sporting scribes, some of whom (judging by the way it
is put) publish the information under the impression that
it is gospel truth.
Decision of Sydney Tattersall’s Club committee
regarding money speculated on Saraswati, disqualified
from several engagements through wrongful entry, is in
thorough keeping with that body’s policy of looking after
the bookies. Ruling that all bets stand good because the
mare’s backers had a chance to win when they were made,
is bunkum, pure and simple ; the invalidity of entry was
known when the mare went to the starting-post for the
race in connection with which the betting took place ;
this being so, what earthly hope had her backers of
winning?

Istria, who won Rosehill Nursery Handicap,
Saturday, beating 20 others in the hollowest fashion, is
the smartest filly seen in Sydney for many a day, and one
whose prospects are undoubtedly big. She is in coming
A.J.C. Sires Produce and Champagne Stakes.
Two-year-old Lurcher, who won Novice Handi-
cap at Toowoomba last week, promises better than any-
thing seen in Q. for some time. Lurcher was bred by Mr.
S. Hordern, and got by Gossoon from Merry Lass by Nor-
denfeldt. The colt brought 25gs. as a yearling.

They have unearthed a new punter up Ballarat
way. He is worth a power of good money made out of a
W'ell managed farm and the bacon-curing industry—and,
having all the local bookmakers tied in a knot, has now
turned his attention to the Melbourne ring, from which
he has taken a big bet about the double, Medallist and
Dividend for the Doncaster Handicap and the Sydney
Cup.

Harvey Patterson, candidate for V.R.C. Com-
mittee, is very little known in racing circles, but is a
power in the mining world, and it is reckoned that his
knowledge of underground engineering will come in use-
ful. Patterson was a coursing man in the days when
sport with the longtails was fashionable, and he owned a
few horses in his time. One, Bill of Melton, was in C. L.
Macdonald’s stable at Caulfield, but was a rank failure on
the turf. Another is the brood mare Litigant. There is
no doubt new blood will be infused into the V.R.C. Com-
mittee next August.

The Victorian proposal to disallow ownership
of racehorses by bookmakers is likely to fizzle out.
Breeders are up in arms, as bookmakers are about the
only persons who will give a good price for a year-
ling. As a matter of fact, they are the only people
making money on the turf just now. More people turn
round in the streets of Melbourne to catch a glimpse of
Sol Green or “ Tote ” Wren than of the Governor. Green’s
next move will probably be to send Gladsome to England.

Maoriland Rugby Football Union estimates
that the total cost of the Cold Country tour will be £6OOO ;
the Union will pay £2OOO, the remainder to be raised by
debentures, to be redeemed after the tour is over and the
gate receipts totalled up. If there is a shortage, deben-
ture-holders will suffer ; if there is a profit, it will g-o into
the Union’s coffers. Owing to the big percentage de-
manded, the Union isn’t likely to make anything out of a
match in Sydney, and the ALL. body is now kicking
itself because it let the chance slip to scoop in a thousand
or so from a match in Sydney against the Britishers last
season.

Passed out of the football field, J. F. M‘Man-
amey. Firstly as player (for Wars.tv), secondly as the
best referee seen in Sydney, and thirdly as guide and
fr.end to the Rugby Union, M’Manamey has been one of
the most valuable supporters of football in N.S.W.
Pressure of private affairs has caused him to retire among
the spectators. In saying farewell the Rugby Union
sought to bestow a testimonial on him in keeping with
his services. This Mr. M'Manamey firmly refused. His
place as president is taken by another old ’Varsity player,
ex-fullback H. D. L. Woods.

When the Te Aute footballers went back to
Maoriland after running over the college teams of N.S.W.
they told such wondrous tales of the land of the ’possum
and the bear that the Hawkes Bay Maoris are wild to send
an adult team across to wipe the floor with us and
incidentally, have a good time. As an Australian Rugby
team will probably visit Maoriland this season the N.S?W.
Union is likely to drop the proposal outside with a loud
bang. The Maoris have cheerfully intimated that they
are quite prepared to send their team along without anv
official sanction if the matches can be arranged. They
are very strenuous sports, those Maoris.

Jack Johnson, American nigger fighter, chal-
lenges any heavyweight in Australia for the champion-
ship. He wanted to fight Jeffries, but Jeffries draws the
color line, though he has already fought three black men.
Johnson is at present in ’Frisco, but will come to Aus-
tralia if his challenge is accepted.

Several good judges maintain that ex-champion
Cripps’ bad showing in his last fight at the Sydney N.S.C.
was owing to the fact that he had been broken-up bv Bill
Squires, and will never be any good again. “ Starlight”
is said to be in the same boat since Squires beat him up
like a bit of old hoop-iron ; and big Bat Farley’s easy
defeat by Ed. Williams, in Melbourne the other night, is
set down to the same cause. Bill Smith and Billy M’Oall
were evidently on the right track when they sized the
Pelaw Main miner a smasher and coming champion.

Maorilanders were always a bellicose people,
and now that the Maoriland Boxing Association has got
properly going, and district is being pitted against
district, and the whole thing is legal, respectable, and
under the patronage of the unco guid, it won’t be safe to
look sideways at a Maorilamler. The position in Seddon-
land is that the law lias practically given the Boxing As-
sociation a monopoly of these displays. An amended Act
forbids anyone to charge for admission to a boxing exhi-
bition unless the show is run by and under the authority
of the recognised ruling body. The Association can run
professional fighters if it pleases—for an educational
purpose—and devote the whole of the proceeds to the
benefit of the bruisers. Altogether, the idea is a good
one ; it will tend to make the sport wholesome and pro-
vide healthy training for the young.
The latest fight between “Soldier” Thompson
and Californian Al. Neil ended in an unsatisfactory
manner. The first time they met, the “ Soldier ” went
through the Californian like fire through a bush ; the
second occasion saw Neil indulge in tactics, and wear his
opponent out by smothering and hanging on. On tins
occasion, he repeated the plan of campaign, and he seemed
to have brought the art of covering up to a much higher
degree of perfection. Thompson could make no impres-
sion, and when he got too close Neil would let out a
savage, curious hook, which was loaded to the full. Seve-
ral times while he poked round the tortoise, Thompson
caught that ugly smash, and it made him bend at the
knees, but, fortunately for himself, some of the worst
just missed. It lasted seven full rounds, and at the
beginning of the eighth, the “Soldier” broke his hand
against the American’s shell, and retired from the contest.
Neil was declared winner.

The Punch-Casey argument, at Sydney Gaiety
Club, on Saturday night, raised considerable dust and
uproar. It was a curious melee, Casey winning in spite
of himself. Punch threw the money away in a heart-
breaking fashion after having fairly won it. Once Casey,
while rolling about the floor, signed to his corner to wave
the white towel of complete surrender, but the seconds
said to get up and fight. He got, and Punch rushed
in to finish him, grabbed him with one fist, and slogged
him unmercifully with the other. The building rocked ;
the gallery fainted and howled for blood in turns, and the
referee shrieked that Casey had won on a foul. There
was never a more surprised victor.

A London syndicate is planning the “ finest
sports ground and track in the world ” for Shepherd's
Bush (less than four miles out). Its chief feature is to he
a motor-track nearly a mile to the lap, broad enough for
three cars to race abreast, and banked up to “ any speed. ”
Inside this is to be a half-mile-lap cycling track, then a
running path, with a football ground in the centre,
reached by tunnels under the tracks. The co. has fco
acres.
Poisoned Blood.
Face Covered with Sores. Cured by Dr.

What can be more embarrassing or humiliating,
than to have one’s face covered with sores ?
Sometimes pimples, sometimes boils, both due to

which be-
comes so foul
that it bursts

perience of
Mr. Arthur
I. Fraser is a
s t rikingly
bad case
cured by Dr.
Morse’s In-
dian Root
Pills after all
else had
failed. H e
writes :
“About
seven months
ago whilst
playing foot-
ball in Gold-
e n Square,
Bendigo, I
was suddenly taken ill with a breaking-out all over
my body, which caused me to be confined to my
bed. My face became pale and covered with
small blotches. Before going to my bed I went to
see a local chemist in Bendigo, and showed him
the state I was in, and asked if he could do any-
thing for me. He said he could not, I was in such
a state, my blood being very much out of order.
He said the best thing I could do was to go to the
hospital, but I thought I would see a doctor first.
He gave me medicine, but I received no benefit
from it. Seeing the advertisement of your Indian
Boot Pills, I thought I would give them a trial,
and I am very pleased to be able to say that after
taking a few doses of your pills I felt relief. I
kept on until I had used several bottles, and now
I am the picture of health, my skin being quite
clear, and not a sign of the unpleasant breaking-
out left. I honestly recommend Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills as a perfect cure to anyone
suffering as I have done.’ *


AINED SINEWS.
A CYCLIST PRAISES ZAM-BUK
THE stimulating properties of Zam-Buk render
this pure healing balm exceedingly effective
when rubbed well into the muscles and
tendons, or about a joint. It gives tone to the
muscles of the wrist and arm, ankle and calf, and
expels any pain that may be due to impurity in the
blood (as in rheumatism, gout, lumbago, neuralgia,
etc.), and also overcomes any tenderness and swelling
—the result of a sprain or strain. As a striking
illustration, Mr. W. F. Campbell, of the Speedwell
Bicycle Depot, Market Square, Castlemaine, Vic.,
says:—“lt is six years ago since I first twisted
and strained the sinews of my foot and ankle,
through tire strap on the pedal of my bicycle
being rather tight, and not allowing my foot to
come away freely when dismounting in a hurry;
From that time until about five weeks ago I have
always had trouble and pain in the foot and ankle,
and had to wear an elastic bandage for the greater
part of the time. Five weeks back I had a sample
of your Zam-Buk Ointment left at my place, and
seeing by the directions that it was good for
Sprains, etc., I rubbed the Ointment well into my
foot and ankle the same night. I procured a
larger supply next day, and after four or five
applications the sinews became quite strong and
"Si
w
pliable. I have not used the bandage since the first application of Zam-Buk, as there is
not the slightest need for it. lean, with pleasure and confidence, recommend Zam-Buk
to Athletes and others as a good Embrocation and Soothing Balm.”
!T
ZAM-BUK, the Great Healer, is a SPEEDY CURE for PILES, ECZEMA,
BOILS, RUNNING SORES, SORE LEGS, RINGWORM, BARCOO, etc. As an
EMBROCATION for STRAINED MUSCLES and TENDONS, ZAM-BUK, rubbed
well into the parts affected, is unequalled. As a HOUSEHOLD BALM for CUTS,
BURNS, BRUISES, BLACKHEADS,
SORE TH 10AT, RASH and BITES

Mr. Larke, the Canadian Commissioner,
advises the Australian Government to cope with
its drought problem by getting the people to drink
half a million’s worth less whisky annually. But
to follow that course would only lessen the revenue,
unless new taxes were imposed. As things are
now, if the whisky-drinkers were less droughty,
the climatic drought would have less chance of
being mitigated by Governmental interference.

Victoria’s new minor Judge, Eagleson,
appears to be seized with a desire to stress the
folly of the penal system, or else he is incapable of
learning by the experience of others. Last week
he sentenced an old larcenist, with 16 previous
convictions, to five years’ hard labor, the last day
of each month and the final 14 days of this time
to be spent in solitary confinement. Both the
last and the present Inspectors-General of Prisons
have declared against “solitary,” and pointed
out its complete inefficacy. A system with a
grain of common sense would shut such a con-
firmed criminal up for a lengthy term, if not for
life —always taking care that he was made to
maintain himself and his keepers ; and, if he was
deemed still capable of reform, would send him
out into the world with a trade to his hand, in
good heart and good health, with a few pounds
in his pocket. That would give him a chance,
and would also give society a chance to escape
any future unlawful attentions from him. As it
is, he is discharged after 14 days’ semi-starvation,
utterly incapable of doing work if he got it,
damaged in his health, and quite possibly on the
verge of insanity.
“V.J.D.”: I read the other day that
novelist William Le Quex had been appointed
consul in England for the Republic of San
Marino —a quaint honor which I coveted greatly
for myself (though I would have been satisfied
with the Consulship in Australia) in the days when
I had ambitions. There is still left the Republic
of the Andorras. With what pride would I accept
the consulship of that State if it were offered to
me! I think I know enough Irish to be able to
understand Basque. Other persons may hanker
after wealth, or fame, but give me a small useless
but ornamental consulship and I will be happy.
This craving of mine dates from the time when
the late Ernest Moon was Australian consul for
Costa Rica. He was about my size and I tried on
his uniform one evening. It was a dazzling dream
of gold brocade, feathers, epaulets, sash, glittering
belt, gilded spurs, and so forth. What a noble
package for the pawnshop it would make ! From
that moment my chief desire in life was to become
a consul. It grew almost to a delirium when I
made the acquaintance of Press-Agent Oakley,
who was then consul for the Kingdom of Hawaii,
and saw him in his uniform and heard, one day,
when he visited a warship on consular business,
a salute of guns thundered forth on the astonished
air in honor of the representative of his (then)
Majesty King Kalakaua. Then, for the first time,
I knew the meaning of Glory.
Vic. Chief Justice Madden’s new patent
plan of dealing with old offenders by awarding
them a term equal to the aggregate of their pre-
vious sentences went wildly astray the other day.
The culprit’s previous terms amounted to four
years, so when a jury once more convicted him of
assault, His Honor ordered him to gaol for that
term, with a whipping of 10 lashes in addition.
The prisoner had gone down to the cells and al-
most got over the suddenness of the thing when
he was recalled and informed that the Law didn’t
allow the Judge to award more than two years'
“hard,” which was accordingly handed out with
great cordiality.
A table taken from the log of the chief
engineer of the R.M.S. Marmora, showing the
daily noon temperatures of the steamer’s engine-
room and stokehold during ten days’ run after
leaving Suez, on her last trip to Australia, proved
that the engine-room—manned by white engineers
—ranged from four up to 21 degrees higher than
the stokehold; and yet, according to. George
Reid and co., a mail steamer’s stokehold is such a
“hell” that a white man can’t work in it. If
reliable black engineers could be got, doubtless the
nigger-loving shipping eo.’s would, on the plea of
consideration for the white man, put Lascars
there.

7 BLIOH ST., SYDNEY
(Opposite the Union Club).
Hours—9 to 1, and 2to 7.
MR. CLTRURN makes a speciality of Flat-
. foot; when the foot has no spring, the
ankle becomes rigid and painful. Injured knees,
when great pain is felt on the inner side, and no
weight can be borne on the limb, which is often
stiff and much swollen; injured shoulders, when
the arm cannot be raised or put behind the back ;
enlarged and rigid toe joints ; sprained ankles and
wrists of long standing ; hip injuries, dislocations,
spinal curvature, and all forms of lameness.
WONDERFUL CURES.
TELLING TESTIMONY
FROM SYDNEY,
IMPORTANT LETTER FROM ROBERT HOLLIS,
Esq., M.P.
I have known Mr. Charles Morley, of 3.3 Newman-
street, Newtown, for many years. For the last eight
years he has lived nearly opposite my residence. I have
a strong recollection of the unfortunate accident he met
with about two years ago, and the terrible cripple the
accident left him. I have many times conversed with
him, and deplored to him and others his condition from
that of the smart man he was prior to his accident. This
morning, to my great surprise, he walked across from his
house to me without his stick, which hitherto it has been
impossible for him to do. He informed me the great
improvement in his condition was due to a visit to Mr. S.
Cliburn, the day before, at the Australia Hotel, who had
simply pulled his dislocated hip and knee-joints straight.
I consider the result marvellous, and if the joints remain
as they now are, that the skill of this gentleman cannot
be too widely known.
(Signed) Robert Hollis, Newman-st., Newtown, Sydney.
23rd February, 1905.
Extract from the Sydney Evening News, April 10th,
1903, regarding Mr. Morley’s accident: —“Ticket Examiner
Charles Morley did a plucky thing last night, which,
unfortunately, was the cause of his being taken to Sydney
Hospital. In the course of his duty he was on afoot-
board of a tram at the Liverpool and Elizabeth streets
corner, when a passenger, in alighting, fell dangerously
close to the horses in a passing ’bus. Morley jumped off,
and was dragging him out of danger, when the ’bus
struck him to the ground very heavily. He saved the
passenger, hut was badly hurt himself, and had to be
taken to Sydney Hospital by the Civil Ambulance
Brigade.”
FELL 30 FEET AND DISLOCATED
HIS HIP.
SO Elliott-street, Balmain, Sydney,
4th March, 1905.
Dear Sir, —I am a builder and contractor, and nearly
seven years ago I had the misfortune to fall from a bridge
30 feet high on to solid rock, and dislocate my hip joint.
I was in hospital for three months, and afterwards had to
rest at home another three months, with no real benefit.
Subsequently my hip was put under the “X Rays” at
another hospital, and, at last, I was told that nothing
could be done without a surgical operation. Two or three
doctors further examined me, but they said they could do
no good; thus, for the last few years, I have simply hobbled
along as well as I could with my poor crippled leg. For-
tunately, I heard that you were on a visit to Sydney, and
so I consulted you on Monday last, and you there and
then put the bone in. I walk so much better now that
my relatives and friends can scarcely believe that I am
the same man. In the public interest I write this plain
statement of my case. Long may you be spared to carry
on your great and good work. —Yours gratefully,
(Signed) HENRY BUSH.
THE FIRST PATIENT
to consult Mr. Oliburn in Australia was
NURSE YOUNGER.
5 YVellesley-street, Summer Hill Sydney,
9th March, 1905.
Dear Mr. Cliburn. —Pray accept my thanks for curing
my foot, which had tormented me for over four years. I
hail tried liniment, foot-supports, massage, electric and
hot-air baths, etc., without avail, previous to consulting
you, and I feel that I cannot do less than thank you for
the great service you have rendered me.—Yours sincerely,

LETTERS FROM GRATEFUL PATIENTS AT HOME.
FROM A WELL-KNOWN CLERGYMAN.
The Rev. John Turner, for many years the highly-
esteemed vicar of Mickley, near Stocksfield-on-Tyne,
writing under date, 27th January, 1902, says:—“Mr.
Cliburn. Dear Sir, —I feel it to be my duty to write and
tell you of the great benefit that I have derived from your
treatment to my right knee. I injured it twelve years
ago by a fall while bicycling. I have suffered more or
less ever since, sometimes being quite lame. I have con-
sulted three different doctors, and spent £3O, but found
little or no benefit. Your treatment, however, has quite
restored my knee, and it is practically as good as the
other. It is six months since my last visit to you, and
as I can now walk for miles with comparative ease in this
hilly country, I may venture to think myself cured.
Thanking you very much for what you have done for me.”
SUFFERED OYER 30 YEARS.
A BAD FOOT CASE.
Pitcairngreen, Almondbank, Perth, N. 8.,
2nd September, 1902.
Mr. Cliburn. Sir, —I had suffered a great deal of pain
with my right foot that I got injured in the year 1871.

Country Orders by post from all the colonies promptly
attended to.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“F.” : A recent outcry raised by country store-
keepers about the “value-payable parcels-post,’ raises a
question as to whether the storekeeper, in town or
country, has any claim to legislative protection against
competition. The shopkeeper is a middleman, charging
just as much as he can get for everything he can sell. If
he is in a position to kill a rival middleman’s business by
undercutting he does so. He lives on the public’s ina-
bility to buy what they want at first-hand from the
producer. Where is the injustice of the new parcels-
post? Country storekeepers complain that “it causes
inland residents to trade with the city, and thus it helps
to centralise business in the capital, to the disadvantage
of local traders who, in times of bad seasons or when
work is slack, assist the farmers, miners and laborers
to keep their homes by giving them credit.” But
as far as a storekeeper is necessary to the support of
his district, the people who need'him will have to give a
quid pro quo. The “value-payable parcels-post ” merely
invites custom, without consideration for country store-
keepers on the one hand or town shopkeepers on the
other. It doesn’t interfere with any existing mutual-
benefit arrangements as between retail traders and their
supporters. The postal department, like the railway
department, can do no wrong if it is worked in the public
interest, and every section of the public is equally
interested in getting every possible private advantage
from it. If provincial customers of the parcels-post are
at present turning it to their future disadvantage, by
diverting trade from the storekeepers on whom they
depend for “ tick ” when times are bad, they will soon
discover their mistake and act accordingly.
An aspect of the Tobacco Trust that will soon
confront that complacent person, the consumer, is the
risk of having his favorite brand deteriorate. When
manufacturers were competing for popularity and six-
pences they put only their best on the market. Now,
however, the Trust controls the market, and knows that
the consumer will take one brand if he rejects another.
The Octopus has its claw on nearly every tobacco favored
by Australians, so it is a question of take it or leave it,
and the smoker, in 99 cases out of 100, will take it, even
if it isn’t what he used to get for his money.

The Commonwealth is beginning to supply
nearly all its requirements in drugs and patent medicines.
The European and American proprietary firms are now,
by arrangement with local manufacturing chemists and
druggists, having their articles and specifics compounded,
made-up and labelled on the spot. The output of a certain
old-established drug firm has quadrupled since the
inauguration of Federation, by reason of contracts entered
into with the holders of patent rights.

“ Chookey” : Recently bought a book, “Poultry
for Profit,” to discover why my hens do not bring me in
a surplus. Noticing that the picture cover displayed a
handsome rooster and hen standing beside a piled-up
basket of eggs, and a bag of corn twice its size, I did not
go any further. Verb. sap. One egg, lib,, of wheat, or
thereabouts.

“W.L.D.”: Met a good one in the Sydney
suburbs. Dressed as a swqggie, this man’s method is to
crave a drink, and when the housewife brings him a
draught from the Prospect spring, he lays his swag down
heavily with the weary air.of a man who has walked all
the way from Bourke. Just as dirty-faced Matilda
touches ground, from a convenient fold out falls a Bible —
a clean though coverless copy of the Scriptures, hanging
loosely together by the stitching. Confused, the saint
snatches it up, as if to hide bis weakness, but his victim
is now showing an interest in him, thus encouraging him
to stroke the remains with fondness and gently breathe
a tender sigh. “My mother’s last gift to me. But for
the drought I was going to get it bound this trip to
town ; now, I suppose, it will have to wait another year
or fall to pieces. Ah ! poor old mother.” And he scores
every time.

It is popularly supposed that the pawnbrokers
make their largest profits on forfeited pledges. This is
not so. Competition drives them to lend on goods as
near the margin of risk as they dare go, and so they
often lose money on the forfeited pledges which are sold
by auction. But, of course, such losses are a drop in the
bucket compared with the enormous gains made by an
almost weekly turnover (on things of small value) of
about 15 per cent, per week or thereabouts. It is said
that people often buy goods at pawnbrokers’ sales, clean
and mend them, and then pawn them again at a profit.

One big American firm of harvester-makers has
lately erected large show-rooms, warehouse, and offices in
Bourke-street, Melbourne, and as it has built its trade
name into the front of the edifice, it evidently reckons
the present inadequate tariff is likely to be fairly perma-
nent. But that firm lacks the foresight to see things a
bit ahead.

“Ponte”: Have sometimes wondered at the
difference in the prices quoted for N.S.W. North Coast
and South Coast eggs. Just found the reason. South
Coast farmers rear poultry ; North Coast folk keep fowls.
In the South Coast there are properly equipped poultry
yards, and the eggs are collected daily. On the Northern
rivers, the eggs are collected when the dealer comes
round, and sometimes a chicken hatches as he is paying
for the eggs. They only charge for the egg, however.

Of the 1,493,815 bags of wheat exported from
N.S. Wales last season, three firms had their hands on no
less than 1,275,788 bags. When the buying has been
practically fined down to three firms, and not one of those
with its headquarters in N.S. W., it is time for wheat-
growers to think of looking after their own interests.
N.S.W. hardwood timber trade shows signs of
life. Present primitive means of dealing with the easily
accessible timber are useless in tapping the large reserves
in the back ranges ; and this, added to the great difficulty
in shipping the lumber over the shallow northern river
bar-harbors, has prevented trade from increasing much.
The oversea demand for North Coast woods, is, however,
so persistent, and so evidently increasing, that capital is
being raised in several directions. That is one reason
why Allen Tavlor and Co.’s business goes into a limited
liability co. ’But the harbor-bar difficulty seems big
enough in itself to cause considerable worry.
“Pot”: Even boys aren’t cheap enough now.
I saw about a dozen young girls t’other morning entering
a large South Melbourne brass foundry, and on investiga-
tion found that they worked there, making sand cores for
casting valves, etc.

“ D’Harum ” : An American typewriting agent
called on me recently. He was agent for the Clicker
Typewriter, he said, more of which were used than of any
other machine in existence. My typewriter was a
Rattler, and when I told him so, he puckered up his brow
and said in a scornful way, “You should never use a
Rattler ; they’re no good.” I contradicted him, and said
I had had it for years, and it had never turned dog on me
once. “Of course,” he confessed presently, “I know
nothing about the Rattler, but a Clicker is a far superior
machine in every respect.” He used to be a journalist
himself, he told me, but chucked it up for typewriting
canvassing. The commission was usually good in this
line ; one agent of the firm he represented recently sold
1290 Clicker machines to the Austrian Government, and
retired on the proceeds of the deal. A typewriter sold in
Australia at £25 represents about £lO more than the
American price ; agents here make from about £5 to £lO
on a machine after duty is paid. I worked another secret
of the trade out of him. Usually when a new make of
typewriter comes out, the makers present a few hundred
machines to big firms all over the world, and advertise
that their machines are being used by these leading
people. Most machines are advertised at £25, but if
you’re a poor man with only £lO to spend, you’d most
likely get one for that out of die respect the firm has for
you, even if it never heard of you before.
The French police have been tracking up some
life-insurance conspirators, and allege that they have
“had” various offices for £200,000. Australia has only
had one big case of this rare and difficult sort of swindle,
and that one, put up by a mere lad, an Adelaide medical
student, came to grief. The invalid who carried the
insurance joined in the swindle —his share was a comfort-
able cottage and care while he lived. But the con-
spirators, who included of course the doctor and the
agent, put him down alongside the sea, in S. Aus.,
and that didn’t improve his consumptive cough. The
youngster, who planned the business, turned Queen’s
evidence (it was 23 years ago), and then faded out of the
country ; the others went to gaol.

The dress circle of one antiquated Tasmanian theatre
has one distinction —its generous supply of fleas. " When
the circle is full on a warm night, a characteristic sound,
known as the knee-rustle, sometimes swells to such a
volume as to threaten to drown the orchestra. It is
caused by the furious excursions of the fleas, and the
efforts of the frenzied fair to dislodge them in a seemly
manner.
A comic opera company’s star made such a conquest of
a bank official’s heart in W.A. that, when she refused him,
he had to be sent to the receiving-house to save his life.
“Val. Day” : Miss Marie Rignold undoubtedly inherits
the family talent, and is likely to go further than either
of her sisters, Bessie or Dora, for the reason that her
features are more expressive, her voice more flexible, and
her powers for the pourtrayal of the passions more con-
siderable. Miss liignold, at times,'is reminiscent of Olga
Nethersole.
Van Biene has one craze outside the playing of the
missing chord —that is, cards. One night at a flutter in a
fashionable hotel he burst from a strategic move in a
poker plot to exclaim, with emotion, “Ah, if only I had
Foldesy’s left hand and my own soul, I ivould play the
’cello —mein Gott —yes ! ” Thereafter he fervently re-
turned to his (right) poker hand.
J. C. Bain, who is in the third year of his continuous
variety show at Hobart Temperance Hall, has contributed
very generously to charities. When Bain gives a benefit
to a specially-deserving object, it is his practice to hand
over the gross proceeds.
Melbourne’s musical set, headed by Lady Northcote, is
interesting itself in the matter of a testimonial concert
for Rita Hope, the clever Conservatorium damsel who
captured the £25 prize for piano-playing at the recent
A.N.A. competition. The proposal is to send Miss Hope
to Germany, that she may get a course of first-class
tuition before she is out of her teens. Her talent is
worth it.
Auguste Van Biene (who promised to return), on his
last appearance at "Sydney Lyceum, said that he had been
jolly glad to come to Sydney, and was jolly sorry to leave
it. Prior engagements had ended, after twelve perform-
ances, one- of the most enjoyable seasons he had known
during the 4000 and odd occasions on which he had
played “ The Broken Melody.” But the audience
applauded him most loudly when he eulogised its intelli-
gence, artistic sympathies, kindliness, and enthusiasm.
It was like a man standing up to drink his own health.
London Sporting and Dramatic News says that Delia
Mason’s best work in the new piece, “The Madcap,” is
“ her admirable pantomime during a love-song by Maurice
Farkoa.” Australia remembers that business well —how
Farkoa’s stage-partner of the moment had to pretend to
be all broken up by his too fervent love-making, so that
the audience, on the first visit, always took for real
maidenly confusion what was actually a fine piece of
acting. But in this case, as Delia and Farkoa were mar-
ried about the time “The Madcap” was staged, there
maj' have been some real “ realism ” in the performance.
“ Paradis ” : Nance O’Neil writes on “ Criticism ” in the
last Broadway. I am suspicious of such contributions.
The Roman hand of the litterateur, with finished style, is
too evident. My experience of Thespians’genuine writings
is that they sprawl tarantula-wise, like their speeches
before the curtain. Yet this one has the evident actuality
of embodying Miss O’Neil’s sentiments, however purple-
patched up. She hungers to be criticised, for good or
bad. She wants to be dissected. Yet she only gets smart
essays written round her. They are intangible. The
critic merely shows himself off, and amuses the reader.
Like the Bard of Avon, he must drag in every good thing
that occurs to him. Miss O’Neil wants to be criticised in
the spirit of Ruskin before a Turner. That is only my
expression for the kind of thing she seems to aim at.
One lately-departed warbler made her opportunity by a
remarkable burst of pluck. She was earning a crust in
the back row of the chorus when, one Saturday night,
the orchestra played the opening bars'of a song, the
chorus circled round, but the star did not come from the
wings. The orchestra began the introduction again,
when out stepped the chorus girl. Glancing at the eon-
ductor, she began the song, and the audience thundered
recalls. The scene with the star and the manager was
also thundery. But the girl got a good engagement the
next week.
“ W.J.H.”: Re “Adelaide’s” par. (25/3/’os)of surprise that
lately deceased novelist Boothby never attempted drama.
A couple of Boothby’s earlier efforts (“ Dr. Nikola ” in par-
ticular) were originally intended for the stage. Boothby
hawked them round amongst London managers unsuc-
cessfully, and then set to work and re-wrote them as
romances. Anyone carefully reading “Dr. Nikola” will
detect the evidence of this alteration without difficulty:
“ Salome,” the sacred melo drama by Oscar Wilde, which
was illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley, has been lately
staged at the Central Theatre, ’Frisco, amidst dead
silence as to the unfortunate author’s name. Wilde seems
to have helped himself liberally from the “Johannes”
of Sudermann, and the Passion Play of Oberammergau,
as well as from the Scriptures.
“Scribe”: Why doesn’t some indignant pressman
commit a brutal assault on the playwright who derides
him before a contemptuous public ; or, better still, con-
spire with some detective, who is an equal sufferer, to
convict the dramatist of some serious offence ? The
reporter as he appears on the stage is an awful person,
who seems a cross between a particularly obsequious
waiter and a bumptious suburban alderman. Captain
Marshall’s shocking creation in “ The Duke of Killie-
crankie ”is a horrible example of the type. Marshall
makes his man an ass as well as a crawler, but the
reporter sent from London to Scotland over such a big
business as the abduction of a society beauty by a real
live duke would be a sort of man fit to pass anywhere as
an ambassador.
Hugh Ward has struck oil in Fogtown. Just on arrival
he appeared in Drury Lane panto., and staggered the
cockneys wdth his weird performance of a scarecrow. It
was his own scarecrow—a figure of straw that became
animated. W. S. Gilbert wrote to him saying that his
performance was quite novel, arid one that made a deep
impression. Letters of appreciation from Gilbert are
rare. In this year’s effort Ward plays the Missing Link
and goes through various stages of evolution under the
influence of patent foods. Between times he danced and
pantomimed at the Empire.
“E.”: Carrie Moore, in the impossible “ Cingalee,’
differs froiri the English comedienne in having more dash
and less style. The typical English gaiety girl can’t act,
sing or dance, but she tries to look charming, at once
chic and innocent, and to carry her wardrobe gracefully.
London won’t improve Carrie.' She seems likely to lose
her dash, and acquire a “ style ” that will distress every-
body bar the Piccadilly johnnie.
The trustees of the old North Sydney Hos-
pital are offering the ground and building material
by auction on an early date. In these days of
antiseptic precautions, surely the sale of these old
hospital bricks and fittings is mistaken policy.
A truth from John Burns :
Put Arthur Balfour or the Archbishop of Canterbury
into a slum such as I entered in Bermondsey—with nis
front door up against a dirty railway arch, his back door
up against a tannery, and with his wife, three children
and himself living in two rooms—and Arthur Balfour
would become an Anarchist, and the Archbishop a dipso-
maniac.
London Daily Mail :
The researches of General P. Walker, former head of the
American census department, show that foreign immigra-
tion has a marked effect on the birth-rate of the United
States. As the foreign parasite crowds in to prey upon
the social organism, the American birth-rate has steadily
fallen. In England the rapid growth of alien immigra-
tion has been followed by a steady decline in the British
birth-rate ; that of London, which most feels the compe-
tition of the foreigner, with his lower scale of livin**- was
last year the lowest on record. The higher standard of
life yields slowly but certainly before the lower, as the
oak is first exhausted, and then killed, by the mistletoe
which preys upon its sap ; as the rabbit drives out sheep
and cattle in the Australian pasturage. The reason is
that the higher standard of life will not risk submitting
its progeny to the competition of the lower, and prefers
to perish sooner than sink in the social scale.
Which is sound sense, and supplies the ultimate
reason at the back of laws to restrict undesirable
immigration. Fail to keep out the weeds, and the
garden perishes. Admit freely the undesirables
to a country, and the desirables dwindle away.
George Reicl has thrown the growling
Lords of Calico a bone. Just when it was evident
that Australia couldn’t afford to pay the price
demanded by the steamship co.’s for carrying
English mails as long as the 2kl. postal rate was
maintained —a rate fixed when Australia looked at
everything from a borrowing-boom standpoint—
the Premier has fixed up an arrangement with
the English Govt, to still further reduce the rate.
The English G.P.O. will send out the letter of
advice regarding the calico, and the other corres-
dence, for a penny, and Australia is to charge 2d.
for carrying the return letters to Britain. “ Mr.
Smith regards this as a great step in the way of
drawing closer the bonds,” &c. Quite likely. At
the 2gd. rate N.S.W. was £3491 out of pocket in
1903, even at the old mail subsidy-rate ; and if a
higher subsidy is now agreed to, there will be a
bigger deficit, and deficits mean borrowing, and
borrowing means bonds—with Australia as the
bondsman every time.
The awful, unpluinbed depths of the Pres-
byterian conscience in Melbourne may be gauged
by the fact that a Richmond ferryman stood by
and allowed a little girl to drown in the Yarra
because he feared to remove his clothes in the
presence of some women. This was no mere
excuse. The man had already proved his courage
in saving no less than four different persons from
drowning. But his clothing prevented him from
diving for the sunken child, and he had had it so
drilled into his mind that “ modesty” should be
f reserved at all hazards, that he remained dry.
n modern Melbourne it is not Virginia who dies
rather than strip. It is Paul who lets her drown
because the influence of the Presbyterian consci-
ence is irresistible. And perhaps Paul is right.
Did he strip and bring the drowning person
ashore, he might get a year and a couple of
floggings by the sapient justices who fine men
£1 for swimming on lonely beaches in full bathing
costume.
Concerning the Russian “Tommy,” from
war-correspondent Douglas Storey’s book, “The
Campaign with Kuropatkin ” :
Ivan Ivanovitch is a big, burly, bovine type of fighting
man. He is docile and respectful, long-suffering and slow
to anger, simple of faith, and altogether lacking in the
arrogance of the professional soldier. He will cook a
meal or whitewash his officer’s dwelling, nurse the child
of his captain’s lady,- or stand long hours outside a
restaurant waiting, as willingly as he will shoulder a rifle
against an enemy or present arms at a review.
The Russian private is never absolutely the soldier.
He is the peasant in arms—dogged, loyal, and
formidable. . . . He marches with the swing of a man
accustomed to tramping, chanting his folk-songs. . . .
Much vile libel has been spread about the Russian
soldier’s treatment of the Chinese in the war area. So far
as I have seen—and I have seen most of the country he
has traversed—the Russian soldier has behaved to the
Chinese with remarkable restraint and a simple-hearted
good-fellowship. There has been no commandeering in
this war, and marvellously little looting. John China-
man and Ivan Ivanovitch are friends. There is no distrust
On the part of the one, and no brutality on the part of
the other. The Russians possessed magnificent fighting
material—great strong sons of the . soil, who wasted no
time in asking questions, who troubled not about com-
ment or criticism, but who lacked the fierce fanaticism
or the scientific direction which made their enemy
irresistible.
Up at Goyder’s Lagoon, 230 miles from
Hergott, on the Birdsville (Q.) track, S. Australia
lately finished the second-deepest bore in the con-
tinent, and now every day over half-a-million
gallons of water rushes up from a depth of 4850 ft.,
and it is only a point or two below boiling
when it reaches the surface—less than a couple of
hundred yards short of a mile from its starting-
point. The deepest Australian bore is on Bimer'ah
(Q.); that one gets down to within 79 yards of
the full mile. A curious fact is that, though this
.artesian water comes from Queensland, the further
S. Australia gets with its bores from Hergott, and
the nearer to Queensland, the deeper it has to
probe. At Hergott they got water at 340 ft. ;
every mile further from that point has meant,
approximately, an extra 20ft. of drilling.
Kangaroo, wallaroo, wallaby and bear skins are
in great demand, and present prices are the highest that
have been paid for many years. The skin of the rabbit
looks as though it will he good property in the winter.
Opossum skins also promise well. The only way to get
utmost value is at auction through such firms as
Winehcombe, Carson and Co., Sydney.*
Messrs. Harrington and Co., have gone into new
premises at 386 George-street, a few doors from the
G;KO., Sydney. This position is in the heart of the city,
and as the building is entirely new, and has been specially
fitted to suit the requirements of Messrs. Harrington’s
business, the firm will now successfully cope with the big
demands of its constantly increasing business. The
premises comprise five large floors and have a double
frontage window allowing an excellent display. One
feature of the new building is a set of dark rooms avail-
able, free, to amateurs. In addition t ) their counter and
mail order department, the firm have established on the
ground floor a bargain counter where second-hand and
solid goods may lie bought and where exchanges can be
made. Messrs. Harrington began in 1881) with one man
and a boy. To-day there are 75 hands employed at
Sydney headquarters alone. And these are exclusive of a
large number of hands employed in the firm’s bulk stores
and warehouses in Kent-street.*

HEALTH
VITALITY
KUTN
APPETITE
STRENGTH
KUTNOW’S POWDER is one of the most beneficial remedies for the improvement of health and the prevention of disease ; in fact, it is the one remedy
which enjoys the support and approval of the general body of medical practitioners. The reason for the recognition of its value by such distinguished
physicians as PROF. LAWSON TAIT, M.D., SIR MORELL MACKENZIE, M.D., SIR SPENCER WELLS, M.D., and SIR ANDREW CLARK,
M.D., is not difficult of comprehension. Kutnow’s Powder is appreciated by doctors because they know that it contains nothing which is injurious, no
mercurial poison, nothing painful or drastic, and nothing but what is beneficial. The most delicate person can take it, even very young children and
invalids find it agreeable ; moreover, its action is so gentle and soothing that insensibly to the patient it efficiently does its work. It clears and flushes the
entire system of all noxious debris and poisonous liquids, which action is invaluable to both sick and well. It gradually changes certain morbid conditions
of the system, and establishes healthy tissue, which alone is able to bring about a sound constitution. It stimulates the vital processes to renewed
activity, and enables the kidneys and bowels to remove waste matter which ought to be eliminated, one of the most important of which is URIC ACID.
In this way Kutnow’s Powder alters, corrects and purifies the fluids, gives tone to, and re-establishes the healthy function of, all the digestive and other
organs of the body. It cleanses and lubricates the human machinery. Kutnow’s Powder is an alterative which possesses tonic, laxative, stimulant,
and diuretic properties. It is a mild aperient which flushes the whole alimentary canal. It is a stimulant which has the power of increasing the vital
activity of the body. It is a cholagogue which never fails to make the liver act properly. Its alkaline action neutralises excessive acidity in the stomach
and bowels. It is an antiseptic which prevents putrefaction. These are the qualifications of Kutnow’s Powder, and, needless to say, they never fail
to assist in the maintenance and re-establishment of Health.
H. A. BOEDER, Esq.,
writes
“113 Gower-street, London, W.C.
‘ ‘ I consider it only fair to apprise you of the
remarkable beneficial results obtained by the use
of Kutnow’s Powder. I purchased a bottle, and
continued with a dose for several mornings before
breakfast. For a long time past I suffered from
severe mental depression, due to an inactive liver
and kidney trouble, with' excessive uric acid.
Thanks to your efficient remedy I no longer fear
these distressing attacks, as I find a single dose
corrects any mistakes in diet and removes the
injurious poisons. In the hope that my letter
may lead others to try what has proved an in-
valuable boon to me, you may make whatever
use you please of my testimony.”

♦
All respectable Chemists sell Kutnow’s Powder, but there
are others, who, for the sake of a little extra profit, will
attempt to foist upon you some cheap imitation of their
own. It is well known that these cheap concoctions are
highly dangerous, and in the case of delicate, sensitive
persons capable of inflicting permanent injury. Kutnow’s
Powder is pure, painless, palatable, free from sugar, and
absolutely harmless. See that the fac-simile signature,
“S. Kutnow & Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade mark,
“ Hirschensprung, or Deer Leap,” are on the carton in
which the bottle is packed, and also on the label on the
bottle. This signature and trade mark will alone insure
your obtaining the
Genuine Kutnow’s Powder
THE DOCTOR’S ADVICE.
“ 2 Percy-road, Wrexham, July 6, 1904.
“Sirs, —Some five years ago I had an acute
attack of nephritis (inflammation of the kidney),
and my doctor advised Harrogate waters. After
trying them for some time with very little result
the doctor suggested giving your Powder a trial,
with such excellent result that in a short time I
felt very much better. I continued taking it
regularly every other day for two years, and con-
sider it worked an entire cure. I never go to a
patient without a bottle in my possession. Many
of my patients have tried it with excellent results.
I think the wonderful good done in such cases
should be widely known for the benefit of other
sufferers.
“ Yours sincerely,
“MARGARET CROSS (Nurse).”

It Is natural for a man to desire to live his life unafflicted by disease. Not one man in ten
thousand reaches his three score years and ten without having: at some time cuffered from seme
form of deadly disorder. This is caused by Youthful Indiscretion, Exposure, Brain-strain, or Contrasted
Disorders arising from Specific causes. Diseases that w;li hill insiaiousl; and surely tfie Gtron£est
man in a littie time are Deadly Varicocele, General Debility, Eladder Affections, Kidney trouble,
Uric Acid in the Blood causing Rheumatism, Cystitis, Gout and Chalky Formation of the Joints and
other serious ailments arising from a polluted blood system. Wien who are afflicted with any form
of devastating disease which paralyses the Functional Power and threatens permanent physical
decay, should consult the Specialists of
THE FREEMAN and WALLACE
MEDICAL INSTITUTE
The Medical Staff of this great health centre is known throughout the Commonwealth as
being experts of a very high order in the treatment of Men’s Peculiar Debilitated Disorders.
These require Special treatment and Special knowledge of their causation and phenomena, and
anyone treating same without that Special knowledge may aggravate and maltreat them. Man
can rely upon three things at the hands of the Specialists : Secrecy in Correspondence ; Effec-
tiveness in Treatment; and Permanency of Cure. To the men who have suffered for years, and
who have tried doctors without receiving benefit, the last-named specially appeals.
*• *-* * * ffr * *
The reasons are grave why these Special diseases require Special treatment. With proper obedience to
our Medical methods, there is no such thing as failure. We can explain fully to any man why
the diseases of men require the knowledge and skill of the Expert. Practice makes perfect in all lines, and is
it not reasonable to suppose that we can excel where we treat thousands of cases before those who only treat
hundreds? Where disease involves the most delicate parts of the' Human Anatomy, Specialists only should
undertake tiie cure. Inexperienced treatment is malpractice in its worst form, and may result in permanent
paralysis or death. It is a duty you owe to yourself to communicate with any persons who have given us
testimonies. We court the closest investigation.

DR. RICHARD WALLACE, M.D.,
Physician*in*Chief to the Institute.
One of the most important maladies successfully treated by the Specialists is NERVO-
VITAL DEBILITY - . There is certainly no victim of Nervo-Vital Debility but what hopes
to be rejuvenated some time. A man should not lose his g'rip on life because inferior remedies have
failed to benefit him. The special treatment given at the Institute for th ; s trouble, varied and modified
to suit each individual case, is an unfailing cure, to which a vast army of restored men to-day owe their
sturdy health and happy condition of life. Under it all disagreeable symptoms soon disappear,
prematureness prevented, strength thoroughly restored, and manhood made complete.
If you cannot visit the SPECIALISTS personally, write the symptoms that trouble you most, and
you will receive an honest and scientific diagnosis of your case, together with their latest MEDICAL
BOOK on MALE PELVIC DISEASES, “CLINI3AL EXPERIENCES, ” 150 medical plates, 580 pages, 31

A vast majority of cases can be cured bv our system of Home Treatment, which is the most
successful system ever devised. The FREEMAN & WALLACE INSTITUTE makes no charge for private
counsel, and gives to each patient a legal contract in writing, backed by abundant capital, as a guarantee
of good faith. Physicians having stubborn cases to treat are cordially invited to consult the Medical

Who says official Year Books are no good ?
The Auckland Herald publishes an advt. :
A N English Gentleman, desirous of making a home
anywhere in New Zealand, having read in the
Official Year Book there are 100,000 marriageable
ladies in New Zealand, invites one of them, between
20 and 40, who has a business or income of £l5O a
year, or more, to write to him. He is tall, fair, affec-
tionate, religious, and abstainer. Strictest honor ob-
served and required, and letters faithfully returned if
unsuitable.
“F.C.” : Made an inspection lately of the
works now in progress at Elwood, in Bent’s elec-
torate. The front of the bluff has pretty well
disappeared, and the scheme now discloses itself
in the shape of a 2-chain drive, 6ft. above high
tide, along the foreshore from St. Kilda to
Brighton, with the Bay in front and rockeries and
other frills behind. But the swamp is just about
where it always was. Three acres of bluff, 12ft.
deep, don’t fill in 200 acres of swamp to any great
extent. A drain with cemented sides, whose bed
is below high water-mark, is now adorned with a
temporary wooden dam at its mouth and a perman-
ent “ bar” of piles outside in order that it may get
dry, for the contractors to put in a sandy
bottom 2ft. deep with 4 inches of cement on top.
So far about a couple of chains are finished ; for
the rest of the mile the blessed “ canal” bott.om is
merely a vile abomination—a filthy, slimy ooze,
black as tar, into whose horrible depths a stone
sinks slowly but certainly. In this foetid ooze
eels crawl, and these the local youngsters
stab with long rods and take home for
supper! The St. Kilda boy has a powerful
stomach and is daring withal, but none of
him dare venture into that putrid slime.
All the money being spent on this job is practi-
cally thrown away. The only efficient way to
deal with the Elwood drain is to clean out the
filth right down to the pure soil, put a permanent
bar at the outlet high enough to keep out the
tides and low enough to let the drainage overflow
freely, sink a large catchpit at the canal-head, and
compel St. Kilda and Elsternwick to burn their
refuse, allowing nothing but surface drainage to
flow down the canal.

A GOOD
!
REPORT
From Camperdown.
The Case of
Mr. E. J. SWORDS.
(By a Special Reporter.)
A condition of allairs favourable to
all sorts of ailments that had been in
existence a good while received an cr-
fective check, in connection with which
a newspaper man paid a visit ( of en-
quiry to Mr. Hdward John Swords
business premises, 150 Missenden-road,
Camperdown, and received the follow-
? ‘YesV' said Mr. Swords, “I can eas-
ily tell you all that is of importance
in connection with the illness i escap-
ed from in 1890, when 1 was living at
Trang-ie, on the great-western line—a
.very hot place, too." . ~
‘‘How long were you residing there.
‘‘Three years. Quite long enough to
ascertain 'that it was principally the
heat which was knocking me out, with
the sedentary nature of my trade,
which is that of a saddler. 1 got to
feel so much out of sorts that 1 couiu
not stand being- indoors, so 1 had to
leave my work and go travelling, ihe
clmnoe seemed to give me a lilt for a
while, but it was not long before 1 got
into my old state again, and as time
wore on my health went irorn. bad to
worse. When 1 got up of a morning
felt fearfully languid, and i pictured
each day as it started as a long,
dreary term that would never end, and
how I would get through it i did not
know. But even when they terminated
1 was no better oil, as nightfall oill >
meant so much restlessness that I did
not know what to do to put in the
time till morning, and when it arrived
and 1 had to get up, I felt so weak
and low-spirited that I did not care
what happened. My internal disorders
caused such a bitter taste to come to
my mouth that on arising I often felt
inclined to retch, but i con kbit. and 1
was never prepared to sit down and
eat a breakfast like a man should do.
As soon as 1 sa't to the table, and the
food came in sight, a sickly sensation
came to mv stomach, and i would
have to get up and leave everythino-
untouched, but, later in the day, I was
general Iv more successful in eating, a
little—very little, because mv. appetite
was weak —but it didn t make any uit-
feronce, as my digestion was gone al-
together."
‘‘What were your feelings like when
you had eaten ?’’
‘‘Dreadful ! 1 can hardly describe
them. My chest had such a sensation
in it that I don’t know what to say.
I know i felt that if I turned round
quiciviy it would break in two, and the
way I sometimes had to gasp for
breath would have made you think 1
was astlimatical.■ Then I also suffered
from cramps in the stomach, caused,
no doubt, by wind that gathered there
from the .decayed food, and if L had to
go through the same again, I would
much rather die. Many a time I ac-
tually sang out with pain, which also
used’ to 'find its way down my right
side, and almost -cripple mei Heaven
knows, I was a martyr !’’
“Did you lind your weight reduced
at all ?" ,
“I fell away terribly—from eleven
stone four pounds down to about ten
stone. Just merely a skeleton of what
1 had been ; and what made me feel my
ahucuons so greatly was Hardly being
able to move without feeling incon-
venience. 1 have done a good deal of
rough rifling in my time, and used to
crijov it, but when I was ill. I. couldn’t
get on the quietest animal living with-
out the motion hurting me, for, be-
sides what I’ve told you, I had such
intense pain across my back that I was
compelled to walk bent up like an old
man.’’
“How long were you ailing like this?"
“For fully twelve months, and you
had better believe that during that
time l did not continue suffering for
the want of taking physic—no, indeed
I took a great many bottles of medi-
cines, only, I’m sorry to say, to find
that my money had gone for nothing,
in some instances, to bo made worse
than I was before. There was one lot
of advertised pills I took which made
me feet that 1 was going to die, 1 felt
so ill, and after them, thank heaven I I
procured some Clements Tonic. Ah .
now I soon wished I had taken that
remedy before. What a year of tor-
ture it would have saved me, but it is
no use regretting. I’m lucky to have
<r o t off like I did, and there is no
doubt that Clements Tonic is entitled
to all the credit, for that was the only
remedy that could do me any good.
Why, if you could form an idea of the
intensity of the headaches from which
I regularly suffered you would say that
nothing but a miracle could have
cured them, and if that’s so then Cle-
ments Tonic must be a miraculous me-
dicine, for it cured mine. Besides this
it also put an end to the giddy turns
I used to have. Upon my word, at one
time I could not stoop down without
feeling as if I would surely fall over,
and I have often been sitting on a
chair and expecting to come a cropper
every second owing to the same dis-
agreeable sensation. My sight had
been very dim for a good while, my
eyes feeling swollen, and as if they had
a scum over them ; my tongue used to
be white with fur, too, yet Clements
Tonic set all these defects to rights,
even when all other had been
put aside as useless.” , .
“You mentioned that you had done
some rough-riding in your time. You
require good nerves for that sort oi
business, don’t you ?” , ,
“I should rather say so ; but 1 had
been without them for quite twelve
months previous to using Clements
Tonic, and would never have had good
nerves again but for that remedy. 1
had not only been so' nervous that 1
could not keep myself from shaking,
but even my mind was easily upset by
any noises, which made me exceeding-
ly irritable, and I. was always feaiing
some kind of evil. The greater part of
my nights were spent in restlessness,
for I was a!wavs thinking, thinking,
and when at last I dozed into slum-
ber, the dreams I had were awful—for
all tho world like the nightmare. Well, it
was a happy day for me when I de-
cided to buy Clements Tonic, as it put
quite a different complexion upon the
whole of my career, it imparted more
strength to mv nerves than they ever
had betore, and there’s nothing in the
world like that remedy to make one
sleep and eat. In a few weeks T
couldn’t locate a pain of any sort
about my body, and the best of it was
that I’was ’gaining l strength and
weight all the time.”
“Did Clements Tonic cure you tho-
roughly ?”
“My cure couldn’t have been more
complete, and I trust my experience
may be an object lesson to all who
require treatment. In any case you
may publish this narrative in any form
vou desire.”

breeze after a hot day, or cold blowing wind, 'would con-
fine him to the house for days. I had medical advice
and used different patent medicines, but without success
until I got one small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure’
which has freed him completely from the Catarrh. Since
then he has been out in damp weather to school, and o-oes
about like any other child ; in fact, he seems to havelost

tried it, and found that it gave him great relief. One
bottle was sufficient to put him right. This gentleman
is over 70 .years of age, an old bushman who has been in
these parts for the last 30 years, and is well known. He
makes my house his home when here, and got the medi-
cine from me. He is at my place now, and lie says that

CONSUMPTION-
Too ill to leave his bed.
A complete cure.
Mr. W. G. ilcarne.
Dear Sir,—l am writing to tel! you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in rnv case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled \vith night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doc tor, who pronounced m3' case to be con-
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
jour Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed,
but I commenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. I am glad to say that the two lots of medicine
jousent have effected a complete cure, for which accepi
my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR,
Westminster-bridge Road, S.E., London.

“ I had suffered from rheumatism and sciatica for several years, and had tried many remedies,

for three or four weeks at a time. I tried all kinds of medicines without getting any better, and at
last gave up all hope of ever getting well. Several of my friends recommended me to take Warner’s
Safe Cure, Dut I was so sick and tired of taking different medicines that for some time I refused to
follow tlie’advice. I gave in at length, and now I am glad to say that I am entirely free from my old
complaint, and have not had a touch of it for about seven years, thanks to Warner’s Cafe Cure.”
From Mr. Albert E. Long, Port Pirie, S.A., 9th January, 1903.
“lam pleased to report that I have taken five bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure for rheumatism, and.
that the result was marvellous. The pain has all left me, I have gained a stone in weight, and am
now in good health.”
From R. A. Thompson, Mining Engineer, 148 Adelaide Terrace, Perth, W.A., 21st July, 1902.
“ When writing you some time back as to the efficacy of Warner's Safe Pills in biliousness, I
mentioned being about to try a course of Warner’s Safe Cure for gout. The result of taking the
medicine was simply wonderful, as many people in Perth can testify, and I speak gratefully of the
benefit I received. The action of the medicine was this : First, a gradual toning up of the stomach,
then better appetite, purer blood-making, and slow (at first) but sure disappearance of the gout. The
food taken during the course was plain but wholesome. I am also glad to tell you that many of my
acquaintances have derived great benefit from both the Safe Pills and the Safe Cure. [10.]
A Rough Passage.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ about ’orses,” said Bill, the old
I Shellback, “ I remember the only time
I ever ’ad anythink ter do with a norse.
It was some years ago, but I ain’t ever forgot it.”
“How was that?” I asked, handing him the
rum bottle.
“Thank yer; I don’t mind if I do. Yer see,
it was this way : I was sailing then with one-arm
Miller in the Maud ’Eneryetter, a 90-ton topsail
schooner, tradin’ to Port Stephens. This trip,
when we gets to the Port, a chap comes off in a
boat and jumps aboard. ’E ’as a yarn with the
ole man, an’ the ole man ’e calls me aft an’ ’e says
to me, ’e says, ‘ ’Ere’s a telegrapht fer yer, Bill.’
“Well, I opens it, an’, after er bit, I makes it
out. It was mighty short. ‘ Wife dyin’, come at
wonct.’ I shows it ter the ole man, an’ ’e says,
‘ That’s a blarsted nuisance, ain’t it, ’cos I’ll be
short-handed with the cargo if yer goes V
“‘Yes,’ I says, ‘it is a blarsted nuisance.
What d’yer think I orter do ? ’
“ ‘ Well,’ he says, ‘ it do look as if the ole
woman was on’er beam-ends.’
“ ‘Yes,’ I says, ‘it do look somethink like it.’
“ ‘ Ev course,’ ’e says, ‘ the telegrapht don’t
say as ’ow it’s your wife ; an’, if it comes ter that,
it might be anybody’s. I don’t see meself as ’ow
the dockerrnent makes yer liarbul.’
“ The ole man was mighty clear in the ’ead about
things/an’ it alwus seemed ter me ’e was built fer
a lawyer. ‘That’s true,’ I says, ’avin’ another
squint at the telegrapht— ‘it only says “Wife
dyin’.” But, after all, I s’pose it’s meant fer me.
Anyway, what d’yer advise me ter do?’
“ ‘ Well, er course,’ ’e says, drawin’ hisself uper
bit, ‘ if yer wants my opinion yer can ’ave it; an
it’s this—‘lf JE was you, I wouldn’t dispute the
matter.’
“ ‘ Thank yer,’ I says ; ‘ but what I wants ter
know is, ’ow I’m goin’ ter go at wonct?’
“ ‘ I.tell yer .what yer’ll ’ave ter do,’ ’e says.
‘ Yer’ll ’ave ter make this trip overland.’
“‘Overland!’ Isays—‘l don’t know ’ow I’m
goin’ ter go overland ! ’
“‘Yer’ll '.ave ter,’ ’e says, ‘though I don’t
s’pose yer’ll get there in time fer ter see the larst
draw. ‘ Owsomever, ’ ’e says, meaning ter comfort
me like, ‘ yer’ll get there in time fer the fun’ral,
■’cos they’ll be able ter keep the corpse a day or
two longer, this time er year.’
“‘Maybe,’ I says; ‘but ’ow’m I goin’ ter go
overland, ’cos I can’t walk it ? ’
“‘No,’ he says, ‘I don’t s’pose yer can walk
it, ’cos it’s a mighty long way from ’ere ter
Newcastle, which’s yer nearest port. No,’ ho
says, ‘ there’s nothing fer it; yer’ll ’ave ter get a
norse an’ ride.’
“ ‘Ride a norse ! ’ I says, ‘why I never rid a
norse in me life.’
“‘Maybe,’ ’e. says, ‘but you’ll ’ave ter do
it now. After all, it ain’t so ’ard er job
as yer think, wonct yer aboard ; all yer ’ave
ter do is ter keep ’er ’ead straight. Yer steer with
two lanyards which is made fast ter the anamil’s
’ead, port an’ starbud, like the yoke-lines of er
gig or pullin’ skift. Yer’d better come ’an ’ave er
look at the chart; I’ll lay down er course fer yer
ter steer. ’
“ Well, I goes aft ter the ole man’s cabin ; ’e ’as
'is chart er the coast between Port Stephens an’
Sydney, an’ ’e was workin’ out a course fer me.
“ ‘There,’he says, quite proud like, ‘yer steer
Sou’ West, quarter West, by compass, fer about
five mile, an’ yer orter fetch-up on the big beach ;
then yer keep fullerin’ it round till yer pick up
the Nobby’s light; I’ll lend yer a spare compass,
ter work by, an’ yer’ll feel at ’ome, in a manner er
speakin’. Yer’ll want an advance, I s’pose,’ he
says (’e alwus was er good-’earted cove, were ole
Miller).
“ ‘ Yes,’ I says, ‘I ain’t got no money.’
“ ‘ Well,’ he says, ‘ I’ll let yer have two-ten.’
“ ‘ Make it three-ten,’ I says, ‘’cos I’ll want er
few bob fer sayin’ goodbye ter the ’ands, an’ I
’opes too that yer’ll come ter the pub yerself an’
see me get under weigh.’
“ ‘I don’t mind if I do,’ he says. ‘ Besides,’ he
says, ‘ it’s me duty to be there, as I might ’ave
ter give evidence in case anythink ’appened ter
yer ; I orter be ready in case of an ink west or
somethink er that sort. Yer can take it from me
that a man can’t be too careful in this world.’
“ Well, when the boys for’ard ’ears that I ’ad
an advance, they all says they’d like fer ter see me
drop me moorin’s, an’ so we all goes ashore. I
takes me oilskins an’ sea-boots an’ sou’-wester, an’
me knife an’ marlinspike, er course; likewise,
about four fathom er spare rope an’ the ole man’s
compass. We goes up ter the pub, an’ strikes a
bargain with the publican for the charter of a
norse; I stiperlated for an ole ’orSe, an’ I found
out afterwards that ’e’d give what I’d asked for.
“’Owsomever, we ’ad a good many drinks at
the pub, as the boys wanted ter sympertise with
me ; leastwise, all the unmarried ones ; cookey
were a married man, an’ ’e got pretty full. ’E tole
me, private-like, that ’e wished ’e ’ad my luck, an’
said ’e would ride ter Melbourne on er billy-goat
ter go ter ’is ole woman’s fun’ral. What with
payin’ fer the drinks an’ the ’orse, I tell you I
didn’t ’ave much er the advance left when I come
ter get away. But the boys made me a present of
er big bottle er rum, asastand-byonthetnp, though
at the end I ’ad ter pay fer it ter save a' tight.
The send-off took so long that it was sundown
before I got under weigh ; but it were er real good
send-off, an’ no mistake ; they couldn’t er done it
better if they was buryin’ me.
“ ’Owsomever, they brings the ’orse round ter
the front er the pifb, an’ I makes me dunnage fast
an’ starts ter climb aboard. I ’ad a bit er trouble
about this, ’cos I ups an’ puts the wrong foot in
the stir-up, or whatever yer calls it, an’ when I’m
on the ole animal’s back, why, I’m stern first.
Anyways, I manages ter get the right way round,
an’ then I takes er good, steady pull on the lan-
yards, but the ole ’orse, ’e starts goin’ astern;
then the publican tells me ter ease up an’ give ’er
’er’ead, an’ ’e starts beltin’ ’er behind ; she begins
ter make ’eadway, an’ there’s me sittin’ aloft in
full command.
“’Owsomever, I ad ter work mighty’ard ter
keep ’er movin’; she kep’ wantin’ to turn round
an’ go back. I wouldn’t er minded doin’ this
meself, but after a send-off like that, I ad ter go ;
so I keeps workin’ ’er along, but she never ’ad
more’n steerage-way on.
“I kep ter the road fer a while, but I found
when I looked at the compass that I was gettin’
off the course the old man ad laid down fer me ;
so I ’ad to get me bearin’s an’ make me course
good again. Soon after I dropped the road I
picked up some rough goin’, an' things got mighty
bad; it was rainin’ be this time, an black as the
inside of a nigger cabin boy. The ole ’orse kep’
stumblin’ every now an’ again, an’ every time she
makes a lurch forward, I goes Over ’er bows—yes,
clean over ’er bows.
“ ’Owsomever, I kep’ ’old er the lanyards, ’cos I
knewd it wouldn’t do fer to part company with
me craft; every time I falls overboard I fetches up
on the ground, an’ every time I fetches up on the
ground I ’as er nip at the rum. Yes, I ’ad er nip
at the rum,” Bill repeated, looking at me very
hard.
I did the proper thing under the circum-
stances, and he got away with another half-glass
neat.
“I tell you,” he went on, wiping liis mouth
with the back of his hand; “I tell you it was
mighty ’ard work gettin’ aboard with rue oiley an,
me sea-boots on; an’ besides, I kep’ forgettin
which foot to put in the stir-up. I found out after
tryin’ it fer a bit that the ole ’orse wouldn’t let me
climb up on ’er starboard- side—didn t seem used
to it, some’ows ; but she didn’t mind me t yin’ on
the port side; ther’s tricks in every trade, even
with a norse. ’Owsomever, I kep’ goin’ till the
middle watch, but what with the contrary wind
an’ the rough goin’, I didn’t make much ’eadway ;
besides, I was beginning to lose me temper with
failin’ overboard so much, an' when I’d gone over
’er bows an’ fetelied-up, all standin’, on the
ground fer about the twenty-first time, I says,
‘ Blarst the ole woman ; let ’er die.’ And I moors
the ’orse be the ’ead to er tree with the lanyards
an’ passes the bit er spare line round ’er, ’mid-
ships, passes it over her back, takin’ a ’alf ’itch
’round her tail, an’ bowses-up pretty tight to
another tree : she were moored stem an’ stern.
Then I finishes the rum, an’ turns-in to wait for
daylight.
“ When I wakes up in the mornin’ I finds the
sun well up. I must er slep’ pretty hard, ’cos I
never ’eard the ole ’orse carryin’ on tryin’ ter get
away. I think I must er made ’er fast a bit too
tight, ’cos the ground was tore up all round ’er,
and her planks was a bit rubbed where the line
’ad chafed her. ’Owsomever, she couldn’t do
much with mi/ knots.”
“Well, I gets under weigh agen, but I comes to
the conclusion that I must ’ave got off me course
durin’ the night. . I ’ad a. few sea-biskits an’ a bit
er ’ard tack, which kep’ me goin’ fer food, but
I'd er give all I ’ad in the world for a nip ’er rum :
it was a good job for the ole woman I didn’t meet
her then, the way I was feolin’. Yes, I’d er give
er lot for a drop,” said Bill, looking hard at my
bottle, standing on the deck.
When he had done with it, the level of its
contents had been considerably lowered.
“ Durin’ the mornin,” he went on with in-
creased vivacity and a strengthened breath, “ the
ole ’orse tried to part company with me sev’ral
times ; but whenever I come off, I kep’ ’old er the
lanyards; besides, I ’ad a turn er the spare line
round mo as er preventer in case the lanyards
carried away. At last she managed to lay down
on me when I was on the ground, an’ I ’ad a lot
er trouble gettin’ clear ; I couldn’t get ’er up agen,
couldn’t get a move out of ’er. I thought she was
done for, an’ so I left ’er, but I ’adn’t gone far when
I sees ’er get up, lively as a buck weevil; I runs
back, but d’yer think I could catch ’er ? Not
much. Wonct, I got ’er be the tail, but she
knocked the wind out er me with ’er ’eels, an’
that was enough for me ; so I makes up me mind
to walk. 1 can tell you, I ’ad a ’ell of er time ;
the only comfort I ’ad was ter curse the missus
for talcin’ it inter ’er ’ead to die when I wasn t in
►Sydney ’arbor. I slep’ under a tree that night
with notliink but a big thirst to keep me warm.
Tor tell ycr the ’onest truth, I was so thirsty when
I woke m the mornin’ that I ’ad ter ’ave a drink
er water. I ’ad ter ’ave a drink er water,” Bill-
repeated, with much emphasis.
I couldn’t allow a reflection like that to pass.
Bill returned the bottle—the bottle, and nothing
but the bottle ; and continued aromatically :
“ ’Owsomever, to make a long story more
shorter, I found a ’ouse at last, an’ the people
made me comfortable fer a day er two. The end
of it was I managed ter get inter Newcastle about
five er six days after I lef’ Port Stephens. An’ I
see the Maud Eneryetter cornin’ up the ’arbor
the day I got ’ome. When I went aboard, the ole
man, ’e tole me that the ’orse ’ad turned-up before
they ’ad left, an’ they thought I’d gone down ; ’e
was flyin’ ’is flag ’alf-mast fer me coinin’ down, an’
coolcey was wearin’ a suit er mine.”
“ And how was the wife when you got home ? ”
I asked.
“ ’Ow was she ?•” answered Bill, hotly. “’o?e
was she ? Why, she was out doin’ er day’s
wasliin’ !”
QUILLET.
A Fresh in the Creek.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MOTHER had a feeling that something
was going to happen ; so she said after-
wards, anyhow. She hadn’t noticed an
ant all day, and sugar and jam stood about as if
ants had never been.
Dad came in to lunch, his face as long as a
horse’s, and himself as cross as two sticks. He
couldn’t find any grass—no one had any. The
blessed sheep could starve for all he cared. Every-
one was growling and hard-worked. The creek
was nearly dry, and the stock in the home pad-
docks had to be watered. Half the sheep had
been moved to the Boggy Plains, and men were
working everywhere, to replace fences burnt by
bush fires. If anyone thought of rain, it was
despairingly, as of something they had seen, but
hardly hoped to see again.
Dad was having his “ four o’clock ” when he
said he thought the days must be drawing in. It
seemed to be getting dark.
And then it rained ; not ordinary rain, but rain
that lifted the wood-heap and circular saw-mill,
and floated them gaily to the creek. Dull, red
rivers poured from the road, and tumbling down
the gullies came black Niagaras. A distant roar-
ing could be heard. Jim reckoned it was the
creek coming down, but Dad said that was rot.
It hadn’t been raining more than 20 minutes or
so, and that couldn’t raise the creek.
We stood on the verandah and watched. The
roaring grew louder. The creek was coming. The
creek had come—a huge seething, stinking mass,
rushing everything before it; carrion, trees, logs ;
the ash from the bush-fires leaping on its surface.
Jim began to make wagers. Fred Moore’s red
gate and part of our fence went by at a fierce
pace, and breathlessly we watched a new shed at
the back of the jackeroo’s hut. Higher and
higher rose the creek, rolling now like a foul sea.
The stench was horrible.
Dad said we ought to warn the jackeroo, who
i; English and silly. The water continued to rise,
The jackeroo stood on the bank regarding it
dreamily. Dad got into a woolpack and made
for him. The creek divided them. Dad sang-out
and waved his arms. The jackeroo politely tried
to hear. Dad waved his arms some more and
seemed to be bursting himself. His face got very
red. The creek roared louder. Dad pointed to
the shed. The jackeroo smiled, and moved to his
verandah as a smellful wave washed his feet The
shed began to dance. It gave three little giddy
drunken heaves, and started for the Snowy River.
Dad was wild. Why the dickens couldn’t the
Silly coon have roped the shed to the house ! He
didn’t have his out-houses sailing away like Noah’s
Ark.
Fred Moore’s dead sheep tossed by. Dad
didn’t think the poor chap had so many burnt.
The dark mass of water grew broader. Surely
that was our cow-shed ! Behind the shed came
Strawberry, the new milker. Now Dad was
indeed an excited man. Along the bank he tore,
trying vainly to keep pace with the cow. Her
head was down, and Jim made more bets.
The rain ceased, and a rainbow glowed on the
hills. No one thought of Dad—we were too upset
about the cow. The creek fell, nearly as fast as it
had risen, and in a couple of hours only a thick
muddy stream ran along its bed.
The sun was sinking when Jim said he’d go and
ask about the cow. At dusk we saw him trudging
slowly along the road, guiding the homestead
dray. Several men accompanied him. He had
on the dray Dad and the cow. Dad’s head was
resting on Strawberry’s neck, and he looked very
sick and shaken. They had found him near the
cow, caught in some barbed wire.
Mother’s face was tragic, and her touch very
gentle as she bound Dad’s wounds. Next day
there was fresh beef for all hands, and another
calf to poddy. It was, too, nearly a case with
Dad. And we couldn’t have eaten him.

“ Hagram ” : Re £lO allowance to half-
time teachers for forage. A reliable policeman
told me that his neddy’s keep cost nearly £2q
yearly ; arid he doesn’t use the animal more than
twice a week. Also the police are found in horse
and turn-out, whereas the poor bush teacher has to
find his own. Shoeing, alone, makes a hole in the
tenner.
The other day a lady living in Kent-street
was brought before Sydney District Court oni a
charge of having violently assaulted a lodger with
a poker. Evidence was given to the etiec ithat
prosecutor was singing Christmas caro Jiwhen he
was assaulted. “It’s a poor heart that never
rejoices,” remarked his Honor, cryptically, and
dismissed the case. It has been already judicially
ruled in Victoria that a proper Christmas-box lor
the law to give a young Australian is the privi-
lege to bash a Chinaman with impunity (a young
fellow convicted of assault on a Chinaman was
released, “as it was Christmas Day ”). Now, is it
to be taken as law that rejoicing may legitimately
take the form of hitting a man with a poker i
Two manufacturers have told the Tariff
Commission something about dumping, bait is
brought here in wheat-ships as ballast; in one
ease the shipowners had actually paid the salt-
makers to be allowed to carry the article, instead
of it paying freight. “ When, having swamped
the market, the local manufacturer is crushed out,
they will raise the price,” he said. Another, in
the artificial-manure trade, complained of tlie
same practice. “The acid from which super-
phosphate is made in Belgium is a by-product of
the zinc industry (some of it Australia s zinc, by
the way). The Belgian manufacturers had at
first dumped their product into England, but, to
save their industry, the English makers had
arranged with the Belgians to seek some simpler
folk to exploit, and they chose Australia. Both
these witnesses advocated the Canadian remedy
the imposition of a special duty equal to the differ-
ence between the prime cost of the article in the
country of its manufacture and the average whole-
sale selling-price in the country whither it is
exported. The manure-maker specially pro-
tested against cheap-labor Japan unloading her
surplus on the Australian market at £1 a ton less
than the local ruling rate.

Mr. Albert I. Bennett, Sylvia Cottage, 6 George-street, St. Peters,
this city, states “My kidneys started to give me trouble some time ago.
I had severe backache and urinary disorder. When I sat down my back
would get so bad that I could hardly get up again*. I used a good deal of
medicine without obtaining any benefit, when I thought I would give
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a trial. My father had used them with first-
rate results. He is 74, and they keep him right; and, besides that, some
fellows working in the sheds with me have.had some remarkable cures with
this medicine. One (a friend of mine) was so bad he could not throw a hay
rope up, and the pills cured him. I obtained a box, and after that used
three more, and lam now quite cured. It is some months ago now, and I
am still well. They are grand pills for kidney troubles. And man with
backache cannot work very well; but he will work all right when he has
used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”

Eczema.
Nothing spoils a good disposition quicker,
Nothing taxes a man’s patience
Like any irritation of the skin.
Piles almost drive you crazy.
All day they make you miserable.
All night they keep you awake.
Just the same with Eczema.
Such miseries are daily decreasing,
People are learning they can be cured,
Learning the merit of Doan’s Ointment.
Plenty of proof that Doan’s Ointment will
cure
Piles, Eczema, or any irritation of the skin.
Read the testimony of a Sydney citizen
Mrs. Grace, 18 Glebe-street, Glebe, this
city, says:-—“I could give a guarantee to
anybody as to the efficiency of Doan’s Oint-
ment in cases of Eczema. My husband
suffered frightfully with this trouble. It
was on his feet, and was so bad he had to go
to the hospital about it. He came from the
institution as bad as he went to it, and then
we got Doan’s Ointment. This remedy be-
gan to give ease as soon as we applied it, and
two pots cured him. This occurred four
years ago, and he has been free of it ever
since. Before he used Doan’s Ointment he
would be weeks and weeks unable to put his
feet to the ground, and suffering terrible
torture all the time. I never believed much
in any medicine until I saw the way Doan’s
Ointment acted in his case. It is a splendid
preparation, and I advise sufferers to use it.”
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all diseases
of the skin, eczema, piles, hives, sores, insect
bites, chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe,
and very effective. Very often two or three
pots have cured chronic cases which have
resisted other remedies for years.

AFTER the years of waiting,
After the years of pain,
Now when the birds are mating,
Dear, you have come again.
Only a summer and autumn,
Only a winter gone ?
Ah. you could never have changed so much,
Even to look upon !
Girl with the unbound tresses,
Oponest look and smile—
Ah, how my whole heart blesses
Her that I knew for a while !
Days of the foolish schoolgirl ?
Never I’ll call them so;
Glad were the days till your girlhood went—
Why should it ever go ?
Not in a year, a season ?
Ah, you are apt to learn
Secrets of women’s reason,
Secrets that scorch and burn;
Secrets that sear the heart out,
Fix on the face a mask ;
Secrets that smother the girl you were,
And make life’s pleasure a task.
Sore were I to grieve you,
Give you a cause for pain ;
But—l can scarce believe you
Now you are come again :
New is that air of strangeness,
New the unwilling smile—
Ah, you can never have lost your youth
And find \vhat they all find—guile ?
She:
I left, a youthful maiden;
I was not worldly-wise ;
And all I thought I spoke in words,
Or told it with my eyes.
My heart was not a woman’s,
His heart was older far ;
He knew—but how was I to know
What men and women are ?
I’ve found it in a season ;
My girlhood in a day
Has taken wing, and with it borne
My unreserve away.
Though this be woman’s wisdom,
It is not woman’s guile ;
I’ve learnt that more than merry laugh
May follow on a smile.
I feel so much another.
My heart has opened wide ;
And when my girl-days passed away,
What wonder if I cried ?
I cried —not all for sorrow ;
Oh, if he only knew !
Or if this woman’s strange reserve
Would tell me what to do.
Though I’m no more a schoolgirl,
I grieve if he is pained ;
I only guard what, were it lost,
Could never be regained.
If he prove still unaltered,
And love the schoolgirl yet;
Ah ! he shall find her heart the same—
That she did not forget.

“ ~IVTOW then, jump up, and round-up
them cows, you ! ” ordered the red,
bristly-haired man as he turned over to
have a few more hours sleep. He spoke to his
twelve-year-old daughter, who slept, not too
soundly, on the floor of the adjoining room.
“ Why, the clock’s only just struck three ! ” said
Kitty.
“Never mine that there blarsted clock! It’s
never right.”
Kitty was not sure. She poked a piece of mud
and straw plaster from between the rough slabs of
the two-roomed shanty and looked out.
The hens stood on the roost contemplatively.
They, like herself, were not quite sure. The boss
cliook flapped his wings and jumped off. Kitty
then jumped up. “ I wish there ’ad never been
no cows ! ” she muttered as she picked up the
frock that had served for a pillow during the night.
“ Ain’ cher gone yet?” bawled Red Bristles.
“ Puttin’ on me boots,” replied Kitty.
“Ye don’ want boots ! The doo spiles ’em.”
Kitty knew a thing or two, and so quietly took
her boots under her arm and opened the safe-door to
get a chunk of bread and corned beef before going.
The creaking of the safe-door informed Kitty’s
mother that the piece of corned beef she was keep-
ing for Dad’s breakfast was in danger.
“ Don’ touch that bit ermeat, Kitty !” she said,
quietly.
“ Gome out er that safe and git after them cows
or I’ll shift yer! ” bawled Red Bristles, as he
jumped out of bed and made for Kitty.
The green-hide hinges that held the heavy door
needed a fresh supply of goanna fat, and it was
with difficulty that Kitty got out. She thought
she smelt his breath, but she was sure she felt his
unshod hoof.
“ Put down them there boots ! Yer don’t want
boots, I tell yer ! ” he yelled.
Kitty threw down her boots and called Nailer,
her dog. Nailer’s value was known only to Kitty.
Many.a run he had saved her in rounding-up the
cows. He obeyed no orders but hers, and for this
crime Dad had threatened, on several occasions,
when Kitty was not about and the cows were in
mischief, to shoot him.
“ Don’cher dorg them cows, d’ y’ ’ear!” he
ordered, as he turned to go back to bed.
Kitty did not promise. She knew he would
kick up a bigger row if the milk was not ready for
the factory when he was. He liked to be there
first, so as to get his full share of the skim milk for
the poddies, and if he were late Kitty suffered for
any deficiency.
“Ain’ cher ready?” he said an hour or two
later, as he backed the milk cart up against the
shed.
“Jus’ finishin’ Violet,” replied Kitty.
“Is this all ther milk them nine cows gives ? ”
he grumbled as he looked into the milking-can.
“That’s you dorgin’ ’em ! Jiss let me kitch yer
dorgin’ ’em agen an’ FU'fleece yer, m lazy hussy !
I)’ y’ )ear he added. “Kitch ole er this ’ere,”
he said, as he grabbed the handle of the can,
“an’ ’elp me lift it inter the cart. An’ turn them
th ere flaming bullicks back ter the mountains, an’
put ther cows inter the loosun paddick, an’ mind
’em ’orf ther corn till 1 come back. Come and
open ther gate,” he roared as lie drove away at
full speed to get ahead of Paddy Mulligan, who
h id just slashed into his horses to get ahead of
Dad.
Kitty sent Nailer to drive back the bullocks, and
turned to go home for her breakfast.
“Bring a armful er wood with yer,” sang-out
her mother.
“No fire?” said Kitty.
“No ! I’il make it, though, while you run for a
bucket of water.”
“Run like lightnen’, Kitty,” said Mother as
Kitty returned with the water ; “ ther cows’r at
th’ ’ay stack. Put ’em in ther loosun, Kitty, an’
I’ll sen’ Paddy with yer breakfus’ when the kittle
biles.”
Kitty scampered after the cows with the full
responsibility of their doings on her mind. She
sat on a stump, minding them and holding a dirty,
milk-stained geography-book in her hand.
“ Clarence, Micclay, ’Asten’, Mannen’, Kurroor,
’Unter, ’Awkesbury, Shoalhaven ! ” she repeated
aloud. She was naming the cows after the rivers,
so that she might remember her geography lesson
and escape the humiliating punishment of stand-
ing in a corner if she went to school in the after-
noon.
Dad stepped to talk to Mulligan, and forgot
about the time and the cows until Mulligan pulled
out the big silver watch that he wore fastened
to a plaited chain of Kurrajong bark, and said : “I
mus’ be gittin’ awn.”
* * • *
“What th’ ’ell you wimmin thinkin’ ’bout
not ter turn them cows outer ther loosun ’fore
this ? Tli’ll bust right nuff, every blasted one uv
’em,” said Dad to Mother as he drove up to the
shanty.
He bawled to Kitty to fetch them out and put
them in the yard, but Kitty did not hear him. She
still held her book, repeating the names of the
rivers. She did not see her father coming up
behind her until he roared out at her, grabbed her
book, tore it in two, and threw it on the ground.
“Carn’ cher see ther cows bustin’, yer useless
yanimal! Drive ’em out this minit 1 ”
The gate was opened and the cows, with hides
well stretched, and looking neither to the left nor
to the right, walked past the corn as if they did
not know it was good to eat. Two of the best
milkers lay down, put their noses to the ground,
and started puffing. Dad bawled to Mother to
come and help him to put sticks in their mouths.
When this was done Kitty and Nailer were
ordered to run them about.
“ Yer better see to the poddies now,” said Dad,
after the cows were out of danger. Kitty had
twenty poddies to feed. She poured some milk
into a wooden trough for the older calves, and
while they drank the milk and sucked each others’
ears, Kitty fed the young ones out ,of a bucket.
She immersed her hand in a bucket of milk,
leaving a couple of fingers projecting upwards, so
that by sucking them the poddies would drink
the milk.
When Dad bought the poddies he said to Kitty :
“They’ll make yer fingers nice an’ lorng for a
pehanna if ever yer git married ! ”
“How many days ’ave yer been this week?”
he asked, as Kitty ate her dinner.
“Three 1” said Kitty ; “an’ the master said I
wus behind.”
“ Well, yer better go tilers evenin’, an’ ask
’im ter let yer out at 3 o’clock, cus I wan’ yer ter
go an’ look for Nance. I think she’s got a calf,”
said Dad. “Don’fergit to put ther cows up in
the burr paddick ’fore yer go,” he added.
“ Clarence, Micclay,” said Kitty, as she
skipped off down the hill to school.
“ ’ Urry ’ome ; d’y ’ear ? ” said Dad.
“ Right; Clarence, Micclay, ’Asten’,’’said Kitty.
“ Three o’clock ? ” said the schoolmaster ; “why,
it’s half-past two now. Get your slate and write
out the rivers of New South Wales.”
The school was almost within speaking distance
of Kitty’s home; and, as the teacher had forgotten
her request, he was reminded at a-quarter-to-four
by Dad bawling, “ Kit-tee !”
Kitty arrived home at 5 o’clock, with Nance
and another finger-sucker.
“Now, ’urry up,” said Dad, “an’ round-up ther
cows, an’ milk ’em. An’ don’t dorg ’em, either.”
Kitty was tired. She ordered Nailer to “fitch
’em up ! ’’
Nailer rounded-up the cows, and drove them
galloping to the milk-yard.
While Kitty sat on a log, picking burrs out of
her feet, she heard the report of a gun, followed
by a yelp from Nailer. She hurried home, in
response to her father’s call.
“ I thought I tole yer not ter dorg them cows? ”
said the red-headed, fiery-eyed man, as he ap-
proached Kitty with a branch of a bush, well
stripped of its leaves.
Kitty, turning to run away, noticed her faithful
helpmate lying dead on the grass. She gave a
pitiful wail, stopped, and, facing her father, said,
stubbornly :
“Go’n ! Flog away. Yer can kill me if yer
like ! ”
The man dropped his switch and walked away.
P.B.
“Sardonyx”: No doubt The Bulletin
(2/3/ 05) hit the nail on the head when it attri-
buted the non-employment of white labor by the
P. and O. Co. to consider it ion for the “nabob”
passenger, the lowest-paid of whom has been
accustomed in India to a swarm of servile atten-
dants. ' Take, for instance, a subaltern. His
monthly pay is about 250 rupees ; yet he will ha e
the following :—Bearer (valet), R. 6 per month ;
khitmagur (waiter), R. G; syce, (groom), R. 4;
grass-cuter, R. 4; bheesti (water-carrier), R. 4;
dhobi (washerman), R. 5; nappi (barber), R. 4;
mehtar (sweeper and scavenger), R. 3; punkah-
wallahs (summer time only), 2 at R. 4 ; tattah-
wallah, R. 4. Total servants, 10 ; wages, R. 4f—-
(rupee is worth about Is. 3d). Servants provide
themselves with food and clothes, except thatsorre
officers provide bearer, khitmagur, and sycewiih
turban and kummarbund (waist-girdle or band) of
their “ colors.” One servant will not do the w< rk
of another. If you asked the bearer to sweep the
room, he would not do it, and you might threaten
to discharge him, he still would be obdurate. He
would, however, call the mehtar and see it
attended to. No other servant would bring water
except the bheesti, and so on. By-the-way, the
mehtars, who sweep out house, stable, and out-
houses, are pariahs, or outcasts. Their country-
men would not partake of any food or use any
utensil which they have touched. It is chiefly
men of this class who ramble around Australia as
hawkers.


Covered with Boils
Ayer's Sarsaparilla Geres Severe Case of Impure Blood. Also Im-
proves tire Sight. A Blood-Builder.

w.
m
Mr. James Johnson, engineer, of
South Forbes, New South Wales,
sends us his photograph, and says:
“My whole body being covered
with boils, I was induced to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla (through an advertise-
ment in the local paper), and after
taking one bottle I am entirely free
from any eruption whatever. I also
found it beneficial to the eyesight,
being a strengthener not only of the
blood, but of the sight. I can and will
jonfidently recommend this valuable
blood-purifier to all suffering from
similar complaints as myself.”
This is g splendid testimonial, and
we trust it may prove of great benefit
to you. giving you renewed confidence
in this grand family medicine.
“■Ayer's Sarsaparilla makes tlie blood pure.” This is a very short sen-
tence ; yet it may mean everything to you, even life itself. “Everything
depends upon the blood.” This is another short sentence/and yet how
true it is. When the blood is pure and rich, then the nerves are strong
and steady, the brain is clear and active, and the skin is free from rashes
and eruptions. If you are not in the best of health, get this grand medicine
at once.. You will feel its tonic, strengthening effects before a couple of
days have passed. \. 1
Be sure you get “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. The old reliable Sarsaparilla.
Do not run any risk. Look out for imitations.
