3A COLLEGE STREET, SYDNEY.
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading college?
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
lion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE FOUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
geious, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
-understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will bo found a list of carefully-pre
pared questions, which will, in all probability
assist you materially in describing your ailment
l)r. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies
and never prescribes mercury under any circum
stances. The moment letters arc carefully per
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

Dr. PATERSON has been engaged for over
Twenty Years in the study and practice of
QHRONIC, [\J ERVOUS,
and
Special Diseases
Of Men and Women in the leading Medical Schools and
Hospitals of Great Britain, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and
in private practice. Formerly House Surgeon to the
Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Lock Hospitals.
No a 'dical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can he compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old.
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism,impure blood, weakeningdischarges, impaired
vigor,sterility, premature decay,stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interrupti< ■ to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of
2s. Gd. he will forward his book on the “Mai
Generative Function in Health and Disease,'

DR.KELLYMATBE CONSULTED FREE OF COST, BY SUFFERERS FROM
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN COMPLAINTS.
DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER
ARB UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HR HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OF ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HI'S REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR, KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE,
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.
IF YOU ARE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER YOU REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.
ASK YOURSELF THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS
AM I SUBJECT TO PALPITATION OF THE HEART, FLUSHES OF
HEAT, DRYNESS OF THE SKIN, PALE, SALLOW COMPLEXION,
RESTLESSNESS AT NIGHT, A DESPAIR OF RECOVERY, ANXIETY
WITHOUT CAUSE, FEAR OF DEATH, TENDENCY TO SUICIDE, LACK
OF MENTAL CAPACITY, NERVOUS IRRITABILITY, NERVOUS PROS-

original character, he cast a regretful glance
at the “depression which lias recently
afflicted Australia in common with the rest
of the civilised world.” The same allusion,
in one form or another, turns up in the
speech of every other Governor in the Aus-
tralasian provinces, and of almost every
potentate throughout the whole civilised
earth. It has appeared with a weary itera-
tion for many years —so many, in fact, that
nobody now living can remember when the
depression first began. Yet even now it is
the fashion to allude to it as a mere
temporary phase—a passing circumstance
which, in the ordinary course of events, must
provide its own remedy, and to assume that
prosperity is the normal condition of society,
and depression only an excrescence upon the
surface. Therefore, there is a constant
desire to supply a reason for the depression,
and in Maoriland it is described by the Tory
press as a regretable phenomenon which
arises from the conduct of the Ball an ce
Government in “driving capital out of the
country ; ” and in New South Wales the
eternal W. E. Abbott writes to the daily
papers to point out that the existing stagna-
tion is entirely owing to strikes and sinful
combinations among the proletariat, and the
equally eternal Epps explains that the way
to salvation lies in establishing the system
of a “ vote for Thrift.” In Queens-
land, again, the Griffilwraith Cabinet
announces that the absence of Kanaka
labour is the sole cause of the trouble, and
throughout Australia in general there is a
further hazy and undetinable impression
that the want of more public works and the
falhug-ofl' in the “ influx of foreign capital ”
are in some way responsible for everything.
Meanwhile in Europe the widespread woo is
ascribed to too much “ congestion ” in large
cities, and in America it is set down to in-
dustrial troubles, and in other parts of this
depressed globe it is charged to a variety of
local causes. Everywhere the same assump-
tion is present, that prosperity is the natural
and reasonable state of things as society is
now organised, and that “ commercial de-
pression ” is a derangement of the course of
nature and a departure from orthodox con-
ditions generally.
* * %
Therefore the poor all over the world are
urged to wait in patience till the depression
passes away, after which a commercial mil-
lennium will start and all will be well. It is
a shadoivy and impersonal thing, that pro-
vailing stagnation—like the devil, and the
“act of God,” and similar influences it is
always out of reach ; and so long as the world
believes in it much trouble is saved. But
what hardly any one seems to realise is that
the depression is a permanent institution—
that it is the rule while prosperity is the
exception—in other words, that there is no
genuine depression at all, for the term signi-
fies that things are below their customary N
level, whereas in reality they are merely on
their natural basis, and any rise above that
point is not a return of prosperity, but only
a sudden financial drunkenness. The world, in
fact, is in its normal condition—the condition
which it will occupy till the end of time, unless
land-monopoly and free competition and the
other evils of the present social system are
abolished, and humanity starts on an entirely
new basis. The “ unemployed question,”
and the “submerged tenth,” the uni-
versal famine, and the eternally recurring
problem of relief works, the soup-kitchens
and the industrial troubles and the shortage
in the national accounts, and the perpetual
demand for borrowed money to “ absorb
surplus labour ” and all the rest of the world’s
difficulties are not owing to any temporary
falling-off in trade and industry; they arc part
of its very existence, and to wait for an
“industrial revival” as a remedy for these
conundrums is as hopeless and purposeless as
to wait for the resurrection. The return of
prosperity and the event which Micawber
vainly hoped might turn up are equally
shadowy, and, moreover, neither of them
ever come. It is assumed, in an indefinite
sort of way, that there has been and, in the
ordinary course of things, will be again, if
people only wait long enough, a time when
every industrious man can find work and
food, but this assumption is altogether base-
less. The ordinary course of things, as
society is now constituted, is that from one-
tenth to one-half of the human race shall
live perpetually on the verge of starvation.
It is mere waste of words to call this state of
affairs “ depression.” The world is always
depressed, and the only variety it affords is
that some parts are more depressed than
others.
# # *
The effort to prove that extreme poverty
is a mere accident arising from temporary
local causes is an inevitable failure. The
troubles of Maoriland, as already mentioned,
are ascribed by the monopolist press to the
alleged fact that the policy of the Ballanoe
Cabinet has “driven capital from the
country,” but even assuming this to be true
the capital must have gone somewhere, and
the place that it has gone to shows no visible
signs of improvement. The woes of Queens-
land are said to be owing in great part to the
want of population to develope the sugar
industry and the other resources of the
country ; and by an upside-down process of
reasoning those of the poorer classes in Eng-
land are said to be owing to the presence of
too much population, and this population is
declared to be starving for want of land to
settle upon, and meanwhile more than one-
third of the arable lands in Great Britain are
lying waste and tenantless for want of any-
one to settle upon them. The bankruptcy
of the middle classes in the same distressful
land is entirely owing to the fact that they
rashly lent some £300,000,000 to sundry
defaulting South American states, and are
unable to get it back, but the states which
have absorbed all this money are also bank-
rupt, so by this reasoning the people who
have the money and the people who do not
have it come equally to grief. The difficulties
of ’the United States arise from industrial
agitation and the low price of grain, and
those of Russia from the high price of grain,
and the fact that the industrial classes dare
not agitate lest they should be sent to
Siberia. The poverty of the South African
provinces is owing to the falling-qft' in
the diamond-fields, and this is held
to be sufficient to account for the
fact that they are poorer now than many
other countries which never possessed any
diamond-fields at all. The Northern Ter-
ritory is languishing because it is short of
Chinamen and coolies, and India and China
are both in difficulties because they are not
short of Chinamen and coolies. And over
and above these alleged local causes, they are
infected by the temporary depression of
their neighbours, and no one seems to realise
that, with a very few exceptions, the world
has always been depressed since the begin-
ning of history, and bids fair to keep on
being depressed to the end.
* * *
Almost every time the human race has
quitted the safe, but dismal, path of depres-
sion it has come to worse grief as the im-
mediate consequence. 'I he Victorian land-
boom was a period of sudden affluence, for
then nearly everybody exchanged his gold
for debentures or other alleged securities,
and the man who had the gold, and the man
who had the debentures, both reckoned
them as solid assets, and the national wealth
was much enhanced thereby. The deben-
tures are mostly gone by this time, and as
the natural consequence the old, familiar
depression has returned. The period of the
railway mania in England was also an out-
burst of prosperity, and great was the fall
thereof. The last outbreak of affluence in
Europe was the era of foreign loans, when
for a brief period all the world was com-
paratively prosperous ; the borrowers
because they had the cash, and the
lenders because they had the paper securi-
ties and imagined that they would have
the interest. Now, both parties are
practically insolvent; the temporary delirium
which is called progress is over, and the
orthodox, sane condition, which is defined
as commercial stagnation, has returned once
more. There is no possibility of accounting
for this condition upon the hackneyed theory
of the departure of capital, for all the capital
the earth ever possessed is still somewhere
upon its surface, and it cannot depart unless
it flies .off into space. Neither can it be
ascribed to “ industrial agitation,” according
to the favourite manner of the Conservative
press ; despite the Queensland shearers
strike, for instance, the annual wool-crop
was despatched as usual, and the money
came back in the same old way, and the
total wealth of the province was not
diminished one iota. Moreover, the uni-
versal character of the existing poverty is a
sufficient proof that it arises from no mere
temporary or local influences. With the
single exception of France, and in a less
degree the United States, which may be
termed prosperous because they are much
less unprosperous than the average, there is
hardly a spot upon the entire globe which is
not suffering, more or less, from the same
trouble. Even the fierce competition of
modern industrialism is an insufficient ex-
planation ; if the world’s difficulties all arose
from competition, then there must be some-
where, at least, one successful competitor to
be found —the one who has come out on top.
It is difficult to realise a competitive system
in which everybody is undermost —a battle
in which both parties are defeated, and
nobody ever wins.

Ever since the first newspaper first existed
the Journalist of the period has alluded feel-
ingly to this same old evil, and has expressed
the same old hope that it would presently
pass away, and be succeeded by a period of
uninterrupted prosperity. He might as
well express a hope that Death would
presently die out, or that disease would
become extinct, or that eternity would fall
down dead and be no more heard of. The
depression goes on for ever, and even in its
prosperous periods the world is still depressed
—only being drunk and irresponsible it
isn’t aware of the fact. As long as land-
lordism exists the human race is burdened
with more liabilities than it can pay,
and remains poor as a consequence ;
it is possible, under a reasonably en-
lightened system, for every denizen of this
planet to support himself upon it, but when,
in addition, he has to pay x’ent for the planet
the load becomes too great for endurance.
In France, where the landlord is more nearly
abolished than in any other civilised land,
there may be found the nearest approach to
absolute prosperity that the world has yet
seen—but for the load of militarism the
France of to-day would be an earthly Para-
dise. In England, where landlordism is
seen in its worst and most offensive form,
and the burden of Freetrade is added to the
burden of rent, the national poverty is most
abject and most incurable. The Anglo-Saxon
is the Micawber of the human race ; he is
always waiting for something to turn up.
Though the present commercial stagnation
began about the period of the Heptarchy, he
still persuades himself that it is only a pass-
ing difficulty—an altogether unforeseen em-
barrassment somewhat akin to catarrh or
cold feet or any other minor evil to which
the human race is liable. Therefore he is
always floating a new loan in order to start
some fresh public works, and thus “absorb
surplus labour” until the financial clouds
roll by, or doing something of an equally
intelligent character. And he never by any
chance appears to realise that he might as
well wait till the Almighty Himself rolls by,
and that, while the present social system
lasts, the real meaning of the situation is
that the country is making a vain attempt to
stave things off till the millennium.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A New Financial Device.
Dear Bulletin, — At the present time, when
the old debentures floated some *25 or 30 years
ago arc steadily falling due, and the money
Avith which to repay them is a non-existent
quantity, and the British lender is practically
insolvent through the blind, unreasoning faith
with which he lent his money to Argentina and
other broken communities, and new loans are
unobtainable in England, Avhile even the con-
A r ersion of old ones is a matter of exceeding
difficulty, the great question of the day is lioav
to dispense Avith the entire race of London
financiers, and raise Avhat money is absolutely
needed in Australasia itself. Under these cir-
cumstances, I would suggest that every bank,
insurance company, and other joint-stock
financial institution doing business in' these
provinces Avhich lias, or professes to have, a
reserve fund, should be required to invest (say)
one-half of t hat fund in (government securities,
and deposit the said securities in the Supreme
Court as a guarantee that they really exist, and
have not been sold, pavvned, mortgaged, em-
bezzled, or otherwise made away with. These
bonds could bear interest, if necessary, at 4fj
per cent.; the chances are that, allowing for
discount, commission, brokerage, and the
enhanced rates iioav demanded in the British
money-market, Australia Avill soon have to pay
that amount to the English loan-monger in any
case. I do not suggest this as a means of
creating neAv liabilities—there are more than
enough in existence already ; but as a device,
whereby to raise money to pay off the old ones,
the plan lias sundry advantages. The principal
of th esc is that it Avill afford a reasonable
amount of protection to shareholders and de-
positors against their enemy the director, and
his brother in iniquity, Ananias, the auditor.
When these individuals show—as they invari-
ably do —a huge reserve on paper, they are
never called upon to produce any evidence that
it exists anywhere else than on paper; the
shareholders and creditors have merely the
assurance of the hired Ananias and his em-
ployer to that effect. When the explosion
comes, it generally proves that the alleged
reserve consists of dead men’s bills and the
I O U’s of men who never lived, of P.N.s signed
by miscellaneous bankrupts, of unsecured debts
owing by persons who , have quitted the
country with the police in their wake, and of
similar “ assets.” If it were provided bylaw
that 50 per cent, of the reserve, which every
joint-stock company shows in its balance-sheet,
should be invested in national securities in the
manner indicated, it would then become a
matter of certainty that half the alleged accu-
mulations, at all events, could be found when
wanted, and that would be about as much as
could reasonably be expected. Iso sane share-
holder or depositor ever hopes to find the whole
of a reserve fund ; the trouble, as things stand
at present, is that ho hardly ever finds any
of it. Then the company which could not
produce its alleged cash would have to acknow-
ledge openly that it had no reserve at all, and
would no longer be able to keep up a fictitious
aspect of prosperity, and to rook the public on
the strength thereof, by passing oft' its dis-
honoured cheques, and other waste-paper and
ancient rags, as accumulated profits. And if,
at the same time, the Australian Governments
would adopt the device—now practised in Eng-
land —of requiring all funds held in trust under
wills to be invested in Government bonds,
except when otherwise directed by the testator,
another convenient method of raising money
would be developed and—provided the bonds
were deposited in the Supreme Court—the
orphan would find his patrimony intact when he
cime of age a great deal oftener than he does at
present. These two schemes would benefit the
Government much and would benefit the public
still more. They arc urgently wanted, even if
the State made no profit out of them whatso-
ever, and the fact that they promise to fill a
woeful gap in the financial system is an additional
reason why they should be tried without delay.
—Yours, &c., Titus Salt.
A “ Cowardly Sentiment.”
The S.M. Herald, the organ of everybody
who is connected, no matter how distantly,
with the “ aristocracy,” publishes a bitter wail
because Home Secretary Matthews has finally
decided that Mrs. Osborne, the pearl-thief and
enterprising perjuress, must serve out her sen-
tence of nine months’gaol -which sentence, but
for her good looks and “social position,” might
easily have been seven to fourteen years. The
following is the most wailful part of the
Herald’s story -
There is so much cowardly sentiment indulged on such
questions that it is a daring tiling perhaps to say that the
penalty exacted from Mrs. Osborne in the outward form
of imprisonment should not be the same as that which
should be exacted from a charwoman. No doult she
deserved severe punishment. She committed an offence
not only against friendship and honour and honesty, but
an offence against the law, of the most dangerous kind ;
for of all crimes probably perjury is that which strikes
most heavily against the foundations of justice, and tends
most to shake the stability of social life. Admitting even
that the period of imprisonment imposed is much shorter
than that usually attached to such a serious crime, it is
possible to conceive that the punishment which she has
been called to endure is more than would be involved in
three years imprisonment to the charwoman. Indeed, the
mere imprisonment is but a small portion of the suffering
inflicted, if it has not been even a relief to her to he
separated for a time from the world. The humiliation of
the conviction, the social ruin of her life, the disgrace
and the suffering which she has brought on some
very dear to her, must, to a refined and
sensitive gentlewoman, be as painful as physical
torture at the stake ; and from these the typical char-
woman, if we can imagine such a one, would be almost
entirely free. Simple conviction and immediate pardon
would have involved punishment to Mrs. Osborne incom-
parably greater than years of hard labour at the tub in a
prison-yard would be to the charwoman ; so that the talk
of even-handed justice in giving the same period of im-
prisonment to each is simply nonsense. We would not
wallop a rhinoceros and a high-spirited horse with the
same stick even for the same offending ; and to give to a
gentle and sensitive lad the same thrashing that we would
delight in giving to a hoodlum would n6t be even-handed
justice. Mrs. Osborne deserved to suffer, and she has
suffered. But the feeling that rejoices in the exaction of
the full measure of her penalty is not a just one, but a
dishonourable pandering to prevalent sentiments that are
falsely supposed to be democratic.
It is difficult to imagine anything' more
utterly callous in its dull, hog-like bruta-
lity than the Herald when it gets into
one of its humane moods. In the present
instance, it starts out cheerfully with the as-
sumption that a thief and utterly brazen per-
juress, who has the command of money and
moves in “society,” must necessarily bo a
“ refined and sensitive gentlewoman ” ; while a
charwoman, though she might be scrupulously
honest and truthful, is necessarily coarse, un-
feeling, brutal, hardened, and altogether an
eminently suitable person to do “ years of hard
labour at a tub in a prison-yard ” should the
law once get hold of her. The thieving and the
perjury and the other efforts which the prisoner
made to prove that she was neither refined
nor sensitive, make no difference ; she
belongs to “society,” therefore she must
be full of delicate feelings, even though
she doesn’t know it. 1)e Cobain, who
is lying low on the Continent to escape
trial for an altogether unprintable offence, also
belongs to society ; so do the Clcvcland-street
gang, and many more, and the same logic
applies to them in equal measure. The
Herald’s theory, iu short, is that every person
who has money and position is sensitive and
refined, and every person who has no money
is low and coarse and debased. If Mrs.
Osborne were to be swindled out of her pro-
perty, then she might become a charwoman
from necessity, and having become one the
Herald would promptly demand that she
should expiate her offence by putting in
five years at the wash-tub. The simile
of the race - horse and the rhinoceros is
good in its way, but the theory that the race-
horse is invariably the animal with money and
the rhinoceros the animal that is stone-broke is
evidence that the paper is one part pimp and one
part groveller. The Herald and similar prints
always demand that the rich offender should be
gently reproved and set at liberty, on the
ground that he or she is so utterly broken up
by remorse that further punishment would bo


nperfluous, and that the poor offender should
be flogged or hanged or sent to hard labour for
r long period because ho is impervious to
remorse, and can only be reached through the
medium of his hide. This is the assumption
the effects of which make the Hogging system
so hateful to any intelligent democrat. The
Bulletin has often remarked that you always
cee a fustian, and never a broadcloth coat,
beside the triangles in the gaol-yard.

Depression Drivel.
j v Victoria just at present the voices of blatant
politicians may be heard expounding to the
ignorant an unwholesome mixture of excuses
for “ prevailing depression,” and prescribing a
number of insane lotions for putting the country
on its legs. Tory candidates attribute the
scarcity of cash to the “strike,” whilst Radi-
cals more or less sincere, are tolerably unani-
mous in declaring that the “ boom ” was the
root of all evil. Members for remote rural dis-
tricts are safe in denouncing the Trades Hall,
the abolition of which infamous conspiracy,
followed by the Government grant of a new
bridge across the local streamlet, would restore
prosperity to the afflicted province. City and
suburban candidates, on the other hand, are
unduly anxious for a new railway policy, inas-
much as the future of the country is supposed
to be wrapped up in an immediate necessity
for making the railways pay (loud cheering).
Fresh taxation and a reduction in Civil Service
salaries are other favourite devices for pro-
moting the general welfare and dispelling the
cloud that hangs over everybody, but the desire
for these benefits seems to be governed by
purely personal considerations. The Radical
with a large family in small Government billets
generally believes in treating the Civil Servants
fairly, and the totally abstaining Tory recom-
mends the instant repeal of land taxation at
the expense of beer. But on two great points
the whole political mob seems to be agreed.
National prosperity is the inevitable out-
come of “sound legislation,” and a country
with a “ surplus ” must surely thrive.
Three hundred aspirants for election have
decided that “surplus” spells salvation. A
satisfactory Budget is the only guarantee of a
bounteous harvest, a splendid gold crop, a
rapid growth of manufactures, and a general
revival in trade. The bloated middlemen of
Flinders-lane, and the great “ representative ”
non-producers of Collins-street, take up the
parable and gravely protest that the first duty
of the Government is to revive trade. Mel-
bourne at large is keeping its eye on the Trea-
surer, in the vague expectation that he will
pull things through. Meanwhile, the local
press has discovered that hard times will come
again no more, now that the associated banks
have tightened the brazen bonds that bound
them together. “We can confidently hope,”
crows the Standard’s boss boy leader-writer,
“ that the long period of disaster, depression,
and distrust which has existed in financial
circles ended with the conclusion of the
bankers’ meeting on Saturday,” Thank heaven
the bankers’ have decided to save Victoria !
Let us hope they will be able to save them-
selves—and their depositors.

The New South Wales bogus “National”
“ vote for Thrift” Association should be called
the “ Have ” Association. It is the Association
which is arrayed in battle-order against the
“have-nots.” It masquerades as a working-
man’s benefit society, but is a scheme of the
monopolists to barricade their interests against
the rising tide of democracy. It seeks the
assistance of all who have money or rank to
lose; to those whose sole capital is brain and
muscle, it offers nothing. It promises to insure
people in the enjoyment of their savings. Just
think of the immense savings of a married
workman, whose average pay is, say, 325.
weekly, wet and fine, throughout the year, and
the exhaustion of the whole of whose income
often barely suffices for the satisfaction of bare
physical wants! Personal freedom, too, it
offers. Freedom of contract—freedom to the
unassociated labourer to die of hunger or accept
whatever conditions are imposed on him;
freedom to be employed at the lowest rate for
the longest hours. It bids for the support of
the small lot-holder and the avaricious work-
man who practices parsimony, and who, when he
gets three figures in the savings-bank imagines
himself equally menaced with the plutocrat.
I he general council of the National Association
consists of squatters, bankers, ship-owners,
landed proprietors—potentates of every hue.
Read their names, enquire about them, and
you will politically understand them.
Melbourne Daily Telegraph has acted
sensibly in reducing its size to four pages
instead of its former twaddling eight. The
present is a good time to start bright, well-
condensed four-page papers, and run rings round
the difluse gossip-rags that have no higher
object in life than to typify waste breath. Aus-
tralian daily papers have of late years run sadly
to seed. They fill up space with as little dis-
cretion as a corporation driver fills up a quarry-
hole with tipoart-refuse. Columns are devoted
to the vacant chatter of nobodies, and a meet-
ing of parish jackdaws is reported at as great a
length us would need to be devoted to a special
synod of archangels called to discuss the proro-
gation of tiie universe. The reason for this
pitiable flattening-out of reports is that daily
newspapers nowadays are chiefly written by
prosy maunderers who should be grocers’-clerks,
instead of by brainy men who can grip the ideas
” their subjects and condense the same into
|nthy crystals. The biggest of the dailies could
Je advantageously condensed into half their
news space. Life is too short to wade through
square miles of shallows. The motto of most
Rallies seems to be to hire cheap inexperience
that knows nothing of the value of space, that
measures its return for wages by the yard and
not by the quality, and that is enthusiastic
discretion, and proud of its laborious
ignorance.
R«v. J. G. Baton puts his anti-Kanaka appoa*
oi’cibly in places. He points out that, because
be Queensland law had declared that Poly-
nesian labour-recruiting for the Northern pro-
vince must cease by the end of ’9O, “ all the
labour vessels which could sail with licenses
before the last day of 1890 kept returning with
their loads of recruits till far into 1891.” The
planters had put on additional vessels for that
year and for years before, thus getting an extra
supply, and they bound down all comers to
serve for three years.—
Then, seeing that it is only about seven or eight months
since the planters ceased to get additional labour, and
seeing that very many of these Polynesians are now
working on the plantations, closing the traffic cannot
account for the decline of the sugar industry in Queens-
land. It has been declining for many years.
Dr. Raton shows that although the young and
healthy among the islanders were recruited,
“ the mortality amongst them has been very
great, the largest per cent, in the world, by
which many thousands of them have been laid
in their graves in Queensland, buried like dogs,
and others brought so to labour, suffer, and die
by the planters’ greed of gain.” Touching
which greed, he discourses :
On the sugar-plantations by law they are paid fourpence
per day, if they live to get it, for doing work for which
they would have to pay white men from ss. to Bs. per day.
Yet the planters and the Griffilwraithians are
always howling that white men won’t consent
to do the work of the planters. For fourpence
a day ! Let the whole land perish first, and
not alone the sugar industry. Then—
Before me and a number of gentlemen, a planter put
the following questions to a company of his men : “ Are
you happy?” “Do you like plantation work?” “Do
you gtt plenty of food?” “ Would you like to go back
to your islands? ” They replied yes or no, to his delight,
when he said, “ You see how happy they are,” &c. Soon
after I asked them the same questions in their own lan-
guage, when their answers were the reverse of what they
had before given, and they implored me to get them taken
home to Tanna. The traffic is a system of deception and
cruel oppression all through to the islanders.
The insolvency of E. S. Smithurst, tbe
Mudgee newspaper proprietor, who burst up
because the New South Wales Equity Court
granted him three injunctions and a warrant
and wasn’t able to enforce any one of them,
suggests two questions for the Government,
First : Will the State reimburse Mr.
Smithurst’s losses, seeing that it taxes that
gentleman to support the law-courts of New
South Wales under the pretext that these
courts will protect him against injustice—
which they failed to do, and also seeing that
the Court charged Mr. Smithurst a consider-
able amount in fees, &c., and then having taken
his money, it sold him a valueless injunction,
which was just as cheerful for him as though it
had taken his money and then given him a
valueless cheque? Second : Will Attorney-
General Barton devise some new kind of
injunction for future use, which will be a little
more effective than the old one, which latter
document seems only to ruin the plaintiff, while
the defendant drops the Court’s order into the
gutter and jumps on it ?

The Central Division (N.S.W.) squatters want
a 15-years’ extension of their leases in order to
enable them to destroy the rabbits within their
holdings ; besides requiring the Government to
find a £25,000 reward as before, to supply
50,000 tons of wire-netting for jd. an acre
extra rental, and to introduce nominal railway
freights for its carriage. After which, the
rabbits will increase and multiply while the
squatters finance on their improved security,
and await a favourable conjunction of political
parties who will permit freeholds to be
acquired, or will extend leases for another term
of 15 years. Should the Dibbs Government
assent to the proposed wholesale locking-up in
the hands of pastoralists of these valuable
leases, it is safe to say that it will never get a
democratic majority to endorse its action. At
the very least, one-half of the areas should be
made available next year, when the leases
expire, for settlement by small holders. Small
holdings are the solution of the rabbit-question.
The Melbourne Argus, in its last leader on the
One-man-one-vote principle, thuds down what
it evidently regards as an absolutely unanswer-
able crusher, and goes away leaving the demo-
cratic party flattened out. Under this principle,
it says, the English would be driven from India,
for, then, every Hindoo would have a vote, and
he would promptly vote the British race out of
their job as the rulers of the land. Therefore,
the One-man-one-vote idea is altogether wrong,
foolish and impracticable, and the article winds
up with another impassioned declaration that
an extra vote for Property is the correct
thing, and that Thrift ought to be en-
couraged. And it never once occurs to the mole
who writes this screed that the property-vote
system would extinguish the English rule in
India quite as fast as any other; in one case
every Asiatic and every white man would have
one vote, and the Asiatic would wipe the white
man out; in the other the rich white man
would have an extra vote or fifteen extra votes
for Thrift, and the rich Asiatic Would have the
same, and the Asiatic would wipe the English-
man out again. Consequently, if this illustra-
tion proves that manhood suffrage is wrong, it
also proves that the property suffrage is
supremely idiotic. This point, of course,
only proves the Argus’s utter want of reasoning
capacity, for even supposing the property vote
system would enable the English to hold India
and the other system would not, it makes not
the slightest difference to anybody in this
country. It is quite as interesting and quite as
much to the point to mention that under the
One-man-one-vote policy the Eskimo would pro-
bably be unable to hold Greenland—which is
perfectly true, seeing that the elector in that
country would probably be frozen or eaten by a
bear on his way to the poll. To tell the truth,
Australia doesn’t care one solitary copper
whether England holds India or not, or whether
India holds England, or whether they both hold
Mexico. The matter isn’t of the slightest
interest to anybody. United Australia is going
to be a Republic, and One-man-one-vote will be
the electoral basis of that Republic. Let
nobody forget this.
The Messageries Maritimes liner P<>ly-
nesien has beaten all records by travelling from
Sydney to Marseilles in under 2(> days’ actual

that the other new French liners are equally

can build ships.
The Unemployed of Sydney.
The night of Ist April, 1892, was a notable
one to the Sydney unemployed : it was the last
on which they occupied the livery-stables wherein
they had found temporary shelter, and it was the
night on which each man for the first time re-
ceived the loan of a Government blanket. At
9.30 only five men were in the big yard—two were
cutting up bread, two preparing the soup. The
two-pound loaf was cut into six cubes ; one of
these, with a half-pint of soup, formed a man’s
supper. The chief cook was a member of the
Soudan Contingent, and he entertained the press-
men with reminiscences, lie stirred the copper
with a pole; two wash-tubs of soup were beside
him.
The men were expected from the meeting at
the Exhibition Building about 10.30. ; mean-
while, the policeman, candle in hand, showed the
visitors over the stables. Several “beds” were
“ planted ” in holes and corners, a bed being a
copy or two of a daily paper. Seven bales of
blankets stood in a loft awaiting the superin-
tendent’s order for unpacking. Five or six men
unable to attend the meeting had already had
their supper and had taken up their couches for the
night. Here upon a bench a coal-lumper was
lying awake. He had no coat. The day’s work
had been his first for six weeks, and after his 12
hours of toil ho had dined on five ounces of bread
and half a pint of soup. In the morning he would
get the same amount of bread, three or four
ounces of cheese, and a cup of “Jersey tea.” To-
morrow would be Saturday-pay-day ; he could
look forward to a coat and a bed.

One very old man, clad in a ragged shirt
and trousers, was stretched, motionless, upon the
wet stones in one of the horse-stalls. Ills boots
served as a pillow ; his bare feet were scored with
sores and blisters. He was racked by a horrid
cough—the presage of speedy dissolution. A
broad, raised platform ran half-way round the
big yard, but he was too weak to climb upstairs.
He was 72 years old ; he had been sleeping in the
Domain for weeks past, and that “had done for
him.” He was spitting ominously bright blood.
“ We’ll have to take you to the hospital,” said the
policeman, lifting him and bearing him up the
steps. Now he is dead. In a manger a dwarf, a
mere skeleton, seemed to sleep the sleep of death.
He was paralysed on one side, yet his naked arm.
all shrivelled and twisted, looked a perfect mem-
ber of bis wasted body.
» « 3
At one end of the platform a young man
of 22 lay upon bis stomach. “He had been to the
hospital that day; the doctors had removed
eleven boils from his back. The wounds had been
washed and anointed and ‘fixed up ’ with plaster ;
the hospital authorities couldn’t give him indoor
relief.” He had no vest. His back, which might
be that of Job, was half-covered with blood-stained
sticking-plaster. He had only one relative in Syd-
ney—a sister, who was employed as a servant. She
would get her wages on Saturday night; then she
would buy him a shirt. If he would let her, the
good girl would give him every “ bean ” she had.
* # #
“ There is a lot of destitution in Sydney,”
remarked the policeman. “ Whole families sleep
upon the Domain. One woman (a widow) with
two children, used to earn her bread by charing
during the day, and sleep with her youngsters
under the rocks at Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair. One
morning, at two o’clock, a child was born upon
the Domain ; there was nothing to wrap it in, for
a dress was all the clothing the mother had.”

Soon the torchmen of the procession re-
turned from the Exhibition building, with the
tidings that blankets would be served out that
night. The soup-vessels—four basins, six cups,
twenty half-pint pots—were ranged upon a little
table. Accordingly, the men on their return
would be let through the gate in detachments of
thirty. When a detachment had finished its
supper, it would go straight away to bed and give
place to a second batch.
• « #
The basins held a pint each and the
nearest men unselfishly took the half-pints or
handed a basin to an old man. In one such case
the receiver said “ you’re a gentleman.” “ Wish
to God I was,” replied the helper.
The cook kept saying, “Help yourselves, men ;
Heaven only helps those that help themselves.”
The soup threatened not to hold out, and one
committee-man, evidently brought up in the milk
industry, suggested adding a bucket of water to
it. Luckily there was enough.
One man, who took no soup, stood apart look-
ing helpless and confused ; when spoken to he
placed his hand upon his mouth and shook
his head. lie was deaf and dumb. “I
am hungry, very,” he . signalled, “ when
will it be my turn?” He was a tailor;
he had had no work for nine weeks. “ I want
work,” he said, “ I am a man—proud—much—so,”
giving one to understand that he wished for no
offer of money. “Would he have a smoke?”
“ Yes.” It was his first pipe for a fortnight.
Another thing he wished for—a quiet place in the
stables to lie down : people did not understand
the deaf-and-dumb.
By 12 o’clock nearly everybody had gone to
rest. Five hundred and fifty men! were huddled
together in every conceivable posture. A half-
dozen were awake, a few just half asleep, moving
restlessly, or rolling from side to side, but the
great majority were looked in the first deep
slumber. A phenomenon was a somnambulist,
unconscious, standing erect in his tattered shirt.
One man, and one only, was drunk. As a punish-
ment he had received no blanket. “ Why had he
spent his money in drink ? ” “I had no money to
spend ; I met a couple of mates ; they shouted,
and two glasses knocks a man over when he’s
weak and hungry.” Only one man begged : he
wanted a pair of trousers.
* • #
The secretary stated that up to date no
scheme for relief work had been propounded. The
committee had been solely occupied in relieving
distress. Four committeemen were engaged in
soliciting subscriptions ; four, provisions ; the two
others and he, the secretary, formed the working-
committee. Ninety-five out of a hundred seemed
well-framed and able-bodied. Almost every pro-
fession and trade was represented ; a great many
were very respectable members of the artisan class;
one third of the total were powerful and earnest
labourers. There were a few coloured men ; not
one Chinaman. Next day they would take up
their quarters in the old Exhibition Building;
there they would be comfortable.
* # #
What became of the female unemployed ?
The secretary had really not thought of that.
Mortgaging Corpses.
A London compositor has just finished a
term of six weeks’ imprisonment, for a baccha-
nalian fraud, lie rushed into his boss’s sanctum
with a woeful visage, and sobbingly stated that
his beloved wife was dead. ilis employer gavu
him =65 wherewith to bury her. He disappeared,
bnt, in an hour or so, returned, more dishevelled
than ever. “My just-born baby’s dead— hoohoo!
—lollered its pore dear ma— uhoo ! —two angels in
heaven— ivahj” The boss advanced him some
wages. The “chapel” of compositors subscribed
for coffin-wreaths. Then he wandered forth sadly
and limply—until round the corner. The funerals
did not happen in due time, and when the wifo
turned up to enquire after her worthy husband, ho
was fairly on the road to gaol.

Which reminds : There were two bright
spirits connected with a certain Australian weekly
paper—Greely and Day. They paired on one
occasion in a tremendous “bender,” and a day or
two found them both “ broke ” and ready to pawn
their eternal prospects for a pick-me-up. They
consulted deeply and desperately, and they hit
upon a plan, unique and melodramatic. They
rehearsed it firstly in chambers. Then they
pawned a vest for sixpence, went and had a
corpse-reviver apiece, and rehearsed the melo-
drama once more in a pub. parlour, “to make
sure.” Sallied forth Greeley, to the office. He
entered the boss’s den without knocking, with
eyes staring affrightedly out of his head, features
twisted with anguish and body spasmodically
twitching. Placing his right hand upon his fore-
head, while his left shaken and imploringly
in the air, he gasped out with a painful heave:
“My God ! Poo-oor Day !” “ What's he
been doing now, Mr. Greely ?” said the startled
boss. A sigh that seemed to come from a slit
bellows, and then—“ Ah ! he’ll never do anything
any more. He’s dead!" 1 “What?” With a
fearful groan-—“ Dead ! lie came to my apart-
ment this morning, and was talking to me as
cheerfully as ever, when, all of a sudden, he gave
a shudder, and fell down on to my sofa, a corpse !
Imagine the shock to me ! See how my limbs
are quivering !1 ” (So they were, for Greely
had the “jerks” badly.) “Well, what do
you want me to do for you, Mr. Greely ? ” said
the boss, kindly. Greely burst into a passionate
fit of hysterical weeping. “Do for me? (Sol.)
Why, I haven’t a penny in the house. (Tears.)
There’s the police to be informed (lamentation)-,
there’ll have to bean inquest. (A flood of b'ubbery.)
Fancy them cutting up poor old Day ! (Hmvls.)
And I must go and break the news to his poor
wife ! ” (Collapses doicn utterly in a paroxysm
of grief.) “Well,” asked the boss, emotion
half-choking his utterance, “ how much do you
want?” Weepingly: “I must have <£s.” “Here,
then”—writing out a paper—“take this order to
the cashier.” Greely vacated the room, and made
for the cashier. Then he vanished to meet Day.
- . . Meanwhile, Day had been waiting in the
pub. parlour. The one rum had started work in
Ids already demoralised brain. He wanted a
second “straightener” worse than he had wanted
the first. His mind wandered. The minutes
seemed hours to his galloping consciousness.
He lost his ideas. Suddenly, he began
to remember—“Ah! yes; hadn’t he and
Greely made up a plot by which the wind was to
be raised? Of course they had ! What a fool he
was not to have remembered it! lie was to go to
the office and report that Greely was dead. He
recollected it all clearly now. And Greely was
waiting round the corner for him. He would go
at once.” .... The boss was hard at work,
but every now and then paused to mutter : “ Poor
Day! we’ve lost a brilliant man.” The door
opened suddenly. Day entered with a tortured
expression, placed his right hand upon his fore-
head, semaphored his left arm melodramatically,
and hoarsely gurgled :“ My God ! Poor Greely !
He’s dead! He came to my room this morning
and was talk—.” With a bound the boss was out
of his chair. Day flew off at a sudden tangent out
through the door, clean down the front steps into
the street, bewildered, hatless, and thirsting for
Greely’s blood The pair met again
within the next ten minutes; explanations that at
one time were murderously threatening ended in
a fair dividend and a merry carouse.

Manager Henry Gyles Turner’s reassuring
circular has put up in price the shares of the Mel-
bourne Bank. There has always been a prejudice
against Manager Turner for his literary proclivi-
ties. Not very long ago he even shocked his
brother bankers by acting Symperson, in Gilbert’s
“Engaged,” at Prahran Town Hall, with distin-
guished amateurs the sort that shine more
on overdrafts than balances. Various defunct
unlucky magazines have wanted to get him as
banker, but he has drawn the line—a little deaf in
that ear. He is prominent at the Unitarian
Church, where his sister Martha, afterwards Mrs.
Webster, was clergywoman.
Three fearless young bank-clerks once
sallied into the Victorian bush bent on capturing
alive or dead the bushranger Power. They were
looking for a roughly-attired man riding on a roan
horse. They met a well dressed civilian mounted
on a dark-bay thoroughbred. Salutations were
exchanged, and, primed with the importance of
there hazardous quest, the bank-clerks talked
about how they were going to divide the Govern-
ment reward between them so soon as they had
netted Power. The civilian turned back a stretch
of the road witli them and wished them luck.
Suddenly as he gained the “ drop” on them, ho
thundered out—“ Bail up, you donkeys; throw
up your arms. I’m Power!” They “bailed.”
Then Power made them one by one strip to their
bare pelts, unsaddle and unbridle their horses,
and burn all their duds and harness. Stampeding
the horses before him, lie bade the naked three
good morning, with some kindly advice as to how
they could mention at the township the her
manner in which they “ caught Power.”

BJC Macquarie-street North, Sydney, April C, 1892.
My Dear Moorabinua, —
The first Sydney' seance of the Australian Home Read-
ing Union, at the Town Hall, the other Monday, loomed
with undeserved importance on the dismal social horizon
of a wet Lenten week, simply because Lady Jersey was
goin’ to fill the chair, and her luvin’ subjects wanted to
see if she had altered much since the remote date on
which they' last saw her. And she was there in a pretty
cosmea-pink silk gown with a darker stripe; the bodice
folded over frontally'; bonnet of ecru lace and pink bows
and strings. She was almost the only' bright spot in a long
wash of frights that surged from the floor to the platform
where sat Lady- Windeyer, Miss Macdonald (the brand-new
lady'-principal of the Ladies’ College, who is revealed to be
a tall savant with non-committal hair and a long pale
face, enhanced on this occasion by a black frock and
hat); Mrs. Wblstenholme; a well-known Judge, who
occasionally inserted his fourth finger in his
mouth; Mr. Goschen in an eye-glass, and several
professors. The crowd was largely' female (though
I had an edifying view of a fortunate young man squeezed
in between two girls who each shared the rim of her chair
with him) and mostly ill-dressed, with one or two excep-
tions. A pretty brunette, in a well-cut black gown, had
a very jaunty hat with bows of red-and-black striped
ribbon ; and somebody else was festive in a scarlet Tudor
cloak softened with black braid—but the rest was rag-bag.
One Australian Home Reader of the gentler sex had her
soiled yellow flounces visibly pinned on here and there ;
and gazing round with the eye of a grandmother at the
swarm of untidy people, one could not help thinking they
wouldn’t find much time for organised reading if they
gave their personal appearance a chance. If the she-mem-
bers of the A.H.R.U. think to justify themselves in the eyes
of the marriageable man by talking his largely-ignorant
head off about all the deep and boring literature they can
lay their hands on, I must rise hastily to submit that the
haggard spinster who discourses lovely Ruskin in undarned
stockings and lank hair is the sort of thing no normal
male exactly yearns to metamorphose into a “ missus.”
As to theobjects(Lady J. pronounces it “objiks”)of the
A.H.R. Union, briefly put, the whole thing seems to be a
deep-laid scheme to heighten the already deplorable
gregariousness of humanity by emphasising what a
beautiful thing it is to read a book and know that thou-
sands of people are reading it at the same time. Certain
courses of study are announced per pamphlet, by the
committee, and the Union has to plough through them or
resign. “ How lovely,” said one speaker in effect, “to
have one’s family all reading the same book ! ” Especially
lovely, I yearned to chip in, when you have just arrived
at the crisis and rush to see how it all ends and find that
somebody else has got the volume. The Union is to have
its moments of relaxation, which are to take the form of
lectures and magic-lanterns without trimmings, and
although there doesn’t appear to be much mental holiday
about a scientific lantern-slide, yet it is quite frivolous
compared to the organised list of brain-worry, which
includes weird and awful tirades on the “Principles of
State Interference,” “ Economics of Industry,” and other
gay and festive tomes calculated to furrow your baby brow
inches deep in a fortnight. But the Union’s courses of
improving literature lean, largely, it is almost unnecessary
to say, towards the side of the Strictly Orthodox.
Can anybody explain the blind passion for slop etceteras
that characterises the Australian woman ? Slop gloves,
slop corsets, slop boots are worn by everybody—from poor
Mary Ann to the woman whom, for want of a better word,
you and I and all of us call “ smart.” And it isn’t because
they have not had chances. An enterprising capitalist
tried to start a kid-glove factory, where gloves could be
made to order, in Sydney once—but where is that factory
now? Melbourne’s best corsetibre not so long ago filed
her schedule, and bowed down to ready-made ; and for
one boot-shop where a genuine follower of St. Crispin
takes -he longitude of your little foot with a measure that
tickles dreadfully, there are a thousand ready-made shoe-
shops, with hoof-cases built to the model of the feet of the
women of the country that exports them. The result is
that the Australian woman suits her waist, feet and hands
to the requirements of somebody else, and loses a lot of
individuality in consequence. Notice the gloved-hand of
any otherwise well-dressed woman. If all the clasps are
hitched, it’s ten to one the fingers hang in little points off
the tips, and if the fingers fit neatly at the top, then they
aren’t divided as deeply as the fingers inside, but join just
below the second joint, thus bringing about the webbed
expression of a duck’s foot. It’s safe to bet that the top
button isn’t fastened when you see a glove like that, and
an unfastened glove spoils the true inwardness of your
get-up, as much as if you hung your bonnet tipsily over
your left ear.
But it’s when she comes to her feet that the indigenous
she (who ought to be particular considering the ineffec-
tive shingles a wise Providence has generally poised her
on) doesn’t know how to look after herself. No wonder
the mincing or sprawling gait of our darlings is a bye-
word among the nations, for all their boots are “slops,”
which the foot is made to fit, and the result is that either
the wearer can’t walk without the moral support of a
gamp, or else her boots wiggle-waggle about on her pedal
extremities as if she were walking on perpetual orange-
peel. And the Australee she goes wrong- even in the
pattern of her bocts, for she generally chooses button-ups
which go pulpy and spread-eagle into a sort of burlesque
of her foot, instead of choosing lace-ups, which keep the
ankles neat from first to last. If, after this little lecture,
you say “Pshaw! our women go properly shod,” just
notice the earthward end of ladies who flip in and out of
carriages with worn-over heels and missing buttons-or
revel in the fall-abroad looking tootsie-wootsies of the
girl who raises her swaying draperies to jump the gutter.
Harping- on the pavement-stampers of my poor, dear
sex, I want to complain of the way in which evening-
shoes are worn about the street. Low-cut dancing-shoes
are unhealthy for out-door wear—they are expensive,
because they are not constructed for uneven surfaces
and, above all, they always look hopelessly vulgar. Yet,
half the girls you fall foul of on the block totter along in
these wooden-heeled, stained-paper abominations, because
they have shallow toes and make the foot look small at
half peep. On the mountain mail-train, the other night,
I saw an obvious bride launch forth on her honeymoon
in a pair of red morocco evening-shoes with brilliant
buckles ! 1 pity the bridegroom when the chilblain season
dawns.
I hear that two or three English “Johnnies” at
Government House, Perth, recently imitated the now
notoriousfrolicsof some well-advertised society girls; they
aimed jellies across the festive board at one another, and
volleyed with tumblers of fizz until the Administration
grew tired of the crash of broken glass and packed the
hilarious bevy off the premises. They have, however,
since been guests at the haunt of the Queen’s representa-
tive.
I want to scold the audience at Sydney Garrick for the
way they applauded Lisa’s first solo on the revival of
“ rjonnambula,” last Saturday. It was, to my mind,
simply hideous—out of tune, wheezing, ear-piercing, yet
when she finished the round of dreary applause struck
up allee same. It may be only courteously done, but
when people shriek rapturously at a vocal failure it makes
genuine applause absolutely meaningless and gives the
singers a fine contempt for the musical discernment in
front. But (he Cutticas were in good voice and sang with
much expression—indeed I have never heard Mr. C. so
vocally wrought up—he seemed to make Elvino’s bothers
his own from curtain-rise. But I must take exception to
his invariable habit—when overcome with stage
grief—of striding to the wings, hugging his head
with his hands and quivering all over like
water jelly-. And-to continue cantankerously-
La Cuttica’s Amina, though vocally bird-like, was one
and the same girl as Gild a, Violet Yatery, Lucia, and so
on, even to the hair, and one can’t help longing for the
lady to borrow the golden wig of the handiest chorus-girl
so as to remove the impression, rapidly gaining ground,
that the operatic Nemesis makes a dead-set at brunettes.
From Cuttica’s clothing in “ Sonnambula” the girl who
wears chemisettes (I mean outwardly) can gain many
hints how to make them look different every time. And
apropos of clothes, it is easy to know just when the
operatic heroine’s lady friends begin to cut her—you can
tell it by her skirt. As the gushing innocent of the
village, it’s touch-and-go betw-een the final flounce and
her knees, but when the inevitable cloud arises, down
comes her petticoat to her ankles in one rush. They do
say sorrow improves people.
One wails “ lohahod ” over Sydney “ Women’s Fund,”
which was such a healthy, bounding institution in Lady
Carington’s time, what with mobbed meetings and the
dailies individualizing the more or less representative
bonnets on the platform, and suburban outsiders running
all over the town for subscriptions, that they might rise
proudly before her ladyship and deposit the shining
shekels at her feet. They wisely called it the “ Women’s
Fund,” in those glad days, and the democratic florin spun
alongside the loyal eighteenpence, and the secretary had
to draw breath twice in announcing the total. But, at
the last meeting of the now-called “Queen’s Jubilee
Fund,” with Lady J. on the poop, a yearly increase of
£7 ss. was timidly revealed to a small and depressed
assembly, which sat in unadvertised gloom and silence.
Which once again makes it apparent that women do
nothing for nothing. The “objecks” of the Fund are
the same as ever—but where are the women who bailed
you up on the Block for charity-subscriptions? You find
the answer in the fact that “live” titled personal
patronage failed the League when Lady Carington went
away.
We may drink too much tea in Australia, but you don’t
utterly condemn the person who is tempted beyond her
strength, do you? I had some tea (Golden Tip Ceylon
Pekoe) sent me recently by Murrell Brothers, 509 George-
street, Sydney, who bought it at auction from Frazer &
Co., and its auction price was £2 17s. per lb.! But the
true tea-worshipper would give twice as much without a
murmur after the first sip. It is like the nectar an angel
might offer you at a Heavenly five o’clocquer.
When lovely woman stoops to writing milk-sop litera
ture for the young, she can hardly be expected to send a
thrill through the grown-up inner consciousness, and so I
approached Mrs. W. Campbell Browne’s little Easter story,
“ The Three Sisters,” with what I should imagine to be
the feeling of an alderman confronted with a mere bun.
It shows very “proper” feeling on the part of Mrs. H-
to sell the famous Hargreaves pearls at auction when they
fetched £lOl6, for (leaving out the fact that their sensa-
tional history was calculated to boom their price) no sen-
sitive woman could wear them with an ex-friend “ doing
time ” in gaol on account of their attractions. By the
way, pearls come next to opals as unlucky gems, and it
would be interesting to see if the Hargreaves’ set of
oysters’ tears bring any misfortune to their new owners,
who must be devoid of all superstition. Pearls just fished
up are looked upon askance by, lots of properly supersti-
tious folks, many of whom wouldn’t take the H. article as
a gift after they had so proved the balefulness of their
influence.
Talking of pearls reminds me of a woman I supped near
to once at a charity ball. She was eating an oyster patO
most deliberately, giving each mouthful more than the
regulation 32 chews, and her cavalier remonstrated that
everything else would be gone before she had finished.
“I alius chew hyster-pattys close,” said she, “for you.
never know but what there’s a pearl in ’em !”
The theatrical libel-case of the moment in Sydney
showed up the bounding opera-troupe lady in a new light
—for the seraph who foots the bill for her own outings-
can’t be such a mercenary charmer as people would fain-
have us think. It transpired that when the ladies of a
certain American burlesque Co. swept forth on horseback,
each of them had the bill for the hire of her prancing
steed deducted from her salary, and each lady paid her
own hoofing as it were. The attendant cavaliers must-
have shone with a very subdued radiance in the eye of the
livery-man. Next time I meet a golden-haired artiste-
perched gingerly on the top of a hired horse, I will regard l
her with the rapt expression that in these bad times is:
certainly due to the person who is recklessly dissipating
twelve-and-sixpence.
Judged in the lurid light of that newspaper libel-case
it would seem that the editorial hubby has sometimes to-
choose between domestic reprisals and the Supreme-
Court. And then comes a monkey damages and all costs.
It must be an awful responsibility to be connected by
marriage with a newspaper !
There was a pied d.c. at “ Sonnambnla.” Lord Bertie’s l
pa-in-law brought two of his daughters—the elder in a
black gown and white wrap, the younger in pin's veiling
and chiffon, trimmed with ruby velvet ribbon. In a box
Fanny Liddiard shone with a subdued radiance in a black
gown, touched up with old gold. Carrie Swain, in the-
circle, wore pink silk, combined with rainbow brocade,
gold galon and pink chiffon ; Mrs. James Marks in black
and net, worked with gold thread ; Miss Lily Marks, white
silk and gold galon, with an artistic touch of coxcomb-
crimson frontally. And 1 found the counteracting sarto-
rial olives in a lady in mauve and white, combined like a
paper pattern, and a blonde lady in a wreath of roses and
a deadly green gown, as if she had steeped herself in
verdigris.
1 have just learnt that one branch of usefulness prac-
tised by Sydney Y.M.C.A. is to ferret out the stray sheep
whose English parents want to know their whereabouts,
and, when found, to broom the tobacco-ash from their
uncut locks and shake the corks and pawn-tickets out of
their pockets and pack them off home in repentant mood
with their hair neatly parted in the middle. But really
lost-relative finding and forwarding is an ungrateful
industry, because it’s ten to one the family’s anxious
enquiries are only dictated by conscience, and that the
last thing in the world they really want to see is the
prodigal dumping down his Australian blue blanket in
the ancestral hall. He was a gentlemanly-looking prodigal
when they kicked him out, and they always think of him
wandering ’neath a torrid zone with a clean shirt on
everyday, and scent on his handkerchief, so when he
turns up in moleskins that he has worn all the voyage,
and green-hide boots lied with string, he isn’t a bit like
the wanderer of his mother’s dreams (who never smelt of
stale tobacco) and his kith and kin are desperately sorry
they ever roused him out. And the Y.M.C.A. is often
mildly astonished at receiving no thanks for its prompt
delivery of the human consignment—it doesn’t enter into
the family’s murderous feeling towards their helpful
institute when it first became obvious that the restored

I want to know if you think it exactly clever of a very
fascinating girl to “do” the various dress-circles with
ma, of whom there is so much, and who waddles so duck-
fully? There always remains the fatal likeness, and you
can t help putting the avoirdupois, and all the rest of it,
on to the beautiful daughter, who carts ma round to
honestly warn her numerous adorers as to what the rose
will turn to by and by. Dear, dear me, it always recalls
in a topsy-turvy way the skull and crossbones legend:
“ As J’oa are, I once was ; as I am, so you will be.”
Yours affectionately,

A paragraph which crept into last issue
concerning the recent marriage of a Hebrew
gentleman of Sydney appears to have caused
much annoyance to those concerned —chiefly by
reason of an allegation to the effect that the
wedding had led to the severance of their connec-
tion with the local Hebrew congregation. As we
are assured that nothing is further from the fact
than this, we have to express regret that any
statement of the kind should have been permitted
to appear.
Directors of Wallaroo (S.A.) mines have
decided that the miners—already the worst-paid
in all Australia—shall in future work under the
open tender [i.c., freedora-of-contract, or “sweat-
ing ”) system.
If a Judge should not adjudicate where his
son appears as counsel, what should be the rule as
to the appearance of Judges’ sons-in-law and
nephews before their papas-in-law and uncles? If
the line is to be drawn at blood-relations, what
about club friendships, Masonic ties, and so on?
The discussion of this question is in full blast at
Brisbane, and the people being discussed are Chief
Justice Lilley and his son “Ned,” It is a terrible
thing to live in a limited community.
Victorian Premier Shiels (a Scotch college
boy) is very young-looking and apparently with-
out “side,” He wears a low-crowned hat and tweed
suit and travels on the tram dummy. As a
barrister he was never successful and as a youth
was thought rather visionary; winning the vice-
Chancellor’s essay-prize at Melbourne University
did him no great good. He first came into
prominence by his Divorce-Bill and his subsequent
trip to England.
The Earl of Huntingdon, whose engage-
ment with Sir Samuel Wilson’s daughter has just
been cabled, though the son of a bankrupt peer,
can claim the bluest of blue blood. He is the
third earl in point of precedence, ranking after
Shrewsbury and Derby. As Macaulay mentions
in his essay on Warren Hastings, the family has
experienced a strange romance. Robin Hood was
the alleged founder of the race. The earl is quite
a young man. His brother is called Warren
Hastings after the Indian nabob.
Old Ebenezer Skinner, bookseller, of
Sydney, is dead. lie fell sick, the other day, and
was told that his heart had given out and that he
bad to die ; for four days thereafter he lay await-
ing the arrival of the scythe-bearer, his one great
anxiety the while being that after he had gone
some clergyman might promulgate a specious
story that in his last hours he had renounced
agnosticism. It is understood that the old man
left some property and a most equitable will, and
that the securities deposited with him for safe-
keeping by the numerous persons who regarded
him as a model of integrity, are all in perfect
order.
Williams says that he “feels just like
this.” He wants to see Miss Rounsevell in the cell
before him and to ask her a question; ‘Miss
Rounsevell, are you engaged to be married to me ? ’
‘ If,’ he says, ‘she answers truly I shall then ask —
*As your affianced husband do you regard me
as guilty of this crime with which I am
charged, or do you regard me as an innocent man ?’
Upon her answer the happiness of my subsequent
life will depend.” And Miss Roun«evell—well,
she declines to see him, but if she did she would
just toss her little head and say: “Frederick,
dear-, whether you are guilty or not is not for me
but for a jury to say, but so far as I can make out
the wicked police and the unscrupulous newspapers
bave made out what seems a strong prima facie
case. There now ! ”
When Deeming was in Sydney he occupied
a, house in the vicinity of Petersham. There
was a large stretch of asphalt in front of the house,
and one day, for no visible reason, the incipient
Baron Swanston had the asphalt torn up and the
ground dug over and planted with small fruit
trees. Then one night the servant went out after
dark, and Deeming went out close behind her.
According to current reports, he. had an unaccount-
able aversion to this girl; anyhow, she never came
back and nobody ever saw or heard of her
again. A day or two later, Deeming tore
nip the fruit trees and turned the ground
into a lawn. The grass has flourished there
•ever since which possibly proves that the
ground is well suited for grass ; or, again, it may
be an evidence that dead servant-girl is a good
foundation to construct a lawn upon. Anyhow,
it might be as well to look under these grass-roots
and see if the lost slavey is there. Nobody digs a
lawn as a rule, and regarded as a place to deposit
a deceased friend in it is better than a hearthstone
by a very large percentage. This is The Bulle-
tin’s own special horror, and is probably as big a
lie as most of tiie other horrors, and the daily
papers are hereby warned not to publish portraits
■of that slavey or otln nvise interfere with the
•copyright.
SUNDRY SHOWS.

Garrick Italian Opera Company.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Opera House “Masks and Faces.”
Princess - Elton’s Last Nights.
Theatre Royal “ Bridget O’Brien.”

At Her Majesty's, in Sydney, they are
playing “Nowadays,” and it’ takes the public
fancy in various kinds of ways, though why it
bears the name it does no human soul can tell
for it might be designated “Gosh ” and get there
just as well. And it doesn’t matter that, in spots,
the drama’s weak and ill, for the joy is ever kept
alive by Rignold’s brother, Bilk The baronet in
the story is a fiend without remorse, and he gets
in awful trouble through embezzling a horse.
He’s an evil-minded noble with a bitter grin and
scowl, and all the seven devils that vociferously
do howl round Iscariot in Tophet to all eternity
are as mild as seven curates by comparison with
he. But the mills of God grind surely, and in the
present case that mill, is close upon his track
disguised as Rignold’s brother, Bilk And even
when he rises, with language full of ire, and
unjustly bids his son to start at once for endless
fire, and ejects him with a waddy and language
full of hate, and swears when he is struck upon
the stomach with a gate, and tells his friends in
general to go to and grill, still the crowd
gets broken-winded cheering Rignold’s brother,
Bilk The funny man is dreary and washy in the
head, and his jokes are horrible to hear and
mostly made of lead, and his mirth is like
the discords of a wild - eyed German band,
that bangs on brazen cymbals in a bleak
and barren land. And the race - horse, in
this paragraph already mentioned—the animal
by the noble aforesaid—is not a wild
and foaming steed that leaves the wind behind,
but just a solemn crow-bait somewhat vacant in
its mind. And the fair and gentle maiden who
gathers up her trunk—her father turns up later in
a haggard state and drunk—and flies by night in
secret—we have met her oft before, and (we say it
in a whisper) she begins to be a bore; for, long as
we have known her, we have never met her yet
when she didn’t get abducted by the wicked
baronet. But regardless of these evils the play
goes with a will, for a thing of joy and gladness is
Rignold’s brother Bilk The funny man may
perish—likewise the leading dude, and the baronet
may lose himself —he isn’t any good ; also the
bloodshot crowd that bursts a door up in its rage,
and jumps with both its feet upon two welshers
on the stage; and a harmless man who stops a
hole to keep the wind away, and a few assorted
parents who are not altogether gay, and a youth
who wants to die by reason of a big cigar, and
various other people, we can’t remember who
they are—from all of them, if need be, we will
tear ourselves away. And the only thing we ask
is, on the resurrection day, when gathering in the
blackened air with footsteps fast and fleet, the
ghosts that tread on nothing with their silent,
fleshless feet, in myriads are assembled on spectral
wings to rise—then we ask with all due reverence
that somewhere in the skies, amid the bowers of
asphodel or by the jasper sea, where the sun-
shine never fadeth to all eternity, or in that
golden city, which is set upon a hill, we may
come across *he hoofprints of Rignold’s brother
Bilk

“A Sailor’s Knot” will fade away out of
the Royal playbill this week to make room for
“ Master and Man.” Meanwhile in the last days
of the dying drama the British tar is getting up
sundry arrears of loose and disintegrated whoop-
ing over the glorious flag of Britain, which invari-
ably waves wherever it is hoisted, provided there
happens to be a breeze about. The stage-tar, of
the good old times, always does whoop in this
misguided style; as for the real one he would just
as soon have thought of walking head downwards
on the ceiling, and his chief anxiety was to pick
the worms out of the biscuits. Moreover he was
mostly a sad and silent man whose eyes were
strained with looking at that very small object,
his salary, by an exceedingly dim light, and he
filled in the rest of his time by sleeping in a
flooded bunk and being flogged. Therefore the
stage seaman is an outrage, and this paper regards
him with an unfriendly eye.

Throughout this week Sydney Criterion
has been filled with great masses of people all
bearing up manfully against a great and heart-
rending grief. It is the last week of Anson—
unless he is re-engaged with great difficulty for
exactly six nights more—and that ancient
favourite is reluctantly tearing himself away as
Eccles, in “Caste.” Our own private opinion is
that when Anson is about to play this character
he sleeps for six nights in the Domain, and joins
in the rush of unemployed at the soup-kitchen in
order to give tone and colouring to the picture.
Possibly, however, it is on account of the actor’s
emotion that Eccles seems, if possible, a little
more bleary this time than usual. Cn previous
occasions lie looked like a gentleman who had
been scooped up in a dredge and educated in a
mud-punt; this time he looks like a gentleman
who had been thrown out into a dog-kennel and
not educated at all. He is the most maudlin and
the most wildly-gifted drunk in all the range of
comedy, a moral, beery clown, full of noble senti-
ments and old boots and stale liquor and disinte-
grated whiskers. When lie is gone there will bo a
woeful gap on the Australian stage, for no such
joyous inebriate ever struck this country before.
Mrs. Brough, Miss Pattie Browne, and Brough
himself, as the gasfitter with the lofty soul, also
bring down the house regularly in the intervals
between Anson’s bursts of intoxication, and the
cast in general is above reproach.

The Italian Opera Company opened an
ascititious season at Sydney Garrick on Saturday
night with “La Sonnambuln,” Signora Cuttica
enacting Amina with felicitous concordance cf
voice and dramatic gesture; Signor Travaglini,
Count Rodolpho; Signorina Mattioli, Lisa;
Siguorina Casfiglioni, Theresa; George Johnston,
Alessio ; and H. Cassio, II Notaria. On Monday
night, “La Traviata” was staged, with the
Cuttica as Violetta ; on Wednesday, “ Martha ” ;
with “Rigoletto” and “ Lucia di Lammcrmoor ”
in prospect. On Thursday and Friday, of last
Week, the Garrick was held by Rice’s Evangeline
Company, who gave a farewell performance to
Sydneyites.

At Sydney Royal Standard, Monsieur
D’A re’s wonderful artificial performers deserve to


be a bigger draw than they have so far proved.
The mechanism of the fantoccini is perfect and
under marvellous control, the stage appointments
are picturesque and well-managed, and the whole
entertainment crackles with fun and burlesque
horrors. The feats of the magnetic skeletons
which disperse their limbs and skulls variously
and reunite at the sound of mortal presence would
be harrowing, if seen through a blurred atmos-
phere and a mist of whisky strengthened; the bull-
dogs that bite the bobby and strip that officer
to his shirt are gorgeous counterfeits ; and the
bull that tosses the clown into the middle of next
century cannot be too highly commended. There
is a grand Turk who falls to pieces and becomes
one judge and half-a-dozen barristers ; boneless
spectres and astral footmen and impish “komikal
kures,” and an aquarium full of those kind of sea-
monsters that have their birth in a supper-salad.
Altogether, the D’Arc show is the best of its kind
ever seen in Sydney.

The Dan Tracy Vaudeville Company at
Sydney School of Arts fattens on its popularity,
and a new end-man has been introduced in the
person of J. D. Mack, who displays good all-
round quality as comedian, soloist, and foot-
artist. At Sydney Polytechnic, Hiscocks’ Federal
Minstrels have been re-organised with added
delectation to the public; a notable cosmoraraa
lias been sandwiched into the popular nightly
performances ; and Horace Bent, as usual,
exposes the lining of his gizzard to the
public eye. The Alhambra is drawing good
congregations to its concert, olio, and farce,
“ Hard to Kill,” the English comique,
Callaghan, and the “ mockamoor ” Charles Faning
being immense “ takes.” The Bondi and Oogee
Aquariums afford popular satisfaction. The
Cyclorama still draws, having affixed to its pro-
gramme a song, “On Guard,” given with gusto by
Roy Malcolm, in full uniform on the battlefield,
after which he is righteously shot and ambulanced.
“ The Windsor Tragedy ” has been added to the
Waxworks, George-street, the scene representing
“ Williams ” doing the hearthstone-cache trick.

Organist Wiegand gave two well-patronised
organ-recitals last week on Wednesday and
Saturday, the latter being attended by the
Countesses Jersey and Galloway, and lots of the
tail-on-behind elite. The Misses Albu gave a
delightful Sunday-evening concert at Sydney
Garrick, and quite outsang themselves.

The performance of “ Masks and Faces,’’
at Melbourne Opera House, goes far to atone for
many insults heaped upon the grey hairs of that
respectable comedy. Local critics, who have
found excellence in cruel misrepresentations of
the same work, blushed (let us hope) as they
decorated their latest notices with the soiled and
faded eulogies of yore. For the first time these
many years, “ Masks and Faces ” is receiving fair
treatment on the Australian stage. Its chief
characters appeal to the heart, and its little crowd
of minor supporters are satisfactory items in the
bill. The story is old-fashioned, and familiarity
has bred contempt for the impossible picture
incident in Triplet’s garret, but the bright
dialogue and subtle character studies of the
Reade-Taylor play will always make it a fine sub-
ject for artists of real ability. Peg Woffington,
in the hands of Mrs. Bernard-Beere, is an
irresistible sixty-eight inches, or more, of winsome
Irish womanhood—warm-hearted, joyous, brilliant,
tender and brave. The change from weary Lena
Despard to lively Peg is striking, and the actress
who died of poison on Friday seems to have been
born again with a new manner, smile, bearing,
almost another voice on Saturday. A very evident
improvement in health enables Mrs. Beere to do
herself fuller justice in the lighter part. After
dancing a jig she showed some signs of exhaustion,
but there is no historical reason for supposing that
the real Woffington didn't get knocked up on such
occasions. Those who were disappointed with the
British Bernhardt in a sickly drama will perceive
her genius at a glance in this wholesome comedy.
Herbert Standing’s conception of Triplet, the
poor old dreamer, is equally natural and
convincing. Here and there his accent hardens,
and a word betrays Standing to the au-
dience, but, save for these occasional lapses,
the pathetic figure of cultured destitution
is Triplet himself. A better get-up for the part
can’t be imagined. The identity of Marius admits
of no change, anyway, and so Sir Charles Poman-
der is a Frenchman (a genial reminder of
Duqnesne) with all the national talent for speak-
ing with his hands and eyebrows. Otho Stuart
is a beautiful but soft kind of Ernest Vane, whilst
Mrs. Urquhart is also a lovely, feeble suggestion
of the neglected wife. Royce, Frank Emery,
Miss Watson and two of the Pelham children are
the most attractive features in a well-finished
background, and the mounting is worthy of the
performance. Mrs. Beere has one noticeable
fault, by the way. She might drop her voice con-
siderably when speaking asides, and still be
audible all over the house.
* *
“ Sunlight and Shadow ” was received
with gentle satisfaction at the Bijou on Saturday.
It is the slim, genteel narrative (already told in
Sydney) of the typical mature lover who thought
his bad wife was dead when she wasn’t, and is
condemned to suffer grief and pain until that in-
convenient interloper passes hence. The bene-
volent doctor of tradition is also there, and the
stereotyped idiot with a farcical passion for the
frolicsome sister is another reminiscence of those
other comedies from which the average actor-
turned-author, like Carton, invariably takes bis
material. As a well-acted, well-balanced trifle,
“ Sunlight and Shadow ” deserves respect. Miss
Ida Liston made a light but pleasing first impres-
sion, and Miss Emma Temple did well indeed as
the maiden who pines in the shadow for awhile.
For the rest, Titheradge, Cecil Ward, Dion Bouci-
cault, Miss Watt-Tanner, and Arthur Lawrence
were nice as usual, although it is about time that
the latter member of the company did something
fresh with his hands. He has rubbed the novelty
off them.
* * * *
“Bridget O’Brien” reappeared at Mel-
bourne Royal, on Saturday, when there was a
considerable rush to meet the grand old daughter
of Erin and give her a warm reception. There is
no necessity to paint the rampageous lily or gild
her heart of unrefined gold. Bridget has got past
the need of such vanities. Her reputation is
founded upon a rock, and her humour is as ever-
lasting as the wurrm which never dieth. It seems
a pity that a woman of her calibre can’t go through
bfe unattended by a variety show, because such
things arc uncertain and subject to fits of melan-
choly. The fag-end of Saturday’s entertainment,
unrelieved by any glimpses of the immortal
Widow and Mother-in-law, was insufferably dull.
After 12 depressing females, called French Guards,
nad been walking around the stage for about 15
minutes the public began to clear out. However,
a change of variety show is easy to manage, and if
J. F. Sheridan takes care to leave out a number of
attractions and'politely requests several people to
desist, the present season ought to prove fairly
productive.

At the Princess’s they have enjoyed good
houses for “Dorothy,” although the temporary
retirement of Ryley (replaced by Sydnej Deane)
doesn’t make matters go any faster. On Saturday
next (9th.) the actual last hours of Elton will bo
inaugurated by a revival of “The Gondoliers.”
On Wednesday (13th.) they revert to “The Old
Guard,” and on Thursday, the well-beloved little
comedian will benefit in the character of Folydore
Poupart and bid adieu to Australia. Nobody
knows why Elton should leave like this on the eve
of a general election. He might take his choice
of boroughs and waltz to the top of the poll if the
spirit so moved him. And once in Parliament the
only William would be expected to run the entire
Cabinet in his own person, and permitted to in-
crease his salaries all round up to any reasonable
total.

Dampier is another idol of the masses who
could get in for anywhere by a large majority, but
he prefers to devote his talents to booming
“ Wilful Murder.” The crime on the hearthstone
does a steady business, and promises to last until
Easter. One night, last week, Miss Rounsevell
called at the theatre and saw Dampier, and said
that the drama made her shudder when she
thought of all that might have been. There is
some talk of petitioning the Chief Secretary to
give “Williams ” a night off in order that he, too,
may see “Wilful Murder” and enjoy himself
again, but the treat is not likely to come off.
Meanwhile, the Alexandra Williams misses a
point by not pulling his sham moustache out by
the roots, but he is right up to date with “ Gogd
bye, ladies !” when his gory career is arrested by
the law. Other shows are girding up their loins
for the holidays.
At Poverty Point.
The late W. 11. Leake didn’t play lago to Miln’sOthello.
He played Othello when Miln took over the part of lago
from Nat. Douglas.
It used to be industriously reported, also quite com-
monly believed, that Ryley had brought a devoted wife
and family to Australia. Fancy loved to picture him in
the act of romping with five merry children on the hearth-
rug, whilst the smiling mother darned their socks, and
cut little jokes about those ridiculous sassiety women who
were vainly hoping to undermine poor Charley’s domestic
virtues. For the sake of this refreshing fiction, one feels
sorry to hear that the “ favourite baritone ” came to Aus-
tralia without any encumbrances except his luggage, and
has never romped on the hearthrug in the manner stated.
The " Human Fly” is a lady to appear in Sydney and
Melbourne shortly. She walks head-downwards, with
air-exhauster goloshes.
Harwood, in Melbourne, keeps clean-shaved, whereas
he always grows a long black beard when he has deter-
mined to relinquish the smell of the floats; but people say
the beard would be as snow-white now a-days as G. B. W.
Lewis’s.

Coppin came first to Melbourne from Launceston with
a company including Mr. and Mrs. G. 11. Rogers and Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Young. Both Rogers and Young were
afterwards rather better known in Sydney than in Mel-
bourne. Mr. and Mrs. Young went to England, where
they divorced, and the lady married Yezin, with whom
she got on little better. Forty-eight years ago Young
made a good Claude Melnotte, and he was greatly fancied
as William, in “ Black-eyed Susan,” but later he settled
into a low comedian. Mrs. Young married him at 15
.years old, greatly against the wish of her mother, Mrs.
Thomson; and her sister was our old-time Sydney
favourite, Mrs. C. Jones. Coppin introduced the first
carpet on the Melbourne stage, at the Queen’s Theatre,
the play being the “ School for Scandal.”
Meston expects to have his 25 Queensland niggers ready
to start for Chicago in July or August.
Mrs. Nye-Chart (Miss Nellie Rollasson) of the Theatre
Royal, Brighton (Eng.), is dead. It will be remembered
that it was to her that Lefroy, the murderer, last offered
his play. When she refused it, he determined to rob and
murder.
Gilbert Hare, the promising son of John Hare, is
coming to Australia for his health.
Dampier’s advertisement of “Wilful Murder” says
that “ ladies have fainted and strong men have been

W. H. Jude’s first Sunday lecture at Hobart being a
pronounced success the talented composer held three
more, and intends resuming them shortly. Despite his
violent denunciations of sectarian Christianity and his
sneers at orthodoxy, he has been received on each
occasion with literally overflowing houses.
Widdy O’Brien hasn’t taken her stick to Melbourne
with her this trip. She expects to knock ’em just as well,
though.
They said on the programme of Billee Barlow’s benefit,
at Melbourne Royal, the other night, “ the services of the

this fraternal spirit.
“Carmen” is in rehearsal at Melbourne Princess’for

The most delightful thing in theatrical experience is to
elevate a secondary character into the first place, Such
was the treat of Gwendolen Floyd v. Laura Villiers in the
“Dancing Girl.” How Brooke did squelch M’Kean
Buchanan, in Melbourne, by acting lago to his Othellol
Befnard-Beere’s death-scene in “As in a Looking
Glass ” is apparently borrowed from Mdlle. Croizette’s in
“The Sphinx,” with the same trick of turning the face a
greenish hue. Croizette and Bernhardt acted in the piece
together, but the former has abandoned the stage tor
some years.
Oscar Wilde’s play, “ Lady Windermere’s Fan,” suc-
ceeds at the London St. James’, though Oscar was guilty
of the impudence of taking his call with a cigarette

One handles Watts-Phillips’ newly-published biography
with a kindly remembrance of his daughter, Roland Watts-
Phillips. After long and weary waiting, with his play of
“Joseph Ohavigny ” on hand, Phillips gav.e it to a copyist,
named Hastings, for re-production, and Hastings caused
Webster to buy it, as also two other plays, “The Poor
Strollers” and “ Dead* Heart.” Yet was Phillips nearly
worried to death over the delays in production, and his
prodigious success of “Lost in London” might not have
come out hut for being pirated in America. Roland was
named after Madame Roland of the French Revolution,
Phillips being a French enthusiast.

When Macready was young, he complained to his
father, the Birmingham manager, about his neglect of
one ot the actors who shone brilliantly in a casual per-
formance by a small travelling Co. “ Ah,” says the old
man, “my company reduces him to his level”—and so
it was.
G. V. Brooke’s English creditors did all they could to
save his life, for two sheriff’s officers pursued him on
board the London, and Brooke only escaped through
Capt. Martin disguising him as a sailor. Running round
with the others, at the capstan, he would chuckle over
his lucky escape, as he made up once more for William, in
“ Black-Eyed Susan.” Did he think of this, as he stood,
in his red shirt, by the pumps, in the Bay of Biscay?
The long derelict Lyceum Theatre, in Pitt-street,
Sydney, is under way again, the ground lease of the late
owner having been made over to Mr. Walter Ives by the
Equity Court last week. The new building, which is
designed on the lines of the Melbourne Princess’s, will be
ready for occupancy in about six months’ time, and will, they
say, possibly open under the management of a gentleman
whose front names are James Cassius. We have not heard
the surname.
The small boys of Melbourne are off maib’cs in (lie
meantime, also they have discarded cricket and turned
their hearts from football. The all-prevailing pastime of
childhood is a new game called “ Windsor Murder.” In
every school-ground, and in many a grimy backyard, the
slaughter of Mrs. Williams takes place twice a day, or
oftener. Generally speaking, the Windsor tragedy is a
simple, primitive entertainment, but here and there a
high-class performance is got up by a boy of intellect. In
the first place, an urchin (“boss’’-eyed if obtainable),
disguised in a burnt-cork moustache and a hideous scowl,
ignites a heap of dry twigs so as to mark the position of
the fire-place. The lid of a packing case does duty for
the hearthstone, and after much stealthy glancing over
his shoulder, the intended assassin shifts this lid and digs
a shallow grave. His work completed the infant Williams
observes, “ That’ll do.” Hammer in one hand, and a
blunt pocket-knife in the other, the miscreant slinks off
in quest of his prey. Reclining against a tree he finds a
lay figure, composed of a sack tied round a piece of
clothes-prop and surmounted by an old straw h it.
Williams dissembles a good deal at the outset. With
ghastly tenderness he remarks “ It’s a fine day, dear,” to
the unsuspecting scarecrow ; likewise he laughs gaily and
takes a drink from a medicine-bottle. The bottle (which
he has just filled at the school tap) contains neat brandy
calculated to brace him up for the bloody deed. Then he
fells Mrs. Williams with the hammer, administers a horrid
gash under the straw hat, and drags the murdered sack
away to the fireplace. Williams, like all actors who have
got hold of a rich hit of “fat,” would fain linger over the
interment, but voices in the distance are, by this time,
exhorting him to hurry up. So he stamps the corpse
down into the cavity, readjusts the hearthstone, and seals
the awful transaction with cement. After which he
decamps to the West Australian extremity of the
yard, and engages in mining pursuits at a salary
of six apples per week. Presently a mob of
bo3S stroll casually up to the hearthstone, and
pinch their nostrils. They smell something. The aroma
proceeds from the hearthstone, which is raised with great
apocryphal difficulty, and the corpse of Mrs. W. comes
to light. “ Who has done this orful murder?” says the
boy cast for the character of first citizen. They all rush
off to fetch a detective and inform the ’Ekald. The
detective is usually the star performer and stage-
manager. He wears a lawn-tennis hat pulled over his
eyes, and the longest overcoat he can borrow. He is the
embodiment of gloomy mystery and dark suspicion.
After a careful examination ot the remains, the tec. cuts
off a fragment ot sack (observing that it is a clue) and
retires into the woodshed to make enquiries. Thereupon,
the horror-struck citizens dig another hole, a proper
cemetery grave, nine inches deep, and bury Mrs. Williams
amidst vigorous manifestations of woe. ’ The detective
now emerges from the woodshed, carrying a lantern
and a pocket - book, and proceeds to hunt the
criminal down. He has obtained a photograph
of liis father, from the family album, which
will enable him to identify Williams on the spot, conse-
quently a number of boys stand in a row to he compared
with Ihe portrait. “ The man I’m after ain’t here,” says
the officer, in tones that seem to issue from the bottom of
his overcoat. For the moment he is baffled like. Then
he goes on the prowl in a zig-zag line followed by the
general public until at last he turns his lantern on Wil-
liams, and recognises his man by the photo. “In the
name of Lord Hopetoun yer my prisner! ” groans the
detective. Williams is further identified by splashes of
mud-pie on the back of his hands, and a morsel of the
original sack inside his hoot. Anyway he has got to be
hanged. The detective fastens a clothes-line under his
arms, throws the ends over a horizontal bar, or a fence,
and Williams is hauled up and dropped again with a
sickening thud ! But just previous to execution the
villain is expected to confess all. “ How many other
people have you murdered?” asks the detective. “A
hundred and eleven,” says Williams. “ Launch his soul
into Eternity,” says the detective.

Charity in England nowadays is a virtue
that needs to be dragged up by the hair to make
it grow at all. Few people have any idea of the
frantic struggles that are required to keep the
Salvation and similar funds from utter extinction.
Early this year the London G.P.O. was almost
blocked by 100,000 begging letters which the
“Army” had posted in one fatal heap. During
last year Dr. Barnardo sent out a trifle over a
million printed and written appeals for money ;
and other charities or alleged charities carry on
the great cadging industry with almost equal
vigour. Most of the money received by a large
number of these institutions goes in circulars
asking for more money and in postage stamps,
and the employment they provide is mostly to
broken-down clerks who are hired at competitive
rates to address begging letters at so much the
thousand.
Frank Hayes, of Auckland (M.L ), com-
mitted suicide a fortnight ago. First of all he
loaded his gun and tied a ponderous weight upon
the trigger. Another string was attached to the
weight and tied securely to a hook overhead.
This second string was wrapped round the centre
of a candle, and when the candle burned half
through the string would naturally combust, and
then the weight would descend with a portentous
thud, and the gun would go off, and Frank being
at the end of it, would go off likewise. These
arrangements being completed, Mr. Hayes
lighted the candle, arranged the gun with the
muzzle resting on his pillow, lay down with his
head directly in front of it, and took chloroform.
By-and-bye the gun went off, and there the busi-
ness, so far as concerned Hayes himself, was
finished. About a week later Ins landlord burst
the door in while searching for his rent, and took
an inventory of the remains. There was one bed,
one table, one corpse with most of the head gone,
a rusted gun with the muzzle tipped up in the air,
and a weight hanging from the trigger, half a
candle, an empty bottle, and some hair embedded
in the wall.
Jimmy Tyson’s before-lunch transaction
with Treasurer MTiwraith (Q.), when he cooky
purchased <£200,000 worth of Treasury-bills, lias
started a batch of yarns concerning the bachelor-
millionaire. Once, up North, Tyson wanted to
transmit £50,000 to a bank in another province.
The local manager would not at first make any
reduction .in the usual rate of exchange. Tyson
apparently caved in, but a minute later wrote out
a cheque—“Pay self, £300,000.” “ I want it in
gold,” said he, “and at once, please.” The
manager became the suppliant; the other matter
was at once reasonably arranged, and the £300,000
cheque was torn up. A Sydney firm of auctioneers
once offered Tyson £lOOO if he would attend a
land-sale and make a single bid, the idea being
that his apparent anxiety to buy would ensure a
big all-round success. He refused. At Too-
woomba (Q.) railway-station, a broken-down old
mate of Tyson once saw the latter counting over a
big roll of notes. “James,” said he, “one of
those would do me a lot of good just now, and
you’d never miss it.” Turning his back, and
holding out the handful of notes behind him,
Tyson said, laconically, “Help youfself.” And
so forth, in wonderful variation.

A mining bank established on a big basis would
be a sound investment in N.S.W., where the ordinary
banking institutions, under all circumstances, evince tha
strongest aversion to mining securities. Controlled by
mining men and conducted by managers of mining
experience, it would be as safe as any other form o!
banking, it was the means of the success of the Bank ot
Victoria.

The public are hearing a little too much of the

little of the real value of the emeralds already extracted.

Mount Poole is to some shareholders a
“ Marvel.” To us it is the same old story. A rich,
narrow surface-patch. Sensationally rich crushing of
carefully-selected stone, on which is built up a mountain
of exaggeration to which interested local and innocently-
gulled metropolitan newspapers largely contribute.
Company formed, and legitimate work only performed
when the gold has left. The rest—a rapid, inglorious
death, and feeble attempts at resurrection.

The Manar (N.S.W.) Sluicing Co.’s ground and
race—the latter cost upwards of £l2,ooo—have been sold
for £4OO. The purchasers have joined hands with the
purchasers of the Yellow Springs, an alluvial property on
the Shoalhaven which has long languished for the want
of water gravitation. It is proposed to construct a dam
at the head, enlarge the race (which is 22 miles long),
continue it another 20 miles to Yellow Springs and work
the two properties conjointly. A big American mining
man has, after careful examination, declared the project
a genuine one, and there is little doubt some Melbourne
men will put up the money.

Public opinion often gets abend of the best
mining men. Notwithstanding the vaunted declarations
of safety and permanence of the Broken Hill Proprietary
Mine, public opinion judges it insecure and sees the
dividend end at the sulphide levels. Shares have fallen
and continue to fall.

We are asked for an opinion of the Sir Walter
Scott Mine, Cancri, floated two years ago. The reef is
poor in gold, which is of low value. There are other
mines in the country of which much is made of the number
of ozs. while the value of the gold is carefully concealed.

Another evolution in White Hock—the mine
and plant knocked down at £3OOO. Ten times the amount
would not cover the cost of the plant. On anolher occa-
sion upwards of that amount was knocked down on a trip
to the mine. It was a magnificent picnic- special trains,
coaches, free hotel accommodation, enough champagne
to bathe in. Remembrances of that trip cause us to shed
a tear—for those who paid for it.
* * #
Will it make or ruin the purchasers is a query
which time and more money alone will answer. Howell
said it would pay if his recommendations concerning
plant were followed. Upwards of £20,000 was spent in
that direction without success. The writer said of it in
its very infancy that the ore was of too low a grade ever
to pay interest on a million. Lots of people who didn’t!
believe this were ruined. One man alone who made up-
wards of £20,000 on the Barrier lost all of it in White
Rock. It ruined whole families in Adelaide, and by many
others is only remembered as a curse. If one-fiftieth
part of the money wasted in machinery had been spent in
experimental treatment elsewhere the plant would never
have been erected.

One of the owners of the Last Call mine pinned
a quantity of its scrip—which, by the way, was like that
of many other wild cats, a gorgeous document—to the
wall of the Empire Hotel, and turning to Mark Hammond
exclaimed; “It only wants some Taranganbas beside iti
to complete the picture.” “It is not a Taranganba.
without your misrepresentation and deception,” replied
Hammond. “Look here, Hammond,” said the other
fellow, “ whatever becomes of it recollect you bought ther
mine with your eyes open. You were allowed to prospecti
where you liked and as you liked.” Hammond was
deceived not so much by what he did as by what he failed
to do.

Every year incubates some new modes of crush-
ing, yet the old stamper-battery used by the ancients
reigns supreme. It is admittedly an engineering mistake
simply because power is required to lift the stampers and
crushing-power is only obtained by the dropping of then-
own weight, yet nothing has been found to take their
place.

America has nothing to teach Australia in
stamp-milis. After travelling through the States, a
Victorian mining engineer not only failed to find out any
improvement in their mills, but brought back orders for
stamp-batteries made on the Victorian patterns. After
many years this design is re-introduced as the great Cali-
fornian stamp-mill.

What was described as the latest thing in stamp-
mills was imported from Chicago for the White Rock
mine. Upon arrival it was found to be of a pattern long
discarded in Australia, where an infinitely superior plant
could have been obtained for less than half the price.

Many people would like to know if there is no
danger of the thousands of tons of soft wood in the Broken
Hill mines catching fire, and if there is any means of put-
ting it out should a fire break out, A lire in a mine is
the most disastrous of all fires, inasmuch as the smoke
prevents it being got at; hence it is that some mines
have burnt themselves out, and have taken a mighty long
time about it.

Is it true that the filling-up system has been
recently vigorously started at Broken Hill, and that in
some dangerous places, for the sake of expedition, what
are known as pig-styes have been built and filled in with
good ore ?

In the boom, if not now, several of the big
brokers of Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney had workmen
in the Broken Hill mines who were paid to watch and
wire things. In the golden mines of Bendigo. Ballarat,
or Charters Towers, a mine manager would find it a hard
thing to get ahead of his miners.

The holder of several thousands of pounds worth
of shares in a N.S.W. mine, quoted as saleable at, let us
say, £1 a share, grumbled to the writer, the oilier day,
that he was hard-up. On being asked why he didn’t sell
some of his scrip and put himself in funds, he replied,
“Ah ! you don't know the game. I have the reputation
of being a shrewd man, and so long as I hold, the public
hack me and keep the shares at their price. If 1 sold ICO,
they’d be back to five shillings. When we are crushing
with good returns then the public will back the mine;
not until then.”

Silver has now touched 3s. 3d. per oz.. a fall of
4i[d. per oz. since January 1 of this year. Taking the
weekly yield of the Broken Hill Proprietary mine at
200,0000 z., this represents a diminution in value of £3958
per’ week, or £17,000 per calendar month—£2o4,ooo per
annum. The Proprietary has hitherto paid £96,000
monthly in dividends. The weekly yield lias been in-
creased’by 20,0000 z, since the beginning of the year, and
the average of silver to the ton of ore has also increased.

membered, so all the English papers are careful to
mention it in his obituary. Probably if it had

Dr. Wilhelm Junker, the African explorer,

memorable statement :
It is not necessary for an African explorer to kill people
right and left, like a conqueror in an enemy’s land. I
never killed anyone, and mostly travelled without
a weapon, and still achieved what I wanted.
Perhaps it was_ because he never killed anybody
that Junker died almost unknown. And just
here a picture rises before us of a man with a
heavy jowl and dyed hair, and a Bible in his
strong right hand, wading through a sea of gore
and bowels and flogged niggers, to a niche in the
temple of everlasting fame, with the much-
travelled Smythe for his fugleman, and Wales
waiting to receive him in evening-dress on his
return.
There was not long ago, in Melbourne, a
young Hebrew clergyman named Isidor Myers, a
man who lived for others, and who was Rabbi of
the most orthodox 'Jewish congregation in Vic-
toria. He was never tired of declaiming against
usury and the ignominy which it inflicted upon the
race whom God hath certainly chosen, so far as
brains are concerned. “ The Jews,” he said one
day, preaching in English to the Germans,
Russians and Poles who chiefly composed his con-
gregation, “are fit for nobler things. They are
too strong to remain so selfish. Let them cease
worshipping money and look to other and greater
ideals. Let them look, for instance, to Jesus of
Nazareth, who was, after all, a Jew.” It is
extremely probable that the bulk of the Rev.
Isidor Myers’ congregation didn't quite under-
stand him.

Deaceful seclusion at Bendivo in 187 J •-
There are a great many animals (numan) in tins world,
resembling anything almost, rather than the thing they
actually are. But this creature had been hunted by out-
raged humanity from post to pillar, and from a nameless
place to Hackney ; and so he was haggard and restless,
always on the move; nervous, startling, wan, deeply
furrowed, cadaverous and in clothing tattered and torn
by the chase. Being inside the hut awhile I could at
length distinguish what was therein besides the hunted
and haunted man. A couple of giu cases, a concern like
a ship’s tank, on which were some rags and newspapers
(this was the bed), a few kerosene tins, a small wooden
box, some rusty dishes used for mining purposes by
“ hatters ” on the goldfields —these constituted the furni-
ture of the haunted and hunted man’s hut. But a great
branch of gum tree, the top end of which was alight in
the fireplace, the other end reaching almost down to the
other end of the hut, served conveniently to open a con-
versation and to elucidate matters. I asked Fullivan how
it was lie didn’t chop the stick up, instead of burning it
in that queer way. He said he had no axe ; furthermore,
no man in that neighbourhood would lend him an axe ;
also, no man in any neighbourhood would lend him an
axe. And so, little by little I ascertained from Sullban,
in Ills furtive, wild, frightened, nervous way, that lie was
absolutely boycotted by the human race. No one would
hold converse with him, or sell him anything, or lend him
anything. If he did get an odd pennyweight of gold, he
could only dispose of it at one-half of its value. No one
would hear him or answer his “ good day no one wou’d
do anything but stare at him. By degrees Sullivan got
more confidential and reassured, and I heard much from
him that interested me. On the subject of the murders
lie did not long dwell, nor did I press him on these
tragedies, feeling, anyhow, that information from him on
such occurrences would be worse than worthless. Gener-
ally he denied any active participation in any of them.
But of his own mental tortures and sufferings he seemed
not to weary of talking. It appeared he had not very
long returned from the Old Country. On landing at
Liverpool an immense crowd gathered about him, and
audible murmurs of “That’s Sullivan, the murderer!”
buzzed about him wherever lie went. Out of lodging-
houses and public-houses, from wharves, streets, thorough-
fares he was chased by the same awful mutterings—that’s
Sullivan the murderer ! It was to escape this very thing
that he had gone home, but escape from it there was
none. He went into the country. There, for a while, he
had some sort of respite; but very soon the ploughman
and the cowboy began to gaze at him over fences, and he
heard them mutter “ that’s Sullivan the murderer !” At
farm-houses the maidservants ran away from him, crying,
“Oh, God! Sullivan, the murderer!” And children,
going to school, ran hack in terror, to tell their parents
that they had met Sullivan the murderer ! Along with
this, the police dogged his footsteps from one country to
another, from one place to another, from one port to
another, from one town to another. What could he do to
got away from such a horrible hell as this ? What indeed !
There was no get away from it! Like all hunted animals,
he directed his steps towards where lie thought some
semblance of a home lay. He came back to Bendigo.
Several thousand people were at the railway station there,
when he came up from Melbourne, and “that’s Sullivan
the murderer !” was heard as before. At Inglewood the
people got tired of repeating it, and treated him hence-
forth as a dog. What he wanted now was to get away
somewhere without the police knowing whither lie had
gone. There might be a chance, then, of the cry “ that’s
Sullivan the murderer I” no more sounding in his ears.
But there was not the slightest prospect of that, unless
the Government gave absolute directions that he was to
be allowed to go, and that the police were not to know,
or to concern themselves as to his destination. No one
would have truck or trade with this murderer: no one
would sell him anything, much less give him am thine
How then did he live? For the bread-fruit grows not ol
Die gum-tree, and a used-up diggings is a parched mrl
dreary and hungry place withal ! Yes, to he sure von
could not miss thinking it, if you think at all, it was e
woman who supplied Sullivan with food. She came a
long wav every night, in the daikncss, so that no one
should see her. She came with her little bundle of 1,10
visions, and she put them on the threshold of iv
murderer’s door. She tapped tim'dly at the door to let
Sullivan know that his dinner was there, and then she
flitted away into the darkness. Nor storm, nor rain nor
aught else stopped or stayed her ; this timid, dariim’ not
well off, poor little woman. An Irishwoman she" was
and I only mention that fact in order to say that probebl J
she had herself known, and f it, what it was to be elect',
on the high road of this world.
A few years ago, in the glittering days
when borrowed millions were still plentiful in
Maoriland, the constituents of a goldfields mem-
ber resolved to present him with something or
other as a mark of gratitude and esteem. He was
a very silent member in these days, and either he
said nothing at all or else he said something that
wasn’t worth listening to, but he wasageniusatgeb
tinghold of the loan-money, and it was resolved that
he deserved encouragement. Also he was always
hard up, so they took a practical view of things
and sent along a draft for .£lOO. Unluckily they
forgot that, under the bribery and corruption law s
of Maoriland, he was likely to lose his seat if ho
accepted the money. The politician remembered
this fact distinctly, and tore his hair with fury
at the thought of having to return it. Tho'a
a glorious idea struck him. Next, lie cashed the
draft. Finally he wrote a mournful letter in which
he expressed his regret that they should imagine
lie could accept money for his services, and in a
grief-stricken tone he sent the £lOO back per
medium of his own cheque. The constituents
were much impressed by the letter, the local paper
founded an editorial upon it, and it was also
“communicated ” to the press all over the country.
But the cheque, of course, came back from the
bank marked N.S.F., and as the constituents
couldn’t well sue upon it, it remains N.S.F. to
this day.
More than one man, writes “Marooga-
line,” has been chaffed for references to the tree-
climbing fishes of North Queensland, and yet in
some places they are common as frogs, and i have
shot scores on the mangroves at the mouths of the
Russell, Midgrave and Barron Rivers. Ido not
know their southern limit, but Capt. Cook saw
them, or a kindred species, in 177 U, at Thirsty
Sound, opposite the Northumberland Islands.
That is the first mention of this peculiar fish.
They grow up to a foot in length, with a tail
something like an eel, or exactly like that of the
(leratodus Forsteri. By the way, I may mention
here that this remarkable fish, usually known as
the “Burnett salmon,” is named after the late
Win. Forster, of Sydney, who was once squatting
on the Burnett and sent the first specimen to
Gerard Krelft, who named it in 1872. The tree-
climbing fish is not remarkable for beauty. His
eyes are prominent, situated on the top of his
head. When you are passing up a saltwater creek
at low tide they will run across the sand, climb up
a mangrove and ga/.e at you for a minute before
jumping down and rushing into the water again.
The pectoral fins, by which they climb, are really
rudimentary hands, and the fish has either re-
mained stationary for ages, like the Ceratodus, or
is in course of evolutionary transition through
the amphibian stage. In any case he is a
curiosity.
A Funny Game.
A few friends met the other night in a Newtown
store to spend a jovial evening, but as they were
all teetotallers and none of them drank anything
stronger than Clements Tonic, drunkenness was
out of the question. Mac. proposed a game
at euchre, and Jones said they had better play for
something just to give the game an interest and
make it lively, but times were hard, so they did
not care to play for money. Smith, however,
spied a box of Fletcher's bilious and liver pills,
and proposed that each time a man was beaten he
should take a pill, and this made the game lively
and the fun was fast and furious. Simpson
swallowed five, Jones got away with four and
Smith and Hopkins two each and Mac. got off
scot free. The game terminated by a general
exodus at 3 a.m., for Dr. Fletcher’s pills never
labour in vain. They are the best and mildest
pills made and are sold by all chemists and
druggists everywhere; being a positive, safe,
and reliable cure for constipation, liver complaint,
headache, &c. They always give satisfaction.
The proprietors give away £5O (in seven prizes) at
Xmas, for the seven first nearest guesses sent in,
as to how many of these pills a large Clements
Tonic bottle (now full) holds. A guess form is
around every box, and all such forms are eligible
for this competition that come from around a box.
One box of Fletcher’s Pills proves their virtues
and they can be obtained everywhere at Is., or
post free 13 penny stamps, from F. M. Clements,
Newtown, N.S.W.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have, a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place ; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

POLITICAL POINTS
The Victorian general elections will be
neld on 20th instant—next Wednesday week.
Down South, Shiels is spoken of as “ the
maiden Premier’’—presumably because lie has
never been in a coalition.
A verbatim report of Premier Shiels’ cele-
brated Casterton (Vie.) oration would have filled
pi columns of Melbourne Argus.
Sydney Daily Telegraph ascribes the
Australian commercial depression to “blast and
blither.” How about boom and burst?
The opinion (without a fee) of the legal
profession is, that the suspension of the Victorian
Kail way Commissioners was a political outrage.
Said that S A. Premier Playford intends
to resign before Parliament re-opens. Politically
drad politicians: Parkes, Munro, Gillies and
Playford !
John Hurley, lately a N.S.'W. M.P., is
feeling his way with the electors of the Burrinn,
Q., a constituency which he represented some 10
years ago.
Sir Graham Berry is official liquidator of
the Melbourne Mercantile Bank. That is not
quite what ho wants. lie wants to be official
liquidator of Victoria.
The number of persons, and the astound-
ing ignorance of most of them, who were placed
on the list of Js’.P. at last Queensland general
election is past all belief.
“Empire Tea” Harper, when asked at
his meeting whether he was in favour of One-man-
one-vote, said, “Yes, he was in favour of One-
man-one-vote in each electorate .”
Cable : “ The native people of India are
organising with a view of demanding the franchise
and self-government.” Another sign of the con-
tinuous crumbling of the British Empire.
Premier Shiels’ loquacity, his sludge flume,
is intolerable : contrast him with Verdon, who
used to rattle otf a perfect Budget speech in 40
minutes. Nevertheless, with all faults, it is felt
that Shiels is the man of the hour.
Kanaka Griffith’s open confession :
Because certain men will not work, what exclusive
rights have we, any more than Indians. Kanakas, or
Chinamen ?
Speak for yourself, Samuel.
N.S.W, Government has abandoned its
proposed short special session. The main work
promised for next session is—(l) One-man-one-
vote Bill, with Electoral Redistribution measure ;
(2) Local Government Bill; (3) Australian
Federation Bill.
The W.A. Government closed the recent
session of Parliament with a substantial majority
at its back. The relative position of parties was :
—Ministerialists, 21 ; Oppositionists, 9, Reform
of the Constitution is to be. tackled next session,
which will commence in August of this year.
The settlement by the Queensland Govern-
ment of , the Robb railway-contract lawsuit, in
which plaintiff claimed over £104,000, and agreed
to take =£loo,ooo in 41 per cent. Treasury Bills,
has the appearance of being an expedient to get
rid of an awkward difficulty at an equally
awkward time.
Premier Griffith (Q.) has squared the
direct Opposition, which chiefly consisted of the
Squatting Party, by his conversion to Kanaka
labour, and has only a few independent bppoennts
from amongst his former alleged Liberal follow-
ing. Judas himself flourished for a short period,
but Nemesis came in due course.
The Sydney Exhibition Building was
erected under the old Foreign-trade regime to dis-
play the arts .and manufactures of N.S. Wales to
an astonished world. It is now used as a place
for the shoeless dead-beat to sleep in. He is the
principal manufacture of N.S. Wales, so the
structure is fulfilling its purpose to the letter.
Billy Brookes, M.L.C. (Q.), prophesies
that:—
In ten years’ time Kanakas will not be available, and
the position of Queensland will then be ten times worse
than it is now ; while there will also be a vested interest
in coloured labour so great, that coolies or Chinamen will
be substituted for Polynesians.
J. C. Neild, Garrard, and other Ms.P.
were quite in the right in opposing a special par-
liamentary grant to St. Vincent’s Hospital,
Sydney, which, although an admirable institution,
is, from a purely political standpoint, a private
establishment of a sectarian character. It is not
subject to Government supervision, and, on that
ground, the Committee of Supply was illogical
and inconsistent in passing the vote. If St, Vin-
cent’s wants State aid it ought to bring itself
within the provisions of the Hospitals Act without
delay. Similar arguments would apply to Church
af England, Presbyterian, Jewish, or Pagan hos-
pitals, if these existed.
The “ Young Victorian Patriotic League ”
has now been defeated in the two democratic
electorates (Oollingwood and Richmond) in which
it has tried to obtain a footing. The League’s
only result will be to confirm, in his suicidal poli-
tical faith, the poor, under-paid, snobbish clerk
who thinks that the man in moleskins is the
natural enemy of the man in a paget coat.
The burden of the present Griffilwraithiau
sophistry is, that the Kanaka is to be strictly
confined to field-work on sugar-plantations, and
that employers who otherwise use him are to be
subject to very severe penalties. Bunkum ! One
set of politicians is already claiming that maize-
farmers should be allowed the same Kanaka
privileges as sugar-growers; another still more
candid set contend that all employers should bo
permitted to employ Polynesians as they please.
“Freedom of contract!”
Query : Should an Attorney-General (who
may be real or acting-Premier into the bargain)
be permitted to hold retaining fees from persons
involved in civil actions that clearly involve
questions of fraud and criminal conspiracy?
Ought not politics and the administration of
justice to be completely divorced from each other?
In short, should not the Attorney-Generalship be
a non-political office, held by the most suitable
man “during good behaviour,” in the same way as
judicial appointments are held ?

OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE.
The sort of thing you see at the city offices where the smart widow turns the poor old
man’s life-policy into cold cash.
Why is it that, when the daily paper man
is reporting the mcetiugMff the candidate I.is editor
doesn’t like, that candidate is always greeted with
“ironical cheers,” while the other candidate-—the'
one the editor does like—is simply greeted with
“cheers?” What’s the difference between cheers
and ironical cheers, anyway? It reminds us very
much of the grocer whose prices were, “country
eggs, Is. 3d.; selected eggs, Is. 2d.; fresh eggs,
Is, Id. ; good eggs, Is. ; eggs, lOd.” How does
the reporter know which egg it is?
The Queensland Governor’s speech, spoken
into the vice-regal phonograph by the Griffil-
wraith : (1) Tears for the late Clarence; (2) a
Kanaka whoop; (3) a land-grant-railways plea;
(4) a meat-export bribe; (5) economy cant; ((»)
Federation-under-the-Crown grovel; (7) the anti-
separation provincial-districts dummy ; (8) anti-
labour humbug; (!)) railway-freights promises;
(10) a mining-on-private-property suspense; (11)
and a prayer for the Divine Blessing—principally
on the proposed slave-trade, it is presumed.
Graham Berry got a bad reception at
Brunswick and was hooted down. The Age is
half inclined to support Berry this time, so it
points out that the row was caused by an organised
crowd of rowdies from Collingwood, who crowded
out the genuine elector. If the genuine elector
had been able to get in he would have cheered, of
course, but he didn’t get a show. He is always
getting left that way. The genuine elector, by
the way, is the man who votes the way we want.
The organised rowdy from Oollingwood is the
other man.
The N.S Wales Legislative Council has
thrown out the Early Closing Bill by 25 votes to 7.
This is about the only commendable thing which
the Council has done this year. N.S. Wales
doesn’t want a Bill to make any man close his
shop when he doesn’t feel that way ; what it wants
is a measure to prevent him working any employe
more than eight hours per diem, and when that is
provided for, the boss should be allowed to keep
open all day and all night, and thereby furnish
employment for three separate shifts of workers,
if he is so inclined. The rejection of the Early
Closing Bill doesn’t matter —but if- the Council
rejects the Eight Hour Bill when it comes along,
then it ought to be made to feel as if all Gehenna
had broken loose.
In Bananaland Legislative Council, the
Address-in-Reply to the Griffilwraith Kanaka and
Land-Grant-Railway Speech from the Throne,
was moved by Dr. Marks, one of Griffith’s
tamo admirers, and E. B. Forrest, formerly a
Mcllwraithian when to be such was to be a
Griffithphobist, and always a Kanakophile. Its
first adverse criticism came from Billy Brookes,
erstwhile Griffith’s colleague in representing
North Brisbane, when G. was posing as aQueeus-
land Wilberforce. Billy owes bis seat in the
Council to Griffith, but remains solid against
Kanakas. The attitudes of the three Councillors
named, form one of many contemporaneous
incidents which grimly illustrate how “mixed”
party politics have become in Queensland.
The British India mail steamer from Eng-
land arrived on the Queensland coast the other
day, and peacefully dumped ashore 134 more
paupers to add to the starving unemployed. It
would have been about as kind an act if it bad
turned them adrift on a raft in mid-ocean. What
a fearsome load of curses there must be on Grif-
fith’s head—the curses of the people whom he has
brought out to howl for food in a strange land,
and to sleep in dust-bins and against lamp-posts',
and to wander around asking for work where
there is no work to be had, and finally to die
anyhow and to bo buried or left unburied accord-
ing to circumstances ! If we were Griffith, when
the Resurrection comes, we would lie still and
take no notice lest we should meet some of them.
“ The outlook iu Europe ” is so disgrace
fully peaceful at present that the German military
authorities have, it is cabled, decided to declare
Alsace in a state of siege whenever war may break
out. A more obvious attempt to incite a row was
never made by men in buckram. It was open to
German war-mongers to do what they liked in
Alsace in the event of a decent excuse being avail-
able, and to preserve a discreet silence on the sub-
ject until that time arrived. But in the interests
of bloodshed these clanking brawlers are talking
fight, and doing their level best to stir up the
slumbering animosity of France by Act of Parlia-
ment. There would seem to bo very little grit in
German socialism, after all. As soon as a
decorated drone flourishes his sword and raves
about the Fatherland, all the apostles of peace
and progress swallow their principles and grunt
for joy.
The Bulletin portrait of Deeming, as ho
appeared in Darlinghurst Gaol, was reproduced
by Melbourne Herald without acknowledgement.
Queerly enough, The Bulletin, the only paper
which succeeded in obtaining the much-desired
photo, in question, got it through a Melbourne
source.
If the portrait of Williams’ late cemented
relative, as it keeps on appearing in the daily
papers, can be proved to be anything like what
the lady really was when alive, then her bereaved
husband ought to get off. Both Williams’ wives,
in fact, as depicted in the press, look like females
that would have to be married under the influence
of chloroform.
“ Gustav Jovanovitch, the greatest cattle-
breeder in Russia, and called the ‘King of the
Steppes,’ owns 000,000 acres of land, and possesses
more than a million sheep and 34,000 shepherd
dogs.” That means 34 dogs to every 1200 sheep,
putting the sheep down roughly at 1,200,000. We
never shepherded in Russia, but we know what
would happen to a shepherd in Australia if ho
started after a flock of 1200 sheep with 34 dogs.
A deadbeat the other day, at Redfern
Railway .Station, asked an innocent-looking indi-
vidual, whom he had never seen before, for the
loan of a shilling “till to morrow.” The innocent-
looking individual stared open-mouthed at him in
astonishment, and, after recovery, merely said
“ Thank you.” “ What for ?” asked the deadbeat.
“For the information.” The deadbeat requested
an explanation. The innocent-looking one said
tliat for some time he had been much puzzled by
the doubt whether lie was a bigger fool than ho
looked, or looked a bigger fool than he was, and
that the deadbeat had very obligingly settled the
question. The information was undoubtedly
worth a shilling, but, onlheother hand, the dead-
beat had seriously hurt his vanity by the implied
reflection on his physiognomy.. Moreover, by
keeping the shilling, he would be teaching the
deadbeat the folly of judging by appearances.
The coin wasn't forthcoming.
Stead has been persistently booming tho
much-puffed electro-homccopathic remedies of the
Italian Count Mattel, who claims empirically to
cure, amongst other ailments, influenza and
cancer. The perusal of a few snips from this
person’s charlatanry should be sufficient for most
people. Amongst a lot of other directions auent
the treatment of influenza:—
Take Febrifngo No. 1 in the second dilution, alter-
nately, with a melange of Angioiticd 3, Pectorale 1, and
Canceroso 1, in the second dilution, a teaspoonful every
ten minutes.
Two drops of white electricity (!) in a dessert-spoonful
of water every hour till the fever is reduced.
White electricity spoused over the forehead will greatly
relieve the acute pains nearly always felt in that region.
Asa preventive against infection, take five globules of
Scrofoloso Giaponne dry on the tongue night and
morning.
“ White electricity !” Bah ! Bring us some blue
lightning, iced, frosted over with green ether,
frozen solid ; a bat’s sweetbread, the dorsal fin of
a platypus, the caul of a bunyip, the smoked
duodenum of a rattlesnake, the off-hind kidney of
a gohanna, the gall-bladder of a frog, all bashed
into a melanye of snails’ jelly, and impregnated
with three actinic beams from the demon-star.
Algol.
What People Say.
A. J. SCOTT, Esq., LAUNCESTON,
TASMANIA.
Writes from Daily Telegraph office:—“ln
justice, and in the interests of similar sufferers,
I write this in the hope that many in trouble may
be induced to try Clements Tonic, also that the
sale of such a genuine article may be increased.
My wife was a dreadful sufferer from neuralgia
for over tvyelve months, she had all kinds of
remedies without the slightest benefit, but after
seeing Clements Tonic advertised in the local
papers for some time, I procured a bottle, and she
found considerable benefit in two days, in fact felt
better after the first few doses; she continued
Clements Tonic until one and a half bottles were
taken, and now, I am thankful to say, she is per-
fectly well and has had no return of the pain, and
we have great hopes that the cure will prove’ per-
manent. You may use this unsolicited testi-
monial, fuller particulars at the above mentioned
address. 1 ’
A. J. SC OTT.
Such influential and conclusive evidence as this
reaches the proprietors of this wonderful remedy
by every mail. When spontaneous praise like
this is heaped upon an article it absolutely proves
its bona tides.
A slight cold often proves the forerunner of a
complaint which may be fatal. Avoid this result
by taking Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, the best remedy
for colds, coughs, and all throat and lung
d i seases.

“ The police think Deeming possesses the
/are faculty of altering his facial expression at
will.” After the publication of this in all the
daily papers, what a farce will be the ceremony of
having the prisoner identified by the Melbourne
tradesmen !.
# # *
Dear Bulletin, —Why on earth should we
have only “ detective diagnosis ” in this Deeming
ease ? Doctors who have seen sham epileptics
(not at all uncommon in the army and navy)
are procurable, and can dress as watchers. If poor
Victoria can’t afford that, let Detective Cawsey
put soap in Deeming’s eye the next time he has a fit.
If he screws the eye violently up, he is shamming,
and every good doctor can swear it. Surely some-
thing like this will be done. And let the watchers
be forbidden to gratify the struggling Deeming
(i.c., if he is shamming) by holding him. In hos-
pital we stretch them on the floor, and allow the
air to do the wrestling—a much more humane
plan.—Yours truly, M.D.
* * *
London Daily News says that valuable
results will be obtained from the moral anatomisa-
tion which will go on during Deeming’s trial.
True : it will lie found, should the prima-facie
case be elaborated to conviction, that in Mr.
“Williams” is reincarnated the soul of Henry
VIII.
* * #
“ Detective Cawsey has also found amongst
D eeming’s things a new wedding-ring, which has,
however, been slightly used. This is belu ved to
have been the one worn by the murdered woman
at Windsor, and intended for Miss Ronnsevelle.”
Don t shudder, ladies. When you marry a
widower you never can be sure that the ring he
gives you has not been manufactured from the
gold plate of his deceased wife’s teeth, stolen from
her mouth after death by the undertaker.
The alleged Windsor murderer made Ids
greatest mistake in select’ug police-ridden W. Aus-
tralia as the scene of future operations. Another
big mistake was that made by The Bulletin in
omitting to print a long article written by its
valued contributor “ Dipso.,” who, during the
police-search for “ Williams,” proved to his own
satisfaction that the man wante-1 would probably
make for West Australia.
# # #
Several shopkeeporsin a Melbourne suburb
are haunted by a certain young lady whews addicted
to dropping into their emporiums at all hours of the
day and telling what she knows about “the
monster” (Deeming) in a loud voice across the
counter. For a time the story was interesting
and good for trade, but since all the customers
have heard it three or four times, and feasted
their eyes to repletion upon the fair young
narrator, there is apt to be a hasty retreat of the
public when she comes along with the same old
lot of particulars on the tip of her dear little
tongue. Wherefore the shopkeepers in question
begin to regret the Windsor tragedy, and all the

Marshall Lyle, engaged todefend Deeming,
has been the most puffed and paragraphed solicitor
in Melbourne for some months past. But how
came it that Deeming wanted to hire anybody for
such a notorious job? He should have put his
case up to auction, with a thumping reserve on it.
« * *
Deeming hadn’t been half-an-hour in Mel-
bourne Gaol before Chief-Secretary M‘Lean,
attended by Jenkins, Clerk of the Legislative
Council, came to inspect the prisoner.

Apropos the fact that Deeming appears
to have removed his moustache with a piece of
glass bottle, the South Sea, Islanders employ the
same makeshift. The idea is adopted from Job,
who took him a hunk of potsherd to scrape him-
self withal. However, there are pretty good
reasons for believing that Mr. Deeming is not the
man to endure the reproaches of .his wife as long
as Job did.

Bathurst’s glory in the present Deeming adver-

Chief Justice Darley, it is announced, will
preside, at Deniliquin Circuit Court, to be held
next week, in place of Justice Windeyer, who in
ordinary course would have taken this circuit.
The Bulletin wonders if this alteration has been
made because the man on whose evidence the
Frenchman, Cordini, tried before Judge Windeyer,
for alleged murder, was hanged, is to be tried for
alleged attempted murder. It will be remembered
that Cordini strongly protested bis innocence-
even on the scaffold—and that his solicitor and
counsel both impugned the fairness of his trial.

Theauthorities of a certain Western N.S.W.
Corporation Saleyards are very particular indeed.
When their attention is drawn to any cancerous
beast, the animal is not sold as fat beef; oh, dear
no ; it is “ bought after the sales and killed in the
presence of the police.” Then “the cancerous
portion is destroyed by fire, and the health))
portion (?) given to the pigs.” What price, now,

For ten years past, the average fatalities
from snake-bite in Victoria were four per annum.
That was before the infallible strychnine cure was
discovered. Now there seems to be a boom in
snakes, and already this season sixteen persons,
all of whom would otherwise have died, have been
saved by means of the new remedy. The situa-
tion is almost this. A person is bitten by a snake
—in nine cases out of ten a harmless animal of no
account at all. Then sundry kind friends seize
upon him and fill him up with brandy till he is
fearfully and horribly drunk. When the doctor
arrives he simply diagnoses him as a person in a
comatose condition, which he certainly is, and
saves him by a strychnine injection, lie wakes
up with a much enlarged head and all the other
signs of having been out on a tear, and these are
set down as the after-effects of snake-bite. The
idea of enquiring about the snake never occurs to
anybody.
An exciting scene took place at a fashion"
able Sydney boarding-house on a recent Saturday
night. A Hebrew money-lender who had a bill-
of-sale over the furniture swooped down with a
couple of delivery-vans and dragged the beds from
under the astonished boarders, who were left at
two a.rn. in a furnitureless house. A pelting rain-
storm was raging at the time, and into this the
furniture was bundled amid the howls of the land-
lady and'the boarders.

In one cabin of the Ormuz (just arrived
from England) four girls came to Australia to be
married. No. 1, on reaching Albany, had to be
introduced to her intended; she had quite for-
gotten him —not having seen him for six years.
In five minutes she broke off the engagement.
She goes back to ma per first mail steamer. At
Adelaide, No. 2 leaned over the steamer’s side,
and nestling against a certain valiant sea-dog, she
simply ignored the expectant bridegroom. No. 3
sprang joyfully into her hero’s arms at Melbourne;
No. 4 did ditto in Sydney. Woman is constant-
-50 per cent, of her. The Ormuz has the record
for the coming brides’ list. A couple of years ago
she brought a consignment of seven to Sydney

The only regretable feature of the sale of
the Hay-Berry estate (Shoalhaven district,
N.S.W.) was that £lOO,OOO had to be raised in
order to be sent out of the province as a donation
to St. Andrew’s University, Scotland, in accord-
ance with the will of the deceased millionaire,
Berry. Much gratuitous heat has been wasted
over the prophesied injustice which threatened
the tenants, who would be compelled to quit their
holdings and abandon their improvements with-
out a chance to secure the freeholds of the lands
they had learned to look upon as their life
portions; but it must now be admitted that
Mr. Hay has acted, in bush phrase, “like a
white man.” With one exception, all of his
tenants have been allowed to acquire the free-
holds of their ground. In several instances ho
actually stopped the competition in favour of
the bidding tenant.

case in Sydney last week, returned with this find-
ing Verdict for the plaintiff; damages, one

Court smiled at the last order, but let the jury go
without snorting at the breach of judicial
privilege. As the N.S.W. law (Reids Act

Burdett Smith, M.L.C., has hinted that

At Orange (N.S.W.) a man named John
Jupp has been committed for trial for shooting an
individual who came round and “ tin-kettled ”
him on his wedding-night. We can’t remember,
just at this moment, whether .Jupp killed the
other man or not, but if that obnoxious person is
really dead, or even horribly disfigured, The
Bulletin seriously contemplates opening a sub-
scription for the prisoner. The man who goes
round to another man’s house and there makes a
deafening clamour on a kettle, or vociferates on a
kerosene-tin, is a public enemy, a clown, and
a maniac, and the person who shoots him
deserves well of his country. When the law
doesn’t protect a man then he has to protect him-
self, and as there is no statute that deals in any
efficient manner with the dancing dervish who
makes night horrible at his friend’s keyhole, Jupp
did the only thing that anv reasonable man could
do. Hi s methods, no doubt, were somewhat
crude—a person of a more collected mind would
have invited the tin-kettle person in to have some
refreshment, and then secretly poured boiling-
water over him and cemented him under the
hearthstone; but it is probable that Jupp did the
best he could under the special circumstances of
tile case.

A Eurasian masher, who has been on a
visit to Fremantle, W.A., has eloped with a
society blossom who is closely related to “all the
fust fam’lies ” of the Cinderella colony, and whose
parents are wealthy. The lovers are half-way to
the Eurasian’s native Bombay by this time, and
have managed to leave behind them a report that,
before their departure, they were married by
special license. This marriage, by the way, recalls
a case in which a rich Chinese married (in Vic-
toria) a sister of the wife of a haughty potentate,
who moved in the most “ utter’’ circles. It quite
broke up that potentate to be asked by all the
little street-boys concerning the health of his

The collapse of St. Joseph’s Building
Society (Sydney) appears to have come about
through a certain pious and kind-hearted fuzziness
on the part of everybody concerned. There seems
to have been no actual embezzlement, no inten-
tional fraud, no desire to do wrong to anybody-
only everybody concerned was a warm-hearted
Irishman, and he threw- the accounts off his chest,
in a manner of speaking, instead of keeping them
in the ordinary business way. When any borrower
failed to pay his instalments good old St. Joseph
would let him slide and allow him to live rent-free
for ages before it hunted him up." It never pur-
sued a debtor with any vigour. It lent money
before the mortgage was prepared, and, sometimes
never got any mortgage at all, and the securities
seem to have been kept in the safe, or in any
officer’s hind pocket, or behind the door, or any-
where. In short, it muddled away <£55,000 in a
cheerful, fat, benevolent way with an aroma of

The same old crow on the same old tree -•

A BAR-BOY’S HOWL.
I love a barmaid ! Ne’er was passion rasher—
-0 ! help me, Bacchus, god of wine, to mash her !
Her name is Lily ; fair she is and chaste,
And scarcely twenty (leastways, round the waist).
In vain I struggle with my strange emotion
1 cannot eat, I’m kept alive by lotion ;
I haunt her pub. like any bony spectre,
In sly flirtations fearing to detect her.
But if, perchance, she rouses black suspicion,
She merely says that “ girls in her position
Must try to please e’en men they couldn’t care for”
(Yet, what does she let Spoffkins stroke her hair for’)
'Tis bitter sweet, this cross-the-countcr wooing
(Pour “ bob ” a day in sixpences I’m “ blooing ”),
Her depth of love I get no chance of testing,
For when she’s “off ” she swears she’s always “ resting.”
I think she’s true, and virgin pure, and tender
(.She wears six rings, hut those her cousins lend her,
Or so she says). My heart is very trusting.
I write these lines to save myself from busting.

An “ influential colonist” lias written the
Queen’s Private Secretary, to suggest that Prince
George of Wales should be called “Duke of Aus-

in Sydney by a crank who proposed, during
the Duke of Edinburgh’s visit to this country,
that he (Alfred) should be proclaimed King of
Australia. By the way. Sir Henry Parkes, in his
recent interview with a Pall Mall Gazette man
at Sydney, appears to have advanced arguments
which can only be regarded as pleas for the
ultimate establishment of a Royal family in Aus-
tralia.

The suggestion that George of Wales

A wise American dame has extracted from
a heap of statistics the discovery that nine-tenths
of the children of college-bred women survive
infancy, and this she considers to be convincing
evidence that a knowledge of the classics and a
good grounding in mathematics assist the produc-
tion of healthy babies. It is a pleasant, scholarly
theory for the sweet girl-graduates to swear by,
but infant mortality is a question of money all the
same. College-bred women are apt to many men
who can keep them in circumstances which-give
the little strangers a fine show to exist. The sur-
vival of the “ best off ” is, as the statisticians wdl
tell you, the great rule of baby lifo. Our Gracious
Queen gave nine pledges of affection to Saint
Albert, and most of her daughters have contri-
buted largely to llm population of palaces, but the
loss of a young plant has never happened to cast
a gloom over any of these Guelphio nurseries. In
many instances the infants were so sickly that the
cold wind of poverty would have withered them
in a fortnight, whereas careful treatment under
glass preserved them to the taxpayer and developed
them into comparatively healthy subjects for the
loyal illustrated newspapers.

who are not bow-legged are mostly knock-kneed
instead—it all depends on which angle their legs
gave way at. Also, don't place implicit confidence
in a man who is furnished with straight legs—as

he lias “stiffened ” one or two of the jury, or he
has reason to suspect that they have been stiffened
by the man on the other side. It is no secret that
there are men in the Australias' who get their
living, and good livings, too, by “ squaring ’

Dear Bulletin, —In re your article on
leprosy. For years I’ve not permitted the buy-

pay a little more to the white man. Last week our

vegetables he had to buy some from a Mongol.
It seems there’s no evading the yellowskins in any
way; so, if we must have leprosy, let us have it
on the cheap. Apropos, one does not hear much
about the disease being prevalent in those cities of
America which swarm with Chinese. —Yours

Dear Bulletin, — Your article on “ In-

Victorian farmer, whose son passed a first class
exam, at the Dookie Agricultural College. A
friend offered congratulations, and remarked that
he supposed Bob would soon be home to help him
manage the farm. The old man stood aghast at
the idea, and energetically replied, “No blanky
fear.” “Well, what are you going to do with
him ?” asked the friend. “ Make him a Professor

The shareholders of the Centennial Land
Bank (Melbourne) found some gratifying informa-
tion waiting for them at their last annual meeting.
The “ bank ” was originated in the boom period,
and while that joyous time was on it used to buy
land in all directions, regardless of consequences.
Now its chief business is to get rid of the same
land, also regardless of consequences. It bought
one estate for £115,000, paying £45,000 cash and
giving bills for the balance, and now in its old age
it has given the land back gratis to the original
proprietor, and let him keep the £45 000, on con-
dition that he returned the promissory notes and
allowed the painful subject to drop. It paid
£lO,OOO on another property and gave bills for
£24.000, and now it feels thankful to lose the
£lO,OOO and the land and have nothing more said
about it. The directors are also making efforts to
recover debts due to the bank ; they spent £2O in
selling up a man who owed them £2OOO, and the
net proceeds of the “estate ” were £2 Os. Bd. It
pays better to be a coffee-stall than a bank in
these times.

What kills the average new daily paper in
the long run ? The insane craze for an eight-page
sheet. A new eight-page paper on the average
eats its own head off in waste paper and use! ss

curses of its shareholders.

A Northern parson who chimes in with the

that the parson sells his photos, to Ids Kanaka

It is now about time that Manly bad some
other means of communication with Sydney than
by steamer. One day the stearing-gear of one of
the boats will go wrong between the Heads in a
heavy beam sea, and the boat will drift on to the
cliffs and be smashed like an eggshell, to the utter
wiping* nit of 200 or 300 Manlyites. Manly will
then be the black beast of the insurance-societies
and will be better stocked with widows than any
other place in the county of Cumberland.

The most urgent needs of the Woolloo-
raooloo and other Sydney suburban swimming-
baths, with the exception of those at Manly, are
disinfecting rooms and a deodorising apparatus
for tiie use of persons befouled by fetid swims.
Why should people swim in sewage?

‘ ‘ used your August Flower for sev-

* ‘ own use, and found it does me
more good than any other remedy.
“ I have been troubled with what I
‘ ‘ call Sick Headache, A pain comes
‘ ‘ in the back part of my head first,
and then soon a general headache
until I become sick and vomit.
“At times, too, I have a fullness
“ after eating, a pressure after eating
“at the pit of the stomach, and
‘ ‘ sourness, when food seemed to rise
“ up in my throat and mouth. When
‘ ‘ I feel this coming on if I take a
“little August Flower it relieves
“ me, and is the best remedy I have
“ ever taken for it. For this reason
‘* I take it and recommend it to
“ others as a great remedy for Dys-

ÜBLIC NOTICE
BEDDING.
There is perhaps no part of House-Furnishino
as to the genuineness and value of which the publi
are so entirely dependent upon the nraerL>„i
knowledge and a
COMMERCIAL MORALITY
of vendors as
BEDOIKTGr,
and certainly the importance and the necessity for
pure, suitable, and properly manipulated materials
cannot be overrated.
A ricketty and badly finished article of Furni.
ture may annoy, and an ill-designed sideboard or
cabinet offend good taste ; but, even then no
serious harm occurs. But with improperly nur’ifioß
or badly made BEDDING, how different the tale
for then you have that which is INJURIOUS
to HEALTH, and undoubtedly SPREADS
DISEASE.
See report on Typhoid Fever and other diseases
in Sydney and suburbs from 1876 to 1891.
See Census and Industrial Returns for 1891.
COMPARATIVELY FEW FURNITURE
WAREHOUSES IN SYDNEY
manufacture the bedding they sell, but, buying
from wholesale makers, have to offer their cus-
tomers Made-up Goods, of the contents of which
they actually know nothing.
Let us consider for a moment that one-third of
one’s life is spent in bed. Does it not concern you
to know that so great a part of life’s short span
ought to be carefully and properly provided for ?
Have you ever taken the trouble to examine
your mattress to find out what is in it? Whether
HORSEHAIR or HOG HAIR,
WHITE JAVA KAPOK,
OR ONLY THAT
VERIEST OF RUBBISH,
THE OLD BLACKRAG FLOCK,
Or that short, seedy Indian Kapok called
Cotton Fly ?
Be wise, be wise. Do not let another day pass
until you have thoroughly examined your bedding.
Those Drapers, Ironmongers, Co-operative
Societies, and others who simply take orders for
bedding from the
PRICE LIST OF CHEAP MAKERS
are still worse off, having no knowledge whatever
of its manufacture, and are governed simply by
CHEAP PRICE LISTS,
and in many instances just place the order with
whatever wholesale maker offers them the greatest
discount.
Nor is this the only disadvantage their customers
suffer, as too frequently the bedding is supplied
by small makers, who have neither adequate
machinery to prepare the materials nor suitable
premises in which to carry on the work. Indeed,
if the purchasers of bedding could only see the
condition and surroundings of some of the makers
of bedding they would not allow the bedding to
come within coo-ee of their backyards, let alone
their bedrooms.
LAWLERS, of GOB George-street, Brickfield-
hill, have for many years manufactured all Bedding
upon their OWN PREMISES, importing the
materials DIRECT, employing the most improved
machinery, and having the work turned out under
their own supervision. We therefore can
GUARANTEE UNPRECEDENTED
VALUE
and Unrivalled Purity in whatever Bedding or
Upholstery leaves our steam factories. The enor-
mous increase in our Bedding and Wire Mattress
Department is perhaps the best proof that
LAWLER’S
efforts to supply only pure and wholesome and
healthy bedding at moderate and popular prices
have been thoroughly appreciated.
The Manufactories ADJOIN the Warehouse in
George street (608), and customers are invited to
see the machinery in motion and witness the pro-
cess of manufacture.

“ The Breaker ” : You have been anticipated in
“ That Terrible Twang” by Edmund Fisher’s “The fly in
the ointment with Mary was her horrid colonial twang.”
“Flaneur” (Wallendbeen); To hand “Muriel”:
As we have no experience in music-publishing you must
write to one of the leading firms—Paling’s or Nicholson’s,
Sydney ... “ Laz ” : Burdett Smith’s complaint that the
President of N.S.W. Legislative Council occupies a little
room “into which he cannot invite any distinguished
visitors,” only again reminds us that Cupid has “ distin-
guished visitor” on the brain... “E. Morton”: The
genuine “Jack the Ripper” undoubtedly wrote his
capital “ Js” in French fashion... “ Gripman Thanks...
“ John T. T.”: Thanks “Paul Mell ” : To hand....
“ W.W.”; Why shouldn’t a first-class detective be well-
paid ? In New York the ordinary policeman begins at £4
weekly, and distinguished service is liberally rewarded
. . “Reader”; One-man-one-vote means one vote, no
more, no less, for every sane man outside gaol, whether
he can read and write or not “H.J.K.”: (1) He is
English, he lived in Australia several years as a journalist.
(2) It has not yet been republished, but soon will be ..
“0.A.C.” (Paddington): Too unfinished-looking. Your
hero goes away to become a great author, and comes back
a leper, with a roll of MS. pressed against his infected
chest. Do you mean that leprosy and authorship go
together, or what? “H. Montague: An eminently
surprising story, but if we stated in print that a man
walked into the Q.N. Bank, Brisbane, and threw snakes
at the manager till that gentleman granted him an un-
secured overdraft, we would be charged with undermining
the financial institutions of the country “Smiler II.” :
Thanks “F.C.”: We draw the line at bogus palimp-
sests about kings, jesters, and people who say “Gra-
mercy!” Go to! “Ishmael”; Is it a new version of
the “Blood-drinker’s Dream,” or what? “Sydney”:
Your frantic picture of Parkes leading an insurrection in
Gehenna is declined. (1) It is unkind to Parkes ; (2) it is
unduly rough on Gehenna “ A.M.S.” (Melbourne):
You say, “in silence he strode from the room.” That
ruins it right there. Nobody has ever stridden in this
paper yet, and nobody ever will. Whenever a writer
begins to make his characters “stride,” he had better
quit the business “T. Davenport” (Sj'dney) : A
stolen cow put into verse seldom amounts to much,
and your cow is no exception to the rule
“ M.C H.” : Simply drivel, and very plain drivel at that..
“Adolphus”: Thanks. Subject already dealt with
“M. 8.” (Newtown): We can’t stand two columns of
solemn inusings about Deeming, even if they were in-
teresting musings— which yours are not “Edward
W You say your “tale is written expressly for
The Bulletin in that bright, crisp style which seems
suitable.” We have got the tale all right, but the bright,
crisp style hasn’t come to hand. You must have sent it
along separately “ S.T.T.” (Brisbane): We regard
MTlwraith politically as a ruined renegade, but even yet
he is not one-tenth so bad as Griffith. Mac., at all events,
never posed as a philanthropist, a saint, and an advanced
Socialist, and when he goes back on his principles he
doesn’t profess to do it from the highest Christian
motives ... “Stone-broke ” : A poet who uses such rhymes
as “ Black ” and " car,” “ gab ” and “ job,” “ visit ” and
“ forget it,” is a blot on our civilisation. Are you the
man who made “oysters” rhyme to “lobsters” last
week?... “C.C.S.” (Sydney): The Pall Mall Gazette
man isn’t worth all that excitement “ W.G.M.” : You
start:
"Paw him!” Great Scott!.... “A Tonser ”: The
purpose of a joke is to amuse ; a joke that only calls
forth tears and makes one wish he were dead is a vain and
hollow things “ Woolloongabba ” : Too lengthy, and
the humour is of the protracted kind which won’t con-
dense “ T. Thompson ” : We haven't room for descrip-
tions of Asiatic scenery and timber yards at Moulamein.
....“Nemo” (Wellington): We will always be glad to
receive good paragraphs of general interest, but a weekly
letter is too great a demand on our space ; moreover, it
would bind us down, and we aren’t going.to be bound down
.. “ Prad Eighteen verses about nothing. Moreover, you
try to rhyme “hankered” with “could not get,” and
“sore” with “chew,” and enclose two foreign stamps which
are no use here. .“C. A. Lade” : Received with thanks..
“ M.J.C.” (Bourke): Your peremptory request that we
will “insert in our next issue” a horribly dull joke about
two alleged persons named “ Dynamite and Jehosaphat,”
and also forward a copy of the paper in order that you
may read your own wheeze gratis, is duly to hand. ..
“A.A.”: Yes, there is an equal objection to black,
yellow, brindle, piebald, skewbald, or mottled labour....
“Win. L.” (Melb.): Many thanks “The Idler”: We
had a miserable time while reading your “ Few happy
moments.” “ Wat Tyler”: Received, with thanks...
“Optic”: It reminds us very much of something that
somebody else once told us he had read somewhere before,
“Banana”: To speak candidly, we don’t like your
“ episode it is utterly and incurably commonplace
“Socialist” (Cairns, Q.): Thanks, but we dealt with the
subject last month “ Sir ’Enry”: The old trouble.
Under a mistaken impression that strict truth improves a
story, you have sacrificed picluresqueness to accuracy.
We don’t care whether your tale is true or not
“ M.D.” : It won’t “ wash." “ Sugar Planter ” (C.T.):
To hand “J.8.M.” <Ad): Will read.... “Tuarangi ”
(M.L.); To hand “Tawhi” (M.L.): Shall be glad to
do so when you arrive “ F.M.” : You ask us to print a
first-class libel about that mining-expert “W.J.0.”
(Wah.): Will endeavour to decipher...." J.H.G.”:
Thanks. The “ Kensington ” was a slip. We have never
heard Coffin “ Coro ” : Of course, under the coming
system of juries fixing sentences, the judge will denote
the maximum and minimum allowed bylaw “H.S.”
(Carcoar) : Tub Bulletin told the story of Dr. Thornton,
Bishop of Ballarat. Moreover, it was true of that gentle-
man “ A.L.0.": The Tunnock revelations, now sup-
plied by the Melbourne press, were first made public by
Tins Bulletin several weeks ago.
A rumour is spread that J. Frost is dead,
So we rushed to his pub where we saw him ;
The heat was intense, so we bore the expense
Of several pints, as we paw him.

SICKNESS CURED, HEALTH PRESERVED and LIFE PROLONGED by Dr. A. WILFORD HALL’S GrREA-T HYG-lEKIIC DISCOVJERY.
The treatment disclosed is unfolded in the “Health Pamphlet”—a condensed prescription of 48 pages. To read and study this pamphlet is to gain a fund of physiological, pathological and
therapeutical knowledge that a hundred times the cost of the pamphlet would not purchase from its owner could it be given back and blotted from his memory.

h ‘ C ) ’ n °r is it any sort of a patent medicine
>■ s } nce there is not a grain o f medicine of any

this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption-
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in,
eluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her v:ork unimpeded.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our j ust
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
The Australian Temperance World says“ We can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Australian Star says:—“lt is thoroughly purify-
ing, hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
The Ecuo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
I 3 everywhere recommended as the best rem-
edy for the cure of scrofula, scrofulous and
cancerous humors, chronic catarrh, eczema,
boils, pimples, sores, and all disorders origina-
ting in impure blood. It neutralizes and elimi-
nates the acids that cause rheumatism, gout,
and dropsy. It regulates the liver and kidneys,
gives tone to the stomach, increases the appe-
tite, aids digestion,
Cures Dyspepsia,
and makes the weak strong. No other blood
purifier is composed of such carefully selected,
highly concentrated, and skilfully united in-
gredients. For nearly half a century this prep-
aration has. in both hemispheres, been the
standard tonic and strengthening medicine. It
it universally approved by the medical profes-
sion. and benefits the enfeebled system at all
seasons of the year.

Brigalow Mick.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A dandy old horseman is Brigalow Mick -
Which liis name, sir, is Michael O’Dowd
Whatever he’s riding:, when limber is thick.
He is always in front of the crowd.
A few tangled locks that are fast turning white
Crown a physog. the colour of brick.
But as keen as a kestrel’s -as bold and as bright
Is the blue eye of Brigalow Mick.
lie is Martin’s head-stockman, on Black-Cattle Creek
All the boys there are rare ones to lide
But Mick is the “ daddy and far you may seek
Ere you find such an artist in hide.
lie’ll turn out a halter, or stockwhip can make,
As you’ve seldom cast eyes on before ;
And never the “nugget” was calved that could break
Michael’s whips, which he plaits by the score.
All the lads on the station are handy enough,
Nor are frightened of grafting too hard,
But Mick, if the cattle are rowdy and rough,
Is the pick of ’em all in a yard.
A bad colt to tackle—a mad one to steer
Through thick timber—you’ll hear Martin boast—
Mick yet is unrivalled, there isn’t his peer
Bight from Camooweal in to the coast.
Ay ! long may it ho ere the scrubs are bereft
Of the clearskins that give us the spoi t,
And long may the station have stock-riders left, ■
Of the build of old Brigalow's sort.

A yam from “ below.” He was one of
a noted family of gold “ shakers ” (an old creed)
and got a job at a rich mine on a new field. At
crib-time he came “on top,” and hunted up the
manager. “Say boss, I’m full up, aint goin’ t’
work in this here blankety dash mine of yours.”
“ Hello ! what’s wrong—too wet for you ?” “ No,
but your gold’s too infernally fine.”
It was Willoughby Andrew, now serving a
life-sentence for murdering J. H. Bartlett, in
Sydney, who acted as agent when Frederick
Bailey Deeming, charged with the Windsor (Vic.)
and Rain hill (Eng.) murders and about 1100 other
crimes, assured his life with the A.M.P. Society
at Rockhampton in 1883. Deeming’s then recorded
height was 5ft. Sin. According to his Darlingburst
Gaol record it is 5ft. 4iin.
A Hughenden (Q.) man sat in his private
office in converse with a clerk. In a half-opened
drawer, plainly v : sible to the clerk, was a bundle
of bank-notes. The employer was called out for a
few minutes. Not a soul entered the room during
his absence, but the clerk had stayed behind a
little while. When the employer returned, the
notes were missing. . . . Now, had this been
a case of life and death, circumstantial evidence
would have hanged that clerk, . . . A quarter
of an hour later, the employer was crossing his
backyard and saw a torn note—one of the lost
bunch—being blown along by the wind. In a
corner, a terrier pup was worrying the remainder,
which, however, were rescued in time to fully make
up the tally'.
The S.M. Herald recently set itself the
congenial task of proving that 1S.S.W. Protection
had locally raised the price of candles—“the light
of the poor”—by |d. per lb., while tallow, the
raw material of candles, had actually become
cheaper. This, of course, was the importers’ side
of the story. The Sydney Soap and Candle Co.
replied, showing that tallow had increased in cost
by £2 per ton, while the felling price of candles
had decreased —giving the Herald’s affirmatives
direct negatives. Further, that soap, a co-product
with candles, was now sold cheaper than last
year, in spite of See’s new duty of £3 per ton. In
an editorial foot-note, the Herald repeated its
mis-statements, and the Co. attempted to convince
the Foreign-trade journal of its error by pointing
out that it was quoting the i rice of an inferior
tallow utterly unsuitable for candle-making, and
offering to allow the Company’s business records
to be unreservedly inspected by any’ Herald
representative. This letter, the Herald, it is
claimed, declined to publish.
Dear Bulletin, — That German and
damper-yarn in a recent issue reminds me of a
little back-country (Barrier) incident a few years
ago. She was a boundary rider’s wife, and a
“ tough ’un ” on travellers ; he, an old stager of a
sundowner, and perhaps an equally hard case, had
passed the hut hungry once previously, and hadn’t
forgotten the circumstance. On this occasion he
possessed half-a-crown, and threw it to the two-
year-old youngster, which was amusing itself under
the bough shed ; he slung “Matilda ” off his back,
and leant across the rail, telling the child in a
loud voice what a beautiful little dear it was. Ma
soon appeared on the scene, and, seeing the half-
crown in the little darling’s fist, invited the S.D.
to stop and have a feed. After putting away
much damper and mutton, besides pocketing a
lump of brownie, he bade adieu to the hospitable
lady — grabbed the half-crown again as he
picked up his swag, telling the child that he
“thought it had been playing with the darned
money quite long enough,” and went on his way
rejoicing. He preferred walking another 12 miles
and keeping his half - crown to accepting her
invitation to stay for the night, but it wasn’t
meanness that prompted him to annex the coin
from the youngster, who had no idea of its
value —his sole object was to take the lady down
a peg, for which he was duly rewarded at the next
hut by a leg of mutton and a spell to do a day’s
washing, Fes, Dear Bulletin, I still have that
half-a-crown in my possession.— Tas. B. Maniac;

THE BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading' Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder 1 is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
Tne Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work ; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck over so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid witli any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same lime ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassais, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the tine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at Gin-
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating*. —In our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicants, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the moat beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may bo had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

HAIMERLESS BREECH-LOADING SHOT.GOH—ONLY 2 POUNDS,
The PEERLESS HAMMERLESS GUN is our latest
offer to the Colonial public and the most marvellous
value wo have ever presented for the money.
A RAPID LOADER, CLOSE SHOOTER, HARD
HITTER, and for general utility, equal to guns cost-
ing TEN POUNDS or more. Can only be bought
direct from us, or our authorised agents. Very finely
finished, browned barrel, and walnut stock, with
steel heel-plate, perfect ejectors, and hammer-
less action, lateral breech, no awkward breaking
gear, can bo loaded instantaneously, no jamming of
cartridges, never misses or hangs fire.
These guns are, WITHOUT DOUBT, the
CHEAPEST and BEST ever sold. We have
obtained control of the market, and as the supply is
limited, request customers to order early to avoid
delay and disappointment.
In order to ensure confidence In these guns
we guarantee to refund the money after a trial
if gun proves unsatisfactory, and also to pay
return carriage ourselves.
These guns could never be sold for double the
amount, if it were not that we wish them to be a great
advertisement for us.
THOUSANDS ARE NOW IN USE IN ENGLAND.
Hammerless guns are fast displacing the old style,
for the reason that the absence of hammers is safer
offering no obstacle to catch in bush, &c., to send gun
oil accidentally, and also affording a. quicker sight,
which is very essential in snap shooting.
Specially adapted for Rabbit, Duck, Kangaroo
and Wallaby shooting.
TWELVE BORE ONLY. SINGLE BARREL ONLY.
The cheapest bt ccchloader sold heretofore was at
least double the price of this gun, and we say
positively, much inferior.
The barrel and action of the Peerless gun are of
European manulacture and have formerly been rifle
barrels, and of quite as good quality of metal as the
most expensive gun in use, being manufactured
directly under government supervision, and only
passed alter most severe tests.
The boring and chambering have been done with
the one view of hard hitting and close shooting. So
simple and compact is the action, that we assert it to
be almost an impossibility for them to get out of order.

from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
i Averages of the English 12 (in-
cluding Phillipson) in big matches totalled a little higher
than those of the representative dozen Australians.
Taking the four highest scorers on either side, there was
a difference of 1 run per man in favour of the visitors for
each innings—a fraction less than 37 against a fraction
less man 36. The remaining eight Britishers made a
general average of about 171 runs per innings, whilst the
next eight Australians (including Moses, who batted five
tunes, and Trott, who batted ten) made 161 runs. In
bowling, the best English quartette—Attewell, Peel,
Lohmann and Briggs—come out with a general average of
15.1 runs per wicket, as against the cost of 191 runs per
wicKet incurred by Worrall, Turner, M‘Leod, and George
Giffen collectively'. Worrall, however, bowled only half as
many balls as Trott, and not a third of Callaway’s total,
the two latter making bad averages of 31 and 35. On the
other hand, Sharpe (31 per wicket) bowled more than
Briggs or Peel. But if we take six bowlers for either
country Grace (27) and Sharpe as a set off against Trott
and Callaway the Britishers have still the best of it in this
department. In the face of all these figures the double
defeat of Grace & Co. seems inexplicable, for they scored
(on an average) a trifle more runs than the leading Aus-
tralians and bowled with much better results. The
wicket in the Adelaide match goes some way towards
explaining the riddle. Lumping the three “ test"
matches together, it appears that the Englishmen
(thanks in a great measure to the rain) had
an innings and 104 runs to the good, although they - lost
the Vet it has still to be explained how the
Englishmen s batting average goes only 1 run per man
higher than their opponents, whilst their bowling, in-
cluding 22 runs made off Stoddart, cost less by' 4 runs per
wicket. An industrious mathematician may' unravel this
mystery by the light of the fact that the Englishmen lost
only 97 wickets to bowlers in eleven-a-side matches,
whereas the Australians lost 153 wickets, “llunning-
out” was all in favour of our men. The visitors lost 13
of 110 wickets that way, and the Australians threw away
their lives in 7 only out of 160 instances. The Buu.etix’B
extract of statistics will be found a useful tonic for new
chums who are suffering from depressed spirits and
collapsed cricket expectations.
* • *
The one absolute failure of Sheffield’s team was
Sharpe, with bowling and batting averages, in first-class
matches, of 30 runs per wicket and 10 runs per innings.
In both departments the young Surrey cyclops came out
at the bottom of the list. Bean, with an average of 17
runs, was another expensive error, considering that he was
about the least valuable man in the field. Comparative
failures w'ere Briggs, M‘Gregor and Attewell, as batsmen,
and Peel as a bowler. But in truth none of the old
bowlers made as good averages as they have made against
Australian elevens in England, not even after allowing
for the harder w'iekets they get to work upon at
this end. Moreover, none of them looked like bowl-
ing quite as dangerously as of yore. Many yards
of stuff have been written about the doings of Lord Shef-
field’s defeated champions, but no one seems to have
commented upon the fact that they, like several teams
before them, show'ed to less advantage in Sydney' than in
Melbourne. N.S.W. has been able to trouble the’ English-
men, again and again, for y'ears past, whereas the Vic-
torians never seem to have a chance against them. This
being thus, the fact that Victoria maintains a slight
supremacy over N.S.W. in intercolonial matches, is
another proof of the “ glorious uncertainty of cricket,”
or perhaps it goes to show that the difference between
the Sydney and Melbourne climates is against the
Britishers.

# * *
Lord Sheffield’s proposal to bring out the flower
of British cricket solely for the purpose of playing three
test-matches, appears an acknowledgement that the pre-
sent English team is inferior to the All-Australian Eleven.
With champions Gunn and Shrewsbury added, the
Britishers would put our men fairly on their mettle, and
the only suggestion we have to offer is, that the date-
fixtures be left to meteorologist Wragge.
• * #
Mrs. W. G. Grace, in returning thanks for
floral tributes aboard the Valetta, said she was glad to
know that she would soon be back again with her children
in Australia. Lord Sheffield is a good friend to the
Graces. In default of getting W.G. with the contem-
plated “three match” team, he will, apparently, invite
the family to be his guests.
• # •
It is reported that English cricketers, Grace and-
Lohmann, had a little serious mill in Adelaide, a couple
of weeks ago. Later on, Grace insulted Stoddart and was
promptly “ plugged.” An exchange of blows again took
place between the last two on the morning of embarka-
tion per Valetta for London. It is known that in Sydney
one of the Englishmen was served with a writ of £5OO for
assault—in a row at the bottom of which was a barmaid.
Lord Sheffield “squared” the writ for £9O.

consultation was held ; the principal butcher suggested
that they should subscribe the missing member’s share on
his behalf and trust to him to repay them when he got
sober, and the proposition was seconded by the gentleman
who salted the hides ; while the tallow-boiler, seconded by
the man who skimmed the grease off the refuse-tank,
urged that they should eject him from the company' and
buy 23 chances only'. The amendment was carried, and
the syndicate bought tickets numbered (say) 90,000 to
Then ticket 90,023 scooped the big prize, and the
party just missed getting about £5OO each through not
taking the other ticket. And now the 23 who were sober
say that the man who was drunk ought to be hanged for
ruining the entire speculation, and he says that they
wrecked the business themselves by their meanness and
want of ordinary horse-sense, and the butcher and the
man who salts the hides are threatening the life of the
tallow'-boiler and the man who skims the fat off the tank,
and there will be murder done before the trouble is over.

in court that when an estate agent sold property to a man
who was one of his (the agent’s) partners, and also manager
of the banking co. for whom the estate was purchased,

chairman and manager of the eo.’s board of directors,
the balance going to the members of the auctioneering

No. IV.—The Convening of “The Ring.”*
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
Captain Maconochie, who, with Major
Anderson, supplied the non-demoniac element in
the reigns of Norfolk Island Commandants, in
pursuance of his theory that the convict should be
encouraged to hope not alone for an alleviation of
his physical condition but also for “a new moral
nature,” hit upon an expedient for developing
even in hardened souls, those softening and refin-
ing tendencies which flow from a heart-felt solici-
tude for the welfare of others. By detaching
transports into groups, or “sub-gangs,” of three
or five members, and holding each man of the
three or five responsible for the good behaviour of
his comrades, an irresistible appeal was at once
made to the curiously-confused notions that
swayed the average convict mind. An argu-
ment which had regard only to their own
comfort or freedom from punishment would,
in the case of nine out of ten “old hands”
—the doubly-convicted convicts transported
from the mainland or Van Diemen’s Land—
be welcomed by an oath or a ribald jest. When
callousness in infamy was deemed to be an
honour —when irons were thought the insignia of
chivalry —and “connoisseurs in murder ” felt it a
privilege to take the hand of a “ looked-boot ”
victim —it was an insult to suggest an immunity
from penalties as a reason for right action. Take
another course, however, and appeal to the sense
of fraternity, which seldom died out even in the
“best” men, and that caution in conduct and
that eternal obedience to the regulations which a
“good ” man would never think of exerting in his
own interests, would be at once exercised for the
benefit of his group-mates. Most of Maconochie’s
attempts at penal reform sprang from his heart,
and were seldom based on a hard, logical appre-
hension of facts as they were. But, in respect to
his grouping system, his heart and his head acted
together. His judgment and his experience of
the “ old hands ’’ taught him that it was literally
and absolutely a point of honour with them
never to procure punishment for another trans-
port who manifested “spunk.” And his heart
showed him how to take advantage of this
characteristic. What “old hands” would not do
for themselves they should do for others. They
should respect regulations and official practices,
because violation of them would cause the infliction
of punishment upon their colleagues of the group.
# * #
Between the principal settlement (which was
supposed to change its name according to the sex of
the reigning sovereign, and, therefore, should
have been called Queenstown in the present reign,
but which, notwithstanding, was more often spoken
of as Kingstown than Queenstown) and the out-
lying barracks at Longridge, the Commandant
laid out, in March and April, 184—, a number of
farms of six to ten acres area each. On each farm
a hut or cottage was erected, and a company of
from three to five men was assigned to each hut
and farm. For the first year, no rental was
demanded by the Commandant. For succeeding
years each group of tenants had to contribute a
rental of twelve bushels of maize for each cleared
acre, this quota being estimated to equal one-third
of the average crop per acre raised by labour
under direct taxation. And every group was
constituted a 44 mutual responsibility ” sub-gang.
That is to say, for the misdeeds of any one
member of a group, the other members would
suffer.
The group tenanting the hut on Section 5 B was
constituted by some 4 4 old hands’’whose records
were of the very 44 best. ”+ Tested by the official
standards of the elder System, they would have
been welcomed by Lucifer with a 44 Hail, fellows,
well met! ” And thereupon the soft-hearted
Commandant resolved they should have a chance
to reform. Very much to the amusement of the
Commissariat and other officials did he announce
this determination.
The sub-gangers were five in number. Osborne,
of whom we dare say no more than that it was a
daily wonder to his comrades how he escaped
hanging; Peake, a small-skulled, thirty-year old
lump of a physical deformity that rivalled his
moral nature ; a gentlemanly ex-forger who was
popularly known as 44 Barrington ” from the
circumstance that he knew off by heart the account
of that immortal scoundrel’s career; a“Swinger”+—
Felix—less sullen than brutish in feature, and
of gigantic physical strength; and Reynell, a
former soldier of the 44 Fighting Half-Hundred,”
who had been transported to Norfolk Island by a
V.D.L. military court for desertion to Maori-
land in a whaler.
A tall, strapping fellow, who carried himself
with military erectness, was Reynell, and it was
his boast that his parchment record was as long as
himself. Of course, the assertion was a slight
exaggeration, but Reynell was given to little
whimsicalities. A devil when roused, he was, as
a rule, a merry soul, who was pleasantly cynical.
He entered into crime with the same zest
as into a battle-square. “It was but putting
the bayonet into the law instead of the enemy,”
he said to Mr. Pery, Superintendent of Agricul-
ture, one day when Pery asked him why he would
persist in settintr the authorities at defiance. “ I
have to let the devil out of me somehow', sir, and
as Her Gracious Mejesty —God bless her ! —won’t
employ me against her enemies, I have to make
enemies of my own. And the law’s a grand enemy
to fight, sir ! It’ll take such a lot of beating !”
Against a criminal of this temper the Law had
used everything in its dread armoury, except
44 the spread-eagle,” the gallows, and—a kind
word and good faith. These last two instruments
of unusual punishment Captain Maconochie now
determined to supply. He appointed Reynell
leader of 5 B sub-gang at a Sunday morning
“ after chapel ” muster at the Iron Room.
“ Henry Reynell, per Coquette, colonial trans-
port,” called the mustering-overseer,
“Reynell, how do you come to be included
among 4 old hands ’ when you’re a 4 colonial ’ ?”
questioned the Commandant, with his pleasant
resonance of voice, as soon as the man had replied
with his 44 Here !”
4 4 The honourable Court gave me 14 years, y’r
honor, and as I didn’t think it enough I got ’em
to make it life?” There was a ripple of laughter
in the ranks.
44 How ?” asked the Captain, who took no notice
of the demonstration.
44 1 struck the corporal of the court guard—and
so the honourable Court gave me what I wanted.”
44 Not the same court ? It could not act at once
and without being formally convened by the
Colonel-Commanding ?”
44 As to that, sir, I can’t say. All I know is
that same Court convicted me—and I came here
with a double sentence. Therefore, Major Ryan
thought me entitled, sir, to all the emoluments,
rights and privileges of an old hand. I’ve been in
irons all the time I’ve been here.”
44 Will you take a word of advice from me,
Reynell?” said the Commandant.
44 Will —I—what, y’r honor ?” asked Reynell,
with a choking breath in his voice that might
have been amusement, or might have been sheer
amazement at the autocrat of a penal-settle-
ment assuming so extraordinary a tone.
44 Take my advice, my good fellow, just to drop
that sneering manner of speech.” There was
a genuine kindness in the words. Reynell drew
himself up to his full height and clenched his fist.
Those who stood by thought he was about to
transform recklessness of tongue into madness of
action. The line between a murderer and a hero
is often but a hair’s breadth, and this man, who
might easily become a hero, might as easily pass
the line.
However, other answer than this he did not
make. He flung out his closed hand and said :
44 So easy to preach, y’r honor ! With the iron in
the soul, and the cat on the back, and the
bayonet-point in the body, what wonder the
sneer’s on the lip? So easy for you gentlemen to
deal with heartless numbers. You say, Numbers
37-189 —that’s me-and 39-204—that’s Felix —
don’t feel, God above —don’t we! And what
weapon ha’ we to fight the System with if you
won’t allow us to use our tongues? Even at our
peril we must use ’em !”
He stopped and gathered strength for a last
phrase which quivered with the under-thrill of his
bitterness. 44 It’s fighting that’s our last hope of
keeping something of manhood to ourselves, sir !
Fight!—l’d die if I did not fight—die or go mad !”
Outbursts of this sort were common enough
among the more intelligent convicts, but
Maconochie never ceased to be impressed by
them. The receptive sympathy of the man—
which proved his ruin as an administrator —was
always stirred when the note of strength and
sincerity ran through the transport’s utterances.
He listened now to Reynell with a patience that
to his under-strappers and to the felons at muster
seemed at once wonderful and childish.
With mutual nods and winks (in hearty enjoy-
ment of the joke) the gentlemen of the Commis-
sariat who accompanied him listened to his
ludicrously feeble reception of Convict Reynell’s
attack on the System’s amenities.
44 Reynell,” he stepping a pace nearer to
the ranks as he spoke, “ I am going to trust you—
I will give you a farm—you and any four others
you may choose to pick out of the Old Hands ! ”
“ You —are—not jollying—me, your Honour ?”
“ No—you will find by-and-bye that I never
4 jolly! ’”
“ Then, by G —, sir, I’ll be true man to you ! ’
From the rank of men from which Reynell had
been called out came in two or three distinct voices
a shout of :
“ The Ring’ll see ’bout that ! The Oath ! The
Oath! ”
» * *
Reynell, instantly flushed with the strenuous
hope that had been created by Maconochie’s
words, paled as instantly. Then :
“ I’ll take it back, y’r Honor. I’ll remain as I
am—a ‘ good ’ man !”
“That’s right, that’s right, my man !” rejoined
the Commandant, genially. Again, a sibillant
chorus from the ranks. The transports were
tickled agreeably at what they thought his mis-
apprehension. They had understood Reynell.
Reynell, they knew, was simply adopting the
vocabulary of the damned, in which “darkness
was light and light darkness.” But the laughter
stopped instantly as Maconochie raised his hand
—and did the fatalest thing of his commandancy.
“Men!” he exclaimed, “No more of that!
And now listen!”
A rubbing and clinking of irons and a shuffling
of feet rose on the calm air as the men settled
themselves into position. They had heard they
had got a “bad” preaching Commandant—and
now Fate was about to confirm the report by
currsing them with a second sermon on the one
day.
“Men, listen ! A threat has been used about
the‘Ring.’ Now, I tell you—‘Ring’ members
and non-members of the ‘Ring’—that 1 am
resolved to crush that society out of existence. ”
From among the massed men a confused clamour
arose. “So other Confidants have said—and they
failed!” “ Better not try !” “ Ye’ll ha’to croak
first! ” A chorus of defiance in which rumbled an
accent of triumph. The System for three genera-
tions of Islanders had been trying to kill the
“Ring” and the “Ring” was still immutable
and impregnable. The men who were of the
“Ring” feared its despotism, but gloried in its
traditions and its power. The men whose names
were not scored in its mysteriously-kept roll,
respected it and admired it, for was it not a rock
that withstood the shocks of the Authorities? —an
empire supreme over an empire otherwise omni-
potent ?
Now, Maconochie had meant to say that the
only uprooting force he intended to apply to the
“ Ring ” was that of kindness and justice. His
wish was to render the Secret Society innocuous
by depriving it of any occasion for the exercise of
its undoubtedly enormous capacity for desperate
action. But he was given no chance of explaining
himself. Though they thought that the loss of
their Sunday dinner—deeply cherished treat! —
was involved in the uproar, the 150 men, moved
by a common impulse of passion which, like a
tornado-wave, swept all before it, continued and
increased their clamour. They shouted, whistled,
clanked their irons. Every sound was an inflec-
tion of evil. To the officials inured by years of
familiarity with the Island life to such demonstra-
tions, there was nothing particularly alarming—
certainly nothing distressing in the storm. To the
Commandant, however, sensitive in feeling,
exalted in imagination, and subject to a curious
persistence of reasoning which convinced him
* The constitution of “The Ring,” so far as it has been
ascertained, will be described in the course of the sequel
to this story. Here it may be briefly explained that
“ The Ring," as originally organised, and till the epoch
of Major Childs—Maconochie’s successor—embraced four
“ Circles ” and a Head—the circle of “ Three ” members,
the circle of “ Five,” the circle of “ Seven,” and the circle
of “Nine,” or a total initiate membership of twenty-five.
In the slang of “The Ring”—a distinct species of the
“Flash ” language-the “Head”—in this story termed
the “ One was accorded a term awfully blasphemous.
So terrible was the fear inspired by “The Ring” that the
memory of it made old “Black Norfolkers” reticent 30
years after the society was virtually broken up by the
abandonment of the Island as a penal settlement; and no
department of the author’s researches has caused him
greater trouble, and presented him with comparatively
smaller results, than the history of this organisation.
t At Norfolk Island it was the awful custom among the
more hardened convicts to invert the meaning of “ good”
and “bad.” A “good man ” was a notorious criminal; a
“bad” one was a man who sought to act honestly and
purely.
t Transported for rickburning—a follower of “ Swing,”
the suppositions criminal who, at the period of the agri-
cultural depression of the Early Thirties, was accused bv
the peasants of setting farmers’ ricks and barns on Are.

every transport was less an offender against society
than a victim of society’s errors and stupidities,
the noise was a literal shock.
He held his band up to command silence. A
strong hiss from the centre greeted the gesture.
He folded his arms, as though to wait patiently
for the cessation of the tumult. The challenge
was responded to by shrieks of laughter.
He lifted his cap and passed his handkerchief
across his forehead. Fifty hands derisively copied
the action. It was an admission that he was
beaten, and they delighted in it as their nostrils
would have done in the scent of roast meat.
He turned his back upon men, and
motioned to a gaol-warder. Assistant-Deputy-
Commissariat. General Shanks thought he pur-
posed to order up the main-guard, and for the first
time was prepared to confess to himself that the
Commandant was something more than a dreamer.
And —Mr. Shanks was to be disappointed.
Instead of bringing up at the “double ” a file of
twelve men—instead of issuing in bloody sequence,
incisive commands : “Ready! Present! Fire!”
Captain Maconochie had sent to his own stores
for, —tobacco ! The imbecility of that act! —how
it startled Mr. Shanks! How it spoilt his
Sunday’s dinner and compelled him to sacrifice
his afternoon nap so that he might write to
Governor Gipps and Mr. E. Deas-Thomson !
“ Tobacco for rebels ! The establishment is
going to the devil!” he groaned later to Mrs.
Shanks. “ Tobacco ! —when they should have had
lead. If he had made requisition upon me, and
not have drawn from his own store, I’d have
refused there and then !” For Mr. Shanks’ heart
was sore within him.
As for the gentry of the Iron Room, their
turbulence held till the box of tobacco was placed
at the Commandant’s feet. And then it faded,
with a final hiss and splatter as a breaking wave
dies against the shingle. They were stupefied at
this unique form of punishment.
“ ’E’s a-goin’ to ’cap coals o’ fire on our ’eads !”
exclaimed someone, but the remark passed un-
heeded. The mass were too surprised even for
ribald comments.
* # *
“Reynell !” Maconochie called.
Reynell looked round before answering. Did
the “ Ring ” raise objection ? If it did, there was
no visible or audible sign of its refusal. And he
stepped forward ; and, to the Commandant’s
pleasure, saluted.
“ Reynell, call out four men to assist you !”
“ What for, sir?”
“To distribute that tobacco—half a fig to a
man.”
Reynell stared at the Captain—then gazed back
at the massed men. For guidance—for a hint as
to whether he dare take the bribe on their behalf ?
Most likely so. And so near is weak kindness to
refined cruelty, there was notone man there in those
ranks of ironed, yellow, brown-and-grey garbed
felons, with the symbols of shame on their bodies
and the glare of the human beast in their eyes,
but hated Maconochie in that moment of ordeal.
Not a man there but would have risked severe
penalties to obtain a fraction of a fig; scarcely a
score of the one hundred and fifty but what had
already gone through the mire of humiliation fora
“ bit.” Therefore their hearts beat with a venom-
ous strength—because he tempted them sorely.
For why did they not answer to Reynell’s un-
spoken enquiry ?
Those who were not of the “ Ring ” dare not
speak. In collective action the “Ring” led the
“ private ” convicts.
And those who were of the Society grew weak
with the temptation. But then—to accept it, was
to acknowledge Maconochie’s supremacy, and to
confess a defeat.
For half a minute the two parties stood silent.
The surf, half a mile away, drove its monotone
over the still air. From the wooded sides of
Mount Pitt, on the other hand, travelled, not un-
melodiously, the screech of parrots. A wedge-
tailed eagle poised majestically over the square,
and hoarsely flung a taunt to the imprisoned
creatures. Save for these sounds, the parade was
as silent as is the lull before the revolt of thunder
against its confines.'
Then —first one sharp “No!”—next, two or
three were joined in the repetition—and finally, in
impetuous volume, the fierce negatives rolled from
the ranks. Never did monk of the desert make so
great a renunciation! In that volleyed mono-
syllable those outcasts of civilisation refused a
pleasure for which, under other circumstances,
they would have gleefully bartered their souls.
“No!” A brazen, defiant “No!” which
epitomised the curses of Tophet.
Reynell marched back to his place; and
Maconochie knew, as the storm of curses and
cheers burst out again, that the “Ring’’was
triumphant.
# # *
Unless
Commissariat-Officer Shanks suggested, with a
semi-sneer, the application of old methods.
“Try, Captain Maconochie, a platoon! There’s
pretty considerable of a quietening influence in a
volley, sir I That is mutiny, and if you don’t get
the better of them now, they’ll have every iron
off their ankles in an hour, and then you’ll have
to shoot the lot, unless you want us all killed.”
“ No !” replied the Commandant. “Ball-cart-
ridge is the last thing I propose to use on society’s
wrecks. Mr. Gaoler— this thing has gone far
enough. Finish the muster and give ’em their
dinners!”
“ What, sir ! Their dinners !” Really, the
gaoler was to be excused for his patent astonish-
ment.
“ Ay,—the poor fellows shan’t suffer for my
blunder in tactics. The mistake was mine—l’ve
taken ’em the wrong way to-day.”
And with this remark, so subversive of all the
conventions and principles of the System, for
whenever before did a penal commandant admit
he was in error, Captain Maconochie touched
his cap, in graceful acknowledgment of the salute
of his subordinates and left the muster-yard,
# • *
The whole of the Iron Room transports
enjoyed their dinners the more for the sauce of
triumph. For dessert they were gratified by
another delicious morsel.
The Commandant sent an order to the Gaoler
to despatch by G. 30 a.m. on Monday Henry Rey-
nell, per Coquette (Colonial), and “four other
men that the said prisoner should nominate,” to
Farm 5 8., therein to be installed as “sub-gang in
charge.” The proceeding was, it is needless to
say, altogether exceptional. But then the Island
owned an altogether exceptional commander, and
it had proved a day of exceptional occurrences.
And it was, doubtless, in accordance with the
spirit of the joke that the Gaoler, as he communi-
cated the decision to Reynell, mocked him by
doffing his cabbage-tree, and addressed him with a
scoffing irony.
“Would it please Mr. Reynell to nominate
the gentlemen who were to accompany him ?”
Reynell took the jest admirably. He craved
five minutes to make his selection, and within
that time had informed the officer that Osborne,
Peake, Barrington, and “Swinger” Felix would
form his comradeship. For the committee of the
“Ring” had raised no objection. “’Twarn’t
going out to the farmsteads, Reynell,” said a high
ruler of the league—a Three —“that we complain
of, but your promise to be a true man ! No chap
in the fellowship shall go ‘ bad ’ without permis-
sion. It’s breaking oath !”
And consent being thus obtained—we translate
the “flash” language habitually employed in
“Ring” business—the choice was, as we have
said, made and 5 B group constituted.
On Monday, when the dormitories turned out
at 5.30, the first thing done by the new sub-gang
was to present themselves at the “ blacksmith’s
shop ” and have the rivets driven from the bazils.
Felix was last at the low anvil. As the bazil of
his left leg fell to the ground he expanded the
massive brawniness of his chest with long draughts
of tonic morning air ; and then clutched Reynell
with a wrestler’s grasp.
“Why, lad, I be tha’ man for ever an’ a day.
I never ’ud ha’ got rid o’ them damned clinks but
for thee until the day I wed the worms. Bill
Felix is tha’ man for ever an’ a day !”
And now let us gather up the links of the
story.
Monday was formal court-day, and, therefore,
none of the group siw the Commandant till the
evening. Muster had passed over —the mutual
responsibility farms were mustered only by their
leader, he answering for his group—and the men
were busy preparing their “tea,” and rejoicing
in the novel sensation of was virtual free-
dom, when the Captain walked up to the hub.
They ceased their preparations and saluted.
The spontaneity of the movement was plain, and
it thrilled the “old man’s” heart to notice it.
Something, he thought, of that voluntary respect
for just authority, which is an accompaniment of
manhood, had been generated in the men by that
one day’s liberty, and surely his experiment was
about to be justified ? He smiled gaily as he re-
turned the salute.
“Now, men,” he said, “don’t mind me! Get
on with your tea —I am sure you must need it
after all this day in the fields ! ”
In forty years of the System never had Osborne
heard the like. Ho bent his eyes to the block of
stone which did duty as a temperary table, and
fumbled with his tin maize-meal dish. The
others, with the exception of Peake, were also
affected; Reynell to the point of turning his head
away so that neither the Captain nor his group-
mates should discern the tear that scalded his
cheek.
“■Men!” continued the Commandant —ever
deeper touched by evidences of gratitude than by
testimonies of insult, “I wish you would trust
me ! I want to be a friend to you—-to every man
of the 1000 souls in prison here I Come, sirs, forget
I’m the Commandant—the ‘old man.’ Think of
me, for the time being at all events, as a man—
one who deeply sympathises with your sufferings
and who will only be too glad to alleviate them in
every way he can without violating his duty to
those who sent him here! Come, what do you
say ?”
Peake was the first to speak. “Reynell, y’r
Honour, is our leader !” A dogged resistance to
any softening influence was easily to be under-
stood from his manner.
“Then, Reynell,-speak for yourself at least —for
the others if you can.”
The e.vsoldier drew his under-lip in, and bit it
till blood came, in the severity of the struggl a
between the Past and the Future that might be
Then he gulped rather than uttered his answer. ’
“I take back—the insult—of - yesterday sir
I’ll be true man to you—so help me God ! ’And
the ‘ Ring ’ may do its worst.”
Maconochie knew that, come what might-
disdain from Privy Councillors and Secretaries of
State, cold water from Governors, and sneers and
insubordination from smaller officials—yet still he
had plucked one soul from the pit. After a few
more words of friendly tenor he returned to
Government House.

Upon his going, Peake dropped his thin
mask of hypocrisy and looked what he was— the
child of the devil his father, and the System his
mother. Other parentage had he known none
When, as a hunchbacked boy of eight, he first
understood a little of the meaning of life, the
System was already nourishing him at her breasts.
And because of this must we excuse him some-
what.
Peake, when the Captain’s steps could not be
longer heard, pulled off his waist-strap.
“Hold!” He threw out an end to “Penman
Barrington. ” • ‘ Barrington ” paled—but grasped
the leather.
“ Reynell, you sneakin’ cull —come here !”
And Reynell, too, obeyed the strange command.
He took the other end. The strap was pulled
taut. Then Osborne and Felix each laid hold
upon it in the centre, standing on either side of
it. The four thus formed a cross. Sometimes in
the cross of the “Ring,” the hands touched and
clasped ; but never in the cross of denunciation.
As this was.
Three—five-seven times Peake walked round
the group ; and as he moved he recited the
Convict Oath.
At last, he stopped suddenly—at the end of the
third repetition.
“ Osborne, you’re a ‘Sevener ?’ ”
Osborne, hoarse with suppressed fear, muttered
“Yes.”
“ And you’re a Sevener, accused?” Reynell
was thus addressed. He nodded assent.
“ What are you, Bill?”
“ A Kiner !” answered Felix.
“ Barrington ?”
“ A Fiver !”
“ And I’m a Three. We’re all denominations.
All denominations necessary to convene when it’s
a Sevener as is to go up before . Do any
object?”
Silence. Only Reynell shuddered.
‘‘Then, the Niner shall bid the Niners, and
the Sevener the Seveners, and the Fiver the
Fivers, and the Three the Threes to “Ring” lodge
on Sabbath next if the One ratifies, and the busi-
ness shall be to try Sevener Henry Reynell, for
that he played our noble society false, and pro-
mised to be true man to an Establishment officer
and defies the society ! So the Devil help you
all!”
And some trembling lips muttered alow “So
the Devil help us !”
# * #
This was the manner of convening the
“Ring.” And the account of the “Ring’s”
session to try Reynell, per Coquette, we must tell
you another time.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Now my mate and myself we were low
In the funds, and were racing for lucre,
And the Crow was the best of our two,
But we knew
That the coin of the public would go
On to him, so we “ played for a euchre.”
We fixed that the mare was to win,
And, of course, we should back her like water,
At the last we’d get twenties to one;
’Twould be fun,
When the public had piled all their tin
On the Crow, just like lambs for the slaughter.
So I left all the bets to my mate,
While I went off to see to the rider,
And I heard the “ books ” calling the odds,
And, ye gods,
The mare was made favourite straight,
And the Crow was the rankest outsider.
I can tell you it puzzled me much,
As I walked on the lawn, after dinner,
For how came the public to know
That the Crow
Was to run just as stiff as a crutch
While the little bay mare was a spinner ?
Till a party came by and he told
What was up, after backing and filling,
“Your mate’s thrown you over,” said he,
“ And you’ll see,
When the mare wins her race you’ll be sold,
And you won’t get as much as a shilling.”
So I ordered the boy on the Crow,
He must win or I’d give him a hiding,
I backed him for all I could get,
And, you bet,
That my mate and his crowd felt a blow
When they saw how the youngster was riding.
For the cheers and the shouting were loud
When our pair reached the turn, racing level,
But the Crow came away in the straight,
And my mate
Came to me with a blustering crowd,
And I told him to go to the devil.
And the fight that ensued after that,
Well, it proved to those jokers so clever,
That the man whom they thought was a mug
As a“pug”
Was the clwilpion of old Lambing Flat,
And the best of his weight on the River.
And racing, folks think, ought to be
For encouraging nags that are gallant,
But they’re nowadays soon disabused,
For it’s used
For maintaining of jokers like me,
Who subscribes myself,
ONE OF THE TALENT.
In Morocco, the Moor found drunk by the
police is simply chained up to a wall until he gets
sober. Good idea to chain up “ drunks” publicly.
The Emperor of Austria would not allow
Rosalie Schneider, the murderess, to be executed.

she can also get along without executing men]
This sort of thrilling statement in Sydney
Echo is a conspicuous evidence of the advantages
of having a classical (or encyclopaedic) education :
Among the most noticeable of the necrologies com-
memorated to-day is that of the Emperor Marcus Aureliu B
Antonins, who died at Sirmium, a.d. 180. Ilis“Medita"
lions” reveal a mind of extraordinary serenity and nobility-
Is— is he dead ?
Apropos Walter Bradley's now historic
dictum that “a successful auctioneer must drink.”
One of Sydney’s most successful auctioneers is
almost a total abstainer, but he “gets there all
the same ” —by arranging at hotels to be supplied
out of whisky-bottles containing 95 per cent,
water. By the time lie re-waters his grog it is as
weak as a speck of a “high” homoeopathic
trituration in a ship’s tank.
Queen Victoria lately presented an ele-
phant, as a special mark of esteem, to her royal
friend, the Sultan of Morocco. The Sultan is
fond of that elephant, and uses it instead of a
hangman. Nearly every day he has some two or
three criminals brought, before him, and laid flat
on the ground, and then the elephant gently sits
down on each one in succession, and there is a
squashy sound which answers, in that primitive
laud, instead of a certificate of death. When the
proceedings are over the bloodstains are washed
off the back part of the animal with a hose,
and Queen Victoria’s present is stowed away for
future service.
Writes a Tasmanian correspondent: —
Dear Bulletin, “General” Booth’s colonisation
scheme is being forestalled, at least so far as Tasmania is
concerned. A month ago a batch of 30 immigrants were
landed at Davenport, on the N.W. coast, were given
grants of land by the Government, and started extensive
saw-milling works. Not satisfied with this, they procured
a vessel and, after exploring Bass’ Straits, they visited
King’s Island, and returning to Tasmania were imme-
diately granted 10,000 acres of land. This means that a
splendid piece of timber-country, and valuable timber at
that, is to be entirely under the control of the immigrants
(who, it may be mentioned, do not employ outside
labour, and imported every article they required, even to
a saucepan), while hundreds of necessitous families are to
be seen on all sides. It will be said that the Tasmanians
should have taken up the land first, but they did not
know a word about it being free. There are living on
King’s Island (farming and timber-cutting) 300 or 400
families, but the land must be given up to the English
immigrants because they are “enterprising,” at least
that is the excuse put forward.— C. A. Lake.
Sometime since a map-publisher in one of
the Australias, received from the Education
Department a lot of maps of the World to be
mounted on cloth. He handed them over to one
of his men, an American, who in cutting up the
calico made the pieces too small. To get out of
the difficulty the Yank sliced a strip out of the
middle of each map, cutting out the British Isles,
Portugal, and a considerable portion of the
Atlantic. When the map publisher saw the
result he was flabbergasted. “ Good Heavens,
man” he said to the Yank “what have you done?”
“What have I done?” said the American coolly,
“ why I cut the calico too small, so I sliced a piece
out of the middle of the maps—you see I’ve only
cut out England and a few other little places
like that!” [lnteresting lie. — Ed. B.]

Kauri-gum digging is a staple industry in
the Auckland district (M.L.). From 7000 to 10,000
men are employed, and the export frequently
reaches ,£500,000 worth annually. The gum is
worth about £40 “at the stump,” that is in the
bush, but on reaching the store it is sorted into
about 20 different qualities, ranging from “ scrap-
ings ” worth £7 a ton (used in the manufacture of
fire-kindlers), up to “firsts,” worth £200 a ton.
The equipment of the digger is a long iron spear
and a spade. The ground in an old kauri forest
is prodded with the spear, and when a hard sub-
stance is struck the spade is brought into inquisi-
tion. The experienced digger has “the pull”
over the new-chum in the spearing business. He
can tell by tasting the point of his spear if he has
touched gum, whereas the novice may dig for a
couple of hours and find but a root or a
stone as the result of his quest. The gum is found
in small patches ranging from a few pounds up
to a couple of ewt. There is reason to believe
that most of the “ copal ” varnish now used
throughout the world is manufactured from
Maoriland kauri-gum. Gum-digging is the refuge
of the indigent of every class.
The British pioneer settlers in Yokohama
had their modesty shocked by finding that male
and female Japs, bathed together without any
water costumes. Their protests worried the poor
Jans., who were anxious to please. After a hard
“ think,” a genius was struck by an inspiration
which was at once adopted. The Japs, divided
their bathing-places into two compartments, and
set one apart for males and the other for females.
The division was effected by stretching a rope
lengthwise, the centre above the water. Then
they called the British in to come and rejoice with
them about their moral x-eformation.

The writer of “Fugitive Notes” in the
S.M. Herald attempts to refute the vegetarians’
assertion that the Jews, as a carnivorous race,
were cruel, but “A. B. C.” cannot have studied
his Old Testament with much profit if it is Ins
honest belief that the Chosen People were not as
cruel as they were aggressive and bloodthirsty.
Let him read their undoubtedly authentic history
after the exodus, of their unprovoked invasions,
their slayings, burnings, and the peculiar trophies
of victory which they selected. Let him read Ins
Gibbon, and find how they behaved in Caesarea
under the then gentle sway of the Romans. Th e
Egyptians were a humane and moral people by
comparison, and when they sought, like the Czar’
to deal with what was to them a Chinese Question'
they merely pursued a policy of repression, it
might pay the S.M.H. to reproduce the Bible in
serial form. We fear, however, that Editor
Curnow would mar its pristine terseness, and
darken understanding. He would describe Mrs.
Rahab, for instance, as “a person well known to
the Jericho police,” Judah as an evidently
respectable and high-minded gentleman who was
alleged ” to have “ misbehaved himself in Meso-
potamia Park,” and Absalom’s singular perform-
ance on the roof in sight of all Israel as “the un-
fettered impulse of a self-willed mind breaking
through the tyrannous bonds of conventionality.”
Padding like this would only enable the rising
generation to get as far as the Captivity, es-
pecially if tho Rbv. Editor handed the battle
pieces to the military importer and the horsey
incidents about Jehu and Ahab to the unre-
generate Rowley Pickering.

A British pauper s funeral was in progress
the other day at Droxford (Eng.). The deceased
was being shoved along in a species of hand-cart
with his wife and daughters, and his friends— if
he had any—walking behind. When the proces-
sion was about halfway to the cemetery, the
coffin, being a slop-made article supplied by the
parish, went to pieces, and the dead man rolled
out into the road. The only thing he had on was
a pair of socks. His unexpected appearance
caused a good deal of excitement, but the parish
authorities hurriedly put him back on the cart
and nailed the broken coffin together again, and
the procession went on its way.
“WHY HE NEVER LOOKED BEHIND
KIM ”
“ After this I never looked behind me.”
This is a very common expression. What do
people mean by it ? Lot’s wife looked behind her
and was changed into a pillar of salt. A locomo-
tive driver in America looked behind him one day
last summer and so didn’t see an open drawback
in front of him. Hence a wreck and great loss of
life. A man in London failed to look behind him
and was run down by a hansom. What shall wc
do as a rule ? Look behind us or not ?
We introduce a man who says he never looked
behind him—after a certain time. How are we la
take his meaning ? Why, by letting him explain
it.
He goes on to say that in one day in February
1890, he was suddenly seized with dizziness ami
pain in his head. Like all healthy people, under
similar circumstances, he didn’t know what tu
make of it. He says he felt strange and queer he
shivered as though the weather had suddenly
turned cold, and then flushed with the heat a:;
though it had turned hot again. What ailed him;
His doctor said he was attacked with influenza
and ordered him to bed. He went to bed. A few
days later the fever left him, but the illness did
not. it merely assumed another form. Ri s
tongue looked like a piece of brown leather, and
his skin and the whites of his eyes became yellow
like old parchment. Wo must all eat to live, but
when this man tried to eat, the food went against
him, and after he had swallowed it by main force
it caused such pain in the chest, aide, and stomach
that he wished ho had let it alone. Then his
heart began to palpitate, and ho says he felt low,
languid, and tired. He had what he calls a sink-
ing feeling at the pit of the stomach and a
craving which nothing satisfied.
Being unable to take any but liquid food he
grew so weak that he was barely able to walk.
Then his heart troubled him once more, and, to
quote his own words, “ As I sat in my chair 1
could hear my heart thumping as if somebody was
pounding me on the back.”
This showed that the heart had too much work
on hand and was struggling under it like a horse
trying to carry two men. “ I got very little sleep
at night,” he says, “and would lie awake for
hours tossing about on the bed.” This sort of
thing is very wearing, and we are not surprised to
learn that he lost flesh until little was left of him
but skin and bone. “My cheeks,” he says, “sank
in until they were almost drawn together, and
people shook their heads and predicted that my
time in this world was nearly up. Still I had all
confidence in my physician and kept on taking his
medicine. From first to last I took some forty or
fifty bottles of it (of all kinds) without benefit.
“Finally one day the doctor sounded my lungs
and asked me if any of our family died of con-
sumption. He said that the heart palpitation was
caused by dyspepsia. Then he said I had better
take further advice; he could do no more for me.
This was after nine months of his treatment. I
gave up all hopes of getting better, and, indeed,
no one expected me to.
“It was now winter again, December, 1890,
One day I found a little book or pamphlet in the
house, that I had never seen before. It was about
a medicine called Mother Seigel’s Syrup, and
described a case like mine having been cured by it.
Without going into all my hopes and fears on the
point, it is enough to say that I got a bottle from
Mr. Kirkmarx, Chemist, Ellerby Lane. I took the
contents of that bottle and certainly felt a little
better. I took a second and began to eat solid
food, which agreed with me. ||||
“ After this 1 never looked behind me, though
my recovery was a work of time, for I was very
much reduced. I stuck to the medicine, and with
good reason, and at last got back to my work,
strong and well, and have remained so ever since.
When I went back to the works the foreman and
others gathered round me and asked what had
wrought the wonderful change. I answered,
“Mother Seigel’s Syrup had wrought it.” When
I said I wished to start work they told me I must
first be examined by a doctor. The doctor said 1
was fit for work and I went to work the next
morning and have never lost a minute since.
“ I wish others to know what Seigel’s Syrup has
done for me, and I give the proprietors permission
to publish this brief account of my case. I am a
cloth presser by trade and have worked at Messrs.
Hepworth and Sons, Clay Pit Lane, for four
years.” Harvey Askew, 2 Back Timber Place,
Ellerby Lane, Leeds.
The doctor was right in saying that the apparom
heart trouble in Mr. Askew’s case arose from
dyspepsia, for dyspepsia was his only ailment.
And if he had used Mother Seigel’s Syrup m
February, 1890, he would have had no tale to tell,
for he would have been all right directly. Asi
is we are glad that after he did try it he had no
relapse. He never looked behind him.
