The RED PAGE
The Making of Poetry
The lunatic, the lover and the poet have
generally been bracketed in the public mind
as well as in Shakespeare’s phrase, and
G, E. Woodberry, an American literary
critic, has some interesting things to say
about the poetic frenzy in The Inspiration
of Poetry (Macmillan).
The first radical trait of poetry is the presence
of emotion, and this to so marked a degree that it
is characteristically described as madness.
This emotion is shared with the community.
In primitive conditions it found a vent in
Dionysiac frenzy, Bacchic revelry, the abori-
ginals’ corroboree. Civilisation brought it
into narrow channels, and restrained its
violence. Nietzsche divided the realm of
poetry between Dionysus, from whom came
the intoxication, and Apollo, who looked
after the form.
In the great songs of the French Revolution
the Dionysiac quality, the presence of the mad
throng, the singing horde, had its last great
literary illustration ; but wherever a poet sings
the causes of mankind, there is this fanatical
blending of his own soul with the idea.
To make poetry, this emotion, which is
fundamentally rhythmical, is controlled and
expressed harmoniously.
“ Great literatures arise along the lines of
fracture in human progress.” The new poet ia
necessarily the exponent of emotion in new
fields or turned towards new objects—-“he
is an experimenter, as it were, in life.” In
advance of his time, he has always been a
lonely figure, has suffered and gone hungry,
and has often died in poverty and neglect.
Woodberry takes Marlow r e as a type of
naked genius, the poet of immense energy
who “ did not so much create great works as
he rather originated the art itself by which
great works should in their time be accom-
plished.” Then Camoens, “ filled with poets’
blood as the pure grape with wine.”
He was wild and free, amorous, framed for en-
joyment, southern-hearted, a boon comrade, a
tender friend ; betweeYi the prison and the camp
and the ship’s deck he had a soldier’s gaiety, waa
fond of fine apparel and ofj golden suppers—the
adventurers changeful fortune ; but failure was all
he found in the East, and the profound discourage-
ment of his lot invaded his heart at last.
Byron, Tasso and Lucretius are also treated
as possessors of poetic energy in a high de-
gree: and Gray as an example of- the poetic
temperament without a trace of madness.
A final CHisay on Inspiration enforces the
point that men are great in soul in proportion
as they are poets.
Chatterton
There are few more remarkable cases of
poetic energy breaking out in advance of its
time than that of Thomas Chatterton, “ the
sleepless soul that perished in its pride ” at
the age of 18. The scanty facts of his brief
career have been printed many times, and
J. H. Ingram comes forward with a large
volume called The True Chatterton, a Nevi
Study from Original Documents (Unwin), in
which he seeks to correct the mistakes of his
predecessors.
The new material printed by Ingram is of
little value; but he does shed some new
light on the relations between Chatterton
and his Bristol acquaintances, and he heaves
another brick at Horace Walpole for his
scurvy treatment of the boy. Ingram doubts
the genuineness of the account said by
Walpole to have been endorsed by Chatter-
ton on the MS. of “ A Letter to Lord Mayor
Beckford ”:
Accepted by Bingley, set for and thrown out of
the North Briton , June 21st, on account of the
Lord Mayor’s death.
Lost by his death on this essay £1 11 6
Gained in elpgies £2 2 0
do. essays ... ... 3 3 0
Am glad he is dead by £3 13 6
This was no doubt written in the same spirit
as the famous “ Last Will and Testament,’4n
which he declared his intention of commit-
ting suicide, and left
all mv fire and vigor of youth to Mr. Geo. Cat-
cott, being sensible that he is most in want of
it... unto the Rev. Mr. Camplin, sen., all my
humility ; to Mr. Burgum all my prosody and
grammar. .. my powers of utterance I give to the
Rev. Mr. Broughton, hoping he will employ
them to a better purpose than reading lectures on
the immortality of the soul 1 give and be-
queath to Mr. Matthew Mease a rhourning ring
with this jnotto, “Alas, poor Chatterton ! ” pro-
vided he pays for it himself. ...
and much more to the same effect.
As a collection of facts, photographs and
fac-simiies Ingram’s book has some value.
The title, however, is an impertinence. There
is as much conjecture as in most of the
biographies, and it is not so sympathetic a
portrait of “the marvellous boy” as David
Masson’s, whose monograph is ignored by
Ingram. Anyone wishing to study Chatter-
ton will get all the necessary materials in
Masson’s book and the Aldine edition of the
Poems.
Norman Carter
Norman Carter’s work in portraiture has
brought him rapidly into the front rank of
Australian artists. His first big picture—
“ The ’Cello Player,” a portrait in oils of his
brother—was exhibited in Sydney in 1905.
At the last Show of the Art Society of
N.S.W. his full length figure study, “A
Low-toned Harmony,” was one of the four
or five good things there. All his work
bears evidence of sincerity and painstaking
energy.
[“A Low-toned .Harmony” was not pur-
chased by the National Gallery. The fact
may be unfortunate for Carter, but it has no
bearing on the question of the artistic value
of the picture. If the Gallery trustees,, were
men of fine taste, their purchase of a local
artist’s work would be equivalent to a
diploma of merit. At present it means to
the artist only the cash and the advertise-
ment ; his reputation is made or unmade
outside.}
Photo, by Appleby.
Carter was born at Kew, near Melbourne,
somewhere in the ’7o’s. As a small boy he
started on the bread-winning track in the
employ of a firm of decorators in. the city.
He was afterwards apprenticed for three
years to a stained-glass designer, and spent
most of his evenings in the study of drawing
at the National Gallery classes. Then he
was art salesman for a time, clerk ip a grain
merchant’s office for a shorter time, and
came to Sydney on the lookout for some-
thing better. Three months afterwards he
was given an opportunity to go back and
devote himself wholly to study in Mel-
bourne.
It was in 1898 that his studentship began
in earnest at the classes conducted by Bern-
ard Hall and F. McCubbin. He worked
there day and night until the desire came
upon him to go out and see what he
could do with the bush. He rented
a two-roomed cottage, near Kew, at half
a crown a week, and for over a year
painted in the open air for all he was worth.
It proved that the attraction of the figure
was stronger than landscape, and he went
back to town for further study under Phillips
Fox, and at the Gallery life class in the even-
ings. Meanwhile he had to live on a slender
income, part of which was derived from teach-
ing. It was a strenuous life.; but the reward
came after his removal to Sydney, seven
years ago.
When he married, confidence in his future
was his main asset. Carter found enough to
do in trade designing and newspaper illus-
tration to keep him going until commissions
came in for portraits. The public man likes
. to be “ done in oil ” for the edification of pos-
terity. There are a few private persons in
Australia with money to burn, and some of
them are getting into the way of starting
family portrait galleries. This is proving
profitable to Norman Carter and one or two
other artists, and as their prices are still low
the investment is a good one for the afore-
said families. “ The ’Cello Player gave
the public a taste of his quality, and since
then he has painted Prof. Pitt Cobbett,
Allen Taylor in mayoral robes, Lord Chelms-
ford, Joseph Carruthers, and William Sand-
ford, the iron-man of Lithgow. In the last-
mentioned he had a “ subject” which suited
him well, and the picture, which hangs in
the Sydney Gallery, is a striking success.
Carter has plenty of work now and gets
good prices. He is engaged in a full-length
portrait of Judge Cohen; commissions are
coming in freely for black-and-white work,
and he was recently appointed instructor of
the Art Society’s class. _. •
Like most Australians, Carter would like
to take a trip to Europe. He thinks it is
advisable for every artist to go as soon as he
can ; but the artist in Australia who does
not go is not at so great a disadvantage as
his predecessor of 20 years ago, because
it is now possible to get a good idea of
the best work of European artists in
excellent reproductions. “If a man is in
earnest and works hard he can develop freely
in Australia,” says Carter. “Some of our
men who have gone abroad have held their
own ; others have lost their individuality.
What I should think is lacking here is that
encouraging atmosphere which surrounds a
large number of men working together with
high aims. But that will come. Consider-
ing our small population, Australians have
given a fair amount of encouragement to
their own artists. After all, most depends
upon the artist himself.”
The Color Line
I William Archer, who is well known as a
dramatic critic and early champion of Ibsen,
visited the United States last year, and
found himself so much in disagreement with
the published opinions of his friend, H. G.
Wells, on the race question that he had to
write a book about it —Through Afro-
Arm- rka, (Sydney Book Club).
W ells’s sentiments of brotherhood and de-
mocracy were outraged by the Southern
discrimination against the blacks and the
prevalence of lynch law. But he talked about
the hysteria of the whites from a knowledge
of the Northern States only. There are
only a million blacks in the Northern and
Western States, employed mostly as ser-
vants, and there is no friction there. Archer
went down into the Black Belt, to New
Orleans and Florida, and afterwards to
Cuba and Panama. He found that there
was a very mil and pressing problem in the
17 Southern States, where the blacks num-
ber nine millions. In some cases whites and
blacks are occupying the same territory in
something like equal numbers. The tension
increases in direct ratio of the number of
negroes.
It seems a huge irorty that a Republic
based on the principle of human equality
and professing Christianity should be the
country of lynchings, Jim Crow cars, and
churches in which blacks are not admitted;
Archer goes to the heart of the matter
when he points out that theory is of no
avail against rooted instinct.
It may Im a great pity that nature implanted
race instincts deep in our breasts —nature has
done so many thoughtless things in her day. But
there they are, not to be ignored or sentimental-
ised away. . . . They (the blacks and whites) are
essentially, irreconcilably different, and instincts
rooted, through untold centuries lead the whito
man to associate ugliness and a certain tinge of
animalism in the negro physiognomy and phy-
sique. •
During the Civil War the Slaves were
trusted by their white masters, who left
women und children in their charge when
they went off \,o fight. There were no out-
rages nor risings. Then came the period of
Reconstruction. The whites who had taken
arms against the Republic were deprived of
civic rights ; the blacks were enfranchised.
The new wine of political power burst sdme
of the old bottles ; negroes rode roughshod
over “ the white trash,” and the whites re-
taliated with bullets. Barred from social
equality, the latent animalism of the black
broke out in unspeakable outrages, and the
whites replied with equally barbaric, lynch-
ings. The fear of outrage is still constant
amongst the whites in Louisiana. The im-
pulse to lynch is strong, though lynching lias
proved as ineffectual in practice as it is un-
justifiable in theory.
Crimes against women and all sorts of negro
crime will be far more effectively checked when
respectable and well-disposed negroes can feel
reasonably confident that people of their race will
be treated with common fairness in white,
courts of law. At present it is certain that they
can feel no such confidence. . . . By treating him
with consistent and systematic injustice, the
South is weakening and confusing its own case
against the negro.
Negroes are loyal, docile, and instinctively
religious. Any sort of religion does them.
“ We are,” said one of them to Archer,
“Methodists among Methodists, Presby-
terians among Presbyterians, and so on.”
Their standard of morality is low.
Archer finds no evidence of superiority in
the mulatto over the pure negro. The black
child will often learn by rote quicker than
the white'child, but in anything that requires
understanding the negro soon falls behind.
Their imitation of European methods of
living generally, results in caricature , their
acquired refinement is at best a thin veneer.
The heights to which the negro can rise
are shown in the case of Booker Washington,
a pure-bred negro, an organiser, a teacher,
and a speaker of great eloquence. Archer
visited his college at Tuskegee, and other
negro schools; but, in bis opinion, education
of the inferior race will not solve the race
problem. Every other relation might be
adjusted in time but that of sex ; and there
is no prospect of fusion. The whites would
have everything to lose. The fixed antipathy
of the South to the very idea of such a thing
may be fanatical, but it is based on solid
reason. The only remedy that suggested
itself to Archer is segregation within the
Republic.
The case for the negro as a political factor
is stated by Prof. Kelly Miller in the
August Nineteenth Century ; but he does
not affect Archer’s contention that race
prejudice cannot be argued out of existence,
and if things are allowed to drift, the present
state of inter-racial irritation is sure to bring
trouble.

William Watson’s latest volume—Me
and Purple , with other Poems (Dymocks)
adds to the tributes to Edward VII. a stately
and sonorous piece of rhetoric, with lines as
carefully chiselled as those on a royal
tombstone :
Honor the happy dead with sober praise,
Who living would have scorned the fulsome
phrase,
Meet for the languorous Orient s jewelled ear.
That’s nearly as good as Tennyson. -
And, unappalled by his majestic fate.
Pretended not to greatness, yet was great.
That’s clever, but not true. It would be
fine if applied to a man like Abe Lincoln.
'King Alfred, who has been a long time
dead, has some talk with Asser the Welsh-
man, which may have a dark meaning for
somebody on the seats of the mighty, but
has little value as verse.
The best poem in the little book is “ In
the Midst of the Seas,” apportion of which
was quoted here some time ago. This,
addressed to his wife, is personal and vigor-
ous. He put off his pontifical robes and
Tennysonian diction, forgot the laureateship
he didn’t get, and wrote as William Watson.
And plain W.W. is very fine at times.
Harry A. Franck’s A Vagabond Jowmey
Around the World (Angus and Robertson) is
different to the ordinary travel' book. Any
man who got from place to place with the
money he earned on the way might have had
as many adventures, but few could have set
them down in print so vividly. Franck is
a cheerful vagabond, who was not soured by
trouble like S. P. Hyatt. He is an observer
who has found human nature an unending
source of interest., His book is full of good
things—a bright and lively story of many
countries and people.
There is some good American fighting in
Ilopalong Cassidy, by C. E. Mulford (Geo.
Robertson & Co.). It is a story of “broncho-
busters,” cattle-lifters and girls out West;
one ranch is at war with another and the
guns are going nearly all the time.
Like many reformers, he gets mto gaol; like
most men, “a woman tempted him and he
did fall.” Eventually he goes to Congo and
has a strenuous time there. McG-lusky’s ex-
ploits are fairly steep, but interesting.
A new magazine is in process of incubar
tion in Sydney, and may be hatched out next
January. It is to be called Lilley s Maga-
zine, and will be conducted by Norman
Lilley, of the Sydney Worker. There is
room for more than one Australian maga-
zine, and the new venture will be welcomed
by readers and writers.
The author's preface to Mark' Twain's Speeches
(Sydney Book Club) warns the reader against eat-
ins: too much molasses or taking too much non-
sense ;it once. It would not be fair to judge
Mark as a humorist or a speaker by this collec-
tion. Without the personality of the speaker,
half the effect is lost; some of the anecdotes
occur twice in these pages, and the plums have
been staled by frequent quotation. A much
smaller collection would have fjiade a book more
agreeable to the general reader.
A. G. (“Smiler”) Hales gets quite as
much fighting into the career of McGlusky
the Reformer (Unwin), but here it is with the
fists of that big, gaunt Australian son of a
Scotchman who figured in a previous story.
He fights the Devil in Glasgow with words
and deeds, using gentle persuasion such as
this:
Giving vent to a wild shout, the slogan of his
father s clan, he leapt at the carrier with both
hands extended, and caught him by the whiskers.
Then, with his great fists full of hair, he dug his
toes into the roadway and commenced to whirl
the carrier round and round like a Catherine
wheel.

THE PIONEER and CLEMENTS TONIC
Mr. J. J. HOGG.
Mr. J. J. Hogg is one of Brisbane’s best-known
photographers for over 20 years. He has held
a nifmber of secretarial positions. He speaks
of the merits of this medicine and its Value in
the backblocks of the Northern State years
ago where doctors were few.
“214 Elizabeth Street, Brisbane,
“ 22nd August, 1910.
“ CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ For a long number of years
Clements Tonic has been my only
medicine—and weli it has done its
duty when 1 was exploring and doing
pioneering work in the north and
west of Queensland. I-was the first
white man (with perhaps the excep-
tion of Capt, Cook) to set foot on the land where Cooktown
now stands. My constitution has received many severe
wrenches through Sciatica, Indigestion and other troubles,
which are almost inseparable from continued outdoor exist-
ence. It was at this period, after repeated failures with other
medicines, that 1 started using Clements Tonic perseveringly.
Its rejuvenating and restorative effect upon me was astonish-
ing, and, thanks to that remedy, 1 have lived to see all weak-
nesses and ailments driven out of my system, and am in
excellent health. For many years I have been in business
in Brisbane as a photographer, and, as above indicated, have
kept my health by a judicious use of Clements Tonic when
my system seemed to need it.—Yours truly, J. J. HOGG.”
All suffering men and worn n should keep Clements Tonic in the house, when it can be obtained easily
from all chemists and stores at a reasonable price, which is not to be compared to its great health value.
It is the silent home doctor for all homes, especially in country parts, where doctors are few, for it checks
and pi-events disease. For Insomnia, Brain-fag, Biliousness, Sick Headache, Lassitude or Weakness,
Poor Appetite Indigestion, Constipation or Insomnia, it gives certain relief. It is sold everywhere.

VARICOSE
VEINS
IN THE LEGS
ARE
CURABLE.
FOR many
years past,
Varicose
Veins have been
looked upon as
generally incur-
able, except
with the assist-
ance of the
surgeon’s knife,
and those who
understood the
subject realised
that method to
be one of pro-
crastination
only, for the trouble invariably returned.
The VECSEY METHOD OF TREAT-
MENT absolutely cures the worst eases by
external application only, and without laying-
up. A method of cure that gives no unpleasant
trouble and that is painless and efficacious to
the utmost degree.
Only those who have seen many cases and
those who suffer can realise the dreadful
affliction that Varicose Veins are. A painless
cure is, under the circumstances, a positive
boon to humanity.

First Blossoms of Spring.
I Dear trees I have raised in my leisure,
When wearied of papers and books;
I have pruned them in moments of pleasuie,
They are ever, my gladness and treasure —
Brown’s hobby is bantams and chooks !
He has poultry that chortles and screeches.
And roosters that bark in the night;
But I have my apples and peaches—
My pear-tree that splendidly reaches
Towards Heaven with sheltering height!
There’s Jones with a craze photographic,.
And Thomson who thinks he can sing ;
But mine heart croons a song that is sapphic,
When I notice with feelings seraphic
First blossoms of Spring!
Dear trees that are green with new splendor
(Where’s a match and my Sabbath cigar?)
While the church-folk their psalm-singings render,
With a heart that is cheerful and tender
Let me walk where my fruit-blossoms are !
Let them pray in their churches and chapels—
All’s well with creation for me ;
Whilst the parson with wickedness grapples,
Let me stroll ’midst my plum-trees and apples
And gaze on each burgeoning tree !
Brown’s bantams are clucking and fighting,
With his kodak goes Jones on the wing ;
But for me, when I’m tired of much writing,
It is joy undiluted when sighting
First blossoms of Spring !
Dear trees —they are leafy and sappy.
(Old Thomson is singing next door ;
But I find I can pardon that chappie,
For a man who is cheerful and happy
Sings himself in his heart’s deepest core.)
’Midst my trees I am smoking contented,
In the distance lifts wowserdom’s yell;
They are yowling like tom-cats demented—
If they’ve really and truly repented,
Shall I rob the dear friends of their Hell ?
Let them yell till they’re tired, if they want to —
’Midst my trees I’m a duke and a king ;
Let the brethren be dipped in the font too,.
See my blooms of delight— lo ! the u flaunt too,
First blossoms of Spring !

A Lament for the Souter Cat.
When the dark of eve is falling
I think of the days of yore ;
Puss, puss, puss, I am calling,
As I turn th&pages o’er ;
Tender as dreams of a lover
Are the fancies that come to me
As I handle the old red cover—
Oh, where can that pussy be ?
Sad is the question and solemn,
For in vain I search and call.
The Wild Cat sits on its column,
But the pages are empty all
Of the strange, tame beast that haunted
My dreams for many a year.
It’s the Souter puss that is wanted,
The cat that the heart holds dear.
Puss, puss, puss, I am calling,
As I turn the pages o’er—
Felines are weirdly miawling
Under the wash-house flpor—
Hop’s little boy from Manly
Is wearing the same old hat;
0 pages that flutter wanly,
Where, where is Souter’s cat?
Oft in the evening stilly
Have I joyed in the work of Minns,
The grateful lines of King Billy,
The lips of the smiling gins ;
Oft with the wondrous kiddies
Of Norman Lindsay I sat,
His blokes and donahs and biddies
But Vtoyed, the Souter eat.
Vincent has straight-lined fancies,
Dyson still runs to curls,
And always I know that the chance is
I shall find some Souter girls ;
I shall find the Souter maiden
In remarkable garments drest;
But, oh, in what distant Aiden
Has the cat been laid to rest ?
Wonderful friezes brighten
The walls of the Souter room,
Marvellous blossoms lighten
The carpeted floors with bloom ;
Astonishing are the tresses
That shadow the stately head,
And, oh, the swirl of the dresses—
But the Souter cat is dead.
Cat of the wondrous seeming,
Cat of the arching spine.
Piebald, sedate and gleaming
With a polish and special shine ;
You winked from the bygone pages,
And your whiskered smile shone through
With the sphinx-like wisdom of ages—
Ah, pussy, you knew, you knew.
Puss, puss, puss, I am calling,
As I turn the pages o’er.
While the dark of the eve is falling,
And I think of the days of yore;
Tender, as dreams of a lover,
Are the fancies these leaves have fed,
Under the old red cover.
But the Souter Cat is dead.

Mr. Charles Carter told the Burton-street
Baptist meeting last night of a marvellous
answer to prayer he had experienced. The
society he belonged to in Melbourne had had an
overdraft of £2l. he knew that by the Lime
tho next meeting came round it would he
doubled. Ho made it a matter of prayer, and
asked tho Lord for £lOO. But the money did
not come. A tew days before the meettog his
faith drooped, add he prayed "Lord, l, don't aaa
for the hundred now, £ut do send uS the twenty-
four and wipe off ouroverdraft." The Monday of
the meeting came, and he watched for the post-
man. but still there was ao cheque. Four o'clock
in the afternoon came, and the committee began
to gather. His faith began to droop, but Jutt
as the meeting was about to commence a letter
was handed him. "Dear Sir.” It read. "En-
closed please find cheque for £lOO for the
funds of the Evangelisation Society as a tbauk
offering from the Arm which we trust will be
the means of spreading tho gospel and thus
bringing blessing to others. Yours very truly,
William Crosby and Co" (Applause! “That
was lovely, wasn't It?” Mr. Carter. "I

of time as If the Lord had said 'You asked for
that hundred aud you ought not to have dropped
to twenty-four. 1 " Mr. Carter la nresldent of
the Baptist Union of Victoria.
If prayer could be relied on In
business it would be precious
handy. Imagine negotiatin’ overdrafts by faith instead of the
clumsy old-fashioned way of lodgin’ securities!

piece in the Sydney D.T. Always will-

WANTED, A NEW DEFINITION OF
BRIBERY.
Something which is very much needed in these
strenuous days of State politics is a Commission
to inquire into and define bribery. Bribery is a
vast subject and a complicated art. Some varieties
of it are obvious enough, and call for no further
definition—the crude samples which consist of
giving money or money’s worth to the individual
with a view to the purchase of his or her vote, as
when the Wade party in Federal politics tried to
buy 700 female voters in a heap with food, drink
and musical entertainment. This sort of thing:,
however, is generally done in a small way even at
the worst, for, with plain, ordinary bribery, the
candidate, or a few of his enthusiastic sup-
porters, have to find the cash; and, as a
rule, all the cash they can find doesn’t go
very far. Therefore, the attempts to pur-
chase a vast amount of public support with
about sixpenn’orth of tea and bun per head and a
few chords of amateur melody, are seldom seri-
ously disastrous, though they are aggravating,
wildly impudent and utterly unscrupulous. The
food, drink and song variety of corruption might
become dangerous if anyone could discover how
to pay the bill with anIOU redeemable by pos-
terity at any date from 20 to 50 or 100 years
ahead ; for in that case it would be possible, unless
the police intervened, to give every elector free
victuals and gratis drink for six weeks before
polling day, and even to throw in lodgings and
hot baths, and a good many votes could be
acquired on that lavish basis. Happily, the
need for money down puts a strict _ limi-
tation upon the possibilities of the business;
and, besides, the cold hostile eye of the Law is
always liable to be called to it, and the long blue
arm of the Law will interfere with it upon suf-
ficient provocation. But, of late, a method has
been discovered whereby it is possible for the
party in power to bid for large masses of support
“ upon the nod,” and yet keep quite outside the
range of the optic of the Law. It doesn’t require
any expenditure of the candidate’s cash, which is
good for the candidate. It doesn’t even demand
the expenditure of public cash, which is fortunate,
because (1) the Auditor-General is apt to make
trouble when the public cash is used for illegiti-
mate purposes, and (2) any such use of the public
cash tends to reduce the beautiful surplus, and
thus depreciate a valuable election asset. It simply
involves the handing out of the public’s lavish
I O U, and the I O U is so devised that the
Auditor-General has no official right to interfere
with it. And as regards the limits of the IO U—
well, it should be large enough to rouse the grati-
tude of the recipients, and yet not so enormous as
to Vie an obvious absurdity. Otherwise, there are
no limits at all.
* * * *
The new method is a great improvement upon
the old crude election promise. Any candidate can
promise anything at an election or at any other
time. Thus, the bridge between Sydney and North
Shore and the Sydney city railway have been pro-
mised more or less regularly for 50 years, yet
neither of them has arrived ; and almost every
town in the State has been promised a railway, a
new gaol, a new courthouse, a lunatic asylum, a
breakwater, a dredge, a public park and sundries.
Assurances of that sort cut only a moderate
amount of ice nowadays. But when a measure is
actually passed conferring a huge special benefit
on a large and influential class, the thing becomes
tangible. It may be fairly assumed that a good
many members of that class will vote for the
Government, partly out of gratitude for benefits
received (on paper, at all events), and partly out
of a fear that if a different party gets
into power it may take the benefits away
again. And the affair being so arranged
that it calls for no immediate coin, and
simply leaves a huge, undefinable liability which
isn’t likely to fall due until the present political
generation is quite dead, it is the very cheapest
way of acquiring support that can be devised.
Also, if it is a perishing party which does the
deed, it has the joy of knowing that the bill will
almost certainly be presented to its enemy, to
cover .him with embarrassment and bring discredit
on his finances.
* * * *
The Wade Government’s recent Railway and
Tramway Superannuation law is a case in point.
It is a wildly liberal measure, and nothing like it
has been seen or heard of before. The old N.S. W.
Civil Service and Police Superannuation Funds
weren’t built on anything like so lavish a prin-
ciple, yet they both went utterly broke. Under
the Wade system each railway servant is to con-
tribute to the fund per cent, of his salary.
There are provisions for the return of all contri-
butions to the relatives of officials who die before
attaining the pension age; so each man will, to
all intents and purposes, have only his own con-
tribution and the uncertain State subsidy to rely
upon. The man who retires at the age of 60,
after 40 years’ service at an average pay of £2OO
a year, will have contributed £l2O in all towards
his pension. He will then start to draw £133 6s. Bd.
per annum ; so his own payment will meet the
liability for about 11 months. Yet, according to
the life assurance tables, he may reasonably expect
to live for nearly 13£ years, which makes him a
liability or debit or dead loss of over £l6OO. If he
retires at 40 owing, say, to the loss of a leg or any
other injury which unfits a man for service yet
doesn’t necessarily reduce his chance of attaining
old age, he will have paid, on the same salary
basis, £6O, and he will be entitled to draw at least
£66 13s. 4d. per annum ; and, according to the life
assurance table, he may be expected to draw it for
25£ years. In one case, he is promised about
£1770 for £120; in the other, he is promised
about £1682 for £6O. In 1901 the N.S.W. rail-
way employees numbered 13,119; in 1909 they
were 19,458 (19,458 possible pensioners represent-
ing an average possible pension liability to
the Treasury, according to the rate of pay,
of about £lOOO each, or over £19,000,000
in all); and how many they will be in 1920 or
1930 Heaven only knows. Long before the Bill
got through Parliament the position was recog-
nised as being so desperate that the payment of
the pensions was not made a fixed charge on the
revenue in the same way as the Governor’s salary
or the interest on the public debt. The annual
shortage, when it commences to assert itself a few
years hence, is to be provided for by an annual
vote of Parliament, if Parliament feels inclined to
make the vote. The IO U is to be paid by pos-
terity, if posterity feels inclined —not otherwise.
Therefore it isn’t even the I O U it pretends to
be. The railway servant aged 21 will pay his
compulsory contribution, and see it eaten up each
year in meeting current pensions. He will have
the joy of knowing that his only chance of getting
a single penny in his own old age will depend on
the liberality of the Parliament of 1949. And he
will also have the satisfaction of knowing that it
isn’t bound to pay, and that by 1949 the pension
liability will probably be so vast that it simply
can’t pay.
* * * A
That bid for the goodwill of nearly 20,000
voters (the bill to be left to posterity) is remark-
able enough in its way, but it is by no means the
only amazing 1 0 U the Wade Government has
floated at the prospective cost of the infant. For
instance, consider this outpouring by the S. M.
Herald in its leading columns (28/9/TO): —
There is one piece of legislation passed by the Govern-
ment of Mr. Wade which every Liberal candidate and
every Liberal worker in this campaign should bring pro-
minently under the notice of electors, especially those in
the country districts. That is the Closer Settlement
Promotion Bill, which the Minister for Lands, Mr. Moore,
piloted through the House LAST SESSION. In the great
ado about leg-irons and rockchoppers and aged debtors
much of the best work of the Liberal Government has
received only passing reference, even by Liberal speakers,
whereas it is worth the full-st discussion. The Oloser
Settlement Promotion Act is an emphatic instance oi
this. In the last Parliament several valuable measures
were passed for the benefit, in the first place, of men
already on the land. The Oloser Settlement Promotion
Act, however, appeals directly to the interest of
the man who is anxious to secure a holding of
his own, but has very little money with which
to make a beginning. Under this Act any three
or more responsible men who can come to an arrange-
ment with an owner to sell them farms on his estate, and
can put down 5 per cent, deposit, may borrow the re-
maining 95 per cent, from the Advances Department of
the Government Savings Bank for the completion of the
purchase. The bank then takes the place of the original
owner, giving the borrower 30 years in which to repay
the debt. That is to say, the settlers who acquire their
holdings under the provisions of this Act find themselves
in the same relation to the bank as the settlers on re-
sumed holdings stand in relation to the Lands Depart-
ment. No such liberal financial assistance to poor men
to get on to the land as this Act provides is given in any
other State of the Commonwealth, and the full signifi-
cance of the Act has only to be grasped in order to
engender enthusiasm among all men of small means who
are looking to the land as their ultimate home.
It is a scheme which is obviously calculated to
make two classes feel good towards the Wade
Ministry—(l) Every poor man who wants to buy
land, and (2) every rich man who has land to sell.
It is calculated to please the land-seller down to
the ground, for it qualifies almost everybody to
be a possible buyer, and in the multiplicity of
buyers there are competition and high prices.
And it is calculated to please the land-buyer
right up to the sky, for it enables almost every-
body to do a gamble in soil, and there is always a
chance that the gamble may turn out profitably.
True, the Advances Department of the N.S.W.
Government Savings Bank is likely come to
awful grief over it, just as the old N.S.W. Ad-
vances to Settlers Department did, though on a
much larger scale ; for this concern is to lend much
larger sums than the old busted Department
did, and lend on a smaller margin, and
lend on the high valuations of good seasons —
not on the low valuations of unutterable drought.
But the day when the Advances Depart-
ment of the Savings Bank has to take stock
and write off huge losses is a long way off, while
the general election is very close at hand —almost
right here, in fact.
* # * *
The same element of utter financial reckless-
ness appears in both these devices. The pension
idea promises for a payment of £llos. per cent,
benefits, which, according to the experience of
life assurance societies and the knowledge of
actuaries, can only be supplied at a cost of £8 or
£9 per cent. The land bank idea undertakes to
advance at a time of good seasons, high land
prices and general boom, up to 95 per cent,
of the value of the security, despite the
fact that banks which, in a very similar time,
advanced only about 60 or 70 per cent, went down
like houses of cards when the drought and the
low prices came. On a rough estimate, it seems a
case of advancing 70 per cent, at the very outside
as a business proposition, and 25 per cent, to help
the Wade Government over the election. If it
was enacted that for every £95 that the Savings
Bank advanced on £lOO worth of security, the
Treasury should deposit (say) £2O as a guarantee
against loss, and that for every £1 which
a railway or tramway official paid into the
pension fund the Treasury should immediately
pay £5 or £6 in order to keep the fund farly sol-
vent, then the people would know how they stood,
and exactly how much reverence and gratitude
they owed to Gregory, the Wonder-worker.
But, for election purposes, it pays better to pose as
the benevolent magician who extracts great largess
out of an old hat, and by his astonish.ng manu-
facture of money earns the boundless gratitude of
the electors. The party which Wade represents
is famous for earning the boundless gratitude of
the electors. Its pose as a crowd which
gaily extracted great largess out of an
old hat wrecked in succession the old
Civil Service Superannuation Fund, the Police
Superannuation Fund, and the original Advances
to Settlers Department. Now it is at the old
game in a larger, wilder fashion than ever before.
* * * *
All this brings the writer back to his starting
point—the need for a new definition of bribery.
It is illegal for a candidate to buy individual
votes with his own money or his own refreshment.
It is illegal for his supporters to buy individual
votes in the same fashion. It is illegal for the
party in power to buy individual votes with
Government money; also the existence of an
Auditor-General makes it exceedingly difficult to
do so. The buying of votes with promises of roads,
bridges, railways, etc., is a game at which the
Government and the Opposition can play equally
well, and in any case the electors are doubtful
about mere promises. But the purchase, or
attempted purchase, of support with posterity’s
lOU is another matter. It is a device that only
the party in power can employ, for the party in
power has the majority required to put the
measures through—therefore it has a great advan-
tage over the Opposition. It is a device that
doesn’t immediately increase the outgoings, or
enhance the public borrowings, or reduce the
surplus, or otherwise spoil the Government’s
reputation for Heaven-born finance. It doesn’t
rouse the Auditor-General to interfere. And
there is no definite limit to its operation;
the next Government, instead of promising a
railway servant £133 6s. Bd. per annum pension in
the dim future for £3 a year may offer him £2OO
per annum for 4s. 6d.; and in place of offering to
lend 95 per cent, of the boom value of the land it
may offer 99| per cent, or 147 per cent. Posterity
can repudiate one impossible pension as easily as
the other, and the Advances Department of the
Savings Bank can go broke about as well on a
99£ per cent, basis as a 95 per cent. one. All
the same, a new and improved definition of
bribery would be an interesting thing to have
about the house. Even if it did little actual ser-
vice, it would be a valuable addition to Australian
literature.
THE BOARDING-HOUSE AND ITS
DEFENDERS.
Every settler should have the right to make his hold-
ing freehold. The day of building large estates is
past, and there is no danger in giving a man a freehold
in his own country. If land is to become your own you
will work for it. If only a tenant, then who is going
to tight for it? We must give more than tenant rights.
They can be got in Eussia. —Typical Wade -ite candidate.
In the political scrum which is now agitating New
South Wales the Labor party stands for the policy
of State leasehold, and objects to any further alien-
ation of the public estate. That being so, it was
only to be expected that the “ Liberal or Wade
party should raise its desultory howl in the cause
of the freeholder. No reasonable person can sup-
pose in view of the evidence, that there is any
honest conviction behind the howl ; but it is a
feasible noise and is likely to do the party
some service. Almost every man who is on the
land desires to hold the freehold of his allotment.
It may not be a matter of public policy that he
should do so; but, like the tendency to war, drink.
tobacco, gambling and the other man’s wife, the
craving is there, and the party that panders to it
gets votes. It doesn’t even require to pander in-
telligently or coherently ; almost any foolish old
way of pandering will bring a certain amount of
support. No crowd could be a less satisfactory-
looking prop of the freehold idea than that which
shambles behind Gregory Wade, yet quite a
number of farmers seem to take it seriously.
* * * *
There are just two reasons why the man on the
land is unable, in many cases, to get the
much-prized freehold of his farm. O ne 1S
that the private landlord won’t sell—-that
he hangs on to the property like grim death
and charges £2 per acre per annum rent; the
other is that the State won’t sell—that it hangs
on to the property like grim death and charges
about 2s. per acre per annum rent. In each case
the land is really freehold —that is to say, the
State is the freeholder in one case, and a private
owner, named possibly Smith, is the freeholder in
the other. In each case, too, the land is really
leasehold ; that is to say, the tenant leases it in
one instance from the State at a low rate, and in
the other from Private Landlord SMITH at a very
high one. The Wade party, however, makes
a shoddy and hypocritical pretence of wa,nt-
ing the actual tenant to own the freehold ,
that is to say, it wants him to get the freehold it
the nation is his landlord, while if the Berry or
Cooper, or some other private estate is his land-
lord, it doesn’t care a single hollow mockery of a
curse whether he gets it or not. Where the
people own the land and let it to Agriculturist
Jones the Wade crowd holds that the landlord
(i.e., the nation) should be required by law to sell
out to its tenant on demand, and at a very low
figure ; when a private individual owns the land
the very idea of compelling him to sell to his
tenant upon demand is regarded by the Wade
push as a shocking outrage, and the idea of com-
pelling him to sell at less than the highest price
he could screw out of the buyer would be the same
outrage multiplied by ten.
* * * *
Under these conditions the N.S.W. Govern-
ment’s freehold theory looks absurdly thin. It is,
in fact, a gigantic and unscrupulous system of
bribery done with public money. The Govern-
ment requires the votes of the State tenants who
want the freehold, and also those of the private-
tenants who can’t get a freehold from their
own landlords or can only get it at im-
possible prices, and who are anxious to
see some prospect of a freehold somewhere.
And it desires to get the support of this latter
class —the private tenants —without losing" the
support of the private landlords, whose hbvvl
would tear the heavens asunder if it was proposed
to give the occupier of private land the same
compulsory purchase rights as the State tenant is
to have. The simple way out of the difficulty is
to pacify all parties concerned by distributing
State assets at much below their value. It is
just as honest a process as if the votes were bought
by distributing public cash out of the Treasury,
or by selling sovereigns out of the Treasury at 10s.
each; but it isn’t such an open and glaring scandal.
The reason why we know that the motive is the
purchase of votes, and that it is not devotion
to the freehold ideal, is simply the _ fact
already mentioned, that the case of the private
tenant excites in the Wade Government’s bosom
no interest whatsover. To buy his support at the
loss of the support of his landlord and all the
press which represents the landlord wouldn’t pay,
and the Wade Ministry can’t afford to have prin-
ciples that don’t pay.
As a matter of fact, it and the Tory class which
it represents don’t care a straw for anybody's free-
hold except as a matter of acquiring votes or of
making money by land speculation. The present
occupier of State lands is to have the coveted title,
if the Wade Government can give it to him.
When he grows old and retires from active
business—or possibly long before he grows
old—he can et his land, and the fact that his
tenant and all the long succession of tenants
from then to Judgment Day will then be back
in the old position of leaseholders, only at a
greatly enhanced rent, doesn’t trouble the Wade
following at all. If it did, a cardinal feature of
the “Liberal” policy would be a proviso to the
effect that no man who buys land from the State
shall be allowed to let it under any circumstances
whatsoever —that when he ceases to want the land
for his own use he must sell to an actual occupier,
and that the new owner, and all succeeding
owners, must do the same in turn, so as to pre-
serve intact the principle that ownership and
tenancy should go together. But that, un-
fortunately, would anger the present man—the
man whose vote has to be purchased—by
limiting the possibilities of unearned increment,
so the principle has to go overboard. It has been
said that no man ever shouldered a rifle in defence
of a boarding-house. The WADE-ite politician
quoted above goes further, and declares that no
man will shoulder a rifle in defence of a house or
a farm unless it is his own. In that case, the
natural inference is that the Wade Government
doesn’t care whether anybody shoulders a rifle or
not, so long as it gets over the election without
losing its billet.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Passing of the Old Locomotive.
The tangled railway gauges of Australia have
attracted the attention of Prime Minister Fisher,
who reckons that something should be done in
the matter. The said gauges vary from the sft.
3in. system of Victoria down to the little bang-
tail 2ft. lines owned by the divisional boards of
North Queensland, whereon a little row of jim-jam
or nightmare carriages is clattered and bumped
along by an engine of any old shape and no
definite size. Mr. Fisher considers that the hour
has arrived for the establishment of uniformity,
either by the Commonwealth taking over the
railways or by agreement among the States,
and no person in his senses is likely to disagree
with him. The variety of gauges is bad for com-
merce, is unpleasant for passengers, and is calcu-
lated to absolutely paralyse defence. When the
day of trouble comes, Australia will probably find
the mobility of its army reduced by two-thirds
through sheer muddle and cantankerousness on
the part of State Governments. And when it is
considered that Australia is now in the middle of
a great spurt of railway building, and is every-
where dashing down new lines, a great proportion
of which will shortly have to be torn up again, no
one can say that FISHER gave way to strong lan-
guage when he said that it was up to somebody to
do things. A curious feature of the case, however,
is that Fisher is understood to be in favor of the
old steam train run on the old standard 4ft. 05m.
railway. Apparently nobody in authority is able
to get away from the aged two-rail joss or supersti-
tion. Yet nobody has yet proved, or even seri-
ously alleged, that the gyroscopic mono-rail tram
of Brennan can’t do what is claimed for it, and


the things claimed for it are marvellous. Already
some hundreds of miles of Brennan’s one-legged
railway are contracted for, or under construction,
in Alaska and elsewhere; so evidently there are
hard-headed practical men who believe it has come
to stay. Therefore it is plainly the duty of the
Australian Government to start building 50 or
100 miles of mono-rail as a test, either in
the Northern Territory, or, if possession of the
Territory can’t be secured in time, in one of the
States; and to run trains furiously thereon and
see what will happen. The arrangements should
be made and the money provided right now —
before Parliament adjourns. The matter is more
important than 20 things that are being hustled
through—in fact, it is almost the most important
thing that can be put before this Parliament.
The Anglo-Monkey alliance expires in 1915, and
then, or even earlier, anything may happen. If
the new army that Australia is constructing
is to be able to get about and do things,
and not be hopelessly stranded in an odd
corner of the continent, it is necessary to
build railways to the far north and far west, and
to put the whole existing system on a uniform
gauge. If this can be done according to a device
which will reduce the cost of construction to
about one-half, and multiply the speed by nearly
three, then it is plain that that device should be
adopted. But Australia can’t be quite sure that
it is a safe proceeding to adopt it till the thing is
tested locally by actual experiment. And if Aus-
tralia’s rulers loaf around much longer they may
strike a set of circumstances in which there will
be no time for experiment. They may just have
to build any kind of old railway to the north and
west in the frantic scramble to put up some
kind or any kind of a defence; and
then they may find that the ancient two-rail
superstition is only a superstition, and that they
have wasted many needless millions on it only to
abandon it. Just now electricity is making the
old puffing, coal-burning locomotive, which lugs
its own water-tank with it, and carries its own
private conflagration in its stomach, look like
Noah’s Ark on land, and the old style of line
begins to appear suspiciously like a back number.
A country such as Britain, which has its railway
system almost complete, can take what time it
pleases to investigate these matters. But Aus-
tralia is only at the beginning of its railway-
building career, and it is absurd to spend millions
on the construction of lines built upon a system
which apparently has one leg in the grave and is
fast inserting the other leg.
An Overlooked Achievement of the “Liberal”
Party.
Allen Taylor, Mayor of Sydney, has let in some
light on the strange ways of the suburban aider-
men. Two or three years ago a syndicate fixed
up an agreement with the Balmain Council and
rolled a bill through Parliament, in the teeth of
Babor opposition, empowering it to light that and
other suburbs. Later on Newtown made a con-
tract with the co. ; and now Glebe is following
suit. In view of the latter event Allen Taylor
announces that the City Council offered to supply
Glebe with more light at a less price than the
co. is to charge; also it undertook to supply
neat iron poles instead of unsightly wooden
ones; further, the City Council undertook not to
use the dangerous, bare, overhead, high-tension
wires; and finally it offered Glebe the right to
take over the whole thing in 10 years. Yet the
City Council's offer was turned down. The same
thing happened in connection with the Newtown
offer : the City Council’s vastly superior proposal
was scorned, and the private co. was given 50
years’ exclusive rights. Now, it seems, Peter-
sham is in treaty with the same co., and
seems likely to make the same sort of extra-
ordinary bargain with the Private Enterprise
concern. “ I do not blame the directors of
the private c 0.,” says Mayor Taylor. “Itis no
business of theirs to protect ratepayers ; their sole
objective is to sell their light and power at the
highest rates obtainable ; and in the cases I have
mentioned their persuasive powers will appear to
have been of a very cogent nature.” That might
suggest corruption ; but it is more likely that pure
cussedness is at the bottom of the scandal. The
suburbs want light, but the suburban alderman
would apparently get it from the Devil rather than
from the Sydney City Council, lest it might push on
the movement for a Greater Sydney a yard or two,
Thus the suburbs are to be heavily penalised for
the next 50 years, so that the honor and glory of
the little tin-pot. alderman may be in no danger
of being dimmed. One point, however, remains
—a point to which the spokesman for the Sydney
City Council didn’t allude ; it was the “ Liberal ”
crowd which made this scandal possible. As men-
tioned just now, McGowen and other Laborites
fought the Bill which proposed to give the syndi-
cate the right to make these extraordinary bar-
gains with suburban aldermen; but the “Liberal”
majority prevailed. Wade hasn’t, so tar, included
this among the benefits he and his party have
conferred upon the people ; yet they haven’t done
so much that they can afford to ignore the mag-
nificent achievement.

The Sunday Entertainment Question in
Victoria.
Last week a deputation of reasonable citizens of
Melbourne, introduced by H. H. Champion, re-
quested the local gaud Mayor to call a public
meeting for the discussion of Premier Murray’s
Bill “ to prohibit payment for certain entertain-
ments on Sundays.” The gaud Mayor, declining
to make a move in opposition to Wowserism, the
rent of the Town Hall was promptly paid by
Champion, and the meeting will duly take place
on October 10. If Melbourne be really capable
of any public feeling, as distinguished from pri-
vate feeling, on the question of Murray’s
pitiful truckling to the aggressive Killjoy
minority in its midst, now is the time
for citizens to express it in a practical way. On
the evening of Monday next (10th) the meeting
will happen. The immediate cause of Murray s
Bill was, seemingly, the recent inauguration of
Sunday night concerts by the Vic. Professional
Orchestra. The Killjoy objection raised against
a Sunday cinematograph or theatrical show
cannot be urged against such orchestral con-
certs, offered with the object of improving
Melbourne’s musical taste. There are six nights
a week for comic operas, picture shows, variety
entertainments, etc., but only one night a week
when 50 or more professional musicians can be
joined together by their bond of union for the
discussion of Beethoven and Wagner. If the
people of Melbourne are to have high-class orches-
tral music from the most capable artists in the
evening, they must have it on Sunday. Further,
the power of music as an influence for Good
is admitted by the Killjoys. They have it in
their churches and chapels on Sunday. They
bring it to bear on the congregation when the
plate is going round. They employ it in hymns
and anthems to make the religious service attrac-
tive. They advertise it in the Saturday news-
papers. They take up collections from the people
who are thus drawn to the churches. Therefore,
the wowsers, having not even a Sabbatarian doc-
trine to hurl at the V.P.O. in particular, are praying
Premier Murray to pass a Bill which will empower
the Chief Secretary of the State Government to
prohibit all Sundav entertainments for which
tickets are bought and sold. The proposed Bill
speaks vaguely of “certain entertainments,” and
leaves the" exact rcope of the word “certain” to
be defined by the Chief Secretary of the moment.
Thusfar, there has been no talk of any exemptions
in favor of orchestral concerts, or lectures, or
other things which cannot by any stretch of the
imagination be classed as “ frivolous.” This is
the matter that Champion’s forthcoming meeting
must talk about if it is to be effective. Mere snorts
against Sabbatarianism in all its bearings are
never of any avail; but logical arguments, tem-
perately expressed, should establish the legality
of “certain entertainments on Sundays.”
Davy Jones, Wade and Co.
“ Billy B.’’: Premier Wade having utterly
failed to prove that Labor-man Flowers, M.L C.,
and chairman of the Public Works committee,
was responsible for the failure of the Government
to get a move on with the construction of the
North Shore bridge or tunnel, it may be permis-
sible to stop the sporting “Charlie” and ask
him a few questions about this matter. It may
be taken that Wade’s anxiety for the safety
of the people on the north side of the harbor
is very real. He says so, and even a cold
man like Wade could hardly develop any joy in
the risks run by thousands of men, women and
children every day on the crowded ferries running
out of Circular Quay. Every day and every
night, there are all the elements of a horror
beside which Sunshine and Richmond would
appear mere trifling accidents. Not a great ferry
carrying 1000 or 1500 sardined humanity shoulders
in or outof Sydney Cove, but Davy Jones’s Record
Clerk dips his pen in the inkwell, and waits for
the rush. So far it hasn’t set in, although there
have been sudden occasions when a skipper’s
heart has tried to climb up to his hat. So that
Wade’s apparent anxiety to escape anything of
the kind by providing safer means of transit is
very right and uncommonly civil. Unfor-
tunately, Wade’s view doesn’t tally with the
taken by Wade’s employees, the Har-
bor Trust and, more important still, by the
Ferry Trust. Wade will, no doubt, cry
that the Harbor Trust is not his employee, and
that to say otherwise is a cowardly slander and an
assassin-like blow; but the writer, remembering
how one Keele came to be a member of the
Trust, continues in his cowardly-like progress.
For years the congestion in Circular Quay has
been rapidly growing worse and worse, and if
Wade will say when his employees, the Harbor
Trust, or his political supporters’, the Ferry Trust,
or even himself, took steps to lessen it, I will
be obliged. Also, I will be stupefied and
confounded. On the other hand, I say that
Wade, by his neglect to deal with this matter,
and the Harbor Trust, by affability (we’ll say) to
the Ferry Trust, have dangerously increased the
risk to human life. When the water police, some
time ago, were forced to leave the corner where
the Japanese rnailboats berth, in order to make
way for another pontoon for the Ferry Trust,
there was so much outcry that it seemed as if
no further attempt to over-crowd the nar-
row water-space would be made, and that,
if the attempt was made, the sledge-hammer
which Wade is alleged to have concealed about
him would be swung with all the strength
“Charlie” gained on the sport-fields. Never-
theless the attempt has been made, and made
successfully; and another ferry pontoon has
been constructed on that side of the Cove
where the P. amj O. and Orient vessels
tie up, and close to the latter’s wharfage.
This time the press has not uttered one
yelp, for the obvious reason that Wade
can’t afford to have one more yelp or
even half a yelp yelped at him in the present cir-
cumstances ; but, after the elections, there will
be a considerable uproar. It will, of course, be
too late then—probably the Harbor Trust has
again signed, a long lease that will prevent the
scheme being overturned. The Harbor Trust is
so decent and affable that it will almost sign any-
thing. But that does not remove Charles
Gregory Wade’s responsibility; it merely in-
creases it. And, before I get drowned, I want
to know w'hat lie’s going to do about it.
Ma and the Commonwealth.
The bitter roar of Johnson, M.H.R., and the
Sydney Telegraph and other animals and circum-
stances about how the other States " induced
New South Wales” to federate with them has
been so very loud of late that it seems a fitting
time to ask these parties for particulars. So far
as all available records show, it was N.S.W. that
asked the other States to join it, not the other
States which asked N.S.W. to join them. If
there was a suppliant in the matter it was N.S.W.
And it is on record that, according to the agree-
ment arrived at by George Reid and the ottier
Premiers, and accepted by the N.S.W. Legisla-
ture, the Federal Constitution was to be legally
accepted in N.S.W. if it got a majority
of the votes cast at a referendum, and
the affirmative votes were not less than
50,000. It is also to be discovered, when one
looks back on the wilderness of Hansard, that
the N.S.W. State Parliament broke this agree-
ment and raised the minimum to 80,000, thereby
showing that N.S.W. owned the one and only
Legislature in Australia which couldn’t keep faith,
which couldn’t be decently honest and respectable,
and which had a natural tendency to be a liar.
It did this dirty action at the instigation of one
Neild, and N.S.W. had the misfortune to after-
wards elect the same shifty political creature as
one of its Senators. There was a majority in
favor of the Federal Constitution at the first
referendum—a majority large enough to secure its
acceptance according to the agreement made
by N.S.W. when it requested the other States to
join it, but not large enough to carry it in face of
the new arrangement made when the original
agreement was repudiated. Then George Reid
demanded that N.S.W. should have the Federal
capital, this being the smallest bribe for which
he would go on with his own Federal movement,
and the other Premiers weakly let him have his
way. The bargain was that the capital was to
be in a Federal territory, and situated at least
100 miles from Sydney ; and it has been carefully
fixed in a Federal territory part of which is only
87 miles from Sydney. And, as already men-
tioned, the Sydney Telegraph and Johnson,
M.H.R., are going strong about how the other
States “induced ” N.S.W. to federate with them.
Again the Parochial Naval Spectre.
Thk S. M. Herald rose again last Monday to
recite once more its amazing old tale about the
special fitness of Sydney to be Australia’s naval
base :
If the matter be regarded more particularly from the
point of view -of facts as they are, rather than as they
may be, the advantages of Sydney as a naval base appear
overwhelming. First of all, we have a harbor whose
equal it would be difficult to find, even if the whole
world were scoured in the search. Then much money has
already been expended upon naval works here. Besides
what has been done by the Imperial Government, we have
State and privately-owned docks, which are ready to hand,
and would be of incalculable service in time of war. We
have the nucleus of a shipbuilding industry, which is cap-
able of unlimited expansion under favorable conditions.
Within easy access lie the richest coal veins south of the
line, which mean the economical production of shipbuild-
ing material and fuel for the vessels when once they are
afloat. Then, at Lithgow, there are the only iron and
steel works in the Commonwealth. In regard to coal
and iron and steel, therefore, Sydney stands in a unique
position. No other port of the Commonwealth is, or ever
can be, so favorably situated. Then, again, if the Federal
Government fulfils its pledges in regard to the capital
site, Sydney will be the first great port within easy access
of that centre, an additional advantage, especially in time
of trouble.
It is an interesting deliverance, as showing how
far it is possible to go in the reckless sacrifice of
the interests of the country to a petty local vanity.
Sydney isn’t a very large harbor. It is more
densely crowded with mercantile shipping than
any other in Australia. There is no room in its
scanty limits for much in the way of manoeuvres
or training ; even the simple matter of sending a
naval boat’s crew ashore for rifle practice recently
led to a tragedy, a cargo tramp running the vessel
down with disastrous results. The harbor isn’t
fortified as a naval base ought to be, and the fact
that the biggest city in Australia lies beside it
makes land so expensive that the acquisition of it
for purposes of fortification would be very costly.
The entrance would only admit a first-class iron-
clad at certain states of the tide; the upper
waters of the harbor wouldn’t admit it
at all. (The entrance to Sydney, it may
be mentioned, is barely half the depth of the
entrance to Port Darwin, and it is shallower than
Gladstone, Albany, Hobart, and some other Aus-
tralian ports. In fact, the loose enthusiasm about
Port Jackson calls for some revision these days;
there are now big passenger steamers which
couldn’t crowd into it, and it doesn’t compare
with Rio Janeiro for depth.) If an enemy came
from Asia in the north or Europe in the west, a
fleet with its base at Sydney would either have to
let him ravage hundreds or thousands of miles of
coast with impunity or else fight so far from
its harbor of refuge that its crippled ships
would have hardly a ghost of a chance
to reach home in case of defeat. This sort of
thing is bad when it is unavoidable, but when
it is a perfectly needless risk it is awful. If the
fleet did manage to take shelter there after a
bad defeat the big city would be a hostage for it.
The enemy’s simple remark would be: “Come
out and surrender, or we burn Sydney.” No naval
secrets could be kept in a place where hundreds of
foreign spies could conceal themselves amid the
ordinary cosmopolitan population; in a purely
naval port every person not in the service can be
ordered off in times of doubt and trouble, but it is
impossible to order away 60 ,000 or 1,000,000
people. And if war seemed imminent, every
harmless-looking vessel which entered Sydney
would be a possible disguised torpedo craft or
layer of mines; yet shipping couldn’t be shut out,
as would be done in a purely naval port, without
such damage to trade as would reduce Sydney to
the commercial status of Townsville or Hobart.
It is for reasons like these that no great
country which knows anything of naval affairs
—not Britain or France or Germany or Austria
or Italy or tbe United States—has its naval
headquarters at a great commercial city. To the
people who understand marine affairs the advice
which the S. M. Herald gives to Australians
incredible folly, and the idea of completely sacri-
ficing the efficiency of the navy for the sake of
local vanity, or for the profit to be made out of
selling drink to the naval crews, is a madness
which passes belief.

Last Monday was the day of Sydney’s insanitary
Eight Hours’ Procession. All such things are
insanitary ; but this one is worse than others,
because it is larger. A procession may be defined
in a general way as a large thing that stirs up the
dust wonderfully with its feet. Banners show
above the cloud of grit, and boots show below it.
The rest is mainly grit. The germ of typhoid is
there and the germ of ’flu,’ and the germ of con-
sumption, and many other germs. If the
wind is blowing with the procession the van-
guard consists of dried and powdered traces
left by the casual horse; if the affair is
fighting against a head wind the cloud of des-
iccated horse remnants brings up the rear for pre-
ference. The function blocks traffic and causes
profanity. It marches through many streets, and
if any one street has a peculiar and notable smell
—say of fish or old vegetables or stables or
Chinamen—it gathers up as much as pos-
sible thereof upon its boots, and disseminates
it throughout the city. In a way processions
are picturesque, but very few people see them ;
and, anyhow, one procession is very like another. As
a means of celebrating the great events of history,
this stirring up of a great cloud of dust, to blow
through transoms, keyholes and open windows,
and get upon the food inside, looks particularly
futile. If the procession stayed at home, and each
member swallowed half a pint of dust in the
seclusion of his family, the most notable result
would be achieved just the same.

Henry Horsecollar writes
I rise to move that for the balance of this electoral
campaign the subject of Peter Bowling's leg-irons be
dropped. These aged ironmongery ought, in fact, to have
been dropped long ago. The constantclatter about them
brings the State Labor party no new votes ; the only
people who take an interest in the leg-irons are those
whose votes are secure alreadjL Peter Bowling certainly
calls for sympathy ; but he was an inconvenient and mis-
calculating person when he was at large, and now, when he
isn’t at large, he is still better off than a very large section
of the human race. It is impossible to prove that any
member of the Government really wanted Bowling
to be leg-ironed, so the debate gets no forrarder. Premier
Wade, for his own part, simply loves to hear about Bow-
ling’s leg-irons. All the time which Labor candidates de-
vote to talking about these substances is time that might
be spent, but to Wade’s great relief isn’t spent, in denun-
ciation about matters that would do him real damage.
His railway and tramway superannuation scheme,
with its promise of pensions which any actuary
can see it is quite impossible to pay; his
scheme for lending Savings Bank money up to 96
per cent, of the value of land at a time when land
values are booming, regardless of the fact that 75 per
cent, is considered a dangerously high figure in times of
comparative depression ; his transparent dodgery about
the Closed Ports —these three matters alone, if pushed
for all they were worth, would get the Labor party
such a majority that it could get Bowling out of
gaol at short notice. And that would do Bowling a lot
more good than 20 square miles of talk about what he
wore when he went into gaol. All this Bowling conver-
sation only tends to put the Labor party before the com-
munity as the party of small things. It suits the Gov-
ernment down to the ground that it should appear in
that light, but it doesn’t suit Labor, and Labor ought to
have realised it long ago. Therefore, let there be a great
silence about Peter Bowling.

The Commonwealth Statistician estimates the
population of Tasmania on June 30 at 183,387,
being 1999 less than at March 31 and 2437 less
than at December, 1908. The poor old Tory Isle
of Desolation is often found putting up records
like that. It isn’t densely peopled—not nearly so
much so as Victoria, for instance. It lias good
land, the most reliable rainfall in the Common-
wealth, abundance of minerals, fine harbors, a
supply of water-power for the cheap running
of its industries such as no other State
possesses, and a healthy climate. One evi-
dence of the salubriousness of the climate
is that it has the highest birth-rate in the
Commonwealth, and the biggest surplus of
births over deaths. Tassy has every natural
advantage that could possibly be required to
make it the Queen State of Australasia, and yet
its only fitting name is Mud. Its capital city is
the only one in the Federation which is growing
less. The population of the isle seems often
to be on the decrease. The people are the most
illiterate in the Commonwealth ; wages are the
lowest; manufactures and commerce the smallest
in proportion to population ; and the contribution
per head to the Federal revenue is the least. It
is impossible to account for this lamentable con-
dition of things except on the ground that Tas-
mania has always been the most Tory of the
States; that it has never possessed a strong
democratic paper or a powerful democratic party
in Parliament—in fact, that it has invariably
taken the advice of the Melbourne Argos variety
of publication, with the sort of result which might
reasonably be expected. Every community which
consistently takes the advice of papers like the
Argus goes the same road.
Some of the Naicest people who have been petting
the Dutchmen would have been badly shocked if
they had asked the visitors what they thought of
the Naicest people’s other pets, the Japs. The
Dutchman in the East Indies begins to look north
with just as much apprehension as the Australian.
True, the Jap himself doesn’t go into the Dutch
colonies in great numbers; instead, he encourages ,
the Formosan Chinaman to go, and the Formosan
Chinaman is a naturalised Jap, or a Chinaman
whom the Jap has swallowed. Further, the
Dutchman hears such remarks as those made by
Takekochi Yosabura, a member of the Japanese
Diet, who for years has been urging the Jap to
regard the Sunda Islands as plums to be picked
some day. Says Take, etc.:—
Holland is a country tenth jn rank of nations, small,r
weak and far away. She owes her very existence merely
to the rivalry and jealousy of the Great Powers of
Europe, and upon that jealousy alone is based the
security of Dutch East India. But the international
position will not always remain the same, and when a
division takes place Japan will claim the lion’s share.
No wonder the Dutch East Indian Government
sends round part of its navy to become better
acquainted with its friends !
The Singing River.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the night-winds croon and quiver, deep I
hear the singing river—
Singing loudly, chanting proudly as it rolls unto
the sea ;
And the wild birds flying over, swan and teal and
mountain plover,
Hear the song the river voices as it swirls inces-
santly !
’Tis the song the broad Euphrates sang where old
Assyria’s gate is,
Ancient song the dim Egyptian heard beside the
flooded Nile;
And the waters seaward flowing lift their pristine
anthem glowing—
Will the White Man never listen as it fills the
starry aisle ?
Hear ye not the singing surges as the water
swings and urges—
From the mountains living fountains roll their
precious wealth away;
Whilst the White Man sleeps unheeding, hear
the waters seaward speeding—
“ls there corn to-day in Egypt? Will the har-
vests always stay ?
Is the Nation swift and ready?” chanteth deep
each whirling eddy.
“Have ye builded dam and barrage; are the
Pharaohs wise and true ?
Are there husbands for your daughters?”—thus
the seaward-rushing waters
Ask Australia as they hasten all her hills and
valleys through !
Far and wide the waters spreading wealth of silt
and soil are shedding,
Singing river—’tis the giver of the harvests tall and
green;
But the Pharaohs (six or seven) lift their idle
hands to heaven
In the years when drought and anguish come with
seasons parched and lean !
No one careth for the morrow—corneth death and
bitter sorrow,
Years of weeping, years of praying to the gods
that will not hear;
Priests and people vainly kneeling—but the
waters, seaward stealing,
Sound an anthem filled with warning—speak a
message, deep and clear !
“Build ye dam and saving barrage, that your
sons may join in marriage—
Make, O Nation, preparation for the years when
harvests fail;
Waste ye not the precious waters —husbandmen
shall seek your daughters,
And the wheat shall fall in plenty from the great,
steam-driven flail;
Through the valleys, swiftly rushing, hear the
waters, deeply gushing,
Shall the White Man waste them ever, standing
by with idle hands ;
Shall the Pharaohs (six or seven!) always put
their trust in Heaven-
Will they never Think and Labor, giving service
and commands?”
When the storm-winds beat and quiver, thus I
hear the singing River—
Singing plainly, singing vainly, for the Pharaohs
never stir ;
They will neither hear nor hearken till the years
with anguish darken—
Till the bones of men and cattle find a common
sepulchre !
But the wild things flying over, teal and swan and
mountain plover—
They have heard the River’s anthem rising star-
ward mile by mile ;
Dust is Babylon, and blowing—but the old
Euphrates flowing
Joins the anthem surging loudly from Australia’s
wasted Nile !
VICTORIA.

“ K.” : So far, the only policy expounded by Pre-
mier Wade has consisted of whines to the effect
that Labor has vilified him, and made mudpiesto
throw at him, and that his Coercion Act was as
much the work of the Labor party as himself. No
one has the slightest idea of what the Wade
Government proposes to do if it is returned to
power. Labor, on the other hand, is pledged to :
(1) Abolish the Legislative Council; (2) reform the
electoral machinery; (3) stop the sale of Crown lands ;
(4) initiate a better system of closer settlement; (5) em-
bark on a policy of water conservation and irrigation ;
(6) restrict borrowing; (7) establish a State Bank ; (8)
inaugurate a graduated land tax for the avowed purpose
of bursting up big estates; (9) establish free education,
secondary, technical and university ; (10) re-establish the
old Industrial Arbitration Act; (II) inaugurate the zone
system of railway fares and freights; (12) regulate
the hours of labor bylaw; (13) make the law of work-
men’s compensation more equitable and simpler in its
working; (14) and; lastly, nationalise some coal mines.
It’s a sweeping programme, and should provide
work for the biggest Labor majority possible for
the next six years. Also, it is so sweeping that
something more than whines about “calumny
and misrepresentation ” will be required to block
it. Once that mass of ideas gets moving, it will
roll as irresistibly as an avalanche. Since April
13, Wade has tried to save his political life by
becoming the first pebble of the avalanche, and en-
deavoring to lead it into a devious way in which its
mass will be broken up. He misjudges the weight
of it, that’s all.
In summing up the case against Nathan Bear,
at the 'Melbourne Sessions, Justice Hodges
was unintentionally severe on the law of the State
that pays him. Bear was charged with stealing
some £l6OO from one Pktch, of Ballarat, the same
being the converted value of a quantity of gold.
The narratives of Fetch and his witnesses were
so discrepant that Hodges assumed that’ Petch
couldn’t properly account for the gold. If Fetch’s
view of the case was correct, Bear had annexed the
metal, or its value from Petch; so it became,
as the Judge put it, a case of using the Court for
the purpose of enabling two suspected thieves to
settle their differences; and the Judge, as an
•Hicer of the Court, wasn’t inclined to allow it to
be used that way. “ If,” said he, “ a thief steals
a watch; and a second thief steals it from the
first, is the law to be made $ catspaw to enable
the first thief to punish the second ? ” The illus-
tration was unfortunate, because the obvious course
of the law would be, not to let both thieves go their
ways, but to gaol them both. The law frequently
does that, only it calls the first individual a thief,
the second a receiver. There is, however, a
musky suspicion that the law was particularly
anxious to gaol Nathan Bear because he accused
one of its pet minions of attempting blackmail.
The'mimon being apparently disinclined to tackle
Bear openly, it was presumably thought desirable
to lumber that person by a side wind, as it were.
But the jury seems to have concluded that the
gaoling of Bear would serve no useful purpose,
and acquitted him, so the blot which Bear threw
on the administration of the law hasn’t been
wiped 'off. Which, in the present state of the
administration of the law in Victoria, is very un-
fortunate. For there are so many blots on it that
it can’t'afford to have another possibly undeserved
one remain upon its unfair face.
A sermon delivered recently by P.M.G. Thomas
—who is a local preacher in his spare time—
shocked the Melbourne Argus. Thomas pointed
out the disadvantages under which the poor labor,
owing to the present unequal distribution of the
results of toil. Said the Argus :
His views are as narrow and bigoted, as prejudiced and
unreasonable, as anything that ever proceeded Irom the
mouth of the most superstitious.
Then it summed up Thomas’s accusations ;
That a great army of people went short of the neces-
saries of life so that a few might wallow in the luxuries
and dainties of civilisation. Next, that a host was com-
pelled to live in the slums so that a few might live in
marble palaces. Is it possible to imagine a more poisonous
falsehood than that to spread among men ? A man’s wage
is determined by a man’s worth industrially, and by that
cClone. That is the general law.
Yet, as a matter of cold fact, Thomas’s charge
was so truthful as to amount to a commonplace. ,
Consider the farming industry. A landowner
lets his land by tender or at auction. It is com-
peted for by several families, who are anxious for
work. The result is that the rent paid for the
farm is so high that the lessee, his wife and family
have to work hard, often 14 hours a day, seven
days a week, all the year round, for,
in many cases, food and clothing alone. On
the other hand, the landowner and his family live
on the rent and do no work. Ricardo discovered
this —the “Law of Rent”—before the Argus
was born. By it the landlord takes all the product
of the ,land over and above what is sufficient
to keep ttye cultivator alive, and without the
least regard for the cultivator’s real industrial
value. The cultivator has to be given some-
thing ; otherwise he would die, and the landlord’s
rent would cease. So under the factory system ;
till regent years, when “ Socialistic legislation”
got to woglc, the toiler was suffered to earn, on the
average, only just enough to keep himself and a
small family alive. Only by the, constant efforts
of mqn like Thomas, aided by Trades Unions,
Wages, Boards, Arbitration Acts and various
other democratic devices, have the poor been
lifted a little way out of the Slough of Despond in
which they struggled helplessly for so long. What
has been achieved to date has been secured, to a
certain extent, by the tireless repetition of those
facts which the Argus variety of “Liberal”
sheet has always denounced as “poisonous
falsehoods.”
o
“ Bloggs,” on some curiosities :
Some of the N.S.W. anti-Labor candidates are basing
their claims on queer grounds. Macarthur Onslow, for
example, is running, not as the rabid Tory he is, but as a
“ Liberal.”
One of the latest reasons advanced why the electors
should plump for Wade is that 20 y> ars ago he was a
prominent footballer, and people called him “ Charlie.”
A doctor or two in the field make a powerful demand
for the support ofall good women” —on the principle,
seemingly, of one vote one visit (confinements a specialty)
John Haynes is pursuing a strategic line of ins own.
The following is being circulated about the Darlinghurst
electorate :
“SAMPLE OF MR. JOHN HAYNES’S SYMPATHY
FOR WOMEN.
“Should women or girls w'ho steal be prosecuted in
open court? We think not. And we believe, in the
immediate future, there will be, as with children, a pri-
vate court, not open to newspaper ghouls, for the due
punishment or correction of women or girls who are
caught shop-lifting. There are many things to account
to humane minds for the weakness of a woman or a girl
in a shop surrounded by temptations or depressed by
want oi* influenced by the tyrant Fashion. Some greedy
shopkeepers, who really make their fortunes out of
women's weaknesses of finery, have no soul for the weak
woman or girl who yields to their shop temptations, and
they'are greatly pleased when they see the unfortunates’
names emblazoned in print. To our mind, the news-
paper records of these prosecutions of women and girls
are a sickening scandal and a gross cruelty.”
Does John believe in votes for women? By all the laws
of logic he doesn’t. In his view, females are more or
less irresponsible, and on a mental and moral plane with
infants. He holds that in the presence of the “Tyrant
Fashion ” they are so uncontrollably liable to grab the
nearest article of value that they ought to be held blame-
less of moral guilt—just like lunatics. It is a weird point
of view to thrust forward with the object of attracting
female support. Are the women mostly shop-lifters in
Darlinghurst? And are the ones that don’t shop-lift, at
present, likely to be enthused at the news that in John’s
opinion they are liable, in the nature of things, to start
thieving at any moment ?
♦
The Sydney papers (24/9/TO) contained two refer-
ences to the proposed Australian Navy. One was
in the form of an address by Alderman T. H.
Kelly to the mostly anti-Australian and pro-
nigger British Empire League. An extract: —
It was suicidal to create local fleets instead of subscrib-
ing to the Imperial Navy, because the strength of any
body lay in its powers of co-operation ; but how could
this co-operation be achieved if the units were at differ-
ent sides of the globe? “ And in spite of this,” said Mr.
Kelly, “ the Governments of Australia, Canada and
South Africa have refused to subscribe to a single Im-
perial Navy. We are so afraid the Imperial Navy would
not be near our particular part of the world in war time
that we prefer to spend our money on ships of our own.
These ships will be compelled to remain in our own
waters until released by our Governments, when it may
be too la ! e for them to concentrate in effective co-opera-
tion for the defence of our common interests. We are
so nervous about our local dangers that we are blind to
the still greater national danger, which, if not checked,
will overwhelm us in complete and irreparable ruin.”
The other reference was contained in a cable
London, Friday.—Writing with regard to the Australian
destroyers, Mr. Gerard Fiennes, a prominent naval ex-
pert, says:—
“ The first ships of the Imperial Navy are on the way
to their station. The event has attracted little atten-
tion, but it is epoch-making. Australia and Maoril.md
will soon be in a position to make a serious contribution
to the force of the Empire in a part of the world where a
naval force will be required in a very few years. The
fact that Australia’s destroyers are ocean-going proves
that Australians were not influenced by narrow views on
the subject of local defence.”
Now, had Mr. Fiennes only had the sense to hold
off until he had learnt what the distinguished Mr.
Kelly had to say on the subject, what a heap of
ridicule he might have avoided !

In the Victorian Assembly, the other evening,
McGregor moved an amendment to the Educa-
tion Bill that the future minimum wage of female
teachers should, after 10 yeahs’ service, be £llO
per annum—£2 2s. a week. The justice of the
demand was as obvious as its modesty, and
even Corner Tories like McCutcheon and
Snowball backed it up ; but Murray and
Watt averred that the State couldn’t stand it—
it meant about £6OOO a year extra. What Weary
and Watt think of their administration of the
finances is best known to themselves, but the fact
sticks out plainly that a State that cannot afford to
pay its adult teachers two guineas a week, after 10
years service, had better go out of business. Vic-
toria’s educational system is Still formless and
embryonic, and the main cause of its inefficiency
is that it will not put up the Cash. General edu-
cation is, therefore, in the hands of men and
women for the most part so grossly underpaid
that they leave the service as often and as soon as
they get a decent opening elsewhere, many of the
brightest of them having left already.

“ Red Tape .Junior”: The hurried explanation of
Premier Wade that the Government; iias decided
to hand out more money to the N.S.W.
Public Service is the only hope he had of
staving off a block antagonistic vote on October
14. The P. S. Board’s statement that it divided
the recentiy-bestowed cash to the best of its
ability is probably correct; what the Service
complains of is that there isn’t much ability, and
what there is is of an inferior brand. According
to the chairma'n (Wilshire), the Board gave one
crowd £2O increases, another £lO, others £5 and £2.
The last-mentioned figure was the lowest, and I
leave you to imagine the fierce joy of the clerk who
got a rise of 9’23d. a week. Some received mote
—some of the Works engineers, for instance, who
came in for £5O, because, according to Wilshire,
they were so wretchedly paid that they were sky-
ing their jobd and leaving the country. But the
point •overlooked by Wilshire is that Wade
handed over the money in the first place as the
result of a promise to raise the salaries of those
who were receiving less than £l5O a year. It was
explained that this was done to meet the in
creased cost of living. Now this promise has
gone all askew, and the £l5O men are even madder
than they were before. To persons who knew
how mad they were before this may seem in-
credible, but it is a fact, all the same.

Erom a man who has had a good-sized fist in the
Government of Fiji:—
I have but just seen,a report of the Representatives’
discussion of Mr. Higgs’s motion, that a Commission be
appointed to inquire into the sugar industry. As the
sugar industry in Fiji is almost altogether an Australian
business (the only outsider, the Vancouver Co., sends the
whole of jts output to America), no Australian Commis-
sion would be complete without special evidence taken in
the island at the various sugar cent res. Whereas a com-
mission in Australia would probably deal with the indus-
try from a commercial point of view only, it is absolutely
essential that the other side of the picture, the moral
side, sliould be looked at too; and for that purpose Fiji
must be visited. It is well known that the wretched
Indian,, whose period of indenture is five years, looks
upon the five, when ended, as the nightmare of his life.
For an exhaustive inquiry into the. subject it would be
necessary for the (Government of Fiji and the Common-
wealth to act in unison. There are records in the Indian
Immigration Departmeht of the colony for the past 10
years that would make a Lbgrke’s hair stand on end.
Several causes are at work producing such results, but
chief of all is the system of what may be termed stan-
dardisation of labor. An overseer has a. certain number
of laborers under him and a certain acreage of cane
to be weeded, cut, etc. The records of each over-
seer with regard to the work do’ne and the cost,
are carefully gone over’ each month, and the
overseerwho has obtained the maximum of work at the
minimum of Co6t has his work putas astandard for other
overseers to come up to. If it is not attained, or there-
abouts, the overseer knows perfectly well what to ex-
pect. The result is that the overseer drives the Indian
boss, who in turn drives the indentured laborer, and the
desperate laborer either struggles on or .makes an on-
slaught upon his overseer. The responsibility for these
things rests with Australia ; its money is in the business,
and its markets take the c,rops that are raised under
these conditions. Wherefore, as I said before, no inquiry
could be complete which did not reach out to Fiji, and
even then it would have to look sharply to see all the
hidden sores.
“ Cleric ” writes :
A matter on which I am betting heavily in the coming
N.S.W. election is that John Haynes is going to lose his
deposit if he makes his threatened start for Darling-
hurst. Danny Levy trails a plethoric cloud of Yids and
anti-Laborites in his wake—stalwarts who couldn’t be
charmed into any other camp by the cutest Independent
that ever went electioneering. And J. D. Fitzgerald has
the Laborites with him to-a man, woman and bloke.
Fitzgerald will win, or thereabouts. I haven’t struck a
solitary clerk in the last three weeks—and I know a few
—who isn’t for Fitzgerald and decent pay. The trouble
from Levy’s viewpoint is that the penmen have been his
staunch supporters hitherto, and now he has lost them.
It is hard to see where Haynes looks for support in this
well-organised Tory-Democratic struggle. There are
plenty of places where there is room for a third man ; but
Darlinghurst isn’t one of them. It has always been an
unlucky place for the third man. The first man was
Nosey Bob, -the second was Bob’s assistant, and the
third was hanged by the neck till he was quite dead.

Shakspeare and Holy Writ have long held
a good lead in the literary race, and there is no
immediate chance that “The Night of the
Party ” will take their supremacy from them. In
fact, 10 years hence, it may be not even remem-
bered among the printed steeds that “also ran ”
across the page of history. Weedon Grossmith s
play (produced at Sydney Cri. on Saturday) has
the footprints of older dramatists all over it. The
lady who makes the complications, for instance,
is Lady Teazle with variations, though Sir C.
Hampshire doesn’t dodder to the same extent as
Sir P. Teazle, and the lady is not found behind
the screen—she takes a flying leap for the door in
time. She is an unaccountable person, who insists
on dropping in to eat purely platonic suppers
with a bachelor friend, who would much rather
she stayed away. She leaves for home at
10.30, and her bachelor friend flees to catch a
train at 11, and the servants’ surreptitious Party
begins at midnight. About 1 a.m. a raging ern-
ployer who hus missed his train returns to the
flat, and about 1.30 a.m. the unaccountable supper-
eating lady drops in again for no better reason
than that she was passing—no one knows why she
was passing—and saw a light. The same excuse
would justify her dropping into an active vol-
cano. Of course the members of the Party are
hidden in all manner of places and hear every-
thing. Except the honorable bald-headed man
under the table, they are quite unworthy of the
confidence reposed in them, and the worst of
them all is the flushed miscreant who is suffocating
in the box. In a faint sort of way the Party
threatens to blackmail Lady Hampshire in
the second act, but it doesn’t. Neither
does it blackmail her in the third act.
There she comes to say farewell to her platonic
friend, and is almost found on his premises by a
suspicious husband ; but, not being quite dis-
covered, nothing happens. And nothing else
happens, except that the curtain comes down.
Before this result is achieved the Party, all save
one man, has faded out of the story. Even the
ruffian in the chest has gone, nearly taking the
door with him in the great wobble of his mtoxica-
tion. * • »
* * * *
One or two of the characters are hard to
place. Miss Mab Paul, for instance, plays, and
plays excellently, Gipsy Vandelier, an adventuress
with a strenuous Past. She has nearly married a
nobleman, and has got £2OO a year compensation ;
she nearly marries the immensely rich Alderman
Hargen ; her dresses are superb, and she wants
to associate with the peerage. These things
suggest that she is the deer-park, motor-car,
country-mansion variety of adventuress, with
gems and oil-paintings. Yet she attends the
flunkeys’ midnight party and associates with the
bald butler, and the footman in livery, and the
domestic Mary Ann, and that maddened bird of
prey the hall porter ; and in this aspect she looks
like a mere barmaid or small beer lady, not much
above the status of a shop-lifter. Captain Bleary
(Harold Parkes),. who also associates with the
flunkeys and the hall porter, is evidently a warrior
without any of the prejudices of his caste.
Crosbie, the valet, played by David James, is a
knockabout person—a sort of inferior edition of
the Jones who Happened. He is the rushing
kind of servitor who passes himself off as his em-
ployer, calls that amazed individual bad names,
and conducts with a steady hand vast intrigues
that lead nowhere ip particular. The part
is about as well played as such a part
can be. George Willoughby’s bald-headed butler
—the one who is under the table iS a
fine character with nothing: definite to do save
remain bald, and Hugh Buckler has about the
same amount of luck. Two human and interest-
ing personages are Miss Amy Willard as the
Marv Ann of the flat where the Party happens,
and Miss Violet Page£ as the supper lady. As
for Sir Charles,, and the alderman, and the sketchy
girl who says “I dunno,” and the flushed ruffian
in the chest, they are an accidental lot hanging
half-way down the cliff of circumstance, like the
person mentioned by Shakspeare who gathered
samphire.
** * *
. Miss Gibbs continues in her situation,
amid the vociferous applause of all parties. Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) makes a wide appeal just
now. The “sport” is interested in the Gold
Cup, while the “crook” is absorbed with
the novel methods of its abstractors. The
trader revels in the spectacle of Garrod’s
and the gp.rgeousness thereof, and the well-trained
indifference of its employees to the flirtatious
arguments, rows and assaults that rage persist-
ently in its underclothing department. The sen-
timentalist joys over the various love-stories that
are presented ; and the mere girl-fancier is
cheered by the presence of Miss Blanche Browne
and her distracting colleagues. This state of
affairs threatens to prevail till further notice, and
for some days afterwards.

“The Little Breadwinner” has been earn-
ing enough during the past week to keep a roof
over the Hamilton-Maxwell dramatic family at
the Sydney Palace, and a bit besides for supper
beer and cheese, as well as the weekly instalment
on the piano and the motor-car. So far, how-
■ ever, the small girl who takes in washing for the
family has not ' given notice of starting a
laundry on a large scale, whieh would
seem to show that there isn’t as much
in the cdsual soap-sud industry as might be
supposed. The evil genius of the family, Joseph
Prior, is still making large! sums of money each
evening ; but, as he is nightly ruined before be
can get clear with the swag, therd'doesn t seem
to be much in the villain-industry either. An
ordinary, intelligent sharp would have changed
his tactics by this time; but Joe seems to be a
one-horse sort of knave, who will finish up with-
out any credit to himself or satisfaction to his
friends. If he kept going for another week he and
the Wade Government would be able to seek a
new job simultaneously. But, as a matter of fact,
he gives in earlier; whereupon the co. will ex-
plain “Why Men Love Women.”

The once-a-week paper has a breathless
time when it sets out to pursue with the gun of
criticism such an agile crowd as the J. C. William-
son Grand Opera Co., now travelling at the rate of
about three operas a week at Sydney Royal. It is
liable to arrive at the fugitives’ last camp just
when the ashes of the camp-fire are getting cole.
On Monday night last the fleeing co, sang its way
through Puccini’s “La Boli&me,” with Amy.
Castles as Mimi. Roberts was to have wrestled
with the music of Rudolf; but a cold had him by
the throat, and Blarney took his place. Ihe
Castles lady died beautifully in her garret; and
she and the other mimes contrived to look really
cold, in spite of a theatre made stuffy by the fierce
Eight Hour westerly. To-night (Thursday) and
on Saturday Bel Sorel will flutter as Madam
Butterfly. The intervening Friday is dedicated
to Castles in Cavalleria and Pagliacci.
“OUR MISS GIBBS,” AT HER MAJESTY'S,
SYDNEY.
Timothy Gibbs (Bertie Wright) and the Hon.
Hughie (Langford Kirby).
Calve made a final and brilliant exit on
Saturday last, at Sydney Town Hall, to the crash
of falling furniture. In the tavern scene from
“Carmen” (given in costume), where the wretched
Don Jose has his helmet and sword thrown at
him for showing anxiety about his steady job
when the regimental trumpets sound, Calve had
been hurling chairs over the stage into the hall,
and a part of her costume suddenly showed signs
of collapse. Don Jose Gasparri sang bravely on
whilst the lady did a. few conjuring tricks with
pins, and ,a thoroughly musical audience wriggled
with laughter. Oalve’s treatment of the fiery
Carmen music was a thing to remember; and
her seamanship, in repairing damage to the rig-
ging during the height of an emotional storm, will
help to keep her green in the memory of music-
lovers for many years. These minor disasters
have their advertising uses. .

Woods and Fraser, an average comedy-
sketch pair, are the only new people Sydney
Tivoli has to offer this week. The kindest thing
that can be Said about their sketch, “ A Warm
Reception,” is that it is a cheerful trifle. The
Morris Cronin jmrgling co. supplies the largest
turn of the bill ; Graeie Grahame scores heavily
with the race-week audience ; the stylishly-garbed
Barnes and West make a clatter with their feet'
that sounds like several dozen people doing some-
thing useful for their living ; the Newman model
aeroplane flies round and round in a business-like
way ; and Tom Dawson makes humorous remarks,
accompanied by 'music. Olga Grey, the Quealys,
and the Australian Gold Diggers are amongst
those present.

Last Sunday night, conductor De Gfoen
massed his great band in the Glaciariurn, and, for
the benefit of the family of one of his bands-
men who recently died, gave one of the
'finest instrumental performances heard in
Sydney. Probably no more ambitious pro-
gramme was ever undertaken in the city.
It included the overture to “ Tannhauser,”
“Les Beaux Pigeons,” the famous Hungarian
Rhapsody No. 1 (Liszt), and the majestic 1812
Fantasie overture in its entirety—a performance
rarely attempted. For the last-named piece a
perfect set of church bells, supplied by the John
Danks firm, was used. One of these bells,
weighing 7cwt., was specially cast at the firm’s
Melbourne house, and its accuracy of tone was
communicated to the Sydney house by telephone.
That is to say, the big bell was tolled
in the Melbourne factory, the telephones were
connected, and the note travelled clearly and
distinctly over the 582| miles of country. It was
a record in bell-tolling. Also, the audience that
heard the big fellow in the Glaciariurn was about
a record for the house—which was more important,
in view of the object.
* * * *
“Tom Jones,” the new Clarke-Meynell
production at Melbourne Royal, differs from the
'George Edwardes family of musical comedies and
operas as widely as “The Arcadians” does,
but it differs in a different way. For even a
superficial resemblance to Edward German’s
opera one must look back to the well-remembered
“Dorothy” and the less-known “My Lady
Molly.” These had something .of the 18th cen-
tury English atmosphere in music and story, from
which “Tom Jones” draws breath of life. The
melodies, costumes and bucolicism of the piece
are fairly suggestive of that three-bottle-nosed
time when the unsober country Squire invariably
upbraided his daughter as an undutiful wench,
and inevitably coughed up a blessing and a dowry
for the young woman when his forgiveness came
due. Possibly an acquaintance with Fielding’s
novel is essential to a warm liking for the opera,
and certainly it is necessary to the understanding
of the fragile plot; for Jones’s standing in the
Western household is not made plain, nor is the
dialogue very explanatory on other points.

GREY HAIR MAKES YOUR FACE
LOOK ,OLD.
A young face looks old if it is surrounded with
grey, faded or dead-looking hair. Allen’s
Mexican Walnut Stain will make frorii 10 to 20
years difference in your appearance if you are
grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly harm-
less, and easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth or younger
y^ars.
:• Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain is not to, be
confounded with the common or garden hjair
restorers,” which deceive nobody but the djeluded
users. This unique preparation is offered as a
superior stain, and its composition has been
arrived at only after a long series of experiments.
No injurious effect will be produced, provided the
simple directions are followed out —it is quite free
from Lead, Mercury or Sulphur. It is equally
suitable for ladies’ hair or hair of the bpard or
moustache, and will not wash off or stain the linen.

Nevertheless, the public that now meets Thomas
and Sophia for the first time should be tempted
to call again for the sake of the music, i.e., as
many of the public as can be struck by music
which isn’t thrown at them in brickbat form.
“ Tom Jones” has the melodies which charm the
ear, but do not tickle it. The airs are not carried
away in the hearer’s head to be whistled next
morning, but the effect of them is borne in mind
as a matter for future consideration.
* * * *
Although the “ book ” of the opera seems
to assume that everybody has read the original,
none of the old novelist’s incidents is closely
adapted. The giddiness of Lady Bellaston is
bluntly indicated, whilst the fact that Mr. Jones
5 ? n w^. en be wasn’t existing on somebody
6 i S ’ s gassed over. Two of the Princi-
pe characters —the Seagrims, who figured in
Buchanun’s “Sophia”—are left out of this story.
Blifil and Squire Allworthy are empty forms, and
Benjamin Partridge is a mere low-comedy
meddler instead of the human character, “faith-
ful, shrewd and childlike in simplicity,” that
litheradge played in the Brough-Boucicault
production of yore. Moreover, his interfer-
®nce B 1 Tom Jones’s affairs is not accounted
for. The opera has three acts. The first is in
Squire Western’s grounds, where Goatcher’s
pretty scenery lias a rather Australian appearance;
the second, an old hospitable inn where Sophia
finds Jones in company with Lady Bellaston, and
Squire Western comes in pursuit of his daughter
and is phlebotomised by Partridge ; the third, at
Ranelagh Gardens, where the trouble ends rather
abruptly. Each act is brightly spectacular; the
first is the strongest in musical numbers, and has
the best finale. Of irrelevant variety business
there is none at all. This opera maintains the
old-time manner even better than “-Dorothy ”
did, and its lapses into illegitimate comedy are
confined to the representative funny man.
* * * *
The performance is admirable in several
places. Miss Winifred O’Connor, the new prima
donna, is a tall and pretty picture of maiden
modesty and refinement. Her acting is quiet
without being cold, and, as a pure soprano
vocalist, she is the best that we have heard in comic
opera for years. Her artistic singing is the
feature of the proceedings throughout. Miss
Gilliam, whose sauciness is as refined as the
other lady s demureness, lets herself go .for all
she is worth in the soubrette, part of Sophia’s
maid. Percy Clifton puts a lot of droll force
into his Squire Western; three bumpkin
flunkey characters, with Tom Walls in the
foremost of them, are honestly played and
sung; a fully obnoxious Blifil is supplied
by Charles Stone ; the Allworthy (Fred
England) is a model of eighteenth century
virtue in a full-bottomed wig; and among the
people who have very little to do, Miss Kavanagh
is conspicuously genial in doing it. The repre-
hensible Lady Bellaston is treated in a cheerful,
modern way by Miss Jennie Pollock, whose airs
and graces seem to have come fresh off the Mel-
bourne Block. Cromwell, as Partridge, does his
best to be funny in a weak part; and Thorley, as
an ardent, impetuous, lady-killing young lover, is
the same calm, unconvincing Harold as usual.
With him as its underdone hero, the show’s
weakest spot is in the centre.
“THE WINNING
TICKET," AT
MELBOURNE
KING'S.
Edwin Campbell as
Mr. Moggs, of
Moggs's Dairy Farm;
also owner of the
'orse Kookaburra.
Bert Bailey's idea
of a reporter.
“The Whip,” at Her Majesty’s (Mel-
bourne), looks fit to run for the life of J. C.
Williamson, in a horsey way of speak-
ing. The noble animal, and the people
who want it to win, or are bent on blight-
ing its career, continue to do everything the
drama expects. The nice-spoken young Earl
loses his memory ; the nice girl still believes him
innocent of the charge of matrimony which the
glaring adventuress brings against him; the sin-
ful Captain persists in chuckling at his own
cynicism ; the virtuous jockey always strikes
the right note of brotherly feeling when he
finds that the inference he drew from his
sister’s alarmed expression was the right
one; Joe Kelly, the bookmaker, gets taken down
for sixty thousand of the best every evening at
the same time; the garrulous horse-trainer with
the gratuitous laugh is still followed, even unto
the Waxworks, by the deep-toned widow with
the nautical, rolling gait; and the loud, out-
spoken Kid is an ornament to the Chamber of
Horrors as before. Also, the horse-box collapses
from nervous shock every time the fatal engine
biffs it on the buffers.
** * *
The foregoing remarks, somewhat altered
to suit the case, would apply to “The Winning
Ticket,” now in its fourth week at the King’s.

After Friday his legs will be a dream of the past
in Melbourne, and, seeing that he has always
been a hero on the stage and a thoroughly re-
spectable citizen off it, his final remarks will be
regretfully received by a large audience. In the
meantime, he is appearing this (Thursday) after-
noon as the hero of a benefit matinee in which all
the theatrical companies in Melbourne will take
part. On Saturday comes the lately-constructed
Williamson comedy co. with “ The Brass Bottle.”

Calve will be back in Melbourne on
Saturday for one last final concert, which is to be
located in the Exhibition Building at prices cal-
culated to attract a great multitude to that vast
structure. At the Town Hall, where the adorable
Dolores has been and sung and conquered, nothing
is just about to happen; but the Athenaeum Hall
is under engagement to the Corricks for 14 nights
from Saturday, the Bth.

There are one or two pictures at West’s
Palace, Melbourne, that people should include in
their mental diet. There is the story of “What
the Daisy Said,” showing the birth and death of a
bucolic idyll. There is the yarn of the making of
wine. There also is the life romance of a fish,
with the creature followed from the ovum to the
frying-pan. This series stuns the most thought-
less observer. When he sees the change from the
egg to the frisky fishlet, he beholds a feat of
creation which leaves him incapable of anything
more connected than a string of interjections.

“ The Third Floor Back ” hit Adelaide in
a tender place. It is not a erreat play, but it is
out of the ordinary gropve, and scores accordingly.
Lang as the Stranger is impressive. Adelaide
notes that he is singularly like Paris Nesbit, the
local K.C., in appearance. One can, however,
imagine the part played more simply, less unctu-
ously. The- Stranger seems to be merely every-
body’s better self incarnated ; but. just as one is
taking this as obvious, and setting down to
managerial advertisement the suggestion that he
is Someone Else, two of the women suddenly
offer to kneel to him—and an open verdict has to
be returned. The play will be remembered for
its elaborate affectation of the existence of the
stage’s fourth wall—the one on the side of the
audience; the gas-chamber in “Sherlock
Holmes” is one of the few precedents
for this. Among a crowd of good actors
stand out Styan as the Jew and Robert-
shaw as the shady Major; the rest play cleverly,
but these are just what they are supposed to be.
The author, by the way, utterly fails to enforce
the moral of that Hebrew’s conversion. He was
running a bit of Irish land as a hopeless silver-
mine.' Converted, he turns it to its natural
use. But an Australian audience takes the
offering of a silver-mine as a dairy-farm to be
merely another bit of reckless company-floating.
The co. is now unravelling the singularly
unpleasant question of the paternity of Pete’s
baby. The Kremo family is still crowding the
Tivoli. Vaude and Verne have some clever local
patter. Ted Kalman is a real artist; that is, he
can make the house rock with laughter at any-
thing he says. It even rocks when he claims to
be “The father of four ; at least, I think so.” In
the writer’s opinion this, while obviously vulgar,
is in no way funny, and rbcks ought to be thrown
at the singer.
One Tom Moore is the latest stormy
petrel on the coast. For years Moore was skipper
ofone'of the China boats, and could come down
through Torres Strait in the dark. Recently,
however, he gave up ploughing Farmer Neptune’s
fields as a regular thing, and decided to cultivate
Torres Strait in a pilot’s jacket. The Torres
Strait pilots, however, are a close corporation,
licensed by the Queensland Government, and are
reported to have a good thing on. , After a bit
of a battle with their association, Moore deter-
mined to fight them, and, openly defying them,
piloted a steamer through the Strait. Arriving
off Thursday Island, the nautical non-unionist
learned that quite a crowd of persons were wait-
ing to point out in a very unpleasant manner the
irregularity of the proceedings, and that these
same individuals intended to arrest the ship on a
charge of being illegally at large or something.
Moore, however, kept carefully outside the port
limits until a compromise was arrived at, whereby
theship was permitted to sail without a stain on her
character while he submitted to arrest and a £lO
fine. But Moore is not done with ; he is going to
float the case into the civil courts, and the legal
status of the Torres Strait pilots will be challenged
in a hurricane of horsehair.
The president of the Baptist Union of
Victoria last week told a Sydney audience how,
whilst acting as secretary or something of a re-
ligious society, he once prayed to the Lord for
£lOO to pay off an overdraft of £24, which
threatened to double itself by the time the next
meeting came round. The £lOO didn’t arrive
promptly, and the good man’s faith began
to wilt; in fact, he reduced his demand
to the £24 that was actually required. When
he seemed about to curl up altogether, a
letter from a devout firm was : handed him, enclos-
ing a cheque for the full amoupt. (Loud applause.)
The pious narrator finished his story neatly in
this wise: “That was lovqlv, wasn’t it? I do
praise the Lord. It came just in the nick of time,
as if the Lord had said, ■ You asked for that
hundred, and you ought not to Ipive dropped
to twenty-four.” The ordinary sinper, in the
same circumstances, would have interpreted the
message thus : “You asked for a lot more than
you actually needed ; it would-'have been more
graceful to have asked for £5O, which sum would
have covered the debt. You might remember
that you are not saving all the sinners for me, and
that I have use for all my money. However, here
is the £lOO. I have purposely kept you waiting
in order that you might think hard before you
again asked me for an excessive amount.” The
real moral of the story seems to be that, when
asking the Lord for money, one should pray in a
loud voice whilst a rich and generous parishioner
is in the vicinity. One can even imagine the pru-
dent petitioner sending round one of the faithful
to pinch the rich parishioner hard if he seemed to
be dozing.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The original Drury Lane production of “The Whip”
included three actors well known to this country, one of
them an expatriated Australian. Cyril Keightley, who
graduated in George Eignold’s co., and went, to England
many years ago, was the tall, cool villain; Basil Gill
formerly with Wilson Barrett, played the curate ; and
Bucklaw took the part he is now filling in the William-
sonian production. Bucklaw has now arrived at a
grandfatherly character. The middle time he came to
Australia he was the Duke of Athens in “Midsummer
Night’s Dream ” and Jacques in “As You Like It”; the
first time (which was more than 20 vears ago) he came as
the gallant hero of “The Pointsman ” and other melo-
dramas, for which the “Firm "imported a full company.
A remarkable coincidence crops up in connection with
Tom Jones,” at Melbourne Royal. When Courtneidge
produced the opera in London he had Ambrose Manning
for Squire Western and Dora ltignold for Lady Bellastori.
Manning is just now playing in “The Whip,” at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.), iliid Miss Rignold will be appearing at
the Princess’s on Saturday in “The Brass Bottle.”
“D.”: Curious how the big Australian firms strike
similar subjects for stage presentation. Margaret Anglin,
on behalf of the Williamson people, played Katherine to
Kolker’s Petrueliio, whereupon Clarke-Meynell’s Oscar
Asohe appeared as Petruchio to the Kate of Miss Bravton.
“The Red Mill” at J.C.W.’s Theatre Royal practically
made a dead heat of it with “ The Hook of Holland ” at
Clarke’s Criterion. Both shows starred a windmill
the action of both took place in the Netherlands, and
in other respects they bore a powerful family like-
ness. Asche presented. “Count Hannibal,” which dealt
with the massacre of St. Bartholomew. The Firm imme-
diately riposted with “Henry of Navarre,” which
supplied another aspect of the great mediaeval yellow
and green trouble. Now, Clarke-Meynell having mate-
rialised with “The Arcadians,” a sporting play contain-
ing a real live racehorse and a racecourse scene, Bil-
anderson follows with a sporting show, containing another
live racehorse and another racecourse scene ; and J.C. W.
follows with “ The Whip,” which likewise stars a race-
horse and a racecourse scene. Incidentally, an Ascot
Gold Cup is being burgled nightly at Bilanderson’s
Chance of a Lifetime ” entertainment, and at William-
son’s “Our Miss Gibbs.” Is it just coincidence or sheer
blank unoriginality ?
“Sceneshifter”: In 1889 William Walshe, just dead
was one of the leading tenors with Martin Simonsen’s
Opera Co. that came to a dead stop in Dunedin (ML)
The show opened on a Saturday with “ Maritana,”'and
Monday’s Otago Daily Times had a crushing notice. On
Monday “ Carmen ” was played. Between the acts vola.
tile Martin came out and addressed the audience. Hold-
ing a copy of the paper in his hand, he said that that
would be the last night of the season. He added
that the reporter of the Times had already been
shown out of the theatre. The paper’s , notice
had robbed 40 artists of their bread-and butter, etc
Martin’s angry bow-wow was applauded. Previous to
the overture the pressman had been hustled hurriedly
down the dress-circle stairs by Harcourt Lee, Walshe and
a few others. Evil days at once fell on the show ; from
that night it started to break up. Some got back at
once to Australia; but Walshe, Frank Sceats, Ethel
Muckay and Florence Seymour formed a troupe and
toured the “smalls,” expounding “The Bohemian Girl”
and other operas with a co. of six or eight. Yet Simon-
sen’s combination deserved better luck. It had, as leading
baritones, Fred England and Warwick Gainor (who came
to an untimely end in New York, his body being found
chopped to pieces); also Percy Shannon (tenor) and
Florence Seymour (contralto); with Florence’s hus-
band, Erskine Scott, as representative. Tom Pollard who
h id not yet struck the lucrative vein of Lilliputian opera
was the stag -manager, and mummed in minor rdles’
Tom, who started as a fiddler with the original Pollards
(1880 to 1885), is now running picture-shows in Grey-
mouth (M.L.). His career as an operatic nianager ran
from 1892 to 1909 or thereabouts.
“L.H.P.”: This grand opera season could be made a
bit grander and more interesting by the inclusion of
“ Mignon ” and Massenet’s “Manon”—the lgtter de-
scribed by Melba as “ a dainty piece of Dresden, china.”
Bel Sorel includes these in her repertoire, and has u arbled
in them abroad. M assenet’s opera would be a novelty
here, and so would the work by Puccini on the
same subject. A fine English version of the Frenchman’s
opera was done by the Carl Rosa Co. as far back as 1886
with Barton McGuckin (here with Albanilin the tenor
role, and Marie Roze as Manon. Marian Burton, the
original Australian “ Paul Jones ” of 1890 in the Musgrove-
Nellie Stewart production, was also in the "cast
Puccini, whose “Butterfly and “Bohfeme” we
know, also turned the Abbe Prevost’s novel into
an opera, and showed a procession of courtesans
being shipped from Fiance to New Orleans—a cheerful
subject that might appeal to the baldheads. Massenet
(who, by the way, is the 21st child of his parents) has
never had an opera done in Australia. He has composed
Over a score, and Bel Sorel has warbled in his “ Werther ”
“Cendrillon,” and “Manon.” In Ainbroise Thomas’s
. Mig-non something* might be done if the management
could rope in a good contralto for the r6le of Frederick
last done here by Madame Jenson, at the same theatre in
1901. This accomplished, it could with Bel So’rel
(Mignon), A. Crane (Lothario), and R. Roberts (Wilhelm
Meister) put on a fairly reasonable interpretation of the
opera that contains the famous gavotte and “Knowest
Thou that Dear Land.”
“ Kaitangata”; Truly some players are evergreen.
There s Priscilla Verne, now headlining at aSvdney hall '
along with a young. American. It is every day of 30 years
since I first saw Priscilla, who was then a slip of a <>irl
married to the late Charlie Hugo, the black-faced cornel
dian. A while back she went to America at a time of life
when most serio-chronics have retired hurt, as they say
at cricket; and soon she was running her own show over
the surface of California and the north-western States
Now, with a new partner, she’s hitting the boys in the
place where she hit their fathers, and with much the same
sort of business.
“ Pollio ”: Lydia Yeamans-Titus, it turns out, is a
Sydney girl, and owns about the pluckiest and- liveliest
mother on the stage to-day. Mrs. Annie Yeanianfs, who
is still appearing in musical farce in New lork, talked
the other day, it being the 65th anniversary of herfiist
appearance. She made her first bow to a Sydney audi-
ence as the child in “The Farmer's Laughter,” in 1845.
Then she took to circus life— La Sylphide, Equestrienne
Extraordinary— and wandered’“ through the wilds of
Australia. The show was Henry Benton’s, and the route
any old place that Ben ton liked, hisguide being a crude map
and compass.” The years 1857-9 saw her again in Sj'dney,
married, and plating with a stock company. Then she
joined G. B. VV. Lewis’s Hippodrome for a tour round
“Java and the islands of the Pacific,” got stranded in
Shanghai, toured China and Japan with Eisley (inventor
of the Risley act, of which the Kremos give a glorified
version), wandered over the South Pacific with someone
else’s circus, and finally got to San Francisco just in time
to hear that President Lincoln had been assassinated.
The rest is America, from variety halls to Augustirr Daly.
She and Mrs. G. B. VV.—who seems to be just as lively
and immortal—ought to give the pampered darlings of
to-dy’s musical comedy a lecture on working for your
living. What a contrast the plucky pair would be to the
modern stage favorite—to the ladies, for instance, who
consulted their agent about the number of pairs of boots
they ought to bring to Australia, in pase none should be
procurable in that far-off wilderness!
Charlotte Hemming gave a dramatic recital at ’Melb.
Masonic Hall the other night—the first, it was said, for
her own benefit since her return from Britain, two or
three years ago. As an actress in scenes from Shaks-
peare, or comediettas, Miss Hemming shows a lack of
stage training, and is only notable for her likable per-
sonality. But that personality is so bright and genial
that in a duologue with even an inflexible male amateur
she makes the scene interesting. In a “character”
monologue, where her sense of humor gets full play, she
is a Charlotte in 10,000. Her way is that of the natural
entertainer rather than the experienced actress, and if
her drollery were more pointed than it is, she would be
less funny.
“0.K.”: Thomas Beecham, a capitalist with a box of
pills rampant on his coat-of-arms, has been making some
interesting operatic ventures. During 12 weeks at Her
Majesty’s (London) he staged 12 operas, only two of them
by British composers, but all of them in English. The
marked feature of the season was the comparative
superiority of the principals, who sang in their native
tongue. They warbled with so much more facility and
expression than their broken-accented colleagues. This
month Beecham is to start a season of opera, lasting
until Christmas, at Covent Garden. Several of the
works will be new to England, and all of them, seemingly,
are to be sung in English by English. It is beginning
to be understood that a translation of foreign opera,
rendered by vocalists who can do full justice to the trans-
lation, is a more consistent performance than that of
(say) “Madam Butterfly'’' by J. C. Williamson’s co.,
wherein Bel Sorel, a Frenchwoman, is associated with a
number of Australians and an Italian or two. As for the
essential falseness of sentiment in a completely English
performance of “Laßohfeme,” it is not more false than
a performance of the German story of “Faust,” trans-
lated from the French and sung by Spaniards as Italian
opera. German words come melodiously enough from
German lips, and not even a Verdi opera, given by
Italians, is so harmonious in effect as a Wagner opera,
wholly German in character and story, sung' by Germans
in German. Puccini’s Bohemians are French folk ; and
what the dickens did that modern Italian composer really
know of Americans among the Japs when he imagined
“Madam Butterfly'?” After all, the Germans do well
to swear by their Wagner, the man who breathed the
very spirit of the matter he took in hand.
“ Gordon Inglis ” (from London) : Managers here, on
the whole, did well during 1909-j.O (the iheatrieal year
starts with September). Forty'-nirie new plays of two or
more acts were produced, 10 musical plays, 26 one-act
shows and four pantomimes. There were 38 revivals.
“ Our Miss Gibbs ’’ and “The Arcadians ” are still going
strong in their second year, while other good runs were
put up by “The Blue Bird” (274 nights), “The Brass
Bottle (244), “Don ”(208), “ Arsfene Lupin ”(199), “The
Little Damozel ” (191), “The Balkan Princess” (176),
“Smith” (168), “The House of Temperley” (161),
“Alias Jimmy Valentine” (150). “The Whip,” “The
Dollar Princess,” “Tantalising Tommy” and “The
Bad Girl of the Family” all have a kick left.
In revivals Fred Terry and Julia Neilson added 154
nights to the vast total of “The Scarlet Pimpernel,” and
George Alexander, after some unprofitable ventures, has
found financial peace in Oscar Wilde’s “ The Importance
of Being Earnest.” Shakspeare has had a slump. In
1908-9 the total number of performances of the Immortal
Bill’s plays was 213, and in 1909-10 140—“ King L«ar”
(35), “Merchant of Venice” (33), “ Richard III.” (28), and
“ The Merry Wives of Windsor ’’ (14) being the favorites.
Edward Branscombe is “Limited” these days. No
longer does he lead the Westminster choir cherubs by
the hand ; his business now is with “ The Jesters,” who
will open their summer season at Arcadia, on the St.
Hilda (Vic.) Esplanade, on Oct. 24. Branscombe has
brought out some people from the Cold Place, including
Cuthbert Rose and Herbert Walton, comedians ; and
most of last season’s “Jesters” will also be in this
season’s programme.
“ Earl.v Door ”: About the most harrowing thing in
vaudeville I have seen, of late, is a turn in which a small,
fat-faced hoy in a white duck suit and straw hat makes
stage love to a small girl dressed as a milkmaid. The girl
is fairly competent, and unobjectionable from an artistic
point of view ; but the boy is clumsy and sings fervently
through his nose ; also, he has only about three gestures,
and he works his arms like a semaphore till the onlooker
feels impelled to tear up his stall arid fling it at him.
When the time arrives to dance, the wretched lad staggeis
to and fro, waggles his legs in a disconsolate way 7, and
knocks hjs knees together, and altogether looks so ner-
vous and unhappy that I wonder what sort of people
they are who push such children into the limelight and
urge them to stumble through their absurd .turns.
“P.A.W.”: Yackandandah begins to feel better about
JamesJ. Jeffries. Soon after the Big Clout the'councillors
of the desultory village with the vast name staggered the
surrounding scrub by deciding that thepublie hall should
not he desecrated by stoush pictures, i But since then a
reaction has set in, and the council has upset the pre-
vious arrangement; so Yack is once more at liberty to
wipe its hoofs upon the bag doormat and walk in and
witness any show it darned well chooses.
The Cherniavski brothers are back in London after
their world’s tour. Little Michael with the ’cello gets
the best notices now. Jan and Leo are no longer
children, and various papers remark in a pained voice
that they must now be judged by grown-up standards,
and that, from this point of view, they tend to rely
rather on sensational and fireworky effects than on
musicianly 7 qualities.
“Gordon Inglis”( London): Beerbehm Tree is experi-
menting with theatre time-table reform ; at his recent
revival of “Henry VIII.,” the curtain was raised at 7
p.m., and finally lowered about 10 p.m. So far, the only
people I have met who have had a good word for the ex-
periment are the press critics. It gives them a chance
to write their notices before the stampede and “copy ”-
slaughter of the early morning hours.

The Dart, a vessel which was traded to
N. S. Wales by his Britannic Majesty when that
gentleman had no further use for it, is likely to
shortly close its career as a training ship, whereon
the boys of the Sobraon are given nautical ex-
perience on the deep sea. The Dart is an un-
wieldy old packet, and must have a crew of 40
youths to work it properly. The Government
requires an agreement from the parents of the
ineorrigibles sent to the Sobraon before they
can be used on the Dart, and the great majority
of parents refuse this permission. So the
Dart is mostly engaged in growing barnacles
and reaping the seaweed in Sydney Harbor.
Further, the State system of dealing with refrac-
tory youth has been radically altered of late, and
the Sobraon itself is half empty, and hasn’t any
young tars to spare to man its consort. So it has
been gently hinted to Jimmy Hogue that he
might ask George V. to take back his Dart as a
compensation for the Dreadnought which Allen
Taylor mislaid. Jimmy Hogue had better make
up his mind and announce it quickly, because
after the 14th his mind won’t matter.
NOT QUITE HOPELESS.
COLDLY ANGRY PERSON : “ You're a liar, a thief,
an idiot, a scoundrel, a fool —in fact, there

MILD PERSON: "Yes, but otherwise I'm all
right, ain't I?”
Tenders are invited in Melbourne for the
purchase, as a going concern, of the old prison
hulk Success; and if
Fisher’s “confiscatory”
taxation proposals
haven’t quite banished
sentiment, Mr. Private
Enterprise ought to be
stirred a bit by the news
that this, to him, in-
teresting link with the
past still exists. The
Success is the sole sur-
vivor of the fleet of
merchant ships, five iu
number, which the
Vic. Government
found it necessary
to buy soon after
the gold discov-
eries, in order to
supplement the
quod accommoda-
tion ashore. If the
ribs of the old tub
could but speak,
even the ghost of
Hamlet’s father
could not unfold a
more blood-freezing
tale. Built at Moul-
mein sometime in the
early years of last cen-
tury, the Success, dur-
ing its earlier stages,
was a passenger-carry-
ing East Indiaman. It
made its first trip to
Australia in 1849 with
immigrants for Mel-
bourne, and two years
later again showed up
in Hobson’s Bay with a
similar freight. That
time the golden bait
caught officers and crew ;
and soon afterwards the
abandonedship was bought
for the restraint of Mr. P.
E. The disciplinary methods
brought to bear by big Jack Price
quickly won for the Success pre-
eminence as a floating Sheol. Price’s
murder in 1857 brought matters to
a climax ; and, with the exception of
the Success, all the prison hulks were
auctioned, a condition being that
they were to be broken up. The
specially-spared Success was used by the Go-
vernment for a while as a training ship for
refractory boys, and then fell once more-into
the hands of Mr. P. E., who converted it into
a kind of waxworks show, first in Australia and
for some years past for the edification of J. Bull.
What can he done with it now isn’t clear ; proba-
bly the syndicate has an idea that Capital, being
driven out by oppressive legislation from every
country on earth, will buy it and anchor it some-
where as a sort of Ark of Refuge from the new
Deluge of Socialistic legislation.

Adelaide, already the best paved city in Aus-
tralia, is now making its footpaths out of the con-
tents of its rubbish-boxes and ash-barrels. It has
got past the stage at which it hurls the city refuse
into a furnace and just burns the stuff ; it has got
past the stage even at which the steam produced
is converted into electric current. At its new
works the current is achieved all right, but in
addition the clinker from the furnaces is made
into footpath slabs, and another fragment of the
energy is used up in working a disinfector to
which any citizen may take his goods and chattels
after there have been mumps or other non-paying
guests in the house. It is all ruinous, blood-
curdling Socialism, of course; but, somehow, the
monster is never recognised when he gets into
actual operation.
“ J.G.” : The mania Victorian trains have
for smashing themselves on sleepers
and earthworks surprises no one
who has had anything to do with
the upkeep of the lines. The
rail-spreading business has been
expected for years. I pointed
out in The Bulletin in 1908
that Tait and Co.’s cheap and
nasty habit of putting two big
engines to draw trains of about
half a mile in length was play-
ing Harry, sen., with the lines,
and that wrecks were bound to
come as a result. It is a
usual thing to see a couple of
monster engines coming down
the slope of the Dividing
Range into the Wallan sta-
tion pulling a tremendously-
weighted goods train. After
these Juggernauts have
passed, it is the duty of
the gangers and fettlers to
tear out with the swiftness
of wild deer and examine
their lengths, especially
about curves, bridges and culverts, to see if the
lines have been pushed out of place. If they
notice anything wrong, they have to swiftly put
it right before the Sydney express or some other
passenger train comes along. Some day a part of
the line will get pushed out of place, and not
be detected before a fast express materialises, and
then —!
An infuriated citizen flew into the columns
of the Sydney Telegraph the other morning to
express his amazement and, contempt re-
garding the new regulation of Tudor, Federal
Minister for Customs, cutting out “ I have
the honor to he,” etc., from his corres-
pondence. “Why,” snorted this excited
correspondent, “why does not the great

the lowest colloquialism, ‘yours, etc.’?’
Then, having made a few other re-
marks, the letter ended with “the
lowest colloquialism”—“vours, etc.,
Sknex.”
HER MAJEST Y— WOMAN.
A correspondent of one of the dailies
brought obloquy on his head, the other day, by
remarking that Londoners ran after the triviali-
ties of life. When he wrote, the great dailies
were brimming over with details of the Crippen
case, to the exclusion of the German peril, local
politics, Himperial concerns, and all else. When
the Crippen case lulled, London seethed with a
new topic. The public eye was centred on Argyle-
road, West Ealing, which is a remote London
suburb. Here a row of the usual suburban
character raged between one Jenkins and a
builder named Knight. Jenkins, who says he
has “ had several nervous breakdowns,” owns a
piotor-driven piano-player, on which he per-
sistently grinds out “The Poor Blind Boy.”
Knight, by way of protest, installed a gramo-
phone on his front window-sill, and hired German
bands and barrel-organs to perform outside
Jenkins’s abode. After a while, the two met
at “the little shop of Mrs. Cackett, at the
corner of Argyle-road,” and a syphon was
smashed and Jenkins suffered “an abra-
sion on the back of the hand.” Sum-
monses and cross-summonses then
began to whirl round. To this
drearily commonplace affair the
London dailies have been devoting
columns. On August 23 the Daily
Mail provided, in addition to a de-
tailed account of the trouble, half a
page of photographs showing (1)
Jenkins, (2) his cats, (3) his piano,
(4) Knight, an emaciated Calamity in
aii immense bowler hat, who was>shown
discussing Jenkins with the reporters. It is
essentially the stuff which appeals to the intellect
and touches the great heart of the British public.
And it suggests—even if one had not Mafficking
Day to go on—that the Briton is not the Cool
Follower-up of the Things that Matter he used
to be. There are even doubts as to whether he
ever really was that sort of person.

What exactly is the price of a church foot-
baller? Recently two church teams were to kick
the windy sphere in Melbourne, but, before the
game started, one player noticed three of his mates
in close confabulation with a mysterious stranger.
He demanded the meaning of it, and learned that
they had received 2s. 6d. each to run stiff, and
had been entrusted with treasure to the amount
of 7s. 6d. with which to stiffen three other foot-
ballers. As one of the men who was to turn dog
for 2s. 6d. was a crack player, who had been
specially hired at the powerful remuneration of
ss. to knock the other club out, it was felt that
the square thing hadn’t been done. But what,
exactly, is the price of a church footballer ?
The case of Boris Senkovitch, otherwise
Vitchman, and his friend Eismund is calculated
to supply much deafening mouth-ammunition to
the embattled army of Judkins. They were
Russians, and very young. Senkovitch came of a
middling sort of family which drank (possibly
shandygaff), and Eismund of a wealthy family
which, apparently, took its food in a dry state—
at all events, its refreshments are not mentioned.
They both read the works of that eminent writer,
Deadwood Diokovitch, and longed to be pirates.
That was how it came to pass that two young
Russians, who spoke no English, came to dwell
in a tent beside the Darling, near Bourke.
They had guns and an English dictionary,
and were resolved that the local kangaroo would
not eat them without such a struggle as the
animal would remember even on its death-bed.
Then Boris Senkovitch (whose family drank)
started back to Melbourne alone, and later the
body of Eismund (who had money) was found
floating in the Darling tied up in canvas. If it
was Boris who killed him, his actions were a
grievous reflection upon the writings of his
favorite author, Deadwood Diokoff. That person
lacks the scientific mind and never goes into de-
tails ; so the assassin hadn’t the faintest idea
what a vast amount of weight it requires to keep
a body down. He tied tuppence to it, wheteas
he should have tied two kedge anchors and a
tombstone.
When the deceased came to the surface of
events, suspicion, of course, fell on his friend
Senkovitch, and if the latter wanted to escape he
hadn’t a ghost of a chance. A dead body floats
in all languages, while the live youth knew no
language save his own, and couldn’t ask which
was the other side of the street without the aid of
an interpreter. A man who knew Italian or
Greek niight pull through unobserved in itn Aus-
tralian city, by asking questions in fish-shops
and banana-warehouses, especially if he selected
places where the bananas were bad ; but a man
armed only with Russian might, in the matter of
conspicuousness, almost as well be an ancient
Egyptian trying to pawn a pyramid for board and
lodging. But whatever is the ultimate fate of
Boris Senkovitch, otherwise Vitchman, the stu-
pendous regiment of Judkins is dead sure to make
the country very tired with lengthy dissertations
upon the alleged fact that his parents were a
tanked pair in Muscovy, where the Muscovy duck
comes from. Yet it is quite possible that the
confused youth was wrongly translated. Possibly
what he said was that he led a miserable, ne-
glected youth, while his parents were away at
anti-vodka meetings.

From the Patent Agent’s draftsman
Oh yes, the Boss has his troubles ; but what about me?
After all, he only has to listen to the rhapsodies of in-
fatuated inventors, and write their specifications, r
to put their jim-jams into visible shape on paper. Words
can be made to conceal a lot of absence of thought, but
drawings are more graphic.
The other day a lady inventor blew in—there are plenty
of them—and, said she : “ Mine is such a lovely 'dea ; I
have invented a combination perambulator, cradle and
baby’s chair. If you will just draw it for me, I shall be
so much obliged.” .
“ Certainly,” I replied ; “ if you will describe it.
“ Why, but I have just told you—it’s a perambulator,
cradle and baby’s chair ”
“That’s so ; but how do you do the trick ?”
She looked surprised. “That’s just what I want you
to draw,” she said. “ I have supplied the idea; I

Well, there is no sense in turning good money away ;

‘ Loy R.” : The other day in Perth I met
a different sort of infant from the ones the Three
Holy Children saw in Sj'dney. He was holding
up the verandah post of a pub and weeping
bitterly. “ What are you howling for? ” I asked.
Like the infant inebriates in Sydney he wept his
age in my ear (he was 18), and then snuffled: “Me
father went in there a long while ago, and he
hasn’t come out yet.” “ Why don’t you go in and
bring him out?” I asked. “Because I might get
lost if I went in there.” He fairly bellowed this
out. At the sight of such awful misery I fell on
his neck and mingled my tears with his, and soon
his moaning ceased.

Bricks have been flying in Berlin as they
haven’t flown since the heftv davs of 1848. Pos-
sibly Kaiser Wilhelm, now aged 51, isn’t
quite the mailed fist he was, or possibly
his people aren’t quite what they
were; anyhow, the mob seems to
have turned Berlin upside down,
and put a clod on top of it.
What the Berliners really
want is a decent franchise.
As German citizens, they
are fairly satisfied, for
though the members of the
German Upper House are
nominated by the State Go-
vernments, the Lower House
rests on universal suffrage, or
a fair imitation thereof. But as
Prussians, the Berliners are mad.
The Prussian Parliament is an
amazing animal. The Upper House
consists of royalties, princes,
nobles, royal nominees and the bur-
gomasters of the big cities. The
Lower House is elected. A voter
must be a male Prussian, aged 25
or more, and must pay taxes to
qualify for the municipal suffrage.
The voters don’t choose the mem-
bers of the Lower House; they
choose a sort of college of electors,
and it chooses the members. The
original voters are divided into
three classes: (1) a few very big
taxpayers who pay one-third of the
taxes: (2) a larger number of the
next biggest taxpayers—enough to
represent another third of the taxes
paid ; (3) the great multitude of small taxpayers
who pay the final third. As these classes choose
an equal number of electors, it follows that,
though the great bulk of the male community
aged over 25 have votes, the votes of about 80 per
cent, of them don’t count for much. It is an
ingenious contrivance which looks like a liberal
suffrage and isn’t. So, last week, rocks were pass-
ing freely between the great crowd of voters
whose votes don’t count for much, and the repre-
sentatives of the Law, as manufactured by the
small crowd of voters whose votes count for a
-very great deal.
SHE DIDN’T
LOOK IT.
"Hi! Call me a police-
man, quick!”
“ But, Lor bless per, mum,
no one'll believe me!”
From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
An ancient (Sydney) landmark is now in the hands of
the demolisher. This is the quaint old building'in George-
street, opposite Jamieson-street, for many years in the
occupation of Turner and Henderson. It is of the pure
Macquarie type. Its earliest known occupants were
Levicks and Younger, dealers in “ironmongery, hard-
ware, china, glass, saddlery and fancy goods.” They were
followed by Levicks and Piper. After them came the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co., which, in these days of its
fatness, must find it hard to believe that it could ever
have squeezed into such quarters.
NEVER TOO EARLY.
THE BORE : “ One thing I have always dreaded
is that I may be buried prematurely."
THE BORED: “How could you ?”
A Ballarat girl by the name of Jones is
resting from the alleged effects of one of the usual
awful assaults. Miss Jones, who works in a local
drapery, is said to have been seized by no less
than two males. She was on a balcony at the rear
of the shop, when the monsters bound and gagged
her; forced her to sip some noxious draught;
then tapped her on her thoughts with a sandbag.
Baldly that is the whole story of what happened
to Miss Jones; there are other details, but
they are shrouded in haze. The detectives,
so far, have learnt that the sandbag found near
the persecuted heroine had been given to the lady
by a thoughtful young sister. This and other
facts, coupled with the victim’s tendency to
hysteria, have led the police to wrinkle their
brows in thought. They do not say they dis-
believe the entire yarn of Miss Jones ; but they
have returned to their regular beats with a deeper
conviction than ever that Woman is a mystery.
* * * *
In olden times, such a yarn of outrage as
that told by the Ballarat girl last week would
have sent a knight riding off with a packet of
sandwiches tied to his spear and a duly-registered
vow not to come back until he had overtaken and
slain the pair of villains. Heaven knows how
many knights squandered their lives and died far
from their homes in consequence of the yarns
spun by imaginative young women, weary to
death of checking the castle pages and waving
lily-white hands from turret windows at passing
ironmongery travellers ! The average maiden of
the Muddle Ages, when the drawbridge was up
for the night, probably confided to her chum
something like this : “ Marry, Ysobel, I tell thee
that I have now five Johnnies out on the roads
hunting ogres for me; and he that rode forth first
hath been gone five harvests and a sowing.
Heigh-ho ! I doubt me if I shall e’er behold them
again.” The palmy days of the Wild Yarn have
gone for ever. The detective, who has taken the
knight’s place, is a sorry substitute for the noble,
but fatuous hardware wanderer ; he has not the
same deep trust in human nature, and asks ques-
tions and more questions, until the bare facts are
dragged out and stand shivering for the world to
laugh at.

“ De Yid ” : Attached to pretty well every
black or brindle person of any cash tonnage at all
in this country, is something to make the good
Australian rage furiously. The something is the
white-man hanger-on. Sometimes he is a pimply
youth, who imagines that he is seeing the Orient
in all its native splendor, while he hangs on to the
arm of Mulu Singh and lives and drinks (mostly
drinks) at his expense. More often he is the old
Cambridge or Oxford man, who has sunk so deep in
shame that there are no depths beyond. Fre-
quently the hanger-on is familiar with the work-
ing of the arm of the Law through long practice in
evading it; and then he is of good value to his
muddy patron, for the average Asiatic loves the
Law as a blood brother. Any appearance in court,
even as a defendant, he looks upon as an honor.
And so the white man plays his wretched part.
It is all very reminiscent of the Dago and his
monkey; and it is a sad thing, my masters, to see
the little monkey so tremblingly eager to perform
his tricks for the Dago’s approbation.
The interesting Caulfield (Vic.) case of Had-
don v. the Rev. Frank Lynch, in which the plaintiff
sought to restrain the parson and his church
guardians from ringing an ungodly bell at ungodly
hours, drew from the defendant an admission that
some of his Lenten services are attended by no
one save himself. In fact, he is “ usually alone,”
he said, on those solemn occasions. Justice
A’Beckett wanted to know whether he addressed
himself as “dearly beloved brethren”; but the
rev. gentleman gave no direct answer. He re-
plied : “I go through the appropriate parts,”
and left it at that. The Judge, seem-
ingly, was thinking of Dean Jonathan Swift
and his little joke. Nobody but Roger
the clerk being present when Swift opened
the service, he addressed himself personally to his
hireling parishioner. “ Dearly beloved Roger,
the Scripture moveth you and me in sundry
places”—and so on to the bitter end. When he
had to implore the congregation to accompany
him to the throne of the heavenly grace, the
Dean fixed his eye on the one man and said :
“ Therefore, I pray and beseech you, Roger, being
the only one present, etc.” But the Melbourne
suburban shepherd with the horrible sheep-bell is
not much of a humorist, so the idea of confining
all his exhortations to his own particular self has
apparently not occurred to him.
•Jr * * *
Further investigation of the Caulfield
case leads one to feel even greater sympathy
for the plaintiff than he did at first. The
preacher, it seems, held a service every week-
day. A boy of 14 rang the preliminary bell
to summon the people who never came, and,
in his own words, he “rang it for all it was
worth.” According to old theory and mouldy
tradition, a certain privilege attaches to the
discordant bell which summons a congregation
on Sunday ; but the bell that summons
nobody at all on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday and Saturday seefns a sort of
vagrant disturbance. And the irreverent attitude
of the boy who threw himself on this article of
furniture like one possessed and banged it within
an inch of the adjacent citizen’s life doesn’t
arouse sympathy. He appears to be just a
common or garden boy, with no high or holy
aspirations about him.

Judkins, now ravaging N. S. Wales in the
sly-grog interest, has fallen back on the ancient
remark that “ if the money spent on liquor were
used for other purposes, every business in Sydney
would be benefited.” Now it is up to Grog to
remark that if all the hours he spends in speechi-
fying were utilised in running an auctioneering
business, Jud would be able to subscribe enormous
sums to foreign missions, and many heathen whom
Jud doesn’t even know by sight would be benefited
to the extent of at least one waistcoat button
apiece. But, instead of seizing the chance to up-
lift the coral-stranded nigger, Judkins prefers to
squander his time and talents in gratifying his
thirst for strong publicity by talking on platforms.
It is a degrading spectacle, and someone should
speak to him about it.
* * * *
Concerning one more picture show :
Coming after a long succession of individual picture
shows, the display that Bernard Hall made at the
Athenseum (Melbourne) got very little of the attention it
deserved. People who spare only a little time per annum
for going around to look at picture collections had ex-
hausted their supply of patronage before Hall put in his
claim. They consequently missed an interesting show.
The cold, forbidding art of the school teacher is masterly
in more than one respect. His nudes have human flesh
of a sort, and graceful figures, and his painting of any
sort of metal, stone or article of furniture is beautifully
truthful. One doesn’t linger lovingly in front of a
Bernard Hall picture, but one raises his hat to it. In the
largest and most artistic of the works he exhibited lately
—“ Under the Colosseum ’’—nothing seemed wanting
save an atmosphere of tragedy. The effect was strong,
but not forceful.
* * * *
Melbourne has just learned that its mid-
wives and ladies’ nurses have acquired the habit
of giving death certificateswhere newly-born in-
fants have left suddenly, and that such documents
are accepted by undertakers and cemetery authori-
ties. A little more latitude, and Melbourne will
authorise its dustmen to remove superfluous in-
fants along with the worn-out saucepans and
other encumbrances.

“1.0. R.”: “Fined £2 or a month,”
decreed Barnett, S.M., at Paddington Police
Court, Sydney, last week, when a young fellow
was found guilty of drunkenness and bad talk.
“Can I have time?” asked the culprit. “Cer-
tainly not,” replied the magistrate. On the same
day, at the Central Police Court, King, S.M.,
fined two youths £lO each or three months. “ Time
to pay?” “Certainlynot,” replied King. Now,
what is the use of sending persons to prison who
are willing to pay a fine by instalments ? A com-
mission has been sitting in England on this very
subject, and witnesses have expressed the almost
unanimous opinion that the ends of justice will
be met if a fine is paid by instalments. The
magistrates who refuse instalments often fine the
culprit savagely, for he may lose his employment;
and for that reason a magistrate, by refusing time,
really imposes an extra penalty upon a man for
his poverty.
HOW THEY BROUGHT THE POWERFUL TO
SYDNEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H,M.S. Powerful, which has been at Jervis Bay con-
valescing 1 from the mumps, returned to Sydney on Sep-
tember 30.— News item.
Wherefore does grief obtain among our salts?
Say why yon swathed and poulticed sailor halts
And, glaring in a maddened sort of way,
Cries, “ Curses on this blanky Jervis Bay ! ”
Why all that flannel? Why those vast red lumps ?
Alack ! The Flagship’s wrestling with the mumps.
Four score or more of miles along the coast,
Sydney, the Mother State’s chief pride and boast,
Lies in an anxious, undefended state.
“ Can we,” all mumble thickly, “ let it wait,
Quaking with terror, doubtless? What are mumps
Beside a fleetless city with the jumps ? ”
The hospitable mansions of the Smart
Are pleasing to the sailor’s simple heart.
He finds them not, examiue how he may,
Upon the frontages of Jervis Bay.
The local males are boors, the women frumps,
As unalluring, almost, as the mumps.
The Commonwealth’s potential port abounds
With divers gratifying sights and sounds ;
But clubs and tennis courts and racing tracks
And restaurants, and large, bright bars it lacks.
No cries are heard of: “Make it.” “Right;
“No trumps”—
Dead silence reigns, meet consort for the mumps.
Meanwhile, in Sydney, sport proceeds apace ;
People dance, motor, flock to plays and race.
And stand each other dinners, drinks and teas,
And picnic merrily beneath the trees.
What wonder that our tars are in the dumps,
With no distractions—other than the mumps !
But hark ! A battle-cry rings through the craft.
“ Shall Sydney perish ? ” eclioes fore and aft.
“ Not so ! ” all shout. Follows a hearty cheer
That does a loyal Briton good to hear.
Next, the brave words : “Up anchor ! Man the
pumps 1
And set a course for Randwick 1 Damn the mumps 1 ”

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Premier Wade and his Treasurer have been
pointing to the state of the N.S.W. finances as proof of
the high quality of “Liberal” administration. With just
as much justice the Labor people might point to the
state of the S. Australian finances as proof of the high
quality of Labor administration. The position compares
this way :
Revenue for First Quarter.
1906. 1910. Increase.
N.S.W. .. £2,861,738 £3,215,945 121 p.c.
S. Aus. ... 611,193 879,526 435.,,
If the prosperity which has produced an increase in the
revenue of 12$ per cent, in four years is due to the
“Liberals” in N. S. Wales, then the increase of 43$ per
cent, is due to the Labor Premiers Price and Verran in
S. Aus.; and Price and Verran’s figures being far better
than Wade and Waddell’s, it is a fair argument that the
Labor administration produces greater prosperity than
the other brand.

Up to now Westralia can’t complain, of its
railways. The accountant’s certificate, just issued,
shows that, from the start; the earnings have been
£21,100,212, which has paid all working exes, and in-
terest, and left £1,017,863 to the good. This surplus
ought to have been employed in repaying loans, especially
as some of the lines serve decaying goldfields ; instead,
it has been emptied into the general cash-box and used
in relief of taxes. The total outlay has been as follows: —
Loans .. .. .. .. £10,785.382
Revenue advances .. .. 767,503
Loan charges, etc 393,418
Total debt .. .. £11,946,303
The Department publishes very good annual accounts—
just about the best in Australia, while those of N. S.
Wales a.re the wogst. Among other things they show
that the Department has a reserve covering thedepre-
ciati'm of locomotive stock. This fund now amounts to
£232,969. The one fault in it is that the balance to its
credit is apparently not kept in cash or liquid invest-
ments—the one form in which there can be no doubt at
all.aboutthe real existence of a reserve. In any other
form it is liable to be merely a book-keeping entry.
There is the same reason for keeping a plant-renewal fund
in cash, or represented by some definite and preferably
liquid investment, as there is for keeping a fire insurance
reserve that way. The latter fund is a renewal reserve ;
and there is no essential difference between the two. Yet
the Department sees the need of making the insurance
fund a trust account. It used to pay £7OO a year to have
its insurance done for it. Then the rates were put up,
and the Department decided to do its own insuring ; and
promptly it hid a fire which cost £35,437 net. The fund
has, consequently, a whole mob of dead horses to remove
from its premises. The Department proposes to get
rid of the old loss by two annual appropriations, and, at
the same time, charge revenue at the rate of $ per cent.
( = £4OOO a year), until a respectable fund has ’ been
created.

1909. 1910.

Revenue from sale of current.. 7,247 8,416
Revenue from advertising, etc. 156 334

Total revenue ..£136,831 £139,977
Dess working exes 91,853 92,011
Profit as above .. .. .. £44,978 £47,966
A word of explanation is, however,' necessary concerning
the working expenses for the past year, as set out above.
In the revenue account included in the very admirable
statements issued by the Wellington corporation, the
exes, are said to have been £92,947. The difference of
£936 is accounted for by the fact that, of the £1271
charged to revenue account as accident premiums, only
£335 has been paid out; wherefo're the balance .is still in
the hands of the corporation, to the credit of the acci-
dent fund. With some doubts as to whether it is the
right thing or not to do, this amount has been included
among the reserves in the first table. 1 It is a reserve, but
not of the best sort. The profit was cut up as follows :
Interest, £21,134; sinking fund, £5571; written off,
£15,633 ; accident fund, £1936 ; general reserves, £3692.
Strictly there are no reserves at all, though, because
there are still considerable amounts.of capital repre-
sented only by paper assets, including preliminary exes,
and patent rights. These, which still amount to £27,374,
are being written off very slowly, Of the £15,633 written
off altogether last year, only £1431 was applied to. the
reduction of this large, fictitious asset.
The total capital expenditure as at. March 31
this year was £595,782, of which £505,423 has been bor-
rowed, the balance being provided by profits laid, by.
The whole of the depreciation and renewal fund, now
amounting to £57,698, has been thus invested in the
business. The sinking fund (£23,267) is invested in M.L.
municipal securities and mortgages. It is the usual
thing to treat these t'VQ accounts in this dif-
ferent way, though why a fund for the purchase
of new equipment should never or hardly ever be
held in liquid assets isn’t too clear. The accident re-
serve is uninvested for the’ present; but it has a bank
account of its own. The sinking-fund appropriation is
at the rate of 1 per cent, on the -outstanding loans. A
1 per cent, sinking fund, carrying interest at 4 per cent.,
will wipe out the original debt in 41 years, and as this
fund is earning on the average more than 4 per cent., the
time isn’t so very far ahead when Wellington will really
own its tramways. When that happens, there will, of
Course, be no further need for either sink-
ing fund or interest payments; and between them
these two items now amount to over £26,500 a year,
or just about one-fifth of the total revenue. This means
that, once the corporation becomes really the owner of
the concern, it will be able to either reduce the fares on
the average one-fifth, pr hand over £26,500 a year for the
improvement,of the city. If, however, a private co.
owned the lines, the interest charge would be perpetual.
Assuming that such a co. required only 10 per cent.,
then, on the preseriFcapital, there would be a perpetual
charge of £50,500, or £24,000 more than the present com-
bined bill for interest and sinking fund. In ot her words,
public ownership In this case means a present saving of
£24,000 a year, assuming that a private co. would Want a
10 per cent, dividend, and a future saving of £50,500 a
vear. It may certainly be a fact that a private co. would
work the concern more economically ; it is a point upon
which no comparisons of any real value are possible.
But, in any ease, “ economy ” in a case of this sort is just
as likely to be a scandal as a virtue.

Compared with the profits made a few years ago, there
is a material shrinkage here. But the fact that £26,250
of tiie capital, was returned to shareholders in 1908
has to be taken into account. That money was in-
vested in public securities, and the interest, of course,
swelled the profits to the extent of over £lOOO a year.
The actual gross revenue from the business, apart from
sinking fund investments, is shown in this table:—

1910 .. 19,247 8956 10,291
That shows that there is also a steady shrinkage in
revenue from the power-supply business ; and electric
competition, no doubt, accounts for it. The co. probably
hasn’t suffered quite as much in that respect as its brother
in Sydney ; on the other hand, the Melbourne co. is
worse off, inasmuch as its life is limited —hence the
sinking fund previously referred to, and the return of
capital. That fund (included with the reserves) now
amounts to ti 1,660. As this fund is built up, the plan
is now adopted of writing down assets. Therefore,
the sinking fund does not appear in the accounts as
a reserve; and, strictly, that is correct, because
the assets are wasting by reason of the co. having
only a limited life. If the total of the sinking
fund is deducted from the reserves shown in the table,
all that remains is £2558, and it might be more correct to
represent that as the true reserves. One point of import-
ance is the amount necessary to be put aside to accumu-
late a sum equal to the capital during the co.’s life. The
amount necessary to he written off was fixed in 19f'8 at
£3020 a year ; so the surplus profit last year was £693 in
excess of that amount. The 8 per cent. div. is, there-
fore, fairly safe, more especially as it is now payable on
only three-fourths of the old capital; and with the
accumulation of profits it will become still safer—always
provided, of course, that the electrical competition
doesn’t overhaul the co. much faster than it has done
hitherto.

A little over 12 months ago a new rule was passed pro-
viding for a penalty of £1 on the shareholder who failed
to co-operate to the extent of £l2per annum in purchases.
The first effect was an increase in the trade ; the second
is now showing up in the directors’ recommendation to
use the accrued penalties, estimated at £4600, in writing
down capital on the one side and assets on the other.
This provision for depreciation comes in very handy,
because otherwise nothing has been written off against
wear and tear arid depreciation for 2£ years. With the
£356 of present alleged reserves, this will make £4956
available; and as what is judged to be a fair writing-off
will amount to £5548, there will be still a debit balance
or deficit of £592. This does not provide for
any writing down of premises; the directors are,
however, advised that this asset is now worth
considerably more than its cost price. If so, and assum-
ing that the stock has been correctly taken, the present
proposals should amount to a pretty thorough cleaning-up.
It is regrettable, of course, that it has to be done mainly
by forfeiting capital; but some drastic measure was
forced on the management, by the failure of so
many of the co-operators to co-operate—a failure
which, allied to other things, at one time brought
the whole concern to the very brink of smash. What
the ■ other things were it isn’t much use discussing
now. The inexperienced people at the head of
the show tried to run Marathon races before they could
do much more than crawl across the nursery; and,
naturally, they made a mess of things. But, so far as it
has been possible to do it, the mistakes have been wiped
out; Thus the branches which the youngster launched,
even as far off as the West Coast of Tasmania, have been
sold or shut up. The heavy burden of debt isn’t so
easily got rid of; apart from debts to sundry creditors,
the co. still owes over £36,000, nearly all on account of
premises. It is a big handicap ; the one cheerful
feature about it is that the outlay is probably sufficient
to accommodate double the turnover. The bakery
branch, into which the co. put over £22,000, is still a
drag ; but an improvement is shown. Even so there
was a loss of £BB7 for the half-year, apart from whatever
the fair charge was for wear and tear.

Seven years ago the half-year’s turnover was £11,107 ; it
was £17,997 for the past term, and an increase of 60 per
cent, in seven years shows that things are moving the
right way, especially as the profits have moved with the
sales. Still the figures ought to be a lot larger than they
are, and they would be if Brisbane lived even half-way up
to its political professions. The co., which has a very
modest capital of £5627, manages to pull through, never-
theless, without any debt to speak of. In fact, interest
received was more than interest paid last half-year.

This is one of the concerns which persist in the dangerous
practice of allowing capital to be withdrawn on demand
or thereabouts. It was a quaint old idea of the early
co-operators, and apparently had no better reason
than that the capitalist adopted the opposite method.
Ttiis society has had to pay for the notion. Its trouble
has been that it couldn’t get its own people to take much
interest in the proceedings. It didn’t personally concern
them much whether the thing failed or not. If it threat-
ened to fail they could drop in and draw their little bit
of money. If that little bit of money had been at stake
definitely they would have seen that the society didn’t
fail. No doubt, other things helped to fnake it the very in-
different success it has been. For one thing, it attempted
too much too soon, and had to get into debt to do it;
and debt on the one side and indifference on the other
very nearly produced disaster. Things have, however,
been put on a better basis now ; and if the profits that
are made are put by, and used to extinguish the still
considerable debt—over £4ooo—the society may yet be
something for the members to be proud of.

The amounts shown above as written off are fairly large,
considering the size of the concern ; but the position in
that respect is not quite as good as it looks, because a
whole lot of things are thro>vn into the one heap before
being shovelled out. Thus the £904 for the past year
covers depreciation of buildings and plant, and bad and
doubtful debts. So far as the property and plant items
are concerned, the amounts written off have apparently
been as follows :
1904 £1153 1908 £254
1905 1612 1909 305
1906 789 1910 564
1907 434
And £1557 isn’t much to' write off for four years’ depre-
ciation of property, plant, etc., valued at something over
£25,000. Recently the co. has been adding something to
its refrigerating and bottling plant and premises ; and to
do this it has gone a little further into debt. This shows
the movement in that respect:—
1904. 1909. 1910.
Liabilities £5733 £14,037 £14,105
Liquid assets (book debts,
cash, etc.) 7135 9,937 8,544
Surplus £1402
Deficit .. .. .. £4,100 £5,561
In 1904 the paid capital was £29,558 ; 1909, £37,217 ; 1910,
£39,072. So a surplus of £1402 of more or less liquid
assets has been changed into a deficit of £5561,'
although £9514 more cash has' been got in from
shareholders. That extra capital ought, to be
earning £7OO or £BOO a 'year; but the accounts
don’t show the increased profit.' In fact, it
looks as though the new capital has been eating money
instead of making any. Thus in 1904 the “ profits on
ale, grains, etc.,” were'alleged to be £5184, whereas in
the past 12 months they were said to be only £704. It
may be that a good deal of what was formerly thought to
be profit wasn’t anything of the kind, and that this
mythical profit has since had to be written off out of real
profit; but there is no evidence to that effect. On the
face of things it simply looks as though the do. has been
obliged - by competition to keep bigger stocks, and then
hasn’t been able to sell them at any profit to speak of.

This belated post-mortem gives the usual results. There
is no record in this office of any dividend ever paid by the
co., and apparently the co. never intends to pay one if it
can help it. “It is to be regretted,” the directors say,
“that one of the directors has commenced an Equity suit
against the co., and his co-directors individually, to com-
pel them to alter the practice of the co. as hereto carried
on.” This particular director, though a big shareholder
(by inheritance), doesn’t happen to have more than a pet
lamb or so, and that is where the no-dividend shoe
pinches him. The shareholders who are owners of stock
get their dividends in another way. The co.’s object ih
life is to keep the Sydney live-stock market firm. It is
always at the selling yards, where it bids the uttermost
price, and anybody else who buys has to bid higher. Ob-
viously the higher it bids the less profit it can show ; but it
doesn’t want to show a profit—it only wants to make the
public bid higher. The situation is complicated by the
fact that the co. doesn’t always have to pay what it bids ;
most of the big owners allow it a rebate of |d. per lb., so
the public really has to outbid a fictitious bid. It is
good business for the stock-owners, but it is obviously
poor business for the shareholder who isn’t a stock-
owner. But whether he has a case in Equity this
paper doesn’t know, and couldn’t now say if it did
know. Latterly, owing to large numbers of stock
coming forward, the co. has had to take a big quan-
tity.in order to keep up prices; the total paid for live
and slaughtered ment during the past 12 months was
£604,105. The capital actually put up is only £20,315 :
the balance of the £BO,OOO or £90,000 usually required
has been supplied from time to time, during the past 39
years, by the business.

The published accounts put it differently. They say that
the net profit for the year, “after providing for work-
ing expenses, repairs, renewals, depreciation, etc.,”
was £l4l. The other £7OO has been added to
the Depreciation Reserve. This was the only
visible provision for depreciation that was made;
and' if that is so, what are described above as
“apparent profits" were a good deal in excess of the
true profits, for there must have been considerable wear
and tear and con-equent loss of value during the year.
The steamer property stands in* the books at the same
£l7 097 that it did 12 months and two years previously,
and'that is pretty good proof that nothing has been writ-
ten off—in other words, that nothing has been put
bv towards purchasing new boats, apart from the pre-
viously mentioned £7OO. In that respect this co.
is very different from its big, fat brother, the Sydney
Ferries. A new steamer is being built for the co.,
but the purchase means more debt. At June 30, with
onlv £1022 paid on account of the new vessel, the co.
already had a small overdraft (£220), besides £6OOO owing
on debentures. Altogether, the Watson s Bay Co. has poor
luck and even its present dividend appears to be earned
with much difficulty, if it is really earned at all.

There seems to be a bad slump here ; but things are not
alwavs what they seem in a balance-sheet. Thus in the
second half of the previous year the profit amounted to
only £963, the fall from the first half being due,
it was explained, to the commissions having been
reduced by about 25 per cent. In a co-operative
concern of this kind there are really only two things that
the shareholder and supplier need worry much about:
(1) Are.the expens.es kept moderate r (2) Is the m;«nage»
ment getting the best market price for the manufac-
tured goods? The profit shown is a matter of compara-
tively small moment; if a big amount is exhibited, it
means, in most cases, that the suppliers haven t got as
much for their raw materials as the circumstances
warranted, either through an excessive commission
bein"- deducted from the gross value or otherwise. Thus
the best-managed co-operative concern might, easily
show no profit at all' in consequence of the
suppliers getting the uttermost value immediately upon
the delivery of their raw material. This co. began in a
verv small way, and even now has a paid capital of only
£989. Fortunately, it has put aside a fair amount of
profit now and then, and, as shown, it has reserves of
£11,660, which makes its position apparently sound. For
thdugh it has £10,477 on its books—which is practical y
the full extent of its risks—payments are in nearly
all cases made fortnightly at the outside, and
bad debts are, . therefore, as a rule very small-
less than £lOO a half-year as an averqgij. Its
total liabilities, nearly all for the previous fort-
night’s supplies, were £14,682 at the date of the balance ;
as against that there was £9894 in cash, besides stock
(£3824), the book debts previously mentioned, and other
assets. Wherefore presumably nobody is worrying
about the Berrima Oo.’s credit..

It is remarkable the turnover these little local cos. have.
This midget, for instance, handles £40,000 or more a
year. It exports some, and for a co. in that risky busi-
ness hasn’t the reserves it should have. At the,close of
the half-year, however, it estimated that £452 should be
coming to it on account of surpluses—excess of market
realisations over drawings. That and a good deal more
ought to be put by in order to protect the capital; other-
wise, some day a bad slump at an awkward time will
land the co. in trouble. •

The comparatively large amount written off is due to an
adverse report on the old factory by Government in-
spectors. A new factory was then decided on, and has
been built, and the whole has been revalued and written
down to the estimate. Owing to the plant additions the
co. is now in debt. It owed £3658 on June 30, and on the
other side bad stock and.book debts totalling £1573. The
balance of its belongings is fixed. To make its positiop
safe, it will have to go slow for a while in the matter of
dividends and bonuses.
The Melbourne Mercantile Bank Assets Co.
was recently absorbed by the Melbourne Trust,, Ltd. ;
and the transaction begins to smell not quite ’as sweet as
it might. The unpleasant odor arises partly from the
fact that, while the Trust’s offer was under consideration
in .London, what some people claim to have been a better
cash offer was made by a Melbourne syndicate. Somehow
or other this offer was turned down. At the start the
people in London appear to have hkd doubts as to what
the offer meant, and they say they didn’t accept it
partly on the ground of its vagueness and uncertainty ;
it never seems to have occurred to them to spend a
sovereign on a cable of inquiry. That the offer was bona-
fide was sufficiently guaranteed by a reference to the
National Bank. However, the Trust’s offer was accepted,
and now people have been looking up the share-register,
and finding out that some of the people who con trolled the
Mercantile Bank Assets 00.- are also interested in the
Trust Go.; and that has caused a deal of unpleasantness.
The lawyers say that the transaction cannot be dis-
turbed ; but it might be as well, when more “ amalgam-
ations ” of asset cos. are proposed, if those interested
stirred themselves, and dived into the share-registers for
a start.

The market got a hint last week that the Zinc
Convention cat had jumped the right way. It was
known that this combine, designed to give stiffness to the
backbone of the market, was about to expire by effluxion
of time ; and if the thing should not be renewed, and a
fight should start among producers, the spelter market
might go anywhere for a while —it has been as low as
£l6 within the past 10 years, as against the present
£23 10s. or thereabouts. Nothing definite has yet been
announced regarding a renewal of the convention ;
but a hint came from the Baillieus, who had
an option over another 80,000 Amalgamated (De
Bavay) shares at 20s. ; and they called for the little
lot last week. It isn’t a sure sign, qf course; for
Amalgamateds stand at about 325. ; so that the shares
could slump badly and still leave the Baillieus something
to the good. But the exercise of this option at the
present time probably means that the firm has
something. Even without the convention it would be

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair than
Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is of the
well-known Blake type, but has some additional improve-
ments which have justified in practice all the claims
advanced by the patentee. The work of crushing is done
on the down-stroke of the pitman instead of the up-
stroke ; there is no strain on the pitman cap ; two large
side rods resist the thrust of the toggles, and enable the
jaws to be regulated within a large range ; the back
toggle is so made as to resist all legitimate strains of
crushing, but will shear under exceptional conditions
and save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearing-s
are self-lubricating ; the jaws are convex and concave,
and with the cheek plates are made of steel and are
Reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering Company, of
South Melbourne, have installed a great number of these
machines, and hold the sole manufacturing rights for the
Commonwealth.* [3

Lightning Ridge (N.S.W.) is the only Austra-
lian field where black opal occurs. It is situated about 30
miles from the Queensland border, near Angledool, and
consists of a series of low gravel and sandstone ridges. From
one of these latter it derives its name, owing to lightning
having'made grilled mutton of a mob of sheep camped
there some years ago. The presence of surface potch and
“color” was known many years before the field got a
start as an opal producer ; but it was not till Charles
Nettleton, from White Cliffs (N.S.W.), happened along
somewhere about 1902, and discovered saleable stuff, that
much notice was taken of it. Nettleton still works on the
field, and although to date a big value has been won, he
has not yet handled any Government grant for the dis-
covery of a new field, probably because it has not quite ful-
filled* the condition as to the number of men profitably
employed during any given period. Yet the Ridge’s
black gems have been a big advt. for Australia and
N. S. Wales oversea.
Opal as a rule occurs at the Ridge in nodular
shape, generally resting on opal-dirt, and very seldom
occurring in the pure state as at White Cliffs, where one
gets deposits of pure seam opal. As a rule, these nodules
(or “ nobbies,” as they are called locally) are pieces of
various-colored potch, having the opal on or through
them in bars. If the potch is black or dark-colored,
and the bar of opal is free from dirt when polished,
one may have a gem running to many pounds
in weight. All depends then on the brilliancy
and pattern of the color. In the early days of the field
the “ nobbies” were sold in the rough state by weight,
and needless to say at low figures; but that system has
long since been jettisoned. Now all the stuff is treated
on the field by emery wheel and dental lathe, and sold at
per stone or parcel of stones. It is very seldom that a
true black stone is found— i.e., where the color is mixed
up with the black semi-transparent silica. When such
a one is found, and the colors are brilliant, it fetches
fancy prices, no matter how thin the bar of color, so
long as it is bright and level, with a dark b ickground of
potch. One such occurring in a piece of black potch was
sold for half a crown. When faced it turned out a beauti-
ful “painting,” resembling a large pansy, and was
sold for £2O. Another one, of 3dwt., showed a pattern
resembling beautiful colored fish-scales, and realised
£6O. Another man found a lump of poor blue-looking
stuff that he sold to a speculator for a pendant for 7s. 6d.
The purchaser, while grinding it down on a stone, struck
a good colored bar and had it faced. Result, a gem that
realised £45.
But there are flies in the opal-gouger’s oint-
ment, for many apparently safe stones turn out valueless
on the wheel, owing to joints and potch and rubbish
spoiling the bars of color. Owing to the lower grades
being, as a rule, only splashes of color, it is often
practically impossible to realise on them; and so men
keep going in search of the high-grade stuff, which only
occurs in small isolated pockets, often under many feet
of cement and sandstone. And being coated with the
opal-dirt, one can easily throw stones over the dumps.
•Such are often found by the “ noodlers,” who live by
carefully overhauling the refuse.

There isn’t going to Vie the anticipated fight at
the next meeting of the East Greta Coal Co. (N.S. W.).
Two of the directors and a leading official have resigned ;
and that will just about end the trouble. It was all over
a block of coal land next door to the co.’s mine. Years
ago the co. had a lease of it, but threw it up on the
ground that the conditions were too onerous, that it
wouldn’t be w'anted for years, and that, as it wasn’t
much use to anybody else, the co. could get it on
pretty well its own terms whenever it liked. Within
eight or nine years the co. was advised to secure this
same land—in fact, it was told that it would be a most
excellent thing to acquire. So the co. asked the syndi-
cate, which had meantime secured the land for £3454, to
name a price. The original le ise provided for a dead rent
of £3O a year and a royalty of sixpence and threepence
for large and small coal respectively. The syndicate de-
manded for the same lease a dead rent rising from
£lOO to £6OO a year, and a minimum royalty of
6d. and 3d., rising Id. for every rise of Is.
in the selling price of coal beyond 10s. That was too
much to swallow. But the syndicate was told that “ a
more favorable offer will receive cafeful consideration ” ■
so the syndicate reduced its dead rent a trifle, and ap-
parently all was satisfactory. Then, unfortunately, one
of the directors began to make trouble. It was figured
out that “the syndicate's offer meant the payment to
the syndicate of over £200,000 during the currency of
the lease also the composition of the syndicate was in-
quired into. It was at the last-mentioned point that the
really vigorous row started, the end of which was men-
tioned for the sake of convenience at the beginning of
these few sad remarks.

Experimental work is being done with
eucalyptus oil as applied to the flotation process, and
more particularly to the concentration of low-grade
silieious copper ore. Lavers, of the Minerals Separation
Co., Broken Hill, has demonstrated that crude eucalyptus
oil can be used in the process ; and now it is a question
of costs.

Baker’s Creek, Hillgrove (N.S.W.), comes along
with 7210 z. 4dwt. from 159 tons. Of this lot 41 tons came
from the dump, and gave 740 z. But probably not less
than 30 or 40 men were picking and sorting, so that no-
body got rich out of the dump. From the mine 118 tons
gave 6200 z., hence the average must have been something
like £2O per ton. A mine that will give £2O a ton and a
total of 12850 z. of gold since the tributors took a hand a
few weeks since is certainly worth sticking to.
Southern Cross (W.A.) is providing a sensation
in the tales concerning the wonders of a show styled the
Bullfinch, of 150 acres. The lode channel is said to be
1000 ft. wide; no less. In No. 1 shaft a crosscut shows
the reef 25ft. wide, 16ft. of it going 6oz. per ton. Then
40ft. away another shaft shows the lode across the whole
width at 50ft., and values are 15oz. to the ton. The gold
is so finely distributed that roasting is deemed the most
economical means of treatment. So far 63 tons have
returned £l3OO, and the carting of 2000 tons of ore has
only been delayed owing to the state of the roads.
Doolette, lately manager of the Boulder No. 1, is the
owner of the marvel. True, a mining man who is
supposed to know a bit sold 7-16ths of the show
for a miserable £lOOO before it was opened on,
but last week he paid £lOOO for l-16t,h, though, if the
yarns printed about the mine are half true, he ought to
have paid £lOO,OOO. Southern Cross, on the strength of
this and one or two other finds, is bubbling with excite-
ment, and has never had such a headache since it was
the busy top of the line to the fields.

There is still a chance apparently for the Great
Fingall (W.A.). Latest developments at the No. 17 level
show ore wo-th 375. 9d. oyer 137 in. ; 73in. of the lode is
worth 535. This is at the point where work has been
going on for some time to see whether the lode lived
again. Odds are now slightly favoring the geologist’s
opinion that if certain lines be followed there is every
chance of the reef being picked up.

Victorian-managed mines get down to very low
costs sometimes; but the mines have to be at home.
And Hans Irvine’s Black Range isn’t at home. Roughly-
speaking, costs can usually be reckoned at about £1 in
Westralia; but at the Black Range they are nearly
double that —335. a ton. Mining costs 15s. 7d. per ton,
treatment 6s. lid., realisation Is Id., development
7s. 4d., general 2s. Dividends certainly are good ; but
thank the mine for that.
* * * *
Black Range West, which has been after the
underlay of the Black Range reef (W. A.), has got it, though
the co. isn’t yet absolutely certain that there is money
in it. The formation is sft. wide, but thegold is patchy';
in places the values have been as much as 100 s. over a
width of 12in. The prospect is clearly worth persevering
with.

The year’s report of Great Fitzroy (Q.) makes
doleful reading. The working account showed a loss of
£10,861, and on top of that have to be heaped commis-
sions, management exes., etc., so that in the end £19,753
is the total deficit for the 12 months. Even then nothing
is written off to cover depreciation. The accounts are
made up as at June 30, and things have been cleaned up a
little since then ; but at that date there were liabilities
totalling 1:50,742, apart from the advances against
matte shipments. The recent debenture issue, on account
of which £53,500 has been received, has no doubt squared
things up. The directors don’t explain how the disaster
happened. As a matter of fact, almost everything went
a little wrong. Loring put it this way in his report:
“The late superintendent was over-sanguine of his ability
to do more than anyone had ever accomplished before oil
an ore of thischaracter.” So a flotation plant is to goin ;
and thus the future is still a matter only of conjecture—
it means that another experiment is to be tried. Along
with the flotation plant there will have to be a sintering
plant to prepare the stuff for the furnaces. There may
be a profit in the mine ; but at present it seems practi-
cally certain that the capital will have to be cut down.
Fitzroy isn’t a £600,000 proposition on present appear-
ances, especially when there’s a £lOO,OOO debenture issue
to be fed first.
* * * *
The Towers market slumped heavily lately
owing- to the fact that the Blocks machinery is working
at its top and the water is heavy ; so the directors have
decided to crosscut into the footwall. But (and it is an
important but) the Blocks shaft is close to the Brilliant
P.O. lease. Should the crosscut get anything, there will
be a big rise in the P. 0., as there is 3ft. of good stone in
the winze 500 ft. above. The P.C. people are in a happy
position, as the Freehold, Blocks, St. George and the
Mexican are prospecting around them.
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, crushed 190
tons for £BOO. This co. holds a big block of 100 acres on
the Brilliant, but its workings have not got down to
within (roughly) 450 ft. of the depth that is being explored
bv the Brilliant Extended. The opening of No. 20 by the
Extended at a depth of nearly 2900 ft. is an event of con-
sequence to the Deeps, because No. 19 level carries a
strong reef for more than 300 ft. towards the Deeps’
boundary. The reef that produced the last crushing is
showing fairly good stone in the bottom level, so there
are hopes that development work (which means deeper
sinking) on this section of the Brilliant formation will
meet with success. Bonnie Dundee continues to open up
the 609 ft. formation with encouraging results. A winze
has been sunk a few feet, and is showing 6in. of stone in
the hanging wall ; 71 tons crushed for an average of
£5 Us. Bd. per ton. The east level is jn 116 ft., with 6in.
of stone in the end. The formation driven on by the
Brilliant Extended n behalf of the Bonnie has not yet
disclosed any pavable stone.
* * * *
Brilliant-Stockholm, Charters Towers, crushed
1179 tons for £4715. The profit is required by the
Brilliant Co. to repair its shaft on the old Brilliant P.C.
lease and to equip it with a winding plant. Naturally,
the deep levels below the Brilliant formation, from which
the parent mine paid £700,000 in dividends, are of great
interest to Charters Towers, because if, as suspected,
there are payable formations at greater depths, the
northern field will hold its end up for many a long day
to come. So far, the only evidence that there is payable
stone are the improved prospects shown near the bottom
of the winze sunk from the 1513 ft. level in the Brilliant
P.C. lease. Further along the northerly dip of this reef
the Brilliant Block is exploring maiden country, but the
work has been exceptionally slow and difficult because of
the heavy water—and this is keeping the whole field in
suspense.

Cold type can’t express the contemptuous inflec-
tion with which an ordinary Charters Towers man has
mentioned a show as being “ outside.” Anything “ out-
side ” the horseshoe from the Day Dawn has been sniffed
at on sight. However, the crushings taken by Boyce and
co. from the Cumberland are beginning to w’ake some of
them up to the fact that there are possibilities outside
the magic belt. The party is now putting through a
crushing of 1500 tons, which is expected to average £8
per ton ; so far, 470 tons have been put through, from
which (including sand and sludge) £3600 has been real-
ised. The July crushing of 250 tons yielded £2012.
The brokers eye the figures sadly, for there is no scrip to
handle.

“ Platman ” : The ordinary deputation has a
cool cheek ; but one that recently waited on Queensland
Railway Minister Paget, with a request for a railway from
Mount Mollov to Port Douglas, put the thermometer
below zero. It estimated the cost of construction at
£2500 per mile. This almost stupefied Paget, who re-
torted that the Cairns-Mareeba line (45 miles) cost nearly
£1,500,000, and last year paid £1 6s. 9d. per cent, on the
capital. He also mentioned casually that the same range
would have to be got over by the proposed line. Paget
gave little encouragement, but promised a survey when
a surveyor was available. The fact is a big timber con-
cession was granted to the Molloy Co.' without any fuss ;
and apparently the chief, though unavowed, object is to
make the Molloy tramway or railway a connecting link
between two Government, lines, with its probable future
purchase by the usual universal benefactor.

Another rumpus over the Cathcart. Ararat
(Vic.)! Some one bought shares on an oversold market;
so when a find was made further up the lead, values slid
away from the bears as fast as a pair of feet from beneath
a new-chum skater. This started the healthiest growl
heard for months. Boulter had to puff over to Peacock
to ask “ Why?” and “Whaffor?” What Peacock ha-
ha’d to him this deponent knoweth not. But it has been
made abundantly clear by George Bryant, mine-mana-
ger, that he only got good wash on Thursday.
Bryant’s idea is that he is on the higher reaches of the
Ileatherbell run of gold, which was responsible for the
last boom.' If so, the “shorts” may have to walk the
clank. But there is some hope for them in that little
“if,” for the Heatherbell run has been suggested as the
cause of every patch of rich {told met in the lead for the
ast 1000 ft. liven if the present find be the Heatherbell
lead, it is worth noting that nothing- g-ood is turning- up
iurth er dow,n the gutter, so the bears won’t risk much in
waiting' to see if more than a patch has been got. North
Uatheart is supposed to be on the Heatherbell lead, yet

Long Tunnel Extended, Walhalla (Vic.), has
got to bedrock after a quarter of a century of real Fat-

the laps of holders since rich gold was hit in Cohen’s reef
on its making into the claim from the Long Tunnel mine,
bhares have been widely distributed ; 800 people hold the
9000 shares in the co., and among them, unfortunately,
are many who look for big dividends in preference to
safety. To them a 2s. call spells a lot, and they begin
to show restlessness over some of the frills that
were not noticed when cash from the gold sales
could be splashed about. The Extended missed
the. bus. by turning down the scheme for amalga-
mating with the Long Tunnel. Now it has to poke about
in the North Tunnel Consols ground to try for a rise
there. Those who stuck to the mine were fanatic in
their belief that the last would never be seen of the rich
shoot worked down to 2500 ft. If the awakening has
been unexpected to them, it is cruel to recall that it
ought to have been foreseen.

Bendigonians found Melbourne men on the
warpath at the Catherine Reef United meeting. Their
determination to put fresh blood into the directorate was
not softened even by the optimistic report sent out for
the half-year. Cash in hand represented a solid sum,
mine-development work was promising, and expenses
were low. In spite of all that, Melbourne wanted room
on the Board. So “Sandy” Oliver, one of the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchang'efavorites, and Hooper, chairman
of the Marvel Loch, stepped into two places, when one
of the Lansells and one of the Dyasons stepped out.
Bendigo has always looked so well after its own mines that
no one ever counted on outside help being insisted on.
And now that it has been insisted on, Bendigo asks what
good a Stock Exchange “ toff ” and the director of a Wes-
tralian third-rate co. can do! They can’t put more gold
in the stone, and if they cannot heip the management by
giving it a new battery, Bendigo assumes that all they
will do will be to bring out a pretty report in a pretty
cover.
When the question of mining costs comes up,
then the Anchor, of Blue Tier (Tas.), breasts the tape.
It is run by little Lewis, of the soft hat, who filled the
gap when Lindesay Clark went over to the Briseis. In all
103,000 tons of granite were jabbed through the Anchor
mill last year at a cost of 2s. B|d. per ton. Water
power was to hand to help ; still, this is a tip-
top record, though not the best Lewis has put up.
Of course, the w ork is quarrying ; but even so, exes, have
to be watched to get figures down like that. Wear and
tear goes on always, and explosives and supplies have to
be got to the mine, labor has to be paid, and the
weather has to be regarded as a costs factor. The
dirt treated is poor stuff; 103,000 tons only returned
158 tons of black tin, or under 3£lb. per ton.
Then, when Frank Gee Duff slung up the Blue Tier leases
which Slicht turned down for Mount Lyell, Lewis
pounced on three of the best to add to his domain.
Also, he wheedled the Tasmanian Parliament to lend the
Anchor £5OOO to help it over its financial Worries. He
next looped in the Australian tin lease,and put up an aerial
tram from the gully to his battery. So now he is mon-
arch of all the Blue Tier surveys. What he still needs
most is cash and more battery power, so that he may
open up the new'ground and work on three times the
present scale. That done, with a decent water-supply he
may make low'-grade Blue Tier ore pay a div.

Last year’s Tasmanian output of copper was
valued at £608,038, with tin a good second—£4lB,l6s.
Gold figures at £190,201, and nearly half of this came out
of the Tasmania mine. Only £56,237 worth of coal was
produced. Spelter has not yet been produced, but a
good deal of zinc blende has been exported from the
Hercules.
Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) is making improvements to
its water supply. The output of low-grade dirt is being
maintained at 19,000 tons per month, from which the
concentrator extracts 90 tons of black tin. It is ob-
viously very poor dirt. To atone for that, working costs
are kept down to about 4s. 3d. per ton ; once or twice, in
fact, the average has been down to 3s. lOd. But the
Anchor, also in Tasmania, beats even that; it treated
102,283 tons, at an average cost of 2s. B|d. The output
W'as black tin, so the Anchor requires to
handle 641 tons of tin dirt to produce a ton of black tin,
worth about £96 per ton.
* * * *
The old Tasmania gold mine (Tas.) seems likely
to pull off its reconstruction scheme, pay its debts (which
are pressing) and make a fresh start with brighter pro-
spects. Last year the mine produced £92,578 from 56,153
tons of stone, an average of £1 12s. lid. per ton ; and
still the co. was swept on to the rocks. The latest report
states that the deepest shaft is down 1470 ft. The 1370 ft.
level is in a make of ore lift, wide and assaying 9£dwt.
per ton. A winze 93ft. west of the crosscut that runs out
from the shaft is showing good prospects, assay's averag-
ing 36dwt. There is, however, a poor development in's
winze on the eastern side of the crosscut. In view of
the good reports, some local shareholders can’t seethe
force of reconstruction and calls. And they would be
right, too—if rich assays could pay off debt.
* * * *
Chairman .Harvey, .of Wallaroo and Moonta
(S. A.), isn’t optimistic about the copper market, nor
does his co. pretend to be among the cheap producers.
Wallaroo is in the same class as half a dozen big American
mines, that turn out the metal at about £53 per ton.
Next to these are five Yankee mines, which produce at
from £4B upwards; then 16 important concerns, which
can lay down refined copper at £42 11s. 10d.—and that
same isn’t cheerful reading for the producers on the £5O
mark. Among the large American producers, Nevada
Consolidated quotes 6.34 cents or 3T7d. per lb.; and
Utah, 7'53 cents per lb. Calumet and Hecla, with an
output of 35,156 tons a year, is among the 16 cheapest.

Nelson (M.L.) wants to be a Newcastle too;
and a local syndicate threatens to bore for coal handy to
the southern town’s fine new harbor.
* * * *
When the Civil Service Co. of Victoria decided
to go out of the Zeehan (Tas.) business, a local co. was
formed, with the help of the Miners’ Association. The
first-half-year showed a profit of £l7O, of which £lB was
written off ; the past half-year (to July 26) shows £169,
of which £2l is written off. The capital is £2232 ; 5 per
cent, is to be paid on this, and the balance carried for-
ward. The little concern hasn’t as much capital as it
could do with, wherefore it owes £1513 ; but as it seems
to have some genuine co-operators behind it, it will pro-
bably not be harassed for bonuses for a while ; and that
will give it a chance to get square.

Auditor-General Connali, of Queensland, begins
to make nasty remarks about his State’s boom financing.
There is the ease of the Seaforth estate, for instance,
which was repurchased after some vigorous log-rolling.
On this transaction the State is so far many thousands to
the bad; yet the Government goes on crediting itself
with interest on the total cost, and the accumulated
interest is reckoned next year as an asset. Says the
Auditor-General: “It is, I contend, wrong in principle to
credit consolidated revenue with interest on an amount
of purchase money, etc., when it becomes evident that
such purchase money', etc., will never be realised.” It is
something more than wrong in principle. It is dishonest
■ in practice.

A Victorian missionary is responsible for a,very
vague suspicion that Fiji contains an Eldorado. Lately
he told a yarn of some visitors to the islands who picked
up some stone that had been used for a decorative
purpose. Examination showed that the rock - was
spattered with gold, and an assay yielded at the rate 1 of
2oz, to the ton. Thereupon the excited people crowded
back for more stone; but, owing to the indisposition of
the niggers to help them, they were unable to repeat their
previous find. This story was circulated recently at Ben-
digo(Vic.), and impressed some people with money to burn.
Forty-five of them have now advanced £lO each to pay
the expenses of an early inquiry. In a few days an expert
sets out for Fiji to discover if the tale has any visible
means of support.

“ M.C.” ; Years ago, before the export trade in
zinc concentrates was of much account, The Bulletin
advocated liberal assistance to the spelter and galvanis-
ing industries. Nothing was done ; so the foreigner col-
lared the trade and entrenched himself behind a differen-
tial tariff, shipping subsidies and special' freight rates.
Now, at last, Newcastle, through its Chamber of Com-
merce and Smelters’ Union, has woke up and is advocating
an export duty on ore. Whilst Australia sfept, the ex-
port grew to enormous proportions ; last year the out-
put was 373,906 tons, valued at £1,041,280. It is practi-
cally impossible to shift the spelter business out of
Europe by merely putting an export duty on zinc ore.
But Australia can do a great deal by liberally helping the
galvanising trade and incidentally making a local market
for spelter. Galvanising, it should be remembered, is a
permanent business, and would give a great deal of em-
ployment.

and we give up the reins.” It was the cheerfullest bury-
ing Victoria has had for many a year.

“ Bridge-dweller ” sends a vote of thanks :
In haste, I grab my pen to write a few congratulatory
words to Ambrose Dyson for his picture (B. l/9/’XO) of
that great Australian institution, the swagman. At last
IN THE WAKE OF
THE RUBBER BOOM.
LANDLADY : "May I ask, Mr. Slopay, why you
dip your knife in your glass of water before
cutting your meat?”
MR. SLOPAY : “ Oh, merely a little trick, madam,
which I learnt from a friend of mine in a
rubber factory .”
Justice (mind the capital) has been done to this much-
abused subject, and he has been depicted As He Is.
Countless Bulletins have come and gone, and alleged
swagmen have wandered across the pages—an eyesore to
all true sundowners, for the artists, having built
them up complete, even to the bowyangs, broken
bools and whiskers, not even forgetting the look
of “ weird expectancy,” have neglected to provide
the first essential of a successful bagman’s outfit—
viz,, a nose bag. A swagman without a nose bag would
be just about as successful on the track as J. Bull’s
Dredgenought would be in action without a commander
or a rudder ; in fact, the nose bag discharges both these
offices. The fulness thereof decides the direction he will
go and the distance he will travel in a given time. Be-
sides this, it keeps Matilda at a proper elevation for
comfort, hanging well down when afflicted with partial
emptiness, and up as high as possible when full. I say
partial emptiness, because no true Never-Never expert
would allow his bag to become absolutely empty. I feel
strongly on this subject of the nose bag and the proper
accoutring of the swagman, for I have been much afraid
the Australian type might be degenerating towards the
level of his Maoritand nephew (I cannot call him brother)
who has forgotten (if he ever knew) how to roll a swag,
but carries all his belongings in a four-bushel sack.
Dyson’s picture has reassured me, and I go to bed with
an easy mind. But now, when I come to take a last look,
I hope it isn’t merely an extra bit of bagginess of shirt.
If it is—no ;it mustn’t be. Let me believe it is a nose-
bag and be happy.
Your head doesn't appear to
have been injured at all.”
COMPLAINANT (triumphantly): “ No;
but you oughter see the plate!"
DAMAGES.
MAGISTRATR : “ You say your wife struck you on the head with a plate.
“ The Gumsucker ” :
I’m getting weary of the livery bush chaps who gibe at
“Jimmie Pannikin.” I don’t know James from a Collins,
street Esquimau, but he writes true Australian nature-
notes ; and, as a bush-bred and bush-loving pedagogue of
another State, I’m butting in to have a piece of “ Kola,”
who objects to Jimmie’s name. That’s a dashed poor
thing to bump a man for, as “ Kola ” does. He ought to
change his name, as kola is a low, vile nut chewed by
down-grade Tamils in Ceylon. Or perhaps he’s dropped
an“a” outofit, and it should be “ koala,” a squealing
bear. On consideration, I guess he needn’t change his
name—it fits him nicely. But I, without charge or fee
of any kind, suggest to “Kola’s” notice another pen-
name eminently suited to him and his work. It is
“ Mud.” All which is said in defence of “J. Pannikin,”
who, judging by his Bulletin pars, has the big white
strain well developed.

“ The Downy Bird ” : “Pick” (B. 8/9/’10)
flies off his handle in his effort to break the lyre-
bird’s reputation as a star mimic. “Pick’s”
trouble is that he hasn’t observed the lyre-bird at
the right time. In the winter, when the snow is
on the ground, the lyre-bird does not mimic, but
confines himself to the unholy squawks that
“Pick” mentions, and to his full song—which
song, by the way, is our best rebuttal of the over-
seas lie that Australia has no bird melodists. But
in late summer the Bohemian fowl does mimic any-
thing and everything that he has
ever heard or dreamt of. For a
good hour I have lain, regard-
less of the ants, flat on my
wishbone, watching an old,
battered, draggle-tailed lyre-
bird giving the most as-
tonishing ventriloqnial
turn ever heard out of a
music-hall. The notes of
jackass, whip-bird, grey
shrike, thrush, magpie,
jay, domestic fowl, lark
black cockatoo, gang-
gang, red lory and many
others were reproduced with a
bsolute fidelity. The lyre also makes
various weird rows like a rip-saw at work and a
jinker-wheel screeching for grease ; but I won’t
risk prosecution for perjury by swearing that
these noises are intentionally imitative.

“ Werrimee ” : To a quiet man, or one
who is fond of reading, the shearers’ hut is a den
of horror. There are men whose tongues are
never still, and, as might be expected, these are
the ones who seldom say anything worth hearing.
There is the rattling of dice and the shuffling and
chatter.of card-players; the repetition of “fifteen-
two, fifteen-four”; and the euchre-players’ ever-
lasting “Pass!” “I’m away !” “She’s down !”
“Byme ! ” and so forth. The man who bangs hi g
fist on the table with every winning card he plays
is particularly obnoxious. Occasionally he gets
his deserts in the form of a flying boot. There
are draught-players, domino enthusiasts, noughts-
and-crosses cranks and fox-and-goose lunatics ;
there are loud discussions, arguments—mostly
about dogs and horses, yarning, singing ana
whistling, all to the accompaniment of half a dozen
mouth-organs, tin whistles and .Jews’ harps and a
cracked concertina. It’s hard to follow the
adventures of Reginald de Clancy through
the jungles of the Punjaub under such
disturbing conditions; it is harder still to
compose a soulful epistle to your best girl, pining
for her shearer boy down south. When the lights
go out you learn the sleeping characters of your
shed mates. There are several asthmatical nuis-
ances who cough intermittently ; about a dozen go
pig-hunting, and are pursuing thespotted onenearly
all night; others fidget and kick and roll, have
nightmares and other nocturnal visitations, and
yell blue murder in their sleep; a few are troubled
with insomnia, and get up at frequent intervals
to fill and light their pipes. And there are the
town-goers, who come stumbling in about mid-
night, with noise enough to awaken the cemetery.
When that row has subsided, the 30 or 40 dogs
tied up outside begin to corroboree in dismal and
melancholy tones. Somebody yells at them to lie
down, and one or two arise to throw firewood and
jam-tins at them. The nights are pretty near all
alike, so you don’t wonder at the number of tents
and bush gunyahs that are scattered about the
neighborhood.
“E.S.S,” : Curiosity is among the fatal
diseases which afflict the emu. Any tink-
ling or musical sound will attract rather than
disperse it. I was sitting one morning in
front of a splitters’ tent on Myrtle Creek
(N.S.W.) when two emus passed within 100yds.
of the camp. The splitter picked up a stick and
began tapping gently on a square tin bucket.
The birds stopped immediately, with a quick
straightening of the bodies and an air of inquiry
and wonderment that was eloquent. “ Goodness
gracious, Emma, do you hear that?” You could
read the question in Bill’s countenance in the
stretching and quivering of his neck, Emma
side-stepped cauti-
ously, “Let’s run,”
she advised ; “it’s a
myall cam p.”
“ Never seen one
like it before,” said
Bill, too curious to
go away. “ Never
heard a sound like
that before.” Pre-
sently they passed
back within a chain
of us. They returned
still nearer, and, as
the monotonous tap-
tap continued, they
approached the
fourth time to with-
in 15yds. of where
we sat. Here they
stood for about two
minutes, with heads
held high and
slightly moving,
staring at us. “I
do wonder what
■that can be ! ” Bill
seemed to say, as he
stretched his neck
and peered this way
and that. The split-
ter ceased tapping,
and suddenly stood
up. Emma almost
fainted, and Bill
got such a shock
that he jumped a
foot off the ground,
and for a few
seconds couldn’t re-
collect what to do
next. Then, with
a short, vibrating
cry and a ruffling
of feathers, they
turned and ran
swiftly into the
bush. Another day
an old lubra was
sitting on the bank
of a waterhole, fish-
ing. She had been
very quiet for a
long time, patiently
watching the water.
All at once the corner of her eye lit on a black
head and a long neck thrust over her shoulder,
and with a frantic yell she sprang out into the
deep water. She rose to the surface in time to
see a big emu departing in great haste for the
horizon. It took her quite half an hour to state,
in a loud voice, what she thought of the inci-
dent, and to express her opinion of “ that ——
emu ” and all its ancestors.

“ Jimmie Pannikin ”: Following “Kola’s”
advice, I have been “doing something,” viz.,
wallowing in a wonderful wealth of wattle, Back-
o’-Binda, Beyond-Burrowa. Yonder-from-Yass,
and, in my expansion and exaltation of spirit,
saying prayers for all so cruelly afflicted as poor
“ Kola.” In Yass, Gundagai, Burrowa, Murrum.
burrah, etc., Wattle Day was celebrated with
real enthusiasm ; hence there is every hope that
our lovelv indigenous flora will soon get adequate
Australian appreciation. We don’t want foreigners
to shame us by their culture of our native trees,
shrubs and flowers. If the Golden Splendor of
the Bush were an imported tree, hundreds of
alleged Australians would rush to buy it and rave
over its exquisite beauty of color and scent —at
2s. a plant. Some day a brainy bush student will
learn how to extract wattle scent, and he will
earn the gratitude of perfume-lovers and make a
fortune. Next year I intend to gather all my
assailants into a solid phalanx and turn them
loose in parts of this district, where the wattles
grow in thousands, in order that their souls may
get a chance to expand. The wattle teaches
Australians and others how the yellow and the
green should live in perfect harmony. Think of
that!

“Machete”: Papuan officialdom, what-
ever its virtues may be, is sadly lacking in the
matter of gay clothes. But the black or murky
divisions of the service make up in some measure
for their bosses’ backwardness. The A.N.C.
(Armed Native Constabulary) wear dark-blue
serge shirts and sulus, bound with scarlet; and
the old hands also sport dinky little forage
caps with the one-time badge of the corps, a bird
of paradise in a brass circlet. The Village Con-
stables, poor relations of the A.N.C., wear blue
dungaree with a scarlet cummerbund. The Cus-
toms boat-boys and orderlies go gay in blue, with
white band and edgings, like the 17th Lancers or
the Carabineers. The hospital boys wear blue
and yellow, and the warders blue and black. The
tourist, reading these notes, will thus be able to
decide in future, if he is accosted by an unintelli-
gent Papuan official, whether he is (a) being told
to move on ; (b) asked if he has buried his rela-
tions under his house ; (c) requested to pay duty
on the drink he had before coming ashore; (d)
commanded to put out his tongue ; or (e) told to
“ come along wid me.”

“ Jimmie Pannikin ” (at his own risk) :
I protest against “Gil’s” complaint that the bugle-
blasts of tbe Sunset-land coach-drivers should be
abolished. All loyal lovers of the Cinderella country
hope that the old habits will not all be allowed to die out.
Many of the Coolibah Charlie stamp of coachdriver owe
their magnificently-developed chests to regular practice
on their bugles in the exhilarating air of Outback.
Apart from that, many a weary hour is solaced
by bugle-blowing; even passengers find benefit in
practising the deep breathing necessary to make
even fairly successful buglers. The depressing mon-
otony of the night drives on the lonely tracks
is so awful that drivers would often go “dotty”
but for the instrument habit, not only when enter-
ing the sleepy, sandy western towns, but out in the
open spaces. Sometimes the silence becomes so oppres-
sive that Coolibah Charlie and Co. talk aloud to them-
selves or discuss politics with the horses. By all means
let the Sunset coach-drivers blow their bugles to the last,
for they need all the variation and excitement and
amusement they can sandwich into the dull, dead level
of their daily and nightly lives. Please tie up “Kola,”
“ Claypan,” “ A. William-Cann ” and the other suburban
bushmen, and let this matter, if it is to be debated, be
discussed by real sand and saltbush sages like “ Gil,” E.
S. Sorenson and Myself.

“M. Magee, jun.” : Americanisms are
gradually poking their nose into the Australian
slanguage. Was travelling on the Darling Downs
(Q.) recently, accompanied by Matilda, when I
turned into a cooky’s selection. In answer to my
knook the missus came to the door, with a crying
child hanging to her skirts. My “Good-day”
was inaudible above the lamentations, and the
mother turned on the infant. “Shut up,” she
snapped, “or I’ll give you to the bummer, and he’ll
eat you.” I could have given her a bit of tinned
tongue myself, but I didn’t—l just shook Matilda
up, and got.
ANXIOUS TO BE DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When you’re weary, worn and tired and you haven’t got
a bob ;
When you’ve worn your boots out tramping round the
city for a job ;
When you feel your stomach sticking like a plaster to
your spine,
And unconsciously you linger near where once you used
to dine;
When you’ve measured all the pavements and you’ve
counted all the shops,
When you’re known to every urchin, and you’re watched
bj' all the “ cops,”
When you’re greeted as a comrade by the deadbeats
whom you meet,
And your friends are always busy when they see you in
the street;
When you slyly take a side-glance in the windows, just
to see
If the bottoms of your trousers are the shape they ought
to be ;
When you feel that all the people that you meet with
seem to stare
At the portion of your garment that gets rubbed upon
the chair—
Then you ought to go and listen at the corner of the
street,
Where the meek and lowly Christians slang each other
when they meet.
It will do you good to hear them tell how “ blessed are
the poor ”
And especially the dead ones— they’re at rest for
evermore !
They will teach you to appreciate the goodness of the
Lord ;
And turn for consolation to a study of His Word.
And if your coat and pants and boots are letting in the
rain,
You’ll know that, though on earth below you suffer
grief and pain,
A little later, up in Heaven, you’ll keep your clothing
dry,
And you’ll get a solid breakfast in the happy by-and-
bye.
You’ll get a change of raiment, and you’ll also get a
shave,
And your corns will cease to trouble when you pass
beyond the grave.
What a splendid time you’re having! If you only
understood
That this temporary trouble is intended for your good !
Could you only get that notion firmly planted in your
head,
Like the early Christian Martyrs, you’d be anxious to
BE DEAD.

“ Larrakeyah ” on [a Northern Territory
sore:—
“ Vigilans,” who writes on the sale of aboriginal
children to Chows (B. 21/7/10), tells only half the tale.
Young- lubras are sold, not only to Chows, but to bad
whites. One child, nine years old, was bought by a white
for about 2s. The Chow not only buys black children,
but purchases half-caste girls as well. A girl of 15 was
purchased in Darwin lately, with the consent of her
mother (a white woman, Heaven help her !), and the Chow
who made the deal had two other “ wives.” The price
Was £4O. Of course, there are laws against it; for one
thing, the age of consent in the Territory is 17 years.
But where are the proofs of sale? The buyer denies all
knowledge of the transaction ; the seller, a black, has no
Standing in a court of law—certainly no standing where
so many of the police and jurymen have themselves been
at the game. One former Government Resident left
several half-caste youngsters behind him, children now
in the blacks’camps, “married” to blacks, and sold on
occasion to any old Combo who has a nip of gin in his
pocket. There can be no redress until the Government
forms concentration camps, and punishes with severity
every unauthorised white caught in the camp.
SURE OF A WELCOME.
LADY AVIATOR: “ How fortunate! We're right
above Mrs. Johnson's, and, she’s so often
asked us to drop in.”
“ Vigilans ” : A correspondent (B. 8/9/’10)
writes that someone has been hauling my limb re
big buffalo bags. Well, I know something of the
country. I have lived there amongst buffalo-
shooters, drovers, cattle-duffers, tin-scratchers,
copper-gougers, Chows and niggers ; and I have
ridden right through from Pine Creek to Sydney.
Although the buffalo has been thinned out,
Laurie exports 2000 or 3000 hides yearly ; and he
is only one in the business. Men familiar with
the coastal country are of my opinion that
buffalo-raising would be a lucrative industry,
and there is a good market in the East
(or North, to be accurate). As a matter
of fact, the Territory is shamefully neglected
as far as industry is concerned. The outlook for
the supply of cotton on the world’s market is any-
thing but reassuring ; yet cotton is growing wild
on the shores of Port Darwin and along the
rivers, and there is no doubt it could be grown
easily and extensively in the Territory. Other
industries awaiting development are sisal hemp-
growing, rubber-growing, rice cultivation, raising
Angora goats, pigs, Zebu and buffalo, turtle-
canning, and many others. Incidentally, keeping
an eye on the discolored tribes of Asia would be
a payable Australian industry.
THE UNPARDONABLE OFFENCE.
COW SLAVE (who wants a “rise”): “But you promised to raise me wages if I pleased yer !”
COW OWNER: “ Well, dammit, man, d’ye think you are pleasin’ me now?”
“ Narrew “ Dandalup ” has kindly sup-
plied (B. 15/9/TO) some more information about
the sheoaks near N. Narrewarren (Vic.), and to
bolster up his yarn he says “Narrewarren”
means “ the sheoaks by the sea.” What sea—
Gulf of Carpentaria or King George’s Sound ?
As a matter of fact, Narrewarren does not mean
“ the sheoaks by the sea ” any more than it means
“the pancake on the tomb.” It merely means
“no good.” I don’t know how it got the name,
unless the ancient King Billy named it after a
relative who gave him information similar to that
given by “Dandalup.”
“ Silas Snell” : Dave lives next door. He
had had a serious row with Polly in the morning.
and he came home drunk in the evening.
Dave had only one complaint against
Polly. She persisted in the idea that
he should work and support the family.
Dave came up the back yard weeping
desolately. He leaned against the
woodshed and sobbed for five minutes.
Later, I heard him in the bathroom.
“ Polly,” he called, “ come ’n’ see.
Thish ish the end. Come ’n’ see
the last of yer brokenartedusban’ !
Dave’s goin’t’ drownd hisself. Pore
ole Dave!” The unhappy man
sobbed for a time, moaning at inter-
vals : “ Poor old Dave !’’ Then
Polly’s soprano squealed from the
kitchen: “Oh, shut up, will yer,
and get on with yer drowndin’! ”
Dave then locked the bathroom door
determinedly. He sat for perhaps 15
minutes, crying. Then he called
through the keyhole: “ Goo’-bye,
Polly ! I forgive yeh everythin’.” He
made a good deal of noise getting into
the bath. Then silence followed. After
that, gurgles. When silence set in again
Polly ran into the street, screaming at the
top of her voice. A crowd assembled,
and Polly indulged in hysterical assort-
ments on the roadside. Sympathetic souls
carried her indoors, and presently she was
in a position to explain that Dave was
committing suicide. A neighbor darted
out for the police. When the force arrived
Polly was again inarticulate, so the Law
broke open the bed room door in quest of the
corpse. Later in the chase, it arrived at the
bathroom, with 15 agitated females at its
heels. It broke down the bathroom door.
Dave was at the bottom of the bath, still
and cold. He had been there quite 20
minutes, and life would have been extinct but
for one thing—he had forgotten to turn on the tap.

“W.C.M.”: I met the first cousin to
“Maitai’s” Austrian “wine” (B. 4/8/’10) at Lake
Darlot (W.A.), way back in the ’9o’s. The
usual gold-rush crowd had arrived there from
Kalgoorlie, leaving the necessaries of life and
other drinks 300 miles behind them. Only one
man had the forethought to bring a 100-gallon
cask of rum, which he retailed at a “bob” a
nobbier. When that ran out, he made his own
grog. We sampled it, of course, and, finding it
good, went at it till it got us down and wouldn’t
let us up in the natural way human beings have
of standing. While the effect lasted we went
about much in the fashion of Higginson in the
silly Cavalier song in “The Merry Widow”—
looking for all the world like a crowd of kangaroos
gone in the knees. I wanted the recipe; I could
have made a fortune out of it by filling myself up
and starring as the only human kangaroo in exist-
ence. The inventor wouldn’t part, however, so
I’m still battling for a crust.
“ M. Magee, jun.” : I hasten to express
belief in “J. Pannikin’s ” yarn of the sheep-dog
suckling two lambs, in view of a somewhat similar
case that came under my notice. This was at
Carter’s station, Flinders River (Queensland),
where a lady-sheep suckled two motherless kittens.
Unlike “ J.P.’s” tripe hound, she did not consider
it any indignity, and was an assiduously attentive
foster parent.
DEAD EASY.
BILL : " Why, that’s the rich squatter! My oath,
you can’t judge a man by his clothes.”
THE OTHER: “No, but you can by his wife’s.”
AUSTRALIA STANDS ON GUARD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(With More Apologies to Grant Hervey.)
She stands, a lone-swept lady, with a hot sliprail in her
hand,
As they stood in old Trujillo when Pizarro found the
land ;
I can hear her—sunburnt, anxious—gaze out where the
Open Door
Ghves a glint of yellow color and a hint of Something
More.
Where the ships go speeding northward, their throttle
firm on the string",
And the junks come stealing- southward like buzzards
low on the wing ;
With an empty land, as silent as a barrel full of lard ;
As the Incas stood on Smyrna, so Australia stands on
guard.
The camp-fires gleam and glisten, on the blazed trail
north-away ;
The hour of Sunrise pulses, as on that blood-red day
When the pistons burned on the flangings, and the scream
of the twisted Night
Sprang back to the hand that felled it with steaks from
the Northern Light.
A nation calls on the hill-top, with a voice green-trimmed
and hard—
unfurl us the iron banner where Australia stands on
guard!
The drums of the Six-star nation roll out for the 1.0. U.;
They ring with the chant of Morning and the psalm of
the kangaroo ;
from the cape on the Portland tailings, and the steam-
bit camel train
They die, who have borrowed millions ; they starve, who
have pledged in vain !
She stands, sea-swept and lonely, with a whale-lance in
her hand,
As they stood in old Trujillo when Pizarro nailed the
land —
A sinew cracks in the clearing, like a shot through a
pawnshop card —
Hoi the Night gives ivay to Dawnness where Australia
stands on guard.

of last straw which, if it doesn’t break the camel’s back,
at least makes the animal sag down so that its stomach
rests on the earth. There are two such straws in your

With the aid of clever lawyers

tears in torrents.
Let her weep.... Poodgeregah : Incident small, and you
have not spun the yarn skilfully K.C. (V.): A feeble
parody of the song, and requires to be sung; and this
paper isn’t sure all its readers can sing W.A.R.
(N.S.W.): Insufficiently boiled address to dead aboriginal
king basketed. He can do without it now J.H. :
“ What Might Have Been ’’ will never be in these
columns 1.C.H.: Verses about the usual council row-
should fizzle all the time and boil over furiously in the

spectacled man trotting for his train L. Ound: Be-
lated and rough ...C.W.B. (V.): Sincere, rough work,
with the usual glaring technical faults of the beginner.
You try to rhyme “line” with “finds;” and absent-
mindedly couple “concealed” with “ feels.”.... W.V.L.
(Q.): In one verse you suddenly become very Scotch and
call home “hame” to get a rhyme for “fame.” The
poem has no value as a serious effort; but this is worth
preserving for its unconscious humor:
As I gaze on Australia’s summits,
That rise from the Eastern seas,
I doubt if the boasted Swiss hilltops
Can hold a candle to these —
My Mountains.
Listowel (V.): Poem entitled “Wow!” to hand.
Humor watery, and one or two of the attempted rhymes
are merely literary collisions L.G.V.It. : Declined
I.H. (Q.): “The Ball” is very unskilful and common-
place Ouondong : Unsuitable A.N.M. (V.): Dull
and rambling V. 0.8.: Judkinsin Heaven, protesting
against the importation of moving pictures showing the
fight between the Flesh and the Devil, is a bright idea.
The rest dull Camperdown : The Bulletin has no
such person on its staff. Whenever a man asks for
credit, on the representation that he is acting for The
Bulletin, he can be put down as a fraud.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
J,G.: There’s a fine of £l5O waiting for the next man
who suggest a drawing—“ The Anchor’s Wade.” And it
won’t be reduced even if the miscreant is a million-
aire. ...R.H.C.: Joke No. 1 evidently oozed out in

A MELBOURNE MIXTURE.


BUMBLE WADE, MRS. SOWERBERRY, AND A PARTY BEHIND THE DOOR.
“Oh, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,” said Mrs. Sowerberry. “ No boy in half his
senses could venture to speak so to you.”
“It’s not madness, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble; “it’s meat. You’ve overfed him,
ma’am. You’ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma’am. If you had kept the
boy on gruel, ma’am, this would never have happened.”
“Dear, dear,” ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, “this comes of being Liberal.”
“ Oliver Twist.”
The accounts of his ferocity, as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were
of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley before
opening the door.
“Do you know this here voice, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble. “Ain’t you afraid of
it, sir? Ain’t you a-trembling while I speak, sir?”
“No,” answered Oliver, boldly.

The degenerate Australian is still pushing.
Young Pike, of Arnoliffe (Sydney), the youth
who in his spare time made some extraordin-
ary experiments on the Marconi track, has
been appointed “wireless” officer on the
Canadian-Australian liner Manuka. Hitherto, he
has been a draughtsman for his bread and butter.
Died the other day, G. D. Guthrie,
owner for many years of the big Epsom pottery
works, near Bendigo (Vic.). At one time these
works, then run by a co., were about the biggest
of the kind in Australia. The co. struck rocks,
and then Guthrie pushed through on his own.
But the bottom fell out of the chief stand-by, the
drain-pipe business, when Monier concrete came
on the scene ; and for years past Epsom has lived
mostly on small goods.
THE SECRET EXPLAINED.
The Liberal candidate addressed a magnificent meeting
last evening, and was not subjected to a single interrup-
tion. —Tory Papers.
Died at Strathfield (N.S.W.), the other
day, H. S. Bird, who was shipping reporter on
Parkes’s Empire. In those times the shipping
reporter was a person of consequence : it was his
job to go as far out on the high seas as his stomach
and the office accountant would stand, and ran-
sack the ship for foreign news. When the Empire
failed, Mr. Bird got out of the Inky Way and
stepped over the page into Business, Bobbery, etc.
Startling advt. from the S, M. Herald of
one day last week :
YOUNG ENGLISH CLERGYMAN desires Acquaint-
ance with refined, educated gentlewoman (under
30), willing to give herself to God, view to early
Matrimony. Write in fullest confidence, giving age,
private means (if any), photo., etc., Alpha, Herald
Office, King-street, Sydney.
The reference to the private means recalls that, a
few days later, a Baptist president said that, his
tabernacle being short of money, he prayed to
God for £24, and got £lOO.
John Mackenzie, master mariner, got to
port last week. For many years he was a mem-
ber of the old Marine Board of N.S.W., and as
such used to grant the “ tickets” to marine officers.
When the old Board burst up, 10 years ago,
Mackenzie started a nautical school to coach can-
didates for these tickets. He also got a job as
nautical assessor on the Marine Court, and in that
capacity used to sit in judgment on the holders of
those certificates when vessels in their care came
to grief. “Old Mac” was one of the best-known
figures on the Sydney Exchange corner, and was
in the 70’s when apoplexy called him aloft.
Sydney Telegraph took the point, last
week, that C. G. Wade was a champion
footballer, captain of the Strathfield lawn-
tennis club, and so on, years ago ; and
that, therefore, he couldn't be an
incompetent administrator, and
“Liberalism” must be the right
ticket. It omitted to mention
that B. R. Wise—one of the
most prominent assailants of
Wade and “ Liberalism ”
was even more distinguished
as an athlete. Between 1879
and 1881 Wise was the ama-
teur mile champion of the
world. He founded, and was
first president of, the British
Athletic Association ; and he
represented Oxford on the
sports ground against Cam-
bridge with success for three
years. If there is anything in
the Telegraph’s queer conten-
tion, the case for Wise and
Labor looks fully as strong as
the case for Wade and “ Liberal-
ism.”
The moderately-new S. Aus.
Railway Commissioner Moncrieff,
who succeeded his old boss, Pendle-
ton, a few months back, is making a
bundle of changes. There used to be
a S. Australian traffic superintendent
(McArthur), who was supposed to look
after the whole job. Moncrieff has cut
the work in halves, and made Ben
Gillman passenger super, and G. J.
Smith good 3 boss ; and McArthur
has retired. Then McGuire,
who used to shove along the
Broken Hill seaboard traffic, has
been made “superintendent of sta-
tion services,” which seems to mean
that the capable McGuire is expected to do a
big job of staff-training and organising.
The new Anglican Dean of Melbourne,
Reginald Stephen, is an Australian native, born
at Geelong some 48 or 50 years ago. If Canon
Stephen is to keep up the average longevity of
his two predecessors, who came from the Cold
Country, he will have a long innings at the
Deanery. They totalled nearly 180 years between
them.
Just retired, Sammy Jones, General
Superintendent of Transportation in Victoria’s
railway service. Jones, who is 64 and has the
high-spirited appearance of a romantic bard, first
pushed a nib as a railway clerk 34 years ago, then
station-mastered all over the place, and finally
became Superintendent of Traffic at Ballarat and
at Flinders-street, Melbourne. He enjoyed his
final position for seven rich years, during which
he has been regarded by his juniors with some
symptoms of respect.
“ Chasuble ” : The new Dean of Mel-
bourne, succeeding Vance, promoted on to St.
Peter (against his will, of course), is
Stephen. People thought Archdeacon
Hindley would be after it; but the
prize is nothing like what is supposed.
About a decade ago, greatly to Vance’s
annoyance, the Diocesan Council made
an arrangement to come into force on
his retirement or demise. It was pro-
vided that, on Vance going out, the
screw should be much reduced—l think
from £lOOO to £6OO. Hindley, a very
able man, invented the Dioceses of
Bendigo, Wangaritta and Gippsland,
and could have had any of them. But
they are sadly non-cashable, and he is
better off as archdeacon. He succeeds
Vance at St. James’s, and I believe he
gets £BOO, against poor Stephen’s £6OO.
Stephen was one of the amazing first
flight of clerics turned out by Mel*
bourne’s Trinity College. They are
known as the “Gassh ’’—Bishop Green,
of Ballarat; Bishop Armstrong, of
Wangaratta ; Bishop Stretch, of New-
castle; Dean Stephen; and Vicar
Hughes, of St. Peter’s. After the
Gassh, Trinity ceased bearing—com-
paratively. That is to say, it turned
out only earnest average clergy, none shining in
the galaxy of stars.
From the Oldest Inhabitant :
Apropos the Coopers (B. 22/9/10). It is doubtful
whether Daniel and Thomas Cooper were “second-hand
dealers.” Certainly, Daniel, who came out first, became
a “dealer,” as every shopkeeper was called in the early
days ; but he dealt mostly, if not wholly, in new goods.
This Daniel also lent money, as shown by his evidence in
the trial of Worrall in 1g26. He married, had no children,
and left his wife in a brick vault in the old Sandhills
Cemetery (Sydney railway station site). Thomas Cooper
came afterwards. He was the first baronet’s father.
The original Daniel, having neither chick nor child, left
his nephews all his property. Daniel (the first Speaker
of N.S.W.) had the luck to get the south-of-the-harbor
properties ; John, who is still living, aged 81 last June,
got the North Shore lands.
Russia seems to take little interest in those
of its citizens who get into trouble in foreign
countries. When 17-year-old Boris Senkovitch,
charged with the murder of his mate, appeared at
Melbourne City Court prior to being remanded to
Sydney, nobody represented him, and the inter-
preter, not being a lawyer, permitted him to make
an admission that counsel would have choked
before it got out of his mouth. There was a large
difficulty in getting even an interpreter; the con-
sulate, when appealed to, remarked wearily that
there were but few of the Tsar’s subjects in Mel-
bourne, and it had no Russo-English linguist on
the premises.
REASONS ENOUGH.
MINISTER : “ Mackintosh, why don't
you come to church now ? ”
MACKINTOSH: “ For three reasons, sir. Fairstly,
I dinna like yer theology; secondly, I dinna
like yer singni; and, thairdly, it was in your
kirk I fairst, met ma wife.”
London Daily Mail mentions Lord
Dudley as firs; favorite for the Garter which
Death removed last month from the aged leg of
Earl Spencer. A fairer thing would be to bestow
the gaud on the gentleman whom the King acci-
dentally shot the other day. It might solace him
for his agonies; and there could be no valid
objection. Palmerston used to say that the
feature of a K.G.-ship that most appealed to him
was the fact that it didn’t stand for “ any d d
merit.”
That tremendous blue-blood, Arthur
Gordon, who used to be High Commissioner for
the Western Pacific and Governor of liji, still
makes part of his fat living out of
the islands. When some ancient
beachcombers reckoned that there
ought to be money in the little
things "that the seabirds of ages
had left behind them, Gordon
—Lord Stanmoreof nowadays
—was invited to take a hand.
First the Pacific Islands Co.
was formed, and then the
Pacific Phosphate Co., with
the ex-Governor as chair-
man ; and the manure is
making a mint of money for
the baron. They don’t shout
their proceedings from the
Mansion House steps ; but it
is said that “ iStanrytore’s Co.”
paid 35 per cent, in dividends
last year. Also, it issued an-
other 375,000 shares and credited
them all round with 6s. Bd., equal to
a little bonus of £125,000. Besides the
English co. of which Stanmore is chairman, there
are French and German guano cos. on the job ;
but the ancient ambassador—he is now 81—seems
to have fixed up an “honorable understanding,”
and it is hard to tell where one leaves off and the
other begins.
Rather late in life’s season, Tasmania’s
bright Labor M.H.A., W. A. Woods (“John
Drayman ”), late editor of Hobart Clipper,
has set an example to his bachelor chief,- “Jack ”
Earle, M.H.A. Miss Watkins, sister to the
youthful Labor-member Ben, is the lady who
helped him to do it.
Admiral Henderson, who is reporting on
naval matters for the Commonwealth, has two
mariner brothers who have also climbed to flag
positions. The first is Admiral William Hender-
son, who joined the service in 1859, and came to
Australia as chief of H.M.S. Nelson in 1881.
The other brother, Rear-Admiral Frank Hender-
son (retired), took some pugnacious part in the
Ashantee scrimmage of 74, the Egyptian diver-
sion of ’B2, and a Sierra Leone commotion in ’9B.
The present visitor, who has had a more placid
existence, came to this country in the frigate
Phoebe in 1869, and then numbered Captain
Creswell among his “ middies.” Creswell ac-
companies his superior on the present cruise
through the Australian dominions.
“C.M.G-.”: I see The Bulletin recom-
mends that the proposed statue to Tom Bent of
blessed memory should be composed of mud.
But I have a better suggestion. The strenuous
efforts of 12 months have enabled desperate col-
lectors to get together a fund of £l5O. This would
hardlydefray the costof a life-sized mud monument.
Now, Tom Bent, when in the flesh, often boasted
that he built the first chimney erected at Brighton.
That chimney still stands. Why not purchase it,
remove it bodily to a suitable site, inscribe a verse
of one of Tommy’s comic songs on each hob, and
let T. Bent be recollected by the noblest work of
his life ?
Charles Sawbones, M.D. :
Judkins, to me, is merely the name of some irritating
complaint like hay fever. 1 have never seen him ; but his
designation is familiar tome through the newspapers, and
I know that there are periodical outbreaks of Judkins.
These points of resemblance induce me to believe that
Judkins is not a person at all, but a small disorder. I
would not know Judkins from the bacteria of cold feet if
I saw them both under the microscope. I don’t think
Judkins, cold feet, toothache, influenza, chilblains or red
nose will ever die out. I never expect to hear that
Judkins has left the country, any more than I expect to
hear that Mumps has been locked up on a charge of being
drunk whilst driving a horse and cart, or that Rheu-
matism has sold up his immense business and invested all
his capital in Portugal. Try as I will, I cannot picture
Judkins as a real, live human being, whose hat can be
knocked over his eyes and whose head can feel the thud
of an avenging brolly. To me, he is something that breaks
out and rages and has to be fought with cooling drinks,
ice, perfect quiet, liver pills and hot bottles to the
extremities. Would any sane person hesitate for a
moment if he saw Gout on a tram or Cold-in-the-Head
coming out of a pub? Of course not! The trouble would
be seized, handed over to a policeman, tried and deported.
My firm conviction is that Judkins escapes this fate
because he is an epidemic. You can’t arrest and deport
an epidemic. You have to fight it scientifically with
medicine, nursing and perfect quiet.
Brother John Yerran is still busy knocking
the bottom out of the old gag that when the
Labor party got into power nobody would get
more than Bs. a day or thereabouts. On behalf of
the S. Australian Government, he has just en-
gaged Professor Lowrie to boss the Agricultural
Department at a salary of £1250. Lowrie, who is
the usual Scotchman, was boss cocky in S. Aus-
tralia once before, and on his record then he
would probably be cheap at £5OOO a year. It was
he who taught the dusty State to use super-
phosphates ; and “ super ” is now worth anything
over half a million a year to Yerran s dominions.
Speaker Jenkin Coles, an expert on the subject,
estimated a while ago that the chemical had added
at least £1 an acre, as an average, to the wheat-
growing territory of S. Australia.
Some early Sydney residents had better
public spirit than many modern ones. There were
no doubt cormorants in those early days; but
they weren’t all birds of that breed. When the
city wanted to stretch uphill, past Woolloomooloo,
Judge Dowling, who owned the land thereabouts,
said to the City Council: “ Here, take thus piece
for a street, I give it for nothing. ihat is
now Victoria-street. Similarly he passed over
Brougham-street, Duke-street and Dowlmg-
street. Certainly, the city extensions improved
the balance of his property. But Judge Dowling
and other ancients admitted the fact, and allowed
for it. To-day’s cormorants, while knowing .hat
what is left will be vastly improved, howl furi-
ously, and put up their demands for compensa-
tion to a dizzy height.
A politician whose reputation seems to
have slumped of late is Attorney-General Hughes.
He was always known as a parish-minded man
with an intensely local outlook. In fiscal matters
he was in the same camp with Bruce bmith and
M‘Millan and the Akgus and all the worst ele-
ments of Toryism, and it was significant of the
popular opinion regarding him that many people
took it for granted that he was a Foreign-trader,
not from conviction, but because his waterside
constituents make wages by unloading for^,B n
goods from cheaply-manned foreign ships, ihe
agility with which he skimmed along the
very brink of trouble in the Bowling affair
was considered by many to be more agile
than commendable. The blunders made by the
Fisher Government over some features of the
Australian Notes Bill and Land lax Bill didn t
boost up his legal reputation. And then came
the amusing, though as yet uncorroborated, story
told by the man who sued him for damage and
assault, said to have been suffered when he was
a tenant on shares of the farm where Hughes
used to keep the famous sick cow.

THE GAOL CURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the Prahran (Vic.) Court a man was proceeded
against for having failed to send his boy to school. He
stated that, as he left home at 7 o’clock, he was not in a
position to see that the boy went to school.
Mr. Phipps, J.P.: “ Why don't they send a lad like that
on board the training-ship?”
Major Clipperton, J.P. : “He ought to be put in the
cell for an hour.” — Argus (2719/'10).
Young Jimmy has his back up ; he will not haste to
school —
All day to sit and whet his wit where tender teachers rule.
He will not do his “ecker” as a decent nipper should,
Nor learn up Asia’s rivers for his sometime-later good.
Is the little devil lazy ?
Is he bad, or is he crazy ?
He shall go to school, or suffer—we, the Law, will be
obeyed !
It is really past a joke !
Jimmy’s spirit must be broke —
Let us gaol the little blighter as an educative aid!
Though mulish men oppose us with a will they call their
own,
It’s not for Law V Order (us !) to leave the kid alone !
When Freedom (ours !) is threatened, at Duty’s stern
behest
We’ll bang the opposition down and sit upon its chest.
We’ve had our lessons set us !
In the name of Freedom, let us
Rise and make the-rebel youngster feel the prickings of
remorse.
In the dark and musty cell
Let the little devil smell
The gyve, the irons, the gallows—educatively, of course !
VICTORIA.

WHAT TO DO
FOR INDIGESTION.
Modern Methods for Treating a
Common Complaint*
+
Whatever the causes may be, and there appear
to be a number, indigestion and stomach troubles
are on the increase. In treating this troublesome
and often painful complaint, the sufferer ought, to
recognise that there is a cause for it, and try to
eliminate the cause. This is the way to obtain a
permanent cure. Now the following are facts. A
weak stomach cannot digest food properly—hence
dyspepsia after meals. Laxatives only help to
move the meal along, and predigested invalid
foods do not give the stomach its own work to do.
Therefore, whatever is the cause of a weak
stomach, indigestion and stomach trouble will
prevail until the stomach is made stronger—strong
enough to digest ordinary food without pain or
inconvenience. Acting on this principle a great
many sufferers have been cured of severe indiges-
tion by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They supply
the stomach with the strength it needs by enrich-
ing and purifying the blood. Pure blood gives
tone to the nerves, muscles and glands of the
stomach and makes it capable of properly per-
forming the work of digestion. The case of Mrs.
M. J. Pasche, Eighth Street, Port Pirie, S.A.
shows how good they are in stomach trouble.
“Indigestion crept on me by slow stages,” she
said. “Directly after eating anything I’d feel
the food lying on my chest, just at the end of my
breast bone, and under my shoulder blades I
would feel the same heavy weight. The weight
in my chest was so real to me that I would think
if I could only get it up by any means I would get
relief. The food caused a great swelling and ful-
ness in the chest. I could only breathe with
difficulty and my clothes always felt tight on me,
so that t would have to loosen them. Some days
I would feel ill for the whole time, other times the
attacks might stay on me for three hours at a
stretch. Not a week passed but I would get a
severe headache all over my head, I would gener-
ally wake up with it. It was as much as I could
do to lift my head off the pillow. The attacks
would get stronger as the day Wore on. I was
home with my mother and sisters at the time, else
I could not have got through any housework.
Some days I would have to go and lie down, I
would feel so wretchedly ill. I was thin and de-
bilitated, my color turned to a sickly yellow hue,
and my appetite failed me. There were days
when I simply couldn’t touch anything. I suffered
greatly from wind, especially round the heart.
As to my nerves, they were in a shocking state, I
would shake all over if I were startled at all, and
I would jump at any sudden noise. I never cared
to go out, but Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me
so effectively that I’ve never had a relapse. I
took one after each meal, and from the first they
picked me up wonderfully. My appetite improved,
and presently I could eat a hearty meal, and not
feel half the pain I used to. I kept on taking
them, and I lost that sallowness and my head-
aches went away. Before 'the third box was
empty every symptom had disappeared.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by chemists
and storekeepers, or sent by mail, post paid on
receipt of price, 2s. 9d. per box, 6 boxes 15s. 3d.,

POLITICAL
POINTS
“ Jock ” Garland, Wade’s henchman, was
spreading himself recently on how the wicked
Federal tariff had increased the cost of living. It
went down all right till Labor-candidate Car-
michael blew along the next evening and inquired
if it was the wicked tariff that had increased the
price of bricks by 25 per cent., or was responsible
for the all-round rise in rents.
A NEW SHRIEK FOR COCKY.
Many farmers had made a rod for their backs by sup-
porting the Labor party.... As a retribution they were
getting the land tax and the Arbitration Act.... The
Opposition intended to go through Australia explaining
these measures.— Speech at National Ass. meeting in S. A.
STOUT POLITICIAN : “ Come, pretty cocky, when
anybody mentions ‘Land tax ’ say ‘Ini-
quitous.’”
A vague report circulates to the effect that
Premier Wade’s devotion to duty may cost him
his life. A base character is said to have left his
home somewhere, declaring that he will not return
until he has slain Gregory. When last seen he
was armed with a cannon, two rifles, a revolver, a
spear, a booinerang, a fierce dog and a club. Wade
intends to sell his life dearly and has bought a
harpoon, an assagai, a pound of dynamite, a
mitrailleuse, an axe and a lion. Great excitement
prevails.
Extract from a speech by Fitzpatrick
(M.L.A.) at Orange (N.S.W.): —
There are only' two ways of acquiring land—by stealing
it or paying for it. The Wade Government believes in
buying and paying for the land.
Evidently, Fitzpatrick never heard of (1) inherit-
ing land ; (2) having land given to you ; (3) being
the First Man and being simply dropped on the
land. Does Fitzpaddy regard Mr. Adam Genesis
as a land-buyer or a thief ? Also, what is his view
about Mr. Noah Genesis, who came along some
time later ? If they were buyers, did they buy
the land from God, and if they were thieves,
did they steal the land from God ? And
when Victoria and other British sovereigns
assumed the possession of land in Australia and
distributed it to the settlers, how did they come
by it? It is quite certain that they didn’t buy it
from the aborigines, therefore did they steal it ?
Has Fitzpatrick the courage to dance a war-dance
alongside the Queen Victoria statue at the top of
King-street, Sydney, and declare that the lady it
is intended to commemorate was a robber ?
Much hustling after the odd tuppence has
left its mark on Sydney’s dailies. The other
day, for instance, the Evening News advanced
the crushing theory that no one in search of divi-
dends would put a “red cent” into the proposed
Port Darwin railway if it were built in a straight
line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. The News
is probably right. Also the News would probably
not put a carmine sou into a Pah’f’l, or a crimson
copper into a lighthouse, or a purple penny into a
quarantine station. Still it has a friendly feeling
for the Pah’f’l, and up to now it hasn’t proposed
to drop lighthouses and quarantine stations out of
the scheme of things.
The Vic. Government’s refusal to accept
the nomination of a very elderly officer to the billet
formerly adorned by the whiskers of Jen-
kins has spurred the House of Fat to show
its false teeth. Manifold, M.L.C., moved
the adjournment by way of a hint to the
Government, and the House carried the
motion by an ominous 17 to 12. Manifold
quoted figures in defence of the policy of
dropping nice old gentlemen into nice, soft
billets. A way-back Clerk of the Council
was, it seems, 65 when he was appointed,
and “he did his work satisfactorily till he
was 74” ; therefore the President’s nomina-
tion of a comparative youngster of 68 ought
to be accepted. Other angry legislators
protested against the Government’s “direct
attack on the rights and privileges of the
Chamber,” and M’Whae remarked that
“ too much was heard from the Ministry
about the uselessness of the Council.” The
vote vindicated the Fatmen’s right to have
even a centenarian for Clerk if they feel
that his antiquity would be soothing;
and it indicated also that they haVe a
majority in favor of further proving their
“ usefulness” when Government Bills come
along.
An amazing proposition was advanced
during the debate on the Federal Land Tax Bill
by Hedges, of Westralia, backed by Mahon,
the disgruntled Labor ex-Minister who was left
out of the Fisher Government. It was to the
effect that, if a man bought land from the State,
the amount which he paid for it should be exempt
from taxation. Of course, if this principle was
admitted, it would be impossible to refuse a
similar exemption to the man who bought from
the Bank of N.S.W. or the man who bought from
anybody. Yet the question was argued quite
gravely for an hour or so.
“H.J.D.”: Sydney Telegraph has dis-
covered, apropos the Rev. T. S. Crawford’s candi-
dature for Marrickville, that “ the Church should
not dabble in politics.” What I rise to inquire
is—why, if a parson is reckoned good enough to
occupy an editorial chair, one may not occasion-
ally befoundwhoisgood enough tofilla law-maker’s
pew ? If parsons are fitted to review, direct, and
dictate the policy of legislators from a newspaper
office, where is the harm in attempting a similar-
job in Parliament ? I await an answer from up-
holders of such rabid politicians as the Rev. John
West, the Rev. Dr. Garran, and the Rev. Wil-
liam Curnow. Also, a reply would be pleasing
from the Telegraph’s own Rev. Dr. F. W. Ward.
Thus the S. M. Herald (29/9/TO) :
It was, of course, never intended that the Common-
wealth should intervene in State industrial matters.
Possibly—but are remarks like these worth
making ? It was never intended at the beginning
of things that Sydney should ever have 600,000
people, or that the S. M. Herald should become
the profitable property it is, or that ships should
travel by steam, or that there should be trains,
tram-cars, printed books or balloons. But these
things came. And if the States declare at the
next referendum that they intend now that the
Commonwealth shall intervene in State industrial
matters, what does it signify that they possibly
didn’t intend it at some bygone period ?
It has been a cold week for the Aus-
tralian Tory. Almost every day came tidings of
new sorrow. First, there was the news that
Britain proposes to go in for payment of mem-
bers. It is rough on the Tory, who has always
pointed to Bull’s honorary legislator as the great
example to be followed, that Bull should thus
declare his own honorary legislator to be some-
thing of a failure. Then the local Tory was j ust
making his usual remark about the alleged preva-
lence of strikes in Australia, and how shocked
Bull was thereat, when the cable men-
tioned all in one day that 30,000 English miners
had gone on strike, and that 150,000
cotton spinners had been locked out—which
was pretty good for one day. And he was inter-
rupted in the middle of an observation about the
tendency of Australian legislation to drive capital
out of the country by the news that four big
English agricultural landlords are trying to dis-
pose of their properties in order to get away from
the Government’s new taxes. Possibly they in-
tend to flee to Australia as a place of refuge.
From Sydney Telegraph (26/9/TO) :
For 25 years I have been working hard to get a railway
superannuation fund. It used to break my heart almost
to see old men dispensed with, having only a few pounds
in their pockets, and not being lit for any other occupa-
tion. Mr. Wade was the first Premier who had the
pluck to carry this bill through, enabling men, afLer
completing their years of service, to retire on enough to
keep them, and no longer burdened with the fear of
going on the world as paupers.— Mr. Harry Richardson,
Assistant Railioay Commissioner, at Hornsby.
The Bulletin doesn’t mind ; but it hopes Assist-
ant Railway Commissioner Richardson will go on
forgetting Regulation 299Q£Z77 the next time some
goods porter is haled up for loosing his lips on
behalf of, say, the Labor candidate for Darling
Harbor. And, anyhow, as to Wade, there’s not
much pluck required to shove a thing like Rail-
way Superannuation through on the eve of an
election. The pluck will be required to keep it
moving a few years hence.
When Premier Weary took office in Vic-
toria, he was going to inaugurate a term of re-
sponsible government; he and his Ministers
would do the work they were expected to do, and
not shove it on to irresponsible bodies. Well,
to-day he has commissions inquiring into the
Cohuna land scandal, the Central Station con-
tract, the metropolitan passenger traffic and
noxious trades ; there are select committees pon-
dering the metropolitan tramway fares and the
ways of trading companies; there are depart-
mental boards scrutinising the evidence of seven
different railway casualties, certain irregularities
at Kew asylum and other matters. A great bogger-
in is Weary, and a most energetic upholder of Re-
sponsible Government.
In spite of the calm assurance of the
Sydney morning press that “ the great heart of
the people is beating fast for Liberalism,” the
only Minister who has dared to trust the great
heart of even his own electorate, and skirl round
the country, is the Premier himself. The same
papers have been crying to Ashton, Garruthers,
and other alleged Samsons of the Liberal party to
come forth and swing a jawbone on behalf of the
struggling cause. But, so far, the jawbone has re-
mained in sweet repose. And as Ashton and
Carruthers have not openly changed their spots,
it looks as though those cunning old campaigners
don’t want to have their jawbones mixed up with
a tragedy.
FAT PHRASEOLOGY.
Mr. Kelly (N.SAV.) said that the present project was
revolutionary, and subversive of all principles of sound
finance.... The position was alarming. “This proce-
dure,” continued Mr. Kelly, “is one which will land this
country in the most complex financial quagmire which it
is possible to conceive. If this sort of thing is to go on
in future no man will know,” etc., etc.— A recent and
familiar form of debate.
GRANNY: "It do be wonderful ’ow the little dear
gets it all off pat. 'E’s a credit to th'
family, 'e is!”
John Murray’s weak truckling to the
Victorian House of Landlords at its June elec-
tions, instead of fighting it tooth and nail, is
bringing its own reward. The Landlords were
expected, in return, to be sweetly reasonable and
to swallow, if they couldn’t digest, the few demo-
cratic measures the Weary One was likely to send
them. Now they have “adjourned”—that is to
say, they have gone out on strike—because
Murray declined their nomination of an ancient
for an easy job in Parliament House. And the
day after this “adjournment” ebullition they
showed their sweetly reasonable temper by cutting
out of the Electoral Bill the only provisos that
made it an improvement on the existing Act. So
John learns that the Fats are like low-class
niggers—they take generosity as a sign of weak-
ness, and concession as a sign of fear.
There has been a big increase in the cost
of building lately, and “right-thinking people”
have been asking those who have had to do the
paying how they like (1) Protection ; (2) these
Arbitration and Wages-Board Acts? Now, ap-
parently to make it awkward for the “right-
thinking people,” the Australian Brick Works,
Ltd., issues a prospectus in Sydney, and
puts the matter this way, on the basis of
past operations : “ Cost of turning out bricks, 21s.
per 1000. Price received for bricks at kiln, 425.
per 1000. An output of 200,000=£420 per week.
Less cost of manufacture, £2lO per week. Net
profit per week, £210.” That is to say, 100 per
cent, profit. It looks as though the right-thinking
person yelled “ Protection ” and “Wages Boards”
so as to give his friend Private Enterprise a
chance to go through the public a little more com-
fortably and thoroughly. In the best pockht-
picking circles they call this familiar process
“buttoning.”
AN APT PUPIL.
I have always thought Yass-Canberra the prettiest
site, though my preference has always been for Dalgety.
— Mr. Fisher.
GEORGE REID : “ Take it, old man — it’s yours.”
One of Premier Wade’s handicaps has
been his unfortunate choice or accident of sup-
porters at big meetings. One Burns sup-
ported a vote of thanks to. Wade at Welling-
ton (N.S.W.). Wade had been charged with
side-stepping a number of searching questions put
to him, whereupon Wade’s advocate poured out
oil this wise :
Some of those present were not workers. 4 They were
only insects preying on the workers. So long as they
could get a little dole from the wages of the workers
every week, that was the extent of their real sympathy.
For their class, there ivas only one system of legislation,
and that was the kind dealt out to Peter Bowling. The
cry of “blackguard” was heard sometimes, bi xFsome of
those present were horn with the brand on them, and
would die with the leg-irons on them.
All of which is calculated to do the- tottering
cause of Toryism much- good, and help Wade
prove to a sympathetic audience that the Labor
people are vile slanderers and cowardly de-
tainers. , iii
Postmaster-General Thomas said from a
Melbourne pulpit that a great many people go
short of the necessaries of life that a few may
enjoy the luxuries of civilisation, and the Argus
was down on him like a ton of building material.
“ Poisonous untruth ! ” cried the Immense Daily.
“ Blackest of falsehoods ! ”
A beggar comes for alms to a cottage door. Is it true
that the beggar exists in order that there may be com-
fort in the cottage? If one man gets seven shillings a
day while another gets fourteen, does the seven-shillings-
a-day man receive the smaller wage in order that the
other may get a higher?
That settles it, of course, and entirely abolishes
the fatuous idea that anything in the nature of
unequal distribution of wealth exists anywhere.
The only wholesome truth lies in the fine old
Tory principle that the man with ten thousand a
year exists in order to pay a lot of inferior work
people 3s. a day, which is invariably more than
they earn, and always more than is good for
them.
From “R. H. Bowden,” who writes from
(W.A.): —
Having just got back from Tanami, and travelled the
Northern Territory route, I will perhaps be allowed a say
to my fellow-Australians re the railway. lam convinced
now that The Bulletin is right in advocating the straight
line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta, instead of the
crooked line from the Territory into Queensland. The
Territory is a vast place and wants opening up, and this
can only be done by railway ; and a straight line with
branches will open it up best and at least cost. The
country is marked “Desert” on the map. That is
because it is unexplored. Some of the country is good,
some fair, some desert. In most places the soil is good ;
but those places haven’t always got a rainfall. If the
straight line were built, branch lines could be made from
the trunk, sav, into Queensland towards Cainooweal ;
and, if Tanami' should go ahead, another from, say, Ten-
nants’s Creek or Barrow Creek westward, perhaps into
Kimberley. That would be opening up a lot more coun-
try than by the route into Queensland. It would also be
the best, looking at it from a defence point of view. It
ought to be viewed as a national undertaking there is
none that would be more for the benefit of Australia as a
whole.
THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I found that the district had for some years carried a
much denser population, but that the land, which had
been taken up in small selections of 320 acres, had fallen
into the hands of comparatively few individuals. . ..
That was a state of affairs for which nobody could be
blamed, which, though regrettable, had to be faced in
the natural order of things.— Fowler, M.P., on the
Federal Land Tax.
It’s the old, old song, as old as the grave,
That the hard-shell Tory sings;
He sang it of old in his damp, dark cave,
And oft in his sleep he’d mutter and rave
Of “ the natural order of things.”
In the bad old days ’twas the biggest stick,
And the hawk with the strongest wings,
And the men that could straightest throw a brick—
And out went the slow, and the small, and the sick
In “ the natural order of things,”
But the Tory then, as he does to-day
(Although time its changes brings),
Still said that this was the regular way,
That ever must talon and beak hold sway—
’Twas “the natural order of things.”
So whenever he biffs the weak man out,
To the vile old gag he clings ;
And every time that he lands a clout
You can hear Fat dance and can hear him shout:
It’s “the natural order of things."
And whether he uses a stick or gold,
Or whatever the change he rings,
He lands his prey as he did of old ;
And if any complain they are promptly told
It’s “ the natural order of things ! ”
He makes no question of right or wrong,
As the grist to his mill it brings ;
But ever we hear the rich and strong
Roaring together the same old song :
It’s “ the natural order of things! ”
VICTORIA.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, October 4, 1910.
My Dear Arint, —
Lady Dudley interrupted her long rest cure by
coming with a large party to the first day of the
A. J.C. Spring meeting. She came in soft white
satin with a coat of black ninon, a rope of pearls
twisted several times round her neck, and a hat
that would please the birds and the humans that
love the birds. It had no feathers, only some big,
wired bows of yellowish lace. Lady Poore’s long,
Irish crochet coat—down to the tail of her frock
nearly—covered something creamy and filmy, and
her hat was not of battleship build. It was of
the little torpedo type.
The two biggest hats at the meeting were worn
by Miss Maie Peach and bv Mrs. Fisher, wife of a
local medical man, and said to be a Maorilander.
The hat of the latter lady must have been three
feet across. It seemed to be of white satin,
with white plumes, and it extinguished her as
effectually as a light is hid by a billycan.
Miss Eadith Walker’s was one of the most
artistic gowns of Saturday: Black ninon over
white satin, something grey and something
aluminium. Ninon over satin of another shade
was in the ascendant. Mrs. Hugh Denison was a
golden brown study, and had pale-toast feathers
in her big hat. There were not as many freak
frocks as I expected. Mrs. de Wyn’s corkscrew
costume of black and grey ninon, with royal
blue and black stripes, was one of the freakiest.
Probably the costliest gown on the course was a
gold tissue oversewn with semi-precious stones,
worn by a Melbourne visitor. Miss Noni Hay’s
black and white check, with an inverted
black work-basket hat wearing a bunch of royal
blue feathers, was one of the prettiest things
in the line of elegant simplicity. This damsel’s
photograph, I may say en passant, hangs now in
the Hotel Australia gallery of beauties. A won-
derfully artistic picture it is, with a suggestion as
of firelight shining on the lowered face and breast
of the figure.
The narrow - skirt - muzzled - below-the- knees
fashion is a horrible re vealer of big feet—which fact
is one of the things that will kill it. There was a
girl at Saturday’s meet, quite a youngster, with
a short, in-custody frock, and boots with antelope-
cloth tops. Well, her feet—no, her yards —took
up more space of grass than any one pair of feet
have a right to unless it is by right of purchase.
She could not help the size of her lower supports,
but the width of herskirt was her own affair.
Mrs. Willie Kelly, who, with her husband, is over
from Melbourne, had one of the new Assam linen
coats and skirts with the braiding known as
soutache. Mis. Bertie Kelly was holding a
children’s revel at her home; and therefore was
absent from Randwick. Another good-frocker,
Mrs. Arthur McArthur, was an absentee through
a bad attack of mumps.
The past seven days have been festive ones. On
Thursday Mrs. Harry Levy gave a big dance at
Baumann’s to celebrate the launching of her
eldest daughter on the social sea. The heroine
of the occasion is tall, slight and remarkably
pretty. This was one of the few dances in the
history of Sydney where there were rather more
than enough dancing males to go round.
On Friday the Knoxes had a party, and on
Saturday the Arthur Allens uproseand entertained
a modest little band of 112 souls to “ Our Miss
Gibbs.” This is probably a Sydney record in the
theatre-party line. Most of the guests arrived
punctually to time, and it was impressive to
watch them surging in like the Assyrian de-
scending on the stalls or what not. The job of
handling them would have unnerved any check-
takers less capable and icy-calm than J.C.W.’s.
On the same night a herd of hospitable bachelors
bade their friends to a ball at the A.B.C.
rooms. The younger members of the Arthur Allen
party arrived within about four minutes of the
formal betrothal of Miss Gibbs. Dancing ceased
in time to avoid Sabbath-fracturing, and there-
after supper was served —eating being regarded as
a recreation which the veriest Puritan may in-
dulge in on the Lord’s Day. Simultaneously an
At Home was raging aboard the Cambrian,
so the young and frivolous were amply catered for
one way and the other.
A rumor has been running over the town with
20-centipede power that the lease of Her Majesty’s
Theatre has been acquired by the Clarke, Meynell
co. The rumor raced too fast, for the lease has
yet three years to run, and much may happen in
three years—or, for that matter, three seconds. An
animal with four legs, one at each corner, elon-
gated his neck at last Saturday’s Epsom and
pushed his nose ahead of a noble steed named
Flavinius (on which I had my money) and won
the race. It was all done in three seconds.
The quadruped who poked his nose where it
was not wanted by those who hadn’t backed him
wasnamed Silver Hampton. But to get back to the
H.M. proposition : The property on which the
theatre stands could be bought for £140,000, and
several theatres might be built for that wealth.
Two theatres are going up near the Haynmrket,
so there is no immediate fear of the drama,
whether of the bellow or legitimate order, becom-
ingahomeless waif. The offices of J.C. W., Ltd.,
are to be removed to the Theatre Royal from Her
Majesty’s. Probably that is why the rumor
started its spi-int.
Talking of building, Sydney’s strife for higher
things is evidenced in that nine-storey structure,
“Terranora,” which has gone up near the Quay,
close to Bulletin Place. You pass it by and
take no notice; it is just as most brick-and-
mortar crudities are in the making. But, viewed
from any of the ’ferry steamers, it looks quite
New Yorkish, bald and convincingly business-
like. It is a University speculation, and will be
let for business premises. The highest building
in Sydney, when it is completed, will be “Wyom-
ing,” in Macquarie-street. This will run to 12
storeys. Suites of flats is its purpose in the life
of the community.
A humorous by-product of the “Our Miss
Gibbs” show is the rush thereward of Sydney
shop-assistants. By now. all our beauteous floor-
walkers and show-room ladies have studied the
demeanor of the manager of Garrods’ Stores,
which is modelled on the best traditions of the
“Walk this way, madam,” courtesy. They
approve of it, with the exception—and it is a
big one—that it is not usual for a manager to
hold the hands of Our Miss Anybody when he
sympathises with her in little troubles, nor is it
the thing for her to put her hands on his shoul-
ders when appealing for his sympathy.
The gallery of Garrods’ Stores, with its model
hats and silk underskirts laid over the railing, is
the cynosure of feminine eyes, often to the ex-
clusion of the farce that tumbles about on the
floor of the shop. Some of Lassetters’ showroom
maidens are nightly serving imaginary customers
up in that gallery. They glide about as on in-
visible skates, match bunches of feathers,
remove one Dreadnought hat from a steel
rod and put another in its place, and
look to the nice conduct of a cerise
princess petticoat, all with expert know-
ledge of the job. It was with some difficulty
that Williamson Limited got the Lassetterites,
but by now half the local Garrod girls have a
fancy for a billet in the phantom showroom.
“Tell me where is fancy bred?” Eh? “It is
engendered in the head, by gazing fed ” ; and
after they have gazed for 20 minutes at the easy
work of the silent sellers, the latter seem to be
“ really on the stage.” The glamor of the actress
is on them. Then : “ I could do as well as that
and look a great deal better ” is the natural
sequence.
The would-be Gibbsian girl is already numerous.
As for the real one, little Miss Blanche Brown-
well, after her very first performance she was in
the winter garden of the Australia with six of our
well-known gilded youths, seated in semi-circle
formation before her. It is true that some gilded
youths have low foreheads like a hen and the
Emperor Honorius ; but a large amount of cash
sometimes compensates for an inch and a half of
forehead.
Miss Katherine Grey will be back in Sydney on
the 15th to open in “ Paid in Full,” an American
drama. Her new leading man, Mr. Desmond, a
New York matinee idol, arrived here early this
week by the Zealandia. “Salvation Nell,” a
slum play, will most likely be another of the Grey
pieces. Eugene Waller, the writer of “Paid in
Full” and “Salvation Nell”—a Mrs. Fisk success
—was at the undergraduate stage when he
wrote them, and even now he is not more than 23.
The new actor-man Desmond is married to Miss
Lily O’Neil, a sister of the colossal Nance.
Have just been looking at the portrait of
another American matinee idol, Mr. Jack Barry-
more (portrait published on his engagement to a
Miss Harris), and learn from the letterpress that
it was only in the June of this year that Barry-
more’s managers insured him against marriage
for £lO,OOO. They reckoned that as a married
man the matinde girl would become critical about
his acting, stay away in hundreds from his per-
formances, and presently love another who was
not fettered by holy matrimony. But, if they
had asked advice of their wives, they would have
learned that an engaged man is just as uninter-
esting as a married one—to the girl who doesn’t
wear his ring.
What a number of holes will be knocked in
Sydney society next year ! So many persons are
going hence—“ for the coronation,” of course. It
is always for that ceremony they will go. If all
the people who are “going to the coronation”
from everywhere were to get a view of the cere-
mony, the theatre of the crowning would have to
be as big as Tasmania, and the spectators would:
want the wonderful long-distance sight of an eagle.
Amongst departers of this week will be the
Claude Macdonalds. The Ramaciottis—father,
mother, son and daughter—go early next year.
The Ramaciottis will most likely have quite
a choice knot-hole in Westminster Abbey
through which to view the show, for Mr.
H., senior, will go as Colonel Ramaciotti.:
Amongst other dissipations in which he will in-j
dulge are army manoeuvres in Germany, Italy and;
France. Other departers who go by the Malwa.l
trip after next, will be the Hamilton Dobbies of
Double Bay.
The Claude Macdonalds, of Wantabadgery;
station, are paying their final visit to Sydney.:
When they leave in a few weeks’ time, they leave
for good, regardless of graduated land-taxes andj
other Labor devices to keep them with us. The
lady is convalescent after her motor-accident, andj
was able to struggle to the races on Saturday, and!
even to get round a little with the help of friends
and a stick.
Passengers by the incoming Seydlitz are Mrs. :
and Miss Rosina Pinhey. The younger lady, it
will be remembered, had, as Rosina Svdna, capital
chances in grand opera in Italy, but the cold of
European winters bit into the voice mechanism of ;
this child of the sun, and, for fear of damaging it
permanently, she returns to give it a summer-time
or two for recuperation.
Mumps is the word. Nearly everyone has;
them. Unfortunately they are always plural.
Mayoress Allen Taylor has' had them. Aide-de-
camp Layton, of the Town Hall, has had them,
too, and half the officials of that fairly noble pile
are, or have been, laid aside. And it’s about
“evens” that the doctors they ring up to come
and cure them are also in the mumps themselves.
The last of “Jack” Want’s brothers died last
week. He was Sydney Alfred, the youngest of ,:
the family of Randolph Want, the old-time lawyer.
At a meeting of the Fresh Air League ball;
committee, held one recent morning in the Town
Hall, a gratified hon. treasurer told a number of;
smiling dames that £316 some shillings and a few
pence had been realised.
Dinna forget the splendid programme for the;
concert in aid of the Children’s Hospital, to occur'
at the Town Hall on October 18. Mrs. Alex.,
Gordon, Mrs. Ewan Frazer, baritone Andrew;
Black and Staell will be the principal music-j
makers.
Sydney Sun reprinted last Saturday an article
from London Sphere on the amazing cult of
which Leila Waddell, the N.S.W. violinist, is the,
leading lady. Aleister Crowley, a poet, is the:
leading soul or spiritual gardener of the new reli-;
gion, the main idea of which is “to plant Eastern;
Transcendental Buddhism which attains its ulti-
mate end in Samadhi in English soil under the;
guise of Ceremonial Magic.” To the person;
whose hobby is religion, this head of froth should
make a strong appeal. A. Crowley believe 9 that
one can aeroplane to a state of ecstasy by cere-
monial magic, which seems to consist of
dressing in flowing garments, carrying a
drawn sword, listening to selections from
the poets, and watching poets dance, taking
part in occasional processions (not Eight Hour
pageants), burning incense, drinking reverently
from a golden bowl, and listening to violin solos
by an enthroned girl “draped in that curious
blue tint we mentally associate with Hecate.”
The enthroned player is Leila Waddell. The
Crowley religious performance,' with its incense,
strikes one as being the sort of stuffy entertain-
ment from which one comes away with aching
eyes and a nervous headache. Presumably, it was
its evident need of some fresh air that made the
Sun printer tack this brief notice on to the tail of
the descriptive article: “ The picnic fireplace in
the Domain will be available to the public on
Monday, Eight Hour Day. Fuel will be supplied,
and water for billies can be obtained close by.”
London World sends out a colored “ cartoon ”
of George Reid, by Will Dyson. The old gentle-
man looks rather weary, but otherwise is the
“sameold George,” who hasn’t straightened his
legs or got out of the habit of letting his trousers
accumulate in voluminous wrinkles on top of his
boots. Sydney D.T., by the way. becomes almost
enthusiastic over Dyson’s “admirable bit of work.”
Will Dyson did “admirable work” in Australia
for years before he went to London; but in all
that time the D.T. and other patriotic sheets
ignored him and his art utterly. The average
English artist has to be dead to the world before
the London papers accord him praise; local
papers don’t mind passing the local artist a word of
encouragement provided he is dead to Australia.
The sight of three white-bodied, yellow-funnelled
Dutch cruisers squatting in our Harbor, and of
Dutch officers, sailors and Javanese in our streets,
reminded me that I still had some Java items
dried and pressed or stuffed in my notebook and
elsewhere. Some of the officers of these boats were
at Solo, the native capital of Java, whilst we
were there, and this may be a fitting time to put
the last of the Java items in ink and let ’em
freshen up for you.
Solo is the heart of native Java, and the
stronghold of the Sultan or Susuhunan, Pakoe
Boewono (“ Nail of the World”). But with the
black muzzles of Dutch cannon pointing at the
white walls that surround his palace, “strong-
hold” would seem to be a misfit term. We did
not see the Susuhunan, a name which signifies
Milk Dispenser, but we heard of him as a gentle,
courteous man, so the designation fitted him.
A few days previous to our invasion his 38th
child arrived to brighten his early middle-age.
To achieve so much birth-rate he must have a
good allowance of wives ; but his chief consort ia
childless.
“THE NAIL OF THE WORLD."
Over the entrance gate of his private palace the
present “ Nail of the World’s” place in the royal
succession is indicated by the number of nails
driven into a globe. He has an annual income of
£66,000 from the Dutch Government, and his own
revenues bring it up to £200,000 a year; but as
the 17,000 persons inside his lcraton or palace en-
closure are all in his employ, all holding their
jobs directly from him, the gentle milk-dispenser
wants every guilder of the amount. A Dutch ex-
naval officer, with a superbly courteous manner,
who holds some official position at Solo, sponsored
us as eligible to inspect the kraton. At 11 in
the forenoon we, a party of 10, presented our-
selves at the main gate of the kraton, and bent
our spines to the captain of the. guard, a young
man who was, as well, a nephew of the Sultan. He
smiled, showingtheblackened teeth of the Javanese
aristocrat. Just as we were noting that he wore
a black japanned flowerpot on his head, a short
military rather-European coat, green trousers, a
sarong and no boots, two attendants stepped like
panthers to his back, and, with one movement,
removed his jacket, leaving the upper half of him
quite naked. We caught our collective breaths
in a gasp. The removal of his upper clothing left
him in official dress. Wearing his military-
jacket, he would not have dared go through the
kraton, let alone appear in his imperial uncle’s
presence.
The Captain’s way of wearing his sarong was
different from any we had seen. In front it reached
to bis feet, at the back it was folded up in bustle
formation till it looked to be a fat cushion tied
around his waist. Besides taking an hour of his
attendant’s time to adjust, the sarong gave to the
officer’s gait a peculiar straight-front-corset
carriage. Two jewelled krisses completed the
hind view.
With a wave of a beautiful hand, a gesture any
actor might have envied, the royal sapling bade
us follow him. The rest is a confused memory of
huge marble halls where audiences and balls
are given, gardens, statuary, a watch-tower
(which we seemed to be • climbing for hours),
stabjes with 160 horses and quite as many
carriages—from State coaches, made principally
of gold, plate glass and plush, down to dandy
little dogcarts. Umbrellas, leaning against the
marble, signified by their color or stripes the rank
of the callers, who were at the various depart-
ments. Native nobles, officials and village head-
men had arrived by the score to pay taxes. They
sat on their heels at tables about 2ft. high on the
various varandahs. Near dusk, the same evening,
we were in the public gardens a,nd came
on a group of about 15 natives—middle-aged
women, girls and a rabble of small boys.
Straggling rather far behind the group was a
babu (maid), carrying a white umbrella (closed)
with a gold stripe. That signified that one of the
royal family was in the group. Enquiries showed
him to be a boy of about eight, a grandson of the
“Nail,” dressed in a pair of calico combinations.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.
“ Our policy,” says Premier Wade, “is
not a death-bed repentance, but part of the great
forward movement ” :
No death-bed repentance indeed !
’Tis something much worse ;
The movement (how slow is the speed !)
Is that of the hearse.
Blamire Young, whose business instinct
has for once probably gone astray, opens a picture
show in the Melbourne Guild Hall this week.
There was a time, two or three years ago, when
people journeyed to the Guild Hall to buy pictures,
but they haven’t done it lately. Blamire Young
this time is showing “ Scenes from Early Days,
“ Buffalo Mountains,” etc., the coloring and de-
signing whereof are about equally splendid in
their audacity.
Some Australians discovered, last week,
how Britain treats the absentee investor, the
absentee in this case being Australian. Farmer
and Co. run a business in Sydney, but the co. is
registered in London. When the stock was
“listed” on the Sydney Exchange, it was
found that J. Bull charges the Australian in-
vestor income-tax at the rate of Is. 2d. in the £; so
that, instead of getting £6 per cent, on preference
shares, the Australian investor in the Australian
business only gets £5 135., Bull hanging on to the
other 7s. himself. It must be quite right, of
course, because England does it; out if an Aus-
tralian Labor Government did it, the remarks
about spoliation and driving capital out of the
country would be distinctly audible at Oodnadatta.
The Labor Senators are hard at work root-
ing out of the mind of the public the idea that a
boss Labor Senator says something, whereupon
all the other Senators wildly say ditto. One day
last week cliief-Senator McGregor scavenged for
similes to suit his friends. Senator Stewart, he
said, was like “ a fly in a jam tin,” while Senator
Givens was not comparable to a fly, but, ap-
parently, to a somewhat superior animal. In
response, Givens and Stewart contributed gay re-
bukes to the oratorio. Givens observed that
McGregor had brought the argument down to a
very low level, while Stewart termed McGregor
a “ coward ” who was “ only fit for abuse.” After
some more of the same music, the Chairman had
to call loudly for order, and the House lapsed
into listlessness.

RECIPE FOR THE COMPLEXION.
One of onr readers, who writes that she was
formerly severely troubled during the winter and
spring with chapped hands and face, gives us the
following recipe for a simple home-made lotion,
which, she says, is superior to anything else she
has ever tried, and also that it restores the delicate
velvety complexion of youth to those whose skin
has become paralysed and leather-like from the
use of lotions containing arsenic, bismuth and
pearl white.
Procure from your chemist a four-ounce bottle
containing two ounces Rose Water, one drachm
Tincture Benzoin, simp., and two ounces Flowers
of Oxzoin. Mix together and apply night and
morning, with the hands, or use a soft cloth or
sponge. Always shake well before using. If you
desire it perfumed, add a spoonful of French Foil
Fleur Perfume, which is an unusually pleasing
sc;ent, arid combines perfectly with the other ingre-
di biit's. To secure 'perfect results, bathe hands and
face in warm water and dry thoroughly before
applying . *

My Dear Yarrie,—
The V.R.C. October meeting at Flemington, on
Saturday, drew a purely sporting crowd. The
hobbled butterflies who look upon a race
meeting merely as a social outdoor flutter,
have not warmed up yet to the carnival.
Besides, it is their clothes that go to the
races and take them along for padding, and
the clothes are mostly not ready. Wild and
furious armies of dressmakers are just now im-
ploring Heaven to look kindly on their troubles,
for they get no quarter from the Sassiety woman.
So fierce is the annual battle ’twixt wearers and
makers that health frequently suffers. One well-
known member of the Frocked Elect had a ner-
vous breakdowm just at the climax of glory week,
last year; the final prostration happened when
she was hurrying to the meeting after wearing
out her heart and temper in a prolonged battle
with Madame. This year a thoroughly-recuper-
ated lady sits and gloats over six “ dreams,” with
hats to match, all resting quietly in her robe
room. “For Heaven’s sake ” (and, incidentally,
for his peace of mind), “my dear, don’t rush !”
said her husband, at the same time surrender-
ing a fat cheque. So the beautiful goods
are made and ready, and the house is
the happiest in the paddock. On Satur-
day there were a good many smart people,
but they were not the smart people. The
good-sport type of smart woman was there, but
in her second-best tailor-made and under a well-
seasoned hat.
There was great grief among the Robert-
son clan and its friends over the downfall
of Alawa. Mrs. Buchanan (who races as
“Mr. Gordon”) and owns the beautiful fav-
orite, was a Robertson until a couple of years
ago, when she took George Buchanan for better
or worse. Alawa was a hot favorite in the Octo-
ber Stakes (the race that is supposed to have
broken him down), and was well fancied for the
Cup.
A baker’s dozen of most cheerful Dutchmen
came out. Miss Byron Moore and the Forrest
dame had them in hand during the afternoon.
Governor Carmichael, in the unofficial comfort of
a bowler hat and grey sac duds, wandered on
quietly with Secretary Victor Hood. They kept
their glasses on the sport, and mostly ignored the
plush-hung box of State, wherein was a shout of
dark-red roses in a turquoise bowl. That bowl of
roses was the most beautiful sight at Flemington
that grey day. Another circumstance that
cheered the grumpy atmosphere was a woman
with a fair, closely-coiled coiffure snug under a
dandy hat of ermine. She wore trim tailorings,
with more ermine round the neck, and was smart
way up the scale.
The Dutchmen had only just arrived. They
had spent the morning calling officially in motors.
All the week to come is packed with entertain-
ments for Mynheer.
While his Ex. was out at the races, her Ex.
was pleasantly forcing open the Foundling
Hospital Bazaar that has been built up by
months of matinees, bridge parties and the mask
ball. The Town Hall just makes a cosy home for
a bazaar. It is too big and draughty for less bulky
affairs. A bazaar by any other name is just as
expensive ; but as it must be christened some-
thing, this one is called an Alphabetical Fete.
It sounds like a chapter from Alice in Wonder-
land, or the picture-letter book on which the
young of the human species begin their mental
feeding. Each State has a letter, and
sells only things that begin with that letter. C
doesn’t sell seasheljs. S does that. When a
charity lover gets into the hall and wants to buy
(the species really does exist!), he stands still and
says “A is for apples, artlessness and aero-
planes; B for bananas, bores and balloons,” and
makes straight for his goal. Sometimes, that is.
For one can make mistakes. You want food.
F, of course. But it isn’t—it’s R for refresh-
ments. The attendants who wait on you wear
spick and span white dresses, black satin caps and
a pink rose over one ear. No one could resist
these sirens, even though they charged like the
Light Brigade.
At the opening, Florrie Green’s most charming
small-girl dancers pirouetted through extracts of
various comic operas, and floated through dances
composed by the clever Florrie herself. The
Carmichael lady was so delighted with this child-
show of ballet work that she toted the youngsters
round the bazaar and bought them boxes of choco-
lates at fabulous prices. In the evening, Mrs. Green
and daughter Florrie had acafe chantant arranged,
and there was more dancing—this time by grown-
up pretties. Eight of thecomeliest figures of the
Elect swathed themselves in the white of “ San-
dow gels.” Aileen M’Evoy danced the Merry
Wid. with Peter Schuler, son of Editor Schuler,
of the Age. This youth also helped Olive Ather-
ton with the Swing Song from “Veronique.”
The lady had a swing made specially for the occa-
sion, and it will go to help the gaiety of the
foundlings after the show. Marie Hall, of Ben-
digo Watson’s wealthy clan, danced the Dive
with the Jackson youth, and Winnie Tait fluttered
through a Spring Song dance.
There was a tragic ending to the first night of
the Fete. Some rascally thief stole the beans —I
mean the takings. The bag containing the
money—something like £so—was put on a table
for a moment. Manager Brentnall turned his
back —and the mean trick was done.
A report on the Talbot Milk Institute, supplied
to the Government by a medical man and a
Treasury accountant, has drawn a flatly contra-
dictory statement from a rival medical man who
professes to speak from personal experience. The
Institute is a vice-regal legacy. Governor Tal-
bot’s wife concerned herself about the excessive
mortality among the infantsof the poorest people,
due, in a large measure, to improper feeding, and
when she started an agency for the distribution of
pure milk, her social influence secured for it a
Government grant. The Institute has, it seems,
been conducted on strictly unbusinesslike lines.
The condemnatory report says :
No record was kept of the number of children supplied,
nor any particulars concerning them, so that it was im-
possible to prepare mortality or other statistics, or arrive
at the expenditure per head. ... A cash book of an
elementary character appeared to have been written up
nearly in globo, instead of being kept up-to-date and
regularly balanced. . . . No receipts were given. . . . We
consider that the Institute is an example of how this
community has charitable institutions foisted upon it to
do what can be more easily and effectively done bv existing
bodies.
All of which is beside the question of excessive
infant mortality in relation to milk supply. If
Lady Talbot’s scheme was essentially good, the
fact that the books of the Institute have been
muddled is no reason why the Government should
drop it. A couple of smart clerks could soon put
things right and keep them right. Bad book-
keeping can’t infect good milk, nor does it make
any odds to a thriving infant that its daily pint or
quart of nourishment is not entered in a ledger.
Dolores has had a week of triumph. This
musical city has been banqueted on melody for
months past, and it was hard to imagine where
good-house enthusiasm could come from even for
a favorite. But Dolores has had her good houses—
good, contented, satisfied houses—that have sat
back and drained the champagne cup of song every
time. She is a satisfying person is Dolores,
with her perfection of voice and her surprises
in songs. No orchid-hunter ever sought
so strenuously or with so much whole-hearted
enthusiasm for “new” species. An orchid-
hunter’s “ new ’’find is usually something hun-
dreds of years old—but new to him and the
present world. ' iSo Dolores’s new songs are very
old ones—mostly the sweet and simple airs of far-
back centuries, with the quaint flavor and
atmosphere that must belong to the days when
the world went leisurely on its round. She
uses a unique genius in interpreting that
atmosphere, and the result is invariably ex-
quisite. With all this, there is a quiet,
smileful, charming personality', and a voice that
is never troubled by efforts to climb. Wherever
the note is—the unusual note—Dolores reaches
for it as easily as if it were a star and she a
witch on a broom. She has made Australian
audiences hers by sheer force of conquest. On
Friday—when she gave her last concert —she
rounded up the insisted-upon encore, at the finale,
by singing the Laughing Song. At the end of
the last verse, with Dolores’s laugh echoing through
the hall, the enthusiastic Liedertafel men (who
were grouped in the south balcony) suddenly
joined in with Hoch ! Hoch ! Hoch !
The Scandinavians held a music and dance
meeting at the Turn Yerein Hall the other Mon-
day night—their Norden Annual Festival. Mrs.
Christesen, who has an artistic personality and a
notable soprano voice, was the moving spirit,
Mrs. Janson and others assisting in the vocal
department, whilst the blonde Una Bourne soloed
at the piano. A tableau, representing “The
Bridal Party’s Return from Hardanger,” was
staged by Mr, Wendtland; and, finally, the
Norden volk danced till 2 a.rn. There are not
many Scandinavians in Melbourne, but when
they spread themselves for a shivoo their little
community makes a lot of gladness, anyhow.
Scandinavians and Germans are thoroughly
domestic in their pleasures. To the Scandinavian
carnival the mother brought baby, so that
she could stay, happily confident of the child’s
welfare, through the whole gorgeous evening.
There were crowds of babies, each shining and
clean, with blue bows for shoulder knots. A
concert programme ran away with the early part
of the evening, and a ball with the late part.
The babies—those who could toddle—wandered
about during musical items, demanding atten-
tion—and getting it. A surprising number
of stolid, young men with round, blue eyes
and very pink cheeks seemed willing to
pick up any toddling infant and dandle
it to the tinkle of the piano. Una Bourne, who
is an Australian out of Scandinavia, played
often and beautifully ; but even she was
submerged in the intense excitement caused
by the tableau" that was to follow. After
the concert, chaperoning mothers drifted
off stolidly with the sleepy younger fry ; then the
wilder whirl of frivol began. But the Scandi-
navian national square dances are precise, as well
as picturesque. Among them, there is a dot-and-
carry-one dance, like a polka or a Judkins type
of two-step.
Essie Perrin floated through her last Australian
dance (for the present, at any rate) at “Sergeant
Brue” last Friday night, just when the hilarious
policemen were clearing the stage for old-fashioned
“Tom Jones.” The tall, fair-haired girl de-
parted by the Osterley on Tuesday ; she was fare-
welled to the tune of six luncheons, five dinners
and 20 suppers a day ; so she can have no doubt
about Australian hospitality. She and Miss
Denton—the mummer-daughter of George Sin-
Gin Denton —stayed all their Melbourne time
with Mrs. Oldham, sister of the lawyer-brother
of the Kruse boys, who were the dainty Perrin’s
most devoted attaches during this last Melbourne
season.
Gertrude Alger, the beautiful Australian girl
who has just brought her violin home from foreign
parts, gave a “welcome-home” concert in the
Town Hall last week. Her father first taught her
how to draw music from the strings; then the
great Kruse took her in hand. After her Aus-
tralian home-rest, Miss Alger has an engagement
to play in Richter’s orchestra. An ardent fiance
—attached during the homeward voyage just con-
cluded—is trying hard to persuade her to cancel
that engagement and take one for life with him.
Lieutenant Warren, R.N., is the lucky man. He
is so enamored of Bananaland that he intends to
give up the navy and go and plant cocoanuts or cane
or something in that tropical country. He wants
the pretty violinist to go along and watch, and
there is talk of a wedding at Christmas. Quite
lately, she sprained her hand and a tendon in her
arm through overwork (nine hours’ practice a day,
added to numerous engagements, is too much for
any pretty arm). So the sailor thinks she cannot
too soon give the hand into his keeping for good.
Miss O’Connor, the lead in “Tom Jones,” is
Mrs. Cory in private life. Her husband is travel-
ling with her. They possess a four-months’-old
baby-boy, who, in the joyous hours of playtime, is
solemnly addressed as “Mr. Spifkins.” So, one
way and another, the little family of three is rich
in names.
Cliveden, the Clarke white-elephant house
at East Melbourne, is about to enter public life.
This week, as a beginning, the Arts and Crafts
folks are inviting People and the Governor to
an exhibition there. I am going to take some
provisions and a compass in my pocket, as I
understand there are 350 t) square miles of trackless
floor-space in the old baronial pile.
The “ Cigale ” amateur-tableaux lady got back
heavily on Mrs. Grundy and her numerous
female relations at the encore performance in the
St. Kilda Town HaU, The whole programme
was carefully repeated, and the dainty little
Cigale was shown wrapped up warmly enough tor
motoring, with a gleam of righteous defiance in
her eyes. It must have been the lighting that
alarmed the honorary censors at the first show.
One of our wealthiest and woolliest widowers
seems to be taking notice again. The fortunate
lady is located somewhere over the footlights ot
one of the current shows. No cosy party of
chaperone, odd man and pretty girl accompanies
the rich devotee to the front stalls; he sits alone
throughout the show, while neighboring stallites
gaze, and try to guess which girl is the object of
his rapt attention.
Julius is still the Beloved Knight. He skims
round town in the motors of the Financially
Blest, and scarcely ever has to touch the common
ground vi'ith his Loot-soles. One or two of his
favorite characters are to be given a last run at a
hotch-potch matinee, at which Beatrice Day will
play Lady Mary to his Beaucaire.
Mrs. D’Ebro, the dowager-queen of the Women’s
Hospital committee, has gone to Sydney for a
holiday. The new lion, sec., Mrs. Earle, is tack-
ling the capacious work with rather a trembling
heart. Mrs. D Ebro had so little fear of hard
work that it takes a brave woman to follow in her
footsteps.
Maud Grantham, the fine and handsome recit-
ress of Dickeris, will shortly try her talent in a
new stvle of Story and Song entertainment. She
is to tell the “ Just So’’ tales of Kipling, which
were written for children but are not beyond the
comprehension-of grown-ups. Each story has its
song, set to music by Edward German, and a crude
illustration by author Kipling. Miss Grantham
will sing the songs, and make brush drawings of
the original pictures about eight times bigger than
they appear in the book. Eor these works of art
the entertainer will allow herself six minutes each.
If she paints half as effectively as she sings, the
making of the pictures will be an interesting
feature of the three-sided entertainment. There
are six Just So stories. The impressive lady pro-
poses to tell three in an evening, and the first
evening will be Friday, October 21, at the Inde-
pendent Hall, Collins-street. By the way, the
little hall at the back of “Dr. Be van’s ” church
is becoming quite a usual place of “drawing-
room ” entertainment. And why isn’t Melbourne
provided witha pretty band-box theatre, where
the one-man or one-girl show would have a
circular setting and the right atmosphere ?
A story is tbld at West’s Pictures of the wild
recklessness with which Sandy, from the Soil,
squanders his Saxpences when he comes to toon
for the Show. Two braw, red-whiskered farmers
and a small boy stood in the vestibule, and one of
thetnen—the pay master—was reading thepricelist
aloud. “Two shillin’s, eighteenpence, stalls a
shillin’, children sixpence,” he said. Then he
looked thoughtfully at the small boy and re-
peated, “Children sixpence!” But the holiday
spirit was in his blood. “ Dang it, we’ll make a
man of him for once ! ” said the spendthrift, and
turning to the ticket box, he demanded ; “Three
stalls for three shillin’s ! ” in the tone of a man
who never does things by halves.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide :
Admiral Henderson, our visiting naval adviser, was
shown round by the local Excellencies while he was in
Adelaide, On Sunday they took him to Victor Harbor.
Next day he, Lady Henderson and attendant satellites
were packed into a train full of flowery compliments, and
booked through to Melbourne. Our permanent Admiral
meanwhile was being wafted away to look the Brown
Hill country in the eye. We have so many bazaars and
other vital matters for our Excellency to push open or
seal up during the next few months that we have had to
raise his salary. It is not much, only five or six hundred
pounds, by way of a little extra pin money, and because
he was led to believe before he accepted the billet that
we paid his private sec. and other helps, whereas that joy
really belongs to himself.
An early heat-wave caught the Hunt Club races with
painful results. Dust, masonry, bricks, and other goods
were concealed in the new Sorry Widow millinery by the
end of the day, and I know one woman who is building
a new stable with the quarry she found on her
hat. However, there was no serious loss of life. The
new fashions came out in bulk and rioted about the
lawns, including the mill-wheel hat and the skirt a foot
in diameter. Incidentally there were some horse races.
Units in the army of the well-frocked were Mrs. Arthur
Bymill, blue-clad, with chiffon and rose millinery; a
Bowman lady, in an embroidered dream of black and
blue ; a white charmeuse Stirling girl, a brown-clad Miss
Murray, and Mrs. H, Bray in a heavenly white lace gar-
ment.
Three men who rode for the first Hunt Club Cup, 41
years ago, reminisced among the crowd on the lawns —
Ebenezer Ward, S. Terry and W. P. Auld. The youngest
Ward, a son of “ Ebby,” was riding in sundry events on
this occasion.
Elsie Jones, whose nice soprano warble has been lifted
to the rafters all too seldom since her return from the
British speck a year or so ago, ga\‘e a song matinee in
the Town ..Hall 'banqueting- room on Friday afternoon.
There wasSal,goodly classic programme and a goodly
classic audience, which looked as though it might really
know the works of Mr. Brahms and Mr. Pergolesi. The
singer, clad in apricot silk and black plumed mil-
linery, used to be reckoned Minna Fischer’s cham-
pion' exponent of German lieder, and her work
in. this direction was certainly somewhat scintillating. A
songlet by Wolf, rejoicing in the pretty name of
“ Verborgenheit,” was the most joysome number of the
afternoon. The soprano girl deserves 47 laurel wreaths
for her excellent enunciation.
Mr. and Mrs. E. S. Emerson slipped through Adelaide
in a dust-storm, on Friday, on their way to brighten the
Inkv track of Westralia.
At the identical moment this letter was plunging on
board the Melbourne express the Bishop Thomas twain
were entertaining the world and his wife—particularly
his w ife—at a garden party. Bishop’s Court is an aged
residence, with large and lofty rooms and a quiet exterior
that is a beautiful contrast to the upstart, red-faced
dwellings looming round it. The garden is shadeful and
rose-grow-n, and at all times a joyful spot in a hollow'
world. Ergo, that garden party needs no further refer-
-6llJean Martin, the Adelaide girl who joined the Julius
Superhumanus company, and later went on the British
stage to seek her fortune, has achieved success. Mac-
graith is his name, and he is a mining engineer of British
Columbia. The damsel is the younger daughter of the
one-time machine-making Martins, of Gawler, you re-
member. . .
The Commercial Travellers are combining wits and
other rare possessions for their annual charity frivol.
This takes the form of a fancy dress scrimmage, known
by courtesy as a football match. This is one of the local
events which you go to or die, therefore various good
charities, benefit by it yearly to a comfortable extent.
The affair is destined to break the peace on October 22.
Australia has called effectively again. Colonel Madl
who formerly told the South Aus. police force the way i
should shoot, went to his native British Islands ori ni»
retirement. He has been living with relatives in W »
but finds the Islands so grey and gruesome that he nas
decided to come back to the ’roo country and its sunn,, ns.
There are loud rejoicings generally that Professor
Lowrie has been recaptured to guide our agriculture.
He is to be its director, and, under the Minister, will nave
full control of every ear of wheat and inch of barley t
lifts its head above this soil. Once he was chief of Bose-
worthy Agricultural College, and was much liked tnere
and at most other places. He married a South Aus-
tralian, too —one of the Longbottom family.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

Why not Start Photography
with a Brownie Camera?
THERE are no establishments better equipped than ours for the supplying: of cameras and

pensive instrument, but really such is not the case. Just to prove to you
how small an outlay is necessary to secure one, we direct your attention to
the following offer :
The Edison “ Gem ** Combination Phonograph is a favorite model, and it
plays both Two- and Four-minute Records. You can purchase one complete,

REGULARITY OF THE BOWELS.
The First Line of Defence Against
111-Health.
Constipation is the root of nine-tenths of the
sickness of man, and a large proportion of the
sickness of women. It’s a simple thing of itself,
but, like many simple things, it may grow and
become complicated.
When the bowels are clogged the waste matter
decays and ferments and enters the blood, and is
carried to all parts of the body, producing head-
aches, biliousness, sleeplessness, heartburn, loss of
ill
appetite, indi-
gestion, neural-
gia, rheumatism
and various
other ailments
disturbing the
heart and ner-
vous system ;
and if continued
is liable to cause
inflammation of
the bowels,
liver and
kidneys.
To main-
tain a heal-
thy system
the bowels
should oper-
ate at least
once every
24 hours.
,This is one
of Nature's
wise provi-
s;ons which is too often ignored, and the result is
untold suffering. Women and children are the
greatest offenders, but why such should be the
case is a problem to be solved.
Nature often requires a little assistance, and if
this assistance is given at the first indication much
distress and suffering may be averted. Mothers,
especially, should guard the health of their
children, and inculcate regular habits from infancy.
As a family remedy for costiveness, Dr, Morse’s
Indian Root Pills have a wide reputation. They
are mild in their action; causing neither weakness
nor sickness, and do not gripe.
To overcome constipation take from one- to four
pills regularly until the bowels move daily, and
are restored to healthy action,*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Never a Derby day broke finer in Sydney than
on Saturday last., and never a Derby crowd broke bigger
|nd gayer through the turnstiles at Randwick to sparkle
on the lawns, and splash on the betting square, and foam
against the adamant shores and shears of Judea.
It was a great flood of humanity, swirling
in the sunshine of blue-and-satined hours and gold-
lined purses, amid the hoarse cries of Bar Von
and the laughter of beautifully-dressed women. De-
lightful creatures these last, who mostly wore over
their heads bell tents, painted in all the hues of a
sulphur rainbow above Gehenna, and adorned with
the tail of the Bird of Paradise, or 3' . bunch
of blossoms from the Tree of Knowledge. Also,
many of the beautiful (and other) women wore the
Judkins costume. None of them had straws in their hair
—probably because the attendants thought the brand was
already plain enough. Altogether it is estimated that
there were present over 30,000 lunatics, Governors,
punters, thieves, spielers, members of Parliament,
jockeys’ league of Sandow imitators, policemen who never
yet arrested a horse-owner even under the provocation of
daylight robbery, leaders of society, peris of the private
bar and public ballet, and other supporters of the sport
of kings and the spoil of bookmakers.
Two or three records were broken on the day.
It was the largest attendance for a Derby, the largest
field for the race, and about the coldest reception for the
winner. Of the 14 colts and fillies that went to the tape
for the big race, the public had figured that Cadoiiia was
as near a winner as form could indicate. He went out at
five to two a strong favorite, with Beverage next in esti-
mation at seven to twm. Very few backers worried about
Tanami until after the race, when they joyfully met Holy
Hoses and collected at the rate of 25 to one. No doubt
the fact that Tanami had on the previous Satur-
day been donkey-licked in the Hawkesbury Guineas
influenced his long price for the Derby. But at
Hawkesbury he is said to halve been ill. Perhaps he
was, or he may have been badly ridden ; or, perchance,
he was stubborn. Anyhow, he was none of these things
last Saturdaj'. He looked well ; he moved well ; he ivas
well; he was cleverly ridden ; and he galloped as if he
had backed himself for a pot. He was navigated into a
good position early in the race, and was well in hand
when Oadonia was a gone coon.
At the three-furlong post Tanami was sent
along to argue the point with Indiscreet and Prince Lack,
who were pounding it out in front. Rounding-the turn
Tanami took the lead and sailed for home down the
straight at a fearful bat. He waschallenged successively
by Beverage, Moorilla and Bobadea ; but none of them
could live with his pace, and he passed the judge with a
couple of lengths to spare from Bobadea, and two and a
half from Beverage. It was a cold, dead-frog sort of
greeting he received when he returned from his labors,
and the chances are that, had the public not been feeling
good at having backed The Reckoning and Patronat us,
who went out favorites for the Hurdle Race and the Trial
Stakes, there would have been some loud grumbling—
although so little faith had Tanami’s trainer that he said
he wouldn’t wager a clay pipe on his chance. Which
would seem to show that the animal did not exhibit much
improvement during the week following the Hawkesbury
meeting, but suddenly took it in his head to be cantan-
kerous to spite the stable.
The Epsom was responsible for a great finish
between Silver Hampton and Flavinius. Twenty-three
prads started in the race ; Malt King and Flavinius being
strong favorites with the eternal hard-luck punter, who
hacks on form or the tip of a stranger, with the faith of
the mentally-afflicted. Golden Slipper, Bobby and Gold
Lace were also well backed, and Silver Hampton shortened
to 12 to one against u'hen it was known that W. PI. Smith
was to pilot him. From the six-furlongs pole Broadsword
led the string, and at the half-mile he was two lengths
in advance of a handy bunch, which included Flavinius.
Round the bend they came, until at the distance Ra did
a great rush simultaneously with Silver Hampton and
Flavinius. With 50yds. to go, the two last-named fought
it out desperately, Silver Hampton winning by about a
neck. Golden Siipper also finished.
The Spring Stakes was the great race of the
day, and a thing of beauty to the children of Jericho.
Nothing, said the übiquitous public, could beat Prince
Foote, and two to one on was the price Mo received. The
next horses on the list were Parsee at eight to one, and
Trafalgar and Comedy King at 12 to one against. The
pace was fast from the start, Britain wheeling the party
round past the mile post, and dropping them at the back
stretch, where Son of the Marsh led by three lengths
from Trafalgar, Comedy King, Parsee and Prince Foote.
They held their positions so until sweeping into the
straight. At the distance Comedy King broke away
beautifully, with Prince Foote in company. Past
the stands the3' thundered, the black horse galloping
like a machine and the favorite dancing to the tune,
with whip and spur to mark the time, and the yells of
thousands as a chorus. The crowd seemed to go fanti
for Prince Foote. It cheered him as a winner when a blind
man could have seen he was beaten—done like a fried egg
in the distance. Nevertheless, he was driven on in wild
but fruitless pursuit of the fast-finishing Comedy King till
the last ounce was out of him, and he galloped dead.
With all the disappointment of the crowd, the winner
was given a generous reception at the paddock. It would
have been a poor sport who could have seen the splendid
run, and the machine-like action of that lithe animal
without feeling his soul dance within him.
A miserable field of four materialised for the
First Steeplechase. One competitor ran out at the back
of the course ; the favorite, Bullworth, about which the
books went so far as to wager even money, was never in
it, and so Nigel and Seymour jumped it out on their
own. Ultimately Nigel won pulling up. Steeplechas-
ing in N.S.W. lingers so painfully in the neigh-
borhood of Death that it would be a kindly
and rational act if the A.J.C. authorities passed it out
definitely. On Monday 300 and odd good sovereigns
were squandered on an exhibition which was of little
more sporting interest than the £5 hunters’contest at a
country show.
Mr. William Fletcher, the owner of the winners
of the Epsom and Metrop., packed up a tidy financial
parcel one way and another. He backed his two cracks
i,o win the double event; also he backed them with
confidence to win separately. And when he and
the stable had done helping themselves, twenties
were still obtainable about Saturday’s winner and
fifteens about the Metrop. hero. In addition, there was
a useful .mass of stake-money to be collected. Mr.
Fletcher is a squatter up north. After his recent amaz-
ing successes, tie need never tbil again unless he wants
to, and he may even regard Fisher’s land-tax with indiff-
erence, not to say contempt.
In a mighty cloud of dust and a howling,
scorching -'westerly, the immense Metrop. field got away
to a great start. The holiday-makers, dividing their
money between Patronatus and Flavinius, enjoyed
the somewhat arid pleasure of “ a run for
their money "; the Victorians stood by shapely little
Pendil, but got no encouragement at any stage of
the agony. Everything turned out as the Fletcher stable
had intended it should. Eric ate dust for the first
half-mile, while Maltjne and Ra fled ahead, discharging
soil, turf, rubble and sundries at the field. About
here Patronatus took up the running, amid hoivls
of hopeful joy from the inhabitants of the flat.
Then Silver Hampton, the stable companion of the pre-
destined winner, in fulfilment of his appointed task,
tackled the front-rankers ; whereat, with the paralysing
swiftness of a John Hop leaping through the breach in a
Mongolian fan-tan establishment, Eric slid from the
ruck. All was over bar the moaning of the vast horde
of the uninitiated, who had hardly realised that the Sir
William-Heather gelding was alive. And the verdict was
a neck, a similar space separating Ra, the second, from
Flavinius.
The writer heard a prominent racing owner pay a sin-
cere tribute to the tote. He was anathematising the
subtle and unscrupulous ways of turf hirelings. Said he :
“ Under existing conditions one never knows which of
the blighted boys is stiff and which isn’t. The day the
Government gets sense and wipes out the bookmakers I
shall double my string and feel sure of doing a
bit of good for myself." It doesn’t jump with the
arguments of those who contend that, lacking O’Cohen,
the pore, big- owner wouldn’t be able to get his bit on,
and would consequently have to go out of the racing
game, to the great detriment of the turf and the ruin of
countless hard-working horsemen, trainers, racing touts
and so forth.
The V.R.C. October meeting, last Saturday, re-
vealed nothing of special interest except the breakdown
of the mighty Alawa. Previous to this calamity the word
was going round that the big horse could hardly be made
fit for a Melbourne Cup struggle. With Alawa out of it
and Prince Foote appearing to be less wonderful than his
fond owner imagined him, the Cup pretensions of
Blairgour loom larger than they loomed a week
ago. Next Saturday is the first of the Caulfield
meeting, and Blairgour, it is understood, will run in the
Guineas. A man in the street alleges that Wakeful’s
somewhat mysterious son will win the Guineas, prior to
“ shaking ” some richer stakes. Wherefore the attention
of this scribe is just now divided between Blairgour—the
handsomest of this season’s three-vear-olds—and Olivas-
ter, in Seobie’s stable. But the Sydney horses will be
coining to Melbourne early next week to have a say in
the Caulfield Cup.
The idea that Alaw’a “broke down ’’ in the
October Stakes race last. Saturday was not supported by
veterinary evidence. To the public in the grand stand
it seemed certain that Alawa was dotty on one of his
forelegs after the race. The horse “ pecked ” once or
twice whilst walking, as though he were likely to stumble
and fall. Trainer Scobie’s explanation of Alawa’s defeat
is that “in the early part of the race he hit his near
fore pastern joint, the seat of his old trouble,
and thereafter refused to try." But, as regards his
chance for the Melbourne Cup, everybody who saw
Alawa’s deportment after the race last Saturday will
continue to think that what happened to him then will
hanpeu to him again the first time he is asked to go at top
speed. Prince Foote may not be good enough to win the
Melbourne Cup this year, but he should be worth backing
at 5 to 1 on to beat the burly animal that ran second to
him last year.

Maoriland Government has decided to wipe
Christian Moses right off the face of the Ricketty Isles.
The Bill for the purpose will have been circulated by the
time this is in print, and will provide that all people
caught acting as bookmakers shall be liable to a fine of
£lOO or three months’ imprisonment for each offence.
People who bet with bookmakers will be liable to fines
not exceeding £5O for each offence. The police
will be given power to arrest upon suspicion
and without warrant ; and altogether the Act, if
it passes as drafted, will be one of the most drastic ever
let loose in Maoriland. At the same time the tote is to
be pruned somewhat, and the 128 tote-permits now
issued annually will be reduced to 100. The 242 days
per annum on which racing is allowed will be cut down
to 190, and the distribution of the tote-permits will be
taken out of the hands of the clubs and vested in a com-
mittee of five appointed directly by the Government.

Honor to the dead Chavez ! Exactly why this
Peruvian has been picked out for special recognition is
not hard to understand, for though among the little band
of air-men it is hard to choose one and set him up as the
bravest of the brave, the world has gone fanti over this
man’s fearsome ride. Other men had soared as high, and
some higher; but they had chosen empty space, over
plain country, whereas Chavez and three others put their
aeroplanes at the vast fence of the Alps and tried to jump
from Switzerland into Italy. Chavez was one of the four
who left Brigue in Switzerland one stormy day to soar
through the Simplon Pass. When they went friends held a
service for the dead, firmly believing that the men had gone
for good. But they came back, having realised the hope-
lessness of plunging through the storm that was tearing
itself to pieces among the Alpine tops. On the following
Thursday Chavez made a second attempt, alone, and
reached the entrance of the pass in safety. Here he
found himself caught like a ship in a narrow strait. An
air-torrent was roaring through the pass, and swept him
along at a fearful speed. It took him all he knew to
avoid being dashed to pieces against the rocky walls
of the ravine. His head grew dizzy with the
speed; the aeroplane plunged and rocked like a
ship amidst a hundred whirlpools. Then struggling
gusts caught his machine and tossed it, and others came
in crosswise and whirled it, till Chavez wondered that he
kept afloat. Then, after an uncanny, eerie experience,
which seemed to last weeks and weeks, suddenly he
soared out into the sunlight, and saw, nearly 8000 ft.
below, the sunlit plains of Italy. After that fearful
ride he felt, no doubt, that he had escaped from the jaws
of death. But just when the shadow of destruction
seemed to have been left behind, he dashed into an anti-
cyclone, or something, in the shape of a funnel of air with
an empty space in the middle of it, and either fell through
or was whirled to the ground. The machine was tossed
right over, and Chavez was caught between the ground
and his motor. The wonder is he was not killed out-
right. As it was, he broke both legs and was injured
internally, buthe recovered consciousness, andlived to tell
his tale, and then passed out in delirium, raving of more
glaciers, peaks and the general horror. He was riding
through the Simplon Pass a second time when he died.
* * * *
Till Sunday the monoplane had held the palm
for soaring, and all the records had been made on the
bird-like machine. But then the biplane suddenly
irrupted in a remarkable fashion. M. Wynmalen, on a
biplane, started from Mourmelon, in France, and flew no
less than 9174 ft. into space. There his supply of petrol
gave out, and he started back .for Mourmelon in great
sweeping circles. In 13 minutes he arrived safe and
sound. This is the world’s record at time of writing. By
time of printing it will probably have been broken.
* * * *
Although there is plenty of room in the atmo-
sphere, collisions have started to occur among the air-
men, and at Milan, in Italy, there has been a notable
smash. A Frenchman named Thomas got loose on an
Antoinette monoplane and ran a fearsome rig. Shoot-
ing downwards he just skimmed over one startled
Italian who was about 150 ft. high, and 50ft. below he
crashed into the biplane of Captain Dickson. The two
machines remained locked together, the cylinders of
both motors exploded, and the whole mass came crash-
ing down 100 ft. to the earth. Thomas, like the man who
fell over the dress-circle of the theatre, escaped with only
a few braises, but the other man came off very badly,
receiving internal injuries from which he will probably
recoyer only when he soars to the gates of the realms of
the blessed.
* * * *
Monday (Eight Hour Day) was wildly windy
and filthy in Sydney. Balmain, Sydney’s tattered suburb,
tried to hold its annual regatta, and managed to carry
the thing through in a sort of a way. But the gusty wind
played ducks and drakes with the rowing skiffs, and the
races usually went to the boat that managed to keep
afloat. Most of the competing craft were swamped, and
there was more swimming than rowing. The sailing races
were better, of course ; but the sudden gusty shocks
were too much for many of. the competitors, and they
went over and under. Still Balmain was happy, as its
local club won five out of the six rowing events, and
scored 36 points in the pennant competition. Therefore
the stranger in Balmain who ventures to remark that
Monday was a cow of a day is met with an amazed ex-
pression, and treated with the tender diffidence accorded
to the mentally afflicted.

The opening of Sydney Stadium for the summer
was a sight to gladden the heart of Manager Coveil. The
Mclntosh himself is at present in England, “looking for
a white champion to smash Brudder Johnsing.” No less
than 10,000 people were round the vast enclosure, watch-
ing Johnny Summers and Hughie Mehegan, of Victoria,
wage war under the supervision of “Showy” Baker.
Summers was said to weigh lOst. lib. ; Mehegan, 9st. 71b.
Summers was a favorite at 3 to 1 “ on,” and the way he
stood up with a statuesque pose seemed to please the
audience. Mehegan, on the other hand, affected the
crouch. The battle was not spectacular, being quite
devoid of frills. It was a solid slogging match from be-
ginning to end, and had they got home half their blows
the scrap would have finished early in the evening. But
they didn’t; so they slogged and socked away till the
full 20 rounds had run out, when “Snowy” said it
was a draw. Most of the audience that lifted
up its voice seemed to violently disagree with
Mr. Baker; and Summers was declared to have
been robbed. But then Summers, according to the
popular idea, is always getting robbed. What really
counts is the fact that Summers is a defensive fighter.
It is a rare thing for him to go out looking for the other
fellow, and he is usually called on in his own corner ; and
the referees will persist in making large allowances for
the fact that the other fellow does the attacking. If
Summers showed more inclination to return the visit, he
would be more popular with referees.
This year’s Warrnambool to Melbourne cycle
road race was plain, untrimmed Sheol. At Warrnambool
355 starters faced the pistol in drizzling rain with a nasty
wind blowing right in their teeth. Sixty miles of slush,
rain and head wind sufficed to weed out the weaklings
and fair-weather champions, who crumpled up like wet
blotting-paper and made for the nearest bar and railway
station with alacrity. The others struggled on, looking
anxiously for Geelong, where it was reckoned that the
turnin the road would change the hostile wind toa friendly
one. But hardly had the first man arrived at Geelong
than the wind chopped round so as to carefully meet him
again in the teeth, while it blew harder than ever. The
honors went to Victoria and Westralia, neither the Ma
State nor Maoriland having a look in at all. Gascoyne,
the favorite, was never heard of, ar.d the mighty Tom
Larcombe, the hope and pride of N.S.W., ran in 67th. G.
Piercey (Vic.) was first, with J. McSweeney (W.A.) right
on his wheel, second. Then came Perrett, J. O’Brien
and E. Smith, nil of Vic. The fastest time was made by
J. Pianta (Westralia), who ran through in 9hr. 30min.
46sec. Piercey’B time was lOhr. lmin. 21sec.
Practically all the first men to arrive were,
except McSweeney, long starters. Piercey, the winner,
was on 47 minutes, McSweeney had only 17, Perrett had
45, O’Brien 47, and E. Smith 49. Munro, last year’s
winner, was6oth, and took lOhr. Bmin. 28sec., as against

Dunlops. ■
Francis Birtles, the overlanding cyclist, bobbed
up again at Peak Hill (W.A.), whither he had been taken
by a party of drovers who had found him in the bush
with but little water and no food. About the only thing
that came through the ride unscathed was the specially-
built Anthony Hordern bike. That good Australian
machine, shod with good Dunlop tyres, was still un-
damaged.

The first round of Sydney first-grade cricket
came off on Saturday and Monday, and proved mildly
interesting. Some handsome scores were made ; and, in
spite of the general rawness, there were flashes of indivi-
dual quality that made the round sparkle in spots. On
Saturday* University scored 306 against North Sydney,
chiefly by the aid of'R. B. Minnett, who whacked up 108
off his own bat before Proctor bowled him. North Sydney
replied on Monday, when Norman Deane eclipsed Minnett
with 145. But Deane was not so well supported as Min-
net was, and the innings ended with 276, or 30 in favor of
University. Sydney Cricket Ground was occupied by
Petersham and Burwood, who played to music. But the
martial strains did not rouse Burwood to baresark deeds,
and Petersham’s 254 rose like a dead wall. Petersham
piled up its figures by all-round solid play, the highest
score being Harvey’s 42. Burwood in its first effort
smacked up 137, arid followed on for 129 for eight
wickets. So Petersham won on the first innings by
117. The match between Balmain and Waverley
was a close thing. Waverley banged up 236
on Saturday, and Balmain on Monday , replied
with 225 ; result, a win for Waverley with 11 to spare.
Redfern downed Sydney at Rushcutter’s Bay by 34 on
the first innings (235 to 201); Glebe smashed up Middle
Harbor at Manly (359 to 179, an awful doing of 179 runs
onlthe first innings); and Gordon, where Premier Wade
comes from, managed to down Central Cumberland by
62 on the first innings (285 to 223). The century-
makers were Makin (Redfern), 125; and R. B.
Minnett (University), 108. On Monday, three cen-
turies were recorded, including Norman Deane's
145 made for North Sydney, C. M’Carthy’s 120 for
Glebe, and Trumper’s 105 for Gordon. The first day the
bowlers did badly, but on the Monday, assisted by the
beastly wind, they Bad rather a good time. Scott, of
Petersham, took eight Burwood wickets for 46; and
O’Neill, of Central Cumberland, six Gordon wickets for
42. The rest ran to double figures. Altogether it was a
batsman’s bout.
Saturday saw the close of Vic. League foot-
ball, though the Ass. has still its “ grand final” to play
off. Spectators were fewer than two years ago; still
they made a respectable array—43,ooo to wit—and passed
£1420 into the League’s coffers, making £sl3Bfor the four
deciding games on the Metropolitan Cricket Ground. In
the nature of things an exciting contest could not be ex-
pected on Saturday, Carlton having lost several good
’bailers and being generally at sixes and sevens, while
’Wood played the same reliable 18 that had won its last
four games; with but two changes the same team
had won 10 matches right off the reel. The Magpies
started with a will, got their system going, and
repeated the performance that broke South up the pre-
vious week —a series of determined dashes that gave
them a 20-point lead and left them nothing to do but
hold their own. The Old Blues played their best—most
of them—but always they were up against a stronger
combination. No individual brilliance can compete against
that sort of thing. At times, they showed flashes ; once
they got within 12 points of the Magpips ; but almost
immediately another goal put them back again. Yet
they died hard. A “willing” bump in the last quarter
was met by a hasty blow. Others joined in, and for a
few moments things looked blue. But the central and
boundary umpires prevailed, and the game proceeded to
its close—Coliingwood, nine goals seven behinds; Carl-
ton, six goals 11 behinds.
Colhngwood, now 19 years old as . a . f . recor d
club, attains its fourth premiership. But jt e d
of which it is more proud : since the Leaguevv\a: B ™* e
in ’97 it has always been in the four to fignt out
finals. It has won 16 of the 21 games played the
last 10 consecutively ; and that this eD .
organisation is shown by the fact that, with thr
tions, it is the same team that ran third last ,
those three are youngsters from junior clubs
the wav they should go. It bought no stars. Carlton, tne
runner-up, also affords a lesson to the star ball
the advisability of training methodically and culti * t-
a modest demeanor. At the beginning of the season .
fired out its secretary, then it lost four stars to. l
Melbourne and one to Tasmania, then two more
disqualified till next year, and still later another P
were hung up. Yet it runs into the same position as last
year in spite of all. Also, to further show that it
management and the training that count,
some four clubs that battled out the finals this yea >
except for the temporary intrusion of St. Kuda. se
the places amongst ihemselves the last four years.
* * * *
At North Melbourne, on Saturday, Brunswick
and Essendon decided the Ass. preliminary premiers f
in a willing scuffle. If “ ructions ” premise genuine
hoofball, i hen the game was honest enough; ev ® n ,
first quarter the umpire had to call a halt and re .
the players that the ball was supposed to be th j-
they were concerned about. He was a. deter
umpire, and handed out penalties with splendid ’
but he couldn’t prevent the elbow-jab, the define * ■-
charge and even the clenched fist. There uasn tni
between the teams, but ’Wick’s straighter shooting nn(i
better system prevailed, and carried it home n.v n>
points—s 2 to 47. Next Saturday it plays North I
the right to fly the pennant. Attendance was 15,0 W, aim
takings £264. #
Amid the tales of Melbourne football-squaring
and so forth, one is pleased to hear of two teams t a •
take a serious view of the game. According to the a*
told to the Fitzroy Bench last week, these two tie
Carlton Emus and the Collingwood Fly away s— nan a -
pute over a recent game, and decided to settle the pom ■
per waddies, pickets, etc. So one evening, aiimit Hiu m
each party lined up in the neutral territory of Nichols
street, and a copious skirmish was about to ensue, w en
alone, solitary John occurred, and the engagement ter-
minated in the flight of both sides. One dilatory com-
batant was captured and handed “ 10s. or 48 hour. .
Thus does the honorarium discourage whole-hearte
sport.
* * "X *
As to the “scandal” of the previous week, the
League, when it came to investigate, discovered the
existence of a law of libel. Wherefore it trod daint j \ .
and closed its doors to the press. After pondering
a while, it disqualified two Carlton ’bailers for five years
each—which is a long time in a footballer’s ''fe.by the
way. The evidence against certain Fitzroy and Mel-
bourne players, who were alleged to have list-
ened to the seductive “squarer,” ultimately boiled
down to a statement that some irresponsible
party had offered a ’Roy man “thirty hob
—the same old 30 pieces of silver—to play dead. The
yarn and the offer were so obviously humorous that the
League chaffed the ’bailer about his tender conscience,
and handed the evidence to the press. The Ass. also
touched the fringe of an alleged scandal, in which a
Brunswick player was said to have offered certain coins
to a North Melbourne ditto to be deceased. Again
the evidence disclosed nothing remarkable ; but the Ass.
virtuously passed both players out for life, for “conduct
not conducive to the best interests of football.” Whatthe
public really wants is, not information about “fivers
and “ thirty bobs,” but sworn evidence as to the sums
paid by the men who bet in fifties and hundreds—-the
evidence the League wasn’t game to take. Simul-
taneously a humorous sort of inquiry was held by the
Ballarat League, a Golden Point ’bailer being accused of
giving an Imperial player 10s. to go stiff ; but the offer
was too munificent, and the delegates laughed the case
out of court.

Bronchitis
can be cured
by SCOTT'S
Emulsion
Bronchitis, acute or chronic,
is cured by taking Scott’s
Emulsion. Scott’s Emul-
sion permanently cures
bronchitis in all its forms.
This statement is made with
confidence because hun-
dreds of people have written
to say they were cured of
bronchitis by Scott’s Emul-
sion. For example, Mr. H.
G. Morton wrote, August
6th, 1909, from 25, Gould
Street, Sydney, N.S.W.:
“My daughter Maud, aged three years,
contracted bronchitis, and although
å
various preparations were
tried, she became so ill that
we were afraid we should lose
her. Then I tried Scott’s
Emulsion, and she im-
mediately obtained great
relief. She is now quite cured
and looks well and rosy. This
trademark ivas on the emul-
sion I bought. ”
If you wish to get rid of your
bronchitis, and decide to buy
Scott’s Emulsion, decide
also to GET SCOTT’S
EMULSION. You may be
asked to buy another emul-
sion and told it is “just as
good as Scott’s.” Substitute
emulsions can only be sold
on the reputation of Scott's
Emulsion.
Scott’s Emulsion cures the disease—
no matter the age of the patient—and
will be approved by your Doctor for
Bronchitis if you ask him.

THINGS A WOMAN GAN
SELDOM DO!
The great advantage of being a man, in some
people’s eyes, is that a man has much more free-
dom than a woman. Ordinarily he can go where
he likes and live where he likes. He may choose
his own trade or profession, and be the architect
of his own fortune. A woman can’t always do these
things, and in one other respect she is peculiarly
handicapped. A youth with sound health can
look straight down the road of life, and, unless
accident befall him, he stands a fair chance of
coming to hale old oge. But a girl cannot look
straight down the road, because there are critical
points beyond which she cannot see, turning points
which may be full of hidden dangers. The girl
who is
“ Standing with reluctant feet
Where the brook and river meet ”
is fortunate if she enters womanhood without find-
ing herself a victim to anaemia or some kindred
trouble. Later, when she becomes a mother, she
has a new series of dangers to face; and once
again, at the changeful season of life, she must
exercise every care if she is to enjoy a ripe old age.
Now, all doctors know that although women
have many more ailments to contend with than
can fall to the lot of man, nearly every one of
these ailments can be avoided so long as a woman
keeps her digestive organs in perfect working order.
That is practically the whole secret! When food
nourishes you and your blood is pure, you are sure
to feel weif.and be well. But when your stomach
and liver Are out of order, food cannot nourish
you,. because you do not digest it. Then, instead
of being turhed into good blood, to build up and
repair the waste of the body, food lies in the
stomach and creates poisons which pollute the
blood, clog the system, lower vitality and create
disease. This is the cause of nine-tenths of all
human ailments, and the real root of most of those
ailments which afflict women in particular.
If you want to be free from anaemia, headaches,
biliousness, constipation, languor, irregularities of
the system, debility and all kindred troubles, keep
your digestive system in thorough working order,
and all will be well.
There are many things which may cause your
digestive system to break down—overwork,
anxiety, hurried meals, weather changes—but,
whatever the cause, you can always speedily and
surely restore your stomach and liver to working
order by taking a short course of Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. This favorite family remedyfor all digestive
disorders is made of more than ten different roots,
barks and leaves, which in combination possess,
in a remarkable degree, the power of toning and
strengthening the stomach and regulating the
action of the liver and bowels. This is the secret
of its great success. It cures in a natural way,
and, better still, it cures permanently. The
Syrup is woman’s invaluable friend at every period
of life, and no household should ever be without
it.
On April 30th, 1910, Mrs. McGrath, 205
Berkley Street, Carlton, Victoria, wrote : —“ I
became subject to indigestion. My worst troubles
were feelings of suffocation and oppression at my
chest, and sharp pain in the back. After eating I
often felt as though I would vomit. A doctor said
I had chronic indigestion, and he feared I would
never get rid of it. Pills and medicines did me no
good. Then my mother persuaded me to try
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I took it for some weeks
and the result was a complete and perfect cure ! ”

“The Anchor”: The public has had a chance
to glimpse some of the internal workings of a fine old
Australian Tory banking institution. A bank clerk, after
having served three years, was handed an agreement to
sign, authorising the bank to deduct from his salarj a
percentage to serve as a premium to insure his fidelity.
In other institutions the employers pay the fidelity insur-
ance premiums, but in the banks the clerk insures hisown
honesty. Of course, the man need not have signed the
agreement—there is no law to compel anyone to insure
his fidelity—but a clerk who refused wouldn’t last beyond
the next pay-day. To “ sugar the pill ”it was promised
that if an officer spent his life in the institution he would
be allowed to retire at 60 on a pension (amount not speci-
fied). If he broke down through ill-health he would get
an annuity. This clerk served for 15 years, and, though
he was only paid £l7O per annum, reached the dignity
of branch manager. Not seeing any prospect of
becoming bloated at this rate of progress, he got
out and thought that he should receive some of
his contributions back. In other words, he reckoned
that there should be a surrender value to this policy;, just
as there is to other insurance policies. Justice and his
lawyers said “ Yes”; but Law and other lawyers “ No.”
So he gets nothing. Still, even this was magnificence
compared with the methods of at least one other bank.
In this institution the officers pay a per centage of their
salaries into a Fidelity Guarantee Fund. After doing it
for 21 years they are considered honest, and further pay-
ments cease. When they retire they are supposed to
have accumulated sufficient wealth toensure comfortable
old age. If they have not—well, it is hard luck for them-,
as the bank does not pay any pension or refund any of
the payments made, in spite of the fact that the fidelity-
guarantee premium it collects is about four times greater
than any insurance co. would charge.
* S *
The Melbourne Trades Hall Council lately got
on to an idea to show up the shamefully low rates at
which the piece-work pay of some women-workers has
been fixed by Wages Boards. It arranged a demonstra-
tion by three young expert white-workers. One made
ladies’ night-dresses, and earned at the rate of 4Jd. per
hour; another, on knickers, earned 3d. per hour; the third,
working on lawn blouses, made sd. per hour. This last
Croesus was the swiftest of the three, and her case was
specially interesting because experienced women present
stated that the blouse, one of the cheapest material and
simplest make, could not be bought for less than 3s. lid.
The material would eost Is. 3d., if bought from the ware-
houses ; and the white-worker made it up entirely—find-
ing machine, cotton, needles, oil, cartage, etc.—for 2£d.,
or 2s. 6d. per dozen. That blouse, sold at 3s. lid., cost
Is. Sid. ! Which is where the bargain-counter comes in.
* * * *
“Crass”: If it is true (which I extensively
doubt) that the Liquor party in N. S. Wales is helping
Labor, it must be a very different Bung party from the one
we have in Westralia. Here, there is nobody more con-
sistently anti-Labor and more consistently pro-Fat than
Mr. Pub Brewer. That has been made very clear over
the New Liquor Bill, which carefully side-steps the main
evil of the system—tied houses—and studiously turns its
deaf ear to such necessities as the strict application of
the Shops and Factories, the Health and other Acts. In
Kalgoorlie there are 25 hotels in one street, and three-
fourths of them are “tied” or semi-tied ; and “faked”
liquor, insanitary methods and sweating are the rule
rather than the exception. Still, the anti-Labor Govern-
ment in power turned its blind eye to all these things
when it was fixing up its new and “ strenuous” Liquor Bill.
* * * *
“Antiochus”: “Henry Horseeollar” (B. 18/8/’10),
searching for an honest brown man, could not find any
tinted gentlemen holding high positions; but I can teil
hitn of one instance in which the white plays second
fiddle to the brown. The steamer Ashburton (W. A. Steam
Navigation Go.) arrived here (Fremantle) on August 28,
On the ship’s articles appears: “ Chief steward, Luk Kuy ;
nationality, Chinese ; wages per month, £6. Second
steward, B—S—; nationality, British ; wages, per month,
£3." Of course, the crew are nearlyall Chinese. Let us
hope that we shall also soon give the command to an
intelligent Chinaman, and, going the whole hog, have a
Chinese chairman of directors too.
* * *
“Stony”: Somehow, even in these modern
times of cut prices and bargain sales, the middleman
scores off the purchasing person in an altogether out-
rageous manner. One wishes, say, to buy a yard of tooth-
picks. The price asked in town is sixpence a yard higher
than you have seen it marked up in the suburbs. The
explanation is, of course, readily forthcoming—“rents
are higher in town, y’ know.” In one’s own suburb, one
picks up a hot-water basket, perhaps. The price is a
shilling more than you have seen it placarded by Huckle-
berry and Dunn in the city. The reason given by the
shopman is that people who live in the suburbs “ have to
pay for the convenience of shopping at their doors.”
Yet suggest Government retail stores, and listen to the
roars of rage from the portly gentlemen in the retail
trade, who will want to know what they have done to
deserve even the suggestion of such a scandalous thing.
* * * *
“G.A.W.”: Old Underdown, wanting to en-
close all his land with a fence, gave his neighbor, Hux-
table, six months’ notice to toe the mark with half the
costs of the dividing line. This brought the usual reply
from Huxtable that no one was preventing Underdown
front fencing his land, and therefore he ought to go right
ahead. Underdown did go ahead and finished the fence,
and then placed the matter in solicitor Perks’s hands to
have the value of the structure determined by the Land
Board. Underdown, of course, won his case in a canter,
and the Board ordered Huxtable to pay £3O. Then
Huxtable sought Underdown, and hastened to shake
hands and make friends, and have a drink. While
they were having the drink Huxtablesaid it was a darned
good fence, and he would post a cheque for £3O within a
few days. The cheque came all right, but was returned
from the bank “ N.S.F.” Then a very angry Underdown
made a bee line for solicitor Perks. “ Take out an execu-
tion at once,” he ordered. But Perks urged him to wait
a few days till he made inquiries. These inquiries
went to show that Huxtable had £2B to his credit,
wherefore an execution wasn’t advisable at that junc-
ture. But Underdown said he knew Huxtable, and
the flaming cheque was no good, and never would be.
“ Well, if you like,” said Perks, “ I’ll give you £lO for it.”
“Right,” said the holder of the bad scrip ; “ it is yours.”
Mr. Perks, smiling sweetly, went to the bank and
dropped in £2 to make up the deficiency. Then, still
smiling sweetly, he presented the cheque for £3O again.
It was at this stage of the proceedings that Perks learned
that the other £2B had been drawn out.
A BEERSCAPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speaking at the jubilee of a Dover brewery firm, the
chairman said that if the bottles of beer sold by them
last year were placed end to end they would be 550 miles
in length. —English news item.
I reck not of the pathless wood,
The glowing steep, the hazy sea,
Nor mists of morn that softly brood
About the mountain’s ferny knee;
But my heart thrills at this I hear
Of nine score leagues of bottled beer 1
The isles of Greece in seas of wine
Moved with emotion Homer’s soul;
Bur, oh, by all the hopes that twine
Green tendrils round a Kentish pole,
This dream is to my soul more dear
Of five brown hundred miles of beer.
The lights that glint on Aipine snows.
The gems that gleam on beauty’s dress,
What are they to those shining rows
Aglow with malten pleasantness?
What are they to the sparkle clear
Of Dover’s crown of bottled beer?
The stars that twinkle in the night.
The moon that climbs above the sea,
The eyes of Sissy’s young delight
Are dim and nebulous to me
When, awed with some diviner fear,
I view that universe of beer.
Oh, take me somewhere in a boat,
Afar from mother, friends and home,
That softly I may float and gloat
Upon that hop-enchanted foam,
The surging breakers would I hear
That r 11 from seas of bottled beer.

It is in its Unique antiseptic properties that Odol especially
excels all other mouth-cleansing preparations* The complete dis-
infection of the mouth and teeth resulting from the use of Odol is
due to its remarkable power of suffusing the entire oral cavity with a
microscopically thin but thoroughly effective antiseptic coating which
maintains its protective influence for hours after the mouth has been
rinsed with it* While all other preparations for cleansing the mouth
and teeth act only during the few moments of application, Odol
continues to exert its antiseptic and refreshing powers, gently but
persistently, long after use*
TO OPEN THE ODOL FLASK: Twist the white metal cap to the left as
far as it will go ( about a quarter turn) when the small hole in the centre of the
cap becomes open. Then pierce through this hole the underlying parchment with
the metal pin supplied , and with a gentle shaking of the bottle the Odol can be
poured out as desired. To close the flask —as it should always be when not in
use—turn the cap to the right.
IN BANANA LAND
At least two Brisbane dailies have become
charmingly frank about Premier Kidston lately.
One of them alleges that in the matter of extrava-
gance he has out-Philped Philp, and goes into
figures to justify its allegation. Thq other one
alleges that he has been guilty of every dubious
political trick and financial device of which he
ever accused his opponents. What do the dailies
sniff in the wind ?
Toolburra, the last fragment of which was
sold the other day, was Peter Leslie’s great Dar-
ling Downs grab of the ’4o’s. Leslie went as
far as the Bremer, intending to go to Brisbane ;
but he had not a permit to enter the settlement,
so the party turned back to the Condamine.
“They were modest men,” says Arthur Morgan
in his historical sketch, “and contented them-
selves the country .from tfie bottom of the
Toolburra to the head of the Condamine, including
all tributaries,, a vast tr flct of thousands of acres.”
Subsequently they gave up the valley now known
as Gleng'dlon to, the Campbells, the Rosenthal
Creek to Bracker, and Sandy Creek to the Aber-
deen co. ;,,and.these made up the first stations on
the Darling Downs.
“ San Retno ” : Phidsfcon’s reason for re-
fusing to agree to occupy portion of the Common-
wealth building in London—that Queensland has
a long lease of its present premises—is as trans-
parent as a wireless sieve. The real reason is
just the usual State Insect’s desire to be a Nark.
When Kidston committed Bananaland to the
above-mentioiied long lease,' on his last visit to
London, he ought to have known that the Com-
monwealth intended to erect a Big Australia
office in that township. I say ought to have
known, in order to be quite fair. It’s just pos-
sible Kidston never heard of the Commonwealth.
Anyhow, he’ll hear directly, when Queensland is
debited with its share of the cost of the Com-
monwealth offices. When two rent-collectors are
battering at the front door, even a deaf man is
made aware of the disturbance—unless be is also
dead.
Mrs. John McDonald is Bananaland’s last
survivor of the bungled Barney expedition, which
tried to found a convict settlement at Gladstone,
Port Curtis, in’47. In those days she was Miss
Stokes, and was governess to Colonel Barney’s
family, and before that she taught Anglican
Bishop Broughton’s family how to shoot. When
the ship Lord Auckland reached the scene of the
projected settlement every arrangement was made
to fire cannon, and do the thing properly. But
the boat struck a sandbank off Facing Island,
and confusion took the place of rejoicing. At
length everybody got ashore, housed in 72
tents. The new colony spent 14 weeks in doing
nothing, and then tucker began to run out.
and discontent began to run in. Barney at this
lost his head—if he ever had any to lose so far as
empire building was concerned. The second
ship—Thomas Lowry—arrived at last. Barney
at once ordered all aboard, and the ship set sail
for Sydney. So Gladstone missed the ’bus, and
Brisbane in due time became the capital of the
northern State.
THE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER.
CORNCOB (discussing the new schoolmistress): “ Well, ye sez yer fair shook on her; and ’ere
ye ave yer 320 acres, a four-roomed 'ouse, and 70 cows.” (Emphatically) “ Why ,
all. ye got ter do is to arsk ’er! ”
BILL (mournfully): “ Yus; but ye see she carn't milk.”
“Itan”: There is a - cairn at RedclifF
station, near Hughenden, which seems to have no
place in black brother’s traditions. The stones
stacked are of fair size and well put together, and
the job must have kept a whole tribe busy for a
considerable time, None of the early explorers,
who journeyed that way, has left any reference
to cairn-building, although Latidsborough, accord-
ing to tree-markings, was thereabouts in March,
1862. Suggestions have been made that the cairn
was the work of explorers belonging to Spanish
expeditions, but the only authentie. traces of those
visitors are at Gladstone and on an island off
Mack ay.
Dr. IA. J. Gibson, recently appointed
Superintendent of Siigar Experiment Stations, is
a Bananalander, and belongs to the well-knowh
sugar-growing Gibson family. After picking up
some knowledge of sweet stuff on father’s planta-
tion, he.went to Hawaii to pick up more. Next he
went to Germany to add to the heap, and runj-
maged for it at the Brunswick—Sugar School, a
beet sugar-factory at Stralsund, the Technical
High School at Berlin, the Zurich University and
the Gottingen University. He is an M.A. and a
Ph.D., arid there isn’t a prohibition town any-
where which thirsts for beer as he, thirsts for
information. '
The Banner!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the year 1909 no fewer than 9000 citizens of the
United States were killed in railway accidents, while
95,000 were injured.— Recent cable.
Homicide in the' U.S. has become epidemic.— Recent
press comment.
’ J the blood-spangled Banner ! Oh ! How
doth it wave
O’er the land where they hustle in haste
to the Grave !
Where the Trust and its Rails are with Carnage
allied,
And you’re startled each hour by a fresh
Homicide.
’Tis the blood-spangled Banner ! O Children of
Cain,
What a shelter you’ve won from Nevada to
Maine !. . *
What a friend have you found, when for Refuge
you flee,
In the Home of the Brave -ancUtbe -Land of the
Free 1
On the hand of the White is the blood of the
Black,
And the blood of-both races is red on the track ;
For, however they bicker and bite in the brawl,
The Trust and its Lines are the Lords of
them all.
In the dawn, “To the West!” men exultantly
sang;
“To the West! To the West!”—how it' echoed
and rang !
And the millions came flocking for Labor and Life
To the land that is prey to the Trust and the
Knife.
And was this, then, the goal of America’s : Great-
This mad Minotaur of a man-killing State?
Did Lincoln and Hamilton labor and fall
That the Flag might be known as a Homicide’s
pall ?
’Tis the blood-spangled Banner ! Oh, crimsonly
dyed
Doth it wave o’er the foremost of peoples in
pride !
And Columbia can boast when her Colors are
flown,
Not a stain do they hear hut the blood of her own !
QUEENSLAND.
FURNESS BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP
Brisbane, October 1, 1910.
Mr Dear Thargomindah,—
Having arrived back from Southport, the vice-
regal folk will get to work right away, and in
half-mourning will start opening things. They
will commence with the Horticultural Society's
Show, at which the roses are to be visions and the
orchids a dream. Tea will be provided by the
gardenesses.
This day saw the season’s hatchings of the
Queensland Yacht Club and the Flying Squadron,
and the river was a tangle of boats and steamers.
The Lucinda, carrying far more than it should,
made a fine flagship, and a good note vvas
struck by Reg. Chapman’s Violet, which
carried canvas of the appropriate color. The
Yacht Club entertained in a big marquee
in the Hamilton reserve, where a band and
tea helped things along. Of the parties afloat,
Mrs. Cleghorn and Dame Hobbs had a crowd on
the new Humpy Bong steamer, while Commodore
Welsby and G. C. O’Bierne both carried fair
cargoes. The afternoon was sultry, but the breezie
was sufficient to keep things moving.
Forty Pioneers tore a bit of food in company at
the cafe with the unspellable name, and this made
one of the events of the week. Strangely enough,
there was not niuch talk.' The decorative Mrs.
Joey Bell was missed ; she is.still too anxious over
hubby to frivol much. But Mrs. Alfred Need-
ham, the oldest—no, the Pioneer whose name has
been longest on the roll—took the vacant chair;
and, although she only filled about a quarter of it,
she did that little excellently. j
Robert Philp addressed the Tory Women’s
Electoral League the other day in this fashion :
“ I believe the Women’s Electoral League would
make£l go further than the Men’s League would
£5.” Next day Philp’s colleague, Labor-member
Foley, discussing the Budget, informed the House:
“ All the finance I have had to do has been done
by the missus.” Evidently feminine finance is in
high repute in the city of Townsville.
The Scottish farmers’ commission is rolling over
the Downs, accompanied b.y politicians to supply
thp facts, and Archie Meston to look after the
trimmings. Brisbane reeks of haggis in antici-
patron of their arrival, and little Wulhe and
Andy are practising “ Scots Wha Hae, and the
Courier is spreading itself with pictures of every-
thing it can think of.
Edward Byrne, brother of the late T. J., passed
over the river this week. He had been ill for
some time in a private hospital. Nearly all the
men of that brainy family have now gone out.
Printed reports notwithstanding, weddings are
not, as a rule, particularly pretty, and the bride,
as often as not, looks more heated than anything
else. But the Paterson-O’Reilly knot-tying was
a notable exception. Miss Eileen brought a
gracefully-dressed head and falling lace-veil with
her charming little item of satin and lace into the
queer little wooden church at West End, and
brought it with an air of refreshing coolness. A
dainty sister was in frothy white, and pew after
pew of smiling young persons had gathered to see
the la3t of their chum. Also, there were lots of
men and effective decorations. Mrs. O Keilly
hung her graceful person in amethyst, and carried
a great posy of flannel flowers. Mr. and Mrs.
Pat, jun., have gone south.
Miss Joan Hart has been spoken to earnestly
by one of the Corfes, who come from Toowoomba
and own stations and other trifles. Later on she
will be treated to orange blossoms ; and, mean-
while, the post is heavy with congratulations.
Coincidence has stretched its long claw over
Parliament. Last session, two Labor men were
wedded within a week. On Wednesday—such
a lucky day—both Messrs. Theodore and Allen
were noticeably blushful, and strict investigation
was followed by the usual congratulations.
Horrid Rumor said last week that we were to
have another naval court-martial, and that the
proceedings were to be similar to the last al fiasco
entertainment. But before sending the necessary
gold lace from Melbourne to do the inquiring,
Captain Creswell wanted to know something of the
evidence, and finding that it was not of the wear-
ing variety, intimated that the much-discussed
affair was off. Yet another 4'7 shell struck naval
headquarters over Admiral Henderson’s visit.
Quite a pretty programme of manoeuvres had been
thought out. Then the news leaked to Melbourne,
and once again Captain Creswell, in a painfully
explicit wire, said that the visit of the sea dog was
not to interfere with ordinary training. Where-
fore all the gold buttons are wearing a hurt
expression.
Another small but popular person hereabouts
has vanished for the time being. Lieutenant Reggie
Plant sailed for India by the last Orient boat.
He can soldier and ride, and is chosen as one of
the exchange lots that the Army goes in for on
the circulating-library plan. As he is a keen
dancer to boot, he ought to enjoy himself in the
hills now and again.
Nothing, I suppose, would surprise a coroner,
but—well, it appears that a man getting on
towards the giddy eighties conceived the idea of
kicking a dead horse, and the dead horse, not
being as dead as the kicker could have wished,
kicked back with fatal results. Moral: Never
kick before the inquest. The miscalculation hap-
pened in the Schwabian German settlement of
Beenleigh, or thereabouts.
Some friends who, being at the enthusiastic
period, decided to solve the Mary Ann question,
castoff the help of Juliet Angelina, and hired a
backblock youth to tend the kitchen fire and do
sundries. He arrived from Thargomindah or
thereabouts, and proved a treasure. One evening,
however, when the girleens had a dinner party
on, his limitations became manifest. All went
well until tables were set and the food nearly done,
then Jhe ladies retired to get into their war paint,
leaving Aubrey to see to the fire. Presently they
sailed downstairs in dicolleU, with roses in their
hair, and so into the kitchen. Aubrey cast one
horrified look, fled down the paddock, and re-
fused to go kitchen wards until the girls put. their
clothes on again. Now, when they dine en fite,
they send the lad to a picture show.
Dr. Frackelton —he over whom the long kirk-
fight has raged—departed to Scotland by the last
White Star boat. There was a nice irony in the
attendance of, the choir at the vessel’s side, sing-
ing soothing melodies.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
An artesian flow was struck lately by the
Tinderry bore at a depth of 2450 ft. which is a
record for Western Queensland. Now, a little
matter of another 3,250,000 gallons a day is.gush-
ing out of Australia’s big underground tank.
Tinderry is in Thargomindah district, and Thar-
gomindah is, for its size, the boss champagne-
lapper of Queensland. If it could only change
the Tinderry flow into champagne, Thargomindah
wouldn’t take any stock in Paradise.
The Hampden-Mount Elliott beer-strike
has wound-ap in a compromise, on the basis of
sixpence for beers and a shilling for hard stuff.
Several cases of “black-legging” occurred, and
one notorious “scab” was dragged through a
bore drain, anointed with treacle and top-dressed
with kapok, while another was topped-off with
syrup and feathers. Bung in the Far North
always poses as being very straight Labor, and
this battle must have been a terrible shock to his
political convictions.

with the aid of a , '
B.S.A. MARTINI RIFLE
After having had considerable experience with other English and
American rifles says: —“The B.S.A. Martini is absolutely Unapproachable

You have probably got as far as you can with your present rifle,

To the man who wants a good, true-shooting, safe, reliable gun, but does not feel inclined to pay the price
of a high-grade Double 8.8. L., our “Colonial” S.B. Gun appeals strongly. It is undoubtedly the best
value that can be got for the money. The quality of materials in it, the special construction of reinforced
base and well-bored, full-choke barrel make it such a hard hitter, and has deservedly given it a reputation
of being one of the longest distance killers made, even when compared with other guns of five times the price.

MOST MEN would cure themselves of
the Tobacco habit if they knew they
could do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to

Stomach, Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless,
vegetable remedy that will make the user
of tobaccodn any form absolutely abandon
the habit- for good. It nut only destroys
the craving, the desire, the appetite for
tobacco, but restores to health the entire

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache —a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit- of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually bccomos quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.

MICK SIMMONS, syoney.
Storekeepers and Tobacconists should
send for our Trade Lists.
“S.R.”: As a result of winning: the choral champion-
ship at the recent Commonwealth Eisteddfod in Sydney,
the Blackstone and Ipswich (Q.) Cambrian choir will
probably be sent to Britain next year to compete at the
Welsh Eisteddfod. What is it makes these little Queens-
land mining- towns like Ipswich,Gympie, Mount Morgan,
etc., take music in such dead seriousness. Talk about
one man one vote—up there it’s one man one drum-
cornet or bass piccolo.
“Stargazer”: In the absence of a kind friend to
whisper in her neat ear, i want to ask Miss Katherine
Grey in Heaven’s name not Jto lay on that thick, trans-
verse line of black “ make-up” under her chin. The chin
is not pronounced enough for stage purposes, and the
aim is to bring it out, but the effect is to load the little
lady with 10 superfluous years. A jagged contour from
chin to throat is the most ageing infliction that can
smite a daughter of Eve. Better an unpronounced chin
than a marked artificial dew-lap. Tittell Brune exag-
gerated the same error.
“Pollio”: Dancing is, of course, a sort of religious
mystery, and Scots are an irascible crowd ; hut some
exceptionally mild-tempered McGregor might tell me
what is the national significance of short skirts in the
Highlands. The thing.ought to be worth knowing, since
it has made a Geelong man wake up. He says the Aus-
tralian public “ don’t understand the national signifi-
cance of the Highland dances,” and he therefore wants
to stop girls of 17 and over from “ dancing at Caledonian
gatherings in skirts cut short above the knee.” It sounds
irrelevant —but that’s why I want an explanation. (Also,
while the McGregor is about it, he might mention the
date and place of a few of the gatherings where this
happens. The box-office receipt# will not suffer.) I’ve
heard of a “cutty sark ” among Rabbie Burns’s young-
lady friends, but never knew she had attained to national
significance.
The Taits propose to add a show to St. Hilda’s tiara of
summer amusements. Their place will be adjacent to
the Esplanade, and will opep some time in October.
A company of eight or 10, including J. M. Campbell, late
of “ Aladdin,” will thump the beachcombers with song
and story ; but meantime the Taits can’t find a name to
fit the revellers.
“0.K.”: A songstress is as qld as she looks, but it
rarely happens that she is 10 years younger than she is
made out to be. Talking of the late George Howard, of
Melbourne, “ Johanna” says that his Conservatoire of
Music was christened by Dolores “ tvay back in the ’Bo's,”
after which “a broken boom made it impossible for Mel-
bourne people to support the school.” Dolores, under
her own original name of Antoinette Trebelli, came to
Australia first in June, 1896, when the land-boom was
already a thing with a Past. She gave concerts, at
the Melbourne Town Hall, with Maggie Stirling and
Walter Kirby as her supports, and she was present pre-
haps at the opening of the Howard Conservatoire, which
certainly was going strong later in that year. Antoinette
Trebelli, assisted by John Prouse, of Maoriland, : came to
Australia the second time "in 1891), and then she gave
“ recitals,” basso Prouse being only an occa-ional item
on the programme. A couple of years later she returned
as Dolores, for, in the meantime, she had heard that
people in Canada spoke of her as “ old Trebelli,” and
stopped away from her recitals under the impression
that she was her own famous mother.
“J.G.’f: The drop curtain painted by Habbe for the
old Melbourne Opera House in 1872, and now used at the
Guildhall (B. l/9/’10) was repeated for the Princess at
Bendigo, as well as for the Victoria at Sydney'. There
used to be any amount of.discussion among the Bendigo
theatre-goers, as well as among the dreadfully holy
(because the Bendigo playhouse is often used by the pro-
foundly holy) as to whether the curtain was a Venetian
scene or something else. Itmightbe Hampton Court and
grounds at the time of the giddy Charles 11., with a few-
big mountains and two almost equally' big swans to fill up
the background. This Bendigo curtain was used as a
background during the show run by the Chapzander
troupe a couple of years ago. The co. wasn’t above
using the theatre so that it could get a good gate, al-
though it professed to believe that theatres in general
were builttby'sin-stained devils, and should be shunned
by the really truly holy and the whirly-twirly dervishes
of the very best creeds.
Huber’s Museum, New York, which is, or was, one of
the famous show places of the States, is to be disbanded.
O.ne George Huber founded it over 30 years ago, and
stocked it with oddities. Tom Thumb was one of its
celebrities in its early days; and it drew large crowds
with |a wealthy freak, Myrtle Corbett, who came into
the world with four well-developed legs. Another
of Huber’s marvels was Bass, the ossified man, who
weighed 671 b., and was as rigid as a poker from
head to foot. Still another monstrosity was George,
“ the turtle boy',” who had grown a pair of flippers
in place of his natural understandings. Two freaks—the
Tocci twins and La Loo—were so unusual that they easily
secured salaries of 1000 aiid SOO dollars a week. The
Toccis comprised one body supporting a pair of comely,
if somewhat talkative, heads ; while La Loo was a head
attached to two separate and active bodies. A mode-
rately high-priced curiosity was a rarity named Billy
Munday, “ the man with the iron skull.” For a long time
Billy allowed- people to break rocks on his cranium,
until a particularly heavy blow sent him to bed for
several weeks. After that he became a ticket-seller at
the illustrious old freak-show.
“ Harrisbn O. ”: N’ York Dramatic Mirror publishes

much the same the world over. Eight or nine of the
pieces would probably be included in any list of the kind
compiled in this country, while in place of such plays as
“ In: Old Kentucky,” “ Hazel Kirke,” “ Way Down East ”
and “Peck’s Bad Boy,” we would have to include “Mr.
Beaucaire,” “ The Sign of the Cross ” and “ Sweet NelTof
Old Drury"—plays which have become popular here
chiefly because of the mummers who have mummed in
them.
BOTTLES ON THE FLOOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
When limelight streams upon the stage, ard gives the
hero-s int
A lovely, holy halo round his head,
The stalls and circle hold their breath, and flappers start
to faint,
Or hold some hand, and coo intensely “ Fred ! ”
When to the river’s brink the shrinking heroine is
tracked,
Strong men and women snivel by the score—
But the whole house rocks with laughter, though the
scene be pathos-packed,
When the gallery rolls its bottles down the floor.
The conscience-stricken traitor, white with fear and
goggle-eyed,
Orating with blood-money in his palm ;
The “fallen ” girleen, fainting on the church-steps, while
the bride
Steps up the crimson carpet, coldly calm ;
The diamond-studded villain, on a dark red murder
bent,
Alert outside the hero’s humble door —
All these things produce good laughter when, their utter
joy to vent,
Youthful gods go rolling bottles down the floor.
Ah, though brave Edgar draw long breaths to show his
soul’s in pain
As Eva sobs her story in the street,
The splendid situation cannot stand the frightful strain
Of glass cascading down from seat to seat;
Though plump, pathetic Horace lean across the dear
front gate
Where Alice is, and kiss her more and more,
He is not insanely happy, for he knows that soon or late
Cheerful gods will roll wild bottles down the floor.
VICTORIA.

S- ,!■*
The Roots Must Come Out,
as well as the Trunk.
POSITIVELY the hardest work the Farmer, Settler or Squatter is called upon to do is
grubbing. The old method of uprooting dry or green stumps and trees is now entirely
revolutionised by the introduction on the market of the most marvellous labor-saving
device for Farmers, etc., ever invented. It is called “The Bunyip Forest
Devil.” This particular Forest Devil is far superior to any other Forest Devil in the market,
in that it is the very essence of simplicity in adjusting and in manipulating. The most
admirable features of “ The Bunyip Forest Devil” are that it is not only light in weight
and can be moved with the greatest ease from tree to tree, where it can be rapidly fixed and
adjusted, but it is absolutely certain to accomplish almost any task set to it.
The tremendous strain which can be brought to bear with “ The-Bunyip Forest
Devil ” makes it absolutely imperative for the tree or stump to leave the ground entirely—
roots and all, no matter how big the tree or stump, how long it has been-growing, or how
firmly it be rooted in the ground. ■ ...
Many “land men,” once doubtful of the assertions claimed for it, are now loud in their
praises of the unbounded and entire satisfaction it has given in their case, and in many
instances they have paid for the cost of the machine in a very short while by hiring it to
their neighbors.
Convincing proof of its wonderful power and its durability, the quickness with which it
can be adjusted, the labor and money it saves, will be found in a special and attractive
catalogue Messrs. John Cooper & Sons, 287-289 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, have just issued.
Copies will be sent free to every enquirer, together with any other information required.
When writing, please mention this paper.

NO more positive proof of the worthiness of an “Alcock” billiard table could
be given than by the splendid performance of George Gray, the young
Queensland player, in his recent match with Fred Lindrum, jun.
A Standard “Alcock” Billiard Table was used, and certified to by the
Amateur Billiard Association of Victoria (which is affiliated with the Billiard
Association of Great Britain and Ireland).
Gray, who made 836—831 coming off the red, and thus making two world’s
records—used Crystallite balls, and the marvellous accuracy with which they came
off the cushions, the ease with which the most difficult shots were accomplished,
speaks for itself of the merit and superiority of ‘‘Alcock ” Billiard Tables.

“.Judkins ” writes a few personal remarks
Rbout some late members of the Jerusalem
Chamber of Commerce :
The idea that the Apostles were ppor men, with a
special mission to the poor, is all wrong-. There was not
a poor man amongst them (i.e., as “ poor ” goes). Peter,
Andrew, James and John probably paid less in stamp
duty for probate purposes than the others, yet even thev
were partners, together with old Zebedee, in a large
fishing business, and owned a fairish fleet of trawlers,
with headquarters at Capernaum. Peter and Andrew
were jobbing at Bethsaida before joining the firm
that afterwards became “Zebedee, Sons and Co.,
Ltd.” The co. had practically a monopoly in the
Capernaum and Lake trade. Peter was a good business
man, and the epithet of “illiterate,” that was thrown at
him in a recent obituary notice, referred to his ignorance
of Jewish law, of Hebrew and Hebrew text. Even Judas
Iscariot, regarded in some circles as a down-at-
heels crawler, was a smart business man when he
joined the Apostles during a week-end trio from
Judaea (Kerioth) to the Lake district. St. Paul was
also a wealthy man, although his father cut him
adrift when he joined the Christian Church. Paul
worked a mission to the upper crust, and that the plate
panned out well is shown by the fact that Governor Felix,
of Judaea, expected a substantial tip to free him under
the First Offenders Act, Similarly with Luke, Mark,
Barnabas, Matthias, Apollos, Aquila and Priscilla, and
most of the other leaders of the movement—thev
were all well-to-do citizens with a stake in the country
and their names, figuring in the income-tax office. As a
matter of fact, they probably did as well, in a way, as
Chapman, Alexander and co. The only difference is
that there were more risks then, and the pubs were not
so comfortable.

FOOD
Wherever there is a
case of enfeebled diges-
tion, whether from ad-
vancing age, illness, or
general debility, there is a
case for Benger’s Food.
When the stomach becomes weakened, the digestion of ordinary food
becomes only partial, and at times is painful, little of the food is assimilated,
and the body is consequently insufficiently nourished. This is where Benger s
Food helps. It contains in itself the natural digestive principles, and is quite
different from any other food obtainable.
All doctors know and approve of its composition, and prescribe it freely.
The British Medical Journal says : “ Benger's Food has, by its excellence, established a reputation of its own,”
BENGER'S FOOD, LTD., Otter Works, Manchester, Eng
Benger's Food is sold in tins by Druggists, etc., everywhere. 831
Are You a Bad Writer ?
a
Many people imagine themselves “Bad” writers when the real
fact is that they have never succeeded in getting a pen which suits
them. Here are the pens for all so-called “Bad” writers!
Ball-Pointed Pens
neither stick in the paper, scratch, nor spurt.
Why? Because you write on the face of a small Ball. Ball»
Pointed Pens can be had with fine or broad points. Ask your
stationer for a 6d. Sample Box. Commercial Men find them
wonderfully “easy.” Ladies say they are “just delightful.”

LOOK OUT for
SPRINC DANCERS!
NOW is the time to be on the “look-out” for the dangers of Spring—
dangers from within as well as from without. A besieged fortress
after a long siege is not only more watchful of danger from attack
by an enemy without, but also of danger from weakness within. The
human system, after the long siege of Autumn and Winter, is weakened
through over-work—over-work of all the digestive organs which have had
to cope with the extra food consumed (a necessity during the cold months),
and over-work caused by resisting the attacks of colds and chills. The
weakened system is less able to withstand the renewed attacks of the
changes of temperature, and must be toned up. There is no tonic like
Bile Beans, because they are purely vegetable, ana assist the over-
worked organs to cope with the demands of Nature and gradually
restore them to their normal condition, so that they are again able—
unaided—to perform their natural functions. With the system so
toned-up you can withstand the many dangers that lurk in the Spring-time.
Mrs. E. E. Johns, of Victoria Street,
Lewisham, Sydney, says:—“Bile Beans are
an ideal Spring medicine, and a box of them
should be in every home. I have used Bile
Beans for myself and family for years, and
can highly recommend them. A friend of
mine, residing in Victoria, first sent me a box
of the Beans some years ago, and now I
would not be without them in the house. I
have a large family, and at Spring-time and
other changes of season, give them Bile
Beans, which ensure their good health.”
THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
Bile Beans are a proved remedy for biliousness, headache, indig'estion, stomach troubles,
constipation, piles, debility, female ailments, nervousness, bad blood, bad breath, anaemia, dis-
turbed sleep, loss of appetite, Spring ailments, and, In fact, all ailments that owe their origin
to defective liver action. Obtainable everywhere at Is. I£d., or 2s. 9d. large box (containing three
times the Is. IJd. size); or post free from The Bile Bean Mfg. Company, 39 Pitt Street, Sydney.

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the sKin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears* Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,

eminent degree as

The Great Country.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE’S a country overseas
With a great arid glorious name ;
She has ships along her quays
Bearing wares from every port.
And a king, likewise a Court.
Through a thousand warring years
She hewed and hacked her foes;
And her peasants and her peers
(Lest their country came to harm)
Valiant were of heart and arm.
She has many, many swords,
Bright of blade and keen of edge;
She has ladies, she has lords ;
And the world beholds her state,
And it calls that country great 1
She can make and she can mar,
For her lightnings strike to blast;
She has iron ships of war,
And her captains great of name
Are inheritors of fame.
Many times she wrought for good—
Spoke for Freedom—freed the slave;
Many times, in noble mood,
Gave asylum unto those
Flying hot-foot from their foes.
Her rich, a mighty host,
Eat of plenty, bask at ease ;
With such Wealth and Power to boast,
Though pale Envy jeer and prate,
Sure a country must be great !
Yet, ’tis said when revelry
Lights her many-mansioned streets,
Faring there a man may see
Sights o’ Hell to make him quail—
Faces gaunt and starved and pale.
Shadow-thin, they lurk and flit,
Folk of night, for with the dark
Open-mouthed the reeking Pit
Vomits out them, score on score,
Flesh and blood—but men no more.
Do you call yon ghost a man ?
Oh, the travesty, the shame 1
And yon shadow, shrunk and wan,
Was a woman sweet and good? . . .
Well, what wrecked her womanhood?
When the wolf-hunt is abroad,
And the slums are loosed at night,
And their pale and famished horde
Seek a crust at door and gate—
Do they call their country great?

RODERIC QUINN.
“Go Away, Dooley.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
mSIS is the plain and simple history of
| Joseph Nolan, Esq., arid' of how he rose
from the occupation of navvy and farmer
to be “spacious in the possession of dirt.’’ It
would be an excellent story for Sunday-schools
and Bands of Hope, but for one obvious blemish.
Luke Dooley and Joe Nolan were mates. They
came out together from County Clare (God help
us !), and, on arrival, worked beside each other in
many a navvy’s camp. They saved enough to
select adjoining farms in the Goulburn district of
Victoria, and- then looked around for wives. They
both wanted Mary Byrnes, the good-looking
daughter of a cockatoo farmer in their vicinity,
but she favored Dooley, and, according to his
habit, Nolan gave way to his mate. Dooley was
a short, active, curly-headed man, who was clever
enough, but not nearly as clever as he thought
himself. He was as keen as a razor in a deal, and
not too scrupulous. Big, generous-hearted Nolan
thought him the ablest man in the world, so
Dooley was the dominant partner in the mateship.
Then Dooley saw Theresa Bradyj the only
daughter of a well-to-do farmer nearSheppartori,
and he transferred his attentions to her. From
that time Mary Byrnes hated Dooley, with the
hate of a woman scorned. It was Joe’s oppor-
tunity, and he courted Mary successfully. The
two men married, and for a time did well. Then
Dooley, who was ambitious and enterprising,
heard of the great opportunities in Queensland
foit men of limited capital. He urged Nolan to
go with him, and they went.
This!was in the early ’Bo’s, when the great in-
vasion of Queensland by Victorians and Victorian
capital was at its highest. Cash was being spent
by hundreds of thousands in station improve-
ments. Dooley saw great possibilities of making
money easily. He erected a public-house on the
main travelling stock-route between Jamesville
and Bullahbunna; while Nolan took tank-sinking
contracts, and occasionally did a bit of fencing.
They did so well, that they sent for their wives
and children, and became Queenslanders.
" While the improvement boom lasted the for-
tunes of Dooley boomed, and he was in a position,
within a few years, to take up for himself and
wife two 20,000-acre blocks, under the Dutton
Land Act. These ran to within a mile of the
pub, and not very far from where Nolan was
carrying out a fencing contract.
Mrs. Nolan came in occasionally to visit Theresa
from the rough camp where she, Joe and the three
children lived, and heard with envy of the sums
. the Dooleys were making. And when she learned
that they were on the way to being squatters, her
•envy and hatred of Dooley became almost a
ifrenzy.
The day came when Dooley saw that station
improvements were nearly completed in the dis-
trict; and he believed that the pub would shortly
be a poor affair. It was time to get out, and he
was looking about for a likely customer, when,
•one day, Nolan happened along.
“ The job’s nearly done. Luke,” he said. “ an’ I
was told yisterday that there’s no more to folly.
What I’ll do next, I dunno. Ye can’t advise me,
I suppose ? ”
“Have ye done well, Nolan?” asked Dooley,
after a thoughtful silence.
“Not bad. We have med £252 out av this
•conthract—Molly’s just med it up—an’ with that
an’ what we got for the farm, an’ some more, we
4iave six hundhred an’ twinty-two pounds, two
shillun’s and a thrifle. Molly’s talkin’ av takin’
a pub.”
“Hum,” said Dooley. “ It’s not a bad idee at
all, if ye can only get a place as good as the R’yal
Oak, kep’ be Luke Dooley. I have med —let me
see—two an’ t’ree is foive—foive an’ sivin is
twelve—twelve an’ eight is—is—is twinty. I
have med two thousand pound here on this very
slipot. I have the R’yal Oak yet, an’ the shtation
beyant to come an’ go on.”
“Shureme an’Molly knows that it’s ye that
med a power av money here. An’ she wants to
do the same,” said Joe.
“I don’t blame ye. It’s a wearin’ business
though, an’ I’m thinkin’ av givin’ it up an’ goin’
on to me shtation to be a shquatter. ’Tis a fine
life. I’m told.”
He looked hard at Joe when he said this, and
was gratified to see that the fish had risen to the
bait, .loe’s face was shining with excitement.
“ Will ye sell ?” he asked, eagerly.
“At a price, Joe. It’s a rale good thing.”
“What will ye be wantin’for this fine pub?”
asked Joe.
“Six hundhred an’ twinty pounds cash, walk
in walk out. If ye haven’t the money I don’t
mind waitin’ a bit fer the odd twinty.”
Joe’s face fell at this. He knew that, all
told, Dooley had only spent £250 on the place,
and he was disappointed to hear that it
would cost all lie had to buy in. He said,
after turning the matter over in his mind :
“ Molly an’ me an’ the kids will be cornin’ in for
good in a day or two. I’ll see what she sez. It is
a lot av money. Ye'll lcape it for me, Luke, till I
see what herself sez?”
“I’ll sell to the first comer wid the cash, Luke.
There’s no friendship in business. The shtation
people wants it badly to close it up. They think
the min sbpend too much money here.”
Two days later Joe and his family came in, and
camped by the waterhole at the back of the hotel.
Then the negotiations started. It was a fine
time for everybody concerned. While the boys
of the two families played and fought with each
other, the elders haggled over the sale for three
clear days. At first Dooley ignored Mrs.
Nolan and addressed himself solely to Joe,
who, he saw, would make short work
of the matter by giving the full price
asked. Mrs. Joe listened for a while to the
flowery accounts of immense profiit— accounts
which were nearly half true. She interfered only
when she saw that Joe was so impressed that he
was about to close the deal at Dooley’s price.
Then she said to her husband : “Get out av this,
Nolan. Ye arre too soft for Mishter an’ Mrs.
Dooley. Six hundhred an’ twinty pounds ! An’
it’d be more if ye wasn’t an old mate!! Go
away an’ play wid the byes, an’ see that yeer own
gets fair play among the Dooleys, or they’ll be
aitin’ them.” She then took full charge of the
negotiations, and in the end the place was bought
for £4OO. The Dooleys went to their “shtation,”
fenced it, and bought sheep. To do so Dooley
borrowed money from one of the companies which
were so eager in those days to finance anything in
the pastoral line. They became great swells, in
their way; and the boys were sent to Nudgee
College “to be med gentlemen,” as Theresa told
Mary.
For a few months the Nolans did well, and
then, as Dooley had foreseen, the army of fencers,
tank-sinkers and builders followed the retreating
wave of improvement money to other districts,
and the pub was left high and dry. Mrs. Nolan
had the mortification of seeing her visions of
affluence melt month by month as receipts
dwindled.
As the Dooleys increased in importance Mrs.
Nolan saw added insult whenever Luke came
over in a lordly way to show off and patronise his
old mate. She was nearly frantic when she heard
of the grand doings of the Dooleys, and she would
have given one ear to believe that they were un-
true, but the evidence was too clear.
“ How would ye like to melt a t’ousand pounds
in wan little week, Joe?” said the new squatter
on one of his occasional visits.
“ It’d be grand,” said Joe. “ Have ye done it?”
“I have that,” said Dooley, “I bought five
t’ousand. wedders from Tinnenburra for four bob.
I’ll lcape them on me shtation an’ shear them, an’
get four bob’s wort’ av wool frum them, an’ have
the sheep besides.”
Joe said: “Good an ye, little man! It’s
grand.”
Mrs. Nolan gave a snort of derision, and said :
“ I don’t belave a worrd av it. It ain’t possible.”
“Here ye arre, then,” said Dooley triumph-
antly, pulling letters and telegrams out of his
pocket and handing them to Mrs. Nolan. She
read them, and, too angry to be polite, went off
without another word. Dooley said : “ Herself
seems put out, Joe. What’s the matther ? ”
Joe shook his head. “She is disappinted that
the pub’s doin’ bad. We haven’t med’ tucker fer
three months.”
“Deter, dear, dear!” said Dooley. “Is that
so? An’ it was the fine payin’ place whin I
managed it.” He looked sorrowful and said :
“ There must be somethin’ wrong, Joe.”
Mrs. Nolan came to the door, and said angrily :
“Yes, Dooley, there is something wronsr. tin’
it’s sittin’ in my parlor dhrinkin’ my tay. What’s
wrong is Joe an’ me havin’ annythmg to do wid a
sharper like ye. We’ll niver have luck till we’re
quit av ye. Put that in yer pipe and shmoke it.”
Dooley rose and said, “Theresa, we must be
goin’. We arre not welcome in me old mate’s
house.”
But the final breach came later. Dooley was
riding along his boundary one morning, and when
he came to the waterhole which lay between the
pub paddock and his own country, he saw Nolan’s
lads busy cooking at a fire. He rode cautiously
around the head of the waterhole and, sneaking
up, discovered the remains of a pig. Then his
wrath exploded.
“Ah-ha, me byes! I have cot ye, have I?
What arre ye aitin’ there? ” he bellowed.
“ Pig,” said Tim, laconically.
“Ye thavin blaggards ! What do ye mane by
it? It’s my pig.”
“Ye are a liar, Dooley. It’s a clane skin, an’
has nary earmark,” said Tim.
Dooley knew that the Nolans had no pigs, and
feeling that he was justified, he proceeded to
chastise the insult as well as the theft. The boys
promptly rolled him into the waterhole and
pelted him with clods while he was in.
A muddy, cursing apparition got on to a horse
andh-ode furiously' to the pub.
Mrs. Nolan was standing on the verandah.
“ What do you want, Dooley?” she asked.
“ I want to see .Joe.”
“ What do ye want wid him ?” she asked again.
“ Shure ye are in a fine mess.”
“Those thaves av byes av yours have done it.
They t’rew me in the wather an’ pelted mud at
me, because I cot them aitin’ wan av my pigs.
I have come to tell ye that I am sendin’ for the
poliss.”
“How do ye know it was your pig? They
are great wandherers.”
“ Who else but me has pigs out here ? Anny-
ways, it’s the thraps will be out in the mornin’,

THE WELL-ADVISED NEVER NEGLECT
KIDNEY DISEASE.
The best advice that can be given to anyone suffering
from urinary troubles, weakness of the bladder, backache,
headache, watery swellings round the ankles or under
the eyes, constant tiredness, dizziness, broken sleep,
ringing in the ears, or irregular heart, is to take Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills at once, for they cure the kidneys,
and therefore cure all these symptoms of kidney and
bladder disease.

Good Advice
From a Sydney Mam
Mr. W. B. Lewis, 10 Laura Street, Newtown, Sydney, states : “There is no
medicine more satisfactory or really beneficial, that I know of, than Doan s Bac -
ache Kidney Pills. Much sickness and broken time would be avoided, especially by
those who, like myself, are occupied at out-door work if these pills were better
known. One of the many advantages about Doan’s T.ackache Kidney Pills is that
they may be taken with perfect safety at any time. I suffered from the kidneys for
some time, and was recommended to try them, and they gave me great relief. My
friends to whom I have spoken of their excellent effect speak in similar terms of
them. I have no hesitation in saying that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are the most
comforting, and most certain to give relief, of any kidney medicine 1 have ever tried.
Seven years later, Mrs. Lewis: “My husband has not suffered with his
kidneys since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him seven years ago. This
remedy is worth its weight in gold to the kidney sufferer.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all chemists and storekeepers, at 2s. 9d. per
bottle (six bottles, 15s. 3d.), or posted on receipt of price by Poster-McClellan Co, 76 Pitt

Eczema.
4 Years Cured.
Mrs. J. Fletcher, 81 Bellevue Street, North
Sydney, says “ For some months I suffered
with a form of Eczema, which broke out on
my legs and arms. The irritation was so
dreadful at night that I could not sleep. I
used a great number of remedies, hut none of
them gave me any ease. I commenced to
think that there was no cure for Eczema, but
a treatment of Doan’s Ointment proved that
I was wrong in this. The first application
gave me ease and a few pots cured me. To
all who suffer with Eczema, I recommend
Doan’s Ointment.”
Mrs. Fletcher makes a second statement
“It is now four years since Doan’s Ointment
cured me of Eczema, and I have never had a
sign of the ailment since. I will always
praise Doan’s Ointment for my quick and
lasting cure. Sufferers should not waste time
and money using other remedies, but should
get Doan’s Ointment at once—it cured me,
and will cure other sufferers.”
DOAN'S OINTMENT
CURES TORTURING SKIN IRRITATION,
Piles.
12 Months Cured.
Mr. J. Gr. Carter, jun., 182 Bulwayo Road,
Ultimo, Sydney, says:—“l can strongly
recommend' Doan’s Ointment. For two years
I suffered agony from protruding and itching
Piles; the pain and irritation were almost
unbearable. I could scarcely get about, and
could not sleep at night. I was very bad,
and could not get relief, although I tried
everything I could hear of, and got treat-
ment from doctors. Fortunately Doan’s
Ointment was recommended to me. I com-
menced to use it, carefully following the
directions. Relief came after the first appli-
cation, and I persevered with the treatment
until I had used three pots. I am abso-
lutely right, and it is twelve months since I
used the Ointment. Seeing how good Doan’s
Ointment proved for Piles, I used it for
Eczema, which had broken out all over me ; it'
was very painful and itchy, as well as most
unsightly, but Doan’s Ointment again proved
its genuine merit, and absolutely and com-
pletely banished all trace of the ailment.”
Doan's Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d •
per pot, or post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
an’ it will be seen if a pasthorialist is to be
robbed be thaves of publicans, like ye Nolans.
An’ ye, too, that was breakin’ yeer neck to catch
me, as Theresa sez.”
Mrs. Nolan turned her head and said: “Joe,
d’ye hear him ? The great an’ mighty Dooley,
that’s robbed ye often enough himself, calls us
thaves. An’ he’s lyin’ about yeer own wedded
wife. An’ he’s turnin’ informer. Ye can see
yeerself now what he is. Bate him, or "I’ll never
spake to you agen.”
Joe rushed out, shouting : “ Come off the horse,
Dooley, an’ I’ll bate you for what you are sayin’.”
Joe might have overlooked the accusation of
theft against the boys, but he could never forgive
the insult to his wife and the threat of sending for
the police. Dooley galloped off without another
word. Physically, he knew that he was no match
for his old mate. He went home, and was angrier
still when he found that not one of his pigs was
missing.
It really seemed as if Mrs. Nolan was a pro-
phetess when she told Dooley that friendship
with him had brought bad luck to the Nolans.
There came a change in the fortunes of the Royal
Oak, The advent of shearing brought shearers
and general laborers in droves to the new country,
and the large number of flocks on the roads
brought others, so the hotel began once more to
pay well.
Mrs. Nolan had always intended to take up land,
like the Dooleys, when the time came. When
the blocks opposite the Royal Oak Hotel were
resumed and thrown open for selection, she made
a plunge and took up two of them. She sent out
Joe and the boys to fence them in, and, inci-
dentally, scored off Dooley in the process. Dooley’s
east and west fence ran with Nolan’s boundaries ;
but there was a road surveyed along it, out to the
blocks at the back. She ran the back fence right
into Dooley’s fence, and applied for a licensed
gate through it on the road. She would have to
fence it in within three years; but, in the mean-
time, she had the use of the road and Dooley’s
fence without payment. That saved nearly £3OO
for three years. Dooley claimed, through a law-
yer, for half the expense of his fence. Mrs.
Nolan laughed, also through a lawyer, and
pointed out that he would have to claim from the
Lands Department. His fence abutted on a
Government road. True, hers did, too; but she
had three years in which to fulfil the conditions
of her license. Dooley had to suffer it.
Then came a very dry time, and Dooley, who
was over-stocked, found himself pinched for feed.
He could not get a penny more advance on his
already overburdened place, and saw that he
would either have to find relief-country or see his
stock perish before his eyes.
Tn 6 Nolans’ blocks, which they called “ Innis-
farne,” were quite unstocked, and there was
plenty of good feed. Dooley cast a longing
eye many a time over his fence at the fine country
which was “ so near and yet so far,” and he made
up his mind to swallow his pride and try his old
mate for permission to agist his sheep on Innis-
farne. But others had also noticed 40,000 acres
of good feed and water, and had bid high for it.
One day the Nolans signed an agreement with a
neighboring station to let Innisfarne for six
months at the rate of £3OO per month, with the
right of renewal if necessary. That was the day
on which Dooley came to patch up the old
friendship.
“Shure, Joe,” he said, smoothly, when he
came to the Royal Oak, “ it’s long sence ye an’
me has had a talk about old times. I sez to Theresa
on’y yisterday : ‘ It’s a shame, so it is, two fami-
lies which has known aich other so long shud be
at loggerheads about a thrifle of a few hasty
worrds. She t’ought the same, an’ she sends a
thrifle av vegetables over for the table. Here’s
me hand, an’ we’ll let bygones be bygones.”
He held out his hand to Joe, who looked at it
sheepishly. Then Mrs. Nolan intervened.
“What are ye lukkin’ at, Nolan?” she said.
“ Why don’t ye tek the hand of the dacent man ?
It has nevet been withdrawn from ye when it
needed annything. Tek it Joe, an’ see what the
poor felly wants. Mebbe he has come to help us
shtock our counthry wid his own sheep. His own
place is dhry an’ bare, I hear.”
Joe drew back, and Dooley, nothing abashed,
said: “ It’s thrue, Molly, in a sense. I cud do
wid a bit av grass for me yowes for a few weeks,
an’ I am willing to pay for it.”
“How much? An’ for how manny?” asked
Mrs. Nolan, sharply."
Dooley considered, and said : “ Betune friends
now. I’ll pay you tin pounds a month for 6000.”
“D’ye hear him, Joe?” said Molly, triumphantly.
“Tin pounds a month, an’ here’s signed papers
from the Bundalore people, who’s payin’ £3OO a
month an’ for six months at that. Go away,
Dooley, an’ tek yeer green stuff wid you. Ye can
tell Theresa that the pub ain’t bad undher the new ■
management aftner all. We cleared £3OO sence
July, an’ it’s on’y November. Go away, Dooley,
an’ be thankful himself is a quiet man, or ye’d have
every bone in yeer ugly carcase broke.”
Dooley looked at Joe, and said pityingly : “It’s
sorry I am that ye let a woman’s tongue come be-
twixt yeerself an’ the best friend ye ever had.
Ye’ll never have anny luck.”
“Luck,” said Joe. “ All me luck has come, as
Molly sez it would, sence ye an’ me quarrelled.
I’m thinkin’ Molly’s cleverer than e’er a Dooley,
an’ I will always listen to her. Go away, Dooley.”
Matters went from bad to worse. Dooley’s
accounts were strictly audited by the pastoral
company at short and varying intervals. In an
attempt to sell stock without its consent he was
found out; and after that he was noted down as
a slippery customer. The account became irre-
trievably bad as the years of the Big Drought
went on. Dooley tried to persuade other com-
panies to take over his business, but without suc-
cess. This, too, was remembered against him
when the day of reckoning came. Meanwhile
the Nolans went along doing, in spite of the bad
times, very well. Scrdb-cutting was general on
all .the big properties, and the scrub-cutters’
money kept the hotel going. Although little
could be done with the selection, there were
occasional windfalls which paid the rent and a bit
over. Innisfarne had never been overstocked,
and consequently a small fall of rain made grass as
it would never have done on land which had been
overstocked for years and eaten out. So there was
often grass for sale. When Mrs. Nolan had enough
money she bought 6000 ewes for 3s. per lies ~ A
week after they were delivered on Innisfarne the
drought broke', and from that time the Nolans
never looked back. .
Doolev’s company had never forgiven him, and
12 months after the great rains which ushered in
the most prosperous period of Australian history,
they sold'his pl&Qe behind his back to the Nolans.
He could see that in 12 months more he would be
on his feet again, and was rapidly becoming his
old pompous self when the blow came.
It was the greatest moment of Mary Nolan s
life when she went over to Dooley with the papers
of the sale in her pocket and the rge. t of the
company alongside her in the bugg.>. bhe left
Joe at home. -
Theresa met her as she came to the door, bne
was distinctly not effusive.- She asked : What
brings you over here, Mrs. Nolan ?”
“Ihave come to talk business with Misther
Dooley, ma’am. Is he in ?”
“He is. Luke !” she called, “here’s somebody
or another wantin’ to speak to you.”
Dooley came to the door, and was an angry
man when he saw his visitor. He said : “ The
lasht time I had spache wid ye, I was told : ‘ Go
away, Dooley’; an’ now, in me turn, I say :‘ Go
away, Mrs. Nolan.’”
He was turning to leave her, when the agent
stepped forward and said : “I have to tell you,
Mr. Dooley, that Mrs. Nolan is the owner of
these blocks. They were sold last week to her,
and I am here to give delivery.”
Dooley almost died with anger and fear. He
said, when he could speak: “Oh, Molly, ye’ll
never do ut to an ould friend ? ”
“ Yes, an’ more, too. Ye weren’t satisfied to
rob old Joe, but you must thry to tell him
his wife was a shameless hussy; an’ I have had it
in for you for 18 years for what ye know av too.
An’ now I'say,an’l mane it: ‘Goaway, Dooley.’”
And Dooley went away. Often, afterwards,
he begged assistance from his rich old pastoralist
friend, Joseph Nolan, J.P., and it was not often
withheld. Dooley tells everybody that he made
the Nolans, by putting them into the pub where
they got their first start.
TARBOY.
Nocturne.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE sun that shone like
A glowing crown,
Has set in splendor
On Sydney town!
The twilght falls, as
An azure cloud
Enwraps and softens
The city proud ;
And onward up to
The stars ascends,
And with the outposts
Of Heaven blends !
Likeidjisky ships on
A darkening sea—
Like fleets that follow;
A fantasy,
The grey clouds vanish,
By night-winds blown
Unto the verge of
The great Unknown !
The plying ferries
Blaze tier on tier,
Reflected lights in
The sea appear
As flaming circles
That flash and twine
Through dances mazy
And serpentine;
As swift light-spirits
Whose efforts tire
To sound the sea with
Their spears of fire l
Lamp after lamp
Bursts out and burns—
The gathering darkness
The city spurns;
Shuts out, forgetting
That at her gate
The hungry breakers
Remain in wait 1
The wild sea-lovers
That ramp and rave,
And evermore for
Her beauty crave;
That fling-their passion
Of spray on high,
And at her outposts
In thunder die;
Through centuries and
Through centuries,
Till they at last on
Her beauty seize !
The ousted Night with
Its thousand eyes,
Gazes on her from
The cold, dark skies;
And still shall gaze when
Her grey walls be
A broken record
Of History;
And still shall gaze when
Her ruins spread
Beneath the desolate
Ocean-bed !
For Ocean lives but
For that dim age,
When she he loves is
His heritage;
And the prisoned Harbor
Dreams by the shore
Of days when it shall
Be free once more :
The Sea-wind 3 tell of
The Sea’s caress—
The Night’s wide spaces
Upon her press !
But the city, heedless,
Lifts spires of pride
To the starry chariots
That o’er her ride !
Passionate life in
Her heart beats high—
Her ears are deaf to
The Ocean-cry 1
The.’stately city
Beside the sea,
Facing dark-veil&d
Futurity!

PUBLIC OPINION
is generally sane and trustworthy. It is only on really insignifi-
cant and unimportant matters that the sense of the community is
ever at fault. The sentiments and opinions of the world are more
likely to be right than those of the isolated critic. This is partic-
r ularly true of such matters as must be decided by the test of expe-
rience. What the majority have proved in practice to be true
ought to weigh with us as an established fact. Now if there is one
question more than another on which public opinion is unanimous
it is that the excellence of BEECHAM’S PILLS as a family medi-
cine is unsurpassed. Their universal popularity has very suitably
been expressed in the world-famed expression
