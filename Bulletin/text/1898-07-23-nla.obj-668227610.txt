Interesting to Brandy and Whisky Drinkers.
rpHE imports of case Whisky during the year 1897 amounted to 115,357 cases,
1 those of case Brandy to 43,723 cases. These figures exhibit a marked increase
in the consumption of Brandy, and show a strong tendency of the public to revert
to that spirit as their favorite drink. It was thought by many that the consumption
of Whisky was fully eight cases to every one of Brandy, whereas the proportion is
only about 2| to 1. . . . The wholesomeness of
Joshua Brothers’ Australian
BOOMERANG BRANDT,
attested by the highest authorities, and its adoption by the House of Commons, the
War Office, leading hospitals and clubs, etc., has tended to bring about the above
result. In Cases, Casks, Plasks, and Half-Flasks.

Recent Verse.
In Issue of Jan. 15 was reprinted that freakish,
Blakish thing appearing anonymously in the
famous “ Wit and Drollery ” miscellany—“ Tom
of Bedlam.” To people with a poetio sense it is
one of the most fascinating fancies in English.
Now comes Francis Thompson in The Dome and
of the fine fragment makes a very fine poem. He
omits the insanest verse—
The moon embraces her shepherd,
And the Queen of Love her warrior }
While the first does horn
The stars of the morn,
And the next the heavenly farrier.
And the other five form the first five lines of the
first stanza, and the whole of the third and fourth
stanzas, in this piece of brilliant workmanship.
TOM O’ BEDLAM'S SONG.
From the hag and hungry goblin
That into rags would rend ye,
All the spirits that stand
By the naked man,
In the book of moons, defend ye.
Beware of the black rider
Through blasted dreams borne nightly j
From Venus Queen
Saved may you bin,
And the dead that die unrightly.
With a wench of wanton beauties
I came unto this ailing :
Her breast was strewn
Like the half o’ the moon
With a cloud of gliding veiling.
In her snow-beds to couch me
I had so white a yearning,
Like a moon-struck man
Her pale breast ’gan
To set my wits a-turning.
I know more than Apollo ;
For oft, when he lies sleeping,
I behold the stars
At mortal wars,
And the rounded welkin weeping.
The moon’s my constant mistress
Aud the lovely owl my marrow ;
The flaming drake
And the night-crow make
Me music, to my sorrow.
With a heart of furious fancies,
Whereof I am commander ;
With a burning spear
And a horse of air,
To the wilderness I wander :
With a knight of ghosts and shadow*
I summoned am to tourney,
Ten leagues beyond
The wide world’s end ;
Methinks it is no journey!
The shadows plot against me,
Aud lie in ambush for me $
The stars conspire,
And a net of tire
Have set for my farings o’er mat
I ride by ways that are not
With a trumpet sounding to me
From goblin lists,
And the maws of mists
Are opened to undo me.
Hate, Terror, Lust, and Frenzy
Look in on mtj with faces ;
And monstrous haunch
And toad-blown paunch
Do show me loathed disgraces.
1 hear on imminent cities
The league-long watches arm&d,
Dead cities lost
Ere the moon grew a ghost,
Phantasmal, viewless, charmed.
With sights I, seeing, see not,
The air is all a-bustle ;
Draughty with wings
And seething things
That without sound do rustle.
It is not light nor darkness
In that place which is placeless:
With honor of doom
Drift by like fume
Faces that arc most faceless.
As a burst and blood-blown insect
Gleaves to the wall it dies on,
The smeared sun
Doth clot upon
A heaven without horizon.
I dare nob bub be dreadless,
Because all things to dread are;
With a trumpet blown
Through the mists alone
From a land where the lists of the dead are.
Francis Thompson.
• • * *
To the writer’s mind, that performance fixes
Francis Thompson’s place as poet more than any-
thing else he has written. (Hitherto he has been
all a-ferment with fancies and phrases : like the
alchemist’s crucible just before the gold-birth,
with red fumes rising, and strange odours, and a
dazzling gleam caught by moments through the
bubble and seethe.) One would not have thought
it possible to breathe so easily in the Bedlam
atmosphere : word and sense, the reinforcement
is perfect : it is indistinguishable from the ori-
ginal. And the original is a crazy splendid ghost
that haunts fit minds unexorcisably.
* * • *
Thompson’s feat needed a poet: Kipling, with
all his craftsmanship, could not accomplish it.
That second stanza required a forcible projection
of the imagination into the unknown-; and Kip-
ling’s forte is fact, and the highly-skilled com-
mentary on fact: it is his lack of imagination
which (to anyone trained in good verses) so ob-
viously limits his sphere. Within his bounds
Kipling’s cleverness is as remarkable as Thomp-
son’s ; but Thompson overpasses the bounds.
Kipling’s last bib of magazine verse, by the way—
“The Destroyers”—is hard and mechanical,
despite neab construction and an occasional
dexterous epithet. This—applied to torpedo-
boats—is photography : a picture well composed
and focussed, bub photography merely, lacking
essential creative art.
The strength of twice three thousand horse
That seek the single goal—
The line that holds the signalled course,
The hate that swings the whole :
The stripped hulls, slinking through the gloom.
Half-guessed and gone again—
The brides of Death that wait the groom—
The Choosers of the Slain !
* » * •
Follows the single good item in Henry Newbolt’B
pamphlet of ballads, “ Admirals All,” whose
appeal to English pride and prejudice has been
rewarded by the sale of a dozen editions. Bub
there are three or four pretty fair items—and
three or four entirely worthless. At his besb,
Newbolt has a swing and an emotion ; and ha
takes credit for being independent of Kipling.
DRAKE’S DRUM.
Drake, he’s in his hammock an’ a thousand mile
away,
(Capten, art tha sleepin’ there below ?)
Slung atween the round shot in Nombre Dios
Bay,
An’ dreamin’ arl the time o’ Plymouth Hoe.
Yarnder lumes the island, yarnder lie the ships,
Wi’ sailor lads a-dancin’ heel-an-toe,
An’ the shore-lights flashin’, an’ the night-tide
dashin’,
He sees et arl so plainly as he saw et long ago.
Drake he was a Devon man, an’ ruled the Devon
seas,
(Oapben, at t tha sleepin’ there below ?),
Bovin’ tho’ his death fell, he went wi’ heart at
ease,
An’ dreamin’ arl the time o’ Plymouth Hoe.
“ Take my drum to England, hang et by the
shore,
Strike et when your powder’8 runnin’ low }
If the Dons sight Devon, I’ll quit the port o’
Heaven,
An’ drum them up the Channel as we drummed
them long ago.”
Drake he’s in his hammock till the great Armadas
come,
(Capten, art tha sleepin’ there below 1)
Slung atween the round shot, listenin’ for the
drum,
An’ dreamin’ arl the time o’ Plymouth Hoe.
Call him on the deep sea, call him up the Sound,
Call him when ye sail to meet the foe ;
Where the old trade’s flyin’ an’ the old flag flyin’,
They shall find him ware an’ wakin’, as they
found him long ago !
Henry Newbolt.
• * * *
Since Newbolt’s success he has contributed
freely to the magazines, and he is soon to publish
an enlarged book. Both he and Le Gallienne
wrote war verses for the American magazines :
Newbolt’s were not good, but they were easily
better. Le Gallienne is said to have been ap-
pointed Professor of English Literature in the
advertising University being established by the
proprietor of Cosmopolitan magazine. The death
of Eric Mack ay adds to the trouble of the
Corellian household. The redoubtable Marie
(Eric’s wife, according to a Bulletin contributor)
has been libelled as an author who cannot be
taken seriously, and has been taken seriously ill.
Eric Mackay was 47 ; and poetically his father
was worth two of him. His talent lay in cover-
ing the commonplace with flowery verbiage, in
the manner of those useful ladies who turn
old boots into ornaments with gold paint and
ribbons. But one feels safe in saying that not an
Original idea or vivid emotion can be found in all
his tangle of spun words. Erie Mackay’s^com-
mon-place admirers praise especially his “ Bee-
thoven at the Piano,” which especially justifies
this opinion, and which contains the interesting
lines—
Ah angel by direct descent, a German by alliance,
Thou didst intone the wonder-chords which made
despair a science.
Yea, thou didst strike so grand a note that, in its
large vibration,
It seemed the roaring of the sea in Nature’s
jubilation.
That is typical Eric Mackay. Charles Mackay
was commonplace, too, but at best there was a
heart-beat to him, he was vital. In his son the
Nile is lost in wastes of sandy phrases.
* * * *
Local writers are rather torpid, waiting the
surge of Spring. Daley, whose book has been
cordially welcomed, is meditating a promising
poem or two. has been ill with a recurrence
of lung trouble, and has been medically ordered
to the dry interior. Brady, whose fine sea-ballads
The Bulletin is preparing for book-publication,
has also been ill with overwork, but is now, his
friends gladly hear, on the road to recovery.
Arthur Adams is busy on a comic opera to eclipse
“Hinemoa”; and Ogilvie, whose book, “Fair
Girls and Gray Horses,” is now well advanced, has
contributed several pleasant items lately. Pater-
son is still reported as engaged on his novel; ana
Lawson, who contemplates a visit to England
next year, wishes first to publish in Australia a
second book of verses. Kenna has written little
verse lately ; but is developing good capacity as a
psychological-story-writer. Those are all one
thinks of except Brunton Stephens, our
“father and master” as Premier Byrnes
calls him, who has the energy of three
of the younger men put together, and is busy on
important work which will see light in good time.
Just at present the time is postponed by official
promotion (B.S. is Q. Chief Secretary’s. chief
clerk), which brings much official labor in its
train, Anu Chris. Brennan, who has an air of
holding up in Australia the banner of the French
symbolists, is making new verse-steps “ Towards
the Source ” —and sends this small piece, un-
titled —
The N.S. W. School Libraries, instituted by Mr.
J. Kevin, now number between 90 and 100 in the Lithgow
district, and as many in Duntrog district. Mr. Kevin
raised a voluntary £6OO at Lithgovv, and gave the children
nearly 7000 volumes—not goody-goodies, but literature of
a strong masculine stamp—biography, voyage and travel,
discovery, moral stories, novels, poetry, and elementary
science. The Dungog libraries, opened little more than
two years ago, have a total of between 8000 and 9000 hooks.
Scores of similar libraries have been, and are being, estab-
lished in other districts. And Government has not assisted
the movement in any way: it is due entirely to the en-
thusiasm of individuals.
M. Dubout’s play was unfavourably criticised
in the Revue des Dem Mondes, and M. Dubout was
refused space to reply. So he brought legal action, and
the French Appeal Court decides that any person
attacked in print has the right of reply—or cash com-
pensation. At latest the Rivue had appealed against the
appeal.
The proper place of Robert Hichens’ “The
Londoners” is on the stage as a farcical comedy: the
broad humor grows tiresome in a novel. Quote: “In his
hands the commonest actions assumed the dignity of
feats. In his mouth the most ordinary remarks took on
an aspeot of Mount Sinai.”
In “The Disaster’’ Paul and Victor Mar-
gueritte imitate Zola’s “La ; their subject is
the downfall of Bazaine’s army of the Rhine. But even
Zola’s synthetic power is often beaten by his facts ; and
their facts 'always beat the Marguerittes. The quasi-
romantic relation of the causes of Metz is so dull that one
has not strength to reach the capitulation. The book, in
fact, is another example of a publisher’s pleasant little
way of guessing a public want, procuring a book to suit,
and booming it per ardua advts. ad alta sales.
Hermes : The frequency of Bulletin references
is establishing a popular impression that Sydney Public
Library consists wholly of Burton’s “Arabian Nights.”
I trust that the following authentic notes will intensify
that excellent impression. To wit: When a lady calls
for Burton’s “Nights” the gentle attendant promptly
brings her Lane’s highly expurgated translation —three
nicely printed volumes with hundreds of beautiful wood-
cuts of gorgeous architecture and wondrous landscape,
The difference is that between lemonade and vitriol. If
the lady, rejecting the nice print and delicate wood-cuts,
sternly insists upon Burton, the attendant mentally cal-
culates if she is 21. If he thinks not, he point-blank re-
fuses to help her to sin. If she is, he goes sadly away,
washes his hands, takes in the wicked volume softly, and
darts away to hide his blushes. It was long ago, before
Burton’s edition became popular, thin a sweet young
thing wandered in one hot afternoon and languidly asked
how many volumes there were. “ Sixteen! ” replied the
dismayed attendant. “Oh, well! fetch me the first
three,” said the languid lady, drawing off her gloves and
exposing her wedding ring. Tie attendant’s knees
smote together, and his side muscles shook. “But —er
—it’s —ah —immoral 1” he gasped. “Oh !Is it very im-
moral?’’ “Very!” he said. “Well, then, fetcli me the
whole sixteen,” replied the lady eagerly.
She listens by the sources
where olden quiet lies
unto the silent forces
where the bound depths are wise
They tell her of their knowing
—and knows she what they tell?
The lithe ways of her going
dumbly declare it well
We deem her child whose bliss 13
to weave a winsome wile
we give her smiles and kisses
—O strange, that she should smile!

MAN !
Will you allow yourself to fall into
this miserable state of Nervous Debility
when a Cure is at hand ?
THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER. —A man who has lost his will-power, by continually
committing- himself to those habits of dissipation or abuse that unfit him for nearly all the walks of
life, should, without delay, consult these eminent Specialists. Now, the experience of 20,000 men
overcame the delicate feelings to such an extent that they have openly endorsed the treatment of

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or .soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
! day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59
other leading residents.
Prepared only and sold wholesale and retail by the pro-
prietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I shouid say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation,”

Moths.
Msths around the candle,
Grey and dappled grey ;
You silly things with fragile wings,
Away, away, away!
Into the gloom they fluttered ;
Out of the gloom they came ;
And one fell dead on a page that said,
“And he gave his life for Fame.”
Moths from the old red roses
They wheeled about above ;
And a poet sighed for a maid that died :
“All for the sake of Love ! ”
Moths from the walnut wardrobe
Where silks lie fold on fold ;
The way of to-day is the old, old way,
And “ We die and are damned for gold.”
Moths from the crystal clusters
That swoon on the green grape-vine,
And, “ Sirs, fill up the flowing cup,”
And “ There is no god like Wine.”
Moths around the candle
Ye tire me with your rout;
Enough, enough, one little puff,
And at least your candle’s out !
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Modern Story.
Once on a time, as Love was sweeping
Across a bustling city street,
He heard below a sound of weeping
Among the tramp of thousand feet.
He saw a heart so sore and mangled
That he forgot his prudent care ;
And, ere he knew, he was entangled
In countless strands of golden hair.
And merrily the maiden carried
Her captive to a hidden spot;
But mankind went its way, and married
And smiled and kissed, and troubled not.
Long years went by, until the maiden
Had grown into a woman sweet,
With drooping lips, and sorrow-laden,
Though half the world was at her feet!
For all that Love can claim was offered
In lavish bounty at her door.
But all that Love endures she suffered,
And she could bear her lot no more.
Sick with the aftertaste of pleasure,
Of broken vow and spoken lie,
With burning eyes she took her treasure
And sold him to a passer-by.
They kept him in a prison tainted
By flaunting shame and sullied trust,
Where, prison-fed and coarsely painted,
They leased him out to vice and last.
Amid the offal and the shoddy,
Beneath the glare of revels grim,
Upon their foulest victim’s body
They crucified, they murdered him !
But still—and this is just the story —
The world caressed and laughed and wed ;
Men never missed their crown of glory ;
Men never knew that Love was dead.
Q.
VON KOTZE.
Tempted.
Cheek of damask, lip of crimson,
Breath of flowers, throat of snow,
Eyes, deep lakes the starlight swims in
To the softer dusk below —
Temptress fair ! ’tis more than laughter
Such sweet lips should tremble after ;
’Tis no thought demure and wise
Lights those torches in your eyes.
Temptress ! did you learn that blush in
Rigid Virtue’s solemn rules?
Face on fire against the cushion—
Is it taught in saintly schools ?
Temptress, temptress tantalising,
Flushed and fluttered and enticing,
On your own heart’s wish have ruth ;
I and Cupid know the truth !
Hands were made for hands to hold them.
Cheeks were softened cheeks to press,
Lips were left for lips to mould them
To a pouting tenderness ;
You were fashioned for fruition,
Not a prudent moral mission;
Sigh denial as you will,
Love flaunts rosy signals still.
Temptress, dear ! I mock your chiding:
In your veins and mine at once
Cytherea’s cars are riding
With their winged postillions.
Temptress ! —by your pulse’s quiver;
Temptress ! —by your lashes’ quiver;
Temptress, temptress ! Don’t protest:
I and Eros know you best !

PREMIER REID’S UNDELIVERED SPEECH .-ILLUSTRATED BY
“ HOP.”
The Bulletin
Registered at the General Post Office, Sydney , for Transmission by Post as a Newspaper.
Vol. 19.—N0. 962.
SATURDAY, JULY 23, 1898.
Prick, 6d.
To the Electors of King Division.
The following is the unpublished and un-
delivered address of Premier George H.
Reid to the electors of King division,
Sydney. The Bulletin has been waiting
to hear Reid deliver it, but at last its
patience has given out, so it puts on an
eye-glass, and takes a large chew of toffee
these accessories are required to “ make-up”
the character, in the language of the stage—
and delivers the address itself:
To The Electors op King Division. —
Gentlemen : I appear before you for themanyth
time. In 1887, when this electorate was called
"I appear before you.”
East Sydney and had four members, you kindly
put me second on the poll (below Burdekin)
with 4108 votes—2262 votes ahead of the de-
feated candidate. By 1891 my popularity had
so far increased that I just got in as the last of
the four members, being badly licked by
M'Millan, Barton and Varney Parkes. I
got 2946 votes, and was just 686 ahead of the
defeated candidate. In 1894, when the King
was a single electorate, I got 819 votes, and
had a majority of 469. In 1895, I had 610
votes, and scraped in by a majority of only
132. I represent 610 out of 2174 electors.
This isn’t why I believe in majority-rule as
applied to Federation.

measures were the Navigation Bill and the

them. It also threw out my Stamp and Pro-

that I am going to fight this election also on
the question of Council Reform, and (2) that I
have a great esteem for the unreformed Coun-
cil, and am going to carefully preserve the
nominee principle.
I promised at the late lamented Jubilee that
I wouldn’t go to England
or take a title. Naturally
I did both.

I am the author of the
famous £333,000 surplus of
1896. The published Govern-
ment Statistics show a defi-
cit of £448,000 that year,
but my surplus was quite
legal, for I passed a law
by which nearly £BOO,OOO

ture at all. If I had passed

a bigger law I could have made the surplus
.£3,000,000 instead of .£333,000.
The accumulated deficit is just about where
I found it. Also, I have just finished the
biggest year’s borrowing
since ’9l, and the big-
gest year’s loan expendi-
ture since ’93.
I was a bitter provin-
cialist till 1894, when it
became necessary to dish

I turned Federationist,

ever since. Any one who

that it is they who are intensely anxious to
federate with us from the lowest and most
mercenary motives. This sort of thing keeps
the Federal spirit alive. Jack Want didn’t
call the other provinces “wolves.” I heard
him do it.
I agreed to the insertion of the 50,000 mini-
mum in the Enabling Bill, just to give Pro-
vincialism a good start. When it was proposed
to increase the minimum I suggested 80,000,
and said I would accept it, and voted partly
for it and partly against it. If I had wanted
to keep faith with the other provinces, and had
made it a Government question, and had told
my party to vote against the 80,000 minimum,
of course it would have been defeated ; but I
didn’t. lam an unusual kind of Premier, and
you never know what I am going to do.
When the Federal Bill was before the Council
my esteemed colleague, Jack Want, declared
that he was a provincialist, and the “arch-
destroying angel of Federation.” Also he de-
scribed Federation as “ a hydra-headed monster
basking in its constitu-
tionalbeastliness in this
bright and sunny land.”
I have taken Mr. Want
back into the Ministry
as a guarantee of our
joint sincerity in seek-
ing Federation. We
make a really beautiful
pair —we do indeed.
Hooray !
* * *
At the Federal Con-
vention I voted for the
three-fifths majority on
a joint sitting of the
two Houses (it was my
valued colleague, Car-
ruthers, who proposed
it), for equal represen-
tation of the States in
the Senate, and for leav-
ing the division of the

wig in a soft place.
surplus to the Federal .
Parliament. I didn’t even call for a division
on the bounties question, or on the right of the
Senate to suggest amendments in money bills.
I voted against federating the debts and rail-
ways, and I didn’t once ask for a guarantee of
the territorial integrity of the States.
Now, I am against equal State representation
in the Senate, against the three-fifths majority,
the bounties arrangement, the power of the
Senate to suggest amendments in money bills,
and the leaving of the division of the surplus
to the Federal Parliament. Also, I demand a
guarantee of the territorial integrity of the
States, and I leant to federate the debts and
railways. In fact, I am against every im-
portant point that I supported, and I am howl-
ing for everything that I previously denounced.
Since writing the above I have begun to wobble
again, and I don’t really know whether I want
to federate the debts and the railways or not.
As I have beautifully expressed it, “ the last
word has not yet been spoken” with regard to
the financial arrangements. Therefore my
Federal amendment proposals are as clear as
mud. That is why I jeer at Barton for not
making his Federal programme more definite.
* • * *
When I came back from the Convention I
at once started to denounce the Bill because of
the things I had done my level best to put in
it, and because of its lack of the things I had
helped to keep out. I told the people to vote
against it. I voted for it my-
self. lam built that way.
I am a quaint and remark-
able person all round.
There were 72.000 votes for
the Bill and 66,000 against
it, but by reason of the 80,000
minimum, which I cordially
accepted and voted sometimes
for and sometimes against,
the minority wins. That is
why I am now hollering for
majority rule. When this
discrepancy is pointed out I
simply say that 7*,000 isn’t
a majority of the 295,000
electors. The 610 voters who

return me for King Division aren’t a majority
of the 2174 electors either, but that is quite
a different thing.
My friend and colleague, Jack Want, an-
nounced, before the Federal vote was taken,
that, if the Bill was carried, he would still do
his uttermost to block it in Parliament here
and also'in England. In fact, he was going to
damn the majority. He also
hollers for majority-rule now.
• * •
I am particularly strong
now in demanding that the
Referendum shall be inserted
in the Bill. When Wise pro-
posed the Referendum in the
Convention, I voted against
it. Wise is a beastly Aus-
tralian native.
When the Bill was lost,

General’s gy-
rations.
on account of my 80,000
minimum, I, on behalf of the minority, and
in the name of majority-rule, asked Turner,
Braddon and Kingston to hold a Conference at
once, before the New South Wales general
election came off, to consider amendments.
Braddon refused, which conduct I have since
denounced as discourteous. I called Braddon
a lunatic, or something like that, at the Gon-
vention. That wasn’t discourteous. Besides,
he is a refined, frail, grey-headed old gentle-
man in bad health. Kingston also refused. I
didn’t call him any bad names in the Conven-
tion. He is a large, healthy, middle-aged per-
son who loves fighting, and he has a very short
temper. T i j
Turner agreed to the Conference I asked
for, but I took all manner of care that he
didn’t get it. He also asked what amendments
I wanted, but I refused to supply them.
Turner is a beastly lawyer. lam also a
lawyer.
By this arrangement I showed my sweet
reasonableness in asking for a Conference, and
the man who agreed to confer and the people
who didn’t agree to confer were equally left. I
have since denounced Turner for his lack of
sincerity. The fact that I promised to furnish
my list of proposed amendments was sufficient
reason for not doing it. And the fact that I
demanded the Conference before the general
election fully explains why the election is here
now and the Conference isn’t.

When Barton was Attorney-General and
tried to put a Federation Bill through Parlia-
ment Want and I both opposed him. That is
why I now sling mud at Barton and accuse
him of making no attempt whatever to help on
Federation.
When Barton decided to contest Bourke he
showed himself a coward for running away
from Sydney. I challenged any of the Federal
leaders to meet me in King Division, and
Barton, much to my surprise and disgust,
accepted the challenge. That also shows that
I never expected YOU!
he is a coward—for running
away from Bourke. I don’t
want to fight big Barton.
I only wanted to fight little
Tom Slattery.
Barton wants to reform
the New South Wales
Council by making it an
elective paid body with no
property qualification and
based on manhood suffrage
—just like the proposed
Federal Senate. Thatproves
him to be a wretched Con-
servative. I propose to
keep it an unpaid House
of Nominees. That shows
that I am the only genuine
Liberal now on the market.
The other reasons why I am a Liberal are
that I voted against the Referendum at the
Convention, and against the rule of the
majority in the joint Federal House, and in
favor of giving Tasmania, with 170,000 people,
the same voice in the Senate as New South
Wales with 1,300,000. Also, I dropped the
State Bank and State note-issue and other
things for the same reason. Another proof of
my Liberalism is that I hold a 66,000 anti-
Federal minority should boss a 72,000 Federal
majority.
* * * *
With regard to purely New South Wales
politics, I promise Local Government and a few
other things, just as I did before, and mv pro-
mise is just as valuable as it was then. lam a
strong believer in the Referendum, which is the
reason why I broke my promise to have one on
the fiscal question. And lam the same reliable
Freetrader as of old, in consequence of which
I am going to protect the sugar duty and I
levy £1,300,000 per head in Customs duties —a
larger sum in proportion to population than is
levied in such Protectionist countries as France
or Germany, and nearly twice as much per
head as is levied in the United States.
I am the head of a just and GoD-fearing
Government. My Government is a whale for
justice. That is why we refuse Suffield a
hearing, despite the strongest doubts as to the
fairness of his conviction.
Lastly, I have assured you that if you re-elect
me you will find me the Same Old George. In
other words, the same old Shuffler ; the same
old No-Yes ; same old Janus and Facing-Both-
Ways; same old two-headed curiosity on a

fence. And, under these conditions, I present
you with my amended Federal programme
(which I haven’t submitted to the other pro-
vinces, lest they should reply that they aren’t
having any, and then I couldn’t very well go
to the country on it) ; also my choice assort-
ment of broken promises. My other six or
eight amended Federal programmes will be
out shortly. If you re-elect me I don’t
know exactly what I will do, for I never
have known ; I have merely wobbled on the
spur of the moment. But at least you will find
me a fearless administrator, just as I was when
I let the Council reject my Probate Duties Bill,
and destroy all the good points in my Navigation
Bill and Shops and Factories Bill, after which
I didn’t demolish the Council, but grovelled
to it, and promised to preserve its nominee
character intact. Therefore I look back on my
steadily-diminishing majority of past years, and
wobble before you with confidence. And my
confidence is just the same kind of thing as my
old promise to abolish the unemployed in 24
hours, and my fiscal Referendum, and the other
things,
Here endeth (for want of space—not want

SATURDAY, JULY 23, 1898.
To the Electors of New South Wales.
The coining election in New South Wales is
not a mere local affair ; it is a matter which
concerns Australia in general. The whole
question of the making or unmaking of an
Australian nation may hang on the issue.
Last month, South Australia, Tasmania, and
Victoria decided in favor of Federation.
New South Wales also gave it a majority,
and 22,000 votes over and above the mini-
mum which was agreed upon when the Con-
vention was elected, and when the other pro-
vinces went into the movement on New
South Wales’s invitation. But, owing to a
curious law passed by certain M’s.L.A., who
themselves represent only a small minority
of the electors, the said majority is of no
account. There were 72,000 voters for the
on d I<3SS t ' lan 67,000 against it, and
too,ooo who didn’t vote, and, consequently,
d.dn t count. At least, they never count
at i aihamentary elections, for even Premier
Beid himself only represents 610 voters out
ot over 2100, and they never count at Par-
liamentary divisions, so it is fair enough to
assume that they dori’t count this time
ei ler. (If they do count, the only fair way
is to assume that the people who didn’t
vo e weie divided in the same pro-
portions as those who did.) Therefore, the
province is tied in a hard knot, and the
object of the present election is to untie it
somehow. -J.'he 72,000 voters who were for
the Bill can't have their way Because they.'
were not the required 80,000. The 06,000
odd aninßillious have a great deal less right
to have their way; if a majority isn’t
allowed to win it is utterly ridiculous that a
minority should do so. The unutterable
foolishness of having any minimum at all
protrudes conspicuously here ; if it was con-
sidered necessary to make unusually dead
sure of the feeling of the province on the
matter the one sensible way of doing it was
to make voting compulsory. And the un-
utterable foolishness of the anti-Billious
crowd who created that minimum glares
forth like the bleached skeleton of some-
body's reputation spread out in the dry
wilderness where the dead reputations lie.
* * * *
There is no fiscal issue in the question
this time; that weary object is away re-
cuperating. If Reid is Premier in next
Parliament he promises to stick to Free-
trade and protect the sugar industry with
heavy duties. If Barton is Premier he
pledges himself to let the present tariff re-
main untouched, but to do his best to create
a Federal Legislature which will take over
the whole fiscal controversy. Both men go to
the country on the Federal ticket. It is solely
a question between Reid, who represented
the minority on June 3, and who came a bad
second at the Convention election, and
who is responsible for the Act which
nullified majority rule; and Barton,
who came first at the Convention elec-
tion and who represented the majority at
the Referendum. Both men acknowledge
that the Bill which was thrown out by a
minority on that date wasn’t perfect—noth-
ing is perfect in this world. Both admit that
it would be the better of repairs and improve-
ments—everything in this world would be
the better of repairs and improvements. The
difference is that Reid represents the
minority’s idea of amendment, while Barton
represents the ideas of the majority. The
other difference between them is that the
Reid party says it will get certain altera-
tions—which is a crude and stupid lie de-
signed for no purpose except to catch votes,
for five or four or three, or even two, inde-
pendent provinces can’t federate except on
terms agreeable to all of them, and theREiD-
Want crowd won’t exact a fraction more in
the way of concessions than the other pro-
vinces choose to give. The Barton party, on
the other hand, says it will get any improve-
ments it can (and that is all that any party
can do), and then submit the question
afresh to the New South Wales electors and
let them decide whether the bargain is good
enough. There is not such a wild shriek of
red and green gorgeousness about that state-
ment, but it is true. All the yell about the
concessions which the Reid-Want party is
going to “demand” in the name of the
Federal minority is gas and bunkum ; for
all the power New South Wales has of en-
forcing its “ demands ” against even the fly-
speck of Tasmania it nrght as well heave
them at the Russian empire, and draw up
Majah Neild in a hollow square of one man
by way of enforcing them.
• * * *
The theory that New South Wales is to
call on the other provinces with a club and
exact concessions is based on a wild idea
that the other provinces are, in some way,
to make a large profit out of New South
Wales. And the theory won’t bear inspec-
tion. Victoria wants free access to New
South Wales markets, and while Freetrade
lasts in New South Wales it has that already.
It wants new railways built without regard
for provincial boundaries, so that the trade
of all the regions for which Melbourne is the
natural outlet shall go to Melbourne ; but
neither the present Bill nor Reid’s proposed
amendments grant that. It doesn't parti-
cularly want to combine its debt with that
of New South Wales, for it has much the
smaller debt of the two, and Reid proposes
that they should combine. It wants to have
an equal share of the Murray, but that
isn’t in the Bill. South Australia also
has the free run of the New ■ South
Wales markets already. It also wants
a F ederal policy of railway construc-
tion so that the trade of those districts for
which Adelaide is the most convenient port
may go there, but no such thing is offered to
it. It wants some guarantee that New South
Wales won't destroy its one river by using
all the upper waters for irrigation purposes,
and that Premier Reid proposes to expli-
citly refuse. South Australia, Victoria, and
Tasmania are all to pay the same taxes as
New South Wales, and to give New South
Wales free access to their markets, which at
present it hasn't got, and it is also proposed
that, in the gamble for the big prize of the
I ederal, capital they should be left entirely
out. There is plenty of reason why South
Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania should
want to federate with each other, because
each wants the run of the other’s markets,
now guarded by heavy tariffs. But New
South Wales has no such concession to
offer, because it has given it away already.
The extra age and size and wealth of New
South Wales don’t affect the question, be-
cause it proposes to keep its size and its
wealth, w hile its age is of no use to anyone
save the owner. Therefore, the Reid-
party, when it promises
°n its own aggressive' hook to secure
certain alterations in the Bill,* and
to secure Federation along With them,
is only a loud-mouthed fraud cadging
after votes, and whoever votes'for it because
.it promises on its own responsibility to get
an amended Federation is a fool, and might
as well vote for it because ib-ptomised to-get
the United States. Even the loudest-mouthed
roarer in politics can only enter into a part-
nership on such terms as the other parties to
the transaction think worth while.
* * « *
J he people have to choose in this matter
bet ween Reid and Barton. They are almost
equal on fiscal grounds ; the only difference
is that Barton’s promise to sink the fiscal
issue is worth any promise by Wriggler Reid
many times over. Behind Barton are Bruce
Smith, Wise, and R. E. O’Connor —three
names that have always been kept clean and
in good repute. Behind Reid, the Tory of
many broken promises who now whoops for
the retention of the nominee Chamber, are
foolish old Brunker, who told the public
the dismal cram that a 27 per cent, tariff
meant £27 taken out of every £lOO of every-
body’s earnings ; Ghould, the bloodless
lawyer who refuses Sdefield a hearing, but
practically offers to let him sneak out of
prison quietly if he will beg for mercy in-
stead of for justice ; Carruthers, the
author of the three-fifths majority clause
which he now denounces ; Sydney Smith,
who helped to wreck Federation by his wild
fiction that the Victorian bounties were to
be charged to the Commonwealth ; and
Want, who calls himself a Federalist and
says also that he is the “arch-destroying
angel of Federation.” Barton represents
the 72,000 majority; Reid demands his
alterations in the name of the 67,000
minority. But, above all things, the Barton
party calls for respect because it promises
what it can perform—that it will make the
best bargain it can with the other provinces
in the interests of New South Wales, and
then leave it to the people of New South
Wales to decide whether the bargain is good
enough to finally accept. And the Reid
party promises what it can’t perform, for no
one province can federate by itself, or make
or vary the federal compact by itself.
* * * *
For these reasons, and for many more.
New South Wales should support Barton,
and every candidate of the Barton party, at
the approaching election. As regards Reid’s
promise to find work for all the unemployed
when he gets back to power, there may be
no Reid left when that gorgeous P.N. comes
due, and if there is it will be the same Reid
who promised the same thing in ’95, and
with the same result. As regards the in-
numerable roads and bridges promised by
the supporters of the present Government,
the next Government will have as many
roads and bridges to give away as this one,
and it will have the same revenue to pay the
municipal subsidy out of, and the local mem-
ber will howl to it for the culvert just as he
howls to the one now in office. The people
who support any one Government for the
sake of iocal works are mostly a very great
ass, for the local works are always with us,
and, amid all political changes and variations
and comings and goings, the parish pump
assuredly asserts itself. But while that un-
obtrusive implement is invariably present,
the chance of making a new Australian
nation, with a continent and a history and
a future of its own, may come only once,
ihis is the only place in all the earth where
there is a chance to unite a whole continent
as one people—and the present obstacle is
the Reid Government, and the 67,000
minority which rules by virtue of the Reid
Government’s Act, and the provincial ani-
mosities which the Reid Government has
sedulously fanned, and the lies which certain
members of that Government and certain of
its supporters carefully circulated about
things which were never in the Federal Bill
at all, and the Government’s wobblings and
treachery and truculence and miserable in-
capacity. So it is time for New South
Wales to reject it and all its works.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Great Scott!!
Extract from N. S. W. Premier No-Yes Reid’s
speech at Paddington
Only about halt-a-dozen things required vitally alter-
ing. The first of these was the provision for deadlocks,
under whicli 38 representatives could defeat 56. (A
Voice : “ You voted for it.”) He did not, and those who
said so were trying to mislead the audience.—Daily
Telegraph, July 13.
There was, first, the question of the three-fifths
majority at the joint sitting. (“ You voted for it.”)
These gentlemen who s aid that knew perfectly well they
were imposing on that audience.— S.M. Herald, July 13.
Unless George Reid can prove that both these
papers made exactly the same mistake in re-
porting him, this narrows things down to the
alternative that either the official Hansard of
the Convention is a liar, or that Reid is lying
himself. On page 933 of the Convention Han-
sard (21st Sept., 1897) it is officially stated that
the three-fifths majority required to carry any-
thing at a joint sitting of the two Federal
Houses was first demanded by Reid’s own col-
league, Carruthers. According to that cold-
blooded record (page 932), Lyne moved to in-
sert in the Federal Bill
If, after a dissolution of both Houses of the Federal Par-
liament, as above provided, the subject matter of the
contention that led to such dual dissolution is again
passed by the Hou.se of Representatives, and again re-
jected by the Senate, such measure shall be referred to
the electors of the Commonwealth by means of a'National
Referendum, and, if resolved in the affirmative, shall be-
.come law.
Premier Turner (Vic.) and Wise (N.S.'W.)
moved, as an addition to this, that the two
Federal Houses should he dissolved simul-
taneously, instead of-one after the other, and
If, after such dissolution, the proposed law fails to pass,
-with or without amendment, the proposed law may be re-
ferred to the direct determination of the people as here-
inafter provided.
Therefore Turner, Wise, and Lyne stood up
as the advocates of the National Referendum.
And Reid’s valued colleague, Carruthers, got
on to his two valuable feet to demand.that the
Referendum be ignominiously “ chucked,’’ and
the three-fifths majority inserted in its stead.
His amendment (Hansard, page 933, 21st
Sept., ’97) reads :
To leave out “the direct determination of the people
as hereinafter provided ” with a view to add “ the mem-
bers of the.two Houses deliberating and voting together
thereon, and shall be adopted or rejected according: to
the decision of THREE-FIFTHS of the members present
and voting: on the question.
Premier Kingston, of S.A., promptly moved
to fire out the three-fifths majority and return
to the Referendum ; but the three-fifths majority
was supported by 30 votes against 11. Among
its supporters (page 967) were Barton,
Brunner, O’Connor, Walker, Carruthers,
and Premier George Reid, while Wise alone of
the N.S. W. contingent voted against it. Then
Turner, Deakin, and Higgins, all Victorians,
tried to fire out the three-fifths majority with
a view to enacting the democratic principle
that a bare majority should decide, and Reid’s
valued colleague, Carruthers, described them
as “wreckers.” On page 974 of the Conven-
tion Hansard (21st Sept., 1897) appears the
motion “ That the word ‘ three fifths ’ stand
part of the amendment.” It was carried by a
majority of 15, the said majority including
Barton, Brunker, M'Millan, O’Connor,
Walker, Carruthers, and G. H. Reid. Not
a single N.S. W. delegate voted against the
three-fifths majority this time. Then it was
finally moved that Carruthers’ three-fifths
majority idea be inserted in the Bill, and it
was inserted by 29 votes against 12, among the
29 being Barton, Brunker, O’Connor,
Walker, Carruthers, and G. H. Reid.
M'Millan’s was the only adverse vote from
N.S. W. And, unless S.M. Herald and Syd-
ney Telegraph have conspired to shamefully
misrepresent him, Reid solemnly alleges, in
the face of all these official records, that he
didn’t support the three-fifths majority. Bar-
ton supported it also, but then Barton didn’t
shuffle and prevaricate about it afterwards.
The Referendum was thrown out at Sydney on
the motion of Carruthers and with the sup-
port of Reid ; of the eleven supporters of the
Referendum (Convention Hansard, page 967,
21st September, 1897) Victoria supplied six,
S.A. three, W'estralia and N.S.W. one each.
Yet Jack Want, shrieking in the provincial
interest, told the N.S.W. people that the
Referendum was kicked out in Melbourne by
the “ wolves ” of the other provinces, in their
anxiety to take a mean advantage of the Corn-
stalk community ! and that slander has never
been withdrawn or apologised for to this day
+
Barton’s Record.
The election campaign speeches of Premier
Reid have mostly degenerated into furious
attacks on Barton for not securing Federation
while he was Attorney-General in the DibßS
Government. Yet when the circumstances are
fairly considered the record of the Dißfia
Government, bad as it was, doesn’t compare so
very badly with that of the one which followed
it. Each Government went into power to
establish it new fiscal system, and it did—so far,
they are about level. Each had one notable
Democratic reform on hand—the Dibbs Govern-
ment undertook to establish One-man-one-vote,
and did it j the Reid Government findettook
to reform the Upper House, and didn’t do it, el-
even attempt it. The Dibbs Government,
having its tinm largely taken up by the great
financial crisis" and by 13 votes of censure
moved by a certain office-hungry obstructionist
named Reid, didn’t manage to accomplish
Federation in its 34 months of office ; the Reid
Government, with no financial crisis on hand, and
with no hungry patriot always blocking busi-
ness with votes of, censure, hasn’t accomplished
Federation in 46 months. Barton, the Feder-
alist, coalesced with the Provincialist Dibbs, and
severed the connection when he found that he
could make no progress. Reid, the alleged Fede-
ralist, coalesced with the Provincialist Want,
and hugs him to his bingey to this day. Reid
is the boss man in the Ministry, so his chance
of accomplishing Federation has been vastly
better than that of Barton, who was only,
second man in the Dibbs Government. Despite
these disadvantages, Barton did get a Federa
tion Bill partly through Parliament, but it was
killed by the continued obstruction of the Op-
position-led by Reid. Reid got his Bill
through, partly, at least, because he was helped
instead of obstructed by the Opposition. Under
all these circumstances, Reid’s accusation of
treachery comes with very bad grace—especi-
ally when it is levelled by the boss Iscariot of
the movement at Australia’s most consistent
Federationist.
The “Blot.”
Edmund Barton, leader of the N:S.W.
Federal party, has declared, like most other
N.S.W. politicians, for the abolition of the
three-fifths majority in the Federal Consti-
tution Bill, and the elimination of the"'
“ Braddon Blot.” The Poor Old Blot seems
to have not a friend in the world ; and yet -
there is nothing the matter with it except the
utterly stupid lies that have been told concern-
ing it. It provides that not more than one-
fourth of the customs and excise revenue, if
there is any such revenue, shall be used for the
expenses of the Federal Government. There-
fore there may be a large Federal customs and
excise revenue, and the whole of the Federal
Government expenses be paid out of the fourth
or eighth or sixteenth part of it. Or there
may be a medium-sized Customs tariff, or a
small one, and the Federal Government may
pay part of its expenses out of the fourth of
the customs revenue which it is allowed to retain
if it feels so inclined, and the rest out of direct
taxation. Or there may be no customs tariff at
all, and the Federal Government may" pay all
its expenses out of- direct taxation. -. Or -there
may be a small,-or medium, or large customs
revenue, but. the Federal Government may not
take any of it for its own expenses. . The other
three-fourths, or as much more as the Govern-
ment pleases, of the customs and excise
revenue, if there is any,' are either to
be returned to the States to pay in-
terest on their debts with, or to be used by -
the Federal Government to pay interest on the
State debts ..when the Federal Government
takes them over. If there is no customs and
' excise revenue, or very little, then the States
get no refund, or a very sinall one, and the in-
terest on the public debt has to be paid wholly
or partly out of other sources. Premier Reid
truly stated at the beginning of his anti-Billious
campaign that the Braddon clause didn’t com-


mit the Federal Government to any fiscal
policy, and then he perpetrated the usual
wobble afterwards and said that it did. If a
similar clause, providing that not more than a
fourth of the N.S.W. customs and excise
revenue should be appropriated to cover the
cost of the State departments, and that the
other three-fourths should either be returned to
the taxpayers or should go towards paying
interest on the public debt, had existed
for the last dozen years in the N.S.W. Con-
stitution, it would have made no difference.
N.S.W., despite all its fiscal changes, has
been working on exactly these same lines all
the time without knowing it. Its famous G.
Reid is working on them now. It has about
£1,600,000 customs and excise revenue. It sets
aside three-fourths (£1,200,000) of this uncon-
sciously to pay interest, and makes up the
balance (about .£1,000,000) out of other sources
of revenue. It sets aside the other fourth
(£400,000) without knowing it to cover the
cost of Government, and makes up the balance
out of other sources of revenue without being
aware of the fact. If its tariff yielded
£3,000,000, or only £400,000, or only £1 per
annum, New South Wales would be still work-
ing on the Braddon Blot system, without
noticing the fact. Every other province, except
Westralia, is also working on the same system,
without knowing it, and has been for many
years. When the Federal Government takes
over the State debts, it will go on working on
the Braddon system without knowing it. The
Braddon Blot was a mistake simply because it
left things exactly where they would have been
if there had never been any Blot at all ; it was
doubtless meant to make a difference, but it
didn’t. It wasn’t worth putting in. It wasn’t
worth the slightest notice when it was in. And
it isn’t worth the trouble of taking out. It
makes just as little difference as a postage-stamp
pasted on Mount Kosciusko. It has certainly
proved a handy thing for the provincial crowd
to lie about, but, if it hadn’t been there, the
same crowd would have lied about something
else instead.

Government by Bounce.
When Premier Reid, the celebrated N.S.W.
Wobbler, re-opened the Federal question, after
the original Bill was defeated by a minority on
June 3, he asked the other Premiers for a Con-
ference and made three statements. They
were (1) that he wanted to confer with regard
to certain amendments ; (2) that a list of the
amendments would be submitted; (3) that he
wanted to have the Conference before the
N.S.W. general election so that he could take
the amended scheme to the country as part of
the Ministerial policy. Turner, of Victoria,
agreed to confer, but Reid’s promises were
promptly broken, as usual ; there was no Con-
ference, and the list of amendments was never
even submitted. In this matter Attorney-
General Want has risen to explain on behalf of
his chief :
They arranged, when he rejoined the Ministry, that
they would point out to the other provinces what were
the clauses which they considered were injurious to the
interests of N.S. Wales. This resulted in the adoption of
what has heen called a placard. Mr. Reid had been
blamed because he did not tell Sir George Turner
exactly what he wanted altered in the Bill. He (Mr.
Want) was not in the Ministry then, hut he could well
imagine that Mr. Reid was not such a fool as to state
what he wanted, because Sir George Turner would have
said: “There is one thing we cannot agree to.” . . .
The Government promised to have those things which
were injurious to N.S W., and N.S.W. only, altered ; they
would have it in black and white, and the other colonies,
seeing that we would insist on these amendments, would
give in. But Mr. Barton would negotiate—(laughter)—
negotiate—(renewed laughter) - negotiate (roars of
laughter). He was telling the other colonies, “I know
we can’t get them, hut you and I will have a chat, and
then I will come back to N.S.W. and tell them I tried to
get them but failed.”
This is a fine exposition of the bounceable atti-
tude of the great india-rubber Ministry. It
offered to negotiate with the other provinces.
It refused to negotiate with the principal of
them when its invitation was accepted. It
damns Barton because be is going to negotiate ;
yet when N.S. W. asks the other provinces to
come in and federate with it, it is obviously
necessary to negotiate the terms of the Federa-
tion. N.S.W. can’t federate all in a corner by
•itself. Though the Government promised to
state the amendments it wanted, it would,
according to Mr. Want, have been a fool to do
so, because Turner might have objected to one
of them. Possibly he would. In fact, he
probably will object to one or more, if he
doesn’t like them—just as Reid and Want
are objecting now. Apparently King Jack
thinks that Turner, or any other Pre-
mier, is not to be allowed to object to,any
of them ; but if the Reid Ministry is not going
to negotiate, and is not going to allow Turner
or anybody else to object to any of its terms,
and yet is going to federate, the only thing it
can do is to conquer the other provinces by force
of arms. It must either negotiate a union and
give the other provinces a say in fixing the terms,
or it must unite by conquest, or not unite at
all; and even the most insane variety of bully
Government is fully aware of this. Further,
King Cabbage-Tree alleges that the Reid Minis-
try would be a fool to let Turner know what
alterations it wants; and yet how it is going to
get alterations without letting the other parties
know what they are, the Lord only knows. And,
finally, the N.S.W. Government, according to
Mr. Want, promises to get certain alterations
made. It promises to get them without asking
the other partners whether it can get them or
not, and without knowing whether it can get
them or not, but with a view to obtaining votes
in the meantime it simply promises. Which
all makes up a fine blood-and-thunder attitude,
but this frantic stage-cursing means nothing
after all. For the Reid Government can’t
promise anything without the assent of the
other provinces—if it does promise, that fact
merely shows what an utterly unscrupulous
combination it is. And, if it comes back to
power, it will have to diminish its swelled head
and negotiate like anybody else. And it can’t
guarantee that the other provinces will give in ;
all it can say is that if N.S.W. doesn’t like the
terms which Reid or Barton gets, it needn’t
federate at all. If there is anything in its terms
that theother provinces cannot agree to, it will be
in exactly the same situation as any other Minis-
try which didn’t swell up and roar in this awful
fashion. Also, it will have to be exactly the
kind of fool that King Jack says it isn’t, and
explain what alterations it would like, just the
same as any other fool.

“The Bulletin’s” Mixed Correspondent.
A letter, from “ Mixed ” :
Dear Bulletin. —I ain a bit mixed as to how I shall
vote at the forthcoming election, and appeal to you to
put me on the straight and narrow track. I voted
against the Convention Bill because, in imagination, I
saw 38 Fatmen firing out a measure (say an Old Age
Pensions Bill) approved of by 56 Thinmen. And because
I prefer the Referendum to the 38 Fatmen, I am branded
a Provincialist, a gutter-snipe, and several other horrible
things. But calling me these hard names has not con-
vinced me that my vote was wrong. But, to make doubly'
sure next time, I submit my dillicnlty to you, and ask for
your guidance. The Bulletin has hall-marked B. R.
Wise with the stamp of its approval by recommending
him to the electors as a fit, and proper person to vote for.
Well, Wise at the Convention stigmatised the Referendum
as an appeal from the enlightened few to the ignorant
many, and what adds force to his remark is the fact that
the ignorant many sent him there, therefore he was
peculiarly qualified to correctly gauge and express an
opinion on the impenetrable density and utter awfulness
of popular ignorance. I am an ignorant-many person
myself, which possibly accounts for my belief in the
Referendum, but my belief is mostly founded on the
teachings of The Bulletin, and strengthened and con-
firmed by the published utterances of two Britishers—
who probably knew half as much as Wise named
Gladstone and Balfour, both of whom publicly ex-
pressed their approval of the principle. Well, this is my
difficulty. Suppose the intellectual and pure merino
Wise contests this constituency, and is opposed by John
Smith who advocates the Referendum, and won’t be happy
till he gets it, will The Bulletin kindly advise me which
candidate to vote for. Shall it be the enlightened B. R.
Wise and the 38 Fatmen, or plain John Smith and the
Referendum ?
The Bulletin is pleased to offer “Mixed”
some advice. (1) He began by assuming that
because the existing nominee or property-vote
Upper Houses are Tory, therefore everything
that is called an Upper House (even the pro-
posed Federal Senate with no property or
plural vote, no property qualification for mem-
bers, and with paid Senators elected on the
Democratic franchise of the existing provincial
Assemblies) must be Tory also. Therefore, he
was an Ass and had an asinine dream about 38
Fatmen and 56 Thinmen, when there was
hardly the ghost of a chance for any person of
Fat principles to get in at all. (2) “ Mixed ”
voted against the Federal Constitution, because
it hadn’t the Referendum in it, and the only
remedy for deadlocks was the joint sitting.
Well, the result is, that he remains under a
Constitution which contains neither. And
the Federal Legislature, with both Houses
elected by manhood suffrage, would have
been much more likely to grant the Referen-
dum than the provincial Tory Councils
are. (3) Wise didn’t advocate the principle
under which the 38 could outvote the 56. He
voted against it. Reid and Carruthers voted
for it. Also it was Carruthers’ inven-
tion. (4) Would The Bulletin vote for
John Smith rather than Wise, if John
Smith supported the Referendum ? Depends
on the kind of Smith. If a very weak John
Smith supported all The Bulletin’s ideas, but
was such an essentially dull and commonplace
individual that his support was not likely to
get them a bit further forward, and a very
strong and vigorous and eloquent Jones or
Wise supported half of them, and would prob-
ably be able to carry them into effect, then it
would support the latter. It is quite possible
for 100 well-meaning John Smiths to do no
good all put together. It is necessary to inspect
the imaginary John Smith before passing an
opinion. Also, to know if he is the kind of
Smith whose word is to be relied upon. For
instance, Parkes supported Local Government
for 25 years, and left it no further advanced
after all.
Financial Confusion.
A week ago, before he began to totter on his
basis again, Premier Reid suggested, in a tenta-
tive sort of way, that his idea of a proper settle-
ment of the Federal financial problem was that
the Central Government should take over the
State debts and railways in a mass. Sydney
Telegraph, which cordially supported Reid
and tried to make the best case it could for
him, decided that the result would be as
follows :
Debts Assets Debt not
transferred transferred represented
by States. by States. by assets.
N.S.W. ... £58,588,000 £43,321,000 £15,267,000
Victoria ... 47,029,000 41,245,000 5,784,000
Queensland 33,498,000 23,128,000 10,370,000
S.A. ... 24,414,000 15,221,000 9,193,000
Tasmania ... 7,882,000 4,180,000 3,702,000
£171,411,000 £127,095,000 £44,316,000
This means that at present N.S.W. has debt to
the amount of nearly £l2 per head with no
transferable assets to show for it; that Queens-
land, S.A. and Tasmania have from £2O to
.£25 per head; while Victoria has only £5 per
head of debt which isn’t represented by assets.
If the debts and railways were all lumped
together, however, the combined provinces
would have about £l2 per head of debt for
which there were no assets; in other words,
N.S.W. would remain just about where it is
now ; Queensland, Tasmania, and S.A. would
have their debt burden greatly reduced ; while
Victoria, instead of only owing £5 per head
over and above its assets, would find its debt
increased to over £l2 per head. The Telegraph
so far acknowledged the difficulty of the situa-
tion as to publish a suggestion that the Federal
Government should guarantee Victoria a sub-
sidy of £250,000 a year on the ground that it
handed over to the Commonwealth the smallest
proportion of liabilities and the largest propor-
tion of assets. But Premier Reid, so far as
he has gone, doesn’t propose any subsidy or any
compensation. Also he proposes to continue the
present system of provincial railway construc-
tion, so as to still force the Riverina trade to Syd-
ney, and prevent Victoria getting any indirect
compensation that way. And on top of all he
demands that N.S.W. shall have the Federal
capital, and, apparently, the control of the
Murray, and that Victoria shall help to guaran-
tee, under the proposed new territorial clause,
that the Riverina shall never be allowed to
secede from N.S.W. however much it wants to.
The proposed amendments are very good for
Queensland, S.A. and Tasmania, which would
get a huge reduction of their debt at Victoria’s
expense, in consideration of agreeing that
N.S.W. should have the capital and would be
guaranteed against any risk of secession as well;
bat Victoria will almost certainly jump on
them with all its feet. There are two possible
ways out of the difficulty. By far the better
of the two is for the Federal Government
to take over the debts and railways with
sole power to construct new lines, and all
differential rates to be abolished. The other is
to let the railway problem rest awhile and for
the Federal Government to secure the solvency
of the States meanwhile by taking over £4O per
head of the debt of each State. It couldn’t
equitably take over more than that, for the least
indebted State only owes £4O per head. But
the proposal of the N.S.W. Premier—if it is
definite enough to be called one—only makes
the financial confusion several times worse than
it w’as before.
—*.
The Pall in Wages.
From time to time we hear—and we almost grow sick unto
death of hearing it—that the policy of Freetrade as intro-
duced by Mr. Reid spells ruin and disaster to the manu-
facturing industries of the colony, but what does an in-
vestigation, a throwing aside of the veil, reveal ? The
factories of Anthony Hordern and Sons give the lie direct
to this assertion, and there is no firm in Australia, per-
haps, that goes in for manufacturing to such an extent,
and in so many different ways, as does this firm, which is
ever growing as it lives. . . . And the rub lies
in the fact that since the liberal policy of Mr. Reid
took shape wages have had a general tendency to in-
crease rather than diminish. (Probably, however, the
prodigiously prolific brain of the Protectionist will invent
a ready explanation in this regard.)—Sydney Telegraph,
July 6.
The Bulletin, speaking on behalf of the pro-
lific brain of the Protectionist, has the greatest
pleasure in explaining the general tendency of
wages to increase in N.S.W. under the Reid
policy. Its explanation is that they don’t in-
crease, but that instead they diminish regu-
larly and shamefully and ruinously. Its evi-
dence on this point is not the loose statements
said to have been made by any gentleman in
business (no gentleman in business could very
well give himself a bad advt. by saying that he
had reduced wages), but the annual official
statistics published by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Statistician. The following, according to
that official authority, are the minimum wages
paid in ’95 and in ’97 to the furniture-making
class—that being the big feature of the great
Hordern business:—
Minimum Minimum
wage, 1895 wage, 1897
Foremen £3 5 0 ... £2 10 0
Machinists 212 0 ... 17 6
Cabinet-makers 115 0 ... 112 0
Polishers 2 8 0 ... 2 0 0
Chair-makers 212 0 ... 19 0
Wood-turners 210 0 ... 116 0
Upholsterers 212 0 ... 2 0 0
Upholstresses 10 0 ... 012 6
Seamstresses 1 0 0 ... 0 9 0
Mount-cutters 116 0 ... 115 0
Girls 010 0 ... 0 5 0
Venetian-blind makers ... 210 0 ... 110 0
Do. painters ... 116 0 ... 15 0
Billiard-table makers ... 214 0 ... 2 0 0
Ivory-turners 3 0 0 ... 2 0 0
Packers 2 5 0 ... 012 0
Boys 0 8 0 ... 0 5 0
Hair and Flock Hands ... 115 0 ... 017 0
Against these there are two lines in the furni-
ture trade where, according to the official
State statistics, the minimum wage was higher in
1897, when the Reid policy had got a firm hold
on N.S.W., than in 1895 ; and four where the
minimum wage remained unchanged. And
this is just one trade, chosen nob because it
supports the Protectionist case better than
any other, but because it is specially instanced
by the insolent shoddy organ as a proof of
how the Reid policy has made wages go up.
In the clothing-trade cutters’ minimum wages
are quoted as having fallen from £2 10s. a week
in ’95 to £\ ss. in ’97 ; foremen’s from £3 to
£2 ; pressers, £2 to £1 ss. ; and so on.
There are 22 columns of such wage-statis-
tics in the N.S.W. Statistical Register,
and anyone who chooses to compare the figures
for 1895—the last year of the Protectionist tariff
—with those for 1897, can wade right through
them and find such results everywhere. That
is just where the prodigiously prolific brain of
the Protectionist comes in. These results may
or may not be produced by Freetrade, but that
isn’t the question. The matter at issue is that
the Freetrader denies that there are any such
results, and says that the absence of them is a
proof of the advantages of his policy. And the
Freetrader who says that is a broken idol, and
a Gehazi, and a weather-prophet, and a Tozer,
and an exploded paper-bag generally.
Gone Smash..
A first attempt at establishing the Referendum
in Victoria as a means of deciding differences
between the People’s House and the House of
48 Rich Landlords, came to grief as soon as it
gob started. The Government had a Bill on
hand for the purpose, but private member
Outtrim got his measure to the same effect in
first, so the Turner Ministry gave it the Minis-
terial vote and support. The second reading
was carried with a rush by 47 votes against 21.
But according to an ancient, decomposed pre-
cedent, which was dug up some time ago by the
48 Rich Landlords for the express purpose of
squashing Democratic legislation, any Bill
which amends the Constitution must he carried
by an absolute majority of both Houses, and in
the lamentable absence of six pledged sup-
porters of the measure—Trenwith, Vale,
Maloney, Salmon, Duggan and Baronet
O’Loghlen—there was one affirmative vote
short. So the Referendum Bill went down,
despite its big majority, through the neglect of
six men from whom their country expected
better things. The Government measure is
still to come on, but the House of 48 Rich
Landlords has dug up another old precedent,
even more decayed than the first one, to the
effect that a proposal for the reform of the Con-
stitution, once lost, can’t he revived again in
the same session. Old Nicholas Fitzgerald,
M.L.C., therefore informs the Government, on
behalf of the4B Rich Landlords, that if Outtrim’s
Referendum Bill had reached their Chamber it
would have been cast out, and if the Govern-
ment’s Referendum Bill gets there this session
it won’t be even considered, but simply ruled
out of order. The fine, old bloated Landlords
were in good form on this occasion. They
announced, per medium of Nicholas Fitz-
gerald, that they were quite willing to bow to
public opinion, if it is placed before them in a
form which “impresses” them, but, as the
Landlords have thrown out almost every Demo-
cratic measure which came before them, no
matter how large the popular majority which
backed it, they are evidently waiting for the
only kind of impression which will impress
them—that delivered by the people at the end
of a gun, or when they poke a long, red pole,
through the window with the head of Cor-
nelius Job Ham on the endof.it. Also, the
Council desired to intimate that it also repre-
sented the people—which it doesn’t. The people
elect the Vic. Councillors certainly, but when
they are only allowed to elect wealthy-landlords
(no other class being eligible) they have just as
free a choice as Nicholas Fitzgerald would
have if he had the option of voting for the
Referendum or the abolition of the Council,
and for nothing else. One thing seems tolerably
certain ; the bulk of the 48 Rich Landlords,
though they boast of having popular opinion
behind them, are too cowardly, and have too
little faith in the truth of their own statements,
to come out from behind their entrenchments
and submit their pretensions to a popular vote.",
Possibly the Federal Parliament may find
means to shift them some day. Possibly the
people may some day shift them with a red
banner, and an insurrection, and the offer of a ,
rope with a noose at the end of it. Or possibly ;
the Government, when it has more money to')
spare, will pass a Bill through the Assembly i
providing that future Councillors shall be paid,":
that the property qualification shall be wholly
abolished, and that any of the existing Coun-
cillors who are fired out by the people when ;
they get a free choice of M’sL.C. for the first'*
time, shall receive a pension of £lOOO a year A
each from the country in grateful acknowledg- j
ment of their past services. The 48 Landlords ;
would doubtless reject the Bill wdth scorn on ;
its first or second appearance, but about the ■
third time it came up they would grab at the -
country’s grateful reward for their services with •
both hands. The deliverance from its 48 Rich -
Landlords would only cost Victoria £48,000 a :
vear, and it would be dirt cheap at the price.

“ Barrierite ” to The Bulletin : *
It is doubtful whether any previous N.S.W. administra-
tor has made such audacious bids for the support of coun- 1
try constituencies as G. H. Reid. Here is a san" pie. A "
day or two before Parliament was dissolved he announced, "
after having conveniently allowed the matter to drift for ..
some time, that he couldn’t undertake to purchase the ‘
Tanawingee railway-line on his own responsibility ; but
he promised if returned with a majority to recommend
Parliament to provide for the purchase within;a month. 7
The excuse for this obvious bid was that the line would",
cost more than ±20,000 ; but, as a matter of fact, the r
prescribed maximum of expenditure without Parliamen-
tary authority (and Reid’s colleague, Carrutiiers, could 1
tell him how strictly the provision has hitherto been ob-;
served) was only reached by tacking to the £15,000!
(which was the purchase-money asked by the eo.)
the sums which it is estimated the repairs and addi-
tions to the line will cost during the next five
years. It was a pretty bold manoeuvre ; and at first sight
it is calculated to make at least four constituencies think
themselves interested in getting Reid back. But there
are, unfortunately for Mr. Reid,* one or two other con-
siderations. Thus the same four constituencies will
probably ask themselves who it is that might have, bought-
the line from this private company, and didn’t, do it ; and
they will probably also want to know who it was that, has
jeopardised the purchase of the line altogether, because
the Government’s right to purchase will have expired'
long before the new r House meets. And when they have
answered that the man who might have served them and
the country-but didn’t—is Reid, they may also come to
the conclusion that if through Reid's inaction the line
isn’t lost altogether, Barton is as likely to close with a
good bargain when he sees it as Reid is. Anyhow, it. isn’t
much of a recommendation to take a man to do certain '
wmrk that, when he might have done it before, he delibe-
rately declined to do it.
N.S.W. Wriggler Reid’s promise to tlie un-
employed when lie was hunting for votes just
before the 1895 election :
The Government have determined upon a vigorous
public works policy. The old system of relief works has
been discarded for legitimate undertakings that will ab- -
sorb all available labor, and further conduce to the pro- ?"
gress of the colony. These works are not to be confined
to Sydney, or in a special extent to any part of the "
colony. The whole country will participate in them.
The system of allowing the unemployed of the other
colonies to participate will not be allowed ; our own
workmen only will be employed on them. The works :
are to be of so varied a nature that skilled as well -
as unskilled men will find little difficulty; in se- ,
curing employment, and at properly remunerative :
wages. These works will include railways, harbor works,
bridges, roads, sewerage works, water supply, artesian
boring, wharves, public buildings, thinning out and other-
wise improving forest reserves, clearing land to promote
settlement, &e., so that employment will.be plentiful
both in town and country for some time to come. In this
w>ay work will be afforded in the interior, so that eventu-
ally the men will be able to draft themselves off into ;
private undertakings, and will in many cases also, no
doubt, be able, under the provisions of the land law just t
passed, to take up holdings and settle, thus further con- ,
ducing towards their own prosperity as well as to the
well-being of the colony. ,
N.S.W. Wriggler Reid’s promise to the un-
employed now that he is hunting for votes just ■
before the 1898 election : ;
I am happy to tell you that I don’t come before public ■
meetings and express my sympathy with the unemployed
members of the community, and then when I get into ■
office make no attempt to do anything for them. ._. . I
And I am happy to be able to tell you now that I am in a
position to put Work into the hands of the men of Sydney ,
which will more than exhaust all the able-bodied men
ready to take such work. Of course, I admit you can
never really do that, because the more men you take out
of the city the more you find coming in to take their
places. But that is the report which I have received >
from the officials in connection with this establishment.
The politician who promises just before the
election that if he is returned to power he will
find work for everybody just after the election,
js always with us.
Chamberlain’s attempt to buttress the consti-
tutional character of the Papuan land-grab.
agreement by pointing out that it was approved
by an ordinance of the Legislature of New
Guinea, directs attention to the constitution of
that Legislature. Joseph’s talk is so bold and
free, and the word “ Legislature ” carries, with
it such an air of popular right and Parliaitoen-" 4
tary judgment, that the unwary would be likely
to take such an ordinance as the equivalent of a
House of Commons Act. The Legislature of
New Guinea is, in the Parliamentary sense, a
Don Quixote or Sancho Panza ’sham. In con-
sists of five persons, four of whom are civil-ser-
vants find the remaining one manager for the
trading firm of Burns, Philp and Co.' One is
Secretary, one Treasurer, one a Judge, and one
a magistrate ; all practically in the employ of
Gov. MacGregor, subject to his directions and
bound to follow his ideas on Papuan develop-
ment. To apply the term Legislature ”* to
such a body, without attaching an'explanation,
is merely to throw dust in the public eyes.
The ordinance of such a body Should carry no
more constitutional weight than an agreement
signed by the Governor alone. .-o a

The “Little Minister" who toils in the

the overwhelming success that he deserves to be
The “ Royal Divorce," which was hardly anything
more than a great outbreak of clothes and big pic-
ture, and had practically no literary merit, boomed
with a decidedly bigger boom. Yet for art and
literary finish and human interest and flesh-and-
blood, the present abbreviated preacher is miles
ahead of that big, explosive glare. One is soul ;
the other was only paint-though it was certainly
very beautiful paint. But, perhaps, the trouble is
that, to the bulk of the inhabitants of this new
dry, hurried, sun-blasted land, Thrums is not
understandable. The four ancient Scotch elders
mourning on the fence because they think then-
hired expounder is running after a girl belong to a
country that still takes its religion seriously. The
£rey stone town with its houses 300 years old, and
its grey moss, and its red roofs, and its cobble-
stones, and its sleep, is a mystery to the country
where the unpainted, sun-cracked, wooden cot-
tage gets up like Jonah’s gourd on its four
posts, and it is only necessary to hide an
old kerosene-tin and a lank dog underneath to
make it home. Then the mortgage strikes it, and
the overdraft breathes upon it, and it crumples up
again like Jonah’s gourd, and is gone. The
picture of the slow old men who live in the slow
old town and have their chief recreation in think-
ing of the hereafter, and whose worldly joys
centre mostly round the kirk, is a very clever
picture. Also, the ridiculous back-view of the
elder is very true to life ; there are a few places in
the cold little earth-speck fhat Premier Reid
comes from where the hinder part of the elder
looks almost as ridiculous as that to this day.
But it is difficult for the Australian to realise the
fact.
* * * *
The co. which Harry Rickards has got
together at Her Majesty’s handles the Scotch
drama carefully. All its effect depends on that.
It is a delicately painted Old Master ; if an in-
ferior co. tackled it in an off-hand fashion it would
be only a loud raw oleograph. The deep, thick
Presbyterian piety of Thrums is laid on carefully
and the sleepy moral atmosphere, and the faint
haze of whusky on top of all. The Scotch
accent, however, has been mercifully toned
sufficiently to make things intelligible,
the Minister, and the two doddering small elders
and the big, hairy elder, and Miss Eloise Juno’s
old woman, and sweet Pattie Brown as the vision
of loveliness that leads the Minister away from
the straight paths of the Auld Lichts, are hardly
to be improved upon. But it begins to be ques-
tionable if Sweeney is quite certain whether he is
Insli or Scotch, and he compromises by being
very drunk in a language that is mostly plain
English. Miss Athena Claudius, as the small
boy Micah, does her little part well, and reveals a
pair of shapely bare brown feet, also a good deal
of the long human supports that are above the
feet, I hey are also brown and shapely, and Miss
Claudius does that end of the small'Scotoh boy
adnuralily—even better than she does the other
end. Ihe only despairful item is the red, unreal
soldier of Walner Gregory, who is stiff, and
wooden, and otherwise harrowing.
** * *
There is not one new drama in Sydney this
week. “White Heather,” at the Royal, seems
bent on an indefinite stay, and so many good
reasons can be found for its continuance that it
will probably last into August. Miss Gill, as
Codiva, is one of these reasons. There is no ab-
solute necessity for the intrusion of that ancient
and shocking person into a modern drama, but
she is introduced as part of certain private theatri-
cals, and she takes off her long cloak, and reveals
neiself dressed in nothing but fleshings and an
immense mass of fair hair, so suddenly that the
scandalised Lady Janet Maclintock hasn’t a chance
to burst through the door and escape in time.
Having once seen the shapely vision, the Scotch
Jadv Becomes too weak from shock to get
away, so she remains and sees some more.
e, i ifc ’ s ully explained to her that
tne other lady has undressed in the sacred
cause of charity, she becomes reconciled.
One point about “White Heather” which
calls for deafening applause is the absence of the
regulation fallen girl. Miss Watson is certainly
supposed to have fallen, but it proves that the
record of her marriage has only gone down at sea,
and towards the end it is honorably fished up.
Also Miss Frances Ross calls on bad man Baker
and offers to fall if necessary ; if he can get rid of
bis ■ first wife and marry her she admits that she
will prefer it, but if he can’t marry her she is
willing to fall. The providential drowning of
saker however, prevents this sacrifice of a very
beautiful and nicely-dressed woman ; so “ White
Heather gets through without a single blemish
on its character.

John Lemmone’s new concert co. opened
at Sydney Town Hall on Saturday to a fair house.
Evidently the eo. s Melbourne popularity had ar-
rived before it, for, with the exception of Miss
Verne s last performance, every item on the pro-
gramme was encored, and one of the encore guns
had a double barrel. Madame Alva is a
singer of the dramatic Italian school, with
a fine capacity for tragic emotions, a large,
strong voice, very thin in parts, but passion-
ate and executively skilful enough to almost
cover up the thinness. Miss Adela Verne,
the pianiste, is a gifted performer, with a little of
Ketten’s electricity, and, at times, an uncommon
breadth of expression. This varies, however;
witness her superficial interpretation of Chopin’s
Polonaise in A fiat. The tenor, Samuel Masters,
contributes an ordinary tenor voice with
rather less than ordinary style, and an extravagant
affection for the sostenuto device. Careful study
of this young man revealed what’s in a name. In
Samuel s case, the name tellsagood deal ofthe truth.
. took the wildly enthusing house at one fell
trip, away from “Stars of the Summer Night,’’
out Into the Garden, Maud,” then right off
to the wild remoteness of the “ Bay of Biscay, oh.”
But you could see the Academy all the trip.
Possibly the most masterly member of the co. is
John Lemmone himself, whose only fault is that
he plays the flute. It is only fair, though, to say
that at Mr. Lemmone’s lips the flute ceases to be
a flute, as understanded at the suburban terrace,
?i £ eco,n ® s a mos t desirable instrument, such as
the Seventh Heaven might condescend to play
when an eternity of harp-strings has worn its
fingers to the bone. To sum up, the company is
an evenly-balanced family, all good, none aggres-
sively startling, and none calculated to keep this
paper up too late o’ nights.

Sydney Lyceum is supposed to close for
two nights, while preparing for an extensive
Saturday night production of a new play, “Is
Life Worth Living ? ” The Lyceum is having no
luck worth speaking of just now ; two dramas and
a variety-show are about all that Sydney seems
able to pay for, and when there are three dramas
the third one is generally a stranded production
mourning on a rock. The last Lyceum drama
also suffered through the absence of Miss Ben-
susan, that pretty and promising actress having
removed her bright presence through illness.
1 herefore Diver, when he slouched on the stage
as an ominous and dirty old man with a Past, had
to shake a lady who, despite her various attrac-
tions, didn t compensate for the one who should
have been “shook.” “Is Life Worth Living?”
sounds very like the heart-wail of the manage-
ment inquiring of the universe in general whether
it is worth while keeping the theatre open if the
leading lady doesn’t come back promptly.

A Cuban war drama, built on patriotic
Bullanjonathan lines, is to wave the star-spangled
banner this week at the Royal Standard. There
is very little room on the stage for the two armies
to manoeuvre, but they intend to do their best.
Un Saturday night America will wipe up the
sacred soil of Cuba with Don Ramon and Don
Jose and Don Jaime and Don Juan, arrangements
having been made that all the thoroughly bad
people will be Spaniards, while all the Americans
will be persons of the very best character. General
Blanco begins to be struck by just retribution in
act lb), and in act 111. the full consequences of a
horrid life of sin plug him full in the weskit, and
he is doubled up. Then there is more star-span-
gled banner, and all ends gloriously.

The Poluski Brothers throw themselves
into the deadly breach at Sydney Tivoli this week
with a bustling military entertainment which has
taken the public fancy violently. There are two
five brothers in this act, and a quantity of dead
artificial brothers make up the rest of the army’
and the wild evolutions of that force are calcu-
lated to throw a completely new light on the art
and mystery of warfare. Sundry pairs of sisters
of good musical capacity have also added them-
selves to the bill, and the names of Winton, Wood
Marion Ainsworth, and Peggy Pryde continue to
lend grace and promise to that document.
** * *
The greasy emphasis with which the Melb.
dailies— after the event—announced that W. and
M. had nothing to do with “ The American Girl ”
fiasco, was somewhat sickening. Each paper
seemed anxious to “ state that Messrs. William-
son and Musgrove are not responsible for the pro-
duction, ’&c., &c. Paragraphs before the event had
not uttered any warning to that effect. Inad-
vertently or otherwise, the advts. in the Saturday
morning papers gave the impression that “The
American Girl ” was to some extent a W. and M.
show, and a lot of people undoubtedly paid their
money (ordinary Princess’s prices) on the strength
of the Firm s name at the top of the advt., and
the names of the Firm’s scene-painters, G. and J.
Gordon, at the tail end. Manager Williamson sat
in solitary state in the managerial box and
beamed upon the show—for a little while.
Ihen he withdrew, and on Monday morning ap-
peared two specia! advts. The first stated that
W. and M. had leased (large type) their theatre to
lemple and Moulton, and the second stated that
,7 • and , "b would resume active management on
the 23rd July. Under the circs, there was no oc-
casion for the dailies to apologise so profusely on
tne Firm s behalf. If the production of the
Australian native ” musical comedy had been
even a small success, would the Firm have rushed
in with such emphatic disclaimers of any connec-
tion with it ? Temple and Moulton pay a
week for the use of the Princess’s, it seems.
** # *
Last week The Bulletin wondered what
would happen to the tail-end of “The American
Girl ” season at Melb. Princess’s. The tail-end
was mercifully amputated, and on Tuesday last
the Firm were to resume business on their own
with “ The Prisoner of Zenda.” The story of the
crowned tourist runs for four nights, and on
Saturday the Early Christians will return with
their holy clothes-props, and the new Nero will
gnash his pagan teeth at some more “Sign of the
Cross,” which is a giddier entertainment than the
late unlamented musical-comedy, anyhow. More-
over, it is a large and glowing spectacle, calculated
to keep the souls of the righteous warm these
foggy nights.
** * *
Melbourne’s rooted suspicions re any show
that smacks of Yankee female took further
root on Saturday, owing to “Miss Chicago” at
the Bijou. “ Miss Chicago ” started with every
appearance of rivalling “ The American Girl ” in
utter foolishness, and nearly succeeded in the at-
tempt. If the two hopeless productions were
matched to run against one another, “Miss
Chicago” would probably win by half a week. It
is said (on the programme) to be hilarious, but
the writer didn’t notice any genuine merriment in
front of the house, except when a stout lady in a
brief blue skirt was called up to dance a hornpipe
duet with a thin lady, and neither lady could
dance worth a cent. For the rest, a comedian
who frequently cried “ Ditto ! ” was a better joke
than the damsel, who continually cried “Rats ! ”
in A mer i ca p Girl.” Also, the comedy at
the Bijou had a thin streak of plot visible amidst
its padded irrelevancy, to the effect that a nice-
looking young clerk married the niece of his em-
ployer by strategy, and secured all her real and
personal estate. This triumph of love brought
much soulful joy to an Angelina in the dress-
circle, who had been leaning heavily against the
shoulder of her best boy all the time, but the
Public at large didn’t find it thrilling. “Miss
Chicago ” is a vain and empty matter for such as
have nothing special to think about in the next
seat; therefore, if Miss Elsie Lander and co.
desire to fill the house for a long period they must
set up a new piece, and act it on an improved
system.

“The Idler” is bringing the Cartwright
season to a close at iVLell). Royal. On IMonday
next the co. will make its last appearance in the
big house, and all local admirers of good stage
work will be very sorry to see it go. Business
for “ The. Middleman ” last week was so big that
Cyrus Blenkarn might as well have gone on dis-
covering the secret of the old original Fatlow-ware
till the season expired, but Haddon Chambers’
drama is equally acceptable, and the change of
bill should serve as another reminder that Melb.
ought to have given better support to the same
co. when it showed at the Bijou, a few months
back.

Biondi, stated to get the highest salary
ever paid to one man this side of this planet, is un-
doubtedly the biggest success on record at the
Opera House since Rickards took over the lease.
Nobody can swear that Biondi is an unimpeach-
able impersonator of 12 musical composers—some
of them dead, very dead—but everybody admits
that the rapid Italian gives a dozen flashlight
changes of men, each man’s style harmonising with
a bit of the music which bears the name attached
to him. Biondi is a variety entertainment to be
seen often, and appreciated more and more. His
range of contrasts, notably from the wildly
humorous Suppe to the cold, dandified Arthur
Sullivan, is quite wonderful. As for the question
whether he sports a full mask for some
of the pictures, The Bulletin doesn’t care
how he works his changes—it is enough to take
them as they come, and there isn’t time to analyse
the miracles if one wanted to. Also, it is certain
that the artist introduces Mascagni without any
make-up to speak of, unless he borrows a pair of
rolling, frenzied eyes and sticks them into his
countenance for the occasion. Biondi, who was
the first performer in his line of business, and has
not been equalled by his imitators, is a thoroughly
deserving boom. Other new items at the Opera
House are Foreman and Fannen, and the Terry
Sisters ; and a “Musical Mystery” will make its
debut next week.

Newbury’s Pop. Concerts resumed their
success at Melb. Town Hall last Saturday, so it
would appear that the melodious Philip has created
a great winter want and can reckon on being able
to supply it at a profit for some weeks to come.
He didn’t sing his best the other night, but his
second best voice was very pleasant, especially in
a duet with Madame Spada—the giddy garden-
scene duet from “Faust,” which they sang in
English. Organist Wiegand, with his'“Storm ’’
and clever Miss Nina Schlotel on the violin
swelled the list of encores for the evening.
At Poverty Point.
There is very bad blood—visible from the auditorium—
between Julius Knight and his understudy, Gaston Mer-
vale.
Bright young George Majeroni, just back from the
Brough campaign in India, was re-engaged by manager
Williamson to play the little part of Fritz in “ Prisoner
of Zenda” at Melb. Princess’s. When “The Sign of the
Cross” takes place again on Saturday brother George
will, presumably, step into the Early Christian sandals
of Mario Majeroni, who travelled on to London with the
Broughs.
Unlucky tenor Rose, who was made the scape-goat of
“ The American Girl ” failure by being dropped out of
the cast after the first night, contrived to get a neat ad.
for his trouble, anyhow. He wrote rational letters to the
Argus and Age, quoting, in one of them, from the stuff
that he had to speak, and asking whether it wasn’t hard
luck for a light tenor to make a first appearance in Mel-
bourne under such awful circs. He had to start by re-
ferring to one of the characters as “ a carrot stuck in a
pot of ice-cream.” Afterwards, moaned the victim, “I
spun the ancient yarn of the evidences of a terrier’dog
being found in a boarding-house sausage ! I had to talk
about the filthy state of a lavatory towel, and speak a
few other subtle and refined inanities, and then it was my
painful dutj T to sing (with a cold in the head) in an in-
congruous costume a romantic song.” Rose may not be
the most brilliant actor in all the world, but he certainly
deserved a better show.
Ugo Biondi’s imitations of prominent composers are
wonderful enough as examples of characterisation, but as
portraits they are absolutely lost to Australian audiences.
A few local men would bring down the house that Biondi
has crowded every night since his arrival-say, for in-
stance, George Reid, Marshall Hall, Bishop Goe, Dr.
Bevan, and C. J. Madden.
“Holdar M.” : Sydney D.T. proudly alludes to the
“ patriotic outburst ” of a Saturday-night music-hall
audience, evoked by a stage comparison of the probable
conduct of a British crew as compared with the foreign
behavior at the Bourgogne wreck. A ventriloquial
dummy’s remark, that “ ‘ there’d have been more than
one woman saved if British seamen had been there,’ was
the signal for almost deafening applause.” This may be
in order as concerns the 8.5., but it recalls a recent
frantic rush at a false fire-alarm in a Melb. music-hall,
during which several women and children got badly
mauled by the escaping males. This in the hope that
the mentioned applause will ease off a little for the re-
mainder of that gag’s innings.
Biondi, the “quick-change” wonder, promises to get
much too fat for some of his business before he is a
middle-aged man. At present he can rush through it
without “ hanging out signs of distress,” as the horse-
reporter would say, but already his female impersona-
tions measure about 40 inches round the waist, and when
Biondi the lover con es mashing Biondi the wife, he has
to remark that she is “ nice gell—but too fat.”
Said that a temporarily-high personage is said
to have sent_ a message to Pattie Browne, ex-
pressing surprise and grief at Pattie’s having “ de-
scended ” to play such a part as Saucers in “A
Bit of Old Ohina.” Which was rather absurd, con-
sidering that the favorite actress ascended a ladder to
play some of her part. And, anyhow, the mawkish trifle
was written by a woman—the authoress of “ Little Lord
Fauntleroy.” Hence its awful improperness, no doubt.
When a woman tries to skate over thin literary ice, she is
pretty sure to slip and fall through.
“ Haresfoot ” : The crash of the “ American Girl ” was,
I think, simply due to the exigeant type of audience
created by the perfect staging of Williamson and Mus-
grove. Next day the alarmed firm put in explanatory
advts. that the theatre was let, and possibly they were
sorry, for nothing like such an affair ever happened at
the Princess’ before. At the Alexandra, or even at the
Bijou, the opera might have gone well enough. Why
did not the entrepreneurs take the Alexandra?
Madame Alva, who was only 18 when she appeared as
prima donna, under the late Sirgustus Harris’s manage-
ment, is married to an influential man, Edward St. John
Brennan. Hubby has edited one or two London weeklies,
is a well-known musical and dramatic critic, and the
author of some bright verses and Home-rulish literature.
He once stood for the Gloucester city seat in the House
of Commons.
Edwin Geach writes from Shanghai re China and the
Carl Hertz show : “ This is a gorgeous country for popu-
lation, stenches, bribery and wholesale corruption. We
have caught the wily Chow by the pigtail, and things
prosper with us. We have twice delayed our exit from
this city.” Hertz appeared at a Chinese (as well as the
local British) theatre, and there he had to give a money
guarantee that no woman should appear on the stage, so
Mrs. Hertz stood out of it, and the “ vanishing lady” was
represented by a vanishing man. Even cinematograph
pictures of women were prohibited. As soon as the cur-
tain had fallen on the second night’s performance, the
Chow proprietors fired a string of hundreds of crackers
secretly planted near the footlights. This by way of
driving the devil off the premises.
Maggie Moore and Roberts have pioneered Kanowna,
the Westralian deep-lead field, and at present the most

Question to be asked Premier Reid :
Where do you get all the blankets from ?
Colonel Mackay, of the “Real Mackays,”
is having an easy fight for the Burrowa seat in the
N.S.W. Assembly. A man named Kenneth Mac-
kay d’ye ken—who can induce a constituency of
Irishmen like “ Burrowha ” to elect him, and
stick to him, is something out of the common.
But the present generation at Burrowa, though
Irish by blood, is very Australian in sentiment,
The inhabitants of Burrowa are mostly
Michael Ryans, while Denis Burkes and Pat
Maloneys and Andy O’Connells are fairly plenti-
ful. In the old days, when the mailman drove
into Burrowa, the local inhabitants all gathered
round the cart and came up for the letters as he
sang out the names. One day he read out,
“ Letter for Michael Ryan,” There were 10 men
killed in the crush.
The gilded Hughes, M.L.C., announces
that he has quitted the Barton party and cast in
his lot with the Reid crowd of provincialists.
Barring Barton and Dick O’Connor, the Fossils of
the N.S.W. Council are rallying round Reid
almost to a man. A politician is known to a great
extent by the fossils who rally round him. The
gathering of the Rich Old Men to the Reid stan-
dard began when Reid announced that he rever-
enced the nominee House, and had a great regard
for the ancients who threw his Democratic
measures out on their joint and several ear, and
was going to preserve the Fat principle of
Nomineeism as a Holy Thing. And now the Tons
of Fat march unanimously behind the flag of the
self-styled “ Liberal party” of N.S.W,
For a whole week Premier Reid has given
up explaining what are the alterations he advo-
cates in the Federation Bill, and apparently he
will end by going to the country with no Federal
programme at all. His demand that the Federal
Constitution should contain a p. rpctual cast-iron
guarantee against the cutting-uD of any of the
huge, unwieldy States hasn’t been heard of for at
least a fortnight. He proposed to federate the
debts and to partly federate the railways, retain-
ing all the worst features of the present provincial
system; then he weakened and said that the
“last word” had not yet been spoken on the
financial problem ; and then he dropped that
Eainful subject also, and now no one knows what
is Federal financial policy may be. His later
speeches are mere furious bounce about how
he is going to demand concessions in the
name of “ the people ”of New South Wales. Yet
the majority of the voters polled and the majority
of the constituencies solemnly declared on 3rd
June that they were content with the Bill ; and
the lost minority is divided into the six different
minorities which want six different kinds of new
Bill, and the seventh minority which wants no
Bill at all. And Reid, thes licked and disgraced
champion of one of these minorities, demanding
amendments in the name of the people of N.S.W
is a very beautiful bluff indeed. As for the exact
nature of the financial concessions that are to be
demanded in the name of the small minority, that
is a matter which has disappeared into mist.'

The Westralian revenue for the year ended 30th
June, 1898, was £2,754,746, and the expenditure
£3,256,912, making a fine deficit of £502,166. There was,
however, a surplus of £315,362 left from previous years, so
the total shortage is only £186,804. Premier Forrest says
the situation doesn’t cause him any great anxiety, which
seems probable enough ; when a politician has been eight
years in office he will almost certainly have to go out soon
and leave the anxiety to his successor. Westralia’s debt
is now £54 per head (£9,204,507).
* * • *
Queensland spent 148,341 of loan-money in
1897, and 1 937,006 in 1898, so in proportion to population
the Northern province riots a great deal more violently
than any other of the seven, Westralia only excepted.
Only about £60,000 of the money, however, went for
wholly unproductive purposes, against about £700,000 in
N.S.W. The worst-looking item of the lot is £9926 for
immigration. The Government which borrows money for
the purpose of paying people to come to the country is a
pretty low-down affair.
* * • *
The affairs of the Bank of New Zealand have
been steadily improving ever since the State took the helm
out of the shaky and paralytic hand of Private Enterprise.
The year ended 31st March, 1898, shows a net profit of
£74,900. This is after paying interest at 4 per cent, on
£2,000,000 of State-guaranteed capital, and interest at 3J
per cent on £500,000 preference shares held by Govern-
ment, and after writing £10,132 off the Bank’s holding of
the Estates Co.’s debentures. The last four years’ results
are as follows :
March 1894, Profit £41,079 I March 1897, Profit £39,391
„ 1895, Loss 37,356 „ 1898, „ 74,900
„ 1893, Profit 35,325 I
As this is the amount that remains after paying the fixed
dividend on guaranteed stock and preference shares it
equals the splendid return of over 19 per cent, per annum
on the ordinary capital (£393,042). The annual payment
of £50,000 is made to the Assets Realisation Board to help
along the weary process of cleaning up the old losses, left
behind by the ancient private management, and £24,900,
being arrears of the said payment, are also cleared off. In
future the Bank has only the annual payment of £50,000
to face, and some day, when the Estates Oo.’s wreck is
cleaned up, that will cease also —though exactly when it
will cease it is difficult to guess.
The dubious assets of the B.N.Z. are also being
steadily reduced. The following is the list of doubtful
securities as they appeared in the two last balance-
March 1897. March 1898.
Assets Realisation Board De-
bentures £2,680,285 £1,880,285

Colonial Bank —Goodwill .. 75,000 75,000
£3,407,936 £2,555,575
Therefore the results of a year’s work are : an increase of
£35,000 in the profits; £74,900 paid off the old losses of
the B.N.Z. Estates Co. ; and the dubious securities in the
bank’s balance-sheet reduced by £852,000. The B.N.Z.
has now £2,893,000 paid-up capital ; £23,474 reserve-
fund and the State’s security behind that; and it holds
over £3,600,000 in cash and liquid securities, so it has a
record of progress and increasing stability that any in-
stitution might reasonably be proud of.

Another streak of unspeakably bad luck appears
to have fallen on the Bank of North Queensland, which
closes its half-year to 30th June, 1898, with a profit of only
£587. The last four years’ record stands thus :
Dec.,’94 .. Profit £1674 Dec.,’96 .. Profit £1717
June, ’95 .. „ 1736 June, ’97 .. „ 2003
Dec.,’9s .. „ 1182 Dec.,’97 .. „ 1559
June,’96 .. „ 1703 June,’9B .. „ 587
The present half-year’s profits are equal to 11s. 9d. per
cent, per annum on the nominal capital of £200,000, or £1
3s. 6d. per cent, per annum on the capital of £lOO,OOO,
that being the amount to which it is to be written down,
as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. So
the painful fact sticks out conspicuously that, unless
things improve materially, the B.N.Q. will be just about
as unable to pay dividends after the proposed writing-
down as it is now. The accumulated profit of £10,928 is
also put to a contingency fund, and this, with the pro-
posed £lOO,OOO, will make £170,928 of losses provided for
in the last five years out of the shareholders’ money, which
is a tremendous affair for a little institution which started
with only £250,000 capital.
The trouble with the B.N.Q. seems to be that it
has too small a business. Also it seems very probable
that when the management took £50,000 of deposits fixed
for 10 years at 4J per cent, it undertook an unprofitable
liability, for apparently the money doesn’t earn 4| per
cent, nowadays. The bank has paid no dividends since
’93, and even when it writes down its capital one-half its
profits require to be nearly three times the present half-
vear’s figure before it can pay a very humble 3 per cent,
ihe bank has £85,659 cash and liquid securities, which is
equal to nearly 29 per cent, of all liabilities to the public ;
both its cash and its deposits show a good increase ; and
from a depositor’s point of view the B.N.Q. looks secure
enough. But from a shareholder’s standpoint it looks
next door to awful. If the original founders had
bought Government securities with their money, and
never had any Bank of North Queensland at all, they
would he about 15s. in the £ better off than they now are.
If they .could sell their hank for £lOO,OOO and buy 3 per
cent. State securities with the money it should be a happy
release.
• * « •
The Queensland National Bank’s half-yearly
balance-sheet to 30th June, 1898, is the second since the
institution got fairly started on its reconstructed career.
It shows very little improvement on its predecessor. The
gross earnings (£44,237) are £2200 less than they were,
but considerable economies have been made by cutting
down expenses. Last half-year the profit was set down as
£16,635, and, after £8635 had been set aside towards
writing down old losses, the net profit was called £BOOO.
This half-year the profit is £17,795, and £8795 is set aside
towards old losses ; net profit, £9OOO. It is admitted,
however, that £4994 of this half-year's money is not ordi-
nary business profit, but recoveries from debts previously
written off ; but it is impossible to say whether any acci-
dental receipts of the same kind were included in last
half-year’s returns or not. On the whole, the general
result seems to be that the Q.N. Bank’s profits are no
better, and may he a little worse. The £9OOO which is
called net profit for the half-year equals £4 6s. pe r
cent, per annum on paid-up capital—which is good at
present rates. One-fourth (£2250) goes to reserve making
ft £4250. Another £2250 goes in reduction of that quai tei
(£456,331) of the Government’s reconstructed deposit
which is payable out of profits, and at this rate it will be
liquidated i'n 100 years. The remaining' £4500 goes in re-
duction of that quarter (about £1,000,000) of the 3
reconstructed deposits which are payable out of pronts
and at this rate they will be all paid in 111 y e a,rs. 1 he&
payments don’t reduce the interest burden and thus in-
crease profits, because the deposits in question carry n
interest. _ „
The balance-sheet doesn’t show the true position
of the Q.N.8., inasmuch as one-fourth (over £1,000,000) of
the private deposits was written off and doesn’t appear
among the liabilities. Nevertheless this sum has got all
to be paid (though only out of profits) and as long as it
has got to be paid out of anything it is a liability.
The Q.N.B. merely gets an indefinite extension of
time without interest and its liabilities are thus
£1,000,000 more than its alleged assets. And of its
alleged assets £731,000 is a very dubious something called
“ Debts in suspense pending Idealisation of Securities.
During the last six months this rather hopeless-looking
item has diminished by £12,000, whether by writing it
down out of profits, or by realising some of the securities,
doesn’t appear. Anyhow, this item evidently requnes to
be wiped off in some way before the Q.N.B. is on a
really sound footing, and at the present rate of progress
it will disappear in 30 years. During the halt-year
£46,222 has been written off capital on account of
forfeited shares, though where this money has gone to
doesn’t appear. It hasn’t gone visible reserve,
and it hasn’t been written off the £/31,000 of Debts in
Suspense”; possibly it has gone towards depreciation
somewhere else. The net result is that the Q.N.B. s
profits are moderate, and seem half-inclined to diminish ,
the private deposits (which have precedence over the old
liabilities, and are therefore perfectly secure) have in-
creased by £19,000 ; the bank is stronger than it used to
be in cash and liquid securities ; and it seems to he
paying its way and reducing its old losses. But at the
present rate of progress it looks as if it would take about
90 years to get really square, unless a new boom comes to
breathe on the dry bones of the old securities. And,
barring a new boom, the next dividend looks about that
distance off.

The Trustees, Executors, and Agency Co.
(Melbourne) shows signs of remaining just about the same
in its own small way. The half-year’s profits to 30th
June, 1898, are £1723, and the usual 5 per cent, dividend
absorbs £l5OO, leaving £223 to the good. This makes the
profit and loss balance £5198. The recent doings of this
institution are as under . .

During the above period £70,000 of the co.’s reserve has
been written off (leaving only £40,000) to cover losses,
and on present values there is another £l2 000 loss, or
possibly more, to provide for on account of £32,000 worth
of Australian Deposit and Mortgage Bank securities,
which are still included among the assets at their face
value The Trustees, Executors and Agency Co. has two
serioiis drains on its funds. It owns a leasehold in Queen-
street Melbourne, which costs about £650 more per
annum in rent than it produces ; the rent paid was fixed
in boom-time and the rent received is whatever the dull
times will produce. Also it has a £25,000 mortgage on its
freehold and £35,000 invested, most of it m the very
dubious securities above mentioned, to meet the mortgage
when it falls due; and theco. pays about *620 a.year more
in interest on the £25,000 than it receives for the £35,000.
When it gets rid of these two melancholy speculations,
and writes off its loss on the Australian Deposit and
Mortgage Bank investment, it ought to prosper again,
unless it rushes into another frantic career of big divi-
dends instead of rebuilding its shattered reserve fund. At
present the £1 shares are worth about Bs. on the market,
which, considering the 5 per cent, dividends, looks as if
public confidence was pretty low.
A deputation of pawnbrokers waited upon Vic.
Attorney-General Isaacs, the other day, to endeavor to
persuade him to “ let up” on the poor pawnbroker, who
is a philanthropist and a godly man. The strong reason
given why the profits of Israel should not be curtailed was
that such action would put it beyond the power of the
three-ball evangelist to do good deeds. When the Usury
Bill is passed, says Oppenheimer, the poor, pale widow
who wants to raise £lO on her worldly possessions that
are only worth £5 will have to be refused by the distracted
Hebrew. At present his profits are big enough to enable
him to bestow largesse on the widow and the orphan in
this way, but Isaacs is warned that the widow will get
nothing but the tears and sympathy of the sorrowful
Ikey if his measure becomes law.

Some weeks ago The Bulletin invited the ex-

sider whether the system of underground open-cutting
lately adopted in the Broken Hill mines, and especially
the British, is sufficiently safe. The officers, apparently,
didn’t answer ; but they may be a little more inclined to
do it now that another part of the roof has fallen in, kill-
ing a shift-boss, maiming a miner, and getting so near as
to scratch two or three others. As a matter of fact, the
shift-boss on this occasion dodged one fall only to run into
another. + , * *

Cobar Gold-Mines (old Fort Bourke) N.S.W.
By the reconstruction of this co. the old shareholders
have been called on to stand a liability of ss. a share or
drop out altogether. Every share held in Australia has
been taken up under the first call of 25., and a cable says
the London end of the scheme has been completely held
up. A further working capital of over £40,000 is thus
arranged for, and there is no doubt that four-fifths of it
will be called up. If this, under careful management,
does not put the old Fort Bourke mine on a div.-paying
basis it will be about time to give low-grade gold-mining
in Cobar best. The chances are all in favor of success.
Cobar has a lot of hard luck. It got a bad
set-back in the mess made by the Cobar Gold-
Mines * which mess helped bo knock the bottom out oi
the sale of other similar properties. The big mine of the
camp (Great Cobar) is growing apace, but the directors,
in their wisdom, have determined not to publish details
of the returns, hence these have to be guessed at, from
the reported sales of copper and the divs. declared from
royalty. The tributors say it is not their business to
publish either production or profits. Therefore, neither
mining men nor newspapers are able to make compari-
sons between one great copper-mine of which the public
hear everything—viz., Mt. Lyell, and another of which
they hear next to nothing. If it could be made, it would
be found that the Oobar mine, though a good way behind
in production, is very close up to (if, indeed, it does not
exceed) Mt. Lyell in profits. Be it also known to persons
who talk as glibly of opening up N.S.VV. copper-mines as
of opening a banana store, that the Cobar tributors had a
big struggle for a long time, though the ore was there as
big and as rich as to-day ; at times it was almost a toss-up
whether a mine, to-day worth more than a million, was
not thrown up.

“ Arbouin ” to The Bulletin from Chillagoe:
Re the furious little bluster of six or seven lines with
which “ S.J.” wipes out Chillagoe and the Herberton
District in a late issue. Chillagoe has been worked for the
last nine years, he says, but “we ” have abandoned it.
That’s quite true. Chillagoe, since its discovery, has
never been abandoned except by we, which, viewing the
present outlook of the district, must be a distinct disap-
pointment to we. Presuming, as “ S.J.” and one or two
other late paragraphists must, that all men connected
with Chillagoe are liars and villains of no shallow dye,
would it pay an able man in Stewart’s position to make an
absolutely false report, which he must be doing if “S.J. is
correct ? Also, what about Geologist Jack who, although
his report is not out, has admitted that it is extremely
favorable; and what about John Moffat, and those
associated with him in work on Chillagoe, sticking to it
for the last nine years and from time to time, m spite oi
the carriage and price of copper, making individual mines
on the field pay? Do they know nothing, all of them !
No, the trouble is that Moffat’s foresight and courage have
landed him very much on top. We wouldn t dig on
Chillagoe; he would; now we dig at him. It is improbable
that he has either time, necessity or inclination to dig
back.
Sixty men are working for the Linedale West
Chillagoe Co. (late Linedale Sj ndicate), at Bedford, or
Klondyke, or Arbouin (it will take its pick of the names
soon —said that the mining-commissioner has called it
Arbouin, certainly the most appropriate name of the
three, viz., that of one of the prospectors). Development,
though of course in its infancy, is going on vigorously.
The Spaniard, a shaft down about 20ft., shows a 2ft. lode
of solid copper ore ; lowest estimate of the few tons at
grass, 25 per cent. The Lamington, an open cut, 15tt.
high, shows from top to bottom 4ft. wide of ore of
quality. Laverock, Macao, Ladrones, Yankee, andbt.
Patrick are other good shows of same syndicate. M Clel-
land Bros.’ show, on Noonday Creek, three miles S.E. or
Arbouin, is a boomer on top, with no work done on it.
Four to 6ft. wide, it stands up out of the ground, solid
copper ore, and shows thus for about three chains along
its line. The copper is not all found yet—only yesterday
a Linedale West Chillagoe prospector located another good
surface show. I fail to see that this co.’s £lO shares (1500 of
them) were anything but good property at the £lOO at
which some of them changed hands. They are now re-
constructed into 3300 £'s shares. P.S.—This place is
looking first-class. I haven’t got a share in it, more s the
pity, so am not much prejudiced. “ S.J.” should pay it a
visit. . .
• * * •
Another Chillagoe man : Joseph Palmer and
Sons, Sydney, give some very fine and large information
in tbeir monthly share-list. In the same issue they say of
the Chillagoe Proprietary : “We have been favored with
reliable information about this enterprise, and learn that
the cost of constructing the railway will be far greater
than indicated by the promoters, as the country presents
great engineering difficulties, the line crossing mountain
ranges and spevvy ground. We also understand that there
is very little wood or water in the district.” This is all
right except for a few trivial mis-statements. The country
does not present great engineering difficulties—the Gov-
ernment line covers all the mountain ranges on the way-
excepting only the sharp pinch known as the Feather-
bed at Koorboora. There is no spewy ground.. The line
passes through one of the richest timber districts m Aus-
tralia. There is always plenty of water to be got by easy
sinking in the driest months, and in the rainy season the
hundreds of creeks are swimable and dangerous. Other-
wise the cocksure Palmer is perfectly correct.

“ Old Miner ” : Randolph Bedford wants to
know what the Griffith, Girofla, Harper, Atherton, and
Mt Garnet are if not true lodes? Now, having “been
there,” let me tell Mr. Bedford that there are no true
lodes on Chillagoe ; all the so-called rich mines are sur-
face-deposits, and many have been clean duffered-out.
Mt Garnet is a big formation of low-grade ore, and lies
about 80 miles from Chillagoe. I have visited many of
the “ mines ” pegged-out recently, and can safely say that
most of them are as free of copper as a hog is of feathers.
* * * *
Be Chillagoe: “Stewart’s report on the C.P.
Co.’s properties has been described as a plain, straightfor-
ward, workmanlike statement of fact. A perusal and
examination of the plans accompanying it does not bear
out this description. Mr. S. states that owing to the
enterprise of the Q. Govt, these districts have been
thrown open to private enterprise, and must shortly yield
their latent mineral and other resources. He has over-
looked, or forgotten, the fact that long before there was a
railway over the range, when most of the transport was
by team, or pack animals, via Port Douglas, fortunes
were made out of the mines on the Herberton district,
and that Chillagoe and other centres were opened up and
worked over ten years ago. If there is any reason
for the Chillagoe copper-boom on account of the
increased facilities offered by the railway, why,
in the name of common - sense, is there not
also a tin boom? The mines in the past proved highly
remunerative, the tin-dressing methods are even now
antiquated, and present prospects in many local tin pro-
perties look decidedly better than those of most of the
copper-mines, with the great desideratum up to date-
economical mining treatment and management.
“ The rich copper deposits of Cobar, Mt. Hope,
Cow Flat, Milburn Creek, and others in N.S.W., and Peak
Downs, in Queensland, paid well very many years ago
with further land carriage, worse appliances and methods
of treatment than are available now at Chillagoe, and alto-
gether under worse conditions than Chillagoe ever had to
bear up against, so that contention has no weight.
With regard to the railway, Mr. S. says the accompanying
plan seems most favorable. Just so : ‘lt seems. Every-
thing ‘seems’ right through the report. What sort of
phrases are these to convey any idea of the value of a
mining’ property to intending investors: ‘lt is not un-
reasonable to believe . . . Large deposits, more or less
impregnated . . . What appear to be most favorable in-
dications . . . With a proper system of exploration, great
results may be expected.’ The only definite statement
which, again, ‘ it only seems desirable to give,’ is the esti-
mate of ore in sight, and this, on Mr. S.’s own showing, is
merely a guess, as it is impossible to measure up any single
body of ore, or to sample it. Moreover, if, judging from the
heaps at grass, all of which are well sorted, Mr. S. reckons
his estimate of 500,000 tons in sight will go 10 per cent,
copper, it is the opinion, not of a professional pessimist,
but of one who does not care to bite off more than
he can chew when other people have to suffer for it.
He had to go round and examine a lot of picked
heaps of ore alongside inaccessible workings, together
with well-executed, sanguine, and apparently correct
plans. Surely no human being could possibly verify the
correctness of the supposed formations as shown on the
plans, in the time spent by Mr. S. on the ground, even if
the whole place had not been covered with long grass
armed with irritating spear-grass seeds. So far from any-
thing having been as yet proved, this present writer con-
tends that the whole group of mines are in a worse stati
than when absolutely virgm.
“ In the synopsis at the end of the report why
has 4064 tons lOcwt. been put down for 20-61 per cent,
copper, while a discreet silence is maintained as to the
contents of the other 6339 tons said to have been treated!
Why, again, has the system been followed in the report
of naming only the groups of leases, and referring to
the different properties by numbers, thus making
it difficult for even one who knows the mines to
follow the description properly, when it would have
been so easy to have taken the principal mines by name
and said yea or nay to them and their capabilities, and
left the scores of ‘ shallow excavations ’ and ‘ small de-
posits which do not call for further special a'tention’ to
take care of themselves? Of lease No. 15, Redcap group,
Mr. S. says it is to be regretted that the 200 ft. shaft is not
accessible, as it is the deepest in the district. Perhaps it
would be as well to ask Hon. J. A. Wallace, or the old
Queensland Prop 00. who worked it, what they think of
it—or perhaps the assay of the sample of pyrites taken
from the dump, 2 - 94 per cent, copper, 4oz. i6dwt. silver
per ton, is sufficient information. The par. relating to
lease No. 25, which Mr. S. reckons to rank as probably the
largest in a series of very large properties, is so lukewarm
and indefinite that if nothing better could be said of it its
flotation in the best district in Australia would be impos-
sible at any other than fever-heat boom-time.”

Mt. Morgan Gold Mining Co. dividends for
year, £300,000 ; wages, £139,000 ; new west works:,
£39,000; new mundic works, £15,000. Quantity of ore
handled during year has kept on increasing until in May
last it reached 17,455 tons. When new mundic works are
completed it will reach 19,000 tons. 24,704 tons of mundic
ore were treated for 90,5510 z ; 61,313 tons of oxidised ore
yielded 53,8440 z. ; 64,721 tons of low-grade ore gave
24 3040 z. ; and 2459 tons of mundic tailings were treated
for 16250 z. Prom ores sent to Aldershot 5230 z. were re-
ceived making a tdtal of 153,297 tons of ore and
170 860 oz. gold —giving an approximate average of loz.
2dwc. 7gr. to the ton. As dividend-duty returned £15,000

matted with gold and good for about 150 oz. This is all
from the old Indicator lode (which is not a lode at all,
really) from which the Ballarat leads were probably fed —
poor in the main but flecked with such patches, so the
miners hang on eternally.

Westralian mines and markets The Ade-
laide market continues very dull, without much business
doino- though prices in the leading stocks keep fairly
firm.” Lake View Consols had a fine output for June ; the
Ivanhoe cyanide plant is now running ; Hannan’s Brown
Hill plant is just getting under way; Horseshoe s 20
stamps should be running by the end of Aug. ; and de-
velopments at the Associated are being pushed on with
much vigor. They have one shaft down now 540 ft., and
will soon be cross-cutting simultaneously from two
shafts at 500 ft. and also at 300 ft. and 400 ft. There may
be a big stir in this stock within the next couple of
months, as they are also increasing their milling power,
and will resume shipping telluride ores again directly.
Generally the prospects of the big mines are good. The
question of the hour is the Boulder milling con-
tract, which looks like a monstrous job; it must be
detrimental to the interests of the Boulder shareholders ;
because the Boulder co. should treat its own tailings
iust as easilv as the Lake View or any other co. per
cyanide ; it is costing the Lake View co. at the most 9s.
per ton, and this, no doubt, will be materially reduced ;
it will be costing the Boulder co. from 9s. to 15s. per ton
more in accordance with the amount of gold extracted !
In London strong opposition is being made to this con-
tract with the object of forcing the directors to annul
it, and it is probable a big change will be made on the
Board, and more than likely that ‘ Billy * Jones will be put
on the Board by the dissatisfied shareholders. One thing
is certain—the Boulder directors have not yet heard the
end of this contract and have a very nasty time in store
for them.
“ Outside of Kalgoorlie, every mining-centre
pretty well has one or two mines, in some instances more,
giving really good returns of gold. The prospects of the
fields generally have never looked better, though the
market is so bad. However, bedrock seems somewhere
near, and, within the next six months or so, Westralia
will receive a great deal of attention ; not only Ival-
goorlie, but many other centres. Kanowna alluvial-
diggers are turning out an immense amount of gold. This
may be another Johannesburg ; it is quite on the cards
that a banket-formation will be found. lam assured
that there is one, but, under existing laws relating to
alluvial, it would be useless taking up any country to go
in for big work.
Three great W. A. producers: Lake View Con-
sols 5792 tons, 92730 z. : Ivanhoe, 1895 tons, 29030 z.;

Brown Hill Central (Kalgoorlie) is improving in
London, it having been officially declared that Bottomley

months back, the slightest rumor that the Bottomley
Group had anything to do with a mine sent the shares up
—and false rumors to the effect that Bottomley wasn’t
in it had to be instantly denied. Things are upside-down
now.

As illustrating the ill-digested "jumble of
opinions which constitute N.S.W. law, the case of
a Ked tern man lately sent to prison for disobeying
an order of the court,, commanding him to pay £3,
may be cited. That man will have to stay in
prison, if he does not pay for 12 months. If,
on the other hand, he had, when the money was
due to the court, stolen £3 from a shopkeeper or a
lawyer and paid it over to the court, he would
nave escaped prison on the order racket, and if
discovered and convicted as a thief, would cer-
tainly not have been sentenced to more than a
couple of months, and would probably have got off
with a fortnight. The law, therefore, unwittingly
makes it well worth a court-debtor’s while to
thieve from someone near him as much as will
satisfy his blind creditor’s claim.

Private school teaching generally involves
more abject poverty than any of the other
genteel professions; but in S.A. the poverty is
more abject than usual—due, possibly, to the
strength of the denominational institutions. Of
the principal private collegiate schools which have
existed in the province during the last 15 years,
nearly every one has, at some time or other, been
forced to “arrange” with its wretchedly-paid

The Licensing Bill now before Maoriland
i arhament contains one noble feature : It pro-
vides that when the publican is fined for allowing
men to drink on his premises after hours, the
drinkers shall be hneable m exactly the same pro-
portion. Which is decent justice, anyhow. When
a red-nosed individual prays for Sunday drink till
-IT? supplies it, he should take part of the
responsibility as well as the whole of the pleasant
feeling in the stomach. The publican is really the
less guilty of the two. The red-nosed Sundayper-

and the customer commits two of them), the old
law whereby he took none of the risk was out-
rageously one-sided. Moreover, the drinker, by
reason of the fact that his nose is a blot on the
scenery, calls for no special consideration.

Vic. Factories-Inspecfcor Ord reports that
many women have to work very long hours for a
pittance of about 10s. a week, and that one case was
that of “ a lady in reduced circumstances making
nightdresses, whose earnings for a hard week’s
work amounted to 6s. These wretched prices ”it
is added, are paid by one of the largest firms in
the city, and it can only be hoped it is done bv
the managers without the knowledge of individual
members of the firm, who figure largely in religious
and charitable work.” Sanguine Mr. Ord 1
Onlys : How’s this for a run of bad
luck ? It was told me by a veracious and super-
stitious old man. “I went into a Melb. hospital
° n a was put into a ward with thirteen
beds in it; the wall was decorated with peacock
leathers ; had a cross-eyed nurse attending on me;

catalogue as this should
be set to impassioned
drinks, and invited him
to that effect. As we
were walking down street
he stopped in front of a
sign-painter’s ladder, and
then skipped into the

A powerful address on the danger of a
woman getting married to her best “ boy ” was
delivered in a Victorian court recently. A
woman was suing her husband for ‘'main-
tenance, and—‘‘she stated that, though then
married to another man, she was improperly inti-
mate with hubby for live or six years, and bore him
two children. In November, 1897, she obtained a
divorce from her old husband, and continued
living with the new one until April, 1898, when
she was married to him. From that time his
treatment of her changed. He beat her, treated
her like a dog,” &c., &c.
Never whacked, and seldom chidden,
Long as they are fruit forbidden
Edwin’s darling feeds her lover, suiting then his palate
well.
Marriage makes the mateship lawful,
Then he thumps her “ something awful ’’;
Passion holds him in subjection till the parson breaks the
spell.

A strange fatality occurred in a Melbourne
suburb recently. The story illustrates a fact
long patent to many men how unlit women
are to be mothers. The child of this particu-
lar woman was taken ill with bronchitis, or some-
thing of the kind, and the doctor recommended a
steam-bath, but did not think it necessary to ex-
plain the difference between a steam-bath and a
fire-escape, so the woman was left to carry out her
own idea of what a steam-bath ought to be. She
fastened a piece of hose to the spout of the kettle
and placed the kettle on the fire. The other end
of tt S e hose she introduced under the blankets of
the cradle in which the baby lay. Then the
mother went away, and thought no more of the
pauent for some time, and when at length she
htted the child from the cradle it was so horribly

CUPID’S COMPLAINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Boy Cupid long had sought in vain
To win a maiden to his train,
By many a deep-set cunning plan
With amorous youth and learned man.
At length one day he saw her sit,
Eyes deep in thought, and brows close knit,
And chuckling softly in his glee,
“ I have you now, my love ! ” quoth he.
But Cupid’s face fell in dismay,
For, coming .-lose, he heard her say,
“Beginners’ Latin class at two
And of my Euclid girls, a few
Will be at Statics ; with the rest
Gen’ral revision would he best—
Those copy-books should ordered be—
I must enforce strict French at tea.
... A paper for my junior-class—
I wonder if that girl will pass ? ”
Poor Cupid, struck with shame and grief,
Turned to his mother for relief—
“ Scold not thy son,” was his complaint,
“ If Cupid’s power is growing faint,
But rather blame the Fates above
That maidens have no time for love ! ”

some perquisites, and some purloined ex-

readers and town readers of country papers,
who hunger for some particular journal.
This would have to be bought or stolen,
as before, but it is more difficult and
dangerous to appropriate three separate
halfpennies or postage - stamps. Also,
stamps and pennies are Beer. Add to
all this that daily papers several weeks old
and weeklies months ditto are passed on
without inspection. Free education can
be had even with stale literature, just as

Sydney Daily Telegraph reports an in-
teresting discovery made at Newcastle, N.S.W.,
on July 3, by Lloyd’s surveyor when going over
a barque. He had removed the close lin-
ing in the after-hold, and was applying the
hammer to the cement and plates, when the jar
of the blows revealed a rivet-hole, three-quarters
of an inch in diameter, in one of the plates about
3ft. from the keel. The water rushed in as the
frail stopping of cement was knocked out, and the
aperture had to be plugged up. A minute inspect
tion of the plate led to the belief that the hole
must have been a false one, originally filled up by
a blind rivet, which had fallen out. Had the
cement, which alone kept the ship dry, been
knocked out of the hole at sea, the vessel would
probably have gone to the bottom without anyone
knowing the exact reason why. And another
score of sailors’ lives might have been added to
the formidable list accumulated by Newcastle
coffin-ships.

commenced to retail his indiscre-

Dear Bulletin. —About four years since,
in Tasmania, a man got gaoled over a girl under
the age of consent, age only being considered—for
the consent was there right enough, as per usual
with her. Accused faced Justice Adams (just re-
tired on a pension), who went sour on him, and
treated him to ten years’ hard, leaving a wife and
six children to shift for themselves. A little later
one Horsley brutally beat to death the paramour
who was tramping about the country with him,
for which Judge Dobson sentenced him to five
years hard. How beautiful are the grand old lag-
time traditions of Vandemonia, — July Fogg.

Concerning the frequency of suicide
amongst Chinese prisoners in Australian prisons,
“ Timi ” writes to The Bulletin
The Chinese, of all the alien races in Australia—and I
include European foreigners in this category—show the
lowest per centage of criminals. Those who do come into
conflict with the law are thus, from their very fewness, .
isolated from others of their nationality, and I have no
doubt that it is the distressing strain of miserable loneli-
ness that is chiefly accountable for the proneness to
suicide of Chinese convicts. This isolation increases the
terrors of imprisonment ten-fold, and it seems to me that
it would he a simple act of humanity to permit the
Chinese to serve their sentences in some central prison
where they would not be cut off entirely from their
compatriots.

Woman on a Bicycle.
Since the fair sex has taken to bicycle-riding,
much has been written and said as to whether the
practice is injurious or not. We do not intend to
go into the scientific details of the subject, but it
is self-evident that a healthy woman, with a
throughly regulated system, is much better able
to indulge in such exercise than one whose general
health is not so good. Bile Beans for Biliousness
are just the medicine to keep the whole body in a
healthful state. They keep the liver in regular
working order, purify the blood, and clear all
waste matter from the system, thus reducing to a
minimum the chance of the delicate female organs
becoming deranged. They are an undoubted
specific for influenza, colds, biliousness, indiges-
tion, costiveness, piles, and all liver and kidney
complaints. They are made in one of the largest
and best equipped laboratories in the world, at
Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., and have been used
by the best physicians in that country for years.
They are for sale by all chemists, and in purchas-
ing be sure you get the genuine. Whether you
ride a bicycle or not, you will find Bile Beans an
invaluable specific for all the above ailments.*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, July 19, 1898.
My Dear Myee—
The Sydney Ladies’ Sanitary Association began
its winter season with Prof. Anderson Stuart’s
lecturette on “ Brain and Brains.” Similar little
hygienic homilies are to be delivered on five subse-
quent Mondays, for the benefit of enquiring
feminine minds. Hot-haired Dr. O’Neil holds
forth on fevers next week, and later on Drs. Camac
Wilkinson, Dagmar Berne, and Reuter Roth are
to give advice gratis on their own pet diseases.
As far as one can judge from lecture No. 1, the
grade is not going to be too terribly steep. Dr.
Anderson Stuart’s information was translated into
the very easiest English, adorned with just such
funny little anecdotes as a schoolmaster employs
to animate a class of schoolgirls, and had the
generally-debilitated air of medical information
laid down by a scientific man for lay ladies’
information.
The old, old frog that kicks its leg at so many
similar functions appeared again, and everyone
brightened up when Lady Hampden tried her
hand at rousing one kick more from the dead
beast. Have you ever wondered at the mesmeric
effect Her Ex.’s simplest movement has on a female
audience ? Everyone smiles with delight, and
the back row cranes over in wild terror lest it
should miss some of the genuine Govt. House
doings. This because Lady H. has turned to look
at the brain chart on the wall behind her. On
Monday, however, Her Ex. valiantly withstood
all this artillery of smiles and stares, and put her
little questions to the lecturer with heroic in-
difference.
The latter part of the lecture dwindled away
into a dissertation on the management of babies.
The lecturer owned up to the truth that a little
Anderson Stuart had set his mind working in
this direction, and gave utterance to a maxim that
sent cold shivers down many maternal backs. To
tempt a baby to laugh with a dangled finger is
worse than wicked. Maternal devotion must now
cease from distributing the philosophical reflec-
tions of its six-weeks-old offspring.
But here’s a touching story of maternal de-
votion for you. A bride and bridegroom left
N.S.W. one recent day for a honeymoon in Mel-
bourne. Next day the bride’s mother, wasting no
time, began hysterics. She uttered one cry con-
tinuously, “Icannotlive without her.” Sameafter-
noon she caught the express, and followed her pet
lamb to Melbourne. And from then, till the end
of the honeymoon-k-trois, wherever they went she
went too.
An engagement is announced between two jolly
good fellows, Mrs. Wolstenholme, our advanced
suffragist, and Professor Anderson, of Sydney
University.
And that reminds me that the newly-wedded
Earl of Seafield spent his honeymoon in Sydney
last week, and left on Saturday for London. The
Earl is an auburn-haired youth with nothing but
his big nose to point to his descent. His romance
runs chiefly on the startling impecuniosity of his
clan. The title is said to be the poorest in England.
Sydney University is agog with excitement
over the engagement of the Professor of Anatomy
to the daughter of an eminent Q.C. The young
lady attended anatomy-classes to further her pur-
suit of art. An engagement, expected to be an-
nounced shortly, is that of yet another professor
—to an ex-student, this time. The University
will probably be too small to hold all the women-
students who will desire to enroll themselves
next year.
Mr. Henry Gullett, acting-editor of S.M.
Herald, though he has not the rose in the shape
of a literary son, yet comes very near the rose next
month, when he acquires the clever Mr. Thomas
Heney, of the Herald staff, as a son-in-law.
Next month will be a great one for weddings.
Miss Lilian Manning, niece of the late Sir Wil-
liam, is to marry a remote connection of the same
name, who deals in “chilled meat,” and retire to
Bega (N.S.W.) for a season. Mr. Lister-Lister,
the artist, is also to be married soon.
Spite the ads. that heralded Madame Alva as
the greatest living dramatic soprano, her fame had
not previously spread across the Pacific. And it
appears to have only partially penetrated into
London smoke, for several musical Londoners
doing “ the Kawlinies ” appear to have known
little about Madame until now. It seems that you
have to come to Sydney to learn all about the
world’s greatest wonders.
The Alva concert co. arrived last week and
opened at the Town Hall on Saturday night.
Alva herself is a fragile, poetic-looking Jewess with
a small, dark head, a willowy figure,and a delicate,
intelligent face, that assumes a surprisingly im-
passioned expression as she sings. Her attractive
appearance was deepened on Saturday by an
Oriental robe of scarlet silk, brocaded heavily
with golden flowers, the biting scarlet kept away
from her face by a creamy confection of the cor-
sage. The fragility of her physique gives you no
warning of the intense abandon she is going to put
into her song. Her voice is a peculiar organ, finely
cultured in the true Italian school, fluent, expres-
sive, extremely dramatic, but lacking in velvet,
and a little doubtful in attack. Given a great
organ to sing with, Alva has feeling, ability, and
courage enough to be the greatest living dramatic
soprano, but her present voice does not take her
quite there. She put a tremendous lot of meaning
into her Wagnerian and Italian arias, and the
public quite understood. Then, too, translations
of the Italian and German words were printed on
the programme.
The pianiste, Miss Adela Verne, was 19 some-
time, but I should hardly think it was last year.
It may have been the year before. Why is youth
supposed to make good playing better ? But a re-
action is against premature performances, and
soon we shall be at the other, and more rational
extreme, where one asks of a pianist, “ how old ? ”
instead of “ how young ? ”
Anyway, Adela Verne is a magnetic, vivacious
player, with a masculine breadth that would have
made a magnificent artist of Elsie Hall, but with-
out the gentle Elsie’s superior scholarly technique.
Several sparkling modern compositions were very
racily rendered. Her gowning agreed with her
advertised 19 years—a white young frock with a
waist and a sash, and baby sleeves, and a lace neck-
frill. The other Miss Verne has so little to do
with the programme that I imagine she was
brought from home expressly. You know it is
quite up to date just now to send to England for
little artists, and put them into little blanks,
that innumerable colonial artists, just a little,
are pining to fill.
The rest of the company comprised another
blank-filling member, Samuel Masters, a mediocre
tenor, hardly possessed of “the grand manner,”
and John Lemmone himself, who stands so quietly
and smiles so modestly that you hardly realise he
is one of the greatest living flautists. Even before
Albani came, we had grown to expect all greatness
to be branded with a dazzling, smiting smile. I
long to hear again the lovely impromptu of Lem-
mone’s own compositions, given as an encore on
Saturday.
Another musical event of the week supported
that fine old adage, “The Fewer the Few, the
’igher the Art.” This was Madame Kellerman’s
Soiree Musicale, when M. Wiegand was presented
with the “palms” of Offieier d’Academie, and a
speech tied up in flowery French ; and the audience
was given many local compositions to soothe the frac-
tiousness that might follow on a French recitation
and several French speeches. The soiree squashed
in an unusual hall at Church Hill, hung round
with colored pictures of the Agony and the Atone-
ment. And the soiree matched the hall. I mean
to say it was unusual. Madame Kellerman
frisked round in blue satin with her hair hanging
down her back in little curls, and her youthfulness
more pronounced than ever, and all went well
until one fiddler wanted to alter the programme
and play before another fiddler who was billed for
an obligato to a leading baritone’s song. Then a
storm began to brew, and hot winds prevailed be-
hind the scenes. Perfesh’nal variances are not
worth ink and paper, but I record this one for the
sake of the courteous baritone who was dragged
into the discussion, got upset with the fiddling
squabble, and lost his voice in the midst of a local
ave.
But the funniest part of that soiree happened
with the medal and a bow (please pronounce this
bo). The razory Frenchman faced the big, bulgy
Belgian, and a series of bows began. Biard
d’Aunet’s curtseys were as French as Wiegand’s
were Flemish, and the quaint study in bobs en-
dured for over a minute. Wiegand then coolly
drew his reply from his pocket and read it aloud
with Madame Kellerman peeping over his.
shoulder. It remarked that recent experience
had taught silence was golden, and he simply
thanked everyone for the honor they had paid
him. A rumor got abroad that all the organists
had been united in the bonds of friendship that
same evening, but it seems unlikely.
Yet another musicale was given by various
fowls, dogs and canaries at the Exhibition Build-
ing during the week. Owing to the superiority of
the feathered tribes, this soiree lasted three days,
and was as loud on the last day as the first. It
isn’t everyone who can rave over a fowl, but surely
the most cosmopolitan fancy will thrill to a
Brahmapootra hen two feet high, walking about
with the most exaggerated elegance in thick
white feather bloomers. I also fell in love
with an immaculate white owl, placarded the
finest in the show. But it made no response what-
ever to my suit, and after that experience I’m in-
clined to think owls are not the Solomons they’re
painted.
When Madame Alva is not gushing about
Donizetti to press interviewers, she wanders by
the seashore, marvelling at the beauties of “ Our-
arbour.” Armed with a kodak, she inspected
Manly one day last week, but to the Manlyites,
sated with the charm of the surrounding sea and
landscape, there was infinitely more to gaze at
and admire in the prima-donna’s chic Parisian
fawn-and-rose-pink-costume, her remarkably tight
white lace veil, ravishing toque, and dainty
parasol.
A visit to Pattie Browne revealed a libel on that
lady’s physique. She looks slighter than of yore
in her walking dress, and infinitely more graceful.
She has also lost her old firm faith in Australia’s
critical capacities. Six years in London, with fat
salaries, and the prospect of fatter ones, have
turned her head the other way, and she now
frankly expresses a contempt for her old home-
made paper-cutters, butter-knives —even jam-
spoons. In fact, finds the press deteriorating, and
the public taste nowhere. In the light of day, she
is as young and healthy-looking as behind the
footlights. She has acquired a large amount of
chic as regards her frocking, but suffers from a
stiltedness of expression that sits ill on merry
Pattie Browne, the born soubrette. The Court
Theatre, or the Adelphi, claims her when her six
Australian months are over.
By the way, it was a bit of bad luck for Pattie
that she returned to Sydney while Bland Holt
was showing off Miss Fitzmaurice Gill as Lady
Godiva at the Royal. Mankind is the same
old George—l mean Adam.
Another Miss Kerr (the youngest) has joined
the Bland Holt co. The family consists of four
daughters, two of whom are married and accom-
plished musicians. All are good-looking and have
the “well-set-up” look that smart Melbourne
girls so much affect. Miss Annie Kerr is a dis-
tinct addition to the pictorial effects of B.H.’s
drama, “ White Heather.”
Bland Holt has also acquired a first-rate musi-
cian as leader of orchestra —Mr. Percy Kehoe.
The descriptive overture played to the “ White
Heather” is a very fine study, containing a tuneful
canon in three parts, and winding up with a
march in which most skilful contrapuntal effects
are again employed. This overture deserves to be
heard soon and often by itself in public.
Thus the self-satisfied innocent who chatters in
the woman’s column of the Sunday Times (July
17): —“ The elections. My advice has been taken
about Women Suffrage. The politicians have
dropped it, and no voice of protest is heard.”
After all, why spoil a pretty little theory for the
sake of a fact ?
Society dames, who have lately returned with
a Hinglish polish, no longer give curt little nods
to their friends, but bow slowly from the waist.
“ She bends her back, and bows her head,” as the
author of “ Dorothy ” put it.
Now that women have taken to riding bikes and
mending them with hairpins, the supply of the
latter implement will soon be no longer equal to
the demand. At any rate they seem to be antici-
pating such a state of things in England already,
for an Australian visitor writes that the ladies
there no longer confine their tresses with hairpins,
but with a kind of long comb that bends back-
wards and forwards catching up all the hair, and
finally sticks out on top as an ornament. This is
the lucid description of a mere man, but it sounds
very pretty.
Erom Messrs. Paling and co. comes a cata-
logues of pianos, well-illustrated with pictures of
their finest stock. The time-payment list ap-
pears to be enjoying huge patronage from the pub-
lic, and I believe that the testimonials are endless
from those who are satisfied with their bargains.
But what about a testimonial from the man next
door ? Now, he is the one whose word would be
really invaluable. Yet the music-firms never in-
vite him to testify.
The same firm sends Maud Fitz-Stubbs’ latest
composition, “ The Premier Waltz.” It is dedi-
cated to George Reid, and, for Miss Fitz-Stubbs’
sake, I hope his sun does not set too quickly. The
waltz is a bright, loud measure of the same type
as the famous “Heather,” and I see no reason
why it should not be as popular. Another local
lady, Miss Annie Summerbelle, sends me
a waltz, “The Almida ” (Nicholson and
co.). This is marked with a tuneful
second movement, and has already caught
on in Sydney ball-rooms. From W. R. Fur-
long comes a new song, “Babbie,” inspired by
“The Little Minister” and dedicated to Pattie
Browne. A winsome picture of Pattie adorns the
cover, but the song nowhere comes up to that
picture. The words set out to tell some strange
story in still stranger Scotch, but what the music
has to do with the words I am incapable of dis-
covering. And what either have to do with print
is a still more impossible problem. I have also
received a copy of a conscientious little magazine
calling itself the Australian Musical Times
and Magazine of Art. It is unusually capable
and interesting, hot too technical for the public,
but sound in its criticisms, and full of a lot of
bright stuff about local artists and musicians.
Some smart little portraits from the pen of Rupert
Hale decorate various articles.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“In the opinion of the fashionable person who
thinks everybody else is dying to get an unob
structed look at her £lOO dress, the Maddens
ought to be relegated to Siberia, at least, for
asking such a crowd of the educated un-
wealthy to their last ball. It was bad enough the
time before, but at No. 2 the pretty in-
expensive home-made frock was everywhere
in evidence. Numerous family parties met
together and arranged their dances before the
band struck up. Many amatory couples found
the cosy fires in the drawing-rooms more attrac-
tive, and settled themselves down to a night’s
flirtation on the plea that the ballroom had grown
too small for dancing. The special dance for the
21 debutantes was the showpiece of the night.
The fair Sylvia was nice enough to lend her be-
trothed frequently through the night to forlorn
wallflowers and sit herself, a study in pink, all
forlorn upon the platform, while her sister Ruby
flashed about like a star in silver-spangled black
net.
“Fun, wild and uproarious, for those on the
top steps, struggling as sheep in a pen for those
lower down, laughter, threats, groans, reproaches,
and over all the hoarse voices of the orderlies
roaring to the drivers, was the lively order of
things at the getting-away from the Maddens’
ball. All the cabs in Melbourne seemed to have
got muddled up in the drive. The rain came
down in torrents from 7 p.m. till 2 a.m., and so
the economical tram was not in requisition, and
every family had ordered its cab for the same
hour. From 1 till 3 this went on, and, but for the
orderlies seizing frightened ladies and bundling
them pell-mell into any cab that came first, every-
one would have been there until the milk came
round in the morning.
“ Melb. fashionable society has its last new
clothes upon its train. It can’t go to the simplest
entertainment without arraying itself like Solomon
proceeding to the Temple. The other n l&ct a
little play was being done at Christ Church Sun-
day-schoolroom, South Yarra, for the benefit of
some one of its charities. Toorak came down like
the Assyrian, gleaming in ‘ purple and gold
satins rustled, jewels flashed, and the feathers
of the elderly society dames waved over
their puffed-out hair as they caught the
draughts from the different doors. Which
all looked very funny against the whitewashed
walls, wooden rafters and bare boards, and made
a special object-lesson for the little gaping Sunday-
schools who stood up at the back. In the very
first seat, like a stolid rebuke to modern fr ppery,
sat the white-haired mother of a very fashionable
family, in a voluminous black cloak and a goodly-
sized black bonnet ; and then Canon Tucker
wandered in, in his old coat, and seemed thankful
that at least one person hadn’t put his shabbiness
to the blush. ‘ A Cup of Tea,’ chief parts taken
by Mrs. Alfred Cornish and Col. Bingham, went
smartly enough for a bigger public. Mrs. Cornish
was such a vision of grace one could even under-
stand her stage-husband forgiving her tantrums.
“ The cycling gusher for a Melb. daily says : -
‘ A friend of mine, who probably does more
cycling than any other lady in Victoria, told me
recently that within the last couple of years she
has been able to wear shoes and gloves nearly a
size smaller than before she took to the wheel.’
Plump girls of the biking persuasion are ad-
vised to view this paragraph in all its bearings.
If the wheeliste in question has so reduc' d the
flesh on her hands and feet, how much has she re-
duced her chest and hips measurements ? A good
many of the present scribe’s lady friends have
hiked their extremities two or three sizes smaller
through anaemia.
“ At a recent meeting of the Melb. Women’s
Hospital Committee, the appointment of ‘ En-
gineer ’ was considered. The choice fell upon a
comparative ancient of 54 years, and when he re-
tired, humbly bowing, Mrs. Thornley pronounced
him a ‘nice old chap,’ and another dame said he
had such a ‘nice old face,’ and yet another that
he was ‘ all the better for being old.’ The ‘ En-
gineer ’ who had possibly been thinking of getting
his hair dyed, no doubt reflects that there are some
circumstances in which length of years counts for
righteousness. In a woman’s hospital job, for in-
stance.
“ A Melb. restaurant was some time ago refitted
at much expense, but to the horror of the pro-
prietor, the attendance began to wane instead of
expanding. At last, the mystery was explained.
The new electric-lights used were very powerful
and not artistically shaded, and their radiance
gave away the ‘ make-up ’ of every woman in the
room. Nothing short of an actress, and a care-
fully decorated actress, anyway, could appear to
advantage in the tell-tale glare.
“ Cartwright’s daughter, Edith Morley, nas
been under an operation, to have removed from
her face the asphalt which got embedded beneath
her fair skin through her horse accident in Syd-
ney. The operation has been successful, and
Edith is no longer in danger of being perpetually
patched, like a Georgian belle.
“ A parcel of new, or nearly new, dance music
from Allan and co. is weak in waltzes, but strong
in‘square’ pieces. The ‘lrresistible Lancers’
(Alfred Lee) introduce sundry classical airs from
the ’alls at opportune moments, and are full of go.
Likewise the ‘ Vivacity Lancers ’ (Theo. Bonheur)
deserve their name. The waltzes to hand are,
alas ! wanting in soul and backbone—they belong
to the class of music that one composes in one’s
head whilst riding on a tram-dummy. ‘ Allons
Nous ’ is, perhaps, the best of them, though Bon-
heur’s ‘Continental,’ which has a bright air or
two, compares favorably with a lot of last season’s
goods.
Yours affectionately,
GOULI-GOULI.

The Reid Govt, has provided 50 pairs
blankets for the poor of Petersham, for which
Curly Jones stands in the N.S.W. Ministerial in-
terest. In a word, just before the general elec-
tion, the Ministry sends to Petersham a bribe of
blankets in order to help Jones’ return. But
what a brutal insult! A mere hundred bla- kets
offered as tjie.price of such a deed as the •eturn
of Jones ! Such an affront, offered to a respect-
able, self-respecting electorate like Petersham,
can surely be only wiped out in Blood ! The Bul-
letin wouldn’t return Jones, or Alfred Allen, or
Knapp, or Ghould, or Brunker, or anybody like
that for 5000 pairs of blanky blankets.

A Queensland Labor-member struck out
on a new taek, the other day, by attending a
Government House levee.
Sons of three N.S.W. Chief-Justices
reached the Bench of that province—Forbes and
Dowling the District Court Bench, and M. H.
Stephen the Supreme.
Rev. W. Egiinton, aged 80, died in Bris-
bane, the other day. He was a railway man in
England before he took to the cloth, and it is
claimed that he originated the staff system.
James Crotty, the mining speculator whose
will has created so much surprise, is said to be the
son of a corset-maker in Dublin. Both his father
and brother are stated to have been in that
business.
Her daring “Woman Who Did” experi-

“Diamond” Brown, the architect, so well
known in Melbourne in his days of abounding
prosperity, and later on in Sydney, is now a
familiar figure in Hobart. D.B. built the Theatre
Royal, Melbourne.
Melb. tramway secretary Sprigg, whose
liberal ideas of treatment of employes are now
amazing the Melb. Oomniissic n, is brother of
Premier Sprigg of the Cape. The Premier begun
life at Capetown as a greengrocer. A “ sprig ”of
Democracy.
An Irish-American paper lately included
P. O. Fysh, Tasmania’s Treasurer, among a list of
successful Irishman abroad. His name figured as
“ Fatrick O’Fysh.” And an English provincial
paper lately spoke of Tasmania's Premier as
Edward Bradawl.
Gov. Lamington went exploring a little
“on his own ’’ on his recent Papuan visit, and
came upon three natives who knew not Maegregor
nor the Hetnpire. Result: Raised spears, much
yabber by native policeman attending his Ex.,
and graceful retreat to boat.
Gladstone’s sublime faith in the House of
Lords is evinced by his understood wish that his
grandson is to become Lord Liverpool, on attain-
ing majority. For this, greatly to the chagrin of
the family at large, all the estate is massed, to
secure the income of a lordling.
Director Holtze, of Adelaide Botanical
Gardens, is one of the most cosmopolitan person-
ages in Australia. His father was a Hanoverian,
his mother a Frenchwoman, and his grandmother
a Spaniard. He married a Russian, and his
daughter has wedded a Welshman.
“Vandal,” to The Bulletin: Names
count for little now-a-days. Had it been a son of
the American Bayard who performed the feat
of blocking the channel at Santiago, the name
would have seemed in keeping with the deed.
Had it been an incident of fiction told by Clark
Russell, the hero of it would have been a Rodney
or a Collingvvood. But such an impossible name
as Hobson, perilously near to the ’umble grocery-
man Hobbs, of the Fauntleroy yarn, would have
utterly destroyed the dramatic touches of the
story.
A recent Melb. Police-court case disco-
vered an astonishing person, who swore he had
not been in Melbourne city for 30 years, though he
lived in the suburb of Fitzroy. Had never had
any occasion to make the daring expedition, ho
said, and wasn't going to take any chances with
the gentleman whose rich uncle had just died in
Fiji. A year or two back there died in West
Melb. an old Irishman who had not, since his
arrival 37 years before, been east of Queen-street,
except every Sunday as far as Lonsdale-street to
church.
Dear Bulletin.—Why so dolorous in your
9th of July par about Victor Daley and his photo ?
Why the insinuation that the latter is the picture
of Woe ? In one part of this issue we are favored
with a one-third column item quite in the snivel-
some vein of a Methody in memoriam, and over a
page or two we find this same sorrow-stained
V.J.D. chortling hilariously, and cavorting like a
colt all up and down a couple of columns of wild
comedy. No doubt Daley has had his allowance
of undrownable cares, possibly a care or two over,
but he is a humorist and can wear them jauntily.
The book ! Yes, but that is not the whole Daley
—there is another phase of him, a phase I and
others would like to see published in a volume of
rollicking rhyme. Daley has no more reason to be
ashamed of his laughter than of his tears.—E.D.
In. spite of electric frogs and glasses of
water, Dr. Maloney is thought to have a good
chance of capturing a Melb. City Council seat at
the coming election. He will no doubt succeed,
if elected, in keeping the minimum-wage question
prominently before the public, and the City
Council meetings will not be unproductive of
press-copy, at any rate, during his term of office.
Purves, Q.C., was obviously “ pulling the
leg ” of Orange organisations at the Melb. Town
Hall “ Twelfth ” celebration. All James’s re-
marks indicated that he had his tongue in lus
capacious cheek, and his eagerly-anticipated
speech, expected to knock the stuffing out of the
true believers, turned out to be a mere string of
Federation anecdotes with no bearing on Dutch
Billy at all.
A Melb. identity writes that none of the
street nomenclature, within the square mile of the
city proper, has any reference to Queen 'Victoria.
The streets were named after she came to the
throne, but nobody knew it. Prayers went on
for King William, in the Melb. churches, until
four months after his death. The chief western
streets were named after King William and
Queen Elizabeth.
Bruce Smith was caught napping at an
election meeting, last week. He had silenced an
interrupter who claimed to be well-educated with
the remark that education did some persons more
harm than good. A little later on something re-
minded him of Socrates with a lantern looking for
an honest man. “ Lor’,” ejaculated the squashed
one, “ I always thought it was Diogenes. Just
see what education does for some people ! ”
“ King Mickey,” last monarch of his tribe
in Illawarra (N.S.W.), obtains, at the age of 70, a
warrant to have himself clothed at Government
expense for the rest of his life. The old man’s
hope was to be dressed in the cast-off garments
of some Blue-M'>l4ll l. a,in-parrot-looking cavalry
officer, bnt the sedate Brunker kicked at such a
use of martial duds. “ Mickey ” is, however, sure
of a coat and trousers for the rest of his days.
When J. C. Williamson first saw Miss Ada
Reeve and Bert Gilbert, they were acting together,
in an English provincial theatre, without any
matrimonial intentions, as far as the lady was
concerned. Williamson, anxious to fix up an
Australian engagement for the lady, suggested
that Gilbert, should come with her, and make it
their honeymoon trip. Now, possibly, the manager
feels sorry that they didn’t come to hand in an
unmarried state.
Papuan Gov. MacGregor is so enthusiastic
a philologer that lie immediately hooks-on to a
speaker of any alien tongue —bar Chinese —and is
specially delighted if the lingo happens to be the
one he is himself delving into at the time. Re-
lated of him that once, when studying Dante’s
melodious numbers on the beach, he fell into such
“rapture by the lonely shore” that he came very
near being stalked by hostile natives and in-
continently knocked upon the vice-regal head.
Mr. Joseph Co wen Syme is a leading
shareholder in Crottyland, Mount Lyell. When
Uncle David bought him out of The Age, for
£140,000, few believed that he would go one
better, in anything like a Mount Lyell. The
present writer once asked Mr. “Joe” to take
part in starting a paper. “ No,” replied Joseph,
“The Age is good enough for me. I find that
whereas it rewards us for all the money we like
to put into it, in outside ventures I always lose.”
THE POINT OF VIEW.
LADY FRIEND (to widow) : “ You must have found your husband
very trying at times, dear, didn't you?"
THE WODOW MACPHAIRSON : “ Yes, indeed —he teas an awfu’
man, and so extravagant. Do you know, he kept two
establishments—and think of the expense! ”
A brief residence among belted earls and
haughty countesses seems to have done little to
quell the naive bonhomie of a well-known Vic-
torian lady. At the opening of Parliament the
nice old thing affably shook hands wits all the
dignitaries assembled in the Council Chamber as
she passed through; and afterwards, completely
carried away by her natural pride in the occasion,
she picked a neat little boutonniere from the Par-
liamentary flower-beds, and coquettislily pinned
it in the coat of Melbourne’s bachelor politician
(Duncan Gillies), whose sphinx-like expression as
he received the unsolicited attention was a perfect
comedy to witness.
The lamented demise of “Good ’Evans”
(Gowen Evans) in England last year has brought
about more changes in Melb. Akgus staff than
people at the time could foresee. Mr. Willoughby,
although editing the paper on strictly “ London
lines,” and leaving the small details of office to
others, has thought it necessary to discontinue the
weekly “Timotheus” article. “Ithuriel,” his
successor, by no means adequately fills his shoes,
and the loss is keenly felt. Ted Cunningham,
instead of being chief of staff, now makes an able
lieutenant to the editor, while at least three
members of the staff wrestle with the sub-editing
at different periods.
Obituary : Dr. Sclioles, superintendent of
Goodna (Q.) asylum for the insane, Born at

his uncanny surroundings ; and a good “ sport.
Cassell’s “Life of Queen Victoria’’mentions
that, when Lord Normanby resigned the Victorian
Governorship, Prince Leopold was to take
it, and sounded Murray Smith,the Agent-General,
who said the people would be delighted. How-
ever, the Queen pooh-poohed the thing altogether.

Rev. ex-Premier Shirley Baker still worries
the yam-eating Tongese. He tried to heal the
religious schism over there, but his treatment has
resulted in further all-round dissension and he has
once more shaken the dust of Tonga off his boots.
He also threatens an action against the matrimom-
ally-dazed young king.
The original editors of the Melb. Labor
weekly, the Tocsin, resigned on 30th .June last on
account of the business committee having decided
to take away from them, for commercial reasons,
the censorship of advertisements which was given
to the literary staff at the inception of the paper.
They still continue, however, to contribute.

Rev. Dr. Brewster, an early Australian
identity who died lately at Capetown leaving a
personal estate valued at .£83,729, had the cheek
to bequeath £5OO for the conversion of .Tews, and
about the same sum for the conversion of the Irish
to liis own brand of Protestantism. Brewster was
an LL.D. and sat for a while on the judicial
Bench in Melbourne.
Aid. Amess, just dead at Melbourne, laid
the foundation-stone of Howard Spenselev’s Royal
Arcade, 30 years ago. He was then Mayor, but
he never forgot lie was a stonemason. That day
he made a speech, and said he didn’t know any-
thing about oratory, and hadn’t much education,
but he knew what a square day’s work was, and
that was how he got anything he had. Which
was rather a jar for Howard —who had got all he
had, including the Royal Arcade, by marrying a
rich wife.
The case of young Desailly, just given 12
months for cattle-duffing in Gippsland, recalls one
of some old-time squatters of the same name in
Riverina, who had a regular run of bad luck.
After working for years and years, and expending
about .£lOO,OOO in extensive dams, canals, &c.,
so as to make their place drought-proof, they
had about three years of dry weather without a
drop of water to moisten the dams. Of course the
inevitable evictor from the Bank took possession,
and hunted them out of house and home; but
such was the cruelty of Fate that, before they
reached the boundary-gate of the run they were
expelled from, a tremendous waterspout came
down, soaking the whole country and filling the
long-useless watercourses now lost for ever to
them.
The sum of £7BOO now
tands to the credit of the fund
or the Woolley scholarship in
Sydney University ; the prize
will be immediately thrown
open to competition. It is over
30 years since D \ Woolley’s
death (he went down with the
London, in the Bay of Biscay),
and, bit by bit, the fund has
been growing till the bequest of
Edwin Dalton brought it to its
jiresent amount. Woolley had
been an educational enthusiast
while filling a chair in Sydney
University, and, at his death,
the N.S. VV. public raised £2OOO
as a token of sympathy with his
widow. He was the originator
of the annual public examina-
tions which connect the State
schools with the University,
and are still in vogue. Woolley
and ex-Governor Bowen com-
peted for a University chair, in
Greece, on one occasion ; Wool-
ley won, but was disqualified
on the ground of being a cler-
gyman, and the after-time Aus-
tralian Governor was given the
post.
O’Hara Burke, the ex-
plorer, who died at Cooper’s
Creek, was in love with Julia
Mathews, the actress. On the
eve of his departure from Mel-
bourne he bade her farewell in
her dressing-room at the old
PrineessTheatre. “ Isthereany-
thing I can do for you,” he said, “ before I leave?”
She thought a moment, then she said : “ You
might send me in a few oysters and a small bottle
of stout from the corner shop.” And even that
did not cure him.
William Long, brother of the distinguished.
Scottish artist and himself a man of considerable
abilities, committed suicide at Alexandra (Vic.),
the other day. Narcotism appeared to be
the cause—or it may be that it was mere
nervous failure—and the jury returned the
usual “ temporary insanity ” verdict. But a par-
son up there knew better, and showed his sym-
pathy with the old cross-roads-and-stake method
of suppressing suicide by refusing to officiate at
the grave. A friend undertook the duty and
astonished the mourners by beginning with the
Church of England service and ending with self-
slaughtered Lindsay Gordon’s “Dirge” from
“ Ashtaroth,” the first verse of which runs :
With earth to earth, and dust to dust,
Ashes unto ashes go ;
Judge not; he who judgeth just,
Judgeth merciful also.
Earthly penitence hath fled,
Earthly sin hath ceased to be,
Pile the sod on heart and' head.
Miserere, do mine!
“Melb.” : Demise, this week, Hoey, who
preceded Davidson as Coroner Youl’s orderly
policeman. A cheery philosopher was Hoey. I
have dropped in upon him at the Morgue, down
among’ the dead men and women, on a hot day,
and found him with a short clay pipe, bowl down-
wards, in his mouth, while, in his shirt-sleeves, he
played the refreshing Yan Yean hose on half-a-
dozen corpses of ladies and gentlemen round the
shelves, and all he would say was, “ Business
brisk ! ”
Alex. Rawlinson, private secretary to Tas.
Gov. Gormanston, has been knighted by the Pope
because of his civility to the Cardinal and Aus-
tralian R.C. bishops at Govt. House, Hobart, in
’96, when they went to celebrate Archbishop
Murphy’s episcopal jubilee. A.R. is son of an
Anglican parson. The Gov. of Tasmania and its
Agent-General are R.C’s, and if its Premier isn’t,
his sister is. Miss Braddon went over to Rome
some years ago, and is now one of Father
Bagshawe’s most devout parishioners at Rich-
mond.
“ OH, PAPA! WHAT PBETTY THINGS!!”
John Scott, lately deceased, won /nuch of
his popularity in the early days of Queensland
through his relationship with Walter Scott, the
novelist. He was ail authority on the writings of
his great ancestor, and one of his favorite presents
to young people who attracted him was a Scott
volume in prose or verse. He was the quietest of
men, and as nearly as possible ignorant of the
game of politics. But, in his day, to be a squatter
commanded the votes of most inland constitu-
encies, and Clermont, Springsure and Leichhardt
effusively welcomed his appeal.
Ben Tillett’s final Melb. send-off—ne has
had several—was a wildly hysterical function. The
ecstatic party assembled at Spencer-street in full
force, and smothered the departing agitator with
valedictory enthusiasm. Poems were recited at
intervals, songs were chorused, speeches made,
and cheers periodically punctuated the proceed-
ings. There were lots of ladies, who vied with one
another to present Mr. Tillett with articles of
personal attire. There were gifts cf handker-
chiefs, etc., and one blushing matron came along
with “a beautifully embroidered nightshirt.”
“Q.” : I recall the late David Henry serv-
ing his four years for embracery in Melb. gaoL
He was allotted the “soft ” billet of hospital dis-
penser, and in that capacity managed tolerably
well under the medical officer’s supervision. His
prison-life made him very “fatand jolly,” although
his health was all the time supposed to be broken.
He had better luck than the Abrahams, for his
term was shortened on the plea of shattered con-
stitution. A fair knowledge of and slight skill in
fencing I owe to David’s tuition during this period.
He was an adept with the single-stick and rapier,
and was also very ingenious in contriving fanciful
designs in paper, and beguiled his plentiful leisure
in that occupation. Taking him all round, in or
out of gaol, he was a genial old man. But he
separated business and sentiment relentlessly,
never allowing personal gratitude to temper com-
mercial greed.
To the fate of bushranger Hall the veteran
Captain Battye—in his early days a page of honor
to Queen Adelaide —who died last week at North
Sydney, used frequently to refer with regret.
Battye was, in the Gardiner days, police superin-
tendent in the West, and sometimes for a week
together hardly left his horse’s back in pursuit of
one or another of the gang. Hall was originally a
sort of squatter and a personal acquaintance of
Battye before he took to evil courses. Good
nature first brought him into association with
Gardiner, Dunn and others, and when, later on,
he espoused their style of life, he every now and
then repented and endeavored to turn back.
Finally, in one of these fits of repentance, he went
to a friend with whom he had deposited over
.£lOOO and, stating that he intended to clear out
of the country and live honestly, requested his
money back. The friend pretended to get it
ready, detained Hall over night, apprised the
police of where he was camped, and got them to
shoot him as he emerged from the door next
morning. Thirty-four slugs were found in his
body. And Hall’s “ friend ” received half the
reward—£soo.

Re the influx of Chinese into Queensland :
*' I saw twenty-eight live and three dead Chinese,”
writes a Northern traveller, “between Avon Downs
and Brunette Downs. The first I found dead was
a Chinese boy—dead in the gidya, from fever and
cold. At Conolly’s Lagoon, while looking for
wood in the dark, I stumbled over a dead China-
man in a dungaree suit—no swag. Probably lost
his road, wandered about, and died. I expect to
find more dead on my return journey.” Grim
enough, isn’t it ? Northern Territory Chows must
be pretty hard-up when they’ll risk all this. It
takes a lot to make John go exploring on his own
account.

“Werrimee” : Noticed lately that a sow
and her litter were very restless on cold mornings
running to and fro between the blacks’ camp
and the wood-heap, squealing all the time. I
watched, and soon noticed that when two gins
came over according to custom after sunrise to
make a fire at the wood-heap, the four squealing
pigs met and followed them back, and as soon as
the fire was made gathered around it with much
appreciative grunting. Piggy’s head is screwed
on the right way.

The snake-yarn, the bunyip legend, and
the tick-lie have had their day—to say nothing of
the rabbit mendacity and other trifles. The pig
is having a turn now in the North. Cooktown
paper tells how a small white Berkshire pig fol-
lowed a milk-cart from Killarney to Cooktown,
accompanied its owner on his rounds, and then re-
turned trotting close behind—a distance of 30
miles. The plucky grunter was only a little foot-
sore. Perhaps this anecdote may stir up a few
similar reminiscences of porcine feats in country
districts. The pork-Ananias is invited to send
along his best pig-inaccuracy forthwith.

Dear Bulletin. — Re your par. about
German Charley. Two days after his death a lusty
young fellow came to Bedouin and said that
Charley was to be envied, and that he thought he
would hurry up and go after him. We all thought
he was fooling, but one day we heardjthe report of
a gun just outside, and when we went to see who
was crow-shooting we found him lying with his
brains blown out. Only the previous day he had
seen a cartoon in Bulletin showing man with gun-
muzzle in mouth, fishing-line attached to trigger,
and bait in water. He said it was a good idea
where there was a waterhole handy.—J.W.

“X.Z.” : There had been a wedding. We
were all pretty mellow, and, late at night, we
gathered on the verandah, and began to give
imitations of various animals. One stentorian
auctioneer s crowing was so life-like that it started
ail the roosters for chains round. He silenced
tnem all but one—by sheer, persistency. Then
matters became serious. The rooster was as hoarse
as a crow, and our man was red in the face.

“0.P.”, Met a swaggie once near Piney
Ridge, Corowa district, with, about 301 b. of
grass, earth, and stones in a bag. Souvenir
from bushranger Morgan’s grave, near Wangar-

attached to stick passed through the drum for
axle. Reckoned he had a mission to “ roll ” the

to Bucking Jenny ” (Buckingingi). “ ’Struth !

carried half-a-dozen small swags hung all over

“Maginnis”: Re swaggies and tobacco;
met one on Liverpool range once, and, in response
to the usual request for baccy, gave him a hunlc
on my tramp’s plug, whereupon, taking a huge
wad out of his hollow molar, he placed therein the
pjece 1 had given him. Then he wrapped the
dislodged piece in paper and placed that in the
lining of his hat. Next selected another screw of
paper, of which there were several, from same
hiding-place, and filled an old clay with the con-
tents (which had already been chewed). Finally
rolled up the ashes from his pipe and stowed that
away with the rest in his hat. “ Yer see, boss,”
said he ; first I chews it, then I smokes it, and
arter that I snuffs it. That’s perlitical economy,
am tit ? Good-day, boss.”

Mac Merino was coming down from his
station, t’other day, bearing with him a small
bottle containing what he believed to be the eggs
and half-developed specimens of the youthful tick.
Lncountered two frisky commercials on the train
in whom he confided his mission to the nearest
tick-expert. Showed his bottle also. Whisky
was freely imbibed that night by the party, and
the bagmen finally put Mac Merino to bed. That
doughty squatter sent in his bottle of vermin to
the scientist next day, and had the satisfaction of
nndmg a little later that the specialist had adju-
dicated thereupon and pronounced his specimens to
b q common fleas. There’s no joke too mean for a

“L.G.W.”; The city takes at least some
care that its residents shall not promiscuously
swallow diseased meat. But in the country 1 Let
me illustrate. _ A beast was “down ” for a week
so they killed it, and, as the uppermost side wasn’t
bruised, it was sent to the house kitchen ; but the
underneath side, which was of a gorgeous purple
was sent to be used in the hut. “At once ! ” was
the order, which was reasonable, for it would not
jjfve kept 24 hours. Why did the men eat the
filth ? Well, when there’s nothing else to eat on
top of a hard day’s graft—what then? Also
when a cancerous cow died—half for the pigs, half
for the hut!

“Ever see ‘Georgie Porgie’

’E won’t look at bait, but he’d take

that thear black fin cuttin’ in ’n’

Two young fellows were out shooting
lately down the N.S.W. South Coast, and about
dusk discovered a bees’-nest in a very big tree. As
it was on private property, they waited till dark
before setting to work to fall it. All night they
pegged away laboriously, and a little after day-
break, just when they were able to see the bees
buzzing in and out of the nest, the tree fell. The
reward for their night’s labor was a very dead
possum and an attendant swarm of blowflies !
Neither of them will associate now with a fool of a
cove that doesn’t know a bee from a blowfly.

had a Timor stallion who spent some pleasant
moments, when time hung heavy on his shoulders,
in annoying the ram by giving him a gentle run
round the paddock for exercise. The ram was fat
and disliked running, so one day, while the pony
vvas grazing with his hindquarters to the ram,
the latter put his head down, charged, and broke
tlm pony’s hind leg just above the fetlock. He
had to be shot, and after that the ram never
moved out of a walk.

When Croydon (N.Q.) was passing through
the usual experiences of the out-of-the-way, over-
rusted goldfield—typhoid fever and ague, lashin’s
of grog, and no flour—a gentleman who had put
in pegs in that country from which they are never
shifted had been duly nailed up. When his health
had been drunk several times he was dumped into
a spring-cart, and the procession, consisting of a
goodly array of horsemen, started for a spot a
couple of miles away that had been fixed upon
for the planting. A good-sized chunk of the tail
of the procesh stopped several times while getting
through the town to refresh itself, galloping after
the corpse after each halt. Two of the tail were
followed by their respective kangaroo dogs, and a
discussion arose as to the merits of the canines,
ending in the making of a match for <£s. Both
dogs to be sighted on a kangaroo, and the puller-
down to win ; to be decided on the following
Sunday. A little further on the horse attached
to the temporary hearse, proceeding at the ortho-
dox funereal pace, walked clean over the top of a
wallaby, and the marsupial, gathering himself
together, sprinted for the top of the ridge. “There
you are,” shouted Bill, “ have it out now.”
“ Right,” said Jim ; “ sool him, Spieler! ” “Sool
him, Fairy ! ” yelled Bill, and the dog and slut
started in a fair run, with the refreshed portion
of the procession full pelt after them. The staider
portion near the cart stood it until the wallaby
disappeared over the ridge, then, to a man, they
broke away and followed full cry. Now the driver
of the cart was only human, and a somewhat
whiskied human at that, so, with a cry of “old
Tom” —meaning the corpse —“and me must be
in this ! ” he wheeled the horse for the ridge and
flogged him into a gallop, adjuring his defunct
companion as he went “not to fall out of the
b’anky cart!” But when the cart arrived at
the top of the ridge, and the driver was franti-
cally offering 5 to 1 on Spieler (apparently to
“ old Tom ”), the rest of the procession with most
of its head down was returning, having failed to
kill. Then a very dejected funeral went silently
upon its way.

S.C. : In the old coaching days on the
Dunstan (M.L.), both passengers and their be-
longings were weighed. Sometimes the tariff was
as high as Is. a lb., so that stores on the diggings
used to fetch fabulous prices. Passengers’ packs
would be weighed first (there was never any furni-
ture ; that used to be made out of anything they
could find when they got their tents up). Next
the parents, then the children ; if the latter were
small they used to stand them on the scale two or
three at a time. Once a lady, under the impres-
sion that only goods were weighed, smuggled two
bathbricks (for knife-cleaning) into her pockets,
but they weighed her as she stood, and, just as the
weights were being adjusted, she sadly brought
out and flung down one brick at a time amidst
much laughter.

He was a wrinkled old whaler with two

“Gordon Downs”: Be blacks’ corpse-
planting customs. On Peak Downs, the small
“ Combo Combo ” tribe always smoothed the top
of the grave, and watched it carefully for tracks—
saying the deceased spirit had gone away in the
shape of the animal whose track was first seen on
the grave. In those days (’77 to ’80) it was mostly
wallaby. One night, hearing of a “planting,” I
went down and invented a track—a cross between
a kangaroo’s and an eagle’s. The old gin came
in the morning to look, and one glance was
enough —in ten minutes the tribe was on the
travel. I asked why, and was told “ Debbil-debbil
sit down.”
“Long-’Un”: Met a hard case
on the West Coast some time back; son
of a lately-deceased and wealthy squat-
ter ; educated in England, and sent out
here for experience. Inherited J 21300 a
year ; bought camels and whips of whisky
and started exploring and prospecting a
long way inland. Breaking-in a young
camel, the latter got him down, and
broke his leg above the ankle in two
places. Taken to nearest station ;
manager away. Rouseabout set his leg—
one bone all right, other one overlapping,
making one leg shorter than other. Drank
all the whisky in the place. Got up in
a fortnight, and rode his camel into the
Bay (200 miles) ; got a couple of cases of
“Scotch,” and then journeyed 180 miles
to an old friend’s station. The “ boss ”
was away, so the “ missus” took charge
of the D.O.L. after he’d finished one
case, at the rate of two bottles a day.
He soon worked out the claim, how-
ever ; then got his camel brought in,
and rode into the Bay to order stores for
another expedition. Spent .£5O at the
pub. in three days ; then they packed him
off by water to town, and hospital, to
have the bones re-set. He polished off
all the whisky and beer on board before
half the voyage was done. The leg was
never re-set, and now he’s back in his old
haunts with his old pals —the camels and
the whisky!

A selector was startled, the other
day, as he was ploughing, by a young
Irish woman—a neighbor’s wife and fresh
from the Ould Sod —jumping over the
fence and rushing frantically towards

devil’s after me for marrying a Protes-
tant.” When the astounded cocky went
to investigate he found a monstrous
“gohanna” in possession of the family
hearth.
The craving for a “ stiddy job ” is not a
common Australian characteristic, but it stood
between Hannibal Rowe and a fortune at Fryer’s
Creek, near Castlemaine (Vic.), about 20 years
ago. Rowe was one of four brothers, who opened
up a claim on the creek, and took out so much
gold in a quiet way that, as soon as some city
mining men got wind of the thing, they came
down with an offer of <£30,000. The three other
Rowes —firm believers in Bayley’s, at that time,
unspoken maxim, “Never break a good face ”
agreed to the bargain at once, but Hannibal held
off with the question, “ Whac’s to become of jne,
then ? ” In vain it was pointed out that £7500
would produce an income for life. “No fear,”
said Hannibal, “ you city sharps don’t get round
me that way. I haven’t got a trade, and I can’t
do anything else much but drive the cart from
the mine to the mill, and, if you take that away
from me, what’s to become of me, I want to
know ? ” That syndicate spent exactly six weeks

Probably the news spread quickly all around,
That a'man-child had been born some distance from
“ Plymouth Sound,”
He was not exactly born in a stable or cradled in a
manger,
But for several years he was nursed and kept out of
danger.
However, the child grew on and on,
Until he could put his own clothes on.
Thy next step was to the Eton College,
Where thou didst pick up all sorts of knowledge,
Then thou didst go through the Oxford University,
To fit thee for life both in prosperity or adversity.
And years after thou hadst put away the slate and Noah’s
Ark,
Thou wast first returned as member for Newark.
While some of the Tory members might be called ignora-
mous,
And they thought they could do just as they please,
But no ; with the Axe of thy silvery voice,
The Liberal members in the House of Commons did often
rejoice,
As thou didst cut down some of the old stubborn trees of
Tory fame,
Then thou didst begin to get thyself a great name.
One great measure was the Disestablishment of the Irish
Church,
When a few of thy followers on this Act left thee in the
lurch.
But most of the Tories belonging to the Old School,
Arrived at the conclusion that you were an old fool.
One other mistake some of us are sure thou hast made,
Although thou didst encourage the people to go in for jam
and marmalade,
The mistake we allude to was granting the grocers a
license,
In this might have been exercised far more common
sense.
Instead of the wives ordering tea in packets or a tin,
Tea was put down on the bill, but the grocer sent home a
bottle of gin.
Thy funeral was witnessed by thousands of people,
As they heard the bells toll from many a church steeple,
The crowd was vast and great in the old Westminster
Abbey,
In which were all sorts of people, both well dressed and
shabby,
And none felt thy loss more than the Queen, or the Old
London cabby,
As you see him weather-beaten, and all fat and flabby.
Into the House of Lords thou hast often been ushered in
by the Black Rod,
Thy spirit has now been ushered into the presence of
Almighty God.
Thy name which was known as “ William Ewart Glad-
stone,”
Will be carved upon many a block of wood or stone.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Want at Wool-
lalira : .
A lie which was half the truth was the blankest he ot
all These gentlemen had said he made certain speeches.
So he did They cut certain parts of his speedties out ,
but they had not the candor and fairness to tell the
people that in every one of those speeches made in con
neetion with these gimcrack proposals he pointed out i
the same breath that he was m favor of a fair and honest
Federation. That was their story about him an
anti-Federalist.
Just so ! Certainly ! And here, in his famous
speech in N.S.W. Legislative Council, is exactly
how Mr. Want pointed it out, and his own defi-
nition of a “ fair and honest Federation .
I think it only right I should say that, as one of the
recognised opponents—l might almost say the arch-
destroying angel— of Federation, I feel deeply indebted
to the hon. and learned member . . . these wronv-think-
in<>- enthusiasts who are trying to force Federation down
our throats. ... I, as well as others, had always pro-
nounced myself an anti-Federationist pure and simple.
... I, who oppose Federation. ... He will find a
Federation of those who, having been enemies before,
will now stand shoulder to shoulder and fight, side by
side to brush away this interloper on our Constitution, to
destroy this fashionable vermin, and to leave this country
untrammelled, unfettered, free and independent, and far
above all these fal-fals of Federation which, by its proper
name, ought to be called “faderation.” . . . The greatest
intellects of this colony have always opposed measures of
this kind. . . . Now we see it (Federation) in all its nasti-
ness. ... If we could get a Federation t n which we
SHOULD HAVE THE PREPONDERATING VOICE, IN WHICH WE
SHOULD HAVE THE CONTROL OF THE REVENUES AND RAILWAYS,
AND THE CONTROL OF THE PARLIAMENTS OF THE OTHER COLO-
NIES, I WOULD be A Federationist. . . . Instead of one
flag, it will be one folly ; instead of one people, it will be
one poorhouse ; instead of one destiny, it will be one
damnation for the whole of this colony. ... Is there any-
thing in this question of Federation more than a mere
fad ? Is there anything in it but vain glory, bombast, and
trumpeting?
Jack Want’s idea of a; “ fair and honest Fede-
ration ” is only another version of the Southern
planter’s idea of Liberty—the right of every
man to wallop his own nigger.
“ The Printer’s Family consisted of ill-

It is instructive to attend a police-court

testifies thus re his little dominion : “ Population
of Thursday Island, 1287 ; police-court cases for
the year, 354; 293.” Just think!
Nearly a third of the population charged with
law-breaking. The Thursday alien hasn’t even
the poor excuse of drink, for Douglas testifies that
the local Jap., though fond of beer, rarely drinks

Ed. Bulletin. —It seems to me the
N.S.W. Public Service Board doesn't even de-
serve the faint praise you award it for routing
“ the drink push.” Many drunkards have gone,
but they were mostly 3d.-bar boozers with no
friends. When the trinity was going through one
department, a high official was locked in his room
for three days with enough grog to kill any intru-
sive snakes, and the known tipplers are still to be
reckoned by the score. The Treasury (Reid’s
dept.) has been almost untouched ; so too with
what has always been looked on as an asylum for
incapables, the Lands, where a high personage
is rumored to have said “ hands off! ” If the
P.S.B. is not a political engine, how comes it that
a list of increases, to shortly take effect, and wear-
ing a hastily-considered appearance, is published
a couple of days after the dissolution of Parlia-
ment ? And has not Reid been dangling this in-
crease before C.S’s. for weeks ? Also, as the
P.B.S. is supposed to go “on its own,” and to
make increases or deductions in the interests of
the public, how does Reid’s boasted finger-in-the
pie get there ?—Malle.
The Victorian Government seems on the
verge of making a very bad mess over the pro-
posed narrow-gauge railways. Norrow lines are
cheaper to build and cheaper to work—in theory,
anyhow. But if a lot of cheap, narrow-gauge ex-
tensions are built on to the existing broad lines,
and these extensions have no communication with
each other, each will require its own engines and
rolling-stock. Each set of engines and rolling-
stock will be stranded on its own little branch,
and will have to stay there all its life ; it can’t be
moved to another narrow-gauge line if wanted,
because of the stretch of broad-gauge railway in
between. It will have to remain where it is,
whether there is work for it or not; and it will
have to be repaired there, because it can’t run
over the broad-gauge line to the regular repairing-
shop. And the loading of goods on to the narrow-
gauge trucks, and the unloading at the junction,
and the re-loading on to the broad-gauge rolling-
stock, will mean expense and delay and aggrava-
tion, and squashed fruit, and murdered cattle, and
produce ruined by exposure and handling, and all
manner of other troubles.
Hobarb Mercury lifts up its wneezy voice
in defence of Wm. M‘Guinea’s gift to Somers
Vine and co. :
If Sir William had desired to aggrandise himself out of
native land dealings he need not have gone from Fiji to
do it, for he had all the reins in his power there. Yet he
protected the Fijians and their interests, as he has since
protected the Papuans and theirs, and his countenance
of a scheme for the expenditure of a large sum of British
capital on the island and the influx of suitable population
there is indicative of its suitableness to the surroundings.
Sir William will not. have changed his skin, though he
mav have changed his spots, and though the merchants
of Brisbane and elsewhere may see interlopers on their
supposed Tom Tiddler's Ground, in the capitalists Sir
William proposes to introduce into the island, they should
not forget that it was their pettifogging proposals which
have made the Administrator keep them at arm’s-length,
in hopes of something more favorable in its scope turning
up. And that more favorable offer he seems now to
have found to his own mature satisfaction, at any rate.
“Indicative of its suitableness to the surround-
ings,” isn’t too bad. “ Something more favorable
in its scope ”is better. M‘Guinea’s “own mature
satisfaction” is distinctly best.

“If Mr. Fitzgerald is to be taken as the mouthpiece of the Legislative Council, that body is not only impervious to any salutary reform that will bring it into touch with the people, but has made
op its mind sturdily to resist every effort in that direction; and is honest enough and candid enough to say so. That will probably mean, with the coming of federation, when most of our important
legislation has been transferred to the Commonwealth, the sweeping away of Mr. Fitzgerald himsel f".MELR AGE.

The Girl Missionary in China.
A London paper publishes the squalid, sordid
truth about the girl fanatic who goes to spread
her alleged gospel in Cliow-land :
From the first moment at which I ever gave the matter
serious thought, I had grave doubts as to the advisability
of sending single women and girls to China as missionaries.
To spread truth and civilisation, to inculcate sanitary
principles of both mind and body, is, even apart from
religious considerations, in the ideal a noble work. But
that women are fitting instruments for it, and more es-
pecially for pioneer work in the East, has always seemed
to me to be open to very serious question. Now that I
have had some practical experience, and many oppor-
tunities of learning the experience of others who have
been decades in the East, all my doubts have vanished
like mist before a gale. lam satisfied that to send single
women and delicate girls to do pioneer work in China is a
hideous sin, and those who send them are either densely
ignorant or fanatics. To grasp something of the awful-
ness of the position of a woman or girl so sent out here it
is necessary to form some idea of the untutored wayback
Chinaman’s modes of thought. In the first place, woman
holds no very high place in his respect or social economy'.
She is respected only in her child-hearing capacity, and un-
til she has produced a son she is of little account. Secondly,
a woman with natural, unbound feet is practically' in-
variably to him of low moral character —generally, in-
deed, of no moral character whatever. We cannot blink
the fact that many of our girls’ feet show no signs of
having been bound in their early youth. The coolie
naturally draws his deductions from his own erroneous
premises. Thirdly, the Chinaman, not unlike the law of
England, assumes that, given opportunity, immorality
may be at any rate suspected. When he sees missionaries
of both sexes bundle higgledy-piggledy together into a
native house-boat or junk, and travel so for perhaps
weeks together, he forms his own opinion of their rela-
tions. Under these conditions, what value can the teach-
ings of either the men or women possibly have? None—
or worse than none, I think !
* * * *
I will describe sketchily the general experiences of a
girl coming out for pioneer work on, say, the Yangtsze.
She lands in Shanghai, fresh from home, with roses on
her cheeks, a heart full of enthusiasm and determination
to do good, clean clothes, spotless linen and a skin pure,
clean and soft as velvet. At Shanghai she is put into a
bastard Chinese dress—the upper half correct, and the
lower half of the country from which she has come. She
is then taken on a river steamer, and placed in a room in
the Chinese portion of the boat. The match-board parti-
tions around the room are very' roughly put together, and
afford inadequate privacy, and practically no protection
against the fumes of opium and vile tobacco being smoked
by hundreds of men all around her. Here she begins her
first and mildest experience of the life she is going"to lead.
At first the opium and tobacco fumes cause her head to
ache violently, and make her sick and miserable. Before
long she finds the room alive with vermin of all kinds.
She is soon covered with lice from head to toe. Very
probably before she leaves the steamer her clean, pure
skin will be roughened and abrased with loathsome dis-
ease, and her bright eyes dimmed with ophthalmia.
Luckily she does not yet know enough of Chinese to un-
derstand the foul remarks made about her by' the swarm-
ing almond-eyed celestials on every side. But their
lecherous, leering looks must convey to her mind a feeling
far from pleasant. When she reaches the river port of
debarkation she is probably bundled into a junk or native
house-boat, together with her male and female com-
panions to the number of perhaps half-a-dozen. The
accommodation she will probably find to br scanty for
two and not fit for the proverbial pig. Her journey in
this boat may last days, weeks, or even months. Her
mental anguish at the end of it can be faintly
imagined, but her physical condition is simply too
awful for description tVhen she has reached her
final destination she is l..«st likely planted—literally, for
there is dirt enough in a native house—in the midst of
sanitary conditions that would give a rhinoceros typhoid
fever. And then she commences her great work.' How
utterly unfit for this she .j one can easily imagine, when
one considers her miserable physical condition, debilitated
as it must be by foul stinks, prying vermin, and ill
nourished by unaccustomed and,' perhaps, insufficient
food. Her mental state is, if possible, worse. She has
been brought up to believe that personal cleanliness and
general respect are almost as necessary to a decent life as
morality and religious belief. Of the two former here she
P° sses ses neither. Her personal condition will not bear
thou ffht, and by now she is beginning to realise that the
respect she commands among those she is sent to teach
is something represented by a minus sign. She struggles
? n through experiences that make her heartsick and turn
her hair grey. Often she would drag her festering body
and tortured mind home to rest in despair were it not for
very shame and fear of the finger of scorn that is too apt
to be pointed at the one who turns back from the plough
once grasped. Eventually she dies, and is buried in a far-
away prove, while to her friends at home a glowing ac-
count is sent of the good work she has accomplished. Or,
s ” e return s home a broken woman, consumed with bitter,
secr et shame. Or, perhaps oftenest of all, she marries a
lna^e missionary, regains respect as a wife and mother,
lal P e b’ forgets her early enthusiasm, settles down in a
' ,lore or * ess civilised place, and takes all the good things
lat conie her way. Most of her most hideous experi-
ences she conceals for very shame. And even to save
j P?*? 1- u ' ls she wdl not ex Pose herself. Often indeed
f* er debilitated body and enfeebled mind leave her a prey
• rel ,', s, u US fa . liat ' e ism, and she persuades herself that it
? s we . that trl , r ' s should go through the frightful suffer-
ln"s she herself has undergone, and so secure martyrdom.
Gne point I have not yet more than hinted at, but on
which I feel I must be more explicit. Often these girls
are alone, and utterly without protection in the midst of
lewd coolies and debauched, brutal, and almost all-
powerful soldiery. When an opportunity arises of grati-
fyhig their desire practically without risk—why, they
gratify it. And the poor girl'is powerless to resist, and
her overwhelming shame will not let her proclaim the
outrage afterwards.

Coln P>-ehends to what she is going, is reprehensible
6 noU£d }- .But to send her to it utterly ignorant of what
11 entails is,.in my opinion, a dastardly crime. I have had
men ,° . classes and stations in life married

a " usalness born of genuine emotion and
r, -hteous anger, tempered with infinite pity, of case after

v '’ ou |o ™ a he the English-speaking world, at any rate,

expression that I hear on every hand from impartial
fath er.s and brothers, who know :“ I would rather follow

And, remember, the sacrifice bears no good results,

The following interview with a Newcastle Herald reporter shows
the value the Australian press place on this remedy :
“They would almost save you from your coffin,’’ said Mrs.
Shergold, of Wilton-street, Merewether, when asked by a New-
castle Herald representative as to the genuineness of her cure from
the use of Bile Beans for Biliousness. “I shall ever be grateful,”
she added, “to the lady who advised me to try them. I had been
suffering for four or five years more than I could describe, and these
Bile Beans have cured me. lam now able to do that which I could
not think of attempting before, and I tell you, from the very bottom
of my heart, that I experienced no permanent relief until I com-
menced taking these Beans.” With this the reporter was asked to
step inside. Then it was that he was convinced of the marvellous
effect which the Bile Beans had upon the lady’s constitution. Mrs.
Shergold told her story in a way that was convincing in itself, and
she had evidently been a sufferer in the strongest sense of the term,
and so acute had grown her complaints that her father had despaired
of her life, and her husband, who is well-known as a laborer at the
Newcastle Company’s B Pit, had become aceu,-turned to finding the
poor woman ill in bed on his returning from a hard day’s work.
Now Mrs. Shergold is a standing memorial of the efficacy of Bile
Beans, and it is a pleasure for her to relate what they have done
for her. Mrs. Shergold has resided in the district for upwards of
10 years—three years in Merewether, two years in Adamstown, and
four years in Dudley, the rest of the time being spent in various
places. She is also well-known at Clarencetown, where she was
born in 1855, her father being now at Port Stephens. He, too, has,
she says, been able to enjoy life by having resorted to the use of
Bile Bean 3 for Biliousness. After realising the lady’s genuine
gratitude, the newspaper-man made inquiries into the nature of her
case, and, to use her own words, she said : “ I had been bad off and
on for nearly five years, suffering from general weakness and a bad
stomach, and for 19 years I had suffered with my head. A little
over a year ago I consulted a doctor, and he gave mo a prescription
for indigestion. This gave me no permanent relief. Then I tried
another doctor in Maitland, who said I had rheumatics in the
head. He, too, failed to do me any real good, and as month suc-
ceeded month I grew worse, and the more I tried to rest the more
tired I became. My nights were a perfect misery to me, for the
want of sleep, and when I got up in the morning I could not eat,
and on one occasion I ate next to nothing for a whole week, and
never could I take a breakfast until very late in the day, my stomach
always feeling sick when I first got up, and many a time my husband
has come home and had to prepare his own meals. I got so bad
eventually that it was not only a difficulty for me to walk, but it
was painful to even bow my head.” The newspaper-man could
hardly imagine that the lady had been such a sufferer, for to see her
to-day she looks the picture of health for one of her years. He
ventured to inquire if Bile Beans had worked this wonderful change
in her constitution, and then it was that the wholesale sincerity
of the patient was manifested. “ I commenced,” she said, “ taking
the Beans about eight months ago, at the recommendation of a lady
friend of mine. I felt a relief after the first couple of doses, and in
a short time I felt completely well: so well, in fact, that I could do
as much washing in one day as I could before in three days, and all
those disagreeable sicknesses in iny stomach left me, and those ex-
cruciating pains in my head disappeared also. I can now eat and
sleep splendidly, and it is a pleasure for me to take a walk out. My
father, Mr. Timothy Foley, of Port Stephens, who used to live a
life of pain and misery, and my husband, who suffered severely
from an internal complaint, are now quite as grateful to the makers
of Bile Beans as I am. Yes,” added Mrs. Shergold, in reply to
another question, “you are at perfect liberty to publish my testi-
mony. It’s the turuth I have told you, and while I tell the truth I
don’t care if it is placarded all over Merewether.” Mrs. Shergold
mentioned the names of many other poor sufferers who are now
grateful for having taken Bile Beans. These cases will be inquired
into. Meantime, anyone who is in doubt about the wonderful re-
cuperative power of the Beans should avail themselves of a personal
conversation with the subject of this interview.
This is an Exact Facsimile of what is possibly the largest Order
ever given in Australia for a single line.

July Ist,
Gentlemen,
Our last purchase (40,000 boxes) of Bile Beans has
been exhausted much earlier than we anticipated \ in fact,
the sale of this Proprietary Medicine has been larger and
more rapid than any other that has come under our notice.
We have now to request as early delivery as possible of
a further supply of six thousand dozen (72,000 boxes).
Our last order, when given, was considered a record-
breaker for Victoria, but the present one, representing
in value about £4,000, will probably establish an Austra-
lian record for a single purchase of a single medicine.
Yours faithfully,
A WELL-KNOWN SIGNWRITER CURED.
SEVERE SUFFERING FOR SEVEN YEARS.
DOCTORS UNABLE TO HELP HIM.
A FEW BOXES OF BILE BEANS COMPLETELY CURE HIM.
Mr. Harry P. Stewart, the well-known pictorial artist and signwriter, of No. 77 Elizabeth-street,
City, has a few words to say in praise of Bile Beans for Biliousness. Although a very
busy man, Mr. Stewart was glad to make time in which to give a special reporter particulars of his
case. We will let him speak for himself “ Seven or eight years ago, while I was living in Victoria,
I commenced to suffer severely from frequent bilious attacks. They came periodically about every
three or four weeks, and would often keep me in bed for two or three days at a time, much to my an-
noyance and the detriment of my business. These attacks were always accompanied by the usual
symptoms and effects of deranged liver. Violent headaches gave me no end of trouble. I was unable
to sleep, and my appetite was very poor. I would get up in the morning after getting little or no sleep
during the night and be utterly unable to partake of my breakfast. At lunch time I might be able to
take a little food, but in the evening I never had any inclination for dinner. While in Melbourne I
was under two first-class physicians, and while they did me some temporary relief the biliousness re-
turned shortly after, and I found myself in a worse state than ever. About this time I came to Syd-
ney, and instead of getting better, as I hoped, I continued to grow weaker and weaker every day. The
headaches became severe, especially in the back part of my head, and my heart became affected ; this
latter, I believe, was through an enlargement of the liver. My heart used to flutter in an alarming
manner, and I was greatly troubled with shortness of breath.
I became run-down and altogether dispirited ; life seemed a
burden to me, and my business suffered accordingly.
“ Now, about Bile Beans. About four months ago I, hav-
ing noticed Bile Beans pretty well advertised, thought I would
try a box just as an experiment. I went religiously through
the first box, and was quite surprised to find what a lot of good
they had done me. I continued to take them, and they have
completely cured me. I don’t look much like a bilious subject
now, do I ? I’ve taken about seven boxes all told, and there
has been a decided improvement right along. My appetite is
exceedingly good, and I can sleep like a top—why, I slept this
morning until half-past eight. -There is no doubt that Bile
Beans have completely cured me, and I have no objection to
your publishing these facts as you see fit.”

FOR
INFLUENZA AND COLDS,
Influenza is not generally understood by the greater part of those who suffer from it. It is in
reality an aggravated form of cold, supplemented by a general weakness of the whole system. _ Ordi-
nary colds, it is well-kuown, are caused by the congestion of the blood, which, as a rule, is most
prominent in the head or throat. Influenza can be traced to the same cause, and irregular or insuf-
ficient liver action is, in most cases, responsible for both. When the liver, through any derangement
of the digestive organism, ceases to act in the proper manner, a certain amount of bile finds its way
into the blood, and, at the same time, the blood created from food consumed is of a decidedly poor
quality. In this manner, the blood becomes congested, the circulation sluggish, and a cold results.
The circulation of the blood now being much slower than usual, the entire system is affected. The
nervous organism becomes unstrung, the appetite poor, and the rest disturbed. The body is extremely
susceptible to chills, and the slightest draught causes a violent attack of coughing or sneezing. Many
so-called cures for influenza fail to get at the root of the trouble, and only afford temporary relief. A
medicine that will keep the liver in thorough and regular working order, and the digestion right, will,
without doubt, prove the most effective preventive and cure for influenza and colds. This is what
Bile Beans for Biliousness will do, and we maintain that no better remedy can be found for these
ailments.

Bile Beans are not an ordinary medicine. They are manufactured in one of the best-fitted

expended in compounding them would, even if someone had the formula, exclude them from selling
them, as it is only on account of the sales being in the millions annually that they can be sold at the
low price, owing to the great oost of the ingredients.

POLITICAL
POINTS
How comes it, The Bulletin wants to
know, that no N.S.W. politician—Parkes, for in-
stance—has ever thought of fixing a general-
election for the glorious Twelfth of July ?
Premier Kingston has promised the As-
sembly that if it passes the Bill for the railway to
Innamincka (Queensland border) he will agree to
the repeal of the stock-tax on the day that it is
opened.
Should Sammy Lees bo beaten in his
attempt to enter N.S.W. Legislative Assembly
he will be re-appointed to his Upper House seat.
If Barton or R. E. O'Connor be defeated will
Premier Reid send them up again?
O'Malley, M.P., asserts that S.A. officials
summarily dismiss workmen who dare to express
obnoxious views on political questions. The
Labor-membei-s cheered this statement, but Pre-
mier Kingston declares that it is absolutely un-
true.
The pension allowances paid by N.S.W.
Govt, last year amount to .£137,743 ss. Bd. In the
year ended June, ’97, two pensions—Williams’
£ll3 6s. Bd., and Goodchap’s .£937 14s.—fell in,
and one—the Parkes Family Grant £5O0 —was
entered up.
What on earth doe' Premier Reid care
about majority rule, anyhow, when he is going to
preserve the N.S W. Nominee Council ? So long
as the N.S.W. elector is only allowed to choose
half of his own Parliament, there can be no
majority rule.
In Yic. Assembly, the other night, a peti-
tion was presented from John Robertson, Moonee
Ponds, praying the House to investigate his dis-
covery of a “general and exact scientific theory
of Right, and a natural standard of value.’’
Which was about the largest order that House
ever met with.
Q. Premier Byrnes : “ The object of the
annexation of Papua was to take possession of a
country very like Australia for purposes of settle-
ment.” Which goes to prove that a man need not
know much about geography, geology, or natural
history generally to become a shining light in
Australian politics.
Ex-Labor membei, the Rev. Smailes, when
offering himself as a politician to Granville,
N.S.W., declared that he felt a divine call to
politics as he had felt years before to preaching.
Now he steps out of the political uorld feeling,
and receiving all-round corroboration, that his call
to politics was a hollow hoax.
The N.S.W. Governor and his private
secretary are the only persons outside the Govt,
departments permitted to frank all their letters
through the post. This was a little privilege
granted by the Reid Executive to the heads of
Government House in ’95, and not notified at the
time either to Parliament or the press.
Edwin Lilley, - son of Queensland’s old
Democratic chief, Charles Lilley, is going to run
for Oxley in the Democratic interest. The name
of Lilley is something to conjure with even now,
and if son Edwin has the grit and brains of his
father, or even a little of them, he may yet prove to
be the leader that the Queensland Democracy has
so long waited for.
Reid and Barton have already met as rivals
at the ballot-box in the electorate of East Sydney.
In the first instance Reid won by 96 votes ; in the
second Barton won by 500 and in the third by 700.
These were the days when East Sydney returned
four members. In the Referendum ballot when
all N.S.W. went to the poll Barton again tri-
umphed by thousands.
Opposition-leader John Downer (S.A.)
says he doesn’t care whether or not he conies back
to politics again after the general elections, as he
has lost all the ambitions which once burned in
his breast. With a fine show of bowing cheerfully
to the inevitable, he exclaimed : —“ I would
sooner Mr. Kingston had the troubles of the Pre-
miership than I just at present! ”
Melb. Trades Hall Council proposes to
frame a political programme and organisation to
take the place of the practically defunct Labor-
party. Better hasten slowly; for a hostile Minister
of Lands inclined to read the trust-deed of the
Trades Hall land strictly is quite a possibility of
the future, with serious consequences to the
present trustees in certain events.
At Premier Reid’s Protestant Hall (Syd.)
meeting was an interjector who was able exactly
to reproduce George's unmelodious croak, and
who, every time the fat man paused for breath,
went instantly ahead with the speech in such
fashion that the audience was bewildered into a
dreadful uncertainty as to when the real Reid was
orating and when the sham. The chucking-out
was fast and furious, but Georgius Secundus was
about the last to be fired—in company with the
pleasing consciousness that he had done more to
break the Wriggler up than all the rest of the
enemy put together.
S.A. Oppositionists were badly beaten over
their no - confidence amendments. Downer’s
amendment was rejected by 19 votes, and Glynn
was in a minority by 21. When the amendment
by Glynn was first tabled there was a chance,
although remote, of a fusion with the Laborists,
but by the time the vote was taken the Opposi-
tionists were completely disorganised owing to
internal quarrels. The Kingston Ministry emerges
from the crisis stronger than ever. From the start
Premier Kingston absolutely declined to do any-
thing to propitiate the deserting Laborites, who
now begin to kick themselves.
Premier Reid’s little scheme to nobble
N.S.W. Public Service vote by yearly increments,
has only increased the Service’s resentment to Mr.
No-Yes ; more especially since he announces that
the general, clerical and professional divisions are
to share alike. A certain outcome of the scheme,
which no one believes is the Board’s own idea, will
be a return to absolute patronage for the perman-
ent heads and so indirectly to Parliamentary
influence. Under the scheme part of. the
Service will increase .£lO per annum, and to
counteract the annual increase it is feared that
promotion in any other direction will be abso-
lutely stopped. Anyway, the rank-and-file of the
civil-servants are currently supposed to be thirst-
ing for revenge on July 27.
The local road-and-bridge interest is being
urged to rise as one culvert against R. E.
O’Gonnor in (N.S.W.) electorate. The
four things most strongly urged against the Aus-
tralian-born Dick O’Connor are that he is an
Irish Roman Catholic, a disguised Orangeman
and a Freemason, and that he won’t snatch publio
money for the electorate as the old member, J. O.
Watson, does. If Dick O'Connor, who is as
straight as he is able and patriotic, does go down,
it will be the culvert that will do it. And thereby
Young will show itself about the last possibility
in the way of a mule. If his party comes on top
Dick O’Connor will be second man in the Minis-
try, and will have more bridges and culverts and
roads at his command than full private Watson
ever heard of.
The following circular, issued to Reidito
candidates, and with N.S.W. Premier Reid’s sig-
nature attached, is interesting when compared
with the Premier’s lofty and independent state-
ment which precedes it. It will be noticed that
each candidate is to write his own biography and
state in full what a noble and brainy and
patriotic character he is, and how the people
unanimously called on him to come forward and
save the country, and these things are to
be circulated at the taxpayers’ expense
under the N.S.W. free-newspaper-postage sys-
tem ! The value of these biographies, when
they appear, can therefore be fully estimated.
Also, the biographies don’t prove, as they may
seem to do, that the fame of the bush candidate
lias spread to Sydney—only that the candidate is
being pauperised by a gratis distribution of litera-
ture :
FEDERAL AND LIBERAL PARTY.

“ But I am not going to be the puppet of any
journal in the world,” declared Premier Reid at a
recent Sydney public meeting.
The stars have been fighting for Premier
Dick Seddon of late. After the downfall of ex-
Treas. Ward, King Dick’s winner, declined awhile,
and the Opposition talked joyfully of his approach-
ing downfall. Then Provi-
dence, or luck, or the cus-
sedness of inanimate ob-
jects. took a hand,
and smote the Op-
position. Its leader
was led away to
England on ur-
gent private bu-
siness. Stout
retired. His
successor, Dut-
hie, also had to
hustle off to Eu-
rope on busi-
ness. Good old
“Dismal Bill”
Rolleston, act-
ing-leaderof the
Opposition, fell
off a horse and
waslaidup. An-
other member
of the party
followed Duthie
and Russell to
Europe, and is
detained there
by illness in his
family. The
Tory member
for Mataura
went broke, and
his seat was
snatched by a
strong Ministe-
rialist, M’Nab. And,
finally, a vehicle ran into
the Government’s painfully can-
did friend, Pirani, who is more trouble-
some than the worst avowed Oppositionist,
and he is also in bed.
North Brisbane is a-weary of the two un-
speakable nobodies she elected, chiefly in a fit of
bigotry, at last election. Fraser, in particular,
has become a burden to his constituents. Dull in
the House, and duller out of it, he’s a shocking
reflection on the folks who put him in. Byrnes
himself would desperately like to win the premier
constituency again, could he only yoke himself in
with a popular partner.
The result of recent Queensland bye-elec-
tions should be sufficient to convince the Labor-
party wire-pullers that success lies in leaving
candidates an absolutely free leg, unhobbled by
any platform-signing or other superfluities. Jen-
kinson, who two months ago won Wide Bay from
the Govt., and Ryott Maughan, who did ditto
with Burnett, were distinctly running as Inde-
pendent Labor-men. In fact, neither was endorsed
by the Central Executive, and neither signed the
platform. It seems clear that capable men run-
ning as Democrats with Labor support have a far
bigger chance of ejecting the Govt, than undiluted
Labor apostles, who, being mostly fire eaters of
street-corner notoriety, disgust the philosophical
Radical.
A PROMINENT CENTRE-FORWARD.
(Football note.)
“ S.” : TnE Bulletin is hardly correct in
saying that Queensland Chief Justice Griffith
voted hi 3 salary as such. Oh no 1 Though a
member of the House, he was absent from his seat
when the second debate was in progress. When
the second reading was carried, he returned to his
place on the Ministerial bench, looking blissfully
ignorant of what had been going on. Griffith
was head of the Govt, which passed the measure
adding .£lOOO to the screw, and it was pre-arranged
that he should take the billet.
N.S.W. Opposition-leader Lyne, who is
steadily growing a policy, now declares for a
State Land Bank in addition to woman suffrage,
old-age pensions, Local Government and some
kind of Federation. Also, Lyne says that he
wants to put his abundant blucher down on the
system by which women have to work 14 to 16
hours a day while the demand for a legalised eight
hours is mostly reserved for the already better-
treated male toiler. Lyne apparently means well
in this matter, but he has picked a pretty large
grievance for a smooth-bore of his calibre to
tackle.
The Brisbane publican has banged his pint-
pot on the political counter with a loud bang in
view of the next election,
when, the Bung President
says, the publican interest
is to be felt.
HAIR CUT WHILE YOU WAIT.
O’F LANNIGAN: "Oi want me hair cut. Oi’ve to go
down the road an’ see Dooley, but Oi’ll be
back by the toime ye've finished. If Oi’m not
back when ye’ve finished cuttin’ me hair, Oi’ll
have a shave too.”
Shriek from Sydney Telegraph : “The
men who are out under the Federal Conservative
Protectionist banner are hostile to genuine Upper
House reform.” _ Barton, the head of that party,
says his idea of N.S.W. Council reform is to make
the Council like the proposed Federal Senate (the
proposed Federal Senate was to be a paid institu-
tion, elected by the province, voting as one con-
stituency, on the manhood suffrage basis.) That
apparently isn't genuine Upper House reform !
And the genuine reform of the Reid “ Liberal ”
party (a Liberal party which consists mostly of
Want, Heydon, Salomons, and the bulk of the
present obstinate Tory Council) is to preserve the
unpaid, unelected, unrepresentative Fatman
nominees, merely appointing them for a term in-
stead of for life. God bless the cause of Genuine
Reform!
One of the angry scoffs which Reid threw
at Barton and O’Connor was that, after his first
anti-Billious speech in Sydney Town Hall, they
ran after him into a room to congratulate him.
Barton replies that they didn’t run after the fat
gentleman, but that Reid sent for them and said:
‘‘l made it rather strong against the Bill, hut I
am not so far bound down now that I can’t speak
more favorably of it later on. ”
Noteworthy that in none of his speeches
does Q. Premier Byrnes pay the slightest tribute
to his predecessor, Nelson. The new Premier
prays that the past be forgotten and the future
taken as read. It is now no secret that Nelson
and Byrnes had a violent quarrel in England, and
that if Nelson had had lus way Dickson, and not
Byrnes, would now be at the head of the Cabinet.
But Tomjoe was too strong, threatened a cave—
and conquered.
Labor - member George Black wants to
know: “If Protection is to benefit the workers,
why had the workers of Victoria flocked to N.S.
Wales for a crust ? ” Well, when did they “flock,”
except in the columns of the Shoddy press ? The
only record which suggests any information is the
list of arrivals and departures overland to and
from Vic., Queensland, and S.A., all three pro-
vinces being lumped together. And in the nine
years for which statistics are available N.S.W.
received 503,378 people from these provinces, and
sent them 504,331. By way of a side issue, it is
a curious thing that when the Briton—like George
Black—flies from his country it only shows the
vigor and enterprise and spirit of adventure which
grow up under Freetrado. And if the Victorian
lights out for the goldfields of W.A. it shows that
Protection has miserably driven him out in search
of a crust. Good old crust!
J. C. Watson, who is opposing Dick
O’Connor at Young (N.S.W.), alleges that Bar-
ton, M'Millan, O’Connor, Walker, Wise, and
Abbott voted at Melbourne against the Referen-
dum and the simple majority in case of deadlocks.
But the Referendum and the simple majority in
case of deadlocks were rejected long before that ;
it was at the second Convention in Sydney that
the three-fifths majority was adopted instead of
these. And Reid, Carrnthers, and Drunker voted
for it, while Wise and Abbott didn’t —the vote ia
recorded on page 974 of the Convention Hansard
for 21st September, 1897. Also, it was Car-
ruthers who first suggested the three-fifths
majority. And now J. C. Watson and Car-
ruthers, the inventor of the three-fifths majority,
and Reid and Drunker, who supported it, are cast-
ing the odium of their own allegedly infernal de-
vice at Wise— who didn’t help it with his vote,
anyhow.
Bit of eloquence from N.S.W. Attorney-
General Want :
Mr. Barton has an army under him who are only wait-
ing to sneak in Protection.
The phrase “ to sneak in Protection” came into
N.S.W. politics in the days of th ■ Jennings-Dibbs
Ministry eleven years ago. That Ministry, which
was elected as the old kind of Freetrade or
Revenue Tariff Government, put on 5 per cent, ad
valorem duties, and the Telegraph heaped a curse
and a new phrase on it—it became known as the
Government which “sneaked in Protection.” The
two leading members of that Government were
Dibbs, now helping .Tack Want to wreck Federa-
tion as boss of the N.S.W. anti-Bill league, and
Jack Want himself 7 Barton wasn't in it. There-
fore Want, as the man who sneaked in Protection
(we have the solemn oath of his organ, the Daily
Telegraph, that it was a sneaking-id of Protec-
tion) charges Barton, who never did anything of
the kind, with his own political crime (Want’s
own organ has alleged over and over again on its
immortal oath that it was a crime). The spectacle
of Jack Want, the reliable Freetrader who sneaked
in Protection, heaving that old phrase ».t the above-
board Barton, is very beautiful.
Carruthers, of the N.S.W. God-fearing
Ministry, the author of the three-fifths majority
clause, made this bad break in a recent speech at
Rockdale :
With regard to the three-fifths majoncj, it had been
stated that Mr. Reid voted for the proposal, and now, as
Mr. Bruce Smith alleged, had the effrontery to advocate
a simple majority. He and Mr. Reid voted for Mr. Lyne’s
Referendum, but knew they were in too great a minority.
They had to get the in st. thing they could. Thev failed
to get the Referendum. Then came his (Mr. Oat ruthers’s)
amendment for the three-fifths majority, which Premier
Turner wished to make into a simple majority ; that was
only for the purpose of wrecking the whole proposal, for
the other representatives of South Australia and Tasmania
were entirely against it. The proposal of the three-fifths
clause was in order to obtain the host compromise that
could be obtained among them. They advocated «ow the
simple majority, as they desired then'.
What a beautiful mixture ! When Turner- advo-
cated rule by the bare majority it was “for the
purpose of wrecking the whole proposal ” ; when
Reid and Carruthers advocate the same thing,
it isn’t. The fact that Reid and Carruthers voted
for the three-fifths arrangement shows that they
sincerely wanted the other thing ; the fact that
Turner voted for the other thing shows his utter
want of sincerity. And Reid and Carruthers
didn’t advocate the bare majority because they
knew it was impossible. So presumably they ad-

The Diagnosis of Disease.
Without looking at the Tongue, feeling the Tulse, or any previous knowledge of the case.
Polypathy claims the freedom of accepting the good and rejecting the bad in all systems ; it has formulated
special treatment for itself in all chronic cases ; it prepares its own medicines, and applies them in the light oi
nineteenth century progress. , . .

employed, more patients treated, and more GORES made, than by any other System in the world. 29 YURA

You are earnestly invited to come, see, and examine for yourself their institution, advantages, appliances, ana
success in curing the chronic ailments of suffering humanity. .
Their patients are numbered from all parts of the world, and so remarkable has been theirjsuccessthat.one
pauses in wonder at the superior qualifications of a man who can, FROM A STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
OF THE STRUCTURE OF MAN, TELL DISEASE AT A GLANCE, WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS,
LOOKING AT THE TONGUE OR FEELING THE PULSE. .
They treat all Female Troubles by the Polypathetic Method, which does away with the speculum examination,
rings, pessaries, and all local treatment. . ,
They also desire to impress upon all men who are suffering from the errors of youth that they have the justly
celebrated Hindoo Remedy, so well and favorably known in the Old World as the “ Anti-Agnechal Tabloid Method.
All desiring to test the system will have such opportunity.

The coming election in N.S.W., following
directly,on the Federation campaign, should yield
a record in the number of votes polled. The
apathy of the average elector in asserting his
manhood at the polling-booth is one of the most
disheartening features in the government of this
country, What every man seems to need is a
sure and gentle stimulus to thought. If every
man, for instance, smoked “ Our Chief ” tobacco,
he would think with more clearness, coherence
and facility on the potentialities of “ one man one
vote. ”*
Paste it in your hat, and rejoice in the
fact that Australia has instituted sanitary legisla-
tion :
The Ravages of Tuberculosis.— The scarcity of prime
cattle in N.S. Wales suitable for trade-requirements has
the effect of raising values foranything approaching good
beef, and, as a consequence, speculators and others
anxious to thin out their stocks rush them into the mar-
ket. There is always plenty of competition for all sorts
among the various buyers, for the worst classes, provided
they pass the eye of the Government veterinary surgeon.
A case occurred last Thursday where a consignment
consisting of 40 head were yarded at Homebush to
be disposed of by public auction. The inspector,
Mr. Stanley, ordered 10 of these to be destroyed at the
yards, as, in their live state, they showed outward
developments of tuberculosis. The balance were con-
signed to the abattoirs as doubtful, without being offered
for sale, when 18 more on being slaughtered were found
to be suffering from various diseases in advanced forms.
The cattle had been purchased from different dairies by
a speculator, and although the cots were “ dry” the dis-
ease in most cases must have been seated for some time,
and it is hard to estimate how much of the milk has been
circulated.— Sydney Daily Telegraph.
Purchased from dairies by a speculator ! Hor-
rible !

OUR Animal Illustrated Brochure, “ALL ABOUT DUNLOP
TYRES FOR 1898-9,” has now been issued, and is admittedly
the finest piece of cycling literature ever issued in the colonies-
The cover design is very chaste and artistic, and is well worth
keeping for its beautiful work alone. The contents are worth
perusal, containing illustrations of the Australasian Champions ;
Hints on Touring ; Epitome of the Australian Track and Road
Season ; Australian and English Records up to the end of July,
1898; and full instructions for the management of
the whole forming a beautiful booklet that can be read with
interest by all. We invite you to send us a post-card—giving
name and address—when we will be pleased to forward you a
copy of our booklet gratis. The trouble is little, but the result
will, we are sure, be a pleasurable surprise to you.

Significant that the Riverine and N.S.W.
Border electorates have only two supporters of
the Reid Govt.—Ball, of Albury; and Lee, of Ten-
terfield ; nor has a Ministerial candidate of any
weight been nominated in any of these con-
stituencies. Most of these seats would be carried
by the Bartonites unopposed, but for the nominees
of the Labor-party. The promises of the Reid-
want Ministry of “ a speedy Federation ” don’t
count for much in the ultra-Federal districts.
THE BOBBY AND THE BATON.
It’s mooted in the lobbies
Whether all the stalwart Bobbies
Will vote for Reid or Barton —
For Barton or for Reid.
For the Reidites say, “ The devil 1
The poll will be so level
That the man they set their heart on
Will likely have a lead.”
But the Bobbies, while patrolling,
Have their optics on the polling,
And they whisper, “ Sure and sartin,
We are all of us agreed.
For we calculate with fervor
That our trusty life-preserver
Is ‘ Baton,’ always ‘ Baton,’
We don’t lean upon a Reid.”

N.S.W. Wheelmen League’s Road-race last

and Dunlop Tyres. J. Elliott, on a Swift, won first place ;

Seventy-three more Japs reached the
Japanese settlement of Thursday Island last week
—including nine “ women.” Q. Leg. Council Pres.
Nelson’s (salary, £lOOO a year) yarn about the
stoppage of immigration is branded fictitious every
Jap mail-boat; and Premier Byrnes, who drank
success to the Jap line of steamers, doesn’t seem
the man to mend things.
Sixteen consuls, most of them representing
European countries, celebrated, by handshakings
and joyous chatter at Biard d’Aunet’s in Sydney
last week, the anniversary of the taking of the
Bastille. Yet, when the Bastille fell, the repre-
sentatives of the monarchies and empires now so
gracious howled execrations or loaded up with
shot and shell to resist the new force.
When they hit Premier Reid with an
ancient egg, the other night (on the similia simili-
bus principle), Jollyanfat, to make the best of the
situation, observed that bad eggs became good in
the course of their flight towards him. Very likely :
even a rotten egg changes its principles, turns its
coat, as it were, in the presence of Wriggler No-
Yes. Wriggling is a contagious disease.
S.A. Labor M’sP. brought one charge
against the Kingston Govt, which was certainly
justified. Premier Kingston appointed the Board
of Health inspector, who is compelled to travel all
over S.A. in the course of his work, to be also
Inspector of Eactories without additional salary.
The result is that the latter work is practically
neglected, and Adelaide employers snap their
fingers at the Act whioh no one has time to
enforce.
Rumors of strange horrors come from the
Queensland lazarette at Peel Island. They are
mostly the story of a girl-patient recently removed
to the Isle of Living Death, and included in her
accusation are stories of brutal language used by
officials to the sufferers under their control,
and of strange orgies and drunks, and
attempted assaults. And when due considera-
tion is given to the utter helplessness of
a leper-girl in her exile, and the strong, riotous
whisky - breath which pervades most public
affairs in Queensland, the charges look quite
enough to call for the usual hollow show of inves-
tigation. They never really investigate any bad
public stench in Queensland, but there are times
when it is advisable to look like doing it.
Apparently, one of the first results of Pre-
mier Reid’s circular inviting the Provincialist
candidates to send in their portraits and
their biographies (written by themselves, if they
like), for insertion in Sydney Daily Telegkaph
(2000 copies of the paper—paid for, pre-
sumably, out of the Patman fund—to be sent
to each candidate), is the upheaval of little
attorney Jones. Solicitor L. C. Russell Jones
is repr< se ited, in his published biography (with
photo), as having contested Petersham in ’94 “and
though there were seven other candidates he polled
as many votes as all his opponents put together.”
Which is howling bosh, for Jones got only 627
votes out of 2477, and his opponents mustered
close on 1200 votes. Then—just listen to this
shriek—“ by special invitation of Mr. Cham-
berlain, he (Jones) attended the Record
Reign celebrations in England, being treated
(Jones was treated) during his (Jones’s) stay
in London as a particularly honored guest ”
(Jones was the honored guest). Apparently it is
intended to be conveyed that Chamberlain speci-
ally sent for little Jones, of Petersham, to come
and adorn the Queen’s Jubilee. Also it is men-
tioned that Jones once met the Prince of Wales,
and that Lord Roseberry once wrote to Jones.
And yet the Reid Government had to distribute
50 pairs of blankets in this tremendous person’s
electorate to help him (Jones, the friend of Joseph
Chamberlain) to get in again. Are the Petersham
voters blackfellows—or what ?

A WORD OF CAUTION to buyers should be offered
In buying a Bicycle, as in buying anything requiring
supreme skill to produce the highest and most endur-
— ing results, remember that the influence of the mass
of makers and agents is enlisted against the leading article of its kind, and
that inducements other than the intrinsic merits of the goods themselves are
fully used to force the sale of a cheaper line. “Under the best apple tree are found
the most sticks and stones.” It makes us smile to hear the pitiful stories circulated by
our friends (?) in the trade, to injure the standing and reputation of RED BIRD Cycles.
Cyclists of common sense are not led astray by false yarns circulated by dealers. One
way to judge a cycle is by its sales. If it sells well against competition, it must be
good. If it doesn’t sell well, it isn’t worth considering. More Red Bird Special,
Red Bird No. 1, and Black Bird Cycles are sold than any three makes put
together in Australia. This says something. Why not send for list of New Models?

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Handicapped by the heaviest of going. Floater
won V.R.C. Grand Nat. Steeplechase easily with 12ist.
up—one of the best jumping performances ever regis-
tered at Flemington. The respectable Songster was
placed fourth, other top-weights in Gladstone and Doon-
diah having fallen by the way, whilst Hayseed settled his
chance by clouting one of the fences very hard.
Sturdy Pirate, who had only a “ feather” (9st.), to carry,
was sailing away in front of the field when he struck a
fence, as in the Maiden Steeple the previous Saturday,
and this time the jockey lost his seat. Pirate, seemingly,
was the one that might have beaten Floater if he had
stood up. Good judges, though, took warning by his
mistake in the Maiden event, and it wasn’t the money of
the cognoscenti which made the Ballarat’chaser first
favorite at the start.
Flemington course was so full of water last
Saturday that some people backed Floater for the sake of
his name.
Mud racing is a bad guide to “ form ” under
normal conditions, otherwise the Manifold’s horse, Way-
farer, would look certain to take a big handicap in the
spring. This big, strong bay won the mile July Handi-
cap just as he liked, beating a smart performer
in Bunyan. The victory was impressive, but it is
impossible to say how much the winner may,
or may not, have been favored by the weather. There
is plenty of negative evidence against the brilliancy of any
flat racer that can romp home through a quagmire. Many
of the fastest cattle, from Carbine downwards, have been
unable to act up to their reputations on soft ground—
ergo, the horse that appears to like mud is probably not
among the best of movers when he can hear his hoofs
rattle.
Whernside, the gigantic, failed to hump his
13st. 101 b. burden nearly to the fore in the Open Steeple-
chase, so the V.R.C. meeting passed without one win
(from eight attempts) for the Miller stable. Yet there
have been winter-times when the red-and-white jacket
couldn’t go wrong. The “glorious uncertainty” of the
Turf!
* • * *
The addition of an “ off ” day to the V.R.C.
Winter meeting was not a large individual success, but
the attendance seemed good enough, and this extra day
gave new importance to the Grand National, anyhow. A
feature of the Wednesday racing was the success of two
3 year-old sons of the imported Pilgrim’s Progress, viz.,
Bunyan and Pilgrim. Two smart geldings, these.

“Fogo”: Tom Curran has just died in Melb.
Champion pug. of Australia, in the days when he fought
with such as Joe Kitchen, Mat Hardy, Bob Fee, Black
Harry Sellars, and Jack Carstairs. Bell’s Life in Mel-
bourne, under the hands of Graham Carrick, Dick Hamil-
ton, and others, used to publish the gaudv and classical
accounts of the fights, on the London model, of the
Pierce Egan school.
* » * *
With Tom Curran passed away the last of the
old English pugs who came to Australia to pick up
shekels on the diggings. Curran is one of the few pro-
fessional scrappers who have gone through life without a
single act of brutality or blackguardism being alleged
against him, and when it is considered what a fierce light
beats upon the ring, this leaves Curran with a reputation
like a dove. On Dunolly rush Tom made his first rise and
coined money in the pub. he ran there. It was during
this tenancy that he lost his finger through splitting it on
somebody’s tooth. Old Tom Curran leaves but one son,
Bill, who has appeared in the ring—only to show that the
old man’s mantle had not fallen upon him.

Four Melbourne “bookies’ have formed a
syndicate for laying tempting odds against the Caulfield
and Melbourne Cups double—£looo to £1 first and first,
plus the “ place ” contingencies of £3OO for Ist in the
Caulfield and 2nd in the Melbourne Cup, and £2OO for a
Ist and 3rd. This introduction of a Tatt.’s sweep ele-
ment into double-event betting is a desperate attempt
on Ikey Mo’s part to weaken public demand for the Tote.
But the machine is bound to come, all the same. A lime-
light of suspicion will be turned upon certain members
of the anti-Tote crowd in the Vic. Assembly when Jack
Murray’s little Bill is next debated (in August), and some
of them, finding themselves under close observation, will
probably withdraw their support from dear old friend I.
Moses.
By the way, Tatt. is at last going to try the ex-
periment of drawing a sweep on the day of the race.
• * * •
Melbourne parsons fight the Totalisator Bill
because, they say, the legalisation of the machine is a
recognition of the betting evil—“ an adoption of the evil
by the State.” This from the institution that has recog-
nised and adopted the Devil !

Horse journalism will soon be reduced to
chronicling the silver wagers of fraudulent shop-boys
with the man in the street. Melb. Age, last Friday, pub-
lished this stirring item of sporting intelligence : “The
feature of the betting at the calling of the card of the
G.N. Steeplechase,at the Victorian Club, last evening,
was t hat £4O to i. 10 was taken Hayseed, and he was then
installed favorite at 3 to 1.”

Mr. Jos. Brown and his Northern following had
a good day out at Canterbury (Sydney), last Saturday,
when he won the double, Stewards’Mile and Canterbury

Fusilier gelding Guardsman, Marsden having the mount
on each occasion. \

Surprising the number of horses that bob up and
win a two-year-old race about Sydney, have great things
predicted for them by all hands, and then disappear and
are never heard of again. What becomes of them ? Am-
pier (by Far Niente), jvho won at Canterbury Park,
should, however, prove an exception to the rule.

There were fully 40 punters in that Sydney
tote-shop on Saturday when the police attacked, but only
15 were collared. Most of those who knew the secret
escapes got clear, and one really clever gent, got out by
grabbing a brother backer and hauling him out after the
manner of the “ tecs.” In the excitement he passed for
a plain-clothes trap, and both escaped.

The entries for the trotting events at the Dubbo
Club's meeting at Kensington, Syd., to-morrow (Friday)
are very satisfactory : Maiden Trot, 10 ; One-mile handi-
cap, 20; Free-for-all, 14 ; and Two-miles Handicap, 16.
Amongst the Free-for-all there are some old and speedy
horses Kola, Prince Harold, Silver Cloud, Syren, St.
Louis, Viva, and the returned Hattie S. ; but, if Huon
Junior is well and in the humor, his driver will be able
comfortably to look round and see them fight it out for
seen nd place.

Well-known bookmaker walking up Pitt-street

a newly-painted shop-front. “ There you are 1 What did

What an appalling thing it must be to have a
new Knight for a newspaper boss ! Here, for instance is
the opening slab from the horse-reporter’s account of
Port Augusta races: “The recent rains have so much
improved the prospects of the whole colony . . . that,
instead of going to the sister colony for the V.R.C. Grand
National meeting, I was advised by Sir Langdon Bony-
thon to take a trip to Port Augusta.” Next the police-
court youth will armonnee (and S’langdon will publish in
the ’Tiser, edited by S’langdon) that, acting on S’lang-
don’s suggestion, he attended at Vic. Square yesterday
morning with the undermentioned results.
The Appeal Committee of the M.L. Racing
Conference has just disposed of its second case. The
institution is an admirable one in every respect (writes a
Bulletin correspondent), owners standing more chance
of getting justice, if they have a good case, than they did
aforetime. Its constitution and methods: —the Confer-
ence, representing all recognised clubs, sets up a com-
mittee of three to hear appeals of owners dissatisfied with
stewards’ decisions. Substantial deposit is required, and
the objector and club can each be represented by counsel
and oall witnesses.

New Zealand Cup entry-list this year contains
eight Australian-born horses, such sires as Abercorn, Boz,
Goldsborough, Malua, and Australian Peer being repre-
sented. Dan O’Brien has four listed, including A.J.O.
Derby winner, Bob Ray, who, however, is still in Sydney.
Heritas, Peerage, and Malatua are a trio of untried
youngsters, but Dan has hopes of successfully cutting
against Yaldhurst Stead’s and other dangerous stables
next season.

At the last Grand Prix de Paris meeting
£166,362 went through the tote on the six events; of
this, £69,558 was put on Grand Prix candidates. Tote
prices are from 4s. to £2o—mostly 45., Bs., and 165.,
though. And you back a horse for a place, too, and not
merely for first past the post; but this doesn’t apply to
fancy-price tickets.

At Sydney Cricket Ground, last Saturday, City
beat Country in their fourth annual football match by 20
points to 8, but the game was much more evenly con-
tested than the difference in points would imply. Pre-
vious to this match the next fifteen seniors played a
rattling good game with the combined juniors, seniors
winning by 18 points to 16.

Victor Trumper, the young Sydney cricketer
thought so much of in England and by the Englishmen,
now figures well in the football field. Pity that so pro-
mising a cricketer should risk his career with bat and ball
by playing the dangerous game. One wrench of joint
or sinew may put up his shutters so far as first-class
cricket is concerned.

“Jimmie”: Be Sydney D.T.’s charge of bru-
tality against the Randwick footballers —two significant
facts. Randwick and University played two draws this
season, and the only players seriously hurt were three
Randwicks—Braund, Henlen, Surinam Also the most
powerful footballer in the province (John Fraser, of the
Randwicks) is the gentlest giant that ever donned a
jersey. Were it otherwise, John could slaughter the
other side by the dozen every match. The Telegraph
man’s partisanship, however, will never let him acknow-
ledge what he must know as well as anybody—viz., that
the Randwick’s success is due first to the three C.’s—con-
dition, combination, and cleverness —and only in second-
ary degree to weight and pace.

Adelaide football promises to boom at the end
of the season, owing to the evenness of the three leading
teams, who are now level. Essendon’s recent visit to

The death of “ Happy George ” Ulyett, the
other week, recalled to some people’s minds the burly
Yorkshireman’s “happy fooling” in one Australia v. Eng-
land match, played at the Melbourne 0.0. Ground long
ago—about 16 years back. Rumor said (before the visitors
took the field) that some of the pros, had accepted an in-
ducement from Ikey Mo to play loosely, and the particu-
lar looseness of Ulyett’s bowling and fielding gave some
sort of color to the rumor. It might have been due to
Beer, without crookedness aforethought ; or it might
have been that he took an extra loid of malt liquor
aboard as an apparent excuse for his absurdly bad play.
At that time he was undoubtedly the best all-round Eng-
lish cricketer when fairly on the job—a slashing bat, fine
fast bowler, and good field. Three or four of the early
Australian Elevens at ’Ome had reason to fear the Happy
One, but his brilliancy became very occasional as time
went on, and his sun sank down into the sea of Beer some
time before his rival, old man Grace, had ceased to shine.

The great Bilmartin is, apparently, not reckoned

T.D.S. : Nonsense to say that cycling forbids
drunkenness. Have had no personal experience, but

Same with horsemen.

Talk of the. progress of the bicycle! Why,
N.S.W. Collector of Customs Lockyer has just toured the
far West on a machine, making one run from Broken
Hill to Wentworth—over 200 miles of bush-track, most of
which a few years ago would have been thought im-
passable. “Ironbark ” Gibson,inspector of Crown Lands
offices, has been making the round of the far-back town-
ships similarly mounted. But the thing may be easily
overdone; already one Govt, inspector in the far West,
taking to the machine perhaps too late in life, has broken
down and been buried.

The lacrosse boom planned for Melb. in Aug.
promises to fizzle out owing to the probable defection of
S.A. lacrosseurs. Adelaide sent a team to Melb. last year,
and for that reason many players, who have to pay their

cannot be raised. Melb. visits Sydney on Aug. 13, how-
ever.

T O THE ELEOTORS OF SINGLETON.
Albert John Gould, N.S.W. Minister of Jus-
tice, is seeking re-election for Singleton. Every
man who votes for Albert John Gould will prove
by that vote that he lacks either common intelli-
gence or common humanity.
About Albert John Gould as a private person
The Bulletin knows and cares nothing. In his
public capacity as Minister of Justice he is worse
than a failure —he is an offence to just and humane
people and a scandal to the community.
Gould’s treatment of Thomas Suffield has been
marked by the same obstinate stupidity that has
marked other of his administrative acts and
omissions with which the public is acquainted.
Suffield was tried at Maitland, on Bth April, 1891,
on a charge of criminally assaulting Ann
Chambers, a servant of Thomas Croudaee, at
Lambton. There was no proof that the assault
had been committed by a man. Dr. Staple-
ton, who saw Chambers an hour after
the alleged assault, refused to swear that she had
been assaulted by a man. Dr. Harris, who saw
her two days afterwards , thought she had been
assaulted by a man—and stultified himself
by taking the responsibility of thinking
so, for the evidence on which he relied
was ludicrously insufficient. Chambers herself
told her employer, Croudaee, that she had been
assaulted by a vicious bull, which was there on
the spot ; and this bull subsequently assaulted
another woman in the same way, inflicting similar
injuries, and was shot for it. Chambers herself—to
her employer, his son, his wife, his daughter, her
fellow-servants, and Dr. Stapleton—for several
hours persisted in the story that she had been as-
saulted by a bull. Then she changed her story, and
said she had been assaulted by a man, but did not
mention his name. Later on, she said the man
was Suffield —a man of the highest character, who
had only once seen her, had never spoken to her,
and who two witnesses swore was in his room at
home at the time of the alleged assault. Cham-
bers’s story bristled with other contradictions ;
there was, against Suffield, no corroborative evi-
dence whatever ; but Judge Windeyer, as was his
habit, bullied the jury into giving a verdict for
the woman, and Suffield went to gaol for ten
years.
Section 383 of N.S.W. Criminal Law Amend-
ment Act permits Albert John Gould, “ whenever
after the conviction of a prisoner any doubt or
question arises as to his guilt,” to order an enquiry
into the case. Albert John Gould has obstinately
refused to order an enquiry into Suffield’s case.
But Suffield has on three separate occasions been
informed that his petition for release would be
favorably considered. Suffield —though eating his
heart out in gaol—has persistently declined to peti-
tion, on the ground that he is innocent; that to
sue for mercy would be construed as an admission
of guilt; and that he does not want mercy, but
justice.
If Gould believes that Suffield is guilty, why
does he offer to release him ? If Gould believes
that Suffield is innocent, why does he keep him
in gaol? If Gould has doubts as to Suffield’s
guilt, why does he not authorise the simple enquiry
permitted by law ?
Gould has been talking of Suffield recently—of
this man whom he is ready to let out of gaol, but
into whose case he will not permit enquiry. He says
that fresh evidence should be brought forward. This
is a fiction ; the Act does not demand fresh evi-
dence. But fresh evidence was brought forward.
Four affidavits containing much new evidence
were sent to the Crown Law Department, and
apparently suppressed—they have not been heard
of from the day of receipt to this ! Gould says
that R. E. O’Connor and T. M. Slattery, previous
Ministers of Justice, considered Suffield’s case,
and came to his conclusion. R. E. O’Connor
—six years ago—had not before him the facts
and the lights which Gould has before him : if he
had, he would no doubt have ordered enquiry
at once. There is nothing to show that Slattery
ever went into the case at all. In any event,
Gould cannot excuse himself by the mistakes or
neglect of his predecessors. He has fuller infor-
mation than they; and it is his duty to judge for
himself.
That Gould has reached his present conclu-
sion—in which he offers to release Suffield if
Suffield will in effect consent to relinquish all hope
of proving his innocence—in The Bulletin’s
opinion points to the conclusion that Gould is
conscious of blundering yet too obstinate to
admit his blunder.
The Bulletin repeats that, in face ,ot Albert
John Gould’s departmental record, and particu-
larly in view of his action and inaction in the
Suffield case, whoever votes to return Gould to
Parliament disgraces either his intelligence or his
humanity.

To Motherhood
Took it as a Child: Now gives
it to her own Children.
Mrs. Mabel Boulton of Brisbane, Queens-
land, lias had the following unusual and most
delightful experience :
From infancy I was weak and delicate
and grew to be anything but a robust child.
I suffered from debility, no appetite, and
the usual consequence of such complaints.
But my parents hearing of the health restor-
ing properties of
AYER’S
Sarsaparilla
procured some for me and I am happy to say
that after having taken two bottles I regained
health, vigor and good appetite and have not
been troubled ever since. I am now married,
have a family of my own, am still strong and
well, and can recommend Dr. Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla as a good family medicine.”
For constipation take Dr. Ayer’s Pills. They
promptly relieve and surely cure. Take them
with Dr. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla: one aids the other.

“K.K.” : Connection between specs and
saintliness. Weak eyes indicate weak consti-
tution. Weak constitution involves inability to
withstand attacks of- religion microbe. Result :
saintliness. Saintliness has to take to glasses
because it catches gimlet-hole cold in its eyes ;
also saints wear specs to enable them to see motes
in their brothers’ eyes, and to prevent their
brothers seeing the beams in their eyes. Like-
wise, saints wear glasses to protect their eyes from
the glare of their own haloes.
Honey-lovers will be inclined to “ sit up ”,
over the information that an article which, to all
sight, taste, and smell, is the genuine “ garden ”
may be a result of the labors, not of the bee, but
of the sugar-refiner—this on the testimony of the
Colonial Sugar Co.’s chief chemist. Even chemi-
cal analysis, it is asserted, fails to detect any dif-
ference : but, as the manufactured article can’t
be “ built ”at a commercially remunerative cost
bee-keepers have no reason to tremble.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in. walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O'Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 .years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l re-
main, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excruciating pain.
—Yours truly,

To Herr Rassmussen.
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline Blood
Pills completely cured me. Previous to taking your
Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no belter ; and I shall never regret
trying your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can
testify to. I have recommended your Alfaline Herbal
Remedies to several of my friends, who have reason to be
very grateful for it.—Yours gratefully, J. NERVIN.
A Great Cure at the Ivanhoe Mine.
Boulder City, W.A.
Mr. C. J. A. Nielsen, of the Ivanhoe Mine, writes that
the Alfaline Remedies cured him of Weak Nerves and
Rheumatism, and that he always found the remedies all
they were claimed to do, and have recommended them to
many others in the same mine, whom they never failed to
cure.
HERE, RASSMUSSEN’S
PR€SS : OPINIONS
REFERRING TO
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
Sydney Bulletin. —“ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will
prove.”
Evening News, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen has
shown us some highly complimentary testimonials, certi-
fying to important cures effected by his remedies.”
N.Z. Times, Wellington,—“Herr Rassmussen manu-
factures some excellent Blood and Nerve Remedies.”
Daily Telegraph, Launceston, Tas.—“Herr Rass-
mussen is a clever botanist.”
S.A. Register, Adelaide, S.A.—“ Herr Rassmussen’s
Press notices agree as to the skill he possesses as a
botanist, and the bona fldcs of his testimonials appear to
be well established.”
Cooktown Courier, Queensland.—“ Herr Rasmus-
sen, we are glad to say, holds the highest place in the
colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land, and the remaining colonies.”
Evening Journal, Adelaide.—“ Herr Rassmussen
has achieved a high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanic remedies.”
Sydney Truth.— “ Herr Rasmussen is sufficiently well
known not to require any additional praise from Truth.
His remedies are simply Wonderful.”
Sunday Times, Sydney. “It may not be out of
place to mention that Herr Rassmussen has now been be-
fore the public for bVef thirteen years.”
N.Z, Mail, Wellington,— “ We have among us at the
present, time one of Australia’s foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rassmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist, of
Sydney.”
Australian star, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a deputation in the
medical World of herbal science, and his name has become
known throughout New South Wales ahd Austtalia,”
HERE RASMUSSEN’S
||)ission in the Herbal World.
Herr Rasmussen has devoted his whole life to
the study of medical herbs and manufacture of
Herbal remedies, and his great mission has been
most wonderfully successful.
The great virtues of the Herr Rasmussen’s Alfa-
line Herbal Remedies are so well known that it is
quite unnecessary to say much in regard to them ;
the very fact of their having been before the pub-
lic for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so. many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented in
the History of Herbal Remedies.
Herbal Remedies are gradually pushing their
way forward, entirely taking the place of those
remedies which contain mercury, arsenic or strych-
nine.
The Australian press has fully recognised the
noble mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise
bestowed upon him from this important source has
not only been most whole-hearted, but also very
generous. Space will not permit to repeat one-
tenth of his best press notices, but few will suffice
to show the public the estimation in which Herr
Rassmussen is held by the Australian press.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common?” The •
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of testimonials to that
effect.

Dr. TARRANT,

O
Is a legally-qualified PHYSICIAN and SURGEON,
and is duly registered by the
New South Wales Government
Medical Board. Founder of and Chief Surgeon to
the Clarmont Private Hospital, and for
Sixteen Years Hon. Surgeon to the Sydney
Hospital. Dr. Tarrant has, during his recent
world-wide travels, discovered a
New Method of Healing.
This mode of treatment is absolutely free from
Mercury, and other deleterious, poisonous, or en-
slaving ingredients, maj* be stopped at any time,
need not be continued after a cure is effected, and
is unlike any other formulae formerly in use, and is
known to Dr. Tarrant alone. Hypodermic medica-
tion is limited to a few remedies, and is applicable
to a few diseases only. The administration of
drugs through the stoma’ch is also limited by the
danger of injury to the organs of digestion.
This New Method of
Treatment
on the contrary, promotes digestion, clears the
Liver and Kidneys, thus paving the way to Perfect
health. . ~ , ~
Many sufferers fear lest others should know they
are afflicted. I may assure those who confide their
secret to me that there is not the slightest risk of
exposure, and all letters are regarded as positively
confidential, and are destroyed by fire as soon
as answered, and all appliances are sent securely
sealed.
Dr. Tarrant’s Knowledge of
Special Complaints
from any cause arising, whether hereditary or
acquired, was gained by careful study and observa-
tion in the principal Hospitals of the world. Dr. TARRANT makes it a special point to eradicate thoroughly
and pleasantly every trace of disease from the system, ensuring not only permanent restoration to health,
but immunity to offspring from hereditary taint.
No man will accomplish a noble purpose, become eminent, or achieve greatness, whose nervous
system is deranged.

Complaints should consult Dr. TARRANT, who has by profound research thoroughly investigated their
origin, traced jheir deadly sources and insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest and safest method
of eradication.
Dr TARRANT is frequently consulted by patients who have been erroneously treated for Indigestion,
Liver Complaint, Bright’s Disease, Consumption, and other complaints, whose cases prove to be over-strained
nerves Many who have thus been experimented upon, fear to consult even a physician so well-knovvn and
universally respected as Dr. Tarrant, who has cured thousands, who have been thus mistreated, by advice
alone. Therefore, if you are a sufferer, write to the doctor, who will, on receipt of letter, reply cour-
teously and confidentially, naming your malady and cure. You should consult Dr. TARRANT if
you experience Dangerous Symptoms,

Neuralgia, and other complaints too numerous to mention, you should, to avoid delay, enclose that amount
in vour first letter, thus proving bona fides, and consequently ensuring immediate attention. Should Dr.
TARRANT decide that he cannot warrant a cure, or that your malady may be cured by advice alone, the
One Pound will be returned to you.

“ It has been observed,” Newcastle M.
Herald remarks, “that acute rheumatism is
more prevalent in dry than rainy weather.” Iri
wet weather the rheumatwinger hops about almost
cheerfully ; in ordinary dry weather he goes in
terror of inducing a sweat; in muggy weather he
blasphemes and throws things; but when the
damp heat comes that precedes rain, he commits
murder—if he can get about!
Vic. Labor-party held a meeting the other
day, and a motion was prepared, but not actually
submitted, to the effect that Trenwith had swelled
head and was too big for his boots, and should be
deposed from the leadership. After a long dis-
cussion, however, it was tacitly resolved, without
a division, that Trenwith’s head was only, the
natural size after all, and that he should continue
the leadership till further notice.
A Victorian beet-growing district lately
put in an exciting day and got through more pro-
fanity than a beet-growing district usually accom-
plishes in a year. The centre of the raging
cyclone was the local pub. Late at night
the boss beer-merchant was awakened out of his
sleep by a pilgrim who wanted a bed, and he went
down in a tired, partially-dressed state to let him
in. When he had fired the late arrival into a bed-
room, and fallen over the house-cat, he went back
to bed—and in the morning he discovered that
his vest, and his gold watch and chain, and a £5
note that were in the pockets thereof had. evapor-
ated. The late arrival of the previous night had
evaporated also ; nothing remained of him-but a
large blucher-mark outside the door. All that
day the police raged over the surrounding dis-
tricts, and bailed-up wanderers and overhauled
their swags, to no purpose. Blinding gusts of beer
and profanity blew all day in the pub. and
25 different inhabitants discovered exactly how
the robbery was committed in 25 totally different
ways. As the publican’s room-door had been
locked, the most feasible theory was that the
assets were snatched out of his upstairs window
with a long fishing-rod and hook, and the general
opinion was that the whisky-merchant should be
very thankful that it wasn’t his eye which went.
At last the exhausted publican went to bed, leav-
ing the missus to lock up, and as she was casting
out the last batcli of drunks a fearsome cry rent
the welkin. It came from the boss’s room, and
the crowd swarmed up the stairs to investigate.
What they found was a publican with nothing on
him save a vest, making strange, mumbling noises
in the middle of the room. When he got up to
admit the late pilgrim the previous night he had
scrambled into the vest first, and then he had
plunged round in the dark and put his day-shirt
over it. After that he had dropped back into bed
without getting out of his day-shirt, and as, of
course, he didn’t take a bath in the morning, the
vest remained there. The welkin which was rent
by his cry when he recovered the property has
since been repaired, and is now as good as new,
but the district is suffering severely from shock,
and doesn’t assimilate its beer with the old free-
dom.

Competition in Trade.
A COMPLAINT FROM DARLINGTON.
d Competition is so keen in our neighborhood,”
said Mr: John Burgess, of 58 Fry-street, Darling-
tbfi; Sydney, to a press reporter recently, “ that
firilesS 1 daii drive ffiy horse afid cart afound
I lo’se my customers, as they will not come to my
sdiop.” Mr; Burgess, it ifiusfc be explained, is a
well-known greengrocer in the locality men-
tioned. “ This being so,” he continued, “ when I
was a hopelessly bed-ridden cripple, my business
decreased extensively. I was suffering severely
from sciatica combined with hip-joint disease.
But for Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills I should still be
in bed. I have l> en an invalid for over nine years.
The cause of my great suffering was being thrown
out of a cab whilst going to Botany, the accident
being due to the defective state of the tramway
line. Falling on my side, I seriously injured my
hip. I became an inmate of Princef Alfred Hos-
pital for six months, and was at last discharged as
incurable. Since then I have had no less than
three different doctors, and they all said my case
was hopeless ; the last doctor who attended me
stated that he did not wish to visit me any longer,
as it was simply taking money out of my pocket
to put into his, without being able to afford me
the slightest relief. Sciatica then set in, with
its attendant agonising pains, first in the hip,
and then it appeared to shoot to the calf of the
leg and to the toot. I had no desire for food,
sleep was a matter of sheer impossibility, and
instead of getting better I grew gradually worse.
I could not move without the aid of crutches, and
I Was forced to take to my bed. As a drowning
ntaii clutches at a straw, I tried all sorts of patent
medicines and specifics. I might as well have
kept the money in my pocket, for none of them
did me the slightest good. I feared I was a
cripple for life, and hopelessly bed-ridden. Re-
lief, however, reached me at the eleventh hour,
and in the most unexpected manner. A lady,
residing in this neighborhood, induced me to try
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. I must
confess I regarded her advice as a forlorn hope,
but it was a fortunate and happy day when I
commenced to take these pills, for from the first
box I commenced to steadily improve. After
seven boxes of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, I was
able to get up and dress, and after the eighth box
could go to market with my horse and cart, and
afterwards serve my customers. When a man can
conscientiously state that this wonderful recovery
is due entirely to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, it
should silence sceptics and induce other sufferers
who endured the torments that I did, to give this
wonderful preparation a fair and honest trial, as
I can truly state it has succeeded in putting me on
my legs again.”
Twelve Years!
HOW THE REPORTER DROPPED IN.
There is a neat and natty grocery store at the
corner of Rathdown and Palmerston streets, Mel-
bourne, when one can always drop in for an
interesting chat with the proprietoress, Mrs.
Margaret Ross, who assists her husband in man-
aging the business. The theme upon which the
conversation frequently turns is the marvellous
recovery from neuralgia which Mrs. Ross has ex-
perienced through using Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People. A reporter dropped in at the
store recently, and to him Mrs. Ross very kindly
narrated her experience.
“ I have been a great sufferer from neuralgia for
ten or twelve years,” she said, “ but nothing re-
lieved me except Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, which alone have effected a cure.
All changes of season proved futile to arrest my
malady. During the daytime my sufferings were
painful, but on retiring to rest, the agony I
suffered was excruciating, reducing me to a state
of general collapse. I felt it during the day
slightly, but most severely at night. ”
1 ‘ Did you consult any doctors at all ? ”
“Many; but received no permanent benefit.
They gave me draughts and powders, but the
effect was really nothing.”
“ You, of course, have tried other remedies ? ”
“ Yes; I tried everything, but obtained no
relief.”
“ What induced you to try Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People ? ”
“An elderly lady, resident at Heathcote, 74
years of age, who had been a sufferer from rheu-
matism for .40 years, and who had been absolutely
cured by their use, recommended me to try the
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.”
“How long since might that be ? ”
“ Six weeks since—the beginning of July. Dur-
ing the time I was taking the first box I lost only
one night’s rest, but since then I have never had
the least return of the old complaint.”
“ Have you used much of the medicine ? ”
“About four boxes. Previous to my taking
them the pain in my head reduced me to such a
state that I was on the verge of madness. The
last three years I had been very bad, so you can
imagine the pleasure it was to me to find a remedy
that;has actually made a new woman of me.”
“ That js so,” remarked Mr. Ross, who was pre-
sent. “ Had you seen my wife a few months since
and now, you would scarcely believe her to be the
same woman.”
“Yes,” added Mrs. Ross, “my recovery has
been most pronounced and satisfactory to me. I
have great faith in Dr. Williams’Pink Pills for
Pale People, and recommend them wherever pos-
sible.” >
An Australian Authoress.
Miss Millie Finkelstein, of 51 Victoria Parade,
Melbourne, who will probably be best known as
the yOung lady on whom devolved the honor of
delivering the opening ode of West Australia’s
first theatre,'the Royal, at Perth, writes: —
“Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. Dear Sirs,—l
have several times been going to drop you a line
to tell you of the debt of gratitude I owe your
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
“ During the past 12 months I have been so-
journing in West Australia, accompanied by a
severe attack of neuralgia. I need hardly inform
you that this was a source of great annoyance to
me. I tried various remedies, but without avail,
when incidentally, a lady friend mentioned your
Pink Pills to me. As a forlorn hope, I gave them
a trial, amd was simply astonished at the beneficial
results, instant relief following.
“Should you care to make use of this testi-
monial, you are at perfect liberty to do so.—Re-
spectfully yours. Millie Finkelstein.”
An Eaglehawk Delegate.
HAS A TALE TO TELL.
I have for years been subject to dreadfu
attacks of diarrhoea,” said Mr. David Evans, of
Californian Gully, Eaglehawk, Victoria, to a
reporter, “and,” continued he, “it’s ten years
ago now since they first came upon me. I was
in Sydney at the time, working at my trade as a
tirfsmith. The attacks were so severe that they
tesulted in iny losing my employment, as my
employer stated he must secure a regular atten-
dance in his employes. I subsequently worked
at Marrickville and Summer Hill, and had again
to leave through constant absence from illness. I
attended at the Sydney Infirmary for a while,
the medical officer recommended me to try a
change of climate; so I came to Victoria, and
the change really did me good for a time. But
in last November the old complaint returned, so
I came on here in search of rest and recovery.
Still the diarrhoea continued, and I obtained no
relief until early last July.”
“ And the reason ? ”
. “ A friend of mine advised me to try Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills, and I did. After the third box
I commenced to lose all symptoms of the diarrhoea,
and by the time I was half-way through the fourth
I felt myself fairly on the way to recovery. At
the sixth, when half way through, I discontinued
taking them, and feel now as well as ever. I can-
not describe the agonies I suffered. I had a con-
tinued gripping and laxity of the bowels that
exhausted me. I had tried all other known reme-
dies without result, and I am thankful that I at
last struck Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.”
Mr. Evans is now a hale, hearty and robust man,
and no one seeing him now wouid anticipate that
he had recently gone through such a severe and
trying illness.
Auburn Anxiety.
WHAT A YOUNG LADY DESIRED.
Hearing that a young lady residing at Auburn,
who had previously been suffering from anaemia,
had tried a course of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, a reporter took his way to Mrs.
Dick’s well-known store in Parramatta - road,
Auburn. Miss Victoria Dick made her appear-
ance in a few moments and courteously received
the visitor. In response to an enquiry Miss Dick
said : “ I certainly do owe much to Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People ; I can speak with feel-
ing, for I’ve suffered for nearly seven years.
Anaemia was the principal complaint, but I often
suffered tortures from indigestion, accompanied by
sick headaches of the most violent description.
I began to look upon myself as a regular invalid,
and fancied there was no way of escape. Apart
from the pains of indigestion I seemed to have
absolutely no desire to eat, and everything
seemed tasteless to me. My mother would often
try and tempt me to eat by making dainty little
dishes, but I simply couldn’t bear the sight of
food. I used to feel great listlessness. My work
became a regular nightmare to me, as I could
hardly drag myself about. I would long for
night to come, and then long for day. lam now
twenty-three years of age; I was about sixteen
years old when my illness seemed to start, and it
went on for close on seven years. For many
nights I would hardly get any sleep, and then it
would be of the most fitful description. The pains
in my head would rack me dreadfully. I would
feel as limp as a kitten, and at times be quite
unable to stir, much less do any work. I had
plenty of medical advice, for I tried four doctors,
one after the other, but no real benefit seemed to
ensue. I swallowed quarts of medicines and tried
all sorts of remedies. My mother thinking that
perhaps a change would do me good, sent me to
Melbourne for a holiday, but it seemed of no use,
for I returned home as bad as ever. However,
about twelve months ago I gave Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People a trial, for, as I said,
they could do me no harm and perhaps might do
me some good. I procured four boxes and deter-
mined to hope for the best.”
“ And with what result ? ”
“ Well you may hardly believe it ; the very
first box gave slight relief, though at the time I
was so dispirited that I scarcely gave it the credit
it deserved. Presently I noticed my headaches
became less and less painful, the color gradually
came back to my face, and, as I persevered with
the pills, the painful symptoms slowly disappeared,
my skin was firmer, I suddenly seemed to have an
appetite—such as I had not possessed for years.
Previously I might have beeri eating sawdust for
all the taste I had, but this was soon altered ; the
dull, heavy feeling left, and I felt as if I could
run a mile, or go up and downstairs all day. As
you may imagine, I was formerly very much run-
down and most nervous and hysterical, but now
I seem to feel the life flowing through my veins ;
only those who have been ill can understand the
relief I felt at the gradual cessation of all unfavor-
able symptoms. I continued taking the pills till
I took eight boxes in all. lam confident that Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are alone responsible for my
cure. lam now in perfect health. I was recom-
mended to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People by Miss Kennerdale in this district, and
she told me they had completely cured her of a
very similar ailment. lam thankful I listened to
her kind advice.”
Aldermanic Experience.
The people of this country have good cause to
view with alarm an outbreak of influenza, as it
leaves behind it more shattered constitutions than
any other known disease. Mr. Edward Botting,
for ten years a Councillor of the united townships
of Bedford, Olden, and Palmerston, inErontenao
County, is one who nearly fell a victim to this
scourge. To a Whig correspondent Mr. Botting
said “ About two years ago I had a bad attack
of influv.'.za, and the after-effects of that malig-
nant trouble brought me so low that my friends
despaired of my recovery. I was troubled with
severe and constant pains in the back, sensations
of extreme dizziness and weakness, and was, in
fact, in a generally used-up condition. I had read
frequently of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and felt
they must have some special virtues, else they
could not obtain such strong endorsements in all
parts of the country. I determined to try them,
and I bless the day that I came to that conclusion.
Before the first box was finished I felt benefited,
and I continued their use until I was as strong as
ever. I consider Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills the
best medicine sold.
Hot Sea Baths.
PROOF OF THEIR USELESSNESS.
Mrs. C. Fairclough, wife of the proprietor of
the Carnarvon Hotel, Port Arthur, Tas., lias
passed through some of the severest sufferings
ever inflicted upon unfortunate human beings.
Rheumatism, or rheumatic gout, was her afflic-
tion, and medical science and patent medicines
were worse than nought. Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills alone succeeded in effecting once more a
remarkable and inexpensive cure.
For years, so she stated, she had been a sufferer
from rheumatic affections, which at first seemed
trivial, but in spite of ordinary precautions con-
tinued to increase so as to give rise to consider-
able alarm. The doctors pronounced the case to
be one of much severity, the complaint being
rheumatic gout. Everything was tried, but with-
out avail, and Mrs. Fairclough became at length
a pronounced invalid.
For months she was hopeless of ever recovering
the use of her limbs, and the pains which she en-
dured were absolutely beyond conception. Hot
sea baths were tried, but failed, and, in fact, she
was looked upon as a confirmed invalid.
Worrying over her illness brought on a variety
of other complaints. The least cold affected her to
an abnormal degree. She was seized with pains
in the feet so that she could hardly walk, even a
feeble effort giving her considerable pain. She
was compelled to sit in a warm place constantly,
and her appetite fell away, so that she ate but one
meal in three days. Every effort was made to
secure relief, the best medical advice procurable
being obtained. It was without avail, however,
for she, so far from getting better, grew steadily
worse.
Hearing of some of the marvellous cures effected
by the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People she decided to try them. Her husband
laughed at her decision and condemned the medi-
cine as being useless and inoperative. But, acting
on the belief that if Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills did
her no good a few could not do any harm, she
gave them a trial.
After commencing to take the pills she noticed
a decided improvement in her condition. The
pains were not so aggravated, and she could
stand without assistance, a feat which previously
she was unable to accomplish. Soon the pains
in the feet ceased altogether, and she felt like a
new woman. Delighted with the discovery which
she had made, she continued to use Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and after carefully taking them con-
tinuously according to directions for a period of
two months she felt that she had no longer any
occasion to use the medicine.
“I cannot explain to you,” Mrs. Fairclough
said, “ how grateful I am for having discovered
a cure for my complaint. I was in torture and
completely broken down with despair for my con-
dition. I felt that life was a burden, and I seemed
to be in everybody’s way by day and by night.
My husband is as grateful as myself for the cure
effected, and we both feel that I owe a new lease
of my life to the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People. I have every faith that they
have completely driven out the demon of rheu-
matic gout from my system. lam now a new
woman, and, being well and strong and hearty,
am able to perform all my duties satisfactorily.
And all is due to the use for two months of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.”

RECOLLECTIONS OF A HORTON RIVER
FARMER.
Mr. George Batchelor, a farmer on the Horton
River, N.S.W., at 59 years of age, just when his
strength would prove most valuable, became the
victim of the attacks of those enemies to life ar.d
limb —Insomnia, Nervous Debility, Despondency,
and Intense Suffering. He was rescued, however,
by Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People. The
reporter, who found him ploughing, obtained the
following particulars :
“ I think,” said Mr. Batchelor, “ my case is one
that should have all the publicity possible. lam
65 years of age, and have been resident in this dis-
trict for about 12 years. Prior to my coming
here I had always enjoyed the best of health, and
I had been accustomed to work very hard. About
six years ago, however, all my energy seemed to
gradually desert me. I suffered acutely and con-
stantly from pains in my limbs, lost my appetite,
and for months at a stretch I did not know' what
it was to get a good night’s sleep. Work of the
very lightest nature at last became beyond the
question with me, and I could do nothing but sit
by the window and content myself by watching
the others work the farm. I gave up all hope of
ever being able to do any more work, and almost
believed Jhat every week which commenced would
be my-last. In my endeavors to stay the ravages
of the ailment which had overtaken me, and was
gradually drawing me into the grave, 1 tried
innumerable so-called cures, and swallowed an
immense quantity of medical compounds, but
beyond giving me temporary relief occasionally,
none of them did me any good; in fact, I
honestly believe that the majority of them only
aggravated my sufferings. A few months back
I was just on the point of giving up in despair
when I happened to read in a newspaper of some
wonderful cures effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People, and I determined to give
them a trial. After taking the first box, I felt
considerably relieved, and so marked was the
improvement in my strength that I decided to
continue their use. I did so, and up to the pre-
sent time I have taken five boxes. My inability
has all disappeared, and I am pleased to say that
to-day I am as strong and hearty as I ever was
in my life. It is no trouble to me to do a day’s
farm work now, and I feel quite equal to the
task of walking at least thirty miles a day.
Everyone who knows me can testify to the great
cure Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have effected in
me, and in recommending them for similar cases
to mine I can honestly say that they are worth
more than their weight in gold. If everybody
knew their true value, there would be no other
medicine sold.”
“ Mount Magnet, Murchison, W.A., May 9,
1898. Dear Sirs, —I received the Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People quite safely and in
good order. I have taken two boxes myself for
rheumatism, which I have had in both my knees.
I was unable to kneel down. I have had the
rheumatism on me for over fourteen years. I feel
the pain quite gone from me now, and am as
nimble on my legs as I was twenty years ago, and
I feel like a young fellow again. I have told my
friends what your Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have
done for me, and they are now taking them. You
are at liberty to advertise this for the sake of other
Poe. sufferers.— l am, kc., H. Baldwin ”
An Ashby Anecdote.
AS TOLD IN AUTUMN-STREET.
Influenza is now rampant all over Australia,
and the greatest precautions possible should be
taken to guard against it, as one has not only to
contend with the malady itself, but with its fear-
ful and devastating after-effects. That this is so is
shown most clearly by the case of Miss Jamieson,
of Autumn-street, Ashby, Geelong, Victoria.
“Some few years ago,” she told a reporter, “I
suffered from a very severe attack of influenza. I
could never get rid of its after-effects until 1 tried
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. Al-
though generally experiencing robust health pre-
vious to this attack, when at last I was able to
leave my room I was almost of ghostly proportions
—not at all like lam now. And I continued in
this state for some time. I did not mind the
weakness so much, feeling sure that would wear off
in time with good nourishment. But, in March
of last year, I commenced to experience great
inconvenience from pains in my right side. I
consulted a medical man, who said that it was
merely the after-effects of the influenza, and I
was not to worry myself. But, as the pains
continued, I did worry myself, and went to Mel-
bourne to consult a specialist. He informed me
that it was partial paralysis. He put me through
a course of treatment that left me as I was, and I
returned home fairly worn out. Whether the
worry or the heroic treatment I had undergone
was responsible or not I will not venture an
opinion upon, but a week afterwards erysipelas
set in on my face, and for weeks and months I
suffered the greatest agony. In January a friend
(a Miss Evans, of Eaglehawk, near Bendigo)
came down to see me, and one day she bought me
a box of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. When visiting
Melbourne I took them, and four days after the
pain commenced to go away. I continued taking
them for some time, and in all I used eight boxes,
discontinuing them in August. From then until
now I have not had the least symptom of a return
of either complaints—complaints that I had not
been free from for four years. I am 22 years of
age. Scores know my sufferings, and the means of
my recovery I am only too pleased to supply.”
What Paleness Means.
A MATTER FOR THE GIRLS.
What can be more distressing than to see a girl
drooping and fading in the springtime of youth.
Instead of bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and
an elastic step, there are dull eyes, pale, yellow, or
greenish complexion, and a languidness of step
that bespeaks disease and an early death if proper
treatment is not promptly resorted to and per-
sisted in until the impoverished blood is enriched,
and the functions of life become regular.
Upon parents rests a great responsibility at
the time their daughters are budding into
womanhood. If your daughter is pale, com-
plains of weakness, is “tired out” upon the
slightest exertion; if she is troubled with head-
ache or backache, pain in the side, if her temper is
fitful and her appetite poor, she is in a condition
of extreme peril, a fit subject for the development
for the most dreaded of all diseases—Consumption.
If you notice any of the above symptoms, lose no
time in procuring Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They
will assist the patient to develop properly and
regularly; they will enrich the blood and restore
health’s roses to the cheeks; bright eyes and
lightness of step will surely follow their use, and
all danger of consumption and premature death
will be averted. Wise and prudent mothers will
insist upon their daughters taking Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills upon the approach of the period of
womanhood, and thus avoid the risks of disease
or early decay.
The Vitality of the Human
Race.
The public are offered Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
with a full confidence that there is no disease
arising from a Watery or Impoverished Condition
of the Blood, Shattered Nervous Forces, which
they will not cure if the directions are faithfully
followed, and the treatment persisted in ; they are
not a patent medicine, but are a thoroughly scien-
tific preparation, the result of years of careful
study. They have an especial action (through
the Blood) upon the Vital Organs of both Men
and Women. It is a well - recognised fact
that upon the healthy activity of the vital
apparatus depends the mental and physical
well - being _of every person come to adult
years. It is that which gives the rosy blush
to the cheek, and the soft light to the eye of the
maiden. The elastic step, the ringing laugh, and
the strong right arm of youth own this same main-
spring. How soon do irregularities rob the face
of color, the eye of brightness ! The blood be-
comes impoverished, the victim pale. The pallor
of the skin is often the only outward mark of the
trouble within. “Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People ” enrich the impoverished blood and
then vigor returns, and the bloom of youth again
mantles the faded cheek.
The Last Par.
A remarkable efficacy in curing diseases arising
from an impoverished condition of the blood or an
impairment of the nervous system, such as rheu-
matism, neuralgia, partial paralysis, locomotor
ataxia, St. Vitus’dance, nervous headache, nervous
prostration, and the tired feeling arising therefrom,
the after-effects of la grippe, influenza, and severe
colds, diseases depending on humors in the blood,
such as scrofula, chronic erysipelas, &c.,is possessed
by the only genuine Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills give a healthy glow to pale
and sallow complexions, and are a specific for
the troubles peculiar to the female system, and in
the case of men they effect a radical cure in all
cases arising from mental worry, over-work, and
excesses of any nature. These pills are not a
purgative. They are genuine only with the full
name, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
and are sold by all chemists and by Dr. Williams’
Medicine Company, Sydriey, who will forward
(post paid), on receipt of stamps or post-order
one box for 2s. 9d., or half-dozen for 15s. 3d ’
They are never sold in bulk, or by the dozen or
hundred, and any dealer who offers substitutes in
this form is trying to defraud, and should be
avoided. See that each box is encircled by a blue
warning label, and regard with distrust the man
who wants to sell you something whioh he says is
lust as good.” He only wants a bigger profit


“Premier Reid,” says a Melb.
“is much harassed by his excessive obesity.”
Humph ! girth-galled.
Thus a Melb. chiropodist:—
Beer enlarges the feet of women. It is beer-drinking
that has spoiled the feet of English and German women.
The Americans who have adopted that drink are begin-
ning to lose the beauty of their feet. French women
(especially Parisiennes) are noted for their neat, small
feet. They are great wine drinkers. So with Spanish
and Italian women. If their feet are not so small, they
are always beautifully formed. The average Australian
woman has a foot not quite so large as that of English or
German type, but then it is not so finely moulded as that
of a woman of a wine-drinking country. I speak, of
course, mainly of the fashionable division, though the
rule applies to all classes. Take a hard-working woman
who drinks beer or porter and compare her feet with
those of a Wine or spirit drinker. You will see I am
right.

Hard upon the engagement of H. H.
Champion comes news from England of
the marriage of George Bernard Shaw to Miss
Payne Townshend. After 20 years’ steady de-
nunciation of marriage, Shaw’s fall is a good score
for Cupid. But, oh ! how those anti-marriage
sentiments of Shaw’s crowd upon the memory !
For instance:
What is any respectable girl brought up to do but to
catch some rich man’s fancy and get the benefit of his
money by marrying him—as if a marriage-ceremony could
make any difference in the right or wrong of the thing !
Again: ;
The only way for a woman to provide for herself de-
cently is for her to be good to some man that can afford
to be good to her.—Mrs. Warren’s Profession.
Shaw calls that revered, respectable institution,
the Family, “ this horrible domestic institution,”
and declares that he has “no respect for popular
morality.” Ah, there was a Bernard Shaw !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hennon—he was a Yankee in the Soura-
baya arsenal—looked foolish as he answered me.
“ Well, I ought to’ve known, mister —that’s a
fact ! But I reckon I’m so much mixed up with
iron and sich, that I don’t take no stock in stone
fixin’s. Folks here calls it ‘ Godoldok,’ and out-
side that I know nothin’, ’cept that it’s ugly
enough to scare scales off an alligator ! ”
“ Godoldok ! ” The sound of the name—half-
portentous, half-laughable—suited well enough
this monstrous, cross-legged figure, with hideous
red and yellow face, and huge eyes staring, with a
cruel calm, away across the tree-tops to the
darkening Java Sea. The sinking sun touched
off with crimson edging the crude, ungraceful out-
lines, and the little grey moro-doves fluttered
gently about the insolent grotesqueness of the
head, but there was no mistaking the serene
brutality—the placid, passionless malevolence —
that marks the work of ancient Hindu hands.
“ Or Hindu-taught, at all events,” I said to
Hennon. “ Brought here, I should say, from
some of the Brahminical ruins in the interior.
But, why ? There’s a story hanging to this ; and,
if I don’t fossick it out, I’m a -—”
“ Don’t say ‘ Dutchman ’! ” Hennon chipped in.
“ It’s a phrase that don’t exactly suit the location.
And, as for the story—darn me if I can make out
how you Britishers came by a reputation for mind-
ing your own business 1 ”
“ But this is my business, friend Hennon, And,
to prove it, I’ll stick you into the story, some-
how ! ”
Which threat is here fulfilled.
• * * *
A fat, good-humored-looking old Chinaman,
with a wisp of scarlet at the end of his scanty
grey pigtail, and his blue silk baju thrown back
from his capacious yellow stomach. He took his
long bamboo-stemmed pipe from his mouth, and
twinkled at me through his silver-rimmed glasses,
but not till I had saluted him did he get up from
his stone bench to make me an elaborate bow.
“You know the Straits-Malay ? ” he asked, in
that tongue, as he waved a hand towards the seat.
“ And you know, also, the regulations ? ”
“ About salaaming to the white man ? Oh, yes \
But I don’t want any man to salute me against
his will; and, in any case, I’m not a Dutchman.”
“My son, I know it. To a Dutchman would
I have given the forced reverence his foolish law
exacts ; to you, as a stranger, I show willing
respect.”
“ But the Dutchmen say that you Chinese like
them better than the Javanese do ? ”
“Sampaada!” the old man called, and from
behind the gorgeously-flowered hanging of the
doorway came a slim, top-knotted Javani boy.
“ Cigars to the gentleman, and fire. Like them ! ”
he went on, as the lad came back with a cigar-box
and a lighted joss-stick. “We like them about
as much as Chassan here likes this,” and he coolly
thrust his glowing pipe-bowl against the. boy’s
saffron cheek. “And we haven’t, like him” —
as the unlucky urchin skipped and howled —“ the
relief of making a noise about it.”
Here was a heathen worth talking to. I lighted
a long Trajarta, and essayed a farther peep into
the dim, unsuspected recesses of the mysterious
Cathayan mind.
“ The Dutch,” I said, “ call themselves the
justest nation in the world.”
Quang-Lo sunk me at the first shot. So do
the English,” he answered, quickly. “ And, like
the Dutch, they stand alone in that opinion.’
Which is so far true that the average Briton—
getting outside his own four seas has nothing
short of moral earthquake to suffer at the dis-
covery that “ British fair-play ” is no more, to the
rest of the world, than a pleasing figment of the
British imagination.
“You don’t make us eat dirt, as these Dutch-
men do, you would say. No !—but you would if
it suited you. Every nation ” —Quang-Lo waved
his pipe round his shaven crown—“ does exactly
what agrees, not with its conscience, but with its
pocket.”
Here — ex oribus infidelium, and unpalatable,
even to me —was a truth so indisputable that I
could only feebly say, “Your Straits countrymen,
at all events, don’t appear dissatisfied with British
rule.” _ . ...
“ Why should they be, my son ? It is with acts
we have to do—not motives ; and as we Chinese
are perhaps the most constitutionally cruel race
upon earth ” —here this delightfully-candid pagan
lowered his voice—“we will show these Dutch-
men, when we some day get the better of them,
that we didn’t require any Godoldok as a re-
minder of what we owe them ! ”
“ Godoldok ! ” I repeated eagerly. “ I’ve seen
him ! What does he mean ? How did he come
there? Nobody seems to know —though I have
asked scores of people.” .
Quang-Lo arose, beckoned me within his por-
tiere, and lit a lamp that filled with rosy glow his
quaint little den—glittering with lacquer-work
and porcelain, and fragrant with sandalwood.
“Did you ask any Chinaman? ” he said, as he
put bottles on the table—with mangoes and tama-
rinds, and burly little jars of unspeakable Chinese
preserves. “ No ! Well, we remember—let. who
will forget! Choose your drink, and help your-
self.” „ , 7
He poured himself a liberal jorum of kornkum-
mel —filled his long pipe—and kept me till mid-
night listening to matters which left the Spanish
Inquisition little to boast of. And of these was
the story of Godoldok.
There is no dignity so stupendous as a short,
fat man’s ; and the Governor-General —five-feet-
two in height, and little less round the middle—
was, in his own opinion, tremendce rnajestatis ;
which self-estimate—in the days when Sourabaya
was the seat of central government —he had abun-
dant opportunities of translating into action.
“ Fellow!” he said, “do you understand? It
is the Government of His Netherlandic Majesty
which does you the honor to offer to buy your
land! And do you dare to ref use ? ”
“ Excellency ! ” the venerable Chinaman an-
swered from his knees, “ it is indeed, as your Ex-
cellency says, a great honor. But money is of no
consequence to me in comparison with the place
in which I have dwelt so many years, and which
—being now very old—l hope soon to leave to my
children.”
“ Excellency’s ” red face grew purple, and for
half-a-minute he stumped to and fro before the
profundity of his astonishment would let him
even swear.
“ Hear this funny fellow! ” he said ; then,
“ Hear this facetious dog, who pretends to put
his misbegotten yellow spawn in the scale against
the express wish of—of Me—gentlemen— Me !
—and he laughed witli such stertorous ferocity
that his medical attendant ventured to suggest:
“If your Excellency would be calmer, lne
“ Away, ass ! —away ! And you, Chinaman
once more I—you will not take the price we otter
you ? ” „
“No price, Excellency, would - . • '
“Get up, dog !—get up, and come hither.
The old man—shaky, but unshakable—came
over to the table, and the Governor, standing
opposite, took from his pocket a cobanp.
“ Bear witness, gentlemen all! r lhe Government
of the Netherlands—through me, its unworthy
servant—has offered this man 60,000 guilders tor
his land, whereon to build a new residency. He
refuses - and the government —again through me
pays over to him this ” —he slapped the two-cent.
piece upon the table—“ and takes the land !
The Chinaman—thrust out of doors—went away,
unruffled ; he thought the two-cent business was
some weird, unfathomable kind of joke. But,
that night, came a party of soldiers and explained
to him with their musket-butts that there was no
joke at all in the matter, and that he and his had
forthwith to depart from off “Government pro-
perty.”
* * * *
“ What insolent hound is that ?” The Governor
jumped up in his carriage and pointed with his
sheathed sword to a figure that stood up, solitary
and conspicuous, from the line of natives cringing
in the dust till the great man should have passed.
“ Bring the fellow hither ! ”
With bayonets in his rear, the recalcitrant was
marched to the carriage—a Chinaman, old and
feeble, with dull despair in his eye. And the
Governor —knowing him well—spoke as to a
stranger.
“ Who are you, fellow, and whence come you,
not to know who I am, and what your duty is
when I pass by ? ’* . •
And the old man, looking him steadily in the
eye, answered quietly, “Too well I know thee
tyrant ! scoundrel ! Robber of my children !
(3urse of Sourabaya, and accursed, thyself, of
every honest man in it.”
“Ha!” said the Governor. “Ho! hum! Is
that all ? ” and, to the paralysing astonishment of
his staff, he coolly told his coachman to drive on.
* * * •
But that night, upon the open space between
the Presidency and Tagassan village, the moon
looked down at a select but miscellaneous
party. The Governor, two of his officials, a ser-
geant’s guard of soldiers,' a kneeling Chinaman,
a brawny little Javanese standing over him with
a heavy parang.
The Governor raised his hand —the Javani
swung his weapon ; the Governor’s hand went
down—the Chinaman’s head left his shoulders at a
stroke.
“Government’s receipt,” said the great man,
with a chuckle. “ And, .1 say, Krantz—wouldn’t
it be a good idea to bury him here ? ”
The subordinate—dutifully convulsed at the
merry conceit aforesaid —thought it would hardly
do. ‘ ‘ The other yellow animals, Excellency,
would probably dig him up again, to send his
bones to China.”
“ Would they so ? Get spades, and let the
grave be dug! ” and the Governor, lighting a
cigar, strolled to and fro till the work was nearly
finished.
“I have it, Krantz !” he said then. I know
how to keep this carrion down tdl doomsday, and
spite these Javanese curs, as well. What do they
call that big stone image they -think -such a lot ot
—the thing that’s to bring such ill-luck to boura-
baya, if it’s ever moved - • .
“ Godoldok, your Excellency moans, ancl the
secretary lowered his voice as he glanced towards
the Javanese executioner. “ I fea,r,.it would niake
trouble; the people hold it very sacred. And,
besides, the figure is enormously heavy.”
“Sacred? Tuyfel, sir!—don’t the sneaking
dogs call themselves Mahometans? They’ll have
their own priests about their ears if they make
any fuss about a Hindu statue ! And, as ft>r the
weight, sir”—the Governor put his bristles up—
“the thing shall be done, sir, if it takes every
man and every bullock in bourabaya. to do it!
And you, sir-r-as you’re so good at raising objec-
tions—you’ll take charge of the matter. And
you’ll see tha,t the job is done within the week,
too—if you’re wise ! ” '
It was done ! Amidst the smothered curses ot
a people whose Hinduism projects everywhere
through a thin veneer of Islam, Godoldok was
laboriously transported to where, above the China-
man’s bones, be has sat till the Dutchmen them-
selves have forgotten most of the story.
But, for the Javani and the Chinaman, so many
cruel memories cluster round that grim, colossal
figure that, to the Dutch in Java, “Godoldok!
may one day be the watchword of destruction.

The Cripple.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sitting beside the city gate,
Calmar the Cripple cursed his fate.
“ Parsons,” he snarled, “ say ‘ kiss the> rod ’!
What do I owe to the grace of God ?
What has their good God done for me ?
Made me a scorn and a mockery.
Eh, but they talk so fair and fine !
Would they had twisted limbs like mine !
All that I see can ride or run—
I am a dead man under the sun.”
Striding in haste the Cripple by,
Went a patrician, proud of eye j
And to that human heap absurd
Threw forth a coin, with a kindly word.
“Damn him ! Damn him ! Early and late,”
Calmar the Cripple cursed in hate.
“ He was born high ; I was born low—
That is the reason I hate him so.
He has the best to drink and eat;
I am an outcast on the street.
He goes apparelled like a king j
Rags are my richest covering.
Fortune to him has given in dower
Beauty and Birth and Wealth and Power.
Me she has cramped in a crippled frame,
Born to a heritage of shame.
He, with his sunny and gallant air,
Idol of women is everywhere.
Me they regard with pitying scorn,
Wondering why I was ever born;
And, as they pass me by in pride,
Sweep their delicate skirts aside,
Knowing not that their passing feet
Thrill me and fill me with rapture sweet.
Knowing not that their subtle, fine
Perfume maddens my brain like wine.
He he can talk to them, make them smile' j
None of them guess he’s a fool the white 1
Little he knows as he laughs with glee-
How he is understood by me ;
Body and soul of him understood—
Scabbard of velvet, sword of wood.
Ah, if I only had his chance,
How would my life gleam with Romance
Just then a Presence passing by-

Touched him and said : “ AJas, .for thee !

Swiftly the Cripple rose straight'and (tall,
Flinging his crutches against the wall,
Striding away in a gallant style :
Fate at his elbow laughed the while.

CREEVE ROE.
The Window.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Men swore to themselves when they thought of
Mrs. Hay—that is to say, many men did. She
was frequently described as a devil; but the term
is so vague it might have been a compliment.
Mrs. Hay was pretty and audacious; when the
man was willing and fairly presentable, she would
go far, but had a horror of extremes. The women
said she went too far, the men thought not far
enough, and the men knew her best. She led
men on to nowhere, and dropped them there, and
one or two of them never returned.
But Bakewell had won a promise. Perhaps he
was more captivating or more determined than
other men, or perhaps it was her mood. Certainly
he danced wonderfully well. The last waltz was
still in her veins, and the music enveloped her
like a warm atmosphere. Then the night was so
fair, and the garden so full of langour. Given a
man, and a woman, and a garden, and the serpent
is quite superfluous nowadays. At any rate, Mrs.
Hay presently found herself clasped tight in
Fred’s arms, feeling almost helpless, but bargain-
ing excitedly. It was then Bakewell won the
solemn promise, and sealed it.
“I know the window,” he whispered, “ I can
see it from my own house. I have watched it
night after night. Do not fail me, or—or ”
He kissed her.
* * * *
The house was surrounded by a large garden ;
the window had a screen of shrubbery. Bake-
well stole to it in the darkness of the early hours,
and tapped twice upon the pane. Then he raised
the window ever so gently and clambered quietly
into the room. A head was dimly visible on the
white pillow over against the wall. Fred called
her name in a whisper. No answer. He called
again and smiled. “ Shy,” he murmured, and it
pleased him to think so. He crept to the door.
There was no key, so he secured it by jamming a
chair under the look. Then he stole back to the
bed-side. He wore a long overcoat reaching
almost to his ankles.
* * * *
In the passage Bedford was battering at the
door; his daughter, Mrs. Hay, stood near in the
darkness, just as she had sprung from her bed.
From within the room came terrifying shouts of
“fire” and “thieves.” Outside there were
hurried footsteps and the muffled curses of a man
in hasty retreat. At last there was a crash, and
the door gave way. Upon the floor of the bed-
room, rolled into a ball, with all the sheets and
blankets about him, kicked Mrs. Hay’s grand-
father, a very stout, strong, deaf old gentleman ;
and as he wallowed he screamed of fire and
thieves, and burglars, and declared that he was
murdered in his bed by twelve unscrupulous bush-
rangers.
Redford’s match disclosed the lamentable con-
dition of the venerable gentleman, but already
Mrs. Hay bad contrived to secrete the black over-
coat she had discovered on the carpet by the bed-
side.
The window was closed, and Redford could find
no traces of an intruder. Had it not been for the
broken chair he might have convinced his father
that he had really become subject to nightmares
in his old age.
* * • *
Next evening a carrier brought Fred Bakewell
a parcel containing a long overcoat and a short
note. The note was anonymous, and ran :
You fool! my window was bolted.”
B.D.
Man Proposes, but.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is the story of a girl who went fishing and of
what she caught. The fish she wished to land was
a rather nice boy with a good position and
friends; and the girl in her wisdom thought he
would be the better of a wife. But the man was
not in the mood to consider seriously the beauties
of woman ; he had been on the hook before when
it was a pleasure to be thus tortured, and having
been duly played-with and fooled, was tossed
back again somewhat the worse for the operation.
Which gave him a desire to play a woman on his
hook, should the chance come.
_ But the girl knew not of all this; so she de-
livered herself into the hands of the enemy. And
the end of the game came thus : They had gone the
usual way of a man and a maid, that is, by dances
and moonlight walks and little presents and glove
wagers, but so far the man had said nothing
definite, and the girl, thinking to bring matters to
a head, went in for a furious flirtation with another
man. Just then the young man went off for his
annual holiday, and on his return learned certain
things. Then, being a youth of understanding,
he perceived that the time had arrived. So he
called at the house of the girl, and, after friendly
greetings, he talked pleasantly awhile. Then
rising, as if to take his leave, he remarked, “By
the way, Miss Cliffe, I didn’t tell you of the piece
of luck I had since I’ve been away. I drew a
horse in one of Tatt.’s sweep i, and he ran third.
Of course it isn t a fortune, but it means seven or
eight hundred clear.”
“ I’m so pleased to hear it. That was a slice of
luck.”
Yes, and in addition to that, the governor’s
raised my screw. I’m getting ,£3OO a year now.”
Then the girl, thinking the fish was safely
hooked and the line taut, began to haul in on
the line.
“Really, Mr. Waring, how nice ! And I sup-
pose you’re thinking of getting married now ? ”
“Well, I suppose I could marry now. The
sweep-money would nearly buy and furnish a
decent house, and the salary is enough to get
married on. Don’t you think so?”
“ Really, I have never given the matter a
thought.
“ Damme,”thought the man, “she might lie a
little more scientifically.”
“ But then-—there’s the lady ! I know so
many girls, just a little ; but few well enough for
that.”
The girl waited.
Then the man rose and took the girl’s hand in
his, and placed the other on his shoulder.
“ Miss Cliffe—Dorothy—you have heard what I
just said—about my prospects and all that—and
really, I’m not a bad sort of a fellow, you know ;
and I do think I’d make a good sort of' a husband’
and be kind to a girl ” Here he halted for a
moment, and the girl looked up into his face and
put up her mouth to be kissed ; and the man was
just about to do it when he thought of that other
one. His face hardened; he dropped the girl’s
hand, and looked round at the clock.
“By Jove,” he burst out, “nearly eleven. I
ought to be home by this.” Then he grabbed his
hat. “ Good night, Miss Cliffe ; by-the-way, to-
day’s the first of April; you won’t forget, will
you ? Good night.”
The girl did not forget!

H. : “ Speculators amuse themselves as to
the chance of Cardinal Gibbons, or some other Non -
‘ Italian, becoming Pope. But the Pope must be
an Italian, by a custom over 300 years old, adopted
to obviate national jealousies, which are surely
now stronger than ever, wherefore it is merely
tickling the ignorant to write about a foreigner
getting the Pontificate.
“ Constance Clyde ” to The Bulletin :
Maoriland, with its advanced socialistic legislation,
possesses the poorest attempts at radical literature. The
workman is so well represented in Parliament that he
doesn’t need representation on the press. Consequently,
the M.L. journalist of socialistic tendencies will begin to
earn the half of an honest living only on the return to
power of that party which didn’t represent the country
some nine or ten years ago. Meanwhile, he is adding
“May the kingdom of Captain Russell come” to the
general journalistic prayer, “ Give me this day my daily
idea,” without, so far, much sign of success. As for the
M.L. penwoman, fortunately for herself, she hardly existsas
yet. Where she does she usually earns her living by doing
something else. Maoriland would seem to sustain the
theory that in proportion as a country progresses in “ reli-
gion ’’and so-called morality, it retrogrades in literature.
Themost churchy and respectable coun try in Australasia, it
isthernost “lost” from a literary standpoint. In Dunedin,
which is the holy of holies, a poet is the man who goes
round the offices asking you to buy his rhymed version of
Job. You buy it to help on a “ cause,” which is never, by
any possibility, the cause of literature. What literary
encouragement there is takes the form of prize com-
petitions, and that poetry doesn’t rank high here is
shown by the fact that even this dubious form of encour-
agement has never been extended towards the virse-
maker except on the especial occasion of the provincial
jubilee, and then the poet had to forward with his effusion,
a certified statement that he had consumed so much tea
and sugar at a certain store ! Pegasus harnessed to the
grocer’s cart! Theaverage M.L. brain-power is, probably,
greater than in most parts of Australia, but it is early
shunted off on religious or commercial rails.
