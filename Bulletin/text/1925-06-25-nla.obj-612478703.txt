Conceit as a Literary Asset
Humility and modesty may be pleasing
to Providence, but they do not win the favor
of the Muses. This is very noticeable in
regard to literature. While there may be
some writers of great poems or line plays
or immortal novels who are modest, they
are so few that their names do not readily
occur. Most of the best writers of the pre-
sent day are unutterably conceited, and if
we examine the lives and works of those
who have given us the classics, Ave almost
invariably find that a protruding conceit is
common to them all.
It may be asked whether there is proof
of Shakspeare’s conceit. But first we must
remember that Sliakspeare considered himself
an actor rather than a play-writer. Remem-
bering this, there in ample proof. We have
only to think how frequently the profession
of the actor is alloAved to intrude into a story
wherein it has no part. In his greatest play
Sliakspeare requires the actors to interrupt
the whole action merely to praise some one
type of acting and to condemn another. Is
it not reasonable to suppose that the acting
that was being praised Avas the acting of
Sliakspeare, and the acting that was being
con'demned that of his rivals? That is cer-
tainly conceit; and just as Sliakspeare told
his audiences that his acting was superior
to others, so he felt that his plays were
better than others, and frankly proclaimed
that conviction by re-writing the others be-
fore his company Avas alloAved to play them.
An epic theme, sii.cli as Milton’s greatest,
does not seem to offer much opportunity for
the out-cropping of the author’s conceit; yet
Milton managed to leave evidence, even in
“Paradise Lost,” of a vigorous self-glorifica-
tion. The God Almighty of that poem is
John Milton much magnified.
From Steele and Addison right down to
the present day there is no need to search
for evidence of the inevitable. Lamb has
covered many precious pages telling us about
himself. Hazlitt has written a special essay
proving that his own “familiar” style is the
most difficult of all to write. Banyan is
the hero of all his own books, and he com-
placently puts himself into Heaven Avhile the
rest of us are left wailing without. Words*
Avorth almost spoiled himself as a poet in his
eagerness to prove what a wonderful poet
he was. Pepys’s sole hold upon fame lies
in his complete pre-occupation with self.
Shelley alloAved Keats to die unrecognised
because the poetry of Keats Avas not like the
poetry of Shelley; Keats sent a letter to
Shelley urging him to Avrite, not like Shelley,
but like Keats: and Byron canonised most
of his OAvn indiscretions in immortal verse.
These men Avere Avidelv different in most
respects, but all Avere greatly impressed by
their own importance, and eager to tell the
Avorld about it.
'Whether or not these Avriters of past cen-
turies were conscious of the. part conceit
played in the forming of their literary repu-
tations cannot be said, but we know that
most of our recent and living celebrities have
been keenly conscious of it. In one of his
“ssays Oscar Wilde has said that no matter
how dull or tedious a person is, Avhen he
talks about himself he is always charming.
With Wilde conceit was not only a character-
istic; it Avas a policy. “I have nothing to
declare but my genius,” lie told the Custom
officials when entering America.
The less cultured but more boisterous con-
ceit of ShaAv supplies much of the enjoyment
of his plays. The minute description that
is given of Tanner in “Man and’Superman”
is supplied so . that there may be no doubt
»t all that the chief character of the play
is ShaAv himself. Iff “The Doctor’s Dilem-
ma,” again, the chief character is made to
proclaim himself a disciple of Bernard Shaw,
and each lengthy preface tells at full length
Avhat Bernard Shaw thinks, has done and
may do. Two of Upton Sinclair’s latest
books are chiefly about himself; Jack Lon-
don has left two and a half admirable auto-
biographies ; and Frank Harris is now writ-
ing his memoirs, which will certainly re-
semble the memoirs of Casanova in their
glorification of the Avriter. In the best writ-
ing of to-day conceit holds a larger place
than ever before.
Docs this indicate that great literary pow-
ers give rise to conceit, or does it mean that
conceit produces genius? There are excel-
lent reasons for supposing that conceit plays
a very big part in the development of literary
power. _ Conceit resolves itsedf into pre-
occupation with self, and the making of one’s
self the standard by which all else is judged.
Literary art is the self-expression of the
writer. In describing a scene, to give a mere
invoice of details is to be dull; to convey
to the reader Avhat the writer feels and thinks
when viewing it is art. What gives vigor,
life and interest to a story or poem or play
is that very infusion into it of the writer’s
self. It is_ the writer’s overpowering in-
terest in himself which explains his self-
expression. If he is a man of Antal thought,
a man capable of real passion ; if his blood
runs freely and his mind knows the richness
of color: if lie feels that fine disdain of the
commonplace. the. mediocre and the accepted
that will enable him to set up his own valua-
tions and to judge bA r his own precepts • and
if,_ added to that, there be a sublime con-
sciousness of the superiority of self over the
mass, then will he be a Avriter to whom tfm
Avorld of intellect will listen eagerly, and for
••bom posterity will reserve a crown of fame.
Australian Avriters would learn the lesson
"t conce’t. their public would become more
alert and more eager for their work. Most
of them are far too modest at present.
LESTER WAT
The Story of Our Submarines
On a point off Port Darwin was clustered
a group of abos. gazing out to sea. “Big
fellah him come first, little fellah him come
after—all same emu,” said one. What they
saw was the Sydney bringing home AEI and
AE2, Australia's first submarines. What
those on board the incoming vessels discerned
was “a bold point covered with green and
luxuriant tropical growth, from the midst of
which the tops of houses peeped out to give
an impression of most extreme cosiness.”
From the Port across to Thursday Island
then south inside the shelter of the Barriei
Reef, and on Sunday, May 24, 1914, as dawn
was breaking, the big ship led its two little
emus through Sydney Heads and up
to Garden Island. “I wonder,” said the
captain of AE2, “if there is any man 01
earth more patriotic and proud of his coun
try than the Australian? I doubt it.” Anc
he enjoyed to the full, after that long ant
risky journey from the homeland, the hospi-
tality of the country to whose folk liis heari
warmed—“a charming and delightful people.’
Two months were spent in “every cheery
pastime which tin? philanderer can wish to
taste”; then one day an officer walked into
the mess as the captain and his staff were
sitting down to lunch and announced
“Gentlemen, war was declared on Germany
at midnight, English time.” “There was a
pause—a silence fell on all present. Then,
‘Waiter, gin and bitters, please,’ said the
engineer-lieutenant. From our point of view
it seemed to be finite as sensible and usefu'
a remark as any other comment could be.”
From this point onward the writer. Com-
mander H. G. Stoker, tells in Straws in the
Wind (Herbert Jenkins) the dramatic his-
tory of our two submarines. The cffcw ot
AE2 under his command was composed of
half Australian and half R.N. ratings, as
was also the crew of the ill-fated AEI. In
mid-August the Australian Fleet, under
Admiral Patcy, sailed from Sydney with
orders to take Rabaul. Between New
Britain and New Ireland lies the narrow
St. George’s Strait, through which all ships
making Rabaul from the southward must
pass. To guard this strait was the duty of
the two “emus.” AE2 went on guard the
first day, then returned to harbor and AEI
sailed out the following day. She left at
daybreak, a haze resting on the water, and
giving a visibility of from two to five miles
only. In this grey mist that held for hours,
the accompanying destroyer lost sight of
AEI; and the veil that then shut her
out no human eye has penetrated. They
waited her return, at first hopefully, then
anxiously, and finally in despair. She was
due to be back at sunset. The sun set, and
the little vessel with her crew failed to re-
port. Where she lies, no man knows. Pro-
bably she had dived, and while doing so
had gone out of control. “The sinking sub-
marine would slip aAvay down into the vast
depths existing in those parts, rapidly filling
as the increased pressure of water outside
forced its way through the hull, bringing
a quick and clean death to the crew, whose
end might well have come even before their
steel tomb had reached the ocean’s bed.” So
Australia’s first completed submarine was
our first warship to be lost. In her died
“three skilful officers, best of good fellows
and British gentlemen, and 32 specially-
selected and -trained seamen and stokers.”
When fear of Von Spee’s return to the
Western Pacific had subsided, the remain-
ing little “emu” returned to Sydney. " There
she lay for a while, her crew chafing whilst
the Great War raged in Europe. At length
her commander'seeured permission to take her
abroad, and once more she sailed the high seas
on the long journey to the seat of Avar. AE2
set out on the last day of 1914 towed by
a transport. Colombo reached, a journey
of 3400 miles, she went on to Suez. Troops
lined the banks of the canal and cheered as
the Australian boat passed on her way to
the scene of her last dramatic exploit. “Aus-
tralians and New Zealanders rivalled each
other in ‘coo-ees’ and Aveird cries” and so
on till Port Said Avas reached. Thence shs
went to join the fieot off the Dardanelles.
The Dardanelles Strait is 35 miles long
and half a mile wide at the NarroAvs of
Chanak. From the Mediterranean to the
Sea of Marmora. Avhich the Strait connects,
the Avay was _ sown thick Avith perils. To
dive through in the hope of evading mines
and dodging the fire of the covering forts
seemed hardly a sane venture. Still, there
were men. English and Australian, ready
to take this risk against its tremendous odds.
The little emu Avas first in the field. “The
military value of the feat Avould obviously
be enormous. Once through, on the high
road of traffic to the Gallipoli Peninsula, all
movements off ships must be seriously ham-
pered. and perhaps even stopped, and oppor-
tunities must occur of attacking the Turkish
fleet and transports.” Stoker at last suc-
ceeded in obtaining the permission he sought.
Aboard the Queen Elizabeth he put his pro-
position to attempt the great dive with his
Australian sub. Commodore Keyes, the Chief
of Staff as he then was, found it difficult to
believe the feat possible; but he saw that its
military \ r alue Avould be great if successful.
If Stoker got his boat through, then other
boats Avould follow immediately. “If y.ou
succeed.” he said, “there is no calculating the
result, and it may well be that you will have
done more to finish the war than any other
act accomplished.” All Avas soon ready,
The first attempt, however, was doomed to
failure, the shaft which Avorked the fore-
most diving rudders breaking. There was
nothing for it but to return. ToAvards even-
ing of the following day the Queen Eliza-
beth arrived, and the Admiral sent for the
dejected skipper. • “But kindness again was all
I met. ‘lt was very bad luck. You did well
to get so far. Try again to-morrow’ ”:—
Three a.m. on Sunday, April 25. It was abso-
lutely dark- still and dead calm as AE2 entered
the Dardanelles Strait arid followed the same plan
as on the previous night. With Kephez searchlight
touching us more brightly from time to time, one
knew that no hope could be entertained of reaching
as high a point as on the previous night.... Bang!
... .Within a minute we were submerged. . . .At dead-
slow speed, and at 20 feet, we dived along on our
course.... and then lowering the periscope we
plunged to 70 feet for the passage through the
main minefield.... Rappings and scrapings on the
hull of the boat by the mooring wires of the mines.
.... on two occasions something hard—much harder
than the wires—hit the bo\vs and rattled away astern ;
Avere they mines which failed to explode ?... . Twice
Ave rose for hasty observations and then away to
the safer depths.
These extracts give some idea of the graphic
style in wliicli tlie author tells bis enthralling
story of tlie passage through the Straits into

How The Chrysler Six Gets Its
Power, Pull, Speed and Snap
You are running along at, say, 25 in your
Chrysler. Put on your 4-wheel brakes. Pull
it down to five miles an hour, to three. There
isn’t a tremor.
Now, put your foot on the accelerator.
Softly, but clearly, surely, powerfully, the
power strokes pick up.
In high speed, your Chrysler Six pulls away
—gaining steadily, smoothly, without
vibration.
Then push the accelerator all the way down.
Never mind if you are travelling only two
or three miles an hour; give her the ’gas.”
There’s a rush of power. You gain speed
like the wind.
In no time your speedometer says 40; then
50; then 60—65—68—70—and more.
Think of it; over 70 miles an hour from a
motor of 3-inch bore and 4f-inch stroke.
That s the result of balance, elimination of
friction, utilisation of fuel, perfect carbu-
retion and correctly applied thermo-
dynamics—the result, in a word, of scien-
tific engineering.
Possibly you don’t know anything about
thermo-dynamics. Most people don’t.
Thermo-dynamics is the science of heat
distribution in relation to power generation.
It means, in the Chrysler Six, scientifically-
designed intake gas passages. In them the
“gas” is correctly heated and distributed.
Every cylinder gets just the same volume of
explosive mixture—and does just the same
amount of work.
Anything less than this perfect distribution
of the mixture would mean uneven opera-
tion of the engine.
In the Chrysler Six, every cylinder takes
exactly one-sixth of the gas; every piston
carries one-sixth of the working load.
That means steady pull and reduced vibra-
tion and frictional resistance.
It’s like hauling hand-over-hand on a rope;
that’s steady pull.
But let your left hand rest —or merely
hold on—while the right does all the actual
pulling. That produces a jerky motion.
The Chrysler Six also has a special com-
bustion chamber.
This combustion chamber burns all the gas.
A motor runs, you know, because vaporised
petrol or hydro-carbon mixed with oxygen
is exploded by a spark so that the force of
the explosion pushes down a piston.
If you don’t burn all that mixture, the
cylinders, the spark plugs, the pistons get
gummed with carbon compound—and the
wheels don t get all the power out of the gas.
Special combustion chambers insure no left-
over unburned gas in the Chrysler Six.
Then, too, the valves are symmetrical and
spaced equally distant from the centre of
each cylinder, with valve seats completely
surrounded by cooling water.
The gas comes into all cylinders at the same
velocity, and the burned gas is ejected at the
same rate that the new gas is taken in.
That perfect balance means flashing pick-
up and marvellous speed.
So here s what really scientific engineering
means to you in the Chrysler Six:
lop-speed well over 70 miles an hour.
Petrol economy safely over 18 miles per
gallon.
Lugging power "on high” that will pull you
through the deepest sand or mud, or take
you up any hill a car can cling to.
In every detail of its design and materials,
the Chrysler Six is just as fine as its per-
formance. It is pre-eminently a quality light
car. It could not be better built if it sold
for twice its list price.
Don t fail to see and to ride in the Chrysler
Six.

the Sea of Marmora. AE2 was followed, on
the receipt of a wireless message or the sue-
cessful penetration, by El 4, and through a
misadventure, of which the latter was in-
directly the cause, the Australian sub. came
to its end :
Bang!.... a cloud of smoke in the engine-room.
We were hit and holed! And again in quick suc-
cession two more holes. Finished! We were caught.
We could no longer dive and our defence was gone.
.... All hands were ordered on deck and overboard.
While the crew scrambled up on deck an omcer
remained with me below to take the necessary steps
for sinking.... A shout and we clambered up; but
there was still a minute to spare. I jumped down
and had a last look round —for, you see, I was
fond of AE2.
This ends the story of AE2, the little
emu that 14 months before had been com-
missioned as a unit of the Australian Fleet.
During that time she had traversed 35,006
miles, was the first submarine to travel half
round the world and the first to pass the
Dardanelles.

Gentle Gas
My own lirst interest in chemicals in-
tended for introduction to warfare in order
to help God in giving the victory to the
Right was awakened in my infancy by a
family acquaintance with a dear, pious-
minded old inventor, who lived in the then
wide-scattered Waverley-Coogee district of
Sydney. He was a man of much science,
who must have had some achievement to
his credit, for he had wealth to spare; but
though he built a house full of all kinds of
labor-saving conveniences, he forgot to provide
stairs to the upper rooms, and they had to. be
reached from outside. The only other of his
ventures which made an impression upon me
was his poison-gas, particularly recalled by
the fact that he used the pepper-pot one
day at dinner to show how his chemical
might be dropped upon a city—constructed,
I remember, of crockery and table appurten-
ances—to wipe out the inhabitants if they
were opposed to the will of God and Britain.
He went to church regularly whenever there
was a church open to go to, and he talked
about his world-conquering poisons to the
people who did not get away quickly enough
when the service was over.
Perhaps my outlook upon world-conquering
chemicals has been prejudiced by my early
recollections of this scientist; but even when
I went to the war and acquired a keen per-
sonal hatred of chemical warfare, the most
vaunted methods of wiping out armies chemi-
cally always reminded me of the house with-
out the stairs.
A hundred prophecies of inventions which
would “make war impossible” were issued
long before the war; and there was Conan
Doyle’s novel “The Poison Belt” —published
only a year before the Kaiser put the match,
to the gunpowder—in which the whole popu-
lation of the world, with the exception of
a few far-sighted people who were saved by
oxygen stored by a scientist, was wiped out.
War science was also drifting towards poison
gases long before the Big Trouble started;
and before gases were used elsewhere Major
P. H. Morton, who got to Gallipoli with the
Light Horsemen turned infantry, made a
suggestion for sending down heavy poison
gases on the Turkish trenches while they
were lower than our own. The plan was
considered by G.H.Q., but vetoed on the
ground that, it was against the rules of war
and the spirit of humanity. That decision
was on all fours with the refusal of the
British authorities to follow the German
lead and lengthen the rods of rifle grenades
so that they would go further. With the
prejudices of the time gone, it must be
admitted that the German attitude was the
sanest in an insane business —in effect, that
a nation’s first care should be for its own
soldiers, improving their chances of killing
their enemies without being killed themselves.
In any case, the first real gas-shells intro-
duced in the war were used by the French,
who had the glorious feeling that they had
something which would literally petrify the
enemy amongst whom it fell; but the casual-
ties amongst their own men caused the new
war-instrument to be dropped, ’just as later
German casualties from the use of cloud-
gas caused that method to become unpopular.
Later on, when the drenches became awful
and effective, gas was still more a haunting
terror than an active destroyer, the use of
the gas-masks for security being dreaded
more than the gas itself, and the constant
fear had a tremendous psychological effect.
In The Medical Aspects of Chemical War-
fare, Colonel E. B. Vedder, of the U.S.A.
Army Medical Service, tries to lead public
opinion to a new view of chemical agents in
war. He claims that, in spite of popular
prejudice, the chemist’s laboratory has pro-
duced the most humane weapon usable in
the inhumane business. He insists that in
any case chemicals will certainly be increas-
ingly used in war, for the samp reason that
the combatants who knew the uses of gun-
powder refused to wage war with arrows
and spears. Nor does he shudder at the
prospect as much as one might expect. Actu-
ally in proportion to numbers there was more
slaughter in the wars when hand-to-hand en-
counters were necessary; the experience is
that the deadlier the weapons used the fewer
the fighters who are killed.
Vedder considers, then, that, beyond the
determination to use the most effective
weapons, a realisation that chemical warfare
is the most humane will be a factor. He
bases his claims for the “humaneness” of gas
on his experience in France, and from re-
cords of casualties. Chlorine gas yielded
some terrible after-effects, but was super-
seded by chemicals which were more effective
and less cruel. Taking American data,
Vedder finds that of each hundred men
gassed only 1.73 died; for each hundred
wounded by missiles, the death-rate was
5.26 per cent.; “other military agents” pro-
duced a death-rate of 4.72 per cent. Of
the admissions to hospital 65.9 per cent,
were due to gunshots and 31.49 per cent,
to gas; but 89.05 per cent, of the deaths
were due to the former, and a mere 8.92
per cent, to the latter. Following these lines
he hints at the possibility of a “humane”
future warfare, in which highly effective
gases may produce myriads of casualties
who will be well out of the argument, nut
with slight mortality.
There will be considerable agreement with
the author’s opinion that the after-effects
of gassing have been exaggerated. Gas was
the line of least resistance with the lead-
swinger; multitudes of malingerers in the
A.I.F. who saw the “quack” pleaded “gas.”
But the lead-swinging has been multiplied
since the war. With the almost complete
absence of known tests, it is easy for the
man seeking special kindness from Repat. to
throw in “a touch of gas” with his other
sufferings. In America 300,000 ex-soldiers
made claim for pensions on account of the
effects of gas; the total possible gas casual-
ties was only 70,552! As Colonel Vedder
points out, a neurasthenic condition may
lead a soldier to consider he is still suffer-
ing from gas effects long after they have
gone. With wounds his progress can be
checked ; with gas there is no check in the
majority of cases.
The book is interesting; but whilst it may
be conceded that a very small percentage
have suffered any permanent injury from the
gas used in the war, the statement that
“there is not the slightest evidence that gas-
sing has increased the liability to tubercu-
losis” seems too sweeping.
H. M.
John Barlow
Australia is no exception to a well-nigh
universal rule. The most useful, the most
devoted, the most patriotic of her sons
and daughters are allowed to pass with
hardly the record of a sigh. In John
Barlow Australia owned a rare citizen and a
gifted artist. In his death she suffered a loss
which only the passage of time will make
fully known to her. Quiet, unassuming,
filled with a sense of the beautiful, and
keenly alive to the clamant need of Beauty
in the service of daily common life, Australia
had in him an architectural genius whom she
was all too slow adequately to appreciate;
and she is not yet aware of the calibre of the
man whom she so lightly forgets.
He was an Australian by birth as well as
in sentiment, and his devotion to his native
country never wavered. The eldest son of
his father, a John Barlow also, he was born
65 years ago in Sydney. On leaving the
Lyndhurst Benedictine College he was
articled to Benjamin Backhouse, and he sup-
plemented his studies by a visit to England,
whence lie journeyed to the leading cities of
Europe, spending a year of travel among the
architectural masterpieces of the Old World.
Whilst thus touring the principal art-centres
he was careful to note the modern efforts in
town beautification, and the knowledge thus
gained was a splendid asset to the community
when he was appointed to the City of Syd-
ney Improvement Commission. In this con-
nection he was actively engaged as a prac-
tical adviser in the work entailed in the re-
sumption and remodelling of that portion of
the city known as the Rocks.
A Fellow of the Royal Institute of British
Architects, he was also President for four
years of the local institute; and he was the
first editor of Art and Architecture, a
position which he filled for five years. He
not only wrote many articles for the official
organ of his profession, but he was a con-
stant contributor to other Australian and
American magazines, on general as well as
on professional subjects. An enthusiastic
lover of poetry, he wrote much delightful
and scholarly verse, and one of his first
efforts gained the second prize for an ode for
the inauguration of the Melbourne Exhibi-
tion, the winner of the first being John Ber-
nard O’Hara. In conjunction with W. L.
Vernon and John Sulman he increased the
sphere of his usefulness by the delivery of
lectures to the students at the Institute of
Architects in liis native Sydney. He was
also selected to conduct the oral ex-
aminations of the local candidates for
admission to the Institute of British
Architects. In connection with the Com-
monwealth inaugural celebrations he acted
as one of the advisers to the Government for
the decoration of Sydney, and personally
planned and supervised much of it. He was
the creator of the design for the Handing and
Reception Pavilion in Farm Cove —it should
have been perpetuated in marble as a mem-
orial of the linking together of the States
He specialised in ecclesiastical architecture,
and was a cultured exponent of the Roman
esque style, but his knowledge of art trans
cended the bounds of any special school.
Early in his professional career he de-
signed the original plans and elevation of the
Lewisham Hospital; and among some of the
buildings which stand to his credit are the
Church of St. Canice in Rosslyn Gardens;
the Gothic Church at Rose Bay; St. Mar-
tin’s at Stratlifield; St. Francis’s at Padding-
ton ; the Chapel of the Sacred Heart Hos-
pice at Darlinghurst; and the Father Alphon-
sus Memorial Church of St. Brigid’s at
Mari'iekville —the last-mentioned the largest
parish church in Australasia. The Gothic
Church at Rose Bay is a fine example of
that type of architecture; and the Church
of St. Canice, in the Early English style,
is greatly admired, the treatment being some-
what of a departure from the general char-
acteristics of Catholic churches in Sydney
and suburbs. To his favorite Romanesque,
however, belong the handsome Church of
St. Francis, with its beautiful rose-window,
and its designs in mosaic; the Chapel of the
Sacred Heart Hospice; and the Father
Alphonsus Church at Marrickville. The
last-named is the most ambitious example
of John Barlow’s creative genius. It is a
triumphant specimen of the Romanesque
type, the plan of the building being based
on that of a Roman basilica, with a wide
and lengthy nave, transepts and processional
aisles. The walls are decorated with a
series of beautiful designs in mosaic of inci-
dents of the Passion. This church contains
also a number of noble groups of sacred
statuary, placed in position with a view to
the general ensemble of the interior decora-
tion ; and the baldaehino, now in course of
erection, is said to be the only one in Aus-
tralia. Seen from the outside this shrine of
St. Brigid’s is a beautifully imposing struc-
ture. and its proportions are msthetically
satisfying. But though the exterior appeals
to the eye of taste, the interior is even more
strikingly handsome and inspiring to the
aesthetic sense. It is claimed that with
the exception of St. Mary’s, St. Brigid's is
the only shrine of the Passion in Christen-
dom ; and recognising this fact, the Pas-
sionist Fathers have spared neither expense
nor labor in the making of it a tabernacle
worthy of that great distinction. When
completed, practically all the wall-space, the
pillars, the archways and other portions ex-
posed to the vision will be covered with ex-
quisite carvings and other ornaments depict-
ing sacred subjects and symbols of faith.
When finished to the last touch and tittle of
the architect’s conception, it will be for the
people of Sydney, and for the people of the
(Australian Commonwealth, not only a mem-
orial commemorative of the zeal and devotion
of Father Alphonsus, but a memorial also
commemorative of its erudite and accom-
plished designer.
FRED. J. BLOOMFIELD.
Boosting
Aii excellent book on advertising and sell-
ing, made up of 150 addresses delivered to the
Convention of Associated Advertising Clubs
held in Atlantic City (U.S.A.) last year, is
edited by Noble T. Praigg, and published by
Isaac Pitman and Sons. The most signi-
ficant section tells how advertising can be
used to boost the interests of the Christian
Church. Institutional as distinguished from
doctrinal Christianity has always known the
uses of advertisement, but surely never be-
fore has the subject been treated with such
naive and ingenuous enthusiasm.
The American business man projects his
own personality into his conception of the
Deity. The God worshipped by Mahomed,
David, Luther, Philip the Second of Spain,
Paul Kruger, the last German Emperor, Wil-
liam Gladstone and Charles Spurgeon must
appear in many aspects. I feel sure that
the American God is a Big Business Execu-
tive, with a highly developed office organisa-
tion, and “Do It Now’’ plastered all over
the Courts of Heaven. Thus there is a
chapter on “Religious Thought Guides Big
Business”: —
In every business meriting the prefix “big’’ there
will be found cne or more guiding personalities
who have a distinctly God-fearing character. In-
deed, how could it be otherwise, seeing that an
all-wise Providence created the world, and is help-
ing to apply the principles and the instruments of
human progress? .
There is an outstanding question in my mind
in this connection. Why is it that advertising men
do not appeal to the religious side of the human
animal? They appeal to his pride, his prejudice,
his parsimony, and all other things that pertain
to his emotions and his soul. Why don’t they
appeal to his religion? Nor is this an idle question.
I applied it in our own business, and, as a result,
I got my goods to market without a single agency
or a single salesman. I simply wrote publication
advertisements, got down where people live, and
consequently where people read. They got to know
me. I got the business.
There is a full-page reproduction show-
ing how to draft religious advertisements. I
have known sincerely religious people of the
old-fashioned kind who would describe them
as blasphemous. Here is advice from Wm.
N. Bayless:—
Don’t be the shrinking violet type of church.
Don’t let it sink into back-seat obscurity, forgotten
when any vital matter comes up. Your churcli
should advertise to make the unchurched element
think. Everyone likes to belong to a keen, alert,
up-and-doing organisation that is always cn its
toes. Church advertising has the same effect as is
found in business. The firm that advertises not only
increases its sales, but markedly increases the
esprit de corps of its own personnel.
Or listen to Carl Hunt: —
My excellent friend Merle Sidner had 1025 young
men in his Sunday-school class last Easter morning.
Why? Because he had analysed the needs and
desires of young men in relation to the service that
class can render, just as he would, as an advertising
agent, analyse the business of an automobile manu-
facturer. He has made the class of value to them
in their business, in their social activities. Then,
having found how to render a service of genuine
value, he has advertised that class in terms of whar.
it will do for young men.
Again :
It will be possible for us, as leaders in the
church, to sell our religion to others cn'.y if we buy
it for ourselves, and thus make the world realise
that we mean business. You cannot sell an article
to anyone until you have first sold it to yourself.
How much should a church spend yearly for pub-
licity? I believe that a church with an annual
congregational budget of, say, $lO,OOO, ought
to spend nat less than 10 per cent, for publicity.
I am personally acquainted with several such
churches who find that it pays. Then, finally, one of
the best ways to convince the local church as to
the profit of church publicity is by placing big-
business men at the head of its public ity department.
The Rev. James Allen Blair:—
All of us together must sell the church to the
whole community.
And the Rev. E. E. Elliott:—
Never let a week pass without doing some pub-
licity in connection with your church. If there is
nothing to advertise, go up and start a row ii
necessary, and you will soon get publicity of some
sort.
Mr. Joseph .A. Richards gives an illus-
tration that would have called down a pro-
secution for blasphemy a few years ago. He
likens the third person of the Holy Trinity
to the boss salesman :
It may be the fact that the first assistant sales
manager, the pastor, is out of harmony with the
Sales Manager, the Holy Spirit, and therefore all
the undersalesmen, the church members, are de-
moralised, and don’t know what they are selling.
A church in this condition needs to yield itself
to the General Sales Manager, the Holy Spirit, for
such an overhauling as will give it a new line of
goods, newly packed and presented by a renewed
group of salesmen.
Mr. Richards does not tell us what position
in the business organisation is occupied by
the humble Nazarene. The personality of
Jesus doesn’t somehow seem to fit into a
publicity campaign. Every man is at liberty
to make a God in his own image, but we
have some definite descriptions of the Word
that was made flesh.

and instead of working only for a small circle of

annual publications, works of art in themselves, have
assisted very sensibly.


The Real Facts on
Interchangeable Balloons
Goodyear Interchangeable Balloon
Ty res are made to fit present wheels.
In this only do they differ from the
small diameter type, for they are
essentially of balloon tyre construction.
It is the larger cross section of the
balloon tyre and the thinner sidewall
of high-grade materials that make
lower pressures and greater cushioning
possible.
From the standpoint of cushioning
effect it makes no difference whether
the balloon tyre is made to fit a large
or small diameter wheel.
Goodyear Interchangeables have just
as much “balloon” or cushioning as
small diameters.
And Goodyear Interchangeable
Balloons fit the majority of cars in use
to-day, with no change, if fitted with
straight side, or 30 x 3i Beaded Edge
Rims.
Most cars provide sufficient clearance
to permit equipping with Goodyear
Interchangeables with no interference
whatsoever.
Equip with Goodyear Interchange-
ables and enjoy all balloon tyre
comforts. See the Goodyear Dealer
in your district for further details.

The Burroughs Duplex Adding Machine
is really two adding machines in one-two
machines operated from a single keyboard.
For instance, the Duplex will add groups
of figures and give a total (besides a sub-total)
of each group. Then, without re-listing a
single group total, it gives a grand total of all
groups automatically. Such totals are neces-
sary when dissecting expenses, or sales by
departments, assistants, or lines.
Or, the Burroughs Duplex will add two
columns of figures at the same time and give
separate totals for both columns which it will
combine into a grand total if desired. In listing
cost and selling price, Dr. and Cr. Postings, etc.,
you will find this feature alone will save a
great many minutes.

Duplex, just mail the coupon. You will not

Arden.
An old stone house and a flowerless garden,
A grove of trees where the zephyrs played ;
These are the things that the soul of Arden
Into a place of magic made.
A place for seeing the things unseen and
Enslaving d,rearns that are far and free,
Regretting things that have never been and
Foreknowing things that will never be.
The lamplight played in the rustling arbor,
The darkness deepened about the door,
The night lay soft on the silent harbor,
And lights were bright on the farther shore,
I heard soft music across the garden,
I watched the stars and awhile I dreamed ;
Then I went out from the place called Arden
And watched the waters that darkly
gleamed.
The small, slow steamers, with white wakes
after,
Went drifting down to the deeper sea,
Even as youth and its love and laughter,
Go drifting, drifting away from me.

A Memory.
The flautist played; and music, sweet and
low,
With soft caresses old-time memories woke,
And long-past scenes from bonds of Lethe
broke.
And I beheld red poppies all aglow
Like fiery mantle drape the earth below;
I heard a heaven-rending sound that broke
The still of dawn, while sable clouds of
smoke
Plunged dark and recking round a scene of
woe.
Men cower trembling in a shattered trench.
Unnerved with noise and blood and foul
smoke-gust,
While shrieking shreds of steel through soft
flesh tear.
Brains frenzied reel; stark hands in death-
throes clench,
The whole creation's blasted into dust.
Hell’s fury falls on shuddering Pozieries.
FEDERAL TERRITORY.
P. E. SMYTHE.
Achievement.
Beyond the prison wall a slender tree
Stands in the sunlight of God’s liberty;
A miracle, with pale, refulgent bole
And tapering leaves, whose fragrance seems
their soul.
Across the wall the fragrance makes its wa.v,
A disembodied thing that cannot stay
Long bound to earth ; but it has touched with
grace
The sordid greyness of a prison place.
Round the horizon’s rim dark clouds are
massed
To see the lord of light and life go past,
With splendid robes of leaping flame out-
spread,
And all the gems of day about his head.
Close to the west he moves, and then the
clouds
Cast off the darkness of their winter shrouds :
The limpid rays of Heaven to earth inclines
And lo ! the dusty street becomes a shrine.

Music.
I watched the slow T dawn drifting into day ,
I heard the songs of birds, busy about
Their tiny all-important foraging,
Yet felt within no answering glad shout,
Yet heard no music in the merry lay.
But with the rose-flushed evenfall you came.
One startled songster stirred belatedly.
My heart rebounded in its dear delight,
And then it seemed I heard the melody
Of many birds. You softly spoke my name.

Lovely Night.
When Day with farewell kiss has softly
flown,
Night enters unaware, so silently,
Her dim, thick hair unbound and falling:
free;
And zephyrs light as thistledown have blown
The veil of mystery about her eyes.
Those starry clusters trembling in the blue'
Ethereal vault, supernally to shine,
Breathe of a beatific peace divine,
Of the sublime, the beautiful, and true,
Like golden lilies set in Paradise.
And Luna in her rare white shawl em-
pearled,
With footprints moulded in a silver trace,
Walks in her own inimitable grace,
Whose beauty holds the breath of all the
world,
And spangled dewdrops shimmer on the
flowers.
No moonlit Persian garden were more fair,
Where fountains murmur to love’s endless
theme;
Rich attar, bedded in a rose’s dream
Lends its exotic fragrance to the air,
In all the splendor of the crystal hours.
O lovely night! These things with us are
kin,
All microcosms of a wondrous Whole.
The* radiant stars make luminous the soul;
No marvel that the memory within
Clings to a pre-existence undefined.
They gleam as purely and translucently
As when from Chaos called by the Most
High
From coldest azure air to gild the sky,
For all the mons of eternity,
The silent witnesses of mortal kind.

THE POGRAMS AND FLADDOCKS OF
AUSTRALIA.
When Charles Dickens depicted the
Pograms and Fladdocks of the United States
in Queen Victoria’s early days, he painted
a grotesque but not specially harmful crew.
They declared, in and out of season, that
the wonderful development of their country
staggered the nations, that the achievements
of their people staggered the globe, and that
the efficiency of their institutions staggered
the universe. But they weren’t expected to
seriously influence events wTtu all this stagger-
ing. Some of them were politicians, but the
community didn’t depend, in the sense that
Australia does, on politicians for its rail
ways and roads and harbors, and almost
everything else that means progress. It was
not the duty of the Pograms and their kind
to tell their country that it was really a
backward place, and thereby earn the loath
ing of superficial folk, who would charge
them with maligning the nation. They
could grease the noisy patriot by declaring
that everything had been done, and noth-
ing, as a natural inference, required doing,
while a different class of men did things
which very much required doing, and wasted
no time on eloquence, and greased no patriot,
Private Enterprise is sordid, but it has done
a great deal with private money in the way
of developing the wilderness. It has only
to consider whether the wilderness will be
likely to pay in cash, whereas Public Enter-
prise has got to tlie point at which it daren’t
do anything with public money for the
wilderness until that lone spot can pay in
votes, which it never can till after the money
is spent. Nothing larger than a crab or
more rapid than a snail can be done for
undeveloped and neglected Australia without
rousing the interest of a city and suburban
majority which grows larger and more self-
centred every year. And to effect much that
matters truths have to he told which almost
amount to insults, and arouse dander as
well as interest. If a sleek and comfortable
prophet such as Prime Minister Bruce
could be detailed wholly for the work of
tickling the national vanity about the vast
achievements of the allegedly brilliant and
fertile past, while a man such as John
Monasii was working long hours at build-
ing big tilings in the sterile present, it would
be a pleasing division of toil. Elijah
Pogram has his uses, but waiting for him
to create a South-to-North railway is a heart-
breaking business.
* * * *
Australia’s Sleek Prophet found a con-
genial field of usefulness recently when lie
addressed the Central Methodist Mission in
Sydney. A Methodist mission may not ap-
pear a very inspiring audience, but a truly
warm-hearted orator can unload his men-
tality to a kindergarten. Some of his say-
ings were thus reported by a friendly nress:
(1) .No country in the world offers greater possi-
bilities for social and economic development in the
immediate future than Australia. When the
Harbor Bridge is completed, Sydney will soon be-
come the second city of the Empire. Sydney will
then be comparable witli any other city of the
Empire, and indeed of the world.
(2) Pessimists grumbled about how little had
been done, but there was greater development in
Australia within the last hundred years than had
ever taken place in any other country of the world
within that period of time, not excluding the
United States. Australia, with its population of
six millions, had developed its railways and roads at
an incomparable rate, with the result that the roads
now led to every part of the Commonwealth, and
the mileage of the Australian railways was equal to
that of Great Britain.
(3) It was known that in every State of the Com-
monwealth there were enormous stores of minerals
and large quantities of coal.
(4) They should get rid of the suspicion that now
existed between the different classes. The greatest
danger to Australia in the future was the canker of
class-consciousness and suspicion. There was no
reason for this, as the people of Australia on the
whole were better off than the people of any other
country, and their standard of living was higher
than that of any other country.
(5) There is no doubt that we are a great
people....
After that deliverance it would almost
be bathos and surplusage for S. M.
Bruce to do anything of importance for
the Commonwealth, this Parliament or next.
It is rather a duty to mark time till the
lagging world catches up. The one fly in
the ointment of oratory was furnished by
Major-General Ryrie, who said there would
never be peace in Australia till the brutal,
insolent and law-defying gang of imported
conspirators who run the industrial show,
and seem like running the whole show, wer?
sent hack whence they came —or words to
that effect. The Sleek Prophet wouldn’t
dream of saying or doing anything so rude.
* * * *
The only man with a patriotic ambition
to get things done who can begin without
instructing the people as to wliat remains
undone, is the benevolent despot; he can do
things and let the people appreciate them
afterwards. Under our other sort of gov-
ernment there is plenty about which en-
lightenment would do good. It is pathetic
to say that Australia has done more develop-
ment in 100 years than any other country
ever did. Tn the first place, so many matters
go to make up development that the state-
ment is too loose to be worth making. In
the second place, only the Lord knows what
every country has done in every century since
Original Hairy Man first began to indulge
in centuries. As to the matter of railways,
in which all countries had a chance to start
abreast about a century ago, the Common-
wealth ranks 23rd, or two from the bottom,
for quantity of railways in proportion to
area, in a list of 25 quoted in the last
“Official Year Book.” Mexico is No. 21.
The two below us are Brazil and Egypt
which, by reason of their navigable rivers,
could develop to a great extent along the
age-old water tracks. This land of ours is
at the top for quantity of railway in pro-
portion to population, but the eight sepa-
rate gauges are a drawback, and there seems
no earthly prospect of the conflicting or
stagnant Governments doing anything with
them. A worse drawback is that every
copper of the face value of the lines is
owed abroad, and a great deal more. Aus-
tralia doesn’t really own a spike. It suffers
from more than the ordinary drawbacks of
Private Enterprise, inasmuch as its variety
of private capitalist demands liis dividend
whether it is earned or not, and it gains
none of the advantages of real Private Enter-
prise, which likes to get a land-grant in the
wilds and build out there to make it profit-
able, whereas Australia’s alleged Public
Enterprise hangs about tlie cities looking
for votes. Australia has no cross-country
railway from sea to sea, as Russia, India,
Argentina, Mexico, Canada and the United
States have. The last two have them in
quantity. It hasn’t even a dead-end line
into the interior to remotely compare with
the one which leads north from Capetown.
Between Cloncurry in tlie east and Marble
Bar in the west, Oodnadatta to the south
and Katherine River to tlie north, lies half
Australia or more without a railway or
the prospect of one, though the South-to-
North highway was paid for by S. Australia
with a great land-grant years ago. Save for
tne opening about nine years back of a
56-mile narrow-gauge extension, ending on
the bank of an unbridged river, even the
fringes of this great block haven’t been
disturbed in tlieir holy commercial calm for
ages. It is practically without anything
which can be called a road, save by courtesy,
the guff about the incomparable and all-
pervading highways of the Commonwealth
being for city consumption. Settlement is
blocked by the ordinary freight charge of
2s. 6d. per ton per mile. No higher rate
was quoted in Captain Cook’s time.
* * * *
The non-pioneering Bruce frame of mind,
and that of all the Bruces, is marked by his
congratulatory assurance that Sydney will
soon be the second city of the Empire. This
most thinly-peopled dominion can’t afford
to strip the countryside hare of inhabitants
that it may bo cursed with the Second Big-
gest Bloat in so big an empire. There is
strong suspicion that at present half the
Commonwealth is losing population—Tas-
mania, Victoria outside Melbourne, western
N. S. Wales and Queensland, the Northern
Territory and a large section of Westralia.
Australia leads the world in its gross (hut
diminished) stock of sheep, which is to say
that it lias 34 times as many as the United
Kingdom, and the U.K. is not quite one-
third the size of South Australia. As a
raiser of cattle, horses and pigs, it is far
down the list. Its States are not known to
be all loaded up with coal. Its wheat crop
is the Commonwealth’s great agricultural
standby; yet it is a good year in which it
turns out as many bushels as Italy, where
wheat is a side-line. The entire area under
cultivation is about one-fourtli that of Italy.
For this backwardness the closed ports, the
congested cities and the needless railway dis-
tances may be held largely responsible. The
congestion craze also makes for shocking defi-
ciencies in the educational direction. The
facilities for learning trades in country towns
are miserably small, and in the cities they
are small also. Regulations restricting the
number of learners are in amazing profusion,
hut any restriction on the multiplication of
laborers and odd-jobbers is unheard of.
There have even been eases of men asking
to he declared habitual criminals that they
might acquire in gaol the trade knowledge
which is so hard to get outside. As for
higher education, it can only be obtained as
a general thing by those who live in one of
the six capitals, or are rich enough to re-
move there. According to the ideas enter-
tained in some countries, the supply is
wretchedly inadequate, though the quality is
good. As a random instance, Kansas is an
agricultural inland State of George Wash-
ington’s country, about the size of Vic-
toria. and only created in 1801. so that it
may he called a contemporary. It compares
with the Commonwealth thus:—
Kansas. Australia.
Area (square miles) . . . . 82,158 2,974,581
Population (census) . . . . 1,769,257 5,435,734
Universities . . . . . . 6‘ 6 1
Towns provided with Universities 6 6
Teaching staff . . . . .. 689 511
Students 9,666 8,570
And of the Australian students 800 were
merely learning music. South Africa, with
one-sixth the Commonwealth’s area and a
little over one-fourth its white population,
maintains nine universities in nine different
towns. Further, the Australian Government
lias practically no army, has no police, no
legal right to interfere except by State per-
mission even if six civil wars are raging at
once, and apparently no Court which can
compel reasonable civility from Thomas
Walsh.
* * * *
There are chances in Australia which
would gladden the inmost soul of. a great
constructive statesman, with a craving to do
big things, and to leave his name in big
letters emblazoned on big monuments. But
the local Pograms and Fladdocks, who
have all the self-satisfaction of the originals
without their picturesque truculence, hate
to he disturbed amid their grazing in the
paddocks of contentment.
LANG AND AN ANCIENT EVIL.
In August last, after what was described as
“an exhaustive investigation,” a Select Com-
mittee o.f the N. S. Wales Leg. Assembly re-
ported against proprietary control of the
malodorous pony-racing business. Some of
its remarks are subjoined:—
Non-proprietary racing is in the best interests of
the racing community and the public generally.
Investigation into the formation and subsequent
development of the various pony clubs shows that
immense sums have been earned. Certain clubs
have been many times reconstructed, and the origi-
nal shareholders appear to have been inordinately
advantaged at the expense of those competing for
the prize-money offered.
Recommended that “the [pony] clubs be formed
into non-proprietary clubs” with an association oi
their own, “the governing body of such association
to control their affairs, subject to the rules and en-
dorsement of the A.J.C.”
The report was mainly a Labor production,
five of the nine committeemen being Labor
members. The chairman was R. E. O’Hal-
loran, tlic party’s secretary, and the other
four were T. D. Mutch, now Minister for
Education: George Gann, now Minister for
Health and Ixical Government; F. Burke,
of the Public Works Committee; and R.
Greig, now Chairman of Committees. For
this reason it is expected that the Lang
Government will retrieve the report, which
Fuller and co. pigeonholed, with a view to
action, especially as it has a bone to pick
with the pony-racing press.
* * * *
But if this expectation is realised the Govern-
ment will require more information than the
report furnishes, nor will the recommenda-
tions help it much. The committee touched
only the fringe of the subject it was appointed
to tackle. It shirked giving an opinion as
to whether pony-racing serves any useful
purpose, or as to whether Sydney needs four
pony clubs, eight horse clubs (including the
trotting bodies), a dozen suburban race-
courses (excluding Menangle, Wyong
and Gosford), and three or four meet-
ings a week, sometimes five or six.
Neither did it mention the epidemic of start-
ing-price betting, nor discuss the racecourse
bookmaker or the totalisator. It didn’t even
suggest a basis for the conversion of the
proprietaries into non-proprietary clubs. One
of the pony institutions values its racecourse
property at £64,000 and its “rights and good-
will” at £254,000, the “rights,” etc., consist-
ing of nothing more tangible than the hope
that it will be permitted to hold meetings
exempt from the operation of the anti-
gambling laws, as at present. The public
will gain nothing if these “rights” are con-
ceded and clubs alleged to be non-proprietary
aie permitted to make huge profits, with no
diminution of racing. If that is what
Mutch and Cann have in mind they may as
well let matters remain as they are.
* * * *
A Government honestly desirous of re-
forming the horse-and-pony-gamhling busi-
ness on commonsense lines would go in for
the following measures:—
Abolition of pony-racing by the refusal of licenses
to pony clubs as such. This course was adopted years
ago in South Aus. and Westralia with eminently
satisfactory results.
Proprietary clubs,' pony and horse, to be made
non-proprietary under the jurisdiction of the A.J.C.,
and allowed to earn 10 p.c. p.a. on the valuation
ot their land and improvements. “Rights,” ; “good-
will” and watered stock to be ignored in the scheme
of conversion. If the shareholders in three or four
of the. proprietary tracks would prefer to sell to the
municipal bodies; so much the better. - Sydney is
surfeited with racecourses, but it could do,with more
football- and, cricket-grounds, especially in places
like Rosebery and Zetland.
Restriction of racing to Saturdays and holidays.
Sixty-eight meetings per annum ought to be enough
for any population that has got to work for it'
living. Week-day meetings are a curse. *
Abolition of all forms of s.-p. betting. This could
be brought about by prohibiting the publication of
handicaps and the like, except in official books, to be
sold only on the course. ft is a drastic remedy,
but the disease is serious, for s.-p. betting has be-
come a veritable plague. It is a factor in the
hideous slumminess of working-class districts, a
cause of industrial unrest and inefficiency, a source
of waste and crime. If people must bet, let them
go to the racecourse, where, at least, they can back
their fancy with knowledge as to the jockey and the
barrier position—information denied to the stay-at-
home punter—and with the assurance that the coun-
try will get its cut if they lose. The shop- or street-
bookie is a tax-dodger as well as a loafer and a
harpy. Consolidated revenue is denied any portion
of his profits, which are so huge that he.can afford
to pay his agents 10 p.e. of the money that passes
through their hands. He uselessly absorbs wealth
that the Government will need for its industrial
banks.
Reduction of the totalisator tax to 5 p.c., as in
Queensland, conditionally upon the clubs installing
10s. and ss. straightout, and place machines; This
expedient would do away • with half the bookmakers
how fielding on Sydney racecourses, and the others
could be attended to later. Of £2,674,606 toted
on ten metropolitan racecourses last year, the public
got back a mere 86.3 p.c., which is not giving the
machine a fair chance. The Government collected
9 p.c. ( £240,714) and the,clubs 34 p.c.( £93,613), the
latter also retaining 1.12 p.c. in fractions (~£29,850)
and .08 p.c. in unclaimed dividends ( £2117). The
suggestion is that the Government should take 5 p.e.,
unclaimed dividends and fractions, and the clubs
34 p.c.
Such measures would do more for the
“class” which the Lang Government is sup-
posed to specially represent than even the
universal adoption of the 44-liour week.
NEW FORCES IN OLD CATHAY.
It would be: hard to find anything more lux-
urious than house-boat travelling in China.
You sit in an easy-chair on the little half-
deck forward of your cabin, your head car-
ried along a little higher than the level of
the banks. There are green hills in the dis-
tance, the fields are flashing green,. and a
kindly curtain of grass and blue and yellow
wild flowers is drawn over the endless pro-
cession of grave-mounds that pass you on
either hand. No European landscape could
provide one-lialf the mental food. On the
gravemounds, on tombstones, the carved
stone doors of family crypts, the memorials
to famous widows who refused to remarry,
beautifully engraved characters record the
virtues and exploits of the previous genera-
tions that the land supported. On the long
stretches, with wind abeam, you set a ragged
sail, bringing it down with the bamboo mast
to the deck every now and then to pass under
the arch of a graceful bridge, dignified by
a splendid name and guarded by a little,
shrine to T’u Ti, god of travellers. With
wind and tide opposing, you send two men
ashore with a long towrope fastened to the
masthead ; but mostly you are lulled by the
gentle swaying of the yuloh, the great stern
sweep which drives you along at four or five
miles an hour.
There is activity in every field. Men and
women are planting out the rice-crop, boys
are standing statuesquely on queer-shaped
harrows dragged through the mud by fat
pink buffaloes. All the country is being irri-
gated. Little spouting streams are being
drawn up from the canals into the fields by
wonderfully ingenious devices worked by
human hands or legs, or by blindfolded bul-
locks revolving endlessly in a circle whose
centre is a tree provided for its shade. People
are fishing from the banks with strange-
shaped seines, and men in boats are fishing
with cormorants or dredging the mud for
shellfish with baskets on long poles which
open and close automatically ; and you pass
half-acres of ducks being shepherded to
market by their owner, who stands in a punt
driving Ins flock before him as a shep-
herd drives his sheep. There is no end to
the procession of cargo-boats and crammed
ferries streaming along before the wind.
In another corner of the province and at
the same time, civil war is raging, and
not 40 miles astern is a great industrial
centre that might have been transported com-
plete from Europe. In order to understand
liow China can be tormented by the twin
devils of civil war and foreign industry and
yet keep serenely along her ancient wav
it is necessary to remember that the ebul-
litions of popular passion of which so much
is made are confined to the treaty ports and
the great cities, and behind them lies, still
inert but possibly nearer awakening than we
reckon, the huge, unwieldy mass of an old
civilisation and a population sufficient to
stock a minor star. It is with these surface
movements, however, that the foreign nations
have to deal, and as there are thousands of
Europeans scattered throughout China, the
consequences of any hasty action by the
Powers have to be considered.
Chinese statesmen have a reputation for
showing the white feather in the face of
popular excitement, and the action of Feng,
the Christian general, and Chang, the Man-
churian viceroy, in backing the students in
their present agitation against foreigners,
is in accordance with tradition; nevertheless,
there are many notable exceptions. When
the notorious Empress-Dowager T/f tt-tlsi
sent out her famous Boxer edict ordering the
extirpation of all foreigners, two Pekin man-
darins, in the copy that passed through their
hands, deliberately altered the character
“exterminate” to “protect.” When the liasty-
tempered Empress, who still believed the
Boxers were invulnerable, although they were
daily being sent to Heaven by the rifle-fire
from the Legations, heard of the two Pekin


patriots’ action, she immediately invited
i hem to “swallow gold.” That they had
acted in their country’s best interests was
shown by the fact that Manchuria, where the
superstitious lady’s orders were carried out,
was promptly over-run by Russian troops.
The present anti-foreign movement, if it
receives official sanction, will probably re-
sult in serious consequences for the world
in general. The London Times has strongly
advocated intervention, and many of the
1 ’owers are eager to have a shot at this solu-
tion of a problem that is tending to grow
tedious. It is a solution that was proposed
as long ago as 1898, and then seemed
imminent to such a shrewd observer as the
late Lord Curzon, who wrote grandilo-
quently of a British China, more populous,
splendid and remunerative than British
India. But the problem is very different
now than when the somnolent Eastern giant
was raising one eyelid reluctantly on the
Western world. The break-up of the numb-
ing authority of the Central Government,
symbolised by the Son of Heaven and his
harem of wives and eunuchs in Pekin, has
released rejuvenating streams of energy in
every province. Although the peasant son of
llau still stands on his simple harrow
dragged through the mud of the ricefields by
sad-eyed water-buffaloes, in every city the
students are reading their daily newspapers
and organising their forces by post and tele-
graph for the great resorgimento. It is
possible that Western people know less about
China than China now knows of the Western
world ; for, whereas there are few foreigners
• who can read the native press and the litera-
ture of the new awakening, there are mil-
lions of Chinese who can and do read Eng-
lish and other foreign literature or have the
thought of the modern world presented to
them by armies of translators. The diffi-
culties of having 45,000 characters instead
of an alphabet to deal with are steadily being
overcome. At one time Chinese users of
the telegraph were confined to the medium
of English, until the ingenious expedient of
a group of figures for each character was
devised. The increase in the telegraph traffic
by this simple device was enormous, and an-
other invention which will revolutionise the
Chinese newspaper office has followed. It
is a linotype designed to set the Chinese and
Japanese languages by machinery. The
Chinese compositor still has to walk a mile
to set a paragraph, and the type-setting room
still contains thousands of little pigeon-
holes from which the characters must be
abstracted, and to which they must after-
wards be returned by hand. The new in-
vention will probably quadruple the influ-
ence of the press. That influence is almost
entirely in the hands of the young students.
Many of them are frankly Bolshevik, and all
have a hatred of Western industrialism and
all its works. They have achieved a form
of Soviet control of their schools and uni-
versities, and the old Confucian pedants with
their stately manners and unstained literary
souls have been brushed aside. They have
fathered a new religion, a strange amalgam
of spiritualism, Confucianism and Chris-
tianity, and their hatred of the foreign mis-
sionary, who is the symbol of Western dis-
ruption masquerading under moral guise, is
intense. Recent happening# indicate that
many of the military tuchuns, who command
between them over a million soldiers, are in-
clined to follow in the popular direction.
Next to his smell, which the Chinese finds
strange and intolerable, the most disagree-
able trait the foreigner has in Chinese eyes
is his impatience. The Chinese people have
unseated their tyrants many times before.
The “time of trouble” that has intervened
between the destroying of one despot and
the erection of another has varied from 20
to 200 years. The endeavor to implant
Democracy in place of the Mancliu Emperor
on the Peacock Throne has only lasted to
date a matter of 14: and the anxiety of
the foreigner to expedite the process in the
interests of his business is resented by every
Celestial patriot. If the ambition takes too
obvious and active a direction, it mat have
the effect of consolidating China, with Rus-
sian, German and possibly Japanese help,
against the rest of the world.

Whisky and Pants and Ships.
When the delayed storm of disapprobation
burst over the Prime Minister’s spats in the
House of Representatives the subject of re-
proach was, as a matter of course, the placing
of orders for two new cruisers in Great Bri-
tain instead of having them constructed
locally by day labor. The party which
panted so ardently to have them built locally
didn’t really want them built at all, but that
discrepancy failed to damp the ardor of its
frenzy. These two cruisers have become a
species of mania with the Charltons and
Ansteys and Mahonys, and, though the
excitement into which these politicians
lash themselves and each other may
be hypocrisy, there are signs of method
in the madness. The importation of
woollen piece goods alone represents
about two cruisers in an ordinary year,
and the importation of whisky stands for
about one cruiser per year; and both these
outlays are preventable if a ‘reasonable
amount of energy was concentrated on the
work. A comparison between whisky and
ships, with a side glance at pants, may be
made thus; —
The reason why Australia imports its whisky,
while it manufactures most of its other forms of
blue ruin, is that the second-rate Australian liquor
has no Protection at all as against second-rate
imported stuff, while the Protection granted to the
first-rate Australian product as against second-rate
and cheaper imported fluid is too small to be worth
naming.
Yet the making of whisky, like the making of
woollens, is a continuous industry, while the build-
ing of cruisers, unless there is to be a notable
reform in defence policy, is a solitary business, or
at least one with long and uncertain intervals
between. A decade of monopoly means the making
of ten whiskies or ten woollens for certain, but a
decade of monopoly may only furnish employment at
the making of two cruisers or less.
There is no visible reason why Australia shouldn t
build up an export trade in whisky and woollens,
but an export trade in cruisers doesn’t seem to be
even imagined. We can make the first two articles
up to the world’s highest standard, but about the
third there is total lack of encouraging evidence.
Suspicions are entertained that cruiser-building will
be, to a great extent, the putting together of
imported parts—in other* words, that so many small
workshops would be required for the making of
parts that the business would be ridiculous unless
cruisers were to be a steady occupation. There is
no such fitting together of imported parts in Aus-
tralian drink, or in Australian clothing material
either.
Further, in the building of a vessel of war, speed
is almost as much the essence of the contract as
quality. That kind of craft becomes obsolete very
fast, and if it is half out of date before it takes
the water, the country pays for a whole ship and
gets only 50 per cent, of one. The Australian
Government, being at present in a state of utter pros-
tration and helplessness over waterside matters, has
no speed in its repertoire, so this is the woi'st possible
time to launch out in the proposed form of enter-
prise. On the other hand, woollen pants are not
liable to become out of date, and spirituous refresh-
ment of good quality has never been obsolete yet, and
has never arrived on the market too late to command
a sale.
Still there are features about the spasmodic
trade of cruiser-making which fully explain
its passionate advocacy in certain quarters.
It is a purely big-city industry under Aus-
tralian conditions, while the making of food
and drink and raiment can be pursued any-
where provided the materials are handy. It
brings together large bodies of men where
they can be addressed conveniently on strikes
and kindred topics. And it represents Pub-
lic Enterprise, which the Communist variety
of person holds in esteem because it proves
so amenable to persecution.

Dual Buffers on Narrow-gauge Lines.
From an old railwayman:—
As a railwayman of long standing, I venture the
opinion that double buffers on coaches running over
narrow-gauge lines are contributory to wheels jumping
off the rails; and although I will not go so far
as to say the Traveston Greek disaster is a case in
point, there is a possibility that the buffers had
something to do with the derailment.
I found evidence in favor of my opinion that two
buffers were a menace instead of additional safety
when, a little over a year ago, I surveyed the damaged
carriage of the Mt. Perry (Q.) accident, standing
near the main line at Bundaberg in full view of
timid railway-travelling people. And again the
thought came to me on my last visit to the Northern
State. We were running half an hour late out of
N. S. Wales, and at Wallangarra one of the squat
powerful Bananaland engines pulled up alongside our
coach. Two N. S. Wales loco, men, passengers to
Brisbane, “chipped” the driver and fireman about
the engine they manned. “Yes,” came the reply, when
it was known the scoffers were southern railwaymen,
“your railway lost half an hour ; this is the engine
that will pick it up for you. We run to time-table
here.” They did, too, with a vengeance. It was
one of the most exciting railway rides I’ve ever
had; we swayed, reeled and jolted like a tramp
steamer crossing the Bight in stormy weather. It
only meant one buffer-spring snapping, and Australia
would be ringing with the news. The loco, men
from the other State got the wind up, and I don’t
mind admitting I thought our next stop was the
capital of Heaven.
The Queensland railway buffers are nearly as large
as chair-bottoms, and perfectly flat on the surface of
the discs where they meet each other. With a
set each side there is too great a rigidity in the
coaches following hell-for-leather around the sharp
curves. Each vehicle should, except for its pull, be
a separate entity, like a good rider on a bucking
horse. If a rider rode stiff on his mount, trying to
be part of his horse instead of merely keeping above
its back, he’d soon be in the dust. It is exactly
the same way with a speeding rake of coaches. When
there are acute curves to negotiate, a free and easy
following is necessary.
I base my argument on comparison with Westralia
in so far as narrow gauges and different systems of
buffers are concerned. The Jarrah State is happily
almost free of big railway accidents, and holds the
world’s record for fast travelling— i.e., the Eastern
Goldfields 500-mile run —over a 3ft. 6in. gauge. The
only notable disaster to date happened a number of
years back, at Poison Gully, a few miles out of
Midland Junction. But that had nothing to do
with the rigidness of the train. Heavy rains from
the hills had rendered ,the gully the same as it was
before the construction gangs laid the metal rails
across. The fast mixed came to a jumbled full stop,
killed the fireman and driver, and damaged a quantity
of rolling-stock. Now, the Westralian railway
carriages are single-buffered, the discs being about
11 inches in diameter, with a convex surface. Natu-
rally, the buffer is situated in the centre of the
coach end, and is heavily shouldered to within 4in.
of the vehicle—that much play on a heavy double
spring, one nested in the other, of about Yin. in
length. The coupling is effected right on the buffer
by a heavy chopper which falls in a vertical opening-
in the buffer-disc and grips a movable pin and is
bridled on in a simple fashion, allowing disconnection
in a minimum of time. In case this pin should
break away, the safety or drag chains come into
operation, one of these being each side of the
buffer, easily hooked or unhooked.
Looking at it from all points, including cost,
Bananaland could well discard her two-buffer system
and take a lesson from the other Australian State
with great experience of narrow-gauge systems.

Battleship Cruises, Past and Present.
A London newspaper asserts that the British
Cabinet recently discussed the possibility of
war breaking out between Japan and the
U.S.A. while the American battleships are in
Australian waters, and of the battleships
having to be ordered to quit within 24 hours
to avoid a breach of neutrality. The story
may be untrue, but it serves to recall what
the late President Roosevelt said of the
battleship squadron which he sent this way
in 1908. Roosevelt’s words are given in
“Talks with T.R.,” by J. .1. Leary, an Irish-
American journalist who was on intimate
terms with him for years, and their authen-
ticity has not been questioned, as far as is
known:—
Two of the brightest chapters in America's
brilliant naval history deal with Dewey in Manila
Bay and the battleship cruise round the w0r1d....
There has been much mystery and some dispute as
to the orders under which Evans sailed. “I said
to Evans, said Colonel Roosevelt, discussing the
matter, Admiral, I am very fond of you but if
you or your ships are surprised in port or’ at sea
don’t come back to me.’ ‘Mr. President,’ said he!
if I am surprised I won’t come back.’ The situa-
tion was serious, and Evans knew it nearly* if not
as h T i le . re was one chance in ten
that the trip would end in war. I decided to take
the nine chances that would prevent the war that
seemed certain—was certain if strong measures were
not taken to prevent it. I was talking softly to
Japan and, in the fleet, was letting it see mv bio-
stick. I knew Fighting Bob could be depended
upon not to pick a light, but, by George! I knew,
and Japan knew, that if occasion demanded, he
could fight and would fight.”
Conditions have changed, of course, sinco
1908. In those days there was no thought
of that supreme achievement of pacifism, the
Washington Conference, which expressly
provided that Japan, the U.S.A. and the three
other Powers concerned might build as many
10,000-ton cruisers, destroyers and sub-
marines as they pleased. The Washington
Conference has had a mighty influence on poli-
tical thought in this country, the Labor party,
which stood for a strong Australian Navy in
1908, being now opposed to the building of
warships, except for unemployed-relief pur-
poses, like sand-shifting ; and the effects may
have been equally magical in America and
Japan. Perhaps the object of the present
battleship cruise is merely to demonstrate
how clever County’s gunners are at shoot-
ing cocoanuts off the tree. Time, which ex-
plains so many things, will tell.

Our Lost Gaol Population.
Australia’s gaol population isn’t increasing
as it ought to. And in some big cities such
gaol population as exists isn’t in nearly long
enough, gets out too easily by climbing over
the wall, or by appeal, or by winning a
pardon from some maudlin Minister, and is
so weakly-guarded while in that the situation
almost amounts to job-control by the in-
mates. In fact, there is very little doubt
that a proposal will yet be mooted for repre-
sentative institutions “inside,” the governor
being “assisted” by an elected committee of
offenders. Small cities are not widely dif-
ferent from big ones. There is no lack of
crime to account for the remarkable scarcity
of prisoners, the crop being rather above the
average. For this various reasons are
assigned, including Communist teaching, the
glorification of hoodlumism in imported films,
and the circumstance that far too few youths
have a chance to acquire trades (which leads to
the point that there is far too much importa- *
tion and far too few trades), wherefore a
disastrously large proportion grows up in
the laborer and odd-job category, which is
even more demoralising than estate-agency.
Another certain cause is the insufficiency
of swift, capable, übiquitous men to collect
offenders at the shortest notice. In Sydney
about a dozen unpleasant characters have been
wanted for months for a murderous act done
before an audience in an ill-lighted and un-
policed city park, and not one unpleasant
character has been gathered in, nor does one
seem likely to. More recently it was proved
that a white man could be maltreated by
imported niggers for a quarter of an hour in
a well-peopled part of the same town with-
out the Law looming on the horizon even by
accident. The number of dead bodies which
await explanation is considerable, and the
assortment of minor crimes which call for
particulars is amazing. An important point
in this connection is that a citizen may dwell
for a couple of years in the midst of a large
and well-occupied suburb like Woollalira and
not see an evidence that the Law exists unless
a large officer comes round on the girl’s or
old man’s business of jotting down names
for the electoral-roll. Therefore the house-
hold that can afford it keeps its private gun,
and probably subscribes £5 or £6 a year to-
wards the upkeep of a private watchman.
If it is a small household this outlay
goes some way towards doubling its
State taxation. Melbourne, where bush-
ranging is now too common to be
worth mentioning. is probably worse
than Sydney. The ill-paid force is
vigorous enough if it happens to be there
when the criminal is. but owing to circum-
stances over which it has little control the
chance is much the same as that of light-
ning striking a given tree on Ash Wednes-
day. It is asserted, though possibly with
some exaggeration, that 80 per cent, of so-
called police duties in Victoria have no-
thing at all to do with the pursuit or preven-
tion of crime, extending even to the service
of petty-debt summonses. It is also asserted,
without any exaggeration, that Australia’s
idea of policing a country is unique, like
its kangaroo and some of its foliage. Tin-
whole Commonwealth maintained a force
6990 strong at last advices. Scotland, de-
spite its economical cast of thought and
its porridge diet, buys itself a force of 6530.
Therefore it has. roughly speaking, 90 times
as many “cops” to a given area as this
country possesses, and being inside a. given
area is a great help towards prompt arrest.
In England and Wales, where economy is
less proverbial, the police strength is about
450 times that of Australia per scijiare mile.
Even in proportion to population Great
Britain is much more heavily copned than
the Commonwealth is. It is time this. coun-
try took all its defensive arms more seriously.

Rhodes Scholarships.
From a man in a professorial job:—
Somebody, speaking in Melbourne, said that no
Rhodes scholar has taken a leading place in the politics
oi Australia; and, commenting upon that, one who
is apparently a Rhodes scholar questions (B. 4/6/’25)
whether the scheme is working out well. What
extraordinarily limited notions appear to be abroad
as to what public service means! There would
appear to be no avenue of public service to the
community except via the Houses of Parliament!
It must be remembered that before one can enter
Parliament he must have some steady source of
income and be in the public eye, that most Rhodes
scholars are poorly off financially and have to make
a position for themselves before they can think of
Parliament, and that when they get there their
individual influence on the lives of the people amounts
to very little. So most of them have chosen other
ways. In Victoria —I choose Victorians because 1
know more of them than I do of those in other
States —any thinking man can see that the majority
of the scholars are individually exerting as great
an influence on the inner life of the community as
any politician Australia ever produced. Eighty or
90 per cent, of these men have deliberately chosen
work of human service at small salaries, though
all of them would probably have made large incomes
in other walks of life. They have recognised that
educational work gives the most powerful oppor.
tunities for exerting their influence, and all of them
occupy posts in which that influence can most
strongly be applied, not only on other individuals,
but in the direction of educational methods. Several
have taken up research work and have had the
satisfaction of seeing their work recognised in
other countries as distinct contributions to human
knowledge. Thus the vast majority are applying
their knowledge to the service of the people, quietly
doii.g their work without fuss and noise. Hardly
any have used their scholarships as a means of
increasing their money-making capacity. If all this
is not what Cecil Rhodes wanted, then 1 have yet
to learn what he did want. Victoria, -at any rate,
has every reason to be proud of her Rhodes scholars.

The Ashes of C. R. Das.
It is a prevalent delusion that when the
iridescent bubbles known as politicians burst,
the movement on which they float is doomed
to fade away or lose its punch. A case in
point is the sensation caused by the death
of C. R. Das, Mayor of Calcutta and so-
called leader of the Indian extremists. Nearly
half a million people assembled to see the
body of the dead Hindu carried to the burn-
ing ghat, and the papers, even his own, pro-
phesied that the movement that works by
obstruction in the Government and by knife
and bomb outside is doomed to early demise
also. It is doubtful, however, whether the
future historian of India will give Das and
his fellow-workers more than half a “stick’
of type. Indian unrest owes its existence
not to the manoeuvres of one picturesque in-
dividual but to the ceaseless activity of 50
million Indian mothers. The tortuous stra-
tegy of the person who moved a resolution
applauding an Indian patriot for having
murdered an Englishman has no influence
on the inexorable fact that the fecundity of
the 50 million mothers has reduced the aver-
age area of tillable land per head to less
than acres and will in the future inevi-
tably reduce it further. Various devices
have been employed to remedy this unfor-
tunate condition, including the Montaou-
Chelmsfobd report, irrigation works, mod
ern industries, swaraj, Amritsar shooting*
and non-co-operation. Previous to British
interference Nature adjusted the matter more
or less with wars, famines, pestilences and
puerperal fever; since 1872, when these anti-
dotes began steadily to be withdrawn by
humanitarian white men, the population' has
grown from 206 millions to 319 millions,
which is an increase of over 54 per cent, in
half a century, while the average income has
not conspicuously expanded and now stands
at £6 to £9 per head per annumj also the
real wages of the Indian cocky laborer,
round about three-eighths of a shilling per
day in 1900, are now lower than the pre-war
level or depression by 6 per cent. The fact
that S2B babies die out of every 1000 born in
Bombay indicates that Nature is once more
taking'a hand ; but the warning isn’t much
heard in the polyglot uproar that passes for
politics in India. Most of the blame for the
trouble is laid at the door of the British
Government, and that harassed institution is
also expected to find a solution. In the mean-
time the lady who is responsible is confirmed
in her disastrous habits by several funda-
mental religious notions which nothing but a
revolution is likely to endanger. One is that
a girl about the house who remains unmarried
after puberty means social disgrace for the
family and everlasting damnation for its
ancestors. Another is that a pntra (boy) is
one who saves his father’s soul from Hell
( puta ). and that the more boys there are the
less likelihood there will be of the old map
having to suffer in the next world for his:
sins in this. In such circumstances the
chances of an Indian statesman arising to>
successfully preach birth-control to Indiiains.
are as light as the ashes of the respected
C. R. Das, now floating down the Hooghlh"-

The Ladies and the Tigers.
In a once very popular short story. “The
Lady and the Lion,” the reader is left to
solve the question whether the lady, whose
lover is engaged in a life-or-death struggle
in the amphitheatre, will in a fit of jealousy
turn down her thumb and give the lion a
meal or turn it up and save the life of the
estranged but still beloved young man. No
doubt of this kind arises in the Melbourne
story of the ladies and their wild beasts.. All
the trouble arose out of the cold business
views of the local Zoo authorities. Wirths’
Circus had certain animals with which the
Zoo could do, and the Zoo had three tiger-
cubs, Suzette, Joan and Andrew, that could
be well done without. The parties accord-
ingly arranged a swap, three cubs for so
many other animals. Now, Suzette and the
other two had been reared from the tender
age of 11 days by a lady with the kindly
name of Homewood, but in view of future
possibilities she had surrendered their guar-
dianship to the keepers of wild beasts. The
proprietors of the circus had, of course, a
practical end before them. They proposed
to educate the young tigers and make them
a source of pride and profit to the showman.
On hearing this there was a great outcry
from the ladies. “Helena,” “Luxtj,” “Elsie’
and many others wrote indignantly to the
press, one protesting against a vagrant circus
life for the pets, another against “such a
fate” for the darlings, and so on. It is all
very pathetic, and of course quite nice of
the ladies; but it suggests a few thoughts to
the philosopher. To him it seems something:
like a sentimental overflow from the modem:
attitude towards the tiger-cubs in the com-
munity. For are we not in danger of adopt-
ing much the same view of our juvenile delin-
quents as these ladies have taken about
Suzette, Joan and Andrew?
Shrinking the Earth.
Television is the latest wonder of the age.
This must not be confused with the transmis-
sion of photographs, which had been done
experimentally before the war. The new
invention involves the collecting of the
light-waves sent out by a moving _ or
stationary object, tljeir conversion into
corresponding waves of electricity—which,
by the way, have the same frequency
—their conveyance aerially or over wires
through space, and their reassembling at the
point of reception into light-waves again. The
little arrangement that makes the marvel
possible is a cell composed of metal super-
sensitive to light. Selenium is such a metal,
and has been used for many years for the
quick relaying of signals under sea. As
light is flashed upon it and withdrawn its
resistance varies rapidly, and it is a simple
matter to convert the variations in ohmic
value into pulsations of electric Current

reason why any amateur can fix up an effi-

That is the prime virtue of the valve. Syn-

tricky operation, even for a competent en-
gineer.

Opium Runners of the North.
“Rex” : The opium traffic offers the shortest
cut to fortune in North Queensland. Traffick-
ers, penniless to-day, may be rich next year
if they are prepared to take a risk. And with
lax supervision and light penalties the risk
is trifling. Cairns, being the first port of
call from Hastern Asia, is naturally the home
of the business —or one of its homes. “Run-
ners” are constantly employed taking opium
to Atherton. Innisfail and intermediate sta-
tions. The big stakes, however, go to about
four families—three whites and one yel-
low—of whom the chief is a man
whose alleged legitimate business serves
as a cloak for the lucrative line of
opium-running. It is not considered wise
by these Get-Rich-Quick Walling fords to
bank all the money they receive. They put much
of it into property, and most payments are
made in cash. They purchase elegant homes
in which to live, fit them with such luxuries
as the wealthiest sugar-growers cannot afford,
and their feet are firmly planted on Easy-
street. Yet no royal commission is required
to stop the traffic. All that is needed is a
live detective who knows his business and
cannot be bought. The job of catching the
runners is too big for the ordinary police
or Customs officials. That, at any rate, is
the kindest assumption. But of what avail
would convictions be without imprisonment
of the offenders? Fines of £SOO to people
who make over £SOOO a year out of the busi-
ness are absurd. There should be only one
kind of punishment for those who traffic in
human lives, and that is imprisonment.
There are really a multitude of mixed con-
siderations hanging on to the question of
white settlement in the tropics, and these
are some of them:—
The white man, who has been settled in the tropics
for four centuries or so, has done nothing to prove
that the tropics are unfit for his habitation. The
early settlers began under difficulties and continued
under them. These included a long period of abso-
lute government, managed from a distance by par-
ticularly ignorant and incapable rulers; religious
intolerance, and the fact that what -was called
education was long in the hands of a religious
institution many of whose ministers were themselves
barely able to read. The newcomers inherited the
utterly demoralising slave habit, just as the United
States did, but they got it much earlier and had
it much longer, and it was diffused much more
widely. With it came to them, as it did to the
proud and starchy white of Carolina and Louisiana,
an idea of the indignity of manual toil. They were
encumbered with a vastly larger colored population
than other white settlers in new regions, and as it
wasn’t sufficiently dark or savage to be wholly
despised, there was too much mixed marriage. And
the strangers came of two European races whicri
never showed much of the manufacturing instinct, or
much capacity for the methods of popular govern-
ment.
Yet the white man who has been longest in the
tropics, when his blood is still pure European, hasn’t
fallen away from the merits (nor from some of
the defects) of his ancestors in any noticeable way,
either physical or mental. His people are nor
vanishing like those of Ireland or Celtic Scotland.
The white man, judged by results, is showing
himself better fitted for tropical life than the tinted
one. It must be kept in mind that the Japanese
are not tropical, nor the Chinese, apart from a
small patch about Canton, nor the great building-
races of India (that country is mostly in the
temperate zone), nor the Afghan, Beloochee or Persian
The Egyptian is mostly outside the tropics, so are
many of the Burmese, the Arab down to and beyond
the holy city of Medina, the Tripolitan, Algerian.
Moor, Berber, and many of the Sahara folk. Per-
haps when the colored man moves more extensively
into the tropics, we may know more about his
fitness for the place. At present he is much more
outside the tropics than within them.

From the see. of the Returned Soldiers’
League:—
Regarding the soldier’s orphan mentioned in
The Bulletin (18/6/’25), I find that the child was
living with an aunt, who arranged for her custody
with a married couple. The married couple after a
time wanted the aunt to take her back. This
she refused to do. They then reported to the
Child Welfare Department that she was an un-
controllable child, as far as her guardians were
concerned. Information was then laid with the
Children's Court with a view to having the
magistrate fix her location. The magistrate remanded
the case for further information. On being remanded,
she was placed by the Children's Court officer at the
Avon-street Girls’ Shelter, Glebe. She was only
there a few days when the officer of the court who
had originally placed her in the shelter secured her
removal to the Bidura depot, as being a more suit-
able place for a girl of her type. Soon after her
removal to Bidura Home arrangements were made
by the solicitor employed by her relatives to place
her in a good home, where sire now is. The Child
Welfare Department did not become her foster-
parents, and therefore did not adopt her out for a
• consideration. Nor did it send her to the Gills’
Shelter. That step was taken by the Court, which
is a thing quite apart from the Child Welfare
Department, and under separate jurisdiction. The
failure of the aunt to take the girl off the guardians’
hands forced a reference to the Children’s Court.
The girl herself has never been under State control.
The Bulletin’s complaint was that this un-
fortunate child, the daughter of a Digger who
gave his life for liis country, was sent to the
Girls’ Shelter —a place to which young crimi-
nals are remitted—for no other offence than
that she was an orphan. This paper is little
concerned whether it was one department or
another that sent her there. It is a disgrace
to us that she was sent there at all and by
anybody.

“X.N.0.”: The Bulletin says (11/6/'25),
with regard to Sir George Buchanan’s
strictures on living conditions in the Far
“BLACK” MAGIC.
North, that there are abundance of summer
regions far south of Capricorn to which the
same remarks apply. This is quite correcr,
because tropical conditions extend much
further south of the Equator than they do
north. Two main astronomical factors regu-
late summer temperatures in any particular
spot: (1) the distance of the earth from the
sun, and (2) the thickness of the earth’s
atmosphere which the sun’s rays are re-
quired to penetrate to reach that spot. Obvi-
ously (2) is at its least when the sun is
most nearly overhead. This is the principal
consideration, afld produces northern mid-
summer in June and southern midsummer
in. December, in which months the sun is
over Cancer and Capricorn respectively. But,
owing to the elliptical shape of the earth’s
orbit round the sun, the latter is about
.‘>,000,000 miles nearer the earth in December
than in June. Hence the southern summer
is hotter than the northern, and hence, also,
tropical conditions extend further south than
they do north.
«
During the summer months the S. Aus.
Education Department conducts a camp-
school for teaching forestry at Kuitpo.
The scheme was inaugurated in 1921; and
from December to May last over 200 boys
from Adelaide suburban and country schools
were instructed. The lads have about two
weeks in the forests, with the additional bene-
fits of camp-life. Besides learning something
of arboriculture and botany, they work at
chaining, pacing, plane-tabling, pruning, mea-
suring the heights of trees and assessment of
volumes of standing trees,, and they watch all
the processes at the sawmills. They have
their sports-ground and swimming-pool, and
in the evening camp-fire talks, lectures, de-
bates and concerts. W. M. C. Symonds,
B.Se., a graduate in forestry, is the master
in charge.

Declaration-of-poll speeches are generally
pretty stodgy affairs, but this one, by Mrs.
Lyons, defeated candidate for Denison
(Tas.) and wife of the Premier, was differ-
ent. Imagine a good-looking, merry-eyed and
very eloquent young woman of 28 facing the
crowd gathered at Hobart Town Hall steps.
Imagine, also, every sentence evoking laugh-
ter and applause of the heartiest character.
Then listen :
I wouldn’t have missed this campaign for six-
pence. No man’s education is complete until he has
contested an election. Stephen Leacock, the
American humorist, says that when a man has had
conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy,
his- education is complete, “and no new idea can
possibly be imparted to him.” 1 do not go quite
so far in regard to a candidate for Parliament, but
I do say that, having been through an election
campaign, no new idea can possibly astound him,
or even mildly surprise him. There is one thing
that this election has very definitely established:
there is no such mysterious thing as the “woman’s
vote.” I received only 65 of Mrs. Waterworth'f
400 or 500 votes. That leads me to believe that I
was considered on my merits as a candidate, .and it
is very gratifying, if not highly flattering, to have
been placed only a little below Mr. Mahony and not
so very fay behind Mr. Cleary. Who knows but that
with three years’ close study and application, I may
yet be judged of equal capacity with these and
may prove a very dangerous,, opponent at the next
election ? For most assuredly I shall be there.
Nothing but the age limit prevents me from becoming
a candidate for the Legislative Council during the
next few weeks. Apart from my supporters, only
one man has expressed regret at my defeat. He
was a representative of the press, who said that lie
had missed much good copy by my having failed to
secure election. It seems to me that the press
should have a much more definite share in the
determining of elections than that which it now
enjoys.
Yet somehow the local press missed report-
ing the chippy little speech.

“Bilbao” : I would like to suggest to the
writer of “Pioneering in the North” (B.
jll/G/'25) that the Australian has no right
to throw many bricks at the “slovenly
Spaniard” for his bygone defects in Manila,
whatever they may have been. The Spaniard
amounted to no more than a handful there at
best. Ramon Castillo, or whatever his name
may be, really has done things, as witness this
description of Caracas in tropical South
America. (I am getting a new encyclopaedia,
which arrives by instalments, and it hasn't
reached Lima or Santiago yet) :
The streets, built at light angles, are broad and
well-paved. There are a handsome pronunade
numerous public parks and gardens, and a statue o'f
Bolivar. The town has excellent water and ga-
electric light, telephones, electric tramways, and is
the terminus of several railways. The most’ notable
edifices are the federal Palaces and other official
buildings, including the President’s “Yellow House’
the University (whose library is open to the public),
the Archiepiscopal Palace, the National Museum, the
Cathedral, the Exhibition Palace, the magnificent
Basilica of St. Ann, and over a score of hospital-
and charitable institut.ons. Besides the University
there are colleges of medicine, law and. engineerin';
and other technical schools, and several learned
societies, and bodies devoted to the promotion of
agriculture, industries, etc.”
That is what the “slovenly Spaniard” can do.
when he tries, with a city of 92,000 inhabi-
tants, which lives in the shadow of death.
One famous earthquake made away with
12,000 people. I have been told that the
N. S. Wales Government hasn’t sewered
Daceyville yet.

Anybody who pants for a little misery can
always get it by reading the latest report
about the Victorian Commission on soldier
settlement. It lias been from the ferny gul-
lies of Gippsland to the plains of the Western
District, and everywhere it heard the same
tale that the farms were too small and the
prices' too large and the idiots too idiotic.
It recently met 30 of its disgruntled clients
at a scrap of a place named Hawkesdale.
One complaint was that the Department in
Melbourne charged £7!) for a shed, but after-
wards thought better of it, and made the
price £239. A bumble, ready-made house
was bought on a settler’s behalf for £230,
and shifted to his farm, seven miles awa.v,
for a further £240. One man alleged that
an official architect came four times to in-
spect his shack, at £5 a time. Another said
he was charged for an architect and a fore-
man (£l6 10s. for the foreman), neither of
whom ever came at all. Other tales included
a two-roomed house supplied officially at a
price of £lBl, though a contractor was pre-
pared to furnish the same kind of box for
£4B; of four hours’ painting priced at 255.
per hour; and of a departmental person who
came 14 miles at full rates to put a latch
on a shed-door, though the tenant was really
anxious to do the work himself if only the
Department would stay away. Surely there
ought to be a point at which a politician, Uk 1
a ship captain, would lose his certificate for
gross negligence.

“Harold llardupp” : “Jock” Garden’s
couple of hundred votes in the Sydney elec
tion excite my curiosity. In the days when
Jack Cochran held the fort from widen
Jock airs his Red sentiments, there were
about 120 unions affiliated with the Trades
and Labor Council, and, although some of
them didn’t, most of them did pay their fees
regularly. Nevertheless, Cochran, on £1
per week, didn’t feel in a position to rush
all over the country on Council business. Yet
in his day he would have scored thousands
of votes —probably topped the Sydney poll
had there been a composite Sydney electorate
then. When last I inquired, the Labor Coun-
cil had 06 adherent unions, and several of
them were so annoyed with its management
that they had no enthusiasm about paying
fees. Yet Garden suffers no limitation of
activity by reason of his being connected
with this organisation, which, amongst other
frills, can run to a wireless apparatus “for
propaganda purposes.” As some unionists
would rather give their vote than an extra
bob, and only between two and three hundred
gave Garden their vote, it seems to me that
the thousands of unionists w T ho voted, in
effect, against Garden should be curious to
know who does supply the money which
always seems to be available.

“Sendjo” on .Victoria’s Reds: —
The ultra-crimson parts of Vic. Labor have also
given an illuminating display of thinking better of it
since the war. During the world squabble, three parties
of any weight comprised the van of Labor outside
the A.L.P.—the Vic. Socialist Party ; the Australian
Socialist Party, in bitter opposition to the V.S.P. ;
and the I.WAV. The Australian Socialist party’s
existence was one long snarl and sneer at those
members of the V.S.P. who had joined the A.L.P.
and were boring from within. But since those days
the A.S.P. has put its flag into pawn, and many of
its members are now white-anting for their lives,
all because “Lenin said so!” The V.S.P. has faded
from its war-time glory—many of its members have
long since skinned their knuckles in knocking at
the Parliamentary door; and Jack Cain managed
to get in early. The old I.W.W. was smashed to
fragments by the Illegal Associations Act, and most
of the members have taken to work and an occasional
flutter at the races. Out of the ashes of the A.S.P.,
the I.W.W. and the charred skeleton of the V.S.P.
the Communist party and the new I.W.W. have
arisen. The Communist party comprises recruits
from a variety of sources; the new I.W.W. has an
entirely new membership and works under a new
charter. Hardly a member of the original I.W.W.
has joined the new body, but the color of the
“local” is the same, although its beliefs are rather
old-fashioned as radical creeds go nowadays.

The Intangible Banking Label
The clothes you wear, the food you eat, every manufactured
article bears two “labels” —the tangible, visible “label of the
maker and the intangible impress of a Bank.
Before goods can be produced for your use, funds have been
deposited in a Bank, credits made available, loans granted—even
the currency you use in buying has been supplied through a Bank.
You cannot touch, or see, the intangible “label” which a Bank
leaves on any services or goods you may buy.
But all along the line between the producer and you, big
Banks like the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have a hand in
the financial transactions which enable you to satisfy your material
needs, and none has a greater than your own, the
dommonwealtb Sank of Australia.
POLITICAL
POINTS
With a liberal faith in the capacity of the
manufacturer to work marvels to order, the
N.S.W. Government has informed him that
the 44-hours w T eek will be established imme-
diately, and if the cutting down of the work-
ing time by one-twelfth reduces the output
without any corresponding reduction in ex-
penses he must ‘'make his adjustments” to
meet the case. It is to be hoped some real
pressure will be brought to bear on Bruce
and Earle Page to make an extra adjustment
of the tariff which will also meet the case,
else things may happen. This little table
is significant: —

The last Labor Government arrived in April
1920, and shrinkage of employment started at
once. The millennium was ordered, but it
didn’t arrive.
Though N.S.W. Premier Lang says the
matter of raising members’ salaries has not
vet been considered, it probably will be:
and when that happens it would be an in-
teresting innovation to make the increase
deferred pay, invested for the politician s
benefit in Government securities, protected
against his creditors, and reverting to him
on his final retirement or to his widow at
death Then his constituents couldn t bail
him up for more donations simply because
of his better circumstances, as they certainly
will if his screw is merely raised. Under
The Bulletin's plan? by the time better
circumstances materialised he wouldn t care
a continental for all the constituents ever
born.
The death of Jack Birt, eloquent speaker
and good fellow, has enabled Paddy Minahan,
though rejected by the Sydney electors, to
take his seat in the new N. S. Wales Leg.
Assembly as one of their representatives.
Also Alderman Mick Burke becomes the
senior member for Sydney. By an odd coin-
cidence, Royal Commissioner Lamb’s report
on a little matter in which Alderman Burke
was concerned was printed and distributed
just before the Fuller Government left office.
The salient points are: —
As alderman (he) receives no remuneration for his
services. At the time in question he was a com-
mission agent. His business was a small one. He
kept no books and he had no bank account, he had no
office and he carried on business from his home and
the Town Hall. On July 9, 1924, there was an
interview between Alderman Burke and Mr. Parnham,
manager of the Country Producers’ Selling Co I
find that Alderman Burke did offer to accept four
fifties. I am satisfied that Mr. Parnham received
from Anderman Burke a proposal which he had
either directly or indirectly invited.
Certainly a unique appreciation of a senior
member for Sydney.
One effect of Labor's win in N.S.W. has
been to close up the Liberal ranks in Vic-
toria. Treasurer Peacock, Allan’s offsidor,
managed to lure to a recent wongi' A. A.
Billson, Angus, Farthing and Everard, four
Independent Libs., as well as the true-blucs.
Illness kept Snowball from rolling up. Law-
son's plea for unity carried more weight than
Peacock's, as he had no vested interest in the

“M r. p. G. Stewart ex-Federal Minister for Public Works, paused from his efforts to wreck the

but tb e discussion was inconclusive. Nobody
had anything better to put forward than the
appointment of a commission on the Federal
pattern, but then the lion came into the path
—the number respectively of town and tsoun-
try constituencies. Efforts will be made by

Central Council when they sought to „et
Allan slated for not having taken a poll of
wheatgrowers to decide whether or not they
favored a compulsory wheat pool. Allan s
defence was (1) that two K.C.’s had advised
that a compulsory pool in one State would be
ineffective; (2) that there was no chance
of getting the Leg. Council to accept the
compulsory principle; and (3) that he had
offered the existing voluntary pool a charter
for five years, with a Government guarantee
for the same period of the market value of
wheat at the time of delivery. The substance
was preferred to the shadow, and Allan went
on his way rejoicing. Whether the taxpayer
will have any reason for rejoicing remains
to be seen. The next move of the win-tie-or-
wrangle group will be to make things un-
comfortable for Allan when the House meets
in a fortnight.
The present N.S.W. floods, which have con-
verted Windsor into an island and the flat
plain around it into an inland sea with a
depth of 20ft. in places, challenge the wisdom
of the Commonwealth Government in placing
an aerodome at Richmond well inside the
threatened area. A flying depot which is
liable to isolation and inundation every time
a storm-burst happens may prove a poor
asset in case of need. It may be, of course,
that the Defence Department contemplated
making it into a hydroplane establishment.
The Central Queensland Council has de-
cided to agitate for a Federal bonus, fixed
for a period of years, of lid. per lb. on
cotton. If it is not forthcoming there is no
saying what will happen. It was the same
with the State’s cattle business, when the
Commonwealth was invited to grant an ex-
port bonus to make up in part for the
amount which the beef-men lost through
having half a million per year added to their
rents, and it is the same with the State’s
much-aided sugar business now. It seems
a pity that Theodore’s country, after ten
years of the blessings of the new Labor
rule, can’t pay its own bonus for once in a
while. Political life in Australia, is degen-
erating into a hard struggle to cadge from
the common fund for local interests, and the
Commonwealth has almost given up the
attempt to honor its own obligations in its
efforts to buy temporary peace.
There are nearly a dozen candidates in
the field for the Hobart seat in the Speck’s
Peg. Council formerly filled by the late Chap-
man. They include Charlie Eady, lawyer
and one-time cricketer: .Tack Nettlefold,
estate-agent and formerly newspaper pro-
prietor ; Frank Bond, a former M.L.C., and
probably Tasmania’s wealthiest nabob ; and
lawyer Okines, legal partner of Attorney-
General Ogilvic. Under the plural-vote fran-
chise of the Propputy Chamber it is doubt-
ful if Okines (endorsed Labor candidate)
could, under ordinary circumstances, win the
seat. But with a Labor Government in
power anything may happen. Nobody gives
the Council a hope of regaining its lost
powers, and as its former supporters are
very unlikely to agree to its retention as a
mere ornament at an upkeep cost of £lO,OOO
a year, it is certainly doomed. In view
of this it is just possible that the electors
will decide to send in the Labor lawyer to
help fix up the last will and testament in
order. One never knows.
From the Gallery :
While it is agreed that Drake Brockman, the
retiring Westralian Senator, will be offered a job in
Pearce’s Northern Province if the enabling legisla-
tion goes through, the obliging young brig, has
something else in view. For health reasons Speaker
Watt is unlikely to accompany the Federal Parlia-
ment to Canberra; and if he decides not to stand next
year, Drake Brockman may get the Nationalist
nomination for Balaclava. Though a Sandgroper
by birth, he married a Victorian girl and is on
good terms with the heads of the Vic. National
Federation.
The Maoriland authorities considered they
had identified an unpleasant imported Com-
munist in one Lyons, who started holding up
ships in the orthodox Australian manner.
So the Attorney-General ordered him off the
premises without trial, just as they do in
England, and just as a publican does when
a drunk makes trouble in his bar. There
was a shriek of protest from Communist
quarters, of course; but did the Communist
quarters of Port Darwin bother about an order
of Court when they wanted to get the Aus-
tralian Government representatives off what
they regarded as their premises in 1020?
The statement made before the W.A- Dis-
abilities Commission that the people of the
Western State will be “difficult to restrain’’
if they are not recouped for some of the losses
they have suffered through Federation recalls
that Groperland has never submitted tamely
to interference with its rights. “When the
intention of the Imperial Government to put
a stop to transportation became known
locally,” says Dr. Battye in his “History of
Western Australia,” “the cry for compensa-
tion was immediately raised.” The Perth
Chamber of Commerce of that period led the
chorus of indignation, and solemnly placed its
opinion on record that “as we are to be de-
prived of that labor which should be avail-
able for roads, a grant of £250,000 from the
Imperial funds, to be paid annually in sums
of £25,000, should be asked for.” It does
not appear that any specific claim was ever
presented, but the historian relates that the
Secretary of State for the Colonies was inter-
viewed by some sturdy patriots “who re-
ceived no satisfaction beyond the assurance
that the question would be considered.”
A couple of lines lifted from the Leg.
Council electoral roll for Hobart, said to
be the freakiest roll in the Empire:—
Jones, Mrs., 118 Murray-street, home duties, house
and shop (occupier).
Jones, Lady, 229 Oampbeil-street, home duties, house
(occupier), New Town.
Apparently both the plain Mrs. and the
exalted Lady dispense with Christian names
when enrolling as free and enlightened elec-
tors.
The bright lights still beat all the efforts
of Railway-chief Clapp and the Country-
party politicians. From 1912 to 1923 in-
clusive Victoria’s population increased
284.000, only 31,000 of the lot being outside
Melbourne. During 1923 the State’s increase
was 35,000. but the country outside Mel-
bourne lost nearly 1000 inhabitants. Last
year was worse, for while Melbourne in-
creased by 32,850, and Geelong. Bendigo and
Ballarat by 1430, the rest of the State lost
2565.
The proposal of the Town Planning Com-
mission to run a tram-line through portion
of Melbourne’s Botanic Gardens has roused
vigorous protest. An electric tram-track is
to skirt each side of the central reserve in
Victoria-parade. But for a protecting sec-
tion inserted in an Act last year at the
instance of Laborite J. P. Jones (M.L.C.)
the rails would have, been laid down the
centre. It now requires the approval of both
State Houses, by resolution, to open a reserve
to the Tram Board.
The 44-hour week, which will arrive in
Queensland next month, is to be worked on
the Government railways in five shifts of
eight hours and one of four. When the matter
was discussed in the Arbitration Court, a
union representative proposed five shifts of
8 4-5 hours; the Brisbane goods-shed em-
ployees, he exp'-dned, would like the Satur-
day off. Perhaps he would have gone on to
suggest that the goods-shedders should be
provided with free race-books if an official
from the head office hadn’t muttered some-
thing about the public convenience. Then
Webb, J., said there would have to be 5£
shifts
Mellool, a polling-place in Sturt, registered
an unusual achievement at the N.S.W. elec-
tion. It cast 22 votes; all were rejected as
informal. Another humorous feature of the
Sturt contest was that Laborite Davidson’s
second preferences put Doe. the Nationalist,
in. Sturt doesn’t take Sydney politics very
seriously nowadays.

To smash CaraCtacus and give Boadicea beans,
To civilise and Christianise, with sword and spear
and flame. . .
Ah! but our dads were heathens blind till those old
Romans came.
They didn’t know what churches were, those poor
benighted blokes
Whose Druids hacked the mistletoe and danced around
the oaks.
Later, from Tyne to wooded Thames, from Dee to
silver Wye,
They worshipped gods with dreadful names like
Woden, Frigg and Ti.
They couldn’t even build n road, historians allow
Or p’r’haps they didn’t need one —till the Romans
showed them how,
And ranged them in construction gangs to excavate
a few ;
Showed them the way to Heav’n as well—and made
them take it, too.
I wonder if we’ve ever tried to pay the staggering
debt
Or whether anyone contends it’s liquidated yet.
Muse, brother, muse, whene’er you look upon a Dago
phiz,
Where your remote forefathers might have stayed
except for his.
They tore their meat like famished hounds, they
simply hogged their mead
By pails (I’d like a single pint just now, I would
indeed),
Till Roman generals came along with well-drilled
troops in galleys
And all the latest things in arms—and creeds—and
cooks —and valets.
Then glance not with disparagement upon the swarthy
man,
Who packs the peanuts in the bag and sells you the
banan’ ;
Though greasy be his linen now, a stately toga
flowed ’•
Adown his forebears’ limbs when yours were merely
garbed in woad. '
His ancestors washed banquets down with choice
Falernian wine
Two thousan 1 years ago when your progenitors and
mine
Were lapping from the brooks and munching acorns
with the swine.
And still Cesaro leaves his vine-clad slopes ’neath
turquoise skies.
But not, like Caesar went of old, with sword to civilise.
He seeks a job—Rome’s golden age is but a memory
dim.
The only trouble nowadays is civilising him.

“Pick”; The liveliness of old-time elec-
tions was not confined to the big cities (I».
11 /0/’25). When the two brewers, I ooth
and Tooliey, contested Monaro (N.S.W.) in
the ’seventies, barrels of free beer were rolled
out to the front of every pub on the table-
lands on polling-day. Memories still linger
in Monaro of that exhilarating occasion.
Incidentally, it was on the same day that
Pat Minalian put up a record for successful
marksmanship. After proving their quality
in divers riots and brawls, Tooliey s sup-
porters marched triumphantly through Bom-
bala with a banner on two poles, each sur-
mounted with a lantern. A battered oppo-
nent offered Pat a fiver to nothing that he

couldn’t break the lanterns as the procession
passed the pub-corner. Pat gathered some
road metal, and from the murkiness ot the
stableyard outod tin 1 lights with two sue-
cessive shots. Then lie fled, with the enem,\
in hot pursuit; there are old men in Bom
bala who believe that Tooliey’s men are -still
chasing Minalian.
“Past Grand Tiler”: The Melbourne
Trades Hall Council in a benevolent moment
decided that its officers should undertake the
distribution of unemployed relief. Over 'JO
per cent, of the applicants are genuine cases;
the other 10 per cent, are a tribe of noisy
thugs who are filling the officials’ lives with
bitterness. Some quaint impostures have
been tried. The Cold Storage Employees
Union provided four crates of frozen rabbits,
and an endeavor was made to see that the
food should go where it would be most appre-
ciated. But dozens of rabbit carcases were
subsequently found about the Trades Hall,

“TT K”: It was at the Woolpack Hotel
th „t the Mayor of Parramatta entertained
t c guests who came the other day to cele-
brate the opening of the new motor-’bus ser-
vice from Sydney- Nearly 70 years ago, on
September 20, 1855, Governor Brisbane and
his party sat down at the original inn of
that name to commemorate the format open-
ing of the first railway in Australia. Ass >
dated with the old Woolpack Hotel are
many happenings of historic interest. Built
in 1813. it occupied the nowaday Court
House site, directly opposite where its suc-
cessor stands, and had as its _ first host
Andrew Nash. It was beneath his roof that
tin' colony’s first properly-constituted Agri-
cultural Society was formed on January 30,
1903 At the rear of the old Woolpack was
also laid down the first bowling-green in Aus-
tralia. That was during Andrew 1 ayten s
reign as licensee in the late sixties.
“Wanchai”: The prominence given lately
to Canton recalls to me a day, five years ago,
when I was inspecting a Buddhist temple
there. A city merchant, a Cantonese, who
had “finished” at an English University,
acted as guide to our party, which included
an American. Stacked on an altar were
what appeared to be several huge bundles
of banknotes. These caught the commercial
eye of the Yank, who expressed the opinion
that the heathen Chinee must be an honest
sortaguy if all those dahlars could safely be
left lying around. “No countryman of
mine.” parried the guide in perfect English,
“would be likely to steal them. Further
questioning elicited the information that, the
notes were to be consumed as a sacrifice to
the Great .Toss. The citizen from the IJ.B.
was beginning an explosive protest against
such an outrage, when the Cantonese ex-
plained that the notes were counterfeit.
“But,” he whispered with a bland smile,
“.Toss doesn’t know that.”

“C Coral” : In many country towns it is
usual to hoist a flag at half-mast whenever
a well-known resident passes out, the local
pub supplying the staff. In a South Aus.
township the two hotels were on opposite
corners of the street, and there was gener-
ally a keen eye kept for “first to hoist. ’ But
the publicans were both unconscious humor-
ists. Their bunting supply allowed of the
Red Ensign or Jack going up for public
rejoicings, but it was felt that something 'less
vivid should be hung out for a death. So
from one staff there floated sombrely a green
flag with a rich gold harp in the centre,
the only other signal in the locker; while
across the street the wind revealed the folds
of the Blub Peter, which in nautical lan-
guage means “Am about to sail. And the
owner of the other flag seemed never to
tumble that his golden harp suggested that
he at any rate was sure where the departed
citizen had gone.

“Borom”: Touching qualifications for
hangmen’s jobs fB. 11/6/25), some years
ago I was privileged to inspect a shoal of
letters received from persons who regarded
themselves as eligible for a vacancy in one
of the States of the Commonwealth. There
were over a hundred of the applications, all
produced bv a paragraph in one of the dailies
to the effect that the Jack Ketch of the period
was about to retire. One applicant stated
that in his capacity of barber's assistant he
had made a special study of the neck. An-
other said that he had been interested in
capital punishment for years, and with
the aid of a dummy figure had carried
out many experiments. In Australia such
applications are never called for publicly;
some official of the Sheriff’s Department is
generally able to lay his hand on the right
man. When a new hangman had to be ob-

tained at short notice some years back a
sailor from a vessel then in port was secured,
possibly on the strength of his familiarity

the confidence felt in him.

“Hasen” : Operations of various kinds on
the “exposed” heart, far from being “directly
due to the war” (B. 11/0/’25). were per-
formed years before that particular unpleas-
antness, perhaps the oldest being paracentesis
or wide incision and drainage of the pericar-
dium to prevent purulent infection; also
many attempts, some of them successful, at
repair of penetrating wounds of the ventricles.
This latter class, of course, would include
bullet-wounds; still, a vicious stiletto can
make just as business-like a hole. As to Ex-
Dig.’s” “actually one instance in which a
medical officer opened the chest of a man”
in an effort to restore a collapsed anaesthe-
tised patient by “pulsing the heart,” I myself
was a minor actor in a precisely similar per-
formance at the Perth Public Hospital before
ever Brother Fritz earned the name of Hun.
Cardiac massage, either after removal of a
couple of costal cartilages or more indirectly
through the diaphragm, was a last-resort re-
suscitatory method recommended in the text-
books of pre-war student days. “Ex-Dig.
might have been nearer the mark if he’d said
that heart-operations had, perhaps, been more
successful since the war, which really was not
responsible for more than a fraction of the
things, good and bad, laid at its door.

“J.H.M.A.” : I recently watched an abor-
tive outbreak of fire in the old Sydney build-
ing in George-street North which has in-
scribed over its main entrance
ERECTED
IN THE YEAH 1812.
L. Macquarie, Esq.,
Governor.
and is at present occupied by Taxation
pirates and the chemical branch of the De-
partment of Agriculture. It seemed likely
that tlic solid four-square filock of a house,
erected over a century ago by F. H. Green-
way, would go up in smoko, but a combma-
tion of luck and good work by the fire-brigade
saved the situation and the taxation papers.
The valuable structure stands on historic
ground. Immediately opposite, No. 4 Police
Station occupies the site of Australia s first
hospital, where Sydney’s sick and injured
were more or less looked, after for 25. years
until the institution in Macquarie-street,
whose northern and southern wings survive
in the buildings occupied by the State Parlia-
ment and the Royal Mint, was opened m
1816. In rear of it, facing Sydney Cove,
are the old Commissariat Stores of consider-
ably earlier date, on whose beautifully
wrought individual blocks of sandstone are
still discernible the marks and ciphers of the
convict stonemasons who shaped them long
ago. Close by was the King’s Wharf, and
about this part of George-street clustered the
main business centre of the little town that
Phillip planned and Macquarie regenerated.
To the writer the typical Macquarie build-
ing nearly destroyed the other day has a
peculiar interest as the scene of the labors
of one of the characters who figure in many
stories of his printed in The Bulletin dur-
ing the last decade —Mr. Acting-Deputy-
Assistant-Commissary-General Pilkington.
“Machete”: As one who lias been much
exposed to Yorkshire hospitality, I fancy
there is a slight error in the statement (I>.
11/6/’25) that a visitor to the horse-dealing
county was expected to begin his dinner with
plum-pudding. More likely it was plum-
porridge, a heavy broth studded with raisins
—always “plums” in Yorkshire. Still, the
real Yorksliireman of the West and North
ridings has his peculiar fancies in food, and
drink also. No one makes a collar of brawn
quite so well as a Yorkshire housewife, and
no one bred or broken in in the big county
would think of eating it without the original
“Yorkshire relish”—sugar, mustard and vin-
egar mixed to a paste. The writer never
realised that human beings could drink hot
gin and water as a morning draught and live
to a green old age until he was introduced

to West Riding farm-houses. And then-
medicines were just as forthright. 1 -here
is a splendid old Yorkshire remedy for a cold

feeling, or anything else: One quart of gin,
one of cream, one of honey, and enough oat-
meal to “thick it oop.” Take as much of it
as often as you feel inclined.

to the manager, with whom he was on mti-

America within a few hours, and the em-
bezzler begged his superior to defer reporting
the deficit until he was on the water. The
manager listened sympathetically, and four
hours after sailing-time wired the head office
to the effect that Mr Blank had not re-
ported for duty, and examination of the cash
disclosed a shortage. The teller got clear
away, fluked a lucrative position in Uncle
Sam’s country, and after several years’ resi-
dence there returned to Australia with the
idea of refunding the £5OO. Interviewing the
general manager straight away he was amazed
to learn that the deficit amounted to £4OOO.
The sympathetic manager had got away with

“Miro”: Several public departments in
M.L. have decided that notices are best
couched in plain language. Thus “Please do
not expectorate” has been changed to “Don’t
spit,” “No admittance except on business” to
“Keep out,” and “Please enter without
knocking” to “Walk in.” But it remained for
a Government Department to issue rules for
motorists, starting off with the safety ex-
hortation. “Always regard the other driver
as a blithering idiot.” If the Courts want
to fall into line they should post over tin-
witness-boxes “Don’t lie,” while the churches
can display prominently “No thruppences;
make it sixpence,” and the matined pro-
grammes “All hats off.” There’s quite a lot
in this plain speaking to the public.

“Bouragi”: A reference to legal officials in
the early days of N. S. Wales (B. 11/6/’25)
is a reminder of old-time British New Guinea
methods. A Treasurer of the old days had
graduated in finance at the steering oar of a
Queensland Customs whaleboat. Yet, per-
haps because he was born in ►Scotland, lie had
a long and creditable run. B.N.G.’s first
medical officer outside Dr. Macgregor— -who
scorned medical work save when it was forced
upon him—came along as a steward on the
old Merrie England. If lie had any academic
qualifications no one ever heard of them, but
he did years of good work as a practitioner
in malaria and other tropical diseases, and
was a useful surgeon. Another man, an ex-
medical student from London, was given a
special and unpleasant medical job in an
isolated part of the Territory, and made a
striking success of it. He was ostensibly an
assistant resident magistrate, but his work
was almost entirely the treatment of venereal
disease.

“X.D.” : The criminal is as proud of his
press-cuttings as an actor; and it was a
bit of print regarding a robbery which in-
cluded some bottles of Canadian whisky plus
an empty bottle
bearing the same
brand, both found
in the suspect’s
possession, that
supplied the neces-
sary evidence
against a Melbourne
crook quite re-
cently. Apropos, a
member of the Vic.
force secured as his
personal prize the
press-cutting book
of an even more
noted Melbourne
criminal when the
owner went up for
his last stretch. The
book contained com-
plete notices of sev-
eral robberies with
some of which the
prisoner had not
previously been con-
nected with in the
official mind. Also
there were reports
of his appearances
in court. Judicial
thunders such as
“the most tricky
and abandoned
criminal known to
Melbourne” were
proudly underlined
in ink, just as the
actor often under-
scores personal re-
ferences in his
notices. But the
policeman had to
give up his prize
when the outlaw
was released from
prison; he threat-
ened to make such
a fuss about the disappearance of his bundle

“Two Seas” with another felo de sc: —
I am inclined to agree with “Hasen” (B. 4/6/’25)
that the man who talks suicide seldom provides a
job for the coroner. 04d Bill the Blower, well
known along the Murray in the early ’nineties, divided
his time between burrs and booze. As his occupa-
tion provided him with only 15 bob a week, he
didn’t go on a burst very often, but when he did we
had an anxious time until he took to the hoe again.
All firearms and knives had to be carefully hidden
away during the “re-
covery” period, but
some careless hand
would sometimes leave
the catching-rope at
the yards, and several
times it was only
Bill’s yell of “Good-
bye all !” that sent a
rescue party hotfoot
to the scene just in
time to save him from
jumping off the top of
the gallows with a
noose around his neck.
Other nights we would
be awakened by the
familiar farewell
yelled from the bank
of the river, and all
hands would rush down
to haul the rash
ancient home, kicking
and swearing, and im-
ploring us to let him
“finish the job.” We
usually spent most of
the night extracting
grass-seed and thorns
from our bare feet
after putting Bill back
in his bunk. One night
he refused to get into
his pew, so we left him
sitting at the table
that ran the whole
length of the hut,
staring at the slush
lamp. Presently Sailor
Jack, who h«d never
before shown mu c h
sympathy for old Bill,
slipped from his bunk
and put a heavy navy
revolver on the table
in front of the dejected
burr-cutter. “Here’s
your chance to euchre
those interfering buz-
zards,” said Jack. “See”
—he jerked the cart-
ridges out of the gun
and reloaded it. “Now
step outside quietly and you’ll be all set. But
don’t give ’em the fare-ye-well. I’ll do that
for you afterwards.” But Bill didn’t thank him
for his thoughtfulness. All he said was: “Take
that thing away, you ’ard-’earted bloody-minded
pirate!” Then he turned in. We had no more
trouble with him after that.
* * * *
“Ake, Ake”: There is no question about
the potency of M.L. beer; even seasoned
ships’ firemen have been heard to declare
that “it’s a bit too ’eavy after • a long
voyage.” When the war started a force
was sent from the Shivery Isles to occupy
German Samoa, and for three months it
tried vainly to drown its thirst in lager.
Then a shipment of the national beverage
arrived. The troops fell on it with such
earnestness that within a couple of hours
something very like a riot was in progress.
One band of revellers, taking charge of the
military railway, headed for the bush. It
was Christmas time, and for two days the
authorities strove to restore order and
sobriety. But they needn’t have worried.
The climate was the more effective agent.
No morning after the night before has ever
been quite so appalling as the one experi-
enced on this occasion by most of the topers.
Nevertheless, for the remainder of the occu-
pation Dominion beer was rigidly a pro-
hibited immigrant.
“Morehead” : He followed various callings
for a crust, and spent frequent and long inter-
vals away from his home in Sydney. On re-
turning from his last spell away, which lasted
12 months, mostly spent in North Queens-
land, he was staggered to find that his wife
had just made an addition to the population.
With natural indignation he left the house
and sought the consolation of an old cobber
at the nearest pub. “Yairs,” he said, as he
wiped the remains of his fourth pint from
out of his straggling moustache, “it’s blanky
hot.” “Of course you’ll get yer own back
on her,” urged his friend. “Get my own
back!” roared the wronged one. “Too blanky
tme I will. I’ll collar every flamin’ penny
of her baby bonus.”'
* * * . . *
“Ams” : A correspondent, writing to a Mel-
bourne paper about a recent effort to burgle
his shop, puts it this way : “On Friday morn-
ing thieves had £l5O worth packed up when
they were disturbed. This is the twelfth
attempt since 1919. Why not give somebody
else a burl? I appeal to their sense of fair
play, and beg them to give me a rest.” Which
is probably a better way of putting it than
that of a friend of mine, who some years ago
found his week-end bungalow thoroughly ran-
sacked. There was nothing of great value in
the furnishings that had disappeared, but un-
friend was peevish about it, and, suspecting
certain neighbors, had a paragraph printed in
a paper with a local circulation. In this, with
heavy sarcasm, he announced his surprise
that two small rain-water tanks in the back
hadn’t gone, too, and his grief that the visitors

THE FLAPPER : “Everyone says your husband’s notes are liquid.”
THE TENOR’S WIFE : “They are As soon as I lay hands on them

should have missed them. Evidently he didn’t
appreciate the exact and literal quality of the
native mind. On his next visit the tanks had
gone.

“X.N.0.” : Narrow escapes? I was on
board H.M. battleship Vanguard one after-
noon at Scapa Flow discussing a gunnery
question. As I was leaving for my own ship
I asked my host if he were going to a
concert to be given on board the Royal Oak
that night. He said he was not, but after-
wards apparently changed his mind and
went, in company with some 40 other officers
ot the Vanguard, many of whom probably
made up their minds at the last moment.
While they were away the ship mysteriously
blew up and the only survivor of about a
thousand officers and men who were on board
was, when I last heard, spending his days
in a lunatic asylum. The explosion took
place at 11.40 p.m., about 15 minutes before
the concert-goers were due back.

From a medical man in a district where
Wun Lung flourishes: —
If “Feng-Shui” (B. 21/5/’25) knew more of the
methods of Chinese herbalists, he would approve of
them less. If he thinks it is a laudable thing to
hold out the hope of cure in cases of cancer and
consumption that surgeons and physicians declare
to be beyond operation and incurable, and to take
the last penny from dying and impoverished wretches,
driven by their extremity to consult these quacks, then
I do not share his admiration. Few medical men
are spared the experience of seeing patients with
horrible cancers in the neck and elsewhere who,
having refused operation by surgeons, have, lured by
the glowing advertisements and reports of these
quacks, paid their last penny for the cure that never
eventuated. A plaster is generally the treatment,
and there is nothing Chinese about it. Arsenic is
tne basis of nine out of ten cancer “cures.” The
pain from this treatment is intense. One man.
describing the death of his friend under one ot
these quacks, said: “Once the treatment was started
no atom of agony or anguish that the mind of a
fiend could conceive was spared my friend before
death released him.” To those who know, “Feng-
Shui’s” appendicitis yarn cuts little ice. Man)
cases of appendicitis, especially first attacks, are
relieved by medicinal treatment, and often recover
without any doctoring at all; but the real cur-'
is only affected by surgery. Medical treatment does
not remove the cause of the disease, whereas surgery
does, and most patients who die of the disease give
a history of previous attacks.
THE JOYS OF JARABUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Jarabub oasis lies on the Tripolitan-
Egyptian border. In 1921 the late Lord Milner
negotiated with Signor Scialoja, the Italian Foreign
Minister, the cession of this oasis to Italy.”
’Mid Tripoli’s candescent sands
The Jarabub oasis stands.
A Naboth’s vineyard, sweetly shy
Beneath the Dago’s greedy eye:
Though what the deuce he wants with it
Has puzzled folk of keener wit,
Who wonder why his swarthy crew
Does not make tracks for far N.Q.,
Since there’s no sugar-cane to cut,
But life runs in a pious rut.
A Moslem saint has there his den,
And, ringed about by holy men,
In peace and sanctity, sans souci,
He takes fat tithes from his Senussi,
Who all consider him the Hub
Of Holiness, in Jarabub.
In that lone spot, by Allah blest,
Each day’s exactly like the rest.
Man lingers through a leisured life
Unfretted by industrial strife,
For all the desert’s wide expansion
Harbors no Walsh or J. Johanson.
Imported leaders lay no trammels
Upon those desert craft, the camels,
And drowsy drivers keep no track
Of cargo’s color, white or black ;
While ne’er a Court of Arbitration
Provokes derisive cachinnation.
And there no politicians squeal,
Or aldermen break through and steal,
Though the hyena and his cub
Range, ravening, round Jarabub.
In such a haven one might well
The last beads of a lifetime tell,
A-drcam in contemplative calm
Beneath a fruited, rustling pa,lm,
Leading a life of luscious stodge
With ne’er a creditor to dodge,
And nothing that one likes forbidden ;
In peace at last from Mr. Whiddon.
Forgotten, disappointment’s smart,
The good wife’s temper, hot and tart;
The pony tipster’s premonitions,
And all the latest late editions;
E’en publishers one might forgive,
And wish sub-editors to live,
While, p’rhaps, a tender, tiny tear
Might fall for half-forgotten beer;
And that reminds me ; there’s the rub.
There is no semblance of a pub—
Not anywhere—in Jarabub.

Since April 1 the new capital of £1,125,000
has flowed in and the whole of the author-
ised £6,154,088 is now subscribed. This
latest expansion lifts the B.N.Z. to pre-
mier place among Australasian banks so
far as issued capital is concerned, although
the Bank of N. S. Wales lias a larger volume
of banking business. The recent increase
was due not to ordinary necessities, but to
meet a position created by the conclusion of
the prolonged moratorium. A flood of appli-
cations by farmers for long-term loans moved
the Board to suggest the issue of the balance
of the Bank’s authorised capital, the amount
to he lent to the Government for the use
of the Advances to Settlers’ Department.
This was sound enough banking, though it
would not have been sound for the Bank
itself to have made the large number of long-
dated advances. The loan is in the form
of inscribed stock, interest 5J p.e., currency
10 years. Although the new capital was not
due until April 1, at the close of the accounts
£554,465 had already been lodged. Of the
new issue one-third went to the Government
in the shape of “B” prefs. as specified by
the Bank of N.Z. Act 1920. The remaining
750,000 were offered to holders of ordinaries
at par. With shares around 565. (575. 9d.
was the market price in Auckland early this
month), shareholders were on a very rich
thing. But the Board issued a warning
against anticipation of further plums: and
in that connection it has to be remembered
that this last big lot of capital will go on
earning only 5J p.e. gross for the next 10
years at least.
Net profits climbed almost to the amazing
figure of 1921 —the peak year of the post-
war boom —although gross income was not
so great:—

' *Less provision for contingencies.
Thus the B.N.Z. paid out over a million
pounds in taxes for 1921 and 1922, where-
as for the last two years, on aggregate pro-
fits £45,819 greater, taxes were a quarter-
million less. Prom the fact that inner re-
serves amounting to £184,465 were disclosed
in 1924 it may be accepted that the man-
agement was thoroughly satisfied with the
quality of its risks and had provided against
contingencies. Simultaneously it decided
that, as premises, etc., were in the books at
“very much less than actual value,” there
was no necessity to write down. (Two years
ago they were in the books at “nearly three-
quarters of a million less, than the land-tax
valuation.”) Nor was any depreciation done
last year. This would suggest undue optimism
were it not that the Board has been foremost
in exposing the artificially-high valuation of
land in the Dominion —both rural and urban
• —and the dhnger contained in it. It is un-
likely that the Board has ignored its own
warnings. The return to the gold basis has
eased things tremendously. Handling perhaps
75 p.e. of the exchange business for the
Dominion, the management found itself ham-
pered by excessive accumulations in London.
In October last, for instance, it had in
London resources to the amount of 91 mil-
lions —5 millions or so more than normal
requirements—earning only half what they
could have earned in M.L.
Possibility of State purchase died (or at
least fell into a condition of coma) when
louseph Ward went out. in 1919. The scheme
is not very attractive, since the purchase of
the Bank’s assets would involve a large sum,
and the State is already the largest share-
holder. llow Dick Seddon came to the
rescue of the Bank in the ’nineties (which
accounts for the State’s participation) is
ancient history. The Government’s holding
now amounts to £500,000 “A” prefs. and
£1,375,000 “B” prefs., and, as it shared
in the 1921 capitalisation, its present-day
“B” div. is worth 20 p.c. Profits in excess
of £356,250 (1920 divs.) go one-third to
“B” shares and two-thirds to ordinaries.
Thus the Government collects a big div. out
of the bank plus the sum taken in taxation.

Excluding new share money received just
prior to the close of the accounts, the bank
was holding on March 31 £4 13s. 4d. of out-
side money for eacli £1 of its own funds.
That is very strong; stronger, indeed, than
is necessary. More than two-thirds of the
liabilities were represented by liquid assets,
so there, too, was exceptional strength. The
woollen industry in M.L. is feeling the effects
of external competition, and, with rare ex-
ceptions, the meat-freezing cos. are having
a hard time. But wool has proved no less
a wonderful wealth-winner for the Dominion
than for Australia, and generally the outlook
is bright. But the Dominion depends on
produce for its wealth, and while export sur-
pluses are assisting, the failure of many sec-
tions of industry and most of the farming
community to provide for the future easts
a heavy responsibility on the banks. It
depends on their measurement of the possi-
bilities as to how the country emerges when
trouble comes. The 1921 slump was one
test. Judged on that the future Can be
viewed with confidence by depositors and
shareholders.

There was no pause in the onward march.
Certainly disclosed net profits were only
£4OOO greater; but a clod of suspicion is cast
at the figures because, of an increase of
£64,738 in gross profits from manufacturing,
exes, (including taxes and insurance) took
£60,615. Not that this Column growls at
the co. for putting a bit up its sleeve, for it
has to meet many unforeseen contingencies
in pioneering some branches of glass-making,
and to face competition from the world’s best
in countries where mention of the 44-hour
week is next door to treason. Even the co.’s
long-proposed venture into sheet-glass manu-
facture is still in the air, because of the vast
difference between Australian and (say)
Belgian industrial conditions. Last year, to
provide capital for the purpose, 154,743
ordinaries were issued, which accounted for
the increase of £104.294 in capital. But the
Board intends to hold off unless the Federal
Government claps a duty of 60 p.c. ad
valorem. on the low-wage foreign article.
Granted adequate Protection the co. is in a
position to make a prompt start, for it pos-
sesses the Australian rights of one of the
latest processes, and the question of technical
experts was arranged by W. J. Smith on his
last visit to Europe. Plant for the manufe"-
ture of lamp glass and other flint ware had
already been laid down in Sydney. The
broad foundations of the co.’s business still,
however, are bottles. Australian Glass con-
trols the bulk of the bottle-making business
of the Commonwealth. The old co. was
formed in 1915. It combined Melbourne
Glass Bottle Works and two old Sydney
concerns, Vance and Ross and Waterloo
Glass, and established works in Queensland,
S. Aus. and Tas. In 1922 came amalgama-
tion with Zetland Glass, Sydney, a formid-
able rival founded by W. J. Smith, who had
withdrawn from Australian Glass after
having organised it. Most of the principal
bottle users were interested, and the big co.
started off with enormous contracts which
insured its position and its profits for years
ahead. Subsequent results have confirmed
the early expectations.
Of last year’s disclosed profits less than
two-thirds were distributed. The balance ex-
panded reserves to £139,168, which means
that the co. has by the end of its third year
accumulated profits £24,668 in excess of the
substantial goodwill item, which still figures
at £114,500. The position was very strong:—•

Book debts 127,901 134,113
Cash, investments, etc. . . 18,816 88,642
The effect of the new capital is visible in the
disappearance of the overdrafts (£40,138)
and in the movements of assets. While glass-
making machinery is subject to great depre-
ciation, a heavy hand appears to have used
the pencil last year: over £12,000 went off
buildings and £24,359 off plant, despite new
purchases. Naturally, therefore, the liquid
position improved materially; £57,902 was
placed on deposit and a further £22,391 in
Commonwealth stock. The co. has plenty
of money handy when the time comes to pur-
chase plant for sheet-glass making. Stocks
increased £64,336 and book debts by £6212,
which, with the other increases, tells of a
remarkably active year. Sundry debts
of £41,472 were represented by liquids
amounting to £222,755 apart from stocks.
Each £1 pref. share is secured by £6 3s. sd.
of net tangible assets. Little wonder that,
with such strong protection, the 9 p.c. prefs.
are popular on the market, and that when
sellers are to be found the quote is over 31s.

There is_ wisdom in that S p.c. div. Last
half-year’s profits would have permitted of
a 20 p.c. on ordinaries without straining
things, but the Board sent £26,234 to re-
serves. It would be a foolish shareholder
who would object to that policy. As matters
stand, G. and G. has won confidence through
its conservative treatment of profits, and
because of it the market is likely to look
kindly on the. appeal for £lOO,OOO of new
capital which is to be made shortly. Indeed,
a conservative line was more than politic, it
was essential, for the co. is burdened sub-
stantially with goodwill—£llB,o74 of it—and
is heavily dependent on outside funds. A
further disadvantage is that only a small
amount of the outside funds has been tied
to the business: overdrafts on Sept. 30,
1923, were over 10 times greater than the
mortgages, although at latest balance they
had been reduced to £184,149 compared with
£28,500 of mortgages. Of course the debt
has always been well covered, as these figures
show:—

The balance-sheet movements of the past
six months were unimportant.
The lease of the Brisbane premises lias
nearly expired, and a start will shortly
be made with the erection of a new ware-
house. This means an addition to the co.’s
freeholds, which already are heavy at
£120,189; and present building costs are not
light. Inasmuch as most of the co.’s space
is required for warehouse purposes, some-
thing less than freeholds near the heart of
each capital might meet requirements. Free-
holds are in the books at cost and there is
a reserve in that. Over £40,000 has been
sent to reserves in the past year, and all but
£25,343 of capital is now represented by tan-
gibles. There will be no difficulty in utilising
the new capital. Some will go towards the
Brisbane building, and the robust bank over-
drafts call for reduction. On Mar. 31 there
was £658,451 of more or less liquid assets to
represent £307,234 of floating debt, and that
wa.j apart from premises and fixtures. After
appropriations there were tangibles equal to
almost £4 15s. for each pref. share, or 19s.
for each £1 of paid capital. The co. in its
present form dates back to 1919. It has
had to organise an extensive business, and
recent increasing returns strongly suggest
that it has made a success of the job.

With a surplus £16,591 in excess of the sum
necessary to protect unexpired risks, the
Board, which consists chiefly of the directors
and executive of the Queensland Insurance
Co., relaxed to the extent of a 6 p.c. div.
Interest earnings (£6824) alone were more
than sufficient to cover the appropriation,
the year’s underwriting profits going to
strengthen the co.’s foundations. For a mere
four-year-old this is a rare achievement. The
co. could, in fact, have paid a 5 p.c div. in
its second year; but, instead, reserves were
built up and the position consolidated. And
yet the B. and T., despite its fortune
in the matter of selected business and
good management and the great value of its
connection with tin; Queensland Insurance
Co., did not wholly escape the unhappy ex-
periences of other underwriters over the past
three years :

Capital last year expanded by £1750, a further
3500 shares having been issued. Total funds
now amount to £129.930, well in excess of
what is usually considered adequate security,
and there is, in addition, the uncalled capital
of £89,350. During the year a branch was
opened at Montreal, Canada. The Montreal
Trust (an associate co. of the Royal Bank
of Canada) is one of the chief shareholders.
An agency was also established at Cairo,
and the inter-State Boards were strengthened.
Altogether the co.’s connections are so influ-
ential that it is worth watching.

equal to the larger task they had to do,
and reserves were assisted with £942. The
fact that capital was doubled in 1923 and
again last year speaks plainly enough of
expanding business ; although the volume of
trusts is not stated, the directors reported
satisfactory progress last year, and a record
number of notifications. Figures continue
to climb:—
Commissions. Interest. Expenses.
1917 .. £1096 £203 £687
1918 .. 1963 319 1278
1919 .. 2225 345 1558

1925 .. 6638 1681 5086
Interest on investments (shareholders’ funds
on March 31 totalled £31.219) amounted
to £1683, so that only £1553 of the profit
came from the trustee business; and that
looks pretty small, which is another
way of saying that expenses are not
light. The co.’s assets are mostly in public

There is trouble in the Joe Gardiner camp.
Of the 80,000 shares 10,000 are to be or have
been sold to Fays, Ltd., another Sydney boot-
retailing co., and the remaining 70,000 are
to be converted into 10 p.c. prefs.—if the
shareholders agree. The feature that looks
very bad is that the 10,000 ordinaries are
to control the show. Actually this is part
of the price shareholders pay for becoming
interested in what, after all, is very largely
a one-man show. Joe Gardiner has been
the overwhelming influence in the co.: a
man of enormous energy, his hand has been
everywhere. Lately he has had much domes-
tic trouble, and probably now wants to get
out. The question that faced the Board
/there are two other directors—a dentist and
a sharebroker) was how to ensure the carry-
ing on of the business. The scheme sub-
mitted is the answer. It isn’t a good
scheme: the question is whether in the cir-
cumstances anybody else could produce a
better.
# # * *
Monte Carlo Bank Co. (W.A.), since
abandoning its option on the cut-out patch
at Cue, has been seeking its fortune at Fields
Find. The manager now reports that he
is confident of “big possibilities,” and the
secretary states that a crushing will be put
through at the earliest possible moment. But
the market remains lifeless.
* * # *
Associated Northern (W.A.) is reported to
bo nibbling at the Mopoke, Ora Banda. There
is a large low-grade formation on the pro-
perty which would probably pay if worked
on a big scale. Years ago the co. acquired a
mine in this locality, and while values were
good and mill supplies could be picked it
made a little money; but deeper development,
lower-grade ore and higher costs soon mopped
up the surplus and made profitable mining
impossible. Some time ago the directors an-
nounced that as nothing worth having was
offering in Westralia, it was proposed to
try North-West Ontario, Canada. From all
accounts nothing suitable was found there.
Westralia reports another spectacular gold
find, 40 miles along the Trans, line, beyond
Randell’s. Rich stuff obtained on and near
the surface has been exhibited in Kalgoorlie,
and block-holders want high prices for what
remains. Some years ago a find. 37 miles
along the line, was unwarrantably boomed,
and about six months ago another discovery
a few miles away was similarly boosted. Both
are now practically deserted.
Manxman, near Bullfinch (W.A.), is now
the Mecca of various indigent Adelaide cos.
and option-seekers. Several have acquired
interests or are negotiating for some on
blocks that are reckoned to have a chance
of getting a bit of the Radio reef. Mean-
while a flutter in the shares-of the co. which
has taken the Radio on approval, and those
of the Hansel Mundy and Telfer North, which
hold options on adjoining blocks, is proceed-
ing. Several well-known mining men have
reported on the Radio in the past and voiced
the general opinion that, while it is valuable,
the price asked is too stiff. But in order
to have a gamble and make money it is
not necessary for the controllers of an option
co. to complete the deal. The game is to get
out while the public is getting in.
* * * *
Bullfinch Co. (W.A.) is gradually putting
the old workings of its Gladsome option at
Comet Vale in order. - and is now considering
the advisableness of shifting the plant on
the old mine at Bullfinch holus bolus to its
new address. The co.’s nominal capital is
now £375.000 in 700,000 ss. shares. Of this
number 476.157 are fully paid, 77.723 con-
tributing and 146,120 in reserve. Years ago
the Gladsome was mined for a few hundred
feet in depth, and between £200,000 and
£300,000 worth of gold extracted. Then it
was drowned by a flood from the adjoining
Sand Queen. It was this record of pro-
duction that induced the Bullfinch to take
an option and the State Government to agree
to a loan on a £l-for-£l basis up to £4OOO.
It took more than calls to keep New Langi
Logan (Vic.) going during the last six
months’ campaign. Gold gave £2641 and
calls £6376, leaving the bank to provide
£3BOO. The little debit at working account
accordingly moved from £205,813 to £214,473,
which represents the best part of the
£252,000 now standing at the bottom of the
balance-sheet. Most people would have
thrown in the towel a decade ago. Not so
Alex. Peacock or Jim Mackay. “Important”
development work —is it ever anything else
in a deep-lead show, especially when on the
call list? —has been done. It gives 400 ft. by
200 ft. of dry ground round No. 5 rise to pick
into while the main under-level is being
jogged along down the gutter. As 318
fathoms sent to the machines gave 7550 z., or
an average of 2oz. 7dwt., Peacock boldly
avows that, if men could be got, the values
would be highly payable. Seeing that it is
not so long since deep-lead mines paid divs.
on 15dwt. ground, the retort is that if New
Langi can’t get along under 2oz. stuff, which
won’t be averaged at the Langi, the time has
come for even Alex. Peacock to put up shut-
ters and try another gutter —say, the Madame
Hopkins or the Ascot Deep or any other of
the neglected giants. To get men under-
ground someone has thought out a plan
whereby the good miner can earn double
wages provided he will put elbow-grease into
the job. But it is as hard to get experienced
alluvial miners as to screw divs. out of the
Langi gutter. Most of them are dead, on
the land, or working in sewerage gangs where
the going is easy, the mud a plaything, the
union delegate a force, and the pony track
within walking distance.

The resurrection of the oil-shale industry
of Australia is likely to he delayed if many
balance-sheets are issued like that of the
Southern Cross Motor Fuels Co., which is
operating near Latrobe (Tas.). At the last
balance, on 925 shares of £5O each issued
prior to June, 1924, £3782 was unpaid.
The directors now propose to reconstruct
the co. as one of £74,400 in 1240 shares of
£OO each. Present shareholders will be given
a £6O share for the present £5O scrip and
be liable for £lO. This scheme is expected
to supply £9250. After squaring up and
cleaning the slate, there ought to be £7220
of working capital left. This is expected to
complete the plant by December next and
allow of 20,000 tons of oil shale being mined
during 1926.
•* * * #
Good progress is being made with the Mt.
Isa P ( rop. No. 2 bore, and already the drill
has been in the Black Star lode for some
distance. Assay values are well up to No. 1
bore values. There is no mineralogical
change. It will take about 250 ft. to go
through the lode on the assumption of a true
thickness of 80ft., and it will be probably
between 550 ft. and 600 ft. vertically before
the footwall is penetrated, as the dip has
steepened. There is little to be gained in
testing below 600 ft., in view of the enormous
tonnages already indicated above that level,
and also considering what little work has
yet been done on the richer Rio Grande and
Crystal. W. H. Corbould is very keen on
sinking a straight shaft opposite Star No.
10 shaft and crosscutting through the sul-
phides at. 300 ft., but No. 2 has been stopped
at 259 ft.
The “Wild Cat” has frequently advocated
giving the Great Northern tin-mine at Her-
berton (N.Q.) a more pushful scheme of
development, as the prospects fully warranted
it. It is pleasing to note that the new shoot
unearthed at the 300 ft. level is locally con-
sidered one of the most important recent
developments on the field. It has been
driven on 25ft. and is averaging Bft. wide.
A crushing of 75 tons returned 8 tons con-
centrates valued at £1350.
The new lead discovery in the Proserpine
district (N.Q.) by John Godkin looks fairly
promising. The mineralised outcrop is about
30ft. wide, with veins and lenses of high-
grade ore. No. 1 shaft, down 80ft., is show-
ing 7ft. of ore which assays 43 p.c. zinc.
30 p.c. lead and 16oz. silver. In No. 2
shaft, values are 64 p.c. lead and ISoz. silver
for a width of 2ft. at 45ft. down. No. 3
shaft, 50ft., is in formation carrying splashes
of lead and zinc. Values have been very in
and out down the shafts, and a lot more work
will have to be done before any opinion can
be relied ,on as to the value of the discovery.
At present it is just a question of whether
the individual ore shoots are plentiful enough
or big enough to make the whole thing pay-
able.
The newly-resuscitated Stanhills tin field
(N.Q.) is attracting considerable attention
now. Fifteen leases have been taken up in
the past few weeks, as well as a number of
prospecting claims. The prospects on the
Comet and Mauretania are responsible for
the activity. The erection of a 10-liead
stamper is well on to completion, and appear-
ances are that, with a few months’ develop-
ment, there will be no lack of high-grade
battery feed fo? a couple of years ahead. At
present the Mauretania looks like being one
of the star tin-mines in the North: from a
small lode at the surface it has opened out
to a width of Bft. at 90ft. bulking about
6 or 7 p.c. metallic tin. On the field
there are now four shafts between 56ft. and
100 ft. deep, and all are on payable ore. The
Minister for Mines has just visited the field
and is much impressed with the prospects
which took this Column’s eye a few months
ago.
* * * *
Zinc Corporation, which owns the mine
next to Broken Hill South, showed a profit
of £375,295 for the year ended Dec. 31,
according to a cabled summary. Ordinaries
get 50 p.c. and prefs. 45 p.c.; £lOO,OOO is
the addition to mine development account
and £20,000 to reserves, leaving £13,168 sent
to next accounts.
Ore breaking in the fire-harassed Central
Broken Hill will be resumed any day now.
A start will be made at the 500 ft. and 600 ft.
levels. W. E. Gardner says it will be on a
small scale at first, but more parties are to
be put on as stopes become available. Mining
will be difficult until the stopes are improved.
And miners sufficiently experienced to tackle
the difficult work may be hard to find.
Bribbaree (N.S.W.) scrip is selling at
13d., and the fortnightly amalgam justifies
the price, being only 71oz. from 90 tons of
quartz—about 7dwt. stuff when retorted.
Manager Williams gives evidence of 12in.
of poor ore at No. 3 s.-e. level, 4in. of patchy
ore of medium grade over No. 2 s.-e. level,
with 6in. to 24in. of “poor ore” in the level
and stopes at No. 1 n.-w. Cyanide vats will
improve the outlook a little, but date of
their activity is not given.
* * * *
Peak Mines, Cobar (N.S.W.), have got
the lode again in the winze below the 226 ft.
level. The winze is now 28ft. below the
rails, and the slide has thrown the ore to
the west, where it is still going in. The
south end is low grade, but in the north end
it assays 430 z. silver and 17Jdwt. gold over
48in. Over half the width assay values are
given as 140 oz. silver and 21|dwt. gold.
Banjoemas is a Javanese oil venture spon-
sored by Hal Sheppard and a couple of Mel-
bourne merchants. Vendors are the Bruix
Plantation Concessions, whose secretary, G.
S. Anderson, went over the area in 1922.
Then seven seepages—sacred number—were
shown to him, from one of which he brought
the invariable strong samples. These J. ('.
Watson classes as paraffin-base crude petro-
leums, mobile and therefore easy work for
the pipe-line. W. R. J. Henderson, a geolo-
gist, gives a word-picture of folds and tex-
tures, of marls and horizons as a setting
for the recommendation that indications fully
warrant a testing of the field by two shallow
and one medium-deep bores. Henderson, a
recommendation of Cunningham Craig, has
been working on the spot for the Biting Con-
cessions next door, so he should have its geo-
logy at his fingertips. The little block which
Banjoemas has to prospect is of 117,861 acres.
If oil be struck, then it has to be whittled
down to 1250 acres, the gentle Dutchman no
doubt pouching surrounding areas. London
has put up cash to test the Biting area, so
that Anderson’s float, in 600 shares of a
tenner, to buy the prospecting rights from
the Bruix co. and get on with preliminary
work o la Henderson, has an excuse. One
doubt about all these oil ventures in the
Dutch East Indies is how far aliens will be
let in. John Bull knows the risks, and if
he is fluttering cash close by it may be worth
following him, especially at an hour when
he is doing So much for his youngsters in the
Dominions.
Rumors regarding a breakdown of the
Takuapa dredge are officially denied. “The
dredge is continuing its trial run, and every-
thing is working smoothly,” says the report
from the office.
Ratrut (F.M.S.) considerably improved
its position during the year, the 281 tons
tin oxide recovered placing the co. over
£30,000 on the right side. Chairman Kerry,
recently over there, speaks of a new pro-
perty which should add six years to the one
year ahead of the old ground : but details of
this and whether £7500 can be spared for a
shilling div. remain for the meeting in July.
Scrip lias moved from 6s. 6d. to 9s. 3d. on the
prospects.
♦ * * *
Taranaki Oilfields Co. (M.L.) has been
extending its operations and areas over the
hills from Taranaki towards the East Coast
where petroleum seeps abound. F. G. Clapp,
the American geologist on whose advice
Taranaki was floated, has been engaged since
Christmas surveying the petroliferous coun-
try from north of Gisborne on Poverty Bay
to south of Napier on Hawkes Bay. His pre-
liminary reports impelled the Taranaki Co.
to buy 33,000 more fully-paid £1 shares in
the Gisborne Oil Proprietary Co. Previously
they held 7000 shares, so they now control
the Gisborne Co. and its properties. “Prince”
Baillieu and A. E. Broue sailed for London
last week to arrange the flotation of a com-
pany to develop the Gisborne areas. Geo-
logically the east coast is more settled than
the west coast, although little drilling has
been done apart from scout bores.

Westralian Mines Department draws atten-
tion to the prospects of Northampton lead
field, situated a little north of Geraldton.
Export figures dating back to 1850 indicate
a contribution from this field of 80,456 tons
of lead valued at £1,415.436 and 30,829
tons of copper valued at £268,271. Most of
the mines that produced that wealth are
now idle. They ceased operations not be-
cause of impoverishment but because the
market price of lead fell below the profit-
able line. Principal mine now working is
the Surprise, in which the Government, hold-
ing a mortgage, has a big say. For some time
the average return from this show was
37 p.c. metallic lead, but latterly, owing to
the practice of picking ore having been
stopped, it has been 111 p.c. The Surprise
has several lodes, and in one place where
they are close together, the whole forma-
tion is mined in an open cut over a width of
40ft. No development of any importance
lias been done below 110 ft., and so far no
eagerness has been shown to do any.
A German firm has been inquiring into
the prospects of turning Tasmanian coal to
account in the production of benzol and tar,
huge quantities of which are imported into
Germany. W. D. Reid, who represents the
Speck at Wembley, and is one of the Govern-
ment geologists, has been deputed to visit
Berlin with a view to inducing the Gesell-
scliaft to send an engineer to report.

Out of harness one week and down with
a cold the next, Byron Moore, the patri-
archal ex-sec. of the Y.R.C., did not live long
to enjoy his leisure. The fine, active old fel-
low closed his account at 86 this week.
Matthew Gibney, ex-Bishop of Perth, who
died this week at the age of 00, put in 23
years, from 1887 to 1910,, as head of the
ft:C. Church in W.A: The most paragraphed
episode in all his ecclesiastical career hap-
pened, however, in Victoria in 1880. As a
travelling priest, he found himself at Glen-
rowan when the Kelly gang were making
their last stand against the police and out-
raged society, and forced his way into the
burning hotel, at no little personal risk,
to minister to the spiritual requirements of
the wounded or dying outlaws. He will
always be remembered as an energetic pre-
late with a flair for finance as well as
theology. In W.A. he sought to augment
the Church’s revenues by various invest-
ments and speculations which didn’t always
turn out successfully; amongst other hazard -
ous enterprises lie once purchased and con-
trolled a daily newspaper (the Perth Morn-
ing Herald) which died on his hands.
Bishop Clune succeeded him 15 years ago,
since when he had lived in retirement.
There was surprise in some circles because
E. ,T. Kavanagh didn’t again get Ministerial
office in N.S.W. The reason is simply that
he already holds a public office—on the
Board of Trade —which brings him in a few
hundreds a year.
One man who refused to mourn over
Amundsen when lie vanished into the blue
in the direction of the North Pole was Cap-
tain Wilkins, the noted Australian explorer
of frozen icecaps and Northern Australian
“deserts.” Having himself lived in plenty
for long periods on Arctic ice and polar bear,
he declared that he would feel no anxiety for
the overdue aviator until next February and
not very much even then. He proposes when
he gets the money to make a similar air dash
of 1500 miles along the Antarctic seaboard
with the object of establishing meteorological
stations whose observations he claims are
indispensable to the accurate forecasting of
Australian weather; and his peregrinations
will include a visit to this end of the world’s
axle. It will take 17 hours to fly there, and
if his ’plane gets frosted-in like Amundsen’s
it may take him a matter of three years to
walk back.
From a correspondent in Italy :
Mussolini is said to be ill with cancer of the
duodenum and partial paralysis of the face. A
disease of youth, it is whispered, has so weakened
his constitution that an operation would be danger-
ous. In consequence he is embittered and obstre-
perous, refusing to obey doctor’s orders to live
quietly. Assassination he had conceived possible,
but never a lingering death through an incurable
complaint. And the sceptre is passing from him,
for between them Fascists Federzoni and Farinacci
really rule, and plots are thick all around.
Denny, Attorney-General in Sou’stralia,
has been suffering from pleurisy. He was
able to tell an interviewer, however, that the
birthday honor given to Archibald Strong
may perhaps be taken as Imperially con-
ferred, the Professor being at the present
moment on a visit to London. Otherwise
it will come under review when Parliament
meets, like the New Year title given to
David J. Gordon. S.A. Assembly passed last
year a resolution that titles should not be
locally given unless it has first voted on
them, and the Gunn Ministry strongly re-
sents any Federal recommendation without
a State backing.

W. F. DUNN,
Minister for Agri-
culture in the new
Labor Govern-
ment of N. S.
Wales —he polled
most votes in the
Caucus election
of Ministers.
Amongst June birthdays is that of the
G.O.M. of Tasmanian municipal life. Dan
Burke, of Whiteford Hills —99 on the 26th.
His association with public life dates back
to the year one of municipal government in
the Speck and included a long spell in the
Leg. Assembly. For over 30 years he was
Warden and Chief Magistrate of Westbury
municipality, and in his day has argued the
point with a couple of generations of the
island's lawyers. Seventy years or so ago
he helped the exiled Irish patriot John Micliell
to escape. First he rowed him down the 1 amar
to the ship that didn't wait for him. 1 hen,
after a weary battle back against tide and
storms, and finally through the bush, Dan
Burke daringly rode with his charge right
into Launceston, whence, clean shaven and
dressed like a priest, Michell journeyed by
coach to Ilobart and thence to U.S.A. and
Ireland and to election to the House of Com-
mons. After nearly TO vears of continuous
service Mr. Burke retired from public life a
few years ago. Apart from failing eyesight
his faculties are still keen, lie has a tribe
of descendants, and was well and worthily
represented in the Great Scrap.
G. H. Carter, who retired in 1914 from the
Vic. Education Department after 47
years’ active service, is to be honored by
the present generation of pods at a social
evening and presented with souvenirs of their
continued affectionate esteem, lie is now
managing a secondary school in his sixtieth
year of actual teaching, lie was always in the
van in the fight for decent conditions, and
after his retire-
ment continued to
work for his old
friends. If the
S n i> e r animation
Bill is placed on
the Statute Book
it will be mainly
through his 41
years’ battling. A
grateful service lias
determined to make
his valedictory
something to be
remembered.
E. A. PAINTER,
just elected presi-
dent of Melbourne
Trades Hall
Council. He is
Federal Secretary
of the Textile
Workers.
Michael Terry, who is to join Lord Apsley
in a motor-car voyage of exploration in Cen-
tral Australia, has been there before. In
11)23, with a mate and a second-hand Lizzie,
he travelled from Winton (Q.) to Broome,
2700 miles. They took four months to coyer
the 250 miles from Winton to Oloncurry. doing
odd jobs on the way to make a little money.
The Ford had cost £5O, and £lBO more was
spent on equipment. The Diamantina was
in flood, and the trip nearly ended in the
middle of the river. From Cloncurry the
route led to Camooweal and thence to An-
thony’s Lagoon, where they slept in the lock-
up. Alexandria, said to be the largest
cattle-station on the earth, was a port of
call. Across the plain there are Government
wells every 20 miles, and the windmills used
for pumping acted as lighthouses to the trav-
ellers. A stop was made at Newcastle
Waters, on the overland telegraph line. After
that the Murranji Desert was entered —re-
garded by bush men as the worst track in the
Northern Territory. At the end. of the
Barkly Tableland Terry and his mate had
to cut a siding to let the car down 200 ft.,
the track being nearly perpendicular. After
almost perishing of thirst, the < adventurers
Anally reached Broome via Hall’s Creek and
Derby. It was a gallant voyage and a tri-
umph for Terry and his companion.
“Labor Student” reviews their past:—
Of the 13 Labor Ministers in the new Ma State
Cabinet, eight have held portfolios, nine are natives
of the State, and the average age of the lot is 43.
Lang is 49. Born in Sydney, he dabbled in muni-
cipal politics before his election for Granville in
1913. A conservative at heart, he is dull and
stubborn, but pugnacious when aroused. Lougblin
(Lands), 43, was born at Braidwood (N.S.W.).
He gave up school-teaching and entered Parliament
in 1917 for Burragorang. Conscientious and level-
headed, he is the pick of the bunch. Dunn (Agri-
culture) also did a turn at school-teaching before
tns election for Mudgee in 1910. A Queanbeyan
native, he is 48, served in the war, rising from
private to captain, and is the most popular and
perhaps the best-informed country member. Cann
(Health and Local Government) is the father of
the Cabinet. Born in mining England in 1871, he
was for three years Federal member for Nepean, and
donned khaki while M.L.A. for Canterbury. Bluff
and rugged, but cool, he carries a lot of weight in
Caucus. Mutch, Minister for Education for the
second time, owns up to 40 and came from the
fold Country' when a lad. Rouseabout, journalist
m the Worker, and president of the A.J.A., he was
a close friend of Henry Lawson. A nature lover, lie
spends his spare time rambling in the bush. Attorney-
General McTiernan is a pale ascetic of 33. and the
only bachelor in the Ministry. A Glen Innes native,
he began life as a Commonwealth clerk. He is a
logical but colorless speaker. Mclvell (Justice),
also 33, hails from Pambula (N.S.W.), and is a
boilermaker. He is an enthusiastic amateur boxer
and footballer and a most modest member of the
A.L.P. Lazzarini (Chief Secretary), brother of
Hubert Peter of the same surname in Federal politics,
was once a tailor and came into the world in 1881
at Young (N.S.W.). He beat T. S. Crawford for
Marrickville in 191 V after a long industrial apprentiie-
ship as secretary of the Clothing Trades Union. A
tiery little man, lie reveals his Italian ancestry in
his passion for florid gesticulation. Baddeley (Mint-
and Labor), another importation, is in his middle
forties. Always inclined to the Left Wing, he ha-
fought hard for the admission of the Communists to
the A.L.P. He is a stranger to Ministerial work
and is only sure of himself when discussing mining
.or industrial matters. Flannery, another novice and
in charge of Works and Railways, suffers from the
same disability, his single-track mind running to land
and agricultural questions. Born at Bannedmau
(N.S.W.), he is 38, and started work as a printer’s
devil on the Wyalong Star, was a carrier and farmer
and was returned for Murrumbidgee five years ago.
after canvassing the electorate for seven week- on
a push bike. Fitzgerald, the surprise appointment,
for whom the unnecessary post of Assistant Minister
for Health and Local Government has been created,
comes from the South Coast, and is 38. fie has been
secretary of various trades unions and was sent to
macquarie-street by the cookies of Oxley in 1920.
Willis, leader of the party in the Upper House, is
a Welshman and a year younger than Cann. Once
a red-hot socialist, he has modified his views con-
siderably, and is the most astute member in a
movement overflowing with “shrewdies.” The thir-
teenth, Coates (Honorary Minister), a commercial
traveller, gf years of age, is a first-class platform
man and has put in a tremendous lot of spadework
for the party.
“Selinorrer”: Just dead in England Sir
David Lionel Salomons, Bart., who married
a daughter of the Jacob MontefiOrc whose
life in Australia was punctuated by benefac-
tions. The first Sir David Salomons was
elected to the British Commons, but declined
to take the Christian oath, lie was fined
after heavy costs had been run up, but his
fight resulted in the oath being altered.
Baron Lionel de Rothschild was the first to
benefit, but Salomons followed him into Par-
liament. When Gladstone provided him with
a baronetcy, a special arrangement was made
whereby, by special remainder, his adopted
nephew should succeed him; but as the
nephew’s only child was a victim of the win
the baronetcy expires. Salomons augmented
a very large fortune with the proceeds of
inventions. His home in Kent is reputed to
have been the first private house where elec-
tric power was applied for domestic purposes,
the plant being installed in 1874.
H. L. Goldbeck, who came from the U.S.A.
to teach the S.A. Railways how to manage
their finance, has given notice that when
his three years' term is up he is going home.
He came only at the desire of his old chief,
W. A. Webb, who had been imported as S.A.
Railways Commissioner, and he has never
been able to induce his wife and family to
follow him. Goldbeck was responsible for
plastering Adelaide station and its ap-
proaches with advertisement-hoardings, run-
ing instead of leasing out the bookstall there,
and selling the buns at Murray Bridge and
seven other of S.A.’s railway refreshment-
rooms.

MACLEOU MACPHAIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Light up your pipes for a salty lay that sings of
the days of sail,
A song of the roaring, windbag days when 1 sailed
wi’ Macleod Macphail',
A liard-Case Scot of an olden day, with a thin,
stiff upper lip,
Who’d chance if something carried away to get the
speed on his ship.
When the wind was right and the gear was tight
and the log showed twelve-point-three,
Then his jaw was set and his eyes were bright with
the pride of his years at sea.
l<’or Mac was a sailor from Sailorville, with all
the spunk of his clan,
Bei-ding a ship to his stubborn will with tiie
suuigth of a Hielandnian.
Mac was a man with a grown-up mind and the heart
and soul of a boy;
Though his ways were harsh, still his heart was
kind, and his ship was his grown-up toy.
He’d pull her to bits and build her up, like a lad
with a plastic set ;
And he did not worry for bite nor sup while Ins
soul with the spray was wet.
Truck to keelson and .stem to stern, a sailorman
true and brave,
Who battled and cared not what he’d earn this side
of a watery grave,
Setting the stunsails when winds were light and
cracking on in a gale,
Seeing ahead with uncann.y sight that was Macleod
Macphail!
I met Macphail when the war was on. Though the
years had wandered by
’Twas the same old Mac that I gazed upon, with the
same old glint in his eye.
His hair was grey; and his wrinkled face, tanned
with the tempest’s shocks,
Brought to me visions of lee-fore-brace and the
cursing of countless blocks.
Face to face after twenty years, in a Mediterranean
port,
Both of us landed in quaint Algiers in naval jobs
of a sort;
Mac marooned on a “sweeping” craft, and I on a
naval tug;
As he shook my hand he grimly laughed in tune
with his shoulders’ shrug!
“This is no game,” he said with a frown, “for a
sailorman to play.
The blinking Navy has got us down and —mark me—
she’ll have her way.
Flying a blanked lootenant’s bands on a d —d hot-
water can,
With never a sailor amongst your crew, but soldiers
every man !
Fakements to blow up submarines, smoke-screens to
blur their way—
If it’s sailor’s work in these d —d machines it’s
sorry I’m here to-day !
But it’s too late now to take a pull. It seems like
a loathsome dream.
Gi’e me white sails wi’-their bellies full and the
wind abaft the beam !
“Do ye mind the time in the Wings o’ Dawn, when
we ran our easting clown
With hardly a stitch o’ canvas on till we came to
Melbourne town ?
Straining her guts till the pumps grew tired of
keeping the water low—
But her speed was all that a man could ask, aji;l
God! that was good to know!
i’m dodging now on a trawling scow, out here for
my country’s sake—
Two stripes and a curl’s my part of the show, and
I—l am just a fake !
A cog in a wheel and a paltry one; and I fear
that my wits will fail,
If this thrice-damned war is not quickly done, and
I get me back to sail.”
But Mac was settled, like many more, in a scrap
with a submarine —
Fritzie and he three miles off shore both slithered
to Fiddler’s Green!
For the whole “duration” he couldn't stay ; he
died at his country’s call—
Took his discharge in a seaman’s way and went down,
stripes and all!
I can see his quaint old shoulders shrug. I can
hear the laugh he laughed
(I marocned on a naval tug, and he on a sweeping
craft) ;
And my thoughts go back to the good, old clays when
the pulse of the sea was Sail,
While my heart keeps singing its meed of praise for
the ghost of Macleod Macphail!
LONGSHORE.

“Morob”: In New Guinea, especially on
the north-western coast, natives with fair hair and
blue and grey eyes are sometimes met. These are
not in any way albino types, but are, it seems,- bio-
logical sports of some sort, as also are probably Mrs.
Bates's fair abos. in W.A. Nature has suddenly and
by some inexplicable method taken, apparently, a
short cut to a point which under ordinary circum-
stances would not have been reai hed for thousands
of years. From a scientific viewpoint, Mrs. Bates’s
theory—that the fair-skins are the descendants of
the progeny of shipwrecked sailors of many years
ago—is hardly thimble. Experience elsewhere, such
as the isolation of a handful of a white race among
a black race, goes to show that in all but a few-
rare cases the preponderating color rapidly absorbs
the other, all traces of the latter disappearing in a
few generations.
“Bunyn” : How i.s it that every small tribe
of Australian blacks had a different dialect, seeing
that anthropologists are satisfied as to their common
origin? I am convinced that the explanation is to
be found in one custom which was common among
all the tribes. The blacks had a childish fear of
death and believed that the spirit of a dead man
could return and harm them, and that the use of
his name would bring the unwelcome ghost to earth
at once. It was therefore forbidden ever to use
that word after his death ; and as the name of a
blaekfellow was nearly always a common word like
“Hawk,” “Sundown,” “Little Waterhole,” or an ex-
pression such as “Go Away,” “Left Behind” and so on,
an entirely new word had to be coined after a death.
Is it any wonder that in the course of countless
generations each tribe spoke, an entirely different
dialect ?

"Jim Carew” : When 1 hear anyone extol-
ling the carpet- cv diamond-snake as a ratter 1 feel
inclined to throw
something at him. The
non - venomous snake
does not compare with
the venomous as a
hunter, The rats seeni
to know instinctively
that the carpet or dia-
mond is a fair fighter,
and are prepared to
give him a go for it.
Certainly, he will clear
them out eventually',
but lie takes a long
time about it. An
nude of mine on the
Lower Havvkesbury,
who goes in exten-
sively for corn-grow-
ing, had two big rat-
i nfested barns, an d
proposed to put a pet
carpet-snake in each
with a view to killing
the rodents. At my re-
quest, however, he put
both snakes in the
same barn and then
loosed a four-foot
brown snake in the
other. Within a fort-
night there wasn’t a
rat in the latter pre-
mises. Those that had
managed to dodge the
brow n snake had
moved across, and, in
spite of the presence
of the two carpet pets,
remained there until a
brown snake was put in. He speedily settled their
hash.

“Piik” : When lately the big ’Bidgee flood
soughed over the flats at Jugiong (N.S.W.) a herd
of goats and seven horses were marooned on a low
knoll at the southern bend round the Point. The
horses stood stolidly watching the water gradually
nearing them, but the goats circled hurriedly with
plaintive and frightened cries. Presently, when the
water began to lap over the summit of the mound,
one old William led off for shore. With half a
dozen others he landed safely, but the weaker
nannies and kids were caught in the swirl that
foamed under the bluff at Cooney’s Hill. Then the
loyal leader and his followers took to the water
again, and with piteous bleating set out after the
drowning ones. The current took them all around
the Point, and they' were seen no more. By this
time the horses were standing shoulder deep in
the rising water. One tall fellow plunged off and
made- for the projection of the bluff, which steadied
the whirlpool that was sweeping Lloyd’s flat. But
the current was too strong for him. After a long
struggle he too disappeared. Night came with his
six mates still on the knoll, only their backs and
heads showing above the water. In the morning it
A GOOD TIME COMING.
“Mister, just tide us over this cold time—I got a good job ahead
o' me."
“My man, what job can you get?"
“Mister, I’m goin’ to be one of the beer-guides to the Ameri-
can Fleet."
had fallen to their knees. As the light advanced
they commenced circling, and their plunging told
that the foothold was bogging. Then they started
off together, following the current to where, a mile
away, the flood dammed against the ridge at Widgin
guiltn. Their judgment proved right; but they
were a shivering and bedraggled lot when they
staggered ashore on the Sandy Rises.
“Emel”: When “J.D.C.” (B. 21/5/’25)
says that the individual fibres of wool do not
increase in diameter, how does he account for
the fact that when last season’s clip reached the
mills it was found to be coarser in fibre than wool
of exactly similar class had been in previous years?
if you part the wool on a lamb you will find it
difficult to see the skin, so closely are the fibres
crowded. When that lamb is full-grown the fleece
looks as dense, but if the wool is parted the skin
i> easily' seen.
“Larrapinta”: I struck an old mate re-
cently who, when I left him a good many years ago,
was a martyr to asthma. 1 was surprised to find
him hale and hearty. When I asked what had cured
his complaint he informed me that he had been
living with his son, who has a farm in the mallee
on Eyre Peninsula (S.A.). One day he tried mixing
mallee leaves with tobacco in his pipe to relieve his
breathing, and found that in the course of a few
months it effected a complete cure.
“Der Jong”: The processional caterpillar
which has been engaging the attention of Abo. scribes
is under suspicion of being an undesirable immigrant
in Natal. Before the plantations of Australian wattle
were started there, the “bag-worm,” as he is called,
from his paper-bag tree-nest, was unknown. Now-
lie is something of a curse, stripping the wattle
plantations bare of leaves and turning his attention
to other tucker when that supply fails. Natal, which
does a big trade in wattle-bark, is worrying about
the future, and Australia may soon have to pay
more for importing the prepared product of its
native trees grown overseas.

“Cycas” : Three hawks that are farmers’
friends because of the mice they eat are the nankeen
kestrel, black-shouldered kite hawk and the grey
goshawk. The first two are usually seen hovering
over hay'stacks and fields of wheat on the lookout for
mice. The goshawk goes quietly and not so openly
about his work. Though energetic about catching
vermin, the kestrel sometimes gets too tired to buil l
a nest, and occupies that of a babbler, a crow' or
a magpie. This bird kills baby hares, and, w'hat
is more, carries them up into trees. No other
bird of its size can do that. Poisoned mice thrown
abiut on the surface, instead of being buried,
account for the scarcity of these three useful hawdis.
"A. E. Yarra : When Patch, the redoubt-
able brumby of Bendina station, and once known as
“the Brumby King” of the Nebine River (Q.), had
left most of the upper clothing and a good deal of
the skin of the best scrub-dashers on three rivers
hanging in strips on the mulga, it was time to'
think of something. So Charlie Barker, the mus-
terers’ boss, decided to try “coaches.” There was
a great overhauling of bridles, girths and other
lilting gear for the
final flutter. This was
to be the last try, for
the horse and his ton-
sorts had to be re-
moved from the coun-
try where they were
taking quiet and valu-
able stock-horses from
the camps. If the
“coaches” failed it
was the rifle and a
swift end at the water-
holes for the mob. It
was one of the wildest
rides ever known on
the station, and is
talked of along the
rivers to this day.
Riders were posted
along the route, hidden
in the scrub at certain
points to take up tile
running as others
pulled out. A few
miles at a racing pace
in this fashion saw
even the leader dis-
tressed and the greater
portion of the mob
knocked up. On a
plain the “coaches”
were cantering along,
appan ntly unattended,
and Patch after a while
joined them. They
were headed for the
long wing of mulga
fencing that ran down
to the camouflaged
yard, and when at last
the rails were up and
the pegs driven home,
there was a wild howl
of joy. On went the
rollers and the mouth-
ing gear that night,
and next day they
broke Patch in, riding
him to a standstill, and
sorry only that he
could not buck as he
could gallop. A week
later, hollow-eyed, lop-
eared. sunken-flanked,
the picture of misery
in liorsehide, he was turned out in the horse-
paddock, a broken-in hack, guaranteed quiet. The
marks of his shame were the saddle sweat-marks. He
never held his head up again. No one saw him
eat or drink from that day, and a week or so
later he lay down on the bjuegrass plain and died.
“Slam”.; Who says railway navvies lack
imagination? Apart from his flow' of picturesque
language in times of argument, the artist of the
ling-handled banjo has a decided gift for nomen-
clature, and every little canvas 12 x 10 see:-
along the line has a name. I took note of some o 4
these when the mail train from Brisbane to Towns-
ville stopped opposite a row of tents. They in-
cluded “The Flat,” “Two-up Villa.” “The Country
Seat,” “Locksley l-lall,” “Fettler’s Fancy,” “Alham-
bra,” “Quoth the Raven.” “Paddv’s Delight” ami
“Buckingham Palace.”
THE CYNIC'S DAY OUT.
MIND-READER: “Korf be jiggered! You ain't
got no korf! You don't want th' bogs
to see that noo tie the missus give yer!"
“Yarrum": Some time ago I mentioned
cabbage-tree heart as a sure cure for indigestion
Last night 1 met a man who had tried all known
remedies, and was cured by a “couple of feeds of it.”
You want to get a young palm, and the ones with
the best and milkiest hearts are found in gullies in

THE GALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her robes of blue arid gold the Day
Has laid aside, and now
She walks in gown of sombre grey
Along the hills of Howe.
In savage sport, in slimy greed,
A snarling surge since morn
The kelp and sponge and c olored weed
From rock and reef has torn,
And strown it on the sands, whose white
Hands sweep it in disdain
Upon receding tides at night
Back to the seas again.
The east wind, racing o’er the Strait,
Shouting his battle call,
Strips long brown ribbons from the straight,
Autumnal trunks of tall,
Higli-crested eucalypts that sway
Their troubled boughs in grief
For riven limbs torn swift away
And scattered branch and leaf.
Some, shallow-Vooted, luckless, crash,
A pressure fierce beneath;
These, stringy-bark and mountain-ash,
Plucked from their earthy sheath,
Fall stiffly down like dead men slain
In battle by the spears
Of foemen, careless of their pain
And heedless of their tears.
From torrents new is heard a roar
Of churned flood-waters white
With froth. They tumble o’er and o’er
Such victims as their spite
Can sweep to turgid doom afar,
Where, lion-mouthed, the waves
Leap hungrily across the bar
And drag them to their graves.
Stark things of fur and feather, taught
In forest nest or lair,
Are thus from their dominions brought
As offerings unaware
INTELLIGENT ANTICIPATION.
“What's Congo flying off for?”
“His old woman's going to gire him a hidin', so 'e’s gettin' 'ome
before the old man, so she won't givre IM the job.”
Unto the altars of the Storm,
Whose long, cloud-arms are curled
In spiral waterspouts that form
Above the water-world.
As ladies sweep from lacy sleeves
Th<s touch of love o’er-bold,
Green tree-ferns shake their rain-wet leaves
In gullies dark and cold.
With ancient grief the she-oaks slim
On misty ridges croon
Through dripping tears, the constant hymn
They sing by night and noon.
The burnished bronzewings, beak to beak,
Make sheltered, soft debate.
A mottled wonga down the creek
Calls anxiously its mate.
But these, or black duck by the shore,
Or teal the sedge bchin 1,
1\ e may not hear above the roar
Of forest, sea and wind.
To-night the clumsy wombat jogs
Not far afield, nor roots
For wonted yams ; nor from their logs
Creep timid bandicoots.
All Bushland nature, crouching, hides
In burrow', nest or lair,
And in its Bushland fashion bides
A season calm and fair
When, once again in robes of blue
Anl gold and green, the Day
Will tread our bush and jungle through;
And round the lake and bay
The genii of the Storm, in thrall.
With wicked shares will plough
No more the halcyon lands that call
Around the hills of Howe.

Good-bye to the Rabbit Pest!
You can quickly clear your acres of rabbits and KNOW that the
is not even a sole survivor, if you use
FUMO
BRAND
CALCIUM CYANIDE.
It leaves not a vestige of hope for the rabbits. They MUST
succumb to its death-dealing fumes. These fumes are
generated INSIDE the warren, where they retain their fatal
power for at least twenty-four hours. They penetrate everv
dead-end, and a dust cloud discloses every
opening to the warren.
Apply CALCIUM CYANIDE with the
Fumo Dust Blower. It is simple, safe
and economical to use, and approved by
everybody.

“Geo. Rich”: We were viewing a South
Groperland pioneer homestead. Across the valley I
indicated a cork-tree three-quarters of a century old.
Our lady friend, mistaking the direction, gazed
upon several fruitful olive trees. “Oh, yes,” said
she, and then, noting the olives, “and look at all
the tiny corks on the trees. How long will it he
before they are ripe?”
* * * *
“Bouragi”: A sea-snake was captured at
Manly (N.S.W.) recently, after a big blow had
subsided. Though periodically cast up on N.S.W.
beaches, they are denizens of tropical waters, and
are only found as far south after storms or when
they have wandered too far into a southerly-setting
current. The Manly specimen was a small green
one, and, like all its kind, with a keeled body and
THE DEMANDS OF ART.
"Urry up, Bombardon, we’re waitin’ on ’ee.”
“’Ave bit av patience, caan’t ’ee? After all them runs I’ve been
playin’ I must ’ave time to clean ’er out.”
tail flattened to a paddle, but with no such definite
dividing line between head and body as could be
called a neck. There are many species of these
snakes, large and small, and all are highly poisonous,
though the fangs are small. North Queensland
waters are full of them in the summer, especially
inside the Barrier, and can be seen by hundreds
basking on the surface off the n.-e. coast of Papua.
They are supposed to be helpless out of water, bur
there is a fo’c’s’le yarn of one climbing up the
cable of a man-o’-war anchored in the Hooghly
years ago, and fatally biting the middy of th"
watch who tried to throw it overboard.
“Wiremu”: My old friend Haimona, the
tohunga, was deprecating the loss of the old-time
Maori belief in tapu. I asked him if he had know-
ledge of any recent occurrence in which interference
with tapu had been punished, and he told me this
tale. Some years ago Maoris were cutting grass-
seed in Onauku Bay,
under the supervision
of Taniora the Chief,
a person of great mana,
the leavings of whose
food was like poison
to the common folk.
Their camp was about
two or three miles
distant from the grass-
cutting operations, and
one day after break-
fast Taniora put the
remnants of his food
in a kit for lunch
later on; but, some-
thing intervening, he
did not go with the
grass-seeders. hunch
time came, and a
woman found Taniora’s
food, and, not know-
ing it belonged to the
Chief, ate it. She was
immediately seized
with cramps in the
stomach and had con-
vulsions. They im-
mediately took her on
the boat and made for
camp. Taniora saw
them coming, and, at
once divining the rea-
son, went in his own
craft to meet them.
The woman had turned
a purple hue, foam
was on her lips and
her limbs were dis-
torted. Taniora knew
what to do. He took
a strand of her hair
between his teeth and
murmured an incanta-
tion. In five minutes
the woman had re-
gained her normal
color, and in half an
hour was up talking
and joking with the
rest over her experi-
ence. Haimona was in the boat with Taniora when
all this was done.

“Veronal”: The honor of discovering that
the porcupine-anteater, or echidna (echidna hystrix ),
reproduced by means of “soft-shelled eggs” belongs
to Caldwell, an English naturalist, who brought this
interesting fact to
light about the middle
of 1880. But in the
same year Carl Lum-
holtz, a Danish
scientist, was making
a close study of the
pore, in the N.Q.
wolds, being accom-
panied by one of the
Coomooboolaroo sta-
tion boys , and an abo-
riginal w'ho assisted
him in his search. He
came across a lady
porcupine from whose
pouch they took an egg
about “half the size
of ■ a hen’s egg and
covered with leathery
skin like that of the
iguana.” Lumholtz
continued his inquiry
into the animal’s
breeding habit and
examined a large
number of echidnas.
He found what has
since been generally
acknowledged, v i z.,
that the ovaries are
constantly increasing
in size during the
breeding season —about
February and March —-
chile, according to the
aboriginals, the young
are born in April or
May. Eggs nearly
mature were taken by
him from the ovaries
in March, the mamma
of the ispecimen ex-
amined being then
much swollen and full
of milk. An Adelaide
observer, Haacke, also
discovered an egg
about the same time,
but Caldwell first definitely proved that the pore,
reproduces in the same manner as its fellow mono-
treme the platypus, or duck-bill.
“Gouger”: Tongo was our best carrier,
but one day he refused to carry, as he said he was
“sick.” He certainly did seem to have a sort of
fever, and a.s quinine had no effect I bribed a
neighboring witch-doctor to cure him —a pipe and
half a pound of trade tobacco if he succeeded; no
results no pay. The old man came across and
silently gazed at the invalid stretched on the
giound. Tongo’s eyes went a bit whitev under the
cold stare. The witch-doctor squatted beside the
patient and began mumbling dreamily. He then used
a bit of mesmeric handplay, the passes, like the
strokes of a cat's paw, travelling creepily from the
patient’s forehead down the body to the pit of the
stomach. This treatment occupied half an hour.
SINCERITY UNREWARDED.
“ ’Sense me, Mr. Parson, but does God answer prayer?”
“Certainly he does—if it is sincere.”
“Well, ’ow is it I go on losing at the two-up school?”
Then old Skin-em-alive heaved a deep sigh and sat
back wearily. His diagnosis was that three pieces
of bone were eating their way through Tongo’■>
kidneys. He believed he could cure Tongo, though
he wasn’t sure. He crouched over the man mumbling.
Then Tongo’s eyes rolled. The witch-doctor, grunt-
ing savagely, jabbed down and with his teeth got a
hold on Tongo’s navel. The poor devil was too
scared to sing out, although it w'as plain he wanted
to—badly. The doctor grunted, tugged and groaned,
and eventually produced a bone realistically bathed
in Tongo’s blood! And with a square inch oi
Tongo’s hide. The doctor scowlinglv exhibited his
catch to the admiring audience, then bent down for
another. He got it, too, after a struggle with the
patient, and. eventually, after a still more violent
struggle, a third bone. He then sat back exhausted.
The pipe and ’bacca were handed over to him, and
Tongo got well without delay, hurrying off w'ith his
heavy pack like, a startled two-year-old. Incidentally,
old Pull-bones opened his ugly mouth for all to
gape into after each operation. Of course there
were no bones there, and of course the spectators
knew beyond doubt that they came from the far
interior of Tongo’s belly. Tongo himself was sure
of it!

“Lily Beale”: Queenie, a 14.2 pony
mare owned by Harry Heiler, of GuAargambone
(N.S.W.), is surely worth a par. on the dinkum
Aussie page. She has been competing at country
shows for the past six years and has captured over
70 ribbons, topping her performance by bringing
home 11 prizes from the recent Gulargambone
P. and A. showy She has now resigned, and is
being sent to the stud, and every horse-lover in the
West will miss and bless her.
* * * #
“Nikko”: The coming Dunedin Exhibi-
tion has sent sportsmen into the wilds of the
Dominion to seek specimens of the imported animals
liberated in the Southern Alps. A large thar, a goat-
like Himalayan animal, was the first creature to be
shot, but all efforts to get near the nimble chamois
failed. The chamois is extraordinarily agile and
quick of sight and scent, and a large herd will
gracefully spring into oblivion before the hunter has
any chance of securing one. As the season is agains'
hunting in the Alps at present, there is every chance
that the exhibition will have to open without a
shammy.
* * * #
“Bunya” : The row about the birth of tjie
kangaroo has been once more settled by additions
the Brisbane Museum. The collection of specimens
includes unborn, newly born, and more developed
marsupial young. One show's the embryo in the
womb, another when taken from it, amh a third
when newly-born. A number of other specimens
illustrate the developmental stages in the pouch.
Exhibited nipples show a series of small holes, not
one large one, so that it w r ould be impossible fo''
a marsupial to be born, as sometimes conjectured,
through that conduit.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar” : “Emu Crest” (B. 7/5/’25)
hasn’t got the full story of the camel who com-
plained about being bossed by a donkey. The
camel really complained, not to a sheik, but to Allah
when the latter asked him one day why he was
keeping up such an infernal grumbling. The ship
of the desert replied that he was fed up with his
job. “I don’t mind,” he said, “that you should
have given me a neck like a goose, a body like a
water-sack, legs like a crane’s, and capped it all with
a hideous hump; but it does get my goat that
I have to follow the direction of a stinking donk
that always walks at the head of me and my mates.'
The matter being ordained,, even Allah could not
alter it. As compensation, however, lie told the
camel his own secret name. The Wise Saints and
the Holy Imams know 99 of the 100 names of
Allah. Only himself and the camel know the other.
This is the reason for the infernally supercilious
expression of superiority to all other living creatures
which ever since has adorned the face of the camel.
“Tarago”: Can anyone explain this? A
local cocky owned a horse, dark bay and rising eight.
Suddenly white spots about the size of a sixpence
commenced to appear on his coat. These spread
slowly over the whole body until the hide resembled
that of a giant native-cat. The spots steadly in-
creased in size, and, finally merging into one an-
other, left the neddy a complete grey.
• * * «
“Lilli Pilli” : I don’t know what kind of
ants are annoying “Jimmy Possum,” but if they are
“road” or “meat” ants, let him run a circle of
coal tar around the nests. This will be sufficient
it he keeps renewing the tar; but should he wish
to expedite the massacre he’d better also dig a
hole in the nest and drop into it a few lumps of
carbide and pour on them some water, refill the
hole and go about his other business. Probably
the gas generated from the carbide kills a lot of the
tenants, but its main object is, to drive them int i
the tar, where they will sink head-first. I undertake
to eat any live ants found in a nest after this
ti e; tment.
* * * *
“Billy See”: White spiral shells are fairly
numerous in the district stretching from Southern
Cross (W.A.) to well out on the Trans, line. The
early diggers, seeing the vast accumulation of latcrite
gravels, imagined them to be water-deposited, and
pointed to the shells as conclusive proof that the
country had but recently risen from the sea. Scientific
theory is all the other way, and most geologists
believe that the West, Central plateau is about the
oldest exposed land on the globe. The shells are
snail-shells, but no one ever found a live snail in
that district. The presence of such fragile shells
seems to indicate that the desert conditions are
of quite recent origin, and that the desiccation of
Centralia must be proceeding at a fairly rapid rate.
“8.V.R.”: “J.D.C.” says (B. 21/5/’25)
that in sheep at any age from lamb to full-grown
“the staple is even.” It certainly appears toibe so
at a casual glance; but if “J.D.C.” will take a
small sample from any part of the fleece, wash it
and separate the fibres, he will find they vary in
length from a fraction of an inch to what is appa-
rently the full length of the staple. Wool continues
to grow up to the death of the sheep. It stands to
reason that as the fibre does not increase in diameter
new -wool must grow to keep the fleece of the same
denseness right through the life of the sheep. The
diameter of the fibre actually decreases with age;
henpe, a six-year-old ewe’s fleece is finer, and conse-
quently more valuable, than a first or second clip.
HER LITTLE COMING-OUT PARTY.
“Are yous ladies gain ter the reception this
after?”
“Wot reception?”
“Ho, did’n’ you know —Phyllis is cornin’
out.”
“Half-Moon” : Tlie Papuans about the Fly
River delta have the largest flutes in the world.
They get a bambpo as long and big as possible and
cut out longitudinal strips in alternate positions
between each notch. This is set up facing the
wind, and weird aeolian music is thus produced.
When a number of these flutes are going togethe:
in a strong wind, .the moaning of a thousand lost
souls would be a mere whisper by comparison.
WHEN THE BREAD REFUSED TO RISE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
* -or blirne, strike me handsome!
Gosh, so help me, how I laughed
When I i heard that old cook “roaring”—
Gee, I thought that she was daft!
First she stamped her feet and muttered,
Tore her hair and scratched her head,
Cried and shook her fist and shouted
“Someone’s doped my (something) bread.”
Then she shivered like a dingo
That has got a poisoned bait,
Cursed the heavens and the angels
And the souls in Hell, and fate;
Then she paused awhile and pondered,
’Ere she started off again.
While I sat and thought in silence
If the poor old girl was sane.
Next she did a sort of sidestep
And careered across the room—
Sort of doubled up as if she
Had a pain, then grabbed the broom
And turned upon the cowboy ;
But he bolted like a shot.
She consigned the whole dam’ outfit
To the regions that are hot.
She talked awhile of mongrels
(And of mongrelesses, too),
Of dirt, disease and Dagoes,
While around the floor she flew.
She seemed to have convulsions
For a minute, nothing less,
As her fingers beat a tattoo
On the waistband of her dress.
She gurgled, gasped and swallowed,
Spat, and slowly shook her head ;
Then she left the room (thank goodness !)
Saying “Blow the something bread!
She’s not a bad old soul at heart,
And harmful not the least ;
The trouble was she’d set her bread
And forgot the blooming yeast.
QUEENSLAND.

The firm of J.C.W. made Friday night at
His Majesty's a gala for Italy's visiting bird-
man. “Gor Save” and the Italian "National
Alarch” floated from the orchestral well be-
fore the curtain rose on “Primrose.” Deco-
rations were of gum-leaves with twinkling
colored lights amid flags, and balloons floated
from every chair. Above the proscenium an
illuminated ’plane hung against the two
countries’ flags. All performers sported
streamers of red, white and green, and the
piece went with a bang in front of a packed
house. The crimson mess jackets of the
military rubbing shoulders with the blue-
faced air force uniform and the gilded attire
of the navy made the feminine hooray look
pale. The chief guest of honor bowed his
thanks for an effusive welcome from a box
shared with his mechanic-companion, Cam-
panelli, the Consul and his Signora. Primin-
ister Bruce and Airs. Bruce, Gawd Alayor
and Airs. Brunton, Billy Hughes and Dame
Alary, Rear-Admiral and Airs. llall-Tliomp-
son and John Alonash were just a few of
the elect. The chilliness of the night pre-
vented the fair sex from discarding wraps,
so Spanish shawls and some rare-priced furs
were aired. Quite enviable were the bits
of ermine worn by the Waley dame, of Syd-
ney, Aliss Bentwitch, Signora Grossardi and
some others. General Chauvel s wife, who
was with her soldier, wore wrapping of the
leopard order.
The sky travellers are being feasted here
to a degree that is likely to make the Savoia
rise heavily when she takes flight for Sydney
shortly. At the hop at No. 9 Darling-street,
given by the A.A.F. officers, Alarcliese di
Pinedo showed himself a stunter at the one-
step. Wing-Commander and Airs. Williams,
the latter in a sheathing of silver brocade,
previously dined the guests of honor. Consul
Grossardi and his wife, whose robing was
black, and Air. and Airs. T. Trumble.
Furs and overshoes did homage to King
Fog at the June meeting of the V.A.T.C. on
Saturday. Every form of the wrap-over gar-
ment appeared, in cross-word puzzle check-;,
plain, striped or jaquered effects, fussed wool
or fur adorned, and millinery, hosiery and
footwear blended in the general scheme.
Airman Pinedo, leather-coated and felt-
hatted, strolled in the birdcage with
Priminister Bruce and Italian Consul Gros-
sardi. and later caused a flutter amid the
girls by joining the Consul’s wife and friends
in the members’ stand.
The smartest raiment was black, in those
nice three-piece suits of striped Ottoman silk
and satin which look luxurious and are priced
accordingly. Among the successful wearers
of these attractive goods were Airs.
S. At. Bruce, Airs. W. Roger Thomson and
Mrs. Weston Pett. Signora Grossardi cov-
ered her frock with a kolinsky wrap, and
brightened her sable millinery with gold.
Norah Currie was a slinky figure in a navy-
blue wrap-over, with a lighter blue headpiece
of the tam-o’-shanter mode.
John D. O’Hara made a mistake in not
putting on his revival of “The Laughter of
Fools” earlier, judging by the enthusiasm of
the full house at the Athenaeum on Saturday
night. Lorna Helms, as the parlormaid
Elizabeth, not only convulsed the audience,
but almost bowled over her fellow artists;
one actor held up the show while lie had his
laugh. It was good to see, for the situations
really were funny and clean. Zoe Wenke
wears some effective flapper-like clothing in
Wedgwood blue georgette over silver lace;
and a nutmeg-brown brocaded marocain robe
dangling some fringe. Maggie Jarvis gets
only one bit of pretty raiment, of cherry-
liued georgette and velvet, allied to white
millinery. Black chiffon velvet sparkling with
jet on gold tissue was Emma Temple’s glad-
dest attire.
St. Ivilda Town Hall displayed the blue
and gold of the Newman Society at the mem-
bers’ annual ball. This society, founded by
the late Archbishop Carr, embraces Catholic
University grads., the first president being
barrister T. C. Brennan, whose daughter
Laura was one of the evening’s debs. The
fixture is always the occasion of many
maidens making their first bow in society,
and 48 bobbed to president Dr. Maurice
AlacGillicuddy’s wife —a charming bunch, all
clad from neck to knee in white and carry-
ing pink posies. Forty-eight equally young
escorts grand-marched and performed the
Lancers "with the lasses in the manner of a
Court minuet. Mrs. AlacGillicuddy was
wrapped in silver brocaded tissue. Tne
duties of secretary fell on Drs. E. Scanlon
and T. Cotter. Of the gathering were Father
Murphy, rector of Newman College; H. I.
Cohen.' ALII.IL. and Mrs. Cohen, she wearing
cherry-beaded draperies; M. J. D. Page and
daughter Madeleine; Dr. and Mrs. Charles
Finn (she was Dolly Castles), and Eileen
Castles, with silver beads sparkling on eau-
de-nil frocking; Mrs. Lehane and her pretty
daughter Clare; Mrs. McAlary and Mr. and
Mrs. T. C. Brennan. The debs, included two
sisters of aviator Parer and Dr. Triado s
daughter.
To help the furnishing fund for the exten-
sion of the Tweddle Baby Hospital and
School of Mothercraft, an offshoot of the
Plunket system, some 400 of our sex dared
damp conditions and tripped into the
Oriental Hotel to take tea embellished with
bridge and a splendid musical accompani-
ment. Raffles and sales added a lot of money
to the proceeds. Mayoress Brunton gave
the opening benediction. The chief of start
of an army of energetic workers was Mrs.
,T. W. Springthorpe, wife of the enthusiastic
president of the hospital. Songbirds who
raised tuneful notes above the tinkle of tea-
cups included Airs. Howard Jolley, Airs.

tor Baxter. The Tivoli was represented

the Versatile Three. Actress June Elvidge.

was so much of a successful brigand that she
got £5 for a box of chocolates.
Yet another given in marriage last week
was Ilazell Austin, younger daughter of Airs.
Edwin Austin, of Toorak; f lic 'groom, of
the same suburb, being Richard Dauncey,
only son of Airs. Henri Dauncey. The bride,
who was attended by her sister, Airs. Linsley
Smith, of Ayr (Q.), wore simple trappings
of ivory embroidered georgette, topped by
a lioniton lace veil. The matron of honor
was a study in silver lace and blue draperies.
Biit few guests were bidden to the after-
ceremonies, as Airs. Austin had had a big
tea-drinking at the Hotel Windsor on the
nuptial eve. Airs. Linsley Smith also dis-
pensed tea and cake, with a sprig of heather,
at the Wattle.
Approved of by the Charities Board, sup-
ported by the Government to the extent of
£lO,OOO, patronised by the two vice-regal
ladies and launched by Alayor Brunton, the
appeal for £lOO,OOO to complete St. V incent s
Hospital has had its public send-off at the
Town Hall. There was a big attendance at
this first rehearsal for the great asking,
which will cover a period of five months,
commencing on July 1. It is the only occa-
sion in its 30 years of usefulness that St.
Vincent’s has put out its begging-bowl; and
judging from the tributes paid to the hospital
and its nursing staff by the doctors, there w,JI
be plenty of people throughout Victoria
ready to help pass it round. _ Out-patients
and in-patients, the poorest of the commu-
nity, get the best and up-to-datest treatment.
The hospital has its X-ray, electric baths and
violet rays department, but all are painfully
congested. The institution has a daily aver-
age of 128 in-patients; out-patients’ visits
last year totalled 87,970. The first enter-
tainment on the list for the appeal fund is
a ball in Fleet Week. The treasurer, Alayor
Brunton, has had a pleasant surprise to
begin with : £5OO dropped in from Air. and
Mrs. D. Slattery to start the bank on.
Noting the hundreds of folk who daily
visit hospitals with gifts for patients, Mrs.
James Angus asked a sceptical committee
why the insti-
tution itself
should not
reap the bene-
fit of some of
this buying.
The commit-
tee couldn’t
see much
money in the
scheme, but
the lady began
to collect
stock and
voluntary help-
ers. Result,
the Alfred
Hospital now
gets a good
four - figure
cheque a year
from its little
shop. Visitors
from all over
Australia come
to view the wonderful emporium, and go
home to propagate the new idea. A cus-
tomer once put a doubting request for clothes-
pegs. “How many do you require?” said the
smiling salesi-lady. planking the washing-
day accessories before her astonished pur-
chaser, who wondered whether a pearl-
necklet might not be hidden behind the new-
laids and the syphons of soda-water.
Brootliorn snapped this picture of the strong
head which bred the notion.
Something new in bridal trappings was
exhibited by Beryl Fiona Ludbrook when she
married Dr. Kenneth Hadley, eldest son
of Air. and Airs. 11. 11. Hadley, of Apple
Land —she was in the mode of good Queen
Bess’s day, her ivory satin opening over pink
and silver tissue with a Medici collar aud
silver-embroidered train. A trio of maids
were in delpliinium-blne georgette upion
mauve taffetas ; and the two trainbearers did
duty in similar up-to-date attire. Carlyon s
saw the cake cut, and the ’moon will loom
through Lunnon’s smoke. The bride is the
youngest daughter of the E. C. Ludbrooks
of St. Kilda.

The Tallis domicile at Toorak housed a
bridge party the other afternoon, attractive
articles for the feminine toilet-table being
the stakes. June Etvidge, who was the star
turn, said Spring was coming in wide-leafed
millinery of green supporting mauve blos-
soms above green raiment sombred with
black. Black satin dashed with red and
gold Chinese embroidery clothed the hostess ;
and her bonnie lass Biddy cheered up a
black frock with Oriental trimming. And
there were cosy fires and cakes and posies
for the visitors.
The Assembly Hall housed the second of
the series of lectures on French music written
by Calvocoressi, the French critic, for the
Alliance Frangaise. Evidently this lecture
lost something in translation. For a theme
so fascinating as “Music of the Court to
Romanticism” it left the musical with a
hollow feeling which the absence of the glad
setting of the first night intensified, and the
cold, dull panelling of the church-like hall
increased the atmosphere of cheerlessness. A
full house had accepted the invitation of
Mrs. Jimmie Dyer, who wore raiment of
lavender and silver. Reading of the lec-
turette fell to Mr. Claude Hall. Charming
songs illustrative of the periods were pro-
vided by Alma O’Dea. a Melba scholarship
winner, who glimmered in gold and green,
and tenor William Cadzow did some very
artistic work in numbers grave and gay.
The old folk at Cheltenham Benevolent
Asylum, had a treat recently when Wee
Georgie Wood paid them a visit. Tenor
Walter Kirby, who brought the comedian
along in his pocket, sang some old favorites
which pleased mightily. Of the party also
were Mrs. Fleming Dunstan, who raised her
bird-like soprano notes, Rosa Walton and
accompanist Natalie Dawson. By the way,
in acknowledgment of the nice cheque Kirby
was instrumental in raising for the Colling-
wood creche through the fine programme he
arranged at the cafe chflntant at the Fran-
eatelli recently, he has had a life governor-
ship thrust upon him.
Victoria’s Eye and Ear Hospital has a
Red Cross Auxiliary, too. At its first year’s
reckoning, it was able to say “Well done!”
The Meadow Fair held on boatrace days on
Henley lawns added £2500 to the appeal
for £30,000; and after doing various odds
and ends there was still over a hundred
pounds in the purse. Election of officers
made Mrs. Valentine president and Mrs. H.
Riddell-Stanley lion sec.
Phyllis Mary Gordon, the pretty daughter
of the F. G. Ormonds, of East Melbourne,
gave her promise last Thursday to Ander-
son Pole, second son of Dr. Alexander Pole,
of Bournemouth (Fogland). The bride’s
wedding attire was of white georgette with
attachments in silver bugle fringe and a veil
of old Brussels and Limerick lace. Cousin
Tony Gataker came from Cleveland (Q.)
with her mother to aid Sylvia Lane with the
bridesmaiding. After-rejoicings were held
at Cliveden. The honeymoon covers a trip
to England, and the roof-tree will eventually
be raised in the Malay States.
Sydney artist Muir Auld’s lone hand at
the New Galleries is attracting red tabs as
a magnet gathers iron-filings. Melbourne’s
brushes speak of his collection as something
not to be missed. The annual exhibition of
the Women’s Art Club was opened at the
Athenaeum. Mrs. George Russell, whose
husband is a practical patron with a habit
of buying good things, particularly if they
are Australian, greased the slips with a few
fluent words. Her presentation posy of
fuchsias from president Annie Gates bright-
ened up a coat-frock of black, squirrel-fur
trimmed.
As soon as the American Fleet festivities
are nicely over, the Harry Emmertons in-
tend jaunting to what Europe calls the Near
and F'ar East. "The lady, you know, is
mother of tennis-champion Brookes’s wife.
Max Meldrum, the individualistic brush-
man, who tries to paint things as they are, lias
decided to go abroad for a long stay. lie
is putting his house on the market and tak-
ing his wife and younglings with him, but
so far his intentions as to the journey’s end
are shrouded in mystery. On June 29 he
will hold a farewell exhibition of his work
at the Melbourne Athenaeum.
Bernard Heinze led the Melbourne’s Uni.
string quartette in a recital at the Assembly
Hall. The players declared war upon the
classics, giving them a somewhat noisy
modern rendering—they were happier in the
latter-day works, particularly the Glazounow,
which had warmth and rhythm.
Wide Bay’s representative in the Federal
Parliament, E. B. Corser, had a hasty sum-
mons to Bananaland on Saturday owing to
the serious illness of his wife.
Friday night found Trinity College stu-
dents having their annual party at St.
lvilda Town Hall, which was all prinked up
with ribbons, garlands and wreaths of red
and green, their colors. Warden Dr. Behan
and Mrs. Behan, vice-warden Blackwood and
his wife joined in, likewise the heads of
sister-colleges—Queen’s, Ormond and New-
man.
Mrs. Colin Fraser moved the furniture to
lit in the folk who invaded Salisbury, South
Yarra, to play bridge for the funds of the
local creche. Everybody who was anybody
and those who just peep through the palings
played to hearts, partook of tea and pur-
chased things to add to the banking-account
of the institution. Hostess wore black velvet,
bead-adorned, and millinery of beige hue.
Adelaide keeps itself warm: —
The tarantula bit our village in several places this
week. Society was bidden to godfather and god-
mother a new dance club at the Maison de Dance
at Glenelg, and at the Liberal Hall the W. G. T.
Goodmans gave a rose-decorated frivol for their two
daughters. The one-time pupils of Scotch College
and the Ladies’ Presbyterian ditto and even of the
Methodist Girls’ School at Wayville (despite the
horror-stricken outbursts at the Methodist Conference)
invited their contemporaries to come and maite merry
with them too. At the Goodman dance the be-
ribboned and be-rosed walls and lights made a
charming setting for some really smart dressing.
Mrs. Goodman was in black with touches of fine
lace and silver, her elder daughter in pale blue
satin with a hint of rose- at the waist, and her
younger in green and silver.
Apropos of dressing, W. J. Sowden, after wander-
ing in many lands, comes back to tell us that we
can’t walk, though he hopes we may learn; but
that in health, beauty, figure, features and freedom
of movement we are unsurpassed. The recipients
of these confidences were the feminine members of
the Liberal Union. But that association’s Senate
nominations are out, and there is no hint of W. J.
S.’s name among them. It was evidently a burst of
sheer altruism.
The Babies’ Hospital at Mareeba, founded when
Lady Galway was here and largely as a result of her
enthusiasm, has outgrown its quarters. Chief Secre-
tary Jelly, taken down to view the squash, suggested
plans for another building as big as the present one
—the new quarters to be used for the staff and the
present one for babies only. And he backed up
the suggestion with a hint that the Government
might put its hand in its pocket for the money.
The Administrator, w'ith a trowel presented by
Mrs. Lavingt.on Bonython, laid the foundation-stone
of the free kindergarten that is to be given to
Adelaide from the funds of the Keith Sheridan
estate. The building already has a piano up its
sleeve, thanks to a £lO5 cheque from a sister
kindergarten in Halifax-street.
The Victoria League chose art for its first lecture,
persuaded the fluent Van Raalte to do the talking,
and made the affair an afternoon instead of an
evening one. The result was a bumper house, over
which Mrs. T. Slaney Poole presided, and after-
wards there wa s an adjournment, to the Society of
Arts room, where Mrs. John Baker poured tea and
D'Auvergne Boxall’s pictures—each with its red seal
—were still on view.
Mrs. C. R. Morris, the Liberal Union’s feminine
president and one of the hardest workers for the
League of Nations and the National Council of
Women, has been nominated by the last-mentioned
as a delegate to the next Geneva Conference.
The staff undertook the programme at the Elder
Conservatorium’s last concert, with Hurlstone’s Sonata
for bassoon and piano by W. H. Foote and William
Silver as the performance of the evening. Hilda Gill,
Maude Puddy, Harold Wylde. Harold Parsons and
Charles Schilsky also lent a hand, and for the final
number Maude Puddy, William Silver and George
Pearce showed what three pairs of hands could do
on one piano with Percy Grainger’s “Zanzibar Boat
Song.” The show was one of the Con.’s best.

laughs in “Murty Brown” that the reader runs a risk of getting
what is known as the laughing face, the only known antidote for
same being to read a book of humor that is not Australian.

A barrel of rum was broached by Cap-
tain Woods and his merry men the
other night, and long tots and jazz were
served to all of Sydney’s Best who clambered
up the side of the just-about-to-depart Con-
cord. The cheerio was informal, but no end
of trouble had been taken oyer shutting the
night out from the deck with bunting and
palms and life-savers blazing with what the
girl opposite calls xylophone electrics, they’re
so noisy. The captain’s cabin, complete with
its Dutch stove and Ited Cross nurse —she
was of porcelain, and sat with brazenly dang-
ling legs upon the bookself—was turned
into a cloak-room for the ladies. The arrange-
ments were quite matey—you took off your
cloak and pitched it on the bunk. By the
time over a hundred, including the Governor's
lady and daughter Elaine, had done likewise
you couldn’t even waggle an eyelash without
the avalanche threatening to collapse and en-
gulf you.
Sir Dudley came to the party, and, water
being such a novelty to him, they had a play-
ing fountain close at hand to engage his
attention. Lady de Chair wore sable velvets
with a diamond or two flashing discreetly,
while Elaine looked like a Rhine maiden in
her sea-greens and pearly coruscations. Naval-
Commander Robins's wife wore the only
tiara on the quarter-deck, and daughter Vio-
let’s frock was of a blue so hard it shone
metallic through its lace filming. Chief Jus-
tice Knox’s lady swished black and silver, the
same handsome upholstery being borne by Mrs.
T. A. Spencer (Q.) and Mrs. Wilfrid Fairfax.
Barbara Bowker’s shining gold head was the
outstanding feature of sleek black frocking;
while Mrs. Vivers suggested a de luxe edition
in Italian blues and gold. Morna MacCor-
mick in her almond greens was one of the
belles of the evening, while Susan Spencer
looked as fresh as dew-splashed purple clover.
The Concord was not the first ship to rig
up a fountain as part of a scheme of dance-
decorations. When the Prince of Wales was
here H.M.A.S. Australia had a most attrac-
tive-looking fountain playing in the middle
of the waist-deck. New and ingenious
schemes for lighting, etc., during ships’ en-
tertainments are always being worked out,
but the old Australia’s upper-deck on that
occasion Avas quite the best rigged the oldest
mariners had ever seen. The Admiralty occa-
sionally has a brain-wave on the subject,
realising the value of board-ship dances
especially in foreign ports, and one official
treatise on the subject contained the follow-
ing instructive gem
Sitting-out Places:—Lamps in these places need
not be spaced as close together as is necessary else-
where ; also a lower candle-power is permissible, thus
serving two useful purposes—(a) decreasing the
load on the dynamo, (b) pleasing the guests. Colored
lamps of low candle-power hidden in green stuff
or flowers provide a good arrangement. Seat-actuated
switches are to be deprecated.
To which an energetic ward-room mess-secre-
tary with some experience replied: “We once
put one eight-candlepotver blue light in the
middle of our sitting-out places,, but it had
to be removed after the first interval, thus
decreasing the load on the dynamo and pleas-
ing both the officers and the guests.”
The cry of the suffering animal Avas evi-
dently heard by hundreds last Friday,
although at times the noise of the rain :m
the Palais roof nearly drowned the music
of the jazz. The roll-up Avas something in
the nature of a triumph of youth, for the
committee of this year’s R.S.P.C.A. dance
was of the young. Headed by the T. R.
Bavins’ deb. daughter Shirley, it had as
its secretary Commodore Wardle’s Jean, Avhile
Penelope Cay looked after the cash; and
the entire younger dancing set seemed intent
on peddling cigarettes and balloons. Elaine
de Chair, in almond green and a cordial
smile, came under Mrs. George Vh-ers’s wing
to present the prizes to the lucky balloon-
OAvners. The very cream of Sydney’s most
expensive Points floated on the dancing-floor;
and one of the most glittersome groups Avas
hostessed by Mrs. Tony Hordern. H.M.A.S.
Sydney’s Commander Bo.ves brought his fair-
haired wife, Avho is one of the season’s smart-
dressers : and president of the society Acocks
squired Mrs. Acocks to the hall of a thou-
sand lights.
Amelita Galli-Curci fluttered on to the
ToAvn Hall stage looking like a gold moth
to sing her farewells to Sydney. Gold lace,
gold tissue and gold tulle Avere the ingredients
of the souffle that swirled about the prima
donna’s tiny body. On her head she wore
a cross between a Greek Ikon head-dress,
and a Dolly Varden hat, composed of a gold
framework filled in back and front with
masses of silken roses. She also hung about
herself a few cables of pearls, a platinum
chain with a diamond the size of a glass
marble dangling thereon, and so many rings
that when she waved her kerchief in fare-
well she might have been mistaken for the
candelabra in the vestibule.
White and gold blossoms and dignified
arum-lilies trimmed old St. Stephen’s, in
I’hillip-street, for the wedding of Heather
Lilias McCrae Cramsie and Noel Cox-Taylor.
The pretty, dark-eyed bride is the only
daughter of the W. A. Cramsies, well known
these long years amid the Glen Innes sheep-
folds. The small bride was enveloped in a
lovely veil of old Honiton that nearly tipped
her toes, and was otherwise a shimmer of
white satin and orange blossom. The parson
was the Rev. John Edwards, of Rose Bay.
who had not only christened the bride but
married her parents. Bridesmaids Dell
Cox-Taylor, Margery Millingen and Beryl
McCrae —the last came from Glen Innes for
the eventful evening—glistened in apricot
satin and fluffy floating panels of georgette,
and carried great autumn bouquets. Best
man and groomsmen—all in the early years
of youth: it was a very young wedding—
were Charlie Johnson and the bride’s
brothers, Will and Roy. After the knot was
tied Mr. and Mrs. Cramsie welcomed an ava-
lanche of guests for supper and a dance in
Dungowan. Martin-place. In a long list of
toasts Brigadier-General Lloyd gave the
health of the ’groom’s parents-—Colonel and
Mrs. Cox-Taylor, of Victoria Barracks.
Poet Hugh McCrae’s daughter Huntley
chose St. Mark’s, at Darling Point, as her
jumping-off place into matrimony. Norman
Cowper, one or the junior partners of Allen,
Allen and Hemsley, w r as the man of the
moment, and took over liis best girl with the
air of one who is on a rising tide of six-and-
eightpences. No wedding-dress for Huntley
--she was cosily clad in an old-rose velour
two-piece made with its long coat effect open-
ing over golden marocains. .'Yellow fur made
the choker collar and cuffs. A hat all pinks
and golds topped the slim effect, and a
bouquet of old-fashioned sweetness came as
a sort of romantic afterthought. Margaret
Maearthur Onslow and bride’s sisters Rose
and Mardi ’mi.ided. Howard Lea gave the
blessing.
Something like the Aurora Borealis was
the burst of color that flushed the steps
to St. James’s during the passing of the
bride and bridesmaids of the Buckingham-
Watson nuptials. The bride, Doreen Wat-
son. is one of Summer Hill’s best-lookers,
and carried her ivory chiffon velvets with
an air only possible to slim litheness. Some-
thing of a frock this—a hint of the mediaeval
in its line and the deep fringe of seed-pearls.
Adding richness to richness came a splurge
of court-train fashioned of velvet and silver
lace and lined with silver lame. Three tall
’maids trailed clouds of glory in three differ-
ent shades of fuchsia velvet, and reflected
still more brightness from gold coronets.
The bridegroom was Ashley James Bucking-
ham. of the Oxford-street firm, and a citizen
of Stanmore. Padre Micklem recorded the
vows, and the Ambassadors housed the toasts
and a great flutter of guests.
This ij a Monte Luke picture of Mrs.
Harold Vale, one of the energetic secretaries
for next Mon-
day night’s ball
in aid of the T.
R. soldier and
sailor. Every
welfare organi-
sation in Syd-
ney is giving a
hand in the
fight against
the enemy in
our midst; and
this ball, org-
anised by the
Mayoress, has
attracted a
committee not
only of the
middle - aged
and the seri-
ous but also of
young enthu-
siasts such as
the lady along-
side. Mrs. Vale
is an active Feminist and a great, barracker
for the Outpost Kindergarten. When not en-
gaged in good works she sings and elocutes
with charm and talent.
There’s something heady about yellow
roses, and whatever goes to your head these
days goes to your feet, so the dancers at St.
Paul’s within the Uni., drunken at gaze of
the clumped yellow petals, made the dignified
corridors blink like a startled Rip Van
Winkle. Fireglow came through every open
doorway and flickered on every wall of the
happy-looking college, and there was as much
ioy in sitting-out as in listening-in. College-
Warden Garnsey did the honors, supported
by his lady, in frocking that tone-artist Roy
de Mestre might have described as a gavotte
in cream and gold.
Gwen Fuller, who will be married with
tremendous pomp and circumstance to Frank
\\ liarton betore this letter comes to life, has
been sustaining the usual round of congratu-
latory tea drinkings, many of them allied to
gift-givings worthy of consideration. While
her ex-Premier father has been busy changing
benches, Gwen has been busy trying on hats
and frocks, and the resulting trousseau is
said to be ravishing.

The blessed damozels of the Feminist Club
ran Toe 11. Clayton up to their lair in the
automatic the other night to explain the
Cause with a name like a germ. Rows and
rows of members listened, their noses shin-
ing with eagerness and the clean wash of
the rain above alternately glittersome even-
ing frocks ’and glittering macs. Ruby Rich,
her throat in a tuft of ermine, buzzed about
seeing that the broadcasting apparatus was
in full swing; and fellow-worker Padre
Hayes and his magnetic wife accompanied
the head-liner of the evening’s bill. Mrs.
Osborne England, in a Paquin model built
of moon-glowing blue georgette and sequins,
took half an hour off from the Buckingham-
Watson wedding to introduce Mr. Clayton.
This, the lady’s maiden speech, was one of
the best ever made in the club. Then she
darted away to her revels in the Ambassa-
dors ; and the nice rotund Reverend, who
looks like Chesterton’s Father Brown, ex-
plained his mission not only to the Feminists
but to every listener-in over the continent.

Bertie Kelly beckoned Society into Beale’s
concert-room on one of last week’s wet warm
nights to have its horizon extended by
Dvorak and Brahms. Some of the expen-
sively lip-sticked evidently need a bit of
musical nutriment, for the Philistine in their
midst w r as delighted to hear a row of the
befurred burst into applause at the wrong
moments —just like a good old plebeian Town
Hall audience. Bertie Kelly, wearing a
fevered brow and a viola, gave all-comers
the freedom of the really comfortable chairs,
and specially placed Town-Clerk Layton
with a view to training him in the way the
new Town Hall chairs should go. In addi-
tion to the two quartettes of the evening,
Trixie Tange poured all the temperament
that vibrates below her red-gold curly thatch
into two Brahms rhapsodies. Trix. who
makes for Vienna with mother in August,
threatens to be one of the cleverest pianists
the State has produced. Nancy Marsden
pleased the eye in a Godard and a Rimsky-
Korsakoff offering, and suffered a recall with
charm, the accompaniments being supplied
by the clever fingers of Margaret Chalmers.
The Timothy Coghlan couple, the Chief Jus-
tice Streets and the Kelso Kings were not-
ables in the gathering, not to mention two
proud mothers, Mrs. Marsden and Mrs.
Tange.
The Y.W.C.A. got a hustle on the other
day and invited the G.-G.’s lady to lav the
foundation-stone of its new home. Which
she did amid gusts of rain and prayerful
chanting and a flood of words from a plat-
form ornamented by those who fill their days
with good works. The State Governor’s
lady and Mayoress Cecilia Walsh were front-
rankers, and smiled over presentation bou-
quets colorful but not gaudy. Two of the
largest cheques dronned into the building
fund were one for £3OO from Mrs. Newman
and another for £lOOO from ,T. O. Fairfax.
On the Wentworth the flying people settled
like a horde of locusts last Friday night:
and between the 700 pairs of feet there was
scarcely a blade of dancing-space left for the
most intrepid. Four model aeroplanes spread
aloft gave character to the function, which
was the yearly revel of the A.F.C. Well-
known names in Australia’s flying history
were heard on every side, and these men of
the air seemed, like Mercury, t 6 hate winged
feet —most of them danced, even in the most
congested corners, like angels.
The All Blacks and Sydney amphibians
met at the Wentworth for a jollo on Monday
night, and even the hypercritical could not
have called it a dry affair. Feeling some-
thing like the children of Noah while the
floodwaters seeped and gurgled and dismally
splashed, the revellers made merry, knowing
that they at least were under cover. The
ball in honor of the fern-leaf chieftains was
an enormous and comprehensive success—it
netted in even that lady of rare appearances,
Dame Mary Hughes. The Henry Braddons
were among the first to grasp the visitors’
hands. The lady, who was president of the
ball committee,* was in mouse-grey velvets
under a Dutch blue velvet cloak.
Tall, bronzed and bearded is Professor

An interesting woman, “lithe as a panther”
as the novelist would say, is Mrs. MacCul-
locli, a visitor from India, who with her
colonel husband is putting up at the Aus-

big-game shooting, and she has bagged more
tigers and lions than would stock a first-class
zoo. When she is not playing puss-in-the-
corner with the queen of the jungle she is
snake-cliarming or playing bridge.
Ivambala Old Girls are going to make
their ball at the Palais on July 17 a record
gathering. Last year Ivambala became a
Church of England school, and now its en-
thusiasts are eager to reduce the mortgage
on the premises. The Roseby sisters are
very popular school-marms; and Society in
large numbers, not to speak of Lord and
Lady Forster and the State Exes., will throw
the light, of its presence on the gathering.
Wet weather and other things in Brisbane:
The Digger Engineers had their reunion dinner
in the Hotel Daniell, and set a knife and fork for
His Ex. A hollow square was formed for the
purpose of attacking the eatables. Tall pedestals,
topped by poinsettia in baskets, were placed at the
corners, and the square was outlined in rose-colored
chains of lights, and had for centre-piece symbol;
of the profession.
Wilkie Stoops to Conquer at the Royal, where the
old English comedy is having some extra nights at
the instigation of the box office. Then come revivals
of “The Bells” and “The Rivals.” . '
The young folk danced at Government House in a
decking of poinsettia and Iceland poppies. Captain
Turner and Captain Saunders held up Sir Matthew’s
hands. Mrs. Leonard Turner wore blade satin crepe,
Mrs. E. K. 'fully primrose brocade, Mrs. Arthur
Clark mauve, and Mrs. John Flower —the other day
she was Elizabeth Dods, of Sydney—was in French
grey marocain with grey fur.
In the afternoon his Ex., with a large party, went
to get his honorary degree at the Exhibition Hall in
connection with Comem. day at the Uni. At night
the Students’ Union dinner at the Uni. was served
in the main hall and the dons put on their best
bibs and threw off their gravity. At the Ritz the
sweet girl grads, had their party in a setting of
blue and gold, Freda Bage presiding.
Phoebe Kinvan’s husband has been taking pictures
of the Blind, Deaf and Dumb children at work and
at play, contrasting them with normal youngsters,

The film was shown in the Melba Theatre and washed
down with the usual souchong afterwards at the
Women’s Club, where Mrs. Kirwan lifted the cosy
for a host of the interested.
In pouring rain some 250 people jazzed to the
greater glory of Gertrude Concannon at the Belle-
vue. Mrs. Ryan and Mrs. D. J. O’Mara arranged the

Mrs. M. Forrest gave a party at the Carlton for
the Allan Wilkies in a setting of rose-red gerberas.
Amongst the lunchers were the Readings, C. V.

Barbara Sisley gathered her Eisteddfod winners
together for a recital in the Elite. Amongst her
successful pupils are Leo Guyatt and Feo Todd

maiden.
Constance Archer, daughter of the E. YV. Archers
of Archer station, took Ernest Murray, of Killeen,

of guests in overshoes and mackintosh.
Cup day at Albion Park, was an umbrella parade
too. The president and committee gave a tea on

SPORTINO
NOTIONS
There were yells of disgust at Caulfield
on Saturday when, with half a mile to go, Gay
Serenader (12’s), who had failed dismally at Williams-
town, jumped his way to the front in the Toolambool
Hurdle and set up a good lead. At the turn the
Land of Sohg gelding was lengths clear of the field.
But Eric the Red (7’s) moved up fast, took the
last hurdle more cleanly than the leader, and beat
him for pace on the flat. Eric was a length ahead
at the box, with the favorite Ileke (3’s), who
finished well, half a length further back. Whelan's
four from South Oss—Fiscom, Sir Myram, Thomond
and Mountain Lion —ran respectably, and Rahda and
Berrinbo also impressed, particularly Rahda, who
carried 171 b. more than his National weight, list.
Barring accidents, however, it is difficult to see
any of these turning the tables on Eric the Red
in the big affair at Flemington on July 4. So far
Jackstaff’s brother has done all that was required
of him, and has shown undeniable staying qualities ;
moreover; he will carry a mere 9st. 2lb. as against
lOst. 41b. on Saturday. He meets all his Caulfield
antagonists, except Rahda and Mountain Lion, on
better terms. The remarkable run put in by Repatri-
ation (16’s) was a feature of the Wanda Steeple-
chase. Commencing the second of the two miles he
was about 20 lengths behind Flagon (6’s), but he
gained so persistently at and between fences that
when they turned towards the judge he looked a
likely winner. However, his great effort told on him,
and Flagon beat him by two or three lengths. Web-
ster was aboard Flagon, as he was when the
Maltster —Ardea gelding won at Mordialloc three
days before. Flagon, who is related to Eurythmic
on the dam’s side, is not in the G. N. Steeple, and
St. Roseland (5 to 2) did not add to the number
of his supporters for that race by finishing a poor
sixth. Old Llanthony (6’s), who has earned his
oats since he left N. S. Wales, got a break on his
field in the Richmond Cup, 11 furlongs, and was
never caught. Then Billy Duncan, who has a great
following these days, got home on Smoke Bomb
(10’s) in the Cambria Welter, and Sailing Home
(6 to 2) in the Rosny Plate. Sailing Home, a
successful visitor to Sydney at Easter, is trained for
Norman Falkiner by Jack Holt. His was a meri-
torious performance, for the English horse was badly
placed "for a time, but the three-year-old Swoop
(10’s), a very likely-looking bit of stuff, would have
caught him in another 20 yards.
* * * *
“Adelaide”; The foolish (and untidy)
habit of tearing up and scattering totalisator tickets
as soon as they seem to be unsuccessful received a
severe check at Adelaide Birthday Cup meeting. In
the last race cn the final day, Blabung ran second,
and the dividend on him was calculated and posted,
awaiting the Pay Out signal; in a few cases people
who wanted to get home sold their tickets at a
small loss rather than wait to collect. Bright Poppy
was third, and the tote pays only first and second. The
usual tearing up and scattering of Bright Poppy tickets
had been going on, when Blabung was found to be
nowhere near the right weight (the trainer had
omitted a lead-bag), and was wiped out. Bright
Poppy tickets, of which 984 had been issued, sud-
denly became worth £1 6s. each. There was a
keen search for strewn pieces by the rightful owners
(and others) in the dusk, then by lantern light,
and early next morning. Holders who had left the
course and learned the good news only from the
newspaper had no chance; their excitement came in
retrieving any tickets they had carried home and
consigned to the w.p.b. or given to the baby to
play with. The Adelaide Racing Club office was
besieged all the week by holders of fragments-—in
one case, 16 bits of a single ticket. The amount
outstanding was £1174, very few tickets having
been cashed at the course. The Government will
eventually get anything unclaimed.
* * * *
“Cob” ; Legalise, who won a race in Sydney
recently and may repeat the performance before
long, will be 12 in August. Some people reckon
him the oldest stallion now. racing in Australia. It
may be so, but when Raheny ran third to Cobram
and Booligal in the 1918 Y.R.C. G. N. Steeple, that
little entire was nearly 18. And bed won both in
Victoria and Tasmania that season. Originally a
sprinter, Raheny ran third in the 1907 Hobart
Cup. Hurdling followed, and then ’chasing. Only
a 14.3 pony, he was so clever and game that he
never came down during his ten seasons over the
jumps. Then one day he pulled up with a broken
fetlock, and a vet. had to put him out of his
misery. Raheny failed to get a single foal when
put to the stud in his prime; otherwise he would
not have been a ’chaser.
* * ■* *
“FY7”: Light was thrown in a Sydney
court the other day on a highly popular method of
catching mugs, and not the ordinary plain and
colored s.p. robbery either. The odds laid are known
to the punter beforehand, and he cannot be rooked
by the useful limit “proviso,” which he usually
doesn’t hear of till he has won a long shot. Whether
the odds offered, 120 to 1, fairly represent the
chances against a win for the punter is another
story. Briefly, the backer essays to pick six placed
horses in the first six races of a programme, one
horse ill each race. The layer bets him £6 to Is.
that it can’t be done. The Sydney defendant owned
up to weekly takings averaging £2OO, and paid
a £lOO fine without a squeak.

“Pardon me, but could you tell me what is the name of this — ah —
golf course?”
“As far as I’m concerned they're the missing links!”
“Nitric”: An affecting incident occurred
after a race at a recent West Queensland meeting,
the bookies asking the band to play “The Dead
March.” They surrounded the musicians and re-
mained bareheaded during the dirge. Then they
joined dolorously in the chorus of “Horsey, Keep
Your Tail Up,” which the band played on its own
initiative in the hope of cheering the downcast
Tommies up.
Australia is represented at Wimbledon,
which tournament is now raging, by J. O. Anderson,
Mrs. Harper, Esna Boyd, Daphne Akhurst and Mr.
and Mrs. Utz. Utz failed in the first round, but
one of the ladies-—-Mrs. Harper, it is thought, in
England—ought to reach the semi-finals, though
none of them is likely to trouble the incomparable
Suzanne. Anderson’s path to a Wimbledon cham-
pionship has been rendered smoother than it other-
wise would be by the absence of Tilden, Bill Johnston
and Richards. His most formidable opponent is
expected to be the 'French youngster Lacoste.
Anderson’s preliminary work at the nets has not
pleased some of the critics, but he himself is satis-
fied, and he ought to be the best judge. If he
can’t lick the lot opposed to him there is little
hope for Australia in the Davis Cup contests.
“H. Hardupp” : A domestic drudge got a
bit of his own back at the opening of a feminine
sports club in a Melbourne suburb. A prime mover
in the affair was Mrs. Allroundah, who is a dab at
golf, has won swimming races and tennis tourna-
ments, and is a good partner and dreaded opponent
at other games, from ping-pong to bridge. The
skirted clubbers brought their menfolk along, and
the weary-looking housefather Mrs. Allroundah had in
tow was introduced as Mr. Allroundah. “So glad
to meet you, Mr. Allroundah! ” said one of the ladies
»n the large group into which he was suddenly dragged.
“We all know' your dear Wife, of course. There
doesn’t seem to be a game she does not play. Bui
what is your game?” “Minding the baby!” was
the victim’s reply.
The argument between Ben Martin (9st.
41b.) and Jamito (9:;t. 91b.) at the Melbourne
Stadium was so disappointing that, when it was
all over, one of the crowd remarked bitterly:
"They both started level, and each finished behind.”
Martin should have won, but his tactics were stupid.
As Jamito, growing old and fat, leaned his head on
Martin’s bosom, the Australian seemed uncertain
whether to cuff him or burst into tears. Benjamin’s
spasmodic efforts to rock the encumbrance to sleep
failed. Had he tried uppercutting it might have
been different; but after the stipulated 12 rounds
the affectionate display was declared a draw. The
bill was completed by Charlie Pilkington, of America
(9M. 101 b.), and Bert McCarthy (9st. 81b.) fighting
a civil 10 rounds which the local lad won on points.
Pilkington displayed a tendency to hit low, which
brought two claims for fouls; the referee, however,
dccl in id to award the poultry. In the seventh,
Pilkington shammed grogginess, but he is a poor
actor, and the old ruse failed to draw McCarthy
in. Bert is as cautious as any member of Parliament.
*■*■**
“Tren”: Reported that the M.G.Cj is
inviting Hubert Ashton to return from Burma and
captain England in next year's Tests. Ashton, a
Cambridge triple blue, has just turned 27. He
won the M.C. in France, made the first century
against Armstrong’s team in 1921, and his fielding was
a factor in the first defeat of the same side at
Eastbourne. In eight innings against, the Australians
lie averaged 59.5, and that year he was the only
batsman who played Gregory and McDonald con-
fidently and well. In the field he is keen and daring,
quite the equal of Chapman at . mid-off or slip, and
at short leg without a peer. At Cambridge he
was a great captain ; he led his side to an innings
victory in two consecutive years, helping with 118
in the first season and 90 n.o. in the seem 1. His
brothers, C. T. and G. Ashton, also captained
Cambridge, a record that equals that of the
Studds.
* * * *
“Nitric” : To hole out in one is occasion-
ally done on Australian links, but generally by a
mashie shot in a short hole. At Yerongpilly links
i Brisbane), Dick Carr holed out a 252 yards drive at
the sixteenth. To any-
one knowing the
course the merit of the
achievement is evi-
dent, since the area of
the fairway where the
ball must be pitched
slopes away and only a
shot with perfect direc-
tion will run straight
for the pin. Making all
due allowance for the
element of luck, the
shot was a master-
piece, and young Carr,
who is assistant . to
Stafford, the pro., is
likely to go far in the
game. His mettle will
presently be tested on
Yerongpilly by Soutar.
Carnegie Clark and
Howard. It was Car-
negie Clark who de-
signed the links.

“Happy” Eyre,
foremost among the 16
Victorian golf pros,
who qualified for the
big professional tourna-
ment next month, was
christened Francis Pat-
rick, but inherited his
nickname from his

Eyre” who kept the
beach at Manly secure
for many years. Whilst

ish surfers who had
been caught in the
undertow “H app y '
junior caddied at the
Manly links, where he
showed class in a golf-
boys’ competition. He
is 26 now;, and has been a professional for three
years, having broken away from an insurance office
to return to the game. Young “Happy” is a
real all-rounder, having represented N.S.W. against
M.L. at Rugby Union football, won swimming races
and been a power in the Manly Life-saving Club.
* * * *
The visiting All Blacks were unexpectedly
checked in their second game on the Sydney Agricul-
tural Ground, “a” N.S.W. side beating them 18—-16.
The selectors included some country players, one of
them being Morrissey, the big St. Joseph’s centre,
who is now result nt in the Newcastle district.
Another Newcastle preduct in Snell was tried at
scrum half and proved a great success. Reid, of
Glebe-Balmain, was the other centre, and this time
no one could cavil at the defence. All the new
hands, including Laycock, a Walcha forward, did so
well that they were selected to play in the second
Test on Saturday. In spite of bad weather, there
was another crowd of 15,000, and after a close and
exciting game Maoriland won by 4—o, a dropped
goal by Harris, the All Black full-back, being the
only score. Morrissey and Reid again justified their
promotion, and little Snell, behind the scrum, tossed
the ball out in good style. His weakness was a
tendency to short punts which, time and again,
gave the All Black insides possession. Ross, at
full-back, was admirable in every way, while George
was clever at five-eighth. The absence of Grossman,
the scoring winger, was felt by the home side, though
Norman Smith, of Manly, tackled well. Elvey, the
crack M.L. winger was also an absentee, and Law,
his substitute, failed to impress. L. Johnston, at
five-eighth, was again the star of the M.L. centre-
backs, neither Blake nor Matson rising to his level;
and the pack was admirable, with Donald doing
great work as wing-forward. Along with Finlayson
and Knight, another typical M.L. follower, he made
things lively for the Blue backs. Harris, at full,
improved on his first day’s display, and the goal
which won his side the game was the result of a
tool and clever bit of work.
University, previously defeated in four of
its five matches, provided the surprise in Sydney
Kugby League football on Saturday by downing
North Sydney, 15 points to 11. North hadn t lost
a game. Each side got three tries, but O’Rourke's
three goals made the difference. North lost the
services of Murphy, who has been in the wars lately,
but was a beaten team when the winger had to
leave the field. Balmain’s big win over Ulebe (15
to nil) was due largely to Ferguson’s clever hooking,
an art in which N.S.W. has been weak since Sandy
Pearce hung up the jersey. St. George, which has
acquired a speedy back in the .South Sea Islander
Slockie, beat Eastern Suburbs by 5 to nil ; and
Newtown overcame Western Suburbs by 13 to 10 —
its first success. South Sydney now looks to have
a mortgage on the premiership.
The English Soccer footballers took wot
weather to Queensland with them, playing both their
games last week on sloppy grounds. The first match,
against a Brisbane team, was won easily, 6—o;
an 1 Queensland suffered a dreadful licking, 11 —0.
In spite of bad conditions, attendances have been
good, and the Britons have more than satisfied their
audiences; m Saturday’s game Batten, their stocky
centre, kicked six goals. The first Test will
be played at Brisbane on Saturday, and Aus-
tralia’s chances do not seem rosy. Masters, our best
centre forward, will be absent, and the team, which
includes no less than eight N. S. Welshmen, will
surprise everyone if it seriously threatens the visitors’
combination. Murray, the Queensland left half, will
captain the Australians.
In cold, foggy weather 25,000 enthusiasts
visited flic Fitzroy ground and -watched the pride of
Geelong demolish the local XVIII. ’Ro.v lias lately
been getting licked more than it cares fur. and in
the effort to correct matters it put more energy
than science into its play, so the game was very will-
ing. At the end the Maroons found themselves
12 points short-—7 goals 15 behinds to Geelong’s
9 goals 15 behinds. The improving Carlton put up
a great fight against Collingwood and failed glori-
ously—’Wood, 78 points; Carlton, 64. The Rich-
mond Tigers, with but 2'} games in the bag. reckoned,
on their own ground, to make cold meat of Footscray
and would have done so had their forwards been
reasonably accurate. But their score of 9 goals
21 behinds to ’Scray’s 12 goals 9 behinds left them
6 points behind, and their name is henceforth Mud
unless they do something desperate in the next few
Saturdays. The North Melbourne-St. Hilda scuffle
was fierce, and the Saints were somewhat lucky to
get home with 68 points to North’s 63. Melbourne
pulverised South Melbourne, with 100 points to
54; and Essendon walloped Hawthorn much as a
Scotchman jokes, 7 4 points to Hawthorn’s 61 being
the measure of the victory.
“H. Hardupp”: Footscray attributes its reverses
this season to the absence of Eason, Ford and O’Brien,
who were the team’s stars when it prevailed in the
Association competition and vanquished Essendon last
year. The agitation for the removal of the outlawry
which fell upon the trio when they left the League
to play with the Association has become almost a
political matter. In a desperate attempt to melt
the League’s hard heart, a parson was included in a
deputation which asked for clemency. The rev. sport
preached from the text: “Is it not possible for man
to live down wrong?” but the governing body re-
mained adamant. It is quite on the cards that the
Prince of Wales will now be entreated to intercede
for the disqualified leather-chasers. The thing has
been suggested in all seriousness—and Melbourne
takes its football dashed seriously.
“Trekle” : Melbourne’s most incomprehensible team
is St. Hilda. Year after year the Saints are com-
posed of capable ’bailers, with a sprinkling of real
stars, yet they seldom gain a place in the first
four. Theirs is the only original team that has
never won a premiership. In 1913 their side was
good enough for anything, but after a splendid
beating of Fitzroy in the final it went down like
medium beers on a summer’s day to the same team
in the “grand” final. This year Saints are as uncer-
tain as ever. Melbourne beat them by eight goals,
and Geelong by six ; on the other hand, they walloped
Hawthorn by eight goals, walked over the unde-
feated Essendon by five, and petrified Collingwood by
six.

The first round, of seven matches, in Adel
aide club football left an unusually interesting
position, Norwood, which at first seemed unbeatable,
having lately gone down twice. It is still ahead,
however, Sturt, West Torrens, Port and West Adel-
aide having each lost three times. The value of
teamwork is seen in the fact that South Adelaide,
though owning A. J. Ryan, easily the leading goal-
kicker for the season, is only sixth on the club
I’.t.
* * * *
Frank Golding, who learned his football
in Jarrahland —he played with West Perth before
the war—is skippering the South Australians now
visiting Perth to play a series of matches with the
Westralians. The first game, at Subiaco, drew a
£997 “gate.” The Croweaters had a 19-point lead
at half-time, but the Gropers steadily reduced the
gap, and during the last quarter the advantage
veered round to their side for the first time. With
three minutes to go they were six points ahead.
Then Bent, the S. Aus. forward, came to light with
a clever goal, and when the bell rang the visitors
were 8 goals 9 behinds to Westralia’s 7 goals 12
behinds. A great game with a thrilling finish.
“Holland-street”: Jamestown (S.A.) has
a football club which is running fifth in the compe-
tition for the district premiership. There are five
clubs engaged. The positions were given in the
sporting section of the Adelaide Advertiser, and in
the Sits. Vacant column this ad. appeared:—
'“Wanted Butcher, must be able kill; board and
lodgings provided. Apply, with reference, and state
wages required to Secretary, Jamestown Football
Club (footballer preferred).”
Thus' far no casualties have been reported by any
of the other four clubs, Gladstone, Laura, George-
town or Crystal Brook.
THE BARRACKER BOLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The [Victorian Football] League tribunal
sharply warned G. Shorten not to hit at barrackers
again, whatever they might call him.” — Melb. Sun.
Hark to the barracker; come, gather near him ;
Pat the brave back of him; cheer him and beer him.
Hail the stern might of him; praise the mere sight
of him,
Loud your delight of him! Hear him; oh, hear him!
“There’s me an’ Mick an’ Jimmy Blorc,
P’raps ten of us, all told ;
And only twenty thousand more
(That’s all the ground ’ll ’old);
An’ nothin’ but a four-foot fence
Between us an’ that bloke immense.
“But me, I’m not the sort, y’ see,
That anyone can bluff,
An’ when they start a row with me
They soon find out I’m tough.
I don’t go beatin’ ’round the bush ;
I speaks me mind—when with the push.
“Of course, there’s umpires watchin’, too,
An’ ten or twelve John ’Ops;
But when it comes to savin’ you
They’re pretty slow, the cops.
But still (you all know that I’m game)
I talks to that big cow by name.
“So, when ’e goes up for a mark
An’ someone slings ’im fine,
It’s ‘Serve yer right, yer crimson nark I’
I says. ‘Yes, you .... yer swine !’
Then on the pickets ’e gets ’ung;
“Ooray,’ I says, ‘yer dirty mong!’
“They jamb a knee into ’is chest
An’ tread upon ’is ear;
An elbow bends ’is ribs the best
I’ve ’eard all through the year.
They trample on ’is face, the skunk;
‘Get up,’ I says, ‘yer lousy funk!’
“An’ then ’e takes a swipe at me,
The cowardly, big stiff ;
But I’m not scared o’ such as ’e;
In less than ’alt' a jiff
1 dodge be’ind some nice fat swell,
An’ then—just don’t I give ’im Hell!”
Thus the brute barracker; nothing may match him.
Though brutal players might hurt, could they catch
him,
Safely he peers at them; boldly he sneers at them,
Gibbers and jeers at them.... Devil despatch him!

Never beaten in Reliability
in five years of actual TESTS
EOPLE everywhere are talking about the beauty of the fine new
Willys-Knight—of its great performance—of its remarkable new
price.
In five years of actual tests under auspices of the Royal Automobile Club of Australia, Willys-
Knight has registered full points for reliability in every contest entered.
Besides having the inherent advantages of actually improving with use, Willys-Knight is the only
American car that is equipped with the famous Lanchester Balancer. This famous invention
gives Willys-Knight complete freedom from vibration at all engine speeds.
It is a common thing for Willys-Knight owners to drive 50,000 miles and more without spending
a shilling for engine repairs.
Call in and inspect the fine new Willys-Knight with an engine you’ll never wear out-
with LANCHESTER HARMONIC BALANCER.

THE INKY WAY.
Harry Clark, just dead in Melbourne, aged 74, was
for nearly 50 years with the Age, and for 25
years was the paper’s chief printer, retiring six
years ago. He came from Nottingham.
Australian sporting circles mourn the death, at
45, of Hadrian Moody, sporting editor of Adelaide
Register for 20 years. His pen-name was “Mostyn."
Clarence Moody, of the Sydney Sun, is an elder
brother.
“Widgee”: When Melbourne’s Evening Sun ceased
to shine, the displaced newspapermen who couldn't
find jobs were formed into a little staff under chief
Harry Boulter. The idea was to give them a daily
allowance of work for the Herald until they could
secure other employment. It is rather a dismal
coincidence that most of the work on which they have
since been engaged is—obituaries.
“Pedro”: The aspiration of “Bill o’ Costs” (B.
28/5/’25) for someone to arise and talk back at
the jury-lecturing Judge has been at least partly
satisfied. Long ago, when the Bench knew the court
reporters perhaps better than it knows them now, a
Victorian Judge instructed an usher to tell one of
them that “he didn’t think much of his report
of yesterday’s judgment.” “Well, you can tell his
Honor,” said the reporter to the shocked myrmidon,
“that I think dam’ little of his judgment.”
, “Yea” :An interesting war relic was lost to London
when the Nizam Gazette, of which I was the editor,
went out of action at the Dardanelles in ’l4. We
used to write it on scraps of paper and paste it up
with jam for gum, on the four sides of a massive
wooden post which held up the deck of the troop-
ship. One morning, just as I had finished cleaning
the medium of publication for a fresh volume, the
skipper came down, with a gang of men, prepared to
saw out the post and send it to London as a relic
of the landing. He seemed genuinely' sorry that it
had been cleaned. And the Turks cut short the
second volume.
“Ibn El Issar”: Seeing that the Australian pro-
vincial press conference is to be held in Brisbane
early in July, I respectfully suggest that the agenda
papei - should contain some suggestions for improving
the standard of ordinary courtesy in some of the
provincial staffs, as well as a lecturette on the law
of meum et tuum. Some time ago I answered three
advertisements from country newspapers in need of
a journalist. With each application went a sheaf of
typewritten copies of testimonials, for making which
1 paid good brass to a typing agency, and stamps
for the return of these last. The applications have
not even been acknowledged, the papers have not been
returned, and the blanky stamps have been pinched.
“Simon” : Mudgee, the middle-western N. S. Wales
town, is much reduced in a newspaper sense. Of
three bi-weeklies which flourished a while ago, but
one remains. The old Western Post, which recently
went out of action, had pro bono publico-ed for 50
years. The present Guardian is a resurrection of
the Mudgee Independent, the paper the erratically
brilliant “Mudgee” Taylor used to edit. Twenty-five
years ago Ted Richards, a part proprietor, commenced
a three-Parliament “spell” in Macquarie-street. To
get there he fought three of the closest contests on
record. Once he beat Bob Jones by six votes; on
another occasion he outed the late John Haynes,
another Inky Wayfarer, by nine.
Adelaide’s only afternoon paper, the News, has had
to stand trial for “printing an advertisement about
an illegal lottery.” It was admitted that the
affair was one in N.S.W., purporting to be authorised
by that State’s Attorney-General. The argument took
three turns; (l) All lotteries are illegal by S.A.
law 7 , and that settles it. (2) But S.A. law' cant
possibly make a lottery in N.S.W. illegal, so this
one wasn’t. (3 —from the Bench) “There is no proof
that it was legal even in N.S.W.; and, anyway, the
Act must be taken to mean a lottery which would
be illegal if held in S.A. Call it 10 bob, and £1
costs.” The Mail’s lawyer mentioned, incidentally,
that the contract for the ad. had been made with a
condition that “if any trouble arises” it would be
promptly stopped ; also that the paper had asked
both Attorney-General and Crow'n Solicitor for an
opinion in advance, but they had declined to say
whether publishing it w’ould be safe or not.
“Harora”; Francis McCullagh, one of the journal-
ists accompanying the American fleet, is an Irishman
with some notable scoops to his credit. He was on
a small steamer lying in Port Arthur the night
when, without any formal declaration of war, the
Japanese fleet attacked the Russian war vessels anchored
there. The vessel on which McCullagh was a guest
left hurriedly for Chefoo, where the lucky journalist
roused the sleepy clerk in the telegraph office and
sent a despatch to the New York Herald that
startled the w'orld. After acting as a correspondent
in the early stages of the great war, McCullagh
served as a captain with General Knox’s British
forces in Siberia; when those troops were with-
drawn eastwards he moved west, and, visiting
Ekaterinburg, was enabled to give the first authentic
news regarding the murder of Czar Nicholas and his
family. Subsequently McCullagh went to Moscow and
returned to London with some red-hot copy about
Bolshevik doings.
What R. S. Ross thinks about it: “H.J.T.”
(B. 28/5/’25) says “the rage for newspaper
publicity amazes every journalist.” The “amaze-
ment” has never startled my listening-in.
Indeed, journalists like to see themselves in print
as much as others of the fool public, if one may
accept the evidence of their official organ. “Don’t
leave my name out,” said the Owe Sullivan and
spoke for the lot. Hence the Journalist. And
for a good reason. It pays to advertise. “Nothing
except the Mint will make money without advertis-
ing” is a saying credited to Gladstone. Journalism,
like Democracy, pivots upon publicity. In either
sphere you have to be advertised to be appreciated.
To be successful as politician, preacher, professor,
physician or play-actor, publicity is a sine qua non.
Whether you would win a selection ballot or a wai,
the way to win is—advertise! Is it any wonder thal
the piercing passion for publicity is fleet-footeu.
many-sided, honeycombing, subterranean, anything
and everything? Publicity simply has to be got
to get the jebs. Nor, taking higher ground, is
Fame itself heedless of publicity’s feet. Authorship,
invention, exploration, music, art are dependent upon
advertisement though Genius throb in each; but
where there is no genius, publicity alone makes full
atonement and brings grist to the mill. In a world
where most things are merchandise and marketable,
it pays to advertise. Publicity is the price we pay
for modernity.
THE DREAMER.

I have been a dreamer always; and my dreaming
feet still tread
All the alleys and the small ways where the
dreamer’s feet are led.
But in every' fleeting vision that my roving fancies
bring
Springs a hope of things elysian ; whilst a rhyming
whispering
Tells to me in accents tender:
“You may dream; but you must render
Unto Ciesar what is Caesar’s and to God....the
other thing.”
Poesy is aye enduring; but the lotus leaves must
fall—
You must leave behind alluring things to get the
wherewithal
To render to the butcher, and the coalman—here’s
the sting—
What is due them. On your soul, man, you must
give your dreams the fling
And render unto Caesar
(Take it easy, Ebenezer) —

10 Seconds Stropping
Equals 1 New Blade
THE stropping device of the * VALET Razor is part and
parcel of the razor itself. You slip the strop under the blade
as it lies in the razor, run the razor up and down, and in
ten seconds you have a blade which is as good as new.
And such a blade! Keen as a lancet when it first comes out of
its wrapper, equally keen for weeks and months of shaving-
kept keen by means of its own simple self-stropping device.
The “VALET” is the one and only safety razor that never has
to be unscrewed either for stropping or cleaning, and that gives
a new edge to its blade every day for 50 or 60 days.
Any dealer will show you the “VALET’S” simple working plan.

immense and world-famous group of artists who have

So faithful, so startlingly identical with the original
are Edison’s Re-Creations of Middleton’s voice that

Owing to their strange liabit of releasing
new attractions in squads or droves instead
of singly, the noble band of Sydney’s amusers
had no fresh chop suey from overseas to offer
on Saturday night. This Page was, never-
theless, prepared to sacrifice its evening in a
righteous cause if it could have found one
entertainment, however insignificant, that
was in origin and inspiration entirely Aus-
tralian. Amongst the crowded Jungle of
attractions, however, it was quita/unable to
discover anything that exclusively exuded a
smell of eucalyptus. There was a boxing
match that was half Australian, the other
moiety being Filipino, and there were two
Australian singers who claimed the attention
of Australian audiences because they had
just come back from training ior concert suc-
cesses in the Old World. The rest of the
night’s corroboree was mainly Americano.
This would suggest that the United States
was the artistic centre of the globe if a
perusal of the sort of stuff N’Yoick went to
see in a recent month did not flatly contra-
dict the implication. G. B. Shaw’s “Caesar
and Cleopatra,” Restoration-dramatist Con-
greve’s “Love for Love,” Beyerlein’s “Zapfen-
streich” and a drayload of dramas from
Budapest made up much of the curriculum
and suggest that what this country is largely
fed on won’t stay on the stomach of the
country that produces it.

Paul Althouse and Arthur Middleton re-
newed acquaintance with Sydney audiences
on Saturday at the Town Hall after three
years’ absence. Their team-work was found
to dovetail as smoothly and brilliantly as of
old. Perhaps the outstanding example of
this was the duet between Mepho and Faust
in the thyroid-gland episode; and their sing-
ing of “Be Mine the Delight” was as full
" BLACK-HAND GEORGE" AT SYDNEY
TIVOLI
Black-hand George (Wee Georgic Wood),
captain of the secret gang, refuses to
divulge secrets to his mother (Dolly
Harmer).
of character and imagery as ever. Althouse,
the tenor, suffering perhaps from weather in
the throat, was not as lyric as he can be till
the end of his first group, when Levade’s
“The Elopement” charmed both the ear and
the fancy; and the good impression was in-
tensified by Ivor Novello’s “Page’s Road
Song,” a triumph of sincerity. Gounod’s
“Lend Me Your Aid” was another of the
tenor’s successes. Arthur Middleton, mel-
lowly plump as his own voice, is a singer
who walks on to the stage as unaffectedly as
though he were coming forward to announce
that “the flashlight is about to be taken.”
His is a singing bass that can pour as
allure into a love-song as any tenor. “Syl-
via” and “Drink to Me Only with Thine
Eyes” were as devastating as a high-voltage
nightingale, a discreet moon and a little
night-wind blown through a flowering hedge.
Mr. Middleton wouldn’t dare sing songs of
sentiment r in such fashion in the Land of
Prohibitions —the Purity Brigade would be
after him. The length, depth and altogether
amazing dimensions of this singer’s tone were
heard in his opening number, Flegier’s “The
Horn,” and his versatility, his humor and
his sense of drama were expressed in Mouse
sorgsky’s “Song of the Flea,” the “Figaro - ’
aria and the spine-melting “Danny Deever.”
Further concerts are booked for to-night
(Thursday) and Saturday and next week.
At Sydney Majesty's on Monday Josie
Melville will begin to re-endear herself to
theatregoers as “Sally” for three nights and
a matinee only.
Frank Harvey bought and paid for Muriel
Starr for the last time on Wednesday after-
noon, and Sydney Criterion goes into the
hands of the ordinary charlady until Satur-
day night, when Pauline Frederick starts
“Spring Cleaning” on her own account.
Loud hakas of applause are resounding
at the Lyceum Theatre, Sydney, where
Princess Rangiriri and her nine wahines are
purveying dances and songs, which may
be ancient Maori ditties, but sound remark-
ably like coon melodies, to packed phalanxes
of pakehas. The Maori vocal organ, like
the Malay, isn’t very highly developed,
but there is a sturdy heartiness about
the show that is refreshing, and the moko of
the distinguished leader is a very elegant
piece of tattooing. Guide Susan, who pro-
vides the comedy, deserves special mention,
and Mount Ruapehu, in the backcloth, is
good tourist propaganda. Until the supply
of Maorilanders who have never seen a Maori
runs out there will be no need for the troupe
to raise the tangi of farewell.

“Cappy Ricks” pursues the briny tenor of
his way at Sydney Palace. It is an interest-
ing speculation as to how a person like
Cappy would have dealt with Tom Walsh.

“The Lady of the Rose” is finding it hard
to tear herself away from Sydney Royal.
The sadness of farewell has been postponed
till to-morrow week.
Sound musicianship and a knowledge of
the moderns helped to make Nevill-Smith's
song recital one of the features of the week's
music. Mr. Nevill-Smith belongs to the
growing school of what may be called “liter-
ary” singers—the people who acknowledge
that the words and the theme may mean as
much as the music of the song. Ravel's
“Peacock” and the Zandonai number which
he introduced to Sydney were given with
dramatic force and perfect diction. Frank
Hutchens, Rhys Kemmis and Vern Barnett
helped to round off the evening.
An out-of-doors show in Sydney:—
.Tames R. Jackson, in his show of pictures at
the Hordern Gallery, does not venture boldly into
the savage turmoil of the Million City, but prefers
to look at it on still autumn days from vantage-
points across the Harbor. At that distance the
dust, smoke and steam that blacken the lungs of
the slaves of industry' resolve themselves into a
charming mist sirJ the jumble of tenements and
factories into fairy palaces. There is a fine lumin-
osity about most of the canvases, but in his
preoccupation with the delights of the distant scene
Jackson is apt sometimes to scamp his foregrounds
and heaviness of touch and lack of drawing in
his near-by gums detract from the significance of
some compositions. A board-meeting of jugs and
pitchers is very satisfying in the unctuous quality
of its paint. He is not so much at home indoors
in his full-length portrait of a woman looking in
a mirror, which is slickly executed but contains
little characterisation ; but his study of two members
of the Sunshine Club exhibiting flesh-tints in a
secluded sylvan kn iseape is admirably done.
This week at Sydney Tivoli Wee Georgia
Wood has arrayed himself in the short
breeches and khaki jacket of Baden-Powell’s
broomstick warriors, and refuses to regard
his mother’s acquisition of a new husband
as a kind deed. However, the stepfather
has a daughter, and his juvenile resentment
is mollified. Scott Sanders is supplying an
interesting little turn as a knife-grinder, and
his wit is as keen as his cutlery. Marie
Lawton, the harpist, can also turn her hand
to the piano and use a rich and melodious
voice into the bargain. The heavenly choir
that gets Marie Lawton will get a prize.
At Sydney Fullers’ the Veterans of Variety
are bringing back to numerous middle-aged
and sedate patrons memories of a mis-
spent youth when, laden with prawns, they
staggered homeward singing the popular airs
of 30 years ago. The Veterans have resur-
rected the songs with which the old Chowder
Bay beau serenaded his tight-bodiced belle,
and if some of them sound foolish our
modern-day melodies with their queries as to
the maternal instincts of a shrimp can
hardly be described as brilliant.
Sydney Hoyt’s current programme carries
a large appeal to the child-mind and the
adult who sometimes likes to forget that In-
is grown up. “Little Robinson Crusoe,’’
with Jackie Coogan in the name-part, is for
the most part delightful comedy, with a
climax thrilling enough to cause a nightmare
among the more sensitive of the younger
audience. Australian pictures are making
slow but sure progress, but one feels that
progress would be more rapid if pictures of

“The Adventures of Algy” type, produced
by Beaumont Smith, and now at the Lyceum,
were left alone. While there is a general
improvement in the acting, and while
Claude Dumpier, around whose antics the
picture seems to have been written, is pass-
ably funny, the story loses interest in the
frantic attempt of the producer to introduce
as many varied and wide-apart Australian
scenes as possible. Scenic background is of
secondary interest to a story that will hold
the attention and acting that is really worth
while, and it’s about time the Australian
producer realised that his success must de-
pend on the encouragement he offers our best
writers and actors.
Frith will cease to be a Mopham at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s next Friday night, and he
and the stiff stride of William Senior 'will
transfer to “Whirled Into Happiness” on
Saturday. But the revival is for five nights
only; on July 4 “Sally” Melville will be
back to try “Kid Boots” on Melbourne.
“On Our Selection” was intended to run
for four weeks only; General Demand has
issued orders to make it six. Not until July
11 is a change due at the King’s, when
Thurston Hall will make a flying visit on
“The Broken Wing.”
Pauline Frederick having said good-bye to
Melbourne, Muriel Starr and Frank Harvey
will fill the gap at the Royal on Saturday
with “Secrets.”
Melbourne bade a tumultuous farewell to
Dot Brunton at the New Princess on Satur-
day, when the bright lady made her
last bow as “Little Jessie James.” On
Saturday the theatre re-opens with “No, No,
Nanette.”
The Melbourne Repertory players are pre-
paring Clemence Dane’s “A Bill of Divorce-
ment,” which is to have a week’s run at the
Playhouse, commencing on July 4. Isabel
Handley is directing the production.
Dorothea Spinney’s most successful night
in Melbourne was that upon which she de-
livered the “Hippolytus” of Euripides, which
is full of lyrical passages. Miss Spinney
was successful equally in the soliloquies of
the gods, the sonorous speeches of Hippoly-
tus, and the passion and madness of Phaedra,
his stepmother, who loves him and makes
assault upon the firm rock of his moral in-
tegrity. There was distinction, too, about
the recital of Robert Browning’s “The Ring
and the Book,” in which the death of Pom-
pilia from the wounds inflicted by her hus-
band was described with pathos and dignity.
Edward A. Vidler was given the services
of the Australian Institute of Arts and
Literature for the production of a “one-act
fantasy,” •“Pan Calls,” at the Queen’s Hall
last Thursday. In Vidler’s offering, the in-
fluence of Pan, whose song is heard off-stage,
upon two pairs of lovers make a whimsical
theme well conceived and worked out. The
evening at the Queen’s Hall was well spent.
❖* * *
“The Laughter of Fools,” revived on
Saturday for the last five nights of the John
D. O’Hara season at the Melbourne
Athenaeum, provided a personal triumph for
Lorna Helms, who had been lured back to
play her old part of Elizabeth, the charity-
home girl, promoted to the job of parlor-
maid in a pretentious household which
does not like to admit that its income runs
merely to a general. The part of the half-
witted girl whose remaining faculties are
paralysed by the tyranny of her mistress
might easily be a painful one; but without
any unpardonable exaggeration Lorna Helms
got pure laughter out of it. Emma Temple,
as Mrs. Grieg, and Zoe Wenke (whose work
shows rapid improvement) and Reginald
Collins as her daughter and son, made a
satisfactory triumvirate of snobs as a foil
to the John Rassett Grieg of John P.
O’Hara. But for his habit of choking out
his lines through the sobs witli which he fills
his throat, O’Hara was good as the old,
despised house-father. Maggie Jarvis has
evidently learnt the throat-sob from him, but
was appealing enough as Doris Hendley
and Martin Walker was an acceptable lover:
Reg Roberts’s tendency to shout his lines
was more pronounced than usual; and J. B.
Atholwood and Eardley Turner were respon-
sible for neat cameos. Advanced a week
from the original intention, Lee White and
Clay Smith’s season with “Let's Go” is to
start oji Saturday; so O’Hara finishes on
Thursday.
The Ivreisler season starts at the Audi-
torium on Saturday night, and the beauty
and chivalry of Melbourne hatie promised
to be there. I

Wish Wynne turned up at the Melbourne
Tivoli almost unannounced last Saturday.
She was with a theatrical combination which
more or lesis successfully travelled “The
East,” but, landing on the wrong coast of
this continent, disbanded; whereupon the
Tivoli, finding the lady available, put her to
work at once. But the inclination to stout-
ness which has come to Wish Wynne has
spoilt the artlessness which made her a rage.
At least one of her sketches left only an im-
pression of dullness, although later she im-
proved, and made her points more tellingly,
although not with the old-time irresistible
naivete. She is now an acceptable vaude-
ville turn, but not a star item. Ernest Hast-
ings is a notable addition. With a good
piano and a moderate voice and without
greasepaint, his drollery provides a refresh-
ing entertainment. But Zoronda La Belle, a
pretentious “Mexican Prima Donna,” gives
an act which the management will try to
forget directly her contract is at, an end. In
the meantime it would do well td> curtail it.

Substantial Alice Hollander, with Arthur
Sandford as her pianist, is back at Mel-
bourne Bijou. Songs with a popular appeal
help the act. The lady in the Huley and
Bent partnership puts a vim into a domestic
scene which carries it through with a bang—
a whole series of bangs and crashes, in fact.
It is rather amazing to see a capable come-
dian like George Wallace cramping his oppor-
tunities with such poor stuff as “The Village
Boys’ ; and the attempt to get two tons of
humor out of one pound of comedy butter is,
to say the least, pathetic. Wallace is good;

The British Music Society entertained it-
self and its friends at the Melbourne Assem-
bly Hall last Friday with a programme
limited to the works of Gustav Holst. The
main item was the imposing suite, “The
Planets," which for its full value needs an
orchestral setting. However, two pianos,
with Harold Elvins and William James in
trout of them, helped to give an idea of the
big conception of one of the largest orchestral
creations of modern times; and, as a full
orchestral rendering is promised later in the
year, their performance will whet many appe-
tites. The most notable of the other items
was a carol sung by live invisible singers
(Masters Cardwell and Young, and Messrs.
A. Brown, Edwin Hooke and Tliexton Mor-
ph ett), “In the Black Midwinter”—a very
effective bit of work.
A concert by Marjorie Hanchard at Mel-
bourne Queen's Hall was altogether enjoy-
able. Though lacking any great distinction,
Miss Hanchard sings nevertheless intelli-
gently and with clear articulation. “Eos
Petits Oiseaux” was amongst the best of her
offering of 24 songs—an exacting task. The
‘ Chansonette” of Mona Mcßurney, a local
composer, was given a good reception.
The Melbourne String • Quartette’s second
concert at the Assembly Hall further im-
proved its standing in public opinion. Mozart’s
Quartet in C major began rather tamely,
but the changes in theme between the violin
and cello were well worked, and, the players
being thoroughly in their stride by the, time
the Minuet was reached, tin 1 performance was
full of grace and sparkle. William Gamble
with his viola had a lot to do in the Glazou-
now quartette, and did it very well; in the
mercurial Scherzo a particularly colorful
tonal effect was reached, and the needier-
anno was a spirited and exhilarating finish.
The “Nigger” quartette of Dvorak was ex-
cellently done also. Bernard Ileinze, Stanley
1 ompkins, William Gamble and Gouis Ilat-
tenbach deserved the applause they won.
There is artistic work in “Decameron
Nights.” One of the most ambitious of Bri-
tish films to date, it keeps more closely to
the verities than most of the big things pro-
duced in America. Hoyt’s De Guxe shows it
in Melbourne this week, with the misusing
“Tomboy” to lighten the programme. The
Majesties chief bill is “Pal o’ Mine.”
Richard Talmadge in “Stepping Gively”
adds breathlessness to the programme, which,
to. allure tennis “fans,” has a screening of
Tilden in the process of making his strokes
to slow movement. The “Sea' Hawk” has
had a wonderful season at the Auditorium—
“No seats after seven o’clock” has been the
constant cry—but is finishing this week. On
Saturday “The Ten Commandments” makes
its reappearance, this time at Hoyt’s New
Gaiety.
A remarkable film having its first Austra -
lian run at Adelaide Town Hall' is a bold
attempt to get the Old Testament on the
screen. The title, “After Six Days,” sug-
gests the Creation, which large order is, how-
ever, hurried through to enlarge upon Adam
and Eve and their descendants. The spec-
tacular items are well done, especially the
Flood and the destruction of Sodom. Joseph
and his brethren get a long chapter. The
career of Moses is followed closely. But
here, after a gallant success, the story goes
to pieces. Either the producer lost his head
or, more probably, an unwise selection has
been made from a too-great length of film
available. Anyway, the story takes a record
long jump from the death of Moses to the
judgment of Solomon, then ruin-s off the
Scriptural rails and develops at great length
a love affair of Solomon with a fair girl
whom his dark queen eventually causes to be
stabbed. Sunday-school superintendents can
almost be heard tearing their whiskers at
this unauthorised gloss on Scripture, for which
the obvious dramatic possibilities of Sapison
and Samuel, Ruth and David, have been
passed over. Forgetting the last half-hour
so so, “After Six Days” is a good thing.
Guy Bates Post has scored a success at
Adelaide Royal as the semi-civilised Rajah
of Rukh, with Geslie Victor as the renegade
Englishman, and Winnington Barnes the
bluff boozer who “lied like a gallant gentle-
man” when dying. But Zillah Bateman is
now the lady fought over, and Gerald Pring
has moved up into the part of her unofficial
lover. A charming and unusual show is
Clive Carey, of the Conservatorium, lectur-
ing on old English songs and illustrating
tunefully as he goes. Stiffy and Mo are at
the Majestic, a host in themselves. Adelaide
has just discovered, tardily after its custom,
that Chuhaldin’s fiddle is in its midst, and is
starting to do him honor. The York has two
good pictures from familiar plays. “The
Dancers” and “Three Wise Fools” ; Wonder-
graph has Thomas Meighan : and West’s a
fine Jack Gondon story, complete with hound.
POVERTY
POINT
CARLYON'S
HOTEL
ST KILDA MELBOURNE
A ONN-MAN SHOW.
“Gwy”: Bert Baile. conductor of the
just-returned Newcastle Steelworks Band,
discovered when he reached Britain that there
had been a great advance in the standard
of band-music. Instead of being confined as
formerly to well-worn operatic
arrangements and variations of national airs,
and harmless stuff of that sort, the modern
band is treated with the same respect as
an orchestra by “eminent musicians who
realise the possibilities of 24 good men pos-
sessing advanced technique and good tonal
qualities.” Percy Fletcher, Sydney Jenkins,
Hubert Bart, Dr. Keighley and Weston
Nicholl, the two last-named organists of
standing, are writing original compositions
in symphonic form, and getting the brass
bands to cultivate orchestral touch. The new
development meant unexpected hard work
for Baile’s men, but they showed their quality
by quickly adapting themselves to the altered
conditions and holding their own with the
finest bands in Britain.
“Schnorrer”: The homing Jew takes his
love of music and the theatre with him to
Palestine. While Balfour was in Jerusalem
for the opening of the Hebrew University
he attended a performance of “Belshazzar.’’
“Aida” was also played during the Balfour
visit, and the Jerusalem Musical Society
gave a series of concerts. And the cinema
has followed the return of Israel to its
ancient territdry. In fact, interval cries of
“Peanuts and clioc’lates” are heard on the
slopes of Zion, and Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like the well-to-do dames of
Jewry in the circle seats.
“Neebsah”: The “Kreutzer Sonata” is
always associated in my mind with Carrodus.
He was England’s premier violinist during
his time—leader for years of the orchestra
at Covent Garden. As a soloist he had the
three t’s—tone, technique and temperament.
The “Kreutzer” was played by him on the
occasion of one of his rare solo engagements,
and at a subsequent gathering of the elect
lie was urged to devote himself to solo work.
“Can’t afford to wait for solo engagements,”
he replied. “I’ve 52 meals a day to provide.”
There was a deafening shout of “What!”
“We’re 13 in family,” he explained, “and
we sit down four times a day.”
“laid”: Accepting “ilamfat’s” statement
as correct —he names no names —that “an
Australian actress recently played second
lead in a well-known London theatre for
£8 per week” (B. 2S/5/’25), what is there
to complain about? The mummeress did a
wise thing in accepting the engagement:
hundreds of Englisn actresses would jump at
the chance of getting such a show in London.
Should she make a hit, the managers of 40-
odd West-end theatres would immediately
become interested in her, and her salary
would jump up to whatever, in reason, she
cared to ask. In her native country, on the
other hand, dramatic artists are not in
demand. There is very little play production
and no managerial competition. “Hamfat”
asserts that “it is a lucky mummer in the
Cold Land who works more than half-time.”
There are well-known actors and actresses
in. Australia who. during late years, have
not worked quarter-time.
“Caesar's Ghost”: That yarn about Por-
kins, who travelled with a theatrical co. to
collect a debt on a
50-50 basis (B.
7/5/’25), reminds
me of a Maoriland
publican who, cer-
tain distressful cir-
cumstances having
been explained,
“came to light” pro-
perly. He agreed
not only to wait for
the money our show
owed him, but to
pay off all our
other creditors, pro-
vided we gave him
50 per cent, of the
offertories. The
bargain was struck,
and we found him
an asset. A good
“sport,” he was
popular wherever
he was known; in
fact, everybody
thought it a duty to
see “Bill’s show.”
“Houses” were so
good that we in-
duced ' him to stay
longer and take a
smaller percentage;
and the ease with
which he was in-
duced proved that
he was enjoying
himself. Then we
found ourselves in
a district which
knew not Bill, so
Bill, now only a
jovial encumbrance,
was paid up in full.
But by that time
the eo. had a comfortable bank balance.
“C\K." on concert-singers’ fees: —
Toti dal Monte, it is reported, is to receive £6OOO
for a series of 12 concerts in England. Fees for
concert singers of the highest rank have advanced
tremendously since Adelina Patti, Albani and Nordica
were in their prime. Albani and Nordica were supposed
to get 200 guineas per The figure is probably
right—something unusual happened to make it public.
In the late ’eighties Nordica was engaged by Dr. Abram
to sing Sullivan’s “Golden Legend’’ and Rossini’s
“Stabat Mater” (a very stiff programme for one
evening) at St. Leonards, on the South Coast (Eng.). 1
was the tenor. About 4 o’clock on the afternoon
of the ccneert Madame had the misfortune to lodge
a fish-bone in her throat, and there was no possi-
bility of her singing that evening. Happening to
know Antoinette Trebelii’s London address, I got
Abram to wire for her, and she arrived, luckily, in
time. The doctor made the usual announcement about
returning money, but nobody seemed to mind, and
Tony, who was at the beginning of her career (Aus-
tralia knew her later as Antonia Dolores), made a
big success. Afterwards Nordica sued Abram for
her 200-guinea fee, but an unsympathetic jury
declined to give it to her.
“W.LU.”: Unionism at Broken Hill goes
about in top-hat and spats these days. B.
Ivrantz, the big gun in local amusements,
complained lately that, owing to members
of his orchestras following other occupations
during the day, they came in the evening too
tired to give satisfactory entertainment to
patrons. The musicians met this with a
peremptory demand for a published apology
within 48 hours, otherwise Ivrantz’s players
would give a week’s notice, and the Barrier
Industrial Council assured the noisomakers
that the musicians would have its support
if they declared his shows “black.” Ivrantz
knew what this meant, so after raving for 24
hours at his helplessness he unreservedly
withdrew his remarks and apologised to the
musicians.
“Simon”: Before the subject of precipi-
tately wedded pairs is exhausted, “the largest
couple in the world” deserve a paragraph.
They were doing the country shows. She
was billed as “the fattest woman in the uni-
verse—when she walks the earth trembles.”
lie was “the gentle giant from La Tlata,
Sft. 2in., and still growing.” They struck
the same town, and their spruikers decided
that they should double up rather than run
opposition pitches. Thus “the largest couple
in the world” came into existence. The
giant, a woodchopper in private life, bashful
and slow-witted at best, looked preposter-
ously small for his inches, as, standing- be-
side his she-colossus, he gawkislily answered
a score of questions from the audience re-
garding the size and sex of the numerous
“children” with which the outside spruikers
had credited them. The “marriage” was dis-
solved when the pay-office closed.
“Black Out” : I once had to open a door to
Arthur Styan’s knock in “Hypocrites.” I had
nothing to say, my job being merely to open
the portal and take the gentleman’s hat, and I
got along fairly well till one fatal Thursday
night when Styan was a fraction late. In-
stead of giving me the hat he put it on a
seat and advanced a few steps. Suddenly re-
calling what I had to do, and being a
thorough gentleman, he came back, picked up
the hat and gave it to me. Then was I
struck dead, as the saying goes. I felt
as if I were holding in my hand not only
the hat but the gentleman himself, the seat,
the door and the entire set. A kindly scene-
shifter came to the rescue with a hoarse
whisper from the wings: “Hey, come off!”
And off I hurried without the hat, the seat
Styan or the set.
Three Melbourne Art shows :
If J. Muir Auld’s oils' kept up to the standard
of his water-colors, his first show in Melbourne, at the
New Gallery, would be very fine indeed. The water-
colors exhibit the craft of an artist who, with
clear pictures in his mind, paints with a full brush,
and does no patchwork. Mainly he has picturised
the scenes in the neighborhood of his home at
Deewhy, Sydney, and the sparkle of the water, with
the warmth of the atmosphere, has been captured.
But the work in the oils is heavy, with the exception
of three items —a very real bit of Australia in “Trees
at Long Reef” (No. 23), “Sunny Afternoon” (No.
24) and “The Creek, Afternoon” (No. 31).
Eleven artists contribute to a mixed show of
30 items at the Sackville Gallery—a refreshing
little collection. Harold Herbert contributes one of
them, good work, though nothing above his average,
in “The Vista” ; but G. C. Benson’s four items arc
the most distinguished offering. He presents vivid
views of color occasionally approaching the bizarre,
but containing truth. His contrasts have a note
of originality which is refreshing. F. G. Reynolds
presents two ambitious canvases. One of them,
“Pumpkin Patch” (No. 27), in pursuit of the Brang-
wyn style, makes a poetic composition; but he is
unable to retrieve “Dandenongs” (No. 28) from a
monotony his subject should not possess. The young
A. T. H. Bernaldo, who shows high endeavor in his
work, gets vigor into his “Horse Team,” but his
“Landscape” is distressing. Some likeable work
by George Coleville, a “Landscape” with stiff shadows
by H. B. Harrison, three conscientious offerings by
R. Taylor Ghee, a good floral painting and a poor
landscape by Miss A. E. Bale, and some poor
smudgy work by T. H. Bone, with two confused
minor items by Bess Golding, complete the show.
The old idea that women are seldom true to their
sox is exemplified in the annual exhibition of the
Women’s Art Club: most of the exhibitors have sent
better work to other exhibitions than they show in
their own. Vet, although disappointing on thar
account, there are many items of an appealing nature
amongst the 139 exhibits shown at the Athenaeum
Hall. Annie Gates is responsible for several of them,
and there is good work by Norah Gurdon, Dora
Wilson, A. E. Oakley. E. Roach, D. Stone, D. Hinch-
cliffe, E. Lakeland, A. E. M. Bale and others. But
there is a lot of bad work, too—conspicuously “A
Water Nymph” and a “Dutch Flower Garden” that
would be declared a public nuisance in a well-
regulated community. The ploughman in an other-
wise good picture by J. C. F. Traill looks like a
broken dothes-peg standing against the light. Esther
Paterson has some portrait work nit up to the
standard now expected of her; indeed, with the
exception of one item by Dora Wilson, the portraiture
is wooden and weak, with very stiff posing. Mar-
garet Baskerville and Ola Cohn contribute to the
sculpture section, the work of the latter being par-
ticularly attractive; and D. Tompkins and A. Gates
have some very daintily-painted china.
ROMANCE AND GAS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m just a plain collector-mail.
But somewhere deep in me
There dwells a love of old romance
And days of chivalry.
So with the Scarlet Pimpernel,
Beau Brummel and Beaucaire
I mingle in nocturnal dreams,
All their adventures share.
With noble Sidney Carton, too,
I tread the Only Way ;
Tears spring for Mary Queen of Scots
Immured in Fotheringay ;
One classic play enthralled my soul
Yclept “The Might Have Been,’’
And admiration filled my heart
For its poor tragic queen.
Absorbed I called me at a house;
When wide the door was flung,
And I saw who stood facing me,
All speech forsook my tongue.
It was my Queen of “Might Have Been/'
In blouse and skirt arrayed ;
Unstockinged feet thrust in old shoes,
A picture strange she made.
Great swcatdrops glistened on her brow,
Ourlpins were in her hair,
While soapsuds covered rounded arms
From wrist to shoulder bare.
At last I stammered out, “The gas—
There's six-and-six to pay!”
She took a clothes-peg from her mouth:
“Your luck’s dead out to-day.”

AMUNDSEN’S FLIGHT.
THE wonderful Polar flight from which Captain Amundsen lias just
returned is final proof of the excellence of “OASTROL” lubrication.
When it is remembered that the engines were subjected to the pitiless
severity of the Arctic climate the performance can be properly estimated. The
’planes, on descending, were immediately frozen in, and would need to be
broken free from the imprisoning ice when the home flight was to begin.
The ’plane, carrying the whole party, rose without hesitation, and returned
to the point where the sealer picked up the explorers.
As ever, “CASTROL” was a loyal helper. Just as this lubricant
retains its wonderful viscosity under blazing equatorial heat, so does it
remain fluid and efficient amid Arctic snows. “CASTROL” defies the
thermometer. Neither heat nor cold can impair its honest service.

Reaches Every Part of Every Tooth
TINY food particles cannot remain lodged between your
teeth and become decayed if you use the Pro-phy-lac-tic
Tooth Brush.
The scientific construction of the Pro-ohy-lac-tic enables it
to reach every part of every tooth and to thoroughly clean both
the teeth and the gums at every brushing.
The curved surface of the Pro-phy-lac-tic fits the mouth per-
fectly. The tufted bristles reach in between the teeth, while
the large end tuft cleans the backs of the front teeth as well as
the backs of the hard-to-reach molars. To keep your teeth
sound and clean, always insist upon the Pro-phy-lac-tic.
Made in three sizes: Adult, Small and Baby, in medium, soft and
hard bristles. Always sold in the yellow box. Look for the fac-simile
hyphenated name propfcj%Ss on both box and brush handle.

Be Pretty! Be Dainty!
Be Attractive!
Be a Rexona Girl!
Use only
Rexona Soap
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their beautiful skin and hair.
To be a Rexona Girl is to use only Rexona Soap and enjoy that natural
beauty of the skin and hair which cannot be imitated, but can be
obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them
contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate
texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot
heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic
balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment
of skin affections is known throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or twice
a day and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen
the tendency to pimples and leave the complexion clear, fresh and
velvety.
Miss SAD IK GALE,
a charming liexona Girl ,
rrrites: “I find Rexona
Soap excellent for the hair,
also most refreshing after
make-up.”

R.R.D.: “Farewell, My Home,” reads a
good deal like we’d expect it to. See if you can’t
get hold of something that hasn’t been written
to rags.... T.McC.: Not enough in it; and you
drag in words and phrases for the sake of the
infrequent rhymes John M.; “Watchman” is too
crudely done. The story is worth more elbow-
grease. .. .C.S.S.: Why take so much pains to hide
your meaning?... .5.8. K.: Too many knots in your
“Stringy Bark”.... J.J.D.; The opening lines of
“Conscience” are very promising;—
Would that my senses were dull as a cow’s
That my thoughts could be sweet.
But you couldn’t keep it up.... Duncan C.: Your
sonnet wants sand-papering. But it has got an
idea.... J.M.S.Y.; Unsuitable. .. .Sylvester : “Weeds"
tempted us ; but the point wasn’t quite sharp enough.
. ...W.H. (M.L.): “Bachelor’s Dreams” have been
dreamt too often. .. .P.K.S.: Don’t care for it....
G.E.; Starts well, but doesn’t keep up the pace.
....Lefty: Whenever did we print anything that
would make you tnink we would print that?....
Kmma T.; This office is one of the worst markets
in the world for parodies... .J.A.D.; “Aspiration”
has too many phrases that don’t seem to mean
anything. “Nocturne” is better, but uneven....
Arno: Hardly. But in its rough way it has merits.
E.M.E.: “Song of the Saddle” beaten by the
length of a stirrup-iron.... Ben .'long: No music,
no sense, no anything... .R.C.H.: No originality
there either.... Royal Navy: Heavy as a cold dough-
boy.... Mac.: Jingle must be better than that to
pass when the subject, is so wrinkled with age
and ill-treatment. .. .Bellerive: As an example oi
the descriptive poem, this seems to cover the entire
ground :
Prom England she’d cleared her way
Across the bounding foam,
Laden with British merchandise,
The ill-fated Brianhome.
An explosion sealed the vessel’s doom,
Her ocean reign was o’er,
Smoke issued from her hatches,
And lurid flames did roar.
Stokers perished at their posts,
And victims ’neath the waves,
Gasping in the throes of death,
Were hurled to briny graves.
Too sudden was the calamity
For action or to pray;
They were hurried to eternity
For ever and for aye.
’Twas dawn upon the island coast,
Borne by the surging foam,
Shoreward drifted wreckage
Of the ill-fated Brianhome.
Teme K.: Hasn’t that “bob in” been won yet?
Kalboonga: You’ll have to give us something
more definite about your serpent than that....
W.L.W.: Immortality for the gifted author of
“Cucumbers” and “When the frightened lizard sheds
its tail” must be sought elsewhere. .. .P.F.: In-
genious idea, but can’t advertise it....D.A.: Well
enough written, but spindles into thin air....M.5.:
The haberdashery harlequinade has been sent to the
wrong shop.... A.L.W.: Try another interest. Life
is not all sex. . . .G.C.T.: It goes along in a dull
sing-song until it gets to the “barm that levels all
evil,” whatever that may mean; then it starts off
to leap and cavort in a mad fashion. .. .J.R. (North
Sydney): It fails to hold the attention... .Paul R.:
Doesn’t move us. . . .W.F. (Hunter’s Hill) : Very poor.
... Kado: We have no idea what it is all about....
M.K. (Perth) : Both miss, but the “aerial” carries a
good idea.... Cuthbert: “The Spoil Sport” is not
bright enough... .C.O’M.: The story is built to an
old formula. .. .J.R.P.: Not quite Scog: It sounds
artificial and hollow. In verse nothing can quite
take the place of sincerity... .1.H.5.: Misses. Try to
write something with real feeling. .. .E.K. (New-
town): No real yarn there... .E.D. (Perth): Those
abstractions in the “Old Story” get tiresome....
G.T. (Elsternwick) : “Derelict” misses. . . .R.8.C.:
The grammar goes wrong in the first stanza; the
rhymes are false in the second and third; the
rhythm is lumpy all through ; and the subject is old
and poorly handled. ... D. 8.0.: Far too rugged....
J.M.D.: It doesn’t get near enough to pass the time
of day.. . .D.M.G.: “Orientale” has some of the color,
but goes out of tune too often ; the sea verses are too
much on the, old pattern. .. .N.J.N.: Says nothing....
E.J.G.: The verse moves heavily. .. .X.Y.Z.: Not up.
....Will M.: The boarding-house idea wanted better
handling. .. .Alta: Poor verse. .. .E.J.0.: “Married
Love” doesn’t convince... .P.O.MacC.: The matter
amounts to nothing and the verse is clumsy....
Clarence T.: You have very little idea of metre....
E.G.A.: An old tale badly handled.... Reg C.:
Nothing there... .Walter L.: They don’t strike us
hard enough... .Norman F.: Too thin for u 5....
G.D. (Balmain) : “Emma” is unpleasant and by no
means convincing... .J.W.H.: No g00d... .T.L.C.:
Not up by some distance... .A.T.A.: The sonnet is
not attractive; and the form is p00r... .8.0’C.:
Pretty fair. But the last line of the octet is wicked
—“Rush on, thou white-plumed ranks !”... .W.D.F.:
Seems to us marred by the behavior of Bryan
towards the end... .M.8.P.: First stanzas good, last
two commonplace.... Snail’s Bay: Keeps jangling
out of tune.... Ugly Face: Our kick has already
been registered. .. .S.A.T.R.: Not a glint in it....
Bunyip: “We pay more to and hold in higher esteem
the man who trains our horses than the man who
trains our children.” That’s your text; and now
who is “we” ?.. . .Uca: Does it mean anything?....
J.M.C.: Too thin. ... Te Kara: Sorry to have to be
so rude as to say that the lady isn’t worth half
the space.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L.D.; It has odd points of merit, but it’s too late.
. ...C.McH.: No breath of life in its nostrils....
A.R.: Fades into rumor about the feet and hands.
. ...H.E.; Like the griffin, your flapper is a mixed
and dubious animal. .. .M.G.: You’re quite wrong
—the jokes are the trouble. .. .F.G.S.: Belongs to
the plein air or pavement school of Art... .H.W.T.:
Your drawing is still in a trance. Only the jokes
show signs of life —they are growing whiskers. The
dead frequently d0....J.C. and H.R.M.: Not up.
“Wanchai”: Do the Japanese along the
Bananaland coast continue to buy opal ex-
tensively? Five years ago they made a
profitable business of it, retailing the stones
in “the East.” I know one Jap sailor who
bought £5O worth, and on his return trip
invested £llO, which represented the pro-
ceeds of his sales in the land of the Rising
Sun. When I last looked in on Japan opals
were still remarkably popular and in brisk
demand.

“Machete”: The Spaniard and the Italian
are not the only makers of wine who trample
the grapes in the winepress (B. 11/6/’25).
The same method may still be seen in the
great wine districts of France and Germany.
Many of the wines thus produced, in France
especially, are renowned for their delicate
and elusive flavor and nuances of “tone.”
These, it is contended, would be ruined by
machine-crushing, which is apt to free dele-
terious flavors in and under the grape-
skins, as careful foot-trampling does not.
The mess left from the first pressing is often
machine-crushed and used for an inferior
wine. As to the method being revolting, that
may be said of the preparation of most foods.
Book at the way meat is pawed and patted
about by dubious hands, even in the best-
inspected and most hygienic of butchers’
shops.
* * # *
“Stony": The time-payment system looks
attractive in ads. designed to arrest the eye
of the matrimonially-inclined. Take the case
of the firm which offers a bedroom-suite for
“f 19 10s. cash, or 18 monthly payments of
245. each.” A simple calculation shows that
an extra 425. is paid for the time-payment
accommodation. It looks like about 7 per
cent, interest per annum—and so it would be
if the £l9 10s. and interest were paid at
the end of the 18 months, instead of in in-
stalments. Actually, although the interest
rate on the £l9 10s. for the first month is
only about 7 p.c., the interest charged on
the final monthly capital-payment is well
over 100 p.c. per annum ! Sound advice to
those about to furnish without capital worth
mentioning seems to be to blanket them-
selves on the floor for a few weeks, buy a
bed out of the money they would pay to the
time-payment man, and go on feathering the
nest by slow degrees for cash.
* ♦ * *
“Rents” : When a landlord wished to obtain
possession of the four-roomed mod. bung,
with all cons, he had let to what had proved
to be an undesirable tenant, he relied on a
N.S.W. case that notice to quit within ten
days, the tenth day not falling on the one
which terminated a week’s tenancy, was suffi-
cient. It has, however, now been held in
a Divisional Court in England, an authority
of weight, that this won’t do. Something
more precise is needed —the slack ways of
the Dominions must not be encouraged. “In
a weekly or monthly tenancy,” said the
Court, “the period for which notice to quit
must be given must always be regulated by
the date and the length of the letting, unless
there is some special agreement to the con-
trary. In a weekly tenancy the notice to
quit is a week’s notice expiring at the end
of a periodic week, and in a monthly tenancy
the month’s notice must expire at the end
of a periodic month.”
* * * *
“Sixenate”: In these days of H.C.L. it
isn’t surprising that a protest is heard occa-
sionally about court fees. In a Melbourne
case a medical witness began by asking where
his fee was coming from, and, being assured
that the plaintiff’s solicitors would see about
that, eyed the gentleman in question dubi-
ously. and mentioned that the fee due in
another case was still unpaid. The solici-
tors promptly put the guinea on the ledge
,of the witness-box; but the doctor, who was
wound up by this time, hotly remarked that
the amount tendered was very inadequate—•
the B.M.A. thought three guineas a fair
thing. It looked like a deadlock until '8
Honah pointed out that, as the Court had
no power to order anything above the guinea,
the doctor would save everyone’s time, in-
cluding his own, by getting on with his evi-
dence. The medico took the advice, as well
as the money, and snorted another protest
as_ he left the court. Doubtless he had a
grievance, but hundreds of jurymen are worse
off than casual professional witnesses.
“Harold Hardupp”: A good, honest fire
seems a more likely means of collecting
money from insurance cos. than the “rain
insurance” resorted to by Melbourne organ-
isations apprehensive of losing profits from
open-air gatherings owing to weather con-
ditions. St. Kilda carnival a few months
ago was insured against rain, but found it
could collect no compensation when a dry
storm tore into its tents and decorations and
kept the crowd away on its opening night.
The Carlton F'ootball Club has been simi-
larly unfortunate in connection with its
carnival held at the Motordrome. The show
was for three nights, and the committee took
out a policy against ten points of rain fall-
ing between 5.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on any
evening. On the third evening rain com-
menced to fall, and, being obviously only
a sample lot of more to follow, kept the
crowd away. But the Government Meteoro-
logist reported that only one point of rain
fell during the time covered by the insurance,
so the club found that its premium had been
paid for nothing.
* * * *
“Saw Dust”: Before Justice Higgins
quitted the Commonwealth Arbitration Court
lie granted the application of the Australian
timber-workers for a 44-hour working week.
The boon was enjoyed by the log converters
for 21 months, the result being that costs
piled up by anything from 10 to 15 per cent.,
and imports from North America and the
Baltic swelled inordinately. Then the saw-
millers convinced the Full Arbitration Court
that an economic crisis existed in the indus-
try ; so the 44-hour week was abandoned for
the bush places and country sawmills, but
not for city yards. During the long-drawn-
out timber case before Justice Webb in Mel-
bourne, 1922-23, the union vainly strove to
get the 44-hours restored to the bush and the
sawmills, the Deputy-President declaring that
the hours had been determined by the
F.F.A.C. and that there could be no going back.
But now, after near two years of more or
less (mostly less) amicable working, Irvine,
the Vic. C.J.. declares that the Webb award
does not read as the author thought it did,
and that there is serious doubt, on the terms
used, whether country sawmillers can legally
work their men 48 hours. That, of course,
will lead to further costly litigation, and
the man who wants 50 feet of scantling for
his fowlhouse will probably find another bob
tacked on to his bill.

Broken Hill has lost one of its first
settlers, George Bowen. He settled at Silver-
ton in 1883, at Biioken Hill two years later,
and in 1891 lie tocik over the management of
Burford’s soapworjks; this he held till the
end, which has cofcne, from a heart attack,
at 58.
“Chair”: When an American addresses
a letter he usually turns it over, and adds
the place it came from on the lapel of the
envelope. It is a, practice worth imitating,
for it ensures that an undeliverable letter
can be returned direct to the sender without
the month’s wait and subsequent dead-letter
office routine of opening, reading and re-
addressing.
“Clerk”: Right in the middle of the front
window of one of Melbourne’s leading shops,
amongst the tastefully-displayed lines, the
poster fairly shrieked its message in bold
capitals: “Stolen Goods.” But when the
astounded passer-by had shoved his way
through the crowd of rubbernecks, it was
to discover underneath the incriminating
words the saving clause in very small let-
ters: “Could not be much cheaper than
these.”
“Nikiko” : The popular sentiment in favor
of ending one’s days in the old land received
something of a set-back recently when Pat-
rick Shannon returned to Ireland with the
fortune he had made in Australia. He
bought a fawn at Carrowmore and settled
down to a peaceful old age. Raiders arrived
and demanded his money, and being refused
promptly beat the old man to death. No-
thing quite as bad could have happened to
him basck o’ Bourke.
Whejn the wrecker is mentioned in Collins-
street everybody knows that J. Whelan is
meant. In the rapid alteration of Flinders-
lane he is having a big say. He has done
every part of the job himself, and has a long
chronicle of narrow shaves; and now he
knows so much about wrecking that he can
almost tell at a glance how much good, sale-
able material will come out of a job. Usu-
ally he makes no charge. He is one of the
few men who have discovered the secret of
making a fortune by doing work for nothing.
“Arthur R.”: Commissioner Clapp’s
slogans become the subject of outrageous
imitation. The laStest, “Children, yes, and
grown-ups, too, Orange-juice is good for you,”
has spurred the proprietor of an Italian
f:-uit.sho»p, doubtless with the assistance of
some local litterateur, to appeal for custom
with “Children, yes, and grown-up man,
Love to chew the sweet banan’.” I am daily
expecting to see Tony Fishanchip’s, of a few
yards further along the street, fall into line
with : “Don’t have da bad food on you foist,
Patronise de steaka de oyst.”
Henry Allworth Ledger, who crossed the
bar the other day at the age of 82, knew
a lot about the manners and customs of
Binghi in the North. He picked up his
knowledge while opening up what is now
well-known Queensland cattle-country. He
was a nephew of Charlie Ledger, who made
the experiment of importing alpacas, despite
the Peruvian Government’s prohibition of
their export. As the alpacas turned out
failures under Australian conditions, Ledger
gained nothing but the Peruvian Govern-
ment’s dislike. In his later years the son
had a small job as a chamber magistrate.
“Ces” : In striking contrast to the dwind-
ling of once-prosperous mining-towns in Vic-
toria is the great progress made by agricul-
tural centres, particularly in the Wimmera
and Mallee. Horsham is typical; at its
present rate of progress it should soon reach
the dignity of a city. Its population lias
more than doubled in less than 15 years.
This centre of the Golden Wimmera, which
has not known a really bad season for 10
years, points with pride to Dooen-road, its
chief residential area, lined on both sides
with the comfortable homes of retired wheat-
farmers. Even the floating population is
estimated at nearly a thousand —mostly “bag-
men.” Secondary industries are beginning
to spring up, too : the manufacture of fibro-
cement plaster-sheets by two firms employs
about 200 hands. At a recent football match
there were just over 1000 cars parked on
the gi'ound.
“Westmoreland”: At Cairns (Q.) there is
preserved a piece of evidence of the physical
prowess of ex-Premier Theodore, a relic of
the days when he and his mate, Bill McCor-
mack, swung a formidable hammer to shape
a propeller for a disabled launch. It was in
1912, when the pair were merely obscure
Labor members, sitting in Opposition. Theo
dore and McCormack had gone to Port Doug-
las in a private launch on an electioneering
campaign, and it was at their destination it
was found necessary to replace the launch’s
propeller. A piece of 2in. x 2in. iron was
secured, and for a consideration of 30s. the
amateur mechanics were allowed to use the
tramway workshop and bash red-hot iron
into the requisite blades. It proved a hot.
thirsty job, but the pub was fairly handy,
and the “billy” boy fast and reliable. Though
not a work of art, the propeller served its
purpose and brought the launch to Cairns,
Avhere a sagacious publican secured it and
installed it behind the bar, selling many
drinks on the strength of it when Theodore
rose to eminence. The curio has since passed
into the possession of the Cairns Post.
“F.A.”: The pioneer gardener on the site
of the present Sydney Botanical Gardens
was Gerald, one of the “Scotch
whose constitutional-reform activities landed
them in N. S. Wales in the very early days.
Others of the party 'were Muir, Palmer and
Skirving. They had in the previous year
been convicted for participation in the society
known as the Friends of the People, -which
caused Pitt some unrest during the _ French
Revolutionary period. Gerald arrived m
Sydney at the end of 1794, and bought a
piece of ground on the "shores of Farm Cove.
Here the exile laid out a garden that was
the brightest thing in the drab settlement.
He lived there to enjoy it for only two years,
but his wish to be buried in the garden was
respected, albeit there is no monument to mark
his grave. Muir, by the way, escaped in
the year of Gerald’s death. He had bought
land on the Parramatta River, and called
his property Hunter’s Hill, after Ins patri-
monial estate in Scotland; the name of
suburb was not, as is generally supposed
derived from John Hunter, R.N., second Ho
ernor of the colony.

What makes motor car value?
6 ♦ Quality of materials
RELIABILITY in motoring depends
largely upon the quality of the materi-
als used in the axles, steering gear,
brakes, engine and other integral parts
of a car or truck.
General Motors takes double precau-
tions to assure materials of good quality
in the building of its cars and trucks.
For example: Its metallurgists spec-
ify 45 different steel analyses, for
uses as varied as the delicate needle
valve of a carburetor and the sturdy
frame of a GMC truck.
And to the tests of materials made
by the factory divisions are added
further tests by the General Motors
laboratories.

Point Piper Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN Once-Upon-a-Time there glowed
A castle on Point Piper-road;
A Castle of Fair Dreams to one
Whose feet were newly set upon
The morning path of young Romance
That climbs the golden hills of Chance.
The lady of the castle wore
All charms that bards have sung and more.
Her amber eyes were sweet as showers;
Her hands as soft as flannel flowers;
Her cheek was silk upon the loom,
Her lips the waratah in bloom.
Aye, tall —in fancy—yet she waits.
Bare-headed bv her cottage gates.
Whose rooms,'with kitchen, numbered tour,
And all upon tin l same first floor;
But still a castle which was not
Less fine than that of Camolot.
Above its six stone steps there grew
On either side camellias two.
That stiffly stood like wardens white
When one came up those steps at night;
When one came up to Avalon
A painted omnibus upon.
And, underneath a yellow light
Where street lamps flickered, said ‘Good
night”
Unto a weazened wight, whose reins.
Held tightly o'er the horses' manes.
Had guided safely, load by load.
Ilis fares along Point Piper-road.
No giant grim or dragon gaunt,
But one old kindly maiden aunt.
The treasure guarded. She. with wine
At parting, went to bed at nine.
And left her waiting charges free
To trifling or to tapestry.
’Twas then (one almost fears to tell)
Enchantment on that castle fell:
No sound from donjon, hall or moat;
The rustle of a petticoat,
A sigh suppressed, a smothered kiss
Were all that broke its magic bliss.
If whispers on a dim settee
In darkened corner there might be,
They never stirred the arras plain
That hung across the window-pane,
But died, unechoed, sweetly mute,'
like stifled notes within a flute.
A nibbling mouse, not over-near.
Might bring the lady passing fear.
And anxious shudders that excused
To closer contact. So. bemused.
The hours went bv. Alas, the hours.
Though lent by Time, can ne’er be ours!
And Time exacts for each short loan
A compound interest of his own.
We borrow Joy and pay with tears;
The grim churl keeps us in arrears.
He lends us youth, but with the stray
Cold coin of age he makes us pay.
That old stone cottage stands no more
With burnished knocker on the door.
And coir-mat laid for welcome feet
In-coming from a muddy street;
But where abides its lady fair.
I do not know, save Otherwhere.
Now modern flats ungainly squat
1 ike hateful toads unon the spot.
The Castle of the Clouds is gone
That called one oft to Avalon.
And gone the ’bus with all its load
I'liat rattled down Point Piper-road.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HE ledge was a narrow one, littered
with the feathers of seafowl and
cushioned deeply with ferns. Beneath
it the mist fell away a full three hundred feet,
and out of the void the seals bellowed on the
heels of the storm. There was another
sound, too. Scanlan had been crouching on
the ledge for a long time listening to those
faint, piteous cries that came intermittently
from the depths below. At each repetition,
his gaunt frame writhed and trembled with
oilcloth on the floor. It had cracked in a
unrestrained fear, and his hands clutched the
ferns with desperate strength. Finally, in
a gust of overwhelming terror, he rose and
fled into the forest, which showed stark
and black against the morning mists behind
him —a haven of safety.
It was almost dark in the forest. Be-
neath the roof of leaves the ground was
everywhere sodden and spongy. He ran on,
whimpering and cursing, until the forest,
slanting again to the sea, told him he had
crossed the island. Presently he reached the
seaward edge again; and there, in an open
space, overgrown with tall, purple flowers,
he liad his lair —a driftwood hut cunningly
built under the last low edge of the forest,
so that it was invisible alike from land and
sea. Still he did not stop, but staggered
down to the beach, and, dropping to his
knees above a pool, stared at what the
mirror-like surface returned to him. Keenly
searching his reflection, he scrutinised every
feature of his broad, rugged face, with its
shock of rust-red beard and its dark notice-
able eyes. Then, at sight of the livid scar
that stood out on his forehead, Scanlan’s
throat contracted in a strangled sob, and his
lips moved.
“Holy Virgin !” he whispered hoarsely. “I
daren’t! I daren’t! Even after all these
years there ain’t a soul irom Cooktown to
Perth who wouldn’t know me in a minute.”
In an agony of fear he crawled back to
the hut and lay with his fingers presised into
his ears, vainly trying to shut out the echoes
of that faint voice that cried ceaselessly and
compellingly for assistance. Presently In-
slept, but woke in a frenzy from the usual
dream.
“No, no!” ho cried, clawing at his throat.
“You ain’t goin’ ter serve me lnke you served
that Dago at Brisbane. I ain’t goin’ ter be
hanged! First an’ last. I'll keep me liberty
if it’s the last thing I ever do. Liberty,
that’s what I want, and that’s what I mean
ter keep. Keep away, curse you!” Again
he slept, panting and tossing on his heap
or dried ferns.
Within half an hour he was awake again
and running across the island like a mad-
man. Seabirds struck at him as he passed
their nests in the tussocks, but he stopped
for nothing in his fury of haste. Ilis face
was a battleground of longing and fear. He
wore a rude headgear fashioned from palm-
leaves and seaweed, which, when pulled
down ovel- his forehead, concealed the sear
that branded him for ever an outcast among
men.
That feeble crying had fallen silent long
before he reached the other beach ; but the
man’s body still lay on the fringe of the
undergrowth, where he had crawled from
the sea. Scanlan bent over him. lie handled
him reluctantly, but there was tenderness
in Scanlan’s eyes and an infinite longing in
the movements of his hands.
“W ot brought 'ini ’ere?" the voice cracked
discordantly. “P’raps 'e came 'ere to take
me back! Well, ’e ain't goin' to; I'll kill
'im first! They ain’t goin' ter take me
liberty away. Still, ’o mightn't know about
me; an' 'e is alive, thank God!"
With a strange expression of triumph in
his eyes, Scanlan gathered the body into his
great, bony arms, and, adjusting his burden,
crept away with it into the rising mists.
When Russell opened his eyes he was
stretched out in the hut, feeble, in pain and
helpless. Ilis right leg was padded with
dried fern-leaves and bound tightly into a
rude splint. Through the door of the hut lie
could see the Pacific glittering in the morn-
ing sun, and a spiral of seabirds that wheeled
and clamored noisily along the fringe of the
headland. The desolation worried him, and.
with the petulance of a sick man, lie cried
out hysterically. Ilis call was answered;
out. of the forest a gaunt figure broke eagerly
and came running towards the hut.
Scanlan entered the hut. and all sound
died in Russell’s throat at the sight of that
great, scarred body, worn as if by the wash
of tides. With widening eyes the sick man
noted the strange headgear, and, with sharp-
ening interest, took in the rugged features
that showed faintly through rust-red
whiskers.
“Hell!” was jerked from him at last.
“Where am I, and what are you?”
“You’re on the Razorback. mate.”
“Rut there's no man on the Razorback —•
if you’re a man.”
“I’m ’ere. an’ I’m a man."
Russell's gaze wandered; lie was very
weak.
“You saved me, then.” he murmured pre-
sently. “You heard me call.”
“Yes, I ’card you.”
Silence, filled only with the ceaseless sough-
ing of the breeze in the forest. Russell
snuggled into his fern-leaves.
“Christ!” he muttered wearily; then fell
asleep.
Throughout the day he slept. Rain pierced
the flimsy shelter, and all day Scanlan sat
sheltering him from the wet with his own
great body. lie was very still, but inwardly
lie was exultant, drugged with content to be
once more within sight and touch of a
fellow creature.
Russell woke towards nightfall. Scanlan
fed him with eggs, and presently the sick
man looked up with the light of returning
sanity in his eyes.
“Must have broken my leg.”
“Yes. ’Ow did yer git 'ere?”
“Washed overboard. Was steward on the
Leon Gambetta. and the skipper was trying
to push her past the Razorback in the teeth
of that yelling southerly.” His eyes, bright
as a bird’s, rested on Scanlan with a certain
nameless foreboding. “Been here long?”
“A fair while.”
“Swim ashore, like me?”
After a silence Scanlan answered heavily:
“Came in a boat.”
Russell started violently, then groaned
with pain. Scanlan had taken off his
clothes now, and shone in the dark with all
the red-haired man’s whiteness of skin. He
was naked save for the head-dress.
Hope blazed up in the little man’s soul.
“Boat? You came in a boat? Whv in
Hell don’t you go away in it then? Where
is if?”
“There’s some of it,” replied Scanlan,
pointing to the walls of their shelter. “The
rest of it I burnt.”
Russell shrank back on to his couch be-
wildered, the sudden hope extinguished in
a moment. He tried to speak again, but
words refused to come. Once more he was
weak, small, ill. Then, with an outburst
of childish fury, he raised himself on one
elbow and pointed to Scanlan’s headgear.
“Take that thing off your face,” ho
screamed harshly; and lapsed into uncon-
sciousness again.
Scanlan looked down upon him. “I ain’t
scared of ’im,” he said fiercely, with the air
of a man trying desperately to reassure him-
self. “’E ain’t dangerous.”
The next time Russell w’oke he was
stronger, and had recovered himself well. His
identity burned with a much clearer flame;
easily, after the manner of sick men. he
accepted the situation. He was grateful to
Scanlan, and full of wonderful plans for
their escape from the narrow confines of the
Razorback. An easy-going, talkative little
man; and Scanlan found his empty heart
warming every hour. The companionship
that the big man had hungered for w r as fully
satisfied, and he was content.
“What can we find to eat here?” Russell
asked him.
“Eggs, fish an’ young birds now an’ then;
there’s a sort of seaweed that’s good to eat,
too. The food ain’t fattenin’, but still it
could be worse.”
“Got a gun?”
“No.”
The little steward was silent. Presently
he glanced up, and his words came with
obvious difficulty.
“You’ve been very decent to me. Why?”
From the darkened corner of the hut Scan-
lan’s reply was barely audible: “Ain’t ’ad
a chance to entertain visitors ’ere before.
Reckon I get lonely sometimes.”
“We may be here a long time. Better be
friends, eh?”
“Yes, we’d best be friends.”
“Then why not take that damned thing
off your head, and let me have a good look
at the man that saved my life?”

A Fair Warning
One That Should Be Heeded by All
Frequently the first sign of kidney trouble is a slight
ache or pain in the loins. Neglect of this warning makes
the way easy for more serious troubles—gravel, dropsy,
rheumatism, and other serious forms of kidney disease.
Tis 1 well to pay attention to the first sign. Weak
kidneys generally grow weaker, and neglect is often

dangerous. People in Australia place reliance in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This tested remedy
has been used in kidney trouble for years, and is recommended all over the civilised world.
INTERESTING SYDNEY EVIDENCE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. S. Drew, 28 Briggs Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says: - : ‘Some
time ago my kidneys were in a seriously disordered state and in consequence
I suffered terribly. My back never stopped aching, and I was almost crippled
with the ailment. Dropsical swellings showed on my legs and ankles, and
there was puffiness under my eyes. The state of my health worried me
if, ' terribly, and as I had taken all sorts of remedies without deriving any
| benefit, I was beginning to think I would never be well again. However, at
i. I got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they proved a godsend. The
f i hrst couple of bottles eased my suffering a little, and seven bottles of the
pills cured me completely.”
Five years later Mrs. Drew says“l have had no return of my old
’ complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me over five years ago.”
A MAN’S CASE.
, Mr. Jas. C. Struck. Yugilbah, 4 Eurella Street, Burwood, Sydney, says:
“Seven years ago I was very ill with a bad attack of disordered kidneys. I
suffered excruciating agony from backache and was at times so bad that I
could hardly move. Everything I had to do w r as a trouble, and I was miser-
able and depressed. The kidney secretions were thick and cloudy and
contained a red sediment, and my ankles swelled to twice their usual size.
I went on suffering in this vray for a long time, nothing I took doing me any
good, but at last I got the right remedy, and that was Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. After taking two bottles of these Pills I felt much relieved,
and by the time I had finished eight bottles I was completely cured and felt
a different man.”
Ten years later Mr. Struck says:—“Thanks to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills I am still free.from backache and kidney trouble.”

Scanlan’s body stiffened, and during the
frozen silence that ensued Russell shut his
eyes in nameless fear. He opened them
again with a jerk to Scanlan’s words which
poured forth in savage confusion.
“Look at me, blast yer! ’Ave a good look
at me, if yer must. I keep me face ’id ’cause
it suits me, see? I busted that boat ’cause
I thought I’d be tempted to git away out of
’ere some day. Funny, ain’t it? You think
I’m mad to stop ’ere like a snake in an ’ollow
log. Well, think what you like! I stops
on the Razorback ’cause it’s the only place
on God's earth I can live.”
“I’m sorry, mate.” Russell’s words caused
the big figure to wheel around. “It’s not
my business, anyway.”
“Do you believe in Christ?” Scanlan hissed
the question out venomously.
Probing the depths of his mind, the little
steward found some unexpected strength
there, and replied: “Yes, I do!”
“Well, swear to me ’ere an’ now that,
when you git off this place, you’ll never let
a livin' soul know there was another man
’ere with you.”
He framed the oath, a terrible one enough,
and Russell took it without hesitation.
After a moment, he looked up with new-
found courage. “I’d have done what you
asked without being sworn,” he said, pur-
posefully. But Scanlan was gone.
Gone, drifting about the island that was
his world, blown like a wisp of weed between
the leaden sea and the forest. He stayed
away until his passion wore itself out. When
he eventually returned to the hut lie found
that the steward, thinking himself deserted,
had crawled as far as the beach, and was
stretched out there in a dead faint.
As Scanlan was carrying him back again,
Russell recovered, and clung to his rescuer
like a child.
“I thought you’d gone for good, and left
me, mate.”
“No, it’s you that’ll be took, an’ me that’ll
be left.”
“Who will take me?”
“There’s ships put in ’ere sometimes. I
’ide when they come.”
Russell looked at him curiously. “How
do you know I’ll keep that oath?”
“I’d kill yer if I thought yer wouldn’t.”
Scanlan was trembling like a leaf. “I nearly
left yer to die, as it was. Hours an’ hours
I _ ’card yer callin’ down there yesterday
without doin’ anything.”
“If you are so afraid of me why did you
save me?”
“Lonely,” said Scanlan vaguely. “Jes’
lonely, I reckon.”
The big man was worn out. Uncon-
sciously his hand sought Russell’s. To-
gether they huddled up, and when the little
man fell asleep a long while later, Scanlan
covered him up and sat beside him far into
the night.
* * * *
Under Scanlan’s ceaseless care, Russell
recovered his strength rapidly. With his
cheap and friendly chatter, his adaptability
and his shallow" optimism, he fed that gaunt,
starved spirit as food feeds a w T asted body.
Scanlan began to think himself not utterly
cast out, since he was allowed both freedom
and a friend. But the friend might not be
there long. Day after day Russell watched
the horizon, where at any hour might show
the rescuing stain of smoke. Seanlan
watched, too. Sometimes the thought came
to him that Russell was sure to tell what
he knew, and at such times he could see no
safety for himself while the little steward
lived. Then fear would seize him relent-
lessly, and drive him out of the hut into the
w T aste places of the island, where he endured
the same racking tortures, crouching in the
dark forest glades, and planning Russell’s
death. He would kill Russell. Yes, he
would be safe then. Safe —but lonely ! He
tried to picture the Razorback without his
new-found friend, and. with searing agony
in his heart, dreaded the inevitable coming
of the first ship.
Slowly the days passed, and Seanlan's
forebodings grew more and more insistent.
And then one night he saw a ship—an old
sailing-ship, beautiful in the full glory of
tne moon. She was working out against
the tide, and was almost under the shadow of
the cliffs. Seanlan thought he could have
tossed a stone on to her deck as she passed
slowly by. He heard the bark of a dog on
board, and threw himself face downwards in
the ferns. She was gone when he raised
his head. He was on the beach before
daybreak, feverishly searching the water-
line. A few half-peeled potatoes were all
he found. Carefully lie buried them deep in
the sand lest Russell might find them
and ask questions. The next ship came just
before _ sundown, a grimy tramp, doggedly
ploughing the vast green swells. Russell
lay sleeping in the hut, and, when the
steamer’s shrill whistle sounded, its echoes
cut into Scanlan’s heart like a knife. The
sleeping man stirred, and when he woke a
few minutes later the horizon through the
door of the hut was clear. Russell turned
over and went to sleep again.
Stealing down towards the sea. Seanlan
tried to order his chaotic thoughts. Vague
ideas came to him out of the turmoil of his
mind, and he caught at them desperately.
“If ’e goes it will be ’im that sees ther
ship. I ain’t goin’ ter tell ’im! If ’e sees
a ship ’e can go; I won’t ’inder ’im. I
lived without ’im before, an’ I can do it
again.” Then suddenly he bent his head
upon his bony knees, and wept with the
strangled intensity of a broken soul.
* * » *
“What is it, mate?”
Seanlan, roused from fitful slumber,
searched the excited face that was thrust into
liis own.
Rnssell dragged at his arm, and, without
speaking, led him to the door of the hut.
Under the lee of the penguin rocks a whaler
was at anchor.
“My God!” he screamed hysterically,
“don’t you see? It’s a ship, it’s men. it's
life! Quick, they may put off again. They
may miss us! Oh mate, for the love of
Christ, help me down to the beach, quick!”
Seanlan stood like a gnarled tree, motion-
less. Looking at him, the little steward's
jaw dropped. “You,” he mouthed—“you’re
not coming?”
Slowly, as if every movement was tor-
ture, Seanlan turned and faced him.
“ ’Avc another look at me, mate.” He
spoke very gently. “Ain’t you got no memory
left? Look at that scar on me ’each You
must er seen me photo in ther papers often
enough. Why, there ain’t a man from
Cooktown to Perth that don’t know me.
I’m ‘Butcher’ Scanlan, the man that killed
Anderson at Newcastle two years ago!”
Russell, dawning recognition in his eyes,
gaped at the big man helplessly.
“Now yer see why I can’t leave ’ere,” went
on Scanlan. “I ain’t safe anywhere where
there's men an’ women. I got ter stay on
ther Razorback, or be ’anged like a dog.
You ain’t scared of me, are yer?” he went
on with suffering in his eyes. “That’s wot
’urts. I shipped aboard a tramp at Sydney,
an’ less than two days out there wasn’t a
man on ther ship I could talk to. Treated
me like a leper. One man spat in my plate,
an’ when I struck ’im they ironed me, an’
was goin’ ter put me back ashore. But I
got away in a dinghy. They must ’ave
thought I was drowned, or I wouldn’t be safe
even ’ere. They’d ’unt me down like a dingo.
Everybody knows me—l can’t ’ide that sear.”
The little steward found speech at last.
“So you won’t come?”
“No. mate, as God’s me judge. I'd be
’anged in a month ; and now I’ve found liberty,
I ain’t goin’ to throw it away like that.”
Without a word Russell began to crawl
painfully down the slope towards the beach,
where a boat had put ashore, and men were
lounging on the sand.
Flat under the edge of the bushes, Scanlan
watched him through tear-dimmed eyes. His
great hands twitched, and with an iron de-
termination he suppressed the desire to run
and lielii the steward on his painful journey.
Absently he muttered directions that Russell
couldn’t possibly hear.
“Keep movin’ ter the right, mate. Easy,
now; mind them stones. There, you’ve ’urt
yerself again ! Take yer time, lad. There’s
no ’urry.”
Russell crawled on. inch by inch, his
maimed leg dragging clumsily behind him.
He was sick with agony, and beads of sweat
stood out on his forehead. He could see the
men on the beach gathering about the cutter
again. He called out, but his throat was
dry, and a hoarse croak was the only result.
In a paroxysm of mingled fear and'rage he
mouthed soundless curses. With a great
effort he moved ahead, gained a tussock,
passed a rock, and sank exhausted. Then
on again towards life and safety and every-
thing that made the world. He stole a
look at the boat below —a man was lifting
himself over the gunwale. Russel] screamed
again with no better result. His agony,
his prayers, his sufferings were as nothing.
He was alone between the merciless sky and
the merciless sea, all alone, and the boat
would not wait for him. A further attempt
to call out was strangled by the rising wind.
He struck savagely at the broken leg that
was his ruin : “I’m done. I can’t get down
there. I’m beat. I can’t make them hear.”
He burst into tears once more.
A shadow fell upon him, and he looked up.
Scanlan stood beside him, and as he met
Russell’s eyes he smiled gently.
“Everything’s right, mate.” There was a
mothering note in the big man’s voice as
he bent over the sufferer. “Never thought about
yer leg. Come on now, I’ll carry yer down”
Amid a great silence, a silence which even
the wind and the sea seemed to respect. Rus-
sell’s arms went around the neck of the man
who had killed Anderson at Newcastle.
Carrying his burden easily. Scanlan began
to run down the slope with mighty leaps.
His shouts burst the silence. The men
around the boat below looked up at the two
wonderingly.
Scanlan rushed on, shouting, with the little
steward sobbing silently in his arms.
W. D. FLANNERY.
A Materialist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN darkness brooded on the deep.
And all the earth was bond to fear
Of things unseen and powerful,
His sires saw Terror all too near.
The dread that gripped their quaking hearts
Has reached him in another form,
Warning, as distant bells toll near
In the dark hush before a storm.
Because his great-great-grandsire’s soul
Sickened at corpse-lights in the fens
And hedged itself with spells and charms
More tremblingly than other men’s,
He holds, he says, to solid things,
And eategoric’ly denies
The truth of what he cannot see.
Finding it good to shut his eyes.
Never a legend was so wild
But that it held some errant touch
Of life; but this man doubts of all
Because his kind believed too much.
Never a medicine-man so false
But that, amid his pattering,
Once in a while his lying lips
Were brushed by Truth’s impartial wing.
But this man, lest the faithful earth
Should once again beneath his feet
Fail as it did in ages past,
Shuns certain hidden things and sweet,
Denying all beyond man’s grasp,
Though in man’s blood; “for,” reasons he,
“If neither God nor Devil were,
How Very safe a man might be!”
His hag-rid ancestors that heard
Warlocks and witches on the blast
Have cheated him of many joys;
Their voices warn him from the past,
And with protective eommonsense
He turns from paths that smile to us,
And will not play with thoughts of fauns,
Remembering them as dangerous.
So. fettered by the fear of fear,
His fancy runs not free like ours;
Lest there be demons in the rocks.
He sets no fairies in the flowers.
There’s much in him one must admire,
And that which interests us most
Is the defiant voice of dread
With which he’ll speak about a ghost.

SATISFACTION
with oneself—the knowledge that you have
succeeded where perhaps others have failed—
such satisfaction is good. A bright optimistic
temperament and calm mental poise fit an
individual for doing his or her best. Such a
sound, healthy state of mind is rendered
difficult, if not impossible, when a person is
troubled with digestive disturbances. Tired-
ness, that languid, heavy feeling, is the result
of stomach, bowel and liver irregularities. A
few doses of Beecham’s Pills, however, will
regulate the organs to healthy activity.
