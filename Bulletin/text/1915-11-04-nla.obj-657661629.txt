The Red Page
Belgian Poems
by Emile Cammaerts
THE BELGIAN FLAG.
Red for the blood of soldiers,
Black, yellow and red —
Black for the tears of mothers,
Black, yellow and red —
And yellow for the light and flam «.
Of the fields where the blood is shedl
To the glorious flag, my children,
Hark! the call your country gives ,
To the flag in serried orderl
He who dies for Belgium lives!
Red for the purple of heroes,
Black, yellow and red —-
Black for the veils of widows.
Black, yellow and red —
And yellow for the shining crown
Of the victors who have bled!
To the flag, the flag, my children,
Hearken to your country's cryl
Never has it shone 1 so splendid,
Never has it flown so high !
Red for the flames in fury,
Black, yellow and red —
Black for the mourning ashes,
Black , yellow and red —
Ana yellow of gold, as we proudly hail
The spirits of the dead!
To the flag, my sons! Your country
With her blessing, “Forward!” cries!
Has it shrunken? No, when smallest,
Larger, statelier, it flies!
Is it tattered? No, ’tis stoutest
When destruction it defies! .
THE ASS AND THE OX.
“illoo, shut the door, who comes here?
It is cold, and the night is drear,
Who comes here ?”
“ Hehaw , ’tis only I, my brother,
’Tis only we —a mother,
A man , and soon a Child.”
“What gleams above the roof so cleart
Will yon not shut the door?”
“It is the Star, 'tis stopping here."
“Who is singing up aloft?”
“The choir of angels with voices soft.”
“Who moaneth, 'neath the straw’s poor
coverf”
“The Holy Virgin Mother.”
“Who is moving over there?”
“The man takes off my load with care.”
“Moo, and now, my brother mild,
Hear you—see you nothing there?”
“'Tis a little naked child
Playing with his pink toes bare.”
“Moo, open the door, for I can hear
Kings and shepherds drawing near,
Coming to adore him.”
“Hehaw, all’s icell, the Star is gleaming,
Open wide the dpor.
The Child is laughing.”
THE CHILD.
With closed eyes and arms across,
With head below and feet above,
He dreams of this world as we dream of the
next,
With greater innocence, faith and love.
He listens and looks, without hearing or
seeing,
He waits in the night for the dag to arise.
Patiently, nothing asking,
He troubles not, but cahnlg lies
With folded arms, hands, and parted lips,
And sleeps, of glad to-morrows dreaming.
Oh rest in God, as he rests in you,
With the same firm faith, quiet and true,
Rest then in God and calmly dream
Of the stars and the choir of blessed souls,
As he dreams of a flower, or bird, or stream.
THE CHILD.
Sit by me and let us talk.
Tell me tchcre you have spent the night,
Beneath what sky, beneath what roof,
With what friends bright?
Did you meet the fairy host
That haunts your garden knollsf
Or were you altogether lost
Among your crowd of toys and dolls?
Where were you when you sucked your
thumb?
What did you when you murmured lowt
Were yon flying on a pigeon's wing
Over the trees, or did you sing
Across the smooth wide river floating,
On your red balloon a-ridingt
Did you fear a shipwreck nigh
When you began to cry.
Or could you not find, in your hand
The white mouse, Mab's gift from Fairyland?
Or else did you fear
That. Baby Jesus sweet,
Who is ever near,
Had cold little feci?
O mysterious soul of my little child!
I am ashamed I can but guess so ill,
I blush to be so big and tall
Beside my baby small.
From “Belgian Poems, Chants Patri-
otlques et Autres Pohmes, par Emile Cam-
maerts” (Lane, per Sydney Book Club).
Though overshadowed by the mighty fame
of Verhaeren, Emile Cammaerts is one of the
leading Belgian poets. The selections from
his work printed in Belgian Poems include
both the French text and its translation;
but the translations, as will be seen from the
war poems quoted, are clumsy. The deli-
cate naiveness and child-like limpidity of out-
look is irremediably blurred by the transla-
tor’s fumbling hand; but enough survives,
especially in the series of poems about the
child, to adumbrate these charming charac-
teristics. There could be but little bitter-
ness in the soul of Cammaerts even when
writing poems of Belgium’s agony. These
patriotic poems are pour la pipe da soldat- ■ —
Here I have laid my heart all bare,
Without veils or bars,
That they may smoke one pipe the more
Beneath the stars.
Thus he speaks of his King:—
King of but a. hundred fields
And of twenty village spires.
He has no fierce Verhaeren invective for
the Huns. All that his bitterness will per-
mit his gentle soul to say is:—
I wish that you may live to feel
All we have suffered of late,
So that God may spare you the punishment
supreme—
His eternal vengeance and hate.
Instead, he sings of Easter —Easter and
the' spring:—
It is spring in Brussels, too,
And Easter at the front
’Tis Easter, the guns are roaring
And the light gnats dance.
*Tis Easter, choirs arc raising
Hymns of delivers i.ee—
We will break our chains
As tliou brokest Thy tomb.
We’ll conquer our plains
As Thou conquered’st Death—
’Tis Easter, the shells fly
In the clear spring air.
’Tis Easter, upon every cross'
A bird sings his refrain.
’Tis Easter, the grass grows,
Christ is risen again!
Fiction
Stijn Streuvels is accepted in Belgium
and Holland as the most distinguished low-
Dutch author of our time. He writes in the
West-Flemisli dialect, which is spoken by a
million people in West Flanders, including
such now well-known towns as Bruges,
Ghent, Ostend and Ypres. The translator
of The Path of Life (Allen and Unwin;
55.), states that this dialect is one of the
richest in words expressive of human charac-
teristics and of physical sensations. “There
is a word to describe what we feel when we
hear the tearing of silk or the ripping of
calico, a word that tells what we really feel
in our hair when we pretend that it ‘stands
on end.’ ” Stijn Streuvels first made his
living as a village baker; and the stories in
this volume belong to that period of his life.
The effect of this collection of stories is
monotonous, because his subject is monot-
onous. The author tells of the deadly same-
ness of the life of the farm laborer, little
higher in intellect than the farm-beasts. In
one of these delicately-written sketches he
pictures a cow-herd, a growing youngster,
going home on Sunday. “He thought.... of
what? Of nothing! Truly, of nothing:
what does a cowherd think of? Wait a bit,
though ;he was thinking: ’Twas Sunday !
It was Sunday once more, the glad Sunday.
And there were so few Sundays in those
long, long weeks. And lie was going home
for a few hours: yes, home; and from there
to Stafke’s and to Staflce’s pigeons.” And
when he got home all he did was to go and
sit in the pigeon-loft with his chum Stafke
and watch the pigeons. Yet, simply and art-
lessly the author manages to convey to the
reader that in this stolid staring at the
pigeons the cowherd somehow glimpsed a
little of the beauty of the world.
The same weary, incessant struggle for
existence, endured with the same animal-like
stolidity, is led by the working-class of the
towns. “An Accident” describes with a
wonderful psychology the mind of a poor
workman, who, after a bout of drinking, has
to carry bricks to the roof of a great build-
ing. “It seemed to him sometimes that the
whole mass of walls and scaffolding, laborers
and foremen made but a single being: a sort
of fearsome deity, something like an un-
wieldy monster with inhuman, cruel feelings,
something which bad to be fed with all that
workmen’s sweat; and all this feverish
activity seemed to him the whirling along of
a crowd of unfortunates who had stepped
into the fatal circle marked out for them,
never to leave it again.” This workman
leaves the circle; he leaps out of it. The
“accident” is described with an almost sick-
ening realism.
The story “Spring” shows this author’s
strange powers at their height. There is
hardly a suggestion of a plot in any of his
stories. Here Stijn Streuvels merely discloses
for us the innocent mind of a devout young
peasant girl preparing for her confirmation.
It is a white, idyllic pastoral, in which the
young child’s intense spirituality is sternly
contrasted with the prosaic minds of her
parents. The great event of the girl’s life,
so eagerly looked forward to, comes and
goes. Then the girl has to go to work
with the other peasants in the fields of
their sinister master. And the story ends
with the hint that this innocent child must
be sacrificed, as other of the girls had been
sacrificed, to their master’s lust. In Stijn
Streuvels* stories life often appears as a
shrieking blasphemy. The last story, “The
End,” tells with the horrible realism of Tol-
stoy of the death of an old peasant. Also, of
his old widow sleeping that night in the same
bed with the corpse and having at last
to get out of bed and open the window on
account of the smell! Stijn Streuvels spares
his readers nothing.
Jt
“Ole Luk-Oie,” the author of that remark-
able- collection of war-stories, The Green
Curve, is stated to be the chief “Eyewit-
ness” with French in Flanders. The repu-
tation he has made with his first volume is
hardly dimmed by his second, The Great Tab
Dope (Blackwood). For there are three
stories in this collection, the title story, “The
Sense of Touch” and “The Culvert on the
Summit,” that are nearly as good as the
best of his earlier volume. “The Great Tab
Dope” is the story of a daring and ingenious
bluff by means of which a Yankee subaltern
in an irregular engineer corps at the Boer
war managed to get certain indispensable
bridging material to hand without the usual
delay of military red tape. He discovered
that the one thing to do was to bluff. In-
geniously he adds to his uniform colorable
imitations of the insignia of a staff-officer.
“If you show a red streak round your hat
and two spots on your collar you’ll chloro-
form the crowd. I’ve seen enough on this
journey to discover that they are the great
dope of the ’hull British army. Anyone
without ’em is hoodooed all the time.” The
story is delightfully told, in a manner remin-
iscent of the Kipling that was. “The Sense
of Touch” might have been written by the
Wells that was. The narrator is present at
a moving-picture show where he sees a well-
known film depicting a duel to the death
between a praying mantis and a scorpion.
The insects are shown on the screen enor-
mously magnified; and the horrible death-
struggle, infinitely more interesting than a
prize-fight, is, in the story; made more real
by appeals to other senses than the visual.
The sounds of the struggle are magnified to
correspond with the enormously enlarged
photographs; and an unseen apparatus gives
forth the similarly intensified disgusting
odor of the combatants. The lecturer re-
grets that he is unable to appeal to the only
other sense, the sense of touch. For the
sense of taste is included in that of smell.
However, he hopes some day that this will
be possible. And the impossible happens:
the sense of touch of the audience is dramati-
cally appealed to. The film stops—and the
huge insect monsters leap into the audience.
What happens then is told with horrible
detail. The third story is a grim snake story,
in which a man has to fight an invasion of
cobras in the dark.
The book “dates.” “Ole Lulc-Oie’s” con-
ception- of war is already prehistoric: all
these war-stories were written before we
knew Avhat real war was. An aeroplane
story that two years ago might have been a
brilliant forecast of aerial strategy has
already been proved to be absurd. But the
author’s facilities for seeing the real thing
at close hand will probably enable him to
add to his reputation another and greater
reputation. “Ole Luk-Oie” can write.
What is the Best Australian
Short-story?
The Dial, a Chicago fortnightly, set out
on the quest of the best short stories in. the
world. It found 14. First, it formulated
its rules for selection. The short story
should be unitary; it has hardly room for
character or development of character: it
is not who acts, but xvliat happened, that is
important. Theme, incident and setting are
the prime requisites. It should have univer-
sality; it must be accepted by all languages.
It must be original; it must do something
for the first time, or something better than
it ever has been done before. And it should
be the key to open a door to new vistas of the
mind.
The Dial’s chief demand is universality.
The selection is: “Aladdin.” “The Sleeper
Awakened” and “Ali Baba,” from The
Arabian Nights —closely wrought in incident
and scene, accepted all over the world, and
imi cated and reproduced in many forms;
“Federigo and His Falcon,” from Boccaccio
—“the highest and purest note of any piece
on our list”; “Peter Schlemihl” (the man
who lost his shadow), by Chamisso—one of
the few world-tales in German literature;
“Undine,” by Fourque ; and “Paul and Vir-
ginia,” by Ste Pierre, both rather too long;
“Wandering Willie’s Tale,” debarred from
its rightful fame because it is embedded in a
novel; Irving’s “Rip Van Winkle”; Steven-
son’s “A Lodging for the Night” ; “The Gold
Bug,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue”
and “The Fall of the House ot' Usher,” “not
because they are the best things in Poe’s
prose, but because they are his best stories,
and because they have led the whole world to
follow and imitate them”; and Bret Harte’s
“The Luck of Roaring Camp,” for its new
view.
The partially or wholly disqualified in-
clude many of Boccaccio’s after-dinner
stories, because they are merely briefly-told
incidents; Baron Munchausen, who is too
brief or too derivative; Merimde’s “Carmen,”
not universal enough;. Maupassant, whose
stories are more like epigrams, and have not
yet sunk deeply into the world’s mind; Mrs.
Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” because the story
is badly written; Bulwer’s “The Haunted
and the Haunters,” “perhaps the best ghost
story written” because it is too lacking in
humanity; Dickens, George Eliot, Meredith,
Frank Stockton. O. Henry, Bierce. Kipling,
Wells, Zola are not even mentioned!
Four of the winners deal with the super-
natural, two others deal with the marvellous;
one, “The Sleeper Awakened,” is a tale of
pure humor and human nature; “Federigo
and His Falcon” and “Paul and Virginia”
are stories of young love and devotion; “The
Gold Bug” is the exemplar of all possible
treasure stories; Stevenson’s story is the
type of the nomad and vagabond species;
“The Fall of the House of Usher’’ gives us
intellect dominant and in ruin, with nature
sympathising with it; Bret Harte gives us
primitive and adventurous life; and “The
Murders in the Bue Morgue” launched the
detective in fiction. The Dial ventures the
opinion that these themes comprise the whole
of the main strands of short-story weaving.
It is worthy of remark that no Australian
short-story writer appears in even the list
of competitors. Have we no Australian
short-story of world-importance? The search
might be worth while. Will the readers of
this page kindly collaborate? A reward of
one guinea will be offered for the discovery
of the best half-dozen short-stories published,
either in periodicals or in books, in Austral-
asia.
The method adopted for this plebiscite
will be as follows: Each entrant must for-
ward a list of Australasian short-stories, not
exceeding six, with names of authors, and,
if possible, some identification of place of
publication. It is not necessary to name six
stories. Each story so named will receive
one vote; and the poll will ultimately
show six stories elected in their order. To
win the guinea all you have to do is to make
your little list correspond with the popular
choice. If two competitors succeed in
naming the whole six, then the prize will
be given to the one who more nearly places
the names in the order at the declaration
of the poll. Therefore place your own selec-
tions in order of merit. Entries must reach
this page by December 10.

In the September issue of that useful but
somewhat pontifical Imperial quarterly,
The Round Table, the financial task con-
fronting England is exhaustively analysed
“Side by side with the armed struggle in
the field there is going on another silent,
invisible struggle which in the end may be
equally decisive —the struggle of exhaus-
tion.” And the need of national and indi-
vidual economy is rightly stressed. Tin-
nations that will come out best in this
struggle will be the nations that can find
within themselves the means of continuing
the fight, and have learnt by self-discipline
and organisation to direct all their energies
towards the war, to eschew all production
and all expenditure on luxuries and inessen-
tials. If a nation has to buy from abroad, it
must pay for what it buys, either by goods,
gold or securities. If it has to import more
than it can expoxd, the time will come when
that nation will wait unsatisfied in the rain
on the bleak doorstep of neutral financiers.
Its credit will have gone. A man, or a
nation, that buys what he or it cannot pay
for becomes a bankrupt. What is Australia
doing? Is she producing, by our individual
efforts, sufficient to pay for her imports? Is
she cutting off frills and excrescences like
politicians, bookmakers, State Governors,
and the importers of Paris “models” from
Japan, so that she can turn the unproduc-
tive energies of these people into our chief
business of conducting the war?
In discussing the large, vague subject of
the end of war, the w’riter points out
that: “The whole world has been dominated
by a national bigotry, not unlike the religious
bigotry which deluged the world in blood a
few centuries ago, in its cynical indifference
to all that did not affect itself.” Each State
has kept itself shut up in its own water-
tight compartment, remaining indifferent to
what went on outside its borders, and ready
with but one argument —armed force. All
war is therefore civil war. After a con-
sideration of the profound obstacles that lie
in the way of the creation of a World State,
the writer says : “The British Commonwealth
is a perfect example of the eventual world
commonwealth. It is one State in which one
law is supreme... .It contains more than a
quarter of mankind and more than a quarter
of the surface of the earth. Its peoples are
in every stage of development... .It is able
to give fair play even among its governing
communities to differences of race, and to a
vigorous and healthy nationalism... .All the
four self-governing Dominions have been
able to develop a national consciousness and
pride, not less strong, though far less bigoted,
than that of France -or Germany, and yet
find it compatible with membership of a
greater State. It is only a question of time
for these nations, without sacrificing one jot
or tittle of their own autonomy, to assume
their share of the responsibility for directing
the policy of the Commonwealth as a whole.
What is already a fact for a typical section
of mankind is ultimately possible for all
mankind.” So, maybe, we are greater than
we know: in working out our own destiny
we are but making and oiling and testing the
.machinery for the federation of the world.

Diogenes
believed
the worst
Cynical, sceptical, selfish, dis-
courteous ; even at this distance
it is no job to diagnose Diogenes.
He said he was looking for an
honest man, but he was not even
honest with his own liver. It
wanted to do its work. It wanted
so much to clear the poisons of
gloom and bitterness out of
his blood and his thoughts. It
yearned to make him see the
good side of the world and of
humanity. But did Diogenes
help it ?
No. He was one of those
people w r ho treat their liver
as an enemy, and refuse to
believe its intentions are good.
Probably he punished and in-
jured it with violent pills or
morning draughts. Anyone can
be a Diogenes by doing that, and
accumulating a stock-in-trade of
gloomy, bitter little toxins in his
blood. But who wants to be a
Diogenes ? Far wiser to live in
friendly partnership with one’s
liver and give it, now and then, the
gentle, natural, welcome help of

The Nerve Medicine
for
Professional People
is
CLEMENTS
TONIC
There are certain classes of pro-
fessional duties that worry the nerves
because of the strain upon them,
dental work particularly. This testi-
mony to Clements Tonic has been re-
ceived from Miss M. Griffith, Mar-
rickville Road, who has for a number
of years been associated with profes-
sional dental surgeons as assistant,
and her opinion is, iu consequence, of
a valuable nature. She writes,
12/3/M5
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“Owing to the trying professional nature of my duties in dental
surgery, I found myself at times very much run down and nervous.
Although never in real bad health, yet 1 had need of a good medicine, and
I found in Clements Tonic a splendid ‘weak-nerve remedy’ and promoter
of appetite.
“Whenever I need it I use it, and always find the greatest benefit
from its use.
“You may use this testimonial as vou wish.”
“(Signed) MISS M. GRIFFITH.”
Never be without this medicine if you are run-down or have Weak Nerves,
Bad Digestion, Poor Appetite, or Constipation. It tones up the human system
rapidly.
In cases where the nerves are shattered through exhaustive business studies,
fever, influenza, wasting illness or brain fag, this medicine is beneficial in its
results in*, regenerating nerve power. It is declared to be rich in those health-
creating properties that ensure bodily health and strength.
All Chemists and Stores sell it everywhere. Get it to=day and get well.


Australia Riddled with
Deadly Kidney Disease
ALMOST EVERYBODY COMPLAINING.
Kidney disease is most certainly on the in-
rrease. Thousands and thousands of people
in the towns and villages of this country are
in terrible danger of deadly kidney disease.
This insidious disease creeps on, gradu-
ally getting a firmer and firmer grip, until
when it is too late the poor sufferer discovers
he has Bright's Disease. Have you kidney
trouble? Do you know how to recognise
whether you are suffering from this or not?
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney
disease: Aches and pains in various parts of
the body, nasty taste in the mouth first thing
in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, puffiness under the eyes—
these are all symptoms of kidney trouble.
And then people who suffer from backache,
rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone or
pains in the bladder, muscles and joints are
all suffering these pains through weak or
diseased kidneys, for these are the sure and
certain symptoms of kidney trouble.
All these things mean that the kidneys are
weak and diseased. They need strengthening
and making healthy.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your

box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for' kidney and
bladder troubles.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid of
the cause—the poisonous uric acid. Itemem-
ber to do this a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder and not
through the bowels, as most kidney pills do.
When you see the urine change to a muddy
bluish color—a feature which distinguishes
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from all
others—you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right
spot—the kidneys and the bladder. A won-
derful pill —straight to the kidneys—that is
why De Witt’s Pills give such amazingly
quick relief—every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that
blue-colored urine.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nerv'ous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

A Reflection.
With stones that lie by easy roads
We make the walls of Hell;
And while we think we dawdle, still
We build them fast and well.
The careless act is still the tool,
The careless thought the crane,
With which unconsciously we form
The prisons or our pain.
Though some with riches’ show can mask
The Hell in which-they live,
Some with a forced, hysteric laugh
A show of joyance give,
We feel the prisons that we make,
That mar and cramp our lives;
The scourge is heavy on our hearts;
Our spirits feel their gyves.
What use to blame the silent gods?
The laws are straiglitly set.
Of small avail the prayer or curse,
The sigh of vain regret.
And, for my part, could I re-shape
My destiny ill-wrought,
My heart would pause, lest it might lose
Some treasure dearly bought.
For in the rocks that I have piled
Around my lot —once free—
I seek and iind the flow’rs of joy
That still are sweet to me.
And when, as from a landlord, I
From my poor prison flit,
I’ll trust my kinder friends to think
I made the best of it.

“Oh, who was he went whistling by
And who was he who passed to-night?”
“Sleep, lass, the wind is in the sky,
And I will latch your window tight!”
“The cows have paltered down the lane
And all the air is warm and still;
But whose the step came back again
And paused beneath the window-sill?”
“Best, girl, it is the pleasant sound
Of apples mellow with the sun,
And on the fragrant garden-ground
Are falling, falling, one by one.”
“Who is it calls to me to-night
And stands, a shadow in the shade?
Oh is it good an’ is it right?
O mother, mother, I’m afraid.”
“Peace, child, the moon is fair to see—-
A wonder-moon that bravely strode
And grapped yon crooked apple tree
And flung its shadow on the road !”
“Oh, tell me, mother, tell me, dear,
Why nightly to my heart will creep
A little joy which turns to fear
So that I sob myself to sleep?”
“Go rest ye, loved one, it is nought!
Some joyous thought, some tender word,
That in your Innocence is caught
And struggles like a prisoned bird.
“Good-niglit! I’ll smooth the rumpled sheet.
Good-night! my kiss is on your lip.
And many a golden dream, my sweet,
Is waiting on your pillow-slip !”

And hear him croon his sweet refrain
In soothing accents low and deep—

I dreamed last night that you came back to
me,
In all youf wondrous beauty as of old.
When we two sojourned in a land of gold,
Happy, not knowing ill things soon to be.
Yet through the radiance might I dimly see
Writ on your brow a mystery untold,
Knowledge of wonders man may not
behold
Before he brave the illimitable sea.
And now I know you will come back no
more.
That far horizon you have overpassed
Must hide you from my longing, till at last
I too shall venture forth into the night.
Nor may you heed me where I walk the shore.
Dazed with the wonder of a lost delight.

WHAT a marked difference there is
between the fretful, puny, ailing infant,
and the child whose face always bears
the smile and look of perfect health and con-
tentment. Mothers should early realize that much
depends on How Baby is Fed. The right food
given at the proper age means rest and comfort
for the mother and a sound healthy constitution
for her little one in after years. If, for any
reason, Baby cannot be given the natural food,
do not select a substitute merely because it is
cheap in price. Adopt what experience has
proved to be the Simplest and Most Successful
Method of Infant Feeding, i.e., The ‘Allenburys’
Foods. These Foods provide a Pure, Complete and
Progressive Dietary specially adapted to each
stage of a child’s development. They are not
expensive to buy when judged by the uniform good
results which follow their use; this is the true

ARMS AND THE DREAMER.
The German military authorities have been
expressing their wonder at the genius of the
big French general who, after months of
quiet preparation, recently administered a
wallop to their forces in Champagne of such
virulence that its sting is still smarting on
the sagging Teuton jaw and sending cold
shivers to the Teuton feet. Joffre’s quality
they recognise; but while the British soldier
.is felt to be unwholesome to German life,
Berlin has no speci'al bouquets to throw at
British generalship as it has so far been
revealed. This want of appreciation may be
merely due to the regular Gott strafe routine ;
but, again, it may be based on solid fact.
The British leader is all right as a leader.
Nobody unblinded by prejudice has any sort
of doubt about that. He may also be all
right as a director of operations and as a
strategist; but if he is, it must be in spite
of his training and of the system of which
he is a part. The first requirement of a
great war-maker who can plan vast and
startling things, and when up against an
apparently impossible task find means to
make it possible, is imagination. Your
Alexanders, Nelsons, Napoleons and the
like were all, first and foremost, men who
had that quality of resource. Pit your
mathematician against your dreamer in a
game of action mixed with chance, where
there are few data to work from and no reli-
able formulae by which to calculate, and
unless your dreamer is too lazy to put his
notions into practice he must beat the mathe-
matician every time. But the British army
system, as we have hitherto known it, tries
to eliminate the dreamer, to smarten and
cheapen him into something else. That is
why there are fine British leaders controlling
things with a mathematical precision of
discipline. It is also why those leaders so
seldom develop into generals of the first
magnitude.
» # *
In the vivid days following the first French
Revolution men of imagination got the swift
opportunity of putting their dreamings to
the test. In a few months a linen-draper or
a clerk who had been a hopeless, mooning
duffer, could leap from the ranks of that
effervescent Gallic army to a foremost place,
and throw his fancy and his soul into mili-
tary movements that outwitted, puzzled and
destroyed the rigid, mechanical systems
opposed to him. Napoleon himself rose at
a bound from being a junior officer of artil-
lery to a seat on the central horse of an
army’s staff. Even to day in countries like
Russia, where grand dukes and princes of
the Imperial family are by right of birth
big guns in the army, imagination can find
some scope. These men are not chained to
routine until their minds have lost their
buoyancy, and their imagination has gone
wing-lame. They learned their drill, it is
true, but they were not compelled to live for
dreary years between the covers of a drill-
book ; and, as a result, they can still see
things in masses, and dream of huge move-
ments which may count for more than all
the enemy’s guns. In Germany, as far as
we can judge, Wilhelm does the dreaming,
and has done so for years; and his heavy and
painstaking subordinates have been all the
time turning his dreams into the steel
machinery of war, until when the hour came
for letting his ugly imaginings out to blood
themselves they went with a fringe of super-
heated Hell-fire to aid their owner’s ambi-
tious purpose. In democratic France there
is still some elasticity of military thought,
though not enough for the national salvation;
and the emergence of Joffke and one or two
others at the right time must be counted
among those great strokes of luck which are
like the turning up of three sixes when the
gambler has staked his last pair of trousers
on the throw. The English system has
hitherto been the most rigid of all; and if
in spite of it great generals should arise with
their sleeves full of surprises and their
brains sizzling with military ideas, it will be
a proof that the age of miracles is still with
us rather than an indication that England
goes to work in the right way. Everybody
recognises Ivitcheneb as a great organiser;
Fbench and a dozen others can be pointed
to as leaders after the nation’s own heart.
More than this we cannot yet say with truth
or confidence.
• * * *
And here we come face to face with the
great paradox of the whole game of war.
The soldierly qualities, as they are called,
are of no use to the perspn who is in supreme
command; and the man who has the vivid
brain to plan the lightning stroke which
flashes clean through to victory is the last
person in the world to be attracted by the
dull routine of military life in time of peace.
The truth may go even farther than this.
If it is to be believed that genius and mad-
ness lie close together, that. Alexander
wore a diseased brain under his battle hat
and that Napoleon was an epileptic whose
malady worked itself out in strange forms,
it is pretty clear that our modern army
would reject as unfit the very men who
could put its legions on the path of certain
victory. Your great strategist who has the
imagination needed for the biggest task of
war may, in point of fact, be a sick person
of cowardly instincts and slovenly habits,
whose mere presence in a British regiment
would drive a drill-sergeant crazy, and whom
six months in an ordinary training camp
would put in an insane asylum or a neg-
lected grave; and yet this very man may be
worth 25 army corps, 500 12in. guns
and several millions of shells in such a
crisis as has now arisen in Europe. So dis-
tinct is the ability to manoeuvre armies and
plan campaigns from the actual work of the
field and the direct leadership of men that
it almost seems as if the key to the paradox
should he in the appointment and training of
two separate classes of officers. But a little
consideration will show that even this would
be of small benefit. The main difficulty lies
in the fact that great generalship, being so
much a matter of imagination and instinct,
is rather dwarfed and restricted than de-
veloped by any training—except perhaps that
of actual practice; and battle practice with
real guns and blood is too costly except
when a Kaiser or other dangerous animal
gets loose.
* * * *
Yet paradoxical as the profession of arms
may be, and difficult as the problem of find-
ing the right brains to command an army, in
the solution of this very riddle lies the hope
of the few against the many. Australians in
the defence of this continent are practically
certain to be compelled to meet the invader
on most unequal terms. Not only must we
have the organisation and machinery of war,
coupled with the courage which we have
come to take for granted, but we must have
the man. By what alterations in our pre-
sent system do we stand the best chance, of
finding him? This is one of the most im-
portant of our national problems. We have
certainly plenty of imagination of sorts.
Poets who dream dreams and drink beer and
then dream different dreams, are quite plenti-
ful ; but to put the direction Of our armies
in the field into the hands of a poet would be
—well, rather risky. Such a commander
would almost certainly do the unusual thing,
and it might be the surprise of the world;
but unless that surprise were of a kind dam-
aging to the enemy there would not be much
in it. Yet the problem is a live one, and its
importance is accentuated when we remem-
ber that the man who has wide experience
in the strategy of written ideas is quite as
likely to handle a campaign with success as
the man who has had a strict training in the
routine of leadership, but has no experience
of any sort of strategy. The great Marl-
borough is said to have learned his skill as
a general from long practice in the intrigues
of a decadent Court. It was an unlikely
school, but it served. Putting aside all pre-
conceived ideas as to the profession and prac-
tice of arms, the one fact that there is no
side-stepping is that Australia has somehow
or other to find a means by which the men
necessary to her safety shall be able to get
to the box seat of her military coach in the
quickest possible time. We may not be able
to get the great genius we require, but we
must have enough elasticity in our system to
allow the likely men available to get through.
We cannot make great commanders, and
there is no sure arrangement by which they
can be found when wanted ; but we can at
least avoid following methods which make it
certain that we shall never find them.
THE FALLACY OF EXPLORING AN
ASH-HEAP TO FIND A FINGER-
POST.
Though such profundities have nothing to
do with the matter, anti-national service bar-
rackers in Australia have amazing confi-
dence in such observations as
The nations of the ancient world pinned their faith
to force, and force had ultimately destroyed them.
They seem to believe that such remarks have
some vague, historical weight, and leave the
other side without a leg to stand on. Of
course, it would be just as reasonable to
quote, as an argument against personal clean-
liness, the awful fate of John Smith, who
pinned his faith to the shower-bath and
caught a cold in the head. The real point
at issue nowadays is not what happened to
someone or other away back in the Dark
Ages, of which the records are mostly eaten
by moths, but what may occur right on the
spot and be reported in the newspapers. As
a matter of fact, many ancient nations pro-
bably came a cropper through the local in-
habitant keeping his cow in the kitchen and
a hotbed in the drawing-room for cultivat-
ing the bacilli of cholera, tetanus, tubercle
and mumps. There is, at any rate, no
evidence to the contrary, and a whole
heap of reasonable inference exists to
justify the theory. Moreover, such evi-
dence as there is about nations pin-
ning their faith to force and thereby nour-
ishing within their bosoms the serpent of
sudden death is open to great suspicion.
Quite a number pinned their faith to' all
sorts of other things—the sacred buffalo,
and the peacock, and Confucius, and
Buddha, and the tortoise, and the moon, and
the interior of a bull. One of them pinned
its faith to the digging of a human heart
from where it belonged, and bowing down
before it. And all of these nations went
down with the others.
* . * * #
Scraps torn from the reflections of an
alleged historian and dumped down as contri-
butions to controversy relating to circum-
stances wholly different are worthless. The
reasons for the rise and fall of different
civilisations, for the growth and decay of
peoples and nations, are not to be found in
a hand-book, all packed up in a sentence like
a tabloid of concentrated earthly experience,
so to speak. Scores of influences have been
at work to account for these things, and they
have ranged from a man running away with
a maid to the expansion of geographical
knowledge, the use of metals and the influ-
ence of climate. The Roman was addicted to
the use of arms, and the fate of Rome before
the flood of Goths and Vandals is commonly
held up as the classic illustration of the
trouble that awaits a nation which employs
“force.” Yet nothing could easily be more
absurd, for whatever may be said about
Rome —and the number of things that have
been said defy computation—it is not to be
disputed that the Roman Empire flourished
to the great benefit of the human race, and
that if the Roman people had not been
ready and able to defend themselves their
ideals and great civic virtues would never
have flourished at all. Those ancient nations
carried on business at a time when the
world was full of savages, and to ask people
living nowadays to swallow the story that if
the old-timers had only been sufficiently
enlightened to adopt the principles of the
Peace Society they would be still holding the
fort —living exemplars of the mighty truth
that the community which is not prepared to
hit back endures for ever —is to present some-
thing wildly grotesque. The only individuals
this paper has any record of who ran the
show on a non-resistance platform were the
old Mexicans and the Tncas of Peru, and one
day two or three strangers came along and
the end of the world arrived. About the
only people in the world now who can be
quoted as illustrations of the great advan-
tage to be derived from having a quiet yarn
with the enemy when he looks in are the
Chinese. There are also two other nations
that pinned their faith to treaties—Belgium
and Servia. In each case they are now pin-
ning it to force. * #
Between the force that is used by a burg-
lar in bursting open a safe and the force em-
ployed to drag the ruffian off the premises
and flinging him into gaol, there is all the
difference between a tiger and a wallaby.
People who are asked to defend their coun-
try, their lives and their liberties against an
aggressor, and who reply that if the country
thus attacked employs force it will, like the
Macedonians and the Assyrians and the Car-
thaginians, be rushing down a steep place
into the sea and surrendering freedom and
doing all the rest of it, are either light in the
head or wilfully closing their eyes to what is
going on around them. If there is any other
method of repelling the German assault upon
the integrity of neighboring nations and of
resisting her bid for world domination than
by opposing force to force, these anti-force
people ought to come along with something
more reliable than lumps of philosophic
dough. The suggestion that Germany ought
to be let have her way and trample over both
hemispheres, in order that it may be proved
in about a couple of million years what a
huge ethical mistake she made, may be good
enough for Peace Society faddists, but it
looks about the most demented idea ever con-
ceived by man since the wretched Peruvians
asked a Spanish filibuster to run away and
play with half a ton of gold. But even if
the fantastic theory were put into effect the
first thing to be upended would be the doc-
trine about nations which- pinned their faith
to force going under, for in this case there
would be the absolute triumph of force over
non-resistance. Then the amended pacificist
verdict would be that, as it was no good
pinning faith to either a bayonet or a white
feather, the best thing to do was to renounce
the world and give the whole blessed pro-
blem up.
THE SWANKS OF GOSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Come mourn with me for the land of Gosh,
Oh, weep with me for the luckless Glugs
Of the land of Gosh, where the sad seas
wash
The patient shores, and the great King
Splosh
His sodden sorrow hugs ;
Where the fair Queen Tush weeps all the
day,
And the Swank, the Swank, the naughty
Swank, —r.
The haughty Swank holds sway—
The most mendacious, ostentatious.
Spacious Swank holds sway.
’Tis sorrow-swathed, as I know full well,
And garbed in gloom and the weeds o.
woe,
And vague, so far, is the tale I tell;
But bear with me for the briefest spell,
And surely shall ye know
Of the land of Gosh, and Tush and Splosh
And the Swank, the Swank, the foolish
Swank,
The mulish Swank bf Gosh —
The meretricious, avaricious,
Vicious Swank of Gosh.
Oh, the tall trees bend and the preen trees
send
A chuckle round the earth,
And the soft winds croon a jeering tune,
And the harsh winds shriek with mirth,
And the wee, small birds chirp ribald words
When the Swank walks down the street;
But every Glug takes off his hat,
And whispers humbly, “Look at that!
Hats off! Hats off to the Glug of rank!
The Swank! The Sivank! The Lord High
Swank!' 1
Then the East wind roars a loud guffaw,
And the haughty Swank says “Haw!"
His brain is dull and his mind is dense,
And his lack of saving wit complete;
But most amazingly immense
Is his inane self-confidence
And his innate conceit;
But every Glug and the great King Splosii
Bowed to the Swank, the fuddled Swank,
The muddled Swank of Gosh —
The engineering, peeping, peering,
Sneering Swank of Gosh.
In Gosh, sad Gosh, where the Lord Swank
lives,
He holds high rank and he has much pelf,
And all the well-paid posts he gives
Unto his fawning relatives
As foolish as himself.
In offices and courts and boards
Are Swanks, and Swanks, ten dozen
Swanks,
And cousin Swanks in hor4.es,
Inept and musty, dry and dusty,
Rusty Swanks in hordes.
Oh, the clouds so soft that sail aloft
Weep laughing tears of rain,
And the blue sky spread high overhead
Peeps through the mild disdain.
All nature laughs and jeers and chaffs
When the Sivank goes out to walkj
But every Glug bows low his head,
And says in tones surcharged with dread,
“Bow low, bow low, Glugs lean, Glugs
fat!”
But the North wind snatches off his hat,
And flings it high, while the Sivank .says
“Rot!
Most beastlay weathah! What?"
They lurk in every Gov’ment lair
’Mid dusty docket and frowsy file,
Solemnly squat in an easy chair, _
Penning a minute of rare hot-air,
In a departmental style.
In every office, on every floor,
Are Swanks, and Swanks, distracting
Swanks,
And Acting-Swanks a score,
And coldly-distant Sub-Assistant
Under-Swanks galore.
In peaceful days when the countryside
Poured wealth to Gosh, and the skies were
blue, .
The great King Splosh no fault espied
And be seemed entirely satisfied
With the Swanks who muddled through.
But when they fell on seasons bad,
Oh, then the Swanks, the bustled Swanks,
The hustled Swanks went mad; _
The minute-writing, nation-blighting,
Skiting Swanks went mad.
Oh, the tall trees sway like boys at play,
And they mock him, when he grieves,
As one by one, in laughing fun,
They pelt him with their leaves,
And the gay green trees joke to the breeze
As the Swank struts proudly by;
But every Glug with reverence
Pays homage to his ftride immense,
Pays homage deep to his lofty rank —
The Swank! The Swank! The pompous
Swank! ,
But the wind-borne leaves await their chance
And round him gaily dance.
Now, trouble came to the land of Gosh;
The sound of battle and anxious days;
And he summoned the Swanks, the great
King Splosh,
And he said their system would not wash
And ordered other ways. , , . ..
Then the Lord High Swank stretched forth
a paw,
And penned a minute re a Law,
And the Swanks, the Swanks, the other
Swanks,
The brother Swanks said Haw!
These keen, resourceful, unremorseful,
Forceful Swanks said “Haw!”
Then Splosh, the King, in a royal rage,
He smote his throne as he thundered
“Bosh!
In the whole wide land is there not one sage


With a cool, clear brain who will straight
engage
To sweep the Swanks from Gosh?”
But the Lord High Swank, from where he
stood,
Cried “ Barley! Guard your livelihood!
And, quick as light, the teeming Swanks,
The scheming Swanks, touched wood.
Sages plainly labor vainly
When the Swanks touch wood.
Oh, the stealthy cats that grace the mats
Before the doors of Gosh
Smile wide with scorn each sunny morn;
And, as they take their wash,
A sly grimace o’erspreads each face
As the Swank struts forth to Court.
But every Glug casts down his eyes,
And mutters, “Ain't 'is 'at a size!
For such a sight, our gods ice thank!
The Swank! The Swank! The noble
Swank!”
But the West wind tweaks his nose in sport;
And the Stvank struts into Court.
Then roared the King with a rage intense,
“Oh, who can cope with their magic
tricks!”
But the Lord High Swank skipped nimbly
hence,
And he hid him safe behind the fence
Of Regulation VI.
And under Section Four Eight O
The. Swanks, the Swanks, dim forms of
Swanks,
The swarms of Swanks lay low ;
The most tenacious, perspicacious,
Spacious Swank lay low.
Cried the King of Gosh, “They’ll not escape!
Am I set at nought by a crazed buffoon?”
But in fifty fathoms of thin, red tape
The Lord Swank swaddled his portly shape
Like a large, insane cocoon.
Then ’round and ’round and ’round and
’round
The Swanks, the Swanks, the whirling
Swanks,
The twirling Swanks they wound,
The swathed and swaddled, molly-coddled
Swanks inanely wound.
Each insect thing that comes in Spring,
To gladden this sad earth,
It flits and whirls and pipes and skirls
It chirps in mocking mirth,
A merry song the whole day long
To see the Swank abroad.
But every Glug, whoe'er he be,
Salutes, with grave humility
And deference to noble rank,
The Swank, the Swank, the sivollen
Swank !
But the South wind blows his clothes awry
And flings dust in his eye.
■ There’s trouble still in the land of Gosh ;
But the futile Glugs stand ’round and
gape,
While the Lord High Swank still rules King
Splosh,
With Laws of Blither and Rules of Bosh,
From out his lair of tape.
But in cocoons that mock the Glug
The Swanks, the Swanks, the Under-
Swanks,
The Dunder-Swanks lie snug;
Those most politic, parasitic,
Critic Swanks lie snug.
Then mourn with me for a luckless land,
Oh, weep with me for the Slaves of Tape,
Where the Lord High Swank still holds com-
mand,
And writes new rules in a fair round hand,
And the Glugs see no escape.
Where tape entwines all Gluggish things,
And the Swank, the Swank, the grievous
Swank,
The devious Swank still clings ;
The nervicacious, contumacious
Swank holds all the strings.
Oh, the blooms that grow and in a row
Peep o'er each garden fence,
They nod and smile to note his style
Of ponderous pretence;
Each roving bee has fits of glee
When the Swank goes by that way.
But every Glug he makes his bow,
And says, “Just watch him! Watch him
now !
He must have thousands in the bank!
The Swank! The Stvank! The Holy
Swank!”
But the wild wind flicks his kerchief knot,
And the Swank says, “Gusty! — What?”
VICTORIA.
C. J. DENNIS.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Hoof of Party.
Party Government was publicly decorated
with another thistle last week when N.S.W.
Premier Holman introduced his Bill for
closing pubs at 10 instead of 11 o’clock.
After the slick young man had talked some
particularly glaring nonsense about the
Federal Ministry being responsible for the
measure—as a matter of fact, the N.S.W.
Assembly two months ago directed the Mini-
stry to bring forward a Bill to shut off the
beer-tap at nine o’clock —he delivered himself
thus:—
Members who vote for any other hour than is
mentioned in the Bill must realise that they are
voting for no change at all. If members choose to
make it impossible for the Government to go on with
the measure I tell them the Government will not
proceed. s
This is a complete commentary upon the Par-
liamentary system under which the represent-
atives ot the people sit throttled before the
party joss. _ It also epitomises every essential
argument _in favor of Elective Ministries.
Working in such circumstances, the Legisla-
ture is an offence to the nostrils. A group of
individuals, honest or otherwise, who may
happen to seize control of the machine and
capture the key of the cashbox, can simply
use Parliament as the instrument for regis-
tering their will. So the public gets not
what Parliament wants or the electors want,,
but what for a variety of reasons a coterie of
wirepullers want. This paper is not much
concerned about the hour for the shutting Of
pubs. In its judgment the best results could
be achieved by altogether sweeping away a
lot of the frowsy hovels in which booze is dis-
pensed, and by enforcing the existing law
with respect to the others. To shut up a
decently-conducted hotel because a den over
the road offends against the terms of its
license is foolishness. But there is much in
the question that is highly debatable; and
when it comes to Parliament handling it
with a gag in its mouth and a padlock on its
wrists, the system which thus it priso-
ner is an outrage upon democratic govern-
ment.

To Deceive the Public Enemy.
“The stuff [name censored in the interests of
peace and harmony] has never been owned or
made in Germahy. Certain labels which pur-
ported to indicate that this was not the case
were employed as a means of competition
with German articles, but do not alter the
facts as stated above.” This is the gist of an
advertisement which recently appeared in
Australian papers, and it is not exactly the
sort to thrill us with admiration and pride.
Put baldly, it simply means that, while Ger-
man importations were popular, a firm of Aus-
tralian manufacturers sent out their goods
with a label which >. ; intended to falsely
indicate that they were foreign made, and
that now, when public feeling has blown
round like a weathercock, the proprietors
openly advertise the fact that the label v as a
swindle, and try to shuffle off the discredit of
it on the ground that it was meant to deceive
the enemy—the enemy in this case being the
Australian buyer. The whole affair looks
shabby and mean to the last degree; but as
an illustration of the ways of certain traders
it points a moral. It indicates the depth,
force and sincerity of some of that furious
German-hunting patriotism that is now so
much in evidence. Goods marked “Austra-
lian made” are now profitable, and the imme-
diate profit is the thing to be chased by
crooked ways or straight. Yet the fact that
a firm was willing to put Australian goods on
the market under pretence that they were
cheap foreign products whra it paid them to
do so is quite good enough proof that they
would attempt the same kind of thing again
the moment the wind veered round a point or
two. Where firms are converted suddenly to
a faith in things Australian at the precise
moment when their conversion means in-
creased sales for their goods, their patriotism
must be regarded with deep suspicion; and a
little of that suspicion may even be allowed
to flop over and rest upon the goods them-
selves. The advertisement referred to raises
the question as to how many other alleged
“foreign” manufactures may be the work of
Australian hands. Even when “Made in Ger-
many” does not pay, a Scotch, English or
American label may still do so. Take one
case only. A certain quantity of whisky is
milled, tempered and fitted to bottles within
the Commonwealth ; but has anybody observed
an Australian whisky in any of his favorite
pubs? If the stuff goes on the market as
Australian, its vendors keep very quiet about
it. The notion that imported articles are
better than those made in Australia has still
a firm grip on a large part of the public
mind, and the pushers of wares know it. That
is the reason why a tariff high enough for
our needs is our only safety. It not only pro-
tects the Australian worker, but saves the
unpatriotic public from its craze for sea-
borne shoddy.

Labor Gives Arbitration Another Punch.
Sydney coal lumpers, having come to the
conclusion that they might squeeze out a
few more bob, last week threw their
Arbitration award into the dustbin and
went out on strike. The essence of their
trouble was that there are too many coal
lumpers for the coal to be lumped; that,
therefore, employment is so precarious that
the cost of living has got beyond reach of
the man who is in this business. All of which
could be boiled down to this: the wages
offered to coal lumpers have made the in-
dustry so attractive that it has become over-
crowded. Whether the further raising of
wages is likely to make matters any better
is at least open to reasonable doubt. What
is not open to any sort of doubt is that this
calculated breach of award smites the already
crumbling Arbitration system another hard
blow. That doesn’t matter much so far as
the coalies and other big and powerful unions
are concerned. But it is the cruellest thing
possible so far as the small and weak bodies
of workers are concerned. The more miser-
ably they are paid, and the more they are in
need of help, the less their hope of winning
by a strike. They can expect help only
through arbitration or some other appeal to
reason and justice. In smashing arbitration
the big, powerful unions therefore do a
brutally selfish thing; and the sooner they
are brought to realise it the better. Until
they do realise it, their talk about “the
brotherhood of man” and “the solidarity of
the workers” is merely the flam of the hypo-
crite.
The Nelson Touch.
Trafalgar Day has been once more cele-
brated mildly in London. George Reid
rolled along to ,the Nelson Monument and
laid a wreath there in the name of Aus-
tralia, and various people made patriotic
speeches about the events of 110 years ago.
Trafalgar has now only the academic inter-
est of such events as the battle of Salamis,
the taking of Quebec and the landing of Cap-
tain Cook ; but its practical effect is still
seen in the unshaken faith of Britain in
navalism, and it had a heap to do with the
safety of the seas which enabled early
settlers to come to Australia. It had.
on the other hand, some pretty bad
effects which it is considered good
patriotism to ignore. Combined with
Waterloo, the smashing of the French and
Spanish fleets off Cadiz went far to create
that confidence in the British fighting man
under any strain and against any odds which
made the Radical opposition to votes for
military and naval expenditure possible. The
voter in England really thought that Tommy
Atkins was about good enough to wallop
half a dozen of any possible enemy, and that
John Tar afloat in a tub could smash any
other person of the sea encased in a steel
fortress. Fortunately, in spite of this view,
the navy was always pretty efficient, and in
latter years almost as strong as national
insurance demanded that it should be. But
this leaning to the navy to the neglect of the
army had its weak spots, which could be
traced to. the influence of the Trafalgar vic-
tor. Britain became more and more insular
in her thought and more and more fixed in
her belief that a single arm of defence was
sufficient. Her eyes were closed to the fact
that war must take on new shapes, and that
ships might not be the very last word in
defence. Yet had the lesson of Nelson’s
victories been properly learned it would have
gone a long way towards the bursting of the
Kaiser’s plans in the early part of the pre-
sent struggle. Nelson worked with a fleet,
it is true, but his success lay in the complete
novelty of his methods. He did not triumph
because he had a fleet which was bigger than
others, but because he worked that fleet in
a new way, which others could not learn,
and which had till then been thought im-
possible. Had Nelson’s method been properly
appreciated it should have led to a fixed
belief neither in ships nor in the quality of
British fighters, but in the supreme advan-
tage of having a new trick up the national
sleeve. That lesson is still open for Aus-
tralia to learn. The Greek phalanx, the
Roman shield roof, the British “thin red
line” were all new tricks in their time; and,
if inventive power among us is not exhausted
in filling up Federal income-tax returns, it
should be possible to find an Australian mode
of handing round wallops equivalent to that
“Nelson touch” which enabled the victors
to count the Trafalgar prizes before the first
shot was fired.

Drawing the Fangs of the Booze Trade.
Not content with renewing their unholy
alliance with Isaac Moses by passing a
resolution condemning the tote, Melbourne
Anglicans at their recent synod turned down
a scheme, fathered by L. Y. Bic. s, chief of
staff of Melbourne Age, for the “disinterested
management” of hotels. Biggs urged upon
the Church that it should adopt a construc-
tive temperance policy of its own, instead
of embracing the prohibition fantod, which
doesn’t prohibit, or the local option chimera,
which closes pubs only in districts where
they are already as scarce as rivers at Yass-
berra, while leaving them open in areas
which have four groggeries at each street
crossing with a few more scattered in be-
tween. He asked the Synod to affirm that
at the next local option poll the voters
should have an opportunity of voting for
“disinterested management” as an alternative
to the three existing options of continuance,
reduction and no license. Originating in
Sweden, the idea in its latest form comes
from England, where two limited companies
—the Home Counties Public House Trust
and the People’s Refreshment House Asso-
ciation —own several hundred pubs run on
“disinterested management” lines. Each
house has a salaried manager, who makes
no profit on the sale of booze, but gets a
liberal commission on all non-alcoholic
refreshment supplied. In a “coffee room”
tea, coffee, cocoa and soft stuff are served,
and cheap, well-cooked meals are obtainable.
The bar trade is only an incidental. No
person may hold more than 200 shares in
either company, and dividends are restricted
by the memorandum of association to a
maximum of 5 per cent., in order that the
shareholders may be free from the taunt of
making a good income out of thq stuff that
biteth like an adder. Surplus profits go to
the improvement of the properties and the
provision of better accommodation for cus-
tomers, with the result that many of the
pubs have well-kept tea- and beer-gardens
and comfortably-furnished lounges and
smoke rooms, with good pictures hanging on
the walls instead of whisky ads. The move-
ment in England has to fight the combined
hostility of the teetotal cranks and the
brewers, who unite to oppose the granting
of any new license to either company; but
it is going ahead, for all that —or was before
the outbreak of war. Its latest triumph is
its endorsement by the London County
Council, which, although pledged generally to
refuse licenses for pubs in resumed areas,
made an exception recently in favor of a
“disinterested management” house run by one
of the companies above mentioned. Earl
Grey, a former Gov.-Gen. of Canada, started
the movement in England, and during his
stay in Melbourne last year he gave a
friendly pat on the back to Biggs’s scheme.
The “Evangelicals”—the wowserish section
of the Anglican Church —were responsible
for the rejection of the idea by Melbourne
Synod a few weeks ago; but Biggs, who has
succeeded in shaking up somnolent Anglicans
to take an interest in such matters as hous-
ing reform and unemployment insurance, is
not discouraged. In the two years that he
has been at work on it he has' secured influ-
ential support, and the denominational paper
—the Church Standard —boosts him
strongly. He has now organised a team of
speakers to give addresses at Anglican
gatherings all over Victoria, by way of edu-
cating public opinion in his church; and he
has persuaded a syndicate of moneyed
Anglicans to put up the cash for running
an experimental “disinterested” pub to test
the suitability of the idea to Australian con-
ditions. The Bulletin gives him and his
scheme its blessing. The nationalisation of the
trade and the distribution of its profits in
adding to the public’s comforts is the ideal;
but it is only the ideal because it does what
this scheme also seems likely to do. That
is to say, it rids the pub of a landlord who
goes into the trade to make quick profits,
and whose business it is to induce his cus-
tomers to pour vast quantities of stuff down
their necks—the cheaper the stuff the better.
♦ :
The position is almost incredible. Here we
are trying to borrow money for this piffling
thing and that; wrangling over whether the
pub shall be open for 15 or 16 hours a
day; messing with bogus labor disputes and
seeing our transports hung up while coal-
heavers take a holiday; sticking up posters
inviting men to get a gun ; and indulging in
various circus tricks to inTfeigle recruits.
Would Australia be doing any'of these things
if a hostile army was detected digging itself
in at Fremantle? And if it would not, in
what respect does to-day’s situation differ
from what the nation would then be con-
fronted with? Nearly all this talk about
organising for war and for peace has been
time-wasting trash. We have at any
rate not started to do even the preliminary
work of organising for peace. If proof of
that is needed, just contemplate the Federal
Parliament’s performances in relation to the
tariff.
“0.K.”: To me the most astounding of the
revelations of the Great War is the evidence
not of Germany’s careful preparations in
armaments and arrangements for maintain-
ing supplies, but of her long, cold-blooded
preparations in treachery. The Hun has
been the modern Guy Fawkes of the world,
for ever hatching Gunpowder Plots in for-
eign countries. Belgium, France, Russia,
Britain, India and S’Africa have already
felt the effects of his unsuspected scheming
in pre-war times. His path of invasion at
the outset of the war was smoothed by
treachery. His first naval points were
scored by foul play. His attacks on mer-
chant shipning, from the time of the well-
informed Emden to the submarine warfare
against passenger steamers, have owed their
“triumphs” to German intrigue ashore. The
German Menace, as we now see it, is not
plain militarism, but militarism trimmed
with treason and insidious intrigue. Wil-
liam le Queux stresses the fact that the
German Government spent £7,000,000 on
secret spy service during the 10 years pre-
vious to. the war, the agents mostly being
“naturalised” in the countries where they
did their dirty work. The Kaiser carried
h;s master spy with him in his Royal suite
he visited Britain as the guest
of King and people. The ' agents of the
system and their agents, accomplices and
sympathisers are quartered everywhere.
What we have chiefly to consider is their
influence here. We have hundreds of dan-
gerous Germans among us, traitors who have
been “naturalised,” who hold good positions
and have been in close touch with their
Fatherland whilst the “world conquest”
schemes were in the making. Only a few
of them are interned. The others are still
imposing on our credulity and administer-
ing homecepatliic doses of poison to our
national sentiment. Why do we continue to
deal blindly with probable spies, when a
properly appointed Commission of Inquiry
would have no difficulty in proving or dis-
proving the hona fides of all the “natu-
ralised” Huns in our midst?
“Alamon” discloses something that calls for
prompt attention:—
So far, the N.T. has been remarkably free from
the pests that infest other parts of Australia, and
although it has a few of its own, such as white ants
and malarial mosquitoes, it has no rabbits, no frosts
severe enough to kill vegetation, and no droughts.
But quite a number of the inhabitants are ready to
spread two healthy Australian curses—water hya-
cinth and prickly-pear. The hyacinth is fostered in
the Experimental Gardens, Darwin, and grows on
some of the billabongs, though it is not dense enough
to check any water traffic yet. A flourishing prickly-
pear hedge is growing round a Chinaman’s garden
at West Arm, and almost every garden has one or
two pots of pear. Quite recently I bought some pro-
perty, and found five distinct varieties of the vege-
table porcupine carefully treasured in the soil.
I uprooted and burnt the lot, and have been re-
garded as a Prussian ever since.
Comfort from “The Old Soldier” :
General Joffre has told an interviewer what he
thinks about the chance of peace and the probable
duration of the war. He says practically the same
as two French generals— Chanzy, who commanded
the Army of the Loire, and Ducrot, who had a
command in the defence of Paris—said of Jules
Ferry’s patched-up peace with Germany in 1871.
Both maintained that it would have been better
had they fought the war out to the bitter end. If
the Government had not been in such a desperate
hurry to make peace it would have taken a hint
from the fact that more than once in the last three
months of fighting the German armies were very
hard pressed indeed, and it would have stood aside
while the soldiers did the job only they understood.
In any case, as Chanzy wrote in his book on the
Second Army of the Loire, it was better the nation
should suffer the invader a little longer that it
might have the chance of driving him out instead
of paying him out. Germany was not nearly so
ready for war in 1870 as last August 12 months.
For one thing, the welding of the Empire had not
been begun, and the armies of the different States
worked together very badly. Great technical im-
provements have also been made in armaments.
Yet, as General Joffre tells us: “When the
day comes, the German army must retreat,
and the discipline of fear will be put to
the final test. The result may be a rout. The dis-
cipline of fear robs the German soldier of initia-
tive, and makes him entirely subject to the will of
his officer.” On that we can build great hopes.
The German army of the present day is really an
enlarged copy of the old Prussian army of
Frederic William 11., gigantic grenadiers and
all. Their discipline was maintained by the
corporal’s cane. The cane is abolished now,
in theory, but the Germans must still attack
in close formation, under the eyes and
revolvers of their officers. No captain of theirs
would dream of leading his company into action.
His job is to inculcate what Joffre calls “the
discipline of fear.”
Ashmead Bartlett, describing the opera-
tions at the Dardanelles, played down to the
gallery the other day:—
We have a peculiar national habit of conceiving
great schemes, rushing in without a moment’s
notice, not counting the cost, and relying on the
bravery and ability of bur officers and men to take
the place of the years of study that foreign general
staffs devote to such works before they initiate their
prosecution. It is amateurish, but whereas the Ger-
man strikes with the blunt edere of a wedge and with
no weight behind it, we strike with the fine edge,
piling up the weight. The Dardanelles afford a good
instance of this curiosity of ours.
This suggests that Emperor Muddle should
be left the permanent monarch of all he
surveys—that John Bull’s normal habit is
that of the demented individual with a couple
of beers who, seeing a. street fight in pro-
gress, immediately leaps in and generally
gets hit on the head by 15 John Hops. But
really the whole story is a parody on the-
truth—an infernally dangerous sort of
parody, though, since it suggests that John
Bull gets along better than anyone else
because he is a superior person who cam
afford to treat calculations with contempt.
If Bartlett can produce evidence to show
that J. Bull’s navy is the kind of thing
that springs up at a moment’s notice and is.
not the result of many years’ study and much,
forethought, he ought to break the news as.
quickly as possible. If the evidence is not
available, then he ought to leave off giving:
Muddle any sort of encouragement.

General Snow Arrives at the Front,
The most exasperating feature of the Dar-
danelles affair is not that the Allied troops
engaged there have been trying to do the
impossible or even that the job was fumbled
at the commencement; it is that during
nearly the whole campaign the public was
deliberately bamboozled with stories of pro-
gress and encouraged to believe in pending
victory. It is the shock caused by this
sudden fall from air to earth that has caused
so much disappointment, mistrust and even
alarm. Yet though the mistakes made at
Gallipoli have had embarrassing conse-
quences in the Balkans, more comfort can
still be derived from the muddle there-
abouts than the German can extract from
some of his failures. If the Allies have not
yet reached Constantinople the Hun’s
address in France is not where he reckoned
on it being. Nor has the result of pushing
the Bear out of Poland and bustling him
off the Carpathians justified Berlin in
trimming itself with flags. Both East and
West, let us remember for our comfort, the
German has bitten off something far more
indigestible than the Allies found in their
mouth when they bit the Turk. And as
General. Snow has arrived to take command
in the North and the Russian has been hit-
ting back to some effect lately, old Von
Hindenberg, sitting on the edge of a bleak
wilderness, is. discovering that all his vic-
tories have led him on to a mighty unplea-
sant place, compared with which Gallipoli
is an Eden of comfort and delight. Mean-
while the Servian is fighting hard for life,
hospital trains are rolling back into Ger-
many from Flanders, the Italian is keeping
the Austrian busy, and British submarines
in the Baltic are making life quite interest-
ing to German shipping. What is being
done or is going to be done or is likely to
happen in the Balkan cockpit this paper
doesn’t know. On the contrary, it has come
to the conclusion that all news purporting
to ensue from that part, all statements
relating to persons, places, happenings and
things thereabouts, and every reference to
individuals, occurrences, possibilities, con-
tingencies, negotiations, rumors and con-
spiracies should on sight be regarded as
calculated perjury.

Dear Bulletin, —Recently I sent you a line
regarding wounded Tommy Kangaroos yearn-
ing (if you will let me say so) for Bulle-
tins, and I suggested that anyone at home
who passed on his copy, addressed “Wounded
Australians,” c/o Australian War Contingent
Ass., London, would be doing a good deed.
May I amend the address? Send to
“Wounded Australians,” British Austral-
asian Office, 115 High Holborn, London, for
then they will be given personally to the
men in hospital who want them, and given at
once. Australians who visit the hospitals
raid that office for papers every week, hav-
ing discovered that there is too much red
tape about associations and London formal
committees. When men are out of hospital
they can buy their literature; but in hospi-
tal they are allowed no money, and wounded
or sick and tired they hunger for something
from home. I will see that the boys get
the papers at once. There are at least 10,000
of our wounded in England now, and many
of them have had no letters or papers for
months. Please help me to do this little
thing for them.—Yours sincerely, Alice
Grant Rosman.
Archibald took his deposition from the
Federal Ministry with the dignified calm of
the statesman. He merely gave the Adel-
aide papers a long interview about “politi-
cal assassination,” “the conceited place-
hunter on the make,” and a “pestilent gang
of greedy place-hunters,” and left it at that
—for the present.
A cheap trip to Rabaul, where Australia
had its first bit of a fight, has been arranged.
You may go there, in fact, for sixpence.
Burns Philp have given the Allies Day com-
mittee in Sydney a ticket for the round trip

the world to get it for sixpence. The Allies

ture shows and theatres or at the office, 92b

directions for winning this prize.
Fowell Buxton, dead in London at 78, was
a survival of the mid-Victorian evangelical
type, and Ms Governorship in South Aus. 20
years ago was only a short break in a career
of philanthropy and “movements.” It was
anti-slavery work that brought the old Essex
family a baronetcy in 1840, and the late
holder of the title enjoyed it for nearly 60
years. His mother was one of the banking
Gurneys; he drew much wealth from that
source and from a brewery, married an earl’s
daughter, and had an old-fashioned family of
10. These have mostly carried on a family
tradition by intermarrying with Anglican
clergymen or their daughters; Bertram
Hawker, of S.A., is a son-in-law. The late
baronet was an occasional member of _ the
House of Commons, but lost more elections
than he won. His second and third sons,
Noel and C. R. Buxton, are much better
known as politicians and authorities on social
questions and the Turkish problem.
There was a discussion on the Tariff in
the Maoriland Parliament the other day,
and while Ward was mentioning the various
lines that he proposed to tax, a member in-
terjected “Why not put a tax on motor-tyres?”
(These are free in M.L.) Ward cheerfully
answered that this would do no good, as a
duty would give one particular co. a mono-
poly. Asked how he made that out, Ward
replied: “They would erect mills and manu-
facture here, and we would get no revenue.”
The blackguards are quite 1 capable of
doing it. When you come: to think of
it, how absurd it is to produce anything
at all in the country! For a start,
why not prohibit the growing of butter and
meat? Ward could put a tax of 3d. a lb. on
these things, and rake in tens of thousands
of pounds. True, if nobody produced any-
thing there wouldn’t be anybody to pay any
revenue, and if there were anybody they
wouldn’t have anything to pay any revenue
with; but a little flaw like that mustn t be
allowed to trouble Ward.

“Are We Downhearted?” Howard Ver-
non, Vinia de Loitte and their company
asked a Sydney audience at the Little
Theatre on Saturday evening, and the audi-
ence unanimously voted “Aye!” The
alleged revue was presented with the bird
quite early in the evening, and the bird’s
name was Aggie. But it might just as well
have been named Howard Vernon or Les
Kelso, for neither of these comedians were
comic. Les Kelso, who impersonated an
alleged Hebrew, belongs to the “Bellerive”
class of humorists. Aggie was the keynote
of a long, dull scene on Manly beach, in
which an earnest feminine amateur so got
on the nerves of the audience that it counted
her out. Thereafter nothing that could be
done by Vinia de Loitte, who sang and acted
with determined vivacity, nor the youthful
chorus of happy youngsters, could open the
cage for the bird named Aggie. The truth is
that this Australian revue owes its failure
to “X,” the modest author, whose dialogue
is as dull and hackneyed as his ideas are
vulgar. One long, dreary item in the revue
is evidently inserted to state the noble truth
that Manly cottages are inhabited by bugs;
another scene introduces a cartoon showing
the Premier shaking hands with a Hun; and
a third is a dreary and humorless item in a
newspaper office. Though Aggie was not
wholly undeserving, the rightful owner of
the fowl is “X.”
* * * *
The few bright feathers are supplied by
Vinia de Loitte’s voice and animation ; by
Howard Vernon’s ludicrous hornpipe; by
little Thelma Burness’s song; by that fine
song, “So-Long,” written by J. Barr and so
stirringly set to music by May Summerbelle,
sung by Vinia de Loitte; and by Evie May’s
singing, the unconquerable gaiety of the
child-singers and dancers, and the two
charming scenes painted by the Clints. There
is no attempt at a plot, even a revue plot,
and the topical references are usually in
bad taste and as ancient as the fish-shop
puns. A pity ! There is room for an Aus-
tralian revue in this city. But not for Aggie
or “X.”
“ARE WE DOWNHEARTED?”
After a long absence “the Bird” appears at
the Little Theatre.
“The Man Who Stayed at Home
(specially revived for the purpose) is now
finishing a fill-in week at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney. In the present version of the cheery
spy-drama, Charlotte Ives—a graceful and
appealing young person—takes the part of
» es r, r
crU( j e ly i n place of Cyril Mackay as the
traitorous Admiralty German, Carl Sander-
son. Otherwise the company is unchanged,
Frank Harvey, as. the Secret Service
boarder, giggles his way triumphantly
through three acts until the big drum is
heard shooting German submarines behind
the scenes, and the excited melo.-spy foolishly
exchanges his loaded automatic for an
unloaded trinket of an old-fashioned type,
But, though Harvey is good, the finest act-
ing of the show is Eily Malyon’s admirable
Fraulein Schroeder, the embittered old-maid
German governess who is quite willing to
make a signal pyre of the seaside boarding-
house and all its occupants. Perhaps a long
course of humiliation by the best English
families would make a humble educational
alien feel like that. “Kick-in” is due this
coming Saturday.

“ARE WE DOWNHEARTED?” AT
LITTLE THEATRE.
Howard Vernon borrows ten bob from
Isaac Kelso.
The performer who works too hard for his
laughs is a severe trial. Herbert Winter,
now at Sydney Tivoli, is a grafter all right;
he works with his hands and his face, and
half the time the audience can’t see his eyes
because he has screwed them up tight in a
perfect agony of effort. The humanitarian
who witnesses his turn feels impelled to rise
and shout “Don’t do it if it hurts you!”
Miss Annie Kent is another who makes
heroic efforts to please. Both of them really
ought to try a little more repose. Violinist
Mary Daw, Coy De Confidence Trickey (the
clever masquerader in brown paint), the
easy-going Harkins pair, Nolan the juggler
and the dancing Tyrells are still helping
Ella Caspers and Hector Goldspink to send
people away with that satisfied feeling.

The free illustrated advertisement of the
property recently printed in this column
soon discovered a suitable tenant for Pre-
mier Holman’s deserted Government House
in Sydney Domain, which has been unoccu-
pied ever since a past Governor-General was
evicted under painful circumstances. Pre-
mier Holman’s incoming tenant is Sir Gerald
Strickland, State Governor of N.S.W., and
in order to reassure nervous Labor electors
as to his eligibility, the papers have been
printing illustrations of the new tenant’s
former moated and turreted homes. Appar-
ently he is quite used to living in places like
this, and may therefore be relied on not to
singe the portrait of Governor Belmore “in
his private clothes,” or chop up the wooden
heraldic advertisements of former tenants
for kindling on washing-day.

Planquette’s opera, “The Old Guard,”
never had as many points of recommenda-
tion in its English version as the same com-
poser’s “Cloches de Corneville,” which, by
the way, is of all French opera-bouffe the
best adapted for production by a capable
amateur co. Two special features endeared
“The Old Guard” to Australia of yore—
firstly, the grotesque fooling of Elton, as
Polydore Poupart, almost as cleverly re-
peated by George Lauri; and, secondly, the
interpolated ballet in the second act that
Leon Caron wrote the music for. Poupart’s
song of “The Dashing Militaire” and the
lively dance appertaining thereto were the
climax of a notable personal success. For
the rest the performance was sweetly musi-
cal throughout, but the story for the most
part had its only interest in a weak plagiar-
ism of the plot of “Cloches de Corneville.”
The present revival at Melbourne Majesty’s,
with Phil Smith as the unworshipful Mayor
of Vaudrez Les Vignes, is rather damaging
to the opera’s old-established reputation.
This Poupart is not so much an absurdly
funny personage as a merely ridiculous per-
son. His Dashing Militaire dance has not
enough ginger in it. He doesn’t make the
best of his part, and the same remark applies
to Maggie Dickinson as the cantinifere and
Ethel Cadman as Patatout. Not that the
parts are matters to make much •

the ,11th. The co. at the Royal will be then
nearing the point of departure, and this
matinee festival will offer faithful mummer-
worshippers a last-but-one opportunity to
gaze on Muriel Starr.

Another spasm of “Bought and Paid For ’
at Melbourne Royal is again enabling Muriel
Starr to draw a distinction between a cham-
pagne endearment and a sober hug. Miss
Starr’s views on the matter, however, are
still delivered in the old gabble, which
doesn’t carry emphasis with all its hurry.
On the other hand, Mill ward has improved
his study of the boozy millionaire. The final
stages of his drunk are stronger and he
bashes in his wife’s door in a more convinc-
ing way. All told, Millward’s Stafford is
the nearest approach to a photograph in
all his gallery of ornate swells. A new
man, Hobart «T. Cavanaugh, is cast for
Jimmy Gilley. Coming after James Harri-
gan, who gave a broader reading of the
character’s robust vulgarity, Cavanaugh
sounds like a plagiarism; but he is too
youthful in appearance to pass for Miss
Davies’s husband. Dramatically Miss
Davies is as satisfactory as before; Blakis-
ton is only facially unreal as the Japanese
servant, Oku; and Miss Boswell’s long,
thrilling glances are briefly advertised in the
part of the French maid Josephine. Next
Saturday “Madame X” will be repeated.

What shall be said of the wholesome, un-
conventional play which came to Melbourne
Princess’s last Saturday? “A Scrape o’ th’
Pen” works around that unconventional
habit of the Scawtch to count as a legal
marriage a mutual promise of matrimony ex-
pressed by two people before two witnesses
wi’out the presence o’ a meenister. But the
plot, which is verra thin, matters very little.
The Graham Moffat show travels on its
Scawtch characterisations and its bits o’
genuine pathos and humor. For instance, the
wedding of a farmhand, Geordie Pow (our
old friend Abie Baker of “Bunty”), with
Beenie Scott happens on New Year’s Eye,
and this gives a reason for most effective
comedy. David Urquhurt, who was the
Deacon in “Bunty,” drives a ploo as Peter
Dalkeith. He is the rejected lover of Beenie
the bride. His fatal love affair makes his
fortune, for he is given a tentative job as
professional mourner at a local funeral. He
has only to think of Beenie and her coming
wedding and the real tears roll down his
cheeks, so his enormous success as a figure
of grief gets him a conteenuous job aaat
27 sliilluns a week. But the play, though
full of plums of drollery, is in its dramatic
■ form lengths behind “Bunty.”

Graham Moffat and his wife, as the
bickering auld folk of Honeyneuk, bubble
along with Scotch humor that warms the
hairts o’ the congregation. .Leezie, the auld
wife, has her quaint ideas on Bible history.
“If they deed rend their gairments in those
days wi’ sorrow they proobably rent them
up the seams so that their wumman folk
could aye sew them oop again.” Matta,
reading the lesson on New Year’s Eve, opens
at Chronicles vi, and gets tangled in the list
of “begats.” “It’s no approopriate for the
occaaasion,” says Leezie. “Wumman!”
thunders Matta, “for 50 yeeers I have begun
at the first Buik and gone the straight
road to Revelations, and turned back to
begin the Buik again, an’ I’ll no’ be turned
aside frae the straight road for any new-
fangled notjons.” The play is fringed with
shepherds, collie dogs and whusky. A
special collie in the play. Ross, has his name
billed like a human, he being a pedigreed
earl from Sydneyside.

THE ONLY WAY TO STOP FOOD
FERMENTATION.
NEUTRALISE ACIDITY BY TAKING A
LITTLE MAGNESIA.
It’s the gas generated by fermenting food
tha t distends your stomach and causes you
to have a flushed face after eating, with
headaches, heartburn, flatulence, etc., and
the reason why drugs, patent medicines and
artificial digestants do not give you relief is
that they have little or no effect upon the
acidity which physicians have proved to be
the root cause of practically all forms of
stomach trouble. An absolutely pure antacid
or neutralising agent must be employed to
neutralise this harmful acid, and. the pre-
paration ' Invariably used in hospitals and
prescribed by physicians and specialists is
bisurated magnesia. This you can obtain
from all high-class chemists in either powder
or tablet form, and in the majority of cases
half a teaspoonful of the powder or two tab-
lets taken with a little water after meals
will be found quite sufficient to instantly
neutralise excessive acidity of the stomach
and thus prevent all possibility of the-food
fermenting.*
That triumph, in the Balkans, may be
snatched from the jaws of British indecision
and Bulgarian infamy is the hope inspired
by that royal spirit, King George IV. top-

bv Allen Doone to cause a rush on the pay-
box and enable him to clasp his colleen
with a V.C. on his breast. The
hero, however, doesn’t borrow O Leary s
name for limelight purposes until he is
about played out as Richard Dale, an alleged
soldier who deserts his regiment to support
his sister in a domestic crisis. The damsel
having indulged in the luxury of a secret
husband—Darcy Neill, who goes to the
Front and is presumed to be slain —she obvi-
ously needs all her brother’s sympathy and
assistance in combating the world's views
anent the respectability of her sudden babv.
In a state of indignant explanation the
lady and her brother soon leave tlieir Irish
home for Paris, where the mislaid Neill is
found with decayed, boots and a departed
memory playing the John Stofel act with
Hibernian variations. Fortunately the
early return to form of his thinking appai a-
tus straightens things out considerably, and
a mild, military villain, who has been pro-
ducing general discomfiture with the usuai
canards and bags of money, is brought to an
angry, bloodstained end. Strictly speaking,
“O’Leary, V.C.,” is innocent of violence or
warlike features, even its corpses occurring
off-stage, apparently to leave two gaps in the
narrative for Doone’s falsetto to fill. Doone
in the leading role reveals himself as the
same old astute specialist in flattering the
feelings of his audiences. In no scene does
he amount to an actor, but he achieves a
success of showmanship. Miss Edna Keeley,
as Mona Fitzpatrick, brings the pretty,
petted manner of the spoilt kid again into
use: and Miss Ethel Bashford endows Lily
Dale (Mrs. Neill) with the small, crushed
spirit of a domestic drudge. As the alleged
bad man Captain McNeven, Onslow Edge-
worth is as tame and respectable as the
descendant of seven generations of church-
wardens; but Clive Farnham is happy
enough as Darcy Neill, and uses his voice
with effect. Tom Buckley, Frank Cullenane
and Miss Ethel Grist bare their brogues, as
it were, to the glory of ould Ireland ; and a
crude imitation of the Tin Can Band, headed
by Connie Kyte, intrudes as a noisy body:
guard to Misther Doone.
Last week’s remarks concerning the Tivoli
in Melbourne will serve for this week s.
notice. Duncan and Godfrey, Warwick’s Bur-
lesquers, Terry and Lambert and the Brus-
sels Concert Co. are the latest turns on
the premises, whilst the oldest items are
still bunched together as Follies, Portions
of the Follies bunch look very faded to the
local eye, but to the new audiences during
Cup week all things appear fresh.

Equestrianism is a topic of burning inter-
est to Melbourne just now, so the star turn
at the Circus raises the question whether
May Martin Wirth could ride a Cup gee to
victory whilst turning somersaults in the
saddle. Probably she couldn’t. The lions,
the seals, the Human Aeroplanes, Maximo
on the slack wire, and many other people
and things that came with Wirtlis’ Circus
are carrying on their business as usual.
Owing to the crowded state of the bill the
elephants, thus far, are merely standing
around in the menagerie, ruminating on the
emptiness of life.

Brown and Sorlie, the bright young coons
with the gentlemanly manners and pleasing
voices, are again toeing the footlights at
Melbourne Bijou. Jessie and Dolly Millar,
instrumentalists, and Val and Lottie - New-
man, described as the “revuesical pair,” are
also revivals, the only new acts being Mar-
ville’s Cockatoos and Abdy’s Dog Circus,
which are both moderately clever and enter-
taining. In another section of the same pro-
gramme Wykeham and Miss Preston are
shouting cheerfully in a sketch whereof the
main props are a bed and two suits of
pyjamas.

The Australian Pavilion at the Panama
Exposition was mentioned in Hoyt’s Mel-
bourne programmes on Saturday. The top-
line sensation, however, was a film version
of “The Pit,” wherein a good Yankee actor,
Wilton Lackaye, gets all the fat in the
principal part. Florence Reed, • another
cinema star, similarly enjoys the grease in
the next big subject, “The Dancing Girl.”
The long picture recounting the fall of Jack
Johnson with impressive detail is being
screened at certain advertised hours this
week.

Adelaide “pictures” are serving out strong
meat. West’s undertake to show the office
girl how ruthless employers regard her as
fair prey. The Pav. has been presenting
“Five Nights.” To have toned this story
down to pass the Censor is a triumph of skill
—and humor. The adapter might now try
his hand at presenting “Hamlet” without
any bloodshed. Wondergrapli gives May
Irwin and Mary Fuller type as big as the
plays they play in. The King’s has-a fine,
well-mixed variety bill: Tlieodorwicz, Piquo,
and Maud and Gill on the athletic side;
Goolmans and a “sundowner” on the
musical; Fredo, Marion, Anita Primrose and
May Erne in various acting or “entertain-
ing” turns. Wintry evenings have been all
against outdoor shows. But at Austral
Gardens Flockton Foster and Cecilia Gold
are among the funniest of the Ideals,” and
Geregory I van off’s magic fiddle is again in
the team this season. Branscombe’s Dan-
dies are strengthening up their musical side,
too, at the Exhibition, with concerted pieces
and a Male Quartet.

the moment, but promises Muriel Starr

AT POVERTY POINT.
Of a Day that was.all sunshine: —
After reading some Melbourne notices :of the death
of Syd Day his oldest friends must have rubbed
their eyes. A lot about Syd Day the printer, the
motorist, the old-fashioned bicycle-rider, and the
motor-tricycle exploiter, but not a word about Syd
Day the entertainer! I saw him for the first time
on the vaudeville stage when he was quite a young
man, with a repertoire of two or three Cockney
character songs, which he sang very well. The
last time he appeared in public was at Melbourne
Athenaeum Hall, for the benefit of his old pal, Fred
B. Norton. That' was fully 10 years ago. Day was
the ; only comic songster- on a highly-variegated
bill, and he sang his. old song of an impecunious
bloke wot found a trybit in the road and tossed it
up to see wevver he should buy a shave or a beer
wif ther money. ’Eads a shave, an’ tails a beer.
Well, it eome down a ’ead, so ’e thort e'd gif
tlrer beer a eharnst, and he chuckt the coin up again.
That time it rolled down a drain and was lorst.
Syd Day might have gone far as a vaudeville per-
former if he had not preferred to run his own show
as a printer. He was a humorist with a natural
sense of values in Cockney dialect expressions. His
personal friends will remember him also as a droll
raconteur. He didn’t have to exert himself to be
amusing. He didn’t fling the Cockneyisms into his
yarns, or his moralisings, with deliberate intention
to get a laugh. They dropped in casually as he
went along, and they were always the right bit of
slang in the right place.
“0.K.”: In the original production of
“The Old Guard” (11/4/1891) Florence
Young played the part now taken by Gladys
Monerieff, Flora Graupner was the little
cantiniere to whom Maggie Dickinson gives
less musical value, and Violet Varley, as
Palatout the Bugler, sang song which
now falls to Ethel Cadman. Vi V. sang it
sj well that Sarah* Bernhardt, just arrived
in Melbourne at the end of May, flung her
bouquet to the ill-fated little woman from
her private box. Those were about the
palmiest days of Melb. Princess’s. Elton
made his biggest bit as Polydore Poupart,
and Howard Vernon was the Marquis.
Ryley and Leumaue took the baritone and
tenor parts. Ida Osborne, a contralto who
was up to concert-platform standard, had
the place where Thelma Kaye is standing
to-day ; and May Pollard, Katie Potter, Tom
Grundy and others took minor characters
that are not now named in the advertise-
ment. Of the original eight “Fin de Siecle”
ballet girls Miss Minnie Everett is still asso-
ciated with the show. She figures as in-
structress of the new lot. In those days
Dr. Carver, the rifle-shooting “Wild Ameri-
can,” was appearing with Lily Dampier at
the Alexandra (now Her Majesty’s) under
Alfred Dampier’s ■ management. Fat
Fortesque was burlesquing in “Evangeline”
at the old Opera House, whilst Jimmie
McMahon was sorrowing over the frost-
bitten spec. All dead. George and Christine
Darrell, with Oily Deering (the latter two
long deceased), were doing melodrama. at
the Royal until Widow O’Brien Sheridan
took the floor. The late Robt. Brough was
acting at the Bijou. As for “The Old
Guard” co. fully half a dozen of them besides
Elton are numbered with the gone.
Eva Guildford-Quin, the Australian actress
who got her best chance in “The Morals of
Marcus,” made a London hit in “The Great
Adventure” a year ago. Arnold Bennett’s
fantastic play was staged at the King’s after
it had been running 500 nights at the Kings-
way, and Miss Guildford was leading lady in
the new co. But it soon went on tour. She
sprang into further notice by her “beauti-
ful acting” in a character part at a war
matinee show. Critics talked of her “beauty,
grace, musical voice and charming diction.”
She had all those qualifications before she
left Australia some years ago. No contem-
porary actress hereabouts could talk half
so sweetly, as The Bulletin remarked at
the time. Yet she had to go to England to
be “discovered” by the solemn dailies. Man-
ager Arthur Bourchier had been making over-
tures to the girl from Australia when she
was last heard of.
The latest Maoriland mummer to get a
start with Uncle Sam is E. Pirie Bush, of
Wellington (M.L.), who while in these parts
was with Niblo and went to Wilson’s Coun-
try with him. Bush has gone on tour in
“Peg o’ My Heart,” a Noo Yark success.
Enid Bennett from this continent and also
late of the Niblo co. is a member of the same
co.
The “German” performer may have been
a Cockney Dutchman or a Scandinavian, but
that doesn’t matter —he must change his
moniker as though he- were guilty as the
Kaiser. On the Fuller circuit just now is
“Mons Poincaire, the French Whistling
Mimic.” When he came to Australia with
a “wonder-show” two years ago he was
Fritz von Liston.
The champion mean man is sneaking
round Adelaide somewhere. The Repertory
Theatre gave Douglas Walsh a farewell even-
ing, and he came from camp to play in four
parts and face an enthusiastic send-off. After
the audience had gone the players, got to-
gether on the stage to present him with a
revolver as a slight token of their esteem.
Then the trouble began- Someone had stolen
the presentation pistol from the dressing-
room during the evening.
“ Jwosp”: After 62 years’ roaming, Wil-
liam H. L. Denny, the original Dog in the
-American production of “The Blue Bird,
- died the other day. He was a Gilbert and
Sullivan man and was the original Shad-
bolt in “The Yeoman of the Guard” in 1888.
Later he was Scaphio in “Utopia Ltd.” when
Charlie Kenningham got into his first
“original” cast. Denny was grabbed for
G. and S., by the way, because he made a
-hit as Noah Topping in Pinero’s “Dandy
Dick.” He was Bottom in “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream” in the Shakspearian co.
George Musgrove brought to Australia about
12 years ago.
The Corricks have carried out their threat
and settled down at Launceston, after years
of wandering. There’s a nice dry bit in the
bank; but they don’t intend to blew it in
fatted calves and other riot. So a Corrick
school for music has been set up to keep the
pot boiling, and a motor-car for the tuneful
family is about the only visible extrava-
gance.
“0.K.,” on a recent Yankee play
Somebody disguising himself (or herself) under
the norn-de-snort of “New York,” has risen to dis-
agree with the “Sundry Show” notice of “Playing
the Game,” one of the writer’s grounds for disagree-
ment being that “Agnes Keogh’s part doesn’t call
for ‘breadth of melodramatic style,’ ” as The Bul-
letin said it did. “New York” concludes his (or
her) contradiction by stating that “but for Ameri-
can munitions and steel exchanged for European gold
the war would be all over, and all over the wrong
way for civilisation.” Which, incidentally, is a
typically Yankee suggestion of the untruth that the
U.S.A. are manufacturing about half of all the
munitions used in the war, and wouldn’t dream of
supplying them to Germany even if that market
were not closed. The play’s the thing, however.
“New York” impudently states that Agnes Keogh’s
part wasn’t broadly melodramatic. Gee! She
played in the first act a giddy, dissatisfied wife who
eloped with a casual lover in a motor-car, after
pinning a note of information to her baby's frock.
In subsequent acts she was the woman of easy virtue,
turning up to blackmail the husband who thought
her dead, and meeting unexpectedly one of the vari-
ous men she had duped and deserted, gnd introduc-
ing herself to her own daughter as a friend
of the mother who is supposed to be dead.
Miss Keogh’s part, then, is that of a brazen-faced
adventuress, confronted by two of the men she has
“chucked,” and shamed into dissimulation by an art-
less, unsuspecting daughter. Yet “New York” can
see no need for breadth of melodramalically-emo-
tional style in the performance of this luridly-melo-
dramatic part. And he (or she) calls the play “sin-
cere” 1 So it is. Sincerely theatrical, and, there-
fore, a thing to be presented with much theatrical
color and effect.
“Ho”: Local theatregoers saw Hugh
McCrae for the first time the other evening
in Eden Pliillpotts’s one-act “Hiatus.” The
tall young man, who was cast as an art
connoisseur, did not have much of a chance,
as the playlet belongs to a couple of she-
mimes; but his entry made the audience sit
up and take notice. A personality as vital
as that of the Australian black-and-white
poet is rarely met behind the footlights; and
when he conquers his nervousness he should,
in the right sort of part, do something worth
while. Unfortunately if he joined the pro-
fessional ranks here he would almost cer-
tainly be boomed as a matinee idol, which
would decrease his chances of becoming an
actor.
(Continued on page 3D.)
The dropping of Archibald from the
Federal Cabinet led to heated inquiries in
the S. Aus. Assembly about a supposed in-
justice to that State. The Chief Sec. gave
the cold and obvious reply that there is
nothing in the Constitution to say that
honors shall be parcelled out among the
States. “Poor old Archibald!” said the
Liberals. But the Labor crowd had a retort
ready. “Poor old Freeman !” they chorused.
For Freeman, whose chucking-out from the
secretaryship of the Liberal Union in S.A.
was noted last week, does not take it at all
kindly, and calls Heaven and the daily papers
to witness that he has not deserved it, and
hints broadly at “disloyal members of the
staff.’’ He has even obtained a big batch
of testimonials from country centres of the
Liberal Union. But it is all of no avail.
The trade explanation of the matter :
Yankee Henry Ford, who threatened to withdraw
his business from any Amurkan banks that sub-
scribed to the Anglo-French war loan, is a cranky
pacifist, suffering from the humorous delusion that
the weight of the American loan to the Allies might
drag the country into war and upset his business.
But he has no say in the management of Ford
motor companies outside the United States. The
English concern advised its profit-sharing employees
-to buy British War Loan stock. Moreover, the
managing-director, by way of urging the invest-
ment, gave his personal undertaking to buy the
vouchers or bonds from any employee who might
want to sell out in a hurry. As for the Ford Motor
Co. of Canada, it is mainly a Canadian property;
and although the old man in New York; owns about
' 25 per cent, of the shares, the sympathy and re-
source of the co. are with the Allies right enough.
. Officers and employees have already subscribed more
than 40,000 dollars to British and Canadian Red
Cross and patriotic" funds, and 400 of the Ford men
have joined the Canadian Expeditionary force, with
their billets guaranteed to them. All that the l
’Murkan peace-at-any-price Ford has done is to
advertise the pro-Britishness of the offshoot com-
panies at the expense of his, own particular show
as far as foreign trade is concerned. By the way,
it has always been the Canadian,! Ford Co. that sup-
plied the cars to Australia., None, or practically
none, came from New York.
MUSIC!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It poured for half an hour, then steady, soaking
rain- set in, and to-night I’m going to sleep lulled
by the sweetest music the dwellers in a drought-
smitten continent can listen to —the music of the
rain on the roof.
—Exultant letter of an Outback friend.
Oh, I used to envy most the folk that live in Sydney
town
For the pleasures they have handy to dispel ill-
fortune’s frown.
In the sultry summer weather, though in offices they
stew,
They have cooling ocean breezes, and the joys of
surfing, too !
There are pubs, and friends to drink with, there
are lips that must be kissed;
But when I had left the city, it was not these
things I missed:
It was music that I wanted—concert, theatre or
band;
And I looked and couldn’t find it when I first went
on the land ;
But when I knew the Bushland, and from cities lived
aloof,
I heard the sweetest music—the rain upon the
roof!
When for months the Drought has lingered, and the
bright, unpitying sky
Is the same indiff’rent Demon as the deadly days
go by;
When there’s bitter dust for herbage, and the bones
of beasts laid low,
And I wonder how much longer in endurance I can
go;
When it’s ten miles to the water, which is quickly
giving out,
And it’s twenty to the next hole —oh, the Deity I
doubt!
But at last the rain-clouds gather, and our brightest
hopes are crowned,
When the healing streams are’laving all the parched
and wounded ground!
In that time of lean, pinched belly, and of sun-
cracked, ragged hoof,
There’s no music out of Heaven sweet as rain
upon- the roof.
It is bliss to lie and listen as the raindrops patter
down,
Their moist fingers playing music on my dwelling’s
iron crown!
Oh! the pleasant fancies thronging, as the welcome
carol swells—
For a tale of sure salvation is the story that it
tells.
It brings visions of a grey land clothed in splendid
robes of green,
And of glist’ning streams of water where cracked
clay-pans long have been.
Oh! it tells of seed-germs bursting, and of wheat
with eager blades
Cutting through the moistened softness of its earthy
barricades.
In the vision gay and splendid that before me is
unrolled, '
I am reaping endless acres, and the harvest is of
gold!
And the sweetness of that music there is nothing to
excel —-
Not the softest notes of Melba, Crossley, Castles or
Narelle.
There is balm and hope abundant woven in the web
and woof
Of the music, when the drought breaks, of the rain
upon the roof.

Alt unusual trial in Victoria last month
was that of Demetrius Morfessie, who killed
his wife in a lit of jealousy away back in
July, 1910. He was at the time adjudged
unfit to plead, but time and medicine have
done their work, and now the patient Law,
having fattened him up for a Christmas
killing, has sentenced him to death,
ANOTHER POSTER.
“Been There” : There really isn't any Bul-
garian nation. Nominally Slavic, the stock,
is Ugric, and relationship to the Lapps,
Fins and Samoyeds is still plainly stamped
upon the high cheek-bone, narrow, slanting
eye, and straight, light hair of the Bulgarian
proper. Even at that, he is only about half
the population; the “impropers”—about
1,500,000 —present an unholy hotch-potch of
Turk, Tartar, Circassian, Albanian, Rou-
manian, Armenian, Greek, Jew and Gipsy.
The language, akin to Russian, is miserably
mongrelised with Turkish, Persian, Italian
and Greek, and a literature hasn’t arrived
vet. The Turks, Tartars, Albanians and
Circassians are Mohammedans after a
fashion, and the rest of the ponulation, label-
ling itself “Greek Church,” is just plain
pagan ; brutal, ferocious, cunning and super-
stitious beyond belief.
“D.F.” : This hushing-up won’t do. An or-
c-hardist at Glenorchy (Tas.), who gave some
cases of fruit for the troops, put his card in
each case. Five cards have come back to him.
Four of them were sent by people who allege
that they are connected with the fruit trade,
and one by a Canadian soldier who got it
in some fruit which he bought, he says, at
a shop. Others who had given fruit have
had similar experiences. The official ex
planation is that some of the fruit was s<
decayed and rotten that it was not con-
sidered tit for the troops, and was sold to
defray expenses. This no doubt accounts
for the fact that some of the fruitshop people
already referred to comment on the fine
quality of the fruit, and say how much better
it was than they can usually buy! When
such cases crowd in I find myself wondering
whether crimes like this would have been
committed had Australia been represented
at the other end by somebody less addicted
to sleep than George lieid.

Nationalisation of the pub-keeping busi-
ness in the Northern Territory is proving a
great success already. All hands had their
wages raised and then they promptly went
out on strike to encourage the Government
to go on nationalising pubs. If the Govern-
ment takes the hint we will read of some-
thing like this :—-
Interviewed at Canberra this afternoon the Prime
Minister said he was glad to announce that matters
in connection with the administration of the national
hotels were on a most satisfactory basis. It was
true that the cooks and waiters were still on strike
throughout Victoria, Queensland, N.S.W., Westralia
and Sou. Stralia, but as travellers nowadays carried
stoves with them no inconvenience had been caused.
In Tasmania the housemaids had declined an offer of
£7 a week, and were demanding £7 Is. 6d.; but as
tourists and commercial travellers invariably had
bed linen and stretchers in their luggage the situa-
tion was not by any means serious. A new log had
been prepared for submission to the Amalgamated
Society of Barmen providing for a piece-work rate
of 6d. per drink, and it was expected that this would
be accepted. Some difficulty had occurred in negotia-
tions with the various staff's owing to the hotel mana-
gers having struck, but a new system of slot
machines had been installed in all the hotels, and it
was not intended to have any more managers. The
motto of the Government was to trust the people.
The report of the Auditor-General for the year
showed a loss of £756,892 16s. Bd., which it was
proposed to recover by issuing Treasury Bills and
increasing death duties with exemption up to £5 in
the case of returned soldiers. The great success
which the employees have enabled the Government to
make of this Socialistic experiment has encouraged
the Ministry to now take in hand the nationalisation
of undertakeries.
“R.L.F.”: We’re an inconsistent crowd.
The other day when a batch of soldiers, suf-
fering from venereal disease, escaped from
the isolation camp at Langwarrin, they
travelled to Melbourne by train. The
authorities were horrified, and, to minimise
the danger to the public, the Railway Depart-
ment was bustled round to fumigate the
carriages the men had occupied. Which was
all proper, of course; but when the Govern-
ment is urged to systematically lessen the
danger of contagion by, say, compulsory noti-
fication, it remarks that the time isn’t ripe,
or something equally insane. In consequence
thousands of people rotten with disease
travel in the trains every week, and not in
the ordinary carriages only, but in the sleep-
ing cars. And how often are they disin-
fected?
A VERY DEAD FUNERAL.
MARY: “By cripe, dat phella funeral bin dead long time, mine tinkit.”
In the long series of letters that
passed between the Sydney Coal Lumpers’
I nioii and the Stevedores’ Association
the secretary of the union was formal in
his mode of concluding his epistles until
he forwarded the letter announcing the
determination of his members to strike. A
wave of brotherhood burst over him at that
moment, and he signed himself, “Yours
fraternally. ’ It is a hint to Smith and
Brown and others. When they reach the
conclusion of the acrid correspondence about
the slain dog or the decayed fence they can
turn on the tap, thus: —
My dear Brown, —Referring to your last, at nine
o’clock to-morrow morning I shall pull your nose.—
f ours in eternal friendship, John Smith.
Or
Most esteemed friend,—My various letters to you
having failed to wake in you any sense of decency,
which I therefore presume you do not possess, I will
have very much pleasure in kicking you the length
of the street the next time I see you there.—Yours
very affectionately, Ton Brown.

“Fax”: Three-or four German members of
Melbourne University teaching staff have got
their notice to quit, but Mrs. Wiedermann,
wife of ex-Austrian Consul Pinschof, gets
the benefit of an exception. Gott knows
why. The Wiedermann lady is admittedly
German. She figured on the Melbourne
stage 28 years ago as the star actress in a
dull German comic opera—“Czar und Zim-
mermame” —a one-night show intended (vide
programme) to give the public of Melbourne
“the opportunity of becoming acquainted
with this celebrated work, performed by Ger-
mans in their own language, and thus form-
ing a novel picture in our social life.” The
lady’s proclaimed German-ness is surely not
lessened these times by her being the wife of
a former Consul for Austria. No German
woman can be expected to be unpatriotic.
Everywhere in Melbourne one can hear of
fraus professing their devotion to the Kaiser.
Only the other day the sister of an old-
established German medico declared that,
whereas she had formerly been content with
merely admiring the Kaiser, she now adored
him. If even she had a billet in an Aus-
tralian educational establishment she would
be allowed to keep it on account of her
family connection, no doubt. The question
seems to be: Are we not earning the con-
tempt that the Germans feel for us, even as
a mild Christian earns the contempt of a
biffer whose biffs bring no reprisals?
* * * *
N.S.W. Banco Court has hit to leg an old
idea about wife-maintenance which had
enabled long-distance wife-starvers to clean
their slates rather easily. In August, 1913,
the Law made an order for wife-support
against Lawrence McKiunery. This Lawrence
duly failed to observe, and the Law peace-
fully slumbered until July of this year, when
£95 was due. Then, acting in the common
belief that a penalty under the maintenance
law could not be exacted for more than six
months’ arrears, the magistrate sent McKin-
nery to Long Bay until the sum of £26 was
paid—which meant that the husband would
be put on wages work, and if he behaved
himself would earn about 8s. 6d. per week
above what is charged for his board, so that
he would clear himself of his debt in about
61 weeks. Against this, there was an appeal
on the ground that the magistrate was in
error, the whole amount being recoverable;
and the Banco Court found unanimously
that it is so. The decision in the English
case of Matthews v. Matthews, which had
guided the Sydney magistrate, did not apply,
the Judges said, the N. S. Wales law being
a different beast altogether. Hitherto, when
a man has chanced it and got six months in
arrears, he has always supposed that nothing
mattered then. As he believed he couldn’t
get into more trouble for being two years in
arrears than for being six months behind, he
generally has let things go on indefinitely
cnee the six months’ point was passed. The
new judgment will therefore come as a horri-
ble awakening.
There was a great fuss in the S. Aus.
Parliament lately over the issue of certain
i aw .f o rms from the Government Printer’s

with a German coat-ot-arms and the
motto, “Treu und Fest.” Somebody with
the German jumps made the idiotic sugges-
tion that a traitorous person had introduced
th f e tM Jf , to und ! r “ ine i tbe
Adelaide. But a xefeieuce to Ifould,
Adelaide's old authority on heraldry (now of
the Public Library in Sydney), brings out
that the device is simply that of Queen
victoria’s husband, a sort of Royal Arms

imported to Australia about halt a century
back to add dignity to summonses. The
ONE EXCEPTION.
MABEL: “I feel it in all my bones that I wilt
be an old maid.”
MADGE: “ Not in your wish-bone, dear.”
Prince Consort had leave to “quarter” his
own arms with those of England ; hence the
trouble. Ifould adds shrewdly that at least
as much objection might be taken to the
•Prince of Wales’s arms, which are German
in both origin and motto.
A BUSTED SUMMER POEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lhe summer girl is here again,
All prettiness and pert disdain —-
And, elsewhere, cursing in their pain,
Smashed men are dying in the rain.
In picture-hat and filmy veil
She looks so sweet, so white, so frail,
Why should I think of faces pale
Beneath the sudden shrapnel-hail?
flow fragrant is she, and how French
That perfume faint! Why do I wrench
My thoughts from her to that fierce stench
From putrid bodies in the trench?
Alluringly she flutters by,
This thoughtless little butterfly ;
It seems so strange—l wonder why--
That for her beauty brave men die 1
The shops put on their finery
For her ; she gazes hungrily.
God shield her eyes lest she should see
That graveyard at Gallipoli!
She is so perfect and so sweet,
So very uselessly complete,
Too proud of her white gloves to greet
That rough, maimed soldier on the street.
Along the pave she seems to swim.
A broken man limps by, a grim,
Gaunt wreck of war. Her beauty slim
Is nothing now. I look at him.

The little Italian community in Mel-
bourne has a row all its own. Its
Consul, Cavaliere Emilio Elcs, does his
consulling in the way of a Cavaliere,
and lately Ferrando was driven from
the post of lion. Vice-Consul. Where-
upon the partisans of Ferrando, who is Cava-
liere, too, have petitioned Rome to hold an
inquiry. Meantime the community digs
back into ancestry, and seeks to prove that
this one or that isn’t Italiano at all, but
the grandson maybe of an Austrian cavalry
officer; and Eles is whipping up a counter
petition, and it is expected that when the
Quirinal hears of the rumpus a force of
Bersaglieri will at the very least be hurried
to the scene.
HIS O.C.
“There you are—in that ridiculous cap
again!"
“Sorry, Colonel’s orders.”
“Colonel be bothered! Have you got to do
everything he tells you?"
“Carfax” : The yarns told by Sydney coal-
lumpers about the vast amount of horribly-
expensive food they have to consume in con-
sequence of the laborious nature of their
work, remind me of Waistband. We were
on an electioneering tour, Waistband and I,
and pulled up at the first pub in time for
the evening meal. “It’s very wearing work
this, my boy,” said Waistband as he fell on
the viands, and I give you my word he
cleaned up that shoulder -of mutton, a bottle
of pickles, two dishes of vegetables and a
tapioca pudding 18 inches square like a
tradesman. An hour later he addressed the
multitude upon the growing extravagance of
the Working Classes, and then felt ready
for a bottle of beer, seven ham sandwiches,
and a cake. Waistband was in for break-
fast on the early doors, and had mastered
some porridge, two boiled eggs and a smoked
fish when I left him waiting patiently for
a grill and more toast. Yes, he was a great
doer was Waistband, and I won’t forget the
night he broke a couple of ribs and I drove
the palpitating flesh eight miles over a rough
road to the doctor —and heard him curse
every five minutes because there was no cold
meat in the sulky. Yet Waistband never did
a day’s manual work in his life, nor moved
except with the slow deliberation of a prize
ox. He just chewed his way from the
cradle to the grave. The story about work
having any relation to appetite won’t do.
Mo, bookmaker, eats twice as much as
Rivetts, boilermaker. And McGoorty, pug,
less than either of them.

“G.D.M.”: I believe I’m the only non-
combatant outside Flanders who knows the
smell and the suffocation of chlorine gas,
and my name when I met both these things
was very nearly Outsky. I was picking
up a few wrinkles about chemistry and
metallurgy at the Bendigo School of Mines,
and my mates were four young medical
students in their first year. Edward Lloyd
Marks, well known to old Bendigonians,
was the chemist in charge, and he was teach-
ing me how to make chlorine gas, using
hydrochloric acid on permanganate of
potash. The retort had a flaw and burst
while I was doing something to the Bunsen
burner. Old Marks roared "Put out the
Bunsen!” Putting out the Bunsen was like
trying to mop up Niagara with a ream of
blotting paper. In 30 seconds I was
asphyxiated, bleached and disinfected. My
medical friends carried me outside, and,
using the instructions for restoring the ap-
parently drowned which appeared in the
Bendigo Advertiser every Saturday for >
years, they got me round. They saved my
life, but I’ve got two white lungs and a sense
of smell for; chlorine gas which I can call up
whenever I' choose. My Heaven will be a
place destitute of that horror, and the Huns
Tophet will be full of nothing else but
chlorine and Huns. Old Marks made me
pav half a guinea for a new retort!
* * *
“T.F.M.” : Admitting that
the late Phillips Fox’s
“Landing of Captain Cook”
is an admirable picture, it
vet betrays an error in one
detail. The Endeavour is
shown at anchor in Bptany
Bay flying the “red duster”
of the British mercantile
marine, and a sailorman of
the party, just ashore, is
trying to overawe Binghi
by means of a similar bit
of bunting. Now. it is true
that a certain division of
Bull’s fighting fleet did fly
the red ensign in Cook’s
day, as another division
sported the blue; but the
Endeavour, though belonging
to the navy, had no connec-
tion with the fighting squad-
rons, and would unques-
tionably have hoisted the
white ensign .on all lawful
occasions. Tlife same emblem
would be displayed at any
functions taking place ashore.
By the way, there is no-
thing said in the journals of
either Cook or Banks to sug-
gest that the landing at
Kurnell was effected in the
ceremonious fashion shown
in this picture and Gilfin-
nan’s. It was at Possession
Island, close to Cape York,
that Cook officially .annexed
the whole eastern coast of
“New Holland.” Cook never
mentions the name “New
South Wales,” and the notion that he origin-
ated the Ma State’s patronymic is merely
one of those numerous delusions that, having-
been given a fair start, are mightly hard to
overtake.
* * * *
Joffre continues his nibblings in the Cham-
pagne district: —
“Harrison O.” : Is it not time we ceased
wasting money on that absurd theatrical
prop., the sword? The ridiculous piece of
cutlery is, of course, never taken into battle,
and is too awkward to use as a tooth-pick or
tin-opener; yet every man holding officer’s
rank receives an allowance so that he may
buy one. These swords, prettily engraved
on the flat, are imported from England and
cost, ou an average, £7 7s. Hundreds of
officers—many of them going uierely to jobs
in Cairo—swank away with the useless iron-
mongery dangling by their side; but those
who are sent to the Front are ordered to
leave such superfluous sundries behind them
in Egypt.
THE ACCIDENT TO THE BOOKMAKER.
“Did Berty win on that last race?"
“I think so. I saw him apologising to the bookmaker."
As . usual, it is the silent outbacker with
warts on his hands and gold in his heart
who is taking this war-talk about the need
for economy seriously. Victoria has just
had a fine instance of it. The other morn-
ing a cheque for £2B-odd dropped into the
Mines Department. With it came a letter
reminding the Minister that in May last two
prospectors in the Omeo district had applied
for a Government loan to enable them to
carry on. For two and a half years they
had been battling in the hills trying to
locate a lode they felt sure was there, and
ac last, when on the verge of starvation,
they had turned to the Government. The
Department made them a grant of £B5. For
the barest tucker they drew £2B; and then
they got on to it, and from 50 tons they had
just knocked out 1540 z. of gold. In notify-
ing the Minister of their luck, they asked
permission to repay the £2B with interest,
“Someone else might peed it,” they added,
with a fine simplicity which ought to make
a lot of noisier patriots blush.
“Alamon” : Another advt. for the Northern
Territory, where the climate leaps on the
white resident and knocks the spirit out of
him—and especially her. From a total
population of 4000-odd, including Chinese,
Japanese and sundries, nearly 150 white boys
have enlisted, and over £lO,OOO has been
subscribed for Red Cross and similar funds.
Also, hundreds of articles have been made
and sent away by the women. On Australia
Day Territorians contributed an average of
oCer £1 a head, which tops the poll for Aus-
tralia ; but as the men, money and goods are
added to the lists of different States, the N.T.
will get no credit. On this account, I’m
anticipating that some Southern Tory paper
will in a few years point to the North as the
ope place in Australia that did nothing to
help the nation in the war, and remark that,
apart from other considerations, such inertia
proves that the Territory should be manned
by cheap, bob-tailed uigger.

When the coal-lumping difficulty was at
its worst in Port Jackson, and even the tran-
sports could not obtain supplies, R.M.S.
Niagara, Australasia’s biggest steamship,
swung out from her berth, America-bound,
exactly to schedule time. She is an oil-
burner and independent of the whims 'of the
coalies, who might find some food for reflec-
tion in the incident. The use of oil fuel
presents some problems that have not been
altogether solved, but items such as coal-
lumpers’ strikes in defiance of Arbitration
principles will spur on those interested to
overcome the difficulties. When that lias
been done the coal-heaver will have plenty of
time to whip the cat.

“Snell”: My neighbor Cadman is something
of a mechanical genius when off duty. On
duty he occupies a tall pedestal in a city
gas office. Free of his daily labors he
messes with cranks of a different kind in a
little workshop of his own. It was there
the Cadman Electric Lawn Mower was de-
vised. Cadman’s lawn-mower is run by a
motor, and it buzzes all over a lawn, cutting
grass of its own initiative practically. All
Cadman does is sit on the verandah, with
a wire in his hand, and give it a call when
he wants the machine to turn right or left,
or back up, or run in rings. The other
Sunday morning I heard a great disturbance
outdoors, and presently the girl dashed in,
with hair and eyes expressive of profound
emotion. “Oh. sir!” she gasped. "Ob.
mum ! It’s Cadman’s lawn-mower — it’s
escaped," I went out. Our neighbor’s
machine had taken a violent turn. It had
torn a way into Banks’s garden on the off
side; it had demolished Banks’s bed of
pansies; it had bitten the lobe off Mrs.
Banks’s left ear, and when I arrived on the
scene it was chasing a pale but energetic
churchman down the asphalted road. Cad-
man, who was following, overtook the
mower, and fell on it. A great scrap
followed, in the course of which the
owner used a lot of language un-
suitable to the day. When Cadman re-
turned, carrying the subdued lawn-mower, he
was bleeding in four places, and his copious
How of whiskers was gone from one side of
his face. He looked at me sadly; he made
a brave effort to smile. “After all,” he
said, “I think I’ll patent it as Cadman’s
Automatic Barber.”
BULLY BEEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Do you know the soldier’s curse—
Plagues of Egypt, only worse?
Not the tricks the Germans show,
Not the dying, cold and slow,
Not the flies that will not go,
But this concrete soul of grief—
Bully beef !
Worse than bombs that bore and butt,
Bullets chipping at your nut,
Worse than Abdul drunk with blood,
Worse than drought and worse than flood,
Worse than dossing in the mud,
Blight from which there’s no relief —•
Bully beef!
Snowball in his gravy thin,
Poley sitting in a tin ;
Working bullocks red and brown
From the tracks to Mulga Town,
Boiled, and rammed, and soldered down,
Scorned by black or brindled thief —
Bully beef!
Beastly is the war-time smell,
Like a porpoise fried in Hell;
Awful is the strain of war,
Horrible its rending roar;
But the soldier knows no bore
Like this anguish past belief—-
Bully beef!
Game a little present through
Sent, to me, my love, by you!
What 1 fondly wish you, dear,
Would if whispered in your ear
Curdle you with mortal fear;
Neatly bound, with message brief—-
BULLY BEEF!
SOMEWHERE.
BILLY KHAKI.
Now the Hun is on the move,
Victory is drawing near;
So the Champagne yet may prove
Just a sort of German bier!

Mr. Fisher, having announced to the party that he desired to resign the leadership, his resignation was accepted with great regret, and a full recognition of the very

Peter Bowling, who made fame for
himself as an irreconcilable coal-miners’
leader, is figuring in a new role ; and as a
recruiting speaker he still gets the cheers.
Two of Peter’s sous have already gone to
the war, two have been turned down, and
Peter himself was denied only because
h 1 was 51. Tlie other day he made a sport-
ing offer to the crowd that if 20 men signi-
fied their willingness to enlist he would go
along with them and try again. Thirty-
six responded, so Peter booked himself
for another attempt. And in spite of his
years a lot of the men who have got through
have less activity.
The first stage of Andrew Fisher’s jouruev
to London will be overland from Port Aug-
usta to Perth. “320 miles of desert being
traversed with a couple of camels.” At the
conclusion of this Hilarious Pilgrimage the
camels are expected to have the bump more
than ever.
A man who had no reason to
regard Australia as a worn-oul sort of place
passed out the other day in Sydney—James
Henderson, who made the lollies that
hear his name. He was 47 when he came
lo Sydney from Scotland 24 years ago, and
tour years later he was working, with a
boy to help him. in a little shed opposite
the Victoria Barracks, Paddington. Then
he struck tlie idea of calling some of the
stuff he manufactured, mainly from honey,
“kisses, - and wrapping ii in paper with
tender sentiments printed upon it. The
sentimental stickiness struck popular fancy,
and now the Henderson sweet business is
one of the largest in Australia.
COULDN'T ESCAPE
ONE GIRL: “We got engaged as soon as ever
he came back."
THE O THER: "Poor fellow —it was a leg lie
lost, wasn't it?"
in the last hatch of gazetted Expedition-
ary officers is Lieut. W. B. Dailey, of the
Field Artillery, in camp at National Park,
Sydney. Dailey, an English barrister with
literary tendencies, is a son of the man who
was responsible for Australia's first mili-
iary expedition—the one that set out be-
latedly for the Soudan and brought back
the historical donkey. The reward of Wil-
liam Bede Dailey, senior, was a Privy Coun-
cillorship, the first sent to these parts. Out
ot that expedition also sprang, by the way.
.Hops Little Boy Irom Manly, siijce used
in a thousand drawings to represent Young
Australia.
Corporal Bassett’s V.C. is the third won
by Maoriland. The first was awarded in the
Native War of 1563-4, when Major Charles
Ileaphy earned it. As Ileaphy was not a
“regular,” the old gentlemen who decide
these things had to be pressed hard before
they would agree to give the Cross to a
mere “colonial”; but he got it, though any
later deeds that merited reward were “re-
cognised” by a special Cross designed for the
occasion. The next Maorilander V.C. was
Hardham, a blacksmith from Wellington.
He rescued a comrade under heavy fire at
a S'African place with a nasty-looking name
and was also promoted to a commission. He
is at the Dardanelles now, and has been
wounded there. Bassett got the decoration
for laying field telephones under heavy tire.
THE HAGGLE ABOUT A WORD.
THE RECRUTING OFFICER: "Young man,, are
you on going to volunteer coluntarily. or
ahall I hare In make you?"
Last week tlie N.S.W. Supreme Court
admitted to practice Charles Throsby Young,
whose grandfather, Adolphus William Young
was admitted to the same court just 77
years ago. Later on. grand-dad was Sheriff
of the colony 11842 till 1849) ; and still
later, having accumulated much wealth, he
became a member of the House of,Commons,
silting first for Yarmouth and afterwards
for Helstone.
A send-off to one of the best sort:—
Syd Day, very well known in three States for his
pluck and good humor, passed out on Thursday,
aged 48. lie liad survived many adventures in a
varied career, but succumbed to a meningitis germ.
Born in London, he went to New York as a boy,
and got a job as printer of labels in a patent-medi-
cine factory. Out of curiosity he tried some of the
medicine. It gave him a toothache, and he went
to the dentist’s, but funked at the door, and walked
down to the East River Wharves, where he saw the
clipper ship .Jumna about to sail for Sydney. Ilis
resentment against the, patent medicine and the nag-
ging tooth was so strong that he instantly decided
to leave America and try Australia. To that end
he spent a good deal of his small stove of money in
filling the fir-t mate with beer, and was eventually
taken on as a sailor before the mast. The first
mate treated him so badly on the voyage that he
was very glad to quit the ship at Sydney, with
70 cents in his pocket. He went on the vaudeville
stage and made a reputation as a singer of coster
songs; but the printing business offered better re-
turns, and he started in a small way at Albert
Park, Melbourne, llis first plant cost about £7O,
and was set up in a lean-to at the hack of the
house. Thenceforward he progressed steadily, and
became the best pester printer and one of the best
all-round men in the trade, with offices in Mel-
bourne, Sydney and Adelaide. As a sportsman he
was widely known and admired. In the early days
of motor-reliability trials he put up splendid
records; he won several motor-cycle races; caught
the largest cod ever taken out of the Murray, and
raced a yacht with great credit and a fair amount
of success. One yacht race that he might have won
he abandoned in order to help a competitor in
distress. That was characteristic of Syd Day. lie
was a “sport” in the hot sense of the word. As
a. Idler of stories there were few to beat him. his
powers of mimicry greatly helping his keen sense of
humor. Someone asked him why he did not print
his first name in full, as more dignified. "No,” he
answered. “ ‘Syd Day’ is short, quick, bright; it
suits me and suits the business." It did, and all
who knew him will miss his radiant personality.
"Nemo”: Justice Gussen. of Victoria, lias
been up at the Bar of the State Parliament,
to be thanked by both Houses for consolidat-
ing the Statutes. I was present in the
Assembly a quarter of a century ago when
George Higinbotham, then Chief Justice,
appeared at the Bar to be thanked for per-
forming the same great task in relation to
the Acts of Parliament up to that date.
Indeed, Higinbotham had done the job twice
—first in 1860, and then again in 1800. A
little table was put across the entrance to the
House, replacing the Bar, and here Tligin-
botham sat in Judge's full-bottomed wig
and scarlet gown. In other days, rising
from the Treasury Bench, the little man had
made big speeches which I often helped to
report—speeches that made the House ring
with their fine, forcible English. Now, in
spite of all his services, he couldn’t, for the
life of him, get beyond the Bar. C’ussen was
ou less familiar ground. Pie was trained to
put things into order as an engineer. The
law was the second striug to his bow: rail-
way-survey work filled the pot until he was
well on to 30.
Dr. Ramsay Mailer, the large, broad,
square jawed specialist you go to with frayed
nerves, backed by a “syndicate,” has given
the Vic. Red Gross Society the use of a con-
valescent home for soldiers at Burwood.
which is a rural village three or four miles
on the countryside of Toorak. The retreat,
a large, beautiful dwelling in a large, beauti-
ful garden, has been equipped and staffed by
the “syndicate,” and will be conducted free
of ex;vnse to the society. It is designed par-
ticulaily for men with the kind of shaken
nerves that Dr. Mailer knows most about.
The busiest motor-car in the service of the
home belongs to Mrs. Mailer’s sister —Mrs.
Henry Andrews—who has turned herself
into a general transport officer.
Dead in England, at 70, R. G. Wilkinson,
a long-standing advertisement for the .climate
of Australia. Half a century ago he was
considered a “goner” in London, and was
merely sent here for a voyage on the off-
chance. A generation back he was manager
of the National Bank in S.A.; then of the
Bank of Adelaide: after that, he was chair-
man of the latter’s directorate in London.
He lias left one son in Australia—-Alfred,
head of the wholesale grocery-house which
began in Adelaide and spread east and west.
The morning after Kink O’Malley was
restored to his throne in Home Affairs In'
was at the office at 8.30 and signed on, as is
his usual clown custom. At 0.5 a line was
drawn and all late-comers had to sign in red
ink. This is more of the “brotherhood” flap-
doodle. of course. Regulations say that
administrative officers need not sign on or
off. But the King wants to show that lie is
as good as the junior messenger.
An Australian who made good in England
has just passed out —the Rev. Stuart Alex-
ander Donaldson. D.D., master of Magdalen
College, Cambridge, since 190-1. He was
born at Kellett House, Darlinghurst, in
1854. and was son of the first N.S.W.
Premier under Responsible Government. A
younger brother is Dr. Donaldson, Areh-
bish. of Brisbane.
SYMPATHY!
THE BORE: "I was prepared to go and he
shot, but they wouldn’t let me.”
THE BORED: "How inconsiderate!”
The lottery of war. Two sons of Ilowell-
Price. Anglican clergyman at Waterloo, a
Sydney suburb, went with Australia’s first
expedition. Both fought valiantly. One,
Captain Owen G. lloweil-Price, gained the
D. 5.0.; the other the crown of death, which
may be nobler than all.
DR. LANG, the T.A.T.C. handicapper, tch
succeeded Kelly Maitland.
Webster, the new Postmaster-General, has
been doing his little bit to encourage Young
Australia to get a gun. Webster is by way
of being a poet, and heard the muse a-calling
the other day with such persistence that
he sent the result to the Moree News. A
verse : —•
Would you rather part from those you love,
Or see them raped or slain?
Wait till our boys > ihe sea they shove
Or wipe out the k..iser’s stain.
Shall civilisation be submerged
’Neath the heel of the tyrant’s foot?
Is it not time the world was purged
Of the law of lust and loot?
It is. The time is also ripe for drowning
somebody beneath the thumb of the oppres-
sor’s hand.
A. rolling stone whose name was apparently
shortened by attrition in its travels is Frank
Luks. formerly Lukschewitz, who, though
only ”2. has worked bis way from bis
mother's cottage in Richmond < Vic.) to
Norway, by way of the Russian fortress-
prison of St. Peter and St.
Paul, in Petrngrad the same
stone jug which once held those
fiery spirits, General Stoessel.
of Port Arthur, and Admiral
Niebogatoff, outed by the Brown
Men in the battle of the Sea
of Japan. Luks was formerly
on the training ship John Mur-
ray, probably owing to the fact
that his adventurous career
headed him in that direction.
As a lad he worked his way
to Fremantle, Buenos Ayres.
Libau. Sweden and Southamp-
ton. Homesick, he stole a pas-
sage between the inner and outer
funnels of a liner. Discovered,
lie stowed away in the refriger-
ating chamber of another ves-
sel. and turned up at Richmond
with ■‘Hullo, mum. Fm back
again.” Alining at the Barrier
and saving his screw, lie
planned to study aviation in
England. After (lights there
and in the U.S., he volplaned
back to Sydney and thence to
France. The British Govern-
ment declined bis services as
an airman, and he closed with
an offer from Russia, nut on
the border of Finland tin' word
"Australia” on bis passport was
read as "Austria,” and lie was imprisoned.
When released lie was crippled by cold and
thinned by a diet; of black bread and water.
When last heard of he was in Norway, and
promising his mol her to be “as famous as
Nelson” some day.
Mats off to this record ! A woman applied
to the Defence Dept, at Wellington t.M.i-'
the other day for a pass to enable her to get
on to the wharf to witness the departure of
certain reinforcements. Asked, as usual, if
she were the next-of-kin of a soldier, she
answered: "I bad eight sons. Seven of them
have gone to the Front. Four have been

My last boy is going to-day.” She got the
pass.
Five strapping young bush men who were
mates at Whatatutu (M.L.) tossed in the
job they were at a year ago and enlisted in
a body in the first M.L. reinforcements.
They managed to hang together and event-
ually got into the thick of the disturbance
side by side. Their names were Dellow.
Masters, O’Brien, Nelson and Green. News
is now through that the first four have all
been killed and Green has been badly
wounded. The bush is doing its bit, as it
always does.
WHERE COURAGE LIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Married Woman.” writing to the papers, says
she lias Small respect for those women who have any
patience with their husbands in pleading' marriage
as an excuse for not enlisting. "My husband went
with the first —I saw to that," she says.
I knew him as a miJdish man,
.V packer up at ITankin’s mill.
To war his timid comments ran —-
lie thought it horrible to plan
One's harmless fellow men to kill.
I saw him Thursday, khaki-clad;
A rifle at his side bore he;
His aspect, though not wholly glad,
M as not as sheepish nor as sad
As in those days ’tivas wont to be.
“You thought you were not game, I know,
Yet here you are,” 1 paused to say.
“I'm married since,” he said, “and so
I'm going; but 1 wouldn't go
If I was game enough to stay!”

That last line shows too big a shrinkage to
disregard; yet it isn’t more than visible
circumstances satisfactorily explain. In
fact, a bank which can stand up to probably
the worst drought ever known in the parts
where it does business and simultaneously
to the worst war that ever was and still
show a profit of 7 p.c. on prefs. and 20 p.c.
on ordinaries may reckon itself very lucky.
Certainly nearly everything depends on
whether the bank has made proper provision
for contingencies. It does nobody any good
to forget that immediately before the big
boom broke in Melbourne 20-odd years ago
banks were showing record profits, and
some of them were paying over 20 p.c. divi-
dends. The National itself was paying 15
p.c. The trouble which then followed was
due chiefly to (1) the sudden demand for
the repayment of foreign deposits, and (2)
the attempt to realise securities in order to
meet that demand. Bad seasons, rabbits
and low prices helped. The influence of low
prices on the disasters of those days has been
rather overlooked. Between 1889 and 1894
there was a fall of no less than 82 p.c. in
the average value of Australian exports. And
the 1889 values were by no means high:
they were about 20 p.c. lower than those of
1880. Average merino wool in the London
market was down to (id. per lb. in 1894, and
in the same year wheat averaged there 225.
lOd. a quarter—that is, 2s. lOd. per bushel:
absolutely less than it will cost this year to
market the stuff from Australia.
What are the chances of seeing such
things again? The bimetallist said (and
this writer believes him) that the stock of
gold had got too small to carry the world’s
trade; hence the world was prepared to give
very little of the scarce metal in exchange
for other commodities. The discoveries in
the Rand, Westralia and Canada altered all
that. Down to 1890 the world’s annual har-
vest of gold had been for many years from
four to four and a half million ounces. Then
a remarkable revival began, and almost
every year saw another million ounces added
to the yield until in 1908 the 20-million-
ounce mark was passed. S’Africa is now
alone turning out almost twice as much gold
as the world turned out altogether prior to
1890. On as close a calculation as can be
made, there is now £220 worth of gold in
the world for every £lOO there was in 1890.
In other words, we have more than doubled
the world’s stock of gold. And gold is our
standard of value. There may be special
reasons why this or that commodity should
have an unusually poor market; but the
general price levels prevailing in the early
’9o’s seem to be altogether impossible under
the changed conditions as to gold. And that
removes the greatest financial danger Aus-
tralia is up against. Consider what it would
mean if, instead of getting Is. for its wool.
Australia had to send away wool at 6d. to
pay interest on its public debt of nearly
£400.000,000. Consider what it means to
be able to pay with one ton of lead the
interest that we formerly had to produce two
tons to pay! The luckiest thing that ever
happened to Australia was the discovery of
the Rand, Westralia and other goldfields
20-odd years ago. But for that we should
by this time have worn our noses very sharp
at the grindstone. The misfortune is that
Australia’s good luck has been seized by the
loan-mongers to load the country up with a
debt which it wouldn’t have been able to
look at had the old prices for our staples
been maintained.
There is going to be very heavy taxation,
of course; and that taxation will leave us
with much diminished net incomes. But so
long as prices are high (as they are likely
to be) the Australian turnover will be
large; and it is on turnover that the banks
make their money—they earn a bit even on
what we have to send to England to pay
interest with. To some extent they will
suffer from taxation; but their individual
shareholders will have to pay the bulk of it.
On the whole- then, this paper doesn’t take
a gloomy view of the outlook for Australian
banks.
Some time ago the National backed its
opinion that Australia was going to have a
run of good years; and the policy, though
it seemed almost reckless at the time, was
a great success. Its business has rattled
along: 10 years ago its advances were
£5,378,880, and now they are £9,229,642.
Meantime it has been so absolutely certain
of its securities that it has on two occasions
disclosed inner reserves—profits which had
been quietly put by to meet contingencies.
Yet it may still have its bad debts. Landed
securities, for instance, have been shrinking
and will no doubt shrink further, if only as
the result of taxation. But there is not
going to be anything very sudden about it;
and it is the sudden slump on the unproduc-
tive property that makes a bank wonder
why it was born.

All things considered, the last half-year’s
profit was surprisingly good; for war and
drought were both tugging the figures down.
Those two things between them must have
made far more difference in exchange earn-
ings alone than the £l5OO or so by which
the profits have shrunk. Six months ago
bills and remittances in transit and in Lon-
don totalled £861,936; now the item stands
at only £361,066. There has also been a
shrinkage in advances. Certainly loans are
dearer ; but that isn’t all profit, for deposits
are getting dearer, too. Banks are, how-
ever, scoring a bit in that respect, because
interest on deposits has not advanced in
the same proportion as the interest de-
manded on more fixed investments. In the
present uncertainty plenty of people with
money at command prefer that somebody
else should take the risk; hence they are
content to let the banks have the safe cus-
tody of their surplus funds at a rate not
much in advance of what ruled in less tem-
pestuous times. Fortunately the banks
have been able to use a good deal of the
money to their own advantage and the
nation’s. Six months ago the Colonial, for
instance, had only £101,158 in public securi-
ties of all kinds. Since then the bank’s
small holding of consols has been turned
into £386,000 worth of British War Loan
debentures, and the bank was an applicant
also for a parcel of Australian war stock.
By-and-bye some of the money which has
been left with the bank—for safe custody
as much as anything—may be wanted; but
that isn’t likely to cause any embarrass-
ment, because there will be a fine cheque
coming in for wheat and wool very soon.
Victoria, like N. S. Wales, promises to reap
a record grain harvest; and though freights
and insurance are deadly, running up to
3s. a bushel or thereabouts, the English
market, which governs also our own, is firm
enough to show about 4s. to the Australian
producer. As for wool, the clip will be cut
into by last season's drought losses; but the
market is far better than seemed possible
12 months ago.
The 12 months’ movements in the
Colonial’s balance-sheet figures are shown
next: —

Liquid assets, which of course include those
war-loan investments already mentioned,
represent 42 p.c. of the liabilities to the
public; and depositors ought to be quite
satisfied with that proportion. The share-
holders’ funds, which in the last resort are
the creditors’ guarantee, also seem to be
quite adequate: the creditors’ principal
would be all right even if the securities
were worth only three-fourths of what the
bank has advanced on them, and there is
no reason whatever to expect any such
shrinkage as that. Victorian values have
not been inflated by boom-borrowing to
anything like the same extent as those of
N. S. Wales ; and heavy production for two
or three years will do great things in steady-
ing the market against the depreciation-
which will be the natural result of heavy
war-taxes. That above all is the thing to
be aimed at —production. Not employment
of men on loan works. That is no good,
though it is the dope the Holman Govern-
ment is administering to N. S. Wales.

It is a pleasure to overhaul these accounts,
they are so well presented ; and the directors’
remarks go so directly to the heart of the
things that matter. But the co. has some-
thing better even than well-presented ac-
counts to show. Ten years back £49,039 of
its capital was “paper.” Now it has
£84,255 of reserves. In 10 years the co.
has thus laid by £133,294. To start with it
had in 1902 £72,377 of its capital represented
by goodwill and other intangible assets. To-
day it has all its capital of £350,000 intact
and £84,255 in tangible assets besides. Mean-
time, as far as can be judged, assets sub-
ject to depreciation, such as leaseholds and
plant, have been kept well written down.
The performance is all the more satisfac-
tory because very nearly half the capital is
in freeholds and leaseholds, mostly city
property; and you can’t expect a big return
from investments like that. Only two things
have made it possible for a co. with half
its capital thus secured to save up 40 p.e.
of its capital in 10 years—(l) the fact that
three-sevenths of the capital carries only
0 p.c. interest; (2) the other fact that the
directors have kept the div. on the rest of
the capital down to 8 p.c. at the most.
Marcus Clark and Co. carry on a large
time-payment as well as ordinary counter-
sales business; and time-payment trading
calls for a heap of money. This shows the
various assets

Total £563,319; and the capital and re-
serves (prior to paying the current divi-
dend) were £446,755, so that the co. had
to borrow o£, incur other liabilities of
£116,564. Theie,latter figures look pretty
large; but you have to remember, on the
other hand, that the co. has over £165,000
in freeholds and leaseholds.
The rather surprising thing is that book
debts should now be about £lO,OOO more than
they were a couple of years ago, when the
world seemed a pleasant place to pitch a
tent in. You would say at once that it
was quite wrong policy to give more credit
in a time like this. But, seriously, whose
wages have been reduced—in Australia,
that is? A few metal-mine workers have,
been thrown out of a job; but even at
Broken Hill, where the firstfruits of the war
were bitter, the miners have lately been
given an extra shilling a day, and now
want a 44-hours week. All over the place
there are strikes for higher wages, and de-
mands for bonuses on top of current wages
awards. These are the people who supply
most of the time-payment customers; and
they are rather better able to keep up pay-
ments than they were even in prosperous
1913. llow it is going to be two years
hence is another matter. When the soldier
comes back to work, and when the borrow-
ing and spending are over and the repaying
starts, labor will find itself squeezed. How
this co. will get on then depends upon the
care with which t.p. customers are being
chosen now. That it will suffer in the
volume of business, even if it can escape bad
debts, seems inevitable. The directors say
that already drought and war “have con-
siderably reduced the public spending power.”
Drought has certainly reduced the public
spending power ; but thus far the war has
increased the people’s spending power; for
besides having the proceeds of ordinary pro-
duction to spend, the country has had the
spending of the vast amount of loan money
which war preparations have called for.
Traders should not deceive themselves. They
are really in clover now; but later on they
will find it far harder work to shift their
stocks.

Liabilities . . . . . . . . 16,996 29,945
Surplus apart from stock . . £38,474 £126,455
Meantime no new share capital has been
got in. Assuming, then, that stock and
plant are worth as much now as they were
10 years ago, the co., besides paying its very
fine dividend, has made a surplus profit of
£87,981, which is equal to more than half
of the capital actually paid. Whether stock
and plant have really been drawn upon to
provide some of these other assets The
Bulletin doesn’t know. The published
balance-sheet lumped them at £89,540 in
1905 and puts them at £85,705 now. View-
ing all the circumstances, however, this paper
would be surprised to learn that the business
carries less stock than it did in 1905.
But note that the comparisons so far
made have covered a 10-year period. The
margin over and above the dividend has been
much narrower lately. Which way is it
likely to go? The Bulletin says, in con-
nection with some other post mortem, that
war had not begun to affect that business
yet—except perhaps to increase it. That
remark cannot, however, be applied univer-
sally. While as a rule the wages man is
not yet suffering from the war, there are
plenty of business men who are; and it
looks as though all through the piece the
latter will suffer most. And that gives some
indication of the kind of trading house that is
likely to also suffer most: it won’t be the one
which handles the wages-man’s bread-and-
butter lines so much as those which deal in
what are luxuries more or less. Washington
Soul's belong to the latter class. Which
recalls that in 1904 and thereabouts, on the
same actually paid capital as at present
(though the accumulated profits were less;
of course), the half-yearly profits averaged
rather less than £7OOO.

This co. was formed 81 years back to take
over the business founded in Dunedin by
Bendix llallenstein, whose family interests
are still represented on the Board. Pro-
gress for a long while was slow ; you can
guess that from the fact that, after 28
years, the reserves were only about £28.000,
notwithstanding that dividends had been
kept very modest. Of recent years things
have moved faster; but the management has
still kept a tight rein on dividends, and as
a result reserves now make a very good
showing—they have been nearly doubled in
five years.
The original capital was under £BO,OOO.
As the business grew up and spread out and
the management adopted a policy of perma-
nently housing itself in its own freeholds,
the capital was steadily increased to
£241.789, including £125,000 in pref. shares.
Of this money no less than £155,280 is in
warehouses, etc. With so much of the cap-
ital invested in property, most of it bought
or provided in recent years, anything im-
pressive in the way of a return on capital
is almost out of the question. You can’t
have both the security of city property and
the return you naturally expect to get when
you take big trading risks. In this case,
after providing for the prefs., there is about
11 p.c. available for the ordinaries; and
they certainly can’t growl at that—assum-
ing, of course, that proper provision has
been, made for depreciation and bad debts.
Twelve months ago those debts looked much
too big, and this paper felt a little uncom-
fortable and made some comparisons with
the credit given by Australian firms in the
same line. It is glad to see now that the
outstandings have been very substantially
reduced. This shows that and other fea-
tures of the accounts :

The reduction of the book debts lias enabled
the co. to reduce its own liabilities from
£66,002 to £29,571. The only thing better
than that would be their reduction by a
further £25,000 or thereabouts. The out-
look is too uncertain to make big book
debts comfortable —especially when those
debts mean that you’ve got to get credit
yourself. All round there is too much credit
iu Maoriland ; and the more it has piled up
the higher land-values have gone, and the
higher land-values have gone the more
credit has been asked for. Thus a vicious
circle has been established. There is going
to be a burst some day, and the people who
will then suffer least are those who have
stuck closest to cash trading.

Policies are written against burglary, plate-

out of the Vic. Workers’ Compensation Act
passed last year. The basis of the co. is
co-operative, and the results are a splendid
advt. for that system. There are 270 manu-
facturers. including the corporate Chamber,
interested ; and they send their business along
without canvass. They are thus trying to
get the advantages of Socialism, by knock-
ing out Private Enterprise and saving its
profits, while keeping the concern under
business management—which last is wherein
Socialism so often fails. One result of the
loyalty of the co-operators is that the expense
rate is an amazingly small 10 p.c., which
represents a saving of at least 20 p.c.; and
co-operators in other spheres could save just
as much if they would loyally send their
business to their own concern, and thus cut
out the horde of canvassers and collectors
and their travelling exes. Net premium
income was £81.907; add interest £1080;
total revenue. £32,987. This is cut up as

reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

diiring the first year of a co.’s life, and that
some of them have probably 11 months and
more to run. The provision for unexpirtd
risks is, of course, merely an estimate; but
the two lines combined added to expenses
represent—theoretically at any rate the
charges for a full 12 months against the
year’s revenue. In other words, theoreti-
cally the profit for last year was £lO, <96,
which, after allowing 7 p.c. — a fair thing
on the capital, means 28 p.c. on the premium
income. That holds out splendid promise of
much-reduced rates to the co-operative in-
surers. And their principal is quite sate.
All of it, in fact, is in either Government or

So the co. has now declined to a 6 p.c. divi-

reserves. In spite of the gradually dimin-
ishing distribution the past 10 years’ his-
tory, considered from another point of view,
has been worse than the foregoing table

In the bad old boom days the dividend aver-
aged 16 p.c.—it was as high as IS p.c. for
(our consecutive terms. Then from 1896
the co. settled down to a steady 12 p.c., and
accumulated a substantial reserve. By and
bye, the inevitable electrical competitor
arrived in Bendigo, and —well, the two lots
of figures printed above illustrate that things
are not what they used to be. And they
never will be again.
“Mineral,” on the tin-smelting question: —
r Wild Cat Column (30/9/Y5) concludes some com-
ments on “Stannum’s” relation of his experiences in
N.Q. tin deals by saying, “Impose an export duty,
an.d there will be enough ore available to keep one
or two more Australian tin .works going', and the
resultant competition will be all to the tin-
catcher’s good.” But listen! The tin miner,
unlike the copper or lead miner, turns out a product
that is already within 25 p.c. or 30 p.c. metal, so
that the operation of turning this product into pure
metal is not an extensive one, and gives employ-
ment to a mere handful of operatives. The existing
three smelting works in Australia could treat all the
output with little or no addition to plant, and the
employment of a couple of dozen more hands. It
can matter very little to these. concerns that a pro-
portion of the tin ore finds its way out of Australia
without passing through their hands ; where the shoe
pinches them is that the exporters’ competition com-
pels the smelters in Australia to pay the tin miners
for their product, and it is solely with the view to not
having to pay the miners nearly so much for their
tin that the smelting cos. are invoking legislation to
demolish the export buyers who, when all is said
and done, are shipping a 70 p.c. and 75 p.c. product
instead of 100 p.c., and to the same ultimate des-
tination —the London market.
Ia plain words, Australia must not get the
work of smelting this tin because the three
(or more) smelting eos. would combine to
swindle the producers. Well, already there
is a law to make things very uncomfortable
fo: inter-State combinations which do that
kind of thing; and if the Referenda ques-
tions are answered with a “Yes” there will
be a lot more power. Meantime Tiie
Bulletin refuses to advise “Mineral” not
to get married because his wife might take
to drink and do other dreadful things.

“F.H.R.” : It’s all very well to decry dish-
prospects (B. 21/10/’l5) ; but what is the
average prospector to do? In N.S.W. there
is the Government assay from the Mines
Dept., which is free—and useless. I know
it shouldn’t be, but the fact remains that a
Mines Dept, assay is treated as a joke by
all prospectors. In any case, people
mislead themselves with assays just as
much as with the dish. All reefs
vary in values, therefore let the prospector
keep a diary •of dish results and pro-
spect fairly along the reef. Take prospects
as good, fair, poor and nil, and average
them up at the end of a week, or, better
still, a month, and the old dish will give a
good working result. Nothing grows in the
brain so fast as gold. My method is to try
the stone I think is poor, as I know the
specimen stuff is all right, and my crush-
ings come up to my expectations.

Associated (W.A.) continues unprofitable.
Since January last the loss on working
account has totalled £6378, and this will
probably be increased by the end of the
year. Nq important developments have
been recorded for a long time, and although
there is always the chance of a turn-up in
such a large area, the prospect isn’t glow-
ing. Dr. Maclaren opined a year or so
ago that with careful exploration and good
fortune the mine would yield its current
returns for at least two years, but results
have fallen short of his expectations.
Ivanhoe (W.A.) has got its main shaft
down to 3500 ft. and is sinking at the rate
of 40ft. a month to the point where a cross-
cut can be driven underneath the porphyry
to see whether the broken lode has once
more become solid and regained its lost
values. Geologist Maclaren estimated that
the lode would pass out of the porphyry at
some point between 3380 ft. and 3760 ft,,
opposite the main shaft, and he saw no
reason why the lode should materially differ
in size, tenor and length of shoot from that
worked above the porphyry. In July last a
depressed bore from the 3320 ft. level struck
the porphyry at 3436 ft. from the surface.
Subsequently it penetrated 6-ift. of ore, and
the core, divided into five sections, assayed
from 12s. 6d. down to Bs. per ton.

South Ivalgurli (W.A.) has been bucking
up a bit lately. Twelve months ago it had
some difficulty to make ends meet. Early
in the new year it turned the corner, and
during the past nine months profits have
averaged £2248 per month.
* * * *
From a man on the spot:—
lie Fraser’s line, Southern Cross, which a Mel-
bourne crowd is trying to float. Fraser’s was a
good and Well-managed mine 17 years ago. In
those days there was a main shaft which was
always being deepened, and the mine was kept well
ahead of the mill. The progressive boss, however,
left to take a better job, and his successor stopped
sinking and other development, in order to show
how much cheaper he could run the show. Later
on, a syndicate, mostly Kalgoorlie mine managers,
acquired the property, and bogged in for all it was
worth. All the residues on the surface and all the
ore that could be gouged out underground were
treated; and when there was nothing left the mine
was let on tribute. Kalgoorlie mine managers may
be all right when working for others, but those who
got hold of Fraser’s proved themselves to be a set
of pig-rooting vandals. It is exceedingly doubtful
whether what remains is worth the cost of extrac-
tion.
*. * # *
Lake View and Star (W.A.) was lately
robbed of £2500 worth of gold, and is thus
only able to show a profit of £354 for the
month. An investigation revealed systematic
and extensive theft from the treatment
plant. Mineowners complain of persistent
gold stealing, and point out that of the
eight recommendations made by the 1907
Commission only one —that of the appoint-
ment of extra detectives —has been carried
into effect. Even this one was only adopted
after repeated urgent requests by the
Chamber of Mines and after the cos. had
agreed to pay £2OOO a year, or two-thirds
of the cost. Some of the ignored recom-
mendations were important. One was that
treatment plants should be licensed, as in
Maoriland; another, that owners be com-
pelled to keep books showing details of trans-
actions, and that heavy penalties be pre-
scribed for using unregistered plants or for
breaches of the licensing law. The dummy-
lease fraud was also touched on. The
Commissioner showed that a man might
own a worthless lease, but ore alleged to
come from it would often give phenomenal
results. He indicated how this fake could
be stopped, but the recommendation still
remains a dead letter, as does also one sug-
gesting that the law against exporting un-
declared gold be reinforced by providing that
passengers’ luggage be open to search. Mine-
owners are still of the opinion that gaol
without the option is the only real cure
for gold stealing.
“S.X.”: “Oof Bird’s’’ remarks on the
Eraser’s and Central group (B. 28/10/T5)
gave more than due attention to the Maori
Bass, which is only a make-weight in the
scheme. For his snarls at the Fraser’s line
itself there are in answer the opinions of
men who amount to something, as well as the
mine records themselves. Pockety or no, the
line produced £755,350 from 344,77(3 tons,
and the tails gave an average cyanide ex-
traction of Bdwt. many years after crushing
had stopped. Govt. Geologist H. P. Wood-
ward says “the lode is a true fissure, and
there is every probability of continuance of
size and value in depth.” Geologists Smith
and Gibson and State Mining-Engineer
Montgomery testify likewise. Lockhead
(one-time mine-manager of Fraser’s), J. W.
Rogers, Sam Lang, J. O’Neill, F. Rowe and
other solid Yilgarn men have no doubt of the
show’s value when re-opened. Bewick,
Moreing (who had it optioned) couldn’t get
the money after the Bullfinch debacle; so
their failure to do anything with it doesn’t
count.

Victoria United, Ballarat East, is a lively
example of what might have been. It has
turned out £613,5C0 of gold, paid £51,000 in
divs., and is now starving for a little cash to
carry on progressive work at 1300 ft. and
1600 ft. The memory of man will only just
go back to the time when the claim started,
yet the fees raked in by directors have
totalled only £1619. All the rest has gone
in wages, fuel, timber and crushing costs,
stores and tributors’ allowances. The secret
of most of the trouble is that cash wasn’t
available to open up big blocks of stone
ahead, and to put up a battery to belt
through in a few years what it has taken
generations to treat. Now the co. is handling
sdwt. dirt, and barely making ends meet.
Only uncalled capital amounting to £1666 is
available to reach the shoots north on the
Duchess line, and there is little disposition
to call that up while a fight over the wage
question is being waged. Altogether Victoria
United to-day looks more like a loose end
than a solid mining proposition.
* * * *
Too much of Jim McCrorey’s hopefulness
appears to be woven into the Langi Logan
South half-yearly effusion. For one thing,
the mine plans show that chairman 1). Mur-
ray must have shunted on his idea that the
Gathcart Central gutter empties into the
Langi South, as the lead is shown to curve
nicely into the New Langi, as Toole always
said it would. The talk now is more of
Langi South as a position claim, and with
that view of things agreement can be ex-
pressed. What the Langi gets the South
should get, with the added advantage that
it ought to be the. range of any
scour created by the dropping of the Cath-
cart gutter into the big Langi lead. That’s
a lot to concede ; therefore I). Murray and
J. McCrorey cannot snarl if issue is joined,
not with the assertion that shareholders
“will be able to appreciate the great value
of the property,” but with the statement that
“it may reasonably be expected that opera-
tions will, before long, approach a profit-
making basis.” Go along! About all the
plans show is 300 ft. of the lead entered from
the intermediate, and then the gutter looks
like having been crossed. No. 2 rise went
the way of all flesh, and though the gutter
was run into by the No. 3 the ground there
was as wet as a bookmakers’ banquet. True,
beyond that patch of dampness some cut-
ting-up drives around No. 1 rise have _given
161 ox. from 784 fathoms, but the work is too
limited to say "that an output will soon be
possible on a decent scale. The co. has
butted into the gutter to the north-west and
south-east, by drives run off the intermedi-
ate. These will help to isolate a nice slab of
wash. The main reef and south-east branch
drives 1000 ft. south-west will do ditto, but
to drain 1500 ft. of the lead will take a few
calls, unless Bill Toole’s pumping has made
the job light for the South. So far, Langi
South hasn’t been a cheap job. Inclusive of
£5OOO which went to the vendors, £64,032
has gone to get a few hundred pounds’ worth
of gold. Calls aren’t as nearly ended as some
people would like to think. Yet on the pro-
spects the job is worth the cash.
Captain Teddy Miles confides in No. 2
report on his Deebook Dredging claim that
(1) the ground worked was patchy, and
(2) that bores ahead of the dredge show
further patchiness. This behavior of the
wash calls forth a chirrup: “As the manag-
ing director in his scout boring struck none
of these poor patches, it is hoped that a
better average will be maintained in the
future; but the patchy nature of the ground
makes it very difficult to form an estimate
of the probable output.” All of which shows
that the Deebook promoters took a lot of
risks in putting the co. off on the boring
done. As the co. now has two dredges hard
at it, the sooner Captain Miles and General
Palfreyman get the entire area closely bored
the better—unless, of course, they want the
whole thing to be a gamble. Captain Miles
puts the high costs as being very largely
due to drought, but Arthur H. Miles, gen-
eral manager, sets out that clay and depth
are factors that can’t be ignored. With
so much candor by Miles father and son
criticism is disarmed except to the extent
of saying that, putting all the reports
together, Deebook doesn’t look quite the
sweet thing it was once said to be. Its
record to May 31 last was 441,565 cub.
yards dealt with for 2091 tons of black tin,
having a gross value of £19,319. The net
value per cub. yard, after deducting royalty
and smelting costs, was 9.303 d.; all other
costs were 7.056 d., leaving net profit 2.247 d.
per cubic yard. Expenses in Siam ran into
£11,394, of which salaries mopped up £1032.
This is a pretty big' slice; but in that
respect things can’t be normal. Here, for
instance, is an item of £270, loss by robbery
and murder. It isn’t a normal country.
Risks aren't so great in Australia; yet office
costs run to £1597. It needs the explana-
tion that part of this sum represents an
annual payment made to the managing
director as part settlement for the pro-
perty. Bringing everything in, the net
profit was £3913, which wasn’t enough to
pay the dividend of £4500.

JEFFREY’S
SCOTCH LAGER
BREWED IN EDINBURGH
A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, Noveaidek 3. 1935.
My Dear Aiuni.
Professor David, like the line old “sport”
everyone knows him to be. is going to the
Front in the working rig of a mining en-
gineer. He’s as tough and Aviry as a surfing
youngster, and seems to dodge most of the
aches that flesh is heir to. When he Avent
to the Yntaretic he was so thin that Job’s
comforters predicted the Polar breezes Avould
blow him out to sea. Instead, he came
back a plump and pink-cheeked advt. for a
diet of blubber and talloAV. He will shoulder
a pick or a spade at the weary Front AA r ith
the same zeal that kept him busy in a tem-
perature of eternal freeze. And his example
will be a fuse carrying into every mining
field where an “old boy” of the Sydney
Science School is at work.
In a corner devoted to pictures in the
recent Ideal Home show at the Town Hall
there Avere two gems from the brush of the
versatile Minns. Qne was snapped up
straight off. It’s “Sunday in Cornwall.” By
the look of the washing on the lines, a good
Cornishman mixes his hearty prayers for
a good wreck with a masterful soaping of
his duds on the Sabbath. Sid Long’s excur-
sions to St. Ives, Stelling’s impressions of
Egypt, and Tristram’s local paint-pot were
represented on canvas in this same corner. •
The Exhibition authorities have a couple
of bones to pick with the City ditto.
When it was a matter of getting
things ready for the tenant no ham-
mer must fall to break the holy Sab-
bath. When it was a matter of tidying up
and getting things ready for the municipal
landlord, the holiness of the Sabbath didn’t
count, and they could hammer as much as
they liked. So they cheerfully broke the
Sabbath to suit the authorities’ convenience,
though a week before they couldn’t drive a
tack in to suit themselves. The second griev-
ance concerned painters. Having hired the
Town Hall at, a thumping rent the tenants
found that the municipal parents had em-
ployed workmen to paint the roof of the
entrance, and when you looked in to see
I he shoAV you had a preliminary gamble Avith
the paint drops.
The women’s competition in plans of ideal
cots to cost under £2OOO Avas Avon by i
Mosman girl, Winifred Allan. Winifred,
who has a bench in an architect's office,
turned out a compact design for a bungaloAv
that included everything from a billiard-
room to a magpie on the lawn.
A thrifty old dame who steadily collected
samples from all the advertising-stands in
the Exhibition rolled up to the Arts and
Grafters and asked what they had to give
away. This show AA'as a strong feature of
the architects’ outbreak. May Gibbs, Ada
Newman, Madeline King and Molly Bam-
nerger deserve honorable mention for their
Avares. A recent arrival from London, Fred-
erick Tod, showed some wood-carving in the
Gibbons manner. It made a flutter. A
console, with a cherub’s face in the centre,
was so deeply and delicately cut that you
expected the babe’s eyelashes to blink if the
floor shook.
The model bungalow Avas put up for sale
on Saturday afternoon. Auctioneer Little’s
11ow of patter- stirred a cold circle of bidders,
and , the Scandia chalet Avas knocked doAvn
to Mark Foy for £485. It’s likely to go to
Medlow.
One of the lady demonstrators at the
“Home” Exhibition. Miss Bourne, carried
off. tivo first prizes for toothsome edibles.
One of the prize winners had a soft giggle
to herself over the oven every day, when a
sympathetic male from another section tried
to carry her off for an occasional meal. A
notion that she AA 7 as starving in the midst
of plenty, and such audible comments of
spectators as. “Ah, poor thing—she looks as
if she’d seen better days!” kept the lady
cook in a state of dimples that made her
spoil a promising bit of dough iioav and
again.
Melba has commissioned Florence Rod way
to paint her a picture of her old friend
John Lemmone. John, preserved in oil. is
to be Avaiting on the Quay or near by when
the skylark flutters home in March.
Mrs. Tony Hordern has left for Egypt,
where hubby is already working on the
tangled administration of the N.S.W. Red
Cross funds. Mrs. John Toohey, of Wah-
roonga, is off to the same sandy kingdom.
“Shirts in the trenches” Avas the appro-
priate heading of the soft-goods Sargoods’
garden party at Wahroonga the other after-
noon. On' a fete day eA 7 en the most exclu-
si ve York-street drapers fling open their
suburban rose bushes to the vulgar public.
Only, you mustn’t dare to ask them. Arini,
the names of the bridge-players behind the
baronial counters. Especially if you are a
mere pen-woman you mustn’t expect Rip-
pon Lea to “come down” to the manners of.
say. mere Governor’s ladies. You would
almost think Rippon Lea had a skeleton to
hide, wouldn’t you?
Violet Paget is waiting in subdued sus-
pense for further news about Hugh Buckler,
who is dangerously ill, the cable says, and
at Malta. His wife will go to him if he
lives, leaving her engagements here. She had
just returned from M.L.. and was booked
for the lead in “The Man Who Stayed at
Home.”
The Rajah of Pudukota and Mrs. Pudu-
kota, after another look at Sydney, have
gone off again with a Himalaya of Sara-
togas and the family diamonds.
Lady Helen Ferguson, who is keen to chat
to other women, has been giving a tactful
lead to the good-works committee at the
Royal Naval House. The bi-monthly gather-
ing there the other afternoon brought the
usual group of sailors’ wives to meet the
Quality. Her Ex. reminded Mrs. Bluejacket
of the* snare of letting herself down in the
matter of tucker because there wasn’t a
hungry man on the premises. A like warn-
ing as to dress was not so needed. So far
as Australian women are concerned they’re
not apt to get down-at-heel because hubby is
on blue water.
Private Cyril Bacon, youngest son of
squatter Francis Bacon, died in London a
few days ago. He was wounded, but had
got the best of his damages. Then, while he
was recuperating on the Thames, appen-
dicitis did what the enemy’s bullets had
failed in. His mother is on the way to Eng-
land. hoping to see a son waiting on the
shore.
Mrs. Forrest’s book of fairy stories and
verse is to be called “The Green Harper.”
It’s on the linotype for Christmas. Lieut.
Mills, a brother of this Queensland weaver
of many-colored fancies, is in charge of a
fort in Nyassaland. He has been mentioned
in despatches for his success thereabouts.
The fighting, he writes, is intermittent. One
night it’s lions, the next Germans. And the
day after that it’s a game of football.
The Sydney woman, Dr. Isabel Ormiston,
is now in Montenegro. She has started a
hospital in that mountainous patch, after
heroic work in Belgium. The strenuous
Isabel, who looked like a slender little girl
Avith a crown of pretty hair a few years
ago. has been on active service since war-
guns boomed in Flanders. She writes of
a queer trophy the enemy (who is prone to
gh r c away other people’s property) handed
her at Ostend. It’s a Belgian omcer’s
sword.
Grace Watson drops in Avith a word from
an English town re Zeppelins: —
One came to visit us late last night—just at bed-
time. The crash woke me, and I rushed out in a
dressing-gown to have a look at the monster. We
saw it hang low and motionless —a long, broad band
of glazed white light against a faint blue sky. Then
the anti-aircraft guns got to work. Flash —pause —
flash! Ilerr Zep. fled higher and disappeared.
The Australian remarks the mixture of
calmness and curiosity which greets these
uncanny visitors. In her own household
of six women and a man no one turned a
hair. The adjacent streets were immediately
filled witli sightseers. Curious folk walked
miles Avith their necks craned to see if the
sausage-machine tvould come back. “But
there Avas no disorder of any kind, and one
or two Avomen Avlio started to whimper were
sharply reproved by their own sex.”
Youthful-looking Mrs. Arthur OnsloAV. up-
holstered in crisp ivory, blew down from
Menangle this week to order gifts for her
folks at the Front. Her husband, the long-
est and youngest of the clan, is the only man
of the family (five brothers there were
before the war) left to mind the sheep, and,
incidentally, his wife and sister Sybil McAr-
thur Oslow, of Camden Park. And he’s
beating his boots because he can’t go, too.
Colonel Jim. M.P., returned last week for
another load for r.gypt. He managed to
attend an unnecessary Referendum screech
of females with his handsome wife on Fri-
day afternoon, and helped serve Yaralla
strawberries next day. He leaves for Cairo
again very soon.
Mrs. Arthur Onslow’s cousin, the decora-
tive Sheila Chisholm —she that annexed a
live lord —and Mrs. Harry Chisholm, her
mother, are still in Egypt, and report says
their work is of the really valuable sort.
By the heavily society-laden Medina on
Saturday Avent Mrs. Parbury, of Scone, with
daughters Doris and Nancy, hurriedly hast-
ening to hug son Walter before he is well
enough, after a touch of the Turk, to return
to dirt and duty.
The Joynton Smiths’ fete, postponed from
the previous week, made a big bid for popu-
lar favor. On the shores of Coogee, where
the brisk nor’-easter can make crumpled
paper of mere tents, the grounds of Hastings
House were laced with colored lights. In
the soft glimmer of shaded bulbs one saw
the cabbage garden, the Smith cow in its
stall, the lawns trimmed with flowers, and
the performances. The wind tossed the
ringlets on the head of a violinist who
played the fiddle on the back of his nock or
under one knee, but otherwise the breeze
did no damage. Two pretty damsels,
Miss Kenyon and Miss M. Smith, floated
round the* open-air stage in a graceful
effort to turn the tango into a sea-
side minuet. Infant prodigies squeaked or
hopped on one toe, to the joy of other
juveniles in a big audience. But I wish the
performing child wouldn’t take encores with
so little provocation or choose songs with
10 or 32 verses. Allies’ Day takes the col-
lection.
A travelled Roumanian woman, at the
moment in Sydney, makes a spirited com-
ment on the Balkan fat and the fire which
some of it is sizzling in. “It’s eight years,”
she says, “since I left my country, where
politics are intricate. We have the Bear to
nuzzle us on one side and the Austro-Ger-
man boot to tread on our toes on the other.
Bucharest is our capital, and it has become
even more modern than when I saw it. The
older houses are being pulled down to make
way for the latest architecture, and the
beautiful acacia is planted everywhere.
‘Carmen Sylva.’ the Queen Dowager, is popu-
lar, but the late King Carlos was too Ger-
man. He was undoubtedly poisoned for try-
ing to get German munitions through Rou-
mania. His nephew, the present king, is
strongly pro-French.” But you judge from
what the lady of Roumania tells you that
her country is rather a sly old cat. by no
means bound to either France or Britain,
and rather prepared to jump any way when
what she thinks the right time has come—
particularly if the mouse is the beautiful
tract of coveted country that lies in Bess-
arabia.
The wounded British Tommy isn’t the
only one to be talked to and sung at till lie
goes off in a faint. Here —right here in
Sydney—parties of suburban warblers
meander from one soldiers’ rest place _to
another, and do their worst. "Don't mind
me, girls,” one convalescent Kangaroo said
the other day. “Don’t; mind me! I’m so
glad to be home I can stand cmy thing!”
There was considerable Sassiety conster-
nation in the northern end of Maoriland
lately when expensive squatter Collingwood
MacLaren persuaded actress Cissie O'Keeffe
to take the ring of obedience at a Welling-
ton kirk. Contralto Cissie began her very-
juvenile career with the Pollard crowd. Mac-
Laren hails from Hamilton, where he has a
homestead called Aberdeen. There are also
rabbits and racehorses on the estate, the
latter of various colors and achievements.
Before this he was born in Scotland. But
perchance you’ve come to that conclusion
already.
A gift tea party, to swell the Nurses’
Comforts’ fund, is going to meet under the
figtrees at the Garden Theatre. November
4, in the afternoon. And next afternoon
there is to be a patriotic musical matinee
in the Queen Victoria Club.
General Sir Bryan Mahon, in command
of the reinforcements that are rushing to
help gallant Servia, is a cousin of Mrs.
John Barlow. The Sydney woman lost her
only son lately in Gallipoli. But she is
wiping her tears away to see the stitches in
her Red Cross work.
Mutual-friend H. N. Southwell is now
London correspondent for Sydney Evening
News. Awhile ago I fancy he had some
temporary work in the Agent-General’s
office.
As the mouth-organ of the Red Cross,
Hanbury Davies had to say “Thank you”
for a motor-ambulance. The N.S.W. fire
brigades laid this oblation on the altar of
our wounded. One of the signs of the times
is that Australian workmen on the head-
quarters’ staff, where Chief Sparks flashes
a silvery helmet, built the body of the ear
just for love.
The Scotch lass, Rhoda Wager, whose
Art jewellery is getting into our National
Gallery, is at present in Fiji. Her work on
a dull greenish stone, rather like the gleam
of a cat’s eye on a dark night, was pounced
on by the trustees last week. This chryso-
prase pendant caught their eye at the
“Home” show.
Mrs. Heydon’s little effort, “To Our
Heroes.” beat all previous financial records
for verse in N. S. Wales. The Red Cross
has scooped in about £3500 already by the
sale of the booklet, and there are still some
copies to be had at the bookshops. While
Mrs. Heydon, who has a literary kink, deals
out rhythm, hubby retails cold justice in
the Arbitration Court.
The Wentworth Hotel housed a card
party with musical trimmings the other
night. The widow and youngsters of the
late Sergeant-Major Lamont will benefit by'
this. Any extra cash the Edgecliff Rifle
Club can pour into the kiddies’ stockings
will swell the total.
Louise Mack returned from war-lecturing
in Westralia on Friday. She is staying
with her mother at Neutral Bay.
Mrs. Macken-Ward gave a wonderful and
beautiful meal at Paris House last Saturday
evening, by way of a send-off to her two
sons, Bob and Neville, who are bound Lone-
some Pine-ward. The two lads are River-
view College students, and the decorations
were in blue and white, the College colors.
Riverview and the military element per-
vaded the till-we-meet-again function.
Passed through Sydney last Thursday
Esina Inglis Clark, elder daughter of the
late Justice Inglis Clark, of Tasmania.
Miss Clark was in Melbourne for the mar-
riage of her sister Ethel. From the train
she boarded the Niagara. Her objective is
Honolulu, where she will stay some months.
Three of Miss Clark's brothers are in the
lighting lines.
The person least concerned about the re-
port that Major Vernon had been killed was
his wife. Immersed in Red Cross socks she
heard nothing of the bad news till it was
officially contradicted. The Light Horse
warrior, who is a typical long, lean Aus-
tralian with a grip on anything he gets to
do. has fallen ill and been invalided to
England.
Dr. Raymond Green, a son of A.W.. of
the State Children's Department, led Sister
Eleanor Grant to St. Andrew's altar-rail the
other day. The bride was a gold-medallist
nurse at Sydney Hospital. They left by the
Medina to offer their combined help to the
Red Cross in London. The boat carried a
whole flock of Nightingales, many of them
from Maoriland. Most of them were loaded
with roses as the boat drew out from Circu-
lar Quay. Between their posies and those
carried by Cup travellers to Melbourne the
Medina had more garden-stuff aboard than
any ship which has left the port this year.
Old High School girls had their annual
gathering without the bun feast that gener-
ally accompanies the flow of anecdote. They
gave a patriotic fund the cash that the eat-
ables would have cost. A breezy address by
Mrs. Reid concerning purple pyjamas and a
storm in a teaspoon as to whether the
•‘head” was or was not wearing a shocked
expression after the garments had been
mentioned were the crumbs the old girls
mostly chattered over.
Artist Tindall’s eldest daughter, Nessie.
has replied in satisfactory terms to Sydney
Brooks-Lloyd, a wool-buyer. Nessie is
almost as fond of having a smack with a
paintbrush as her daddy.
The war has flung a wet rag on all sorts
of outbreaks. Even Lister Lister’s young
daughter, whose rippling laugh made her the
darling of the comic reciter at every R.A.
Society’s party, has lost her joyous chortle
in the heel of a sock. In consequence the
Students’ Night last week was a stiff and
formal affair with no nonsense about it.
Mrs. Kearney, wife of an Orange solici-
tor. has been spreading her pen in prose and
verse to help the war funds. Her “Men of
Gallipoli” souvenir has put £23 in the burst-
ing Australia Day coffers.
Another batch of masseuses leaves here in
November for the war zone. Amongst the
strenuous ladies is Mrs. Eeddall. a daughter
of Corbett Lawson, of Strathfield. A former
Children’s Hospital nightingale, Miss. Grave,
has fortified her training with the _ same
muscular effort, and goes with the unit.
Overseas travellers are good business for
photographers in these troublous times. Any-
body wishing to go overland through France
must be provided with three photos, one of
which is attached to the passport. Most
people don't hoard their likenesses; so there
is usually a rush and a hurried interview
here with the French Consul, who directs
operations. The Moeraki brought 11 M.L.
private nurses who didn’t know about the
picture passport, and frantic was the "phon-
ing and the wirepulling before the Medina
bore them off.
Jimmy Hazlitt. the brilliant cricketer who
was a master at old King’s School, passed
out last week. He married a daughter of
Major, one of J.C.W.’s trustees and mana-
gers. Hazlitt, senior, was also in the foot-
lights business, and used to be in the front
at the Criterion.
According to a school inarm the kiddie is
such a glutton for work connected with war
funds that it's hard to keep him to the three
R’s. The school ’spector is fixinv a steely
glance on the patriotic infant’s school-
records. and refuses to make any allowance
for his distracted state of mind and finance.
Often the Kid is really busy with his own
private cash accounts when he ought to be
attending to quite impersonal vulgar frac-
tions. His latest achievement has _ been a
cwt. or two of sweets, which he denied him-
self to send to the fighting man.
The 2nd Battalion Comforts Committee
remarks that it has just snared a workroom
at 39 Pitt-street. From 10 to 4 daily some-
one lies in wait there for your contributions.
Still another dodge to get the Allies’ hat
filled. A silver coin party at the Mint.
Visitors are respectfully requested not to
touch the exhibits.
During a lull in highway robbery last
week one had time to contemplate the new
parasols. Their fearsome length takes some
handling in a crowded city. One smart
damsel, after heroic struggles to shade her
face with one of these frilly towers of silk,
found that she was poking the hanging
lamps outside a row of shops. She steal-
thily circumvented her weapon by snapping
it up, and carrying it thereafter as if she
were an armed Lancer.
Yours affectionately.

Women, Warner cor-

tinguished by grace of
carriage and well pro-
portioned figure lines.
Careless corseting sooner or later
plays havoc with once lovely lines.
It therefore behoves every woman
ro give care and attention to the
choosing of her corset. Warner
models can be had in every figure-
style, and at prices that will
appeal, and the satisfactory re-
sults of this corseting at once
convince wearers of Warner
superiority.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, November 1, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Lady Helen did not appear at Flemington
on Derby Day, but his Ex. was there accom-
panied by a new pale-grey belltopper with a
black band, and Governor Stanley had a
brace of Genthelps with him. The dressing
was weird and wonderful. The most ex-
pensive fashionables walked up and down for
inspection, and the suburban women huddled
together on the stand and said, “Let’s sit
here and see how the new short skirts go.”
Only those with pretty feet dared the very
brief garments. Young Mrs. Leonard was
kilted in a black-and-white check ; her boots
were stagey creations of white kid and
patent leather, with heels so high that she
had a list for’ard.
Somebody in an ermine coat with a flare
and a sable, collar walked the lawn with a
length of khaki—and I suspect her of doing
it simply for the color effect. The Fink girl
who married the Rajah wore a flat, wide-
brimmed hat of shining jet. Her other togs
were black. The sister was merely striped
as to the costume, with heaps of white furs.
Mrs. Payne wore brown velvet loaded with
beautifully-marked fox feathers.
Roma Clark had a sporty look and the
new walk. Her clothes were “navy” and
short-cut; her race-glasses were slung well
forward, and an enormous black butterfly
fluttered on her tall hat. The feminine tall
hat, by the way, is only achieved by the
favored customers of the inner millinery
shrines. Mrs. Leslie Stuart chose a rich,
Egyptian sand' color for her outfit, with a
saucy hat tip-tilted over one eye. The
small hats now have to be glued on to keep
at the correct angle.
A smart visiting stranger, who hid blush-
fully under a drooping hat. wore a brilliant
blue dress loaded with black satin panniers
and a bustle. Once the wind caught her
fairly, and her escort had to tow her to
shelter, while the draperies ballooned threat-
eningly. Mrs. Jack Pearson motored out
with Mrs. Scot Sharp from the wilds of
Berwick. Mrs. Knight, from Sydney,
waved grey feathers in a smart black hat
and sailed in company with Mrs. Sternberg.
Mrs. Ilennessy walked sedately in brown,
and during the long calm intervals dis-
cussed Red Crossings with a flock of inter-
ested matrons.
Patrobas, the Derby winner, belongs to a
lady—Mrs. Widdis —and the proud owner
was to the fore in all the bravery of cham-
pagne-colored gown and frothy champagne
feathers while the animal was being-
recorded by the moving-picture men.
Patrobas, of course, wore the pale-blue rib-
bon, beautifully rucked and gathered on to
a white satin lining, on his brown satin
neck. It was a great day for Gippsland.
Mr. Widdis, of Nambrok station, witnessed
the triumph of his wife’s colt, and cheered
for the Jack Millses of Powerseourt, near
Maffra, when Traquette won the Melbourne
Stakes and Ettefred rushed away with the
Maribyrnong Plate.
Mrs. “Glenloth” Peter is down for the
races with khaki in all sorts of shades for
day wear. The evening duds are biscuit
color. She declares that she’d rather be
home knitting or mangling than repeat the
“matching” ordeal for the shoes and stock-
ings. The poor lady has knitted so hard
that she has neuritis in her arm. She got
to the two-hundred-and-twentieth pair of
socks when she broke off to have a little
holiday. So great is her sock enthusiasm
that I’m told she has a Bundy clock and a
factory whistle at home, and the housemaid
fines her 3d. for every minute she is late.
At the Town 11 all the other day the com-
mittee of the But (oh Day Fund said
“Hooray!” to its lion, organiser, Herbert
Tucker, who is going with his wife for a
trip to the U.S.A. In the intervals of weep-
ing, the button-committee handed over an
assortment of bags, brushes, and gold- and
silver-ware. At the same time Miss Cornelius
(assistantetsecretary) received a gold pendant
and chain. They all deserved the presents;
but I don’t want anybody to subscribe to
give me a cake-dish while Bill q,£ Australia is
getting scurvy at Gallipoli, through lack of
an assorted diet. > *
State-Governor Stanley has
for £lOO to a patriotic fund and ffineelled
the usual Cup-time garden party. The
little donation was accompanied by a letter
or sermon to the.; : effect that his Ex. did not
like tp spend nibirey on pleasure in these
dark days. But I don’t believe Governors
do enjoy their own garden parties.
The patriotic dinner at the Savoy menuvred
its way to complete success. The food Bait
induced the Best Fed to gather thickly—
so thickly that? the cafe was packed with
half-guinea feeders, and each mouth meant
five shillings to help build kitchens at Vic-
toria Barracks for the refreshment of de-
parting recruits and invalided veterans.
Music drifted over the bent heads of the
cliewers and fell into the soup. When Wal-
ter Kirby (hidden from view by roses)
tenored an “Are Maria” a lot of people
wept over the victuals. I threw the roast
duck I was eating under the table and burst
into tears.
Several extra hundreds of pounds were
gathered by the impromptu auctioning of
any old thing that came handy. Sam Hor-
dern paid £4O for the Australian flag and
presented it to his hostess, Mrs. Leslie
Stuart. As the flag is usually put up and
recaptured (at heavy cost of gold) the
Stuarts’ black-and-white table became mo-
mentarily the centre of interest. Every man
at the table owned a Cup horse, and gold
would have fallen off them at a challenge.
“Prince” Baillieu bought for guineas and
guineas several yards of lace that Lesley
Madden produced. As the buyer was the
bachelor Baillieu all the matrons sat up
and began to take notice. What does a
bachelor want with lace? Lawyer Leslie
Stuart nodded several times, and found later
that his nods had cost him sheaves of
cheques. Mrs. Colonel Waters, in a frock
which was like a burst of music, had a
valuable Venetian turquoise plate laid at her
feet by the purchaser.
There were men in khaki everywhere;
some of them were just about to depart,
others had just returned with stories to tell.
The gaiety was a sort of flash back to the
days “before the war,” and, of course, every-
body’s conscience was at peace because they
were doing it all for the good cause.
The Arthur Paynes had a big round table
ringed with guests. The Millers and the
Bowes Kellys hostessed two other hollow
designs from Euclid. That Knight who
married a Falkiner (no, this isn’t the start
of a fairy tale) w T as in charge of yet
another champagne spread, and Mrs. Dal-
rymple, Mrs. Norman Falkiner and Mrs.
D’Ebro captained separate teams. E. J.
Watts, who owns Mountain Knight, was
with the Arthur Paynes. The horse wasn’t
invited. Leslie Macdonald, who had sold
Baverstock to the Baillieux, was there with
his magnificent wife clad in silver and blue
brocade below the waist and five inches of
untearable tulle over her shoulders. Her
gloves reached her shoulders. Miss
Reynolds, the smart, fair sister of Mrs.
Clive Leonard, contrived another dress-
spasm. You wouldn’t believe me if I told
you what it was. Anyhow, I don’t know ;
but a waiter is said to have fainted. Mrs.
Leslie Stuart, in black, with a huge white
fluffy ruff, had her thick fair hair soaped
back in the manner of the ruff-time queens.
The smooth-haired lady was in charge of
the king table. She presented a silken
Australian flag (her own make) to the best
decorated table. Mrs. George Fairbairn was
the winner. She, my dear, wore pearls and
ivory brocade. Her table was decked with
roses trellised on to gold net and supported
by gold candelabra.
Instead of the usual ball the
ters had a Night in Egypt at the St. Kilda
Town Hall for patriotic purposes. Every
guest was requested to bring a cushion for
a wounded soldier. The result was that one
end of the barn was piled with comfy
cushions in every imaginable color. The
decorations were Egyptian, and ranged from
stiff Pharaoh figures to weird symbols like
Chinese washing bills. The dressing was
a medley; you put on or left off just what
you liked—-within reasonable limits. The
Staugliton widow, less severe than usual,
presented a smile with the prizes. Mrs.
Astley veiled herself so perfectly as an
Egyptian woman that a prize was bestowed
-upon her. The late Tommy Bent’s grand-
daughter as a Salome was another winner.
The youngster also did a special dance in the
Maud Allan'manner.
George Doery, a well-known “Lane”
trader, whom this country has assisted to
wealth by re-importing its own wool, is try-
ing to put something on the other side of
the account; he is handing over the Doery
home at Balwyn to the Red Cross for the
use of soldier-invalids. The Red Cross
branch at Camberwell, which is to provide
the running exes., has already had friendly
attentions from Mrs. Doery, and this offer of
picturesquely-placed Ilighton is in the nature
of a crowning effort.
Enter Adelaide with her typewriter:—
Saturday was chiefly remarkable for the fact that
it was the day of a garden fair in aid of a mere local
charity. E. T. Smith had lent his grounds to the
Queen’s Home, and in due course the usual things
were sold, and a concert occurred harmlessly in the
ball-room. The public (God bless it!) rolled up
in force, and Lady Galway, who brought Miss
Macaulay with her, came along in time to declare
the riot started. On the same afternoon the Gawler
Races transpired at Victoria Park instead of on
the club’s own course, as the military are still in
possession of the latter. . . ' (
On Saturday evening there was the Serena concert
at the Town Hall. The Galways listened, with Miss
d’Erlanger, Miss Macaulay and the Legh -Winsers.
The Douglas Mawsons, the Walter Bagots, the Waites,
the Seymour Hawkers, Miss Jean Stirling and others
also drank with their ears. Roy Mellish, William
Silver and Harold Parsons lent a hand, and Eugene
Alderman was responsible for the orchestra. It
didn’t disgrace him.
The Adelaide Polo Club has decided to deflate
itself for this summer and play no games. Carew
Rejnell, who was killed at the Dardanelles, was one
of the Club’s best players and most popular members.
“Cattle King’’ Kidman has received news of the
death of nephew George while travelling with a
mob of 17,000 sheep from Winton to Adelaide. He
contracted a chill which developed to pneumonia,
and, as doctors are rare on stock routes, the chances
are that very little could be done for him. He
was once manager of Tinapagee station.
News has come through that Eric Aldridge has
been wounded at the Dardanelles. He is an old
St. Peter’s boy, who gave up a good Imperial Service
position at Fiji to enlist. A. A. Jacobs, a member
of the Register staff, has also been damaged.
Lady Galway, who put in the middle of the week at
Anlaby as the guest of the H. 11. Duttons, cleverly
opened a fete in what is one of the best gardens of
the State, in aid of the Red Cross Funds. While
this wonder was being performed, his Ex. was feeding
and speeding the Governor of W.A. on his passage
through our State. What a lot the Truly Great
must eat!
Manager Borrowman, of the Trustees and
Executors Co., is welcoming liis soldier son
back from the trenches. Having lost an
arm for Australia young Borrowman will
not be able to trench again.
Lesley Madden, who has had a wide ex-
perience in “starting something,” made one
of her rare appearances as a public speaker
the other day. It was at an Austral Salon
meeting, held to discuss the question of an
Edith Cavell memorial, and the pink, plump,
pleasant Lesley’s remarks were the most con-
spicuously common-sensible of all heard
there. On Mrs. F. G. Hughes making the
flamboyant suggestion of “a bronze statue
outside the Melbourne Hospital,” Lesley
said boldly that she didn’t think a memorial
of that kind was necessary or advisable, and
suggested instead an extra effort for the
pinched funds of the hospital itself. In the
end the matter was sent up for discussion
on a larger, Town Hall scale. As for the
bronze statue nothing more has been heard
of it.
A girl in London tells me that the city
holds so many wounded Tommy Kangaroos
that the A.N.A. has opened an Anzac buffet
next to the Commonwealth Office, where Tom
can rest in a cosy lounge, or have light re-
freshments from the hand of the Australian
girl. He is not asked to pay, but is told it’s
the least we can do for him, bless his heart!
Four hundred looked in the first week, and
the number is swiftly growing, so that larger
premises will soon he wanted.
Dolores was invited to open the Rose
Show, and managed to do so in speech,
though she afterwards confessed she would
rather have sung the gate ajar. It seems to me
that the committee missed a big chance.
Next year some special incantations should
be written and set to music. As it was, the
band played Italian, French and English
anthems, and a fearfully cultured Rose man-
darin walked Dolores and her grey feathered
hat round the hall and showed her the latest
creations in the queen of blossoms. Mrs.
Robert Reid walked with the star-lady and
Miss Vairdot in fine feathers. She has been
proudly hostessing the pair for a week or
tw T o.
Phil Smith in “The Dancing Mistress”
was always sure of a gallery roar when he
announced his Cup fancy, William the Talker
out of France by Christmas. But Berlin
is probably spilling good lager over equally
thin jokes.
There was a great gathering of the clans
on Saturday night at the Princess’s for “A
Scrape o’ th’ Pen.” The Alawa Buchanans
were prominent in the front circle, the lady
shaking large diamond raindrops from her
ears, and there were more blazing diamonds
in her hair. Mrs. “Glenloth” Peter, a lovely
vision in amber togs, was in the stalls with
a party. She is from Edinboro’, ye ken, and
20 Australian years have not dulled the edge
of her accent. The Munro-Fergusons saved
themselves for another evening; but there
was quite enough Scotch to go on with.
Married at high noon last Wednesday
(October 27), Ethel, youngest daughter of
the late Justice Inglis Clark, of the Tas;
manian Bench. The other party to the suit
is A. G. Sydney Woodward, of the Expedi-
tionary forces. Dr. Eben Gould,, of Mal-
vern, gave the young reddishly-golden bride
over to the soldier boy. And presently the
latter will leave his wife flatting (at pic-
turesque old Riversdale House, near St.
Ivilda), and go where his King and country
need him.
Gladys Weatherly, youngest of the Brigh-
ton heiresses, after looking round the U.S.,
had a horrible time crossing the Atlantic.
Arrived at last, she fell into an English pri-
vate hospital for repairs to her nerves. Jus-
tice Hood’s daughter, who was her cabin
mate, managed without the rest cure. How-
ever, Gladys soon recovered, and so dazzled
a Scotch naval engineer that he proposed.
(To be continued.)
From “Rosna,” in London :—-
Latest Australians to go to the Continent as min-
istering angels include two pretty Chomley girls,
daughters of the editor of the British Australasian.
They are off to Nice to help in a hospital for Belgian
wounded, and except for one other damsel will be
the only Britishers in the institution. It is a glori-
ous place, situated on a promontory and looking over
the sea on three sides. It is part of the estate of
Albert of Belgium, and has a garden containing
nearly every flower that blows. The Australian girls
speak French fluently and are jolly and capable
as only their country-women can be, I'm beginning
to think.
Mr. and Mrs. Pudukota are packing up at
Menzies’. After streaking to the TJ.S. with
Mamma Fink and sister Ida, and then streak-
ing back again, they prepared for the jump
to India by the Medina. Mamma goes along
to beat off with her umbrella her son-in-
law’s smudgy subjects when, overcome by
loyal ecstasy, they welcome the happy couple
to the capital. The Rajah merely intends to
take a few 11-gun salutes before lighting out
for Paris, where he intends to become a
Frenchman by the naturalisation process.
Sister Ida (who stays on here for a while)
will later be welcomed to the city the Ger-
mans didn’t take by Mamma, the Rajah and
the Also Ran-ee.
The Leonard Flannagans' and the Hart-
ridges, of Malvern, are now related, Doris
(the only Flannagan girl) and Keith Hart-
ridge having just been married in England.
The ’groom is a surgeon in France these
days, but took the Channel trip last week in
time to dash up to the altar.
Mrs. “Nambrok” Widdis, owner of the
Derby winner Patrobas, travelled up _ to
town on the eve of the race from the wilds
of Gippsland with Mrs. Jack Mills, another
keen sportswoman. During the journey
they knitted like machines. Mrs. Mills is
an all-wool enthusiast, and when a fellow-
traveller excused herself by saying she had
forgotten to bring her chopsticks along, Mrs.
Mills rose from her seat and fished out, from
her dressing-bag on the rack, a knitting out-
fit. The female shirker, on being shown this
awful trick, shrieked loudly and threw her-
self out the window. Anyhow, that’s what
would have happened if I were writing a
novel. ;
The Panama Exposition films were run off
at a special private view on Friday. Sedate
and important society squaws moaned their
delight at seeing a straight-out film “without
any of those vulgah chasing pictures” in
which common working-men laden with
baskets of whitewash fall over beauti-
fully-dressed people. Also, it did their
eyes good to see “the people one
KNOWS, dear.” There was, for in-
stance, deah Richard Nevill, in full
military costume, silently presenting some
special Cup to noiseless people on behalf of
King George V. Then there was Alfred
Deakin, exquisitely groomed and soundlessly
affable, walking through everything and
round everything, and being as nice as pie to
everybody.
“Oh!” squeaked an unmarried cat the
other day, after running into a beauty
matron just back from N. S. Wales, “you
have got fat. I hope it’s not middle-age
spread!” “Don’t care if it is!” responded
Fatty, icily surveying the spare silhouette of
her enemy-friend. “I’d prefer that to
middle-age shrink.” I suppose diplomatic
relations will be resumed some time.
A suburban chemist has a stepson at the
war in Europe—fighting on the wrong side.
Some years ago he married a stout, round,
smiling, German widow with a young son.
The latter was in Germany when the fat
jumped into the fire, and the German war
machine claimed him. The mother still
dwells amongst us, but her smile is only
intermittent; while hubby is divided between
British-Australian patriotism and wrath at
the customers who drop in to ask the time
and jest about young Wienwurst. By the
way, somebody lately quoted the heir-
apparent of a somewhat-mixed itiuropean
royal family as saying: “When Germany
wins, papa cries. When we win, mamma
cries.”
Somebody tells me that a man (name
unknown) approaches on important busi-
ness. He comes from Paris to look for the
Perfect Arm and Wrist. I don’t know what
your intentions are, dear, but I do no more
ploughing or whitewashing till he has made
his choice.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUTSIDE the Heads, Night cometh,
scarce affrighted
By that far-sweeping beam whose
scimitars
Gash her black mantle till her beauty’s
blighted—-
Within the gates, the channelled ways are
lighted
By red and green and white and yellow
stars;
Here no tired ship need fear to be benighted,
Nor dread such terrors as the coastwise bars.
A lighted gondola of bright-eyed pleasure,
A swift, tail-funnelled ferry, swims between
Low-sweeping hills, which have their starry
measure
Of jewelled lights, that are as heaven’s
treasure,
Robbed by a lover to bedeck his queen.
And, over all, in purple that was-azure,
The stars remaining watch the quiet scene.
As on the ferry goes, on blackness riding,
From many a bay between the lighted hills
More ferries come, like crystal caskets glid-
ing
From leafy bowers, where they have lain in
hiding
All day, and heard the bush-bird’s tuneful
triljs.
And all sweep on, as though one hand were
guiding
To where rich radiance all the distance fills.
A starry argosy, fair tribute taking
To a fair queen of beauty undenied,
They skim the water. As it shivers, break
ing,
At their hot haste, their quivering lights are
shaking
A golden dust upon the night-black tide,
Ere it slips back to slumber, from this
waking,
To dream of Death and hulls that slowly
glide.
Within the gates the channel lights all
primly
Twinkle and wink above a placid tide.
The hills are lighted here; and there show
dimly
Where beacon-lights stand righteously' and
trimly,
Their self-complacence cloaking priggish
pride.
Outside the gates the Night strains land-
ward grimly.
And stares, with lightless eyes, at what's
inside.

The Barrackers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HR EE weeks after the day upon
which they first became acquainted
a juvenile humorist placed, midway
between the backs of their seats in the
Suttor Stand, a card: “Engaged.” It was
the sort of humor that appeals to a crowd;
and it lost nothing because the couple never
became aware of it. The incident merely
serves to show that, to the popular eye,
their progress was rapid.
They had met first in the same stand—
pretty well the same spot. The colors they
sported were a bond of sympathy between
them; but they barracked together without
noticing one another particularly, until,
when the Eastern Glebes had carried the
ball up to the South Balmains’ line, and to
cap the movement it only wanted one of
those crafty movements which had won
Paddy Smith his reputation, the young man
rose and howled for the hero.
“Paddy! Paddy! Paddy!” he entreated.
“Show 'em what you’re made of, pal! Oh,
you beauty! Go it, you treat! O-o-oh!
hard luck!”
He was just about to retake his seat: when
the infamous conduct of the referee in
awarding a penalty against the Eastern
Glebes roused him once more.
“Yah! Get a guernsey!” he yelled, dis-
gustedly.
“Excuse me,” said the young woman,
"but which is Paddy Smith?”
“Paddy? Why, that’s him, number 3;
the one with the splash of mud so as you
can’t see the number. See, he's got a bit of
a limp ; that fall must have hurt him a bit.
But he’ll be on the spot when he’s wanted,
Paddy will —my word for that!”
“Do you know him?” asked the girl.
“Know him? I should say I do! I know'
him like me own brother.”
Obviously he realised that he deserved
admiration, and he got it. The friend of
the chief hero of the Eastern Glebes was
worthy of honor, even if, as it afterwards
transpired, tne friendship depended on only
one casual meeting. He was given, on the
spot, a standing; and, the ice being broken,
he enlightened the young woman on the
niceties of the game and the vague suspi-
cions current about the financial induce-
ments which explained the partiality of the
referee. As sundry South Balmain bar-
rackers also expressed vague suspicions
about the reason for the referee’s undoubted
partiality in another direction, matters were
evened on that score.
It was only natural that at the next
match played by the Eastern Glebes he
should look for the girl, and, seeing her,
renew the acquaintance. On this occasion,
between the times when it was imperative
that every energy should be centred on the
important business of barracking, the con-
versation became personal. He was Harry
Sinclair, clerk in the wholesale softgoods
establishment of- Flugg and Fidgett; she,
he learnt, was Miss Florrie Walker, expert
machinist in the factory of Illphit and
Storrblaus, clothing manufacturers; and.
as it transpired that the serious business of
both their lives was to follow the career of
the Eastern Glebes, Saturday by Saturday,
it was tacitly arranged between them
that they should share the glory of victory
or the humiliation of defeat together.
The arrangement worked excellently; the
enthusiasm of a mutual barrack was an
unfailing bond. But, although exceedingly
friendly, they progressed no further. Cer-
tainly they went to a picture-show or so
together, and met on Sundays in the Botani-
cal Gardens ; but their conversation on these
occasions was mostly about the past vic-
tories of their team and its prospects.
Miss Walker had a fine independence of her
own —that new independence of the work-
ing girl who is able to support herself and
get what she wants without desiring the
generosity of any male companion; and
when Harry—of course he was simply
THE IMMODESTY OF IT.
C HAMBERMAID: “Mr. Siggers, will you be catching the early train?”
MR. SIGGERS: “A-ah! Go away, immodest person! I am partially undressed —do not,
speak to me!”
Harry—wanted to “shout,” she insisted on
paying her own way everywhere. That
was no doubt equitable—because the wage
that an expert machinist can earn exceeds
by a great deal the likely salary of an aver-
age clerk; but it placed them on a footing
which appeared to interfere with the growth
of tenderness.
When the close of the football season left
a blank in their lives they endeavored to
fill it by excursions to various places, and
thus they reached a new arrangement. Harry
paid the expenses; but, to do her part,
Florrie stowed away in the Savings Bank
an amount similar to what she *would have
expended had she been paying for herself,
and it was understood that it was a mutual
account. By this time they knew that some
day they were to be married, though it
would have been difficult for either to
explain how and when the understanding
was reached. They had just drifted into it.
The opening of the football season again
saw them back in the ranks of the bar-
rackers. But new interests had arisen. The
Whr claimed a lot of the interest that could
be spared from the pursuit of football; and
it was obvious that, with Florrie, it claimed
an increasing share of interest. There were
demands for men; the able-bodied and un-
encumbered were being called upon; and
somehow Florrie’s interest in football did
not seem able to sustain itself. At times it
positively flagged.
“The Eastern Glebes,” she said suddenly
one day, “haven’t sent nearly as many men
to the Front as some of the other teams.
Why doesn’t Paddy Smith go?”
“What? And us lose the chance of get-
ting the premiership?” cried Harry incredu-
lously.
“ 'S all very well,” retorted Florrie. “but
there’s better things than football. South
Balmains have lost pretty wejl half their
team, yet they’re not doing badly. And some
of their best men have gone.”
“They'll be right out of it,” said Harry,
decisively.
“I shouldn’t mind seeing them win," said
Florrie. “They deserve it.”
“Well, if they did win, it would be the
chaps that didn’t go to the war that did the
winning,” said Harry logically ; and then a
spurt of play brought him to his feet, howl-
ing vigorously.
Florrie’s interest in the war made him
uncomfortable. He had an interest in it
himself; immediately he had seen the foot-
ball results in the late Saturday papers he
always turned to see if there was anything
fresh about the war. But Florrie’s interest
seemed illogical. She was inclined to favor
the teams whose men had responded to the
recruiting call, forgetting that she was
really favoring the men who had not gone,
giving them the credit of the real patriots,
lie had an uneasy feeling that a girl cap-
able of such unreason might even have an
idea that he should go.
The next week Florrie had a shock for
him.
"I’m not coming to see Easts next week,”
she said.
“What’s wrong?” he asked.
“I’m going to the South Balmain and
Central Suburbs match,” she said.
“Oh, are you?” he answered, with assumed
indifference. “Barracking for South Bal-
mains, I suppose/”
“Thatls so,” she saiw, shortly. “Souths
are my team for the future. I like a team
that’s got the right spirit.”
“You can barrack for whom you like, of
course,” he said, with some heat in his
voice. “But there are other things between
us, you know. There were arrangements.”
“If you’re thinking of the banking
account,” she said, stiffly, “I’ll draw the
money, and you can have your half when
you like.”
He quite forgot to howl gleefully as
Paddy Smith collared the ball, and, dodging
skilfully, groundeu in the corner. He was
disturbed to his soul.
“I suppose vou think / ought to do some-
thing?” he burst out, suddenly.
“You ought to know what you ought to
do,” she answered cryptically.
After they had parted he argued the posi-
tion with himself, and arrived at the uncom-
fortable feeling that the girl was right. He
felt more about the breach between them
than he had cared to show; and for a whole
week he was full of unjoyful thoughts.
Liberty and civilisation were calling for
soldiers, and the men of the Eastern Glebes,
like many others, had not responded as they
should. What ought he to do? All the
week he discussed that point within him-
self, until he reached his conclusion.
On the following Saturday, instead of
taking his way to the Eastern Glebes’
match, he was waiting betimes at the
entrance gates to the ground where the
South Balmain match was to be played;
and his wait was rewarded, finally, by the
appearance of Florrie, the colors of her new
team pinned to her blouse. lie shouldered
his way towards her.
“Thought I’d catch you,” he said, ‘so I
dropped the other match. I wanted to say
something to von.”
“It’s no good trying to get me to go back
to the Easts,” said the girl. “There’s more
men in the Souths, an’ they don’t shirk
going to the war when they’re wanted.
That’s where they ought to be —the war.”
“I’ve been thinking over things;” said
Harry, “and it seems to me you’re right.”
“Of course I’m right!”
“Yes; I’ve thought over the matter all the
week, and I’ve come to my decision.”
He spoke portentously. A man in khaki,
standing near, turned curiously.
“Yes,” pursued Harry. “I’ve been think-
ing over what you said about the South
Balmains having the most men at the war.
It seems to me that there’s only one thing
for me to do ; only one thing for any man
to do— l’m going to barrack for South
Balmains !”
With an air of glorious vindication he
drew the colors from his pocket and fixed
them to his coat.
“I thought you would,” said Florrie,
gladly. “Come on, we’ll get in.”
HAMER.
Getting to Sleep.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was 11.1.1 when I went to bed in a
little room off the bar parlor. There
were only four men left in the pub, and
I hoped they would soon clear out. At any
rate closing time was near. Two of the
men went away shortly after I turned in:
but the other two stayed, and arranged to
stop all night.
“Well, we’ll have another drink,” said one.
“Right you are!” They had it.
“I’m blest if you ain’t drunk!” said the
first man.
“No, I ain’t! I ain’t ’smueh shickered as
you are!”
“I ain’t shickered ’loll! I can s-say
Wooll-ermloo!”
“Anybody can say Mooler-moolo!”
“Well, you never said it then!”
“Yesh, I did —-I said it as good as you.
anyway!”
“Well, it’s no use arguin’. I know way
t’ settle the matter.”
"Whash that?”
“Can you put a cork in a bottle?”
“ Course I can! Where’s the cork?”
They adjourned to the bar, and 1 turned
wearily over. The clock struck 12 with
slow, lingering strokes.
Presently they came back into the parlor
and learnedly discussed the question of re-
placing corks. Finally they agreed that the
operation was far more difficult than it
appeared.
“D’yer know, Bill, I’ve seen teetotallers
who couldn’t do it!” (This with dreadful
solemnity.)
“Tha’s ri’!”
At 12.30 one of them remarked that it
must be bedtime.
“Yesh, an’ I’ve got to get up early.”
“Well, you can wake me. I’ve got ter get
up early, too.”
“What time do you want t’ get up?”
“What time are you goin’ t’ get up?”
“< >h, ’bout half-past live.”
“ Half-past five?”
"Yesh, that’s early, isn’t it?”
“Early! I should thing so! You won’t
get up at half-past five.”
“Yesh, I will! Betcher I will! I could
get up at half-past four if I wanted to. I’m
used to gettin’ up, I am. I don’t lie in bed
till the sun scorches me whiskers off!”
“Neither do I! But I reckon that seven is
early enough for any man!”
“Well, I’ll be half-way to Ararat be then !”
“You’re terrible smart, you are!”
The clock struck two.
“Thash one o’clock!”
“No! Ish three!”
“Three be d —d! They’ve just shut the
pub!”
“Well, we’ll go an’ look.”
I lit my candle and got a book.
They disappeared noisily and returned,
with a bottle of beer they had discovered
somewhere.
“We’ll finish this bottle and go to bed.”
“All ri’!”
Half-past two struck../.
“Oh well, if we mm’! Come on!”
I heard a husky “Goo’ ni’!”
The clock struck three.

YOUR Guarantee.
THE difference between a high-grade bicycle and its cheap
and shoddy imitation is very apparent on the road, but in
the showroom it is not so easily detected by the intending
purchaser. However, there’s always one safe course to take ; in
selecting your new bicycle see that it carries the B.S.A. name
and trade marks. They are a guarantee of highest quality
material, workmanship and finish. Bicycles built of B.S.A. Fittings
are known the world over as the “ Perfect in Every Part” bicycles,
and you can rely on the B.S.A. Bicycle you purchase being of
the same high quality which made the B.S.A. great reputation.
FITTINGS
BUILD THE PERFECT
BICYCLE
When choosing a new bicycle it is not sufficient to base
your opinion on surface finish alone. The shoddy bicycle
relies solely on outward appearance, but the real test of
value comes in actual service, and this is where a bicycle
built of B.S.A. Fittings reveals its high quality. In its
construction nothing is omitted which will increase com-
fort, speed and durability. Only selected material and
skilled workmanship of the highest standard are admitted,
and every part is guaranteed interchangeable. A B.S.A.
is always a sound investment and has over a quarter of
a century’s reputation behind it.

AT THE CUP.
THE ONE: “How I would like to preach to these people!”
THE OTHER: “And how I would like to take up the collection!"
“Long Bill”: There is a big lake a few
miles from Charters Towers (N.Q.), about five miles
by a mile, and about 4ft. to 10ft. deep. It has no
connection with the sea. In the drought of 1902
it was as dry as a blue-ribbon meeting;, and all the
eels on the ground floor were eaten by the pigs.
Again this lake dried up a few months ago, and
there were just as many eels as on the previous
occasion. Now, if they did not breed there, how did
they get there ?
“F.11.R.”: I've cooked for him till I’m
sick of the name or the smell of a shearer, so I
know what's wrong. It is want of the right kind
of exercise that affects the barber. He eats a good
breakfast, and then does riot move more than five
yards from the one spot till dinner-time. He is
cramped over foul-smelling, daggy, and often fly-
blown sheep with all his top weight on his stomach.
Hence indigestion and constipation. Then he doses
himself with salts that purge him, and nature throws
up the sponge until shearing is over. But if you
ask the shearer what is to blame he’ll say it’s the
crimson cook.
* * * *
“W.C.M.” : "Billy Bunger” (B. 30/9/T3)
wants the address of posts to beat gidya. My
money goes on belah. It splits well, and will lie
on the ground for years without rotting. Exposure
to the air hardens the outside like iron, and makes
the wood ruinous to the bits when boring has to be
done. The best long-distance cursing record ever
put up was when a mate and myself had to bore
three and a half miles of belah posts for £1 a week
and tucker. The boss came in second over the num-
ber of bits we used. Out on the Lachlan 1 know
of at least one 40-year-old fence as sound as the
one we put up five years ago.
“Billy T.” : There were two of them. They
were down from the country, and were looking in
a very dazed sort of way on the traffic, trying to
recollect what things were. Presently one of them,
feeling in his pocket, discovered a little cardboard
box. He regarded it with interest, he inspected it
with wonder. Opening it he discovered it con-
tained small, perforated discs of a substance resem-
bling court plaster. He took one of them, subjected
it to minute inspection, and tried to think. Twice
he was on the point of conferring with his friend,
but forgot before communication could be estab-
lished. Presently something like a light came to
him. He opened his mouth, and carefully glued the
disc to one of his teeth. Here the friend inter-
vened. “Gerrout,” he said. “It ain't toothache'
you've got— it’s corns!’’
* * * *
“De Oriel”: Mention by “Devilfish” (B.
30/9/T5) of Underwood, Tasmania’s snake king of
the bad old days, recalls “Professor” Davis, who
was publicly and fatally bitten by one of his pet
reptiles in the Midlands (Tas.) 15 years ago. Davis
was a. quaint person, with long, flowing hair, a
squeaky, wooden leg, and a peculiar falsetto voice.
He practised snake-charming in conjunction with
palmistry, and while exhibiting the former gilt
allowed himself to be bitten before an admiring-
audience. On his last appearance the antidote
proved to have been mislaid, much to the regret of
those who had paid for admission, lie passed in
his alley in the midst of the entertainment.
“T.H.M.”: In July, 1914, oil Fowler’s
Bay jetty (S. Aus.), a whopping shark put up a
hair-raising argument with a party of local inhabi-
tar.ts. He cocked his tail only after 00 rifle-balls
liad been injected into him. The tape said he was
25ft. long, 15ft. around the girth, and he weighed
30ewt. At Adelaide Museum expert White diag-
nosed him as Selache matimus, more commonlv
called basking shark, a species which sometimes
reaches 40ft. in length.
BUSHIE ( seeing the window empty): "What d'ye sell here, Mister?"
SMARTIE: “Oh, fools!"
BUSHIE: "W ell, you ain't doin’ a had trade. Idee you only got one left."
“J.G.” : Re the fading away of the side-
saddle (B. 30/9/’IG). This cumbersome piece oi'
harness, as well as being dangerous to riders, was
a. source of much suffering to horses. The hacks
soon developed sore backs or bellies, or both. Not
one woman rider in a thousand could distribute her
weight fairly on both sides of the horse
as a man does. With the bulk of her
weight on the near side of. the nag’s back-
bone, the girths had to be buckled tightly to prevent
the saddle from turning over and spilling its con-
tents, which it often did in spite of all precau-
tions. It was the bike that, settled the side-saddle.
When woman got comfortably into her machine-
saddle like her brother and the howls of Ma Grundy
had subsided, the sex made up its mind that bro-
ther’s horse-saddle was also good enough to go on
with.
* * * *
“Clancy”: There is a peculiar breed of
ant in the Northern Territory. It builds nests in
leafy trees, bending live and dead leaves together
into an oval shape and then binding them with a
webby material into a waterproof antarium. When
the tree is shaken, or an empire-builder attacks it
with an axe, the ants at once mobilise, and falling
down the enemy’s neck repulse him with great
profanity. They are about the size of an ordinary-
meat ant, with a green chassis and a yellow limou-
sine, and though they bite with great enthusiasm
they are not venomous. As they favor big leaves
for building their nests it was once a source of
wonder to me how they bent the vegetation into the
desired positions. I have spent hours investigating
(I was a distractingly busy N.T. Government official
at the time), and to see a row of the insects hang-
ing on by their forepaws to the edge of a leaf while
others waited below with a supply of web to bind
it down was well worth the waste of public money.
“Tiaki”: The doctor received an urgent
call to Waipuna’s whare where (so the old kuia
declared) “he got te werry pad headache in his
puku ’ (stomach). Squills, dressed in approved
cross-country style, got round to the indicated pa.
“E wahine, you know te place where Waipuna live?”
he asked. “Waipuna, Waipuna? Oh, he ko Nvay
town to Auckran’ yistiddy.” Some mistake, thought
Squills. Again the question to a young schoolboy.
“Oh, yesli. Tat Waipuna he gone town to Wellen'-
t’n ’pout two, free tay now. He gone see ’pout his
rand.” An inquiry from an innocent-looking damsel
brought the information that, “Oh, he peen gone
’way Taumarunui ’pout free week now.” A clerical-
looking- individual opined that “he town Napier dish
time now. He koin’ a-stop fere. He newa cornin’
pack fis prace again.” “Well, I’m damned,” said
the puzzled med. “I’m the doctor, and the Maori
begged me to come round”- “Oh,” said every-
body in chorus, “we fink you te proomin’ pairilf,
an’ you kot te shummons for Waipuna. He in
fere, an’ lie peen waitin' rike Hell for you.”
“Kodak'’: A small boy of my acquaintance
has informed me that he knows how to make n
noise like a bunyip. lie says it is done with two
pieces of board which are holed in some curious
way and then whirled round the head. I did not
make any further inquiries, as f do not want to
make a noise like a bunyip; but if any elderly
Abo-liar is in need of the information I can supply
him with the address of the small boy, who is just
bursting with the splendid secret and willing to givt
it away to anybody.
THE BLACK AND WHITE FREE-
LANCER IN TO BEET.
“Zamia”: “Alamon” (B. 28/9/T5l
apparently is not aware that there are two species
of the ti-tree in the North —one- is found on the
banks of creeks and the other grows at the foot
of ridges where the ground is boggy. This latter
species is the best I know for making a fence
through swampy country. The other, except for its
bark, which is second to the box-tree for covering
houses, is useless, as the timber soon gets full of
borers.

PANCAKE FLIPPIN!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bob Curley is a single sport
Who’s quite a nark with jumpin' nags—
At huntin’ sprints, both long an’ short,
A lot o’ welcome gilt he bags.
But Robert’s pride is in his plan
Of flippin’ pancakes in the pan.
Now, Robert has a neighbor who
Delights to tease the huntin’ man
About his deeds of derring-do
At turnin’ pancakes in the pan.
He laughs at Robert’s knack of wrist
By which he gives the pan a twist.
One day when Bob was cookin’ grub
The neighbor brought a pal who’d come
From Gippsland, an’ (here lies the rub)
At pancakes he was reckoned some!
He’d knock out Robert’s cherished plan
Of flippin’ cookies in the pan!
The twain decided there an’ then
To stake a tenner as to who
Could deftliest flip a pancake when
To brown the other side was due.
Of rules there wasn’t really much—
The principal was not to touch.
Bob cooked his cake an’ cooked it well,
He turned it with a clever flip,
An’ slick back in the pan it fell
What time the stranger curled his lip !
Bob started of his knack to brag
Thinkin’ the tenner in his bag!
The stranger took the batter, an’
In proper fashion spread it out—
This way, an’ that, lie tipped the pan ;
No doubt he knew his way about;
Then asked the watchers to stand clear—
lie hadn’t practised for a year!
’Twus then Bob’s rival flipped to score.
llis pancake up the chimney flew,
An’ then it landed, through the door,
Back in the pan where it was due!
That night, Bob’s hard-earned tenner went
At Hogan’s pub in merriment!

monotony of set, unvarying records is gone.

Beauty Doctor Tells Secret.
Beauty Doctor Gives Simple Recipe to
Darken Grey Hair and Promote Its
Growth.
Miss Alice Whitney, a well-known beauty
doctor, recently gave out the following-
statement : “Anyone can prepare a simple
mixture at home, at very little cost, that
will darken grey hair, promote its growth
and make it soft and glossy. To a half-pint
of water add loz. of bay rum, a small box
of Orlex Compound and Joz. of glycerine.
These ingredients can be bought at any
chemist’s at very little cost. Apply to the
hair twice a week until the desired shade is
obtained. This will make a grey-haired per-
son look 20 years'younger. It is.also fine
to promote the growth of the hair, relieve
itching and scalp disease, and is excellent
for dandruff and falling hair.” [G

“S. S. Severn”: One night in Papua a
vati-tana (devil-devil) called on me. The door and
windows of my room were securely , fastened, only
the skylights and ventilators near the roof being
open. J lay on a camp-stretcher’ under a mosquito-
net. I had blown out the candle, and' was settling
into my pillow when I felt the net being gently
raised, and a little soft hand clasped my wrist. • I
snatched 'my arm free, lighted the candle and looked
around the room. It was empty and the door ami
windows were still closed. I had just returned from
a camp hospital, and a good deal of my kit lay
about conveniently lor any human being to stumble
over in the darkness. The absolute silence was most
uncanny. I thoroughly examined every part of the
verandah which led from my door, and although it
was raining there were no signs of wet footsteps.
To prove I had not been dreaming I wore an ugly
bruise around my wrist for the next few days.
“There are stranger things than that in New Guinea.”
was the consolation I got when I mentioned the
matter to the oldest inhabitant.
“Ba rcoo”: At Brighton Downs, on the
head of the Diamantina Waters, years ago there was
a blackboy belonging to the Burke River abos. He
had been there for a long while and was apparently
quite civilised; but later it was found that his
belief in the superstitions of his people was stronger
than Ins hold on civilisation, There had been
trouble over a gin he had brought home with him
to the station from the tribe, and one day a walk-
about Binghi of the same colony of abos. told him
he had been “boned” by one of his fellows 120
miles away. That was the end of “Billy Boy.” Ho
took to his humpy, and in 10 days’ time was dead
meat. Bingliis in the far north-west of Queensland
can die just as soon as they like, in the same
fashion as the South Sea or Pacific Islanders.

“Bandy Andy”: Here’s something new.
Clear-glass bottles lying exposed along (he river
tracks in West Queensland gradually change color
(ill they become deep violet, while glass in windows
in the same locality retains its original transpar-
ency, Whaffor?
“Moana”: Waitara (M.L.) beheld a joy-
ous spectacle the other day in a Maori lady of ex-
tensive pedigree who strained the scales at ,‘iOst.,
and persisted in parading the main street robed in
heliotrope! She was the chief witness, as well as
the most gorgeous incident, at a sitting of the
Native Land Court.
“Barcoo” : Does any Abo.-writer know
anything about the snake erroneously called the
“tiger” in Queensland? Has it been known to kill
any animal or human being? The reptile
is brown in color, lint the head and back for six to
nine inches are of an ebony blackness. When full
grown the beast’s length runs from five to nine feet.
It is generally found in sandhills or rocky nobs.
It shows fight when bailed up; otherwise it has
none of the characteristics of the true tiger, which
flourishes in the river bends of the Goulburn, in
Vic. If numbers count that is its true home in
Australia. The Q’l’d crawler is one of the boa-
constrictor family, known as the rock python, with
the mouth of the carpet snake. It is devoid of
the deadly single poison fang of the tiger proper.
SOME SCOTCH ABOUT HIM.
“I come from a distinctively Scotch family,
y’know.”
“That’s what pa said. It’s in your very
breath, he told ma.”
“D.F.” : Tasmania has one curious exhibit
on the question of the durability of Australian hard-
woods. Old Bobby Knopwood, the chaplain who came
out to Port Phillip, and then crossed over to Tas- .
mania with Collins, had a housekeeper named Man-
Made, who died in 1808, when the Derwent settle-
ment was only four years old. They buried her in
old St. David’s cemetery, and put up a slab of blue-
gum instead of a headstone. This slab is preserved
in the Botanical Museum in Hobart. The part that
was underground has partly decayed ; but the upper
end is as sound as a bell, and the inscription is per-
fectly legible.
MARY.
VOICE FROM TELEPHONE: “Is that Dr. Smith? Mrs. Broun speaking. I want you to
come and see my Utile Mary.”
DOCTOR: “Ha, ha! What’s the trouble?”
VOICE: “I’m afraid it’s unripe quinces.”
DOCTOR: “Well, why on earth”
VOICE: “Oh, she is screaming terribly!”
DOCTOR: “Who is?”
VOICE: “My little girl, I told you. Do hurry!”
“McNorth”: The strangest war I ever
attended was in far-inland Papua. With a long
string of carriers I camped for a week or so at a
mountain village 10 days from the coast. On the
third day after my arrival the villagers began making
warlike preparations, and I learned that the head-
man had delivered an ultimatum to
another village across the way to the
effect that he would bring the white
man and his guns and his own warriors
to knock seven hells out of it. I had
to forcibly intimate to the ingenious
chief that I was a strict neutral. The
belligerent villages faced each other
from the ridge-tops across a deep gully,
and the painted, befeathered warriors
of the rival camps put in time gesticu-
lating and brandishing their weapons
and swapping insults until it was con-
sidered that the populaces had been
worked up to the proper pitch. Then
our old general started the war by
leading a charge down the hillisde. He
stopped 50 yards from the boundary,
and all hands fired arrows, spears and
pointed remarks into the enemy’s terri-
tory. Then they raced back to their
village. About 50 of the enemy villa-
gers then charged down from their
side, and, picking up the spears and
arrows which had been fired across the
gully, shot them back again. Then
they retreated. Our side repeated the
manoeuvre, and the enemy counter-
attacked as before. The same ammuni-
tion served both sides all the time. After two
days of this carnage peace was declared. The
casualties were: Killed, nil; wounded, one spear,
which hit a stone and broke its head ; missing, two
arrows. It was the most economical campaign on
record.

“Leo Lear”: If tlie Abo.-scribes who are
inquiring for a cure for the irritation caused by
contact with a prickly grub will apply cloudy
ammonia to the affected parts they will obtain imme-
diate relief. Dilute the ammonia with an equal
part of water. Bushmen living in grub-infested
areas, such as the coast of South Queensland, should
remember that the trail of one of the grubs across
a pillow or through wearing-apparel causes the itch
in just as great a degree as direct contact between
the insect and the skin.
“Warre”: Imported hay and grain are
likely to keep the Australian cocky busy for a few
years. I sowed a few acres of imported American
barley last autumn, and already three well-defined,
strong-growing, healthy varieties of weed are dis-
puting with the barley which of them is going to be
the crop. The cocky who goes through his paddocks
carefully now and roots out every pest is going to
save the recording angel’s shorthand staff a lot of
overtime.
“Rag”: “W.F.” (B. 14/10/T5) tells
“Grasshopper” that, if he rubs his hens’ fruit with
leaves of the stinging-tree, and puts them where his
dog- can get them, the cur will never again attempt
to breakfast off eggs. That’s all humbug. It is the
down on the plant which bites. This down is simply
countless microscopic prickles, and it can be broken
almost with one’s breath. Then the plant is ren-
dered quite innocuous, and can be chewed or sat
on without any inconvenience.
* * * *
“Sarto” : There’s a mysterious epidemic
killing horses in Southern Riverina. There are no
symptoms; the attacked moke just lies down any-
where and lifts the lid off. Two post-mortems have
revealed no sign of any internal disease. One owner
employed two of his horse flock to drag away the
corpse of another, and shortly afterwards they,
too, turned their toes in. Useful hints, recipes,
etc., wanted urgently.
“Eltan Yu” : The Bulletin asks if any-
body lias ever hooked a bigger shark in Australian
waters ithan the 21-footer caught by engineer Walker,
of the Douglas Mawson. Yes. E. King landed one
of the bull-nosed variety from Frenchman’s Bay-,
Albany, which measured 26ft. 2in. On the Pearling
Grounds up north-west we see plenty of big fellows,
but, so far as I can find out, no diver has: ever been
attacked by one, although if he has a fish or a
brandy and soda in his shell-bag- a hungry sea-lawyer
will argue the point with him:
“Smilax” : We killed Strawberry at Gren-
fell (N.S.W.) the other day, and this is what we
found under her pinny: 22 pieces of stone, seven
pieces of glass, an umbrella ferrule, 40 bits of tin
and sundries, a 2|in. nail, and X}. horse teeth. The
lot weighed lflb., and the details were worn quite
smooth. Deceased was taken off clean country on
the late F. T. Gibson’s Caragabal property, on the
Bland.
The schooner Watson West blew into Port
Adelaide lately, and Captain Sorensen told this mov-
ing story:— r-
When 60 miles south of Lord Howe Island, while
standing one morning on the poop, he was struck-a
violent blow on the left shoulder by a huge flying-
fish, which then fell at his feet.... Had the fifh
struck him on the head it would probably have frac-
tured his skull. • *.
Ancient mariners who have had their skulls frac-
tured by a fish please speak up.
* *• * *
“Jaques”: Will some hon. member of the
Abo. Assembly tell me how to keep blood-sticking
flies off horses? Oil of citronella, oil of eucalyptus,
lysol, cylin, phenyl, tobacco infusion, kerosene emul-
sion, and castor-oil emulsion have all been tried and
found wanting. Castor-oil seems to be about the
best, but the horses I know shake their heads sadly
over its qualifications for (be job.
“Veritas”: Talking about the passing of
the side-saddle, in the beginning of last century in
the Hunter (N.S.W.) district my grandmothers rode
on pillows behind their husbands, when going to
church. Before pole-drays appeared many families
navigated themselves in drays drawn by a bullock,
and, later, in drays drawn by two bullocks. Then
followed the horse dray and the spring-cart. Mrs.
Lang, mother of the Rev. Dr. Lang, when visiting
East Maitland, rode on a bullock led by a convict
servant.
* * * *
“Oriole” : When the inspector arrived hi'
proceeded to his hotel, ordered a nice little lunch
and sent for his customary driver. When the whip
was shown into the dining-room his fordship said,
“Ah, good morning, Smith; I want you to take me
to Dog-sham to-morrow morning. And —er —we have
departmental instructions to reduce our incidental
expenditure. You are accustomed to a fee of 15s.
Do you not think ten a sufficient recompense?”
“Well, it's this way, you see.” Smith replied ; “you
still come up here with a first-class ticket, and go
to the best pub. Now, my turnout is the best in the
town. It’s a 15-bob turn-out, in a manner of speak-
in’. But if you want me to take you for ten bob.
I'll drive you out in the spring-cart. So there you
are. Fifteen bob or ten —it’s just as you like, sir.”
Thai settled the argument.
THE SPY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
N.S.W.
A loyal man is Robinson;
lie always seems to feel
Tn every fibre of his soul
Suelf patriotic zeal.
The way in which he waves the flag
And tells us what he thinks,
Is only rivalled by the way
In which he orders drinks.
And you must listen to a man
If he has bought you beer;
And, also, after some remarks
A patriot must cheer.
Yet thinking calmly over things,
In saner moments, I
Consider Robinson was wrong
About the German spy.
It seemed suspicious, certainly,
While drinks in triumph swept,
Rank after rank, across the bar
That Johnson sober kept.
He filled his glass with soda, while
Our joyous drinks went by;
Till sternly Robinson remarked:
“That man’s a German spy!
“He’s keeping- sober while we drink,
And learning all we know.
No man would so refrain from boor
Unless to tell the foe.”
And we were all concerned, because
He, haply, might make known
A plan for conquering the Huns
That Robinson had shown.
Quoth Henry, keeping well away,
“/ order his arrest!”
And his resistance we subdued
Although he did his best.
And then, at Robinson’s request,
We had a drink or two,
And held a grim court-martial there
To see wnat we would do.
’Twas Jones who struck the bright idea:
“We’ll try the German plan
Of forcing tribute from the folk
Who fall beneath their ban!”
To this the captive soon agreed;
Perchance he was afraid
Of something worse. Till closing time
For drinks the traitor paid.
Yet Robinson and he I met
In town this very day;
And we partook of sundrj' drinks
In quite a friendly way.
And Henry said—this makes me think
That he was far from right:
“What happened to that German spy
We caught the other night?”

I' ADVANC
AUSTRALIA’S FUTURE!
ITS TRADE. ITS INDUSTRIES.
ONE lesson the war has taught is that Australians must make this country as self contained as possible.
They must build up industries that will employ Australian workmen, in lieu of importing goods and sending
money overseas to build up the prosperity of other countries to the detriment of their own National expansion
and prosperity do not follow along those lines. This country calls for more people, but not more imported goods.
Take the Rubber Goods Trade in the Commonwealth. The imports into this country, during the twelve months
previous to the war, totalled over j£350,000 and yet there was
No need for one penny of this huge sum to have gone
out of the Commonwealth, except for raw materials.
The sum mentioned meant the employment of thousands of hands, but unfortunately not Australian hands. The
work could and should have been done here, and Australia would have benefited, and users of Rubber Goods would
have benefited, for in addition to keeping the money circulated in the country, they would have had satisfaction,
for despite the influx of foreign-made Rubber Goods, the Australian-made article has gained ground and beaten
the imported goods for Quality, Workmanship and Price.
There’s not one sound reason why Australians
should prefer imported Rubber Goods!
Quality for quality—and price for price—we, as the largest Rubber Manufacturers in the Southern Hemisphere,
can supply your requirements in this direction, and with a better article and at no greater cost—in fact in most
instances at less than the imported goods. Furthermore, we are on the spot to stand by our reputa’ion for
Quality, Service and Satisfaction. The name “ Dunlop” is a household word in Australia to-day, and it is
synonymous with the highest standard in the Rubber World. We manufacture:—
MOTOR TYRES
(Pneumatic and Solid)
CYCLE TYRES
VEHICLE TYRES
TENNIS BALLS
RUBBER HEELS
MINING GOODS
SNORTING GOODS
PLUMBERS’ GOODS
ENGINEERING REQUISITES
WATERPROOF GARMENTS and RUGS
RUBBER TILES—MATTING
HOSES-GARDEN, ENGINEERING, &c.
MILKING MACHINE REQUISITES
Etc. Etc.
These goods are worthy of this country and the workmen that make them. They at present command
—owing to their reputation for Quality and Service—a big trade throughout the length and breadth of the
Commonwealth—a reputation they have justly earned, and one we are determined to uphold. This trade can
be doubled if unjustifiable preference for imported wares is overcome. Our Mill workers can be raised
from 1,400 to 2,800 and our annual wage sheet inci eased from £150,000 to £300,000 It’s a result that you can
help achieve, if you will always specify “DUNLOP” branded Rubber Goods, and see that you get them. You
thereby not only help yourself by obtaining a superior article every time, but you help to materially assist in
the expansion of the industries of our Country

A REMARKABLE FEAT
BY OXY-ACETYLENE
is demonstrated by the illustration, which shows how an old and worthless boiler, forty years
of age and of enormous dimensions, was cut into small pieces and carried away from a
confined situation in the basement of a printing works. The whole work, under
the most difficult of situations, was finished in two days. Without OXY-AtM jLL.Ki.NE
the work would have taken weeks, and the whole of the printing machinery and plant would
have been idle and disorganised for weeks in excavation and dismantling work.
EVERY ENGINEER and all interested should write in for free catalogues, giving
pictures and detailed description of this and other remarkable engineering achievements. Ihe
total length of cutting done in the two days, by one man. was 344 ft. 6in. of a single
thickness of lin. plate, and 18ft. Sin. of the double thickness of 2in. plate.
THROUGHOUT GREAT BRITAIN, AMERICA AND THE CONTINENT the
OXY-ACETYLENE process is being more extensively used day by day for cutting up
iron and steel structures, such as old boilers, tanks, bridgework, etc.
Every Australian Engineer should be able to speak with facility and confidence of the OXY-ACETYLENE
Cutting and Welding Process.
Those workshops which are rapidly adding the process to their equipment include manufacturers, contractors,
repair shops, foundries, steel mills and railroad shops.

A goldfields municipality in the West
was recently put into a financial hole by an
official, and some of the councillors have
guaranteed it at the bank for £BOO. Re-
cently the official, who owned racehorses and
other uncertainties, disappeared, and is now
stated to be at the other end of the world.
The usual investigation of accounts showed
a shortage of approximately £3OO for the
preceding six months ; the auditors did not
go further back, as they felt that the coun-
cillors might not be able to stand the dis-
closures. Prior to departing, the official
presented the local Church of England with
a complete set of up-to-date electric fittings,
for which he was suitably thanked at a
meeting of vestrymen. Now r the Council is
rude enough to intimate that the fittings
were its property, and are demanding pay-
ment. The ratepayers are taking it all
quite philosophically, and are asking no
questions except when presented with
accounts for alleged unpaid rates for which
they hold receipts. On such occasions the
interest they display is apt to be almost
volcanic.
“Fruitgrower”: “Quidam” (P>. 23/9/T5l
yaps at the Australian fruit man and boosts
the Yankee apple-grower, who, paying Bs.
a day wages, makes a fortune with fruit
at 4s. a case. This sweeping condemnation
of Australian effort, so common with the
partially informed, is unjustified; likewise
it is tommy-rot. Yankee methods are suit-
able with like conditions, as at Mildura,
Remnark and parts of Tasmania, and there
they are followed and improved on ; but the
hilltop cultivation of County Cumberland
(N.S.W.) and many other districts is
another proposition. Wages are 7s. to Bs.
a day, and growers generally are not grumb-
ling at the profits. With deep soil and regu-
lar seasons, as in Oregon, we could make
fortunes with fruit at 4s. a case; and in
spite of handicaps many of us do make for-
tunes. Very few are hard up. The
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture aided
by a Yank fruit “expert” tried its
hand at Richmond and Dural with
dreadful financial results. It, is not
the best-quality fruit that pays best;
but the out-of-season and often inferior
stuff. Frequently poor cultivation pays bet-
ter than good. Both in Victoria and
N.S.W. the whooping Yank has tried fruit
growing and tucked his tail in. Australian
agriculture in all its forms, barring irriga-
tion. is a special proposition requiring local
experience, and all comparisons with other
countries are futile.
“F.IT.”: Garages are going cheap in Mel-
bourne these hard times. Lately a wealthy
Malvern man, having lots of time and little
to do with it, bought out a bargain motor-
works. In order to see that his man-and-
boy give fair value for their wages, he puts
in a large part of the day at the shop.
One morning a clutch-repair job came along.
Next day the finished job lay on the floor
beside the nietal-latlie, and near it there also
lay the face-plate of the machine —the two
articles being not entirely dissimilar, just as
an egg and an apricot are not entirely dissimi-
lar. The owner came bustling in. “Got that
clutch done for Mr. Blundy-Bunder, Smith V”
he asked. “Yessir.” said the foreman, from
the depths of another job. “It’s over there
by the lathe.” The boss went and took a
good look at the first object that caught his
eye. It happened to be the face-plate. “Ah,
yes,” he said, “yes.” Then, heartily: “And
a very good job y’ made of it, too —a very
good 'job !” Nothing in being a boss if one
can’t recognise worth in a worker and his
work.
“S.T.S.”: An energetic manufacturing
country, we are! My small boy lately sent
Is. Gd. to a widely-advertised “Manufacturing
and Agency Co.” for a mask as per cata-
logue. The money promptly came back,
with a polite note: “Regret we are unable
to supply. Will let you know as soon as
the new stock arrives.” And that note is
printed. Honest, of course, to turn away
money rather than supply a makeshift
article. But what sort of enterprise is it
that-cannot cut out or stick together a bob’s-
worth of calico and cardboard, but sits down
to refuse orders —on a scale that makes it
worth while to have the refusal printed—as
soon as Germany ceases to supply the cheap
rubbish ?
“Quidam’s” rejoinder : —-
“Cripps C.,” in his courteous criticism of my
par re Yankee fruitgrowers’ methods (B. 7/10/45),
misses the main point of the argument—that in
America it has been found that the forcing of all
fruitgrowers to conform to certain standards in
packing fruit has a very beneficial effect on the
industry. Here there is no real standard, so that
even if a man wanted to adhere to it he couldn’t.
When a young Australian, anxious to learn all he
can about the industry, has the enterprise to travel
to California and work among the orchards there
for experience, the superiority of the compulsory
standard is one of the features he notes with com-
mendation. “Cripps C.” exemplifies the position
taken up by the average fruitgrower here ; none of
the disadvantages of the industry are due to his
fault, but the Government, the railways, the labor
market, etc., cannot be sufficiently blackguarded.
This is why so very little in the way of improve-
ment results. As to compulsory grading, with a
standard adhered to by everyone, the grower would
know that when he sees, say, extra-choice apples
or orangies quoted at 10s. or 12s. a case,
that’s the price he should get. At present it is
quite possible for his selling agent to return him
less and say that the fruit was much inferior to
what was quoted at that price. “Cripps C.’’ may
not have experienced this, but many growers have,
and rightly or wrongly they assert that they have
been “taken down’’ in consequence. Perhaps they
are right, and perhaps the agent is; the trouble is
that nobody knows. The more our growers organise
the better, and the more they adopt the best methods
in vogue elsewhere the better, too. Because trans-
port facilities are rotten, which they are, it is
not necessary to deride reforms like compulsory
grading, which have been found beneficial where the
industry is larger and better-run than here. When
growers become homogeneous and single-minded
enough to bring about one necessary reform, they will
have less difficulty in obtaining the others.
* * * »
“ J.P.”: Anyone looking for a gamble 12
months ago couldn’t have done better than
buy a second-hand ship. Prices have been
bounding up since then, and some remark-
able deals have taken place. They have
generally been in foreign vessels, values
of these being higher than of British steam-
ers, for obvious reasons. A Greek boat
bought for £25,000 before the war changed
hands the other day for £75,000. This means
about £lO per ton as against £3 before Bill
went mad. Another tramp sold in Novem-
ber for £20.000 was turned over recently at
£45,000, and her present owners could get
a good rise even on that figure.

The Anglican congregation of a wealthy
down-south suburb still chuckles reminis-
cently over the limit in parsons’ wives with
whom it bore for many years, amid much
suppressed mirth. In the name of charity,
while making an afternoon call, she would
produce from the folds of her wide skirts a
pot of home-made jam or a jam-sandwich
and offer it for sale to a perfect stranger.
Glad rags begged from rich parishioners for
the poor would presently appear in family
use at the vicarage, quite undisguised. On
one occasion the flock of worshippers bought
a phaeton for the rectory’s use. _ Promptly Mrs.
Rector decided to take a trip to England,
sold the vehicle without delay, and added the
cash to her pocket-money. Once when there
was going to be a wedding in the family she.
issued invitations, and waited for the pre-
sents to come in. These she considered in-
adequate and therefore issued an extra
invitation list, twice the size of the original
one. Then, on the morning of the wedding-
day, an announcement appeared in the daily
press, declaring the reception “off,” for
family reasons. Thu® the price of the sand-
wiches was saved and put to reserves. The
event of her life was a large afternoon

Although I know the grocer brings
Raisins and butter, prunes and rice,
And bulging bags of tasty things —
Crisp, sugared peels and fragrant spice,
And though the butcher makes his charge
For primest kidneys, steaks and chops,
I only know the bills are large,
And somehow there the matter drops.
Scones from the shop across the street,
And nice, pink salmon in a tin,
These are the only things to eat
That Mabel has when 1 come in.
But whiffs about the kitchen cling,
And sacrificial odors strange
A weird enchantment seem to fling
From out the cooling kitchen range,
And in the loamy garden bed
Peculiar parcels are interred —•
But Mabel’s pretty eyes are red,
So all inquiry is deferred.

Every Woman Can Acquire a Good
We will gladly tell any woman who writes
us the secret of how many hostesses and
actresses develop their figures and fill out the
hollows of their cheeks. The hollow-necked,
scrawny-armed and flat-chested woman is
always at a great disadvantage, socially, with
her well-developed associates. She who is
most fully developed is a source of envy to her
illy-developed sisters.
If you are flat and hollow-chested, and
suffer from attenuation, we will tell you, free
of charge, how you may develop your figure to
pleasing proportions. Thousands of women
in similar health have accepted and followed
this advice, and are to-day, as the result,
radiant in the enjoyment of good health, a
pleasing, fully-developed figure. Attenuated
women who have for years suffered the
ravages of indigestion, constipation, bilious-
ness, internal functional disorders and various
other troubles are numbered in this category.
WEIGH and MEASURE
WHAT YOU SHOULD.
In many
cases bust
measure-
ments have
been in-
creased by
over ten inches, and the weight over five
pounds weekly. Other cases have shown an
increase in weight of even a pound a day.
The average bust increase desired is about six
inches, which is readily accomplished.
If your bust lacks development, and you are
scraggly and attenuated, we will advise you,
free and gladly, how you may improve your
figure. When you look into the mirror, and
your hollow cheeks, thin neck and scrawny
arms mock even you, what effect do you sup-
pose they have on those with whom you mix
socially?. ... A woman’s chief charm is a
well-rounded figure. With these, thin arms
and hollow cheeks are a rarity.
WHAT A NURSE SAYS OF IT.
Manager, “Flesh-Food” Co., Gympie, Q.
Dear Sir, —As a nurse, I was very interested
in your Flesh-Food treatment, and was
greatly surprised at the wonderful results in
my ease. When I first wrote to you I was
only skin and hone, and I have good eause to
be thankful that I wrote you for a free
sample, for I feel certain now that I am one
of the very best advertisements you could pos-
sibly have, as I am developed in every way
satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a
good while to prove if it was lasting in its
effect, and I am now glad to say that your
splendid treatment has done all you claimed
it would, my weight and measurements being
ample.—l am, yours gratefully,
MRS. E. WING ROVE.
BEST POSSIBLE TREATMENT,
The .Manager. Herons Creek.
Dear Sir, —Words fail to entirely express my
gratitude for what your great remedy lias
done for me. I think Flesh-Food is the best
treatment possible under ihe circumstances,
because it is more than certain in its effect.
I have gained satisfactorily in weight, also
in measurements, and health greatly improved
as the result of your treatment. With many
thanks and kind regards.—Yours gratefully,
MRS. ELIZABETH MCCARTHY.
LET US SEND YOU SCORES OF
GRATEFUL LETTERS THAT WILL
PROVE TO YOU WHAT WE HAVE
DONE FOR OTHERS.
DID ALE YOU SAID IT WOULD.
The Manager. Gidginbung, via Temora.
Dear Sir, —I will need no further treatment,
as it lias done for me all you said it would
do. I have gained the necessary weight, also
bust measurements required, and my health is
wonderfully improved; in fact, you would not
take me for the same person as I was before
using your remedy.—l am, yours sincerely,
MISS 31. HARTLNG.
FICURE!
It is the thousands of friends made by
our treatment that encourages us to urge
you to the utmost to lose no possible oppor-
tunity of undertaking its use.
EXCEEDED EX PKCTATIOXS.
The Manager, Esperance. IV.A.
Dear Sir, —Yours to hand. I am pleased to tell
you that the result of your Flesh-food has fully
exceeded my expectations. I have put on flesh
and increased weight so rapidly that I discon-
tinued taking the treatment, although I have
about a quarter of the supply left, as' I was afraid
I would get too stout. I am very grateful to you
for your attention, and I cannot speak too highly
of your remedy, which I will recommend when-
ever I have an opportunity.—Yours truly,
E W. NELSON.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepaved for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Non-SKid Tyres.
For the hard road-for the hot pace—for the long
grind—for true economy and service.
The success of Firestone Tyres has proved that the motorist
can have comfort, safety and the ** most miles per shilling.”
Firestone Tyres are preferred because of highest quality at the least
cost —as the greatest value, even though there are ** cheaper *’ tyres.
The rubber in them is supremely good. It has the quality of greatest heat-
resistance, of greatest wear endurance. Every Firestone Tyre contains an extra quantity
j of this extremely good rubber.
The Non-skid lettering is an imprint of safety. On every highway of the world it
challenges the need of other anti-skid safeguards. It holds the standard for endurance
and economy. The letters prevent spin or skid in any direction, they radiate the heat
of road friction, insure perfect traction with gasoline economy, car-protection and
comfort beyond contradiction.

Firestone Tyres are made by specialists in the largest
exclusive tyre factory in the world. This year’s Firestone
output has increased 78 per cent. Firestone are tyres of
greatest strength, sturdiness and safety—-

THE ROYAL BANK OF QUEENSLAND LIMITED.
The Sixtieth Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the Royal Bank of Queensland Limited,
held in the Banking House, Queen Street, Brisbane, on Tuesday, 26th October, 1915.
Mr. Thomas Welsby, Chairman of Directors, presided.
The General Manager read the notice convening the meeting.
The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the Report and Balance-sheet, said:
“Gentlemen: In reviewing the business transactions of your Bank durin
ing the past six months, a
period I may be’ allowed to name as one most trying to the many financial institutions of Australia, y
will, I trust, permit me to give customary comparisons as adopted hitherto on such occasions as tliat
you
of
“The net profit for the half-year ending 30th September, 191,), shows £15,465 1/s. /d., a smaller
profit when compared with the profits for the half-year of 31st March last, viz.— £17,223 12s. lOd.
“Taking the amount of profit mentioned for the September period, and adding to this the amount ot
£2223 2s. 4d. brought forward from the previous balance, it would have been an easy task tor us to
have declared our customary dividend, but your Directors, considering, under existing circumstances,
business probabilities in the future, have deemed it prudent to revert to the dividend paid to you in the
month of October, 1913.
“Exchanges and London business have dropped to an extent, whilst in certain quarters, advances have
been sought for that would have been advantageous to us. That there has been what I had best teim
not been sought .... ....... ......... o ~ , , „ , , ,
a shrinkage in business generally during the past 12 months is well known to all observant and thinking
commercial individuals —the reason for such shrinkage not being necessary for me to recapitulate —the
most serious one being the marked unfavorable conditions that have prevailed 1 sorry to sa.\
are
give
still prevailing) in Western Queensland, more so than is commonly known or understood.^
“Let me give one instance why business, even other than Banking, has not been maintained: -An
annual review and compilation of statistics relating to wool issued by a well-known Australian firm, has
stated that during the year 1914/1915 a decrease of 217,983 bales of wool occurred in Australia, whilst it
is expected that the clip for 1915/1916 will show a further decrease of 500,000 bales in comparison with
that for the season lately closed. What this means to trade and commerce needs no comment from me.
“I am far from talking in a pessimistic strain, yet I think you will agree with me that these are not
the times for continuous increasing business of a thoroughly profitable nature, assuring you as shareholders
that your Board is as careful and cautious as they can be in all their doings on your behalf.
“Reverting to the figures as given in our Balance-sheet, I refer first to capital. This remains the
same, whilst uncalled liability on shares voluntarily prepaid shows a slight increase of £lOO. Preference
shares remaining the same. Bills payable give an increase of £18,889, and deposits £23,641.
“Comparing the assets, we find coin on hand and cash at Bankers show an increase of £39,10/.
Australian Notes held advancing by £84,342. Our total liquid assets have advanced from £766,048 in
March last to £868,927 at the present time of review, an increase of £102,879, equal to 51.1% of our
total liabilities to the public. . ~ . . , ,
“Bank Premises give an increase of £2331, chiefly by purchases of properties m country districts and
a few minor additions to previously held premises. I am a firm believer in having freehold premises in
all country towns where our branches are established, such holdings being a certain bona fides to clients
and residents of the town and district with whom we carry on banking business and facilities.
“Bills Discounted, and all other debts due to theßank are less by £62,925.
“Taking the profit as mentioned, we recommend its distribution as follows: —
To dividend for the half-year at the rate of 5% p.a. £13,152 16 9
on all shares
To interest on capital prepaid (at the rate of the
dividend)
To Income Tax . .
To Reserve Fund

“I feel sure you will share with me a deep regret at the long and continued illness of one of our
Board viz., Mr. William Davies, trusting that he will soon be restored to his generally good health.
“Death has claimed during the half-year Mr. C. A. Clarke, for many years your esteemed auditor.
Mr. F. M. Hart, a well-known accountant of the city, and for many years engaged in banking business,
has been elected in place of Mr. Clarke. . _ ,
“Like the other banking institutions and commercial houses, we have lost a number of our staff by
their enrolment to the Front. Whilst regretting their departure from the service, we cordially appreciate
their enlistment. , , „ , . , „. . .„
“My remarks of the last year still hold good when I say that any officer returning to Brisbane, it
desirous of re-entering our service, will be heartily welcome, and reinstated as near as possible to the
position previously held.”
The adoption of the Report and Balance-sheet was seconded by Mr. A. McLeod, supported by Messrs.
J. W. Wassell and N. E. Amos, and. carried unanimously.
Mr. Josiah Young moved a vote of thanks to the Directors, General Manager and staff of the Bank.
This was seconded by Mr. Wm. McGregor, and carried by acclamation. , _
Mr Thomas Weisby responded for the Directors, and Mr. E. D. Day on behalf of himself and the stan.
On’the motion of Mr. William McGregor, seconded by Mr. J. W. Wassell, it was unanimously agreed
that the Bank send a letter to Mr. William Davies expressing the sympathy of the shareholders in his
protracted and serious illness.
The Chairman then declared the dividend payable, and the meeting closed.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Treasurer Lyons, of the Speck, has set a
sensible precedent in having his Budget
Speech printed and laid on the table of the
House. The system of delivering a Budget
in the form of a long, dull speech is one
of the many hoary customs we have copied
from the Grandmother of Parliament. It
is a mere waste of time, because when the
Treasurer has made his statement the House
always adjourns to give members a chance
to read it and find out what it was all about.
THE MODERN TANTALUS.
The Socialist leader, Herr Wurm, declares that
misery such as is now being endured has never
hitherto been known in Germany.—War item.
The Hughes Government is preparing to
carry its Referenda proposals to the country.
These amendments are necessary to give the
Australian Parliament full control of Aus-
tralian industries. But it is not much good
getting control of Australian industries if
there are no industries to control : and
unless Hughes gets busy a lot of them
will not survive the shock of peace.
Already the German is devising means io
dodge the super-charge he expects will be
aimed at his products. About one-third of
Switzerland is German in language, senti-
ment and blood; and into those cantons are
now pouring goods, agents and machinery by
which the enemy hopes to conduct an export
trade after the war. The Gerliog takes it
for granted that the brands of Caliban and
Cain will not he placed on the products of
neutral Powers. So he is erecting in Swit-
zerland factories in which goods practically
made in Germany will be finished off and
branded “Made in Switzerland,” and shipped
to the Allies’ markets as the products of a
neutral.
A MAN TO BE REMEMBERED.
The officer in command drew a large service pistol,
aimed, and blew out her brains while she lay at
his feet.— Cable.
FRAULEIN PIGGELBAUM: “Ach, lieber Herr
Major! And in it true that you are
actually , really and truly, the gallant
hero who was so brave as to shoot the
Cavell nurse woman?"
MAJOR: “On mein sacred vordt of
honor, AS AN OFFUTZER UNDT A YENDLE-
MAN......JA!”
"Hermes ’ : The talk of excluding Germau-
made goods after the war is grimly humorous,
considering that even now, while the conflict
is raging, it does not seem possible to ex-
clude them altogether. During the first six
months of Hilo X. S. Wales alone, according
to the Customs Department’s returns, bought
±I42S worth of German-made cliassi, £250
W(U-th of German-made motor-car bodies and
£47 worth of German-made motor-cycles.
Presumably they were ail old stocks on hand
m Britain and elsewhere. But the fact re-
mains that even at the height of the struggle
we are still getting German-made goods. The
writer blundered over this fact in his daih
toil because,his business brings him in con-
tact with motor-cars. Presumably the same
thing is happening in every other' branch of
trade. But the Fiscal-sinkers of the Labor
party either cannot or will not see it; and
their blindness is going to hit their constitu-
ents hard, and right in the neck, in the near
future.
If Premier Peacock expects to find no
changes made in his Bill for the temporary
control of the Melbourne cable-tramway sys-
rmlu l ,a l J( -‘r tears lie has miscalculated.
4he measure provides that live Government-
nominee directors shall manage the concern
until a final settlement is made. These five,
who are to get £250 a year apiece, may
borrow up to half a million in order to
acquire such properties, machinery and roll-
ing stock from the Tramway Co. as they
require. Presumably (lie whole Tramway
Co.’s outfit is to be taken over; but there is
no certainty as to when the “final settle-
ment” will occur, and that is where the Bill
will strike trouble. The City Council has a
large interest in the system, and it will see
the Government in the trenches before it con-
sents to hand over what it considers its
rights (o the State generally; and as the
City Bumbles are very friendly .with the
House of Fat. that - body, will probably
“amend” the measure with a brick.
Another foolishness that the war seems to
have killed is that of importing serums,
vaccines, anti-toxins, etc. When the menin-
gitis epidemic broke out it was discovered
that Australia had run out of serum, and
the U.S.A. were rushed for a supply. It
arrived in due course, hut it isn’t much good
—serums imported from a great distance
very rarely are. So the Australian Govern-
ment is getting into the business, and as a
factory can be run for £3OOO a year, and as
Australia imported £15,000 worth of these
preventives and remedies in 1013, it ought to
pay. London’s Lister Institute costs £5OOO a
year, and yields, it is said, an income of
£ll,lOO.
After Octavius Beale had addressed N. S.
Wales manufacturers the other day on the
subject of Australian industry and German
trade, Governor Strickland brought the meet-
ing right up to the point, with one question:
Well, what are we goixg to bo about it except
TALK?
And nobody answered him. Not that his
Ex. wanted an answer—he knows what will
be done mostly. A lot of food will be con-
sumed, and three cheers will be frequently
given, and large windbags will exude hot air
and shouts of "Never again!” will smite the
Australian ear from the Leeuwin to the
line. And tin* party politician will remain
in liis hole squeaking about having had his
tail trodden on ; and steamers will continue
to arrive crammed to the smoke-stacks with
the output of foreign factories—and then
the local statesman will tioat another loan
for Australia to buy Yankee asparagus and
German socks from Sweden. Why, even at
this moment the Sydney Telegraph is
weeping and wailing because we are import-
ing so little that the poor farmers can't get
back-loading for their wheat!
W hile members of the Tasmanian Assem-
bly were almost unanimously prepared—in
the interests of their country, of course —to
put off the joys of a general election from
early next year to March, 1917, the House
of Dodery's members, who were not getting
any extended tenure of their seats, have
with equal unanimity booted out the Bill to
ratify this little arrangement. The politi-
cal co-operation idea was wearing very thin,
anyway, for on the same day that the Bill
was chucked out by the House of Dodery a
motion of want of confidence in the Govern-
ment came on in the other place. The
general election will probably come on in
February.
W. G. Higgs, who lias been put right up
into the Australian Treasury at one lift, got
on to the question of finance just before his
elevation, and made these remarks at Rock-
hampton :
After the Napoleonic wars Great Britain’s debt
was £900,000,000 and her population 30,000,000.
Therefore our Australian population of 5,000,000
should he able to carry a war debt of £100,000,000
—provided there was no continuation of the drought.
Unfortunately the fines don’t run parallel.
If Higgs’s right pocket owed his left: pocket
£1,000,000, Higgs wouldn’t feel that he was
in a bad way and his debt wouldn't worry
another half-stone off his hones. But if
Higgs owed somebody else the million, and
had to pay out interest regularly, thou it
would be a different proposition altogether.
And that is the relative position of Great
Britain and Australia. Certainly if it is
necessary for Australia to borrow
£100,009,000 in order to do her part in the
war, the debt will have to he incurred, and
it will be done willingly. But it is going to
he a burden, and a heavy burden—so heavy
that the State Governments which are add-
ing to their _ present debts of £350,000,000
are 'condemning the Australian people to
years of tin.- utmost hardship.
THE DEMAND FOR MUNITIONS.
So great is the demand for bagpipes at. the Front
that, manufacturers are working day and night to
keep pace with the requirements.—MUSICAL TIMES.
A member of the Holman (N.S-W.) Gov-
ernment has been vigorously denying that
the Ministry had been .brought to its
knees” over something or other. What,
cant it get that far off its stomach!
THE LAW OF GRAVITATION.
Discovered by a borrowing Treasurer.
Australia lias taken the news of Fisher’s;
appointment to London very quietly. There
has been no meeting of ardent souls to pass:
resolutions calling on the leader of tin-
democracy to carry on the great work;
nobody has expressed a feeling that
the movement to secure political andl
economic emancipation will suffer. Every-
body appears just satisfied that if Fisher
wanted to job himself into a billet and drop
out of the fight, or whatever it is. there was
no reason why he shouldn’t. Than this
attitude of the public mind no better proof
can be had of Fisher’s place in the estima-
tion of Australia. He has been a thoroughly
good party man—very honest of intention,
sombre, uninspiring and exasperatingly in-
fertile. It has been an ironical commen-
tary upon the gloomy forecasts of Fat that
the nominal head of the Labor movement in
the only country on earth having a Labor
(xovernment should be the person having very
just claims to lx- considered tin- nation's;
most Eminently Respectable citizen.
Elmslie, Labor-leader in the Vic. Assemble.,
has discovered “a large area of land within
20 miles of Melbourne, and rigln alongside
a railway-station, which has been in the same
condition for the last half-century.” Elmslie
might have made the radius 10 miles instead
of 20. For instance, between Ashburton and
East Camberwell, on
ijusl w a inner wen. on
the Outer Circle line,
there are hundreds of
acres which still carry
the tall timber of a;
forgotten age; andl
that the land is highly,
fertile is attested by,
certain farndets and!
market-gardens scat-
tered through the dis-
trict. A good many
curses sit on the chest
of laud-occupation in
Australia, and one of
them is the glorifica-
tion of the big farm,
i bis country is badly
in need of a crusader
who will preach that
the man who can make
a comfortable living
from 40 acres is a
better citizen than the
one who requires 40U
and thereby pushes the next man a mile or
so further back from market. That is the
crusade which will dot these close-in areas;
with producers.
Victoria's Minister of HealtK .T. Dry
Brown, has once more proved himself the
strong man able and willing to do and dare.
The State is battling with an epidemic of
meningitis; but Dry Brown is on the war-
path against waste, and nothing may stand
against him. Four of the Board of Health's
live sanitary inspectors have therefore been
dismissed, and the whole medical and sani-
tary staff' of the Health Department now
consists of one doctor —the Chief Health
Officer—and one inspector. This cohort will
now form itself into a unit or a battalion or
something, and deal with the Health require-
ments of a “Sovereign State - ’ comprising
over a million souls.
If Andrew Fisher wants a tag that will
attract wide attention when he gets to Lon-
don he might do a lot worse than inspire
his press-agent to advertise him as the man
who was responsible for giving a whole con-
tinent a baby bonus. He needn't be- afraid
ot that term any longer. The nations are
beginning to see that one of their great
needs when the war is over will be babies —
babies to repair the awful human waste of
war; babies that will be liable to come much
more sparingly because the great proportion
of those killed are and will be young married
men or young men who in the natural course
of things would soon be married. Fisher
might present himself as the one far-seeing
Imperial statesman who visioned all this
and made arrangements accordingly. Not
all the arrangements that may have to be
made, it is true; but some to go on with.
THE MIRAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A body of self-seeking political novices. .. .the
handful of political mushrooms who had been shaken
to the top.— Bruce Smith, to the Women’ll Liberal
League, on the Australian Labor Party,
I often think that Bruce and Bunbury John
Live in a world that’s full of visions dire :
They wonder when the nightmare will be gone,
And back again the glories men admire ;
Bruce, radiant in his oratorio fire,
And John, upon his throne of mighty state,
Deigning to guide a grateful nation’s fate.
Since the beginning of the world had been
That sight, to make the meanest pulses throb;
But on that Age of Majesty serene
There fell the snarling discord of The Mob ;
Democracy, the Beast without a Bob,
Shouldered his way the ducking courtiers through—
And even yet Bruce can’t believe it’s true.
They flung John’s ball and sceptre through the door;
They ventured Bruce’s verdicts to deride,
And left him firmly sitting on the floor
Demeaned in state, yet not abased in pride:
lie waved his hand and said, “Though beggars ride
On horseback, and are tyrants over all
To-day, to-morrow we shall watch them fall.”
If may be seven years, or it may be ton,
Since first he saw that horrid vision rise;
But Bruce is still the loftiest of men,
Sitting upon the floor, he bravely cries:
“These arc but phantoms which beset my eyes,
And i did bid them fade in empty air:
I said, Ye Are Not; and they were not there.”
So, gently waving his disdainful hand,
Does Bruce keep cracking his tremendous joke:
The Upstart, gray with seasons of command,

A Remarkable Pen Picture
of Australian Bush Life
and an Absorbingly Interesting Story.
A full-size novel of 348 pages, printed on a special, light-weight paper, and hand-
somely bound in full cloth, with picture wrappetr in three colors, specially painted by
Mr. Louis McCubbin.
Read what the Age says:—
“An intimate acquaintance with Australian conditions, both ‘‘out back’ and in the city, is
revealed in ‘The Lure of the Land,’ and it has been turned to good account in the production of a
genuinely interesting novel. The picture of the drought-stricken st ait ion, with which the book opens,
js impressive in its realism, and the tragic sequel to little Mary Brown’s night ride to bring ihe
doctor is in melancholy keeping with the sombre prelude. But brighter days are in store for the
self-reliant young heroine, whose unhappy experience in childhood has bait strengthened her courage and
resourcefulness; and, bringing her broken-down father with her, she faces the task of earning a
livelihood in Melbourne. After making a start as a typiste, Mary shrefcvdly sees the possibilities That
exist in the purchase of seaside and suburban allotments. Her first 'investment is a modest one of
£lO, but it is the beginning of a steady march to success. Not that the fair student in land values
is engrossed in the pursuit to the exclusion of other interests, for sentiiSient has its claims, and heart-
aches have to be suffered before the haven of contentment is reached. The storv moves brisk]v
throughout, and the numerous people in its pages are all clearly drawn,”
“The Lure of the Land” is an attractive book that will please you. We think ii
one of the best Australian stories we have read for some time, and can recommend it
to you both for your own reading or to send to a friend outjside Australia.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Derby Day at Flemiiigton is rarely a dis-
astrous occasion for all the backers of visiting horses,
but this year it looked as though Victorian form
had been despised on insufficient evidence. Tlie good
things from Sydney were beaten very decisively, and
a lot of people who had been talking of what they
saw at Randwick lately must have dropped their
sugar over every event. The Maribyrnong Stakes
race, run in exceptionally slow time on account of
half a hurricane blowing across the course, never
gave Hulacre or Sister Satellite, the penalised cracks
from Sydney, a hope of doing the trick. In the Mel-
bourne Stakes it seemed for a moment that Garlin
would win, but Traquette outstayed Corporal
Wren’s honest battler by a neck, whilst Cagou
(3r,d) finished well ahead of Mountain Knight and
St. Carwyne. After which it was assumed that St.
Garwyne, the slow beginner, had lost a good deal of
his recent capacity for coining at the finish, though
It was suspected that he got bad luck in the run-
ning. As for the squibbish Woorak he was not
expected to stay long in front. He looked rather
out of sorts, and the books offered 12 to 1 against
him.
When Patrobas had made the A.J.C. Derby
form look pretty poor, the mystery surrounding the
busted reputation of Wallace Isinglass grew darker
than ever. Roberto Lewis, the rider of the unworthy
favorite, stated to an interviewer that he had not
been a bit sweet on his chance of winning the Derby,
tie had ridden the colt at exercise two clays pre-
viously and found him wanting in dash. So there
was no cause on Saturday morning for anyone to
expect Isinglass to reverse positions with Cetigne,
the colt that had outstayed him in the rich A.J.C.
Derby. Yet he was backed steadily at sto 4, 6 to
4, and finally 7 to 4, whilst Cetigne hardened only
n little in the betting. Who gave the rather im-
pressive son of Wallace the reputation which stuck
to him through the winter months, and still stuck
to him after he had performed like a non-stayer at
Randwick? Was it the fond owner or the books?
They quoted “Baron” Brown’s gee at a price which
increased its notoriety. There were mugs, it is said,
who took 50 to one and less about Wallace Isinglass
for the treble—both- -Derbies and Melbourne Cup.
The colt’s long-sustained favoritism seems now to
have been as false as they make ’em. He is either
an animal of not much account —not nearly as good
as he looks—or else he was short of work on Satur-
day, for his “bellows” were going a long time after
the race. Patrobas, on the other hand, seemed in
the pink of condition, but not more fit than when
he ran onlv moderately well in the Caulfield Cup,
with B. Cain up. He was then said to be a diffi™’lt
colt for a 6st. 91b. boy to manage in a crowded field,
and apparentlv a stronger jockey made all the differ-
ence. Anyway, Patrobas passed Cetigne and West-
court quite easily when he made his run on the
outside.
By winning the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday Pat-
robas landed the second leg of a double that makes
him the tenth to carry off both events, the others
having been Lantern, Briesis, Chester, Grand Flan-
eur, Martini Henry, Newhaven, Merriwee, Poseidon
and Prince Foote. The win, under a w.f.a. burden,
of course removes any doubt about the name of the
best three-year-old of the season. The colt has put
up a remarkably fine performance, compared with
which the running of Cetigne is only moderately
good. Patrobas was bred at Bringenbong, the home
of Trafalgar, on the Upper Murray, by P. and W.
Mitchell, by Wallace from' Sizzle; though
reckoned fairly smart it was not until he Won the
Doona Trial Handicap in September last year that
liis trainer suspected him of being something ientitled
to a special brand. WestCOurt’s good showing in
the big race was rather unexpected, but it has to
be remembered that this colt had mighty hard luck
in the A.J.C. Derby. Had he not been seriously
interfered with it is more than probable that he
would liave. won. The, Cup must have been a
thumping fine thing for Ikey, for it was only lately
that Patrobas came seriously’ into the’ bettiftg. He
was hardly inquired for on the two Cup double
books.

Said tlie Rev. T. F. Ruth, at Melbourne
Auditorium on Sunday, in the course of a lecture on
“Sport and War”: “Horseracing is no longer re;
garded as. a sport; it is merely a means of gam--
blihg. . . .In this community this very week, when
our Empire is passing through one of the mpst
critical periods of this colossal conflict,' we pause
to pay commercial, social and Governmental tribute
to this gigantic evil—an evil that produces wasters,
home-wreckers and criminals.” And it was only the
day before that King George’s horse Krfar Marcus
won the Queensbnry Handicap at the Newmarket
meeting. Now, what apology to his Maj. does the
Rev. T. E. Ruth propose to make?

Maoriland lost a promising horse-pilot
when W. J. Adams negotiated the Last Hurdle as
tlie result of serious injuries received while riding
Gladful at the Hawkes Bay Spring Meeting. llis
nag fell heavily and two others tumbled over him,
breaking both of his collarbones and three ribs,
wounding a lung and badly damaging his head. He
steered Ngatoa to victory in the last M.L. Grand
National.
“Barcoo”: Mention of the side-saddle
recently in The Bulletin urges me to move that the
misbegotten arrangement be prohibited in horse-
jumping competitions at Shows in Australia. I re-
call a terrible happening at Wagga (N.S.W.) Show,
in the early ’Bo’s, when a Miss Ryan met her death.
She was the champion horse-woman of the Murrum-
bidgee. At the leap her mount shied from under
her, she over-balanced on to the wrong side, her foot
slipped through the stirrup-iron and she was sus-
pended. The horse, terrified, turned himself into a
gyroscope, and the unfortunate lady’s skull was frac-
tured against the bole of a near-by gum-tree. 1 clou t
know how many similar accidents I’ve seen,
but, of course, with no such dreadful results. That
fatality would not have occurred if Miss Ryan had
ridden, as so many of her sensible sisters .are now
doing, in the jumps, in a man’s saddle. Incidentally,
many years ago a well-known horse-woman living
near Dalby (Q.) rode 90 miles, between sun and sun,
to tlie doctor with a dying child held in front of her.
She discarded the horned abomination for her hus-
band's “poley” in order to accomplish the feat.
“Two-Itoyals”: Last week tlie Sydney
police made a raid on a house in At illiam-street
and bagged a dozen Maltese playing a national card
gamble for a stake of a shilling a game. The 12
malefactors were each fined £2, in default 14 days.
The State Treasury no doubt wanted the money,
otherwise I can’t see much to justify the hunt. On
the same evening I was playing auction bridge at
Is. a hundred, and, strictly on the q.t., a stipendi-
ary magistrate was my vis-a-vis. The same week
bets totalling tens of thousands on the Melbourne
races were being' made in Sydney, and letter-
carriers were cursing the sweeps for making their
mailbags so heavy. Have the Maltese joined the
enemy ?
Herb McCoy belted the lightweight cham-
pionship of Australia out of Tommy Uren on Satur-
day at Melbourne in retaliation for losing it to that
wallop-trafficker a few weeks ago at Sydney. About
9000 worshippers of stoush attended the service and
when Bro. Quirk gave tlie Victorian his blessing
at the end of 20 rounds the “amen” was general.
Uren, who fought a good fight and had McCoy’s
backers figuring more than once on a penurious
week-end, expressed the opinion that his opponent
out-generalled him, although he was firm that Mc.’s
boxing was no better. Uren’s trouble was that
while" he was standing hv, waiting for chances to
W. H. CROKER, of the V.R.C.
get in’ his: hard-boiled right, McCoy .was accumulating
points. In the 18th round, a good chance offering,
the right landed like a chunk of lead; but it
was too close up -to gong-time,-and McCoy weathered
the trouble. It was a close call, though. After
the scrap Uren asked the winner for another flutter.
“Of course T will,'' chirruped McCoy; “I never
..nurse the title.”

“Red" Watson and Fernand Quendreaux
were to have fought tlieir battles o’er again at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday, but as there was nearly
a stone more of Watson than had been arranged for
he was told to go away and have something to eat.
Watson, who descended on Australia as a lightweight
a few months ago, will apparently be among the
heavies in a week or so. He has got up to list. 21b.
already. Frank O’Connor took Watson’s place
ag'ainst the Frenchman, and in the sixth had his
man beaten. The dazed Quendreaux got up at the
count of “two,” but altered his mind, and down he
went to his knees again. Then there was nothing
for the referee to do but declare O’Connor the
winner and allow the thankful crowd to sprint for
the trams.
“Fighting'’ Billy Murray, who came all
the way from U.S.A. to get a fearful hiding from
Darcy about a couple of months ago at Sj r dney, went
down to Melbourne with Darcy to get another wallop-
ing on Monday. The youngster dropped him at the
sixth collision, and by that time Murray had had
enough. He just stayed down and waited for the
towel.: Poor Murray! He arrived in Australia with
a fine record and far more than the average stock of
courage, but those punishing fights he had with Darcy
and McGoorty apparently took the spirit clean out of
him.

“Biff”: Re the weight question (“Bash,”
B. 21/10/’lo). The amount of avoirdupois a
“wasted” boxer can regain in an afternoon is as
elastic as a conscience, but is generally less in the
younger and lighter weights. Weighing at two o’clock
is regarded by bruisers round McGoorty’s division
as being equal to an extra 61b. .Most pugs, regain,,
within 2lb. of the tissue they take off; dispersed fat .
doesn't return the same day.
“C.H.S.”: I don’t know, no more dbfe
anybody else, exactly how much “weight” can be put
on in a limited space of time by a pug. It doesn’t
matter a jot, anyhow. In riding it is different.
There “actual” weight is a drawback. In fighting
it is not the “actual” weight that counts for suc-
cess; it is the “relative” weight, viz., the amount
of effective stuff carried by the fighter. Of this,
of course, muscle is the principal. Nerve does not
go by foot-pound measurement. But if “Bash”
wants to know how much dead weight a man can put
on in a stated time, I can tell him. Just as much
as he can swallow and retain. But it will not turn
into effective tissue in a few hours. The pug is
like the singer in so far that ho should be a perfect
judge of what he fights best on.

“I was a rumhound and a bankroll for
fair, and .1 don’t regret what I’ve done. But I tell
you, young man, pass it up.... When I was an
athlete it was my resolution and spirit that carried
all human antagonists before me. But my resolution
and spirit were of no use to me when I went up
against John Barleycorn.”— John L. Sullivan, touring
U.S.A. on a blue-ribbon campaign.

Second stage of the suggested race be-
tween Bill Webb, Maoriland’s sculling champion,
and Charlie Towns, champion of N. S. Wales: Towns
has definitely decided that ho will not challenge
Webb. Now, who’s next talk is it?
Vic. Rowing Association has fine enlist-
ment figures. Of its 2117 members, up to last week
798 had stepped into the ranks. University, with
128, heads the list; while Colac, with 2-1 out of 25
(two of whom failed to pass), is cheerful with the
best average. Coming to the sordid side of things,
the Association began the season with a credit
balance of £264, of which £lOB was profit in
1914, so that its head is high.
* * * *
“D.F.”: When war broke out the clubs
affiliated to the Tasmanian Rowing Association had
422 members. Of these, 201, including the very
pick of the State’s oarsmen, had enlisted for active
service by October 1 ; and others are still going.
Last rowing season there was such a shortage in the
senior ranks that the Association dropped its cham-
pionships and substituted a junior pennant. This
year the committee proposed to drop even the
junior pennant, but at the annual meeting the
oilier day members held that something must be
done to encourage the young rowers, and the junior
pennant is to be kept flying this season.
Trumper and “W.G, ” dead within a
few months of each other —-the “champagne .of
cricket” and the “finest old port” both drunk by
Death in his busiest year! There is an interesting
story told of their first meeting in England, when
the Old Man still captained Gloucester. “Well,
youngster,” said “W.G.,” as they shook hands, “they
tell me you’re after my record, as well as Ranji’s.”
“Oh, I shouldn’t like to say that, Doctor,” replied
Victor. “I might catch the Prince, if I’m lucky,
but even then our records put together wouldn’t
equal yours.” “H’m,” growled the black-bearded
one, “very nice of you to say so—very nice.” After
he had seen the youngster play W.G. resumed the
conversation. “D —d if you mightn’t!” he said
thoughtfully.
* * * *
Died suddenly, front heart failure, G. R.
Hazlitt, of King’s School, Parramatta, one of the
few cricketers who have represented N. S. Wales
and Vic. against each other. Although a better
bowler than a batsman his best-remembered feat was
the way he kept his wicket up in the last innings
of one of the Test matches against Warner’s team.
That unexpected resistance won the game. Hazlitt
went to England as a member of the 1912 XI, being
picked when the famous “six” revolted. His form
in that disappointing tour was not gratifying, his
best score being 35 and his bowling average 19.
He was at one time regarded as Australia’s coming
bowler, but his physique, unfortunately, was against
him.
H. O. Rock, a King’s School (Parra-
matta) lad, appears to be another of those brilliant
young batsmen who periodically flash into promi-
nence in Australia. At the school last week he banged
up 223 not out in a total of 280 for three wickets.
Twilight saved further trouble. Young Rock goes to
the University next year, and should ably help that
eleven in its present cricket troubles.
* * * *
Despite the more or less dispirited nature
of the cricket season in Sydney there is an occa-.
sional rousing item of , play. Such was Bardsley’s
114, not out, for Glebe against Balmain, on Satur-
day. It was a day for batsmen, but the Glebe crack
was the only one to get into triple figures in senior
play. In characteristic style he set about giving
the fieldsmen and bowlers a treat, but in 80 minutes,
when he was going strong, his last partner’s wicket
fell. Fifty-six of his 114 were made with strokes
for four, and his score was greater than half the
total of his side.
* * * *
“Matey”: “Hazard’s” remark (B.
21/10/’l5) about the excess number of cueists play-
ing with “molly dukes” recalls a cricket match I
joined in a few years ago at a village in the
neighborhood of Cowes (Vic.). The natives had ten
left-handed batsmen. This phenomenon was put down
to the way they mow or grow ehiekory ; but I only
vouch for the number.
* * ' * *
“First Bag” : Summer baseball is under a
favorable star in Sydney this season, but it badly
needs to turn a gun on to its uproarious “fans.”
A tumultuous performance happened the other day,
when howls and Zoo language were heaved at
umpire Mortley. It was as bad as the Stadium
crowd giving Premier Holman a tip about next
elections. Baseball is always pregnant of riot, but
the game cannot live if its umpires are to be baited
—not in Australia, anyhow. With managerial firm-
ness baseball has come to stay; without it, it is
on the rocks.
A. Mcßeath, of Cessnock (N.S.W.), who
won the five-mile scratch race, and was barely beaten
in the mile handicap, was the star pedaller at the
Eight-Hour cycling carnival at Sydney last week.
In the mile he wheeled the distance from scratch
(at 10yds.) in lmin. 55sec., a particularly hurried
effort. Incidentally, the name of another speedy
rider in his day was in the papers again this week,
but. in a- column where his friends didn’t want to
find it. :.\. M. Brennan, whose death was reported,
was an old N.S.W. League rider, and shook some or
them up in the Goulburn-Sydney and Bathurst-Syd-
ney road races.

They’ve applied wireless telegraphy to the
motor-carj now in U.S.A., and recently, in Indian-
apolis, from a distance of five, miles, a petrol vehicle
was started every five minutes with the wireless
spark. One of the most interesting features of the
experiment was the fact that the operation was
accomplished without the aid of a human hand. A
time switch, installed in connection with the wire-
less outfit, controlled the tests, and from first to
last the starting 1 and stopping were performed auto-
matically.

Item from Bose Bay baths (Sydney) on
Saturday,: 50yds. handicap, final —C. Longworth,
9secl, 1 ; X. Longworth, 2sec., 2; W. Longworth,
scr., 3. Time, 34isec. That’s keeping it in the
family with a vengeance.

A man once big in Australian and Maori-
land football, Harry Francis McCardell, is dead.
At one time he was president of the M.L. Rugby
Union, and bent a lot of his energy to fostering
rivalry between his countrymen and those across
the Tasman. Up to about a year ago he was chief
draughtsman of the Lands Dept., but a throat com-
plaint forced him to retire. When the end came
at Greytown he was 57. Two of his sons are at
the Front. ITis father resides at Sydney.
In order to provide their Caroline “boys’’
with amusement after working hours, the Pacific
Phosphates Co. at Nauru recently got them some
footballs and instructed them in their purpose. For
a time the boys showed great interest, but, later, they
approached the boss in a body and delivered their
ultimatum. If they were expected to do that sort
of thing after knock-off, they declared, the usual
overtime rates would have to be paid!
Miss Muriel Eacott, a champion sprinter
amongst the sex, has retired from the track.
She was one of X. S. Wales’s crack amateur athletes
when she decided to go after the pin-money. Her
first professional race was run last November against
Miss Hazel Meers, whom she beat over the 100yds.
for a £5O nurse. Her best times on the 75yds.
arid 100yds. tracks are 9 l-ssee. and 12 l-ssec. re-
spectively. One hundred yards hurdles she has done
in 16 l-ssec., and in a high jump at Penrith
(N.S.W.) she cleared 4ft. Sin.
The recent performance of the two East
Maitland lads in their all-in endeavor to snatch from
Sydney High School first place in the combined High
School championships—five firsts between them —
pales beside that of a lad at the annual sports of
Bletcliley school (Eng.) recently. He entered for
eight events and won the lot —100yds., 200yds., high
and long jumps, relay race, and throwing the cricket
ball, and was one of the winners of the three-legged
race. It was his busy day.

A Brisbane pressman was sharply re-
minded the other day that this is no time for trifling.
He went out to the place where the Gun Club
conducts a weekly bombardment of pigeons, and was
told that the club had decided, “during the con-
tinuance of the war,” not to supply details of
operations for publication. Now, is this out of
consideration for the pigeon-butchers, the birds or
the Empire ?
“Moana”: The best sport with rod and
line is provided in M.L. by the kingfisli, the most
“sporting” of all sea inhabitants in Australasia. The
best ground is at Russell, in the Bay of Islands,
away north of Auckland. The season lasts from
Christmas until the end of June, and the sport
attracts an increasing number of anglers every year,
many fishermen coming from the Fog and Uncle
Sam land to enjoy it. Specially strong rods -and
tackle have to be used, for every time you hook a
“kingy” you arc in for an hour or two’s rough
sport, and it is always a gamble whether you are
going to get him or he is going to get your valu-
able tackle. He varies in length from two to five
feet, and weighs from 15 to 70 pounds. Last year
the champion catch turned the scale at 721 b.
Besides the sport of catching him there is great
satisfaction in eating him, for he is an excellent
table fish.
* * * *
“Nick Bottom”: “Betlaw” (B. 14/10/T5)
is evidently one of those ardent sportsmen who do
most of their fishing by the fireside, otherwise he
would not talk about using a 10ft. pole to expedite
the capture of a “stingaree.” 1 have fished for them
with the harpoon and the rod and reel, and can
assure my young friend that all he needs to do to
settle the ray is to turn it on its back, when it will
be helpless. In fishing for rays with rod and reel
it is best to use a jag. This saves the time that
would otherwise be wasted in waiting for the skate
to bite, and ensures a longer tussle than if he were
hooked in the orthodox fashion. There is little
sport to be got out of fishing for him with “strong-
shark lines.” That way only requires brute
strength, but it takes an expert angler to land even
a moderate-sized ray with rod and reel. I had a
tussle with one at Currumbin Creek (Q.) which
lasted over an hour, and ended in a victory for Mr.
Ray, who headed for the open sea with a jag and
about 150yds. of valuable gut line.
* * * *
“D.F.” : There must be an enormous mor-
tality amongst the trout which the Fisheries Com-
missioners breed at the hatchery at the Plenty
(Tas.), or all the streams in the State would not
hold them. This year the Commissioners, sold
200,000 eggs to Ballarat and 40,000 to Geelong, and
even then they had well over 1,000,000 for their own

The U.S.A. are enjoying a lawn-tennis boom,
and a big surprise has been sprung on followers of
the game by the sudden brilliancy of a'stripling
named Johnson. In winning the Singles Cham-
pionship of sland he defeated a strong field, includ-
ing all the home Davis Cup players, among them,
of course, being McLoughlin. Johnson is only 20,
so that he probably won’t be too old to play in the
big event when it is once more on the programme
of world tennis.

Let Me Make You Stronger and Healthier
by my perfectly natural and interesting System of
“Health Exercises.”
Every man who wishes to be successful in any
branch of sport where his stamina and staying
powers are tested, should indulge in such exercises
as will strengthen the particular part of his body
where most strain is required.
MY POSTAL SYSTEM
of Physical Culture teaches you the various move-
ments necessary to secure a full and complete relaxa-
tion and contraction of your muscular frame —ex-
ercises which pump sufficient blood into your in-
ternal organs to reach every tiny cell, and maintain
a glowing current of rich red blood throughout
your body.
The internal muscles, and the muscles which are
not generally used, get particular attention. The
aim is to make a steady, all-round improvement
that will be certain to secure better health and better
spirits—more energy and sounder sleep.
Give me fifteen minutes of your time each day,
and I’ll make a different man of you.
Here is what one satisfied pupil says:—
“1 have practised the exercises regularly, and
I can safely say I nev3i* felt as well in my life
as now. I feel thoroughly wound up.”
“A. 0.51..” Miandetta, N.S.W.
Full particulars of my methods and fees are given
in mv booklet, “Health and Strength from Self Cul-
ture,” which will be promptly sent to you if you
will write for it.
Just write your name and address across this. I'll
know what you mean. Send three penny stamps for
postage.

Magnetic Blowout Lightning Arrester
Severe lightning disturbances
are easily discharged by the
Type M.D. Magnetic
Blowout Lightning Arresters
When lightning potential rises
on the line, the spark gap breaks
down, and a discharge occurs
th rough the gap to earth.
Part of the current shunts through
the blowout coil, producing a
strong magnetic field across the
spark gap. The magnetic field
immediately blows out the dis-
charge arc and restores normal
conditions.

HIGHEST AWARDS AT ALL THE GREAT EXHIBITIONS. S
“Stargazer” : So many of those American
plays, like “Nobody’s Widow” and the late,
unlamented “Law of the Land,” are merely
pretty good short stories which the drama-
lists have striven to eke out into three- <>r
four-act dramas by employing the art of the
lead-beater. “Nobody’s Widow” exhausts
all its material in Act 1. The rest is
merely a re-hash of the same mental alti-
tudes, with the result that the audience has
a feeling of being mentally gorged before
the final fall of the curtain. There is
cleverness enough in “Nobody’s Widow” to
make this most regrettable. The central
■ idea, which is over-run and knocked out long
before it reaches centre, is a smart one, t<>
which a Pinero might have given profitable
employment for four acts, and the verbal
cleverness in Avery llop wood’s comedy
would fill a column; but as a play “Nobody’s
Widow” is like a fox hunt would be if you
killed your fox before starting the hunt.
“Oberon”: A swindle that deserves a
knock on the head is that of taking a bio-
scope and a lot of years-old lilms through
the country, and getting people to pay to see
them by advertising them as up-to-date war
pictures. I have lately paid to see alleged
war films, and have been shown the dilapi-
dated remnants of ancient Territorial
manoeuvres in England. If a grocer sells
margarine as putter, or a baker puts off
l llb. of bread as 21b., he is liable to a pen-
alty; and why should the man who sells
entertainment be allowed to vend bogus
wares? This confidence game is becoming
more frequent every day in the Backblocks ;
and the Backblocks haven’t so many spare
bobs that it doesn’t matter whether the law
allows them to be rooked of a few or not.
“S." : At a Melbourne patriotic concert
fhe other night a large Jew, exceedingly well
pleased with himself, was a ton-frequent
item. Said one of two female patrons on
my lefty “I wish he wouldn’t sing through
his nose. "Hush, my dear." was the reply.
"tie is not singing—he is playing tile
bugle.”
Martindale, who wrote “Gamblers
All,” died only a few weeks after the produc-
tion of her play at Wyndham’s Theatre. Lon-
don. Lewis Waller and Madge Titheradgc
filled the leading roles, and Francis Wether-
all, who was in Australia with Asche, was
in the cast. Mrs. Martindale was a daugh-
ter of Charles Young, who wrote “Jim the
Penman.” produced by Harrv St. Maur in
Australia in the late ’Bo’s.
“J.F.H.,” from London
There is another revival of “Hindi© Wakes” at
the Duke of York’s, and, preceding the brilliant
worly of the late Stanley Houghton, a new and
amazing one-actev called “Converts,” written In
Houghton’s chum and collaborator, Harold Brig-
house. A pretty Salv’army lassie has converted a
prizefighter, “Jim of Wigan,” and when the curtain
rises on a room in the barracks, she —Daisy—is dis-
covered keenly interested in her prize. Captain Aspin-
al), .who is after the flower, gets furiously jealous,
and loudly hints that the new convert is a fraud
and a humbug, and never had the terrible pugilistic
past on which he is now peiiitentially priding him
soli'. to bowl the rival and impostor out the
captain brings in another pug, one Simpson, other-
wise “.rile Bermondsey Chicken,” and gets up a
quarrel between the pair. “Fighting Jim” agrees
to take the “Chicken” on provided the latter, if
defeated, will kneel at the penitent’s form. Agreed,
and after a merry mill the “Chicken” is duly knocked
out, goes to the bench and proclaims himself con-
verted. The jealous captain is discomfited, and
Daisy declares her intention of uniting herself for
life to St. James. The V) ah Cry is now hunting
round for a dramatic critic.

comedian J. J. Dallas, who starred in the
"•J.P.’ and “There and Back” on an Aus-
tralian tour a decade ago. Ilis principal
hackers were Aubrey Mailallieu. Fred Cam-
bourne and Florence Lloyd. The last-named
first found Australia in company with Maud
Hobson, Decima Moore. Bradfield, Wood-
house and Kaye. That was in ’95. Dallas
was in the front of many musical comedy
and burlesque successes in the old country,
and his work in the “J.P.” and “There and
Back” made Australians wish for more of
him.
Teresa Carreno. the plump, white-haired,
handsome pianist who did an Australian
lour some six or seven years ago, was lately
heard of from Berlin. The lady had four
successive husbands, one of them being an
Italian named Tagliapietra. Now comes the
news that Carrefio’s son. Giovanni Taglia-
pietra. was lately arrested at Milan as a
suspected German spy. Johnny got off by
promising to clear out of Italy/ During the
Australian tour two or three of Oarreno’s
girls kept her company, one of them also
being a brilliant piano-pounder. Tha,t one
got married, however, while on the tour, and
for a time her ambitions were side-tracked.
Carreno is nowadays a-eitizen of the U.S.A.

These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and all of
us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow over the
lives of many of us women, and while, perhaps, a few the more stoical amongst
us _ can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we may all, with a little
care and foresight,' succeed in preventing the results of worry from being notice-
able in our appearance. To these fortunate few this little chat will, however, be
as interesting and instructive as to those who stand in real need of help in toilet
matters, and may be the means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown
method of retaining, or regaining, that beauty of face and figure which is the birth-
right of every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present,
not generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Wrinkles, and How to Remove them. — VS orry,
late hours, or the passing of old Father Time
may cause those ugly little lines which so
detract from the freshness and charm of a
woman’s face; but the cui - e is always the
same. Feed the tissues beneath the skin, and
massage them with a reliable skin food,
which, while nourishing the fatty (issues,
will not coarsen the skin nor grow hairs upon
the face, as so many inferior creams do. to
remove the wrinkles bathe the face with hot
water, wipe it dry; then, while it is still
warm, smear a little mercolised wax over the
w hole face, carrying it well down on the neck,
and, with the tips of the fingers, rub it gently
into the pores, working in an upward and
outward direction. Wipe off any superfluous
wax, leaving a little on the skin all night.
In the morning wash off with waim water
and Pilenta soap. The use of the wax not
only feeds the skin but removes the dead,
outer cuticle, giving the fresh, young skin
beneath an opportunity to breathe and show
itself.
Beautiful Hair —How to Shampoo.—Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky, depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once in
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing
massage a little pure clive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stall ax granules in a cup of hot water, till a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse, and dry by fanning with a palm fan.
or in the open air, if the weather permits.
Should the hair be naturally very greasy, the
oil massage should be omitted. Stallax can
be bought at any tdiemist’s in .quarter-pound
sealed packages; it keeps indefinitely, and one
one package contains sufficient for twenty-five
or thirty shampoos.
The Question of Powder. —Powder should
never be used by anyone with a tendency to
wrinkle, for it fills up the lines on the face,
and tends to deepen and accentuate the wrin-
kles. In the place of powder, get about one
ounce of cleminite from any chemist, and dis-
solve it in four tablespoons of warm water.
Place it in a bottle, and apply to the skin with
the finger tips, allowing it to dry on the face.
This gives the skin a soft, peach-like bloom,
and prevents that unbecoming, greasy appear-
ance which is the bane of many a woman’s
life.
A Tonic for the Hair.—During the spring and
early summer, the hair generally needs a little
stimulant to its growth, in the form of a
tonic. To make a simple and inexpensive one.
at home, take four ounces of bay rum, and
add to it one ounce of boranium. Shake thor-
oughly, and leave for thirty minutes, then
strain, and add sufficient water to make half
a pint. At night, massage the scalp for ten
uinutes, then dab the mixture into the roots
with a soft sponge. Five minutes’ brushing
in the morning will be found* beneficial in giv-
ing- an added gloss to tlie hair
To Wave the Hair.—Hot irons, when employed
to wave the hair, not only make it harsh and
brittle, spoiling color of fair or auburn hair,
but induce a tendency towards greyness. To
give a wave to straight hair, damp it with
silmerine and either plait, tying the ends, or
arrange in waving pins for a short time. A
couple of ounces w ill last quite a long time.
A Greasy Skin and Blackheads. —Blackheads
are absolutely fatal to beauty, for they give a
coarse, dirty look to the face which no cos-
metics can ever hide. The way to remove
blackheads quickly and effectively has only
recently been discovered. For many years
those who suffered in this way were restricted
in their diet, denied sweets, and had to suffer
other privations. Modern science has, how-
ever. provided a simple, effective and quick
remedy. Dissolve one stymol tablet in a glass
of hot water, and when the effervescence lias
subsided, dip a small, soft sponge into the
liquid, and bathe the face. Leave for a few
minutes, then dry with a towel, and the black-
heads will come off. For a greasy skin, bathe
the face three times a week with stymol, and
spray with cold water every morning, using a
vulcanite throat spray.
To Reduce the Figure.—With the present
fashions, even more than with the tight skirts,
it is imperative that the woman who wishes to
look smart should be slim. To reduce one's
weight without injuring one’s health is no
easy matter, and can only be done by taking
some specific which will counteract the natural
tendency towards putting on flesh. A few
elynol berries, eaten regularly, will speedily
transform the fat, ungainly figure into one of
slim and graceful proportions, without any in-
convenience whatever, and in a very short
time. Cl.vnol berries are quite pleasant to the
taste, having a marked peppermint flavor.
To Restore Grey Hair to its Original Color. —
Streaks of grey, whether in fair or dark hair,
are always unbecoming, and prove a cruel tell
tale of age. It is not generally known that
an ounce of tammalite, which can be bought
at any chemist’s, mixed with four ounces oi
bay rum, makes a most satisfactory lotion for
restoring grey hair to its natural color. Apply
the lotion night and morning with a soft
toothbrush, and, after a few days, the hair
will lie found to be gradually returning to its
original shade.
Superfluous Hair —its Cause and Cure. —Super-
fluous hair is invariably the result of using
inferior soap or bad face creams. To remove
the hairs, apply a little powdered pheminol
mixed to a paste with cold water and applied
to the skin with a bone knife. The skin
should be dusted with powdered alum before
applying the pheminol. and the paste removed
after being left on for two minutes. This
treatment is recommended not only to remove
the growth temporarily, but to eventually kill
the roots. [2

HIGH day and holiday shoes, for wear on
extra-special occasions with the extra-
special gown, ought,. one feels, to have
something distinctive about them, some-
thing that lifts them above the shoes for every-
day wear and tear. It is this distinctive, this
different look, that makes the charm of the most
elegant shoes in the Bostock range, the delightful
little black satin shoe here illustrated,, for ex-
ample. One has only to glance at the picture to see
that here is something very smart and desirable.
Then think of it on, showing daintily, captivat-
-5 ugly, beneath the flounced or scalloped hem of
the summer gown. Nothing could be more appro-
priate or more charming. And with all its
daintiness and piquancy, it is the most comfortable
and well-fitting of shoes, as indeed are all those
short-fronted styles, and will suit most women,
giving that ease, lightness and coolness which the
Australian climate requires.

W.H.L.: Know nothing of it beyond that
the shares are not publicly quoted in Sydney....
8.M.K.: Don’t depend on it. Its position is entirely
unsatisfactory Raggs: Very much obliged. We're
always looking for that intimate kind of personal
par. .. .Hardface: Just drop a line to Hughes,
Attorney-General. He’s on the look-out for people
of. that sort. .. . J.S.McI.: The B. never gives advice
re speculations; but the mine is one of the best.
For the rest, many thanks... .Overlander: Now dig
out some more. . . .11. G.: “On the square” surged in
with a dozen other beer poems, and was drowned.
It had bad luck.... Sciatica: Don't know the firm,
and don’t want to know it while there are reputable
qualified doetors about. .. .O.J. tN.S.W.) : Too slight
and unskilful. .. .W.H.P.M.: Don't know the school
you mention. Your best plan would be to get in
touch with a local man. The long-distance tuition
is a gamble....M. Scott S.: Afraid neither will
suit. .. . Jimo: Not very bright.... Dick the N.:
You can't be made or marred with that item. . . .
11.H.W.: Have you heard any soldiers talking like
that? We haven't. .. .11. P.: Doesn't ring true and
it's uneven.... S.S. ((}.): Not enough technical
skill. .. .Norseman: Boom for a bush poetess!
J.D. (Q.) : “After the war.” “After the war”!
Where have we heard that phrase before?
... ... J.C.M.: But Australia isn’t talking like that.
Some of the papers and politicians may be, but
they’re not Australia. .. .M.H.L.: Isn’t it a bit late
to exult over Gaba Tepe—or Gaba Anything Else?
. ...E.M.E. (Q.) : Glad to hear you're not down-
hearted. You’ve a long way to go. This last one
can be classed as just verse. . . .Tom T.: What deputy-
superintendent is this you're cursing so roundly. . . .
Bluchy: Well enough done, but not what we want.
You might, place it with the Sunday paper indi-
cated... .Lily M.: Sincere work, but it's such an old
theme that finer treatment is required.... Learner:
Sorry, but we've got to return the batch. .. .P.N.:
Can't cash it. Sure the Kaiser doesn't talk like
that....C.J. (N.S.W.) : “Gallipoli” is a gallant and
respectable failure. Good try for a trumpet
blast. . . .S.E. (M.L.) : Both beaten on points. . . .W.W.
(Y.) : Not the sort of stuff we could use. It’s not
even good of its kind... .T.K.S.: The Religious Edi-
tor (he read and judged it by candlelight in The
Bulletin’s oratory after vespers) says the tone is
too irreverent. .. .H.G.11.: Confidential report of pro-
ceedings at Devil’s tea-party isn’t as thrilling as
we expected... .J.H.S.: More Devil verse without
any devil in it!. . . .L.R.F.: Nothing there for us. .. .
M.A.S.: You score a good try. First verse sets a
standard that the others fail to reach. .. .C.N.J.:
“Only an ordinary soldier”—but not so ordinary
as the rhyme. .. .J.F.W.: Not all the artillery of
the Allies will make “Dardanelles” rhyme with
“fell”.. . . Alf S.: Answering Lissauer’s Chant of
Hate at this hour! Well, there is one thing to be
said for you—you’re not impetuous. .. .Jose Le V.:
If the tremendous document is a proclamation it is
a dull one, and interests us less than the absurd
winged insect which is spinning on its head as
these lines are written. .. .E.H.: (M.L.) : If we’d
chucked it up when we failed first time, oh where
would we be who prose and rhyme? The first
attempts to build cathedrals and ships and piecrust
and poems were probably dismal failures. But
somebody kept pegging away, and now we have
all these things. .. .F.L.G.: No reason why you
shouldn’t continue. .. .No. 983: We are saving up
your verses for a streaming wet day, when the wind
is blowing a gale from the south-east. Verses read
under the wrong weather conditions are worse than
useless. Only the north-easter poems are being read
to-day. .. .Cypress: It is dead easy to groan and go
sour and see no good in man or beast. We’re buying
as much optimism as we can get these times. . . .
Tyrol: That’s not the point. The B. certainly
doesn’t want to convey any information to the enemy.
Whenever any information which might at all con-
ceivably be of value to him has been put into type,
The B. at any rate has been obliged to the Censor
for drawing attention to it. But this paper protests
strongly (and so would the public if it knew)
against the censoring of statements directed to prove
wicked local muddling and worse —-in connection
with certain political appointments, for instance.
It is this censoring that helps the enemy, by leading
to the little less than murder of our own sons and
brothers.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.P.S.: The faces lack expression. The people are
supposed to be interested in the conversation they
are carrying on, yet they are not looking at each
other. They are not even looking at the same object.
Also, the young man’s hair has been cruelly
mangled by his barber. .. .Norman O.: Not enough
in the gag. Drawing creditable for 14, but it’s a
long way from print... .R.T.: Very p00r....C.
Sherwood: It won’t d 0... .C.C. (V.) : Can’t use any
of them... .E.W.P.: Where did you get your shaggy
cowmen and the ass in riding breeches?
“F.II.”: The comparative plainness of
woman’s present dressing (when she dresses
right) has driven fashion writers to give
more attention to Society’s feet; and the
shortness of the skirts permits them to be
examined in detail. In the race-course
costume of one missus “an effective
note was. introduced by higli white
boots fastened down the front with
tan lacings.” Another of the same
wore “well-cut boots to match a very smart
costume of biscuit peau de sole.” The wife
of a bookmaker was reported in something
really slambang—“high boots with duck-
yellow tops and heels”: while a miss on
whose part “it was not considered shocking
just to show a bit of stocking,” like the
original Gaiety Girl, was reported accord-
ingly : “Biscuit stockings and black shoes” —
nothing else. We live in a progressive age,
boys, and no doubt the time is approaching
when Birdie will decide to come forward in
King Charles top-boots and a pair of pink
silks —with a skirt designed specially to ad-
vertise the silks.
’TWAS BUT A DREME.
I had a dreme, a happy dreme,
We rowed upon a lake;
You filled my arms with lilies fair
And vowed that for my sake,
You’d give up cards and smoking, dear,
And lead a noble life;
You placed pond lilies in my lmir
And I would he your wife.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, bur are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten

A WONDERFUL FLESH BUILDER
FOR THIN PEOPLE.
It is generally admitted that the forma-
tion of flesh depends largely upon the power
of assimilation, and. all physicians agree
that people who assimilate their fooct pro-
perly are always well and firmly developed
without being excessively fat. If everyone
possessed perfect assimilation, there tvould
be no thin, scraggy men or it
is extremely interesting to note that speci-
alists are now advising the use of a highly
concentrated food product known as Phor-
moid, which possesses remarkable proper-
ties for strengthening the nerve tissues and
increasing the power of assimilation, thus
making"it possible 'for the thinnest of . men
-or women, to’put on flesh Jn the most! rapid
manner. ...Being supplied.ln tablets (which
may be eaten like a wafer) it is very plea-
sant and easy to take, and undoubtedly the
most effective..and inexpensive method of
increasing one’s weight and improving one’s
appearance.
Caution to Ladies. —Thin, ladies, who
object to an increased bust- ‘flevd-bpment
should not take Phormoid, as it generally
develops the bust from three to- four inches
in: a . few weeks,* ..." '
IN
BANANA LAND
It is refreshing to note that the Kaiser
Bill crushing on the Oaks goldfield (N.Q.)
resulted in only £7 worth from nine tons.
Queensland Railway Department, weary of
patching and poisoning its wooden hutches,
is now building its stations of concrete. And
the white ant of N.Q., who. is half an inch
long and regards an ironbark sleeper as
breakfast pap, is wailing “Ichabod ! These
Labor Governments again I”
Sydney B. J. Skertchley, of Corinda,
reckons he originated the gigantic net-device
that is, according to the cables, protecting
the troopships in certain waters in
Europe. At all events, Skertchley and a
friend sent in the suggestion, with particu-
lars, to the British War Office 15 months
ago, and received the thanks of the War Gods
two days later.
“Pare” : This devastating climate of ours !
A man and his wife, living out West, where
the summer heat on a cool verandah is
112 deg., applied for an old-age pension. It
was too plainly a premature proceeding, for
one is a mere 78 and the other but 71. Uf
course, Red Tape scented the brazen pro-
ceeding ; setting to work, it discovered that
the young fellow was able to earn 85s. a
week at. a blacksmith’s forge, and told him
to keep on doing it.
The A. J. Jones spoken of as likely to be
the nominee of Labor for Fisher’s seat at
Wide Bay is member for Maryborough iu the
►State Assembly. He lias been in Parlia-
meu only a few months, and has so far not
set the premises on fire. Either B. 11.
Corser or C. J. Booker may carry the Oppo-
sition standard. Corser is a young man who
beat Jones in Burnett at the previous general
election. Booker, who has . sat for Wide
Bay in the State Parliament, suffers from
parochialism in a bad form, and if it really
did its job a National Parliament would be a
torture chamber for him.
Two men from the Front lauded back .at
Maryborough recently. One was a Parson
and the other just a Bloke. The Parson
explained that “lie was not breaking his neck
to get back there; and any man who said he
wanted to go back was a: bit touched.” The
Bloke (Private Jerry Tamblyn) was too
busy to make a speech. While a reporter ran
beside him he remarked that he was off back
to Brisbane to be medically examined to see
if he could hook it to the trenches again. If
he was turned down he had his application
ready for a place with the Ambulance Corps
to succor wounded mates. ~ Then he hopped
on the mail train and was gone in a cloud of
dust.
“Itan”: Ex-parson Brentnall, of the
Bananaland House of Fossils, and the biggest
shareholder in the anti-Federal, Freetrade
Telegraph, has warned the Ryan Govern-
ment, owing to its threats against the
Doomed Chamber, that “it had better look
out.” It is not quite clear what Brentnall
means, but it recalls a bit of history. Long-
ago there was a fighting parson in Brisbane
named Buchanan, who betrayed symptoms of
the democratic foi’ce which was coming.
On a public platform with Buchanan and
others Brentnall argued that he had a right
to do what he thought fit with his own
property. Buchanan dissented in a sharp
interjection. “What,” roared Brentnall,
“can’t I do what I like wifh my own'?”
“No,” exclaimed Buchanan, “you can’t
smother me with your ovei’coat!” Brentnall,
in an octogenarian delusion, now thinks he
can do something desperate with his political
overcoat. But the Labor Government will
take a lot of smothering.
“Ellerslie” i These times, in Brisbane any-
way, a man’s credit is judged by galvanised
iron—that . is, among hardware dealers.
When a firm rings up another with a query
about opening aii account with Smithson
it may be told, “Well, we don’t know much
about him —we don’t give him credit for
galvanised iron,” or “He’s all right—we let
him have galvanised iron.” That tells
straight away Smithson’s financial stand-
ing. Galvanised iron ,is a scarce commo-
dity nowadays, for many reasons; the two
chief ones being that a huge quantity has
been used for military purposes in Australia
and-Europe, and that as Australia (and
Britain, too) allowed Germany to collar the
spelter trade, local firm's cannot manufac-
ture nearly enough. Most of our gal-
vanised iron comes from America l ' ndw.
Firms have to buy tlie precious ■ stuff
Ifor 'cash, - and naturally will sell only
[for cash—-unless the customer is Al.
(So if you have any doubts about your
credit ring up and ask for galvanised iron
on tick.
Young of Yeronga, a signaller
at the Front, tells a “humorous incident” of
the Gallipoli trenches
Will was fixing a sandbag on the parapet
when a bomb was dropped in by the Turks. He
dropped the bag to smother it, but overbalanced
and came down sitting on the bag. He was blown
several feet and cannoned into a lieutenant’s head
with his jaw. He was unhurt, but the lieutenant’s
jaw was broken.
The lieutenant hasn’t been beard from. Per-
haps he is still looking for the humor of the
business.
Dave Bowman, who has been anti-liquor
all his -life, is in his old age going to start
in the pub-keeping line himself. Like a
sensible man tlie Home Sec. realises that
it isn't the pub that does the damage—it’s
the' ba.d pub. The good pub is a conveni-
ence, and if it stayed open all tlie 24 hours
it would be a greater convenience than if
it stayed 'open only six hours —just as it is
with a chemist’s shop. But the bad pub is
a curse; and early-closing schemes are all
based .on the idea of limiting the curse.
Bowman intends to start his first State pub
at Mount Cuthbert, on Cloncurry; and it
rests very largely witli the employees to
decide whether the system shall be extended
or not.
A BAD SHOT.
FIRST BYSTANDER: “Has he "been knocked down?”
SECOND DITTO: “Well, no. He went ter lean against the Town Hall an’ missed it.”

“Myall’s” send-off: —-
Frank B. Bays, one of the early pioneers of the
Maranoa district, has just forded the river. It- was
in ’62 that Bays first boiled fhs cfbart on the banks
of the Balpnne, on the' spot Surat
now stands. He ’ did the long trip overland from
Ipswich with a bullock waggon, and laid the founda-
tion of a thriving business beneath the canvas shelter
of a tent on the bank of the stream. .He was.a piere
irresponsible youth of 86 when be left behind 'Kim a
widow and a name known and respected from the
Border to the 'Reach. <
Bananaland makes a certain allowance to
foster mothers for each child supported, and
a smaller allowance to natural mothers who
are widows and without means. The Ryan
Government has, however, just made the
natural motherV alldwtince equal to the
foster mother’s, on the ground that she is
just as deserving. Noiv the point is raised
that the Jbster-mother’s remuneration should
be lifted still further, inasmuch as it is a
more meritorious thing to bring up other
people’s children, than it is to bring up your
own. If the natural mothers are wise they
will lie low until the foster mothers carry
their point, and then agitate for a second
equalisation. After that the foster mothers
can come and score again, and so the game
may go on. There’s money for anybody
with a likely-looking vote in Queensland just
now.
Brisbane Daily Mail has had another
change in its career. Wren has re-called
Cyrus Macfarlane to the chair. With Mac-
farlane editor of the Mail, Macdonald editor
of the Standard, and Macgregor chief leader-
writer on the Tory Courier, Brisbane jour-
nalism looks as if it is going to the clans.
Queensland’s latest strike is in the
Supreme Gourt K of all places, and the man
who has called+himself out and picketed him-
self is the Chief Justice,' of all people. His
Honor Pope Cooper suspects, in plain lan-
guage, that the Executive has been monkey-
ing with the sentences of the Court: and lie
declares that he won’t sentence another per-
son to.gaol until the whole matter is cleared
up i So when a prisoner is either found
guiltklor pleads guilty Pope Cooper is merely
renicftfding him. This paper doesn’t - know
the facts of the prese’nt case; v but if there
has been monkeying with sentences, the
Chief Justice couldn’t easily take too strong'
measures to expose the scandal. And it is
to he hoped the flaw^won’t be merely plas-
tered The wlidle system needs altering
—the system under which sentences are re-
viewed, not by Judges who are beyond the
influence of votes, but by politicians whose
hold on office depends upon the number of
people they can make their friends.
The Government proposed to. make - the
new workmen’s compensation insurance a
State'monopoly ; ..and the fegislative Council
has blocked it “in the interests of Private
Enterprise.” The House is penalising Pri-
vate Enterprise, not assisting it. Insur-
ance under the Miners’ Accident' Relief Fund
Act in N. S. Wales is a so-called Govern-
ment monopoly. Being a '-Government
monopoly it isn’t necessary to employ an
army of canvassers and collectors, so the
expenses runlto only about 5 per cent. Now
what sort of a row would there be If it was
proposed to abolish the present system in
N. S. Wales and let 50 private cos. loose V
Every mineowner in N. S. Wales would
suffer, because every one of them would have
to pay his whack of the cost of the entirely
unnecessary army of canvassers and collec-
tors and., inspectors and agency supervisors.
The Leg. Council is at bay now, with a
referendum on the question of its existence
yawning behind and a list of rejected Bills
staring in its face. It. was not until the
Uppercut Chamber had mutilated the
Workers’ Compensation Bill, the Accommoda-
tion Bill and the Sewerage Workers Bill,
and had twice amended the Meatworks Bill,
that Ryan asked for leave to introduce a
measure to remove the excrescence from the
landscape. It is either an anomaly or a
redundancy.. It is an- anomaly if it says
No when the people’s direct representatives
have said Yes. And it is a redundancy if
it says Yes to the people’s Yes. In either
case it has no place in a Democracy which
wants to do things as economically as pos-
sible. .
Professor Skertchley, who soon after the
war started proposed submerged nets to
secure the safety of troopships from sub-
marines, and got the prompt thanks of the
War Office, is a versatile scientist. His
bread-and-butter specialty is geology, but. he
is also examiner and chief authority in
Bananaland, on optics, has studied anthro-
pology in South America, Borneo and a few
other outlandish places, and can talk about
derivation of national types for a‘ week.
The Ryan Government is going into re-
tail business. In a week or so the State will
put on the butcher’s apron and conduct a
strictly cash, no-delivery meat business in
Roma-street, Brisbane, in part of the pre-
mises used by the Railway Department’s
Cold Stores. It will thus have the meat—
it is proposed only to sell the frozen article
—on tap, as it were. Just at present
Queensland does not? know exactly where it
is in regard to its meat supplies; and the
Government’s move is not so much to
cheapen prices as to prevent them going
higher, as they threaten to do. ’ •
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 30, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii, —
I think I told you last week that our Ex.
was so busy he had not been to a picture
show. He lias now. To-night lie, Cdlmiel
Lee arid a few others dropped into ■ the
Lyceum to encourage a recruiting frith.
Other patriotic efforts have kept him on
the move, and. in addition, he opened Mr.
Wadliam’s ; s |allery of paintings; Part of
this collection is from the artist’s own brush,
and part is the work of well-known English
color-men.*
“Turning from the arts of peace to the
curse of war his Ex. visited Ipswich work-
shops, and after being shown how to make
munitions he had lunch with the men, arid
urged on them the gravity of their work.
The Arts and Crafts held a,sale of work
on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this
week, in aid of the Wounded Soldiers’
Fund. .Bishop Lti^J&sScP;;Resided at the
opening, and all the members gave gener-
ously of their best —and marked their gifts
at low prices. This inducement resulted in
nearly everything being bought up bye the
second day, and scSuts had to be sent hot-
foot to rake in another supply. •,
Killed in action, Lt. A. V. Auchterloriie,
the eldest of the three brothers-mentioned
in a recent Bulletin as having departed
for the testing place of men. He was with
a. machine-gun section.
Three other deaths this week. One was
that of Richard Edwards, formerly M.H.R.,
a founder of the firm of Edwards and
Chapman, and a director of the Telegraph
newspaper. He will be missed. Another
who crossed over was Lindsay Deuchar.
manager of the Commercial Bank of Aus-
tralia. His only son died of wounds at
Gallipoli, and though the father held his
head bravely the blow killed him. T. G.
Millar, also gone, was once a well-known
pastoralist in Central Queensland.'
Corporal A. E. B. Beresford, of the 9th
Battalion, who has been convalescing in
England, has become engaged. His partner
is Miss E. M. Lavingtou, of Cheatham,
London.
Miss Minnie Cook, daughter of Mrs. Cook,
of Rockhampton, and of the late squatter
Cook, of Central Queensland, changed -her
name to Mahoney on Tuesday, Her brother-
in-law, Premier Ryan, gave her 'away, and
the wedding breakfast was eaten at the
Ryan homestead. Mr. and Mrs. Mahoney
are honeymooning in Melbourne, to which
city the Premier and Mrs.' Ryan also fled
to-day.
During the week Mrs. Ryan went up to
Toowoomba and crowned Mrs. R. Stewart
“Queen” of the local patriotic day. The
ceremony took place in the Empire Theatre.
Two fluttersome meetings under the
leadership of the Mayoress filled the Town
Hall this week, to worry about the pro-
posed inclusion of domestics in the Workers’
Compensation Act. Those who attended,
though heated, didn’t seem to be too well
acquainted with the subject; but'the scheme
as far as it teas understood was looked
upon as being a Dangerous Innovation.
The Christmas cheer fund got three lifts
this week, two from concerts and one from
Copper Day, which was helped along,
amongst an army of others, by Lizette
Parkes. I won’t tell you how much we
raised, so that envy be stilled and peace be
within our own Borders, but it was some-
thing handsome.
Before he went off to the war, this Bris-
bane volunteer yielded to the pressure of the
girl and gave her his money to keep, well
on to the four-figure mark. She made no
special promise of holding aloof from matri-
mony, though he felt he had sealed the bar-
gain with his confidence. Others-‘ got to
know of the damsel’s good luck, -and there
are already three mean bidders for the girl
and the money that is left; but honors are
so far easy. What will happen in the by-
and-bye is -not too clear, but the return of
the young man will make a dust. If a Ger-
man bullet settles that difficulty it will be
a case of the Devil caring for his own. But
sometimes Satan is cantankerous.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
It is out at last. The money in the Aus-
tralian Meat Works, on the Brisbane River,
which cost three-quarters of a million, was
provided by. six members of the Swift
family. Solicitor Thynne, embarrassed by
the suggestion in the Chamber of Death that
there was German money in the concern,
explained \yho his principals were. Hitherto
the matter was shrouded in mystery, mainly
because the first registered shareholders were
half a dozen clerks in Thynne’s office. Still
the explanation does not wholly clear the
air, as doubt still attaches to the destina-
tion,of some of last year’s shipments of meat.

SYMPTOMS OF DEBILITY.
People who are tired all of the time and
never feel rested even after a long night in
bed, who cannot regain weight and strength,
whose step lacks elasticity and who feel no
joy in living are debilitated.
A medical examination might easily show
that every organ of the body is acting nor-
mally. but the pallor of the face will usually
show that the blood is thin. This is the root
of the trouble.
Debility is a loss of vitality, not affecting
>ny one'part of the body, but the system
generally. The blood goes to every part of
the body and the use of a blood tonic like
Dr. W illiams’ Pink Pills quickly tones up
the system. The first sign of returning health
is a better appetite, improved digestion, a
quicker step, brighter eyes, better color in
the cheeks. The rich, red blood, reaching
every organ and muscle, carries renewed
health and vigor. The nerves are quieted,
sleep becomes more refreshing and with per-
sistent treatment and proper living the de-
bilitated patient is once more enabled to
enjoy life.
Two useful books, “Building Up the Blood”
and “What to Eat,” will be sent free on
request by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
Sydney. Your own chemist sells Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills.*
AN AFTER-DINNER PILL.
Most people eat too much. If you are a
hearty eater, help your digestion, take care
of the over-load by taking one Pinkette, the
little sugar-coated laxative ovals after a big
dinner. I’inkettes gently stimulate the
stomach, prevent congestion arid the many
distressing results of overnndulgence at the
table.
Pinkettes, the new laxative, Jire greatly
superior to old-fashioned medicines which
over-stimulate the liver and, when their use
is. stopped, leave it more torpid than before.
Pinkettes do not upset the stomach or cause
griping.
Pinkettes should be in every household.
Do not wait until you need to take them ;
buy a bottle now. If your chemist cannot
supply you send Is. to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Sydney, for a full-sized bottle ;
or send your name and address? mentioning
The Bulletin, and a free sample will be
sent to you.* ;
ALL AUSTRALIANS visiting London
should read the British' Austral-
asian, 6d. weekly—an illustrated paper
containing mail and cable news from Aus-
tralia, and news of Australians in Europe
and at home. Australians are cordially in-
vited to visit the British Australasian
Reading Room at the Offices, 115 High Hol-
born, London, W.C., where they can see the
home papers, meet their friends, use the
telephone, and obtain information without

By “ JCat-ar'ah” Treatment
the Hose and Throat are
treated effectively with
Medicated Oxy&en inhaled
direct to the afflicted mem>
branes.
“ Kat-ar*ah 1 ' Treatment
has a direct influence upon
the catarrhal poisons of
the body and conquers the
disease by removing the
cause.
Ate You a Victim of
CATARRH!
You know what Catarrh is, with its humiliating and discomfort-
ing symptoms.
A slight cold develops into a stubborn and protracted one, while
the discharges from the nose are most offensive and annoying.
As the inflammation extends further up into the head and the
delicate mechanism of the ear is attacked, there is a continual
buzzing and ringing in the ears, and frequently the hearing is
partially or totally lost. Headaches are almost constant, with
sometimes acute pains in the eyes, and the nose becomes so
plugged up that the patient must breathe through the mouth,
while the slimy secretions are forced back into the throat,
requiring almost continual hawking and spitting to dislodge them.
At certain stages of the disease the odor of the breath becomes
very bad, to the mortification and embarrassment of the sufferers,
and the disgust of all who come near them. Gradually the
mucous, discharge finds its way into the internal organs, and a
most miserable form of Dyspepsia, or Catarrh of the Stomach, is
the inevitable consequence. The blood becomes contaminated by
catarrhal poisons and unhealthy matter, and these are
distributed through the body.
Catarrh is then a deep-seated, dangerous, constitutional or
Bystemic disease, and its effect upon the general health and
system is soon apparent—appetite and strength are gone, weight
is lost, despondency takes the place of confidence, and the disease
frequently settles in some vital organ or terminates in Bronchitis,
Asthma, Neuritis, or dread Consumption.
Trial Bottle of
"Kat-ar-oli" Inhalant
FREE.
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to try a sample bottle of “Kat-
ar-ah ” Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic compound of certain
valuable medicaments, and is supremely beneficial in xts influence on the
mucous membrane. It has a distinctly soothing, healing and aero-sanative
effect, sufficient to disintegrate and dislodge the slimy mucous accumulations.
“Kat-ar-ah” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing effects are
simply marvellous. You can notice an improvement immediately after
beginning its use. It quickly takes up its work of killing the disease
germs, of minimising and eventually stopping the discomforting mucous
discharges in .he nose and throat —mucous that is finding its way into
your stomach and poisoning your system.
X will supply you with a Trial Bottle of “Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant FREE OF
CHARGE, if you will send me your full name and address, together with
3d. in stamps to cover cost of postage. Write address plainly, state
whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss, and be sure to mention this paper. Send
for your bottle NOW.

If any illustration appearing in The
Bulletin takes your fancy, write to the
Manager, vho will quote you pr:?e for it.
Private David Crosby, a Queenslander,
made the following remarkable collection of
casualties during a three hours’ tight at
Gallipoli: A bayonet wound 18 inches long
in the abdomen; shot through the groin;
shot through the right elbow; broken
wrist; a broken finger; fractured knee; a
bullet in the chest (it can easily be fin-
gered) ; and a bullet in the liver. After
getting this lot he lay on the battlefield for
28 hours, and was finally dragged to shelter
by a man who was badly wounded himself.
At latest advices Crosby was in hospital at
Liverpool, about to undergo a couple of
operations to get the lead out of the system
and (so marvellous is the recuperative
powers of these clean and thoroughly fit
fellows) expecting to be all right again in
a few weeks.
“Koreki,” from Cloneurry :—
Times have changed since “E.J.C.’s” cry (B
80/9/ 15) about the wretched conditions of north-
west Queensland towns had any justification. His
friends who have a sponge-down once a month must
be immigrants from Whitechapel. The mines have
each a bathroom with ample condensed water, and
the hotel accommodation is as good as anywhere in
the back country of Queensland. Also, after being
heie (Friezland) for two years, 1 can safely say
that I have not heard anyone complaining of Nor-
folk Howards or any of their relations. As for
di unken brawls, the records of the police court will
testify to their absence. If a scrap does occur it is
the subject of conversation for a week and is dished
up in a column in the local rag. The Y.M.C.A. has
no occasion to come up and start in opposition to
the existing amusements. There are' plenty in the
business already. Dancing is the mania of the dis-
trict, and every week the place has four picture per-
formances. There is also a public reading-room well
supplied with the world’s papers and magazines; and
there is a circulating library of aboyMsso 'volumes
subscription, 2s. 6d. per quarter.- 4 "The majority of
men are young, and know the valu\ of money, and
save it and presently use it to marry or go where
booze is good: and cheap. Now, will “K. J C ” apolo-
gise to the North-West?
“The Old '(Soldier’s” despatch
In my present youth I am living in an establish-
ment, run by the Salv’army near Sydney, for the
purpose of lodging young fellows of 80. like myself
strictly at our own expense. The cost to guests
oscillates between 8s. and 15s. a week. Those who
pay 8s. or 10s. sleep in dormitories containing 10
beds each. An attempt is made to subject these
inmates to something like barrack-room discipline;
but it is more or less a failure. For instance’
smoking m the dormitories is 'Strictly forbidden;
but everyone smokes, and pipes are alight all night,
r ie worst feature is that there is no medical man
living- within some miles of the establishment. One
\isited us on a day last week, and went round in a
perfunctory manner, but there was no offer to
allow anyone who wanted medical attendance to have
it. In fact, there is no attempt to meet the contin-
of one of these old men becoming suddenly
ill. There are no medicines in the establishment, and
no one on the premises competent to administer them
if there were. One would think that the Army
would at least keep a trained nurse on the staff in
order to- avert the worst consequences of sudden
illness, and. prevent it running its course before help
could be summoned. There is certainly one person
on the premises who has had some experience in
dispensing, and knows the properties of drugs, but
he has very little authority, and, in any case, he has
no drugs or stimulants to administer and no dress-
ings to apply in case of accidental injury. If a
boarder fell downstairs and fractured his neck, all
the dispenser could offer in the way of comfort
would be a chapter or two from the Book of Job.
And you know what sort of comfort Job got.
Milo ’: Tyson at his death might have
been a Sugar King as well as a Cattle King
but for a small circumstance that dropped in
the way. He took up a large area of coun-
try, much of it first-class sugar land, at
Cardwell, and planted about 100 acres with
cane. But the crop was never cut. He had
carried his intention of building a sugar-mill
to the point of landing a large quantity of
bricks on the ground, but just then the
Government proposed some sharp modifica-
tions in the system of employing Pacific
Islanders in the fields, and Tyson threw up
the whole business. Had he not done so it
is certain that the excellent sugar land about
Cardwell and on the Tally River and Liver-
pool Creek would now be extensive cane-
fields instead of being practically waste land,
with a struggling settler here and there.
The Chow, however, is to the rescue, and is
preparing the way for future settlement.
One of him this year has made as much as
£800 a month from his banana plantation,
and is going strong in the direction of
becoming the Banana King of Queensland.
Tyson’s bricks are still on the ground, and
each year his cane crop asserts itself, only
to be eaten down by stock.
“O K.” : The bright young spinster whom
Melbourne knew as Marjorie Btrinfiockel has
bad a terrible fall out with her, good luck
in London. Two or three years ago she
went to England to make her fortune, and
she made it. She got among the “smart”
people and achieved a husband, Norman
Raphael, whom she had met in Melbourne
when he was doing a globe-trot. Her
fiance’s father was understood to be a mil-
lionaire,. more or less. Her fiance’s favorite
uncle- was even more of a millionaire, and
Marjorie’s wedding attracted the beau
monde of Jerusalem. She went on doing
well. Her gowns, her epigrams and her
high spirits made her popular. Then the
war came and her husband enlisted and the
home was broken up; after which nothing
more was heard of Marjorie until the cable
announced her arrest on two charges which
indicated that the Raphael family had
turned its nose upon her. She was accused
of getting false credit at an expensive hotel
where she had enjoyed life for some months,
and of getting £500 worth of jewellery on
tick for pawning purposes, the proceeds
going to pay a dressmaker’s bill. Marjorie
was not even bailed out—not in the first
instance, anyhow. She had to go to prison,
and was served with divorce papers whilst
moping in the dungeon cell. But when she
' was tried at the Old Bailey for her crimes
the jury decided without leaving the box
that she had committed no crimes at all
This acquittal looks very like a costlv ex-
perience for somebody else. If a Raphael
paid the piper, Marjorie has good ground
tor an action; and when her little tootsies
are on firm ground she is not the sort of
young woman to do nothing.

Edison’s Masterpiece:
the Diamond Disc Phonograph.
How Musicians regard it.
One of the most striking testimonies as to the beauty of the
Edison Diamond Disc Phonograph, comes from the fact of its
being highly praised by world-famed musicians.
Not long ago a certain musician of note, after carefully exam-
ining and intently listening to this new Edison Phonograph,
enthusiastically exclaimed: “You do not know what you have.
You call it the greatest talking-machine in the world. Yes, it
is that, but it is more; it is the greatest MUSICAL INSTRU-
MENT in the world. It' means more to music than anything
that has ever happened before.”
Here are some of the advantages which caused the musician
to make that remark. Edison Diamond Point Reproducers
supplant the troublesome, unsatisfactory needles of other disc
machines; the Diamond Point never wears, and the record
itself remains unimpaired. All scratchy noises are entirely
eliminated. Every overtone is reproduced—and these over-
tones alone give quality to music.
The Edison Diamond Disc Phonograph appeals specially to
music-loving people, for it reproduces the original music
exactly as played or sung, in proper pitch and with a delight-
fully sweet, clear tone.
You must hear it to appreciate it.

write direct to us for descriptive catalog, post free.

“Bag”: Some of the sheepskin waistcoats
which are being sent to soldiers are liable to
do more harm than good. Instead of having
thong fastenings they are fitted with large
metal buckles. A bullet hitting one of these
duta-dums itself and then makes a fearful
wound. As much metal as possible should
be discarded from uniforms and body equip-
ment. Another error. Many of the vests
are finished off at the neck like a waistcoat,
instead of having a high collar or hood for
the protection of face and ears. It’s useful
to remember that these “waistcoats” are worn
outside the tunics. t
How .these wheezes keep repeating' them-
selves in the old places! A Sydney Free-
trade daily urges the States to be cautious
and not catch too many fish, as “they can-
not be exported.” This same demented
oracle wants the duty on imported fish swept
in order that “trade may not be em-
barrassed.” It appears to think that Aus-
tralia should live on fish exported by other
people, who put the goods up in.handy tin
parcels which can be thrown into ships and
pulled out again and stacked up in ware-
houses. Australia only handed Uncle Sam
a mere quarter of a million last year for
fish, and might easily make it a million if
we left the local bream and flathead alone.
Nobody can accuse the Tasmanian Labor
Government of harboring State Spites, any-
way. In his financial statement, delivered
the other day, Treasurer Lyons declared that
the present was not a fitting time to impose
new State taxation, as “the Commonwealth
Government has to bear the burden of the
war for Australia, and there should be no
attempt by any State to pre-empt the Aus-
tralian Parliament’s field of taxation.” But
to entirely cover itself with glory, the Earle-
Lyons Government must do one thing more.
It isn’t enough to abstain from new taxa-
tion : it is also necessary to be so economical
that there is no need for new taxation. A
Treasurer doesn’t earn fame by simply let-
ting the bills pile up on the file.
The three sons of Presbyterian-parson
John Spalding, of Ararat (Vic.), volunteered
for service. One of them was turned down for
short sight and another for short teeth. The
third, Keith, has but one eye, and. was re-
garded by the family as a forlorn hope. . He
was the only one accepted, however, and is
now on his way to the war-zone as an ambu-
lance hand. When not at war he is a
dentist.

The Inky Way.
“Banjo” Paterson butts into the war from
still another angle: he goes to Egypt as a
remount officer to help look after the horses
there, and thus release a fighting man.
From a Victorian paper’s S. Aus. tele-
grams :
Mr. R. E. Bates, veteran mail contractor, and
two pieces, are missing. It is believed that they
were drowned when their boat upset near Kangaroo
Island.
That’s a nice thing to say about a reputable
uncle! ''
“Copy Boy”: The Argus is running a
snob serial written by a real live peeress.
The first chapter begins thus: —
Lord St. Osryth was having his hair cut!
Follow a couple of paragraphs in which
it is explained that the way a man’s hair is
cut “decides at once whether he is a bounder
or a gentleman.” Then we read how the
barber contemplates m’lud’s thatch with a
shocked expression and inquires where it
was last sub-edited. M’lud announces that
the job was done in the “colonies.” Then:—
“I thought so,” said the man with an air of con-
tempt that consigned the whole of the colonies, and
colonial hairdressers in particular, to some far-away
scrapheap where things of no importance should be
chucked. “I thought so.”
“Yes, it looks a bit odd,” remarked his Lordship.
“It makes me look a bit ,of a blackguard, eh?”
“1 wouldn’t say that, my Lord : but it doesn’t do
for London.”
You see the position? So long as we allow
"colonials” to cut our hair we will simply
have to go on looking like boundahs. And
we actually support newspapers to tell us so.
“II.” : I see mention of Rupert Atkinson’s
inheritance of £30,000, as though that were
all he has to be proud of. The tall, red-
haired poet was never yet a worshipper of
money, and he is one of the few'people in
the world who really deserve to have it and
can be trusted to wisely use it. Rupert’s
material thirty thousand is as nothing to
him compared with his beautiful wife. His
two boys, Toby and Lionel (their first
appearance in print), inherit an equal share
of good looks from their handsome parents.
By the way, Atkinson proposes publishing
a new book of verses early inJ9l6; pictures
and cover decoration by his Triend Hugh
McCrae.
*** * -
“Vagabond”: I haven’t had the luck to
read any of Bean’s war copy; but I have
read enough of his other prose 'to be able
to kick with both feet in protest against the'
opinion of “W.A.R.” and “R.” and others
that Bean is no more than a “reporter,” and
therefore too small for his job. “On the
Wooltrack” I should have thought; was alone
enough to prove Bean outside the ruck of
mere reporters. Any but a master hand'
might have provided nothing but a dreary
tabulation of facts and figures. Bean made
the subject live, made every line full of.
interest, and must have made any handler of'
jumbucks, from the squatter king to the
picker-up or rouseabout, throw a chest of
pride at his connection with the great Aus-
tralian industry. I certainly don’t know
another Australian writer who has given me
such pleasant reading. His knack of in-
vesting dry-as-dust subjects- with living in-
terest is like only to that of Kipling or poor
G. W. Steevens —and perhaps in this special
line I should have put Steevens first. He
did much the same class of work as Bean
has done, and it,was his training for that
war-writing at which he fairly outshone all
other lights on the horizon.
“E.W.D.”: “L.T.A.,” referring (B.
7/10/T5) to the McCauglian skit in the
“Passing Show” column of Melbourne
Argus, should have credited the verses to
Davison Symmons, not John Sandes. Doubt-
less ere this Mr. Sandes will have himself
corrected “L.T.A.’s” statement. Of course
the skit does not appear among Symmons’s
“Satires and Verses” (published a few
months after his death in 1903) on account
of the libel suit aforesaid.
SO INTENSELY PLEASANT!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mrs. George Wemyss has followed lip “The Pro-
fessional Aunt” with “Grannie-for-Granted,” a story
much in the same vein. We are introduced to a
number of pleasant people with pleasant children,
who live' and move and have their being in a
pleasant atmosphere. Grannie is the confidante and
the benevolent dea ex machina of all, and though the
book is an unsubstantial trifle, it is a very agreeable
one.— Literary review.
Wonders will never cease! Our dear, old friends —
Our kind, benevolent, earthly guides and goddesses—
Put into print! What happiness this lends, and yet
how weirdly odd this is!
Auntie and Grandma —venerable dames!
The great Twin Sistern of our social system,
Who loathe all small deceits and sinful games, nor
ever wist ’em!
High on Mount Moral Rectitude they rear
Their stately thrones, whence, Jove-like, thundering,
They hurl their fiery leaders, far and near, at mor-
tals blundering!
The winged word, the scorching blame, the ray
Of burning indignation, and the zealous
Reproof they each distribute every day among us
fellows,
Who (knowing them for Pillars of the State,
Apart, august, despising filthy lucre)
Accept their measured verdict, as of Fate, whom
none can euchre!
It is of these I sing in accents loud,
And with a not-unpardonable insistence;
Where Missus George Wemyss leads I’m proud to
follow —at a distance !
The kindest-hearted creatures in the world ;
Easily moved to gaiety and laughter ;
Who, when their heaviest thunderbolts are hurled,
are often sorry after!
Grandma and Auntie ! scrupulously' just,
Ready to guide or censure prince or peasant,
Or make the lot of Loan-fiends on the bust extremely
pleasant!
Ready to point a moral, pitch a tale,
Warn and instruct, condemn, applaud, impassion,
Minimise, soothe—nor fail to do it in a pleasant
fashion !

HOW I GOT RID OF MY GREY HAIR
After Having: Been Completely Grey Since the Age of 28.
A Simple, Harmless Method, which can he used in One’s Own Home with Complete Success.
By MARY K. CHAPMAN.
Tam a woman who belongs to a prematurely grey-haired family. My
father was grey before he was 30. and two of my brothers, as well
as my sister, became grey early in life. Before the age of 25 1
developed grey hairs, which became quite embarrassing to
me —socially and also in business. I lost three good
positions for no other reason than my fading hair.
The greyness increased with alarming rapidity, and at
28 I looked like a woman of 45. One day 1 was
seriously thinking of buying one of the numerous
Grey Hair Bestorers that are extensively advertised
when I casually mentioned the subject to an
acquaintance —a scientific man, and, as I learnt
afterwards, a great student of the Chemistry of the
Hair. He strongly advised me to have nothing to do
with these concoctions; he said they were nothing more
than simple “dyes'’ or “stains.” He pointed out that
such preparations eventually ruined the hair, and in the
meantime deceived nobod}', not even the casual observer.
He suggested that I try a formula that he had
perfected after a considerable time, that by a certain
chemical action on the pigmentary coloring cells restored the
hair to its natural color. In reply to my inquiries he assured
A
m
: v
My appearance to-
day is a delight to
myself and a sur-
prise to my friends.
me that the formula was not only absolutely harmless, hut would develop
a Strong and Beautiful Growth of Hair. My friend wrote out
this prescription, which I had made up, and after following
the instructions for a few days 1 was surprised and
delighted to find my hair becoming richer and darker in
tone. The re-coloring process continued until after some
few weeks my hair actually once again possessed the
natural shade of my girlish days. Since then I have
bean inundated with inquiries from friends and also
| from persons unknown to me, who came to hear of
this wonderful preparation. Having become con-
vinced that I have-found a remedy of extraordinary
merit, and which is quite harmless, I have resolved to
offer it for sale, as I am certain from my own experience
that it will prove an inestimable boon to any man or woman
who finds Grey Hair to be the same serious handicap it was
to me. If you are interested in this wonderful prepara-
tion, I am willing to send you complete instructions,
lEEE, under plain sealed cover.
Address Mrs. MAEY K. CHAPMAN',

UNSOLICITED TESTIMONY.
Sheep Hills, Vic. .
Dear Madam,— Having received your letter I ordered one large bottle of your
•Genuine Specific,” which I received safely some time ago, and am well satisfied with
it. Thanking you for the trouble of writing again.—l am, yours respectfully, X.D.
To Mrs. Mary K. Chapman. Wiseman's Terry, Hawkesbury River.
Dear Madam,—lt would be more than remiss ot me not to write to you and tell
you how much pleased and astonished I am at the efficacy and s o f "
“Genuine Specific” for grey hair. It is nothing short of a:marvellous seientiHc
discoverv. Is'o one need now have grey hair unless they want to haie it. . A .
greatly struck with the manner your pamphlet was written. There wasi a ““‘J*
air about it which impressed me. I do not care to have my name a PP« ar ‘”
advertisement, but you can refer anyone to me privately. I m W j ,!Ld a hair-
this colony, and naturally do not wish to set it on the housetop that I used a hair
< 0l0 it ?s S indeed ‘remarkable that you apply a liquid as clear as spring water to
to bone, to your skin, without any result, and that the cork in the bottle can remain
for weeks in contact with the liquid without being discolored, the only thing it seems
to effect is HAIR. Wishing you all the success which the discovery is worth> of,
Mrs. Mary Chapman. Rose Bay.
Dear Madam, —I have used one small bottle of your Hair Specific, and lam highly
pleased with it; nearly all my grey hairs have disappeared.
My hair has returned to its color rtf youthful days. It is simply marvellous the
effect your specific has had on it. I never expected to get anything half so good.
I never intend to have grey hairs while I can get your Specific. Why should I? It is
so clean, too; does not stain the skin nor the clothing. Send me another bottle now,
so that I can keep it right by an occasional application. You can use this letter if
you wish, but not the name. Send bottle by return, cheque enclosed.
—Yours faithfully, J.A.B.
Mrs. Mary K. Chapman. Kurri Kurri
Dear Madam, —Your letter received yesterday greatly surprised me on first sight,
but now conclude that my order for large bottle —which I duly received and acknow-
ledged by return mail has beon overlooked by yon—also after three weeks’ application
I wrote you stating that I wars well pleased with results attained by using your
“Genuine Specific.” I am still using the remedy occasionally,. and have not got,
through the supply yet.
I consider myself fortunate in procuring your Specific in my only attempt to get
rid of grey hair, without wasting time, etc., on other remedies. Best assured that I
will always advise the use of jfour “Genuine Specific.”—Yours gratefully, J.J.E.
IMPORTANT.
Mrs. Chapman’s Preparation is certainly
a most wonderful discovery for the Cure
of Grey Hair, and readers of either sex
who are “ ageing ” through greyness
should obtain further information.

STRENGTH COMES
not from What You Eat,
but from What You Digest.
Did your last meal taste deliciously good
to you, and did you eat all you wanted?
Could you have patted your rotundity In
glee and felt proud of your appetite and
of your good, strong stomach? Do you
feel rosy now because your last meal
gave you no inconvenience whatever? If
not, you have Dyspepsia in some form,
and probably never realised it.
If you have the least trouble in your
stomach after eating, no matter how
little or how much you eat, there is
trouble brewing, and you must correct
it at once.
Most all stomach troubles come from
poor, weak, scanty gastric juice, that
precious liquid which ought to turn your
food into rich, red blood.
If you have Nausea, your gastric juice is
weak. If you have sour risings or belch-
ings, your food is fermenting; your gas-
tric juice is weak. If you have loss of
appetite, your gastric juice is weak. If
you have a bloaty feeling of aversion to
food, your gastric juice is weak.
l'ou need something in your stomach to
supply the gastric juice which is scanty,
and to give power to the weak gastric
juice.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules do this
very thing.
Now, think, one grain of one of the in-
gredients of these wonderful little tab-
ules digests 3000 grains of food. They
are several times more powerful than the
gastric juice in a good, strong, powerful
stomach. They actually digest your food
for you. Besides, they increase the flow
of gastric juice—just what you need to
get all the good possible out of every-
thing you eat. You will never have that
“lump of lead” in your stomach nor any
other stomach trouble after taking Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules. Then every-
thing you eat will be digested; they will
give you strength, vim, energy and a
rosy dispositon. You’ll feel good all
round your waist line after every meal,
and they will make you feel good all
over.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules will
make you feel happy after eating a good,
hearty meal. Take one or two after eat-
ing. You’ll feel fine, then your meals
will fit, no matter wliat or when you eat.
You should always have a tin of Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules on your din-
ing-table. They will make you get all
the good possible out of everything you
eat, and you’ll enjoy it.
Make Your Stomach Strong 8 Healthy
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are sold everywhere at 1/6 per tin of 36 Tabules,
and 2/6 per tin of 80 Tabules. Buy a tin, eat a good, square meal, and then take
the Tabules according to directions, and note the result. You will forget all about
it if you are not careful, for there will be No Pain or disturbance, and the food will
be Digested just as it used to be when your Stomach was Well and Strong. Fur-
thermore, your stomach will soon be restored again, if you keep on taking them,
just as thousands upon thousands of other stomachs have been, by the sole and
exclusive use of Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules.

BERNARD INGLEBY.
A Lesson in Battling.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I GOT it from the “Lost Cat” himself,
when last we foregathered at Nolan's
pub. This was a famous rendezvous
for travellers of all kinds in the days when
there were few railways. A line waterliole
full of fish, plenty of wood for firing, and
proximity to cheap liquor when a man came
along with a cheque. It was a good camp-
ing ground for stock, and battlers could often
get beef, flour, tea and even tobacco from
the drovers in return for fresh fish.
It was late when I arrived at the pub on
the very last occasion I saw Nolan’s, and
the first voice I heard was the “Lost Cat’s.”
He and the landlord were playing euchre
and he was saying, “As for me, as pussy
says in the book, I have but wan thrick. an'
it that fails me I am indade a losht (rat.
Euchre 1 an’ game! The dhrinks are up to
ye. Nolan. I did well to bate sich a fine
player as ye.”
We foregathered afterwards over our
liquor (I was host), and in reply to a ques-
tion the “Lost Cat” said, “Sometimes I’m
asked that quistion, an’ for one raison or
another I’ve not told. Why shouldn’t I tell
now? ’Twill do no liarrm. I’m a battler be
lovin’ the freedom av the game ; be the love av
change: an’ be the battle av my wits wid
those av the whole world. I’ll tell ye first
why I became a battler, an’ it’s a common-
place tale.
“I was a lad av three an’ twinty whin I
landed from Ireland in Melbourne, wid all
me sorrows before me, God help me! an’ a
clane fightin’ ancisthry behind me. After
I’d been here a few days I thought I’d like
to kape a pub, like my cousin Martin, who
had a fine one on the Sandridge-road in
those days. ’Twas the great time he was
havin’. Atin’ an' shlapin’ an’ dhrinkin’
whinever he liked. I knew I had a long
way to go to get that fur, but I was
ambitious. I lukked for a job o’ worrk. I
helped to build railways. I saved every
sixpence an’ scraped an’ scraped, until I
had a few hundreds. To get them I did
widout. Anybody who’s done that when
they were young an’ sthrong, an’ whin the
red blood is in their veins, knows what a
dreadful thing it is to do. It’s doin’ the
manest things to yeer youth an’ the youth
av others for dirty money which is av no
use when ye have it and ye’re old. Five
years I did it, an’ sah no more av life than
three feeds a day an’ some wather; an’ had
four hundred pounds in the bank, wid a
mane soul. Oh, an’ the fine girls I passed
by to marry a red-headed widdy an’ five kids.
“She had a pub on the railway buildin’ iu
the Goulburn Valley, an’ I thought it was a
short cut to an aisy life like Martin, me
cousin in Sandridge. I found that I had
married a blazin’ divil afther she got my
money. I learned to drink stlirong drink,
an’ she gev me cause to fight wid other min,
an’ I became bad.
“Whin the railway passed, the pub was
no good, so I cleared, an’ was brought back
by the poliss. Then I sah somethin’ an’ I
bate her, an’ was gaoled for it. In the end
I losht my money, my youth an’ ambition
for annythin’ at all. Frum bein’ a saver I
became a spender, an’ I kem at lasht to bo
a battler. I’m glad av it, for I haven’t a
want or a care in life, an’ I’m richer than
Tyson. Ye may laugh. Wait let ye, an’
lissen.
“All a man wants is tucker. Three feeds
a day, an’ a good appetite to ait them with.
For twenty-five years I’ve bin full-fed ex-
cep’in’ wanst, whin I was caught by the
flood-waters of the Paroo. They didn’t go
down for five days, an’ for three av them I
ate nothing. That was the act of God, and
might happen to anywan. I earn my three
feeds a day be the exercise of my brains,
an’ oh, the joy av batin’ a hungry station
fer tucker! Many an’ many’s the time I’ve
liked the thrick better than the food that
was the fruits av it. As ye know, I have
but wan —well then, I’ll not say it, but I
vary the thrick according to circumstances.”
The old fellow stopped and chuckled
reminiscently, and a hard, dry chuckle it
was.
"I got tucker wanst be givin’ lessons iu
battlin’. Would ye like to hear it? Ye
know Baiulybelah? Ye do! Ye know then
that it’s the hungriest station on the Rivers.
Xo man ever gets a feed for himself or his
horses there. I was camped on the Bandy-
belali waterhole wanst. I was runnin’ short
o’ tucker, an’ was thinkin’ o’ movin’ on,
when one night a cove rode up leadin’ a
pack-horse. They were both done, an’ there
wasn’t a skerriek o’ grass on the main re-
serve. The cove must ha’ known the repu-
tation of the station. No hope o’ stealin’
grass there. The overseer was as keen as
they make thim. When I said ‘Good aven-
in’!’ he looked sour. Then I could see what
was ailin’ him, an’ I was sorry for the dumb
bastes, so I sez, ‘There’s a way to bate
Smiffkins an’ his overseer fer grass.’ ITe
sez quick, ‘What is ut? I’ll do anythin’
short o’ gaol to get these poor bastes a feed.’
I sez, ‘Play the looney.’
“ ‘What?’ sez he.
“I sez, ‘Lissen to me.’ So I told him, an’
at the end sez. ‘Be sure to get a written
order, too, because ye might meet the over-
seer cornin’ home. He’s no mug, aither.’
“The cove wasn’t a battler or he’d ha’
known aisily what to do, so I dolled him up
~as a Tooney, an’ he was a pickcheiv It is a
favorite thrick o’ mine, an’ I carry the
necessary. People don't like loonies, an’ evil!
give annything to get them away. So he
ties his horses up to a three, an’ off he goes.
Half an hour later back he came, as pleased
as a dog wid two tails.
“ ‘Did it worrk ?’ sez I.
“ fit did,’ sez he.
“ ‘Tell me,’ sez 1.,
“‘I will whin. I’ve taken the horses to
feed. It’s gettin’ near sundown.’ he sez.
“He went off about half a mile where
there was lashins o’.grass, an’ whin he came
back it’s the happy man he was. An’ thin
he told me. ‘I wint up to the big house, an’
there was a crowd o’ women on the big
verandah, an’ ole Smiffkins himself. 1
pranced up on a saplin’ an’ leadin’ another
just like a four-tooth kid. The women gev
a little squeal when they sah me, an’ old
Smiffkins came down the steps in a hurry.
He sez, “What do yer want here, my good
feller?” I sez, “Can’t yer see that me
horses are knocked up an’ can’t go on?”
“You can’t stay here, me poor feller,” he
sez, an’ I told him I didn’t want to, an’ that
I was camped on the creek, an’ I wanted
grass for my horses in the horse paddock.
“Certainly you can,” sez he. “Off you go.”
I told him I wanted a written order, as
the overseers an’ boundary-riders everywhere
were hard on travellers’ horses. One of the
ladies squeaks from the verandah, “For
Ilivin’s sake let him have the order, George,
an’ sind him away to the creek.” So George
got me the order, an’ I pranced off down
the track on my stick, an’ T must ha’ bin
pretty funny to Ink at. for they all laughed
till I turned the corner.’
“Next mornin’ the cove wint to the pad-
duck at five o'clock. But early an' all as it.
was, the horses were tied up to a rail in the
yard, and the overseer was lookin’ at ’em.
“He wint to the overseer an’ sez, ‘Those
are my horses.’
“‘I Was wondherin,’ sez he. ‘They’re
pounded now. an’ I’ll take you to the town-
ship for trispass. Tt'll be a dear bit av
grass ye’ll have had.’
“Then the cove showed him the order, an’
the overseer was flabbergasted. Sich a
thing hadn’t happened in a blue moon. He
lukked at the cove, an’ at the order, an’
back at the cove, an’ sez. ‘How in the name
av Hivin did ye get this?’
“ ‘Just told him my tale, an’ he wrote it
out. One of the ladies begged him to do ut.’
“ ‘Hum-m.’ sez the overseer. ‘Yeer a
miracle. Take the horses, an’ take a ticket
in the big sweep.’
“Whin the chap kem back to camp, he
sez, ‘Now watcher want fer doin’ that?’
“I sez. ‘Some spare tucker if ye have
any.’
“He turned out his pack-bags an’ gev me
flour, tea, tobaccer, tinned stuff, an’ wanted
t<> give me money, too, but I don’t iver ax
fer cash. It’s a principle o’ mine, an’ gits
me a feed when I can’t get it other ways.
He went off to the township an’ the story
got -into the papers.
“Thar illustbrates wan av the joys av a
rale battler’s life. I bate the hungriest
owner an’ the sharpest overseer on the
rivers, just wud one lesson.” _

/THE CHEMIST SAID*
“ USE ZAM-BUK.”
Man's Distressing Skin Trouble Banished
After Other Treatments Failed.
MR. ELTON, whose,
skin was made heallliji
by Zam-Duk.
PEOPLE qualified to know heartily
recommend Zam-Buk after other
remedies fail. Mr. Claude H. Elton,
of 196 Gore Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne,
says:—“While touring New South Wales
some time ago a nasty skin disease attacked
me, caused through overheating of the
blood. It appeared to be a sort of eczema,
while one doctor diagnosed it as South
African itch. The irritation was dreadful,
and I could not keep my hands from it,
and I lost weight on account of the worry.
The disease first appeared in the shape of
small pimples, and then became moist, and
gave off matter.
“I had been bad for some time, and was
suffering greatly from the excessive irrita-
tion, when I consulted a chemist, who ad-
vised me to use Zam-Buk. I went home
and had a very hot bath, and then applied
Zam-Buk to the affected places. The result
was delightful, for all irritation and pain
were taken away. I continued applying
Zam-Buk until the disease was cured, and
no signs of any spots or pimples remained.
“Since that time Zam-Buk has been found invaluable in the home, and
my wife has also used it with beneficial results.”
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
Zam-Buk is invaluable in the home,
workshop, and on the farm, sheep-run
and cattle-station. Zam-Buk soothes and
heals skin injuries, and prevents wounds
taking bad ways. The handy pot of Zam-
Buk ensures freedom from festering and
blood poison in all cases of cuts,
scratches, gashes, burns, scalds and sores.
Zam-Buk is excellent for eczema, ulcers,

sore feet and other skin troubles. • Of all

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MR. PODDISH came into the front
hall with a discontented air, and
sniffed.
“Dinner!” he half-whispered. “The
smell o’ dinner always did put me off my
dinner.”
“What’* that?” demanded Mrs. Poddish.
putting her head out of the kitchen.
“Smell o’ dinner,” briefly replied Mr.
Poddish.
Mrs. Poddish withdrew her head, but con-
tinued the conversation.
“Lucky to have a dinner to smell,” she
said. “If y’ were in the trenches y’ wouldn’t
have a smell o’ dinner to worry about.”
Mr. Poddish went into the bathroom,
where he hastily turned on a loud stream
of water.
“Water... .splashing. . . .water... .floor. .
. .don’t... .more work for me!” urged his
wife.
“Gr-rmph!” grunted Mr. roddisli. and
turned off the tap. “I gutter wash meself.”'
“Lucky to be able to wash at ali, without
flooding the place out. Y’ wouldn’t get that
sort o’ wash in the trenches.”
“ Bust the trenches!” whispered Mr.
Poddish, and blew refreshingly through his
moustache.
As he stood at the bathroom mirror, with
one eye on his wild hair as lie towelled it,
and the other taking an appreciative glance
through the window at the Fortuniana rose
which blossomed upon the lattice outside,
Poddish was in tw r o minds —one, not happy,
dwelling upon the unnecessary irks of
domestic life on a modest competence, with
one wife and no children, backed by an
unpretentious city billet; the other, mildly
uplifted in anticipation of a quarter-hour
of gardening before the evening meal. Pod-
dish was great on health and the things that
make therefor. Gardening was one of these.
He finished drying his hair, arranged it
neatly across his pale brow with the brush
which hung neatly below the neat mirror,
and stood there a moment at the open win-
dow, enjoying the rose-blooms. They were
quite close. A towel-horse stood beneath
the window. Poddish put a foot upon it
and raised himself, gingerly, reaching for a
rose.
“What you doing ?” came the voice of
Mrs. Poddish from the kitchen.
Poddish picked himself up and
straightened out the dislocated horse, in
some haste.
“Nothing,” he said, carelessly. Then, rais-
ing his voice: “It’s orright. Knocked over
the towel-tliing. It’s orright.”
Mrs. Poddish appeared in the doorway,
a fork in her hand and her eyes gleaming
brightly.
“Always knocking the furniture about,
she muttered, making for the disordered
towels and placing them neatly across the
horse. “Don’t seem to appreciate having
things tidy. Now, if y’ had to live in the
trenches
All the red blood in Poddish’s body tingled
and seemed to rush suddenly to the top of
liis head. Poddish would have described his
feelings that way, at any rate. He strode
out of the house and made for the tool-shed.
Mrs. Poddish came out immediately to
the back verandah.
“Dinner’s ready,” she called peremptorily.
With a sigh compounded of wrath and
resignation, Mr. Poddish restored his rake
to its resting-place against the wall of the
tool-shed and made for the house once more.
“I always like, if possible,” he said to
Mrs. Poddish, with meticulous if cool polite-
ness, “to do a few minutes’ gardening before
dinner. I find it gives me an appetite.”
“Appetite!” scoffed his wife. “If you’ve
had nothing since lunch-time y’ oughtn’t to
want to work for an appetite.”
Poddish took his seat.
“I had a cup of afternoon tea at four
o’clock,” he said. “I always do, y’ know.
Particularly this warm weather.”
Placing a large plate of hot, roast meat
before him, with potatoes and cabbage, Mrs.
Poddish proceeded to her own place at table.
“Y’d do better with your appetite if y’
dropped that tea-business. Now, if y’ were
in the trenches”
“Yes, I know,” returned Mr. Poddish,
desperately, “but I’m not in the trenches. ’
And went unhappily on with his dinner.
“Plenty of others are,” said Mrs. Pod-
dish, and went snappily on with hers.
The evening passed, with Mr. Poddish in
an unusually silent and thoughtful mood.
Next morning he got up and bustled out
into the garden long before breakfast, with
an appearance of unwonted cheerfulness.
Presently he ate a large, cheerful meal and
went lightbeartedly off to the city, humming
a hackneyed but very cheerful marching-
song.
That evening, in the same old way,. Mr.
Poddish opened the front gate, negotiated
the fussy curves of the garden path,
entered the hall and stood there with his
hat in his hand, sniffing a new dinner-smell.
This time, however, he said nothing, but
waited a moment with a thoughtful expres-
sion on his open countenance.
Mrs. Poddish put her head out of the
kitchen.
“If y’ don’t hurry with your washing, the
dinner’ll be spoilt. Y’ wouldn’t have any
time for standing around" like that if y’
were in the”
Mr. Poddish stepped along to the bath-
room and shut the door softly on the
word. After a moment, however, still
thoughtfully, he opened it again. Now
he had a tape-measure in. his hand
and his coat off. He ran the tape closely
around under his armpits, and then slacked
it and examined the figures.
Mrs. Poddish had her head out of the
kitchen door, once more.
“Thirty-nine,” he lmlf-whispered, after
his own peculiar habit. Then, more loudly
and confidently, and with a shade of grati-
fication in his tone: “Thirty-nine.”
“Thirty-nine what?” Mrs. Poddish asked
pettishly, rising to the bait.
“Inches,” replied Poddish. “Thirty-nine
round the chest. Height: Five foot five.”
He put on his coat, threw, back his
shoulders, went to the hall, seized a hat
with a groping movement.
“Where you going?” demanded Mrs.
Poddish.
“Going to see what it is like in the busted
trenches,” answered Poddish, and so opened
the door and streamed down the street,
heading for the recruiting-station.
FRANK HENTY.
The Jest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I THE FOOT-BOY changed the glasses,
changed the glasses for a jest,
And a blind chance did the rest!
For his goblet tall and golden
Held a vintage rare and olden,
And hers held some amber sherbet, foamy
stuff and rather sickly.
Pressed against the wall I waited where the
curtain folds fell thickly ;
When my prank was all perfected I was
doubled up with laughter,
Knowing his dull eyes close peering
Never could have found my jeering;
So liis curses at mischances would come
swiftly rolling after!
He would rage at table servers, damn the
house from roof to cellar
Not to know a wine from sherbet! Out
upon the faulty fellow!
She would sit with smooth face smileless,
Little throat, and manner guileless,
And her small white bosom even as the pearls
upon her shoulders,
With the look of gentle suffering that she has
for all beholders
Turned upon his purple anger,
In her poise an added languor.
Ah! I know the hidden terrace where the
lazy jasmines tumble
And the cloaked postillions waiting, and the
black mask in the rumble,
And the bright-eyed, restless lover
Where the rustling trees bend over!
When the moon was high last even what
would the foot-boy be missing
Of a white hand at a lattice, and the kissing,
kissing, kissing !
Red-haired Kasmine, come from Venice,
stillroom mistress to the Master,
When she poured the wine this evening, did
her strange heart beat the faster?
Beady eyes and banded tresses, prim-pinched
mouth and noiseless dresses,
I, who hid behind the window, saw the
precious goblets shine
And the last sun-ray a-quiver, on the ruby
stream of wine,
To the tall, cool drink of sherbet in its
cracked Venetian glass.
Twice across the shimmering surface I saw
Rasinine’s fingers pass.
On her thumb a ring was slipping,
With a click the vessel lipping,
Ring of silver, oddly fashioned, siguet of a
snake-green head.
Something that the Master gave her in a
day of summers dead.
And it set me thinking, thinking,
While the last red light was winking,
Of the lichened grey-stone terrace and the
two lost in the shadow,
Of the shut-eyed daisies trampled and the
gate beyond the meadow,
And how skeins in life get tangled—-
Hates that knot, and love-dreams mangled.
Dust behind the arras staining all the nearl
silk of his hose,
Who cares what the foot-boy ponders? Silly
pate that ever wanders !
But the meddling of his fingers, it may mat-
ter. What man knows?
So it happened that I heard him, sunken-
eyed, hump-backed, the Master!
As his stick tapped, faster, faster,
And the Mistress tripped beside him, shoes
like rose leaves, eyes like Heaven,
Hand like snow-flake on his coat sleeve, and
a spirit over driven !
With her pale gold lashes falling on a cheek
grown sick for kisses
And her tiny breasts uplifting, hungry for
ungarnered blisses !
They were seated, stately, silent, each end of
the linened table,
Fruits between, and shining dishes, rich as
something in a fable
To the greedy foot-boy watching,
Fancy bites at viands snatching,
Till she came to taste her sherbet, and he
came to drink his wine,
And she choked on ancient vintage, brought
her by this jest of mine!
Was she thinking of the darkness, and the
sound a dropped latch makes,
Or, in corridors, night-hollow, echoes that a
footfall wakes?
But wbat could he have been thinking
That he went on drinking, drinking
Thirstily the changed sherbet? Twins were
these Venetian glasses
As one used by a magician out of which
fresh liquid passes !
Where was Rasmine? In some corner
She, the scorned, became the scorner,
With her grey-streaked Titian tresses and
her gown laced up with gold—
Payment for forgotten tradings—llate grown
hot, and passion cold.
Where was Rasmine? Where was Rasmine?
I fell back, a-reel with fear.
W r here was Rasmine? Where was Rasmine?
Did it matter? Death was here!
And the lover on the terrace, hid among the
quaint, clipped hedges,
Perfumed like a very bridegroom, coat
embroidered to the edges,
Must have wondered at the uproar in the
house of lighted casements.
Minions flying, maidens shrieking, from the
attics to the basements.
Let him take his bribed postillions to their
supper at the inn ;
Let him wait for love next summer, then it
will not look like sin !
Rasmine will return to Venice; poisonings
there are managed neatly.
I can keep as secret surely what a chance
jest does so featly !
Who’s the murderer? 1...'.0r Rasmine?
God of Chance, ’tis he who knows.
/ know nothing! lam busy.... rubbing
dust smears from my hose!

Is “Economy”
Your
Watchword ?
If so you will be deeply
interested in the increased
steaming power of your boiler,
the more satisfactory working
of your engine, the greater
efficiency of your whole plant,
and, further, the big reduction
in your fuel bill, all of which
can be accomplished by the
adoption of
Newall’s Magnesia
Sectional Steam
Pipe Coverings and
Plastic Boiler
Covering
the EXCEPTIONAL EFFICIENCY of which has placed it
FAR ABOVE ALL OTHER MATERIALS.
The above claims are not merely “idle words,’’ but are all
clinched by FACTS-: —in evidence of which we might mention
that Newall’s Coverings have been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments, and have been used throughout
Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses, in addition to which we have
orders on hand for the insulating throughout of Perth, Melbourne
and Canberra Power Stations.
Should further argument be necessary, we append the comparative
covering capacities of Newall’s Plastic Boiler Covering and ordinary
asbestos.
lcwt. ordinary asbestos will cover 40 sq. ft. x lin. thick.
lcwt. Newall’s Plastic Magnesia will cover 100 sq. ft. x lin.
